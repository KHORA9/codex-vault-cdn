This Prince, in the year 1744, while\r\n      hastening from one end of his kingdom to the other, and\r\n      suspending his conquests in Flanders that he might fly to the\r\n      assistance of Alsace, was arrested at Metz by a malady which\r\n      threatened to cut short his days. At the news of this, Paris, all\r\n      in terror, seemed a city taken by storm: the churches resounded\r\n      with supplications and groans; the prayers of priests and people\r\n      were every moment interrupted by their sobs: and it was from an\r\n      interest so dear and tender that this Surname of _Bien-aimé_\r\n      fashioned itself—a title higher still than all the rest which\r\n      this great Prince has earned.”[1]\r\n\r\n      So stands it written; in lasting memorial of that year 1744.\r\n      Thirty other years have come and gone; and “this great Prince”\r\n      again lies sick; but in how altered circumstances now! Churches\r\n      resound not with excessive groanings; Paris is stoically calm:\r\n      sobs interrupt no prayers, for indeed none are offered; except\r\n      Priests’ Litanies, read or chanted at fixed money-rate per hour,\r\n      which are not liable to interruption. The shepherd of the people\r\n      has been carried home from Little Trianon, heavy of heart, and\r\n      been put to bed in his own Château of Versailles: the flock knows\r\n      it, and heeds it not. At most, in the immeasurable tide of French\r\n      Speech (which ceases not day after day, and only ebbs towards the\r\n      short hours of night), may this of the royal sickness emerge from\r\n      time to time as an article of news. Bets are doubtless depending;\r\n      nay, some people “express themselves loudly in the streets.”[2]\r\n      But for the rest, on green field and steepled city, the May sun\r\n      shines out, the May evening fades; and men ply their useful or\r\n      useless business as if no Louis lay in danger.\r\n\r\n      Dame Dubarry, indeed, might pray, if she had a talent for it;\r\n      Duke d’Aiguillon too, Maupeou and the Parlement Maupeou: these,\r\n      as they sit in their high places, with France harnessed under\r\n      their feet, know well on what basis they continue there. Look to\r\n      it, D’Aiguillon; sharply as thou didst, from the Mill of St.\r\n      Cast, on Quiberon and the invading English; thou, “covered if not\r\n      with glory yet with meal!” Fortune was ever accounted inconstant:\r\n      and each dog has but his day.\r\n\r\n      Forlorn enough languished Duke d’Aiguillon, some years ago;\r\n      covered, as we said, with meal; nay with worse. For La Chalotais,\r\n      the Breton Parlementeer, accused him not only of poltroonery and\r\n      tyranny, but even of _concussion_ (official plunder of money);\r\n      which accusations it was easier to get “quashed” by backstairs\r\n      Influences than to get answered: neither could the thoughts, or\r\n      even the tongues, of men be tied. Thus, under disastrous eclipse,\r\n      had this grand-nephew of the great Richelieu to glide about;\r\n      unworshipped by the world; resolute Choiseul, the abrupt proud\r\n      man, disdaining him, or even forgetting him. Little prospect but\r\n      to glide into Gascony, to rebuild Châteaus there,[3] and die\r\n      inglorious killing game! However, in the year 1770, a certain\r\n      young soldier, Dumouriez by name, returning from Corsica, could\r\n      see “with sorrow, at Compiègne, the old King of France, on foot,\r\n      with doffed hat, in sight of his army, at the side of a\r\n      magnificent phaeton, doing homage to the—Dubarry.”[4]\r\n\r\n      Much lay therein! Thereby, for one thing, could D’Aiguillon\r\n      postpone the rebuilding of his Château, and rebuild his fortunes\r\n      first. For stout Choiseul would discern in the Dubarry nothing\r\n      but a wonderfully dizened Scarlet-woman; and go on his way as if\r\n      she were not. Intolerable: the source of sighs, tears, of\r\n      pettings and pouting; which would not end till “France” (La\r\n      France, as she named her royal valet) finally mustered heart to\r\n      see Choiseul; and with that “quivering in the chin (_tremblement\r\n      du menton_)” natural in such case,[5] faltered out a dismissal:\r\n      dismissal of his last substantial man, but pacification of his\r\n      scarlet-woman. Thus D’Aiguillon rose again, and culminated. And\r\n      with him there rose Maupeou, the banisher of Parlements; who\r\n      plants you a refractory President “at Croe in Combrailles on the\r\n      top of steep rocks, inaccessible except by litters,” there to\r\n      consider himself. Likewise there rose Abbé Terray, dissolute\r\n      Financier, paying eightpence in the shilling,—so that wits\r\n      exclaim in some press at the playhouse, ‘Where is Abbé Terray,\r\n      that he might reduce us to two-thirds!’ And so have these\r\n      individuals (verily by black-art) built them a Domdaniel, or\r\n      enchanted Dubarrydom; call it an Armida-Palace, where they dwell\r\n      pleasantly; Chancellor Maupeou “playing blind-man’s-buff” with\r\n      the scarlet Enchantress; or gallantly presenting her with dwarf\r\n      Negroes;—and a Most Christian King has unspeakable peace within\r\n      doors, whatever he may have without. “My Chancellor is a\r\n      scoundrel; but I cannot do without him.”[6]\r\n\r\n      Beautiful Armida-Palace, where the inmates live enchanted lives;\r\n      lapped in soft music of adulation; waited on by the splendours of\r\n      the world;—which nevertheless hangs wondrously as by a single\r\n      hair. Should the Most Christian King die; or even get seriously\r\n      afraid of dying! For, alas, had not the fair haughty Châteauroux\r\n      to fly, with wet cheeks and flaming heart, from that Fever-scene\r\n      at Metz; driven forth by sour shavelings? She hardly returned,\r\n      when fever and shavelings were both swept into the background.\r\n      Pompadour too, when Damiens wounded Royalty “slightly, under the\r\n      fifth rib,” and our drive to Trianon went off futile, in shrieks\r\n      and madly shaken torches,—had to pack, and be in readiness: yet\r\n      did not go, the wound not proving poisoned. For his Majesty has\r\n      religious faith; believes, at least in a Devil. And now a third\r\n      peril; and who knows what may be in it! For the Doctors look\r\n      grave; ask privily, If his Majesty had not the small-pox long\r\n      ago?—and doubt it may have been a false kind. Yes, Maupeou,\r\n      pucker those sinister brows of thine, and peer out on it with thy\r\n      malign rat-eyes: it is a questionable case. Sure only that man is\r\n      mortal; that with the life of one mortal snaps irrevocably the\r\n      wonderfulest talisman, and all Dubarrydom rushes off, with\r\n      tumult, into infinite Space; and ye, as subterranean Apparitions\r\n      are wont, vanish utterly,—leaving only a smell of sulphur!\r\n\r\n      These, and what holds of these may pray,—to Beelzebub, or whoever\r\n      will hear them. But from the rest of France there comes, as was\r\n      said, no prayer; or one of an _opposite_ character, “expressed\r\n      openly in the streets.” Château or Hôtel, were an enlightened\r\n      Philosophism scrutinises many things, is not given to prayer:\r\n      neither are Rossbach victories, Terray Finances, nor, say only\r\n      “sixty thousand _Lettres de Cachet_” (which is Maupeou’s share),\r\n      persuasives towards that. O Hénault! Prayers? From a France\r\n      smitten (by black-art) with plague after plague, and lying now in\r\n      shame and pain, with a Harlot’s foot on its neck, what prayer can\r\n      come? Those lank scarecrows, that prowl hunger-stricken through\r\n      all highways and byways of French Existence, will they pray? The\r\n      dull millions that, in the workshop or furrowfield, grind\r\n      fore-done at the wheel of Labour, like haltered gin-horses, if\r\n      blind so much the quieter? Or they that in the Bicêtre Hospital,\r\n      “eight to a bed,” lie waiting their manumission? Dim are those\r\n      heads of theirs, dull stagnant those hearts: to them the great\r\n      Sovereign is known mainly as the great Regrater of Bread. If they\r\n      hear of his sickness, they will answer with a dull _Tant pis pour\r\n      lui;_ or with the question, Will he die?\r\n\r\n      Yes, will he die? that is now, for all France, the grand\r\n      question, and hope; whereby alone the King’s sickness has still\r\n      some interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.1.II.\r\n      Realised Ideals.\r\n\r\n      Such a changed France have we; and a changed Louis. Changed,\r\n      truly; and further than thou yet seest!—To the eye of History\r\n      many things, in that sick-room of Louis, are now visible, which\r\n      to the Courtiers there present were invisible. For indeed it is\r\n      well said, “in every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the\r\n      eye sees in it what the eye brings means of seeing.” To Newton\r\n      and to Newton’s Dog Diamond, what a different pair of Universes;\r\n      while the painting on the optical retina of both was, most\r\n      likely, the same! Let the Reader here, in this sick-room of\r\n      Louis, endeavour to look with the mind too.\r\n\r\n      Time was when men could (so to speak) of a given man, by\r\n      nourishing and decorating him with fit appliances, to the due\r\n      pitch, _make_ themselves a King, almost as the Bees do; and what\r\n      was still more to the purpose, loyally obey him when made. The\r\n      man so nourished and decorated, thenceforth named royal, does\r\n      verily bear rule; and is said, and even thought, to be, for\r\n      example, “prosecuting conquests in Flanders,” when he lets\r\n      himself like luggage be carried thither: and no light luggage;\r\n      covering miles of road. For he has his unblushing Châteauroux,\r\n      with her band-boxes and rouge-pots, at his side; so that, at\r\n      every new station, a wooden gallery must be run up between their\r\n      lodgings. He has not only his _Maison-Bouche_, and _Valetaille_\r\n      without end, but his very Troop of Players, with their pasteboard\r\n      coulisses, thunder-barrels, their kettles, fiddles,\r\n      stage-wardrobes, portable larders (and chaffering and quarrelling\r\n      enough); all mounted in wagons, tumbrils, second-hand\r\n      chaises,—sufficient not to conquer Flanders, but the patience of\r\n      the world. With such a flood of loud jingling appurtenances does\r\n      he lumber along, prosecuting his conquests in Flanders; wonderful\r\n      to behold. So nevertheless it was and had been: to some solitary\r\n      thinker it might seem strange; but even to him inevitable, not\r\n      unnatural.\r\n\r\n      For ours is a most fictile world; and man is the most fingent\r\n      plastic of creatures. A world not fixable; not fathomable! An\r\n      unfathomable Somewhat, which is _Not we;_ which we can work with,\r\n      and live amidst,—and model, miraculously in our miraculous Being,\r\n      and name World.—But if the very Rocks and Rivers (as Metaphysic\r\n      teaches) are, in strict language, _made_ by those outward Senses\r\n      of ours, how much more, by the Inward Sense, are all Phenomena of\r\n      the spiritual kind: Dignities, Authorities, Holies, Unholies!\r\n      Which inward sense, moreover is not permanent like the outward\r\n      ones, but forever growing and changing. Does not the Black\r\n      African take of Sticks and Old Clothes (say, exported\r\n      Monmouth-Street cast-clothes) what will suffice, and of these,\r\n      cunningly combining them, fabricate for himself an Eidolon (Idol,\r\n      or _Thing Seen_), and name it _Mumbo-Jumbo;_ which he can\r\n      thenceforth pray to, with upturned awestruck eye, not without\r\n      hope? The white European mocks; but ought rather to consider; and\r\n      see whether he, at home, could not do the like a little more\r\n      wisely.\r\n\r\n      So it _was_, we say, in those conquests of Flanders, thirty years\r\n      ago: but so it no longer is. Alas, much more lies sick than poor\r\n      Louis: not the French King only, but the French Kingship; this\r\n      too, after long rough tear and wear, is breaking down. The world\r\n      is all so changed; so much that seemed vigorous has sunk\r\n      decrepit, so much that was not is beginning to be!—Borne over the\r\n      Atlantic, to the closing ear of Louis, King by the Grace of God,\r\n      what sounds are these; muffled ominous, new in our centuries?\r\n      Boston Harbour is black with unexpected Tea: behold a\r\n      Pennsylvanian Congress gather; and ere long, on Bunker Hill,\r\n      DEMOCRACY announcing, in rifle-volleys death-winged, under her\r\n      Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee-doodle-doo, that she is born,\r\n      and, whirlwind-like, will envelope the whole world!\r\n\r\n      Sovereigns die and Sovereignties: how all dies, and is for a Time\r\n      only; is a “Time-phantasm, yet reckons itself real!” The\r\n      Merovingian Kings, slowly wending on their bullock-carts through\r\n      the streets of Paris, with their long hair flowing, have all\r\n      wended slowly on,—into Eternity. Charlemagne sleeps at Salzburg,\r\n      with truncheon grounded; only Fable expecting that he will\r\n      awaken. Charles the Hammer, Pepin Bow-legged, where now is their\r\n      eye of menace, their voice of command? Rollo and his shaggy\r\n      Northmen cover not the Seine with ships; but have sailed off on a\r\n      longer voyage. The hair of Towhead (_Tête d’étoupes_) now needs\r\n      no combing; Iron-cutter (_Taillefer_) cannot cut a cobweb; shrill\r\n      Fredegonda, shrill Brunhilda have had out their hot life-scold,\r\n      and lie silent, their hot life-frenzy cooled. Neither from that\r\n      black Tower de Nesle descends now darkling the doomed gallant, in\r\n      his sack, to the Seine waters; plunging into Night: for Dame de\r\n      Nesle now cares not for this world’s gallantry, heeds not this\r\n      world’s scandal; Dame de Nesle is herself gone into Night. They\r\n      are all gone; sunk,—down, down, with the tumult they made; and\r\n      the rolling and the trampling of ever new generations passes over\r\n      them, and they hear it not any more forever.\r\n\r\n      And yet withal has there not been realised somewhat? Consider (to\r\n      go no further) these strong Stone-edifices, and what they hold!\r\n      Mud-Town of the Borderers (_Lutetia Parisiorum_ or _Barisiorum_)\r\n      has paved itself, has spread over all the Seine Islands, and far\r\n      and wide on each bank, and become City of Paris, sometimes\r\n      boasting to be “Athens of Europe,” and even “Capital of the\r\n      Universe.” Stone towers frown aloft; long-lasting, grim with a\r\n      thousand years. Cathedrals are there, and a Creed (or memory of a\r\n      Creed) in them; Palaces, and a State and Law. Thou seest the\r\n      Smoke-vapour; _un_extinguished Breath as of a thing living.\r\n      Labour’s thousand hammers ring on her anvils: also a more\r\n      miraculous Labour works noiselessly, not with the Hand but with\r\n      the Thought. How have cunning workmen in all crafts, with their\r\n      cunning head and right-hand, tamed the Four Elements to be their\r\n      ministers; yoking the winds to their Sea-chariot, making the very\r\n      Stars their Nautical Timepiece;—and written and collected a\r\n      _Bibliothèque du Roi;_ among whose Books is the Hebrew Book! A\r\n      wondrous race of creatures: _these_ have been realised, and what\r\n      of Skill is in these: call not the Past Time, with all its\r\n      confused wretchednesses, a lost one.\r\n\r\n      Observe, however, that of man’s whole terrestrial possessions and\r\n      attainments, unspeakably the noblest are his Symbols, divine or\r\n      divine-seeming; under which he marches and fights, with\r\n      victorious assurance, in this life-battle: what we can call his\r\n      Realised Ideals. Of which realised ideals, omitting the rest,\r\n      consider only these two: his Church, or spiritual Guidance; his\r\n      Kingship, or temporal one. The Church: what a word was there;\r\n      richer than Golconda and the treasures of the world! In the heart\r\n      of the remotest mountains rises the little Kirk; the Dead all\r\n      slumbering round it, under their white memorial-stones, “in hope\r\n      of a happy resurrection:”—dull wert thou, O Reader, if never in\r\n      any hour (say of moaning midnight, when such Kirk hung spectral\r\n      in the sky, and Being was as if swallowed up of Darkness) it\r\n      spoke to thee—things unspeakable, that went into thy soul’s soul.\r\n      Strong was he that had a Church, what we can call a Church: he\r\n      stood thereby, though “in the centre of Immensities, in the\r\n      conflux of Eternities,” yet manlike towards God and man; the\r\n      vague shoreless Universe had become for him a firm city, and\r\n      dwelling which he knew. Such virtue was in Belief; in these\r\n      words, well spoken: _I believe_. Well might men prize their\r\n      _Credo_, and raise stateliest Temples for it, and reverend\r\n      Hierarchies, and give it the tithe of their substance; it was\r\n      worth living for and dying for.\r\n\r\n      Neither was that an inconsiderable moment when wild armed men\r\n      first raised their Strongest aloft on the buckler-throne, and\r\n      with clanging armour and hearts, said solemnly: Be thou our\r\n      Acknowledged Strongest! In such Acknowledged Strongest (well\r\n      named King, _Kön-ning,_ Can-ning, or Man that was Able) what a\r\n      Symbol shone now for them,—significant with the destinies of the\r\n      world! A Symbol of true Guidance in return for loving Obedience;\r\n      properly, if he knew it, the prime want of man. A Symbol which\r\n      might be called sacred; for is there not, in reverence for what\r\n      is better than we, an indestructible sacredness? On which ground,\r\n      too, it was well said there lay in the Acknowledged Strongest a\r\n      divine right; as surely there might in the Strongest, whether\r\n      Acknowledged or not,—considering _who_ it was that made him\r\n      strong. And so, in the midst of confusions and unutterable\r\n      incongruities (as all growth is confused), did this of Royalty,\r\n      with Loyalty environing it, spring up; and grow mysteriously,\r\n      subduing and assimilating (for a principle of Life was in it);\r\n      till it also had grown world-great, and was among the main Facts\r\n      of our modern existence. Such a Fact, that Louis XIV., for\r\n      example, could answer the expostulatory Magistrate with his\r\n      ‘_L’Etat c’est moi_ (The State? I am the State);’ and be replied\r\n      to by silence and abashed looks. So far had accident and\r\n      forethought; had your Louis Elevenths, with the leaden Virgin in\r\n      their hatband, and torture-wheels and conical _oubliettes_\r\n      (man-eating!) under their feet; your Henri Fourths, with their\r\n      prophesied social millennium, “when every peasant should have his\r\n      fowl in the pot;” and on the whole, the fertility of this most\r\n      fertile Existence (named of Good and Evil),—brought it, in the\r\n      matter of the Kingship. Wondrous! Concerning which may we not\r\n      again say, that in the huge mass of Evil, as it rolls and swells,\r\n      there is ever some Good working imprisoned; working towards\r\n      deliverance and triumph?\r\n\r\n      How such Ideals do realise themselves; and grow, wondrously, from\r\n      amid the incongruous ever-fluctuating chaos of the Actual: this\r\n      is what World-History, if it teach any thing, has to teach us,\r\n      How they grow; and, after long stormy growth, bloom out mature,\r\n      supreme; then quickly (for the blossom is brief) fall into decay;\r\n      sorrowfully dwindle; and crumble down, or rush down, noisily or\r\n      noiselessly disappearing. The blossom is so brief; as of some\r\n      centennial Cactus-flower, which after a century of waiting shines\r\n      out for hours! Thus from the day when rough Clovis, in the Champ\r\n      de Mars, in sight of his whole army, had to cleave retributively\r\n      the head of that rough Frank, with sudden battleaxe, and the\r\n      fierce words, ‘It was thus thou clavest the vase’ (St. Remi’s and\r\n      mine) ‘at Soissons,’ forward to Louis the Grand and his _L’Etat\r\n      c’est moi_, we count some twelve hundred years: and now this the\r\n      very next Louis is dying, and so much dying with him!—Nay, thus\r\n      too, if Catholicism, with and against Feudalism (but _not_\r\n      against Nature and her bounty), gave us English a Shakspeare and\r\n      Era of Shakspeare, and so produced a blossom of Catholicism—it\r\n      was not till Catholicism itself, so far as Law could abolish it,\r\n      had been abolished here.\r\n\r\n      But of those decadent ages in which no Ideal either grows or\r\n      blossoms? When Belief and Loyalty have passed away, and only the\r\n      cant and false echo of them remains; and all Solemnity has become\r\n      Pageantry; and the Creed of persons in authority has become one\r\n      of two things: an Imbecility or a Macchiavelism? Alas, of these\r\n      ages World-History can take no notice; they have to become\r\n      compressed more and more, and finally suppressed in the Annals of\r\n      Mankind; blotted out as spurious,—which indeed they are. Hapless\r\n      ages: wherein, if ever in any, it is an unhappiness to be born.\r\n      To be born, and to learn only, by every tradition and example,\r\n      that God’s Universe is Belial’s and a Lie; and “the Supreme\r\n      Quack” the hierarch of men! In which mournfulest faith,\r\n      nevertheless, do we not see whole generations (two, and sometimes\r\n      even three successively) live, what they call living; and\r\n      vanish,—without chance of reappearance?\r\n\r\n      In such a decadent age, or one fast verging that way, had our\r\n      poor Louis been born. Grant also that if the French Kingship had\r\n      not, by course of Nature, long to live, he of all men was the man\r\n      to accelerate Nature. The Blossom of French Royalty, cactus-like,\r\n      has accordingly made an astonishing progress. In those Metz days,\r\n      it was still standing with all its petals, though bedimmed by\r\n      Orleans Regents and _Roué_ Ministers and Cardinals; but now, in\r\n      1774, we behold it bald, and the virtue nigh gone out of it.\r\n\r\n      Disastrous indeed does it look with those same “realised ideals,”\r\n      one and all! The Church, which in its palmy season, seven hundred\r\n      years ago, could make an Emperor wait barefoot, in penance-shift;\r\n      three days, in the snow, has for centuries seen itself decaying;\r\n      reduced even to forget old purposes and enmities, and join\r\n      interest with the Kingship: on this younger strength it would\r\n      fain stay its decrepitude; and these two will henceforth stand\r\n      and fall together. Alas, the Sorbonne still sits there, in its\r\n      old mansion; but mumbles only jargon of dotage, and no longer\r\n      leads the consciences of men: not the Sorbonne; it is\r\n      _Encyclopédies, Philosophie_, and who knows what nameless\r\n      innumerable multitude of ready Writers, profane Singers,\r\n      Romancers, Players, Disputators, and Pamphleteers, that now form\r\n      the Spiritual Guidance of the world. The world’s Practical\r\n      Guidance too is lost, or has glided into the same miscellaneous\r\n      hands. Who is it that the King (_Able-man_, named also _Roi,\r\n      Rex,_ or Director) now guides? His own huntsmen and prickers:\r\n      when there is to be no hunt, it is well said, “_Le Roi ne fera\r\n      rien_ (Today his Majesty will do _nothing_).”[7] He lives and\r\n      lingers there, because he is living there, and none has yet laid\r\n      hands on him.\r\n\r\n      The nobles, in like manner, have nearly ceased either to guide or\r\n      misguide; and are now, as their master is, little more than\r\n      ornamental figures. It is long since they have done with\r\n      butchering one another or their king: the Workers, protected,\r\n      encouraged by Majesty, have ages ago built walled towns, and\r\n      there ply their crafts; will permit no Robber Baron to “live by\r\n      the saddle,” but maintain a gallows to prevent it. Ever since\r\n      that period of the _Fronde_, the Noble has changed his fighting\r\n      sword into a court rapier, and now loyally attends his king as\r\n      ministering satellite; divides the spoil, not now by violence and\r\n      murder, but by soliciting and finesse. These men call themselves\r\n      supports of the throne, singular gilt-pasteboard _caryatides_ in\r\n      that singular edifice! For the rest, their privileges every way\r\n      are now much curtailed. That law authorizing a Seigneur, as he\r\n      returned from hunting, to kill not more than two Serfs, and\r\n      refresh his feet in their warm blood and bowels, has fallen into\r\n      perfect desuetude,—and even into incredibility; for if Deputy\r\n      Lapoule can believe in it, and call for the abrogation of it, so\r\n      cannot we.[8] No Charolois, for these last fifty years, though\r\n      never so fond of shooting, has been in use to bring down slaters\r\n      and plumbers, and see them roll from their roofs;[9] but contents\r\n      himself with partridges and grouse. Close-viewed, their industry\r\n      and function is that of dressing gracefully and eating\r\n      sumptuously. As for their debauchery and depravity, it is perhaps\r\n      unexampled since the era of Tiberius and Commodus. Nevertheless,\r\n      one has still partly a feeling with the lady Maréchale: ‘Depend\r\n      upon it, Sir, God thinks twice before damning a man of that\r\n      quality.’[10] These people, of old, surely had virtues, uses; or\r\n      they could not have been there. Nay, one virtue they are still\r\n      required to have (for mortal man cannot live without a\r\n      conscience): the virtue of perfect readiness to fight duels.\r\n\r\n      Such are the shepherds of the people: and now how fares it with\r\n      the flock? With the flock, as is inevitable, it fares ill, and\r\n      ever worse. They are not tended, they are only regularly shorn.\r\n      They are sent for, to do statute-labour, to pay statute-taxes; to\r\n      fatten battle-fields (named “Bed of honour”) with their bodies,\r\n      in quarrels which are not theirs; their hand and toil is in every\r\n      possession of man; but for themselves they have little or no\r\n      possession. Untaught, uncomforted, unfed; to pine dully in thick\r\n      obscuration, in squalid destitution and obstruction: this is the\r\n      lot of the millions; _peuple taillable et corvéable à merci et\r\n      miséricorde_. In Brittany they once rose in revolt at the first\r\n      introduction of Pendulum Clocks; thinking it had something to do\r\n      with the _Gabelle_. Paris requires to be cleared out periodically\r\n      by the Police; and the horde of hunger-stricken vagabonds to be\r\n      sent wandering again over space—for a time. “During one such\r\n      periodical clearance,” says Lacretelle, “in May, 1750, the Police\r\n      had presumed withal to carry off some reputable people’s\r\n      children, in the hope of extorting ransoms for them. The mothers\r\n      fill the public places with cries of despair; crowds gather, get\r\n      excited: so many women in destraction run about exaggerating the\r\n      alarm: an absurd and horrid fable arises among the people; it is\r\n      said that the doctors have ordered a Great Person to take baths\r\n      of young human blood for the restoration of his own, all spoiled\r\n      by debaucheries. Some of the rioters,” adds Lacretelle, quite\r\n      coolly, “were hanged on the following days:” the Police went\r\n      on.[11] O ye poor naked wretches! and this, then, is your\r\n      inarticulate cry to Heaven, as of a dumb tortured animal, crying\r\n      from uttermost depths of pain and debasement? Do these azure\r\n      skies, like a dead crystalline vault, only reverberate the echo\r\n      of it on you? Respond to it only by “hanging on the following\r\n      days?”—Not so: not forever! Ye are heard in Heaven. And the\r\n      answer too will come,—in a horror of great darkness, and shakings\r\n      of the world, and a cup of trembling which all the nations shall\r\n      drink.\r\n\r\n      Remark, meanwhile, how from amid the wrecks and dust of this\r\n      universal Decay new Powers are fashioning themselves, adapted to\r\n      the new time and its destinies. Besides the old Noblesse,\r\n      originally of Fighters, there is a new recognised Noblesse of\r\n      Lawyers; whose gala-day and proud battle-day even now is. An\r\n      unrecognised Noblesse of Commerce; powerful enough, with money in\r\n      its pocket. Lastly, powerfulest of all, least recognised of all,\r\n      a Noblesse of Literature; without steel on their thigh, without\r\n      gold in their purse, but with the “grand thaumaturgic faculty of\r\n      Thought” in their head. French Philosophism has arisen; in which\r\n      little word how much do we include! Here, indeed, lies properly\r\n      the cardinal symptom of the whole wide-spread malady. Faith is\r\n      gone out; Scepticism is come in. Evil abounds and accumulates: no\r\n      man has Faith to withstand it, to amend it, to begin by amending\r\n      himself; it must even go on accumulating. While hollow langour\r\n      and vacuity is the lot of the Upper, and want and stagnation of\r\n      the Lower, and universal misery is very certain, what other thing\r\n      is certain? That a Lie cannot be believed! Philosophism knows\r\n      only this: her other belief is mainly that, in spiritual\r\n      supersensual matters no Belief is possible. Unhappy! Nay, as yet\r\n      the Contradiction of a Lie is some kind of Belief; but the Lie\r\n      with its Contradiction once swept away, what will remain? The\r\n      five unsatiated Senses will remain, the sixth insatiable Sense\r\n      (of vanity); the whole _dæmonic_ nature of man will\r\n      remain,—hurled forth to rage blindly without rule or rein; savage\r\n      itself, yet with all the tools and weapons of civilisation; a\r\n      spectacle new in History.\r\n\r\n      In such a France, as in a Powder-tower, where fire unquenched and\r\n      now unquenchable is smoking and smouldering all round, has Louis\r\n      XV. lain down to die. With Pompadourism and Dubarryism, his\r\n      Fleur-de-lis has been shamefully struck down in all lands and on\r\n      all seas; Poverty invades even the Royal Exchequer, and\r\n      Tax-farming can squeeze out no more; there is a quarrel of\r\n      twenty-five years’ standing with the Parlement; everywhere Want,\r\n      Dishonesty, Unbelief, and hotbrained Sciolists for\r\n      state-physicians: it is a portentous hour.\r\n\r\n      Such things can the eye of History see in this sick-room of King\r\n      Louis, which were invisible to the Courtiers there. It is twenty\r\n      years, gone Christmas-day, since Lord Chesterfield, summing up\r\n      what he had noted of this same France, wrote, and sent off by\r\n      post, the following words, that have become memorable: “In short,\r\n      all the symptoms which I have ever met with in History, previous\r\n      to great Changes and Revolutions in government, now exist and\r\n      daily increase in France.”[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.1.III.\r\n      Viaticum.\r\n\r\n      For the present, however, the grand question with the Governors\r\n      of France is: Shall extreme unction, or other ghostly viaticum\r\n      (to Louis, not to France), be administered?\r\n\r\n      It is a deep question. For, if administered, if so much as spoken\r\n      of, must not, on the very threshold of the business, Witch\r\n      Dubarry vanish; hardly to return should Louis even recover? With\r\n      her vanishes Duke d’Aiguillon and Company, and all their\r\n      Armida-Palace, as was said; Chaos swallows the whole again, and\r\n      there is left nothing but a smell of brimstone. But then, on the\r\n      other hand, what will the Dauphinists and Choiseulists say? Nay\r\n      what may the royal martyr himself say, should he happen to get\r\n      deadly worse, without getting delirious? For the present, he\r\n      still kisses the Dubarry hand; so we, from the ante-room, can\r\n      note: but afterwards? Doctors’ bulletins may run as they are\r\n      ordered, but it is “confluent small-pox,”—of which, as is\r\n      whispered too, the Gatekeeper’s once so buxom Daughter lies ill:\r\n      and Louis XV. is not a man to be trifled with in his viaticum.\r\n      Was he not wont to catechise his very girls in the\r\n      _Parc-aux-cerfs_, and pray with and for them, that they might\r\n      preserve their—orthodoxy?[13] A strange fact, not an unexampled\r\n      one; for there is no animal so strange as man.\r\n\r\n      For the moment, indeed, it were all well, could Archbishop\r\n      Beaumont but be prevailed upon—to wink with one eye! Alas,\r\n      Beaumont would himself so fain do it: for, singular to tell, the\r\n      Church too, and whole posthumous hope of Jesuitism, now hangs by\r\n      the apron of this same unmentionable woman. But then “the force\r\n      of public opinion”? Rigorous Christophe de Beaumont, who has\r\n      spent his life in persecuting hysterical Jansenists and\r\n      incredulous Non-confessors; or even their dead bodies, if no\r\n      better might be,—how shall he now open Heaven’s gate, and give\r\n      Absolution with the _corpus delicti_ still under his nose? Our\r\n      Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon, for his part, will not higgle with a\r\n      royal sinner about turning of the key: but there are other\r\n      Churchmen; there is a King’s Confessor, foolish Abbé Moudon; and\r\n      Fanaticism and Decency are not yet extinct. On the whole, what is\r\n      to be done? The doors can be well watched; the Medical Bulletin\r\n      adjusted; and much, as usual, be hoped for from time and chance.\r\n\r\n      The doors are well watched, no improper figure can enter. Indeed,\r\n      few wish to enter; for the putrid infection reaches even to the\r\n      _Œil-de-Bœuf;_ so that “more than fifty fall sick, and ten die.”\r\n      Mesdames the Princesses alone wait at the loathsome sick-bed;\r\n      impelled by filial piety. The three Princesses, _Graille, Chiffe,\r\n      Coche_ (Rag, Snip, Pig, as he was wont to name them), are\r\n      assiduous there; when all have fled. The fourth Princess _Loque_\r\n      (Dud), as we guess, is already in the Nunnery, and can only give\r\n      her orisons. Poor _Graille_ and Sisterhood, they have never known\r\n      a Father: such is the hard bargain Grandeur must make. Scarcely\r\n      at the _Débotter_ (when Royalty took off its boots) could they\r\n      snatch up their “enormous hoops, gird the long train round their\r\n      waists, huddle on their black cloaks of taffeta up to the very\r\n      chin;” and so, in fit appearance of full dress, “every evening at\r\n      six,” walk majestically in; receive their royal kiss on the brow;\r\n      and then walk majestically out again, to embroidery,\r\n      small-scandal, prayers, and vacancy. If Majesty came some\r\n      morning, with coffee of its own making, and swallowed it with\r\n      them hastily while the dogs were uncoupling for the hunt, it was\r\n      received as a grace of Heaven.[14] Poor withered ancient women!\r\n      in the wild tossings that yet await your fragile existence,\r\n      before it be crushed and broken; as ye fly through hostile\r\n      countries, over tempestuous seas, are almost taken by the Turks;\r\n      and wholly, in the Sansculottic Earthquake, know not your right\r\n      hand from your left, be this always an assured place in your\r\n      remembrance: for the act was good and loving! To us also it is a\r\n      little sunny spot, in that dismal howling waste, where we hardly\r\n      find another.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, what shall an impartial prudent Courtier do? In these\r\n      delicate circumstances, while not only death or life, but even\r\n      sacrament or no sacrament, is a question, the skilfulest may\r\n      falter. Few are so happy as the Duke d’Orléans and the Prince de\r\n      Condé; who can themselves, with volatile salts, attend the King’s\r\n      ante-chamber; and, at the same time, send their brave sons (Duke\r\n      de Chartres, _Egalité_ that is to be; Duke de Bourbon, one day\r\n      Condé too, and famous among Dotards) to wait upon the Dauphin.\r\n      With another few, it is a resolution taken; _jacta est alea_. Old\r\n      Richelieu,—when Beaumont, driven by public opinion, is at last\r\n      for entering the sick-room,—will twitch him by the rochet, into a\r\n      recess; and there, with his old dissipated mastiff-face, and the\r\n      oiliest vehemence, be seen pleading (and even, as we judge by\r\n      Beaumont’s change of colour, prevailing) “that the King be not\r\n      killed by a proposition in Divinity.” Duke de Fronsac, son of\r\n      Richelieu, can follow his father: when the Curé of Versailles\r\n      whimpers something about sacraments, he will threaten to “throw\r\n      him out of the window if he mention such a thing.”\r\n\r\n      Happy these, we may say; but to the rest that hover between two\r\n      opinions, is it not trying? He who would understand to what a\r\n      pass Catholicism, and much else, had now got; and how the symbols\r\n      of the Holiest have become gambling-dice of the Basest,—must read\r\n      the narrative of those things by Besenval, and Soulavie, and the\r\n      other Court Newsmen of the time. He will see the Versailles\r\n      Galaxy all scattered asunder, grouped into new ever-shifting\r\n      Constellations. There are nods and sagacious glances;\r\n      go-betweens, silk dowagers mysteriously gliding, with smiles for\r\n      this constellation, sighs for that: there is tremor, of hope or\r\n      desperation, in several hearts. There is the pale grinning Shadow\r\n      of Death, ceremoniously ushered along by another grinning Shadow,\r\n      of Etiquette: at intervals the growl of Chapel Organs, like\r\n      prayer by machinery; proclaiming, as in a kind of horrid diabolic\r\n      horse-laughter, _Vanity of vanities, all is Vanity!_\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.1.IV.\r\n      Louis the Unforgotten.\r\n\r\n      Poor Louis! With these it is a hollow phantasmagory, where like\r\n      mimes they mope and mowl, and utter false sounds for hire; but\r\n      with thee it is frightful earnest.\r\n\r\n      Frightful to all men is Death; from of old named King of Terrors.\r\n      Our little compact home of an Existence, where we dwelt\r\n      complaining, yet as in a home, is passing, in dark agonies, into\r\n      an Unknown of Separation, Foreignness, unconditioned Possibility.\r\n      The Heathen Emperor asks of his soul: Into what places art thou\r\n      now departing? The Catholic King must answer: To the Judgment-bar\r\n      of the Most High God! Yes, it is a summing-up of Life; a final\r\n      settling, and giving-in the “account of the deeds done in the\r\n      body:” they are done now; and lie there unalterable, and do bear\r\n      their fruits, long as Eternity shall last.\r\n\r\n      Louis XV. had always the kingliest abhorrence of Death. Unlike\r\n      that praying Duke of Orleans, _Egalité’s_ grandfather,—for indeed\r\n      several of them had a touch of madness,—who honesty believed that\r\n      there was no Death! He, if the Court Newsmen can be believed,\r\n      started up once on a time, glowing with sulphurous contempt and\r\n      indignation on his poor Secretary, who had stumbled on the words,\r\n      _feu roi d’Espagne_ (the late King of Spain): ‘_Feu roi,\r\n      Monsieur?_’—‘_Monseigneur_,’ hastily answered the trembling but\r\n      adroit man of business, ‘_c’est une titre qu’ils prennent_ (’tis\r\n      a title they take).’[15] Louis, we say, was not so happy; but he\r\n      did what he could. He would not suffer Death to be spoken of;\r\n      avoided the sight of churchyards, funereal monuments, and\r\n      whatsoever could bring it to mind. It is the resource of the\r\n      Ostrich; who, hard hunted, sticks his foolish head in the ground,\r\n      and would fain forget that his foolish unseeing body is not\r\n      unseen too. Or sometimes, with a spasmodic antagonism,\r\n      significant of the same thing, and of more, he _would_ go; or\r\n      stopping his court carriages, would send into churchyards, and\r\n      ask “how many new graves there were today,” though it gave his\r\n      poor Pompadour the disagreeablest qualms. We can figure the\r\n      thought of Louis that day, when, all royally caparisoned for\r\n      hunting, he met, at some sudden turning in the Wood of Senart, a\r\n      ragged Peasant with a coffin: ‘For whom?’—It was for a poor\r\n      brother slave, whom Majesty had sometimes noticed slaving in\r\n      those quarters. ‘What did he die of?’—‘Of hunger:’—the King gave\r\n      his steed the spur.[16]\r\n\r\n      But figure his thought, when Death is now clutching at his own\r\n      heart-strings, unlooked for, inexorable! Yes, poor Louis, Death\r\n      has found thee. No palace walls or life-guards, gorgeous\r\n      tapestries or gilt buckram of stiffest ceremonial could keep him\r\n      out; but he is here, here at thy very life-breath, and will\r\n      extinguish it. Thou, whose whole existence hitherto was a chimera\r\n      and scenic show, at length becomest a reality: sumptuous\r\n      Versailles bursts asunder, like a dream, into void Immensity;\r\n      Time is done, and all the scaffolding of Time falls wrecked with\r\n      hideous clangour round thy soul: the pale Kingdoms yawn open;\r\n      there must thou enter, naked, all unking’d, and await what is\r\n      appointed thee! Unhappy man, there as thou turnest, in dull\r\n      agony, on thy bed of weariness, what a thought is thine!\r\n      Purgatory and Hell-fire, now all-too possible, in the prospect;\r\n      in the retrospect,—alas, what thing didst thou do that were not\r\n      better undone; what mortal didst thou generously help; what\r\n      sorrow hadst thou mercy on? Do the “five hundred thousand”\r\n      ghosts, who sank shamefully on so many battle-fields from\r\n      Rossbach to Quebec, that thy Harlot might take revenge for an\r\n      epigram,—crowd round thee in this hour? Thy foul Harem; the\r\n      curses of mothers, the tears and infamy of daughters? Miserable\r\n      man! thou “hast done evil as thou couldst:” thy whole existence\r\n      seems one hideous abortion and mistake of Nature; the use and\r\n      meaning of thee not yet known. Wert thou a fabulous Griffin,\r\n      _devouring_ the works of men; daily dragging virgins to thy\r\n      cave;—clad also in scales that no spear would pierce: no spear\r\n      but Death’s? A Griffin not fabulous but real! Frightful, O Louis,\r\n      seem these moments for thee.—We will pry no further into the\r\n      horrors of a sinner’s death-bed.\r\n\r\n      And yet let no meanest man lay flattering unction to his soul.\r\n      Louis was a Ruler; but art not thou also one? His wide France,\r\n      look at it from the Fixed Stars (themselves not yet Infinitude),\r\n      is no wider than thy narrow brickfield, where thou too didst\r\n      faithfully, or didst unfaithfully. Man, “Symbol of Eternity\r\n      imprisoned into Time!” it is not thy works, which are all mortal,\r\n      infinitely little, and the greatest no greater than the least,\r\n      but only the Spirit thou workest in, that can have worth or\r\n      continuance.\r\n\r\n      But reflect, in any case, what a life-problem this of poor Louis,\r\n      when he rose as _Bien-Aimé_ from that Metz sick-bed, really was!\r\n      What son of Adam could have swayed such incoherences into\r\n      coherence? Could he? Blindest Fortune alone has cast _him_ on the\r\n      top of it: he swims there; can as little sway it as the drift-log\r\n      sways the wind-tossed moon-stirred Atlantic. ‘What have I done to\r\n      be so loved?’ he said then. He may say now: What have I done to\r\n      be so hated? Thou hast done nothing, poor Louis! Thy fault is\r\n      properly even this, that thou didst _nothing_. What could poor\r\n      Louis do? Abdicate, and wash his hands of it,—in favour of the\r\n      first that would accept! Other clear wisdom there was none for\r\n      him. As it was, he stood gazing dubiously, the absurdest mortal\r\n      extant (a very Solecism Incarnate), into the absurdest confused\r\n      world;—wherein at lost nothing seemed so certain as that he, the\r\n      incarnate Solecism, had five senses; that were Flying Tables\r\n      (_Tables Volantes_, which vanish through the floor, to come back\r\n      reloaded). and a _Parc-aux-cerfs_.\r\n\r\n      Whereby at least we have again this historical curiosity: a human\r\n      being in an original position; swimming passively, as on some\r\n      boundless “Mother of Dead Dogs,” towards issues which he partly\r\n      saw. For Louis had withal a kind of insight in him. So, when a\r\n      new Minister of Marine, or what else it might be, came announcing\r\n      his new era, the Scarlet-woman would hear from the lips of\r\n      Majesty at supper: ‘Yes, he spread out his ware like another;\r\n      promised the beautifulest things in the world; not a thing of\r\n      which will come: he does not know this region; he will see.’ Or\r\n      again: ‘’Tis the twentieth time I hear all that; France will\r\n      never get a Navy, I believe.’ How touching also was this: ‘If _I_\r\n      were Lieutenant of Police, I would prohibit those Paris\r\n      cabriolets.’[17]\r\n\r\n      Doomed mortal;—for is it not a doom to be Solecism incarnate! A\r\n      new _Roi Fainéant_, King Donothing; but with the strangest new\r\n      _Mayor of the Palace:_ no bow-legged Pepin now for _Mayor_, but\r\n      that same cloud-capt, fire-breathing Spectre of DEMOCRACY;\r\n      incalculable, which is enveloping the world!—Was Louis no\r\n      wickeder than this or the other private Donothing and Eatall;\r\n      such as we often enough see, under the name of Man, and even Man\r\n      of Pleasure, cumbering God’s diligent Creation, for a time? Say,\r\n      wretcheder! His Life-solecism was seen and felt of a whole\r\n      scandalised world; him endless Oblivion cannot engulf, and\r\n      swallow to endless depths,—not yet for a generation or two.\r\n\r\n      However, be this as it will, we remark, not without interest,\r\n      that “on the evening of the 4th,” Dame Dubarry issues from the\r\n      sick-room, with perceptible “trouble in her visage.” It is the\r\n      fourth evening of May, year of Grace 1774. Such a whispering in\r\n      the Œil-de-Bœuf! Is he dying then? What can be said is, that\r\n      Dubarry seems making up her packages; she sails weeping through\r\n      her gilt boudoirs, as if taking leave. D’Aiguilon and Company are\r\n      near their last card; nevertheless they will not yet throw up the\r\n      game. But as for the sacramental controversy, it is as good as\r\n      settled without being mentioned; Louis can send for his Abbé\r\n      Moudon in the course of next night, be confessed by him, some say\r\n      for the space of “seventeen minutes,” and demand the sacraments\r\n      of his own accord.\r\n\r\n      Nay, already, in the afternoon, behold is not this your Sorceress\r\n      Dubarry with the handkerchief at her eyes, mounting D’Aiguillon’s\r\n      chariot; rolling off in his Duchess’s consolatory arms? She is\r\n      gone; and her place knows her no more. Vanish, false Sorceress;\r\n      into Space! Needless to hover at neighbouring Ruel; for thy day\r\n      is done. Shut are the royal palace-gates for evermore; hardly in\r\n      coming years shalt thou, under cloud of night, descend once, in\r\n      black domino, like a black night-bird, and disturb the fair\r\n      Antoinette’s music-party in the Park: all Birds of Paradise\r\n      flying from thee, and musical windpipes growing mute.[18] Thou\r\n      unclean, yet unmalignant, not unpitiable thing! What a course was\r\n      thine: from that first trucklebed (in Joan of Arc’s country)\r\n      where thy mother bore thee, with tears, to an unnamed father:\r\n      forward, through lowest subterranean depths, and over highest\r\n      sunlit heights, of Harlotdom and Rascaldom—to the guillotine-axe,\r\n      which shears away thy vainly whimpering head! Rest there\r\n      uncursed; only buried and abolished: what else befitted thee?\r\n\r\n      Louis, meanwhile, is in considerable impatience for his\r\n      sacraments; sends more than once to the window, to see whether\r\n      they are not coming. Be of comfort, Louis, what comfort thou\r\n      canst: they are under way, those sacraments. Towards six in the\r\n      morning, they arrive. Cardinal Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon is here,\r\n      in pontificals, with his pyxes and his tools; he approaches the\r\n      royal pillow; elevates his wafer; mutters or seems to mutter\r\n      somewhat;—and so (as the Abbé Georgel, in words that stick to\r\n      one, expresses it) has Louis “made the _amende honorable_ to\r\n      God;” so does your Jesuit construe it.—‘_Wa, Wa_,’ as the wild\r\n      Clotaire groaned out, when life was departing, ‘what great God is\r\n      this that pulls down the strength of the strongest kings!’[19]\r\n\r\n      The _amende honorable_, what “legal apology” you will, to\r\n      God:—but not, if D’Aiguillon can help it, to man. Dubarry still\r\n      hovers in his mansion at Ruel; and while there is life, there is\r\n      hope. Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon, accordingly (for he seems to be\r\n      in the secret), has no sooner seen his pyxes and gear repacked,\r\n      then he is stepping majestically forth again, as if the work were\r\n      done! But King’s Confessor Abbé Moudon starts forward; with\r\n      anxious acidulent face, twitches him by the sleeve; whispers in\r\n      his ear. Whereupon the poor Cardinal must turn round; and declare\r\n      audibly; ‘That his Majesty repents of any subjects of scandal he\r\n      may have given (_a pu donner_); and purposes, by the strength of\r\n      Heaven assisting him, to avoid the like—for the future!’ Words\r\n      listened to by Richelieu with mastiff-face, growing blacker;\r\n      answered to, aloud, “with an epithet,”—which Besenval will not\r\n      repeat. Old Richelieu, conqueror of Minorca, companion of\r\n      Flying-Table orgies, perforator of bedroom walls,[20] is thy day\r\n      also done?\r\n\r\n      Alas, the Chapel organs may keep going; the Shrine of Sainte\r\n      Genevieve be let down, and pulled up again,—without effect. In\r\n      the evening the whole Court, with Dauphin and Dauphiness, assist\r\n      at the Chapel: priests are hoarse with chanting their “Prayers of\r\n      Forty Hours;” and the heaving bellows blow. Almost frightful! For\r\n      the very heaven blackens; battering rain-torrents dash, with\r\n      thunder; almost drowning the organ’s voice: and electric\r\n      fire-flashes make the very flambeaux on the altar pale. So that\r\n      the most, as we are told, retired, when it was over, with hurried\r\n      steps, “in a state of meditation (_recueillement_),” and said\r\n      little or nothing.[21]\r\n\r\n      So it has lasted for the better half of a fortnight; the Dubarry\r\n      gone almost a week. Besenval says, all the world was getting\r\n      impatient _que cela finît;_ that poor Louis would have done with\r\n      it. It is now the 10th of May 1774. He will soon have done now.\r\n\r\n      This tenth May day falls into the loathsome sick-bed; but dull,\r\n      unnoticed there: for they that look out of the windows are quite\r\n      darkened; the cistern-wheel moves discordant on its axis; Life,\r\n      like a spent steed, is panting towards the goal. In their remote\r\n      apartments, Dauphin and Dauphiness stand road-ready; all grooms\r\n      and equerries booted and spurred: waiting for some signal to\r\n      escape the house of pestilence.[22] And, hark! across the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf, what sound is that; sound “terrible and absolutely\r\n      like thunder”? It is the rush of the whole Court, rushing as in\r\n      wager, to salute the new Sovereigns: Hail to your Majesties! The\r\n      Dauphin and Dauphiness are King and Queen! Over-powered with many\r\n      emotions, they two fall on their knees together, and, with\r\n      streaming tears, exclaim, ‘O God, guide us, protect us; we are\r\n      too young to reign!’—Too young indeed.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in any case, “with a sound absolutely like thunder,” has\r\n      the Horologe of Time struck, and an old Era passed away. The\r\n      Louis that was, lies forsaken, a mass of abhorred clay; abandoned\r\n      “to some poor persons, and priests of the _Chapelle\r\n      Ardente_,”—who make haste to put him “in two lead coffins,\r\n      pouring in abundant spirits of wine.” The new Louis with his\r\n      Court is rolling towards Choisy, through the summer afternoon:\r\n      the royal tears still flow; but a word mispronounced by\r\n      Monseigneur d’Artois sets them all laughing, and they weep no\r\n      more. Light mortals, how ye walk your light life-minuet, over\r\n      bottomless abysses, divided from you by a film!\r\n\r\n      For the rest, the proper authorities felt that no Funeral could\r\n      be too unceremonious. Besenval himself thinks it was\r\n      unceremonious enough. Two carriages containing two noblemen of\r\n      the usher species, and a Versailles clerical person; some score\r\n      of mounted pages, some fifty palfreniers; these, with torches,\r\n      but not so much as in black, start from Versailles on the second\r\n      evening with their leaden bier. At a high trot they start; and\r\n      keep up that pace. For the jibes (_brocards_) of those Parisians,\r\n      who stand planted in two rows, all the way to St. Denis, and\r\n      “give vent to their pleasantry, the characteristic of the\r\n      nation,” do not tempt one to slacken. Towards midnight the vaults\r\n      of St. Denis receive their own; unwept by any eye of all these;\r\n      if not by poor _Loque_ his neglected Daughter’s, whose Nunnery is\r\n      hard by.\r\n\r\n      Him they crush down, and huddle under-ground, in this impatient\r\n      way; him and his era of sin and tyranny and shame; for behold a\r\n      New Era is come; the future all the brighter that the past was\r\n      base.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 1.II.\r\n      THE PAPER AGE\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.I.\r\n      Astræa Redux.\r\n\r\n      A paradoxical philosopher, carrying to the uttermost length that\r\n      aphorism of Montesquieu’s, “Happy the people whose annals are\r\n      tiresome,” has said, “Happy the people whose annals are vacant.”\r\n      In which saying, mad as it looks, may there not still be found\r\n      some grain of reason? For truly, as it has been written, “Silence\r\n      is divine,” and of Heaven; so in all earthly things too there is\r\n      a silence which is better than any speech. Consider it well, the\r\n      Event, the thing which can be spoken of and recorded, is it not,\r\n      in all cases, some disruption, some solution of continuity? Were\r\n      it even a glad Event, it involves change, involves loss (of\r\n      active Force); and so far, either in the past or in the present,\r\n      is an irregularity, a disease. Stillest perseverance were our\r\n      blessedness; not dislocation and alteration,—could they be\r\n      avoided.\r\n\r\n      The oak grows silently, in the forest, a thousand years; only in\r\n      the thousandth year, when the woodman arrives with his axe, is\r\n      there heard an echoing through the solitudes; and the oak\r\n      announces itself when, with a far-sounding crash, it _falls_. How\r\n      silent too was the planting of the acorn; scattered from the lap\r\n      of some wandering wind! Nay, when our oak flowered, or put on its\r\n      leaves (its glad Events), what shout of proclamation could there\r\n      be? Hardly from the most observant a word of recognition. These\r\n      things _befell_ not, they were slowly _done;_ not in an hour, but\r\n      through the flight of days: what was to be said of it? This hour\r\n      seemed altogether as the last was, as the next would be.\r\n\r\n      It is thus everywhere that foolish Rumour babbles not of what was\r\n      done, but of what was misdone or undone; and foolish History\r\n      (ever, more or less, the written epitomised synopsis of Rumour)\r\n      knows so little that were not as well unknown. Attila Invasions,\r\n      Walter-the-Penniless Crusades, Sicilian Vespers, Thirty-Years\r\n      Wars: mere sin and misery; not work, but hindrance of work! For\r\n      the Earth, all this while, was yearly green and yellow with her\r\n      kind harvests; the hand of the craftsman, the mind of the thinker\r\n      rested not: and so, after all, and in spite of all, we have this\r\n      so glorious high-domed blossoming World; concerning which, poor\r\n      History may well ask, with wonder, Whence _it_ came? She knows so\r\n      little of it, knows so much of what obstructed it, what would\r\n      have rendered it impossible. Such, nevertheless, by necessity or\r\n      foolish choice, is her rule and practice; whereby that paradox,\r\n      “Happy the people whose annals are vacant,” is not without its\r\n      true side.\r\n\r\n      And yet, what seems more pertinent to note here, there is a\r\n      stillness, not of unobstructed growth, but of passive inertness,\r\n      and symptom of imminent downfall. As victory is silent, so is\r\n      defeat. Of the opposing forces the weaker has resigned itself;\r\n      the stronger marches on, noiseless now, but rapid, inevitable:\r\n      the fall and overturn will not be noiseless. How all grows, and\r\n      has its period, even as the herbs of the fields, be it annual,\r\n      centennial, millennial! All grows and dies, each by its own\r\n      wondrous laws, in wondrous fashion of its own; spiritual things\r\n      most wondrously of all. Inscrutable, to the wisest, are these\r\n      latter; not to be prophesied of, or understood. If when the oak\r\n      stands proudliest flourishing to the eye, you know that its heart\r\n      is sound, it is not so with the man; how much less with the\r\n      Society, with the Nation of men! Of such it may be affirmed even\r\n      that the superficial aspect, that the inward feeling of full\r\n      health, is generally ominous. For indeed it is of apoplexy, so to\r\n      speak, and a plethoric lazy habit of body, that Churches,\r\n      Kingships, Social Institutions, oftenest die. Sad, when such\r\n      Institution plethorically says to itself, Take thy ease, thou\r\n      hast goods laid up;—like the fool of the Gospel, to whom it was\r\n      answered, Fool, _this night_ thy life shall be required of thee!\r\n\r\n      Is it the healthy peace, or the ominous unhealthy, that rests on\r\n      France, for these next Ten Years? Over which the Historian can\r\n      pass lightly, without call to linger: for as yet events are not,\r\n      much less performances. Time of sunniest stillness;—shall we call\r\n      it, what all men thought it, the new Age of Gold? Call it at\r\n      least, of Paper; which in many ways is the succedaneum of Gold.\r\n      Bank-paper, wherewith you can still buy when there is no gold\r\n      left; Book-paper, splendent with Theories, Philosophies,\r\n      Sensibilities,—beautiful art, not only of revealing Thought, but\r\n      also of so beautifully hiding from us the want of Thought! Paper\r\n      is made from the _rags_ of things that did once exist; there are\r\n      endless excellences in Paper.—What wisest Philosophe, in this\r\n      halcyon uneventful period, could prophesy that there was\r\n      approaching, big with darkness and confusion, the event of\r\n      events? Hope ushers in a Revolution,—as earthquakes are preceded\r\n      by bright weather. On the Fifth of May, fifteen years hence, old\r\n      Louis will not be sending for the Sacraments; but a new Louis,\r\n      his grandson, with the whole pomp of astonished intoxicated\r\n      France, will be opening the States-General.\r\n\r\n      Dubarrydom and its D’Aiguillons are gone forever. There is a\r\n      young, still docile, well-intentioned King; a young, beautiful\r\n      and bountiful, well-intentioned Queen; and with them all France,\r\n      as it were, become young. Maupeou and his Parlement have to\r\n      vanish into thick night; respectable Magistrates, not indifferent\r\n      to the Nation, were it only for having been opponents of the\r\n      Court, can descend unchained from their “steep rocks at Croe in\r\n      Combrailles” and elsewhere, and return singing praises: the old\r\n      Parlement of Paris resumes its functions. Instead of a profligate\r\n      bankrupt Abbé Terray, we have now, for Controller-General, a\r\n      virtuous philosophic Turgot, with a whole Reformed France in his\r\n      head. By whom whatsoever is wrong, in Finance or otherwise, will\r\n      be righted,—as far as possible. Is it not as if Wisdom herself\r\n      were henceforth to have seat and voice in the Council of Kings?\r\n      Turgot has taken office with the noblest plainness of speech to\r\n      that effect; been listened to with the noblest royal\r\n      trustfulness.[23] It is true, as King Louis objects, ‘They say he\r\n      never goes to mass;’ but liberal France likes him little worse\r\n      for that; liberal France answers, ‘The Abbé Terray always went.’\r\n      Philosophism sees, for the first time, a Philosophe (or even a\r\n      Philosopher) in office: she in all things will applausively\r\n      second him; neither will light old Maurepas obstruct, if he can\r\n      easily help it.\r\n\r\n      Then how “sweet” are the manners; vice “losing all its\r\n      deformity;” becoming _decent_ (as established things, making\r\n      regulations for themselves, do); becoming almost a kind of\r\n      “sweet” virtue! Intelligence so abounds; irradiated by wit and\r\n      the art of conversation. Philosophism sits joyful in her\r\n      glittering saloons, the dinner-guest of Opulence grown ingenuous,\r\n      the very nobles proud to sit by her; and preaches, lifted up over\r\n      all Bastilles, a coming millennium. From far Ferney, Patriarch\r\n      Voltaire gives sign: veterans Diderot, D’Alembert have lived to\r\n      see this day; these with their younger Marmontels, Morellets,\r\n      Chamforts, Raynals, make glad the spicy board of rich ministering\r\n      Dowager, of philosophic Farmer-General. O nights and suppers of\r\n      the gods! Of a truth, the long-demonstrated will now be done:\r\n      “the Age of Revolutions approaches” (as Jean Jacques wrote), but\r\n      then of happy blessed ones. Man awakens from his long\r\n      somnambulism; chases the Phantasms that beleagured and bewitched\r\n      him. Behold the new morning glittering down the eastern steeps;\r\n      fly, false Phantasms, from its shafts of light; let the Absurd\r\n      fly utterly forsaking this lower Earth for ever. It is Truth and\r\n      _Astræa Redux_ that (in the shape of Philosophism) henceforth\r\n      reign. For what imaginable purpose was man made, if not to be\r\n      “happy”? By victorious Analysis, and Progress of the Species,\r\n      happiness enough now awaits him. Kings can become philosophers;\r\n      or else philosophers Kings. Let but Society be once rightly\r\n      constituted,—by victorious Analysis. The stomach that is empty\r\n      shall be filled; the throat that is dry shall be wetted with\r\n      wine. Labour itself shall be all one as rest; not grievous, but\r\n      joyous. Wheatfields, one would think, cannot come to grow\r\n      untilled; no man made clayey, or made weary thereby;—unless\r\n      indeed machinery will do it? Gratuitous Tailors and Restaurateurs\r\n      may start up, at fit intervals, one as yet sees not how. But if\r\n      each will, according to rule of Benevolence, have a care for all,\r\n      then surely—no one will be uncared for. Nay, who knows but, by\r\n      sufficiently victorious Analysis, “human life may be indefinitely\r\n      lengthened,” and men get rid of Death, as they have already done\r\n      of the Devil? We shall then be happy in spite of Death and the\r\n      Devil.—So preaches magniloquent Philosophism her _Redeunt\r\n      Saturnia regna._\r\n\r\n      The prophetic song of Paris and its Philosophes is audible enough\r\n      in the Versailles Œil-de-Bœuf; and the Œil-de-Bœuf, intent\r\n      chiefly on nearer blessedness, can answer, at worst, with a\r\n      polite ‘Why not?’ Good old cheery Maurepas is too joyful a Prime\r\n      Minister to dash the world’s joy. Sufficient for the day be its\r\n      own evil. Cheery old man, he cuts his jokes, and hovers careless\r\n      along; his cloak well adjusted to the wind, if so be he may\r\n      please all persons. The simple young King, whom a Maurepas cannot\r\n      think of troubling with business, has retired into the interior\r\n      apartments; taciturn, irresolute; though with a sharpness of\r\n      temper at times: he, at length, determines on a little smithwork;\r\n      and so, in apprenticeship with a Sieur Gamain (whom one day he\r\n      shall have little cause to bless), is learning to make locks.[24]\r\n      It appears further, he understood Geography; and could read\r\n      English. Unhappy young King, his childlike trust in that foolish\r\n      old Maurepas deserved another return. But friend and foe, destiny\r\n      and himself have combined to do him hurt.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile the fair young Queen, in her halls of state, walks like\r\n      a goddess of Beauty, the cynosure of all eyes; as yet mingles not\r\n      with affairs; heeds not the future; least of all, dreads it.\r\n      Weber and Campan[25] have pictured her, there within the royal\r\n      tapestries, in bright boudoirs, baths, peignoirs, and the Grand\r\n      and Little Toilette; with a whole brilliant world waiting\r\n      obsequious on her glance: fair young daughter of Time, what\r\n      things has Time in store for thee! Like Earth’s brightest\r\n      Appearance, she moves gracefully, environed with the grandeur of\r\n      Earth: a reality, and yet a magic vision; for, behold, shall not\r\n      utter Darkness swallow it! The soft young heart adopts orphans,\r\n      portions meritorious maids, delights to succour the poor,—such\r\n      poor as come picturesquely in her way; and sets the fashion of\r\n      doing it; for as was said, Benevolence has now begun reigning. In\r\n      her Duchess de Polignac, in Princess de Lamballe, she enjoys\r\n      something almost like friendship; now too, after seven long\r\n      years, she has a child, and soon even a Dauphin, of her own; can\r\n      reckon herself, as Queens go, happy in a husband.\r\n\r\n      Events? The Grand events are but charitable Feasts of Morals\r\n      (_Fêtes des mœurs_), with their Prizes and Speeches; Poissarde\r\n      Processions to the Dauphin’s cradle; above all, Flirtations,\r\n      their rise, progress, decline and fall. There are Snow-statues\r\n      raised by the poor in hard winter to a Queen who has given them\r\n      fuel. There are masquerades, theatricals; beautifyings of little\r\n      Trianon, purchase and repair of St. Cloud; journeyings from the\r\n      summer Court-Elysium to the winter one. There are poutings and\r\n      grudgings from the Sardinian Sisters-in-law (for the Princes too\r\n      are wedded); little jealousies, which Court-Etiquette can\r\n      moderate. Wholly the lightest-hearted frivolous foam of\r\n      Existence; yet an artfully refined foam; pleasant were it not so\r\n      costly, like that which mantles on the wine of Champagne!\r\n\r\n      Monsieur, the King’s elder Brother, has set up for a kind of wit;\r\n      and leans towards the Philosophe side. Monseigneur d’Artois pulls\r\n      the mask from a fair impertinent; fights a duel in\r\n      consequence,—almost drawing blood.[26] He has breeches of a kind\r\n      new in this world;—a fabulous kind; “four tall lackeys,” says\r\n      Mercier, as if he had seen it, “hold him up in the air, that he\r\n      may fall into the garment without vestige of wrinkle; from which\r\n      rigorous encasement the same four, in the same way, and with more\r\n      effort, must deliver him at night.”[27] This last is he who now,\r\n      as a gray time-worn man, sits desolate at Grätz;[28] having\r\n      winded up his destiny with the Three Days. In such sort are poor\r\n      mortals swept and shovelled to and fro.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.II.\r\n      Petition in Hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\n      With the working people, again it is not so well. Unlucky! For\r\n      there are twenty to twenty-five millions of them. Whom, however,\r\n      we lump together into a kind of dim compendious unity, monstrous\r\n      but dim, far off, as the _canaille;_ or, more humanely, as “the\r\n      masses.” Masses, indeed: and yet, singular to say, if, with an\r\n      effort of imagination, thou follow them, over broad France, into\r\n      their clay hovels, into their garrets and hutches, the masses\r\n      consist all of units. Every unit of whom has his own heart and\r\n      sorrows; stands covered there with his own skin, and if you prick\r\n      him he will bleed. O purple Sovereignty, Holiness, Reverence;\r\n      thou, for example, Cardinal Grand-Almoner, with thy plush\r\n      covering of honour, who hast thy hands strengthened with\r\n      dignities and moneys, and art set on thy world watch-tower\r\n      solemnly, in sight of God, for such ends,—what a thought: that\r\n      every unit of these masses is a miraculous Man, even as thyself\r\n      art; struggling, with vision, or with blindness, for _his_\r\n      infinite Kingdom (this life which he has got, once only, in the\r\n      middle of Eternities); with a spark of the Divinity, what thou\r\n      callest an immortal soul, in him!\r\n\r\n      Dreary, languid do these struggle in their obscure remoteness;\r\n      their hearth cheerless, their diet thin. For them, in this world,\r\n      rises no Era of Hope; hardly now in the other,—if it be not hope\r\n      in the gloomy rest of Death, for their faith too is failing.\r\n      Untaught, uncomforted, unfed! A dumb generation; their voice only\r\n      an inarticulate cry: spokesman, in the King’s Council, in the\r\n      world’s forum, they have none that finds credence. At rare\r\n      intervals (as now, in 1775), they will fling down their hoes and\r\n      hammers; and, to the astonishment of thinking mankind,[29] flock\r\n      hither and thither, dangerous, aimless; get the length even of\r\n      Versailles. Turgot is altering the Corn-trade, abrogating the\r\n      absurdest Corn-laws; there is dearth, real, or were it even\r\n      “factitious;” an indubitable scarcity of bread. And so, on the\r\n      second day of May 1775, these waste multitudes do here, at\r\n      Versailles Château, in wide-spread wretchedness, in sallow faces,\r\n      squalor, winged raggedness, present, as in legible hieroglyphic\r\n      writing, their Petition of Grievances. The Château gates have to\r\n      be shut; but the King will appear on the balcony, and speak to\r\n      them. They have seen the King’s face; their Petition of\r\n      Grievances has been, if not read, looked at. For answer, two of\r\n      them are hanged, on a “new gallows forty feet high;” and the rest\r\n      driven back to their dens,—for a time.\r\n\r\n      Clearly a difficult “point” for Government, that of dealing with\r\n      these masses;—if indeed it be not rather the sole point and\r\n      problem of Government, and all other points mere accidental\r\n      crotchets, superficialities, and beatings of the wind! For let\r\n      Charter-Chests, Use and Wont, Law common and special say what\r\n      they will, the masses count to so many millions of units; made,\r\n      to all appearance, by God,—whose Earth this is declared to be.\r\n      Besides, the people are not without ferocity; they have sinews\r\n      and indignation. Do but look what holiday old Marquis Mirabeau,\r\n      the crabbed old friend of Men, looked on, in these same years,\r\n      from his lodging, at the Baths of Mont d’Or: “The savages\r\n      descending in torrents from the mountains; our people ordered not\r\n      to go out. The Curate in surplice and stole; Justice in its\r\n      peruke; Marechausee sabre in hand, guarding the place, till the\r\n      bagpipes can begin. The dance interrupted, in a quarter of an\r\n      hour, by battle; the cries, the squealings of children, of infirm\r\n      persons, and other assistants, tarring them on, as the rabble\r\n      does when dogs fight: frightful men, or rather frightful wild\r\n      animals, clad in jupes of coarse woollen, with large girdles of\r\n      leather studded with copper nails; of gigantic stature,\r\n      heightened by high wooden-clogs (_sabots_); rising on tiptoe to\r\n      see the fight; tramping time to it; rubbing their sides with\r\n      their elbows: their faces haggard (_figures hâves_), and covered\r\n      with their long greasy hair; the upper part of the visage waxing\r\n      pale, the lower distorting itself into the attempt at a cruel\r\n      laugh and a sort of ferocious impatience. And these people pay\r\n      the _taille!_ And you want further to take their salt from them!\r\n      And you know not what it is you are stripping barer, or as you\r\n      call it, governing; what by the spurt of your pen, in its cold\r\n      dastard indifference, you will fancy you can starve always with\r\n      impunity; always till the catastrophe come!—Ah Madame, such\r\n      Government by Blindman’s-buff, stumbling along too far, will end\r\n      in the General Overturn (_culbute générale_).”[30]\r\n\r\n      Undoubtedly a dark feature this in an Age of Gold,—Age, at least,\r\n      of Paper and Hope! Meanwhile, trouble us not with thy prophecies,\r\n      O croaking Friend of Men: ’tis long that we have heard such; and\r\n      still the old world keeps wagging, in its old way.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.III.\r\n      Questionable.\r\n\r\n      Or is this same Age of Hope itself but a simulacrum; as Hope too\r\n      often is? Cloud-vapour with rainbows painted on it, beautiful to\r\n      see, to sail towards,—which hovers over Niagara Falls? In that\r\n      case, victorious Analysis will have enough to do.\r\n\r\n      Alas, yes! a whole world to remake, if she could see it; work for\r\n      another than she! For all is wrong, and gone out of joint; the\r\n      inward spiritual, and the outward economical; head or heart,\r\n      there is no soundness in it. As indeed, evils of all sorts are\r\n      more or less of kin, and do usually go together: especially it is\r\n      an old truth, that wherever huge physical evil is, there, as the\r\n      parent and origin of it, has moral evil to a proportionate extent\r\n      been. Before those five-and-twenty labouring Millions, for\r\n      instance, could get that haggardness of face, which old Mirabeau\r\n      now looks on, in a Nation calling itself Christian, and calling\r\n      man the brother of man,—what unspeakable, nigh infinite\r\n      Dishonesty (of _seeming_ and not _being_) in all manner of\r\n      Rulers, and appointed Watchers, spiritual and temporal, must\r\n      there not, through long ages, have gone on accumulating! It will\r\n      accumulate: moreover, it will reach a head; for the first of all\r\n      Gospels is this, that a Lie cannot endure for ever.\r\n\r\n      In fact, if we pierce through that rosepink vapour of\r\n      Sentimentalism, Philanthropy, and Feasts of Morals, there lies\r\n      behind it one of the sorriest spectacles. You might ask, What\r\n      bonds that ever held a human society happily together, or held it\r\n      together at all, are in force here? It is an unbelieving people;\r\n      which has suppositions, hypotheses, and froth-systems of\r\n      victorious Analysis; and for _belief_ this mainly, that Pleasure\r\n      is pleasant. Hunger they have for all sweet things; and the law\r\n      of Hunger; but what other law? Within them, or over them,\r\n      properly none!\r\n\r\n      Their King has become a King Popinjay; with his Maurepas\r\n      Government, gyrating as the weather-cock does, blown about by\r\n      every wind. Above them they see no God; or they even do not look\r\n      above, except with astronomical glasses. The Church indeed still\r\n      is; but in the most submissive state; quite tamed by\r\n      Philosophism; in a singularly short time; for the hour was come.\r\n      Some twenty years ago, your Archbishop Beaumont would not even\r\n      let the poor Jansenists get buried: your Loménie Brienne (a\r\n      rising man, whom we shall meet with yet) could, in the name of\r\n      the Clergy, insist on having the Anti-protestant laws, which\r\n      condemn to death for preaching, “put in execution.”[31] And,\r\n      alas, now not so much as Baron Holbach’s Atheism can be\r\n      burnt,—except as pipe-matches by the private speculative\r\n      individual. Our Church stands haltered, dumb, like a dumb ox;\r\n      lowing only for provender (of tithes); content if it can have\r\n      that; or, dumbly, dully expecting its further doom. And the\r\n      Twenty Millions of “haggard faces;” and, as finger-post and\r\n      guidance to them in their dark struggle, “a gallows forty feet\r\n      high”! Certainly a singular Golden Age; with its Feasts of\r\n      Morals, its “sweet manners,” its sweet institutions\r\n      (_institutions douces_); betokening nothing but peace among\r\n      men!—Peace? O Philosophe-Sentimentalism, what hast thou to do\r\n      with peace, when thy mother’s name is Jezebel? Foul Product of\r\n      still fouler Corruption, thou with the corruption art doomed!\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile it is singular how long the rotten will hold together,\r\n      provided you do not handle it roughly. For whole generations it\r\n      continues standing, “with a ghastly affectation of life,” after\r\n      all life and truth has fled out of it; so loth are men to quit\r\n      their old ways; and, conquering indolence and inertia, venture on\r\n      new. Great truly is the Actual; is the Thing that has rescued\r\n      itself from bottomless deeps of theory and possibility, and\r\n      stands there as a definite indisputable Fact, whereby men do work\r\n      and live, or once did so. Widely shall men cleave to that, while\r\n      it will endure; and quit it with regret, when it gives way under\r\n      them. Rash enthusiast of Change, beware! Hast thou well\r\n      considered all that Habit does in this life of ours; how all\r\n      Knowledge and all Practice hang wondrous over infinite abysses of\r\n      the Unknown, Impracticable; and our whole being is an infinite\r\n      abyss, _overarched_ by Habit, as by a thin Earth-rind,\r\n      laboriously built together?\r\n\r\n      But if “every man,” as it has been written, “holds confined\r\n      within him a _mad_-man,” what must every Society do;—Society,\r\n      which in its commonest state is called “the standing miracle of\r\n      this world”! “Without such Earth-rind of Habit,” continues our\r\n      author, “call it System of Habits, in a word, _fixed ways_ of\r\n      acting and of believing,—Society would not exist at all. With\r\n      such it exists, better or worse. Herein too, in this its System\r\n      of Habits, acquired, retained how you will, lies the true\r\n      Law-Code and Constitution of a Society; the only Code, though an\r\n      unwritten one which it can in nowise _dis_obey. The thing we call\r\n      written Code, Constitution, Form of Government, and the like,\r\n      what is it but some miniature image, and solemnly expressed\r\n      summary of this unwritten Code? _Is_,—or rather alas, is _not;_\r\n      but only should be, and always tends to be! In which latter\r\n      discrepancy lies struggle without end.” And now, we add in the\r\n      same dialect, let but, by ill chance, in such ever-enduring\r\n      struggle,—your “thin Earth-rind” be once _broken!_ The fountains\r\n      of the great deep boil forth; fire-fountains, enveloping,\r\n      engulfing. Your “Earth-rind” is shattered, swallowed up; instead\r\n      of a green flowery world, there is a waste wild-weltering\r\n      chaos:—which has again, with tumult and struggle, to _make_\r\n      itself into a world.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, be this conceded: Where thou findest a Lie\r\n      that is oppressing thee, extinguish it. Lies exist there only to\r\n      be extinguished; they wait and cry earnestly for extinction.\r\n      Think well, meanwhile, in what spirit thou wilt do it: not with\r\n      hatred, with headlong selfish violence; but in clearness of\r\n      heart, with holy zeal, gently, almost with pity. Thou wouldst not\r\n      _replace_ such extinct Lie by a new Lie, which a new Injustice of\r\n      thy own were; the parent of still other Lies? Whereby the latter\r\n      end of that business were worse than the beginning.\r\n\r\n      So, however, in this world of ours, which has both an\r\n      indestructible hope in the Future, and an indestructible tendency\r\n      to persevere as in the Past, must Innovation and Conservation\r\n      wage their perpetual conflict, as they may and can. Wherein the\r\n      “dæmonic element,” that lurks in all human things, _may_\r\n      doubtless, some once in the thousand years—get vent! But indeed\r\n      may we not regret that such conflict,—which, after all, is but\r\n      like that classical one of “hate-filled Amazons with heroic\r\n      Youths,” and will end in _embraces_,—should usually be so\r\n      spasmodic? For Conservation, strengthened by that mightiest\r\n      quality in us, our indolence, sits for long ages, not victorious\r\n      only, which she should be; but tyrannical, incommunicative. She\r\n      holds her adversary as if annihilated; such adversary lying, all\r\n      the while, like some buried Enceladus; who, to gain the smallest\r\n      freedom, must stir a whole Trinacria with it Ætnas.\r\n\r\n      Wherefore, on the whole, we will honour a Paper Age too; an Era\r\n      of hope! For in this same frightful process of Enceladus Revolt;\r\n      when the task, on which no mortal would willingly enter, has\r\n      become imperative, inevitable,—is it not even a kindness of\r\n      Nature that she lures us forward by cheerful promises, fallacious\r\n      or not; and a whole generation plunges into the Erebus Blackness,\r\n      lighted on by an Era of Hope? It has been well said: “Man is\r\n      based on Hope; he has properly no other possession but Hope; this\r\n      habitation of his is named the Place of Hope.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.IV.\r\n      Maurepas.\r\n\r\n      But now, among French hopes, is not that of old M. de Maurepas\r\n      one of the best-grounded; who hopes that he, by dexterity, shall\r\n      contrive to continue Minister? Nimble old man, who for all\r\n      emergencies has his light jest; and ever in the worst confusion\r\n      will emerge, cork-like, unsunk! Small care to him is\r\n      Perfectibility, Progress of the Species, and _Astræa Redux:_ good\r\n      only, that a man of light wit, verging towards fourscore, can in\r\n      the seat of authority feel himself important among men. Shall we\r\n      call him, as haughty Châteauroux was wont of old, “_M. Faquinet_\r\n      (Diminutive of Scoundrel)”? In courtier dialect, he is now named\r\n      “the Nestor of France;” such governing Nestor as France has.\r\n\r\n      At bottom, nevertheless, it might puzzle one to say where the\r\n      Government of France, in these days, specially is. In that\r\n      Château of Versailles, we have Nestor, King, Queen, ministers and\r\n      clerks, with paper-bundles tied in tape: but the Government? For\r\n      Government is a thing that _governs_, that guides; and if need\r\n      be, compels. Visible in France there is not such a thing.\r\n      Invisible, inorganic, on the other hand, there is: in Philosophe\r\n      saloons, in Œil-de-Bœuf galleries; in the tongue of the babbler,\r\n      in the pen of the pamphleteer. Her Majesty appearing at the Opera\r\n      is applauded; she returns all radiant with joy. Anon the\r\n      applauses wax fainter, or threaten to cease; she is heavy of\r\n      heart, the light of her face has fled. Is Sovereignty some poor\r\n      Montgolfier; which, blown into by the popular wind, grows great\r\n      and mounts; or sinks flaccid, if the wind be withdrawn? France\r\n      was long a “Despotism tempered by Epigrams;” and now, it would\r\n      seem, the Epigrams have get the upper hand.\r\n\r\n      Happy were a young “Louis the Desired” to make France happy; if\r\n      it did not prove too troublesome, and he only knew the way. But\r\n      there is endless discrepancy round him; so many claims and\r\n      clamours; a mere confusion of tongues. Not reconcilable by man;\r\n      not manageable, suppressible, save by some strongest and wisest\r\n      men;—which only a lightly-jesting lightly-gyrating M. de Maurepas\r\n      can so much as subsist amidst. Philosophism claims her new Era,\r\n      meaning thereby innumerable things. And claims it in no faint\r\n      voice; for France at large, hitherto mute, is now beginning to\r\n      speak also; and speaks in that same sense. A huge, many-toned\r\n      sound; distant, yet not unimpressive. On the other hand, the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf, which, as nearest, one can hear best, claims with\r\n      shrill vehemence that the Monarchy be as heretofore a Horn of\r\n      Plenty; wherefrom loyal courtiers may draw,—to the just support\r\n      of the throne. Let Liberalism and a New Era, if such is the wish,\r\n      be introduced; only no curtailment of the royal moneys? Which\r\n      latter condition, alas, is precisely the impossible one.\r\n\r\n      Philosophism, as we saw, has got her Turgot made\r\n      Controller-General; and there shall be endless reformation.\r\n      Unhappily this Turgot could continue only twenty months. With a\r\n      miraculous _Fortunatus’ Purse_ in his Treasury, it might have\r\n      lasted longer; with such Purse indeed, every French\r\n      Controller-General, that would prosper in these days, ought first\r\n      to provide himself. But here again may we not remark the bounty\r\n      of Nature in regard to Hope? Man after man advances confident to\r\n      the Augean Stable, as if _he_ could clean it; expends his little\r\n      fraction of an ability on it, with such cheerfulness; does, in so\r\n      far as he was honest, accomplish something. Turgot has faculties;\r\n      honesty, insight, heroic volition; but the Fortunatus’ Purse he\r\n      has not. Sanguine Controller-General! a whole pacific French\r\n      Revolution may stand schemed in the head of the thinker; but who\r\n      shall pay the unspeakable “indemnities” that will be needed?\r\n      Alas, far from that: on the very threshold of the business, he\r\n      proposes that the Clergy, the Noblesse, the very Parlements be\r\n      subjected to taxes! One shriek of indignation and astonishment\r\n      reverberates through all the Château galleries; M. de Maurepas\r\n      has to gyrate: the poor King, who had written few weeks ago, “_Il\r\n      n’y a que vous et moi qui aimions le peuple_ (There is none but\r\n      you and I that has the people’s interest at heart),” must write\r\n      now a dismissal;[32] and let the French Revolution accomplish\r\n      itself, pacifically or not, as it can.\r\n\r\n      Hope, then, is deferred? Deferred; not destroyed, or abated. Is\r\n      not this, for example, our Patriarch Voltaire, after long years\r\n      of absence, revisiting Paris? With face shrivelled to nothing;\r\n      with “huge peruke _à la Louis Quatorze_, which leaves only two\r\n      eyes ‘visible’ glittering like carbuncles,” the old man is\r\n      here.[33] What an outburst! Sneering Paris has suddenly grown\r\n      reverent; devotional with Hero-worship. Nobles have disguised\r\n      themselves as tavern-waiters to obtain sight of him: the\r\n      loveliest of France would lay their hair beneath his feet. “His\r\n      chariot is the nucleus of a comet; whose train fills whole\r\n      streets:” they crown him in the theatre, with immortal vivats;\r\n      “finally stifle him under roses,”—for old Richelieu recommended\r\n      opium in such state of the nerves, and the excessive Patriarch\r\n      took too much. Her Majesty herself had some thought of sending\r\n      for him; but was dissuaded. Let Majesty consider it,\r\n      nevertheless. The purport of this man’s existence has been to\r\n      wither up and annihilate all whereon Majesty and Worship for the\r\n      present rests: and is it _so_ that the world recognises him? With\r\n      Apotheosis; as its Prophet and Speaker, who has spoken wisely the\r\n      thing it longed to say? Add only, that the body of this same\r\n      rose-stifled, beatified-Patriarch cannot get buried except by\r\n      stealth. It is wholly a notable business; and France, without\r\n      doubt, is _big_ (what the Germans call “Of good Hope”): we shall\r\n      wish her a happy birth-hour, and blessed fruit.\r\n\r\n      Beaumarchais too has now winded-up his Law-Pleadings\r\n      (_Mémoires_);[34] not without result, to himself and to the\r\n      world. Caron Beaumarchais (or de Beaumarchais, for he got\r\n      ennobled) had been born poor, but aspiring, esurient; with\r\n      talents, audacity, adroitness; above all, with the talent for\r\n      intrigue: a lean, but also a tough, indomitable man. Fortune and\r\n      dexterity brought him to the harpsichord of Mesdames, our good\r\n      Princesses _Loque, Graille_ and Sisterhood. Still better, Paris\r\n      Duvernier, the Court-Banker, honoured him with some confidence;\r\n      to the length even of transactions in cash. Which confidence,\r\n      however, Duvernier’s Heir, a person of quality, would not\r\n      continue. Quite otherwise; there springs a Lawsuit from it:\r\n      wherein tough Beaumarchais, losing both money and repute, is, in\r\n      the opinion of Judge-Reporter Goezman, of the Parlement Maupeou,\r\n      of a whole indifferent acquiescing world, miserably beaten. In\r\n      all men’s opinions, only not in his own! Inspired by the\r\n      indignation, which makes, if not verses, satirical law-papers,\r\n      the withered Music-master, with a desperate heroism, takes up his\r\n      lost cause in spite of the world; fights for it, against\r\n      Reporters, Parlements and Principalities, with light banter, with\r\n      clear logic; adroitly, with an inexhaustible toughness and\r\n      resource, like the skilfullest fencer; on whom, so skilful is he,\r\n      the whole world now looks. Three long years it lasts; with\r\n      wavering fortune. In fine, after labours comparable to the Twelve\r\n      of Hercules, our unconquerable Caron triumphs; regains his\r\n      Lawsuit and Lawsuits; strips Reporter Goezman of the judicial\r\n      ermine; covering him with a perpetual garment of obloquy\r\n      instead:—and in regard to the Parlement Maupeou (which he has\r\n      helped to extinguish), to Parlements of all kinds, and to French\r\n      Justice generally, gives rise to endless reflections in the minds\r\n      of men. Thus has Beaumarchais, like a lean French Hercules,\r\n      ventured down, driven by destiny, into the Nether Kingdoms; and\r\n      victoriously tamed hell-dogs there. He also is henceforth among\r\n      the notabilities of his generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.V.\r\n      Astræa Redux without Cash.\r\n\r\n      Observe, however, beyond the Atlantic, has not the new day verily\r\n      dawned! Democracy, as we said, is born; storm-girt, is struggling\r\n      for life and victory. A sympathetic France rejoices over the\r\n      Rights of Man; in all saloons, it is said, What a spectacle! Now\r\n      too behold our Deane, our Franklin, American Plenipotentiaries,\r\n      here in position soliciting;[35] the sons of the Saxon Puritans,\r\n      with their Old-Saxon temper, Old-Hebrew culture, sleek Silas,\r\n      sleek Benjamin, here on such errand, among the light children of\r\n      Heathenism, Monarchy, Sentimentalism, and the Scarlet-woman. A\r\n      spectacle indeed; over which saloons may cackle joyous; though\r\n      Kaiser Joseph, questioned on it, gave this answer, most\r\n      unexpected from a Philosophe: ‘Madame, the trade I live by is\r\n      that of royalist (_Mon métier à moi c’est d’être royaliste_).’\r\n\r\n      So thinks light Maurepas too; but the wind of Philosophism and\r\n      force of public opinion will blow him round. Best wishes,\r\n      meanwhile, are sent; clandestine privateers armed. Paul Jones\r\n      shall equip his _Bon Homme Richard:_ weapons, military stores can\r\n      be smuggled over (if the English do not seize them); wherein,\r\n      once more Beaumarchais, dimly as the Giant Smuggler becomes\r\n      visible,—filling his own lank pocket withal. But surely, in any\r\n      case, France should have a Navy. For which great object were not\r\n      now the time: now when that proud Termagant of the Seas has her\r\n      hands full? It is true, an impoverished Treasury cannot build\r\n      ships; but the hint once given (which Beaumarchais says he gave),\r\n      this and the other loyal Seaport, Chamber of Commerce, will build\r\n      and offer them. Goodly vessels bound into the waters; a _Ville de\r\n      Paris_, Leviathan of ships.\r\n\r\n      And now when gratuitous three-deckers dance there at anchor, with\r\n      streamers flying; and eleutheromaniac Philosophedom grows ever\r\n      more clamorous, what can a Maurepas do—but gyrate? Squadrons\r\n      cross the ocean: Gages, Lees, rough Yankee Generals, “with\r\n      woollen night-caps under their hats,” present arms to the\r\n      far-glancing Chivalry of France; and new-born Democracy sees, not\r\n      without amazement, “Despotism tempered by Epigrams” fight at her\r\n      side. So, however, it is. King’s forces and heroic volunteers;\r\n      Rochambeaus, Bouillés, Lameths, Lafayettes, have drawn their\r\n      swords in this sacred quarrel of mankind;—shall draw them again\r\n      elsewhere, in the strangest way.\r\n\r\n      Off Ushant some naval thunder is heard. In the course of which\r\n      did our young Prince, Duke de Chartres, “hide in the hold;” or\r\n      did he materially, by _active_ heroism, contribute to the\r\n      victory? Alas, by a second edition, we learn that there was no\r\n      victory; or that English Keppel had it.[36] Our poor young Prince\r\n      gets his Opera plaudits changed into mocking tehees; and cannot\r\n      become Grand-Admiral,—the source to him of woes which one may\r\n      call endless.\r\n\r\n      Woe also for _Ville de Paris_, the Leviathan of ships! English\r\n      Rodney has clutched it, and led it home, with the rest; so\r\n      successful was his new “manœuvre of breaking the enemy’s\r\n      line.”[37] It seems as if, according to Louis XV., “France were\r\n      never to have a Navy.” Brave Suffren must return from Hyder Ally\r\n      and the Indian Waters; with small result; yet with great glory\r\n      for “six” _non-defeats;_—which indeed, with such seconding as he\r\n      had, one may reckon heroic. Let the old sea-hero rest now,\r\n      honoured of France, in his native Cevennes mountains; send smoke,\r\n      not of gunpowder, but mere culinary smoke, through the old\r\n      chimneys of the Castle of Jalès,—which one day, in other hands,\r\n      shall have other fame. Brave Lapérouse shall by and by lift\r\n      anchor, on philanthropic Voyage of Discovery; for the King knows\r\n      Geography.[38] But, alas, this also will not prosper: the brave\r\n      Navigator goes, and returns not; the Seekers search far seas for\r\n      him in vain. He has vanished trackless into blue Immensity; and\r\n      only some mournful mysterious shadow of him hovers long in all\r\n      heads and hearts.\r\n\r\n      Neither, while the War yet lasts, will Gibraltar surrender. Not\r\n      though Crillon, Nassau-Siegen, with the ablest projectors extant,\r\n      are there; and Prince Condé and Prince d’Artois have hastened to\r\n      help. Wondrous leather-roofed Floating-batteries, set afloat by\r\n      French-Spanish _Pacte de Famille_, give gallant summons: to\r\n      which, nevertheless, Gibraltar answers Plutonically, with mere\r\n      torrents of redhot iron,—as if stone Calpe had become a throat of\r\n      the Pit; and utters such a Doom’s-blast of a No, as all men must\r\n      credit.[39]\r\n\r\n      And so, with this loud explosion, the noise of War has ceased; an\r\n      Age of Benevolence may hope, for ever. Our noble volunteers of\r\n      Freedom have returned, to be her missionaries. Lafayette, as the\r\n      matchless of his time, glitters in the Versailles Œil-de-Beouf;\r\n      has his Bust set up in the Paris Hôtel-de-Ville. Democracy stands\r\n      inexpugnable, immeasurable, in her New World; has even a foot\r\n      lifted towards the Old;—and our French Finances, little\r\n      strengthened by such work, are in no healthy way.\r\n\r\n      What to do with the Finance? This indeed is the great question: a\r\n      small but most black weather-symptom, which no radiance of\r\n      universal hope can cover. We saw Turgot cast forth from the\r\n      Controllership, with shrieks,—for want of a Fortunatus’ Purse. As\r\n      little could M. de Clugny manage the duty; or indeed do anything,\r\n      but consume his wages; attain “a place in History,” where as an\r\n      ineffectual shadow thou beholdest him still lingering;—and let\r\n      the duty manage itself. Did Genevese Necker _possess_ such a\r\n      Purse, then? He possessed banker’s skill, banker’s honesty;\r\n      _credit_ of all kinds, for he had written Academic Prize Essays,\r\n      struggled for India Companies, given dinners to Philosophes, and\r\n      “realised a fortune in twenty years.” He possessed, further, a\r\n      taciturnity and solemnity; of depth, or else of dulness. How\r\n      singular for Celadon Gibbon, false swain as he had proved; whose\r\n      father, keeping most probably his own gig, “would not hear of\r\n      such a union,”—to find now his forsaken Demoiselle Curchod\r\n      sitting in the high places of the world, as Minister’s Madame,\r\n      and “Necker not jealous!”[40]\r\n\r\n      A new young Demoiselle, one day to be famed as a Madame and De\r\n      Staël, was romping about the knees of the Decline and Fall: the\r\n      lady Necker founds Hospitals; gives solemn Philosophe\r\n      dinner-parties, to cheer her exhausted Controller-General.\r\n      Strange things have happened: by clamour of Philosophism,\r\n      management of Marquis de Pezay, and Poverty constraining even\r\n      Kings. And so Necker, Atlas-like, sustains the burden of the\r\n      Finances, for five years long?[41] Without wages, for he refused\r\n      such; cheered only by Public Opinion, and the ministering of his\r\n      noble Wife. With many thoughts in him, it is hoped;—which,\r\n      however, he is shy of uttering. His _Compte Rendu_, published by\r\n      the royal permission, fresh sign of a New Era, shows\r\n      wonders;—which what but the genius of some Atlas-Necker can\r\n      prevent from becoming portents? In Necker’s head too there is a\r\n      whole pacific French Revolution, of its kind; and in that\r\n      taciturn dull depth, or deep dulness, ambition enough.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, alas, his Fotunatus’ Purse turns out to be little\r\n      other than the old “_vectigal_ of Parsimony.” Nay, he too has to\r\n      produce his scheme of taxing: Clergy, Noblesse to be taxed;\r\n      Provincial Assemblies, and the rest,—like a mere Turgot! The\r\n      expiring M. de Maurepas must gyrate one other time. Let Necker\r\n      also depart; not unlamented.\r\n\r\n      Great in a private station, Necker looks on from the distance;\r\n      abiding his time. “Eighty thousand copies” of his new Book, which\r\n      he calls _Administration des Finances_, will be sold in few days.\r\n      He is gone; but shall return, and that more than once, borne by a\r\n      whole shouting Nation. Singular Controller-General of the\r\n      Finances; once Clerk in Thelusson’s Bank!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.VI.\r\n      Windbags.\r\n\r\n      So marches the world, in this its Paper Age, or Era of Hope. Not\r\n      without obstructions, war-explosions; which, however, heard from\r\n      such distance, are little other than a cheerful marching-music.\r\n      If indeed that dark living chaos of Ignorance and Hunger,\r\n      five-and-twenty million strong, under your feet,—were to begin\r\n      playing!\r\n\r\n      For the present, however, consider Longchamp; now when Lent is\r\n      ending, and the glory of Paris and France has gone forth, as in\r\n      annual wont. Not to assist at _Tenebris_ Masses, but to sun\r\n      itself and show itself, and salute the Young Spring.[42]\r\n      Manifold, bright-tinted, glittering with gold; all through the\r\n      Bois de Boulogne, in longdrawn variegated rows;—like longdrawn\r\n      living flower-borders, tulips, dahlias, lilies of the valley; all\r\n      in their moving flower-pots (of new-gilt carriages): pleasure of\r\n      the eye, and pride of life! So rolls and dances the Procession:\r\n      steady, of firm assurance, as if it rolled on adamant and the\r\n      foundations of the world; not on mere heraldic parchment,—under\r\n      which smoulders a lake of fire. Dance on, ye foolish ones; ye\r\n      sought not wisdom, neither have ye found it. Ye and your fathers\r\n      have sown the wind, ye shall reap the whirlwind. Was it not, from\r\n      of old, written: _The wages of sin is death?_\r\n\r\n      But at Longchamp, as elsewhere, we remark for one thing, that\r\n      dame and cavalier are waited on each by a kind of human familiar,\r\n      named _jokei._ Little elf, or imp; though young, already\r\n      withered; with its withered air of premature vice, of\r\n      knowingness, of completed elf-hood: useful in various\r\n      emergencies. The name _jokei_ (jockey) comes from the English; as\r\n      the thing also fancies that it does. Our Anglomania, in fact , is\r\n      grown considerable; prophetic of much. If France is to be free,\r\n      why shall she not, now when mad war is hushed, love neighbouring\r\n      Freedom? Cultivated men, your Dukes de Liancourt, de la\r\n      Rochefoucault admire the English Constitution, the English\r\n      National Character; would import what of it they can.\r\n\r\n      Of what is lighter, especially if it be light as wind, how much\r\n      easier the freightage! Non-Admiral Duke de Chartres (not yet\r\n      d’Orléans or Egalité) flies to and fro across the Strait;\r\n      importing English Fashions; this he, as hand-and-glove with an\r\n      English Prince of Wales, is surely qualified to do. Carriages and\r\n      saddles; top-boots and _rédingotes_, as we call riding-coats. Nay\r\n      the very mode of riding: for now no man on a level with his age\r\n      but will trot _à l’Anglaise_, rising in the stirrups; scornful of\r\n      the old sitfast method, in which, according to Shakspeare,\r\n      “butter and eggs” go to market. Also, he can urge the fervid\r\n      wheels, this brave Chartres of ours; no whip in Paris is rasher\r\n      and surer than the unprofessional one of Monseigneur.\r\n\r\n      Elf _jokeis_, we have seen; but see now real Yorkshire jockeys,\r\n      and what they ride on, and train: English racers for French\r\n      Races. These likewise we owe first (under the Providence of the\r\n      Devil) to Monseigneur. Prince d’Artois also has his stud of\r\n      racers. Prince d’Artois has withal the strangest horseleech: a\r\n      moonstruck, much-enduring individual, of Neuchâtel in\r\n      Switzerland,—named _Jean Paul Marat_. A problematic Chevalier\r\n      d’Eon, now in petticoats, now in breeches, is no less problematic\r\n      in London than in Paris; and causes bets and lawsuits. Beautiful\r\n      days of international communion! Swindlery and Blackguardism have\r\n      stretched hands across the Channel, and saluted mutually: on the\r\n      racecourse of Vincennes or Sablons, behold in English\r\n      curricle-and-four, wafted glorious among the principalities and\r\n      rascalities, an English Dr. Dodd,[43]—for whom also the too early\r\n      gallows gapes.\r\n\r\n      Duke de Chartres was a young Prince of great promise, as young\r\n      Princes often are; which promise unfortunately has belied itself.\r\n      With the huge Orléans Property, with Duke de Penthievre for\r\n      Father-in-law (and now the young Brother-in-law Lamballe killed\r\n      by excesses),—he will one day be the richest man in France.\r\n      Meanwhile, “his hair is all falling out, his blood is quite\r\n      spoiled,”—by early transcendentalism of debauchery. Carbuncles\r\n      stud his face; dark studs on a ground of burnished copper. A most\r\n      signal failure, this young Prince! The stuff prematurely burnt\r\n      out of him: little left but foul smoke and ashes of expiring\r\n      sensualities: what might have been Thought, Insight, and even\r\n      Conduct, gone now, or fast going,—to confused darkness, broken by\r\n      bewildering dazzlements; to obstreperous crotchets; to activities\r\n      which you may call semi-delirious, or even semi-galvanic! Paris\r\n      affects to laugh at his charioteering; but he heeds not such\r\n      laughter.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, what a day, not of laughter, was that, when he\r\n      threatened, for lucre’s sake, to lay sacrilegious hand on the\r\n      Palais-Royal Garden![44] The flower-parterres shall be riven up;\r\n      the Chestnut Avenues shall fall: time-honoured boscages, under\r\n      which the Opera Hamadryads were wont to wander, not inexorable to\r\n      men. Paris moans aloud. Philidor, from his Café de la Regence,\r\n      shall no longer look on greenness; the loungers and losels of the\r\n      world, where now shall they haunt? In vain is moaning. The axe\r\n      glitters; the sacred groves fall crashing,—for indeed Monseigneur\r\n      was short of money: the Opera Hamadryads fly with shrieks. Shriek\r\n      not, ye Opera Hamadryads; or not as those that have no comfort.\r\n      He will surround your Garden with new edifices and piazzas:\r\n      though narrowed, it shall be replanted; dizened with hydraulic\r\n      jets, cannon which the sun fires at noon; things bodily, things\r\n      spiritual, such as man has not imagined;—and in the Palais-Royal\r\n      shall again, and more than ever, be the _Sorcerer’s Sabbath_ and\r\n      _Satan-at-Home_ of our Planet.\r\n\r\n      What will not mortals attempt? From remote Annonay in the\r\n      Vivarais, the Brothers Montgolfier send up their paper-dome,\r\n      filled with the smoke of burnt wool.[45] The Vivarais provincial\r\n      assembly is to be prorogued this same day: Vivarais\r\n      Assembly-members applaud, and the shouts of congregated men. Will\r\n      victorious Analysis scale the very Heavens, then?\r\n\r\n      Paris hears with eager wonder; Paris shall ere long see. From\r\n      Reveilion’s Paper-warehouse there, in the Rue St. Antoine (a\r\n      noted Warehouse),—the new Montgolfier air-ship launches itself.\r\n      Ducks and poultry are borne skyward: but now shall men be\r\n      borne.[46] Nay, Chemist Charles thinks of hydrogen and glazed\r\n      silk. Chemist Charles will himself ascend, from the Tuileries\r\n      Garden; Montgolfier solemnly cutting the cord. By Heaven, he also\r\n      mounts, he and another? Ten times ten thousand hearts go\r\n      palpitating; all tongues are mute with wonder and fear; till a\r\n      shout, like the voice of seas, rolls after him, on his wild way.\r\n      He soars, he dwindles upwards; has become a mere gleaming\r\n      circlet,—like some Turgotine snuff-box, what we call “_Turgotine\r\n      Platitude;_” like some new daylight Moon! Finally he descends;\r\n      welcomed by the universe. Duchess Polignac, with a party, is in\r\n      the Bois de Boulogne, waiting; though it is drizzly winter; the\r\n      1st of December 1783. The whole chivalry of France, Duke de\r\n      Chartres foremost, gallops to receive him.[47]\r\n\r\n      Beautiful invention; mounting heavenward, so beautifully,—so\r\n      unguidably! Emblem of much, and of our Age of Hope itself; which\r\n      shall mount, specifically-light, majestically in this same\r\n      manner; and hover,—tumbling whither Fate will. Well if it do not,\r\n      Pilatre-like, explode; and demount all the more tragically!—So,\r\n      riding on windbags, will men scale the Empyrean.\r\n\r\n      Or observe Herr Doctor Mesmer, in his spacious Magnetic Halls.\r\n      Long-stoled he walks; reverend, glancing upwards, as in rapt\r\n      commerce; an Antique Egyptian Hierophant in this new age. Soft\r\n      music flits; breaking fitfully the sacred stillness. Round their\r\n      Magnetic Mystery, which to the eye is mere tubs with water,—sit\r\n      breathless, rod in hand, the circles of Beauty and Fashion, each\r\n      circle a living circular _Passion-Flower:_ expecting the magnetic\r\n      afflatus, and new-manufactured Heaven-on-Earth. O women, O men,\r\n      great is your infidel-faith! A Parlementary Duport, a Bergasse,\r\n      D’Espréménil we notice there; Chemist Berthollet too,—on the part\r\n      of Monseigneur de Chartres.\r\n\r\n      Had not the Academy of Sciences, with its Baillys, Franklins,\r\n      Lavoisiers, interfered! But it did interfere. (Lacretelle, 18me\r\n      Siecle, iii.258.) Mesmer may pocket his hard money, and withdraw.\r\n      Let him walk silent by the shore of the Bodensee, by the ancient\r\n      town of Constance; meditating on much. For so, under the\r\n      strangest new vesture, the old great truth (since no vesture can\r\n      hide it) begins again to be revealed: That man is what we call a\r\n      miraculous creature, with miraculous power over men; and, on the\r\n      whole, with such a Life in him, and such a World round him, as\r\n      victorious Analysis, with her Physiologies, Nervous-systems,\r\n      Physic and Metaphysic, will never completely _name_, to say\r\n      nothing of explaining. Wherein also the Quack shall, in all ages,\r\n      come in for his share.[48]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.VII.\r\n      Contrat Social.\r\n\r\n      In such succession of singular prismatic tints, flush after flush\r\n      suffusing our horizon, does the Era of Hope dawn on towards\r\n      fulfilment. Questionable! As indeed, with an Era of Hope that\r\n      rests on mere universal Benevolence, victorious Analysis, Vice\r\n      cured of its deformity; and, in the long run, on Twenty-five dark\r\n      savage Millions, looking up, in hunger and weariness, to that\r\n      _Ecce-signum_ of theirs “forty feet high,”—how could it but be\r\n      questionable?\r\n\r\n      Through all time, if we read aright, sin was, is, will be, the\r\n      parent of misery. This land calls itself most Christian, and has\r\n      crosses and cathedrals; but its High-priest is some Roche-Aymon,\r\n      some Necklace-Cardinal Louis de Rohan. The voice of the poor,\r\n      through long years, ascends inarticulate, in _Jacqueries_,\r\n      meal-mobs; low-whimpering of infinite moan: unheeded of the\r\n      Earth; not unheeded of Heaven. Always moreover where the Millions\r\n      are wretched, there are the Thousands straitened, unhappy; only\r\n      the Units can flourish; or say rather, be ruined the last.\r\n      Industry, all noosed and haltered, as if it too were some beast\r\n      of chase for the mighty hunters of this world to bait, and cut\r\n      slices from,—cries passionately to these its well-paid guides and\r\n      watchers, not, _Guide me;_ but, _Laissez faire,_ Leave me alone\r\n      of _your_ guidance! What market has Industry in this France? For\r\n      two things there may be market and demand: for the coarser kind\r\n      of field-fruits, since the Millions will live: for the fine kinds\r\n      of luxury and spicery,—of multiform taste, from opera-melodies\r\n      down to racers and courtesans; since the Units will be amused. It\r\n      is at bottom but a mad state of things.\r\n\r\n      To mend and remake all which we have, indeed, victorious\r\n      Analysis. Honour to victorious Analysis; nevertheless, out of the\r\n      Workshop and Laboratory, what thing was victorious Analysis yet\r\n      known to make? Detection of incoherences, mainly; destruction of\r\n      the incoherent. From of old, Doubt was but half a magician; she\r\n      evokes the spectres which she cannot quell. We shall have\r\n      “endless vortices of froth-logic;” whereon first words, and then\r\n      things, are whirled and swallowed. Remark, accordingly, as\r\n      acknowledged grounds of Hope, at bottom mere precursors of\r\n      Despair, this perpetual theorising about Man, the Mind of Man,\r\n      Philosophy of Government, Progress of the Species and such-like;\r\n      the main thinking furniture of every head. Time, and so many\r\n      Montesquieus, Mablys, spokesmen of Time, have discovered\r\n      innumerable things: and now has not Jean Jacques promulgated his\r\n      new Evangel of a _Contrat Social;_ explaining the whole mystery\r\n      of Government, and how it is _contracted_ and bargained for,—to\r\n      universal satisfaction? Theories of Government! Such have been,\r\n      and will be; in ages of decadence. Acknowledge them in their\r\n      degree; as processes of Nature, who does nothing in vain; as\r\n      steps in her great process. Meanwhile, what theory is so certain\r\n      as this, That all theories, were they never so earnest, painfully\r\n      elaborated, are, and, by the very conditions of them, must be\r\n      incomplete, questionable, and even false? Thou shalt know that\r\n      this Universe is, what it professes to be, an _infinite_ one.\r\n      Attempt not to swallow _it_, for thy logical digestion; be\r\n      thankful, if skilfully planting down this and the other fixed\r\n      pillar in the chaos, thou prevent its swallowing _thee_. That a\r\n      new young generation has exchanged the Sceptic Creed, _What shall\r\n      I believe?_ for passionate Faith in this Gospel according to Jean\r\n      Jacques is a further step in the business; and betokens much.\r\n\r\n      Blessed also is Hope; and always from the beginning there was\r\n      some Millennium prophesied; Millennium of Holiness; but (what is\r\n      notable) never till this new Era, any Millennium of mere Ease and\r\n      plentiful Supply. In such prophesied Lubberland, of Happiness,\r\n      Benevolence, and Vice cured of its deformity, trust not, my\r\n      friends! Man is not what one calls a happy animal; his appetite\r\n      for sweet victual is so enormous. How, in this wild Universe,\r\n      which storms in on him, infinite, vague-menacing, shall poor man\r\n      find, say not happiness, but existence, and footing to stand on,\r\n      if it be not by girding himself together for continual endeavour\r\n      and endurance? Woe, if in his heart there dwelt no devout Faith;\r\n      if the word Duty had lost its meaning for him! For as to this of\r\n      Sentimentalism, so useful for weeping with over romances and on\r\n      pathetic occasions, it otherwise verily will avail nothing; nay\r\n      less. The healthy heart that said to itself, “How healthy am I!”\r\n      was already fallen into the fatalest sort of disease. Is not\r\n      Sentimentalism twin-sister to Cant, if not one and the same with\r\n      it? Is not Cant the _materia prima_ of the Devil; from which all\r\n      falsehoods, imbecilities, abominations body themselves; from\r\n      which no true thing _can_ come? For Cant is itself properly a\r\n      double-distilled Lie; the second-power of a Lie.\r\n\r\n      And now if a whole Nation fall into that? In such case, I answer,\r\n      infallibly they will return out of it! For life is no\r\n      cunningly-devised deception or self-deception: it is a great\r\n      truth that thou art alive, that thou hast desires, necessities;\r\n      neither can these subsist and satisfy themselves on delusions,\r\n      but on fact. To fact, depend on it, we shall come back: to such\r\n      fact, blessed or cursed, as we have wisdom for. The lowest, least\r\n      blessed fact one knows of, on which necessitous mortals have ever\r\n      based themselves, seems to be the primitive one of Cannibalism:\r\n      That _I_ can devour _Thee_. What if such Primitive Fact were\r\n      precisely the one we had (with our improved methods) to revert\r\n      to, and begin anew from!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.2.VIII.\r\n      Printed Paper.\r\n\r\n      In such a practical France, let the theory of Perfectibility say\r\n      what it will, discontents cannot be wanting: your promised\r\n      Reformation is so indispensable; yet it comes not; who will begin\r\n      it—with himself? Discontent with what is around us, still more\r\n      with what is above us, goes on increasing; seeking ever new\r\n      vents.\r\n\r\n      Of Street Ballads, of Epigrams that from of old tempered\r\n      Despotism, we need not speak. Nor of Manuscript Newspapers\r\n      (_Nouvelles à la main_) do we speak. Bachaumont and his\r\n      journeymen and followers may close those “thirty volumes of\r\n      scurrilous eaves-dropping,” and quit that trade; for at length if\r\n      not liberty of the Press, there is license. Pamphlets can be\r\n      surreptititiously vended and read in Paris, did they even bear to\r\n      be “Printed at Pekin.” We have a _Courrier de l’Europe_ in those\r\n      years, regularly published at London; by a De Morande, whom the\r\n      guillotine has not yet devoured. There too an unruly Linguet,\r\n      still unguillotined, when his own country has become too hot for\r\n      him, and his brother Advocates have cast him out, can emit his\r\n      hoarse wailings, and _Bastille Dévoilée_ (Bastille unveiled).\r\n      Loquacious Abbé Raynal, at length, has his wish; sees the\r\n      _Histoire Philosophique,_ with its “lubricity,” unveracity, loose\r\n      loud eleutheromaniac rant (contributed, they say, by\r\n      Philosophedom at large, though in the Abbé’s name, and to his\r\n      glory), burnt by the common hangman;—and sets out on his travels\r\n      as a martyr. It was the edition of 1781; perhaps the last notable\r\n      book that had such fire-beatitude,—the hangman discovering now\r\n      that it did not serve.\r\n\r\n      Again, in Courts of Law, with their money-quarrels,\r\n      divorce-cases, wheresoever a glimpse into the household existence\r\n      can be had, what indications! The Parlements of Besancon and Aix\r\n      ring, audible to all France, with the amours and destinies of a\r\n      young Mirabeau. He, under the nurture of a “Friend of Men,” has,\r\n      in State Prisons, in marching Regiments, Dutch Authors” garrets,\r\n      and quite other scenes, “been for twenty years learning to resist\r\n      despotism:” despotism of men, and alas also of gods. How, beneath\r\n      this rose-coloured veil of Universal Benevolence and _Astræa\r\n      Redux_, is the sanctuary of Home so often a dreary void, or a\r\n      dark contentious Hell-on-Earth! The old Friend of Men has his own\r\n      divorce case too; and at times, “his whole family but one” under\r\n      lock and key: he writes much about reforming and enfranchising\r\n      the world; and for his own private behoof he has needed sixty\r\n      _Lettres-de-Cachet_. A man of insight too, with resolution, even\r\n      with manful principle: but in such an element, inward and\r\n      outward; which he could not rule, but only madden. Edacity,\r\n      rapacity;—quite contrary to the finer sensibilities of the heart!\r\n      Fools, that expect your verdant Millennium, and nothing but Love\r\n      and Abundance, brooks running wine, winds whispering music,—with\r\n      the whole ground and basis of your existence champed into a mud\r\n      of Sensuality; which, daily growing deeper, will soon have no\r\n      bottom but the Abyss!\r\n\r\n      Or consider that unutterable business of the Diamond Necklace.\r\n      Red-hatted Cardinal Louis de Rohan; Sicilian jail-bird Balsamo\r\n      Cagliostro; milliner Dame de Lamotte, “with a face of some\r\n      piquancy:” the highest Church Dignitaries waltzing, in Walpurgis\r\n      Dance, with quack-prophets, pickpurses and public women;—a whole\r\n      Satan’s Invisible World displayed; working there continually\r\n      under the daylight visible one; the smoke of its torment going up\r\n      for ever! The Throne has been brought into scandalous collision\r\n      with the Treadmill. Astonished Europe rings with the mystery for\r\n      ten months; sees only lie unfold itself from lie; corruption\r\n      among the lofty and the low, gulosity, credulity, imbecility,\r\n      strength nowhere but in the hunger. Weep, fair Queen, thy first\r\n      tears of unmixed wretchedness! Thy fair name has been tarnished\r\n      by foul breath; irremediably while life lasts. No more shalt thou\r\n      be loved and pitied by living hearts, till a new generation has\r\n      been born, and thy own heart lies cold, cured of all its\r\n      sorrows.—The Epigrams henceforth become, not sharp and bitter;\r\n      but cruel, atrocious, unmentionable. On that 31st of May, 1786, a\r\n      miserable Cardinal Grand-Almoner Rohan, on issuing from his\r\n      Bastille, is escorted by hurrahing crowds: unloved he, and worthy\r\n      of no love; but important since the Court and Queen are his\r\n      enemies.[49]\r\n\r\n      How is our bright Era of Hope dimmed: and the whole sky growing\r\n      bleak with signs of hurricane and earthquake! It is a doomed\r\n      world: gone all “obedience that made men free;” fast going the\r\n      obedience that made men slaves,—at least to one another. Slaves\r\n      only of their own lusts they now are, and will be. Slaves of sin;\r\n      inevitably also of sorrow. Behold the mouldering mass of\r\n      Sensuality and Falsehood; round which plays foolishly, itself a\r\n      corrupt phosphorescence, some glimmer of Sentimentalism;—and over\r\n      all, rising, as Ark of _their_ Covenant, the grim Patibulary Fork\r\n      “forty feet high;” which also is now nigh rotted. Add only that\r\n      the French Nation distinguishes itself among Nations by the\r\n      characteristic of Excitability; with the good, but also with the\r\n      perilous evil, which belongs to that. Rebellion, explosion, of\r\n      unknown extent is to be calculated on. There are, as Chesterfield\r\n      wrote, “all the symptoms I have ever met with in History!”\r\n\r\n      Shall we say, then: Wo to Philosophism, that it destroyed\r\n      Religion, what it called “extinguishing the abomination (_écraser\r\n      l’infâme_)”? Wo rather to those that made the Holy an\r\n      abomination, and extinguishable; wo at all men that live in such\r\n      a time of world-abomination and world-destruction! Nay, answer\r\n      the Courtiers, it was Turgot, it was Necker, with their mad\r\n      innovating; it was the Queen’s want of etiquette; it was he, it\r\n      was she, it was that. Friends! it was every scoundrel that had\r\n      lived, and quack-like pretended to be doing, and been only eating\r\n      and _mis_doing, in all provinces of life, as Shoeblack or as\r\n      Sovereign Lord, each in his degree, from the time of Charlemagne\r\n      and earlier. All this (for be sure no falsehood perishes, but is\r\n      as seed sown out to grow) has been storing itself for thousands\r\n      of years; and now the account-day has come. And rude will the\r\n      settlement be: of wrath laid up against the day of wrath. O my\r\n      Brother, be not thou a Quack! Die rather, if thou wilt take\r\n      counsel; ’tis but dying once, and thou art quit of it for ever.\r\n      Cursed is that trade; and bears curses, thou knowest not how,\r\n      long ages after thou art departed, and the wages thou hadst are\r\n      all consumed; nay, as the ancient wise have written,—through\r\n      Eternity itself, and is verily marked in the Doom-Book of a God!\r\n\r\n      Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. And yet, as we said, Hope is\r\n      but deferred; not abolished, not abolishable. It is very notable,\r\n      and touching, how this same Hope does still light onwards the\r\n      French Nation through all its wild destinies. For we shall still\r\n      find Hope shining, be it for fond invitation, be it for anger and\r\n      menace; as a mild heavenly light it shone; as a red conflagration\r\n      it shines: burning sulphurous blue, through darkest regions of\r\n      Terror, it still shines; and goes sent out at all, since\r\n      Desperation itself is a kind of Hope. Thus is our Era still to be\r\n      named of Hope, though in the saddest sense,—when there is nothing\r\n      left but Hope.\r\n\r\n      But if any one would know summarily what a Pandora’s Box lies\r\n      there for the opening, he may see it in what by its nature is the\r\n      symptom of all symptoms, the surviving Literature of the Period.\r\n      Abbé Raynal, with his lubricity and loud loose rant, has spoken\r\n      _his_ word; and already the fast-hastening generation responds to\r\n      another. Glance at Beaumarchais’ _Mariage de Figaro;_ which now\r\n      (in 1784), after difficulty enough, has issued on the stage; and\r\n      “runs its hundred nights,” to the admiration of all men. By what\r\n      virtue or internal vigour it so ran, the reader of our day will\r\n      rather wonder:—and indeed will know so much the better that it\r\n      flattered some pruriency of the time; that it spoke what all were\r\n      feeling, and longing to speak. Small substance in that _Figaro:_\r\n      thin wiredrawn intrigues, thin wiredrawn sentiments and sarcasms;\r\n      a thing lean, barren; yet which winds and whisks itself, as\r\n      through a wholly mad universe, adroitly, with a high-sniffing\r\n      air: wherein each, as was hinted, which is the grand secret, may\r\n      see some image of himself, and of his own state and ways. So it\r\n      runs its hundred nights, and all France runs with it; laughing\r\n      applause. If the soliloquising Barber ask: ‘What has your\r\n      Lordship done to earn all this?’ and can only answer: ‘You took\r\n      the trouble to be born (_Vous vous êtes donné la peine de\r\n      naître_),’ all men must laugh: and a gay horse-racing Anglomaniac\r\n      Noblesse loudest of all. For how can small books have a great\r\n      danger in them? asks the Sieur Caron; and fancies his thin\r\n      epigram may be a kind of reason. Conqueror of a golden fleece, by\r\n      giant smuggling; tamer of hell-dogs, in the Parlement Maupeou;\r\n      and finally crowned Orpheus in the _Théâtre Français_,\r\n      Beaumarchais has now culminated, and unites the attributes of\r\n      several demigods. We shall meet him once again, in the course of\r\n      his decline.\r\n\r\n      Still more significant are two Books produced on the eve of the\r\n      ever-memorable Explosion itself, and read eagerly by all the\r\n      world: Saint-Pierre’s _Paul et Virginie_, and Louvet’s _Chevalier\r\n      de Faublas_. Noteworthy Books; which may be considered as the\r\n      last speech of old Feudal France. In the first there rises\r\n      melodiously, as it were, the wail of a moribund world: everywhere\r\n      wholesome Nature in unequal conflict with diseased perfidious\r\n      Art; cannot escape from it in the lowest hut, in the remotest\r\n      island of the sea. Ruin and death must strike down the loved one;\r\n      and, what is most significant of all, death even here not by\r\n      necessity, but by etiquette. What a world of prurient corruption\r\n      lies visible in that super-sublime of modesty! Yet, on the whole,\r\n      our good Saint-Pierre is musical, poetical though most morbid: we\r\n      will call his Book the swan-song of old dying France.\r\n\r\n      Louvet’s again, let no man account musical. Truly, if this\r\n      wretched _Faublas_ is a death-speech, it is one under the\r\n      gallows, and by a felon that does not repent. Wretched _cloaca_\r\n      of a Book; without depth even as a cloaca! What “picture of\r\n      French society” is here? Picture properly of nothing, if not of\r\n      the mind that gave it out as some sort of picture. Yet symptom of\r\n      much; above all, of the world that could nourish itself thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 1.III.\r\n      THE PARLEMENT OF PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.I.\r\n      Dishonoured Bills.\r\n\r\n      While the unspeakable confusion is everywhere weltering within,\r\n      and through so many cracks in the surface sulphur-smoke is\r\n      issuing, the question arises: Through what crevice will the main\r\n      Explosion carry itself? Through which of the old craters or\r\n      chimneys; or must it, at once, form a new crater for itself? In\r\n      every Society are such chimneys, are Institutions serving as\r\n      such: even Constantinople is not without its safety-valves; there\r\n      too Discontent can vent itself,—in material fire; by the number\r\n      of nocturnal conflagrations, or of hanged bakers, the Reigning\r\n      Power can read the signs of the times, and change course\r\n      according to these.\r\n\r\n      We may say that this French Explosion will doubtless first try\r\n      all the old Institutions of escape; for by each of these there\r\n      is, or at least there used to be, some communication with the\r\n      interior deep; they are national Institutions in virtue of that.\r\n      Had they even become personal Institutions, and what we can call\r\n      choked up from their original uses, there nevertheless must the\r\n      impediment be weaker than elsewhere. Through which of them then?\r\n      An observer might have guessed: Through the Law Parlements; above\r\n      all, through the Parlement of Paris.\r\n\r\n      Men, though never so thickly clad in dignities, sit not\r\n      inaccessible to the influences of their time; especially men\r\n      whose life is business; who at all turns, were it even from\r\n      behind judgment-seats, have come in contact with the actual\r\n      workings of the world. The Counsellor of Parlement, the President\r\n      himself, who has bought his place with hard money that he might\r\n      be looked up to by his fellow-creatures, how shall he, in all\r\n      Philosophe-soirées, and saloons of elegant culture, become\r\n      notable as a Friend of Darkness? Among the Paris Long-robes there\r\n      may be more than one patriotic Malesherbes, whose rule is\r\n      conscience and the public good; there are clearly more than one\r\n      hotheaded D’Espréménil, to whose confused thought any loud\r\n      reputation of the Brutus sort may seem glorious. The\r\n      Lepelletiers, Lamoignons have titles and wealth; yet, at Court,\r\n      are only styled “Noblesse of the Robe.” There are Duports of deep\r\n      scheme; Fréteaus, Sabatiers, of incontinent tongue: all nursed\r\n      more or less on the milk of the _Contrat Social_. Nay, for the\r\n      whole Body, is not this patriotic opposition also a fighting for\r\n      oneself? Awake, Parlement of Paris, renew thy long warfare! Was\r\n      not the Parlement Maupeou abolished with ignominy? Not now hast\r\n      thou to dread a Louis XIV., with the crack of his whip, and his\r\n      Olympian looks; not now a Richelieu and Bastilles: no, the whole\r\n      Nation is behind thee. Thou too (O heavens!) mayest become a\r\n      Political Power; and with the shakings of thy horse-hair wig\r\n      shake principalities and dynasties, like a very Jove with his\r\n      ambrosial curls!\r\n\r\n      Light old M. de Maurepas, since the end of 1781, has been fixed\r\n      in the frost of death: ‘Never more,’ said the good Louis, ‘shall\r\n      I hear his step overhead;’ his light jestings and gyratings are\r\n      at an end. No more can the importunate reality be hidden by\r\n      pleasant wit, and today’s evil be deftly rolled over upon\r\n      tomorrow. The morrow itself has arrived; and now nothing but a\r\n      solid phlegmatic M. de Vergennes sits there, in dull matter of\r\n      fact, like some dull punctual Clerk (which he originally was);\r\n      admits what cannot be denied, let the remedy come whence it will.\r\n      In him is no remedy; only clerklike “despatch of business”\r\n      according to routine. The poor King, grown older yet hardly more\r\n      experienced, must himself, with such no-faculty as he has, begin\r\n      governing; wherein also his Queen will give help. Bright Queen,\r\n      with her quick clear glances and impulses; clear, and even noble;\r\n      but all too superficial, vehement-shallow, for that work! To\r\n      govern France were such a problem; and now it has grown well-nigh\r\n      too hard to govern even the Œil-de-Bœuf. For if a distressed\r\n      People has its cry, so likewise, and more audibly, has a bereaved\r\n      Court. To the Œil-de-Bœuf it remains inconceivable how, in a\r\n      France of such resources, the Horn of Plenty should run dry: did\r\n      it not _use_ to flow? Nevertheless Necker, with his revenue of\r\n      parsimony, has “suppressed above six hundred places,” before the\r\n      Courtiers could oust him; parsimonious finance-pedant as he was.\r\n      Again, a military pedant, Saint-Germain, with his Prussian\r\n      manœuvres; with his Prussian notions, as if merit and not\r\n      coat-of-arms should be the rule of promotion, has disaffected\r\n      military men; the Mousquetaires, with much else are suppressed:\r\n      for he too was one of your suppressors; and unsettling and\r\n      oversetting, did mere mischief—to the Œil-de-Bœuf. Complaints\r\n      abound; scarcity, anxiety: it is a changed Œil-de-Bœuf. Besenval\r\n      says, already in these years (1781) there was such a melancholy\r\n      (such a _tristesse_) about Court, compared with former days, as\r\n      made it quite dispiriting to look upon.\r\n\r\n      No wonder that the Œil-de-Bœuf feels melancholy, when you are\r\n      suppressing its places! Not a place can be suppressed, but some\r\n      purse is the lighter for it; and more than one heart the heavier;\r\n      for did it not employ the working-classes too,—manufacturers,\r\n      male and female, of laces, essences; of Pleasure generally,\r\n      whosoever could manufacture Pleasure? Miserable economies; never\r\n      felt over Twenty-five Millions! So, however, it goes on: and is\r\n      not yet ended. Few years more and the Wolf-hounds shall fall\r\n      suppressed, the Bear-hounds, the Falconry; places shall fall,\r\n      thick as autumnal leaves. Duke de Polignac demonstrates, to the\r\n      complete silencing of ministerial logic, that his place cannot be\r\n      abolished; then gallantly, turning to the Queen, surrenders it,\r\n      since her Majesty so wishes. Less chivalrous was Duke de Coigny,\r\n      and yet not luckier: ‘We got into a real quarrel, Coigny and I,’\r\n      said King Louis; ‘but if he had even struck me, I could not have\r\n      blamed him.’[50] In regard to such matters there can be but one\r\n      opinion. Baron Besenval, with that frankness of speech which\r\n      stamps the independent man, plainly assures her Majesty that it\r\n      is frightful (_affreux_); ‘you go to bed, and are not sure but\r\n      you shall rise impoverished on the morrow: one might as well be\r\n      in Turkey.’ It is indeed a dog’s life.\r\n\r\n      How singular this perpetual distress of the royal treasury! And\r\n      yet it is a thing not more incredible than undeniable. A thing\r\n      mournfully true: the stumbling-block on which all Ministers\r\n      successively stumble, and fall. Be it “want of fiscal genius,” or\r\n      some far other want, there is the palpablest discrepancy between\r\n      Revenue and Expenditure; a _Deficit_ of the Revenue: you must\r\n      “choke (_combler_) the Deficit,” or else it will swallow you!\r\n      This is the stern problem; hopeless seemingly as squaring of the\r\n      circle. Controller Joly de Fleury, who succeeded Necker, could do\r\n      nothing with it; nothing but propose loans, which were tardily\r\n      filled up; impose new taxes, unproductive of money, productive of\r\n      clamour and discontent. As little could Controller d’Ormesson do,\r\n      or even less; for if Joly maintained himself beyond year and day,\r\n      d’Ormesson reckons only by months: till “the King purchased\r\n      Rambouillet without consulting him,” which he took as a hint to\r\n      withdraw. And so, towards the end of 1783, matters threaten to\r\n      come to still-stand. Vain seems human ingenuity. In vain has our\r\n      newly-devised “Council of Finances” struggled, our Intendants of\r\n      Finance, Controller-General of Finances: there are unhappily no\r\n      Finances to control. Fatal paralysis invades the social movement;\r\n      clouds, of blindness or of blackness, envelop us: are we breaking\r\n      down, then, into the black horrors of NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY?\r\n\r\n      Great is Bankruptcy: the great bottomless gulf into which all\r\n      Falsehoods, public and private, do sink, disappearing; whither,\r\n      from the first origin of them, they were all doomed. For Nature\r\n      is true and not a lie. No lie you can speak or act but it will\r\n      come, after longer or shorter circulation, like a Bill drawn on\r\n      Nature’s Reality, and be presented there for payment,—with the\r\n      answer, _No effects_. Pity only that it often had so long a\r\n      circulation: that the original forger were so seldom he who bore\r\n      the final smart of it! Lies, and the burden of evil they bring,\r\n      are passed on; shifted from back to back, and from rank to rank;\r\n      and so land ultimately on the dumb lowest rank, who with spade\r\n      and mattock, with sore heart and empty wallet, daily come in\r\n      _contact_ with reality, and can pass the cheat no further.\r\n\r\n      Observe nevertheless how, by a just compensating law, if the lie\r\n      with its burden (in this confused whirlpool of Society) sinks and\r\n      is shifted ever downwards, then in return the distress of it\r\n      rises ever upwards and upwards. Whereby, after the long pining\r\n      and demi-starvation of those Twenty Millions, a Duke de Coigny\r\n      and his Majesty come also to have their “real quarrel.” Such is\r\n      the law of just Nature; bringing, though at long intervals, and\r\n      were it only by Bankruptcy, matters round again to the mark.\r\n\r\n      But with a Fortunatus’ Purse in his pocket, through what length\r\n      of time might not almost any Falsehood last! Your Society, your\r\n      Household, practical or spiritual Arrangement, is untrue, unjust,\r\n      offensive to the eye of God and man. Nevertheless its hearth is\r\n      warm, its larder well replenished: the innumerable Swiss of\r\n      Heaven, with a kind of Natural loyalty, gather round it; will\r\n      prove, by pamphleteering, musketeering, that it is a truth; or if\r\n      not an unmixed (unearthly, impossible) Truth, then better, a\r\n      wholesomely attempered one, (as wind is to the shorn lamb), and\r\n      works well. Changed outlook, however, when purse and larder grow\r\n      empty! Was your Arrangement so true, so accordant to Nature’s\r\n      ways, then how, in the name of wonder, has Nature, with her\r\n      infinite bounty, come to leave it famishing there? To all men, to\r\n      all women and all children, it is now indutiable that your\r\n      Arrangement was _false_. Honour to Bankruptcy; ever righteous on\r\n      the great scale, though in detail it is so cruel! Under all\r\n      Falsehoods it works, unweariedly mining. No Falsehood, did it\r\n      rise heaven-high and cover the world, but Bankruptcy, one day,\r\n      will sweep it down, and make us free of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.II.\r\n      Controller Calonne.\r\n\r\n      Under such circumstances of _tristesse_, obstruction and sick\r\n      langour, when to an exasperated Court it seems as if fiscal\r\n      genius had departed from among men, what apparition could be\r\n      welcomer than that of M. de Calonne? Calonne, a man of\r\n      indisputable genius; even fiscal genius, more or less; of\r\n      experience both in managing Finance and Parlements, for he has\r\n      been Intendant at Metz, at Lille; King’s Procureur at Douai. A\r\n      man of weight, connected with the moneyed classes; of unstained\r\n      name,—if it were not some peccadillo (of showing a Client’s\r\n      Letter) in that old D’Aiguillon-Lachalotais business, as good as\r\n      forgotten now. He has kinsmen of heavy purse, felt on the Stock\r\n      Exchange. Our Foulons, Berthiers intrigue for him:—old Foulon,\r\n      who has now nothing to do but intrigue; who is known and even\r\n      seen to be what they call a scoundrel; but of unmeasured wealth;\r\n      who, from Commissariat-clerk which he once was, may hope, some\r\n      think, if the game go right, to be Minister himself one day.\r\n\r\n      Such propping and backing has M. de Calonne; and then\r\n      intrinsically such qualities! Hope radiates from his face;\r\n      persuasion hangs on his tongue. For all straits he has present\r\n      remedy, and will make the world roll on wheels before him. On the\r\n      3d of November 1783, the Œil-de-Bœuf rejoices in its new\r\n      Controller-General. Calonne also shall have trial; Calonne also,\r\n      in his way, as Turgot and Necker had done in theirs, shall\r\n      forward the consummation; suffuse, with one other flush of\r\n      brilliancy, our now too leaden-coloured Era of Hope, and wind it\r\n      up—into fulfilment.\r\n\r\n      Great, in any case, is the felicity of the Œil-de-Bœuf.\r\n      Stinginess has fled from these royal abodes: suppression ceases;\r\n      your Besenval may go peaceably to sleep, sure that he shall awake\r\n      unplundered. Smiling Plenty, as if conjured by some enchanter,\r\n      has returned; scatters contentment from her new-flowing horn. And\r\n      mark what suavity of manners! A bland smile distinguishes our\r\n      Controller: to all men he listens with an air of interest, nay of\r\n      anticipation; makes their own wish clear to themselves, and\r\n      grants it; or at least, grants conditional promise of it. ‘I fear\r\n      this is a matter of difficulty,’ said her Majesty.—‘Madame,’\r\n      answered the Controller, ‘if it is but difficult, it is done, if\r\n      it is impossible, it shall be done (_se fera_).’ A man of such\r\n      “facility” withal. To observe him in the pleasure-vortex of\r\n      society, which none partakes of with more gusto, you might ask,\r\n      When does he work? And yet his work, as we see, is never\r\n      behindhand; above all, the fruit of his work: ready-money. Truly\r\n      a man of incredible facility; facile action, facile elocution,\r\n      facile thought: how, in mild suasion, philosophic depth sparkles\r\n      up from him, as mere wit and lambent sprightliness; and in her\r\n      Majesty’s Soirees, with the weight of a world lying on him, he is\r\n      the delight of men and women! By what magic does he accomplish\r\n      miracles? By the only true magic, that of genius. Men name him\r\n      “_the_ Minister;” as indeed, when was there another such? Crooked\r\n      things are become straight by him, rough places plain; and over\r\n      the Œil-de-Bœuf there rests an unspeakable sunshine.\r\n\r\n      Nay, in seriousness, let no man say that Calonne had not genius:\r\n      genius for Persuading; before all things, for Borrowing. With the\r\n      skilfulest judicious appliances of underhand money, he keeps the\r\n      Stock-Exchanges flourishing; so that Loan after Loan is filled up\r\n      as soon as opened. “Calculators likely to know”[51] have\r\n      calculated that he spent, in extraordinaries, “at the rate of one\r\n      million daily;” which indeed is some fifty thousand pounds\r\n      sterling: but did he not procure something with it; namely peace\r\n      and prosperity, for the time being? Philosophedom grumbles and\r\n      croaks; buys, as we said, 80,000 copies of Necker’s new Book: but\r\n      Nonpareil Calonne, in her Majesty’s Apartment, with the\r\n      glittering retinue of Dukes, Duchesses, and mere happy admiring\r\n      faces, can let Necker and Philosophedom croak.\r\n\r\n      The misery is, such a time cannot last! Squandering, and Payment\r\n      by Loan is no way to choke a Deficit. Neither is oil the\r\n      substance for quenching conflagrations;—but, only for assuaging\r\n      them, _not_ permanently! To the Nonpareil himself, who wanted not\r\n      insight, it is clear at intervals, and dimly certain at all\r\n      times, that his trade is by nature temporary, growing daily more\r\n      difficult; that changes incalculable lie at no great distance.\r\n      Apart from financial Deficit, the world is wholly in such a\r\n      new-fangled humour; all things working loose from their old\r\n      fastenings, towards new issues and combinations. There is not a\r\n      dwarf _jokei_, a cropt Brutus’-head, or Anglomaniac horseman\r\n      rising on his stirrups, that does not betoken change. But what\r\n      then? The day, in any case, passes pleasantly; for the morrow, if\r\n      the morrow come, there shall be counsel too. Once mounted (by\r\n      munificence, suasion, magic of genius) high enough in favour with\r\n      the Œil-de-Bœuf, with the King, Queen, Stock-Exchange, and so far\r\n      as possible with all men, a Nonpareil Controller may hope to go\r\n      careering through the Inevitable, in some unimagined way, as\r\n      handsomely as another.\r\n\r\n      At all events, for these three miraculous years, it has been\r\n      expedient heaped on expedient; till now, with such cumulation and\r\n      height, the pile topples perilous. And here has this\r\n      world’s-wonder of a Diamond Necklace brought it at last to the\r\n      clear verge of tumbling. Genius in that direction can no more:\r\n      mounted high enough, or not mounted, we must fare forth. Hardly\r\n      is poor Rohan, the Necklace-Cardinal, safely bestowed in the\r\n      Auvergne Mountains, Dame de Lamotte (unsafely) in the\r\n      Salpêtrière, and that mournful business hushed up, when our\r\n      sanguine Controller once more astonishes the world. An expedient,\r\n      unheard of for these hundred and sixty years, has been\r\n      propounded; and, by dint of suasion (for his light audacity, his\r\n      hope and eloquence are matchless) has been got\r\n      adopted,—_Convocation of the Notables._\r\n\r\n      Let notable persons, the actual or virtual rulers of their\r\n      districts, be summoned from all sides of France: let a true tale,\r\n      of his Majesty’s patriotic purposes and wretched pecuniary\r\n      impossibilities, be suasively told them; and then the question\r\n      put: What are we to do? Surely to adopt healing measures; such as\r\n      the magic of genius will unfold; such as, once sanctioned by\r\n      Notables, all Parlements and all men must, with more or less\r\n      reluctance, submit to.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.III.\r\n      The Notables.\r\n\r\n      Here, then is verily a sign and wonder; visible to the whole\r\n      world; bodeful of much. The Œil-de-Bœuf dolorously grumbles; were\r\n      we not well as we stood,—quenching conflagrations by oil?\r\n      Constitutional Philosophedom starts with joyful surprise; stares\r\n      eagerly what the result will be. The public creditor, the public\r\n      debtor, the whole thinking and thoughtless public have their\r\n      several surprises, joyful and sorrowful. Count Mirabeau, who has\r\n      got his matrimonial and other Lawsuits huddled up, better or\r\n      worse; and works now in the dimmest element at Berlin; compiling\r\n      _Prussian Monarchies_, Pamphlets _On Cagliostro;_ writing, with\r\n      pay, but not with honourable recognition, innumerable Despatches\r\n      for his Government,—scents or descries richer quarry from afar.\r\n      He, like an eagle or vulture, or mixture of both, preens his\r\n      wings for flight homewards.[52]\r\n\r\n      M. de Calonne has stretched out an Aaron’s Rod over France;\r\n      miraculous; and is summoning quite unexpected things. Audacity\r\n      and hope alternate in him with misgivings; though the\r\n      sanguine-valiant side carries it. Anon he writes to an intimate\r\n      friend, ‘_Je me fais pitié à moi-même_ (I am an object of pity to\r\n      myself);’ anon, invites some dedicating Poet or Poetaster to sing\r\n      “this Assembly of the Notables and the Revolution that is\r\n      preparing.”[53] Preparing indeed; and a matter to be sung,—only\r\n      not till we have _seen_ it, and what the issue of it is. In deep\r\n      obscure unrest, all things have so long gone rocking and swaying:\r\n      will M. de Calonne, with this his alchemy of the Notables, fasten\r\n      all together again, and get new revenues? Or wrench all asunder;\r\n      so that it go no longer rocking and swaying, but clashing and\r\n      colliding?\r\n\r\n      Be this as it may, in the bleak short days, we behold men of\r\n      weight and influence threading the great vortex of French\r\n      Locomotion, each on his several line, from all sides of France\r\n      towards the Château of Versailles: summoned thither _de par le\r\n      roi_. There, on the 22d day of February 1787, they have met, and\r\n      got installed: Notables to the number of a Hundred and\r\n      Thirty-seven, as we count them name by name:[54] add Seven\r\n      Princes of the Blood, it makes the round Gross of Notables. Men\r\n      of the sword, men of the robe; Peers, dignified Clergy,\r\n      Parlementary Presidents: divided into Seven Boards (_Bureaux_);\r\n      under our Seven Princes of the Blood, Monsieur, D’Artois,\r\n      Penthievre, and the rest; among whom let not our new Duke\r\n      d’Orléans (for, since 1785, he is Chartres no longer) be\r\n      forgotten. Never yet made Admiral, and now turning the corner of\r\n      his fortieth year, with spoiled blood and prospects; half-weary\r\n      of a world which is more than half-weary of him, Monseigneur’s\r\n      future is most questionable. Not in illumination and insight, not\r\n      even in conflagration; but, as was said, “in dull smoke and ashes\r\n      of outburnt sensualities,” does he live and digest. Sumptuosity\r\n      and sordidness; revenge, life-weariness, ambition, darkness,\r\n      putrescence; and, say, in sterling money, three hundred thousand\r\n      a year,—were this poor Prince once to burst loose from his\r\n      Court-moorings, to what regions, with what phenomena, might he\r\n      not sail and drift! Happily as yet he “affects to hunt daily;”\r\n      sits there, since he must sit, presiding that Bureau of his, with\r\n      dull moon-visage, dull glassy eyes, as if it were a mere tedium\r\n      to him.\r\n\r\n      We observe finally, that Count Mirabeau has actually arrived. He\r\n      descends from Berlin, on the scene of action; glares into it with\r\n      flashing sun-glance; discerns that it will do nothing for him. He\r\n      had hoped these Notables might need a Secretary. They do need\r\n      one; but have fixed on Dupont de Nemours; a man of smaller fame,\r\n      but then of better;—who indeed, as his friends often hear,\r\n      labours under this complaint, surely not a universal one, of\r\n      having “five kings to correspond with.”[55] The pen of a Mirabeau\r\n      cannot become an official one; nevertheless it remains a pen. In\r\n      defect of Secretaryship, he sets to denouncing Stock-brokerage\r\n      (_Dénonciation de l’Agiotage_); testifying, as his wont is, by\r\n      loud bruit, that he is present and busy;—till, warned by friend\r\n      Talleyrand, and even by Calonne himself underhand, that “a\r\n      seventeenth _Lettre-de-Cachet_ may be launched against him,” he\r\n      timefully flits over the marches.\r\n\r\n      And now, in stately royal apartments, as Pictures of that time\r\n      still represent them, our hundred and forty-four Notables sit\r\n      organised; ready to hear and consider. Controller Calonne is\r\n      dreadfully behindhand with his speeches, his preparatives;\r\n      however, the man’s “facility of work” is known to us. For\r\n      freshness of style, lucidity, ingenuity, largeness of view, that\r\n      opening Harangue of his was unsurpassable:—had not the\r\n      subject-matter been so appalling. A Deficit, concerning which\r\n      accounts vary, and the Controller’s own account is not\r\n      unquestioned; but which all accounts agree in representing as\r\n      “enormous.” This is the epitome of our Controller’s difficulties:\r\n      and then his means? Mere Turgotism; for thither, it seems, we\r\n      must come at last: Provincial Assemblies; new Taxation; nay,\r\n      strangest of all, new Land-tax, what he calls _Subvention\r\n      Territoriale_, from which neither Privileged nor Unprivileged,\r\n      Noblemen, Clergy, nor Parlementeers, shall be exempt!\r\n\r\n      Foolish enough! These Privileged Classes have been used to tax;\r\n      levying toll, tribute and custom, at all hands, while a penny was\r\n      left: but to be themselves taxed? Of such Privileged persons,\r\n      meanwhile, do these Notables, all but the merest fraction,\r\n      consist. Headlong Calonne had given no heed to the “composition,”\r\n      or judicious packing of them; but chosen such Notables as were\r\n      really notable; trusting for the issue to off-hand ingenuity,\r\n      good fortune, and eloquence that never yet failed. Headlong\r\n      Controller-General! Eloquence can do much, but not all. Orpheus,\r\n      with eloquence grown rhythmic, musical (what we call Poetry),\r\n      drew iron tears from the cheek of Pluto: but by what witchery of\r\n      rhyme or prose wilt thou from the pocket of Plutus draw gold?\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the storm that now rose and began to whistle round\r\n      Calonne, first in these Seven Bureaus, and then on the outside of\r\n      them, awakened by them, spreading wider and wider over all\r\n      France, threatens to become unappeasable. A Deficit so enormous!\r\n      Mismanagement, profusion is too clear. Peculation itself is\r\n      hinted at; nay, Lafayette and others go so far as to speak it\r\n      out, with attempts at proof. The blame of his Deficit our brave\r\n      Calonne, as was natural, had endeavoured to shift from himself on\r\n      his predecessors; not excepting even Necker. But now Necker\r\n      vehemently denies; whereupon an “angry Correspondence,” which\r\n      also finds its way into print.\r\n\r\n      In the Œil-de-Bœuf, and her Majesty’s private Apartments, an\r\n      eloquent Controller, with his ‘Madame, if it is but difficult,’\r\n      had been persuasive: but, alas, the cause is now carried\r\n      elsewhither. Behold him, one of these sad days, in Monsieur’s\r\n      Bureau; to which all the other Bureaus have sent deputies. He is\r\n      standing at bay: alone; exposed to an incessant fire of\r\n      questions, interpellations, objurgations, from those “hundred and\r\n      thirty-seven” pieces of logic-ordnance,—what we may well call\r\n      _bouches à feu_, fire-mouths literally! Never, according to\r\n      Besenval, or hardly ever, had such display of intellect,\r\n      dexterity, coolness, suasive eloquence, been made by man. To the\r\n      raging play of so many fire-mouths he opposes nothing angrier\r\n      than light-beams, self-possession and fatherly smiles. With the\r\n      imperturbablest bland clearness, he, for five hours long, keeps\r\n      answering the incessant volley of fiery captious questions,\r\n      reproachful interpellations; in words prompt as lightning, quiet\r\n      as light. Nay, the cross-fire too: such side questions and\r\n      incidental interpellations as, in the heat of the main-battle, he\r\n      (having only one tongue) could not get answered; these also he\r\n      takes up at the first slake; answers even these.[56] Could\r\n      blandest suasive eloquence have saved France, she were saved.\r\n\r\n      Heavy-laden Controller! In the Seven Bureaus seems nothing but\r\n      hindrance: in Monsieur’s Bureau, a Loménie de Brienne, Archbishop\r\n      of Toulouse, with an eye himself to the Controllership, stirs up\r\n      the Clergy; there are meetings, underground intrigues. Neither\r\n      from without anywhere comes sign of help or hope. For the Nation\r\n      (where Mirabeau is now, with stentor-lungs, “denouncing Agio”)\r\n      the Controller has hitherto done nothing, or less. For\r\n      Philosophedom he has done as good as nothing,—sent out some\r\n      scientific Lapérouse, or the like: and is he not in “angry\r\n      correspondence” with its Necker? The very Œil-de-Bœuf looks\r\n      questionable; a falling Controller has no friends. Solid M. de\r\n      Vergennes, who with his phlegmatic judicious punctuality might\r\n      have kept down many things, died the very week before these\r\n      sorrowful Notables met. And now a Seal-keeper, _Garde-des-Sceaux_\r\n      Miroménil is thought to be playing the traitor: spinning plots\r\n      for Loménie-Brienne! Queen’s-Reader Abbé de Vermond, unloved\r\n      individual, was Brienne’s creature, the work of his hands from\r\n      the first: it may be feared the backstairs passage is open,\r\n      ground getting mined under our feet. Treacherous Garde-des-Sceaux\r\n      Miroménil, at least, should be dismissed; Lamoignon, the eloquent\r\n      Notable, a stanch man, with connections, and even ideas,\r\n      Parlement-President yet intent on reforming Parlements, were not\r\n      he the right Keeper? So, for one, thinks busy Besenval; and, at\r\n      dinner-table, rounds the same into the Controller’s ear,—who\r\n      always, in the intervals of landlord-duties, listens to him as\r\n      with charmed look, but answers nothing positive.[57]\r\n\r\n      Alas, what to answer? The force of private intrigue, and then\r\n      also the force of public opinion, grows so dangerous, confused!\r\n      Philosophedom sneers aloud, as if its Necker already triumphed.\r\n      The gaping populace gapes over Wood-cuts or Copper-cuts; where,\r\n      for example, a Rustic is represented convoking the poultry of his\r\n      barnyard, with this opening address: ‘Dear animals, I have\r\n      assembled you to advise me what sauce I shall dress you with;’ to\r\n      which a Cock responding, ‘We don’t want to be eaten,’ is checked\r\n      by ‘You wander from the point (_Vous vous écartez de la\r\n      question_).’[58] Laughter and logic; ballad-singer, pamphleteer;\r\n      epigram and caricature: what wind of public opinion is this,—as\r\n      if the Cave of the Winds were bursting loose! At nightfall,\r\n      President Lamoignon steals over to the Controller’s; finds him\r\n      “walking with large strides in his chamber, like one out of\r\n      himself.”[59] With rapid confused speech the Controller begs M.\r\n      de Lamoignon to give him “an advice.” Lamoignon candidly answers\r\n      that, except in regard to his own anticipated Keepership, unless\r\n      that would prove remedial, he really cannot take upon him to\r\n      advise.\r\n\r\n      “On the Monday after Easter,” the 9th of April 1787, a date one\r\n      rejoices to verify, for nothing can excel the indolent falsehood\r\n      of these _Histoires and Mémoires_,—“On the Monday after Easter,\r\n      as I, Besenval, was riding towards Romainville to the Maréchal de\r\n      Segur’s, I met a friend on the Boulevards, who told me that M. de\r\n      Calonne was out. A little further on came M. the Duke d’Orléans,\r\n      dashing towards me, head to the wind” (trotting _à l’Anglaise_),\r\n      “and confirmed the news.”[60] It is true news. Treacherous\r\n      Garde-des-Sceaux Miroménil is gone, and Lamoignon is appointed in\r\n      his room: but appointed for his own profit only, not for the\r\n      Controller’s: “next day” the Controller also has had to move. A\r\n      little longer he may linger near; be seen among the money\r\n      changers, and even “working in the Controller’s office,” where\r\n      much lies unfinished: but neither will that hold. Too strong\r\n      blows and beats this tempest of public opinion, of private\r\n      intrigue, as from the Cave of all the Winds; and blows him\r\n      (higher Authority giving sign) out of Paris and France,—over the\r\n      horizon, into Invisibility, or outer Darkness.\r\n\r\n      Such destiny the magic of genius could not forever avert.\r\n      Ungrateful Œil-de-Bœuf! did he not miraculously rain gold manna\r\n      on you; so that, as a Courtier said, ‘All the world held out its\r\n      hand, and I held out my hat,’—for a time? Himself is poor;\r\n      penniless, had not a “Financier’s widow in Lorraine” offered him,\r\n      though he was turned of fifty, her hand and the rich purse it\r\n      held. Dim henceforth shall be his activity, though unwearied:\r\n      Letters to the King, Appeals, Prognostications; Pamphlets (from\r\n      London), written with the old suasive facility; which however do\r\n      not persuade. Luckily his widow’s purse fails not. Once, in a\r\n      year or two, some shadow of him shall be seen hovering on the\r\n      Northern Border, seeking election as National Deputy; but be\r\n      sternly beckoned away. Dimmer then, far-borne over utmost\r\n      European lands, in uncertain twilight of diplomacy, he shall\r\n      hover, intriguing for “Exiled Princes,” and have adventures; be\r\n      overset into the Rhine stream and half-drowned, nevertheless save\r\n      his papers dry. Unwearied, but in vain! In France he works\r\n      miracles no more; shall hardly return thither to find a grave.\r\n      Farewell, thou facile sanguine Controller-General, with thy light\r\n      rash hand, thy suasive mouth of gold: worse men there have been,\r\n      and better; but to thee also was allotted a task,—of raising the\r\n      wind, and the winds; and thou hast done it.\r\n\r\n      But now, while Ex-Controller Calonne flies storm-driven over the\r\n      horizon, in this singular way, what has become of the\r\n      Controllership? It hangs vacant, one may say; extinct, like the\r\n      Moon in her vacant interlunar cave. Two preliminary shadows, poor\r\n      M. Fourqueux, poor M. Villedeuil, do hold in quick succession\r\n      some simulacrum of it,[61]—as the new Moon will sometimes shine\r\n      out with a dim preliminary old one in her arms. Be patient, ye\r\n      Notables! An actual new Controller is certain, and even ready;\r\n      were the indispensable manœuvres but gone through. Long-headed\r\n      Lamoignon, with Home Secretary Bréteuil, and Foreign Secretary\r\n      Montmorin have exchanged looks; let these three once meet and\r\n      speak. Who is it that is strong in the Queen’s favour, and the\r\n      Abbé de Vermond’s? That is a man of great capacity? Or at least\r\n      that has struggled, these fifty years, to have it thought great;\r\n      now, in the Clergy’s name, demanding to have Protestant\r\n      death-penalties “put in execution;” no flaunting it in the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf, as the gayest man-pleaser and woman-pleaser;\r\n      gleaning even a good word from Philosophedom and your Voltaires\r\n      and D’Alemberts? With a party ready-made for him in the\r\n      Notables?—Loménie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse! answer all\r\n      the three, with the clearest instantaneous concord; and rush off\r\n      to propose him to the King; “in such haste,” says Besenval, “that\r\n      M. de Lamoignon had to borrow a _simarre_,” seemingly some kind\r\n      of cloth apparatus necessary for that.[62]\r\n\r\n      Loménie-Brienne, who had all his life “felt a kind of\r\n      predestination for the highest offices,” has now therefore\r\n      obtained them. He presides over the Finances; he shall have the\r\n      title of Prime Minister itself, and the effort of his long life\r\n      be realised. Unhappy only that it took such talent and industry\r\n      to _gain_ the place; that to _qualify_ for it hardly any talent\r\n      or industry was left disposable! Looking now into his inner man,\r\n      what qualification he may have, Loménie beholds, not without\r\n      astonishment, next to nothing but vacuity and possibility.\r\n      Principles or methods, acquirement outward or inward (for his\r\n      very body is wasted, by hard tear and wear) he finds none; not so\r\n      much as a plan, even an unwise one. Lucky, in these\r\n      circumstances, that Calonne has had a plan! Calonne’s plan was\r\n      gathered from Turgot’s and Necker’s by compilation; shall become\r\n      Loménie’s by adoption. Not in vain has Loménie studied the\r\n      working of the British Constitution; for he professes to have\r\n      some Anglomania, of a sort. Why, in that free country, does one\r\n      Minister, driven out by Parliament, vanish from his King’s\r\n      presence, and another enter, borne in by Parliament?[63] Surely\r\n      not for mere change (which is ever wasteful); but that all men\r\n      may have share of what is going; and so the strife of Freedom\r\n      indefinitely prolong itself, and no harm be done.\r\n\r\n      The Notables, mollified by Easter festivities, by the sacrifice\r\n      of Calonne, are not in the worst humour. Already his Majesty,\r\n      while the “interlunar shadows” were in office, had held session\r\n      of Notables; and from his throne delivered promissory\r\n      conciliatory eloquence: “The Queen stood waiting at a window,\r\n      till his carriage came back; and Monsieur from afar clapped hands\r\n      to her,” in sign that all was well.[64] It has had the best\r\n      effect; if such do but last. Leading Notables meanwhile can be\r\n      “caressed;” Brienne’s new gloss, Lamoignon’s long head will\r\n      profit somewhat; conciliatory eloquence shall not be wanting. On\r\n      the whole, however, is it not undeniable that this of ousting\r\n      Calonne and adopting the plans of Calonne, is a measure which, to\r\n      produce its best effect, should be looked at from a certain\r\n      distance, cursorily; not dwelt on with minute near scrutiny. In a\r\n      word, that no service the Notables could now do were so obliging\r\n      as, in some handsome manner, to—take themselves away! Their “Six\r\n      Propositions” about Provisional Assemblies, suppression of\r\n      _Corvées_ and suchlike, can be accepted without criticism. The\r\n      _Subvention_ on Land-tax, and much else, one must glide hastily\r\n      over; safe nowhere but in flourishes of conciliatory eloquence.\r\n      Till at length, on this 25th of May, year 1787, in solemn final\r\n      session, there bursts forth what we can call an explosion of\r\n      eloquence; King, Loménie, Lamoignon and retinue taking up the\r\n      successive strain; in harrangues to the number of ten, besides\r\n      his Majesty’s, which last the livelong day;—whereby, as in a kind\r\n      of choral anthem, or bravura peal, of thanks, praises, promises,\r\n      the Notables are, so to speak, organed out, and dismissed to\r\n      their respective places of abode. They had sat, and talked, some\r\n      nine weeks: they were the first Notables since Richelieu’s, in\r\n      the year 1626.\r\n\r\n      By some Historians, sitting much at their ease, in the safe\r\n      distance, Loménie has been blamed for this dismissal of his\r\n      Notables: nevertheless it was clearly time. There are things, as\r\n      we said, which should not be dwelt on with minute close scrutiny:\r\n      over hot coals you cannot glide too fast. In these Seven Bureaus,\r\n      where no work could be done, unless talk were work, the\r\n      questionablest matters were coming up. Lafayette, for example, in\r\n      Monseigneur d’Artois’ Bureau, took upon him to set forth more\r\n      than one deprecatory oration about _Lettres-de-Cachet_, Liberty\r\n      of the Subject, _Agio_, and suchlike; which Monseigneur\r\n      endeavouring to repress, was answered that a Notable being\r\n      summoned to speak his opinion must speak it.[65]\r\n\r\n      Thus too his Grace the Archbishop of Aix perorating once, with a\r\n      plaintive pulpit tone, in these words? ‘Tithe, that free-will\r\n      offering of the piety of Christians’—‘Tithe,’ interrupted Duke la\r\n      Rochefoucault, with the cold business-manner he has learned from\r\n      the English, ‘that free-will offering of the piety of Christians;\r\n      on which there are now forty-thousand lawsuits in this\r\n      realm.’[66] Nay, Lafayette, bound to speak his opinion, went the\r\n      length, one day, of proposing to convoke a “National Assembly.”\r\n      ‘You demand States-General?’ asked Monseigneur with an air of\r\n      minatory surprise.—‘Yes, Monseigneur; and even better than\r\n      that.’—‘Write it,’ said Monseigneur to the Clerks.[67]—Written\r\n      accordingly it is; and what is more, will be acted by and by.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.IV.\r\n      Loménie’s Edicts.\r\n\r\n      Thus, then, have the Notables returned home; carrying to all\r\n      quarters of France, such notions of deficit, decrepitude,\r\n      distraction; and that States-General will cure it, or will not\r\n      cure it but kill it. Each Notable, we may fancy, is as a funeral\r\n      torch; disclosing hideous abysses, better left hid! The\r\n      unquietest humour possesses all men; ferments, seeks issue, in\r\n      pamphleteering, caricaturing, projecting, declaiming; vain\r\n      jangling of thought, word and deed.\r\n\r\n      It is Spiritual Bankruptcy, long tolerated; verging now towards\r\n      Economical Bankruptcy, and become intolerable. For from the\r\n      lowest dumb rank, the inevitable misery, as was predicted, has\r\n      spread upwards. In every man is some obscure feeling that his\r\n      position, oppressive or else oppressed, is a false one: all men,\r\n      in one or the other acrid dialect, as assaulters or as defenders,\r\n      must give vent to the unrest that is in them. Of such stuff\r\n      national well-being, and the glory of rulers, is not made. O\r\n      Loménie, what a wild-heaving, waste-looking, hungry and angry\r\n      world hast thou, after lifelong effort, got promoted to take\r\n      charge of!\r\n\r\n      Loménie’s first Edicts are mere soothing ones: creation of\r\n      Provincial Assemblies, “for apportioning the imposts,” when we\r\n      get any; suppression of _Corvées_ or statute-labour; alleviation\r\n      of _Gabelle_. Soothing measures, recommended by the Notables;\r\n      long clamoured for by all liberal men. Oil cast on the waters has\r\n      been known to produce a good effect. Before venturing with great\r\n      essential measures, Loménie will see this singular “swell of the\r\n      public mind” abate somewhat.\r\n\r\n      Most proper, surely. But what if it were not a swell of the\r\n      abating kind? There are swells that come of upper tempest and\r\n      wind-gust. But again there are swells that come of subterranean\r\n      pent wind, some say; and even of inward decomposition, of decay\r\n      that has become self-combustion:—as when, according to\r\n      Neptuno-Plutonic Geology, the World is all decayed down into due\r\n      attritus of this sort; and shall now be _exploded_, and new-made!\r\n      These latter abate not by oil.—The fool says in his heart, How\r\n      shall not tomorrow be as yesterday; as all days,—which were once\r\n      tomorrows? The wise man, looking on this France, moral,\r\n      intellectual, economical, sees, “in short, all the symptoms he\r\n      has ever met with in history,”—unabatable by soothing Edicts.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, abate or not, cash must be had; and for that quite\r\n      another sort of Edicts, namely “bursal” or fiscal ones. How easy\r\n      were fiscal Edicts, did you know for certain that the Parlement\r\n      of Paris would what they call “register” them! Such right of\r\n      registering, properly of mere _writing down_, the Parlement has\r\n      got by old wont; and, though but a Law-Court, can remonstrate,\r\n      and higgle considerably about the same. Hence many quarrels;\r\n      desperate Maupeou devices, and victory and defeat;—a quarrel now\r\n      near forty years long. Hence fiscal Edicts, which otherwise were\r\n      easy enough, become such problems. For example, is there not\r\n      Calonne’s _Subvention Territoriale_, universal, unexempting\r\n      Land-tax; the sheet-anchor of Finance? Or, to show, so far as\r\n      possible, that one is not without original finance talent,\r\n      Loménie himself can devise an _Edit du Timbre_ or\r\n      Stamp-tax,—borrowed also, it is true; but then from America: may\r\n      it prove luckier in France than there!\r\n\r\n      France has her resources: nevertheless, it cannot be denied, the\r\n      aspect of that Parlement is questionable. Already among the\r\n      Notables, in that final symphony of dismissal, the Paris\r\n      President had an ominous tone. Adrien Duport, quitting magnetic\r\n      sleep, in this agitation of the world, threatens to rouse himself\r\n      into preternatural wakefulness. Shallower but also louder, there\r\n      is magnetic D’Espréménil, with his tropical heat (he was born at\r\n      Madras); with his dusky confused violence; holding of\r\n      Illumination, Animal Magnetism, Public Opinion, Adam Weisshaupt,\r\n      Harmodius and Aristogiton, and all manner of confused violent\r\n      things: of whom can come no good. The very Peerage is infected\r\n      with the leaven. Our Peers have, in too many cases, laid aside\r\n      their frogs, laces, bagwigs; and go about in English costume, or\r\n      ride rising in their stirrups,—in the most headlong manner;\r\n      nothing but insubordination, eleutheromania, confused unlimited\r\n      opposition in their heads. Questionable: not to be ventured upon,\r\n      if we had a Fortunatus’ Purse! But Loménie has waited all June,\r\n      casting on the waters what oil he had; and now, betide as it may,\r\n      the two Finance Edicts must out. On the 6th of July, he forwards\r\n      his proposed Stamp-tax and Land-tax to the Parlement of Paris;\r\n      and, as if putting his own leg foremost, not his borrowed\r\n      Calonne’s-leg, places the Stamp-tax first in order.\r\n\r\n      Alas, the Parlement will _not_ register: the Parlement demands\r\n      instead a “state of the expenditure,” a “state of the\r\n      contemplated reductions;” “states” enough; which his Majesty must\r\n      decline to furnish! Discussions arise; patriotic eloquence: the\r\n      Peers are summoned. Does the Nemean Lion begin to bristle? Here\r\n      surely is a duel, which France and the Universe may look upon:\r\n      with prayers; at lowest, with curiosity and bets. Paris stirs\r\n      with new animation. The outer courts of the Palais de Justice\r\n      roll with unusual crowds, coming and going; their huge outer hum\r\n      mingles with the clang of patriotic eloquence within, and gives\r\n      vigour to it. Poor Loménie gazes from the distance, little\r\n      comforted; has his invisible emissaries flying to and fro,\r\n      assiduous, without result.\r\n\r\n      So pass the sultry dog-days, in the most electric manner; and the\r\n      whole month of July. And still, in the Sanctuary of Justice,\r\n      sounds nothing but Harmodius-Aristogiton eloquence, environed\r\n      with the hum of crowding Paris; and no registering accomplished,\r\n      and no “states” furnished. ‘States?’ said a lively Parlementeer:\r\n      ‘Messieurs, the states that should be furnished us, in my opinion\r\n      are the STATES-GENERAL.’ On which timely joke there follow\r\n      cachinnatory buzzes of approval. What a word to be spoken in the\r\n      Palais de Justice! Old D’Ormesson (the Ex-Controller’s uncle)\r\n      shakes his judicious head; far enough from laughing. But the\r\n      outer courts, and Paris and France, catch the glad sound, and\r\n      repeat it; shall repeat it, and re-echo and reverberate it, till\r\n      it grow a deafening peal. Clearly enough here is no registering\r\n      to be thought of.\r\n\r\n      The pious Proverb says, “There are remedies for all things but\r\n      death.” When a Parlement refuses registering, the remedy, by long\r\n      practice, has become familiar to the simplest: a Bed of Justice.\r\n      One complete month this Parlement has spent in mere idle\r\n      jargoning, and sound and fury; the _Timbre_ Edict not registered,\r\n      or like to be; the _Subvention_ not yet so much as spoken of. On\r\n      the 6th of August let the whole refractory Body roll out, in\r\n      wheeled vehicles, as far as the King’s Château of Versailles;\r\n      there shall the King, holding his Bed of Justice, _order_ them,\r\n      by his own royal lips, to register. They may remonstrate, in an\r\n      under tone; but they must obey, lest a worse unknown thing befall\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      It is done: the Parlement has rolled out, on royal summons; has\r\n      heard the express royal order to register. Whereupon it has\r\n      rolled back again, amid the hushed expectancy of men. And now,\r\n      behold, on the morrow, this Parlement, seated once more in its\r\n      own Palais, with “crowds inundating the outer courts,” not only\r\n      does not register, but (O portent!) declares all that was done on\r\n      the prior day to be _null_, and the Bed of Justice as good as a\r\n      futility! In the history of France here verily is a new feature.\r\n      Nay better still, our heroic Parlement, getting suddenly\r\n      enlightened on several things, declares that, for its part, it is\r\n      incompetent to register Tax-edicts at all,—having done it by\r\n      mistake, during these late centuries; that for such act one\r\n      authority only is competent: the assembled Three Estates of the\r\n      Realm!\r\n\r\n      To such length can the universal spirit of a Nation penetrate the\r\n      most isolated Body-corporate: say rather, with such weapons,\r\n      homicidal and suicidal, in exasperated political duel, will\r\n      Bodies-corporate fight! But, in any case, is not this the real\r\n      death-grapple of war and internecine duel, Greek meeting Greek;\r\n      whereon men, had they even no interest in it, might look with\r\n      interest unspeakable? Crowds, as was said, inundate the outer\r\n      courts: inundation of young eleutheromaniac Noblemen in English\r\n      costume, uttering audacious speeches; of Procureurs,\r\n      Basoche-Clerks, who are idle in these days: of Loungers,\r\n      Newsmongers and other nondescript classes,—rolls tumultuous\r\n      there. “From three to four thousand persons,” waiting eagerly to\r\n      hear the _Arrêtés_ (Resolutions) you arrive at within; applauding\r\n      with bravos, with the clapping of from six to eight thousand\r\n      hands! Sweet also is the meed of patriotic eloquence, when your\r\n      D’Espréménil, your Fréteau, or Sabatier, issuing from his\r\n      Demosthenic Olympus, the thunder being hushed for the day, is\r\n      welcomed, in the outer courts, with a shout from four thousand\r\n      throats; is borne home shoulder-high “with benedictions,” and\r\n      strikes the stars with his sublime head.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.V.\r\n      Loménie’s Thunderbolts.\r\n\r\n      Arise, Loménie-Brienne: here is no case for “Letters of Jussion;”\r\n      for faltering or compromise. Thou seest the whole loose _fluent_\r\n      population of Paris (whatsoever is not solid, and fixed to work)\r\n      inundating these outer courts, like a loud destructive deluge;\r\n      the very Basoche of Lawyers’ Clerks talks sedition. The lower\r\n      classes, in this duel of Authority with Authority, Greek\r\n      throttling Greek, have ceased to respect the City-Watch:\r\n      Police-satellites are marked on the back with chalk (the M\r\n      signifies _mouchard_, spy); they are hustled, hunted like _feræ\r\n      naturæ_. Subordinate rural Tribunals send messengers of\r\n      congratulation, of adherence. Their Fountain of Justice is\r\n      becoming a Fountain of Revolt. The Provincial Parlements look on,\r\n      with intent eye, with breathless wishes, while their elder sister\r\n      of Paris does battle: the whole Twelve are of one blood and\r\n      temper; the victory of one is that of all.\r\n\r\n      Ever worse it grows: on the 10th of August, there is “_Plainte_”\r\n      emitted touching the “prodigalities of Calonne,” and permission\r\n      to “proceed” against him. No registering, but instead of it,\r\n      denouncing: of dilapidation, peculation; and ever the burden of\r\n      the song, States-General! Have the royal armories no thunderbolt,\r\n      that thou couldst, O Loménie, with red right-hand, launch it\r\n      among these Demosthenic theatrical thunder-barrels, mere resin\r\n      and noise for most part;—and shatter, and smite them silent? On\r\n      the night of the 14th of August, Loménie launches his\r\n      thunderbolt, or handful of them. Letters named of the Seal (_de\r\n      Cachet_), as many as needful, some sixscore and odd, are\r\n      delivered overnight. And so, next day betimes, the whole\r\n      Parlement, once more set on wheels, is rolling incessantly\r\n      towards Troyes in Champagne; “escorted,” says History, “with the\r\n      blessings of all people;” the very innkeepers and postillions\r\n      looking gratuitously reverent.[68] This is the 15th of August\r\n      1787.\r\n\r\n      What will not people bless; in their extreme need? Seldom had the\r\n      Parlement of Paris deserved much blessing, or received much. An\r\n      isolated Body-corporate, which, out of old confusions (while the\r\n      Sceptre of the Sword was confusedly struggling to become a\r\n      Sceptre of the Pen), had got itself together, better and worse,\r\n      as Bodies-corporate do, to satisfy some dim desire of the world,\r\n      and many clear desires of individuals; and so had grown, in the\r\n      course of centuries, on concession, on acquirement and\r\n      usurpation, to be what we see it: a prosperous social Anomaly,\r\n      deciding Lawsuits, sanctioning or rejecting Laws; and withal\r\n      disposing of its places and offices by sale for ready\r\n      money,—which method sleek President Hénault, after meditation,\r\n      will demonstrate to be the indifferent-best.[69]\r\n\r\n      In such a Body, existing by purchase for ready-money, there could\r\n      not be excess of public spirit; there might well be excess of\r\n      eagerness to divide the public spoil. Men in helmets have divided\r\n      that, with swords; men in wigs, with quill and inkhorn, do divide\r\n      it: and even more hatefully these latter, if more peaceably; for\r\n      the wig-method is at once irresistibler and baser. By long\r\n      experience, says Besenval, it has been found useless to sue a\r\n      Parlementeer at law; no Officer of Justice will serve a writ on\r\n      one; his wig and gown are his Vulcan’s-panoply, his enchanted\r\n      cloak-of-darkness.\r\n\r\n      The Parlement of Paris may count itself an unloved body; mean,\r\n      not magnanimous, on the political side. Were the King weak,\r\n      always (as now) has his Parlement barked, cur-like at his heels;\r\n      with what popular cry there might be. Were he strong, it barked\r\n      before his face; hunting for him as his alert beagle. An unjust\r\n      Body; where foul influences have more than once worked shameful\r\n      perversion of judgment. Does not, in these very days, the blood\r\n      of murdered Lally cry aloud for vengeance? Baited, circumvented,\r\n      driven mad like the snared lion, Valour had to sink extinguished\r\n      under vindictive Chicane. Behold him, that hapless Lally, his\r\n      wild dark soul looking through his wild dark face; trailed on the\r\n      ignominious death-hurdle; the voice of his despair choked by a\r\n      wooden gag! The wild fire-soul that has known only peril and\r\n      toil; and, for threescore years, has buffeted against Fate’s\r\n      obstruction and men’s perfidy, like genius and courage amid\r\n      poltroonery, dishonesty and commonplace; faithfully enduring and\r\n      endeavouring,—O Parlement of Paris, dost thou reward it with a\r\n      gibbet and a gag?[70] The dying Lally bequeathed his memory to\r\n      his boy; a young Lally has arisen, demanding redress in the name\r\n      of God and man. The Parlement of Paris does its utmost to defend\r\n      the indefensible, abominable; nay, what is singular,\r\n      dusky-glowing Aristogiton d’Espréménil is the man chosen to be\r\n      its spokesman in that.\r\n\r\n      Such Social Anomaly is it that France now blesses. An unclean\r\n      Social Anomaly; but in duel against another worse! The exiled\r\n      Parlement is felt to have “covered itself with glory.” There are\r\n      quarrels in which even Satan, bringing help, were not unwelcome;\r\n      even Satan, fighting stiffly, might cover himself with glory,—of\r\n      a temporary sort.\r\n\r\n      But what a stir in the outer courts of the Palais, when Paris\r\n      finds its Parlement trundled off to Troyes in Champagne; and\r\n      nothing left but a few mute Keepers of records; the Demosthenic\r\n      thunder become extinct, the martyrs of liberty clean gone!\r\n      Confused wail and menace rises from the four thousand throats of\r\n      Procureurs, Basoche-Clerks, Nondescripts, and Anglomaniac\r\n      Noblesse; ever new idlers crowd to see and hear; Rascality, with\r\n      increasing numbers and vigour, hunts _mouchards_. Loud whirlpool\r\n      rolls through these spaces; the rest of the City, fixed to its\r\n      work, cannot yet go rolling. Audacious placards are legible, in\r\n      and about the Palais, the speeches are as good as seditious.\r\n      Surely the temper of Paris is much changed. On the third day of\r\n      this business (18th of August), Monsieur and Monseigneur\r\n      d’Artois, coming in state-carriages, according to use and wont,\r\n      to have these late obnoxious _Arrêtés_ and protests “expunged”\r\n      from the Records, are received in the most marked manner.\r\n      Monsieur, who is thought to be in opposition, is met with vivats\r\n      and strewed flowers; Monseigneur, on the other hand, with\r\n      silence; with murmurs, which rise to hisses and groans; nay, an\r\n      irreverent Rascality presses towards him in floods, with such\r\n      hissing vehemence, that the Captain of the Guards has to give\r\n      order, ‘_Haut les armes_ (Handle arms)!’—at which thunder-word,\r\n      indeed, and the flash of the clear iron, the Rascal-flood\r\n      recoils, through all avenues, fast enough.[71] New features\r\n      these. Indeed, as good M. de Malesherbes pertinently remarks, ‘it\r\n      is a quite new kind of contest this with the Parlement:’ no\r\n      transitory sputter, as from collision of hard bodies; but more\r\n      like ‘the first sparks of what, if not quenched, may become a\r\n      great conflagration.’[72]\r\n\r\n      This good Malesherbes sees himself now again in the King’s\r\n      Council, after an absence of ten years: Loménie would profit if\r\n      not by the faculties of the man, yet by the name he has. As for\r\n      the man’s opinion, it is not listened to;—wherefore he will soon\r\n      withdraw, a second time; back to his books and his trees. In such\r\n      King’s Council what can a good man profit? Turgot tries it not a\r\n      second time: Turgot has quitted France and this Earth, some years\r\n      ago; and now cares for none of these things. Singular enough:\r\n      Turgot, this same Loménie, and the Abbé Morellet were once a trio\r\n      of young friends; fellow-scholars in the Sorbonne. Forty new\r\n      years have carried them severally thus far.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile the Parlement sits daily at Troyes, calling cases; and\r\n      daily adjourns, no Procureur making his appearance to plead.\r\n      Troyes is as hospitable as could be looked for: nevertheless one\r\n      has comparatively a dull life. No crowds now to carry you,\r\n      shoulder-high, to the immortal gods; scarcely a Patriot or two\r\n      will drive out so far, and bid you be of firm courage. You are in\r\n      furnished lodgings, far from home and domestic comfort: little to\r\n      do, but wander over the unlovely Champagne fields; seeing the\r\n      grapes ripen; taking counsel about the thousand-times consulted:\r\n      a prey to tedium; in danger even that Paris may forget you.\r\n      Messengers come and go: pacific Loménie is not slack in\r\n      negotiating, promising; D’Ormesson and the prudent elder Members\r\n      see no good in strife.\r\n\r\n      After a dull month, the Parlement, yielding and retaining, makes\r\n      truce, as all Parlements must. The Stamp-tax is withdrawn: the\r\n      _Subvention_ Land-tax is also withdrawn; but, in its stead, there\r\n      is granted, what they call a “Prorogation of the Second\r\n      Twentieth,”—itself a kind of Land-tax, but not so oppressive to\r\n      the Influential classes; which lies mainly on the Dumb class.\r\n      Moreover, secret promises exist (on the part of the Elders), that\r\n      finances may be raised by Loan. Of the ugly word States-General\r\n      there shall be no mention.\r\n\r\n      And so, on the 20th of September, our exiled Parlement returns:\r\n      D’Espréménil said, “it went out covered with glory, but had come\r\n      back covered with mud (_de boue_).” Not so, Aristogiton; or if\r\n      so, thou surely art the man to clean it.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.VI.\r\n      Loménie’s Plots.\r\n\r\n      Was ever unfortunate Chief Minister so bested as Loménie-Brienne?\r\n      The reins of the State fairly in his hand these six months; and\r\n      not the smallest motive-power (of Finance) to stir from the spot\r\n      with, this way or that! He flourishes his whip, but advances not.\r\n      Instead of ready-money, there is nothing but rebellious debating\r\n      and recalcitrating.\r\n\r\n      Far is the public mind from having calmed; it goes chafing and\r\n      fuming ever worse: and in the royal coffers, with such yearly\r\n      Deficit running on, there is hardly the colour of coin. Ominous\r\n      prognostics! Malesherbes, seeing an exhausted, exasperated France\r\n      grow hotter and hotter, talks of “conflagration:” Mirabeau,\r\n      without talk, has, as we perceive, descended on Paris again,\r\n      close on the rear of the Parlement,[73]—not to quit his native\r\n      soil any more.\r\n\r\n      Over the Frontiers, behold Holland invaded by Prussia;[74] the\r\n      French party oppressed, England and the Stadtholder triumphing:\r\n      to the sorrow of War-Secretary Montmorin and all men. But without\r\n      money, sinews of war, as of work, and of existence itself, what\r\n      can a Chief Minister do? Taxes profit little: this of the Second\r\n      Twentieth falls not due till next year; and will then, with its\r\n      “strict valuation,” produce more controversy than cash. Taxes on\r\n      the Privileged Classes cannot be got registered; are intolerable\r\n      to our supporters themselves: taxes on the Unprivileged yield\r\n      nothing,—as from a thing drained dry more cannot be drawn. Hope\r\n      is nowhere, if not in the old refuge of Loans.\r\n\r\n      To Loménie, aided by the long head of Lamoignon, deeply pondering\r\n      this sea of troubles, the thought suggested itself: Why not have\r\n      a Successive Loan (_Emprunt Successif_), or Loan that went on\r\n      lending, year after year, as much as needful; say, till 1792? The\r\n      trouble of registering such Loan were the same: we had then\r\n      breathing time; money to work with, at least to subsist on. Edict\r\n      of a Successive Loan must be proposed. To conciliate the\r\n      Philosophes, let a liberal Edict walk in front of it, for\r\n      emancipation of Protestants; let a liberal Promise guard the rear\r\n      of it, that when our Loan ends, in that final 1792, the\r\n      States-General shall be convoked.\r\n\r\n      Such liberal Edict of Protestant Emancipation, the time having\r\n      come for it, shall cost a Loménie as little as the\r\n      “Death-penalties to be put in execution” did. As for the liberal\r\n      Promise, of States-General, it can be fulfilled or not: the\r\n      fulfilment is five good years off; in five years much intervenes.\r\n      But the registering? Ah, truly, there is the difficulty!—However,\r\n      we have that promise of the Elders, given secretly at Troyes.\r\n      Judicious gratuities, cajoleries, underground intrigues, with old\r\n      Foulon, named “_Ame damnée_, Familiar-demon, of the Parlement,”\r\n      may perhaps do the rest. At worst and lowest, the Royal Authority\r\n      has resources,—which ought it not to put forth? If it cannot\r\n      realise money, the Royal Authority is as good as dead; dead of\r\n      that surest and miserablest death, inanition. Risk and win;\r\n      without risk all is already lost! For the rest, as in enterprises\r\n      of pith, a touch of stratagem often proves furthersome, his\r\n      Majesty announces _a Royal Hunt_, for the 19th of November next;\r\n      and all whom it concerns are joyfully getting their gear ready.\r\n\r\n      Royal Hunt indeed; but of two-legged unfeathered game! At eleven\r\n      in the morning of that Royal-Hunt day, 19th of November 1787,\r\n      unexpected blare of trumpetting, tumult of charioteering and\r\n      cavalcading disturbs the Seat of Justice: his Majesty is come,\r\n      with Garde-des-Sceaux Lamoignon, and Peers and retinue, to hold\r\n      Royal Session and have Edicts registered. What a change, since\r\n      Louis XIV. entered here, in boots; and, whip in hand, ordered his\r\n      registering to be done,—with an Olympian look which none durst\r\n      gainsay; and did, without stratagem, in such unceremonious\r\n      fashion, hunt as well as register![75] For Louis XVI., on this\r\n      day, the Registering will be enough; if indeed he and the day\r\n      suffice for it.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, with fit ceremonial words, the purpose of the royal\r\n      breast is signified:—Two Edicts, for Protestant Emancipation, for\r\n      Successive Loan: of both which Edicts our trusty Garde-des-Sceaux\r\n      Lamoignon will explain the purport; on both which a trusty\r\n      Parlement is requested to deliver its opinion, each member having\r\n      free privilege of speech. And so, Lamoignon too having perorated\r\n      not amiss, and wound up with that Promise of States-General,—the\r\n      Sphere-music of Parlementary eloquence begins. Explosive,\r\n      responsive, sphere answering sphere, it waxes louder and louder.\r\n      The Peers sit attentive; of diverse sentiment: unfriendly to\r\n      States-General; unfriendly to Despotism, which cannot reward\r\n      merit, and is suppressing places. But what agitates his Highness\r\n      d’Orléans? The rubicund moon-head goes wagging; darker beams the\r\n      copper visage, like unscoured copper; in the glazed eye is\r\n      disquietude; he rolls uneasy in his seat, as if he meant\r\n      something. Amid unutterable satiety, has sudden new appetite, for\r\n      new forbidden fruit, been vouchsafed him? Disgust and edacity;\r\n      laziness that cannot rest; futile ambition, revenge,\r\n      non-admiralship:—O, within that carbuncled skin what a confusion\r\n      of confusions sits bottled!\r\n\r\n      “Eight Couriers,” in course of the day, gallop from Versailles,\r\n      where Loménie waits palpitating; and gallop back again, not with\r\n      the best news. In the outer Courts of the Palais, huge buzz of\r\n      expectation reigns; it is whispered the Chief Minister has lost\r\n      six votes overnight. And from within, resounds nothing but\r\n      forensic eloquence, pathetic and even indignant; heartrending\r\n      appeals to the royal clemency, that his Majesty would please to\r\n      summon States-General forthwith, and be the Saviour of\r\n      France:—wherein dusky-glowing D’Espréménil, but still more\r\n      Sabatier de Cabre, and Fréteau, since named _Commère_ Fréteau\r\n      (Goody Fréteau), are among the loudest. For six mortal hours it\r\n      lasts, in this manner; the infinite hubbub unslackened.\r\n\r\n      And so now, when brown dusk is falling through the windows, and\r\n      no end visible, his Majesty, on hint of Garde-des-Sceaux,\r\n      Lamoignon, opens his royal lips once more to say, in brief That\r\n      he must have his Loan-Edict registered.—Momentary deep\r\n      pause!—See! Monseigneur d’Orléans rises; with moon-visage turned\r\n      towards the royal platform, he asks, with a delicate graciosity\r\n      of manner covering unutterable things: ‘Whether it is a Bed of\r\n      Justice, then; or a Royal Session?’ Fire flashes on him from the\r\n      throne and neighbourhood: surly answer that ‘it is a Session.’ In\r\n      that case, Monseigneur will crave leave to remark that Edicts\r\n      cannot be registered by _order_ in a Session; and indeed to\r\n      enter, against such registry, his individual humble Protest.\r\n      ‘_Vous êtes bien le maître_ (You will do your pleasure)’, answers\r\n      the King; and thereupon, in high state, marches out, escorted by\r\n      his Court-retinue; D’Orléans himself, as in duty bound, escorting\r\n      him, but only to the gate. Which duty done, D’Orléans returns in\r\n      from the gate; redacts his Protest, in the face of an applauding\r\n      Parlement, an applauding France; and so—has _cut_ his\r\n      Court-moorings, shall we say? And will now sail and drift, fast\r\n      enough, towards Chaos?\r\n\r\n      Thou foolish D’Orléans; Equality that art to be! Is Royalty grown\r\n      a mere wooden Scarecrow; whereon thou, pert scald-headed crow,\r\n      mayest alight at pleasure, and peck? Not yet wholly.\r\n\r\n      Next day, a Lettre-de-Cachet sends D’Orléans to bethink himself\r\n      in his Château of Villers-Cotterets, where, alas, is no Paris\r\n      with its joyous necessaries of life; no fascinating indispensable\r\n      Madame de Buffon,—light wife of a great Naturalist much too old\r\n      for her. Monseigneur, it is said, does nothing but walk\r\n      distractedly, at Villers-Cotterets; cursing his stars. Versailles\r\n      itself shall hear penitent wail from him, so hard is his doom. By\r\n      a second, simultaneous Lettre-de-Cachet, Goody Fréteau is hurled\r\n      into the Stronghold of Ham, amid the Norman marshes; by a third,\r\n      Sabatier de Cabre into Mont St. Michel, amid the Norman\r\n      quicksands. As for the Parlement, it must, on summons, travel out\r\n      to Versailles, with its Register-Book under its arm, to have the\r\n      Protest _biffé_ (expunged); not without admonition, and even\r\n      rebuke. A stroke of authority which, one might have hoped, would\r\n      quiet matters.\r\n\r\n      Unhappily, no; it is a mere taste of the whip to rearing\r\n      coursers, which makes them rear worse! When a team of Twenty-five\r\n      Millions begins rearing, what is Loménie’s whip? The Parlement\r\n      will nowise acquiesce meekly; and set to register the Protestant\r\n      Edict, and do its other work, in salutary fear of these three\r\n      Lettres-de-Cachet. Far from that, it begins questioning\r\n      Lettres-de-Cachet generally, their legality, endurability; emits\r\n      dolorous objurgation, petition on petition to have its three\r\n      Martyrs delivered; cannot, till that be complied with, so much as\r\n      think of examining the Protestant Edict, but puts it off always\r\n      “till this day week.”[76]\r\n\r\n      In which objurgatory strain Paris and France joins it, or rather\r\n      has preceded it; making fearful chorus. And now also the other\r\n      Parlements, at length opening their mouths, begin to join; some\r\n      of them, as at Grenoble and at Rennes, with portentous\r\n      emphasis,—threatening, by way of reprisal, to interdict the very\r\n      Tax-gatherer.[77] ‘In all former contests,’ as Malesherbes\r\n      remarks, ‘it was the Parlement that excited the Public; but here\r\n      it is the Public that excites the Parlement.’\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.VII.\r\n      Internecine.\r\n\r\n      What a France, through these winter months of the year 1787! The\r\n      very Œil-de-Bœuf is doleful, uncertain; with a general feeling\r\n      among the Suppressed, that it were better to be in Turkey. The\r\n      Wolf-hounds are suppressed, the Bear-hounds, Duke de Coigny, Duke\r\n      de Polignac: in the Trianon little-heaven, her Majesty, one\r\n      evening, takes Besenval’s arm; asks his candid opinion. The\r\n      intrepid Besenval,—having, as he hopes, nothing of the sycophant\r\n      in _him_,—plainly signifies that, with a Parlement in rebellion,\r\n      and an Œil-de-Bœuf in suppression, the King’s Crown is in\r\n      danger;—whereupon, singular to say, her Majesty, as if hurt,\r\n      changed the subject, _et ne me parla plus de rien!_[78]\r\n\r\n      To whom, indeed, can this poor Queen speak? In need of wise\r\n      counsel, if ever mortal was; yet beset here only by the hubbub of\r\n      chaos! Her dwelling-place is so bright to the eye, and confusion\r\n      and black care darkens it all. Sorrows of the Sovereign, sorrows\r\n      of the woman, think-coming sorrows environ her more and more.\r\n      Lamotte, the Necklace-Countess, has in these late months escaped,\r\n      perhaps been suffered to escape, from the Salpêtrière. Vain was\r\n      the hope that Paris might thereby forget her; and this\r\n      ever-widening-lie, and heap of lies, subside. The Lamotte, with a\r\n      V (for _Voleuse_, Thief) branded on both shoulders, has got to\r\n      England; and will therefrom emit lie on lie; defiling the highest\r\n      queenly name: mere distracted lies;[79] which, in its present\r\n      humour, France will greedily believe.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, it is too clear our Successive Loan is not filling.\r\n      As indeed, in such circumstances, a Loan registered by expunging\r\n      of Protests was not the likeliest to fill. Denunciation of\r\n      _Lettres-de-Cachet_, of Despotism generally, abates not: the\r\n      Twelve Parlements are busy; the Twelve hundred Placarders,\r\n      Balladsingers, Pamphleteers. Paris is what, in figurative speech,\r\n      they call “flooded with pamphlets (_regorge de brochures_);”\r\n      flooded and eddying again. Hot deluge,—from so many Patriot\r\n      ready-writers, all at the _fervid_ or boiling point; each\r\n      ready-writer, now in the hour of eruption, going like an Iceland\r\n      Geyser! Against which what can a judicious friend Morellet do; a\r\n      Rivarol, an unruly Linguet (well paid for it),—spouting _cold!_\r\n\r\n      Now also, at length, does come discussion of the Protestant\r\n      Edict: but only for new embroilment; in pamphlet and\r\n      counter-pamphlet, increasing the madness of men. Not even\r\n      Orthodoxy, bedrid as she seemed, but will have a hand in this\r\n      confusion. She, once again in the shape of Abbé Lenfant, “whom\r\n      Prelates drive to visit and congratulate,”—raises audible sound\r\n      from her pulpit-drum.[80] Or mark how D’Espréménil, who has his\r\n      own confused way in all things, produces at the right moment in\r\n      Parlementary harangue, a pocket Crucifix, with the apostrophe:\r\n      ‘Will ye crucify him afresh?’ _Him_, O D’Espréménil, without\r\n      scruple;—considering what poor stuff, of ivory and filigree, _he_\r\n      is made of!\r\n\r\n      To all which add only that poor Brienne has fallen sick; so hard\r\n      was the tear and wear of his sinful youth, so violent, incessant\r\n      is this agitation of his foolish old age. Baited, bayed at\r\n      through so many throats, his Grace, growing consumptive,\r\n      inflammatory (with _humeur de dartre_), lies reduced to milk\r\n      diet; in exasperation, almost in desperation; with “repose,”\r\n      precisely the impossible recipe, prescribed as the\r\n      indispensable.[81]\r\n\r\n      On the whole, what can a poor Government do, but once more recoil\r\n      ineffectual? The King’s Treasury is running towards the lees; and\r\n      Paris “eddies with a flood of pamphlets.” At all rates, let the\r\n      _latter_ subside a little! D’Orléans gets back to Raincy, which\r\n      is nearer Paris and the fair frail Buffon; finally to Paris\r\n      itself: neither are Fréteau and Sabatier banished forever. The\r\n      Protestant Edict is registered; to the joy of Boissy d’Anglas and\r\n      good Malesherbes: Successive Loan, all protests expunged or else\r\n      withdrawn, remains open,—the rather as few or none come to fill\r\n      it. States-General, for which the Parlement has clamoured, and\r\n      now the whole Nation clamours, will follow “in five years,”—if\r\n      indeed not sooner. O Parlement of Paris, what a clamour was that!\r\n      ‘Messieurs,’ said old d’Ormesson, ‘you will get States-General,\r\n      and you will repent it.’ Like the Horse in the Fable, who, to be\r\n      avenged of his enemy, applied to the Man. The Man mounted; did\r\n      swift execution on the enemy; but, unhappily, would not dismount!\r\n      Instead of five years, let three years pass, and this clamorous\r\n      Parlement shall have both seen its enemy hurled prostrate, and\r\n      been itself ridden to foundering (say rather, jugulated for hide\r\n      and shoes), and lie dead in the ditch.\r\n\r\n      Under such omens, however, we have reached the spring of 1788. By\r\n      no path can the King’s Government find passage for itself, but is\r\n      everywhere shamefully flung back. Beleaguered by Twelve\r\n      rebellious Parlements, which are grown to be the organs of an\r\n      angry Nation, it can advance nowhither; can accomplish nothing,\r\n      obtain nothing, not so much as money to subsist on; but must sit\r\n      there, seemingly, to be eaten up of Deficit.\r\n\r\n      The measure of the Iniquity, then, of the Falsehood which has\r\n      been gathering through long centuries, is nearly full? At least,\r\n      that of the misery is! For the hovels of the Twenty-five\r\n      Millions, the misery, permeating upwards and forwards, as its law\r\n      is, has got so far,—to the very Œil-de-Bœuf of Versailles. Man’s\r\n      hand, in this blind pain, is set against man: not only the low\r\n      against the higher, but the higher against each other; Provincial\r\n      Noblesse is bitter against Court Noblesse; Robe against Sword;\r\n      Rochet against Pen. But against the King’s Government who is not\r\n      bitter? Not even Besenval, in these days. To it all men and\r\n      bodies of men are become as enemies; it is the centre whereon\r\n      infinite contentions unite and clash. What new universal\r\n      vertiginous movement is this; of Institution, social\r\n      Arrangements, individual Minds, which once worked cooperative;\r\n      now rolling and grinding in distracted collision? Inevitable: it\r\n      is the breaking-up of a World-Solecism, worn out at last, down\r\n      even to bankruptcy of money! And so this poor Versailles Court,\r\n      as the chief or central Solecism, finds all the other Solecisms\r\n      arrayed against it. Most natural! For your human Solecism, be it\r\n      Person or Combination of Persons, is ever, by law of Nature,\r\n      uneasy; if verging towards bankruptcy, it is even miserable:—and\r\n      when would the meanest Solecism consent to blame or amend\r\n      _itself_, while there remained another to amend?\r\n\r\n      These threatening signs do not terrify Loménie, much less teach\r\n      him. Loménie, though of light nature, is not without courage, of\r\n      a sort. Nay, have we not read of lightest creatures, trained\r\n      Canary-birds, that could fly cheerfully with lighted matches, and\r\n      fire cannon; fire whole powder-magazines? To sit and die of\r\n      deficit is no part of Loménie’s plan. The evil is considerable;\r\n      but can he not remove it, can he not attack it? At lowest, he can\r\n      attack the _symptom_ of it: these rebellious Parlements he can\r\n      attack, and perhaps remove. Much is dim to Loménie, but two\r\n      things are clear: that such Parlementary duel with Royalty is\r\n      growing perilous, nay internecine; above all, that money must be\r\n      had. Take thought, brave Loménie; thou Garde-des-Sceaux\r\n      Lamoignon, who hast ideas! So often defeated, balked cruelly when\r\n      the golden fruit seemed within clutch, rally for one other\r\n      struggle. To tame the Parlement, to fill the King’s coffers:\r\n      these are now life-and-death questions.\r\n\r\n      Parlements have been tamed, more than once. Set to perch “on the\r\n      peaks of rocks in accessible except by litters,” a Parlement\r\n      grows reasonable. O Maupeou, thou bold man, had we left thy work\r\n      where it was!—But apart from exile, or other violent methods, is\r\n      there not one method, whereby all things are tamed, even lions?\r\n      The method of hunger! What if the Parlement’s supplies were cut\r\n      off; namely its Lawsuits!\r\n\r\n      Minor Courts, for the trying of innumerable minor causes, might\r\n      be instituted: these we could call _Grand Bailliages_. Whereon\r\n      the Parlement, shortened of its prey, would look with yellow\r\n      despair; but the Public, fond of cheap justice, with favour and\r\n      hope. Then for Finance, for registering of Edicts, why not, from\r\n      our own Œil-de-Bœuf Dignitaries, our Princes, Dukes, Marshals,\r\n      make a thing we could call _Plenary Court_; and there, so to\r\n      speak, do our registering ourselves? St. Louis had his Plenary\r\n      Court, of Great Barons;[82] most useful to him: our Great Barons\r\n      are still here (at least the Name of them is still here); our\r\n      necessity is greater than his.\r\n\r\n      Such is the Loménie-Lamoignon device; welcome to the King’s\r\n      Council, as a light-beam in great darkness. The device seems\r\n      feasible, it is eminently needful: be it once well executed,\r\n      great deliverance is wrought. Silent, then, and steady; now or\r\n      never!—the World shall see one other Historical Scene; and so\r\n      singular a man as Loménie de Brienne still the Stage-manager\r\n      there.\r\n\r\n      Behold, accordingly, a Home-Secretary Bréteuil “beautifying\r\n      Paris,” in the peaceablest manner, in this hopeful spring weather\r\n      of 1788; the old hovels and hutches disappearing from our\r\n      Bridges: as if for the State too there were halcyon weather, and\r\n      nothing to do but beautify. Parlement seems to sit acknowledged\r\n      victor. Brienne says nothing of Finance; or even says, and\r\n      prints, that it is all well. How is this; such halcyon quiet;\r\n      though the Successive Loan did not fill? In a victorious\r\n      Parlement, Counsellor Goeslard de Monsabert even denounces that\r\n      “levying of the Second Twentieth on strict valuation;” and gets\r\n      decree that the valuation shall not be strict,—not on the\r\n      privileged classes. Nevertheless Brienne endures it, launches no\r\n      Lettre-de-Cachet against it. How is this?\r\n\r\n      Smiling is such vernal weather; but treacherous, sudden! For one\r\n      thing, we hear it whispered, “the Intendants of Provinces have\r\n      all got order to be at their posts on a certain day.” Still more\r\n      singular, what incessant Printing is this that goes on at the\r\n      King’s Château, under lock and key? Sentries occupy all gates and\r\n      windows; the Printers come not out; they sleep in their\r\n      workrooms; their very food is handed in to them![83] A victorious\r\n      Parlement smells new danger. D’Espréménil has ordered horses to\r\n      Versailles; prowls round that guarded Printing-Office; prying,\r\n      snuffing, if so be the sagacity and ingenuity of man may\r\n      penetrate it.\r\n\r\n      To a shower of gold most things are penetrable. D’Espréménil\r\n      descends on the lap of a Printer’s Danae, in the shape of “five\r\n      hundred louis d’or:” the Danae’s Husband smuggles a ball of clay\r\n      to her; which she delivers to the golden Counsellor of Parlement.\r\n      Kneaded within it, their stick printed proof-sheets;—by Heaven!\r\n      the royal Edict of that same self-registering _Plenary Court;_ of\r\n      those _Grand Bailliages_ that shall cut short our Lawsuits! It is\r\n      to be promulgated over all France on one and the same day.\r\n\r\n      This, then, is what the Intendants were bid wait for at their\r\n      posts: this is what the Court sat hatching, as its accursed\r\n      cockatrice-egg; and would not stir, though provoked, till the\r\n      brood were out! Hie with it, D’Espréménil, home to Paris; convoke\r\n      instantaneous Sessions; let the Parlement, and the Earth, and the\r\n      Heavens know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.VIII.\r\n      Loménie’s Death-throes.\r\n\r\n      On the morrow, which is the 3rd of May, 1788, an astonished\r\n      Parlement sits convoked; listens speechless to the speech of\r\n      D’Espréménil, unfolding the infinite misdeed. Deed of treachery;\r\n      of unhallowed darkness, such as Despotism loves! Denounce it, O\r\n      Parlement of Paris; awaken France and the Universe; roll what\r\n      thunder-barrels of forensic eloquence thou hast: with thee too it\r\n      is verily Now or never!\r\n\r\n      The Parlement is not wanting, at such juncture. In the hour of\r\n      his extreme jeopardy, the lion first incites himself by roaring,\r\n      by lashing his sides. So here the Parlement of Paris. On the\r\n      motion of D’Espréménil, a most patriotic Oath, of the One-and-all\r\n      sort, is sworn, with united throat;—an excellent new-idea, which,\r\n      in these coming years, shall not remain unimitated. Next comes\r\n      indomitable Declaration, almost of the rights of man, at least of\r\n      the rights of Parlement; Invocation to the friends of French\r\n      Freedom, in this and in subsequent time. All which, or the\r\n      essence of all which, is brought to paper; in a tone wherein\r\n      something of plaintiveness blends with, and tempers, heroic\r\n      valour. And thus, having sounded the storm-bell,—which Paris\r\n      hears, which all France will hear; and hurled such defiance in\r\n      the teeth of Loménie and Despotism, the Parlement retires as from\r\n      a tolerable first day’s work.\r\n\r\n      But how Loménie felt to see his cockatrice-egg (so essential to\r\n      the salvation of France) broken in this premature manner, let\r\n      readers fancy! Indignant he clutches at his thunderbolts (_de\r\n      Cachet_, of the Seal); and launches two of them: a bolt for\r\n      D’Espréménil; a bolt for that busy Goeslard, whose service in the\r\n      Second Twentieth and “strict valuation” is not forgotten. Such\r\n      bolts clutched promptly overnight, and launched with the early\r\n      new morning, shall strike agitated Paris if not into\r\n      requiescence, yet into wholesome astonishment.\r\n\r\n      Ministerial thunderbolts may be launched; but if they do not\r\n      _hit?_ D’Espréménil and Goeslard, warned, both of them, as is\r\n      thought, by the singing of some friendly bird, elude the Loménie\r\n      Tipstaves; escape disguised through skywindows, over roofs, to\r\n      their own Palais de Justice: the thunderbolts have _missed_.\r\n      Paris (for the buzz flies abroad) is struck into astonishment\r\n      _not_ wholesome. The two martyrs of Liberty doff their disguises;\r\n      don their long gowns; behold, in the space of an hour, by aid of\r\n      ushers and swift runners, the Parlement, with its Counsellors,\r\n      Presidents, even Peers, sits anew assembled. The assembled\r\n      Parlement declares that these its two martyrs cannot be given up,\r\n      to any sublunary authority; moreover that the “session is\r\n      permanent,” admitting of no adjournment, till pursuit of them has\r\n      been relinquished.\r\n\r\n      And so, with forensic eloquence, denunciation and protest, with\r\n      couriers going and returning, the Parlement, in this state of\r\n      continual explosion that shall cease neither night nor day, waits\r\n      the issue. Awakened Paris once more inundates those outer courts;\r\n      boils, in floods wilder than ever, through all avenues. Dissonant\r\n      hubbub there is; jargon as of Babel, in the hour when they were\r\n      first smitten (as here) with mutual unintelligibilty, and the\r\n      people had not yet dispersed!\r\n\r\n      Paris City goes through its diurnal epochs, of working and\r\n      slumbering; and now, for the second time, most European and\r\n      African mortals are asleep. But here, in this Whirlpool of Words,\r\n      sleep falls not; the Night spreads her coverlid of Darkness over\r\n      it in vain. Within is the sound of mere martyr invincibility;\r\n      tempered with the due tone of plaintiveness. Without is the\r\n      infinite expectant hum,—growing drowsier a little. So has it\r\n      lasted for six-and-thirty hours.\r\n\r\n      But hark, through the dead of midnight, what tramp is this? Tramp\r\n      as of armed men, foot and horse; Gardes Françaises, Gardes\r\n      Suisses: marching hither; in silent regularity; in the flare of\r\n      torchlight! There are Sappers, too, with axes and crowbars:\r\n      apparently, if the doors open not, they will be forced!—It is\r\n      Captain D’Agoust, missioned from Versailles. D’Agoust, a man of\r\n      known firmness;—who once forced Prince Condé himself, by mere\r\n      incessant looking at him, to give satisfaction and fight;[84] he\r\n      now, with axes and torches is advancing on the very sanctuary of\r\n      Justice. Sacrilegious; yet what help? The man is a soldier; looks\r\n      merely at his orders; impassive, moves forward like an inanimate\r\n      engine.\r\n\r\n      The doors open on summons, there need no axes; door after door.\r\n      And now the innermost door opens; discloses the long-gowned\r\n      Senators of France: a hundred and sixty-seven by tale, seventeen\r\n      of them Peers; sitting there, majestic, “in permanent session.”\r\n      Were not the men military, and of cast-iron, this sight, this\r\n      silence reechoing the clank of his own boots, might stagger him!\r\n      For the hundred and sixty-seven receive him in perfect silence;\r\n      which some liken to that of the Roman Senate overfallen by\r\n      Brennus; some to that of a nest of coiners surprised by officers\r\n      of the Police.[85] _Messieurs_, said D’Agoust, _De par le Roi!_\r\n      Express order has charged D’Agoust with the sad duty of arresting\r\n      two individuals: M. Duval d’Espréménil and M. Goeslard de\r\n      Monsabert. Which respectable individuals, as he has not the\r\n      honour of knowing them, are hereby invited, in the King’s name,\r\n      to surrender themselves.—Profound silence! Buzz, which grows a\r\n      murmur: ‘We are all D’Espréménils!’ ventures a voice; which other\r\n      voices repeat. The President inquires, Whether he will employ\r\n      violence? Captain D’Agoust, honoured with his Majesty’s\r\n      commission, has to execute his Majesty’s order; would so gladly\r\n      do it without violence, will in any case do it; grants an august\r\n      Senate space to deliberate which method _they_ prefer. And\r\n      thereupon D’Agoust, with grave military courtesy, has withdrawn\r\n      for the moment.\r\n\r\n      What boots it, august Senators? All avenues are closed with fixed\r\n      bayonets. Your Courier gallops to Versailles, through the dewy\r\n      Night; but also gallops back again, with tidings that the order\r\n      is authentic, that it is irrevocable. The outer courts simmer\r\n      with idle population; but D’Agoust’s grenadier-ranks stand there\r\n      as immovable floodgates: there will be no revolting to deliver\r\n      you. ‘Messieurs!’ thus spoke D’Espréménil, ‘when the victorious\r\n      Gauls entered Rome, which they had carried by assault, the Roman\r\n      Senators, clothed in their purple, sat there, in their curule\r\n      chairs, with a proud and tranquil countenance, awaiting slavery\r\n      or death. Such too is the lofty spectacle, which you, in this\r\n      hour, offer to the universe (_à l’univers_), after having\r\n      generously’—with much more of the like, as can still be read.[86]\r\n\r\n      In vain, O D’Espréménil! Here is this cast-iron Captain D’Agoust,\r\n      with his cast-iron military air, come back. Despotism,\r\n      constraint, destruction sit waving in his plumes. D’Espréménil\r\n      must fall silent; heroically give himself up, lest worst befall.\r\n      Him Goeslard heroically imitates. With spoken and speechless\r\n      emotion, they fling themselves into the arms of their\r\n      Parlementary brethren, for a last embrace: and so amid plaudits\r\n      and plaints, from a hundred and sixty-five throats; amid wavings,\r\n      sobbings, a whole forest-sigh of Parlementary pathos,—they are\r\n      led through winding passages, to the rear-gate; where, in the\r\n      gray of the morning, two Coaches with _Exempts_ stand waiting.\r\n      There must the victims mount; bayonets menacing behind.\r\n      D’Espréménil’s stern question to the populace, “Whether they have\r\n      courage?” is answered by silence. They mount, and roll; and\r\n      neither the rising of the May sun (it is the 6th morning), nor\r\n      its setting shall lighten their heart: but they fare forward\r\n      continually; D’Espréménil towards the utmost Isles of Sainte\r\n      Marguerite, or Hieres (supposed by some, if that is any comfort,\r\n      to be Calypso’s Island); Goeslard towards the land-fortress of\r\n      Pierre-en-Cize, extant then, near the City of Lyons.\r\n\r\n      Captain D’Agoust may now therefore look forward to Majorship, to\r\n      Commandantship of the Tuilleries;[87]—and withal vanish from\r\n      History; where nevertheless he has been fated to do a notable\r\n      thing. For not only are D’Espréménil and Goeslard safe whirling\r\n      southward, but the Parlement itself has straightway to march out:\r\n      to that also his inexorable order reaches. Gathering up their\r\n      long skirts, they file out, the whole Hundred and Sixty-five of\r\n      them, through two rows of unsympathetic grenadiers: a spectacle\r\n      to gods and men. The people revolt not; they only wonder and\r\n      grumble: also, we remark, these unsympathetic grenadiers are\r\n      _Gardes Françaises_,—who, one day, will sympathise! In a word,\r\n      the Palais de Justice is swept clear, the doors of it are locked;\r\n      and D’Agoust returns to Versailles with the key in his\r\n      pocket,—having, as was said, merited preferment.\r\n\r\n      As for this Parlement of Paris, now turned out to the street, we\r\n      will without reluctance leave it there. The Beds of Justice it\r\n      had to undergo, in the coming fortnight, at Versailles, in\r\n      registering, or rather refusing to register, those new-hatched\r\n      Edicts; and how it assembled in taverns and tap-rooms there, for\r\n      the purpose of Protesting,[88] or hovered disconsolate, with\r\n      outspread skirts, not knowing where to assemble; and was reduced\r\n      to lodge Protest “with a Notary;” and in the end, to sit still\r\n      (in a state of forced “vacation”), and do nothing; all this,\r\n      natural now, as the burying of the dead after battle, shall not\r\n      concern us. The Parlement of Paris has as good as performed its\r\n      part; doing and misdoing, so far, but hardly further, could it\r\n      stir the world.\r\n\r\n      Loménie has removed the evil then? Not at all: not so much as the\r\n      symptom of the evil; scarcely the _twelfth_ part of the symptom,\r\n      and exasperated the other eleven! The Intendants of Provinces,\r\n      the Military Commandants are at their posts, on the appointed 8th\r\n      of May: but in no Parlement, if not in the single one of Douai,\r\n      can these new Edicts get registered. Not peaceable signing with\r\n      ink; but browbeating, bloodshedding, appeal to primary club-law!\r\n      Against these Bailliages, against this Plenary Court, exasperated\r\n      Themis everywhere shows face of battle; the Provincial Noblesse\r\n      are of her party, and whoever hates Loménie and the evil time;\r\n      with her attorneys and Tipstaves, she enlists and operates down\r\n      even to the populace. At Rennes in Brittany, where the historical\r\n      Bertrand de Moleville is Intendant, it has passed from fatal\r\n      continual duelling, between the military and gentry, to\r\n      street-fighting; to stone-volleys and musket-shot: and still the\r\n      Edicts remained unregistered. The afflicted Bretons send\r\n      remonstrance to Loménie, by a Deputation of Twelve; whom,\r\n      however, Loménie, having heard them, shuts up in the Bastille. A\r\n      second larger deputation he meets, by his scouts, on the road,\r\n      and persuades or frightens back. But now a third largest\r\n      Deputation is indignantly sent by _many_ roads: refused audience\r\n      on arriving, it meets to take council; invites Lafayette and all\r\n      Patriot Bretons in Paris to assist; agitates itself; becomes the\r\n      _Breton Club_, first germ of—the _Jacobins’ Society._[89]\r\n\r\n      So many as eight Parlements get exiled:[90] others might need\r\n      that remedy, but it is one not always easy of appliance. At\r\n      Grenoble, for instance, where a Mounier, a Barnave have not been\r\n      idle, the Parlement had due order (by _Lettres-de-Cachet_) to\r\n      depart, and exile itself: but on the morrow, instead of coaches\r\n      getting yoked, the alarm-bell bursts forth, ominous; and peals\r\n      and booms all day: crowds of mountaineers rush down, with axes,\r\n      even with firelocks,—whom (most ominous of all!) the soldiery\r\n      shows no eagerness to deal with. “Axe over head,” the poor\r\n      General has to sign capitulation; to engage that the\r\n      _Lettres-de-Cachet_ shall remain unexecuted, and a beloved\r\n      Parlement stay where it is. Besancon, Dijon, Rouen, Bourdeaux,\r\n      are not what they should be! At Pau in Bearn, where the old\r\n      Commandant had failed, the new one (a Grammont, native to them)\r\n      is met by a Procession of townsmen with the Cradle of Henri\r\n      Quatre, the Palladium of their Town; is conjured as he venerates\r\n      this old Tortoise-shell, in which the great Henri was rocked, not\r\n      to trample on Bearnese liberty; is informed, withal, that his\r\n      Majesty’s cannon are all safe—in the keeping of his Majesty’s\r\n      faithful Burghers of Pau, and do now lie pointed on the walls\r\n      there; ready for action![91]\r\n\r\n      At this rate, your Grand Bailliages are like to have a stormy\r\n      infancy. As for the Plenary Court, it has literally expired in\r\n      the birth. The very Courtiers looked shy at it; old Marshal\r\n      Broglie declined the honour of sitting therein. Assaulted by a\r\n      universal storm of mingled ridicule and execration,[92] this poor\r\n      Plenary Court met once, and never any second time. Distracted\r\n      country! Contention hisses up, with forked hydra-tongues,\r\n      wheresoever poor Loménie sets his foot. “Let a Commandant, a\r\n      Commissioner of the King,” says Weber, “enter one of these\r\n      Parlements to have an Edict registered, the whole Tribunal will\r\n      disappear, and leave the Commandant alone with the Clerk and\r\n      First President. The Edict registered and the Commandant gone,\r\n      the whole Tribunal hastens back, to declare such registration\r\n      null. The highways are covered with _Grand Deputations_ of\r\n      Parlements, proceeding to Versailles, to have their registers\r\n      expunged by the King’s hand; or returning home, to cover a new\r\n      page with a new resolution still more audacious.”[93]\r\n\r\n      Such is the France of this year 1788. Not now a Golden or Paper\r\n      Age of Hope; with its horse-racings, balloon-flyings, and finer\r\n      sensibilities of the heart: ah, gone is that; its golden\r\n      effulgence paled, bedarkened in _this_ singular manner,—brewing\r\n      towards preternatural weather! For, as in that wreck-storm of\r\n      _Paul et Virginie_ and Saint-Pierre,—“One huge motionless cloud”\r\n      (say, of Sorrow and Indignation) “girdles our whole horizon;\r\n      streams up, hairy, copper-edged, over a sky of the colour of\r\n      lead.” Motionless itself; but “small clouds” (as exiled\r\n      Parlements and suchlike), “parting from it, fly over the zenith,\r\n      with the velocity of birds:”—till at last, with one loud howl,\r\n      the whole Four Winds be dashed together, and all the world\r\n      exclaim, There is the tornado! _Tout le monde s’écria, Voilà\r\n      l’ouragan!_\r\n\r\n      For the rest, in such circumstances, the Successive Loan, very\r\n      naturally, remains unfilled; neither, indeed, can that impost of\r\n      the Second Twentieth, at least not on “strict valuation,” be\r\n      levied to good purpose: “Lenders,” says Weber, in his hysterical\r\n      vehement manner, “are afraid of ruin; tax-gatherers of hanging.”\r\n      The very Clergy turn away their face: convoked in Extraordinary\r\n      Assembly, they afford no gratuitous gift (_don gratuit_),—if it\r\n      be not that of advice; here too instead of cash is clamour for\r\n      States-General.[94]\r\n\r\n      O Loménie-Brienne, with thy poor flimsy mind all bewildered, and\r\n      now “three actual cauteries” on thy worn-out body; who art like\r\n      to die of inflamation, provocation, milk-diet, _dartres vives_\r\n      and _maladie_—(best untranslated);[95] and presidest over a\r\n      France with innumerable _actual cauteries_, which also is dying\r\n      of inflammation and the rest! Was it wise to quit the bosky\r\n      verdures of Brienne, and thy new ashlar Château there, and what\r\n      it held, for _this?_ Soft were those shades and lawns; sweet the\r\n      hymns of Poetasters, the blandishments of high-rouged Graces:[96]\r\n      and always this and the other Philosophe Morellet (nothing\r\n      deeming himself or thee a questionable Sham-Priest) could be so\r\n      happy in making happy:—and also (hadst thou known it), in the\r\n      Military School hard by there sat, studying mathematics, a\r\n      dusky-complexioned taciturn Boy, under the name of: NAPOLEON\r\n      BONAPARTE!—With fifty years of effort, and one final dead-lift\r\n      struggle, thou hast made an exchange! Thou hast got thy robe of\r\n      office,—as Hercules had his Nessus’-shirt.\r\n\r\n      On the 13th of July of this 1788, there fell, on the very edge of\r\n      harvest, the most frightful hailstorm; scattering into wild waste\r\n      the Fruits of the Year; which had otherwise suffered grievously\r\n      by drought. For sixty leagues round Paris especially, the ruin\r\n      was almost total.[97] To so many other evils, then, there is to\r\n      be added, that of dearth, perhaps of famine.\r\n\r\n      Some days before this hailstorm, on the 5th of July; and still\r\n      more decisively some days after it, on the 8th of August,—Loménie\r\n      announces that the States-General are actually to meet in the\r\n      following month of May. Till after which period, this of the\r\n      Plenary Court, and the rest, shall remain _postponed_. Further,\r\n      as in Loménie there is no plan of forming or holding these most\r\n      desirable States-General, “thinkers are invited” to furnish him\r\n      with one,—through the medium of discussion by the public press!\r\n\r\n      What could a poor Minister do? There are still ten months of\r\n      respite reserved: a sinking pilot will fling out all things, his\r\n      very biscuit-bags, lead, log, compass and quadrant, before\r\n      flinging out _himself_. It is on this principle, of sinking, and\r\n      the incipient delirium of despair, that we explain likewise the\r\n      almost miraculous “invitation to thinkers.” Invitation to Chaos\r\n      to be so kind as build, out of its tumultuous drift-wood, an Ark\r\n      of Escape for him! In these cases, not invitation but command has\r\n      usually proved serviceable.—The Queen stood, that evening,\r\n      pensive, in a window, with her face turned towards the Garden.\r\n      The _Chef de Gobelet_ had followed her with an obsequious cup of\r\n      coffee; and then retired till it were sipped. Her Majesty\r\n      beckoned Dame Campan to approach: ‘_Grand Dieu!_’ murmured she,\r\n      with the cup in her hand, ‘what a piece of news will be made\r\n      public today! The King grants States-General.’ Then raising her\r\n      eyes to Heaven (if Campan were not mistaken), she added: ‘’Tis a\r\n      first beat of the drum, of ill-omen for France. This Noblesse\r\n      will ruin us.’[98]\r\n\r\n      During all that hatching of the Plenary Court, while Lamoignon\r\n      looked so mysterious, Besenval had kept asking him one question:\r\n      Whether they had cash? To which as Lamoignon always answered (on\r\n      the faith of Loménie) that the cash was safe, judicious Besenval\r\n      rejoined that then all was safe. Nevertheless, the melancholy\r\n      fact is, that the royal coffers are almost getting literally void\r\n      of coin. Indeed, apart from all other things this “invitation to\r\n      thinkers,” and the great change now at hand are enough to “arrest\r\n      the circulation of capital,” and forward only that of pamphlets.\r\n      A few thousand gold louis are now all of money or money’s worth\r\n      that remains in the King’s Treasury. With another movement as of\r\n      desperation, Loménie invites Necker to come and be Controller of\r\n      Finances! Necker has other work in view than controlling Finances\r\n      for Loménie: with a dry refusal he stands taciturn; awaiting his\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n      What shall a desperate Prime Minister do? He has grasped at the\r\n      strongbox of the King’s Theatre: some Lottery had been set on\r\n      foot for those sufferers by the hailstorm; in his extreme\r\n      necessity, Loménie lays hands even on this.[99] To make provision\r\n      for the passing day, on any terms, will soon be impossible.—On\r\n      the 16th of August, poor Weber heard, at Paris and Versailles,\r\n      hawkers, “with a hoarse stifled tone of voice (_voix étouffée,\r\n      sourde_)” drawling and snuffling, through the streets, an _Edict\r\n      concerning Payments_ (such was the soft title Rivarol had\r\n      contrived for it): all payments at the Royal Treasury shall be\r\n      made henceforth, three-fifths in Cash, and the remaining\r\n      two-fifths—in Paper bearing interest! Poor Weber almost swooned\r\n      at the sound of these cracked voices, with their bodeful\r\n      raven-note; and will never forget the effect it had on him.[100]\r\n\r\n      But the effect on Paris, on the world generally? From the dens of\r\n      Stock-brokerage, from the heights of Political Economy, of\r\n      Neckerism and Philosophism; from all articulate and inarticulate\r\n      throats, rise hootings and howlings, such as ear had not yet\r\n      heard. Sedition itself may be imminent! Monseigneur d’Artois,\r\n      moved by Duchess Polignac, feels called to wait upon her Majesty;\r\n      and explain frankly what crisis matters stand in. “The Queen\r\n      wept;” Brienne himself wept;—for it is now visible and palpable\r\n      that he must go.\r\n\r\n      Remains only that the Court, to whom his manners and garrulities\r\n      were always agreeable, shall make his fall soft. The grasping old\r\n      man has already got his Archbishopship of Toulouse exchanged for\r\n      the richer one of Sens: and now, in this hour of pity, he shall\r\n      have the Coadjutorship for his nephew (hardly yet of due age); a\r\n      Dameship of the Palace for his niece; a Regiment for her husband;\r\n      for himself a red Cardinal’s-hat, a _Coupe de Bois_ (cutting from\r\n      the royal forests), and on the whole “from five to six hundred\r\n      thousand livres of revenue:”[101] finally, his Brother, the Comte\r\n      de Brienne, shall still continue War-minister. Buckled-round with\r\n      such bolsters and huge featherbeds of Promotion, let him now fall\r\n      as soft as he can!\r\n\r\n      And so Loménie departs: rich if Court-titles and Money-bonds can\r\n      enrich him; but if these cannot, perhaps the poorest of all\r\n      extant men. “Hissed at by the people of Versailles,” he drives\r\n      forth to Jardi; southward to Brienne,—for recovery of health.\r\n      Then to Nice, to Italy; but shall return; shall glide to and fro,\r\n      tremulous, faint-twinkling, fallen on awful times: till the\r\n      Guillotine—snuff out his weak existence? Alas, worse: for it is\r\n      _blown_ out, or choked out, foully, pitiably, on the way to the\r\n      Guillotine! In his Palace of Sens, rude Jacobin Bailiffs made him\r\n      drink with them from his own wine-cellars, feast with them from\r\n      his own larder; and on the morrow morning, the miserable old man\r\n      lies dead. This is the end of Prime Minister, Cardinal Archbishop\r\n      Loménie de Brienne. Flimsier mortal was seldom fated to do as\r\n      weighty a mischief; to have a life as despicable-envied, an exit\r\n      as frightful. _Fired_, as the phrase is, with ambition: blown,\r\n      like a kindled rag, the sport of winds, not this way, not that\r\n      way, but of all ways, straight towards _such_ a\r\n      powder-mine,—which he kindled! Let us pity the hapless Loménie;\r\n      and forgive him; and, as soon as possible, forget him.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.3.IX.\r\n      Burial with Bonfire.\r\n\r\n      Besenval, during these extraordinary operations, of Payment\r\n      two-fifths in Paper, and change of Prime Minister, had been out\r\n      on a tour through his District of Command; and indeed, for the\r\n      last months, peacefully drinking the waters of Contrexeville.\r\n      Returning now, in the end of August, towards Moulins, and\r\n      “knowing nothing,” he arrives one evening at Langres; finds the\r\n      whole Town in a state of uproar (_grande rumeur_). Doubtless some\r\n      sedition; a thing too common in these days! He alights\r\n      nevertheless; inquires of a “man tolerably dressed,” what the\r\n      matter is?—‘How?’ answers the man, ‘you have not heard the news?\r\n      The Archbishop is thrown out, and M. Necker is recalled; and all\r\n      is going to go well!’[102]\r\n\r\n      Such _rumeur_ and vociferous acclaim has risen round M. Necker,\r\n      ever from “that day when he issued from the Queen’s Apartments,”\r\n      a nominated Minister. It was on the 24th of August: “the\r\n      galleries of the Château, the courts, the streets of Versailles;\r\n      in few hours, the Capital; and, as the news flew, all France,\r\n      resounded with the cry of _Vive le Roi! Vive M. Necker!_[103] In\r\n      Paris indeed it unfortunately got the length of turbulence.”\r\n      Petards, rockets go off, in the Place Dauphine, more than enough.\r\n      A “wicker Figure (_Mannequin d’osier_),” in Archbishop’s stole,\r\n      made emblematically, three-fifths of it satin, two-fifths of it\r\n      paper, is promenaded, not in silence, to the popular\r\n      judgment-bar; is doomed; shriven by a mock Abbé de Vermond; then\r\n      solemnly consumed by fire, at the foot of Henri’s Statue on the\r\n      Pont Neuf;—with such petarding and huzzaing that Chevalier Dubois\r\n      and his City-watch see good finally to make a charge (more or\r\n      less ineffectual); and there wanted not burning of sentry-boxes,\r\n      forcing of guard-houses, and also “dead bodies thrown into the\r\n      Seine over-night,” to avoid new effervescence.[104]\r\n\r\n      Parlements therefore shall return from exile: Plenary Court,\r\n      Payment two-fifths in Paper have vanished; gone off in smoke, at\r\n      the foot of Henri’s Statue. States-General (with a Political\r\n      Millennium) are now certain; nay, it shall be announced, in our\r\n      fond haste, for January next: and all, as the Langres man said,\r\n      is “going to go.”\r\n\r\n      To the prophetic glance of Besenval, one other thing is too\r\n      apparent: that Friend Lamoignon cannot keep his Keepership.\r\n      Neither he nor War-minister Comte de Brienne! Already old Foulon,\r\n      with an eye to be war-minister himself, is making underground\r\n      movements. This is that same Foulon named _âme damnée du\r\n      Parlement;_ a man grown gray in treachery, in griping,\r\n      projecting, intriguing and iniquity: who once when it was\r\n      objected, to some finance-scheme of his, ‘What will the people\r\n      do?’—made answer, in the fire of discussion, ‘The people may eat\r\n      grass:’ hasty words, which fly abroad irrevocable,—and will send\r\n      back tidings!\r\n\r\n      Foulon, to the relief of the world, fails on this occasion; and\r\n      will always fail. Nevertheless it steads not M. de Lamoignon. It\r\n      steads not the doomed man that he have interviews with the King;\r\n      and be “seen to return _radieux_,” emitting _rays_. Lamoignon is\r\n      the hated of Parlements: Comte de Brienne is Brother to the\r\n      Cardinal Archbishop. The 24th of August has been; and the 14th\r\n      September is not yet, when they two, as their great Principal had\r\n      done, descend,—made to fall _soft_, like him.\r\n\r\n      And now, as if the last burden had been rolled from its heart,\r\n      and assurance were at length perfect, Paris bursts forth anew\r\n      into extreme jubilee. The Basoche rejoices aloud, that the foe of\r\n      Parlements is fallen; Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty have rejoiced;\r\n      and rejoice. Nay now, with new emphasis, Rascality itself,\r\n      starting suddenly from its dim depths, will arise and do it,—for\r\n      down even thither the new Political Evangel, in some rude version\r\n      or other, has penetrated. It is Monday, the 14th of September\r\n      1788: Rascality assembles anew, in great force, in the Place\r\n      Dauphine; lets off petards, fires blunderbusses, to an incredible\r\n      extent, without interval, for eighteen hours. There is again a\r\n      wicker Figure, “_Mannequin_ of osier:” the centre of endless\r\n      howlings. Also Necker’s Portrait snatched, or purchased, from\r\n      some Printshop, is borne processionally, aloft on a perch, with\r\n      huzzas;—an example to be remembered.\r\n\r\n      But chiefly on the Pont Neuf, where the Great Henri, in bronze,\r\n      rides sublime; there do the crowds gather. All passengers must\r\n      stop, till they have bowed to the People’s King, and said\r\n      audibly: _Vive Henri Quatre; au diable Lamoignon!_ No carriage\r\n      but must stop; not even that of his Highness d’Orléans. Your\r\n      coach-doors are opened: Monsieur will please to put forth his\r\n      head and bow; or even, if refractory, to alight altogether, and\r\n      kneel: from Madame a wave of her plumes, a smile of her fair\r\n      face, there where she sits, shall suffice;—and surely a coin or\r\n      two (to buy _fusées_) were not unreasonable from the Upper\r\n      Classes, friends of Liberty? In this manner it proceeds for days;\r\n      in such rude horse-play,—not without kicks. The City-watch can do\r\n      nothing; hardly save its own skin: for the last twelve-month, as\r\n      we have sometimes seen, it has been a kind of pastime to _hunt_\r\n      the Watch. Besenval indeed is at hand with soldiers; but they\r\n      have orders to avoid firing, and are not prompt to stir.\r\n\r\n      On Monday morning the explosion of petards began: and now it is\r\n      near midnight of Wednesday; and the “wicker _Mannequin_” is to be\r\n      buried,—apparently in the Antique fashion. Long rows of torches,\r\n      following it, move towards the Hôtel Lamoignon; but “a servant of\r\n      mine” (Besenval’s) has run to give warning, and there are\r\n      soldiers come. Gloomy Lamoignon is not to die by conflagration,\r\n      or this night; not yet for a year, and then by gunshot (suicidal\r\n      or accidental is unknown).[105] Foiled Rascality burns its\r\n      “Mannikin of osier,” under his windows; “tears up the\r\n      sentry-box,” and rolls off: to try Brienne; to try Dubois Captain\r\n      of the Watch. Now, however, all is bestirring itself; Gardes\r\n      Françaises, Invalides, Horse-patrol: the Torch Procession is met\r\n      with sharp shot, with the thrusting of bayonets, the slashing of\r\n      sabres. Even Dubois makes a charge, with that Cavalry of his, and\r\n      the cruelest charge of all: “there are a great many killed and\r\n      wounded.” Not without clangour, complaint; subsequent criminal\r\n      trials, and official persons dying of heartbreak![106] So,\r\n      however, with steel-besom, Rascality is brushed back into its dim\r\n      depths, and the streets are swept clear.\r\n\r\n      Not for a century and half had Rascality ventured to step forth\r\n      in this fashion; not for so long, showed its huge rude lineaments\r\n      in the light of day. A Wonder and new Thing: as yet gamboling\r\n      merely, in awkward Brobdingnag sport, not without quaintness;\r\n      hardly in anger: yet in its huge half-vacant laugh lurks a shade\r\n      of grimness,—which could unfold itself!\r\n\r\n      However, the thinkers invited by Loménie are now far on with\r\n      their pamphlets: States-General, on one plan or another, will\r\n      infallibly meet; if not in January, as was once hoped, yet at\r\n      latest in May. Old Duke de Richelieu, moribund in these autumn\r\n      days, opens his eyes once more, murmuring, ‘What would Louis\r\n      Fourteenth’ (whom he remembers) ‘have said!’—then closes them\r\n      again, forever, before the evil time.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 1.IV.\r\n      STATES-GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.4.I.\r\n      The Notables Again.\r\n\r\n      The universal prayer, therefore, is to be fulfilled! Always in\r\n      days of national perplexity, when wrong abounded and help was\r\n      not, this remedy of States-General was called for; by a\r\n      Malesherbes, nay by a Fénelon;[107] even Parlements calling for\r\n      it were “escorted with blessings.” And now behold it is\r\n      vouchsafed us; States-General shall verily be!\r\n\r\n      To say, let States-General be, was easy; to say in what manner\r\n      they shall be, is not so easy. Since the year of 1614, there have\r\n      no States-General met in France, all trace of them has vanished\r\n      from the living habits of men. Their structure, powers, methods\r\n      of procedure, which were never in any measure fixed, have now\r\n      become wholly a vague possibility. Clay which the potter may\r\n      shape, this way or that:—say rather, the twenty-five millions of\r\n      potters; for so many have now, more or less, a vote in it! How to\r\n      shape the States-General? There is a problem. Each\r\n      Body-corporate, each privileged, each organised Class has secret\r\n      hopes of its own in that matter; and also secret misgivings of\r\n      its own,—for, behold, this monstrous twenty-million Class,\r\n      hitherto the dumb sheep which these others had to agree about the\r\n      manner of shearing, is now also arising with hopes! It has ceased\r\n      or is ceasing to be dumb; it speaks through Pamphlets, or at\r\n      least brays and growls behind them, in unison,—increasing\r\n      wonderfully their volume of sound.\r\n\r\n      As for the Parlement of Paris, it has at once declared for the\r\n      “old form of 1614.” Which form had this advantage, that the\r\n      _Tiers Etat_, Third Estate, or Commons, figured there as a show\r\n      mainly: whereby the Noblesse and Clergy had but to avoid quarrel\r\n      between themselves, and decide unobstructed what _they_ thought\r\n      best. Such was the clearly declared opinion of the Paris\r\n      Parlement. But, being met by a storm of mere hooting and howling\r\n      from all men, such opinion was blown straightway to the winds;\r\n      and the popularity of the Parlement along with it,—never to\r\n      return. The Parlements part, we said above, was as good as\r\n      played. Concerning which, however, there is this further to be\r\n      noted: the proximity of dates. It was on the 22nd of September\r\n      that the Parlement returned from “vacation” or “exile in its\r\n      estates;” to be reinstalled amid boundless jubilee from all\r\n      Paris. Precisely next day it was, that this same Parlement came\r\n      to its “clearly declared opinion:” and then on the morrow after\r\n      that, you behold it “covered with outrages”; its outer court, one\r\n      vast sibilation, and the glory departed from it for\r\n      evermore.[108] A popularity of twenty-four hours was, in those\r\n      times, no uncommon allowance.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, how superfluous was that invitation of\r\n      Loménie’s: the invitation to thinkers! Thinkers and unthinkers,\r\n      by the million, are spontaneously at their post, doing what is in\r\n      them. Clubs labour: _Societe Publicole;_ Breton Club; Enraged\r\n      Club, _Club des Enrages_. Likewise Dinner-parties in the Palais\r\n      Royal; your Mirabeaus, Talleyrands dining there, in company with\r\n      Chamforts, Morellets, with Duponts and hot Parlementeers, not\r\n      without object! For a certain _Necker_ean Lion’s-provider, whom\r\n      one could name, assembles them there;[109]—or even their own\r\n      private determination to have dinner does it. And then as to\r\n      Pamphlets—in figurative language; “it is a sheer snowing of\r\n      pamphlets; like to snow up the Government thoroughfares!” Now is\r\n      the time for Friends of Freedom; sane, and even insane.\r\n\r\n      Count, or self-styled Count, d’Aintrigues, “the young\r\n      Languedocian gentleman,” with perhaps Chamfort the Cynic to help\r\n      him, rises into furor almost Pythic; highest, where many are\r\n      high.[110] Foolish young Languedocian gentleman; who himself so\r\n      soon, “emigrating among the foremost,” must fly indignant over\r\n      the marches, with the _Contrat Social_ in his pocket,—towards\r\n      outer darkness, thankless intriguings, _ignis-fatuus_ hoverings,\r\n      and death by the stiletto! Abbé Sieyes has left Chartres\r\n      Cathedral, and canonry and book-shelves there; has let his\r\n      tonsure grow, and come to Paris with a secular head, of the most\r\n      irrefragable sort, to ask three questions, and answer them: _What\r\n      is the Third Estate? All.—What has it hitherto been in our form\r\n      of government? Nothing.—What does it want? To become Something._\r\n\r\n      D’Orléans,—for be sure he, on his way to Chaos, is in the thick\r\n      of this,—promulgates his _Deliberations;_[111] fathered by him,\r\n      written by Laclos of the _Liaisons Dangereuses._ The result of\r\n      which comes out simply: “The Third Estate is the Nation.” On the\r\n      other hand, Monseigneur d’Artois, with other Princes of the\r\n      Blood, publishes, in solemn _Memorial_ to the King, that if such\r\n      things be listened to, Privilege, Nobility, Monarchy, Church,\r\n      State and Strongbox are in danger.[112] In danger truly: and yet\r\n      if you do not listen, are they out of danger? It is the voice of\r\n      all France, this sound that rises. Immeasurable, manifold; as the\r\n      sound of outbreaking waters: wise were he who knew what to do in\r\n      it,—if not to fly to the mountains, and hide himself?\r\n\r\n      How an ideal, all-seeing Versailles Government, sitting there on\r\n      such principles, in such an environment, would have determined to\r\n      demean itself at this new juncture, may even yet be a question.\r\n      Such a Government would have felt too well that its long task was\r\n      now drawing to a close; that, under the guise of these\r\n      States-General, at length inevitable, a new omnipotent Unknown of\r\n      Democracy was coming into being; in presence of which no\r\n      Versailles Government either could or should, except in a\r\n      provisory character, continue extant. To enact which provisory\r\n      character, so unspeakably important, might its whole faculties\r\n      but have sufficed; and so a peaceable, gradual, well-conducted\r\n      Abdication and _Domine-dimittas_ have been the issue!\r\n\r\n      This for our ideal, all-seeing Versailles Government. But for the\r\n      actual irrational Versailles Government? Alas, that is a\r\n      Government existing there only for its own behoof: without right,\r\n      except possession; and now also without might. It foresees\r\n      nothing, sees nothing; has not so much as a purpose, but has only\r\n      purposes,—and the instinct whereby all that exists will struggle\r\n      to keep existing. Wholly a vortex; in which vain counsels,\r\n      hallucinations, falsehoods, intrigues, and imbecilities whirl;\r\n      like withered rubbish in the meeting of winds! The Œil-de-Bœuf\r\n      has its irrational hopes, if also its fears. Since hitherto all\r\n      States-General have done as good as nothing, why should these do\r\n      more? The Commons, indeed, look dangerous; but on the whole is\r\n      not revolt, unknown now for five generations, an impossibility?\r\n      The Three Estates can, by management, be set against each other;\r\n      the Third will, as heretofore, join with the King; will, out of\r\n      mere spite and self-interest, be eager to tax and vex the other\r\n      two. The other two are thus delivered bound into our hands, that\r\n      we may fleece them likewise. Whereupon, money being got, and the\r\n      Three Estates all in quarrel, dismiss them, and let the future go\r\n      as it can! As good Archbishop Loménie was wont to say: ‘There are\r\n      so many accidents; and it needs but one to save us.’—How many to\r\n      destroy us?\r\n\r\n      Poor Necker in the midst of such an anarchy does what is possible\r\n      for him. He looks into it with obstinately hopeful face; lauds\r\n      the known rectitude of the kingly mind; listens indulgent-like to\r\n      the known perverseness of the queenly and courtly;—emits if any\r\n      proclamation or regulation, one favouring the _Tiers Etat;_ but\r\n      settling nothing; hovering afar off rather, and advising all\r\n      things to settle themselves. The grand questions, for the\r\n      present, have got reduced to two: the Double Representation, and\r\n      the Vote by Head. Shall the Commons have a “double\r\n      representation,” that is to say, have as many members as the\r\n      Noblesse and Clergy united? Shall the States-General, when once\r\n      assembled, vote and deliberate, in one body, or in three separate\r\n      bodies; “vote by head, or vote by class,”—_ordre_ as they call\r\n      it? These are the moot-points now filling all France with jargon,\r\n      logic and eleutheromania. To terminate which, Necker bethinks\r\n      him, Might not a second Convocation of the Notables be fittest?\r\n      Such second Convocation is resolved on.\r\n\r\n      On the 6th of November of this year 1788, these Notables\r\n      accordingly have reassembled; after an interval of some eighteen\r\n      months. They are Calonne’s old Notables, the same Hundred and\r\n      Forty-four,—to show one’s impartiality; likewise to save time.\r\n      They sit there once again, in their Seven Bureaus, in the hard\r\n      winter weather: it is the hardest winter seen since 1709;\r\n      thermometer below zero of Fahrenheit, Seine River frozen\r\n      over.[113] Cold, scarcity and eleutheromaniac clamour: a changed\r\n      world since these Notables were “organed out,” in May gone a\r\n      year! They shall see now whether, under their Seven Princes of\r\n      the Blood, in their Seven Bureaus, they can settle the\r\n      moot-points.\r\n\r\n      To the surprise of Patriotism, these Notables, once so patriotic,\r\n      seem to incline the wrong way; towards the anti-patriotic side.\r\n      They stagger at the Double Representation, at the Vote by Head:\r\n      there is not affirmative decision; there is mere debating, and\r\n      that not with the best aspects. For, indeed, were not these\r\n      Notables themselves mostly of the Privileged Classes? They\r\n      clamoured once; now they have their misgivings; make their\r\n      dolorous representations. Let them vanish, ineffectual; and\r\n      return no more! They vanish after a month’s session, on this 12th\r\n      of December, year 1788: the _last_ terrestrial Notables, not to\r\n      reappear any other time, in the History of the World.\r\n\r\n      And so, the clamour still continuing, and the Pamphlets; and\r\n      nothing but patriotic Addresses, louder and louder, pouting in on\r\n      us from all corners of France,—Necker himself some fortnight\r\n      after, before the year is yet done, has to present his\r\n      _Report_,[114] recommending at his own risk that same Double\r\n      Representation; nay almost enjoining it, so loud is the jargon\r\n      and eleutheromania. What dubitating, what circumambulating! These\r\n      whole six noisy months (for it began with Brienne in July,) has\r\n      not _Report_ followed _Report_, and one Proclamation flown in the\r\n      teeth of the other?[115]\r\n\r\n      However, that first moot-point, as we see, is now settled. As for\r\n      the second, that of voting by Head or by Order, it unfortunately\r\n      is still left hanging. It hangs there, we may say, between the\r\n      Privileged Orders and the Unprivileged; as a ready-made\r\n      battle-prize, and necessity of war, from the very first: which\r\n      battle-prize whosoever seizes it—may thenceforth bear as\r\n      battle-flag, with the best omens!\r\n\r\n      But so, at least, by Royal Edict of the 24th of January,[116]\r\n      does it finally, to impatient expectant France, become not only\r\n      indubitable that National Deputies _are_ to meet, but possible\r\n      (so far and hardly farther has the royal Regulation gone) to\r\n      begin electing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.4.II.\r\n      The Election.\r\n\r\n      Up, then, and be doing! The royal signal-word flies through\r\n      France, as through vast forests the rushing of a mighty wind. At\r\n      Parish Churches, in Townhalls, and every House of Convocation; by\r\n      Bailliages, by Seneschalsies, in whatsoever form men convene;\r\n      there, with confusion enough, are Primary Assemblies forming. To\r\n      elect your Electors; such is the form prescribed: then to draw up\r\n      your “Writ of Plaints and Grievances (_Cahier de plaintes et\r\n      doléances_),” of which latter there is no lack.\r\n\r\n      With such virtue works this Royal January Edict; as it rolls\r\n      rapidly, in its leathern mails, along these frostbound highways,\r\n      towards all the four winds. Like some _fiat_, or magic\r\n      spell-word;—which such things do resemble! For always, as it\r\n      sounds out “at the market-cross,” accompanied with trumpet-blast;\r\n      presided by Bailli, Seneschal, or other minor Functionary, with\r\n      beef-eaters; or, in country churches is droned forth after\r\n      sermon, “_au prône des messes paroissales;_” and is registered,\r\n      posted and let fly over all the world,—you behold how this\r\n      multitudinous French People, so long simmering and buzzing in\r\n      eager expectancy, begins heaping and shaping itself into organic\r\n      groups. Which organic groups, again, hold smaller organic\r\n      grouplets: the inarticulate buzzing becomes articulate speaking\r\n      and acting. By Primary Assembly, and then by Secondary; by\r\n      “successive elections,” and infinite elaboration and scrutiny,\r\n      according to prescribed process—shall the genuine “Plaints and\r\n      Grievances” be at length got to paper; shall the fit National\r\n      Representative be at length laid hold of.\r\n\r\n      How the whole People shakes itself, as if it had one life; and,\r\n      in thousand-voiced rumour, announces that it is awake, suddenly\r\n      out of long death-sleep, and will thenceforth sleep no more! The\r\n      long looked-for has come at last; wondrous news, of Victory,\r\n      Deliverance, Enfranchisement, sounds magical through every heart.\r\n      To the proud strong man it has come; whose strong hands shall no\r\n      more be gyved; to whom boundless unconquered continents lie\r\n      disclosed. The weary day-drudge has heard of it; the beggar with\r\n      his crusts moistened in tears. What! To us also has hope reached;\r\n      down even to us? Hunger and hardship are not to be eternal? The\r\n      bread we extorted from the rugged glebe, and, with the toil of\r\n      our sinews, reaped and ground, and kneaded into loaves, was not\r\n      wholly for another, then; but we also shall eat of it, and be\r\n      filled? Glorious news (answer the prudent elders), but all-too\r\n      unlikely!—Thus, at any rate, may the lower people, who pay no\r\n      money-taxes and have no right to vote,[117] assiduously crowd\r\n      round those that do; and most Halls of Assembly, within doors and\r\n      without, seem animated enough.\r\n\r\n      Paris, alone of Towns, is to have Representatives; the number of\r\n      them twenty. Paris is divided into Sixty Districts; each of which\r\n      (assembled in some church, or the like) is choosing two Electors.\r\n      Official deputations pass from District to District, for all is\r\n      inexperience as yet, and there is endless consulting. The streets\r\n      swarm strangely with busy crowds, pacific yet restless and\r\n      loquacious; at intervals, is seen the gleam of military muskets;\r\n      especially about the Palais, where Parlement, once more on duty,\r\n      sits querulous, almost tremulous.\r\n\r\n      Busy is the French world! In those great days, what poorest\r\n      speculative craftsman but will leave his workshop; if not to\r\n      vote, yet to assist in voting? On all highways is a rustling and\r\n      bustling. Over the wide surface of France, ever and anon, through\r\n      the spring months, as the Sower casts his corn abroad upon the\r\n      furrows, sounds of congregating and dispersing; of crowds in\r\n      deliberation, acclamation, voting by ballot and by voice,—rise\r\n      discrepant towards the ear of Heaven. To which political\r\n      phenomena add this economical one, that Trade is stagnant, and\r\n      also Bread getting dear; for before the rigorous winter there\r\n      was, as we said, a rigorous summer, with drought, and on the 13th\r\n      of July with destructive hail. What a fearful day! all cried\r\n      while that tempest fell. Alas, the next anniversary of it will be\r\n      a worse.[118] Under such aspects is France electing National\r\n      Representatives.\r\n\r\n      The incidents and specialties of these Elections belong not to\r\n      Universal, but to Local or Parish History: for which reason let\r\n      not the new troubles of Grenoble or Besancon; the bloodshed on\r\n      the streets of Rennes, and consequent march thither of the Breton\r\n      “Young Men” with Manifesto by their “Mothers, Sisters and\r\n      Sweethearts;”[119] nor suchlike, detain us here. It is the same\r\n      sad history everywhere; with superficial variations. A reinstated\r\n      Parlement (as at Besancon), which stands astonished at this\r\n      Behemoth of a States-General it had itself evoked, starts\r\n      forward, with more or less audacity, to fix a thorn in its nose;\r\n      and, alas, is instantaneously struck down, and hurled quite\r\n      out,—for the new popular force can use not only arguments but\r\n      brickbats! Or else, and perhaps combined with this, it is an\r\n      order of Noblesse (as in Brittany), which will beforehand tie up\r\n      the Third Estate, that it harm not the old privileges. In which\r\n      act of tying up, never so skilfully set about, there is likewise\r\n      no possibility of prospering; but the Behemoth-Briareus snaps\r\n      your cords like green rushes. Tie up? Alas, Messieurs! And then,\r\n      as for your chivalry rapiers, valour and wager-of-battle, think\r\n      one moment, how can that answer? The plebeian heart too has red\r\n      life in it, which changes not to paleness at glance even of you;\r\n      and “the six hundred Breton gentlemen assembled in arms, for\r\n      seventy-two hours, in the Cordeliers’ Cloister, at Rennes,”—have\r\n      to come out again, _wiser_ than they entered. For the Nantes\r\n      Youth, the Angers Youth, all Brittany was astir; “mothers,\r\n      sisters and sweethearts” shrieking after them, _March!_ The\r\n      Breton Noblesse must even let the mad world have its way.[120]\r\n\r\n      In other Provinces, the Noblesse, with equal goodwill, finds it\r\n      better to stick to Protests, to well-redacted “_Cahiers_ of\r\n      grievances,” and satirical writings and speeches. Such is\r\n      partially their course in Provence; whither indeed Gabriel Honoré\r\n      Riquetti Comte de Mirabeau has rushed down from Paris, to speak a\r\n      word in season. In Provence, the Privileged, backed by their Aix\r\n      Parlement, discover that such novelties, enjoined though they be\r\n      by Royal Edict, tend to National detriment; and what is still\r\n      more indisputable, “to impair the dignity of the Noblesse.”\r\n      Whereupon Mirabeau protesting aloud, this same Noblesse, amid\r\n      huge tumult within doors and without, flatly determines to expel\r\n      him from their Assembly. No other method, not even that of\r\n      successive duels, would answer with him, the obstreperous\r\n      fierce-glaring man. Expelled he accordingly is.\r\n\r\n      “In all countries, in all times,” exclaims he departing, “the\r\n      Aristocrats have implacably pursued every friend of the People;\r\n      and with tenfold implacability, if such a one were himself born\r\n      of the Aristocracy. It was thus that the last of the Gracchi\r\n      perished, by the hands of the Patricians. But he, being struck\r\n      with the mortal stab, flung dust towards heaven, and called on\r\n      the Avenging Deities; and from this dust there was born\r\n      Marius,—Marius not so illustrious for exterminating the Cimbri,\r\n      as for overturning in Rome the tyranny of the Nobles.”[121]\r\n      Casting up _which_ new curious handful of dust (through the\r\n      Printing-press), to breed what it can and may, Mirabeau stalks\r\n      forth into the Third Estate.\r\n\r\n      That he now, to ingratiate himself with this Third Estate,\r\n      “opened a cloth-shop in Marseilles,” and for moments became a\r\n      furnishing tailor, or even the fable that he did so, is to us\r\n      always among the pleasant memorabilities of this era. Stranger\r\n      Clothier never wielded the ell-wand, and rent webs for men, or\r\n      fractional parts of men. The _Fils Adoptif_ is indignant at such\r\n      disparaging fable,[122]—which nevertheless was widely believed in\r\n      those days.[123] But indeed, if Achilles, in the heroic ages,\r\n      killed mutton, why should not Mirabeau, in the unheroic ones,\r\n      measure broadcloth?\r\n\r\n      More authentic are his triumph-progresses through that disturbed\r\n      district, with mob jubilee, flaming torches, “windows hired for\r\n      two louis,” and voluntary guard of a hundred men. He is Deputy\r\n      Elect, both of Aix and of Marseilles; but will prefer Aix. He has\r\n      opened his far-sounding voice, the depths of his far-sounding\r\n      soul; he can quell (such virtue is in a spoken word) the\r\n      pride-tumults of the rich, the hunger-tumults of the poor; and\r\n      wild multitudes move under him, as under the moon do billows of\r\n      the sea: he has become a world compeller, and ruler over men.\r\n\r\n      One other incident and specialty we note; with how different an\r\n      interest! It is of the Parlement of Paris; which starts forward,\r\n      like the others (only with less audacity, seeing better how it\r\n      lay), to nose-ring that Behemoth of a States-General. Worthy\r\n      Doctor Guillotin, respectable practitioner in Paris, has drawn up\r\n      his little “Plan of a _Cahier of doléances_;”—as had he not,\r\n      having the wish and gift, the clearest liberty to do? He is\r\n      getting the people to sign it; whereupon the surly Parlement\r\n      summons him to give an account of himself. He goes; but with all\r\n      Paris at his heels; which floods the outer courts, and copiously\r\n      signs the _Cahier_ even there, while the Doctor is giving account\r\n      of himself within! The Parlement cannot too soon dismiss\r\n      Guillotin, with compliments; to be borne home shoulder-high.[124]\r\n      This respectable Guillotin we hope to behold once more, and\r\n      perhaps only once; the Parlement not even once, but let it be\r\n      engulphed unseen by us.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile such things, cheering as they are, tend little to cheer\r\n      the national creditor, or indeed the creditor of any kind. In the\r\n      midst of universal portentous doubt, what certainty can seem so\r\n      certain as money in the purse, and the wisdom of keeping it\r\n      there? Trading Speculation, Commerce of all kinds, has as far as\r\n      possible come to a dead pause; and the hand of the industrious\r\n      lies idle in his bosom. Frightful enough, when now the rigour of\r\n      seasons has also done its part, and to scarcity of work is added\r\n      scarcity of food! In the opening spring, there come rumours of\r\n      forestalment, there come King’s Edicts, Petitions of bakers\r\n      against millers; and at length, in the month of April—troops of\r\n      ragged Lackalls, and fierce cries of starvation! These are the\r\n      thrice-famed _Brigands:_ an actual existing quotity of persons:\r\n      who, long reflected and reverberated through so many millions of\r\n      heads, as in concave multiplying mirrors, become a whole Brigand\r\n      World; and, like a kind of Supernatural Machinery wondrously move\r\n      the Epos of the Revolution. The Brigands are here: the Brigands\r\n      are there; the Brigands are coming! Not otherwise sounded the\r\n      clang of Phoebus Apollo’s silver bow, scattering pestilence and\r\n      pale terror; for this clang too was of the imagination;\r\n      preternatural; and it too walked in formless immeasurability,\r\n      _having made itself like to the Night_ (νυκτὶ ἐοικώς.)!\r\n\r\n      But remark at least, for the first time, the singular empire of\r\n      Suspicion, in those lands, in those days. If poor famishing men\r\n      shall, prior to death, gather in groups and crowds, as the poor\r\n      fieldfares and plovers do in bitter weather, were it but that\r\n      they may chirp mournfully together, and misery look in the eyes\r\n      of misery; if famishing men (what famishing fieldfares cannot do)\r\n      should discover, once congregated, that they need not die while\r\n      food is in the land, since they are many, and with empty wallets\r\n      have right hands: in all this, what need were there of\r\n      Preternatural Machinery? To most people none; but not to French\r\n      people, in a time of Revolution. These Brigands (as Turgot’s also\r\n      were, fourteen years ago) have all been set on; enlisted, though\r\n      without tuck of drum,—by Aristocrats, by Democrats, by D’Orléans,\r\n      D’Artois, and enemies of the public weal. Nay Historians, to this\r\n      day, will prove it by one argument: these Brigands pretending to\r\n      have no victual, nevertheless contrive to drink, nay, have been\r\n      seen drunk.[125] An unexampled fact! But on the whole, may we not\r\n      predict that a people, with such a width of Credulity and of\r\n      Incredulity (the proper union of which makes Suspicion, and\r\n      indeed unreason generally), will see Shapes enough of Immortals\r\n      fighting in its battle-ranks, and never want for Epical\r\n      Machinery?\r\n\r\n      Be this as it may, the Brigands are clearly got to Paris, in\r\n      considerable multitudes:[126] with sallow faces, lank hair (the\r\n      true enthusiast complexion), with sooty rags; and also with large\r\n      clubs, which they smite angrily against the pavement! These\r\n      mingle in the Election tumult; would fain sign Guillotin’s\r\n      _Cahier_, or any _Cahier_ or Petition whatsoever, could they but\r\n      write. Their enthusiast complexion, the smiting of their sticks\r\n      bodes little good to any one; least of all to rich\r\n      master-manufacturers of the Suburb Saint-Antoine, with whose\r\n      workmen they consort.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.4.III.\r\n      Grown Electric.\r\n\r\n      But now also National Deputies from all ends of France are in\r\n      Paris, with their commissions, what they call pouvoirs, or\r\n      powers, in their pockets; inquiring, consulting; looking out for\r\n      lodgings at Versailles. The States-General shall open there, if\r\n      not on the First, then surely on the Fourth of May, in grand\r\n      procession and gala. The _Salle des Menus_ is all\r\n      new-carpentered, bedizened for them; their very costume has been\r\n      fixed; a grand controversy which there was, as to “slouch-hats or\r\n      slouched-hats,” for the Commons Deputies, has got as good as\r\n      adjusted. Ever new strangers arrive; loungers, miscellaneous\r\n      persons, officers on furlough,—as the worthy Captain Dampmartin,\r\n      whom we hope to be acquainted with: these also, from all regions,\r\n      have repaired hither, to see what is toward. Our Paris\r\n      Committees, of the Sixty Districts, are busier than ever; it is\r\n      now too clear, the Paris Elections will be late.\r\n\r\n      On Monday, the 27th of April, Astronomer Bailly notices that the\r\n      Sieur Réveillon is not at his post. The Sieur Réveillon,\r\n      “extensive Paper Manufacturer of the Rue St. Antoine;” he,\r\n      commonly so punctual, is absent from the Electoral Committee;—and\r\n      even will never reappear there. In those “immense Magazines of\r\n      velvet paper” has aught befallen? Alas, yes! Alas, it is no\r\n      Montgolfier rising there today; but Drudgery, Rascality and the\r\n      Suburb that is rising! Was the Sieur Réveillon, himself once a\r\n      journeyman, heard to say that “a journeyman might live handsomely\r\n      on fifteen _sous_ a-day?” Some sevenpence halfpenny: ’tis a\r\n      slender sum! Or was he only thought, and believed, to be heard\r\n      saying it? By this long chafing and friction it would appear the\r\n      National temper has got _electric_.\r\n\r\n      Down in those dark dens, in those dark heads and hungry hearts,\r\n      who knows in what strange figure the new Political Evangel may\r\n      have shaped itself; what miraculous “Communion of Drudges” may be\r\n      getting formed! Enough: grim individuals, soon waxing to grim\r\n      multitudes, and other multitudes crowding to see, beset that\r\n      Paper-Warehouse; demonstrate, in loud ungrammatical language\r\n      (addressed to the passions too), the insufficiency of sevenpence\r\n      halfpenny a-day. The City-watch cannot dissipate them; broils\r\n      arise and bellowings; Réveillon, at his wits’ end, entreats the\r\n      Populace, entreats the authorities. Besenval, now in active\r\n      command, Commandant of Paris, does, towards evening, to\r\n      Réveillon’s earnest prayer, send some thirty Gardes Françaises.\r\n      These clear the street, happily without firing; and take post\r\n      there for the night in hope that it may be all over.[127]\r\n\r\n      Not so: on the morrow it is far worse. Saint-Antoine has arisen\r\n      anew, grimmer than ever;—reinforced by the unknown Tatterdemalion\r\n      Figures, with their enthusiast complexion and large sticks. The\r\n      City, through all streets, is flowing thitherward to see: “two\r\n      cartloads of paving-stones, that happened to pass that way” have\r\n      been seized as a visible godsend. Another detachment of Gardes\r\n      Françaises must be sent; Besenval and the Colonel taking earnest\r\n      counsel. Then still another; they hardly, with bayonets and\r\n      menace of bullets, penetrate to the spot. What a sight! A street\r\n      choked up, with lumber, tumult and the endless press of men. A\r\n      Paper-Warehouse eviscerated by axe and fire: mad din of Revolt;\r\n      musket-volleys responded to by yells, by miscellaneous missiles;\r\n      by tiles raining from roof and window,—tiles, execrations and\r\n      slain men!\r\n\r\n      The Gardes Françaises like it not, but have to persevere. All day\r\n      it continues, slackening and rallying; the sun is sinking, and\r\n      Saint-Antoine has not yielded. The City flies hither and thither:\r\n      alas, the sound of that musket-volleying booms into the far\r\n      dining-rooms of the Chaussée d’Antin; alters the tone of the\r\n      dinner-gossip there. Captain Dampmartin leaves his wine; goes out\r\n      with a friend or two, to see the fighting. Unwashed men growl on\r\n      him, with murmurs of ‘_À bas les Aristocrates_ (Down with the\r\n      Aristocrats);’ and insult the cross of St. Louis? They elbow him,\r\n      and hustle him; but do not pick his pocket;—as indeed at\r\n      Réveillon’s too there was not the slightest stealing.[128]\r\n\r\n      At fall of night, as the thing will not end, Besenval takes his\r\n      resolution: orders out the _Gardes Suisses_ with two pieces of\r\n      artillery. The Swiss Guards shall proceed thither; summon that\r\n      rabble to depart, in the King’s name. If disobeyed, they shall\r\n      load their artillery with grape-shot, visibly to the general eye;\r\n      shall again summon; if again disobeyed, fire,—and keep firing\r\n      “till the last man” be in this manner blasted off, and the street\r\n      clear. With which spirited resolution, as might have been hoped,\r\n      the business is got ended. At sight of the lit matches, of the\r\n      foreign red-coated Switzers, Saint-Antoine dissipates; hastily,\r\n      in the shades of dusk. There is an encumbered street; there are\r\n      “from four to five hundred” dead men. Unfortunate Réveillon has\r\n      found shelter in the Bastille; does therefrom, safe behind stone\r\n      bulwarks, issue, plaint, protestation, explanation, for the next\r\n      month. Bold Besenval has thanks from all the respectable Parisian\r\n      classes; but finds no special notice taken of him at\r\n      Versailles,—a thing the man of true worth is used to.[129]\r\n\r\n      But how it originated, this fierce electric sputter and\r\n      explosion? From D’Orléans! cries the Court-party: he, with his\r\n      gold, enlisted these Brigands,—surely in some surprising manner,\r\n      without sound of drum: he raked them in hither, from all corners;\r\n      to ferment and take fire; evil is his good. From the Court! cries\r\n      enlightened Patriotism: it is the cursed gold and wiles of\r\n      Aristocrats that enlisted them; set them upon ruining an innocent\r\n      Sieur Réveillon; to frighten the faint, and disgust men with the\r\n      career of Freedom.\r\n\r\n      Besenval, with reluctance, concludes that it came from “the\r\n      English, our natural enemies.” Or, alas, might not one rather\r\n      attribute it to Diana in the shape of Hunger? To some twin\r\n      _Dioscuri_, OPPRESSION and REVENGE; so often seen in the battles\r\n      of men? Poor Lackalls, all betoiled, besoiled, encrusted into dim\r\n      defacement; into whom nevertheless the breath of the Almighty has\r\n      breathed a living soul! To them it is clear only that\r\n      eleutheromaniac Philosophism has yet baked no bread; that\r\n      Patrioti Committee-men will level down to their own level, and no\r\n      lower. Brigands, or whatever they might be, it was bitter earnest\r\n      with them. They bury their dead with the title of _Défenseurs de\r\n      la Patrie_, Martyrs of the good Cause.\r\n\r\n      Or shall we say: Insurrection has now served its Apprenticeship;\r\n      and this was its proof-stroke, and no inconclusive one? Its next\r\n      will be a master-stroke; announcing indisputable Mastership to a\r\n      whole astonished world. Let that rock-fortress, Tyranny’s\r\n      stronghold, which they name _Bastille_, or _Building_, as if\r\n      there were no other building,—look to its guns!\r\n\r\n      But, in such wise, with primary and secondary Assemblies, and\r\n      _Cahiers_ of Grievances; with motions, congregations of all\r\n      kinds; with much thunder of froth-eloquence, and at last with\r\n      thunder of platoon-musquetry,—does agitated France accomplish its\r\n      Elections. With confused winnowing and sifting, in this rather\r\n      tumultuous manner, it has now (all except some remnants of Paris)\r\n      sifted out the true wheat-grains of National Deputies, Twelve\r\n      Hundred and Fourteen in number; and will forthwith open its\r\n      States-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.4.IV.\r\n      The Procession.\r\n\r\n      On the first Saturday of May, it is gala at Versailles; and\r\n      Monday, fourth of the month, is to be a still greater day. The\r\n      Deputies have mostly got thither, and sought out lodgings; and\r\n      are now successively, in long well-ushered files, kissing the\r\n      hand of Majesty in the Château. Supreme Usher de Brézé does not\r\n      give the highest satisfaction: we cannot but observe that in\r\n      ushering Noblesse or Clergy into the anointed Presence, he\r\n      liberally opens _both_ his folding-doors; and on the other hand,\r\n      for members of the Third Estate opens only one! However, there is\r\n      room to enter; Majesty has smiles for all.\r\n\r\n      The good Louis welcomes his Honourable Members, with smiles of\r\n      hope. He has prepared for them the Hall of _Menus_, the largest\r\n      near him; and often surveyed the workmen as they went on. A\r\n      spacious Hall: with raised platform for Throne, Court and\r\n      Blood-royal; space for six hundred Commons Deputies in front; for\r\n      half as many Clergy on this hand, and half as many Noblesse on\r\n      that. It has lofty galleries; wherefrom dames of honour,\r\n      splendent in _gaze d’or;_ foreign Diplomacies, and other\r\n      gilt-edged white-frilled individuals to the number of two\r\n      thousand,—may sit and look. Broad passages flow through it; and,\r\n      outside the inner wall, all round it. There are committee-rooms,\r\n      guard-rooms, robing-rooms: really a noble Hall; where upholstery,\r\n      aided by the subject fine-arts, has done its best; and crimson\r\n      tasseled cloths, and emblematic _fleurs-de-lys_ are not wanting.\r\n\r\n      The Hall is ready: the very costume, as we said, has been\r\n      settled; and the Commons are not to wear that hated slouch-hat\r\n      (_chapeau clabaud_), but one not quite so slouched (_chapeau\r\n      rabattu_). As for their manner of _working_, when all dressed:\r\n      for their “voting by head or by order” and the rest,—this, which\r\n      it were perhaps still time to settle, and in few hours will be no\r\n      longer time, remains unsettled; hangs dubious in the breast of\r\n      Twelve Hundred men.\r\n\r\n      But now finally the Sun, on Monday the 4th of May, has\r\n      risen;—unconcerned, as if it were no special day. And yet, as his\r\n      first rays could strike music from the Memnon’s Statue on the\r\n      Nile, what tones were these, so thrilling, tremulous of\r\n      preparation and foreboding, which he awoke in every bosom at\r\n      Versailles! Huge Paris, in all conceivable and inconceivable\r\n      vehicles, is pouring itself forth; from each Town and Village\r\n      come subsidiary rills; Versailles is a very sea of men. But above\r\n      all, from the Church of St. Louis to the Church of Notre-Dame:\r\n      one vast suspended-billow of Life,—with _spray_ scattered even to\r\n      the chimney-pots! For on chimney-tops too, as over the roofs, and\r\n      up thitherwards on every lamp-iron, sign-post, breakneck coign of\r\n      vantage, sits patriotic Courage; and every window bursts with\r\n      patriotic Beauty: for the Deputies are gathering at St. Louis\r\n      Church; to march in procession to Notre-Dame, and hear sermon.\r\n\r\n      Yes, friends, ye may sit and look: boldly or in thought, all\r\n      France, and all Europe, may sit and look; for it is a day like\r\n      few others. Oh, one might weep like Xerxes:—So many serried rows\r\n      sit perched there; like winged creatures, alighted out of Heaven:\r\n      all these, and so many more that follow them, shall have wholly\r\n      fled aloft again, vanishing into the blue Deep; and the memory of\r\n      this day still be fresh. It is the baptism-day of Democracy; sick\r\n      Time has given it birth, the numbered months being run. The\r\n      extreme-unction day of Feudalism! A superannuated System of\r\n      Society, decrepit with toils (for has it not done much; produced\r\n      you, and what ye have and know!)—and with thefts and brawls,\r\n      named glorious-victories; and with profligacies, sensualities,\r\n      and on the whole with dotage and senility,—is now to die: and so,\r\n      with death-throes and birth-throes, a new one is to be born. What\r\n      a work, O Earth and Heavens, what a work! Battles and bloodshed,\r\n      September Massacres, Bridges of Lodi, retreats of Moscow,\r\n      Waterloos, Peterloos, Tenpound Franchises, Tarbarrels and\r\n      Guillotines;—and from this present date, if one might prophesy,\r\n      some two centuries of it still to fight! Two centuries; hardly\r\n      less; before Democracy go through its due, most baleful, stages\r\n      of _Quack_ocracy; and a pestilential World be burnt up, and have\r\n      begun to grow green and young again.\r\n\r\n      Rejoice nevertheless, ye Versailles multitudes; to you, from whom\r\n      all this is hid, and glorious end of it is visible. This day,\r\n      sentence of death is pronounced on Shams; judgment of\r\n      resuscitation, were it but far off, is pronounced on Realities.\r\n      This day it is declared aloud, as with a Doom-trumpet, that a\r\n      _Lie is unbelievable_. Believe that, stand by that, if more there\r\n      be not; and let what thing or things soever will follow it\r\n      follow. “Ye can no other; God be your help!” So spake a greater\r\n      than any of you; opening _his_ Chapter of World-History.\r\n\r\n      Behold, however! The doors of St. Louis Church flung wide; and\r\n      the Procession of Processions advancing towards Notre-Dame!\r\n      Shouts rend the air; one shout, at which Grecian birds might drop\r\n      dead. It is indeed a stately, solemn sight. The Elected of\r\n      France, and then the Court of France; they are marshalled and\r\n      march there, all in prescribed place and costume. Our Commons “in\r\n      plain black mantle and white cravat;” Noblesse, in gold-worked,\r\n      bright-dyed cloaks of velvet, resplendent, rustling with laces,\r\n      waving with plumes; the Clergy in rochet, alb, or other best\r\n      _pontificalibus:_ lastly comes the King himself, and King’s\r\n      Household, also in their brightest blaze of pomp,—their brightest\r\n      and final one. Some Fourteen Hundred Men blown together from all\r\n      winds, on the deepest errand.\r\n\r\n      Yes, in that silent marching mass there lies Futurity enough. No\r\n      symbolic Ark, like the old Hebrews, do these men bear: yet with\r\n      them too is a Covenant; they too preside at a new Era in the\r\n      History of Men. The whole Future is there, and Destiny\r\n      dim-brooding over it; in the hearts and unshaped thoughts of\r\n      these men, it lies illegible, inevitable. Singular to think:\r\n      _they_ have it in them; yet not they, not mortal, only the Eye\r\n      above can read it,—as it shall unfold itself, in fire and\r\n      thunder, of siege, and field-artillery; in the rustling of\r\n      battle-banners, the tramp of hosts, in the glow of burning\r\n      cities, the shriek of strangled nations! Such things lie hidden,\r\n      safe-wrapt in this Fourth day of May;—say rather, had lain in\r\n      some other unknown day, of which this latter is the public fruit\r\n      and outcome. As indeed what wonders lie in every Day,—had we the\r\n      sight, as happily we have not, to decipher it: for is not every\r\n      meanest Day “the conflux of two Eternities!”\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, suppose we too, good Reader, should, as now without\r\n      miracle Muse Clio enables us—take _our_ station also on some\r\n      coign of vantage; and glance momentarily over this Procession,\r\n      and this Life-sea; with far other eyes than the rest do, namely\r\n      with prophetic? We can mount, and stand there, without fear of\r\n      falling.\r\n\r\n      As for the Life-sea, or onlooking unnumbered Multitude, it is\r\n      unfortunately all-too dim. Yet as we gaze fixedly, do not\r\n      nameless Figures not a few, which shall not always be nameless,\r\n      disclose themselves; visible or presumable there! Young Baroness\r\n      de Staël—she evidently looks from a window; among older\r\n      honourable women.[130] Her father is Minister, and one of the\r\n      gala personages; to his own eyes the chief one. Young spiritual\r\n      Amazon, thy rest is not there; nor thy loved Father’s: “as\r\n      Malebranche saw all things in God, so M. Necker sees all things\r\n      in Necker,”—a theorem that will not hold.\r\n\r\n      But where is the brown-locked, light-behaved, fire-hearted\r\n      Demoiselle Théroigne? Brown eloquent Beauty; who, with thy winged\r\n      words and glances, shalt thrill rough bosoms, whole steel\r\n      battalions, and persuade an Austrian Kaiser,—pike and helm lie\r\n      provided for thee in due season; and, alas, also strait-waistcoat\r\n      and long lodging in the Salpêtrière! Better hadst thou staid in\r\n      native Luxemburg, and been the mother of some brave man’s\r\n      children: but it was not thy task, it was not thy lot.\r\n\r\n      Of the rougher sex how, without tongue, or hundred tongues, of\r\n      iron, enumerate the notabilities! Has not Marquis Valadi hastily\r\n      quitted his quaker broadbrim; his Pythagorean Greek in Wapping,\r\n      and the city of Glasgow?[131] De Morande from his _Courrier de\r\n      l’Europe;_ Linguet from his _Annales_, they looked eager through\r\n      the London fog, and became Ex-Editors,—that they might feed the\r\n      guillotine, and have their due. Does Louvet (of _Faublas_) stand\r\n      a-tiptoe? And Brissot, hight De Warville, friend of the Blacks?\r\n      He, with Marquis Condorcet, and Clavière the Genevese “have\r\n      created the _Moniteur_ Newspaper,” or are about creating it. Able\r\n      Editors must give account of such a day.\r\n\r\n      Or seest thou with any distinctness, low down probably, not in\r\n      places of honour, a Stanislas Maillard, riding-tipstaff\r\n      (_huissier à cheval_) of the Châtelet; one of the shiftiest of\r\n      men? A Captain Hulin of Geneva, Captain Elie of the Queen’s\r\n      Regiment; both with an air of half-pay? Jourdan, with\r\n      tile-coloured whiskers, not yet with tile-beard; an unjust dealer\r\n      in mules? He shall be, in a few months, Jourdan the Headsman, and\r\n      have other work.\r\n\r\n      Surely also, in some place not of honour, stands or sprawls up\r\n      querulous, that he too, though short, may see,—one squalidest\r\n      bleared mortal, redolent of soot and horse-drugs: Jean Paul Marat\r\n      of Neuchâtel! O Marat, Renovator of Human Science, Lecturer on\r\n      Optics; O thou remarkablest Horseleech, once in D’Artois’\r\n      Stables,—as thy bleared soul looks forth, through thy bleared,\r\n      dull-acrid, wo-stricken face, what sees it in all this? Any\r\n      faintest light of hope; like dayspring after Nova-Zembla night?\r\n      Or is it but _blue_ sulphur-light, and spectres; woe, suspicion,\r\n      revenge without end?\r\n\r\n      Of Draper Lecointre, how he shut his cloth-shop hard by, and\r\n      stepped forth, one need hardly speak. Nor of Santerre, the\r\n      sonorous Brewer from the Faubourg St. Antoine. Two other Figures,\r\n      and only two, we signalise there. The huge, brawny, Figure;\r\n      through whose black brows, and rude flattened face (_figure\r\n      ecrasée_), there looks a waste energy as of Hercules not yet\r\n      furibund,—he is an esurient, unprovided Advocate; Danton by name:\r\n      him mark. Then that other, his slight-built comrade and\r\n      craft-brother; he with the long curling locks; with the face of\r\n      dingy blackguardism, wondrously irradiated with genius, as if a\r\n      naphtha-lamp burnt within it: that Figure is Camille Desmoulins.\r\n      A fellow of infinite shrewdness, wit, nay humour; one of the\r\n      sprightliest clearest souls in all these millions. Thou poor\r\n      Camille, say of thee what they may, it were but falsehood to\r\n      pretend one did not almost love thee, thou headlong\r\n      lightly-sparkling man! But the brawny, not yet furibund Figure,\r\n      we say, is Jacques Danton; a name that shall be “tolerably known\r\n      in the Revolution.” He is President of the electoral Cordeliers\r\n      District at Paris, or about to be it; and shall open his lungs of\r\n      brass.\r\n\r\n      We dwell no longer on the mixed shouting Multitude: for now,\r\n      behold, the Commons Deputies are at hand!\r\n\r\n      Which of these Six Hundred individuals, in plain white cravat,\r\n      that have come up to regenerate France, might one guess would\r\n      become their _king?_ For a king or leader they, as all bodies of\r\n      men, must have: be their work what it may, there is one man there\r\n      who, by character, faculty, position, is fittest of all to do it;\r\n      that man, as future not yet elected king, walks there among the\r\n      rest. He with the thick black locks, will it be? With the _hure_,\r\n      as himself calls it, or black _boar’s-head_, fit to be “shaken”\r\n      as a senatorial portent? Through whose shaggy beetle-brows, and\r\n      rough-hewn, seamed, carbuncled face, there look natural ugliness,\r\n      small-pox, incontinence, bankruptcy,—and burning fire of genius;\r\n      like comet-fire glaring fuliginous through murkiest confusions?\r\n      It is _Gabriel Honoré Riquetti de Mirabeau_, the world-compeller;\r\n      man-ruling Deputy of Aix! According to the Baroness de Staël, he\r\n      steps proudly along, though looked at askance here, and shakes\r\n      his black _chevelure_, or lion’s-mane; as if prophetic of great\r\n      deeds.\r\n\r\n      Yes, Reader, that is the Type-Frenchman of this epoch; as\r\n      Voltaire was of the last. He is French in his aspirations,\r\n      acquisitions, in his virtues, in his vices; perhaps more French\r\n      than any other man;—and intrinsically such a mass of manhood too.\r\n      Mark him well. The National Assembly were all different without\r\n      that one; nay, he might say with the old Despot: ‘The National\r\n      Assembly? I am that.’\r\n\r\n      Of a southern climate, of wild southern blood: for the Riquettis,\r\n      or Arighettis, had to fly from Florence and the Guelfs, long\r\n      centuries ago, and settled in Provence; where from generation to\r\n      generation they have ever approved themselves a peculiar kindred:\r\n      irascible, indomitable, sharp-cutting, true, like the steel they\r\n      wore; of an intensity and activity that sometimes verged towards\r\n      madness, yet did not reach it. One ancient Riquetti, in mad\r\n      fulfilment of a mad vow, chains two Mountains together; and the\r\n      chain, with its “iron star of five rays,” is still to be seen.\r\n      May not a modern Riquetti unchain so much, and set it\r\n      drifting,—which also shall be seen?\r\n\r\n      Destiny has work for that swart burly-headed Mirabeau; Destiny\r\n      has watched over him, prepared him from afar. Did not his\r\n      Grandfather, stout _Col-d’Argent_ (Silver-Stock, so they named\r\n      him), shattered and slashed by seven-and-twenty wounds in one\r\n      fell day lie sunk together on the Bridge at Casano; while Prince\r\n      Eugene’s cavalry galloped and regalloped over him,—only the\r\n      flying sergeant had thrown a camp-kettle over that loved head;\r\n      and Vendôme, dropping his spyglass, moaned out, “Mirabeau is\r\n      _dead_, then!” Nevertheless he was not dead: he awoke to breathe,\r\n      and miraculous surgery;—for Gabriel was yet to be. With his\r\n      silver _stock_ he kept his scarred head erect, through long\r\n      years; and wedded; and produced tough Marquis Victor, the _Friend\r\n      of Men_. Whereby at last in the appointed year 1749, this\r\n      long-expected rough-hewn Gabriel Honoré did likewise see the\r\n      light: roughest lion’s-whelp ever littered of that rough breed.\r\n      How the old lion (for our old Marquis too was lion-like, most\r\n      unconquerable, kingly-genial, most perverse) gazed wonderingly on\r\n      his offspring; and determined to train him as no lion had yet\r\n      been! It is in vain, O Marquis! This cub, though thou slay him\r\n      and flay him, will not learn to draw in dogcart of Political\r\n      Economy, and be a _Friend of Men;_ he will not be Thou, must and\r\n      will be Himself, another than Thou. Divorce lawsuits, “whole\r\n      family save one in prison, and three-score _Lettres-de-Cachet_”\r\n      for thy own sole use, do but astonish the world.\r\n\r\n      Our Luckless Gabriel, sinned against and sinning, has been in the\r\n      Isle of Rhe, and heard the Atlantic from his tower; in the Castle\r\n      of If, and heard the Mediterranean at Marseilles. He has been in\r\n      the Fortress of Joux; and forty-two months, with hardly clothing\r\n      to his back, in the Dungeon of Vincennes;—all by\r\n      _Lettre-de-Cachet_, from his lion father. He has been in\r\n      Pontarlier Jails (self-constituted prisoner); was noticed fording\r\n      estuaries of the sea (at low water), in flight from the face of\r\n      men. He has pleaded before Aix Parlements (to get back his wife);\r\n      the public gathering on roofs, to see since they could not hear:\r\n      ‘the clatter-teeth (_claque-dents_)!’ snarles singular old\r\n      Mirabeau; discerning in such admired forensic eloquence nothing\r\n      but two clattering jaw-bones, and a head vacant, sonorous, of the\r\n      drum species.\r\n\r\n      But as for Gabriel Honoré, in these strange wayfarings, what has\r\n      he not seen and tried! From drill-sergeants, to prime-ministers,\r\n      to foreign and domestic booksellers, all manner of men he has\r\n      seen. All manner of men he has gained; for at bottom it is a\r\n      social, loving heart, that wild unconquerable one:—more\r\n      especially all manner of women. From the Archer’s Daughter at\r\n      Saintes to that fair young Sophie Madame Monnier, whom he could\r\n      not but “steal,” and be beheaded for—in effigy! For indeed hardly\r\n      since the Arabian Prophet lay dead to Ali’s admiration, was there\r\n      seen such a Love-hero, with the strength of thirty men. In War,\r\n      again, he has helped to conquer Corsica; fought duels, irregular\r\n      brawls; horsewhipped calumnious barons. In Literature, he has\r\n      written on _Despotism_, on _Lettres-de-Cachet;_ Erotics\r\n      Sapphic-Werterean, Obscenities, Profanities; Books on the\r\n      _Prussian Monarchy_, on _Cagliostro_, on _Calonne_, on _the Water\r\n      Companies of Paris:_—each book comparable, we will say, to a\r\n      bituminous alarum-fire; huge, smoky, sudden! The firepan, the\r\n      kindling, the bitumen were his own; but the lumber, of rags, old\r\n      wood and nameless combustible rubbish (for all is fuel to him),\r\n      was gathered from huckster, and ass-panniers, of every\r\n      description under heaven. Whereby, indeed, hucksters enough have\r\n      been heard to exclaim: Out upon it, the fire is _mine!_\r\n\r\n      Nay, consider it more generally, seldom had man such a talent for\r\n      borrowing. The idea, the faculty of another man he can make his;\r\n      the man himself he can make his. ‘All reflex and echo (_tout de\r\n      reflet et de réverbère_)!’ snarls old Mirabeau, who can see, but\r\n      will not. Crabbed old Friend of Men! it is his sociality, his\r\n      aggregative nature; and will now be the quality of all for him.\r\n      In that forty-years “struggle against despotism,” he has gained\r\n      the glorious faculty of _self-help_, and yet not lost the\r\n      glorious natural gift of _fellowship_, of being helped. Rare\r\n      union! This man can live self-sufficing—yet lives also in the\r\n      life of other men; can make men love him, work with him: a born\r\n      king of men!\r\n\r\n      But consider further how, as the old Marquis still snarls, he has\r\n      ‘made away with (_humé_, swallowed) all _Formulas;_’—a fact\r\n      which, if we meditate it, will in these days mean much. This is\r\n      no man of system, then; he is only a man of instincts and\r\n      insights. A man nevertheless who will glare fiercely on any\r\n      object; and see through it, and conquer it: for he has intellect,\r\n      he has will, force beyond other men. A man not with\r\n      _logic-spectacles;_ but with an _eye!_ Unhappily without\r\n      Decalogue, moral Code or Theorem of any fixed sort; yet not\r\n      without a strong living Soul in him, and Sincerity there: a\r\n      Reality, not an Artificiality, not a Sham! And so he, having\r\n      struggled “forty years against despotism,” and “made away with\r\n      all formulas,” shall now become the spokesman of a Nation bent to\r\n      do the same. For is it not precisely the struggle of France also\r\n      to cast off despotism; to make away with _her_ old\r\n      formulas,—having found them naught, worn out, far from the\r\n      reality? She will make away with _such_ formulas;—and even go\r\n      _bare_, if need be, till she have found new ones.\r\n\r\n      Towards such work, in such manner, marches he, this singular\r\n      Riquetti Mirabeau. In fiery rough figure, with black Samson-locks\r\n      under the slouch-hat, he steps along there. A fiery fuliginous\r\n      mass, which could not be choked and smothered, but would fill all\r\n      France with smoke. And now it has got _air;_ it will burn its\r\n      whole substance, its whole smoke-atmosphere too, and fill all\r\n      France with flame. Strange lot! Forty years of that smouldering,\r\n      with foul fire-damp and vapour enough, then victory over\r\n      that;—and like a burning mountain he blazes heaven-high; and, for\r\n      twenty-three resplendent months, pours out, in flame and molten\r\n      fire-torrents, all that is in him, the Pharos and Wonder-sign of\r\n      an amazed Europe;—and then lies hollow, cold forever! Pass on,\r\n      thou questionable Gabriel Honoré, the greatest of them all: in\r\n      the whole National Deputies, in the whole Nation, there is none\r\n      like and none second to thee.\r\n\r\n      But now if Mirabeau is the greatest, who of these Six Hundred may\r\n      be the meanest? Shall we say, that anxious, slight,\r\n      ineffectual-looking man, under thirty, in spectacles; his eyes\r\n      (were the glasses off) troubled, careful; with upturned face,\r\n      snuffing dimly the uncertain future-time; complexion of a\r\n      multiplex atrabiliar colour, the final shade of which may be the\r\n      pale sea-green.[132] That greenish-coloured (_verdâtre_)\r\n      individual is an Advocate of Arras; his name is _Maximilien\r\n      Robespierre_. The son of an Advocate; his father founded\r\n      mason-lodges under Charles Edward, the English Prince or\r\n      Pretender. Maximilien the first-born was thriftily educated; he\r\n      had brisk Camille Desmoulins for schoolmate in the College of\r\n      Louis le Grand, at Paris. But he begged our famed\r\n      Necklace-Cardinal, Rohan, the patron, to let him depart thence,\r\n      and resign in favour of a younger brother. The strict-minded Max\r\n      departed; home to paternal Arras; and even had a Law-case there\r\n      and pleaded, not unsuccessfully, “in favour of the first Franklin\r\n      thunder-rod.” With a strict painful mind, an understanding small\r\n      but clear and ready, he grew in favour with official persons, who\r\n      could foresee in him an excellent man of business, happily quite\r\n      free from genius. The Bishop, therefore, taking counsel, appoints\r\n      him Judge of his diocese; and he faithfully does justice to the\r\n      people: till behold, one day, a culprit comes whose crime merits\r\n      hanging; and the strict-minded Max must abdicate, for his\r\n      conscience will not permit the dooming of any son of Adam to die.\r\n      A strict-minded, strait-laced man! A man unfit for Revolutions?\r\n      Whose small soul, transparent wholesome-looking as small ale,\r\n      could by no chance ferment into virulent _alegar_,—the mother of\r\n      ever new alegar; till all France were grown acetous virulent? We\r\n      shall see.\r\n\r\n      Between which two extremes of grandest and meanest, so many grand\r\n      and mean roll on, towards their several destinies, in that\r\n      Procession! There is _Cazalès_, the learned young soldier; who\r\n      shall become the eloquent orator of Royalism, and earn the shadow\r\n      of a name. Experienced _Mounier_, experienced _Malouet;_ whose\r\n      Presidential Parlementary experience the stream of things shall\r\n      soon leave stranded. A Pétion has left his gown and briefs at\r\n      Chartres for a stormier sort of pleading; has not forgotten his\r\n      violin, being fond of music. His hair is grizzled, though he is\r\n      still young: convictions, beliefs, placid-unalterable are in that\r\n      man; not hindmost of them, belief in himself. A\r\n      Protestant-clerical _Rabaut-St.-Etienne_, a slender young\r\n      eloquent and vehement _Barnave_, will help to regenerate France.\r\n      There are so many of them young. Till thirty the Spartans did not\r\n      suffer a man to marry: but how many men here under thirty; coming\r\n      to produce not one sufficient citizen, but a nation and a world\r\n      of such! The old to heal up rents; the young to remove\r\n      rubbish:—which latter, is it not, indeed, the task here?\r\n\r\n      Dim, formless from this distance, yet authentically there, thou\r\n      noticest the Deputies from Nantes? To us mere clothes-screens,\r\n      with slouch-hat and cloak, but bearing in their pocket a _Cahier_\r\n      of _doléances_ with this singular clause, and more such in it:\r\n      “That the master wigmakers of Nantes be not troubled with new\r\n      gild-brethren, the actually existing number of ninety-two being\r\n      more than sufficient!”[133] The Rennes people have elected Farmer\r\n      _Gérard_, “a man of natural sense and rectitude, without any\r\n      learning.” He walks there, with solid step; unique, “in his\r\n      rustic farmer-clothes;” which he will wear always; careless of\r\n      short-cloaks and costumes. The name Gérard, or “_Père Gérard_,\r\n      Father Gérard,” as they please to call him, will fly far; borne\r\n      about in endless banter; in Royalist satires, in Republican\r\n      didactic Almanacks.[134] As for the man Gerard, being asked once,\r\n      what he did, after trial of it, candidly think of this\r\n      Parlementary work,—‘I think,’ answered he, ‘that there are a good\r\n      many scoundrels among us.’ so walks Father Gérard; solid in his\r\n      thick shoes, whithersoever bound.\r\n\r\n      And worthy _Doctor Guillotin_, whom we hoped to behold one other\r\n      time? If not here, the Doctor should be here, and we see him with\r\n      the eye of prophecy: for indeed the Parisian Deputies are all a\r\n      little late. Singular Guillotin, respectable practitioner: doomed\r\n      by a satiric destiny to the strangest immortal glory that ever\r\n      kept obscure mortal from his resting-place, the bosom of\r\n      oblivion! Guillotin can improve the ventilation of the Hall; in\r\n      all cases of medical police and _hygiène_ be a present aid: but,\r\n      greater far, he can produce his “Report on the Penal Code;” and\r\n      reveal therein a cunningly devised Beheading Machine, which shall\r\n      become famous and world-famous. This is the product of\r\n      Guillotin’s endeavours, gained not without meditation and\r\n      reading; which product popular gratitude or levity christens by a\r\n      feminine derivative name, as if it were his daughter: _La\r\n      Guillotine!_ ‘With my machine, Messieurs, I whisk off your head\r\n      (_vous fais sauter la tête_) in a twinkling, and you have no\r\n      pain;’—whereat they all laugh.[135] Unfortunate Doctor! For\r\n      two-and-twenty years he, unguillotined, shall hear nothing but\r\n      guillotine, see nothing but guillotine; then dying, shall through\r\n      long centuries wander, as it were, a disconsolate ghost, on the\r\n      wrong side of Styx and Lethe; his name like to outlive Cæsar’s.\r\n\r\n      See _Bailly_, likewise of Paris, time-honoured Historian of\r\n      Astronomy Ancient and Modern. Poor Bailly, how thy serenely\r\n      beautiful Philosophising, with its soft moonshiny clearness and\r\n      thinness, ends in foul thick confusion—of Presidency, Mayorship,\r\n      diplomatic Officiality, rabid Triviality, and the throat of\r\n      everlasting Darkness! Far was it to descend from the heavenly\r\n      Galaxy to the _Drapeau Rouge:_ beside that fatal dung-heap, on\r\n      that last hell-day, thou must “tremble,” though only with cold,\r\n      “_de froid_.” Speculation is not practice: to be weak is not so\r\n      miserable; but to be weaker than our task. Wo the day when they\r\n      mounted thee, a peaceable pedestrian, on that wild Hippogriff of\r\n      a Democracy; which, spurning the firm earth, nay lashing at the\r\n      very _stars_, no yet known Astolpho could have ridden!\r\n\r\n      In the Commons Deputies there are Merchants, Artists, Men of\r\n      Letters; three hundred and seventy-four Lawyers;[136] and at\r\n      least one Clergyman: the _Abbé Sieyes_. Him also Paris sends,\r\n      among its twenty. Behold him, the light thin man; cold, but\r\n      elastic, wiry; instinct with the pride of Logic; passionless, or\r\n      with but one passion, that of self-conceit. If indeed that can be\r\n      called a passion, which, in its independent concentrated\r\n      greatness, seems to have soared into transcendentalism; and to\r\n      sit there with a kind of godlike indifference, and look down on\r\n      passion! He is the man, and wisdom shall die with him. This is\r\n      the Sieyes who shall be System-builder, Constitution-builder\r\n      General; and build Constitutions (as many as wanted)\r\n      skyhigh,—which shall all unfortunately fall before he get the\r\n      scaffolding away. ‘_La Politique_,’ said he to Dumont, ‘Polity is\r\n      a science I think I have completed (_achevée_).’[137] What\r\n      things, O Sieyes, with thy clear assiduous eyes, art thou to see!\r\n      But were it not curious to know how Sieyes, now in these days\r\n      (for he is said to be still alive)[138] looks out on all that\r\n      Constitution masonry, through the rheumy soberness of extreme\r\n      age? Might we hope, still with the old irrefragable\r\n      transcendentalism? The victorious cause pleased the gods, the\r\n      vanquished one pleased Sieyes (_victa Catoni_).\r\n\r\n      Thus, however, amid skyrending vivats, and blessings from every\r\n      heart, has the Procession of the Commons Deputies rolled by.\r\n\r\n      Next follow the Noblesse, and next the Clergy; concerning both of\r\n      whom it might be asked, What they specially have come for?\r\n      Specially, little as they dream of it, to answer this question,\r\n      put in a voice of thunder: What are you doing in God’s fair Earth\r\n      and Task-garden; where whosoever is not working is begging or\r\n      stealing? Wo, wo to themselves and to all, if they can only\r\n      answer: Collecting tithes, Preserving game!—Remark, meanwhile,\r\n      how _D’Orléans_ affects to step before his own Order, and mingle\r\n      with the Commons. For him are _vivats:_ few for the rest, though\r\n      all wave in plumed “hats of a feudal cut,” and have sword on\r\n      thigh; though among them is _D’Antraigues_, the young\r\n      Languedocian gentleman,—and indeed many a Peer more or less\r\n      noteworthy.\r\n\r\n      There are _Liancourt_, and _La Rochefoucault;_ the liberal\r\n      Anglomaniac Dukes. There is a filially pious _Lally;_ a couple of\r\n      liberal _Lameths_. Above all, there is a _Lafayette;_ whose name\r\n      shall be Cromwell-Grandison, and fill the world. Many a “formula”\r\n      has this Lafayette too made away with; yet not _all_ formulas. He\r\n      sticks by the Washington-formula; and by that he will stick;—and\r\n      hang by it, as by sure bower-anchor hangs and swings the tight\r\n      war-ship, which, after all changes of wildest weather and water,\r\n      is found still hanging. Happy for him; be it glorious or not!\r\n      Alone of all Frenchmen he has a theory of the world, and right\r\n      mind to conform thereto; he can become a hero and perfect\r\n      character, were it but the hero of one idea. Note further our old\r\n      Parlementary friend, _Crispin-Catiline d’Espréménil_. He is\r\n      returned from the Mediterranean Islands, a redhot royalist,\r\n      repentant to the finger-ends;—unsettled-looking; whose light,\r\n      dusky-glowing at best, now flickers foul in the socket; whom the\r\n      National Assembly will by and by, to save time, “regard as in a\r\n      state of distraction.” Note lastly that globular _Younger_\r\n      Mirabeau; indignant that his elder Brother is among the Commons:\r\n      it is _Viscomte_ Mirabeau; named oftener Mirabeau _Tonneau_\r\n      (Barrel Mirabeau), on account of his rotundity, and the\r\n      quantities of strong liquor he contains.\r\n\r\n      There then walks our French Noblesse. All in the old pomp of\r\n      chivalry: and yet, alas, how changed from the old position;\r\n      drifted far down from their native latitude, like Arctic icebergs\r\n      got into the Equatorial sea, and fast thawing there! Once these\r\n      Chivalry _Duces_ (Dukes, as they are still named) did actually\r\n      _lead_ the world,—were it only towards battle-spoil, where lay\r\n      the world’s best wages then: moreover, being the ablest Leaders\r\n      going, they had their lion’s share, those _Duces;_ which none\r\n      could grudge them. But now, when so many Looms, improved\r\n      Ploughshares, Steam-Engines and Bills of Exchange have been\r\n      invented; and, for battle-brawling itself, men hire\r\n      Drill-Sergeants at eighteen-pence a-day,—what mean these\r\n      goldmantled Chivalry Figures, walking there “in black-velvet\r\n      cloaks,” in high-plumed “hats of a feudal cut”? Reeds shaken in\r\n      the wind!\r\n\r\n      The Clergy have got up; with _Cahiers_ for abolishing\r\n      pluralities, enforcing residence of bishops, better payment of\r\n      tithes.[139] The Dignitaries, we can observe, walk stately, apart\r\n      from the numerous Undignified,—who indeed are properly little\r\n      other than Commons disguised in Curate-frocks. Here, however,\r\n      though by strange ways, shall the Precept be fulfilled, and they\r\n      that are greatest (much to their astonishment) become least. For\r\n      one example, out of many, mark that plausible _Grégoire:_ one day\r\n      Curé Grégoire shall be a Bishop, when the now stately are\r\n      wandering distracted, as Bishops _in partibus_. With other\r\n      thought, mark also the _Abbé Maury:_ his broad bold face; mouth\r\n      accurately primmed; full eyes, that ray out intelligence,\r\n      falsehood,—the sort of sophistry which is astonished you should\r\n      find it sophistical. Skilfulest vamper-up of old rotten leather,\r\n      to make it look like new; always a rising man; he used to tell\r\n      Mercier, ‘You will see; I shall be in the Academy before\r\n      you.’[140] Likely indeed, thou skilfullest Maury; nay thou shalt\r\n      have a Cardinal’s Hat, and plush and glory; but alas, also, in\r\n      the longrun—mere oblivion, like the rest of us; and six feet of\r\n      earth! What boots it, vamping rotten leather on these terms?\r\n      Glorious in comparison is the livelihood thy good old Father\r\n      earns, by making shoes,—one may hope, in a sufficient manner.\r\n      Maury does not want for audacity. He shall wear pistols, by and\r\n      by; and at death-cries of ‘_La Lanterne_, The Lamp-iron;’ answer\r\n      coolly, ‘Friends, will you see better there?’\r\n\r\n      But yonder, halting lamely along, thou noticest next _Bishop\r\n      Talleyrand-Perigord_, his Reverence of Autun. A sardonic grimness\r\n      lies in that irreverent Reverence of Autun. He will do and suffer\r\n      strange things; and will _become_ surely one of the strangest\r\n      things ever seen, or like to be seen. A man living in falsehood,\r\n      and on falsehood; yet not what you can call a false man: there is\r\n      the specialty! It will be an enigma for future ages, one may\r\n      hope: hitherto such a product of Nature and Art was possible only\r\n      for this age of ours,—Age of Paper, and of the Burning of Paper.\r\n      Consider Bishop Talleyrand and Marquis Lafayette as the topmost\r\n      of their two kinds; and say once more, looking at what they did\r\n      and what they were, _O Tempus ferax rerum!_\r\n\r\n      On the whole, however, has not this unfortunate Clergy also\r\n      drifted in the Time-stream, far from its native latitude? An\r\n      anomalous mass of men; of whom the whole world has already a dim\r\n      understanding that it can understand nothing. They were once a\r\n      Priesthood, interpreters of Wisdom, revealers of the Holy that is\r\n      in Man: a true _Clerus_ (or Inheritance of God on Earth): but\r\n      now?—They pass silently, with such _Cahiers_ as they have been\r\n      able to redact; and none cries, God bless them.\r\n\r\n      King Louis with his Court brings up the rear: he cheerful, in\r\n      this day of hope, is saluted with plaudits; still more Necker his\r\n      Minister. Not so the Queen; on whom hope shines not steadily any\r\n      more. Ill-fated Queen! Her hair is already gray with many cares\r\n      and crosses; her first-born son is dying in these weeks: black\r\n      falsehood has ineffaceably soiled her name; ineffaceably while\r\n      this generation lasts. Instead of _Vive la Reine_, voices insult\r\n      her with _Vive d’Orléans_. Of her queenly beauty little remains\r\n      except its stateliness; not now gracious, but haughty, rigid,\r\n      silently enduring. With a most mixed feeling, wherein joy has no\r\n      part, she resigns herself to a day she hoped never to have seen.\r\n      Poor Marie Antoinette; with thy quick noble instincts; vehement\r\n      glancings, vision all-too fitful narrow for the work thou hast to\r\n      do! O there are tears in store for thee; bitterest wailings, soft\r\n      womanly meltings, though thou hast the heart of an imperial\r\n      Theresa’s Daughter. Thou doomed one, shut thy eyes on the\r\n      future!—\r\n\r\n      And so, in stately Procession, have passed the Elected of France.\r\n      Some towards honour and quick fire-consummation; most towards\r\n      dishonour; not a few towards massacre, confusion, emigration,\r\n      desperation: all towards Eternity!—So many heterogeneities cast\r\n      together into the fermenting-vat; there, with incalculable\r\n      action, counteraction, elective affinities, explosive\r\n      developments, to work out healing for a sick moribund System of\r\n      Society! Probably the strangest Body of Men, if we consider well,\r\n      that ever met together on our Planet on such an errand. So\r\n      thousandfold complex a Society, ready to burst-up from its\r\n      infinite depths; and these men, its rulers and healers, without\r\n      life-rule for themselves,—other life-rule than a Gospel according\r\n      to Jean Jacques! To the wisest of them, what we must call the\r\n      wisest, man is properly an Accident under the sky. Man is without\r\n      Duty round him; except it be “to make the Constitution.” He is\r\n      without Heaven above him, or Hell beneath him; he has no God in\r\n      the world.\r\n\r\n      What further or better belief can be said to exist in these\r\n      Twelve Hundred? Belief in high-plumed hats of a feudal cut; in\r\n      heraldic scutcheons; in the divine right of Kings, in the divine\r\n      right of Game-destroyers. Belief, or what is still worse, canting\r\n      half-belief; or worst of all, mere Macchiavellic\r\n      pretence-of-belief,—in consecrated dough-wafers, and the godhood\r\n      of a poor old Italian Man! Nevertheless in that immeasurable\r\n      Confusion and Corruption, which struggles there so blindly to\r\n      become less confused and corrupt, there is, as we said, this one\r\n      salient point of a New Life discernible: the deep fixed\r\n      Determination to have done with Shams. A determination, which,\r\n      consciously or unconsciously, is _fixed;_ which waxes ever more\r\n      fixed, into very madness and fixed-idea; which in such embodiment\r\n      as lies provided there, shall now unfold itself rapidly:\r\n      monstrous, stupendous, unspeakable; new for long thousands of\r\n      years!—How has the Heaven’s _light_, oftentimes in this Earth, to\r\n      clothe itself in thunder and electric murkiness; and descend as\r\n      molten _lightning_, blasting, if purifying! Nay is it not rather\r\n      the very murkiness, and atmospheric suffocation, that _brings_\r\n      the lightning and the light? The new Evangel, as the old had\r\n      been, was it to be born in the Destruction of a World?\r\n\r\n      But how the Deputies assisted at High Mass, and heard sermon, and\r\n      applauded the preacher, church as it was, when he preached\r\n      politics; how, next day, with sustained pomp, they are, for the\r\n      first time, installed in their _Salles des Menus_ (Hall no longer\r\n      of _Amusements_), and become a States-General,—readers can fancy\r\n      for themselves. The King from his _estrade_, gorgeous as Solomon\r\n      in all his glory, runs his eye over that majestic Hall;\r\n      many-plumed, many-glancing; bright-tinted as rainbow, in the\r\n      galleries and near side spaces, where Beauty sits raining bright\r\n      influence. Satisfaction, as of one that after long voyaging had\r\n      got to port, plays over his broad simple face: the innocent King!\r\n      He rises and speaks, with sonorous tone, a conceivable speech.\r\n      With which, still more with the succeeding one-hour and two-hour\r\n      speeches of Garde-des-Sceaux and M. Necker, full of nothing but\r\n      patriotism, hope, faith, and deficiency of the revenue,—no reader\r\n      of these pages shall be tried.\r\n\r\n      We remark only that, as his Majesty, on finishing the speech, put\r\n      on his plumed hat, and the Noblesse according to custom imitated\r\n      him, our Tiers-Etat Deputies did mostly, not without a shade of\r\n      fierceness, in like manner clap-on, and even crush on their\r\n      slouched hats; and stand there awaiting the issue.[141] Thick\r\n      buzz among them, between majority and minority of _Couvrezvous,\r\n      Décrouvrez-vous_ (Hats off, Hats on)! To which his Majesty puts\r\n      end, by taking _off_ his own royal hat again.\r\n\r\n      The session terminates without further accident or omen than\r\n      this; with which, significantly enough, France has opened her\r\n      States-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 1.V.\r\n      THE THIRD ESTATE\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.I.\r\n      Inertia.\r\n\r\n      That exasperated France, in this same National Assembly of hers,\r\n      has got something, nay something great, momentous, indispensable,\r\n      cannot be doubted; yet still the question were: Specially _what?_\r\n      A question hard to solve, even for calm onlookers at this\r\n      distance; wholly insoluble to actors in the middle of it. The\r\n      States-General, created and conflated by the passionate effort of\r\n      the whole nation, is there as a thing high and lifted up. Hope,\r\n      jubilating, cries aloud that it will prove a miraculous Brazen\r\n      Serpent in the Wilderness; whereon whosoever looks, with faith\r\n      and obedience, shall be healed of all woes and serpent-bites.\r\n\r\n      We may answer, it will at least prove a symbolic Banner; round\r\n      which the exasperating complaining Twenty-Five Millions,\r\n      otherwise isolated and without power, may rally, and work—what it\r\n      is in them to work. If battle must be the work, as one cannot\r\n      help expecting, then shall it be a battle-banner (say, an Italian\r\n      Gonfalon, in its old Republican _Carroccio_); and shall tower up,\r\n      car-borne, shining in the wind: and with iron tongue peal forth\r\n      many a signal. A thing of prime necessity; which whether in the\r\n      van or in the centre, whether leading or led and driven, must do\r\n      the fighting multitude incalculable services. For a season, while\r\n      it floats in the very front, nay as it were stands solitary\r\n      there, waiting whether force will gather round it, this same\r\n      National _Carroccio_, and the signal-peals it rings, are a main\r\n      object with us.\r\n\r\n      The omen of the “slouch-hats clapt on” shows the Commons Deputies\r\n      to have made up their minds on one thing: that neither Noblesse\r\n      nor Clergy shall have precedence of them; hardly even Majesty\r\n      itself. To such length has the _Contrat Social_, and force of\r\n      public opinion, carried us. For what is Majesty but the Delegate\r\n      of the Nation; delegated, and bargained with (even rather\r\n      tightly),—in some very singular posture of affairs, which Jean\r\n      Jacques has not fixed the date of?\r\n\r\n      Coming therefore into their Hall, on the morrow, an inorganic\r\n      mass of Six Hundred individuals, these Commons Deputies perceive,\r\n      without terror, that they have it all to themselves. Their Hall\r\n      is also the Grand or general Hall for all the Three Orders. But\r\n      the Noblesse and Clergy, it would seem, have retired to their two\r\n      separate Apartments, or Halls; and are there “verifying their\r\n      powers,” not in a conjoint but in a separate capacity. They are\r\n      to constitute two separate, perhaps separately-voting Orders,\r\n      then? It is as if both Noblesse and Clergy had silently taken for\r\n      granted that they already were such! Two Orders against one; and\r\n      so the Third Order to be left in a perpetual minority?\r\n\r\n      Much may remain unfixed; but the negative of that is a thing\r\n      fixed: in the Slouch-hatted heads, in the French Nation’s head.\r\n      Double representation, and all else hitherto gained, were\r\n      otherwise futile, null. Doubtless, the “powers must be\r\n      verified;”—doubtless, the Commission, the electoral Documents of\r\n      your Deputy must be inspected by his brother Deputies, and found\r\n      valid: it is the preliminary of all. Neither is this question, of\r\n      doing it separately or doing it conjointly, a vital one: but if\r\n      it lead to such? It must be resisted; wise was that maxim, Resist\r\n      the beginnings! Nay were resistance unadvisable, even dangerous,\r\n      yet surely pause is very natural: pause, with Twenty-five\r\n      Millions behind you, may become resistance enough.—The inorganic\r\n      mass of Commons Deputies will restrict itself to a “system of\r\n      inertia,” and for the present remain inorganic.\r\n\r\n      Such method, recommendable alike to sagacity and to timidity, do\r\n      the Commons Deputies adopt; and, not without adroitness, and with\r\n      ever more tenacity, they persist in it, day after day, week after\r\n      week. For six weeks their history is of the kind named barren;\r\n      which indeed, as Philosophy knows, is often the fruitfulest of\r\n      all. These were their still creation-days; wherein they sat\r\n      incubating! In fact, what they did was to do nothing, in a\r\n      judicious manner. Daily the inorganic body reassembles; regrets\r\n      that they cannot get organisation, “verification of powers in\r\n      common, and begin regenerating France. Headlong motions may be\r\n      made, but let such be repressed; inertia alone is at once\r\n      unpunishable and unconquerable.\r\n\r\n      Cunning must be met by cunning; proud pretension by inertia, by a\r\n      low tone of patriotic sorrow; low, but incurable, unalterable.\r\n      Wise as serpents; harmless as doves: what a spectacle for France!\r\n      Six Hundred inorganic individuals, essential for its regeneration\r\n      and salvation, sit there, on their elliptic benches, longing\r\n      passionately towards life; in painful durance; like souls waiting\r\n      to be born. Speeches are spoken; eloquent; audible within doors\r\n      and without. Mind agitates itself against mind; the Nation looks\r\n      on with ever deeper interest. Thus do the Commons Deputies sit\r\n      incubating.\r\n\r\n      There are private conclaves, supper-parties, consultations;\r\n      Breton Club, Club of Viroflay; germs of many Clubs. Wholly an\r\n      element of confused noise, dimness, angry heat;—wherein, however,\r\n      the Eros-egg, kept at the fit temperature, may hover safe,\r\n      unbroken till it be hatched. In your Mouniers, Malouets,\r\n      Lechapeliers in science sufficient for that; fervour in your\r\n      Barnaves, Rabauts. At times shall come an inspiration from royal\r\n      Mirabeau: he is nowise yet recognised as royal; nay he was\r\n      “groaned at,” when his name was first mentioned: but he is\r\n      struggling towards recognition.\r\n\r\n      In the course of the week, the Commons having called their Eldest\r\n      to the chair, and furnished him with young stronger-lunged\r\n      assistants,—can speak articulately; and, in audible lamentable\r\n      words, declare, as we said, that they are an inorganic body,\r\n      longing to become organic. Letters arrive; but an inorganic body\r\n      cannot open letters; they lie on the table unopened. The Eldest\r\n      may at most procure for himself some kind of List or Muster-roll,\r\n      to take the votes by, and wait what will betide. Noblesse and\r\n      Clergy are all elsewhere: however, an eager public crowds all\r\n      galleries and vacancies; which is some comfort. With effort, it\r\n      is determined, not that a Deputation shall be sent,—for how can\r\n      an inorganic body send deputations?—but that certain individual\r\n      Commons Members shall, in an accidental way, stroll into the\r\n      Clergy Chamber, and then into the Noblesse one; and mention\r\n      there, as a thing they have happened to observe, that the Commons\r\n      seem to be sitting waiting for them, in order to verify their\r\n      powers. That is the wiser method!\r\n\r\n      The Clergy, among whom are such a multitude of Undignified, of\r\n      mere Commons in Curates’ frocks, depute instant respectful answer\r\n      that they are, and will now more than ever be, in deepest study\r\n      as to that very matter. Contrariwise the Noblesse, in cavalier\r\n      attitude, reply, after four days, that they, for their part, are\r\n      all verified and constituted; which, they had trusted, the\r\n      Commons also were; such _separate_ verification being clearly the\r\n      proper constitutional wisdom-of-ancestors method;—as they the\r\n      Noblesse will have much pleasure in demonstrating by a Commission\r\n      of their number, if the Commons will meet them, Commission\r\n      against Commission! Directly in the rear of which comes a\r\n      deputation of Clergy, reiterating, in their insidious\r\n      conciliatory way, the same proposal. Here, then, is a complexity:\r\n      what will wise Commons say to this?\r\n\r\n      Warily, inertly, the wise Commons, considering that they are, if\r\n      not a French Third Estate, at least an Aggregate of individuals\r\n      pretending to some title of that kind, determine, after talking\r\n      on it five days, to name such a Commission,—though, as it were,\r\n      with proviso not to be convinced: a sixth day is taken up in\r\n      naming it; a seventh and an eighth day in getting the forms of\r\n      meeting, place, hour and the like, settled: so that it is not\r\n      till the evening of the 23rd of May that Noblesse Commission\r\n      first meets Commons Commission, Clergy acting as Conciliators;\r\n      and begins the impossible task of convincing it. One other\r\n      meeting, on the 25th, will suffice: the Commons are\r\n      inconvincible, the Noblesse and Clergy irrefragably convincing;\r\n      the Commissions retire; each Order persisting in its first\r\n      pretensions.[142]\r\n\r\n      Thus have three weeks passed. For three weeks, the Third-Estate\r\n      Carroccio, with far-seen Gonfalon, has stood stockstill, flouting\r\n      the wind; waiting what force would gather round it.\r\n\r\n      Fancy can conceive the feeling of the Court; and how counsel met\r\n      counsel, the loud-sounding inanity whirled in that distracted\r\n      vortex, where wisdom could not dwell. Your cunningly devised\r\n      Taxing-Machine has been got together; set up with incredible\r\n      labour; and stands there, its three pieces in contact; its two\r\n      fly-wheels of Noblesse and Clergy, its huge working-wheel of\r\n      Tiers-Etat. The two fly-wheels whirl in the softest manner; but,\r\n      prodigious to look upon, the huge working-wheel hangs motionless,\r\n      refuses to stir! The cunningest engineers are at fault. How\r\n      _will_ it work, when it does begin? Fearfully, my Friends; and to\r\n      many purposes; but to gather taxes, or grind court-meal, one may\r\n      apprehend, never. Could we but have continued gathering taxes _by\r\n      hand!_ Messeigneurs d’Artois, Conti, Condé (named Court\r\n      Triumvirate), they of the anti-democratic _Mémoire au Roi_, has\r\n      not their foreboding proved true? They may wave reproachfully\r\n      their high heads; they may beat their poor brains; but the\r\n      cunningest engineers can do nothing. Necker himself, were he even\r\n      listened to, begins to look blue. The only thing one sees\r\n      advisable is to bring up soldiers. New regiments, two, and a\r\n      battalion of a third, have already reached Paris; others shall\r\n      get in march. Good were it, in all circumstances, to have troops\r\n      within reach; good that the command were in sure hands. Let\r\n      Broglie be appointed; old Marshal Duke de Broglie; veteran\r\n      disciplinarian, of a firm drill-sergeant morality, such as may be\r\n      depended on.\r\n\r\n      For, alas, neither are the Clergy, or the very Noblesse what they\r\n      should be; and might be, when so menaced from without: entire,\r\n      undivided within. The Noblesse, indeed, have their Catiline or\r\n      Crispin D’Espréménil, dusky-glowing, all in renegade heat; their\r\n      boisterous Barrel-Mirabeau; but also they have their Lafayettes,\r\n      Liancourts, Lameths; above all, their D’Orléans, now cut forever\r\n      from his Court-moorings, and musing drowsily of high and highest\r\n      sea-prizes (for is not he too a son of Henri Quatre, and partial\r\n      potential Heir-Apparent?)—on his voyage towards Chaos. From the\r\n      Clergy again, so numerous are the Curés, actual deserters have\r\n      run over: two small parties; in the second party Curé Gregoire.\r\n      Nay there is talk of a whole Hundred and Forty-nine of them about\r\n      to desert in mass, and only restrained by an Archbishop of Paris.\r\n      It seems a losing game.\r\n\r\n      But judge if France, if Paris sat idle, all this while! Addresses\r\n      from far and near flow in: for our Commons have now grown organic\r\n      enough to open letters. Or indeed to cavil at them! Thus poor\r\n      Marquis de Brézé, Supreme Usher, Master of Ceremonies, or\r\n      whatever his title was, writing about this time on some\r\n      ceremonial matter, sees no harm in winding up with a “Monsieur,\r\n      yours with sincere attachment.”—‘To whom does it address itself,\r\n      this sincere attachment?’ inquires Mirabeau. ‘To the Dean of the\r\n      Tiers-Etat.’—‘There is no man in France entitled to write that,’\r\n      rejoins he; whereat the Galleries and the World will not be kept\r\n      from applauding.[143] Poor De Brézé! These Commons have a still\r\n      older grudge at him; nor has he yet done with them.\r\n\r\n      In another way, Mirabeau has had to protest against the quick\r\n      suppression of his Newspaper, _Journal of the\r\n      States-General;_—and to continue it under a new name. In which\r\n      act of valour, the Paris Electors, still busy redacting their\r\n      _Cahier_, could not but support him, by Address to his Majesty:\r\n      they claim utmost “provisory freedom of the press;” they have\r\n      spoken even about demolishing the Bastille, and erecting a Bronze\r\n      Patriot King on the site!—These are the rich Burghers: but now\r\n      consider how it went, for example, with such loose miscellany,\r\n      now all grown eleutheromaniac, of Loungers, Prowlers, social\r\n      Nondescripts (and the distilled Rascality of our Planet), as\r\n      whirls forever in the Palais Royal;—or what low infinite groan,\r\n      first changing into a growl, comes from Saint-Antoine, and the\r\n      Twenty-five Millions in danger of starvation!\r\n\r\n      There is the indisputablest scarcity of corn;—be it\r\n      Aristocrat-plot, D’Orléans-plot, of this year; or drought and\r\n      hail of last year: in city and province, the poor man looks\r\n      desolately towards a nameless lot. And this States-General, that\r\n      could make us an age of gold, is forced to stand motionless;\r\n      cannot get its powers verified! All industry necessarily\r\n      languishes, if it be not that of making motions.\r\n\r\n      In the Palais Royal there has been erected, apparently by\r\n      subscription, a kind of Wooden Tent (_en planches de\r\n      bois_);[144]—most convenient; where select Patriotism can now\r\n      redact resolutions, deliver harangues, with comfort, let the\r\n      weather but as it will. Lively is that Satan-at-Home! On his\r\n      table, on his chair, in every _café_, stands a patriotic orator;\r\n      a crowd round him within; a crowd listening from without,\r\n      open-mouthed, through open door and window; with “thunders of\r\n      applause for every sentiment of more than common hardiness.” In\r\n      Monsieur Dessein’s Pamphlet-shop, close by, you cannot without\r\n      strong elbowing get to the counter: every hour produces its\r\n      pamphlet, or litter of pamphlets; “there were thirteen today,\r\n      sixteen yesterday, nine-two last week.”[145] Think of Tyranny and\r\n      Scarcity; Fervid-eloquence, Rumour, Pamphleteering; _Societé\r\n      Publicole_, Breton Club, Enraged Club;—and whether every\r\n      tap-room, coffee-room, social reunion, accidental street-group,\r\n      over wide France, was not an Enraged Club!\r\n\r\n      To all which the Commons Deputies can only listen with a sublime\r\n      inertia of sorrow; reduced to busy themselves “with their\r\n      internal police.” Surer position no Deputies ever occupied; if\r\n      they keep it with skill. Let not the temperature rise too high;\r\n      break not the Eros-egg till it be hatched, till it break itself!\r\n      An eager public crowds all Galleries and vacancies! “cannot be\r\n      restrained from applauding.” The two Privileged Orders, the\r\n      Noblesse all verified and constituted, may look on with what face\r\n      they will; not without a secret tremor of heart. The Clergy,\r\n      always acting the part of conciliators, make a clutch at the\r\n      Galleries, and the popularity there; and miss it. Deputation of\r\n      them arrives, with dolorous message about the “dearth of grains,”\r\n      and the necessity there is of casting aside vain formalities, and\r\n      deliberating on this. An insidious proposal; which, however, the\r\n      Commons (moved thereto by seagreen Robespierre) dexterously\r\n      accept as a sort of hint, or even pledge, that the Clergy will\r\n      forthwith come over to them, constitute the States-General, and\r\n      so cheapen grains![146]—Finally, on the 27th day of May,\r\n      Mirabeau, judging the time now nearly come, proposes that “the\r\n      inertia cease;” that, leaving the Noblesse to their own stiff\r\n      ways, the Clergy be summoned, “in the name of the God of Peace,”\r\n      to join the Commons, and begin.[147] To which summons if they\r\n      turn a deaf ear,—we shall see! Are not one Hundred and Forty-nine\r\n      of them ready to desert?\r\n\r\n      O Triumvirate of Princes, new Garde-des-Sceaux Barentin, thou\r\n      Home-Secretary Bréteuil, Duchess Polignac, and Queen eager to\r\n      listen,—what is now to be done? This Third Estate will get in\r\n      motion, with the force of all France in it; Clergy-machinery with\r\n      Noblesse-machinery, which were to serve as beautiful\r\n      counter-balances and drags, will be shamefully dragged after\r\n      it,—and take fire along with it. What is to be done? The\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf waxes more confused than ever. Whisper and\r\n      counter-whisper; a very tempest of whispers! Leading men from all\r\n      the Three Orders are nightly spirited thither; conjurors many of\r\n      them; but can they conjure this? Necker himself were now welcome,\r\n      could he interfere to purpose.\r\n\r\n      Let Necker interfere, then; and in the King’s name! Happily that\r\n      incendiary “God-of-Peace” message is not yet _answered_. The\r\n      Three Orders shall again have conferences; under this Patriot\r\n      Minister of theirs, somewhat may be healed, clouted up;—we\r\n      meanwhile getting forward Swiss Regiments, and a “hundred pieces\r\n      of field-artillery.” This is what the Œil-de-Bœuf, for its part,\r\n      resolves on.\r\n\r\n      But as for Necker—Alas, poor Necker, thy obstinate Third Estate\r\n      has one first-last word, _verification in common_, as the pledge\r\n      of voting and deliberating in common! Half-way proposals, from\r\n      such a tried friend, they answer with a stare. The tardy\r\n      conferences speedily break up; the Third Estate, now ready and\r\n      resolute, the whole world backing it, returns to its Hall of the\r\n      Three Orders; and Necker to the Œil-de-Bœuf, with the character\r\n      of a disconjured conjuror there—fit only for dismissal.[148]\r\n\r\n      And so the Commons Deputies are at last on their own strength\r\n      getting under way? Instead of Chairman, or Dean, they have now\r\n      got a President: Astronomer Bailly. Under way, with a vengeance!\r\n      With endless vociferous and temperate eloquence, borne on\r\n      Newspaper wings to all lands, they have now, on this 17th day of\r\n      June, determined that their name is not _Third Estate_,\r\n      but—_National Assembly!_ They, then, are the Nation? Triumvirate\r\n      of Princes, Queen, refractory Noblesse and Clergy, what, then,\r\n      are _you?_ A most deep question;—scarcely answerable in living\r\n      political dialects.\r\n\r\n      All regardless of which, our new National Assembly proceeds to\r\n      appoint a “committee of subsistences;” dear to France, though it\r\n      can find little or no grain. Next, as if our National Assembly\r\n      stood quite firm on its legs,—to appoint “four other standing\r\n      committees;” then to settle the security of the National Debt;\r\n      then that of the Annual Taxation: all within eight-and-forty\r\n      hours. At such rate of velocity it is going: the conjurors of the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf may well ask themselves, Whither?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.II.\r\n      Mercury de Brézé.\r\n\r\n      Now surely were the time for a “god from the machine;” there is a\r\n      _nodus_ worthy of one. The only question is, Which god? Shall it\r\n      be Mars de Broglie, with his hundred pieces of cannon?—Not yet,\r\n      answers prudence; so soft, irresolute is King Louis. Let it be\r\n      Messenger _Mercury_, our Supreme Usher de Brézé.\r\n\r\n      On the morrow, which is the 20th of June, these Hundred and\r\n      Forty-nine false Curates, no longer restrainable by his Grace of\r\n      Paris, will desert in a body: let De Brézé intervene, and\r\n      produce—closed doors! Not only shall there be Royal Session, in\r\n      that Salle des Menus; but no meeting, nor working (except by\r\n      carpenters), till then. Your Third Estate, self-styled “National\r\n      Assembly,” shall suddenly see itself extruded from its Hall, by\r\n      carpenters, in this dexterous way; and reduced to do nothing, not\r\n      even to meet, or articulately lament,—till Majesty, with _Séance\r\n      Royale_ and new miracles, be ready! In this manner shall De\r\n      Brézé, as Mercury _ex machinâ_, intervene; and, if the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf mistake not, work deliverance from the _nodus_.\r\n\r\n      Of poor De Brézé we can remark that he has yet prospered in none\r\n      of his dealings with these Commons. Five weeks ago, when they\r\n      kissed the hand of Majesty, the mode he took got nothing but\r\n      censure; and then his “sincere attachment,” how was it scornfully\r\n      whiffed aside! Before supper, this night, he writes to President\r\n      Bailly, a new Letter, to be delivered shortly after dawn\r\n      tomorrow, in the King’s name. Which Letter, however, Bailly in\r\n      the pride of office, will merely crush together into his pocket,\r\n      like a bill he does not mean to pay.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly on Saturday morning the 20th of June, shrill-sounding\r\n      heralds proclaim through the streets of Versailles, that there is\r\n      to be a _Séance Royale_ next Monday; and no meeting of the\r\n      States-General till then. And yet, we observe, President Bailly\r\n      in sound of this, and with De Brézé’s Letter in his pocket, is\r\n      proceeding, with National Assembly at his heels, to the\r\n      accustomed Salles des Menus; as if De Brézé and heralds were mere\r\n      wind. It is shut, this Salle; occupied by Gardes Françaises.\r\n      ‘Where is your Captain?’ The Captain shows his royal order:\r\n      workmen, he is grieved to say, are all busy setting up the\r\n      platform for his Majesty’s _Séance;_ most unfortunately, no\r\n      admission; admission, at furthest, for President and Secretaries\r\n      to bring away papers, which the joiners might destroy!—President\r\n      Bailly enters with Secretaries; and returns bearing papers: alas,\r\n      within doors, instead of patriotic eloquence, there is now no\r\n      noise but hammering, sawing, and operative screeching and\r\n      rumbling! A profanation without parallel.\r\n\r\n      The Deputies stand grouped on the Paris Road, on this umbrageous\r\n      _Avenue de Versailles;_ complaining aloud of the indignity done\r\n      them. Courtiers, it is supposed, look from their windows, and\r\n      giggle. The morning is none of the comfortablest: raw; it is even\r\n      drizzling a little.[149] But all travellers pause; patriot\r\n      gallery-men, miscellaneous spectators increase the groups. Wild\r\n      counsels alternate. Some desperate Deputies propose to go and\r\n      hold session on the great outer Staircase at Marly, under the\r\n      King’s windows; for his Majesty, it seems, has driven over\r\n      thither. Others talk of making the Château Forecourt, what they\r\n      call _Place d’Armes_, a Runnymede and new _Champ de Mai_ of free\r\n      Frenchmen: nay of awakening, to sounds of indignant Patriotism,\r\n      the echoes of the Œil-de-boeuf itself.—Notice is given that\r\n      President Bailly, aided by judicious Guillotin and others, has\r\n      found place in the Tennis-Court of the Rue St. François. Thither,\r\n      in long-drawn files, hoarse-jingling, like cranes on wing, the\r\n      Commons Deputies angrily wend.\r\n\r\n      Strange sight was this in the Rue St. François, Vieux Versailles!\r\n      A naked Tennis-Court, as the pictures of that time still give it:\r\n      four walls; naked, except aloft some poor wooden penthouse, or\r\n      roofed spectators’-gallery, hanging round them:—on the floor not\r\n      now an idle teeheeing, a snapping of balls and rackets; but the\r\n      bellowing din of an indignant National Representation,\r\n      scandalously exiled hither! However, a cloud of witnesses looks\r\n      down on them, from wooden penthouse, from wall-top, from\r\n      adjoining roof and chimney; rolls towards them from all quarters,\r\n      with passionate spoken blessings. Some table can be procured to\r\n      write on; some chair, if not to sit on, then to stand on. The\r\n      Secretaries undo their tapes; Bailly has constituted the\r\n      Assembly.\r\n\r\n      Experienced Mounier, not wholly new to such things, in\r\n      Parlementary revolts, which he has seen or heard of, thinks that\r\n      it were well, in these lamentable threatening circumstances, to\r\n      unite themselves by an Oath.—Universal acclamation, as from\r\n      smouldering bosoms getting vent! The Oath is redacted; pronounced\r\n      aloud by President Bailly,—and indeed in such a sonorous tone,\r\n      that the cloud of witnesses, even outdoors, hear it, and bellow\r\n      response to it. Six hundred right-hands rise with President\r\n      Bailly’s, to take God above to witness that they will not\r\n      separate for man below, but will meet in all places, under all\r\n      circumstances, wheresoever two or three can get together, till\r\n      they have made the Constitution. Made the Constitution, Friends!\r\n      That is a long task. Six hundred hands, meanwhile, will sign as\r\n      they have sworn: six hundred save one; one Loyalist Abdiel, still\r\n      visible by this sole light-point, and nameable, poor “M. Martin\r\n      d’Auch, from Castelnaudary, in Languedoc.” Him they permit to\r\n      sign or signify refusal; they even save him from the cloud of\r\n      witnesses, by declaring “his head deranged.” At four o’clock, the\r\n      signatures are all appended; new meeting is fixed for Monday\r\n      morning, earlier than the hour of the Royal Session; that our\r\n      Hundred and Forty-nine Clerical deserters be not balked: we shall\r\n      meet “at the Recollets Church or elsewhere,” in hope that our\r\n      Hundred and Forty-nine will join us;—and now it is time to go to\r\n      dinner.\r\n\r\n      This, then, is the Session of the Tennis-Court, famed _Séance du\r\n      Jeu de Paume;_ the fame of which has gone forth to all lands.\r\n      This is Mercurius de Brézé’s appearance as _Deus ex machinâ;_\r\n      this is the fruit it brings! The giggle of Courtiers in the\r\n      Versailles Avenue has already died into gaunt silence. Did the\r\n      distracted Court, with Gardes-des-Sceaux Barentin, Triumvirate\r\n      and Company, imagine that they could scatter six hundred National\r\n      Deputies, big with a National Constitution, like as much barndoor\r\n      poultry, big with next to nothing,—by the white or black rod of a\r\n      Supreme Usher? Barndoor poultry fly cackling: but National\r\n      Deputies turn round, lion-faced; and, with uplifted right-hand,\r\n      swear an Oath that makes the four corners of France tremble.\r\n\r\n      President Bailly has covered himself with honour; which shall\r\n      become rewards. The National Assembly is now doubly and trebly\r\n      the Nation’s Assembly; not militant, martyred only, but\r\n      triumphant; insulted, and which could not _be_ insulted. Paris\r\n      disembogues itself once more, to witness, “with grim looks,” the\r\n      _Séance Royale:_[150] which, by a new felicity, is postponed till\r\n      Tuesday. The Hundred and Forty-nine, and even with Bishops among\r\n      them, all in processional mass, have had free leisure to march\r\n      off, and solemnly join the Commons sitting waiting in their\r\n      Church. The Commons welcomed them with shouts, with embracings,\r\n      nay with tears;[151] for it is growing a life-and-death matter\r\n      now.\r\n\r\n      As for the _Séance_ itself, the Carpenters seem to have\r\n      accomplished their platform; but all else remains unaccomplished.\r\n      Futile, we may say fatal, was the whole matter. King Louis\r\n      enters, through seas of people, all grim-silent, angry with many\r\n      things,—for it is a bitter rain too. Enters, to a Third Estate,\r\n      likewise grim-silent; which has been wetted waiting under mean\r\n      porches, at back-doors, while Court and Privileged were entering\r\n      by the front. King and Garde-des-Sceaux (there is no Necker\r\n      visible) make known, not without longwindedness, the\r\n      determinations of the royal breast. The Three Orders _shall_ vote\r\n      separately. On the other hand, France may look for considerable\r\n      constitutional blessings; as specified in these Five-and-thirty\r\n      Articles,[152] which Garde-des-Sceaux is waxing hoarse with\r\n      reading. Which Five-and-Thirty Articles, adds his Majesty again\r\n      rising, if the Three Orders most unfortunately cannot agree\r\n      together to effect them, I myself will effect: ‘_seul je ferai le\r\n      bien de mes peuples_,’—which being interpreted may signify, You,\r\n      contentious Deputies of the States-General, have probably not\r\n      long to be here! But, in fine, all shall now withdraw for this\r\n      day; and meet again, each Order in its separate place, tomorrow\r\n      morning, for despatch of business. _This_ is the determination of\r\n      the royal breast: pithy and clear. And herewith King, retinue,\r\n      Noblesse, majority of Clergy file out, as if the whole matter\r\n      were satisfactorily completed.\r\n\r\n      These file out; through grim-silent seas of people. Only the\r\n      Commons Deputies file not out; but stand there in gloomy silence,\r\n      uncertain what they shall do. One man of them is certain; one man\r\n      of them discerns and dares! It is now that King Mirabeau starts\r\n      to the Tribune, and lifts up his lion-voice. Verily a word in\r\n      season; for, in such scenes, the moment is the mother of ages!\r\n      Had not Gabriel Honoré been there,—one can well fancy, how the\r\n      Commons Deputies, affrighted at the perils which now yawned dim\r\n      all round them, and waxing ever paler in each other’s paleness,\r\n      might very naturally, one after one, have _glided off;_ and the\r\n      whole course of European History have been different!\r\n\r\n      But he is there. List to the _brool_ of that royal forest-voice;\r\n      sorrowful, low; fast swelling to a roar! Eyes kindle at the\r\n      glance of his eye:—National Deputies were missioned by a Nation;\r\n      they have sworn an Oath; they—but lo! while the lion’s voice\r\n      roars loudest, what Apparition is this? Apparition of Mercurius\r\n      de Brézé, muttering somewhat!—‘Speak out,’ cry\r\n      several.—‘Messieurs,’ shrills De Brézé, repeating himself, ‘You\r\n      have heard the King’s orders!’—Mirabeau glares on him with\r\n      fire-flashing face; shakes the black lion’s mane: ‘Yes, Monsieur,\r\n      we have heard what the King was advised to say: and you who\r\n      cannot be the interpreter of his orders to the States-General;\r\n      you, who have neither place nor right of speech here; _you_ are\r\n      not the man to remind us of it. Go, Monsieur, tell these who sent\r\n      you that we are here by the will of the People, and that nothing\r\n      shall send us hence but the force of bayonets!’[153] And poor De\r\n      Brézé shivers forth from the National Assembly;—and also (if it\r\n      be not in one faintest glimmer, months later) finally from the\r\n      page of History!—\r\n\r\n      Hapless De Brézé; doomed to survive long ages, in men’s memory,\r\n      in this faint way, with tremulent white rod! He was true to\r\n      Etiquette, which was his Faith here below; a martyr to respect of\r\n      persons. Short woollen cloaks could not kiss Majesty’s hand as\r\n      long velvet ones did. Nay lately, when the poor little Dauphin\r\n      lay dead, and some ceremonial Visitation came, was he not\r\n      punctual to announce it even to the Dauphin’s _dead body:_\r\n      ‘Monseigneur, a Deputation of the States-General!’[154] _Sunt\r\n      lachrymæ rerum._\r\n\r\n      But what does the Œil-de-Bœuf, now when De Brézé shivers back\r\n      thither? _Despatch_ that same force of bayonets? Not so: the seas\r\n      of people still hang multitudinous, intent on what is passing;\r\n      nay rush and roll, loud-billowing, into the Courts of the Château\r\n      itself; for a report has risen that Necker is to be dismissed.\r\n      Worst of all, the Gardes Françaises seem indisposed to act: “two\r\n      Companies of them _do not fire_ when ordered!”[155] Necker, for\r\n      not being at the _Séance_, shall be shouted for, carried home in\r\n      triumph; and must not be dismissed. His Grace of Paris, on the\r\n      other hand, has to fly with broken coach-panels, and owe his life\r\n      to furious driving. The _Gardes-du-Corps_ (Body-Guards), which\r\n      you were drawing out, had better be drawn in again.[156] There is\r\n      no sending of bayonets to be thought of.\r\n\r\n      Instead of soldiers, the Œil-de-Bœuf sends—carpenters, to take\r\n      down the platform. Ineffectual shift! In few instants, the very\r\n      carpenters cease wrenching and knocking at their platform; stand\r\n      on it, hammer in hand, and listen open-mouthed.[157] The Third\r\n      Estate is decreeing that it is, was, and will be, nothing but a\r\n      National Assembly; and now, moreover, an inviolable one, all\r\n      members of it inviolable: “infamous, traitorous, towards the\r\n      Nation, and guilty of capital crime, is any person,\r\n      body-corporate, tribunal, court or commission that now or\r\n      henceforth, during the present session or after it, shall dare to\r\n      pursue, interrogate, arrest, or cause to be arrested, detain or\r\n      cause to be detained, any,” &c. &c. “_on whose part soever_ the\r\n      same be commanded.”[158] Which done, one can wind up with this\r\n      comfortable reflection from Abbé Sieyes: ‘Messieurs, you are\r\n      today what you were yesterday.’\r\n\r\n      Courtiers may shriek; but it is, and remains, even so. Their\r\n      well-charged explosion has exploded _through the touch-hole;_\r\n      covering themselves with scorches, confusion, and unseemly soot!\r\n      Poor Triumvirate, poor Queen; and above all, poor Queen’s\r\n      Husband, who means well, had he any fixed meaning! Folly is that\r\n      wisdom which is wise only behindhand. Few months ago these\r\n      Thirty-five Concessions had filled France with a rejoicing, which\r\n      might have lasted for several years. Now it is unavailing, the\r\n      very mention of it slighted; Majesty’s express orders set at\r\n      nought.\r\n\r\n      All France is in a roar; a sea of persons, estimated at “ten\r\n      thousand,” whirls “all this day in the Palais Royal.”[159] The\r\n      remaining Clergy, and likewise some Forty-eight Noblesse,\r\n      D’Orléans among them, have now forthwith gone over to the\r\n      victorious Commons; by whom, as is natural, they are received\r\n      “with acclamation.”\r\n\r\n      The Third Estate triumphs; Versailles Town shouting round it; ten\r\n      thousand whirling all day in the Palais Royal; and all France\r\n      standing a-tiptoe, not unlike whirling! Let the Œil-de-Bœuf look\r\n      to it. As for King Louis, he will swallow his injuries; will\r\n      temporise, keep silence; will at all costs have present peace. It\r\n      was Tuesday the 23d of June, when he spoke that peremptory royal\r\n      mandate; and the week is not done till he has written to the\r\n      remaining obstinate Noblesse, that they also must oblige him, and\r\n      give in. D’Espréménil rages his last; Barrel Mirabeau “breaks his\r\n      sword,” making a vow,—which he might as well have kept. The\r\n      “Triple Family” is now therefore complete; the third erring\r\n      brother, the Noblesse, having joined it;—erring but pardonable;\r\n      soothed, so far as possible, by sweet eloquence from President\r\n      Bailly.\r\n\r\n      So triumphs the Third Estate; and States-General are become\r\n      National Assembly; and all France may sing _Te Deum_. By wise\r\n      inertia, and wise cessation of inertia, great victory has been\r\n      gained. It is the last night of June: all night you meet nothing\r\n      on the streets of Versailles but “men running with torches” with\r\n      shouts of jubilation. From the 2nd of May when they kissed the\r\n      hand of Majesty, to this 30th of June when men run with torches,\r\n      we count seven weeks complete. For seven weeks the National\r\n      Carroccio has stood far-seen, ringing many a signal; and, so much\r\n      having now gathered round it, may hope to stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.III.\r\n      Broglie the War-God.\r\n\r\n      The Court feels indignant that it is conquered; but what then?\r\n      Another time it will do better. Mercury descended in vain; now\r\n      has the time come for Mars.—The gods of the Œil-de-Bœuf have\r\n      withdrawn into the darkness of their cloudy Ida; and sit there,\r\n      shaping and forging what may be needful, be it “billets of a new\r\n      National Bank,” munitions of war, or things forever inscrutable\r\n      to men.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, what means this “apparatus of troops”? The National\r\n      Assembly can get no furtherance for its Committee of\r\n      Subsistences; can hear only that, at Paris, the Bakers’ shops are\r\n      besieged; that, in the Provinces, people are living on\r\n      “meal-husks and boiled grass.” But on all highways there hover\r\n      dust-clouds, with the march of regiments, with the trailing of\r\n      cannon: foreign Pandours, of fierce aspect; Salis-Samade,\r\n      Esterhazy, Royal-Allemand; so many of them foreign, to the number\r\n      of thirty thousand,—which fear can magnify to fifty: all wending\r\n      towards Paris and Versailles! Already, on the heights of\r\n      Montmartre, is a digging and delving; too like a scarping and\r\n      trenching. The effluence of Paris is arrested Versailles-ward by\r\n      a barrier of cannon at Sèvres Bridge. From the Queen’s Mews,\r\n      cannon stand pointed on the National Assembly Hall itself. The\r\n      National Assembly has its very slumbers broken by the tramp of\r\n      soldiery, swarming and defiling, endless, or seemingly endless,\r\n      all round those spaces, at dead of night, “without drum-music,\r\n      without audible word of command.”[160] What means it?\r\n\r\n      Shall eight, or even shall twelve Deputies, our Mirabeaus,\r\n      Barnaves at the head of them, be whirled suddenly to the Castle\r\n      of Ham; the rest ignominiously dispersed to the winds? No\r\n      National Assembly can make the Constitution with cannon levelled\r\n      on it from the Queen’s Mews! What means this reticence of the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf, broken only by nods and shrugs? In the mystery of\r\n      that cloudy Ida, what is it that they forge and shape?—Such\r\n      questions must distracted Patriotism keep asking, and receive no\r\n      answer but an echo.\r\n\r\n      Enough of themselves! But now, above all, while the hungry\r\n      food-year, which runs from August to August, is getting older;\r\n      becoming more and more a famine-year? With “meal-husks and boiled\r\n      grass,” Brigands may actually collect; and, in crowds, at farm\r\n      and mansion, howl angrily, _Food! Food!_ It is in vain to send\r\n      soldiers against them: at sight of soldiers they disperse, they\r\n      vanish as under ground; then directly reassemble elsewhere for\r\n      new tumult and plunder. Frightful enough to look upon; but what\r\n      to _hear_ of, reverberated through Twenty-five Millions of\r\n      suspicious minds! Brigands and Broglie, open Conflagration,\r\n      preternatural Rumour are driving mad most hearts in France. What\r\n      will the issue of these things be?\r\n\r\n      At Marseilles, many weeks ago, the Townsmen have taken arms; for\r\n      “suppressing of Brigands,” and other purposes: the military\r\n      commandant may make of it what he will. Elsewhere, everywhere,\r\n      could not the like be done? Dubious, on the distracted Patriot\r\n      imagination, wavers, as a last deliverance, some foreshadow of a\r\n      _National Guard_. But conceive, above all, the Wooden Tent in the\r\n      Palais Royal! A universal hubbub there, as of dissolving worlds:\r\n      their loudest bellows the mad, mad-making voice of Rumour; their\r\n      sharpest gazes Suspicion into the pale dim World-Whirlpool;\r\n      discerning shapes and phantasms; imminent bloodthirsty Regiments\r\n      camped on the Champ-de-Mars; dispersed National Assembly; redhot\r\n      cannon-balls (to burn Paris);—the mad War-god and Bellona’s\r\n      sounding thongs. To the calmest man it is becoming too plain that\r\n      battle is inevitable.\r\n\r\n      Inevitable, silently nod Messeigneurs and Broglie: Inevitable and\r\n      brief! Your National Assembly, stopped short in its\r\n      Constitutional labours, may fatigue the royal ear with addresses\r\n      and remonstrances: those cannon of ours stand duly levelled;\r\n      those troops are here. The King’s Declaration, with its\r\n      Thirty-five too generous Articles, was spoken, was not listened\r\n      to; but remains yet unrevoked: he himself shall effect it, _seul\r\n      il fera!_\r\n\r\n      As for Broglie, he has his headquarters at Versailles, all as in\r\n      a seat of war: clerks writing; significant staff-officers,\r\n      inclined to taciturnity; plumed aides-de-camp, scouts, orderlies\r\n      flying or hovering. He himself looks forth, important,\r\n      impenetrable; listens to Besenval Commandant of Paris, and his\r\n      warning and earnest counsels (for he has come out repeatedly on\r\n      purpose), with a silent smile.[161] The Parisians resist?\r\n      scornfully cry Messeigneurs. As a meal-mob may! They have sat\r\n      quiet, these five generations, submitting to all. Their Mercier\r\n      declared, in these very years, that a Parisian revolt was\r\n      henceforth “impossible.”[162] Stand by the royal Declaration, of\r\n      the Twenty-third of June. The Nobles of France, valorous,\r\n      chivalrous as of old, will rally round us with one heart;—and as\r\n      for this which you call Third Estate, and which we call\r\n      _canaille_ of unwashed Sansculottes, of Patelins, Scribblers,\r\n      factious Spouters,—brave Broglie, “with a whiff of grapeshot\r\n      (_salve de canons_),” if need be, will give quick account of it.\r\n      Thus reason they: on their cloudy Ida; hidden from men,—men also\r\n      hidden from them.\r\n\r\n      Good is grapeshot, Messeigneurs, on one condition: that the\r\n      shooter also were made of metal! But unfortunately he is made of\r\n      flesh; under his buffs and bandoleers your hired shooter has\r\n      instincts, feelings, even a kind of thought. It is his kindred,\r\n      bone of his bone, this same _canaille_ that shall be whiffed; he\r\n      has brothers in it, a father and mother,—living on meal-husks and\r\n      boiled grass. His very doxy, not yet “dead i’ the spital,” drives\r\n      him into military heterodoxy; declares that if he shed Patriot\r\n      blood, he shall be accursed among men. The soldier, who has seen\r\n      his pay stolen by rapacious Foulons, his blood wasted by\r\n      Soubises, Pompadours, and the gates of promotion shut inexorably\r\n      on him if he were not born noble,—is himself not without griefs\r\n      against you. Your cause is not the soldier’s cause; but, as would\r\n      seem, your own only, and no other god’s nor man’s.\r\n\r\n      For example, the world may have heard how, at Bethune lately,\r\n      when there rose some “riot about grains,” of which sort there are\r\n      so many, and the soldiers stood drawn out, and the word “Fire!\r\n      was given,—not a trigger stirred; only the butts of all muskets\r\n      rattled angrily against the ground; and the soldiers stood\r\n      glooming, with a mixed expression of countenance;—till clutched\r\n      “each under the arm of a patriot householder,” they were all\r\n      hurried off, in this manner, to be treated and caressed, and have\r\n      their pay increased by subscription![163]\r\n\r\n      Neither have the Gardes Françaises, the best regiment of the\r\n      line, shown any promptitude for street-firing lately. They\r\n      returned grumbling from Réveillon’s; and have not burnt a single\r\n      cartridge since; nay, as we saw, not even when bid. A dangerous\r\n      humour dwells in these Gardes. Notable men too, in their way!\r\n      Valadi the Pythagorean was, at one time, an officer of theirs.\r\n      Nay, in the ranks, under the three-cornered felt and cockade,\r\n      what hard heads may there not be, and reflections going\r\n      on,—unknown to the public! One head of the hardest we do now\r\n      discern there: on the shoulders of a certain Sergeant Hoche.\r\n      Lazare Hoche, that is the name of him; he used to be about the\r\n      Versailles Royal Stables, nephew of a poor herbwoman; a handy\r\n      lad; exceedingly addicted to reading. He is now Sergeant Hoche,\r\n      and can rise no farther: he lays out his pay in rushlights, and\r\n      cheap editions of books.[164]\r\n\r\n      On the whole, the best seems to be: Consign these Gardes\r\n      Françaises to their Barracks. So Besenval thinks, and orders.\r\n      Consigned to their barracks, the Gardes Françaises do but form a\r\n      “Secret Association,” an Engagement not to act against the\r\n      National Assembly. Debauched by Valadi the Pythagorean; debauched\r\n      by money and women! cry Besenval and innumerable others.\r\n      Debauched by what you will, or in need of no debauching, behold\r\n      them, long files of them, their consignment broken, arrive,\r\n      headed by their Sergeants, on the 26th day of June, at the Palais\r\n      Royal! Welcomed with vivats, with presents, and a pledge of\r\n      patriot liquor; embracing and embraced; declaring in words that\r\n      the cause of France is their cause! Next day and the following\r\n      days the like. What is singular too, except this patriot humour,\r\n      and breaking of their consignment, they behave otherwise with\r\n      “the most rigorous accuracy.”[165]\r\n\r\n      They are growing questionable, these Gardes! Eleven ring-leaders\r\n      of them are put in the Abbaye Prison. It boots not in the least.\r\n      The imprisoned Eleven have only, “by the hand of an individual,”\r\n      to drop, towards nightfall, a line in the Café de Foy; where\r\n      Patriotism harangues loudest on its table. “Two hundred young\r\n      persons, soon waxing to four thousand,” with fit crowbars, roll\r\n      towards the Abbaye; smite asunder the needful doors; and bear out\r\n      their Eleven, with other military victims:—to supper in the\r\n      Palais Royal Garden; to board, and lodging “in campbeds, in the\r\n      _Théâtre des Variétés;_” other national _Prytaneum_ as yet not\r\n      being in readiness. Most deliberate! Nay so punctual were these\r\n      young persons, that finding one military victim to have been\r\n      imprisoned for real civil crime, they returned him to his cell,\r\n      with protest.\r\n\r\n      Why new military force was not called out? New military force was\r\n      called out. New military force did arrive, full gallop, with\r\n      drawn sabre: but the people gently “laid hold of their bridles;”\r\n      the dragoons sheathed their swords; lifted their caps by way of\r\n      salute, and sat like mere statues of dragoons,—except indeed that\r\n      a drop of liquor being brought them, they “drank to the King and\r\n      Nation with the greatest cordiality.”[166]\r\n\r\n      And now, ask in return, why Messeigneurs and Broglie the great\r\n      god of war, on seeing these things, did not pause, and take some\r\n      other course, any other course? Unhappily, as we said, they could\r\n      see nothing. Pride, which goes before a fall; wrath, if not\r\n      reasonable, yet pardonable, most natural, had hardened their\r\n      hearts and heated their heads; so, with imbecility and violence\r\n      (ill-matched pair), they rush to seek their hour. All Regiments\r\n      are not Gardes Françaises, or debauched by Valadi the\r\n      Pythagorean: let fresh undebauched Regiments come up; let\r\n      Royal-Allemand, Salais-Samade, Swiss Château-Vieux come up,—which\r\n      can fight, but can hardly speak except in German gutturals; let\r\n      soldiers march, and highways thunder with artillery-waggons:\r\n      Majesty has a new Royal Session to hold,—and miracles to work\r\n      there! The whiff of grapeshot can, if needful, become a blast and\r\n      tempest.\r\n\r\n      In which circumstances, before the redhot balls begin raining,\r\n      may not the Hundred-and-twenty Paris Electors, though their\r\n      _Cahier_ is long since finished, see good to meet again daily, as\r\n      an “Electoral Club”? They meet first “in a Tavern;”—where “the\r\n      largest wedding-party” cheerfully give place to them.[167] But\r\n      latterly they meet in the _Hôtel-de-Ville_, in the Townhall\r\n      itself. Flesselles, Provost of Merchants, with his Four Echevins\r\n      (_Scabins_, Assessors), could not prevent it; such was the force\r\n      of public opinion. He, with his Echevins, and the Six-and-Twenty\r\n      Town-Councillors, all appointed from Above, may well sit silent\r\n      there, in their long gowns; and consider, with awed eye, what\r\n      prelude this is of convulsion coming from Below, and how\r\n      themselves shall fare in that!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.IV.\r\n      To Arms!\r\n\r\n      So hangs it, dubious, fateful, in the sultry days of July. It is\r\n      the passionate printed _advice_ of M. Marat, to abstain, of all\r\n      things, from violence.[168] Nevertheless the hungry poor are\r\n      already burning Town Barriers, where Tribute on eatables is\r\n      levied; getting clamorous for food.\r\n\r\n      The twelfth July morning is Sunday; the streets are all placarded\r\n      with an enormous-sized _De par le Roi_, “inviting peaceable\r\n      citizens to remain within doors,” to feel no alarm, to gather in\r\n      no crowd. Why so? What mean these “placards of enormous size”?\r\n      Above all, what means this clatter of military; dragoons,\r\n      hussars, rattling in from all points of the compass towards the\r\n      Place Louis Quinze; with a staid gravity of face, though saluted\r\n      with mere nicknames, hootings and even missiles?[169] Besenval is\r\n      with them. Swiss Guards of his are already in the Champs Elysées,\r\n      with four pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\n      Have the destroyers descended on us, then? From the Bridge of\r\n      Sèvres to utmost Vincennes, from Saint-Denis to the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars, we are begirt! Alarm, of the vague unknown, is in\r\n      every heart. The Palais Royal has become a place of awestruck\r\n      interjections, silent shakings of the head: one can fancy with\r\n      what dolorous sound the noon-tide cannon (which the Sun fires at\r\n      the crossing of his meridian) went off there; bodeful, like an\r\n      inarticulate voice of doom.[170] Are these troops verily come out\r\n      “against Brigands”? Where are the Brigands? What mystery is in\r\n      the wind?—Hark! a human voice reporting articulately the\r\n      Job’s-news: _Necker, People’s Minister, Saviour of France, is\r\n      dismissed_. Impossible; incredible! Treasonous to the public\r\n      peace! Such a voice ought to be choked in the\r\n      water-works;[171]—had not the news-bringer quickly fled.\r\n      Nevertheless, friends, make of it what you will, the news is\r\n      true. Necker is gone. Necker hies northward incessantly, in\r\n      obedient secrecy, since yesternight. We have a new Ministry:\r\n      Broglie the War-god; Aristocrat Bréteuil; Foulon who said the\r\n      people might eat grass!\r\n\r\n      Rumour, therefore, shall arise; in the Palais Royal, and in broad\r\n      France. Paleness sits on every face; confused tremor and\r\n      fremescence; waxing into thunder-peals, of Fury stirred on by\r\n      Fear.\r\n\r\n      But see Camille Desmoulins, from the Café de Foy, rushing out,\r\n      sibylline in face; his hair streaming, in each hand a pistol! He\r\n      springs to a table: the Police satellites are eyeing him; alive\r\n      they shall not take him, not they alive him alive. This time he\r\n      speaks without stammering:—Friends, shall we die like hunted\r\n      hares? Like sheep hounded into their pinfold; bleating for mercy,\r\n      where is no mercy, but only a whetted knife? The hour is come;\r\n      the supreme hour of Frenchman and Man; when Oppressors are to try\r\n      conclusions with Oppressed; and the word is, swift Death, or\r\n      Deliverance forever. Let such hour be _well_-come! Us, meseems,\r\n      one cry only befits: To Arms! Let universal Paris, universal\r\n      France, as with the throat of the whirlwind, sound only: To\r\n      arms!—‘To arms!’ yell responsive the innumerable voices: like one\r\n      great voice, as of a Demon yelling from the air: for all faces\r\n      wax fire-eyed, all hearts burn up into madness. In such, or\r\n      fitter words,[172] does Camille evoke the Elemental Powers, in\r\n      this great moment.—Friends, continues Camille, some rallying\r\n      sign! Cockades; green ones;—the colour of hope!—As with the\r\n      flight of locusts, these green tree leaves; green ribands from\r\n      the neighbouring shops; all green things are snatched, and made\r\n      cockades of. Camille descends from his table, “stifled with\r\n      embraces, wetted with tears;” has a bit of green riband handed\r\n      him; sticks it in his hat. And now to Curtius’ Image-shop there;\r\n      to the Boulevards; to the four winds; and rest not till France be\r\n      on fire!\r\n\r\n      France, so long shaken and wind-parched, is probably at the right\r\n      inflammable point.—As for poor Curtius, who, one grieves to\r\n      think, might be but imperfectly paid,—he cannot make two words\r\n      about his Images. The Wax-bust of Necker, the Wax-bust of\r\n      D’Orléans, helpers of France: these, covered with crape, as in\r\n      funeral procession, or after the manner of suppliants appealing\r\n      to Heaven, to Earth, and Tartarus itself, a mixed multitude bears\r\n      off. For a sign! As indeed man, with his singular imaginative\r\n      faculties, can do little or nothing without signs: thus Turks\r\n      look to their Prophet’s banner; also Osier _Mannikins_ have been\r\n      burnt, and Necker’s Portrait has erewhile figured, aloft on its\r\n      perch.\r\n\r\n      In this manner march they, a mixed, continually increasing\r\n      multitude; armed with axes, staves and miscellanea; grim,\r\n      many-sounding, through the streets. Be all Theatres shut; let all\r\n      dancing, on planked floor, or on the natural greensward, cease!\r\n      Instead of a Christian Sabbath, and feast of _guinguette_\r\n      tabernacles, it shall be a Sorcerer’s Sabbath; and Paris, gone\r\n      rabid, dance,—with the Fiend for piper!\r\n\r\n      However, Besenval, with horse and foot, is in the Place Louis\r\n      Quinze. Mortals promenading homewards, in the fall of the day,\r\n      saunter by, from Chaillot or Passy, from flirtation and a little\r\n      thin wine; with sadder step than usual. Will the Bust-Procession\r\n      pass that way! Behold it; behold also Prince Lambesc dash forth\r\n      on it, with his Royal-Allemands! Shots fall, and sabre-strokes;\r\n      Busts are hewn asunder; and, alas, also heads of men. A sabred\r\n      Procession has nothing for it but to _explode_, along what\r\n      streets, alleys, Tuileries Avenues it finds; and disappear. One\r\n      unarmed man lies hewed down; a Garde Française by his uniform:\r\n      bear him (or bear even the report of him) dead and gory to his\r\n      Barracks;—where he has comrades still alive!\r\n\r\n      But why not now, victorious Lambesc, charge through that\r\n      Tuileries Garden itself, where the fugitives are vanishing? Not\r\n      show the Sunday promenaders too, how steel glitters, besprent\r\n      with blood; that it be told of, and men’s ears tingle?—Tingle,\r\n      alas, they did; but the wrong way. Victorious Lambesc, in this\r\n      his second or Tuileries charge, succeeds but in overturning (call\r\n      it not slashing, for he struck with the flat of his sword) one\r\n      man, a poor old schoolmaster, most pacifically tottering there;\r\n      and is driven out, by barricade of chairs, by flights of “bottles\r\n      and glasses,” by execrations in bass voice and treble. Most\r\n      delicate is the mob-queller’s vocation; wherein Too-much may be\r\n      as bad as Not-enough. For each of these bass voices, and more\r\n      each treble voice, borne to all points of the City, rings now\r\n      nothing but distracted indignation; will ring all another. The\r\n      cry, _To arms!_ roars tenfold; steeples with their metal\r\n      storm-voice boom out, as the sun sinks; armorer’s shops are\r\n      broken open, plundered; the streets are a living foam-sea, chafed\r\n      by all the winds.\r\n\r\n      Such issue came of Lambesc’s charge on the Tuileries Garden: no\r\n      striking of salutary terror into Chaillot promenaders; a striking\r\n      into broad wakefulness of Frenzy and the three Furies,—which\r\n      otherwise were not asleep! For they lie always, those\r\n      subterranean Eumenides (fabulous and yet so true), in the dullest\r\n      existence of man;—and can dance, brandishing their dusky torches,\r\n      shaking their serpent-hair. Lambesc with Royal-Allemand may ride\r\n      to his barracks, with curses for his marching-music; then ride\r\n      back again, like one troubled in mind: vengeful Gardes\r\n      Françaises, _sacre_ing, with knit brows, start out on him, from\r\n      their barracks in the Chaussé d’Antin; pour a volley into him\r\n      (killing and wounding); which he must not answer, but ride\r\n      on.[173]\r\n\r\n      Counsel dwells not under the plumed hat. If the Eumenides awaken,\r\n      and Broglie has given no orders, what can a Besenval do? When the\r\n      Gardes Françaises, with Palais-Royal volunteers, roll down,\r\n      greedy of more vengeance, to the Place Louis Quinze itself, they\r\n      find neither Besenval, Lambesc, Royal-Allemand, nor any soldier\r\n      now there. Gone is military order. On the far Eastern Boulevard,\r\n      of Saint-Antoine, the Chasseurs Normandie arrive, dusty, thirsty,\r\n      after a hard day’s ride; but can find no billet-master, see no\r\n      course in this City of confusions; cannot get to Besenval, cannot\r\n      so much as discover where he is: Normandie must even bivouac\r\n      there, in its dust and thirst,—unless some patriot will treat it\r\n      to a cup of liquor, with advices.\r\n\r\n      Raging multitudes surround the Hôtel-de-Ville, crying: Arms!\r\n      Orders! The Six-and-twenty Town-Councillors, with their long\r\n      gowns, have ducked under (into the raging chaos);—shall never\r\n      emerge more. Besenval is painfully wriggling himself out, to the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars; he must sit there “in the cruelest uncertainty:”\r\n      courier after courier may dash off for Versailles; but will bring\r\n      back no answer, can hardly bring himself back. For the roads are\r\n      all blocked with batteries and pickets, with floods of carriages\r\n      arrested for examination: such was Broglie’s one sole order; the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf, hearing in the distance such mad din, which sounded\r\n      almost like invasion, will before all things keep its own head\r\n      whole. A new Ministry, with, as it were, but one foot in the\r\n      stirrup, cannot take leaps. Mad Paris is abandoned altogether to\r\n      itself.\r\n\r\n      What a Paris, when the darkness fell! A European metropolitan\r\n      City hurled suddenly forth from its old combinations and\r\n      arrangements; to crash tumultuously together, seeking new. Use\r\n      and wont will now no longer direct any man; each man, with what\r\n      of originality he has, must begin thinking; or following those\r\n      that think. Seven hundred thousand individuals, on the sudden,\r\n      find all their old paths, old ways of acting and deciding, vanish\r\n      from under their feet. And so there go they, with clangour and\r\n      terror, they know not as yet whether running, swimming or\r\n      flying,—headlong into the New Era. With clangour and terror: from\r\n      above, Broglie the war-god impends, preternatural, with his\r\n      redhot cannon-balls; and from below, a preternatural\r\n      Brigand-world menaces with dirk and firebrand: madness rules the\r\n      hour.\r\n\r\n      Happily, in place of the submerged Twenty-six, the Electoral Club\r\n      is gathering; has declared itself a “Provisional Municipality.”\r\n      On the morrow it will get Provost Flesselles, with an Echevin or\r\n      two, to give help in many things. For the present it decrees one\r\n      most essential thing: that forthwith a “Parisian Militia” shall\r\n      be enrolled. Depart, ye heads of Districts, to labour in this\r\n      great work; while we here, in Permanent Committee, sit alert. Let\r\n      fencible men, each party in its own range of streets, keep watch\r\n      and ward, all night. Let Paris court a little fever-sleep;\r\n      confused by such fever-dreams, of “violent motions at the Palais\r\n      Royal;”—or from time to time start awake, and look out,\r\n      palpitating, in its nightcap, at the clash of discordant\r\n      mutually-unintelligible Patrols; on the gleam of distant\r\n      Barriers, going up all-too ruddy towards the vault of Night.[174]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.V.\r\n      Give us Arms.\r\n\r\n      On Monday the huge City has awoke, not to its week-day industry:\r\n      to what a different one! The working man has become a fighting\r\n      man; has one want only: that of arms. The industry of all crafts\r\n      has paused;—except it be the smith’s, fiercely hammering pikes;\r\n      and, in a faint degree, the kitchener’s, cooking off-hand\r\n      victuals; for _bouche va toujours_. Women too are sewing\r\n      cockades;—not now of green, which being D’Artois colour, the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville has had to interfere in it; but of _red_ and\r\n      _blue_, our old Paris colours: these, once based on a ground of\r\n      constitutional _white_, are the famed TRICOLOR,—which (if\r\n      Prophecy err not) “will go round the world.”\r\n\r\n      All shops, unless it be the Bakers’ and Vintners’, are shut:\r\n      Paris is in the streets;—rushing, foaming like some Venice\r\n      wine-glass into which you had dropped poison. The tocsin, by\r\n      order, is pealing madly from all steeples. Arms, ye Elector\r\n      Municipals; thou Flesselles with thy Echevins, give us arms!\r\n      Flesselles gives what he can: fallacious, perhaps insidious\r\n      promises of arms from Charleville; order to seek arms here, order\r\n      to seek them there. The new Municipals give what they can; some\r\n      three hundred and sixty indifferent firelocks, the equipment of\r\n      the City-Watch: “a man in wooden shoes, and without coat,\r\n      directly clutches one of them, and mounts guard.” Also as hinted,\r\n      an order to all Smiths to make pikes with their whole soul.\r\n\r\n      Heads of Districts are in fervent consultation; subordinate\r\n      Patriotism roams distracted, ravenous for arms. Hitherto at the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville was only such modicum of indifferent firelocks as\r\n      we have seen. At the so-called Arsenal, there lies nothing but\r\n      rust, rubbish and saltpetre,—overlooked too by the guns of the\r\n      Bastille. His Majesty’s Repository, what they call\r\n      _Garde-Meuble_, is forced and ransacked: tapestries enough, and\r\n      gauderies; but of serviceable fighting-gear small stock! Two\r\n      silver-mounted cannons there are; an ancient gift from his\r\n      Majesty of Siam to Louis Fourteenth: gilt sword of the Good\r\n      Henri; antique Chivalry arms and armour. These, and such as\r\n      these, a necessitous Patriotism snatches greedily, for want of\r\n      better. The Siamese cannons go trundling, on an errand they were\r\n      not meant for. Among the indifferent firelocks are seen\r\n      tourney-lances; the princely helm and hauberk glittering amid\r\n      ill-hatted heads,—as in a time when all times and their\r\n      possessions are suddenly sent jumbling!\r\n\r\n      At the _Maison de Saint-Lazare_, Lazar-House once, now a\r\n      Correction-House with Priests, there was no trace of arms; but,\r\n      on the other hand, corn, plainly to a culpable extent. Out with\r\n      it, to market; in this scarcity of grains!—Heavens, will\r\n      “fifty-two carts,” in long row, hardly carry it to the _Halle aux\r\n      Bleds?_ Well, truly, ye reverend Fathers, was your pantry filled;\r\n      fat are your larders; over-generous your wine-bins, ye plotting\r\n      exasperators of the Poor; traitorous forestallers of bread!\r\n\r\n      Vain is protesting, entreaty on bare knees: the House of\r\n      Saint-Lazarus has that in it which comes not out by protesting.\r\n      Behold, how, from every window, it _vomits:_ mere torrents of\r\n      furniture, of bellowing and hurlyburly;—the cellars also leaking\r\n      wine. Till, as was natural, smoke rose,—kindled, some say, by the\r\n      desperate Saint-Lazaristes themselves, desperate of other\r\n      riddance; and the Establishment vanished from this world in\r\n      flame. Remark nevertheless that “a thief” (set on or not by\r\n      Aristocrats), being detected there, is “instantly hanged.”\r\n\r\n      Look also at the Châtelet Prison. The Debtors’ Prison of La Force\r\n      is broken from without; and they that sat in bondage to\r\n      Aristocrats go free: hearing of which the Felons at the Châtelet\r\n      do likewise “dig up their pavements,” and stand on the offensive;\r\n      with the best prospects,—had not Patriotism, passing that way,\r\n      “fired a volley” into the Felon world; and crushed it down again\r\n      under hatches. Patriotism consorts not with thieving and felony:\r\n      surely also Punishment, this day, hitches (if she still hitch)\r\n      after Crime, with frightful shoes-of-swiftness! “Some score or\r\n      two” of wretched persons, found prostrate with drink in the\r\n      cellars of that Saint-Lazare, are indignantly haled to prison;\r\n      the Jailor has no room; whereupon, other place of security not\r\n      suggesting itself, it is written, “_on les pendit_, they hanged\r\n      them.”[175] Brief is the word; not without significance, be it\r\n      true or untrue!\r\n\r\n      In such circumstances, the Aristocrat, the unpatriotic rich man\r\n      is packing-up for departure. But he shall not get departed. A\r\n      wooden-shod force has seized all Barriers, burnt or not: all that\r\n      enters, all that seeks to issue, is stopped there, and dragged to\r\n      the Hôtel-de-Ville: coaches, tumbrils, plate, furniture, “many\r\n      meal-sacks,” in time even “flocks and herds” encumber the Place\r\n      de Grève.[176]\r\n\r\n      And so it roars, and rages, and brays; drums beating, steeples\r\n      pealing; criers rushing with hand-bells: ‘Oyez, oyez. All men to\r\n      their Districts to be enrolled!’ The Districts have met in\r\n      gardens, open squares; are getting marshalled into volunteer\r\n      troops. No redhot ball has yet fallen from Besenval’s Camp; on\r\n      the contrary, Deserters with their arms are continually dropping\r\n      in: nay now, joy of joys, at two in the afternoon, the Gardes\r\n      Françaises, being ordered to Saint-Denis, and flatly declining,\r\n      have come over in a body! It is a fact worth many. Three thousand\r\n      six hundred of the best fighting men, with complete accoutrement;\r\n      with cannoneers even, and cannon! Their officers are left\r\n      standing alone; could not so much as succeed in “spiking the\r\n      guns.” The very Swiss, it may now be hoped, Château-Vieux and the\r\n      others, will have doubts about fighting.\r\n\r\n      Our Parisian Militia,—which some think it were better to name\r\n      National Guard,—is prospering as heart could wish. It promised to\r\n      be forty-eight thousand; but will in few hours double and\r\n      quadruple that number: invincible, if we had only arms!\r\n\r\n      But see, the promised Charleville Boxes, marked _Artillerie!_\r\n      Here, then, are arms enough?—Conceive the blank face of\r\n      Patriotism, when it found them filled with rags, foul linen,\r\n      candle-ends, and bits of wood! Provost of the Merchants, how is\r\n      this? Neither at the Chartreux Convent, whither we were sent with\r\n      signed order, is there or ever was there any weapon of war. Nay\r\n      here, in this Seine Boat, safe under tarpaulings (had not the\r\n      nose of Patriotism been of the finest), are “five thousand-weight\r\n      of gunpowder;” not coming _in_, but surreptitiously going out!\r\n      What meanest thou, Flesselles? ’Tis a ticklish game, that of\r\n      “amusing” us. Cat plays with captive mouse: but mouse with\r\n      enraged cat, with enraged National Tiger?\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, the faster, O ye black-aproned Smiths, smite; with\r\n      strong arm and willing heart. This man and that, all stroke from\r\n      head to heel, shall thunder alternating, and ply the great\r\n      forge-hammer, till stithy reel and ring again; while ever and\r\n      anon, overhead, booms the alarm-cannon,—for the City has now got\r\n      gunpowder. Pikes are fabricated; fifty thousand of them, in\r\n      six-and-thirty hours: judge whether the Black-aproned have been\r\n      idle. Dig trenches, unpave the streets, ye others, assiduous, man\r\n      and maid; cram the earth in barrel-barricades, at each of them a\r\n      volunteer sentry; pile the whinstones in window-sills and upper\r\n      rooms. Have scalding pitch, at least boiling water ready, ye weak\r\n      old women, to pour it and dash it on Royal-Allemand, with your\r\n      old skinny arms: your shrill curses along with it will not be\r\n      wanting!—Patrols of the newborn National Guard, bearing torches,\r\n      scour the streets, all that night; which otherwise are vacant,\r\n      yet illuminated in every window by order. Strange-looking; like\r\n      some naphtha-lighted City of the Dead, with here and there a\r\n      flight of perturbed Ghosts.\r\n\r\n      O poor mortals, how ye make this Earth bitter for each other;\r\n      this fearful and wonderful Life fearful and horrible; and Satan\r\n      has his place in all hearts! Such agonies and ragings and\r\n      wailings ye have, and have had, in all times:—to be buried all,\r\n      in so deep silence; and the salt sea is not swoln with your\r\n      tears.\r\n\r\n      Great meanwhile is the moment, when tidings of Freedom reach us;\r\n      when the long-enthralled soul, from amid its chains and squalid\r\n      stagnancy, arises, were it still only in blindness and\r\n      bewilderment, and swears by Him that made it, that it will be\r\n      _free!_ Free? Understand that well, it is the deep commandment,\r\n      dimmer or clearer, of our whole being, to be _free_. Freedom is\r\n      the one purport, wisely aimed at, or unwisely, of all man’s\r\n      struggles, toilings and sufferings, in this Earth. Yes, supreme\r\n      is such a moment (if thou have known it): first vision as of a\r\n      flame-girt Sinai, in this our waste Pilgrimage,—which thenceforth\r\n      wants not its pillar of cloud by day, and pillar of fire by\r\n      night! Something it is even,—nay, something considerable, when\r\n      the chains have grown _corrosive_, poisonous, to be free “from\r\n      oppression by our fellow-man.” Forward, ye maddened sons of\r\n      France; be it towards this destiny or towards that! Around you is\r\n      but starvation, falsehood, corruption and the clam of death.\r\n      Where ye are is no abiding.\r\n\r\n      Imagination may, imperfectly, figure how Commandant Besenval, in\r\n      the Champ-de-Mars, has worn out these sorrowful hours\r\n      Insurrection all round; his men melting away! From Versailles, to\r\n      the most pressing messages, comes no answer; or once only some\r\n      vague word of answer which is worse than none. A Council of\r\n      Officers can decide merely that there is no decision: Colonels\r\n      inform him, “weeping,” that they do not think their men will\r\n      fight. Cruel uncertainty is here: war-god Broglie sits yonder,\r\n      inaccessible in his Olympus; does not descend terror-clad, does\r\n      not produce his whiff of grapeshot; sends no orders.\r\n\r\n      Truly, in the Château of Versailles all seems mystery: in the\r\n      Town of Versailles, were we there, all is rumour, alarm and\r\n      indignation. An august National Assembly sits, to appearance,\r\n      menaced with death; endeavouring to defy death. It has resolved\r\n      “that Necker carries with him the regrets of the Nation.” It has\r\n      sent solemn Deputation over to the Château, with entreaty to have\r\n      these troops withdrawn. In vain: his Majesty, with a singular\r\n      composure, invites us to be busy rather with our own duty, making\r\n      the Constitution! Foreign Pandours, and suchlike, go pricking and\r\n      prancing, with a swashbuckler air; with an eye too probably to\r\n      the _Salle des Menus_,—were it not for the “grim-looking\r\n      countenances” that crowd all avenues there.[177] Be firm, ye\r\n      National Senators; the cynosure of a firm, grim-looking people!\r\n\r\n      The august National Senators determine that there shall, at\r\n      least, be Permanent Session till this thing end. Wherein,\r\n      however, consider that worthy Lafranc de Pompignan, our new\r\n      President, whom we have named Bailly’s successor, is an old man,\r\n      wearied with many things. He is the Brother of that Pompignan who\r\n      meditated lamentably on the Book of _Lamentations:_\r\n\r\n     Saves-voux pourquoi Jérémie\r\n     Se lamentait toute sa vie?\r\n     C’est qu’il prévoyait\r\n     Que Pompignan le traduirait!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Poor Bishop Pompignan withdraws; having got Lafayette for helper\r\n      or substitute: this latter, as nocturnal Vice-President, with a\r\n      thin house in disconsolate humour, sits sleepless, with lights\r\n      unsnuffed;—waiting what the hours will bring.\r\n\r\n      So at Versailles. But at Paris, agitated Besenval, before\r\n      retiring for the night, has stept over to old M. de Sombreuil, of\r\n      the _Hôtel des Invalides_ hard by. M. de Sombreuil has, what is a\r\n      great secret, some eight-and-twenty thousand stand of muskets\r\n      deposited in his cellars there; but no trust in the temper of his\r\n      Invalides. This day, for example, he sent twenty of the fellows\r\n      down to unscrew those muskets; lest Sedition might snatch at\r\n      them; but scarcely, in six hours, had the twenty unscrewed twenty\r\n      gun-locks, or dogsheads (_chiens_) of locks,—each Invalide his\r\n      dogshead! If ordered to fire, they would, he imagines, turn their\r\n      cannon against himself.\r\n\r\n      Unfortunate old military gentlemen, it is your hour, not of\r\n      glory! Old Marquis de Launay too, of the Bastille, has pulled up\r\n      his drawbridges long since, “and retired into his interior;” with\r\n      sentries walking on his battlements, under the midnight sky,\r\n      aloft over the glare of illuminated Paris;—whom a National\r\n      Patrol, passing that way, takes the liberty of firing at; “seven\r\n      shots towards twelve at night,” which do not take effect.[178]\r\n      This was the 13th day of July, 1789; a worse day, many said, than\r\n      the last 13th was, when only hail fell out of Heaven, not madness\r\n      rose out of Tophet, ruining worse than crops!\r\n\r\n      In these same days, as Chronology will teach us, hot old Marquis\r\n      Mirabeau lies stricken down, at Argenteuil,—_not_ within sound of\r\n      these alarm-guns; for _he_ properly is not there, and only the\r\n      body of him now lies, deaf and cold forever. It was on Saturday\r\n      night that he, drawing his last life-breaths, gave up the ghost\r\n      there;—leaving a world, which would never go to his mind, now\r\n      broken out, seemingly, into deliration and the _culbute\r\n      générale_. What is it to him, departing elsewhither, on his long\r\n      journey? The old Château Mirabeau stands silent, far off, on its\r\n      scarped rock, in that “gorge of two windy valleys;” the\r\n      pale-fading spectre now of a Château: this huge World-riot, and\r\n      France, and the World itself, fades also, like a shadow on the\r\n      great still mirror-sea; and all shall be as God wills.\r\n\r\n      Young Mirabeau, sad of heart, for he loved this crabbed brave old\r\n      Father, sad of heart, and occupied with sad cares,—is withdrawn\r\n      from Public History. The great crisis transacts itself without\r\n      him.[179]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.VI.\r\n      Storm and Victory.\r\n\r\n      But, to the living and the struggling, a new, Fourteenth morning\r\n      dawns. Under all roofs of this distracted City, is the nodus of a\r\n      drama, not untragical, crowding towards solution. The bustlings\r\n      and preparings, the tremors and menaces; the tears that fell from\r\n      old eyes! This day, my sons, ye shall quit you like men. By the\r\n      memory of your fathers’ wrongs, by the hope of your children’s\r\n      rights! Tyranny impends in red wrath: help for you is none if not\r\n      in your own right hands. This day ye must do or die.\r\n\r\n      From earliest light, a sleepless Permanent Committee has heard\r\n      the old cry, now waxing almost frantic, mutinous: Arms! Arms!\r\n      Provost Flesselles, or what traitors there are among you, may\r\n      think of those Charleville Boxes. A hundred-and-fifty thousand of\r\n      us; and but the third man furnished with so much as a pike! Arms\r\n      are the one thing needful: with arms we are an unconquerable\r\n      man-defying National Guard; without arms, a rabble to be whiffed\r\n      with grapeshot.\r\n\r\n      Happily the word has arisen, for no secret can be kept,—that\r\n      there lie muskets at the _Hôtel des Invalides_. Thither will we:\r\n      King’s Procureur M. Ethys de Corny, and whatsoever of authority a\r\n      Permanent Committee can lend, shall go with us. Besenval’s Camp\r\n      is there; perhaps he will not fire on us; if he kill us we shall\r\n      but die.\r\n\r\n      Alas, poor Besenval, with his troops melting away in that manner,\r\n      has not the smallest humour to fire! At five o’clock this\r\n      morning, as he lay dreaming, oblivious in the _Ecole Militaire_,\r\n      a “figure” stood suddenly at his bedside: “with face rather\r\n      handsome; eyes inflamed, speech rapid and curt, air audacious:”\r\n      such a figure drew Priam’s curtains! The message and monition of\r\n      the figure was, that resistance would be hopeless; that if blood\r\n      flowed, wo to him who shed it. Thus spoke the figure; and\r\n      vanished. “Withal there was a kind of eloquence that struck one.”\r\n      Besenval admits that he should have arrested him, but did\r\n      not.[180] Who this figure, with inflamed eyes, with speech rapid\r\n      and curt, might be? Besenval knows but mentions not. Camille\r\n      Desmoulins? Pythagorean Marquis Valadi, inflamed with “violent\r\n      motions all night at the Palais Royal?” Fame names him, “Young M.\r\n      Meillar”;[181] Then shuts her lips about him for ever.\r\n\r\n      In any case, behold about nine in the morning, our National\r\n      Volunteers rolling in long wide flood, south-westward to the\r\n      _Hôtel des Invalides;_ in search of the one thing needful. King’s\r\n      procureur M. Ethys de Corny and officials are there; the Curé of\r\n      Saint-Etienne du Mont marches unpacific, at the head of his\r\n      militant Parish; the Clerks of the Bazoche in red coats we see\r\n      marching, now Volunteers of the Bazoche; the Volunteers of the\r\n      Palais Royal:—National Volunteers, numerable by tens of\r\n      thousands; of one heart and mind. The King’s muskets are the\r\n      Nation’s; think, old M. de Sombreuil, how, in this extremity,\r\n      thou wilt refuse them! Old M. de Sombreuil would fain hold\r\n      parley, send Couriers; but it skills not: the walls are scaled,\r\n      no Invalide firing a shot; the gates must be flung open.\r\n      Patriotism rushes in, tumultuous, from grundsel up to ridge-tile,\r\n      through all rooms and passages; rummaging distractedly for arms.\r\n      What cellar, or what cranny can escape it? The arms are found;\r\n      all safe there; lying packed in straw,—apparently with a view to\r\n      being burnt! More ravenous than famishing lions over dead prey,\r\n      the multitude, with clangour and vociferation, pounces on them;\r\n      struggling, dashing, clutching:—to the jamming-up, to the\r\n      pressure, fracture and probable extinction, of the weaker\r\n      Patriot.[182] And so, with such protracted crash of deafening,\r\n      most discordant Orchestra-music, the Scene is changed: and\r\n      eight-and-twenty thousand sufficient firelocks are on the\r\n      shoulders of so many National Guards, lifted thereby out of\r\n      darkness into fiery light.\r\n\r\n      Let Besenval look at the glitter of these muskets, as they flash\r\n      by! Gardes Françaises, it is said, have cannon levelled on him;\r\n      ready to open, if need were, from the other side of the\r\n      River.[183] Motionless sits he; “astonished,” one may flatter\r\n      oneself, “at the proud bearing (_fière contenance_) of the\r\n      Parisians.”—And now, to the Bastille, ye intrepid Parisians!\r\n      There grapeshot still threatens; thither all men’s thoughts and\r\n      steps are now tending.\r\n\r\n      Old de Launay, as we hinted, withdrew “into his interior” soon\r\n      after midnight of Sunday. He remains there ever since, hampered,\r\n      as all military gentlemen now are, in the saddest conflict of\r\n      uncertainties. The Hôtel-de-Ville “invites” him to admit National\r\n      Soldiers, which is a soft name for surrendering. On the other\r\n      hand, His Majesty’s orders were precise. His garrison is but\r\n      eighty-two old Invalides, reinforced by thirty-two young Swiss;\r\n      his walls indeed are nine feet thick, he has cannon and powder;\r\n      but, alas, only one day’s provision of victuals. The city too is\r\n      French, the poor garrison mostly French. Rigorous old de Launay,\r\n      think what thou wilt do!\r\n\r\n      All morning, since nine, there has been a cry everywhere: To the\r\n      Bastille! Repeated “deputations of citizens” have been here,\r\n      passionate for arms; whom de Launay has got dismissed by soft\r\n      speeches through portholes. Towards noon, Elector Thuriot de la\r\n      Rosiere gains admittance; finds de Launay indisposed for\r\n      surrender; nay disposed for blowing up the place rather. Thuriot\r\n      mounts with him to the battlements: heaps of paving-stones, old\r\n      iron and missiles lie piled; cannon all duly levelled; in every\r\n      embrasure a cannon,—only drawn back a little! But outwards\r\n      behold, O Thuriot, how the multitude flows on, welling through\r\n      every street; tocsin furiously pealing, all drums beating the\r\n      _générale:_ the Suburb Saint-Antoine rolling hitherward wholly,\r\n      as one man! Such vision (spectral yet real) thou, O Thuriot, as\r\n      from thy Mount of Vision, beholdest in this moment: prophetic of\r\n      what other Phantasmagories, and loud-gibbering Spectral\r\n      Realities, which, thou yet beholdest not, but shalt! ‘_Que voulez\r\n      vous?_’ said de Launay, turning pale at the sight, with an air of\r\n      reproach, almost of menace. ‘Monsieur,’ said Thuriot, rising into\r\n      the moral-sublime, ‘What mean _you?_ Consider if I could not\r\n      precipitate _both_ of us from this height,’—say only a hundred\r\n      feet, exclusive of the walled ditch! Whereupon de Launay fell\r\n      silent. Thuriot shews himself from some pinnacle, to comfort the\r\n      multitude becoming suspicious, fremescent: then descends; departs\r\n      with protest; with warning addressed also to the Invalides,—on\r\n      whom, however, it produces but a mixed indistinct impression. The\r\n      old heads are none of the clearest; besides, it is said, de\r\n      Launay has been profuse of beverages (_prodigua des buissons_).\r\n      They think, they will not fire,—if not fired on, if they can help\r\n      it; but must, on the whole, be ruled considerably by\r\n      circumstances.\r\n\r\n      Wo to thee, de Launay, in such an hour, if thou canst not, taking\r\n      some one firm decision, _rule_ circumstances! Soft speeches will\r\n      not serve; hard grape-shot is questionable; but hovering between\r\n      the two is _un_questionable. Ever wilder swells the tide of men;\r\n      their infinite hum waxing ever louder, into imprecations, perhaps\r\n      into crackle of stray musketry,—which latter, on walls nine feet\r\n      thick, cannot do execution. The Outer Drawbridge has been lowered\r\n      for Thuriot; new _deputation of citizens_ (it is the third, and\r\n      noisiest of all) penetrates that way into the Outer Court: soft\r\n      speeches producing no clearance of these, de Launay gives fire;\r\n      pulls up his Drawbridge. A slight sputter;—which has _kindled_\r\n      the too combustible chaos; made it a roaring fire-chaos! Bursts\r\n      forth insurrection, at sight of its own blood (for there were\r\n      deaths by that sputter of fire), into endless rolling explosion\r\n      of musketry, distraction, execration;—and overhead, from the\r\n      Fortress, let one great gun, with its grape-shot, go booming, to\r\n      shew what we _could_ do. The Bastille is besieged!\r\n\r\n      On, then, all Frenchmen that have hearts in their bodies! Roar\r\n      with all your throats, of cartilage and metal, ye Sons of\r\n      Liberty; stir spasmodically whatsoever of utmost faculty is in\r\n      you, soul, body or spirit; for it is the hour! Smite, thou Louis\r\n      Tournay, cartwright of the Marais, old-soldier of the Regiment\r\n      Dauphine; smite at that Outer Drawbridge chain, though the fiery\r\n      hail whistles round thee! Never, over nave or felloe, did thy axe\r\n      strike such a stroke. Down with it, man; down with it to Orcus:\r\n      let the whole accursed Edifice sink thither, and Tyranny be\r\n      swallowed up for ever! Mounted, some say on the roof of the\r\n      guard-room, some “on bayonets stuck into joints of the wall,”\r\n      Louis Tournay smites, brave Aubin Bonnemere (also an old soldier)\r\n      seconding him: the chain yields, breaks; the huge Drawbridge\r\n      slams down, thundering (_avec fracas_). Glorious: and yet, alas,\r\n      it is still but the outworks. The Eight grim Towers, with their\r\n      Invalides’ musketry, their paving stones and cannon-mouths, still\r\n      soar aloft intact;—Ditch yawning impassable, stone-faced; the\r\n      inner Drawbridge with its _back_ towards us: the Bastille is\r\n      still to take!\r\n\r\n      To describe this Siege of the Bastille (thought to be one of the\r\n      most important in history) perhaps transcends the talent of\r\n      mortals. Could one but, after infinite reading, get to understand\r\n      so much as the plan of the building! But there is open Esplanade,\r\n      at the end of the Rue Saint-Antoine; there are such Forecourts,\r\n      _Cour Avancé, Cour de l’Orme_, arched Gateway (where Louis\r\n      Tournay now fights); then new drawbridges, dormant-bridges,\r\n      rampart-bastions, and the grim Eight Towers: a labyrinthic Mass,\r\n      high-frowning there, of all ages from twenty years to four\r\n      hundred and twenty;—beleaguered, in this its last hour, as we\r\n      said, by mere Chaos come again! Ordnance of all calibres; throats\r\n      of all capacities; men of all plans, every man his own engineer:\r\n      seldom since the war of Pygmies and Cranes was there seen so\r\n      anomalous a thing. Half-pay Elie is home for a suit of\r\n      regimentals; no one would heed him in coloured clothes: half-pay\r\n      Hulin is haranguing Gardes Françaises in the Place de Grève.\r\n      Frantic Patriots pick up the grape-shots; bear them, still hot\r\n      (or seemingly so), to the Hôtel-de-Ville:—Paris, you perceive, is\r\n      to be burnt! Flesselles is “pale to the very lips” for the roar\r\n      of the multitude grows deep. Paris wholly has got to the acme of\r\n      its frenzy; whirled, all ways, by panic madness. At every\r\n      street-barricade, there whirls simmering, a minor\r\n      whirlpool,—strengthening the barricade, since God knows what is\r\n      coming; and all minor whirlpools play distractedly into that\r\n      grand Fire-Mahlstrom which is lashing round the Bastille.\r\n\r\n      And so it lashes and it roars. Cholat the wine-merchant has\r\n      become an impromptu cannoneer. See Georget, of the Marine\r\n      Service, fresh from Brest, ply the King of Siam’s cannon.\r\n      Singular (if we were not used to the like): Georget lay, last\r\n      night, taking his ease at his inn; the King of Siam’s cannon also\r\n      lay, knowing nothing of _him_, for a hundred years. Yet now, at\r\n      the right instant, they have got together, and discourse eloquent\r\n      music. For, hearing what was toward, Georget sprang from the\r\n      Brest Diligence, and ran. Gardes Françaises also will be here,\r\n      with real artillery: were not the walls so thick!—Upwards from\r\n      the Esplanade, horizontally from all neighbouring roofs and\r\n      windows, flashes one irregular deluge of musketry,—without\r\n      effect. The Invalides lie flat, firing comparatively at their\r\n      ease from behind stone; hardly through portholes, shew the tip of\r\n      a nose. We fall, shot; and make no impression!\r\n\r\n      Let conflagration rage; of whatsoever is combustible! Guard-rooms\r\n      are burnt, Invalides mess-rooms. A distracted “Peruke-maker with\r\n      two fiery torches” is for burning “the saltpetres of the\r\n      Arsenal;”—had not a woman run screaming; had not a Patriot, with\r\n      some tincture of Natural Philosophy, instantly struck the wind\r\n      out of him (butt of musket on pit of stomach), overturned\r\n      barrels, and stayed the devouring element. A young beautiful\r\n      lady, seized escaping in these Outer Courts, and thought falsely\r\n      to be de Launay’s daughter, shall be burnt in de Launay’s sight;\r\n      she lies swooned on a paillasse: but again a Patriot, it is brave\r\n      Aubin Bonnemere the old soldier, dashes in, and rescues her.\r\n      Straw is burnt; three cartloads of it, hauled thither, go up in\r\n      white smoke: almost to the choking of Patriotism itself; so that\r\n      Elie had, with singed brows, to drag back one cart; and Reole the\r\n      “gigantic haberdasher” another. Smoke as of Tophet; confusion as\r\n      of Babel; noise as of the Crack of Doom!\r\n\r\n      Blood flows, the aliment of new madness. The wounded are carried\r\n      into houses of the Rue Cerisaie; the dying leave their last\r\n      mandate not to yield till the accursed Stronghold fall. And yet,\r\n      alas, how fall? The walls are so thick! Deputations, three in\r\n      number, arrive from the Hôtel-de-Ville; Abbé Fouchet (who was of\r\n      one) can say, with what almost superhuman courage of\r\n      benevolence.[184] These wave their Town-flag in the arched\r\n      Gateway; and stand, rolling their drum; but to no purpose. In\r\n      such Crack of Doom, de Launay cannot hear them, dare not believe\r\n      them: they return, with justified rage, the whew of lead still\r\n      singing in their ears. What to do? The Firemen are here,\r\n      squirting with their fire-pumps on the Invalides’ cannon, to wet\r\n      the touchholes; they unfortunately cannot squirt so high; but\r\n      produce only clouds of spray. Individuals of classical knowledge\r\n      propose _catapults_. Santerre, the sonorous Brewer of the Suburb\r\n      Saint-Antoine, advises rather that the place be fired, by a\r\n      “mixture of phosphorous and oil-of-turpentine spouted up through\r\n      forcing pumps:” O Spinola-Santerre, hast thou the mixture\r\n      _ready?_ Every man his own engineer! And still the fire-deluge\r\n      abates not; even women are firing, and Turks; at least one woman\r\n      (with her sweetheart), and one Turk.[185] Gardes Françaises have\r\n      come: real cannon, real cannoneers. Usher Maillard is busy;\r\n      half-pay Elie, half-pay Hulin rage in the midst of thousands.\r\n\r\n      How the great Bastille Clock ticks (inaudible) in its Inner Court\r\n      there, at its ease, hour after hour; as if nothing special, for\r\n      it or the world, were passing! It tolled One when the firing\r\n      began; and is now pointing towards Five, and still the firing\r\n      slakes not.—Far down, in their vaults, the seven Prisoners hear\r\n      muffled din as of earthquakes; their Turnkeys answer vaguely.\r\n\r\n      Wo to thee, de Launay, with thy poor hundred Invalides! Broglie\r\n      is distant, and his ears heavy: Besenval hears, but can send no\r\n      help. One poor troop of Hussars has crept, reconnoitring,\r\n      cautiously along the Quais, as far as the Pont Neuf. ‘We are come\r\n      to join you,’ said the Captain; for the crowd seems shoreless. A\r\n      large-headed dwarfish individual, of smoke-bleared aspect,\r\n      shambles forward, opening his blue lips, for there is sense in\r\n      him; and croaks: ‘Alight then, and give up your arms!’ the\r\n      Hussar-Captain is too happy to be escorted to the Barriers, and\r\n      dismissed on parole. Who the squat individual was? Men answer, it\r\n      is M. Marat, author of the excellent pacific _Avis au Peuple!_\r\n      Great truly, O thou remarkable Dogleech, is this thy day of\r\n      emergence and new birth: and yet this same day come four\r\n      years—!—But let the curtains of the future hang.\r\n\r\n      What shall de Launay do? One thing only de Launay could have\r\n      done: what he said he would do. Fancy him sitting, from the\r\n      first, with lighted taper, within arm’s length of the\r\n      Powder-Magazine; motionless, like old Roman Senator, or bronze\r\n      Lamp-holder; coldly apprising Thuriot, and all men, by a slight\r\n      motion of his eye, what his resolution was:—Harmless he sat\r\n      there, while unharmed; but the King’s Fortress, meanwhile, could,\r\n      might, would, or should, in nowise, be surrendered, save to the\r\n      King’s Messenger: one old man’s life worthless, so it be lost\r\n      with honour; but think, ye brawling _canaille_, how will it be\r\n      when a whole Bastille springs skyward!—In such statuesque,\r\n      taper-holding attitude, one fancies de Launay might have left\r\n      Thuriot, the red Clerks of the Bazoche, Curé of Saint-Stephen and\r\n      all the tagrag-and-bobtail of the world, to work their will.\r\n\r\n      And yet, withal, he could not do it. Hast thou considered how\r\n      each man’s heart is so tremulously responsive to the hearts of\r\n      all men; hast thou noted how omnipotent is the very sound of many\r\n      men? How their shriek of indignation palsies the strong soul;\r\n      their howl of contumely withers with unfelt pangs? The Ritter\r\n      Gluck confessed that the ground-tone of the noblest passage, in\r\n      one of his noblest Operas, was the voice of the Populace he had\r\n      heard at Vienna, crying to their Kaiser: Bread! Bread! Great is\r\n      the combined voice of men; the utterance of their _instincts_,\r\n      which are truer than their _thoughts:_ it is the greatest a man\r\n      encounters, among the sounds and shadows, which make up this\r\n      World of Time. He who can resist that, has his footing some where\r\n      _beyond_ Time. De Launay could not do it. Distracted, he hovers\r\n      between the two; hopes in the middle of despair; surrenders not\r\n      his Fortress; declares that he will blow it up, seizes torches to\r\n      blow it up, and does not blow it. Unhappy old de Launay, it is\r\n      the death-agony of thy Bastille and thee! Jail, Jailoring and\r\n      Jailor, all three, such as they may have been, must finish.\r\n\r\n      For four hours now has the World-Bedlam roared: call it the\r\n      World-Chimaera, blowing fire! The poor Invalides have sunk under\r\n      their battlements, or rise only with reversed muskets: they have\r\n      made a white flag of napkins; go beating the _chamade_, or\r\n      seeming to beat, for one can hear nothing. The very Swiss at the\r\n      Portcullis look weary of firing; disheartened in the fire-deluge:\r\n      a porthole at the drawbridge is opened, as by one that would\r\n      speak. See Huissier Maillard, the shifty man! On his plank,\r\n      swinging over the abyss of that stone-Ditch; plank resting on\r\n      parapet, balanced by weight of Patriots,—he hovers perilous: such\r\n      a Dove towards such an Ark! Deftly, thou shifty Usher: one man\r\n      already fell; and lies smashed, far down there, against the\r\n      masonry! Usher Maillard falls not: deftly, unerring he walks,\r\n      with outspread palm. The Swiss holds a paper through his\r\n      porthole; the shifty Usher snatches it, and returns. Terms of\r\n      surrender: Pardon, immunity to all! Are they accepted?—‘_Foi\r\n      d’officier_, On the word of an officer,’ answers half-pay\r\n      Hulin,—or half-pay Elie, for men do not agree on it, ‘they are!’\r\n      Sinks the drawbridge,—Usher Maillard bolting it when down;\r\n      rushes-in the living deluge: the Bastille is fallen! _Victoire!\r\n      La Bastille est prise!_[186]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.VII.\r\n      Not a Revolt.\r\n\r\n      Why dwell on what follows? Hulin’s _foi d’officier_ should have\r\n      been kept, but could not. The Swiss stand drawn up; disguised in\r\n      white canvas smocks; the Invalides without disguise; their arms\r\n      all piled against the wall. The first rush of victors, in ecstacy\r\n      that the death-peril is passed, “leaps joyfully on their necks;”\r\n      but new victors rush, and ever new, also in ecstacy not wholly of\r\n      joy. As we said, it was a living deluge, plunging headlong; had\r\n      not the Gardes Françaises, in their cool military way, “wheeled\r\n      round with arms levelled,” it would have plunged suicidally, by\r\n      the hundred or the thousand, into the Bastille-ditch.\r\n\r\n      And so it goes plunging through court and corridor; billowing\r\n      uncontrollable, firing from windows—on itself: in hot frenzy of\r\n      triumph, of grief and vengeance for its slain. The poor Invalides\r\n      will fare ill; one Swiss, running off in his white smock, is\r\n      driven back, with a death-thrust. Let all prisoners be marched to\r\n      the Townhall, to be judged!—Alas, already one poor Invalide has\r\n      his right hand slashed off him; his maimed body dragged to the\r\n      Place de Grève, and hanged there. This same right hand, it is\r\n      said, turned back de Launay from the Powder-Magazine, and saved\r\n      Paris.\r\n\r\n      De Launay, “discovered in gray frock with poppy-coloured riband,”\r\n      is for killing himself with the sword of his cane. He shall to\r\n      the Hôtel-de-Ville; Hulin Maillard and others escorting him; Elie\r\n      marching foremost “with the capitulation-paper on his sword’s\r\n      point.” Through roarings and cursings; through hustlings,\r\n      clutchings, and at last through strokes! Your escort is hustled\r\n      aside, felled down; Hulin sinks exhausted on a heap of stones.\r\n      Miserable de Launay! He shall never enter the Hotel de Ville:\r\n      only his “bloody hair-queue, held up in a bloody hand;” that\r\n      shall enter, for a sign. The bleeding trunk lies on the steps\r\n      there; the head is off through the streets; ghastly, aloft on a\r\n      pike.\r\n\r\n      Rigorous de Launay has died; crying out, ‘O friends, kill me\r\n      fast!’ Merciful de Losme must die; though Gratitude embraces him,\r\n      in this fearful hour, and will die for him; it avails not.\r\n      Brothers, your wrath is cruel! Your Place de Grève is become a\r\n      Throat of the Tiger; full of mere fierce bellowings, and thirst\r\n      of blood. One other officer is massacred; one other Invalide is\r\n      hanged on the Lamp-iron: with difficulty, with generous\r\n      perseverance, the Gardes Françaises will save the rest. Provost\r\n      Flesselles stricken long since with the paleness of death, must\r\n      descend from his seat, “to be judged at the Palais Royal:”—alas,\r\n      to be shot dead, by an unknown hand, at the turning of the first\r\n      street!—\r\n\r\n      O evening sun of July, how, at this hour, thy beams fall slant on\r\n      reapers amid peaceful woody fields; on old women spinning in\r\n      cottages; on ships far out in the silent main; on Balls at the\r\n      Orangerie of Versailles, where high-rouged Dames of the Palace\r\n      are even now dancing with double-jacketted Hussar-Officers;—and\r\n      also on this roaring Hell porch of a Hôtel-de-Ville! Babel Tower,\r\n      with the confusion of tongues, were not Bedlam added with the\r\n      conflagration of thoughts, was no type of it. One forest of\r\n      distracted steel bristles, endless, in front of an Electoral\r\n      Committee; points itself, in horrid radii, against this and the\r\n      other accused breast. It was the Titans warring with Olympus; and\r\n      they scarcely crediting it, have _conquered:_ prodigy of\r\n      prodigies; delirious,—as it could not but be. Denunciation,\r\n      vengeance; blaze of triumph on a dark ground of terror: all\r\n      outward, all inward things fallen into one general wreck of\r\n      madness!\r\n\r\n      Electoral Committee? Had it a thousand throats of brass, it would\r\n      not suffice. Abbé Lefevre, in the Vaults down below, is black as\r\n      Vulcan, distributing that “five thousand weight of Powder;” with\r\n      what perils, these eight-and-forty hours! Last night, a Patriot,\r\n      in liquor, insisted on sitting to smoke on the edge of one of the\r\n      Powder-barrels; there smoked he, independent of the world,—till\r\n      the Abbé “purchased his pipe for three francs,” and pitched it\r\n      far.\r\n\r\n      Elie, in the grand Hall, Electoral Committee looking on, sits\r\n      “with drawn sword bent in three places;” with battered helm, for\r\n      he was of the Queen’s Regiment, Cavalry; with torn regimentals,\r\n      face singed and soiled; comparable, some think, to “an antique\r\n      warrior;”—judging the people; forming a list of Bastille Heroes.\r\n      O Friends, stain not with blood the greenest laurels ever gained\r\n      in this world: such is the burden of Elie’s song; could it but be\r\n      listened to. Courage, Elie! Courage, ye Municipal Electors! A\r\n      declining sun; the need of victuals, and of telling news, will\r\n      bring assuagement, dispersion: all earthly things must end.\r\n\r\n      Along the streets of Paris circulate Seven Bastille Prisoners,\r\n      borne shoulder-high: seven Heads on pikes; the Keys of the\r\n      Bastille; and much else. See also the Garde Françaises, in their\r\n      steadfast military way, marching home to their barracks, with the\r\n      Invalides and Swiss kindly enclosed in hollow square. It is one\r\n      year and two months since these same men stood unparticipating,\r\n      with Brennus d’Agoust at the Palais de Justice, when Fate\r\n      overtook d’Espréménil; and now they have participated; and will\r\n      participate. Not Gardes Françaises henceforth, but _Centre\r\n      Grenadiers of the National Guard:_ men of iron discipline and\r\n      humour,—not without a kind of thought in them!\r\n\r\n      Likewise ashlar stones of the Bastille continue thundering\r\n      through the dusk; its paper-archives shall fly white. Old secrets\r\n      come to view; and long-buried Despair finds voice. Read this\r\n      portion of an old Letter:[187] “If for my consolation Monseigneur\r\n      would grant me for the sake of God and the Most Blessed Trinity,\r\n      that I could have news of my dear wife; were it only her name on\r\n      card to shew that she is alive! It were the greatest consolation\r\n      I could receive; and I should for ever bless the greatness of\r\n      Monseigneur.” Poor Prisoner, who namest thyself _Quéret Démery_,\r\n      and hast no other history,—she is _dead_, that dear wife of\r\n      thine, and thou art dead! ’Tis fifty years since thy breaking\r\n      heart put this question; to be heard now first, and long heard,\r\n      in the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n      But so does the July twilight thicken; so must Paris, as sick\r\n      children, and all distracted creatures do, brawl itself finally\r\n      into a kind of sleep. Municipal Electors, astonished to find\r\n      their heads still uppermost, are home: only Moreau de Saint-Méry\r\n      of tropical birth and heart, of coolest judgment; he, with two\r\n      others, shall sit permanent at the Townhall. Paris sleeps; gleams\r\n      upward the illuminated City: patrols go clashing, without common\r\n      watchword; there go rumours; alarms of war, to the extent of\r\n      “fifteen thousand men marching through the Suburb\r\n      Saint-Antoine,”—who never got it marched through. Of the day’s\r\n      distraction judge by this of the night: Moreau de Saint-Méry,\r\n      “before rising from his seat, gave upwards of three thousand\r\n      orders.”[188] What a head; comparable to Friar Bacon’s Brass\r\n      Head! Within it lies all Paris. Prompt must the answer be, right\r\n      or wrong; in Paris is no other Authority extant. Seriously, a\r\n      most cool clear head;—for which also thou O brave Saint-Méry, in\r\n      many capacities, from august Senator to Merchant’s-Clerk,\r\n      Book-dealer, Vice-King; in many places, from Virginia to\r\n      Sardinia, shalt, ever as a brave man, find employment.[189]\r\n\r\n      Besenval has decamped, under cloud of dusk, “amid a great\r\n      affluence of people,” who did not harm him; he marches, with\r\n      faint-growing tread, down the left bank of the Seine, all\r\n      night,—towards infinite space. Resummoned shall Besenval himself\r\n      be; for trial, for difficult acquittal. His King’s-troops, his\r\n      Royal Allemand, are gone hence for ever.\r\n\r\n      The Versailles Ball and lemonade is done; the Orangery is silent\r\n      except for nightbirds. Over in the Salle des Menus,\r\n      Vice-president Lafayette, with unsnuffed lights, “with some\r\n      hundred of members, stretched on tables round him,” sits erect;\r\n      outwatching the Bear. This day, a second solemn Deputation went\r\n      to his Majesty; a second, and then a third: with no effect. What\r\n      will the end of these things be?\r\n\r\n      In the Court, all is mystery, not without whisperings of terror;\r\n      though ye dream of lemonade and epaulettes, ye foolish women! His\r\n      Majesty, kept in happy ignorance, perhaps dreams of\r\n      double-barrels and the Woods of Meudon. Late at night, the Duke\r\n      de Liancourt, having official right of entrance, gains access to\r\n      the Royal Apartments; unfolds, with earnest clearness, in his\r\n      constitutional way, the Job’s-news. ‘_Mais_,’ said poor Louis,\r\n      ‘_c’est une révolte_, Why, that is a revolt!’—‘Sire,’ answered\r\n      Liancourt, ‘It is not a revolt, it is a revolution.’\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.VIII.\r\n      Conquering your King.\r\n\r\n      On the morrow a fourth Deputation to the Château is on foot: of a\r\n      more solemn, not to say awful character, for, besides “orgies in\r\n      the Orangery,” it seems, “the grain convoys are all stopped;” nor\r\n      has Mirabeau’s thunder been silent. Such Deputation is on the\r\n      point of setting out—when lo, his Majesty himself attended only\r\n      by his two Brothers, step in; quite in the paternal manner;\r\n      announces that the troops, and all causes of offence, are gone,\r\n      and henceforth there shall be nothing but trust, reconcilement,\r\n      good-will; whereof he “permits and even requests,” a National\r\n      Assembly to assure Paris in his name! Acclamation, as of men\r\n      suddenly delivered from death, gives answer. The whole Assembly\r\n      spontaneously rises to escort his Majesty back; “interlacing\r\n      their arms to keep off the excessive pressure from him;” for all\r\n      Versailles is crowding and shouting. The Château Musicians, with\r\n      a felicitous promptitude, strike up the _Sein de sa Famille_\r\n      (Bosom of one’s Family): the Queen appears at the balcony with\r\n      her little boy and girl, “kissing them several times;” infinite\r\n      _Vivats_ spread far and wide;—and suddenly there has come, as it\r\n      were, a new Heaven-on-Earth.\r\n\r\n      Eighty-eight august Senators, Bailly, Lafayette, and our\r\n      repentant Archbishop among them, take coach for Paris, with the\r\n      great intelligence; benedictions without end on their heads. From\r\n      the Place Louis Quinze, where they alight, all the way to the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville, it is one sea of Tricolor cockades, of clear\r\n      National muskets; one tempest of huzzaings, hand-clappings, aided\r\n      by “occasional rollings” of drum-music. Harangues of due fervour\r\n      are delivered; especially by Lally Tollendal, pious son of the\r\n      ill-fated murdered Lally; on whose head, in consequence, a civic\r\n      crown (of oak or parsley) is forced,—which he forcibly transfers\r\n      to Bailly’s.\r\n\r\n      But surely, for one thing, the National Guard must have a\r\n      General! Moreau de Saint-Méry, he of the “three thousand orders,”\r\n      casts one of his significant glances on the Bust of Lafayette,\r\n      which has stood there ever since the American War of Liberty.\r\n      Whereupon, by acclamation, Lafayette is nominated. Again, in room\r\n      of the slain traitor or quasi-traitor Flesselles, President\r\n      Bailly shall be—Provost of the Merchants? No: Mayor of Paris! So\r\n      be it. _Maire de Paris!_ Mayor Bailly, General Lafayette; _vive\r\n      Bailly, vive Lafayette_—the universal out-of-doors multitude\r\n      rends the welkin in confirmation.—And now, finally, let us to\r\n      Notre-Dame for a _Te Deum._\r\n\r\n      Towards Notre-Dame Cathedral, in glad procession, these\r\n      Regenerators of the Country walk, through a jubilant people; in\r\n      fraternal manner; Abbé Lefevre, still black with his gunpowder\r\n      services, walking arm in arm with the white-stoled Archbishop.\r\n      Poor Bailly comes upon the Foundling Children, sent to kneel to\r\n      him; and “weeps.” _Te Deum_, our Archbishop officiating, is not\r\n      only sung, but _shot_—with blank cartridges. Our joy is boundless\r\n      as our wo threatened to be. Paris, by her own pike and musket,\r\n      and the valour of her own heart, has conquered the very\r\n      wargods,—to the satisfaction now of Majesty itself. A courier is,\r\n      this night, getting under way for Necker: the People’s Minister,\r\n      invited back by King, by National Assembly, and Nation, shall\r\n      traverse France amid shoutings, and the sound of trumpet and\r\n      timbrel.\r\n\r\n      Seeing which course of things, Messeigneurs of the Court\r\n      Triumvirate, Messieurs of the dead-born Broglie-Ministry, and\r\n      others such, consider that their part also is clear: to mount and\r\n      ride. Off, ye too-loyal Broglies, Polignacs, and Princes of the\r\n      Blood; off while it is yet time! Did not the Palais-Royal in its\r\n      late nocturnal “violent motions,” set a specific price (place of\r\n      payment not mentioned) on each of your heads?—With precautions,\r\n      with the aid of pieces of cannon and regiments that can be\r\n      depended on, Messeigneurs, between the 16th night and the 17th\r\n      morning, get to their several roads. Not without risk! Prince\r\n      Condé has (or seems to have) “men galloping at full speed;” with\r\n      a view, it is thought, to fling him into the river Oise, at\r\n      Pont-Sainte-Mayence.[190] The Polignacs travel disguised;\r\n      friends, not servants, on their coach-box. Broglie has his own\r\n      difficulties at Versailles, runs his own risks at Metz and\r\n      Verdun; does nevertheless get safe to Luxemburg, and there rests.\r\n\r\n      This is what they call the First Emigration; determined on, as\r\n      appears, in full Court-conclave; his Majesty assisting; prompt\r\n      he, for his share of it, to follow any counsel whatsoever. “Three\r\n      Sons of France, and four Princes of the blood of Saint Louis,”\r\n      says Weber, “could not more effectually humble the Burghers of\r\n      Paris than by appearing to withdraw in fear of their life.” Alas,\r\n      the Burghers of Paris bear it with unexpected Stoicism! The Man\r\n      d’Artois indeed is gone; but has he carried, for example, the\r\n      Land D’Artois with him? Not even Bagatelle the Country-house\r\n      (which shall be useful as a Tavern); hardly the four-valet\r\n      Breeches, leaving the Breeches-maker!—As for old Foulon, one\r\n      learns that he is dead; at least a “sumptuous funeral” is going\r\n      on; the undertakers honouring him, if no other will. Intendant\r\n      Berthier, his son-in-law, is still living; lurking: he joined\r\n      Besenval, on that Eumenides’ Sunday; appearing to treat it with\r\n      levity; and is now fled no man knows whither.\r\n\r\n      The Emigration is not gone many miles, Prince Condé hardly across\r\n      the Oise, when his Majesty, according to arrangement, for the\r\n      Emigration also thought it might do good,—undertakes a rather\r\n      daring enterprise: that of visiting Paris in person. With a\r\n      Hundred Members of Assembly; with small or no military escort,\r\n      which indeed he dismissed at the Bridge of Sèvres, poor Louis\r\n      sets out; leaving a desolate Palace; a Queen weeping, the\r\n      Present, the Past, and the Future all so unfriendly for her.\r\n\r\n      At the Barrier of Passy, Mayor Bailly, in grand gala, presents\r\n      him with the keys; harangues him, in Academic style; mentions\r\n      that it is a great day; that in Henri Quatre’s case, the King had\r\n      to make conquest of his People, but in this happier case, the\r\n      People makes conquest of its King (_a conquis son Roi_). The\r\n      King, so happily conquered, drives forward, slowly, through a\r\n      steel people, all silent, or shouting only _Vive la Nation;_ is\r\n      harangued at the Townhall, by Moreau of the three-thousand\r\n      orders, by King’s Procureur M. Ethys de Corny, by Lally\r\n      Tollendal, and others; knows not what to think of it, or say of\r\n      it; learns that he is “Restorer of French Liberty,”—as a Statue\r\n      of him, to be raised on the site of the Bastille, shall testify\r\n      to all men. Finally, he is shewn at the Balcony, with a Tricolor\r\n      cockade in his hat; is greeted now, with vehement acclamation,\r\n      from Square and Street, from all windows and roofs:—and so drives\r\n      home again amid glad mingled and, as it were, intermarried\r\n      shouts, of _Vive le Roi_ and _Vive la Nation;_ wearied but safe.\r\n\r\n      It was Sunday when the red-hot balls hung over us, in mid air: it\r\n      is now but Friday, and “the Revolution is sanctioned.” An August\r\n      National Assembly shall make the Constitution; and neither\r\n      foreign Pandour, domestic Triumvirate, with levelled Cannon,\r\n      Guy-Faux powder-plots (for that too was spoken of); nor any\r\n      tyrannic Power on the Earth, or under the Earth, shall say to it,\r\n      What dost thou?—So jubilates the people; sure now of a\r\n      Constitution. Cracked Marquis Saint-Huruge is heard under the\r\n      windows of the Château; murmuring sheer speculative-treason.[191]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.5.IX.\r\n      The Lanterne.\r\n\r\n      The Fall of the Bastille may be said to have shaken all France to\r\n      the deepest foundations of its existence. The rumour of these\r\n      wonders flies every where: with the natural speed of Rumour; with\r\n      an effect thought to be preternatural, produced by plots. Did\r\n      d’Orléans or Laclos, nay did Mirabeau (not overburdened with\r\n      money at this time) send riding Couriers out from Paris; to\r\n      gallop “on all radii,” or highways, towards all points of France?\r\n      It is a miracle, which no penetrating man will call in\r\n      question.[192]\r\n\r\n      Already in most Towns, Electoral Committees were met; to regret\r\n      Necker, in harangue and resolution. In many a Town, as Rennes,\r\n      Caen, Lyons, an ebullient people was already regretting him in\r\n      brickbats and musketry. But now, at every Town’s-end in France,\r\n      there do arrive, in these days of terror,—“men,” as men will\r\n      arrive; nay, “men on horseback,” since Rumour oftenest travels\r\n      riding. These men declare, with alarmed countenance, _The_\r\n      BRIGANDS to be coming, to be just at hand; and do then—ride on,\r\n      about their further business, be what it might! Whereupon the\r\n      whole population of such Town, defensively flies to arms.\r\n      Petition is soon thereafter forwarded to National Assembly; in\r\n      such peril and terror of peril, leave to organise yourself cannot\r\n      be withheld: the armed population becomes everywhere an enrolled\r\n      National Guard. Thus rides Rumour, careering along all radii,\r\n      from Paris outwards, to such purpose: in few days, some say in\r\n      not many hours, all France to the utmost borders bristles with\r\n      bayonets. Singular, but undeniable,—miraculous or not!—But thus\r\n      may any chemical liquid; though cooled to the freezing-point, or\r\n      far lower, still continue liquid; and then, on the slightest\r\n      stroke or shake, it at once rushes wholly into ice. Thus has\r\n      France, for long months and even years, been chemically dealt\r\n      with; brought below zero; and now, shaken by the Fall of a\r\n      Bastille, it instantaneously congeals: into one crystallised\r\n      mass, of sharp-cutting steel! _Guai a chi la tocca;_ ’Ware who\r\n      touches it!\r\n\r\n      In Paris, an Electoral Committee, with a new Mayor and General,\r\n      is urgent with belligerent workmen to resume their handicrafts.\r\n      Strong Dames of the Market (_Dames de la Halle_) deliver\r\n      congratulatory harangues; present “bouquets to the Shrine of\r\n      Sainte Genevieve.” Unenrolled men deposit their arms,—not so\r\n      readily as could be wished; and receive “nine francs.” With _Te\r\n      Deums_, Royal Visits, and sanctioned Revolution, there is halcyon\r\n      weather; weather even of preternatural brightness; the hurricane\r\n      being overblown.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, as is natural, the waves still run high, hollow\r\n      rocks retaining their murmur. We are but at the 22nd of the\r\n      month, hardly above a week since the Bastille fell, when it\r\n      suddenly appears that old Foulon is alive; nay, that he is here,\r\n      in early morning, in the streets of Paris; the extortioner, the\r\n      plotter, who would make the people eat grass, and was a liar from\r\n      the beginning!—It is even so. The deceptive “sumptuous funeral”\r\n      (of some domestic that died); the hiding-place at Vitry towards\r\n      Fontainbleau, have not availed that wretched old man. Some living\r\n      domestic or dependant, for none loves Foulon, has betrayed him to\r\n      the Village. Merciless boors of Vitry unearth him; pounce on him,\r\n      like hell-hounds: Westward, old Infamy; to Paris, to be judged at\r\n      the Hôtel-de-Ville! His old head, which seventy-four years have\r\n      bleached, is bare; they have tied an emblematic bundle of grass\r\n      on his back; a garland of nettles and thistles is round his neck:\r\n      in this manner; led with ropes; goaded on with curses and\r\n      menaces, must he, with his old limbs, sprawl forward; the\r\n      pitiablest, most unpitied of all old men.\r\n\r\n      Sooty Saint-Antoine, and every street, mustering its crowds as he\r\n      passes,—the Place de Grève, the Hall of the Hôtel-de-Ville will\r\n      scarcely hold his escort and him. Foulon must not only be judged\r\n      righteously; but judged there where he stands, without any delay.\r\n      Appoint seven judges, ye Municipals, or seventy-and-seven; name\r\n      them yourselves, or we will name them: but judge him![193]\r\n      Electoral rhetoric, eloquence of Mayor Bailly, is wasted\r\n      explaining the beauty of the Law’s delay. Delay, and still delay!\r\n      Behold, O Mayor of the People, the morning has worn itself into\r\n      noon; and he is still unjudged!—Lafayette, pressingly sent for,\r\n      arrives; gives voice: This Foulon, a known man, is guilty almost\r\n      beyond doubt; but may he not have accomplices? Ought not the\r\n      truth to be cunningly pumped out of him,—in the Abbaye Prison? It\r\n      is a new light! Sansculottism claps hands;—at which\r\n      hand-clapping, Foulon (in his fainness, as his Destiny would have\r\n      it) also claps. ‘See! they understand one another!’ cries dark\r\n      Sansculottism, blazing into fury of suspicion.—‘Friends,’ said “a\r\n      person in good clothes,” stepping forward, ‘what is the use of\r\n      judging this man? Has he not been judged these thirty years?’\r\n      With wild yells, Sansculottism clutches him, in its hundred\r\n      hands: he is whirled across the Place de Grève, to the\r\n      “_Lanterne_,” Lamp-iron which there is at the corner of the _Rue\r\n      de la Vannerie;_ pleading bitterly for life,—to the deaf winds.\r\n      Only with the third rope (for two ropes broke, and the quavering\r\n      voice still pleaded), can he be so much as got hanged! His Body\r\n      is dragged through the streets; his Head goes aloft on a pike,\r\n      the mouth filled with grass: amid sounds as of Tophet, from a\r\n      grass-eating people.[194]\r\n\r\n      Surely if Revenge is a “kind of Justice,” it is a “wild” kind! O\r\n      mad Sansculottism hast thou risen, in thy mad darkness, in thy\r\n      soot and rags; unexpectedly, like an Enceladus, living-buried,\r\n      from under his Trinacria? They that would make grass be eaten do\r\n      now eat grass, in _this_ manner? After long dumb-groaning\r\n      generations, has the turn suddenly become thine?—To such abysmal\r\n      overturns, and frightful instantaneous inversions of the\r\n      centre-of-gravity, are human Solecisms all liable, if they but\r\n      knew it; the more liable, the falser (and topheavier) they are!—\r\n\r\n      To add to the horror of Mayor Bailly and his Municipals, word\r\n      comes that Berthier has also been arrested; that he is on his way\r\n      hither from Compiègne. Berthier, Intendant (say, _Tax-levier_) of\r\n      Paris; sycophant and tyrant; forestaller of Corn; contriver of\r\n      Camps against the people;—accused of many things: is he not\r\n      Foulon’s son-in-law; and, in that one point, guilty of all? In\r\n      these hours too, when Sansculottism has its blood up! The\r\n      shuddering Municipals send one of their number to escort him,\r\n      with mounted National Guards.\r\n\r\n      At the fall of day, the wretched Berthier, still wearing a face\r\n      of courage, arrives at the Barrier; in an open carriage; with the\r\n      Municipal beside him; five hundred horsemen with drawn sabres;\r\n      unarmed footmen enough, not without noise! Placards go brandished\r\n      round him; bearing legibly his indictment, as Sansculottism, with\r\n      unlegal brevity, “in huge letters,” draws it up.[195] Paris is\r\n      come forth to meet him: with hand-clappings, with windows flung\r\n      up; with dances, triumph-songs, as of the Furies! Lastly the Head\r\n      of Foulon: this also meets him on a pike. Well might his “look\r\n      become glazed,” and sense fail him, at such sight!—Nevertheless,\r\n      be the man’s conscience what it may, his nerves are of iron. At\r\n      the Hôtel-de-Ville, he will answer nothing. He says, he obeyed\r\n      superior order; they have his papers; they may judge and\r\n      determine: as for himself, not having closed an eye these two\r\n      nights, he demands, before all things, to have sleep. Leaden\r\n      sleep, thou miserable Berthier! Guards rise with him, in motion\r\n      towards the Abbaye. At the very door of the Hôtel-de-Ville, they\r\n      are clutched; flung asunder, as by a vortex of mad arms; Berthier\r\n      whirls towards the Lanterne. He snatches a musket; fells and\r\n      strikes, defending himself like a mad lion; is borne down,\r\n      trampled, hanged, mangled: his Head too, and even his Heart,\r\n      flies over the City on a pike.\r\n\r\n      Horrible, in Lands that had known equal justice! Not so unnatural\r\n      in Lands that had never known it. _Le sang qui coule est-il donc\r\n      si pure?_ asks Barnave; intimating that the Gallows, though by\r\n      irregular methods, has its own.—Thou thyself, O Reader, when thou\r\n      turnest that corner of the Rue de la Vannerie, and discernest\r\n      still that same grim Bracket of old Iron, wilt not want for\r\n      reflections. “Over a grocer’s shop,” or otherwise; with “a bust\r\n      of Louis XIV. in the niche under it,” or now no longer in the\r\n      niche,—_it_ still sticks there: still holding out an ineffectual\r\n      light, of fish-oil; and has seen worlds wrecked, and says\r\n      nothing.\r\n\r\n      But to the eye of enlightened Patriotism, what a thunder-cloud\r\n      was this; suddenly shaping itself in the radiance of the halcyon\r\n      weather! Cloud of Erebus blackness: betokening latent electricity\r\n      without limit. Mayor Bailly, General Lafayette throw up their\r\n      commissions, in an indignant manner;—need to be flattered back\r\n      again. The cloud disappears, as thunder-clouds do. The halcyon\r\n      weather returns, though of a grayer complexion; of a character\r\n      more and more evidently _not_ supernatural.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in any case, with what rubs soever, shall the Bastille be\r\n      abolished from our Earth; and with it, Feudalism, Despotism; and,\r\n      one hopes, Scoundrelism generally, and all hard usage of man by\r\n      his brother man. Alas, the Scoundrelism and hard usage are not so\r\n      easy of abolition! But as for the Bastille, it sinks day after\r\n      day, and month after month; its ashlars and boulders tumbling\r\n      down continually, by express order of our Municipals. Crowds of\r\n      the curious roam through its caverns; gaze on the skeletons found\r\n      walled up, on the _oubliettes_, iron cages, monstrous\r\n      stone-blocks with padlock chains. One day we discern Mirabeau\r\n      there; along with the Genevese Dumont.[196] Workers and onlookers\r\n      make reverent way for him; fling verses, flowers on his path,\r\n      Bastille-papers and curiosities into his carriage, with _vivats._\r\n\r\n      Able Editors compile Books from the _Bastille Archives;_ from\r\n      what of them remain unburnt. The Key of that Robber-Den shall\r\n      cross the Atlantic; shall lie on Washington’s hall-table. The\r\n      great Clock ticks now in a private patriotic Clockmaker’s\r\n      apartment; no longer measuring hours of mere heaviness. Vanished\r\n      is the Bastille, what we call vanished: the _body_, or\r\n      sandstones, of it hanging, in benign metamorphosis, for centuries\r\n      to come, over the Seine waters, as _Pont Louis Seize_;[197] the\r\n      soul of it living, perhaps still longer, in the memories of men.\r\n\r\n      So far, ye august Senators, with your Tennis-Court Oaths, your\r\n      inertia and impetus, your sagacity and pertinacity, have ye\r\n      brought us. ‘And yet think, Messieurs,’ as the Petitioner justly\r\n      urged, ‘you who were our saviours, did yourselves need\r\n      saviours,’—the brave Bastillers, namely; workmen of Paris; many\r\n      of them in straightened pecuniary circumstances! [198]\r\n      Subscriptions are opened; Lists are formed, more accurate than\r\n      Elie’s; harangues are delivered. A Body of _Bastille Heroes_,\r\n      tolerably complete, did get together;—comparable to the\r\n      Argonauts; hoping to endure like them. But in little more than a\r\n      year, the whirlpool of things threw them asunder again, and they\r\n      sank. So many highest superlatives achieved by man are followed\r\n      by new higher; and dwindle into comparatives and positives! The\r\n      Siege of the Bastille, weighed with which, in the Historical\r\n      balance, most other sieges, including that of Troy Town, are\r\n      gossamer, cost, as we find, in killed and mortally wounded, on\r\n      the part of the Besiegers, some Eighty-three persons: on the part\r\n      of the Besieged, after all that straw-burning, fire-pumping, and\r\n      deluge of musketry, One poor solitary invalid, shot stone-dead\r\n      (_roide-mort_) on the battlements;[199] The Bastille Fortress,\r\n      like the City of Jericho, was overturned by miraculous _sound._\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK VI.\r\n      CONSOLIDATION\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.6.I.\r\n      Make the Constitution.\r\n\r\n      Here perhaps is the place to fix, a little more precisely, what\r\n      these two words, _French Revolution_, shall mean; for, strictly\r\n      considered, they may have as many meanings as there are speakers\r\n      of them. All things are in revolution; in change from moment to\r\n      moment, which becomes sensible from epoch to epoch: in this\r\n      Time-World of ours there is properly nothing else but revolution\r\n      and mutation, and even nothing else conceivable. Revolution, you\r\n      answer, means _speedier_ change. Whereupon one has still to ask:\r\n      How speedy? At what degree of speed; in what particular points of\r\n      this variable course, which varies in velocity, but can never\r\n      stop till Time itself stops, does revolution begin and end; cease\r\n      to be ordinary mutation, and again become such? It is a thing\r\n      that will depend on definition more or less arbitrary.\r\n\r\n      For ourselves we answer that French Revolution means here the\r\n      open violent Rebellion, and Victory, of disimprisoned Anarchy\r\n      against corrupt worn-out Authority: how Anarchy breaks prison;\r\n      bursts up from the infinite Deep, and rages uncontrollable,\r\n      immeasurable, enveloping a world; in phasis after phasis of\r\n      fever-frenzy;—till the frenzy burning itself out, and what\r\n      elements of new Order it held (since all Force holds such)\r\n      developing themselves, the Uncontrollable be got, if not\r\n      reimprisoned, yet harnessed, and its mad forces made to work\r\n      towards their object as sane regulated ones. For as Hierarchies\r\n      and Dynasties of all kinds, Theocracies, Aristocracies,\r\n      Autocracies, Strumpetocracies, have ruled over the world; so it\r\n      was appointed, in the decrees of Providence, that this same\r\n      Victorious Anarchy, Jacobinism, Sansculottism, French Revolution,\r\n      Horrors of French Revolution, or what else mortals name it,\r\n      should have its turn. The “destructive wrath” of Sansculottism:\r\n      this is what we speak, having unhappily no voice for singing.\r\n\r\n      Surely a great Phenomenon: nay it is a _transcendental_ one,\r\n      overstepping all rules and experience; the crowning Phenomenon of\r\n      our Modern Time. For here again, most unexpectedly, comes antique\r\n      Fanaticism in new and newest vesture; miraculous, as all\r\n      Fanaticism is. Call it the Fanaticism of “making away with\r\n      formulas, _de humer les formules_.” The world of formulas, the\r\n      _formed_ regulated world, which all habitable world is,—must\r\n      needs hate such Fanaticism like death; and be at deadly variance\r\n      with it. The world of formulas must conquer it; or failing that,\r\n      must die execrating it, anathematising it;—can nevertheless in\r\n      nowise prevent its being and its having been. The Anathemas are\r\n      there, and the miraculous Thing is there.\r\n\r\n      Whence it cometh? Whither it goeth? These are questions! When the\r\n      age of Miracles lay faded into the distance as an incredible\r\n      tradition, and even the age of Conventionalities was now old; and\r\n      Man’s Existence had for long generations rested on mere formulas\r\n      which were grown hollow by course of time; and it seemed as if no\r\n      Reality any longer existed but only Phantasms of realities, and\r\n      God’s Universe were the work of the Tailor and Upholsterer\r\n      mainly, and men were buckram masks that went about becking and\r\n      grimacing there,—on a sudden, the Earth yawns asunder, and amid\r\n      Tartarean smoke, and glare of fierce brightness, rises\r\n      SANSCULOTTISM, many-headed, fire-breathing, and asks: What think\r\n      ye of _me?_ Well may the buckram masks start together,\r\n      terror-struck; “into expressive well-concerted groups!” It is\r\n      indeed, Friends, a most singular, most fatal thing. Let whosoever\r\n      is but buckram and a phantasm look to it: ill verily may it fare\r\n      with him; here methinks he cannot much longer be. Wo also to many\r\n      a one who is not wholly buckram, but partially real and human!\r\n      The age of Miracles has come back! “Behold the World-Phoenix, in\r\n      fire-consummation and fire-creation; wide are her fanning wings;\r\n      loud is her death-melody, of battle-thunders and falling towns;\r\n      skyward lashes the funeral flame, enveloping all things: it is\r\n      the Death-Birth of a World!”\r\n\r\n      Whereby, however, as we often say, shall one unspeakable blessing\r\n      seem attainable. This, namely: that Man and his Life rest no more\r\n      on hollowness and a Lie, but on solidity and some kind of Truth.\r\n      Welcome, the beggarliest truth, so it _be_ one, in exchange for\r\n      the royallest sham! Truth of any kind breeds ever new and better\r\n      truth; thus hard granite rock will crumble down into soil, under\r\n      the blessed skyey influences; and cover itself with verdure, with\r\n      fruitage and umbrage. But as for Falsehood, which in like\r\n      contrary manner, grows ever falser,—what can it, or what should\r\n      it do but decease, being ripe; decompose itself, gently or even\r\n      violently, and return to the Father of it,—too probably in flames\r\n      of fire?\r\n\r\n      Sansculottism will burn much; but what is incombustible it will\r\n      not burn. Fear not Sansculottism; recognise it for what it is,\r\n      the portentous, inevitable end of much, the miraculous beginning\r\n      of much. One other thing thou mayest understand of it: that it\r\n      too came from God; for has it not _been?_ From of old, as it is\r\n      written, are His goings forth; in the great Deep of things;\r\n      fearful and wonderful now as in the beginning: in the whirlwind\r\n      also He speaks! and the wrath of men is made to praise Him.—But\r\n      to gauge and measure this immeasurable Thing, and what is called\r\n      _account for it_, and reduce it to a dead logic-formula, attempt\r\n      not! Much less shalt thou shriek thyself hoarse, cursing it; for\r\n      that, to all needful lengths, has been already done. As an\r\n      actually existing Son of Time, _look_, with unspeakable manifold\r\n      interest, oftenest in silence, at what the Time did bring:\r\n      therewith edify, instruct, nourish thyself, or were it but to\r\n      amuse and gratify thyself, as it is given thee.\r\n\r\n      Another question which at every new turn will rise on us,\r\n      requiring ever new reply is this: Where the French Revolution\r\n      specially _is?_ In the King’s Palace, in his Majesty’s or her\r\n      Majesty’s managements, and maltreatments, cabals, imbecilities\r\n      and woes, answer some few:—whom we do not answer. In the National\r\n      Assembly, answer a large mixed multitude: who accordingly seat\r\n      themselves in the Reporter’s Chair; and therefrom noting what\r\n      Proclamations, Acts, Reports, passages of logic-fence, bursts of\r\n      parliamentary eloquence seem notable within doors, and what\r\n      tumults and rumours of tumult become audible from\r\n      without,—produce volume on volume; and, naming it History of the\r\n      French Revolution, contentedly publish the same. To do the like,\r\n      to almost any extent, with so many Filed Newspapers, _Choix des\r\n      Rapports, Histoires Parlementaires_ as there are, amounting to\r\n      many horseloads, were easy for us. Easy but unprofitable. The\r\n      National Assembly, named now Constituent Assembly, goes its\r\n      course; making the Constitution; but the French Revolution also\r\n      goes _its_ course.\r\n\r\n      In general, may we not say that the French Revolution lies in the\r\n      heart and head of every violent-speaking, of every\r\n      violent-thinking French Man? How the Twenty-five Millions of\r\n      such, in their perplexed combination, acting and counter-acting\r\n      may give birth to events; which event successively is the\r\n      cardinal one; and from what point of vision it may best be\r\n      surveyed: this is a problem. Which problem the best insight,\r\n      seeking light from all possible sources, shifting its point of\r\n      vision whithersoever vision or glimpse of vision can be had, may\r\n      employ itself in solving; and be well content to solve in some\r\n      tolerably approximate way.\r\n\r\n      As to the National Assembly, in so far as it still towers eminent\r\n      over France, after the manner of a car-borne _Carroccio_, though\r\n      now no longer in the van; and rings signals for retreat or for\r\n      advance,—it is and continues a reality among other realities. But\r\n      in so far as it sits making the Constitution, on the other hand,\r\n      it is a fatuity and chimera mainly. Alas, in the never so heroic\r\n      building of Montesquieu-Mably card-castles, though shouted over\r\n      by the world, what interest is there? Occupied in that way, an\r\n      august National Assembly becomes for us little other than a\r\n      Sanhedrim of pedants, not of the gerund-grinding, yet of no\r\n      fruitfuller sort; and its loud debatings and recriminations about\r\n      Rights of Man, Right of Peace and War, _Veto suspensif, Veto\r\n      absolu_, what are they but so many Pedant’s-curses, “May God\r\n      confound you for your _Theory of Irregular Verbs!_”\r\n\r\n      A Constitution can be built, Constitutions enough _à la Sieyes:_\r\n      but the frightful difficulty is that of getting men to come and\r\n      live in them! Could Sieyes have drawn thunder and lightning out\r\n      of Heaven to sanction his Constitution, it had been well: but\r\n      without any thunder? Nay, strictly considered, is it not still\r\n      true that without some such celestial sanction, given visibly in\r\n      thunder or invisibly otherwise, no Constitution can in the long\r\n      run be worth much more than the waste-paper it is written on? The\r\n      Constitution, the set of Laws, or prescribed Habits of Acting,\r\n      that men will live under, is the one which images their\r\n      Convictions,—their Faith as to this wondrous Universe, and what\r\n      rights, duties, capabilities they have there; which stands\r\n      sanctioned therefore, by Necessity itself, if not by a seen\r\n      Deity, then by an unseen one. Other laws, whereof there are\r\n      always enough _ready_-made, are usurpations; which men do not\r\n      obey, but rebel against, and abolish, by their earliest\r\n      convenience.\r\n\r\n      The question of questions accordingly were, Who is it that\r\n      especially for rebellers and abolishers, can make a Constitution?\r\n      He that can image forth the general Belief when there is one;\r\n      that can impart one when, as here, there is none. A most rare\r\n      man; ever as of old a god-missioned man! Here, however, in defect\r\n      of such transcendent supreme man, Time with its infinite\r\n      succession of merely superior men, each yielding his little\r\n      contribution, does much. Force likewise (for, as Antiquarian\r\n      Philosophers teach, the royal Sceptre was from the first\r\n      something of a Hammer, to _crack_ such heads as could not be\r\n      convinced) will all along find somewhat to do. And thus in\r\n      perpetual abolition and reparation, rending and mending, with\r\n      struggle and strife, with present evil and the hope and effort\r\n      towards future good, must the Constitution, as all human things\r\n      do, build itself forward; or unbuild itself, and sink, as it can\r\n      and may. O Sieyes, and ye other Committeemen, and Twelve Hundred\r\n      miscellaneous individuals from all parts of France! What is the\r\n      Belief of France, and yours, if ye knew it? Properly that there\r\n      shall be no Belief; that all formulas be swallowed. The\r\n      Constitution which will suit that? Alas, too clearly, a\r\n      No-Constitution, an Anarchy;—which also, in due season, shall be\r\n      vouchsafed you.\r\n\r\n      But, after all, what can an unfortunate National Assembly do?\r\n      Consider only this, that there are Twelve Hundred miscellaneous\r\n      individuals; not a unit of whom but has his own\r\n      thinking-apparatus, his own speaking-apparatus! In every unit of\r\n      them is some belief and wish, different for each, both that\r\n      France should be regenerated, and also that he individually\r\n      should do it. Twelve Hundred separate Forces, yoked\r\n      miscellaneously to any object, miscellaneously to all sides of\r\n      it; and bid pull for life!\r\n\r\n      Or is it the nature of National Assemblies generally to do, with\r\n      endless labour and clangour, Nothing? Are Representative\r\n      Governments mostly at bottom Tyrannies too! Shall we say, the\r\n      _Tyrants_, the ambitious contentious Persons, from all corners of\r\n      the country do, in this manner, get gathered into one place; and\r\n      there, with motion and counter-motion, with jargon and hubbub,\r\n      _cancel_ one another, like the fabulous Kilkenny Cats; and\r\n      produce, for net-result, _zero;_—the country meanwhile\r\n      _governing_ or guiding _itself_, by such wisdom, recognised or\r\n      for most part unrecognised, as may exist in individual heads here\r\n      and there?—Nay, even that were a great improvement: for, of old,\r\n      with their Guelf Factions and Ghibelline Factions, with their Red\r\n      Roses and White Roses, they were wont to cancel the whole country\r\n      as well. Besides they do it now in a much narrower cockpit;\r\n      within the four walls of their Assembly House, and here and there\r\n      an outpost of Hustings and Barrel-heads; do it with tongues too,\r\n      not with swords:—all which improvements, in the art of producing\r\n      zero, are they not great? Nay, best of all, some happy Continents\r\n      (as the Western one, with its Savannahs, where whosoever has four\r\n      willing limbs finds food under his feet, and an infinite sky over\r\n      his head) can do without governing.—What Sphinx-questions; which\r\n      the distracted world, in these very generations, must answer or\r\n      die!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.6.II.\r\n      The Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n      One thing an elected Assembly of Twelve Hundred is fit for:\r\n      Destroying. Which indeed is but a more decided exercise of its\r\n      natural talent for Doing Nothing. Do nothing, only keep\r\n      agitating, debating; and things will destroy themselves.\r\n\r\n      So and not otherwise proved it with an august National Assembly.\r\n      It took the name, Constituent, as if its mission and function had\r\n      been to construct or build; which also, with its whole soul, it\r\n      endeavoured to do: yet, in the fates, in the nature of things,\r\n      there lay for it precisely of all functions the most opposite to\r\n      that. Singular, what Gospels men will believe; even Gospels\r\n      according to Jean Jacques! It was the fixed Faith of these\r\n      National Deputies, as of all thinking Frenchmen, that the\r\n      Constitution could be _made;_ that they, there and then, were\r\n      called to make it. How, with the toughness of Old Hebrews or\r\n      Ishmaelite Moslem, did the otherwise light unbelieving People\r\n      persist in this their _Credo quia impossibile;_ and front the\r\n      armed world with it; and grow fanatic, and even heroic, and do\r\n      exploits by it! The Constituent Assembly’s Constitution, and\r\n      several others, will, being printed and not manuscript, survive\r\n      to future generations, as an instructive well-nigh incredible\r\n      document of the Time: the most significant Picture of the then\r\n      existing France; or at lowest, Picture of these men’s Picture of\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      But in truth and seriousness, what could the National Assembly\r\n      have done? The thing to _be_ done was, actually as they said, to\r\n      regenerate France; to abolish the old France, and make a new one;\r\n      quietly or forcibly, by concession or by violence, this, by the\r\n      Law of Nature, has become inevitable. With what degree of\r\n      violence, depends on the wisdom of those that preside over it.\r\n      With perfect wisdom on the part of the National Assembly, it had\r\n      all been otherwise; but whether, in any wise, it could have been\r\n      pacific, nay other than bloody and convulsive, may still be a\r\n      question.\r\n\r\n      Grant, meanwhile, that this Constituent Assembly does to the last\r\n      continue to be something. With a sigh, it sees itself incessantly\r\n      forced away from its infinite divine task, of perfecting “the\r\n      Theory of Irregular Verbs,”—to finite terrestrial tasks, which\r\n      latter have still a significance for us. It is the cynosure of\r\n      revolutionary France, this National Assembly. All work of\r\n      Government has fallen into its hands, or under its control; all\r\n      men look to it for guidance. In the middle of that huge Revolt of\r\n      Twenty-five millions, it hovers always aloft as _Carroccio_ or\r\n      Battle-Standard, impelling and impelled, in the most confused\r\n      way; if it cannot give much guidance, it will still seem to give\r\n      some. It emits pacificatory Proclamations, not a few; with more\r\n      or with less result. It authorises the enrolment of National\r\n      Guards,—lest Brigands come to devour us, and reap the unripe\r\n      crops. It sends missions to quell “effervescences;” to deliver\r\n      men from the Lanterne. It can listen to congratulatory Addresses,\r\n      which arrive daily by the sackful; mostly in King Cambyses’ vein:\r\n      also to Petitions and complaints from all mortals; so that every\r\n      mortal’s complaint, if it cannot get redressed, may at least hear\r\n      itself complain. For the rest, an august National Assembly can\r\n      produce Parliamentary Eloquence; and appoint Committees.\r\n      Committees of the Constitution, of Reports, of Researches; and of\r\n      much else: which again yield mountains of Printed Paper; the\r\n      theme of new Parliamentary Eloquence, in bursts, or in plenteous\r\n      smooth-flowing floods. And so, from the waste vortex whereon all\r\n      things go whirling and grinding, Organic Laws, or the similitude\r\n      of such, slowly emerge.\r\n\r\n      With endless debating, we get the _Rights of Man_ written down\r\n      and promulgated: true paper basis of all paper Constitutions.\r\n      Neglecting, cry the opponents, to declare the Duties of Man!\r\n      Forgetting, answer we, to ascertain the _Mights_ of Man;—one of\r\n      the fatalest omissions!—Nay, sometimes, as on the Fourth of\r\n      August, our National Assembly, fired suddenly by an almost\r\n      preternatural enthusiasm, will get through whole masses of work\r\n      in one night. A memorable night, this Fourth of August:\r\n      Dignitaries temporal and spiritual; Peers, Archbishops,\r\n      Parlement-Presidents, each outdoing the other in patriotic\r\n      devotedness, come successively to throw their (untenable)\r\n      possessions on the “altar of the fatherland.” With louder and\r\n      louder vivats, for indeed it is “after dinner” too,—they abolish\r\n      Tithes, Seignorial Dues, Gabelle, excessive Preservation of Game;\r\n      nay Privilege, Immunity, Feudalism root and branch; then appoint\r\n      a _Te Deum_ for it; and so, finally, disperse about three in the\r\n      morning, striking the stars with their sublime heads. Such night,\r\n      unforeseen but for ever memorable, was this of the Fourth of\r\n      August 1789. Miraculous, or semi-miraculous, some seem to think\r\n      it. A new Night of Pentecost, shall we say, shaped according to\r\n      the new Time, and new Church of Jean Jacques Rousseau? It had its\r\n      causes; also its effects.\r\n\r\n      In such manner labour the National Deputies; perfecting their\r\n      Theory of Irregular Verbs; governing France, and being governed\r\n      by it; with toil and noise;—cutting asunder ancient intolerable\r\n      bonds; and, for new ones, assiduously spinning ropes of sand.\r\n      Were their labours a nothing or a something, yet the eyes of all\r\n      France being reverently fixed on them, History can never very\r\n      long leave them altogether out of sight.\r\n\r\n      For the present, if we glance into that Assembly Hall of theirs,\r\n      it will be found, as is natural, “most irregular.” As many as “a\r\n      hundred members are on their feet at once;” no rule in making\r\n      motions, or only commencements of a rule; Spectators’ Gallery\r\n      allowed to applaud, and even to hiss;[200] President, appointed\r\n      once a fortnight, raising many times no serene head above the\r\n      waves. Nevertheless, as in all human Assemblages, like does begin\r\n      arranging itself to like; the perennial rule, _Ubi homines sunt\r\n      modi sunt_, proves valid. Rudiments of Methods disclose\r\n      themselves; rudiments of Parties. There is a Right Side (_Côté\r\n      Droit_), a Left Side (_Côté Gauche_); sitting on M. le\r\n      President’s right hand, or on his left: the _Côté Droit_\r\n      conservative; the _Côté Gauche_ destructive. Intermediate is\r\n      Anglomaniac Constitutionalism, or Two-Chamber Royalism; with its\r\n      Mouniers, its Lallys,—fast verging towards nonentity. Preeminent,\r\n      on the Right Side, pleads and perorates Cazalès, the\r\n      Dragoon-captain, eloquent, mildly fervent; earning for himself\r\n      the shadow of a name. There also blusters Barrel-Mirabeau, the\r\n      Younger Mirabeau, not without wit: dusky d’Espréménil does\r\n      nothing but sniff and ejaculate; _might_, it is fondly thought,\r\n      lay prostrate the Elder Mirabeau himself, would he but\r\n      try,[201]—which he does not. Last and greatest, see, for one\r\n      moment, the Abbé Maury; with his jesuitic eyes, his impassive\r\n      brass face, “image of all the cardinal sins.” Indomitable,\r\n      unquenchable, he fights jesuitico-rhetorically; with toughest\r\n      lungs and heart; for Throne, especially for Altar and Tithes. So\r\n      that a shrill voice exclaims once, from the Gallery: ‘Messieurs\r\n      of the Clergy, you _have_ to be shaved; if you wriggle too much,\r\n      you will get cut.’[202]\r\n\r\n      The Left side is also called the d’Orléans side; and sometimes\r\n      derisively, the Palais Royal. And yet, so confused,\r\n      real-imaginary seems everything, “it is doubtful,” as Mirabeau\r\n      said, “whether d’Orléans himself belong to that same d’Orléans\r\n      Party.” What can be known and seen is, that his moon-visage does\r\n      beam forth from that point of space. There likewise sits seagreen\r\n      Robespierre; throwing in his light weight, with decision, not yet\r\n      with effect. A thin lean Puritan and Precisian; he would make\r\n      away with formulas; yet lives, moves, and has his being, wholly\r\n      in formulas, of another sort. “_Peuple_,” such according to\r\n      Robespierre ought to be the Royal method of promulgating laws,\r\n      “_Peuple_, this is the Law I have framed for thee; dost thou\r\n      accept it?”—answered from Right Side, from Centre and Left, by\r\n      inextinguishable laughter.[203] Yet men of insight discern that\r\n      the Seagreen may by chance go far: ‘this man,’ observes Mirabeau,\r\n      ‘will do somewhat; he believes every word he says.’\r\n\r\n      Abbé Sieyes is busy with mere Constitutional work: wherein,\r\n      unluckily, fellow-workmen are less pliable than, with one who has\r\n      completed the Science of Polity, they ought to be. Courage,\r\n      Sieyes nevertheless! Some twenty months of heroic travail, of\r\n      contradiction from the stupid, and the Constitution shall be\r\n      built; the top-stone of it brought out with shouting,—say rather,\r\n      the top-paper, for it is all Paper; and _thou_ hast done in it\r\n      what the Earth or the Heaven could require, thy utmost. Note\r\n      likewise this Trio; memorable for several things; memorable were\r\n      it only that their history is written in an epigram: “whatsoever\r\n      these Three have in hand,” it is said, “Duport thinks it, Barnave\r\n      speaks it, Lameth does it.”[204]\r\n\r\n      But royal Mirabeau? Conspicuous among all parties, raised above\r\n      and beyond them all, this man rises more and more. As we often\r\n      say, he has an _eye_, he is a reality; while others are formulas\r\n      and _eye_-glasses. In the Transient he will detect the Perennial,\r\n      find some firm footing even among Paper-vortexes. His fame is\r\n      gone forth to all lands; it gladdened the heart of the crabbed\r\n      old Friend of Men himself before he died. The very Postilions of\r\n      inns have heard of Mirabeau: when an impatient Traveller\r\n      complains that the team is insufficient, his Postilion answers,\r\n      ‘Yes, Monsieur, the wheelers are weak; but my _mirabeau_ (main\r\n      horse), you see, is a right one, _mais mon mirabeau est\r\n      excellent_.’[205]\r\n\r\n      And now, Reader, thou shalt quit this noisy Discrepancy of a\r\n      National Assembly; not (if thou be of humane mind) without pity.\r\n      Twelve Hundred brother men are there, in the centre of\r\n      Twenty-five Millions; fighting so fiercely with Fate and with one\r\n      another; struggling their lives out, as most sons of Adam do, for\r\n      that which profiteth not. Nay, on the whole, it is admitted\r\n      further to be very _dull_. ‘Dull as this day’s Assembly,’ said\r\n      some one. ‘Why date, _Pourquoi dater?_’ answered Mirabeau.\r\n\r\n      Consider that they are Twelve Hundred; that they not only speak,\r\n      but _read_ their speeches; and even borrow and steal speeches to\r\n      read! With Twelve Hundred fluent speakers, and their Noah’s\r\n      Deluge of vociferous commonplace, unattainable silence may well\r\n      seem the one blessing of Life. But figure Twelve Hundred\r\n      pamphleteers; droning forth perpetual pamphlets: and no man to\r\n      gag them! Neither, as in the American Congress, do the\r\n      arrangements seem perfect. A Senator has not his own Desk and\r\n      Newspaper here; of Tobacco (much less of Pipes) there is not the\r\n      slightest provision. Conversation itself must be transacted in a\r\n      low tone, with continual interruption: only “pencil Notes”\r\n      circulate freely; “in incredible numbers to the foot of the very\r\n      tribune.”[206]—Such work is it, regenerating a Nation; perfecting\r\n      one’s Theory of Irregular Verbs!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.6.III.\r\n      The General Overturn.\r\n\r\n      Of the King’s Court, for the present, there is almost nothing\r\n      whatever to be said. Silent, deserted are these halls; Royalty\r\n      languishes forsaken of its war-god and all its hopes, till once\r\n      the Œil-de-Bœuf rally again. The sceptre is departed from King\r\n      Louis; is gone over to the _Salles des Menus_, to the Paris\r\n      Townhall, or one knows not whither. In the July days, while all\r\n      ears were yet deafened by the crash of the Bastille, and\r\n      Ministers and Princes were scattered to the four winds, it seemed\r\n      as if the very Valets had grown heavy of hearing. Besenval, also\r\n      in flight towards Infinite Space, but hovering a little at\r\n      Versailles, was addressing his Majesty personally for an Order\r\n      about post-horses; when, lo, “the Valet in waiting places himself\r\n      familiarly between his Majesty and me,” stretching out his rascal\r\n      neck to learn what it was! His Majesty, in sudden choler, whirled\r\n      round; made a clutch at the tongs: “I gently prevented him; he\r\n      grasped my hand in thankfulness; and I noticed tears in his\r\n      eyes.”[207]\r\n\r\n      Poor King; for French Kings also are men! Louis Fourteenth\r\n      himself once clutched the tongs, and even smote with them; but\r\n      then it was at Louvois, and Dame Maintenon ran up.—The Queen sits\r\n      weeping in her inner apartments, surrounded by weak women: she is\r\n      “at the height of unpopularity;” universally regarded as the evil\r\n      genius of France. Her friends and familiar counsellors have all\r\n      fled; and fled, surely, on the foolishest errand. The Château\r\n      Polignac still frowns aloft, on its “bold and enormous” cubical\r\n      rock, amid the blooming champaigns, amid the blue girdling\r\n      mountains of Auvergne:[208] but no Duke and Duchess Polignac look\r\n      forth from it; they have fled, they have “met Necker at Bale;”\r\n      they shall not return. That France should see her Nobles resist\r\n      the Irresistible, Inevitable, with the face of angry men, was\r\n      unhappy, not unexpected: but with the face and sense of pettish\r\n      children? This was her peculiarity. They understood nothing;\r\n      would understand nothing. Does not, at this hour, a new Polignac,\r\n      first-born of these Two, sit reflective in the Castle of\r\n      Ham;[209] in an astonishment he will never recover from; the most\r\n      confused of existing mortals?\r\n\r\n      King Louis has his new Ministry: mere Popularities; Old-President\r\n      Pompignan; Necker, coming back in triumph; and other such.[210]\r\n      But what will it avail him? As was said, the sceptre, all but the\r\n      wooden gilt sceptre, has departed elsewhither. Volition,\r\n      determination is not in this man: only innocence, indolence;\r\n      dependence on all persons but himself, on all circumstances but\r\n      the circumstances he were lord of. So troublous internally is our\r\n      Versailles and its work. Beautiful, if seen from afar,\r\n      resplendent like a Sun; seen near at hand, a mere\r\n      Sun’s-Atmosphere, hiding darkness, confused ferment of ruin!\r\n\r\n      But over France, there goes on the indisputablest “destruction of\r\n      formulas;” transaction of realities that follow therefrom. So\r\n      many millions of persons, all gyved, and nigh strangled, with\r\n      formulas; whose Life nevertheless, at least the digestion and\r\n      hunger of it, was real enough! Heaven has at length sent an\r\n      abundant harvest; but what profits it the poor man, when Earth\r\n      with her formulas interposes? Industry, in these times of\r\n      Insurrection, must needs lie dormant; capital, as usual, not\r\n      circulating, but stagnating timorously in nooks. The poor man is\r\n      short of work, is therefore short of money; nay even had he\r\n      money, bread is not to be bought for it. Were it plotting of\r\n      Aristocrats, plotting of d’Orléans; were it Brigands,\r\n      preternatural terror, and the clang of Phoebus Apollo’s silver\r\n      bow,—enough, the markets are scarce of grain, plentiful only in\r\n      tumult. Farmers seem lazy to thresh;—being either “bribed;” or\r\n      needing no bribe, with prices ever rising, with perhaps rent\r\n      itself no longer so pressing. Neither, what is singular, do\r\n      municipal enactments, “That along with so many measures of wheat\r\n      you shall sell so many of rye,” and other the like, much mend the\r\n      matter. Dragoons with drawn swords stand ranked among the\r\n      corn-sacks, often more dragoons than sacks.[211] Meal-mobs\r\n      abound; growing into mobs of a still darker quality.\r\n\r\n      Starvation has been known among the French Commonalty before\r\n      this; known and familiar. Did we not see them, in the year 1775,\r\n      presenting, in sallow faces, in wretchedness and raggedness,\r\n      their Petition of Grievances; and, for answer, getting a\r\n      brand-new Gallows forty feet high? Hunger and Darkness, through\r\n      long years! For look back on that earlier Paris Riot, when a\r\n      Great Personage, worn out by debauchery, was believed to be in\r\n      want of Blood-baths; and Mothers, in worn raiment, yet with\r\n      living hearts under it, “filled the public places” with their\r\n      wild Rachel-cries,—stilled also by the Gallows. Twenty years ago,\r\n      the Friend of Men (preaching to the deaf) described the Limousin\r\n      Peasants as wearing a pain-stricken (_souffre-douleur_) look, a\r\n      look _past_ complaint, “as if the oppression of the great were\r\n      like the hail and the thunder, a thing irremediable, the\r\n      ordinance of Nature.”[212] And now, if in some great hour, the\r\n      shock of a falling Bastille should awaken you; and it were found\r\n      to be the ordinance of Art merely; and remediable, reversible!\r\n\r\n      Or has the Reader forgotten that “flood of savages,” which, in\r\n      sight of the same Friend of Men, descended from the mountains at\r\n      Mont d’Or? Lank-haired haggard faces; shapes rawboned, in high\r\n      sabots; in woollen jupes, with leather girdles studded with\r\n      copper-nails! They rocked from foot to foot, and beat time with\r\n      their elbows too, as the quarrel and battle which was not long in\r\n      beginning went on; shouting fiercely; the lank faces distorted\r\n      into the similitude of a cruel laugh. For they were darkened and\r\n      hardened: long had they been the prey of excise-men and tax-men;\r\n      of “clerks with the cold spurt of their pen.” It was the fixed\r\n      prophecy of our old Marquis, which no man would listen to, that\r\n      “such Government by Blind-man’s-buff, stumbling along too far,\r\n      would end by the General Overturn, the _Culbute Générale!_”\r\n\r\n      No man would listen, each went his thoughtless way;—and Time and\r\n      Destiny also travelled on. The Government by Blind-man’s-buff,\r\n      stumbling along, has reached the precipice inevitable for it.\r\n      Dull Drudgery, driven on, by clerks with the cold dastard spurt\r\n      of their pen, has been driven—into a Communion of Drudges! For\r\n      now, moreover, there have come the strangest confused tidings; by\r\n      Paris Journals with their paper wings; or still more portentous,\r\n      where no Journals are,[213] by rumour and conjecture: Oppression\r\n      _not_ inevitable; a Bastille prostrate, and the Constitution fast\r\n      getting ready! Which Constitution, if it be something and not\r\n      nothing, what can it be but bread to eat?\r\n\r\n      The Traveller, “walking up hill bridle in hand,” overtakes “a\r\n      poor woman;” the image, as such commonly are, of drudgery and\r\n      scarcity; “looking sixty years of age, though she is not yet\r\n      twenty-eight.” They have seven children, her poor drudge and she:\r\n      a farm, with one cow, which helps to make the children soup; also\r\n      one little horse, or garron. They have rents and quit-rents, Hens\r\n      to pay to this Seigneur, Oat-sacks to that; King’s taxes,\r\n      Statute-labour, Church-taxes, taxes enough;—and think the times\r\n      inexpressible. She has heard that some_where_, in some manner,\r\n      some_thing_ is to be done for the poor: ‘God send it soon; for\r\n      the dues and taxes crush us down (_nous écrasent_)!’[214]\r\n\r\n      Fair prophecies are spoken, but they are not fulfilled. There\r\n      have been Notables, Assemblages, turnings out and comings in.\r\n      Intriguing and manœuvring; Parliamentary eloquence and arguing,\r\n      Greek meeting Greek in high places, has long gone on; yet still\r\n      bread comes not. The harvest is reaped and garnered; yet still we\r\n      have no bread. Urged by despair and by hope, what can Drudgery\r\n      do, but rise, as predicted, and produce the General Overturn?\r\n\r\n      Fancy, then, some Five full-grown Millions of such gaunt figures,\r\n      with their haggard faces (_figures hâves_); in woollen jupes,\r\n      with copper-studded leather girths, and high sabots,—starting up\r\n      to ask, as in forest-roarings, their washed Upper-Classes, after\r\n      long unreviewed centuries, virtually this question: How have ye\r\n      treated us; how have ye taught us, fed us, and led us, while we\r\n      toiled for you? The answer can be read in flames, over the\r\n      nightly summer sky. _This_ is the feeding and leading we have had\r\n      of you: EMPTINESS,—of pocket, of stomach, of head, and of heart.\r\n      Behold there is _nothing in us;_ nothing but what Nature gives\r\n      her wild children of the desert: Ferocity and Appetite; Strength\r\n      grounded on Hunger. Did ye mark among your Rights of Man, that\r\n      man was not to die of starvation, while there was bread reaped by\r\n      him? It is among the Mights of Man.\r\n\r\n      Seventy-two Châteaus have flamed aloft in the Maconnais and\r\n      Beaujolais alone: this seems the centre of the conflagration; but\r\n      it has spread over Dauphiné, Alsace, the Lyonnais; the whole\r\n      South-East is in a blaze. All over the North, from Rouen to Metz,\r\n      disorder is abroad: smugglers of salt go openly in armed bands:\r\n      the barriers of towns are burnt; toll-gatherers, tax-gatherers,\r\n      official persons put to flight. “It was thought,” says Young,\r\n      “the people, from hunger, would revolt;” and we see they have\r\n      done it. Desperate Lackalls, long prowling aimless, now finding\r\n      hope in desperation itself, everywhere form a nucleus. They ring\r\n      the Church bell by way of tocsin: and the Parish turns out to the\r\n      work.[215] Ferocity, atrocity; hunger and revenge: such work as\r\n      we can imagine!\r\n\r\n      Ill stands it now with the Seigneur, who, for example, “has\r\n      walled up the only Fountain of the Township;” who has ridden high\r\n      on his _chartier_ and parchments; who has preserved Game not\r\n      wisely but too well. Churches also, and Canonries, are sacked,\r\n      without mercy; which have shorn the flock too close, forgetting\r\n      to feed it. Wo to the land over which Sansculottism, in its day\r\n      of vengeance, tramps roughshod,—shod in sabots! Highbred\r\n      Seigneurs, with their delicate women and little ones, had to “fly\r\n      half-naked,” under cloud of night; glad to escape the flames, and\r\n      even worse. You meet them at the _tables-d’hôte_ of inns; making\r\n      wise reflections or foolish that “rank is destroyed;” uncertain\r\n      whither they shall now wend.[216] The _métayer_ will find it\r\n      convenient to be slack in paying rent. As for the Tax-gatherer,\r\n      he, long hunting as a biped of prey, may now get hunted as one;\r\n      his Majesty’s Exchequer will not “fill up the Deficit,” this\r\n      season: it is the notion of many that a Patriot Majesty, being\r\n      the Restorer of French Liberty, has abolished most taxes, though,\r\n      for their private ends, some men make a secret of it.\r\n\r\n      Where this will end? In the Abyss, one may prophecy; whither all\r\n      Delusions are, at all moments, travelling; where this Delusion\r\n      has now arrived. For if there be a Faith, from of old, it is\r\n      this, as we often repeat, that no Lie can live for ever. The very\r\n      Truth has to change its vesture, from time to time; and be born\r\n      again. But all Lies have sentence of death written down against\r\n      them, and Heaven’s Chancery itself; and, slowly or fast, advance\r\n      incessantly towards their hour. “The sign of a Grand Seigneur\r\n      being landlord,” says the vehement plain-spoken Arthur Young,\r\n      “are wastes, _landes_, deserts, ling: go to his residence, you\r\n      will find it in the middle of a forest, peopled with deer, wild\r\n      boars and wolves. The fields are scenes of pitiable management,\r\n      as the houses are of misery. To see so many millions of hands,\r\n      that would be industrious, all idle and starving: Oh, if I were\r\n      legislator of France, for one day, I would make these great lords\r\n      skip again!”[217] O Arthur, thou now actually beholdest them\r\n      _skip;_—wilt thou grow to grumble at that too?\r\n\r\n      For long years and generations it lasted, but the time came.\r\n      Featherbrain, whom no reasoning and no pleading could touch, the\r\n      glare of the firebrand had to illuminate: there remained but that\r\n      method. Consider it, look at it! The widow is gathering nettles\r\n      for her children’s dinner; a perfumed Seigneur, delicately\r\n      lounging in the Œil-de-Bœuf, has an alchemy whereby he will\r\n      extract from her the third nettle, and name it Rent and Law: such\r\n      an arrangement must end. Ought it? But, O most fearful is _such_\r\n      an ending! Let those, to whom God, in His great mercy, has\r\n      granted time and space, prepare another and milder one.\r\n\r\n      To some it is a matter of wonder that the Seigneurs did not do\r\n      something to help themselves; say, combine, and arm: for there\r\n      were a “hundred and fifty thousand of them,” all violent enough.\r\n      Unhappily, a hundred and fifty thousand, scattered over wide\r\n      Provinces, divided by mutual ill-will, cannot combine. The\r\n      highest Seigneurs, as we have seen, had already emigrated,—with a\r\n      view of putting France to the blush. Neither are arms now the\r\n      peculiar property of Seigneurs; but of every mortal who has ten\r\n      shillings, wherewith to buy a secondhand firelock.\r\n\r\n      Besides, those starving Peasants, after all, have not four feet\r\n      and claws, that you could keep them down permanently in that\r\n      manner. They are not even of black colour; they are mere Unwashed\r\n      Seigneurs; and a Seigneur too has human bowels!—The Seigneurs did\r\n      what they could; enrolled in National Guards; fled, with shrieks,\r\n      complaining to Heaven and Earth. One Seigneur, famed Memmay of\r\n      Quincey, near Vesoul, invited all the rustics of his\r\n      neighbourhood to a banquet; blew up his Château and them with\r\n      gunpowder; and instantaneously vanished, no man yet knows\r\n      whither.[218] Some half dozen years after, he came back; and\r\n      demonstrated that it was by accident.\r\n\r\n      Nor are the authorities idle: though unluckily, all Authorities,\r\n      Municipalities and such like, are in the uncertain transitionary\r\n      state; getting regenerated from old Monarchic to new Democratic;\r\n      no Official yet knows clearly what he is. Nevertheless, Mayors\r\n      old or new do gather _Marechaussées_, National Guards, Troops of\r\n      the line; justice, of the most summary sort, is not wanting. The\r\n      Electoral Committee of Macon, though but a Committee, goes the\r\n      length of hanging, for its own behoof, as many as twenty. The\r\n      Prévôt of Dauphiné traverses the country “with a movable column,”\r\n      with tipstaves, gallows-ropes; for gallows any tree will serve,\r\n      and suspend its culprit, or “thirteen” culprits.\r\n\r\n      Unhappy country! How is the fair gold-and-green of the ripe\r\n      bright Year defaced with horrid blackness: black ashes of\r\n      Châteaus, black bodies of gibetted Men! Industry has ceased in\r\n      it; not sounds of the hammer and saw, but of the tocsin and\r\n      alarm-drum. The sceptre has departed, _whither_ one knows\r\n      not;—breaking itself in pieces: here impotent, there tyrannous.\r\n      National Guards are unskilful, and of doubtful purpose; Soldiers\r\n      are inclined to mutiny: there is danger that they two may\r\n      quarrel, danger that they may _agree_. Strasburg has seen riots:\r\n      a Townhall torn to shreds, its archives scattered white on the\r\n      winds; drunk soldiers embracing drunk citizens for three days,\r\n      and Mayor Dietrich and Marshal Rochambeau reduced nigh to\r\n      desperation.[219]\r\n\r\n      Through the middle of all which phenomena, is seen, on his\r\n      triumphant transit, “escorted,” through Béfort for instance, “by\r\n      fifty National Horsemen and all the military music of the\r\n      place,”—M. Necker, returning from Bale! Glorious as the meridian;\r\n      though poor Necker himself partly guesses whither it is\r\n      leading.[220] One highest culminating day, at the Paris Townhall;\r\n      with immortal vivats, with wife and daughter kneeling publicly to\r\n      kiss his hand; with Besenval’s pardon granted,—but indeed revoked\r\n      before sunset: one highest day, but then lower days, and ever\r\n      lower, down even to lowest! Such magic is in a name; and in the\r\n      want of a name. Like some enchanted Mambrino’s Helmet, essential\r\n      to victory, comes this “Saviour of France;” beshouted,\r\n      becymballed by the world:—alas, so soon, to be _dis_enchanted, to\r\n      be pitched shamefully over the lists as a Barber’s Bason! Gibbon\r\n      “could wish to shew him” (in this ejected, Barber’s-Bason state)\r\n      to any man of solidity, who were minded to have the soul burnt\r\n      out of him, and become a _caput mortuum_, by Ambition,\r\n      unsuccessful or successful.[221]\r\n\r\n      Another small phasis we add, and no more: how, in the Autumn\r\n      months, our sharp-tempered Arthur has been “pestered for some\r\n      days past,” by shot, lead-drops and slugs, “rattling five or six\r\n      times into my chaise and about my ears;” all the mob of the\r\n      country gone out to kill game![222] It is even so. On the Cliffs\r\n      of Dover, over all the Marches of France, there appear, this\r\n      autumn, two Signs on the Earth: emigrant flights of French\r\n      Seigneurs; emigrant winged flights of French Game! Finished, one\r\n      may say, or as good as finished, is the Preservation of Game on\r\n      this Earth; completed for endless Time. What part it had to play\r\n      in the History of Civilisation is played _plaudite; exeat!_\r\n\r\n      In this manner does Sansculottism blaze up, illustrating many\r\n      things;—producing, among the rest, as we saw, on the Fourth of\r\n      August, that semi-miraculous Night of Pentecost in the National\r\n      Assembly; semi miraculous, which had its causes, and its effects.\r\n      Feudalism is struck dead; not on parchment only, and by ink; but\r\n      in very fact, by fire; say, by self-combustion. This\r\n      conflagration of the South-East will abate; will be got\r\n      scattered, to the West, or elsewhither: extinguish it will not,\r\n      till the _fuel_ be all done.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.6.IV.\r\n      In Queue.\r\n\r\n      If we look now at Paris, one thing is too evident: that the\r\n      Baker’s shops have got their _Queues_, or Tails; their long\r\n      strings of purchasers, arranged _in tail_, so that the first come\r\n      be the first served,—were the shop once open! This waiting in\r\n      tail, not seen since the early days of July, again makes its\r\n      appearance in August. In time, we shall see it perfected by\r\n      practice to the rank almost of an art; and the art, or quasi-art,\r\n      of standing in tail become one of the characteristics of the\r\n      Parisian People, distinguishing them from all other Peoples\r\n      whatsoever.\r\n\r\n      But consider, while work itself is so scarce, how a man must not\r\n      only realise money; but stand waiting (if his wife is too weak to\r\n      wait and struggle) for half days in the Tail, till he get it\r\n      changed for dear bad bread! Controversies, to the length,\r\n      sometimes of blood and battery, must arise in these exasperated\r\n      Queues. Or if no controversy, then it is but one accordant _Pange\r\n      Lingua_ of complaint against the Powers that be. France has begun\r\n      her long Curriculum of Hungering, instructive and productive\r\n      beyond Academic Curriculums; which extends over some seven most\r\n      strenuous years. As Jean Paul says, of his own Life, “to a great\r\n      height shall the business of Hungering go.”\r\n\r\n      Or consider, in strange contrast, the jubilee Ceremonies; for, in\r\n      general, the aspect of Paris presents these two features: jubilee\r\n      ceremonials and scarcity of victual. Processions enough walk in\r\n      jubilee; of Young Women, decked and dizened, their ribands all\r\n      tricolor; moving with song and tabor, to the Shrine of Sainte\r\n      Genevieve, to thank her that the Bastille is down. The Strong Men\r\n      of the Market, and the Strong Women, fail not with their bouquets\r\n      and speeches. Abbé Fauchet, famed in such work (for Abbé Lefevre\r\n      could only distribute powder) blesses tricolor cloth for the\r\n      National Guard; and makes it a National Tricolor Flag;\r\n      victorious, or to be victorious, in the cause of civil and\r\n      religious liberty all over the world. Fauchet, we say, is the man\r\n      for _Te-Deums_, and public Consecrations;—to which, as in this\r\n      instance of the Flag, our National Guard will “reply with volleys\r\n      of musketry,” Church and Cathedral though it be;[223] filling\r\n      Notre Dame with such noisiest fuliginous Amen, significant of\r\n      several things.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, we will say our new Mayor Bailly; our new Commander\r\n      Lafayette, named also “Scipio-Americanus,” have bought their\r\n      preferment dear. Bailly rides in gilt state-coach, with\r\n      beefeaters and sumptuosity; Camille Desmoulins, and others,\r\n      sniffing at him for it: Scipio bestrides the “white charger,” and\r\n      waves with civic plumes in sight of all France. Neither of them,\r\n      however, does it for nothing; but, in truth, at an exorbitant\r\n      rate. At this rate, namely: of feeding Paris, and keeping it from\r\n      fighting. Out of the City-funds, some seventeen thousand of the\r\n      utterly destitute are employed digging on Montmartre, at tenpence\r\n      a day, which buys them, at market price, almost two pounds of bad\r\n      bread;—they look very yellow, when Lafayette goes to harangue\r\n      them. The Townhall is in travail, night and day; it must bring\r\n      forth Bread, a Municipal Constitution, regulations of all kinds,\r\n      curbs on the Sansculottic Press; above all, Bread, Bread.\r\n\r\n      Purveyors prowl the country far and wide, with the appetite of\r\n      lions; detect hidden grain, purchase open grain; by gentle means\r\n      or forcible, must and will find grain. A most thankless task; and\r\n      so difficult, so dangerous,—even if a man did gain some trifle by\r\n      it! On the 19th August, there is food for one day.[224]\r\n      Complaints there are that the food is spoiled, and produces an\r\n      effect on the intestines: not corn but plaster-of-Paris! Which\r\n      effect on the intestines, as well as that “smarting in the throat\r\n      and palate,” a Townhall Proclamation warns you to disregard, or\r\n      even to consider as drastic-beneficial. The Mayor of Saint-Denis,\r\n      so black was his bread, has, by a dyspeptic populace, been hanged\r\n      on the Lanterne there. National Guards protect the Paris\r\n      Corn-Market: first ten suffice; then six hundred.[225] Busy are\r\n      ye, Bailly, Brissot de Warville, Condorcet, and ye others!\r\n\r\n      For, as just hinted, there is a Municipal Constitution to be made\r\n      too. The old Bastille Electors, after some ten days of\r\n      psalmodying over their glorious victory, began to hear it asked,\r\n      in a splenetic tone, Who put you there? They accordingly had to\r\n      give place, not without moanings, and audible growlings on both\r\n      sides, to a new larger Body, specially elected for that post.\r\n      Which new Body, augmented, altered, then fixed finally at the\r\n      number of Three Hundred, with the title of Town Representatives\r\n      (_Représentans de la Commune_), now sits there; rightly portioned\r\n      into Committees; assiduous making a Constitution; at all moments\r\n      when not seeking flour.\r\n\r\n      And such a Constitution; little short of miraculous: one that\r\n      shall “consolidate the Revolution”! The Revolution is finished,\r\n      then? Mayor Bailly and all respectable friends of Freedom would\r\n      fain think so. Your Revolution, like jelly sufficiently _boiled_,\r\n      needs only to be poured into _shapes_, of Constitution, and\r\n      “consolidated” therein? Could it, indeed, contrive to _cool;_\r\n      which last, however, is precisely the doubtful thing, or even the\r\n      not doubtful!\r\n\r\n      Unhappy friends of Freedom; consolidating a Revolution! They must\r\n      sit at work there, their pavilion spread on very Chaos; between\r\n      two hostile worlds, the Upper Court-world, the Nether\r\n      Sansculottic one; and, beaten on by both, toil painfully,\r\n      perilously,—doing, in sad literal earnest, “the impossible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.6.V.\r\n      The Fourth Estate.\r\n\r\n      Pamphleteering opens its abysmal throat wider and wider: never to\r\n      close more. Our Philosophes, indeed, rather withdraw; after the\r\n      manner of Marmontel, “retiring in disgust the first day.” Abbé\r\n      Raynal, grown gray and quiet in his Marseilles domicile, is\r\n      little content with this work; the last literary act of the man\r\n      will again be an act of rebellion: an indignant _Letter to the\r\n      Constituent Assembly;_ answered by “the order of the day.” Thus\r\n      also Philosophe Morellet puckers discontented brows; being indeed\r\n      threatened in his benefices by that Fourth of August: it is\r\n      clearly going too far. How astonishing that those “haggard\r\n      figures in woollen jupes” would not rest as satisfied with\r\n      Speculation, and victorious Analysis, as we!\r\n\r\n      Alas, yes: Speculation, Philosophism, once the ornament and\r\n      wealth of the saloon, will now coin itself into mere Practical\r\n      Propositions, and circulate on street and highway, universally;\r\n      with results! A Fourth Estate, of Able Editors, springs up;\r\n      increases and multiplies; irrepressible, incalculable. New\r\n      Printers, new Journals, and ever new (so prurient is the world),\r\n      let our Three Hundred curb and consolidate as they can!\r\n      Loustalot, under the wing of Prudhomme dull-blustering Printer,\r\n      edits weekly his _Révolutions de Paris;_ in an acrid, emphatic\r\n      manner. Acrid, corrosive, as the spirit of sloes and copperas, is\r\n      Marat, _Friend of the People;_ struck already with the fact that\r\n      the National Assembly, so full of Aristocrats, “can do nothing,”\r\n      except dissolve itself, and make way for a better; that the\r\n      Townhall Representatives are little other than babblers and\r\n      imbeciles, if not even knaves. Poor is this man; squalid, and\r\n      dwells in garrets; a man unlovely to the sense, outward and\r\n      inward; a man forbid;—and is becoming fanatical, possessed with\r\n      fixed-idea. Cruel _lusus_ of Nature! Did Nature, O poor Marat, as\r\n      in cruel sport, knead thee out of her _leavings_, and\r\n      miscellaneous waste clay; and fling thee forth stepdamelike, a\r\n      Distraction into this distracted Eighteenth Century? Work is\r\n      appointed thee there; which thou shalt do. The Three Hundred have\r\n      summoned and will again summon Marat: but always he croaks forth\r\n      answer sufficient; always he will defy them, or elude them; and\r\n      endure no gag.\r\n\r\n      Carra, “Ex-secretary of a decapitated Hospodar,” and then of a\r\n      Necklace-Cardinal; likewise pamphleteer, Adventurer in many\r\n      scenes and lands,—draws nigh to Mercier, of the _Tableau de\r\n      Paris;_ and, with foam on his lips, proposes an _Annales\r\n      Patriotiques_. The _Moniteur_ goes its prosperous way; Barrère\r\n      “weeps,” on Paper as yet loyal; Rivarol, Royou are not idle. Deep\r\n      calls to deep: your _Domine Salvum Fac Regem_ shall awaken _Pange\r\n      Lingua;_ with an _Ami-du-Peuple_ there is a King’s-Friend\r\n      Newspaper, _Ami-du-Roi_. Camille Desmoulins has appointed himself\r\n      _Procureur-Général de la Lanterne_, Attorney-General of the\r\n      Lamp-iron; and pleads, _not_ with atrocity, under an atrocious\r\n      title; editing weekly his brilliant _Revolutions of Paris and\r\n      Brabant_. Brilliant, we say: for if, in that thick murk of\r\n      Journalism, with its dull blustering, with its fixed or loose\r\n      fury, any ray of genius greet thee, be sure it is Camille’s. The\r\n      thing that Camille teaches he, with his light finger, adorns:\r\n      brightness plays, gentle, unexpected, amid horrible confusions;\r\n      often is the word of Camille worth reading, when no other’s is.\r\n      Questionable Camille, how thou glitterest with a fallen,\r\n      rebellious, yet still semi-celestial light; as is the star-light\r\n      on the brow of Lucifer! Son of the Morning, into what times and\r\n      what lands, art thou fallen!\r\n\r\n      But in all things is good;—though not good for “consolidating\r\n      Revolutions.” Thousand wagon-loads of this Pamphleteering and\r\n      Newspaper matter, lie rotting slowly in the Public Libraries of\r\n      our Europe. Snatched from the great gulf, like oysters by\r\n      bibliomaniac pearl-divers, there must they first _rot_, then what\r\n      was pearl, in Camille or others, may be seen as such, and\r\n      continue as such.\r\n\r\n      Nor has public speaking declined, though Lafayette and his\r\n      Patrols look sour on it. Loud always is the Palais Royal, loudest\r\n      the Café de Foy; such a miscellany of Citizens and Citizenesses\r\n      circulating there. “Now and then,” according to Camille, “some\r\n      Citizens employ the liberty of the _press_ for a private purpose;\r\n      so that this or the other Patriot finds himself short of his\r\n      watch or pocket-handkerchief!” But, for the rest, in Camille’s\r\n      opinion, nothing can be a livelier image of the Roman Forum. “A\r\n      Patriot proposes his motion; if it finds any supporters, they\r\n      make him mount on a chair, and speak. If he is applauded, he\r\n      prospers and redacts; if he is hissed, he goes his ways.” Thus\r\n      they, circulating and perorating. Tall shaggy Marquis\r\n      Saint-Huruge, a man that has had losses, and has deserved them,\r\n      is seen eminent, and also heard. “Bellowing” is the character of\r\n      his voice, like that of a Bull of Bashan; voice which drowns all\r\n      voices, which causes frequently the hearts of men to leap.\r\n      Cracked or half-cracked is this tall Marquis’s head; uncracked\r\n      are his lungs; the cracked and the uncracked shall alike avail\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      Consider farther that each of the Forty-eight Districts has its\r\n      own Committee; speaking and motioning continually; aiding in the\r\n      search for grain, in the search for a Constitution; checking and\r\n      spurring the poor Three Hundred of the Townhall. That Danton,\r\n      with a “voice reverberating from the domes,” is President of the\r\n      Cordeliers District; which has already become a Goshen of\r\n      Patriotism. That apart from the “seventeen thousand utterly\r\n      necessitous, digging on Montmartre,” most of whom, indeed, have\r\n      got passes, and been dismissed into Space “with four\r\n      shillings,”—there is a _strike_, or union, of Domestics out of\r\n      place; who assemble for public speaking: next, a strike of\r\n      Tailors, for even they will strike and speak; further, a strike\r\n      of Journeymen Cordwainers; a strike of Apothecaries: so dear is\r\n      bread.[226] All these, having struck, must speak; generally under\r\n      the open canopy; and pass resolutions;—Lafayette and his Patrols\r\n      watching them suspiciously from the distance.\r\n\r\n      Unhappy mortals: such tugging and lugging, and throttling of one\r\n      another, to divide, in some not intolerable way, the joint\r\n      Felicity of man in this Earth; when the whole lot to be divided\r\n      is such a “feast of _shells!_”—Diligent are the Three Hundred;\r\n      none equals Scipio Americanus in dealing with mobs. But surely\r\n      all these things bode ill for the consolidating of a Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK VII.\r\n      THE INSURRECTION OF WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.I.\r\n      Patrollotism.\r\n\r\n      No, Friends, this Revolution is not of the consolidating kind. Do\r\n      not fires, fevers, sown seeds, chemical mixtures, men, events;\r\n      all embodiments of Force that work in this miraculous Complex of\r\n      Forces, named Universe,—go on _growing_, through their natural\r\n      phases and developments, each according to its kind; reach their\r\n      height, reach their visible decline; finally sink under,\r\n      vanishing, and what we call _die?_ They all grow; there is\r\n      nothing but what grows, and shoots forth into its special\r\n      expansion,—once give it leave to spring. Observe too that each\r\n      grows with a rapidity proportioned, in general, to the madness\r\n      and unhealthiness there is in it: slow regular growth, though\r\n      this also ends in death, is what we name health and sanity.\r\n\r\n      A Sansculottism, which has prostrated Bastilles, which has got\r\n      pike and musket, and now goes burning Châteaus, passing\r\n      resolutions and haranguing under roof and sky, may be said to\r\n      have sprung; and, by law of Nature, must grow. To judge by the\r\n      madness and diseasedness both of itself, and of the soil and\r\n      element it is in, one might expect the rapidity and monstrosity\r\n      would be extreme.\r\n\r\n      Many things too, especially all diseased things, grow by shoots\r\n      and fits. The first grand fit and shooting forth of Sansculottism\r\n      with that of Paris conquering its King; for Bailly’s figure of\r\n      rhetoric was all-too sad a reality. The King is conquered; going\r\n      at large on his parole; on condition, say, of absolutely good\r\n      behaviour,—which, in these circumstances, will unhappily mean no\r\n      behaviour whatever. A quite untenable position, that of Majesty\r\n      put on its good behaviour! Alas, is it not natural that whatever\r\n      lives try to keep itself living? Whereupon his Majesty’s\r\n      behaviour will soon become exceptionable; and so the Second grand\r\n      Fit of Sansculottism, that of putting him in durance, cannot be\r\n      distant.\r\n\r\n      Necker, in the National Assembly, is making moan, as usual about\r\n      his Deficit: Barriers and Customhouses burnt; the Tax-gatherer\r\n      hunted, not hunting; his Majesty’s Exchequer all but empty. The\r\n      remedy is a Loan of thirty millions; then, on still more enticing\r\n      terms, a Loan of eighty millions: neither of which Loans,\r\n      unhappily, will the Stockjobbers venture to lend. The Stockjobber\r\n      has no country, except his own black pool of _Agio_.\r\n\r\n      And yet, in those days, for men that have a country, what a glow\r\n      of patriotism burns in many a heart; penetrating inwards to the\r\n      very purse! So early as the 7th of August, a _Don Patriotique_,\r\n      “a Patriotic Gift of jewels to a considerable extent,” has been\r\n      solemnly made by certain Parisian women; and solemnly accepted,\r\n      with honourable mention. Whom forthwith all the world takes to\r\n      imitating and emulating. Patriotic Gifts, always with some heroic\r\n      eloquence, which the President must answer and the Assembly\r\n      listen to, flow in from far and near: in such number that the\r\n      honourable mention can only be performed in “lists published at\r\n      stated epochs.” Each gives what he can: the very cordwainers have\r\n      behaved munificently; one landed proprietor gives a forest;\r\n      fashionable society gives its shoebuckles, takes cheerfully to\r\n      shoe-ties. Unfortunate females give what they “have amassed in\r\n      loving.”[227] The smell of all cash, as Vespasian thought, is\r\n      good.\r\n\r\n      Beautiful, and yet inadequate! The Clergy must be “invited” to\r\n      melt their superfluous Church-plate,—in the Royal Mint. Nay\r\n      finally, a Patriotic Contribution, of the forcible sort, must be\r\n      determined on, though unwillingly: let the fourth part of your\r\n      declared yearly revenue, for this once only, be paid down; so\r\n      shall a National Assembly make the Constitution, undistracted at\r\n      least by insolvency. Their own wages, as settled on the 17th of\r\n      August, are but Eighteen Francs a day, each man; but the Public\r\n      Service must have sinews, must have money. To _appease_ the\r\n      Deficit; not to “_combler_, or choke the Deficit,” if you or\r\n      mortal could! For withal, as Mirabeau was heard saying, ‘it is\r\n      the Deficit that saves us.’\r\n\r\n      Towards the end of August, our National Assembly in its\r\n      constitutional labours, has got so far as the question of _Veto:_\r\n      shall Majesty have a Veto on the National Enactments; or not have\r\n      a Veto? What speeches were spoken, within doors and without;\r\n      clear, and also passionate logic; imprecations, comminations;\r\n      gone happily, for most part, to Limbo! Through the cracked brain,\r\n      and uncracked lungs of Saint-Huruge, the Palais Royal rebellows\r\n      with Veto. Journalism is busy, France rings with Veto. “I shall\r\n      never forget,” says Dumont, “my going to Paris, one of these\r\n      days, with Mirabeau; and the crowd of people we found waiting for\r\n      his carriage, about Le Jay the Bookseller’s shop. They flung\r\n      themselves before him; conjuring him with tears in their eyes not\r\n      to suffer the _Veto Absolu_. They were in a frenzy: ‘Monsieur le\r\n      Comte, you are the people’s father; you must save us; you must\r\n      defend us against those villains who are bringing back Despotism.\r\n      If the King get this Veto, what is the use of National Assembly?\r\n      We are slaves, all is done.’”[228] Friends, _if_ the sky fall,\r\n      there will be catching of larks! Mirabeau, adds Dumont, was\r\n      eminent on such occasions: he answered vaguely, with a Patrician\r\n      imperturbability, and bound himself to nothing.\r\n\r\n      Deputations go to the Hôtel-de-Ville; anonymous Letters to\r\n      Aristocrats in the National Assembly, threatening that fifteen\r\n      thousand, or sometimes that sixty thousand, “will march to\r\n      illuminate you.” The Paris Districts are astir; Petitions\r\n      signing: Saint-Huruge sets forth from the Palais Royal, with an\r\n      escort of fifteen hundred individuals, to petition in person.\r\n      Resolute, or seemingly so, is the tall shaggy Marquis, is the\r\n      Café de Foy: but resolute also is Commandant-General Lafayette.\r\n      The streets are all beset by Patrols: Saint-Huruge is stopped at\r\n      the _Barrière des Bon Hommes;_ he may bellow like the bulls of\r\n      Bashan; but absolutely must return. The brethren of the Palais\r\n      Royal “circulate all night,” and make motions, under the open\r\n      canopy; all Coffee-houses being shut. Nevertheless Lafayette and\r\n      the Townhall do prevail: Saint-Huruge is thrown into prison;\r\n      _Veto Absolu_ adjusts itself into _Suspensive Veto_, prohibition\r\n      not forever, but for a term of time; and this doom’s-clamour will\r\n      grow silent, as the others have done.\r\n\r\n      So far has Consolidation prospered, though with difficulty;\r\n      repressing the Nether Sansculottic world; and the Constitution\r\n      shall be made. With difficulty: amid jubilee and scarcity;\r\n      Patriotic Gifts, Bakers’-queues; Abbé-Fauchet Harangues, with\r\n      their _Amen_ of platoon-musketry! Scipio Americanus has deserved\r\n      thanks from the National Assembly and France. They offer him\r\n      stipends and emoluments, to a handsome extent; all which stipends\r\n      and emoluments he, covetous of far other blessedness than mere\r\n      money, does, in his chivalrous way, without scruple, refuse.\r\n\r\n      To the Parisian common man, meanwhile, one thing remains\r\n      inconceivable: that now when the Bastille is down, and French\r\n      Liberty restored, grain should continue so dear. Our Rights of\r\n      Man are voted, Feudalism and all Tyranny abolished; yet behold we\r\n      stand _in queue!_ Is it Aristocrat forestallers; a Court still\r\n      bent on intrigues? Something is rotten, somewhere.\r\n\r\n      And yet, alas, what to do? Lafayette, with his Patrols prohibits\r\n      every thing, even complaint. Saint-Huruge and other heroes of the\r\n      _Veto_ lie in durance. People’s-Friend Marat was seized; Printers\r\n      of Patriotic Journals are fettered and forbidden; the very\r\n      Hawkers cannot cry, till they get license, and leaden badges.\r\n      Blue National Guards ruthlessly dissipate all groups; scour, with\r\n      levelled bayonets, the Palais Royal itself. Pass, on your\r\n      affairs, along the Rue Taranne, the Patrol, presenting his\r\n      bayonet, cries, _To the left!_ Turn into the Rue Saint-Benoit, he\r\n      cries, _To the right!_ A judicious Patriot (like Camille\r\n      Desmoulins, in this instance) is driven, for quietness’s sake, to\r\n      take the gutter.\r\n\r\n      O much-suffering People, our glorious Revolution is evaporating\r\n      in tricolor ceremonies, and complimentary harangues! Of which\r\n      latter, as Loustalot acridly calculates, “upwards of two thousand\r\n      have been delivered within the last month, at the Townhall\r\n      alone.”[229] And our mouths, unfilled with bread, are to be shut,\r\n      under penalties? The Caricaturist promulgates his emblematic\r\n      Tablature: _Le Patrouillotisme chassant le Patriotisme_,\r\n      Patriotism driven out by Patrollotism. Ruthless Patrols; long\r\n      superfine harangues; and scanty ill-baked loaves, more like baked\r\n      Bath bricks,—which produce an effect on the intestines! Where\r\n      will this end? In consolidation?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.II.\r\n      O Richard, O my King.\r\n\r\n      For, alas, neither is the Townhall itself without misgivings. The\r\n      Nether Sansculottic world has been suppressed hitherto: but then\r\n      the Upper Court-world! Symptoms there are that the Œil-de-Bœuf is\r\n      rallying.\r\n\r\n      More than once in the Townhall Sanhedrim; often enough, from\r\n      those outspoken Bakers’-queues, has the wish uttered itself: O\r\n      that our Restorer of French Liberty were here; that he could see\r\n      with his own eyes, not with the false eyes of Queens and Cabals,\r\n      and his really good heart be enlightened! For falsehood still\r\n      environs him; intriguing Dukes de Guiche, with Bodyguards; scouts\r\n      of Bouillé; a new flight of intriguers, now that the old is\r\n      flown. What else means this advent of the _Regiment de Flandre;_\r\n      entering Versailles, as we hear, on the 23rd of September, with\r\n      two pieces of cannon? Did not the Versailles National Guard do\r\n      duty at the Château? Had they not Swiss; Hundred Swiss;\r\n      _Gardes-du-Corps_, Bodyguards so-called? Nay, it would seem, the\r\n      number of Bodyguards on duty has, by a manœuvre, been doubled:\r\n      the new relieving Battalion of them arrived at its time; but the\r\n      old relieved one does not _depart!_\r\n\r\n      Actually, there runs a whisper through the best informed\r\n      Upper-Circles, or a nod still more potentous than whispering, of\r\n      his Majesty’s flying to Metz; of a Bond (to stand by him therein)\r\n      which has been signed by Noblesse and Clergy, to the incredible\r\n      amount of thirty, or even of sixty thousand. Lafayette coldly\r\n      whispers it, and coldly asseverates it, to Count d’Estaing at the\r\n      Dinner-table; and d’Estaing, one of the bravest men, quakes to\r\n      the core lest some lackey overhear it; and tumbles thoughtful,\r\n      without sleep, all night.[230] Regiment Flandre, as we said, is\r\n      clearly arrived. His Majesty, they say, hesitates about\r\n      sanctioning the Fourth of August; makes observations, of chilling\r\n      tenor, on the very Rights of Man! Likewise, may not all persons,\r\n      the Bakers’-queues themselves discern on the streets of Paris,\r\n      the most astonishing number of Officers on furlough, Crosses of\r\n      St. Louis, and such like? Some reckon “from a thousand to twelve\r\n      hundred.” Officers of all uniforms; nay one uniform never before\r\n      seen by eye: green faced with red! The tricolor cockade is not\r\n      always visible: but what, in the name of Heaven, may these\r\n      _black_ cockades, which some wear, foreshadow?\r\n\r\n      Hunger whets everything, especially Suspicion and Indignation.\r\n      Realities themselves, in this Paris, have grown unreal:\r\n      preternatural. Phantasms once more stalk through the brain of\r\n      hungry France. O ye laggards and dastards, cry shrill voices from\r\n      the Queues, if ye had the hearts of men, ye would take your pikes\r\n      and secondhand firelocks, and look into it; not leave your wives\r\n      and daughters to be starved, murdered, and worse!—Peace, women!\r\n      The heart of man is bitter and heavy; Patriotism, driven out by\r\n      Patrollotism, knows not what to resolve on.\r\n\r\n      The truth is, the Œil-de-Bœuf has rallied; to a certain unknown\r\n      extent. A changed Œil-de-Bœuf; with Versailles National Guards,\r\n      in their tricolor cockades, doing duty there; a Court all flaring\r\n      with tricolor! Yet even to a tricolor Court men will rally. Ye\r\n      loyal hearts, burnt-out Seigneurs, rally round your Queen! With\r\n      wishes; which will produce hopes; which will produce attempts!\r\n\r\n      For indeed self-preservation being such a law of Nature, what can\r\n      a rallied Court do, but attempt and endeavour, or call it\r\n      _plot_,—with such wisdom and unwisdom as it has? They will fly,\r\n      escorted, to Metz, where brave Bouillé commands; they will raise\r\n      the Royal Standard: the Bond-signatures shall become armed men.\r\n      Were not the King so languid! Their Bond, if at all signed, must\r\n      be signed without his privity.—Unhappy King, _he_ has but one\r\n      resolution: not to have a civil war. For the rest, he still\r\n      hunts, having ceased lockmaking; he still dozes, and digests; is\r\n      clay in the hands of the potter. Ill will it fare with him, in a\r\n      world where all is helping itself; where, as has been written,\r\n      “whosoever is not hammer must be stithy;” and “the very hyssop on\r\n      the wall grows there, in that chink, because the whole Universe\r\n      could not prevent its growing!”\r\n\r\n      But as for the coming up of this Regiment de Flandre, may it not\r\n      be urged that there were Saint-Huruge Petitions, and continual\r\n      meal-mobs? Undebauched Soldiers, be there plot, or only dim\r\n      elements of a plot, are always good. Did not the Versailles\r\n      Municipality (an old Monarchic one, not yet refounded into a\r\n      Democratic) instantly second the proposal? Nay the very\r\n      Versailles National Guard, wearied with continual duty at the\r\n      Château, did not object; only Draper Lecointre, who is now Major\r\n      Lecointre, shook his head.—Yes, Friends, surely it was natural\r\n      this Regiment de Flandre should be sent for, since it could be\r\n      got. It was natural that, at sight of military bandoleers, the\r\n      heart of the rallied Œil-de-Bœuf should revive; and Maids of\r\n      Honour, and gentlemen of honour, speak comfortable words to\r\n      epauletted defenders, and to one another. Natural also, and mere\r\n      common civility, that the Bodyguards, a Regiment of Gentlemen,\r\n      should invite their Flandre brethren to a Dinner of welcome!—Such\r\n      invitation, in the last days of September, is given and accepted.\r\n\r\n      Dinners are defined as “the _ultimate_ act of communion;” men\r\n      that can have communion in nothing else, can sympathetically eat\r\n      together, can still rise into some glow of brotherhood over food\r\n      and wine. The dinner is fixed on, for Thursday the First of\r\n      October; and ought to have a fine effect. Further, as such Dinner\r\n      may be rather extensive, and even the Noncommissioned and the\r\n      Common man be introduced, to see and to hear, could not His\r\n      Majesty’s Opera Apartment, which has lain quite silent ever since\r\n      Kaiser Joseph was here, be obtained for the purpose?—The Hall of\r\n      the Opera is granted; the Salon d’Hercule shall be drawingroom.\r\n      Not only the Officers of Flandre, but of the Swiss, of the\r\n      Hundred Swiss, nay of the Versailles National Guard, such of them\r\n      as have any loyalty, shall feast: it will be a Repast like few.\r\n\r\n      And now suppose this Repast, the solid part of it, transacted;\r\n      and the first bottle over. Suppose the customary loyal toasts\r\n      drunk; the King’s health, the Queen’s with deafening vivats;—that\r\n      of the Nation “omitted,” or even “rejected.” Suppose champagne\r\n      flowing; with pot-valorous speech, with instrumental music; empty\r\n      feathered heads growing ever the noisier, in their own emptiness,\r\n      in each other’s noise! Her Majesty, who looks unusually sad\r\n      tonight (his Majesty sitting dulled with the day’s hunting), is\r\n      told that the sight of it would cheer her. Behold! She enters\r\n      there, issuing from her State-rooms, like the Moon from the\r\n      clouds, this fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts; royal Husband by\r\n      her side, young Dauphin in her arms! She descends from the Boxes,\r\n      amid splendour and acclaim; walks queen-like, round the Tables;\r\n      gracefully escorted, gracefully nodding; her looks full of\r\n      sorrow, yet of gratitude and daring, with the hope of France on\r\n      her mother-bosom! And now, the band striking up, _O Richard, O\r\n      mon Roi, l’univers t’abandonne_ (O Richard, O my King, and world\r\n      is all forsaking thee)—could man do other than rise to height of\r\n      pity, of loyal valour? Could featherheaded young ensigns do other\r\n      than, by white Bourbon Cockades, handed them from fair fingers;\r\n      by waving of swords, drawn to pledge the Queen’s health; by\r\n      trampling of National Cockades; by scaling the Boxes, whence\r\n      intrusive murmurs may come; by vociferation, tripudiation, sound,\r\n      fury and distraction, within doors and without,—testify what\r\n      tempest-tost state of vacuity they are in? Till champagne and\r\n      tripudiation do their work; and all lie silent, horizontal;\r\n      passively slumbering, with meed-of-battle dreams!—\r\n\r\n      A natural Repast, in ordinary times, a harmless one: now fatal,\r\n      as that of Thyestes; as that of Job’s Sons, when a strong wind\r\n      smote the four corners of their banquet-house! Poor ill-advised\r\n      Marie-Antoinette; with a woman’s vehemence, not with a\r\n      sovereign’s foresight! It was so natural, yet so unwise. Next\r\n      day, in public speech of ceremony, her Majesty declares herself\r\n      “delighted with the Thursday.”\r\n\r\n      The heart of the Œil-de-Bœuf glows into hope; into daring, which\r\n      is premature. Rallied Maids of Honour, waited on by Abbés, sew\r\n      “white cockades;” distribute them, with words, with glances, to\r\n      epauletted youths; who in return, may kiss, not without fervour,\r\n      the fair sewing fingers. Captains of horse and foot go swashing\r\n      with “enormous white cockades;” nay one Versailles National\r\n      Captain had mounted the like, so witching were the words and\r\n      glances; and laid aside his tricolor! Well may Major Lecointre\r\n      shake his head with a look of severity; and speak audible\r\n      resentful words. But now a swashbuckler, with enormous white\r\n      cockade, overhearing the Major, invites him insolently, once and\r\n      then again elsewhere, to recant; and failing that, to duel. Which\r\n      latter feat Major Lecointre declares that he will not perform,\r\n      not at least by any known laws of fence; that he nevertheless\r\n      will, according to mere law of Nature, by dirk and blade,\r\n      “exterminate” any “vile gladiator,” who may insult him or the\r\n      Nation;—whereupon (for the Major is actually drawing his\r\n      implement) “they are parted,” and no weasands slit.[231]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.III.\r\n      Black Cockades.\r\n\r\n      But fancy what effect this Thyestes Repast and trampling on the\r\n      National Cockade, must have had in the _Salle des Menus;_ in the\r\n      famishing Bakers’-queues at Paris! Nay such Thyestes Repasts, it\r\n      would seem, continue. Flandre has given its Counter-Dinner to the\r\n      Swiss and Hundred Swiss; then on Saturday there has been another.\r\n\r\n      Yes, here with us is famine; but yonder at Versailles is food;\r\n      enough and to spare! Patriotism stands in queue, shivering\r\n      hungerstruck, insulted by Patrollotism; while bloodyminded\r\n      Aristocrats, heated with excess of high living, trample on the\r\n      National Cockade. Can the atrocity be true? Nay, look: green\r\n      uniforms faced with red; black cockades,—the colour of Night! Are\r\n      we to have military onfall; and death also by starvation? For\r\n      behold the Corbeil Cornboat, which used to come twice a-day, with\r\n      its Plaster-of-Paris meal, now comes only once. And the Townhall\r\n      is deaf; and the men are laggard and dastard!—At the Café de Foy,\r\n      this Saturday evening, a new thing is seen, not the last of its\r\n      kind: a woman engaged in public speaking. Her poor man, she says,\r\n      was put to silence by his District; their Presidents and\r\n      Officials would not let him speak. Wherefore she here with her\r\n      shrill tongue will speak; denouncing, while her breath endures,\r\n      the Corbeil-Boat, the Plaster-of-Paris bread, sacrilegious\r\n      Opera-dinners, green uniforms, Pirate Aristocrats, and those\r\n      black cockades of theirs!—\r\n\r\n      Truly, it is time for the black cockades at least, to vanish.\r\n      Them Patrollotism itself will not protect. Nay, sharp-tempered\r\n      “M. Tassin,” at the Tuileries parade on Sunday morning, forgets\r\n      all National military rule; starts from the ranks, wrenches down\r\n      one black cockade which is swashing ominous there; and tramples\r\n      it fiercely into the soil of France. Patrollotism itself is not\r\n      without suppressed fury. Also the Districts begin to stir; the\r\n      voice of President Danton reverberates in the Cordeliers:\r\n      People’s-Friend Marat has flown to Versailles and back\r\n      again;—swart bird, not of the halcyon kind![232]\r\n\r\n      And so Patriot meets promenading Patriot, this Sunday; and sees\r\n      his own grim care reflected on the face of another. Groups, in\r\n      spite of Patrollotism, which is not so alert as usual, fluctuate\r\n      deliberative: groups on the Bridges, on the Quais, at the\r\n      patriotic Cafés. And ever as any black cockade may emerge, rises\r\n      the many-voiced growl and bark: _À bas_, Down! All black cockades\r\n      are ruthlessly plucked off: one individual picks his up again;\r\n      kisses it, attempts to refix it; but a “hundred canes start into\r\n      the air,” and he desists. Still worse went it with another\r\n      individual; doomed, by extempore _Plebiscitum_, to the Lanterne;\r\n      saved, with difficulty, by some active\r\n      _Corps-de-Garde_.—Lafayette sees signs of an effervescence; which\r\n      he doubles his Patrols, doubles his diligence, to prevent. So\r\n      passes Sunday, the 4th of October 1789.\r\n\r\n      Sullen is the male heart, repressed by Patrollotism; vehement is\r\n      the female, irrepressible. The public-speaking woman at the\r\n      Palais Royal was not the only speaking one:—Men know not what the\r\n      pantry is, when it grows empty, only house-mothers know. O women,\r\n      wives of men that will only calculate and not act! Patrollotism\r\n      is strong; but Death, by starvation and military onfall, is\r\n      stronger. Patrollotism represses male Patriotism: but female\r\n      Patriotism? Will Guards named National thrust their bayonets into\r\n      the bosoms of women? Such thought, or rather such dim unshaped\r\n      raw-material of a thought, ferments universally under the female\r\n      night-cap; and, by earliest daybreak, on slight hint, will\r\n      explode.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.IV.\r\n      The Menads.\r\n\r\n      If Voltaire once, in splenetic humour, asked his countrymen: ‘But\r\n      you, _Gualches_, what have you invented?’ they can now answer:\r\n      The Art of Insurrection. It was an art needed in these last\r\n      singular times: an art, for which the French nature, so full of\r\n      vehemence, so free from depth, was perhaps of all others the\r\n      fittest.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, to what a height, one may well say of perfection,\r\n      has this branch of human industry been carried by France, within\r\n      the last half-century! Insurrection, which, Lafayette thought,\r\n      might be “the most sacred of duties,” ranks now, for the French\r\n      people, among the duties which they can perform. Other mobs are\r\n      dull masses; which roll onwards with a dull fierce tenacity, a\r\n      dull fierce heat, but emit no light-flashes of genius as they go.\r\n      The French mob, again, is among the liveliest phenomena of our\r\n      world. So rapid, audacious; so clear-sighted, inventive, prompt\r\n      to seize the moment; instinct with life to its finger-ends! That\r\n      talent, were there no other, of spontaneously standing in queue,\r\n      distinguishes, as we said, the French People from all Peoples,\r\n      ancient and modern.\r\n\r\n      Let the Reader confess too that, taking one thing with another,\r\n      perhaps few terrestrial Appearances are better worth considering\r\n      than mobs. Your mob is a genuine outburst of Nature; issuing\r\n      from, or communicating with, the deepest deep of Nature. When so\r\n      much goes grinning and grimacing as a lifeless Formality, and\r\n      under the stiff buckram no heart can be felt beating, here once\r\n      more, if nowhere else, is a Sincerity and Reality. Shudder at it;\r\n      or even shriek over it, if thou must; nevertheless consider it.\r\n      Such a Complex of human Forces and Individualities hurled forth,\r\n      in their transcendental mood, to act and react, on circumstances\r\n      and on one another; to work out what it is in them to work. The\r\n      thing they will do is known to no man; least of all to\r\n      themselves. It is the inflammablest immeasurable Fire-work,\r\n      generating, consuming itself. With what phases, to what extent,\r\n      with what results it will burn off, Philosophy and Perspicacity\r\n      conjecture in vain.\r\n\r\n      “Man,” as has been written, “is for ever interesting to man; nay\r\n      properly there is nothing else interesting.” In which light also,\r\n      may we not discern why most Battles have become so wearisome?\r\n      Battles, in these ages, are transacted by mechanism; with the\r\n      slightest possible developement of human individuality or\r\n      spontaneity: men now even die, and kill one another, in an\r\n      artificial manner. Battles ever since Homer’s time, when they\r\n      were Fighting Mobs, have mostly ceased to be worth looking at,\r\n      worth reading of, or remembering. How many wearisome bloody\r\n      Battles does History strive to represent; or even, in a husky\r\n      way, to sing:—and she would omit or carelessly slur-over this one\r\n      Insurrection of Women?\r\n\r\n      A thought, or dim raw-material of a thought, was fermenting all\r\n      night, universally in the female head, and might explode. In\r\n      squalid garret, on Monday morning, Maternity awakes, to hear\r\n      children weeping for bread. Maternity must forth to the streets,\r\n      to the herb-markets and Bakers’—queues; meets there with\r\n      hunger-stricken Maternity, sympathetic, exasperative. O we\r\n      unhappy women! But, instead of Bakers’-queues, why not to\r\n      Aristocrats’ palaces, the root of the matter? _Allons!_ Let us\r\n      assemble. To the Hôtel-de-Ville; to Versailles; to the Lanterne!\r\n\r\n      In one of the Guardhouses of the Quartier Saint-Eustache, “a\r\n      young woman” seizes a drum,—for how shall National Guards give\r\n      fire on women, on a young woman? The young woman seizes the drum;\r\n      sets forth, beating it, “uttering cries relative to the dearth of\r\n      grains.” Descend, O mothers; descend, ye Judiths, to food and\r\n      revenge!—All women gather and go; crowds storm all stairs, force\r\n      out all women: the female Insurrectionary Force, according to\r\n      Camille, resembles the English Naval one; there is a universal\r\n      “Press of women.” Robust Dames of the Halle, slim Mantua-makers,\r\n      assiduous, risen with the dawn; ancient Virginity tripping to\r\n      matins; the Housemaid, with early broom; all must go. Rouse ye, O\r\n      women; the laggard men will not act; they say, we ourselves may\r\n      act!\r\n\r\n      And so, like snowbreak from the mountains, for every staircase is\r\n      a melted brook, it storms; tumultuous, wild-shrilling, towards\r\n      the Hôtel-de-Ville. Tumultuous, with or without drum-music: for\r\n      the Faubourg Saint-Antoine also has tucked up its gown; and, with\r\n      besom-staves, fire-irons, and even rusty pistols (void of\r\n      ammunition), is flowing on. Sound of it flies, with a velocity of\r\n      sound, to the outmost Barriers. By seven o’clock, on this raw\r\n      October morning, fifth of the month, the Townhall will see\r\n      wonders. Nay, as chance would have it, a male party are already\r\n      there; clustering tumultuously round some National Patrol, and a\r\n      Baker who has been seized with short weights. They are there; and\r\n      have even lowered the rope of the Lanterne. So that the official\r\n      persons have to smuggle forth the short-weighing Baker by back\r\n      doors, and even send “to all the Districts” for more force.\r\n\r\n      Grand it was, says Camille, to see so many Judiths, from eight to\r\n      ten thousand of them in all, rushing out to search into the root\r\n      of the matter! Not unfrightful it must have been;\r\n      ludicro-terrific, and most unmanageable. At such hour the\r\n      overwatched Three Hundred are not yet stirring: none but some\r\n      Clerks, a company of National Guards; and M. de Gouvion, the\r\n      Major-general. Gouvion has fought in America for the cause of\r\n      civil Liberty; a man of no inconsiderable heart, but deficient in\r\n      head. He is, for the moment, in his back apartment; assuaging\r\n      Usher Maillard, the Bastille-serjeant, who has come, as too many\r\n      do, with “representations.” The assuagement is still incomplete\r\n      when our Judiths arrive.\r\n\r\n      The National Guards form on the outer stairs, with levelled\r\n      bayonets; the ten thousand Judiths press up, resistless; with\r\n      obtestations, with outspread hands,—merely to speak to the Mayor.\r\n      The rear forces them; nay, from male hands in the rear, stones\r\n      already fly: the National Guards must do one of two things; sweep\r\n      the Place de Grève with cannon, or else open to right and left.\r\n      They open; the living deluge rushes in. Through all rooms and\r\n      cabinets, upwards to the topmost belfry: ravenous; seeking arms,\r\n      seeking Mayors, seeking justice;—while, again, the better-cressed\r\n      (dressed?) speak kindly to the Clerks; point out the misery of\r\n      these poor women; also their ailments, some even of an\r\n      interesting sort.[233]\r\n\r\n      Poor M. de Gouvion is shiftless in this extremity;—a man\r\n      shiftless, perturbed; who will one day commit suicide. How happy\r\n      for him that Usher Maillard, the shifty, was there, at the\r\n      moment, though making representations! Fly back, thou shifty\r\n      Maillard; seek the Bastille Company; and O return fast with it;\r\n      above all, with thy own shifty head! For, behold, the Judiths can\r\n      find no Mayor or Municipal; scarcely, in the topmost belfry, can\r\n      they find poor Abbé Lefevre the Powder-distributor. Him, for want\r\n      of a better, they suspend there; in the pale morning light; over\r\n      the top of all Paris, which swims in one’s failing eyes:—a\r\n      horrible end? Nay, the rope broke, as French ropes often did; or\r\n      else an Amazon cut it. Abbé Lefevre falls, some twenty feet,\r\n      rattling among the leads; and lives long years after, though\r\n      always with “a _tremblement_ in the limbs.”[234]\r\n\r\n      And now doors fly under hatchets; the Judiths have broken the\r\n      Armoury; have seized guns and cannons, three money-bags,\r\n      paper-heaps; torches flare: in few minutes, our brave\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville which dates from the Fourth Henry, will, with all\r\n      that it holds, be in flames!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.V.\r\n      Usher Maillard.\r\n\r\n      In flames, truly,—were it not that Usher Maillard, swift of foot,\r\n      shifty of head, has returned!\r\n\r\n      Maillard, of his own motion, for Gouvion or the rest would not\r\n      even sanction him,—snatches a drum; descends the Porch-stairs,\r\n      ran-tan, beating sharp, with loud rolls, his Rogues’-march: To\r\n      Versailles! _Allons; a Versailles!_ As men beat on kettle or\r\n      warmingpan, when angry she-bees, or say, flying desperate wasps,\r\n      are to be hived; and the desperate insects hear it, and cluster\r\n      round it,—simply as round a guidance, where there was none: so\r\n      now these Menads round shifty Maillard, Riding-Usher of the\r\n      Châtelet. The axe pauses uplifted; Abbé Lefevre is left\r\n      half-hanged; from the belfry downwards all vomits itself. What\r\n      rub-a-dub is that? Stanislas Maillard, Bastille-hero, will lead\r\n      us to Versailles? Joy to thee, Maillard; blessed art thou above\r\n      Riding-Ushers! Away then, away!\r\n\r\n      The seized cannon are yoked with seized cart-horses: brown-locked\r\n      Demoiselle Théroigne, with pike and helmet, sits there as\r\n      gunneress, “with haughty eye and serene fair countenance;”\r\n      comparable, some think, to the _Maid_ of Orléans, or even\r\n      recalling “the idea of Pallas Athene.”[235] Maillard (for his\r\n      drum still rolls) is, by heaven-rending acclamation, admitted\r\n      General. Maillard hastens the languid march. Maillard, beating\r\n      rhythmic, with sharp ran-tan, all along the Quais, leads forward,\r\n      with difficulty his Menadic host. Such a host—marched not in\r\n      silence! The bargeman pauses on the River; all wagoners and\r\n      coachdrivers fly; men peer from windows,—not women, lest they be\r\n      pressed. Sight of sights: Bacchantes, in these ultimate\r\n      Formalized Ages! Bronze Henri looks on, from his Pont-Neuf; the\r\n      Monarchic Louvre, Medicean Tuileries see a day not theretofore\r\n      seen.\r\n\r\n      And now Maillard has his Menads in the _Champs Elysées_ (Fields\r\n      _Tartarean_ rather); and the Hôtel-de-Ville has suffered\r\n      comparatively nothing. Broken doors; an Abbé Lefevre, who shall\r\n      never more distribute powder; three sacks of money, most part of\r\n      which (for Sansculottism, though famishing, is not without\r\n      honour) shall be returned:[236] this is all the damage. Great\r\n      Maillard! A small nucleus of Order is round his drum; but his\r\n      outskirts fluctuate like the mad Ocean: for Rascality male and\r\n      female is flowing in on him, from the four winds; guidance there\r\n      is none but in his single head and two drumsticks.\r\n\r\n      O Maillard, when, since War first was, had General of Force such\r\n      a task before him, as thou this day? Walter the Penniless still\r\n      touches the feeling heart: but then Walter had sanction; had\r\n      space to turn in; and also his Crusaders were of the male sex.\r\n      Thou, this day, disowned of Heaven and Earth, art General of\r\n      Menads. Their inarticulate frenzy thou must on the spur of the\r\n      instant, render into articulate words, into actions that are not\r\n      frantic. Fail in it, this way or that! Pragmatical Officiality,\r\n      with its penalties and law-books, waits before thee; Menads storm\r\n      behind. If such hewed off the melodious head of Orpheus, and\r\n      hurled it into the Peneus waters, what may they not make of\r\n      thee,—thee rhythmic merely, with no music but a sheepskin\r\n      drum!—Maillard did not fail. Remarkable Maillard, if fame were\r\n      not an accident, and History a distillation of Rumour, how\r\n      remarkable wert thou!\r\n\r\n      On the Elysian Fields, there is pause and fluctuation; but, for\r\n      Maillard, no return. He persuades his Menads, clamorous for arms\r\n      and the Arsenal, that no arms are in the Arsenal; that an unarmed\r\n      attitude, and petition to a National Assembly, will be the best:\r\n      he hastily nominates or sanctions generalesses, captains of tens\r\n      and fifties;—and so, in loosest-flowing order, to the rhythm of\r\n      some “eight drums” (having laid aside his own), with the Bastille\r\n      Volunteers bringing up his rear, once more takes the road.\r\n\r\n      Chaillot, which will promptly yield baked loaves, is not\r\n      plundered; nor are the Sèvres Potteries broken. The old arches of\r\n      Sèvres Bridge echo under Menadic feet; Seine River gushes on with\r\n      his perpetual murmur; and Paris flings after us the boom of\r\n      tocsin and alarm-drum,—inaudible, for the present, amid\r\n      shrill-sounding hosts, and the splash of rainy weather. To\r\n      Meudon, to Saint Cloud, on both hands, the report of them is gone\r\n      abroad; and hearths, this evening, will have a topic. The press\r\n      of women still continues, for it is the cause of all Eve’s\r\n      Daughters, mothers that are, or that hope to be. No\r\n      carriage-lady, were it with never such hysterics, but must\r\n      dismount, in the mud roads, in her silk shoes, and walk.[237] In\r\n      this manner, amid wild October weather, they a wild unwinged\r\n      stork-flight, through the astonished country, wend their way.\r\n      Travellers of all sorts they stop; especially travellers or\r\n      couriers from Paris. Deputy Lechapelier, in his elegant vesture,\r\n      from his elegant vehicle, looks forth amazed through his\r\n      spectacles; apprehensive for life;—states eagerly that he is\r\n      Patriot-Deputy Lechapelier, and even Old-President Lechapelier,\r\n      who presided on the Night of Pentecost, and is original member of\r\n      the Breton Club. Thereupon “rises huge shout of _Vive\r\n      Lechapelier_, and several armed persons spring up behind and\r\n      before to escort him.”[238]\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, news, despatches from Lafayette, or vague noise of\r\n      rumour, have pierced through, by side roads. In the National\r\n      Assembly, while all is busy discussing the order of the day;\r\n      regretting that there should be Anti-national Repasts in\r\n      Opera-Halls; that his Majesty should still hesitate about\r\n      accepting the Rights of Man, and hang conditions and\r\n      peradventures on them,—Mirabeau steps up to the President,\r\n      experienced Mounier as it chanced to be; and articulates, in bass\r\n      under-tone: ‘_Mounier, Paris marche sur nous_ (Paris is marching\r\n      on us).’—‘May be (_Je n’en sais rien_)!’—‘Believe it or\r\n      disbelieve it, that is not my concern; but Paris, I say, is\r\n      marching on us. Fall suddenly unwell; go over to the Château;\r\n      tell them this. There is not a moment to lose.’—‘Paris marching\r\n      on us?’ responds Mounier, with an atrabiliar accent, ‘Well, so\r\n      much the better! We shall the sooner be a Republic.’ Mirabeau\r\n      quits him, as one quits an experienced President getting\r\n      blindfold into deep waters; and the order of the day continues as\r\n      before.\r\n\r\n      Yes, Paris is marching on us; and more than the women of Paris!\r\n      Scarcely was Maillard gone, when M. de Gouvion’s message to all\r\n      the Districts, and such tocsin and drumming of the _générale_,\r\n      began to take effect. Armed National Guards from every District;\r\n      especially the Grenadiers of the Centre, who are our old Gardes\r\n      Françaises, arrive, in quick sequence, on the Place de Grève. An\r\n      “immense people” is there; Saint-Antoine, with pike and rusty\r\n      firelock, is all crowding thither, be it welcome or unwelcome.\r\n      The Centre Grenadiers are received with cheering: ‘it is not\r\n      cheers that we want,’ answer they gloomily; ‘the nation has been\r\n      insulted; to arms, and come with us for orders!’ Ha, sits the\r\n      wind _so?_ Patriotism and Patrollotism are now one!\r\n\r\n      The Three Hundred have assembled; “all the Committees are in\r\n      activity;” Lafayette is dictating despatches for Versailles, when\r\n      a Deputation of the Centre Grenadiers introduces itself to him.\r\n      The Deputation makes military obeisance; and thus speaks, not\r\n      without a kind of thought in it: ‘_Mon Général_, we are deputed\r\n      by the Six Companies of Grenadiers. We do not think you a\r\n      traitor, but we think the Government betrays you; it is time that\r\n      this end. We cannot turn our bayonets against women crying to us\r\n      for bread. The people are miserable, the source of the mischief\r\n      is at Versailles: we must go seek the King, and bring him to\r\n      Paris. We must exterminate (_exterminer_) the _Regiment de\r\n      Flandre_ and the _Gardes-du-Corps_, who have dared to trample on\r\n      the National Cockade. If the King be too weak to wear his crown,\r\n      let him lay it down. You will crown his Son, you will name a\r\n      Council of Regency; and all will go better.’[239] Reproachful\r\n      astonishment paints itself on the face of Lafayette; speaks\r\n      itself from his eloquent chivalrous lips: in vain. ‘My General,\r\n      we would shed the last drop of our blood for you; but the root of\r\n      the mischief is at Versailles; we must go and bring the King to\r\n      Paris; all the people wish it, _tout le peuple le veut_.’\r\n\r\n      My General descends to the outer staircase; and harangues: once\r\n      more in vain. ‘To Versailles! To Versailles!’ Mayor Bailly, sent\r\n      for through floods of Sansculottism, attempts academic oratory\r\n      from his gilt state-coach; realizes nothing but infinite hoarse\r\n      cries of: ‘Bread! To Versailles!’—and gladly shrinks within\r\n      doors. Lafayette mounts the white charger; and again harangues\r\n      and reharangues: with eloquence, with firmness, indignant\r\n      demonstration; with all things but persuasion. ‘To Versailles! To\r\n      Versailles!’ So lasts it, hour after hour; for the space of half\r\n      a day.\r\n\r\n      The great Scipio Americanus can do nothing; not so much as\r\n      escape. ‘_Morbleu, mon Général_,’ cry the Grenadiers serrying\r\n      their ranks as the white charger makes a motion that way, ‘You\r\n      will not leave us, you will abide with us!’ A perilous juncture:\r\n      Mayor Bailly and the Municipals sit quaking within doors; My\r\n      General is prisoner without: the Place de Grève, with its thirty\r\n      thousand Regulars, its whole irregular Saint-Antoine and\r\n      Saint-Marceau, is one minatory mass of clear or rusty steel; all\r\n      hearts set, with a moody fixedness, on one object. Moody, fixed\r\n      are all hearts: tranquil is no heart,—if it be not that of the\r\n      white charger, who paws there, with arched neck, composedly\r\n      champing his bit; as if no world, with its Dynasties and Eras,\r\n      were now rushing down. The drizzly day tends westward; the cry is\r\n      still: ‘To Versailles!’\r\n\r\n      Nay now, borne from afar, come quite sinister cries; hoarse,\r\n      reverberating in longdrawn hollow murmurs, with syllables too\r\n      like those of _Lanterne!_ Or else, irregular Sansculottism may be\r\n      marching off, of itself; with pikes, nay with cannon. The\r\n      inflexible Scipio does at length, by aide-de-camp, ask of the\r\n      Municipals: Whether or not he may go? A Letter is handed out to\r\n      him, over armed heads; sixty thousand faces flash fixedly on his,\r\n      there is stillness and no bosom breathes, till he have read. By\r\n      Heaven, he grows suddenly pale! Do the Municipals permit? “Permit\r\n      and even order,”—since he can no other. Clangour of approval\r\n      rends the welkin. To your ranks, then; let us march!\r\n\r\n      It is, as we compute, towards three in the afternoon. Indignant\r\n      National Guards may dine for once from their haversack: dined or\r\n      undined, they march with one heart. Paris flings up her windows,\r\n      claps hands, as the Avengers, with their shrilling drums and\r\n      shalms tramp by; she will then sit pensive, apprehensive, and\r\n      pass rather a sleepless night.[240] On the white charger,\r\n      Lafayette, in the slowest possible manner, going and coming, and\r\n      eloquently haranguing among the ranks, rolls onward with his\r\n      thirty thousand. Saint-Antoine, with pike and cannon, has\r\n      preceded him; a mixed multitude, of all and of no arms, hovers on\r\n      his flanks and skirts; the country once more pauses agape: _Paris\r\n      marche sur nous_.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.VI.\r\n      To Versailles.\r\n\r\n      For, indeed, about this same moment, Maillard has halted his\r\n      draggled Menads on the last hill-top; and now Versailles, and the\r\n      Château of Versailles, and far and wide the inheritance of\r\n      Royalty opens to the wondering eye. From far on the right, over\r\n      Marly and Saint-Germains-en-Laye; round towards Rambouillet, on\r\n      the left: beautiful all; softly embosomed; as if in sadness, in\r\n      the dim moist weather! And near before us is Versailles, New and\r\n      Old; with that broad frondent _Avenue de Versailles_\r\n      between,—stately-frondent, broad, three hundred feet as men\r\n      reckon, with four Rows of Elms; and then the _Château de\r\n      Versailles_, ending in royal Parks and Pleasances, gleaming\r\n      lakelets, arbours, Labyrinths, the _Ménagerie_, and Great and\r\n      Little Trianon. High-towered dwellings, leafy pleasant places;\r\n      where the gods of this lower world abide: whence, nevertheless,\r\n      black Care cannot be excluded; whither Menadic Hunger is even now\r\n      advancing, armed with pike-thyrsi!\r\n\r\n      Yes, yonder, Mesdames, where our straight frondent Avenue,\r\n      joined, as you note, by Two frondent brother Avenues from this\r\n      hand and from that, spreads out into Place Royale and Palace\r\n      Forecourt; yonder is the _Salle des Menus_. Yonder an august\r\n      Assembly sits regenerating France. Forecourt, Grand Court, Court\r\n      of Marble, Court narrowing into Court you may discern next, or\r\n      fancy: on the extreme verge of which that glass-dome, visibly\r\n      glittering like a star of hope, is the—Œil-de-Bœuf! Yonder, or\r\n      nowhere in the world, is bread baked for us. But, O Mesdames,\r\n      were not one thing good: That our cannons, with Demoiselle\r\n      Théroigne and all show of war, be put to the rear? Submission\r\n      beseems petitioners of a National Assembly; we are strangers in\r\n      Versailles,—whence, too audibly, there comes even now sound as of\r\n      tocsin and _générale!_ Also to put on, if possible, a cheerful\r\n      countenance, hiding our sorrows; and even to sing? Sorrow, pitied\r\n      of the Heavens, is hateful, suspicious to the Earth.—So counsels\r\n      shifty Maillard; haranguing his Menads, on the heights near\r\n      Versailles.[241]\r\n\r\n      Cunning Maillard’s dispositions are obeyed. The draggled\r\n      Insurrectionists advance up the Avenue, “in three columns”, among\r\n      the four Elm-rows; “singing _Henri Quatre_,” with what melody\r\n      they can; and shouting _Vive le Roi_. Versailles, though the\r\n      Elm-rows are dripping wet, crowds from both sides, with: ‘_Vivent\r\n      nos Parisiennes_, Our Paris ones for ever!’\r\n\r\n      Prickers, scouts have been out towards Paris, as the rumour\r\n      deepened: whereby his Majesty, gone to shoot in the Woods of\r\n      Meudon, has been happily discovered, and got home; and the\r\n      _générale_ and tocsin set a-sounding. The Bodyguards are already\r\n      drawn up in front of the Palace Grates; and look down the Avenue\r\n      de Versailles; sulky, in wet buckskins. Flandre too is there,\r\n      repentant of the Opera-Repast. Also Dragoons dismounted are\r\n      there. Finally Major Lecointre, and what he can gather of the\r\n      Versailles National Guard; though, it is to be observed, our\r\n      Colonel, that same sleepless Count d’Estaing, giving neither\r\n      order nor ammunition, has vanished most improperly; one supposes,\r\n      into the Œil-de-Bœuf. Red-coated Swiss stand within the Grates,\r\n      under arms. There likewise, in their inner room, “all the\r\n      Ministers,” Saint-Priest, Lamentation Pompignan and the rest, are\r\n      assembled with M. Necker: they sit with him there; blank,\r\n      expecting what the hour will bring.\r\n\r\n      President Mounier, though he answered Mirabeau with a _tant\r\n      mieux_, and affected to slight the matter, had his own\r\n      forebodings. Surely, for these four weary hours, he has reclined\r\n      not on roses! The order of the day is getting forward: a\r\n      Deputation to his Majesty seems proper, that it might please him\r\n      to grant “Acceptance pure and simple” to those\r\n      Constitution-Articles of ours; the “mixed qualified Acceptance,”\r\n      with its peradventures, is satisfactory to neither gods nor men.\r\n\r\n      So much is clear. And yet there is more, which no man speaks,\r\n      which all men now vaguely understand. Disquietude, absence of\r\n      mind is on every face; Members whisper, uneasily come and go: the\r\n      order of the day is evidently not the day’s want. Till at length,\r\n      from the outer gates, is heard a rustling and justling, shrill\r\n      uproar and squabbling, muffled by walls; which testifies that the\r\n      hour is come! Rushing and crushing one hears now; then enter\r\n      Usher Maillard, with a Deputation of Fifteen muddy dripping\r\n      Women,—having by incredible industry, and aid of all the macers,\r\n      persuaded the rest to wait out of doors. National Assembly shall\r\n      now, therefore, look its august task directly in the face:\r\n      regenerative Constitutionalism has an unregenerate Sansculottism\r\n      bodily in front of it; crying, ‘Bread! Bread!’\r\n\r\n      Shifty Maillard, translating frenzy into articulation; repressive\r\n      with the one hand, expostulative with the other, does his best;\r\n      and really, though not bred to public speaking, manages rather\r\n      well:—In the present dreadful rarity of grains, a Deputation of\r\n      Female Citizens has, as the august Assembly can discern, come out\r\n      from Paris to petition. Plots of Aristocrats are too evident in\r\n      the matter; for example, one miller has been bribed “by a\r\n      banknote of 200 livres” not to grind,—name unknown to the Usher,\r\n      but fact provable, at least indubitable. Further, it seems, the\r\n      National Cockade has been trampled on; also there are Black\r\n      Cockades, or were. All which things will not an august National\r\n      Assembly, the hope of France, take into its wise immediate\r\n      consideration?\r\n\r\n      And Menadic Hunger, impressible, crying ‘Black Cockades,’ crying\r\n      ‘Bread, Bread,’ adds, after such fashion: ‘Will it not?—Yes,\r\n      Messieurs, if a Deputation to his Majesty, for the “Acceptance\r\n      pure and simple,” seemed proper,—how much more now, for “the\r\n      afflicting situation of Paris;” for the calming of this\r\n      effervescence!’ President Mounier, with a speedy Deputation,\r\n      among whom we notice the respectable figure of Doctor Guillotin,\r\n      gets himself forthwith on march. Vice-President shall continue\r\n      the order of the day; Usher Maillard shall stay by him to repress\r\n      the women. It is four o’clock, of the miserablest afternoon, when\r\n      Mounier steps out.\r\n\r\n      O experienced Mounier, what an afternoon; the last of thy\r\n      political existence! Better had it been to “fall suddenly\r\n      unwell,” while it was yet time. For, behold, the Esplanade, over\r\n      all its spacious expanse, is covered with groups of squalid\r\n      dripping Women; of lankhaired male Rascality, armed with axes,\r\n      rusty pikes, old muskets, ironshod clubs (_batons ferrés_, which\r\n      end in knives or sword-blades, a kind of extempore\r\n      billhook);—looking nothing but hungry revolt. The rain pours:\r\n      Gardes-du-Corps go caracoling through the groups “amid hisses;”\r\n      irritating and agitating what is but dispersed here to reunite\r\n      there.\r\n\r\n      Innumerable squalid women beleaguer the President and Deputation;\r\n      insist on going with him: has not his Majesty himself, looking\r\n      from the window, sent out to ask, What we wanted? ‘Bread and\r\n      speech with the King (_Du pain, et parler au Roi_),’ that was the\r\n      answer. Twelve women are clamorously added to the Deputation; and\r\n      march with it, across the Esplanade; through dissipated groups,\r\n      caracoling Bodyguards, and the pouring rain.\r\n\r\n      President Mounier, unexpectedly augmented by Twelve Women,\r\n      copiously escorted by Hunger and Rascality, is himself mistaken\r\n      for a group: himself and his Women are dispersed by caracolers;\r\n      rally again with difficulty, among the mud.[242] Finally the\r\n      Grates are opened: the Deputation gets access, with the Twelve\r\n      Women too in it; of which latter, Five shall even see the face of\r\n      his Majesty. Let wet Menadism, in the best spirits it can expect\r\n      their return.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.VII.\r\n      At Versailles.\r\n\r\n      But already Pallas Athene (in the shape of Demoiselle Théroigne)\r\n      is busy with Flandre and the dismounted Dragoons. She, and such\r\n      women as are fittest, go through the ranks; speak with an earnest\r\n      jocosity; clasp rough troopers to their patriot bosom, crush down\r\n      spontoons and musketoons with soft arms: can a man, that were\r\n      worthy of the name of man, attack famishing patriot women?\r\n\r\n      One reads that Théroigne had bags of money, which she distributed\r\n      over Flandre:—furnished by whom? Alas, with money-bags one seldom\r\n      sits on insurrectionary cannon. Calumnious Royalism! Théroigne\r\n      had only the limited earnings of her profession of\r\n      unfortunate-female; money she had not, but brown locks, the\r\n      figure of a heathen Goddess, and an eloquent tongue and heart.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, Saint-Antoine, in groups and troops, is continually\r\n      arriving; wetted, sulky; with pikes and impromptu billhooks:\r\n      driven thus far by popular fixed-idea. So many hirsute figures\r\n      driven hither, in that manner: figures that have come to do they\r\n      know not what; figures that have come to see it done!\r\n      Distinguished among all figures, who is this, of gaunt stature,\r\n      with leaden breastplate, though a small one;[243] bushy in red\r\n      grizzled locks; nay, with long tile-beard? It is Jourdan, unjust\r\n      dealer in mules; a dealer no longer, but a Painter’s Layfigure,\r\n      playing truant this day. From the necessities of Art comes his\r\n      long tile-beard; whence his leaden breastplate (unless indeed he\r\n      were some Hawker licensed by leaden badge) may have come,—will\r\n      perhaps remain for ever a Historical Problem. Another Saul among\r\n      the people we discern: “_Père Adam_, Father Adam,” as the groups\r\n      name him; to us better known as bull-voiced Marquis Saint-Huruge;\r\n      hero of the _Veto;_ a man that has had losses, and deserved them.\r\n      The tall Marquis, emitted some days ago from limbo, looks\r\n      peripatetically on this scene, from under his umbrella, not\r\n      without interest. All which persons and things, hurled together\r\n      as we see; Pallas Athene, busy with Flandre; patriotic Versailles\r\n      National Guards, short of ammunition, and deserted by d’Estaing\r\n      their Colonel, and commanded by Lecointre their Major; then\r\n      caracoling Bodyguards, sour, dispirited, with their buckskins\r\n      wet; and finally this flowing sea of indignant Squalor,—may they\r\n      not give rise to occurrences?\r\n\r\n      Behold, however, the Twelve She-deputies return from the Château.\r\n      Without President Mounier, indeed; but radiant with joy, shouting\r\n      ‘_Life to the King and his House_.’ Apparently the news are good,\r\n      Mesdames? News of the best! Five of us were admitted to the\r\n      internal splendours, to the Royal Presence. This slim damsel,\r\n      “Louison Chabray, worker in sculpture, aged only seventeen,” as\r\n      being of the best looks and address, her we appointed speaker. On\r\n      whom, and indeed on all of us, his Majesty looked nothing but\r\n      graciousness. Nay, when Louison, addressing him, was like to\r\n      faint, he took her in his royal arms; and said gallantly, ‘It was\r\n      well worth while (_Elle en valût bien la peine_).’ Consider, O\r\n      women, what a King! His words were of comfort, and that only:\r\n      there shall be provision sent to Paris, if provision is in the\r\n      world; grains shall circulate free as air; millers shall grind,\r\n      or do worse, while their millstones endure; and nothing be left\r\n      wrong which a Restorer of French Liberty can right.\r\n\r\n      Good news these; but, to wet Menads, all too incredible! There\r\n      seems no proof, then? _Words_ of comfort are words only; which\r\n      will feed nothing. O miserable people, betrayed by Aristocrats,\r\n      who corrupt thy very messengers! In his royal arms, Mademoiselle\r\n      Louison? In his arms? Thou shameless minx, worthy of a name—that\r\n      shall be nameless! Yes, thy skin is soft: ours is rough with\r\n      hardship; and well wetted, waiting here in the rain. No children\r\n      hast thou hungry at home; only alabaster dolls, that weep not!\r\n      The traitress! To the Lanterne!—And so poor Louison Chabray, no\r\n      asseveration or shrieks availing her, fair slim damsel, late in\r\n      the arms of Royalty, has a garter round her neck, and furibund\r\n      Amazons at each end; is about to perish so,—when two Bodyguards\r\n      gallop up, indignantly dissipating; and rescue her. The\r\n      miscredited Twelve hasten back to the Château, for an “answer in\r\n      writing.”\r\n\r\n      Nay, behold, a new flight of Menads, with “M. Brunout Bastille\r\n      Volunteer,” as impressed-commandant, at the head of it. These\r\n      also will advance to the Grate of the Grand Court, and see what\r\n      is toward. Human patience, in wet buckskins, has its limits.\r\n      Bodyguard Lieutenant, M. de Savonnières, for one moment, lets his\r\n      temper, long provoked, long pent, give way. He not only\r\n      dissipates these latter Menads; but caracoles and cuts, or\r\n      indignantly flourishes, at M. Brunout, the impressed-commandant;\r\n      and, finding great relief in it, even chases him; Brunout flying\r\n      nimbly, though in a pirouette manner, and now with sword also\r\n      drawn. At which sight of wrath and victory two other Bodyguards\r\n      (for wrath is contagious, and to pent Bodyguards is so solacing)\r\n      do likewise give way; give chase, with brandished sabre, and in\r\n      the air make horrid circles. So that poor Brunout has nothing for\r\n      it but to retreat with accelerated nimbleness, through rank after\r\n      rank; Parthian-like, fencing as he flies; above all, shouting\r\n      lustily, ‘_On nous laisse assassiner_, They are getting us\r\n      assassinated?’\r\n\r\n      Shameful! Three against one! Growls come from the Lecointrian\r\n      ranks; bellowings,—lastly shots. Savonnières” arm is raised to\r\n      strike: the bullet of a Lecointrian musket shatters it; the\r\n      brandished sabre jingles down harmless. Brunout has escaped, this\r\n      duel well ended: but the wild howl of war is everywhere beginning\r\n      to pipe!\r\n\r\n      The Amazons recoil; Saint-Antoine has its cannon pointed (full of\r\n      grapeshot); thrice applies the lit flambeau; which thrice refuses\r\n      to catch,—the touchholes are so wetted; and voices cry:\r\n      ‘_Arrêtez, il n’est pas temps encore_, Stop, it is not yet\r\n      time!’[244] Messieurs of the Garde-du-Corps, ye had orders not to\r\n      fire; nevertheless two of you limp dismounted, and one war-horse\r\n      lies slain. Were it not well to draw back out of shot-range;\r\n      finally to file off,—into the interior? If in so filing off,\r\n      there did a musketoon or two discharge itself, at these armed\r\n      shopkeepers, hooting and crowing, could man wonder? Draggled are\r\n      your white cockades of an enormous size; would to Heaven they\r\n      were got exchanged for tricolor ones! Your buckskins are wet,\r\n      your hearts heavy. Go, and return not!\r\n\r\n      The Bodyguards file off, as we hint; giving and receiving shots;\r\n      drawing no life-blood; leaving boundless indignation. Some three\r\n      times in the thickening dusk, a glimpse of them is seen, at this\r\n      or the other Portal: saluted always with execrations, with the\r\n      whew of lead. Let but a Bodyguard shew face, he is hunted by\r\n      Rascality;—for instance, poor “M. de Moucheton of the Scotch\r\n      Company,” owner of the slain war-horse; and has to be smuggled\r\n      off by Versailles Captains. Or rusty firelocks belch after him,\r\n      shivering asunder his—hat. In the end, by superior Order, the\r\n      Bodyguards, all but the few on immediate duty, disappear; or as\r\n      it were abscond; and march, under cloud of night, to\r\n      Rambouillet.[245]\r\n\r\n      We remark also that the Versaillese have now got ammunition: all\r\n      afternoon, the official Person could find none; till, in these so\r\n      critical moments, a patriotic Sublieutenant set a pistol to his\r\n      ear, and would thank him to find some,—which he thereupon\r\n      succeeded in doing. Likewise that Flandre, disarmed by Pallas\r\n      Athene, says openly, it will not fight with citizens; and for\r\n      token of peace, has exchanged cartridges with the Versaillese.\r\n\r\n      Sansculottism is now among mere friends; and can “circulate\r\n      freely;” indignant at Bodyguards;—complaining also considerably\r\n      of hunger.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.VIII.\r\n      The Equal Diet.\r\n\r\n      But why lingers Mounier; returns not with his Deputation? It is\r\n      six, it is seven o’clock; and still no Mounier, no Acceptance\r\n      pure and simple.\r\n\r\n      And, behold, the dripping Menads, not now in deputation but in\r\n      mass, have penetrated into the Assembly: to the shamefullest\r\n      interruption of public speaking and order of the day. Neither\r\n      Maillard nor Vice-President can restrain them, except within wide\r\n      limits; not even, except for minutes, can the lion-voice of\r\n      Mirabeau, though they applaud it: but ever and anon they break in\r\n      upon the regeneration of France with cries of: ‘Bread; not so\r\n      much discoursing! _Du pain; pas tant de longs discours!_’—So\r\n      insensible were these poor creatures to bursts of Parliamentary\r\n      eloquence!\r\n\r\n      One learns also that the royal Carriages are getting yoked, as if\r\n      for Metz. Carriages, royal or not, have verily showed themselves\r\n      at the back Gates. They even produced, or quoted, a written order\r\n      from our Versailles Municipality,—which is a Monarchic not a\r\n      Democratic one. However, Versailles Patroles drove them in again;\r\n      as the vigilant Lecointre had strictly charged them to do.\r\n\r\n      A busy man, truly, is Major Lecointre, in these hours. For\r\n      Colonel d’Estaing loiters invisible in the Œil-de-Bœuf;\r\n      invisible, or still more questionably _visible_, for instants:\r\n      then also a too loyal Municipality requires supervision: no\r\n      order, civil or military, taken about any of these thousand\r\n      things! Lecointre is at the Versailles Townhall: he is at the\r\n      Grate of the Grand Court; communing with Swiss and Bodyguards. He\r\n      is in the ranks of Flandre; he is here, he is there: studious to\r\n      prevent bloodshed; to prevent the Royal Family from flying to\r\n      Metz; the Menads from plundering Versailles.\r\n\r\n      At the fall of night, we behold him advance to those armed groups\r\n      of Saint-Antoine, hovering all-too grim near the Salle des Menus.\r\n      They receive him in a half-circle; twelve speakers behind\r\n      cannons, with lighted torches in hand, the cannon-mouths\r\n      _towards_ Lecointre: a picture for Salvator! He asks, in\r\n      temperate but courageous language: What they, by this their\r\n      journey to Versailles, do specially want? The twelve speakers\r\n      reply, in few words inclusive of much: ‘Bread, and the end of\r\n      these brabbles, _Du pain, et la fin des affaires_.’ When the\r\n      _affairs_ will end, no Major Lecointre, nor no mortal, can say;\r\n      but as to bread, he inquires, How many are you?—learns that they\r\n      are six hundred, that a loaf each will suffice; and rides off to\r\n      the Municipality to get six hundred loaves.\r\n\r\n      Which loaves, however, a Municipality of Monarchic temper will\r\n      not give. It will give two tons of rice rather,—could you but\r\n      know whether it should be boiled or raw. Nay when this too is\r\n      accepted, the Municipals have disappeared;—ducked under, as the\r\n      Six-and-Twenty Long-gowned of Paris did; and, leaving not the\r\n      smallest vestage of rice, in the boiled or raw state, they there\r\n      vanish from History!\r\n\r\n      Rice comes not; one’s hope of food is baulked; even one’s hope of\r\n      vengeance: is not M. de Moucheton of the Scotch Company, as we\r\n      said, deceitfully smuggled off? Failing all which, behold only M.\r\n      de Moucheton’s slain warhorse, lying on the Esplanade there!\r\n      Saint-Antoine, baulked, esurient, pounces on the slain warhorse;\r\n      flays it; roasts it, with such fuel, of paling, gates, portable\r\n      timber as can be come at,—not without shouting: and, after the\r\n      manner of ancient Greek Heroes, _they lifted their hands to the\r\n      daintily readied repast;_ such as it might be.[246] Other\r\n      Rascality prowls discursive; seeking what it may devour. Flandre\r\n      will retire to its barracks; Lecointre also with his\r\n      Versaillese,—all but the vigilant Patrols, charged to be doubly\r\n      vigilant.\r\n\r\n      So sink the shadows of Night, blustering, rainy; and all paths\r\n      grow dark. Strangest Night ever seen in these regions,—perhaps\r\n      since the Bartholomew Night, when Versailles, as Bassompierre\r\n      writes of it, was a _chétif château_. O for the Lyre of some\r\n      Orpheus, to constrain, with touch of melodious strings, these mad\r\n      masses into Order! For here all seems fallen asunder, in\r\n      wide-yawning dislocation. The highest, as in down-rushing of a\r\n      World, is come in contact with the lowest: the Rascality of\r\n      France beleaguering the Royalty of France; “ironshod batons”\r\n      lifted round the diadem, not to guard it! With denunciations of\r\n      bloodthirsty Anti-national Bodyguards, are heard dark growlings\r\n      against a Queenly Name.\r\n\r\n      The Court sits tremulous, powerless; varies with the varying\r\n      temper of the Esplanade, with the varying colour of the rumours\r\n      from Paris. Thick-coming rumours; now of peace, now of war.\r\n      Necker and all the Ministers consult; with a blank issue. The\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf is one tempest of whispers:—We will fly to Metz; we\r\n      will not fly. The royal Carriages again attempt egress;—though\r\n      for trial merely; they are again driven in by Lecointre’s\r\n      Patrols. In six hours, nothing has been resolved on; not even the\r\n      Acceptance pure and simple.\r\n\r\n      In six hours? Alas, he who, in such circumstances, cannot resolve\r\n      in six minutes, may give up the enterprise: him Fate has already\r\n      resolved for. And Menadism, meanwhile, and Sansculottism takes\r\n      counsel with the National Assembly; grows more and more\r\n      tumultuous there. Mounier returns not; Authority nowhere shews\r\n      itself: the Authority of France lies, for the present, with\r\n      Lecointre and Usher Maillard.—This then is the abomination of\r\n      desolation; come suddenly, though long foreshadowed as\r\n      inevitable! For, to the blind, all things are sudden. Misery\r\n      which, through long ages, had no spokesman, no helper, will now\r\n      be its own helper and speak for itself. The dialect, one of the\r\n      rudest, is, what it could be, _this_.\r\n\r\n      At eight o’clock there returns to our Assembly not the\r\n      Deputation; but Doctor Guillotin announcing that it will return;\r\n      also that there is hope of the Acceptance pure and simple. He\r\n      himself has brought a Royal Letter, authorising and commanding\r\n      the freest “circulation of grains.” Which Royal Letter Menadism\r\n      with its whole heart applauds. Conformably to which the Assembly\r\n      forthwith passes a Decree; also received with rapturous Menadic\r\n      plaudits:—Only could not an august Assembly contrive further to\r\n      ‘_fix_ the price of bread at eight sous the half-quartern;\r\n      butchers’-meat at six sous the pound;’ which seem fair rates?\r\n      Such motion do “a multitude of men and women,” irrepressible by\r\n      Usher Maillard, now make; does an august Assembly hear made.\r\n      Usher Maillard himself is not always perfectly measured in\r\n      speech; but if rebuked, he can justly excuse himself by the\r\n      peculiarity of the circumstances.[247]\r\n\r\n      But finally, this Decree well passed, and the disorder\r\n      continuing; and Members melting away, and no President Mounier\r\n      returning,—what can the Vice-President do but also melt away? The\r\n      Assembly melts, under such pressure, into deliquium; or, as it is\r\n      officially called, adjourns. Maillard is despatched to Paris,\r\n      with the “Decree concerning Grains” in his pocket; he and some\r\n      women, in carriages belonging to the King. Thitherward slim\r\n      Louison Chabray has already set forth, with that “written\r\n      answer,” which the Twelve She-deputies returned in to seek. Slim\r\n      sylph, she has set forth, through the black muddy country: she\r\n      has much to tell, her poor nerves so flurried; and travels, as\r\n      indeed today on this road all persons do, with extreme slowness.\r\n      President Mounier has not come, nor the Acceptance pure and\r\n      simple; though six hours with their events have come; though\r\n      courier on courier reports that Lafayette is coming. Coming, with\r\n      war or with peace? It is time that the Château also should\r\n      determine on one thing or another; that the Château also should\r\n      show itself alive, if it would continue living!\r\n\r\n      Victorious, joyful after such delay, Mounier does arrive at last,\r\n      and the hard-earned Acceptance with him; which now, alas, is of\r\n      small value. Fancy Mounier’s surprise to find his Senate, whom he\r\n      hoped to charm by the Acceptance pure and simple,—all gone; and\r\n      in its stead a Senate of Menads! For as Erasmus’s Ape mimicked,\r\n      say with wooden splint, Erasmus shaving, so do these Amazons\r\n      hold, in mock majesty, some confused parody of National Assembly.\r\n      They make motions; deliver speeches; pass enactments; productive\r\n      at least of loud laughter. All galleries and benches are filled;\r\n      a strong Dame of the Market is in Mounier’s Chair. Not without\r\n      difficulty, Mounier, by aid of macers, and persuasive speaking,\r\n      makes his way to the Female-President: the Strong Dame before\r\n      abdicating signifies that, for one thing, she and indeed her\r\n      whole senate male and female (for what was one roasted warhorse\r\n      among so many?) are suffering very considerably from hunger.\r\n\r\n      Experienced Mounier, in these circumstances, takes a twofold\r\n      resolution: To reconvoke his Assembly Members by sound of drum;\r\n      also to procure a supply of food. Swift messengers fly, to all\r\n      bakers, cooks, pastrycooks, vintners, restorers; drums beat,\r\n      accompanied with shrill vocal proclamation, through all streets.\r\n      They come: the Assembly Members come; what is still better, the\r\n      provisions come. On tray and barrow come these latter; loaves,\r\n      wine, great store of sausages. The nourishing baskets circulate\r\n      harmoniously along the benches; nor, according to the Father of\r\n      Epics, _did any soul lack a fair share of victual_ (δαῖτος\r\n      ὲἱσης), _an equal diet_); highly desirable, at the moment.[248]\r\n\r\n      Gradually some hundred or so of Assembly members get edged in,\r\n      Menadism making way a little, round Mounier’s Chair; listen to\r\n      the Acceptance pure and simple; and begin, what is the order of\r\n      the night, “discussion of the Penal Code.” All benches are\r\n      crowded; in the dusky galleries, duskier with unwashed heads, is\r\n      a strange “coruscation,”—of impromptu billhooks.[249] It is\r\n      exactly five months this day since these same galleries were\r\n      filled with high-plumed jewelled Beauty, raining bright\r\n      influences; and now? To such length have we got in regenerating\r\n      France. Methinks the travail-throes are of the sharpest!—Menadism\r\n      will not be restrained from occasional remarks; asks, ‘What is\r\n      use of the Penal Code? The thing we want is Bread.’ Mirabeau\r\n      turns round with lion-voiced rebuke; Menadism applauds him; but\r\n      recommences.\r\n\r\n      Thus they, chewing tough sausages, discussing the Penal Code,\r\n      make night hideous. What the issue will be? Lafayette with his\r\n      thirty thousand must arrive first: him, who cannot now be\r\n      distant, all men expect, as the messenger of Destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.IX.\r\n      Lafayette.\r\n\r\n      Towards midnight lights flare on the hill; Lafayette’s lights!\r\n      The roll of his drums comes up the Avenue de Versailles. With\r\n      peace, or with war? Patience, friends! With neither. Lafayette is\r\n      come, but not yet the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n      He has halted and harangued so often, on the march; spent nine\r\n      hours on four leagues of road. At Montreuil, close on Versailles,\r\n      the whole Host had to pause; and, with uplifted right hand, in\r\n      the murk of Night, to these pouring skies, swear solemnly to\r\n      respect the King’s Dwelling; to be faithful to King and National\r\n      Assembly. Rage is driven down out of sight, by the laggard march;\r\n      the thirst of vengeance slaked in weariness and soaking clothes.\r\n      Flandre is again drawn out under arms: but Flandre, grown so\r\n      patriotic, now needs no “exterminating.” The wayworn Batallions\r\n      halt in the Avenue: they have, for the present, no wish so\r\n      pressing as that of shelter and rest.\r\n\r\n      Anxious sits President Mounier; anxious the Château. There is a\r\n      message coming from the Château, that M. Mounier would please\r\n      return thither with a fresh Deputation, swiftly; and so at least\r\n      _unite_ our two anxieties. Anxious Mounier does of himself send,\r\n      meanwhile, to apprise the General that his Majesty has been so\r\n      gracious as to grant us the Acceptance pure and simple. The\r\n      General, with a small advance column, makes answer in passing;\r\n      speaks vaguely some smooth words to the National\r\n      President,—glances, only with the eye, at that so mixtiform\r\n      National Assembly; then fares forward towards the Château. There\r\n      are with him two Paris Municipals; they were chosen from the\r\n      Three Hundred for that errand. He gets admittance through the\r\n      locked and padlocked Grates, through sentries and ushers, to the\r\n      Royal Halls.\r\n\r\n      The Court, male and female, crowds on his passage, to read their\r\n      doom on his face; which exhibits, say Historians, a mixture “of\r\n      sorrow, of fervour and valour,” singular to behold.[250] The\r\n      King, with Monsieur, with Ministers and Marshals, is waiting to\r\n      receive him: He ‘is come,’ in his highflown chivalrous way, ‘to\r\n      offer his head for the safety of his Majesty’s.’ The two\r\n      Municipals state the wish of Paris: four things, of quite pacific\r\n      tenor. First, that the honour of Guarding his sacred person be\r\n      conferred on patriot National Guards;—say, the Centre Grenadiers,\r\n      who as Gardes Françaises were wont to have that privilege.\r\n      Second, that provisions be got, if possible. Third, that the\r\n      Prisons, all crowded with political delinquents, may have judges\r\n      sent them. Fourth, _that it would please his Majesty to come and\r\n      live in Paris._ To all which four wishes, except the fourth, his\r\n      Majesty answers readily, Yes; or indeed may almost say that he\r\n      has already answered it. To the fourth he can answer only, Yes or\r\n      No; would so gladly answer, Yes _and_ No!—But, in any case, are\r\n      not their dispositions, thank Heaven, so entirely pacific? There\r\n      is time for deliberation. The brunt of the danger seems past!\r\n\r\n      Lafayette and d’Estaing settle the watches; Centre Grenadiers are\r\n      to take the Guard-room they of old occupied as Gardes\r\n      Françaises;—for indeed the Gardes du Corps, its late ill-advised\r\n      occupants, are gone mostly to Rambouillet. That is the order of\r\n      _this_ night; sufficient for the night is the evil thereof.\r\n      Whereupon Lafayette and the two Municipals, with highflown\r\n      chivalry, take their leave.\r\n\r\n      So brief has the interview been, Mounier and his Deputation were\r\n      not yet got up. So brief and satisfactory. A stone is rolled from\r\n      every heart. The fair Palace Dames publicly declare that this\r\n      Lafayette, detestable though he be, is their saviour for once.\r\n      Even the ancient vinaigrous _Tantes_ admit it; the King’s Aunts,\r\n      ancient _Graille_ and Sisterhood, known to us of old. Queen\r\n      Marie-Antoinette has been heard often say the like. She alone,\r\n      among all women and all men, wore a face of courage, of lofty\r\n      calmness and resolve, this day. She alone saw clearly what she\r\n      _meant_ to do; and Theresa’s Daughter _dares_ do what she means,\r\n      were all France threatening her: abide where her children are,\r\n      where her husband is.\r\n\r\n      Towards three in the morning all things are settled: the watches\r\n      set, the Centre Grenadiers put into their old Guard-room, and\r\n      harangued; the Swiss, and few remaining Bodyguards harangued. The\r\n      wayworn Paris Batallions, consigned to “the hospitality of\r\n      Versailles,” lie dormant in spare-beds, spare-barracks,\r\n      coffeehouses, empty churches. A troop of them, on their way to\r\n      the Church of Saint-Louis, awoke poor Weber, dreaming troublous,\r\n      in the Rue Sartory. Weber has had his waistcoat-pocket full of\r\n      balls all day; “two hundred balls, and two _pears_ of powder!”\r\n      For waistcoats were waistcoats then, and had flaps down to\r\n      mid-thigh. So many balls he has had all day; but no opportunity\r\n      of using them: he turns over now, execrating disloyal bandits;\r\n      swears a prayer or two, and straight to sleep again.\r\n\r\n      Finally, the National Assembly is harangued; which thereupon, on\r\n      motion of Mirabeau, discontinues the Penal Code, and dismisses\r\n      for this night. Menadism, Sansculottism has cowered into\r\n      guard-houses, barracks of Flandre, to the light of cheerful fire;\r\n      failing that, to churches, office-houses, sentry-boxes,\r\n      wheresoever wretchedness can find a lair. The troublous Day has\r\n      brawled itself to rest: no lives yet lost but that of one\r\n      warhorse. Insurrectionary Chaos lies slumbering round the Palace,\r\n      like Ocean round a Diving-bell,—no crevice yet disclosing itself.\r\n\r\n      Deep sleep has fallen promiscuously on the high and on the low;\r\n      suspending most things, even wrath and famine. Darkness covers\r\n      the Earth. But, far on the North-east, Paris flings up her great\r\n      yellow gleam; far into the wet black Night. For all is\r\n      illuminated there, as in the old July Nights; the streets\r\n      deserted, for alarm of war; the Municipals all wakeful; Patrols\r\n      hailing, with their hoarse _Who-goes_. There, as we discover, our\r\n      poor slim Louison Chabray, her poor nerves all fluttered, is\r\n      arriving about this very hour. There Usher Maillard will arrive,\r\n      about an hour hence, “towards four in the morning.” They report,\r\n      successively, to a wakeful Hôtel-de-Ville what comfort they can\r\n      report; which again, with early dawn, large comfortable Placards,\r\n      shall impart to all men.\r\n\r\n      Lafayette, in the Hôtel de Noailles, not far from the Château,\r\n      having now finished haranguing, sits with his Officers\r\n      consulting: at five o’clock the unanimous best counsel is, that a\r\n      man so tost and toiled for twenty-four hours and more, fling\r\n      himself on a bed, and seek some rest.\r\n\r\n      Thus, then, has ended the First Act of the Insurrection of Women.\r\n      How it will turn on the morrow? The morrow, as always, is with\r\n      the Fates! But his Majesty, one may hope, will consent to come\r\n      honourably to Paris; at all events, he can visit Paris.\r\n      Anti-national Bodyguards, here and elsewhere, must take the\r\n      National Oath; make reparation to the Tricolor; Flandre will\r\n      swear. There may be much swearing; much public speaking there\r\n      will infallibly be: and so, with harangues and vows, may the\r\n      matter in some handsome way, wind itself up.\r\n\r\n      Or, alas, may it not be all otherwise, unhandsome: the consent\r\n      not honourable, but extorted, ignominious? Boundless Chaos of\r\n      Insurrection presses slumbering round the Palace, like Ocean\r\n      round a Diving-bell; and may penetrate at any crevice. Let but\r\n      that accumulated insurrectionary mass find entrance! Like the\r\n      infinite inburst of water; or say rather, of inflammable,\r\n      self-igniting fluid; for example, “turpentine-and-phosphorus\r\n      oil,”—fluid known to Spinola Santerre!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.X.\r\n      The Grand Entries.\r\n\r\n      The dull dawn of a new morning, drizzly and chill, had but broken\r\n      over Versailles, when it pleased Destiny that a Bodyguard should\r\n      look out of window, on the right wing of the Château, to see what\r\n      prospect there was in Heaven and in Earth. Rascality male and\r\n      female is prowling in view of him. His fasting stomach is, with\r\n      good cause, sour; he perhaps cannot forbear a passing malison on\r\n      them; least of all can he forbear answering such.\r\n\r\n      Ill words breed worse: till the worst word came; and then the ill\r\n      deed. Did the maledicent Bodyguard, getting (as was too\r\n      inevitable) better malediction than he gave, load his musketoon,\r\n      and threaten to fire; and actually fire? Were wise who wist! It\r\n      stands asserted; to us not credibly. Be this as it may, menaced\r\n      Rascality, in whinnying scorn, is shaking at all Grates: the\r\n      fastening of one (some write, it was a chain merely) gives way;\r\n      Rascality is in the Grand Court, whinnying louder still.\r\n\r\n      The maledicent Bodyguard, more Bodyguards than he do now give\r\n      fire; a man’s arm is shattered. Lecointre will depose[251] that\r\n      “the Sieur Cardaine, a National Guard without arms, was stabbed.”\r\n      But see, sure enough, poor Jerôme l’Héritier, an unarmed National\r\n      Guard he too, “cabinet-maker, a saddler’s son, of Paris,” with\r\n      the down of youthhood still on his chin,—he reels death-stricken;\r\n      rushes to the pavement, scattering it with his blood and\r\n      brains!—Allelew! Wilder than Irish wakes, rises the howl: of\r\n      pity; of infinite revenge. In few moments, the Grate of the inner\r\n      and inmost Court, which they name Court of Marble, this too is\r\n      forced, or surprised, and burst open: the Court of Marble too is\r\n      overflowed: up the Grand Staircase, up all stairs and entrances\r\n      rushes the living Deluge! Deshuttes and Varigny, the two sentry\r\n      Bodyguards, are trodden down, are massacred with a hundred pikes.\r\n      Women snatch their cutlasses, or any weapon, and storm-in\r\n      Menadic:—other women lift the corpse of shot Jerôme; lay it down\r\n      on the Marble steps; there shall the livid face and smashed head,\r\n      dumb for ever, _speak_.\r\n\r\n      Wo now to all Bodyguards, mercy is none for them! Miomandre de\r\n      Sainte-Marie pleads with soft words, on the Grand Staircase,\r\n      “descending four steps:”—to the roaring tornado. His comrades\r\n      snatch him up, by the skirts and belts; literally, from the jaws\r\n      of Destruction; and slam-to their Door. This also will stand few\r\n      instants; the panels shivering in, like potsherds. Barricading\r\n      serves not: fly fast, ye Bodyguards; rabid Insurrection, like the\r\n      hellhound Chase, uproaring at your heels!\r\n\r\n      The terrorstruck Bodyguards fly, bolting and barricading; it\r\n      follows. Whitherward? Through hall on hall: wo, now! towards the\r\n      Queen’s Suite of Rooms, in the furtherest room of which the Queen\r\n      is now asleep. Five sentinels rush through that long Suite; they\r\n      are in the Anteroom knocking loud: ‘Save the Queen!’ Trembling\r\n      women fall at their feet with tears; are answered: ‘Yes, we will\r\n      die; save ye the Queen!’\r\n\r\n      Tremble not, women, but haste: for, lo, another voice shouts far\r\n      through the outermost door, ‘Save the Queen!’ and the door shut.\r\n      It is brave Miomandre’s voice that shouts this second warning. He\r\n      has stormed across imminent death to do it; fronts imminent\r\n      death, having done it. Brave Tardivet du Repaire, bent on the\r\n      same desperate service, was borne down with pikes; his comrades\r\n      hardly snatched him in again alive. Miomandre and Tardivet: let\r\n      the names of these two Bodyguards, as the names of brave men\r\n      should, live long.\r\n\r\n      Trembling Maids of Honour, one of whom from afar caught glimpse\r\n      of Miomandre as well as heard him, hastily wrap the Queen; not in\r\n      robes of State. She flies for her life, across the Œil-de-Bœuf;\r\n      against the main door of which too Insurrection batters. She is\r\n      in the King’s Apartment, in the King’s arms; she clasps her\r\n      children amid a faithful few. The Imperial-hearted bursts into\r\n      mother’s tears: ‘O my friends, save me and my children, _O mes\r\n      amis, sauvez moi et mes enfans!_’ The battering of\r\n      Insurrectionary axes clangs audible across the Œil-de-Bœuf. What\r\n      an hour!\r\n\r\n      Yes, Friends: a hideous fearful hour; shameful alike to Governed\r\n      and Governor; wherein Governed and Governor ignominiously testify\r\n      that their relation is at an end. Rage, which had brewed itself\r\n      in twenty thousand hearts, for the last four-and-twenty hours,\r\n      has taken fire: Jerome’s brained corpse lies there as live-coal.\r\n      It is, as we said, the infinite Element bursting in: wild-surging\r\n      through all corridors and conduits.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, the poor Bodyguards have got hunted mostly into the\r\n      Œil-de-Bœuf. They may die there, at the King’s threshhold; they\r\n      can do little to defend it. They are heaping _tabourets_ (stools\r\n      of honour), benches and all moveables, against the door; at which\r\n      the axe of Insurrection thunders.—But did brave Miomandre perish,\r\n      then, at the Queen’s door? No, he was fractured, slashed,\r\n      lacerated, left for dead; he has nevertheless crawled hither; and\r\n      shall live, honoured of loyal France. Remark also, in flat\r\n      contradiction to much which has been said and sung, that\r\n      Insurrection did _not_ burst that door he had defended; but\r\n      hurried elsewhither, seeking new bodyguards.[252]\r\n\r\n      Poor Bodyguards, with their Thyestes’ Opera-Repast! Well for\r\n      them, that Insurrection has only pikes and axes; no right sieging\r\n      tools! It shakes and thunders. Must they all perish miserably,\r\n      and Royalty with them? Deshuttes and Varigny, massacred at the\r\n      first inbreak, have been beheaded in the Marble Court: a\r\n      sacrifice to Jerôme’s _manes:_ Jourdan with the tile-beard did\r\n      that duty willingly; and asked, If there were no more? Another\r\n      captive they are leading round the corpse, with howl-chauntings:\r\n      may not Jourdan again tuck up his sleeves?\r\n\r\n      And louder and louder rages Insurrection within, plundering if it\r\n      cannot kill; louder and louder it thunders at the Œil-de-Bœuf:\r\n      what can now hinder its bursting in?—On a sudden it ceases; the\r\n      battering has ceased! Wild rushing: the cries grow fainter: there\r\n      is silence, or the tramp of regular steps; then a friendly\r\n      knocking: ‘We are the Centre Grenadiers, old Gardes Françaises:\r\n      Open to us, Messieurs of the Garde-du-Corps; we have not\r\n      forgotten how you saved us at Fontenoy!’[253] The door is opened;\r\n      enter Captain Gondran and the Centre Grenadiers: there are\r\n      military embracings; there is sudden deliverance from death into\r\n      life.\r\n\r\n      Strange Sons of Adam! It was to “exterminate” these\r\n      Gardes-du-Corps that the Centre Grenadiers left home: and now\r\n      they have rushed to save them from extermination. The memory of\r\n      common peril, of old help, melts the rough heart; bosom is\r\n      clasped to bosom, not in war. The King shews himself, one moment,\r\n      through the door of his Apartment, with: ‘Do not hurt my\r\n      Guards!’—‘_Soyons frères_, Let us be brothers!’ cries Captain\r\n      Gondran; and again dashes off, with levelled bayonets, to sweep\r\n      the Palace clear.\r\n\r\n      Now too Lafayette, suddenly roused, not from sleep (for his eyes\r\n      had not yet closed), arrives; with passionate popular eloquence,\r\n      with prompt military word of command. National Guards, suddenly\r\n      roused, by sound of trumpet and alarm-drum, are all arriving. The\r\n      death-melly ceases: the first sky-lambent blaze of Insurrection\r\n      is got damped down; it burns now, if unextinguished, yet\r\n      flameless, as charred coals do, and not inextinguishable. The\r\n      King’s Apartments are safe. Ministers, Officials, and even some\r\n      loyal National deputies are assembling round their Majesties. The\r\n      consternation will, with sobs and confusion, settle down\r\n      gradually, into plan and counsel, better or worse.\r\n\r\n      But glance now, for a moment, from the royal windows! A roaring\r\n      sea of human heads, inundating both Courts; billowing against all\r\n      passages: Menadic women; infuriated men, mad with revenge, with\r\n      love of mischief, love of plunder! Rascality has slipped its\r\n      muzzle; and now bays, three-throated, like the Dog of Erebus.\r\n      Fourteen Bodyguards are wounded; two massacred, and as we saw,\r\n      beheaded; Jourdan asking, ‘Was it worth while to come so far for\r\n      two?’ Hapless Deshuttes and Varigny! Their fate surely was sad.\r\n      Whirled down so suddenly to the abyss; as men are, suddenly, by\r\n      the wide thunder of the Mountain Avalanche, awakened not by\r\n      _them_, awakened far off by others! When the Château Clock last\r\n      struck, they two were pacing languid, with poised musketoon;\r\n      anxious mainly that the next hour would strike. It has struck; to\r\n      them inaudible. Their trunks lie mangled: their heads parade, “on\r\n      pikes twelve feet long,” through the streets of Versailles; and\r\n      shall, about noon reach the Barriers of Paris,—a too ghastly\r\n      contradiction to the large comfortable Placards that have been\r\n      posted there!\r\n\r\n      The other captive Bodyguard is still circling the corpse of\r\n      Jerome, amid Indian war-whooping; bloody Tilebeard, with tucked\r\n      sleeves, brandishing his bloody axe; when Gondran and the\r\n      Grenadiers come in sight. ‘Comrades, will you see a man massacred\r\n      in cold blood?’—‘Off, butchers!’ answer they; and the poor\r\n      Bodyguard is free. Busy runs Gondran, busy run Guards and\r\n      Captains; scouring at all corridors; dispersing Rascality and\r\n      Robbery; sweeping the Palace clear. The mangled carnage is\r\n      removed; Jerome’s body to the Townhall, for inquest: the fire of\r\n      Insurrection gets damped, more and more, into measurable,\r\n      manageable heat.\r\n\r\n      Transcendent things of all sorts, as in the general outburst of\r\n      multitudinous Passion, are huddled together; the ludicrous, nay\r\n      the ridiculous, with the horrible. Far over the billowy sea of\r\n      heads, may be seen Rascality, caprioling on horses from the Royal\r\n      Stud. The Spoilers these; for Patriotism is always infected so,\r\n      with a proportion of mere thieves and scoundrels. Gondran\r\n      snatched their prey from them in the Château; whereupon they\r\n      hurried to the Stables, and took horse there. But the generous\r\n      Diomedes’ steeds, according to Weber, disdained such\r\n      scoundrel-burden; and, flinging up their royal heels, did soon\r\n      project most of it, in parabolic curves, to a distance, amid\r\n      peals of laughter: and were caught. Mounted National Guards\r\n      secured the rest.\r\n\r\n      Now too is witnessed the touching last-flicker of Etiquette;\r\n      which sinks not here, in the Cimmerian World-wreckage, without a\r\n      sign, as the house-cricket might still chirp in the pealing of a\r\n      Trump of Doom. ‘Monsieur,’ said some Master of Ceremonies (one\r\n      hopes it might be de Brézé), as Lafayette, in these fearful\r\n      moments, was rushing towards the inner Royal Apartments,\r\n      ‘_Monsieur, le Roi vous accorde les grandes entrées_, Monsieur,\r\n      the King grants you the Grand Entries,’—not finding it convenient\r\n      to refuse them![254]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 1.7.XI.\r\n      From Versailles.\r\n\r\n      However, the Paris National Guard, wholly under arms, has cleared\r\n      the Palace, and even occupies the nearer external spaces;\r\n      extruding miscellaneous Patriotism, for most part, into the Grand\r\n      Court, or even into the Forecourt.\r\n\r\n      The Bodyguards, you can observe, have now of a verity, “hoisted\r\n      the National Cockade:” for they step forward to the windows or\r\n      balconies, hat aloft in hand, on each hat a huge tricolor; and\r\n      fling over their bandoleers in sign of surrender; and shout _Vive\r\n      la Nation_. To which how can the generous heart respond but with,\r\n      _Vive le Roi; vivent les Gardes-du-Corps?_ His Majesty himself\r\n      has appeared with Lafayette on the balcony, and again appears:\r\n      _Vive le Roi_ greets him from all throats; but also from some one\r\n      throat is heard ‘_Le Roi à Paris_, The King to Paris!’\r\n\r\n      Her Majesty too, on demand, shows herself, though there is peril\r\n      in it: she steps out on the balcony, with her little boy and\r\n      girl. ‘No children, _Point d’enfans!_’ cry the voices. She gently\r\n      pushes back her children; and stands alone, her hands serenely\r\n      crossed on her breast: ‘should I die,’ she had said, ‘I will do\r\n      it.’ Such serenity of heroism has its effect. Lafayette, with\r\n      ready wit, in his highflown chivalrous way, takes that fair\r\n      queenly hand; and reverently kneeling, kisses it: thereupon the\r\n      people do shout _Vive la Reine_. Nevertheless, poor Weber “saw”\r\n      (or even thought he saw; for hardly the third part of poor\r\n      Weber’s experiences, in such hysterical days, will stand\r\n      scrutiny) “one of these brigands level his musket at her\r\n      Majesty,”—with or without intention to shoot; for another of the\r\n      brigands “angrily struck it down.”\r\n\r\n      So that all, and the Queen herself, nay the very Captain of the\r\n      Bodyguards, have grown National! The very Captain of the\r\n      Bodyguards steps out now with Lafayette. On the hat of the\r\n      repentant man is an enormous tricolor; large as a soup-platter,\r\n      or sun-flower; visible to the utmost Forecourt. He takes the\r\n      National Oath with a loud voice, elevating his hat; at which\r\n      sight all the army raise their bonnets on their bayonets, with\r\n      shouts. Sweet is reconcilement to the heart of man. Lafayette has\r\n      sworn Flandre; he swears the remaining Bodyguards, down in the\r\n      Marble Court; the people clasp them in their arms:—O, my\r\n      brothers, why would ye force us to slay you? Behold there is joy\r\n      over you, as over returning prodigal sons!—The poor Bodyguards,\r\n      now National and tricolor, exchange bonnets, exchange arms; there\r\n      shall be peace and fraternity. And still ‘_Vive le Roi;_’ and\r\n      also ‘_Le Roi à Paris_,’ not now from one throat, but from all\r\n      throats as one, for it is the heart’s wish of all mortals.\r\n\r\n      Yes, _The King to Paris:_ what else? Ministers may consult, and\r\n      National Deputies wag their heads: but there is now no other\r\n      possibility. You have forced him to go willingly. ‘At one\r\n      o’clock!’ Lafayette gives audible assurance to that purpose; and\r\n      universal Insurrection, with immeasurable shout, and a discharge\r\n      of all the firearms, clear and rusty, great and small, that it\r\n      has, returns him acceptance. What a sound; heard for leagues: a\r\n      doom peal!—That sound too rolls away, into the Silence of Ages.\r\n      And the Château of Versailles stands ever since vacant, hushed\r\n      still; its spacious Courts grassgrown, responsive to the hoe of\r\n      the weeder. Times and generations roll on, in their confused\r\n      Gulf-current; and buildings like builders have their destiny.\r\n\r\n      Till one o’clock, then, there will be three parties, National\r\n      Assembly, National Rascality, National Royalty, all busy enough.\r\n      Rascality rejoices; women trim themselves with tricolor. Nay\r\n      motherly Paris has sent her Avengers sufficient “cartloads of\r\n      loaves;” which are shouted over, which are gratefully consumed.\r\n      The Avengers, in return, are searching for grain-stores; loading\r\n      them in fifty waggons; that so a National King, probable\r\n      harbinger of all blessings, may be the evident bringer of plenty,\r\n      for one.\r\n\r\n      And thus has Sansculottism made prisoner its King; _revoking_ his\r\n      parole. The Monarchy has fallen; and not so much as honourably:\r\n      no, ignominiously; with struggle, indeed, oft repeated; but then\r\n      with unwise struggle; wasting its strength in fits and paroxysms;\r\n      at every new paroxysm, foiled more pitifully than before. Thus\r\n      Broglie’s whiff of grapeshot, which might have been something,\r\n      has dwindled to the pot-valour of an Opera Repast, and _O\r\n      Richard, O mon Roi_. Which again we shall see dwindle to a\r\n      Favras’ Conspiracy, a thing to be settled by the hanging of one\r\n      Chevalier.\r\n\r\n      Poor Monarchy! But what save foulest defeat can await that man,\r\n      who wills, and yet wills not? Apparently the King either has a\r\n      right, assertible as such to the death, before God and man; or\r\n      else he has no right. Apparently, the one or the other; could he\r\n      but know which! May Heaven pity him! Were Louis wise he would\r\n      this day abdicate.—Is it not strange so few Kings abdicate; and\r\n      none yet heard of has been known to commit suicide? Fritz the\r\n      First, of Prussia, alone tried it; and they cut the rope.[255]\r\n\r\n      As for the National Assembly, which decrees this morning that it\r\n      “is inseparable from his Majesty,” and will follow him to Paris,\r\n      there may one thing be noted: its extreme want of bodily health.\r\n      After the Fourteenth of July there was a certain sickliness\r\n      observable among honourable Members; so many demanding passports,\r\n      on account of infirm health. But now, for these following days,\r\n      there is a perfect murrian: President Mounier, Lally Tollendal,\r\n      Clermont Tonnere, and all Constitutional Two-Chamber Royalists\r\n      needing change of air; as most No-Chamber Royalists had formerly\r\n      done.\r\n\r\n      For, in truth, it is the _second Emigration_ this that has now\r\n      come; most extensive among Commons Deputies, Noblesse, Clergy: so\r\n      that “to Switzerland alone there go sixty thousand.” They will\r\n      return in the day of accounts! Yes, and have hot welcome.—But\r\n      Emigration on Emigration is the peculiarity of France. One\r\n      Emigration follows another; grounded on reasonable fear,\r\n      unreasonable hope, largely also on childish pet. The highflyers\r\n      have gone first, now the lower flyers; and ever the lower will go\r\n      down to the crawlers. Whereby, however, cannot our National\r\n      Assembly so much the more commodiously make the Constitution;\r\n      your Two-Chamber Anglomaniacs being all safe, distant on foreign\r\n      shores? Abbé Maury is seized, and sent back again: he, tough as\r\n      tanned leather, with eloquent Captain Cazalès and some others,\r\n      will stand it out for another year.\r\n\r\n      But here, meanwhile, the question arises: Was Philippe d’Orléans\r\n      seen, this day, “in the Bois de Boulogne, in grey surtout;”\r\n      waiting under the wet sere foliage, what the day might bring\r\n      forth? Alas, yes, the Eidolon of him was,—in Weber’s and other\r\n      such brains. The Chatelet shall make large inquisition into the\r\n      matter, examining a hundred and seventy witnesses, and Deputy\r\n      Chabroud publish his Report; but disclose nothing _farther_.[256]\r\n      What then has caused these two unparalleled October Days? For\r\n      surely such dramatic exhibition never yet enacted itself without\r\n      Dramatist and Machinist. Wooden Punch emerges not, with his\r\n      domestic sorrows, into the light of day, unless the wire be\r\n      pulled: how can human mobs? Was it not d’Orléans then, and\r\n      Laclos, Marquis Sillery, Mirabeau and the sons of confusion,\r\n      hoping to drive the King to Metz, and gather the spoil? Nay was\r\n      it not, quite contrariwise, the Œil-de-Bœuf, Bodyguard Colonel de\r\n      Guiche, Minister Saint-Priest and highflying Loyalists; hoping\r\n      also to drive him to Metz; and try it by the sword of civil war?\r\n      Good Marquis Toulongeon, the Historian and Deputy, feels\r\n      constrained to admit that it was _both_.[257]\r\n\r\n      Alas, my Friends, credulous incredulity is a strange matter. But\r\n      when a whole Nation is smitten with Suspicion, and sees a\r\n      dramatic miracle in the very operation of the gastric juices,\r\n      what help is there? Such Nation is already a mere hypochondriac\r\n      bundle of diseases; as good as changed into glass; atrabiliar,\r\n      decadent; and will suffer crises. Is not Suspicion itself the one\r\n      thing to be suspected, as Montaigne feared only fear?\r\n\r\n      Now, however, the short hour has struck. His Majesty is in his\r\n      carriage, with his Queen, sister Elizabeth, and two royal\r\n      children. Not for another hour can the infinite Procession get\r\n      marshalled, and under way. The weather is dim drizzling; the mind\r\n      confused; and noise great.\r\n\r\n      Processional marches not a few our world has seen; Roman triumphs\r\n      and ovations, Cabiric cymbal-beatings, Royal progresses, Irish\r\n      funerals: but this of the French Monarchy marching to its bed\r\n      remained to be seen. Miles long, and of breadth losing itself in\r\n      vagueness, for all the neighbouring country crowds to see. Slow;\r\n      stagnating along, like shoreless Lake, yet with a noise like\r\n      Niagara, like Babel and Bedlam. A splashing and a tramping; a\r\n      hurrahing, uproaring, musket-volleying;—the truest segment of\r\n      Chaos seen in these latter Ages! Till slowly it disembogue\r\n      itself, in the thickening dusk, into expectant Paris, through a\r\n      double row of faces all the way from Passy to the Hôtel-de-Ville.\r\n\r\n      Consider this: Vanguard of National troops; with trains of\r\n      artillery; of pikemen and pikewomen, mounted on cannons, on\r\n      carts, hackney-coaches, or on foot;—tripudiating, in tricolor\r\n      ribbons from head to heel; loaves stuck on the points of\r\n      bayonets, green boughs stuck in gun barrels.[258] Next, as\r\n      main-march, “fifty cartloads of corn,” which have been lent, for\r\n      peace, from the stores of Versailles. Behind which follow\r\n      stragglers of the Garde-du-Corps; all humiliated, in Grenadier\r\n      bonnets. Close on these comes the Royal Carriage; come Royal\r\n      Carriages: for there are an Hundred National Deputies too, among\r\n      whom sits Mirabeau,—his remarks not given. Then finally,\r\n      pellmell, as rearguard, Flandre, Swiss, Hundred Swiss, other\r\n      Bodyguards, Brigands, whosoever cannot get before. Between and\r\n      among all which masses, flows without limit Saint-Antoine, and\r\n      the Menadic Cohort. Menadic especially about the Royal Carriage;\r\n      tripudiating there, covered with tricolor; singing “allusive\r\n      songs;” pointing with one hand to the Royal Carriage, which the\r\n      illusions hit, and pointing to the Provision-wagons, with the\r\n      other hand, and these words: ‘Courage, Friends! We shall not want\r\n      bread now; we are bringing you the Baker, the Bakeress, and\r\n      Baker’s Boy (_le Boulanger, la Boulangère, et le petit\r\n      Mitron_).’[259]\r\n\r\n      The wet day draggles the tricolor, but the joy is\r\n      unextinguishable. Is not all well now? ‘_Ah, Madame, notre bonne\r\n      Reine_,’ said some of these Strong-women some days hence, ‘Ah\r\n      Madame, our good Queen, don’t be a traitor any more (_ne soyez\r\n      plus traître_), and we will all love you!’ Poor Weber went\r\n      splashing along, close by the Royal carriage, with the tear in\r\n      his eye: “their Majesties did me the honour,” or I thought they\r\n      did it, “to testify, from time to time, by shrugging of the\r\n      shoulders, by looks directed to Heaven, the emotions they felt.”\r\n      Thus, like frail cockle, floats the Royal Life-boat, helmless, on\r\n      black deluges of Rascality.\r\n\r\n      Mercier, in his loose way, estimates the Procession and\r\n      assistants at two hundred thousand. He says it was one boundless\r\n      inarticulate Haha;—_transcendent_ World-Laughter; comparable to\r\n      the Saturnalia of the Ancients. Why not? Here too, as we said, is\r\n      Human Nature once more human; shudder at it whoso is of\r\n      shuddering humour: yet behold it is human. It has “swallowed all\r\n      formulas;” it tripudiates even so. For which reason they that\r\n      collect Vases and Antiques, with figures of Dancing Bacchantes\r\n      “in wild and all but impossible positions,” may look with some\r\n      interest on it.\r\n\r\n      Thus, however, has the slow-moving Chaos or modern Saturnalia of\r\n      the Ancients, reached the Barrier; and must halt, to be harangued\r\n      by Mayor Bailly. Thereafter it has to lumber along, between the\r\n      double row of faces, in the transcendent heaven-lashing Haha; two\r\n      hours longer, towards the Hôtel-de-Ville. Then again to be\r\n      harangued there, by several persons; by Moreau de Saint-Méry,\r\n      among others; Moreau of the Three-thousand orders, now National\r\n      Deputy for St. Domingo. To all which poor Louis, who seemed to\r\n      “experience a slight emotion” on entering this Townhall, can\r\n      answer only that he ‘comes with pleasure, with confidence among\r\n      his people.’ Mayor Bailly, in reporting it, forgets “confidence;”\r\n      and the poor Queen says eagerly: ‘Add, with\r\n      confidence.’—‘Messieurs,’ rejoins Bailly, ‘You are happier than\r\n      if I had not forgot.’\r\n\r\n      Finally, the King is shewn on an upper balcony, by torchlight,\r\n      with a huge tricolor in his hat: “And all the ‘people,’ says\r\n      Weber, grasped one another’s hands;—thinking _now_ surely the New\r\n      Era was born.” Hardly till eleven at night can Royalty get to its\r\n      vacant, long-deserted Palace of the Tuileries: to lodge there,\r\n      somewhat in strolling-player fashion. It is Tuesday, the sixth of\r\n      October, 1789.\r\n\r\n      Poor Louis has Two other Paris Processions to make: one\r\n      ludicrous-ignominious like this; the other not ludicrous nor\r\n      ignominious, but serious, nay sublime.\r\n\r\n END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n      VOLUME II.\r\n      THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nMauern seh ich’ gestürzt, und Mauern seh’ ich errichtet\r\n    Hier Gefangene, dort auch der Gefangenen viel.\r\nIst vielleicht nur die Welt ein grosser Kerker? Und frei ist\r\n    Wohl der Tolle, der sich Ketten zu Kränzen erkiest?\r\n\r\n GOETHE.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 2.I.\r\n      THE FEAST OF PIKES\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.I.\r\n      In the Tuileries.\r\n\r\n      The victim having once got his stroke-of-grace, the catastrophe\r\n      can be considered as almost come. There is small interest now in\r\n      watching his long low moans: notable only are his sharper\r\n      agonies, what convulsive struggles he may take to cast the\r\n      torture off from him; and then finally the last departure of life\r\n      itself, and how he lies extinct and ended, either wrapt like\r\n      Cæsar in decorous mantle-folds, or unseemly sunk together, like\r\n      one that had not the force even to die.\r\n\r\n      Was French Royalty, when wrenched forth from its tapestries in\r\n      that fashion, on that Sixth of October 1789, such a victim?\r\n      Universal France, and Royal Proclamation to all the Provinces,\r\n      answers anxiously, _No._ Nevertheless one may fear the worst.\r\n      Royalty was beforehand so decrepit, moribund, there is little\r\n      life in it to heal an injury. How much of its strength, which was\r\n      of the imagination merely, has fled; Rascality having looked\r\n      plainly in the King’s face, and not died! When the assembled\r\n      crows can pluck up their scarecrow, and say to it, Here shalt\r\n      thou stand and not there; and can treat with it, and make it,\r\n      from an infinite, a quite finite Constitutional scarecrow,—what\r\n      is to be looked for? Not in the finite Constitutional scarecrow,\r\n      but in what still unmeasured, infinite-seeming force may rally\r\n      round it, is there thenceforth any hope. For it is most true that\r\n      all available Authority is _mystic_ in its conditions, and comes\r\n      “by the grace of God.”\r\n\r\n      Cheerfuller than watching the death-struggles of Royalism will it\r\n      be to watch the growth and gambollings of Sansculottism; for, in\r\n      human things, especially in human society, all death is but a\r\n      death-birth: thus if the sceptre is departing from Louis, it is\r\n      only that, in other forms, other sceptres, were it even\r\n      pike-sceptres, may bear sway. In a prurient element, rich with\r\n      nutritive influences, we shall find that Sansculottism grows\r\n      lustily, and even frisks in not ungraceful sport: as indeed most\r\n      young creatures are sportful; nay, may it not be noted further,\r\n      that as the grown cat, and cat-species generally, is the\r\n      cruellest thing known, so the merriest is precisely the kitten,\r\n      or growing cat?\r\n\r\n      But fancy the Royal Family risen from its truckle-beds on the\r\n      morrow of that mad day: fancy the Municipal inquiry, ‘How would\r\n      your Majesty please to lodge?’—and then that the King’s rough\r\n      answer, ‘Each may lodge as he can, I am well enough,’ is congeed\r\n      and bowed away, in expressive grins, by the Townhall\r\n      Functionaries, with obsequious upholsterers at their back; and\r\n      how the Château of the Tuileries is repainted, regarnished into a\r\n      golden Royal Residence; and Lafayette with his blue National\r\n      Guards lies encompassing it, as blue Neptune (in the language of\r\n      poets) does an island, wooingly. Thither may the wrecks of\r\n      rehabilitated Loyalty gather; if it will become Constitutional;\r\n      for Constitutionalism thinks no evil; Sansculottism itself\r\n      rejoices in the King’s countenance. The rubbish of a Menadic\r\n      Insurrection, as in this ever-kindly world all rubbish can and\r\n      must be, is swept aside; and so again, on clear arena, under new\r\n      conditions, with something even of a new stateliness, we begin a\r\n      new course of action.\r\n\r\n      Arthur Young has witnessed the strangest scene: Majesty walking\r\n      unattended in the Tuileries Gardens; and miscellaneous tricolor\r\n      crowds, who cheer it, and reverently make way for it: the very\r\n      Queen commands at lowest respectful silence, regretful\r\n      avoidance.[260] Simple ducks, in those royal waters, quackle for\r\n      crumbs from young royal fingers: the little Dauphin has a little\r\n      railed garden, where he is seen delving, with ruddy cheeks and\r\n      flaxen curled hair; also a little hutch to put his tools in, and\r\n      screen himself against showers. What peaceable simplicity! Is it\r\n      peace of a Father restored to his children? Or of a Taskmaster\r\n      who has lost his whip? Lafayette and the Municipality and\r\n      universal Constitutionalism assert the former, and do what is in\r\n      them to realise it. Such Patriotism as snarls dangerously, and\r\n      shows teeth, Patrollotism shall suppress; or far better, Royalty\r\n      shall soothe down the angry hair of it, by gentle pattings; and,\r\n      most effectual of all, by fuller diet. Yes, not only shall Paris\r\n      be fed, but the King’s hand be seen in that work. The household\r\n      goods of the Poor shall, up to a certain amount, by royal bounty,\r\n      be disengaged from pawn, and that insatiable _Mont de Piété_\r\n      disgorge: rides in the city with their _Vive-le-Roi_ need not\r\n      fail; and so by substance and show, shall Royalty, if man’s art\r\n      can popularise it, be popularised.[261]\r\n\r\n      Or, alas, is it neither restored Father nor diswhipped Taskmaster\r\n      that walks there; but an anomalous complex of both these, and of\r\n      innumerable other heterogeneities; reducible to no rubric, if not\r\n      to this newly devised one: _King Louis Restorer of French\r\n      Liberty?_ Man indeed, and King Louis like other men, lives in\r\n      this world to make rule out of the ruleless; by his living\r\n      energy, he shall force the absurd itself to become less absurd.\r\n      But then if there _be_ no living energy; living passivity only?\r\n      King Serpent, hurled into his unexpected watery dominion, did at\r\n      least bite, and assert credibly that he was there: but as for the\r\n      poor King Log, tumbled hither and thither as thousandfold chance\r\n      and other will than his might direct, how happy for him that he\r\n      was indeed wooden; and, doing nothing, could also see and suffer\r\n      nothing! It is a distracted business.\r\n\r\n      For his French Majesty, meanwhile, one of the worst things is\r\n      that he can get no hunting. Alas, no hunting henceforth; only a\r\n      fatal being-hunted! Scarcely, in the next June weeks, shall he\r\n      taste again the joys of the game-destroyer; in next June, and\r\n      never more. He sends for his smith-tools; gives, in the course of\r\n      the day, official or ceremonial business being ended, “a few\r\n      strokes of the file, _quelques coups de lime._[262] Innocent\r\n      brother mortal, why wert thou not an obscure substantial maker of\r\n      locks; but doomed in that other far-seen craft, to be a maker\r\n      only of world-follies, unrealities; things self destructive,\r\n      which no mortal hammering could rivet into coherence!\r\n\r\n      Poor Louis is not without insight, nor even without the elements\r\n      of will; some sharpness of temper, spurting at times from a\r\n      stagnating character. If harmless inertness could save him, it\r\n      were well; but he will slumber and painfully dream, and to _do_\r\n      aught is not given him. Royalist Antiquarians still shew the\r\n      rooms where Majesty and suite, in these extraordinary\r\n      circumstances, had their lodging. Here sat the Queen;\r\n      reading,—for she had her library brought hither, though the King\r\n      refused his; taking vehement counsel of the vehement\r\n      uncounselled; sorrowing over altered times; yet with sure hope of\r\n      better: in her young rosy Boy, has she not the living emblem of\r\n      hope! It is a murky, working sky; yet with golden gleams—of dawn,\r\n      or of deeper meteoric night? Here again this chamber, on the\r\n      other side of the main entrance, was the King’s: here his Majesty\r\n      breakfasted, and did official work; here daily after breakfast he\r\n      received the Queen; sometimes in pathetic friendliness; sometimes\r\n      in human sulkiness, for flesh is weak; and, when questioned about\r\n      business would answer: ‘Madame, your business is with the\r\n      children.’ Nay, Sire, were it not better you, your Majesty’s\r\n      self, took the children? So asks impartial History; scornful that\r\n      the _thicker_ vessel was not also the stronger; pity-struck for\r\n      the porcelain-clay of humanity rather than for the\r\n      tile-clay,—though indeed _both_ were broken!\r\n\r\n      So, however, in this Medicean Tuileries, shall the French King\r\n      and Queen now sit, for one-and-forty months; and see a\r\n      wild-fermenting France work out its own destiny, and theirs.\r\n      Months bleak, ungenial, of rapid vicissitude; yet with a mild\r\n      pale splendour, here and there: as of an April that were leading\r\n      to leafiest Summer; as of an October that led only to everlasting\r\n      Frost. Medicean Tuileries, how changed since it was a peaceful\r\n      Tile field! Or is the ground itself fate-stricken, accursed: an\r\n      Atreus’ Palace; for that Louvre window is still nigh, out of\r\n      which a Capet, whipt of the Furies, fired his signal of the Saint\r\n      Bartholomew! Dark is the way of the Eternal as mirrored in this\r\n      world of Time: God’s way is in the sea, and His path in the great\r\n      deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.II.\r\n      In the Salle de Manége.\r\n\r\n      To believing Patriots, however, it is now clear, that the\r\n      Constitution will march, _marcher_,—had it once legs to stand on.\r\n      Quick, then, ye Patriots, bestir yourselves, and make it; shape\r\n      legs for it! In the _Archevêché_, or Archbishop’s Palace, his\r\n      Grace himself having fled; and afterwards in the Riding-hall,\r\n      named Manege, close on the Tuileries: there does a National\r\n      Assembly apply itself to the miraculous work. Successfully, had\r\n      there been any heaven-scaling Prometheus among them; not\r\n      successfully since there was none! There, in noisy debate, for\r\n      the sessions are occasionally “scandalous,” and as many as three\r\n      speakers have been seen in the Tribune at once,—let us continue\r\n      to fancy it wearing the slow months.\r\n\r\n      Tough, dogmatic, long of wind is Abbé Maury; Ciceronian pathetic\r\n      is Cazalès. Keen-trenchant, on the other side, glitters a young\r\n      Barnave; abhorrent of sophistry; sheering, like keen Damascus\r\n      sabre, all sophistry asunder,—reckless what else he sheer with\r\n      it. Simple seemest thou, O solid Dutch-built Pétion; if solid,\r\n      surely dull. Nor lifegiving in that tone of thine, livelier\r\n      polemical Rabaut. With ineffable serenity sniffs great Sieyes,\r\n      aloft, alone; his Constitution ye may babble over, ye may mar,\r\n      but can by no possibility mend: is not Polity a science he has\r\n      exhausted? Cool, slow, two military Lameths are visible, with\r\n      their quality sneer, or demi-sneer; they shall gallantly refund\r\n      their Mother’s Pension, when the Red Book is produced; gallantly\r\n      be wounded in duels. A Marquis Toulongeon, whose Pen we yet\r\n      thank, sits there; in stoical meditative humour, oftenest silent,\r\n      accepts what destiny will send. Thouret and Parlementary Duport\r\n      produce mountains of Reformed Law; liberal, Anglomaniac,\r\n      available and unavailable. Mortals rise and fall. Shall goose\r\n      Gobel, for example,—or Go(with an umlaut)bel, for he is of\r\n      Strasburg German breed, be a Constitutional Archbishop?\r\n\r\n      Alone of all men there, Mirabeau may begin to discern clearly\r\n      whither all this is tending. Patriotism, accordingly, regrets\r\n      that his zeal seems to be getting cool. In that famed\r\n      Pentecost-Night of the Fourth of August, when new Faith rose\r\n      suddenly into miraculous fire, and old Feudality was burnt up,\r\n      men remarked that Mirabeau took no hand in it; that, in fact, he\r\n      luckily happened to be absent. But did he not defend the _Veto_,\r\n      nay _Veto Absolu;_ and tell vehement Barnave that six hundred\r\n      irresponsible senators would make of all tyrannies the\r\n      insupportablest? Again, how anxious was he that the King’s\r\n      Ministers should have seat and voice in the National\r\n      Assembly;—doubtless with an eye to being Minister himself!\r\n      Whereupon the National Assembly decides, what is very momentous,\r\n      that no Deputy shall be Minister; he, in his haughty stormful\r\n      manner, advising us to make it, “no Deputy called Mirabeau.”[263]\r\n      A man of perhaps inveterate Feudalisms; of stratagems; too often\r\n      visible leanings towards the Royalist side: a man suspect; whom\r\n      Patriotism will unmask! Thus, in these June days, when the\r\n      question _Who shall have right to declare war?_ comes on, you\r\n      hear hoarse Hawkers sound dolefully through the streets, ‘Grand\r\n      Treason of Count Mirabeau, price only one sou;’—because he pleads\r\n      that it shall be not the Assembly but the King! Pleads; nay\r\n      prevails: for in spite of the hoarse Hawkers, and an endless\r\n      Populace raised by them to the pitch even of “_Lanterne_,” he\r\n      mounts the Tribune next day; grim-resolute; murmuring aside to\r\n      his friends that speak of danger: ‘I know it: I must come hence\r\n      either in triumph, or else torn in fragments;’ and it was in\r\n      triumph that he came.\r\n\r\n      A man of stout heart; whose popularity is not of the populace,\r\n      “_pas populacière;_” whom no clamour of unwashed mobs without\r\n      doors, or of washed mobs within, can scarce from his way! Dumont\r\n      remembers hearing him deliver a Report on Marseilles; “every word\r\n      was interrupted on the part of the _Côté Droit_ by abusive\r\n      epithets; calumniator, liar, assassin, scoundrel (_scélérat_):\r\n      Mirabeau pauses a moment, and, in a honeyed tone, addressing the\r\n      most furious, says: ‘I wait, Messieurs, till these amenities be\r\n      exhausted.’”[264] A man enigmatic, difficult to unmask! For\r\n      example, whence comes his money? Can the profit of a Newspaper,\r\n      sorely eaten into by Dame Le Jay; can this, and the eighteen\r\n      francs a-day your National Deputy has, be supposed equal to this\r\n      expenditure? House in the Chaussée d’Antin; Country-house at\r\n      Argenteuil; splendours, sumptuosities, orgies;—living as if he\r\n      had a mint! All saloons barred against Adventurer Mirabeau, are\r\n      flung wide open to King Mirabeau, the cynosure of Europe, whom\r\n      female France flutters to behold,—though the Man Mirabeau is one\r\n      and the same. As for money, one may conjecture that Royalism\r\n      furnishes it; which if Royalism do, will not the same be welcome,\r\n      as money always is to him?\r\n\r\n      “Sold,” whatever Patriotism thinks, he cannot readily be: the\r\n      spiritual fire which is in that man; which shining through such\r\n      confusions is nevertheless Conviction, and makes him strong, and\r\n      without which he had no strength,—is not buyable nor saleable; in\r\n      such transference of barter, it would vanish and not _be_.\r\n      Perhaps “paid and not sold, _payé pas vendu:_” as poor Rivarol,\r\n      in the unhappier converse way, calls himself “sold and not paid!”\r\n      A man travelling, comet-like, in splendour and nebulosity, his\r\n      wild way; whom telescopic Patriotism may long watch, but, without\r\n      higher mathematics, will not make out. A questionable most\r\n      blameable man; yet to us the far notablest of all. With rich\r\n      munificence, as we often say, in a most blinkard, bespectacled,\r\n      logic-chopping generation, Nature has gifted this man with an\r\n      eye. Welcome is his word, there where he speaks and works; and\r\n      growing ever welcomer; for it alone goes to the heart of the\r\n      business: logical cobwebbery shrinks itself together; and thou\r\n      seest a _thing_, how it is, how is may be worked with.\r\n\r\n      Unhappily our National Assembly has much to do: a France to\r\n      regenerate; and France is short of so many requisites; short even\r\n      of cash! These same Finances give trouble enough; no choking of\r\n      the Deficit; which gapes ever, _Give, give!_ To appease the\r\n      Deficit we venture on a hazardous step, sale of the Clergy’s\r\n      Lands and superfluous Edifices; most hazardous. Nay, given the\r\n      sale, who is to buy them, ready-money having fled? Wherefore, on\r\n      the 19th day of December, a paper-money of “_Assignats_,” of\r\n      Bonds secured, or _assigned_, on that Clerico-National Property,\r\n      and unquestionable at least in payment of that,—is decreed: the\r\n      first of a long series of like financial performances, which\r\n      shall astonish mankind. So that now, while old rags last, there\r\n      shall be no lack of circulating medium; whether of commodities to\r\n      circulate thereon is another question. But, after all, does not\r\n      this Assignat business speak volumes for modern science?\r\n      Bankruptcy, we may say, was come, as the _end_ of all Delusions\r\n      needs must come: yet how gently, in softening diffusion, in mild\r\n      succession, was it hereby made to fall;—like no all-destroying\r\n      avalanche; like gentle showers of a powdery impalpable snow,\r\n      shower after shower, till all was indeed buried, and yet little\r\n      was destroyed that could not be replaced, be dispensed with! To\r\n      such length has modern machinery reached. Bankruptcy, we said,\r\n      was great; but indeed Money itself is a standing miracle.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, it is a matter of endless difficulty, that of the\r\n      Clergy. Clerical property may be made the Nation’s, and the\r\n      Clergy hired servants of the State; but if so, is it not an\r\n      altered Church? Adjustment enough, of the most confused sort, has\r\n      become unavoidable. Old landmarks, in any sense, avail not in a\r\n      new France. Nay literally, the very Ground is new divided; your\r\n      old party-coloured _Provinces_ become new uniform _Departments_,\r\n      Eighty-three in number;—whereby, as in some sudden shifting of\r\n      the Earth’s axis, no mortal knows his new latitude at once. The\r\n      Twelve old Parlements too, what is to be done with them? The old\r\n      Parlements are declared to be all “in permanent vacation,”—till\r\n      once the new equal-justice, of Departmental Courts, National\r\n      Appeal-Court, of elective Justices, Justices of Peace, and other\r\n      Thouret-and-Duport apparatus be got ready. They have to sit\r\n      there, these old Parlements, uneasily waiting; as it were, with\r\n      the rope round their neck; crying as they can, _Is there none to\r\n      deliver us?_ But happily the answer being, _None, none_, they are\r\n      a manageable class, these Parlements. They can be bullied, even\r\n      into silence; the Paris Parliament, wiser than most, has never\r\n      whimpered. They will and must sit there; in such vacation as is\r\n      fit; their Chamber of Vacation distributes in the interim what\r\n      little justice is going. With the rope round their neck, their\r\n      destiny may be succinct! On the 13th of November 1790, Mayor\r\n      Bailly shall walk to the Palais de Justice, few even heeding him;\r\n      and with municipal seal-stamp and a little hot wax, seal up the\r\n      Parlementary Paper-rooms,—and the dread Parlement of Paris pass\r\n      away, into Chaos, gently as does a Dream! So shall the Parlements\r\n      perish, succinctly; and innumerable eyes be dry.\r\n\r\n      Not so the Clergy. For granting even that Religion were dead;\r\n      that it had died, half-centuries ago, with unutterable Dubois; or\r\n      emigrated lately, to Alsace, with Necklace-Cardinal Rohan; or\r\n      that it now walked as goblin _revenant_ with Bishop Talleyrand of\r\n      Autun; yet does not the Shadow of Religion, the Cant of Religion,\r\n      still linger? The Clergy have means and material: means, of\r\n      number, organization, social weight; a material, at lowest, of\r\n      public ignorance, known to be the mother of devotion. Nay,\r\n      withal, is it incredible that there might, in simple hearts,\r\n      latent here and there like gold grains in the mud-beach, still\r\n      dwell some real Faith in God, of so singular and tenacious a sort\r\n      that even a Maury or a Talleyrand, could still be the symbol for\r\n      it?—Enough, and Clergy has strength, the Clergy has craft and\r\n      indignation. It is a most fatal business this of the Clergy. A\r\n      weltering hydra-coil, which the National Assembly has stirred up\r\n      about its ears; hissing, stinging; which cannot be appeased,\r\n      alive; which cannot be trampled dead! Fatal, from first to last!\r\n      Scarcely after fifteen months’ debating, can a _Civil\r\n      Constitution of the Clergy_ be so much as got to paper; and then\r\n      for getting it into reality? Alas, such Civil Constitution is but\r\n      an agreement to disagree. It divides France from end to end, with\r\n      a new split, infinitely complicating all the other\r\n      splits;—Catholicism, what of it there is left, with the Cant of\r\n      Catholicism, raging on the one side, and sceptic Heathenism on\r\n      the other; both, by contradiction , waxing fanatic. What endless\r\n      jarring, of Refractory hated Priests, and Constitutional despised\r\n      ones; of tender consciences, like the King’s, and consciences\r\n      hot-seared, like certain of his People’s: the whole to end in\r\n      Feasts of Reason and a War of La Vendée! So deep-seated is\r\n      Religion in the heart of man, and holds of all infinite passions.\r\n      If the dead echo of it still did so much, what could not the\r\n      living voice of it once do?\r\n\r\n      Finance and Constitution, Law and Gospel: this surely were work\r\n      enough; yet this is not all. In fact, the Ministry, and Necker\r\n      himself whom a brass inscription “fastened by the people over his\r\n      door-lintel” testifies to be the “_Ministre adoré_,” are\r\n      dwindling into clearer and clearer nullity. Execution or\r\n      legislation, arrangement or detail, from their nerveless fingers\r\n      all drops undone; all lights at last on the toiled shoulders of\r\n      an august Representative Body. Heavy-laden National Assembly! It\r\n      has to hear of innumerable fresh revolts, Brigand expeditions; of\r\n      Châteaus in the West, especially of Charter-chests, _Chartiers_,\r\n      set on fire; for there too the overloaded Ass frightfully\r\n      recalcitrates. Of Cities in the South full of heats and\r\n      jealousies; which will end in crossed sabres, Marseilles against\r\n      Toulon, and Carpentras beleaguered by Avignon;—such Royalist\r\n      collision in a career of Freedom; nay Patriot collision, which a\r\n      mere difference of _velocity_ will bring about! Of a Jourdan\r\n      Coup-tete, who has skulked thitherward, from the claws of the\r\n      Chatelet; and will raise whole scoundrel-regiments.\r\n\r\n      Also it has to hear of Royalist _Camp of Jalès:_ Jalès\r\n      mountain-girdled Plain, amid the rocks of the Cevennes; whence\r\n      Royalism, as is feared and hoped, may dash down like a mountain\r\n      deluge, and submerge France! A singular thing this camp of Jalès;\r\n      existing mostly on paper. For the Soldiers at Jalès, being\r\n      peasants or National Guards, were in heart sworn Sansculottes;\r\n      and all that the Royalist Captains could do was, with false\r\n      words, to keep them, or rather keep the report of them, drawn up\r\n      there, visible to all imaginations, for a terror and a sign,—if\r\n      peradventure France might be reconquered by theatrical machinery,\r\n      by the _picture_ of a Royalist Army done to the life![265] Not\r\n      till the third summer was this portent, burning out by fits and\r\n      then fading, got finally extinguished; was the old Castle of\r\n      Jalès, no Camp being visible to the bodily eye, got blown asunder\r\n      by some National Guards.\r\n\r\n      Also it has to hear not only of Brissot and his _Friends of the\r\n      Blacks_, but by and by of a whole St. Domingo blazing skyward;\r\n      blazing in literal fire, and in far worse metaphorical; beaconing\r\n      the nightly main. Also of the shipping interest, and the\r\n      landed-interest, and all manner of interests, reduced to\r\n      distress. Of Industry every where manacled, bewildered; and only\r\n      Rebellion thriving. Of sub-officers, soldiers and sailors in\r\n      mutiny by land and water. Of soldiers, at Nanci, as we shall see,\r\n      needing to be cannonaded by a brave Bouillé. Of sailors, nay the\r\n      very galley-slaves, at Brest, needing also to be cannonaded; but\r\n      with no Bouillé to do it. For indeed, to say it in a word, in\r\n      those days there was _no King_ in Israel, and every man did that\r\n      which was right in his own eyes.[266]\r\n\r\n      Such things has an august National Assembly to hear of, as it\r\n      goes on regenerating France. Sad and stern: but what remedy? Get\r\n      the Constitution ready; and all men will swear to it: for do not\r\n      “Addresses of adhesion” arrive by the cartload? In this manner,\r\n      by Heaven’s blessing, and a Constitution got ready, shall the\r\n      bottomless fire-gulf be vaulted in, with rag-paper; and Order\r\n      will wed Freedom, and live with her there,—till it grow too hot\r\n      for them. _O Côté Gauche_, worthy are ye, as the adhesive\r\n      Addresses generally say, to “fix the regards of the Universe;”\r\n      the regards of this one poor Planet, at lowest!—\r\n\r\n      Nay, it must be owned, the _Côté Droit_ makes a still madder\r\n      figure. An irrational generation; irrational, imbecile, and with\r\n      the vehement obstinacy characteristic of that; a generation which\r\n      will not learn. Falling Bastilles, Insurrections of Women,\r\n      thousands of smoking Manorhouses, a country bristling with no\r\n      crop but that of Sansculottic steel: these were tolerably\r\n      didactic lessons; but them they have not taught. There are still\r\n      men, of whom it was of old written, Bray them in a mortar! Or, in\r\n      milder language, They have _wedded_ their delusions: fire nor\r\n      steel, nor any sharpness of Experience, shall sever the bond;\r\n      till death do us part! Of such may the Heavens have mercy; for\r\n      the Earth, with her rigorous Necessity, will have none.\r\n\r\n      Admit, at the same time, that it was most natural. Man lives by\r\n      Hope: Pandora when her box of gods’-gifts flew all out, and\r\n      became gods’-curses, still retained Hope. How shall an irrational\r\n      mortal, when his high-place is never so evidently pulled down,\r\n      and he, being irrational, is left resourceless,—part with the\r\n      belief that it will be rebuilt? It would make all so straight\r\n      again; it seems so unspeakably desirable; so reasonable,—would\r\n      you but look at it aright! For, must not the thing which was\r\n      continue to be; or else the solid World dissolve? Yes, persist, O\r\n      infatuated Sansculottes of France! Revolt against constituted\r\n      Authorities; hunt out your rightful Seigneurs, who at bottom so\r\n      loved you, and readily shed their blood for you,—in country’s\r\n      battles as at Rossbach and elsewhere; and, even in preserving\r\n      game, were preserving _you_, could ye but have understood it:\r\n      hunt them out, as if they were wild wolves; set fire to their\r\n      Châteaus and Chartiers as to wolf-dens; and what then? Why, then\r\n      turn every man his hand against his fellow! In confusion, famine,\r\n      desolation, regret the days that are gone; rueful recall them,\r\n      recall us with them. To repentant prayers we will not be deaf.\r\n\r\n      So, with dimmer or clearer consciousness, must the Right Side\r\n      reason and act. An inevitable position perhaps; but a most false\r\n      one for them. Evil, be thou our good: this henceforth must\r\n      virtually be their prayer. The fiercer the effervescence grows,\r\n      the sooner will it pass; for after all it is but some mad\r\n      effervescence; the World is solid, and cannot dissolve.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, if they have any positive industry, it is that of\r\n      plots, and backstairs conclaves. Plots which cannot be executed;\r\n      which are mostly theoretic on their part;—for which nevertheless\r\n      this and the other practical Sieur Augeard, Sieur Maillebois,\r\n      Sieur Bonne Savardin, gets into trouble, gets imprisoned, and\r\n      escapes with difficulty. Nay there is a poor practical Chevalier\r\n      Favras who, not without some passing reflex on Monsieur himself,\r\n      gets hanged for them, amid loud uproar of the world. Poor Favras,\r\n      he keeps dictating his last will at the “Hôtel-de-Ville, through\r\n      the whole remainder of the day,” a weary February day; offers to\r\n      reveal secrets, if they will save him; handsomely declines since\r\n      they will not; then dies, in the flare of torchlight, with\r\n      politest composure; remarking, rather than exclaiming, with\r\n      outspread hands: ‘People, I die innocent; pray for me.’[267] Poor\r\n      Favras;—type of so much that has prowled indefatigable over\r\n      France, in days now ending; and, in freer field, might have\r\n      _earned_ instead of prowling,—to thee it is no theory!\r\n\r\n      In the Senate-house again, the attitude of the Right Side is that\r\n      of calm unbelief. Let an august National Assembly make a\r\n      Fourth-of-August Abolition of Feudality; declare the Clergy\r\n      State-servants who shall have wages; vote Suspensive Vetos, new\r\n      Law-Courts; vote or decree what contested thing it will; have it\r\n      responded to from the four corners of France, nay get King’s\r\n      Sanction, and what other Acceptance were conceivable,—the Right\r\n      Side, as we find, persists, with imperturbablest tenacity, in\r\n      considering, and ever and anon shews that it still considers, all\r\n      these so-called Decrees as mere temporary whims, which indeed\r\n      stand on paper, but in practice and fact are not, and cannot be.\r\n      Figure the brass head of an Abbé Maury flooding forth Jesuitic\r\n      eloquence in this strain; dusky d’Espréménil, Barrel Mirabeau\r\n      (probably in liquor), and enough of others, cheering him from the\r\n      Right; and, for example, with what visage a seagreen Robespierre\r\n      eyes him from the Left. And how Sieyes ineffably sniffs on him,\r\n      or does not deign to sniff; and how the Galleries groan in\r\n      spirit, or bark rabid on him: so that to escape the Lanterne, on\r\n      stepping forth, he needs presence of mind, and a pair of pistols\r\n      in his girdle! For he is one of the toughest of men.\r\n\r\n      Here indeed becomes notable one great difference between our two\r\n      kinds of civil war; between the modern _lingual_ or\r\n      Parliamentary-logical kind, and the ancient, or _manual_ kind, in\r\n      the steel battle-field;—much to the disadvantage of the former.\r\n      In the manual kind, where you front your foe with drawn weapon,\r\n      one right stroke is final; for, physically speaking, when the\r\n      brains are out the man does honestly die, and trouble you no\r\n      more. But how different when it is with arguments you fight! Here\r\n      no victory yet definable can be considered as final. Beat him\r\n      down, with Parliamentary invective, till sense be fled; cut him\r\n      in two, hanging one half in this dilemma-horn, the other on that;\r\n      blow the brains or thinking-faculty quite out of him for the\r\n      time: it skills not; he rallies and revives on the morrow;\r\n      tomorrow he repairs his golden fires! The think that _will_\r\n      logically extinguish him is perhaps still a desideratum in\r\n      Constitutional civilisation. For how, till a man know, in some\r\n      measure, at what point he becomes logically defunct, can\r\n      Parliamentary Business be carried on, and Talk cease or slake?\r\n\r\n      Doubtless it was some feeling of this difficulty; and the clear\r\n      insight how little such knowledge yet existed in the French\r\n      Nation, new in the Constitutional career, and how defunct\r\n      Aristocrats would continue to walk for unlimited periods, as\r\n      Partridge the Alamanack-maker did,—that had sunk into the deep\r\n      mind of People’s-friend Marat, an eminently practical mind; and\r\n      had grown there, in that richest putrescent soil, into the most\r\n      original plan of action ever submitted to a People. Not yet has\r\n      it grown; but it has germinated, it is growing; rooting itself\r\n      into Tartarus, branching towards Heaven: the second season hence,\r\n      we shall see it risen out of the bottomless Darkness, full-grown,\r\n      into disastrous Twilight,—a Hemlock-tree, great as the world; on\r\n      or under whose boughs all the People’s-friends of the world may\r\n      lodge. “Two hundred and sixty thousand Aristocrat heads:” that is\r\n      the precisest calculation, though one would not stand on a few\r\n      hundreds; yet we never rise as high as the round three hundred\r\n      thousand. Shudder at it, O People; but it is as true as that ye\r\n      yourselves, and your People’s-friend, are alive. These prating\r\n      Senators of yours hover ineffectual on the barren letter, and\r\n      will never save the Revolution. A Cassandra-Marat cannot do it,\r\n      with his single shrunk arm; but with a few determined men it were\r\n      possible. ‘Give me,’ said the People’s-friend, in his cold way,\r\n      when young Barbaroux, once his pupil in a course of what was\r\n      called Optics, went to see him, ‘Give me two hundred Naples\r\n      Bravoes, armed each with a good dirk, and a muff on his left arm\r\n      by way of shield: with them I will traverse France, and\r\n      accomplish the Revolution.’[268] Nay, be brave, young Barbaroux;\r\n      for thou seest, there is no jesting in those rheumy eyes; in that\r\n      soot-bleared figure, most earnest of created things; neither\r\n      indeed is there madness, of the strait-waistcoat sort.\r\n\r\n      Such produce shall the Time ripen in cavernous Marat, the man\r\n      forbid; living in Paris cellars, lone as fanatic Anchorite in his\r\n      Thebaid; say, as far-seen Simon on his Pillar,—taking peculiar\r\n      views therefrom. Patriots may smile; and, using him as bandog now\r\n      to be muzzled, now to be let bark, name him, as Desmoulins does,\r\n      “Maximum of Patriotism” and “Cassandra-Marat:” but were it not\r\n      singular if this dirk-and-muff plan of his (with superficial\r\n      modifications) proved to be precisely the plan adopted?\r\n\r\n      After this manner, in these circumstances, do august Senators\r\n      regenerate France. Nay, they are, in very deed, _believed_ to be\r\n      regenerating it; on account of which great fact, main fact of\r\n      their history, the wearied eye can never be permitted wholly to\r\n      ignore them.\r\n\r\n      But, looking away now from these precincts of the Tuileries,\r\n      where Constitutional Royalty, let Lafayette water it as he will,\r\n      languishes too like a cut branch; and august Senators are perhaps\r\n      at bottom only perfecting their “theory of defective verbs,”—how\r\n      does the young Reality, young Sansculottism thrive? The attentive\r\n      observer can answer: It thrives bravely; putting forth new buds;\r\n      expanding the old buds into leaves, into boughs. Is not French\r\n      Existence, as before, most prurient, all _loosened_, most\r\n      nutrient for it? Sansculottism has the property of growing by\r\n      what other things die of: by agitation, contention,\r\n      disarrangement; nay in a word, by what is the symbol and fruit of\r\n      all these: Hunger.\r\n\r\n      In such a France as this, Hunger, as we have remarked, can hardly\r\n      fail. The Provinces, the Southern Cities feel it in their turn;\r\n      and what it brings: Exasperation, preternatural Suspicion. In\r\n      Paris some halcyon days of abundance followed the Menadic\r\n      Insurrection, with its Versailles grain-carts, and recovered\r\n      Restorer of Liberty; but they could not continue. The month is\r\n      still October when famishing Saint-Antoine, in a moment of\r\n      passion, seizes a poor Baker, innocent “François the Baker;”[269]\r\n      and hangs him, in Constantinople wise;—but even this, singular as\r\n      it my seem, does not cheapen bread! Too clear it is, no Royal\r\n      bounty, no Municipal dexterity can adequately feed a\r\n      Bastille-destroying Paris. Wherefore, on view of the hanged\r\n      Baker, Constitutionalism in sorrow and anger demands “_Loi\r\n      Martiale_,” a kind of Riot Act;—and indeed gets it, most readily,\r\n      almost before the sun goes down.\r\n\r\n      This is that famed _Martial law_, with its Red Flag, its\r\n      “_Drapeau Rouge:_” in virtue of which Mayor Bailly, or any Mayor,\r\n      has but henceforth to hang out that new _Oriflamme_ of his; then\r\n      to read or mumble something about the King’s peace; and, after\r\n      certain pauses, serve any undispersing Assemblage with\r\n      musket-shot, or whatever shot will disperse it. A decisive Law;\r\n      and most just on one proviso: that all Patrollotism be of God,\r\n      and all mob-assembling be of the Devil;—otherwise not so just.\r\n      Mayor Bailly be unwilling to use it! Hang not out that new\r\n      Oriflamme, _flame_ not _of gold_ but of the want of gold! The\r\n      thrice-blessed Revolution is _done_, thou thinkest? If so it will\r\n      be well with thee.\r\n\r\n      But now let no mortal say henceforth that an august National\r\n      Assembly wants riot: all it ever wanted was riot enough to\r\n      balance Court-plotting; all it now wants, of Heaven or of Earth,\r\n      is to get its theory of defective verbs perfected.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.III.\r\n      The Muster.\r\n\r\n      With famine and a Constitutional theory of defective verbs going\r\n      on, all other excitement is conceivable. A universal shaking and\r\n      sifting of French Existence this is: in the course of which, for\r\n      one thing, what a multitude of low-lying figures are sifted to\r\n      the top, and set busily to work there!\r\n\r\n      Dogleech Marat, now for-seen as Simon Stylites, we already know;\r\n      him and others, raised aloft. The mere sample, these, of what is\r\n      coming, of what continues coming, upwards from the realm of\r\n      Night!—Chaumette, by and by Anaxagoras Chaumette, one already\r\n      descries: mellifluous in street-groups; not now a sea-boy on the\r\n      high and giddy mast: a mellifluous tribune of the common people,\r\n      with long curling locks, on _bourne_stone of the thoroughfares;\r\n      able sub-editor too; who shall rise—to the very gallows. Clerk\r\n      Tallien, he also is become sub-editor; shall become able editor;\r\n      and more. Bibliopolic Momoro, Typographic Pruhomme see new trades\r\n      opening. Collot d’Herbois, tearing a passion to rags, pauses on\r\n      the Thespian boards; listens, with that black bushy head, to the\r\n      sound of the world’s drama: shall the Mimetic become Real? Did ye\r\n      hiss him, O men of Lyons?[270] Better had ye clapped!\r\n\r\n      Happy now, indeed, for all manner of _mimetic_, half-original\r\n      men! Tumid blustering, with more or less of sincerity, which need\r\n      not be entirely sincere, yet the sincerer the better, is like to\r\n      go far. Shall we say, the Revolution-element works itself rarer\r\n      and rarer; so that only lighter and lighter bodies will float in\r\n      it; till at last the mere blown-bladder is your only swimmer?\r\n      Limitation of mind, then vehemence, promptitude, audacity, shall\r\n      all be available; to which add only these two: cunning and good\r\n      lungs. Good fortune must be presupposed. Accordingly, of all\r\n      classes the rising one, we observe, is now the Attorney class:\r\n      witness Bazires, Carriers, Fouquier-Tinvilles, Bazoche-Captain\r\n      Bourdons: more than enough. Such figures shall Night, from her\r\n      wonder-bearing bosom, emit; swarm after swarm. Of another deeper\r\n      and deepest swarm, not yet dawned on the astonished eye; of\r\n      pilfering Candle-snuffers, Thief-valets, disfrocked Capuchins,\r\n      and so many Héberts, Henriots, Ronsins, Rossignols, let us, as\r\n      long as possible, forbear speaking.\r\n\r\n      Thus, over France, all stirs that has what the Physiologists call\r\n      _irritability_ in it: how much more all wherein irritability has\r\n      perfected itself into vitality; into actual vision, and force\r\n      that can will! All stirs; and if not in Paris, flocks thither.\r\n      Great and greater waxes President Danton in his Cordeliers\r\n      Section; his rhetorical tropes are all “gigantic:” energy flashes\r\n      from his black brows, menaces in his athletic figure, rolls in\r\n      the sound of his voice “reverberating from the domes;” this man\r\n      also, like Mirabeau, has a natural _eye_, and begins to see\r\n      whither Constitutionalism is tending, though with a wish in it\r\n      different from Mirabeau’s.\r\n\r\n      Remark, on the other hand, how General Dumouriez has quitted\r\n      Normandy and the Cherbourg Breakwater, to come—whither we may\r\n      guess. It is his second or even third trial at Paris, since this\r\n      New Era began; but now it is in right earnest, for he has quitted\r\n      all else. Wiry, elastic unwearied man; whose life was but a\r\n      battle and a march! No, _not_ a creature of Choiseul’s; ‘the\r\n      creature of God and of my sword,’—he fiercely answered in old\r\n      days. Overfalling Corsican batteries, in the deadly fire-hail;\r\n      wriggling invincible from under his horse, at Closterkamp of the\r\n      Netherlands, though tethered with “crushed stirrup-iron and\r\n      nineteen wounds;” tough, minatory, standing at bay, as forlorn\r\n      hope, on the skirts of Poland; intriguing, battling in cabinet\r\n      and field; roaming far out, obscure, as King’s spial, or sitting\r\n      sealed up, enchanted in Bastille; fencing, pamphleteering,\r\n      scheming and struggling from the very birth of him,[271]—the man\r\n      has come thus far. How repressed, how irrepressible! Like some\r\n      incarnate spirit in prison, which indeed he _was;_ hewing on\r\n      granite walls for deliverance; striking fire flashes from them.\r\n      And now has the general earthquake rent his cavern too? Twenty\r\n      years younger, what might he not have done! But his hair has a\r\n      shade of gray: his way of thought is all fixed, military. He can\r\n      _grow_ no further, and the new world is in such growth. We will\r\n      name him, on the whole, one of Heaven’s Swiss; without faith;\r\n      wanting above all things work, work on _any_ side. Work also is\r\n      appointed him; and he will do it.\r\n\r\n      Not from over France only are the unrestful flocking towards\r\n      Paris; but from all sides of Europe. Where the carcase is,\r\n      thither will the eagles gather. Think how many a Spanish Guzman,\r\n      Martinico Fournier named “Fournier _l’Américain_,” Engineer\r\n      Miranda from the very Andes, were flocking or had flocked!\r\n      Walloon Pereyra might boast of the strangest parentage: him, they\r\n      say, Prince Kaunitz the Diplomatist heedlessly dropped;” like\r\n      ostrich-egg, to be hatched of Chance—into an ostrich-_eater!_\r\n      Jewish or German Freys do business in the great Cesspool of\r\n      _Agio;_ which Cesspool this _Assignat_-fiat has quickened, into a\r\n      Mother of dead dogs. Swiss Clavière could found no Socinian\r\n      Genevese Colony in Ireland; but he paused, years ago, prophetic\r\n      before the Minister’s Hôtel at Paris; and said, it was borne on\r\n      his mind that _he_ one day was to be Minister, and laughed.[272]\r\n      Swiss Pachc, on the other hand, sits sleekheaded, frugal; the\r\n      wonder of his own alley, and even of neighbouring ones, for\r\n      humility of mind, and a thought deeper than most men’s: sit\r\n      there, Tartuffe, till wanted! Ye Italian Dufournys, Flemish\r\n      Prolys, flit hither all ye bipeds of prey! Come whosesoever head\r\n      is hot; thou of mind _ungoverned_, be it chaos as of\r\n      undevelopment or chaos as of ruin; the man who cannot get known,\r\n      the man who is too well known; if thou have any vendible faculty,\r\n      nay if thou have but edacity and loquacity, come! They come; with\r\n      hot unutterabilities in their heart; as Pilgrims towards a\r\n      miraculous shrine. Nay how many come as vacant Strollers,\r\n      aimless, of whom Europe is full merely towards _something!_ For\r\n      benighted fowls, when you beat their bushes, rush towards any\r\n      light. Thus Frederick Baron Trenck too is here; mazed, purblind,\r\n      from the cells of Magdeburg; Minotauric cells, and his Ariadne\r\n      lost! Singular to say, Trenck, in these years, sells wine; not\r\n      indeed in bottle, but in wood.\r\n\r\n      Nor is our England without her missionaries. She has her\r\n      live-saving Needham;[273] to whom was solemnly presented a “civic\r\n      sword,”—long since rusted into nothingness. Her Paine: rebellious\r\n      Staymaker; unkempt; who feels that he, a single Needleman, did by\r\n      his “_Common-Sense_” Pamphlet, free America;—that he can and will\r\n      free all this World; perhaps even the other. Price-Stanhope\r\n      Constitutional Association sends over to congratulate;[274]\r\n      welcomed by National Assembly, though they are but a London Club;\r\n      whom Burke and Toryism eye askance.\r\n\r\n      On thee too, for country’s sake, O Chevalier John Paul, be a word\r\n      spent, or misspent! In faded naval uniform, Paul Jones lingers\r\n      visible here; like a wine-skin from which the wine is all drawn.\r\n      Like the ghost of himself! Low is his once loud bruit; scarcely\r\n      audible, save, with extreme tedium in ministerial ante-chambers;\r\n      in this or the other charitable dining-room, mindful of the past.\r\n      What changes; culminatings and declinings! Not now, poor Paul,\r\n      thou lookest wistful over the Solway brine, by the foot of native\r\n      Criffel, into blue mountainous Cumberland, into blue Infinitude;\r\n      environed with thrift, with humble friendliness; thyself, young\r\n      fool, longing to be aloft from it, or even to be away from it.\r\n      Yes, beyond that sapphire Promontory, which men name St. Bees,\r\n      which is not sapphire either, but dull sandstone, when one gets\r\n      _close_ to it, there is a world. Which world thou too shalt taste\r\n      of!—From yonder White Haven rise his smoke-clouds; ominous though\r\n      ineffectual. Proud Forth quakes at his bellying sails; had not\r\n      the wind suddenly shifted. Flamborough reapers, homegoing, pause\r\n      on the hill-side: for what sulphur-cloud is that that defaces the\r\n      sleek sea; sulphur-cloud spitting streaks of fire? A sea\r\n      cockfight it is, and of the hottest; where British _Serapis_ and\r\n      French-American _Bon Homme Richard_ do lash and throttle each\r\n      other, in their fashion; and lo the desperate valour has\r\n      suffocated the deliberate, and Paul Jones too is of the Kings of\r\n      the Sea!\r\n\r\n      The Euxine, the Méotian waters felt thee next, and long-skirted\r\n      Turks, O Paul; and thy fiery soul has wasted itself in thousand\r\n      contradictions;—to no purpose. For, in far lands, with scarlet\r\n      Nassau-Siegens, with sinful Imperial Catherines, is not the\r\n      heart-broken, even as at home with the mean? Poor Paul! hunger\r\n      and dispiritment track thy sinking footsteps: once or at most\r\n      twice, in this Revolution-tumult the figure of thee emerges;\r\n      mute, ghost-like, as “with stars dim-twinkling through.” And\r\n      then, when the light is gone quite out, a National Legislature\r\n      grants “ceremonial funeral!” As good had been the natural\r\n      Presbyterian Kirk-bell, and six feet of Scottish earth, among the\r\n      dust of thy loved ones.—_Such_ world lay beyond the Promontory of\r\n      St. Bees. Such is the life of sinful mankind here below.\r\n\r\n      But of all strangers, far the notablest for us is Baron Jean\r\n      Baptiste de Clootz;—or, dropping baptisms and feudalisms,\r\n      World-Citizen Anacharsis Clootz, from Cleves. Him mark, judicious\r\n      Reader. Thou hast known his Uncle, sharp-sighted thorough-going\r\n      Cornelius de Pauw, who mercilessly cuts down cherished illusions;\r\n      and of the finest antique Spartans, will make mere modern\r\n      cutthroat Mainots.[275] The like stuff is in Anacharsis: hot\r\n      metal; full of scoriae, which should and could have been smelted\r\n      out, but which will not. He has wandered over this terraqueous\r\n      Planet; seeking, one may say, the Paradise we lost long ago. He\r\n      has seen English Burke; has been seen of the Portugal\r\n      Inquisition; has roamed, and fought, and written; is writing,\r\n      among other things, “Evidences of the _Mahometan_ Religion.” But\r\n      now, like his Scythian adoptive godfather, he finds himself in\r\n      the Paris Athens; surely, at last, the haven of his soul. A\r\n      dashing man, beloved at Patriotic dinner-tables; with gaiety, nay\r\n      with humour; headlong, trenchant, of free purse; in suitable\r\n      costume; though what mortal ever more despised costumes? Under\r\n      all costumes Anacharsis seeks the man; not Stylites Marat will\r\n      more freely trample costumes, if they hold no man. This is the\r\n      faith of Anacharsis: That there is a Paradise discoverable; that\r\n      all costumes ought to hold men. O Anacharsis, it is a headlong,\r\n      swift-going faith. Mounted thereon, meseems, thou art bound\r\n      hastily for the City of _Nowhere;_ and wilt _arrive!_ At best, we\r\n      may say, arrive _in good riding attitude;_ which indeed is\r\n      something.\r\n\r\n      So many new persons, and new things, have come to occupy this\r\n      France. Her old Speech and Thought, and Activity which springs\r\n      from those, are all changing; fermenting towards unknown issues.\r\n      To the dullest peasant, as he sits sluggish, overtoiled, by his\r\n      evening hearth, one idea has come: that of Châteaus burnt; of\r\n      Châteaus combustible. How altered all Coffeehouses, in Province\r\n      or Capital! The _Antre de Procope_ has now other questions than\r\n      the Three Stagyrite Unities to settle; not theatre-controversies,\r\n      but a world-controversy: there, in the ancient pigtail mode, or\r\n      with modern Brutus’ heads, do well-frizzed logicians hold hubbub,\r\n      and Chaos umpire sits. The ever-enduring Melody of Paris Saloons\r\n      has got a new ground-tone: ever-enduring; which has been heard,\r\n      and by the listening Heaven too, since Julian the Apostate’s time\r\n      and earlier; mad now as formerly.\r\n\r\n      Ex-Censor Suard, _Ex_-Censor, for we have freedom of the Press;\r\n      he may be seen there; impartial, even neutral. Tyrant Grimm rolls\r\n      large eyes, over a questionable coming Time. Atheist Naigeon,\r\n      beloved disciple of Diderot, crows, in his small difficult way,\r\n      heralding glad dawn.[276] But, on the other hand, how many\r\n      Morellets, Marmontels, who had sat all their life hatching\r\n      Philosophe eggs, cackle now, in a state bordering on distraction,\r\n      at the brood they have brought out![277] It was so delightful to\r\n      have one’s Philosophe Theorem demonstrated, crowned in the\r\n      saloons: and now an infatuated people will not continue\r\n      speculative, but have Practice?\r\n\r\n      There also observe Preceptress Genlis, or Sillery, or\r\n      Sillery-Genlis,—for our husband is both Count and Marquis, and we\r\n      have more than one title. Pretentious, frothy; a puritan yet\r\n      creedless; darkening counsel by words without wisdom! For, it is\r\n      in that thin element of the Sentimentalist and\r\n      Distinguished-Female that Sillery-Genlis works; she would gladly\r\n      be sincere, yet can grow no sincerer than sincere-cant:\r\n      sincere-cant of many forms, ending in the devotional form. For\r\n      the present, on a neck still of moderate whiteness, she wears as\r\n      jewel a miniature Bastille, cut on mere sandstone, but then\r\n      actual Bastille sandstone. M. le Marquis is one of d’Orléans’s\r\n      errandmen; in National Assembly, and elsewhere. Madame, for her\r\n      part, trains up a youthful d’Orléans generation in what\r\n      superfinest morality one can; gives meanwhile rather enigmatic\r\n      account of fair Mademoiselle Pamela, the Daughter whom she has\r\n      _adopted_. Thus she, in Palais Royal saloon;—whither, we remark,\r\n      d’Orléans himself, spite of Lafayette, has returned from that\r\n      English “mission” of his: surely no pleasant mission: for the\r\n      English would not speak to him; and Saint Hannah More of England,\r\n      so unlike Saint Sillery-Genlis of France, saw him shunned, in\r\n      Vauxhall Gardens, like one pest-struck,[278] and his red-blue\r\n      impassive visage waxing hardly a shade bluer.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.IV.\r\n      Journalism.\r\n\r\n      As for Constitutionalism, with its National Guards, it is doing\r\n      what it can; and has enough to do: it must, as ever, with one\r\n      hand wave persuasively, repressing Patriotism; and keep the other\r\n      clenched to menace Royalty plotters. A most delicate task;\r\n      requiring tact.\r\n\r\n      Thus, if People’s-friend Marat has today his writ of “_prise de\r\n      corps_, or seizure of body,” served on him, and dives out of\r\n      sight, tomorrow he is left at large; or is even encouraged, as a\r\n      sort of bandog whose baying may be useful. President Danton, in\r\n      open Hall, with reverberating voice, declares that, in a case\r\n      like Marat’s, ‘force may be resisted by force.’ Whereupon the\r\n      Chatelet serves Danton also with a writ;—which, however, as the\r\n      whole Cordeliers District responds to it, what Constable will be\r\n      prompt to execute? Twice more, on new occasions, does the\r\n      Chatelet launch its writ; and twice more in vain: the body of\r\n      Danton cannot be seized by Châtelet; he unseized, should he even\r\n      fly for a season, shall behold the Châtelet itself flung into\r\n      limbo.\r\n\r\n      Municipality and Brissot, meanwhile, are far on with their\r\n      Municipal Constitution. The Sixty _Districts_ shall become\r\n      Forty-eight _Sections;_ much shall be adjusted, and Paris have\r\n      its Constitution. A Constitution wholly Elective; as indeed all\r\n      French Government shall and must be. And yet, one fatal element\r\n      has been introduced: that of _citoyen actif_. No man who does not\r\n      pay the _marc d’argent_, or yearly tax equal to three days’\r\n      labour, shall be other than a _passive_ citizen: not the\r\n      slightest vote for him; were he _acting_, all the year round,\r\n      with sledge hammer, with forest-levelling axe! Unheard of! cry\r\n      Patriot Journals. Yes truly, my Patriot Friends, if Liberty, the\r\n      passion and prayer of all men’s souls, means Liberty to send your\r\n      fifty-thousandth part of a new Tongue-fencer into National\r\n      Debating-club, then, be the gods witness, ye are hardly\r\n      entreated. Oh, if in National _Palaver_ (as the Africans name\r\n      it), such blessedness is verily found, what tyrant would deny it\r\n      to Son of Adam! Nay, might there not be a Female Parliament too,\r\n      with “screams from the Opposition benches,” and “the honourable\r\n      Member borne out in hysterics?” To a Children’s Parliament would\r\n      I gladly consent; or even lower if ye wished it. Beloved\r\n      Brothers! Liberty, one might fear, is actually, as the ancient\r\n      wise men said, of Heaven. On this Earth, where, thinks the\r\n      enlightened public, did a brave little Dame de Staal (not\r\n      Necker’s Daughter, but a far shrewder than she) find the nearest\r\n      approach to Liberty? After mature computation, cool as\r\n      Dilworth’s, her answer is, _In the Bastille._[279] ‘Of Heaven?’\r\n      answer many, asking. Wo that they should _ask;_ for that is the\r\n      very misery! ‘Of Heaven’ means much; share in the National\r\n      Palaver it may, or may as probably _not_ mean.\r\n\r\n      One Sansculottic bough that cannot fail to flourish is\r\n      Journalism. The voice of the People _being_ the voice of God,\r\n      shall not such divine voice make itself heard? To the ends of\r\n      France; and in as many dialects as when the _first_ great Babel\r\n      was to be built! Some loud as the lion; some small as the sucking\r\n      dove. Mirabeau himself has his instructive Journal or Journals,\r\n      with Geneva hodmen working in them; and withal has quarrels\r\n      enough with Dame le Jay, his Female Bookseller, so\r\n      ultra-compliant otherwise.[280]\r\n\r\n      _King’s-friend_ Royou still prints himself. Barrère sheds tears\r\n      of loyal sensibility in _Break of Day_ Journal, though with\r\n      declining sale. But why is Fréron so hot, democratic; Fréron, the\r\n      King’s-friend’s Nephew? He has it by kind, that heat of his:\r\n      _wasp_ Fréron begot him; Voltaire’s _Frélon;_ who fought\r\n      stinging, while sting and poison-bag were left, were it only as\r\n      Reviewer, and over Printed Waste-paper. Constant, illuminative,\r\n      as the nightly lamplighter, issues the useful _Moniteur_, for it\r\n      is now become diurnal: with facts and few commentaries; official,\r\n      safe in the middle:—its able Editors sunk long since, recoverably\r\n      or irrecoverably, in deep darkness. Acid Loustalot, with his\r\n      “vigour,” as of young sloes, shall never ripen, but die untimely:\r\n      his Prudhomme, however, will not let that _Révolutions de Paris_\r\n      die; but edit it himself, with much else,—dull-blustering Printer\r\n      though he be.\r\n\r\n      Of Cassandra-Marat we have spoken often; yet the most surprising\r\n      truth remains to be spoken: that he actually does not want sense;\r\n      but, with croaking gelid throat, croaks out masses of the truth,\r\n      on several things. Nay sometimes, one might almost fancy he had a\r\n      perception of humour, and were laughing a little, far down in his\r\n      inner man. Camille is wittier than ever, and more outspoken,\r\n      cynical; yet sunny as ever. A light melodious creature; “born,”\r\n      as he shall yet say with bitter tears, “to write verses;” light\r\n      Apollo, so clear, soft-lucent, in this war of the Titans, wherein\r\n      he shall not conquer!\r\n\r\n      Folded and hawked Newspapers exist in all countries; but, in such\r\n      a Journalistic element as this of France, other and stranger\r\n      sorts are to be anticipated. What says the English reader to a\r\n      _Journal-Affiche_, Placard Journal; legible to him that has no\r\n      halfpenny; in bright prismatic colours, calling the eye from\r\n      afar? Such, in the coming months, as Patriot Associations, public\r\n      and private, advance, and can subscribe funds, shall plenteously\r\n      hang themselves out: _leaves_, limed leaves, to catch what they\r\n      can! The very Government shall have its Pasted Journal; Louvet,\r\n      busy yet with a new “charming romance,” shall write\r\n      _Sentinelles_, and post them with effect; nay Bertrand de\r\n      Moleville, in his extremity, shall still more cunningly try\r\n      it.[281] Great is Journalism. Is not every Able Editor a Ruler of\r\n      the World, being a persuader of it; though self-elected, yet\r\n      sanctioned, by the sale of his Numbers? Whom indeed the world has\r\n      the readiest method of deposing, should need be: that of merely\r\n      doing _nothing_ to him; which ends in starvation!\r\n\r\n      Nor esteem it small what those Bill-stickers had to do in Paris:\r\n      above Three Score of them: all with their crosspoles, haversacks,\r\n      pastepots; nay with leaden badges, for the Municipality licenses\r\n      them. A Sacred College, properly of World-rulers’ Heralds, though\r\n      not respected as such, in an Era still incipient and raw. They\r\n      made the walls of Paris didactic, suasive, with an ever fresh\r\n      Periodical Literature, wherein he that ran might read: Placard\r\n      Journals, Placard Lampoons, Municipal Ordinances, Royal\r\n      Proclamations; the whole other or vulgar Placard-department\r\n      super-added,—or omitted from contempt! What unutterable things\r\n      the stone-walls spoke, during these five years! But it is all\r\n      gone; Today swallowing Yesterday, and then being in its turn\r\n      swallowed of Tomorrow, even as Speech ever is. Nay what, O thou\r\n      immortal Man of Letters, is Writing itself but Speech conserved\r\n      for a time? The Placard Journal conserved it for one day; some\r\n      Books conserve it for the matter of ten years; nay some for three\r\n      thousand: but what then? Why, _then_, the years being all run, it\r\n      also dies, and the world is rid of it. Oh, were there not a\r\n      spirit in the word of man, as in man himself, that survived the\r\n      audible bodied word, and tended either Godward, or else Devilward\r\n      for evermore, why should he trouble himself much with the truth\r\n      of it, or the falsehood of it, except for commercial purposes?\r\n      His immortality indeed, and whether it shall last half a\r\n      lifetime, or a lifetime and half; is not that a very considerable\r\n      thing? As mortality, was to the runaway, whom Great Fritz bullied\r\n      back into the battle with a: ‘_R—, wollt ihr ewig leben_,\r\n      Unprintable Off-scouring of Scoundrels, would ye live for ever!’\r\n\r\n      This is the Communication of Thought: how happy when there is any\r\n      Thought to communicate! Neither let the simpler old methods be\r\n      neglected, in their sphere. The Palais-Royal Tent, a tyrannous\r\n      Patrollotism has removed; but can it remove the lungs of man?\r\n      Anaxagoras Chaumette we saw mounted on bourne-stones, while\r\n      Tallien worked sedentary at the subeditorial desk. In any corner\r\n      of the civilised world, a tub can be inverted, and an\r\n      articulate-speaking biped mount thereon. Nay, with contrivance, a\r\n      portable trestle, or folding-stool, can be procured, for love or\r\n      money; this the peripatetic Orator can take in his hand, and,\r\n      driven out here, set it up again there; saying mildly, with a\r\n      Sage Bias, _Omnia mea mecum porto._\r\n\r\n      Such is Journalism, hawked, pasted, spoken. How changed since One\r\n      old Métra walked this same Tuileries Garden, in gilt cocked hat,\r\n      with Journal at his nose, or held loose-folded behind his back;\r\n      and was a notability of Paris, “Métra the Newsman;”[282] and\r\n      Louis himself was wont to say: _Qu’en dit Métra?_ Since the first\r\n      Venetian News-sheet was sold for a _gazza_, or farthing, and\r\n      named _Gazette!_ We live in a fertile world.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.V.\r\n      Clubbism.\r\n\r\n      Where the heart is full, it seeks, for a thousand reasons, in a\r\n      thousand ways, to impart itself. How sweet, indispensable, in\r\n      such cases, is fellowship; soul mystically strengthening soul!\r\n      The meditative Germans, some think, have been of opinion that\r\n      Enthusiasm in the general means simply excessive\r\n      Congregating—_Schwärmerey_, or _Swarming_. At any rate, do we not\r\n      see glimmering half-red embers, if laid _together_, get into the\r\n      brightest white glow?\r\n\r\n      In such a France, gregarious Reunions will needs multiply,\r\n      intensify; French Life will step out of doors, and, from\r\n      domestic, become a public Club Life. Old Clubs, which already\r\n      germinated, grow and flourish; new every where bud forth. It is\r\n      the sure symptom of Social Unrest: in such way, most infallibly\r\n      of all, does Social Unrest exhibit itself; find solacement, and\r\n      also nutriment. In every French head there hangs now, whether for\r\n      terror or for hope, some prophetic picture of a New France:\r\n      prophecy which brings, nay which almost is, its own fulfilment;\r\n      and in all ways, consciously and unconsciously, works towards\r\n      that.\r\n\r\n      Observe, moreover, how the Aggregative Principle, let it be but\r\n      deep enough, goes on aggregating, and this even in a geometrical\r\n      progression: how when the whole world, in such a plastic time, is\r\n      forming itself into Clubs, some One Club, the strongest or\r\n      luckiest, shall, by friendly attracting, by victorious\r\n      compelling, grow ever stronger, till it become immeasurably\r\n      strong; and all the others, with their strength, be either\r\n      lovingly absorbed into it, or hostilely abolished by it! This if\r\n      the Club-spirit is universal; if the time _is_ plastic. Plastic\r\n      enough is the time, universal the Club-spirit: such an all\r\n      absorbing, paramount One Club cannot be wanting.\r\n\r\n      What a progress, since the first salient-point of the Breton\r\n      Committee! It worked long in secret, not languidly; it has come\r\n      with the National Assembly to Paris; calls itself _Club;_ calls\r\n      itself in imitation, as is thought, of those generous\r\n      Price-Stanhope English, _French Revolution Club;_ but soon, with\r\n      more originality, _Club of Friends of the Constitution._ Moreover\r\n      it has leased, for itself, at a fair rent, the Hall of the\r\n      Jacobin’s Convent, one of our “superfluous edifices;” and does\r\n      therefrom now, in these spring months, begin shining out on an\r\n      admiring Paris. And so, by degrees, under the shorter popular\r\n      title of _Jacobins’ Club_, it shall become memorable to all times\r\n      and lands. Glance into the interior: strongly yet modestly\r\n      benched and seated; as many as Thirteen Hundred chosen Patriots;\r\n      Assembly Members not a few. Barnave, the two Lameths are seen\r\n      there; occasionally Mirabeau, perpetually Robespierre; also the\r\n      ferret-visage of Fouquier-Tinville with other attorneys;\r\n      Anacharsis of Prussian Scythia, and miscellaneous\r\n      Patriots,—though all is yet in the most perfectly clean-washed\r\n      state; decent, nay dignified. President on platform, President’s\r\n      bell are not wanting; oratorical Tribune high-raised; nor\r\n      strangers’ galleries, wherein also sit women. Has any French\r\n      Antiquarian Society preserved that written Lease of the Jacobins\r\n      Convent Hall? Or was it, unluckier even than Magna Charta,\r\n      _clipt_ by sacrilegious Tailors? Universal History is not\r\n      indifferent to it.\r\n\r\n      These Friends of the Constitution have met mainly, as their name\r\n      may foreshadow, to look after Elections when an Election comes,\r\n      and procure fit men; but likewise to consult generally that the\r\n      Commonweal take no damage; one as yet sees not how. For indeed\r\n      let two or three gather together any where, if it be not in\r\n      Church, where all are bound to the _passive_ state; no mortal can\r\n      say accurately, themselves as little as any, for _what_ they are\r\n      gathered. How often has the broached barrel proved not to be for\r\n      joy and heart effusion, but for duel and head-breakage; and the\r\n      promised feast become a Feast of the Lapithae! This Jacobins\r\n      Club, which at first shone resplendent, and was thought to be a\r\n      new celestial Sun for enlightening the Nations, had, as things\r\n      all have, to work through its appointed phases: it burned\r\n      unfortunately more and more lurid, more sulphurous,\r\n      distracted;—and swam at last, through the astonished Heaven, like\r\n      a Tartarean Portent, and lurid-burning Prison of Spirits in Pain.\r\n\r\n      Its style of eloquence? Rejoice, Reader, that thou knowest it\r\n      not, that thou canst never perfectly know. The Jacobins published\r\n      a Journal of Debates, where they that have the heart may examine:\r\n      Impassioned, full-droning Patriotic-eloquence; implacable,\r\n      unfertile—save for Destruction, which was indeed its work: most\r\n      wearisome, though most deadly. Be thankful that Oblivion covers\r\n      so much; that all carrion is by and by buried in the green\r\n      Earth’s bosom, and even makes her grow the greener. The Jacobins\r\n      are buried; but their work is not; it continues “making the tour\r\n      of the world,” as it can. It might be seen lately, for instance,\r\n      with bared bosom and death-defiant eye, as far on as Greek\r\n      Missolonghi; and, strange enough, old slumbering Hellas was\r\n      resuscitated, into _somnambulism_ which will become clear\r\n      wakefulness, by a voice from the Rue St. Honoré! All dies, as we\r\n      often say; except the spirit of man, of what man _does_. Thus has\r\n      not the very House of the Jacobins vanished; scarcely lingering\r\n      in a few old men’s memories? The St. Honoré Market has brushed it\r\n      away, and now where dull-droning eloquence, like a Trump of Doom,\r\n      once shook the world, there is pacific chaffering for poultry and\r\n      greens. The sacred National Assembly Hall itself has become\r\n      common ground; President’s platform permeable to wain and\r\n      dustcart; for the Rue de Rivoli runs there. Verily, at Cockcrow\r\n      (of this Cock or the other), _all_ Apparitions do melt and\r\n      dissolve in space.\r\n\r\n      The Paris _Jacobins_ became “the Mother-Society, _Société-Mère;_”\r\n      and had as many as “three hundred” shrill-tongued daughters in\r\n      “direct correspondence” with her. Of indirectly corresponding,\r\n      what we may call grand-daughters and minute progeny, she counted\r\n      “forty-four thousand!”—But for the present we note only two\r\n      things: the first of them a mere anecdote. One night, a couple of\r\n      brother Jacobins are doorkeepers; for the members take this post\r\n      of duty and honour in rotation, and admit none that have not\r\n      tickets: one doorkeeper was the worthy Sieur Laïs, a patriotic\r\n      Opera-singer, stricken in years, whose windpipe is long since\r\n      closed without result; the other, young, and named Louis\r\n      Philippe, D’Orléans’s firstborn, has in this latter time, after\r\n      unheard-of destinies, become Citizen-King, and struggles to rule\r\n      for a season. All-flesh is grass; higher reedgrass or creeping\r\n      herb.\r\n\r\n      The second thing we have to note is historical: that the\r\n      Mother-Society, even in this its effulgent period, cannot content\r\n      all Patriots. Already it must throw off, so to speak, two\r\n      dissatisfied swarms; a swarm to the right, a swarm to the left.\r\n      One party, which thinks the Jacobins lukewarm, constitutes itself\r\n      into _Club of the Cordeliers;_ a hotter Club: it is Danton’s\r\n      element: with whom goes Desmoulins. The other party, again, which\r\n      thinks the Jacobins scalding-hot, flies off to the right, and\r\n      becomes “Club of 1789, Friends of the _Monarchic_ Constitution.”\r\n      They are afterwards named “_Feuillans Club;_” their place of\r\n      meeting being the Feuillans Convent. Lafayette is, or becomes,\r\n      their chief-man; supported by the respectable Patriot everywhere,\r\n      by the mass of Property and Intelligence,—with the most\r\n      flourishing prospects. They, in these June days of 1790, do, in\r\n      the Palais Royal, dine solemnly with open windows; to the cheers\r\n      of the people; with toasts, with inspiriting songs,—with one song\r\n      at least, among the feeblest ever sung.[283] They shall, in due\r\n      time be hooted forth, over the borders, into Cimmerian Night.\r\n\r\n      Another expressly Monarchic or Royalist Club, “_Club des\r\n      Monarchiens_,” though a Club of ample funds, and all sitting in\r\n      damask sofas, cannot realise the smallest momentary cheer;\r\n      realises only scoffs and groans;—till, ere long, certain Patriots\r\n      in disorderly sufficient number, proceed thither, for a night or\r\n      for nights, and groan it out of pain. Vivacious alone shall the\r\n      Mother-Society and her family be. The very Cordeliers may, as it\r\n      were, return into her bosom, which will have grown warm enough.\r\n\r\n      Fatal-looking! Are not such Societies an incipient New Order of\r\n      Society itself? The Aggregative Principle anew at work in a\r\n      Society grown obsolete, cracked asunder, dissolving into rubbish\r\n      and primary atoms?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.VI.\r\n      Je le jure.\r\n\r\n      With these signs of the times, is it not surprising that the\r\n      dominant feeling all over France was still continually Hope? O\r\n      blessed Hope, sole boon of man; whereby, on his strait prison\r\n      walls, are painted beautiful far-stretching landscapes; and into\r\n      the night of very Death is shed holiest dawn! Thou art to all an\r\n      indefeasible possession in this God’s-world: to the wise a sacred\r\n      Constantine’s-banner, written on the eternal skies; under which\r\n      they _shall_ conquer, for the battle itself is victory: to the\r\n      foolish some secular _mirage_, or shadow of still waters, painted\r\n      on the parched Earth; whereby at least their dusty pilgrimage, if\r\n      devious, becomes cheerfuller, becomes possible.\r\n\r\n      In the death-tumults of a sinking Society, French Hope sees only\r\n      the birth-struggles of a new unspeakably better Society; and\r\n      sings, with full assurance of faith, her brisk Melody, which some\r\n      inspired fiddler has in these very days composed for her,—the\r\n      world-famous _Ça-ira_. Yes; “that will go:” and then there will\r\n      _come—?_ All men hope: even Marat hopes—that Patriotism will take\r\n      muff and dirk. King Louis is not without hope: in the chapter of\r\n      chances; in a flight to some Bouillé; in getting popularized at\r\n      Paris. But what a hoping People he had, judge by the fact, and\r\n      series of facts, now to be noted.\r\n\r\n      Poor Louis, meaning the best, with little insight and even less\r\n      determination of his own, has to follow, in that dim wayfaring of\r\n      his, such signal as may be given him; by backstairs Royalism, by\r\n      official or backstairs Constitutionalism, whichever for the month\r\n      may have convinced the royal mind. If flight to Bouillé, and\r\n      (horrible to think!) a drawing of the civil sword do hang as\r\n      theory, portentous in the background, much nearer is this fact of\r\n      these Twelve Hundred Kings, who sit in the _Salle de Manége_.\r\n      Kings uncontrollable by him, not yet irreverent to him. Could\r\n      kind management of these but prosper, how much better were it\r\n      than armed Emigrants, Turin-intrigues, and the help of Austria!\r\n      Nay, are the _two_ hopes inconsistent? Rides in the suburbs, we\r\n      have found, cost little; yet they always brought _vivats_.[284]\r\n      Still cheaper is a soft word; such as has many times turned away\r\n      wrath. In these rapid days, while France is all getting divided\r\n      into Departments, Clergy about to be remodelled, Popular\r\n      Societies rising, and Feudalism and so much ever is ready to be\r\n      hurled into the melting-pot,—might one not try?\r\n\r\n      On the 4th of February, accordingly, M. le Président reads to his\r\n      National Assembly a short autograph, announcing that his Majesty\r\n      will step over, quite in an unceremonious way, probably about\r\n      noon. Think, therefore, Messieurs, what it may mean; especially,\r\n      how ye will get the Hall decorated a little. The Secretaries’\r\n      Bureau can be shifted down from the platform; on the President’s\r\n      chair be slipped this cover of velvet, “of a violet colour\r\n      sprigged with gold fleur-de-lys;”—for indeed M. le Président has\r\n      had previous notice underhand, and taken counsel with Doctor\r\n      Guillotin. Then some fraction of “velvet carpet,” of like texture\r\n      and colour, cannot that be spread in front of the chair, where\r\n      the Secretaries usually sit? So has judicious Guillotin advised:\r\n      and the effect is found satisfactory. Moreover, as it is probable\r\n      that his Majesty, in spite of the fleur-de-lys-velvet, will stand\r\n      and not sit at all, the President himself, in the interim,\r\n      presides standing. And so, while some honourable Member is\r\n      discussing, say, the division of a Department, Ushers announce:\r\n      ‘His Majesty!’ In person, with small suite, enter Majesty: the\r\n      honourable Member stops short; the Assembly starts to its feet;\r\n      the Twelve Hundred Kings “almost all,” and the Galleries no less,\r\n      do welcome the Restorer of French Liberty with loyal shouts. His\r\n      Majesty’s Speech, in diluted conventional phraseology, expresses\r\n      this mainly: That he, most of all Frenchmen, rejoices to see\r\n      France getting regenerated; is sure, at the same time, that they\r\n      will deal gently with her in the process, and not regenerate her\r\n      _roughly_. Such was his Majesty’s Speech: the feat he performed\r\n      was coming to speak it, and going back again.\r\n\r\n      Surely, except to a very hoping People, there was not much here\r\n      to build upon. Yet what did they not build! The fact that the\r\n      King has spoken, that he has voluntarily come to speak, how\r\n      inexpressibly encouraging! Did not the glance of his royal\r\n      countenance, like concentrated sunbeams, kindle all hearts in an\r\n      august Assembly; nay thereby in an inflammable enthusiastic\r\n      France? To move “Deputation of thanks” can be the happy lot of\r\n      but one man; to go in such Deputation the lot of not many. The\r\n      Deputed have gone, and returned with what highest-flown\r\n      compliment they could; whom also the Queen met, Dauphin in hand.\r\n      And still do not our hearts burn with insatiable gratitude; and\r\n      to one other man a still higher blessedness suggests itself: To\r\n      move that we all renew the National Oath.\r\n\r\n      Happiest honourable Member, with his word so in season as word\r\n      seldom was; magic Fugleman of a whole National Assembly, which\r\n      sat there bursting to do somewhat; Fugleman of a whole onlooking\r\n      France! The President swears; declares that every one shall\r\n      swear, in distinct _je le jure_. Nay the very Gallery sends him\r\n      down a written slip signed, with their Oath on it; and as the\r\n      Assembly now casts an eye that way, the Gallery all stands up and\r\n      swears again. And then out of doors, consider at the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville how Bailly, the great Tennis-Court swearer, again\r\n      swears, towards nightful, with all the Municipals, and Heads of\r\n      Districts assembled there. And “M. Danton suggests that the\r\n      public would like to partake:” whereupon Bailly, with escort of\r\n      Twelve, steps forth to the great outer staircase; sways the\r\n      ebullient multitude with stretched hand: takes their oath, with a\r\n      thunder of “rolling drums,” with shouts that rend the welkin. And\r\n      on all streets the glad people, with moisture and fire in their\r\n      eyes, “spontaneously formed groups, and swore one\r\n      another,”[285]—and the whole City was illuminated. This was the\r\n      Fourth of February 1790: a day to be marked white in\r\n      Constitutional annals.\r\n\r\n      Nor is the illumination for a night only, but partially or\r\n      totally it lasts a series of nights. For each District, the\r\n      Electors of each District, will swear specially; and always as\r\n      the District swears; it illuminates itself. Behold them, District\r\n      after District, in some open square, where the Non-Electing\r\n      People can all see and join: with their uplifted right hands, and\r\n      _je le jure:_ with rolling drums, with embracings, and that\r\n      infinite hurrah of the enfranchised,—which any tyrant that there\r\n      may be can consider! Faithful to the King, to the Law, to the\r\n      Constitution which the National Assembly _shall_ make.\r\n\r\n      Fancy, for example, the Professors of Universities parading the\r\n      streets with their young France, and swearing, in an enthusiastic\r\n      manner, not without tumult. By a larger exercise of fancy, expand\r\n      duly this little word: The like was repeated in every Town and\r\n      District of France! Nay one Patriot Mother, in Lagnon of\r\n      Brittany, assembles her ten children; and, with her own aged\r\n      hand, swears them all herself, the highsouled venerable woman. Of\r\n      all which, moreover, a National Assembly must be eloquently\r\n      apprised. Such three weeks of swearing! Saw the sun ever such a\r\n      swearing people? Have they been bit by a swearing tarantula? No:\r\n      but they are men and Frenchmen; they have Hope; and, singular to\r\n      say, they have Faith, were it only in the Gospel according to\r\n      Jean Jacques. O my Brothers! would to Heaven it were even as ye\r\n      think and have sworn! But there are Lovers’ Oaths, which, had\r\n      they been true as love itself, _cannot_ be kept; not to speak of\r\n      Dicers’ Oaths, also a known sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.VII.\r\n      Prodigies.\r\n\r\n      To such length had the _Contrat Social_ brought it, in believing\r\n      hearts. Man, as is well said, lives by faith; each generation has\r\n      its own faith, more or less; and laughs at the faith of its\r\n      predecessor,—most unwisely. Grant indeed that this faith in the\r\n      Social Contract belongs to the stranger sorts; that an unborn\r\n      generation may very wisely, if not laugh, yet stare at it, and\r\n      piously consider. For, alas, what is _Contrat?_ If all men were\r\n      such that a mere spoken or sworn Contract would bind them, all\r\n      men were then true men, and Government a superfluity. Not what\r\n      thou and I have promised to each other, but what the balance of\r\n      our forces can make us perform to each other: that, in so sinful\r\n      a world as ours, is the thing to be counted on. But above all, a\r\n      People and a Sovereign promising to one another; as if a whole\r\n      People, changing from generation to generation, nay from hour to\r\n      hour, could ever by any method be made to _speak_ or promise; and\r\n      to speak mere solecisms:‘We, be the Heavens witness, which\r\n      Heavens however do no miracles now; we, ever-changing Millions,\r\n      will _allow_ thee, changeful Unit, to _force_ us or govern us!’\r\n      The world has perhaps seen few faiths comparable to that.\r\n\r\n      So nevertheless had the world then construed the matter. Had they\r\n      _not_ so construed it, how different had their hopes been, their\r\n      attempts, their results! But so and not otherwise did the Upper\r\n      Powers will it to be. Freedom by Social Contract: such was verily\r\n      the Gospel of that Era. And all men had believed in it, as in a\r\n      Heaven’s Glad-tidings men should; and with overflowing heart and\r\n      uplifted voice clave to it, and stood fronting Time and Eternity\r\n      on it. Nay smile not; or only with a smile sadder than tears!\r\n      This too was a better faith than the one it had replaced: than\r\n      faith merely in the Everlasting Nothing and man’s Digestive\r\n      Power; lower than _which_ no faith can go.\r\n\r\n      Not that such universally prevalent, universally jurant, feeling\r\n      of Hope, could be a unanimous one. Far from that! The time was\r\n      ominous: social dissolution near and certain; social renovation\r\n      still a problem, difficult and distant even though sure. But if\r\n      ominous to some clearest onlooker, whose faith stood not with one\r\n      side or with the other, nor in the ever-vexed jarring of Greek\r\n      with Greek at all,—how unspeakably ominous to dim Royalist\r\n      participators; for whom Royalism was Mankind’s palladium; for\r\n      whom, with the abolition of Most-Christian Kingship and\r\n      Most-Talleyrand Bishopship, all loyal obedience, all religious\r\n      faith was to expire, and final Night envelope the Destinies of\r\n      Man! On serious hearts, of that persuasion, the matter sinks down\r\n      deep; prompting, as we have seen, to backstairs Plots, to\r\n      Emigration with pledge of war, to Monarchic Clubs; nay to still\r\n      madder things.\r\n\r\n      The Spirit of Prophecy, for instance, had been considered extinct\r\n      for some centuries: nevertheless these last-times, as indeed is\r\n      the tendency of last-times, do revive it; that so, of French mad\r\n      things, we might have sample also of the maddest. In remote rural\r\n      districts, whither Philosophism has not yet radiated, where a\r\n      heterodox Constitution of the Clergy is bringing strife round the\r\n      altar itself, and the very Church-bells are getting melted into\r\n      small money-coin, it appears probable that the End of the World\r\n      cannot be far off. Deep-musing atrabiliar old men, especially old\r\n      women, hint in an obscure way that they know what they know. The\r\n      Holy Virgin, silent so long, has not gone dumb;—and truly now, if\r\n      ever more in this world, were the time for her to speak. One\r\n      Prophetess, though careless Historians have omitted her name,\r\n      condition, and whereabout, becomes audible to the general ear;\r\n      credible to not a few: credible to Friar Gerle, poor Patriot\r\n      Chartreux, in the National Assembly itself! She, in Pythoness’\r\n      recitative, with wildstaring eye, sings that there shall be a\r\n      Sign; that the heavenly Sun himself will hang out a Sign, or\r\n      Mock-Sun,—which, many say, shall be stamped with the Head of\r\n      hanged Favras. List, Dom Gerle, with that poor addled poll of\r\n      thine; list, O list;—and hear nothing.[286]\r\n\r\n      Notable however was that “magnetic vellum, _vélin magnétique_,”\r\n      of the Sieurs d’Hozier and Petit-Jean, Parlementeers of Rouen.\r\n      Sweet young d’Hozier, “bred in the faith of his Missal, and of\r\n      parchment genealogies,” and of parchment generally: adust,\r\n      melancholic, middle-aged Petit-Jean: why came these two to\r\n      Saint-Cloud, where his Majesty was hunting, on the festival of\r\n      St. Peter and St. Paul; and waited there, in antechambers, a\r\n      wonder to whispering Swiss, the livelong day; and even waited\r\n      without the Grates, when turned out; and had dismissed their\r\n      valets to Paris, as with purpose of endless waiting? They have a\r\n      _magnetic vellum_, these two; whereon the Virgin, wonderfully\r\n      clothing herself in Mesmerean Cagliostric Occult-Philosophy, has\r\n      inspired them to jot down instructions and predictions for a\r\n      much-straitened King. To whom, by Higher Order, they will this\r\n      day present it; and save the Monarchy and World. Unaccountable\r\n      pair of visual-objects! Ye should be men, and of the Eighteenth\r\n      Century; but your magnetic vellum forbids us so to interpret.\r\n      Say, are ye aught? Thus ask the Guardhouse Captains, the Mayor of\r\n      St. Cloud; nay, at great length, thus asks the Committee of\r\n      Researches, and not the Municipal, but the National Assembly one.\r\n      No distinct answer, for weeks. At last it becomes plain that the\r\n      right answer is _negative_. Go, ye Chimeras, with your magnetic\r\n      vellum; sweet young Chimera, adust middle-aged one! The\r\n      Prison-doors are open. Hardly again shall ye preside the Rouen\r\n      Chamber of Accounts; but vanish obscurely into Limbo.[287]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.VIII.\r\n      Solemn League and Covenant.\r\n\r\n      Such dim masses, and specks of even deepest black, work in that\r\n      white-hot glow of the French mind, now wholly in fusion, and\r\n      _con_fusion. Old women here swearing their ten children on the\r\n      new Evangel of Jean Jacques; old women there looking up for\r\n      Favras’ Heads in the celestial Luminary: these _are_\r\n      preternatural signs, prefiguring somewhat.\r\n\r\n      In fact, to the Patriot children of Hope themselves, it is\r\n      undeniable that difficulties exist: emigrating Seigneurs;\r\n      Parlements in sneaking but most malicious mutiny (though the rope\r\n      is round their neck); above all, the most decided “deficiency of\r\n      grains.” Sorrowful: but, to a Nation that hopes, not\r\n      irremediable. To a Nation which is in fusion and ardent communion\r\n      of thought; which, for example, on signal of one Fugleman, will\r\n      lift its right hand like a drilled regiment, and swear and\r\n      illuminate, till every village from Ardennes to the Pyrenees has\r\n      rolled its village-drum, and sent up its little oath, and glimmer\r\n      of tallow-illumination some fathoms into the reign of Night!\r\n\r\n      If grains are defective, the fault is not of Nature or National\r\n      Assembly, but of Art and Antinational Intriguers. Such malign\r\n      individuals, of the scoundrel species, have power to vex us,\r\n      while the Constitution is a-making. Endure it, ye heroic\r\n      Patriots: nay rather, why not cure it? Grains do grow, they lie\r\n      extant there in sheaf or sack; only that regraters and Royalist\r\n      plotters, to provoke the people into illegality, obstruct the\r\n      transport of grains. Quick, ye organised Patriot Authorities,\r\n      armed National Guards, meet together; unite your goodwill; in\r\n      union is tenfold strength: let the concentred flash of your\r\n      Patriotism strike stealthy Scoundrelism blind, paralytic, as with\r\n      a _coup de soleil._\r\n\r\n      Under which hat or nightcap of the Twenty-five millions, this\r\n      pregnant Idea first rose, for in some one head it did rise, no\r\n      man can now say. A most small idea, near at hand for the whole\r\n      world: but a living one, fit; and which waxed, whether into\r\n      greatness or not, into immeasurable size. When a Nation is in\r\n      this state that the Fugleman can operate on it, what will the\r\n      word in season, the act in season, not do! It will grow verily,\r\n      like the Boy’s Bean in the Fairy-Tale, heaven-high, with\r\n      habitations and adventures on it, in one night. It is\r\n      nevertheless unfortunately still a Bean (for your long-lived Oak\r\n      grows _not_ so); and, the next night, it may lie felled,\r\n      horizontal, trodden into common mud.—But remark, at least, how\r\n      natural to any agitated Nation, which has Faith, this business of\r\n      Covenanting is. The Scotch, believing in a righteous Heaven above\r\n      them, and also in a Gospel, far other than the Jean-Jacques one,\r\n      swore, in their extreme need, a Solemn League and Covenant,—as\r\n      Brothers on the forlorn-hope, and imminence of battle, who\r\n      embrace looking Godward; and got the whole Isle to swear it; and\r\n      even, in their tough Old-Saxon Hebrew-Presbyterian way, to keep\r\n      it more or less;—for the thing, as such things are, was heard in\r\n      Heaven, and partially ratified there; neither is it yet dead, if\r\n      thou wilt look, nor like to die. The French too, with their\r\n      Gallic-Ethnic excitability and effervescence, have, as we have\r\n      seen, real Faith, of a sort; they are hard bestead, though in the\r\n      middle of Hope: a National Solemn League and Covenant there may\r\n      be in France too; under how different conditions; with how\r\n      different developement and issue!\r\n\r\n      Note, accordingly, the small commencement; first spark of a\r\n      mighty firework: for if the particular _hat_ cannot be fixed\r\n      upon, the particular District can. On the 29th day of last\r\n      November, were National Guards by the thousand seen filing, from\r\n      far and near, with military music, with Municipal officers in\r\n      tricolor sashes, towards and along the Rhone-stream, to the\r\n      little town of Etoile. There with ceremonial evolution and\r\n      manœuvre, with fanfaronading, musketry-salvoes, and what else the\r\n      Patriot genius could devise, they made oath and obtestation to\r\n      stand faithfully by one another, under Law and King; in\r\n      particular, to have all manner of grains, while grains there\r\n      were, freely circulated, in spite both of robber and regrater.\r\n      This was the meeting of Etoile, in the mild end of November 1789.\r\n\r\n      But now, if a mere empty Review, followed by Review-dinner, ball,\r\n      and such gesticulation and flirtation as there may be, interests\r\n      the happy County-town, and makes it the envy of surrounding\r\n      County-towns, how much more might this! In a fortnight, larger\r\n      Montélimart, half ashamed of itself, will do as good, and better.\r\n      On the Plain of Montélimart, or what is equally sonorous, “under\r\n      the Walls of Montélimart,” the thirteenth of December sees new\r\n      gathering and obtestation; six thousand strong; and now indeed,\r\n      with these three remarkable improvements, as unanimously resolved\r\n      on there. First that the men of Montélimart do federate with the\r\n      already federated men of Etoile. Second, that, implying not\r\n      expressing the circulation of grain, they “swear in the face of\r\n      God and their Country” with much more emphasis and\r\n      comprehensiveness, “to obey all decrees of the National Assembly,\r\n      and see them obeyed, till death, _jusqu’à la mort_.” Third, and\r\n      most important, that official record of all this be solemnly\r\n      delivered in to the National Assembly, to M. de Lafayette, and\r\n      “to the Restorer of French Liberty;” who shall all take what\r\n      comfort from it they can. Thus does larger Montélimart vindicate\r\n      its Patriot importance, and maintain its rank in the municipal\r\n      scale.[288]\r\n\r\n      And so, with the New-year, the signal is hoisted; for is not a\r\n      National Assembly, and solemn deliverance there, at lowest a\r\n      National Telegraph? Not only grain shall circulate, while there\r\n      is grain, on highways or the Rhone-waters, over all that\r\n      South-Eastern region,—where also if Monseigneur d’Artois saw good\r\n      to break in from Turin, hot welcome might wait him; but\r\n      whatsoever Province of France is straitened for grain, or vexed\r\n      with a mutinous Parlement, unconstitutional plotters, Monarchic\r\n      Clubs, or any other Patriot ailment,—can go and do likewise, or\r\n      even do better. And now, especially, when the February swearing\r\n      has set them all agog! From Brittany to Burgundy, on most plains\r\n      of France, under most City-walls, it is a blaring of trumpets,\r\n      waving of banners, a constitutional manœuvring: under the vernal\r\n      skies, while Nature too is putting forth her green Hopes, under\r\n      bright sunshine defaced by the stormful East; like Patriotism\r\n      victorious, though with difficulty, over Aristocracy and defect\r\n      of grain! There march and constitutionally wheel, to the\r\n      _ça-ira_-ing mood of fife and drum, under their tricolor\r\n      Municipals, our clear-gleaming Phalanxes; or halt, with uplifted\r\n      right-hand, and artillery-salvoes that imitate Jove’s thunder;\r\n      and all the Country, and metaphorically all “the Universe,” is\r\n      looking on. Wholly, in their best apparel, brave men, and\r\n      beautifully dizened women, most of whom have lovers there;\r\n      swearing, by the eternal Heavens and this green-growing\r\n      all-nutritive Earth, that France is free!\r\n\r\n      Sweetest days, when (astonishing to say) mortals have actually\r\n      met together in communion and fellowship; and man, were it only\r\n      once through long despicable centuries, is for moments verily the\r\n      brother of man!—And then the Deputations to the National\r\n      Assembly, with highflown descriptive harangue; to M. de\r\n      Lafayette, and the Restorer; very frequently moreover to the\r\n      Mother of Patriotism sitting on her stout benches in that Hall of\r\n      the Jacobins! The general ear is filled with Federation. New\r\n      names of Patriots emerge, which shall one day become familiar:\r\n      Boyer-Fonfrede eloquent denunciator of a rebellious Bourdeaux\r\n      Parlement; Max Isnard eloquent reporter of the Federation of\r\n      Draguignan; eloquent pair, separated by the whole breadth of\r\n      France, who are nevertheless to meet. Ever wider burns the flame\r\n      of Federation; ever wider and also brighter. Thus the Brittany\r\n      and Anjou brethren mention a Fraternity of _all_ true Frenchmen;\r\n      and go the length of invoking “perdition and death” on any\r\n      renegade: moreover, if in their National-Assembly harangue, they\r\n      glance plaintively at the _marc d’argent_ which makes so many\r\n      citizens _passive_, they, over in the Mother-Society, ask, being\r\n      henceforth themselves “neither Bretons nor Angevins but French,”\r\n      Why all France has not one Federation, and universal Oath of\r\n      Brotherhood, once for all?[289] A most pertinent suggestion;\r\n      dating from the end of March. Which pertinent suggestion the\r\n      whole Patriot world cannot but catch, and reverberate and agitate\r\n      till it become _loud;_—which, in that case, the Townhall\r\n      Municipals had better take up, and meditate.\r\n\r\n      Some universal Federation seems inevitable: the Where is given;\r\n      clearly Paris: only the When, the How? These also productive Time\r\n      will give; is already giving. For always as the Federative work\r\n      goes on, it perfects itself, and Patriot genius adds contribution\r\n      after contribution. Thus, at Lyons, in the end of the May month,\r\n      we behold as many as fifty, or some say sixty thousand, met to\r\n      federate; and a multitude looking on, which it would be difficult\r\n      to number. From dawn to dusk! For our Lyons Guardsmen took rank,\r\n      at five in the bright dewy morning; came pouring in,\r\n      bright-gleaming, to the Quai de Rhone, to march thence to the\r\n      Federation-field; amid wavings of hats and lady-handkerchiefs;\r\n      glad shoutings of some two hundred thousand Patriot voices and\r\n      hearts; the beautiful and brave! Among whom, courting no notice,\r\n      and yet the notablest of all, what queenlike Figure is this; with\r\n      her escort of house-friends and Champagneux the Patriot Editor;\r\n      come abroad with the earliest? Radiant with enthusiasm are those\r\n      dark eyes, is that strong Minerva-face, looking dignity and\r\n      earnest joy; joyfullest she where all are joyful. It is Roland de\r\n      la Platrière’s Wife![290] Strict elderly Roland, King’s Inspector\r\n      of Manufactures here; and now likewise, by popular choice, the\r\n      strictest of our new Lyons Municipals: a man who has gained much,\r\n      if worth and faculty be gain; but above all things, has gained to\r\n      wife Phlipon the Paris Engraver’s daughter. Reader, mark that\r\n      queenlike burgher-woman: beautiful, Amazonian-graceful to the\r\n      eye; more so to the mind. Unconscious of her worth (as all worth\r\n      is), of her greatness, of her crystal clearness; genuine, the\r\n      creature of Sincerity and Nature, in an age of Artificiality,\r\n      Pollution and Cant; there, in her still completeness, in her\r\n      still invincibility, _she_, if thou knew it, is the noblest of\r\n      all living Frenchwomen,—and will be seen, one day. O blessed\r\n      rather while unseen, even of herself! For the present she gazes,\r\n      nothing doubting, into this grand theatricality; and thinks her\r\n      young dreams are to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n      From dawn to dusk, as we said, it lasts; and truly a sight like\r\n      few. Flourishes of drums and trumpets are something: but think of\r\n      an “artificial Rock fifty feet high,” all cut into crag-steps,\r\n      not without the similitude of “shrubs!” The interior cavity, for\r\n      in sooth it is made of deal,—stands solemn, a “Temple of\r\n      Concord:” on the outer summit rises “a Statue of Liberty,”\r\n      colossal, seen for miles, with her Pike and Phrygian Cap, and\r\n      civic column; at her feet a Country’s Altar, “_Autel de la\r\n      Patrie:_”—on all which neither deal-timber nor lath and plaster,\r\n      with paint of various colours, have been spared. But fancy then\r\n      the banners all placed on the steps of the Rock; high-mass\r\n      chaunted; and the civic oath of fifty thousand: with what\r\n      volcanic outburst of sound from iron and other throats, enough to\r\n      frighten back the very Saone and Rhone; and how the brightest\r\n      fireworks, and balls, and even repasts closed in that night of\r\n      the gods![291] And so the Lyons Federation vanishes too,\r\n      swallowed of darkness;—and yet not wholly, for our brave fair\r\n      Roland was there; also she, though in the deepest privacy, writes\r\n      her Narrative of it in Champagneux’s _Courier de Lyons;_ a piece\r\n      which “circulates to the extent of sixty thousand;” which one\r\n      would like now to read.\r\n\r\n      But on the whole, Paris, we may see, will have little to devise;\r\n      will only have to borrow and apply. And then as to the day, what\r\n      day of all the calendar is fit, if the Bastille Anniversary be\r\n      not? The particular spot too, it is easy to see, must be the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars; where many a Julian the Apostate has been lifted\r\n      on bucklers, to France’s or the world’s sovereignty; and iron\r\n      Franks, loud-clanging, have responded to the voice of a\r\n      Charlemagne; and from of old mere sublimities have been familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.IX.\r\n      Symbolic.\r\n\r\n      How natural, in all decisive circumstances, is Symbolic\r\n      Representation to all kinds of men! Nay, what is man’s whole\r\n      terrestrial Life but a Symbolic Representation, and making\r\n      visible, of the Celestial invisible Force that is in him? By act\r\n      and word he strives to do it; with sincerity, if possible;\r\n      failing that, with theatricality, which latter also may have its\r\n      meaning. An Almack’s Masquerade is not nothing; in more genial\r\n      ages, your Christmas Guisings, Feasts of the Ass, Abbots of\r\n      Unreason, were a considerable something: since sport they were;\r\n      as Almacks may still be sincere wish for sport. But what, on the\r\n      other hand, must not sincere earnest have been: say, a Hebrew\r\n      Feast of Tabernacles have been! A whole Nation gathered, in the\r\n      name of the Highest, under the eye of the Highest; imagination\r\n      herself flagging under the reality; and all noblest Ceremony as\r\n      yet not grown ceremonial, but solemn, significant to the outmost\r\n      fringe! Neither, in modern private life, are theatrical scenes,\r\n      of tearful women wetting whole ells of cambric in concert, of\r\n      impassioned bushy-whiskered youth threatening suicide, and such\r\n      like, to be so entirely detested: drop thou a tear over them\r\n      thyself rather.\r\n\r\n      At any rate, one can remark that no Nation will throw-by its\r\n      work, and deliberately go out to make a scene, without meaning\r\n      something thereby. For indeed no scenic individual, with knavish\r\n      hypocritical views, will take the trouble to _soliloquise_ a\r\n      scene: and now consider, is not a scenic Nation placed precisely\r\n      in that predicament of soliloquising; for its own behoof alone;\r\n      to solace its own sensibilities, maudlin or other?—Yet in this\r\n      respect, of readiness for scenes, the difference of Nations, as\r\n      of men, is very great. If our Saxon-Puritanic friends, for\r\n      example, swore and signed their National Covenant, without\r\n      discharge of gunpowder, or the beating of any drum, in a dingy\r\n      Covenant-Close of the Edinburgh High-street, in a mean room,\r\n      where men now drink mean liquor, it was consistent with their\r\n      ways so to swear it. Our Gallic-Encyclopedic friends, again, must\r\n      have a Champ-de-Mars, seen of all the world, or universe; and\r\n      such a Scenic Exhibition, to which the Coliseum Amphitheatre was\r\n      but a stroller’s barn, as this old Globe of ours had never or\r\n      hardly ever beheld. Which method also we reckon natural, then and\r\n      there. Nor perhaps was the respective _keeping_ of these two\r\n      Oaths far out of due proportion to such respective display in\r\n      taking them: inverse proportion, namely. For the theatricality of\r\n      a People goes in a compound-ratio: ratio indeed of their\r\n      trustfulness, sociability, fervency; but then also of their\r\n      excitability, of their porosity, not _continent;_ or say, of\r\n      their explosiveness, hot-flashing, but which does not last.\r\n\r\n      How true also, once more, is it that no man or Nation of men,\r\n      _conscious_ of doing a great thing, was ever, in that thing,\r\n      doing other than a small one! O Champ-de-Mars Federation, with\r\n      three hundred drummers, twelve hundred wind-musicians, and\r\n      artillery planted on height after height to boom the tidings of\r\n      it all over France, in few minutes! Could no Atheist-Naigeon\r\n      contrive to discern, eighteen centuries off, those Thirteen most\r\n      poor mean-dressed men, at frugal Supper, in a mean Jewish\r\n      dwelling, with no symbol but hearts god-initiated into the\r\n      “Divine depth of Sorrow,” and a _Do this in remembrance of\r\n      me;_—and so cease that small difficult crowing of his, if he were\r\n      not doomed to it?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.X.\r\n      Mankind.\r\n\r\n      Pardonable are human theatricalities; nay perhaps touching, like\r\n      the passionate utterance of a tongue which with sincerity\r\n      _stammers;_ of a head which with insincerity _babbles_,—having\r\n      gone distracted. Yet, in comparison with unpremeditated outbursts\r\n      of Nature, such as an Insurrection of Women, how foisonless,\r\n      unedifying, undelightful; like small ale palled, like an\r\n      effervescence that has effervesced! Such scenes, coming of\r\n      forethought, were they world-great, and never so cunningly\r\n      devised, are at bottom mainly pasteboard and paint. But the\r\n      others are original; emitted from the great everliving heart of\r\n      Nature herself: what figure _they_ will assume is unspeakably\r\n      significant. To us, therefore, let the French National Solemn\r\n      League, and Federation, be the highest recorded triumph of the\r\n      Thespian Art; triumphant surely, since the whole Pit, which was\r\n      of Twenty-five Millions, not only claps hands, but does itself\r\n      spring on the boards and passionately set to playing there. And\r\n      being such, be it treated as such: with sincere cursory\r\n      admiration; with wonder from afar. A whole Nation gone mumming\r\n      deserves so much; but deserves not that loving minuteness a\r\n      Menadic Insurrection did. Much more let prior, and as it were,\r\n      rehearsal scenes of Federation come and go, henceforward, as they\r\n      list; and, on Plains and under City-walls, innumerable regimental\r\n      bands blare off into the Inane, without note from us.\r\n\r\n      One scene, however, the hastiest reader will momentarily pause\r\n      on: that of Anacharsis Clootz and the Collective sinful Posterity\r\n      of Adam.—For a Patriot Municipality has now, on the 4th of June,\r\n      got its plan concocted, and got it sanctioned by National\r\n      Assembly; a Patriot King assenting; to whom, were he even free to\r\n      dissent, Federative harangues, overflowing with loyalty, have\r\n      doubtless a transient sweetness. There shall come Deputed\r\n      National Guards, so many in the hundred, from each of the\r\n      Eighty-three Departments of France. Likewise from all Naval and\r\n      Military King’s Forces, shall Deputed quotas come; such\r\n      Federation of National with Royal Soldier has, taking place\r\n      spontaneously, been already seen and sanctioned. For the rest, it\r\n      is hoped, as many as forty thousand may arrive: expenses to be\r\n      borne by the Deputing District; of all which let District and\r\n      Department take thought, and elect fit men,—whom the Paris\r\n      brethren will fly to meet and welcome.\r\n\r\n      Now, therefore, judge if our Patriot Artists are busy; taking\r\n      deep counsel how to make the Scene worthy of a look from the\r\n      Universe! As many as fifteen thousand men, spade-men, barrow-men,\r\n      stone-builders, rammers, with their engineers, are at work on the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars; hollowing it out into a natural Amphitheatre, fit\r\n      for such solemnity. For one may hope it will be annual and\r\n      perennial; a “Feast of Pikes, _Fête des Piques_,” notablest among\r\n      the high-tides of the year: in any case ought not a Scenic free\r\n      Nation to have some permanent National Amphitheatre? The\r\n      Champ-de-Mars is getting hollowed out; and the daily talk and the\r\n      nightly dream in most Parisian heads is of Federation, and that\r\n      only. Federate Deputies are already under way. National Assembly,\r\n      what with its natural work, what with hearing and answering\r\n      harangues of Federates, of this Federation, will have enough to\r\n      do! Harangue of “American Committee,” among whom is that faint\r\n      figure of Paul Jones “as with the stars dim-twinkling through\r\n      it,”—come to congratulate us on the prospect of such auspicious\r\n      day. Harangue of Bastille Conquerors, come to “renounce” any\r\n      special recompense, any peculiar place at the solemnity;—since\r\n      the Centre Grenadiers rather grumble. Harangue of “Tennis-Court\r\n      Club,” who enter with far-gleaming Brass-plate, aloft on a pole,\r\n      and the Tennis-Court Oath engraved thereon; which far gleaming\r\n      Brass-plate they purpose to affix solemnly in the Versailles\r\n      original locality, on the 20th of this month, which is the\r\n      anniversary, as a deathless memorial, for some years: they will\r\n      then dine, as they come back, in the Bois de\r\n      Boulogne;[292]—cannot, however, do it without apprising the\r\n      world. To such things does the august National Assembly ever and\r\n      anon cheerfully listen, suspending its regenerative labours; and\r\n      with some touch of impromptu eloquence, make friendly reply;—as\r\n      indeed the wont has long been; for it is a gesticulating,\r\n      sympathetic People, and has a heart, and wears it on its sleeve.\r\n\r\n      In which circumstances, it occurred to the mind of Anacharsis\r\n      Clootz that while so much was embodying itself into Club or\r\n      Committee, and perorating applauded, there yet remained a greater\r\n      and greatest; of which, if _it_ also took body and perorated,\r\n      what might not the effect be: Humankind namely, _le Genre Humain_\r\n      itself! In what rapt creative moment the Thought rose in\r\n      Anacharsis’s soul; all his throes, while he went about giving\r\n      shape and birth to it; how he was sneered at by cold worldlings;\r\n      but did sneer again, being a man of polished sarcasm; and moved\r\n      to and fro persuasive in coffeehouse and soirée, and dived down\r\n      assiduous-obscure in the great deep of Paris, making his Thought\r\n      a Fact: of all this the spiritual biographies of that period say\r\n      nothing. Enough that on the 19th evening of June 1790, the Sun’s\r\n      slant rays lighted a spectacle such as our foolish little Planet\r\n      has not often had to show: Anacharsis Clootz entering the august\r\n      Salle de Manége, with the Human Species at his heels. Swedes,\r\n      Spaniards, Polacks; Turks, Chaldeans, Greeks, dwellers in\r\n      Mesopotamia: behold them all; they have come to claim place in\r\n      the grand Federation, having an undoubted interest in it.\r\n\r\n      ‘Our ambassador titles,’ said the fervid Clootz, ‘are not written\r\n      on parchment, but on the living hearts of all men.’ These\r\n      whiskered Polacks, long-flowing turbaned Ishmaelites,\r\n      astrological Chaldeans, who stand so mute here, let them plead\r\n      with you, august Senators, more eloquently than eloquence could.\r\n      They are the mute representatives of their tongue-tied,\r\n      befettered, heavy-laden Nations; who from out of that dark\r\n      bewilderment gaze wistful, amazed, with half-incredulous hope,\r\n      towards you, and this your bright light of a French Federation:\r\n      bright particular day-star, the herald of universal day. We claim\r\n      to stand there, as mute monuments, pathetically adumbrative of\r\n      much.—From bench and gallery comes “repeated applause;” for what\r\n      august Senator but is flattered even by the very shadow of Human\r\n      Species depending on him? From President Sieyes, who presides\r\n      this remarkable fortnight, in spite of his small voice, there\r\n      comes eloquent though shrill reply. Anacharsis and the\r\n      “Foreigners Committee” shall have place at the Federation; on\r\n      condition of telling their respective Peoples what they see\r\n      there. In the mean time, we invite them to the “honours of the\r\n      sitting, _honneur de la séance_.” A long-flowing Turk, for\r\n      rejoinder, bows with Eastern solemnity, and utters articulate\r\n      sounds: but owing to his imperfect knowledge of the French\r\n      dialect,[293] his words are like spilt water; the thought he had\r\n      in him remains conjectural to this day.\r\n\r\n      Anacharsis and Mankind accept the honours of the sitting; and\r\n      have forthwith, as the old Newspapers still testify, the\r\n      satisfaction to see several things. First and chief, on the\r\n      motion of Lameth, Lafayette, Saint-Fargeau and other Patriot\r\n      Nobles, let the others repugn as they will: all Titles of\r\n      Nobility, from Duke to Esquire, or lower, are henceforth\r\n      _abolished_. Then, in like manner, Livery Servants, or rather the\r\n      Livery of Servants. Neither, for the future, shall any man or\r\n      woman, self-styled noble, be “incensed,”—foolishly fumigated with\r\n      incense, in Church; as the wont has been. In a word, Feudalism\r\n      being dead these ten months, why should her empty trappings and\r\n      scutcheons survive? The very Coats-of-arms will require to be\r\n      obliterated;—and yet Cassandra Marat on this and the other\r\n      coach-panel notices that they “are but painted-over,” and\r\n      threaten to peer through again.\r\n\r\n      So that henceforth de Lafayette is but the Sieur Motier, and\r\n      Saint-Fargeau is plain Michel Lepelletier; and Mirabeau soon\r\n      after has to say huffingly, ‘With your _Riquetti_ you have set\r\n      Europe at cross-purposes for three days.’ For his Counthood is\r\n      not indifferent to this man; which indeed the admiring People\r\n      treat him with to the last. But let extreme Patriotism rejoice,\r\n      and chiefly Anacharsis and Mankind; for now it seems to be taken\r\n      for granted that one Adam is Father of us all!—\r\n\r\n      Such was, in historical accuracy, the famed feat of Anacharsis.\r\n      Thus did the most extensive of Public Bodies find a sort of\r\n      spokesman. Whereby at least we may judge of one thing: what a\r\n      humour the once sniffing mocking City of Paris and Baron Clootz\r\n      had got into; when such exhibition could appear a propriety, next\r\n      door to a sublimity. It is true, Envy did in after times, pervert\r\n      this success of Anacharsis; making him, from incidental “Speaker\r\n      of the Foreign-Nations Committee,” claim to be official permanent\r\n      “Speaker, _Orateur_, of the Human Species,” which he only\r\n      deserved to be; and alleging, calumniously, that his astrological\r\n      Chaldeans, and the rest, were a mere French tag-rag-and-bobtail\r\n      disguised for the nonce; and, in short, sneering and fleering at\r\n      him in _her_ cold barren way; all which, however, he, the man he\r\n      was, could receive on thick enough panoply, or even rebound\r\n      therefrom, and also go _his_ way.\r\n\r\n      Most extensive of Public Bodies, we may call it; and also the\r\n      most unexpected: for who could have thought to see All Nations in\r\n      the Tuileries Riding-Hall? But so it is; and truly as strange\r\n      things may happen when a whole People goes mumming and miming.\r\n      Hast not thou thyself perchance seen diademed Cleopatra, daughter\r\n      of the Ptolemies, pleading, almost with bended knee, in unheroic\r\n      tea-parlour, or dimlit retail-shop, to inflexible gross Burghal\r\n      Dignitary, for leave to reign and die; being dressed for it, and\r\n      moneyless, with small children;—while suddenly Constables have\r\n      shut the Thespian barn, and her Antony pleaded in vain? Such\r\n      visual spectra flit across this Earth, if the Thespian Stage be\r\n      rudely interfered with: but much more, when, as was said, Pit\r\n      jumps on Stage, then is it verily, as in Herr Tieck’s Drama, a\r\n      _Verkehrte Welt_, of World Topsy-turvied!\r\n\r\n      Having seen the Human Species itself, to have seen the “_Dean_ of\r\n      the Human Species,” ceased now to be a miracle. Such “_Doyen du\r\n      Genre Humain_, Eldest of Men,” had shewn himself there, in these\r\n      weeks: Jean Claude Jacob, a born Serf, deputed from his native\r\n      Jura Mountains to thank the National Assembly for enfranchising\r\n      them. On his bleached worn face are ploughed the furrowings of\r\n      one hundred and twenty years. He has heard dim _patois_-talk, of\r\n      immortal Grand-Monarch victories; of a burnt Palatinate, as _he_\r\n      toiled and moiled to make a little speck of this Earth greener;\r\n      of Cevennes Dragoonings; of Marlborough going to the war. Four\r\n      generations have bloomed out, and loved and hated, and rustled\r\n      off: he was forty-six when Louis Fourteenth died. The Assembly,\r\n      as one man, spontaneously rose, and did reverence to the Eldest\r\n      of the World; old Jean is to take _séance_ among them,\r\n      honourably, with covered head. He gazes feebly there, with his\r\n      old eyes, on that new wonder-scene; dreamlike to him, and\r\n      uncertain, wavering amid fragments of old memories and dreams.\r\n      For Time is all growing unsubstantial, dreamlike; Jean’s eyes and\r\n      mind are weary, and about to close,—and open on a far other\r\n      wonder-scene, which shall be real. Patriot Subscription, Royal\r\n      Pension was got for him, and he returned home glad; but in two\r\n      months more he left it all, and went on his unknown way.[294]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.XI.\r\n      As in the Age of Gold.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile to Paris, ever going and returning, day after day, and\r\n      all day long, towards that Field of Mars, it becomes painfully\r\n      apparent that the spadework there cannot be got done in time.\r\n      There is such an area of it; three hundred thousand square feet:\r\n      for from the Ecole militaire (which will need to be done up in\r\n      wood with balconies and galleries) westward to the Gate by the\r\n      river (where also shall be wood, in triumphal arches), we count\r\n      same thousand yards of length; and for breadth, from this\r\n      umbrageous Avenue of eight rows, on the South side, to that\r\n      corresponding one on the North, some thousand feet, more or less.\r\n      All this to be scooped out, and wheeled up in slope along the\r\n      sides; high enough; for it must be rammed down there, and shaped\r\n      stair-wise into as many as “thirty ranges of convenient seats,”\r\n      firm-trimmed with turf, covered with enduring timber;—and then\r\n      our huge pyramidal Fatherland’s-Altar, _Autel de la Patrie_, in\r\n      the centre, also to be raised and stair-stepped! Force-work with\r\n      a vengeance; it is a World’s Amphitheatre! There are but fifteen\r\n      days good; and at this languid rate, it might take half as many\r\n      weeks. What is singular too, the spademen seem to work lazily;\r\n      they will not work double-tides, even for offer of more wages,\r\n      though their tide is but seven hours; they declare angrily that\r\n      the human tabernacle requires occasional rest!\r\n\r\n      Is it Aristocrats secretly bribing? Aristocrats were capable of\r\n      that. Only six months since, did not evidence get afloat that\r\n      subterranean Paris, for we stand over quarries and catacombs,\r\n      dangerously, as it were midway between Heaven and the Abyss, and\r\n      are hollow underground,—was charged with gunpowder, which should\r\n      make us “leap?” Till a Cordelier’s Deputation actually went to\r\n      examine, and found it—carried off again![295] An accursed,\r\n      incurable brood; all asking for “passports,” in these sacred\r\n      days. Trouble, of rioting, château-burning, is in the Limousin\r\n      and elsewhere; for they are busy! Between the best of Peoples and\r\n      the best of Restorer-Kings, they would sow grudges; with what a\r\n      fiend’s-grin would they see this Federation, looked for by the\r\n      Universe, fail!\r\n\r\n      Fail for want of spadework, however, it shall not. He that has\r\n      four limbs, and a French heart, can do spadework; and will! On\r\n      the first July Monday, scarcely has the signal-cannon boomed;\r\n      scarcely have the languescent mercenary Fifteen Thousand laid\r\n      down their tools, and the eyes of onlookers turned sorrowfully of\r\n      the still high Sun; when this and the other Patriot, fire in his\r\n      eye, snatches barrow and mattock, and himself begins indignantly\r\n      wheeling. Whom scores and then hundreds follow; and soon a\r\n      volunteer Fifteen Thousand are shovelling and trundling; with the\r\n      heart of giants; and all in right order, with that extemporaneous\r\n      adroitness of theirs: whereby _such_ a lift has been given, worth\r\n      three mercenary ones;—which may end when the late twilight\r\n      thickens, in triumph shouts, heard or heard of beyond Montmartre!\r\n\r\n      A sympathetic population will _wait_, next day, with eagerness,\r\n      till the tools are free. Or why wait? Spades elsewhere exist! And\r\n      so now bursts forth that effulgence of Parisian enthusiasm,\r\n      good-heartedness and brotherly love; such, if Chroniclers are\r\n      trustworthy, as was not witnessed since the Age of Gold. Paris,\r\n      male and female, precipitates itself towards its South-west\r\n      extremity, spade on shoulder. Streams of men, without order; or\r\n      in order, as ranked fellow-craftsmen, as natural or accidental\r\n      reunions, march towards the Field of Mars. Three-deep these\r\n      march; to the sound of stringed music; preceded by young girls\r\n      with green boughs, and tricolor streamers: they have shouldered,\r\n      soldier-wise, their shovels and picks; and with one throat are\r\n      singing _ça-ira_. Yes, _pardieu ça-ira_, cry the passengers on\r\n      the streets. All corporate Guilds, and public and private Bodies\r\n      of Citizens, from the highest to the lowest, march; the very\r\n      Hawkers, one finds, have ceased bawling for one day. The\r\n      neighbouring Villages turn out: their able men come marching, to\r\n      village fiddle or tambourine and triangle, under their Mayor, or\r\n      Mayor and Curate, who also walk bespaded, and in tricolor sash.\r\n      As many as one hundred and fifty thousand workers: nay at certain\r\n      seasons, as some count, two hundred and fifty thousand; for, in\r\n      the afternoon especially, what mortal but, finishing his hasty\r\n      day’s work, would run! A stirring city: from the time you reach\r\n      the Place Louis Quinze, southward over the River, by all Avenues,\r\n      it is one living throng. So many workers; and no mercenary\r\n      mock-workers, but real ones that lie freely to it: each Patriot\r\n      _stretches_ himself against the stubborn glebe; hews and wheels\r\n      with the whole weight that is in him.\r\n\r\n      Amiable infants, _aimables enfans!_ They do the “_police des\r\n      l’atelier_” too, the guidance and governance, themselves; with\r\n      that ready will of theirs, with that extemporaneous adroitness.\r\n      It is a true brethren’s work; all distinctions confounded,\r\n      abolished; as it was in the beginning, when Adam himself delved.\r\n      Longfrocked tonsured Monks, with short-skirted Water-carriers,\r\n      with swallow-tailed well-frizzled _Incroyables_ of a Patriot\r\n      turn; dark Charcoalmen, meal-white Peruke-makers; or\r\n      Peruke-wearers, for Advocate and Judge are there, and all Heads\r\n      of Districts: sober Nuns sisterlike with flaunting Nymphs of the\r\n      Opera, and females in common circumstances named unfortunate: the\r\n      patriot Rag-picker, and perfumed dweller in palaces; for\r\n      Patriotism like New-birth, and also like Death, levels all. The\r\n      Printers have come marching, Prudhomme’s all in Paper-caps with\r\n      _Révolutions de Paris_ printed on them; as Camille notes; wishing\r\n      that in these great days there should be a _Pacte des Ecrivains_\r\n      too, or Federation of Able Editors.[296] Beautiful to see! The\r\n      snowy linen and delicate pantaloon alternates with the soiled\r\n      check-shirt and bushel-breeches; for both have cast their coats,\r\n      and under both are four limbs and a set of Patriot muscles. There\r\n      do they pick and shovel; or bend forward, yoked in long strings\r\n      to box-barrow or overloaded tumbril; joyous, with one mind. Abbé\r\n      Sieyes is seen pulling, wiry, vehement, if too light for draught;\r\n      by the side of Beauharnais, who shall get Kings though he be\r\n      none. Abbé Maury did not pull; but the Charcoalmen brought a\r\n      mummer guised like him, so he had to pull in effigy. Let no\r\n      august Senator disdain the work: Mayor Bailly, Generalissimo\r\n      Lafayette are there;—and, alas, shall be there again another day!\r\n      The King himself comes to see: sky-rending _Vive-le-Roi;_ “and\r\n      suddenly with shouldered spades they form a guard of honour round\r\n      him.” Whosoever can come comes, to work, or to look, and bless\r\n      the work.\r\n\r\n      Whole families have come. One whole family we see clearly, of\r\n      three generations: the father picking, the mother shovelling, the\r\n      young ones wheeling assiduous; old grandfather, hoary with\r\n      ninety-three years, holds in his arms the youngest of all:[297]\r\n      frisky, not helpful this one; who nevertheless may tell it to\r\n      _his_ grandchildren; and how the Future and the Past alike looked\r\n      on, and with failing or with half-formed voice, faltered their\r\n      _ça-ira_. A vintner has wheeled in, on Patriot truck, beverage of\r\n      wine: ‘Drink not, my brothers, if ye are not dry; that your cask\r\n      may last the longer;’ neither did any drink, but men “evidently\r\n      exhausted.” A dapper Abbé looks on, sneering. ‘To the barrow!’\r\n      cry several; whom he, lest a worse thing befal him, obeys:\r\n      nevertheless one wiser Patriot barrowman, arriving now,\r\n      interposes his ‘_arrêtez;_’ setting down his own barrow, he\r\n      snatches the Abbé’s; trundles it fast, like an infected thing;\r\n      forth of the Champ-de-Mars circuit, and discharges it _there_.\r\n      Thus too a certain person (of some quality, or private capital,\r\n      to appearance), entering hastily, flings down his coat, waistcoat\r\n      and two watches, and is rushing to the thick of the work: ‘But\r\n      your watches?’ cries the general voice.—‘Does one distrust his\r\n      brothers?’ answers he; nor were the watches stolen. How beautiful\r\n      is noble-sentiment: like gossamer gauze, beautiful and cheap;\r\n      which will stand no tear and wear! Beautiful cheap gossamer\r\n      gauze, thou film-shadow of a raw-material of Virtue, which art\r\n      not woven, nor likely to be, into Duty; thou art better than\r\n      nothing, and also worse!\r\n\r\n      Young Boarding-school Boys, College Students, shout _Vive la\r\n      Nation_, and regret that they have yet “only their sweat to\r\n      give.” What say we of Boys? Beautifullest Hebes; the loveliest of\r\n      Paris, in their light air-robes, with riband-girdle of tricolor,\r\n      are there; shovelling and wheeling with the rest; their Hebe eyes\r\n      brighter with enthusiasm, and long hair in beautiful\r\n      dishevelment: hard-pressed are their small fingers; but they make\r\n      the patriot barrow go, and even force it to the summit of the\r\n      slope (with a little tracing, which what man’s arm were not too\r\n      happy to lend?)—then bound down with it again, and go for more;\r\n      with their long locks and tricolors blown back: graceful as the\r\n      rosy Hours. O, as that evening Sun fell over the Champ-de-Mars,\r\n      and tinted with fire the thick umbrageous boscage that shelters\r\n      it on this hand and on that, and struck direct on those Domes and\r\n      two-and-forty Windows of the Ecole Militaire, and made them all\r\n      of burnished gold,—saw he on his wide zodiac road other such\r\n      sight? A living garden spotted and dotted with such flowerage;\r\n      all colours of the prism; the beautifullest blent friendly with\r\n      the usefullest; all growing and working brotherlike there, under\r\n      one warm feeling, were it but for days; once and no second time!\r\n      But Night is sinking; these Nights too, into Eternity. The\r\n      hastiest Traveller Versailles-ward has drawn bridle on the\r\n      heights of Chaillot: and looked for moments over the River;\r\n      reporting at Versailles what he saw, not without tears.[298]\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, from all points of the compass, Federates are\r\n      arriving: fervid children of the South, “who glory in their\r\n      Mirabeau;” considerate North-blooded Mountaineers of Jura; sharp\r\n      Bretons, with their Gaelic suddenness; Normans not to be\r\n      overreached in bargain: all now animated with one noblest fire of\r\n      Patriotism. Whom the Paris brethren march forth to receive; with\r\n      military solemnities, with fraternal embracing, and a hospitality\r\n      worthy of the heroic ages. They assist at the Assembly’s Debates,\r\n      these Federates: the Galleries are reserved for them. They assist\r\n      in the toils of the Champ-de-Mars; each new troop will put its\r\n      hand to the spade; lift a hod of earth on the Altar of the\r\n      Fatherland. But the flourishes of rhetoric, for it is a\r\n      gesticulating People; the moral-sublime of those Addresses to an\r\n      august Assembly, to a Patriot Restorer! Our Breton Captain of\r\n      Federates kneels even, in a fit of enthusiasm, and gives up his\r\n      sword; he wet-eyed to a King wet-eyed. Poor Louis! These, as he\r\n      said afterwards, were among the bright days of his life.\r\n\r\n      Reviews also there must be; royal Federate-reviews, with King,\r\n      Queen and tricolor Court looking on: at lowest, if, as is too\r\n      common, it rains, our Federate Volunteers will file through the\r\n      inner gateways, Royalty standing dry. Nay there, should some stop\r\n      occur, the beautifullest fingers in France may take you softly by\r\n      the lapelle, and, in mild flute-voice, ask: ‘Monsieur, of what\r\n      Province are you?’ Happy he who can reply, chivalrously lowering\r\n      his sword’s point, ‘Madame, from the Province your ancestors\r\n      reigned over.’ He that happy “Provincial Advocate,” now\r\n      Provincial Federate, shall be rewarded by a sun-smile, and such\r\n      melodious glad words addressed to a King: ‘Sire, these are your\r\n      faithful Lorrainers.’ Cheerier verily, in these holidays, is this\r\n      “skyblue faced with red” of a National Guardsman, than the dull\r\n      black and gray of a Provincial Advocate, which in workdays one\r\n      was used to. For the same thrice-blessed Lorrainer shall, this\r\n      evening, stand sentry at a Queen’s door; and feel that he could\r\n      die a thousand deaths for her: then again, at the outer gate, and\r\n      even a third time, she shall see him; nay he will make her do it;\r\n      presenting arms with emphasis, “making his musket jingle again”:\r\n      and in her salute there shall again be a sun-smile, and that\r\n      little blonde-locked too hasty Dauphin shall be admonished,\r\n      ‘Salute then, Monsieur, don’t be unpolite;’ and therewith she,\r\n      like a bright Sky-wanderer or Planet with her little Moon, issues\r\n      forth peculiar.[299]\r\n\r\n      But at night, when Patriot spadework is over, figure the sacred\r\n      rights of hospitality! Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau, a mere private\r\n      senator, but with great possessions, has daily his “hundred\r\n      dinner-guests;” the table of Generalissimo Lafayette may double\r\n      that number. In lowly parlour, as in lofty saloon, the wine-cup\r\n      passes round; crowned by the smiles of Beauty; be it of\r\n      lightly-tripping Grisette, or of high-sailing Dame, for both\r\n      equally have beauty, and smiles precious to the brave.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.1.XII.\r\n      Sound and Smoke.\r\n\r\n      And so now, in spite of plotting Aristocrats, lazy hired\r\n      spademen, and almost of Destiny itself (for there has been much\r\n      rain), the Champ-de-Mars, on the 13th of the month is fairly\r\n      ready; trimmed, rammed, buttressed with firm masonry; and\r\n      Patriotism can stroll over it admiring; and as it were\r\n      rehearsing, for in every head is some unutterable image of the\r\n      morrow. Pray Heaven there be not clouds. Nay what far worse cloud\r\n      is this, of a misguided Municipality that talks of admitting\r\n      Patriotism, to the solemnity, by tickets! Was it by tickets we\r\n      were admitted to the work; and to what brought the work? Did we\r\n      take the Bastille by tickets? A misguided Municipality sees the\r\n      error; at late midnight, rolling drums announce to Patriotism\r\n      starting half out of its bed-clothes, that it is to be\r\n      ticketless. Pull down thy night-cap therefore; and, with\r\n      demi-articulate grumble, significant of several things, go\r\n      pacified to sleep again. Tomorrow is Wednesday morning;\r\n      unforgetable among the _fasti_ of the world.\r\n\r\n      The morning comes, cold for a July one; but such a festivity\r\n      would make Greenland smile. Through every inlet of that National\r\n      Amphitheatre (for it is a league in circuit, cut with openings at\r\n      due intervals), floods-in the living throng; covers without\r\n      tumult space after space. The Ecole Militaire has galleries and\r\n      overvaulting canopies, where Carpentry and Painting have vied,\r\n      for the upper Authorities; triumphal arches, at the Gate by the\r\n      River, bear inscriptions, if weak, yet well-meant, and orthodox.\r\n      Far aloft, over the Altar of the Fatherland, on their tall crane\r\n      standards of iron, swing pensile our antique _Cassolettes_ or\r\n      pans of incense; dispensing sweet incense-fumes,—unless for the\r\n      Heathen Mythology, one sees not for whom. Two hundred thousand\r\n      Patriotic Men; and, twice as good, one hundred thousand Patriotic\r\n      Women, all decked and glorified as one can fancy, sit waiting in\r\n      this Champ-de-Mars.\r\n\r\n      What a picture: that circle of bright-eyed Life, spread up there,\r\n      on its thirty-seated Slope; leaning, one would say, on the thick\r\n      umbrage of those Avenue-Trees, for the stems of them are hidden\r\n      by the height; and all beyond it mere greenness of Summer Earth,\r\n      with the gleams of waters, or white sparklings of stone-edifices:\r\n      little circular enamel-picture in the centre of such a vase—of\r\n      emerald! A vase not empty: the Invalides Cupolas want not their\r\n      population, nor the distant Windmills of Montmartre; on remotest\r\n      steeple and invisible village belfry, stand men with spy-glasses.\r\n      On the heights of Chaillot are many-coloured undulating groups;\r\n      round and far on, over all the circling heights that embosom\r\n      Paris, it is as one more or less peopled Amphitheatre; which the\r\n      eye grows dim with measuring. Nay heights, as was before hinted,\r\n      have cannon; and a floating-battery of cannon is on the Seine.\r\n      When eye fails, ear shall serve; and all France properly is but\r\n      one Amphitheatre: for in paved town and unpaved hamlet, men walk\r\n      listening; till the muffled thunder sound audible on their\r\n      horizon, that they too may begin swearing and firing![300] But\r\n      now, to streams of music, come Federates enough,—for they have\r\n      assembled on the Boulevard Saint-Antoine or thereby, and come\r\n      marching through the City, with their Eighty-three Department\r\n      Banners, and blessings not loud but deep; comes National\r\n      Assembly, and takes seat under its Canopy; comes Royalty, and\r\n      takes seat on a throne beside it. And Lafayette, on white\r\n      charger, is here, and all the civic Functionaries; and the\r\n      Federates form dances, till their strictly military evolutions\r\n      and manœuvres can begin.\r\n\r\n      Evolutions and manœuvres? Task not the pen of mortal to describe\r\n      them: truant imagination droops;—declares that it is not worth\r\n      while. There is wheeling and sweeping, to slow, to quick, and\r\n      double quick-time: Sieur Motier, or Generalissimo Lafayette, for\r\n      they are one and the same, and he is General of France, in the\r\n      King’s stead, for four-and-twenty hours; Sieur Motier must step\r\n      forth, with that sublime chivalrous gait of his; solemnly ascend\r\n      the steps of the Fatherland’s Altar, in sight of Heaven and of\r\n      the scarcely breathing Earth; and, under the creak of those\r\n      swinging _Cassolettes_, “pressing his sword’s point firmly\r\n      there,” pronounce the Oath, _To King, to Law, and Nation_ (not to\r\n      mention “grains” with their circulating), in his own name and\r\n      that of armed France. Whereat there is waving of banners and\r\n      acclaim sufficient. The National Assembly must swear, standing in\r\n      its place; the King himself audibly. The King swears; and now\r\n      _be_ the welkin split with vivats; let citizens enfranchised\r\n      embrace, each smiting heartily his palm into his fellow’s; and\r\n      armed Federates clang their arms; above all, that floating\r\n      battery speak! It has spoken,—to the four corners of France. From\r\n      eminence to eminence, bursts the thunder; faint-heard,\r\n      loud-repeated. What a stone, cast into what a lake; in circles\r\n      that do _not_ grow fainter. From Arras to Avignon; from Metz to\r\n      Bayonne! Over Orléans and Blois it rolls, in cannon-recitative;\r\n      Puy bellows of it amid his granite mountains; Pau where is the\r\n      shell-cradle of Great Henri. At far Marseilles, one can think,\r\n      the ruddy evening witnesses it; over the deep-blue Mediterranean\r\n      waters, the Castle of If ruddy-tinted darts forth, from every\r\n      cannon’s mouth, its tongue of fire; and all the people shout:\r\n      Yes, France is free. O glorious France that has burst out so;\r\n      into universal sound and smoke; and attained—the Phrygian _Cap_\r\n      of Liberty! In all Towns, Trees of Liberty also may be planted;\r\n      with or without advantage. Said we not, it is the highest stretch\r\n      attained by the Thespian Art on this Planet, or perhaps\r\n      attainable?\r\n\r\n      The Thespian Art, unfortunately, one must still call it; for\r\n      behold there, on this Field of Mars, the National Banners, before\r\n      there could be any swearing, were to be all blessed. A most\r\n      proper operation; since surely without Heaven’s blessing\r\n      bestowed, say even, audibly or inaudibly _sought_, no Earthly\r\n      banner or contrivance can prove victorious: but now the means of\r\n      doing it? By what thrice-divine Franklin thunder-rod shall\r\n      miraculous fire be drawn out of Heaven; and descend gently,\r\n      life-giving, with health to the souls of men? Alas, by the\r\n      simplest: by Two Hundred shaven-crowned Individuals, “in\r\n      snow-white albs, with tricolor girdles,” arranged on the steps of\r\n      Fatherland’s Altar; and, at their head for spokesman, Soul’s\r\n      Overseer Talleyrand-Perigord! These shall act as miraculous\r\n      thunder-rod,—to such length as they can. O ye deep azure Heavens,\r\n      and thou green all-nursing Earth; ye Streams ever-flowing;\r\n      deciduous Forests that die and are born again, continually, like\r\n      the sons of men; stone Mountains that die daily with every\r\n      rain-shower, yet are not dead and levelled for ages of ages, nor\r\n      born again (it seems) but with new world-explosions, and such\r\n      tumultuous seething and tumbling, steam half way to the Moon; O\r\n      thou unfathomable mystic All, garment and dwellingplace of the\r\n      UNNAMED; O spirit, lastly, of Man, who mouldest and modellest\r\n      that Unfathomable Unnameable even as we see,—is not _there_ a\r\n      miracle: That some French mortal should, we say not have\r\n      believed, but pretended to imagine that he believed that\r\n      Talleyrand and Two Hundred pieces of white Calico could do it!\r\n\r\n      Here, however, we are to remark with the sorrowing Historians of\r\n      that day, that suddenly, while Episcopus Talleyrand, long-stoled,\r\n      with mitre and tricolor belt, was yet but hitching up the\r\n      Altar-steps, to do his miracle, the material Heaven grew black; a\r\n      north-wind, moaning cold moisture, began to sing; and there\r\n      descended a very deluge of rain. Sad to see! The thirty-staired\r\n      Seats, all round our Amphitheatre, get instantaneously slated\r\n      with mere umbrellas, fallacious when so thick set: our antique\r\n      _Cassolettes_ become Water-pots; their incense-smoke gone\r\n      hissing, in a whiff of muddy vapour. Alas, instead of vivats,\r\n      there is nothing now but the furious peppering and rattling. From\r\n      three to four hundred thousand human individuals feel that they\r\n      have a skin; happily _im_pervious. The General’s sash runs water:\r\n      how all military banners droop; and will not wave, but lazily\r\n      flap, as if metamorphosed into painted tin-banners! Worse, far\r\n      worse, these hundred thousand, such is the Historian’s testimony,\r\n      of the fairest of France! Their snowy muslins all splashed and\r\n      draggled; the ostrich feather shrunk shamefully to the backbone\r\n      of a feather: all caps are ruined; innermost pasteboard molten\r\n      into its original pap: Beauty no longer swims decorated in her\r\n      garniture, like Love-goddess hidden-revealed in her Paphian\r\n      clouds, but struggles in disastrous imprisonment in it, for “the\r\n      shape was noticeable;” and now only sympathetic interjections,\r\n      titterings, teeheeings, and resolute good-humour will avail. A\r\n      deluge; an incessant sheet or fluid-column of rain;—such that our\r\n      Overseer’s very mitre must be filled; not a mitre, but a filled\r\n      and leaky fire-bucket on his reverend head!—Regardless of which,\r\n      Overseer Talleyrand performs his miracle: the Blessing of\r\n      Talleyrand, another than that of Jacob, is on all the\r\n      Eighty-three departmental flags of France; which wave or flap,\r\n      with such thankfulness as needs. Towards three o’clock, the sun\r\n      beams out again: the remaining evolutions can be transacted under\r\n      bright heavens, though with decorations much damaged.[301]\r\n\r\n      On Wednesday our Federation is consummated: but the festivities\r\n      last out the week, and over into the next. Festivities such as no\r\n      Bagdad Caliph, or Aladdin with the Lamp, could have equalled.\r\n      There is a Jousting on the River; with its water-somersets,\r\n      splashing and haha-ing: Abbé Fauchet, _Te-Deum_ Fauchet,\r\n      preaches, for his part, in “the rotunda of the Corn-market,” a\r\n      Harangue on Franklin; for whom the National Assembly has lately\r\n      gone three days in black. The Motier and Lepelletier tables still\r\n      groan with viands; roofs ringing with patriotic toasts. On the\r\n      fifth evening, which is the Christian Sabbath, there is a\r\n      universal Ball. Paris, out of doors and in, man, woman and child,\r\n      is jigging it, to the sound of harp and four-stringed fiddle. The\r\n      hoariest-headed man will tread one other measure, under this\r\n      nether Moon; speechless nurselings, _infants_ as we call them,\r\n      νήπια τέκνα, crow in arms; and sprawl out numb-plump little\r\n      limbs,—impatient for muscularity, they know not why. The stiffest\r\n      balk bends more or less; all joists creak.\r\n\r\n      Or out, on the Earth’s breast itself, behold the Ruins of the\r\n      Bastille. All lamplit, allegorically decorated: a Tree of Liberty\r\n      sixty feet high; and Phrygian Cap on it, of size enormous, under\r\n      which King Arthur and his round-table might have dined! In the\r\n      depths of the background, is a single lugubrious lamp, rendering\r\n      dim-visible one of your iron cages, half-buried, and some Prison\r\n      stones,—Tyranny vanishing downwards, all gone but the skirt: the\r\n      rest wholly lamp-festoons, trees real or of pasteboard; in the\r\n      similitude of a fairy grove; with this inscription, readable to\r\n      runner: “_Ici l’on danse_, Dancing Here.” As indeed had been\r\n      obscurely foreshadowed by Cagliostro[302] prophetic Quack of\r\n      Quacks, when he, four years ago, quitted the grim durance;—to\r\n      fall into a grimmer, of the Roman Inquisition, and not quit it.\r\n\r\n      But, after all, what is this Bastille business to that of the\r\n      _Champs Elysées!_ Thither, to these Fields well named Elysian,\r\n      all feet tend. It is radiant as day with festooned lamps; little\r\n      oil-cups, like variegated fire-flies, daintily illumine the\r\n      highest leaves: trees there are all sheeted with variegated fire,\r\n      shedding far a glimmer into the dubious wood. There, under the\r\n      free sky, do tight-limbed Federates, with fairest newfound\r\n      sweethearts, elastic as Diana, and not of that coyness and tart\r\n      humour of Diana, thread their jocund mazes, all through the\r\n      ambrosial night; and hearts were touched and fired; and seldom\r\n      surely had our old Planet, in that huge conic Shadow of hers\r\n      “which goes beyond the Moon, and is named _Night_,” curtained\r\n      such a Ball-room. O if, according to Seneca, the very gods look\r\n      down on a good man struggling with adversity, and smile; what\r\n      must they think of Five-and-twenty million indifferent ones\r\n      victorious over it,—for eight days and more?\r\n\r\n      In this way, and in such ways, however, has the Feast of Pikes\r\n      danced itself off; gallant Federates wending homewards, towards\r\n      every point of the compass, with feverish nerves, heart and head\r\n      much heated; some of them, indeed, as Dampmartin’s elderly\r\n      respectable friend, from Strasbourg, quite “burnt out with\r\n      liquors,” and flickering towards extinction.[303] The Feast of\r\n      Pikes has danced itself off, and become defunct, and the ghost of\r\n      a Feast;—nothing of it now remaining but this vision in men’s\r\n      memory; and the place that knew it (for the slope of that\r\n      Champ-de-Mars is crumbled to half the original height[304]) now\r\n      knowing it no more. Undoubtedly one of the memorablest National\r\n      Hightides. Never or hardly ever, as we said, was Oath sworn with\r\n      such heart-effusion, emphasis and expenditure of joyance; and\r\n      then it was broken irremediably within year and day. Ah, why?\r\n      When the swearing of it was so heavenly-joyful, bosom clasped to\r\n      bosom, and Five-and-twenty million hearts all burning together: O\r\n      ye inexorable Destinies, why?—Partly _because_ it was sworn with\r\n      such over-joyance; but chiefly, indeed, for an older reason: that\r\n      Sin had come into the world and Misery by Sin! These\r\n      Five-and-twenty millions, if we will consider it, have now\r\n      henceforth, with that Phrygian Cap of theirs, no force _over_\r\n      them, to bind and guide; neither in them, more than heretofore,\r\n      is guiding force, or rule of just living: how then, while they\r\n      all go rushing at such a _pace_, on unknown ways, with no bridle,\r\n      towards no aim, can hurlyburly unutterable fail? For verily not\r\n      Federation-rosepink is the colour of this Earth and her work: not\r\n      by outbursts of noble-sentiment, but with far other ammunition,\r\n      shall a man front the world.\r\n\r\n      But how wise, in all cases, to “husband your fire;” to keep it\r\n      deep down, rather, as genial radical-heat! Explosions, the\r\n      forciblest, and never so well directed, are questionable; far\r\n      oftenest futile, always frightfully wasteful: but think of a man,\r\n      of a Nation of men, spending its whole stock of fire in one\r\n      artificial Firework! So have we seen fond weddings (for\r\n      individuals, like Nations, have their Hightides) celebrated with\r\n      an outburst of triumph and deray, at which the elderly shook\r\n      their heads. Better had a serious cheerfulness been; for the\r\n      enterprise was great. Fond pair! the more triumphant ye feel, and\r\n      victorious over terrestrial evil, which seems all abolished, the\r\n      wider-eyed will your disappointment be to find terrestrial evil\r\n      still extant. ‘And why extant?’ will each of you cry: ‘Because my\r\n      false mate has played the traitor: evil was abolished; I meant\r\n      faithfully, and did, or would have done.’ Whereby the oversweet\r\n      moon of honey changes itself into long years of vinegar; perhaps\r\n      divulsive vinegar, like Hannibal’s.\r\n\r\n      Shall we say then, the French Nation has led Royalty, or wooed\r\n      and teased poor Royalty to lead _her_, to the hymeneal\r\n      Fatherland’s Altar, in such oversweet manner; and has, most\r\n      thoughtlessly, to celebrate the nuptials with due shine and\r\n      demonstration,—burnt her bed?\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 2.II.\r\n      NANCI\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.2.I.\r\n      Bouillé.\r\n\r\n      Dimly visible, at Metz on the North-Eastern frontier, a certain\r\n      brave Bouillé, last refuge of Royalty in all straits and\r\n      meditations of flight, has for many months hovered occasionally\r\n      in our eye; some name or shadow of a brave Bouillé: let us now,\r\n      for a little, look fixedly at him, till he become a substance and\r\n      person for us. The man himself is worth a glance; his position\r\n      and procedure there, in these days, will throw light on many\r\n      things.\r\n\r\n      For it is with Bouillé as with all French Commanding Officers;\r\n      only in a more emphatic degree. The grand National Federation, we\r\n      already guess, was but empty sound, or worse: a last loudest\r\n      universal _Hep-hep-hurrah_, with full bumpers, in that National\r\n      Lapithae-feast of Constitution-making; as in loud denial of the\r\n      palpably existing; as if, with hurrahings, you would shut out\r\n      notice of the inevitable already knocking at the gates! Which new\r\n      National bumper, one may say, can but deepen the drunkenness; and\r\n      so, the _louder_ it swears Brotherhood, will the sooner and the\r\n      more surely lead to Cannibalism. Ah, under that fraternal shine\r\n      and clangour, what a deep world of irreconcileable discords lie\r\n      momentarily assuaged, damped down for one moment! Respectable\r\n      military Federates have barely got home to their quarters; and\r\n      the inflammablest, “dying, burnt up with liquors, and kindness,”\r\n      has not yet got extinct; the shine is hardly out of men’s eyes,\r\n      and still blazes filling all men’s memories,—when your discords\r\n      burst forth again very considerably darker than ever. Let us look\r\n      at Bouillé, and see how.\r\n\r\n      Bouillé for the present commands in the Garrison of Metz, and far\r\n      and wide over the East and North; being indeed, by a late act of\r\n      Government with sanction of National Assembly, appointed one of\r\n      our Four supreme Generals. Rochambeau and Mailly, men and\r\n      Marshals of note in these days, though to us of small moment, are\r\n      two of his colleagues; tough old babbling Lückner, also of small\r\n      moment for us, will probably be the third. Marquis de Bouillé is\r\n      a determined Loyalist; not indeed disinclined to moderate reform,\r\n      but resolute against immoderate. A man long suspect to\r\n      Patriotism; who has more than once given the august Assembly\r\n      trouble; who would not, for example, take the National Oath, as\r\n      he was bound to do, but always put it off on this or the other\r\n      pretext, till an autograph of Majesty requested him to do it as a\r\n      favour. There, in this post if not of honour, yet of eminence and\r\n      danger, he waits, in a silent concentered manner; very dubious of\r\n      the future. “Alone,” as he says, or almost alone, of all the old\r\n      military Notabilities, he has not emigrated; but thinks always,\r\n      in atrabiliar moments, that there will be nothing for him too but\r\n      to cross the marches. He might cross, say, to Treves or Coblentz\r\n      where Exiled Princes will be one day ranking; or say, over into\r\n      Luxemburg where old Broglie loiters and languishes. Or is there\r\n      not the great dim Deep of European Diplomacy; where your\r\n      Calonnes, your Bréteuils are beginning to hover, dimly\r\n      discernible?\r\n\r\n      With immeasurable confused outlooks and purposes, with no clear\r\n      purpose but this of still trying to do His Majesty a service,\r\n      Bouillé waits; struggling what he can to keep his district loyal,\r\n      his troops faithful, his garrisons furnished. He maintains, as\r\n      yet, with his Cousin Lafayette, some thin diplomatic\r\n      correspondence, by letter and messenger; chivalrous\r\n      constitutional professions on the one side, military gravity and\r\n      brevity on the other; which thin correspondence one can see\r\n      growing ever the thinner and hollower, towards the verge of\r\n      entire vacuity.[305] A quick, choleric, sharply discerning,\r\n      stubbornly endeavouring man; with suppressed-explosive\r\n      resolution, with valour, nay headlong audacity: a man who was\r\n      more in his place, lionlike defending those Windward Isles, or,\r\n      as with military tiger-spring, clutching Nevis and Montserrat\r\n      from the English,—than here in this suppressed condition, muzzled\r\n      and fettered by diplomatic packthreads; looking out for a civil\r\n      war, which may never arrive. Few years ago Bouillé was to have\r\n      led a French East-Indian Expedition, and reconquered or conquered\r\n      Pondicherri and the Kingdoms of the Sun: but the whole world is\r\n      suddenly changed, and he with it; Destiny willed it not in that\r\n      way but in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.2.II.\r\n      Arrears and Aristocrats.\r\n\r\n      Indeed, as to the general outlook of things, Bouillé himself\r\n      augurs not well of it. The French Army, ever since those old\r\n      Bastille days, and earlier, has been universally in the\r\n      questionablest state, and growing daily worse. Discipline, which\r\n      is at all times a kind of miracle, and works by faith, broke down\r\n      then; one sees not with that near prospect of recovering itself.\r\n      The Gardes Françaises played a deadly game; but how they won it,\r\n      and wear the prizes of it, all men know. In that general\r\n      overturn, we saw the Hired Fighters refuse to fight. The very\r\n      Swiss of Château-Vieux, which indeed is a kind of French Swiss,\r\n      from Geneva and the Pays de Vaud, are understood to have\r\n      declined. Deserters glided over; Royal-Allemand itself looked\r\n      disconsolate, though stanch of purpose. In a word, we there saw\r\n      _Military Rule_, in the shape of poor Besenval with that\r\n      convulsive unmanageable Camp of his, pass two martyr days on the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars; and then, veiling itself, so to speak, “under the\r\n      cloud of night,” depart “down the left bank of the Seine,” to\r\n      seek refuge elsewhere; _this_ ground having clearly become too\r\n      hot for it.\r\n\r\n      But what new ground to seek, what remedy to try? Quarters that\r\n      were “uninfected:” this doubtless, with judicious strictness of\r\n      drilling, were the plan. Alas, in all quarters and places, from\r\n      Paris onward to the remotest hamlet, is infection, is seditious\r\n      contagion: inhaled, propagated by contact and converse, till the\r\n      dullest soldier catch it! There is speech of men in uniform with\r\n      men not in uniform; men in uniform read journals, and even write\r\n      in them.[306] There are public petitions or remonstrances,\r\n      private emissaries and associations; there is discontent,\r\n      jealousy, uncertainty, sullen suspicious humour. The whole French\r\n      Army, fermenting in dark heat, glooms ominous, boding good to no\r\n      one.\r\n\r\n      So that, in the general social dissolution and revolt, we are to\r\n      have this deepest and dismallest kind of it, a revolting\r\n      soldiery? Barren, desolate to look upon is this same business of\r\n      revolt under all its aspects; but how infinitely more so, when it\r\n      takes the aspect of military mutiny! The very implement of rule\r\n      and restraint, whereby all the rest was managed and held in\r\n      order, has become precisely the frightfullest immeasurable\r\n      implement of misrule; like the element of Fire, our indispensable\r\n      all-ministering servant, when it gets the _mastery_, and becomes\r\n      conflagration. Discipline we called a kind of miracle: in fact,\r\n      is it not miraculous how one man moves hundreds of thousands;\r\n      each unit of whom it may be loves him not, and singly fears him\r\n      not, yet has to obey him, to go hither or go thither, to march\r\n      and halt, to give death, and even to receive it, as if a Fate had\r\n      spoken; and the word-of-command becomes, almost in the literal\r\n      sense, a magic-word?\r\n\r\n      Which magic-word, again, if it be once _forgotten;_ the spell of\r\n      it once broken! The legions of assiduous ministering spirits rise\r\n      on you now as menacing fiends; your free orderly arena becomes a\r\n      tumult-place of the Nether Pit, and the hapless magician is rent\r\n      limb from limb. Military mobs are mobs with muskets in their\r\n      hands; and also with death hanging over their heads, for death is\r\n      the penalty of disobedience and they have disobeyed. And now if\r\n      all mobs are properly frenzies, and work frenetically with mad\r\n      fits of hot and of cold, fierce rage alternating so incoherently\r\n      with panic terror, consider what your military mob will be, with\r\n      such a conflict of duties and penalties, whirled between remorse\r\n      and fury, and, for the hot fit, loaded fire-arms in its hand! To\r\n      the soldier himself, revolt is frightful, and oftenest perhaps\r\n      pitiable; and yet so dangerous, it can only be hated, cannot be\r\n      pitied. An anomalous class of mortals these poor Hired Killers!\r\n      With a frankness, which to the Moralist in these times seems\r\n      surprising, they have sworn to become machines; and nevertheless\r\n      they are still partly men. Let no prudent person in authority\r\n      remind them of this latter fact; but always let force, let\r\n      injustice above all, stop short clearly on _this_ side of the\r\n      rebounding-point! Soldiers, as we often say, do revolt: were it\r\n      not so, several things which are transient in this world might be\r\n      perennial.\r\n\r\n      Over and above the general quarrel which all sons of Adam\r\n      maintain with their lot here below, the grievances of the French\r\n      soldiery reduce themselves to two, First that their Officers are\r\n      Aristocrats; secondly that they cheat them of their Pay. Two\r\n      grievances; or rather we might say one, capable of becoming a\r\n      hundred; for in that single first proposition, that the Officers\r\n      are Aristocrats, what a multitude of corollaries lie ready! It is\r\n      a bottomless ever-flowing fountain of grievances this; what you\r\n      may call a general raw-material of grievance, wherefrom\r\n      individual grievance after grievance will daily body itself\r\n      forth. Nay there will even be a kind of comfort in getting it,\r\n      from time to time, so embodied. Peculation of one’s Pay! It is\r\n      embodied; made tangible, made denounceable; exhalable, if only in\r\n      angry words.\r\n\r\n      For unluckily that grand fountain of grievances does exist:\r\n      Aristocrats almost all our Officers necessarily are; they have it\r\n      in the blood and bone. By the law of the case, no man can pretend\r\n      to be the pitifullest lieutenant of militia, till he have first\r\n      verified, to the satisfaction of the Lion-King, a Nobility of\r\n      four generations. Not Nobility only, but four generations of it:\r\n      this latter is the improvement hit upon, in comparatively late\r\n      years, by a certain War-minister much pressed for\r\n      commissions.[307] An improvement which did relieve the\r\n      over-pressed War-minister, but which split France still further\r\n      into yawning contrasts of Commonalty and Nobility, nay of new\r\n      Nobility and old; as if already with your new and old, and then\r\n      with your old, older and oldest, there were not contrasts and\r\n      discrepancies enough;—the general clash whereof men now see and\r\n      hear, and in the singular whirlpool, all contrasts gone together\r\n      to the bottom! Gone to the bottom or going; with uproar, without\r\n      return; going every where save in the Military section of things;\r\n      and there, it may be asked, can they hope to continue always at\r\n      the top? Apparently, not.\r\n\r\n      It is true, in a time of external Peace, when there is no\r\n      fighting but only drilling, this question, How you rise from the\r\n      ranks, may seem theoretical rather. But in reference to the\r\n      Rights of Man it is continually practical. The soldier has sworn\r\n      to be faithful not to the King only, but to the Law and the\r\n      Nation. Do our commanders love the Revolution? ask all soldiers.\r\n      Unhappily no, they hate it, and love the Counter-Revolution.\r\n      Young epauletted men, with quality-blood in them, poisoned with\r\n      quality-pride, do sniff openly, with indignation struggling to\r\n      become contempt, at our Rights of Man, as at some newfangled\r\n      cobweb, which shall be brushed down again. Old officers, more\r\n      cautious, keep silent, with closed uncurled lips; but one guesses\r\n      what is passing within. Nay who knows, how, under the plausiblest\r\n      word of command, might lie Counter-Revolution itself, sale to\r\n      Exiled Princes and the Austrian Kaiser: treacherous Aristocrats\r\n      hoodwinking the small insight of us common men?—In such manner\r\n      works that general raw-material of grievance; disastrous; instead\r\n      of trust and reverence, breeding hate, endless suspicion, the\r\n      impossibility of commanding and obeying. And now when this second\r\n      more tangible grievance has articulated itself universally in the\r\n      mind of the common man: Peculation of his Pay! Peculation of the\r\n      despicablest sort does exist, and has long existed; but, unless\r\n      the new-declared Rights of Man, and all rights whatsoever, be a\r\n      cobweb, it shall no longer exist.\r\n\r\n      The French Military System seems dying a sorrowful suicidal\r\n      death. Nay more, citizen, as is natural, ranks himself against\r\n      citizen in this cause. The soldier finds audience, of numbers and\r\n      sympathy unlimited, among the Patriot lower-classes. Nor are the\r\n      higher wanting to the officer. The officer still dresses and\r\n      perfumes himself for such sad unemigrated _soirée_ as there may\r\n      still be; and speaks his woes,—which woes, are they not Majesty’s\r\n      and Nature’s? Speaks, at the same time, his gay defiance, his\r\n      firm-set resolution. Citizens, still more Citizenesses, see the\r\n      right and the wrong; not the Military System alone will die by\r\n      suicide, but much along with it. As was said, there is yet\r\n      possible a deepest overturn than any yet witnessed: that deepest\r\n      _up_turn of the black-burning sulphurous stratum whereon all\r\n      rests and grows!\r\n\r\n      But how these things may act on the rude soldier-mind, with its\r\n      military pedantries, its inexperience of all that lies off the\r\n      parade-ground; inexperience as of a child, yet fierceness of a\r\n      man and vehemence of a Frenchman! It is long that secret\r\n      communings in mess-room and guard-room, sour looks, thousandfold\r\n      petty vexations between commander and commanded, measure every\r\n      where the weary military day. Ask Captain Dampmartin; an\r\n      authentic, ingenious literary officer of horse; who loves the\r\n      Reign of Liberty, after a sort; yet has had his heart grieved to\r\n      the quick many times, in the hot South-Western region and\r\n      elsewhere; and has seen riot, civil battle by daylight and by\r\n      torchlight, and anarchy hatefuller than death. How insubordinate\r\n      Troopers, with drink in their heads, meet Captain Dampmartin and\r\n      another on the ramparts, where there is no escape or side-path;\r\n      and make military salute punctually, for we look calm on them;\r\n      yet make it in a snappish, almost insulting manner: how one\r\n      morning they “leave all their chamois shirts” and superfluous\r\n      buffs, which they are tired of, laid in piles at the Captain’s\r\n      doors; whereat “we laugh,” as the ass does, eating thistles: nay\r\n      how they “knot two forage-cords together,” with universal noisy\r\n      cursing, with evident intent to hang the Quarter-master:—all this\r\n      the worthy Captain, looking on it through the ruddy-and-sable of\r\n      fond regretful memory, has flowingly written down.[308] Men growl\r\n      in vague discontent; officers fling up their commissions, and\r\n      emigrate in disgust.\r\n\r\n      Or let us ask another literary Officer; not yet Captain;\r\n      Sublieutenant only, in the Artillery Regiment La Fère: a young\r\n      man of twenty-one; not unentitled to speak; the name of him is\r\n      _Napoleon Buonaparte._ To such height of Sublieutenancy has he\r\n      now got promoted, from Brienne School, five years ago; “being\r\n      found qualified in mathematics by La Place.” He is lying at\r\n      Auxonne, in the West, in these months; not sumptuously lodged—“in\r\n      the house of a Barber, to whose wife he did not pay the customary\r\n      degree of respect;” or even over at the Pavilion, in a chamber\r\n      with bare walls; the only furniture an indifferent “bed without\r\n      curtains, two chairs, and in the recess of a window a table\r\n      covered with books and papers: his Brother Louis sleeps on a\r\n      coarse mattrass in an adjoining room.” However, he is doing\r\n      something great: writing his first Book or Pamphlet,—eloquent\r\n      vehement _Letter to M. Matteo Buttafuoco_, our Corsican Deputy,\r\n      who is not a Patriot but an Aristocrat, unworthy of Deputyship.\r\n      Joly of Dôle is Publisher. The literary Sublieutenant corrects\r\n      the proofs; “sets out on foot from Auxonne, every morning at four\r\n      o’clock, for Dôle: after looking over the proofs, he partakes of\r\n      an extremely frugal breakfast with Joly, and immediately prepares\r\n      for returning to his Garrison; where he arrives before noon,\r\n      having thus walked above twenty miles in the course of the\r\n      morning.”\r\n\r\n      This Sublieutenant can remark that, in drawing-rooms, on streets,\r\n      on highways, at inns, every where men’s minds are ready to kindle\r\n      into a flame. That a Patriot, if he appear in the drawing-room,\r\n      or amid a group of officers, is liable enough to be discouraged,\r\n      so great is the majority against him: but no sooner does he get\r\n      into the street, or among the soldiers, than he feels again as if\r\n      the whole Nation were with him. That after the famous Oath, _To\r\n      the King, to the Nation and Law_, there was a great change; that\r\n      before this, if ordered to fire on the people, he for one would\r\n      have done it in the King’s name; but that after this, in the\r\n      Nation’s name, he would not have done it. Likewise that the\r\n      Patriot officers, more numerous too in the Artillery and\r\n      Engineers than elsewhere, were few in number; yet that having the\r\n      soldiers on their side, they ruled the regiment; and did often\r\n      deliver the Aristocrat brother officer out of peril and strait.\r\n      One day, for example, “a member of our own mess roused the mob,\r\n      by singing, from the windows of our dining-room, _O Richard, O my\r\n      King;_ and I had to snatch him from their fury.”[309]\r\n\r\n      All which let the reader multiply by ten thousand; and spread it\r\n      with slight variations over all the camps and garrisons of\r\n      France. The French Army seems on the verge of universal mutiny.\r\n\r\n      Universal mutiny! There is in that what may well make Patriot\r\n      Constitutionalism and an august Assembly shudder. Something\r\n      behoves to be done; yet what to do no man can tell. Mirabeau\r\n      proposes even that the Soldiery, having come to such a pass, be\r\n      forthwith disbanded, the whole Two Hundred and Eighty Thousands\r\n      of them; and organised anew.[310] Impossible this, in so sudden a\r\n      manner! cry all men. And yet literally, answer we, it is\r\n      inevitable, in one manner or another. Such an Army, with its\r\n      four-generation Nobles, its Peculated Pay, and men knotting\r\n      forage cords to hang their quartermaster, cannot subsist beside\r\n      such a Revolution. Your alternative is a slow-pining chronic\r\n      dissolution and new organization; or a swift decisive one; the\r\n      agonies spread over years, or concentrated into an hour. With a\r\n      Mirabeau for Minister or Governor the latter had been the choice;\r\n      with no Mirabeau for Governor it will naturally be the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.2.III.\r\n      Bouillé at Metz.\r\n\r\n      To Bouillé, in his North-Eastern circle, none of these things are\r\n      altogether hid. Many times flight over the marches gleams out on\r\n      him as a last guidance in such bewilderment: nevertheless he\r\n      continues here: struggling always to hope the best, not from new\r\n      organisation but from happy Counter-Revolution and return to the\r\n      old. For the rest it is clear to him that this same National\r\n      Federation, and universal swearing and fraternising of People and\r\n      Soldiers, has done “incalculable mischief.” So much that\r\n      fermented secretly has hereby got vent and become open: National\r\n      Guards and Soldiers of the line, solemnly embracing one another\r\n      on all parade-fields, drinking, swearing patriotic oaths, fall\r\n      into disorderly street-processions, constitutional unmilitary\r\n      exclamations and hurrahings. On which account the Regiment\r\n      Picardie, for one, has to be drawn out in the square of the\r\n      barracks, here at Metz, and sharply harangued by the General\r\n      himself; but expresses penitence.[311]\r\n\r\n      Far and near, as accounts testify, insubordination has begun\r\n      grumbling louder and louder. Officers have been seen shut up in\r\n      their mess-rooms; assaulted with clamorous demands, not without\r\n      menaces. The insubordinate ringleader is dismissed with “yellow\r\n      furlough,” yellow infamous thing they call _cartouche jaune:_ but\r\n      ten new ringleaders rise in his stead, and the yellow _cartouche_\r\n      ceases to be thought disgraceful. “Within a fortnight,” or at\r\n      furthest a month, of that sublime Feast of Pikes, the whole\r\n      French Army, demanding Arrears, forming Reading Clubs,\r\n      frequenting Popular Societies, is in a state which Bouillé can\r\n      call by no name but that of mutiny. Bouillé knows it as few do;\r\n      and speaks by dire experience. Take one instance instead of many.\r\n\r\n      It is still an early day of August, the precise date now\r\n      undiscoverable, when Bouillé, about to set out for the waters of\r\n      Aix la Chapelle, is once more suddenly summoned to the barracks\r\n      of Metz. The soldiers stand ranked in fighting order, muskets\r\n      loaded, the officers all there on compulsion; and require, with\r\n      many-voiced emphasis, to have their arrears paid. Picardie was\r\n      penitent; but we see it has relapsed: the wide space bristles and\r\n      lours with mere mutinous armed men. Brave Bouillé advances to the\r\n      nearest Regiment, opens his commanding lips to harangue; obtains\r\n      nothing but querulous-indignant discordance, and the sound of so\r\n      many thousand livres legally due. The moment is trying; there are\r\n      some ten thousand soldiers now in Metz, and one spirit seems to\r\n      have spread among them.\r\n\r\n      Bouillé is firm as the adamant; but what shall he do? A German\r\n      Regiment, named of Salm, is thought to be of better temper:\r\n      nevertheless Salm too may have heard of the precept, _Thou shalt\r\n      not steal;_ Salm too may know that money is money. Bouillé walks\r\n      trustfully towards the Regiment de Salm, speaks trustful words;\r\n      but here again is answered by the cry of forty-four thousand\r\n      livres odd sous. A cry waxing more and more vociferous, as Salm’s\r\n      humour mounts; which cry, as it will produce no cash or promise\r\n      of cash, ends in the wide simultaneous whirr of shouldered\r\n      muskets, and a determined quick-time march on the part of\r\n      Salm—towards its Colonel’s house, in the next street, there to\r\n      seize the colours and military chest. Thus does Salm, for its\r\n      part; strong in the faith that _meum_ is not _tuum_, that fair\r\n      speeches are not forty-four thousand livres odd sous.\r\n\r\n      Unrestrainable! Salm tramps to military time, quick consuming the\r\n      way. Bouillé and the officers, drawing sword, have to dash into\r\n      double quick _pas-de-charge_, or unmilitary running; to get the\r\n      start; to station themselves on the outer staircase, and stand\r\n      there with what of death-defiance and sharp steel they have; Salm\r\n      truculently coiling itself up, rank after rank, opposite them, in\r\n      such humour as we can fancy, which happily has not yet mounted to\r\n      the murder-pitch. There will Bouillé stand, certain at least of\r\n      _one_ man’s purpose; in grim calmness, awaiting the issue. What\r\n      the intrepidest of men and generals can do is done. Bouillé,\r\n      though there is a barricading picket at each end of the street,\r\n      and death under his eyes, contrives to send for a Dragoon\r\n      Regiment with orders to charge: the dragoon officers mount; the\r\n      dragoon men will not: hope is none there for him. The street, as\r\n      we say, barricaded; the Earth all shut out, only the indifferent\r\n      heavenly Vault overhead: perhaps here or there a timorous\r\n      householder peering out of window, with prayer for Bouillé;\r\n      copious Rascality, on the pavement, with prayer for Salm: there\r\n      do the two parties stand;—like chariots locked in a narrow\r\n      thoroughfare; like locked wrestlers at a dead-grip! For two hours\r\n      they stand; Bouillé’s sword glittering in his hand, adamantine\r\n      resolution clouding his brows: for two hours by the clocks of\r\n      Metz. Moody-silent stands Salm, with occasional clangour; but\r\n      does not fire. Rascality from time to time urges some grenadier\r\n      to level his musket at the General; who looks on it as a bronze\r\n      General would; and always some corporal or other strikes it up.\r\n\r\n      In such remarkable attitude, standing on that staircase for two\r\n      hours, does brave Bouillé, long a shadow, dawn on us visibly out\r\n      of the dimness, and become a person. For the rest, since Salm has\r\n      not shot him at the first instant, and since in himself there is\r\n      no variableness, the danger will diminish. The Mayor, “a man\r\n      infinitely respectable,” with his Municipals and tricolor sashes,\r\n      finally gains entrance; remonstrates, perorates, promises; gets\r\n      Salm persuaded home to its barracks. Next day, our respectable\r\n      Mayor lending the money, the officers pay down the _half_ of the\r\n      demand in ready cash. With which liquidation Salm pacifies\r\n      itself, and for the present all is hushed up, as much as may\r\n      be.[312]\r\n\r\n      Such scenes as this of Metz, or preparations and demonstrations\r\n      towards such, are universal over France: Dampmartin, with his\r\n      knotted forage-cords and piled chamois jackets, is at Strasburg\r\n      in the South-East; in these same days or rather nights, Royal\r\n      Champagne is “shouting _Vive la Nation, au diable les\r\n      Aristocrates_, with some thirty lit candles,” at Hesdin, on the\r\n      far North-West. ‘The garrison of Bitche,’ Deputy Rewbell is sorry\r\n      to state, ‘went out of the town, with drums beating; deposed its\r\n      officers; and then returned into the town, sabre in hand.’[313]\r\n      Ought not a National Assembly to occupy itself with these\r\n      objects? Military France is everywhere full of sour inflammatory\r\n      humour, which exhales itself fuliginously, this way or that: a\r\n      whole continent of smoking flax; which, blown on here or there by\r\n      any angry wind, might so easily start into a blaze, into a\r\n      continent of fire!\r\n\r\n      Constitutional Patriotism is in deep natural alarm at these\r\n      things. The august Assembly sits diligently deliberating; dare\r\n      nowise resolve, with Mirabeau, on an instantaneous disbandment\r\n      and extinction; finds that a course of palliatives is easier. But\r\n      at least and lowest, this grievance of the Arrears shall be\r\n      rectified. A plan, much noised of in those days, under the name\r\n      “Decree of the Sixth of August,” has been devised for that.\r\n      Inspectors shall visit all armies; and, with certain elected\r\n      corporals and “soldiers able to write,” verify what arrears and\r\n      peculations do lie due, and make them good. Well, if in this way\r\n      the smoky heat be cooled down; if it be not, as we say,\r\n      ventilated over-much, or, by sparks and collision somewhere, sent\r\n      _up!_\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.2.IV.\r\n      Arrears at Nanci.\r\n\r\n      We are to remark, however, that of all districts, this of\r\n      Bouillé’s seems the inflammablest. It was always to Bouillé and\r\n      Metz that Royalty would fly: Austria lies near; here more than\r\n      elsewhere must the disunited People look over the borders, into a\r\n      dim sea of Foreign Politics and Diplomacies, with hope or\r\n      apprehension, with mutual exasperation.\r\n\r\n      It was but in these days that certain Austrian troops, marching\r\n      peaceably across an angle of this region, seemed an Invasion\r\n      realised; and there rushed towards Stenai, with musket on\r\n      shoulder, from all the winds, some thirty thousand National\r\n      Guards, to inquire what the matter was.[314] A matter of mere\r\n      diplomacy it proved; the Austrian Kaiser, in haste to get to\r\n      Belgium, had bargained for this short cut. The infinite dim\r\n      movement of European Politics waved a skirt over these spaces,\r\n      passing on its way; like the passing shadow of a condor; and such\r\n      a winged flight of thirty thousand, with mixed cackling and\r\n      crowing, rose in consequence! For, in addition to all, this\r\n      people, as we said, is much divided: Aristocrats abound;\r\n      Patriotism has both Aristocrats and Austrians to watch. It is\r\n      Lorraine, this region; not so illuminated as old France: it\r\n      remembers ancient Feudalisms; nay, within man’s memory, it had a\r\n      Court and King of its own, or indeed the splendour of a Court and\r\n      King, without the burden. Then, contrariwise, the Mother Society,\r\n      which sits in the Jacobins Church at Paris, has Daughters in the\r\n      Towns here; shrill-tongued, driven acrid: consider how the memory\r\n      of good King Stanislaus, and ages of Imperial Feudalism, may\r\n      comport with this New acrid Evangel, and what a virulence of\r\n      discord there may be! In all which, the Soldiery, officers on one\r\n      side, private men on the other, takes part, and now indeed\r\n      principal part; a Soldiery, moreover, all the hotter here as it\r\n      lies the denser, the frontier Province requiring more of it.\r\n\r\n      So stands Lorraine: but the capital City, more especially so. The\r\n      pleasant City of Nanci, which faded Feudalism loves, where King\r\n      Stanislaus personally dwelt and shone, has an Aristocrat\r\n      Municipality, and then also a Daughter Society: it has some forty\r\n      thousand divided souls of population; and three large Regiments,\r\n      one of which is Swiss Château-Vieux, dear to Patriotism ever\r\n      since it refused fighting, or was thought to refuse, in the\r\n      Bastille days. Here unhappily all evil influences seem to meet\r\n      concentered; here, of all places, may jealousy and heat evolve\r\n      itself. These many months, accordingly, man has been set against\r\n      man, Washed against Unwashed; Patriot Soldier against Aristocrat\r\n      Captain, ever the more bitterly; and a long score of grudges has\r\n      been running up.\r\n\r\n      Nameable grudges, and likewise unnameable: for there is a\r\n      punctual nature in Wrath; and daily, were there but glances of\r\n      the eye, tones of the voice, and minutest commissions or\r\n      omissions, it will jot down somewhat, to account, under the head\r\n      of sundries, which always swells the sum-total. For example, in\r\n      April last, in those times of preliminary Federation, when\r\n      National Guards and Soldiers were every where swearing\r\n      brotherhood, and all France was locally federating, preparing for\r\n      the grand National Feast of Pikes, it was observed that these\r\n      Nanci Officers threw cold water on the whole brotherly business;\r\n      that they first hung back from appearing at the Nanci Federation;\r\n      then did appear, but in mere _rédingote_ and undress, with\r\n      scarcely a clean shirt on; nay that one of them, as the National\r\n      Colours flaunted by in that solemn moment, did, without visible\r\n      necessity, take occasion to _spit_.[315]\r\n\r\n      Small “sundries as per journal,” but then incessant ones! The\r\n      Aristocrat Municipality, pretending to be Constitutional, keeps\r\n      mostly quiet; not so the Daughter Society, the five thousand\r\n      adult male Patriots of the place, still less the five thousand\r\n      female: not so the young, whiskered or whiskerless,\r\n      four-generation Noblesse in epaulettes; the grim Patriot Swiss of\r\n      Château-Vieux, effervescent infantry of Regiment du Roi, hot\r\n      troopers of Mestre-de-Camp! Walled Nanci, which stands so bright\r\n      and trim, with its straight streets, spacious squares, and\r\n      Stanislaus’ Architecture, on the fruitful alluvium of the\r\n      Meurthe; so bright, amid the yellow cornfields in these\r\n      Reaper-Months,—is inwardly but a den of discord, anxiety,\r\n      inflammability, not far from exploding. Let Bouillé look to it.\r\n      If that universal military heat, which we liken to a vast\r\n      continent of smoking flax, do any where take fire, his beard,\r\n      here in Lorraine and Nanci, may the most readily of all get\r\n      singed by it.\r\n\r\n      Bouillé, for his part, is busy enough, but only with the general\r\n      superintendence; getting his pacified Salm, and all other still\r\n      tolerable Regiments, marched out of Metz, to southward towns and\r\n      villages; to rural Cantonments as at Vic, Marsal and thereabout,\r\n      by the still waters; where is plenty of horse-forage, sequestered\r\n      parade-ground, and the soldier’s speculative faculty can be\r\n      stilled by drilling. Salm, as we said, received only half payment\r\n      of arrears; naturally not without grumbling. Nevertheless that\r\n      scene of the drawn sword may, after all, have raised Bouillé in\r\n      the mind of Salm; for men and soldiers love intrepidity and swift\r\n      inflexible decision, even when they suffer by it. As indeed is\r\n      not this fundamentally the quality of qualities for a man? A\r\n      quality which by itself is next to nothing, since inferior\r\n      animals, asses, dogs, even mules have it; yet, in due\r\n      combination, it is the indispensable basis of all.\r\n\r\n      Of Nanci and its heats, Bouillé, commander of the whole, knows\r\n      nothing special; understands generally that the troops in that\r\n      City are perhaps the _worst_.[316] The Officers there have it\r\n      all, as they have long had it, to themselves; and unhappily seem\r\n      to manage it ill. “Fifty yellow furloughs,” given out in one\r\n      batch, do surely betoken difficulties. But what was Patriotism to\r\n      think of certain light-fencing Fusileers “set on,” or supposed to\r\n      be set on, “to insult the Grenadier-club,” considerate\r\n      speculative Grenadiers, and that reading-room of theirs? With\r\n      shoutings, with hootings; till the speculative Grenadier drew his\r\n      side-arms too; and there ensued battery and duels! Nay more, are\r\n      not swashbucklers of the same stamp “sent out” visibly, or sent\r\n      out presumably, now in the dress of Soldiers to pick quarrels\r\n      with the Citizens; now, disguised as Citizens, to pick quarrels\r\n      with the Soldiers? For a certain Roussière, expert in fence, was\r\n      taken in the very fact; four Officers (presumably of tender\r\n      years) hounding him on, who thereupon fled precipitately!\r\n      Fence-master Roussière, haled to the guardhouse, had sentence of\r\n      three months’ imprisonment: but his comrades demanded “yellow\r\n      furlough” for _him_ of all persons; nay, thereafter they produced\r\n      him on parade; capped him in paper-helmet inscribed, _Iscariot;_\r\n      marched him to the gate of City; and there sternly commanded him\r\n      to vanish for evermore.\r\n\r\n      On all which suspicions, accusations and noisy procedure, and on\r\n      enough of the like continually accumulating, the Officer could\r\n      not but look with disdainful indignation; perhaps disdainfully\r\n      express the same in words, and “soon after fly over to the\r\n      Austrians.”\r\n\r\n      So that when it here as elsewhere comes to the question of\r\n      Arrears, the humour and procedure is of the bitterest: Regiment\r\n      Mestre-de-Camp getting, amid loud clamour, some three gold louis\r\n      a-man,—which have, as usual, to be borrowed from the\r\n      Municipality; Swiss Château-Vieux applying for the like, but\r\n      getting instead instantaneous _courrois_, or cat-o’-nine-tails,\r\n      with subsequent unsufferable hisses from the women and children;\r\n      Regiment du Roi, sick of hope deferred, at length seizing its\r\n      military chest, and marching it to quarters, but next day\r\n      marching it back again, through streets all struck\r\n      silent:—unordered paradings and clamours, not without strong\r\n      liquor; objurgation, insubordination; your military ranked\r\n      Arrangement going all (as the Typographers say of set types, in a\r\n      similar case) rapidly _to pie!_[317] Such is Nanci in these early\r\n      days of August; the sublime Feast of Pikes not yet a month old.\r\n\r\n      Constitutional Patriotism, at Paris and elsewhere, may well quake\r\n      at the news. War-Minister Latour du Pin runs breathless to the\r\n      National Assembly, with a written message that “all is burning,\r\n      _tout brûle, tout presse_.” The National Assembly, on spur of the\r\n      instant, renders such _Decret_, and “order to submit and repent,”\r\n      as he requires; if it will avail any thing. On the other hand,\r\n      Journalism, through all its throats, gives hoarse outcry,\r\n      condemnatory, elegiac-applausive. The Forty-eight Sections, lift\r\n      up voices; sonorous Brewer, or call him now _Colonel_ Santerre,\r\n      is not silent, in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. For, meanwhile, the\r\n      Nanci Soldiers have sent a Deputation of Ten, furnished with\r\n      documents and proofs; who will tell another story than the\r\n      “all-is-burning” one. Which deputed Ten, before ever they reach\r\n      the Assembly Hall, assiduous Latour du Pin picks up, and on\r\n      warrant of Mayor Bailly, claps in prison! Most\r\n      unconstitutionally; for they had officers’ furloughs. Whereupon\r\n      Saint-Antoine, in indignant uncertainty of the future, closes its\r\n      shops. Is Bouillé a traitor then, sold to Austria? In that case,\r\n      these poor private sentinels have revolted mainly out of\r\n      Patriotism?\r\n\r\n      New Deputation, Deputation of National Guardsmen now, sets forth\r\n      from Nanci to enlighten the Assembly. It meets the old deputed\r\n      Ten returning, quite unexpectedly _un_hanged; and proceeds\r\n      thereupon with better prospects; but effects nothing.\r\n      Deputations, Government Messengers, Orderlies at hand-gallops,\r\n      Alarms, thousand-voiced Rumours, go vibrating continually;\r\n      backwards and forwards,—scattering distraction. Not till the last\r\n      week of August does M. de Malseigne, selected as Inspector, get\r\n      down to the scene of mutiny; with Authority, with cash, and\r\n      “Decree of the Sixth of August.” He now shall see these Arrears\r\n      liquidated, justice done, or at least tumult quashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.2.V.\r\n      Inspector Malseigne.\r\n\r\n      Of Inspector Malseigne we discern, by direct light, that he is\r\n      “of Herculean stature;” and infer, with probability, that he is\r\n      of truculent moustachioed aspect,—for _Royalist_ Officers now\r\n      leave the upper lip unshaven; that he is of indomitable\r\n      bull-heart; and also, unfortunately, of thick bull-head.\r\n\r\n      On Tuesday the 24th of August, 1790, he opens session as\r\n      Inspecting Commissioner; meets those “elected corporals, and\r\n      soldiers that can write.” He finds the accounts of Château-Vieux\r\n      to be complex; to require delay and reference: he takes to\r\n      haranguing, to reprimanding; ends amid audible grumbling. Next\r\n      morning, he resumes session, not at the Townhall as prudent\r\n      Municipals counselled, but once more at the barracks.\r\n      Unfortunately Château-Vieux, grumbling all night, will now hear\r\n      of no delay or reference; from reprimanding on his part, it goes\r\n      to bullying,—answered with continual cries of ‘_Jugez tout de\r\n      suite_, Judge it at once;’ whereupon M. de Malseigne will off in\r\n      a huff. But lo, Château Vieux, swarming all about the\r\n      barrack-court, has sentries at every gate; M. de Malseigne,\r\n      demanding egress, cannot get it, though Commandant Denoue backs\r\n      him; can get only ‘_Jugez tout de suite_.’ Here is a nodus!\r\n\r\n      Bull-hearted M. de Malseigne draws his sword; and will force\r\n      egress. Confused splutter. M. de Malseigne’s sword breaks; he\r\n      snatches Commandant Denoue’s: the sentry is wounded. M. de\r\n      Malseigne, whom one is loath to kill, does force egress,—followed\r\n      by Château-Vieux all in disarray; a spectacle to Nanci. M. de\r\n      Malseigne walks at a sharp pace, yet never runs; wheeling from\r\n      time to time, with menaces and movements of fence; and so reaches\r\n      Denoue’s house, unhurt; which house Château-Vieux, in an agitated\r\n      manner, invests,—hindered as yet from entering, by a crowd of\r\n      officers formed on the staircase. M. de Malseigne retreats by\r\n      back ways to the Townhall, flustered though undaunted; amid an\r\n      escort of National Guards. From the Townhall he, on the morrow,\r\n      emits fresh orders, fresh plans of settlement with Château-Vieux;\r\n      to none of which will Château-Vieux listen: whereupon finally he,\r\n      amid noise enough, emits order that Château-Vieux shall march on\r\n      the morrow morning, and quarter at Sarre Louis. Château-Vieux\r\n      flatly refuses marching; M. de Malseigne “takes _act_,” due\r\n      notarial protest, of such refusal,—if happily that may avail him.\r\n\r\n      This is end of Thursday; and, indeed, of M. de Malseigne’s\r\n      Inspectorship, which has lasted some fifty hours. To such length,\r\n      in fifty hours, has he unfortunately brought it. Mestre-de-Camp\r\n      and Regiment du Roi hang, as it were, fluttering: Château-Vieux\r\n      is clean gone, in what way we see. Over night, an Aide-de-Camp of\r\n      Lafayette’s, stationed here for such emergency, sends swift\r\n      emissaries far and wide, to summon National Guards. The slumber\r\n      of the country is broken by clattering hoofs, by loud fraternal\r\n      knockings; every where the Constitutional Patriot must clutch his\r\n      fighting-gear, and take the road for Nanci.\r\n\r\n      And thus the Herculean Inspector has sat all Thursday, among\r\n      terror-struck Municipals, a centre of confused noise: all\r\n      Thursday, Friday, and till Saturday towards noon. Château-Vieux,\r\n      in spite of the notarial protest, will not march a step. As many\r\n      as four thousand National Guards are dropping or pouring in;\r\n      uncertain what is expected of them, still more uncertain what\r\n      will be obtained of them. For all is uncertainty, commotion, and\r\n      suspicion: there goes a word that Bouillé, beginning to bestir\r\n      himself in the rural Cantonments eastward, is but a Royalist\r\n      traitor; that Château-Vieux and Patriotism are sold to Austria,\r\n      of which latter M. de Malseigne is probably some agent.\r\n      Mestre-de-Camp and Roi flutter still more questionably:\r\n      Château-Vieux, far from marching, “waves red flags out of two\r\n      carriages,” in a passionate manner, along the streets; and next\r\n      morning answers its Officers: ‘Pay us, then; and we will march\r\n      with you to the world’s end!’\r\n\r\n      Under which circumstances, towards noon on Saturday, M. de\r\n      Malseigne thinks it were good perhaps to inspect the ramparts,—on\r\n      horseback. He mounts, accordingly, with escort of three troopers.\r\n      At the gate of the city, he bids two of them wait for his return;\r\n      and with the third, a trooper to be depended upon, he—gallops off\r\n      for Lunéville; where lies a certain Carabineer Regiment not yet\r\n      in a mutinous state! The two left troopers soon get uneasy;\r\n      discover how it is, and give the alarm. Mestre-de-Camp, to the\r\n      number of a hundred, saddles in frantic haste, as if sold to\r\n      Austria; gallops out pellmell in chase of its Inspector. And so\r\n      they spur, and the Inspector spurs; careering, with noise and\r\n      jingle, up the valley of the River Meurthe, towards Lunéville and\r\n      the midday sun: through an astonished country; indeed almost\r\n      their own astonishment.\r\n\r\n      What a hunt, Actæon-like;—which Actæon de Malseigne happily\r\n      _gains._ To arms, ye Carabineers of Lunéville: to chastise\r\n      mutinous men, insulting your General Officer, insulting your own\r\n      quarters;—above all things, fire _soon_, lest there be parleying\r\n      and ye refuse to fire! The Carabineers fire soon, exploding upon\r\n      the first stragglers of Mestre-de-Camp; who shrink at the very\r\n      flash, and fall back hastily on Nanci, in a state not far from\r\n      distraction. Panic and fury: sold to Austria without an _if;_ so\r\n      much per regiment, the very sums can be specified; and traitorous\r\n      Malseigne is fled! Help, O Heaven; help, thou Earth,—ye unwashed\r\n      Patriots; ye too are sold like us!\r\n\r\n      Effervescent Regiment du Roi primes its firelocks, Mestre-de-Camp\r\n      saddles wholly: Commandant Denoue is seized, is flung in prison\r\n      with a “canvass shirt” (_sarreau de toile_) about him;\r\n      Château-Vieux bursts up the magazines; distributes “three\r\n      thousand fusils” to a Patriot people: Austria shall have a hot\r\n      bargain. Alas, the unhappy hunting-dogs, as we said, have _hunted\r\n      away_ their huntsman; and do now run howling and baying, on what\r\n      trail they know not; nigh rabid!\r\n\r\n      And so there is tumultuous march of men, through the night; with\r\n      halt on the heights of Flinval, whence Lunéville can be seen all\r\n      illuminated. Then there is parley, at four in the morning; and\r\n      reparley; finally there is agreement: the Carabineers give in;\r\n      Malseigne is surrendered, with apologies on all sides. After\r\n      weary confused hours, he is even got under way; the Lunévillers\r\n      all turning out, in the idle Sunday, to see such departure:\r\n      home-going of mutinous Mestre-de-Camp with its Inspector captive.\r\n      Mestre-de-Camp accordingly marches; the Lunévillers look. See! at\r\n      the corner of the first street, our Inspector bounds off again,\r\n      bull-hearted as he is; amid the slash of sabres, the crackle of\r\n      musketry; and escapes, full gallop, with only a ball lodged in\r\n      his buff-_jerkin_. The Herculean man! And yet it is an escape to\r\n      no purpose. For the Carabineers, to whom after the hardest\r\n      Sunday’s ride on record, he has come circling back, “stand\r\n      deliberating by their nocturnal watch-fires;” deliberating of\r\n      Austria, of traitors, and the rage of Mestre-de-Camp. So that, on\r\n      the whole, the next sight we have is that of M. de Malseigne, on\r\n      the Monday afternoon, faring bull-hearted through the streets of\r\n      Nanci; in open carriage, a soldier standing over him with drawn\r\n      sword; amid the “furies of the women,” hedges of National Guards,\r\n      and confusion of Babel: to the Prison beside Commandant Denoue!\r\n      That finally is the lodging of Inspector Malseigne.[318]\r\n\r\n      Surely it is time Bouillé were drawing near. The Country all\r\n      round, alarmed with watchfires, illuminated towns, and marching\r\n      and rout, has been sleepless these several nights. Nanci, with\r\n      its uncertain National Guards, with its distributed fusils,\r\n      mutinous soldiers, black panic and redhot ire, is not a City but\r\n      a Bedlam.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.2.VI.\r\n      Bouillé at Nanci.\r\n\r\n      Haste with help, thou brave Bouillé: if swift help come not, all\r\n      is now verily “burning;” and may burn,—to what lengths and\r\n      breadths! Much, in these hours, depends on Bouillé; as it shall\r\n      now fare with him, the whole Future may be this way or be that.\r\n      If, for example, he were to loiter dubitating, and not come: if\r\n      he were to come, and fail: the whole Soldiery of France to blaze\r\n      into mutiny, National Guards going some this way, some that; and\r\n      Royalism to draw its rapier, and Sansculottism to snatch its\r\n      pike; and the Spirit if Jacobinism, as yet young, girt with\r\n      sun-rays, to grow instantaneously mature, girt with hell-fire,—as\r\n      mortals, in one night of deadly crisis, have had their heads\r\n      turned gray!\r\n\r\n      Brave Bouillé is advancing fast, with the old inflexibility;\r\n      gathering himself, unhappily “in small affluences,” from East,\r\n      from West and North; and now on Tuesday morning, the last day of\r\n      the month, he stands all concentred, unhappily still in small\r\n      force, at the village of Frouarde, within some few miles. Son of\r\n      Adam with a more dubious task before him is not in the world this\r\n      Tuesday morning. A weltering inflammable sea of doubt and peril,\r\n      and Bouillé sure of simply one thing, his own determination.\r\n      Which one thing, indeed, may be worth many. He puts a most firm\r\n      face on the matter: “Submission, or unsparing battle and\r\n      destruction; twenty-four hours to make your choice:” this was the\r\n      tenor of his Proclamation; thirty copies of which he sent\r\n      yesterday to Nanci:—all which, we find, were intercepted and not\r\n      posted.[319]\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, at half-past eleven, this morning, seemingly by way\r\n      of answer, there does wait on him at Frouarde, some Deputation\r\n      from the mutinous Regiments, from the Nanci Municipals, to see\r\n      what can be done. Bouillé receives this Deputation, “in a large\r\n      open court adjoining his lodging:” pacified Salm, and the rest,\r\n      attend also, being invited to do it,—all happily still in the\r\n      right humour. The Mutineers pronounce themselves with a\r\n      decisiveness, which to Bouillé seems insolence; and happily to\r\n      Salm also. Salm, forgetful of the Metz staircase and sabre,\r\n      demands that the scoundrels “be hanged” there and then. Bouillé\r\n      represses the hanging; but answers that mutinous Soldiers have\r\n      one course, and not more than one: To liberate, with heartfelt\r\n      contrition, Messieurs Denoue and de Malseigne; to get ready\r\n      forthwith for marching off, whither he shall order; and “submit\r\n      and repent,” as the National Assembly has decreed, as he\r\n      yesterday did in thirty printed Placards proclaim. These are his\r\n      terms, unalterable as the decrees of Destiny. Which terms as\r\n      they, the Mutineer deputies, seemingly do not accept, it were\r\n      good for them to vanish from this spot, and even promptly; with\r\n      him too, in few instants, the word will be, Forward! The Mutineer\r\n      deputies vanish, not unpromptly; the Municipal ones, anxious\r\n      beyond right for their own individualities, prefer abiding with\r\n      Bouillé.\r\n\r\n      Brave Bouillé, though he puts a most firm face on the matter,\r\n      knows his position full well: how at Nanci, what with rebellious\r\n      soldiers, with uncertain National Guards, and so many distributed\r\n      fusils, there rage and roar some ten thousand fighting men; while\r\n      with himself is scarcely the third part of that number, in\r\n      National Guards also uncertain, in mere pacified Regiments,—for\r\n      the present full of rage, and clamour to march; but whose rage\r\n      and clamour may next moment take such a fatal new figure. On the\r\n      top of one uncertain billow, therewith to calm billows! Bouillé\r\n      must “abandon himself to Fortune;” who is said sometimes to\r\n      favour the brave. At half-past twelve, the Mutineer deputies\r\n      having vanished, our drums beat; we march: for Nanci! Let Nanci\r\n      bethink itself, then; for Bouillé has thought and determined.\r\n\r\n      And yet how shall Nanci think: not a City but a Bedlam! Grim\r\n      Château-Vieux is for defence to the death; forces the\r\n      Municipality to order, by tap of drum, all citizens acquainted\r\n      with artillery to turn out, and assist in managing the cannon. On\r\n      the other hand, effervescent Regiment du Roi, is drawn up in its\r\n      barracks; quite disconsolate, hearing the humour Salm is in; and\r\n      ejaculates dolefully from its thousand throats: ‘_La loi, la\r\n      loi_, Law, law!’ Mestre-de-Camp blusters, with profane swearing,\r\n      in mixed terror and furor; National Guards look this way and\r\n      that, not knowing what to do. What a Bedlam-City: as many plans\r\n      as heads; all ordering, none obeying: quiet none,—except the\r\n      Dead, who sleep underground, having _done_ their fighting!\r\n\r\n      And, behold, Bouillé proves as good as his word: “at half-past\r\n      two” scouts report that he is within half a league of the gates;\r\n      rattling along, with cannon, and array; breathing nothing but\r\n      destruction. A new Deputation, Municipals, Mutineers, Officers,\r\n      goes out to meet him; with passionate entreaty for yet one other\r\n      hour. Bouillé grants an hour. Then, at the end thereof, no Denoue\r\n      or Malseigne appearing as promised, he rolls his drums, and again\r\n      takes the road. Towards four o’clock, the terror-struck Townsmen\r\n      may see him face to face. His cannons rattle there, in their\r\n      carriages; his vanguard is within thirty paces of the Gate\r\n      Stanislaus. Onward like a Planet, by appointed times, by law of\r\n      Nature! What next? Lo, flag of truce and chamade; conjuration to\r\n      halt: Malseigne and Denoue are on the street, coming hither; the\r\n      soldiers all repentant, ready to submit and march! Adamantine\r\n      Bouillé’s look alters not; yet the word _Halt_ is given: gladder\r\n      moment he never saw. Joy of joys! Malseigne and Denoue do verily\r\n      issue; escorted by National Guards; from streets all frantic,\r\n      with sale to Austria and so forth: they salute Bouillé,\r\n      unscathed. Bouillé steps aside to speak with them, and with other\r\n      heads of the Town there; having already ordered by what Gates and\r\n      Routes the mutineer Regiments shall file out.\r\n\r\n      Such colloquy with these two General Officers and other principal\r\n      Townsmen, was natural enough; nevertheless one wishes Bouillé had\r\n      postponed it, and _not_ stepped aside. Such tumultuous\r\n      inflammable masses, tumbling along, making way for each other;\r\n      this of keen nitrous oxide, that of sulphurous fire-damp,—were it\r\n      not well to stand _between_ them, keeping them well separate,\r\n      till the space be cleared? Numerous stragglers of Château-Vieux\r\n      and the rest have not marched with their main columns, which are\r\n      filing out by the appointed Gates, taking station in the open\r\n      meadows. National Guards are in a state of nearly distracted\r\n      uncertainty; the populace, armed and unharmed, roll openly\r\n      delirious,—betrayed, sold to the Austrians, sold to the\r\n      Aristocrats. There are loaded cannon with lit matches among them,\r\n      and Bouillé’s vanguard is halted within thirty paces of the Gate.\r\n      Command dwells not in that mad inflammable mass; which smoulders\r\n      and tumbles there, in blind smoky rage; which will not open the\r\n      Gate when summoned; says it will open the cannon’s throat\r\n      sooner!—Cannonade not, O Friends, or be it through my body! cries\r\n      heroic young Desilles, young Captain of _Roi_, clasping the\r\n      murderous engine in his arms, and holding it. Château-Vieux\r\n      Swiss, by main force, with oaths and menaces, wrench off the\r\n      heroic youth; who undaunted, amid still louder oaths seats\r\n      himself on the touch-hole. Amid still louder oaths; with ever\r\n      louder clangour,—and, alas, with the loud crackle of first one,\r\n      and then three other muskets; which explode into his body; which\r\n      roll _it_ in the dust,—and do also, in the loud madness of such\r\n      moment, bring lit cannon-match to ready priming; and so, with one\r\n      thunderous belch of grapeshot, blast some fifty of Bouillé’s\r\n      vanguard into air!\r\n\r\n      Fatal! That sputter of the first musket-shot has kindled such a\r\n      cannon-shot, such a death-blaze; and all is now redhot madness,\r\n      conflagration as of Tophet. With demoniac rage, the Bouillé\r\n      vanguard storms through that Gate Stanislaus; with fiery sweep,\r\n      sweeps Mutiny clear away, to death, or into shelters and cellars;\r\n      from which latter, again, Mutiny continues firing. The ranked\r\n      Regiments hear it in their meadow; they rush back again through\r\n      the nearest Gates; Bouillé gallops in, distracted, inaudible;—and\r\n      now has begun, in Nanci, as in that doomed Hall of the\r\n      Nibelungen, “a murder grim and great.”\r\n\r\n      Miserable: such scene of dismal aimless madness as the anger of\r\n      Heaven but rarely permits among men! From cellar or from garret,\r\n      from open street in front, from successive corners of\r\n      cross-streets on each hand, Château-Vieux and Patriotism keep up\r\n      the murderous rolling-fire, on murderous not Unpatriotic fires.\r\n      Your blue National Captain, riddled with balls, one hardly knows\r\n      on whose side fighting, requests to be laid on the colours to\r\n      die: the patriotic Woman (name not given, deed surviving) screams\r\n      to Château-Vieux that it must _not_ fire the other cannon; and\r\n      even flings a pail of water on it, since screaming avails\r\n      not.[320] Thou shalt fight; thou shalt not fight; and with whom\r\n      shalt thou fight! Could tumult awaken the old Dead, Burgundian\r\n      Charles the Bold might stir from under that Rotunda of his: never\r\n      since he, raging, sank in the ditches, and lost Life and Diamond,\r\n      was such a noise heard here.\r\n\r\n      Three thousand, as some count, lie mangled, gory; the half of\r\n      Château-Vieux has been shot, without need of Court Martial.\r\n      Cavalry, of Mestre-de-Camp or their foes, can do little. Regiment\r\n      du Roi was persuaded to its barracks; stands there palpitating.\r\n      Bouillé, armed with the terrors of the Law, and favoured of\r\n      Fortune, finally triumphs. In two murderous hours he has\r\n      penetrated to the grand Squares, dauntless, though with loss of\r\n      forty officers and five hundred men: the shattered remnants of\r\n      Château-Vieux are seeking covert. Regiment du Roi, not\r\n      effervescent now, alas no, but _having_ effervesced, will offer\r\n      to ground its arms; will “march in a quarter of an hour.” Nay\r\n      these poor effervesced require “escort” to march with, and get\r\n      it; though they are thousands strong, and have thirty\r\n      ball-cartridges a man! The Sun is not yet down, when Peace, which\r\n      might have come bloodless, has come bloody: the mutinous\r\n      Regiments are on march, doleful, on their three Routes; and from\r\n      Nanci rises wail of women and men, the voice of weeping and\r\n      desolation; the City weeping for its slain who awaken not. These\r\n      streets are empty but for victorious patrols.\r\n\r\n      Thus has Fortune, favouring the brave, dragged Bouillé, as\r\n      himself says, out of such a frightful peril, “by the hair of the\r\n      head.” An intrepid adamantine man this Bouillé:—had _he_ stood in\r\n      old Broglie’s place, in those Bastille days, it might have been\r\n      all different! He has extinguished mutiny, and immeasurable civil\r\n      war. Not for nothing, as we see; yet at a rate which he and\r\n      Constitutional Patriotism considers cheap. Nay, as for Bouillé,\r\n      he, urged by subsequent contradiction which arose, declares\r\n      coldly, it was rather against his own private mind, and more by\r\n      public military rule of duty, that he did extinguish\r\n      it,[321]—immeasurable civil war being now the only chance. Urged,\r\n      we say, by subsequent contradiction! Civil war, indeed, is Chaos;\r\n      and in all vital Chaos, there is new Order shaping itself free:\r\n      but what a faith this, that of all new Orders out of Chaos and\r\n      Possibility of Man and his Universe, Louis Sixteenth and\r\n      Two-Chamber Monarchy were precisely the one that would shape\r\n      itself! It is like undertaking to throw deuce-ace, say only five\r\n      hundred successive times, and any other throw to be fatal—for\r\n      Bouillé. Rather thank Fortune, and Heaven, always, thou intrepid\r\n      Bouillé; and let contradiction of its way! Civil war,\r\n      conflagrating universally over France at this moment, might have\r\n      led to one thing or to another thing: meanwhile, to _quench_\r\n      conflagration, wheresoever one finds it, wheresoever one can;\r\n      this, in all times, is the rule for man and General Officer.\r\n\r\n      But at Paris, so agitated and divided, fancy how it went, when\r\n      the continually vibrating Orderlies vibrated _thither_ at hand\r\n      gallop, with such questionable news! High is the gratulation; and\r\n      also deep the indignation. An august Assembly, by overwhelming\r\n      majorities, passionately thanks Bouillé; a King’s autograph, the\r\n      voices of all Loyal, all Constitutional men run to the same\r\n      tenor. A solemn National funeral-service, for the Law-defenders\r\n      slain at Nanci; is said and sung in the Champ de Mars; Bailly,\r\n      Lafayette and National Guards, all except the few that protested,\r\n      assist. With pomp and circumstance, with episcopal Calicoes in\r\n      tricolor girdles, Altar of Fatherland smoking with cassolettes,\r\n      or incense-kettles; the vast Champ-de-Mars wholly hung round with\r\n      black mortcloth,—which mortcloth and expenditure Marat thinks had\r\n      better have been laid out in bread, in these dear days, and given\r\n      to the hungry living Patriot.[322] On the other hand, living\r\n      Patriotism, and Saint-Antoine, which we have seen noisily closing\r\n      its shops and such like, assembles now “to the number of forty\r\n      thousand;” and, with loud cries, under the very windows of the\r\n      thanking National Assembly, demands revenge for murdered\r\n      Brothers, judgment on Bouillé, and instant dismissal of\r\n      War-Minister Latour du Pin.\r\n\r\n      At sound and sight of which things, if not War-Minister Latour,\r\n      yet “Adored Minister” Necker, sees good on the 3d of September\r\n      1790, to withdraw softly almost privily,—with an eye to the\r\n      “recovery of his health.” Home to native Switzerland; not as he\r\n      last came; lucky to reach it alive! Fifteen months ago, we saw\r\n      him coming, with escort of horse, with sound of clarion and\r\n      trumpet: and now at Arcis-sur-Aube, while he departs unescorted\r\n      soundless, the Populace and Municipals stop him as a fugitive,\r\n      are not unlike massacring him as a traitor; the National\r\n      Assembly, consulted on the matter, gives him free egress as a\r\n      nullity. Such an unstable “drift-mould of Accident” is the\r\n      substance of this lower world, for them that dwell in houses of\r\n      clay; so, especially in hot regions and times, do the proudest\r\n      palaces we build of it take wings, and become Sahara\r\n      sand-palaces, spinning many pillared in the whirlwind, and bury\r\n      us under their sand!—\r\n\r\n      In spite of the forty thousand, the National Assembly persists in\r\n      its thanks; and Royalist Latour du Pin continues Minister. The\r\n      forty thousand assemble next day, as loud as ever; roll towards\r\n      Latour’s Hôtel; find cannon on the porch-steps with flambeau lit;\r\n      and have to retire elsewhither, and digest their spleen, or\r\n      re-absorb it into the blood.\r\n\r\n      Over in Lorraine, meanwhile, they of the distributed fusils,\r\n      ringleaders of Mestre-de-Camp, of Roi, have got marked out for\r\n      judgment;—yet shall never get judged. Briefer is the doom of\r\n      Château-Vieux. Château-Vieux is, by Swiss law, given up for\r\n      instant trial in Court-Martial of its own officers. Which\r\n      Court-Martial, with all brevity (in not many hours), has hanged\r\n      some Twenty-three, on conspicuous gibbets; marched some\r\n      Three-score in chains to the Galleys; and so, to appearance,\r\n      finished the matter off. Hanged men do cease for ever from this\r\n      Earth; but out of chains and the Galleys there may be\r\n      resuscitation in triumph. Resuscitation for the chained Hero; and\r\n      even for the chained Scoundrel, or Semi-scoundrel! Scottish John\r\n      Knox, such World-Hero, as we know, sat once nevertheless pulling\r\n      grim-taciturn at the oar of French Galley, “in the _Water of\r\n      Lore;_” and even flung their Virgin-Mary over, instead of kissing\r\n      her,—as “a _pented bredd_,” or timber Virgin, who could naturally\r\n      swim.[323] So, ye of Château-Vieux, tug patiently, not without\r\n      hope!\r\n\r\n      But indeed at Nanci generally, Aristocracy rides triumphant,\r\n      rough. Bouillé is gone again, the second day; an Aristocrat\r\n      Municipality, with free course, is as cruel as it had before been\r\n      cowardly. The Daughter Society, as the mother of the whole\r\n      mischief, lies ignominiously suppressed; the Prisons can hold no\r\n      more; bereaved down-beaten Patriotism murmurs, not loud but deep.\r\n      Here and in the neighbouring Towns, “flattened balls” picked from\r\n      the streets of Nanci are worn at buttonholes: balls flattened in\r\n      carrying death to Patriotism; men wear them there, in perpetual\r\n      memento of revenge. Mutineer Deserters roam the woods; have to\r\n      demand charity at the musket’s end. All is dissolution, mutual\r\n      rancour, gloom and despair:—till National-Assembly Commissioners\r\n      arrive, with a steady gentle flame of Constitutionalism in their\r\n      hearts; who gently lift up the down-trodden, gently pull down the\r\n      too uplifted; reinstate the Daughter Society, recall the Mutineer\r\n      Deserter; gradually levelling, strive in all wise ways to smooth\r\n      and soothe. With such gradual mild levelling on the one side; as\r\n      with solemn funeral-service, Cassolettes, Courts-Martial,\r\n      National thanks,—all that Officiality can do is done. The\r\n      buttonhole will drop its flat ball; the black ashes, so far as\r\n      may be, get green again.\r\n\r\n      This is the “Affair of Nanci;” by some called the “Massacre of\r\n      Nanci;”—properly speaking, the unsightly _wrong_-side of that\r\n      thrice glorious Feast of Pikes, the right-side of which formed a\r\n      spectacle for the very gods. Right-side and wrong lie always so\r\n      near: the one was in July, in August the other! Theatres, the\r\n      theatres over in London, are bright with their pasteboard\r\n      simulacrum of that “Federation of the French People,” brought out\r\n      as Drama: this of Nanci, we may say, though not played in any\r\n      pasteboard Theatre, did for many months enact itself, and even\r\n      walk spectrally—in all French heads. For the news of it fly\r\n      pealing through all France; awakening, in town and village, in\r\n      clubroom, messroom, to the utmost borders, some mimic reflex or\r\n      imaginative repetition of the business; always with the angry\r\n      questionable assertion: It was right; It was wrong. Whereby come\r\n      controversies, duels, embitterment, vain jargon; the hastening\r\n      forward, the augmenting and intensifying of whatever new\r\n      explosions lie in store for us.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, at this cost or at that, the mutiny, as we say, is\r\n      stilled. The French Army has neither burst up in universal\r\n      simultaneous delirium; nor been at once disbanded, put an end to,\r\n      and made new again. It must die in the chronic manner, through\r\n      years, by inches; with partial revolts, as of Brest Sailors or\r\n      the like, which dare not spread; with men unhappy, insubordinate;\r\n      officers unhappier, in Royalist moustachioes, taking horse,\r\n      singly or in bodies, across the Rhine:[324] sick dissatisfaction,\r\n      sick disgust on both sides; the Army moribund, fit for no\r\n      duty:—till it do, in that unexpected manner, Phoenix-like, with\r\n      long throes, get both dead and newborn; then start forth strong,\r\n      nay stronger and even strongest.\r\n\r\n      Thus much was the brave Bouillé hitherto fated to do. Wherewith\r\n      let him again fade into dimness; and at Metz or the rural\r\n      Cantonments, assiduously drilling, mysteriously diplomatising, in\r\n      scheme within scheme, hover as formerly a faint shadow, the hope\r\n      of Royalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 2.III.\r\n      THE TUILERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.I.\r\n      Epimenides.\r\n\r\n      How true that there is nothing dead in this Universe; that what\r\n      we call dead is only changed, its forces working in inverse\r\n      order! “The leaf that lies rotting in moist winds,” says one,\r\n      “has still force; else how could it _rot?_” Our whole Universe is\r\n      but an infinite Complex of Forces; thousandfold, from Gravitation\r\n      up to Thought and Will; man’s Freedom environed with Necessity of\r\n      Nature: in all which nothing at any moment slumbers, but all is\r\n      for ever awake and busy. The thing that lies isolated inactive\r\n      thou shalt nowhere discover; seek every where from the granite\r\n      mountain, slow-mouldering since Creation, to the passing\r\n      cloud-vapour, to the living man; to the action, to the spoken\r\n      word of man. The word that is spoken, as we know,\r\n      flies-irrevocable: not less, but more, the action that is done.\r\n      “The gods themselves,” sings Pindar, “cannot annihilate the\r\n      action that is done.” No: this, once done, is done always; cast\r\n      forth into endless Time; and, long conspicuous or soon hidden,\r\n      must verily work and grow for ever there, an indestructible new\r\n      element in the Infinite of Things. Or, indeed, what _is_ this\r\n      Infinite of Things itself, which men name Universe, but an\r\n      action, a sum-total of Actions and Activities? The living\r\n      ready-made sum-total of these three,—which Calculation cannot\r\n      add, cannot bring on its tablets; yet the sum, we say, is written\r\n      visible: All that has been done, All that is doing, All that will\r\n      be done! Understand it well, the Thing thou beholdest, that Thing\r\n      is an Action, the product and expression of exerted Force: the\r\n      All of Things is an infinite conjugation of the verb _To do._\r\n      Shoreless Fountain-Ocean of Force, of power to _do;_ wherein\r\n      Force rolls and circles, billowing, many-streamed, harmonious;\r\n      wide as Immensity, deep as Eternity; beautiful and terrible, not\r\n      to be comprehended: this is what man names Existence and\r\n      Universe; this thousand-tinted Flame-image, at once veil and\r\n      revelation, reflex such as he, in his poor brain and heart, can\r\n      paint, of One Unnameable dwelling in inaccessible light! From\r\n      beyond the Star-galaxies, from before the Beginning of Days, it\r\n      billows and rolls,—round _thee_, nay thyself art of it, in this\r\n      point of Space where thou now standest, in this moment which thy\r\n      clock measures.\r\n\r\n      Or apart from all Transcendentalism, is it not a plain truth of\r\n      sense, which the duller mind can even consider as a truism, that\r\n      human things wholly are in continual movement, and action and\r\n      reaction; working continually forward, phasis after phasis, by\r\n      unalterable laws, towards prescribed issues? How often must we\r\n      say, and yet not rightly lay to heart: The seed that is sown, it\r\n      will spring! Given the summer’s blossoming, then there is also\r\n      given the autumnal withering: so is it ordered not with\r\n      seedfields only, but with transactions, arrangements,\r\n      philosophies, societies, French Revolutions, whatsoever man works\r\n      with in this lower world. The Beginning holds in it the End, and\r\n      all that leads thereto; as the acorn does the oak and its\r\n      fortunes. Solemn enough, did we think of it,—which unhappily and\r\n      also happily we do not very much! Thou there canst begin; the\r\n      Beginning is for thee, and there: but where, and of what sort,\r\n      and for whom will the End be? All grows, and seeks and endures\r\n      its destinies: consider likewise how much grows, as the trees do,\r\n      whether _we_ think of it or not. So that when your Epimenides,\r\n      your somnolent Peter Klaus, since named Rip van Winkle, awakens\r\n      again, he finds it a changed world. In that seven-years’ sleep of\r\n      his, so much has changed! All that is without us will change\r\n      while we think not of it; much even that is within us. The truth\r\n      that was yesterday a restless Problem, has today grown a Belief\r\n      burning to be uttered: on the morrow, contradiction has\r\n      exasperated it into mad Fanaticism; obstruction has dulled it\r\n      into sick Inertness; it is sinking towards silence, of\r\n      satisfaction or of resignation. Today is not Yesterday, for man\r\n      or for thing. Yesterday there was the oath of Love; today has\r\n      come the curse of Hate. Not willingly: ah, no; but it could not\r\n      help coming. The golden radiance of youth, would it willingly\r\n      have tarnished itself into the dimness of old age?—Fearful: how\r\n      we stand enveloped, deep-sunk, in that Mystery of TIME; and are\r\n      Sons of Time; fashioned and woven out of Time; and on us, and on\r\n      all that we have, or see, or do, is written: Rest not, Continue\r\n      not, Forward to thy doom!\r\n\r\n      But in seasons of Revolution, which indeed distinguish themselves\r\n      from common seasons by their _velocity_ mainly, your miraculous\r\n      Seven-sleeper might, with miracle enough, wake _sooner:_ not by\r\n      the century, or seven years, need he sleep; often not by the\r\n      seven months. Fancy, for example, some new Peter Klaus, sated\r\n      with the jubilee of that Federation day, had lain down, say\r\n      directly after the Blessing of Talleyrand; and, reckoning it all\r\n      safe _now_, had fallen composedly asleep under the timber-work of\r\n      the Fatherland’s Altar; to sleep there, not twenty-one years, but\r\n      as it were year and day. The cannonading of Nanci, so far off,\r\n      does not disturb him; nor does the black mortcloth, close at\r\n      hand, nor the requiems chanted, and minute guns, incense-pans and\r\n      concourse right over his head: none of these; but Peter sleeps\r\n      through them all. Through one circling year, as we say; from July\r\n      14th of 1790, till July the 17th of 1791: but on that latter day,\r\n      no Klaus, nor most leaden Epimenides, only the Dead could\r\n      continue sleeping; and so our miraculous Peter Klaus awakens.\r\n      With what eyes, O Peter! Earth and sky have still their joyous\r\n      July look, and the Champ-de-Mars is multitudinous with men: but\r\n      the jubilee-huzzahing has become Bedlam-shrieking, of terror and\r\n      revenge; not blessing of Talleyrand, or any blessing, but\r\n      cursing, imprecation and shrill wail; our cannon-salvoes are\r\n      turned to sharp shot; for swinging of incense-pans and\r\n      Eighty-three Departmental Banners, we have waving of the one\r\n      sanguinous _Drapeau-Rouge_.—Thou foolish Klaus! The one lay in\r\n      the other, the one _was_ the other _minus_ Time; even as\r\n      Hannibal’s rock-rending vinegar lay in the sweet new wine. That\r\n      sweet Federation was of last year; this sour Divulsion is the\r\n      self-same substance, only older by the appointed days.\r\n\r\n      No miraculous Klaus or Epimenides sleeps in these times: and yet,\r\n      may not many a man, if of due opacity and levity, act the same\r\n      miracle in a natural way; we mean, with his eyes open? Eyes has\r\n      he, but he sees not, except what is under his nose. With a\r\n      sparkling briskness of glance, as if he not only saw but saw\r\n      through, such a one goes whisking, assiduous, in his circle of\r\n      officialities; not dreaming but that _it_ is the whole world: as,\r\n      indeed, where your vision terminates, does not inanity begin\r\n      _there_, and the world’s end clearly declares itself—to you?\r\n      Whereby our brisk sparkling assiduous official person (call him,\r\n      for instance, Lafayette), suddenly startled, after year and day,\r\n      by huge grape-shot tumult, stares not less astonished at it than\r\n      Peter Klaus would have done. Such natural-miracle Lafayette can\r\n      perform; and indeed not he only but most other officials,\r\n      non-officials, and generally the whole French People can perform\r\n      it; and do bounce up, ever and anon, like amazed Seven-sleepers\r\n      awakening; awakening amazed at the noise they themselves _make_.\r\n      So strangely is Freedom, as we say, environed in Necessity; such\r\n      a singular Somnambulism, of Conscious and Unconscious, of\r\n      Voluntary and Involuntary, is this life of man. If any where in\r\n      the world there was astonishment that the Federation Oath went\r\n      into grape-shot, surely of all persons the French, first swearers\r\n      and then shooters, felt astonished the most.\r\n\r\n      Alas, offences must come. The sublime Feast of Pikes, with its\r\n      effulgence of brotherly love, unknown since the Age of Gold, has\r\n      changed nothing. That prurient heat in Twenty-five millions of\r\n      hearts is not cooled thereby; but is still hot, nay hotter. Lift\r\n      off the pressure of command from so many millions; all pressure\r\n      or binding rule, except such melodramatic Federation Oath as they\r\n      have bound _themselves_ with! For _Thou shalt_ was from of old\r\n      the condition of man’s being, and his weal and blessedness was in\r\n      obeying that. Wo for him when, were it on hest of the clearest\r\n      necessity, rebellion, disloyal isolation, and mere _I will_,\r\n      becomes his rule! But the Gospel of Jean-Jacques has come, and\r\n      the first Sacrament of it has been celebrated: all things, as we\r\n      say, are got into hot and hotter prurience; and must go on\r\n      pruriently fermenting, in continual change noted or unnoted.\r\n\r\n      “Worn out with disgusts,” Captain after Captain, in Royalist\r\n      moustachioes, mounts his warhorse, or his Rozinante war-garron,\r\n      and rides minatory across the Rhine; till all have ridden.\r\n      Neither does civic Emigration cease: Seigneur after Seigneur\r\n      must, in like manner, ride or roll; impelled to it, and even\r\n      compelled. For the very Peasants despise him in that he dare not\r\n      join his order and fight.[325] Can he bear to have a Distaff, a\r\n      _Quenouille_ sent to him; say in copper-plate shadow, by post; or\r\n      fixed up in wooden reality over his gate-lintel: as if he were no\r\n      Hercules but an Omphale? Such scutcheon they forward to him\r\n      diligently from behind the Rhine; till he too bestir himself and\r\n      march, and in sour humour, another Lord of Land is gone, _not_\r\n      taking the Land with him. Nay, what of Captains and emigrating\r\n      Seigneurs? There is not an angry word on any of those Twenty-five\r\n      million French tongues, and indeed not an angry thought in their\r\n      hearts, but is some fraction of the great Battle. Add many\r\n      successions of angry words together, you have the manual brawl;\r\n      add brawls together, with the festering sorrows they leave, and\r\n      they rise to riots and revolts. One reverend thing after another\r\n      ceases to meet reverence: in visible material combustion, château\r\n      after château mounts up; in spiritual invisible combustion, one\r\n      authority after another. With noise and glare, or noisily and\r\n      unnoted, a whole Old System of things is vanishing piecemeal: on\r\n      the morrow thou shalt look and it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.II.\r\n      The Wakeful.\r\n\r\n      Sleep who will, cradled in hope and short vision, like Lafayette,\r\n      “who always in the danger done sees the last danger that will\r\n      threaten him,”—Time is not sleeping, nor Time’s seedfield.\r\n\r\n      That sacred Herald’s-College of a _new_ Dynasty; we mean the\r\n      Sixty and odd Billstickers with their leaden badges, are not\r\n      sleeping. Daily they, with pastepot and cross-staff, new clothe\r\n      the walls of Paris in colours of the rainbow: authoritative\r\n      heraldic, as we say, or indeed almost magical thaumaturgic; for\r\n      no Placard-Journal that they paste but will convince some soul or\r\n      souls of man. The Hawkers bawl; and the Balladsingers: great\r\n      Journalism blows and blusters, through all its throats, forth\r\n      from Paris towards all corners of France, like an Aeolus’ Cave;\r\n      keeping alive all manner of fires.\r\n\r\n      Throats or Journals there are, as men count,[326] to the number\r\n      of some hundred and thirty-three. Of various calibre; from your\r\n      Chéniers, Gorsases, Camilles, down to your Marat, down now to\r\n      your incipient Hébert of the _Père Duchesne;_ these blow, with\r\n      fierce weight of argument or quick light banter, for the Rights\r\n      of man: Durosoys, Royous, Peltiers, Sulleaus, equally with mixed\r\n      tactics, inclusive, singular to say, of much profane Parody,[327]\r\n      are blowing for Altar and Throne. As for Marat the\r\n      People’s-Friend, his voice is as that of the bullfrog, or bittern\r\n      by the solitary pools; he, unseen of men, croaks harsh thunder,\r\n      and that alone continually,—of indignation, suspicion, incurable\r\n      sorrow. The People are sinking towards ruin, near starvation\r\n      itself: “My dear friends,” cries he, “your indigence is not the\r\n      fruit of vices nor of idleness, you have a right to life, as good\r\n      as Louis XVI., or the happiest of the century. What man can say\r\n      he has a right to dine, when you have no bread?”[328] The People\r\n      sinking on the one hand: on the other hand, nothing but wretched\r\n      Sieur Motiers, treasonous Riquetti Mirabeaus; traitors, or else\r\n      shadows, and simulacra of Quacks, to be seen in high places, look\r\n      where you will! Men that go mincing, grimacing, with plausible\r\n      speech and brushed raiment; hollow within: Quacks Political;\r\n      Quacks scientific, Academical; all with a fellow-feeling for each\r\n      other, and kind of Quack public-spirit! Not great Lavoisier\r\n      himself, or any of the Forty can escape this rough tongue; which\r\n      wants not fanatic sincerity, nor, strangest of all, a certain\r\n      rough caustic sense. And then the “three thousand gaming-houses”\r\n      that are in Paris; cesspools for the scoundrelism of the world;\r\n      sinks of iniquity and debauchery,—whereas without good morals\r\n      Liberty is impossible! There, in these Dens of Satan, which one\r\n      knows, and perseveringly denounces, do Sieur Motier’s mouchards\r\n      consort and colleague; battening vampyre-like on a People\r\n      next-door to starvation. “_O Peuple!_” cries he oftimes, with\r\n      heart-rending accent. Treason, delusion, vampyrism, scoundrelism,\r\n      from Dan to Beersheba! The soul of Marat is sick with the sight:\r\n      but what remedy? To erect “Eight Hundred gibbets,” in convenient\r\n      rows, and proceed to hoisting; “Riquetti on the first of them!”\r\n      Such is the brief recipe of Marat, Friend of the People.\r\n\r\n      So blow and bluster the Hundred and thirty-three: nor, as would\r\n      seem, are these sufficient; for there are benighted nooks in\r\n      France, to which Newspapers do not reach; and every where is\r\n      “such an appetite for news as was never seen in any country.” Let\r\n      an expeditious Dampmartin, on furlough, set out to return home\r\n      from Paris,[329] he cannot get along for “peasants stopping him\r\n      on the highway; overwhelming him with questions:” the _Maître de\r\n      Poste_ will not send out the horses till you have well nigh\r\n      quarrelled with him, but asks always, What news? At Autun, “in\r\n      spite of the rigorous frost” for it is now January, 1791, nothing\r\n      will serve but you must gather your wayworn limbs, and thoughts,\r\n      and “speak to the multitudes from a window opening into the\r\n      market-place.” It is the shortest method: _This_, good Christian\r\n      people, is verily what an August Assembly seemed to me to be\r\n      doing; this and no other is the news;\r\n\r\n     “Now my weary lips I close;\r\n     Leave me, leave me to repose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      The good Dampmartin!—But, on the whole, are not Nations\r\n      astonishingly true to their National character; which indeed runs\r\n      in the blood? Nineteen hundred years ago, Julius Cæsar, with his\r\n      quick sure eye, took note how the Gauls waylaid men. “It is a\r\n      habit of theirs,” says he, “to stop travellers, were it even by\r\n      constraint, and inquire whatsoever each of them may have heard or\r\n      known about any sort of matter: in their towns, the common people\r\n      beset the passing trader; demanding to hear from what regions he\r\n      came, what things he got acquainted with there. Excited by which\r\n      rumours and hearsays they will decide about the weightiest\r\n      matters; and necessarily repent next moment that they did it, on\r\n      such guidance of uncertain reports, and many a traveller\r\n      answering with mere fictions to please them, and get off.”[330]\r\n      Nineteen hundred years; and good Dampmartin, wayworn, in winter\r\n      frost, probably with scant light of stars and fish-oil, still\r\n      perorates from the Inn-window! This People is no longer called\r\n      Gaulish; and it has _wholly_ become _braccatus_, has got\r\n      breeches, and suffered change enough: certain fierce German\r\n      _Franken_ came storming over; and, so to speak, vaulted on the\r\n      back of it; and always after, in their grim tenacious way, have\r\n      ridden it bridled; for German is, by his very name, _Guerre_-man,\r\n      or man that _wars_ and _gars_. And so the People, as we say, is\r\n      now called French or Frankish: nevertheless, does not the old\r\n      Gaulish and Gaelic Celthood, with its vehemence, effervescent\r\n      promptitude, and what good and ill it had, still vindicate itself\r\n      little adulterated?—\r\n\r\n      For the rest, that in such prurient confusion, Clubbism thrives\r\n      and spreads, need not be said. Already the Mother of Patriotism,\r\n      sitting in the Jacobins, shines supreme over all; and has paled\r\n      the poor lunar light of that Monarchic Club near to final\r\n      extinction. She, we say, shines supreme, girt with sun-light, not\r\n      yet with infernal lightning; reverenced, not without fear, by\r\n      Municipal Authorities; counting her Barnaves, Lameths, Pétions,\r\n      of a National Assembly; most gladly of all, her Robespierre.\r\n      Cordeliers, again, your Hébert, Vincent, Bibliopolist Momoro,\r\n      groan audibly that a tyrannous Mayor and Sieur Motier harrow them\r\n      with the sharp _tribula_ of Law, intent apparently to suppress\r\n      them by tribulation. How the Jacobin Mother-Society, as hinted\r\n      formerly, sheds forth Cordeliers on this hand, and then Feuillans\r\n      on that; the Cordeliers on this hand, and then Feuillans on that;\r\n      the Cordeliers “an elixir or double-distillation of Jacobin\r\n      Patriotism;” the other a wide-spread weak dilution thereof; how\r\n      she will re-absorb the former into her Mother-bosom, and\r\n      stormfully dissipate the latter into Nonentity: how she breeds\r\n      and brings forth Three Hundred Daughter-Societies; her rearing of\r\n      them, her correspondence, her endeavourings and continual\r\n      travail: how, under an old figure, Jacobinism shoots forth\r\n      organic filaments to the utmost corners of confused dissolved\r\n      France; organising it anew:—this properly is the grand fact of\r\n      the Time.\r\n\r\n      To passionate Constitutionalism, still more to Royalism, which\r\n      see all their own Clubs fail and die, Clubbism will naturally\r\n      grow to seem the root of all evil. Nevertheless Clubbism is not\r\n      death, but rather new organisation, and life out of death:\r\n      destructive, indeed, of the remnants of the Old; but to the New\r\n      important, indispensable. That man can co-operate and hold\r\n      communion with man, herein lies his miraculous strength. In hut\r\n      or hamlet, Patriotism mourns not now like voice in the desert: it\r\n      can walk to the nearest Town; and there, in the Daughter-Society,\r\n      make its ejaculation into an articulate oration, into an action,\r\n      guided forward by the Mother of Patriotism herself. All Clubs of\r\n      Constitutionalists, and such like, fail, one after another, as\r\n      shallow fountains: Jacobinism alone has gone down to the deep\r\n      subterranean lake of waters; and may, unless _filled in_, flow\r\n      there, copious, continual, like an Artesian well. Till the Great\r\n      Deep have drained itself up: and all be flooded and submerged,\r\n      and Noah’s Deluge out-deluged!\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, Claude Fauchet, preparing mankind for a Golden\r\n      Age now apparently just at hand, has opened his _Cercle Social_,\r\n      with clerks, corresponding boards, and so forth; in the precincts\r\n      of the Palais Royal. It is _Te-Deum_ Fauchet; the same who\r\n      preached on Franklin’s Death, in that huge Medicean rotunda of\r\n      the _Halle aux bleds_. He here, this winter, by Printing-press\r\n      and melodious Colloquy, spreads bruit of himself to the utmost\r\n      City-barriers. “Ten thousand persons” of respectability attend\r\n      there; and listen to this “_Procureur-Général de la Vérité_,\r\n      Attorney-General of Truth,” so has he dubbed himself; to his sage\r\n      Condorcet, or other eloquent coadjutor. Eloquent\r\n      Attorney-General! He blows out from him, better or worse, what\r\n      crude or ripe thing he holds: not without result to himself; for\r\n      it leads to a Bishoprick, though only a Constitutional one.\r\n      Fauchet approves himself a glib-tongued, strong-lunged,\r\n      whole-hearted human individual: much flowing matter there is, and\r\n      really of the better sort, about Right, Nature, Benevolence,\r\n      Progress; which flowing matter, whether “it is pantheistic,” or\r\n      is pot-theistic, only the greener mind, in these days, need read.\r\n      Busy Brissot was long ago of purpose to establish precisely some\r\n      such regenerative _Social Circle:_ nay he had tried it, in\r\n      “Newman-street Oxford-street,” of the Fog Babylon; and failed,—as\r\n      some say, surreptitiously pocketing the cash. Fauchet, not\r\n      Brissot, was fated to be the happy man; whereat, however,\r\n      generous Brissot will with sincere heart sing a timber-toned\r\n      _Nunc Domine_.[331] But “ten thousand persons of respectability:”\r\n      what a bulk have many things in proportion to their magnitude!\r\n      This _Cercle Social_, for which Brissot chants in sincere\r\n      timber-tones such _Nunc Domine_, what is it? Unfortunately wind\r\n      and shadow. The main reality one finds in it now, is perhaps\r\n      this: that an “Attorney-General of Truth” did once take shape of\r\n      a body, as Son of Adam, on our Earth, though but for months or\r\n      moments; and ten thousand persons of respectability attended, ere\r\n      yet Chaos and Nox had reabsorbed him.\r\n\r\n      Hundred and thirty-three Paris Journals; regenerative Social\r\n      Circle; oratory, in Mother and Daughter Societies, from the\r\n      balconies of Inns, by chimney-nook, at dinner-table,—polemical,\r\n      ending many times in duel! Add ever, like a constant growling\r\n      accompaniment of bass Discord: scarcity of work, scarcity of\r\n      food. The winter is hard and cold; ragged Bakers’-queues, like a\r\n      black tattered flag-of-distress, wave out ever and anon. It is\r\n      the third of our Hunger-years this new year of a glorious\r\n      Revolution. The rich man when invited to dinner, in such\r\n      distress-seasons, feels bound in politeness to carry his own\r\n      bread in his pocket: how the poor dine? And your glorious\r\n      Revolution has done it, cries one. And our glorious Revolution is\r\n      subtilety, by black traitors worthy of the Lamp-iron, _perverted_\r\n      to do it, cries another! Who will paint the huge whirlpool\r\n      wherein France, all shivered into wild incoherence, whirls? The\r\n      jarring that went on under every French roof, in every French\r\n      heart; the diseased things that were spoken, done, the sum-total\r\n      whereof is the French Revolution, tongue of man cannot tell. Nor\r\n      the laws of action that work unseen in the depths of that huge\r\n      blind Incoherence! With amazement, not with measurement, men look\r\n      on the Immeasurable; not knowing its laws; _seeing_, with all\r\n      different degrees of knowledge, what new phases, and results of\r\n      event, its laws bring forth. France is as a monstrous Galvanic\r\n      Mass, wherein all sorts of far stranger than chemical galvanic or\r\n      electric forces and substances are at work; electrifying one\r\n      another, positive and negative; filling with electricity your\r\n      Leyden-jars,—Twenty-five millions in number! As the jars get\r\n      full, there will, from time to time, be, on slight hint, an\r\n      explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.III.\r\n      Sword in Hand.\r\n\r\n      On such wonderful basis, however, has Law, Royalty, Authority,\r\n      and whatever yet exists of visible Order, to maintain itself,\r\n      while it can. Here, as in that Commixture of the Four Elements\r\n      did the Anarch Old, has an august Assembly spread its pavilion;\r\n      curtained by the dark infinite of discords; founded on the\r\n      wavering bottomless of the Abyss; and keeps continual hubbub.\r\n      Time is around it, and Eternity, and the Inane; and it does what\r\n      it can, what is given it to do.\r\n\r\n      Glancing reluctantly in, once more, we discern little that is\r\n      edifying: a Constitutional Theory of Defective Verbs struggling\r\n      forward, with perseverance, amid endless interruptions: Mirabeau,\r\n      from his tribune, with the weight of his name and genius, awing\r\n      down much Jacobin violence; which in return vents itself the\r\n      louder over in its Jacobins Hall, and even reads him sharp\r\n      lectures there.[332] This man’s path is mysterious, questionable;\r\n      difficult, and he walks without companion in it. Pure Patriotism\r\n      does not now count him among her chosen; pure Royalism abhors\r\n      him: yet his weight with the world is overwhelming. Let him\r\n      travel on, companionless, unwavering, whither he is bound,—while\r\n      it is yet day with him, and the night has not come.\r\n\r\n      But the chosen band of pure Patriot brothers is small; counting\r\n      only some Thirty, seated now on the extreme tip of the Left,\r\n      separate from the world. A virtuous Pétion; an incorruptible\r\n      Robespierre, most consistent, incorruptible of thin acrid men;\r\n      Triumvirs Barnave, Duport, Lameth, great in speech, thought,\r\n      action, each according to his kind; a lean old Goupil de Prefeln:\r\n      on these and what will follow them has pure Patriotism to depend.\r\n\r\n      There too, conspicuous among the Thirty, if seldom audible,\r\n      Philippe d’Orléans may be seen sitting: in dim fuliginous\r\n      bewilderment; having, one might say, _arrived_ at Chaos! Gleams\r\n      there are, at once of a Lieutenancy and Regency; debates in the\r\n      Assembly itself, of succession to the Throne “in case the present\r\n      Branch should fail;” and Philippe, they say, walked anxiously, in\r\n      silence, through the corridors, till such high argument were\r\n      done: but it came all to nothing; Mirabeau, glaring into the man,\r\n      and through him, had to ejaculate in strong untranslatable\r\n      language: _Ce j—f—ne vaut pas la peine qu’on se donne pour lui_.\r\n      It came all to nothing; and in the meanwhile Philippe’s money,\r\n      they say, is gone! Could he refuse a little cash to the gifted\r\n      Patriot, in want only of that; he himself in want of all _but_\r\n      that? Not a pamphlet can be printed without cash; or indeed\r\n      written, without food purchasable by cash. Without cash your\r\n      hopefullest Projector cannot stir from the spot: individual\r\n      patriotic or other Projects require cash: how much more do\r\n      wide-spread Intrigues, which live and exist by cash; lying\r\n      widespread, with dragon-appetite for cash; fit to swallow\r\n      Princedoms! And so Prince Philippe, amid his Sillerys, Lacloses,\r\n      and confused Sons of Night, has rolled along: the centre of the\r\n      strangest cloudy coil; out of which has visibly come, as we often\r\n      say, an Epic Preternatural Machinery of SUSPICION; and _within_\r\n      which there has dwelt and worked,—what specialties of treason,\r\n      stratagem, aimed or aimless endeavour towards mischief, no party\r\n      living (if it be not the Presiding Genius of it, Prince of the\r\n      Power of the Air) has now any chance to know. Camille’s\r\n      conjecture is the likeliest: that poor Philippe did mount up, a\r\n      little way, in treasonable speculation, as he mounted formerly in\r\n      one of the earliest Balloons; but, frightened at the new position\r\n      he was getting into, had soon turned the cock again, and come\r\n      down. More fool than he rose! To create Preternatural Suspicion,\r\n      this was his function in the Revolutionary Epos. But now if he\r\n      have lost his cornucopia of ready-money, what else had he to\r\n      lose? In thick darkness, inward and outward, he must welter and\r\n      flounder on, in that piteous death-element, the hapless man.\r\n      Once, or even twice, we shall still behold him emerged;\r\n      struggling out of the thick death-element: in vain. For one\r\n      moment, it is the last moment, he starts aloft, or is flung\r\n      aloft, even into clearness and a kind of memorability,—to sink\r\n      then for evermore!\r\n\r\n      The _Côté Droit_ persists no less; nay with more animation than\r\n      ever, though hope has now well nigh fled. Tough Abbé Maury, when\r\n      the obscure country Royalist grasps his hand with transport of\r\n      thanks, answers, rolling his indomitable brazen head: ‘_Hélas,\r\n      Monsieur_, all that I do here is as good as simply _nothing_.’\r\n      Gallant Faussigny, visible this one time in History, advances\r\n      frantic, into the middle of the Hall, exclaiming: ‘There is but\r\n      one way of dealing with it, and that is to fall sword in hand on\r\n      those gentry there, _sabre à la main sur ces gaillards là_,’[333]\r\n      franticly indicating our chosen Thirty on the extreme tip of the\r\n      Left! Whereupon is clangour and clamour, debate,\r\n      repentance,—evaporation. Things ripen towards downright\r\n      incompatibility, and what is called “scission:” that fierce\r\n      theoretic onslaught of Faussigny’s was in August, 1790; next\r\n      August will not have come, till a famed Two Hundred and\r\n      Ninety-two, the chosen of Royalism, make solemn final “scission”\r\n      from an Assembly given up to faction; and depart, shaking the\r\n      dust off their feet.\r\n\r\n      Connected with this matter of sword in hand, there is yet another\r\n      thing to be noted. Of duels we have sometimes spoken: how, in all\r\n      parts of France, innumerable duels were fought; and argumentative\r\n      men and messmates, flinging down the wine-cup and weapons of\r\n      reason and repartee, met in the measured field; to part bleeding;\r\n      or perhaps _not_ to part, but to fall mutually skewered through\r\n      with iron, their wrath and life alike ending,—and die as fools\r\n      die. Long has this lasted, and still lasts. But now it would seem\r\n      as if in an august Assembly itself, traitorous Royalism, in its\r\n      despair, had taken to a new course: that of cutting off\r\n      Patriotism by systematic duel! Bully-swordsmen, “_Spadassins_” of\r\n      that party, go swaggering; or indeed they can be had for a trifle\r\n      of money. “Twelve _Spadassins_” were _seen_, by the yellow eye of\r\n      Journalism, “arriving recently out of Switzerland;” also “a\r\n      considerable number of Assassins, _nombre considérable\r\n      d’assassins_, exercising in fencing-schools and at\r\n      pistol-targets.” Any Patriot Deputy of mark can be called out;\r\n      let him escape one time, or ten times, a time there necessarily\r\n      is when he must fall, and France mourn. How many cartels has\r\n      Mirabeau had; especially while he was the People’s champion!\r\n      Cartels by the hundred: which he, since the Constitution must be\r\n      made first, and his time is precious, answers now always with a\r\n      kind of stereotype formula: ‘Monsieur, you are put upon my List;\r\n      but I warn you that it is long, and I grant no preferences.’\r\n\r\n      Then, in Autumn, had we not the Duel of Cazalès and Barnave; the\r\n      two chief masters of tongue-shot meeting now to exchange\r\n      pistol-shot? For Cazalès, chief of the Royalists, whom we call\r\n      “Blacks or _Noirs_,” said, in a moment of passion, ‘the Patriots\r\n      were sheer Brigands,’ nay in so speaking, he darted or seemed to\r\n      dart, a fire-glance specially at Barnave; who thereupon could not\r\n      but reply by fire-glances,—by adjournment to the\r\n      Bois-de-Boulogne. Barnave’s second shot took effect: on Cazalès’s\r\n      _hat_. The “front nook” of a triangular Felt, such as mortals\r\n      then wore, deadened the ball; and saved that fine brow from more\r\n      than temporary injury. But how easily might the lot have fallen\r\n      the other way, and Barnave’s hat not been so good! Patriotism\r\n      raises its loud denunciation of Duelling in general; petitions an\r\n      august Assembly to stop such Feudal barbarism by law. Barbarism\r\n      and solecism: for will it convince or convict any man to blow\r\n      half an ounce of lead through the head of him? Surely\r\n      not.—Barnave was received at the Jacobins with embraces, yet with\r\n      rebukes.\r\n\r\n      Mindful of which, and also that his repetition in America was\r\n      that of headlong foolhardiness rather, and want of brain not of\r\n      heart, Charles Lameth does, on the eleventh day of November, with\r\n      little emotion, decline attending some hot young Gentleman from\r\n      Artois, come expressly to challenge him: nay indeed he first\r\n      coldly engages to attend; then coldly permits two Friends to\r\n      attend instead of him, and shame the young Gentleman out of it,\r\n      which they successfully do. A cold procedure; satisfactory to the\r\n      two Friends, to Lameth and the hot young Gentleman; whereby, one\r\n      might have fancied, the whole matter was cooled down.\r\n\r\n      Not so, however: Lameth, proceeding to his senatorial duties, in\r\n      the decline of the day, is met in those Assembly corridors by\r\n      nothing but Royalist _brocards;_ sniffs, huffs, and open insults.\r\n      Human patience has its limits: ‘Monsieur,’ said Lameth, breaking\r\n      silence to one Lautrec, a man with hunchback, or natural\r\n      deformity, but sharp of tongue, and a _Black_ of the deepest\r\n      tint, ‘Monsieur, if you were a man to be fought with!’—‘I am\r\n      one,’ cries the young Duke de Castries. Fast as fire-flash Lameth\r\n      replies, ‘_Tout à l’heure_, On the instant, then!’ And so, as the\r\n      shades of dusk thicken in that Bois-de-Boulogne, we behold two\r\n      men with lion-look, with alert attitude, side foremost, right\r\n      foot advanced; flourishing and thrusting, stoccado and passado,\r\n      in tierce and quart; intent to skewer one another. See, with most\r\n      skewering purpose, headlong Lameth, with his whole weight, makes\r\n      a furious lunge; but deft Castries whisks aside: Lameth skewers\r\n      only the air,—and slits deep and far, on Castries’ sword’s-point,\r\n      his own extended left arm! Whereupon with bleeding, pallor,\r\n      surgeon’s-lint, and formalities, the Duel is considered\r\n      satisfactorily done.\r\n\r\n      But will there be no end, then? Beloved Lameth lies deep-slit,\r\n      not out of danger. Black traitorous Aristocrats kill the People’s\r\n      defenders, cut up not with arguments, but with rapier-slits. And\r\n      the Twelve _Spadassins_ out of Switzerland, and the considerable\r\n      number of Assassins exercising at the pistol-target? So meditates\r\n      and ejaculates hurt Patriotism, with ever-deepening ever-widening\r\n      fervour, for the space of six and thirty hours.\r\n\r\n      The thirty-six hours past, on Saturday the 13th, one beholds a\r\n      new spectacle: The Rue de Varennes, and neighbouring Boulevard\r\n      des Invalides, covered with a mixed flowing multitude: the\r\n      Castries Hotel gone distracted, devil-ridden, belching from every\r\n      window, “beds with clothes and curtains,” plate of silver and\r\n      gold with filigree, mirrors, pictures, images, commodes,\r\n      chiffoniers, and endless crockery and jingle: amid steady popular\r\n      cheers, absolutely without theft; for there goes a cry, ‘He shall\r\n      be hanged that steals a nail!’ It is a _Plebiscitum_, or informal\r\n      iconoclastic Decree of the Common People, in the course of being\r\n      executed!—The Municipality sit tremulous; deliberating whether\r\n      they will hang out the _Drapeau Rouge_ and Martial Law: National\r\n      Assembly, part in loud wail, part in hardly suppressed applause:\r\n      Abbé Maury unable to decide whether the iconoclastic Plebs amount\r\n      to forty thousand or to two hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n      Deputations, swift messengers, for it is at a distance over the\r\n      River, come and go. Lafayette and National Guardes, though\r\n      without _Drapeau Rouge_, get under way; apparently in no hot\r\n      haste. Nay, arrived on the scene, Lafayette salutes with doffed\r\n      hat, before ordering to fix bayonets. What avails it? The\r\n      Plebeian ‘Court of _Cassation_,’ as Camille might punningly name\r\n      it, has done its work; steps forth, with unbuttoned vest, with\r\n      pockets turned inside out: sack, and just ravage, not plunder!\r\n      With inexhaustible patience, the Hero of two Worlds remonstrates;\r\n      persuasively, with a kind of sweet constraint, though also with\r\n      fixed bayonets, dissipates, hushes down: on the morrow it is once\r\n      more all as usual.\r\n\r\n      Considering which things, however, Duke Castries may justly\r\n      “write to the President,” justly transport himself across the\r\n      Marches; to raise a corps, or do what else is in him. Royalism\r\n      totally abandons that Bobadilian method of contest, and the\r\n      Twelve _Spadassins_ return to Switzerland,—or even to Dreamland\r\n      through the Horn-gate, whichsoever their home is. Nay Editor\r\n      Prudhomme is authorised to publish a curious thing: “We are\r\n      authorised to publish,” says he, dull-blustering Publisher, that\r\n      M. Boyer, champion of good Patriots, is at the head of Fifty\r\n      _Spadassinicides_ or Bully-_killers_. His address is: Passage du\r\n      Bois-de-Boulonge, Faubourg St. Denis.”[334] One of the strangest\r\n      Institutes, this of Champion Boyer and the Bully-killers! Whose\r\n      services, however, are not wanted; Royalism having abandoned the\r\n      rapier-method as plainly impracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.IV.\r\n      To fly or not to fly.\r\n\r\n      The truth is Royalism sees itself verging towards sad\r\n      extremities; nearer and nearer daily. From over the Rhine it\r\n      comes asserted that the King in his Tuileries is not free: this\r\n      the poor King may contradict, with the official mouth, but in his\r\n      heart feels often to be undeniable. Civil Constitution of the\r\n      Clergy; Decree of ejectment against Dissidents from it: not even\r\n      to this latter, though almost his conscience rebels, can he say\r\n      “Nay; but, after two months’ hesitating, signs this also. It was\r\n      on January 21st,” of this 1790, that he signed it; to the sorrow\r\n      of his poor/ heart yet, on _another_ Twenty-first of January!\r\n      Whereby come Dissident ejected Priests; unconquerable Martyrs\r\n      according to some, incurable chicaning Traitors according to\r\n      others. And so there has arrived what we once foreshadowed: with\r\n      Religion, or with the Cant and Echo of Religion, all France is\r\n      rent asunder in a new rupture of continuity; complicating,\r\n      embittering all the older;—to be cured only, by stern surgery, in\r\n      La Vendée!\r\n\r\n      Unhappy Royalty, unhappy Majesty, Hereditary (Representative),\r\n      _Représentant Héréditaire_, or however they can name him; of whom\r\n      much is expected, to whom little is given! Blue National Guards\r\n      encircle that Tuileries; a Lafayette, thin constitutional Pedant;\r\n      clear, thin, inflexible, as water, turned to thin ice; whom no\r\n      Queen’s heart can love. National Assembly, its pavilion spread\r\n      where we know, sits near by, keeping continual hubbub. From\r\n      without nothing but Nanci Revolts, sack of Castries Hotels, riots\r\n      and seditions; riots, North and South, at Aix, at Douai, at\r\n      Béfort, Usez, Perpignan, at Nismes, and that incurable Avignon of\r\n      the Pope’s: a continual crackling and sputtering of riots from\r\n      the whole face of France;—testifying how electric it grows. Add\r\n      only the hard winter, the famished _strikes_ of operatives; that\r\n      continual running-bass of Scarcity, ground-tone and basis of all\r\n      other Discords!\r\n\r\n      The plan of Royalty, so far as it can be said to have any fixed\r\n      plan, is still, as ever, that of flying towards the frontiers. In\r\n      very truth, the only plan of the smallest promise for it! Fly to\r\n      Bouillé; bristle yourself round with cannon, served by your\r\n      “forty-thousand undebauched Germans:” summon the National\r\n      Assembly to follow you, summon what of it is Royalist,\r\n      Constitutional, gainable by money; dissolve the rest, by\r\n      grapeshot if need be. Let Jacobinism and Revolt, with one wild\r\n      wail, fly into Infinite Space; driven by grapeshot. Thunder over\r\n      France with the cannon’s mouth; commanding, not entreating, that\r\n      this riot cease. And then to rule afterwards with utmost possible\r\n      Constitutionality; doing justice, loving mercy; _being_ Shepherd\r\n      of this indigent People, not Shearer merely, and\r\n      Shepherd’s-similitude! All this, if ye dare. If ye dare not, then\r\n      in Heaven’s name go to sleep: other handsome alternative seems\r\n      none.\r\n\r\n      Nay, it were perhaps possible; with a man to do it. For if such\r\n      inexpressible whirlpool of Babylonish confusions (which our Era\r\n      is) cannot be stilled by man, but only by Time and men, a man may\r\n      moderate its paroxysms, may balance and sway, and keep himself\r\n      unswallowed on the top of it,—as several men and Kings in these\r\n      days do. Much is possible for a man; men will obey a man that\r\n      _kens_ and _cans_, and name him reverently their _Ken-ning_ or\r\n      King. Did not Charlemagne rule? Consider too whether he had\r\n      smooth times of it; hanging “thirty-thousand Saxons over the\r\n      Weser-Bridge,” at one dread swoop! So likewise, who knows but, in\r\n      this same distracted fanatic France, the right man may verily\r\n      exist? An olive-complexioned taciturn man; for the present,\r\n      Lieutenant in the Artillery-service, who once sat studying\r\n      Mathematics at Brienne? The same who walked in the morning to\r\n      correct proof-sheets at Dôle, and enjoyed a frugal breakfast with\r\n      M. Joly? Such a one is gone, whither also famed General Paoli his\r\n      friend is gone, in these very days, to see old scenes in native\r\n      Corsica, and what Democratic good can be done there.\r\n\r\n      Royalty never executes the evasion-plan, yet never abandons it;\r\n      living in variable hope; undecisive, till fortune shall decide.\r\n      In utmost secrecy, a brisk Correspondence goes on with Bouillé;\r\n      there is also a plot, which emerges more than once, for carrying\r\n      the King to Rouen:[335] plot after plot, emerging and submerging,\r\n      like “_ignes fatui_ in foul weather, which lead no whither. About\r\n      “ten o’clock at night,” the Hereditary Representative, in _partie\r\n      quarrée_, with the Queen, with Brother Monsieur, and Madame, sits\r\n      playing “_wisk_,” or whist. Usher Campan enters mysteriously,\r\n      with a message he only half comprehends: How a certain Compte\r\n      d’Inisdal waits anxious in the outer antechamber; National\r\n      Colonel, Captain of the watch for this night, is gained over;\r\n      post-horses ready all the way; party of Noblesse sitting armed,\r\n      determined; will His Majesty, before midnight, consent to go?\r\n      Profound silence; Campan waiting with upturned ear. ‘Did your\r\n      Majesty hear what Campan said?’ asks the Queen. ‘Yes, I heard,’\r\n      answers Majesty, and plays on. ‘’Twas a pretty couplet, that of\r\n      Campan’s,’ hints Monsieur, who at times showed a pleasant wit:\r\n      Majesty, still unresponsive, plays wisk. ‘After all, one must say\r\n      something to Campan,’ remarks the Queen. ‘Tell M. d’Inisdal,’\r\n      said the King, and the Queen puts an emphasis on it, ‘that the\r\n      King cannot _consent_ to be forced away.’—‘I see!’ said\r\n      d’Inisdal, whisking round, peaking himself into flame of\r\n      irritancy: ‘we have the risk; we are to have all the blame if it\r\n      fail,’[336]—and vanishes, he and his plot, as will-o’-wisps do.\r\n      The Queen sat till far in the night, packing jewels: but it came\r\n      to nothing; in that peaked frame of irritancy the Will-o’-wisp\r\n      had gone _out_.\r\n\r\n      Little hope there is in all this. Alas, with whom to fly? Our\r\n      loyal _Gardes-du-Corps_, ever since the Insurrection of Women,\r\n      are disbanded; gone to their homes; gone, many of them, across\r\n      the Rhine towards Coblentz and Exiled Princes: brave Miomandre\r\n      and brave Tardivet, these faithful Two, have received, in\r\n      nocturnal interview with both Majesties, their _viaticum_ of gold\r\n      louis, of heartfelt thanks from a Queen’s lips, though unluckily\r\n      “his Majesty stood, back to fire, not speaking;”[337] and do now\r\n      dine through the Provinces; recounting hairsbreadth escapes,\r\n      insurrectionary horrors. Great horrors; to be swallowed yet of\r\n      greater. But on the whole what a falling off from the old\r\n      splendour of Versailles! Here in this poor Tuileries, a National\r\n      Brewer-Colonel, sonorous Santerre, parades officially behind her\r\n      Majesty’s chair. Our high dignitaries, all fled over the Rhine:\r\n      nothing now to be gained at Court; but hopes, for which life\r\n      itself must be risked! Obscure busy men frequent the back stairs;\r\n      with hearsays, wind projects, unfruitful fanfaronades. Young\r\n      Royalists, at the _Théâtre de Vaudeville_, “sing couplets;” if\r\n      that could do any thing. Royalists enough, Captains on furlough,\r\n      burnt-out Seigneurs, may likewise be met with, “in the Café de\r\n      Valois, and at Méot the Restaurateur’s.” There they fan one\r\n      another into high loyal glow; drink, in such wine as can be\r\n      procured, confusion to Sansculottism; shew purchased dirks, of an\r\n      improved structure, made to order; and, greatly daring,\r\n      dine.[338] It is in these places, in these months, that the\r\n      epithet _Sansculotte_ first gets applied to indigent Patriotism;\r\n      in the last age we had Gilbert _Sansculotte_, the indigent\r\n      Poet.[339] Destitute-of-Breeches: a mournful Destitution; which\r\n      however, if Twenty millions share it, may become more effective\r\n      than most Possessions!\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, amid this vague dim whirl of fanfaronades,\r\n      wind-projects, poniards made to order, there does disclose itself\r\n      one _punctum-saliens_ of life and feasibility: the finger of\r\n      Mirabeau! Mirabeau and the Queen of France have met; have parted\r\n      with mutual trust! It is strange; secret as the Mysteries; but it\r\n      is indubitable. Mirabeau took horse, one evening; and rode\r\n      westward, unattended,—to see Friend Clavière in that country\r\n      house of his? Before getting to Clavière’s, the much-musing\r\n      horseman struck aside to a back gate of the Garden of\r\n      Saint-Cloud: some Duke d’Aremberg, or the like, was there to\r\n      introduce him; the Queen was not far: on a “round knoll, _rond\r\n      point_, the highest of the Garden of Saint-Cloud,” he beheld the\r\n      Queen’s face; spake with her, alone, under the void canopy of\r\n      Night. What an interview; fateful secret for us, after all\r\n      searching; like the colloquies of the gods![340] She called him\r\n      “a Mirabeau:” elsewhere we read that she “was charmed with him,”\r\n      the wild submitted Titan; as indeed it is among the honourable\r\n      tokens of this high ill-fated heart that no mind of any\r\n      endowment, no Mirabeau, nay no Barnave, no Dumouriez, ever came\r\n      face to face with her but, in spite of all prepossessions, she\r\n      was forced to recognise it, to draw nigh to it, with trust. High\r\n      imperial heart; with the instinctive attraction towards all that\r\n      had any height! ‘You know not the Queen,’ said Mirabeau once in\r\n      confidence; ‘her force of mind is prodigious; she is a man for\r\n      courage.’[341]—And so, under the void Night, on the crown of that\r\n      knoll, she has spoken with a Mirabeau: he has kissed loyally the\r\n      queenly hand, and said with enthusiasm: ‘Madame, the Monarchy is\r\n      saved!’—Possible? The Foreign Powers, mysteriously sounded, gave\r\n      favourable guarded response;[342] Bouillé is at Metz, and could\r\n      find forty-thousand sure Germans. With a Mirabeau for head, and a\r\n      Bouillé for hand, something verily is possible,—if Fate intervene\r\n      not.\r\n\r\n      But figure under what thousandfold wrappages, and cloaks of\r\n      darkness, Royalty, meditating these things, must involve itself.\r\n      There are men with “Tickets of Entrance;” there are chivalrous\r\n      consultings, mysterious plottings. Consider also whether, involve\r\n      as it like, plotting Royalty can escape the glance of Patriotism;\r\n      lynx-eyes, by the ten thousand fixed on it, which see in the\r\n      dark! Patriotism knows much: know the dirks made to order, and\r\n      can specify the shops; knows Sieur Motier’s legions of mouchards;\r\n      the Tickets of _Entrée_, and men in black; and how plan of\r\n      evasion succeeds plan,—or may be supposed to succeed it. Then\r\n      conceive the couplets chanted at the _Théâtre de Vaudeville;_ or\r\n      worse, the whispers, significant nods of traitors in moustaches.\r\n      Conceive, on the other hand, the loud cry of alarm that came\r\n      through the Hundred-and-Thirty Journals; the Dionysius’-Ear of\r\n      each of the Forty-eight Sections, wakeful night and day.\r\n\r\n      Patriotism is patient of much; not patient of all. The _Café de\r\n      Procope_ has sent, visibly along the streets, a Deputation of\r\n      Patriots, “to expostulate with bad Editors,” by trustful word of\r\n      mouth: singular to see and hear. The bad Editors promise to\r\n      amend, but do not. Deputations for change of Ministry were many;\r\n      Mayor Bailly joining even with Cordelier Danton in such: and they\r\n      have prevailed. With what profit? Of Quacks, willing or\r\n      constrained to be Quacks, the race is everlasting: Ministers\r\n      Duportail and Dutertre will have to manage much as Ministers\r\n      Latour-du-Pin and Cicé did. So welters the confused world.\r\n\r\n      But now, beaten on for ever by such inextricable contradictory\r\n      influences and evidences, what is the indigent French Patriot, in\r\n      these unhappy days, to believe, and walk by? Uncertainty all;\r\n      except that he is wretched, indigent; that a glorious Revolution,\r\n      the wonder of the Universe, has hitherto brought neither Bread\r\n      nor Peace; being marred by traitors, difficult to discover.\r\n      Traitors that dwell in the dark, invisible there;—or seen for\r\n      moments, in pallid dubious twilight, stealthily vanishing\r\n      thither! Preternatural Suspicion once more rules the minds of\r\n      men.\r\n\r\n      “Nobody here,” writes Carra of the _Annales Patriotiques_, so\r\n      early as the first of February, “can entertain a doubt of the\r\n      constant obstinate project these people have on foot to get the\r\n      King away; or of the perpetual succession of manœuvres they\r\n      employ for that.” Nobody: the watchful Mother of Patriotism\r\n      deputed two Members to her Daughter at Versailles, to examine how\r\n      the matter looked there. Well, and there? Patriotic Carra\r\n      continues: “The Report of these two deputies we all heard with\r\n      our own ears last Saturday. They went with others of Versailles,\r\n      to inspect the King’s Stables, also the stables of the whilom\r\n      _Gardes du Corps;_ they found there from seven to eight hundred\r\n      horses standing always saddled and bridled, ready for the road at\r\n      a moment’s notice. The same deputies, moreover, saw with their\r\n      own two eyes several Royal Carriages, which men were even then\r\n      busy loading with large well-stuffed luggage-bags,” leather cows,\r\n      as we call them, “_vaches de cuir;_ the Royal Arms on the panels\r\n      almost entirely effaced.” Momentous enough! Also, “on the same\r\n      day the whole _Maréchaussée_, or Cavalry Police, did assemble\r\n      with arms, horses and baggage,”—and disperse again. They want the\r\n      King over the marches, that so Emperor Leopold and the German\r\n      Princes, whose troops are ready, may have a pretext for\r\n      beginning: “this,” adds Carra, “is the word of the riddle: this\r\n      is the reason why our fugitive Aristocrats are now making levies\r\n      of men on the frontiers; expecting that, one of these mornings,\r\n      the Executive Chief Magistrate will be brought over to them, and\r\n      the civil war commence.”[343]\r\n\r\n      If indeed the Executive Chief Magistrate, bagged, say in one of\r\n      these leather _cows_, were once brought safe over to them! But\r\n      the strangest thing of all is that Patriotism, whether barking at\r\n      a venture, or guided by some instinct of preternatural sagacity,\r\n      is actually barking _aright_ this time; at something, not at\r\n      nothing. Bouillé’s Secret Correspondence, since made public,\r\n      testifies as much.\r\n\r\n      Nay, it is undeniable, visible to all, that _Mesdames_ the King’s\r\n      Aunts are taking steps for departure: asking passports of the\r\n      Ministry, safe-conducts of the Municipality; which Marat warns\r\n      all men to beware of. They will carry gold with them, “these old\r\n      _Béguines;_” nay they will carry the little Dauphin, “having\r\n      nursed a changeling, for some time, to leave in his stead!”\r\n      Besides, they are as some light substance flung up, to shew how\r\n      the wind sits; a kind of proof-kite you fly off to ascertain\r\n      whether the grand paper-kite, Evasion of the King, may mount!\r\n\r\n      In these alarming circumstances, Patriotism is not wanting to\r\n      itself. Municipality deputes to the King; Sections depute to the\r\n      Municipality; a National Assembly will soon stir. Meanwhile,\r\n      behold, on the 19th of February 1791, Mesdames, quitting Bellevue\r\n      and Versailles with all privacy, are off! Towards Rome,\r\n      seemingly; or one knows not whither. They are not without King’s\r\n      passports, countersigned; and what is more to the purpose, a\r\n      serviceable Escort. The Patriotic Mayor or Mayorlet of the\r\n      Village of Moret tried to detain them; but brisk Louis de\r\n      Narbonne, of the Escort, dashed off at hand-gallop; returned soon\r\n      with thirty dragoons, and victoriously cut them out. And so the\r\n      poor ancient women go their way; to the terror of France and\r\n      Paris, whose nervous excitability is become extreme. Who else\r\n      would hinder poor _Loque_ and _Graille_, now grown so old, and\r\n      fallen into such unexpected circumstances, when gossip itself\r\n      turning only on terrors and horrors is no longer pleasant to the\r\n      mind, and you cannot get so much as an orthodox confessor in\r\n      peace,—from going what way soever the hope of any solacement\r\n      might lead them?\r\n\r\n      They go, poor ancient dames,—whom the heart were hard that does\r\n      not pity: they go; with palpitations, with unmelodious suppressed\r\n      screechings; all France, screeching and cackling, in loud\r\n      _un_suppressed terror, behind and on both hands of them: such\r\n      mutual suspicion is among men. At Arnay le Duc, above halfway to\r\n      the frontiers, a Patriotic Municipality and Populace again takes\r\n      courage to stop them: Louis Narbonne must now back to Paris, must\r\n      consult the National Assembly. National Assembly answers, not\r\n      without an effort, that Mesdames may go. Whereupon Paris rises\r\n      worse than ever, screeching half-distracted. Tuileries and\r\n      precincts are filled with women and men, while the National\r\n      Assembly debates this question of questions; Lafayette is needed\r\n      at night for dispersing them, and the streets are to be\r\n      illuminated. Commandant Berthier, a Berthier before whom are\r\n      great things unknown, lies for the present under blockade at\r\n      Bellevue in Versailles. By no tactics could he get Mesdames’\r\n      Luggage stirred from the Courts there; frantic Versaillese women\r\n      came screaming about him; his very troops cut the waggon-traces;\r\n      he retired to the interior, waiting better times.[344]\r\n\r\n      Nay, in these same hours, while Mesdames hardly cut out from\r\n      Moret by the sabre’s edge, are driving rapidly, to foreign parts,\r\n      and not yet stopped at Arnay, their august nephew poor Monsieur,\r\n      at Paris has dived deep into his cellars of the Luxembourg for\r\n      shelter; and according to Montgaillard can hardly be persuaded up\r\n      again. Screeching multitudes environ that Luxembourg of his:\r\n      drawn thither by report of his departure: but, at sight and sound\r\n      of Monsieur, they become crowing multitudes; and escort Madame\r\n      and him to the Tuileries with vivats.[345] It is a state of\r\n      nervous excitability such as few Nations know.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.V.\r\n      The Day of Poniards.\r\n\r\n      Or, again, what means this visible reparation of the Castle of\r\n      Vincennes? Other Jails being all crowded with prisoners, new\r\n      space is wanted here: that is the Municipal account. For in such\r\n      changing of Judicatures, Parlements being abolished, and New\r\n      Courts but just set up, prisoners have accumulated. Not to say\r\n      that in these times of discord and club-law, offences and\r\n      committals are, at any rate, more numerous. Which Municipal\r\n      account, does it not sufficiently explain the phenomenon? Surely,\r\n      to repair the Castle of Vincennes was of all enterprises that an\r\n      enlightened Municipality could undertake, the most innocent.\r\n\r\n      Not so however does neighbouring Saint-Antoine look on it:\r\n      Saint-Antoine to whom these peaked turrets and grim donjons,\r\n      all-too near her own dark dwelling, are of themselves an offence.\r\n      Was not Vincennes a kind of minor Bastille? Great Diderot and\r\n      Philosophes have lain in durance here; great Mirabeau, in\r\n      disastrous eclipse, for forty-two months. And now when the old\r\n      Bastille has become a dancing-ground (had any one the mirth to\r\n      dance), and its stones are getting built into the Pont\r\n      Louis-Seize, does this minor, comparative insignificance of a\r\n      Bastille flank itself with fresh-hewn mullions, spread out\r\n      tyrannous wings; menacing Patriotism? New space for prisoners:\r\n      and what prisoners? A d’Orléans, with the chief Patriots on the\r\n      tip of the Left? It is said, there runs “a subterranean passage”\r\n      all the way from the Tuileries hither. Who knows? Paris, mined\r\n      with quarries and catacombs, does hang wondrous over the abyss;\r\n      Paris was once to be blown up,—though the powder, when we went to\r\n      look, had got withdrawn. A Tuileries, sold to Austria and\r\n      Coblentz, should have no subterranean passage. Out of which might\r\n      not Coblentz or Austria issue, some morning; and, with cannon of\r\n      long range, “_foudroyer_,” bethunder a patriotic Saint-Antoine\r\n      into smoulder and ruin!\r\n\r\n      So meditates the benighted soul of Saint-Antoine, as it sees the\r\n      aproned workmen, in early spring, busy on these towers. An\r\n      official-speaking Municipality, a Sieur Motier with his legions\r\n      of _mouchards_, deserve no trust at all. Were Patriot Santerre,\r\n      indeed, Commander! But the sonorous Brewer commands only our own\r\n      Battalion: of such secrets he can explain nothing, knows nothing,\r\n      perhaps suspects much. And so the work goes on; and afflicted\r\n      benighted Saint-Antoine hears rattle of hammers, sees stones\r\n      suspended in air.[346]\r\n\r\n      Saint-Antoine prostrated the first great Bastille: will it falter\r\n      over this comparative insignificance of a Bastille? Friends, what\r\n      if we took pikes, firelocks, sledgehammers; and helped\r\n      ourselves!—Speedier is no remedy; nor so certain. On the 28th day\r\n      of February, Saint-Antoine turns out, as it has now often done;\r\n      and, apparently with little superfluous tumult, moves eastward to\r\n      that eye-sorrow of Vincennes. With grave voice of authority, no\r\n      need of bullying and shouting, Saint-Antoine signifies to parties\r\n      concerned there that its purpose is, To have this suspicious\r\n      Stronghold razed level with the general soil of the country.\r\n      Remonstrance may be proffered, with zeal: but it avails not. The\r\n      outer gate goes up, drawbridges tumble; iron window-stanchions,\r\n      smitten out with sledgehammers, become iron-crowbars: it rains\r\n      furniture, stone-masses, slates: with chaotic clatter and rattle,\r\n      Demolition clatters down. And now hasty expresses rush through\r\n      the agitated streets, to warn Lafayette, and the Municipal and\r\n      Departmental Authorities; Rumour warns a National Assembly, a\r\n      Royal Tuileries, and all men who care to hear it: That\r\n      Saint-Antoine is up; that Vincennes, and probably the last\r\n      remaining Institution of the Country, is coming down.[347]\r\n\r\n      Quick, then! Let Lafayette roll his drums and fly eastward; for\r\n      to all Constitutional Patriots this is again bad news. And you,\r\n      ye Friends of Royalty, snatch your poniards of improved\r\n      structure, made to order; your sword-canes, secret arms, and\r\n      tickets of entry; quick, by backstairs passages, rally round the\r\n      Son of Sixty Kings. An effervescence probably got up by d’Orléans\r\n      and Company, for the overthrow of Throne and Altar: it is said\r\n      her Majesty shall be put in prison, put out of the way; what then\r\n      will _his_ Majesty be? Clay for the Sansculottic Potter! Or were\r\n      it impossible to fly this day; a brave Noblesse suddenly all\r\n      rallying? Peril threatens, hope invites: Dukes de Villequier, de\r\n      Duras, Gentlemen of the Chamber give tickets and admittance; a\r\n      brave Noblesse is suddenly all rallying. Now were the time to\r\n      “fall sword in hand on those gentry there,” could it be done with\r\n      effect.\r\n\r\n      The Hero of two Worlds is on his white charger; blue Nationals,\r\n      horse and foot, hurrying eastward: Santerre, with the\r\n      Saint-Antoine Battalion, is already there,—apparently indisposed\r\n      to act. Heavy-laden Hero of two Worlds, what tasks are these! The\r\n      jeerings, provocative gambollings of that Patriot Suburb, which\r\n      is all out on the streets now, are hard to endure; unwashed\r\n      Patriots jeering in sulky sport; one unwashed Patriot “seizing\r\n      the General by the boot” to unhorse him. Santerre, ordered to\r\n      fire, makes answer obliquely, ‘These are the men that took the\r\n      Bastille;’ and not a trigger stirs! Neither dare the Vincennes\r\n      Magistracy give warrant of arrestment, or the smallest\r\n      countenance: wherefore the General “will take it on himself” to\r\n      arrest. By promptitude, by cheerful adroitness, patience and\r\n      brisk valour without limits, the riot may be again bloodlessly\r\n      appeased.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, the rest of Paris, with more or less unconcern, may\r\n      mind the rest of its business: for what is this but an\r\n      effervescence, of which there are now so many? The National\r\n      Assembly, in one of its stormiest moods, is debating a Law\r\n      against Emigration; Mirabeau declaring aloud, ‘I swear beforehand\r\n      that I will not obey it.’ Mirabeau is often at the Tribune this\r\n      day; with endless impediments from without; with the old unabated\r\n      energy from within. What can murmurs and clamours, from Left or\r\n      from Right, do to this man; like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved?\r\n      With clear thought; with strong bass-voice, though at first low,\r\n      uncertain, he claims audience, sways the storm of men: anon the\r\n      sound of him waxes, softens; he rises into far-sounding melody of\r\n      strength, triumphant, which subdues all hearts; his rude-seamed\r\n      face, desolate fire-scathed, becomes fire-lit, and radiates: once\r\n      again men feel, in these beggarly ages, what is the potency and\r\n      omnipotency of man’s word on the souls of men. ‘I will triumph or\r\n      be torn in fragments,’ he was once heard to say. ‘Silence,’ he\r\n      cries now, in strong word of command, in imperial consciousness\r\n      of strength, ‘Silence, the thirty voices, _Silence aux trente\r\n      voix!_’—and Robespierre and the Thirty Voices die into\r\n      mutterings; and the Law is once more as Mirabeau would have it.\r\n\r\n      How different, at the same instant, is General Lafayette’s street\r\n      eloquence; wrangling with sonorous Brewers, with an ungrammatical\r\n      Saint-Antoine! Most different, again, from both is the\r\n      Café-de-Valois eloquence, and suppressed fanfaronade, of this\r\n      multitude of men with Tickets of Entry; who are now inundating\r\n      the Corridors of the Tuileries. Such things can go on\r\n      simultaneously in one City. How much more in one Country; in one\r\n      Planet with its discrepancies, every Day a mere crackling\r\n      infinitude of discrepancies—which nevertheless do yield some\r\n      coherent net-product, though an infinitesimally small one!\r\n\r\n      Be this as it may. Lafayette has saved Vincennes; and is marching\r\n      homewards with some dozen of arrested demolitionists. Royalty is\r\n      not yet saved;—nor indeed specially endangered. But to the King’s\r\n      Constitutional Guard, to these old Gardes Françaises, or Centre\r\n      Grenadiers, as it chanced to be, this affluence of men with\r\n      Tickets of Entry is becoming more and more unintelligible. Is his\r\n      Majesty verily for Metz, then; to be carried off by these men, on\r\n      the spur of the instant? That revolt of Saint-Antoine got up by\r\n      traitor Royalists for a stalking-horse? Keep a sharp outlook, ye\r\n      Centre Grenadiers on duty here: good never came from the “men in\r\n      black.” Nay they have cloaks, _rédingotes;_ some of them\r\n      leather-breeches, boots,—as if for instant riding! Or what is\r\n      this that sticks visible from the lapelle of Chevalier de\r\n      Court?[348] Too like the handle of some cutting or stabbing\r\n      instrument! He glides and goes; and still the dudgeon sticks from\r\n      his left lapelle. ‘Hold, Monsieur!’—a Centre Grenadier clutches\r\n      him; clutches the protrusive dudgeon, whisks it out in the face\r\n      of the world: by Heaven, a very dagger; hunting-knife, or\r\n      whatsoever you call it; fit to drink the life of Patriotism!\r\n\r\n      So fared it with Chevalier de Court, early in the day; not\r\n      without noise; not without commentaries. And now this continually\r\n      increasing multitude at nightfall? Have they daggers too? Alas,\r\n      with them too, after angry parleyings, there has begun a groping\r\n      and a rummaging; all men in black, spite of their Tickets of\r\n      Entry, are clutched by the collar, and groped. Scandalous to\r\n      think of; for always, as the dirk, sword-cane, pistol, or were it\r\n      but tailor’s bodkin, is found on him, and with loud scorn drawn\r\n      forth from him, he, the hapless man in black, is flung all too\r\n      rapidly down stairs. Flung; and ignominiously descends, head\r\n      foremost; accelerated by ignominious shovings from sentry after\r\n      sentry; nay, as is written, by smitings, twitchings,—spurnings,\r\n      _à posteriori_, not to be named. In this accelerated way,\r\n      emerges, uncertain which end uppermost, man after man in black,\r\n      through all issues, into the Tuileries Garden. Emerges, alas,\r\n      into the arms of an indignant multitude, now gathered and\r\n      gathering there, in the hour of dusk, to see what is toward, and\r\n      whether the Hereditary Representative is carried off or not.\r\n      Hapless men in black; at last _convicted_ of poniards made to\r\n      order; convicted “Chevaliers of the Poniard!” Within is as the\r\n      burning ship; without is as the deep sea. Within is no help; his\r\n      Majesty, looking forth, one moment, from his interior\r\n      sanctuaries, coldly bids all visitors “give up their weapons;”\r\n      and shuts the door again. The weapons given up form a heap: the\r\n      convicted Chevaliers of the poniard keep descending pellmell,\r\n      with impetuous velocity; and at the bottom of all staircases, the\r\n      mixed multitude receives them, hustles, buffets, chases and\r\n      disperses them.[349]\r\n\r\n      Such sight meets Lafayette, in the dusk of the evening, as he\r\n      returns, successful with difficulty at Vincennes: Sansculotte\r\n      Scylla hardly weathered, here is Aristocrat Charybdis gurgling\r\n      under his lee! The patient Hero of two Worlds almost loses\r\n      temper. He accelerates, does not retard, the flying Chevaliers;\r\n      delivers, indeed, this or the other hunted Loyalist of quality,\r\n      but rates him in bitter words, such as the hour suggested; such\r\n      as no saloon could pardon. Hero ill-bested; hanging, so to speak,\r\n      in mid-air; hateful to Rich divinities above; hateful to Indigent\r\n      mortals below! Duke de Villequier, Gentleman of the Chamber, gets\r\n      such contumelious rating, in presence of all people there, that\r\n      he may see good first to exculpate himself in the Newspapers;\r\n      then, that not prospering, to retire over the Frontiers, and\r\n      begin plotting at Brussels.[350] His Apartment will stand vacant;\r\n      usefuller, as we may find, than when it stood occupied.\r\n\r\n      So fly the Chevaliers of the Poniard; hunted of Patriotic men,\r\n      shamefully in the thickening dusk. A dim miserable business; born\r\n      of darkness; dying away there in the thickening dusk and dimness!\r\n      In the midst of which, however, let the reader discern clearly\r\n      one figure running for its life: Crispin-Cataline\r\n      d’Espréménil,—for the last time, or the last but one. It is not\r\n      yet three years since these same Centre Grenadiers, Gardes\r\n      Françaises then, marched him towards the Calypso Isles, in the\r\n      gray of the May morning; and he and they have got thus far.\r\n      Buffeted, beaten down, delivered by popular Pétion, he might well\r\n      answer bitterly: ‘And I too, Monsieur, have been carried on the\r\n      People’s shoulders.’[351] A fact which popular Pétion, if he\r\n      like, can meditate.\r\n\r\n      But happily, one way and another, the speedy night covers up this\r\n      ignominious Day of Poniards; and the Chevaliers escape, though\r\n      maltreated, with torn coat-skirts and heavy hearts, to their\r\n      respective dwelling-houses. Riot twofold is quelled; and little\r\n      blood shed, if it be not insignificant blood from the nose:\r\n      Vincennes stands undemolished, reparable; and the Hereditary\r\n      Representative has not been stolen, nor the Queen smuggled into\r\n      Prison. A Day long remembered: commented on with loud hahas and\r\n      deep grumblings; with bitter scornfulness of triumph, bitter\r\n      rancour of defeat. Royalism, as usual, imputes it to d’Orléans\r\n      and the Anarchists intent on insulting Majesty: Patriotism, as\r\n      usual, to Royalists, and even Constitutionalists, intent on\r\n      stealing Majesty to Metz: we, also as usual, to Preternatural\r\n      Suspicion, and Phoebus Apollo having made himself like the Night.\r\n\r\n      Thus, however, has the reader seen, in an unexpected arena, on\r\n      this last day of February 1791, the Three long-contending\r\n      elements of French Society, dashed forth into singular\r\n      comico-tragical collision; acting and reacting openly to the eye.\r\n      Constitutionalism, at once quelling Sansculottic riot at\r\n      Vincennes, and Royalist treachery from the Tuileries, is great,\r\n      this day, and prevails. As for poor Royalism, tossed to and fro\r\n      in that manner, its daggers all left in a heap, what can one\r\n      think of it? Every dog, the Adage says, has its day: _has_ it;\r\n      has had it; or will have it. For the present, the day is\r\n      Lafayette’s and the Constitution’s. Nevertheless Hunger and\r\n      Jacobinism, fast growing fanatical, still work; their-day, were\r\n      they once fanatical, will come. Hitherto, in all tempests,\r\n      Lafayette, like some divine Sea-ruler, raises his serene head:\r\n      the upper Æolus’s blasts fly back to their caves, like foolish\r\n      unbidden winds: the under sea-billows they had vexed into froth\r\n      allay themselves. But if, as we often write, the _sub_marine\r\n      Titanic Fire-powers came into play, the Ocean bed from beneath\r\n      being _burst?_ If they hurled Poseidon Lafayette and his\r\n      Constitution out of Space; and, in the Titanic melee, sea were\r\n      mixed with sky?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.VI.\r\n      Mirabeau.\r\n\r\n      The spirit of France waxes ever more acrid, fever-sick: towards\r\n      the final outburst of dissolution and delirium. Suspicion rules\r\n      all minds: contending parties cannot now commingle; stand\r\n      separated sheer asunder, eying one another, in most aguish mood,\r\n      of cold terror or hot rage. Counter-Revolution, Days of Poniards,\r\n      Castries Duels; Flight of Mesdames, of Monsieur and Royalty!\r\n      Journalism shrills ever louder its cry of alarm. The sleepless\r\n      Dionysius’s Ear of the Forty-eight Sections, how feverishly quick\r\n      has it grown; convulsing with strange pangs the whole sick Body,\r\n      as in such sleeplessness and sickness, the ear will do!\r\n\r\n      Since Royalists get Poniards made to order, and a Sieur Motier is\r\n      no better than he should be, shall not Patriotism too, even of\r\n      the indigent sort, have Pikes, secondhand Firelocks, in readiness\r\n      for the worst? The anvils ring, during this March month, with\r\n      hammering of Pikes. A Constitutional Municipality promulgated its\r\n      Placard, that no citizen except the “active or cash-citizen” was\r\n      entitled to have arms; but there rose, instantly responsive, such\r\n      a tempest of astonishment from Club and Section, that the\r\n      Constitutional Placard, almost next morning, had to cover itself\r\n      up, and die away into inanity, in a second improved edition.[352]\r\n      So the hammering continues; as all that it betokens does.\r\n\r\n      Mark, again, how the extreme tip of the Left is mounting in\r\n      favour, if not in its own National Hall, yet with the Nation,\r\n      especially with Paris. For in such universal panic of doubt, the\r\n      opinion that is sure of itself, as the meagrest opinion may the\r\n      soonest be, is the one to which all men will rally. Great is\r\n      Belief, were it never so meagre; and leads captive the doubting\r\n      heart! Incorruptible Robespierre has been elected Public Accuser\r\n      in our new Courts of Judicature; virtuous Pétion, it is thought,\r\n      may rise to be Mayor. Cordelier Danton, called also by triumphant\r\n      majorities, sits at the Departmental Council-table; colleague\r\n      there of Mirabeau. Of incorruptible Robespierre it was long ago\r\n      predicted that he might go far, mean meagre mortal though he was;\r\n      for Doubt dwelt not in him.\r\n\r\n      Under which circumstances ought not Royalty likewise to cease\r\n      doubting, and begin deciding and acting? Royalty has always that\r\n      sure trump-card in its hand: Flight out of Paris. Which sure\r\n      trump-card, Royalty, as we see, keeps ever and anon clutching at,\r\n      grasping; and swashes it forth tentatively; yet never tables it,\r\n      still puts it back again. Play it, O Royalty! If there be a\r\n      chance left, this seems it, and verily the last chance; and now\r\n      every hour is rendering this a doubtfuller. Alas, one would so\r\n      fain both fly and not fly; play one’s card and have it to play.\r\n      Royalty, in all human likelihood, will not play its trump-card\r\n      till the honours, one after one, be mainly lost; and such\r\n      trumping of it prove to be the sudden finish of the game!\r\n\r\n      Here accordingly a question always arises; of the prophetic sort;\r\n      which cannot now be answered. Suppose Mirabeau, with whom Royalty\r\n      takes deep counsel, as with a Prime Minister that cannot yet\r\n      legally avow himself as such, had got his arrangements\r\n      _completed?_ Arrangements he has; far-stretching plans that dawn\r\n      fitfully on us, by fragments, in the confused darkness. Thirty\r\n      Departments ready to sign loyal Addresses, of prescribed tenor:\r\n      King carried out of Paris, but only to Compiègne and Rouen,\r\n      hardly to Metz, since, once for all, no Emigrant rabble shall\r\n      take the lead in it: National Assembly consenting, by dint of\r\n      loyal Addresses, by management, by force of Bouillé, to hear\r\n      reason, and follow thither![353] Was it so, on _these_ terms,\r\n      that Jacobinism and Mirabeau were then to grapple, in their\r\n      Hercules-and-Typhon duel; death inevitable for the one or the\r\n      other? The duel itself is determined on, and sure: but on what\r\n      terms; much more, with what issue, we in vain guess. It is vague\r\n      darkness all: unknown what is to be; unknown even what has\r\n      already been. The giant Mirabeau walks in darkness, as we said;\r\n      companionless, on wild ways: what his thoughts during these\r\n      months were, no record of Biographer, not vague _Fils Adoptif_,\r\n      will now ever disclose.\r\n\r\n      To us, endeavouring to cast his horoscope, it of course remains\r\n      doubly vague. There is one Herculean man, in internecine duel\r\n      with him, there is Monster after Monster. Emigrant Noblesse\r\n      return, sword on thigh, vaunting of their Loyalty never sullied;\r\n      descending from the air, like Harpy-swarms with ferocity, with\r\n      obscene greed. Earthward there is the Typhon of Anarchy,\r\n      Political, Religious; sprawling hundred-headed, say with\r\n      Twenty-five million heads; wide as the area of France; fierce as\r\n      Frenzy; strong in very Hunger. With these shall the\r\n      Serpent-queller do battle continually, and expect no rest.\r\n\r\n      As for the King, he as usual will go wavering chameleonlike;\r\n      changing colour and purpose with the colour of his\r\n      environment;—good for no Kingly use. On one royal person, on the\r\n      Queen only, can Mirabeau perhaps place dependance. It is\r\n      possible, the greatness of this man, not unskilled too in\r\n      blandishments, courtiership, and graceful adroitness, might, with\r\n      most legitimate sorcery, fascinate the volatile Queen, and fix\r\n      her to him. She has courage for all noble daring; an eye and a\r\n      heart: the soul of Theresa’s Daughter. “_Faut il-donc_, Is it\r\n      fated then,” she passionately writes to her Brother, “that I with\r\n      the blood I am come of, with the sentiments I have, must live and\r\n      die among such mortals?”[354] Alas, poor Princess, Yes. “She is\r\n      the only _man_,” as Mirabeau observes, “whom his Majesty has\r\n      about him.” Of one other man Mirabeau is still surer: of himself.\r\n      There lies his resources; sufficient or insufficient.\r\n\r\n      Dim and great to the eye of Prophecy looks the future! A\r\n      perpetual life-and-death battle; confusion from above and from\r\n      below;—mere confused darkness for us; with here and there some\r\n      streak of faint lurid light. We see King perhaps laid aside; not\r\n      tonsured, tonsuring is out of fashion now; but say, sent away any\r\n      whither, with handsome annual allowance, and stock of\r\n      smith-tools. We see a Queen and Dauphin, Regent and Minor; a\r\n      Queen “mounted on horseback,” in the din of battles, with\r\n      _Moriamur pro rege nostro!_ “Such a day,” Mirabeau writes, “may\r\n      come.”\r\n\r\n      Din of battles, wars more than civil, confusion from above and\r\n      from below: in such environment the eye of Prophecy sees Comte de\r\n      Mirabeau, like some Cardinal de Retz, stormfully maintain\r\n      himself; with head all-devising, heart all-daring, if not\r\n      victorious, yet unvanquished, while life is left him. The\r\n      specialties and issues of it, no eye of Prophecy can guess at: it\r\n      is clouds, we repeat, and tempestuous night; and in the middle of\r\n      it, now visible, far darting, now labouring in eclipse, is\r\n      Mirabeau indomitably struggling to be Cloud-Compeller!—One can\r\n      say that, had Mirabeau lived, the History of France and of the\r\n      World had been different. Further, that the man would have\r\n      needed, as few men ever did, the whole compass of that same “Art\r\n      of Daring, _Art d’Oser_,” which he so prized; and likewise that\r\n      he, above all men then living, would have practised and\r\n      manifested it. Finally, that some substantiality, and no empty\r\n      simulacrum of a formula, would have been the result realised by\r\n      him: a result you could have loved, a result you could have\r\n      hated; by no likelihood, a result you could only have rejected\r\n      with closed lips, and swept into quick forgetfulness for ever.\r\n      Had Mirabeau lived one other year!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.3.VII.\r\n      Death of Mirabeau.\r\n\r\n      But Mirabeau could not live another year, any more than he could\r\n      live another thousand years. Men’s years are numbered, and the\r\n      tale of Mirabeau’s was now complete. Important, or unimportant;\r\n      to be mentioned in World-History for some centuries, or not to be\r\n      mentioned there beyond a day or two,—it matters not to peremptory\r\n      Fate. From amid the press of ruddy busy Life, the Pale Messenger\r\n      beckons silently: wide-spreading interests, projects, salvation\r\n      of French Monarchies, what thing soever man has on hand, he must\r\n      suddenly quit it all, and go. Wert thou saving French Monarchies;\r\n      wert thou blacking shoes on the Pont Neuf! The most important of\r\n      men cannot stay; did the World’s History depend on an hour, that\r\n      hour is not to be given. Whereby, indeed, it comes that these\r\n      same _would-have-beens_ are mostly a vanity; and the World’s\r\n      History could never in the least be what it would, or might, or\r\n      should, by any manner of potentiality, but simply and altogether\r\n      what it _is_.\r\n\r\n      The fierce wear and tear of such an existence has wasted out the\r\n      giant oaken strength of Mirabeau. A fret and fever that keeps\r\n      heart and brain on fire: excess of effort, of excitement; excess\r\n      of all kinds: labour incessant, almost beyond credibility! “If I\r\n      had not lived with him,” says Dumont, “I should never have known\r\n      what a man can make of one day; what things may be placed within\r\n      the interval of twelve hours. A day for this man was more than a\r\n      week or a month is for others: the mass of things he guided on\r\n      together was prodigious; from the scheming to the executing not a\r\n      moment lost.” ‘Monsieur le Comte,’ said his Secretary to him\r\n      once, ‘what you require is impossible.’—‘Impossible!’ answered he\r\n      starting from his chair, ‘_Ne me dites jamais ce bête de mot_,\r\n      Never name to me that blockhead of a word.’[355] And then the\r\n      social repasts; the dinner which he gives as Commandant of\r\n      National Guards, which “costs five hundred pounds;” alas, and\r\n      “the Sirens of the Opera;” and all the ginger that is hot in the\r\n      mouth:—down what a course is this man hurled! Cannot Mirabeau\r\n      stop; cannot he fly, and save himself alive? No! There is a\r\n      Nessus’ Shirt on this Hercules; he must storm and burn there,\r\n      without rest, till he be consumed. Human strength, never so\r\n      Herculean, has its measure. Herald shadows flit pale across the\r\n      fire-brain of Mirabeau; heralds of the pale repose. While he\r\n      tosses and storms, straining every nerve, in that sea of ambition\r\n      and confusion, there comes, sombre and still, a monition that for\r\n      him the issue of it will be swift death.\r\n\r\n      In January last, you might see him as President of the Assembly;\r\n      “his neck wrapt in linen cloths, at the evening session:” there\r\n      was sick heat of the blood, alternate darkening and flashing in\r\n      the eye-sight; he had to apply leeches, after the morning labour,\r\n      and preside bandaged. “At parting he embraced me,” says Dumont,\r\n      “with an emotion I had never seen in him: ‘I am dying, my friend;\r\n      dying as by slow fire; we shall perhaps not meet again. When I am\r\n      gone, they will know what the value of me was. The miseries I\r\n      have held back will burst from all sides on France.’”[356]\r\n      Sickness gives louder warning; but cannot be listened to. On the\r\n      27th day of March, proceeding towards the Assembly, he had to\r\n      seek rest and help in Friend de Lamarck’s, by the road; and lay\r\n      there, for an hour, half-fainted, stretched on a sofa. To the\r\n      Assembly nevertheless he went, as if in spite of Destiny itself;\r\n      spoke, loud and eager, five several times; then quitted the\r\n      Tribune—for ever. He steps out, utterly exhausted, into the\r\n      Tuileries Gardens; many people press round him, as usual, with\r\n      applications, memorials; he says to the Friend who was with him:\r\n      Take me out of this!\r\n\r\n      And so, on the last day of March 1791, endless anxious multitudes\r\n      beset the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin; incessantly inquiring:\r\n      within doors there, in that House numbered in our time “42,” the\r\n      over wearied giant has fallen down, to die.[357] Crowds, of all\r\n      parties and kinds; of all ranks from the King to the meanest man!\r\n      The King sends publicly twice a-day to inquire; privately\r\n      besides: from the world at large there is no end of inquiring. “A\r\n      written bulletin is handed out every three hours,” is copied and\r\n      circulated; in the end, it is printed. The People spontaneously\r\n      keep silence; no carriage shall enter with its noise: there is\r\n      crowding pressure; but the Sister of Mirabeau is reverently\r\n      recognised, and has free way made for her. The People stand mute,\r\n      heart-stricken; to all it seems as if a great calamity were nigh:\r\n      as if the last man of France, who could have swayed these coming\r\n      troubles, lay there at hand-grips with the unearthly Power.\r\n\r\n      The silence of a whole People, the wakeful toil of Cabanis,\r\n      Friend and Physician, skills not: on Saturday, the second day of\r\n      April, Mirabeau feels that the last of the Days has risen for\r\n      him; that, on this day, he has to depart and be no more. His\r\n      death is Titanic, as his life has been. Lit up, for the last\r\n      time, in the glare of coming dissolution, the mind of the man is\r\n      all glowing and burning; utters itself in sayings, such as men\r\n      long remember. He longs to live, yet acquiesces in death, argues\r\n      not with the inexorable. His speech is wild and wondrous:\r\n      unearthly Phantasms dancing now their torch-dance round his soul;\r\n      the soul itself looking out, fire-radiant, motionless, girt\r\n      together for that great hour! At times comes a beam of light from\r\n      him on the world he is quitting. ‘I carry in my heart the\r\n      death-dirge of the French Monarchy; the dead remains of it will\r\n      now be the spoil of the factious.’ Or again, when he heard the\r\n      cannon fire, what is characteristic too: ‘Have we the Achilles’\r\n      Funeral already?’ So likewise, while some friend is supporting\r\n      him: ‘Yes, support that head; would I could bequeath it thee!’\r\n      For the man dies as he has lived; self-conscious, conscious of a\r\n      world looking on. He gazes forth on the young Spring, which for\r\n      him will never be Summer. The Sun has risen; he says: ‘_Si ce\r\n      n’est pas là Dieu, c’est du moins son cousin\r\n      germain_.’[358]—Death has mastered the outworks; power of speech\r\n      is gone; the citadel of the heart still holding out: the moribund\r\n      giant, passionately, by sign, demands paper and pen; writes his\r\n      passionate demand for opium, to end these agonies. The sorrowful\r\n      Doctor shakes his head: _Dormir_ “To sleep,” writes the other,\r\n      passionately pointing at it! So dies a gigantic Heathen and\r\n      Titan; stumbling blindly, undismayed, down to his rest. At\r\n      half-past eight in the morning, Dr. Petit, standing at the foot\r\n      of the bed, says ‘_Il ne souffre plus_.’ His suffering and his\r\n      working are now ended.\r\n\r\n      Even so, ye silent Patriot multitudes, all ye men of France; this\r\n      man is rapt away from you. He has fallen suddenly, without\r\n      bending till he broke; as a tower falls, smitten by sudden\r\n      lightning. His word ye shall hear no more, his guidance follow no\r\n      more.—The multitudes depart, heartstruck; spread the sad tidings.\r\n      How touching is the loyalty of men to their Sovereign Man! All\r\n      theatres, public amusements close; no joyful meeting can be held\r\n      in these nights, joy is not for them: the People break in upon\r\n      private dancing-parties, and sullenly command that they cease. Of\r\n      such dancing-parties apparently but two came to light; and these\r\n      also have gone out. The gloom is universal: never in this City\r\n      was such sorrow for one death; never since that old night when\r\n      Louis XII. departed, “and the _Crieurs des Corps_ went sounding\r\n      their bells, and crying along the streets: _Le bon roi Louis,\r\n      père du peuple, est mort_, The good King Louis, Father of the\r\n      People, is dead!”[359] King Mirabeau is now the lost King; and\r\n      one may say with little exaggeration, all the People mourns for\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      For three days there is low wide moan: weeping in the National\r\n      Assembly itself. The streets are all mournful; orators mounted on\r\n      the _bornes_, with large silent audience, preaching the funeral\r\n      sermon of the dead. Let no coachman whip fast, distractively with\r\n      his rolling wheels, or almost at all, through these groups! His\r\n      traces may be cut; himself and his fare, as incurable\r\n      Aristocrats, hurled sulkily into the kennels. The bourne-stone\r\n      orators speak as it is given them; the Sansculottic People, with\r\n      its rude soul, listens eager,—as men will to any Sermon, or\r\n      _Sermo_, when it _is_ a spoken Word meaning a Thing, and not a\r\n      Babblement meaning No-thing. In the Restaurateur’s of the Palais\r\n      Royal, the waiter remarks, ‘Fine weather, Monsieur:’—‘Yes, my\r\n      friend,’ answers the ancient Man of Letters, ‘very fine; but\r\n      Mirabeau is dead.’ Hoarse rhythmic threnodies comes also from the\r\n      throats of balladsingers; are sold on gray-white paper at a _sou_\r\n      each.[360] But of Portraits, engraved, painted, hewn, and\r\n      written; of Eulogies, Reminiscences, Biographies, nay\r\n      _Vaudevilles_, Dramas and Melodramas, in all Provinces of France,\r\n      there will, through these coming months, be the due immeasurable\r\n      crop; thick as the leaves of Spring. Nor, that a tincture of\r\n      burlesque might be in it, is Gobel’s Episcopal _Mandement_\r\n      wanting; goose Gobel, who has just been made Constitutional\r\n      Bishop of Paris. A Mandement wherein _Ça ira_ alternates very\r\n      strangely with _Nomine Domini_, and you are, with a grave\r\n      countenance, invited to “rejoice at possessing in the midst of\r\n      you a body of Prelates created by Mirabeau, zealous followers of\r\n      his doctrine, faithful imitators of his virtues.”[361] So speaks,\r\n      and cackles manifold, the Sorrow of France; wailing articulately,\r\n      inarticulately, as it can, that a Sovereign Man is snatched away.\r\n      In the National Assembly, when difficult questions are astir, all\r\n      eyes will “turn mechanically to the place where Mirabeau\r\n      sat,”—and Mirabeau is absent now.\r\n\r\n      On the third evening of the lamentation, the fourth of April,\r\n      there is solemn Public Funeral; such as deceased mortal seldom\r\n      had. Procession of a league in length; of mourners reckoned\r\n      loosely at a hundred thousand! All roofs are thronged with\r\n      onlookers, all windows, lamp-irons, branches of trees. “Sadness\r\n      is painted on every countenance; many persons weep.” There is\r\n      double hedge of National Guards; there is National Assembly in a\r\n      body; Jacobin Society, and Societies; King’s Ministers,\r\n      Municipals, and all Notabilities, Patriot or Aristocrat. Bouillé\r\n      is noticeable there, “with his hat on;” say, hat drawn over his\r\n      brow, hiding many thoughts! Slow-wending, in religious silence,\r\n      the Procession of a league in length, under the level sun-rays,\r\n      for it is five o’clock, moves and marches: with its sable plumes;\r\n      itself in a religious silence; but, by fits, with the muffled\r\n      roll of drums, by fits with some long-drawn wail of music, and\r\n      strange new clangour of trombones, and metallic dirge-voice; amid\r\n      the infinite hum of men. In the Church of Saint-Eustache, there\r\n      is funeral oration by Cerutti; and discharge of fire-arms, which\r\n      “brings down pieces of the plaster.” Thence, forward again to the\r\n      Church of Sainte-Genevieve; which has been consecrated, by\r\n      supreme decree, on the spur of this time, into a Pantheon for the\r\n      Great Men of the Fatherland, _Aux Grands Hommes la Patrie\r\n      réconnaissante_. Hardly at midnight is the business done; and\r\n      Mirabeau left in his dark dwelling: first tenant of that\r\n      Fatherland’s Pantheon.\r\n\r\n      Tenant, alas, who inhabits but at will, and shall be cast out!\r\n      For, in these days of convulsion and disjection, not even the\r\n      dust of the dead is permitted to rest. Voltaire’s bones are, by\r\n      and by, to be carried from their stolen grave in the Abbéy of\r\n      Scellières, to an eager _stealing_ grave, in Paris his\r\n      birth-city: all mortals processioning and perorating there; cars\r\n      drawn by eight white horses, goadsters in classical costume, with\r\n      fillets and wheat-ears enough;—though the weather is of the\r\n      wettest.[362] Evangelist Jean Jacques, too, as is most proper,\r\n      must be dug up from Ermenonville, and processioned, with pomp,\r\n      with sensibility, to the Pantheon of the Fatherland.[363] He and\r\n      others: while again Mirabeau, we say, is cast forth from it,\r\n      happily incapable of being replaced; and rests now,\r\n      irrecognisable, reburied hastily at dead of night, in the central\r\n      “part of the Churchyard Sainte-Catherine, in the Suburb\r\n      Saint-Marceau,” to be disturbed no further.\r\n\r\n      So blazes out, farseen, a Man’s Life, and becomes ashes and a\r\n      _caput mortuum_, in this World-Pyre, which we name French\r\n      Revolution: not the first that consumed itself there; nor, by\r\n      thousands and many millions, the last! A man who “had swallowed\r\n      all formulas;” who, in these strange times and circumstances,\r\n      felt called to live Titanically, and also to die so. As he, for\r\n      his part had swallowed all formulas, what Formula is there, never\r\n      so comprehensive, that will express truly the _plus_ and the\r\n      _minus_, give us the accurate net-result of him? There is\r\n      hitherto none such. Moralities not a few must shriek condemnatory\r\n      over this Mirabeau; the Morality by which he could be judged has\r\n      not yet got uttered in the speech of men. We shall say this of\r\n      him, again: That he is a Reality, and no Simulacrum: a living son\r\n      of Nature our general Mother; not a hollow Artfice, and mechanism\r\n      of Conventionalities, son of nothing, _brother_ to nothing. In\r\n      which little word, let the earnest man, walking sorrowful in a\r\n      world mostly of “Stuffed Clothes-suits,” that chatter and grin\r\n      meaningless on him, quite _ghastly_ to the earnest soul,—think\r\n      what significance there is!\r\n\r\n      Of men who, in such sense, are alive, and see with eyes, the\r\n      number is now not great: it may be well, if in this huge French\r\n      Revolution itself, with its all-developing fury, we find some\r\n      Three. Mortals driven rabid we find; sputtering the acridest\r\n      logic; baring their breast to the battle-hail, their neck to the\r\n      guillotine; of whom it is so painful to say that they too are\r\n      still, in good part, manufactured Formalities, not Facts but\r\n      Hearsays!\r\n\r\n      Honour to the strong man, in these ages, who has shaken himself\r\n      loose of shams, and is something. For in the way of being\r\n      _worthy_, the first condition surely is that one _be_. Let Cant\r\n      cease, at all risks and at all costs: till Cant cease, nothing\r\n      else can begin. Of human Criminals, in these centuries, writes\r\n      the Moralist, I find but one unforgivable: the Quack. “Hateful to\r\n      God,” as divine Dante sings, “and to the Enemies of God,\r\n\r\n      ‘A Dio spiacente ed a’ nemici sui!’\r\n\r\n\r\n      But whoever will, with sympathy, which is the first essential\r\n      towards insight, look at this questionable Mirabeau, may find\r\n      that there lay verily in him, as the basis of all, a Sincerity, a\r\n      great free Earnestness; nay call it Honesty, for the man did\r\n      before all things see, with that clear flashing vision, into what\r\n      was, into what existed as fact; and did, with his wild heart,\r\n      follow that and no other. Whereby on what ways soever he travels\r\n      and struggles, often enough falling, he is still a brother man.\r\n      Hate him not; thou canst not hate him! Shining through such soil\r\n      and tarnish, and now victorious effulgent, and oftenest\r\n      struggling eclipsed, the light of genius itself is in this man;\r\n      which was never yet base and hateful: but at worst was\r\n      lamentable, loveable with pity. They say that he was ambitious,\r\n      that he wanted to be Minister. It is most true; and was he not\r\n      simply the one man in France who could have done any good as\r\n      Minister? Not vanity alone, not pride alone; far from that! Wild\r\n      burstings of affection were in this great heart; of fierce\r\n      lightning, and soft dew of pity. So sunk, bemired in wretchedest\r\n      defacements, it may be said of him, like the Magdalen of old,\r\n      that he loved much: his Father the harshest of old crabbed men he\r\n      loved with warmth, with veneration.\r\n\r\n      Be it that his falls and follies are manifold,—as himself often\r\n      lamented even with tears.[364] Alas, is not the Life of every\r\n      such man already a poetic Tragedy; made up “of Fate and of one’s\r\n      own Deservings,” of _Schicksal und eigene Schuld;_ full of the\r\n      elements of Pity and Fear? This brother man, if not Epic for us,\r\n      is Tragic; if not great, is large; large in his qualities,\r\n      world-large in his destinies. Whom other men, recognising him as\r\n      such, may, through long times, remember, and draw nigh to examine\r\n      and consider: these, in their several dialects, will say of him\r\n      and sing of him,—till the right thing be said; and so the Formula\r\n      that _can_ judge him be no longer an undiscovered one.\r\n\r\n      Here then the wild Gabriel Honoré drops from the tissue of our\r\n      History; not without a tragic farewell. He is gone: the flower of\r\n      the wild Riquetti or Arrighetti kindred; which seems as if in\r\n      him, with one last effort, it had done its best, and then\r\n      expired, or sunk down to the undistinguished level. Crabbed old\r\n      Marquis Mirabeau, the Friend of Men, sleeps sound. The Bailli\r\n      Mirabeau, worthy uncle, will soon die forlorn, alone.\r\n      Barrel-Mirabeau, already gone across the Rhine, his Regiment of\r\n      Emigrants will drive nigh desperate. “Barrel-Mirabeau,” says a\r\n      biographer of his, “went indignantly across the Rhine, and\r\n      drilled Emigrant Regiments. But as he sat one morning in his\r\n      tent, sour of stomach doubtless and of heart, meditating in\r\n      Tartarean humour on the turn things took, a certain Captain or\r\n      Subaltern demanded admittance on business. Such Captain is\r\n      refused; he again demands, with refusal; and then again, till\r\n      Colonel Viscount Barrel-Mirabeau, blazing up into a mere burning\r\n      brandy barrel, clutches his sword, and tumbles out on this\r\n      _canaille_ of an intruder,—alas, on the _canaille_ of an\r\n      intruder’s sword’s point, who had drawn with swift dexterity; and\r\n      dies, and the Newspapers name it _apoplexy_ and _alarming\r\n      accident_.” So die the Mirabeaus.\r\n\r\n      New Mirabeaus one hears not of: the wild kindred, as we said, is\r\n      gone out with this its greatest. As families and kindreds\r\n      sometimes do; producing, after long ages of unnoted notability,\r\n      some living quintescence of all the qualities they had, to flame\r\n      forth as a man world-noted; after whom they rest as if exhausted;\r\n      the sceptre passing to others. The chosen Last of the Mirabeaus\r\n      is gone; the chosen man of France is gone. It was he who shook\r\n      old France from its basis; and, as if with his single hand, has\r\n      held it toppling there, still unfallen. What things depended on\r\n      that one man! He is as a ship suddenly shivered on sunk rocks:\r\n      much swims on the waste waters, far from help.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 2.IV.\r\n      VARENNES\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.I.\r\n      Easter at Saint-Cloud.\r\n\r\n      The French Monarchy may now therefore be considered as, in all\r\n      human probability, lost; as struggling henceforth in blindness as\r\n      well as weakness, the last light of reasonable guidance having\r\n      gone out. What remains of resources their poor Majesties will\r\n      waste still further, in uncertain loitering and wavering.\r\n      Mirabeau himself had to complain that they only gave him half\r\n      confidence, and always had some plan within his plan. Had they\r\n      fled frankly with him, to Rouen or anywhither, long ago! They may\r\n      fly now with chance immeasurably lessened; which will go on\r\n      lessening towards absolute zero. Decide, O Queen; poor Louis can\r\n      decide nothing: execute this Flight-project, or at least abandon\r\n      it. Correspondence with Bouillé there has been enough; what\r\n      profits consulting, and hypothesis, while all around is in fierce\r\n      activity of practice? The Rustic sits waiting till the river run\r\n      dry: alas with you it is not a common river, but a Nile\r\n      Inundation; snow melting in the unseen mountains; till all, and\r\n      you where you sit, be submerged.\r\n\r\n      Many things invite to flight. The voice Journals invites;\r\n      Royalist Journals proudly hinting it as a threat, Patriot\r\n      Journals rabidly denouncing it as a terror. Mother Society,\r\n      waxing more and more emphatic, invites;—so emphatic that, as was\r\n      prophesied, Lafayette and your limited Patriots have ere long to\r\n      branch off from her, and form themselves into Feuillans; with\r\n      infinite public controversy; the victory in which, doubtful\r\n      though it look, will remain with the _un_limited Mother.\r\n      Moreover, ever since the Day of Poniards, we have seen unlimited\r\n      Patriotism openly equipping itself with arms. Citizens denied\r\n      “activity,” which is facetiously made to signify a certain weight\r\n      of purse, cannot buy blue uniforms, and be Guardsmen; but man is\r\n      greater than blue cloth; man can fight, if need be, in multiform\r\n      cloth, or even almost without cloth—as Sansculotte. So Pikes\r\n      continued to be hammered, whether those Dirks of improved\r\n      structure with barbs be “meant for the West-India market,” or not\r\n      meant. Men beat, the wrong way, their ploughshares into swords.\r\n      Is there not what we may call an “Austrian Committee,” _Comité\r\n      Autrichein_, sitting daily and nightly in the Tuileries?\r\n      Patriotism, by vision and suspicion, knows it too well! If the\r\n      King fly, will there not be Aristocrat-Austrian Invasion;\r\n      butchery, replacement of Feudalism; wars more than civil? The\r\n      hearts of men are saddened and maddened.\r\n\r\n      Dissident Priests likewise give trouble enough. Expelled from\r\n      their Parish Churches, where Constitutional Priests, elected by\r\n      the Public, have replaced them, these unhappy persons resort to\r\n      Convents of Nuns, or other such receptacles; and there, on\r\n      Sabbath, collecting assemblages of Anti-Constitutional\r\n      individuals, who have grown devout all on a sudden,[365] they\r\n      worship or pretend to worship in their strait-laced contumacious\r\n      manner; to the scandal of Patriotism. Dissident Priests, passing\r\n      along with their sacred wafer for the dying, seem wishful to be\r\n      massacred in the streets; wherein Patriotism will not gratify\r\n      them. Slighter palm of martyrdom, however, shall not be denied:\r\n      martyrdom not of massacre, yet of fustigation. At the refractory\r\n      places of worship, Patriot men appear; Patriot women with strong\r\n      hazel wands, which they apply. Shut thy eyes, O Reader; see not\r\n      this misery, peculiar to these later times,—of martyrdom without\r\n      sincerity, with only cant and contumacy! A dead Catholic Church\r\n      is not allowed to lie dead; no, it is _galvanised_ into the\r\n      detestablest death-life; whereat Humanity, we say, shuts its\r\n      eyes. For the Patriot women take their hazel wands, and\r\n      fustigate, amid laughter of bystanders, with alacrity: broad\r\n      bottom of Priests; alas, Nuns too reversed, and _cotillons\r\n      retroussés!_ The National Guard does what it can: Municipality\r\n      “invokes the Principles of Toleration;” grants Dissident\r\n      worshippers the Church of the _Théatins;_ promising protection.\r\n      But it is to no purpose: at the door of that _Théatins;_ Church,\r\n      appears a Placard, and suspended atop, like Plebeian Consular\r\n      _fasces_,—a Bundle of Rods! The Principles of Toleration must do\r\n      the best they may: but no Dissident man shall worship\r\n      contumaciously; there is a _Plebiscitum_ to that effect; which,\r\n      though unspoken, is like the laws of the Medes and Persians.\r\n      Dissident contumacious Priests ought not to be harboured, even in\r\n      private, by any man: the Club of the Cordeliers openly denounces\r\n      Majesty himself as doing it.[366]\r\n\r\n      Many things invite to flight: but probably this thing above all\r\n      others, that it has become impossible! On the 15th of April,\r\n      notice is given that his Majesty, who has suffered much from\r\n      catarrh lately, will enjoy the Spring weather, for a few days, at\r\n      Saint-Cloud. Out at Saint-Cloud? Wishing to celebrate his Easter,\r\n      his _Pâques_, or Pasch, there; with refractory\r\n      Anti-Constitutional Dissidents?—Wishing rather to make off for\r\n      Compiègne, and thence to the Frontiers? As were, in good sooth,\r\n      perhaps feasible, or would once have been; nothing but some two\r\n      _chasseurs_ attending you; chasseurs easily corrupted! It is a\r\n      pleasant possibility, execute it or not. Men say there are thirty\r\n      thousand Chevaliers of the Poniard lurking in the woods there:\r\n      lurking in the woods, and thirty thousand,—for the human\r\n      Imagination is not fettered. But now, how easily might these,\r\n      dashing out on Lafayette, snatch off the Hereditary\r\n      Representative; and roll away with him, after the manner of a\r\n      whirlblast, whither they listed!—Enough, it were well the King\r\n      did not go. Lafayette is forewarned and forearmed: but, indeed,\r\n      is the risk his only; or his and all France’s?\r\n\r\n      Monday the eighteenth of April is come; the Easter Journey to\r\n      Saint-Cloud shall take effect. National Guard has got its orders;\r\n      a First Division, as Advanced Guard, has even marched, and\r\n      probably arrived. His Majesty’s _Maison-bouche_, they say, is all\r\n      busy stewing and frying at Saint-Cloud; the King’s Dinner not far\r\n      from ready there. About one o’clock, the Royal Carriage, with its\r\n      eight royal blacks, shoots stately into the Place du Carrousel;\r\n      draws up to receive its royal burden. But hark! From the\r\n      neighbouring Church of Saint-Roch, the tocsin begins\r\n      ding-donging. Is the King stolen then; he is going; gone?\r\n      Multitudes of persons crowd the Carrousel: the Royal Carriage\r\n      still stands there;—and, by Heaven’s strength, shall stand!\r\n\r\n      Lafayette comes up, with aide-de-camps and oratory; pervading the\r\n      groups: ‘_Taisez vous_,’ answer the groups, ‘the King shall not\r\n      go.’ Monsieur appears, at an upper window: ten thousand voices\r\n      bray and shriek, ‘_Nous ne voulons pas que le Roi parte_.’ Their\r\n      Majesties have mounted. Crack go the whips; but twenty Patriot\r\n      arms have seized each of the eight bridles: there is rearing,\r\n      rocking, vociferation; not the smallest headway. In vain does\r\n      Lafayette fret, indignant; and perorate and strive: Patriots in\r\n      the passion of terror, bellow round the Royal Carriage; it is one\r\n      bellowing sea of Patriot terror run frantic. Will Royalty fly off\r\n      towards Austria; like a lit rocket, towards endless Conflagration\r\n      of Civil War? Stop it, ye Patriots, in the name of Heaven! Rude\r\n      voices passionately apostrophise Royalty itself. Usher Campan,\r\n      and other the like official persons, pressing forward with help\r\n      or advice, are clutched by the sashes, and hurled and whirled, in\r\n      a confused perilous manner; so that her Majesty has to plead\r\n      passionately from the carriage-window.\r\n\r\n      Order cannot be heard, cannot be followed; National Guards know\r\n      not how to act. Centre Grenadiers, of the Observatoire Battalion,\r\n      are there; not on duty; alas, in quasi-mutiny; speaking rude\r\n      disobedient words; threatening the mounted Guards with sharp shot\r\n      if they hurt the people. Lafayette mounts and dismounts; runs\r\n      haranguing, panting; on the verge of despair. For an hour and\r\n      three-quarters; “seven quarters of an hour,” by the Tuileries\r\n      Clock! Desperate Lafayette will open a passage, were it by the\r\n      cannon’s mouth, if his Majesty will order. Their Majesties,\r\n      counselled to it by Royalist friends, by Patriot foes, dismount;\r\n      and retire in, with heavy indignant heart; giving up the\r\n      enterprise. _Maison-bouche_ may eat that cooked dinner\r\n      themselves; his Majesty shall not see Saint-Cloud this day,—or\r\n      any day.[367]\r\n\r\n      The pathetic fable of imprisonment in one’s own Palace has become\r\n      a sad fact, then? Majesty complains to Assembly; Municipality\r\n      deliberates, proposes to petition or address; Sections respond\r\n      with sullen brevity of negation. Lafayette flings down his\r\n      Commission; appears in civic pepper-and-salt frock; and cannot be\r\n      flattered back again;—not in less than three days; and by\r\n      unheard-of entreaty; National Guards kneeling to him, and\r\n      declaring that it is not sycophancy, that they are free men\r\n      kneeling here to the _Statue of Liberty_. For the rest, those\r\n      Centre Grenadiers of the Observatoire are disbanded,—yet indeed\r\n      are reinlisted, all but fourteen, under a new name, and with new\r\n      quarters. The King must keep his Easter in Paris: meditating much\r\n      on this singular posture of things: but as good as determined now\r\n      to fly from it, desire being whetted by difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.II.\r\n      Easter at Paris.\r\n\r\n      For above a year, ever since March 1790, it would seem, there has\r\n      hovered a project of Flight before the royal mind; and ever and\r\n      anon has been condensing itself into something like a purpose;\r\n      but this or the other difficulty always vaporised it again. It\r\n      seems so full of risks, perhaps of civil war itself; above all,\r\n      it cannot be done without effort. Somnolent laziness will not\r\n      serve: to fly, if not in a leather _vache_, one must verily stir\r\n      himself. Better to adopt that Constitution of theirs; execute it\r\n      so as to shew all men that it is inexecutable? Better or not so\r\n      good; surely it is _easier_. To all difficulties you need only\r\n      say, There is a lion in the path, behold your Constitution will\r\n      not act! For a somnolent person it requires no effort to\r\n      counterfeit death,—as Dame de Staël and Friends of Liberty can\r\n      see the King’s Government long doing, _faisant le mort_.\r\n\r\n      Nay now, when desire whetted by difficulty has brought the matter\r\n      to a head, and the royal mind no longer halts between two, what\r\n      can come of it? Grant that poor Louis were safe with Bouillé,\r\n      what on the whole could he look for there? Exasperated Tickets of\r\n      Entry answer, Much, all. But cold Reason answers, Little almost\r\n      nothing. Is not loyalty a law of Nature? ask the Tickets of\r\n      Entry. Is not love of your King, and even death for him, the\r\n      glory of all Frenchmen,—except these few Democrats? Let Democrat\r\n      Constitution-builders see what they will do without their\r\n      Keystone; and France rend its hair, having lost the Hereditary\r\n      Representative!\r\n\r\n      Thus will King Louis fly; one sees not reasonably towards what.\r\n      As a maltreated Boy, shall we say, who, having a Stepmother,\r\n      rushes sulky into the wide world; and will wring the paternal\r\n      heart?—Poor Louis escapes from known unsupportable evils, to an\r\n      unknown mixture of good and evil, coloured by Hope. He goes, as\r\n      Rabelais did when dying, to seek a great May-be: _je vais\r\n      chercher un grand Peut-être!_ As not only the sulky Boy but the\r\n      wise grown Man is obliged to do, so often, in emergencies.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, there is still no lack of stimulants, and stepdame\r\n      maltreatments, to keep one’s resolution at the due pitch.\r\n      Factious disturbance ceases not: as indeed how can they, unless\r\n      authoritatively _conjured_, in a Revolt which is by nature\r\n      bottomless? If the ceasing of faction be the price of the King’s\r\n      somnolence, he may awake when he will, and take wing.\r\n\r\n      Remark, in any case, what somersets and contortions a dead\r\n      Catholicism is making,—skilfully galvanised: hideous, and even\r\n      piteous, to behold! Jurant and Dissident, with their shaved\r\n      crowns, argue frothing everywhere; or are ceasing to argue, and\r\n      stripping for battle. In Paris was scourging while need\r\n      continued: contrariwise, in the Morbihan of Brittany, without\r\n      scourging, armed Peasants are up, roused by pulpit-drum, they\r\n      know not why. General Dumouriez, who has got missioned\r\n      thitherward, finds all in sour heat of darkness; finds also that\r\n      explanation and conciliation will still do much.[368]\r\n\r\n      But again, consider this: that his Holiness, Pius Sixth, has seen\r\n      good to excommunicate Bishop Talleyrand! Surely, we will say\r\n      then, considering it, there is no living or dead Church in the\r\n      Earth that has not the indubitablest right to excommunicate\r\n      Talleyrand. Pope Pius has right and might, in his way. But truly\r\n      so likewise has Father Adam, _ci-devant_ Marquis Saint-Huruge, in\r\n      his way. Behold, therefore, on the Fourth of May, in the\r\n      Palais-Royal, a mixed loud-sounding multitude; in the middle of\r\n      whom, Father Adam, bull-voiced Saint-Huruge, in white hat, towers\r\n      visible and audible. With him, it is said, walks Journalist\r\n      Gorsas, walk many others of the washed sort; for no authority\r\n      will interfere. Pius Sixth, with his plush and tiara, and power\r\n      of the Keys, they bear aloft: of natural size,—made of lath and\r\n      combustible gum. Royou, the King’s Friend, is borne too in\r\n      effigy; with a pile of Newspaper _King’s-Friends_, condemned\r\n      numbers of the _Ami-du-Roi;_ fit fuel of the sacrifice. Speeches\r\n      are spoken; a judgment is held, a doom proclaimed, audible in\r\n      bull-voice, towards the four winds. And thus, amid great\r\n      shouting, the holocaust is consummated, under the summer sky; and\r\n      our lath-and-gum Holiness, with the attendant victims, mounts up\r\n      in flame, and sinks down in ashes; a decomposed Pope: and right\r\n      or might, among all the parties, has better or worse accomplished\r\n      itself, as it could.[369] But, on the whole, reckoning from\r\n      Martin Luther in the Marketplace of Wittenberg to Marquis\r\n      Saint-Huruge in this Palais-Royal of Paris, what a journey have\r\n      we gone; into what strange territories has it carried us! No\r\n      Authority can now interfere. Nay Religion herself, mourning for\r\n      such things, may after all ask, What have _I_ to do with them?\r\n\r\n      In such extraordinary manner does dead Catholicism somerset and\r\n      caper, skilfully galvanised. For, does the reader inquire into\r\n      the subject-matter of controversy in this case; what the\r\n      difference between Orthodoxy or _My-doxy_ and Heterodoxy or\r\n      _Thy-doxy_ might here be? My-doxy is that an august National\r\n      Assembly can equalize the extent of Bishopricks; that an\r\n      equalized Bishop, his Creed and Formularies being left quite as\r\n      they were, can swear Fidelity to King, Law and Nation, and so\r\n      become a Constitutional Bishop. Thy-doxy, if thou be Dissident,\r\n      is that he cannot; but that he must become an accursed thing.\r\n      Human ill-nature needs but some Homoiousian _iota_, or even the\r\n      pretence of one; and will flow copiously through the eye of a\r\n      needle: thus always must mortals go jargoning and fuming,\r\n\r\n     And, like the ancient Stoics in their porches\r\n     With fierce dispute maintain their churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n      This _Auto-da-fé_ of Saint-Huruge’s was on the Fourth of May,\r\n      1791. Royalty sees it; but says nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.III.\r\n      Count Fersen.\r\n\r\n      Royalty, in fact, should, by this time, be far on with its\r\n      preparations. Unhappily much preparation is needful: could a\r\n      Hereditary Representative be carried in leather _vache_, how easy\r\n      were it! But it is not so.\r\n\r\n      New clothes are needed, as usual, in all Epic transactions, were\r\n      it in the grimmest iron ages; consider “Queen Chrimhilde, with\r\n      her sixty semstresses,” in that iron _Nibelungen Song!_ No Queen\r\n      can stir without new clothes. Therefore, now, Dame Campan whisks\r\n      assiduous to this mantua-maker and to that: and there is clipping\r\n      of frocks and gowns, upper clothes and under, great and small;\r\n      such a clipping and sewing, as might have been dispensed with.\r\n      Moreover, her Majesty cannot go a step anywhither without her\r\n      _Nécessaire;_ dear _Nécessaire_, of inlaid ivory and rosewood;\r\n      cunningly devised; which holds perfumes, toilet-implements,\r\n      infinite small queenlike furnitures: Necessary to terrestrial\r\n      life. Not without a cost of some five hundred louis, of much\r\n      precious time, and difficult hoodwinking which does not blind,\r\n      can this same Necessary of life be forwarded by the Flanders\r\n      Carriers,—never to get to hand.[370] All which, you would say,\r\n      augurs ill for the prospering of the enterprise. But the whims of\r\n      women and queens must be humoured.\r\n\r\n      Bouillé, on his side, is making a fortified Camp at Montmédi;\r\n      gathering Royal-Allemand, and all manner of other German and true\r\n      French Troops thither, “to watch the Austrians.” His Majesty will\r\n      not cross the Frontiers, unless on compulsion. Neither shall the\r\n      Emigrants be much employed, hateful as they are to all\r\n      people.[371] Nor shall old war-god Broglie have any hand in the\r\n      business; but solely our brave Bouillé; to whom, on the day of\r\n      meeting, a Marshal’s Baton shall be delivered, by a rescued King,\r\n      amid the shouting of all the troops. In the meanwhile, Paris\r\n      being so suspicious, were it not perhaps good to write your\r\n      Foreign Ambassadors an ostensible Constitutional Letter; desiring\r\n      all Kings and men to take heed that King Louis loves the\r\n      Constitution, that he has voluntarily sworn, and does again\r\n      swear, to maintain the same, and will reckon those his enemies\r\n      who affect to say otherwise? Such a Constitutional circular is\r\n      despatched by Couriers, is communicated confidentially to the\r\n      Assembly, and printed in all Newspapers; with the finest\r\n      effect.[372] Simulation and dissimulation mingle extensively in\r\n      human affairs.\r\n\r\n      We observe, however, that Count Fersen is often using his Ticket\r\n      of Entry; which surely he has clear right to do. A gallant\r\n      Soldier and Swede, devoted to this fair Queen;—as indeed the\r\n      Highest Swede now is. Has not King Gustav, famed fiery _Chevalier\r\n      du Nord_, sworn himself, by the old laws of chivalry, her Knight?\r\n      He will descend on fire-wings, of Swedish musketry, and deliver\r\n      her from these foul dragons,—if, alas, the assassin’s pistol\r\n      intervene not!\r\n\r\n      But, in fact, Count Fersen does seem a likely young soldier, of\r\n      alert decisive ways: he circulates widely, seen, unseen; and has\r\n      business on hand. Also Colonel the Duke de Choiseul, nephew of\r\n      Choiseul the great, of Choiseul the now deceased; he and Engineer\r\n      Goguelat are passing and repassing between Metz and the\r\n      Tuileries; and Letters go in cipher,—one of them, a most\r\n      important one, hard to _de_cipher; Fersen having ciphered it in\r\n      haste.[373] As for Duke de Villequier, he is gone ever since the\r\n      Day of Poniards; but his Apartment is useful for her Majesty.\r\n\r\n      On the other side, poor Commandment Gouvion, watching at the\r\n      Tuileries, second in National Command, sees several things hard\r\n      to interpret. It is the same Gouvion who sat, long months ago, at\r\n      the Townhall, gazing helpless into that Insurrection of Women;\r\n      motionless, as the brave stabled steed when conflagration rises,\r\n      till Usher Maillard snatched his drum. Sincerer Patriot there is\r\n      not; but many a shiftier. He, if Dame Campan gossip credibly, is\r\n      paying some similitude of love-court to a certain false\r\n      Chambermaid of the Palace, who betrays much to him: the\r\n      _Nécessaire_, the clothes, the packing of the jewels,[374]—could\r\n      he understand it when betrayed. Helpless Gouvion gazes with\r\n      sincere glassy eyes into it; stirs up his sentries to vigilence;\r\n      walks restless to and fro; and hopes the best.\r\n\r\n      But, on the whole, one finds that, in the second week of June,\r\n      Colonel de Choiseul is privately in Paris; having come “to see\r\n      his children.” Also that Fersen has got a stupendous new Coach\r\n      built, of the kind named _Berline;_ done by the first artists;\r\n      according to a model: they bring it home to him, in Choiseul’s\r\n      presence; the two friends take a proof-drive in it, along the\r\n      streets; in meditative mood; then send it up to “Madame\r\n      Sullivan’s, in the Rue de Clichy,” far North, to wait there till\r\n      wanted. Apparently a certain Russian Baroness de Korff, with\r\n      Waiting-woman, Valet, and two Children, will travel homewards\r\n      with some state: in whom these young military gentlemen take\r\n      interest? A Passport has been procured for her; and much\r\n      assistance shewn, with Coach-builders and such like;—so helpful\r\n      polite are young military men. Fersen has likewise purchased a\r\n      Chaise fit for two, at least for two waiting-maids; further,\r\n      certain necessary horses: one would say, he is himself quitting\r\n      France, not without outlay? We observe finally that their\r\n      Majesties, Heaven willing, will assist at _Corpus-Christi Day_,\r\n      this blessed Summer Solstice, in Assumption Church, here at\r\n      Paris, to the joy of all the world. For which same day, moreover,\r\n      brave Bouillé, at Metz, as we find, has invited a party of\r\n      friends to dinner; but indeed is gone from home, in the interim,\r\n      over to Montmédi.\r\n\r\n      These are of the Phenomena, or visual Appearances, of this\r\n      wide-working terrestrial world: which truly is all phenomenal,\r\n      what they call spectral; and never rests at any moment; one never\r\n      at any moment can know why.\r\n\r\n      On Monday night, the Twentieth of June 1791, about eleven\r\n      o’clock, there is many a hackney-coach, and glass-coach\r\n      (_carrosse de remise_), still rumbling, or at rest, on the\r\n      streets of Paris. But of all Glass-coaches, we recommend this to\r\n      thee, O Reader, which stands drawn up, in the Rue de l’Echelle,\r\n      hard by the Carrousel and outgate of the Tuileries; in the Rue de\r\n      l’Echelle that then was; “opposite Ronsin the saddler’s door,” as\r\n      if waiting for a fare there! Not long does it wait: a hooded\r\n      Dame, with two hooded Children has issued from Villequier’s door,\r\n      where no sentry walks, into the Tuileries Court-of-Princes; into\r\n      the Carrousel; into the Rue de l’Echelle; where the\r\n      Glass-coachman readily admits them; and again waits. Not long;\r\n      another Dame, likewise hooded or shrouded, leaning on a servant,\r\n      issues in the same manner, by the Glass-coachman, cheerfully\r\n      admitted. Whither go, so many Dames? ’Tis His Majesty’s\r\n      _Couchée_, Majesty just gone to bed, and all the Palace-world is\r\n      retiring home. But the Glass-coachman still waits; his fare\r\n      seemingly incomplete.\r\n\r\n      By and by, we note a thickset Individual, in round hat and\r\n      peruke, arm-and-arm with some servant, seemingly of the Runner or\r\n      Courier sort; he also issues through Villequier’s door; starts a\r\n      shoebuckle as he passes one of the sentries, stoops down to clasp\r\n      it again; is however, by the Glass-coachman, still more\r\n      cheerfully admitted. And _now_, is his fare complete? Not yet;\r\n      the Glass-coachman still waits.—Alas! and the false Chambermaid\r\n      has warned Gouvion that she thinks the Royal Family will fly this\r\n      very night; and Gouvion distrusting his own glazed eyes, has sent\r\n      express for Lafayette; and Lafayette’s Carriage, flaring with\r\n      lights, rolls this moment through the inner Arch of the\r\n      Carrousel,—where a Lady shaded in broad gypsy-hat, and leaning on\r\n      the arm of a servant, also of the Runner or Courier sort, stands\r\n      aside to let it pass, and has even the whim to touch a spoke of\r\n      it with her _badine_,—light little magic rod which she calls\r\n      _badine_, such as the Beautiful then wore. The flare of\r\n      Lafayette’s Carriage, rolls past: all is found quiet in the\r\n      Court-of-Princes; sentries at their post; Majesties’ Apartments\r\n      closed in smooth rest. Your false Chambermaid must have been\r\n      mistaken? Watch thou, Gouvion, with Argus’ vigilance; for, of a\r\n      truth, treachery is within these walls.\r\n\r\n      But where is the Lady that stood aside in gypsy hat, and touched\r\n      the wheel-spoke with her _badine?_ O Reader, that Lady that\r\n      touched the wheel-spoke was the Queen of France! She has issued\r\n      safe through that inner Arch, into the Carrousel itself; but not\r\n      into the Rue de l’Echelle. Flurried by the rattle and rencounter,\r\n      she took the right hand not the left; neither she nor her Courier\r\n      knows Paris; he indeed is no Courier, but a loyal stupid\r\n      _ci-devant_ Bodyguard disguised as one. They are off, quite\r\n      wrong, over the Pont Royal and River; roaming disconsolate in the\r\n      Rue du Bac; far from the Glass-coachman, who still waits. Waits,\r\n      with flutter of heart; with thoughts—which he must button close\r\n      up, under his jarvie surtout!\r\n\r\n      Midnight clangs from all the City-steeples; one precious hour has\r\n      been spent so; most mortals are asleep. The Glass-coachman waits;\r\n      and what mood! A brother jarvie drives up, enters into\r\n      conversation; is answered cheerfully in jarvie dialect: the\r\n      brothers of the whip exchange a pinch of snuff;[375] decline\r\n      drinking together; and part with good night. Be the Heavens\r\n      blest! here at length is the Queen-lady, in gypsy-hat; safe after\r\n      perils; who has had to inquire her way. She too is admitted; her\r\n      Courier jumps aloft, as the other, who is also a disguised\r\n      Bodyguard, has done: and now, O Glass-coachman of a\r\n      thousand,—Count Fersen, for the Reader sees it is thou,—drive!\r\n\r\n      Dust shall not stick to the hoofs of Fersen: crack! crack! the\r\n      Glass-coach rattles, and every soul breathes lighter. But is\r\n      Fersen on the right road? Northeastward, to the Barrier of\r\n      Saint-Martin and Metz Highway, thither were we bound: and lo, he\r\n      drives right Northward! The royal Individual, in round hat and\r\n      peruke, sits astonished; but right or wrong, there is no remedy.\r\n      Crack, crack, we go incessant, through the slumbering City.\r\n      Seldom, since Paris rose out of mud, or the Longhaired Kings went\r\n      in Bullock-carts, was there such a drive. Mortals on each hand of\r\n      you, close by, stretched out horizontal, dormant; and we alive\r\n      and quaking! Crack, crack, through the Rue de Grammont; across\r\n      the Boulevard; up the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin,—these windows,\r\n      all silent, of Number 42, were Mirabeau’s. Towards the Barrier\r\n      not of Saint-Martin, but of Clichy on the utmost North! Patience,\r\n      ye royal Individuals; Fersen understands what he is about.\r\n      Passing up the Rue de Clichy, he alights for one moment at Madame\r\n      Sullivan’s: ‘Did Count Fersen’s Coachman get the Baroness de\r\n      Korff’s new Berline?’—‘Gone with it an hour-and-half ago,’\r\n      grumbles responsive the drowsy Porter.—‘_C’est bien_.’ Yes, it is\r\n      well;—though had not such hour-and half been _lost_, it were\r\n      still better. Forth therefore, O Fersen, fast, by the Barrier de\r\n      Clichy; then Eastward along the Outward Boulevard, what horses\r\n      and whipcord can do!\r\n\r\n      Thus Fersen drives, through the ambrosial night. Sleeping Paris\r\n      is now all on the right hand of him; silent except for some\r\n      snoring hum; and now he is Eastward as far as the Barrier de\r\n      Saint-Martin; looking earnestly for Baroness de Korff’s Berline.\r\n      This Heaven’s Berline he at length does descry, drawn up with its\r\n      six horses, his own German Coachman waiting on the box. Right,\r\n      thou good German: now haste, whither thou knowest!—And as for us\r\n      of the Glass-coach, haste too, O haste; much time is already\r\n      lost! The august Glass-coach fare, six Insides, hastily packs\r\n      itself into the new Berline; two Bodyguard Couriers behind. The\r\n      Glass-coach itself is turned adrift, its head towards the City;\r\n      to wander whither it lists,—and be found next morning tumbled in\r\n      a ditch. But Fersen is on the new box, with its brave new\r\n      hammer-cloths; flourishing his whip; he bolts forward towards\r\n      Bondy. There a third and final Bodyguard Courier of ours ought\r\n      surely to be, with post-horses ready-ordered. There likewise\r\n      ought that purchased Chaise, with the two Waiting-maids and their\r\n      bandboxes to be; whom also her Majesty could not travel without.\r\n      Swift, thou deft Fersen, and may the Heavens turn it well!\r\n\r\n      Once more, by Heaven’s blessing, it is all well. Here is the\r\n      sleeping Hamlet of Bondy; Chaise with Waiting-women; horses all\r\n      ready, and postillions with their churn-boots, impatient in the\r\n      dewy dawn. Brief harnessing done, the postillions with their\r\n      churn-boots vault into the saddles; brandish circularly their\r\n      little noisy whips. Fersen, under his jarvie-surtout, bends in\r\n      lowly silent reverence of adieu; royal hands wave speechless in\r\n      expressible response; Baroness de Korff’s Berline, with the\r\n      Royalty of France, bounds off: for ever, as it proved. Deft\r\n      Fersen dashes obliquely Northward, through the country, towards\r\n      Bougret; gains Bougret, finds his German Coachman and chariot\r\n      waiting there; cracks off, and drives undiscovered into unknown\r\n      space. A deft active man, we say; what he undertook to do is\r\n      nimbly and successfully done.\r\n\r\n      And so the Royalty of France is actually fled? This precious\r\n      night, the shortest of the year, it flies and drives! _Baroness\r\n      de Korff_ is, at bottom, Dame de Tourzel, Governess of the Royal\r\n      Children: she who came hooded with the two hooded little ones;\r\n      little Dauphin; little Madame Royale, known long afterwards as\r\n      Duchess d’Angouleme. Baroness de Korff’s _Waiting-maid_ is the\r\n      Queen in gypsy-hat. The royal Individual in round hat and peruke,\r\n      he is _Valet_, for the time being. That other hooded Dame, styled\r\n      _Travelling-companion_, is kind Sister Elizabeth; she had sworn,\r\n      long since, when the Insurrection of Women was, that only death\r\n      should part her and them. And so they rush there, not too\r\n      impetuously, through the Wood of Bondy:—over a Rubicon in their\r\n      own and France’s History.\r\n\r\n      Great; though the future is all vague! If we reach Bouillé? If we\r\n      do not reach him? O Louis! and this all round thee is the great\r\n      slumbering Earth (and overhead, the great watchful Heaven); the\r\n      slumbering Wood of Bondy,—where Longhaired Childeric Donothing\r\n      was struck through with iron;[376] not unreasonably. These peaked\r\n      stone-towers are Raincy; towers of wicked d’Orléans. All slumbers\r\n      save the multiplex rustle of our new Berline. Loose-skirted\r\n      scarecrow of an Herb-merchant, with his ass and early greens,\r\n      toilsomely plodding, seems the only creature we meet. But right\r\n      ahead the great North-East sends up evermore his gray brindled\r\n      dawn: from dewy branch, birds here and there, with short deep\r\n      warble, salute the coming Sun. Stars fade out, and Galaxies;\r\n      Street-lamps of the City of God. The Universe, O my brothers, is\r\n      flinging wide its portals for the Levee of the GREAT HIGH KING.\r\n      Thou, poor King Louis, farest nevertheless, as mortals do,\r\n      towards Orient lands of Hope; and the Tuileries with _its_\r\n      Levees, and France and the Earth itself, is but a larger kind of\r\n      doghutch,—occasionally going rabid.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.IV.\r\n      Attitude.\r\n\r\n      But in Paris, at six in the morning; when some Patriot Deputy,\r\n      warned by a billet, awoke Lafayette, and they went to the\r\n      Tuileries?—Imagination may paint, but words cannot, the surprise\r\n      of Lafayette; or with what bewilderment helpless Gouvion rolled\r\n      glassy Argus’s eyes, discerning now that his false Chambermaid\r\n      told true!\r\n\r\n      However, it is to be recorded that Paris, thanks to an august\r\n      National Assembly, did, on this seeming doomsday, surpass itself.\r\n      Never, according to Historian eye-witnesses, was there seen such\r\n      an “imposing attitude.”[377] Sections all “in permanence;” our\r\n      Townhall, too, having first, about ten o’clock, fired three\r\n      solemn alarm-cannons: above all, our National Assembly! National\r\n      Assembly, likewise permanent, decides what is needful; with\r\n      unanimous consent, for the _Côté Droit_ sits dumb, afraid of the\r\n      Lanterne. Decides with a calm promptitude, which rises towards\r\n      the sublime. One must needs vote, for the thing is self-evident,\r\n      that his Majesty has been _abducted_, or spirited away,\r\n      “_enlevé_,” by some person or persons unknown: in which case,\r\n      what will the Constitution have us do? Let us return to first\r\n      principles, as we always say; ‘_revenons aux principes_.’\r\n\r\n      By first or by second principles, much is promptly decided:\r\n      Ministers are sent for, instructed how to continue their\r\n      functions; Lafayette is examined; and Gouvion, who gives a most\r\n      helpless account, the best he can. Letters are found written: one\r\n      Letter, of immense magnitude; all in his Majesty’s hand, and\r\n      evidently of his Majesty’s own composition; addressed to the\r\n      National Assembly. It details, with earnestness, with a childlike\r\n      simplicity, what woes his Majesty has suffered. Woes great and\r\n      small: A Necker seen applauded, a Majesty not; then insurrection;\r\n      want of due cash in Civil List; _general_ want of cash, furniture\r\n      and order; anarchy everywhere; Deficit never yet, in the\r\n      smallest, “choked or _comblé:_”—wherefore in brief His Majesty\r\n      has retired towards a Place of Liberty; and, leaving Sanctions,\r\n      Federation, and what Oaths there may be, to shift for themselves,\r\n      does now refer—to what, thinks an august Assembly? To that\r\n      “Declaration of the Twenty-third of June,” with its ‘_Seul il\r\n      fera_, He alone will make his People happy.’ As if _that_ were\r\n      not buried, deep enough, under two irrevocable Twelvemonths, and\r\n      the wreck and rubbish of a whole Feudal World! This strange\r\n      autograph Letter the National Assembly decides on printing; on\r\n      transmitting to the Eighty-three Departments, with exegetic\r\n      commentary, short but pithy. Commissioners also shall go forth on\r\n      all sides; the People be exhorted; the Armies be increased; care\r\n      taken that the Commonweal suffer no damage.—And now, with a\r\n      sublime air of calmness, nay of indifference, we “pass to the\r\n      order of the day!”\r\n\r\n      By such sublime calmness, the terror of the People is calmed.\r\n      These gleaming Pike forests, which bristled fateful in the early\r\n      sun, disappear again; the far-sounding Street-orators cease, or\r\n      spout milder. We are to have a civil war; let us have it then.\r\n      The King is gone; but National Assembly, but France and we\r\n      remain. The People also takes a great attitude; the People also\r\n      is calm; motionless as a couchant lion. With but a few\r\n      _broolings_, some waggings of the tail; to shew what it _will_\r\n      do! Cazalès, for instance, was beset by street-groups, and cries\r\n      of _Lanterne;_ but National Patrols easily delivered him.\r\n      Likewise all King’s effigies and statues, at least stucco ones,\r\n      get abolished. Even King’s names; the word Roi fades suddenly out\r\n      of all shop-signs; the Royal Bengal Tiger itself, on the\r\n      Boulevards, becomes the National Bengal one, _Tigre\r\n      National_.[378]\r\n\r\n      How great is a calm couchant People! On the morrow, men will say\r\n      to one another: ‘We have no King, yet we slept sound enough.’ On\r\n      the morrow, fervent Achille de Chatelet, and Thomas Paine the\r\n      rebellious Needleman, shall have the walls of Paris profusely\r\n      plastered with their Placard; announcing that there must be a\r\n      _Republic!_[379]—Need we add that Lafayette too, though at first\r\n      menaced by Pikes, has taken a great attitude, or indeed the\r\n      greatest of all? Scouts and Aides-de-camp fly forth, vague, in\r\n      quest and pursuit; young Romœuf towards Valenciennes, though with\r\n      small hope.\r\n\r\n      Thus Paris; sublimely calmed, in its bereavement. But from the\r\n      _Messageries Royales_, in all Mail-bags, radiates forth\r\n      far-darting the electric news: Our Hereditary Representative is\r\n      flown. Laugh, black Royalists: yet be it in your sleeve only;\r\n      lest Patriotism notice, and waxing frantic, lower the Lanterne!\r\n      In Paris alone is a sublime National Assembly with its calmness;\r\n      truly, other places must take it as they can: with open mouth and\r\n      eyes; with panic cackling, with wrath, with conjecture. How each\r\n      one of those dull leathern Diligences, with its leathern bag and\r\n      “The King is fled,” furrows up smooth France as it goes; through\r\n      town and hamlet, ruffles the smooth public mind into quivering\r\n      agitation of death-terror; then lumbers on, as if nothing had\r\n      happened! Along all highways; towards the utmost borders; till\r\n      all France is ruffled,—roughened up (metaphorically speaking)\r\n      into one enormous, desperate-minded, red-guggling Turkey Cock!\r\n\r\n      For example, it is under cloud of night that the leathern Monster\r\n      reaches Nantes; deep sunk in sleep. The word spoken rouses all\r\n      Patriot men: General Dumouriez, enveloped in roquelaures, has to\r\n      descend from his bedroom; finds the street covered with “four or\r\n      five thousand citizens in their shirts.”[380] Here and there a\r\n      faint farthing rushlight, hastily kindled; and so many\r\n      swart-featured haggard faces, with nightcaps pushed back; and the\r\n      more or less flowing drapery of night-shirt: open-mouthed till\r\n      the General say his word! And overhead, as always, the Great Bear\r\n      is turning so quiet round Boötes; steady, indifferent as the\r\n      leathern Diligence itself. Take comfort, ye men of Nantes: Boötes\r\n      and the steady Bear are turning; ancient Atlantic still sends his\r\n      brine, loud-billowing, up your Loire-stream; brandy shall be hot\r\n      in the stomach: this is not the Last of the Days, but one before\r\n      the Last.—The fools! If they knew what was doing, in these very\r\n      instants, also by candle-light, in the far North-East!\r\n\r\n      Perhaps we may say the most terrified man in Paris or France\r\n      is—who thinks the Reader?—seagreen Robespierre. Double paleness,\r\n      with the shadow of gibbets and halters, overcasts the seagreen\r\n      features: it is too clear to him that there is to be “a\r\n      Saint-Bartholomew of Patriots,” that in four-and-twenty hours he\r\n      will not be in life. These horrid anticipations of the soul he is\r\n      heard uttering at Pétion’s; by a notable witness. By Madame\r\n      Roland, namely; her whom we saw, last year, radiant at the Lyons\r\n      Federation! These four months, the Rolands have been in Paris;\r\n      arranging with Assembly Committees the Municipal affairs of\r\n      Lyons, affairs all sunk in debt;—communing, the while, as was\r\n      most natural, with the best Patriots to be found here, with our\r\n      Brissots, Pétions, Buzots, Robespierres; who were wont to come to\r\n      us, says the fair Hostess, four evenings in the week. They,\r\n      running about, busier than ever this day, would fain have\r\n      comforted the seagreen man: spake of Achille du Chatelet’s\r\n      Placard; of a Journal to be called _The Republican;_ of preparing\r\n      men’s minds for a Republic. ‘A Republic?’ said the Seagreen, with\r\n      one of his dry husky _un_sportful laughs, ‘What is that?’[381] O\r\n      seagreen Incorruptible, thou shalt see!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.V.\r\n      The New Berline.\r\n\r\n      But scouts all this while and aide-de-camps, have flown forth\r\n      faster than the leathern Diligences. Young Romœuf, as we said,\r\n      was off early towards Valenciennes: distracted Villagers seize\r\n      him, as a traitor with a finger of his own in the plot; drag him\r\n      back to the Townhall; to the National Assembly, which speedily\r\n      grants a new passport. Nay now, that same scarecrow of an\r\n      Herb-merchant with his ass has bethought him of the grand new\r\n      Berline seen in the Wood of Bondy; and delivered evidence of\r\n      it:[382] Romœuf, furnished with new passport, is sent forth with\r\n      double speed on a hopefuller track; by Bondy, Claye, and Châlons,\r\n      towards Metz, to track the new Berline; and gallops _à franc\r\n      étrier_.\r\n\r\n      Miserable new Berline! Why could not Royalty go in some old\r\n      Berline similar to that of other men? Flying for life, one does\r\n      not stickle about his vehicle. Monsieur, in a commonplace\r\n      travelling-carriage is off Northwards; Madame, his Princess, in\r\n      another, with variation of route: they cross one another while\r\n      changing horses, without look of recognition; and reach Flanders,\r\n      no man questioning them. Precisely in the same manner, beautiful\r\n      Princess de Lamballe set off, about the same hour; and will reach\r\n      England safe:—would she had continued there! The beautiful, the\r\n      good, but the unfortunate; reserved for a frightful end!\r\n\r\n      All runs along, unmolested, speedy, except only the new Berline.\r\n      Huge leathern vehicle;—huge Argosy, let us say, or Acapulco-ship;\r\n      with its heavy stern-boat of Chaise-and-pair; with its three\r\n      yellow Pilot-boats of mounted Bodyguard Couriers, rocking aimless\r\n      round it and ahead of it, to bewilder, not to guide! It lumbers\r\n      along, lurchingly with stress, at a snail’s pace; noted of all\r\n      the world. The Bodyguard Couriers, in their yellow liveries, go\r\n      prancing and clattering; loyal but stupid; unacquainted with all\r\n      things. Stoppages occur; and breakages to be repaired at Etoges.\r\n      King Louis too will dismount, will walk up hills, and enjoy the\r\n      blessed sunshine:—with eleven horses and double drink money, and\r\n      all furtherances of Nature and Art, it will be found that\r\n      Royalty, flying for life, accomplishes Sixty-nine miles in\r\n      Twenty-two incessant hours. Slow Royalty! And yet not a minute of\r\n      these hours but is precious: on minutes hang the destinies of\r\n      Royalty now.\r\n\r\n      Readers, therefore, can judge in what humour Duke de Choiseul\r\n      might stand waiting, in the Village of Pont-de-Sommevelle, some\r\n      leagues beyond Chalons, hour after hour, now when the day bends\r\n      visibly westward. Choiseul drove out of Paris, in all privity,\r\n      ten hours before their Majesties’ fixed time; his Hussars, led by\r\n      Engineer Goguelat, are here duly, come “to escort a Treasure that\r\n      is expected:” but, hour after hour, is no Baroness de Korff’s\r\n      Berline. Indeed, over all that North-east Region, on the skirts\r\n      of Champagne and of Lorraine, where the Great Road runs, the\r\n      agitation is considerable. For all along, from this\r\n      Pont-de-Sommevelle Northeastward as far as Montmédi, at\r\n      Post-villages and Towns, escorts of Hussars and Dragoons do\r\n      lounge waiting: a train or chain of Military Escorts; at the\r\n      Montmédi end of it our brave Bouillé: an electric thunder-chain;\r\n      which the invisible Bouillé, like a Father Jove, holds in his\r\n      hand—for wise purposes! Brave Bouillé has done what man could;\r\n      has spread out his electric thunder-chain of Military Escorts,\r\n      onwards to the threshold of Chalons: it waits but for the new\r\n      Korff Berline; to receive it, escort it, and, if need be, bear it\r\n      off in whirlwind of military fire. They lie and lounge there, we\r\n      say, these fierce Troopers; from Montmédi and Stenai, through\r\n      Clermont, Sainte-Menehould to utmost Pont-de-Sommevelle, in all\r\n      Post-villages; for the route shall avoid Verdun and great Towns:\r\n      they loiter impatient “till the Treasure arrive.”\r\n\r\n      Judge what a day this is for brave Bouillé: perhaps the first day\r\n      of a new glorious life; surely the last day of the old! Also, and\r\n      indeed still more, what a day, beautiful and terrible, for your\r\n      young full-blooded Captains: your Dandoins, Comte de Damas, Duke\r\n      de Choiseul, Engineer Goguelat, and the like; entrusted with the\r\n      secret!—Alas, the day bends ever more westward; and no Korff\r\n      Berline comes to sight. It is four hours beyond the time, and\r\n      still no Berline. In all Village-streets, Royalist Captains go\r\n      lounging, looking often Paris-ward; with face of unconcern, with\r\n      heart full of black care: rigorous Quartermasters can hardly keep\r\n      the private dragoons from _cafés_ and dramshops.[383] Dawn on our\r\n      bewilderment, thou new Berline; dawn on us, thou Sun-chariot of a\r\n      new Berline, with the destinies of France!\r\n\r\n      It was of His Majesty’s ordering, this military array of Escorts:\r\n      a thing solacing the Royal imagination with a look of security\r\n      and rescue; yet, in reality, creating only alarm, and where there\r\n      was otherwise no danger, danger without end. For each Patriot, in\r\n      these Post-villages, asks naturally: This clatter of cavalry, and\r\n      marching and lounging of troops, what means it? To escort a\r\n      Treasure? Why escort, when no Patriot will steal from the Nation;\r\n      or where is your Treasure?—There has been such marching and\r\n      counter-marching: for it is another fatality, that certain of\r\n      these Military Escorts came out so early as yesterday; the\r\n      Nineteenth not the Twentieth of the month being the day _first_\r\n      appointed, which her Majesty, for some necessity or other, saw\r\n      good to alter. And now consider the suspicious nature of\r\n      Patriotism; suspicious, above all, of Bouillé the Aristocrat; and\r\n      how the sour doubting humour has had leave to accumulate and\r\n      exacerbate for four-and-twenty hours!\r\n\r\n      At Pont-de-Sommevelle, these Forty foreign Hussars of Goguelat\r\n      and Duke Choiseul are becoming an unspeakable mystery to all men.\r\n      They lounged long enough, already, at Sainte-Menehould; lounged\r\n      and loitered till our National Volunteers there, all risen into\r\n      hot wrath of doubt, “demanded three hundred fusils of their\r\n      Townhall,” and got them. At which same moment too, as it chanced,\r\n      our Captain Dandoins was just coming in, from Clermont with _his_\r\n      troop, at the other end of the Village. A fresh troop; alarming\r\n      enough; though happily they are only Dragoons and French! So that\r\n      Goguelat with his Hussars had to ride, and even to do it fast;\r\n      till here at Pont-de-Sommevelle, where Choiseul lay waiting, he\r\n      found resting-place. Resting-place, as on burning marle. For the\r\n      rumour of him flies abroad; and men run to and fro in fright and\r\n      anger: Chalons sends forth exploratory pickets, coming from\r\n      Sainte-Menehould, on that. What is it, ye whiskered Hussars, men\r\n      of foreign guttural speech; in the name of Heaven, what is it\r\n      that brings you? A Treasure?—exploratory pickets shake their\r\n      heads. The hungry Peasants, however, know too well what Treasure\r\n      it is: Military seizure for rents, feudalities; which no Bailiff\r\n      could make us pay! This they know;—and set to jingling their\r\n      Parish-bell by way of tocsin; with rapid effect! Choiseul and\r\n      Goguelat, if the whole country is not to take fire, must needs,\r\n      be there Berline, be there no Berline, saddle and ride.\r\n\r\n      They mount; and this Parish tocsin happily ceases. They ride\r\n      slowly Eastward, towards Sainte-Menehould; still hoping the\r\n      Sun-Chariot of a Berline may overtake them. Ah me, no Berline!\r\n      And near now is that Sainte-Menehould, which expelled us in the\r\n      morning, with its “three hundred National fusils;” which looks,\r\n      belike, not too lovingly on Captain Dandoins and his fresh\r\n      Dragoons, though only French;—which, in a word, one dare not\r\n      enter the _second_ time, under pain of explosion! With rather\r\n      heavy heart, our Hussar Party strikes off to the left; through\r\n      byways, through pathless hills and woods, they, avoiding\r\n      Sainte-Menehould and all places which have seen them heretofore,\r\n      will make direct for the distant Village of Varennes. It is\r\n      probable they will have a rough evening-ride.\r\n\r\n      This first military post, therefore, in the long thunder-chain,\r\n      has gone off with no effect; or with worse, and your chain\r\n      threatens to entangle itself!—The Great Road, however, is got\r\n      hushed again into a kind of quietude, though one of the\r\n      wakefullest. Indolent Dragoons cannot, by any Quartermaster, be\r\n      kept altogether from the dramshop; where Patriots drink, and will\r\n      even treat, eager enough for news. Captains, in a state near\r\n      distraction, beat the dusky highway, with a face of indifference;\r\n      and no Sun-Chariot appears. Why lingers it? Incredible, that with\r\n      eleven horses and such yellow Couriers and furtherances, its rate\r\n      should be under the weightiest dray-rate, some three miles an\r\n      hour! Alas, one knows not whether it ever even got out of\r\n      Paris;—and yet also one knows not whether, this very moment, it\r\n      is not at the Village-end! One’s heart flutters on the verge of\r\n      unutterabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.VI.\r\n      Old-Dragoon Drouet.\r\n\r\n      In this manner, however, has the Day bent downwards. Wearied\r\n      mortals are creeping home from their field-labour; the\r\n      village-artisan eats with relish his supper of herbs, or has\r\n      strolled forth to the village-street for a sweet mouthful of air\r\n      and human news. Still summer-eventide everywhere! The great Sun\r\n      hangs flaming on the utmost North-West; for it is his longest day\r\n      this year. The hill-tops rejoicing will ere long be at their\r\n      ruddiest, and blush Good-night. The thrush, in green dells, on\r\n      long-shadowed leafy spray, pours gushing his glad serenade, to\r\n      the babble of brooks grown audibler; silence is stealing over the\r\n      Earth. Your dusty Mill of Valmy, as all other mills and\r\n      drudgeries, may furl its canvass, and cease swashing and\r\n      circling. The swenkt grinders in this Treadmill of an Earth have\r\n      ground out another Day; and lounge there, as we say, in\r\n      village-groups; movable, or ranked on social stone-seats;[384]\r\n      their children, mischievous imps, sporting about their feet.\r\n      Unnotable hum of sweet human gossip rises from this Village of\r\n      Sainte-Menehould, as from all other villages. Gossip mostly\r\n      sweet, unnotable; for the very Dragoons are French and gallant;\r\n      nor as yet has the Paris-and-Verdun Diligence, with its leathern\r\n      bag, rumbled in, to terrify the minds of men.\r\n\r\n      One figure nevertheless we do note at the last door of the\r\n      Village: that figure in loose-flowing nightgown, of Jean Baptiste\r\n      Drouet, Master of the Post here. An acrid choleric man, rather\r\n      dangerous-looking; still in the prime of life, though he has\r\n      served, in his time as a Condé Dragoon. This day from an early\r\n      hour, Drouet got his choler stirred, and has been kept fretting.\r\n      Hussar Goguelat in the morning saw good, by way of thrift, to\r\n      bargain with his own Innkeeper, not with Drouet regular _Maître\r\n      de Poste_, about some gig-horse for the sending back of his gig;\r\n      which thing Drouet perceiving came over in red ire, menacing the\r\n      Inn-keeper, and would not be appeased. Wholly an unsatisfactory\r\n      day. For Drouet is an acrid Patriot too, was at the Paris Feast\r\n      of Pikes: and what do these Bouillé Soldiers mean? Hussars, with\r\n      their gig, and a vengeance to it!—have hardly been thrust out,\r\n      when Dandoins and his fresh Dragoons arrive from Clermont, and\r\n      stroll. For what purpose? Choleric Drouet steps out and steps in,\r\n      with long-flowing nightgown; looking abroad, with that sharpness\r\n      of faculty which stirred choler gives to man.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, mark Captain Dandoins on the street of that\r\n      same Village; sauntering with a face of indifference, a heart\r\n      eaten of black care! For no Korff Berline makes its appearance.\r\n      The great Sun flames broader towards setting: one’s heart\r\n      flutters on the verge of dread unutterabilities.\r\n\r\n      By Heaven! Here is the yellow Bodyguard Courier; spurring fast,\r\n      in the ruddy evening light! Steady, O Dandoins, stand with\r\n      inscrutable indifferent face; though the yellow blockhead spurs\r\n      past the Post-house; inquires to find it; and stirs the Village,\r\n      all delighted with his fine livery.—Lumbering along with its\r\n      mountains of bandboxes, and Chaise behind, the Korff Berline\r\n      rolls in; huge Acapulco-ship with its Cockboat, having got thus\r\n      far. The eyes of the Villagers look enlightened, as such eyes do\r\n      when a coach-transit, which is an event, occurs for them.\r\n      Strolling Dragoons respectfully, so fine are the yellow liveries,\r\n      bring hand to helmet; and a lady in gipsy-hat responds with a\r\n      grace peculiar to her.[385] Dandoins stands with folded arms, and\r\n      what look of indifference and disdainful garrison-air a man can,\r\n      while the heart is like leaping out of him. Curled disdainful\r\n      moustachio; careless glance,—which however surveys the\r\n      Village-groups, and does not like them. With his eye he bespeaks\r\n      the yellow Courier. Be quick, be quick! Thick-headed Yellow\r\n      cannot understand the eye; comes up mumbling, to ask in words:\r\n      seen of the Village!\r\n\r\n      Nor is Post-master Drouet unobservant, all this while; but steps\r\n      out and steps in, with his long-flowing nightgown, in the level\r\n      sunlight; prying into several things. When a man’s faculties, at\r\n      the right time, are sharpened by choler, it may lead to much.\r\n      That Lady in slouched gypsy-hat, though sitting back in the\r\n      Carriage, does she not resemble some one we have seen, some\r\n      time;—at the Feast of Pikes, or elsewhere? And this _Grosse-Tête_\r\n      in round hat and peruke, which, looking rearward, pokes itself\r\n      out from time to time, methinks there are features in it—? Quick,\r\n      Sieur Guillaume, Clerk of the _Directoire_, bring me a new\r\n      Assignat! Drouet scans the new Assignat; compares the Paper-money\r\n      Picture with the Gross-Head in round hat there: by Day and Night!\r\n      you might say the one was an attempted Engraving of the other.\r\n      And this march of Troops; this sauntering and whispering,—I see\r\n      it!\r\n\r\n      Drouet Post-master of this Village, hot Patriot, Old Dragoon of\r\n      Condé, consider, therefore, what thou wilt do. And fast: for\r\n      behold the new Berline, expeditiously yoked, cracks whipcord, and\r\n      rolls away!—Drouet dare not, on the spur of the instant, clutch\r\n      the bridles in his own two hands; Dandoins, with broadsword,\r\n      might hew you off. Our poor Nationals, not one of them here, have\r\n      three hundred fusils but then no powder; besides one is not sure,\r\n      only morally-certain. Drouet, as an adroit Old-Dragoon of Condé\r\n      does what is advisablest: privily bespeaks Clerk Guillaume,\r\n      Old-Dragoon of Condé he too; privily, while Clerk Guillaume is\r\n      saddling two of the fleetest horses, slips over to the Townhall\r\n      to whisper a word; then mounts with Clerk Guillaume; and the two\r\n      bound eastward in pursuit, to _see_ what can be done.\r\n\r\n      They bound eastward, in sharp trot; their moral-certainty\r\n      permeating the Village, from the Townhall outwards, in busy\r\n      whispers. Alas! Captain Dandoins orders his Dragoons to mount;\r\n      but they, complaining of long fast, demand bread-and-cheese\r\n      first;—before which brief repast can be eaten, the whole Village\r\n      is permeated; not whispering now, but blustering and shrieking!\r\n      National Volunteers, in hurried muster, shriek for gunpowder;\r\n      Dragoons halt between Patriotism and Rule of the Service, between\r\n      bread and cheese and fixed bayonets: Dandoins hands secretly his\r\n      Pocket-book, with its secret despatches, to the rigorous\r\n      Quartermaster: the very Ostlers have stable-forks and flails. The\r\n      rigorous Quartermaster, half-saddled, cuts out his way with the\r\n      sword’s edge, amid levelled bayonets, amid Patriot vociferations,\r\n      adjurations, flail-strokes; and rides frantic;[386]—few or even\r\n      none following him; the rest, so sweetly constrained consenting\r\n      to stay there.\r\n\r\n      And thus the new Berline rolls; and Drouet and Guillaume gallop\r\n      after it, and Dandoins’s Troopers or Trooper gallops after them;\r\n      and Sainte-Menehould, with some leagues of the King’s Highway, is\r\n      in explosion;—and your Military thunder-chain has gone off in a\r\n      self-destructive manner; one may fear with the frightfullest\r\n      issues!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.VII.\r\n      The Night of Spurs.\r\n\r\n      This comes of mysterious Escorts, and a new Berline with eleven\r\n      horses: “he that has a secret should not only hide it, but hide\r\n      that he has it to hide.” Your first Military Escort has exploded\r\n      self-destructive; and all Military Escorts, and a suspicious\r\n      Country will now be up, explosive; comparable _not_ to victorious\r\n      thunder. Comparable, say rather, to the first stirring of an\r\n      Alpine Avalanche; which, once stir it, as here at\r\n      Sainte-Menehould, will spread,—all round, and on and on, as far\r\n      as Stenai; thundering with wild ruin, till Patriot Villagers,\r\n      Peasantry, Military Escorts, new Berline and Royalty are\r\n      down,—jumbling in the Abyss!\r\n\r\n      The thick shades of Night are falling. Postillions crack the\r\n      whip: the Royal Berline is through Clermont, where Colonel Comte\r\n      de Damas got a word whispered to it; is safe through, towards\r\n      Varennes; rushing at the rate of double drink-money: an Unknown\r\n      “_Inconnu_ on horseback” shrieks earnestly some hoarse whisper,\r\n      not audible, into the rushing Carriage-window, and vanishes, left\r\n      in the night.[387] August Travellers palpitate; nevertheless\r\n      overwearied Nature sinks every one of them into a kind of sleep.\r\n      Alas, and Drouet and Clerk Guillaume spur; taking side-roads, for\r\n      shortness, for safety; scattering abroad that moral-certainty of\r\n      theirs; which flies, a bird of the air carrying it!\r\n\r\n      And your rigorous Quartermaster spurs; awakening hoarse\r\n      trumpet-tone, as here at Clermont, calling out Dragoons gone to\r\n      bed. Brave Colonel de Damas has them mounted, in part, these\r\n      Clermont men; young Cornet Remy dashes off with a few. But the\r\n      Patriot Magistracy is out here at Clermont too; National Guards\r\n      shrieking for ball-cartridges; and the Village “illuminates\r\n      itself;”—deft Patriots springing out of bed; alertly, in shirt or\r\n      shift, striking a light; sticking up each his farthing candle, or\r\n      penurious oil-cruise, till all glitters and glimmers; so deft are\r\n      they! A _camisado_, or shirt-tumult, every where: stormbell set\r\n      a-ringing; village-drum beating furious _générale_, as here at\r\n      Clermont, under illumination; distracted Patriots pleading and\r\n      menacing! Brave young Colonel de Damas, in that uproar of\r\n      distracted Patriotism, speaks some fire-sentences to what\r\n      Troopers he has: ‘Comrades insulted at Sainte-Menehould; King and\r\n      Country calling on the brave;’ then gives the fire-word, _Draw\r\n      swords_. Whereupon, alas, the Troopers only _smite_ their\r\n      sword-handles, driving them further home! ‘To me, whoever is for\r\n      the King!’ cries Damas in despair; and gallops, he with some poor\r\n      loyal Two, of the subaltern sort, into the bosom of the\r\n      Night.[388]\r\n\r\n      Night unexampled in the Clermontais; shortest of the year;\r\n      remarkablest of the century: Night deserving to be named of\r\n      Spurs! Cornet Remy, and those Few he dashed off with, has missed\r\n      his road; is galloping for hours towards Verdun; then, for hours,\r\n      across hedged country, through roused hamlets, towards Varennes.\r\n      Unlucky Cornet Remy; unluckier Colonel Damas, with whom there\r\n      ride desperate only some loyal Two! More ride not of that\r\n      Clermont Escort: of other Escorts, in other Villages, not even\r\n      Two may ride; but only all curvet and prance,—impeded by\r\n      stormbell and your Village illuminating itself.\r\n\r\n      And Drouet rides and Clerk Guillaume; and the Country\r\n      runs.—Goguelat and Duke Choiseul are plunging through morasses,\r\n      over cliffs, over stock and stone, in the shaggy woods of the\r\n      Clermontais; by tracks; or trackless, with guides; Hussars\r\n      tumbling into pitfalls, and lying “swooned three quarters of an\r\n      hour,” the rest refusing to march without them. What an\r\n      evening-ride from Pont-de-Sommerville; what a thirty hours, since\r\n      Choiseul quitted Paris, with Queen’s-valet Leonard in the chaise\r\n      by him! Black Care sits behind the rider. Thus go they plunging;\r\n      rustle the owlet from his branchy nest; champ the sweet-scented\r\n      forest-herb, queen-of-the-meadows _spilling_ her spikenard; and\r\n      frighten the ear of Night. But hark! towards twelve o’clock, as\r\n      one guesses, for the very stars are gone out: sound of the tocsin\r\n      from Varennes? Checking bridle, the Hussar Officer listens: ‘Some\r\n      fire undoubtedly!’—yet rides on, with double breathlessness, to\r\n      verify.\r\n\r\n      Yes, gallant friends that do your utmost, it is a certain sort of\r\n      fire: difficult to quench.—The Korff Berline, fairly ahead of all\r\n      this riding Avalanche, reached the little paltry Village of\r\n      Varennes about eleven o’clock; hopeful, in spite of that\r\n      horse-whispering Unknown. Do not all towns now lie behind us;\r\n      Verdun avoided, on our right? Within wind of Bouillé himself, in\r\n      a manner; and the darkest of midsummer nights favouring us! And\r\n      so we halt on the hill-top at the South end of the Village;\r\n      expecting our relay; which young Bouillé, Bouillé’s own son, with\r\n      his Escort of Hussars, was to have ready; for in this Village is\r\n      no Post. Distracting to think of: neither horse nor Hussar is\r\n      here! Ah, and stout horses, a proper relay belonging to Duke\r\n      Choiseul, do stand at hay, but in the Upper Village over the\r\n      Bridge; and we know not of them. Hussars likewise do wait, but\r\n      drinking in the taverns. For indeed it is six hours beyond the\r\n      time; young Bouillé, silly stripling, thinking the matter over\r\n      for this night, has retired to bed. And so our yellow Couriers,\r\n      inexperienced, must rove, groping, bungling, through a Village\r\n      mostly asleep: Postillions will not, for any money, go on with\r\n      the tired horses; not at least without refreshment; not they, let\r\n      the Valet in round hat argue as he likes.\r\n\r\n      Miserable! “For five-and-thirty minutes” by the King’s watch, the\r\n      Berline is at a dead stand; Round-hat arguing with Churnboots;\r\n      tired horses slobbering their meal-and-water; yellow Couriers\r\n      groping, bungling;—young Bouillé asleep, all the while, in the\r\n      Upper Village, and Choiseul’s fine team standing there at hay. No\r\n      help for it; not with a King’s ransom: the horses deliberately\r\n      slobber, Round-hat argues, Bouillé sleeps. And mark now, in the\r\n      thick night, do not two Horsemen, with jaded trot, come\r\n      clank-clanking; and start with half-pause, if one noticed them,\r\n      at sight of this dim mass of a Berline, and its dull slobbering\r\n      and arguing; then prick off faster, into the Village? It is\r\n      Drouet, he and Clerk Guillaume! Still ahead, they two, of the\r\n      whole riding hurlyburly; unshot, though some brag of having\r\n      chased them. Perilous is Drouet’s errand also; but he is an\r\n      Old-Dragoon, with his wits shaken thoroughly awake.\r\n\r\n      The Village of Varennes lies dark and slumberous; a most unlevel\r\n      Village, of inverse saddle-shape, as men write. It sleeps; the\r\n      rushing of the River Aire singing lullaby to it. Nevertheless\r\n      from the Golden Arms, _Bras d’Or_ Tavern, across that sloping\r\n      marketplace, there still comes shine of social light; comes voice\r\n      of rude drovers, or the like, who have not yet taken the\r\n      stirrup-cup; Boniface Le Blanc, in white apron, serving them:\r\n      cheerful to behold. To this _Bras d’Or_, Drouet enters, alacrity\r\n      looking through his eyes: he nudges Boniface, in all privacy,\r\n      ‘_Camarade, es-tu bon Patriote_, Art thou a good Patriot?’—‘_Si\r\n      je suis!_’ answers Boniface.—‘In that case,’ eagerly whispers\r\n      Drouet—what whisper is needful, heard of Boniface alone.[389]\r\n\r\n      And now see Boniface Le Blanc bustling, as he never did for the\r\n      jolliest toper. See Drouet and Guillaume, dexterous Old-Dragoons,\r\n      instantly down blocking the Bridge, with a “furniture waggon they\r\n      find there,” with whatever waggons, tumbrils, barrels, barrows\r\n      their hands can lay hold of;—till no carriage can pass. Then\r\n      swiftly, the Bridge once blocked, see them take station hard by,\r\n      under Varennes Archway: joined by Le Blanc, Le Blanc’s Brother,\r\n      and one or two alert Patriots he has roused. Some half-dozen in\r\n      all, with National Muskets, they stand close, waiting under the\r\n      Archway, till that same Korff Berline rumble up.\r\n\r\n      It rumbles up: _Alte là!_ lanterns flash out from under\r\n      coat-skirts, bridles chuck in strong fists, two National Muskets\r\n      level themselves fore and aft through the two Coach-doors:\r\n      ‘Mesdames, your Passports?’—Alas! Alas! Sieur Sausse, Procureur\r\n      of the Township, Tallow-chandler also and Grocer is there, with\r\n      official grocer-politeness; Drouet with fierce logic and ready\r\n      wit:—The respected Travelling Party, be it Baroness de Korff’s,\r\n      or persons of still higher consequence, will perhaps please to\r\n      rest itself in M. Sausse’s till the dawn strike up!\r\n\r\n      O Louis; O hapless Marie-Antoinette, fated to pass thy life with\r\n      such men! Phlegmatic Louis, art thou but lazy semi-animate phlegm\r\n      then, to the centre of thee? King, Captain-General, Sovereign\r\n      Frank! If thy heart ever formed, since it began beating under the\r\n      name of heart, any resolution at all, be it now then, or never in\r\n      this world: ‘Violent nocturnal individuals, and if it were\r\n      persons of high consequence? And if it were the King himself? Has\r\n      the King not the power, which all beggars have, of travelling\r\n      unmolested on his own Highway? Yes: it is the King; and tremble\r\n      ye to know it! The King has said, in this one small matter; and\r\n      in France, or under God’s Throne, is no power that shall gainsay.\r\n      Not the King shall ye stop here under this your miserable\r\n      Archway; but his dead body only, and answer it to Heaven and\r\n      Earth. To me, Bodyguards: Postillions, _en avant!_’—One fancies\r\n      in that case the pale paralysis of these two Le Blanc musketeers;\r\n      the drooping of Drouet’s under-jaw; and how Procureur Sausse had\r\n      melted like tallow in furnace-heat: Louis faring on; in some few\r\n      steps awakening Young Bouillé, awakening relays and hussars:\r\n      triumphant entry, with cavalcading high-brandishing Escort, and\r\n      Escorts, into Montmédi; and the whole course of French History\r\n      different!\r\n\r\n      Alas, it was not _in_ the poor phlegmatic man. Had it been in\r\n      him, French History had never come under this Varennes Archway to\r\n      decide itself.—He steps out; all step out. Procureur Sausse gives\r\n      his grocer-arms to the Queen and Sister Elizabeth; Majesty taking\r\n      the two children by the hand. And thus they walk, coolly back,\r\n      over the Marketplace, to Procureur Sausse’s; mount into his small\r\n      upper story; where straightway his Majesty “demands\r\n      refreshments.” Demands refreshments, as is written; gets\r\n      bread-and-cheese with a bottle of Burgundy; and remarks, that it\r\n      is the best Burgundy he ever drank!\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, the Varennes Notables, and all men, official, and\r\n      non-official, are hastily drawing on their breeches; getting\r\n      their fighting-gear. Mortals half-dressed tumble out barrels, lay\r\n      felled trees; scouts dart off to all the four winds,—the tocsin\r\n      begins clanging, “the Village illuminates itself.” Very singular:\r\n      how these little Villages do manage, so adroit are they, when\r\n      startled in midnight alarm of war. Like little adroit municipal\r\n      rattle-snakes, suddenly awakened: for their stormbell rattles and\r\n      rings; their eyes glisten luminous (with tallow-light), as in\r\n      rattle-snake ire; and the Village will _sting!_ Old-Dragoon\r\n      Drouet is our engineer and generalissimo; valiant as a Ruy\r\n      Diaz:—Now or never, ye Patriots, for the Soldiery is coming;\r\n      massacre by Austrians, by Aristocrats, wars more than civil, it\r\n      all depends on you and the hour!—National Guards rank themselves,\r\n      half-buttoned: mortals, we say, still only in breeches, in\r\n      under-petticoat, tumble out barrels and lumber, lay felled trees\r\n      for barricades: the Village will _sting_. Rabid Democracy, it\r\n      would seem, is _not_ confined to Paris, then? Ah no, whatsoever\r\n      Courtiers might talk; too clearly no. This of dying for one’s\r\n      King is grown into a dying for one’s self, _against_ the King, if\r\n      need be.\r\n\r\n      And so our riding and running Avalanche and Hurlyburly has\r\n      _reached_ the Abyss, Korff Berline foremost; and may pour itself\r\n      thither, and jumble: endless! For the next six hours, need we ask\r\n      if there was a clattering far and wide? Clattering and tocsining\r\n      and hot tumult, over all the Clermontais, spreading through the\r\n      Three Bishopricks: Dragoon and Hussar Troops galloping on roads\r\n      and no-roads; National Guards arming and starting in the dead of\r\n      night; tocsin after tocsin transmitting the alarm. In some forty\r\n      minutes, Goguelat and Choiseul, with their wearied Hussars, reach\r\n      Varennes. Ah, it is no fire then; or a fire difficult to quench!\r\n      They leap the tree-barricades, in spite of National serjeant;\r\n      they enter the village, Choiseul instructing his Troopers how the\r\n      matter really is; who respond interjectionally, in their guttural\r\n      dialect, ‘_Der König; die Königinn!_’ and seem stanch. These now,\r\n      in their stanch humour, will, for one thing, beset Procureur\r\n      Sausse’s house. Most beneficial: had not Drouet stormfully\r\n      ordered otherwise; and even bellowed, in his extremity,\r\n      ‘Cannoneers to your guns!’—two old honey-combed Field-pieces,\r\n      empty of all but cobwebs; the rattle whereof, as the Cannoneers\r\n      with assured countenance trundled them up, did nevertheless abate\r\n      the Hussar ardour, and produce a respectfuller ranking further\r\n      back. Jugs of wine, handed over the ranks, for the German throat\r\n      too has sensibility, will complete the business. When Engineer\r\n      Goguelat, some hour or so afterwards, steps forth, the response\r\n      to him is—a hiccuping _Vive la Nation!_\r\n\r\n      What boots it? Goguelat, Choiseul, now also Count Damas, and all\r\n      the Varennes Officiality are with the King; and the King can give\r\n      no order, form no opinion; but sits there, as he has ever done,\r\n      like clay on potter’s wheel; perhaps the absurdest of all\r\n      pitiable and pardonable clay-figures that now circle under the\r\n      Moon. He will go on, next morning, and take the National Guard\r\n      _with_ him; Sausse permitting! Hapless Queen: with her two\r\n      children laid there on the mean bed, old Mother Sausse kneeling\r\n      to Heaven, with tears and an audible prayer, to bless them;\r\n      imperial Marie-Antoinette near kneeling to Son Sausse and Wife\r\n      Sausse, amid candle-boxes and treacle-barrels,—in vain! There are\r\n      Three-thousand National Guards got in; before long they will\r\n      count Ten-thousand; tocsins spreading like fire on dry heath, or\r\n      far faster.\r\n\r\n      Young Bouillé, roused by this Varennes tocsin, has taken horse,\r\n      and—fled towards his Father. Thitherward also rides, in an almost\r\n      hysterically desperate manner, a certain Sieur Aubriot,\r\n      Choiseul’s Orderly; swimming dark rivers, our Bridge being\r\n      blocked; spurring as if the Hell-hunt were at his heels.[390]\r\n      Through the village of Dun, he, galloping still on, scatters the\r\n      alarm; at Dun, brave Captain Deslons and _his_ Escort of a\r\n      Hundred, saddle and ride. Deslons too gets into Varennes; leaving\r\n      his Hundred outside, at the tree-barricade; offers to cut King\r\n      Louis out, if he will order it: but unfortunately ‘the work\r\n      _will_ prove hot;’ whereupon King Louis has ‘no orders to\r\n      give.’[391]\r\n\r\n      And so the tocsin clangs, and Dragoons gallop; and can do\r\n      nothing, having gallopped: National Guards stream in like the\r\n      gathering of ravens: your exploding Thunder-chain, falling\r\n      Avalanche, or what else we liken it to, does play, with a\r\n      vengeance,—up now as far as Stenai and Bouillé himself.[392]\r\n      Brave Bouillé, son of the whirlwind, he saddles Royal Allemand;\r\n      speaks fire-words, kindling heart and eyes; distributes\r\n      twenty-five gold-louis a company:—Ride, Royal-Allemand,\r\n      long-famed: no Tuileries Charge and Necker-Orleans\r\n      Bust-Procession; a very King made captive, and world all to\r\n      win!—Such is the Night deserving to be named of Spurs.\r\n\r\n      At six o’clock two things have happened. Lafayette’s\r\n      Aide-de-camp, Romœuf, riding _à franc étrier_, on that old\r\n      Herb-merchant’s route, quickened during the last stages, has got\r\n      to Varennes; where the Ten thousand now furiously demand, with\r\n      fury of panic terror, that Royalty shall forthwith return\r\n      Paris-ward, that there be not infinite bloodshed. Also, on the\r\n      other side, “English Tom,” Choiseul’s _jokei_, flying with that\r\n      Choiseul relay, has met Bouillé on the heights of Dun; the\r\n      adamantine brow flushed with dark thunder; thunderous rattle of\r\n      Royal Allemand at his heels. English Tom answers as he can the\r\n      brief question, How it is at Varennes?—then asks in turn what he,\r\n      English Tom, with M. de Choiseul’s horses, is to do, and whither\r\n      to ride?—To the Bottomless Pool! answers a thunder-voice; then\r\n      again speaking and spurring, orders Royal Allemand to the gallop;\r\n      and vanishes, swearing (_en jurant_).[393] ’Tis the last of our\r\n      brave Bouillé. Within sight of Varennes, he having drawn bridle,\r\n      calls a council of officers; finds that it is in vain. King Louis\r\n      has departed, consenting: amid the clangour of universal\r\n      stormbell; amid the tramp of Ten thousand armed men, already\r\n      arrived; and say, of Sixty thousand flocking thither. Brave\r\n      Deslons, even without “orders,” darted at the River Aire with his\r\n      Hundred![394] swam one branch of it, could not the other; and\r\n      stood there, dripping and panting, with inflated nostril; the Ten\r\n      thousand answering him with a shout of mockery, the new Berline\r\n      lumbering Paris-ward its weary inevitable way. No help, then in\r\n      Earth; nor in an age, not of miracles, in Heaven!\r\n\r\n      That night, “Marquis de Bouillé and twenty-one more of us rode\r\n      over the Frontiers; the Bernardine monks at Orval in Luxemburg\r\n      gave us supper and lodging.”[395] With little of speech, Bouillé\r\n      rides; with thoughts that do not brook speech. Northward, towards\r\n      uncertainty, and the Cimmerian Night: towards West-Indian Isles,\r\n      for with thin Emigrant delirium the son of the whirlwind cannot\r\n      act; towards England, towards premature Stoical death; not\r\n      towards France any more. Honour to the Brave; who, be it in this\r\n      quarrel or in that, _is_ a substance and articulate-speaking\r\n      piece of Human Valour, not a fanfaronading hollow Spectrum and\r\n      squeaking and gibbering Shadow! One of the few Royalist\r\n      Chief-actors this Bouillé, of whom so much can be said.\r\n\r\n      The brave Bouillé too, then, vanishes from the tissue of our\r\n      Story. Story and tissue, faint ineffectual Emblem of that grand\r\n      Miraculous Tissue, and Living Tapestry named _French Revolution_,\r\n      which did weave itself then in very fact, “on the loud-sounding\r\n      “LOOM OF TIME!” The old Brave drop out from it, with their\r\n      strivings; and new acrid Drouets, of new strivings and colour,\r\n      come in:—as is the manner of that weaving.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.VIII.\r\n      The Return.\r\n\r\n      So then our grand Royalist Plot, of Flight to Metz, has\r\n      _executed_ itself. Long hovering in the background, as a dread\r\n      royal _ultimatum_, it has rushed forward in its terrors: verily\r\n      to some purpose. How many Royalist Plots and Projects, one after\r\n      another, cunningly-devised, that were to explode like\r\n      powder-mines and thunderclaps; not one solitary Plot of which has\r\n      issued otherwise! Powder-mine of a _Séance Royale_ on the\r\n      Twenty-third of June 1789, which exploded as we then said,\r\n      “through the touchhole;” which next, your wargod Broglie having\r\n      reloaded it, brought a Bastille about your ears. Then came\r\n      fervent Opera-Repast, with flourishing of sabres, and _O Richard,\r\n      O my King;_ which, aided by Hunger, produces Insurrection of\r\n      Women, and Pallas Athene in the shape of Demoiselle Théroigne.\r\n      Valour profits not; neither has fortune smiled on Fanfaronade.\r\n      The Bouillé Armament ends as the Broglie one had done. Man after\r\n      man spends himself in this cause, only to work it quicker ruin;\r\n      it seems a cause doomed, forsaken of Earth and Heaven.\r\n\r\n      On the Sixth of October gone a year, King Louis, escorted by\r\n      Demoiselle Théroigne and some two hundred thousand, made a Royal\r\n      Progress and Entrance into Paris, such as man had never\r\n      witnessed: we prophesied him Two more such; and accordingly\r\n      another of them, after this Flight to Metz, is now coming to\r\n      pass. Théroigne will not escort here, neither does Mirabeau now\r\n      “sit in one of the accompanying carriages.” Mirabeau lies dead,\r\n      in the Pantheon of Great Men. Théroigne lies living, in dark\r\n      Austrian Prison; having gone to Liège, professionally, and been\r\n      seized there. Bemurmured now by the hoarse-flowing Danube; the\r\n      light of her Patriot Supper-Parties gone quite out; so lies\r\n      Théroigne: she shall speak with the Kaiser face to face, and\r\n      return. And France lies how! Fleeting Time shears down the great\r\n      and the little; and in two years alters many things.\r\n\r\n      But at all events, here, we say, is a second Ignominious Royal\r\n      Procession, though much altered; to be witnessed also by its\r\n      hundreds of thousands. Patience, ye Paris Patriots; the Royal\r\n      Berline is returning. Not till Saturday: for the Royal Berline\r\n      travels by slow stages; amid such loud-voiced confluent sea of\r\n      National Guards, sixty thousand as they count; amid such tumult\r\n      of all people. Three National-Assembly Commissioners, famed\r\n      Barnave, famed Pétion, generally-respectable Latour-Maubourg,\r\n      have gone to meet it; of whom the two former ride in the Berline\r\n      itself beside Majesty, day after day. Latour, as a mere\r\n      respectability, and man of whom all men speak well, can ride in\r\n      the rear, with Dame Tourzel and the _Soubrettes_.\r\n\r\n      So on Saturday evening, about seven o’clock, Paris by hundreds of\r\n      thousands is again drawn up: not now dancing the tricolor\r\n      joy-dance of hope; nor as yet dancing in fury-dance of hate and\r\n      revenge; but in silence, with vague look of conjecture and\r\n      curiosity mostly scientific. A Sainte-Antoine Placard has given\r\n      notice this morning that “whosoever insults Louis shall be caned,\r\n      whosoever applauds him shall be hanged.” Behold then, at last,\r\n      that wonderful New Berline; encircled by blue National sea with\r\n      fixed bayonets, which flows slowly, floating it on, through the\r\n      silent assembled hundreds of thousands. Three yellow Couriers sit\r\n      atop bound with ropes; Pétion, Barnave, their Majesties, with\r\n      Sister Elizabeth, and the Children of France, are within.\r\n\r\n      Smile of embarrassment, or cloud of dull sourness, is on the\r\n      broad phlegmatic face of his Majesty: who keeps declaring to the\r\n      successive Official-persons, what is evident, ‘_Eh bien, me\r\n      voilà_, Well, here you have me;’ and what is not evident, ‘I do\r\n      assure you I did not mean to pass the frontiers;’ and so forth:\r\n      speeches natural for that poor Royal man; which Decency would\r\n      veil. Silent is her Majesty, with a look of grief and scorn;\r\n      natural for that Royal Woman. Thus lumbers and creeps the\r\n      ignominious Royal Procession, through many streets, amid a\r\n      silent-gazing people: comparable, Mercier thinks,[396] to some\r\n      _Procession de Roi de Bazoche;_ or say, Procession of King\r\n      Crispin, with his Dukes of Sutor-mania and royal blazonry of\r\n      Cordwainery. Except indeed that this is not comic; ah no, it is\r\n      comico-tragic; with bound Couriers, and a Doom hanging over it;\r\n      most fantastic, yet most miserably real. Miserablest _flebile\r\n      ludibrium_ of a Pickleherring Tragedy! It sweeps along there, in\r\n      most ungorgeous pall, through many streets, in the dusty summer\r\n      evening; gets itself at length wriggled out of sight; vanishing\r\n      in the Tuileries Palace—towards its doom, of slow torture, _peine\r\n      forte et dure_.\r\n\r\n      Populace, it is true, seizes the three rope-bound yellow\r\n      Couriers; will at least massacre _them_. But our august Assembly,\r\n      which is sitting at this great moment, sends out Deputation of\r\n      rescue; and the whole is got huddled up. Barnave, “all dusty,” is\r\n      already there, in the National Hall; making brief discreet\r\n      address and report. As indeed, through the whole journey, this\r\n      Barnave has been most discreet, sympathetic; and has gained the\r\n      Queen’s trust, whose noble instinct teaches her always who is to\r\n      be trusted. Very different from heavy Pétion; who, if Campan\r\n      speak truth, ate his luncheon, comfortably filled his wine-glass,\r\n      in the Royal Berline; flung out his chicken-bones past the nose\r\n      of Royalty itself; and, on the King’s saying ‘France cannot be a\r\n      Republic,’ answered ‘No, it is not ripe yet.’ Barnave is\r\n      henceforth a Queen’s adviser, if advice could profit: and her\r\n      Majesty astonishes Dame Campan by signifying almost a regard for\r\n      Barnave: and that, in a day of retribution and Royal triumph,\r\n      Barnave shall _not_ be executed.[397]\r\n\r\n      On Monday night Royalty went; on Saturday evening it returns: so\r\n      much, within one short week, has Royalty accomplished for itself.\r\n      The Pickleherring Tragedy has vanished in the Tuileries Palace,\r\n      towards “pain strong and hard.” Watched, fettered, and humbled,\r\n      as Royalty never was. Watched even in its sleeping-apartments and\r\n      inmost recesses: for it has to sleep with door set ajar, blue\r\n      National Argus watching, his eye fixed on the Queen’s curtains;\r\n      nay, on one occasion, as the Queen cannot sleep, he offers to sit\r\n      by her pillow, and converse a little![398]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.4.IX.\r\n      Sharp Shot.\r\n\r\n      In regard to all which, this most pressing question arises: What\r\n      is to be done with it? ‘Depose it!’ resolutely answer Robespierre\r\n      and the thoroughgoing few. For truly, with a King who runs away,\r\n      and needs to be watched in his very bedroom that he may stay and\r\n      govern you, what other reasonable thing can be done? Had Philippe\r\n      d’Orléans not been a _caput mortuum!_ But of him, known as one\r\n      defunct, no man now dreams. ‘Depose it not; say that it is\r\n      inviolable, that it was spirited away, was _enlevé;_ at any cost\r\n      of sophistry and solecism, reestablish it!’ so answer with loud\r\n      vehemence all manner of Constitutional Royalists; as all your\r\n      Pure Royalists do naturally likewise, with low vehemence, and\r\n      rage compressed by fear, still more passionately answer. Nay\r\n      Barnave and the two Lameths, and what will follow them, do\r\n      likewise answer so. Answer, with their whole might: terror-struck\r\n      at the unknown Abysses on the verge of which, driven thither by\r\n      themselves mainly, all now reels, ready to plunge.\r\n\r\n      By mighty effort and combination this latter course, of\r\n      reestablish it, is the course fixed on; and it shall by the\r\n      strong arm, if not by the clearest logic, be made good. With the\r\n      sacrifice of all their hard-earned popularity, this notable\r\n      Triumvirate, says Toulongeon, “set the Throne up again, which\r\n      they had so toiled to overturn: as one might set up an overturned\r\n      pyramid, on its vertex; to stand so long as it is _held_.”\r\n\r\n      Unhappy France; unhappy in King, Queen, and Constitution; one\r\n      knows not in which unhappiest! Was the meaning of our so glorious\r\n      French Revolution this, and no other, That when Shams and\r\n      Delusions, long soul-killing, had become body-killing, and got\r\n      the length of Bankruptcy and Inanition, a great People rose and,\r\n      with one voice, said, in the Name of the Highest: _Shams shall be\r\n      no more?_ So many sorrows and bloody horrors, endured, and to be\r\n      yet endured through dismal coming centuries, were they not the\r\n      heavy price paid and payable for this same: Total Destruction of\r\n      Shams from among men? And now, O Barnave Triumvirate! is it in\r\n      such _double_-distilled Delusion, and Sham even of a Sham, that\r\n      an Effort of this kind will rest acquiescent? Messieurs of the\r\n      popular Triumvirate: Never! But, after all, what can poor popular\r\n      Triumvirates and fallible august Senators do? They can, when the\r\n      Truth is all too-horrible, stick their heads ostrich-like into\r\n      what sheltering Fallacy is nearest: and wait there, _à\r\n      posteriori._\r\n\r\n      Readers who saw the Clermontais and Three-Bishopricks gallop, in\r\n      the Night of Spurs; Diligences ruffling up all France into one\r\n      terrific terrified Cock of India; and the Town of Nantes in its\r\n      shirt,—may fancy what an affair to settle this was. Robespierre,\r\n      on the extreme Left, with perhaps Pétion and lean old Goupil, for\r\n      the very Triumvirate has defalcated, are shrieking hoarse;\r\n      drowned in Constitutional clamour. But the debate and arguing of\r\n      a whole Nation; the bellowings through all Journals, for and\r\n      against; the reverberant voice of Danton; the Hyperion-shafts of\r\n      Camille; the porcupine-quills of implacable Marat:—conceive all\r\n      this.\r\n\r\n      Constitutionalists in a body, as we often predicted, do now\r\n      recede from the Mother Society, and become _Feuillans;_\r\n      threatening her with inanition, the rank and respectability being\r\n      mostly gone. Petition after Petition, forwarded by Post, or borne\r\n      in Deputation, comes praying for Judgment and _Déchéance_, which\r\n      is our name for Deposition; praying, at lowest, for Reference to\r\n      the Eighty-three Departments of France. Hot Marseillese\r\n      Deputation comes declaring, among other things: ‘Our Phocean\r\n      Ancestors flung a Bar of Iron into the Bay at their first\r\n      landing; this Bar will float again on the Mediterranean brine\r\n      before we consent to be slaves.’ All this for four weeks or more,\r\n      while the matter still hangs doubtful; Emigration streaming with\r\n      double violence over the frontiers;[399] France seething in\r\n      fierce agitation of this question and prize-question: What is to\r\n      be done with the fugitive Hereditary Representative?\r\n\r\n      Finally, on Friday the 15th of July 1791, the National Assembly\r\n      decides; in what negatory manner we know. Whereupon the Theatres\r\n      all close, the _Bourne_-stones and Portable-chairs begin\r\n      spouting, Municipal Placards flaming on the walls, and\r\n      Proclamations published by sound of trumpet, “invite to repose;”\r\n      with small effect. And so, on Sunday the 17th, there shall be a\r\n      thing seen, worthy of remembering. Scroll of a Petition, drawn up\r\n      by Brissots, Dantons, by Cordeliers, Jacobins; for the thing was\r\n      infinitely shaken and manipulated, and many had a hand in it:\r\n      such Scroll lies now visible, on the wooden framework of the\r\n      Fatherland’s Altar, for signature. Unworking Paris, male and\r\n      female, is crowding thither, all day, to sign or to see. Our fair\r\n      Roland herself the eye of History can discern there, “in the\r\n      morning;”[400] not without interest. In few weeks the fair\r\n      Patriot will quit Paris; yet perhaps only to return.\r\n\r\n      But, what with sorrow of baulked Patriotism, what with closed\r\n      theatres, and Proclamations still publishing themselves by sound\r\n      of trumpet, the fervour of men’s minds, this day, is great. Nay,\r\n      over and above, there has fallen out an incident, of the nature\r\n      of Farce-Tragedy and Riddle; enough to stimulate all creatures.\r\n      Early in the day, a Patriot (or some say, it was a Patriotess,\r\n      and indeed Truth is undiscoverable), while standing on the firm\r\n      deal-board of Fatherland’s Altar, feels suddenly, with\r\n      indescribable torpedo-shock of amazement, his bootsole pricked\r\n      through from below; he clutches up suddenly this electrified\r\n      bootsole and foot; discerns next instant—the point of a gimlet or\r\n      brad-awl playing up, through the firm deal-board, and now hastily\r\n      drawing itself back! Mystery, perhaps Treason? The wooden\r\n      frame-work is impetuously broken up; and behold, verily a\r\n      mystery; never explicable fully to the end of the world! Two\r\n      human individuals, of mean aspect, one of them with a wooden leg,\r\n      lie ensconced there, gimlet in hand: they must have come in\r\n      overnight; they have a supply of provisions,—no “barrel of\r\n      gunpowder” that one can _see;_ they affect to be asleep; look\r\n      blank enough, and give the lamest account of themselves. ‘Mere\r\n      curiosity; they were boring up to get an eye-hole; to see,\r\n      perhaps “with lubricity,” whatsoever, from that _new_ point of\r\n      vision, could be seen:’—little that was edifying, one would\r\n      think! But indeed what stupidest thing may not human Dulness,\r\n      Pruriency, Lubricity, Chance and the Devil, choosing Two out of\r\n      Half-a-million idle human heads, tempt them to?[401]\r\n\r\n      Sure enough, the two human individuals with their gimlet are\r\n      there. Ill-starred pair of individuals! For the result of it all\r\n      is that Patriotism, fretting itself, in this state of nervous\r\n      excitability, with hypotheses, suspicions and reports, keeps\r\n      questioning these two distracted human individuals, and again\r\n      questioning them; claps them into the nearest Guardhouse,\r\n      clutches them out again; one hypothetic group snatching them from\r\n      another: till finally, in such extreme state of nervous\r\n      excitability, Patriotism hangs them as spies of Sieur Motier; and\r\n      the life and secret is choked out of them forevermore.\r\n      Forevermore, alas! Or is a day to be looked for when these two\r\n      evidently mean individuals, who are human nevertheless, will\r\n      become Historical Riddles; and, like him of the _Iron Mask_ (also\r\n      a human individual, and evidently nothing more),—have their\r\n      Dissertations? To us this only is certain, that they had a\r\n      gimlet, provisions and a wooden leg; and have died there on the\r\n      Lanterne, as the unluckiest fools might die.\r\n\r\n      And so the signature goes on, in a still more excited manner. And\r\n      Chaumette, for Antiquarians possess the very Paper to this\r\n      hour,[402]—has signed himself “in a flowing saucy hand slightly\r\n      leaned;” and Hébert, detestable _Père Duchesne_, as if “an inked\r\n      spider had dropped on the paper;” Usher Maillard also has signed,\r\n      and many Crosses, which cannot write. And Paris, through its\r\n      thousand avenues, is welling to the Champ-de-Mars and from it, in\r\n      the utmost excitability of humour; central Fatherland’s Altar\r\n      quite heaped with signing Patriots and Patriotesses; the\r\n      Thirty-benches and whole internal Space crowded with onlookers,\r\n      with comers and goers; one regurgitating whirlpool of men and\r\n      women in their Sunday clothes. All which a Constitutional Sieur\r\n      Motier sees; and Bailly, looking into it with his long visage\r\n      made still longer. Auguring no good; perhaps _Déchéance_ and\r\n      Deposition after all! Stop it, ye Constitutional Patriots; fire\r\n      itself is quenchable, yet only quenchable at _first._\r\n\r\n      Stop it, truly: but how stop it? Have not the first Free People\r\n      of the Universe a right to petition?—Happily, if also unhappily,\r\n      here is one proof of riot: these two human individuals, hanged at\r\n      the Lanterne. Proof, O treacherous Sieur Motier? Were they not\r\n      two human individuals sent thither by thee to be hanged; to be a\r\n      pretext for thy bloody _Drapeau Rouge?_ This question shall many\r\n      a Patriot, one day, ask; and answer affirmatively, strong in\r\n      Preternatural Suspicion.\r\n\r\n      Enough, towards half past seven in the evening, the mere natural\r\n      eye can behold this thing: Sieur Motier, with Municipals in\r\n      scarf, with blue National Patrollotism, rank after rank, to the\r\n      clang of drums; wending resolutely to the Champ-de-Mars; Mayor\r\n      Bailly, with elongated visage, bearing, as in sad duty bound, the\r\n      _Drapeau Rouge._ Howl of angry derision rises in treble and bass\r\n      from a hundred thousand throats, at the sight of Martial Law;\r\n      which nevertheless waving its Red sanguinary Flag, advances\r\n      there, from the Gros-Caillou Entrance; advances, drumming and\r\n      waving, towards Altar of Fatherland. Amid still wilder howls,\r\n      with objurgation, obtestation; with flights of pebbles and mud,\r\n      _saxa et fæces;_ with crackle of a pistol-shot;—finally with\r\n      volley-fire of Patrollotism; levelled muskets; roll of volley on\r\n      volley! Precisely after one year and three days, our sublime\r\n      Federation Field is wetted, in this manner, with French blood.\r\n\r\n      Some “Twelve unfortunately shot,” reports Bailly, counting by\r\n      units; but Patriotism counts by tens and even by hundreds. Not to\r\n      be forgotten, nor forgiven! Patriotism flies, shrieking,\r\n      execrating. Camille ceases Journalising, this day; great Danton\r\n      with Camille and Fréron have taken wing, for their life; Marat\r\n      burrows deep in the Earth, and is silent. Once more Patrollotism\r\n      has triumphed: one other time; but it is the last.\r\n\r\n      This was the Royal Flight to Varennes. Thus was the Throne\r\n      overturned thereby; but thus also was it victoriously set up\r\n      again—on its vertex; and will stand while it can be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 2.V.\r\n      PARLIAMENT FIRST\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.I.\r\n      Grande Acceptation.\r\n\r\n      In the last nights of September, when the autumnal equinox is\r\n      past, and grey September fades into brown October, why are the\r\n      Champs Elysées illuminated; why is Paris dancing, and flinging\r\n      fire-works? They are gala-nights, these last of September; Paris\r\n      may well dance, and the Universe: the Edifice of the Constitution\r\n      is completed! Completed; nay _revised_, to see that there was\r\n      nothing insufficient in it; solemnly proferred to his Majesty;\r\n      solemnly accepted by him, to the sound of cannon-salvoes, on the\r\n      fourteenth of the month. And now by such illumination, jubilee,\r\n      dancing and fire-working, do we joyously handsel the new Social\r\n      Edifice, and first raise heat and reek there, in the name of\r\n      Hope.\r\n\r\n      The Revision, especially with a throne standing on its vertex,\r\n      has been a work of difficulty, of delicacy. In the way of\r\n      propping and buttressing, so indispensable now, something could\r\n      be done; and yet, as is feared, not enough. A repentant Barnave\r\n      Triumvirate, our Rabauts, Duports, Thourets, and indeed all\r\n      Constitutional Deputies did strain every nerve: but the Extreme\r\n      Left was so noisy; the People were so suspicious, clamorous to\r\n      have the work ended: and then the loyal Right Side sat feeble\r\n      petulant all the while, and as it were, pouting and petting;\r\n      unable to help, had they even been willing; the two Hundred and\r\n      Ninety had solemnly made scission, before that: and departed,\r\n      shaking the dust off their feet. To such transcendency of fret,\r\n      and desperate hope that worsening of the bad might the sooner end\r\n      it and bring back the good, had our unfortunate loyal Right Side\r\n      now come![403]\r\n\r\n      However, one finds that this and the other little prop has been\r\n      added, where possibility allowed. Civil-list and Privy-purse were\r\n      from of old well cared for. King’s Constitutional Guard, Eighteen\r\n      hundred loyal men from the Eighty-three Departments, under a\r\n      loyal Duke de Brissac; this, with trustworthy Swiss besides, is\r\n      of itself something. The old loyal Bodyguards are indeed\r\n      dissolved, in name as well as in fact; and gone mostly towards\r\n      Coblentz. But now also those Sansculottic violent Gardes\r\n      Françaises, or Centre Grenadiers, shall have their mittimus: they\r\n      do ere long, in the Journals, not without a hoarse pathos,\r\n      publish their Farewell; “wishing all Aristocrats the graves in\r\n      Paris which to us are denied.”[404] They depart, these first\r\n      Soldiers of the Revolution; they hover very dimly in the distance\r\n      for about another year; till they can be remodelled, new-named,\r\n      and sent to fight the Austrians; and then History beholds them no\r\n      more. A most notable Corps of men; which has its place in\r\n      World-History;—though to us, so is History written, they remain\r\n      mere rubrics of men; nameless; a shaggy Grenadier Mass, crossed\r\n      with buff-belts. And yet might we not ask: What Argonauts, what\r\n      Leonidas’ Spartans had done such a work? Think of their destiny:\r\n      since that May morning, some three years ago, when they,\r\n      unparticipating, trundled off d’Espréménil to the Calypso Isles;\r\n      since that July evening, some two years ago, when they,\r\n      participating and _sacre_ing with knit brows, poured a volley\r\n      into Besenval’s Prince de Lambesc! History waves them her mute\r\n      adieu.\r\n\r\n      So that the Sovereign Power, these Sansculottic Watchdogs, more\r\n      like wolves, being leashed and led away from his Tuileries,\r\n      breathes freer. The Sovereign Power is guarded henceforth by a\r\n      loyal Eighteen hundred,—whom Contrivance, under various pretexts,\r\n      may gradually swell to Six thousand; who will hinder no Journey\r\n      to Saint-Cloud. The sad Varennes business has been soldered up;\r\n      cemented, even in the blood of the Champ-de-Mars, these two\r\n      months and more; and indeed ever since, as formerly, Majesty has\r\n      had its privileges, its “choice of residence,” though, for good\r\n      reasons, the royal mind “prefers continuing in Paris.” Poor royal\r\n      mind, poor Paris; that have to go mumming; enveloped in\r\n      speciosities, in falsehood which knows itself false; and to enact\r\n      mutually your sorrowful farce-tragedy, being bound to it; and on\r\n      the whole, to hope always, in spite of hope!\r\n\r\n      Nay, now that his Majesty has accepted the Constitution, to the\r\n      sound of cannon-salvoes, who would not hope? Our good King was\r\n      misguided but he meant well. Lafayette has moved for an Amnesty,\r\n      for universal forgiving and forgetting of Revolutionary faults;\r\n      and now surely the glorious Revolution cleared of its rubbish, is\r\n      complete! Strange enough, and touching in several ways, the old\r\n      cry of _Vive le Roi_ once more rises round King Louis the\r\n      Hereditary Representative. Their Majesties went to the Opera;\r\n      gave money to the Poor: the Queen herself, now when the\r\n      Constitution is accepted, hears voice of cheering. Bygone shall\r\n      be bygone; the New Era _shall_ begin! To and fro, amid those\r\n      lamp-galaxies of the Elysian Fields, the Royal Carriage slowly\r\n      wends and rolls; every where with _vivats_, from a multitude\r\n      striving to be glad. Louis looks out, mainly on the variegated\r\n      lamps and gay human groups, with satisfaction enough for the\r\n      hour. In her Majesty’s face, “under that kind graceful smile a\r\n      deep sadness is legible.”[405] Brilliancies, of valour and of\r\n      wit, stroll here observant: a Dame de Staël, leaning most\r\n      probably on the arm of her Narbonne. She meets Deputies; who have\r\n      built this Constitution; who saunter here with vague\r\n      communings,—not without thoughts whether it will stand. But as\r\n      yet melodious fiddlestrings twang and warble every where, with\r\n      the rhythm of light fantastic feet; long lamp-galaxies fling\r\n      their coloured radiance; and brass-lunged Hawkers elbow and bawl,\r\n      ‘_Grande Acceptation, Constitution Monarchique:_’ it behoves the\r\n      Son of Adam to hope. Have not Lafayette, Barnave, and all\r\n      Constitutionalists set their shoulders handsomely to the inverted\r\n      pyramid of a throne? Feuillans, including almost the whole\r\n      Constitutional Respectability of France, perorate nightly from\r\n      their tribune; correspond through all Post-offices; denouncing\r\n      unquiet Jacobinism; trusting well that _its_ time is nigh done.\r\n      Much is uncertain, questionable: but if the Hereditary\r\n      Representative be wise and lucky, may one not, with a sanguine\r\n      Gaelic temper, hope that he will get in motion better or worse;\r\n      that what is wanting to him will gradually be gained and added?\r\n\r\n      For the rest, as we must repeat, in this building of the\r\n      Constitutional Fabric, especially in this Revision of it, nothing\r\n      that one could think of to give it new strength, especially to\r\n      steady it, to give it permanence, and even eternity, has been\r\n      forgotten. Biennial Parliament, to be called Legislative,\r\n      _Assemblée Legislative;_ with Seven Hundred and Forty-five\r\n      Members, chosen in a judicious manner by the “active citizens”\r\n      alone, and even by electing of electors still more active: this,\r\n      with privileges of Parliament shall meet, self-authorized if need\r\n      be, and self-dissolved; shall grant money-supplies and talk;\r\n      watch over the administration and authorities; discharge for ever\r\n      the functions of a Constitutional Great Council, Collective\r\n      Wisdom, and National Palaver,—as the Heavens will enable. Our\r\n      First biennial Parliament, which indeed has been a-choosing since\r\n      early in August, is now as good as chosen. Nay it has mostly got\r\n      to Paris: it arrived gradually;—not without pathetic greeting to\r\n      its venerable Parent, the now moribund Constituent; and sat there\r\n      in the Galleries, reverently listening; ready to begin, the\r\n      instant the ground were clear.\r\n\r\n      Then as to changes in the Constitution itself? This, impossible\r\n      for any Legislative, or common biennial Parliament, and possible\r\n      solely for some resuscitated Constituent or National\r\n      Convention,—is evidently one of the most ticklish points. The\r\n      august moribund Assembly debated it for four entire days. Some\r\n      thought a change, or at least reviewal and new approval, might be\r\n      admissible in thirty years; some even went lower, down to twenty,\r\n      nay to fifteen. The august Assembly had once decided for thirty\r\n      years; but it revoked that, on better thoughts; and did not fix\r\n      any date of time, but merely some vague outline of a posture of\r\n      circumstances, and on the whole left the matter hanging.[406]\r\n      Doubtless a National Convention can be assembled even _within_\r\n      the thirty years: yet one may hope, not; but that Legislatives,\r\n      biennial Parliaments of the common kind, with their limited\r\n      faculty, and perhaps quiet successive additions thereto, may\r\n      suffice, for generations, or indeed while computed Time runs.\r\n\r\n      Furthermore, be it noted that no member of this Constituent has\r\n      been, or could be, elected to the new Legislative. So\r\n      noble-minded were these Law-makers! cry some: and Solon-like\r\n      would banish themselves. So splenetic! cry more: each grudging\r\n      the other, none daring to be outdone in self-denial by the other.\r\n      So unwise in either case! answer all practical men. But consider\r\n      this other self-denying ordinance, That none of us can be King’s\r\n      Minister, or accept the smallest Court Appointment, for the space\r\n      of four, or at lowest (and on long debate and Revision), for the\r\n      space of two years! So moves the incorruptible seagreen\r\n      Robespierre; with cheap magnanimity he; and none dare be outdone\r\n      by him. It was such a law, not so superfluous _then_, that sent\r\n      Mirabeau to the Gardens of Saint-Cloud, under cloak of darkness,\r\n      to that colloquy of the gods; and thwarted many things. Happily\r\n      and unhappily there is no Mirabeau now to thwart.\r\n\r\n      Welcomer meanwhile, welcome surely to all right hearts, is\r\n      Lafayette’s chivalrous Amnesty. Welcome too is that hard-wrung\r\n      Union of Avignon; which has cost us, first and last, “thirty\r\n      sessions of debate,” and so much else: may it at length prove\r\n      lucky! Rousseau’s statue is decreed: virtuous Jean-Jacques,\r\n      Evangelist of the Contrat Social. Not Drouet of Varennes; nor\r\n      worthy Lataille, master of the old world-famous Tennis Court in\r\n      Versailles, is forgotten; but each has his honourable mention,\r\n      and due reward in money.[407] Whereupon, things being all so\r\n      neatly winded up, and the Deputations, and Messages, and royal\r\n      and other Ceremonials having rustled by; and the King having now\r\n      affectionately perorated about peace and tranquilisation, and\r\n      members having answered ‘_Oui! oui!_’ with effusion, even with\r\n      tears,—President Thouret, he of the Law Reforms, rises, and, with\r\n      a strong voice, utters these memorable last-words: ‘The National\r\n      Constituent Assembly declares that it has finished its mission;\r\n      and that its sittings are all ended.’ Incorruptible Robespierre,\r\n      virtuous Pétion are borne home on the shoulders of the people;\r\n      with vivats heaven-high. The rest glide quietly to their\r\n      respective places of abode. It is the last afternoon of\r\n      September, 1791; on the morrow morning the new Legislative will\r\n      begin.\r\n\r\n      So, amid glitter of illuminated streets and Champs Elysées, and\r\n      crackle of fireworks and glad deray, has the first National\r\n      Assembly vanished; _dissolving_, as they well say, into blank\r\n      Time; and is no more. National Assembly is gone, its work\r\n      remaining; as all Bodies of men go, and as man himself goes: it\r\n      had its beginning, and must likewise have its end. A\r\n      Phantasm-Reality born of Time, as the rest of us are; flitting\r\n      ever backwards now on the tide of Time: to be long remembered of\r\n      men. Very strange Assemblages, Sanhedrims, Amphictyonics, Trades\r\n      Unions, Ecumenic Councils, Parliaments and Congresses, have met\r\n      together on this Planet, and dispersed again; but a stranger\r\n      Assemblage than this august Constituent, or with a stranger\r\n      mission, perhaps never met there. Seen from the distance, this\r\n      also will be a miracle. Twelve Hundred human individuals, with\r\n      the Gospel of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in their pocket, congregating\r\n      in the name of Twenty-five Millions, with full assurance of\r\n      faith, to “make the Constitution:” such sight, the acme and main\r\n      product of the Eighteenth Century, our World can witness once\r\n      only. For Time is rich in wonders, in monstrosities most rich;\r\n      and is observed never to repeat himself, or any of his\r\n      Gospels:—surely least of all, this Gospel according to\r\n      Jean-Jacques. Once it was right and indispensable, since such had\r\n      become the Belief of men; but once also is enough.\r\n\r\n      They have made the Constitution, these Twelve Hundred\r\n      Jean-Jacques Evangelists; not without result. Near twenty-nine\r\n      months they sat, with various fortune; in various\r\n      capacity;—always, we may say, in that capacity of carborne\r\n      Caroccio, and miraculous Standard of the Revolt of Men, as a\r\n      Thing high and lifted up; whereon whosoever looked might hope\r\n      healing. They have seen much: cannons levelled on them; then\r\n      suddenly, by interposition of the Powers, the cannons drawn back;\r\n      and a war-god Broglie vanishing, in thunder _not_ his own, amid\r\n      the dust and downrushing of a Bastille and Old Feudal France.\r\n      They have suffered somewhat: Royal Session, with rain and Oath of\r\n      the Tennis-Court; Nights of Pentecost; Insurrections of Women.\r\n      Also have they not done somewhat? Made the Constitution, and\r\n      managed all things the while; passed, in these twenty-nine\r\n      months, “twenty-five hundred Decrees,” which on the average is\r\n      some three for each day, including Sundays! Brevity, one finds,\r\n      is possible, at times: had not Moreau de St. Mery to give three\r\n      thousand orders before rising from his seat?—There was valour (or\r\n      value) in these men; and a kind of faith,—were it only faith in\r\n      this, That cobwebs are not cloth; that a Constitution could be\r\n      made. Cobwebs and chimeras ought verily to disappear; for _a_\r\n      Reality there is. Let formulas, soul-killing, and now grown\r\n      body-killing, insupportable, begone, in the name of Heaven and\r\n      Earth!—Time, as we say, brought forth these Twelve Hundred;\r\n      Eternity was before them, Eternity behind: they worked, as we all\r\n      do, in the confluence of Two Eternities; what work was given\r\n      them. Say not that it was nothing they did. Consciously they did\r\n      somewhat; unconsciously how much! They had their giants and their\r\n      dwarfs, they accomplished their good and their evil; they are\r\n      gone, and return no more. Shall they not go with our blessing, in\r\n      these circumstances; with our mild farewell?\r\n\r\n      By post, by diligence, on saddle or sole; they are gone: towards\r\n      the four winds! Not a few over the marches, to rank at Coblentz.\r\n      Thither wended Maury, among others; but in the end towards\r\n      Rome,—to be clothed there in red Cardinal plush; in falsehood as\r\n      in a garment; pet son (her _last_-born?) of the Scarlet Woman.\r\n      Talleyrand-Perigord, excommunicated Constitutional Bishop, will\r\n      make his way to London; to be Ambassador, spite of the\r\n      Self-denying Law; brisk young Marquis Chauvelin acting as\r\n      Ambassador’s-Cloak. In London too, one finds Pétion the virtuous;\r\n      harangued and haranguing, pledging the wine-cup with\r\n      Constitutional Reform Clubs, in solemn tavern-dinner.\r\n      Incorruptible Robespierre retires for a little to native Arras:\r\n      seven short weeks of quiet; the last appointed him in this world.\r\n      Public Accuser in the Paris Department, acknowledged highpriest\r\n      of the Jacobins; the glass of incorruptible thin Patriotism, for\r\n      his narrow emphasis is loved of all the narrow,—this man seems to\r\n      be rising, somewhither? He sells his small heritage at Arras;\r\n      accompanied by a Brother and a Sister, he returns, scheming out\r\n      with resolute timidity a small sure destiny for himself and them,\r\n      to his old lodging, at the Cabinet-maker’s, in the Rue St.\r\n      Honoré:—O resolute-tremulous incorruptible seagreen man, towards\r\n      _what_ a destiny!\r\n\r\n      Lafayette, for his part, will lay down the command. He retires\r\n      Cincinnatus-like to his hearth and farm; but soon leaves them\r\n      again. Our National Guard, however, shall henceforth have no one\r\n      Commandant; but all Colonels shall command in succession, month\r\n      about. Other Deputies we have met, or Dame de Staël has met,\r\n      “sauntering in a thoughtful manner;” perhaps uncertain what to\r\n      do. Some, as Barnave, the Lameths, and their Duport, will\r\n      continue here in Paris: watching the new biennial Legislative,\r\n      Parliament the First; teaching it to walk, if so might be; and\r\n      the Court to lead it.\r\n\r\n      Thus these: sauntering in a thoughtful manner; travelling by post\r\n      or diligence,—whither Fate beckons. Giant Mirabeau slumbers in\r\n      the Pantheon of Great Men: and France? and Europe?—The\r\n      brass-lunged Hawkers sing ‘Grand Acceptation, Monarchic\r\n      Constitution’ through these gay crowds: the Morrow, grandson of\r\n      Yesterday, must be what it can, as Today its father is. Our new\r\n      biennial Legislative begins to constitute itself on the first of\r\n      October, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.II.\r\n      The Book of the Law.\r\n\r\n      If the august Constituent Assembly itself, fixing the regards of\r\n      the Universe, could, at the present distance of time and place,\r\n      gain comparatively small attention from us, how much less can\r\n      this poor Legislative! It has its Right Side and its Left; the\r\n      less Patriotic and the more, for Aristocrats exist not here or\r\n      now: it spouts and speaks: listens to Reports, reads Bills and\r\n      Laws; works in its vocation, for a season: but the history of\r\n      France, one finds, is seldom or never there. Unhappy Legislative,\r\n      what can History do with it; if not drop a tear over it, almost\r\n      in silence? First of the two-year Parliaments of France, which,\r\n      if Paper Constitution and oft-repeated National Oath could avail\r\n      aught, were to follow in softly-strong indissoluble sequence\r\n      while Time ran,—it had to vanish dolefully within one year; and\r\n      there came no second like it. Alas! your biennial Parliaments in\r\n      endless indissoluble sequence; they, and all that Constitutional\r\n      Fabric, built with such explosive Federation Oaths, and its\r\n      top-stone brought out with dancing and variegated radiance, went\r\n      to pieces, like frail crockery, in the crash of things; and\r\n      already, in eleven short months, were in that Limbo near the\r\n      Moon, with the ghosts of other Chimeras. There, except for rare\r\n      specific purposes, let them rest, in melancholy peace.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, how unknown is a man to himself; or a public Body\r\n      of men to itself! Æsop’s fly sat on the chariot-wheel,\r\n      exclaiming, What a dust I do raise! Great Governors, clad in\r\n      purple with fasces and insignia, are governed by their valets, by\r\n      the pouting of their women and children; or, in Constitutional\r\n      countries, by the paragraphs of their Able Editors. Say not, I am\r\n      this or that; I am doing this or that! For thou knowest _it_ not,\r\n      thou knowest only the name it as yet goes by. A purple\r\n      Nebuchadnezzar rejoices to feel himself now verily Emperor of\r\n      this great Babylon which he has builded; and _is_ a nondescript\r\n      biped-quadruped, on the eve of a seven-years course of grazing!\r\n      These Seven Hundred and Forty-five elected individuals doubt not\r\n      but they are the First biennial Parliament, come to govern France\r\n      by parliamentary eloquence: and they _are_ what? And they have\r\n      come to do what? Things foolish and not wise!\r\n\r\n      It is much lamented by many that this First Biennial had no\r\n      members of the old Constituent in it, with their experience of\r\n      parties and parliamentary tactics; that such was their foolish\r\n      Self-denying Law. Most surely, old members of the Constituent had\r\n      been welcome to us here. But, on the other hand, what old or what\r\n      new members of any Constituent under the Sun could have\r\n      effectually profited? There are First biennial Parliaments so\r\n      postured as to be, in a sense, _beyond_ wisdom; where wisdom and\r\n      folly differ only in degree, and wreckage and dissolution are the\r\n      appointed issue for both.\r\n\r\n      Old-Constituents, your Barnaves, Lameths and the like, for whom a\r\n      special Gallery has been set apart, where they may sit in honour\r\n      and listen, are in the habit of sneering at these new\r\n      Legislators;[408] but let not us! The poor Seven Hundred and\r\n      Forty-five, sent together by the active citizens of France, are\r\n      what they could be; do what is fated them. That they are of\r\n      Patriot temper we can well understand. Aristocrat Noblesse had\r\n      fled over the marches, or sat brooding silent in their unburnt\r\n      Châteaus; small prospect had they in Primary Electoral\r\n      Assemblies. What with Flights to Varennes, what with Days of\r\n      Poniards, with plot after plot, the People are left to\r\n      themselves; the People must needs choose Defenders of the People,\r\n      such as can be had. Choosing, as _they_ also will ever do, “if\r\n      not the ablest man, yet the man ablest to be chosen!” Fervour of\r\n      character, decided Patriot-Constitutional feeling; these are\r\n      qualities: but free utterance, mastership in tongue-fence; this\r\n      is the quality of qualities. Accordingly one finds, with little\r\n      astonishment, in this First Biennial, that as many as Four\r\n      hundred Members are of the Advocate or Attorney species. Men who\r\n      can speak, if there be aught to speak: nay here are men also who\r\n      can think, and even act. Candour will say of this ill-fated First\r\n      French Parliament that it wanted not its modicum of talent, its\r\n      modicum of honesty; that it, neither in the one respect nor in\r\n      the other, sank below the average of Parliaments, but rose above\r\n      the average. Let average Parliaments, whom the world does _not_\r\n      guillotine, and cast forth to long infamy, be thankful not to\r\n      themselves but to their stars!\r\n\r\n      France, as we say, has once more done what it could: fervid men\r\n      have come together from wide separation; for strange issues.\r\n      Fiery Max Isnard is come, from the utmost South-East; fiery\r\n      Claude Fauchet, Te-Deum Fauchet Bishop of Calvados, from the\r\n      utmost North-West. No Mirabeau now sits here, who had swallowed\r\n      formulas: our only Mirabeau now is Danton, working as yet out of\r\n      doors; whom some call “Mirabeau of the Sansculottes.”\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless we have our gifts,—especially of speech and logic.\r\n      An eloquent Vergniaud we have; most mellifluous yet most\r\n      impetuous of public speakers; from the region named Gironde, of\r\n      the Garonne: a man unfortunately of indolent habits; who will sit\r\n      playing with your children, when he ought to be scheming and\r\n      perorating. Sharp bustling Guadet; considerate grave Censonne;\r\n      kind-sparkling mirthful young Ducos; Valazé doomed to a sad end:\r\n      all these likewise are of that Gironde, or Bourdeaux region: men\r\n      of fervid Constitutional principles; of quick talent,\r\n      irrefragable logic, clear respectability; who will have the Reign\r\n      of Liberty establish itself, but only by respectable methods.\r\n      Round whom others of like temper will gather; known by and by as\r\n      _Girondins_, to the sorrowing wonder of the world. Of which sort\r\n      note Condorcet, Marquis and Philosopher; who has worked at much,\r\n      at Paris Municipal Constitution, Differential Calculus, Newspaper\r\n      _Chronique de Paris_, Biography, Philosophy; and now sits here as\r\n      two-years Senator: a notable Condorcet, with stoical Roman face,\r\n      and fiery heart; “volcano hid under snow;” styled likewise, in\r\n      irreverent language, “_mouton enragé_,” peaceablest of creatures\r\n      bitten rabid! Or note, lastly, Jean-Pierre Brissot; whom Destiny,\r\n      long working noisily with him, has hurled hither, say, to have\r\n      done with him. A biennial Senator he too; nay, for the present,\r\n      the king of such. Restless, scheming, scribbling Brissot; who\r\n      took to himself the style _de Warville_, heralds know not in the\r\n      least why;—unless it were that the father of him did, in an\r\n      unexceptionable manner, perform Cookery and Vintnery in the\r\n      Village of _Ouar_ville? A man of the windmill species, that\r\n      grinds always, turning towards all winds; not in the steadiest\r\n      manner.\r\n\r\n      In all these men there is talent, faculty to work; and they will\r\n      do it: working and shaping, not _without_ effect, though alas not\r\n      in marble, only in quicksand!—But the highest faculty of them all\r\n      remains yet to be mentioned; or indeed has yet to unfold itself\r\n      for mention: Captain Hippolyte Carnot, sent hither from the Pas\r\n      de Calais; with his cold mathematical head, and silent\r\n      stubbornness of will: iron Carnot, far-planning, imperturbable,\r\n      unconquerable; who, in the hour of need, shall not be found\r\n      wanting. His hair is yet black; and it shall grow grey, under\r\n      many kinds of fortune, bright and troublous; and with iron aspect\r\n      this man shall face them all.\r\n\r\n      Nor is _Côté Droit_, and band of King’s friends, wanting:\r\n      Vaublanc, Dumas, Jaucourt the honoured Chevalier; who love\r\n      Liberty, yet with Monarchy over it; and speak fearlessly\r\n      according to that faith;—whom the thick-coming hurricanes will\r\n      sweep away. With them, let a new military Theodore Lameth be\r\n      named;—were it only for his two Brothers’ sake, who look down on\r\n      him, approvingly there, from the Old-Constituents’ Gallery.\r\n      Frothy professing Pastorets, honey-mouthed conciliatory\r\n      Lamourettes, and speechless nameless individuals sit plentiful,\r\n      as Moderates, in the middle. Still less is a _Côté Gauche_\r\n      wanting: extreme Left; sitting on the topmost benches, as if\r\n      aloft on its speculatory Height or _Mountain_, which will become\r\n      a practical fulminatory Height, and make the name of Mountain\r\n      famous-infamous to all times and lands.\r\n\r\n      Honour waits not on this Mountain; nor as yet even loud\r\n      dishonour. Gifts it boasts not, nor graces, of speaking or of\r\n      thinking; solely this one gift of assured faith, of audacity that\r\n      will defy the Earth and the Heavens. Foremost here are the\r\n      Cordelier Trio: hot Merlin from Thionville, hot Bazire, Attorneys\r\n      both; Chabot, disfrocked Capuchin, skilful in agio. Lawyer\r\n      Lacroix, who wore once as subaltern the single epaulette, has\r\n      loud lungs and a hungry heart. There too is Couthon, little\r\n      dreaming _what_ he is;—whom a sad chance has paralysed in the\r\n      lower extremities. For, it seems, he sat once a whole night, not\r\n      warm in his true love’s bower (who indeed was by law another’s),\r\n      but sunken to the middle in a cold peat-bog, being hunted out;\r\n      quaking for his life, in the cold quaking morass;[409] and goes\r\n      now on crutches to the end. Cambon likewise, in whom slumbers\r\n      undeveloped such a finance-talent for printing of Assignats;\r\n      Father of Paper-money; who, in the hour of menace, shall utter\r\n      this stern sentence, “War to the Manorhouse, peace to the Hut,\r\n      _Guerre aux Châteaux, paix aux Chaumières!_”[410] Lecointre, the\r\n      intrepid Draper of Versailles, is welcome here; known since the\r\n      Opera-Repast and Insurrection of Women. Thuriot too; Elector\r\n      Thuriot, who stood in the embrasures of the Bastille, and saw\r\n      Saint-Antoine rising in mass; who has many other things to see.\r\n      Last and grimmest of all note old Ruhl, with his brown dusky face\r\n      and long white hair; of Alsatian Lutheran breed; a man whom age\r\n      and book-learning have not taught; who, haranguing the old men of\r\n      Rheims, shall hold up the Sacred _Ampulla_ (Heaven-sent,\r\n      wherefrom Clovis and all Kings have been anointed) as a mere\r\n      worthless oil-bottle, and dash it to sherds on the pavement\r\n      there; who, alas, shall dash much to sherds, and finally his own\r\n      wild head, by pistol-shot, and so end it.\r\n\r\n      Such lava welters redhot in the bowels of this Mountain; unknown\r\n      to the world and to itself! A mere commonplace Mountain hitherto;\r\n      distinguished from the Plain chiefly by its superior\r\n      _barrenness_, its baldness of look: at the utmost it may, to the\r\n      most observant, perceptibly _smoke_. For as yet all lies so\r\n      solid, peaceable; and doubts not, as was said, that it will\r\n      endure while Time runs. Do not all love Liberty and the\r\n      Constitution? All heartily;—and yet with degrees. Some, as\r\n      Chevalier Jaucourt and his Right Side, may love Liberty less than\r\n      Royalty, were the trial made; others, as Brissot and his Left\r\n      Side, may love it more than Royalty. Nay again of these latter\r\n      some may love Liberty more than Law itself; others not more.\r\n      Parties _will_ unfold themselves; no mortal as yet knows how.\r\n      Forces work within these men and without: dissidence grows\r\n      opposition; ever widening; waxing into incompatibility and\r\n      internecine feud: till the strong is abolished by a stronger;\r\n      himself in his turn by a strongest! Who can help it? Jaucourt and\r\n      his Monarchists, Feuillans, or Moderates; Brissot and his\r\n      Brissotins, Jacobins, or Girondins; these, with the Cordelier\r\n      Trio, and all men, must work what is appointed them, and in the\r\n      way appointed them.\r\n\r\n      And to think what fate these poor Seven Hundred and Forty-five\r\n      are assembled, most unwittingly, to meet! Let no heart be so hard\r\n      as not to pity them. Their soul’s wish was to live and work as\r\n      the First of the French Parliaments: and make the Constitution\r\n      march. Did they not, at their very instalment, go through the\r\n      most affecting Constitutional ceremony, almost with tears? The\r\n      Twelve Eldest are sent solemnly to fetch the Constitution itself,\r\n      the printed book of the Law. Archivist Camus, an Old-Constituent\r\n      appointed Archivist, he and the Ancient Twelve, amid blare of\r\n      military pomp and clangour, enter, bearing the divine Book: and\r\n      President and all Legislative Senators, laying their hand on the\r\n      same, successively take the Oath, with cheers and heart-effusion,\r\n      universal three-times-three.[411] In this manner they begin their\r\n      Session. Unhappy mortals! For, that same day, his Majesty having\r\n      received their Deputation of welcome, as seemed, rather drily,\r\n      the Deputation cannot but feel slighted, cannot but lament such\r\n      slight: and thereupon our cheering swearing First Parliament sees\r\n      itself, on the morrow, obliged to explode into fierce retaliatory\r\n      sputter, of anti-royal Enactment as to how they, for their part,\r\n      will receive Majesty; and how Majesty shall not be called Sire\r\n      any more, except they please: and then, on the following day, to\r\n      recall this Enactment of theirs, as too hasty, and a mere sputter\r\n      though not unprovoked.\r\n\r\n      An effervescent well-intentioned set of Senators; too\r\n      combustible, where continual sparks are flying! Their History is\r\n      a series of sputters and quarrels; true desire to do their\r\n      function, fatal impossibility to do it. Denunciations,\r\n      reprimandings of King’s Ministers, of traitors supposed and real;\r\n      hot rage and fulmination against fulminating Emigrants; terror of\r\n      Austrian Kaiser, of “Austrian Committee” in the Tuileries itself:\r\n      rage and haunting terror, haste and dim desperate\r\n      bewilderment!—Haste, we say; and yet the Constitution had\r\n      provided against haste. No Bill can be passed till it have been\r\n      printed, till it have been thrice read, with intervals of eight\r\n      days;—“unless the Assembly shall beforehand decree that there is\r\n      urgency.” Which, accordingly, the Assembly, scrupulous of the\r\n      Constitution, never omits to do: Considering this, and also\r\n      considering that, and then that other, the Assembly decrees\r\n      always “_qu’il y a urgence;_” and thereupon “the Assembly, having\r\n      decreed that there is urgence,” is free to decree—what\r\n      indispensable distracted thing seems best to it. Two thousand and\r\n      odd decrees, as men reckon, within Eleven months![412] The haste\r\n      of the Constituent seemed great; but this is treble-quick. For\r\n      the time itself is rushing treble-quick; and they have to keep\r\n      pace with that. Unhappy Seven Hundred and Forty-five:\r\n      true-patriotic, but so combustible; being fired, they must needs\r\n      fling fire: Senate of touchwood and rockets, in a world of\r\n      smoke-storm, with sparks wind-driven continually flying!\r\n\r\n      Or think, on the other hand, looking forward some months, of that\r\n      scene they call _Baiser de Lamourette!_ The dangers of the\r\n      country are now grown imminent, immeasurable; National Assembly,\r\n      hope of France, is divided against itself. In such extreme\r\n      circumstances, honey-mouthed Abbé Lamourette, new Bishop of\r\n      Lyons, rises, whose name, _l’amourette_, signifies the\r\n      _sweetheart_, or Delilah doxy,—he rises, and, with pathetic\r\n      honied eloquence, calls on all august Senators to forget mutual\r\n      griefs and grudges, to swear a new oath, and unite as brothers.\r\n      Whereupon they all, with vivats, embrace and swear; Left Side\r\n      confounding itself with Right; barren Mountain rushing down to\r\n      fruitful Plain, Pastoret into the arms of Condorcet, injured to\r\n      the breast of injurer, with tears; and all swearing that\r\n      whosoever wishes either Feuillant Two-Chamber Monarchy or\r\n      Extreme-Jacobin Republic, or any thing but the Constitution and\r\n      that only, shall be anathema maranatha.[413] Touching to behold!\r\n      For, literally on the morrow morning, they must again quarrel,\r\n      driven by Fate; and their sublime reconcilement is called\r\n      derisively _Baiser de L’amourette_, or Delilah Kiss.\r\n\r\n      Like fated Eteocles-Polynices Brothers, embracing, though in\r\n      vain; weeping that they must not love, that they must hate only,\r\n      and die by each other’s hands! Or say, like doomed Familiar\r\n      Spirits; ordered, by Art Magic under penalties, to do a harder\r\n      than twist ropes of sand: “to make the Constitution march.” If\r\n      the Constitution would but march! Alas, the Constitution will not\r\n      stir. It falls on its face; they tremblingly lift it on end\r\n      again: march, thou gold Constitution! The Constitution will not\r\n      march.—‘He shall march, by—!’ said kind Uncle Toby, and even\r\n      swore. The Corporal answered mournfully: ‘He will never march in\r\n      this world.’\r\n\r\n      A constitution, as we often say, will march when it images, if\r\n      not the old Habits and Beliefs of the Constituted; then\r\n      accurately their Rights, or better indeed, their Mights;—for\r\n      these two, well-understood, are they not one and the same? The\r\n      old Habits of France are gone: her new Rights and Mights are not\r\n      yet ascertained, except in Paper-theorem; nor can be, in any\r\n      sort, till she have _tried_. Till she have measured herself, in\r\n      fell death-grip, and were it in utmost preternatural spasm of\r\n      madness, with Principalities and Powers, with the upper and the\r\n      under, internal and external; with the Earth and Tophet and the\r\n      very Heaven! Then will she know.—Three things bode ill for the\r\n      marching of this French Constitution: the French People; the\r\n      French King; thirdly the French Noblesse and an assembled\r\n      European World.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.III.\r\n      Avignon.\r\n\r\n      But quitting generalities, what strange Fact is this, in the far\r\n      South-West, towards which the eyes of all men do now, in the end\r\n      of October, bend themselves? A tragical combustion, long smoking\r\n      and smouldering unluminous, has now burst into flame there.\r\n\r\n      Hot is that Southern Provençal blood: alas, collisions, as was\r\n      once said, must occur in a career of Freedom; different\r\n      directions will produce such; nay different _velocities_ in the\r\n      same direction will! To much that went on there History, busied\r\n      elsewhere, would not specially give heed: to troubles of Uzez,\r\n      troubles of Nismes, Protestant and Catholic, Patriot and\r\n      Aristocrat; to troubles of Marseilles, Montpelier, Arles; to\r\n      Aristocrat Camp of Jalès, that wondrous real-imaginary Entity,\r\n      now fading pale-dim, then always again glowing forth deep-hued\r\n      (in the Imagination mainly);—ominous magical, “an Aristocrat\r\n      _picture_ of war done naturally!” All this was a tragical deadly\r\n      combustion, with plot and riot, tumult by night and by day; but a\r\n      _dark_ combustion, not luminous, not noticed; which now, however,\r\n      one cannot help noticing.\r\n\r\n      Above all places, the unluminous combustion in Avignon and the\r\n      Comtat Venaissin was fierce. Papal Avignon, with its Castle\r\n      rising sheer over the Rhone-stream; beautifullest Town, with its\r\n      purple vines and gold-orange groves: why must foolish old rhyming\r\n      Réné, the last Sovereign of Provence, bequeath it to the Pope and\r\n      Gold Tiara, not rather to Louis Eleventh with the Leaden Virgin\r\n      in his hatband? For good and for evil! Popes, Anti-popes, with\r\n      their pomp, have dwelt in that Castle of Avignon rising sheer\r\n      over the Rhone-stream: there Laura de Sade went to hear mass; her\r\n      Petrarch twanging and singing by the Fountain of Vaucluse hard\r\n      by, surely in a most melancholy manner. This was in the old days.\r\n\r\n      And now in these new days, such issues do come from a squirt of\r\n      the pen by some foolish rhyming Réné, after centuries, this is\r\n      what we have: Jourdan _Coupe-tête_, leading to siege and warfare\r\n      an Army, from three to fifteen thousand strong, called the\r\n      Brigands of Avignon; which title they themselves accept, with the\r\n      addition of an epithet, “The _brave_ Brigands of Avignon!” It is\r\n      even so. Jourdan the Headsman fled hither from that Chatelet\r\n      Inquest, from that Insurrection of Women; and began dealing in\r\n      madder; but the scene was rife in other than dye-stuffs; so\r\n      Jourdan shut his madder shop, and has risen, for he was the man\r\n      to do it. The tile-beard of Jourdan is shaven off; his fat visage\r\n      has got coppered and studded with black carbuncles; the Silenus\r\n      trunk is swollen with drink and high living: he wears blue\r\n      National uniform with epaulettes, “an enormous sabre, two\r\n      horse-pistols crossed in his belt, and other two smaller,\r\n      sticking from his pockets;” styles himself General, and is the\r\n      tyrant of men.[414] Consider this one fact, O Reader; and what\r\n      sort of facts must have preceded it, must accompany it! Such\r\n      things come of old Réné; and of the question which has risen,\r\n      Whether Avignon cannot now cease wholly to be Papal and become\r\n      French and free?\r\n\r\n      For some twenty-five months the confusion has lasted. Say three\r\n      months of arguing; then seven of raging; then finally some\r\n      fifteen months now of fighting, and even of hanging. For already\r\n      in February 1790, the Papal Aristocrats had set up four gibbets,\r\n      for a sign; but the People rose in June, in retributive frenzy;\r\n      and, forcing the public Hangman to act, hanged four Aristocrats,\r\n      on each Papal gibbet a Papal Haman. Then were Avignon\r\n      Emigrations, Papal Aristocrats emigrating over the Rhone River;\r\n      demission of Papal Consul, flight, victory: re-entrance of Papal\r\n      Legate, truce, and new onslaught; and the various turns of war.\r\n      Petitions there were to National Assembly; Congresses of\r\n      Townships; three-score and odd Townships voting for French\r\n      Reunion, and the blessings of Liberty; while some twelve of the\r\n      smaller, manipulated by Aristocrats, gave vote the other way:\r\n      with shrieks and discord! Township against Township, Town against\r\n      Town: Carpentras, long jealous of Avignon, is now turned out in\r\n      open war with it;—and Jourdan _Coupe-tête_, your first General\r\n      being killed in mutiny, closes his dye-shop; and does there\r\n      visibly, with siege-artillery, above all with bluster and tumult,\r\n      with the “brave Brigands of Avignon,” beleaguer the rival Town,\r\n      for two months, in the face of the world!\r\n\r\n      Feats were done, doubt it not, far-famed in Parish History; but\r\n      to Universal History unknown. Gibbets we see rise, on the one\r\n      side and on the other; and wretched carcasses swinging there, a\r\n      dozen in the row; wretched Mayor of Vaison buried before\r\n      dead.[415] The fruitful seedfield, lie unreaped, the vineyards\r\n      trampled down; there is red cruelty, madness of universal choler\r\n      and gall. Havoc and anarchy everywhere; a combustion most fierce,\r\n      but _un_lucent, not to be noticed here!—Finally, as we saw, on\r\n      the 14th of September last, the National Constituent Assembly,\r\n      having sent Commissioners and heard them;[416] having heard\r\n      Petitions, held Debates, month after month ever since August\r\n      1789; and on the whole “spent thirty sittings” on this matter,\r\n      did solemnly decree that Avignon and the Comtat were incorporated\r\n      with France, and His Holiness the Pope should have what indemnity\r\n      was reasonable.\r\n\r\n      And so hereby all is amnestied and finished? Alas, when madness\r\n      of choler has gone through the blood of men, and gibbets have\r\n      swung on this side and on that, what will a parchment Decree and\r\n      Lafayette Amnesty do? Oblivious Lethe flows not _above_ ground!\r\n      Papal Aristocrats and Patriot Brigands are still an eye-sorrow to\r\n      each other; suspected, suspicious, in what they do and forbear.\r\n      The august Constituent Assembly is gone but a fortnight, when, on\r\n      Sunday the Sixteenth morning of October 1791, the unquenched\r\n      combustion suddenly becomes luminous! For Anti-constitutional\r\n      Placards are up, and the Statue of the Virgin is said to have\r\n      shed tears, and grown red.[417] Wherefore, on that morning,\r\n      Patriot l’Escuyer, one of our “six leading Patriots,” having\r\n      taken counsel with his brethren and General Jourdan, determines\r\n      on going to Church, in company with a friend or two: not to hear\r\n      mass, which he values little; but to meet all the Papalists there\r\n      in a body, nay to meet that same weeping Virgin, for it is the\r\n      Cordeliers Church; and give them a word of admonition.\r\n      Adventurous errand; which has the fatallest issue! What\r\n      L’Escuyer’s word of admonition might be no History records; but\r\n      the answer to it was a shrieking howl from the Aristocrat Papal\r\n      worshippers, many of them women. A thousand-voiced shriek and\r\n      menace; which as L’Escuyer did not fly, became a thousand-handed\r\n      hustle and jostle; a thousand-footed kick, with tumblings and\r\n      tramplings, with the pricking of semstresses stilettos, scissors,\r\n      and female pointed instruments. Horrible to behold; the ancient\r\n      Dead, and Petrarchan Laura, sleeping round it there;[418] high\r\n      Altar and burning tapers looking down on it; the Virgin quite\r\n      tearless, and of the natural stone-colour!—L’Escuyer’s friend or\r\n      two rush off, like Job’s Messengers, for Jourdan and the National\r\n      Force. But heavy Jourdan will seize the Town-Gates first; does\r\n      not run treble-fast, as he might: on arriving at the Cordeliers\r\n      Church, the Church is silent, vacant; L’Escuyer, all alone, lies\r\n      there, swimming in his blood, at the foot of the high Altar;\r\n      pricked with scissors; trodden, massacred;—gives one dumb sob,\r\n      and gasps out his miserable life for evermore.\r\n\r\n      Sight to stir the heart of any man; much more of many men,\r\n      self-styled Brigands of Avignon! The corpse of L’Escuyer,\r\n      stretched on a bier, the ghastly head girt with laurel, is borne\r\n      through the streets; with many-voiced unmelodious _Nenia;_\r\n      funeral-wail still deeper than it is loud! The copper-face of\r\n      Jourdan, of bereft Patriotism, has grown black. Patriot\r\n      Municipality despatches official Narrative and tidings to Paris;\r\n      orders numerous or innumerable arrestments for inquest and\r\n      perquisition. Aristocrats male and female are haled to the\r\n      Castle; lie crowded in subterranean dungeons there, bemoaned by\r\n      the hoarse rushing of the Rhone; cut out from help.\r\n\r\n      So lie they; waiting inquest and perquisition. Alas! with a\r\n      Jourdan Headsman for Generalissimo, with his copper-face grown\r\n      black, and armed Brigand Patriots chanting their _Nenia_, the\r\n      inquest is likely to be brief. On the next day and the next, let\r\n      Municipality consent or not, a Brigand Court-Martial establishes\r\n      itself in the subterranean stories of the Castle of Avignon;\r\n      Brigand Executioners, with naked sabre, waiting at the door, for\r\n      a Brigand verdict. Short judgment, no appeal! There is Brigand\r\n      wrath and vengeance; not unrefreshed by brandy. Close by is the\r\n      Dungeon of the _Glacière_, or Ice-Tower: there may be deeds\r\n      done—? For which language has no name!—Darkness and the shadow of\r\n      horrid cruelty envelopes these Castle Dungeons, that _Glacière_\r\n      Tower: clear only that many have entered, that few have returned.\r\n      Jourdan and the Brigands, supreme now over Municipals, over all\r\n      Authorities Patriot or Papal, reign in Avignon, waited on by\r\n      Terror and Silence.\r\n\r\n      The result of all which is that, on the 15th of November 1791, we\r\n      behold Friend Dampmartin, and subalterns beneath him, and General\r\n      Choisi above him, with Infantry and Cavalry, and proper\r\n      cannon-carriages rattling in front, with spread banners, to the\r\n      sound of fife and drum, wend, in a deliberate formidable manner,\r\n      towards that sheer Castle Rock, towards those broad Gates of\r\n      Avignon; three new National-Assembly Commissioners following at\r\n      safe distance in the rear.[419] Avignon, summoned in the name of\r\n      Assembly and Law, flings its Gates wide open; Choisi with the\r\n      rest, Dampmartin and the _Bons Enfans_, “Good Boys of\r\n      _Baufremont_,” so they name these brave Constitutional Dragoons,\r\n      known to them of old,—do enter, amid shouts and scattered\r\n      flowers. To the joy of all honest persons; to the terror only of\r\n      Jourdan Headsman and the Brigands. Nay next we behold carbuncled\r\n      swollen Jourdan himself shew copper-face, with sabre and four\r\n      pistols; affecting to talk high: engaging, meanwhile, to\r\n      surrender the Castle that instant. So the Choisi Grenadiers enter\r\n      with him there. They start and stop, passing that _Glacière_,\r\n      snuffing its horrible breath; with wild yell, with cries of ‘Cut\r\n      the Butcher down!’—and Jourdan has to whisk himself through\r\n      secret passages, and instantaneously vanish.\r\n\r\n      Be the mystery of iniquity laid bare then! A Hundred and Thirty\r\n      Corpses, of men, nay of women and even children (for the\r\n      trembling mother, hastily seized, could not leave her infant),\r\n      lie heaped in that _Glacière;_ putrid, under putridities: the\r\n      horror of the world. For three days there is mournful lifting\r\n      out, and recognition; amid the cries and movements of a\r\n      passionate Southern people, now kneeling in prayer, now storming\r\n      in wild pity and rage: lastly there is solemn sepulture, with\r\n      muffled drums, religious requiem, and all the people’s wail and\r\n      tears. Their Massacred rest now in holy ground; buried in one\r\n      grave.\r\n\r\n      And Jourdan _Coupe-tête?_ Him also we behold again, after a day\r\n      or two: in flight, through the most romantic Petrarchan\r\n      hill-country; vehemently spurring his nag; young Ligonnet, a\r\n      brisk youth of Avignon, with Choisi Dragoons, close in his rear!\r\n      With such swollen mass of a rider no nag can run to advantage.\r\n      The tired nag, spur-driven, does take the River Sorgue; but\r\n      sticks in the middle of it; firm on that _chiaro fondo di Sorga;_\r\n      and will proceed no further for spurring! Young Ligonnet dashes\r\n      up; the Copper-face menaces and bellows, draws pistol, perhaps\r\n      even snaps it; is nevertheless seized by the collar; is tied\r\n      firm, ancles under horse’s belly, and ridden back to Avignon,\r\n      hardly to be saved from massacre on the streets there.[420]\r\n\r\n      Such is the combustion of Avignon and the South-West, when it\r\n      becomes luminous! Long loud debate is in the august Legislative,\r\n      in the Mother-Society as to what now shall be done with it.\r\n      Amnesty, cry eloquent Vergniaud and all Patriots: let there be\r\n      mutual pardon and repentance, restoration, pacification, and if\r\n      so might any how be, an end! Which vote ultimately prevails. So\r\n      the South-West smoulders and welters again in an “Amnesty,” or\r\n      Non-remembrance, which alas cannot but remember, no Lethe flowing\r\n      above ground! Jourdan himself remains unchanged; gets loose again\r\n      as one not yet gallows-ripe; nay, as we transciently discern from\r\n      the distance, is “carried in triumph through the cities of the\r\n      South.”[421] What things men carry!\r\n\r\n      With which transient glimpse, of a Copper-faced Portent faring in\r\n      this manner through the cities of the South, we must quit these\r\n      regions;—and let them smoulder. They want not their Aristocrats;\r\n      proud old Nobles, not yet emigrated. Arles has its “_Chiffonne_,”\r\n      so, in symbolical cant, they name that Aristocrat\r\n      Secret-Association; Arles has its pavements piled up, by and by,\r\n      into Aristocrat barricades. Against which Rebecqui, the hot-clear\r\n      Patriot, must lead Marseilles with cannon. The Bar of Iron has\r\n      not yet risen to the top in the Bay of Marseilles; neither have\r\n      these hot Sons of the Phoceans submitted to be slaves. By clear\r\n      management and hot instance, Rebecqui dissipates that\r\n      _Chiffonne_, without bloodshed; restores the pavement of Arles.\r\n      He sails in Coast-barks, this Rebecqui, scrutinising suspicious\r\n      Martello-towers, with the keen eye of Patriotism; marches\r\n      overland with despatch, singly, or in force; to City after City;\r\n      dim scouring far and wide;[422]—argues, and if it must be,\r\n      fights. For there is much to do; Jalès itself is looking\r\n      suspicious. So that Legislator Fauchet, after debate on it, has\r\n      to propose Commissioners and a Camp on the Plain of Beaucaire:\r\n      with or without result.\r\n\r\n      Of all which, and much else, let us note only this small\r\n      consequence, that young Barbaroux, Advocate, Town-Clerk of\r\n      Marseilles, being charged to have these things remedied, arrived\r\n      at Paris in the month of February 1792. The beautiful and brave:\r\n      young Spartan, ripe in energy, not ripe in wisdom; over whose\r\n      black doom there shall flit nevertheless a certain ruddy fervour,\r\n      streaks of bright Southern tint, not wholly swallowed of Death!\r\n      Note also that the Rolands of Lyons are again in Paris; for the\r\n      second and final time. King’s Inspectorship is abrogated at\r\n      Lyons, as elsewhere: Roland has his retiring-pension to claim, if\r\n      attainable; has Patriot friends to commune with; at lowest, has a\r\n      book to publish. That young Barbaroux and the Rolands came\r\n      together; that elderly Spartan Roland liked, or even loved the\r\n      young Spartan, and was loved by him, one can fancy: and Madame—?\r\n      Breathe not, thou poison-breath, Evil-speech! That soul is\r\n      taintless, clear, as the mirror-sea. And yet if they too did look\r\n      into each other’s eyes, and each, in silence, in tragical\r\n      renunciance, did find that the other was all too lovely? _Honi\r\n      soit!_ She calls him “beautiful as Antinous:” he “will speak\r\n      elsewhere of that astonishing woman.”—A Madame d’Udon (or some\r\n      such name, for Dumont does not recollect quite clearly) gives\r\n      copious Breakfast to the Brissotin Deputies and us Friends of\r\n      Freedom, at her house in the Place Vendôme; with temporary\r\n      celebrity, with graces and wreathed smiles; not without cost.\r\n      There, amid wide babble and jingle, our plan of Legislative\r\n      Debate is settled for the day, and much counselling held. Strict\r\n      Roland is seen there, but does not go often.[423]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.IV.\r\n      No Sugar.\r\n\r\n      Such are our inward troubles; seen in the Cities of the South;\r\n      extant, seen or unseen, in all cities and districts, North as\r\n      well as South. For in all are Aristocrats, more or less\r\n      malignant; watched by Patriotism; which again, being of various\r\n      shades, from light Fayettist-Feuillant down to deep-sombre\r\n      Jacobin, has to watch _itself!_\r\n\r\n      Directories of Departments, what we call County Magistracies,\r\n      being chosen by Citizens of a too “active” class, are found to\r\n      pull one way; Municipalities, Town Magistracies, to pull the\r\n      other way. In all places too are Dissident Priests; whom the\r\n      Legislative will have to deal with: contumacious individuals,\r\n      working on that angriest of passions; plotting, enlisting for\r\n      Coblentz; or suspected of plotting: fuel of a universal\r\n      unconstitutional heat. What to do with them? They may be\r\n      conscientious as well as contumacious: gently they should be\r\n      dealt with, and yet it must be speedily. In unilluminated La\r\n      Vendée the simple are like to be seduced by them; many a simple\r\n      peasant, a Cathelineau the wool-dealer wayfaring meditative with\r\n      his wool-packs, in these hamlets, dubiously shakes his head! Two\r\n      Assembly Commissioners went thither last Autumn; considerate\r\n      Gensonné, not yet called to be a Senator; Gallois, an editorial\r\n      man. These Two, consulting with General Dumouriez, spake and\r\n      worked, softly, with judgment; they have hushed down the\r\n      irritation, and produced a soft Report,—for the time.\r\n\r\n      The General himself doubts not in the least but he can keep peace\r\n      there; being an able man. He passes these frosty months among the\r\n      pleasant people of Niort, occupies “tolerably handsome apartments\r\n      in the Castle of Niort,” and tempers the minds of men.[424] Why\r\n      is there but one Dumouriez? Elsewhere you find South or North,\r\n      nothing but untempered obscure jarring; which breaks forth ever\r\n      and anon into open clangour of riot. Southern Perpignan has its\r\n      tocsin, by torch light; with rushing and onslaught: Northern Caen\r\n      not less, by daylight; with Aristocrats ranged in arms at Places\r\n      of Worship; Departmental compromise proving impossible; breaking\r\n      into musketry and a Plot discovered![425] Add Hunger too: for\r\n      Bread, always dear, is getting dearer: not so much as Sugar can\r\n      be had; for good reasons. Poor Simoneau, Mayor of Etampes, in\r\n      this Northern region, hanging out his Red Flag in some riot of\r\n      grains, is trampled to death by a hungry exasperated People. What\r\n      a trade this of Mayor, in these times! Mayor of Saint-Denis hung\r\n      at the Lanterne, by Suspicion and Dyspepsia, as we saw long\r\n      since; Mayor of Vaison, as we saw lately, buried before dead; and\r\n      now this poor Simoneau, the Tanner, of Etampes,—whom legal\r\n      Constitutionalism will not forget.\r\n\r\n      With factions, suspicions, want of bread and sugar, it is verily\r\n      what they call _déchiré_, torn asunder this poor country: France\r\n      and all that is French. For, over seas too come bad news. In\r\n      black Saint-Domingo, before that variegated Glitter in the Champs\r\n      Elysées was lit for an Accepted Constitution, there had risen,\r\n      and was burning contemporary with it, quite another variegated\r\n      Glitter and nocturnal Fulgor, had we known it: of molasses and\r\n      ardent-spirits; of sugar-boileries, plantations, furniture,\r\n      cattle and men: skyhigh; the Plain of Cap Français one huge whirl\r\n      of smoke and flame!\r\n\r\n      What a change here, in these two years; since that first “Box of\r\n      Tricolor Cockades” got through the Custom-house, and atrabiliar\r\n      Creoles too rejoiced that there was a levelling of Bastilles!\r\n      Levelling is comfortable, as we often say: levelling, yet only\r\n      down to oneself. Your pale-white Creoles, have their\r\n      grievances:—and your yellow Quarteroons? And your dark-yellow\r\n      Mulattoes? And your Slaves soot-black? Quarteroon Ogé, Friend of\r\n      our Parisian Brissotin _Friends of the Blacks_, felt, for his\r\n      share too, that Insurrection was the most sacred of duties. So\r\n      the tricolor Cockades had fluttered and swashed only some three\r\n      months on the Creole hat, when Ogé’s signal-conflagrations went\r\n      aloft; with the voice of rage and terror. Repressed, doomed to\r\n      die, he took black powder or seedgrains in the hollow of his\r\n      hand, this Ogé; sprinkled a film of white ones on the top, and\r\n      said to his Judges, ‘Behold they are white;’—then _shook_ his\r\n      hand, and said ‘Where are the Whites, _Où sont les Blancs?_’\r\n\r\n      So now, in the Autumn of 1791, looking from the sky-windows of\r\n      Cap Français, thick clouds of smoke girdle our horizon, smoke in\r\n      the day, in the night fire; preceded by fugitive shrieking white\r\n      women, by Terror and Rumour. Black demonised squadrons are\r\n      massacring and harrying, with nameless cruelty. They fight and\r\n      fire “from behind thickets and coverts,” for the Black man loves\r\n      the Bush; they rush to the attack, thousands strong, with\r\n      brandished cutlasses and fusils, with caperings, shoutings and\r\n      vociferation,—which, if the White Volunteer Company stands firm,\r\n      dwindle into staggerings, into quick gabblement, into panic\r\n      flight at the first volley, perhaps before it.[426] Poor Ogé\r\n      could be broken on the wheel; this fire-whirlwind too can be\r\n      abated, driven up into the Mountains: but Saint-Domingo is\r\n      _shaken_, as Ogé’s seedgrains were; shaking, writhing in long\r\n      horrid death-throes, it is Black without remedy; and remains, as\r\n      African Haiti, a monition to the world.\r\n\r\n      O my Parisian Friends, is not _this_, as well as Regraters and\r\n      Feuillant Plotters, one cause of the astonishing dearth of Sugar!\r\n      The Grocer, palpitant, with drooping lip, sees his Sugar _taxé;_\r\n      weighed out by Female Patriotism, in instant retail, at the\r\n      inadequate rate of twenty-five sous, or thirteen pence a pound.\r\n      ‘Abstain from it?’ yes, ye Patriot Sections, all ye Jacobins,\r\n      abstain! Louvet and Collot-d’Herbois so advise; resolute to make\r\n      the sacrifice: though ‘how shall literary men do without coffee?’\r\n      Abstain, with an oath; that is the surest![427]\r\n\r\n      Also, for like reason, must not Brest and the Shipping Interest\r\n      languish? Poor Brest languishes, sorrowing, not without spleen;\r\n      denounces an Aristocrat Bertrand-Moleville traitorous Aristocrat\r\n      Marine-Minister. Do not her Ships and King’s Ships lie rotting\r\n      piecemeal in harbour; Naval Officers mostly fled, and on furlough\r\n      too, with pay? Little stirring there; if it be not the Brest\r\n      Gallies, whip-driven, with their Galley-Slaves,—alas, with some\r\n      Forty of our hapless Swiss Soldiers of Château-Vieux, among\r\n      others! These Forty Swiss, too mindful of Nanci, do now, in their\r\n      red wool caps, tug sorrowfully at the oar; looking into the\r\n      Atlantic brine, which reflects only their own sorrowful shaggy\r\n      faces; and seem forgotten of Hope.\r\n\r\n      But, on the whole, may we not say, in fugitive language, that the\r\n      French Constitution which shall march is very _rheumatic_, full\r\n      of shooting internal pains, in joint and muscle; and will not\r\n      march without difficulty?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.V.\r\n      Kings and Emigrants.\r\n\r\n      Extremely rheumatic Constitutions have been known to march, and\r\n      keep on their feet, though in a staggering sprawling manner, for\r\n      long periods, in virtue of one thing only: that the _Head_ were\r\n      healthy. But this Head of the French Constitution! What King\r\n      Louis is and cannot help being, Readers already know. A King who\r\n      cannot take the Constitution, nor reject the Constitution: nor do\r\n      anything at all, but miserably ask, What shall I do? A King\r\n      environed with endless confusions; in whose own mind is no germ\r\n      of order. Haughty implacable remnants of Noblesse struggling with\r\n      humiliated repentant Barnave-Lameths: struggling in that obscure\r\n      element of fetchers and carriers, of Half-pay braggarts from the\r\n      Café Valois, of Chambermaids, whisperers, and subaltern officious\r\n      persons; fierce Patriotism looking on all the while, more and\r\n      more suspicious, from without: what, in such struggle, can they\r\n      do? At best, _cancel_ one another, and produce _zero_. Poor King!\r\n      Barnave and your Senatorial Jaucourts speak earnestly into this\r\n      ear; Bertrand-Moleville, and Messengers from Coblentz, speak\r\n      earnestly into that: the poor Royal head turns to the one side\r\n      and to the other side; can turn itself fixedly to no side. Let\r\n      Decency drop a veil over it: sorrier misery was seldom enacted in\r\n      the world. This one small fact, does it not throw the saddest\r\n      light on much? The Queen is lamenting to Madam Campan: ‘What am I\r\n      to do? When they, these Barnaves, get us advised to any step\r\n      which the Noblesse do not like, then I am pouted at; nobody comes\r\n      to my card table; the King’s Couchée is solitary.’[428] In such a\r\n      case of dubiety, what _is_ one to do? Go inevitably to the\r\n      ground!\r\n\r\n      The King has accepted this Constitution, knowing beforehand that\r\n      it will not serve: he studies it, and executes it in the hope\r\n      mainly that it will be found inexecutable. King’s Ships lie\r\n      rotting in harbour, their officers gone; the Armies disorganised;\r\n      robbers scour the highways, which wear down unrepaired; all\r\n      Public Service lies slack and waste: the Executive makes no\r\n      effort, or an effort only to throw the blame on the Constitution.\r\n      Shamming death, “_faisant le mort!_” What Constitution, use it in\r\n      this manner, can march? “Grow to disgust the Nation” it will\r\n      truly,[429]—unless _you_ first grow to disgust the Nation! It is\r\n      Bertrand de Moleville’s plan, and his Majesty’s; the best they\r\n      can form.\r\n\r\n      Or if, after all, this best-plan proved too slow; proved a\r\n      failure? Provident of that too, the Queen, shrouded in deepest\r\n      mystery, “writes all day, in cipher, day after day, to Coblentz;”\r\n      Engineer Goguelat, he of the _Night of Spurs_, whom the Lafayette\r\n      Amnesty has delivered from Prison, rides and runs. Now and then,\r\n      on fit occasion, a Royal familiar visit can be paid to that Salle\r\n      de Manége, an affecting encouraging Royal Speech (sincere, doubt\r\n      it not, for the moment) can be delivered there, and the Senators\r\n      all cheer and almost weep;—at the same time Mallet du Pan has\r\n      visibly ceased editing, and invisibly bears abroad a King’s\r\n      Autograph, soliciting help from the Foreign Potentates.[430]\r\n      Unhappy Louis, _do_ this thing or else that other,—if thou\r\n      couldst!\r\n\r\n      The thing which the King’s Government did do was to stagger\r\n      distractedly from contradiction to contradiction; and wedding\r\n      Fire to Water, envelope itself in hissing, and ashy steam! Danton\r\n      and needy corruptible Patriots are sopped with presents of cash:\r\n      they accept the sop: they rise refreshed by it, and travel their\r\n      own way.[431] Nay, the King’s Government did likewise hire\r\n      Hand-clappers, or _claqueurs_, persons to applaud. Subterranean\r\n      Rivarol has Fifteen Hundred men in King’s pay, at the rate of\r\n      some ten thousand pounds sterling per month; what he calls “a\r\n      staff of genius:” Paragraph-writers, Placard-Journalists; “two\r\n      hundred and eighty Applauders, at three shillings a day:” one of\r\n      the strangest Staffs ever commanded by man. The muster-rolls and\r\n      account-books of which still exist.[432] Bertrand-Moleville\r\n      himself, in a way he thinks very dexterous, contrives to pack the\r\n      Galleries of the Legislative; gets Sansculottes hired to go\r\n      thither, and applaud at a signal given, they fancying it was\r\n      Pétion that bid them: a device which was not detected for almost\r\n      a week. Dexterous enough; as if a man finding the Day fast\r\n      decline should determine on altering the Clockhands: _that_ is a\r\n      thing possible for him.\r\n\r\n      Here too let us note an unexpected apparition of Philippe\r\n      d’Orléans at Court: his last at the Levee of any King. D’Orléans,\r\n      sometime in the winter months seemingly, has been appointed to\r\n      that old first-coveted rank of Admiral,—though only over ships\r\n      rotting in port. The wished-for comes too late! However, he waits\r\n      on Bertrand-Moleville to give thanks: nay to state that he would\r\n      willingly thank his Majesty in person; that, in spite of all the\r\n      horrible things men have said and sung, he is far from being his\r\n      Majesty’s enemy; at bottom, how far! Bertrand delivers the\r\n      message, brings about the royal Interview, which does pass to the\r\n      satisfaction of his Majesty; d’Orléans seeming clearly repentant,\r\n      determined to turn over a new leaf. And yet, next Sunday, what do\r\n      we see? “Next Sunday,” says Bertrand, “he came to the King’s\r\n      Levee; but the Courtiers ignorant of what had passed, the crowd\r\n      of Royalists who were accustomed to resort thither on that day\r\n      specially to pay their court, gave him the most humiliating\r\n      reception. They came pressing round him; managing, as if by\r\n      mistake, to tread on his toes, to elbow him towards the door, and\r\n      not let him enter again. He went downstairs to her Majesty’s\r\n      Apartments, where cover was laid; so soon as he shewed face,\r\n      sounds rose on all sides, ‘_Messieurs, take care of the dishes_,’\r\n      as if he had carried poison in his pockets. The insults which his\r\n      presence every where excited forced him to retire without having\r\n      seen the Royal Family: the crowd followed him to the Queen’s\r\n      Staircase; in descending, he received a spitting (_crachat_) on\r\n      the head, and some others, on his clothes. Rage and spite were\r\n      seen visibly painted on his face:”[433] as indeed how could they\r\n      miss to be? He imputes it all to the King and Queen, who know\r\n      nothing of it, who are even much grieved at it; and so descends,\r\n      to his Chaos again. Bertrand was there at the Château that day\r\n      himself, and an eye-witness to these things.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, Non-jurant Priests, and the repression of them,\r\n      will distract the King’s conscience; Emigrant Princes and\r\n      Noblesse will force him to double-dealing: there must be _veto_\r\n      on _veto;_ amid the ever-waxing indignation of men. For\r\n      Patriotism, as we said, looks on from without, more and more\r\n      suspicious. Waxing tempest, blast after blast, of Patriot\r\n      indignation, from without; dim inorganic whirl of Intrigues,\r\n      Fatuities, within! Inorganic, fatuous; from which the eye turns\r\n      away. De Staël intrigues for her so gallant Narbonne, to get him\r\n      made War-Minister; and ceases not, having got him made. The King\r\n      shall fly to Rouen; shall there, with the gallant Narbonne,\r\n      properly “modify the Constitution.” This is the same brisk\r\n      Narbonne, who, last year, cut out from their entanglement, by\r\n      force of dragoons, those poor fugitive Royal Aunts: men say he is\r\n      at bottom their Brother, or even _more_, so scandalous is\r\n      scandal. He drives now, with his de Staël, rapidly to the Armies,\r\n      to the Frontier Towns; produces rose-coloured Reports, not too\r\n      credible; perorates, gesticulates; wavers poising himself on the\r\n      top, for a moment, seen of men; then tumbles, dismissed, washed\r\n      away by the Time-flood.\r\n\r\n      Also the fair Princess de Lamballe intrigues, bosom friend of her\r\n      Majesty: to the angering of Patriotism. Beautiful Unfortunate,\r\n      why did she ever return from England? Her small silver-voice,\r\n      what can it profit in that piping of the black World-tornado?\r\n      Which will whirl _her_, poor fragile Bird of Paradise, against\r\n      grim rocks. Lamballe and de Staël intrigue visibly, apart or\r\n      together: but who shall reckon how many others, and in what\r\n      infinite ways, invisibly! Is there not what one may call an\r\n      “Austrian Committee,” sitting invisible in the Tuileries; centre\r\n      of an invisible Anti-National Spiderweb, which, for we sleep\r\n      among mysteries, stretches its threads to the ends of the Earth?\r\n      Journalist Carra has now the clearest certainty of it: to\r\n      Brissotin Patriotism, and France generally, it is growing more\r\n      and more probable.\r\n\r\n      O Reader, hast thou no pity for this Constitution? Rheumatic\r\n      shooting pains in its members; pressure of hydrocephale and\r\n      hysteric vapours on its Brain: a Constitution divided against\r\n      itself; which will never march, hardly even stagger? Why were not\r\n      Drouet and Procureur Sausse in their beds, that unblessed\r\n      Varennes Night! Why did they not, in the name of Heaven, let the\r\n      Korff Berline go whither it listed! Nameless incoherency,\r\n      incompatibility, perhaps prodigies at which the world still\r\n      shudders, had been spared.\r\n\r\n      But now comes the third thing that bodes ill for the marching of\r\n      this French Constitution: besides the French People, and the\r\n      French King, there is thirdly—the assembled European world? it\r\n      has become necessary now to look at that also. Fair France is so\r\n      luminous: and round and round it, is troublous Cimmerian Night.\r\n      Calonnes, Bréteuils hover dim, far-flown; overnetting Europe with\r\n      intrigues. From Turin to Vienna; to Berlin, and utmost Petersburg\r\n      in the frozen North! Great Burke has raised his great voice long\r\n      ago; eloquently demonstrating that the end of an Epoch is come,\r\n      to all appearance the end of Civilised Time. Him many answer:\r\n      Camille Desmoulins, Clootz Speaker of Mankind, Paine the\r\n      rebellious Needleman, and honourable Gallic Vindicators in that\r\n      country and in this: but the great Burke remains unanswerable;\r\n      “The Age of Chivalry _is_ gone,” and could not but go, having now\r\n      produced the still more indomitable Age of Hunger. Altars enough,\r\n      of the Dubois-Rohan sort, changing to the Gobel-and-Talleyrand\r\n      sort, are faring by rapid transmutation to, shall we say, the\r\n      right Proprietor of them? French Game and French Game-Preservers\r\n      did alight on the Cliffs of Dover, with cries of distress. Who\r\n      will say that the end of much is not come? A set of mortals has\r\n      risen, who believe that Truth is not a printed Speculation, but a\r\n      practical Fact; that Freedom and Brotherhood are possible in this\r\n      Earth, supposed always to be Belial’s, which “the Supreme Quack”\r\n      was to inherit! Who will say that Church, State, Throne, Altar\r\n      are not in danger; that the sacred Strong-box itself, last\r\n      Palladium of effete Humanity, may not be blasphemously blown\r\n      upon, and its padlocks undone?\r\n\r\n      The poor Constituent Assembly might act with what delicacy and\r\n      diplomacy it would; declare that it abjured meddling with its\r\n      neighbours, foreign conquest, and so forth; but from the first\r\n      this thing was to be predicted: that old Europe and new France\r\n      could not subsist _together_. A Glorious Revolution, oversetting\r\n      State-Prisons and Feudalism; publishing, with outburst of\r\n      Federative Cannon, in face of all the Earth, that Appearance is\r\n      not Reality, how shall it subsist amid Governments which, if\r\n      Appearance is _not_ Reality, are—one knows not what? In death\r\n      feud, and internecine wrestle and battle, it shall subsist with\r\n      them; not otherwise.\r\n\r\n      Rights of Man, printed on Cotton Handkerchiefs, in various\r\n      dialects of human speech, pass over to the Frankfort Fair.[434]\r\n      What say we, Frankfort Fair? They have crossed Euphrates and the\r\n      fabulous Hydaspes; wafted themselves beyond the Ural, Altai,\r\n      Himmalayah: struck off from wood stereotypes, in angular\r\n      Picture-writing, they are jabbered and jingled of in China and\r\n      Japan. Where will it stop? Kien-Lung smells mischief; not the\r\n      remotest Dalai-Lama shall now knead his dough-pills in\r\n      peace.—Hateful to us; as is the Night! Bestir yourselves, ye\r\n      Defenders of Order! They do bestir themselves: all Kings and\r\n      Kinglets, with their spiritual temporal array, are astir; their\r\n      brows clouded with menace. Diplomatic emissaries fly swift;\r\n      Conventions, privy Conclaves assemble; and wise wigs wag, taking\r\n      what counsel they can.\r\n\r\n      Also, as we said, the Pamphleteer draws pen, on this side and\r\n      that: zealous fists beat the Pulpit-drum. Not without issue! Did\r\n      not iron Birmingham, shouting “Church and King,” itself knew not\r\n      why, burst out, last July, into rage, drunkenness, and fire; and\r\n      your Priestleys, and the like, dining there on that Bastille day,\r\n      get the maddest singeing: scandalous to consider! In which same\r\n      days, as we can remark, high Potentates, Austrian and Prussian,\r\n      with Emigrants, were faring towards Pilnitz in Saxony; there, on\r\n      the 27th of August, they, keeping to themselves what further\r\n      “secret Treaty” there might or might not be, did publish their\r\n      hopes and their threatenings, their Declaration that it was “the\r\n      common cause of Kings.”\r\n\r\n      Where a will to quarrel is, there is a way. Our readers remember\r\n      that Pentecost-Night, Fourth of August 1789, when Feudalism fell\r\n      in a few hours? The National Assembly, in abolishing Feudalism,\r\n      promised that “compensation” should be given; and did endeavour\r\n      to give it. Nevertheless the Austrian Kaiser answers that his\r\n      German Princes, for their part, cannot be unfeudalised; that they\r\n      have Possessions in French Alsace, and Feudal Rights secured to\r\n      them, for which no conceivable compensation will suffice. So this\r\n      of the Possessioned Princes, “_Princes Possessionés_” is bandied\r\n      from Court to Court; covers acres of diplomatic paper at this\r\n      day: a weariness to the world. Kaunitz argues from Vienna;\r\n      Delessart responds from Paris, though perhaps not sharply enough.\r\n      The Kaiser and his Possessioned Princes will too evidently come\r\n      and _take_ compensation—so much as they can get. Nay might one\r\n      not _partition_ France, as we have done Poland, and are doing;\r\n      and so pacify it with a vengeance?\r\n\r\n      From South to North! For actually it is “the common cause of\r\n      Kings.” Swedish Gustav, sworn Knight of the Queen of France, will\r\n      lead Coalised Armies;—had not Ankarstrom treasonously shot him;\r\n      for, indeed, there were griefs nearer home.[435] Austria and\r\n      Prussia speak at Pilnitz; all men intensely listening: Imperial\r\n      Rescripts have gone out from Turin; there will be secret\r\n      Convention at Vienna. Catherine of Russia beckons approvingly;\r\n      will help, were she ready. Spanish Bourbon stirs amid his\r\n      pillows; from him too, even from him, shall there come help. Lean\r\n      Pitt, “the Minister of Preparatives,” looks out from his\r\n      watch-tower in Saint-James’s, in a suspicious manner. Councillors\r\n      plotting, Calonnes dim-hovering;—alas, Serjeants rub-a-dubbing\r\n      openly through all manner of German market-towns, collecting\r\n      ragged valour![436] Look where you will, immeasurable\r\n      Obscurantism is girdling this fair France; which, again, will not\r\n      be girdled by it. Europe is in travail; pang after pang; what a\r\n      shriek was that of Pilnitz! The birth will be: WAR.\r\n\r\n      Nay the worst feature of the business is this last, still to be\r\n      named; the Emigrants at Coblentz, so many thousands ranking\r\n      there, in bitter hate and menace: King’s Brothers, all Princes of\r\n      the Blood except wicked d’Orléans; your duelling de Castries,\r\n      your eloquent Cazalès; bull-headed Malseignes, a wargod Broglie;\r\n      Distaff Seigneurs, insulted Officers, all that have ridden across\r\n      the Rhine-stream;—d’Artois welcoming Abbé Maury with a kiss, and\r\n      clasping him publicly to his own royal heart! Emigration, flowing\r\n      over the Frontiers, now in drops, now in streams, in various\r\n      humours of fear, of petulance, rage and hope, ever since those\r\n      first Bastille days when d’Artois went, “to shame the citizens of\r\n      Paris,”—has swollen to the size of a Phenomenon of the world.\r\n      Coblentz is become a small extra-national Versailles; a\r\n      Versailles _in partibus:_ briguing, intriguing, favouritism,\r\n      strumpetocracy itself, they say, goes on there; all the old\r\n      activities, on a small scale, quickened by hungry Revenge.\r\n\r\n      Enthusiasm, of loyalty, of hatred and hope, has risen to a high\r\n      pitch; as, in any Coblentz tavern, you may hear, in speech, and\r\n      in singing. Maury assists in the interior Council; much is\r\n      decided on; for one thing, they keep lists of the dates of your\r\n      emigrating; a month sooner, or a month later determines your\r\n      greater or your less right to the coming Division of the Spoil.\r\n      Cazalès himself, because he had occasionally spoken with a\r\n      Constitutional tone, was looked on coldly at first: so pure are\r\n      our principles.[437] And arms are a-hammering at Liège; “three\r\n      thousand horses” ambling hitherward from the Fairs of Germany:\r\n      Cavalry enrolling; likewise Foot-soldiers, “in blue coat, red\r\n      waistcoat, and nankeen trousers!”[438] They have their secret\r\n      domestic correspondences, as their open foreign: with disaffected\r\n      Crypto-Aristocrats, with contumacious Priests, with Austrian\r\n      Committee in the Tuileries. Deserters are spirited over by\r\n      assiduous crimps; Royal-Allemand is gone almost wholly. Their\r\n      route of march, towards France and the Division of the Spoil, is\r\n      marked out, were the Kaiser once ready. ‘It is said, they mean to\r\n      poison the sources; but,’ adds Patriotism making Report of it,\r\n      ‘they will not poison the source of Liberty,’ whereat “_on\r\n      applaudit_,” we cannot but applaud. Also they have manufactories\r\n      of False Assignats; and men that circulate in the interior\r\n      distributing and disbursing the same; one of these we denounce\r\n      now to Legislative Patriotism: “A man Lebrun by name; about\r\n      thirty years of age, with blonde hair and in quantity; has,” only\r\n      for the time being surely, “a black-eye, _œil poché;_ goes in a\r\n      _wiski_ with a black horse,”[439]—always keeping his Gig!\r\n\r\n      Unhappy Emigrants, it was their lot, and the lot of France! They\r\n      are ignorant of much that they should know: of themselves, of\r\n      what is around them. A Political Party that knows not _when it is\r\n      beaten_, may become one of the fatallist of things, to itself,\r\n      and to all. Nothing will convince these men that they cannot\r\n      scatter the French Revolution at the first blast of their\r\n      war-trumpet; that the French Revolution is other than a\r\n      blustering Effervescence, of brawlers and spouters, which, at the\r\n      flash of chivalrous broadswords, at the rustle of gallows-ropes,\r\n      will burrow itself, in dens the deeper the welcomer. But, alas,\r\n      what man does know and measure himself, and the things that are\r\n      round him;—else where were the need of physical fighting at all?\r\n      Never, till they are cleft asunder, can these heads believe that\r\n      a Sansculottic arm has any vigour in it: cleft asunder, it will\r\n      be too late to believe.\r\n\r\n      One may say, without spleen against his poor erring brothers of\r\n      any side, that above all other mischiefs, this of the Emigrant\r\n      Nobles acted fatally on France. Could they have known, could they\r\n      have understood! In the beginning of 1789, a splendour and a\r\n      terror still surrounded them: the Conflagration of their\r\n      Châteaus, kindled by months of obstinacy, went out after the\r\n      Fourth of August; and might have continued out, had they at all\r\n      known what to defend, what to relinquish as indefensible. They\r\n      were still a graduated Hierarchy of Authorities, or the\r\n      accredited Similitude of such: they sat there, uniting King with\r\n      Commonalty; transmitting and translating _gradually_, from degree\r\n      to degree, the command of the one into the obedience of the\r\n      other; rendering command and obedience still possible. Had they\r\n      understood their place, and what to do in it, this French\r\n      Revolution, which went forth explosively in years and in months,\r\n      might have spread itself over generations; and not a\r\n      torture-death but a quiet euthanasia have been provided for many\r\n      things.\r\n\r\n      But they were proud and high, these men; they were not wise to\r\n      consider. They spurned all from them; in disdainful hate, they\r\n      drew the sword and flung away the scabbard. France has not only\r\n      no Hierarchy of Authorities, to translate command into obedience;\r\n      its Hierarchy of Authorities has fled to the enemies of France;\r\n      calls loudly on the enemies of France to interfere armed, who\r\n      want but a pretext to do that. Jealous Kings and Kaisers might\r\n      have looked on long, meditating interference, yet afraid and\r\n      ashamed to interfere: but now do not the King’s Brothers, and all\r\n      French Nobles, Dignitaries and Authorities that are free to\r\n      speak, which the King himself is not,—passionately invite us, in\r\n      the name of Right and of Might? Ranked at Coblentz, from Fifteen\r\n      to Twenty thousand stand now brandishing their weapons, with the\r\n      cry: On, on! Yes, Messieurs, you shall on;—and divide the spoil\r\n      according to your dates of emigrating.\r\n\r\n      Of all which things a poor Legislative Assembly, and Patriot\r\n      France, is informed: by denunciant friend, by triumphant foe.\r\n      Sulleau’s Pamphlets, of the Rivarol Staff of Genius, circulate;\r\n      heralding supreme hope. Durosoy’s Placards tapestry the walls;\r\n      _Chant du Coq_ crows day, pecked at by Tallien’s _Ami des\r\n      Citoyens_. King’s-Friend, Royou, _Ami du Roi_, can name, in exact\r\n      arithmetical ciphers, the contingents of the various Invading\r\n      Potentates; in all, Four hundred and nineteen thousand Foreign\r\n      fighting men, with Fifteen thousand Emigrants. Not to reckon\r\n      these your daily and hourly desertions, which an Editor must\r\n      daily record, of whole Companies, and even Regiments, crying\r\n      _Vive le Roi, Vive la Reine_, and marching over with banners\r\n      spread:[440]—lies all, and wind; yet to Patriotism not wind; nor,\r\n      alas, one day, to Royou! Patriotism, therefore, may brawl and\r\n      babble yet a little while: but its hours are numbered: Europe is\r\n      coming with Four hundred and nineteen thousand and the Chivalry\r\n      of France; the gallows, one may hope, will get its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.VI.\r\n      Brigands and Jalès.\r\n\r\n      We shall have War, then; and on what terms! With an Executive\r\n      “pretending,” really with less and less deceptiveness now, “to be\r\n      dead;” casting even a wishful eye towards the enemy: on such\r\n      terms we shall have War.\r\n\r\n      Public Functionary in vigorous action there is none; if it be not\r\n      Rivarol with his Staff of Genius and Two hundred and eighty\r\n      Applauders. The Public Service lies waste: the very tax-gatherer\r\n      has forgotten his cunning: in this and the other Provincial Board\r\n      of Management (_Directoire de Départment_) it is found advisable\r\n      to _retain_ what Taxes you can gather, to pay your own inevitable\r\n      expenditures. Our Revenue is Assignats; emission on emission of\r\n      Paper-money. And the Army; our Three grand Armies, of Rochambeau,\r\n      of Lückner, of Lafayette? Lean, disconsolate hover these Three\r\n      grand Armies, watching the Frontiers there; three Flights of\r\n      long-necked Cranes in moulting time;—wretched, disobedient,\r\n      disorganised; who never saw fire; the old Generals and Officers\r\n      gone across the Rhine. War-minister Narbonne, he of the\r\n      rose-coloured Reports, solicits recruitments, equipments, money,\r\n      always money; threatens, since he can get none,—to “take his\r\n      sword,” which belongs to himself, and go serve his country with\r\n      that.[441]\r\n\r\n      The question of questions is: What shall be done? Shall we, with\r\n      a desperate defiance which Fortune sometimes favours, draw the\r\n      sword at once, in the face of this in-rushing world of Emigration\r\n      and Obscurantism; or wait, and temporise and diplomatise, till,\r\n      if possible, our resources mature themselves a little? And yet\r\n      again are our resources growing towards maturity; or growing the\r\n      _other_ way? Dubious: the ablest Patriots are divided; Brissot\r\n      and his Brissotins, or Girondins, in the Legislative, cry aloud\r\n      for the former defiant plan; Robespierre, in the Jacobins, pleads\r\n      as loud for the latter dilatory one: with responses, even with\r\n      mutual reprimands; distracting the Mother of Patriotism. Consider\r\n      also what agitated Breakfasts there may be at Madame d’Udon’s in\r\n      the Place Vendôme! The alarm of all men is great. Help, ye\r\n      Patriots; and O at least agree; for the hour presses. Frost was\r\n      not yet gone, when in that “tolerably handsome apartment of the\r\n      Castle of Niort,” there arrived a Letter: General Dumouriez must\r\n      to Paris. It is War-minister Narbonne that writes; the General\r\n      shall give counsel about many things.[442] In the month of\r\n      February 1792, Brissotin friends welcome their Dumouriez\r\n      _Polymetis_,—comparable really to an antique Ulysses in modern\r\n      costume; quick, elastic, shifty, insuppressible, a\r\n      “many-counselled man.”\r\n\r\n      Let the Reader fancy this fair France with a whole Cimmerian\r\n      Europe girdling her, rolling in on her; black, to burst in red\r\n      thunder of War; fair France herself hand-shackled and\r\n      foot-shackled in the weltering complexities of this Social\r\n      Clothing, or Constitution, which they have made for her; a France\r\n      that, in such Constitution, cannot march! And Hunger too; and\r\n      plotting Aristocrats, and excommunicating Dissident Priests: “The\r\n      man Lebrun by name” urging his black _wiski_, visible to the eye:\r\n      and, still more terrible in his invisibility, Engineer Goguelat,\r\n      with Queen’s cipher, riding and running!\r\n\r\n      The excommunicatory Priests give new trouble in the Maine and\r\n      Loire; La Vendée, nor Cathelineau the wool-dealer, has not ceased\r\n      grumbling and rumbling. Nay behold Jalès itself once more: how\r\n      often does that real-imaginary Camp of the Fiend require to be\r\n      extinguished! For near two years now, it has waned faint and\r\n      again waxed bright, in the bewildered soul of Patriotism:\r\n      actually, if Patriotism knew it, one of the most surprising\r\n      products of Nature working with Art. Royalist Seigneurs, under\r\n      this or the other pretext, assemble the simple people of these\r\n      Cevennes Mountains; men not unused to revolt, and with heart for\r\n      fighting, could their poor heads be got persuaded. The Royalist\r\n      Seigneur harangues; harping mainly on the religious string: ‘True\r\n      Priests maltreated, false Priests intruded, Protestants (once\r\n      dragooned) now triumphing, things sacred given to the dogs;’ and\r\n      so produces, from the pious Mountaineer throat, rough growlings.\r\n      ‘Shall we not testify, then, ye brave hearts of the Cevennes;\r\n      march to the rescue? Holy Religion; duty to God and King?’ ‘_Si\r\n      fait, si fait_, Just so, just so,’ answer the brave hearts\r\n      always: ‘_Mais il y a de bien bonnes choses dans la Révolution_,\r\n      But there are many good things in the Revolution too!’—And so the\r\n      matter, cajole as we may, will only turn on its axis, not stir\r\n      from the spot, and remains theatrical merely.[443]\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless deepen your cajolery, harp quick and quicker, ye\r\n      Royalist Seigneurs; with a dead-lift effort you may bring it to\r\n      that. In the month of June next, this _Camp of Jalès_ will step\r\n      forth as a theatricality suddenly become real; Two thousand\r\n      strong, and with the boast that it is Seventy thousand: most\r\n      strange to see; with flags flying, bayonets fixed; with\r\n      Proclamation, and d’Artois Commission of civil war! Let some\r\n      Rebecqui, or other the like hot-clear Patriot; let some\r\n      “Lieutenant-Colonel Aubry,” if Rebecqui is busy elsewhere, raise\r\n      instantaneous National Guards, and disperse and dissolve it; and\r\n      blow the Old Castle asunder,[444] that so, if possible, we hear\r\n      of it no more!\r\n\r\n      In the Months of February and March, it is recorded, the terror,\r\n      especially of rural France, had risen even to the transcendental\r\n      pitch: not far from madness. In Town and Hamlet is rumour; of\r\n      war, massacre: that Austrians, Aristocrats, above all, that _The\r\n      Brigands_ are close by. Men quit their houses and huts; rush\r\n      fugitive, shrieking, with wife and child, they know not whither.\r\n      Such a terror, the eye-witnesses say, never fell on a Nation; nor\r\n      shall again fall, even in Reigns of Terror expressly so-called.\r\n      The Countries of the Loire, all the Central and South-East\r\n      regions, start up distracted, “simultaneously as by an electric\r\n      shock;”—for indeed grain too gets scarcer and scarcer. “The\r\n      people barricade the entrances of Towns, pile stones in the upper\r\n      stories, the women prepare boiling water; from moment to moment,\r\n      expecting the attack. In the Country, the alarm-bell rings\r\n      incessant: troops of peasants, gathered by it, scour the\r\n      highways, seeking an imaginary enemy. They are armed mostly with\r\n      scythes stuck in wood; and, arriving in wild troops at the\r\n      barricaded Towns, are themselves sometimes taken for\r\n      Brigands.”[445]\r\n\r\n      So rushes old France: old France is rushing _down_. What the end\r\n      will be is known to no mortal; that the end is near all mortals\r\n      may know.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.VII.\r\n      Constitution will not march.\r\n\r\n      To all which our poor Legislative, tied up by an unmarching\r\n      Constitution, can oppose nothing, by way of remedy, but mere\r\n      bursts of parliamentary eloquence! They go on, debating,\r\n      denouncing, objurgating: loud weltering Chaos, which devours\r\n      _itself._\r\n\r\n      But their two thousand and odd Decrees? Reader, these happily\r\n      concern not thee, nor me. Mere Occasional Decrees, foolish and\r\n      not foolish; sufficient for _that_ day was its own evil! Of the\r\n      whole two thousand there are not, now half a score, and these\r\n      mostly blighted in the bud by royal _Veto_, that will profit or\r\n      disprofit us. On the 17th of January, the Legislative, for one\r\n      thing, got its High Court, its _Haute Cour_, set up at Orléans.\r\n      The theory had been given by the Constituent, in May last, but\r\n      this is the reality: a Court for the trial of Political Offences;\r\n      a Court which cannot want work. To this it was decreed that there\r\n      needed no royal Acceptance, therefore that there could be no\r\n      _Veto_. Also Priests can now be married; ever since last October.\r\n      A patriotic adventurous Priest had made bold to marry himself\r\n      then; and not thinking this enough, came to the bar with his new\r\n      spouse; that the whole world might hold honey-moon with him, and\r\n      a Law be obtained.\r\n\r\n      Less joyful are the Laws against Refractory Priests; and yet no\r\n      less needful! Decrees on Priests and Decrees on Emigrants: these\r\n      are the two brief Series of Decrees, worked out with endless\r\n      debate, and then cancelled by _Veto_, which mainly concern us\r\n      here. For an august National Assembly must needs conquer these\r\n      Refractories, Clerical or Laic, and thumbscrew them into\r\n      obedience; yet, behold, always as you turn your legislative\r\n      thumbscrew, and will press and even crush till Refractories give\r\n      way,—King’s _Veto_ steps in, with magical paralysis; and your\r\n      thumbscrew, hardly squeezing, much less crushing, does not act!\r\n\r\n      Truly a melancholy Set of Decrees, a pair of Sets; paralysed by\r\n      _Veto!_ First, under date the 28th of October 1791, we have\r\n      Legislative Proclamation, issued by herald and bill-sticker;\r\n      inviting Monsieur, the King’s Brother to return within two\r\n      months, under penalties. To which invitation Monsieur replies\r\n      nothing; or indeed replies by Newspaper Parody, inviting the\r\n      august Legislative “to return to common sense within two months,”\r\n      under penalties. Whereupon the Legislative must take stronger\r\n      measures. So, on the 9th of November, we declare all Emigrants to\r\n      be “suspect of conspiracy;” and, in brief, to be “outlawed,” if\r\n      they have not returned at Newyear’s-day:—Will the King say\r\n      _Veto?_ That “triple impost” shall be levied on these men’s\r\n      Properties, or even their Properties be “put in sequestration,”\r\n      one can understand. But further, on Newyear’s-day itself, not an\r\n      individual having “returned,” we declare, and with fresh emphasis\r\n      some fortnight later again declare, That Monsieur is _déchu_,\r\n      forfeited of his eventual Heirship to the Crown; nay more that\r\n      Condé, Calonne, and a considerable List of others are accused of\r\n      high treason; and shall be judged by our High Court of Orléans:\r\n      _Veto!_—Then again as to Nonjurant Priests: it was decreed, in\r\n      November last, that they should forfeit what Pensions they had;\r\n      be “put under inspection, under _surveillance_,” and, if need\r\n      were, be banished: _Veto!_ A still sharper turn is coming; but to\r\n      this also the answer will be, _Veto_.\r\n\r\n      _Veto_ after _Veto;_ your thumbscrew paralysed! Gods and men may\r\n      see that the Legislative is in a false position. As, alas, who is\r\n      in a true one? Voices already murmur for a “National\r\n      Convention.”[446] This poor Legislative, spurred and stung into\r\n      action by a whole France and a whole Europe, cannot act; can only\r\n      objurgate and perorate; with stormy “motions,” and motion in\r\n      which is no _way;_ with effervescence, with noise and fuliginous\r\n      fury!\r\n\r\n      What scenes in that National Hall! President jingling his\r\n      inaudible bell; or, as utmost signal of distress, clapping on his\r\n      hat; “the tumult subsiding in twenty minutes,” and this or the\r\n      other indiscreet Member sent to the Abbaye Prison for three days!\r\n      Suspected Persons must be summoned and questioned; old M. de\r\n      Sombreuil of the _Invalides_ has to give account of himself, and\r\n      why he leaves his Gates open. Unusual smoke rose from the Sèvres\r\n      Pottery, indicating conspiracy; the Potters explained that it was\r\n      Necklace-Lamotte’s _Mémoires_, bought up by her Majesty, which\r\n      they were endeavouring to suppress by fire,[447]—which\r\n      nevertheless he that runs may still read.\r\n\r\n      Again, it would seem, Duke de Brissac and the King’s\r\n      Constitutional-Guard are “making cartridges secretly in the\r\n      cellars;” a set of Royalists, pure and impure; black cut-throats\r\n      many of them, picked out of gaming houses and sinks; in all Six\r\n      thousand instead of Eighteen hundred; who evidently gloom on us\r\n      every time we enter the Château.[448] Wherefore, with infinite\r\n      debate, let Brissac and King’s Guard be _disbanded_. Disbanded\r\n      accordingly they are; after only two months of existence, for\r\n      they did not get on foot till March of this same year. So ends\r\n      briefly the King’s new Constitutional _Maison Militaire;_ he must\r\n      now be guarded by mere Swiss and blue Nationals again. It seems\r\n      the lot of Constitutional things. New Constitutional _Maison\r\n      Civile_ he would never even establish, much as Barnave urged it;\r\n      old resident Duchesses sniffed at it, and held aloof; on the\r\n      whole her Majesty thought it not worth while, the Noblesse would\r\n      so soon be back triumphant.[449]\r\n\r\n      Or, looking still into this National Hall and its scenes, behold\r\n      Bishop Torné, a Constitutional Prelate, not of severe morals,\r\n      demanding that “religious costumes and such caricatures” be\r\n      abolished. Bishop Torné warms, catches fire; finishes by untying,\r\n      and indignantly flinging on the table, as if for gage or bet, his\r\n      own pontifical cross. Which cross, at any rate, is instantly\r\n      covered by the cross of _Te-Deum_ Fauchet, then by other crosses,\r\n      and insignia, till all are stripped; this clerical Senator\r\n      clutching off his skull-cap, that other his frill-collar,—lest\r\n      Fanaticism return on us.[450]\r\n\r\n      Quick is the movement here! And then so confused, unsubstantial,\r\n      you might call it almost _spectral;_ pallid, dim, inane, like the\r\n      Kingdoms of Dis! Unruly Liguet, shrunk to a kind of spectre for\r\n      us, pleads here, some cause that he has: amid rumour and\r\n      interruption, which excel human patience; he “tears his papers,\r\n      and withdraws,” the irascible adust little man. Nay honourable\r\n      members will tear their papers, being effervescent: Merlin of\r\n      Thionville tears his papers, crying: ‘So, the People cannot be\r\n      saved by _you!_’ Nor are Deputations wanting: Deputations of\r\n      Sections; generally with complaint and denouncement, always with\r\n      Patriot fervour of sentiment: Deputation of Women, pleading that\r\n      they also may be allowed to take Pikes, and exercise in the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars. Why not, ye Amazons, if it be in you? Then\r\n      occasionally, having done our message and got answer, we “defile\r\n      through the Hall, singing _ça-ira;_” or rather roll and whirl\r\n      through it, “dancing our _ronde patriotique_ the while,”—our new\r\n      _Carmagnole_, or Pyrrhic war-dance and liberty-dance. Patriot\r\n      Huguenin, Ex-Advocate, Ex-Carabineer, Ex-Clerk of the Barriers,\r\n      comes deputed, with Saint-Antoine at his heels; denouncing\r\n      Anti-patriotism, Famine, Forstalment and Man-eaters; asks an\r\n      august Legislative: ‘Is there not a _tocsin in your hearts_\r\n      against these _mangeurs d’hommes!_’[451]\r\n\r\n      But above all things, for this is a continual business, the\r\n      Legislative has to reprimand the King’s Ministers. Of His\r\n      Majesty’s Ministers we have said hitherto, and say, next to\r\n      nothing. Still more spectral these! Sorrowful; of no permanency\r\n      any of them, none at least since Montmorin vanished: the “eldest\r\n      of the King’s Council” is occasionally not ten days old![452]\r\n      Feuillant-Constitutional, as your respectable Cahier de Gerville,\r\n      as your respectable unfortunate Delessarts; or\r\n      Royalist-Constitutional, as Montmorin last Friend of Necker; or\r\n      Aristocrat as Bertrand-Moleville: they flit there phantom-like,\r\n      in the huge simmering confusion; poor shadows, dashed in the\r\n      racking winds; powerless, without meaning;—whom the human memory\r\n      need not charge itself with.\r\n\r\n      But how often, we say, are these poor Majesty’s Ministers\r\n      summoned over; to be questioned, tutored; nay, threatened, almost\r\n      bullied! They answer what, with adroitest simulation and\r\n      casuistry, they can: of which a poor Legislative knows not what\r\n      to make. One thing only is clear, That Cimmerian Europe is\r\n      girdling us in; that France (not actually dead, surely?) cannot\r\n      march. Have a care, ye Ministers! Sharp Guadet transfixes you\r\n      with cross-questions, with sudden Advocate-conclusions; the\r\n      sleeping tempest that is in Vergniaud can be awakened. Restless\r\n      Brissot brings up Reports, Accusations, endless thin Logic; it is\r\n      the man’s highday even now. Condorcet redacts, with his firm pen,\r\n      our “Address of the Legislative Assembly to the French\r\n      Nation.”[453] Fiery Max Isnard, who, for the rest, will ‘carry\r\n      not Fire and Sword’ on those Cimmerian Enemies ‘but Liberty,’—is\r\n      for declaring ‘that we hold Ministers responsible; and that by\r\n      responsibility we mean death, _nous entendons la mort_.’\r\n\r\n      For verily it grows serious: the time presses, and traitors there\r\n      are. Bertrand-Moleville has a smooth tongue, the known\r\n      Aristocrat; gall in his heart. How his answers and explanations\r\n      flow ready; jesuitic, plausible to the ear! But perhaps the\r\n      notablest is this, which befell once when Bertrand had done\r\n      answering and was withdrawn. Scarcely had the august Assembly\r\n      begun considering what was to be done with him, when the Hall\r\n      fills with _smoke_. Thick sour smoke: no oratory, only wheezing\r\n      and barking;—irremediable; so that the august Assembly has to\r\n      adjourn![454] A miracle? Typical miracle? One knows not: only\r\n      this one seems to know, that “the Keeper of the Stoves _was\r\n      appointed_ by Bertrand” or by some underling of his!—O fuliginous\r\n      confused Kingdom of Dis, with thy Tantalus-Ixion toils, with thy\r\n      angry Fire-floods, and Streams named of Lamentation, why hast\r\n      thou not thy Lethe too, that so one might _finish?_\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.VIII.\r\n      The Jacobins.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless let not Patriotism despair. Have we not, in Paris at\r\n      least, a virtuous Pétion, a wholly Patriotic Municipality?\r\n      Virtuous Pétion, ever since November, is Mayor of Paris: in our\r\n      Municipality, the Public, for the Public is now admitted too, may\r\n      behold an energetic Danton; further, an epigrammatic slow-sure\r\n      Manuel; a resolute unrepentant Billaud-Varennes, of Jesuit\r\n      breeding; Tallien able-editor; and nothing but Patriots, better\r\n      or worse. So ran the November Elections: to the joy of most\r\n      citizens; nay the very Court supported Pétion rather than\r\n      Lafayette. And so Bailly and his Feuillants, long waning like the\r\n      Moon, had to withdraw then, making some sorrowful obeisance, into\r\n      extinction;—or indeed into worse, into lurid half-light, grimmed\r\n      by the shadow of that Red Flag of theirs, and bitter memory of\r\n      the Champ-de-Mars. How swift is the progress of things and men!\r\n      Not now does Lafayette, as on that Federation-day, when _his_\r\n      noon was, “press his sword firmly on the Fatherland’s Altar,” and\r\n      swear in sight of France: ah no; he, waning and setting ever\r\n      since that hour, hangs now, disastrous, on the edge of the\r\n      horizon; commanding one of those Three moulting Crane-flights of\r\n      Armies, in a most suspected, unfruitful, uncomfortable manner!\r\n\r\n      But, at most, cannot Patriotism, so many thousands strong in this\r\n      Metropolis of the Universe, help itself? Has it not right-hands,\r\n      pikes? Hammering of pikes, which was not to be prohibited by\r\n      Mayor Bailly, has been sanctioned by Mayor Pétion; sanctioned by\r\n      Legislative Assembly. How not, when the King’s so-called\r\n      Constitutional Guard “was making cartridges in secret?” Changes\r\n      are necessary for the National Guard itself; this whole\r\n      Feuillant-Aristocrat Staff of the Guard must be disbanded.\r\n      Likewise, citizens without uniform may surely rank in the Guard,\r\n      the pike beside the musket, in such a time: the “active” citizen\r\n      and the passive who can fight for us, are they not both\r\n      welcome?—O my Patriot friends, indubitably Yes! Nay the truth is,\r\n      Patriotism throughout, were it never so white-frilled, logical,\r\n      respectable, must either lean itself heartily on Sansculottism,\r\n      the black, bottomless; or else vanish, in the frightfullest way,\r\n      to Limbo! Thus some, with upturned nose, will altogether sniff\r\n      and disdain Sansculottism; others will lean heartily on it; nay\r\n      others again will lean what we call _heartlessly_ on it: three\r\n      sorts; each sort with a destiny corresponding.[455]\r\n\r\n      In such point of view, however, have we not for the present a\r\n      Volunteer Ally, stronger than all the rest: namely, Hunger?\r\n      Hunger; and what rushing of Panic Terror this and the sum-total\r\n      of our other miseries may bring! For Sansculottism grows by what\r\n      all other things die of. Stupid Peter Baille almost made an\r\n      epigram, though unconsciously, and with the Patriot world\r\n      laughing not at it but at him, when he wrote “_Tout va bien ici,\r\n      le pain manque_, All goes well here, victuals not to be\r\n      had.”[456]\r\n\r\n      Neither, if you knew it, is Patriotism without her Constitution\r\n      that _can_ march; her _not_ impotent Parliament; or call it,\r\n      Ecumenic Council, and General-Assembly of the Jean-Jacques\r\n      Churches: the MOTHER-SOCIETY, namely! Mother-Society with her\r\n      three hundred full-grown Daughters; with what we can call little\r\n      Granddaughters trying to walk, in every village of France,\r\n      numerable, as Burke thinks, by the hundred thousand. This is the\r\n      true Constitution; made not by Twelve-Hundred august Senators,\r\n      but by Nature herself; and has grown, unconsciously, out of the\r\n      wants and the efforts of these Twenty-five Millions of men. They\r\n      are “Lords of the Articles,” our Jacobins; they originate debates\r\n      for the Legislative; discuss Peace and War; settle beforehand\r\n      what the Legislative is to do. Greatly to the scandal of\r\n      philosophical men, and of most Historians;—who do in that judge\r\n      naturally, and yet not wisely. A Governing power must exist: your\r\n      other powers here are simulacra; this power is _it._\r\n\r\n      Great is the Mother Society: She has had the honour to be\r\n      denounced by Austrian Kaunitz;[457] and is all the dearer to\r\n      Patriotism. By fortune and valour, she has extinguished\r\n      Feuillantism itself, at least the Feuillant Club. This latter,\r\n      high as it once carried its head, she, on the 18th of February,\r\n      has the satisfaction to see shut, extinct; Patriots having gone\r\n      thither, with tumult, to hiss it out of pain. The Mother Society\r\n      has enlarged her locality, stretches now over the whole nave of\r\n      the Church. Let us glance in, with the worthy Toulongeon, our old\r\n      Ex-Constituent Friend, who happily has eyes to see: “The nave of\r\n      the Jacobins Church,” says he, “is changed into a vast Circus,\r\n      the seats of which mount up circularly like an amphitheatre to\r\n      the very groin of the domed roof. A high Pyramid of black marble,\r\n      built against one of the walls, which was formerly a funeral\r\n      monument, has alone been left standing: it serves now as back to\r\n      the Office-bearers’ Bureau. Here on an elevated Platform sit\r\n      President and Secretaries, behind and above them the white Busts\r\n      of Mirabeau, of Franklin, and various others, nay finally of\r\n      Marat. Facing this is the Tribune, raised till it is midway\r\n      between floor and groin of the dome, so that the speaker’s voice\r\n      may be in the centre. From that point, thunder the voices which\r\n      shake all Europe: down below, in silence, are forging the\r\n      thunderbolts and the firebrands. Penetrating into this huge\r\n      circuit, where all is out of measure, gigantic, the mind cannot\r\n      repress some movement of terror and wonder; the imagination\r\n      recalls those dread temples which Poetry, of old, had consecrated\r\n      to the Avenging Deities.”[458]\r\n\r\n      Scenes too are in this Jacobin Amphitheatre,—had History time for\r\n      them. Flags of the “Three free Peoples of the Universe,” trinal\r\n      brotherly flags of England, America, France, have been waved here\r\n      in concert; by London Deputation, of Whigs or _Wighs_ and their\r\n      Club, on this hand, and by young French Citizenesses on that;\r\n      beautiful sweet-tongued Female Citizens, who solemnly send over\r\n      salutation and brotherhood, also Tricolor stitched by their own\r\n      needle, and finally Ears of Wheat; while the dome rebellows with\r\n      _Vivent les trois peuples libres!_ from all throats:—a most\r\n      dramatic scene. Demoiselle Théroigne recites, from that Tribune\r\n      in mid air, her persecutions in Austria; comes leaning on the arm\r\n      of Joseph Chénier, Poet Chénier, to demand Liberty for the\r\n      hapless Swiss of Château-Vieux.[459] Be of hope, ye Forty Swiss;\r\n      tugging there, in the Brest waters; _not_ forgotten!\r\n\r\n      Deputy Brissot perorates from that Tribune; Desmoulins, our\r\n      wicked Camille, interjecting audibly from below, ‘_Coquin!_’\r\n      Here, though oftener in the Cordeliers, reverberates the\r\n      lion-voice of Danton; grim Billaud-Varennes is here; Collot\r\n      d’Herbois, pleading for the Forty Swiss; tearing a passion to\r\n      rags. Apophthegmatic Manuel winds up in this pithy way: ‘A\r\n      Minister must perish!’—to which the Amphitheatre responds:\r\n      ‘_Tous, Tous_, All, All!’ But the Chief Priest and Speaker of\r\n      this place, as we said, is Robespierre, the long-winded\r\n      incorruptible man. What spirit of Patriotism dwelt in men in\r\n      those times, this one fact, it seems to us, will evince: that\r\n      fifteen hundred human creatures, not bound to it, sat quiet under\r\n      the oratory of Robespierre; nay, listened nightly, hour after\r\n      hour, applausive; and gaped as for the word of life. More\r\n      insupportable individual, one would say, seldom opened his mouth\r\n      in any Tribune. Acrid, implacable-impotent; dull-drawling, barren\r\n      as the Harmattan-wind! He pleads, in endless earnest-shallow\r\n      speech, against immediate War, against Woollen Caps or _Bonnets\r\n      Rouges_, against many things; and is the Trismegistus and\r\n      Dalai-Lama of Patriot men. Whom nevertheless a shrill-voiced\r\n      little man, yet with fine eyes, and a broad beautifully sloping\r\n      brow, rises respectfully to controvert: he is, say the Newspaper\r\n      Reporters, “M. Louvet, Author of the charming Romance of\r\n      _Faublas_.” Steady, ye Patriots! Pull not _yet_ two ways; with a\r\n      France rushing panic-stricken in the rural districts, and a\r\n      Cimmerian Europe storming in on you!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.IX.\r\n      Minister Roland.\r\n\r\n      About the vernal equinox, however, one unexpected gleam of hope\r\n      does burst forth on Patriotism: the appointment of a thoroughly\r\n      Patriot Ministry. This also his Majesty, among his innumerable\r\n      experiments of wedding fire to water, will try. _Quod bonum sit_.\r\n      Madame d’Udon’s Breakfasts have jingled with a new significance;\r\n      not even Genevese Dumont but had a word in it. Finally, on the\r\n      15th and onwards to the 23d day of March, 1792, when all is\r\n      negociated,—this is the blessed issue; this Patriot Ministry that\r\n      we see.\r\n\r\n      General Dumouriez, with the Foreign Portfolio shall ply Kaunitz\r\n      and the Kaiser, in another style than did poor Delessarts; whom\r\n      indeed we have sent to our High Court of Orléans for his\r\n      sluggishness. War-minister Narbonne is washed away by the\r\n      Time-flood; poor Chevalier de Grave, chosen by the Court, is fast\r\n      washing away: then shall austere Servan, able Engineer-Officer,\r\n      mount suddenly to the War Department. Genevese Clavière sees an\r\n      old omen realized: passing the Finance Hotel, long years ago, as\r\n      a poor Genevese Exile, it was borne wondrously on his mind that\r\n      _he_ was to be Finance Minister; and now he is it;—and his poor\r\n      Wife, given up by the Doctors, rises and walks, not the victim of\r\n      nerves but their vanquisher.[460] And above all, our Minister of\r\n      the Interior? Roland de la Platrière, he of Lyons! So have the\r\n      Brissotins, public or private Opinion, and Breakfasts in the\r\n      Place Vendôme decided it. Strict Roland, compared to a _Quaker\r\n      endimanché_, or Sunday Quaker, goes to kiss hands at the\r\n      Tuileries, in round hat and sleek hair, his shoes tied with mere\r\n      riband or ferrat! The Supreme Usher twitches Dumouriez aside:\r\n      ‘_Quoi, Monsieur!_ No buckles to his shoes?’—‘Ah, Monsieur,’\r\n      answers Dumouriez, glancing towards the ferrat: ‘All is lost,\r\n      _Tout est perdu_.’[461]\r\n\r\n      And so our fair Roland removes from her upper floor in the Rue\r\n      Saint-Jacques, to the sumptuous saloons once occupied by Madame\r\n      Necker. Nay still earlier, it was Calonne that did all this\r\n      gilding; it was he who ground these lustres, Venetian mirrors;\r\n      who polished this inlaying, this veneering and or-moulu; and made\r\n      it, by rubbing of the proper _lamp_, an Aladdin’s Palace:—and now\r\n      behold, he wanders dim-flitting over Europe, half-drowned in the\r\n      Rhine-stream, scarcely saving his Papers! _Vos non vobis_.—The\r\n      fair Roland, equal to either fortune, has her public Dinner on\r\n      Fridays, the Ministers all there in a body: she withdraws to her\r\n      desk (the cloth once removed), and seems busy writing;\r\n      nevertheless loses no word: if for example Deputy Brissot and\r\n      Minister Clavière get too hot in argument, she, not without\r\n      timidity, yet with a cunning gracefulness, will interpose. Deputy\r\n      Brissot’s head, they say, is getting giddy, in this sudden\r\n      height: as feeble heads do.\r\n\r\n      Envious men insinuate that the Wife Roland is Minister, and not\r\n      the Husband: it is happily the worst they have to charge her\r\n      with. For the rest, let whose head soever be getting giddy, it is\r\n      not this brave woman’s. Serene and queenly here, as she was of\r\n      old in her own hired garret of the Ursulines Convent! She who has\r\n      quietly shelled French-beans for her dinner; being led to that,\r\n      as a young maiden, by quiet insight and computation; and knowing\r\n      what that was, and what she was: such a one will also look\r\n      quietly on or-moulu and veneering, not ignorant of these either.\r\n      Calonne did the veneering: he gave dinners here, old Besenval\r\n      diplomatically whispering to him; and was great: yet Calonne we\r\n      saw at last “walk with long strides.” Necker next: and where now\r\n      is Necker? Us also a swift change has brought hither; a swift\r\n      change will send us hence. Not a Palace but a Caravansera!\r\n\r\n      So wags and wavers this unrestful World, day after day, month\r\n      after month. The Streets of Paris, and all Cities, roll daily\r\n      their oscillatory flood of men; which flood does, nightly,\r\n      disappear, and lie hidden horizontal in beds and trucklebeds; and\r\n      awakes on the morrow to new perpendicularity and movement. Men go\r\n      their roads, foolish or wise;—Engineer Goguelat to and fro,\r\n      bearing Queen’s cipher. A Madame de Staël is busy; cannot clutch\r\n      her Narbonne from the Time-flood: a Princess de Lamballe is busy;\r\n      cannot help her Queen. Barnave, seeing the Feuillants dispersed,\r\n      and Coblentz so brisk, begs by way of final recompence to kiss\r\n      her Majesty’s hand; augurs not well of her new course; and\r\n      retires home to Grenoble, to wed an heiress there. The Café\r\n      Valois and Méot the Restaurateur’s hear daily gasconade; loud\r\n      babble of Half-pay Royalists, with or without Poniards; remnants\r\n      of Aristocrat saloons call the new Ministry\r\n      _Ministère-Sansculotte_. A Louvet, of the Romance _Faublas_, is\r\n      busy in the Jacobins. A Cazotte, of the Romance _Diable\r\n      Amoureux_, is busy elsewhere: better wert thou quiet, old\r\n      Cazotte; it is a world, this, of magic become _real!_ All men are\r\n      busy; doing they only half guess what:—flinging seeds, of tares\r\n      mostly, into the ‘Seed-field of TIME’ this, by and by, will\r\n      declare wholly what.\r\n\r\n      But Social Explosions have in them something dread, and as it\r\n      were mad and magical: which indeed Life always secretly has; thus\r\n      the dumb Earth (says Fable), if you pull her mandrake-roots, will\r\n      give a dæmonic mad-making _moan_. These Explosions and Revolts\r\n      ripen, break forth like dumb dread Forces of Nature; and yet they\r\n      are Men’s forces; and yet _we_ are part of them: the Dæmonic that\r\n      is in man’s life has burst out on us, will sweep us too away!—One\r\n      day here is like another, and yet it is not like but different.\r\n      How much is growing, silently resistless, at all moments!\r\n      Thoughts are growing; forms of Speech are growing, and Customs\r\n      and even Costumes; still more visibly are actions and\r\n      transactions growing, and that doomed Strife, of France with\r\n      herself and with the whole world.\r\n\r\n      The word _Liberty_ is never named now except in conjunction with\r\n      another; _Liberty_ and _Equality_. In like manner, what, in a\r\n      reign of Liberty and Equality, can these words, “Sir,” “obedient\r\n      Servant,” “Honour to be,” and such like, signify? Tatters and\r\n      fibres of old Feudality; which, were it only in the Grammatical\r\n      province, ought to be rooted out! The Mother Society has long\r\n      since had proposals to that effect: these she could not\r\n      entertain, not at the moment. Note too how the Jacobin Brethren\r\n      are mounting new symbolical headgear: the Woollen Cap or\r\n      Nightcap, _bonnet de laine_, better known as _bonnet rouge_, the\r\n      colour being _red_. A thing one wears not only by way of Phrygian\r\n      Cap-of-Liberty, but also for convenience” sake, and then also in\r\n      compliment to the Lower-class Patriots and Bastille-Heroes; for\r\n      the Red Nightcap combines all the three properties. Nay cockades\r\n      themselves begin to be made of wool, of tricolor yarn: the\r\n      riband-cockade, as a symptom of Feuillant Upper-class temper, is\r\n      becoming suspicious. Signs of the times.\r\n\r\n      Still more, note the travail-throes of Europe: or, rather, note\r\n      the birth she brings; for the successive throes and shrieks, of\r\n      Austrian and Prussian Alliance, of Kaunitz Anti-jacobin Despatch,\r\n      of French Ambassadors cast out, and so forth, were long to note.\r\n      Dumouriez corresponds with Kaunitz, Metternich, or Cobentzel, in\r\n      another style that Delessarts did. Strict becomes stricter;\r\n      categorical answer, as to this Coblentz work and much else, shall\r\n      be given. Failing which? Failing which, on the 20th day of April\r\n      1792, King and Ministers step over to the Salle de Manége;\r\n      promulgate how the matter stands; and poor Louis, “with tears in\r\n      his eyes,” proposes that the Assembly do now decree War. After\r\n      due eloquence, War is decreed that night.\r\n\r\n      War, indeed! Paris came all crowding, full of expectancy, to the\r\n      morning, and still more to the evening session. D’Orléans with\r\n      his two sons, is there; looks on, wide-eyed, from the opposite\r\n      Gallery.[462] Thou canst look, O Philippe: it is a War big with\r\n      issues, for thee and for all men. Cimmerian Obscurantism and this\r\n      thrice glorious Revolution shall wrestle for it, then: some\r\n      Four-and-twenty years; in immeasurable Briareus’ wrestle;\r\n      trampling and tearing; before they can come to any, not\r\n      agreement, but compromise, and approximate ascertainment each of\r\n      what is in the other.\r\n\r\n      Let our Three Generals on the Frontiers look to it, therefore;\r\n      and poor Chevalier de Grave, the Warminister, consider what he\r\n      will do. What is in the three Generals and Armies we may guess.\r\n      As for poor Chevalier de Grave, he, in this whirl of things all\r\n      coming to a press and pinch upon him, loses head, and merely\r\n      whirls with them, in a totally distracted manner; signing himself\r\n      at last, “De Grave, _Mayor of Paris;_” whereupon he demits,\r\n      returns over the Channel, to walk in Kensington Gardens;[463] and\r\n      austere Servan, the able Engineer-Officer, is elevated in his\r\n      stead. To the post of Honour? To that of Difficulty, at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.X.\r\n      Pétion-National-Pique.\r\n\r\n      And yet, how, on dark bottomless Cataracts there plays the\r\n      foolishest fantastic-coloured spray and shadow; hiding the Abyss\r\n      under vapoury rainbows! Alongside of this discussion as to\r\n      Austrian-Prussian War, there goes on no less but more vehemently\r\n      a discussion, Whether the Forty or Two-and-forty Swiss of\r\n      Château-Vieux shall be liberated from the Brest Gallies? And\r\n      then, Whether, being liberated, they shall have a public\r\n      Festival, or only private ones?\r\n\r\n      Théroigne, as we saw, spoke; and Collot took up the tale. Has not\r\n      Bouillé’s final display of himself, in that final Night of Spurs,\r\n      stamped your so-called “Revolt of Nanci” into a “Massacre of\r\n      Nanci,” for all Patriot judgments? Hateful is that massacre;\r\n      hateful the Lafayette-Feuillant “public thanks” given for it! For\r\n      indeed, Jacobin Patriotism and dispersed Feuillantism are now at\r\n      death-grips; and do fight with all weapons, even with scenic\r\n      shows. The walls of Paris, accordingly, are covered with Placard\r\n      and Counter-Placard, on the subject of Forty Swiss blockheads.\r\n      Journal responds to Journal; Player Collot to Poetaster Roucher;\r\n      Joseph Chénier the Jacobin, squire of Théroigne, to his Brother\r\n      Andre the Feuillant; Mayor Pétion to Dupont de Nemours: and for\r\n      the space of two months, there is nowhere peace for the thought\r\n      of man,—till this thing be settled.\r\n\r\n      _Gloria in excelsis!_ The Forty Swiss are at last got\r\n      “amnestied.” Rejoice ye Forty: doff your greasy wool Bonnets,\r\n      which shall become Caps of Liberty. The Brest Daughter-Society\r\n      welcomes you from on board, with kisses on each cheek: your iron\r\n      Handcuffs are disputed as Relics of Saints; the Brest Society\r\n      indeed can have one portion, which it will beat into Pikes, a\r\n      sort of Sacred Pikes; but the other portion must belong to Paris,\r\n      and be suspended from the dome there, along with the Flags of the\r\n      Three Free Peoples! Such a goose is man; and cackles over\r\n      plush-velvet Grand Monarques and woollen Galley-slaves; over\r\n      everything and over nothing,—and will cackle with his whole soul\r\n      merely if others cackle!\r\n\r\n      On the ninth morning of April, these Forty Swiss blockheads\r\n      arrive. From Versailles; with _vivats_ heaven-high; with the\r\n      affluence of men and women. To the Townhall we conduct them; nay\r\n      to the Legislative itself, though not without difficulty. They\r\n      are harangued, bedinnered, begifted,—the very Court, _not_ for\r\n      conscience” sake, contributing something; and their Public\r\n      Festival shall be next Sunday. Next Sunday accordingly it\r\n      is.[464] They are mounted into a “triumphal Car resembling a\r\n      ship;” are carted over Paris, with the clang of cymbals and\r\n      drums, all mortals assisting applausive; carted to the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars and Fatherland’s Altar; and finally carted, for\r\n      Time always brings deliverance,—into invisibility for evermore.\r\n\r\n      Whereupon dispersed Feuillantism, or that Party which loves\r\n      Liberty yet not more than Monarchy, will likewise have its\r\n      Festival: Festival of Simonneau, unfortunate Mayor of Etampes,\r\n      who died for the Law; most surely for the Law, though Jacobinism\r\n      disputes; being trampled down with his Red Flag in the riot about\r\n      grains. At which Festival the Public again assists,\r\n      _un_applausive: not we.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, Festivals are not wanting; beautiful rainbow-spray\r\n      when all is now rushing treble-quick towards its Niagara Fall.\r\n      National repasts there are; countenanced by Mayor Pétion;\r\n      Saint-Antoine, and the Strong Ones of the Halles defiling through\r\n      Jacobin Club, ‘their felicity,’ according to Santerre, ‘not\r\n      perfect otherwise;’ singing many-voiced their _ça-ira_, dancing\r\n      their _ronde patriotique_. Among whom one is glad to discern\r\n      Saint-Huruge, expressly “in white hat,” the Saint-Christopher of\r\n      the Carmagnole. Nay a certain _Tambour_ or National Drummer,\r\n      having just been presented with a little daughter, determines to\r\n      have the new Frenchwoman christened on Fatherland’s Altar then\r\n      and there. Repast once over, he accordingly has her christened;\r\n      Fauchet the Te-Deum Bishop acting in chief, Thuriot and\r\n      honourable persons standing gossips: by the name,\r\n      Pétion-National-Pique![465] Does this remarkable Citizeness, now\r\n      past the meridian of life, still walk the Earth? Or did she die\r\n      perhaps of teething? Universal History is not indifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.XI.\r\n      The Hereditary Representative.\r\n\r\n      And yet it is not by carmagnole-dances and singing of _ça-ira_,\r\n      that the work can be done. Duke Brunswick is not dancing\r\n      carmagnoles, but has his drill serjeants busy.\r\n\r\n      On the Frontiers, our Armies, be it treason or not, behave in the\r\n      worst way. Troops badly commanded, shall we say? Or troops\r\n      intrinsically bad? Unappointed, undisciplined, mutinous; that, in\r\n      a thirty-years peace, have never seen fire? In any case,\r\n      Lafayette’s and Rochambeau’s little clutch, which they made at\r\n      Austrian Flanders, has prospered as badly as clutch need do:\r\n      soldiers starting at their own shadow; suddenly shrieking, ‘_On\r\n      nous trahit_,’ and flying off in wild panic, at or before the\r\n      first shot;—managing only to hang some two or three Prisoners\r\n      they had picked up, and massacre their own Commander, poor\r\n      Theobald Dillon, driven into a granary by them in the Town of\r\n      Lille.\r\n\r\n      And poor Gouvion: he who sat shiftless in that Insurrection of\r\n      Women! Gouvion quitted the Legislative Hall and Parliamentary\r\n      duties, in disgust and despair, when those Galley-slaves of\r\n      Château-Vieux were admitted there. He said, ‘Between the\r\n      Austrians and the Jacobins there is nothing but a soldier’s death\r\n      for it;’[466] and so, “in the dark stormy night,” he has flung\r\n      himself into the throat of the Austrian cannon, and perished in\r\n      the skirmish at Maubeuge on the ninth of June. Whom Legislative\r\n      Patriotism shall mourn, with black mortcloths and melody in the\r\n      Champ-de-Mars: many a Patriot shiftier, truer none. Lafayette\r\n      himself is looking altogether dubious; in place of beating the\r\n      Austrians, is about writing to denounce the Jacobins. Rochambeau,\r\n      all disconsolate, quits the service: there remains only Lückner,\r\n      the babbling old Prussian Grenadier.\r\n\r\n      Without Armies, without Generals! And the Cimmerian Night, _has_\r\n      gathered itself; Brunswick preparing his Proclamation; just about\r\n      to march! Let a Patriot Ministry and Legislative say, what in\r\n      these circumstances it will do? Suppress Internal Enemies, for\r\n      one thing, answers the Patriot Legislative; and proposes, on the\r\n      24th of May, its Decree for the Banishment of Priests. Collect\r\n      also some nucleus of determined internal friends, adds\r\n      War-minister Servan; and proposes, on the 7th of June, his Camp\r\n      of Twenty-thousand. Twenty-thousand National Volunteers; Five out\r\n      of each Canton; picked Patriots, for Roland has charge of the\r\n      Interior: they shall assemble here in Paris; and be for a\r\n      defence, cunningly devised, against foreign Austrians and\r\n      domestic _Austrian Committee_ alike. So much can a Patriot\r\n      Ministry and Legislative do.\r\n\r\n      Reasonable and cunningly devised as such Camp may, to Servan and\r\n      Patriotism, appear, it appears not so to Feuillantism; to that\r\n      Feuillant-Aristocrat Staff of the Paris Guard; a Staff, one would\r\n      say again, which will need to be _dissolved_. These men see, in\r\n      this proposed Camp of Servan’s, an offence; and even, as they\r\n      pretend to say, an insult. Petitions there come, in consequence,\r\n      from blue Feuillants in epaulettes; ill received. Nay, in the\r\n      end, there comes one Petition, called “of the Eight Thousand\r\n      National Guards:” so many names are on it; including women and\r\n      children. Which famed Petition of the Eight Thousand is indeed\r\n      received: and the Petitioners, all under arms, are admitted to\r\n      the honours of the sitting,—if honours or even if sitting there\r\n      be; for the instant their bayonets appear at the one door, the\r\n      Assembly “adjourns,” and begins to flow out at the other.[467]\r\n\r\n      Also, in these same days, it is lamentable to see how National\r\n      Guards, escorting _Fête Dieu_ or _Corpus-Christi_ ceremonial, do\r\n      collar and smite down any Patriot that does not uncover as the\r\n      Hostie passes. They clap their bayonets to the breast of\r\n      Cattle-butcher Legendre, a known Patriot ever since the Bastille\r\n      days; and threaten to butcher him; though he sat quite\r\n      respectfully, he says, in his Gig, at a distance of fifty paces,\r\n      waiting till the thing were by. Nay, orthodox females were\r\n      shrieking to have down the _Lanterne_ on him.[468]\r\n\r\n      To such height has Feuillantism gone in this Corps. For indeed,\r\n      are not their Officers creatures of the chief Feuillant,\r\n      Lafayette? The Court too has, very naturally, been tampering with\r\n      them; caressing them, ever since that dissolution of the\r\n      so-called Constitutional Guard. Some Battalions are altogether\r\n      “_pétris_, kneaded full” of Feuillantism, mere Aristocrats at\r\n      bottom: for instance, the Battalion of the _Filles-Saint-Thomas_,\r\n      made up of your Bankers, Stockbrokers, and other Full-purses of\r\n      the Rue Vivienne. Our worthy old Friend Weber, Queen’s\r\n      Foster-brother Weber, carries a musket in that Battalion,—one may\r\n      judge with what degree of Patriotic intention.\r\n\r\n      Heedless of all which, or rather heedful of all which, the\r\n      Legislative, backed by Patriot France and the feeling of\r\n      Necessity, decrees this Camp of Twenty thousand. Decisive though\r\n      conditional Banishment of malign Priests, it has already decreed.\r\n\r\n      It will now be seen, therefore, Whether the Hereditary\r\n      Representative is for us or against us? Whether or not, to all\r\n      our other woes, this intolerablest one is to be added; which\r\n      renders us not a menaced Nation in extreme jeopardy and need, but\r\n      a paralytic Solecism of a Nation; sitting wrapped as in dead\r\n      cerements, of a Constitutional-Vesture that were no other than a\r\n      winding-sheet; our right hand glued to our left: to wait there,\r\n      writhing and wriggling, unable to stir from the spot, till in\r\n      Prussian rope we mount to the gallows? Let the Hereditary\r\n      Representative consider it well: The Decree of Priests? The Camp\r\n      of Twenty Thousand?—By Heaven, he answers, _Veto! Veto!_—Strict\r\n      Roland hands in his _Letter to the King;_ or rather it was\r\n      Madame’s Letter, who wrote it all at a sitting; one of the\r\n      plainest-spoken Letters ever handed in to any King. This\r\n      plain-spoken Letter King Louis has the benefit of reading\r\n      overnight. He reads, inwardly digests; and next morning, the\r\n      whole Patriot Ministry finds itself turned out. It is the 13th of\r\n      June 1792.[469]\r\n\r\n      Dumouriez the many-counselled, he, with one Duranthon, called\r\n      Minister of Justice, does indeed linger for a day or two; in\r\n      rather suspicious circumstances; speaks with the Queen, almost\r\n      weeps with her: but in the end, he too sets off for the Army;\r\n      leaving what Un-Patriot or Semi-Patriot Ministry and Ministries\r\n      can now accept the helm, to accept it. Name them not: new\r\n      quick-changing Phantasms, which shift like magic-lantern figures;\r\n      more spectral than ever!\r\n\r\n      Unhappy Queen, unhappy Louis! The two _Vetos_ were so natural:\r\n      are not the Priests martyrs; also friends? This Camp of Twenty\r\n      Thousand, could it be other than of stormfullest Sansculottes?\r\n      Natural; and yet, to France, unendurable. Priests that co-operate\r\n      with Coblentz must go elsewhither with their martyrdom: stormful\r\n      Sansculottes, these and no other kind of creatures, will drive\r\n      back the Austrians. If thou prefer the Austrians, then for the\r\n      love of Heaven go join them. If not, join frankly with what will\r\n      oppose them to the death. Middle course is none.\r\n\r\n      Or alas, what extreme course was there left now, for a man like\r\n      Louis? Underhand Royalists, Ex-Minister Bertrand-Moleville,\r\n      Ex-Constituent Malouet, and all manner of unhelpful individuals,\r\n      advise and advise. With face of hope turned now on the\r\n      Legislative Assembly, and now on Austria and Coblentz, and round\r\n      generally on the Chapter of Chances, an ancient Kingship is\r\n      reeling and spinning, one knows not whitherward, on the flood of\r\n      things.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.5.XII.\r\n      Procession of the Black Breeches.\r\n\r\n      But is there a thinking man in France who, in these\r\n      circumstances, can persuade himself that the Constitution will\r\n      march? Brunswick is stirring; _he_, in few days now, will march.\r\n      Shall France sit still, wrapped in dead cerements and\r\n      grave-clothes, its right hand glued to its left, till the\r\n      Brunswick Saint-Bartholomew arrive; till France be as Poland, and\r\n      its Rights of Man become a Prussian Gibbet?\r\n\r\n      Verily, it is a moment frightful for all men. National Death; or\r\n      else some preternatural convulsive outburst of National\r\n      Life;—that same, _dæmonic_ outburst! Patriots whose audacity has\r\n      limits had, in truth, better retire like Barnave; court private\r\n      felicity at Grenoble. Patriots, whose audacity has no limits must\r\n      sink down into the obscure; and, daring and defying all things,\r\n      seek salvation in stratagem, in Plot of Insurrection. Roland and\r\n      young Barbaroux have spread out the Map of France before them,\r\n      Barbaroux says “with tears:” they consider what Rivers, what\r\n      Mountain ranges are in it: they will retire behind this\r\n      Loire-stream, defend these Auvergne stone-labyrinths; save some\r\n      little sacred Territory of the Free; die at least in their last\r\n      ditch. Lafayette indites his emphatic Letter to the Legislative\r\n      against Jacobinism;[470] which emphatic Letter will not heal the\r\n      unhealable.\r\n\r\n      Forward, ye Patriots whose audacity has no limits; it is you now\r\n      that must either do or die! The sections of Paris sit in deep\r\n      counsel; send out Deputation after Deputation to the Salle de\r\n      Manége, to petition and denounce. Great is their ire against\r\n      tyrannous _Veto, Austrian Committee_, and the combined Cimmerian\r\n      Kings. What boots it? Legislative listens to the “tocsin in our\r\n      hearts;” grants us honours of the sitting, sees us defile with\r\n      jingle and fanfaronade; but the Camp of Twenty Thousand, the\r\n      Priest-Decree, be-vetoed by Majesty, are become impossible for\r\n      Legislative. Fiery Isnard says, ‘We will have Equality, should we\r\n      descend for it to the tomb.’ Vergniaud utters, hypothetically,\r\n      his stern Ezekiel-visions of the fate of Anti-national Kings. But\r\n      the question is: Will hypothetic prophecies, will jingle and\r\n      fanfaronade demolish the _Veto;_ or will the Veto, secure in its\r\n      Tuileries Château, remain undemolishable by these? Barbaroux,\r\n      dashing away his tears, writes to the Marseilles Municipality,\r\n      that they must send him “Six hundred men who know how to die,\r\n      _qui savent mourir_.”[471] No wet-eyed message this, but a\r\n      fire-eyed one;—which will be obeyed!\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile the Twentieth of June is nigh, anniversary of that\r\n      world-famous Oath of the Tennis-Court: on which day, it is said,\r\n      certain citizens have in view to plant a _Mai_ or Tree of\r\n      Liberty, in the Tuileries Terrace of the Feuillants; perhaps also\r\n      to petition the Legislative and Hereditary Representative about\r\n      these Vetos;—with such demonstration, jingle and evolution, as\r\n      may seem profitable and practicable. Sections have gone singly,\r\n      and jingled and evolved: but if they all went, or great part of\r\n      them, and there, planting their _Mai_ in these alarming\r\n      circumstances, sounded the tocsin in their hearts?\r\n\r\n      Among King’s Friends there can be but one opinion as to such a\r\n      step: among Nation’s Friends there may be two. On the one hand,\r\n      might it not by possibility scare away these unblessed Vetos?\r\n      Private Patriots and even Legislative Deputies may have each his\r\n      own opinion, or own no-opinion: but the hardest task falls\r\n      evidently on Mayor Pétion and the Municipals, at once Patriots\r\n      and Guardians of the public Tranquillity. Hushing the matter down\r\n      with the one hand; tickling it up with the other! Mayor Pétion\r\n      and Municipality may lean this way; Department-Directory with\r\n      Procureur-Syndic Rœderer having a Feuillant tendency, may lean\r\n      that. On the whole, each man must act according to his one\r\n      opinion or to his two opinions; and all manner of influences,\r\n      official representations cross one another in the foolishest way.\r\n      Perhaps after all, the Project, desirable and yet not desirable,\r\n      will dissipate itself, being run athwart by so many complexities;\r\n      and coming to nothing?\r\n\r\n      Not so: on the Twentieth morning of June, a large Tree of\r\n      Liberty, Lombardy Poplar by kind, lies visibly tied on its car,\r\n      in the Suburb-Antoine. Suburb Saint-Marceau too, in the uttermost\r\n      South-East, and all that remote Oriental region, Pikemen and\r\n      Pikewomen, National Guards, and the unarmed curious are\r\n      gathering,—with the peaceablest intentions in the world. A\r\n      tricolor Municipal arrives; speaks. Tush, it is all peaceable, we\r\n      tell thee, in the way of Law: are not Petitions allowable, and\r\n      the Patriotism of _Mais?_ The tricolor Municipal returns without\r\n      effect: your Sansculottic rills continue flowing, combining into\r\n      brooks: towards noontide, led by tall Santerre in blue uniform,\r\n      by tall Saint-Huruge in white hat, it moves Westward, a\r\n      respectable river, or complication of still-swelling rivers.\r\n\r\n      What Processions have we not seen: _Corpus-Christi_ and Legendre\r\n      waiting in Gig; Bones of Voltaire with bullock-chariots, and\r\n      goadsmen in Roman Costume; Feasts of Château-Vieux and Simonneau;\r\n      Gouvion Funerals, Rousseau Sham-Funerals, and the Baptism of\r\n      Pétion-National-Pike! Nevertheless this Procession has a\r\n      character of its own. Tricolor ribands streaming aloft from\r\n      pike-heads; ironshod batons; and emblems not a few; among which,\r\n      see specially these two, of the tragic and the untragic sort: a\r\n      Bull’s Heart transfixed with iron, bearing this epigraph, “_Cœur\r\n      d’Aristocrate_, Aristocrat’s Heart;” and, more striking still,\r\n      properly the standard of the host, a pair of old Black Breeches\r\n      (silk, they say), extended on cross-staff high overhead, with\r\n      these memorable words: “_Tremblez tyrans, voilà les\r\n      Sansculottes_, Tremble tyrants, here are the\r\n      Sans-indispensables!” Also, the Procession trails two cannons.\r\n\r\n      Scarfed tricolor Municipals do now again meet it, in the Quai\r\n      Saint-Bernard; and plead earnestly, having called halt.\r\n      Peaceable, ye virtuous tricolor Municipals, peaceable are we as\r\n      the sucking dove. Behold our Tennis-Court _Mai_. Petition is\r\n      legal; and as for arms, did not an august Legislative receive the\r\n      so-called Eight Thousand in arms, Feuillants though they were?\r\n      Our Pikes, are they not of National iron? Law is our father and\r\n      mother, whom we will not dishonour; but Patriotism is our own\r\n      soul. Peaceable, ye virtuous Municipals;—and on the whole,\r\n      limited as to time! Stop we cannot; march ye with us.—The Black\r\n      Breeches agitate themselves, impatient; the cannon-wheels\r\n      grumble: the many-footed Host tramps on.\r\n\r\n      How it reached the Salle de Manége, like an ever-waxing river;\r\n      got admittance, after debate; read its Address; and defiled,\r\n      dancing and _ça-ira_-ing, led by tall sonorous Santerre and tall\r\n      sonorous Saint-Huruge: how it flowed, not now a waxing river but\r\n      a shut Caspian lake, round all Precincts of the Tuileries; the\r\n      front Patriot squeezed by the rearward, against barred iron\r\n      Grates, like to have the life squeezed out of him, and looking\r\n      too into the dread throat of cannon, for National Battalions\r\n      stand ranked within: how tricolor Municipals ran assiduous, and\r\n      Royalists with Tickets of Entry; and both Majesties sat in the\r\n      interior surrounded by men in black: all this the human mind\r\n      shall fancy for itself, or read in old Newspapers, and Syndic\r\n      Rœderer’s _Chronicle of Fifty Days_.[472]\r\n\r\n      Our _Mai_ is planted; if not in the Feuillants Terrace, whither\r\n      is no ingate, then in the Garden of the Capuchins, as near as we\r\n      could get. National Assembly has adjourned till the Evening\r\n      Session: perhaps this shut lake, finding no ingate, will retire\r\n      to its sources again; and disappear in peace? Alas, not yet:\r\n      rearward still presses on; rearward knows little what pressure is\r\n      in the front. One would wish at all events, were it possible, to\r\n      have a word with his Majesty first!\r\n\r\n      The shadows fall longer, eastward; it is four o’clock: will his\r\n      Majesty not come out? Hardly he! In that case, Commandant\r\n      Santerre, Cattle-butcher Legendre, Patriot Huguenin with the\r\n      tocsin in his heart; they, and others of authority, will enter\r\n      _in_. Petition and request to wearied uncertain National Guard;\r\n      louder and louder petition; backed by the rattle of our two\r\n      cannons! The reluctant Grate opens: endless Sansculottic\r\n      multitudes flood the stairs; knock at the wooden guardian of your\r\n      privacy. Knocks, in such case, grow strokes, grow smashings: the\r\n      wooden guardian flies in shivers. And now ensues a Scene over\r\n      which the world has long wailed; and not unjustly; for a sorrier\r\n      spectacle, of Incongruity fronting Incongruity, and as it were\r\n      recognising themselves incongruous, and staring stupidly in each\r\n      other’s face, the world seldom saw.\r\n\r\n      King Louis, his door being beaten on, opens it; stands with free\r\n      bosom; asking, ‘What do you want?’ The Sansculottic flood recoils\r\n      awestruck; returns however, the rear pressing on the front, with\r\n      cries of ‘Veto! Patriot Ministers! Remove Veto!’—which things,\r\n      Louis valiantly answers, this is not the time to do, nor this the\r\n      way to ask him to do. Honour what virtue is in a man. Louis does\r\n      not want courage; he has even the higher kind called\r\n      moral-courage, though only the passive half of that. His few\r\n      National Grenadiers shuffle back with him, into the embrasure of\r\n      a window: there he stands, with unimpeachable passivity, amid the\r\n      shouldering and the braying; a spectacle to men. They hand him a\r\n      Red Cap of Liberty; he sets it quietly on his head, forgets it\r\n      there. He complains of thirst; half-drunk Rascality offers him a\r\n      bottle, he drinks of it. ‘Sire, do not fear,’ says one of his\r\n      Grenadiers. ‘Fear?’ answers Louis: ‘feel then,’ putting the man’s\r\n      hand on his heart. So stands Majesty in Red woollen Cap; black\r\n      Sansculottism weltering round him, far and wide, aimless, with\r\n      in-articulate dissonance, with cries of ‘Veto! Patriot\r\n      Ministers!’\r\n\r\n      For the space of three hours or more! The National Assembly is\r\n      adjourned; tricolor Municipals avail almost nothing: Mayor Pétion\r\n      tarries absent; Authority is none. The Queen with her Children\r\n      and Sister Elizabeth, in tears and terror not for themselves\r\n      only, are sitting behind barricaded tables and Grenadiers in an\r\n      inner room. The Men in Black have all wisely disappeared. Blind\r\n      lake of Sansculottism welters stagnant through the King’s\r\n      Château, for the space of three hours.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless all things do end. Vergniaud arrives with\r\n      Legislative Deputation, the Evening Session having now opened.\r\n      Mayor Pétion has arrived; is haranguing, “lifted on the shoulders\r\n      of two Grenadiers.” In this uneasy attitude and in others, at\r\n      various places without and within, Mayor Pétion harangues; many\r\n      men harangue: finally Commandant Santerre defiles; passes out,\r\n      with his Sansculottism, by the opposite side of the Château.\r\n      Passing through the room where the Queen, with an air of dignity\r\n      and sorrowful resignation, sat among the tables and Grenadiers, a\r\n      woman offers her too a Red Cap; she holds it in her hand, even\r\n      puts it on the little Prince Royal. ‘Madame,’ said Santerre,\r\n      ‘this People loves you more than you think.’[473]—About eight\r\n      o’clock the Royal Family fall into each other’s arms amid\r\n      “torrents of tears.” Unhappy Family! Who would not weep for it,\r\n      were there not a whole world to be wept for?\r\n\r\n      Thus has the Age of Chivalry gone, and that of Hunger come. Thus\r\n      does all-needing Sansculottism look in the face of its _Roi_,\r\n      Regulator, King or Ableman; and find that _he_ has nothing to\r\n      give it. Thus do the two Parties, brought face to face after long\r\n      centuries, stare stupidly at one another, _This, verily, am I;\r\n      but, Good Heaven, is that Thou?_—and depart, not knowing what to\r\n      make of it. And yet, Incongruities having recognised themselves\r\n      to be incongruous, something must be made of it. The Fates know\r\n      what.\r\n\r\n      This is the world-famous Twentieth of June, more worthy to be\r\n      called the _Procession of the Black Breeches_. With which, what\r\n      we had to say of this First French biennial Parliament, and its\r\n      products and activities, may perhaps fitly enough terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 2.VI.\r\n      THE MARSEILLESE\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.I.\r\n      Executive that does not act.\r\n\r\n      How could your paralytic National Executive be put “in action,”\r\n      in any measure, by such a Twentieth of June as this? Quite\r\n      contrariwise: a large sympathy for Majesty so insulted arises\r\n      every where; expresses itself in Addresses, Petitions, “Petition\r\n      of the Twenty Thousand inhabitants of Paris,” and such like,\r\n      among all Constitutional persons; a decided rallying round the\r\n      Throne.\r\n\r\n      Of which rallying it was thought King Louis might have made\r\n      something. However, he does make nothing of it, or attempt to\r\n      make; for indeed his views are lifted beyond domestic sympathy\r\n      and rallying, over to Coblentz mainly: neither in itself is the\r\n      same sympathy worth much. It is sympathy of men who believe still\r\n      that the Constitution can march. Wherefore the old discord and\r\n      ferment, of Feuillant sympathy for Royalty, and Jacobin sympathy\r\n      for Fatherland, acting against each other from within; with\r\n      terror of Coblentz and Brunswick acting from without:—this\r\n      discord and ferment must hold on its course, till a catastrophe\r\n      do ripen and come. One would think, especially as Brunswick is\r\n      near marching, such catastrophe cannot now be distant. Busy, ye\r\n      Twenty-five French Millions; ye foreign Potentates, minatory\r\n      Emigrants, German drill-serjeants; each do what his hand findeth!\r\n      Thou, O Reader, at such safe distance, wilt see what they make of\r\n      it among them.\r\n\r\n      Consider therefore this pitiable Twentieth of June as a futility;\r\n      no catastrophe, rather a _catastasis_, or heightening. Do not its\r\n      Black Breeches wave there, in the Historical Imagination, like a\r\n      melancholy flag of distress; soliciting help, which no mortal can\r\n      give? Soliciting pity, which thou wert hard-hearted not to give\r\n      freely, to one and all! Other such flags, or what are called\r\n      Occurrences, and black or bright symbolic Phenomena; will flit\r\n      through the Historical Imagination: these, one after one, let us\r\n      note, with extreme brevity.\r\n\r\n      The first phenomenon is that of Lafayette at the Bar of the\r\n      Assembly; after a week and day. Promptly, on hearing of this\r\n      scandalous Twentieth of June, Lafayette has quitted his Command\r\n      on the North Frontier, in better or worse order; and got hither,\r\n      on the 28th, to repress the Jacobins: not by Letter now; but by\r\n      oral Petition, and weight of character, face to face. The august\r\n      Assembly finds the step questionable; invites him meanwhile to\r\n      the honours of the sitting.[474] Other honour, or advantage,\r\n      there unhappily came almost none; the Galleries all growling;\r\n      fiery Isnard glooming; sharp Guadet not wanting in sarcasms.\r\n\r\n      And out of doors, when the sitting is over, Sieur Resson, keeper\r\n      of the Patriot _Café_ in these regions, hears in the street a\r\n      hurly-burly; steps forth to look, he and his Patriot customers:\r\n      it is Lafayette’s carriage, with a tumultuous escort of blue\r\n      Grenadiers, Cannoneers, even Officers of the Line, hurrahing and\r\n      capering round it. They make a pause opposite Sieur Resson’s\r\n      door; wag their plumes at him; nay shake their fists, bellowing\r\n      _À bas les Jacobins!_ but happily pass on without onslaught. They\r\n      pass on, to plant a _Mai_ before the General’s door, and bully\r\n      considerably. All which the Sieur Resson cannot but report with\r\n      sorrow, that night, in the Mother Society.[475] But what no Sieur\r\n      Resson nor Mother Society can do more than guess is this, That a\r\n      council of rank Feuillants, your unabolished Staff of the Guard\r\n      and who else has status and weight, is in these very moments\r\n      privily deliberating at the General’s: Can we not put down the\r\n      Jacobins by force? Next day, a Review shall be held, in the\r\n      Tuileries Garden, of such as will turn out, and try. Alas, says\r\n      Toulongeon, hardly a hundred turned out. Put it off till\r\n      tomorrow, then, to give better warning. On the morrow, which is\r\n      Saturday, there turn out “some thirty;” and depart shrugging\r\n      their shoulders![476] Lafayette promptly takes carriage again;\r\n      returns musing on many things.\r\n\r\n      The dust of Paris is hardly off his wheels, the summer Sunday is\r\n      still young, when Cordeliers in deputation pluck up that _Mai_ of\r\n      his: before sunset, Patriots have burnt him in effigy. Louder\r\n      doubt and louder rises, in Section, in National Assembly, as to\r\n      the legality of such unbidden Anti-jacobin visit on the part of a\r\n      General: doubt swelling and spreading all over France, for six\r\n      weeks or so: with endless talk about usurping soldiers, about\r\n      English Monk, nay about Cromwell: O thou pour\r\n      _Grandison_-Cromwell!—What boots it? King Louis himself looked\r\n      coldly on the enterprize: colossal Hero of two Worlds, having\r\n      weighed himself in the balance, finds that he is become a\r\n      gossamer Colossus, only some thirty turning out.\r\n\r\n      In a like sense, and with a like issue, works our\r\n      Department-Directory here at Paris; who, on the 6th of July, take\r\n      upon them to suspend Mayor Pétion and Procureur Manuel from all\r\n      civic functions, for their conduct, replete, as is alleged, with\r\n      omissions and commissions, on that delicate Twentieth of June.\r\n      Virtuous Pétion sees himself a kind of martyr, or pseudo-martyr,\r\n      threatened with several things; drawls out due heroical\r\n      lamentation; to which Patriot Paris and Patriot Legislative duly\r\n      respond. King Louis and Mayor Pétion have already had an\r\n      interview on that business of the Twentieth; an interview and\r\n      dialogue, distinguished by frankness on both sides; ending on\r\n      King Louis’s side with the words, ‘_Taisez-vous_, Hold your\r\n      peace.’\r\n\r\n      For the rest, this of suspending our Mayor does seem a mistimed\r\n      measure. By ill chance, it came out precisely on the day of that\r\n      famous _Baiser de l’amourette_, or miraculous reconciliatory\r\n      Delilah-Kiss, which we spoke of long ago. Which Delilah-Kiss was\r\n      thereby quite hindered of effect. For now his Majesty has to\r\n      write, almost that same night, asking a reconciled Assembly for\r\n      advice! The reconciled Assembly will not advise; will not\r\n      interfere. The King confirms the suspension; then perhaps, but\r\n      not till then will the Assembly interfere, the noise of Patriot\r\n      Paris getting loud. Whereby your Delilah-Kiss, such was the\r\n      destiny of Parliament First, becomes a Philistine Battle!\r\n\r\n      Nay there goes a word that as many as Thirty of our chief Patriot\r\n      Senators are to be clapped in prison, by mittimus and indictment\r\n      of Feuillant Justices, _Juges de Paix;_ who here in Paris were\r\n      well capable of such a thing. It was but in May last that _Juge\r\n      de Paix Larivière_, on complaint of Bertrand-Moleville touching\r\n      that _Austrian Committee_, made bold to launch his mittimus\r\n      against three heads of the Mountain, Deputies Bazire, Chabot,\r\n      Merlin, the Cordelier Trio; summoning them to appear before\r\n      _him_, and shew where that Austrian Committee was, or else suffer\r\n      the consequences. Which mittimus the Trio, on their side, made\r\n      bold to fling in the fire: and valiantly pleaded privilege of\r\n      Parliament. So that, for his zeal without knowledge, poor Justice\r\n      Larivière now sits in the prison of Orléans, waiting trial from\r\n      the _Haute Cour_ there. Whose example, may it not deter other\r\n      rash Justices; and so this word of the Thirty arrestments\r\n      continue a word merely?\r\n\r\n      But on the whole, though Lafayette weighed so light, and has had\r\n      his _Mai_ plucked up, Official Feuillantism falters not a whit;\r\n      but carries its head high, strong in the letter of the Law.\r\n      Feuillants all of these men: a Feuillant Directory; founding on\r\n      high character, and such like; with Duke de la Rochefoucault for\r\n      President,—a thing which may prove dangerous for him! Dim now is\r\n      the once bright Anglomania of these admired Noblemen. Duke de\r\n      Liancourt offers, out of Normandy where he is Lord-Lieutenant,\r\n      not only to receive his Majesty, thinking of flight thither, but\r\n      to lend him money to enormous amounts. Sire, it is not a Revolt,\r\n      it is a Revolution; and truly no rose-water one! Worthier\r\n      Noblemen were not in France nor in Europe than those two: but the\r\n      Time is crooked, quick-shifting, perverse; what straightest\r\n      course will lead to any goal, in _it?_\r\n\r\n      Another phasis which we note, in these early July days, is that\r\n      of certain thin streaks of Federate National Volunteers wending\r\n      from various points towards Paris, to hold a new\r\n      Federation-Festival, or Feast of Pikes, on the Fourteenth there.\r\n      So has the National Assembly wished it, so has the Nation willed\r\n      it. In this way, perhaps, may we still have our Patriot Camp in\r\n      spite of _Veto_. For cannot these Fédérés, having celebrated\r\n      their Feast of Pikes, march on to Soissons; and, there being\r\n      drilled and regimented, rush to the Frontiers, or whither we\r\n      like? Thus were the one _Veto_ cunningly eluded!\r\n\r\n      As indeed the other _Veto_, about Priests, is also like to be\r\n      eluded; and without much cunning. For Provincial Assemblies, in\r\n      Calvados as one instance, are proceeding on their own strength to\r\n      judge and banish Antinational Priests. Or still worse without\r\n      Provincial Assembly, a desperate People, as at Bourdeaux, can\r\n      “hang two of them on the Lanterne,” on the way towards\r\n      judgment.[477] Pity for the spoken _Veto_, when it cannot become\r\n      an acted one!\r\n\r\n      It is true, some ghost of a War-minister, or Home-minister, for\r\n      the time being, ghost whom we do not name, does write to\r\n      Municipalities and King’s Commanders, that they shall, by all\r\n      conceivable methods, obstruct this Federation, and even turn back\r\n      the Fédérés by force of arms: a message which scatters mere\r\n      doubt, paralysis and confusion; irritates the poor Legislature;\r\n      reduces the Fédérés as we see, to thin streaks. But being\r\n      questioned, this ghost and the other ghosts, What it is then that\r\n      they propose to do for saving the country?—they answer, That they\r\n      cannot tell; that indeed they for their part have, this morning,\r\n      resigned in a body; and do now merely respectfully take leave of\r\n      the helm altogether. With which words they rapidly walk out of\r\n      the Hall, _sortent brusquement de la salle_, the “Galleries\r\n      cheering loudly,” the poor Legislature sitting “for a good while\r\n      in silence!”[478] Thus do Cabinet-ministers themselves, in\r\n      extreme cases, strike work; one of the strangest omens. Other\r\n      complete Cabinet-ministry there will not be; only fragments, and\r\n      these changeful, which never get completed; spectral Apparitions\r\n      that cannot so much as appear! King Louis writes that he now\r\n      views this Federation Feast with approval; and will himself have\r\n      the pleasure to take part in the same.\r\n\r\n      And so these thin streaks of Fédérés wend Parisward through a\r\n      paralytic France. Thin grim streaks; not thick joyful ranks, as\r\n      of old to the first Feast of Pikes! No: these poor Federates\r\n      march now towards Austria and Austrian Committee, towards\r\n      jeopardy and forlorn hope; men of hard fortune and temper, not\r\n      rich in the world’s goods. Municipalities, paralyzed by\r\n      War-ministers, are shy of affording cash: it may be, your poor\r\n      Federates cannot arm themselves, cannot march, till the\r\n      Daughter-Society of the place open her pocket, and subscribe.\r\n      There will not have arrived, at the set day, Three thousand of\r\n      them in all. And yet, thin and feeble as these streaks of\r\n      Federates seem, they are the only thing one discerns moving with\r\n      any clearness of aim, in this strange scene. Angry buzz and\r\n      simmer; uneasy tossing and moaning of a huge France, all\r\n      enchanted, spell-bound by unmarching Constitution, into frightful\r\n      conscious and unconscious Magnetic-sleep; which frightful\r\n      Magnetic-sleep must now issue soon in one of two things: Death or\r\n      Madness! The Fédérés carry mostly in their pocket some earnest\r\n      cry and Petition, to have the “National Executive put in action;”\r\n      or as a step towards that, to have the King’s _Déchéance_, King’s\r\n      Forfeiture, or at least his Suspension, pronounced. They shall be\r\n      welcome to the Legislative, to the Mother of Patriotism; and\r\n      Paris will provide for their lodging.\r\n\r\n      _Déchéance_, indeed: and, what next? A France spell-free, a\r\n      Revolution saved; and any thing, and all things next! so answer\r\n      grimly Danton and the unlimited Patriots, down deep in their\r\n      subterranean region of Plot, whither they have now dived.\r\n      _Déchéance_, answers Brissot with the limited: And if next the\r\n      little Prince Royal were crowned, and some Regency of Girondins\r\n      and recalled Patriot Ministry set over him? Alas, poor Brissot;\r\n      looking, as indeed poor man does always, on the nearest morrow as\r\n      his peaceable promised land; deciding what must reach to the\r\n      world’s end, yet with an insight that reaches not beyond his own\r\n      nose! Wiser are the unlimited subterranean Patriots, who with\r\n      light for the hour itself, leave the rest to the gods.\r\n\r\n      Or were it not, as we now stand, the probablest issue of all,\r\n      that Brunswick, in Coblentz, just gathering his huge limbs\r\n      towards him to rise, might arrive first; and stop both\r\n      _Déchéance_, and theorizing on it? Brunswick is on the eve of\r\n      marching; with Eighty Thousand, they say; fell Prussians,\r\n      Hessians, feller Emigrants: a General of the Great Frederick,\r\n      with such an Army. And our Armies? And our Generals? As for\r\n      Lafayette, on whose late visit a Committee is sitting and all\r\n      France is jarring and censuring, he seems readier to fight _us_\r\n      than fight Brunswick. Lückner and Lafayette pretend to be\r\n      interchanging corps, and are making movements; which Patriotism\r\n      cannot understand. This only is very clear, that their corps go\r\n      marching and shuttling, in the interior of the country; much\r\n      nearer Paris than formerly! Lückner has ordered Dumouriez down to\r\n      him, down from Maulde, and the Fortified Camp there. Which order\r\n      the many-counselled Dumouriez, with the Austrians hanging close\r\n      on him, he busy meanwhile training a few thousands to stand fire\r\n      and be soldiers, declares that, come of it what will, he cannot\r\n      obey.[479] Will a poor Legislative, therefore, sanction\r\n      Dumouriez; who applies to it, “not knowing whether there is any\r\n      War-ministry?” Or sanction Lückner and these Lafayette movements?\r\n\r\n      The poor Legislative knows not what to do. It decrees, however,\r\n      that the Staff of the Paris Guard, and indeed all such Staffs,\r\n      for they are Feuillants mostly, shall be broken and replaced. It\r\n      decrees earnestly in what manner one can declare that the\r\n      _Country is in Danger_. And finally, on the 11th of July, the\r\n      morrow of that day when the Ministry struck work, it decrees that\r\n      _the Country be_, with all despatch, _declared in Danger_.\r\n      Whereupon let the King sanction; let the Municipality take\r\n      measures: if such Declaration will do service, _it_ need not\r\n      fail.\r\n\r\n      In Danger, truly, if ever Country was! Arise, O Country; or be\r\n      trodden down to ignominious ruin! Nay, are not the chances a\r\n      hundred to one that no rising of the Country will save it;\r\n      Brunswick, the Emigrants, and Feudal Europe drawing nigh?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.II.\r\n      Let us march.\r\n\r\n      But to our minds the notablest of all these moving phenomena, is\r\n      that of Barbaroux’s “Six Hundred Marseillese who know how to\r\n      die.”\r\n\r\n      Prompt to the request of Barbaroux, the Marseilles Municipality\r\n      has got these men together: on the fifth morning of July, the\r\n      Townhall says, ‘_Marchez, abatez le Tyran_, March, strike down\r\n      the Tyrant;’[480] and they, with grim appropriate ‘_Marchons_,’\r\n      are marching. Long journey, doubtful errand; _Enfans de la\r\n      Patrie_, may a good genius guide you! Their own wild heart and\r\n      what faith it has will guide them: and is not that the monition\r\n      of some genius, better or worse? Five Hundred and Seventeen able\r\n      men, with Captains of fifties and tens; well armed all, musket on\r\n      shoulder, sabre on thigh: nay they drive three pieces of cannon;\r\n      for who knows what obstacles may occur? Municipalities there are,\r\n      paralyzed by War-minister; Commandants with orders to stop even\r\n      Federation Volunteers; good, when sound arguments will not open a\r\n      Town-gate, if you have a petard to shiver it! They have left\r\n      their sunny Phocean City and Sea-haven, with its bustle and its\r\n      bloom: the thronging _Course_, with high-frondent Avenues, pitchy\r\n      dockyards, almond and olive groves, orange trees on house-tops,\r\n      and white glittering _bastides_ that crown the hills, are all\r\n      behind them. They wend on their wild way, from the extremity of\r\n      French land, through unknown cities, toward an unknown destiny;\r\n      with a purpose that they know.\r\n\r\n      Much wondering at this phenomenon, and how, in a peaceable\r\n      trading City, so many householders or hearth-holders do severally\r\n      fling down their crafts and industrial tools; gird themselves\r\n      with weapons of war, and set out on a journey of six hundred\r\n      miles to “strike down the tyrant,”—you search in all Historical\r\n      Books, Pamphlets, and Newspapers, for some light on it: unhappily\r\n      without effect. Rumour and Terror precede this march; which still\r\n      echo on you; the march itself an unknown thing. Weber, in the\r\n      back-stairs of the Tuileries, has understood that they were\r\n      _Forçats_, Galley-slaves and mere scoundrels, these Marseillese;\r\n      that, as they marched through Lyons, the people shut their\r\n      shops;—also that the number of them was some Four _Thousand_.\r\n      Equally vague is Blanc Gilli, who likewise murmurs about\r\n      _Forçats_ and danger of plunder.[481] _Forçats_ they were not;\r\n      neither was there plunder, or danger of it. Men of regular life,\r\n      or of the best-filled purse, they could hardly be; the one thing\r\n      needful in them was that they “knew how to die.” Friend\r\n      Dampmartin saw them, with his own eyes, march “gradually” through\r\n      his quarters at Villefranche in the Beaujolais: but saw in the\r\n      vaguest manner; being indeed preoccupied, and himself minded for\r\n      matching just then—across the Rhine. Deep was his astonishment to\r\n      think of such a march, without appointment or arrangement,\r\n      station or ration: for the rest it was “the same men he had seen\r\n      formerly” in the troubles of the South; “perfectly civil;” though\r\n      his soldiers could not be kept from talking a little with\r\n      them.[482]\r\n\r\n      So vague are all these; _Moniteur, Histoire Parlementaire_ are as\r\n      good as silent: garrulous History, as is too usual, will say\r\n      nothing where you most wish her to speak! If enlightened\r\n      Curiosity ever get sight of the Marseilles Council-Books, will it\r\n      not perhaps explore this strangest of Municipal procedures; and\r\n      feel called to fish up what of the Biographies, creditable or\r\n      discreditable, of these Five Hundred and Seventeen, the stream of\r\n      Time has not yet irrevocably swallowed?\r\n\r\n      As it is, these Marseillese remain inarticulate,\r\n      undistinguishable in feature; a blackbrowed Mass, full of grim\r\n      fire, who wend there, in the hot sultry weather: very singular to\r\n      contemplate. They wend; amid the infinitude of doubt and dim\r\n      peril; they not doubtful: Fate and Feudal Europe, having decided,\r\n      come girdling in from without: they, having also decided, do\r\n      march within. Dusty of face, with frugal refreshment, they plod\r\n      onwards; unweariable, not to be turned aside. Such march will\r\n      become famous. The Thought, which works voiceless in this\r\n      blackbrowed mass, an inspired Tyrtæan Colonel, Rouget de Lille,\r\n      whom the Earth still holds,[483] has translated into grim melody\r\n      and rhythm; into his _Hymn_ or March _of the Marseillese:_\r\n      luckiest musical-composition ever promulgated. The sound of which\r\n      will make the blood tingle in men’s veins; and whole Armies and\r\n      Assemblages will sing it, with eyes weeping and burning, with\r\n      hearts defiant of Death, Despot and Devil.\r\n\r\n      One sees well, these Marseillese will be too late for the\r\n      Federation Feast. In fact, it is not Champ-de-Mars Oaths that\r\n      they have in view. They have quite another feat to do: a\r\n      paralytic National Executive to set in action. They must “strike\r\n      down” whatsoever “Tyrant,” or Martyr-Fainéant, there may be who\r\n      paralyzes it; strike and be struck; and on the whole prosper and\r\n      know how to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.III.\r\n      Some Consolation to Mankind.\r\n\r\n      Of the Federation Feast itself we shall say almost nothing. There\r\n      are Tents pitched in the Champ-de-Mars; tent for National\r\n      Assembly; tent for Hereditary Representative,—who indeed is there\r\n      too early, and has to wait long in it. There are Eighty-three\r\n      symbolical Departmental Trees-of-Liberty; trees and _mais_\r\n      enough: beautifullest of all these is one huge _mai_, hung round\r\n      with effete Scutcheons, Emblazonries and Genealogy-books; nay\r\n      better still, with Lawyers’-bags, “_sacs de procédure:_” which\r\n      shall be burnt. The Thirty seat-rows of that famed Slope are\r\n      again full; we have a bright Sun; and all is marching,\r\n      streamering and blaring: but what avails it? Virtuous Mayor\r\n      Pétion, whom Feuillantism had suspended, was reinstated only last\r\n      night, by Decree of the Assembly. Men’s humour is of the sourest.\r\n      Men’s hats have on them, written in chalk, “_Vive Pétion;_” and\r\n      even, “Pétion or Death, _Pétion ou la Mort_.”\r\n\r\n      Poor Louis, who has waited till five o’clock before the Assembly\r\n      would arrive, swears the National Oath this time, with a quilted\r\n      cuirass under his waistcoat which will turn pistol-bullets.[484]\r\n      Madame de Staël, from that Royal Tent, stretches out the neck in\r\n      a kind of agony, lest the waving multitudes which receive him may\r\n      not render him back alive. No cry of _Vive le Roi_ salutes the\r\n      ear; cries only of _Vive Pétion; Pétion ou la Mort_. The National\r\n      Solemnity is as it were huddled by; each cowering off almost\r\n      before the evolutions are gone through. The very _Mai_ with its\r\n      Scutcheons and Lawyers’-bags is forgotten, stands unburnt; till\r\n      “certain Patriot Deputies,” called by the people, set a torch to\r\n      it, by way of voluntary after-piece. Sadder Feast of Pikes no man\r\n      ever saw.\r\n\r\n      Mayor Pétion, named on hats, is at his zenith in this Federation;\r\n      Lafayette again is close upon his nadir. Why does the stormbell\r\n      of Saint-Roch speak out, next Saturday; why do the citizens shut\r\n      their shops?[485] It is Sections defiling, it is fear of\r\n      effervescence. Legislative Committee, long deliberating on\r\n      Lafayette and that Anti-jacobin Visit of his, reports, this day,\r\n      that there is “_not_ ground for Accusation!” Peace, ye Patriots,\r\n      nevertheless; and let that tocsin cease: the Debate is not\r\n      finished, nor the Report accepted; but Brissot, Isnard and the\r\n      Mountain will sift it, and resift it, perhaps for some three\r\n      weeks longer.\r\n\r\n      So many bells, stormbells and noises do ring;—scarcely audible;\r\n      one drowning the other. For example: in this same Lafayette\r\n      tocsin, of Saturday, was there not withal some faint bob-minor,\r\n      and Deputation of Legislative, ringing the Chevalier Paul Jones\r\n      to his long rest; tocsin or dirge now all one to him! Not ten\r\n      days hence Patriot Brissot, beshouted this day by the Patriot\r\n      Galleries, shall find himself begroaned by them, on account of\r\n      his limited Patriotism; nay pelted at while perorating, and “hit\r\n      with two prunes.”[486] It is a distracted empty-sounding world;\r\n      of bob-minors and bob-majors, of triumph and terror, of rise and\r\n      fall!\r\n\r\n      The more touching is this other Solemnity, which happens on the\r\n      morrow of the Lafayette tocsin: Proclamation that the _Country is\r\n      in Danger_. Not till the present Sunday could such Solemnity be.\r\n      The Legislative decreed it almost a fortnight ago; but Royalty\r\n      and the ghost of a Ministry held back as they could. Now however,\r\n      on this Sunday, 22nd day of July 1792, it will hold back no\r\n      longer; and the Solemnity in very deed is. Touching to behold!\r\n      Municipality and Mayor have on their scarfs; cannon-salvo booms\r\n      alarm from the Pont-Neuf, and single-gun at intervals all day.\r\n      Guards are mounted, scarfed Notabilities, Halberdiers, and a\r\n      Cavalcade; with streamers, emblematic flags; especially with one\r\n      huge Flag, flapping mournfully: _Citoyens, la Patrie est en\r\n      Danger_. They roll through the streets, with stern-sounding\r\n      music, and slow rattle of hoofs: pausing at set stations, and\r\n      with doleful blast of trumpet, singing out through Herald’s\r\n      throat, what the Flag says to the eye: ‘Citizens, the Country is\r\n      in Danger!’\r\n\r\n      Is there a man’s heart that hears it without a thrill? The\r\n      many-voiced responsive hum or bellow of these multitudes is not\r\n      of triumph; and yet it is a sound deeper than triumph. But when\r\n      the long Cavalcade and Proclamation ended; and our huge Flag was\r\n      fixed on the Pont Neuf, another like it on the Hôtel-de-Ville, to\r\n      wave there till better days; and each Municipal sat in the centre\r\n      of his Section, in a Tent raised in some open square, Tent\r\n      surmounted with flags of _Patrie en Danger_, and topmost of all a\r\n      Pike and _Bonnet Rouge;_ and, on two drums in front of him, there\r\n      lay a plank-table, and on this an open Book, and a Clerk sat,\r\n      like recording-angel, ready to write the Lists, or as we say to\r\n      enlist! O, then, it seems, the very gods might have looked down\r\n      on it. Young Patriotism, Culottic and Sansculottic, rushes\r\n      forward emulous: That is my name; name, blood, and life, is all\r\n      my Country’s; why have I nothing more! Youths of short stature\r\n      weep that they are below size. Old men come forward, a son in\r\n      each hand. Mothers themselves will grant the son of their\r\n      travail; send him, though with tears. And the multitude bellows\r\n      _Vive la Patrie_, far reverberating. And fire flashes in the eyes\r\n      of men;—and at eventide, your Municipal returns to the Townhall,\r\n      followed by his long train of volunteer Valour; hands in his\r\n      List: says proudly, looking round. This is my day’s harvest.[487]\r\n      They will march, on the morrow, to Soissons; small bundle holding\r\n      all their chattels.\r\n\r\n      So, with _Vive la Patrie, Vive la Liberté_, stone Paris\r\n      reverberates like Ocean in his caves; day after day, Municipals\r\n      enlisting in tricolor Tent; the Flag flapping on Pont Neuf and\r\n      Townhall, _Citoyens, la Patrie est en Danger_. Some Ten thousand\r\n      fighters, without discipline but full of heart, are on march in\r\n      few days. The like is doing in every Town of France.—Consider\r\n      therefore whether the Country will want defenders, had we but a\r\n      National Executive? Let the Sections and Primary Assemblies, at\r\n      any rate, become Permanent, and sit continually in Paris, and\r\n      over France, by Legislative Decree dated Wednesday the 25th.[488]\r\n\r\n      Mark contrariwise how, in these very hours, dated the 25th,\r\n      Brunswick shakes himself “_s’ébranle_,” in Coblentz; and takes\r\n      the road! Shakes himself indeed; one spoken word becomes such a\r\n      shaking. Successive, simultaneous _dirl_ of thirty thousand\r\n      muskets shouldered; prance and jingle of ten-thousand horsemen,\r\n      fanfaronading Emigrants in the van; drum, kettle-drum; noise of\r\n      weeping, swearing; and the immeasurable lumbering clank of\r\n      baggage-waggons and camp-kettles that groan into motion: all this\r\n      is Brunswick shaking himself; not without all this does the one\r\n      man march, “covering a space of forty miles.” Still less without\r\n      his Manifesto, dated, as we say, the 25th; a State-Paper worthy\r\n      of attention!\r\n\r\n      By this Document, it would seem great things are in store for\r\n      France. The universal French People shall now have permission to\r\n      rally round Brunswick and his Emigrant Seigneurs; tyranny of a\r\n      Jacobin Faction shall oppress them no more; but they shall\r\n      return, and find favour with their own good King; who, by Royal\r\n      Declaration (three years ago) of the Twenty-third of June, said\r\n      that he would himself make them happy. As for National Assembly,\r\n      and other Bodies of Men invested with some temporary shadow of\r\n      authority, they are charged to maintain the King’s Cities and\r\n      Strong Places intact, till Brunswick arrive to take delivery of\r\n      them. Indeed, quick submission may extenuate many things; but to\r\n      this end it must be quick. Any National Guard or other unmilitary\r\n      person found resisting in arms shall be “treated as a traitor;”\r\n      that is to say, hanged with promptitude. For the rest, if Paris,\r\n      before Brunswick gets thither, offer any insult to the King: or,\r\n      for example, suffer a faction to carry the King away elsewhither;\r\n      in that case Paris shall be blasted asunder with cannon-shot and\r\n      “military execution.” Likewise all other Cities, which may\r\n      witness, and not resist to the uttermost, such forced-march of\r\n      his Majesty, shall be blasted asunder; and Paris and every City\r\n      of them, starting-place, course and goal of said sacrilegious\r\n      forced-march, shall, as rubbish and smoking ruin, lie there for a\r\n      sign. Such vengeance were indeed signal, “an _insigne\r\n      vengeance:_”—O Brunswick, what words thou writest and blusterest!\r\n      In this Paris, as in old Nineveh, are so many score thousands\r\n      that know not the right hand from the left, and also much cattle.\r\n      Shall the very milk-cows, hard-living cadgers’-asses, and poor\r\n      little canary-birds die?\r\n\r\n      Nor is Royal and Imperial Prussian-Austrian Declaration wanting:\r\n      setting forth, in the amplest manner, their Sanssouci-Schonbrunn\r\n      version of this whole French Revolution, since the first\r\n      beginning of it; and with what grief these high heads have seen\r\n      such things done under the Sun: however, “as some small\r\n      consolation to mankind,”[489] they do now despatch Brunswick;\r\n      regardless of expense, as one might say, of sacrifices on their\r\n      own part; for is it not the first duty to console men?\r\n\r\n      Serene Highnesses, who sit there protocolling and manifestoing,\r\n      and consoling mankind! how were it if, for once in the thousand\r\n      years, your parchments, formularies, and reasons of state were\r\n      blown to the four winds; and Reality Sans-indispensables stared\r\n      you, even you, in the face; and Mankind said for itself what the\r\n      thing was that would console it?—\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.IV.\r\n      Subterranean.\r\n\r\n      But judge if there was comfort in this to the Sections all\r\n      sitting permanent; deliberating how a National Executive could be\r\n      put in action!\r\n\r\n      High rises the response, not of cackling terror, but of crowing\r\n      counter-defiance, and _Vive la Nation;_ young Valour streaming\r\n      towards the Frontiers; _Patrie en Danger_ mutely beckoning on the\r\n      Pont Neuf. Sections are busy, in their permanent Deep; and down,\r\n      lower still, works unlimited Patriotism, seeking salvation in\r\n      plot. Insurrection, you would say, becomes once more the\r\n      sacredest of duties? Committee, self-chosen, is sitting at the\r\n      Sign of the Golden Sun: Journalist Carra, Camille Desmoulins,\r\n      Alsatian Westermann friend of Danton, American Fournier of\r\n      Martinique;—a Committee not unknown to Mayor Pétion, who, as an\r\n      official person, must sleep with one eye open. Not unknown to\r\n      Procureur Manuel; least of all to Procureur-Substitute Danton!\r\n      He, wrapped in darkness, being also official, bears it on his\r\n      giant shoulder; cloudy invisible Atlas of the whole.\r\n\r\n      Much is invisible; the very Jacobins have their reticences.\r\n      Insurrection is to be: but when? This only we can discern, that\r\n      such Fédérés as are not yet gone to Soissons, as indeed are not\r\n      inclined to go yet, ‘for reasons,’ says the Jacobin President,\r\n      ‘which it may be interesting not to state,’ have got a _Central\r\n      Committee_ sitting close by, under the roof of the Mother Society\r\n      herself. Also, what in such ferment and danger of effervescence\r\n      is surely proper, the Forty-eight Sections have got their Central\r\n      Committee; intended “for prompt communication.” To which Central\r\n      Committee the Municipality, anxious to have it at hand, could not\r\n      refuse an Apartment in the Hôtel-de-Ville.\r\n\r\n      Singular City! For overhead of all this, there is the customary\r\n      baking and brewing; Labour hammers and grinds. Frilled\r\n      promenaders saunter under the trees; white-muslin promenaderess,\r\n      in green parasol, leaning on your arm. Dogs dance, and shoeblacks\r\n      polish, on that Pont Neuf itself, where Fatherland is in danger.\r\n      So much goes its course; and yet the course of all things is nigh\r\n      altering and ending.\r\n\r\n      Look at that Tuileries and Tuileries Garden. Silent all as\r\n      Sahara; none entering save by ticket! They shut their Gates,\r\n      after the Day of the Black Breeches; a thing they had the liberty\r\n      to do. However, the National Assembly grumbled something about\r\n      Terrace of the Feuillants, how said Terrace lay contiguous to the\r\n      back entrance to their Salle, and was partly _National Property;_\r\n      and so now National Justice has stretched a Tricolor Riband\r\n      athwart, by way of boundary-line, respected with splenetic\r\n      strictness by all Patriots. It hangs there that Tricolor\r\n      boundary-line; carries “satirical inscriptions on cards,”\r\n      generally in verse; and all beyond this is called _Coblentz_, and\r\n      remains vacant; silent, as a fateful Golgotha; sunshine and\r\n      umbrage alternating on it in vain. Fateful Circuit; what hope can\r\n      dwell in it? Mysterious Tickets of Entry introduce themselves;\r\n      speak of Insurrection very imminent. Rivarol’s Staff of Genius\r\n      had better purchase blunderbusses; Grenadier bonnets, red Swiss\r\n      uniforms may be useful. Insurrection will come; but likewise will\r\n      it not be met? Staved off, one may hope, till Brunswick arrive?\r\n\r\n      But consider withal if the Bourne-stones and Portable chairs\r\n      remain silent; if the Herald’s College of Bill-Stickers sleep!\r\n      Louvet’s _Sentinel_ warns gratis on all walls; Sulleau is busy:\r\n      _People’s-Friend_ Marat and _King’s-Friend_ Royou croak and\r\n      counter-croak. For the man Marat, though long hidden since that\r\n      Champ-de-Mars Massacre, is still alive. He has lain, who knows in\r\n      what Cellars; perhaps in Legendre’s; fed by a steak of Legendre’s\r\n      killing: but, since April, the bull-frog voice of him sounds\r\n      again; hoarsest of earthly cries. For the present, black terror\r\n      haunts him: O brave Barbaroux wilt thou not smuggle me to\r\n      Marseilles, “disguised as a jockey?”[490] In Palais-Royal and all\r\n      public places, as we read, there is sharp activity; private\r\n      individuals haranguing that Valour may enlist; haranguing that\r\n      the Executive may be put in action. Royalist journals ought to be\r\n      solemnly burnt: argument thereupon; debates which generally end\r\n      in single-stick, _coups de cannes_.[491] Or think of this; the\r\n      hour midnight; place Salle de Manége; august Assembly just\r\n      adjourning: “Citizens of both sexes enter in a rush exclaiming,\r\n      _Vengeance: they are poisoning our Brothers;_”—baking\r\n      brayed-glass among their bread at Soissons! Vergniaud has to\r\n      speak soothing words, How Commissioners are already sent to\r\n      investigate this brayed-glass, and do what is needful therein:\r\n      till the rush of Citizens “makes profound silence:” and goes home\r\n      to its bed.\r\n\r\n      Such is Paris; the heart of a France like to it. Preternatural\r\n      suspicion, doubt, disquietude, nameless anticipation, from shore\r\n      to shore:—and those blackbrowed Marseillese, marching, dusty,\r\n      unwearied, through the midst of it; not doubtful they. Marching\r\n      to the grim music of their hearts, they consume continually the\r\n      long road, these three weeks and more; heralded by Terror and\r\n      Rumour. The Brest Fédérés arrive on the 26th; through hurrahing\r\n      streets. Determined men are these also, bearing or not bearing\r\n      the Sacred Pikes of Château-Vieux; and on the whole decidedly\r\n      disinclined for Soissons as yet. Surely the Marseillese Brethren\r\n      do draw nigher all days.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.V.\r\n      At Dinner.\r\n\r\n      It was a bright day for Charenton, that 29th of the month, when\r\n      the Marseillese Brethren actually came in sight. Barbaroux,\r\n      Santerre and Patriots have gone out to meet the grim Wayfarers.\r\n      Patriot clasps dusty Patriot to his bosom; there is footwashing\r\n      and refection: “dinner of twelve hundred covers at the Blue Dial,\r\n      _Cadran Bleu;_” and deep interior consultation, that one wots not\r\n      of.[492] Consultation indeed which comes to little; for Santerre,\r\n      with an open purse, with a loud voice, has almost no head. Here\r\n      however we repose this night: on the morrow is public entry into\r\n      Paris.\r\n\r\n      On which public entry the Day-Historians, _Diurnalists_, or\r\n      Journalists as they call themselves, have preserved record\r\n      enough. How Saint-Antoine male and female, and Paris generally,\r\n      gave brotherly welcome, with bravo and hand-clapping, in crowded\r\n      streets; and all passed in the peaceablest manner;—except it\r\n      might be our Marseillese pointed out here and there a\r\n      riband-cockade, and beckoned that it should be snatched away, and\r\n      exchanged for a wool one; which was done. How the Mother Society\r\n      in a body has come as far as the Bastille-ground, to embrace you.\r\n      How you then wend onwards, triumphant, to the Townhall, to be\r\n      embraced by Mayor Pétion; to put down your muskets in the\r\n      Barracks of Nouvelle France, not far off;—then towards the\r\n      appointed Tavern in the Champs Elysées to enjoy a frugal Patriot\r\n      repast.[493]\r\n\r\n      Of all which the indignant Tuileries may, by its Tickets of\r\n      Entry, have warning. Red Swiss look doubly sharp to their\r\n      Château-Grates;—though surely there is no danger? Blue Grenadiers\r\n      of the Filles-Saint-Thomas Section are on duty there this day:\r\n      men of Agio, as we have seen; with stuffed purses,\r\n      riband-cockades; among whom serves Weber. A party of these\r\n      latter, with Captains, with sundry Feuillant Notabilities, Moreau\r\n      de Saint-Méry of the three thousand orders, and others, have been\r\n      dining, much more respectably, in a Tavern hard by. They have\r\n      dined, and are now drinking Loyal-Patriotic toasts; while the\r\n      Marseillese, _National_-Patriotic merely, are about sitting down\r\n      to their frugal covers of delf. How it happened remains to this\r\n      day undemonstrable: but the external fact is, certain of these\r\n      Filles-Saint-Thomas Grenadiers do issue from their Tavern;\r\n      perhaps touched, surely not yet muddled with any liquor they have\r\n      had;—issue in the professed intention of testifying to the\r\n      Marseillese, or to the multitude of Paris Patriots who stroll in\r\n      these spaces, That they, the Filles-Saint-Thomas men, if well\r\n      seen into, are not a whit less Patriotic than any other class of\r\n      men whatever.\r\n\r\n      It was a rash errand! For how can the strolling multitudes credit\r\n      such a thing; or do other indeed than hoot at it, provoking, and\r\n      provoked;—till Grenadier sabres stir in the scabbard, and a sharp\r\n      shriek rises: ‘_À nous Marseillais_, Help Marseillese!’ Quick as\r\n      lightning, for the frugal repast is not yet served, that\r\n      Marseillese Tavern flings itself open: by door, by window;\r\n      running, bounding, vault forth the Five hundred and Seventeen\r\n      undined Patriots; and, sabre flashing from thigh, are on the\r\n      scene of controversy. Will ye parley, ye Grenadier Captains and\r\n      official Persons; “with faces grown suddenly pale,” the Deponents\r\n      say?[494] Advisabler were instant moderately swift retreat! The\r\n      Filles-Saint-Thomas retreat, back foremost; then, alas, face\r\n      foremost, at treble-quick time; the Marseillese, according to a\r\n      Deponent, ‘clearing the fences and ditches after them like lions:\r\n      Messieurs, it was an imposing spectacle.’\r\n\r\n      Thus they retreat, the Marseillese following. Swift and swifter,\r\n      towards the Tuileries: where the Drawbridge receives the bulk of\r\n      the fugitives; and, then suddenly drawn up, saves them; or else\r\n      the green mud of the Ditch does it. The bulk of them; not all;\r\n      ah, no! Moreau de Saint-Méry for example, being too fat, could\r\n      not fly fast; he got a stroke, _flat_-stroke only, over the\r\n      shoulder-blades, and fell prone;—and disappears there from the\r\n      History of the Revolution. Cuts also there were, pricks in the\r\n      posterior fleshy parts; much rending of skirts, and other\r\n      discrepant waste. But poor Sub-lieutenant Duhamel, innocent\r\n      Change-broker, what a lot for him! He turned on his pursuer, or\r\n      pursuers, with a pistol; he fired and missed; drew a second\r\n      pistol, and again fired and missed; then ran: unhappily in vain.\r\n      In the Rue Saint-Florentin, they clutched him; thrust him\r\n      through, in red rage: that was the end of the New Era, and of all\r\n      Eras, to poor Duhamel.\r\n\r\n      Pacific readers can fancy what sort of grace-before-meat this was\r\n      to frugal Patriotism. Also how the Battalion of the\r\n      Filles-Saint-Thomas “drew out in arms,” luckily without further\r\n      result; how there was accusation at the Bar of the Assembly, and\r\n      counter-accusation and defence; Marseillese challenging the\r\n      sentence of free jury court,—which never got to a decision. We\r\n      ask rather, What the upshot of all these distracted wildly\r\n      accumulating things may, by probability, be? Some upshot; and the\r\n      time draws nigh! Busy are Central Committees, of Fédérés at the\r\n      Jacobins Church, of Sections at the Townhall; Reunion of Carra,\r\n      Camille and Company at the Golden Sun. Busy: like submarine\r\n      deities, or call them mud-gods, working there in the deep murk of\r\n      waters: till the thing be ready.\r\n\r\n      And how your National Assembly, like a ship waterlogged,\r\n      helmless, lies tumbling; the Galleries, of shrill Women, of\r\n      Fédérés with sabres, bellowing down on it, not unfrightful;—and\r\n      waits where the waves of chance may please to strand it;\r\n      suspicious, nay on the Left side, conscious, what submarine\r\n      Explosion is meanwhile a-charging! Petition for King’s Forfeiture\r\n      rises often there: Petition from Paris Section, from Provincial\r\n      Patriot Towns; From Alencon, Briancon, and “the Traders at the\r\n      Fair of Beaucaire.” Or what of these? On the 3rd of August, Mayor\r\n      Pétion and the Municipality come petitioning for Forfeiture: they\r\n      openly, in their tricolor Municipal scarfs. Forfeiture is what\r\n      all Patriots now want and expect. All Brissotins want Forfeiture;\r\n      with the little Prince Royal for King, and us for Protector over\r\n      him. Emphatic Fédérés asks the legislature: ‘Can you save us, or\r\n      not?’ Forty-seven Sections have agreed to Forfeiture; only that\r\n      of the Filles-Saint-Thomas pretending to disagree. Nay Section\r\n      Mauconseil declares Forfeiture to be, properly speaking, come;\r\n      Mauconseil for one “does from this day,” the last of July, “cease\r\n      allegiance to Louis,” and take minute of the same before all men.\r\n      A thing blamed aloud; but which will be praised aloud; and the\r\n      name _Mauconseil_, of Ill-counsel, be thenceforth changed to\r\n      _Bonconseil_, of Good-counsel.\r\n\r\n      President Danton, in the Cordeliers Section, does another thing:\r\n      invites all Passive Citizens to take place among the Active in\r\n      Section-business, one peril threatening all. Thus he, though an\r\n      official person; cloudy Atlas of the whole. Likewise he manages\r\n      to have that blackbrowed Battalion of Marseillese shifted to new\r\n      Barracks, in his own region of the remote South-East. Sleek\r\n      Chaumette, cruel Billaud, Deputy Chabot the Disfrocked, Huguenin\r\n      with the tocsin in his heart, will welcome them there. Wherefore,\r\n      again and again: ‘O Legislators, can you save us or not?’ Poor\r\n      Legislators; with their Legislature waterlogged, volcanic\r\n      Explosion charging under it! Forfeiture shall be debated on the\r\n      ninth day of August; that miserable business of Lafayette may be\r\n      expected to terminate on the eighth.\r\n\r\n      Or will the humane Reader glance into the Levee-day of Sunday the\r\n      fifth? The last Levee! Not for a long time, “never,” says\r\n      Bertrand-Moleville, had a Levee been so brilliant, at least so\r\n      crowded. A sad presaging interest sat on every face; Bertrand’s\r\n      own eyes were filled with tears. For, indeed, outside of that\r\n      Tricolor Riband on the Feuillants Terrace, Legislature is\r\n      debating, Sections are defiling, all Paris is astir this very\r\n      Sunday, demanding _Déchéance_.[495] Here, however, within the\r\n      riband, a grand proposal is on foot, for the hundredth time, of\r\n      carrying his Majesty to Rouen and the Castle of Gaillon. Swiss at\r\n      Courbevoye are in readiness; much is ready; Majesty himself seems\r\n      almost ready. Nevertheless, for the hundredth time, Majesty, when\r\n      near the point of action, draws back; writes, after one has\r\n      waited, palpitating, an endless summer day, that “he has reason\r\n      to believe the Insurrection is not so ripe as you suppose.”\r\n      Whereat Bertrand-Moleville breaks forth “into extremity at one of\r\n      spleen and despair, _d’humeur et de désespoir_.”[496]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.VI.\r\n      The Steeples at Midnight.\r\n\r\n      For, in truth, the Insurrection is just about ripe. Thursday is\r\n      the ninth of the month August: if Forfeiture be not pronounced by\r\n      the Legislature that day, we must pronounce it ourselves.\r\n\r\n      Legislature? A poor waterlogged Legislature can pronounce\r\n      nothing. On Wednesday the eighth, after endless oratory once\r\n      again, they cannot even pronounce Accusation again Lafayette; but\r\n      absolve him,—hear it, Patriotism!—by a majority of two to one.\r\n      Patriotism hears it; Patriotism, hounded on by Prussian Terror,\r\n      by Preternatural Suspicion, roars tumultuous round the Salle de\r\n      Manége, all day; insults many leading Deputies, of the absolvent\r\n      Right-side; nay chases them, collars them with loud menace:\r\n      Deputy Vaublanc, and others of the like, are glad to take refuge\r\n      in Guardhouses, and escape by the back window. And so, next day,\r\n      there is infinite complaint; Letter after Letter from insulted\r\n      Deputy; mere complaint, debate and self-cancelling jargon: the\r\n      sun of Thursday sets like the others, and no Forfeiture\r\n      pronounced. Wherefore in fine, To your tents, O Israel!\r\n\r\n      The Mother-Society ceases speaking; groups cease haranguing:\r\n      Patriots, with closed lips now, “take one another’s arm;” walk\r\n      off, in rows, two and two, at a brisk business-pace; and vanish\r\n      afar in the obscure places of the East.[497] Santerre is ready;\r\n      or we will make him ready. Forty-seven of the Forty-eight\r\n      Sections are ready; nay Filles-Saint-Thomas itself turns up the\r\n      Jacobin side of it, turns down the Feuillant side of it, and is\r\n      ready too. Let the unlimited Patriot look to his weapon, be it\r\n      pike, be it firelock; and the Brest brethren, above all, the\r\n      blackbrowed Marseillese prepare themselves for the extreme hour!\r\n      Syndic Rœderer knows, and laments or not as the issue may turn,\r\n      that “five thousand ball-cartridges, within these few days, have\r\n      been distributed to Fédérés, at the Hôtel-de-Ville.”[498]\r\n\r\n      And ye likewise, gallant gentlemen, defenders of Royalty, crowd\r\n      ye on your side to the Tuileries. Not to a Levee: no, to a\r\n      Couchée: where much will be put to bed. Your Tickets of Entry are\r\n      needful; needfuller your blunderbusses!—They come and crowd, like\r\n      gallant men who also know how to die: old Maillé the Camp-Marshal\r\n      has come, his eyes gleaming once again, though dimmed by the\r\n      rheum of almost four-score years. Courage, Brothers! We have a\r\n      thousand red Swiss; men stanch of heart, steadfast as the granite\r\n      of their Alps. National Grenadiers are at least friends of Order;\r\n      Commandant Mandat breathes loyal ardour, will ‘answer for it on\r\n      his head.’ Mandat will, and his Staff; for the Staff, though\r\n      there stands a doom and Decree to that effect, is happily never\r\n      yet dissolved.\r\n\r\n      Commandant Mandat has corresponded with Mayor Pétion; carries a\r\n      written Order from him these three days, to repel force by force.\r\n      A squadron on the Pont Neuf with cannon shall turn back these\r\n      Marseillese coming across the River: a squadron at the Townhall\r\n      shall cut Saint-Antoine in two, “as it issues from the Arcade\r\n      Saint-Jean;” drive one half back to the obscure East, drive the\r\n      other half forward through “the Wickets of the Louvre.” Squadrons\r\n      not a few, and mounted squadrons; squadrons in the Palais Royal,\r\n      in the Place Vendôme: all these shall charge, at the right\r\n      moment; sweep this street, and then sweep that. Some new\r\n      Twentieth of June we shall have; only still more ineffectual? Or\r\n      probably the Insurrection will not dare to rise at all? Mandat’s\r\n      Squadrons, Horse-Gendarmerie and blue Guards march, clattering,\r\n      tramping; Mandat’s Cannoneers rumble. Under cloud of night; to\r\n      the sound of his _générale_, which begins drumming when men\r\n      should go to bed. It is the 9th night of August, 1792.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, the Forty-eight Sections correspond by swift\r\n      messengers; are choosing each their “three Delegates with full\r\n      powers.” Syndic Rœderer, Mayor Pétion are sent for to the\r\n      Tuileries: courageous Legislators, when the drum beats danger,\r\n      should repair to their Salle. Demoiselle Théroigne has on her\r\n      grenadier-bonnet, short-skirted riding-habit; two pistols garnish\r\n      her small waist, and sabre hangs in baldric by her side.\r\n\r\n      Such a game is playing in this Paris Pandemonium, or City of All\r\n      the Devils!—And yet the Night, as Mayor Pétion walks here in the\r\n      Tuileries Garden, “is beautiful and calm;” Orion and the Pleiades\r\n      glitter down quite serene. Pétion has come forth, the “heat”\r\n      inside was so oppressive.[499] Indeed, his Majesty’s reception of\r\n      him was of the roughest; as it well might be. And now there is no\r\n      outgate; Mandat’s blue Squadrons turn you back at every Grate;\r\n      nay the Filles-Saint-Thomas Grenadiers give themselves liberties\r\n      of tongue, How a virtuous Mayor “shall pay for it, if there be\r\n      mischief,” and the like; though others again are full of\r\n      civility. Surely if any man in France is in straights this night,\r\n      it is Mayor Pétion: bound, under pain of death, one may say, to\r\n      smile dexterously with the one side of his face, and weep with\r\n      the other;—death if he do it not dexterously enough! Not till\r\n      four in the morning does a National Assembly, hearing of his\r\n      plight, summon him over “to give account of Paris;” of which he\r\n      knows nothing: whereby however he shall get home to bed, and only\r\n      his gilt coach be left. Scarcely less delicate is Syndic\r\n      Rœderer’s task; who must wait whether he will lament or not, till\r\n      he see the issue. Janus Bifrons, or _Mr. Facing-both-ways_, as\r\n      vernacular Bunyan has it! They walk there, in the meanwhile,\r\n      these two Januses, with others of the like double conformation;\r\n      and “talk of indifferent matters.”\r\n\r\n      Rœderer, from time to time, steps in; to listen, to speak; to\r\n      send for the Department-Directory itself, he their Procureur\r\n      Syndic not seeing how to act. The Apartments are all crowded;\r\n      some seven hundred gentlemen in black elbowing, bustling; red\r\n      Swiss standing like rocks; ghost, or partial-ghost of a Ministry,\r\n      with Rœderer and advisers, hovering round their Majesties; old\r\n      Marshall Maillé kneeling at the King’s feet, to say, He and these\r\n      gallant gentlemen are come to die for him. List! through the\r\n      placid midnight; clang of the distant stormbell! So, in very\r\n      sooth; steeple after steeple takes up the wondrous tale. Black\r\n      Courtiers listen at the windows, opened for air; discriminate the\r\n      steeple-bells:[500] this is the tocsin of Saint-Roch; that again,\r\n      is it not Saint-Jacques, named _de la Boucherie?_ Yes, Messieurs!\r\n      Or even Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois, hear ye _it_ not? The same\r\n      metal that rang storm, two hundred and twenty years ago; but by a\r\n      Majesty’s order then; on Saint-Bartholomew’s Eve[501]—So go the\r\n      steeple-bells; which Courtiers can discriminate. Nay, meseems,\r\n      there is the Townhall itself; we know it by its sound! Yes,\r\n      Friends, that is the Townhall; discoursing _so_, to the Night.\r\n      Miraculously; by miraculous metal-tongue and man’s arm: Marat\r\n      himself, if you knew it, is pulling at the rope there! Marat is\r\n      pulling; Robespierre lies deep, invisible for the next forty\r\n      hours; and some men have heart, and some have as good as none,\r\n      and not even frenzy will give them any.\r\n\r\n      What struggling confusion, as the issue slowly draws on; and the\r\n      doubtful Hour, with pain and blind struggle, brings forth its\r\n      Certainty, never to be abolished!—The Full-power Delegates, three\r\n      from each Section, a Hundred and forty-four in all, got gathered\r\n      at the Townhall, about midnight. Mandat’s Squadron, stationed\r\n      there, did not hinder their entering: are they not the “Central\r\n      Committee of the Sections” who sit here usually; though in\r\n      greater number tonight? They are there: presided by Confusion,\r\n      Irresolution, and the Clack of Tongues. Swift scouts fly; Rumour\r\n      buzzes, of black Courtiers, red Swiss, of Mandat and his\r\n      Squadrons that shall charge. Better put off the Insurrection?\r\n      Yes, put it off. Ha, hark! Saint-Antoine booming out eloquent\r\n      tocsin, of its own accord!—Friends, no: ye cannot put off the\r\n      Insurrection; but must put it on, and live with it, or die with\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      Swift now, therefore: let these actual Old Municipals, on sight\r\n      of the Full-powers, and mandate of the Sovereign elective People,\r\n      lay down their functions; and this New Hundred and forty-four\r\n      take them up! Will ye nill ye, worthy Old Municipals, go ye must.\r\n      Nay is it not a happiness for many a Municipal that he can wash\r\n      his hands of such a business; and sit there paralyzed,\r\n      unaccountable, till the Hour do bring forth; or even go home to\r\n      his night’s rest?[502] Two only of the Old, or at most three, we\r\n      retain Mayor Pétion, for the present walking in the Tuileries;\r\n      Procureur Manuel; Procureur Substitute Danton, invisible Atlas of\r\n      the whole. And so, with our Hundred and forty-four, among whom\r\n      are a Tocsin-Huguenin, a Billaud, a Chaumette; and\r\n      Editor-Talliens, and Fabre d’Eglantines, Sergents, Panises; and\r\n      in brief, either emergent, or else emerged and full-blown, the\r\n      entire Flower of unlimited Patriotism: have we not, as by magic,\r\n      made a New Municipality; ready to act in the unlimited manner;\r\n      and declare itself roundly, “in a State of Insurrection!”—First\r\n      of all, then, be Commandant Mandat sent for, with that\r\n      Mayor’s-Order of his; also let the New Municipals visit those\r\n      Squadrons that were to charge; and let the stormbell ring its\r\n      loudest;—and, on the whole, Forward, ye Hundred and forty-four;\r\n      retreat is now none for you!\r\n\r\n      Reader, fancy not, in thy languid way, that Insurrection is easy.\r\n      Insurrection is difficult: each individual uncertain even of his\r\n      next neighbour; totally uncertain of his distant neighbours, what\r\n      strength is with him, what strength is against him; certain only\r\n      that, in case of failure, his individual portion is the gallows!\r\n      Eight hundred thousand heads, and in each of them a separate\r\n      estimate of these uncertainties, a separate theorem of action\r\n      conformable to that: out of so many uncertainties, does the\r\n      certainty, and inevitable net-result never to be abolished, go\r\n      on, at all moments, bodying itself forth;—leading thee also\r\n      towards civic-crowns or an ignominious noose.\r\n\r\n      Could the Reader take an Asmodeus’s Flight, and waving open all\r\n      roofs and privacies, look down from the Tower of Notre Dame, what\r\n      a Paris were it! Of treble-voice whimperings or vehemence, of\r\n      bass-voice growlings, dubitations; Courage screwing itself to\r\n      desperate defiance; Cowardice trembling silent within barred\r\n      doors;—and all round, Dulness calmly snoring; for much Dulness,\r\n      flung on its mattresses, always sleeps. O, between the clangour\r\n      of these high-storming tocsins and that snore of Dulness, what a\r\n      gamut: of trepidation, excitation, desperation; and above it mere\r\n      Doubt, Danger, Atropos and Nox!\r\n\r\n      Fighters of this section draw out; hear that the next Section\r\n      does not; and thereupon draw in. Saint-Antoine, on this side the\r\n      River, is uncertain of Saint-Marceau on that. Steady only is the\r\n      snore of Dulness, are the Six Hundred Marseillese that know how\r\n      to die! Mandat, twice summoned to the Townhall, has not come.\r\n      Scouts fly incessant, in distracted haste; and the\r\n      many-whispering voices of Rumour. Théroigne and unofficial\r\n      Patriots flit, dim-visible, exploratory, far and wide; like\r\n      Night-birds on the wing. Of Nationals some Three thousand have\r\n      followed Mandat and his _générale;_ the rest follow each his own\r\n      theorem of the uncertainties: theorem, that one should march\r\n      rather with Saint-Antoine; innumerable theorems, that in such a\r\n      case the wholesomest were _sleep_. And so the drums beat, in made\r\n      fits, and the stormbells peal. Saint-Antoine itself does but draw\r\n      out and draw in; Commandant Santerre, over there, cannot believe\r\n      that the Marseillese and Saint Marceau will march. Thou laggard\r\n      sonorous Beer-vat, with the loud voice and timber head, is it\r\n      time now to palter? Alsatian Westermann clutches him by the\r\n      throat with drawn sabre: whereupon the Timber-headed believes. In\r\n      this manner wanes the slow night; amid fret, uncertainty and\r\n      tocsin; all men’s humour rising to the hysterical pitch; and\r\n      nothing done.\r\n\r\n      However, Mandat, on the third summons does come;—come, unguarded;\r\n      astonished to find the Municipality _new_. They question him\r\n      straitly on that Mayor’s-Order to resist force by force; on that\r\n      strategic scheme of cutting Saint-Antoine in two halves: he\r\n      answers what he can: they think it were right to send this\r\n      strategic National Commandant to the Abbaye Prison, and let a\r\n      Court of Law decide on him. Alas, a Court of Law, not Book-Law\r\n      but primeval Club-Law, crowds and jostles out of doors; all\r\n      fretted to the hysterical pitch; cruel as Fear, blind as the\r\n      Night: such Court of Law, and no other, clutches poor Mandat from\r\n      his constables; beats him down, massacres him, on the steps of\r\n      the Townhall. Look to it, ye new Municipals; ye People, in a\r\n      state of Insurrection! Blood is shed, blood must be answered\r\n      for;—alas, in such hysterical humour, more blood will flow: for\r\n      it is as with the Tiger in that; he has only to begin.\r\n\r\n      Seventeen Individuals have been seized in the Champs Elysées, by\r\n      exploratory Patriotism; they flitting dim-visible, by it flitting\r\n      dim-visible. Ye have pistols, rapiers, ye Seventeen? One of those\r\n      accursed “false Patrols;” that go marauding, with Anti-National\r\n      intent; seeking what they can spy, what they can spill! The\r\n      Seventeen are carried to the nearest Guard-house; eleven of them\r\n      escape by back passages. ‘How is this?’ Demoiselle Théroigne\r\n      appears at the front entrance, with sabre, pistols, and a train;\r\n      denounces treasonous connivance; demands, seizes, the remaining\r\n      six, that the justice of the People be not trifled with. Of which\r\n      six two more escape in the whirl and debate of the Club-Law\r\n      Court; the last unhappy Four are massacred, as Mandat was: Two\r\n      Ex-Bodyguards; one dissipated Abbé; one Royalist Pamphleteer,\r\n      Sulleau, known to us by name, Able Editor, and wit of all work.\r\n      Poor Sulleau: his _Acts of the Apostles_, and brisk\r\n      Placard-Journals (for he was an able man) come to _Finis_, in\r\n      this manner; and questionable jesting issues suddenly in horrid\r\n      earnest! Such doings usher in the dawn of the Tenth of August,\r\n      1792.\r\n\r\n      Or think what a night the poor National Assembly has had: sitting\r\n      there, “in great paucity,” attempting to debate;—quivering and\r\n      shivering; pointing towards all the thirty-two azimuths at once,\r\n      as the magnet-needle does when thunderstorm is in the air! If the\r\n      Insurrection come? If it come, and fail? Alas, in that case, may\r\n      not black Courtiers, with blunderbusses, red Swiss with bayonets\r\n      rush over, flushed with victory, and ask us: Thou undefinable,\r\n      waterlogged, self-distractive, self-destructive Legislative, what\r\n      dost thou here _unsunk?_—Or figure the poor National Guards,\r\n      bivouacking “in temporary tents” there; or standing ranked,\r\n      shifting from leg to leg, all through the weary night; New\r\n      tricolor Municipals ordering one thing, old Mandat Captains\r\n      ordering another! Procureur Manuel has ordered the cannons to be\r\n      withdrawn from the Pont Neuf; none ventured to disobey him. It\r\n      seemed certain, then, the old Staff so long doomed has finally\r\n      been dissolved, in these hours; and Mandat is not our Commandant\r\n      now, but Santerre? Yes, friends: Santerre henceforth,—surely\r\n      Mandat no more! The Squadrons that were to charge see nothing\r\n      certain, except that they are cold, hungry, worn down with\r\n      watching; that it were sad to slay French brothers; sadder to be\r\n      slain by them. Without the Tuileries Circuit, and within it, sour\r\n      uncertain humour sways these men: only the red Swiss stand\r\n      steadfast. Them their officers refresh now with a slight wetting\r\n      of brandy; wherein the Nationals, too far gone for brandy, refuse\r\n      to participate.\r\n\r\n      King Louis meanwhile had laid him down for a little sleep: his\r\n      wig when he reappeared had lost the powder on one side.[503] Old\r\n      Marshal Maillé and the gentlemen in black rise always in spirits,\r\n      as the Insurrection does not rise: there goes a witty saying now,\r\n      ‘_Le tocsin ne rend pas_.’ The tocsin, like a dry milk-cow, does\r\n      not yield. For the rest, could one not proclaim Martial Law? Not\r\n      easily; for now, it seems, Mayor Pétion is gone. On the other\r\n      hand, our Interim Commandant, poor Mandat being off, “to the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville,” complains that so many Courtiers in black\r\n      encumber the service, are an eyesorrow to the National Guards. To\r\n      which her Majesty answers with emphasis, That they will obey all,\r\n      will suffer all, that they are sure men these.\r\n\r\n      And so the yellow lamplight dies out in the gray of morning, in\r\n      the King’s Palace, over such a scene. Scene of jostling,\r\n      elbowing, of confusion, and indeed conclusion, for the thing is\r\n      about to end. Rœderer and spectral Ministers jostle in the press;\r\n      consult, in side cabinets, with one or with both Majesties.\r\n      Sister Elizabeth takes the Queen to the window: ‘Sister, see what\r\n      a beautiful sunrise,’ right over the Jacobins church and that\r\n      quarter! How happy if the tocsin did not yield! But Mandat\r\n      returns not; Pétion is gone: much hangs wavering in the invisible\r\n      Balance. About five o’clock, there rises from the Garden a kind\r\n      of sound; as of a shout to which had become a howl, and instead\r\n      of _Vive le Roi_ were ending in _Vive la Nation_. ‘_Mon Dieu!_’\r\n      ejaculates a spectral Minister, ‘what is he doing down there?’\r\n      For it is his Majesty, gone down with old Marshal Maillé to\r\n      review the troops; and the nearest companies of them answer _so_.\r\n      Her Majesty bursts into a stream of tears. Yet on stepping from\r\n      the cabinet her eyes are dry and calm, her look is even cheerful.\r\n      “The Austrian lip, and the aquiline nose, fuller than usual, gave\r\n      to her countenance,” says Peltier,[504] “something of Majesty,\r\n      which they that did not see her in these moments cannot well have\r\n      an idea of.” O thou Theresa’s Daughter!\r\n\r\n      King Louis enters, much blown with the fatigue; but for the rest\r\n      with his old air of indifference. Of all hopes now surely the\r\n      joyfullest were, that the tocsin did not yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.VII.\r\n      The Swiss.\r\n\r\n      Unhappy Friends, the tocsin does yield, has yielded! Lo ye, how\r\n      with the first sun-rays its Ocean-tide, of pikes and fusils,\r\n      flows glittering from the far East;—immeasurable; born of the\r\n      Night! They march there, the grim host; Saint-Antoine on this\r\n      side of the River; Saint-Marceau on that, the blackbrowed\r\n      Marseillese in the van. With hum, and grim murmur, far-heard;\r\n      like the Ocean-tide, as we say: drawn up, as if by Luna and\r\n      Influences, from the great Deep of Waters, they roll gleaming on;\r\n      no King, Canute or Louis, can bid them roll back. Wide-eddying\r\n      side-currents, of onlookers, roll hither and thither, unarmed,\r\n      not voiceless; they, the steel host, roll on. New-Commandant\r\n      Santerre, indeed, has taken seat at the Townhall; rests there, in\r\n      his half-way-house. Alsatian Westermann, with flashing sabre,\r\n      does not rest; nor the Sections, nor the Marseillese, nor\r\n      Demoiselle Théroigne; but roll continually on.\r\n\r\n      And now, where are Mandat’s Squadrons that were to charge? Not a\r\n      Squadron of them stirs: or they stir in the wrong direction, out\r\n      of the way; their officers glad that they will even do that. It\r\n      is to this hour uncertain whether the Squadron on the Pont Neuf\r\n      made the shadow of resistance, or did not make the shadow:\r\n      enough, the blackbrowed Marseillese, and Saint-Marceau following\r\n      them, do cross without let; do cross, in sure hope now of\r\n      Saint-Antoine and the rest; do billow on, towards the Tuileries,\r\n      where their errand is. The Tuileries, at sound of them, rustles\r\n      responsive: the red Swiss look to their priming; Courtiers in\r\n      black draw their blunderbusses, rapiers, poniards, some have even\r\n      fire-shovels; every man his weapon of war.\r\n\r\n      Judge if, in these circumstances, Syndic Rœderer felt easy! Will\r\n      the kind Heavens open no middle-course of refuge for a poor\r\n      Syndic who halts between two? If indeed his Majesty would consent\r\n      to go over to the Assembly! His Majesty, above all her Majesty,\r\n      cannot agree to that. Did her Majesty answer the proposal with a\r\n      ‘_Fi donc;_’ did she say even, she would be nailed to the walls\r\n      sooner? Apparently not. It is written also that she offered the\r\n      King a pistol; saying, Now or else never was the time to shew\r\n      himself. Close eye-witnesses did not see it, nor do we. That saw\r\n      only that she was queenlike, quiet; that she argued not,\r\n      upbraided not, with the Inexorable; but, like Cæsar in the\r\n      Capitol, wrapped her mantle, as it beseems Queens and Sons of\r\n      Adam to do. But thou, O Louis! of what stuff art thou at all? Is\r\n      there no stroke in thee, then, for Life and Crown? The silliest\r\n      hunted deer dies not so. Art thou the languidest of all mortals;\r\n      or the mildest-minded? Thou art the worst-starred.\r\n\r\n      The tide advances; Syndic Rœderer’s and all men’s straits grow\r\n      straiter and straiter. Fremescent clangor comes from the armed\r\n      Nationals in the Court; far and wide is the infinite hubbub of\r\n      tongues. What counsel? And the tide is now nigh! Messengers,\r\n      forerunners speak hastily through the outer Grates; hold parley\r\n      sitting astride the walls. Syndic Rœderer goes out and comes in.\r\n      Cannoneers ask him: Are we to fire against the people? King’s\r\n      Ministers ask him: Shall the King’s House be forced? Syndic\r\n      Rœderer has a hard game to play. He speaks to the Cannoneers with\r\n      eloquence, with fervour; such fervour as a man can, who has to\r\n      blow hot and cold in one breath. Hot and cold, O Rœderer? We, for\r\n      our part, cannot live _and_ die! The Cannoneers, by way of\r\n      answer, fling down their linstocks.—Think of this answer, O King\r\n      Louis, and King’s Ministers: and take a poor Syndic’s safe\r\n      middle-course, towards the Salle de Manége. King Louis sits, his\r\n      hands leant on knees, body bent forward; gazes for a space\r\n      fixedly on Syndic Rœderer; then answers, looking over his\r\n      shoulder to the Queen: _Marchons!_ They march; King Louis, Queen,\r\n      Sister Elizabeth, the two royal children and governess: these,\r\n      with Syndic Rœderer, and Officials of the Department; amid a\r\n      double rank of National Guards. The men with blunderbusses, the\r\n      steady red Swiss gaze mournfully, reproachfully; but hear only\r\n      these words from Syndic Rœderer: ‘The King is going to the\r\n      Assembly; make way.’ It has struck eight, on all clocks, some\r\n      minutes ago: the King has left the Tuileries—for ever.\r\n\r\n      O ye stanch Swiss, ye gallant gentlemen in black, for what a\r\n      cause are ye to spend and be spent! Look out from the western\r\n      windows, ye may see King Louis placidly hold on his way; the poor\r\n      little Prince Royal “sportfully kicking the fallen leaves.”\r\n      Fremescent multitude on the Terrace of the Feuillants whirls\r\n      parallel to him; one man in it, very noisy, with a long pole:\r\n      will they not obstruct the outer Staircase, and back-entrance of\r\n      the Salle, when it comes to that? King’s Guards can go no further\r\n      than the bottom step there. Lo, Deputation of Legislators come\r\n      out; he of the long pole is stilled by oratory; Assembly’s Guards\r\n      join themselves to King’s Guards, and all may mount in this case\r\n      of necessity; the outer Staircase is free, or passable. See,\r\n      Royalty ascends; a blue Grenadier lifts the poor little Prince\r\n      Royal from the press; Royalty has entered in. Royalty has\r\n      vanished for ever from your eyes.—And ye? Left standing there,\r\n      amid the yawning abysses, and earthquake of Insurrection; without\r\n      course; without command: if ye perish it must be as more than\r\n      martyrs, as martyrs who are now without a cause! The black\r\n      Courtiers disappear mostly; through such issues as they can. The\r\n      poor Swiss know not how to act: one duty only is clear to them,\r\n      that of standing by their post; and they will perform that.\r\n\r\n      But the glittering steel tide has arrived; it beats now against\r\n      the Château barriers, and eastern Courts; irresistible,\r\n      loud-surging far and wide;—breaks in, fills the Court of the\r\n      Carrousel, blackbrowed Marseillese in the van. King Louis gone,\r\n      say you; over to the Assembly! Well and good: but till the\r\n      Assembly pronounce Forfeiture of him, what boots it? Our post is\r\n      in that Château or stronghold of his; there till then must we\r\n      continue. Think, ye stanch Swiss, whether it were good that grim\r\n      murder began, and brothers blasted one another in pieces for a\r\n      stone edifice?—Poor Swiss! they know not how to act: from the\r\n      southern windows, some fling cartridges, in sign of brotherhood;\r\n      on the eastern outer staircase, and within through long stairs\r\n      and corridors, they stand firm-ranked, peaceable and yet refusing\r\n      to stir. Westermann speaks to them in Alsatian German;\r\n      Marseillese plead, in hot Provençal speech and pantomime;\r\n      stunning hubbub pleads and threatens, infinite, around. The Swiss\r\n      stand fast, peaceable and yet immovable; red granite pier in that\r\n      waste-flashing sea of steel.\r\n\r\n      Who can help the inevitable issue; Marseillese and all France, on\r\n      this side; granite Swiss on that? The pantomime grows hotter and\r\n      hotter; Marseillese sabres flourishing by way of action; the\r\n      Swiss brow also clouding itself, the Swiss thumb bringing its\r\n      firelock to the cock. And hark! high-thundering above all the\r\n      din, three Marseillese cannon from the Carrousel, pointed by a\r\n      gunner of bad aim, come rattling over the roofs! Ye Swiss,\r\n      therefore: _Fire!_ The Swiss fire; by volley, by platoon, in\r\n      rolling-fire: Marseillese men not a few, and “a tall man that was\r\n      louder than any,” lie silent, smashed, upon the pavement;—not a\r\n      few Marseillese, after the long dusty march, have made halt\r\n      _here_. The Carrousel is void; the black tide recoiling;\r\n      “fugitives rushing as far as Saint-Antoine before they stop.” The\r\n      Cannoneers without linstock have squatted invisible, and left\r\n      their cannon; which the Swiss seize.\r\n\r\n      Think what a volley: reverberating doomful to the four corners of\r\n      Paris, and through all hearts; like the clang of Bellona’s\r\n      thongs! The blackbrowed Marseillese, rallying on the instant,\r\n      have become black Demons that know how to die. Nor is Brest\r\n      behind-hand; nor Alsatian Westermann; Demoiselle Théroigne is\r\n      Sybil Théroigne: Vengeance _Victoire, ou la mort!_ From all\r\n      Patriot artillery, great and small; from Feuillants Terrace, and\r\n      all terraces and places of the widespread Insurrectionary sea,\r\n      there roars responsive a red whirlwind. Blue Nationals, ranked in\r\n      the Garden, cannot help their muskets going off, _against_\r\n      Foreign murderers. For there is a sympathy in muskets, in heaped\r\n      masses of men: nay, are not Mankind, in whole, like tuned\r\n      strings, and a cunning infinite concordance and unity; you smite\r\n      one string, and all strings will begin sounding,—in soft\r\n      sphere-melody, in deafening screech of madness! Mounted\r\n      Gendarmerie gallop distracted; are fired on merely as a thing\r\n      running; galloping over the Pont Royal, or one knows not whither.\r\n      The brain of Paris, brain-fevered in the centre of it here, has\r\n      gone mad; what you call, taken fire.\r\n\r\n      Behold, the fire slackens not; nor does the Swiss rolling-fire\r\n      slacken from within. Nay they clutched cannon, as we saw: and\r\n      now, from the other side, they clutch three pieces more; alas,\r\n      cannon without linstock; nor will the steel-and-flint answer,\r\n      though they try it.[505] Had it chanced to answer! Patriot\r\n      onlookers have their misgivings; one strangest Patriot onlooker\r\n      thinks that the Swiss, had they a commander, would beat. He is a\r\n      man not unqualified to judge; the name of him is Napoleon\r\n      Buonaparte.[506] And onlookers, and women, stand gazing, and the\r\n      witty Dr. Moore of Glasgow among them, on the other side of the\r\n      River: cannon rush rumbling past them; pause on the Pont Royal;\r\n      belch out their iron entrails there, against the Tuileries; and\r\n      at every new belch, the women and onlookers shout and clap\r\n      hands.[507] City of all the Devils! In remote streets, men are\r\n      drinking breakfast-coffee; following their affairs; with a start\r\n      now and then, as some dull echo reverberates a note louder. And\r\n      here? Marseillese fall wounded; but Barbaroux has surgeons;\r\n      Barbaroux is close by, managing, though underhand, and under\r\n      cover. Marseillese fall death-struck; bequeath their firelock,\r\n      specify in which pocket are the cartridges; and die, murmuring,\r\n      ‘Revenge me, Revenge thy country!’ Brest Fédéré Officers,\r\n      galloping in red coats, are shot as Swiss. Lo you, the Carrousel\r\n      has burst into flame!—Paris Pandemonium! Nay the poor City, as we\r\n      said, is in fever-fit and convulsion; such crisis has lasted for\r\n      the space of some half hour.\r\n\r\n      But what is this that, with Legislative Insignia, ventures\r\n      through the hubbub and death-hail, from the back-entrance of the\r\n      Manege? Towards the Tuileries and Swiss: written Order from his\r\n      Majesty to cease firing! O ye hapless Swiss, why was there no\r\n      order not to begin it? Gladly would the Swiss cease firing: but\r\n      who will bid mad Insurrection cease firing? To Insurrection you\r\n      cannot speak; neither can it, hydra-headed, hear. The dead and\r\n      dying, by the hundred, lie all around; are borne bleeding through\r\n      the streets, towards help; the sight of them, like a torch of the\r\n      Furies, kindling Madness. Patriot Paris roars; as the bear\r\n      bereaved of her whelps. On, ye Patriots: vengeance! victory or\r\n      death! There are men seen, who rush on, armed only with\r\n      walking-sticks.[508] Terror and Fury rule the hour.\r\n\r\n      The Swiss, pressed on from without, paralyzed from within, have\r\n      ceased to shoot; but not to be shot. What shall they do?\r\n      Desperate is the moment. Shelter or instant death: yet How?\r\n      Where? One party flies out by the Rue de l’Echelle; is destroyed\r\n      utterly, “_en entier_.” A second, by the other side, throws\r\n      itself into the Garden; “hurrying across a keen fusillade:”\r\n      rushes suppliant into the National Assembly; finds pity and\r\n      refuge in the back benches there. The third, and largest, darts\r\n      out in column, three hundred strong, towards the Champs Elysées:\r\n      Ah, could we but reach Courbevoye, where other Swiss are! Wo!\r\n      see, in such fusillade the column “soon breaks itself by\r\n      diversity of opinion,” into distracted segments, this way and\r\n      that;—to escape in holes, to die fighting from street to street.\r\n      The firing and murdering will not cease; not yet for long. The\r\n      red Porters of Hotels are shot at, be they _Suisse_ by nature, or\r\n      _Suisse_ only in name. The very Firemen, who pump and labour on\r\n      that smoking Carrousel, are shot at; why should the Carrousel\r\n      _not_ burn? Some Swiss take refuge in private houses; find that\r\n      mercy too does still dwell in the heart of man. The brave\r\n      Marseillese are merciful, late so wroth; and labour to save.\r\n      Journalist Gorsas pleads hard with enfuriated groups. Clemence,\r\n      the Wine-merchant, stumbles forward to the Bar of the Assembly, a\r\n      rescued Swiss in his hand; tells passionately how he rescued him\r\n      with pain and peril, how he will henceforth support him, being\r\n      childless himself; and falls a swoon round the poor Swiss’s neck:\r\n      amid plaudits. But the most are butchered, and even mangled.\r\n      Fifty (some say Fourscore) were marched as prisoners, by National\r\n      Guards, to the Hôtel-de-Ville: the ferocious people bursts\r\n      through on them, in the Place de Grève; massacres them to the\r\n      last man. “_O Peuple_, envy of the universe!” _Peuple_, in mad\r\n      Gaelic effervescence!\r\n\r\n      Surely few things in the history of carnage are painfuller. What\r\n      ineffaceable red streak, flickering so sad in the memory, is\r\n      that, of this poor column of red Swiss “breaking itself in the\r\n      confusion of opinions;” dispersing, into blackness and death!\r\n      Honour to you, brave men; honourable pity, through long times!\r\n      Not martyrs were ye; and yet almost more. He was no King of\r\n      yours, this Louis; and he forsook you like a King of shreds and\r\n      patches; ye were but sold to him for some poor sixpence a-day;\r\n      yet would ye work for your wages, keep your plighted word. The\r\n      work now was to die; and ye did it. Honour to you, O Kinsmen; and\r\n      may the old Deutsch _Biederkeit_ and _Tapferkeit_, and Valour\r\n      which is _Worth_ and _Truth_ be they Swiss, be they Saxon, fail\r\n      in no age! Not bastards; true-born were these men; sons of the\r\n      men of Sempach, of Murten, who knelt, but not to thee, O\r\n      Burgundy!—Let the traveller, as he passes through Lucerne, turn\r\n      aside to look a little at their monumental Lion; not for\r\n      Thorwaldsen’s sake alone. Hewn out of living rock, the Figure\r\n      rests there, by the still Lake-waters, in lullaby of\r\n      distant-tinkling _rance-des-vaches_, the granite Mountains dumbly\r\n      keeping watch all round; and, though inanimate, speaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 2.6.VIII.\r\n      Constitution burst in Pieces.\r\n\r\n      Thus is the Tenth of August won and lost. Patriotism reckons its\r\n      slain by thousand on thousand, so deadly was the Swiss fire from\r\n      these windows; but will finally reduce them to some Twelve\r\n      hundred. No child’s play was it;—nor is it! Till two in the\r\n      afternoon the massacring, the breaking and the burning has not\r\n      ended; nor the loose Bedlam shut itself again.\r\n\r\n      How deluges of frantic Sansculottism roared through all passages\r\n      of this Tuileries, ruthless in vengeance, how the Valets were\r\n      butchered, hewn down; and Dame Campan saw the Marseilles sabre\r\n      flash over her head, but the Blackbrowed said, ‘_Va-t-en_, Get\r\n      thee gone,’ and flung her from him unstruck:[509] how in the\r\n      cellars wine-bottles were broken, wine-butts were staved in and\r\n      drunk; and, upwards to the very garrets, all windows tumbled out\r\n      their precious royal furnitures; and, with gold mirrors, velvet\r\n      curtains, down of ript feather-beds, and dead bodies of men, the\r\n      Tuileries was like no Garden of the Earth:—all this let him who\r\n      has a taste for it see amply in Mercier, in acrid Montgaillard,\r\n      or Beaulieu of the _Deux Amis_. A hundred and eighty bodies of\r\n      Swiss lie piled there; naked, unremoved till the second day.\r\n      Patriotism has torn their red coats into snips; and marches with\r\n      them at the Pike’s point: the ghastly bare corpses lie there,\r\n      under the sun and under the stars; the curious of both sexes\r\n      crowding to look. Which let not us do. Above a hundred carts\r\n      heaped with Dead fare towards the Cemetery of Sainte-Madeleine;\r\n      bewailed, bewept; for all had kindred, all had mothers, if not\r\n      here, then there. It is one of those Carnage-fields, such as you\r\n      read of by the name “Glorious Victory,” brought home in this case\r\n      to one’s own door.\r\n\r\n      But the blackbrowed Marseillese have struck down the Tyrant of\r\n      the Château. He is struck down; low, and hardly to rise. What a\r\n      moment for an august Legislative was that when the Hereditary\r\n      Representative entered, under such circumstances; and the\r\n      Grenadier, carrying the little Prince Royal out of the Press, set\r\n      him down on the Assembly-table! A moment,—which one had to smooth\r\n      off with oratory; waiting what the next would bring! Louis said\r\n      few words: ‘He was come hither to prevent a great crime; he\r\n      believed himself safer nowhere than here.’ President Vergniaud\r\n      answered briefly, in vague oratory as we say, about ‘defence of\r\n      Constituted Authorities,’ about dying at our post.[510] And so\r\n      King Louis sat him down; first here, then there; for a difficulty\r\n      arose, the Constitution not permitting us to debate while the\r\n      King is present: finally he settles himself with his Family in\r\n      the “_Loge_ of the _Logographe_” in the Reporter’s-Box of a\r\n      Journalist: which is beyond the enchanted Constitutional Circuit,\r\n      separated from it by a rail. To such Lodge of the _Logographe_,\r\n      measuring some ten feet square, with a small closet at the\r\n      entrance of it behind, is the King of broad France now limited:\r\n      here can he and his sit pent, under the eyes of the world, or\r\n      retire into their closet at intervals; for the space of sixteen\r\n      hours. Such quiet peculiar moment has the Legislative lived to\r\n      see.\r\n\r\n      But also what a moment was that other, few minutes later, when\r\n      the three Marseillese cannon went off, and the Swiss rolling-fire\r\n      and universal thunder, like the Crack of Doom, began to rattle!\r\n      Honourable Members start to their feet; stray bullets singing\r\n      epicedium even here, shivering in with window-glass and jingle.\r\n      ‘No, this is our post; let us die here!’ They sit therefore, like\r\n      stone Legislators. But may not the Lodge of the _Logographe_ be\r\n      forced from behind? Tear down the railing that divides it from\r\n      the enchanted Constitutional Circuit! Ushers tear and tug; his\r\n      Majesty himself aiding from within: the railing gives way;\r\n      Majesty and Legislative are united in place, unknown Destiny\r\n      hovering over both.\r\n\r\n      Rattle, and again rattle, went the thunder; one breathless\r\n      wide-eyed messenger rushing in after another: King’s orders to\r\n      the Swiss went out. It was a fearful thunder; but, as we know, it\r\n      ended. Breathless messengers, fugitive Swiss, denunciatory\r\n      Patriots, trepidation; finally tripudiation!—Before four o’clock\r\n      much has come and gone.\r\n\r\n      The New Municipals have come and gone; with Three Flags,\r\n      _Liberté, Egalité, Patrie_, and the clang of vivats. Vergniaud,\r\n      he who as President few hours ago talked of Dying for Constituted\r\n      Authorities, has moved, as Committee-Reporter, that the\r\n      Hereditary Representative _be suspended;_ that a NATIONAL\r\n      CONVENTION do forthwith assemble to say what further! An able\r\n      Report: which the President must have had ready in his pocket? A\r\n      President, in such cases, must have much ready, and yet not\r\n      ready; and Janus-like look before and after.\r\n\r\n      King Louis listens to all; retires about midnight “to three\r\n      little rooms on the upper floor;” till the Luxembourg be prepared\r\n      for him, and “the safeguard of the Nation.” Safer if Brunswick\r\n      were once here! Or, alas, not so safe? Ye hapless discrowned\r\n      heads! Crowds came, next morning, to catch a climpse of them, in\r\n      their three upper rooms. Montgaillard says the august Captives\r\n      wore an air of cheerfulness, even of gaiety; that the Queen and\r\n      Princess Lamballe, who had joined her over night, looked out of\r\n      the open window, “shook powder from their hair on the people\r\n      below, and laughed.”[511] He is an acrid distorted man.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, one may guess that the Legislative, above all that\r\n      the New Municipality continues busy. Messengers, Municipal or\r\n      Legislative, and swift despatches rush off to all corners of\r\n      France; full of triumph, blended with indignant wail, for Twelve\r\n      hundred have fallen. France sends up its blended shout\r\n      responsive; the Tenth of August shall be as the Fourteenth of\r\n      July, only bloodier and greater. The Court has conspired? Poor\r\n      Court: the Court has been vanquished; and will have both the\r\n      scath to bear and the scorn. How the Statues of Kings do now all\r\n      fall! Bronze Henri himself, though he wore a cockade once,\r\n      jingles down from the Pont Neuf, where _Patrie_ floats _in\r\n      Danger_. Much more does Louis Fourteenth, from the Place Vendôme,\r\n      jingle down, and even breaks in falling. The curious can remark,\r\n      written on his horse’s shoe: “12 _Août_ 1692;” a Century and a\r\n      Day.\r\n\r\n      The Tenth of August was Friday. The week is not done, when our\r\n      old Patriot Ministry is recalled, what of it can be got: strict\r\n      Roland, Genevese Clavière; add heavy Monge the Mathematician,\r\n      once a stone-hewer; and, for Minister of Justice,—Danton “led\r\n      hither,” as himself says, in one of his gigantic figures,\r\n      “through the breach of Patriot cannon!” These, under Legislative\r\n      Committees, must rule the wreck as they can: confusedly enough;\r\n      with an old Legislative waterlogged, with a New Municipality so\r\n      brisk. But National Convention will get itself together; and\r\n      _then!_ Without delay, however, let a New Jury-Court and Criminal\r\n      Tribunal be set up in Paris, to try the crimes and conspiracies\r\n      of the Tenth. High Court of Orléans is distant, slow: the blood\r\n      of the Twelve hundred Patriots, whatever become of other blood,\r\n      shall be inquired after. Tremble, ye Criminals and Conspirators;\r\n      the Minister of Justice is Danton! Robespierre too, after the\r\n      victory, sits in the New Municipality; insurrectionary\r\n      “improvised Municipality,” which calls itself Council General of\r\n      the Commune.\r\n\r\n      For three days now, Louis and his Family have heard the\r\n      Legislative Debates in the Lodge of the _Logographe;_ and retired\r\n      nightly to their small upper rooms. The Luxembourg and safeguard\r\n      of the Nation could not be got ready: nay, it seems the\r\n      Luxembourg has too many cellars and issues; no Municipality can\r\n      undertake to watch it. The compact Prison of the Temple, not so\r\n      elegant indeed, were much safer. To the Temple, therefore! On\r\n      Monday, 13th day of August 1792, in Mayor Pétion’s carriage,\r\n      Louis and his sad suspended Household, fare thither; all Paris\r\n      out to look at them. As they pass through the Place Vendôme Louis\r\n      Fourteenth’s Statue lies broken on the ground. Pétion is afraid\r\n      the Queen’s looks may be thought scornful, and produce\r\n      provocation; she casts down her eyes, and does not look at all.\r\n      The “press is prodigious,” but quiet: here and there, it shouts\r\n      _Vive la Nation;_ but for most part gazes in silence. French\r\n      Royalty vanishes within the gates of the Temple: these old peaked\r\n      Towers, like peaked Extinguisher or _Bonsoir_, do cover it\r\n      up;—from which same Towers, poor Jacques Molay and his Templars\r\n      were burnt out, by French Royalty, five centuries since. Such are\r\n      the turns of Fate below. Foreign Ambassadors, English Lord Gower\r\n      have all demanded passports; are driving indignantly towards\r\n      their respective homes.\r\n\r\n      So, then, the Constitution is over? For ever and a day! Gone is\r\n      that wonder of the Universe; First biennial Parliament,\r\n      waterlogged, waits only till the Convention come; and will then\r\n      sink to endless depths.\r\n\r\n      One can guess the silent rage of Old-Constituents,\r\n      Constitution-builders, extinct Feuillants, men who thought the\r\n      Constitution would march! Lafayette rises to the altitude of the\r\n      situation; at the head of his Army. Legislative Commissioners are\r\n      posting towards him and it, on the Northern Frontier, to\r\n      congratulate and perorate: he orders the Municipality of Sedan to\r\n      arrest these Commissioners, and keep them strictly in ward as\r\n      Rebels, till he say further. The Sedan Municipals obey.\r\n\r\n      The Sedan Municipals obey: but the Soldiers of the Lafayette\r\n      Army? The Soldiers of the Lafayette Army have, as all Soldiers\r\n      have, a kind of dim feeling that they themselves are Sansculottes\r\n      in buff belts; that the victory of the Tenth of August is also a\r\n      victory for them. They will not rise and follow Lafayette to\r\n      Paris; they will rise and _send_ him thither! On the 18th, which\r\n      is but next Saturday, Lafayette, with some two or three indignant\r\n      Staff-officers, one of whom is Old-Constituent Alexandre de\r\n      Lameth, having first put his Lines in what order he could,—rides\r\n      swiftly over the Marches, towards Holland. Rides, alas, swiftly\r\n      into the claws of Austrians! He, long-wavering, trembling on the\r\n      verge of the horizon, has set, in Olmutz Dungeons; this History\r\n      knows him no more. Adieu, thou Hero of two worlds; thinnest, but\r\n      compact honour-worthy man! Through long rough night of captivity,\r\n      through other tumults, triumphs and changes, thou wilt swing\r\n      well, “fast-anchored to the Washington Formula;” and be the Hero\r\n      and Perfect-character, were it only of one idea. The Sedan\r\n      Municipals repent and protest; the Soldiers shout _Vive la\r\n      Nation_.

The dead cerements are\r\n      rent into cobwebs, and she fronts you in that terrible strength\r\n      of Nature, which no man has measured, which goes down to Madness\r\n      and Tophet: see now how ye will deal with her!\r\n\r\n      This month of September, 1792, which has become one of the\r\n      memorable months of History, presents itself under two most\r\n      diverse aspects; all of black on the one side, all of bright on\r\n      the other. Whatsoever is cruel in the panic frenzy of Twenty-five\r\n      million men, whatsoever is great in the simultaneous\r\n      death-defiance of Twenty-five million men, stand here in abrupt\r\n      contrast, near by one another. As indeed is usual when a man, how\r\n      much more when a Nation of men, is hurled suddenly beyond the\r\n      limits. For Nature, as green as she looks, rests everywhere on\r\n      dread foundations, were we farther down; and Pan, to whose music\r\n      the Nymphs dance, has a cry in him that can drive all men\r\n      distracted.\r\n\r\n      Very frightful it is when a Nation, rending asunder its\r\n      Constitutions and Regulations which were grown dead cerements for\r\n      it, becomes _trans_cendental; and must now seek its wild way\r\n      through the New, Chaotic,—where Force is not yet distinguished\r\n      into Bidden and Forbidden, but Crime and Virtue welter\r\n      unseparated,—in that domain of what is called the Passions; of\r\n      what we call the Miracles and the Portents! It is thus that, for\r\n      some three years to come, we are to contemplate France, in this\r\n      final Third Volume of our History. Sansculottism reigning in all\r\n      its grandeur and in all its hideousness: the Gospel (God’s\r\n      Message) of Man’s Rights, Man’s _mights_ or strengths, once more\r\n      preached irrefragably abroad; along with this, and still louder\r\n      for the time, and fearfullest Devil’s-Message of Man’s weaknesses\r\n      and sins;—and all on such a scale, and under such aspect: cloudy\r\n      “death-birth of a world;” huge smoke-cloud, streaked with rays as\r\n      of heaven on one side; girt on the other as with hell-fire!\r\n      History tells us many things: but for the last thousand years and\r\n      more, what thing has she told us of a sort like this? Which\r\n      therefore let us two, O Reader, dwell on willingly, for a little;\r\n      and from its endless significance endeavour to extract what may,\r\n      in present circumstances, be adapted for us.\r\n\r\n      It is unfortunate, though very natural, that the history of this\r\n      Period has so generally been written in hysterics. Exaggeration\r\n      abounds, execration, wailing; and, on the whole, darkness. But\r\n      thus too, when foul old Rome had to be swept from the Earth, and\r\n      those Northmen, and other horrid sons of Nature, came in,\r\n      “swallowing formulas” as the French now do, foul old Rome\r\n      screamed execratively her loudest; so that, the true shape of\r\n      many things is lost for us. Attila’s Huns had arms of such length\r\n      that they could lift a stone without stooping. Into the body of\r\n      the poor Tatars execrative Roman History intercalated an\r\n      alphabetic letter; and so they continue Ta-r-tars, of fell\r\n      Tartarean nature, to this day. Here, in like manner, search as we\r\n      will in these multi-form innumerable French Records, darkness too\r\n      frequently covers, or sheer distraction bewilders. One finds it\r\n      difficult to imagine that the Sun shone in this September month,\r\n      as he does in others. Nevertheless it is an indisputable fact\r\n      that the Sun did shine; and there was weather and work,—nay, as\r\n      to that, very bad weather for harvest work! An unlucky Editor may\r\n      do his utmost; and after all, require allowances.\r\n\r\n      He had been a wise Frenchman, who, looking, close at hand, on\r\n      this waste aspect of a France all stirring and whirling, in ways\r\n      new, untried, had been able to discern where the cardinal\r\n      movement lay; which tendency it was that had the rule and primary\r\n      direction of it then! But at forty-four years’ distance, it is\r\n      different. To all men now, two cardinal movements or grand\r\n      tendencies, in the September whirl, have become discernible\r\n      enough: that stormful effluence towards the Frontiers; that\r\n      frantic crowding towards Townhouses and Council-halls in the\r\n      interior. Wild France dashes, in desperate death-defiance,\r\n      towards the Frontiers, to defend itself from foreign Despots;\r\n      crowds towards Townhalls and Election Committee-rooms, to defend\r\n      itself from domestic Aristocrats. Let the Reader conceive well\r\n      these two cardinal movements; and what side-currents and endless\r\n      vortexes might depend on these. He shall judge too, whether, in\r\n      such sudden wreckage of all old Authorities, such a pair of\r\n      cardinal movements, half-frantic in themselves, could be of soft\r\n      nature? As in dry Sahara, when the winds waken, and lift and\r\n      winnow the immensity of sand! The air itself (Travellers say) is\r\n      a dim sand-air; and dim looming through it, the wonderfullest\r\n      uncertain colonnades of Sand-Pillars rush whirling from this side\r\n      and from that, like so many mad Spinning-Dervishes, of a hundred\r\n      feet in stature; and dance their huge Desert-waltz there!—\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless in all human movements, were they but a day old,\r\n      there is order, or the beginning of order. Consider two things in\r\n      this Sahara-waltz of the French Twenty-five millions; or rather\r\n      one thing, and one hope of a thing: the _Commune_ (Municipality)\r\n      of Paris, which is already here; the National Convention, which\r\n      shall in few weeks be here. The Insurrectionary Commune, which\r\n      improvising itself on the eve of the Tenth of August, worked this\r\n      ever-memorable Deliverance by explosion, must needs rule over\r\n      it,—till the Convention meet. This Commune, which they may well\r\n      call a spontaneous or “improvised” Commune, is, for the present,\r\n      sovereign of France. The Legislative, deriving its authority from\r\n      the Old, how can _it_ now have authority when the Old is exploded\r\n      by insurrection? As a floating piece of wreck, certain things,\r\n      persons and interests may still cleave to it: volunteer\r\n      defenders, riflemen or pikemen in green uniform, or red nightcap\r\n      (of _bonnet rouge_), defile before it daily, just on the wing\r\n      towards Brunswick; with the brandishing of arms; always with some\r\n      touch of Leonidas-eloquence, often with a fire of daring that\r\n      threatens to outherod Herod,—the Galleries, “especially the\r\n      Ladies, never done with applauding.”[512] Addresses of this or\r\n      the like sort can be received and answered, in the hearing of all\r\n      France: the Salle de Manége is still useful as a place of\r\n      proclamation. For which use, indeed, it now chiefly serves.\r\n      Vergniaud delivers spirit-stirring orations; but always with a\r\n      prophetic sense only, looking towards the coming Convention. ‘Let\r\n      our memory perish,’ cries Vergniaud, ‘but let France be\r\n      free!’—whereupon they all start to their feet, shouting\r\n      responsive: ‘Yes, yes, _périsse notre mémoire, pourvu que la\r\n      France soit libre!_’[513] Disfrocked Chabot abjures Heaven that\r\n      at least we may ‘have done with Kings;’ and fast as powder under\r\n      spark, we all blaze up once more, and with waved hats shout and\r\n      swear: ‘Yes, _nous le jurons; plus de roi!_’[514] All which, as a\r\n      method of proclamation, is very convenient.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, that our busy Brissots, rigorous Rolands, men who\r\n      once had authority and now have less and less; men who love law,\r\n      and will have even an Explosion explode itself, as far as\r\n      possible, according to rule, do find this state of matters most\r\n      unofficial unsatisfactory,—is not to be denied. Complaints are\r\n      made; attempts are made: but without effect. The attempts even\r\n      recoil; and must be desisted from, for fear of worse: the sceptre\r\n      is departed from this Legislative once and always. A poor\r\n      Legislative, so hard was fate, had let itself be hand-gyved,\r\n      nailed to the rock like an Andromeda, and could only wail there\r\n      to the Earth and Heavens; miraculously a winged Perseus (or\r\n      Improvised Commune) has dawned out of the void Blue, and cut her\r\n      loose: but whether now is it she, with her softness and musical\r\n      speech, or is it he, with his hardness and sharp falchion and\r\n      aegis, that shall have casting vote? Melodious _agreement_ of\r\n      vote; this were the rule! But if otherwise, and votes diverge,\r\n      then surely Andromeda’s part is to weep,—if possible, tears of\r\n      gratitude alone.\r\n\r\n      Be content, O France, with this Improvised Commune, such as it\r\n      is! It has the implements, and has the hands: the time is not\r\n      long. On Sunday the twenty-sixth of August, our Primary\r\n      Assemblies shall meet, begin electing of Electors; on Sunday the\r\n      second of September (may the day prove lucky!) the Electors shall\r\n      begin electing Deputies; and so an all-healing National\r\n      Convention will come together. No _marc d’argent_, or distinction\r\n      of Active and Passive, now insults the French Patriot: but there\r\n      is universal suffrage, unlimited liberty to choose.\r\n      Old-constituents, Present-Legislators, all France is eligible.\r\n      Nay, it may be said, the flower of all the Universe (_de\r\n      l’Univers_) is eligible; for in these very days we, by act of\r\n      Assembly, “naturalise” the chief Foreign Friends of humanity:\r\n      Priestley, burnt out for us in Birmingham; Klopstock, a genius of\r\n      all countries; Jeremy Bentham, useful Jurisconsult; distinguished\r\n      Paine, the rebellious Needleman;—some of whom may be chosen. As\r\n      is most fit; for a Convention of this kind. In a word, Seven\r\n      Hundred and Forty-five unshackled sovereigns, admired of the\r\n      universe, shall replace this hapless impotency of a\r\n      Legislative,—out of which, it is likely, the best members, and\r\n      the Mountain in mass, may be re-elected. Roland is getting ready\r\n      the _Salles des Cent Suisses_, as preliminary rendezvous for\r\n      them; in that void Palace of the Tuileries, now void and\r\n      National, and not a Palace, but a Caravansera.\r\n\r\n      As for the Spontaneous Commune, one may say that there never was\r\n      on Earth a stranger Town-Council. Administration, not of a great\r\n      City, but of a great Kingdom in a state of revolt and frenzy,\r\n      this is the task that has fallen to it. Enrolling, provisioning,\r\n      judging; devising, deciding, doing, endeavouring to do: one\r\n      wonders the human brain did not give way under all this, and\r\n      reel. But happily human brains have such a talent of taking up\r\n      simply what they can carry, and ignoring all the rest; leaving\r\n      all the rest, as if it were not there! Whereby somewhat is verily\r\n      shifted for; and much shifts for itself. This Improvised Commune\r\n      walks along, nothing doubting; promptly making front, without\r\n      fear or flurry, at what moment soever, to the wants of the\r\n      moment. Were the world on fire, one improvised tricolor Municipal\r\n      has but one life to lose. They are the elixir and chosen-men of\r\n      Sansculottic Patriotism; promoted to the forlorn-hope;\r\n      unspeakable victory or a high gallows, this is their meed. They\r\n      sit there, in the Townhall, these astonishing tricolor\r\n      Municipals; in Council General; in Committee of Watchfulness (_de\r\n      Surveillance_, which will even become _de Salut Public_, of\r\n      Public Salvation), or what other Committees and Sub-committees\r\n      are needful;—managing infinite Correspondence; passing infinite\r\n      Decrees: one hears of a Decree being “the ninety-eighth of the\r\n      day.” Ready! is the word. They carry loaded pistols in their\r\n      pocket; also some improvised luncheon by way of meal. Or indeed,\r\n      by and by, _traiteurs_ contract for the supply of repasts, to be\r\n      eaten on the spot,—too lavishly, as it was afterwards grumbled.\r\n      Thus they: girt in their tricolor sashes; Municipal note-paper in\r\n      the one hand, fire-arms in other. They have their Agents out all\r\n      over France; speaking in townhouses, market-places, highways and\r\n      byways; agitating, urging to arm; all hearts tingling to hear.\r\n      Great is the fire of Anti-Aristocrat eloquence: nay some, as\r\n      Bibliopolic Momoro, seem to hint afar off at something which\r\n      smells of Agrarian Law, and a surgery of the overswoln dropsical\r\n      strong-box itself;—whereat indeed the bold Bookseller runs risk\r\n      of being hanged, and Ex-Constituent Buzot has to smuggle him\r\n      off.[515]\r\n\r\n      Governing Persons, were they never so insignificant\r\n      intrinsically, have for most part plenty of Memoir-writers; and\r\n      the curious, in after-times, can learn minutely their goings out\r\n      and comings in: which, as men always love to know their\r\n      fellow-men in singular situations, is a comfort, of its kind. Not\r\n      so, with these Governing Persons, now in the Townhall! And yet\r\n      what most original fellow-man, of the Governing sort,\r\n      high-chancellor, king, kaiser, secretary of the home or the\r\n      foreign department, ever shewed such a phasis as Clerk Tallien,\r\n      Procureur Manuel, future Procureur Chaumette, here in this\r\n      Sand-waltz of the Twenty-five millions, now do? O brother\r\n      mortals,—thou Advocate Panis, friend of Danton, kinsman of\r\n      Santerre; Engraver Sergent, since called _Agate_ Sergent; thou\r\n      Huguenin, with the tocsin in thy heart! But, as Horace says, they\r\n      wanted the sacred memoir-writer (_sacro vate_); and we know them\r\n      not. Men bragged of August and its doings, publishing them in\r\n      high places; but of this September none now or afterwards would\r\n      brag. The September world remains dark, fuliginous, as Lapland\r\n      witch-midnight;—from which, indeed, very strange shapes will\r\n      evolve themselves.\r\n\r\n      Understand this, however: that incorruptible Robespierre is not\r\n      wanting, now when the brunt of battle is past; in a stealthy way\r\n      the seagreen man sits there, his feline eyes excellent in the\r\n      twilight. Also understand this other, a single fact worth many:\r\n      that Marat is not only there, but has a seat of honour assigned\r\n      him, a _tribune particulière_. How changed for Marat; lifted from\r\n      his dark cellar into this luminous “peculiar tribune!” All dogs\r\n      have their day; even rabid dogs. Sorrowful, incurable Philoctetes\r\n      Marat; without whom Troy cannot be taken! Hither, as a main\r\n      element of the Governing Power, has Marat been raised. Royalist\r\n      types, for we have “suppressed” innumerable Durosoys, Royous, and\r\n      even clapt them in prison,—Royalist types replace the worn types\r\n      often snatched from a People’s-Friend in old ill days. In our\r\n      “peculiar tribune” we write and redact: Placards, of due monitory\r\n      terror; _Amis-du-Peuple_ (now under the name of _Journal de la\r\n      République_); and sit obeyed of men. “Marat,” says one, “is the\r\n      conscience of the Hôtel-de-Ville.” _Keeper_, as some call it, of\r\n      the Sovereign’s Conscience;—which surely, in such hands, will not\r\n      lie hid in a napkin!\r\n\r\n      Two great movements, as we said, agitate this distracted National\r\n      mind: a rushing against domestic Traitors, a rushing against\r\n      foreign Despots. Mad movements both, restrainable by no known\r\n      rule; strongest passions of human nature driving them on: love,\r\n      hatred; vengeful sorrow, braggart Nationality also vengeful,—and\r\n      pale Panic over all! Twelve Hundred slain Patriots, do they not,\r\n      from their dark catacombs there, in Death’s dumb-shew, plead (O\r\n      ye Legislators) for vengeance? Such was the destructive rage of\r\n      these Aristocrats on the ever-memorable Tenth. Nay, apart from\r\n      vengeance, and with an eye to Public Salvation only, are there\r\n      not still, in this Paris (in round numbers) “thirty thousand\r\n      Aristocrats,” of the most malignant humour; driven now to their\r\n      last trump-card?—Be patient, ye Patriots: our New High Court,\r\n      “Tribunal of the Seventeenth,” sits; each Section has sent Four\r\n      Jurymen; and Danton, extinguishing improper judges, improper\r\n      practices wheresoever found, is “the same man you have known at\r\n      the Cordeliers.” With such a Minister of Justice shall not\r\n      Justice be done?—Let it be swift then, answers universal\r\n      Patriotism; swift and sure!—\r\n\r\n      One would hope, this Tribunal of the Seventeenth is swifter than\r\n      most. Already on the 21st, while our Court is but four days old,\r\n      Collenot d’Angremont, “the Royal enlister” (crimp, _embaucheur_)\r\n      dies by torch-light. For, lo, the great _Guillotine_, wondrous to\r\n      behold, now stands there; the Doctor’s _Idea_ has become Oak and\r\n      Iron; the huge cyclopean axe “falls in its grooves like the ram\r\n      of the Pile-engine,” swiftly snuffing out the light of men?”\r\n      “_Mais vous, Gualches_, what have you invented?” _This?_—Poor old\r\n      Laporte, Intendant of the Civil List, follows next; quietly, the\r\n      mild old man. Then Durosoy, Royalist Placarder, “cashier of all\r\n      the Anti-Revolutionists of the interior:” he went rejoicing; said\r\n      that a Royalist like him ought to die, of all days on this day,\r\n      the 25th or Saint Louis’s Day. All these have been tried,\r\n      cast,—the Galleries shouting approval; and handed over to the\r\n      Realised Idea, within a week. Besides those whom we have\r\n      acquitted, the Galleries murmuring, and have dismissed; or even\r\n      have personally guarded back to Prison, as the Galleries took to\r\n      howling, and even to menacing and elbowing.[516] Languid this\r\n      Tribunal is not.\r\n\r\n      Nor does the other movement slacken; the rushing against foreign\r\n      Despots. Strong forces shall meet in death-grip; drilled Europe\r\n      against mad undrilled France; and singular conclusions will be\r\n      tried.—Conceive therefore, in some faint degree, the tumult that\r\n      whirls in this France, in this Paris! Placards from Section, from\r\n      Commune, from Legislative, from the individual Patriot, flame\r\n      monitory on all walls. Flags of Danger to Fatherland wave at the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville; on the Pont Neuf—over the prostrate Statues of\r\n      Kings. There is universal enlisting, urging to enlist; there is\r\n      tearful-boastful leave-taking; irregular marching on the Great\r\n      North-Eastern Road. Marseillese sing their wild _To Arms_, in\r\n      chorus; which now all men, all women and children have learnt,\r\n      and sing chorally, in Theatres, Boulevards, Streets; and the\r\n      heart burns in every bosom: _Aux Armes! Marchons!_—Or think how\r\n      your Aristocrats are skulking into covert; how Bertrand-Moleville\r\n      lies hidden in some garret “in Aubry-le-boucher Street, with a\r\n      poor surgeon who had known me;” Dame de Staël has secreted her\r\n      Narbonne, not knowing what in the world to make of him. The\r\n      Barriers are sometimes open, oftenest shut; no passports to be\r\n      had; Townhall Emissaries, with the eyes and claws of falcons,\r\n      flitting watchful on all points of your horizon! In two words:\r\n      Tribunal of the Seventeenth, busy under howling Galleries;\r\n      Prussian Brunswick, “over a space of forty miles,” with his\r\n      war-tumbrils, and sleeping thunders, and Briarean “sixty-six\r\n      thousand”[517] right-hands,—coming, coming!\r\n\r\n      O Heavens, in these latter days of August, he is come! Durosoy\r\n      was not yet guillotined when news had come that the Prussians\r\n      were harrying and ravaging about Metz; in some four days more,\r\n      one hears that Longwi, our first strong-place on the borders, is\r\n      fallen “in fifteen hours.” Quick, therefore, O ye improvised\r\n      Municipals; quick, and ever quicker!—The improvised Municipals\r\n      make front to this also. Enrolment urges itself; and clothing,\r\n      and arming. Our very officers have now “wool epaulettes;” for it\r\n      is the reign of Equality, and also of Necessity. Neither do men\r\n      now _monsieur_ and _sir_ one another; _citoyen_ (citizen) were\r\n      suitabler; we even say _thou_, as “the free peoples of Antiquity\r\n      did:” so have Journals and the Improvised Commune suggested;\r\n      which shall be well.\r\n\r\n      Infinitely better, meantime, could we suggest, where arms are to\r\n      be found. For the present, our _Citoyens_ chant chorally _To\r\n      arms;_ and have no arms! Arms are searched for; passionately;\r\n      there is joy over any musket. Moreover, entrenchments shall be\r\n      made round Paris: on the slopes of Montmartre men dig and shovel;\r\n      though even the simple suspect this to be desperate. They dig;\r\n      Tricolour sashes speak encouragement and _well-speed-ye_. Nay\r\n      finally “twelve Members of the Legislative go daily,” not to\r\n      encourage only, but to bear a hand, and delve: it was decreed\r\n      with acclamation. Arms shall either be provided; or else the\r\n      ingenuity of man crack itself, and become fatuity. Lean\r\n      Beaumarchais, thinking to serve the Fatherland, and do a stroke\r\n      of trade, in the old way, has commissioned sixty thousand stand\r\n      of good arms out of Holland: would to Heaven, for Fatherland’s\r\n      sake and his, they were come! Meanwhile railings are torn up;\r\n      hammered into pikes: chains themselves shall be welded together,\r\n      into pikes. The very coffins of the dead are raised; for melting\r\n      into balls. All Church-bells must down into the furnace to make\r\n      cannon; all Church-plate into the mint to make money. Also behold\r\n      the fair swan-bevies of _Citoyennes_ that have alighted in\r\n      Churches, and sit there with swan-neck,—sewing tents and\r\n      regimentals! Nor are Patriotic Gifts wanting, from those that\r\n      have aught left; nor stingily given: the fair Villaumes, mother\r\n      and daughter, Milliners in the Rue St.-Martin, give “a silver\r\n      thimble, and a coin of fifteen _sous_ (sevenpence halfpenny),”\r\n      with other similar effects; and offer, at least the mother does,\r\n      to mount guard. Men who have not even a thimble, give a\r\n      thimbleful,—were it but of invention. One Citoyen has wrought out\r\n      the scheme of a wooden cannon; which France shall exclusively\r\n      profit by, in the first instance. It is to be made of _staves_,\r\n      by the coopers;—of almost boundless calibre, but uncertain as to\r\n      strength! Thus they: hammering, scheming, stitching, founding,\r\n      with all their heart and with all their soul. Two bells only are\r\n      to remain in each Parish,—for tocsin and other purposes.\r\n\r\n      But mark also, precisely while the Prussian batteries were\r\n      playing their briskest at Longwi in the North-East, and our\r\n      dastardly Lavergne saw nothing for it but\r\n      surrender,—south-westward, in remote, patriarchal La Vendée, that\r\n      sour ferment about Nonjuring Priests, after long working, is\r\n      ripe, and explodes: at the wrong moment for us! And so we have\r\n      “eight thousand Peasants at Châtillon-sur-Sèvre,” who will not be\r\n      ballotted for soldiers; will not have their Curates molested. To\r\n      whom Bonchamps, Laroche-jaquelins, and Seigneurs enough, of a\r\n      Royalist turn, will join themselves; with Stofflets and\r\n      Charettes; with Heroes and Chouan Smugglers; and the loyal warmth\r\n      of a simple people, blown into flame and fury by theological and\r\n      seignorial bellows! So that there shall be fighting from behind\r\n      ditches, death-volleys bursting out of thickets and ravines of\r\n      rivers; huts burning, feet of the pitiful women hurrying to\r\n      refuge with their children on their back; seedfields fallow,\r\n      whitened with human bones;—“eighty thousand, of all ages, ranks,\r\n      sexes, flying at once across the Loire,” with wail borne far on\r\n      the winds: and, in brief, for years coming, such a suite of\r\n      scenes as glorious war has not offered in these late ages, not\r\n      since our Albigenses and Crusadings were over,—save indeed some\r\n      chance Palatinate, or so, we might have to “burn,” by way of\r\n      exception. The “eight thousand at Chatillon” will be got\r\n      dispelled for the moment; the fire scattered, not extinguished.\r\n      To the dints and bruises of outward battle there is to be added\r\n      henceforth a deadlier internal gangrene.\r\n\r\n      This rising in La Vendée reports itself at Paris on Wednesday the\r\n      29th of August;—just as we had got our Electors elected; and, in\r\n      spite of Brunswick’s and Longwi’s teeth, were hoping still to\r\n      have a National Convention, if it pleased Heaven. But indeed,\r\n      otherwise, this Wednesday is to be regarded as one of the\r\n      notablest Paris had yet seen: gloomy tidings come successively,\r\n      like Job’s messengers; are met by gloomy answers. Of Sardinia\r\n      rising to invade the South-East, and Spain threatening the South,\r\n      we do not speak. But are not the Prussians masters of Longwi\r\n      (treacherously yielded, one would say); and preparing to besiege\r\n      Verdun? Clairfait and his Austrians are encompassing Thionville;\r\n      darkening the North. Not Metz-land now, but the Clermontais is\r\n      getting harried; flying hulans and huzzars have been seen on the\r\n      Chalons Road, almost as far as Sainte-Menehould. Heart, ye\r\n      Patriots, if ye lose heart, ye lose all!\r\n\r\n      It is not without a dramatic emotion that one reads in the\r\n      Parliamentary Debates of this Wednesday evening “past seven\r\n      o’clock,” the scene with the military fugitives from Longwi.\r\n      Wayworn, dusty, disheartened, these poor men enter the\r\n      Legislative, about sunset or after; give the most pathetic detail\r\n      of the frightful pass they were in:—Prussians billowing round by\r\n      the myriad, volcanically spouting fire for fifteen hours: we,\r\n      scattered sparse on the ramparts, hardly a cannoneer to two guns;\r\n      our dastard Commandant Lavergne no where shewing face; the\r\n      priming would not catch; there was no powder in the bombs,—what\r\n      could we do? ‘_Mourir!_ Die!’ answer prompt voices;[518] and the\r\n      dusty fugitives must shrink elsewhither for comfort.—Yes,\r\n      _Mourir_, that is now the word. Be Longwi a proverb and a hissing\r\n      among French strong-places: let it (says the Legislative) be\r\n      obliterated rather, from the shamed face of the Earth;—and so\r\n      there has gone forth Decree, that Longwi shall, were the\r\n      Prussians once out of it, “be rased,” and exist only as ploughed\r\n      ground.\r\n\r\n      Nor are the Jacobins milder; as how could they, the flower of\r\n      Patriotism? Poor Dame Lavergne, wife of the poor Commandant, took\r\n      her parasol one evening, and escorted by her Father came over to\r\n      the Hall of the mighty Mother; and “reads a memoir tending to\r\n      justify the Commandant of Longwi.” _Lafarge, President_, makes\r\n      answer: ‘Citoyenne, the Nation will judge Lavergne; the Jacobins\r\n      are bound to tell him the truth. He would have ended his course\r\n      there (_termine sa carrière_), if he had loved the honour of his\r\n      country.’[519]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.II.\r\n      Danton.\r\n\r\n      But better than rasing of Longwi, or rebuking poor dusty soldiers\r\n      or soldiers’ wives, Danton had come over, last night, and\r\n      demanded a Decree to _search_ for arms, since they were not\r\n      yielded voluntarily. Let “Domiciliary visits,” with rigour of\r\n      authority, be made to this end. To search for arms; for\r\n      horses,—Aristocratism rolls in its carriage, while Patriotism\r\n      cannot trail its cannon. To search generally for munitions of\r\n      war, “in the houses of persons suspect,”—and even, if it seem\r\n      proper, to seize and imprison the suspect persons themselves! In\r\n      the Prisons, their plots will be harmless; in the Prisons, they\r\n      will be as hostages for us, and not without use. This Decree the\r\n      energetic Minister of Justice demanded, last night, and got; and\r\n      this same night it is to be executed; it is being executed, at\r\n      the moment when these dusty soldiers get saluted with _Mourir_.\r\n      Two thousand stand of arms, as they count, are foraged in this\r\n      way; and some four hundred head of new Prisoners; and, on the\r\n      whole, such a terror and damp is struck through the Aristocrat\r\n      heart, as all but Patriotism, and even Patriotism were it out of\r\n      this agony, might pity. Yes, Messieurs! if Brunswick blast Paris\r\n      to ashes, he probably will blast the Prisons of Paris too: pale\r\n      Terror, if we have got it, we will also give it, and the depth of\r\n      horrors that lie in it; the same leaky bottom, in these wild\r\n      waters, bears us all.\r\n\r\n      One can judge what stir there was now among the “thirty thousand\r\n      Royalists:” how the Plotters, or the accused of Plotting, shrank\r\n      each closer into his lurking-place,—like Bertrand Moleville,\r\n      looking eager towards Longwi, hoping the weather would keep fair.\r\n      Or how they dressed themselves in valet’s clothes, like Narbonne,\r\n      and “got to England as Dr. Bollman’s famulus:” how Dame de Staël\r\n      bestirred herself, pleading with Manuel as a Sister in\r\n      Literature, pleading even with Clerk Tallien; a pray to nameless\r\n      chagrins![520] Royalist Peltier, the Pamphleteer, gives a\r\n      touching Narrative (not deficient in height of colouring) of the\r\n      terrors of that night. From five in the afternoon, a great City\r\n      is struck suddenly silent; except for the beating of drums, for\r\n      the tramp of marching feet; and ever and anon the dread thunder\r\n      of the knocker at some door, a Tricolor Commissioner with his\r\n      blue Guards (_black_-guards!) arriving. All Streets are vacant,\r\n      says Peltier; beset by Guards at each end: all Citizens are\r\n      ordered to be within doors. On the River float sentinal barges,\r\n      lest we escape by water: the Barriers hermetically closed.\r\n      Frightful! The sun shines; serenely westering, in smokeless\r\n      mackerel-sky: Paris is as if sleeping, as if dead:—Paris is\r\n      holding its breath, to see what stroke will fall on it. Poor\r\n      Peltier! _Acts of Apostles_, and all jocundity of\r\n      Leading-Articles, are gone out, and it is become bitter earnest\r\n      instead; polished satire changed now into coarse pike-points\r\n      (hammered out of railing); all logic reduced to this one\r\n      primitive thesis, An eye for an eye, a tooth for a\r\n      tooth!—Peltier, dolefully aware of it, ducks low; escapes\r\n      unscathed to England; to urge there the inky war anew; to have\r\n      Trial by Jury, in due season, and deliverance by young Whig\r\n      eloquence, world-celebrated for a day.\r\n\r\n      Of “thirty thousand,” naturally, great multitudes were left\r\n      unmolested: but, as we said, some four hundred, designated as\r\n      “persons suspect,” were seized; and an unspeakable terror fell on\r\n      all. Wo to him who is guilty of Plotting, of Anticivism,\r\n      Royalism, Feuillantism; who, guilty or not guilty, has an enemy\r\n      in his Section to call him guilty! Poor old M. de Cazotte is\r\n      seized, his young loved Daughter with him, refusing to quit him.\r\n      Why, O Cazotte, wouldst thou quit romancing, and _Diable\r\n      Amoureux_, for such reality as this? Poor old M. de Sombreuil, he\r\n      of the _Invalides_, is seized: a man seen askance, by Patriotism\r\n      ever since the Bastille days: whom also a fond Daughter will not\r\n      quit. With young tears hardly suppressed, and old wavering\r\n      weakness rousing itself once more—O my brothers, O my sisters!\r\n\r\n      The famed and named go; the nameless, if they have an accuser.\r\n      Necklace Lamotte’s Husband is in these Prisons (_she_ long since\r\n      squelched on the London Pavements); but gets delivered. Gross de\r\n      Morande, of the _Courier de l’Europe_, hobbles distractedly to\r\n      and fro there: but they let him hobble out; on right nimble\r\n      crutches;—his hour not being yet come. Advocate Maton de la\r\n      Varenne, very weak in health, is snatched off from mother and\r\n      kin; Tricolor Rossignol (journeyman goldsmith and scoundrel\r\n      lately, a risen man now) remembers an old Pleading of Maton’s!\r\n      Jourgniac de Saint-Méard goes; the brisk frank soldier: he was in\r\n      the Mutiny of Nancy, in that “effervescent Regiment du Roi,”—on\r\n      the wrong side. Saddest of all: Abbé Sicard goes; a Priest who\r\n      could not take the Oath, but who could teach the Deaf and Dumb:\r\n      in his Section one man, he says, had a grudge at him; one man, at\r\n      the fit hour, launches an arrest against him; which hits. In the\r\n      Arsenal quarter, there are dumb hearts making wail, with signs,\r\n      with wild gestures; he their miraculous healer and speech-bringer\r\n      is rapt away.\r\n\r\n      What with the arrestments on this night of the Twenty-ninth, what\r\n      with those that have gone on more or less, day and night, ever\r\n      since the Tenth, one may fancy what the Prisons now were.\r\n      Crowding and Confusion; jostle, hurry, vehemence and terror! Of\r\n      the poor Queen’s Friends, who had followed her to the Temple and\r\n      been committed elsewhither to Prison, some, as Governess de\r\n      Tourzelle, are to be let go: one, the poor Princess de Lamballe,\r\n      is not let go; but waits in the strong-rooms of La Force there,\r\n      what will betide further.\r\n\r\n      Among so many hundreds whom the launched arrest hits, who are\r\n      rolled off to Townhall or Section-hall, to preliminary Houses of\r\n      detention, and hurled in thither, as into cattle-pens, we must\r\n      mention one other: Caron de Beaumarchais, Author of _Figaro;_\r\n      vanquisher of Maupeou Parlements and Goezman helldogs; once\r\n      numbered among the demigods; and now—? We left him in his\r\n      culminant state; what dreadful decline is this, when we again\r\n      catch a glimpse of him! “At midnight” (it was but the 12th of\r\n      August yet), “the servant, in his shirt,” with wide-staring eyes,\r\n      enters your room:—Monsieur, rise; all the people are come to seek\r\n      you; they are knocking, like to break in the door! “And they were\r\n      in fact knocking in a terrible manner (_d’une façon terrible_). I\r\n      fling on my coat, forgetting even the waistcoat, nothing on my\r\n      feet but slippers; and say to him”—And _he_, alas, answers mere\r\n      negatory incoherences, panic interjections. And through the\r\n      shutters and crevices, in front or rearward, the dull\r\n      street-lamps disclose only streetfuls of haggard countenances;\r\n      clamorous, bristling with pikes: and you rush distracted for an\r\n      outlet, finding none;—and have to take refuge in the\r\n      crockery-press, down stairs; and stand there, palpitating in that\r\n      imperfect costume, lights dancing past your key-hole, tramp of\r\n      feet overhead, and the tumult of Satan, “for four hours and\r\n      more!” And old ladies, of the quarter, started up (as we hear\r\n      next morning); rang for their _bonnes_ and cordial-drops, with\r\n      shrill interjections: and old gentlemen, in their shirts, “leapt\r\n      garden-walls;” flying, while none pursued; one of whom\r\n      unfortunately broke his leg.[521] Those sixty thousand stand of\r\n      Dutch arms (which never arrive), and the bold stroke of trade,\r\n      have turned out so ill!—\r\n\r\n      Beaumarchais escaped for this time; but not for the next time,\r\n      ten days after. On the evening of the Twenty-ninth he is still in\r\n      that chaos of the Prisons, in saddest, wrestling condition;\r\n      unable to get justice, even to get audience; “Panis scratching\r\n      his head” when you speak to him, and making off. Nevertheless let\r\n      the lover of Figaro know that Procureur Manuel, a Brother in\r\n      Literature, found him, and delivered him once more. But how the\r\n      lean demigod, now shorn of his splendour, had to lurk in barns,\r\n      to roam over harrowed fields, panting for life; and to wait under\r\n      eavesdrops, and sit in darkness “on the Boulevard amid\r\n      paving-stones and boulders,” longing for one word of any\r\n      Minister, or Minister’s Clerk, about those accursed Dutch\r\n      muskets, and getting none,—with heart fuming in spleen, and\r\n      terror, and suppressed canine-madness: alas, how the swift sharp\r\n      hound, once fit to be Diana’s, breaks his old teeth now, gnawing\r\n      mere whinstones; and must “fly to England;” and, returning from\r\n      England, must creep into the corner, and lie quiet, toothless\r\n      (moneyless),—all this let the lover of Figaro fancy, and weep\r\n      for. We here, without weeping, not without sadness, wave the\r\n      withered tough fellow-mortal our farewell. His Figaro has\r\n      returned to the French stage; nay is, at this day, sometimes\r\n      named the best piece there. And indeed, so long as Man’s Life can\r\n      ground itself only on artificiality and aridity; each new Revolt\r\n      and Change of Dynasty turning up only a new stratum of\r\n      _dry-rubbish_, and no _soil_ yet coming to view,—may it not be\r\n      good to protest against such a Life, in many ways, and even in\r\n      the Figaro way?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.III.\r\n      Dumouriez.\r\n\r\n      Such are the last days of August, 1792; days gloomy, disastrous,\r\n      and of evil omen. What will become of this poor France? Dumouriez\r\n      rode from the Camp of Maulde, eastward to Sedan, on Tuesday last,\r\n      the 28th of the month; reviewed that so-called Army left forlorn\r\n      there by Lafayette: the forlorn soldiers gloomed on him; were\r\n      heard growling on him, ‘This is one of them, _ce b—e là_, that\r\n      made War be declared.’[522] Unpromising Army! Recruits flow in,\r\n      filtering through Dépôt after Dépôt; but recruits merely: in want\r\n      of all; happy if they have so much as arms. And Longwi has fallen\r\n      basely; and Brunswick, and the Prussian King, with his sixty\r\n      thousand, will beleaguer Verdun; and Clairfait and Austrians\r\n      press deeper in, over the Northern marches: “a hundred and fifty\r\n      thousand” as fear counts, “eighty thousand” as the returns shew,\r\n      do hem us in; Cimmerian Europe behind them. There is\r\n      Castries-and-Broglie chivalry; Royalist foot “in red facing and\r\n      nankeen trousers;” breathing death and the gallows.\r\n\r\n      And lo, finally! at Verdun on Sunday the 2d of September 1792,\r\n      Brunswick is here. With his King and sixty thousand, glittering\r\n      over the heights, from beyond the winding Meuse River, he looks\r\n      down on us, on our “high citadel” and all our confectionery-ovens\r\n      (for we are celebrated for confectionery) has sent courteous\r\n      summons, in order to spare the effusion of blood!—Resist him to\r\n      the death? Every day of retardation precious? How, O General\r\n      Beaurepaire (asks the amazed Municipality) shall we resist him?\r\n      We, the Verdun Municipals, see no resistance possible. Has he not\r\n      sixty thousand, and artillery without end? Retardation,\r\n      Patriotism is good; but so likewise is peaceable baking of\r\n      pastry, and sleeping in whole skin.—Hapless Beaurepaire stretches\r\n      out his hands, and pleads passionately, in the name of country,\r\n      honour, of Heaven and of Earth: to no purpose. The Municipals\r\n      have, by law, the power of ordering it;—with an Army officered by\r\n      Royalism or Crypto-Royalism, such a Law seemed needful: and they\r\n      order it, as pacific Pastrycooks, not as heroic Patriots\r\n      would,—To surrender! Beaurepaire strides home, with long steps:\r\n      his valet, entering the room, sees him “writing eagerly,” and\r\n      withdraws. His valet hears then, in a few minutes, the report of\r\n      a pistol: Beaurepaire is lying dead; his eager writing had been a\r\n      brief suicidal farewell. In this manner died Beaurepaire, wept of\r\n      France; buried in the Pantheon, with honourable pension to his\r\n      Widow, and for Epitaph these words, _He chose Death rather than\r\n      yield to Despots_. The Prussians, descending from the heights,\r\n      are peaceable masters of Verdun.\r\n\r\n      And so Brunswick advances, from stage to stage: who shall now\r\n      stay him,—covering forty miles of country? Foragers fly far; the\r\n      villages of the North-East are harried; your Hessian forager has\r\n      only “three sous a day:” the very Emigrants, it is said, will\r\n      take silver-plate,—by way of revenge. Clermont, Sainte-Menehould,\r\n      Varennes especially, ye Towns of the _Night of Spurs;_ tremble\r\n      ye! Procureur Sausse and the Magistracy of Varennes have fled;\r\n      brave Boniface Le Blanc of the _Bras d’Or_ is to the woods: Mrs.\r\n      Le Blanc, a young woman fair to look upon, with her young infant,\r\n      has to live in greenwood, like a beautiful Bessy Bell of Song,\r\n      her bower thatched with rushes;—catching premature\r\n      rheumatism.[523] Clermont may ring the tocsin now, and illuminate\r\n      itself! Clermont lies at the foot of its _Cow_ (or _Vache_, so\r\n      they name that Mountain), a prey to the Hessian spoiler: its fair\r\n      women, fairer than most, are robbed: not of life, or what is\r\n      dearer, yet of all that is cheaper and portable; for Necessity,\r\n      on three half-pence a-day, has no law. At Saint-Menehould, the\r\n      enemy has been expected more than once,—our Nationals all turning\r\n      out in arms; but was not yet seen. Post-master Drouet, he is not\r\n      in the woods, but minding his Election; and will sit in the\r\n      Convention, notable King-taker, and bold Old-Dragoon as he is.\r\n\r\n      Thus on the North-East all roams and runs; and on a set day, the\r\n      _date_ of which is irrecoverable by History, Brunswick “has\r\n      engaged to dine in Paris,”—the Powers willing. And at Paris, in\r\n      the centre, it is as we saw; and in La Vendée, South-West, it is\r\n      as we saw; and Sardinia is in the South-East, and Spain is in the\r\n      South, and Clairfait with Austria and sieged Thionville is in the\r\n      North;—and all France leaps distracted, like the winnowed Sahara\r\n      waltzing in sand-colonnades! More desperate posture no country\r\n      ever stood in. A country, one would say, which the Majesty of\r\n      Prussia (if it so pleased him) might partition, and clip in\r\n      pieces, like a Poland; flinging the remainder to poor Brother\r\n      Louis,—with directions to keep it quiet, or else _we_ will keep\r\n      it for him!\r\n\r\n      Or perhaps the Upper Powers, minded that a new Chapter in\r\n      Universal History shall begin here and not further on, may have\r\n      ordered it all otherwise? In that case, Brunswick will not dine\r\n      in Paris on the set day; nor, indeed, one knows not when!—Verily,\r\n      amid this wreckage, where poor France seems grinding itself down\r\n      to dust and bottomless ruin, who knows what miraculous\r\n      salient-point of Deliverance and New-life may have already come\r\n      into existence there; and be already working there, though as yet\r\n      human eye discern it not! On the night of that same twenty-eighth\r\n      of August, the unpromising Review-day in Sedan, Dumouriez\r\n      assembles a Council of War at his lodgings there. He spreads out\r\n      the map of this forlorn war-district: Prussians here, Austrians\r\n      there; triumphant both, with broad highway, and little\r\n      hinderance, all the way to Paris; we, scattered helpless, here\r\n      and here: what to advise? The Generals, strangers to Dumouriez,\r\n      look blank enough; know not well what to advise,—if it be not\r\n      retreating, and retreating till our recruits accumulate; till\r\n      perhaps the chapter of chances turn up some leaf for us; or\r\n      Paris, at all events, be sacked at the latest day possible. The\r\n      Many-counselled, who “has not closed an eye for three nights,”\r\n      listens with little speech to these long cheerless speeches;\r\n      merely watching the speaker that he may know him; then wishes\r\n      them all good-night;—but beckons a certain young Thouvenot, the\r\n      fire of whose looks had pleased him, to wait a moment. Thouvenot\r\n      waits: _Voilà_, says Polymetis, pointing to the map! That is the\r\n      Forest of Argonne, that long stripe of rocky Mountain and wild\r\n      Wood; forty miles long; with but five, or say even three\r\n      practicable Passes through it: this, for they have forgotten it,\r\n      might one not still seize, though Clairfait sits so nigh? Once\r\n      seized;—the Champagne called the Hungry (or worse, Champagne\r\n      _Pouilleuse_) on their side of it; the fat Three Bishoprics, and\r\n      willing France, on ours; and the Equinox-rains not far;—this\r\n      Argonne “might be the Thermopylae of France!”[524]\r\n\r\n      O brisk Dumouriez Polymetis with thy teeming head, may the gods\r\n      grant it!—Polymetis, at any rate, folds his map together, and\r\n      flings himself on bed; resolved to try, on the morrow morning.\r\n      With astucity, with swiftness, with audacity! One had need to be\r\n      a lion-fox, and have luck on one’s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.IV.\r\n      September in Paris.\r\n\r\n      At Paris, by lying Rumour which proved prophetic and veridical,\r\n      the fall of Verdun was known some hours _before_ it happened. It\r\n      is Sunday the second of September; handiwork hinders not the\r\n      speculations of the mind. Verdun gone (though some still deny\r\n      it); the Prussians in full march, with gallows-ropes, with fire\r\n      and faggot! Thirty thousand Aristocrats within our own walls; and\r\n      but the merest quarter-tithe of them yet put in Prison! Nay there\r\n      goes a word that even these will revolt. Sieur Jean Julien,\r\n      wagoner of Vaugirard,[525] being set in the Pillory last Friday,\r\n      took all at once to crying, That he would be well revenged ere\r\n      long; that the King’s Friends in Prison would burst out; force\r\n      the Temple, set the King on horseback; and, joined by the\r\n      unimprisoned, ride roughshod over us all. This the unfortunate\r\n      wagoner of Vaugirard did bawl, at the top of his lungs: when\r\n      snatched off to the Townhall, he persisted in it, still bawling;\r\n      yesternight, when they guillotined him, he died with the froth of\r\n      it on his lips.[526] For a man’s mind, padlocked to the Pillory,\r\n      may go mad; and all men’s minds may go mad; and “believe him,” as\r\n      the frenetic will do, “_because_ it is impossible.”\r\n\r\n      So that apparently the knot of the crisis, and last agony of\r\n      France is come? Make front to this, thou Improvised Commune,\r\n      strong Danton, whatsoever man is strong! Readers can judge\r\n      whether the Flag of Country in Danger flapped soothing or\r\n      distractively on the souls of men, that day.\r\n\r\n      But the Improvised Commune, but strong Danton is not wanting,\r\n      each after his kind. Huge Placards are getting plastered to the\r\n      walls; at two o’clock the stormbell shall be sounded, the\r\n      alarm-cannon fired; all Paris shall rush to the Champ-de-Mars,\r\n      and have itself enrolled. Unarmed, truly, and undrilled; but\r\n      desperate, in the strength of frenzy. Haste, ye men; ye very\r\n      women, offer to mount guard and shoulder the brown musket: weak\r\n      clucking-hens, in a state of desperation, will fly at the muzzle\r\n      of the mastiff, and even conquer him,—by vehemence of character!\r\n      Terror itself, when once grown transcendental, becomes a kind of\r\n      courage; as frost sufficiently intense, according to Poet Milton,\r\n      will _burn_.—Danton, the other night, in the Legislative\r\n      Committee of General Defence, when the other Ministers and\r\n      Legislators had all opined, said, It would not do to quit Paris,\r\n      and fly to Saumur; that they must abide by Paris; and take such\r\n      attitude as would put their enemies in fear,—_faire peur;_ a word\r\n      of his which has been often repeated, and reprinted—in\r\n      italics.[527]\r\n\r\n      At two of the clock, Beaurepaire, as we saw, has shot himself at\r\n      Verdun; and over Europe, mortals are going in for afternoon\r\n      sermon. But at Paris, all steeples are clangouring not for\r\n      sermon; the alarm-gun booming from minute to minute;\r\n      Champ-de-Mars and Fatherland’s Altar boiling with desperate\r\n      terror-courage: what a _miserere_ going up to Heaven from this\r\n      once Capital of the Most Christian King! The Legislative sits in\r\n      alternate awe and effervescence; Vergniaud proposing that Twelve\r\n      shall go and dig personally on Montmartre; which is decreed by\r\n      acclaim.\r\n\r\n      But better than digging personally with acclaim, see Danton\r\n      enter;—the black brows clouded, the colossus-figure tramping\r\n      heavy; grim energy looking from all features of the rugged man!\r\n      Strong is that grim Son of France, and Son of Earth; a Reality\r\n      and not a Formula he too; and surely now if ever, being hurled\r\n      _low_ enough, it is on the Earth and on Realities that he rests.\r\n      ‘Legislators!’ so speaks the stentor-voice, as the Newspapers yet\r\n      preserve it for us, ‘it is not the alarm-cannon that you hear: it\r\n      is the _pas-de-charge_ against our enemies. To conquer them, to\r\n      hurl them back, what do we require? _Il nous faut de l’audace, et\r\n      encore de l’audace, et toujours de l’audace_, To dare, and again\r\n      to dare, and without end to dare!’[528]—Right so, thou brawny\r\n      Titan; there is nothing left for thee but that. Old men, who\r\n      heard it, will still tell you how the reverberating voice made\r\n      all hearts swell, in that moment; and braced them to the\r\n      sticking-place; and thrilled abroad over France, like electric\r\n      virtue, as a word spoken in season.\r\n\r\n      But the Commune, enrolling in the Champ-de-Mars? But the\r\n      Committee of Watchfulness, become now Committee of Public\r\n      Salvation; whose conscience is Marat? The Commune enrolling\r\n      enrolls many; provides Tents for them in that Mars’-Field, that\r\n      they may march with dawn on the morrow: praise to this part of\r\n      the Commune! To Marat and the Committee of Watchfulness not\r\n      praise;—not even blame, such as could be meted out in these\r\n      insufficient dialects of ours; expressive silence rather! Lone\r\n      Marat, the man forbid, meditating long in his Cellars of refuge,\r\n      on his Stylites Pillar, could see salvation in one thing only: in\r\n      the fall of “two hundred and sixty thousand Aristocrat heads.”\r\n      With so many score of Naples Bravoes, each a dirk in his\r\n      right-hand, a muff on his left, he would traverse France, and do\r\n      it. But the world laughed, mocking the severe-benevolence of a\r\n      People’s-Friend; and his idea could not become an action, but\r\n      only a fixed-idea. Lo, now, however, he has come down from his\r\n      Stylites Pillar, to a _Tribune particulière;_ here now, without\r\n      the dirks, without the muffs at least, were it not grown\r\n      possible,—now in the knot of the crisis, when salvation or\r\n      destruction hangs in the hour!\r\n\r\n      The Ice-Tower of Avignon was noised of sufficiently, and lives in\r\n      all memories; but the authors were not punished: nay we saw\r\n      Jourdan Coupe-tete, borne on men’s shoulders, like a copper\r\n      Portent, “traversing the cities of the South.”—What phantasms,\r\n      squalid-horrid, shaking their dirk and muff, may dance through\r\n      the brain of a Marat, in this dizzy pealing of tocsin-miserere,\r\n      and universal frenzy, seek not to guess, O Reader! Nor what the\r\n      cruel Billaud “in his short brown coat was thinking;” nor\r\n      Sergent, not yet _Agate_-Sergent; nor Panis the confident of\r\n      Danton;—nor, in a word, how gloomy Orcus does breed in her gloomy\r\n      womb, and fashion her monsters, and prodigies of Events, which\r\n      thou seest her visibly bear! Terror is on these streets of Paris;\r\n      terror and rage, tears and frenzy: tocsin-miserere pealing\r\n      through the air; fierce desperation rushing to battle; mothers,\r\n      with streaming eyes and wild hearts, sending forth their sons to\r\n      die. “Carriage-horses are seized by the bridle,” that they may\r\n      draw cannon; “the traces cut, the carriages left standing.” In\r\n      such tocsin-miserere, and murky bewilderment of Frenzy, are not\r\n      Murder, Ate, and all Furies near at hand? On slight hint, who\r\n      knows on how slight, may not Murder come; and, with _her_\r\n      snaky-sparkling hand, illuminate this murk!\r\n\r\n      How it was and went, what part might be premeditated, what was\r\n      improvised and accidental, man will never know, till the great\r\n      Day of Judgment make it known. But with a Marat for keeper of the\r\n      Sovereign’s Conscience—And we know what the _ultima ratio_ of\r\n      Sovereigns, when they are driven to it, is! In this Paris there\r\n      are as many wicked men, say a hundred or more, as exist in all\r\n      the Earth: to be hired, and set on; to set on, of their own\r\n      accord, unhired.—And yet we will remark that premeditation itself\r\n      is not performance, is not surety of performance; that it is\r\n      perhaps, at most, surety of _letting_ whosoever wills perform.\r\n      From the purpose of crime to the act of crime there is an abyss;\r\n      wonderful to think of. The finger lies on the pistol; but the man\r\n      is not yet a murderer: nay, his whole nature staggering at such\r\n      consummation, is there not a confused pause rather,—one last\r\n      instant of possibility for him? Not yet a murderer; it is at the\r\n      mercy of light trifles whether the most fixed idea may not yet\r\n      become unfixed. One slight twitch of a muscle, the death flash\r\n      bursts; and he is it, and will for Eternity be it;—and Earth has\r\n      become a penal Tartarus for him; his horizon girdled now not with\r\n      golden hope, but with red flames of remorse; voices from the\r\n      depths of Nature sounding, Wo, wo on him!\r\n\r\n      Of such stuff are we all made; on such powder-mines of bottomless\r\n      guilt and criminality, “if God restrained not; as is well\r\n      said,—does the purest of us walk. There are depths in man that go\r\n      the length of lowest Hell, as there are heights that reach\r\n      highest Heaven;—for are not both Heaven and Hell made out of him,\r\n      made by him, everlasting Miracle and Mystery as he is?—But\r\n      looking on this Champ-de-Mars, with its tent-buildings, and\r\n      frantic enrolments; on this murky-simmering Paris, with its\r\n      crammed Prisons (supposed about to burst), with its\r\n      tocsin-miserere, its mothers’ tears, and soldiers’ farewell\r\n      shoutings,—the pious soul might have prayed, that day, that God’s\r\n      grace would restrain, and greatly restrain; lest on slight hest\r\n      or hint, Madness, Horror and Murder rose, and this Sabbath-day of\r\n      September became a Day black in the Annals of Men.—\r\n\r\n      The tocsin is pealing its loudest, the clocks inaudibly striking\r\n      _Three_, when poor Abbé Sicard, with some thirty other Nonjurant\r\n      Priests, in six carriages, fare along the streets, from their\r\n      preliminary House of Detention at the Townhall, westward towards\r\n      the Prison of the Abbaye. Carriages enough stand deserted on the\r\n      streets; these six move on,—through angry multitudes, cursing as\r\n      they move. Accursed Aristocrat Tartuffes, this is the pass ye\r\n      have brought us to! And now ye will break the Prisons, and set\r\n      Capet Veto on horseback to ride over us? Out upon you, Priests of\r\n      Beelzebub and Moloch; of Tartuffery, Mammon, and the Prussian\r\n      Gallows,—which ye name Mother-Church and God! Such reproaches\r\n      have the poor Nonjurants to endure, and worse; spoken in on them\r\n      by frantic Patriots, who mount even on the carriage-steps; the\r\n      very Guards hardly refraining. Pull up your carriage-blinds!—No!\r\n      answers Patriotism, clapping its horny paw on the carriage blind,\r\n      and crushing it down again. Patience in oppression has limits: we\r\n      are close on the Abbaye, it has lasted long: a poor Nonjurant, of\r\n      quicker temper, smites the horny paw with his cane; nay, finding\r\n      solacement in it, smites the unkempt head, sharply and again more\r\n      sharply, twice over,—seen clearly of us and of the world. It is\r\n      the last that we see clearly. Alas, next moment, the carriages\r\n      are locked and blocked in endless raging tumults; in yells deaf\r\n      to the cry for mercy, which answer the cry for mercy with\r\n      sabre-thrusts through the heart.[529] The thirty Priests are torn\r\n      out, are massacred about the Prison-Gate, one after one,—only the\r\n      poor Abbé Sicard, whom one Moton a watchmaker, knowing him,\r\n      heroically tried to save, and secrete in the Prison, escapes to\r\n      tell;—and it is Night and Orcus, and Murder’s snaky-sparkling\r\n      head _has_ risen in the murk!—\r\n\r\n      From Sunday afternoon (exclusive of intervals, and pauses not\r\n      final) till Thursday evening, there follow consecutively a\r\n      Hundred Hours. Which hundred hours are to be reckoned with the\r\n      hours of the Bartholomew Butchery, of the Armagnac Massacres,\r\n      Sicilian Vespers, or whatsoever is savagest in the annals of this\r\n      world. Horrible the hour when man’s soul, in its paroxysm, spurns\r\n      asunder the barriers and rules; and shews what dens and depths\r\n      are in it! For Night and Orcus, as we say, as was long\r\n      prophesied, have burst forth, here in this Paris, from their\r\n      subterranean imprisonment: hideous, dim, confused; which it is\r\n      painful to look on; and yet which cannot, and indeed which should\r\n      not, be forgotten.\r\n\r\n      The Reader, who looks earnestly through this dim Phantasmagory of\r\n      the Pit, will discern few fixed certain objects; and yet still a\r\n      few. He will observe, in this Abbaye Prison, the sudden massacre\r\n      of the Priests being once over, a strange Court of Justice, or\r\n      call it Court of Revenge and Wild-Justice, swiftly fashion\r\n      itself, and take seat round a table, with the Prison-Registers\r\n      spread before it;—Stanislas Maillard, Bastille-hero, famed Leader\r\n      of the Menads, presiding. O Stanislas, one hoped to meet thee\r\n      elsewhere than here; thou shifty Riding-Usher, with an inkling of\r\n      Law! This work also thou hadst to do; and then—to depart for ever\r\n      from our eyes. At _La Force_, at the _Châtelet_, the\r\n      _Conciergerie_, the like Court forms itself, with the like\r\n      accompaniments: the thing that one man does other men can do.\r\n      There are some Seven Prisons in Paris, full of Aristocrats with\r\n      conspiracies;—nay not even _Bicêtre_ and _Salpêtrière_ shall\r\n      escape, with their Forgers of Assignats: and there are seventy\r\n      times seven hundred Patriot hearts in a state of frenzy.\r\n      Scoundrel hearts also there are; as perfect, say, as the Earth\r\n      holds,—if such are needed. To whom, in this mood, law is as\r\n      no-law; and killing, by what name soever called, is but work to\r\n      be done.\r\n\r\n      So sit these sudden Courts of Wild-Justice, with the\r\n      Prison-Registers before them; unwonted wild tumult howling all\r\n      round: the Prisoners in dread expectancy within. Swift: a name is\r\n      called; bolts jingle, a Prisoner is there. A few questions are\r\n      put; swiftly this sudden Jury decides: Royalist Plotter or not?\r\n      Clearly not; in that case, Let the Prisoner be enlarged With\r\n      _Vive la Nation_. Probably yea; then still, Let the Prisoner be\r\n      enlarged, but without _Vive la Nation;_ or else it may run, Let\r\n      the prisoner be conducted to La Force. At La Force again their\r\n      formula is, Let the Prisoner be conducted to the Abbaye.—‘To La\r\n      Force then!’ Volunteer bailiffs seize the doomed man; he is at\r\n      the outer gate; “enlarged,” or “conducted,”—not into La Force,\r\n      but into a howling sea; forth, under an arch of wild sabres, axes\r\n      and pikes; and sinks, hewn asunder. And another sinks, and\r\n      another; and there forms itself a piled heap of corpses, and the\r\n      kennels begin to run red. Fancy the yells of these men, their\r\n      faces of sweat and blood; the crueller shrieks of these women,\r\n      for there are women too; and a fellow-mortal hurled naked into it\r\n      all! Jourgniac de Saint Méard has seen battle, has seen an\r\n      effervescent Regiment du Roi in mutiny; but the bravest heart may\r\n      quail at this. The Swiss Prisoners, remnants of the Tenth of\r\n      August, “clasped each other spasmodically,” and hung back; grey\r\n      veterans crying: ‘Mercy Messieurs; ah, mercy!’ But there was no\r\n      mercy. Suddenly, however, one of these men steps forward. He had\r\n      a blue frock coat; he seemed to be about thirty, his stature was\r\n      above common, his look noble and martial. ‘I go first,’ said he,\r\n      ‘since it must be so: adieu!’ Then dashing his hat sharply behind\r\n      him: ‘Which way?’ cried he to the Brigands: ‘Shew it me, then.’\r\n      They open the folding gate; he is announced to the multitude. He\r\n      stands a moment motionless; then plunges forth among the pikes,\r\n      and dies of a thousand wounds.”[530]\r\n\r\n      Man after man is cut down; the sabres need sharpening, the\r\n      killers refresh themselves from wine jugs. Onward and onward goes\r\n      the butchery; the loud yells wearying down into bass growls. A\r\n      sombre-faced, shifting multitude looks on; in dull approval, or\r\n      dull disapproval; in dull recognition that it is Necessity. “An\r\n      _Anglais_ in drab greatcoat” was seen, or seemed to be seen,\r\n      serving liquor from his own dram-bottle;—for what purpose, “if\r\n      not set on by Pitt,” Satan and himself know best! Witty Dr. Moore\r\n      grew sick on approaching, and turned into another\r\n      street.[531]—Quick enough goes this Jury-Court; and rigorous. The\r\n      brave are not spared, nor the beautiful, nor the weak. Old M. de\r\n      Montmorin, the Minister’s Brother, was acquitted by the Tribunal\r\n      of the Seventeenth; and conducted back, elbowed by howling\r\n      galleries; but is not acquitted here. Princess de Lamballe has\r\n      lain down on bed: ‘Madame, you are to be removed to the Abbaye.’\r\n      ‘I do not wish to remove; I am well enough here.’ There is a\r\n      need-be for removing. She will arrange her dress a little, then;\r\n      rude voices answer, ‘You have not far to go.’ She too is led to\r\n      the hell-gate; a manifest Queen’s-Friend. She shivers back, at\r\n      the sight of bloody sabres; but there is no return: Onwards! That\r\n      fair hindhead is cleft with the axe; the neck is severed. That\r\n      fair body is cut in fragments; with indignities, and obscene\r\n      horrors of moustachio _grands-lèvres_, which human nature would\r\n      fain find incredible,—which shall be read in the original\r\n      language only. She was beautiful, she was good, she had known no\r\n      happiness. Young hearts, generation after generation, will think\r\n      with themselves: O worthy of worship, thou king-descended,\r\n      god-descended and poor sister-woman! why was not I there; and\r\n      some Sword Balmung, or Thor’s Hammer in my hand? Her head is\r\n      fixed on a pike; paraded under the windows of the Temple; that a\r\n      still more hated, a Marie-Antoinette, may see. One Municipal, in\r\n      the Temple with the Royal Prisoners at the moment, said, ‘Look\r\n      out.’ Another eagerly whispered, ‘Do not look.’ The circuit of\r\n      the Temple is guarded, in these hours, by a long stretched\r\n      tricolor riband: terror enters, and the clangour of infinite\r\n      tumult: hitherto not regicide, though that too may come.\r\n\r\n      But it is more edifying to note what thrillings of affection,\r\n      what fragments of wild virtues turn up, in this shaking asunder\r\n      of man’s existence, for of these too there is a proportion. Note\r\n      old Marquis Cazotte: he is doomed to die; but his young Daughter\r\n      clasps him in her arms, with an inspiration of eloquence, with a\r\n      love which is stronger than very death; the heart of the killers\r\n      themselves is touched by it; the old man is spared. Yet he was\r\n      guilty, if plotting for his King is guilt: in ten days more, a\r\n      Court of Law condemned him, and he had to die elsewhere;\r\n      bequeathing his Daughter a lock of his old grey hair. Or note old\r\n      M. de Sombreuil, who also had a Daughter:—My Father is not an\r\n      Aristocrat; O good gentlemen, I will swear it, and testify it,\r\n      and in all ways prove it; we are not; we hate Aristocrats! ‘Wilt\r\n      thou drink Aristocrats’ blood?’ The man lifts blood (if universal\r\n      Rumour can be credited);[532] the poor maiden does drink. ‘This\r\n      Sombreuil is innocent then!’ Yes indeed,—and now note, most of\r\n      all, how the bloody pikes, at this news, do rattle to the ground;\r\n      and the tiger-yells become bursts of jubilee over a brother\r\n      saved; and the old man and his daughter are clasped to bloody\r\n      bosoms, with hot tears, and borne home in triumph of _Vive la\r\n      Nation_, the killers refusing even money! Does it seem strange,\r\n      this temper of theirs? It seems very certain, well proved by\r\n      Royalist testimony in other instances;[533] and very significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.V.\r\n      A Trilogy.\r\n\r\n      As all Delineation, in these ages, were it never so Epic,\r\n      “speaking itself and not singing itself,” must either found on\r\n      Belief and provable Fact, or have no foundation at all (nor\r\n      except as floating cobweb any existence at all),—the Reader will\r\n      perhaps prefer to take a glance with the very eyes of\r\n      eye-witnesses; and see, in that way, for himself, how it was.\r\n      Brave Jourgniac, innocent Abbé Sicard, judicious Advocate Maton,\r\n      these, greatly compressing themselves, shall speak, each an\r\n      instant. Jourgniac’s _Agony of Thirty-eight Hours_ went through\r\n      “above a hundred editions,” though intrinsically a poor work.\r\n      Some portion of it may here go through above the\r\n      hundred-and-first, for want of a better.\r\n\r\n      “_Towards seven o’clock_” (Sunday night, at the Abbaye; for\r\n      Jourgniac goes by dates): “We saw two men enter, their hands\r\n      bloody and armed with sabres; a turnkey, with a torch, lighted\r\n      them; he pointed to the bed of the unfortunate Swiss, Reding.\r\n      Reding spoke with a dying voice. One of them paused; but the\r\n      other cried _Allons donc;_ lifted the unfortunate man; carried\r\n      him out on his back to the street. He was massacred there.\r\n\r\n      “We all looked at one another in silence, we clasped each other’s\r\n      hands. Motionless, with fixed eyes, we gazed on the pavement of\r\n      our prison; on which lay the moonlight, checkered with the triple\r\n      stancheons of our windows.\r\n\r\n      “_Three in the morning:_ They were breaking-in one of the\r\n      prison-doors. We at first thought they were coming to kill us in\r\n      our room; but heard, by voices on the staircase, that it was a\r\n      room where some Prisoners had barricaded themselves. They were\r\n      all butchered there, as we shortly gathered.\r\n\r\n      “_Ten o’clock:_ The Abbé Lenfant and the Abbé de Chapt-Rastignac\r\n      appeared in the pulpit of the Chapel, which was our prison; they\r\n      had entered by a door from the stairs. They said to us that our\r\n      end was at hand; that we must compose ourselves, and receive\r\n      their last blessing. An electric movement, not to be defined,\r\n      threw us all on our knees, and we received it. These two\r\n      whitehaired old men, blessing us from their place above; death\r\n      hovering over our heads, on all hands environing us; the moment\r\n      is never to be forgotten. Half an hour after, they were both\r\n      massacred, and we heard their cries.”[534]—Thus Jourgniac in his\r\n      _Agony_ in the Abbaye.\r\n\r\n      But now let the good Maton speak, what he, over in La Force, in\r\n      the same hours, is suffering and witnessing. This _Résurrection_\r\n      by him is greatly the best, the least theatrical of these\r\n      Pamphlets; and stands testing by documents:\r\n\r\n      “Towards seven o’clock,” on Sunday night, “prisoners were called\r\n      frequently, and they did not reappear. Each of us reasoned in his\r\n      own way, on this singularity: but our ideas became calm, as we\r\n      persuaded ourselves that the Memorial I had drawn up for the\r\n      National Assembly was producing effect.\r\n\r\n      “At one in the morning, the grate which led to our quarter opened\r\n      anew. Four men in uniform, each with a drawn sabre and blazing\r\n      torch, came up to our corridor, preceded by a turnkey; and\r\n      entered an apartment close to ours, to investigate a box there,\r\n      which we heard them break up. This done, they stept into the\r\n      gallery, and questioned the man Cuissa, to know where Lamotte\r\n      (Necklace’s Widower) was. Lamotte, they said, had some months\r\n      ago, under pretext of a treasure he knew of, swindled a sum of\r\n      three-hundred livres from one of them, inviting him to dinner for\r\n      that purpose. The wretched Cuissa, now in their hands, who indeed\r\n      lost his life this night, answered trembling, That he remembered\r\n      the fact well, but could not tell what was become of Lamotte.\r\n      Determined to find Lamotte and confront him with Cuissa, they\r\n      rummaged, along with this latter, through various other\r\n      apartments; but without effect, for we heard them say: ‘Come\r\n      search among the corpses then: for, _nom de Dieu!_ we must find\r\n      where he is.’\r\n\r\n      “At this time, I heard Louis Bardy, the Abbé Bardy’s name called:\r\n      he was brought out; and directly massacred, as I learnt. He had\r\n      been accused, along with his concubine, five or six years before,\r\n      of having murdered and cut in pieces his own Brother, Auditor of\r\n      the _Chambre des Comptes_ of Montpelier; but had by his subtlety,\r\n      his dexterity, nay his eloquence, outwitted the judges, and\r\n      escaped.\r\n\r\n      “One may fancy what terror these words, ‘Come search among the\r\n      corpses then,’ had thrown me into. I saw nothing for it now but\r\n      resigning myself to die. I wrote my last-will; concluding it by a\r\n      petition and adjuration, that the paper should be sent to its\r\n      address. Scarcely had I quitted the pen, when there came two\r\n      other men in uniform; one of them, whose arm and sleeve up to the\r\n      very shoulder, as well as the sabre, were covered with blood,\r\n      said, He was as weary as a hodman that had been beating plaster.\r\n\r\n      “Baudin de la Chenaye was called; sixty years of virtues could\r\n      not save him. They said, ‘_À l’Abbaye:_’ he passed the fatal\r\n      outer-gate; gave a cry of terror, at sight of the heaped corpses;\r\n      covered his eyes with his hands, and died of innumerable wounds.\r\n      At every new opening of the grate, I thought I should hear my own\r\n      name called, and see Rossignol enter.\r\n\r\n      “I flung off my nightgown and cap; I put on a coarse unwashed\r\n      shirt, a worn frock without waistcoat, an old round hat; these\r\n      things I had sent for, some days ago, in the fear of what might\r\n      happen.\r\n\r\n      “The rooms of this corridor had been all emptied but ours. We\r\n      were four together; whom they seemed to have forgotten: we\r\n      addressed our prayers in common to the Eternal to be delivered\r\n      from this peril.\r\n\r\n      “Baptiste the turnkey came up by himself, to see us. I took him\r\n      by the hands; I conjured him to save us; promised him a hundred\r\n      louis, if he would conduct me home. A noise coming from the\r\n      grates made him hastily withdraw.\r\n\r\n      “It was the noise of some dozen or fifteen men, armed to the\r\n      teeth; as we, lying flat to escape being seen, could see from our\r\n      windows: ‘Up stairs!’ said they: ‘Let not one remain.’ I took out\r\n      my penknife; I considered where I should strike myself,”—but\r\n      reflected “that the blade was too short,” and also “on religion.”\r\n\r\n      Finally, however, between seven and eight o’clock in the morning,\r\n      enter four men with bludgeons and sabres!—“to one of whom Gerard\r\n      my comrade whispered, earnestly, apart. During their colloquy I\r\n      searched every where for shoes, that I might lay off the Advocate\r\n      pumps (_pantoufles de Palais_) I had on,” but could find\r\n      none.—“Constant, called le Sauvage, Gerard, and a third whose\r\n      name escapes me, they let clear off: as for me, four sabres were\r\n      crossed over my breast, and they led me down. I was brought to\r\n      their bar; to the Personage with the scarf, who sat as judge\r\n      there. He was a lame man, of tall lank stature. He recognised me\r\n      on the streets, and spoke to me seven months after. I have been\r\n      assured that he was son of a retired attorney, and named Chepy.\r\n      Crossing the Court called _Des Nourrices_, I saw Manuel\r\n      haranguing in tricolor scarf.” The trial, as we see, ends in\r\n      acquittal and _resurrection_.[535]\r\n\r\n      Poor Sicard, from the _violon_ of the Abbaye, shall say but a few\r\n      words; true-looking, though tremulous. Towards three in the\r\n      morning, the killers bethink them of this little _violon;_ and\r\n      knock from the court. “I tapped gently, trembling lest the\r\n      murderers might hear, on the opposite door, where the Section\r\n      Committee was sitting: they answered gruffly that they had no\r\n      key. There were three of us in this _violon;_ my companions\r\n      thought they perceived a kind of loft overhead. But it was very\r\n      high; only one of us could reach it, by mounting on the shoulders\r\n      of both the others. One of them said to me, that my life was\r\n      usefuller than theirs: I resisted, they insisted: no denial! I\r\n      fling myself on the neck of these two deliverers; never was scene\r\n      more touching. I mount on the shoulders of the first, then on\r\n      those of the second, finally on the loft; and address to my two\r\n      comrades the expression of a soul overwhelmed with natural\r\n      emotions.[536]\r\n\r\n      The two generous companions, we rejoice to find, did not perish.\r\n      But it is time that Jourgniac de Saint-Méard should speak his\r\n      last words, and end this singular trilogy. The night had become\r\n      day; and the day has again become night. Jourgniac, worn down\r\n      with uttermost agitation, has fallen asleep, and had a cheering\r\n      dream: he has also contrived to make acquaintance with one of the\r\n      volunteer bailiffs, and spoken in native Provençal with him. On\r\n      Tuesday, about one in the morning, his _Agony_ is reaching its\r\n      crisis.\r\n\r\n      “By the glare of two torches, I now descried the terrible\r\n      tribunal, where lay my life or my death. The President, in grey\r\n      coats, with a sabre at his side, stood leaning with his hands\r\n      against a table, on which were papers, an inkstand, tobacco-pipes\r\n      and bottles. Some ten persons were around, seated or standing;\r\n      two of whom had jackets and aprons: others were sleeping\r\n      stretched on benches. Two men, in bloody shirts, guarded the door\r\n      of the place; an old turnkey had his hand on the lock. In front\r\n      of the President, three men held a Prisoner, who might be about\r\n      sixty” (or seventy: he was old Marshal Maillé, of the Tuileries\r\n      and August Tenth). “They stationed me in a corner; my guards\r\n      crossed their sabres on my breast. I looked on all sides for my\r\n      Provençal: two National Guards, one of them drunk, presented some\r\n      appeal from the Section of Croix Rouge in favour of the Prisoner;\r\n      the Man in Grey answered: ‘They are useless, these appeals for\r\n      traitors.’ Then the Prisoner exclaimed: ‘It is frightful; your\r\n      judgment is a murder.’ The President answered; ‘My hands are\r\n      washed of it; take M. Maillé away.’ They drove him into the\r\n      street; where, through the opening of the door, I saw him\r\n      massacred.\r\n\r\n      “The President sat down to write; registering, I suppose, the\r\n      name of this one whom they had finished; then I heard him say:\r\n      ‘Another, _À un autre!_’\r\n\r\n      “Behold me then haled before this swift and bloody judgment-bar,\r\n      where the best protection was to have no protection, and all\r\n      resources of ingenuity became null if they were not founded on\r\n      truth. Two of my guards held me each by a hand, the third by the\r\n      collar of my coat. ‘Your name, your profession?’ said the\r\n      President. ‘The smallest lie ruins you,’ added one of the\r\n      judges,—‘My name is Jourgniac Saint-Méard; I have served, as an\r\n      officer, twenty years: and I appear at your tribunal with the\r\n      assurance of an innocent man, who therefore will not lie.’—‘We\r\n      shall see that,’ said the President: ‘Do you know why you are\r\n      arrested?’—‘Yes, Monsieur le President; I am accused of editing\r\n      the Journal _De la Cour et de la Ville_. But I hope to prove the\r\n      falsity’”—\r\n\r\n      But no; Jourgniac’s proof of the falsity, and defence generally,\r\n      though of excellent result as a defence, is not interesting to\r\n      read. It is long-winded; there is a loose theatricality in the\r\n      reporting of it, which does not amount to unveracity, yet which\r\n      tends that way. We shall suppose him successful, beyond hope, in\r\n      proving and disproving; and skip largely,—to the catastrophe,\r\n      almost at two steps.\r\n\r\n      “‘But after all,’ said one of the Judges, ‘there is no smoke\r\n      without kindling; tell us why they accuse you of that.’—‘I was\r\n      about to do so’”—Jourgniac does so; with more and more success.\r\n\r\n      “‘Nay,’ continued I, ‘they accuse me even of recruiting for the\r\n      Emigrants!’ At these words there arose a general murmur. ‘O\r\n      Messieurs, Messieurs,’ I exclaimed, raising my voice, ‘it is my\r\n      turn to speak; I beg M. le President to have the kindness to\r\n      maintain it for me; I never needed it more.’—‘True enough, true\r\n      enough,’ said almost all the judges with a laugh: ‘Silence!’\r\n\r\n      “While they were examining the testimonials I had produced, a new\r\n      Prisoner was brought in, and placed before the President. ‘It was\r\n      one Priest more,’ they said, ‘whom they had ferreted out of the\r\n      Chapelle.’ After very few questions: ‘_À la Force!_’ He flung his\r\n      breviary on the table: was hurled forth, and massacred. I\r\n      reappeared before the tribunal.\r\n\r\n      “‘You tell us always,’ cried one of the judges, with a tone of\r\n      impatience, ‘that you are not this, that you are not that: what\r\n      are you then?’—‘I was an open Royalist.’—There arose a general\r\n      murmur; which was miraculously appeased by another of the men,\r\n      who had seemed to take an interest in me: ‘We are not here to\r\n      judge opinions,’ said he, ‘but to judge the results of them.’\r\n      Could Rousseau and Voltaire both in one, pleading for me, have\r\n      said better?—‘Yes, Messieurs,’ cried I, ‘always till the Tenth of\r\n      August, I was an open Royalist. Ever since the Tenth of August\r\n      that cause has been finished. I am a Frenchman, true to my\r\n      country. I was always a man of honour.’\r\n\r\n      “‘My soldiers never distrusted me. Nay, two days before that\r\n      business of Nanci, when their suspicion of their officers was at\r\n      its height, they chose me for commander, to lead them to\r\n      Lunéville, to get back the prisoners of the Regiment\r\n      Mestre-de-Camp, and seize General Malseigne.’” Which fact there\r\n      is, most luckily, an individual present who by a certain token\r\n      can confirm.\r\n\r\n      “The President, this cross-questioning being over, took off his\r\n      hat and said: ‘I see nothing to suspect in this man; I am for\r\n      granting him his liberty. Is that your vote?’ To which all the\r\n      judges answered: ‘_Oui, oui;_ it is just!’”\r\n\r\n      And there arose vivats within doors and without; “escort of\r\n      three,” amid shoutings and embracings: thus Jourgniac escaped\r\n      from jury-trial and the jaws of death.[537] Maton and Sicard did,\r\n      either by trial, and no bill found, lank President Chepy finding\r\n      “absolutely nothing;” or else by evasion, and new favour of Moton\r\n      the brave watchmaker, likewise escape; and were embraced, and\r\n      wept over; weeping in return, as they well might.\r\n\r\n      Thus they three, in wondrous trilogy, or triple soliloquy;\r\n      uttering simultaneously, through the dread night-watches, their\r\n      Night-thoughts,—grown audible to us! They Three are become\r\n      audible: but the other “Thousand and Eighty-nine, of whom Two\r\n      Hundred and Two were Priests,” who also had Night-thoughts,\r\n      remain inaudible; choked for ever in black Death. Heard only of\r\n      President Chepy and the Man in Grey!—\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.VI.\r\n      The Circular.\r\n\r\n      But the Constituted Authorities, all this while? The Legislative\r\n      Assembly; the Six Ministers; the Townhall; Santerre with the\r\n      National Guard?—It is very curious to think what a City is.\r\n      Theatres, to the number of some twenty-three, were open every\r\n      night during these prodigies: while right-arms here grew weary\r\n      with slaying, right-arms there are twiddledeeing on melodious\r\n      catgut; at the very instant when Abbé Sicard was clambering up\r\n      his second pair of shoulders, three-men high, five hundred\r\n      thousand human individuals were lying horizontal, as if nothing\r\n      were amiss.\r\n\r\n      As for the poor Legislative, the sceptre had departed from it.\r\n      The Legislative did send Deputation to the Prisons, to the\r\n      Street-Courts; and poor M. Dusaulx did harangue there; but\r\n      produced no conviction whatsoever: nay, at last, as he continued\r\n      haranguing, the Street-Court interposed, not without threats; and\r\n      he had to cease, and withdraw. This is the same poor worthy old\r\n      M. Dusaulx who told, or indeed almost sang (though with cracked\r\n      voice), the _Taking of the Bastille_,—to our satisfaction long\r\n      since. He was wont to announce himself, on such and on all\r\n      occasions, as _the Translator of Juvenal_. ‘Good Citizens, you\r\n      see before you a man who loves his country, who is the Translator\r\n      of Juvenal,’ said he once.—‘Juvenal?’ interrupts Sansculottism:\r\n      ‘who the devil is Juvenal? One of your _sacrés Aristocrates?_ To\r\n      the _Lanterne!_’ From an orator of this kind, conviction was not\r\n      to be expected. The Legislative had much ado to save one of its\r\n      own Members, or Ex-Members, Deputy Journeau, who chanced to be\r\n      lying in arrest for mere Parliamentary delinquencies, in these\r\n      Prisons. As for poor old Dusaulx and Company, they returned to\r\n      the Salle de Manége, saying, ‘It was dark; and they could not see\r\n      well what was going on.’[538]\r\n\r\n      Roland writes indignant messages, in the name of Order, Humanity,\r\n      and the Law; but there is no Force at his disposal. Santerre’s\r\n      National Force seems lazy to rise; though he made requisitions,\r\n      he says,—which always dispersed again. Nay did not we, with\r\n      Advocate Maton’s eyes, see ‘men in uniform,’ too, with their\r\n      ‘sleeves bloody to the shoulder?’ Pétion goes in tricolor scarf;\r\n      speaks ‘the austere language of the law:’ the killers give up,\r\n      while he is there; when his back is turned, recommence. Manuel\r\n      too in scarf we, with Maton’s eyes, transiently saw haranguing,\r\n      in the Court called of Nurses, _Cour des Nourrices_. On the other\r\n      hand, cruel Billaud, likewise in scarf, “with that small puce\r\n      coat and black wig we are used to on him,”[539] audibly delivers,\r\n      “standing among corpses,” at the Abbaye, a short but\r\n      ever-memorable harangue, reported in various phraseology, but\r\n      always to this purpose: ‘Brave Citizens, you are extirpating the\r\n      Enemies of Liberty; you are at your duty. A grateful Commune, and\r\n      Country, would wish to recompense you adequately; but cannot, for\r\n      you know its want of funds. Whoever shall have worked\r\n      (_travaillé_) in a Prison shall receive a draft of one louis,\r\n      payable by our cashier. Continue your work.’[540]—The Constituted\r\n      Authorities are of yesterday; all pulling different ways: there\r\n      is properly not Constituted Authority, but every man is his own\r\n      King; and all are kinglets, belligerent, allied, or\r\n      armed-neutral, without king over them.\r\n\r\n      “O everlasting infamy,” exclaims Montgaillard, “that Paris stood\r\n      looking on in stupor for four days, and did not interfere!” Very\r\n      desirable indeed that Paris had interfered; yet not unnatural\r\n      that it stood even so, looking on in stupor. Paris is in\r\n      death-panic, the enemy and gibbets at its door: whosoever in\r\n      Paris has the heart to front death finds it more pressing to do\r\n      it fighting the Prussians, than fighting the killers of\r\n      Aristocrats. Indignant abhorrence, as in Roland, may be here;\r\n      gloomy sanction, premeditation or not, as in Marat and Committee\r\n      of Salvation, may be there; dull disapproval, dull approval, and\r\n      acquiescence in Necessity and Destiny, is the general temper. The\r\n      Sons of Darkness, “two hundred or so,” risen from their\r\n      lurking-places, have scope to do their work. Urged on by\r\n      fever-frenzy of Patriotism, and the madness of Terror;—urged on\r\n      by lucre, and the gold louis of wages? Nay, not lucre: for the\r\n      gold watches, rings, money of the Massacred, are punctually\r\n      brought to the Townhall, by Killers sans-indispensables, who\r\n      higgle afterwards for their twenty shillings of wages; and\r\n      Sergent sticking an uncommonly fine agate on his finger (“fully\r\n      meaning to account for it”), becomes _Agate_-Sergent. But the\r\n      temper, as we say, is dull acquiescence. Not till the Patriotic\r\n      or Frenetic part of the work is finished for want of material;\r\n      and Sons of Darkness, bent clearly on lucre alone, begin\r\n      wrenching watches and purses, brooches from ladies’ necks “to\r\n      equip volunteers,” in daylight, on the streets,—does the temper\r\n      from dull grow vehement; does the Constable raise his truncheon,\r\n      and striking heartily (like a cattle-driver in earnest) beat the\r\n      “course of things” back into its old regulated drove-roads. The\r\n      _Garde-Meuble_ itself was surreptitiously plundered, on the 17th\r\n      of the Month, to Roland’s new horror; who anew bestirs himself,\r\n      and is, as Sieyes says, “the veto of scoundrels,” Roland _veto\r\n      des coquins_.[541]—\r\n\r\n      This is the September Massacre, otherwise called “Severe Justice\r\n      of the People.” These are the Septemberers (_Septembriseurs_); a\r\n      name of some note and lucency,—but lucency of the Nether-fire\r\n      sort; very different from that of our Bastille Heroes, who shone,\r\n      disputable by no Friend of Freedom, as in heavenly\r\n      light-radiance: to such phasis of the business have we advanced\r\n      since then! The numbers massacred are, in Historical _fantasy_,\r\n      “between two and three thousand;” or indeed they are “upwards of\r\n      six thousand,” for Peltier (in vision) saw them massacring the\r\n      very patients of the Bicêtre Madhouse “with grape-shot;” nay\r\n      finally they are “twelve thousand” and odd hundreds,—not more\r\n      than that.[542] In Arithmetical ciphers, and Lists drawn up by\r\n      accurate Advocate Maton, the number, including two hundred and\r\n      two priests, three “persons unknown,” and “one thief killed at\r\n      the Bernardins,” is, as above hinted, a Thousand and\r\n      Eighty-nine,—no less than that.\r\n\r\n      A thousand and eighty-nine lie dead, “two hundred and sixty\r\n      heaped carcasses on the Pont au Change” itself;—among which,\r\n      Robespierre pleading afterwards will “nearly weep” to reflect\r\n      that there was said to be one slain innocent.[543] One; not two,\r\n      O thou seagreen Incorruptible? If so, Themis Sansculotte must be\r\n      lucky; for she was brief!—In the dim Registers of the Townhall,\r\n      which are preserved to this day, men read, with a certain\r\n      sickness of heart, items and entries not usual in Town Books: “To\r\n      workers employed in preserving the salubrity of the air in the\r\n      Prisons, and persons “who presided over these dangerous\r\n      operations,” so much,—in various items, nearly seven hundred\r\n      pounds sterling. To carters employed to “the Burying-grounds of\r\n      Clamart, Montrouge, and Vaugirard,” at so much a journey, per\r\n      cart; this also is an entry. Then so many francs and odd sous\r\n      “for the necessary quantity of quick-lime!”[544] Carts go along\r\n      the streets; full of stript human corpses, thrown pellmell; limbs\r\n      sticking up:—seest thou that cold Hand sticking up, through the\r\n      heaped embrace of brother corpses, in its yellow paleness, in its\r\n      cold rigour; the palm opened towards Heaven, as if in dumb\r\n      prayer, in expostulation _de profundis_, Take pity on the Sons of\r\n      Men!—Mercier saw it, as he walked down “the Rue Saint-Jacques\r\n      from Montrouge, on the morrow of the Massacres:” but not a Hand;\r\n      it was a Foot,—which he reckons still more significant, one\r\n      understands not well why. Or was it as the Foot of one _spurning_\r\n      Heaven? Rushing, like a wild diver, in disgust and despair,\r\n      towards the depths of Annihilation? Even there shall His hand\r\n      find thee, and His right-hand hold thee,—surely for right not for\r\n      wrong, for good not evil! “I saw that Foot,” says Mercier; “I\r\n      shall know it again at the great Day of Judgment, when the\r\n      Eternal, throned on his thunders, shall judge both Kings and\r\n      Septemberers.”[545]\r\n\r\n      That a shriek of inarticulate horror rose over this thing, not\r\n      only from French Aristocrats and Moderates, but from all Europe,\r\n      and has prolonged itself to the present day, was most natural and\r\n      right. The thing lay done, irrevocable; a thing to be counted\r\n      besides some other things, which lie very black in our Earth’s\r\n      Annals, yet which will not erase therefrom. For man, as was\r\n      remarked, has transcendentalisms in him; standing, as he does,\r\n      poor creature, every way “in the confluence of Infinitudes;” a\r\n      mystery to himself and others: in the centre of two Eternities,\r\n      of three Immensities,—in the intersection of primeval Light with\r\n      the everlasting dark! Thus have there been, especially by\r\n      vehement tempers reduced to a state of desperation, very\r\n      miserable things done. Sicilian Vespers, and “eight thousand\r\n      slaughtered in two hours,” are a known thing. Kings themselves,\r\n      not in desperation, but only in difficulty, have sat hatching,\r\n      for year and day (nay De Thou says, for seven years), their\r\n      Bartholomew Business; and then, at the right moment, also on an\r\n      Autumn Sunday, this very Bell (they say it is the identical\r\n      metal) of St. Germain l’Auxerrois was set a-pealing—with\r\n      effect.[546] Nay the same black boulder-stones of these Paris\r\n      Prisons have seen Prison-massacres before now; men massacring\r\n      countrymen, Burgundies massacring Armagnacs, whom they had\r\n      suddenly imprisoned, till as now there are piled heaps of\r\n      carcasses, and the streets ran red;—the Mayor Pétion of the time\r\n      speaking the austere language of the law, and answered by the\r\n      Killers, in old French (it is some four hundred years old):\r\n      ‘_Maugré bieu, Sire_,—Sir, God’s malison on your justice, your\r\n      pity, your right reason. Cursed be of God whoso shall have pity\r\n      on these false traitorous Armagnacs, English; dogs they are; they\r\n      have destroyed us, wasted this realm of France, and sold it to\r\n      the English.’[547] And so they slay, and fling aside the slain,\r\n      to the extent of “fifteen hundred and eighteen, among whom are\r\n      found four Bishops of false and damnable counsel, and two\r\n      Presidents of Parlement.” For though it is not Satan’s world this\r\n      that we live in, Satan always has his place in it (underground\r\n      properly); and from time to time bursts up. Well may mankind\r\n      shriek, inarticulately anathematising as they can. There are\r\n      actions of such emphasis that no shrieking can be too emphatic\r\n      for them. Shriek ye; acted have they.\r\n\r\n      Shriek who might in this France, in this Paris Legislative or\r\n      Paris Townhall, there are Ten Men who do not shriek. A Circular\r\n      goes out from the Committee of _Salut Public_, dated 3rd of\r\n      September 1792; directed to all Townhalls: a State-paper too\r\n      remarkable to be overlooked. “A part of the ferocious\r\n      conspirators detained in the Prisons,” it says, “have been put to\r\n      death by the People; and it,” the Circular, “cannot doubt but the\r\n      whole Nation, driven to the edge of ruin by such endless series\r\n      of treasons, will make haste to adopt _this_ means of public\r\n      salvation; and all Frenchmen will cry as the men of Paris: We go\r\n      to fight the enemy, but we will not leave robbers behind us, to\r\n      butcher our wives and children.” To which are legibly appended\r\n      these signatures: Panis, Sergent; Marat, Friend of the\r\n      People;[548] with Seven others;—carried down thereby, in a\r\n      strange way, to the late remembrance of Antiquarians. We remark,\r\n      however, that their Circular rather recoiled on themselves. The\r\n      Townhalls made no use of it; even the distracted Sansculottes\r\n      made little; they only howled and bellowed, but did not bite. At\r\n      Rheims “about eight persons” were killed; and two afterwards were\r\n      hanged for doing it. At Lyons, and a few other places, some\r\n      attempt was made; but with hardly any effect, being quickly put\r\n      down.\r\n\r\n      Less fortunate were the Prisoners of Orléans; was the good Duke\r\n      de la Rochefoucault. He journeying, by quick stages, with his\r\n      Mother and Wife, towards the Waters of Forges, or some quieter\r\n      country, was arrested at Gisors; conducted along the streets,\r\n      amid effervescing multitudes, and killed dead “by the stroke of a\r\n      paving-stone hurled through the coach-window.” Killed as a once\r\n      Liberal now Aristocrat; Protector of Priests, Suspender of\r\n      virtuous Pétions, and his unfortunate Hot-grown-cold, detestable\r\n      to Patriotism. He dies lamented of Europe; his blood spattering\r\n      the cheeks of his old Mother, ninety-three years old.\r\n\r\n      As for the Orléans Prisoners, they are State Criminals: Royalist\r\n      Ministers, Delessarts, Montmorins; who have been accumulating on\r\n      the High Court of Orléans, ever since that Tribunal was set up.\r\n      Whom now it seems good that we should get transferred to our new\r\n      Paris Court of the Seventeenth; which proceeds far quicker.\r\n      Accordingly hot Fournier from Martinique, Fournier _l’Americain_,\r\n      is off, missioned by Constituted Authority; with stanch National\r\n      Guards, with Lazouski the Pole; sparingly provided with\r\n      road-money. These, through bad quarters, through difficulties,\r\n      perils, for Authorities cross each other in this time,—do\r\n      triumphantly bring off the Fifty or Fifty-three Orléans\r\n      Prisoners, towards Paris; where a swifter Court of the\r\n      Seventeenth will do justice on them.[549] But lo, at Paris, in\r\n      the interim, a still swifter and swiftest Court of the _Second_,\r\n      and of _September_, has instituted itself: enter not Paris, or\r\n      that will judge you!—What shall hot Fournier do? It was his duty,\r\n      as volunteer Constable, had he been a perfect character, to guard\r\n      those men’s lives never so Aristocratic, at the expense of his\r\n      own valuable life never so Sansculottic, till some Constituted\r\n      Court had disposed of them. But he was an imperfect character and\r\n      Constable; perhaps one of the more imperfect.\r\n\r\n      Hot Fournier, ordered to turn thither by one Authority, to turn\r\n      thither by another Authority, is in a perplexing multiplicity of\r\n      orders; but finally he strikes off for Versailles. His Prisoners\r\n      fare in tumbrils, or open carts, himself and Guards riding and\r\n      marching around: and at the last village, the worthy Mayor of\r\n      Versailles comes to meet him, anxious that the arrival and\r\n      locking up were well over. It is Sunday, the ninth day of the\r\n      month. Lo, on entering the Avenue of Versailles, what multitudes,\r\n      stirring, swarming in the September sun, under the dull-green\r\n      September foliage; the Four-rowed Avenue all humming and\r\n      swarming, as if the Town had emptied itself! Our tumbrils roll\r\n      heavily through the living sea; the Guards and Fournier making\r\n      way with ever more difficulty; the Mayor speaking and gesturing\r\n      his persuasivest; amid the inarticulate growling hum, which\r\n      growls ever the deeper even by hearing itself growl, not without\r\n      sharp yelpings here and there:—Would to God we were out of this\r\n      strait place, and wind and separation had cooled the heat, which\r\n      seems about igniting here!\r\n\r\n      And yet if the wide Avenue is too strait, what will the Street\r\n      _de Surintendance_ be, at leaving of the same? At the corner of\r\n      Surintendance Street, the compressed yelpings became a continuous\r\n      yell: savage figures spring on the tumbril-shafts; first spray of\r\n      an endless coming tide! The Mayor pleads, pushes, half-desperate;\r\n      is pushed, carried off in men’s arms: the savage tide has\r\n      entrance, has mastery. Amid horrid noise, and tumult as of fierce\r\n      wolves, the Prisoners sink massacred,—all but some eleven, who\r\n      escaped into houses, and found mercy. The Prisons, and what other\r\n      Prisoners they held, were with difficulty saved. The stript\r\n      clothes are burnt in bonfire; the corpses lie heaped in the ditch\r\n      on the morrow morning.[550] All France, except it be the Ten Men\r\n      of the Circular and their people, moans and rages, inarticulately\r\n      shrieking; all Europe rings.\r\n\r\n      But neither did Danton shriek; though, as Minister of Justice, it\r\n      was more his part to do so. Brawny Danton is in the breach, as of\r\n      stormed Cities and Nations; amid the Sweep of Tenth-of-August\r\n      cannon, the rustle of Prussian gallows-ropes, the smiting of\r\n      September sabres; destruction all round him, and the rushing-down\r\n      of worlds: Minister of Justice is his name; but Titan of the\r\n      Forlorn Hope, and _Enfant Perdu_ of the Revolution, is his\r\n      quality,—and the man acts according to that. ‘We must put our\r\n      enemies in fear!’ Deep fear, is it not, as of its own accord,\r\n      falling on our enemies? The Titan of the Forlorn Hope, he is not\r\n      the man that would swiftest of all prevent its so falling.\r\n      Forward, thou lost Titan of an _Enfant Perdu;_ thou must dare,\r\n      and again dare, and without end dare; there is nothing left for\r\n      thee but that! ‘_Que mon nom soit flétri_, Let my name be\r\n      blighted:’ what am I? The Cause alone is great; and shall live,\r\n      and not perish.—So, on the whole, here too is a swallower of\r\n      Formulas; of still wider gulp than Mirabeau: this Danton,\r\n      Mirabeau of the Sansculottes. In the September days, this\r\n      Minister was not heard of as co-operating with strict Roland; his\r\n      business might lie elsewhere,—with Brunswick and the\r\n      Hôtel-de-Ville. When applied to by an official person, about the\r\n      Orleans Prisoners, and the risks they ran, he answered gloomily,\r\n      twice over, ‘Are not these men guilty?’—When pressed, he\r\n      “answered in a terrible voice,” and turned his back.[551] Two\r\n      Thousand slain in the Prisons; horrible if you will: but\r\n      Brunswick is within a day’s journey of us; and there are Five-and\r\n      twenty Millions yet, to slay or to save. Some men have\r\n      tasks,—frightfuller than ours! It seems strange, but is not\r\n      strange, that this Minister of Moloch-Justice, when any suppliant\r\n      for a friend’s life got access to him, was found to have human\r\n      compassion; and yielded and granted “always;” “neither did one\r\n      personal enemy of Danton perish in these days.”[552]\r\n\r\n      To shriek, we say, when certain things are acted, is proper and\r\n      unavoidable. Nevertheless, articulate speech, not shrieking, is\r\n      the faculty of man: when speech is not yet possible, let there\r\n      be, with the shortest delay, at least—silence. Silence,\r\n      accordingly, in this forty-fourth year of the business, and\r\n      eighteen hundred and thirty-sixth of an “Era called Christian as\r\n      _lucus à non_,” is the thing we recommend and practise. Nay,\r\n      instead of shrieking more, it were perhaps edifying to remark, on\r\n      the other side, what a singular thing Customs (in Latin, _Mores_)\r\n      are; and how fitly the Virtue, _Vir-tus_, Manhood or Worth, that\r\n      is in a man, is called his _Morality_, or _Customariness_. Fell\r\n      Slaughter, one the most authentic products of the Pit you would\r\n      say, once give it Customs, becomes War, with Laws of War; and is\r\n      Customary and Moral enough; and red individuals carry the tools\r\n      of it girt round their haunches, not without an air of\r\n      pride,—which do thou nowise blame. While, see! so long as it is\r\n      but dressed in hodden or russet; and Revolution, less frequent\r\n      than War, has not yet got its Laws of Revolution, but the hodden\r\n      or russet individuals are Uncustomary—O shrieking beloved brother\r\n      blockheads of Mankind, let us close those wide mouths of ours;\r\n      let us cease shrieking, and begin considering!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.VII.\r\n      September in Argonne.\r\n\r\n      Plain, at any rate, is one thing: that the _fear_, whatever of\r\n      fear those Aristocrat enemies might need, has been brought about.\r\n      The matter is getting serious then! Sansculottism too has become\r\n      a Fact, and seems minded to assert itself as such? This huge\r\n      mooncalf of Sansculottism, staggering about, as young calves do,\r\n      is not mockable only, and soft like another calf; but terrible\r\n      too, if you prick it; and, through its hideous nostrils, blows\r\n      fire!—Aristocrats, with pale panic in their hearts, fly towards\r\n      covert; and a light rises to them over several things; or rather\r\n      a confused transition towards light, whereby for the moment\r\n      darkness is only darker than ever. But, What will become of this\r\n      France? Here is a question! France is dancing its desert-waltz,\r\n      as Sahara does when the winds waken; in whirlblasts twenty-five\r\n      millions in number; waltzing towards Townhalls, Aristocrat\r\n      Prisons, and Election Committee-rooms; towards Brunswick and the\r\n      Frontiers;—towards a New Chapter of Universal History; if indeed\r\n      it be not the _Finis_, and winding-up of that!\r\n\r\n      In Election Committee-rooms there is now no dubiety; but the work\r\n      goes bravely along. The Convention is getting chosen,—really in a\r\n      decisive spirit; in the Townhall we already date _First year of\r\n      the Republic_. Some Two hundred of our best Legislators may be\r\n      re-elected, the Mountain bodily: Robespierre, with Mayor Pétion,\r\n      Buzot, Curate Grégoire, Rabaut, some three score\r\n      Old-Constituents; though we once had only “thirty voices.” All\r\n      these; and along with them, friends long known to Revolutionary\r\n      fame: Camille Desmoulins, though he stutters in speech; Manuel,\r\n      Tallien and Company; Journalists Gorsas, Carra, Mercier, Louvet\r\n      of _Faublas;_ Clootz Speaker of Mankind; Collot d’Herbois,\r\n      tearing a passion to rags; Fabre d’Eglantine, speculative\r\n      Pamphleteer; Legendre the solid Butcher; nay Marat, though rural\r\n      France can hardly believe it, or even believe that there _is_ a\r\n      Marat except in print. Of Minister Danton, who will lay down his\r\n      Ministry for a Membership, we need not speak. Paris is fervent;\r\n      nor is the Country wanting to itself. Barbaroux, Rebecqui, and\r\n      fervid Patriots are coming from Marseilles. Seven hundred and\r\n      forty-five men (or indeed forty-nine, for Avignon now sends Four)\r\n      are gathering: so many are to meet; not so many are to part!\r\n\r\n      Attorney Carrier from Aurillac, Ex-Priest Lebon from Arras, these\r\n      shall both gain a _name_. Mountainous Auvergne re-elects her\r\n      Romme: hardy tiller of the soil, once Mathematical Professor;\r\n      who, unconscious, carries in petto a remarkable _New Calendar_,\r\n      with Messidors, Pluvioses, and such like;—and having given it\r\n      well forth, shall depart by the death they call Roman. Sieyes\r\n      old-Constituent comes; to make new Constitutions as many as\r\n      wanted: for the rest, peering out of his clear cautious eyes, he\r\n      will cower low in many an emergency, and find silence safest.\r\n      Young Saint-Just is coming, deputed by Aisne in the North; more\r\n      like a Student than a Senator: not four-and-twenty yet; who has\r\n      written Books; a youth of slight stature, with mild mellow voice,\r\n      enthusiast olive-complexion, and long dark hair. Féraud, from the\r\n      far valley D’Aure in the folds of the Pyrenees, is coming; an\r\n      ardent Republican; doomed to fame, at least in death.\r\n\r\n      All manner of Patriot men are coming: Teachers, Husbandmen,\r\n      Priests and Ex-Priests, Traders, Doctors; above all, Talkers, or\r\n      the Attorney-species. Man-midwives, as Levasseur of the Sarthe,\r\n      are not wanting. Nor Artists: gross David, with the swoln cheek,\r\n      has long painted, with genius in a state of convulsion; and will\r\n      now legislate. The swoln cheek, choking his words in the birth,\r\n      totally disqualifies him as orator; but his pencil, his head, his\r\n      gross hot heart, with genius in a state of convulsion, will be\r\n      there. A man bodily and mentally swoln-cheeked, disproportionate;\r\n      flabby-large, instead of great; weak withal as in a state of\r\n      convulsion, not strong in a state of composure: so let him play\r\n      his part. Nor are naturalised Benefactors of the Species\r\n      forgotten: Priestley, elected by the Orne Department, but\r\n      declining: Paine the rebellious Needleman, by the Pas de Calais,\r\n      who accepts.\r\n\r\n      Few Nobles come, and yet not none. Paul François Barras, “noble\r\n      as the Barrases, old as the rocks of Provence;” he is one. The\r\n      reckless, shipwrecked man: flung ashore on the coast of the\r\n      Maldives long ago, while sailing and soldiering as Indian\r\n      Fighter; flung ashore since then, as hungry Parisian\r\n      Pleasure-hunter and Half-pay, on many a Circe Island, with\r\n      temporary enchantment, temporary conversion into beasthood and\r\n      hoghood;—the remote Var Department has now sent him hither. A man\r\n      of heat and haste; defective in utterance; defective indeed in\r\n      any thing to utter; yet not without a certain rapidity of glance,\r\n      a certain swift transient courage; who, in these times, Fortune\r\n      favouring, may go far. He is tall, handsome to the eye, “only the\r\n      complexion a little yellow;” but “with a robe of purple with a\r\n      scarlet cloak and plume of tricolor, on occasions of solemnity,”\r\n      the man will look well.[553] Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau,\r\n      Old-Constituent, is a kind of noble, and of enormous wealth; he\r\n      too has come hither:—to have the Pain of Death _abolished?_\r\n      Hapless Ex-Parlementeer! Nay, among our Sixty Old-Constituents,\r\n      see Philippe d’Orléans a Prince of the Blood! Not now\r\n      _D’Orléans:_ for, Feudalism being swept from the world, he\r\n      demands of his worthy friends the Electors of Paris, to have a\r\n      new name of their choosing; whereupon Procureur Manuel, like an\r\n      antithetic literary man, recommends _Equality_, Egalité. A\r\n      Philippe Egalité therefore will sit; seen of the Earth and\r\n      Heaven.\r\n\r\n      Such a Convention is gathering itself together. Mere angry\r\n      poultry in moulting season; whom Brunswick’s grenadiers and\r\n      cannoneers will give short account of. Would the weather only\r\n      mend a little![554]\r\n\r\n      In vain, O Bertrand! The weather will not mend a whit:—nay even\r\n      if it did? Dumouriez Polymetis, though Bertrand knows it not,\r\n      started from brief slumber at Sedan, on that morning of the 29th\r\n      of August; with stealthiness, with promptitude, audacity. Some\r\n      three mornings after that, Brunswick, opening wide eyes,\r\n      perceives the Passes of the Argonne all seized; blocked with\r\n      felled trees, fortified with camps; and that it is a most shifty\r\n      swift Dumouriez this, who has outwitted him!\r\n\r\n      The manœuvre may cost Brunswick “a loss of three weeks,” very\r\n      fatal in these circumstances. A Mountain-wall of forty miles\r\n      lying between him and Paris: which he should have\r\n      preoccupied;—which how now to get possession of? Also the rain it\r\n      raineth every day; and we are in a hungry Champagne Pouilleuse, a\r\n      land flowing only with ditch-water. How to cross this\r\n      Mountain-wall of the Argonne; or what in the world to do with\r\n      it?—there are marchings and wet splashings by steep paths, with\r\n      _sackerments_ and guttural interjections; forcings of Argonne\r\n      Passes,—which unhappily will not force. Through the woods,\r\n      volleying War reverberates, like huge gong-music, or Moloch’s\r\n      kettledrum, borne by the echoes; swoln torrents boil angrily\r\n      round the foot of rocks, floating pale carcasses of men. In vain!\r\n      Islettes Village, with its church-steeple, rises intact in the\r\n      Mountain-pass, between the embosoming heights; your forced\r\n      marchings and climbings have become forced slidings, and\r\n      tumblings back. From the hill-tops thou seest nothing but dumb\r\n      crags, and endless wet moaning woods; the Clermont _Vache_ (huge\r\n      Cow that she is) disclosing herself[555] at intervals; flinging\r\n      off her cloud-blanket, and soon taking it on again, drowned in\r\n      the pouring Heaven. The Argonne Passes will not force: you must\r\n      _skirt_ the Argonne; go round by the end of it.\r\n\r\n      But fancy whether the Emigrant Seigneurs have not got their\r\n      brilliancy dulled a little; whether that “Foot Regiment in\r\n      red-facings with nankeen trousers” could be in field-day order!\r\n      In place of gasconading, a sort of desperation, and hydrophobia\r\n      from _excess_ of water, is threatening to supervene. Young Prince\r\n      de Ligne, son of that brave literary De Ligne the Thundergod of\r\n      Dandies, fell backwards; shot dead in Grand-Pré, the Northmost of\r\n      the Passes: Brunswick is skirting and rounding, laboriously, by\r\n      the extremity of the South. Four days; days of a rain as of\r\n      Noah,—without fire, without food! For fire you cut down green\r\n      trees, and produce smoke; for food you eat green grapes, and\r\n      produce colic, pestilential dysentery, ὀλέκοντο δὲ λαοί. And the\r\n      Peasants assassinate us, they do not join us; shrill women cry\r\n      shame on us, threaten to draw their very scissors on us! O ye\r\n      hapless dulled-bright Seigneurs, and hydrophobic splashed\r\n      Nankeens;—but O, ten times more, ye poor _sackerment_ing\r\n      ghastly-visaged Hessians and Hulans, fallen on your backs; who\r\n      had no call to die there, except compulsion and three-halfpence\r\n      a-day! Nor has Mrs. Le Blanc of the Golden Arm a good time of it,\r\n      in her bower of dripping rushes. Assassinating Peasants are\r\n      hanged; Old-Constituent Honourable members, though of venerable\r\n      age, ride in carts with their hands tied; these are the woes of\r\n      war.\r\n\r\n      Thus they; sprawling and wriggling, far and wide, on the slopes\r\n      and passes of the Argonne;—a loss to Brunswick of five-and-twenty\r\n      disastrous days. There is wriggling and struggling; facing,\r\n      backing, and right-about facing; as the positions shift, and the\r\n      Argonne gets partly rounded, partly forced:—but still Dumouriez,\r\n      force him, round him as you will, sticks like a rooted fixture on\r\n      the ground; fixture with many _hinges;_ wheeling now this way,\r\n      now that; shewing always new front, in the most unexpected\r\n      manner: nowise consenting to take himself away. Recruits stream\r\n      up on him: full of heart; yet rather difficult to deal with.\r\n      Behind Grand-Pré, for example, Grand-Pré which is on the\r\n      wrong-side of the Argonne, for we are now forced and rounded,—the\r\n      full heart, in one of those wheelings and shewings of new front,\r\n      did as it were overset itself, as full hearts are liable to do;\r\n      and there rose a shriek of _sauve qui peut_, and a death-panic\r\n      which had nigh ruined all! So that the General had to come\r\n      galloping; and, with thunder-words, with gesture, stroke of drawn\r\n      sword even, check and rally, and bring back the sense of\r\n      shame;[556]—nay to seize the first shriekers and ringleaders;\r\n      “shave their heads and eyebrows,” and pack them forth into the\r\n      world as a sign. Thus too (for really the rations are short, and\r\n      wet camping with hungry stomach brings bad humour) there is like\r\n      to be mutiny. Whereupon again Dumouriez “arrives at the head of\r\n      their line, with his staff, and an escort of a hundred huzzars.\r\n      He had placed some squadrons behind them, the artillery in front;\r\n      he said to them: ‘As for you, for I will neither call you\r\n      citizens, nor soldiers, nor my men (_ni mes enfans_), you see\r\n      before you this artillery, behind you this cavalry. You have\r\n      dishonoured yourselves by crimes. If you amend, and grow to\r\n      behave like this brave Army which you have the honour of\r\n      belonging to, you will find in me a good father. But plunderers\r\n      and assassins I do not suffer here. At the smallest mutiny I will\r\n      have you shivered in pieces (_hacher en pièces_). Seek out the\r\n      scoundrels that are among you, and dismiss them yourselves; I\r\n      hold you responsible for them.’”[557]\r\n\r\n      Patience, O Dumouriez! This uncertain heap of shriekers,\r\n      mutineers, were they once drilled and inured, will become a\r\n      phalanxed mass of Fighters; and wheel and whirl, to order,\r\n      swiftly like the wind or the whirlwind: tanned mustachio-figures;\r\n      often barefoot, even bare-backed; with sinews of iron; who\r\n      require only bread and gunpowder: very Sons of Fire, the\r\n      adroitest, hastiest, hottest ever seen perhaps since Attila’s\r\n      time. They may conquer and overrun amazingly, much as that same\r\n      Attila did;—whose Attila’s-Camp and Battlefield thou now seest,\r\n      on this very ground;[558] who, after sweeping bare the world,\r\n      was, with difficulty, and days of tough fighting, checked _here_\r\n      by Roman Ætius and Fortune; and his dust-cloud made to vanish in\r\n      the East again!—\r\n\r\n      Strangely enough, in this shrieking Confusion of a Soldiery,\r\n      which we saw long since fallen all suicidally out of square in\r\n      suicidal collision,—at Nanci, or on the streets of Metz, where\r\n      brave Bouillé stood with drawn sword; and which has collided and\r\n      ground itself to pieces worse and worse ever since, down now to\r\n      such a state: in this shrieking Confusion, and not elsewhere,\r\n      lies the first germ of returning Order for France! Round which,\r\n      we say, poor France nearly all ground down suicidally likewise\r\n      into rubbish and Chaos, will be glad to rally; to begin growing,\r\n      and new-shaping her inorganic dust: very slowly, through\r\n      centuries, through Napoleons, Louis Philippes, and other the like\r\n      media and phases,—into a new, infinitely preferable France, we\r\n      can hope!—\r\n\r\n      These wheelings and movements in the region of the Argonne, which\r\n      are all faithfully described by Dumouriez himself, and more\r\n      interesting to us than Hoyle’s or Philidor’s best Game of Chess,\r\n      let us, nevertheless, O Reader, entirely omit;—and hasten to\r\n      remark two things: the first a minute private, the second a large\r\n      public thing. Our minute private thing is: the presence, in the\r\n      Prussian host, in that war-game of the Argonne, of a certain Man,\r\n      belonging to the sort called Immortal; who, in days since then,\r\n      is becoming visible more and more, in that character, as the\r\n      Transitory more and more vanishes; for from of old it was\r\n      remarked that when the Gods appear among men, it is seldom in\r\n      recognisable shape; thus Admetus“ neatherds give Apollo a draught\r\n      of their goatskin whey-bottle (well if they do not give him\r\n      strokes with their ox-rungs), not dreaming that he is the Sungod!\r\n      This man’s name is _Johann Wolfgang von Goethe_. He is Herzog\r\n      Weimar’s Minister, come with the small contingent of Weimar; to\r\n      do insignificant unmilitary duty here; very irrecognizable to\r\n      nearly all! He stands at present, with drawn bridle, on the\r\n      height near Saint-Menehould, making an experiment on the\r\n      “cannon-fever;” having ridden thither against persuasion, into\r\n      the dance and firing of the cannon-balls, with a scientific\r\n      desire to understand what that same cannon-fever may be: “The\r\n      sound of them,” says he, “is curious enough; as if it were\r\n      compounded of the humming of tops, the gurgling of water and the\r\n      whistle of birds. By degrees you get a very uncommon sensation;\r\n      which can only be described by similitude. It seems as if you\r\n      were in some place extremely hot, and at the same time were\r\n      completely penetrated by the heat of it; so that you feel as if\r\n      you and this element you are in were perfectly on a par. The\r\n      eyesight loses nothing of its strength or distinctness; and yet\r\n      it is as if all things had got a kind of brown-red colour, which\r\n      makes the situation and the objects still more impressive on\r\n      you.”[559]\r\n\r\n      This is the cannon-fever, as a World-Poet feels it.—A man\r\n      entirely irrecognisable! In whose irrecognisable head, meanwhile,\r\n      there verily is the spiritual counterpart (and call it\r\n      complement) of this same huge Death-Birth of the World; which now\r\n      effectuates itself, outwardly in the Argonne, in such\r\n      cannon-thunder; inwardly, in the irrecognisable head, quite\r\n      otherwise than by thunder! Mark that man, O Reader, as the\r\n      memorablest of all the memorable in this Argonne Campaign. What\r\n      we say of him is not dream, nor flourish of rhetoric; but\r\n      scientific historic fact; as many men, now at this distance, see\r\n      or begin to see.\r\n\r\n      But the large public thing we had to remark is this: That the\r\n      Twentieth of September, 1792, was a raw morning covered with\r\n      mist; that from three in the morning Sainte-Menehould, and those\r\n      Villages and homesteads we know of old were stirred by the rumble\r\n      of artillery-wagons, by the clatter of hoofs, and many footed\r\n      tramp of men: all manner of military, Patriot and Prussian,\r\n      taking up positions, on the Heights of La Lune and other Heights;\r\n      shifting and shoving,—seemingly in some dread chess-game; which\r\n      may the Heavens turn to good! The Miller of Valmy has fled dusty\r\n      under ground; his Mill, were it never so windy, will have rest\r\n      today. At seven in the morning the mist clears off: see\r\n      Kellermann, Dumouriez’ second in command, with “eighteen pieces\r\n      of cannon,” and deep-serried ranks, drawn up round that same\r\n      silent Windmill, on his knoll of strength; Brunswick, also, with\r\n      serried ranks and cannon, glooming over to him from the height of\r\n      La Lune; only the little brook and its little dell now parting\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      So that the much-longed-for has come at last! Instead of hunger\r\n      and dysentery, we shall have sharp shot; and then!—Dumouriez,\r\n      with force and firm front, looks on from a neighbouring height;\r\n      can help only with his wishes, in silence. Lo, the eighteen\r\n      pieces do bluster and bark, responsive to the bluster of La Lune;\r\n      and thunder-clouds mount into the air; and echoes roar through\r\n      all dells, far into the depths of Argonne Wood (deserted now);\r\n      and limbs and lives of men fly dissipated, this way and that. Can\r\n      Brunswick make an impression on them? The dull-bright Seigneurs\r\n      stand biting their thumbs: these Sansculottes seem not to fly\r\n      like poultry! Towards noontide a cannon-shot blows Kellermann’s\r\n      horse from under him; there bursts a powder-cart high into the\r\n      air, with knell heard over all: some swagging and swaying\r\n      observable;—Brunswick will try! ‘_Camarades_,’ cries Kellermann,\r\n      ‘_Vive la Patrie! Allons vaincre pour elle_, Let us conquer.’\r\n      ‘Live the Fatherland!’ rings responsive, to the welkin, like\r\n      rolling-fire from side to side: our ranks are as firm as rocks;\r\n      and Brunswick may _re_cross the dell, ineffectual; regain his old\r\n      position on La Lune; not unbattered by the way. And so, for the\r\n      length of a September day,—with bluster and bark; with bellow far\r\n      echoing! The cannonade lasts till sunset; and no impression made.\r\n      Till an hour after sunset, the few remaining Clocks of the\r\n      District striking Seven; at this late time of day Brunswick tries\r\n      again. With not a whit better fortune! He is met by rock-ranks,\r\n      by shouts of _Vive la Patrie;_ and driven back, not unbattered.\r\n      Whereupon he ceases; retires “to the Tavern of La Lune;” and sets\r\n      to raising a redoute lest _he_ be attacked!\r\n\r\n      Verily so: ye dulled-bright Seigneurs, make of it what ye may.\r\n      Ah, and France does not rise round us in mass; and the Peasants\r\n      do not join us, but assassinate us: neither hanging nor any\r\n      persuasion will induce them! They have lost their old\r\n      distinguishing love of King, and King’s-cloak,—I fear,\r\n      altogether; and will even fight to be rid of it: that seems now\r\n      their humour. Nor does Austria prosper, nor the siege of\r\n      Thionville. The Thionvillers, carrying their insolence to the\r\n      epigrammatic pitch, have put a Wooden Horse on their walls, with\r\n      a bundle of hay hung from him, and this Inscription: “When I\r\n      finish my hay, you will take Thionville.”[560] To such height has\r\n      the frenzy of mankind risen.\r\n\r\n      The trenches of Thionville may shut: and what though those of\r\n      Lille open? The Earth smiles not on us, nor the Heaven; but weeps\r\n      and blears itself, in sour rain, and worse. Our very friends\r\n      insult us; we are wounded in the house of our friends: ‘His\r\n      Majesty of Prussia had a greatcoat, when the rain came; and\r\n      (contrary to all known laws) he put it on, though our two French\r\n      Princes, the hope of their country, had none!’ To which indeed,\r\n      as Goethe admits, what answer could be made?[561]—Cold and Hunger\r\n      and Affront, Colic and Dysentery and Death; and we here, cowering\r\n      _redouted_, most unredoubtable, amid the “tattered corn-shocks\r\n      and deformed stubble,” on the splashy Height of La Lune, round\r\n      the mean Tavern de La Lune!—\r\n\r\n      This is the Cannonade of Valmy; wherein the World-Poet\r\n      experimented on the cannon-fever; wherein the French Sansculottes\r\n      did not fly like poultry. Precious to France! Every soldier did\r\n      his duty, and Alsatian Kellermann (how preferable to old Lückner\r\n      the dismissed!) began to become greater; and _Égalité Fils_,\r\n      Equality Junior, a light gallant Field-Officer, distinguished\r\n      himself by intrepidity:—it is the same intrepid individual who\r\n      now, as Louis-Philippe, without the Equality, struggles, under\r\n      sad circumstances, to be called King of the French for a season.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.1.VIII.\r\n      Exeunt.\r\n\r\n      But this Twentieth of September is otherwise a great day. For,\r\n      observe, while Kellermann’s horse was flying blown from under him\r\n      at the Mill of Valmy, our new National Deputies, that shall be a\r\n      NATIONAL CONVENTION, are hovering and gathering about the Hall of\r\n      the Hundred Swiss; with intent to constitute themselves!\r\n\r\n      On the morrow, about noontide, Camus the Archivist is busy\r\n      “verifying their powers;” several hundreds of them already here.\r\n      Whereupon the Old Legislative comes solemnly over, to merge its\r\n      old ashes phœnix-like in the body of the new;—and so forthwith,\r\n      returning all solemnly back to the Salle de Manége, there sits a\r\n      National Convention, Seven Hundred and Forty-nine complete, or\r\n      complete enough; presided by Pétion;—which proceeds directly to\r\n      do business. Read that reported afternoon’s-debate, O Reader;\r\n      there are few debates like it: dull reporting _Moniteur_ itself\r\n      becomes more dramatic than a very Shakespeare. For epigrammatic\r\n      Manuel rises, speaks strange things; how the President shall have\r\n      a guard of honour, and lodge in the Tuileries:—_rejected_. And\r\n      Danton rises and speaks; and Collot d’Herbois rises, and Curate\r\n      Gregoire, and lame Couthon of the Mountain rises; and in rapid\r\n      Melibœan stanzas, only a few lines each, they propose motions not\r\n      a few: That the corner-stone of our new Constitution is\r\n      Sovereignty of the People; that our Constitution shall be\r\n      accepted by the People or be null; further that the People ought\r\n      to be avenged, and have right Judges; that the Imposts must\r\n      continue till new order; that Landed and other Property be sacred\r\n      forever; finally that “Royalty from this day is abolished in\r\n      France:”—_Decreed_ all, before four o’clock strike, with\r\n      acclamation of the world![562] The tree was all so ripe; only\r\n      shake it and there fall such yellow cart-loads.\r\n\r\n      And so over in the Valmy Region, as soon as the news come, what\r\n      stir is this, audible, visible from our muddy heights of La\r\n      Lune?[563] Universal shouting of the French on their opposite\r\n      hillside; caps raised on bayonets; and a sound as of _République;\r\n      Vive la République_ borne dubious on the winds!—On the morrow\r\n      morning, so to speak, Brunswick slings his knapsacks before day,\r\n      lights any fires he has; and marches without tap of drum.\r\n      Dumouriez finds ghastly symptoms in that camp; “_latrines_ full\r\n      of blood!”[564] The chivalrous King of Prussia, for he as we saw\r\n      is here in person, may long rue the day; may look colder than\r\n      ever on these dulled-bright Seigneurs, and French Princes their\r\n      Country’s hope;—and, on the whole, put on his great-coat without\r\n      ceremony, happy that he has one. They retire, all retire with\r\n      convenient despatch, through a Champagne trodden into a quagmire,\r\n      the wild weather pouring on them; Dumouriez through his\r\n      Kellermanns and Dillons pricking them a little in the hinder\r\n      parts. A little, not much; now pricking, now negotiating: for\r\n      Brunswick has his eyes opened; and the Majesty of Prussia is a\r\n      repentant Majesty.\r\n\r\n      Nor has Austria prospered, nor the Wooden Horse of Thionville\r\n      bitten his hay; nor Lille City surrendered itself. The Lille\r\n      trenches opened, on the 29th of the month; with balls and shells,\r\n      and redhot balls; as if not trenches but Vesuvius and the Pit had\r\n      opened. It was frightful, say all eye-witnesses; but it is\r\n      ineffectual. The Lillers have risen to such temper; especially\r\n      after these news from Argonne and the East. Not a\r\n      Sans-indispensables in Lille that would surrender for a King’s\r\n      ransom. Redhot balls rain, day and night; “six-thousand,” or so,\r\n      and bombs “filled internally with oil of turpentine which\r\n      splashes up in flame;”—mainly on the dwellings of the\r\n      Sansculottes and Poor; the streets of the Rich being spared. But\r\n      the Sansculottes get water-pails; form quenching-regulations,\r\n      ‘The ball is in Peter’s house!’ ‘The ball is in John’s!’ They\r\n      divide their lodging and substance with each other; shout _Vive\r\n      la République_; and faint not in heart. A ball thunders through\r\n      the main chamber of the Hôtel-de-Ville, while the Commune is\r\n      there assembled: ‘We are in permanence,’ says one, coldly,\r\n      proceeding with his business; and the ball remains permanent too,\r\n      sticking in the wall, probably to this day.[565]\r\n\r\n      The Austrian Archduchess (Queen’s Sister) will herself see red\r\n      artillery fired; in their over-haste to satisfy an Archduchess\r\n      “two mortars explode and kill thirty persons.” It is in vain;\r\n      Lille, often burning, is always quenched again; Lille will not\r\n      yield. The very boys deftly wrench the matches out of fallen\r\n      bombs: “a man clutches a rolling ball with his hat, which takes\r\n      fire; when cool, they crown it with a _bonnet rouge_.” Memorable\r\n      also be that nimble Barber, who when the bomb burst beside him,\r\n      snatched up a shred of it, introduced soap and lather into it,\r\n      crying, ‘_Voilà mon plat à barbe_, My new shaving-dish!’ and\r\n      shaved “fourteen people” on the spot. Bravo, thou nimble Shaver;\r\n      worthy to shave old spectral Redcloak, and find treasures!—On the\r\n      eighth day of this desperate siege, the sixth day of October,\r\n      Austria finding it fruitless, draws off, with no pleasurable\r\n      consciousness; rapidly, Dumouriez tending thitherward; and Lille\r\n      too, black with ashes and smoulder, but jubilant skyhigh, flings\r\n      its gates open. The _Plat à barbe_ became fashionable; “no\r\n      Patriot of an elegant turn,” says Mercier several years\r\n      afterwards, “but shaves himself out of the splinter of a Lille\r\n      bomb.”\r\n\r\n      _Quid multa_, Why many words? The Invaders are in flight;\r\n      Brunswick’s Host, the third part of it gone to death, staggers\r\n      disastrous along the deep highways of Champagne; spreading out\r\n      also into “the fields, of a tough spongy red-coloured clay;—like\r\n      Pharaoh through a Red Sea of mud,” says Goethe; “for he also lay\r\n      broken chariots, and riders and foot seemed sinking around.”[566]\r\n      On the eleventh morning of October, the World-Poet, struggling\r\n      Northwards out of Verdun, which he had entered Southwards, some\r\n      five weeks ago, in quite other order, discerned the following\r\n      Phenomenon and formed part of it:\r\n\r\n      “Towards three in the morning, without having had any sleep, we\r\n      were about mounting our carriage, drawn up at the door; when an\r\n      insuperable obstacle disclosed itself: for there rolled on\r\n      already, between the pavement-stones which were crushed up into a\r\n      ridge on each side, an uninterrupted column of sick-wagons\r\n      through the Town, and all was trodden as into a morass. While we\r\n      stood waiting what could be made of it, our Landlord the Knight\r\n      of Saint-Louis pressed past us, without salutation.” He had been\r\n      a Calonne’s Notable in 1787, an Emigrant since; had returned to\r\n      his home, jubilant, with the Prussians; but must now forth again\r\n      into the wide world, “followed by a servant carrying a little\r\n      bundle on his stick.\r\n\r\n      “The activity of our alert Lisieux shone eminent; and, on this\r\n      occasion too, brought us on: for he struck into a small gap of\r\n      the wagon-row; and held the advancing team back till we, with our\r\n      six and our four horses, got intercalated; after which, in my\r\n      light little coachlet, I could breathe freer. We were now under\r\n      way; at a funeral pace, but still under way. The day broke; we\r\n      found ourselves at the outlet of the Town, in a tumult and\r\n      turmoil without measure. All sorts of vehicles, few horsemen,\r\n      innumerable foot-people, were crossing each other on the great\r\n      esplanade before the Gate. We turned to the right, with our\r\n      Column, towards Estain, on a limited highway, with ditches at\r\n      each side. Self-preservation, in so monstrous a press, knew now\r\n      no pity, no respect of aught. Not far before us there fell down a\r\n      horse of an ammunition-wagon: they cut the traces, and let it\r\n      lie. And now as the three others could not bring their load\r\n      along, they cut them also loose, tumbled the heavy-packed vehicle\r\n      into the ditch; and, with the smallest retardation, we had to\r\n      drive on, right over the horse, which was just about to rise; and\r\n      I saw too clearly how its legs, under the wheels, went crashing\r\n      and quivering.\r\n\r\n      “Horse and foot endeavoured to escape from the narrow laborious\r\n      highway into the meadows: but these too were rained to ruin;\r\n      overflowed by full ditches, the connexion of the footpaths every\r\n      where interrupted. Four gentlemanlike, handsome, well-dressed\r\n      French soldiers waded for a time beside our carriage; wonderfully\r\n      clean and neat: and had such art of picking their steps, that\r\n      their foot-gear testified no higher than the ancle to the muddy\r\n      pilgrimage these good people found themselves engaged in.\r\n\r\n      “That under such circumstances one saw, in ditches, in meadows,\r\n      in fields and crofts, dead horses enough, was natural to the\r\n      case: by and by, however, you found them also flayed, the fleshy\r\n      parts even cut away; sad token of the universal distress.\r\n\r\n      “Thus we fared on; every moment in danger, at the smallest\r\n      stoppage on our own part, of being ourselves tumbled overboard;\r\n      under which circumstances, truly, the careful dexterity of our\r\n      Lisieux could not be sufficiently praised. The same talent shewed\r\n      itself at Estain; where we arrived towards noon; and descried,\r\n      over the beautiful well-built little Town, through streets and on\r\n      squares, around and beside us, one sense-confusing tumult: the\r\n      mass rolled this way and that; and, all struggling forward, each\r\n      hindered the other. Unexpectedly our carriage drew up before a\r\n      stately house in the market-place; master and mistress of the\r\n      mansion saluted us in reverent distance.” Dexterous Lisieux,\r\n      though we knew it not, had said we were the King of Prussia’s\r\n      Brother!\r\n\r\n      “But now, from the ground-floor windows, looking over the whole\r\n      market-place, we had the endless tumult lying, as it were,\r\n      palpable. All sorts of walkers, soldiers in uniform, marauders,\r\n      stout but sorrowing citizens and peasants, women and children,\r\n      crushed and jostled each other, amid vehicles of all forms:\r\n      ammunition-wagons, baggage-wagons; carriages, single, double, and\r\n      multiplex; such hundredfold miscellany of teams, requisitioned or\r\n      lawfully owned, making way, hitting together, hindering each\r\n      other, rolled here to right and to left. Horned-cattle too were\r\n      struggling on; probably herds that had been put in requisition.\r\n      Riders you saw few; but the elegant carriages of the Emigrants,\r\n      many-coloured, lackered, gilt and silvered, evidently by the best\r\n      builders, caught your eye.[567]\r\n\r\n      “The crisis of the strait however arose further on a little;\r\n      where the crowded market-place had to introduce itself into a\r\n      street,—straight indeed and good, but proportionably far too\r\n      narrow. I have, in my life, seen nothing like it: the aspect of\r\n      it might perhaps be compared to that of a swoln river which has\r\n      been raging over meadows and fields, and is now again obliged to\r\n      press itself through a narrow bridge, and flow on in its bounded\r\n      channel. Down the long street, all visible from our windows,\r\n      there swelled continually the strangest tide: a high\r\n      double-seated travelling-coach towered visible over the flood of\r\n      things. We thought of the fair Frenchwomen we had seen in the\r\n      morning. It was not they, however, it was Count Haugwitz; him you\r\n      could look at, with a kind of sardonic malice, rocking onwards,\r\n      step by step, there.”[568]\r\n\r\n      In such untriumphant Procession has the Brunswick Manifesto\r\n      issued! Nay in worse, “in Negotiation with these miscreants,”—the\r\n      first news of which produced such a revulsion in the Emigrant\r\n      nature, as put our scientific World-Poet “in fear for the wits of\r\n      several.”[569] There is no help: they must fare on, these poor\r\n      Emigrants, angry with all persons and things, and making all\r\n      persons angry, in the hapless course they struck into. Landlord\r\n      and landlady testify to you, at _tables-d’hôte_, how\r\n      insupportable these Frenchmen are: how, in spite of such\r\n      humiliation, of poverty and probable beggary, there is ever the\r\n      same struggle for precedence, the same forwardness, and want of\r\n      discretion. High in honour, at the head of the table, you with\r\n      your own eyes observe not a Seigneur but the automaton of a\r\n      Seigneur, fallen into dotage; still worshipped, reverently waited\r\n      on, and fed. In miscellaneous seats, is a miscellany of soldiers,\r\n      commissaries, adventurers; consuming silently their barbarian\r\n      victuals. “On all brows is to be read a hard destiny; all are\r\n      silent, for each has his own sufferings to bear, and looks forth\r\n      into misery without bounds.” One hasty wanderer, coming in, and\r\n      eating without ungraciousness what is set before him, the\r\n      landlord lets off almost scot-free. ‘He is,’ whispered the\r\n      landlord to me, ‘the first of these cursed people I have seen\r\n      condescend to taste our German black bread.’[570]\r\n\r\n      And Dumouriez is in Paris; lauded and feasted; paraded in\r\n      glittering saloons, floods of beautifullest blond-dresses and\r\n      broadcloth-coats flowing past him, endless, in admiring joy. One\r\n      night, nevertheless, in the splendour of one such scene, he sees\r\n      himself suddenly apostrophised by a squalid unjoyful Figure, who\r\n      has come in _un_invited, nay despite of all lackeys; an unjoyful\r\n      Figure! The Figure is come ‘in express mission from the\r\n      Jacobins,’ to inquire sharply, better then than later, touching\r\n      certain things: ‘Shaven eyebrows of Volunteer Patriots, for\r\n      instance?’ Also ‘your threats of shivering in pieces?’ Also, ‘why\r\n      you have not chased Brunswick hotly enough?’ Thus, with sharp\r\n      croak, inquires the Figure.—‘_Ah, c’est vous qu’on appelle\r\n      Marat_, You are he they call Marat!’ answers the General, and\r\n      turns coldly on his heel.[571]—‘Marat!’ The blonde-gowns quiver\r\n      like aspens; the dress-coats gather round; Actor Talma (for it is\r\n      his house), and almost the very chandelier-lights, are blue: till\r\n      this obscene Spectrum, or visual Appearance, vanish back into\r\n      native Night.\r\n\r\n      General Dumouriez, in few brief days, is gone again, towards the\r\n      Netherlands; will attack the Netherlands, winter though it be.\r\n      And General Montesquiou, on the South-East, has driven in the\r\n      Sardinian Majesty; nay, almost without a shot fired, has taken\r\n      Savoy from him, which longs to become a piece of the Republic.\r\n      And General Custine, on the North-East, has dashed forth on\r\n      Spires and its Arsenal; and then on Electoral Mentz, not\r\n      uninvited, wherein are German Democrats and no shadow of an\r\n      Elector now:—so that in the last days of October, Frau Forster, a\r\n      daughter of Heyne’s, somewhat democratic, walking out of the Gate\r\n      of Mentz with her Husband, finds French Soldiers playing at bowls\r\n      with cannon-balls there. Forster trips cheerfully over one iron\r\n      bomb, with ‘Live the Republic!’ A black-bearded National Guard\r\n      answers: ‘_Elle vivra bien sans vous_, It will probably live\r\n      independently of you!’[572]\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 3.II.\r\n      REGICIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.I.\r\n      The Deliberative.\r\n\r\n      France therefore has done two things very completely: she has\r\n      hurled back her Cimmerian Invaders far over the marches; and\r\n      likewise she has shattered her own internal Social Constitution,\r\n      even to the minutest fibre of it, into wreck and dissolution.\r\n      Utterly it is all altered: from King down to Parish Constable,\r\n      all Authorities, Magistrates, Judges, persons that bore rule,\r\n      have had, on the sudden, to alter themselves, so far as needful;\r\n      or else, on the sudden, and not without violence, to be altered:\r\n      a Patriot “Executive Council of Ministers,” with a Patriot Danton\r\n      in it, and then a whole Nation and National Convention, have\r\n      taken care of that. Not a Parish Constable, in the furthest\r\n      hamlet, who has said _De Par le Roi_, and shewn loyalty, but must\r\n      retire, making way for a new improved Parish Constable who can\r\n      say _De par la République._\r\n\r\n      It is a change such as History must beg her readers to imagine,\r\n      _un_described. An instantaneous change of the whole body-politic,\r\n      the soul-politic being all changed; such a change as few bodies,\r\n      politic or other, can experience in this world. Say perhaps, such\r\n      as poor Nymph Semele’s body did experience, when she would needs,\r\n      with woman’s humour, see her Olympian Jove as very Jove;—and so\r\n      stood, poor Nymph, this moment Semele, next moment not Semele,\r\n      but Flame and a Statue of red-hot Ashes! France has looked upon\r\n      Democracy; seen it face to face.—The Cimmerian Invaders will\r\n      rally, in humbler temper, with better or worse luck: the wreck\r\n      and dissolution must reshape itself into a social Arrangement as\r\n      it can and may. But as for this National Convention, which is to\r\n      settle every thing, if it do, as Deputy Paine and France\r\n      generally expects, get all finished “in a few months,” we shall\r\n      call it a most deft Convention.\r\n\r\n      In truth, it is very singular to see how this mercurial French\r\n      People plunges suddenly from _Vive le Roi_ to _Vive la\r\n      République;_ and goes simmering and dancing; shaking off daily\r\n      (so to speak), and trampling into the dust, its old social\r\n      garnitures, ways of thinking, rules of existing; and cheerfully\r\n      dances towards the Ruleless, Unknown, with such hope in its\r\n      heart, and nothing but _Freedom, Equality and Brotherhood_ in its\r\n      mouth. Is it two centuries, or is it only two years, since all\r\n      France roared simultaneously to the welkin, bursting forth into\r\n      sound and smoke at its _Feast of Pikes_, ‘Live the Restorer of\r\n      French Liberty?’ Three short years ago there was still Versailles\r\n      and an Œil-de-Bœuf: now there is that watched Circuit of the\r\n      Temple, girt with dragon-eyed Municipals, where, as in its final\r\n      limbo, Royalty lies extinct. In the year 1789, Constituent Deputy\r\n      Barrère “wept,” in his _Break-of-Day_ Newspaper, at sight of a\r\n      reconciled King Louis; and now in 1792, Convention Deputy\r\n      Barrère, perfectly tearless, may be considering, whether the\r\n      reconciled King Louis shall be guillotined or not.\r\n\r\n      Old garnitures and social vestures drop off (we say) so fast,\r\n      being indeed quite decayed, and are trodden under the National\r\n      dance. And the new vestures, where are they; the new modes and\r\n      rules? Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: not vestures but the wish\r\n      for vestures! The Nation is for the present, figuratively\r\n      speaking, _naked!_ It has no rule or vesture; but is naked,—a\r\n      Sansculottic Nation.\r\n\r\n      So far, therefore, in such manner have our Patriot Brissots,\r\n      Guadets triumphed. Vergniaud’s Ezekiel-visions of the fall of\r\n      thrones and crowns, which he spake hypothetically and\r\n      prophetically in the Spring of the year, have suddenly come to\r\n      fulfilment in the Autumn. Our eloquent Patriots of the\r\n      Legislative, like strong Conjurors, by the word of their mouth,\r\n      have swept Royalism with its old modes and formulas to the winds;\r\n      and shall now govern a France free of formulas. Free of formulas!\r\n      And yet man lives not except with formulas; with customs, _ways_\r\n      of doing and living: no text truer than this; which will hold\r\n      true from the Tea-table and Tailor’s shopboard up to the High\r\n      Senate-houses, Solemn Temples; nay through all provinces of Mind\r\n      and Imagination, onwards to the outmost confines of articulate\r\n      Being,—_Ubi homines sunt modi sunt._ There are modes wherever\r\n      there are men. It is the deepest law of man’s nature; whereby man\r\n      is a craftsman and “tool-using animal;” not the slave of Impulse,\r\n      Chance, and Brute Nature, but in some measure their lord.\r\n      Twenty-five millions of men, suddenly stript bare of their\r\n      _modi_, and dancing them down in that manner, are a terrible\r\n      thing to govern!\r\n\r\n      Eloquent Patriots of the Legislative, meanwhile, have precisely\r\n      this problem to solve. Under the name and nickname of “statesmen,\r\n      _hommes d’état_,” of “moderate-men, _modérantins_,” of\r\n      Brissotins, Rolandins, finally of _Girondins_, they shall become\r\n      world-famous in solving it. For the Twenty-five millions are\r\n      Gallic effervescent too;—filled both with hope of the\r\n      unutterable, of universal Fraternity and Golden Age; and with\r\n      terror of the unutterable, Cimmerian Europe all rallying on us.\r\n      It is a problem like few. Truly, if man, as the Philosophers\r\n      brag, did to any extent look before and after, what, one may ask,\r\n      in many cases would become of him? What, in this case, would\r\n      become of these Seven Hundred and Forty-nine men? The Convention,\r\n      seeing clearly before and after, were a paralysed Convention.\r\n      Seeing clearly to the length of its own nose, it is not\r\n      paralysed.\r\n\r\n      To the Convention itself neither the work nor the method of doing\r\n      it is doubtful: To make the Constitution; to defend the Republic\r\n      till that be made. Speedily enough, accordingly, there has been a\r\n      “Committee of the Constitution” got together. Sieyes,\r\n      Old-Constituent, Constitution-builder by trade; Condorcet, fit\r\n      for better things; Deputy Paine, foreign Benefactor of the\r\n      Species, with that “red carbuncled face, and the black beaming\r\n      eyes;” Hérault de Séchelles, Ex-Parlementeer, one of the\r\n      handsomest men in France: these, with inferior guild-brethren,\r\n      are girt cheerfully to the work; will once more “make the\r\n      Constitution;” let us hope, more effectually than last time. For\r\n      that the Constitution can be made, who doubts,—unless the Gospel\r\n      of Jean Jacques came into the world in vain? True, our last\r\n      Constitution did tumble within the year, so lamentably. But what\r\n      then, except sort the rubbish and boulders, and build them up\r\n      again better? “Widen your basis,” for one thing,—to Universal\r\n      Suffrage, if need be; exclude rotten materials, Royalism and such\r\n      like, for another thing. And in brief, _build_, O unspeakable\r\n      Sieyes and Company, unwearied! Frequent perilous downrushing of\r\n      scaffolding and rubble-work, be that an irritation, no\r\n      discouragement. Start ye always again, clearing aside the wreck;\r\n      if with broken limbs, yet with whole hearts; and build, we say,\r\n      in the name of Heaven,—till either the work do stand; or else\r\n      mankind abandon it, and the Constitution-builders be paid off,\r\n      with laughter and tears! One good time, in the course of\r\n      Eternity, it was appointed that this of Social Contract too\r\n      should try itself out. And so the Committee of Constitution shall\r\n      toil: with hope and faith;—with no disturbance from any reader of\r\n      these pages.\r\n\r\n      To make the Constitution, then, and return home joyfully in a few\r\n      months: this is the prophecy our National Convention gives of\r\n      itself; by this scientific program shall its operations and\r\n      events go on. But from the best scientific program, in such a\r\n      case, to the actual fulfilment, what a difference! Every reunion\r\n      of men, is it not, as we often say, a reunion of incalculable\r\n      Influences; every unit of it a microcosm of Influences;—of which\r\n      how shall Science calculate or prophesy! Science, which cannot,\r\n      with all its calculuses, differential, integral, and of\r\n      variations, calculate the Problem of Three gravitating Bodies,\r\n      ought to hold her peace here, and say only: In this National\r\n      Convention there are Seven Hundred and Forty-nine very singular\r\n      Bodies, that gravitate and do much else;—who, probably in an\r\n      amazing manner, will work the appointment of Heaven.\r\n\r\n      Of National Assemblages, Parliaments, Congresses, which have long\r\n      sat; which are of saturnine temperament; above all, which are not\r\n      “dreadfully in earnest,” something may be computed or\r\n      conjectured: yet even these are a kind of Mystery in\r\n      progress,—whereby we see the Journalist Reporter find livelihood:\r\n      even these jolt madly out of the ruts, from time to time. How\r\n      much more a poor National Convention, of French vehemence; urged\r\n      on at such velocity; without routine, without rut, track or\r\n      landmark; and dreadfully in earnest every man of them! It is a\r\n      Parliament literally such as there was never elsewhere in the\r\n      world. Themselves are new, unarranged; they are the Heart and\r\n      presiding centre of a France fallen wholly into maddest\r\n      disarrangement. From all cities, hamlets, from the utmost ends of\r\n      this France with its Twenty-five million vehement souls,\r\n      thick-streaming influences storm in on that same Heart, in the\r\n      Salle de Manége, and storm out again: such fiery venous-arterial\r\n      circulation is the function of that Heart. Seven Hundred and\r\n      Forty-nine human individuals, we say, never sat together on\r\n      Earth, under more original circumstances. Common individuals most\r\n      of them, or not far from common; yet in virtue of the position\r\n      they occupied, so notable. How, in this wild piping of the\r\n      whirlwind of human passions, with death, victory, terror, valour,\r\n      and all height and all depth pealing and piping, these men, left\r\n      to their own guidance, will speak and act?\r\n\r\n      Readers know well that this French National Convention (quite\r\n      contrary to its own Program) became the astonishment and horror\r\n      of mankind; a kind of Apocalyptic Convention, or black _Dream\r\n      become real;_ concerning which History seldom speaks except in\r\n      the way of interjection: how it covered France with woe,\r\n      delusion, and delirium; and from its bosom there went forth Death\r\n      on the pale Horse. To hate this poor National Convention is easy;\r\n      to praise and love it has not been found impossible. It is, as we\r\n      say, a Parliament in the most original circumstances. To us, in\r\n      these pages, be it as a fuliginous fiery mystery, where Upper has\r\n      met Nether, and in such alternate glare and blackness of darkness\r\n      poor bedazzled mortals know not which is Upper, which is Nether;\r\n      but rage and plunge distractedly, as mortals, in that case, will\r\n      do. A Convention which has to consume itself, suicidally; and\r\n      become dead ashes—with its World! Behoves us, not to enter\r\n      exploratively its dim embroiled deeps; yet to stand with\r\n      unwavering eyes, looking how it welters; what notable phases and\r\n      occurrences it will successively throw up.\r\n\r\n      One general superficial circumstance we remark with praise: the\r\n      force of Politeness. To such depth has the sense of civilisation\r\n      penetrated man’s life; no Drouet, no Legendre, in the maddest tug\r\n      of war, can altogether shake it off. Debates of Senates\r\n      dreadfully in earnest are seldom given frankly to the world; else\r\n      perhaps they would surprise it. Did not the Grand Monarque\r\n      himself once chase his Louvois with a pair of brandished tongs?\r\n      But reading long volumes of these Convention Debates, all in a\r\n      foam with furious earnestness, earnest many times to the extent\r\n      of life and death, one is struck rather with the degree of\r\n      continence they manifest in speech; and how in such wild\r\n      ebullition, there is still a kind of polite rule struggling for\r\n      mastery, and the forms of social life never altogether disappear.\r\n      These men, though they menace with clenched right-hands, do not\r\n      clench one another by the collar; they draw no daggers, except\r\n      for oratorical purposes, and this not often: profane swearing is\r\n      almost unknown, though the Reports are frank enough; we find only\r\n      one or two oaths, oaths by Marat, reported in all.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, that there is “effervescence” who doubts?\r\n      Effervescence enough; Decrees passed by acclamation today,\r\n      repealed by vociferation tomorrow; temper fitful, most rotatory\r\n      changeful, always headlong! The “voice of the orator is covered\r\n      with rumours;” a hundred “honourable Members rush with menaces\r\n      towards the Left side of the Hall;” President has “broken three\r\n      bells in succession,”—claps on his hat, as signal that the\r\n      country is near ruined. A fiercely effervescent Old-Gallic\r\n      Assemblage!—Ah, how the loud sick sounds of Debate, and of Life,\r\n      which is a _debate_, sink silent one after another: so loud now,\r\n      and in a little while so low! Brennus, and those antique Gael\r\n      Captains, in their way to Rome, to Galatia, and such places,\r\n      whither they were in the habit of marching in the most fiery\r\n      manner, had Debates as effervescent, doubt it not; though no\r\n      _Moniteur_ has reported them. They scolded in Celtic Welsh, those\r\n      Brennuses; neither were they Sansculotte; nay rather breeches\r\n      (_braccæ_, say of felt or rough-leather) were the only thing they\r\n      had; being, as Livy testifies, naked down _to_ the haunches:—and,\r\n      see, it is the same sort of work and of men still, now when they\r\n      have got coats, and speak nasally a kind of broken Latin! But on\r\n      the whole does not TIME envelop this present National Convention;\r\n      as it did those Brennuses, and ancient August Senates in felt\r\n      breeches? Time surely; and also Eternity. Dim dusk of Time,—or\r\n      noon which will be dusk; and then there is night, and silence;\r\n      and Time with all its sick noises is swallowed in the still sea.\r\n      Pity thy brother, O Son of Adam! The angriest frothy jargon that\r\n      he utters, is it not properly the whimpering of an infant which\r\n      cannot _speak_ what ails it, but is in distress clearly, in the\r\n      inwards of it; and so must squall and whimper continually, till\r\n      its Mother take it, and it get—to sleep!\r\n\r\n      This Convention is not four days old, and the melodious Melibœan\r\n      stanzas that shook down Royalty are still fresh in our ear, when\r\n      there bursts out a new diapason,—unhappily, of Discord, this\r\n      time. For speech has been made of a thing difficult to speak of\r\n      well: the September Massacres. How deal with these September\r\n      Massacres; with the Paris Commune that presided over them? A\r\n      Paris Commune hateful-terrible; before which the poor effete\r\n      Legislative had to quail, and sit quiet. And now if a young\r\n      omnipotent Convention will not so quail and sit, what steps shall\r\n      it take? Have a Departmental Guard in its pay, answer the\r\n      Girondins, and Friends of Order! A Guard of National Volunteers,\r\n      missioned from all the Eighty-three or Eighty-five Departments,\r\n      for that express end; these will keep Septemberers, tumultuous\r\n      Communes in a due state of submissiveness, the Convention in a\r\n      due state of sovereignty. So have the Friends of Order answered,\r\n      sitting in Committee, and reporting; and even a Decree has been\r\n      passed of the required tenour. Nay certain Departments, as the\r\n      Var or Marseilles, in mere expectation and assurance of a Decree,\r\n      have their contingent of Volunteers already on march: brave\r\n      Marseillese, foremost on the Tenth of August, will not be\r\n      hindmost here; “fathers gave their sons a musket and twenty-five\r\n      louis,” says Barbaroux, “and bade them march.”\r\n\r\n      Can any thing be properer? A Republic that will found itself on\r\n      justice must needs investigate September Massacres; a Convention\r\n      calling itself National, ought it not to be guarded by a National\r\n      force?—Alas, Reader, it seems so to the eye: and yet there is\r\n      much to be said and argued. Thou beholdest here the small\r\n      beginning of a Controversy, which mere logic will not settle. Two\r\n      small well-springs, September, Departmental Guard, or rather at\r\n      bottom they are but one and the same small well-spring; which\r\n      will swell and widen into waters of bitterness; all manner of\r\n      subsidiary streams and brooks of bitterness flowing in, from this\r\n      side and that; till it become a wide river of bitterness, of rage\r\n      and separation,—which can subside only into the Catacombs. This\r\n      Departmental Guard, decreed by overwhelming majorities, and then\r\n      repealed for peace’s sake, and not to insult Paris, is again\r\n      decreed more than once; nay it is partially executed, and the\r\n      very men that are to be of it are seen visibly parading the Paris\r\n      streets,—shouting once, being overtaken with liquor: ‘_À bas\r\n      Marat_, Down with Marat!’[573] Nevertheless, decreed never so\r\n      often, it is repealed just as often; and continues, for some\r\n      seven months, an angry noisy Hypothesis only: a fair Possibility\r\n      struggling to become a Reality, but which shall never be one;\r\n      which, after endless struggling, shall, in February next, sink\r\n      into sad rest,—dragging much along with it. So singular are the\r\n      ways of men and honourable Members.\r\n\r\n      But on this fourth day of the Convention’s existence, as we said,\r\n      which is the 25th of September 1792, there comes Committee Report\r\n      on that Decree of the Departmental Guard, and speech of repealing\r\n      it; there come denunciations of anarchy, of a Dictatorship,—which\r\n      let the incorruptible Robespierre consider: there come\r\n      denunciations of a certain _Journal de la République_, once\r\n      called _Ami du Peuple;_ and so thereupon there comes, visibly\r\n      stepping up, visibly standing aloft on the Tribune, ready to\r\n      speak, the Bodily Spectrum of People’s-Friend Marat! Shriek, ye\r\n      Seven Hundred and Forty-nine; it is verily Marat, he and not\r\n      another. Marat is no phantasm of the brain, or mere lying impress\r\n      of Printer’s Types; but a thing material, of joint and sinew, and\r\n      a certain small stature: ye behold him there, in his blackness in\r\n      his dingy squalor, a living fraction of Chaos and Old Night;\r\n      visibly incarnate, desirous to speak. ‘It appears,’ says Marat to\r\n      the shrieking Assembly, ‘that a great many persons here are\r\n      enemies of mine.’ ‘All! All!’ shriek hundreds of voices: enough\r\n      to drown any People’s-Friend. But Marat will not drown: he speaks\r\n      and croaks explanation; croaks with such reasonableness, air of\r\n      sincerity, that repentant pity smothers anger, and the shrieks\r\n      subside or even become applauses. For this Convention is\r\n      unfortunately the crankest of machines: it shall be pointing\r\n      eastward, with stiff violence, this moment; and then do but touch\r\n      some spring dexterously, the whole machine, clattering and\r\n      jerking seven-hundred-fold, will whirl with huge crash, and, next\r\n      moment, is pointing westward! Thus Marat, absolved and applauded,\r\n      victorious in this turn of fence, is, as the Debate goes on,\r\n      prickt at again by some dexterous Girondin; and then the shrieks\r\n      rise anew, and Decree of Accusation is on the point of passing;\r\n      till the dingy People’s-Friend bobs aloft once more; croaks once\r\n      more persuasive stillness, and the Decree of Accusation sinks,\r\n      Whereupon he draws forth—a Pistol; and setting it to his Head,\r\n      the seat of such thought and prophecy, says: ‘If they had passed\r\n      their Accusation Decree, he, the People’s-Friend, would have\r\n      blown his brains out.’ A People’s Friend has that faculty in him.\r\n      For the rest, as to this of the two hundred and sixty thousand\r\n      Aristocrat Heads, Marat candidly says, ‘_C’est là mon avis_, such\r\n      is my opinion.’ Also it is not indisputable: ‘No power on Earth\r\n      can prevent me from seeing into traitors, and unmasking them,’—by\r\n      my superior originality of mind?[574] An honourable member like\r\n      this Friend of the People few terrestrial Parliaments have had.\r\n\r\n      We observe, however, that this first onslaught by the Friends of\r\n      Order, as sharp and prompt as it was, has failed. For neither can\r\n      Robespierre, summoned out by talk of Dictatorship, and greeted\r\n      with the like rumour on shewing himself, be thrown into Prison,\r\n      into Accusation;—not though Barbaroux openly bear testimony\r\n      against him, and sign it on paper. With such sanctified meekness\r\n      does the Incorruptible lift his seagreen cheek to the smiter;\r\n      lift his thin voice, and with jesuitic dexterity plead, and\r\n      prosper: asking at last, in a prosperous manner: ‘But what\r\n      witnesses has the Citoyen Barbaroux to support his testimony?’\r\n      ‘_Moi!_’ cries hot Rebecqui, standing up, striking his breast\r\n      with both hands, and answering, ‘Me!’[575] Nevertheless the\r\n      Seagreen pleads again, and makes it good: the long hurlyburly,\r\n      “personal merely,” while so much public matter lies fallow, has\r\n      ended in the order of the day. O Friends of the Gironde, why will\r\n      you occupy our august sessions with mere paltry Personalities,\r\n      while the grand Nationality lies in such a state?—The Gironde has\r\n      touched, this day, on the foul black-spot of its fair Convention\r\n      Domain; has trodden on it, and yet _not_ trodden it down. Alas,\r\n      it is a _well-spring_, as we said, this black-spot; and will not\r\n      tread down!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.II.\r\n      The Executive.\r\n\r\n      May we not conjecture therefore that round this grand enterprise\r\n      of Making the Constitution there will, as heretofore, very\r\n      strange embroilments gather, and questions and interests\r\n      complicate themselves; so that after a few or even several\r\n      months, the Convention will not have settled every thing? Alas, a\r\n      whole tide of questions comes rolling, boiling; growing ever\r\n      wider, without end! Among which, apart from this question of\r\n      September and Anarchy, let us notice those, which emerge oftener\r\n      than the others, and promise to become Leading Questions: of the\r\n      Armies; of the Subsistences; thirdly, of the Dethroned King.\r\n\r\n      As to the Armies, Public Defence must evidently be put on a\r\n      proper footing; for Europe seems coalising itself again; one is\r\n      apprehensive even England will join it. Happily Dumouriez\r\n      prospers in the North;—nay what if he should prove too\r\n      prosperous, and become _Liberticide_, Murderer of\r\n      Freedom!—Dumouriez prospers, through this winter season; yet not\r\n      without lamentable complaints. Sleek Pache, the Swiss\r\n      Schoolmaster, he that sat frugal in his Alley, the wonder of\r\n      neighbours, has got lately—whither thinks the Reader? To be\r\n      Minister of war! Madame Roland, struck with his sleek ways,\r\n      recommended him to her Husband as Clerk: the sleek Clerk had no\r\n      need of salary, being of true Patriotic temper; he would come\r\n      with a bit of bread in his pocket, to save dinner and time; and,\r\n      munching incidentally, do three men’s work in a day, punctual,\r\n      silent, frugal,—the sleek Tartuffe that he was. Wherefore Roland,\r\n      in the late Overturn, recommended him to be War-Minister. And\r\n      now, it would seem, he is secretly undermining Roland; playing\r\n      into the hands of your hotter Jacobins and September Commune; and\r\n      cannot, like strict Roland, be the _Veto des Coquins!_[576]\r\n\r\n      How the sleek Pache might mine and undermine, one knows not well;\r\n      this however one does know: that his War-Office has become a den\r\n      of thieves and confusion, such as all men shudder to behold. That\r\n      the Citizen Hassenfratz, as Head-Clerk, sits there in _bonnet\r\n      rouge_, in rapine, in violence, and some Mathematical\r\n      calculation; a most insolent, red-nightcapped man. That Pache\r\n      munches his pocket-loaf, amid head-clerks and sub-clerks, and has\r\n      spent all the War-Estimates: that Furnishers scour in gigs, over\r\n      all districts of France, and drive bargains;—and lastly that the\r\n      Army gets next to no furniture. No shoes, though it is winter; no\r\n      clothes; some have not even arms: “In the Army of the South,”\r\n      complains an honourable Member, “there are thirty thousand pairs\r\n      of breeches wanting,”—a most scandalous want.\r\n\r\n      Roland’s strict soul is sick to see the course things take: but\r\n      what can he do? Keep his own Department strict; rebuke, and\r\n      repress wheresoever possible; at lowest, complain. He can\r\n      complain in Letter after Letter, to a National Convention, to\r\n      France, to Posterity, the Universe; grow ever more querulous\r\n      indignant;—till at last may he not grow wearisome? For is not\r\n      this continual text of his, at bottom a rather barren one: How\r\n      astonishing that in a time of Revolt and abrogation of all Law\r\n      but Cannon Law, there should be such Unlawfulness? Intrepid\r\n      Veto-of-Scoundrels, narrow-faithful, respectable, methodic man,\r\n      work thou in that manner, since happily it is thy manner, and\r\n      wear thyself away; though ineffectual, not profitless in it—then\r\n      nor _now!_—The brave Dame Roland, bravest of all French women,\r\n      begins to have misgivings: the figure of Danton has too much of\r\n      the “Sardanapalus character,” at a Republican Rolandin\r\n      Dinner-table: Clootz, Speaker of Mankind, proses sad stuff about\r\n      a Universal Republic, or union of all Peoples and Kindreds in one\r\n      and the same Fraternal Bond; of which Bond, how it is to be\r\n      _tied_, one unhappily sees not.\r\n\r\n      It is also an indisputable, unaccountable or accountable fact\r\n      that Grains are becoming scarcer and scarcer. Riots for grain,\r\n      tumultuous Assemblages demanding to have the price of grain fixed\r\n      abound far and near. The Mayor of Paris and other poor Mayors are\r\n      like to have their difficulties. Pétion was re-elected Mayor of\r\n      Paris; but has declined; being now a Convention Legislator. Wise\r\n      surely to decline: for, besides this of Grains and all the rest,\r\n      there is in these times an Improvised insurrectionary Commune\r\n      passing into an Elected legal one; getting their accounts\r\n      settled,—not without irritancy! Pétion has declined: nevertheless\r\n      many do covet and canvass. After months of scrutinising,\r\n      balloting, arguing and jargoning, one Doctor Chambon gets the\r\n      post of honour: who will not long keep it; but be, as we shall\r\n      see, literally _crushed_ out of it.[577]\r\n\r\n      Think also if the private Sansculotte has not his difficulties,\r\n      in a time of dearth! Bread, according to the People’s-Friend, may\r\n      be some “six sous per pound, a day’s wages some fifteen;” and\r\n      grim winter here. How the Poor Man continues living, and so\r\n      seldom starves, by miracle! Happily, in these days, he can\r\n      enlist, and have himself shot by the Austrians, in an unusually\r\n      satisfactory manner: for the Rights of Man.—But Commandant\r\n      Santerre, in this so straitened condition of the flour-market,\r\n      and state of Equality and Liberty, proposes, through the\r\n      Newspapers, two remedies, or at least palliatives: _First_, that\r\n      all classes of men should live, two days of the week, on\r\n      potatoes; then _second_, that every man should hang his dog.\r\n      Hereby, as the Commandant thinks, the saving, which indeed he\r\n      computes to so many sacks, would be very considerable. A\r\n      cheerfuller form of inventive-stupidity than Commandant\r\n      Santerre’s dwells in no human soul. Inventive-stupidity, imbedded\r\n      in health, courage and good-nature: much to be commended. ‘My\r\n      whole strength,’ he tells the Convention once, ‘is, day and\r\n      night, at the service of my fellow-Citizens: if they find me\r\n      worthless, they will dismiss me; I will return and brew\r\n      beer.’[578]\r\n\r\n      Or figure what correspondences a poor Roland, Minister of the\r\n      Interior, must have, on this of Grains alone! Free-trade in\r\n      Grain, impossibility to fix the Prices of Grain; on the other\r\n      hand, clamour and necessity to fix them: Political Economy\r\n      lecturing from the Home Office, with demonstration clear as\r\n      Scripture;—ineffectual for the empty National Stomach. The Mayor\r\n      of Chartres, like to be eaten himself, cries to the Convention:\r\n      the Convention sends honourable Members in Deputation; who\r\n      endeavour to feed the multitude by miraculous spiritual methods;\r\n      but cannot. The multitude, in spite of all Eloquence, come\r\n      bellowing round; will have the Grain-Prices fixed, and at a\r\n      moderate elevation; or else—the honourable Deputies hanged on the\r\n      spot! The honourable Deputies, reporting this business, admit\r\n      that, on the edge of horrid death, they did fix, or affect to fix\r\n      the Price of Grain: for which, be it also noted, the Convention,\r\n      a Convention that will not be trifled with, sees good to\r\n      reprimand them.[579]\r\n\r\n      But as to the origin of these Grain Riots, is it not most\r\n      probably your secret Royalists again? Glimpses of Priests were\r\n      discernible in this of Chartres,—to the eye of Patriotism. Or\r\n      indeed may not “the root of it all lie in the Temple Prison, in\r\n      the heart of a perjured King,” well as we guard him?[580] Unhappy\r\n      perjured King!—And so there shall be Baker’s Queues, by and by,\r\n      more sharp-tempered than ever: on every Baker’s door-rabbet an\r\n      iron ring, and coil of rope; whereon, with firm grip, on this\r\n      side and that, we form our Queue: but mischievous deceitful\r\n      persons cut the rope, and our Queue becomes a ravelment;\r\n      wherefore the coil must be made of iron chain.[581] Also there\r\n      shall be Prices of Grain well fixed; but then no grain\r\n      purchasable by them: bread not to be had except by Ticket from\r\n      the Mayor, few ounces per mouth daily; after long swaying, with\r\n      firm grip, on the chain of the Queue. And Hunger shall stalk\r\n      direful; and Wrath and Suspicion, whetted to the Preternatural\r\n      pitch, shall stalk;—as those other preternatural “shapes of Gods\r\n      in their wrathfulness” were discerned stalking, “in glare and\r\n      gloom of that fire-ocean,” when Troy Town fell!—\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.III.\r\n      Discrowned.\r\n\r\n      But the question more pressing than all on the Legislator, as\r\n      yet, is this third: What shall be done with King Louis?\r\n\r\n      King Louis, now King and Majesty to his own family alone, in\r\n      their own Prison Apartment alone, has been Louis Capet and the\r\n      Traitor Veto with the rest of France. Shut in his Circuit of the\r\n      Temple, he has heard and seen the loud whirl of things; yells of\r\n      September Massacres, Brunswick war-thunders dying off in disaster\r\n      and discomfiture; he passive, a spectator merely;—waiting whither\r\n      it would please to whirl with him. From the neighbouring windows,\r\n      the curious, not without pity, might see him walk daily, at a\r\n      certain hour, in the Temple Garden, with his Queen, Sister and\r\n      two Children, all that now belongs to him in this Earth.[582]\r\n      Quietly he walks and waits; for he is not of lively feelings, and\r\n      is of a devout heart. The wearied Irresolute has, at least, no\r\n      need of resolving now. His daily meals, lessons to his Son, daily\r\n      walk in the Garden, daily game at ombre or drafts, fill up the\r\n      day: the morrow will provide for itself.\r\n\r\n      The morrow indeed; and yet How? Louis asks, How? France, with\r\n      perhaps still more solicitude, asks, How? A King dethroned by\r\n      insurrection is verily not easy to dispose of. Keep him prisoner,\r\n      he is a secret centre for the Disaffected, for endless plots,\r\n      attempts and hopes of theirs. Banish him, he is an open centre\r\n      for them; his royal war-standard, with what of divinity it has,\r\n      unrolls itself, summoning the world. Put him to death? A cruel\r\n      questionable extremity that too: and yet the likeliest in these\r\n      extreme circumstances, of insurrectionary men, whose own life and\r\n      death lies staked: accordingly it is said, from the last step of\r\n      the throne to the first of the scaffold there is short distance.\r\n\r\n      But, on the whole, we will remark here that this business of\r\n      Louis looks altogether different now, as seen over Seas and at\r\n      the distance of forty-four years, than it looked then, in France,\r\n      and struggling, confused all round one! For indeed it is a most\r\n      lying thing that same Past Tense always: so beautiful, sad,\r\n      almost Elysian-sacred, “in the moonlight of Memory,” it seems;\r\n      and _seems_ only. For observe: always, one most important element\r\n      is surreptitiously (we not noticing it) withdrawn from the Past\r\n      Time: the haggard element of Fear! Not _there_ does Fear dwell,\r\n      nor Uncertainty, nor Anxiety; but it dwells _here;_ haunting us,\r\n      tracking us; running like an accursed ground-discord through all\r\n      the music-tones of our Existence;—making the Tense a mere Present\r\n      one! Just so is it with this of Louis. Why smite the fallen? asks\r\n      Magnanimity, out of danger now. He is fallen so low this\r\n      once-high man; no criminal nor traitor, how far from it; but the\r\n      unhappiest of Human Solecisms: whom if abstract Justice had to\r\n      pronounce upon, she might well become concrete Pity, and\r\n      pronounce only sobs and dismissal!\r\n\r\n      So argues retrospective Magnanimity: but Pusillanimity, present,\r\n      prospective? Reader, thou hast never lived, for months, under the\r\n      rustle of Prussian gallows-ropes; never wert thou portion of a\r\n      National Sahara-waltz, Twenty-five millions running distracted to\r\n      fight Brunswick! Knights Errant themselves, when they conquered\r\n      Giants, usually slew the Giants: quarter was only for other\r\n      Knights Errant, who knew courtesy and the laws of battle. The\r\n      French Nation, in simultaneous, desperate dead-pull, and as if by\r\n      miracle of madness, has pulled down the most dread Goliath, huge\r\n      with the growth of ten centuries; and cannot believe, though his\r\n      giant bulk, covering acres, lies prostrate, bound with peg and\r\n      packthread, that he will not rise again, man-devouring; that the\r\n      victory is not partly a dream. Terror has its scepticism;\r\n      miraculous victory its rage of vengeance. Then as to criminalty,\r\n      is the prostrated Giant, who will devour us if he rise, an\r\n      innocent Giant? Curate Gregoire, who indeed is now Constitutional\r\n      Bishop Gregoire, asserts, in the heat of eloquence, that Kingship\r\n      by the very nature of it is a crime capital; that Kings’ Houses\r\n      are as wild-beasts’ dens.[583] Lastly consider this: that there\r\n      is on record a Trial of Charles First! This printed _Trial of\r\n      Charles First_ is sold and read every where at\r\n      present:[584]—_Quelle spectacle!_ Thus did the English People\r\n      judge their Tyrant, and become the first of Free Peoples: which\r\n      feat, by the grace of Destiny, may not France now rival?\r\n      Scepticism of terror, rage of miraculous victory, sublime\r\n      spectacle to the universe,—all things point one fatal way.\r\n\r\n      Such leading questions, and their endless incidental ones: of\r\n      September Anarchists and Departmental Guard; of Grain Riots,\r\n      plaintiff Interior Ministers; of Armies, Hassenfratz\r\n      dilapidations; and what is to be done with Louis,—beleaguer and\r\n      embroil this Convention; which would so gladly make the\r\n      Constitution rather. All which questions too, as we often urge of\r\n      such things, are in _growth;_ they grow in every French head; and\r\n      can be _seen_ growing also, very curiously, in this mighty welter\r\n      of Parliamentary Debate, of Public Business which the Convention\r\n      has to do. A question emerges, so small at first; is put off,\r\n      submerged; but always re-emerges bigger than before. It is a\r\n      curious, indeed an indescribable sort of growth which such things\r\n      have.\r\n\r\n      We perceive, however, both by its frequent re-emergence and by\r\n      its rapid enlargement of bulk, that this Question of King Louis\r\n      will take the lead of all the rest. And truly, in that case, it\r\n      will take the _lead_ in a much deeper sense. For as Aaron’s Rod\r\n      swallowed all the other Serpents; so will the Foremost Question,\r\n      whichever may get foremost, absorb all other questions and\r\n      interests; and from it and the decision of it will they all, so\r\n      to speak, be _born_, or new-born, and have shape, physiognomy and\r\n      destiny corresponding. It was appointed of Fate that, in this\r\n      wide-weltering, strangely growing, monstrous stupendous imbroglio\r\n      of Convention Business, the grand First-Parent of all the\r\n      questions, controversies, measures and enterprises which were to\r\n      be evolved there to the world’s astonishment, should be this\r\n      Question of King Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.IV.\r\n      The Loser Pays.\r\n\r\n      The Sixth of November, 1792, was a great day for the Republic:\r\n      outwardly, over the Frontiers; inwardly, in the _Salle de\r\n      Manége_.\r\n\r\n      Outwardly: for Dumouriez, overrunning the Netherlands, did, on\r\n      that day, come in contact with Saxe-Teschen and the Austrians;\r\n      Dumouriez wide-winged, they wide-winged; at and around the\r\n      village of Jemappes, near Mons. And fire-hail is whistling far\r\n      and wide there, the great guns playing, and the small; so many\r\n      green Heights getting fringed and maned with red Fire. And\r\n      Dumouriez is swept back on this wing, and swept back on that, and\r\n      is like to be swept back utterly; when he rushes up in person,\r\n      the prompt Polymetis; speaks a prompt word or two; and then, with\r\n      clear tenor-pipe, “uplifts the Hymn of the Marseillese, _entonna\r\n      la Marseillaise_,”[585] ten thousand tenor or bass pipes joining;\r\n      or say, some Forty Thousand in all; for every heart leaps at the\r\n      sound: and so with rhythmic march-melody, waxing ever quicker, to\r\n      double and to treble quick, they rally, they advance, they rush,\r\n      death-defying, man-devouring; carry batteries, redoutes,\r\n      whatsoever is to be carried; and, like the fire-whirlwind, sweep\r\n      all manner of Austrians from the scene of action. Thus, through\r\n      the hands of Dumouriez, may Rouget de Lille, in figurative\r\n      speech, be said to have gained, miraculously, like another\r\n      Orpheus, by his Marseillese fiddle-strings (_fidibus canoris_) a\r\n      Victory of Jemappes; and conquered the Low Countries.\r\n\r\n      Young General Egalité, it would seem, shone brave among the\r\n      bravest on this occasion. Doubtless a brave Egalité;—whom however\r\n      does not Dumouriez rather talk of oftener than need were? The\r\n      Mother Society has her own thoughts. As for the Elder Egalité he\r\n      flies low at this time; appears in the Convention for some\r\n      half-hour daily, with rubicund, pre-occupied, or impressive\r\n      quasi-contemptuous countenance; and then takes himself away.[586]\r\n      The Netherlands are conquered, at least overrun. Jacobin\r\n      missionaries, your Prolys, Pereiras, follow in the train of the\r\n      Armies; also Convention Commissioners, melting church-plate,\r\n      revolutionising and remodelling—among whom Danton, in brief\r\n      space, does immensities of business; not neglecting his own wages\r\n      and trade-profits, it is thought. Hassenfratz dilapidates at\r\n      home; Dumouriez grumbles and they dilapidate abroad: within the\r\n      walls there is sinning, and without the walls there is sinning.\r\n\r\n      But in the Hall of the Convention, at the same hour with this\r\n      victory of Jemappes, there went another thing forward: Report, of\r\n      great length, from the proper appointed Committee, on the Crimes\r\n      of Louis. The Galleries listen breathless; take comfort, ye\r\n      Galleries: Deputy Valazé, Reporter on this occasion, thinks Louis\r\n      very criminal; and that, if convenient, he should be tried;—poor\r\n      Girondin Valazé, who may be tried himself, one day! Comfortable\r\n      so far. Nay here comes a second Committee-reporter, Deputy\r\n      Mailhe, with a Legal Argument, very prosy to read now, very\r\n      refreshing to hear then, That, by the Law of the Country, Louis\r\n      Capet was only called Inviolable by a figure of rhetoric; but at\r\n      bottom was perfectly violable, triable; that he can, and even\r\n      should be tried. This Question of Louis, emerging so often as an\r\n      angry confused possibility, and submerging again, has emerged now\r\n      in an articulate shape.\r\n\r\n      Patriotism growls indignant joy. The so-called reign of Equality\r\n      is not to be a mere name, then, but a thing! Try Louis Capet?\r\n      scornfully ejaculates Patriotism: Mean criminals go to the\r\n      gallows for a purse cut; and this chief criminal, guilty of a\r\n      France cut; of a France slashed asunder with Clotho-scissors and\r\n      Civil war; with his victims “twelve hundred on the Tenth of\r\n      August alone” lying low in the Catacombs, fattening the passes of\r\n      Argonne Wood, of Valmy and far Fields; _he_, such chief criminal,\r\n      shall not even come to the bar?—For, alas, O Patriotism! add we,\r\n      it was from of old said, _The loser pays!_ It is he who has to\r\n      pay _all_ scores, run up by whomsoever; on him must all breakages\r\n      and charges fall; and the twelve hundred on the Tenth of August\r\n      are not rebel traitors, but victims and martyrs: such is the law\r\n      of quarrel.\r\n\r\n      Patriotism, nothing doubting, watches over this Question of the\r\n      Trial, now happily emerged in an articulate shape; and will see\r\n      it to maturity, if the gods permit. With a keen solicitude\r\n      Patriotism watches; getting ever keener, at every new difficulty,\r\n      as Girondins and false brothers interpose delays; till it get a\r\n      keenness as of fixed-idea, and will have this Trial and no\r\n      earthly thing instead of it,—if Equality be not a name. Love of\r\n      Equality; then scepticism of terror, rage of victory, sublime\r\n      spectacle of the universe: all these things are strong.\r\n\r\n      But indeed this Question of the Trial, is it not to all persons a\r\n      most grave one; filling with dubiety many a Legislative head!\r\n      Regicide? asks the Gironde Respectability: To kill a king, and\r\n      become the horror of respectable nations and persons? But then\r\n      also, to save a king; to lose one’s footing with the decided\r\n      Patriot; and undecided Patriot, though never so respectable,\r\n      being mere hypothetic froth and no footing?—The dilemma presses\r\n      sore; and between the horns of it you wriggle round and round.\r\n      Decision is nowhere, save in the Mother Society and her Sons.\r\n      These have decided, and go forward: the others wriggle round\r\n      uneasily within their dilemma-horns, and make way nowhither.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.V.\r\n      Stretching of Formulas.\r\n\r\n      But how this Question of the Trial grew laboriously, through the\r\n      weeks of gestation, now that it has been articulated or\r\n      conceived, were superfluous to trace here. It emerged and\r\n      submerged among the infinite of questions and embroilments. The\r\n      Veto of Scoundrels writes plaintive Letters as to Anarchy;\r\n      “concealed Royalists,” aided by Hunger, produce Riots about\r\n      Grain. Alas, it is but a week ago, these Girondins made a new\r\n      fierce onslaught on the September Massacres!\r\n\r\n      For, one day, among the last of October, Robespierre, being\r\n      summoned to the tribune by some new hint of that old calumny of\r\n      the Dictatorship, was speaking and pleading there, with more and\r\n      more comfort to himself; till, rising high in heart, he cried out\r\n      valiantly: Is there any man here that dare specifically accuse\r\n      me? ‘_Moi!_’ exclaimed one. Pause of deep silence: a lean angry\r\n      little Figure, with broad bald brow, strode swiftly towards the\r\n      tribune, taking papers from its pocket: ‘I accuse thee,\r\n      Robespierre,’—I, Jean Baptiste Louvet! The Seagreen became\r\n      tallow-green; shrinking to a corner of the tribune: Danton cried,\r\n      ‘Speak, Robespierre, there are many good citizens that listen;’\r\n      but the tongue refused its office. And so Louvet, with a shrill\r\n      tone, read and recited crime after crime: dictatorial temper,\r\n      exclusive popularity, bullying at elections, mob-retinue,\r\n      September Massacres;—till all the Convention shrieked again, and\r\n      had almost indicted the Incorruptible there on the spot. Never\r\n      did the Incorruptible run such a risk. Louvet, to his dying day,\r\n      will regret that the Gironde did not take a bolder attitude, and\r\n      extinguish him there and then.\r\n\r\n      Not so, however: the Incorruptible, about to be indicted in this\r\n      sudden manner, could not be refused a week of delay. That week,\r\n      he is not idle; nor is the Mother Society idle,—fierce-tremulous\r\n      for her chosen son. He is ready at the day with his written\r\n      Speech; smooth as a Jesuit Doctor’s; and convinces some. And now?\r\n      Why, now lazy Vergniaud does not rise with Demosthenic thunder;\r\n      poor Louvet, unprepared, can do little or nothing: Barrère\r\n      proposes that these comparatively despicable “personalities” be\r\n      dismissed by order of the day! Order of the day it accordingly\r\n      is. Barbaroux cannot even get a hearing; not though he rush down\r\n      to the Bar, and demand to be heard there as a petitioner.[587]\r\n      The convention, eager for public business (with that first\r\n      articulate emergence of the Trial just coming on), dismisses\r\n      these comparative _misères_ and despicabilities: splenetic Louvet\r\n      must digest his spleen, regretfully for ever: Robespierre, dear\r\n      to Patriotism, is dearer for the dangers he has run.\r\n\r\n      This is the second grand attempt by our Girondin Friends of\r\n      Order, to extinguish that black-spot in their domain; and we see\r\n      they have made it far blacker and wider than before! Anarchy,\r\n      September Massacre: it is a thing that lies hideous in the\r\n      general imagination; very detestable to the undecided Patriot, of\r\n      Respectability: a thing to be harped on as often as need is. Harp\r\n      on it, denounce it, trample it, ye Girondin Patriots:—and yet\r\n      behold, the black-spot will not trample down; it will only, as we\r\n      say, trample blacker and wider: fools, it is no black-spot of the\r\n      surface, but a well-spring of the deep! Consider rightly, it is\r\n      the apex of the everlasting Abyss, this black-spot, looking up as\r\n      water through thin ice;—say, as the region of Nether Darkness\r\n      through your thin film of Gironde Regulation and Respectability;\r\n      trample it _not_, lest the film break, and then—!\r\n\r\n      The truth is, if our Gironde Friends had an understanding of it,\r\n      where were French Patriotism, with all its eloquence, at this\r\n      moment, had _not_ that same great Nether Deep, of Bedlam,\r\n      Fanaticism and Popular wrath and madness, risen unfathomable on\r\n      the Tenth of August? French Patriotism were an eloquent\r\n      Reminiscence; swinging on Prussian gibbets. Nay, where, in few\r\n      months, were it still, should the same great Nether Deep\r\n      subside?—Nay, as readers of Newspapers pretend to recollect, this\r\n      hatefulness of the September Massacre is itself partly an\r\n      after-thought: readers of Newspapers can quote Gorsas and various\r\n      Brissotins approving of the September Massacre, at the time it\r\n      happened; and calling it a salutary vengeance![588] So that the\r\n      real grief, after all, were not so much righteous horror, as\r\n      grief that one’s own power was departing? Unhappy Girondins!\r\n\r\n      In the Jacobin Society, therefore, the decided Patriot complains\r\n      that here are men who with their private ambitions and\r\n      animosities, will ruin Liberty, Equality, and Brotherhood, all\r\n      three: they check the spirit of Patriotism, throw\r\n      stumbling-blocks in its way; and instead of pushing on, all\r\n      shoulders at the wheel, will stand idle there, spitefully\r\n      clamouring what foul ruts there are, what rude jolts we give! To\r\n      which the Jacobin Society answers with angry roar;—with angry\r\n      shriek, for there are Citoyennes too, thick crowded in the\r\n      galleries here. Citoyennes who bring their seam with them, or\r\n      their knitting-needles; and shriek or knit as the case needs;\r\n      famed _Tricoteuses_, Patriot Knitters;—_Mère Duchesse_, or the\r\n      like Deborah and Mother of the Faubourgs, giving the keynote. It\r\n      is a changed Jacobin Society; and a still changing. Where Mother\r\n      Duchess now sits, authentic Duchesses have sat. High-rouged dames\r\n      went once in jewels and spangles; now, instead of jewels, you may\r\n      take the knitting-needles and leave the rouge: the rouge will\r\n      gradually give place to natural brown, clean washed or even\r\n      unwashed; and Demoiselle Théroigne herself get scandalously\r\n      fustigated. Strange enough: it is the same tribune raised in\r\n      mid-air, where a high Mirabeau, a high Barnave and Aristocrat\r\n      Lameths once thundered: whom gradually your Brissots, Guadets,\r\n      Vergniauds, a hotter style of Patriots in _bonnet rouge_, did\r\n      displace; red heat, as one may say, superseding light. And now\r\n      your Brissots in turn, and Brissotins, Rolandins, Girondins, are\r\n      becoming supernumerary; must desert the sittings, or be expelled:\r\n      the light of the Mighty Mother is burning not red but\r\n      blue!—Provincial Daughter-Societies loudly disapprove these\r\n      things; loudly demand the swift reinstatement of such eloquent\r\n      Girondins, the swift “erasure of Marat, _radiation de Marat_.”\r\n      The Mother Society, so far as natural reason can predict, seems\r\n      ruining herself. Nevertheless she has, at all crises, seemed so;\r\n      she has a _preter_natural life in her, and will not ruin.\r\n\r\n      But, in a fortnight more, this great Question of the Trial, while\r\n      the fit Committee is assiduously but silently working on it,\r\n      receives an unexpected stimulus. Our readers remember poor\r\n      Louis’s turn for smithwork: how, in old happier days, a certain\r\n      Sieur Gamain of Versailles was wont to come over, and instruct\r\n      him in lock-making;—often scolding him, they say for his\r\n      numbness. By whom, nevertheless, the royal Apprentice had learned\r\n      something of that craft. Hapless Apprentice; perfidious\r\n      Master-Smith! For now, on this 20th of November 1792, dingy Smith\r\n      Gamain comes over to the Paris Municipality, over to Minister\r\n      Roland, with hints that he, Smith Gamain, knows a thing; that, in\r\n      May last, when traitorous Correspondence was so brisk, he and the\r\n      royal Apprentice fabricated an “Iron Press, _Armoire de Fer_,”\r\n      cunningly inserting the same in a wall of the royal chamber in\r\n      the Tuileries; invisible under the wainscot; where doubtless it\r\n      still sticks! Perfidious Gamain, attended by the proper\r\n      Authorities, finds the wainscot panel which none else can find;\r\n      wrenches it up; discloses the Iron Press,—full of Letters and\r\n      Papers! Roland clutches them out; conveys them over in towels to\r\n      the fit assiduous Committee, which sits hard by. In towels, we\r\n      say, and without notarial inventory; an oversight on the part of\r\n      Roland.\r\n\r\n      Here, however, are Letters enough: which disclose to a\r\n      demonstration the Correspondence of a traitorous self-preserving\r\n      Court; and this not with Traitors only, but even with Patriots,\r\n      so-called! Barnave’s treason, of Correspondence with the Queen,\r\n      and friendly advice to her, ever since that Varennes Business, is\r\n      hereby manifest: how happy that we have him, this Barnave, lying\r\n      safe in the Prison of Grenoble, since September last, for he had\r\n      long been suspect! Talleyrand’s treason, many a man’s treason, if\r\n      not manifest hereby, is next to it. Mirabeau’s treason: wherefore\r\n      his Bust in the Hall of the Convention “is veiled with gauze,”\r\n      till we ascertain. Alas, it is too ascertainable! His Bust in the\r\n      Hall of the Jacobins, denounced by Robespierre from the tribune\r\n      in mid-air, is not veiled, it is instantly broken to sherds; a\r\n      Patriot mounting swiftly with a ladder, and shivering it down on\r\n      the floor;—it and others: amid shouts.[589] Such is _their_\r\n      recompense and amount of wages, at this date: on the principle of\r\n      supply and demand! Smith Gamain, inadequately recompensed for the\r\n      present, comes, some fifteen months after, with a humble\r\n      Petition; setting forth that no sooner was that important Iron\r\n      Press finished off by him, than (as he now bethinks himself)\r\n      Louis gave him a large glass of wine. Which large glass of wine\r\n      did produce in the stomach of Sieur Gamain the terriblest\r\n      effects, evidently tending towards death, and was then brought up\r\n      by an emetic; but has, notwithstanding, entirely ruined the\r\n      constitution of Sieur Gamain; so that he cannot work for his\r\n      family (as he now bethinks himself). The recompense of _which_ is\r\n      “Pension of Twelve Hundred Francs,” and “honourable mention.” So\r\n      different is the ratio of demand and supply at different times.\r\n\r\n      Thus, amid obstructions and stimulating furtherances, has the\r\n      Question of the Trial to grow; emerging and submerging; fostered\r\n      by solicitous Patriotism. Of the Orations that were spoken on it,\r\n      of the painfully devised Forms of Process for managing it, the\r\n      Law Arguments to prove it lawful, and all the infinite floods of\r\n      Juridical and other ingenuity and oratory, be no syllable\r\n      reported in this History. Lawyer ingenuity is good: but what can\r\n      it profit here? If the truth must be spoken, O august Senators,\r\n      the only Law in this case is: _Væ victis_, the loser pays! Seldom\r\n      did Robespierre say a wiser word than the hint he gave to that\r\n      effect, in his oration, that it was needless to speak of Law,\r\n      that here, if never elsewhere, our Right was Might. An oration\r\n      admired almost to ecstasy by the Jacobin Patriot: who shall say\r\n      that Robespierre is not a thorough-going man; bold in Logic at\r\n      least? To the like effect, or still more plainly, spake young\r\n      Saint-Just, the black-haired, mild-toned youth. Danton is on\r\n      mission, in the Netherlands, during this preliminary work. The\r\n      rest, far as one reads, welter amid Law of Nations, Social\r\n      Contract, Juristics, Syllogistics; to us barren as the East wind.\r\n      In fact, what can be more unprofitable than the sight of Seven\r\n      Hundred and Forty-nine ingenious men, struggling with their whole\r\n      force and industry, for a long course of weeks, to do at bottom\r\n      this: To stretch out the old Formula and Law Phraseology, so that\r\n      it may cover the new, contradictory, entirely _un_coverable\r\n      Thing? Whereby the poor Formula does but _crack_, and one’s\r\n      honesty along with it! The thing that is palpably _hot_, burning,\r\n      wilt thou prove it, by syllogism, to be a freezing-mixture? This\r\n      of stretching out Formulas till they crack is, especially in\r\n      times of swift change, one of the sorrowfullest tasks poor\r\n      Humanity has.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.VI.\r\n      At the Bar.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, in a space of some five weeks, we have got to another\r\n      emerging of the Trial, and a more practical one than ever.\r\n\r\n      On Tuesday, eleventh of December, the King’s Trial has _emerged_,\r\n      very decidedly: into the streets of Paris; in the shape of that\r\n      green Carriage of Mayor Chambon, within which sits the King\r\n      himself, with attendants, on his way to the Convention Hall!\r\n      Attended, in that green Carriage, by Mayors Chambon, Procureurs\r\n      Chaumette; and outside of it by Commandants Santerre, with\r\n      cannon, cavalry and double row of infantry; all Sections under\r\n      arms, strong Patrols scouring all streets; so fares he, slowly\r\n      through the dull drizzling weather: and about two o’clock we\r\n      behold him, “in walnut-coloured great-coat, _redingote\r\n      noisette_,” descending through the Place Vendôme, towards that\r\n      Salle de Manége; to be indicted, and judicially interrogated. The\r\n      mysterious Temple Circuit has given up its secret; which now, in\r\n      this walnut-coloured coat, men behold with eyes. The same bodily\r\n      Louis who was once Louis the Desired, fares there: hapless King,\r\n      he is getting now towards port; his deplorable farings and\r\n      voyagings draw to a close. What duty remains to him henceforth,\r\n      that of placidly enduring, he is fit to do.\r\n\r\n      The singular Procession fares on; in silence, says Prudhomme, or\r\n      amid growlings of the Marseillese Hymn; in silence, ushers itself\r\n      into the Hall of the Convention, Santerre holding Louis’s arm\r\n      with his hand. Louis looks round him, with composed air, to see\r\n      what kind of Convention and Parliament it is. Much changed\r\n      indeed:—since February gone two years, when our Constituent, then\r\n      busy, spread fleur-de-lys velvet for us; and we came over to say\r\n      a kind word here, and they all started up swearing Fidelity; and\r\n      all France started up swearing, and made it a Feast of Pikes;\r\n      which has ended in this! Barrère, who once “wept” looking up from\r\n      his Editor’s-Desk, looks down now from his President’s-Chair,\r\n      with a list of Fifty-seven Questions; and says, dry-eyed: ‘Louis,\r\n      you may sit down.’ Louis sits down: it is the very seat, they\r\n      say, same timber and stuffing, from which he accepted the\r\n      Constitution, amid dancing and illumination, autumn gone a year.\r\n      So much woodwork remains identical; so much else is not\r\n      identical. Louis sits and listens, with a composed look and mind.\r\n\r\n      Of the Fifty-seven Questions we shall not give so much as one.\r\n      They are questions captiously embracing all the main Documents\r\n      seized on the Tenth of August, or found lately in the Iron Press;\r\n      embracing all the main incidents of the Revolution History; and\r\n      they ask, in substance, this: Louis, who wert King, art thou not\r\n      guilty to a certain extent, by act and written document, of\r\n      trying to continue King? Neither in the Answers is there much\r\n      notable. Mere quiet negations, for most part; an accused man\r\n      standing on the simple basis of _No:_ I do not recognise that\r\n      document; I did not do that act; or did it according to the law\r\n      that then was. Whereupon the Fifty-seven Questions, and Documents\r\n      to the number of a Hundred and Sixty-two, being exhausted in this\r\n      manner, Barrère finishes, after some three hours, with his:\r\n      ‘Louis, I invite you to withdraw.’\r\n\r\n      Louis withdraws, under Municipal escort, into a neighbouring\r\n      Committee-room; having first, in leaving the bar, demanded to\r\n      have Legal Counsel. He declines refreshment, in this\r\n      Committee-room, then, seeing Chaumette busy with a small loaf\r\n      which a grenadier had divided with him, says, he will take a bit\r\n      of bread. It is five o’clock; and he had breakfasted but slightly\r\n      in a morning of such drumming and alarm. Chaumette breaks his\r\n      half-loaf: the King eats of the crust; mounts the green Carriage,\r\n      eating; asks now what he shall do with the crumb? Chaumette’s\r\n      clerk takes it from him; flings it out into the street. Louis\r\n      says, It is pity to fling out bread, in a time of dearth. ‘My\r\n      grandmother,’ remarks Chaumette, ‘used to say to me, Little boy,\r\n      never waste a crumb of bread, you cannot make one.’ ‘Monsieur\r\n      Chaumette,’ answers Louis, ‘your grandmother seems to have been a\r\n      sensible woman.’[590] Poor innocent mortal: so quietly he waits\r\n      the drawing of the lot;—fit to do this at least well; Passivity\r\n      alone, without Activity, sufficing for it! He talks once of\r\n      travelling over France by and by, to have a geographical and\r\n      topographical view of it; being from of old fond of\r\n      geography.—The Temple Circuit again receives him, closes on him;\r\n      gazing Paris may retire to its hearths and coffee-houses, to its\r\n      clubs and theatres: the damp Darkness has sunk, and with it the\r\n      drumming and patrolling of this strange Day.\r\n\r\n      Louis is now separated from his Queen and Family; given up to his\r\n      simple reflections and resources. Dull lie these stone walls\r\n      round him; of his loved ones none with him. In this state of\r\n      “uncertainty,” providing for the worst, he writes his Will: a\r\n      Paper which can still be read; full of placidity, simplicity,\r\n      pious sweetness. The Convention, after debate, has granted him\r\n      Legal Counsel, of his own choosing. Advocate Target feels himself\r\n      “too old,” being turned of fifty-four; and declines. He had\r\n      gained great honour once, defending Rohan the Necklace-Cardinal;\r\n      but will gain none here. Advocate Tronchet, some ten years older,\r\n      does not decline. Nay behold, good old Malesherbes steps forward\r\n      voluntarily; to the last of his fields, the good old hero! He is\r\n      grey with seventy years: he says, “I was twice called to the\r\n      Council of him who was my Master, when all the world coveted that\r\n      honour; and I owe him the same service now, when it has become\r\n      one which many reckon dangerous.” These two, with a younger\r\n      Desèze, whom they will select for pleading, are busy over that\r\n      Fifty-and-sevenfold Indictment, over the Hundred and Sixty-two\r\n      Documents; Louis aiding them as he can.\r\n\r\n      A great Thing is now therefore in open progress; all men, in all\r\n      lands, watching it. By what Forms and Methods shall the\r\n      Convention acquit itself, in such manner that there rest not on\r\n      it even the suspicion of blame? Difficult that will be! The\r\n      Convention, really much at a loss, discusses and deliberates. All\r\n      day from morning to night, day after day, the Tribune drones with\r\n      oratory on this matter; one must stretch the old Formula to cover\r\n      the new Thing. The Patriots of the Mountain, whetted ever keener,\r\n      clamour for despatch above all; the only good Form will be a\r\n      swift one. Nevertheless the Convention deliberates; the Tribune\r\n      drones,—drowned indeed in tenor, and even in treble, from time to\r\n      time; the whole Hall shrilling up round it into pretty frequent\r\n      wrath and provocation. It has droned and shrilled wellnigh a\r\n      fortnight, before we can decide, this shrillness getting ever\r\n      shriller, That on Wednesday 26th of December, Louis shall appear,\r\n      and plead. His Advocates complain that it is fatally soon; which\r\n      they well might as Advocates: but without remedy; to Patriotism\r\n      it seems endlessly late.\r\n\r\n      On Wednesday, therefore, at the cold dark hour of eight in the\r\n      morning, all Senators are at their post. Indeed they warm the\r\n      cold hour, as we find, by a violent effervescence, such as is too\r\n      common now; some Louvet or Buzot attacking some Tallien, Chabot;\r\n      and so the whole Mountain effervescing against the whole Gironde.\r\n      Scarcely is this done, at nine, when Louis and his three\r\n      Advocates, escorted by the clang of arms and Santerre’s National\r\n      force, enter the Hall.\r\n\r\n      Desèze unfolds his papers; honourably fulfilling his perilous\r\n      office, pleads for the space of three hours. An honourable\r\n      Pleading, “composed almost overnight;” courageous yet discreet;\r\n      not without ingenuity, and soft pathetic eloquence: Louis fell on\r\n      his neck, when they had withdrawn, and said with tears, _Mon\r\n      pauvre Desèze_. Louis himself, before withdrawing, had added a\r\n      few words, ‘perhaps the last he would utter to them:’ how it\r\n      pained his heart, above all things, to be held guilty of that\r\n      bloodshed on the Tenth of August; or of ever shedding or wishing\r\n      to shed French blood. So saying, he withdrew from that\r\n      Hall;—having indeed finished his work there. Many are the strange\r\n      errands he has had thither; but this strange one is the last.\r\n\r\n      And now, why will the Convention loiter? Here is the Indictment\r\n      and Evidence; here is the Pleading: does not the rest follow of\r\n      itself? The Mountain, and Patriotism in general, clamours still\r\n      louder for despatch; for Permanent-session, till the task be\r\n      done. Nevertheless a doubting, apprehensive Convention decides\r\n      that it will still deliberate first; that all Members, who desire\r\n      it, shall have leave to speak.—To your desks, therefore, ye\r\n      eloquent Members! Down with your thoughts, your echoes and\r\n      hearsays of thoughts: now is the time to shew oneself; France and\r\n      the Universe listens! Members are not wanting: Oration spoken\r\n      Pamphlet follows spoken Pamphlet, with what eloquence it can:\r\n      President’s List swells ever higher with names claiming to speak;\r\n      from day to day, all days and all hours, the constant Tribune\r\n      drones;—shrill Galleries supplying, very variably, the tenor and\r\n      treble. It were a dull tune otherwise.\r\n\r\n      The Patriots, in Mountain and Galleries, or taking counsel\r\n      nightly in Section-house, in Mother Society, amid their shrill\r\n      _Tricoteuses_, have to watch lynx-eyed; to give voice when\r\n      needful; occasionally very loud. Deputy Thuriot, he who was\r\n      Advocate Thuriot, who was Elector Thuriot, and from the top of\r\n      the Bastille, saw Saint-Antoine rising like the ocean; this\r\n      Thuriot can stretch a Formula as heartily as most men. Cruel\r\n      Billaud is not silent, if you incite him. Nor is cruel Jean-Bon\r\n      silent; a kind of Jesuit he too;—write him not, as the\r\n      Dictionaries too often do, _Jambon_, which signifies mere _Ham_.\r\n\r\n      But, on the whole, let no man conceive it possible that Louis is\r\n      not guilty. The only question for a reasonable man is, or was:\r\n      Can the Convention judge Louis? Or must it be the whole People:\r\n      in Primary Assembly, and with delay? Always delay, ye Girondins,\r\n      false _hommes d’état!_ so bellows Patriotism, its patience almost\r\n      failing.—But indeed, if we consider it, what shall these poor\r\n      Girondins do? Speak their convictions that Louis is a Prisoner of\r\n      War; and cannot be put to death without injustice, solecism,\r\n      peril? Speak such conviction; and lose utterly your footing with\r\n      the decided Patriot? Nay properly it is not even a conviction,\r\n      but a conjecture and dim puzzle. How many poor Girondins are sure\r\n      of but one thing: That a man and Girondin ought to _have_ footing\r\n      somewhere, and to stand firmly on it; keeping well with the\r\n      Respectable Classes! _This_ is what conviction and assurance of\r\n      faith they have. They must wriggle painfully between their\r\n      dilemma-horns.[591]\r\n\r\n      Nor is France idle, nor Europe. It is a Heart this Convention, as\r\n      we said, which sends out influences, and receives them. A King’s\r\n      Execution, call it Martyrdom, call it Punishment, were an\r\n      influence! Two notable influences this Convention has already\r\n      sent forth, over all Nations; much to its own detriment. On the\r\n      19th of November, it emitted a Decree, and has since confirmed\r\n      and unfolded the details of it. That any Nation which might see\r\n      good to shake off the fetters of Despotism was thereby, so to\r\n      speak, the Sister of France, and should have help and\r\n      countenance. A Decree much noised of by Diplomatists, Editors,\r\n      International Lawyers; such a Decree as no living Fetter of\r\n      Despotism, nor Person in Authority anywhere, can approve of! It\r\n      was Deputy Chambon the Girondin who propounded this Decree;—at\r\n      bottom perhaps as a flourish of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n      The second influence we speak of had a still poorer origin: in\r\n      the restless loud-rattling slightly-furnished head of one Jacob\r\n      Dupont from the Loire country. The Convention is speculating on a\r\n      plan of National Education: Deputy Dupont in his speech says, ‘I\r\n      am free to avow, M. le Président, that I for my part am an\r\n      Atheist,’[592]—thinking the world might like to know that. The\r\n      French world received it without commentary; or with no audible\r\n      commentary, so _loud_ was France otherwise. The Foreign world\r\n      received it with confutation, with horror and astonishment;[593]\r\n      a most miserable influence this! And now if to these two were\r\n      added a third influence, and sent pulsing abroad over all the\r\n      Earth: that of Regicide?\r\n\r\n      Foreign Courts interfere in this Trial of Louis; Spain, England:\r\n      not to be listened to; though they come, as it were, at least\r\n      Spain comes, with the olive-branch in one hand, and the sword\r\n      without scabbard in the other. But at home too, from out of this\r\n      circumambient Paris and France, what influences come\r\n      thick-pulsing! Petitions flow in; pleading for equal justice, in\r\n      a reign of so-called Equality. The living Patriot pleads;—O ye\r\n      National Deputies, do not the dead Patriots plead? The Twelve\r\n      Hundred that lie in cold obstruction, do not they plead; and\r\n      petition, in Death’s dumb-show, from their narrow house there,\r\n      more eloquently than speech? Crippled Patriots hop on crutches\r\n      round the Salle de Manége, demanding justice. The Wounded of the\r\n      Tenth of August, the Widows and Orphans of the Killed petition in\r\n      a body; and hop and defile, eloquently mute, through the Hall:\r\n      one wounded Patriot, unable to hop, is borne on his bed thither,\r\n      and passes shoulder-high, in the horizontal posture.[594] The\r\n      Convention Tribune, which has paused at such sight, commences\r\n      again,—droning mere Juristic Oratory. But out of doors Paris is\r\n      piping ever higher. Bull-voiced St. Huruge is heard; and the\r\n      hysteric eloquence of Mother Duchesse: “Varlet, Apostle of\r\n      Liberty,” with pike and red cap, flies hastily, carrying his\r\n      oratorical folding-stool. Justice on the Traitor! cries all the\r\n      Patriot world. Consider also this other cry, heard loud on the\r\n      streets: ‘Give us Bread, or else kill us!’ Bread and Equality;\r\n      Justice on the Traitor, that we may have Bread!\r\n\r\n      The Limited or undecided Patriot is set against the Decided.\r\n      Mayor Chambon heard of dreadful rioting at the _Théâtre de la\r\n      Nation:_ it had come to rioting, and even to fist-work, between\r\n      the Decided and the Undecided, touching a new Drama called _Ami\r\n      des Lois_ (Friend of the Laws). One of the poorest Dramas ever\r\n      written; but which had didactic applications in it; wherefore\r\n      powdered wigs of Friends of Order and black hair of Jacobin heads\r\n      are flying there; and Mayor Chambon hastens with Santerre, in\r\n      hopes to quell it. Far from quelling it, our poor Mayor gets so\r\n      “squeezed,” says the Report, and likewise so blamed and bullied,\r\n      say we,—that he, with regret, quits the brief Mayoralty\r\n      altogether, “his lungs being affected.” This miserable _Amis des\r\n      Lois_ is debated of in the Convention itself; so violent,\r\n      mutually-enraged, are the Limited Patriots and the\r\n      Unlimited.[595]\r\n\r\n      Between which two classes, are not Aristocrats enough, and\r\n      Crypto-Aristocrats, busy? Spies running over from London with\r\n      important Packets; spies pretending to run! One of these latter,\r\n      Viard was the name of him, pretended to accuse Roland, and even\r\n      the Wife of Roland; to the joy of Chabot and the Mountain. But\r\n      the Wife of Roland came, being summoned, on the instant, to the\r\n      Convention Hall; came, in her high clearness; and, with few clear\r\n      words, dissipated this Viard into despicability and air; all\r\n      Friends of Order applauding.[596] So, with Theatre-riots, and\r\n      “Bread, or else kill us;” with Rage, Hunger, preternatural\r\n      Suspicion, does this wild Paris pipe. Roland grows ever more\r\n      querulous, in his Messages and Letters; rising almost to the\r\n      hysterical pitch. Marat, whom no power on Earth can prevent\r\n      seeing into traitors and Rolands, takes to bed for three days;\r\n      almost dead, the invaluable People’s-Friend, with heartbreak,\r\n      with fever and headache: “_O, Peuple babillard, si tu savais\r\n      agir_, People of Babblers, if thou couldst but _act!_”\r\n\r\n      To crown all, victorious Dumouriez, in these New-year’s days, is\r\n      arrived in Paris;—one fears, for no good. He pretends to be\r\n      complaining of Minister Pache, and Hassenfratz dilapidations; to\r\n      be concerting measures for the spring campaign: one finds him\r\n      much in the company of the Girondins. Plotting with them against\r\n      Jacobinism, against Equality, and the Punishment of Louis! We\r\n      have Letters of his to the Convention itself. Will he act the old\r\n      Lafayette part, this new victorious General? Let him withdraw\r\n      again; not undenounced.[597]\r\n\r\n      And still, in the Convention Tribune, it drones continually, mere\r\n      Juristic Eloquence, and Hypothesis without Action; and there are\r\n      still fifties on the President’s List. Nay these Gironde\r\n      Presidents give their own party preference: we suspect they play\r\n      foul with the List; men of the Mountain cannot be heard. And\r\n      still it drones, all through December into January and a New\r\n      year; and there is no end! Paris pipes round it; multitudinous;\r\n      ever higher, to the note of the whirlwind. Paris will “bring\r\n      cannon from Saint-Denis;” there is talk of “shutting the\r\n      Barriers,”—to Roland’s horror.\r\n\r\n      Whereupon, behold, the Convention Tribune suddenly ceases\r\n      droning: we cut short, be on the List who likes; and make end. On\r\n      Tuesday next, the Fifteenth of January 1793, it shall go to the\r\n      Vote, name by name; and, one way or other, this great game play\r\n      itself out!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.VII.\r\n      The Three Votings.\r\n\r\n      Is Louis Capet guilty of conspiring against Liberty? Shall our\r\n      Sentence be itself final, or need ratifying by Appeal to the\r\n      People? If guilty, what Punishment? This is the form agreed to,\r\n      after uproar and “several hours of tumultuous indecision:” these\r\n      are the Three successive Questions, whereon the Convention shall\r\n      now pronounce. Paris floods round their Hall; multitudinous, many\r\n      sounding. Europe and all Nations listen for their answer. Deputy\r\n      after Deputy shall answer to his name: Guilty or Not guilty?\r\n\r\n      As to the Guilt, there is, as above hinted, no doubt in the mind\r\n      of Patriot man. Overwhelming majority pronounces Guilt; the\r\n      unanimous Convention votes for Guilt, only some feeble\r\n      twenty-eight voting not Innocence, but refusing to vote at all.\r\n      Neither does the Second Question prove doubtful, whatever the\r\n      Girondins might calculate. Would not Appeal to the People be\r\n      another name for civil war? Majority of two to one answers that\r\n      there shall be no Appeal: this also is settled. Loud Patriotism,\r\n      now at ten o’clock, may hush itself for the night; and retire to\r\n      its bed not without hope. Tuesday has gone well. On the morrow\r\n      comes, What Punishment? On the morrow is the tug of war.\r\n\r\n      Consider therefore if, on this Wednesday morning, there is an\r\n      affluence of Patriotism; if Paris stands a-tiptoe, and all\r\n      Deputies are at their post! Seven Hundred and Forty-nine\r\n      honourable Deputies; only some twenty absent on mission, Duchâtel\r\n      and some seven others absent by sickness. Meanwhile expectant\r\n      Patriotism and Paris standing a-tiptoe, have need of patience.\r\n      For this Wednesday again passes in debate and effervescence;\r\n      Girondins proposing that a “majority of three-fourths” shall be\r\n      required; Patriots fiercely resisting them. Danton, who has just\r\n      got back from mission in the Netherlands, does obtain “order of\r\n      the day” on this Girondin proposal; nay he obtains further that\r\n      we decide _sans désemparer_, in Permanent-session, till we have\r\n      done.\r\n\r\n      And so, finally, at eight in the evening this Third stupendous\r\n      Voting, by roll-call or _appel nominal_, does begin. What\r\n      Punishment? Girondins undecided, Patriots decided, men afraid of\r\n      Royalty, men afraid of Anarchy, must answer here and now.\r\n      Infinite Patriotism, dusky in the lamp-light, floods all\r\n      corridors, crowds all galleries, sternly waiting to hear.\r\n      Shrill-sounding Ushers summon you by Name and Department; you\r\n      must rise to the Tribune and say.\r\n\r\n      Eye-witnesses have represented this scene of the Third Voting,\r\n      and of the votings that grew out of it; a scene protracted, like\r\n      to be endless, lasting, with few brief intervals, from Wednesday\r\n      till Sunday morning,—as one of the strangest seen in the\r\n      Revolution. Long night wears itself into day, morning’s paleness\r\n      is spread over all faces; and again the wintry shadows sink, and\r\n      the dim lamps are lit: but through day and night and the\r\n      vicissitude of hours, Member after Member is mounting continually\r\n      those Tribune-steps; pausing aloft there, in the clearer upper\r\n      light, to speak his Fate-word; then diving down into the dusk and\r\n      throng again. Like Phantoms in the hour of midnight; most\r\n      spectral, pandemonial! Never did President Vergniaud, or any\r\n      terrestrial President, superintend the like. A King’s Life, and\r\n      so much else that depends thereon, hangs trembling in the\r\n      balance. Man after man mounts; the buzz hushes itself till he\r\n      have spoken: Death; Banishment: Imprisonment till the Peace. Many\r\n      say, Death; with what cautious well-studied phrases and\r\n      paragraphs they could devise, of explanation, of enforcement, of\r\n      faint recommendation to mercy. Many too say, Banishment;\r\n      something short of Death. The balance trembles, none can yet\r\n      guess whitherward. Whereat anxious Patriotism bellows;\r\n      irrepressible by Ushers.\r\n\r\n      The poor Girondins, many of them, under such fierce bellowing of\r\n      Patriotism, say Death; justifying, _motivant_, that most\r\n      miserable word of theirs by some brief casuistry and jesuitry.\r\n      Vergniaud himself says, Death; justifying by jesuitry. Rich\r\n      Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau had been of the Noblesse, and then of\r\n      the Patriot Left Side, in the Constituent; and had argued and\r\n      reported, there and elsewhere, not a little, _against_ Capital\r\n      Punishment: nevertheless he now says, Death; a word which may\r\n      cost him dear. Manuel did surely rank with the Decided in August\r\n      last; but he has been sinking and backsliding ever since\r\n      September, and the scenes of September. In this Convention, above\r\n      all, no word he could speak would find favour; he says now,\r\n      Banishment; and in mute wrath quits the place for ever,—much\r\n      hustled in the corridors. Philippe Egalité votes in his soul and\r\n      conscience, Death, at the sound of which, and of whom, even\r\n      Patriotism shakes its head; and there runs a groan and shudder\r\n      through this Hall of Doom. Robespierre’s vote cannot be doubtful;\r\n      his speech is long. Men see the figure of shrill Sieyes ascend;\r\n      hardly pausing, passing merely, this figure says, ‘_La Mort sans\r\n      phrase_, Death without phrases;’ and fares onward and downward.\r\n      Most spectral, pandemonial!\r\n\r\n      And yet if the Reader fancy it of a funereal, sorrowful or even\r\n      grave character, he is far mistaken. “The Ushers in the Mountain\r\n      quarter,” says Mercier, “had become as Box-openers at the Opera;”\r\n      opening and shutting of Galleries for privileged persons, for\r\n      “d’Orléans Egalité’s mistresses,” or other high-dizened women of\r\n      condition, rustling with laces and tricolor. Gallant Deputies\r\n      pass and repass thitherward, treating them with ices,\r\n      refreshments and small-talk; the high-dizened heads beck\r\n      responsive; some have their card and pin, pricking down the Ayes\r\n      and Noes, as at a game of _Rouge-et-Noir_. Further aloft reigns\r\n      Mère Duchesse with her unrouged Amazons; she cannot be prevented\r\n      making long _Hahas_, when the vote is not _La Mort_. In these\r\n      Galleries there is refection, drinking of wine and brandy “as in\r\n      open tavern, _en pleine tabagie_.” Betting goes on in all\r\n      coffeehouses of the neighbourhood. But within doors, fatigue,\r\n      impatience, uttermost weariness sits now on all visages; lighted\r\n      up only from time to time, by turns of the game. Members have\r\n      fallen asleep; Ushers come and awaken them to vote: other Members\r\n      calculate whether they shall not have time to run and dine.\r\n      Figures rise, like phantoms, pale in the dusky lamp-light; utter\r\n      from this Tribune, only one word: Death. “_Tout est optique_,”\r\n      says Mercier, “the world is all an optical shadow.”[598] Deep in\r\n      the Thursday night, when the Voting is done, and Secretaries are\r\n      summing it up, sick Duchâtel, more spectral than another, comes\r\n      borne on a chair, wrapt in blankets, “in nightgown and nightcap,”\r\n      to vote for Mercy: one vote it is thought may turn the scale.\r\n\r\n      Ah no! In profoundest silence, President Vergniaud, with a voice\r\n      full of sorrow, has to say: ‘I declare, in the name of the\r\n      Convention, that the Punishment it pronounces on Louis Capet is\r\n      that of Death.’ Death by a small majority of Fifty-three. Nay, if\r\n      we deduct from the one side, and add to the other, a certain\r\n      Twenty-six, who said Death but coupled some faintest ineffectual\r\n      surmise of mercy with it, the majority will be but _One_.\r\n\r\n      Death is the sentence: but its execution? It is not executed yet!\r\n      Scarcely is the vote declared when Louis’s Three Advocates enter;\r\n      with Protest in his name, with demand for Delay, for Appeal to\r\n      the People. For this do Desèze and Tronchet plead, with brief\r\n      eloquence: brave old Malesherbes pleads for it with eloquent want\r\n      of eloquence, in broken sentences, in embarrassment and sobs;\r\n      that brave time-honoured face, with its grey strength, its broad\r\n      sagacity and honesty, is mastered with emotion, melts into dumb\r\n      tears.[599]—They reject the Appeal to the People; that having\r\n      been already settled. But as to the Delay, what they call\r\n      _Sursis_, it _shall_ be considered; shall be voted for tomorrow:\r\n      at present we adjourn. Whereupon Patriotism “hisses” from the\r\n      Mountain: but a “tyrannical majority” has so decided, and\r\n      adjourns.\r\n\r\n      There is still this _fourth_ Vote then, growls indignant\r\n      Patriotism:—this vote, and who knows what other votes, and\r\n      adjournments of voting; and the whole matter still hovering\r\n      hypothetical! And at every new vote those Jesuit Girondins, even\r\n      they who voted for Death, would so fain find a loophole!\r\n      Patriotism must watch and rage. Tyrannical adjournments there\r\n      have been; one, and now another at midnight on plea of\r\n      fatigue,—all Friday wasted in hesitation and higgling; in\r\n      _re_-counting of the votes, which are found correct as they\r\n      stood! Patriotism bays fiercer than ever; Patriotism, by\r\n      long-watching, has become red-eyed, almost rabid.\r\n\r\n      ‘Delay: yes or no?’ men do vote it finally, all Saturday, all day\r\n      and night. Men’s nerves are worn out, men’s hearts are desperate;\r\n      now it shall end. Vergniaud, spite of the baying, ventures to say\r\n      Yes, Delay; though he had voted Death. Philippe Egalité says, in\r\n      his soul and conscience, No. The next Member mounting: ‘Since\r\n      Philippe says No, I for my part say Yes, _Moi je dis Oui_.’ The\r\n      balance still trembles. Till finally, at three o’clock on Sunday\r\n      morning, we have: _No Delay_, by a majority of Seventy; _Death\r\n      within four-and-twenty hours!_\r\n\r\n      Garat Minister of Justice has to go to the Temple, with this\r\n      stern message: he ejaculates repeatedly, ‘_Quelle commission\r\n      affreuse_, What a frightful function!’[600] Louis begs for a\r\n      Confessor; for yet three days of life, to prepare himself to die.\r\n      The Confessor is granted; the three days and all respite are\r\n      refused.\r\n\r\n      There is no deliverance, then? Thick stone walls answer, None—Has\r\n      King Louis no friends? Men of action, of courage grown desperate,\r\n      in this his extreme need? King Louis’s friends are feeble and\r\n      far. Not even a voice in the coffeehouses rises for him. At Méot\r\n      the Restaurateur’s no Captain Dampmartin now dines; or sees\r\n      death-doing whiskerandoes on furlough exhibit daggers of improved\r\n      structure! Méot’s gallant Royalists on furlough are far across\r\n      the Marches; they are wandering distracted over the world: or\r\n      their bones lie whitening Argonne Wood. Only some weak Priests\r\n      “leave Pamphlets on all the bournestones,” this night, calling\r\n      for a rescue; calling for the pious women to rise; or are taken\r\n      distributing Pamphlets, and sent to prison.[601]\r\n\r\n      Nay there is one death-doer, of the ancient Méot sort, who, with\r\n      effort, has done even less and worse: slain a Deputy, and set all\r\n      the Patriotism of Paris on edge! It was five on Saturday evening\r\n      when Lepelletier St. Fargeau, having given his vote, _No Delay_,\r\n      ran over to Février’s in the Palais Royal to snatch a morsel of\r\n      dinner. He had dined, and was paying. A thickset man “with black\r\n      hair and blue beard,” in a loose kind of frock, stept up to him;\r\n      it was, as Février and the bystanders bethought them, one Pâris\r\n      of the old King’s-Guard. ‘Are you Lepelletier?’ asks\r\n      he.—‘Yes.’—‘You voted in the King’s Business?’—‘I voted\r\n      Death.’—‘_Scélérat_, take that!’ cries Pâris, flashing out a\r\n      sabre from under his frock, and plunging it deep in Lepelletier’s\r\n      side. Février clutches him; but he breaks off; is gone.\r\n\r\n      The voter Lepelletier lies dead; he has expired in great pain, at\r\n      one in the morning;—two hours before that Vote of _No Delay_ was\r\n      fully summed up! Guardsman Pâris is flying over France; cannot be\r\n      taken; will be found some months after, self-shot in a remote\r\n      inn.[602]—Robespierre sees reason to think that Prince d’Artois\r\n      himself is privately in Town; that the Convention will be\r\n      butchered in the lump. Patriotism sounds mere wail and vengeance:\r\n      Santerre doubles and trebles all his patrols. Pity is lost in\r\n      rage and fear; the Convention has refused the three days of life\r\n      and all respite.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.2.VIII.\r\n      Place de la Révolution.\r\n\r\n      To this conclusion, then, hast thou come, O hapless Louis! The\r\n      Son of Sixty Kings is to die on the Scaffold by form of law.\r\n      Under Sixty Kings this same form of Law, form of Society, has\r\n      been fashioning itself together, these thousand years; and has\r\n      become, one way and other, a most strange Machine. Surely, if\r\n      needful, it is also frightful this Machine; dead, blind; not what\r\n      it should be; which, with swift stroke, or by cold slow torture,\r\n      has wasted the lives and souls of innumerable men. And behold now\r\n      a King himself, or say rather Kinghood in his person, is to\r\n      expire here in cruel tortures;—like a Phalaris shut in the belly\r\n      of his own red-heated Brazen Bull! It is ever so; and thou\r\n      shouldst know it, O haughty tyrannous man: injustice breeds\r\n      injustice; curses and falsehoods do verily “return always home,”\r\n      wide as they may wander. Innocent Louis bears the sins of many\r\n      generations: he too experiences that man’s tribunal is not in\r\n      this Earth; that if he had no Higher one, it were not well with\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      A King dying by such violence appeals impressively to the\r\n      imagination; as the like must do, and ought to do. And yet at\r\n      bottom it is not the King dying, but the Man! Kingship is a coat;\r\n      the grand loss is of the skin. The man from whom you take his\r\n      Life, to him can the whole combined world do _more?_ Lally went\r\n      on his hurdle, his mouth filled with a gag. Miserablest mortals,\r\n      doomed for picking pockets, have a whole five-act Tragedy in\r\n      them, in that dumb pain, as they go to the gallows, unregarded;\r\n      they consume the cup of trembling down to the lees. For Kings and\r\n      for Beggars, for the justly doomed and the unjustly, it is a hard\r\n      thing to die. Pity them all: thy utmost pity with all aids and\r\n      appliances and throne-and-scaffold contrasts, how far short is it\r\n      of the thing pitied!\r\n\r\n      A Confessor has come; Abbé Edgeworth, of Irish extraction, whom\r\n      the King knew by good report, has come promptly on this solemn\r\n      mission. Leave the Earth alone, then, thou hapless King; it with\r\n      its malice will go its way, thou also canst go thine. A hard\r\n      scene yet remains: the parting with our loved ones. Kind hearts,\r\n      environed in the same grim peril with us; to be left _here!_ Let\r\n      the Reader look with the eyes of Valet Cléry, through these\r\n      glass-doors, where also the Municipality watches; and see the\r\n      cruellest of scenes:\r\n\r\n      “At half-past eight, the door of the ante-room opened: the Queen\r\n      appeared first, leading her Son by the hand; then Madame Royale\r\n      and Madame Elizabeth: they all flung themselves into the arms of\r\n      the King. Silence reigned for some minutes; interrupted only by\r\n      sobs. The Queen made a movement to lead his Majesty towards the\r\n      inner room, where M. Edgeworth was waiting unknown to them: ‘No,’\r\n      said the King, ‘let us go into the dining-room, it is there only\r\n      that I can see you.’ They entered there; I shut the door of it,\r\n      which was of glass. The King sat down, the Queen on his left\r\n      hand, Madame Elizabeth on his right, Madame Royale almost in\r\n      front; the young Prince remained standing between his Father’s\r\n      legs. They all leaned towards him, and often held him embraced.\r\n      This scene of woe lasted an hour and three-quarters; during which\r\n      we could hear nothing; we could see only that always when the\r\n      King spoke, the sobbings of the Princesses redoubled, continued\r\n      for some minutes; and that then the King began again to\r\n      speak.”[603]—And so our meetings and our partings do now end! The\r\n      sorrows we gave each other; the poor joys we faithfully shared,\r\n      and all our lovings and our sufferings, and confused toilings\r\n      under the earthly Sun, are over. Thou good soul, I shall never,\r\n      never through all ages of Time, see thee any more!—NEVER! O\r\n      Reader, knowest thou that hard word?\r\n\r\n      For nearly two hours this agony lasts; then they tear themselves\r\n      asunder. ‘Promise that you will see us on the morrow.’ He\r\n      promises:—Ah yes, yes; yet once; and go now, ye loved ones; cry\r\n      to God for yourselves and me!—It was a hard scene, but it is\r\n      over. He will not see them on the morrow. The Queen in passing\r\n      through the ante-room glanced at the Cerberus Municipals; and\r\n      with woman’s vehemence, said through her tears, ‘_Vous êtes tous\r\n      des scélérats_.’\r\n\r\n      King Louis slept sound, till five in the morning, when Cléry, as\r\n      he had been ordered, awoke him. Cléry dressed his hair. While\r\n      this went forward, Louis took a ring from his watch, and kept\r\n      trying it on his finger; it was his wedding-ring, which he is now\r\n      to return to the Queen as a mute farewell. At half-past six, he\r\n      took the Sacrament; and continued in devotion, and conference\r\n      with Abbé Edgeworth. He will not see his Family: it were too hard\r\n      to bear.\r\n\r\n      At eight, the Municipals enter: the King gives them his Will and\r\n      messages and effects; which they, at first, brutally refuse to\r\n      take charge of: he gives them a roll of gold pieces, a hundred\r\n      and twenty-five louis; these are to be returned to Malesherbes,\r\n      who had lent them. At nine, Santerre says the hour is come. The\r\n      King begs yet to retire for three minutes. At the end of three\r\n      minutes, Santerre again says the hour is come. “Stamping on the\r\n      ground with his right foot, Louis answers: ‘_Partons_, let us\r\n      go.’”—How the rolling of those drums comes in, through the Temple\r\n      bastions and bulwarks, on the heart of a queenly wife; soon to be\r\n      a widow! He is gone, then, and has not seen us? A Queen weeps\r\n      bitterly; a King’s Sister and Children. Over all these Four does\r\n      Death also hover: all shall perish miserably save one; she, as\r\n      Duchesse d’Angouleme, will live,—not happily.\r\n\r\n      At the Temple Gate were some faint cries, perhaps from voices of\r\n      pitiful women: ‘_Grâce! Grâce!_’ Through the rest of the streets\r\n      there is silence as of the grave. No man not armed is allowed to\r\n      be there: the armed, did any even pity, dare not express it, each\r\n      man overawed by all his neighbours. All windows are down, none\r\n      seen looking through them. All shops are shut. No wheel-carriage\r\n      rolls this morning, in these streets but one only. Eighty\r\n      thousand armed men stand ranked, like armed statues of men;\r\n      cannons bristle, cannoneers with match burning, but no word or\r\n      movement: it is as a city enchanted into silence and stone; one\r\n      carriage with its escort, slowly rumbling, is the only sound.\r\n      Louis reads, in his Book of Devotion, the Prayers of the Dying:\r\n      clatter of this death-march falls sharp on the ear, in the great\r\n      silence; but the thought would fain struggle heavenward, and\r\n      forget the Earth.\r\n\r\n      As the clocks strike ten, behold the Place de la Révolution, once\r\n      Place de Louis Quinze: the Guillotine, mounted near the old\r\n      Pedestal where once stood the Statue of that Louis! Far round,\r\n      all bristles with cannons and armed men: spectators crowding in\r\n      the rear; d’Orléans Egalité there in cabriolet. Swift messengers,\r\n      _hoquetons_, speed to the Townhall, every three minutes: near by\r\n      is the Convention sitting,—vengeful for Lepelletier. Heedless of\r\n      all, Louis reads his Prayers of the Dying; not till five minutes\r\n      yet has he finished; then the Carriage opens. What temper he is\r\n      in? Ten different witnesses will give ten different accounts of\r\n      it. He is in the collision of all tempers; arrived now at the\r\n      black Mahlstrom and descent of Death: in sorrow, in indignation,\r\n      in resignation struggling to be resigned. ‘Take care of M.\r\n      Edgeworth,’ he straitly charges the Lieutenant who is sitting\r\n      with them: then they two descend.\r\n\r\n      The drums are beating: ‘_Taisez-vous_, Silence!’ he cries “in a\r\n      terrible voice, _d’une voix terrible_.” He mounts the scaffold,\r\n      not without delay; he is in puce coat, breeches of grey, white\r\n      stockings. He strips off the coat; stands disclosed in a\r\n      sleeve-waistcoat of white flannel. The Executioners approach to\r\n      bind him: he spurns, resists; Abbé Edgeworth has to remind him\r\n      how the Saviour, in whom men trust, submitted to be bound. His\r\n      hands are tied, his head bare; the fatal moment is come. He\r\n      advances to the edge of the Scaffold, “his face very red,” and\r\n      says: ‘Frenchmen, I die innocent: it is from the Scaffold and\r\n      near appearing before God that I tell you so. I pardon my\r\n      enemies; I desire that France—’ A General on horseback, Santerre\r\n      or another, prances out with uplifted hand: ‘_Tambours!_’ The\r\n      drums drown the voice. ‘Executioners do your duty!’ The\r\n      Executioners, desperate lest themselves be murdered (for Santerre\r\n      and his Armed Ranks will strike, if they do not), seize the\r\n      hapless Louis: six of them desperate, him singly desperate,\r\n      struggling there; and bind him to their plank. Abbé Edgeworth,\r\n      stooping, bespeaks him: ‘Son of Saint Louis, ascend to Heaven.’\r\n      The Axe clanks down; a King’s Life is shorn away. It is Monday\r\n      the 21st of January 1793. He was aged Thirty-eight years four\r\n      months and twenty-eight days.[604]\r\n\r\n      Executioner Samson shews the Head: fierce shout of _Vive la\r\n      République_ rises, and swells; caps raised on bayonets, hats\r\n      waving: students of the College of Four Nations take it up, on\r\n      the far Quais; fling it over Paris. Orleans drives off in his\r\n      cabriolet; the Townhall Councillors rub their hands, saying, ‘It\r\n      is done, It is done.’ There is dipping of handkerchiefs, of\r\n      pike-points in the blood. Headsman Samson, though he afterwards\r\n      denied it,[605] sells locks of the hair: fractions of the puce\r\n      coat are long after worn in rings.[606]—And so, in some half-hour\r\n      it is done; and the multitude has all departed. Pastrycooks,\r\n      coffee-sellers, milkmen sing out their trivial quotidian cries:\r\n      the world wags on, as if this were a common day. In the\r\n      coffeehouses that evening, says Prudhomme, Patriot shook hands\r\n      with Patriot in a more cordial manner than usual. Not till some\r\n      days after, according to Mercier, did public men see what a grave\r\n      thing it was.\r\n\r\n      A grave thing it indisputably is; and will have consequences. On\r\n      the morrow morning, Roland, so long steeped to the lips in\r\n      disgust and chagrin, sends in his demission. His accounts lie all\r\n      ready, correct in black-on-white to the uttermost farthing: these\r\n      he wants but to have audited, that he might retire to remote\r\n      obscurity to the country and his books. They will never be\r\n      audited those accounts; he will never get retired thither.\r\n\r\n      It was on Tuesday that Roland demitted. On Thursday comes\r\n      Lepelletier St. Fargeau’s Funeral, and passage to the Pantheon of\r\n      Great Men. Notable as the wild pageant of a winter day. The Body\r\n      is borne aloft, half-bare; the winding sheet disclosing the\r\n      death-wound: sabre and bloody clothes parade themselves; a\r\n      “lugubrious music” wailing harsh _næniæ_. Oak-crowns shower down\r\n      from windows; President Vergniaud walks there, with Convention,\r\n      with Jacobin Society, and all Patriots of every colour, all\r\n      mourning brotherlike.\r\n\r\n      Notable also for another thing, this Burial of Lepelletier: it\r\n      was the last act these men ever did with concert! All Parties and\r\n      figures of Opinion, that agitate this distracted France and its\r\n      Convention, now stand, as it were, face to face, and dagger to\r\n      dagger; the King’s Life, round which they all struck and battled,\r\n      being hurled down. Dumouriez, conquering Holland, growls ominous\r\n      discontent, at the head of Armies. Men say Dumouriez will have a\r\n      King; that young d’Orléans Egalité shall be his King. Deputy\r\n      Fauchet, in the _Journal des Amis_, curses his day, more bitterly\r\n      than Job did; invokes the poniards of Regicides, of “Arras\r\n      Vipers” or Robespierres, of Pluto Dantons, of horrid Butchers\r\n      Legendre and Simulacra d’Herbois, to send him swiftly to another\r\n      world than _theirs_.[607] This is _Te-Deum_ Fauchet, of the\r\n      Bastille Victory, of the _Cercle Social_. Sharp was the\r\n      death-hail rattling round one’s Flag-of-truce, on that Bastille\r\n      day: but it was soft to such wreckage of high Hope as this; one’s\r\n      New Golden Era going down in leaden dross, and sulphurous black\r\n      of the Everlasting Darkness!\r\n\r\n      At home this Killing of a King has divided all friends; and\r\n      abroad it has united all enemies. Fraternity of Peoples,\r\n      Revolutionary Propagandism; Atheism, Regicide; total destruction\r\n      of social order in this world! All Kings, and lovers of Kings,\r\n      and haters of Anarchy, rank in coalition; as in a war for life.\r\n      England signifies to Citizen Chauvelin, the Ambassador or rather\r\n      Ambassador’s-Cloak, that he must quit the country in eight days.\r\n      Ambassador’s-Cloak and Ambassador, Chauvelin and Talleyrand,\r\n      depart accordingly.[608] Talleyrand, implicated in that Iron\r\n      Press of the Tuileries, thinks it safest to make for America.\r\n\r\n      England has cast out the Embassy: England declares war,—being\r\n      shocked principally, it would seem, at the condition of the River\r\n      Scheldt. Spain declares war; being shocked principally at some\r\n      other thing; which doubtless the Manifesto indicates.[609] Nay we\r\n      find it was not England that declared war first, or Spain first;\r\n      but that France herself declared war first on both of\r\n      them;[610]—a point of immense Parliamentary and Journalistic\r\n      interest in those days, but which has become of no interest\r\n      whatever in these. They all declare war. The sword is drawn, the\r\n      scabbard thrown away. It is even as Danton said, in one of his\r\n      all-too gigantic figures: ‘The coalised Kings threaten us; we\r\n      hurl at their feet, as gage of battle, the Head of a King.’\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 3.III.\r\n      THE GIRONDINS\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.I.\r\n      Cause and Effect.\r\n\r\n      This huge Insurrectionary Movement, which we liken to a breaking\r\n      out of Tophet and the Abyss, has swept away Royalty, Aristocracy,\r\n      and a King’s life. The question is, What will it next do; how\r\n      will it henceforth shape itself? Settle down into a reign of Law\r\n      and Liberty; according as the habits, persuasions and endeavours\r\n      of the educated, monied, respectable class prescribe? That is to\r\n      say: the volcanic lava-flood, bursting up in the manner\r\n      described, will explode and flow according to Girondin Formula\r\n      and pre-established rule of Philosophy? If so, for our Girondin\r\n      friends it will be well.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile were not the prophecy rather that as no external force,\r\n      Royal or other, now remains which could control this Movement,\r\n      the Movement will follow a course of its own; probably a very\r\n      original one? Further, that whatsoever man or men can best\r\n      interpret the inward tendencies it has, and give them voice and\r\n      activity, will obtain the lead of it? For the rest, that as a\r\n      thing _without_ order, a thing proceeding from beyond and beneath\r\n      the region of order, it must work and welter, not as a Regularity\r\n      but as a Chaos; destructive and self-destructive; always till\r\n      something that _has_ order arise, strong enough to bind it into\r\n      subjection again? Which something, we may further conjecture,\r\n      will not be a Formula, with philosophical propositions and\r\n      forensic eloquence; but a Reality, probably with a sword in its\r\n      hand!\r\n\r\n      As for the Girondin Formula, of a respectable Republic for the\r\n      Middle Classes, all manner of Aristocracies being now\r\n      sufficiently demolished, there seems little reason to expect that\r\n      the business will stop there. _Liberty, Equality, Fraternity_,\r\n      these are the words; enunciative and prophetic. Republic for the\r\n      respectable washed Middle Classes, how can that be the fulfilment\r\n      thereof? Hunger and nakedness, and nightmare oppression lying\r\n      heavy on Twenty-five million hearts; this, not the wounded\r\n      vanities or contradicted philosophies of philosophical Advocates,\r\n      rich Shopkeepers, rural Noblesse, was the prime mover in the\r\n      French Revolution; as the like will be in all such Revolutions,\r\n      in all countries. Feudal Fleur-de-lys had become an insupportably\r\n      bad marching banner, and needed to be torn and trampled: but\r\n      Moneybag of Mammon (for that, in these times, is what the\r\n      respectable Republic for the Middle Classes will signify) is a\r\n      still worse, while it lasts. Properly, indeed, it is the worst\r\n      and basest of all banners, and symbols of dominion among men; and\r\n      indeed is possible only in a time of general Atheism, and\r\n      Unbelief in any thing save in brute Force and Sensualism; pride\r\n      of birth, pride of office, any known kind of pride being a degree\r\n      better than purse-pride. Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood: not in\r\n      the Moneybag, but far elsewhere, will Sansculottism seek these\r\n      things.\r\n\r\n      We say therefore that an Insurrectionary France, loose of control\r\n      from without, destitute of supreme order from within, will form\r\n      one of the most tumultuous Activities ever seen on this Earth;\r\n      such as no Girondin Formula can regulate. An immeasurable force,\r\n      made up of forces manifold, heterogeneous, compatible and\r\n      incompatible. In plainer words, this France must needs split into\r\n      Parties; each of which seeking to make itself good,\r\n      contradiction, exasperation will arise; and Parties on Parties\r\n      find that they cannot work together, cannot exist together.\r\n\r\n      As for the number of Parties, there will, strictly counting, be\r\n      as many Parties as there are Opinions. According to which rule,\r\n      in this National Convention itself, to say nothing of France\r\n      generally, the number of Parties ought to be Seven Hundred and\r\n      Forty-Nine; for every unit entertains his opinion. But now as\r\n      every unit has at once an individual nature, or necessity to\r\n      follow his own road, and a gregarious nature or necessity to see\r\n      himself travelling by the side of others,—what can there be but\r\n      dissolutions, precipitations, endless turbulence of attracting\r\n      and repelling; till once the master-element get evolved, and this\r\n      wild alchemy arrange itself again?\r\n\r\n      To the length of Seven Hundred and Forty-nine Parties, however,\r\n      no Nation was ever yet seen to go. Nor indeed much beyond the\r\n      length of Two Parties; two at a time;—so invincible is man’s\r\n      tendency to unite, with all the invincible divisiveness he has!\r\n      Two Parties, we say, are the usual number at one time: let these\r\n      two fight it out, all minor shades of party rallying under the\r\n      shade likest them; when the one has fought down the other, then\r\n      it, in its turn, may divide, self-destructive; and so the process\r\n      continue, as far as needful. This is the way of Revolutions,\r\n      which spring up as the French one has done; when the so-called\r\n      Bonds of Society snap asunder; and all Laws that are not Laws of\r\n      Nature become naught and Formulas merely.\r\n\r\n      But quitting these somewhat abstract considerations, let History\r\n      note this concrete reality which the streets of Paris exhibit, on\r\n      Monday the 25th of February 1793. Long before daylight that\r\n      morning, these streets are noisy and angry. Petitioning enough\r\n      there has been; a Convention often solicited. It was but\r\n      yesterday there came a Deputation of Washerwomen with Petition;\r\n      complaining that not so much as soap could be had; to say nothing\r\n      of bread, and condiments of bread. The cry of women, round the\r\n      Salle de Manége, was heard plaintive: ‘_Du pain et du savon_,\r\n      Bread and Soap.’[611]\r\n\r\n      And now from six o’clock, this Monday morning, one perceives the\r\n      Baker’s Queues unusually expanded, angrily agitating themselves.\r\n      Not the Baker alone, but two Section Commissioners to help him,\r\n      manage with difficulty the daily distribution of loaves.\r\n      Soft-spoken assiduous, in the early candle-light, are Baker and\r\n      Commissioners: and yet the pale chill February sunrise discloses\r\n      an unpromising scene. Indignant Female Patriots, partly supplied\r\n      with bread, rush now to the shops, declaring that they will have\r\n      groceries. Groceries enough: sugar-barrels rolled forth into the\r\n      street, Patriot Citoyennes weighing it out at a just rate of\r\n      eleven-pence a pound; likewise coffee-chests, soap-chests, nay\r\n      cinnamon and cloves-chests, with _aquavitæ_ and other forms of\r\n      alcohol,—at a just rate, which some do not pay; the pale-faced\r\n      Grocer silently wringing his hands! What help? The distributive\r\n      Citoyennes are of violent speech and gesture, their long\r\n      Eumenides’ hair hanging out of curl; nay in their girdles pistols\r\n      are seen sticking: some, it is even said, have _beards_,—male\r\n      Patriots in petticoats and mob-cap. Thus, in the streets of\r\n      Lombards, in the street of Five-Diamonds, street of Pullies, in\r\n      most streets of Paris does it effervesce, the livelong day; no\r\n      Municipality, no Mayor Pache, though he was War-Minister lately,\r\n      sends military against it, or aught against it but\r\n      persuasive-eloquence, till seven at night, or later.\r\n\r\n      On Monday gone five weeks, which was the twenty-first of January,\r\n      we saw Paris, beheading its King, stand silent, like a petrified\r\n      City of Enchantment: and now on this Monday it is so noisy,\r\n      selling sugar! Cities, especially Cities in Revolution, are\r\n      subject to these alternations; the secret courses of civic\r\n      business and existence effervescing and efflorescing, in this\r\n      manner, as a concrete Phenomenon to the eye. Of which Phenomenon,\r\n      when secret existence becoming public effloresces on the street,\r\n      the philosophical cause-and-effect is not so easy to find. What,\r\n      for example, may be the accurate philosophical meaning, and\r\n      meanings, of this sale of sugar? These things that have become\r\n      visible in the street of Pullies and over Paris, whence are they,\r\n      we say; and whither?—\r\n\r\n      That Pitt has a hand in it, the gold of Pitt: so much, to all\r\n      reasonable Patriot men, may seem clear. But then, through what\r\n      agents of Pitt? Varlet, Apostle of Liberty, was discerned again\r\n      of late, with his pike and his red nightcap. Deputy Marat\r\n      published in his journal, this very day, complaining of the\r\n      bitter scarcity, and sufferings of the people, till he seemed to\r\n      get wroth: “If your Rights of Man were anything but a piece of\r\n      written paper, the plunder of a few shops, and a forestaller or\r\n      two hung up at the door-lintels, would put an end to such\r\n      things.”[612] Are not these, say the Girondins, pregnant\r\n      indications? Pitt has bribed the Anarchists; Marat is the agent\r\n      of Pitt: hence this sale of sugar. To the Mother Society, again,\r\n      it is clear that the scarcity is factitious; is the work of\r\n      Girondins, and such like; a set of men sold partly to Pitt; sold\r\n      wholly to their own ambitions, and hard-hearted pedantries; who\r\n      will not fix the grain-prices, but prate pedantically of\r\n      free-trade; wishing to starve Paris into violence, and embroil it\r\n      with the Departments: _hence_ this sale of sugar.\r\n\r\n      And, alas, if to these two notabilities, of a Phenomenon and such\r\n      Theories of a Phenomenon, we add this third notability, That the\r\n      French Nation has believed, for several years now, in the\r\n      possibility, nay certainty and near advent, of a universal\r\n      Millennium, or reign of Freedom, Equality, Fraternity, wherein\r\n      man should be the brother of man, and sorrow and sin flee away?\r\n      Not bread to eat, nor soap to wash with; and the reign of perfect\r\n      Felicity ready to arrive, due always since the Bastille fell! How\r\n      did our hearts burn within us, at that Feast of Pikes, when\r\n      brother flung himself on brother’s bosom; and in sunny jubilee,\r\n      Twenty-five millions burst forth into sound and cannon-smoke!\r\n      Bright was our Hope then, as sunlight; red-angry is our Hope\r\n      grown now, as consuming fire. But, O Heavens, what enchantment is\r\n      it, or devilish legerdemain, of such effect, that Perfect\r\n      Felicity, always within arm’s length, could never be laid hold\r\n      of, but only in her stead Controversy and Scarcity? This set of\r\n      traitors after that set! Tremble, ye traitors; dread a People\r\n      which calls itself patient, long-suffering; but which cannot\r\n      always submit to have its pocket picked, in this way,—of a\r\n      Millennium!\r\n\r\n      Yes, Reader, here is a miracle. Out of that putrescent rubbish of\r\n      Scepticism, Sensualism, Sentimentalism, hollow Machiavelism, such\r\n      a Faith has verily risen; flaming in the heart of a People. A\r\n      whole People, awakening as it were to consciousness in deep\r\n      misery, believes that it is within reach of a Fraternal\r\n      Heaven-on-Earth. With longing arms, it struggles to embrace the\r\n      Unspeakable; cannot embrace it, owing to certain causes.—Seldom\r\n      do we find that a whole People can be said to have any Faith at\r\n      all; except in things which it can eat and handle. Whensoever it\r\n      gets any Faith, its history becomes spirit-stirring, note-worthy.\r\n      But since the time when steel Europe shook itself simultaneously,\r\n      at the word of Hermit Peter, and rushed towards the Sepulchre\r\n      where God had lain, there was no universal impulse of Faith that\r\n      one could note. Since Protestantism went silent, no Luther’s\r\n      voice, no Zisca’s drum any longer proclaiming that God’s Truth\r\n      was _not_ the Devil’s Lie; and the last of the Cameronians\r\n      (Renwick was the name of him; honour to the name of the brave!)\r\n      sank, shot, on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh, there was no partial\r\n      impulse of Faith among Nations. Till now, behold, once more this\r\n      French Nation believes! Herein, we say, in that astonishing Faith\r\n      of theirs, lies the miracle. It is a Faith undoubtedly of the\r\n      more prodigious sort, even among Faiths; and will embody itself\r\n      in prodigies. It is the soul of that world-prodigy named French\r\n      Revolution; whereat the world still gazes and shudders.\r\n\r\n      But, for the rest, let no man ask History to explain by\r\n      cause-and-effect how the business proceeded henceforth. This\r\n      battle of Mountain and Gironde, and what follows, is the battle\r\n      of Fanaticisms and Miracles; unsuitable for cause-and-effect. The\r\n      sound of it, to the mind, is as a hubbub of voices in\r\n      distraction; little of articulate is to be gathered by long\r\n      listening and studying; only battle-tumult, shouts of triumph,\r\n      shrieks of despair. The Mountain has left no Memoirs; the\r\n      Girondins have left Memoirs, which are too often little other\r\n      than long-drawn Interjections, of _Woe is me and Cursed be ye_.\r\n      So soon as History can philosophically delineate the\r\n      conflagration of a kindled Fireship, she may try this other task.\r\n      Here lay the bitumen-stratum, there the brimstone one; so ran the\r\n      vein of gunpowder, of nitre, terebinth and foul grease: this,\r\n      were she inquisitive enough, History might partly know. But how\r\n      they acted and reacted below decks, one fire-stratum playing into\r\n      the other, by its nature and the art of man, now when all hands\r\n      ran raging, and the flames lashed high over shrouds and topmast:\r\n      this let not History attempt.\r\n\r\n      The Fireship is old France, the old French Form of Life; her\r\n      creed a Generation of men. Wild are their cries and their ragings\r\n      there, like spirits tormented in that flame. But, on the whole,\r\n      are they not _gone_, O Reader? Their Fireship and they,\r\n      frightening the world, have sailed away; its flames and its\r\n      thunders quite away, into the Deep of Time. One thing therefore\r\n      History will do: pity them all; for it went hard with them all.\r\n      Not even the seagreen Incorruptible but shall have some pity,\r\n      some human love, though it takes an effort. And now, so much once\r\n      thoroughly attained, the rest will become easier. To the eye of\r\n      equal brotherly pity, innumerable perversions dissipate\r\n      themselves; exaggerations and execrations fall off, of their own\r\n      accord. Standing wistfully on the safe shore, we will look, and\r\n      see, what is of interest to us, what is adapted to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.II.\r\n      Culottic and Sansculottic.\r\n\r\n      Gironde and Mountain are now in full quarrel; their mutual rage,\r\n      says Toulongeon, is growing a “pale” rage. Curious, lamentable:\r\n      all these men have the word Republic on their lips; in the heart\r\n      of every one of them is a passionate wish for something which he\r\n      calls Republic: yet see their death-quarrel! So, however, are men\r\n      made. Creatures who live in confusion; who, once thrown together,\r\n      can readily fall into that confusion of confusions which quarrel\r\n      is, simply because their confusions differ from one another;\r\n      still more because they seem to differ! Men’s words are a poor\r\n      exponent of their thought; nay their thought itself is a poor\r\n      exponent of the inward unnamed Mystery, wherefrom both thought\r\n      and action have their birth. No man can explain himself, can get\r\n      himself explained; men see not one another but distorted\r\n      phantasms which they call one another; which they hate and go to\r\n      battle with: for all battle is well said to be\r\n      _misunderstanding_.\r\n\r\n      But indeed that similitude of the Fireship; of our poor French\r\n      brethren, so fiery themselves, working also in an _element_ of\r\n      fire, was not insignificant. Consider it well, there is a shade\r\n      of the truth in it. For a man, once committed headlong to\r\n      republican or any other Transcendentalism, and fighting and\r\n      fanaticising amid a Nation of his like, becomes as it were\r\n      enveloped in an ambient atmosphere of Transcendentalism and\r\n      Delirium: his individual self is lost in something that is not\r\n      himself, but foreign though inseparable from him. Strange to\r\n      think of, the man’s cloak still seems to hold the same man: and\r\n      yet the man is not there, his volition is not there; nor the\r\n      source of what he will do and devise; instead of the man and his\r\n      volition there is a piece of Fanaticism and Fatalism incarnated\r\n      in the shape of him. He, the hapless incarnated Fanaticism, goes\r\n      his road; no man can help him, he himself least of all. It is a\r\n      wonderful tragical predicament;—such as human language, unused to\r\n      deal with these things, being contrived for the uses of common\r\n      life, struggles to shadow out in figures. The ambient element of\r\n      material fire is not wilder than this of Fanaticism; nor, though\r\n      visible to the eye, is it more real. Volition bursts forth\r\n      involuntary; rapt along; the movement of free human minds becomes\r\n      a raging tornado of fatalism, blind as the winds; and Mountain\r\n      and Gironde, when they recover themselves, are alike astounded to\r\n      see _where_ it has flung and dropt them. To such height of\r\n      miracle can men work on men; the Conscious and the Unconscious\r\n      blended inscrutably in this our inscrutable Life; endless\r\n      Necessity environing Freewill!\r\n\r\n      The weapons of the Girondins are Political Philosophy,\r\n      Respectability and Eloquence. Eloquence, or call it rhetoric,\r\n      really of a superior order; Vergniaud, for instance, turns a\r\n      period as sweetly as any man of that generation. The weapons of\r\n      the Mountain are those of mere nature: Audacity and Impetuosity\r\n      which may become Ferocity, as of men complete in their\r\n      determination, in their conviction; nay of men, in some cases,\r\n      who as Septemberers must either prevail or perish. The ground to\r\n      be fought for is Popularity: further you may either seek\r\n      Popularity with the friends of Freedom and Order, or with the\r\n      friends of Freedom Simple; to seek it with both has unhappily\r\n      become impossible. With the former sort, and generally with the\r\n      Authorities of the Departments, and such as read Parliamentary\r\n      Debates, and are of Respectability, and of a peace-loving monied\r\n      nature, the Girondins carry it. With the extreme Patriot again,\r\n      with the indigent millions, especially with the Population of\r\n      Paris who do not read so much as hear and see, the Girondins\r\n      altogether lose it, and the Mountain carries it.\r\n\r\n      Egoism, nor meanness of mind, is not wanting on either side.\r\n      Surely not on the Girondin side; where in fact the instinct of\r\n      self-preservation, too prominently unfolded by circumstances,\r\n      cuts almost a sorry figure; where also a certain finesse, to the\r\n      length even of shuffling and shamming, now and then shews itself.\r\n      They are men skilful in Advocate-fence. They have been called the\r\n      Jesuits of the Revolution;[613] but that is too hard a name. It\r\n      must be owned likewise that this rude blustering Mountain has a\r\n      sense in it of what the Revolution means; which these eloquent\r\n      Girondins are totally void of. Was the Revolution made, and\r\n      fought for, against the world, these four weary years, that a\r\n      Formula might be substantiated; that Society might become\r\n      _methodic_, demonstrable by logic; and the old Noblesse with\r\n      their pretensions vanish? Or ought it not withal to bring some\r\n      glimmering of light and alleviation to the Twenty-five Millions,\r\n      who sat in darkness, heavy-laden, till they rose with pikes in\r\n      their hands? At least and lowest, one would think, it should\r\n      bring them a proportion of bread to live on? There is in the\r\n      Mountain here and there; in Marat People’s-friend; in the\r\n      incorruptible Seagreen himself, though otherwise so lean and\r\n      formularly, a heartfelt knowledge of this latter fact;—without\r\n      which knowledge all other knowledge here is naught, and the\r\n      choicest forensic eloquence is as sounding brass and a tinkling\r\n      cymbal. Most cold, on the other hand, most patronising,\r\n      unsubstantial is the tone of the Girondins towards “our poorer\r\n      brethren;”—those brethren whom one often hears of under the\r\n      collective name of “the masses,” as if they were not persons at\r\n      all, but mounds of combustible explosive material, for blowing\r\n      down Bastilles with! In very truth, a Revolutionist of this kind,\r\n      is he not a Solecism? Disowned by Nature and Art; deserving only\r\n      to be erased, and disappear! Surely, to our poorer brethren of\r\n      Paris, all this Girondin patronage sounds deadening and killing:\r\n      if fine-spoken and incontrovertible in logic, then all the\r\n      falser, all the hatefuller in fact.\r\n\r\n      Nay doubtless, pleading for Popularity, here among our poorer\r\n      brethren of Paris, the Girondin has a hard game to play. If he\r\n      gain the ear of the Respectable at a distance, it is by insisting\r\n      on September and such like; it is at the expense of this Paris\r\n      where he dwells and perorates. Hard to perorate in such an\r\n      auditory! Wherefore the question arises: Could we not get\r\n      ourselves out of this Paris? Twice or oftener such an attempt is\r\n      made. If not we ourselves, thinks Guadet, then at least our\r\n      _Suppléans_ might do it. For every Deputy has his _Suppléant_, or\r\n      Substitute, who will take his place if need be: might not these\r\n      assemble, say at Bourges, which is a quiet episcopal Town, in\r\n      quiet Berri, forty good leagues off? In that case, what profit\r\n      were it for the Paris Sansculottery to insult us; our _Suppléans_\r\n      sitting quiet in Bourges, to whom we could run? Nay even the\r\n      Primary electoral Assemblies, thinks Guadet, might be reconvoked,\r\n      and a New Convention got, with new orders from the Sovereign\r\n      people; and right glad were Lyons, were Bourdeaux, Rouen,\r\n      Marseilles, as yet Provincial Towns, to welcome us in their turn,\r\n      and become a sort of Capital Towns; and teach these Parisians\r\n      reason.\r\n\r\n      Fond schemes; which all misgo! If decreed, in heat of eloquent\r\n      logic, today, they are repealed, by clamour, and passionate wider\r\n      considerations, on the morrow.[614] Will you, O Girondins, parcel\r\n      us into separate Republics, then; like the Swiss, like your\r\n      Americans; so that there be no Metropolis or indivisible French\r\n      Nation any more? Your Departmental Guard seemed to point that\r\n      way! Federal Republic? Federalist? Men and Knitting-women repeat\r\n      _Fédéraliste_, with or without much Dictionary-meaning; but go on\r\n      repeating it, as is usual in such cases, till the meaning of it\r\n      becomes almost magical, fit to designate all mystery of Iniquity;\r\n      and _Fédéraliste_ has grown a word of Exorcism and\r\n      _Apage-Satanas_. But furthermore, consider what “poisoning of\r\n      public opinion” in the Departments, by these Brissot, Gorsas,\r\n      Caritat-Condorcet Newspapers! And then also what\r\n      counter-poisoning, still feller in quality, by a _Père Duchesne_\r\n      of Hébert, brutallest Newspaper yet published on Earth; by a\r\n      _Rougiff_ of Guffroy; by the “incendiary leaves of Marat!” More\r\n      than once, on complaint given and effervescence rising, it is\r\n      decreed that a man cannot both be Legislator and Editor; that he\r\n      shall choose between the one function and the other.[615] But\r\n      this too, which indeed could help little, is revoked or eluded;\r\n      remains a pious wish mainly.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, as the sad fruit of such strife, behold, O ye National\r\n      Representatives, how between the friends of Law and the friends\r\n      of Freedom everywhere, mere heats and jealousies have arisen;\r\n      fevering the whole Republic! Department, Provincial Town is set\r\n      against Metropolis, Rich against Poor, Culottic against\r\n      Sansculottic, man against man. From the Southern Cities come\r\n      Addresses of an almost inculpatory character; for Paris has long\r\n      suffered Newspaper calumny. Bourdeaux demands a reign of Law and\r\n      Respectability, meaning Girondism, with emphasis. With emphasis\r\n      Marseilles demands the like. Nay from Marseilles there come _two_\r\n      Addresses: one Girondin; one Jacobin Sansculottic. Hot Rebecqui,\r\n      sick of this Convention-work, has given place to his Substitute,\r\n      and gone home; where also, with such jarrings, there is work to\r\n      be sick of.\r\n\r\n      Lyons, a place of Capitalists and Aristocrats, is in still worse\r\n      state; almost in revolt. Chalier the Jacobin Town-Councillor has\r\n      got, too literally, to daggers-drawn with Nièvre-Chol the\r\n      _Modératin_ Mayor; one of your Moderate, perhaps Aristocrat,\r\n      Royalist or Federalist Mayors! Chalier, who pilgrimed to Paris\r\n      “to behold Marat and the Mountain,” has verily kindled himself at\r\n      their sacred urn: for on the 6th of February last, History or\r\n      Rumour has seen him haranguing his Lyons Jacobins in a quite\r\n      transcendental manner, with a drawn dagger in his hand;\r\n      recommending (they say) sheer September-methods, patience being\r\n      worn out; and that the Jacobin Brethren should, impromptu, work\r\n      the Guillotine themselves! One sees him still, in Engravings:\r\n      mounted on a table; foot advanced, body contorted; a bald, rude,\r\n      slope-browed, infuriated visage of the canine species, the eyes\r\n      starting from their sockets; in his puissant right-hand the\r\n      brandished dagger, or horse-pistol, as some give it; other\r\n      dog-visages kindling under him:—a man not likely to end well!\r\n      However, the Guillotine was _not_ got together impromptu, that\r\n      day, “on the Pont Saint-Clair,” or elsewhere; but indeed\r\n      continued lying rusty in its loft:[616] Nièvre-Chol with military\r\n      went about, rumbling cannon, in the most confused manner; and the\r\n      “nine hundred prisoners” received no hurt. So distracted is Lyons\r\n      grown, with its cannon rumbling. Convention Commissioners must be\r\n      sent thither forthwith: if even they can appease it, and keep the\r\n      Guillotine in its loft?\r\n\r\n      Consider finally if, on all these mad jarrings of the Southern\r\n      Cities, and of France generally, a traitorous Crypto-Royalist\r\n      class is not looking and watching; ready to strike in, at the\r\n      right season! Neither is there bread; neither is there soap: see\r\n      the Patriot women selling out sugar, at a just rate of twenty-two\r\n      sous per pound! Citizen Representatives, it were verily well that\r\n      your quarrels finished, and the reign of Perfect Felicity began.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.III.\r\n      Growing Shrill.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, one cannot say that the Girondins are wanting to\r\n      themselves, so far as good-will might go. They prick assiduously\r\n      into the sore-places of the Mountain; from principle, and also\r\n      from jesuitism.\r\n\r\n      Besides September, of which there is now little to be made except\r\n      effervescence, we discern two sore-places where the Mountain\r\n      often suffers: Marat and Orléans Egalité. Squalid Marat, for his\r\n      own sake and for the Mountain’s, is assaulted ever and anon; held\r\n      up to France, as a squalid bloodthirsty Portent, inciting to the\r\n      pillage of shops; of whom let the Mountain have the credit! The\r\n      Mountain murmurs, ill at ease: this “Maximum of Patriotism,” how\r\n      shall they either own him or disown him? As for Marat personally,\r\n      he, with his fixed-idea, remains invulnerable to such things: nay\r\n      the People’s-friend is very evidently rising in importance, as\r\n      his befriended People rises. No shrieks now, when he goes to\r\n      speak; occasional applauses rather, furtherance which breeds\r\n      confidence. The day when the Girondins proposed to “decree him\r\n      accused” (_décréter d’accusation_, as they phrase it) for that\r\n      February Paragraph, of “hanging up a Forestaller or two at the\r\n      door-lintels,” Marat proposes to have _them_ “decreed insane;”\r\n      and, descending the Tribune-steps, is heard to articulate these\r\n      most unsenatorial ejaculations: ‘_Les Cochons, les imbecilles_,\r\n      Pigs, idiots!’ Oftentimes he croaks harsh sarcasm, having really\r\n      a rough rasping tongue, and a very deep fund of contempt for fine\r\n      outsides; and once or twice, he even laughs, nay “explodes into\r\n      laughter, _rit aux éclats_,” at the gentilities and superfine\r\n      airs of these Girondin ‘men of statesmanship,’ with their\r\n      pedantries, plausibilities, pusillanimities: ‘these two years,’\r\n      says he, ‘you have been whining about attacks, and plots, and\r\n      danger from Paris; and you have not a scratch to shew for\r\n      yourselves.’[617]—Danton gruffly rebukes him, from time to time:\r\n      a Maximum of Patriotism, whom one can neither own nor disown!\r\n\r\n      But the second sore-place of the Mountain is this anomalous\r\n      Monseigneur Equality Prince d’Orléans. Behold these men, says the\r\n      Gironde; with a whilom Bourbon Prince among them: they are\r\n      creatures of the D’Orléans Faction; they will have Philippe made\r\n      King; one King no sooner guillotined than another made in his\r\n      stead! Girondins have moved, Buzot moved long ago, from principle\r\n      and also from jesuitism, that the whole race of Bourbons should\r\n      be marched forth from the soil of France; this Prince Egalité to\r\n      bring up the rear. Motions which might produce some effect on the\r\n      public;—which the Mountain, ill at ease, knows not what to do\r\n      with.\r\n\r\n      And poor Orléans Egalité himself, for one begins to pity even\r\n      him, what does he do with them? The disowned of all parties, the\r\n      rejected and foolishly be-drifted hither and hither, to what\r\n      corner of Nature can he now drift with advantage? Feasible hope\r\n      remains not for him: unfeasible hope, in pallid doubtful\r\n      glimmers, there may still come, bewildering, not cheering or\r\n      illuminating,—from the Dumouriez quarter; and how, if not the\r\n      timewasted Orléans Egalité, then perhaps the young unworn\r\n      Chartres Egalité might rise to be a kind of King? Sheltered, if\r\n      shelter it be, in the clefts of the Mountain, poor Egalité will\r\n      wait: one refuge in Jacobinism, one in Dumouriez and\r\n      Counter-Revolution, are there not two chances? However, the look\r\n      of him, Dame Genlis says, is grown gloomy; sad to see. Sillery\r\n      also, the Genlis’s Husband, who hovers about the Mountain, not on\r\n      it, is in a bad way. Dame Genlis has come to Raincy, out of\r\n      England and Bury St. Edmunds, in these days; being summoned by\r\n      Egalité, with her young charge, Mademoiselle Egalité, that so\r\n      Mademoiselle might not be counted among Emigrants and hardly\r\n      dealt with. But it proves a ravelled business: Genlis and charge\r\n      find that they must retire to the Netherlands; must wait on the\r\n      Frontiers for a week or two; till Monseigneur, by Jacobin help,\r\n      get it wound up. “Next morning,” says Dame Genlis, “Monseigneur,\r\n      gloomier than ever, gave me his arm, to lead me to the carriage.\r\n      I was greatly troubled; Mademoiselle burst into tears; her Father\r\n      was pale and trembling. After I had got seated, he stood\r\n      immovable at the carriage-door, with his eyes fixed on me; his\r\n      mournful and painful look seemed to implore pity;—‘_Adieu,\r\n      Madame!_’ said he. The altered sound of his voice completely\r\n      overcame me; not able to utter a word, I held out my hand; he\r\n      grasped it close; then turning, and advancing sharply towards the\r\n      postillions, he gave them a sign, and we rolled away.”[618]\r\n\r\n      Nor are Peace-makers wanting; of whom likewise we mention two;\r\n      one fast on the crown of the Mountain, the other not yet alighted\r\n      anywhere: Danton and Barrère. Ingenious Barrère, Old-Constituent\r\n      and Editor from the slopes of the Pyrenees, is one of the\r\n      usefullest men of this Convention, in his way. Truth may lie on\r\n      both sides, on either side, or on neither side; my friends, ye\r\n      must give and take: for the rest, success to the winning side!\r\n      This is the motto of Barrère. Ingenious, almost genial;\r\n      quick-sighted, supple, graceful; a man that will prosper.\r\n      Scarcely Belial in the assembled Pandemonium was plausibler to\r\n      ear and eye. An indispensable man: in the great _Art of Varnish_\r\n      he may be said to seek his fellow. Has there an explosion arisen,\r\n      as many do arise, a confusion, unsightliness, which no tongue can\r\n      speak of, nor eye look on; give it to Barrère; Barrère shall be\r\n      Committee-Reporter of it; you shall see it transmute itself into\r\n      a regularity, into the very beauty and improvement that was\r\n      needed. Without one such man, we say, how were this Convention\r\n      bested? Call him not, as exaggerative Mercier does, “the greatest\r\n      liar in France:” nay it may be argued there is not truth enough\r\n      in him to make a real lie of. Call him, with Burke, Anacreon of\r\n      the Guillotine, and a man serviceable to this Convention.\r\n\r\n      The other Peace-maker whom we name is Danton. Peace, O peace with\r\n      one another! cries Danton often enough: Are we not alone against\r\n      the world; a little band of brothers? Broad Danton is loved by\r\n      all the Mountain; but they think him too easy-tempered, deficient\r\n      in suspicion: he has stood between Dumouriez and much censure,\r\n      anxious not to exasperate our only General: in the shrill tumult\r\n      Danton’s strong voice reverberates, for union and pacification.\r\n      Meetings there are; dinings with the Girondins: it is so\r\n      pressingly essential that there be union. But the Girondins are\r\n      haughty and respectable; this Titan Danton is not a man of\r\n      Formulas, and there rests on him a shadow of September. ‘Your\r\n      Girondins have no confidence in me:’ this is the answer a\r\n      conciliatory Meillan gets from him; to all the arguments and\r\n      pleadings this conciliatory Meillan can bring, the repeated\r\n      answer is, ‘_Ils n’ont point de confiance_.’[619]—The tumult will\r\n      get ever shriller; rage is growing pale.\r\n\r\n      In fact, what a pang is it to the heart of a Girondin, this first\r\n      withering probability that the despicable unphilosophic anarchic\r\n      Mountain, after all, may triumph! Brutal Septemberers, a\r\n      fifth-floor Tallien, “a Robespierre without an idea in his head,”\r\n      as Condorcet says, “or a feeling in his heart:” and yet we, the\r\n      flower of France, cannot stand against them; behold the sceptre\r\n      departs from us; from us and goes to them! Eloquence,\r\n      Philosophism, Respectability avail not: “against Stupidity the\r\n      very gods fight to no purpose,\r\n\r\n      “Mit der Dummheit kämpfen Götter selbst vergebens!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Shrill are the plaints of Louvet; his thin existence all\r\n      acidified into rage, and preternatural insight of suspicion.\r\n      Wroth is young Barbaroux; wroth and scornful. Silent, like a\r\n      Queen with the aspic on her bosom, sits the wife of Roland;\r\n      Roland’s Accounts never yet got audited, his name become a\r\n      byword. Such is the fortune of war, especially of revolution. The\r\n      great gulf of Tophet, and Tenth of August, opened itself at the\r\n      magic of your eloquent voice; and lo now, it will not close at\r\n      your voice! It is a dangerous thing such magic. The Magician’s\r\n      Famulus got hold of the forbidden Book, and summoned a goblin:\r\n      _Plait-il_, What is your will? said the Goblin. The Famulus,\r\n      somewhat struck, bade him fetch water: the swift goblin fetched\r\n      it, pail in each hand; but lo, would not cease fetching it!\r\n      Desperate, the Famulus shrieks at him, smites at him, cuts him in\r\n      two; lo, _two_ goblin water-carriers ply; and the house will be\r\n      swum away in Deucalion Deluges.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.IV.\r\n      Fatherland in Danger.\r\n\r\n      Or rather we will say, this Senatorial war might have lasted\r\n      long; and Party tugging and throttling with Party might have\r\n      suppressed and smothered one another, in the ordinary bloodless\r\n      Parliamentary way; on one condition: that France had been at\r\n      least able to exist, all the while. But this Sovereign People has\r\n      a digestive faculty, and cannot do without bread. Also we are at\r\n      war, and must have victory; at war with Europe, with Fate and\r\n      Famine: and behold, in the spring of the year, all victory\r\n      deserts us.\r\n\r\n      Dumouriez had his outposts stretched as far as Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\n      and the beautifullest plan for pouncing on Holland, by stratagem,\r\n      flat-bottomed boats and rapid intrepidity; wherein too he had\r\n      prospered so far; but unhappily could prosper no further.\r\n      Aix-la-Chapelle is lost; Maestricht will not surrender to mere\r\n      smoke and noise: the flat-bottomed boats must launch themselves\r\n      again, and return the way they came. Steady now, ye rapidly\r\n      intrepid men; retreat with firmness, Parthian-like! Alas, were it\r\n      General Miranda’s fault; were it the War-minister’s fault; or\r\n      were it Dumouriez’s own fault and that of Fortune: enough, there\r\n      is nothing for it but retreat,—well if it be not even flight; for\r\n      already terror-stricken cohorts and stragglers pour off, not\r\n      waiting for order; flow disastrous, as many as ten thousand of\r\n      them, without halt till they see France again.[620] Nay worse:\r\n      Dumouriez himself is perhaps secretly turning traitor? Very sharp\r\n      is the tone in which he writes to our Committees. Commissioners\r\n      and Jacobin Pillagers have done such incalculable mischief;\r\n      Hassenfratz sends neither cartridges nor clothing; shoes we have,\r\n      deceptively “soled with wood and pasteboard.” Nothing in short is\r\n      right. Danton and Lacroix, when it was they that were\r\n      Commissioners, would needs join Belgium to France;—of which\r\n      Dumouriez might have made the prettiest little Duchy for his own\r\n      secret behoof! With all these things the General is wroth; and\r\n      writes to us in a sharp tone. Who knows what this hot little\r\n      General is meditating? Dumouriez Duke of Belgium or Brabant; and\r\n      say, Egalité the Younger King of France: there were an end for\r\n      our Revolution!—Committee of Defence gazes, and shakes its head:\r\n      who except Danton, defective in suspicion, could still struggle\r\n      to be of hope?\r\n\r\n      And General Custine is rolling back from the Rhine Country;\r\n      conquered Mentz will be reconquered, the Prussians gathering\r\n      round to bombard it with shot and shell. Mentz may resist,\r\n      Commissioner Merlin, the Thionviller, “making sallies, at the\r\n      head of the besieged;”—resist to the death; but not longer than\r\n      that. How sad a reverse for Mentz! Brave Foster, brave Lux\r\n      planted Liberty-trees, amid _ça-ira_-ing music, in the snow-slush\r\n      of last winter, there: and made Jacobin Societies; and got the\r\n      Territory incorporated with France: they came hither to Paris, as\r\n      Deputies or Delegates, and have their eighteen francs a-day: but\r\n      see, before once the Liberty-Tree is got rightly in leaf, Mentz\r\n      is changing into an explosive crater; vomiting fire, bevomited\r\n      with fire!\r\n\r\n      Neither of these men shall again see Mentz; they have come hither\r\n      only to die. Foster has been round the Globe; he saw Cook perish\r\n      under Owyhee clubs; but like this Paris he has yet seen or\r\n      suffered nothing. Poverty escorts him: from home there can\r\n      nothing come, except Job’s-news; the eighteen daily francs, which\r\n      we here as Deputy or Delegate with difficulty “touch,” are in\r\n      paper _assignats_, and sink fast in value. Poverty,\r\n      disappointment, inaction, obloquy; the brave heart slowly\r\n      breaking! Such is Foster’s lot. For the rest, Demoiselle\r\n      Théroigne smiles on you in the Soirees; “a beautiful brownlocked\r\n      face,” of an exalted temper; and contrives to keep her carriage.\r\n      Prussian Trenck, the poor subterranean Baron, jargons and jangles\r\n      in an unmelodious manner. Thomas Paine’s face is red-pustuled,\r\n      “but the eyes uncommonly bright.” Convention Deputies ask you to\r\n      dinner: very courteous; and “we all play at _plumsack_.”[621] “It\r\n      is the Explosion and New-creation of a World,” says Foster; “and\r\n      the actors in it, such small mean objects, buzzing round one like\r\n      a handful of flies.”—\r\n\r\n      Likewise there is war with Spain. Spain will advance through the\r\n      gorges of the Pyrenees; rustling with Bourbon banners; jingling\r\n      with artillery and menace. And England has donned the red coat;\r\n      and marches, with Royal Highness of York,—whom some once spake of\r\n      inviting to be our King. Changed that humour now: and ever more\r\n      changing; till no hatefuller thing walk this Earth than a denizen\r\n      of that tyrannous Island; and Pitt be declared and decreed, with\r\n      effervescence, “_L’ennemi du genre humain_, The enemy of\r\n      mankind;” and, very singular to say, you make an order that no\r\n      Soldier of Liberty give quarter to an Englishman. Which order\r\n      however, the Soldier of Liberty does but partially obey. We will\r\n      take no Prisoners then, say the Soldiers of Liberty; they shall\r\n      all be “Deserters” that we take.[622] It is a frantic order; and\r\n      attended with inconvenience. For surely, if you give no quarter,\r\n      the plain issue is that you will get none; and so the business\r\n      become as broad as it was long.—Our “recruitment of Three Hundred\r\n      Thousand men,” which was the decreed force for this year, is like\r\n      to have work enough laid to its hand.\r\n\r\n      So many enemies come wending on; penetrating through throats of\r\n      Mountains, steering over the salt sea; towards all points of our\r\n      territory; rattling chains at us. Nay worst of all: there is an\r\n      enemy within our own territory itself. In the early days of\r\n      March, the Nantes Postbags do not arrive; there arrive only\r\n      instead of them Conjecture, Apprehension, bodeful wind of Rumour.\r\n      The bodefullest proves true! Those fanatic Peoples of La Vendée\r\n      will no longer keep under: their fire of insurrection, heretofore\r\n      dissipated with difficulty, blazes out anew, after the King’s\r\n      Death, as a wide conflagration; not riot, but civil war. Your\r\n      Cathelineaus, your Stofflets, Charettes, are other men than was\r\n      thought: behold how their Peasants, in mere russet and hodden,\r\n      with their rude arms, rude array, with their fanatic Gaelic\r\n      frenzy and wild-yelling battle-cry of _God and the King_, dash at\r\n      us like a dark whirlwind; and blow the best-disciplined Nationals\r\n      we can get into panic and _sauve-qui-peut!_ Field after field is\r\n      theirs; one sees not where it will end. Commandant Santerre may\r\n      be sent thither; but with non-effect; he might as well have\r\n      returned and brewed beer.\r\n\r\n      It has become peremptorily necessary that a National Convention\r\n      cease arguing, and begin acting. Yield one party of you to the\r\n      other, and do it swiftly. No theoretic outlook is here, but the\r\n      close certainty of ruin; the very day that is passing over must\r\n      be provided for.\r\n\r\n      It was Friday the eighth of March when this Job’s-post from\r\n      Dumouriez, thickly preceded and escorted by so many other\r\n      Job’s-posts, reached the National Convention. Blank enough are\r\n      most faces. Little will it avail whether our Septemberers be\r\n      punished or go unpunished; if Pitt and Cobourg are coming in,\r\n      with one punishment for us all; nothing now between Paris itself\r\n      and the Tyrants but a doubtful Dumouriez, and hosts in\r\n      loose-flowing loud retreat!—Danton the Titan rises in this hour,\r\n      as always in the hour of need. Great is his voice, reverberating\r\n      from the domes:—Citizen-Representatives, shall we not, in such\r\n      crisis of Fate, lay aside discords? Reputation: O what is the\r\n      reputation of this man or of that? _Que mon nom soit flétri, que\r\n      la France soit libre_, Let my name be blighted; let France be\r\n      free! It is necessary now again that France rise, in swift\r\n      vengeance, with her million right-hands, with her heart as of one\r\n      man. Instantaneous recruitment in Paris; let every Section of\r\n      Paris furnish its thousands; every section of France! Ninety-six\r\n      Commissioners of us, two for each Section of the Forty-eight,\r\n      they must go forthwith, and tell Paris what the Country needs of\r\n      her. Let Eighty more of us be sent, post-haste, over France; to\r\n      spread the fire-cross, to call forth the might of men. Let the\r\n      Eighty also be on the road, before this sitting rise. Let them\r\n      go, and think what their errand is. Speedy Camp of Fifty thousand\r\n      between Paris and the North Frontier; for Paris will pour forth\r\n      her volunteers! Shoulder to shoulder; one strong universal\r\n      death-defiant rising and rushing; we shall hurl back these Sons\r\n      of Night yet again; and France, in spite of the world, be\r\n      free![623]—So sounds the Titan’s voice: into all Section-houses;\r\n      into all French hearts. Sections sit in Permanence, for\r\n      recruitment, enrolment, that very night. Convention\r\n      Commissioners, on swift wheels, are carrying the fire-cross from\r\n      Town to Town, till all France blaze.\r\n\r\n      And so there is Flag of _Fatherland in Danger_ waving from the\r\n      Townhall, Black Flag from the top of Notre-Dame Cathedral; there\r\n      is Proclamation, hot eloquence; Paris rushing out once again to\r\n      strike its enemies down. That, in such circumstances, Paris was\r\n      in no mild humour can be conjectured. Agitated streets; still\r\n      more agitated round the Salle de Manége! Feuillans-Terrace crowds\r\n      itself with angry Citizens, angrier Citizenesses; Varlet\r\n      perambulates with portable-chair: ejaculations of no measured\r\n      kind, as to perfidious fine-spoken _Hommes d’état_, friends of\r\n      Dumouriez, secret-friends of Pitt and Cobourg, burst from the\r\n      hearts and lips of men. To fight the enemy? Yes, and even to\r\n      ‘freeze him with terror, _glacer d’effroi;_’ but first to have\r\n      domestic Traitors punished! Who are they that, carping and\r\n      quarrelling, in their jesuitic most _moderate_ way, seek to\r\n      shackle the Patriotic movement? That divide France against Paris,\r\n      and poison public opinion in the Departments? That when we ask\r\n      for bread, and a Maximum fixed-price, treat us with lectures on\r\n      Free-trade in grains? Can the human stomach satisfy itself with\r\n      lectures on Free-trade; and are we to fight the Austrians in a\r\n      moderate manner, or in an immoderate? This Convention must be\r\n      _purged_.\r\n\r\n      ‘Set up a swift Tribunal for Traitors, a Maximum for Grains:’\r\n      thus speak with energy the Patriot Volunteers, as they defile\r\n      through the Convention Hall, just on the wing to the\r\n      Frontiers;—perorating in that heroical Cambyses’ vein of theirs:\r\n      beshouted by the Galleries and Mountain; bemurmured by the\r\n      Right-side and Plain. Nor are prodigies wanting: lo, while a\r\n      Captain of the Section Poissonnière perorates with vehemence\r\n      about Dumouriez, Maximum, and Crypto-Royalist Traitors, and his\r\n      troop beat chorus with him, waving their Banner overhead, the eye\r\n      of a Deputy discerns, in this same Banner, that the _cravates_ or\r\n      streamers of it have Royal fleurs-de-lys! The Section-Captain\r\n      shrieks; his troop shriek, horror-struck, and “trample the Banner\r\n      under foot:” seemingly the work of some Crypto-Royalist Plotter?\r\n      Most probable;[62]—or perhaps at bottom, only the _old_ Banner of\r\n      the Section, manufactured prior to the Tenth of August, when such\r\n      streamers were according to rule![625]\r\n\r\n      History, looking over the Girondin Memoirs, anxious to\r\n      disentangle the truth of them from the hysterics, finds these\r\n      days of March, especially this Sunday the Tenth of March, play a\r\n      great part. Plots, plots: a plot for murdering the Girondin\r\n      Deputies; Anarchists and Secret-Royalists plotting, in hellish\r\n      concert, for that end! The far greater part of which is\r\n      hysterics. What we do find indisputable is that Louvet and\r\n      certain Girondins were apprehensive they might be murdered on\r\n      Saturday, and did not go to the evening sitting: but held council\r\n      with one another, each inciting his fellow to do something\r\n      resolute, and end these Anarchists: to which, however, Pétion,\r\n      opening the window, and finding the night very wet, answered\r\n      only, ‘_Ils ne feront rien_,’ and “composedly resumed his\r\n      violin,” says Louvet:[626] thereby, with soft Lydian\r\n      tweedledeeing, to wrap himself against eating cares. Also that\r\n      Louvet felt especially liable to being killed; that several\r\n      Girondins went abroad to seek beds: liable to being killed; but\r\n      were not. Further that, in very truth, Journalist Deputy Gorsas,\r\n      poisoner of the Departments, he and his Printer had their houses\r\n      broken into (by a tumult of Patriots, among whom red-capped\r\n      Varlet, American Fournier loom forth, in the darkness of the rain\r\n      and riot); had their wives put in fear; their presses, types and\r\n      circumjacent equipments beaten to ruin; no Mayor interfering in\r\n      time; Gorsas himself escaping, pistol in hand, “along the coping\r\n      of the back wall.” Further that Sunday, the morrow, was not a\r\n      workday; and the streets were more agitated than ever: Is it a\r\n      new September, then, that these Anarchists intend? Finally, that\r\n      no September came;—and also that hysterics, not unnaturally, had\r\n      reached almost their acme.[627]\r\n\r\n      Vergniaud denounces and deplores; in sweetly turned periods.\r\n      Section Bonconseil, _Good-counsel_ so-named, not Mauconseil or\r\n      _Ill-counsel_ as it once was,—does a far notabler thing: demands\r\n      that Vergniaud, Brissot, Guadet, and other denunciatory\r\n      fine-spoken Girondins, to the number of Twenty-two, be put under\r\n      arrest! Section Good-counsel, so named ever since the Tenth of\r\n      August, is sharply rebuked, like a Section of Ill-counsel;[628]\r\n      but its word is spoken, and will not fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n      In fact, one thing strikes us in these poor Girondins; their\r\n      fatal shortness of vision; nay fatal poorness of character, for\r\n      that is the root of it. They are as strangers to the People they\r\n      would govern; to the thing they have come to work in. Formulas,\r\n      Philosophies, Respectabilities, what has been written in Books,\r\n      and admitted by the Cultivated Classes; _this_ inadequate\r\n      _Scheme_ of Nature’s working is all that Nature, let her work as\r\n      she will, can reveal to these men. So they perorate and\r\n      speculate; and call on the Friends of Law, when the question is\r\n      not Law or No-Law, but Life or No-Life. Pedants of the\r\n      Revolution, if not Jesuits of it! Their Formalism is great; great\r\n      also is their Egoism. France rising to fight Austria has been\r\n      raised only by Plot of the Tenth of March, to kill Twenty-two of\r\n      _them!_ This Revolution Prodigy, unfolding itself into terrific\r\n      stature and articulation, by its own laws and Nature’s, not by\r\n      the laws of Formula, has become unintelligible, incredible as an\r\n      impossibility, the waste chaos of a Dream.” A Republic founded on\r\n      what they call the Virtues; on what we call the Decencies and\r\n      Respectabilities: this they will have, and nothing but this.\r\n      Whatsoever other Republic Nature and Reality send, shall be\r\n      considered as not sent; as a kind of Nightmare Vision, and thing\r\n      non-extant; disowned by the Laws of Nature, and of Formula. Alas!\r\n      Dim for the best eyes is this Reality; and as for these men, they\r\n      will not look at it with eyes at all, but only through “facetted\r\n      spectacles” of Pedantry, wounded Vanity; which yield the most\r\n      portentous fallacious spectrum. Carping and complaining forever\r\n      of Plots and Anarchy, they will do one thing: prove, to\r\n      demonstration, that the Reality will not translate into their\r\n      Formula; that they and their Formula are incompatible with the\r\n      Reality: and, in its dark wrath, the Reality will extinguish it\r\n      and them! What a man _kens_ he _cans_. But the beginning of a\r\n      man’s doom is that vision be withdrawn from him; that he see not\r\n      the reality, but a false spectrum of the reality; and, following\r\n      that, step darkly, with more or less velocity, downwards to the\r\n      utter Dark; to Ruin, which is the great Sea of Darkness, whither\r\n      all falsehoods, winding or direct, continually flow!\r\n\r\n      This Tenth of March we may mark as an epoch in the Girondin\r\n      destinies; the rage so exasperated itself, the misconception so\r\n      darkened itself. Many desert the sittings; many come to them\r\n      armed.[629] An honourable Deputy, setting out after breakfast,\r\n      must now, besides taking his Notes, see whether his Priming is in\r\n      order.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile with Dumouriez in Belgium it fares ever worse. Were it\r\n      again General Miranda’s fault, or some other’s fault, there is no\r\n      doubt whatever but the “Battle of Nerwinden,” on the 18th of\r\n      March, is lost; and our rapid retreat has become a far too rapid\r\n      one. Victorious Cobourg, with his Austrian prickers, hangs like a\r\n      dark cloud on the rear of us: Dumouriez never off horseback night\r\n      or day; engagement every three hours; our whole discomfited Host\r\n      rolling rapidly inwards, full of rage, suspicion, and\r\n      _sauve-qui-peut!_ And then Dumouriez himself, what his intents\r\n      may be? Wicked seemingly and not charitable! His despatches to\r\n      Committee openly denounce a factious Convention, for the woes it\r\n      has brought on France and him. And his speeches—for the General\r\n      has no reticence! The Execution of the Tyrant this Dumouriez\r\n      calls the Murder of the King. Danton and Lacroix, flying thither\r\n      as Commissioners once more, return very doubtful; even Danton now\r\n      doubts.\r\n\r\n      Three Jacobin Missionaries, Proly, Dubuisson, Pereyra, have flown\r\n      forth; sped by a wakeful Mother Society: they are struck dumb to\r\n      hear the General speak. The Convention, according to this\r\n      General, consists of three hundred scoundrels and four hundred\r\n      imbeciles: France cannot do without a King. ‘But we have executed\r\n      our King.’ ‘And what is it to me,’ hastily cries Dumouriez, a\r\n      General of no reticence, ‘whether the King’s name be _Ludovicus_\r\n      or _Jacobus?_’ ‘Or _Philippus!_’ rejoins Proly;—and hastens to\r\n      report progress. Over the Frontiers such hope is there.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.V.\r\n      Sansculottism Accoutred.\r\n\r\n      Let us look, however, at the grand internal Sansculottism and\r\n      Revolution Prodigy, whether it stirs and waxes: there and not\r\n      elsewhere hope may still be for France. The Revolution Prodigy,\r\n      as Decree after Decree issues from the Mountain, like creative\r\n      _fiats_, accordant with the nature of the Thing,—is shaping\r\n      itself rapidly, in these days, into terrific stature and\r\n      articulation, limb after limb. Last March, 1792, we saw all\r\n      France flowing in blind terror; shutting town-barriers, boiling\r\n      pitch for Brigands: happier, this March, that it is a seeing\r\n      terror; that a creative Mountain exists, which can say _fiat!_\r\n      Recruitment proceeds with fierce celerity: nevertheless our\r\n      Volunteers hesitate to set out, till Treason be punished at home;\r\n      they do not fly to the frontiers; but only fly hither and\r\n      thither, demanding and denouncing. The Mountain must speak new\r\n      _fiat_, and new _fiats_.\r\n\r\n      And does it not speak such? Take, as first example, those\r\n      _Comités Révolutionnaires_ for the arrestment of Persons Suspect.\r\n      Revolutionary Committee, of Twelve chosen Patriots, sits in every\r\n      Township of France; examining the Suspect, seeking arms, making\r\n      domiciliary visits and arrestments;—caring, generally, that the\r\n      Republic suffer no detriment. Chosen by universal suffrage, each\r\n      in its Section, they are a kind of elixir of Jacobinism; some\r\n      Forty-four Thousand of them awake and alive over France! In Paris\r\n      and all Towns, every house-door must have the names of the\r\n      inmates legibly printed on it, “at a height not exceeding five\r\n      feet from the ground;” every Citizen must produce his\r\n      certificatory _Carte de Civisme_, signed by Section-President;\r\n      every man be ready to give account of the faith that is in him.\r\n      Persons Suspect had as well depart this soil of Liberty! And yet\r\n      departure too is bad: all Emigrants are declared Traitors, their\r\n      property become National; they are “dead in Law,”—save indeed\r\n      that for _our_ behoof they shall “live yet fifty years in Law,”\r\n      and what heritages may fall to them in that time become National\r\n      too! A mad vitality of Jacobinism, with Forty-four Thousand\r\n      centres of activity, circulates through all fibres of France.\r\n\r\n      Very notable also is the _Tribunal Extraordinaire:_[630] decreed\r\n      by the Mountain; some Girondins dissenting, for surely such a\r\n      Court contradicts every formula;—other Girondins assenting, nay\r\n      co-operating, for do not we all hate Traitors, O ye people of\r\n      Paris?—Tribunal of the Seventeenth in Autumn last was swift; but\r\n      this shall be swifter. Five Judges; a standing Jury, which is\r\n      named from Paris and the Neighbourhood, that there be not delay\r\n      in naming it: they are subject to no Appeal; to hardly any\r\n      Law-forms, but must “get themselves convinced” in all readiest\r\n      ways; and for security are bound “to vote audibly;” audibly, in\r\n      the hearing of a Paris Public. This is the _Tribunal\r\n      Extraordinaire;_ which, in few months, getting into most lively\r\n      action, shall be entitled _Tribunal Revolutionnaire;_ as indeed\r\n      it from the very first has entitled itself: with a Herman or a\r\n      Dumas for Judge President, with a Fouquier-Tinville for\r\n      Attorney-General, and a Jury of such as Citizen Leroi, who has\r\n      surnamed himself _Dix-Août_, “Leroi _August-Tenth_,” it will\r\n      become the wonder of the world. Herein has Sansculottism\r\n      fashioned for itself a Sword of Sharpness: a weapon magical;\r\n      tempered in the Stygian hell-waters; to the edge of it all\r\n      armour, and defence of strength or of cunning shall be soft; it\r\n      shall mow down Lives and Brazen-gates; and the waving of it shed\r\n      terror through the souls of men.\r\n\r\n      But speaking of an amorphous Sansculottism taking form, ought we\r\n      not above all things to specify how the Amorphous gets itself a\r\n      Head? Without metaphor, this Revolution Government continues\r\n      hitherto in a very anarchic state. Executive Council of\r\n      Ministers, Six in number, there is; but they, especially since\r\n      Roland’s retreat, have hardly known whether they were Ministers\r\n      or not. Convention Committees sit supreme over them; but then\r\n      each Committee as supreme as the others: Committee of Twenty-one,\r\n      of Defence, of General Surety; simultaneous or successive, for\r\n      specific purposes. The Convention alone is\r\n      all-powerful,—especially if the Commune go with it; but is too\r\n      numerous for an administrative body. Wherefore, in this perilous\r\n      quick-whirling condition of the Republic, before the end of\r\n      March, we obtain our small _Comité de Salut Public;_[631] as it\r\n      were, for miscellaneous accidental purposes, requiring\r\n      despatch;—as it proves, for a sort of universal supervision, and\r\n      universal subjection. They are to report weekly, these new\r\n      Committee-men; but to deliberate in secret. Their number is Nine,\r\n      firm Patriots all, Danton one of them: Renewable every month;—yet\r\n      why not reelect them if they turn out well? The flower of the\r\n      matter is that they are but nine; that they sit in secret. An\r\n      insignificant-looking thing at first, this Committee; but with a\r\n      principle of growth in it! Forwarded by fortune, by internal\r\n      Jacobin energy, it will reduce all Committees and the Convention\r\n      itself to mute obedience, the Six Ministers to Six assiduous\r\n      Clerks; and work its will on the Earth and under Heaven, for a\r\n      season. “A Committee of Public Salvation,” whereat the world\r\n      still shrieks and shudders.\r\n\r\n      If we call that Revolutionary Tribunal a Sword, which\r\n      Sansculottism has provided for itself, then let us call the “Law\r\n      of the Maximum,” a Provender-scrip, or Haversack, wherein better\r\n      or worse some ration of bread may be found. It is true, Political\r\n      Economy, Girondin free-trade, and all law of supply and demand,\r\n      are hereby hurled topsyturvy: but what help? Patriotism must\r\n      live; the “cupidity of farmers” seems to have no bowels.\r\n      Wherefore this Law of the Maximum, fixing the highest price of\r\n      grains, is, with infinite effort, got passed;[632] and shall\r\n      gradually extend itself into a Maximum for all manner of\r\n      _comestibles_ and commodities: with such scrambling and\r\n      topsyturvying as may be fancied! For now, if, for example, the\r\n      farmer will not sell? The farmer shall be forced to sell. An\r\n      accurate Account of what grain he has shall be delivered in to\r\n      the Constituted Authorities: let him see that he say not too\r\n      much; for in that case, his rents, taxes and contributions will\r\n      rise proportionally: let him see that he say not too little; for,\r\n      on or before a set day, we shall suppose in April, _less_ than\r\n      one-third of this declared quantity, must remain in his barns,\r\n      more than two-thirds of it must have been thrashed and sold. One\r\n      can denounce him, and raise penalties.\r\n\r\n      By such inextricable overturning of all Commercial relation will\r\n      Sansculottism keep life in; since not otherwise. On the whole, as\r\n      Camille Desmoulins says once, ‘while the Sansculottes fight, the\r\n      Monsieurs must pay.’ So there come _Impôts Progressifs_,\r\n      Ascending Taxes; which consume, with fast-increasing voracity,\r\n      and “superfluous-revenue’ of men: beyond fifty-pounds a-year you\r\n      are not exempt; rising into the hundreds you bleed freely; into\r\n      the thousands and tens of thousands, you bleed gushing. Also\r\n      there come Requisitions; there comes “Forced-Loan of a Milliard,”\r\n      some Fifty-Millions Sterling; which of course they that _have_\r\n      must lend. Unexampled enough: it has grown to be no country for\r\n      the Rich, this; but a country for the Poor! And then if one fly,\r\n      what steads it? Dead in Law; nay kept alive fifty years yet, for\r\n      _their_ accursed behoof! In this manner, therefore, it goes;\r\n      topsyturvying, _ça-ira_-ing;—and withal there is endless sale of\r\n      Emigrant National-Property, there is Cambon with endless\r\n      cornucopia of Assignats. The Trade and Finance of Sansculottism;\r\n      and how, with Maximum and Bakers’-queues, with Cupidity, Hunger,\r\n      Denunciation and Paper-money, it led its galvanic-life, and began\r\n      and ended,—remains the most interesting of all Chapters in\r\n      Political Economy: still to be written.\r\n\r\n      All which things are they not clean against Formula? O Girondin\r\n      Friends, it is not a Republic of the Virtues we are getting; but\r\n      only a Republic of the Strengths, virtuous and other!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.VI.\r\n      The Traitor.\r\n\r\n      But Dumouriez, with his fugitive Host, with his King _Ludovicus_\r\n      or King _Philippus?_ There lies the crisis; there hangs the\r\n      question: Revolution Prodigy, or Counter-Revolution?—One wide\r\n      shriek covers that North-East region. Soldiers, full of rage,\r\n      suspicion and terror, flock hither and thither; Dumouriez the\r\n      many-counselled, never off horseback, knows now no counsel that\r\n      were not worse than none: the counsel, namely, of joining himself\r\n      with Cobourg; marching to Paris, extinguishing Jacobinism, and,\r\n      with some new King Ludovicus or King Philippus, resting the\r\n      Constitution of 1791![633]\r\n\r\n      Is Wisdom quitting Dumouriez; the herald of Fortune quitting him?\r\n      Principle, faith political or other, beyond a certain faith of\r\n      mess-rooms, and honour of an officer, had him not to quit. At any\r\n      rate, his quarters in the Burgh of Saint-Amand; his headquarters\r\n      in the Village of Saint-Amand des Boues, a short way off,—have\r\n      become a Bedlam. National Representatives, Jacobin Missionaries\r\n      are riding and running: of the “three Towns,” Lille, Valenciennes\r\n      or even Condé, which Dumouriez wanted to snatch for himself, not\r\n      one can be snatched: your Captain is admitted, but the Town-gate\r\n      is closed on him, and then the Prison gate, and “his men wander\r\n      about the ramparts.” Couriers gallop breathless; men wait, or\r\n      seem waiting, to assassinate, to be assassinated; Battalions nigh\r\n      frantic with such suspicion and uncertainty, with\r\n      _Vive-la-République_ and _Sauve-qui-peut_, rush this way and\r\n      that;—Ruin and Desperation in the shape of Cobourg lying\r\n      entrenched close by.\r\n\r\n      Dame Genlis and her fair Princess d’Orléans find this Burgh of\r\n      Saint-Amand no fit place for them; Dumouriez’s protection is\r\n      grown worse than none. Tough Genlis one of the toughest women; a\r\n      woman, as it were, with nine lives in her; whom nothing will\r\n      beat: she packs her bandboxes; clear for flight in a private\r\n      manner. Her beloved Princess she will—leave here, with the Prince\r\n      Chartres Egalité her Brother. In the cold grey of the April\r\n      morning, we find her accordingly established in her hired\r\n      vehicle, on the street of Saint-Amand; postilions just cracking\r\n      their whips to go,—when behold the young Princely Brother,\r\n      struggling hitherward, hastily calling; bearing the Princess in\r\n      his arms! Hastily he has clutched the poor young lady up, in her\r\n      very night-gown, nothing saved of her goods except the watch from\r\n      the pillow: with brotherly despair he flings her in, among the\r\n      bandboxes, into Genlis’s chaise, into Genlis’s arms: Leave her\r\n      not, in the name of Mercy and Heaven! A shrill scene, but a brief\r\n      one:—the postilions crack and go. Ah, whither? Through by-roads\r\n      and broken hill-passes: seeking their way with lanterns after\r\n      nightfall; through perils, and Cobourg Austrians, and suspicious\r\n      French Nationals; finally, into Switzerland; safe though nigh\r\n      moneyless.[634] The brave young Egalité has a most wild Morrow to\r\n      look for; but now only himself to carry through it.\r\n\r\n      For indeed over at that Village named _of the Mudbaths_,\r\n      Saint-Amand des Boues, matters are still worse. About four\r\n      o’clock on Tuesday afternoon, the 2d of April 1793, two Couriers\r\n      come galloping as if for life: _Mon Général!_ Four National\r\n      Representatives, War-Minister at their head, are posting\r\n      hitherward, from Valenciennes: are close at hand,—with what\r\n      intents one may guess! While the Couriers are yet speaking,\r\n      War-Minister and National Representatives, old Camus the\r\n      Archivist for chief speaker of them, arrive. Hardly has _Mon\r\n      Général_ had time to order out the Huzzar Regiment de Berchigny;\r\n      that it take rank and wait near by, in case of accident. And so,\r\n      enter War-Minister Beurnonville, with an embrace of friendship,\r\n      for he is an old friend; enter Archivist Camus and the other\r\n      three, following him.\r\n\r\n      They produce Papers, invite the General to the bar of the\r\n      Convention: merely to give an explanation or two. The General\r\n      finds it unsuitable, not to say impossible, and that ‘the service\r\n      will suffer.’ Then comes reasoning; the voice of the old\r\n      Archivist getting loud. Vain to reason loud with this Dumouriez;\r\n      he answers mere angry irreverences. And so, amid plumed\r\n      staff-officers, very gloomy-looking; in jeopardy and uncertainty,\r\n      these poor National messengers debate and consult, retire and\r\n      re-enter, for the space of some two hours: without effect.\r\n      Whereupon Archivist Camus, getting quite loud, proclaims, in the\r\n      name of the National Convention, for he has the power to do it,\r\n      That General Dumouriez is _arrested:_ ‘Will you obey the National\r\n      Mandate, General!’ ‘_Pas dans ce moment-ci_, Not at this\r\n      particular moment,’ answers the General also aloud; then glancing\r\n      the other way, utters certain unknown vocables, in a mandatory\r\n      manner; seemingly a German word-of-command.[635] Hussars clutch\r\n      the Four National Representatives, and Beurnonville the\r\n      War-minister; pack them out of the apartment; out of the Village,\r\n      over the lines to Cobourg, in two chaises that very night,—as\r\n      hostages, prisoners; to lie long in Maestricht and Austrian\r\n      strongholds![636] J_acta est alea_.\r\n\r\n      This night Dumouriez prints his “Proclamation;” this night and\r\n      the morrow the Dumouriez Army, in such darkness visible, and rage\r\n      of semi-desperation as there is, shall meditate what the General\r\n      is doing, what they themselves will do in it. Judge whether this\r\n      Wednesday was of halcyon nature, for any one! But, on the\r\n      Thursday morning, we discern Dumouriez with small escort, with\r\n      Chartres Egalité and a few staff-officers, ambling along the\r\n      Condé Highway: perhaps they are for Condé, and trying to persuade\r\n      the Garrison there; at all events, they are for an interview with\r\n      Cobourg, who waits in the woods by appointment, in that quarter.\r\n      Nigh the Village of Doumet, three National Battalions, a set of\r\n      men always full of Jacobinism, sweep past us; marching rather\r\n      swiftly,—seemingly in mistake, by a way we had not ordered. The\r\n      General dismounts, steps into a cottage, a little from the\r\n      wayside; will give them right order in writing. Hark! what\r\n      strange growling is heard: what barkings are heard, loud yells of\r\n      ‘_Traitors_,’ of ‘_Arrest:_’ the National Battalions have wheeled\r\n      round, are emitting shot! Mount, Dumouriez, and spring for life!\r\n      Dumouriez and Staff strike the spurs in, deep; vault over\r\n      ditches, into the fields, which prove to be morasses; sprawl and\r\n      plunge for life; bewhistled with curses and lead. Sunk to the\r\n      middle, with or without horses, several servants killed, they\r\n      escape out of shot-range, to General Mack the Austrian’s\r\n      quarters. Nay they return on the morrow, to Saint-Amand and\r\n      faithful foreign Berchigny; but what boots it? The Artillery has\r\n      all revolted, is jingling off to Valenciennes: all have revolted,\r\n      are revolting; except only foreign Berchigny, to the extent of\r\n      some poor fifteen hundred, none will follow Dumouriez against\r\n      France and Indivisible Republic: Dumouriez’s occupation’s\r\n      gone.[637]\r\n\r\n      Such an instinct of Frenehhood and Sansculottism dwells in these\r\n      men: they will follow no Dumouriez nor Lafayette, nor any mortal\r\n      on such errand. Shriek may be of _Sauve-qui-peut_, but will also\r\n      be of _Vive-la-République_. New National Representatives arrive;\r\n      new General Dampierre, soon killed in battle; new General\r\n      Custine; the agitated Hosts draw back to some Camp of Famars;\r\n      make head against Cobourg as they can.\r\n\r\n      And so Dumouriez is in the Austrian quarters; his drama ended, in\r\n      this rather sorry manner. A most shifty, wiry man; one of\r\n      Heaven’s Swiss that wanted only work. Fifty years of unnoticed\r\n      toil and valour; one year of toil and valour, not unnoticed, but\r\n      seen of all countries and centuries; then thirty other years\r\n      again unnoticed, of Memoir-writing, English Pension, scheming and\r\n      projecting to no purpose: Adieu thou Swiss of Heaven, worthy to\r\n      have been something else!\r\n\r\n      His Staff go different ways. Brave young Egalité reaches\r\n      Switzerland and the Genlis Cottage; with a strong crabstick in\r\n      his hand, a strong heart in his body: his Princedom in now\r\n      reduced to that. Egalité the Father sat playing whist, in his\r\n      Palais Egalité, at Paris, on the 6th day of this same month of\r\n      April, when a catchpole entered: Citoyen Egalité is wanted at the\r\n      Convention Committee![638] Examination, requiring Arrestment;\r\n      finally requiring Imprisonment, transference to Marseilles and\r\n      the Castle of If! Orléansdom has sunk in the black waters; Palais\r\n      Egalité, which was Palais Royal, is like to become Palais\r\n      National.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.VII.\r\n      In Fight.\r\n\r\n      Our Republic, by paper Decree, may be “One and Indivisible;” but\r\n      what profits it while these things are? Federalists in the\r\n      Senate, renegadoes in the Army, traitors everywhere! France, all\r\n      in desperate recruitment since the Tenth of March, does not fly\r\n      to the frontier, but only flies hither and thither. This\r\n      defection of contemptuous diplomatic Dumouriez falls heavy on the\r\n      fine-spoken high-sniffing _Hommes d’état_, whom he consorted\r\n      with; forms a second epoch in their destinies.\r\n\r\n      Or perhaps more strictly we might say, the second Girondin epoch,\r\n      though little noticed then, began on the day when, in reference\r\n      to this defection, the Girondins broke with Danton. It was the\r\n      first day of April; Dumouriez had not yet plunged across the\r\n      morasses to Cobourg, but was evidently meaning to do it, and our\r\n      Commissioners were off to arrest him; when what does the Girondin\r\n      Lasource see good to do, but rise, and jesuitically question and\r\n      insinuate at great length, whether a main accomplice of Dumouriez\r\n      had not probably been—Danton? Gironde grins sardonic assent;\r\n      Mountain holds its breath. The figure of Danton, Levasseur says,\r\n      while this speech went on, was noteworthy. He sat erect, with a\r\n      kind of internal convulsion struggling to keep itself motionless;\r\n      his eye from time to time flashing wilder, his lip curling in\r\n      Titanic scorn.[639] Lasource, in a fine-spoken attorney-manner,\r\n      proceeds: there is this probability to his mind, and there is\r\n      that; probabilities which press painfully on him, which cast the\r\n      Patriotism of Danton under a painful shade; which painful shade\r\n      he, Lasource, will hope that Danton may find it not impossible to\r\n      dispel.\r\n\r\n      ‘_Les Scélérats!_’ cries Danton, starting up, with clenched\r\n      right-hand, Lasource having done: and descends from the Mountain,\r\n      like a lava-flood; his answer not unready. Lasource’s\r\n      probabilities fly like idle dust; but leave a result behind them.\r\n      ‘Ye were right, friends of the Mountain,’ begins Danton, ‘and I\r\n      was wrong: there is no peace possible with these men. Let it be\r\n      war then! They will not save the Republic with us: it shall be\r\n      saved without them; saved in spite of them.’ Really a burst of\r\n      rude Parliamentary eloquence this; which is still worth reading,\r\n      in the old _Moniteur!_ With fire-words the exasperated rude Titan\r\n      rives and smites these Girondins; at every hit the glad Mountain\r\n      utters chorus: Marat, like a musical _bis_, repeating the last\r\n      phrase.[640] Lasource’s probabilities are gone: but Danton’s\r\n      pledge of battle remains lying.\r\n\r\n      A third epoch, or scene in the Girondin Drama, or rather it is\r\n      but the completion of this second epoch, we reckon from the day\r\n      when the patience of virtuous Pétion finally boiled over; and the\r\n      Girondins, so to speak, took up this battle-pledge of Danton’s\r\n      and decreed Marat accused. It was the eleventh of the same month\r\n      of April, on some effervescence rising, such as often rose; and\r\n      President had covered himself, mere Bedlam now ruling; and\r\n      Mountain and Gironde were rushing on one another with clenched\r\n      right-hands, and even with pistols in them; when, behold, the\r\n      Girondin Duperret drew a sword! Shriek of horror rose, instantly\r\n      quenching all other effervescence, at sight of the clear\r\n      murderous steel; whereupon Duperret returned it to the leather\r\n      again;—confessing that he did indeed draw it, being instigated by\r\n      a kind of sacred madness, ‘_sainte fureur_,’ and pistols held at\r\n      him; but that if he parricidally had chanced to scratch the\r\n      outmost skin of National Representation with it, he too carried\r\n      pistols, and would have blown his brains out on the spot.[641]\r\n\r\n      But now in such posture of affairs, virtuous Pétion rose, next\r\n      morning, to lament these effervescences, this endless Anarchy\r\n      invading the Legislative Sanctuary itself; and here, being\r\n      growled at and howled at by the Mountain, his patience, long\r\n      tried, did, as we say, boil over; and he spake vehemently, in\r\n      high key, with foam on his lips; “whence,” says Marat, “I\r\n      concluded he had got “_la rage_,” the rabidity, or dog-madness.\r\n      Rabidity smites others rabid: so there rises new foam-lipped\r\n      demand to have Anarchists extinguished; and specially to have\r\n      Marat put under Accusation. Send a Representative to the\r\n      Revolutionary Tribunal? Violate the inviolability of a\r\n      Representative? Have a care, O Friends! This poor Marat has\r\n      faults enough; but against Liberty or Equality, what fault? That\r\n      he has loved and fought for it, not wisely but too well. In\r\n      dungeons and cellars, in pinching poverty, under anathema of men;\r\n      even so, in such fight, has he grown so dingy, bleared; even so\r\n      has his head become a Stylites one! Him you will fling to your\r\n      Sword of Sharpness; while Cobourg and Pitt advance on us,\r\n      fire-spitting?\r\n\r\n      The Mountain is loud, the Gironde is loud and deaf; all lips are\r\n      foamy. With “Permanent-Session of twenty-four hours,” with vote\r\n      by rollcall, and a dead-lift effort, the Gironde carries it:\r\n      Marat is ordered to the Revolutionary Tribunal, to answer for\r\n      that February Paragraph of Forestallers at the door-lintel, with\r\n      other offences; and, after a little hesitation, he obeys.[642]\r\n\r\n      Thus is Danton’s battle-pledge taken up: there is, as he said\r\n      there would be, “war without truce or treaty, _ni trève ni\r\n      composition_.” Wherefore, close now with one another, Formula and\r\n      Reality, in death-grips, and wrestle it out; both of you cannot\r\n      live, but only one!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.VIII.\r\n      In Death-Grips.\r\n\r\n      It proves what strength, were it only of inertia, there is in\r\n      established Formulas, what weakness in nascent Realities, and\r\n      illustrates several things, that this death-wrestle should still\r\n      have lasted some six weeks or more. National business, discussion\r\n      of the Constitutional Act, for our Constitution should decidedly\r\n      be got ready, proceeds along with it. We even change our\r\n      Locality; we shift, on the Tenth of May, from the old Salle de\r\n      Manége, into our new Hall, in the Palace, once a King’s but now\r\n      the Republic’s, of the Tuileries. Hope and ruth, flickering\r\n      against despair and rage, still struggles in the minds of men.\r\n\r\n      It is a most dark confused death-wrestle, this of the six weeks.\r\n      Formalist frenzy against Realist frenzy; Patriotism, Egoism,\r\n      Pride, Anger, Vanity, Hope and Despair, all raised to the\r\n      frenetic pitch: Frenzy meets Frenzy, like dark clashing\r\n      whirlwinds; neither understands the other; the weaker, one day,\r\n      will understand that _it_ is verily swept down! Girondism is\r\n      strong as established Formula and Respectability: do not as many\r\n      as Seventy-two of the Departments, or say respectable Heads of\r\n      Departments, declare for us? Calvados, which loves its Buzot,\r\n      will even rise in revolt, so hint the Addresses; Marseilles,\r\n      cradle of Patriotism, will rise; Bourdeaux will rise, and the\r\n      Gironde Department, as one man; in a word, who will _not_ rise,\r\n      were our _Représentation Nationale_ to be insulted, or one hair\r\n      of a Deputy’s head harmed! The Mountain, again, is strong as\r\n      Reality and Audacity. To the Reality of the Mountain are not all\r\n      furthersome things possible? A new Tenth of August, if needful;\r\n      nay a new Second of September!—\r\n\r\n      But, on Wednesday afternoon, twenty-fourth day of April, year\r\n      1793, what tumult as of fierce jubilee is this? It is Marat\r\n      returning from Revolutionary Tribunal! A week or more of\r\n      death-peril: and now there is triumphant acquittal; Revolutionary\r\n      Tribunal can find no accusation against this man. And so the eye\r\n      of History beholds Patriotism, which had gloomed unutterable\r\n      things all week, break into loud jubilee, embrace its Marat; lift\r\n      him into a chair of triumph, bear him shoulder-high through the\r\n      streets. Shoulder-high is the injured People’s-friend, crowned\r\n      with an oak-garland; amid the wavy sea of red nightcaps,\r\n      carmagnole jackets, grenadier bonnets and female mob-caps;\r\n      far-sounding like a sea! The injured People’s-friend has here\r\n      reached his culminating-point; he too strikes the stars with his\r\n      sublime head.\r\n\r\n      But the Reader can judge with what face President Lasource, he of\r\n      the “painful probabilities,” who presides in this Convention\r\n      Hall, might welcome such jubilee-tide, when it got thither, and\r\n      the Decreed of Accusation floating on the top of it! A National\r\n      Sapper, spokesman on the occasion, says, the People know their\r\n      Friend, and love his life as their own; ‘whosoever wants Marat’s\r\n      head must get the Sapper’s first.’[643] Lasource answered with\r\n      some vague painful mumblement,—which, says Levasseur, one could\r\n      not help tittering at.[644] Patriot Sections, Volunteers not yet\r\n      gone to the Frontiers, come demanding the ‘purgation of traitors\r\n      from your own bosom;’ the expulsion, or even the trial and\r\n      sentence, of a factious Twenty-two.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless the Gironde has got its Commission of Twelve; a\r\n      Commission specially appointed for investigating these troubles\r\n      of the Legislative Sanctuary: let Sansculottism say what it will,\r\n      Law shall triumph. Old-Constituent Rabaut Saint-Etienne presides\r\n      over this Commission: ‘it is the last plank whereon a wrecked\r\n      Republic may perhaps still save herself.’ Rabaut and they\r\n      therefore sit, intent; examining witnesses; launching\r\n      arrestments; looking out into a waste dim sea of troubles.—the\r\n      womb of _Formula_, or perhaps her grave! Enter not that sea, O\r\n      Reader! There are dim desolation and confusion; raging women and\r\n      raging men. Sections come demanding Twenty-two; for the _number_\r\n      first given by Section Bonconseil still holds, though the names\r\n      should even vary. Other Sections, of the wealthier kind, come\r\n      denouncing such demand; nay the same Section will demand today,\r\n      and denounce the demand tomorrow, according as the wealthier sit,\r\n      or the poorer. Wherefore, indeed, the Girondins decree that all\r\n      Sections shall close “at ten in the evening;” before the working\r\n      people come: which Decree remains without effect. And nightly the\r\n      Mother of Patriotism wails doleful; doleful, but her eye\r\n      kindling! And Fournier l’Americain is busy, and the two Banker\r\n      Freys, and Varlet Apostle of Liberty; the bull-voice of Marquis\r\n      Saint-Huruge is heard. And shrill women vociferate from all\r\n      Galleries, the Convention ones and downwards. Nay a “Central\r\n      Committee” of all the Forty-eight Sections, looms forth huge and\r\n      dubious; sitting dim in the _Archevêché_, sending Resolutions,\r\n      receiving them: a Centre of the Sections; in dread deliberation\r\n      as to a New Tenth of August!\r\n\r\n      One thing we will specify to throw light on many: the aspect\r\n      under which, seen through the eyes of these Girondin Twelve, or\r\n      even seen through one’s own eyes, the Patriotism of the softer\r\n      sex presents itself. There are Female Patriots, whom the\r\n      Girondins call Megaeras, and count to the extent of eight\r\n      thousand; with serpent-hair, all out of curl; who have changed\r\n      the distaff for the dagger. They are of “the Society called\r\n      Brotherly,” _Fraternelle_, say _Sisterly_, which meets under the\r\n      roof of the Jacobins. “Two thousand daggers,” or so, have been\r\n      ordered,—doubtless, for them. They rush to Versailles, to raise\r\n      more women; but the Versailles women will not rise.[645]\r\n\r\n      Nay, behold, in National Garden of Tuileries,—Demoiselle\r\n      Théroigne herself is become as a brownlocked Diana (were that\r\n      possible) attacked by her own dogs, or she-dogs! The Demoiselle,\r\n      keeping her carriage, is for Liberty indeed, as she has full well\r\n      shewn; but then for Liberty with Respectability: whereupon these\r\n      serpent-haired Extreme She-Patriots now do fasten on her, tatter\r\n      her, shamefully fustigate her, in their shameful way; almost\r\n      fling her into the Garden-ponds, had not help intervened. Help,\r\n      alas, to small purpose. The poor Demoiselle’s head and\r\n      nervous-system, none of the soundest, is so tattered and\r\n      fluttered that it will never recover; but flutter worse and\r\n      worse, till it crack; and within year and day we hear of her in\r\n      madhouse, and straitwaistcoat, which proves permanent!—Such\r\n      brownlocked Figure did flutter, and inarticulately jabber and\r\n      gesticulate, little able to _speak_ the obscure meaning it had,\r\n      through some segment of that Eighteenth Century of Time. She\r\n      disappears here from the Revolution and Public History, for\r\n      evermore.[646]\r\n\r\n      Another thing we will not again specify, yet again beseech the\r\n      Reader to imagine: the reign of Fraternity and Perfection.\r\n      Imagine, we say, O Reader, that the Millennium were struggling on\r\n      the threshold, and yet not so much as groceries could be\r\n      had,—owing to traitors. With what impetus would a man strike\r\n      traitors, in that case? Ah, thou canst not imagine it: thou hast\r\n      thy groceries safe in the shops, and little or no hope of a\r\n      Millennium ever coming!—But, indeed, as to the temper there was\r\n      in men and women, does not this one fact say enough: the height\r\n      SUSPICION had risen to? Preternatural we often called it;\r\n      seemingly in the language of exaggeration: but listen to the cold\r\n      deposition of witnesses. Not a musical Patriot can blow himself a\r\n      snatch of melody from the French Horn, sitting mildly pensive on\r\n      the housetop, but Mercier will recognise it to be a signal which\r\n      one Plotting Committee is making to another. Distraction has\r\n      possessed Harmony herself; lurks in the sound of _Marseillese_\r\n      and _ça-ira_.[647] Louvet, who can see as deep into a millstone\r\n      as the most, discerns that we shall be invited back to our old\r\n      Hall of the Manege, by a Deputation; and then the Anarchists will\r\n      massacre Twenty-two of us, as we walk over. It is Pitt and\r\n      Cobourg; the gold of Pitt.—Poor Pitt! They little know what work\r\n      he has with his own Friends of the People; getting them bespied,\r\n      beheaded, their habeas-corpuses suspended, and his own Social\r\n      Order and strong-boxes kept tight,—to fancy him raising mobs\r\n      among his neighbours!\r\n\r\n      But the strangest fact connected with French or indeed with human\r\n      Suspicion, is perhaps this of Camille Desmoulins. Camille’s head,\r\n      one of the clearest in France, has got itself so saturated\r\n      through every fibre with Preternaturalism of Suspicion, that\r\n      looking back on that Twelfth of July 1789, when the thousands\r\n      rose round him, yelling responsive at his word in the Palais\r\n      Royal Garden, and took cockades, he finds it explicable only on\r\n      this hypothesis, That they were all hired to do it, and set on by\r\n      the Foreign and other Plotters. “It was not for nothing,” says\r\n      Camille with insight, “that this multitude burst up round me when\r\n      I spoke!” No, not for nothing. Behind, around, before, it is one\r\n      huge Preternatural Puppet-play of Plots; Pitt pulling the\r\n      wires.[648] Almost I conjecture that I Camille myself am a Plot,\r\n      and wooden with wires.—The force of insight could no further go.\r\n\r\n      Be this as it will, History remarks that the Commission of\r\n      Twelve, now clear enough as to the Plots; and luckily having “got\r\n      the threads of them all by the end,” as they say,—are launching\r\n      Mandates of Arrest rapidly in these May days; and carrying\r\n      matters with a high hand; resolute that the sea of troubles shall\r\n      be restrained. What chief Patriot, Section-President even, is\r\n      safe? They can arrest him; tear him from his warm bed, because he\r\n      has made irregular Section Arrestments! They arrest Varlet\r\n      Apostle of Liberty. They arrest Procureur-Substitute Hébert,\r\n      _Père Duchesne;_ a Magistrate of the People, sitting in Townhall;\r\n      who, with high solemnity of martyrdom, takes leave of his\r\n      colleagues; prompt he, to obey the Law; and solemnly acquiescent,\r\n      disappears into prison.\r\n\r\n      The swifter fly the Sections, energetically demanding him back;\r\n      demanding not arrestment of Popular Magistrates, but of a\r\n      traitorous Twenty-two. Section comes flying after\r\n      Section;—defiling energetic, with their Cambyses’ vein of\r\n      oratory: nay the Commune itself comes, with Mayor Pache at its\r\n      head; and with question not of Hébert and the Twenty-two alone,\r\n      but with this ominous old question made new, ‘Can you save the\r\n      Republic, or must we do it?’ To whom President Max Isnard makes\r\n      fiery answer: If by fatal chance, in any of those tumults which\r\n      since the Tenth of March are ever returning, Paris were to lift a\r\n      sacrilegious finger against the National Representation, France\r\n      would rise as one man, in never-imagined vengeance, and shortly\r\n      ‘the traveller would ask, on which side of the Seine Paris had\r\n      stood!’[649] Whereat the Mountain bellows only louder, and every\r\n      Gallery; Patriot Paris boiling round.\r\n\r\n      And Girondin Valazé has nightly conclaves at his house; sends\r\n      billets; “Come punctually, and well armed, for there is to be\r\n      business.” And Megaera women perambulate the streets, with flags,\r\n      with lamentable _alleleu_.[650] And the Convention-doors are\r\n      obstructed by roaring multitudes: find-spoken _Hommes d’état_ are\r\n      hustled, maltreated, as they pass; Marat will apostrophise you,\r\n      in such death-peril, and say, Thou too art of them. If Roland ask\r\n      leave to quit Paris, there is order of the day. What help?\r\n      Substitute Hébert, Apostle Varlet, must be given back; to be\r\n      crowned with oak-garlands. The Commission of Twelve, in a\r\n      Convention overwhelmed with roaring Sections, is broken; then on\r\n      the morrow, in a Convention of rallied Girondins, is reinstated.\r\n      Dim Chaos, or the sea of troubles, is struggling through all its\r\n      elements; writhing and chafing towards some creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.3.IX.\r\n      Extinct.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, on Friday, the Thirty-first of May 1793, there comes\r\n      forth into the summer sunlight one of the strangest scenes. Mayor\r\n      Pache with Municipality arrives at the Tuileries Hall of\r\n      Convention; sent for, Paris being in visible ferment; and gives\r\n      the strangest news.\r\n\r\n      How, in the grey of this morning, while we sat Permanent in\r\n      Townhall, watchful for the commonweal, there entered, precisely\r\n      as on a Tenth of August, some Ninety-six extraneous persons; who\r\n      declared themselves to be in a state of Insurrection; to be\r\n      plenipotentiary Commissioners from the Forty-eight Sections,\r\n      sections or members of the Sovereign People, all in a state of\r\n      Insurrection; and further that we, in the name of said Sovereign\r\n      in Insurrection, were dismissed from office. How we thereupon\r\n      laid off our sashes, and withdrew into the adjacent Saloon of\r\n      Liberty. How in a moment or two, we were called back; and\r\n      reinstated; the Sovereign pleasing to think us still worthy of\r\n      confidence. Whereby, having taken new oath of office, we on a\r\n      sudden find ourselves Insurrectionary Magistrates, with\r\n      extraneous Committee of Ninety-six sitting by us; and a Citoyen\r\n      Henriot, one whom some accuse of Septemberism, is made\r\n      Generalissimo of the National Guard; and, since six o’clock, the\r\n      tocsins ring and the drums beat:—Under which peculiar\r\n      circumstances, what would an august National Convention please to\r\n      direct us to do?[651]\r\n\r\n      Yes, there is the question! ‘Break the Insurrectionary\r\n      Authorities,’ answers some with vehemence. Vergniaud at least\r\n      will have ‘the National Representatives all die at their post;’\r\n      this is sworn to, with ready loud acclaim. But as to breaking the\r\n      Insurrectionary Authorities,—alas, while we yet debate, what\r\n      sound is that? Sound of the Alarm-Cannon on the Pont Neuf; which\r\n      it is death by the Law to fire without order from us!\r\n\r\n      It does boom off there, nevertheless; sending a sound through all\r\n      hearts. And the tocsins discourse stern music; and Henriot with\r\n      his Armed Force has enveloped us! And Section succeeds Section,\r\n      the livelong day; demanding with Cambyses’-oratory, with the\r\n      rattle of muskets, That traitors, Twenty-two or more, be\r\n      punished; that the Commission of Twelve be irrecoverably broken.\r\n      The heart of the Gironde dies within it; distant are the\r\n      Seventy-two respectable Departments, this fiery Municipality is\r\n      near! Barrère is for a middle course; granting something. The\r\n      Commission of Twelve declares that, not waiting to be broken, it\r\n      hereby breaks itself, and is no more. Fain would Reporter Rabaut\r\n      speak his and its last-words; but he is bellowed off. Too happy\r\n      that the Twenty-two are still left unviolated!—Vergniaud,\r\n      carrying the laws of refinement to a great length, moves, to the\r\n      amazement of some, that “the Sections of Paris have deserved well\r\n      of their country.” Whereupon, at a late hour of the evening, the\r\n      deserving Sections retire to their respective places of abode.\r\n      Barrère shall report on it. With busy quill and brain he sits,\r\n      secluded; for him no sleep tonight. Friday the last of May has\r\n      ended in this manner.\r\n\r\n      The Sections have deserved well: but ought they not to deserve\r\n      better? Faction and Girondism is struck down for the moment, and\r\n      consents to be a nullity; but will it not, at another favourabler\r\n      moment rise, still feller; and the Republic have to be saved in\r\n      spite of it? So reasons Patriotism, still Permanent; so reasons\r\n      the Figure of Marat, visible in the dim Section-world, on the\r\n      morrow. To the conviction of men!—And so at eventide of Saturday,\r\n      when Barrère had just got it all varnished in the course of the\r\n      day, and his Report was setting off in the evening mail-bags,\r\n      tocsin peals out _again! Générale_ is beating; armed men taking\r\n      station in the Place Vendôme and elsewhere for the night;\r\n      supplied with provisions and liquor. There under the summer stars\r\n      will they wait, this night, what is to be seen and to be done,\r\n      Henriot and Townhall giving due signal.\r\n\r\n      The Convention, at sound of _générale_, hastens back to its Hall;\r\n      but to the number only of a Hundred; and does little business,\r\n      puts off business till the morrow. The Girondins do not stir out\r\n      thither, the Girondins are abroad seeking beds. Poor Rabaut, on\r\n      the morrow morning, returning to his post, with Louvet and some\r\n      others, through streets all in ferment, wrings his hands,\r\n      ejaculating, ‘_Illa suprema dies!_’[652] It has become Sunday,\r\n      the second day of June, year 1793, by the old style; by the new\r\n      style, year One of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. We have got to\r\n      the last scene of all, that ends this history of the Girondin\r\n      Senatorship.\r\n\r\n      It seems doubtful whether any terrestrial Convention had ever met\r\n      in such circumstances as this National one now does. Tocsin is\r\n      pealing; Barriers shut; all Paris is on the gaze, or under arms.\r\n      As many as a Hundred Thousand under arms they count: National\r\n      Force; and the Armed Volunteers, who should have flown to the\r\n      Frontiers and La Vendée; but would not, treason being unpunished;\r\n      and only flew hither and thither! So many, steady under arms,\r\n      environ the National Tuileries and Garden. There are horse, foot,\r\n      artillery, sappers with beards: the artillery one can see with\r\n      their camp-furnaces in this National Garden, heating bullets red,\r\n      and their match is lighted. Henriot in plumes rides, amid a\r\n      plumed Staff: all posts and issues are safe; reserves lie out, as\r\n      far as the Wood of Boulogne; the choicest Patriots nearest the\r\n      scene. One other circumstance we will note: that a careful\r\n      Municipality, liberal of camp-furnaces, has not forgotten\r\n      provision-carts. No member of the Sovereign need now go home to\r\n      dinner; but can keep rank,—plentiful victual circulating\r\n      unsought. Does not this People understand Insurrection? Ye, _not_\r\n      uninventive, _Gualches!_—\r\n\r\n      Therefore let a National Representation, “mandatories of the\r\n      Sovereign,” take thought of it. Expulsion of your Twenty-two, and\r\n      your Commission of Twelve: we stand here till it be done!\r\n      Deputation after Deputation, in ever stronger language, comes\r\n      with that message. Barrère proposes a middle course:—Will not\r\n      perhaps the inculpated Deputies consent to withdraw voluntarily;\r\n      to make a generous demission, and self-sacrifice for the sake of\r\n      one’s country? Isnard, repentant of that search on which\r\n      river-bank Paris stood, declares himself ready to demit. Ready\r\n      also is _Te-Deum_ Fauchet; old Dusaulx of the Bastille, “_vieux\r\n      radoteur_, old dotard,” as Marat calls him, is still readier. On\r\n      the contrary, Lanjuinais the Breton declares that there is one\r\n      man who never will demit voluntarily; but will protest to the\r\n      uttermost, while a voice is left him. And he accordingly goes on\r\n      protesting; amid rage and clangor; Legendre crying at last:\r\n      ‘Lanjuinais, come down from the Tribune, or I will fling thee\r\n      down, _ou je te jette en bas!_’ For matters are come to\r\n      extremity. Nay they do clutch hold of Lanjuinais, certain zealous\r\n      Mountain-men; but cannot fling him down, for he “cramps himself\r\n      on the railing;” and “his clothes get torn.” Brave Senator,\r\n      worthy of pity! Neither will Barbaroux demit; he ‘has sworn to\r\n      die at his post, and will keep that oath.’ Whereupon the\r\n      Galleries all rise with explosion; brandishing weapons, some of\r\n      them; and rush out saying: ‘_Allons_, then; we must save our\r\n      country!’ Such a Session is this of Sunday the second of June.\r\n\r\n      Churches fill, over Christian Europe, and then empty themselves;\r\n      but this Convention empties not, the while: a day of shrieking\r\n      contention, of agony, humiliation and tearing of coatskirts;\r\n      _illa suprema dies!_ Round stand Henriot and his Hundred\r\n      Thousand, copiously refreshed from tray and basket: nay he is\r\n      “distributing five francs a-piece;” we Girondins saw it with our\r\n      eyes; five francs to keep them in heart! And distraction of armed\r\n      riot encumbers our borders, jangles at our Bar; we are prisoners\r\n      in our own Hall: Bishop Grégoire could not get out for a _besoin\r\n      actuel_ without four gendarmes to wait on him! What is the\r\n      character of a National Representative become? And now the\r\n      sunlight falls yellower on western windows, and the chimney-tops\r\n      are flinging longer shadows; the refreshed Hundred Thousand, nor\r\n      their shadows, stir not! What to resolve on? Motion rises,\r\n      superfluous one would think, That the Convention go forth in a\r\n      body; ascertain with its own eyes whether it is free or not. Lo,\r\n      therefore, from the Eastern Gate of the Tuileries, a distressed\r\n      Convention issuing; handsome Hérault Séchelles at their head; he\r\n      with hat on, in sign of public calamity, the rest\r\n      bareheaded,—towards the Gate of the Carrousel; wondrous to see:\r\n      towards Henriot and his plumed staff. ‘In the name of the\r\n      National Convention, make way!’ Not an inch of the way does\r\n      Henriot make: ‘I receive no orders, till the Sovereign, yours and\r\n      mine, has been obeyed.’ The Convention presses on; Henriot\r\n      prances back, with his staff, some fifteen paces, ‘To arms!\r\n      Cannoneers to your guns!’—flashes out his puissant sword, as the\r\n      Staff all do, and the Hussars all do. Cannoneers brandish the lit\r\n      match; Infantry present arms,—alas, in the level way, as if for\r\n      firing! Hatted Herault leads his distressed flock, through their\r\n      pinfold of a Tuileries again; across the Garden, to the Gate on\r\n      the opposite side. Here is Feuillans Terrace, alas, there is our\r\n      old Salle de Manége; but neither at this Gate of the Pont\r\n      Tournant is there egress. Try the other; and the other: no\r\n      egress! We wander disconsolate through armed ranks; who indeed\r\n      salute with _Live the Republic_, but also with _Die the Gironde_.\r\n      Other such sight, in the year One of Liberty, the westering sun\r\n      never saw.\r\n\r\n      And now behold Marat meets us; for he lagged in this Suppliant\r\n      Procession of ours: he has got some hundred elect Patriots at his\r\n      heels: he orders us in the Sovereign’s name to return to our\r\n      place, and do as we are bidden and bound. The Convention returns.\r\n      ‘Does not the Convention,’ says Couthon with a singular power of\r\n      face, ‘see that it is free?’—none but friends round it? The\r\n      Convention, overflowing with friends and armed Sectioners,\r\n      proceeds to vote as bidden. Many will not vote, but remain\r\n      silent; some one or two protest, in words: the Mountain has a\r\n      clear unanimity. Commission of Twelve, and the denounced\r\n      Twenty-two, to whom we add Ex-Ministers Clavière and Lebrun:\r\n      these, with some slight extempore alterations (this or that\r\n      orator proposing, but Marat disposing), are voted to be under\r\n      “Arrestment in their own houses.” Brissot, Buzot, Vergniaud,\r\n      Guadet, Louvet, Gensonné, Barbaroux, Lasource, Lanjuinais,\r\n      Rabaut,—Thirty-two, by the tale; all that we have known as\r\n      Girondins, and more than we have known. They, “under the\r\n      safeguard of the French People;” by and by, under the safeguard\r\n      of two Gendarmes each, shall dwell peaceably in their own houses;\r\n      as Non-Senators; till further order. Herewith ends _Séance_ of\r\n      Sunday the second of June 1793.\r\n\r\n      At ten o’clock, under mild stars, the Hundred Thousand, their\r\n      work well finished, turn homewards. This same day, Central\r\n      Insurrection Committee has arrested Madame Roland; imprisoned her\r\n      in the Abbaye. Roland has fled, no one knows whither.\r\n\r\n      Thus fell the Girondins, by Insurrection; and became extinct as a\r\n      Party: not without a sigh from most Historians. The men were men\r\n      of parts, of Philosophic culture, decent behaviour; not\r\n      condemnable in that they were Pedants and had not better parts;\r\n      not condemnable, but most unfortunate. They wanted a Republic of\r\n      the Virtues, wherein themselves should be head; and they could\r\n      only get a Republic of the Strengths, wherein others than they\r\n      were head.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, Barrère shall make Report of it. The night\r\n      concludes with a “civic promenade by torchlight:”[653] surely the\r\n      true reign of Fraternity is now not far?\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 3.IV.\r\n      TERROR\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.I.\r\n      Charlotte Corday.\r\n\r\n      In the leafy months of June and July, several French Departments\r\n      germinate a set of rebellious _paper_-leaves, named\r\n      Proclamations, Resolutions, Journals, or Diurnals “of the Union\r\n      for Resistance to Oppression.” In particular, the Town of Caen,\r\n      in Calvados, sees its paper-leaf of _Bulletin de Caen_ suddenly\r\n      bud, suddenly establish itself as Newspaper there; under the\r\n      Editorship of Girondin National Representatives!\r\n\r\n      For among the proscribed Girondins are certain of a more\r\n      desperate humour. Some, as Vergniaud, Valazé, Gensonné, “arrested\r\n      in their own houses” will await with stoical resignation what the\r\n      issue may be. Some, as Brissot, Rabaut, will take to flight, to\r\n      concealment; which, as the Paris Barriers are opened again in a\r\n      day or two, is not yet difficult. But others there are who will\r\n      rush, with Buzot, to Calvados; or far over France, to Lyons,\r\n      Toulon, Nantes and elsewhither, and then rendezvous at Caen: to\r\n      awaken as with war-trumpet the respectable Departments; and\r\n      strike down an anarchic Mountain Faction; at least not yield\r\n      without a stroke at it. Of this latter temper we count some score\r\n      or more, of the Arrested, and of the Not-yet-arrested; a Buzot, a\r\n      Barbaroux, Louvet, Guadet, Pétion, who have escaped from\r\n      Arrestment in their own homes; a Salles, a Pythagorean Valady, a\r\n      Duchâtel, the Duchâtel that came in blanket and nightcap to vote\r\n      for the life of Louis, who have escaped from danger and\r\n      likelihood of Arrestment. These, to the number at one time of\r\n      Twenty-seven, do accordingly lodge here, at the “_Intendance_, or\r\n      Departmental Mansion,” of the Town of Caen; welcomed by Persons\r\n      in Authority; welcomed and defrayed, having no money of their\r\n      own. And the _Bulletin de Caen_ comes forth, with the most\r\n      animating paragraphs: How the Bourdeaux Department, the Lyons\r\n      Department, this Department after the other is declaring itself;\r\n      sixty, or say sixty-nine, or seventy-two[654] respectable\r\n      Departments either declaring, or ready to declare. Nay\r\n      Marseilles, it seems, will march on Paris by itself, if need be.\r\n      So has Marseilles Town said, That she will march. But on the\r\n      other hand, that Montélimart Town has said, No thoroughfare; and\r\n      means even to “bury herself” under her own stone and mortar\r\n      first—of this be no mention in _Bulletin of Caen_.\r\n\r\n      Such animating paragraphs we read in this Newspaper; and\r\n      fervours, and eloquent sarcasm: tirades against the Mountain,\r\n      frame pen of Deputy Salles; which resemble, say friends, Pascal’s\r\n      _Provincials_. What is more to the purpose, these Girondins have\r\n      got a General in chief, one Wimpfen, formerly under Dumouriez;\r\n      also a secondary questionable General Puisaye, and others; and\r\n      are doing their best to raise a force for war. National\r\n      Volunteers, whosoever is of right heart: gather in, ye National\r\n      Volunteers, friends of Liberty; from our Calvados Townships, from\r\n      the Eure, from Brittany, from far and near; forward to Paris, and\r\n      extinguish Anarchy! Thus at Caen, in the early July days, there\r\n      is a drumming and parading, a perorating and consulting: Staff\r\n      and Army; Council; Club of _Carabots_, Anti-jacobin friends of\r\n      Freedom, to denounce atrocious Marat. With all which, and the\r\n      editing of _Bulletins_, a National Representative has his hands\r\n      full.\r\n\r\n      At Caen it is most animated; and, as one hopes, more or less\r\n      animated in the “Seventy-two Departments that adhere to us.” And\r\n      in a France begirt with Cimmerian invading Coalitions, and torn\r\n      with an internal La Vendée, _this_ is the conclusion we have\r\n      arrived at: to put down Anarchy by Civil War! _Durum et durum_,\r\n      the Proverb says, _non faciunt murum_. La Vendée burns: Santerre\r\n      can do nothing there; he may return home and brew beer. Cimmerian\r\n      bombshells fly all along the North. That Siege of Mentz is become\r\n      famed;—lovers of the Picturesque (as Goethe will testify), washed\r\n      country-people of both sexes, stroll thither on Sundays, to see\r\n      the artillery work and counterwork; “you only duck a little while\r\n      the shot whizzes past.”[655] Condé is capitulating to the\r\n      Austrians; Royal Highness of York, these several weeks, fiercely\r\n      batters Valenciennes. For, alas, our fortified Camp of Famars was\r\n      stormed; General Dampierre was killed; General Custine was\r\n      blamed,—and indeed is now come to Paris to give “explanations.”\r\n\r\n      Against all which the Mountain and atrocious Marat must even make\r\n      head as they can. They, anarchic Convention as they are, publish\r\n      Decrees, expostulatory, explanatory, yet not without severity;\r\n      they ray forth Commissioners, singly or in pairs, the\r\n      olive-branch in one hand, yet the sword in the other.\r\n      Commissioners come even to Caen; but without effect. Mathematical\r\n      Romme, and Prieur named of the Côte d’Or, venturing thither, with\r\n      their olive and sword, are packed into prison: there may Romme\r\n      lie, under lock and key, “for fifty days;” and meditate his New\r\n      Calendar, if he please. Cimmeria and Civil War! Never was\r\n      Republic One and Indivisible at a lower ebb.—\r\n\r\n      Amid which dim ferment of Caen and the World, History specially\r\n      notices one thing: in the lobby of the Mansion _de l’Intendance_,\r\n      where busy Deputies are coming and going, a young Lady with an\r\n      aged valet, taking grave graceful leave of Deputy Barbaroux.[656]\r\n      She is of stately Norman figure; in her twenty-fifth year; of\r\n      beautiful still countenance: her name is Charlotte Corday,\r\n      heretofore styled d’Armans, while Nobility still was. Barbaroux\r\n      has given her a Note to Deputy Duperret,—him who once drew his\r\n      sword in the effervescence. Apparently she will to Paris on some\r\n      errand? “She was a Republican before the Revolution, and never\r\n      wanted energy.” A completeness, a decision is in this fair female\r\n      Figure: “by energy she means the spirit that will prompt one to\r\n      sacrifice himself for his country.” What if she, this fair young\r\n      Charlotte, had emerged from her secluded stillness, suddenly like\r\n      a Star; cruel-lovely, with half-angelic, half-demonic splendour;\r\n      to gleam for a moment, and in a moment be extinguished: to be\r\n      held in memory, so bright complete was she, through long\r\n      centuries!—Quitting Cimmerian Coalitions without, and the\r\n      dim-simmering Twenty-five millions within, History will look\r\n      fixedly at this one fair Apparition of a Charlotte Corday; will\r\n      note whither Charlotte moves, how the little Life burns forth so\r\n      radiant, then vanishes swallowed of the Night.\r\n\r\n      With Barbaroux’s Note of Introduction, and slight stock of\r\n      luggage, we see Charlotte, on Tuesday the ninth of July, seated\r\n      in the Caen Diligence, with a place for Paris. None takes\r\n      farewell of her, wishes her Good-journey: her Father will find a\r\n      line left, signifying that she is gone to England, that he must\r\n      pardon her and forget her. The drowsy Diligence lumbers along;\r\n      amid drowsy talk of Politics, and praise of the Mountain; in\r\n      which she mingles not; all night, all day, and again all night.\r\n      On Thursday, not long before none, we are at the Bridge of\r\n      Neuilly; here is Paris with her thousand black domes,—the goal\r\n      and purpose of thy journey! Arrived at the Inn de la Providence\r\n      in the Rue des Vieux Augustins, Charlotte demands a room; hastens\r\n      to bed; sleeps all afternoon and night, till the morrow morning.\r\n\r\n      On the morrow morning, she delivers her Note to Duperret. It\r\n      relates to certain Family Papers which are in the Minister of the\r\n      Interior’s hand; which a Nun at Caen, an old Convent-friend of\r\n      Charlotte’s, has need of; which Duperret shall assist her in\r\n      getting: this then was Charlotte’s errand to Paris? She has\r\n      finished this, in the course of Friday;—yet says nothing of\r\n      returning. She has seen and silently investigated several things.\r\n      The Convention, in bodily reality, she has seen; what the\r\n      Mountain is like. The living physiognomy of Marat she could not\r\n      see; he is sick at present, and confined to home.\r\n\r\n      About eight on the Saturday morning, she purchases a large\r\n      sheath-knife in the Palais Royal; then straightway, in the Place\r\n      des Victoires, takes a hackney-coach: ‘To the Rue de l’Ecole de\r\n      Médecine, No. 44.’ It is the residence of the Citoyen Marat!—The\r\n      Citoyen Marat is ill, and cannot be seen; which seems to\r\n      disappoint her much. Her business is with Marat, then? Hapless\r\n      beautiful Charlotte; hapless squalid Marat! From Caen in the\r\n      utmost West, from Neuchâtel in the utmost East, they two are\r\n      drawing nigh each other; they two have, very strangely, business\r\n      together.—Charlotte, returning to her Inn, despatches a short\r\n      Note to Marat; signifying that she is from Caen, the seat of\r\n      rebellion; that she desires earnestly to see him, and “will put\r\n      it in his power to do France a great service.” No answer.\r\n      Charlotte writes another Note, still more pressing; sets out with\r\n      it by coach, about seven in the evening, herself. Tired\r\n      day-labourers have again finished their Week; huge Paris is\r\n      circling and simmering, manifold, according to its vague wont:\r\n      this one fair Figure has decision in it; drives straight,—towards\r\n      a purpose.\r\n\r\n      It is yellow July evening, we say, the thirteenth of the month;\r\n      eve of the Bastille day,—when “M. Marat,” four years ago, in the\r\n      crowd of the Pont Neuf, shrewdly required of that Besenval\r\n      Hussar-party, which had such friendly dispositions, ‘to dismount,\r\n      and give up their arms, then;’ and became notable among Patriot\r\n      men! Four years: what a road he has travelled;—and sits now,\r\n      about half-past seven of the clock, stewing in slipper-bath; sore\r\n      afflicted; ill of Revolution Fever,—of what other malady this\r\n      History had rather not name. Excessively sick and worn, poor man:\r\n      with precisely elevenpence-halfpenny of ready money, in paper;\r\n      with slipper-bath; strong three-footed stool for writing on, the\r\n      while; and a squalid—Washerwoman, one may call her: that is his\r\n      civic establishment in Medical-School Street; thither and not\r\n      elsewhither has his road led him. Not to the reign of Brotherhood\r\n      and Perfect Felicity; yet surely on the way towards that?—Hark, a\r\n      rap again! A musical woman’s-voice, refusing to be rejected: it\r\n      is the Citoyenne who would do France a service. Marat,\r\n      recognising from within, cries, Admit her. Charlotte Corday is\r\n      admitted.\r\n\r\n      Citoyen Marat, I am from Caen the seat of rebellion, and wished\r\n      to speak with you.—Be seated, _mon enfant_. Now what are the\r\n      Traitors doing at Caen? What Deputies are at Caen?—Charlotte\r\n      names some Deputies. ‘Their heads shall fall within a fortnight,’\r\n      croaks the eager People’s-Friend, clutching his tablets to write:\r\n      _Barbaroux, Pétion_, writes he with bare shrunk arm, turning\r\n      aside in the bath: _Pétion_, and _Louvet_, and—Charlotte has\r\n      drawn her knife from the sheath; plunges it, with one sure\r\n      stroke, into the writer’s heart. ‘_À moi, chère amie_, Help,\r\n      dear!’ No more could the Death-choked say or shriek. The helpful\r\n      Washerwoman running in, there is no Friend of the People, or\r\n      Friend of the Washerwoman, left; but his life with a groan gushes\r\n      out, indignant, to the shades below.[657]\r\n\r\n      And so Marat People’s-Friend is ended; the lone Stylites has got\r\n      hurled down suddenly from his Pillar,—_whitherward_ He that made\r\n      him does know. Patriot Paris may sound triple and tenfold, in\r\n      dole and wail; re-echoed by Patriot France; and the Convention,\r\n      “Chabot pale with terror declaring that they are to be all\r\n      assassinated,” may decree him Pantheon Honours, Public Funeral,\r\n      Mirabeau’s dust making way for him; and Jacobin Societies, in\r\n      lamentable oratory, summing up his character, parallel him to\r\n      One, whom they think it honour to call “the good\r\n      Sansculotte,”—whom we name not here.[658] Also a Chapel may be\r\n      made, for the urn that holds his Heart, in the Place du\r\n      Carrousel; and new-born children be named Marat; and Lago-de-Como\r\n      Hawkers bake mountains of stucco into unbeautiful Busts; and\r\n      David paint his Picture, or Death-scene; and such other\r\n      Apotheosis take place as the human genius, in these\r\n      circumstances, can devise: but Marat returns no more to the light\r\n      of this Sun. One sole circumstance we have read with clear\r\n      sympathy, in the old _Moniteur_ Newspaper: how Marat’s brother\r\n      comes from Neuchâtel to ask of the Convention “that the deceased\r\n      Jean-Paul Marat’s musket be given him.”[659] For Marat too had a\r\n      brother, and natural affections; and was wrapt once in\r\n      swaddling-clothes, and slept safe in a cradle like the rest of\r\n      us. Ye children of men!—A sister of his, they say, lives still to\r\n      this day in Paris.\r\n\r\n      As for Charlotte Corday her work is accomplished; the recompense\r\n      of it is near and sure. The _chère amie_, and neighbours of the\r\n      house, flying at her, she “overturns some movables,” entrenches\r\n      herself till the gendarmes arrive; then quietly surrenders; goes\r\n      quietly to the Abbaye Prison: she alone quiet, all Paris sounding\r\n      in wonder, in rage or admiration, round her. Duperret is put in\r\n      arrest, on account of her; his Papers sealed,—which may lead to\r\n      consequences. Fauchet, in like manner; though Fauchet had not so\r\n      much as heard of her. Charlotte, confronted with these two\r\n      Deputies, praises the grave firmness of Duperret, censures the\r\n      dejection of Fauchet.\r\n\r\n      On Wednesday morning, the thronged Palais de Justice and\r\n      Revolutionary Tribunal can see her face; beautiful and calm: she\r\n      dates it “fourth day of the Preparation of Peace.” A strange\r\n      murmur ran through the Hall, at sight of her; you could not say\r\n      of what character.[660] Tinville has his indictments and\r\n      tape-papers the cutler of the Palais Royal will testify that he\r\n      sold her the sheath-knife; ‘all these details are needless,’\r\n      interrupted Charlotte; ‘it is I that killed Marat.’ By whose\r\n      instigation?—‘By no one’s.’ What tempted you, then? His crimes.\r\n      ‘I killed one man,’ added she, raising her voice extremely\r\n      (_extrêmement_), as they went on with their questions, ‘I killed\r\n      one man to save a hundred thousand; a villain to save innocents;\r\n      a savage wild-beast to give repose to my country. I was a\r\n      Republican before the Revolution; I never wanted energy.’ There\r\n      is therefore nothing to be said. The public gazes astonished: the\r\n      hasty limners sketch her features, Charlotte not disapproving;\r\n      the men of law proceed with their formalities. The doom is Death\r\n      as a murderess. To her Advocate she gives thanks; in gentle\r\n      phrase, in high-flown classical spirit. To the Priest they send\r\n      her she gives thanks; but needs not any shriving, or ghostly or\r\n      other aid from him.\r\n\r\n      On this same evening, therefore, about half-past seven o’clock,\r\n      from the gate of the Conciergerie, to a City all on tiptoe, the\r\n      fatal Cart issues: seated on it a fair young creature, sheeted in\r\n      red smock of Murderess; so beautiful, serene, so full of life;\r\n      journeying towards death,—alone amid the world. Many take off\r\n      their hats, saluting reverently; for what heart but must be\r\n      touched?[661] Others growl and howl. Adam Lux, of Mentz, declares\r\n      that she is greater than Brutus; that it were beautiful to die\r\n      with her: the head of this young man seems turned. At the Place\r\n      de la Révolution, the countenance of Charlotte wears the same\r\n      still smile. The executioners proceed to bind her feet; she\r\n      resists, thinking it meant as an insult; on a word of\r\n      explanation, she submits with cheerful apology. As the last act,\r\n      all being now ready, they take the neckerchief from her neck: a\r\n      blush of maidenly shame overspreads that fair face and neck; the\r\n      cheeks were still tinged with it, when the executioner lifted the\r\n      severed head, to shew it to the people. “It is most true,” says\r\n      Foster, “that he struck the cheek insultingly; for I saw it with\r\n      my eyes: the Police imprisoned him for it.”[662]\r\n\r\n      In this manner have the Beautifullest and the Squalidest come in\r\n      collision, and extinguished one another. Jean-Paul Marat and\r\n      Marie-Anne Charlotte Corday both, suddenly, are no more. “Day of\r\n      the Preparation of Peace?” Alas, how were peace possible or\r\n      preparable, while, for example, the hearts of lovely Maidens, in\r\n      their convent-stillness, are dreaming not of Love-paradises, and\r\n      the light of Life; but of Codrus’-sacrifices, and death well\r\n      earned? That Twenty-five million hearts have got to such temper,\r\n      this _is_ the Anarchy; the soul of it lies in this: whereof not\r\n      peace can be the embodyment! The death of Marat, whetting old\r\n      animosities tenfold, will be worse than any life. O ye hapless\r\n      Two, mutually extinctive, the Beautiful and the Squalid, sleep ye\r\n      well,—in the Mother’s bosom that bore you both!\r\n\r\n      This was the History of Charlotte Corday; most definite, most\r\n      complete; angelic-demonic: like a Star! Adam Lux goes home,\r\n      half-delirious; to pour forth his Apotheosis of her, in paper and\r\n      print; to propose that she have a statue with this inscription,\r\n      _Greater than Brutus_. Friends represent his danger; Lux is\r\n      reckless; thinks it were beautiful to die with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.II.\r\n      In Civil War.\r\n\r\n      But during these same hours, another guillotine is at work, on\r\n      another: Charlotte, for the Girondins, dies at Paris today;\r\n      Chalier, by the Girondins, dies at Lyons tomorrow.\r\n\r\n      From rumbling of cannon along the streets of that City, it has\r\n      come to firing of them, to rabid fighting: Nièvre-Chol and the\r\n      Girondins triumph;—behind whom there is, as everywhere, a\r\n      Royalist Faction waiting to strike in. Trouble enough at Lyons;\r\n      and the dominant party carrying it with a high hand! For indeed,\r\n      the whole South is astir; incarcerating Jacobins; arming for\r\n      Girondins: wherefore we have got a “Congress of Lyons;” also a\r\n      “Revolutionary Tribunal of Lyons,” and Anarchists shall tremble.\r\n      So Chalier was soon found guilty, of Jacobinism, of murderous\r\n      Plot, “address with drawn dagger on the sixth of February last;”\r\n      and, on the morrow, he also travels his final road, along the\r\n      streets of Lyons, “by the side of an ecclesiastic, with whom he\r\n      seems to speak earnestly,”—the axe now glittering high. He could\r\n      weep, in old years, this man, and “fall on his knees on the\r\n      pavement,” blessing Heaven at sight of Federation Programs or\r\n      like; then he pilgrimed to Paris, to worship Marat and the\r\n      Mountain: now Marat and he are both gone;—we said he could not\r\n      end well. Jacobinism groans inwardly, at Lyons; but dare not\r\n      outwardly. Chalier, when the Tribunal sentenced him, made answer:\r\n      ‘My death will cost this City dear.’\r\n\r\n      Montélimart Town is not buried under its ruins; yet Marseilles is\r\n      actually marching, under order of a “Lyons Congress;” is\r\n      incarcerating Patriots; the very Royalists now shewing face.\r\n      Against which a General Cartaux fights, though in small force;\r\n      and with him an Artillery Major, of the name of—Napoleon\r\n      Buonaparte. This Napoleon, to prove that the Marseillese have no\r\n      chance ultimately, not only fights but writes; publishes his\r\n      _Supper of Beaucaire_, a Dialogue which has become curious.[663]\r\n      Unfortunate Cities, with their actions and their reactions!\r\n      Violence to be paid with violence in geometrical ratio; Royalism\r\n      and Anarchism both striking in;—the final net-amount of which\r\n      geometrical series, what man shall sum?\r\n\r\n      The Bar of Iron has never yet floated in Marseilles Harbour; but\r\n      the Body of Rebecqui was found floating, self-drowned there. Hot\r\n      Rebecqui seeing how confusion deepened, and Respectability grew\r\n      poisoned with Royalism, felt that there was no refuge for a\r\n      Republican but death. Rebecqui disappeared: no one knew whither;\r\n      till, one morning, they found the empty case or body of him risen\r\n      to the top, tumbling on the salt waves;[664] and perceived that\r\n      Rebecqui had withdrawn forever.—Toulon likewise is incarcerating\r\n      Patriots; sending delegates to Congress; intriguing, in case of\r\n      necessity, with the Royalists and English. Montpellier,\r\n      Bourdeaux, Nantes: all France, that is not under the swoop of\r\n      Austria and Cimmeria, seems rushing into madness, and suicidal\r\n      ruin. The Mountain labours; like a volcano in a burning volcanic\r\n      Land. Convention Committees, of Surety, of Salvation, are busy\r\n      night and day: Convention Commissioners whirl on all highways;\r\n      bearing olive-branch and sword, or now perhaps sword only.\r\n      Chaumette and Municipals come daily to the Tuileries demanding a\r\n      Constitution: it is some weeks now since he resolved, in\r\n      Townhall, that a Deputation “should go every day” and demand a\r\n      Constitution, till one were got;[665] whereby suicidal France\r\n      might rally and pacify itself; a thing inexpressibly desirable.\r\n\r\n      This then is the fruit your Anti-anarchic Girondins have got from\r\n      that Levying of War in Calvados? This fruit, we may say; and no\r\n      other whatsoever. For indeed, before either Charlotte’s or\r\n      Chalier’s head had fallen, the Calvados War itself had, as it\r\n      were, vanished, dreamlike, in a shriek! With “seventy-two\r\n      Departments” on one’s side, one might have hoped better things.\r\n      But it turns out that Respectabilities, though they will vote,\r\n      will not fight. Possession is always nine points in Law; but in\r\n      Lawsuits of _this_ kind, one may say, it is ninety-and-nine\r\n      points. Men do what they were wont to do; and have immense\r\n      irresolution and inertia: they obey him who has the symbols that\r\n      claim obedience. Consider what, in modern society, this one fact\r\n      means: the Metropolis is with our enemies! Metropolis,\r\n      _Mother-city;_ rightly so named: all the rest are but as her\r\n      children, her nurselings. Why, there is not a leathern Diligence,\r\n      with its post-bags and luggage-boots, that lumbers out from her,\r\n      but is as a huge life-pulse; she is the heart of all. Cut short\r\n      that one leathern Diligence, how much is cut short!—General\r\n      Wimpfen, looking practically into the matter, can see nothing for\r\n      it but that one should fall back on Royalism; get into\r\n      communication with Pitt! Dark innuendoes he flings out, to that\r\n      effect: whereat we Girondins start, horrorstruck. He produces as\r\n      his Second in command a certain “_Ci-devant_,” one Comte Puisaye;\r\n      entirely unknown to Louvet; greatly suspected by him.\r\n\r\n      Few wars, accordingly, were ever levied of a more insufficient\r\n      character than this of Calvados. He that is curious in such\r\n      things may read the details of it in the Memoirs of that same\r\n      _Ci-devant_ Puisaye, the much-enduring man and Royalist: How our\r\n      Girondin National Forces, marching off with plenty of wind-music,\r\n      were drawn out about the old Château of Brecourt, in the\r\n      wood-country near Vernon, to meet the Mountain National forces\r\n      advancing from Paris. How on the fifteenth afternoon of July,\r\n      they did meet,—and, as it were, shrieked mutually, and took\r\n      mutually to flight without loss. How Puisaye thereafter, for the\r\n      Mountain Nationals fled first, and we thought ourselves the\r\n      victors,—was roused from his warm bed in the Castle of Brecourt;\r\n      and had to gallop without boots; our Nationals, in the\r\n      night-watches, having fallen unexpectedly into _sauve qui\r\n      peut:_—and in brief the Calvados War had burnt priming; and the\r\n      only question now was, Whitherward to vanish, in what hole to\r\n      hide oneself![666]\r\n\r\n      The National Volunteers rush homewards, faster than they came.\r\n      The Seventy-two Respectable Departments, says Meillan, “all\r\n      turned round, and forsook us, in the space of four-and-twenty\r\n      hours.” Unhappy those who, as at Lyons for instance, have gone\r\n      too far for turning! “One morning,” we find placarded on our\r\n      Intendance Mansion, the Decree of Convention which casts us _Hors\r\n      la loi_, into Outlawry: placarded by our Caen Magistrates;—clear\r\n      hint that we also are to vanish. Vanish, indeed: but whitherward?\r\n      Gorsas has friends in Rennes; he will hide there,—unhappily will\r\n      not lie hid. Guadet, Lanjuinais are on cross roads; making for\r\n      Bourdeaux. To Bourdeaux! cries the general voice, of Valour alike\r\n      and of Despair. Some flag of Respectability still floats there,\r\n      or is thought to float.\r\n\r\n      Thitherward therefore; each as he can! Eleven of these ill-fated\r\n      Deputies, among whom we may count, as twelfth, Friend Riouffe the\r\n      Man of Letters, do an original thing. Take the uniform of\r\n      National Volunteers, and retreat southward with the Breton\r\n      Battalion, as private soldiers of that corps. These brave Bretons\r\n      had stood truer by us than any other. Nevertheless, at the end of\r\n      a day or two, they also do now get dubious, self-divided; we must\r\n      part from them; and, with some half-dozen as convoy or guide,\r\n      retreat by ourselves,—a solitary marching detachment, through\r\n      waste regions of the West.[667]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.III.\r\n      Retreat of the Eleven.\r\n\r\n      It is one of the notablest Retreats, this of the Eleven, that\r\n      History presents: The handful of forlorn Legislators retreating\r\n      there, continually, with shouldered firelock and well-filled\r\n      cartridge-box, in the yellow autumn; long hundreds of miles\r\n      between them and Bourdeaux; the country all getting hostile,\r\n      suspicious of the truth; simmering and buzzing on all sides, more\r\n      and more. Louvet has preserved the Itinerary of it; a piece worth\r\n      all the rest he ever wrote.\r\n\r\n      O virtuous Pétion, with thy early-white head, O brave young\r\n      Barbaroux, has it come to this? Weary ways, worn shoes, light\r\n      purse;—encompassed with perils as with a sea! Revolutionary\r\n      Committees are in every Township; of Jacobin temper; our friends\r\n      all cowed, our cause the losing one. In the Borough of\r\n      Moncontour, by ill chance, it is market-day: to the gaping public\r\n      such transit of a solitary Marching Detachment is suspicious; we\r\n      have need of energy, of promptitude and luck, to be allowed to\r\n      march through. Hasten, ye weary pilgrims! The country is getting\r\n      up; noise of you is bruited day after day, a solitary Twelve\r\n      retreating in this mysterious manner: with every new day, a wider\r\n      wave of inquisitive pursuing tumult is stirred up till the whole\r\n      West will be in motion. “Cussy is tormented with gout, Buzot is\r\n      too fat for marching.” Riouffe, blistered, bleeding, marching\r\n      only on tiptoe; Barbaroux limps with sprained ancle, yet ever\r\n      cheery, full of hope and valour. Light Louvet glances hare-eyed,\r\n      not hare-hearted: only virtuous Pétion’s serenity “was but once\r\n      seen ruffled.”[668] They lie in straw-lofts, in woody brakes;\r\n      rudest paillasse on the floor of a secret friend is luxury. They\r\n      are seized in the dead of night by Jacobin mayors and tap of\r\n      drum; get off by firm countenance, rattle of muskets, and ready\r\n      wit.\r\n\r\n      Of Bourdeaux, through fiery La Vendée and the long geographical\r\n      spaces that remain, it were madness to think: well, if you can\r\n      get to Quimper on the sea-coast, and take shipping there. Faster,\r\n      ever faster! Before the end of the march, so hot has the country\r\n      grown, it is found advisable to march all night. They do it;\r\n      under the still night-canopy they plod along;—and yet behold,\r\n      Rumour has outplodded them. In the paltry Village of Carhaix (be\r\n      its thatched huts, and bottomless peat-bogs, long notable to the\r\n      Traveller), one is astonished to find light still glimmering:\r\n      citizens are awake, with rush-lights burning, in that nook of the\r\n      terrestrial Planet; as we traverse swiftly the one poor street, a\r\n      voice is heard saying, ‘There they are, _Les voilà qui\r\n      passent!_’[669] Swifter, ye doomed lame Twelve: speed ere they\r\n      can arm; gain the Woods of Quimper before day, and lie squatted\r\n      there!\r\n\r\n      The doomed Twelve do it; though with difficulty, with loss of\r\n      road, with peril, and the mistakes of a night. In Quimper are\r\n      Girondin friends, who perhaps will harbour the homeless, till a\r\n      Bourdeaux ship weigh. Wayworn, heartworn, in agony of suspense,\r\n      till Quimper friendship get warning, they lie there, squatted\r\n      under the thick wet boscage; suspicious of the face of man. Some\r\n      pity to the brave; to the unhappy! Unhappiest of all Legislators,\r\n      O when ye packed your luggage, some score, or two-score months\r\n      ago; and mounted this or the other leathern vehicle, to be\r\n      Conscript Fathers of a regenerated France, and reap deathless\r\n      laurels,—did ye think your journey was to lead _hither?_ The\r\n      Quimper Samaritans find them squatted; lift them up to help and\r\n      comfort; will hide them in sure places. Thence let them dissipate\r\n      gradually; or there they can lie quiet, and write _Memoirs_, till\r\n      a Bourdeaux ship sail.\r\n\r\n      And thus, in Calvados all is dissipated; Romme is out of prison,\r\n      meditating his Calendar; ringleaders are locked in his room. At\r\n      Caen the Corday family mourns in silence; Buzot’s House is a heap\r\n      of dust and demolition; and amid the rubbish sticks a Gallows,\r\n      with this inscription, _Here dwelt the Traitor Buzot who\r\n      conspired against the Republic_. Buzot and the other vanished\r\n      Deputies are _hors la loi_, as we saw; their lives free to take\r\n      where they can be found. The worse fares it with the poor\r\n      Arrested visible Deputies at Paris. “Arrestment at home”\r\n      threatens to become “Confinement in the Luxembourg;” to end:\r\n      _where?_ For example, what pale-visaged thin man is this,\r\n      journeying towards Switzerland as a Merchant of Neuchâtel, whom\r\n      they arrest in the town of Moulins? To Revolutionary Committee he\r\n      is suspect. To Revolutionary Committee, on probing the matter, he\r\n      is evidently: Deputy Brissot! Back to thy Arrestment, poor\r\n      Brissot; or indeed to strait confinement,—whither others are\r\n      fared to follow. Rabaut has built himself a false-partition, in a\r\n      friend’s house; lives, in invisible darkness, between two walls.\r\n      It will end, this same Arrestment business, in Prison, and the\r\n      Revolutionary Tribunal.\r\n\r\n      Nor must we forget Duperret, and the seal put on his papers by\r\n      reason of Charlotte. One Paper is there, fit to breed woe enough:\r\n      A secret solemn Protest against that _suprema dies_ of the Second\r\n      of June! This Secret Protest our poor Duperret had drawn up, the\r\n      same week, in all plainness of speech; waiting the time for\r\n      publishing it: to which Secret Protest his signature, and that of\r\n      other honourable Deputies not a few, stands legibly appended. And\r\n      now, if the seals were once broken, the Mountain still\r\n      victorious? Such Protestors, your Merciers, Bailleuls,\r\n      Seventy-three by the tale, what yet remains of Respectable\r\n      Girondism in the Convention, may tremble to think!—These are the\r\n      fruits of levying civil war.\r\n\r\n      Also we find, that, in these last days of July, the famed Siege\r\n      of Mentz is _finished;_ the Garrison to march out with honours of\r\n      war; not to serve against the Coalition for a year! Lovers of the\r\n      Picturesque, and Goethe standing on the Chaussée of Mentz, saw,\r\n      with due interest, the Procession issuing forth, in all\r\n      solemnity:\r\n\r\n      “Escorted by Prussian horse came first the French Garrison.\r\n      Nothing could look stranger than this latter: a column of\r\n      Marseillese, slight, swarthy, party-coloured, in patched clothes,\r\n      came tripping on;—as if King Edwin had opened the Dwarf Hill, and\r\n      sent out his nimble Host of Dwarfs. Next followed regular troops;\r\n      serious, sullen; not as if downcast or ashamed. But the\r\n      remarkablest appearance, which struck every one, was that of the\r\n      Chasers (_Chasseurs_) coming out mounted: they had advanced quite\r\n      silent to where we stood, when their Band struck up the\r\n      _Marseillaise_. This Revolutionary _Te-Deum_ has in itself\r\n      something mournful and bodeful, however briskly played; but at\r\n      present they gave it in altogether slow time, proportionate to\r\n      the creeping step they rode at. It was piercing and fearful, and\r\n      a most serious-looking thing, as these cavaliers, long, lean men,\r\n      of a certain age, with mien suitable to the music, came pacing\r\n      on: singly you might have likened them to Don Quixote; in mass,\r\n      they were highly dignified.\r\n\r\n      “But now a single troop became notable: that of the Commissioners\r\n      or _Représentans_. Merlin of Thionville, in hussar uniform,\r\n      distinguishing himself by wild beard and look, had another person\r\n      in similar costume on his left; the crowd shouted out, with rage,\r\n      at sight of this latter, the name of a Jacobin Townsman and\r\n      Clubbist; and shook itself to seize him. Merlin drew bridle;\r\n      referred to his dignity as French Representative, to the\r\n      vengeance that should follow any injury done; he would advise\r\n      every one to compose himself, for this was not the _last time_\r\n      they would see him here.[670] Thus rode Merlin; threatening in\r\n      defeat. But what now shall stem that tide of Prussians setting in\r\n      through the open North-East?” Lucky, if fortified Lines of\r\n      Weissembourg, and impassibilities of Vosges Mountains, confine it\r\n      to French Alsace, keep it from submerging the very heart of the\r\n      country!\r\n\r\n      Furthermore, precisely in the same days, Valenciennes Siege is\r\n      finished, in the North-West:—fallen, under the red hail of York!\r\n      Condé fell some fortnight since. Cimmerian Coalition presses on.\r\n      What seems very notable too, on all these captured French Towns\r\n      there flies not the Royalist fleur-de-lys, in the name of a new\r\n      Louis the Pretender; but the Austrian flag flies; as if Austria\r\n      meant to keep them for herself! Perhaps General Custines, still\r\n      in Paris, can give some explanation of the fall of these\r\n      strong-places? Mother Society, from tribune and gallery, growls\r\n      loud that he ought to do it;—remarks, however, in a splenetic\r\n      manner that “the _Monsieurs_ of the Palais Royal” are calling,\r\n      Long-life to this General.\r\n\r\n      The Mother Society, purged now, by successive “scrutinies or\r\n      _épurations_,” from all taint of Girondism, has become a great\r\n      Authority: what we can call shield-bearer, or bottle-holder, nay\r\n      call it fugleman, to the purged National Convention itself. The\r\n      Jacobins Debates are reported in the _Moniteur_, like\r\n      Parliamentary ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.IV.\r\n      O Nature.\r\n\r\n      But looking more specially into Paris City, what is this that\r\n      History, on the 10th of August, Year One of Liberty, “by\r\n      old-style, year 1793,” discerns there? Praised be the Heavens, a\r\n      new Feast of Pikes!\r\n\r\n      For Chaumette’s “Deputation every day” has worked out its result:\r\n      a Constitution. It was one of the rapidest Constitutions ever put\r\n      together; made, some say in eight days, by Hérault Séchelles and\r\n      others: probably a workmanlike, roadworthy Constitution\r\n      enough;—on which point, however, we are, for some reasons, little\r\n      called to form a judgment. Workmanlike or not, the Forty-four\r\n      Thousand Communes of France, by overwhelming majorities, did\r\n      hasten to accept it; glad of any Constitution whatsoever. Nay\r\n      Departmental Deputies have come, the venerablest Republicans of\r\n      each Department, with solemn message of Acceptance; and now what\r\n      remains but that our new Final Constitution be proclaimed, and\r\n      sworn to, in Feast of Pikes? The Departmental Deputies, we say,\r\n      are come some time ago;—Chaumette very anxious about them, lest\r\n      Girondin _Monsieurs_, Agio-jobbers, or were it even _Filles de\r\n      joie_ of a Girondin temper, corrupt their morals.[671] Tenth of\r\n      August, immortal Anniversary, greater almost than Bastille July,\r\n      is the Day.\r\n\r\n      Painter David has not been idle. Thanks to David and the French\r\n      genius, there steps forth into the sunlight, this day, a Scenic\r\n      Phantasmagory unexampled:—whereof History, so occupied with\r\n      Real-Phantasmagories, will say but little.\r\n\r\n      For one thing, History can notice with satisfaction, on the ruins\r\n      of the Bastille, a _Statue of Nature;_ gigantic, spouting water\r\n      from her two _mammelles_. Not a Dream this; but a Fact, palpable\r\n      visible. There she spouts, great Nature; dim, before daybreak.\r\n      But as the coming Sun ruddies the East, come countless\r\n      Multitudes, regulated and unregulated; come Departmental\r\n      Deputies, come Mother Society and Daughters; comes National\r\n      Convention, led on by handsome Herault; soft wind-music breathing\r\n      note of expectation. Lo, as great Sol scatters his first\r\n      fire-handful, tipping the hills and chimney-heads with gold,\r\n      Herault is at great Nature’s feet (she is Plaster of Paris\r\n      merely); Herault lifts, in an iron saucer, water spouted from the\r\n      sacred breasts; drinks of it, with an eloquent Pagan Prayer,\r\n      beginning, ‘O Nature!’ and all the Departmental Deputies drink,\r\n      each with what best suitable ejaculation or prophetic-utterance\r\n      is in him;—amid breathings, which become blasts, of wind-music;\r\n      and the roar of artillery and human throats: finishing well the\r\n      first act of this solemnity.\r\n\r\n      Next are processionings along the Boulevards: Deputies or\r\n      Officials bound together by long indivisible tricolor riband;\r\n      general “members of the Sovereign” walking pellmell, with pikes,\r\n      with hammers, with the tools and emblems of their crafts; among\r\n      which we notice a Plough, and ancient Baucis and Philemon seated\r\n      on it, drawn by their children. Many-voiced harmony and\r\n      dissonance filling the air. Through Triumphal Arches enough: at\r\n      the basis of the first of which, we descry—whom thinkest\r\n      thou?—the Heroines of the Insurrection of Women. Strong Dames of\r\n      the Market, they sit there (Théroigne too ill to attend, one\r\n      fears), with oak-branches, tricolor bedizenment; firm-seated on\r\n      their Cannons. To whom handsome Herault, making pause of\r\n      admiration, addresses soothing eloquence; whereupon they rise and\r\n      fall into the march.\r\n\r\n      And now mark, in the Place de la Révolution, what other August\r\n      Statue may this be; veiled in canvas,—which swiftly we shear off\r\n      by pulley and cord? The _Statue of Liberty!_ She too is of\r\n      plaster, hoping to become of metal; stands where a Tyrant Louis\r\n      Quinze once stood. “Three thousand birds” are let loose, into the\r\n      whole world, with labels round their neck, _We are free; imitate\r\n      us._ Holocaust of Royalist and _ci-devant_ trumpery, such as one\r\n      could still gather, is burnt; pontifical eloquence must be\r\n      uttered, by handsome Herault, and Pagan orisons offered up.\r\n\r\n      And then forward across the River; where is new enormous\r\n      Statuary; enormous plaster Mountain; Hercules-_Peuple_, with\r\n      uplifted all-conquering club; “many-headed Dragon of Girondin\r\n      Federalism rising from fetid marsh;”—needing new eloquence from\r\n      Herault. To say nothing of Champ-de-Mars, and Fatherland’s Altar\r\n      there; with urn of slain Defenders, Carpenter’s-level of the Law;\r\n      and such exploding, gesticulating and perorating, that Herault’s\r\n      lips must be growing white, and his tongue cleaving to the roof\r\n      of his mouth.[672]\r\n\r\n      Towards six-o’clock let the wearied President, let Paris\r\n      Patriotism generally sit down to what repast, and social repasts,\r\n      can be had; and with flowing tankard or light-mantling glass,\r\n      usher in this New and Newest Era. In fact, is not Romme’s New\r\n      Calendar getting ready? On all housetops flicker little tricolor\r\n      Flags, their flagstaff a Pike and Liberty-Cap. On all\r\n      house-walls, for no Patriot, not suspect, will be behind another,\r\n      there stand printed these words: _Republic one and indivisible,\r\n      Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death._\r\n\r\n      As to the New Calendar, we may say here rather than elsewhere\r\n      that speculative men have long been struck with the inequalities\r\n      and incongruities of the Old Calendar; that a New one has long\r\n      been as good as determined on. Maréchal the Atheist, almost ten\r\n      years ago, proposed a New Calendar, free at least from\r\n      superstition: this the Paris Municipality would now adopt, in\r\n      defect of a better; at all events, let us have either this of\r\n      Maréchal’s or a better,—the New Era being come. Petitions, more\r\n      than once, have been sent to that effect; and indeed, for a year\r\n      past, all Public Bodies, Journalists, and Patriots in general,\r\n      have dated _First Year of the Republic_. It is a subject not\r\n      without difficulties. But the Convention has taken it up; and\r\n      Romme, as we say, has been meditating it; not Maréchal’s New\r\n      Calendar, but a better New one of Romme’s and our own. Romme,\r\n      aided by a Monge, a Lagrange and others, furnishes mathematics;\r\n      Fabre d’Eglantine furnishes poetic nomenclature: and so, on the\r\n      5th of October 1793, after trouble enough, they bring forth this\r\n      New Republican Calendar of theirs, in a complete state; and by\r\n      Law, get it put in action.\r\n\r\n      Four equal Seasons, Twelve equal Months of thirty days each: this\r\n      makes three hundred and sixty days; and five odd days remain to\r\n      be disposed of. The five odd days we will make Festivals, and\r\n      name the five _Sansculottides_, or Days without Breeches.\r\n      Festival of Genius; Festival of Labour; of Actions; of Rewards;\r\n      of Opinion: these are the five Sansculottides. Whereby the great\r\n      Circle, or Year, is made complete: solely every fourth year,\r\n      whilom called Leap-year, we introduce a sixth Sansculottide; and\r\n      name it Festival of the Revolution. Now as to the day of\r\n      commencement, which offers difficulties, is it not one of the\r\n      luckiest coincidences that the Republic herself commenced on the\r\n      21st of September; close on the Vernal Equinox? Vernal Equinox,\r\n      at midnight for the meridian of Paris, in the year whilom\r\n      Christian 1792, from that moment shall the New Era reckon itself\r\n      to begin. _Vendémiaire, Brumaire, Frimaire;_ or as one might say,\r\n      in mixed English, _Vintagearious, Fogarious, Frostarious:_ these\r\n      are our three Autumn months. _Nivose, Pluviose, Ventose_, or say\r\n      _Snowous, Rainous, Windous_, make our Winter season. _Germinal,\r\n      Floréal, Prairial_, or _Buddal, Floweral, Meadowal_, are our\r\n      Spring season. _Messidor, Thermidor, Fructidor_, that is to say\r\n      (_dor_ being Greek for _gift_), _Reapidor, Heatidor, Fruitidor_,\r\n      are Republican Summer. These Twelve, in a singular manner, divide\r\n      the Republican Year. Then as to minuter subdivisions, let us\r\n      venture at once on a bold stroke: adopt your decimal subdivision;\r\n      and instead of world-old Week, or _Se’ennight_, make it a\r\n      _Tennight_ or _Décade;_—not without results. There are three\r\n      Decades, then, in each of the months; which is very regular; and\r\n      the _Decadi_, or Tenth-day, shall always be “the Day of Rest.”\r\n      And the Christian Sabbath, in that case? Shall shift for itself!\r\n\r\n      This, in brief, in this New Calendar of Romme and the Convention;\r\n      calculated for the meridian of Paris, and Gospel of Jean-Jacques:\r\n      not one of the least afflicting occurrences for the actual\r\n      British reader of French History;—confusing the soul with\r\n      _Messidors, Meadowals;_ till at last, in self-defence, one is\r\n      forced to construct some ground-scheme, or rule of Commutation\r\n      from New-style to Old-style, and have it lying by him. Such\r\n      ground-scheme, almost worn out in our service, but still legible\r\n      and printable, we shall now, in a Note, present to the reader.\r\n      For the Romme Calendar, in so many Newspapers, Memoirs, Public\r\n      Acts, has stamped itself deep into that section of Time: a New\r\n      Era that lasts some Twelve years and odd is not to be\r\n      despised.[673] Let the reader, therefore, with such\r\n      ground-scheme, help himself, where needful, out of New-style into\r\n      Old-style, called also “slave-style, _stile-esclave;_”—whereof\r\n      we, in these pages, shall as much as possible use the latter\r\n      only.\r\n\r\n      Thus with new Feast of Pikes, and New Era or New Calendar, did\r\n      France accept her New Constitution: the most Democratic\r\n      Constitution ever committed to paper. How it will work in\r\n      practice? Patriot Deputations from time to time solicit fruition\r\n      of it; that it be set a-going. Always, however, this seems\r\n      questionable; for the moment, unsuitable. Till, in some weeks,\r\n      _Salut Public_, through the organ of Saint-Just, makes report,\r\n      that, in the present alarming circumstances, the state of France\r\n      is Revolutionary; that her “Government must be Revolutionary till\r\n      the Peace!” Solely as Paper, then, and as a Hope, must this poor\r\n      New Constitution exist;—in which shape we may conceive it lying;\r\n      even now, with an infinity of other things, in that Limbo near\r\n      the Moon. Further than paper it never got, nor ever will get.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.V.\r\n      Sword of Sharpness.\r\n\r\n      In fact it is something quite other than paper theorems, it is\r\n      iron and audacity that France now needs.\r\n\r\n      Is not La Vendée still blazing;—alas too literally; rogue\r\n      Rossignol burning the very corn-mills? General Santerre could do\r\n      nothing there; General Rossignol, in blind fury, often in liquor,\r\n      can do less than nothing. Rebellion spreads, grows ever madder.\r\n      Happily those lean Quixote-figures, whom we saw retreating out of\r\n      Mentz, “bound not to serve against the Coalition for a year,”\r\n      have got to Paris. National Convention packs them into\r\n      post-vehicles and conveyances; sends them swiftly, by post, into\r\n      La Vendée! There valiantly struggling, in obscure battle and\r\n      skirmish, under rogue Rossignol, let them, unlaurelled, save the\r\n      Republic, and “be cut down gradually to the last man.”[674]\r\n\r\n      Does not the Coalition, like a fire-tide, pour in; Prussia\r\n      through the opened North-East; Austria, England through the\r\n      North-West? General Houchard prospers no better there than\r\n      General Custine did: let him look to it! Through the Eastern and\r\n      the Western Pyrenees Spain has deployed itself; spreads, rustling\r\n      with Bourbon banners, over the face of the South. Ashes and\r\n      embers of confused Girondin civil war covered that region\r\n      already. Marseilles is damped down, not quenched; to be quenched\r\n      in blood. Toulon, terrorstruck, too far gone for turning, has\r\n      flung itself, ye righteous Powers,—into the hands of the English!\r\n      On Toulon Arsenal there flies a Flag,—nay not even the\r\n      Fleur-de-lys of a Louis Pretender; there flies that accursed St.\r\n      George’s Cross of the English and Admiral Hood! What remnants of\r\n      sea-craft, arsenals, roperies, war-navy France had, has given\r\n      itself to these enemies of human nature, “_ennemis du genre\r\n      humain_.” Beleaguer it, bombard it, ye Commissioners Barras,\r\n      Fréron, Robespierre Junior; thou General Cartaux, General\r\n      Dugommier; above all, thou remarkable Artillery-Major, Napoleon\r\n      Buonaparte! Hood is fortifying himself, victualling himself;\r\n      means, apparently, to make a new Gibraltar of it.\r\n\r\n      But lo, in the Autumn night, late night, among the last of\r\n      August, what sudden red sunblaze is this that has risen over\r\n      Lyons City; with a noise to deafen the world? It is the\r\n      Powder-tower of Lyons, nay the Arsenal with four Powder-towers,\r\n      which has caught fire in the Bombardment; and sprung into the\r\n      air, carrying “a hundred and seventeen houses” after it. With a\r\n      light, one fancies, as of the noon sun; with a roar second only\r\n      to the Last Trumpet! All living sleepers far and wide it has\r\n      awakened. What a sight was that, which the eye of History saw, in\r\n      the sudden nocturnal sunblaze! The roofs of hapless Lyons, and\r\n      all its domes and steeples made momentarily clear; Rhone and\r\n      Saone streams flashing suddenly visible; and height and hollow,\r\n      hamlet and smooth stubblefield, and all the region\r\n      round;—heights, alas, all scarped and counterscarped, into\r\n      trenches, curtains, redouts; blue Artillery-men, little\r\n      Powder-devilkins, plying their hell-trade there, through the\r\n      _not_ ambrosial night! Let the darkness cover it again; for it\r\n      pains the eye. Of a truth, Chalier’s death is costing this City\r\n      dear. Convention Commissioners, Lyons Congresses have come and\r\n      gone; and action there was and reaction; bad ever growing worse;\r\n      till it has come to this: Commissioner Dubois-Crancé, “with\r\n      seventy thousand men, and all the Artillery of several\r\n      Provinces,” bombarding Lyons day and night.\r\n\r\n      Worse things still are in store. Famine is in Lyons, and ruin,\r\n      and fire. Desperate are the sallies of the besieged; brave Précy,\r\n      their National Colonel and Commandant, doing what is in man:\r\n      desperate but ineffectual. Provisions cut off; nothing entering\r\n      our city but shot and shells! The Arsenal has roared aloft; the\r\n      very Hospital will be battered down, and the sick buried alive. A\r\n      Black Flag hung on this latter noble Edifice, appealing to the\r\n      pity of the beseigers; for though maddened, were they not still\r\n      our brethren? In their blind wrath, they took it for a flag of\r\n      defiance, and aimed thitherward the more. Bad is growing ever\r\n      worse here: and how will the worse stop, till it have grown worst\r\n      of all? Commissioner Dubois will listen to no pleading, to no\r\n      speech, save this only, “We surrender at discretion.” Lyons\r\n      contains in it subdued Jacobins; dominant Girondins; secret\r\n      Royalists. And now, mere deaf madness and cannon-shot enveloping\r\n      them, will not the desperate Municipality fly, at last, into the\r\n      arms of Royalism itself? Majesty of Sardinia was to bring help,\r\n      but it failed. Emigrant Autichamp, in name of the Two Pretender\r\n      Royal Highnesses, is coming through Switzerland with help;\r\n      coming, not yet come: Précy hoists the Fleur-de-lys!\r\n\r\n      At sight of which, all true Girondins sorrowfully fling down\r\n      their arms:—Let our Tricolor brethren storm us, then, and slay us\r\n      in their wrath: with _you_ we conquer not. The famishing women\r\n      and children are sent forth: deaf Dubois sends them back;—rains\r\n      in mere fire and madness. Our “redouts of cotton-bags” are taken,\r\n      retaken; Précy under his Fleur-de-lys is valiant as Despair. What\r\n      will become of Lyons? It is a siege of seventy days.[675]\r\n\r\n      Or see, in these same weeks, far in the Western waters: breasting\r\n      through the Bay of Biscay, a greasy dingy little Merchantship,\r\n      with Scotch skipper; under hatches whereof sit, disconsolate,—the\r\n      last forlorn nucleus of Girondism, the Deputies from Quimper!\r\n      Several have dissipated themselves, whithersoever they could.\r\n      Poor Riouffe fell into the talons of Revolutionary Committee, and\r\n      Paris Prison. The rest sit here under hatches; reverend Pétion\r\n      with his grey hair, angry Buzot, suspicious Louvet, brave young\r\n      Barbaroux, and others. They have escaped from Quimper, in this\r\n      sad craft; are now tacking and struggling; in danger from the\r\n      waves, in danger from the English, in still worse danger from the\r\n      French;—banished by Heaven and Earth to the greasy belly of this\r\n      Scotch skipper’s Merchant-vessel, unfruitful Atlantic raving\r\n      round. They are for Bourdeaux, if peradventure hope yet linger\r\n      there. Enter not Bourdeaux, O Friends! Bloody Convention\r\n      Representatives, Tallien and such like, with their Edicts, with\r\n      their Guillotine, have arrived there; Respectability is driven\r\n      under ground; Jacobinism lords it on high. From that Réole\r\n      landingplace, or _Beak of Ambès_, as it were, Pale Death, waving\r\n      his Revolutionary Sword of sharpness, waves you elsewhither!\r\n\r\n      On one side or the other of that Bec d’Ambès, the Scotch Skipper\r\n      with difficulty moors, a dexterous greasy man; with difficulty\r\n      lands his Girondins;—who, after reconnoitring, must rapidly\r\n      burrow in the Earth; and so, in subterranean ways, in friends’\r\n      back-closets, in cellars, barn-lofts, in Caves of Saint-Emilion\r\n      and Libourne, stave off cruel Death.[676] Unhappiest of all\r\n      Senators!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.VI.\r\n      Risen against Tyrants.\r\n\r\n      Against all which incalculable impediments, horrors and\r\n      disasters, what can a Jacobin Convention oppose? The\r\n      uncalculating Spirit of Jacobinism, and Sansculottic\r\n      sans-formulistic Frenzy! Our Enemies press in on us, says Danton,\r\n      but they shall not conquer us, ‘we will burn France to ashes\r\n      rather, _nous brûlerons la France_.’\r\n\r\n      Committees, of _Sureté_ or _Salut_, have raised themselves “_à la\r\n      hauteur_, to the height of circumstances.” Let all mortals raise\r\n      themselves _à la hauteur_. Let the Forty-four thousand Sections\r\n      and their Revolutionary Committees stir every fibre of the\r\n      Republic; and every Frenchman feel that he is to do or die. They\r\n      are the life-circulation of Jacobinism, these Sections and\r\n      Committees: Danton, through the organ of Barrère and _Salut\r\n      Public_, gets decreed, That there be in Paris, by law, two\r\n      meetings of Section weekly; also, that the Poorer Citizen be\r\n      _paid_ for attending, and have his day’s-wages of Forty\r\n      Sous.[677] This is the celebrated “Law of the Forty Sous;”\r\n      fiercely stimulant to Sansculottism, to the life-circulation of\r\n      Jacobinism.\r\n\r\n      On the twenty-third of August, Committee of Public Salvation, as\r\n      usual through Barrère, had promulgated, in words not unworthy of\r\n      remembering, their Report, which is soon made into a Law, of\r\n      _Levy in Mass_. “All France, and whatsoever it contains of men or\r\n      resources, is put under requisition,” says Barrère; really in\r\n      Tyrtæan words, the best we know of his. “The Republic is one vast\r\n      besieged city.” Two hundred and fifty Forges shall, in these\r\n      days, be set up in the Luxembourg Garden, and round the outer\r\n      wall of the Tuileries; to make gun-barrels; in sight of Earth and\r\n      Heaven! From all hamlets, towards their Departmental Town; from\r\n      all their Departmental Towns, towards the appointed Camp and seat\r\n      of war, the Sons of Freedom shall march; their banner is to bear:\r\n      “_Le Peuple Français debout contres les Tyrans_, The French\r\n      People risen against Tyrants.” “The young men shall go to the\r\n      battle; it is their task to conquer: the married men shall forge\r\n      arms, transport baggage and artillery; provide subsistence: the\r\n      women shall work at soldiers’ clothes, make tents; serve in the\r\n      hospitals. The children shall scrape old-linen into\r\n      surgeon’s-lint: the aged men shall have themselves carried into\r\n      public places; and there, by their words, excite the courage of\r\n      the young; preach hatred to Kings and unity to the\r\n      Republic.”[678] Tyrtæan words, which tingle through all French\r\n      hearts.\r\n\r\n      In this humour, then, since no other serves, will France rush\r\n      against its enemies. Headlong, reckoning no cost or consequence;\r\n      heeding no law or rule but that supreme law, Salvation of the\r\n      People! The weapons are all the iron that is in France; the\r\n      strength is that of all the men, women and children that are in\r\n      France. There, in their two hundred and fifty shed-smithies, in\r\n      Garden of Luxembourg or Tuileries, let them forge gun-barrels, in\r\n      sight of Heaven and Earth.\r\n\r\n      Nor with heroic daring against the Foreign foe, can black\r\n      vengeance against the Domestic be wanting. Life-circulation of\r\n      the Revolutionary Committees being quickened by that _Law of the\r\n      Forty Sous_, Deputy Merlin, not the Thionviller, whom we saw ride\r\n      out of Mentz, but Merlin of Douai, named subsequently Merlin\r\n      _Suspect_,—comes, about a week after, with his world-famous _Law\r\n      of the Suspect:_ ordering all Sections, by their Committees,\r\n      instantly to arrest all Persons Suspect; and explaining withal\r\n      who the Arrestable and Suspect specially are. ‘Are Suspect,’ says\r\n      he, ‘all who by their actions, by their connexions, speakings,\r\n      writings have’—in short become Suspect.[679] Nay Chaumette,\r\n      illuminating the matter still further, in his Municipal Placards\r\n      and Proclamations, will bring it about that you may almost\r\n      recognise a Suspect on the streets, and clutch him there,—off to\r\n      Committee, and Prison. Watch well your words, watch well your\r\n      looks: if Suspect of nothing else, you may grow, as came to be a\r\n      saying, “Suspect of being Suspect!” For are we not in a State of\r\n      Revolution?\r\n\r\n      No frightfuller Law ever ruled in a Nation of men. All Prisons\r\n      and Houses of Arrest in French land are getting crowded to the\r\n      ridge-tile: Forty-four thousand Committees, like as many\r\n      companies of reapers or gleaners, gleaning France, are gathering\r\n      their harvest, and storing it in these Houses. Harvest of\r\n      Aristocrat tares! Nay, lest the Forty-four thousand, each on its\r\n      own harvest-field, prove insufficient, we are to have an ambulant\r\n      “Revolutionary Army:” six thousand strong, under right captains,\r\n      this shall perambulate the country at large, and strike in\r\n      wherever it finds such harvest-work slack. So have Municipality\r\n      and Mother Society petitioned; so has Convention decreed.[680]\r\n      Let Aristocrats, Federalists, Monsieurs vanish, and all men\r\n      tremble: “The Soil of Liberty shall be purged,”—with a vengeance!\r\n\r\n      Neither hitherto has the Revolutionary Tribunal been keeping\r\n      holyday. Blanchelande, for losing Saint-Domingo; “Conspirators of\r\n      Orleans,” for “assassinating,” for assaulting the sacred Deputy\r\n      Leonard-Bourdon: these with many Nameless, to whom life was\r\n      sweet, have died. Daily the great Guillotine has its due. Like a\r\n      black Spectre, daily at eventide, glides the Death-tumbril\r\n      through the variegated throng of things. The variegated street\r\n      shudders at it, for the moment; next moment forgets it: The\r\n      Aristocrats! They were guilty against the Republic; their death,\r\n      were it only that their goods are confiscated, will be useful to\r\n      the Republic; _Vive la République!_\r\n\r\n      In the last days of August, fell a notabler head: General\r\n      Custine’s. Custine was accused of harshness, of unskilfulness,\r\n      perfidiousness; accused of many things: found guilty, we may say,\r\n      of one thing, unsuccessfulness. Hearing his unexpected Sentence,\r\n      “Custine fell down before the Crucifix,” silent for the space of\r\n      two hours: he fared, with moist eyes and a book of prayer,\r\n      towards the Place de la Révolution; glanced upwards at the clear\r\n      suspended axe; then mounted swiftly aloft,[681] swiftly was\r\n      struck away from the lists of the Living. He had fought in\r\n      America; he was a proud, brave man; and his fortune led him\r\n      _hither_.\r\n\r\n      On the 2nd of this same month, at three in the morning, a vehicle\r\n      rolled off, with closed blinds, from the Temple to the\r\n      Conciergerie. Within it were two Municipals; and\r\n      Marie-Antoinette, once Queen of France! There in that\r\n      Conciergerie, in ignominious dreary cell, she, cut off from\r\n      children, kindred, friend and hope, sits long weeks; expecting\r\n      when the end will be.[682]\r\n\r\n      The Guillotine, we find, gets always a quicker motion, as other\r\n      things are quickening. The Guillotine, by its speed of going,\r\n      will give index of the general velocity of the Republic. The\r\n      clanking of its huge axe, rising and falling there, in horrid\r\n      systole-diastole, is portion of the whole enormous Life-movement\r\n      and pulsation of the Sansculottic System!—“Orléans Conspirators”\r\n      and Assaulters had to die, in spite of much weeping and\r\n      entreating; so sacred is the person of a Deputy. Yet the sacred\r\n      can become desecrated: your very Deputy is not greater than the\r\n      Guillotine. Poor Deputy Journalist Gorsas: we saw him hide at\r\n      Rennes, when the Calvados War burnt priming. He stole afterwards,\r\n      in August, to Paris; lurked several weeks about the Palais\r\n      _ci-devant_ Royal; was seen there, one day; was clutched,\r\n      identified, and without ceremony, being already “out of the Law,”\r\n      was sent to the Place de la Révolution. He died, recommending his\r\n      wife and children to the pity of the Republic. It is the ninth\r\n      day of October 1793. Gorsas is the first Deputy that dies on the\r\n      scaffold; he will not be the last.\r\n\r\n      Ex-Mayor Bailly is in prison; Ex-Procureur Manuel. Brissot and\r\n      our poor Arrested Girondins have become Incarcerated Indicted\r\n      Girondins; universal Jacobinism clamouring for their punishment.\r\n      Duperret’s Seals are _broken!_ Those Seventy-three Secret\r\n      Protesters, suddenly one day, are reported upon, are decreed\r\n      accused; the Convention-doors being “previously shut,” that none\r\n      implicated might escape. They were marched, in a very rough\r\n      manner, to Prison that evening. Happy those of them who chanced\r\n      to be absent! Condorcet has vanished into darkness; perhaps, like\r\n      Rabaut, sits between two walls, in the house of a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.VII.\r\n      Marie-Antoinette.\r\n\r\n      On Monday the Fourteenth of October, 1793, a Cause is pending in\r\n      the Palais de Justice, in the new Revolutionary Court, such as\r\n      these old stone-walls never witnessed: the Trial of\r\n      Marie-Antoinette. The once brightest of Queens, now tarnished,\r\n      defaced, forsaken, stands here at Fouquier Tinville’s\r\n      Judgment-bar; answering for her life! The Indictment was\r\n      delivered her last night.[683] To such changes of human fortune\r\n      what words are adequate? Silence alone is adequate.\r\n\r\n      There are few Printed things one meets with, of such tragic\r\n      almost ghastly significance as those bald Pages of the _Bulletin\r\n      du Tribunal Révolutionnaire_, which bear title, _Trial of the\r\n      Widow Capet_. Dim, dim, as if in disastrous eclipse; like the\r\n      pale kingdoms of Dis! Plutonic Judges, Plutonic Tinville;\r\n      encircled, nine times, with Styx and Lethe, with Fire-Phlegethon\r\n      and Cocytus named of Lamentation! The very witnesses summoned are\r\n      like Ghosts: exculpatory, inculpatory, they themselves are all\r\n      hovering over death and doom; they are known, in our imagination,\r\n      as the prey of the Guillotine. Tall _ci-devant_ Count d’Estaing,\r\n      anxious to shew himself Patriot, cannot escape; nor Bailly, who,\r\n      when asked If he knows the Accused, answers with a reverent\r\n      inclination towards her, ‘Ah, yes, I know Madame.’ Ex-Patriots\r\n      are here, sharply dealt with, as Procureur Manuel; Ex-Ministers,\r\n      shorn of their splendour. We have cold Aristocratic impassivity,\r\n      faithful to itself even in Tartarus; rabid stupidity, of Patriot\r\n      Corporals, Patriot Washerwomen, who have much to say of Plots,\r\n      Treasons, August Tenth, old Insurrection of Women. For all now\r\n      has become a crime, in her who has _lost_.\r\n\r\n      Marie-Antoinette, in this her utter abandonment and hour of\r\n      extreme need, is not wanting to herself, the imperial woman. Her\r\n      look, they say, as that hideous Indictment was reading, continued\r\n      calm; “she was sometimes observed moving her fingers, as when one\r\n      plays on the Piano.” You discern, not without interest, across\r\n      that dim Revolutionary Bulletin itself, how she bears herself\r\n      queenlike. Her answers are prompt, clear, often of Laconic\r\n      brevity; resolution, which has grown contemptuous without ceasing\r\n      to be dignified, veils itself in calm words. ‘You persist then in\r\n      denial?’—‘My plan is not denial: it is the truth I have said, and\r\n      I persist in that.’ Scandalous Hébert has borne his testimony as\r\n      to many things: as to one thing, concerning Marie-Antoinette and\r\n      her little Son,—wherewith Human Speech had better not further be\r\n      soiled. She has answered Hébert; a Juryman begs to observe that\r\n      she has not answered as to this. ‘I have not answered,’ she\r\n      exclaims with noble emotion, ‘because Nature refuses to answer\r\n      such a charge brought against a Mother. I appeal to all the\r\n      Mothers that are here.’ Robespierre, when he heard of it, broke\r\n      out into something almost like swearing at the brutish\r\n      blockheadism of this Hébert;[684] on whose foul head his foul lie\r\n      has recoiled. At four o’clock on Wednesday morning, after two\r\n      days and two nights of interrogating, jury-charging, and other\r\n      darkening of counsel, the result comes out: Sentence of Death.\r\n      ‘Have you anything to say?’ The Accused shook her head, without\r\n      speech. Night’s candles are burning out; and with her too Time is\r\n      finishing, and it will be Eternity and Day. This Hall of\r\n      Tinville’s is dark, ill-lighted except where she stands. Silently\r\n      she withdraws from it, to die.\r\n\r\n      Two Processions, or Royal Progresses, three-and-twenty years\r\n      apart, have often struck us with a strange feeling of contrast.\r\n      The first is of a beautiful Archduchess and Dauphiness, quitting\r\n      her Mother’s City, at the age of Fifteen; towards hopes such as\r\n      no other Daughter of Eve then had: “On the morrow,” says Weber an\r\n      eye witness, “the Dauphiness left Vienna. The whole City crowded\r\n      out; at first with a sorrow which was silent. She appeared: you\r\n      saw her sunk back into her carriage; her face bathed in tears;\r\n      hiding her eyes now with her handkerchief, now with her hands;\r\n      several times putting out her head to see yet again this Palace\r\n      of her Fathers, whither she was to return no more. She motioned\r\n      her regret, her gratitude to the good Nation, which was crowding\r\n      here to bid her farewell. Then arose not only tears; but piercing\r\n      cries, on all sides. Men and women alike abandoned themselves to\r\n      such expression of their sorrow. It was an audible sound of wail,\r\n      in the streets and avenues of Vienna. The last Courier that\r\n      followed her disappeared, and the crowd melted away.”[685]\r\n\r\n      The young imperial Maiden of Fifteen has now become a worn\r\n      discrowned Widow of Thirty-eight; grey before her time: this is\r\n      the last Procession: “Few minutes after the Trial ended, the\r\n      drums were beating to arms in all Sections; at sunrise the armed\r\n      force was on foot, cannons getting placed at the extremities of\r\n      the Bridges, in the Squares, Crossways, all along from the Palais\r\n      de Justice to the Place de la Révolution. By ten o’clock,\r\n      numerous patrols were circulating in the Streets; thirty thousand\r\n      foot and horse drawn up under arms. At eleven, Marie-Antoinette\r\n      was brought out. She had on an undress of _piqué blanc:_ she was\r\n      led to the place of execution, in the same manner as an ordinary\r\n      criminal; bound, on a Cart; accompanied by a Constitutional\r\n      Priest in Lay dress; escorted by numerous detachments of infantry\r\n      and cavalry. These, and the double row of troops all along her\r\n      road, she appeared to regard with indifference. On her\r\n      countenance there was visible neither abashment nor pride. To the\r\n      cries of _Vive la République_ and _Down with Tyranny_, which\r\n      attended her all the way, she seemed to pay no heed. She spoke\r\n      little to her Confessor. The tricolor Streamers on the housetops\r\n      occupied her attention, in the Streets du Roule and Saint-Honoré;\r\n      she also noticed the Inscriptions on the house-fronts. On\r\n      reaching the Place de la Révolution, her looks turned towards the\r\n      _Jardin National_, whilom Tuileries; her face at that moment gave\r\n      signs of lively emotion. She mounted the Scaffold with courage\r\n      enough; at a quarter past Twelve, her head fell; the Executioner\r\n      shewed it to the people, amid universal long-continued cries of\r\n      “_Vive la République_.”[686]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.4.VIII.\r\n      The Twenty-two.\r\n\r\n      Whom next, O Tinville? The next are of a different colour: our\r\n      poor Arrested Girondin Deputies. What of them could still be laid\r\n      hold of; our Vergniaud, Brissot, Fauchet, Valazé, Gensonné; the\r\n      once flower of French Patriotism, Twenty-two by the tale:\r\n      _hither_, at Tinville’s Bar, onward from “safeguard of the French\r\n      People,” from confinement in the Luxembourg, imprisonment in the\r\n      Conciergerie, have they now, by the course of things, arrived.\r\n      Fouquier Tinville must give what account of them he can.\r\n\r\n      Undoubtedly this Trial of the Girondins is the greatest that\r\n      Fouquier has yet had to do. Twenty-two, all chief Republicans,\r\n      ranged in a line there; the most eloquent in France; Lawyers too;\r\n      not without friends in the auditory. How will Tinville prove\r\n      these men guilty of Royalism, Federalism, Conspiracy against the\r\n      Republic? Vergniaud’s eloquence awakes once more; “draws tears,”\r\n      they say. And Journalists report, and the Trial lengthens itself\r\n      out day after day; “threatens to become eternal,” murmur many.\r\n      Jacobinism and Municipality rise to the aid of Fouquier. On the\r\n      28th of the month, Hébert and others come in deputation to inform\r\n      a Patriot Convention that the Revolutionary Tribunal is quite\r\n      “shackled by forms of Law;” that a Patriot Jury ought to have\r\n      “the power of cutting short, of _terminer les débats_, when they\r\n      feel themselves convinced.” Which pregnant suggestion, of cutting\r\n      short, passes itself, with all despatch, into a Decree.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, at ten o’clock on the night of the 30th of October,\r\n      the Twenty-two, summoned back once more, receive this\r\n      information, That the Jury feeling themselves convinced have cut\r\n      short, have brought in their verdict; that the Accused are found\r\n      guilty, and the Sentence on one and all of them is Death with\r\n      confiscation of goods.\r\n\r\n      Loud natural clamour rises among the poor Girondins; tumult;\r\n      which can only be repressed by the gendarmes. Valazé stabs\r\n      himself; falls down dead on the spot. The rest, amid loud clamour\r\n      and confusion, are driven back to their Conciergerie; Lasource\r\n      exclaiming, ‘I die on the day when the People have lost their\r\n      reason; ye will die when they recover it.’[687] No help! Yielding\r\n      to violence, the Doomed uplift the Hymn of the Marseillese;\r\n      return singing to their dungeon.\r\n\r\n      Riouffe, who was their Prison-mate in these last days, has\r\n      lovingly recorded what death they made. To our notions, it is not\r\n      an edifying death. Gay satirical _Pot-pourri_ by Ducos; rhymed\r\n      Scenes of Tragedy, wherein Barrère and Robespierre discourse with\r\n      Satan; death’s eve spent in “singing” and “sallies of gaiety,”\r\n      with “discourses on the happiness of peoples:” these things, and\r\n      the like of these, we have to accept for what they are worth. It\r\n      is the manner in which the Girondins make _their_ Last Supper.\r\n      Valazé, with bloody breast, sleeps cold in death; hears not their\r\n      singing. Vergniaud has his dose of poison; but it is not enough\r\n      for his friends, it is enough only for himself; wherefore he\r\n      flings it from him; presides at this Last Supper of the\r\n      Girondins, with wild coruscations of eloquence, with song and\r\n      mirth. Poor human Will struggles to assert itself; if not in this\r\n      way, then in that.[688]\r\n\r\n      But on the morrow morning all Paris is out; such a crowd as no\r\n      man had seen. The Death-carts, Valazé’s cold corpse stretched\r\n      among the yet living Twenty-one, roll along. Bareheaded, hands\r\n      bound; in their shirt-sleeves, coat flung loosely round the neck:\r\n      so fare the eloquent of France; bemurmured, beshouted. To the\r\n      shouts of _Vive la République_, some of them keep answering with\r\n      counter-shouts of _Vive la République_. Others, as Brissot, sit\r\n      sunk in silence. At the foot of the scaffold they again strike\r\n      up, with appropriate variations, the Hymn of the Marseillese.\r\n      Such an act of music; conceive it well! The yet Living chant\r\n      there; the chorus so rapidly wearing weak! Samson’s axe is rapid;\r\n      one head per minute, or little less. The chorus is worn out;\r\n      farewell for evermore ye Girondins. Te-Deum Fauchet has become\r\n      silent; Valazé’s dead head is lopped: the sickle of the\r\n      Guillotine has reaped the Girondins all away. “The eloquent, the\r\n      young, the beautiful and brave!” exclaims Riouffe. O Death, what\r\n      feast is toward in thy ghastly Halls?\r\n\r\n      Nor alas, in the far Bourdeaux region, will Girondism fare\r\n      better. In caves of Saint-Emilion, in loft and cellar, the\r\n      weariest months, roll on; apparel worn, purse empty; wintry\r\n      November come; under Tallien and his Guillotine, all hope now\r\n      gone. Danger drawing ever nigher, difficulty pressing ever\r\n      straiter, they determine to separate. Not unpathetic the\r\n      farewell; tall Barbaroux, cheeriest of brave men, stoops to clasp\r\n      his Louvet: ‘In what place soever thou findest my mother,’ cries\r\n      he, ‘try to be instead of a son to her: no resource of mine but I\r\n      will share with thy Wife, should chance ever lead me where she\r\n      is.’[689]\r\n\r\n      Louvet went with Guadet, with Salles and Valady; Barbaroux with\r\n      Buzot and Pétion. Valady soon went southward, on a way of his\r\n      own. The two friends and Louvet had a miserable day and night;\r\n      the 14th of November month, 1793. Sunk in wet, weariness and\r\n      hunger, they knock, on the morrow, for help, at a friend’s\r\n      country-house; the fainthearted friend refuses to admit them.\r\n      They stood therefore under trees, in the pouring rain. Flying\r\n      desperate, Louvet thereupon will to Paris. He sets forth, there\r\n      and then, splashing the mud on each side of him, with a fresh\r\n      strength gathered from fury or frenzy. He passes villages,\r\n      finding “the sentry asleep in his box in the thick rain;” he is\r\n      gone, before the man can call after him. He bilks Revolutionary\r\n      Committees; rides in carriers’ carts, covered carts and open;\r\n      lies hidden in one, under knapsacks and cloaks of soldiers’ wives\r\n      on the Street of Orléans, while men search for him: has\r\n      hairbreadth escapes that would fill three romances: finally he\r\n      gets to Paris to his fair Helpmate; gets to Switzerland, and\r\n      waits better days.\r\n\r\n      Poor Guadet and Salles were both taken, ere long; they died by\r\n      the Guillotine in Bourdeaux; drums beating to drown their voice.\r\n      Valady also is caught, and guillotined. Barbaroux and his two\r\n      comrades weathered it longer, into the summer of 1794; but not\r\n      long enough. One July morning, changing their hiding place, as\r\n      they have often to do, “about a league from Saint-Emilion, they\r\n      observe a great crowd of country-people;” doubtless Jacobins come\r\n      to take them? Barbaroux draws a pistol, shoots himself dead.\r\n      Alas, and it was not Jacobins; it was harmless villagers going to\r\n      a village wake. Two days afterwards, Buzot and Pétion were found\r\n      in a Cornfield, their bodies half-eaten with dogs.[690]\r\n\r\n      Such was the end of Girondism. They arose to regenerate France,\r\n      these men; and have accomplished _this_. Alas, whatever quarrel\r\n      we had with them, has not their cruel fate abolished it? Pity\r\n      only survives. So many excellent souls of heroes sent down to\r\n      Hades; they themselves given as a prey of dogs and all manner of\r\n      birds! But, here too, the will of the Supreme Power was\r\n      accomplished. As Vergniaud said: “The Revolution, like Saturn, is\r\n      devouring its own children.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 3.V.\r\n      TERROR THE ORDER OF THE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.I.\r\n      Rushing down.\r\n\r\n      We are now, therefore, got to that black precipitous Abyss;\r\n      whither all things have long been tending; where, having now\r\n      arrived on the giddy verge, they hurl down, in confused ruin;\r\n      headlong, pellmell, down, down;—till Sansculottism have\r\n      consummated itself; and in this wondrous French Revolution, as in\r\n      a Doomsday, a World have been rapidly, if not born again, yet\r\n      destroyed and engulphed. Terror has long been terrible: but to\r\n      the actors themselves it has now become manifest that their\r\n      appointed course is one of Terror; and they say, Be it so. ‘_Que\r\n      la Terreur soit a l’ordre du jour_.’\r\n\r\n      So many centuries, say only from Hugh Capet downwards, had been\r\n      adding together, century transmitting it with increase to\r\n      century, the sum of Wickedness, of Falsehood, Oppression of man\r\n      by man. Kings were sinners, and Priests were, and People.\r\n      Open-Scoundrels rode triumphant, bediademed, becoronetted,\r\n      bemitred; or the still fataller species of Secret-Scoundrels, in\r\n      their fair-sounding formulas, speciosities, respectabilities,\r\n      hollow within: the race of Quacks was grown many as the sands of\r\n      the sea. Till at length such a sum of Quackery had accumulated\r\n      itself as, in brief, the Earth and the Heavens were weary of.\r\n      Slow seemed the Day of Settlement: coming on, all imperceptible,\r\n      across the bluster and fanfaronade of Courtierisms,\r\n      Conquering-Heroisms, Most-Christian _Grand Monarque_-isms.\r\n      Well-beloved Pompadourisms: yet behold it was always coming;\r\n      behold it has come, suddenly, unlooked for by any man! The\r\n      harvest of long centuries was ripening and whitening so rapidly\r\n      of late; and now it is grown _white_, and is reaped rapidly, as\r\n      it were, in one day. Reaped, in this Reign of Terror; and carried\r\n      home, to Hades and the Pit!—Unhappy Sons of Adam: it is ever so;\r\n      and never do they know it, nor will they know it. With cheerfully\r\n      smoothed countenances, day after day, and generation after\r\n      generation, they, calling cheerfully to one another,\r\n      ‘Well-speed-ye,’ are at work, _sowing the wind_. And yet, as God\r\n      lives, they _shall reap the whirlwind:_ no other thing, we say,\r\n      is possible,—since God is a Truth and His World is a Truth.\r\n\r\n      History, however, in dealing with this Reign of Terror, has had\r\n      her own difficulties. While the Phenomenon continued in its\r\n      primary state, as mere “Horrors of the French Revolution,” there\r\n      was abundance to be said and shrieked. With and also without\r\n      profit. Heaven knows there were terrors and horrors enough: yet\r\n      that was not all the Phenomenon; nay, more properly, that was not\r\n      the Phenomenon at all, but rather was the _shadow_ of it, the\r\n      negative part of it. And now, in a new stage of the business,\r\n      when History, ceasing to shriek, would try rather to include\r\n      under her old Forms of speech or speculation this new amazing\r\n      Thing; that so some accredited scientific Law of Nature might\r\n      suffice for the unexpected Product of Nature, and History might\r\n      get to speak of it articulately, and draw inferences and profit\r\n      from it; in this new stage, History, we must say, babbles and\r\n      flounders perhaps in a still painfuller manner. Take, for\r\n      example, the latest Form of speech we have seen propounded on the\r\n      subject as adequate to it, almost in these months, by our worthy\r\n      M. Roux, in his _Histoire Parlementaire_. The latest and the\r\n      strangest: that the French Revolution was a dead-lift effort,\r\n      after eighteen hundred years of preparation, to realise—the\r\n      Christian Religion![691] _Unity, Indivisibility, Brotherhood or\r\n      Death_ did indeed stand printed on all Houses of the Living;\r\n      also, on Cemeteries, or Houses of the Dead, stood printed, by\r\n      order of Procureur Chaumette, Here is eternal Sleep:[692] but a\r\n      Christian Religion realised by the Guillotine and Death-Eternal,\r\n      “is suspect to me,” as Robespierre was wont to say, “_m’est\r\n      suspecte._”\r\n\r\n      Alas, no, M. Roux! A Gospel of Brotherhood, not according to any\r\n      of the Four old Evangelists, and calling on men to repent, and\r\n      amend _each his own_ wicked existence, that they might be saved;\r\n      but a Gospel rather, as we often hint, according to a new Fifth\r\n      Evangelist Jean-Jacques, calling on men to amend _each the whole\r\n      world’s_ wicked existence, and be saved by making the\r\n      Constitution. A thing different and distant _toto cœlo_, as they\r\n      say: the whole breadth of the sky, and further if possible!—It is\r\n      thus, however, that History, and indeed all human Speech and\r\n      Reason does yet, what Father Adam began life by doing: strive to\r\n      _name_ the new Things it sees of Nature’s producing,—often\r\n      helplessly enough.\r\n\r\n      But what if History were to admit, for once, that all the Names\r\n      and Theorems yet known to her fall short? That this grand Product\r\n      of Nature was even grand, and new, in that it came not to range\r\n      itself under old recorded Laws-of-Nature at all; but to disclose\r\n      new ones? In that case, History renouncing the pretention to\r\n      _name_ it at present, will _look_ honestly at it, and name what\r\n      she can of it! Any approximation to the right Name has value:\r\n      were the right name itself once here, the Thing is known\r\n      thenceforth; the Thing is then ours, and can be dealt with.\r\n\r\n      Now surely not realization, of Christianity, or of aught earthly,\r\n      do we discern in this Reign of Terror, in this French Revolution\r\n      of which it is the consummating. Destruction rather we discern—of\r\n      all that was destructible. It is as if Twenty-five millions,\r\n      risen at length into the Pythian mood, had stood up\r\n      simultaneously to say, with a sound which goes through far lands\r\n      and times, that this Untruth of an Existence had become\r\n      insupportable. O ye Hypocrisies and Speciosities, Royal mantles,\r\n      Cardinal plushcloaks, ye Credos, Formulas, Respectabilities,\r\n      fair-painted Sepulchres full of dead men’s bones,—behold, ye\r\n      appear to us to be altogether a Lie. Yet our Life is not a Lie;\r\n      yet our Hunger and Misery is not a Lie! Behold we lift up, one\r\n      and all, our Twenty-five million right-hands; and take the\r\n      Heavens, and the Earth and also the Pit of Tophet to witness,\r\n      that either ye shall be abolished, or else we shall be abolished!\r\n\r\n      No inconsiderable Oath, truly; forming, as has been often said,\r\n      the most remarkable transaction in these last thousand years.\r\n      Wherefrom likewise there follow, and will follow, results. The\r\n      fulfilment of this Oath; that is to say, the black desperate\r\n      battle of Men against their whole Condition and Environment,—a\r\n      battle, alas, withal, against the Sin and Darkness that was in\r\n      themselves as in others: this is the Reign of Terror.\r\n      Transcendental despair was the purport of it, though not\r\n      consciously so. False hopes, of Fraternity, Political Millennium,\r\n      and what not, we have always seen: but the unseen heart of the\r\n      whole, the transcendental despair, was not false; neither has it\r\n      been of no effect. Despair, pushed far enough, completes the\r\n      circle, so to speak; and becomes a kind of genuine productive\r\n      hope again.\r\n\r\n      Doctrine of Fraternity, out of old Catholicism, does, it is true,\r\n      very strangely in the vehicle of a Jean-Jacques Evangel, suddenly\r\n      plump down out of its cloud-firmament; and from a theorem\r\n      determine to make itself a practice. But just so do all creeds,\r\n      intentions, customs, knowledges, thoughts and things, which the\r\n      French have, suddenly plump down; Catholicism, Classicism,\r\n      Sentimentalism, Cannibalism: all _isms_ that make up Man in\r\n      France, are rushing and roaring in that gulf; and the theorem has\r\n      become a practice, and whatsoever cannot swim sinks. Not\r\n      Evangelist Jean-Jacques alone; there is not a Village\r\n      Schoolmaster but has contributed his quota: do we not _thou_ one\r\n      another, according to the Free Peoples of Antiquity? The French\r\n      Patriot, in red phrygian nightcap of Liberty, christens his poor\r\n      little red infant Cato,—Censor, or else of Utica. Gracchus has\r\n      become Baboeuf and edits Newspapers; Mutius Scaevola, Cordwainer\r\n      of that ilk, presides in the Section Mutius-Scaevola: and in\r\n      brief, there is a world wholly jumbling itself, to try what will\r\n      swim!\r\n\r\n      Wherefore we will, at all events, call this Reign of Terror a\r\n      very strange one. Dominant Sansculottism makes, as it were, free\r\n      arena; one of the strangest temporary states Humanity was ever\r\n      seen in. A nation of men, full of wants and void of habits! The\r\n      old habits are gone to wreck because they were old: men, driven\r\n      forward by Necessity and fierce Pythian Madness, have, on the\r\n      spur of the instant, to devise for the want the _way_ of\r\n      satisfying it. The wonted tumbles down; by imitation, by\r\n      invention, the Unwonted hastily builds itself up. What the French\r\n      National head has in it comes out: if not a great result, surely\r\n      one of the strangest.\r\n\r\n      Neither shall the reader fancy that it was all blank, this Reign\r\n      of Terror: far from it. How many hammermen and squaremen, bakers\r\n      and brewers, washers and wringers, over this France, must ply\r\n      their old daily work, let the Government be one of Terror or one\r\n      of Joy! In this Paris there are Twenty-three Theatres nightly;\r\n      some count as many as Sixty Places of Dancing.[693] The\r\n      Playwright manufactures: pieces of a strictly Republican\r\n      character. Ever fresh Novelgarbage, as of old, fodders the\r\n      Circulating Libraries.[694] The “Cesspool of _Agio_,” now in the\r\n      time of Paper Money, works with a vivacity unexampled,\r\n      unimagined; exhales from itself “sudden fortunes,” like\r\n      Alladin-Palaces: really a kind of miraculous Fata-Morganas, since\r\n      you _can_ live in them, for a time. Terror is as a sable ground,\r\n      on which the most variegated of scenes paints itself. In\r\n      startling transitions, in colours all intensated, the sublime,\r\n      the ludicrous, the horrible succeed one another; or rather, in\r\n      crowding tumult, accompany one another.\r\n\r\n      Here, accordingly, if anywhere, the “hundred tongues,” which the\r\n      old Poets often clamour for, were of supreme service! In defect\r\n      of any such organ on our part, let the Reader stir up his own\r\n      imaginative organ: let us snatch for him this or the other\r\n      significant glimpse of things, in the fittest sequence we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.II.\r\n      Death.\r\n\r\n      In the early days of November, there is one transient glimpse of\r\n      things that is to be noted: the last transit to his long home of\r\n      Philippe d’Orléans Egalité. Philippe was “decreed accused,” along\r\n      with the Girondins, much to his and their surprise; but not tried\r\n      along with them. They are doomed and dead, some three days, when\r\n      Philippe, after his long half-year of durance at Marseilles,\r\n      arrives in Paris. It is, as we calculate, the third of November\r\n      1793.\r\n\r\n      On which same day, two notable Female Prisoners are also put in\r\n      ward there: Dame Dubarry and Josephine Beauharnais! Dame whilom\r\n      Countess Dubarry, Unfortunate-female, had returned from London;\r\n      they snatched her, not only as Ex-harlot of a whilom Majesty, and\r\n      therefore suspect; but as having “furnished the Emigrants with\r\n      money.” Contemporaneously with whom, there comes the wife of\r\n      Beauharnais, soon to be the widow: she that is Josephine Tascher\r\n      Beauharnais; that shall be Josephine Empress Buonaparte, for a\r\n      black Divineress of the Tropics prophesied long since that she\r\n      should be a Queen and more. Likewise, in the same hours, poor\r\n      Adam Lux, nigh turned in the head, who, according to Foster, “has\r\n      taken no food these three weeks,” marches to the Guillotine for\r\n      his Pamphlet on Charlotte Corday: he “sprang to the scaffold;”\r\n      said he “died for her with great joy.” Amid such\r\n      fellow-travellers does Philippe arrive. For, be the month named\r\n      Brumaire year 2 of Liberty, or November year 1793 of Slavery, the\r\n      Guillotine goes always, _Guillotine va toujours_.\r\n\r\n      Enough, Philippe’s indictment is soon drawn, his jury soon\r\n      convinced. He finds himself made guilty of Royalism, Conspiracy\r\n      and much else; nay, it is a guilt in him that he voted Louis’s\r\n      Death, though he answers, ‘I voted in my soul and conscience.’\r\n      The doom he finds is death forthwith; this present sixth dim day\r\n      of November is the last day that Philippe is to see. Philippe,\r\n      says Montgaillard, thereupon called for breakfast: sufficiency of\r\n      “oysters, two cutlets, best part of an excellent bottle of\r\n      claret;” and consumed the same with apparent relish. A\r\n      Revolutionary Judge, or some official Convention Emissary, then\r\n      arrived, to signify that he might still do the State some service\r\n      by revealing the truth about a plot or two. Philippe answered\r\n      that, on him, in the pass things had come to, the State had, he\r\n      thought, small claim; that nevertheless, in the interest of\r\n      Liberty, he, having still some leisure on his hands, was willing,\r\n      were a reasonable question asked him, to give reasonable answer.\r\n      And so, says Montgaillard, he lent his elbow on the mantel-piece,\r\n      and conversed in an under-tone, with great seeming composure;\r\n      till the leisure was done, or the Emissary went his ways.\r\n\r\n      At the door of the Conciergerie, Philippe’s attitude was erect\r\n      and easy, almost commanding. It is five years, all but a few\r\n      days, since Philippe, within these same stone walls, stood up\r\n      with an air of graciosity, and asked King Louis, ‘Whether it was\r\n      a Royal Session, then, or a Bed of Justice?’ O Heaven!—Three poor\r\n      blackguards were to ride and die with him: some say, they\r\n      objected to such company, and had to be flung in, neck and\r\n      heels;[695] but it seems not true. Objecting or not objecting,\r\n      the gallows-vehicle gets under way. Philippe’s dress is remarked\r\n      for its elegance; greenfrock, waistcoat of white _piqué_, yellow\r\n      buckskins, boots clear as Warren: his air, as before, entirely\r\n      composed, impassive, not to say easy and Brummellean-polite.\r\n      Through street after street; slowly, amid execrations;—past the\r\n      Palais Egalité whilom Palais-Royal! The cruel Populace stopped\r\n      him there, some minutes: Dame de Buffon, it is said, looked out\r\n      on him, in Jezebel head-tire; along the ashlar Wall, there ran\r\n      these words in huge tricolor print, REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE;\r\n      LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY OR DEATH: _National Property_.\r\n      Philippe’s eyes flashed hellfire, one instant; but the next\r\n      instant it was gone, and he sat impassive, Brummellean-polite. On\r\n      the scaffold, Samson was for drawing of his boots: ‘tush,’ said\r\n      Philippe, ‘they will come better off _after;_ let us have done,\r\n      _dépêchons-nous!_’\r\n\r\n      So Philippe was not without virtue, then? God forbid that there\r\n      should be any living man without it! He had the virtue to keep\r\n      living for five-and-forty years;—other virtues perhaps more than\r\n      we know of. Probably no mortal ever had such things recorded of\r\n      him: such facts, and also such lies. For he was a _Jacobin Prince\r\n      of the Blood;_ consider what a combination! Also, unlike any\r\n      Nero, any Borgia, he lived in the Age of Pamphlets. Enough for\r\n      us: Chaos _has_ reabsorbed him; may it late or never bear his\r\n      like again!—Brave young Orleans Egalité, deprived of all, only\r\n      not deprived of himself, is gone to Coire in the Grisons, under\r\n      the name of Corby, to teach Mathematics. The Egalité Family is at\r\n      the darkest depths of the Nadir.\r\n\r\n      A far nobler Victim follows; one who will claim remembrance from\r\n      several centuries: Jeanne-Marie Phlipon, the Wife of Roland.\r\n      Queenly, sublime in her uncomplaining sorrow, seemed she to\r\n      Riouffe in her Prison. “Something more than is usually found in\r\n      the looks of women painted itself,” says Riouffe,[696] “in those\r\n      large black eyes of hers, full of expression and sweetness. She\r\n      spoke to me often, at the Grate: we were all attentive round her,\r\n      in a sort of admiration and astonishment; she expressed herself\r\n      with a purity, with a harmony and prosody that made her language\r\n      like music, of which the ear could never have enough. Her\r\n      conversation was serious, not cold; coming from the mouth of a\r\n      beautiful woman, it was frank and courageous as that of a great\r\n      men.” “And yet her maid said: ‘Before you, she collects her\r\n      strength; but in her own room, she will sit three hours\r\n      sometimes, leaning on the window, and weeping.’” She had been in\r\n      Prison, liberated once, but recaptured the same hour, ever since\r\n      the first of June: in agitation and uncertainty; which has\r\n      gradually settled down into the last stern certainty, that of\r\n      death. In the Abbaye Prison, she occupied Charlotte Corday’s\r\n      apartment. Here in the Conciergerie, she speaks with Riouffe,\r\n      with Ex-Minister Clavière; calls the beheaded Twenty-two ‘_Nos\r\n      amis_, our Friends,’—whom we are soon to follow. During these\r\n      five months, those _Memoirs_ of hers were written, which all the\r\n      world still reads.\r\n\r\n      But now, on the 8th of November, “clad in white,” says Riouffe,\r\n      “with her long black hair hanging down to her girdle,” she is\r\n      gone to the Judgment Bar. She returned with a quick step; lifted\r\n      her finger, to signify to us that she was doomed: her eyes seemed\r\n      to have been wet. Fouquier-Tinville’s questions had been\r\n      “brutal;” offended female honour flung them back on him, with\r\n      scorn, not without tears. And now, short preparation soon done,\r\n      she shall go her last road. There went with her a certain\r\n      Lamarche, “Director of Assignat printing;” whose dejection she\r\n      endeavoured to cheer. Arrived at the foot of the scaffold, she\r\n      asked for pen and paper, ‘to write the strange thoughts that were\r\n      rising in her;’[697] a remarkable request; which was refused.\r\n      Looking at the Statue of Liberty which stands there, she says\r\n      bitterly: ‘O Liberty, what things are done in thy name!’ For\r\n      Lamarche’s sake, she will die first; shew him how easy it is to\r\n      die: ‘Contrary to the order’ said Samson.—‘Pshaw, you cannot\r\n      refuse the last request of a Lady;’ and Samson yielded.\r\n\r\n      Noble white Vision, with its high queenly face, its soft proud\r\n      eyes, long black hair flowing down to the girdle; and as brave a\r\n      heart as ever beat in woman’s bosom! Like a white Grecian Statue,\r\n      serenely complete, she shines in that black wreck of things;—long\r\n      memorable. Honour to great Nature who, in Paris City, in the Era\r\n      of Noble-Sentiment and Pompadourism, can make a Jeanne Phlipon,\r\n      and nourish her to clear perennial Womanhood, though but on\r\n      Logics, _Encyclopédies_, and the Gospel according to\r\n      Jean-Jacques! Biography will long remember that trait of asking\r\n      for a pen ‘to write the strange thoughts that were rising in\r\n      her.’ It is as a little light-beam, shedding softness, and a kind\r\n      of sacredness, over all that preceded: so in her too there was an\r\n      Unnameable; she too was a Daughter of the Infinite; there were\r\n      mysteries which Philosophism had not dreamt of!—She left long\r\n      written counsels to her little Girl; she said her Husband would\r\n      not survive her.\r\n\r\n      Still crueller was the fate of poor Bailly, First National\r\n      President, First Mayor of Paris: doomed now for Royalism,\r\n      Fayettism; for that Red-Flag Business of the Champ-de-Mars;—one\r\n      may say in general, for leaving his Astronomy to meddle with\r\n      Revolution. It is the 10th of November 1793, a cold bitter\r\n      drizzling rain, as poor Bailly is led through the streets;\r\n      howling Populace covering him with curses, with mud; waving over\r\n      his face a burning or smoking mockery of a Red Flag. Silent,\r\n      unpitied, sits the innocent old man. Slow faring through the\r\n      sleety drizzle, they have got to the Champ-de-Mars: Not there!\r\n      vociferates the cursing Populace; Such blood ought not to stain\r\n      an Altar of the Fatherland; not there; but on that dungheap by\r\n      the River-side! So vociferates the cursing Populace; Officiality\r\n      gives ear to them. The Guillotine is taken down, though with\r\n      hands numbed by the sleety drizzle; is carried to the River-side,\r\n      is there set up again, with slow numbness; pulse after pulse\r\n      still counting itself out in the old man’s weary heart. For hours\r\n      long; amid curses and bitter frost-rain! ‘Bailly, thou\r\n      tremblest,’ said one. ‘_Mon ami_, it is for cold,’ said Bailly,\r\n      ‘_c’est de froid_.’ Crueller end had no mortal.[698]\r\n\r\n      Some days afterwards, Roland hearing the news of what happened on\r\n      the 8th, embraces his kind Friends at Rouen, leaves their kind\r\n      house which had given him refuge; goes forth, with farewell too\r\n      sad for tears. On the morrow morning, 16th of the month, “some\r\n      four leagues from Rouen, Paris-ward, near Bourg-Baudoin, in M.\r\n      Normand’s Avenue,” there is seen sitting leant against a tree,\r\n      the figure of rigorous wrinkled man; stiff now in the rigour of\r\n      death; a cane-sword run through his heart; and at his feet this\r\n      writing: “Whoever thou art that findest me lying, respect my\r\n      remains: they are those of a man who consecrated all his life to\r\n      being useful; and who has died as he lived, virtuous and honest.”\r\n      “Not fear, but indignation, made me quit my retreat, on learning\r\n      that my Wife had been murdered. I wished not to remain longer on\r\n      an Earth polluted with crimes.”[699]\r\n\r\n      Barnave’s appearance at the Revolutionary Tribunal was of the\r\n      bravest; but it could not stead him. They have sent for him from\r\n      Grenoble; to pay the common smart, Vain is eloquence, forensic or\r\n      other, against the dumb Clotho-shears of Tinville. He is still\r\n      but two-and-thirty, this Barnave, and has known such changes.\r\n      Short while ago, we saw him at the top of Fortune’s Wheel, his\r\n      word a law to all Patriots: and now surely he is at the _bottom_\r\n      of the Wheel; in stormful altercation with a Tinville Tribunal,\r\n      which is dooming him to die![700] And Pétion, once also of the\r\n      Extreme Left, and named _Pétion Virtue_, where is he? Civilly\r\n      dead; in the Caves of Saint-Emilion; to be devoured of dogs. And\r\n      Robespierre, who rode along with him on the shoulders of the\r\n      people, is in Committee of _Salut;_ civilly alive: not to live\r\n      always. So giddy-swift whirls and spins this immeasurable\r\n      _tormentum_ of a Revolution; wild-booming; not to be followed by\r\n      the eye. Barnave, on the Scaffold, stamped his foot; and looking\r\n      upwards was heard to ejaculate, ‘This then is my reward?’\r\n\r\n      Deputy Ex-Procureur Manuel is already gone; and Deputy Osselin,\r\n      famed also in August and September, is about to go: and Rabaut,\r\n      discovered treacherously between his two walls, and the Brother\r\n      of Rabaut. National Deputies not a few! And Generals: the memory\r\n      of General Custine cannot be defended by his Son; his Son is\r\n      already guillotined. Custine the Ex-Noble was replaced by\r\n      Houchard the Plebeian: he too could not prosper in the North; for\r\n      him too there was no mercy; he has perished in the Place de la\r\n      Revolution, after attempting suicide in Prison. And Generals\r\n      Biron, Beauharnais, Brunet, whatsoever General prospers not;\r\n      tough old Lückner, with his eyes grown rheumy; Alsatian\r\n      Westermann, valiant and diligent in La Vendée: _none of them\r\n      can_, as the Psalmist sings, _his soul from death deliver_.\r\n\r\n      How busy are the Revolutionary Committees; Sections with their\r\n      Forty Halfpence a-day! Arrestment on arrestment falls quick,\r\n      continual; followed by death. Ex-Minister Clavière has killed\r\n      himself in Prison. Ex-Minister Lebrun, seized in a hayloft, under\r\n      the disguise of a working man, is instantly conducted to\r\n      death.[701] Nay, withal, is it not what Barrère calls “coining\r\n      money on the Place de la Révolution?” For always the “property of\r\n      the guilty, if property he have,” is confiscated. To avoid\r\n      accidents, we even make a Law that suicide shall not defraud us;\r\n      that a criminal who kills himself does not the less incur\r\n      forfeiture of goods. Let the guilty tremble, therefore, and the\r\n      suspect, and the rich, and in a word all manner of culottic men!\r\n      Luxembourg Palace, once Monsieur’s, has become a huge loathsome\r\n      Prison; Chantilly Palace too, once Condé’s:—and their Landlords\r\n      are at Blankenberg, on the wrong side of the Rhine. In Paris are\r\n      now some Twelve Prisons; in France some Forty-four Thousand:\r\n      thitherward, thick as brown leaves in Autumn, rustle and travel\r\n      the suspect; shaken down by Revolutionary Committees, they are\r\n      swept thitherward, as into their storehouse,—to be consumed by\r\n      Samson and Tinville. “The Guillotine goes not ill, _ La\r\n      Guillotine ne va pas mal_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.III.\r\n      Destruction.\r\n\r\n      The suspect may well tremble; but how much more the open\r\n      rebels;—the Girondin Cities of the South! Revolutionary Army is\r\n      gone forth, under Ronsin the Playwright; six thousand strong; in\r\n      “red nightcap, in tricolor waistcoat, in black-shag trousers,\r\n      black-shag spencer, with enormous moustachioes, enormous\r\n      sabre,—in _carmagnole complète;_”[702] and has portable\r\n      guillotines. Representative Carrier has got to Nantes, by the\r\n      edge of blazing La Vendée, which Rossignol has literally set on\r\n      fire: Carrier will try what captives you make, what accomplices\r\n      they have, Royalist or Girondin: his guillotine goes always, _va\r\n      toujours;_ and his wool-capped “Company of Marat.” Little\r\n      children are guillotined, and aged men. Swift as the machine is,\r\n      it will not serve; the Headsman and all his valets sink, worn\r\n      down with work; declare that the human muscles can no more.[703]\r\n      Whereupon you must try fusillading; to which perhaps still\r\n      frightfuller methods may succeed.\r\n\r\n      In Brest, to like purpose, rules Jean-Bon Saint-André; with an\r\n      Army of Red Nightcaps. In Bourdeaux rules Tallien, with his\r\n      Isabeau and henchmen: Guadets, Cussys, Salleses, may fall; the\r\n      bloody Pike and Nightcap bearing supreme sway; the Guillotine\r\n      coining money. Bristly fox-haired Tallien, once Able Editor,\r\n      still young in years, is now become most gloomy, potent; a Pluto\r\n      on Earth, and has the keys of Tartarus. One remarks, however,\r\n      that a certain Senhorina Cabarus, or call her rather _Senhora_\r\n      and wedded not yet widowed _Dame de Fontenai_, brown beautiful\r\n      woman, daughter of Cabarus the Spanish merchant,—has softened the\r\n      red bristly countenance; pleading for herself and friends; and\r\n      prevailing. The keys of Tartarus, or any kind of power, are\r\n      something to a woman; gloomy Pluto himself is not insensible to\r\n      love. Like a new Proserpine, she, by this red gloomy Dis, is\r\n      gathered; and, they say, softens his stone heart a little.\r\n\r\n      Maignet, at Orange in the South; Lebon, at Arras in the North,\r\n      become world’s wonders. Jacobin Popular Tribunal, with its\r\n      National Representative, perhaps where Girondin Popular Tribunal\r\n      had lately been, rises here and rises there; wheresoever needed.\r\n      Fouchés, Maignets, Barrases, Frérons scour the Southern\r\n      Departments; like reapers, with their guillotine-sickle. Many are\r\n      the labourers, great is the harvest. By the hundred and the\r\n      thousand, men’s lives are cropt; cast like brands into the\r\n      burning.\r\n\r\n      Marseilles is taken, and put under martial law: lo, at\r\n      Marseilles, what one besmutted red-bearded corn-ear is this which\r\n      they cut;—one gross Man, we mean, with copper-studded face;\r\n      plenteous beard, or beard-stubble, of a tile-colour? By Nemesis\r\n      and the Fatal Sisters, it is Jourdan Coupe-tête! Him they have\r\n      clutched, in these martial-law districts; him too, with their\r\n      “national razor,” their _rasoir national_, they sternly shave\r\n      away. Low now is Jourdan the Headsman’s own head;—low as\r\n      Deshuttes’s and Varigny’s, which he sent on pikes, in the\r\n      Insurrection of Women! No more shall he, as a copper Portent, be\r\n      seen gyrating through the Cities of the South; no more sit\r\n      judging, with pipes and brandy, in the Ice-tower of Avignon. The\r\n      all-hiding Earth has received him, the bloated Tilebeard: may we\r\n      never look upon his like again!—Jourdan one names; the other\r\n      Hundreds are not named. Alas, they, like confused faggots, lie\r\n      massed together for us; counted by the cartload: and yet not an\r\n      individual faggot-twig of them but had a Life and History; and\r\n      was cut, not without pangs as when a Kaiser dies!\r\n\r\n      Least of all cities can Lyons escape. Lyons, which we saw in\r\n      dread sunblaze, that Autumn night when the Powder-tower sprang\r\n      aloft, was clearly verging towards a sad end. Inevitable: what\r\n      could desperate valour and Précy do; Dubois-Crancé, deaf as\r\n      Destiny, stern as Doom, capturing their “redouts of cotton-bags;”\r\n      hemming them in, ever closer, with his Artillery-lava? Never\r\n      would that _ci-devant_ d’Autichamp arrive; never any help from\r\n      Blankenberg. The Lyons Jacobins were hidden in cellars; the\r\n      Girondin Municipality waxed pale, in famine, treason and red\r\n      fire. Précy drew his sword, and some Fifteen Hundred with him;\r\n      sprang to saddle, to cut their way to Switzerland. They cut\r\n      fiercely; and were fiercely cut, and cut down; not hundreds,\r\n      hardly units of them ever saw Switzerland.[704] Lyons, on the 9th\r\n      of October, surrenders at discretion; it is become a devoted\r\n      Town. Abbé Lamourette, now Bishop Lamourette, whilom Legislator,\r\n      he of the old _Baiser-l’Amourette_ or Delilah-Kiss, is seized\r\n      here, is sent to Paris to be guillotined: “he made the sign of\r\n      the cross,” they say when Tinville intimated his death-sentence\r\n      to him; and died as an eloquent Constitutional Bishop. But wo now\r\n      to all Bishops, Priests, Aristocrats and Federalists that are in\r\n      Lyons! The _manes_ of Chalier are to be appeased; the Republic,\r\n      maddened to the Sibylline pitch, has bared her right arm. Behold!\r\n      Representative Fouché, it is Fouché of Nantes, a name to become\r\n      well known; he with a Patriot company goes duly, in wondrous\r\n      Procession, to raise the corpse of Chalier. An Ass, housed in\r\n      Priest’s cloak, with a mitre on its head, and trailing the\r\n      Mass-Books, some say the very Bible, at its tail, paces through\r\n      Lyons streets; escorted by multitudinous Patriotism, by clangour\r\n      as of the Pit; towards the grave of Martyr Chalier. The body is\r\n      dug up and burnt: the ashes are collected in an Urn; to be\r\n      worshipped of Paris Patriotism. The Holy Books were part of the\r\n      funeral pile; their ashes are scattered to the wind. Amid cries\r\n      of ‘Vengeance! Vengeance!’—which, writes Fouché, shall be\r\n      satisfied.[705]\r\n\r\n      Lyons in fact is a Town to be abolished; not Lyons henceforth but\r\n      “_Commune Affranchie_, Township Freed;” the very name of it shall\r\n      perish. It is to be razed, this once great City, if Jacobinism\r\n      prophesy right; and a Pillar to be erected on the ruins, with\r\n      this Inscription, _Lyons rebelled against the Republic; Lyons is\r\n      no more_. Fouché, Couthon, Collot, Convention Representatives\r\n      succeed one another: there is work for the hangman; work for the\r\n      hammerman, _not_ in building. The very Houses of Aristocrats, we\r\n      say, are doomed. Paralytic Couthon, borne in a chair, taps on the\r\n      wall, with emblematic mallet, saying, ‘_La Loi te frappe_, The\r\n      Law strikes thee;’ masons, with wedge and crowbar, begin\r\n      demolition. Crash of downfall, dim ruin and dust-clouds fly in\r\n      the winter wind. Had Lyons been of soft stuff, it had all\r\n      vanished in those weeks, and the Jacobin prophecy had been\r\n      fulfilled. But Towns are not built of soap-froth; Lyons Town is\r\n      built of stone. Lyons, though it rebelled against the Republic,\r\n      _is_ to this day.\r\n\r\n      Neither have the Lyons Girondins all one neck, that you could\r\n      despatch it at one swoop. Revolutionary Tribunal here, and\r\n      Military Commission, guillotining, fusillading, do what they can:\r\n      the kennels of the Place des Terreaux run red; mangled corpses\r\n      roll down the Rhone. Collot d’Herbois, they say, was once hissed\r\n      on the Lyons stage: but with what sibilation, of world-catcall or\r\n      hoarse Tartarean Trumpet, will ye hiss him now, in this his new\r\n      character of Convention Representative,—not to be repeated! Two\r\n      hundred and nine men are marched forth over the River, to be shot\r\n      in mass, by musket and cannon, in the Promenade of the Brotteaux.\r\n      It is the second of such scenes; the first was of some Seventy.\r\n      The corpses of the first were flung into the Rhone, but the Rhone\r\n      stranded some; so these now, of the second lot, are to be buried\r\n      on land. Their one long grave is dug; they stand ranked, by the\r\n      loose mould-ridge; the younger of them singing the Marseillaise.\r\n      Jacobin National Guards give fire; but have again to give fire,\r\n      and again; and to take the bayonet and the spade, for though the\r\n      doomed all fall, they do not all die;—and it becomes a butchery\r\n      too horrible for speech. So that the very Nationals, as they\r\n      fire, turn away their faces. Collot, snatching the musket from\r\n      one such National, and levelling it with unmoved countenance,\r\n      says ‘It is thus a Republican ought to fire.’\r\n\r\n      This is the second Fusillade, and happily the last: it is found\r\n      too hideous; even inconvenient. They were Two hundred and nine\r\n      marched out; one escaped at the end of the Bridge: yet behold,\r\n      when you count the corpses, they are Two hundred and _ten_. Rede\r\n      us this riddle, O Collot? After long guessing, it is called to\r\n      mind that two individuals, here in the Brotteaux ground, did\r\n      attempt to leave the rank, protesting with agony that they were\r\n      not condemned men, that they were Police Commissaries: which two\r\n      we repulsed, and disbelieved, and shot with the rest![706] Such\r\n      is the vengeance of an enraged Republic. Surely this, according\r\n      to Barrère’s phrase, is Justice “under rough forms, _sous des\r\n      formes acerbes_.” But the Republic, as Fouché says, must ‘march\r\n      to Liberty over corpses.’ Or again as Barrère has it: ‘None but\r\n      the dead do not come back, _Il n’y a que les morts qui ne\r\n      reviennent pas_.’ Terror hovers far and wide: “The Guillotine\r\n      goes not ill.”\r\n\r\n      But before quitting those Southern regions, over which History\r\n      can cast only glances from aloft, she will alight for a moment,\r\n      and look fixedly at one point: the Siege of Toulon. Much\r\n      battering and bombarding, heating of balls in furnaces or\r\n      farm-houses, serving of artillery well and ill, attacking of\r\n      Ollioules Passes, Forts Malbosquet, there has been: as yet to\r\n      small purpose. We have had General Cartaux here, a whilom Painter\r\n      elevated in the troubles of Marseilles; General Doppet, a whilom\r\n      Medical man elevated in the troubles of Piemont, who, under\r\n      Crancé, took Lyons, but cannot take Toulon. Finally we have\r\n      General Dugommier, a pupil of Washington. Convention\r\n      _Représentans_ also we have had; Barrases, Salicettis,\r\n      Robespierres the Younger:—also an Artillery _Chef de brigade_, of\r\n      extreme diligence, who often takes his nap of sleep among the\r\n      guns; a short taciturn, olive-complexioned young man, not unknown\r\n      to us, by name Buonaparte: one of the best Artillery-officers yet\r\n      met with. And still Toulon is not taken. It is the fourth month\r\n      now; December, in slave-style; _Frostarious_ or _Frimaire_, in\r\n      new-style: and still their cursed Red-Blue Flag flies there. They\r\n      are provisioned from the Sea; they have seized all heights,\r\n      felling wood, and fortifying themselves; like the coney, they\r\n      have built their nest in the rocks.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, _Frostarious_ is not yet become _Snowous_ or _Nivose_,\r\n      when a Council of War is called; Instructions have just arrived\r\n      from Government and _Salut Public_. Carnot, in _Salut Public_,\r\n      has sent us a plan of siege: on which plan General Dugommier has\r\n      this criticism to make, Commissioner Salicetti has that; and\r\n      criticisms and plans are very various; when that young Artillery\r\n      Officer ventures to speak; the same whom we saw snatching sleep\r\n      among the guns, who has emerged several times in this\r\n      History,—the name of him Napoleon Buonaparte. It is his humble\r\n      opinion, for he has been gliding about with spy-glasses, with\r\n      thoughts, That a certain Fort l’Eguillette can be clutched, as\r\n      with lion-spring, on the sudden; wherefrom, were it once ours,\r\n      the very heart of Toulon might be battered, the English Lines\r\n      were, so to speak, turned inside out, and Hood and our Natural\r\n      Enemies must next day either put to sea, or be burnt to ashes.\r\n      Commissioners arch their eyebrows, with negatory sniff: who is\r\n      this young gentleman with more wit than we all? Brave veteran\r\n      Dugommier, however, thinks the idea worth a word; questions the\r\n      young gentleman; becomes convinced; and there is for issue, Try\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n      On the taciturn bronze-countenance, therefore, things being now\r\n      all ready, there sits a grimmer gravity than ever, compressing a\r\n      hotter central-fire than ever. Yonder, thou seest, is Fort\r\n      l’Eguillette; a desperate lion-spring, yet a possible one; this\r\n      day to be tried!—Tried it is; and found _good_. By stratagem and\r\n      valour, stealing through ravines, plunging fiery through the\r\n      fire-tempest, Fort l’Eguillette is clutched at, is carried; the\r\n      smoke having cleared, wiser the Tricolor fly on it: the\r\n      bronze-complexioned young man was right. Next morning, Hood,\r\n      finding the interior of his lines exposed, his defences turned\r\n      inside out, makes for his shipping. Taking such Royalists as\r\n      wished it on board with him, he weighs anchor: on this 19th of\r\n      December 1793, Toulon is once more the Republic’s!\r\n\r\n      Cannonading has ceased at Toulon; and now the guillotining and\r\n      fusillading may begin. Civil horrors, truly: but at least that\r\n      infamy of an English domination is purged away. Let there be\r\n      Civic Feast universally over France: so reports Barrère, or\r\n      Painter David; and the Convention assist in a body.[707] Nay, it\r\n      is said, these infamous English (with an attention rather to\r\n      their own interests than to ours) set fire to our store-houses,\r\n      arsenals, warships in Toulon Harbour, before weighing; some score\r\n      of brave warships, the only ones we now had! However, it did not\r\n      prosper, though the flame spread far and high; some two ships\r\n      were burnt, not more; the very galley-slaves ran with buckets to\r\n      quench. These same proud Ships, Ships _l’Orient_ and the rest,\r\n      have to carry this same young Man to Egypt first: not yet can\r\n      they be changed to ashes, or to Sea-Nymphs; not yet to\r\n      sky-rockets, O Ship _l’Orient_, nor became the prey of\r\n      England,—before their time!\r\n\r\n      And so, over France universally, there is Civic Feast and\r\n      high-tide: and Toulon sees fusillading, grape-shotting in mass,\r\n      as Lyons saw; and “death is poured out in great floods, _vomie à\r\n      grands flots_” and Twelve thousand Masons are requisitioned from\r\n      the neighbouring country, to raze Toulon from the face of the\r\n      Earth. For it is to be razed, so reports Barrère; all but the\r\n      National Shipping Establishments; and to be called henceforth not\r\n      Toulon, but _Port of the Mountain_. There in black death-cloud we\r\n      must leave it;—hoping only that Toulon too is built of stone;\r\n      that perhaps even Twelve thousand Masons cannot pull it down,\r\n      till the fit pass.\r\n\r\n      One begins to be sick of “death vomited in great floods.”\r\n      Nevertheless hearest thou not, O reader (for the sound reaches\r\n      through centuries), in the dead December and January nights, over\r\n      Nantes Town,—confused noises, as of musketry and tumult, as of\r\n      rage and lamentation; mingling with the everlasting moan of the\r\n      Loire waters there? Nantes Town is sunk in sleep; but\r\n      _Représentant_ Carrier is not sleeping, the wool-capped Company\r\n      of Marat is not sleeping. Why unmoors that flatbottomed craft,\r\n      that _gabarre;_ about eleven at night; with Ninety Priests under\r\n      hatches? They are going to Belle Isle? In the middle of the Loire\r\n      stream, on signal given, the gabarre is scuttled; she sinks with\r\n      all her cargo. “Sentence of Deportation,” writes Carrier, “was\r\n      executed _vertically_.” The Ninety Priests, with their\r\n      gabarre-coffin, lie deep! It is the first of the _Noyades_, what\r\n      we may call _Drownages_, of Carrier; which have become famous\r\n      forever.\r\n\r\n      Guillotining there was at Nantes, till the Headsman sank worn\r\n      out: then fusillading “in the Plain of Saint-Mauve;” little\r\n      children fusilladed, and women with children at the breast;\r\n      children and women, by the hundred and twenty; and by the five\r\n      hundred, so hot is La Vendée: till the very Jacobins grew sick,\r\n      and all but the Company of Marat cried, Hold! Wherefore now we\r\n      have got Noyading; and on the 24th night of _Frostarious_ year 2,\r\n      which is 14th of December 1793, we have a second Noyade:\r\n      consisting of “a Hundred and Thirty-eight persons.”[708]\r\n\r\n      Or why waste a gabarre, sinking it with them? Fling them out;\r\n      fling them out, with their hands tied: pour a continual hail of\r\n      lead over all the space, till the last struggler of them be sunk!\r\n      Unsound sleepers of Nantes, and the Sea-Villages thereabouts,\r\n      hear the musketry amid the night-winds; wonder what the meaning\r\n      of it is. And women were in that gabarre; whom the Red Nightcaps\r\n      were stripping naked; who begged, in their agony, that their\r\n      smocks might not be stript from them. And young children were\r\n      thrown in, their mothers vainly pleading: ‘Wolflings,’ answered\r\n      the Company of Marat, ‘who would grow to be wolves.’\r\n\r\n      By degrees, daylight itself witnesses Noyades: women and men are\r\n      tied together, feet and feet, hands and hands: and flung in: this\r\n      they call _Mariage Républicain_, Republican Marriage. Cruel is\r\n      the panther of the woods, the she-bear bereaved of her whelps:\r\n      but there is in man a hatred crueller than that. Dumb, out of\r\n      suffering now, as pale swoln corpses, the victims tumble\r\n      confusedly seaward along the Loire stream; the tide rolling them\r\n      back: clouds of ravens darken the River; wolves prowl on the\r\n      shoal-places: Carrier writes, “_Quel torrent révolutionnaire_,\r\n      What a torrent of Revolution!” For the man is rabid; and the Time\r\n      is rabid. These are the Noyades of Carrier; twenty-five by the\r\n      tale, for what is done in darkness comes to be investigated in\r\n      sunlight:[709] not to be forgotten for centuries,—We will turn to\r\n      another aspect of the Consummation of Sansculottism; leaving this\r\n      as the blackest.\r\n\r\n      But indeed men are all rabid; as the Time is. Representative\r\n      Lebon, at Arras, dashes his sword into the blood flowing from the\r\n      Guillotine; exclaims, ‘How I like it!’ Mothers, they say, by his\r\n      order, have to stand by while the Guillotine devours their\r\n      children: a band of music is stationed near; and, at the fall of\r\n      every head, strikes up its _ça-ira_.[710] In the Burgh of\r\n      Bedouin, in the Orange region, the Liberty-tree has been cut down\r\n      over night. Representative Maignet, at Orange, hears of it; burns\r\n      Bedouin Burgh to the last dog-hutch; guillotines the inhabitants,\r\n      or drives them into the caves and hills.[711] Republic One and\r\n      Indivisible! She is the newest Birth of Nature’s waste inorganic\r\n      Deep, which men name Orcus, Chaos, primeval Night; and knows one\r\n      law, that of self-preservation. _Tigresse Nationale:_ meddle not\r\n      with a whisker of her! Swift-crushing is her stroke; look what a\r\n      paw she spreads;—pity has not entered her heart.\r\n\r\n      Prudhomme, the dull-blustering Printer and Able Editor, as yet a\r\n      Jacobin Editor, will become a renegade one, and publish large\r\n      volumes on these matters, _Crimes of the Revolution;_ adding\r\n      innumerable lies withal, as if the truth were not sufficient. We,\r\n      for our part, find it more edifying to know, one good time, that\r\n      this Republic and National Tigress _is_ a New Birth; a Fact of\r\n      Nature among Formulas, in an Age of Formulas; and to look,\r\n      oftenest in silence, how the so genuine Nature-Fact will demean\r\n      itself among these. For the Formulas are partly genuine, partly\r\n      delusive, supposititious: we call them, in the language of\r\n      metaphor, regulated modelled _shapes;_ some of which have bodies\r\n      and life still in them; most of which, according to a German\r\n      Writer, have only emptiness, “glass-eyes glaring on you with a\r\n      ghastly affectation of life, and in their interior unclean\r\n      accumulation of beetles and spiders!” But the Fact, let all men\r\n      observe, is a genuine and sincere one; the sincerest of Facts:\r\n      terrible in its sincerity, as very Death. Whatsoever is equally\r\n      sincere may front it, and beard it; but whatsoever is _not?_—\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.IV.\r\n      Carmagnole complete.\r\n\r\n      Simultaneously with this Tophet-black aspect, there unfolds\r\n      itself another aspect, which one may call a Tophet-red aspect:\r\n      the Destruction of the Catholic Religion; and indeed, for the\r\n      time being of Religion itself. We saw Romme’s New Calendar\r\n      establish its _Tenth_ Day of Rest; and asked, what would become\r\n      of the Christian Sabbath? The Calendar is hardly a month old,\r\n      till all this is set at rest. Very singular, as Mercier observes:\r\n      last _Corpus-Christi_ Day 1792, the whole world, and Sovereign\r\n      Authority itself, walked in religious gala, with a quite devout\r\n      air;—Butcher Legendre, supposed to be irreverent, was like to be\r\n      massacred in his Gig, as the thing went by. A Gallican Hierarchy,\r\n      and Church, and Church Formulas seemed to flourish, a little\r\n      brown-leaved or so, but not browner than of late years or\r\n      decades; to flourish, far and wide, in the sympathies of an\r\n      unsophisticated People; defying Philosophism, Legislature and the\r\n      Encyclopédie. Far and wide, alas, like a brown-leaved\r\n      Vallombrosa; which waits but one whirlblast of the November wind,\r\n      and in an hour stands bare! Since that _Corpus-Christi_ Day,\r\n      Brunswick has come, and the Emigrants, and La Vendée, and\r\n      eighteen months of Time: to all flourishing, especially to\r\n      brown-leaved flourishing, there comes, were it never so slowly,\r\n      an end.\r\n\r\n      On the 7th of November, a certain Citoyen Parens, Curate of\r\n      Boissise-le-Bertrand, writes to the Convention that he has all\r\n      his life been preaching a lie, and is grown weary of doing it;\r\n      wherefore he will now lay down his Curacy and stipend, and begs\r\n      that an august Convention would give him something else to live\r\n      upon. “_Mention honorable_,” shall we give him? Or “reference to\r\n      Committee of Finances?” Hardly is this got decided, when goose\r\n      Gobel, Constitutional Bishop of Paris, with his Chapter, with\r\n      Municipal and Departmental escort in red nightcaps, makes his\r\n      appearance, to do as Parens has done. Goose Gobel will now\r\n      acknowledge “no Religion but Liberty;” therefore he doffs his\r\n      Priest-gear, and receives the Fraternal embrace. To the joy of\r\n      Departmental Momoro, of Municipal Chaumettes and Héberts, of\r\n      Vincent and the Revolutionary Army! Chaumette asks, Ought there\r\n      not, in these circumstances, to be among our intercalary Days\r\n      Sans-breeches, a Feast of Reason?[712] Proper surely! Let Atheist\r\n      Maréchal, Lalande, and little Atheist Naigeon rejoice; let\r\n      Clootz, Speaker of Mankind, present to the Convention his\r\n      _Evidences of the Mahometan Religion_, “a work evincing the\r\n      nullity of all Religions,”—with thanks. There shall be Universal\r\n      Republic now, thinks Clootz; and “one God only, _Le Peuple_.”\r\n\r\n      The French Nation is of gregarious imitative nature; it needed\r\n      but a fugle-motion in this matter; and goose Gobel, driven by\r\n      Municipality and force of circumstances, has given one. What Curé\r\n      will be behind him of Boissise; what Bishop behind him of Paris?\r\n      Bishop Grégoire, indeed, courageously declines; to the sound of\r\n      ‘We force no one; let Grégoire consult his conscience;’ but\r\n      Protestant and Romish by the hundred volunteer and assent. From\r\n      far and near, all through November into December, till the work\r\n      is accomplished, come Letters of renegation, come Curates who are\r\n      “learning to be Carpenters,” Curates with their new-wedded Nuns:\r\n      has not the Day of Reason dawned, very swiftly, and become noon?\r\n      From sequestered Townships comes Addresses, stating plainly,\r\n      though in Patois dialect, That “they will have no more to do with\r\n      the black animal called Curay, _animal noir, appellé\r\n      Curay_.”[713]\r\n\r\n      Above all things there come Patriotic Gifts, of Church-furniture.\r\n      The remnant of bells, except for tocsin, descend from their\r\n      belfries, into the National meltingpot, to make cannon. Censers\r\n      and all sacred vessels are beaten broad; of silver, they are fit\r\n      for the poverty-stricken Mint; of pewter, let them become bullets\r\n      to shoot the “enemies of _du genre humain_.” Dalmatics of plush\r\n      make breeches for him who has none; linen stoles will clip into\r\n      shirts for the Defenders of the Country: old-clothesmen, Jew or\r\n      Heathen, drive the briskest trade. Chalier’s Ass Procession, at\r\n      Lyons, was but a type of what went on, in those same days, in all\r\n      Towns. In all Towns and Townships as quick as the guillotine may\r\n      go, so quick goes the axe and the wrench: sacristies, lutrins,\r\n      altar-rails are pulled down; the Mass Books torn into cartridge\r\n      papers: men dance the Carmagnole all night about the bonfire. All\r\n      highways jingle with metallic Priest-tackle, beaten broad; sent\r\n      to the Convention, to the poverty-stricken Mint. Good Sainte\r\n      Geneviève’s _Chasse_ is let down: alas, to be burst open, this\r\n      time, and burnt on the Place de Grève. Saint Louis’s shirt is\r\n      burnt;—might not a Defender of the Country have had it? At\r\n      Saint-Denis Town, no longer Saint-Denis but _Franciade_,\r\n      Patriotism has been down among the Tombs, rummaging; the\r\n      Revolutionary Army has taken spoil. This, accordingly, is what\r\n      the streets of Paris saw:\r\n\r\n      “Most of these persons were still drunk, with the brandy they had\r\n      swallowed out of chalices;—eating mackerel on the patenas!\r\n      Mounted on Asses, which were housed with Priests’ cloaks, they\r\n      reined them with Priests’ stoles: they held clutched with the\r\n      same hand communion-cup and sacred wafer. They stopped at the\r\n      doors of Dramshops; held out ciboriums: and the landlord, stoop\r\n      in hand, had to fill them thrice. Next came Mules high-laden with\r\n      crosses, chandeliers, censers, holy-water vessels,\r\n      hyssops;—recalling to mind the Priests of Cybele, whose panniers,\r\n      filled with the instruments of their worship, served at once as\r\n      storehouse, sacristy and temple. In such equipage did these\r\n      profaners advance towards the Convention. They enter there, in an\r\n      immense train, ranged in two rows; all masked like mummers in\r\n      fantastic sacerdotal vestments; bearing on hand-barrows their\r\n      heaped plunder,—ciboriums, suns, candelabras, plates of gold and\r\n      silver.”[714]\r\n\r\n      The Address we do not give; for indeed it was in strophes, sung\r\n      _vivâ voce_, with all the parts;—Danton glooming considerably, in\r\n      his place; and demanding that there be prose and decency in\r\n      future.[715] Nevertheless the captors of such _spolia opima_\r\n      crave, not untouched with liquor, permission to dance the\r\n      Carmagnole also on the spot: whereto an exhilarated Convention\r\n      cannot but accede. Nay, “several Members,” continues the\r\n      exaggerative Mercier, who was not there to witness, being in\r\n      Limbo now, as one of Duperret’s _Seventy-three_, “several\r\n      Members, quitting their curule chairs, took the hand of girls\r\n      flaunting in Priest’s vestures, and danced the Carmagnole along\r\n      with them.” Such Old-Hallow-tide have they, in this year, once\r\n      named of Grace, 1793.\r\n\r\n      Out of which strange fall of Formulas, tumbling there in confused\r\n      welter, betrampled by the Patriotic dance, is it not passing\r\n      strange to see a _new_ Formula arise? For the human tongue is not\r\n      adequate to speak what “triviality run distracted” there is in\r\n      human nature. Black Mumbo-Jumbo of the woods, and most Indian\r\n      Wau-waus, one can understand: but this of Procureur _Anaxagoras_\r\n      whilom John-Peter Chaumette? We will say only: Man is a born\r\n      idol-worshipper, _sight_-worshipper, so sensuous-imaginative is\r\n      he; and also partakes much of the nature of the ape.\r\n\r\n      For the same day, while this brave Carmagnole dance has hardly\r\n      jigged itself out, there arrive Procureur Chaumette and\r\n      Municipals and Departmentals, and with them the strangest\r\n      freightage: a New Religion! Demoiselle Candeille, of the Opera; a\r\n      woman fair to look upon, when well rouged: she, borne on\r\n      palanquin shoulder-high; with red woolen nightcap; in azure\r\n      mantle; garlanded with oak; holding in her hand the Pike of the\r\n      Jupiter-_Peuple_, sails in; heralded by white young women girt in\r\n      tricolor. Let the world consider it! This, O National Convention\r\n      wonder of the universe, is our New Divinity; _Goddess of Reason_,\r\n      worthy, and alone worthy of revering. Nay, were it too much to\r\n      ask of an august National Representation that it also went with\r\n      us to the _ci-devant_ Cathedral called of Notre-Dame, and\r\n      executed a few strophes in worship of her?\r\n\r\n      President and Secretaries give Goddess Candeille, borne at due\r\n      height round their platform, successively the fraternal kiss;\r\n      whereupon she, by decree, sails to the right-hand of the\r\n      President and there alights. And now, after due pause and\r\n      flourishes of oratory, the Convention, gathering its limbs, does\r\n      get under way in the required procession towards\r\n      Notre-Dame;—Reason, again in her litter, sitting in the van of\r\n      them, borne, as one judges, by men in the Roman costume; escorted\r\n      by wind-music, red nightcaps, and the madness of the world. And\r\n      so straightway, Reason taking seat on the high-altar of\r\n      Notre-Dame, the requisite worship or quasi-worship is, say the\r\n      Newspapers, _executed;_ National Convention chanting “the _Hymn\r\n      to Liberty_, words by Chénier, music by Gossec.” It is the first\r\n      of the _Feasts of Reason;_ first communion-service of the New\r\n      Religion of Chaumette.\r\n\r\n      “The corresponding Festival in the Church of Saint-Eustache,”\r\n      says Mercier, “offered the spectacle of a great tavern. The\r\n      interior of the choir represented a landscape decorated with\r\n      cottages and boskets of trees. Round the choir stood tables\r\n      over-loaded with bottles, with sausages, pork-puddings, pastries\r\n      and other meats. The guests flowed in and out through all doors:\r\n      whosoever presented himself took part of the good things:\r\n      children of eight, girls as well as boys, put hand to plate, in\r\n      sign of Liberty; they drank also of the bottles, and their prompt\r\n      intoxication created laughter. Reason sat in azure mantle aloft,\r\n      in a serene manner; Cannoneers, pipe in mouth, serving her as\r\n      acolytes. And out of doors,” continues the exaggerative man,\r\n      “were mad multitudes dancing round the bonfire of\r\n      Chapel-balustrades, of Priests’ and Canons’ stalls; and the\r\n      dancers, I exaggerate nothing, the dancers nigh bare of breeches,\r\n      neck and breast naked, stockings down, went whirling and\r\n      spinning, like those Dust-vortexes, forerunners of Tempest and\r\n      Destruction.”[716] At Saint-Gervais Church again there was a\r\n      terrible “smell of herrings;” Section or Municipality having\r\n      provided no food, no condiment, but left it to chance. Other\r\n      mysteries, seemingly of a Cabiric or even Paphian character, we\r\n      heave under the Veil, which appropriately stretches itself “along\r\n      the pillars of the aisles,”—not to be lifted aside by the hand of\r\n      History.\r\n\r\n      But there is one thing we should like almost better to understand\r\n      than any other: what Reason herself thought of it, all the while.\r\n      What articulate words poor Mrs. Momoro, for example, uttered;\r\n      when she had become ungoddessed again, and the Bibliopolist and\r\n      she sat quiet at home, at supper? For he was an earnest man,\r\n      Bookseller Momoro; and had notions of Agrarian Law. Mrs. Momoro,\r\n      it is admitted, made one of the best Goddesses of Reason; though\r\n      her teeth were a little defective. And now if the reader will\r\n      represent to himself that such visible Adoration of Reason went\r\n      on “all over the Republic,” through these November and December\r\n      weeks, till the Church woodwork was burnt out, and the business\r\n      otherwise completed, he will feel sufficiently what an adoring\r\n      Republic it was, and without reluctance quit this part of the\r\n      subject.\r\n\r\n      Such gifts of Church-spoil are chiefly the work of the _Armée\r\n      Révolutionnaire;_ raised, as we said, some time ago. It is an\r\n      Army with portable guillotine: commanded by Playwright Ronsin in\r\n      terrible moustachioes; and even by some uncertain shadow of Usher\r\n      Maillard, the old Bastille Hero, Leader of the Menads, September\r\n      Man in Grey! Clerk Vincent of the War-Office, one of Pache’s old\r\n      Clerks, “with a head heated by the ancient orators,” had a main\r\n      hand in the appointments, at least in the staff-appointments.\r\n\r\n      But of the marchings and retreatings of these Six Thousand no\r\n      Xenophon exists. Nothing, but an inarticulate hum, of cursing and\r\n      sooty frenzy, surviving dubious in the memory of ages! They scour\r\n      the country round Paris; seeking Prisoners; raising Requisitions;\r\n      seeing that Edicts are executed, that the Farmers have thrashed\r\n      sufficiently; lowering Church-bells or metallic Virgins.\r\n      Detachments shoot forth dim, towards remote parts of France; nay\r\n      new Provincial Revolutionary Armies rise dim, here and there, as\r\n      Carrier’s Company of Marat, as Tallien’s Bourdeaux Troop; like\r\n      sympathetic clouds in an atmosphere all electric. Ronsin, they\r\n      say, admitted, in candid moments, that his troops were the elixir\r\n      of the Rascality of the Earth. One sees them drawn up in\r\n      market-places; travel-plashed, rough-bearded, in _carmagnole\r\n      complète:_ the first exploit is to prostrate what Royal or\r\n      Ecclesiastical monument, crucifix or the like, there may be; to\r\n      plant a cannon at the steeple, fetch down the bell without\r\n      climbing for it, bell and belfry together. This, however, it is\r\n      said, depends somewhat on the size of the town: if the town\r\n      contains much population, and these perhaps of a dubious choleric\r\n      aspect, the Revolutionary Army will do its work gently, by ladder\r\n      and wrench; nay perhaps will take its billet without work at all;\r\n      and, refreshing itself with a little liquor and sleep, pass on to\r\n      the next stage.[717] Pipe in cheek, sabre on thigh; in carmagnole\r\n      complete!\r\n\r\n      Such things have been; and may again be. Charles Second sent out\r\n      his Highland Host over the Western Scotch Whigs; Jamaica Planters\r\n      got Dogs from the Spanish Main to hunt their Maroons with: France\r\n      too is bescoured with a Devil’s Pack, the baying of which, at\r\n      this distance of half a century, still sounds in the mind’s ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.V.\r\n      Like a Thunder-Cloud.\r\n\r\n      But the grand, and indeed substantially primary and generic\r\n      aspect of the Consummation of Terror remains still to be looked\r\n      at; nay blinkard History has for most part all but _over_looked\r\n      this aspect, the soul of the whole: that which makes it terrible\r\n      to the Enemies of France. Let Despotism and Cimmerian Coalitions\r\n      consider. All French men and French things are in a State of\r\n      Requisition; Fourteen Armies are got on foot; Patriotism, with\r\n      all that it has of faculty in heart or in head, in soul or body\r\n      or breeches-pocket, is rushing to the frontiers, to prevail or\r\n      die! Busy sits Carnot, in _Salut Public;_ busy for his share, in\r\n      “organising victory.” Not swifter pulses that Guillotine, in\r\n      dread systole-diastole in the Place de la Révolution, than smites\r\n      the Sword of Patriotism, smiting Cimmeria back to its own\r\n      borders, from the sacred soil.\r\n\r\n      In fact the Government is what we can call Revolutionary; and\r\n      some men are “_à la hauteur_,” on a level with the circumstances;\r\n      and others are not _à la hauteur_,—so much the worse for them.\r\n      But the Anarchy, we may say, has _organised_ itself: Society is\r\n      literally overset; its old forces working with mad activity, but\r\n      in the inverse order; destructive and self-destructive.\r\n\r\n      Curious to see how all still refers itself to some head and\r\n      fountain; not even an Anarchy but must have a centre to revolve\r\n      round. It is now some six months since the Committee of _Salut\r\n      Public_ came into existence: some three months since Danton\r\n      proposed that all power should be given it and “a sum of fifty\r\n      millions,” and the “Government be declared Revolutionary.” He\r\n      himself, since that day, would take no hand in it, though again\r\n      and again solicited; but sits private in his place on the\r\n      Mountain. Since that day, the Nine, or if they should even rise\r\n      to Twelve have become permanent, always re-elected when their\r\n      term runs out; _Salut Public, Sûreté Générale_ have assumed their\r\n      ulterior form and mode of operating.\r\n\r\n      Committee of Public Salvation, as supreme; of General Surety, as\r\n      subaltern: these like a Lesser and Greater Council, most\r\n      harmonious hitherto, have become the centre of all things. They\r\n      ride this Whirlwind; they, raised by force of circumstances,\r\n      insensibly, very strangely, thither to that dread height;—and\r\n      guide it, and seem to guide it. Stranger set of Cloud-Compellers\r\n      the Earth never saw. A Robespierre, a Billaud, a Collot, Couthon,\r\n      Saint-Just; not to mention still meaner Amars, Vadiers, in\r\n      _Sûreté Générale:_ these are your Cloud-Compellers. Small\r\n      intellectual talent is necessary: indeed where among them, except\r\n      in the head of Carnot, busied organising victory, would you find\r\n      any? The talent is one of instinct rather. It is that of divining\r\n      aright what this great dumb Whirlwind wishes and wills; that of\r\n      willing, with more frenzy than any one, what all the world wills.\r\n      To stand at no obstacles; to heed no considerations human or\r\n      divine; to know well that, of divine or human, there is one thing\r\n      needful, Triumph of the Republic, Destruction of the Enemies of\r\n      the Republic! With this one spiritual endowment, and so few\r\n      others, it is strange to see how a dumb inarticulately storming\r\n      Whirlwind of things puts, as it were, its reins into your hand,\r\n      and invites and compels you to be leader of it.\r\n\r\n      Hard by, sits a Municipality of Paris; all in red nightcaps since\r\n      the fourth of November last: a set of men fully “on a level with\r\n      circumstances,” or even beyond it. Sleek Mayor Pache, studious to\r\n      be safe in the middle; Chaumettes, Héberts, Varlets, and Henriot\r\n      their great Commandant; not to speak of Vincent the War-clerk, of\r\n      Momoros, Dobsents, and such like: all intent to have Churches\r\n      plundered, to have Reason adored, Suspects cut down, and the\r\n      Revolution triumph. Perhaps carrying the matter _too_ far? Danton\r\n      was heard to grumble at the civic strophes; and to recommend\r\n      prose and decency. Robespierre also grumbles that in overturning\r\n      Superstition we did not mean to make a religion of Atheism. In\r\n      fact, your Chaumette and Company constitute a kind of\r\n      Hyper-Jacobinism, or rabid “Faction _des Enragés;_” which has\r\n      given orthodox Patriotism some umbrage, of late months. To “know\r\n      a Suspect on the streets:” what is this but bringing the _Law of\r\n      the Suspect_ itself into ill odour? Men half-frantic, men zealous\r\n      overmuch,—they toil there, in their red nightcaps, restlessly,\r\n      rapidly, accomplishing what of Life is allotted them.\r\n\r\n      And the Forty-four Thousand other Townships, each with\r\n      revolutionary Committee, based on Jacobin Daughter Society;\r\n      enlightened by the spirit of Jacobinism; quickened by the Forty\r\n      Sous a-day!—The French Constitution spurned always at any thing\r\n      like Two Chambers; and yet behold, has it not verily got Two\r\n      Chambers? National Convention, elected for one; Mother of\r\n      Patriotism, self-elected, for another! Mother of Patriotism has\r\n      her Debates reported in the _Moniteur_, as important\r\n      state-procedures; which indisputably they are. A Second Chamber\r\n      of Legislature we call this Mother Society;—if perhaps it were\r\n      not rather comparable to that old Scotch Body named _Lords of the\r\n      Articles_, without whose origination, and signal given, the\r\n      so-called Parliament could introduce no bill, could do no work?\r\n      Robespierre himself, whose words are a law, opens his\r\n      incorruptible lips copiously in the Jacobins Hall. Smaller\r\n      Council of _Salut Public_, Greater Council of _Sûreté Générale_,\r\n      all active Parties, come here to plead; to shape beforehand what\r\n      decision they must arrive at, what destiny they have to expect.\r\n      Now if a question arose, Which of those Two Chambers, Convention,\r\n      or Lords of the Articles, was the _stronger?_ Happily they as yet\r\n      go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n      As for the National Convention, truly it has become a most\r\n      composed Body. Quenched now the old effervescence; the\r\n      Seventy-three locked in ward; once noisy Friends of the Girondins\r\n      sunk all into silent men of the Plain, called even “Frogs of the\r\n      Marsh,” _Crapauds du Marais!_ Addresses come, Revolutionary\r\n      Church-plunder comes; Deputations, with prose, or strophes: these\r\n      the Convention receives. But beyond this, the Convention has one\r\n      thing mainly to do: to listen what _Salut Public_ proposes, and\r\n      say, Yea.\r\n\r\n      Bazire followed by Chabot, with some impetuosity, declared, one\r\n      morning, that this was not the way of a Free Assembly. ‘There\r\n      ought to be an Opposition side, a _Côté Droit_,’ cried Chabot;\r\n      ‘if none else will form it, I will: people say to me, You will\r\n      all get guillotined in your turn, first you and Bazire, then\r\n      Danton, then Robespierre himself.’[718] So spake the Disfrocked,\r\n      with a loud voice: next week, Bazire and he lie in the Abbaye;\r\n      wending, one may fear, towards Tinville and the Axe; and “people\r\n      say to me”—what seems to be proving true! Bazire’s blood was all\r\n      inflamed with Revolution fever; with coffee and spasmodic\r\n      dreams.[719] Chabot, again, how happy with his rich Jew-Austrian\r\n      wife, late Fraulein Frey! But he lies in Prison; and his two\r\n      Jew-Austrian Brothers-in-Law, the Bankers Frey, lie with him;\r\n      waiting the urn of doom. Let a National Convention, therefore,\r\n      take warning, and know its function. Let the Convention, all as\r\n      one man, set its shoulder to the work; not with bursts of\r\n      Parliamentary eloquence, but in quite other and serviceable ways!\r\n\r\n      Convention Commissioners, what we ought to call Representatives,\r\n      “_Représentans_ on mission,” fly, like the Herald Mercury, to all\r\n      points of the Territory; carrying your behests far and wide. In\r\n      their “round hat plumed with tricolor feathers, girt with flowing\r\n      tricolor taffeta; in close frock, tricolor sash, sword and\r\n      jack-boots,” these men are powerfuller than King or Kaiser. They\r\n      say to whomso they meet, Do; and he must do it: all men’s goods\r\n      are at their disposal; for France is as one huge City in Siege.\r\n      They smite with Requisitions, and Forced-loan; they have the\r\n      power of life and death. Saint-Just and Lebas order the rich\r\n      classes of Strasburg to “strip off their shoes,” and send them to\r\n      the Armies where as many as “ten thousand pairs” are needed.\r\n      Also, that within four and twenty hours, “a thousand beds” are to\r\n      be got ready;[720] wrapt in matting, and sent under way. For the\r\n      time presses!—Like swift bolts, issuing from the fuliginous\r\n      Olympus of _Salut Public_ rush these men, oftenest in pairs;\r\n      scatter your thunder-orders over France; make France one enormous\r\n      Revolutionary thunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.VI.\r\n      Do thy Duty.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly alongside of these bonfires of Church balustrades,\r\n      and sounds of fusillading and noyading, there rise quite another\r\n      sort of fires and sounds: Smithy-fires and Proof-volleys for the\r\n      manufacture of arms.\r\n\r\n      Cut off from Sweden and the world, the Republic must learn to\r\n      make steel for itself; and, by aid of Chemists, she has learnt\r\n      it. Towns that knew only iron, now know steel: from their new\r\n      dungeons at Chantilly, Aristocrats may hear the rustle of our new\r\n      steel furnace there. Do not bells transmute themselves into\r\n      cannon; iron stancheons into the white-weapon (_arme blanche_),\r\n      by sword-cutlery? The wheels of Langres scream, amid their\r\n      sputtering fire halo; grinding mere swords. The stithies of\r\n      Charleville ring with gun-making. What say we, Charleville? Two\r\n      hundred and fifty-eight Forges stand in the open spaces of Paris\r\n      itself; a hundred and forty of them in the Esplanade of the\r\n      Invalides, fifty-four in the Luxembourg Garden: so many Forges\r\n      stand; grim Smiths beating and forging at lock and barrel there.\r\n      The Clockmakers have come, requisitioned, to do the touch-holes,\r\n      the hard-solder and filework. Five great Barges swing at anchor\r\n      on the Seine Stream, loud with boring; the great press-drills\r\n      grating harsh thunder to the general ear and heart. And deft\r\n      Stock-makers do gouge and rasp; and all men bestir themselves,\r\n      according to their cunning:—in the language of hope, it is\r\n      reckoned that a “thousand finished muskets can be delivered\r\n      daily.”[721] Chemists of the Republic have taught us miracles of\r\n      swift tanning;[722] the cordwainer bores and stitches;—_not_ of\r\n      “wood and pasteboard,” or he shall answer it to Tinville! The\r\n      women sew tents and coats, the children scrape surgeon’s-lint,\r\n      the old men sit in the market-places; able men are on march; all\r\n      men in requisition: from Town to Town flutters, on the Heaven’s\r\n      winds, this Banner, THE FRENCH PEOPLE RISEN AGAINST TYRANTS.\r\n\r\n      All which is well. But now arises the question: What is to be\r\n      done for saltpetre? Interrupted Commerce and the English Navy\r\n      shut us out from saltpetre; and without saltpetre there is no\r\n      gunpowder. Republican Science again sits meditative; discovers\r\n      that saltpetre exists here and there, though in attenuated\r\n      quantity: that old plaster of walls holds a sprinkling of\r\n      it;—that the earth of the Paris Cellars holds a sprinkling of it,\r\n      diffused through the common rubbish; that were these dug up and\r\n      washed, saltpetre might be had. Whereupon swiftly, see! the\r\n      Citoyens, with upshoved _bonnet rouge_, or with doffed bonnet,\r\n      and hair toil-wetted; digging fiercely, each in his own cellar,\r\n      for saltpetre. The Earth-heap rises at every door; the Citoyennes\r\n      with hod and bucket carrying it up; the Citoyens, pith in every\r\n      muscle, shovelling and digging: for life and saltpetre. Dig my\r\n      _braves;_ and right well speed ye. What of saltpetre is essential\r\n      the Republic shall not want.\r\n\r\n      Consummation of Sansculottism has many aspects and tints: but the\r\n      brightest tint, really of a solar or stellar brightness, is this\r\n      which the Armies give it. That same fervour of Jacobinism which\r\n      internally fills France with hatred, suspicions, scaffolds and\r\n      Reason-worship, does, on the Frontiers, shew itself as a glorious\r\n      _Pro patria mori_. Ever since Dumouriez’s defection, three\r\n      Convention Representatives attend every General. Committee of\r\n      _Salut_ has sent them, often with this Laconic order only: ‘Do\r\n      thy duty, _Fais ton devoir_.’ It is strange, under what\r\n      impediments the fire of Jacobinism, like other such fires, will\r\n      burn. These Soldiers have shoes of wood and pasteboard, or go\r\n      booted in hayropes, in dead of winter; they skewer a bass mat\r\n      round their shoulders, and are destitute of most things. What\r\n      then? It is for Rights of Frenchhood, of Manhood, that they\r\n      fight: the unquenchable spirit, here as elsewhere, works\r\n      miracles. ‘With steel and bread,’ says the Convention\r\n      Representative, ‘one may get to China.’ The Generals go fast to\r\n      the guillotine; justly and unjustly. From which what inference?\r\n      This among others: That ill-success is death; that in victory\r\n      alone is life! To conquer or die is no theatrical palabra, in\r\n      these circumstances: but a practical truth and necessity. All\r\n      Girondism, Halfness, Compromise is swept away. Forward, ye\r\n      Soldiers of the Republic, captain and man! Dash with your Gaelic\r\n      impetuosity, on Austria, England, Prussia, Spain, Sardinia; Pitt,\r\n      Cobourg, York, and the Devil and the World! Behind us is but the\r\n      Guillotine; before us is Victory, Apotheosis and Millennium\r\n      without end!\r\n\r\n      See accordingly, on all Frontiers, how the Sons of Night,\r\n      astonished after short triumph, do recoil;—the Sons of the\r\n      Republic flying at them, with wild _Ça-ira_ or Marseillese _Aux\r\n      armes_, with the temper of cat-o’-mountain, or demon incarnate;\r\n      which no Son of Night can stand! Spain, which came bursting\r\n      through the Pyrenees, rustling with Bourbon banners, and went\r\n      conquering here and there for a season, falters at such\r\n      cat-o’-mountain welcome; draws itself in again; too happy now\r\n      were the Pyrenees impassable. Not only does Dugommier, conqueror\r\n      of Toulon, drive Spain back; he invades Spain. General Dugommier\r\n      invades it by the Eastern Pyrenees; General Muller shall invade\r\n      it by the Western. _Shall_, that is the word: Committee of _Salut\r\n      Public_ has said it; Representative Cavaignac, on mission there,\r\n      must see it done. Impossible! cries Muller,—Infallible! answers\r\n      Cavaignac. Difficulty, impossibility, is to no purpose. ‘The\r\n      Committee is deaf on that side of its head,’ answers Cavaignac,\r\n      ‘_n’entend pas de cette oreille là_. How many wantest thou, of\r\n      men, of horses, cannons? Thou shalt have them. Conquerors,\r\n      conquered or hanged, forward we must.’[723] Which things also,\r\n      even as the Representative spake them, were _done_. The Spring of\r\n      the new Year sees Spain invaded: and redoubts are carried, and\r\n      Passes and Heights of the most scarped description; Spanish\r\n      Field-officerism struck mute at such cat-o’-mountain spirit, the\r\n      cannon forgetting to fire.[724] Swept are the Pyrenees; Town\r\n      after Town flies up, burst by terror or the petard. In the course\r\n      of another year, Spain will crave Peace; acknowledge its sins and\r\n      the Republic; nay, in Madrid, there will be joy as for a victory,\r\n      that even Peace is got.\r\n\r\n      Few things, we repeat, can be notabler than these Convention\r\n      Representatives, with their power more than kingly. Nay at bottom\r\n      are they not Kings, _Able-men_, of a sort; chosen from the Seven\r\n      Hundred and Forty-nine French Kings; with this order, Do thy\r\n      duty? Representative Levasseur, of small stature, by trade a mere\r\n      pacific Surgeon-Accoucheur, has mutinies to quell; mad hosts (mad\r\n      at the Doom of Custine) bellowing far and wide; he alone amid\r\n      them, the one small Representative,—small, but as hard as flint,\r\n      which also carries _fire_ in it! So too, at Hondschooten, far in\r\n      the afternoon, he declares that the battle is not lost; that it\r\n      must be gained; and fights, himself, with his own obstetric\r\n      hand;—horse shot under him, or say on foot, “up to the haunches\r\n      in tide-water;” cutting stoccado and passado there, in defiance\r\n      of Water, Earth, Air and Fire, the choleric little Representative\r\n      that he was! Whereby, as natural, Royal Highness of York had to\r\n      withdraw,—occasionally at full gallop; like to be swallowed by\r\n      the tide: and his Siege of Dunkirk became a dream, realising only\r\n      much loss of beautiful siege-artillery and of brave lives.[725]\r\n\r\n      General Houchard, it would appear, stood behind a hedge, on this\r\n      Hondschooten occasion; wherefore they have since guillotined him.\r\n      A new General Jourdan, late Serjeant Jourdan, commands in his\r\n      stead: he, in long-winded Battles of Watigny, “murderous\r\n      artillery-fire mingling itself with sound of Revolutionary\r\n      battle-hymns,” forces Austria behind the Sambre again; has hopes\r\n      of purging the soil of Liberty. With hard wrestling, with\r\n      artillerying and _ça-ira_-ing, it shall be done. In the course of\r\n      a new Summer, Valenciennes will see itself beleaguered; Condé\r\n      beleaguered; whatsoever is yet in the hands of Austria\r\n      beleaguered and bombarded: nay, by Convention Decree, we even\r\n      summon them _all_ “either to surrender in twenty-four hours, or\r\n      else be put to the sword;”—a high saying, which, though it\r\n      remains unfulfilled, may shew what spirit one is of.\r\n\r\n      Representative Drouet, as an Old-Dragoon, could fight by a kind\r\n      of second nature; but he was unlucky. Him, in a night-foray at\r\n      Maubeuge, the Austrians took alive, in October last. They stript\r\n      him almost naked, he says; making a shew of him, as King-taker of\r\n      Varennes. They flung him into carts; sent him far into the\r\n      interior of Cimmeria, to “a Fortress called Spitzberg” on the\r\n      Danube River; and left him there, at an elevation of perhaps a\r\n      hundred and fifty feet, to his own bitter reflections.\r\n      Reflections; and also devices! For the indomitable Old-dragoon\r\n      constructs wing-machinery, of Paperkite; saws window-bars:\r\n      determines to fly down. He will seize a boat, will follow the\r\n      River’s course: land somewhere in Crim Tartary, in the Black Sea\r\n      or Constantinople region: _à la_ Sindbad! Authentic History,\r\n      accordingly, looking far into Cimmeria, discerns dimly a\r\n      phenomenon. In the dead night-watches, the Spitzberg sentry is\r\n      near fainting with terror: Is it a huge vague Portent descending\r\n      through the night air? It is a huge National Representative\r\n      Old-dragoon, descending by Paperkite; too rapidly, alas! For\r\n      Drouet had taken with him “a small provision-store, twenty pounds\r\n      weight or thereby;” which proved accelerative: so he fell,\r\n      fracturing his leg; and lay there, moaning, till day dawned, till\r\n      you could discern clearly that he was not a Portent but a\r\n      Representative![726]\r\n\r\n      Or see Saint-Just, in the Lines of Weissembourg, though\r\n      physically of a timid apprehensive nature, how he charges with\r\n      his “Alsatian Peasants armed hastily” for the nonce; the solemn\r\n      face of him blazing into flame; his black hair and tricolor\r\n      hat-taffeta flowing in the breeze; These our Lines of\r\n      Weissembourg were indeed forced, and Prussia and the Emigrants\r\n      rolled through: but we _re_-force the Lines of Weissembourg; and\r\n      Prussia and the Emigrants roll back again still faster,—hurled\r\n      with bayonet charges and fiery _ça-ira_-ing.\r\n\r\n      _Ci-devant_ Sergeant Pichegru, _ci-devant_ Sergeant Hoche, risen\r\n      now to be Generals, have done wonders here. Tall Pichegru was\r\n      meant for the Church; was Teacher of Mathematics once, in Brienne\r\n      School,—his remarkablest Pupil there was the Boy Napoleon\r\n      Buonaparte. He then, not in the sweetest humour, enlisted\r\n      exchanging ferula for musket; and had got the length of the\r\n      halberd, beyond which nothing could be hoped; when the Bastille\r\n      barriers falling made passage for him, and he is here. Hoche bore\r\n      a hand at the literal overturn of the Bastille; he was, as we\r\n      saw, a Serjeant of the _Gardes Françaises_, spending his pay in\r\n      rushlights and cheap editions of books. How the Mountains are\r\n      burst, and many an Enceladus is disemprisoned: and Captains\r\n      founding on Four parchments of Nobility, are blown with their\r\n      parchments across the Rhine, into Lunar Limbo!\r\n\r\n      What high feats of arms, therefore, were done in these Fourteen\r\n      Armies; and how, for love of Liberty and hope of Promotion,\r\n      low-born valour cut its desperate way to Generalship; and, from\r\n      the central Carnot in _Salut Public_ to the outmost drummer on\r\n      the Frontiers, men strove for their Republic, let readers fancy.\r\n      The snows of Winter, the flowers of Summer continue to be stained\r\n      with warlike blood. Gaelic impetuosity mounts ever higher with\r\n      victory; spirit of Jacobinism weds itself to national vanity: the\r\n      Soldiers of the Republic are becoming, as we prophesied, very\r\n      Sons of Fire. Barefooted, barebacked: but with bread and iron you\r\n      can get to China! It is one Nation against the whole world; but\r\n      the Nation has that within her which the whole world will not\r\n      conquer. Cimmeria, astonished, recoils faster or slower; all\r\n      round the Republic there rises fiery, as it were, a magic ring of\r\n      musket-volleying and _ça-ira_-ing. Majesty of Prussia, as Majesty\r\n      of Spain, will by and by acknowledge his sins and the Republic:\r\n      and make a Peace of Bâle.\r\n\r\n      Foreign Commerce, Colonies, Factories in the East and in the\r\n      West, are fallen or falling into the hands of sea-ruling Pitt,\r\n      enemy of human nature. Nevertheless what sound is this that we\r\n      hear, on the first of June, 1794; sound of as war-thunder borne\r\n      from the Ocean too; of tone most piercing? War-thunder from off\r\n      the Brest waters: Villaret-Joyeuse and English Howe, after long\r\n      manœuvring have ranked themselves there; and are belching fire.\r\n      The enemies of human nature are on their own element; cannot be\r\n      conquered; cannot be kept from conquering. Twelve hours of raging\r\n      cannonade; sun now sinking westward through the battle-smoke: six\r\n      French Ships taken, the Battle lost; what Ship soever can still\r\n      sail, making off! But how is it, then, with that _Vengeur_ Ship,\r\n      she neither strikes nor makes off? She is lamed, she cannot make\r\n      off; strike she will not. Fire rakes her fore and aft, from\r\n      victorious enemies; the _Vengeur_ is sinking. Strong are ye,\r\n      Tyrants of the Sea; yet we also, are we weak? Lo! all flags,\r\n      streamers, jacks, every rag of tricolor that will yet run on\r\n      rope, fly rustling aloft: the whole crew crowds to the upper\r\n      deck; and, with universal soul-maddening yell, shouts _Vive la\r\n      République_,—sinking, sinking. She staggers, she lurches, her\r\n      last drunk whirl; Ocean yawns abysmal: down rushes the _Vengeur_,\r\n      carrying _Vive la République_ along with her, unconquerable, into\r\n      Eternity![727] Let foreign Despots think of that. There is an\r\n      Unconquerable in man, when he stands on his Rights of Man: let\r\n      Despots and Slaves and all people know this, and only them that\r\n      stand on the Wrongs of Man tremble to know it.—So has History\r\n      written, nothing doubting, of the sunk _Vengeur_.\r\n\r\n      —Reader! Mendez Pinto, Münchausen, Cagliostro, Psalmanazar have\r\n      been great; but they are not the greatest. O Barrère, Barrère,\r\n      Anacreon of the Guillotine! must inquisitive pictorial History,\r\n      in a new edition, ask again, “How _is_ it with the _Vengeur_,” in\r\n      this its glorious suicidal sinking; and, with resentful brush,\r\n      dash a bend-sinister of contumelious lamp-black through thee and\r\n      it? Alas, alas! The _Vengeur_, after fighting bravely, did sink\r\n      altogether as other ships do, her captain and above two-hundred\r\n      of her crew escaping gladly in British boats; and this same\r\n      enormous inspiring Feat, and rumour “of sound most piercing,”\r\n      turns out to be an enormous inspiring Non-entity, extant nowhere\r\n      save, as falsehood, in the brain of Barrère! Actually so.[728]\r\n      Founded, like the World itself, on _Nothing;_ proved by\r\n      Convention Report, by solemn Convention Decree and Decrees, and\r\n      wooden “_Model of the Vengeur;_” believed, bewept, besung by the\r\n      whole French People to this hour, it may be regarded as Barrère’s\r\n      masterpiece; the largest, most inspiring piece of _blague_\r\n      manufactured, for some centuries, by any man or nation. As such,\r\n      and not otherwise, be it henceforth memorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.5.VII.\r\n      Flame-Picture.\r\n\r\n      In this manner, mad-blazing with flame of all imaginable tints,\r\n      from the red of Tophet to the stellar-bright, blazes off this\r\n      Consummation of Sansculottism.\r\n\r\n      But the hundredth part of the things that were done, and the\r\n      thousandth part of the things that were projected and decreed to\r\n      be done, would tire the tongue of History. Statue of the _Peuple\r\n      Souverain_, high as Strasburg Steeple; which shall fling its\r\n      shadow from the Pont Neuf over Jardin National and Convention\r\n      Hall;—enormous, in Painter David’s head! With other the like\r\n      enormous Statues not a few: realised in paper Decree. For,\r\n      indeed, the Statue of Liberty herself is still but Plaster in the\r\n      Place de la Révolution! Then Equalisation of Weights and\r\n      Measures, with decimal division; Institutions, of Music and of\r\n      much else; Institute in general; School of Arts, School of Mars,\r\n      _Elèves de la Patrie_, Normal Schools: amid such Gun-boring,\r\n      Altar-burning, Saltpetre-digging, and miraculous improvements in\r\n      Tannery!\r\n\r\n      What, for example, is this that Engineer Chappe is doing, in the\r\n      Park of Vincennes? In the Park of Vincennes; and onwards, they\r\n      say, in the Park of Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau the assassinated\r\n      Deputy; and still onwards to the Heights of Ecouen and further,\r\n      he has scaffolding set up, has posts driven in; wooden arms with\r\n      elbow joints are jerking and fugling in the air, in the most\r\n      rapid mysterious manner! Citoyens ran up suspicious. Yes, O\r\n      Citoyens, we are signaling: it is a device this, worthy of the\r\n      Republic; a thing for what we will call _Far-writing_ without the\r\n      aid of postbags; in Greek, it shall be named\r\n      Telegraph.—_Télégraphe sacré!_ answers Citoyenism: For writing to\r\n      Traitors, to Austria?—and tears it down. Chappe had to escape,\r\n      and get a new Legislative Decree. Nevertheless he has\r\n      accomplished it, the indefatigable Chappe: this his _Far-writer_,\r\n      with its wooden arms and elbow-joints, can intelligibly signal;\r\n      and lines of them are set up, to the North Frontiers and\r\n      elsewhither. On an Autumn evening of the Year Two, Far-writer\r\n      having just written that Condé Town has surrendered to us, we\r\n      send from Tuileries Convention Hall this response in the shape of\r\n      Decree: “The name of Condé is changed to _Nord-Libre_,\r\n      North-Free. The Army of the North ceases not to merit well of the\r\n      country.”—To the admiration of men! For lo, in some half hour,\r\n      while the Convention yet debates, there arrives this new answer:\r\n      “I inform thee, _je t’annonce_, Citizen President, that the\r\n      decree of Convention, ordering change of the name Condé into\r\n      _North-Free;_ and the other declaring that the Army of the North\r\n      ceases not to merit well of the country, are transmitted and\r\n      acknowledged by Telegraph. I have instructed my Officer at Lille\r\n      to forward them to North-Free by express. _Signed_, CHAPPE.”[729]\r\n\r\n      Or see, over Fleurus in the Netherlands, where General Jourdan,\r\n      having now swept the soil of Liberty, and advanced thus far, is\r\n      just about to fight, and sweep or be swept, things there not in\r\n      the Heaven’s Vault, some Prodigy, seen by Austrian eyes and\r\n      spyglasses: in the similitude of an enormous Windbag, with\r\n      netting and enormous Saucer depending from it? A Jove’s Balance,\r\n      O ye Austrian spyglasses? One saucer-hole of a Jove’s Balance;\r\n      _your_ poor Austrian scale having kicked itself quite aloft, out\r\n      of sight? By Heaven, answer the spyglasses, it is a Montgolfier,\r\n      a Balloon, and they are making signals! Austrian cannon-battery\r\n      barks at this Montgolfier; harmless as dog at the Moon: the\r\n      Montgolfier makes its signals; detects what Austrian ambuscade\r\n      there may be, and descends at its ease.[730] What will not these\r\n      devils incarnate contrive?\r\n\r\n      On the whole, is it not, O Reader, one of the strangest\r\n      Flame-Pictures that ever painted itself; flaming off there, on\r\n      its ground of Guillotine-black? And the nightly Theatres are\r\n      Twenty-three; and the _Salons de danse_ are sixty: full of mere\r\n      _Egalité, Fraternite_ and _Carmagnole_. And Section\r\n      Committee-rooms are Forty-eight; redolent of tobacco and brandy:\r\n      vigorous with twenty-pence a-day, coercing the suspect. And the\r\n      Houses of Arrest are Twelve for Paris alone; crowded and even\r\n      crammed. And at all turns, you need your “Certificate of Civism;”\r\n      be it for going out, or for coming in; nay without it you cannot,\r\n      for money, get your daily ounces of bread. Dusky red-capped\r\n      Baker’s-queues; wagging themselves; not in silence! For we still\r\n      live by Maximum, in all things; waited on by these two, Scarcity\r\n      and Confusion. The faces of men are darkened with suspicion; with\r\n      suspecting, or being suspect. The streets lie unswept; the ways\r\n      unmended. Law has shut her Books; speaks little, save impromptu,\r\n      through the throat of Tinville. Crimes go unpunished: not crimes\r\n      against the Revolution.[731] “The number of foundling children,”\r\n      as some compute, “is doubled.”\r\n\r\n      How silent now sits Royalism; sits all Aristocratism;\r\n      Respectability that kept its Gig! The honour now, and the safety,\r\n      is to Poverty, not to Wealth. Your Citizen, who would be\r\n      fashionable, walks abroad, with his Wife on his arm, in red wool\r\n      nightcap, black shag spencer, and carmagnole complete.\r\n      Aristocratism crouches low, in what shelter is still left;\r\n      submitting to all requisitions, vexations; too happy to escape\r\n      with life. Ghastly châteaus stare on you by the wayside;\r\n      disroofed, diswindowed; which the National House-broker is\r\n      peeling for the lead and ashlar. The old tenants hover\r\n      disconsolate, over the Rhine with Condé; a spectacle to men.\r\n      _Ci-devant_ Seigneur, exquisite in palate, will become an\r\n      exquisite Restaurateur Cook in Hamburg; Ci-devant Madame,\r\n      exquisite in dress, a successful _Marchande des Modes_ in London.\r\n      In Newgate-Street, you meet M. le Marquis, with a rough deal on\r\n      his shoulder, adze and jack-plane under arm; he has taken to the\r\n      joiner trade; it being necessary to live (_faut\r\n      vivre_).[732]—Higher than all Frenchmen the domestic Stock-jobber\r\n      flourishes,—in a day of Paper-money. The Farmer also flourishes:\r\n      “Farmers’ houses,” says Mercier, “have become like Pawn-brokers’\r\n      shops;” all manner of furniture, apparel, vessels of gold and\r\n      silver accumulate themselves there: bread is precious. The\r\n      Farmer’s rent is Paper-money, and he alone of men has bread:\r\n      Farmer is better than Landlord, and will himself become Landlord.\r\n\r\n      And daily, we say, like a black Spectre, silently through that\r\n      Life-tumult, passes the Revolution Cart; writing on the walls its\r\n      MENE, MENE, _Thou art weighed, and found wanting!_ A Spectre with\r\n      which one has grown familiar. Men have adjusted themselves:\r\n      complaint issues not from that Death-tumbril. Weak women and\r\n      _ci-devants_, their plumage and finery all tarnished, sit there;\r\n      with a silent gaze, as if looking into the Infinite Black. The\r\n      once light lip wears a curl of irony, uttering no word; and the\r\n      Tumbril fares along. They may be guilty before Heaven, or not;\r\n      they are guilty, we suppose, before the Revolution. Then, does\r\n      not the Republic “coin money” of them, with its great axe? Red\r\n      Nightcaps howl dire approval: the rest of Paris looks on; if with\r\n      a sigh, that is much; Fellow-creatures whom sighing cannot help;\r\n      whom black Necessity and Tinville have clutched.\r\n\r\n      One other thing, or rather two other things, we will still\r\n      mention; and no more: The Blond Perukes; the Tannery at Meudon.\r\n      Great talk is of these _Perruques blondes:_ O Reader, they are\r\n      made from the Heads of Guillotined women! The locks of a Duchess,\r\n      in this way, may come to cover the scalp of a Cordwainer: her\r\n      blond German Frankism his black Gaelic poll, if it be bald. Or\r\n      they may be worn affectionately, as relics; rendering one\r\n      suspect?[733] Citizens use them, not without mockery; of a rather\r\n      cannibal sort.\r\n\r\n      Still deeper into one’s heart goes that Tannery at Meudon; not\r\n      mentioned among the other miracles of tanning! “At Meudon,” says\r\n      Montgaillard with considerable calmness, “there was a Tannery of\r\n      Human Skins; such of the Guillotined as seemed worth flaying: of\r\n      which perfectly good wash-leather was made:” for breeches, and\r\n      other uses. The skin of the men, he remarks, was superior in\r\n      toughness (_consistance_) and quality to shamoy; that of women\r\n      was good for almost nothing, being so soft in\r\n      texture![734]—History looking back over Cannibalism, through\r\n      _Purchas’s Pilgrims_ and all early and late Records, will perhaps\r\n      find no terrestrial Cannibalism of a sort on the whole so\r\n      detestable. It is a manufactured, soft-feeling, quietly elegant\r\n      sort; a sort _perfide!_ Alas then, is man’s civilisation only a\r\n      wrappage, through which the savage nature of him can still burst,\r\n      infernal as ever? Nature still makes him; and has an Infernal in\r\n      her as well as a Celestial.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 3.VI.\r\n      THERMIDOR\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.I.\r\n      The Gods are athirst.\r\n\r\n      What then is this Thing, called _La Révolution_, which, like an\r\n      Angel of Death, hangs over France, noyading, fusillading,\r\n      fighting, gun-boring, tanning human skins? _La Révolution_ is but\r\n      so many Alphabetic Letters; a thing nowhere to be laid hands on,\r\n      to be clapt under lock and key: where is it? what is it? It is\r\n      the Madness that dwells in the hearts of men. In this man it is,\r\n      and in that man; as a rage or as a terror, it is in all men.\r\n      Invisible, impalpable; and yet no black Azrael, with wings spread\r\n      over half a continent, with sword sweeping from sea to sea, could\r\n      be a truer Reality.\r\n\r\n      To explain, what is called explaining, the march of this\r\n      Revolutionary Government, be no task of ours. Men cannot explain\r\n      it. A paralytic Couthon, asking in the Jacobins, “what hast thou\r\n      done to be hanged if the Counter-Revolution should arrive;” a\r\n      sombre Saint-Just, not yet six-and-twenty, declaring that “for\r\n      Revolutionists there is no rest but in the tomb;” a seagreen\r\n      Robespierre converted into vinegar and gall; much more an Amar\r\n      and Vadier, a Collot and Billaud: to inquire what thoughts,\r\n      predetermination or prevision, might be in the head of these men!\r\n      Record of their thought remains not; Death and Darkness have\r\n      swept it out utterly. Nay if we even had their thought, all they\r\n      could have articulately spoken to us, how insignificant a\r\n      fraction were that of the Thing which realised itself, which\r\n      decreed itself, on signal given by them! As has been said more\r\n      than once, this Revolutionary Government is not a self-conscious\r\n      but a blind fatal one. Each man, enveloped in his\r\n      ambient-atmosphere of revolutionary fanatic Madness, rushes on,\r\n      impelled and impelling; and has become a blind brute Force; no\r\n      rest for him but in the grave! Darkness and the mystery of horrid\r\n      cruelty cover it for us, in History; as they did in Nature. The\r\n      chaotic Thunder-cloud, with its pitchy black, and its tumult of\r\n      dazzling jagged fire, in a world all electric: thou wilt not\r\n      undertake to shew how that comported itself,—what the secrets of\r\n      its dark womb were; from what sources, with what specialities,\r\n      the lightning it held did, in confused brightness of terror,\r\n      strike forth, destructive and self-destructive, till it ended?\r\n      Like a Blackness naturally of Erebus, which by will of Providence\r\n      had for once mounted itself into dominion and the Azure: is not\r\n      this properly the nature of Sansculottism consummating itself? Of\r\n      which Erebus Blackness be it enough to discern that this and the\r\n      other dazzling fire-bolt, dazzling fire-torrent, does by small\r\n      Volition and great Necessity, verily issue,—in such and such\r\n      succession; destructive so and so, self-destructive so and so:\r\n      till it end.\r\n\r\n      Royalism is extinct, “sunk,” as they say, “in the mud of the\r\n      Loire;” Republicanism dominates without and within: what,\r\n      therefore, on the 15th day of March, 1794, is this? Arrestment,\r\n      sudden really as a bolt out of the Blue, has hit strange victims:\r\n      Hébert _Père Duchene_, Bibliopolist Momoro, Clerk Vincent,\r\n      General Ronsin; high Cordelier Patriots, redcapped Magistrates of\r\n      Paris, Worshippers of Reason, Commanders of Revolutionary Army!\r\n      Eight short days ago, their Cordelier Club was loud, and louder\r\n      than ever, with Patriot denunciations. Hébert _Père Duchene_ had\r\n      ‘held his tongue and his heart these two months, at sight of\r\n      Moderates, Crypto-Aristocrats, Camilles, _Scélérats_ in the\r\n      Convention itself: but could not do it any longer; would, if\r\n      other remedy were not, invoke the Sacred right of Insurrection.’\r\n      So spake Hébert in Cordelier Session; with vivats, till the roofs\r\n      rang again.[735] Eight short days ago; and now already! They rub\r\n      their eyes: it is no dream; they find themselves in the\r\n      Luxembourg. Goose Gobel too; and they that burnt Churches!\r\n      Chaumette himself, potent Procureur, _Agent National_ as they now\r\n      call it, who could “recognise the Suspect by the very face of\r\n      them,” he lingers but three days; on the third day he too is\r\n      hurled in. Most chopfallen, blue, enters the National Agent this\r\n      Limbo whither he has sent so many. Prisoners crowd round, jibing\r\n      and jeering: ‘Sublime National Agent,’ says one, ‘in virtue of\r\n      thy immortal Proclamation, lo there! I am suspect, thou art\r\n      suspect, he is suspect, we are suspect, ye are suspect, they are\r\n      suspect!’\r\n\r\n      The meaning of these things? Meaning! It is a Plot; Plot of the\r\n      most extensive ramifications; which, however, Barrère holds the\r\n      threads of. Such Church-burning and scandalous masquerades of\r\n      Atheism, fit to make the Revolution odious: where indeed could\r\n      they originate but in the gold of Pitt? Pitt indubitably, as\r\n      Preternatural Insight will teach one, did hire this Faction of\r\n      _Enragés_, to play their fantastic tricks; to roar in their\r\n      Cordeliers Club about Moderatism; to print their _Père Duchene;_\r\n      worship skyblue Reason in red nightcap; rob all Altars,—and bring\r\n      the spoil to _us!_\r\n\r\n      Still more indubitable, visible to the mere bodily sight, is\r\n      this: that the Cordeliers Club sits pale, with anger and terror;\r\n      and has “veiled the Rights of Man,”—without effect. Likewise that\r\n      the Jacobins are in considerable confusion; busy “purging\r\n      themselves, “_s’épurant_,” as, in times of Plot and public\r\n      Calamity, they have repeatedly had to do. Not even Camille\r\n      Desmoulins but has given offence: nay there have risen murmurs\r\n      against Danton himself; though he bellowed them down, and\r\n      Robespierre finished the matter by “embracing him in the\r\n      Tribune.”\r\n\r\n      Whom shall the Republic and a jealous Mother Society trust? In\r\n      these times of temptation, of Preternatural Insight! For there\r\n      are Factions of the Stranger, “de _l”étranger_,” Factions of\r\n      Moderates, of Enraged; all manner of Factions: we walk in a world\r\n      of Plots; strings, universally spread, of deadly gins and\r\n      falltraps, baited by the gold of Pitt! Clootz, Speaker of Mankind\r\n      so-called, with his _Evidences of Mahometan Religion_, and babble\r\n      of Universal Republic, him an incorruptible Robespierre has\r\n      purged away. Baron Clootz, and Paine rebellious Needleman lie,\r\n      these two months, in the Luxembourg; limbs of the Faction _de\r\n      l’étranger_. Representative Phélippeaux is purged out: he came\r\n      back from La Vendée with an ill report in his mouth against rogue\r\n      Rossignol, and our method of warfare there. Recant it, O\r\n      Phélippeaux, we entreat thee! Phélippeaux will not recant; and is\r\n      purged out. Representative Fabre d’Eglantine, famed Nomenclator\r\n      of Romme’s Calendar, is purged out; nay, is cast into the\r\n      Luxembourg: accused of Legislative Swindling “in regard to monies\r\n      of the India Company.” There with his Chabots, Bazires, guilty of\r\n      the like, let Fabre wait his destiny. And Westermann friend of\r\n      Danton, he who led the Marseillese on the Tenth of August, and\r\n      fought well in La Vendée, but spoke not well of rogue Rossignol,\r\n      is purged out. Lucky, if he too go not to the Luxembourg. And\r\n      your Prolys, Guzmans, of the Faction of the Stranger, they have\r\n      gone; Peyreyra, though he fled is gone, “taken in the disguise of\r\n      a Tavern Cook.” I am suspect, thou art suspect, he is suspect!—\r\n\r\n      The great heart of Danton is weary of it. Danton is gone to\r\n      native Arcis, for a little breathing time of peace: Away, black\r\n      Arachne-webs, thou world of Fury, Terror, and Suspicion; welcome,\r\n      thou everlasting Mother, with thy spring greenness, thy kind\r\n      household loves and memories; true art thou, were all else\r\n      untrue! The great Titan walks silent, by the banks of the\r\n      murmuring Aube, in young native haunts that knew him when a boy;\r\n      wonders what the end of these things may be.\r\n\r\n      But strangest of all, Camille Desmoulins is purged out. Couthon\r\n      gave as a test in regard to Jacobin purgation the question, “What\r\n      hast thou done to be hanged if Counter-Revolution should arrive?”\r\n      Yet Camille, who could so well answer this question, is purged\r\n      out! The truth is, Camille, early in December last, began\r\n      publishing a new Journal, or Series of Pamphlets, entitled the\r\n      _Vieux Cordelier_, Old Cordelier. Camille, not afraid at one time\r\n      to “embrace Liberty on a heap of dead bodies,” begins to ask now,\r\n      Whether among so many arresting and punishing Committees there\r\n      ought not to be a “Committee of Mercy?” Saint-Just, he observes,\r\n      is an extremely solemn young Republican, who “carries his head as\r\n      if it were a _Saint-Sacrement;_ adorable Hostie, or divine\r\n      Real-Presence! Sharply enough, this _old_ Cordelier, Danton and\r\n      he were of the earliest primary Cordeliers,—shoots his glittering\r\n      war-shafts into your _new_ Cordeliers, your Héberts, Momoros,\r\n      with their brawling brutalities and despicabilities: say, as the\r\n      Sun-god (for poor Camille is a Poet) shot into that Python\r\n      Serpent sprung of mud.\r\n\r\n      Whereat, as was natural, the Hébertist Python did hiss and writhe\r\n      amazingly; and threaten “sacred right of Insurrection;”—and, as\r\n      we saw, get cast into Prison. Nay, with all the old wit,\r\n      dexterity, and light graceful poignancy, Camille, translating\r\n      “out of _Tacitus_, from the Reign of Tiberius,” pricks into the\r\n      _Law of the Suspect_ itself; making it odious! Twice, in the\r\n      Decade, his wild Leaves issue; full of wit, nay of humour, of\r\n      harmonious ingenuity and insight,—one of the strangest phenomenon\r\n      of that dark time; and smite, in their wild-sparkling way, at\r\n      various monstrosities, Saint-Sacrament heads, and Juggernaut\r\n      idols, in a rather reckless manner. To the great joy of Josephine\r\n      Beauharnais, and the other Five Thousand and odd Suspect, who\r\n      fill the Twelve Houses of Arrest; on whom a ray of hope dawns!\r\n      Robespierre, at first approbatory, knew not at last what to\r\n      think; then thought, with his Jacobins, that Camille must be\r\n      expelled. A man of true Revolutionary spirit, this Camille; but\r\n      with the unwisest sallies; whom Aristocrats and Moderates have\r\n      the art to corrupt! Jacobinism is in uttermost crisis and\r\n      struggle: enmeshed wholly in plots, corruptibilities, neck-gins\r\n      and baited falltraps of Pitt _Ennemi du Genre Humain_. Camille’s\r\n      First Number begins with “O Pitt!”—his last is dated 15 Pluviose\r\n      Year 2, 3d February 1794; and ends with these words of\r\n      Montezuma’s, “_Les dieux ont soif_, The gods are athirst.”\r\n\r\n      Be this as it may, the Hébertists lie in Prison only some nine\r\n      days. On the 24th of March, therefore, the Revolution Tumbrils\r\n      carry through that Life-tumult a new cargo: Hébert, Vincent,\r\n      Momoro, Ronsin, Nineteen of them in all; with whom, curious\r\n      enough, sits Clootz Speaker of Mankind. They have been massed\r\n      swiftly into a lump, this miscellany of Nondescripts; and travel\r\n      now their last road. No help. They too must “look through the\r\n      little window;” they too “must sneeze into the sack,” _éternuer\r\n      dans le sac;_ as they have done to others so is it done to them.\r\n      _Sainte-Guillotine_, meseems, is worse than the old Saints of\r\n      Superstition; a man-devouring Saint? Clootz, still with an air of\r\n      polished sarcasm, endeavours to jest, to offer cheering\r\n      “arguments of Materialism;” he requested to be executed last, “in\r\n      order to establish certain principles,”—which Philosophy has not\r\n      retained. General Ronsin too, he still looks forth with some air\r\n      of defiance, eye of command: the rest are sunk in a stony\r\n      paleness of despair. Momoro, poor Bibliopolist, no Agrarian Law\r\n      yet realised,—they might as well have hanged thee at Evreux,\r\n      twenty months ago, when Girondin Buzot hindered them. Hébert\r\n      _Père Duchesne_ shall never in this world rise in sacred right of\r\n      insurrection; he sits there low enough, head sunk on breast; Red\r\n      Nightcaps shouting round him, in frightful parody of his\r\n      Newspaper Articles, ‘Grand choler of the Père Duchesne!’ Thus\r\n      perish they; the sack receives all their heads. Through some\r\n      section of History, Nineteen spectre-chimeras shall flit,\r\n      speaking and gibbering; till Oblivion swallow them.\r\n\r\n      In the course of a week, the Revolutionary Army itself is\r\n      disbanded; the General having become spectral. This Faction of\r\n      Rabids, therefore, is also purged from the Republican soil; here\r\n      also the baited falltraps of that Pitt have been wrenched up\r\n      harmless; and anew there is joy over a Plot Discovered. The\r\n      Revolution then is verily devouring its own children. All\r\n      Anarchy, by the nature of it, is not only destructive but\r\n      self-destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.II.\r\n      Danton, No Weakness.\r\n\r\n      Danton, meanwhile, has been pressingly sent for from Arcis: he\r\n      must return instantly, cried Camille, cried Phélippeaux and\r\n      Friends, who scented danger in the wind. Danger enough! A Danton,\r\n      a Robespierre, chief-products of a victorious Revolution, are now\r\n      arrived in immediate front of one another; must ascertain how\r\n      they will live together, rule together. One conceives easily the\r\n      deep mutual incompatibility that divided these two: with what\r\n      terror of feminine hatred the poor seagreen Formula looked at the\r\n      monstrous colossal Reality, and grew greener to behold him;—the\r\n      Reality, again, struggling to think no ill of a chief-product of\r\n      the Revolution; yet feeling at bottom that such chief-product was\r\n      little other than a chief wind-bag, blown large by Popular air;\r\n      not a man with the heart of a man, but a poor spasmodic\r\n      incorruptible pedant, with a logic-formula instead of heart; of\r\n      Jesuit or Methodist-Parson nature; full of sincere-cant,\r\n      incorruptibility, of virulence, poltroonery; barren as the\r\n      east-wind! Two such chief-products are too much for one\r\n      Revolution.\r\n\r\n      Friends, trembling at the results of a quarrel on their part,\r\n      brought them to meet. ‘It is right,’ said Danton, swallowing much\r\n      indignation, ‘to repress the Royalists: but we should not strike\r\n      except where it is useful to the Republic; we should not confound\r\n      the innocent and the guilty.’—‘And who told you,’ replied\r\n      Robespierre with a poisonous look, ‘that one innocent person had\r\n      perished?’—‘_Quoi_,’ said Danton, turning round to Friend Paris\r\n      self-named Fabricius, Juryman in the Revolutionary Tribunal:\r\n      ‘_Quoi_, not one innocent? What sayest thou of it,\r\n      Fabricius!’[736]—Friends, Westermann, this Pâris and others urged\r\n      him to shew himself, to ascend the Tribune and act. The man\r\n      Danton was not prone to shew himself; to act, or uproar for his\r\n      own safety. A man of careless, large, hoping nature; a large\r\n      nature that could rest: he would sit whole hours, they say,\r\n      hearing Camille talk, and liked nothing so well. Friends urged\r\n      him to fly; his Wife urged him: ‘Whither fly?’ answered he: ‘If\r\n      freed France cast me out, there are only dungeons for me\r\n      elsewhere. One carries not his country with him at the sole of\r\n      his shoe!’ The man Danton sat still. Not even the arrestment of\r\n      Friend Herault, a member of _Salut_, yet arrested by _Salut_, can\r\n      rouse Danton.—On the night of the 30th of March, Juryman Paris\r\n      came rushing in; haste looking through his eyes: A clerk of the\r\n      _Salut_ Committee had told him Danton’s warrant was made out, he\r\n      is to be arrested this very night! Entreaties there are and\r\n      trepidation, of poor Wife, of Paris and Friends: Danton sat\r\n      silent for a while; then answered, ‘_Ils n’oseraient_, They dare\r\n      not;’ and would take no measures. Murmuring ‘They dare not,’ he\r\n      goes to sleep as usual.\r\n\r\n      And yet, on the morrow morning, strange rumour spreads over Paris\r\n      City: Danton, Camille, Phélippeaux, Lacroix have been arrested\r\n      overnight! It is verily so: the corridors of the Luxembourg were\r\n      all crowded, Prisoners crowding forth to see this giant of the\r\n      Revolution among them. ‘Messieurs,’ said Danton politely, ‘I\r\n      hoped soon to have got you all out of this: but here I am myself;\r\n      and one sees not where it will end.’—Rumour may spread over\r\n      Paris: the Convention clusters itself into groups; wide-eyed,\r\n      whispering, ‘Danton arrested!’ Who then is safe? Legendre,\r\n      mounting the Tribune, utters, at his own peril, a feeble word for\r\n      him; moving that he be heard at that Bar before indictment; but\r\n      Robespierre frowns him down: ‘Did you hear Chabot, or Bazire?\r\n      Would you have two weights and measures?’ Legendre cowers low;\r\n      Danton, like the others, must take his doom.\r\n\r\n      Danton’s Prison-thoughts were curious to have; but are not given\r\n      in any quantity: indeed few such remarkable men have been left so\r\n      obscure to us as this Titan of the Revolution. He was heard to\r\n      ejaculate: ‘This time twelvemonth, I was moving the creation of\r\n      that same Revolutionary Tribunal. I crave pardon for it of God\r\n      and man. They are all Brothers Cain: Brissot would have had me\r\n      guillotined as Robespierre now will. I leave the whole business\r\n      in a frightful welter (_gâchis épouvantable_): not one of them\r\n      understands anything of government. Robespierre will follow me; I\r\n      drag down Robespierre. O, it were better to be a poor fisherman\r\n      than to meddle with governing of men.’—Camille’s young beautiful\r\n      Wife, who had made him rich not in money alone, hovers round the\r\n      Luxembourg, like a disembodied spirit, day and night. Camille’s\r\n      stolen letters to her still exist; stained with the mark of his\r\n      tears.[737] ‘I carry my head like a Saint-Sacrament?’ so\r\n      Saint-Just was heard to mutter: ‘Perhaps he will carry his like a\r\n      Saint-Dennis.’\r\n\r\n      Unhappy Danton, thou still unhappier light Camille, once light\r\n      _Procureur de la Lanterne_, ye also have arrived, then, at the\r\n      Bourne of Creation, where, like Ulysses Polytlas at the limit and\r\n      utmost Gades of his voyage, gazing into that dim Waste beyond\r\n      Creation, a man does see _the Shade of his Mother_, pale,\r\n      ineffectual;—and days when his Mother nursed and wrapped him are\r\n      all-too sternly contrasted with this day! Danton, Camille,\r\n      Herault, Westermann, and the others, very strangely massed up\r\n      with Bazires, Swindler Chabots, Fabre d’Eglantines, Banker Freys,\r\n      a most motley Batch, “_Fournée_” as such things will be called,\r\n      stand ranked at the Bar of Tinville. It is the 2d of April 1794.\r\n      Danton has had but three days to lie in Prison; for the time\r\n      presses.\r\n\r\n      What is your name? place of abode? and the like, Fouquier asks;\r\n      according to formality. ‘My name is Danton,’ answers he; ‘a name\r\n      tolerably known in the Revolution: my abode will soon be\r\n      Annihilation (_dans le Néant_); but I shall live in the Pantheon\r\n      of History.’ A man will endeavour to say something forcible, be\r\n      it by nature or not! Herault mentions epigrammatically that he\r\n      ‘sat in this Hall, and was detested of Parlementeers.’ Camille\r\n      makes answer, ‘My age is that of the _bon Sansculotte Jésus;_ an\r\n      age fatal to Revolutionists.’ O Camille, Camille! And yet in that\r\n      Divine Transaction, let us say, there did lie, among other\r\n      things, the fatallest Reproof ever uttered here below to Worldly\r\n      Right-honourableness; “the highest Fact,” so devout Novalis calls\r\n      it, “in the Rights of Man.” Camille’s real age, it would seem, is\r\n      thirty-four. Danton is one year older.\r\n\r\n      Some five months ago, the Trial of the Twenty-two Girondins was\r\n      the greatest that Fouquier had then done. But here is a still\r\n      greater to do; a thing which tasks the whole faculty of Fouquier;\r\n      which makes the very heart of him waver. For it is the voice of\r\n      Danton that reverberates now from these domes; in passionate\r\n      words, piercing with their wild sincerity, winged with wrath.\r\n      Your best Witnesses he shivers into ruin at one stroke. He\r\n      demands that the Committee-men themselves come as Witnesses, as\r\n      Accusers; he ‘will cover them with ignominy.’ He raises his huge\r\n      stature, he shakes his huge black head, fire flashes from the\r\n      eyes of him,—piercing to all Republican hearts: so that the very\r\n      Galleries, though we filled them by ticket, murmur sympathy; and\r\n      are like to burst down, and raise the People, and deliver him! He\r\n      complains loudly that he is classed with Chabots, with swindling\r\n      Stockjobbers; that his Indictment is a list of platitudes and\r\n      horrors. ‘Danton hidden on the Tenth of August?’ reverberates he,\r\n      with the roar of a lion in the toils: ‘Where are the men that had\r\n      to press Danton to shew himself, that day? Where are these\r\n      high-gifted souls of whom he borrowed energy? Let them appear,\r\n      these Accusers of mine: I have all the clearness of my\r\n      self-possession when I demand them. I will unmask the three\r\n      shallow scoundrels,’ _les trois plats coquins_, Saint-Just,\r\n      Couthon, Lebas, ‘who fawn on Robespierre, and lead him towards\r\n      his destruction. Let them produce themselves here; I will plunge\r\n      them into Nothingness, out of which they ought never to have\r\n      risen.’ The agitated President agitates his bell; enjoins\r\n      calmness, in a vehement manner: ‘What is it to thee how I defend\r\n      myself?’ cries the other: ‘the right of _dooming_ me is thine\r\n      always. The voice of a man speaking for his honour and his life\r\n      may well drown the jingling of thy bell!’ Thus Danton, higher and\r\n      higher; till the lion voice of him “dies away in his throat:”\r\n      speech will not utter what is in that man. The Galleries murmur\r\n      ominously; the first day’s Session is over.\r\n\r\n      O Tinville, President Herman, what will ye do? They have two days\r\n      more of it, by strictest Revolutionary Law. The Galleries already\r\n      murmur. If this Danton were to burst your mesh-work!—Very curious\r\n      indeed to consider. It turns on a hair: and what a Hoitytoity\r\n      were _there_, Justice and Culprit changing places; and the whole\r\n      History of France running changed! For in France there is this\r\n      Danton only that could still try to govern France. He only, the\r\n      wild amorphous Titan;—and perhaps that other olive-complexioned\r\n      individual, the Artillery Officer at Toulon, whom we left pushing\r\n      his fortune in the South?\r\n\r\n      On the evening of the second day, matters looking not better but\r\n      worse and worse, Fouquier and Herman, distraction in their\r\n      aspect, rush over to _Salut Public_. What is to be done? _Salut\r\n      Public_ rapidly concocts a new Decree; whereby if men “insult\r\n      Justice,” they may be “thrown out of the Debates.” For indeed,\r\n      withal, is there not “a Plot in the Luxembourg Prison?”\r\n      _Ci-devant_ General Dillon, and others of the Suspect, plotting\r\n      with Camille’s Wife to distribute _assignats;_ to force the\r\n      Prisons, overset the Republic? Citizen Laflotte, himself Suspect\r\n      but desiring enfranchisement, has reported said Plot for us:—a\r\n      report that may bear fruit! Enough, on the morrow morning, an\r\n      obedient Convention passes this Decree. _Salut_ rushes off with\r\n      it to the aid of Tinville, reduced now almost to extremities. And\r\n      so, _Hors des Débats_, Out of the Debates, ye insolents!\r\n      Policemen do your duty! In such manner, with a deadlift effort,\r\n      _Salut_, Tinville Herman, Leroi _Dix-Août_, and all stanch\r\n      jurymen setting heart and shoulder to it, the Jury becomes\r\n      “sufficiently instructed;” Sentence is passed, is sent by an\r\n      Official, and torn and trampled on: _Death this day_. It is the\r\n      5th of April, 1794. Camille’s poor Wife may cease hovering about\r\n      this Prison. Nay let her kiss her poor children; and prepare to\r\n      enter it, and to follow!—\r\n\r\n      Danton carried a high look in the Death-cart. Not so Camille: it\r\n      is but one week, and all is so topsy-turvied; angel Wife left\r\n      weeping; love, riches, Revolutionary fame, left all at the\r\n      Prison-gate; carnivorous Rabble now howling round. Palpable, and\r\n      yet incredible; like a madman’s dream! Camille struggles and\r\n      writhes; his shoulders shuffle the loose coat off them, which\r\n      hangs knotted, the hands tied: ‘Calm my friend,’ said Danton;\r\n      ‘heed not that vile canaille (_laissez là cette vile canaille_).’\r\n      At the foot of the Scaffold, Danton was heard to ejaculate: ‘O my\r\n      Wife, my well-beloved, I shall never see thee more then!’—but,\r\n      interrupting himself: ‘Danton, no weakness!’ He said to\r\n      Hérault-Séchelles stepping forward to embrace him: ‘Our heads\r\n      will meet _there_,’ in the Headsman’s sack. His last words were\r\n      to Samson the Headsman himself: ‘Thou wilt shew my head to the\r\n      people; it is worth shewing.’\r\n\r\n      So passes, like a gigantic mass, of valour, ostentation, fury,\r\n      affection and wild revolutionary manhood, this Danton, to his\r\n      unknown home. He was of Arcis-sur-Aube; born of “good\r\n      farmer-people” there. He had many sins; but one worst sin he had\r\n      not, that of Cant. No hollow Formalist, deceptive and\r\n      self-deceptive, _ghastly_ to the natural sense, was this; but a\r\n      very Man: with all his dross he was a Man; fiery-real, from the\r\n      great fire-bosom of Nature herself. He saved France from\r\n      Brunswick; he walked straight his own wild road, whither it led\r\n      him. He may live for some generations in the memory of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.III.\r\n      The Tumbrils.\r\n\r\n      Next week, it is still but the 10th of April, there comes a new\r\n      Nineteen; Chaumette, Gobel, Hébert’s Widow, the Widow of Camille:\r\n      these also roll their fated journey; black Death devours them.\r\n      Mean Hébert’s Widow was weeping, Camille’s Widow tried to speak\r\n      comfort to her. O ye kind Heavens, azure, beautiful, eternal\r\n      behind your tempests and Time-clouds, is there not pity for all!\r\n      Gobel, it seems, was repentant; he begged absolution of a Priest;\r\n      did as a Gobel best could. For Anaxagoras Chaumette, the sleek\r\n      head now stript of its _bonnet rouge_, what hope is there? Unless\r\n      Death _were_ “an eternal sleep?” Wretched Anaxagoras, God shall\r\n      judge thee, not I.\r\n\r\n      Hébert, therefore, is gone, and the Hébertists; they that robbed\r\n      Churches, and adored blue Reason in red nightcap. Great Danton,\r\n      and the Dantonists; they also are gone. Down to the catacombs;\r\n      they are become silent men! Let no Paris Municipality, no Sect or\r\n      Party of this hue or that, resist the will of Robespierre and\r\n      _Salut_. Mayor Pache, not prompt enough in denouncing these Pitts\r\n      Plots, may congratulate about them now. Never so heartily; it\r\n      skills not! His course likewise is to the Luxembourg. We appoint\r\n      one Fleuriot-Lescot Interim-Mayor in his stead: an “architect\r\n      from Belgium,” they say, this Fleuriot; he is a man one can\r\n      depend on. Our new Agent-National is Payan, lately Juryman; whose\r\n      cynosure also is Robespierre.\r\n\r\n      Thus then, we perceive, this confusedly electric Erebus-cloud of\r\n      Revolutionary Government has altered its shape somewhat. Two\r\n      masses, or wings, belonging to it; an over-electric mass of\r\n      Cordelier Rabids, and an under-electric of Dantonist Moderates\r\n      and Clemency-men,—these two masses, shooting bolts at one\r\n      another, so to speak, have annihilated one another. For the\r\n      Erebus-cloud, as we often remark, is of suicidal nature; and, in\r\n      jagged irregularity, darts its lightning withal into itself. But\r\n      now these two discrepant masses being mutually annihilated, it is\r\n      as if the Erebus-cloud had got to internal composure; and did\r\n      only pour its hellfire lightning on the World that lay under it.\r\n      In plain words, Terror of the Guillotine was never terrible till\r\n      now. Systole, diastole, swift and ever swifter goes the Axe of\r\n      Samson. Indictments cease by degrees to have so much as\r\n      plausibility: Fouquier chooses from the Twelve houses of Arrest\r\n      what he calls Batches, “_Fournées_,” a score or more at a time;\r\n      his Jurymen are charged to make _feu de file_, fire-filing till\r\n      the ground be _clear_. Citizen Laflotte’s report of Plot in the\r\n      Luxembourg is verily bearing fruit! If no speakable charge exist\r\n      against a man, or Batch of men, Fouquier has always this: a Plot\r\n      in the Prison. Swift and ever swifter goes Samson; up, finally,\r\n      to three score and more at a Batch! It is the highday of Death:\r\n      none but the Dead return not.\r\n\r\n      O dusky d’Espréménil, what a day is this, the 22d of April, thy\r\n      last day! The Palais Hall here is the same stone Hall, where\r\n      thou, five years ago, stoodest perorating, amid endless pathos of\r\n      rebellious Parlement, in the grey of the morning; bound to march\r\n      with d’Agoust to the Isles of Hieres. The stones are the same\r\n      stones: but the rest, Men, Rebellion, Pathos, Peroration, see! it\r\n      has all fled, like a gibbering troop of ghosts, like the\r\n      phantasms of a dying brain! With d’Espréménil, in the same line\r\n      of Tumbrils, goes the mournfullest medley. Chapelier goes,\r\n      _ci-devant_ popular President of the Constituent; whom the Menads\r\n      and Maillard met in his carriage, on the Versailles Road. Thouret\r\n      likewise, _ci-devant_ President, father of Constitutional\r\n      Law-acts; he whom we heard saying, long since, with a loud voice,\r\n      ‘The Constituent Assembly has fulfilled its mission!’ And the\r\n      noble old Malesherbes, who defended Louis and could not speak,\r\n      like a grey old rock dissolving into sudden water: he journeys\r\n      here now, with his kindred, daughters, sons and grandsons, his\r\n      Lamoignons, Châteaubriands; silent, towards Death.—One young\r\n      Châteaubriand alone is wandering amid the Natchez, by the roar of\r\n      Niagara Falls, the moan of endless forests: Welcome thou great\r\n      Nature, savage, but not false, not unkind, unmotherly; no Formula\r\n      thou, or rapid jangle of Hypothesis, Parliamentary Eloquence,\r\n      Constitution-building and the Guillotine; speak thou to me, O\r\n      Mother, and sing my sick heart thy mystic everlasting\r\n      lullaby-song, and let all the rest be far!—\r\n\r\n      Another row of Tumbrils we must notice: that which holds\r\n      Elizabeth, the Sister of Louis. Her Trial was like the rest; for\r\n      Plots, for Plots. She was among the kindliest, most innocent of\r\n      women. There sat with her, amid four-and-twenty others, a once\r\n      timorous Marchioness de Crussol; courageous now; expressing\r\n      towards her the liveliest loyalty. At the foot of the Scaffold,\r\n      Elizabeth with tears in her eyes, thanked this Marchioness; said\r\n      she was grieved she could not reward her. ‘Ah, Madame, would your\r\n      Royal Highness deign to embrace me, my wishes were\r\n      complete!’—‘Right willingly, Marquise de Crussol, and with my\r\n      whole heart.’[738] Thus they: at the foot of the Scaffold. The\r\n      Royal Family is now reduced to two: a girl and a little boy. The\r\n      boy, once named Dauphin, was taken from his Mother while she yet\r\n      lived; and given to one Simon, by trade a Cordwainer, on service\r\n      then about the Temple-Prison, to bring him up in principles of\r\n      Sansculottism. Simon taught him to drink, to swear, to sing the\r\n      _carmagnole_. Simon is now gone to the Municipality: and the poor\r\n      boy, hidden in a tower of the Temple, from which in his fright\r\n      and bewilderment and early decrepitude he wishes not to stir out,\r\n      lies perishing, “his shirt not changed for six months;” amid\r\n      squalor and darkness, lamentably,[739]—so as none but poor\r\n      Factory Children and the like are wont to perish, and _not_ be\r\n      lamented!\r\n\r\n      The Spring sends its green leaves and bright weather, bright May\r\n      brighter than ever: Death pauses not. Lavoisier famed Chemist,\r\n      shall die and not live: Chemist Lavoisier was Farmer-General\r\n      Lavoisier too, and now “all the Farmers-General are arrested;”\r\n      all, and shall give an account of their monies and incomings; and\r\n      die for “putting water in the tobacco” they sold.[740] Lavoisier\r\n      begged a fortnight more of life, to finish some experiments: but\r\n      ‘the Republic does not need such;’ the axe must do its work.\r\n      Cynic Chamfort, reading these Inscriptions of _Brotherhood or\r\n      Death_, says ‘it is a Brotherhood of Cain:’ arrested, then\r\n      liberated; then about to be arrested again, this Chamfort cuts\r\n      and slashes himself with frantic uncertain hand; gains, not\r\n      without difficulty, the refuge of death. Condorcet has lurked\r\n      deep, these many months; Argus-eyes watching and searching for\r\n      him. His concealment is become dangerous to others and himself;\r\n      he has to fly again, to skulk, round Paris, in thickets and\r\n      stone-quarries. And so at the Village of Clamars, one bleared May\r\n      morning, there enters a Figure, ragged, rough-bearded,\r\n      hunger-stricken; asks breakfast in the tavern there. Suspect, by\r\n      the look of him! ‘Servant out of place, sayest thou?’\r\n      Committee-President of Forty-Sous finds a Latin Horace on him:\r\n      ‘Art thou not one of those _Ci-devants_ that were wont to keep\r\n      servants? _Suspect!_’ He is haled forthwith, breakfast\r\n      unfinished, towards Bourg-la-Reine, on foot: he faints with\r\n      exhaustion; is set on a peasant’s horse; is flung into his damp\r\n      prison-cell: on the morrow, recollecting him, you enter;\r\n      Condorcet lies dead on the floor. They die fast, and disappear:\r\n      the Notabilities of France disappear, one after one, like lights\r\n      in a Theatre, which you are snuffing out.\r\n\r\n      Under which circumstances, is it not singular, and almost\r\n      touching, to see Paris City drawn out, in the meek May nights, in\r\n      civic ceremony, which they call “_Souper Fraternel_,” Brotherly\r\n      Supper? Spontaneous, or partially spontaneous, in the twelfth,\r\n      thirteenth, fourteenth nights of this May month, it is seen.\r\n      Along the Rue Saint-Honoré, and main Streets and Spaces, each\r\n      Citoyen brings forth what of supper the stingy _Maximum_ has\r\n      yielded him, to the open air; joins it to his neighbour’s supper;\r\n      and with common table, cheerful light burning frequent, and what\r\n      due modicum of cut-glasses and other garnish and relish is\r\n      convenient, they eat frugally together, under the kind\r\n      stars.[741] See it O Night! With cheerfully pledged wine-cup,\r\n      hobnobbing to the Reign of Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood, with\r\n      their wives in best ribands, with their little ones romping\r\n      round, the Citoyens, in frugal Love-feast, sit there. Night in\r\n      her wide empire sees nothing similar. O my brothers, why is the\r\n      reign of Brotherhood _not_ come! It is come, it shall come, say\r\n      the Citoyens frugally hobnobbing.—Ah me! these everlasting stars,\r\n      do they not look down “like glistening eyes, bright with immortal\r\n      pity, over the lot of man!”—\r\n\r\n      One lamentable thing, however, is, that individuals will attempt\r\n      assassination—of Representatives of the People. Representative\r\n      Collot, Member even of _Salut_, returning home, “about one in the\r\n      morning,” probably touched with liquor, as he is apt to be, meets\r\n      on the stairs, the cry ‘_Scélérat!_’ and also the snap of a\r\n      pistol: which latter flashes in the pan; disclosing to him,\r\n      momentarily, a pair of truculent saucer-eyes, swart grim-clenched\r\n      countenance; recognisable as that of our little fellow-lodger,\r\n      Citoyen Amiral, formerly “a clerk in the Lotteries!; Collot\r\n      shouts _Murder_, with lungs fit to awaken all the _Rue Favart;_\r\n      Amiral snaps a second time; a second time flashes in the pan;\r\n      then darts up into his apartment; and, after there firing, still\r\n      with inadequate effect, one musket at himself and another at his\r\n      captor, is clutched and locked in Prison.[742] An indignant\r\n      little man this Amiral, of Southern temper and complexion, of\r\n      “considerable muscular force.” He denies not that he meant to\r\n      ‘purge France of a tyrant;’ nay avows that he had an eye to the\r\n      Incorruptible himself, but took Collot as more convenient!\r\n\r\n      Rumour enough hereupon; heaven-high congratulation of Collot,\r\n      fraternal embracing, at the Jacobins, and elsewhere. And yet, it\r\n      would seem the assassin-mood proves catching. Two days more, it\r\n      is still but the 23d of May, and towards nine in the evening,\r\n      Cecile Renault, Paper-dealer’s daughter, a young woman of soft\r\n      blooming look, presents herself at the Cabinet-maker’s in the Rue\r\n      Saint-Honoré; desires to see Robespierre. Robespierre cannot be\r\n      seen: she grumbles irreverently. They lay hold of her. She has\r\n      left a basket in a shop hard by: in the basket are female change\r\n      of raiment and two knives! Poor Cecile, examined by Committee,\r\n      declares she ‘wanted to see what a tyrant was like:’ the change\r\n      of raiment was ‘for my own use in the place I am surely going\r\n      to.’—‘What place?’—‘Prison; and then the Guillotine,’ answered\r\n      she.—Such things come of Charlotte Corday; in a people prone to\r\n      imitation, and monomania! Swart choleric men try Charlotte’s\r\n      feat, and their pistols miss fire; soft blooming young women try\r\n      it, and, only half-resolute, leave their knives in a shop.\r\n\r\n      O Pitt, and ye Faction of the Stranger, shall the Republic never\r\n      have rest; but be torn continually by baited springs, by wires of\r\n      explosive spring-guns? Swart Amiral, fair young Cecile, and all\r\n      that knew them, and many that did not know them, lie locked,\r\n      waiting the scrutiny of Tinville.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.IV.\r\n      Mumbo-Jumbo.\r\n\r\n      But on the day they call _Décadi_, New-Sabbath, 20 _Prairial_,\r\n      8th June by old style, what thing is this going forward, in the\r\n      Jardin National, whilom Tuileries Garden?\r\n\r\n      All the world is there, in holydays clothes:[743] foul linen went\r\n      out with the Hébertists; nay Robespierre, for one, would never\r\n      once countenance that; but went always elegant and frizzled, not\r\n      without vanity even,—and had his room hung round with seagreen\r\n      Portraits and Busts. In holyday clothes, we say, are the\r\n      innumerable Citoyens and Citoyennes: the weather is of the\r\n      brightest; cheerful expectation lights all countenances. Juryman\r\n      Vilate gives breakfast to many a Deputy, in his official\r\n      Apartment, in the Pavillon _ci-devant_ of Flora; rejoices in the\r\n      bright-looking multitudes, in the brightness of leafy June, in\r\n      the auspicious _Décadi_, or New-Sabbath. This day, if it please\r\n      Heaven, we are to have, on improved Anti-Chaumette principles: a\r\n      New Religion.\r\n\r\n      Catholicism being burned out, and Reason-worship guillotined, was\r\n      there not need of one? Incorruptible Robespierre, not unlike the\r\n      Ancients, as Legislator of a free people will now also be Priest\r\n      and Prophet. He has donned his sky-blue coat, made for the\r\n      occasion; white silk waistcoat broidered with silver, black silk\r\n      breeches, white stockings, shoe-buckles of gold. He is President\r\n      of the Convention; he has made the Convention _decree_, so they\r\n      name it, _décréter_ the “Existence of the Supreme Being,” and\r\n      likewise “_ce principe consolateur_ of the Immortality of the\r\n      Soul.” These consolatory principles, the basis of rational\r\n      Republican Religion, are getting decreed; and here, on this\r\n      blessed _Décadi_, by help of Heaven and Painter David, is to be\r\n      our first act of worship.\r\n\r\n      See, accordingly, how after Decree passed, and what has been\r\n      called “the scraggiest Prophetic Discourse ever uttered by\r\n      man,”—Mahomet Robespierre, in sky-blue coat and black breeches,\r\n      frizzled and powdered to perfection, bearing in his hand a\r\n      bouquet of flowers and wheat-ears, issues proudly from the\r\n      Convention Hall; Convention following him, yet, as is remarked,\r\n      with an interval. Amphitheatre has been raised, or at least\r\n      _Monticule_ or Elevation; hideous Statues of Atheism, Anarchy and\r\n      such like, thanks to Heaven and Painter David, strike abhorrence\r\n      into the heart. Unluckily however, our Monticule is too small. On\r\n      the top of it not half of us can stand; wherefore there arises\r\n      indecent shoving, nay treasonous irreverent growling. Peace, thou\r\n      Bourdon de l’Oise; peace, or it may be worse for thee!\r\n\r\n      The seagreen Pontiff takes a torch, Painter David handing it;\r\n      mouths some other froth-rant of vocables, which happily one\r\n      cannot hear; strides resolutely forward, in sight of expectant\r\n      France; sets his torch to Atheism and Company, which are but made\r\n      of pasteboard steeped in turpentine. They burn up rapidly; and,\r\n      from within, there rises “by machinery” an incombustible Statue\r\n      of Wisdom, which, by ill hap, gets besmoked a little; but does\r\n      stand there visible in as serene attitude as it can.\r\n\r\n      And then? Why, then, there is other Processioning, scraggy\r\n      Discoursing, and—this _is_ our Feast of the _Être Suprême;_ our\r\n      new Religion, better or worse, is come!—Look at it one moment, O\r\n      Reader, not two. The Shabbiest page of Human Annals: or is there,\r\n      that thou wottest of, one shabbier? Mumbo-Jumbo of the African\r\n      woods to me seems venerable beside this new Deity of Robespierre;\r\n      for this is a _conscious_ Mumbo-Jumbo, and _knows_ that he is\r\n      machinery. O seagreen Prophet, unhappiest of windbags blown nigh\r\n      to bursting, what distracted Chimera among realities are thou\r\n      growing to! This then, this common pitch-link for artificial\r\n      fireworks of turpentine and pasteboard; _this_ is the miraculous\r\n      Aaron’s Rod thou wilt stretch over a hag-ridden hell-ridden\r\n      France, and bid her plagues cease? Vanish, thou and it!—‘_Avec\r\n      ton Être Suprême_,’ said Billaud, ‘_tu commences à m’embêter:_\r\n      With thy _Être Suprême_ thou beginnest to be a bore to me.’[744]\r\n\r\n      Catherine Théot, on the other hand, “an ancient serving-maid\r\n      seventy-nine years of age,” inured to Prophecy and the Bastille\r\n      from of old, sits, in an upper room in the Rue-de-Contrescarpe,\r\n      poring over the Book of Revelations, with an eye to Robespierre;\r\n      finds that this astonishing thrice-potent Maximilien really is\r\n      the Man spoken of by Prophets, who is to make the Earth young\r\n      again. With her sit devout old Marchionesses, _ci-devant_\r\n      honourable women; among whom Old-Constituent Dom Gerle, with his\r\n      addle head, cannot be wanting. They sit there, in the\r\n      Rue-de-Contrescarpe; in mysterious adoration: Mumbo is Mumbo, and\r\n      Robespierre is his Prophet. A conspicuous man this Robespierre.\r\n      He has his volunteer Bodyguard of _Tappe-durs_, let us say\r\n      _Strike-sharps_, fierce Patriots with feruled sticks; and\r\n      Jacobins kissing the hem of his garment. He enjoys the admiration\r\n      of many, the worship of some; and is well worth the wonder of one\r\n      and all.\r\n\r\n      The grand question and hope, however, is: Will not this Feast of\r\n      the Tuileries Mumbo-Jumbo be a sign perhaps that the Guillotine\r\n      is to abate? Far enough from that! Precisely on the second day\r\n      after it, Couthon, one of the “three shallow scoundrels,” gets\r\n      himself lifted into the Tribune; produces a bundle of papers.\r\n      Couthon proposes that, as Plots still abound, the _Law of the\r\n      Suspect_ shall have extension, and Arrestment new vigour and\r\n      facility. Further that, as in such case business is like to be\r\n      heavy, our Revolutionary Tribunal too shall have extension; be\r\n      divided, say, into Four Tribunals, each with its President, each\r\n      with its Fouquier or Substitute of Fouquier, all labouring at\r\n      once, and any remnant of shackle or dilatory formality be struck\r\n      off: in this way it may perhaps still overtake the work. Such is\r\n      Couthon’s _Decree of the Twenty-second Prairial_, famed in those\r\n      times. At hearing of which Decree the very Mountain gasped,\r\n      awestruck; and one Ruamps ventured to say that if it passed\r\n      without adjournment and discussion, he, as one Representative,\r\n      ‘would blow his brains out.’ Vain saying! The Incorruptible knit\r\n      his brows; spoke a prophetic fateful word or two: the _Law of\r\n      Prairial_ is Law; Ruamps glad to leave his rash brains where they\r\n      are. Death, then, and always Death! Even so. Fouquier is\r\n      enlarging his borders; making room for Batches of a Hundred and\r\n      fifty at once;—getting a Guillotine set up, of improved velocity,\r\n      and to work under cover, in the apartment close by. So that\r\n      _Salut_ itself has to intervene, and forbid him: ‘Wilt thou\r\n      _demoralise_ the Guillotine,’ asks Collot, reproachfully,\r\n      ‘_démoraliser le supplice!_’\r\n\r\n      There is indeed danger of that; were not the Republican faith\r\n      great, it were already done. See, for example, on the 17th of\r\n      June, what a _Batch_, Fifty-four at once! Swart Amiral is here,\r\n      he of the pistol that missed fire; young Cecile Renault, with her\r\n      father, family, entire kith and kin; the widow of d’Espréménil;\r\n      old M. de Sombreuil of the Invalides, with his Son,—poor old\r\n      Sombreuil, seventy-three years old, his Daughter saved him in\r\n      September, and it was but for _this_. Faction of the Stranger,\r\n      fifty-four of them! In red shirts and smocks, as Assassins and\r\n      Faction of the Stranger, they flit along there; red baleful\r\n      Phantasmagory, towards the land of Phantoms.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile will not the people of the Place de la Révolution, the\r\n      inhabitants along the Rue Saint-Honoré, as these continual\r\n      Tumbrils pass, begin to look gloomy? Republicans too have bowels.\r\n      The Guillotine is shifted, then again shifted; finally set up at\r\n      the remote extremity of the South-East:[745] Suburbs\r\n      Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau it is to be hoped, if they have\r\n      bowels, have very tough ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.V.\r\n      The Prisons.\r\n\r\n      It is time now, however, to cast a glance into the Prisons. When\r\n      Desmoulins moved for his Committee of Mercy, these Twelve Houses\r\n      of Arrest held five thousand persons. Continually arriving since\r\n      then, there have now accumulated twelve thousand. They are\r\n      Ci-devants, Royalists; in far greater part, they are Republicans,\r\n      of various Girondin, Fayettish, Un-Jacobin colour. Perhaps no\r\n      human Habitation or Prison ever equalled in squalor, in noisome\r\n      horror, these Twelve Houses of Arrest. There exist records of\r\n      personal experience in them _Mémoires sur les Prisons;_ one of\r\n      the strangest Chapters in the Biography of Man.\r\n\r\n      Very singular to look into it: how a kind of order rises up in\r\n      all conditions of human existence; and wherever two or three are\r\n      gathered together, there are formed modes of existing together,\r\n      habitudes, observances, nay gracefulnesses, joys! Citoyen Coitant\r\n      will explain fully how our lean dinner, of herbs and carrion, was\r\n      consumed not without politeness and _place-aux-dames:_ how\r\n      Seigneur and Shoeblack, Duchess and Doll-Tearsheet, flung\r\n      pellmell into a heap, ranked themselves according to method: at\r\n      what hour “the Citoyennes took to their needlework;” and we,\r\n      yielding the chairs to them, endeavoured to talk gallantly in a\r\n      standing posture, or even to sing and harp more or less.\r\n      Jealousies, enmities are not wanting; nor flirtations, of an\r\n      effective character.\r\n\r\n      Alas, by degrees, even needlework must cease: Plot in the Prison\r\n      rises, by Citoyen Laflotte and Preternatural Suspicion.\r\n      Suspicious Municipality snatches from us all implements; all\r\n      money and possession, of means or metal, is ruthlessly searched\r\n      for, in pocket, in pillow and paillasse, and snatched away;\r\n      red-capped Commissaries entering every cell! Indignation,\r\n      temporary desperation, at robbery of its very thimble, fills the\r\n      gentle heart. Old Nuns shriek shrill discord; demand to be killed\r\n      forthwith. No help from shrieking! Better was that of the two\r\n      shifty male Citizens, who, eager to preserve an implement or two,\r\n      were it but a pipe-picker, or needle to darn hose with,\r\n      determined to defend themselves: by tobacco. Swift then, as your\r\n      fell Red Caps are heard in the Corridor rummaging and slamming,\r\n      the two Citoyens light their pipes and begin smoking. Thick\r\n      darkness envelops them. The Red Nightcaps, opening the cell,\r\n      breathe but one mouthful; burst forth into chorus of barking and\r\n      coughing. ‘_Quoi, Messieurs_,’ cry the two Citoyens, ‘You don’t\r\n      smoke? Is the pipe disagreeable! _Est-ce que vous ne fumez pas?_’\r\n      But the Red Nightcaps have fled, with slight search: ‘_Vous\r\n      n’aimez pas la pipe?_’ cry the Citoyens, as their door slams-to\r\n      again.[746] My poor brother Citoyens, O surely, in a reign of\r\n      Brotherhood, you are not the two I would guillotine!\r\n\r\n      Rigour grows, stiffens into horrid tyranny; Plot in the Prison\r\n      getting ever riper. This Plot in the Prison, as we said, is now\r\n      the stereotype formula of Tinville: against whomsoever he knows\r\n      no crime, this is a ready-made crime. His Judgment-bar has become\r\n      unspeakable; a recognised mockery; known only as the wicket one\r\n      passes through, towards Death. His Indictments are drawn out in\r\n      blank; you insert the Names after. He has his _moutons_,\r\n      detestable traitor jackalls, who report and bear witness; that\r\n      they themselves may be allowed to live,—for a time. His\r\n      _Fournées_, says the reproachful Collot, “shall in no case exceed\r\n      three-score;” that is his _maximum_. Nightly come his Tumbrils to\r\n      the Luxembourg, with the fatal Roll-call; list of the _Fournée_\r\n      of tomorrow. Men rush towards the Grate; listen, if their name be\r\n      in it? One deep-drawn breath, when the name is not in: we live\r\n      still one day! And yet some score or scores of names were in.\r\n      Quick these; they clasp their loved ones to their heart, one last\r\n      time; with brief adieu, wet-eyed or dry-eyed, they mount, and are\r\n      away. This night to the Conciergerie; through the Palais misnamed\r\n      _of Justice_, to the Guillotine tomorrow.\r\n\r\n      Recklessness, defiant levity, the Stoicism if not of strength yet\r\n      of weakness, has possessed all hearts. Weak women and\r\n      _Ci-devants_, their locks not yet made into blond perukes, their\r\n      skins not yet tanned into breeches, are accustomed to “act the\r\n      Guillotine” by way of pastime. In fantastic mummery, with\r\n      towel-turbans, blanket-ermine, a mock Sanhedrim of Judges sits, a\r\n      mock Tinville pleads; a culprit is doomed, is guillotined by the\r\n      oversetting of two chairs. Sometimes we carry it farther:\r\n      Tinville himself, in his turn, is doomed, and not to the\r\n      Guillotine alone. With blackened face, hirsute, horned, a shaggy\r\n      Satan snatches him not unshrieking; shews him, with outstretched\r\n      arm and voice, the fire that is not quenched, the worm that dies\r\n      not; the monotony of Hell-pain, and the _What hour?_ answered by,\r\n      _It is Eternity!_[747]\r\n\r\n      And still the Prisons fill fuller, and still the Guillotine goes\r\n      faster. On all high roads march flights of Prisoners, wending\r\n      towards Paris. Not _Ci-devants_ now; they, the noisy of them, are\r\n      mown down; it is Republicans now. Chained two and two they march;\r\n      in exasperated moments, singing their _Marseillaise_. A hundred\r\n      and thirty-two men of Nantes for instance, march towards Paris,\r\n      in these same days: Republicans, or say even Jacobins to the\r\n      marrow of the bone; but Jacobins who had not approved\r\n      Noyading.[748] _Vive la République_ rises from them in all\r\n      streets of towns: they rest by night, in unutterable noisome\r\n      dens, crowded to choking; one or two dead on the morrow. They are\r\n      wayworn, weary of heart; can only shout: _Live the Republic;_ we,\r\n      as under horrid enchantment, dying in this way for it!\r\n\r\n      Some Four Hundred Priests, of whom also there is record, ride at\r\n      anchor, “in the roads of the Isle of Aix,” long months; looking\r\n      out on misery, vacuity, waste Sands of Oleron and the\r\n      ever-moaning brine. Ragged, sordid, hungry; wasted to shadows:\r\n      eating their unclean ration on deck, circularly, in parties of a\r\n      dozen, with finger and thumb; beating their scandalous clothes\r\n      between two stones; choked in horrible miasmata, closed under\r\n      hatches, seventy of them in a berth, through night; so that the\r\n      “aged Priest is found lying dead in the morning, in the attitude\r\n      of prayer!”[749]—How long, O Lord!\r\n\r\n      Not forever; no. All Anarchy, all Evil, Injustice, is, by the\r\n      nature of it, _dragon’s-teeth;_ suicidal, and cannot endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.VI.\r\n      To Finish the Terror.\r\n\r\n      It is very remarkable, indeed, that since the _Être-Suprême_\r\n      Feast, and the sublime continued harangues on it, which Billaud\r\n      feared would become a bore to him, Robespierre has gone little to\r\n      Committee; but held himself apart, as if in a kind of pet. Nay\r\n      they have made a Report on that old Catherine Théot, and her\r\n      Regenerative Man spoken of by the Prophets; not in the best\r\n      spirit. This Théot mystery they affect to regard as a Plot; but\r\n      have evidently introduced a vein of satire, of irreverent banter,\r\n      not against the Spinster alone, but obliquely against her\r\n      Regenerative Man! Barrère’s light pen was perhaps at the bottom\r\n      of it: read through the solemn snuffling organs of old Vadier of\r\n      the _Sûreté Générale_, the Théot Report had its effect; wrinkling\r\n      the general Republican visage into an iron grin. Ought these\r\n      things to be?\r\n\r\n      We note farther that among the Prisoners in the Twelve Houses of\r\n      Arrest, there is one whom we have seen before. Senhora Fontenai,\r\n      _born_ Cabarus, the fair Proserpine whom Representative Tallien\r\n      Pluto-like did gather at Bourdeaux, not without effect on\r\n      himself! Tallien is home, by recall, long since, from Bourdeaux;\r\n      and in the most alarming position. Vain that he sounded, louder\r\n      even than ever, the note of Jacobinism, to hide past\r\n      shortcomings: the Jacobins purged him out; two times has\r\n      Robespierre growled at him words of omen from the Convention\r\n      Tribune. And now his fair Cabarus, hit by denunciation, lies\r\n      Arrested, Suspect, in spite of all he could do!—Shut in horrid\r\n      pinfold of death, the Senhora smuggles out to her red-gloomy\r\n      Tallien the most pressing entreaties and conjurings: Save me;\r\n      save thyself. Seest thou not that thy own head is doomed; thou\r\n      with a too fiery audacity; a Dantonist withal; against whom lie\r\n      grudges? Are ye not all doomed, as in the Polyphemus Cavern; the\r\n      fawningest slave of you will be but eaten last!—Tallien feels\r\n      with a shudder that it is true. Tallien has had words of omen,\r\n      Bourdon has had words, Fréron is hated and Barras: each man\r\n      “feels his head if it yet stick on his shoulders.”\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile Robespierre, we still observe, goes little to\r\n      Convention, not at all to Committee; speaks nothing except to his\r\n      Jacobin House of Lords, amid his bodyguard of _Tappe-durs_. These\r\n      “forty-days,” for we are now far in July, he has not shewed face\r\n      in Committee; could only work there by his three shallow\r\n      scoundrels, and the terror there was of him. The Incorruptible\r\n      himself sits apart; or is seen stalking in solitary places in the\r\n      fields, with an intensely meditative air; some say, “with eyes\r\n      red-spotted,”[750] fruit of extreme bile: the lamentablest\r\n      seagreen Chimera that walks the Earth that July! O hapless\r\n      Chimera; for thou too hadst a life, and a heart of flesh,—what is\r\n      this the stern gods, seeming to smile all the way, have led and\r\n      let thee to! Art not thou he who, few years ago, was a young\r\n      Advocate of promise; and gave up the Arras Judgeship rather than\r\n      sentence one man to die?—\r\n\r\n      What his thoughts might be? His plans for finishing the Terror?\r\n      One knows not. Dim vestiges there flit of Agrarian Law; a\r\n      victorious Sansculottism become Landed Proprietor; old Soldiers\r\n      sitting in National Mansions, in Hospital Palaces of Chambord and\r\n      Chantilly; peace bought by victory; breaches healed by Feast of\r\n      _Être Suprême;_—and so, through seas of blood, to Equality,\r\n      Frugality, worksome Blessedness, Fraternity, and Republic of the\r\n      virtues! Blessed shore, of such a sea of Aristocrat blood: but\r\n      how to land on it? Through one last wave: blood of corrupt\r\n      Sansculottists; traitorous or semi-traitorous Conventionals,\r\n      rebellious Talliens, Billauds, to whom with my _Être Suprême_ I\r\n      have become a bore; with my Apocalyptic Old Woman a\r\n      laughing-stock!—So stalks he, this poor Robespierre, like a\r\n      seagreen ghost through the blooming July. Vestiges of schemes\r\n      flit dim. But _what_ his schemes or his thoughts were will never\r\n      be known to man.\r\n\r\n      New Catacombs, some say, are digging for a huge simultaneous\r\n      butchery. Convention to be butchered, down to the right pitch, by\r\n      General Henriot and Company: Jacobin House of Lords made\r\n      dominant; and Robespierre Dictator.[751] There is actually, or\r\n      else there is not actually, a List made out; which the\r\n      Hairdresser has got eye on, as he frizzled the Incorruptible\r\n      locks. Each man asks himself, Is it I?\r\n\r\n      Nay, as Tradition and rumour of Anecdote still convey it, there\r\n      was a remarkable bachelor’s dinner one hot day at Barrère’s. For\r\n      doubt not, O Reader, this Barrère and others of them gave\r\n      dinners; had “country-house at Clichy,” with elegant enough\r\n      sumptuosities, and pleasures high-rouged![752] But at this dinner\r\n      we speak of, the day being so hot, it is said, the guests all\r\n      stript their coats, and left them in the drawing-room: whereupon\r\n      Carnot glided out; driven by a necessity, needing of all things\r\n      _paper;_ groped in Robespierre’s pocket; found a list of Forty,\r\n      his own name among them; and tarried not at the wine-cup that\r\n      day!—Ye must bestir yourselves, O Friends; ye dull Frogs of the\r\n      Marsh, mute ever since Girondism sank under, even ye now must\r\n      croak or die! Councils are held, with word and beck; nocturnal,\r\n      mysterious as death. Does not a feline Maximilien stalk there;\r\n      voiceless as yet; his green eyes red-spotted; back bent, and hair\r\n      up? Rash Tallien, with his rash temper and audacity of tongue; he\r\n      shall _bell the cat_. Fix a day; and be it soon, lest never!\r\n\r\n      Lo, before the fixed day, on the day which they call Eighth of\r\n      Thermidor, 26th July 1794, Robespierre himself reappears in\r\n      Convention; mounts to the Tribune! The biliary face seems clouded\r\n      with new gloom; judge whether your Talliens, Bourdons listened\r\n      with interest. It is a voice bodeful of death or of life.\r\n      Long-winded, unmelodious as the screech-owl’s, sounds that\r\n      prophetic voice: Degenerate condition of Republican spirit;\r\n      corrupt moderatism; _Sûreté, Salut_ Committees themselves\r\n      infected; back-sliding on this hand and on that; I, Maximilien,\r\n      alone left incorruptible, ready to die at a moment’s warning. For\r\n      all which what remedy is there? The Guillotine; new vigour to the\r\n      all-healing Guillotine: death to traitors of every hue! So sings\r\n      the prophetic voice; into its Convention sounding-board. The old\r\n      song this: but today, O Heavens! has the sounding-board ceased to\r\n      act? There is not resonance in this Convention; there is, so to\r\n      speak, a gasp of silence; nay a certain grating of one knows not\r\n      what!—Lecointre, our old Draper of Versailles, in these\r\n      questionable circumstances, sees nothing he can do so safe as\r\n      rise, “insidiously” or not insidiously, and move, according to\r\n      established wont, that the Robespierre Speech be “printed and\r\n      sent to the Departments.” Hark: gratings, even of dissonance!\r\n      Honourable Members hint dissonance; Committee-Members, inculpated\r\n      in the Speech, utter dissonance; demand “delay in printing.” Ever\r\n      higher rises the note of dissonance; inquiry is even made by\r\n      Editor Fréron: ‘What has become of the Liberty of Opinions in\r\n      this Convention?’ The Order to print and transmit, which had got\r\n      passed, is rescinded. Robespierre, greener than ever before, has\r\n      to retire, foiled; discerning that it is mutiny, that evil is\r\n      nigh.\r\n\r\n      Mutiny is a thing of the fatallest nature in all enterprises\r\n      whatsoever; a thing so incalculable, swift-frightful; not to be\r\n      dealt with in _fright_. But mutiny in a Robespierre Convention,\r\n      above all,—it is like fire seen sputtering in the ship’s\r\n      powder-room! One death-defiant plunge at it, this moment, and you\r\n      may still tread it out: hesitate till next moment,—ship and\r\n      ship’s captain, crew and cargo are shivered far; the ship’s\r\n      voyage has suddenly ended between sea and sky. If Robespierre\r\n      can, tonight, produce his Henriot and Company, and get his work\r\n      done by them, he and Sansculottism may still subsist some time;\r\n      if not, probably not. Oliver Cromwell, when that Agitator\r\n      Serjeant stept forth from the ranks, with plea of grievances, and\r\n      began gesticulating and demonstrating, as the mouthpiece of\r\n      Thousands expectant there,—discerned, with those truculent eyes\r\n      of his, how the matter lay; plucked a pistol from his holsters;\r\n      blew Agitator and Agitation instantly out. Noll was a man fit for\r\n      such things.\r\n\r\n      Robespierre, for his part, glides over at evening to his Jacobin\r\n      House of Lords; unfolds there, instead of some adequate\r\n      resolution, his woes, his uncommon virtues, incorruptibilities;\r\n      then, secondly, his rejected screech-owl Oration;—reads this\r\n      latter over again; and declares that he is ready to die at a\r\n      moment’s warning. Thou shalt not die! shouts Jacobinism from its\r\n      thousand throats. ‘Robespierre, I will drink the hemlock with\r\n      thee,’ cries Painter David, ‘_Je boirai la cigue avec toi;_’—a\r\n      thing not essential to _do_, but which, in the fire of the\r\n      moment, can be said.\r\n\r\n      Our Jacobin sounding-board, therefore, does act! Applauses\r\n      heaven-high cover the rejected Oration; fire-eyed fury lights all\r\n      Jacobin features: Insurrection a sacred duty; the Convention to\r\n      be purged; Sovereign People under Henriot and Municipality; we\r\n      will make a new June-Second of it: to your tents, O Israel! In\r\n      this key pipes Jacobinism; in sheer tumult of revolt. Let Tallien\r\n      and all Opposition men make off. Collot d’Herbois, though of the\r\n      supreme _Salut_, and so lately near shot, is elbowed, bullied; is\r\n      glad to escape alive. Entering Committee-room of _Salut_, all\r\n      dishevelled, he finds sleek sombre Saint-Just there, among the\r\n      rest; who in his sleek way asks, ‘What is passing at the\r\n      Jacobins?’—‘What is passing?’ repeats Collot, in the unhistrionic\r\n      Cambyses’ vein: ‘What is passing? Nothing but revolt and horrors\r\n      are passing. Ye want our lives; ye shall not have them.’\r\n      Saint-Just stutters at such Cambyses’-oratory; takes his hat to\r\n      withdraw. That _Report_ he had been speaking of, Report on\r\n      Republican Things in General we may say, which is to be read in\r\n      Convention on the morrow, he cannot shew it them this moment: a\r\n      friend has it; he, Saint-Just, will get it, and send it, were he\r\n      once home. Once home, he sends not it, but an answer that he will\r\n      not send it; that they will hear it from the Tribune tomorrow.\r\n\r\n      Let every man, therefore, according to a well-known good-advice,\r\n      “pray to Heaven, and keep his powder dry!” Paris, on the morrow,\r\n      will see a thing. Swift scouts fly dim or invisible, all night,\r\n      from _Sûreté_ and _Salut;_ from conclave to conclave; from Mother\r\n      Society to Townhall. Sleep, can it fall on the eyes of Talliens,\r\n      Frérons, Collots? Puissant Henriot, Mayor Fleuriot, Judge\r\n      Coffinhal, Procureur Payan, Robespierre and all the Jacobins are\r\n      getting ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.6.VII.\r\n      Go Down to.\r\n\r\n      Tallien’s eyes beamed bright, on the morrow, Ninth of Thermidor\r\n      “about nine o’clock,” to see that the Convention had actually\r\n      met. Paris is in rumour: but at least we are met, in Legal\r\n      Convention here; we have not been snatched seriatim; treated with\r\n      a _Pride’s Purge_ at the door. ‘_Allons_, brave men of the\r\n      Plain,’ late Frogs of the Marsh! cried Tallien with a squeeze of\r\n      the hand, as he passed in; Saint-Just’s sonorous organ being now\r\n      audible from the Tribune, and the game of games begun.\r\n\r\n      Saint-Just is verily reading that Report of his; green Vengeance,\r\n      in the shape of Robespierre, watching nigh. Behold, however,\r\n      Saint-Just has read but few sentences, when interruption rises,\r\n      rapid _crescendo;_ when Tallien starts to his feet, and Billaud,\r\n      and this man starts and that,—and Tallien, a second time, with\r\n      his: ‘Citoyens, at the Jacobins last night, I trembled for the\r\n      Republic. I said to myself, if the Convention dare not strike the\r\n      Tyrant, then I myself dare; and with this I will do it, if need\r\n      be,’ said he, whisking out a clear-gleaming Dagger, and\r\n      brandishing it there: the Steel of Brutus, as we call it. Whereat\r\n      we all bellow, and brandish, impetuous acclaim. ‘Tyranny;\r\n      Dictatorship! Triumvirat!’ And the _Salut_ Committee-men accuse,\r\n      and all men accuse, and uproar, and impetuously acclaim. And\r\n      Saint-Just is standing motionless, pale of face; Couthon\r\n      ejaculating, ‘Triumvir?’ with a look at his paralytic legs. And\r\n      Robespierre is struggling to speak, but President Thuriot is\r\n      jingling the bell against him, but the Hall is sounding against\r\n      him like an Æolus-Hall: and Robespierre is mounting the\r\n      Tribune-steps and descending again; going and coming, like to\r\n      choke with rage, terror, desperation:—and mutiny is the order of\r\n      the day![753]\r\n\r\n      O President Thuriot, thou that wert Elector Thuriot, and from the\r\n      Bastille battlements sawest Saint-Antoine rising like the\r\n      Ocean-tide, and hast seen much since, sawest thou ever the like\r\n      of this? Jingle of bell, which thou jinglest against Robespierre,\r\n      is hardly audible amid the Bedlam-storm; and men rage for life.\r\n      ‘President of Assassins,’ shrieks Robespierre, ‘I demand speech\r\n      of thee for the last time!’ It cannot be had. ‘To you, O virtuous\r\n      men of the Plain,’ cries he, finding audience one moment, ‘I\r\n      appeal to you!’ The virtuous men of the Plain sit silent as\r\n      stones. And Thuriot’s bell jingles, and the Hall sounds like\r\n      Aeolus’s Hall. Robespierre’s frothing lips are grown “blue;” his\r\n      tongue dry, cleaving to the roof of his mouth. ‘The blood of\r\n      Danton chokes him,’ cry they. ‘Accusation! Decree of Accusation!’\r\n      Thuriot swiftly puts that question. Accusation passes; the\r\n      incorruptible Maximilien is decreed Accused.\r\n\r\n      ‘I demand to share my Brother’s fate, as I have striven to share\r\n      his virtues,’ cries Augustin, the Younger Robespierre: Augustin\r\n      also is decreed. And Couthon, and Saint-Just, and Lebas, they are\r\n      all decreed; and packed forth,—not without difficulty, the Ushers\r\n      almost trembling to obey. Triumvirat and Company are packed\r\n      forth, into Salut Committee-room; their tongue cleaving to the\r\n      roof of their mouth. You have but to summon the Municipality; to\r\n      cashier Commandant Henriot, and launch Arrest at him; to regular\r\n      formalities; hand Tinville his victims. It is noon: the\r\n      Aeolus-Hall has delivered itself; blows now victorious,\r\n      harmonious, as one irresistible wind.\r\n\r\n      And so the work is finished? One thinks so; and yet it is not so.\r\n      Alas, there is yet but the first-act finished; three or four\r\n      other acts still to come; and an uncertain catastrophe! A huge\r\n      City holds in it so many confusions: seven hundred thousand human\r\n      heads; not one of which knows what its neighbour is doing, nay\r\n      not what itself is doing.—See, accordingly, about three in the\r\n      afternoon, Commandant Henriot, how instead of sitting cashiered,\r\n      arrested, he gallops along the Quais, followed by Municipal\r\n      Gendarmes, “trampling down several persons!” For the Townhall\r\n      sits deliberating, openly insurgent: Barriers to be shut; no\r\n      Gaoler to admit any Prisoner this day;—and Henriot is galloping\r\n      towards the Tuileries, to deliver Robespierre. On the Quai de la\r\n      Ferraillerie, a young Citoyen, walking with his wife, says aloud:\r\n      ‘Gendarmes, that man is not your Commandant; he is under arrest.’\r\n      The Gendarmes strike down the young Citoyen with the flat of\r\n      their swords.[754]\r\n\r\n      Representatives themselves (as Merlin the Thionviller) who accost\r\n      him, this puissant Henriot flings into guardhouses. He bursts\r\n      towards the Tuileries Committee-room, ‘to speak with\r\n      Robespierre:’ with difficulty, the Ushers and Tuileries\r\n      Gendarmes, earnestly pleading and drawing sabre, seize this\r\n      Henriot; get the Henriot Gendarmes persuaded not to fight; get\r\n      Robespierre and Company packed into hackney-coaches, sent off\r\n      under escort, to the Luxembourg and other Prisons. This then is\r\n      the end? May not an exhausted Convention adjourn now, for a\r\n      little repose and sustenance, “at five o’clock?”\r\n\r\n      An exhausted Convention did it; and repented it. The end was not\r\n      come; only the end of the _second-act_. Hark, while exhausted\r\n      Representatives sit at victuals,—tocsin bursting from all\r\n      steeples, drums rolling, in the summer evening: Judge Coffinhal\r\n      is galloping with new Gendarmes to deliver Henriot from Tuileries\r\n      Committee-room; and does deliver him! Puissant Henriot vaults on\r\n      horseback; sets to haranguing the Tuileries Gendarmes; corrupts\r\n      the Tuileries Gendarmes too; trots off with them to Townhall.\r\n      Alas, and Robespierre is not in Prison: the Gaoler shewed his\r\n      Municipal order, durst not on pain of his life, admit any\r\n      Prisoner; the Robespierre Hackney-coaches, in confused jangle and\r\n      whirl of uncertain Gendarmes, have floated safe—into the\r\n      Townhall! There sit Robespierre and Company, embraced by\r\n      Municipals and Jacobins, in sacred right of Insurrection;\r\n      redacting Proclamations; sounding tocsins; corresponding with\r\n      Sections and Mother Society. Is not here a pretty enough\r\n      third-act of a _natural_ Greek Drama; catastrophe more uncertain\r\n      than ever?\r\n\r\n      The hasty Convention rushes together again, in the ominous\r\n      nightfall: President Collot, for the chair is his, enters with\r\n      long strides, paleness on his face; claps on his hat; says with\r\n      solemn tone: ‘Citoyens, armed Villains have beset the\r\n      Committee-rooms, and got possession of them. The hour is come, to\r\n      die at our post!’ ‘_Oui_,’ answer one and all: ‘We swear it!’ It\r\n      is no rhodomontade, this time, but a sad fact and necessity;\r\n      unless we _do_ at our posts, we must verily die! Swift therefore,\r\n      Robespierre, Henriot, the Municipality, are declared Rebels; put\r\n      _Hors la Loi_, Out of Law. Better still, we appoint Barras\r\n      Commandant of what Armed-Force is to be had; send Missionary\r\n      Representatives to all Sections and quarters, to preach, and\r\n      raise force; will die at least with harness on our back.\r\n\r\n      What a distracted City; men riding and running, reporting and\r\n      hearsaying; the Hour clearly in travail,—child not to be _named_\r\n      till born! The poor Prisoners in the Luxembourg hear the rumour;\r\n      tremble for a new September. They see men making signals to them,\r\n      on skylights and roofs, apparently signals of hope; cannot in the\r\n      least make out what it is.[755] We observe however, in the\r\n      eventide, as usual, the Death-tumbrils faring South-eastward,\r\n      through Saint-Antoine, towards their Barrier du Trône.\r\n      Saint-Antoine’s tough bowels melt; Saint-Antoine surrounds the\r\n      Tumbrils; says, It shall not be. O Heavens, why should it!\r\n      Henriot and Gendarmes, scouring the streets that way, bellow,\r\n      with waved sabres, that it must. Quit hope, ye poor Doomed! The\r\n      Tumbrils move on.\r\n\r\n      But in this set of Tumbrils there are two other things notable:\r\n      one notable person; and one want of a notable person. The notable\r\n      person is Lieutenant-General Loiserolles, a nobleman by birth,\r\n      and by nature; laying down his life here for his son. In the\r\n      Prison of Saint-Lazare, the night before last, hurrying to the\r\n      Grate to hear the Death-list read, he caught the name of his son.\r\n      The son was asleep at the moment. ‘I am Loiserolles,’ cried the\r\n      old man: at Tinville’s bar, an error in the Christian name is\r\n      little; small objection was made. The want of the notable person,\r\n      again, is that of Deputy Paine! Paine has sat in the Luxembourg\r\n      since January; and seemed forgotten; but Fouquier had pricked him\r\n      at last. The Turnkey, List in hand, is marking with chalk the\r\n      outer doors of tomorrow’s _Fournée_. Paine’s outer door happened\r\n      to be open, turned back on the wall; the Turnkey marked it on the\r\n      side next him, and hurried on: another Turnkey came, and shut it;\r\n      no chalk-mark now visible, the _Fournée_ went without Paine.\r\n      Paine’s life lay not there.—\r\n\r\n      Our fifth-act, of this natural Greek Drama, with its natural\r\n      unities, can only be painted in gross; somewhat as that antique\r\n      Painter, driven desperate, did the _foam._ For through this\r\n      blessed July night, there is clangour, confusion very great, of\r\n      marching troops; of Sections going this way, Sections going that;\r\n      of Missionary Representatives reading Proclamations by\r\n      torchlight; Missionary Legendre, who has raised force somewhere,\r\n      emptying out the Jacobins, and flinging their key on the\r\n      Convention table: ‘I have locked their door; it shall be Virtue\r\n      that re-opens it.’ Paris, we say, is set against itself, rushing\r\n      confused, as Ocean-currents do; a huge Mahlstrom, sounding there,\r\n      under cloud of night. Convention sits permanent on this hand;\r\n      Municipality most permanent on that. The poor Prisoners hear\r\n      tocsin and rumour; strive to bethink them of the signals\r\n      apparently of hope. Meek continual Twilight streaming up, which\r\n      will be Dawn and a Tomorrow, silvers the Northern hem of Night;\r\n      it wends and wends there, that meek brightness, like a silent\r\n      prophecy, along the great Ring-Dial of the Heaven. So still,\r\n      eternal! And on Earth all is confused shadow and conflict;\r\n      dissidence, tumultuous gloom and glare; and Destiny as yet shakes\r\n      her doubtful urn.\r\n\r\n      About three in the morning, the dissident Armed-Forces have\r\n      _met_. Henriot’s Armed Force stood ranked in the Place de Grève;\r\n      and now Barras’s, which he has recruited, arrives there; and they\r\n      front each other, cannon bristling against cannon. Citoyens!\r\n      cries the voice of Discretion, loudly enough, Before coming to\r\n      bloodshed, to endless civil-war, hear the Convention Decree read:\r\n      “Robespierre and all rebels Out of Law!”—Out of Law? There is\r\n      terror in the sound: unarmed Citoyens disperse rapidly home;\r\n      Municipal Cannoneers range themselves on the Convention side,\r\n      with shouting. At which shout, Henriot descends from his upper\r\n      room, far gone in drink as some say; finds his Place de Grève\r\n      empty; the cannons’ mouth turned _towards_ him; and, on the\r\n      whole,—that it is now the catastrophe!\r\n\r\n      Stumbling in again, the wretched drunk-sobered Henriot announces:\r\n      ‘All is lost!’ ‘_Misérable!_ it is thou that hast lost it,’ cry\r\n      they: and fling him, or else he flings himself, out of window:\r\n      far enough down; into masonwork and horror of cesspool; not into\r\n      death but worse. Augustin Robespierre follows him; with the like\r\n      fate. Saint-Just called on Lebas to kill him: who would not.\r\n      Couthon crept under a table; attempting to kill himself; not\r\n      doing it.—On entering that Sanhedrim of Insurrection, we find all\r\n      as good as extinct; undone, ready for seizure. Robespierre was\r\n      sitting on a chair, with pistol shot blown through, not his head,\r\n      but his under jaw; the suicidal hand had failed.[756] With prompt\r\n      zeal, not without trouble, we gather these wretched Conspirators;\r\n      fish up even Henriot and Augustin, bleeding and foul; pack them\r\n      all, rudely enough, into carts; and shall, before sunrise, have\r\n      them safe under lock and key. Amid shoutings and embracings.\r\n\r\n      Robespierre lay in an anteroom of the Convention Hall, while his\r\n      Prison-escort was getting ready; the mangled jaw bound up rudely\r\n      with bloody linen: a spectacle to men. He lies stretched on a\r\n      table, a deal-box his pillow; the sheath of the pistol is still\r\n      clenched convulsively in his hand. Men bully him, insult him: his\r\n      eyes still indicate intelligence; he speaks no word. “He had on\r\n      the sky-blue coat he had got made for the Feast of the _Être\r\n      Suprême_”—O reader, can thy hard heart hold out against that? His\r\n      trousers were nankeen; the stockings had fallen down over the\r\n      ankles. He spake no word more in this world.\r\n\r\n      And so, at six in the morning, a victorious Convention adjourns.\r\n      Report flies over Paris as on golden wings; penetrates the\r\n      Prisons; irradiates the faces of those that were ready to perish:\r\n      turnkeys and _moutons_, fallen from their high estate, look mute\r\n      and blue. It is the 28th day of July, called 10th of Thermidor,\r\n      year 1794.\r\n\r\n      Fouquier had but to identify; his Prisoners being already Out of\r\n      Law. At four in the afternoon, never before were the streets of\r\n      Paris seen so crowded. From the Palais de Justice to the Place de\r\n      la Révolution, for _thither_ again go the Tumbrils this time, it\r\n      is one dense stirring mass; all windows crammed; the very roofs\r\n      and ridge-tiles budding forth human Curiosity, in strange\r\n      gladness. The Death-tumbrils, with their motley Batch of Outlaws,\r\n      some Twenty-three or so, from Maximilien to Mayor Fleuriot and\r\n      Simon the Cordwainer, roll on. All eyes are on Robespierre’s\r\n      Tumbril, where he, his jaw bound in dirty linen, with his\r\n      half-dead Brother, and half-dead Henriot, lie shattered; their\r\n      “seventeen hours” of agony about to end. The Gendarmes point\r\n      their swords at him, to shew the people which is he. A woman\r\n      springs on the Tumbril; clutching the side of it with one hand;\r\n      waving the other Sibyl-like; and exclaims: ‘The death of thee\r\n      gladdens my very heart, _m’enivre de joie;_’ Robespierre opened\r\n      his eyes; ‘_Scélérat_, go down to Hell, with the curses of all\r\n      wives and mothers!’—At the foot of the scaffold, they stretched\r\n      him on the ground till his turn came. Lifted aloft, his eyes\r\n      again opened; caught the bloody axe. Samson wrenched the coat off\r\n      him; wrenched the dirty linen from his jaw: the jaw fell\r\n      powerless, there burst from him a cry;—hideous to hear and see.\r\n      Samson, thou canst not be too quick!\r\n\r\n      Samson’s work done, there burst forth shout on shout of applause.\r\n      Shout, which prolongs itself not only over Paris, but over\r\n      France, but over Europe, and down to this Generation. Deservedly,\r\n      and also undeservedly. O unhappiest Advocate of Arras, wert thou\r\n      worse than other Advocates? Stricter man, according to his\r\n      Formula, to his Credo and his Cant, of probities, benevolences,\r\n      pleasures-of-virtue, and such like, lived not in that age. A man\r\n      fitted, in some luckier settled age, to have become one of those\r\n      incorruptible barren Pattern-Figures, and have had marble-tablets\r\n      and funeral-sermons! His poor landlord, the Cabinetmaker in the\r\n      Rue Saint-Honoré, loved him; his Brother died for him. May God be\r\n      merciful to him, and to us.\r\n\r\n      This is end of the Reign of Terror; new glorious _Revolution_\r\n      named _of Thermidor;_ of Thermidor 9th, year 2; which being\r\n      interpreted into old slave-style means 27th of July, 1794. Terror\r\n      is ended; and death in the Place de la Révolution, were the\r\n      “_Tail_ of Robespierre” once executed; which service Fouquier in\r\n      large Batches is swiftly managing.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BOOK 3.VII.\r\n      VENDÉMIAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.I.\r\n      Decadent.\r\n\r\n      How little did any one suppose that here was the end not of\r\n      Robespierre only, but of the Revolution System itself! Least of\r\n      all did the mutinying Committee-men suppose it; who had mutinied\r\n      with no view whatever except to continue the National\r\n      Regeneration with their own heads on their shoulders. And yet so\r\n      it verily was. The insignificant stone they had struck out, so\r\n      insignificant anywhere else, proved to be the Keystone: the whole\r\n      arch-work and edifice of Sansculottism began to loosen, to crack,\r\n      to yawn; and tumbled, piecemeal, with considerable rapidity,\r\n      plunge after plunge; till the Abyss had swallowed it all, and in\r\n      this upper world Sansculottism was no more.\r\n\r\n      For despicable as Robespierre himself might be, the death of\r\n      Robespierre was a signal at which great multitudes of men, struck\r\n      dumb with terror heretofore, rose out of their hiding places:\r\n      and, as it were, saw one another, how multitudinous they were;\r\n      and began speaking and complaining. They are countable by the\r\n      thousand and the million; who have suffered cruel wrong. Ever\r\n      louder rises the plaint of such a multitude; into a universal\r\n      sound, into a universal continuous peal, of what they call Public\r\n      Opinion. Camille had demanded a “Committee of Mercy,” and could\r\n      not get it; but now the whole nation resolves itself into a\r\n      Committee of Mercy: the Nation has tried Sansculottism, and is\r\n      weary of it. Force of Public Opinion! What King or Convention can\r\n      withstand it? You in vain struggle: the thing that is rejected as\r\n      “calumnious” today must pass as veracious with triumph another\r\n      day: gods and men have declared that Sansculottism cannot be.\r\n      Sansculottism, on that Ninth night of Thermidor suicidally\r\n      “fractured its under jaw;” and lies writhing, never to rise more.\r\n\r\n      Through the next fifteenth months, it is what we may call the\r\n      death-agony of Sansculottism. Sansculottism, Anarchy of the\r\n      Jean-Jacques Evangel, having now got deep enough, is to perish in\r\n      a new singular system of Culottism and Arrangement. For\r\n      Arrangement is indispensable to man; Arrangement, were it\r\n      grounded only on that old primary Evangel of Force, with Sceptre\r\n      in the shape of Hammer. Be there method, be there order, cry all\r\n      men; were it that of the Drill-serjeant! More tolerable is the\r\n      drilled Bayonet-rank, than that undrilled Guillotine,\r\n      incalculable as the wind.—How Sansculottism, writhing in\r\n      death-throes, strove some twice, or even three times, to get on\r\n      its feet again; but fell always, and was flung resupine, the next\r\n      instant; and finally breathed out the life of it, and stirred no\r\n      more: this we are now, from a due distance, with due brevity, to\r\n      glance at; and then—O Reader!—Courage, I see land!\r\n\r\n      Two of the first acts of the Convention, very natural for it\r\n      after this Thermidor, are to be specified here: the first is\r\n      renewal of the Governing Committees. Both _Sûreté Générale_ and\r\n      _Salut Public_, thinned by the Guillotine, need filling up: we\r\n      naturally fill them up with Talliens, Frérons, victorious\r\n      Thermidorian men. Still more to the purpose, we appoint that they\r\n      shall, as Law directs, not in name only but in deed, be renewed\r\n      and changed from period to period; a fourth part of them going\r\n      out monthly. The Convention will no more lie under bondage of\r\n      Committees, under terror of death; but be a free Convention; free\r\n      to follow its own judgment, and the Force of Public Opinion. Not\r\n      less natural is it to enact that Prisoners and Persons under\r\n      Accusation shall have right to demand some “Writ of Accusation,”\r\n      and see clearly what they are accused of. Very natural acts: the\r\n      harbingers of hundreds not less so.\r\n\r\n      For now Fouquier’s trade, shackled by Writ of Accusation, and\r\n      legal proof, is as good as gone; effectual only against\r\n      Robespierre’s Tail. The Prisons give up their Suspects; emit them\r\n      faster and faster. The Committees see themselves besieged with\r\n      Prisoners’ friends; complain that they are hindered in their\r\n      work: it is as with men rushing out of a crowded place; and\r\n      obstructing one another. Turned are the tables: Prisoners pouring\r\n      out in floods; Jailors, _Moutons_ and the Tail of Robespierre\r\n      going now whither they were wont to send!—The Hundred and\r\n      thirty-two Nantese Republicans, whom we saw marching in irons,\r\n      have arrived; shrunk to Ninety-four, the fifth man of them choked\r\n      by the road. They arrive: and suddenly find themselves not\r\n      pleaders for life, but denouncers to death. Their Trial is for\r\n      acquittal, and more. As the voice of a trumpet, their testimony\r\n      sounds far and wide, mere atrocities of a Reign of Terror. For a\r\n      space of nineteen days; with all solemnity and publicity.\r\n      Representative Carrier, Company of Marat; Noyadings, Loire\r\n      Marriages, things done in darkness, come forth into light: clear\r\n      is the voice of these poor resuscitated Nantese; and Journals and\r\n      Speech and universal Committee of Mercy reverberate it loud\r\n      enough, into all ears and hearts. Deputation arrives from Arras;\r\n      denouncing the atrocities of Representative Lebon. A tamed\r\n      Convention loves its own life: yet what help? Representative\r\n      Lebon, Representative Carrier must wend towards the Revolutionary\r\n      Tribunal; struggle and delay as we will, the cry of a Nation\r\n      pursues them louder and louder. Them also Tinville must\r\n      abolish;—if indeed Tinville himself be not abolished.\r\n\r\n      We must note moreover the decrepit condition into which a once\r\n      omnipotent Mother Society has fallen. Legendre flung her keys on\r\n      the Convention table, that Thermidor night; her President was\r\n      guillotined with Robespierre. The once mighty Mother came, some\r\n      time after, with a subdued countenance, begging back her keys:\r\n      the keys were restored her; but the strength could not be\r\n      restored her; the strength had departed forever. Alas, one’s day\r\n      is done. Vain that the Tribune in mid air sounds as of old: to\r\n      the general ear it has become a horror, and even a weariness. By\r\n      and by, Affiliation is prohibited: the mighty Mother sees herself\r\n      suddenly childless; mourns, as so hoarse a Rachel may.\r\n\r\n      The Revolutionary Committees, without Suspects to prey upon,\r\n      perish fast; as it were of famine. In Paris the whole Forty-eight\r\n      of them are reduced to Twelve, their _Forty sous_ are abolished:\r\n      yet a little while, and Revolutionary Committees are no more.\r\n      _Maximum_ will be abolished; let Sansculottism find food where it\r\n      can.[757] Neither is there now any Municipality; any centre at\r\n      the Townhall. Mayor Fleuriot and Company perished; whom we shall\r\n      not be in haste to replace. The Townhall remains in a broken\r\n      submissive state; knows not well what it is growing to; knows\r\n      only that it is grown weak, and must obey. What if we should\r\n      split Paris into, say, a Dozen separate Municipalities; incapable\r\n      of concert! The Sections were thus rendered safe to act with:—or\r\n      indeed might not the Sections themselves be abolished? You had\r\n      then merely your Twelve manageable pacific Townships, without\r\n      centre or subdivision;[758] and sacred right of Insurrection fell\r\n      into abeyance!\r\n\r\n      So much is getting abolished; fleeting swiftly into the Inane.\r\n      For the Press speaks, and the human tongue; Journals, heavy and\r\n      light, in Philippic and Burlesque: a renegade Fréron, a renegade\r\n      Prudhomme, loud they as ever, only the contrary way. And\r\n      _Ci-devants_ show themselves, almost parade themselves;\r\n      resuscitated as from death-sleep; publish what death-pains they\r\n      have had. The very Frogs of the Marsh croak with emphasis. Your\r\n      protesting Seventy-three shall, with a struggle, be emitted out\r\n      of Prison, back to their seats; your Louvets, Isnards,\r\n      Lanjuinais, and wrecks of Girondism, recalled from their\r\n      haylofts, and caves in Switzerland, will resume their place in\r\n      the Convention:[759] natural foes of Terror!\r\n\r\n      Thermidorian Talliens, and mere foes of Terror, rule in this\r\n      Convention, and out of it. The compressed Mountain shrinks silent\r\n      more and more. Moderatism rises louder and louder: not as a\r\n      tempest, with threatenings; say rather, as the rushing of a\r\n      mighty organ-blast, and melodious deafening Force of Public\r\n      Opinion, from the Twenty-five million windpipes of a Nation all\r\n      in Committee of Mercy: which how shall any detached body of\r\n      individuals withstand?\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.II.\r\n      La Cabarus.\r\n\r\n      How, above all, shall a poor National Convention, withstand it?\r\n      In this poor National Convention, broken, bewildered by long\r\n      terror, perturbations, and guillotinement, there is no Pilot,\r\n      there is not now even a Danton, who could undertake to steer you\r\n      anywhither, in such press of weather. The utmost a bewildered\r\n      Convention can do, is to veer, and trim, and try to keep itself\r\n      steady: and rush, undrowned, before the wind. Needless to\r\n      struggle; to fling helm a-lee, and make ’_bout ship!_ A\r\n      bewildered Convention sails not in the teeth of the wind; but is\r\n      rapidly blown round again. So strong is the wind, we say; and so\r\n      changed; blowing fresher and fresher, as from the sweet\r\n      South-West; your devastating North-Easters, and wild\r\n      tornado-gusts of Terror, blown utterly out! All Sansculottic\r\n      things are passing away; all things are becoming Culottic.\r\n\r\n      Do but look at the cut of clothes; that light visible Result,\r\n      significant of a thousand things which are not so visible. In\r\n      winter 1793, men went in red nightcaps; Municipals themselves in\r\n      _sabots;_ the very Citoyennes had to petition against such\r\n      headgear. But now in this winter 1794, where is the red nightcap?\r\n      With the thing beyond the Flood. Your monied Citoyen ponders in\r\n      what elegantest style he shall dress himself: whether he shall\r\n      not even dress himself as the Free Peoples of Antiquity. The more\r\n      adventurous Citoyenne has already done it. Behold her, that\r\n      beautiful adventurous Citoyenne: in costume of the Ancient\r\n      Greeks, such Greek as Painter David could teach; her sweeping\r\n      tresses snooded by glittering antique fillet; bright-eyed tunic\r\n      of the Greek women; her little feet naked, as in Antique Statues,\r\n      with mere sandals, and winding-strings of riband,—defying the\r\n      frost!\r\n\r\n      There is such an effervescence of Luxury. For your Emigrant\r\n      _Ci-devants_ carried not their mansions and furnitures out of the\r\n      country with them; but left them standing here: and in the swift\r\n      changes of property, what with money coined on the Place de la\r\n      Révolution, what with Army-furnishings, sales of Emigrant Domain\r\n      and Church Lands and King’s Lands, and then with the\r\n      Aladdin’s-lamp of Agio in a time of Paper-money, such mansions\r\n      have found new occupants. Old wine, drawn from _Ci-devant_\r\n      bottles, descends new throats. Paris has swept herself, relighted\r\n      herself; Salons, Soupers not Fraternal, beam once more with\r\n      suitable effulgence, very singular in colour. The fair Cabarus is\r\n      come out of Prison; wedded to her red-gloomy Dis, whom they say\r\n      she treats too loftily: fair Cabarus gives the most brilliant\r\n      soirées. Round her is gathered a new Republican Army, of\r\n      Citoyennes in sandals; _Ci-devants_ or other: what remnants\r\n      soever of the old grace survive, are rallied there. At her\r\n      right-hand, in this cause, labours fair Josephine the Widow\r\n      Beauharnais, though in straitened circumstances: intent, both of\r\n      them, to blandish down the grimness of Republican austerity, and\r\n      recivilise mankind.\r\n\r\n      Recivilise, as of old they were civilised: by witchery of the\r\n      Orphic fiddle-bow, and Euterpean rhythm; by the Graces, by the\r\n      Smiles! Thermidorian Deputies are there in those soirées; Editor\r\n      Fréron, _Orateur du Peuple;_ Barras, who has known other dances\r\n      than the Carmagnole. Grim Generals of the Republic are there; in\r\n      enormous horse-collar neckcloth, good against sabre-cuts; the\r\n      hair gathered all into one knot, “flowing down behind, fixed with\r\n      a comb.” Among which latter do we not recognise, once more, the\r\n      little bronzed-complexioned Artillery-Officer of Toulon, home\r\n      from the Italian Wars! Grim enough; of lean, almost cruel aspect:\r\n      for he has been in trouble, in ill health; also in ill favour, as\r\n      a man promoted, deservingly or not, by the Terrorists and\r\n      Robespierre Junior. But does not Barras know him? Will not Barras\r\n      speak a word for him? Yes,—if at any time it will serve Barras so\r\n      to do. Somewhat forlorn of fortune, for the present, stands that\r\n      Artillery-Officer; looks, with those deep earnest eyes of his,\r\n      into a future as waste as the most. Taciturn; yet with the\r\n      strangest utterances in him, if you awaken him, which smite home,\r\n      like light or lightning:—on the whole, rather dangerous? A\r\n      “dissociable” man? Dissociable enough; a natural terror and\r\n      horror to all Phantasms, being himself of the genus Reality! He\r\n      stands here, without work or outlook, in this forsaken\r\n      manner;—glances nevertheless, it would seem, at the kind glance\r\n      of Josephine Beauharnais; and, for the rest, with severe\r\n      countenance, with open eyes and closed lips, waits what will\r\n      betide.\r\n\r\n      That the Balls, therefore, have a new figure this winter, we can\r\n      see. Not Carmagnoles, rude “whirlblasts of rags,” as Mercier\r\n      called them “precursors of storm and destruction:” no, soft Ionic\r\n      motions; fit for the light sandal, and antique Grecian tunic!\r\n      Efflorescence of Luxury has come out: for men have wealth; nay\r\n      new-got wealth; and under the Terror you durst not dance except\r\n      in rags. Among the innumerable kinds of Balls, let the hasty\r\n      reader mark only this single one: the kind they call Victim\r\n      Balls, _Bals à Victime_. The dancers, in choice costume, have all\r\n      crape round the left arm: to be admitted, it needs that you be a\r\n      _Victime;_ that you have lost a relative under the Terror. Peace\r\n      to the Dead; let us _dance_ to their memory! For in all ways one\r\n      must dance.\r\n\r\n      It is very remarkable, according to Mercier, under what varieties\r\n      of figure this great business of dancing goes on. “The women,”\r\n      says he, “are Nymphs, Sultanas; sometimes Minervas, Junos, even\r\n      Dianas. In light-unerring gyrations they swim there; with such\r\n      earnestness of purpose; with perfect silence, so absorbed are\r\n      they. What is singular,” continues he, “the onlookers are as it\r\n      were mingled with the dancers; form as it were a circumambient\r\n      element round the different contre-dances, yet without deranging\r\n      them. It is rare, in fact, that a Sultana in such circumstances\r\n      experience the smallest collision. Her pretty foot darts down, an\r\n      inch from mine; she is off again; she is as a flash of light: but\r\n      soon the measure recalls her to the point she set out from. Like\r\n      a glittering comet she travels her eclipse, revolving on herself,\r\n      as by a double effect of gravitation and attraction.”[760]\r\n      Looking forward a little way, into Time, the same Mercier\r\n      discerns _Merveilleuses_ in “flesh-coloured drawers” with gold\r\n      circlets; mere dancing Houris of an artificial\r\n      Mahomet’s-Paradise: much too Mahometan. Montgaillard, with his\r\n      splenetic eye, notes a no less strange thing; that every\r\n      fashionable Citoyenne you meet is in an interesting situation.\r\n      Good Heavens, _every?_ Mere pillows and stuffing! adds the acrid\r\n      man;—such, in a time of depopulation by war and guillotine, being\r\n      the fashion.[761] No further seek its merits to disclose.\r\n\r\n      Behold also instead of the old grim _Tappe-durs_ of Robespierre,\r\n      what new street-groups are these? Young men habited not in\r\n      black-shag Carmagnole spencer, but in superfine _habit carré_ or\r\n      spencer with rectangular tail appended to it; “square-tailed\r\n      coat,” with elegant antiguillotinish specialty of collar; “the\r\n      hair plaited at the temples,” and knotted back, long-flowing, in\r\n      military wise: young men of what they call the _Muscadin_ or\r\n      Dandy species! Fréron, in his fondness names them _Jeunesse\r\n      Dorée_, Golden, or Gilt Youth. They have come out, these Gilt\r\n      Youths, in a kind of resuscitated state; they wear crape round\r\n      the left arm, such of them as were _Victims_. More they carry\r\n      clubs loaded with lead; in an angry manner: any _Tappe-dur_ or\r\n      remnant of Jacobinism they may fall in with, shall fare the\r\n      worse. They have suffered much: their friends guillotined; their\r\n      pleasures, frolics, superfine collars ruthlessly repressed: “ware\r\n      now the base Red Nightcaps who did it! Fair Cabarus and the Army\r\n      of Greek sandals smile approval. In the Théâtre Feydeau, young\r\n      Valour in square-tailed coat eyes Beauty in Greek sandals, and\r\n      kindles by her glances: Down with Jacobinism! No Jacobin hymn or\r\n      demonstration, only Thermidorian ones, shall be permitted here:\r\n      we beat down Jacobinism with clubs loaded with lead.\r\n\r\n      But let any one who has examined the Dandy nature, how petulant\r\n      it is, especially in the gregarious state, think what an element,\r\n      in sacred right of insurrection, this Gilt Youth was! Broils and\r\n      battery; war without truce or measure! Hateful is Sansculottism,\r\n      as Death and Night. For indeed is not the Dandy _culottic_,\r\n      habilatory, by law of existence; “a cloth-animal: one that lives,\r\n      moves, and has his being in cloth?”—\r\n\r\n      So goes it, waltzing, bickering; fair Cabarus, by Orphic\r\n      witchery, struggling to recivilise mankind. Not unsuccessfully,\r\n      we hear. What utmost Republican grimness can resist Greek\r\n      sandals, in Ionic motion, the very toes covered with gold\r\n      rings?[762] By degrees the indisputablest new-politeness rises;\r\n      grows, with vigour. And yet, whether, even to this day, that\r\n      inexpressible tone of society known under the old Kings, when Sin\r\n      had “lost all its deformity” (with or without advantage to us),\r\n      and airy Nothing had obtained such a local habitation and\r\n      establishment as she never had,—be recovered? Or even, whether it\r\n      be not lost beyond recovery?[763]—Either way, the world must\r\n      contrive to struggle on.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.III.\r\n      Quiberon.\r\n\r\n      But indeed do not these long-flowing hair-queues of a _Jeunesse\r\n      Dorée_ in semi-military costume betoken, unconsciously, another\r\n      still more important tendency? The Republic, abhorrent of her\r\n      Guillotine, loves her Army.\r\n\r\n      And with cause. For, surely, if good fighting be a kind of\r\n      honour, as it is, in its season; and be with the vulgar of men,\r\n      even the chief kind of honour, then here is good fighting, in\r\n      good season, if there ever was. These Sons of the Republic, they\r\n      rose, in mad wrath, to deliver her from Slavery and Cimmeria. And\r\n      have they not done it? Through Maritime Alps, through gorges of\r\n      Pyrenees, through Low Countries, Northward along the\r\n      Rhine-valley, far is Cimmeria hurled back from the sacred\r\n      Motherland. Fierce as fire, they have carried her Tricolor over\r\n      the faces of all her enemies;—over scarped heights, over\r\n      cannon-batteries; down, as with the Vengeur, into the dead deep\r\n      sea. She has “Eleven hundred thousand fighters on foot,” this\r\n      Republic: “At one particular moment she had,” or supposed she\r\n      had, “seventeen hundred thousand.”[764] Like a ring of lightning,\r\n      they, volleying and _ça-ira_-ing, begirdle her from shore to\r\n      shore. Cimmerian Coalition of Despots recoils; smitten with\r\n      astonishment, and strange pangs.\r\n\r\n      Such a fire is in these Gaelic Republican men; high-blazing;\r\n      which no Coalition can withstand! Not scutcheons, with four\r\n      degrees of nobility; but _ci-devant_ Sergeants, who have had to\r\n      clutch Generalship out of the cannon’s throat, a Pichegru, a\r\n      Jourdan, a Hoche, lead them on. They have bread, they have iron;\r\n      “with bread and iron you can get to China.”—See Pichegru’s\r\n      soldiers, this hard winter, in their looped and windowed\r\n      destitution, in their “straw-rope shoes and cloaks of bass-mat,”\r\n      how they overrun Holland, like a demon-host, the ice having\r\n      bridged all waters; and rush shouting from victory to victory!\r\n      Ships in the Texel are taken by huzzars on horseback: fled is\r\n      York; fled is the Stadtholder, glad to escape to England, and\r\n      leave Holland to fraternise.[765] Such a Gaelic fire, we say,\r\n      blazes in this People, like the conflagration of grass and\r\n      dry-jungle; which no mortal can withstand—for the moment.\r\n\r\n      And even so it will blaze and run, scorching all things; and,\r\n      from Cadiz to Archangel, mad Sansculottism, drilled now into\r\n      Soldiership, led on by some “armed Soldier of Democracy” (say,\r\n      that Monosyllabic Artillery-Officer), will set its foot cruelly\r\n      on the necks of its enemies; and its shouting and their shrieking\r\n      shall fill the world!—Rash Coalised Kings, such a fire have ye\r\n      kindled; yourselves fireless, _your_ fighters animated only by\r\n      drill-serjeants, messroom moralities, and the drummer’s cat!\r\n      However, it is begun, and will not end: not for a matter of\r\n      twenty years. So long, this Gaelic fire, through its successive\r\n      changes of colour and character, will blaze over the face of\r\n      Europe, and afflict the scorch all men:—till it provoke all men;\r\n      till it kindle another kind of fire, the Teutonic kind, namely;\r\n      and be swallowed up, so to speak, in a day! For there is a fire\r\n      comparable to the burning of dry-jungle and grass; most sudden,\r\n      high-blazing: and another fire which we liken to the burning of\r\n      coal, or even of anthracite coal; difficult to kindle, but then\r\n      which nothing will put out. The ready Gaelic fire, we can remark\r\n      further, and remark not in Pichegrus only, but in innumerable\r\n      Voltaires, Racines, Laplaces, no less; for a man, whether he\r\n      fight, or sing, or think, will remain the same unity of a man,—is\r\n      admirable for roasting eggs, in every conceivable sense. The\r\n      Teutonic anthracite again, as we see in Luthers, Leibnitzes,\r\n      Shakespeares, is preferable for smelting metals. How happy is our\r\n      Europe that has both kinds!—\r\n\r\n      But be this as it may, the Republic is clearly triumphing. In the\r\n      spring of the year Mentz Town again sees itself besieged; will\r\n      again change master: did not Merlin the Thionviller, “with wild\r\n      beard and look,” say it was not for the last time they saw him\r\n      there? The Elector of Mentz circulates among his brother\r\n      Potentates this pertinent query, Were it not advisable to treat\r\n      of Peace? Yes! answers many an Elector from the bottom of his\r\n      heart. But, on the other hand, Austria hesitates; finally\r\n      refuses, being subsidied by Pitt. As to Pitt, whoever hesitate,\r\n      he, suspending his Habeas-corpus, suspending his Cash-payments,\r\n      stands inflexible,—spite of foreign reverses; spite of domestic\r\n      obstacles, of Scotch National Conventions and English Friends of\r\n      the People, whom he is obliged to arraign, to hang, or even to\r\n      see acquitted with jubilee: a lean inflexible man. The Majesty of\r\n      Spain, as we predicted, makes Peace; also the Majesty of Prussia:\r\n      and there is a Treaty of Bâle.[766] Treaty with black Anarchists\r\n      and Regicides! Alas, what help? You cannot hang this Anarchy; it\r\n      is like to hang you: you must needs treat with it.\r\n\r\n      Likewise, General Hoche has even succeeded in pacificating La\r\n      Vendée. Rogue Rossignol and his “Infernal Columns” have vanished:\r\n      by firmness and justice, by sagacity and industry, General Hoche\r\n      has done it. Taking “Movable Columns,” not infernal; girdling-in\r\n      the Country; pardoning the submissive, cutting down the\r\n      resistive, limb after limb of the Revolt is brought under. La\r\n      Rochejacquelin, last of our Nobles, fell in battle; Stofflet\r\n      himself makes terms; Georges-Cadoudal is back to Brittany, among\r\n      his Chouans: the frightful gangrene of La Vendée seems veritably\r\n      extirpated. It has cost, as they reckon in round numbers, the\r\n      lives of a Hundred Thousand fellow-mortals; with noyadings,\r\n      conflagratings by infernal column, which defy arithmetic. This is\r\n      the La Vendée War.[767]\r\n\r\n      Nay in few months, it does burst up once more, but once\r\n      only:—blown upon by Pitt, by our Ci-devant Puisaye of Calvados,\r\n      and others. In the month of July 1795, English Ships will ride in\r\n      Quiberon roads. There will be debarkation of chivalrous\r\n      Ci-devants, of volunteer Prisoners-of-war—eager to desert; of\r\n      fire-arms, Proclamations, clothes-chests, Royalists and specie.\r\n      Whereupon also, on the Republican side, there will be rapid\r\n      stand-to-arms; with ambuscade marchings by Quiberon beach, at\r\n      midnight; storming of Fort Penthievre; war-thunder mingling with\r\n      the roar of the nightly main; and such a morning light as has\r\n      seldom dawned; debarkation hurled back into its boats, or into\r\n      the devouring billows, with wreck and wail;—in one word, a\r\n      Ci-devant Puisaye as totally ineffectual here as he was in\r\n      Calvados, when he rode from Vernon Castle without boots.[768]\r\n\r\n      Again, therefore, it has cost the lives of many a brave man.\r\n      Among whom the whole world laments the brave Son of Sombreuil.\r\n      Ill-fated family! The father and younger son went to the\r\n      guillotine; the heroic daughter languishes, reduced to want,\r\n      hides her woes from History: the elder son perishes here; shot by\r\n      military tribunal as an Emigrant; Hoche himself cannot save him.\r\n      If all wars, civil and other, are misunderstandings, what a thing\r\n      must right-understanding be!\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.IV.\r\n      Lion not Dead.\r\n\r\n      The Convention, borne on the tide of Fortune towards foreign\r\n      Victory, and driven by the strong wind of Public Opinion towards\r\n      Clemency and Luxury, is rushing fast; all skill of pilotage is\r\n      needed, and more than all, in such a velocity.\r\n\r\n      Curious to see, how we veer and whirl, yet must ever whirl round\r\n      again, and scud before the wind. If, on the one hand, we re-admit\r\n      the Protesting Seventy-Three, we, on the other hand, agree to\r\n      consummate the Apotheosis of Marat; lift his body from the\r\n      Cordeliers Church, and transport it to the Pantheon of Great\r\n      Men,—flinging out Mirabeau to make room for him. To no purpose:\r\n      so strong blows Public Opinion! A Gilt Youthhood, in plaited\r\n      hair-tresses, tears down his Busts from the Theatre Feydeau;\r\n      tramples them under foot; scatters them, with vociferation into\r\n      the Cesspool of Montmartre.[769] Swept is his Chapel from the\r\n      Place du Carrousel; the Cesspool of Montmartre will receive his\r\n      very dust. Shorter godhood had no divine man. Some four months in\r\n      this Pantheon, Temple of All the Immortals; then to the Cesspool,\r\n      grand _Cloaca_ of Paris and the World! “His Busts at one time\r\n      amounted to four thousand.” Between Temple of All the Immortals\r\n      and Cloaca of the World, how are poor human creatures whirled!\r\n\r\n      Furthermore the question arises, When will the Constitution of\r\n      _Ninety-three_, of 1793, come into action? Considerate heads\r\n      surmise, in all privacy, that the Constitution of Ninety-three\r\n      will never come into action. Let them busy themselves to get\r\n      ready a better.\r\n\r\n      Or, again, where now are the Jacobins? Childless, most decrepit,\r\n      as we saw, sat the mighty Mother; gnashing not teeth, but empty\r\n      gums, against a traitorous Thermidorian Convention and the\r\n      current of things. Twice were Billaud, Collot and Company accused\r\n      in Convention, by a Lecointre, by a Legendre; and the second\r\n      time, it was not voted calumnious. Billaud from the Jacobin\r\n      tribune says, ‘The lion is not dead, he is only sleeping.’ They\r\n      ask him in Convention, What he means by the awakening of the\r\n      lion? And bickerings, of an extensive sort, arose in the\r\n      Palais-Egalité between _Tappe-durs_ and the Gilt Youthhood; cries\r\n      of ‘Down with the Jacobins, the _Jacoquins_,’ _coquin_ meaning\r\n      scoundrel! The Tribune in mid-air gave battle-sound; answered\r\n      only by silence and uncertain gasps. Talk was, in Government\r\n      Committees, of “suspending” the Jacobin Sessions. Hark, there!—it\r\n      is in Allhallow-time, or on the Hallow-eve itself, month\r\n      _ci-devant_ November, year once named of Grace 1794, sad eve for\r\n      Jacobinism,—volley of stones dashing through our windows, with\r\n      jingle and execration! The female Jacobins, famed _Tricoteuses_\r\n      with knitting-needles, take flight; are met at the doors by a\r\n      Gilt Youthhood and “mob of four thousand persons;” are hooted,\r\n      flouted, hustled; fustigated, in a scandalous manner, _cotillons\r\n      retroussés;_—and vanish in mere hysterics. Sally out ye male\r\n      Jacobins! The male Jacobins sally out; but only to battle,\r\n      disaster and confusion. So that armed Authority has to intervene:\r\n      and again on the morrow to intervene; and suspend the Jacobin\r\n      Sessions forever and a day.[770] Gone are the Jacobins; into\r\n      invisibility; in a storm of laughter and howls. Their place is\r\n      made a Normal School, the first of the kind seen; it then\r\n      vanishes into a “Market of Thermidor Ninth;” into a Market of\r\n      Saint-Honoré, where is now peaceable chaffering for poultry and\r\n      greens. The solemn temples, the great globe itself; the baseless\r\n      fabric! Are not we such stuff, we and this world of ours, as\r\n      Dreams are made of?\r\n\r\n      Maximum being abrogated, Trade was to take its own free course.\r\n      Alas, Trade, shackled, topsyturvied in the way we saw, and now\r\n      suddenly let go again, can for the present take no course at all;\r\n      but only reel and stagger. There is, so to speak, no Trade\r\n      whatever for the time being. Assignats, long sinking, emitted in\r\n      such quantities, sink now with an alacrity beyond parallel.\r\n      ‘_Combien?_’ said one, to a Hackney-coachman, ‘What fare?’ ‘Six\r\n      thousand livres,’ answered he: some three hundred pounds\r\n      sterling, in Paper-money.[771] Pressure of Maximum withdrawn, the\r\n      things it compressed likewise withdraw. “Two ounces of bread per\r\n      day” in the modicum allotted: wide-waving, doleful are the\r\n      Bakers’ Queues; Farmers’ houses are become pawnbrokers’ shops.\r\n\r\n      One can imagine, in these circumstances, with what humour\r\n      Sansculottism growled in its throat, ‘_La Cabarus;_’ beheld\r\n      Ci-devants return dancing, the Thermidor effulgence of\r\n      recivilisation, and Balls in flesh-coloured drawers. Greek tunics\r\n      and sandals; hosts of _Muscadins_ parading, with their clubs\r\n      loaded with lead;—and we here, cast out, abhorred, “picking\r\n      offals from the street;”[772] agitating in Baker’s Queue for our\r\n      two ounces of bread! Will the Jacobin lion, which they say is\r\n      meeting secretly “at the Archevêché, in _bonnet rouge_ with\r\n      loaded pistols,” not awaken? Seemingly not. Our Collot, our\r\n      Billaud, Barrère, Vadier, in these last days of March 1795, are\r\n      found worthy of _Déportation_, of Banishment beyond seas; and\r\n      shall, for the present, be trundled off to the Castle of Ham. The\r\n      lion is dead;—or writhing in death-throes!\r\n\r\n      Behold, accordingly, on the day they call Twelfth of Germinal\r\n      (which is also called First of April, not a lucky day), how\r\n      lively are these streets of Paris once more! Floods of hungry\r\n      women, of squalid hungry men; ejaculating: ‘Bread, Bread and the\r\n      Constitution of Ninety-three!’ Paris has risen, once again, like\r\n      the Ocean-tide; is flowing towards the Tuileries, for Bread and a\r\n      Constitution. Tuileries Sentries do their best; but it serves\r\n      not: the Ocean-tide sweeps them away; inundates the Convention\r\n      Hall itself; howling, ‘Bread, and the Constitution!’\r\n\r\n      Unhappy Senators, unhappy People, there is yet, after all toils\r\n      and broils, no Bread, no Constitution. ‘_Du pain, pas tant de\r\n      longs discours_, Bread, not bursts of Parliamentary eloquence!’\r\n      so wailed the Menads of Maillard, five years ago and more; so\r\n      wail ye to this hour. The Convention, with unalterable\r\n      countenance, with what thought one knows not, keeps its seat in\r\n      this waste howling chaos; rings its stormbell from the Pavilion\r\n      of Unity. Section Lepelletier, old _Filles Saint-Thomas_, who are\r\n      of the money-changing species; these and Gilt Youthhood fly to\r\n      the rescue; sweep chaos forth again, with levelled bayonets.\r\n      Paris is declared “in a state of siege.” Pichegru, Conqueror of\r\n      Holland, who happens to be here, is named Commandant, till the\r\n      disturbance end. He, in one day, so to speak, ends it. He\r\n      accomplishes the transfer of Billaud, Collot and Company;\r\n      dissipating all opposition “by two cannon-shots,” blank\r\n      cannon-shots, and the terror of his name; and thereupon\r\n      announcing, with a Laconicism which should be imitated,\r\n      ‘Representatives, your decrees are executed,’[773] lays down his\r\n      Commandantship.\r\n\r\n      This Revolt of Germinal, therefore, has passed, like a vain cry.\r\n      The Prisoners rest safe in Ham, waiting for ships; some nine\r\n      hundred “chief Terrorists of Paris” are disarmed. Sansculottism,\r\n      swept forth with bayonets, has vanished, with its misery, to the\r\n      bottom of Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau.—Time was when Usher\r\n      Maillard with Menads could alter the course of Legislation; but\r\n      that time is not. Legislation seems to have got bayonets; Section\r\n      Lepelletier takes its firelock, not for us! We retire to our dark\r\n      dens; our cry of hunger is called a Plot of Pitt; the Saloons\r\n      glitter, the flesh-coloured Drawers gyrate as before. It was for\r\n      ‘_The Cabarus_’ then, and her _Muscadins_ and Money-changers,\r\n      that we fought? It was for Balls in flesh-coloured drawers that\r\n      we took Feudalism by the beard, and did, and dared, shedding our\r\n      blood like water? Expressive Silence, muse thou their praise!—\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.V.\r\n      Lion Sprawling its Last.\r\n\r\n      Representative Carrier went to the Guillotine, in December last;\r\n      protesting that he acted by orders. The Revolutionary Tribunal,\r\n      after all it has devoured, has now only, as Anarchic things do,\r\n      to devour itself. In the early days of May, men see a remarkable\r\n      thing: Fouquier-Tinville pleading at the Bar once his own. He and\r\n      his chief Jurymen, Leroi _August-Tenth_, Juryman Vilate, a Batch\r\n      of Sixteen; pleading hard, protesting that they acted by orders:\r\n      but pleading in vain. Thus men break the axe with which they have\r\n      done hateful things; the axe itself having grown hateful. For the\r\n      rest, Fouquier died hard enough: ‘Where are thy Batches?’ howled\r\n      the People.—‘Hungry _canaille_,’ asked Fouquier, ‘is thy Bread\r\n      cheaper, wanting them?’\r\n\r\n      Remarkable Fouquier; once but as other Attorneys and Law-beagles,\r\n      which hunt ravenous on this Earth, a well-known phasis of human\r\n      nature; and now thou art and remainest the most remarkable\r\n      Attorney that ever lived and hunted in the Upper Air! For, in\r\n      this terrestrial Course of Time, there was to be an _Avatar_ of\r\n      Attorneyism; the Heavens had said, Let there be an Incarnation,\r\n      not divine, of the venatory Attorney-spirit which keeps its eye\r\n      on the bond only;—and lo, this was it; and they have attorneyed\r\n      it in its turn. Vanish, then, thou rat-eyed Incarnation of\r\n      Attorneyism; who at bottom wert but as other Attorneys, and too\r\n      hungry Sons of Adam! Juryman Vilate had striven hard for life,\r\n      and published, from his Prison, an ingenious Book, not unknown to\r\n      us; but it would not stead: he also had to vanish; and this his\r\n      Book of the _Secret Causes of Thermidor_, full of lies, with\r\n      particles of truth in it undiscoverable otherwise, is all that\r\n      remains of him.\r\n\r\n      Revolutionary Tribunal has done; but vengeance has not done.\r\n      Representative Lebon, after long struggling, is handed over to\r\n      the ordinary Law Courts, and by them guillotined. Nay, at Lyons\r\n      and elsewhere, resuscitated Moderatism, in its vengeance, will\r\n      not wait the slow process of Law; but bursts into the Prisons,\r\n      sets fire to the prisons; burns some three score imprisoned\r\n      Jacobins to dire death, or chokes them “with the smoke of straw.”\r\n      There go vengeful truculent “Companies of Jesus,” “Companies of\r\n      the Sun;” slaying Jacobinism wherever they meet with it; flinging\r\n      it into the Rhone-stream; which, once more, bears seaward a\r\n      horrid cargo.[774] Whereupon, at Toulon, Jacobinism rises in\r\n      revolt; and is like to hang the National Representatives.—With\r\n      such action and reaction, is not a poor National Convention hard\r\n      bested? It is like the settlement of winds and waters, of seas\r\n      long tornado-beaten; and goes on with jumble and with jangle. Now\r\n      flung aloft, now sunk in trough of the sea, your Vessel of the\r\n      Republic has need of all pilotage and more.\r\n\r\n      What Parliament that ever sat under the Moon had such a series of\r\n      destinies, as this National Convention of France? It came\r\n      together to make the Constitution; and instead of that, it has\r\n      had to make nothing but destruction and confusion: to burn up\r\n      Catholicisms, Aristocratisms, to worship Reason and dig\r\n      Saltpetre, to fight Titanically with itself and with the whole\r\n      world. A Convention decimated by the Guillotine; above the tenth\r\n      man has bowed his neck to the axe. Which has seen Carmagnoles\r\n      danced before it, and patriotic strophes sung amid Church-spoils;\r\n      the wounded of the Tenth of August defile in handbarrows; and, in\r\n      the Pandemonial Midnight, Egalité’s dames in tricolor drink\r\n      lemonade, and spectrum of Sieyes mount, saying, _Death sans\r\n      phrase_. A Convention which has effervesced, and which has\r\n      congealed; which has been red with rage, and also pale with rage:\r\n      sitting with pistols in its pocket, drawing sword (in a moment of\r\n      effervescence): now storming to the four winds, through a\r\n      Danton-voice, Awake, O France, and smite the tyrants; now frozen\r\n      mute under its Robespierre, and answering his dirge-voice by a\r\n      dubious gasp. Assassinated, decimated; stabbed at, shot at, in\r\n      baths, on streets and staircases; which has been the nucleus of\r\n      Chaos. Has it not heard the chimes at midnight? It has\r\n      deliberated, beset by a Hundred thousand armed men with\r\n      artillery-furnaces and provision-carts. It has been betocsined,\r\n      bestormed; over-flooded by black deluges of Sansculottism; and\r\n      has heard the shrill cry, _Bread and Soap_. For, as we say, its\r\n      the nucleus of Chaos; it sat as the centre of Sansculottism; and\r\n      had spread its pavilion on the waste Deep, where is neither path\r\n      nor landmark, neither bottom nor shore. In intrinsic valour,\r\n      ingenuity, fidelity, and general force and manhood, it has\r\n      perhaps not far surpassed the average of Parliaments: but in\r\n      frankness of purpose, in singularity of position, it seeks its\r\n      fellow. One other Sansculottic submersion, or at most two, and\r\n      this wearied vessel of a Convention reaches land.\r\n\r\n      Revolt of Germinal Twelfth ended as a vain cry; moribund\r\n      Sansculottism was swept back into invisibility. There it has lain\r\n      moaning, these six weeks: moaning, and also scheming. Jacobins\r\n      disarmed, flung forth from their Tribune in mid air, must needs\r\n      try to help themselves, in secret conclave under ground. Lo,\r\n      therefore, on the First day of the month _Prairial_, 20th of May\r\n      1795, sound of the _générale_ once more; beating sharp, ran-tan,\r\n      To arms, To arms!\r\n\r\n      Sansculottism has risen, yet again, from its death-lair; waste\r\n      wild-flowing, as the unfruitful Sea. Saint-Antoine is a-foot:\r\n      ‘Bread and the Constitution of Ninety-three,’ so sounds it; so\r\n      stands it written with chalk on the hats of men. They have their\r\n      pikes, their firelocks; Paper of Grievances; standards; printed\r\n      Proclamation, drawn up in quite official manner,—considering\r\n      this, and also considering that, they, a much-enduring Sovereign\r\n      People, are in Insurrection; will have Bread and the Constitution\r\n      of Ninety-three. And so the Barriers are seized, and the\r\n      _générale_ beats, and tocsins discourse discord. Black deluges\r\n      overflow the Tuileries; spite of sentries, the Sanctuary itself\r\n      is invaded: enter, to our Order of the Day, a torrent of\r\n      dishevelled women, wailing, ‘Bread! Bread!’ President may well\r\n      cover himself; and have his own tocsin rung in “the Pavilion of\r\n      Unity;” the ship of the State again labours and leaks;\r\n      overwashed, near to swamping, with unfruitful brine.\r\n\r\n      What a day, once more! Women are driven out: men storm\r\n      irresistibly in; choke all corridors, thunder at all gates.\r\n      Deputies, putting forth head, obtest, conjure; Saint-Antoine\r\n      rages, ‘Bread and Constitution.’ Report has risen that the\r\n      “Convention is assassinating the women:” crushing and rushing,\r\n      clangor and furor! The oak doors have become as oak tambourines,\r\n      sounding under the axe of Saint-Antoine; plaster-work crackles,\r\n      woodwork booms and jingles; door starts up;—bursts-in\r\n      Saint-Antoine with frenzy and vociferation, Rag-standards,\r\n      printed Proclamation, drum-music: astonishment to eye and ear.\r\n      Gendarmes, loyal Sectioners charge through the other door; they\r\n      are recharged; musketry exploding: Saint-Antoine cannot be\r\n      expelled. Obtesting Deputies obtest vainly; Respect the\r\n      President; approach not the President! Deputy Féraud, stretching\r\n      out his hands, baring his bosom scarred in the Spanish wars,\r\n      obtests vainly: threatens and resists vainly. Rebellious Deputy\r\n      of the Sovereign, if thou have fought, have not we too? We have\r\n      no bread, no Constitution! They wrench poor Féraud; they tumble\r\n      him, trample him, wrath waxing to see itself work: they drag him\r\n      into the corridor, dead or near it; sever his head, and fix it on\r\n      a pike. Ah, did an unexampled Convention want this variety of\r\n      destiny too, then? Féraud’s bloody head goes on a pike. Such a\r\n      game has begun; Paris and the Earth may wait how it will end.\r\n\r\n      And so it billows free though all Corridors; within, and without,\r\n      far as the eye reaches, nothing but Bedlam, and the great Deep\r\n      broken loose! President Boissy d’Anglas sits like a rock: the\r\n      rest of the Convention is floated “to the upper benches;”\r\n      Sectioners and Gendarmes still ranking there to form a kind of\r\n      wall for them. And Insurrection rages; rolls its drums; will read\r\n      its Paper of Grievances, will have this decreed, will have that.\r\n      Covered sits President Boissy, unyielding; like a rock in the\r\n      beating of seas. They menace him, level muskets at him, he yields\r\n      not; they hold up Féraud’s bloody head to him, with grave stern\r\n      air he bows to it, and yields not.\r\n\r\n      And the Paper of Grievances cannot get itself read for uproar;\r\n      and the drums roll, and the throats bawl; and Insurrection, like\r\n      sphere-music, is inaudible for very noise: Decree us this, Decree\r\n      us that. One man we discern bawling “for the space of an hour at\r\n      all intervals,” ‘_Je demande l’arrestation des coquins et des\r\n      lâches_.’ Really one of the most comprehensive Petitions ever put\r\n      up: which indeed, to this hour, includes all that you can\r\n      reasonably ask Constitution of the Year One, Rotten-Borough,\r\n      Ballot-Box, or other miraculous Political Ark of the Covenant to\r\n      do for you to the end of the world! I also _demand arrestment of\r\n      the Knaves and Dastards_, and nothing more whatever. National\r\n      Representation, deluged with black Sansculottism glides out; for\r\n      help elsewhere, for safety elsewhere: here is no help.\r\n\r\n      About four in the afternoon, there remain hardly more than some\r\n      Sixty Members: mere friends, or even secret-leaders; a remnant of\r\n      the Mountain-crest, held in silence by Thermidorian thraldom. Now\r\n      is the time for them; now or never let them descend, and speak!\r\n      They descend, these Sixty, invited by Sansculottism: Romme of the\r\n      New Calendar, Ruhl of the Sacred Phial, Goujon, Duquesnoy,\r\n      Soubrany, and the rest. Glad Sansculottism forms a ring for them;\r\n      Romme takes the President’s chair; they begin resolving and\r\n      decreeing. Fast enough now comes Decree after Decree, in\r\n      alternate brief strains, or strophe and antistrophe,—what will\r\n      cheapen bread, what will awaken the dormant lion. And at every\r\n      new Decree, Sansculottism shouts, Decreed, Decreed; and rolls its\r\n      drums.\r\n\r\n      Fast enough; the work of months in hours,—when see, a Figure\r\n      enters, whom in the lamp-light we recognise to be Legendre; and\r\n      utters words: fit to be hissed out! And then see, Section\r\n      Lepelletier or other Muscadin Section enters, and Gilt Youth,\r\n      with levelled bayonets, countenances screwed to the\r\n      sticking-place! Tramp, tramp, with bayonets gleaming in the\r\n      lamp-light: what can one do, worn down with long riot, grown\r\n      heartless, dark, hungry, but roll back, but rush back, and escape\r\n      who can? The very windows need to be thrown up, that\r\n      Sansculottism may escape fast enough. Money-changer Sections and\r\n      Gilt Youth sweep them forth, with steel besom, far into the\r\n      depths of Saint-Antoine. Triumph once more! The Decrees of that\r\n      Sixty are not so much as rescinded; they are declared null and\r\n      non-extant. Romme, Ruhl, Goujon and the ringleaders, some\r\n      thirteen in all, are decreed Accused. Permanent-session ends at\r\n      three in the morning.[775] Sansculottism, once more flung\r\n      resupine, lies sprawling; sprawling its _last_.\r\n\r\n      Such was the First of Prairial, 20th May, 1795. Second and Third\r\n      of Prairial, during which Sansculottism still sprawled, and\r\n      unexpectedly rang its tocsin, and assembled in arms, availed\r\n      Sansculottism nothing. What though with our Rommes and Ruhls,\r\n      accused but not yet arrested, we make a new “True National\r\n      Convention” of our own, over in the East; and put the others Out\r\n      of Law? What though we rank in arms and march? Armed Force and\r\n      Muscadin Sections, some thirty thousand men, environ that old\r\n      False Convention: we can but bully one another: bandying\r\n      nicknames, ‘_Muscadins_,’ against ‘Blooddrinkers, _Buveurs de\r\n      Sang_.’ Féraud’s Assassin, taken with the red hand, and\r\n      sentenced, and now near to Guillotine and Place de Grève, is\r\n      retaken; is carried back into Saint-Antoine: to no purpose.\r\n      Convention Sectionaries and Gilt Youth come, according to Decree,\r\n      to seek him; nay to disarm Saint-Antoine! And they do disarm it:\r\n      by rolling of cannon, by springing upon enemy’s cannon; by\r\n      military audacity, and terror of the Law. Saint-Antoine\r\n      surrenders its arms; Santerre even advising it, anxious for life\r\n      and brewhouse. Féraud’s Assassin flings himself from a high roof:\r\n      and all is lost.[776]\r\n\r\n      Discerning which things, old Ruhl shot a pistol through his old\r\n      white head; dashed his life in pieces, as he had done the Sacred\r\n      Phial of Rheims. Romme, Goujon and the others stand ranked before\r\n      a swiftly-appointed, swift Military Tribunal. Hearing the\r\n      sentence, Goujon drew a knife, struck it into his breast, passed\r\n      it to his neighbour Romme; and fell dead. Romme did the like; and\r\n      another all but did it; Roman-death rushing on there, as in\r\n      electric-chain, before your Bailiffs could intervene! The\r\n      Guillotine had the rest.\r\n\r\n      They were the _Ultimi Romanorum_. Billaud, Collot and Company are\r\n      now ordered to be tried for life; but are found to be already\r\n      off, shipped for Sinamarri, and the hot mud of Surinam. There let\r\n      Billaud surround himself with flocks of tame parrots; Collot take\r\n      the yellow fever, and drinking a whole bottle of brandy, burn up\r\n      his entrails.[777] Sansculottism spraws no more. The dormant lion\r\n      has become a dead one; and now, as we see, any hoof may smite\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.VI.\r\n      Grilled Herrings.\r\n\r\n      So dies Sansculottism, the _body_ of Sansculottism, or is\r\n      changed. Its ragged Pythian Carmagnole-dance has transformed\r\n      itself into a Pyrrhic, into a dance of Cabarus Balls.\r\n      Sansculottism is dead; extinguished by new _isms_ of that kind,\r\n      which were its own natural progeny; and is buried, we may say,\r\n      with such deafening jubilation and disharmony of funeral-knell on\r\n      their part, that only after some half century or so does one\r\n      begin to learn clearly why it ever was alive.\r\n\r\n      And yet a meaning lay in it: Sansculottism verily was alive, a\r\n      New-Birth of TIME; nay it still lives, and is not dead, but\r\n      changed. The _soul_ of it still lives; still works far and wide,\r\n      through one bodily shape into another less amorphous, as is the\r\n      way of cunning Time with his New-Births:—till, in some perfected\r\n      shape, it embrace the whole circuit of the world! For the wise\r\n      man may now everywhere discern that he must found on his manhood,\r\n      not on the garnitures of his manhood. He who, in these Epochs of\r\n      our Europe, founds on garnitures, formulas, culottisms of what\r\n      sort soever, is founding on old cloth and sheep-skin, and cannot\r\n      endure. But as for the body of Sansculottism, that is dead and\r\n      buried,—and, one hopes, need not reappear, in primary amorphous\r\n      shape, for another thousand years!\r\n\r\n      It was the frightfullest thing ever borne of Time? One of the\r\n      frightfullest. This Convention, now grown Anti-Jacobin, did, with\r\n      an eye to justify and fortify itself, publish Lists of what the\r\n      Reign of Terror had perpetrated: Lists of Persons Guillotined.\r\n      The Lists, cries splenetic Abbé Montgaillard, were not complete.\r\n      They contain the names of, How many persons thinks the\r\n      reader?—Two Thousand all but a few. There were above Four\r\n      Thousand, cries Montgaillard: so many were guillotined,\r\n      fusilladed, noyaded, done to dire death; of whom Nine Hundred\r\n      were women.[778] It is a horrible sum of human lives, M.\r\n      l’Abbé:—some ten times as many shot rightly on a field of battle,\r\n      and one might have had his Glorious-Victory with _Te-Deum_. It is\r\n      not far from the two-hundredth part of what perished in the\r\n      entire Seven Years War. By which Seven Years War, did not the\r\n      great Fritz wrench Silesia from the great Theresa; and a\r\n      Pompadour, stung by epigrams, satisfy herself that she could not\r\n      be an Agnes Sorel? The head of man is a strange vacant\r\n      sounding-shell, M. l’Abbé; and studies Cocker to small purpose.\r\n\r\n      But what if History, somewhere on this Planet, were to hear of a\r\n      Nation, the third soul of whom had not for thirty weeks each year\r\n      as many third-rate potatoes as would sustain him?[779] History,\r\n      in that case, feels bound to consider that starvation is\r\n      starvation; that starvation from age to age presupposes much:\r\n      History ventures to assert that the French Sansculotte of\r\n      Ninety-three, who, roused from long death-sleep, could rush at\r\n      once to the frontiers, and die fighting for an immortal Hope and\r\n      Faith of Deliverance for him and his, was but the\r\n      _second_-miserablest of men! The Irish Sans-potato, had he not\r\n      senses then, nay a soul? In his frozen darkness, it was bitter\r\n      for him to die famishing; bitter to see his children famish. It\r\n      was bitter for him to be a beggar, a liar and a knave. Nay, if\r\n      that dreary Greenland-wind of benighted Want, perennial from sire\r\n      to son, had frozen him into a kind of torpor and numb callosity,\r\n      so that he saw not, felt not, was this, for a creature with a\r\n      soul in it, some assuagement; or the cruellest wretchedness of\r\n      all?\r\n\r\n      Such things were, such things are; and they go on in silence\r\n      peaceably: and Sansculottisms follow them. History, looking back\r\n      over this France through long times, back to Turgot’s time for\r\n      instance, when dumb Drudgery staggered up to its King’s Palace,\r\n      and in wide expanse of sallow faces, squalor and winged\r\n      raggedness, presented hieroglyphically its Petition of\r\n      Grievances; and for answer got hanged on a “new gallows forty\r\n      feet high,”—confesses mournfully that there is no period to be\r\n      met with, in which the general Twenty-five Millions of France\r\n      suffered _less_ than in this period which they name Reign of\r\n      Terror! But it was not the Dumb Millions that suffered here; it\r\n      was the Speaking Thousands, and Hundreds, and Units; who shrieked\r\n      and published, and made the world ring with their wail, as they\r\n      could and should: that is the grand peculiarity. The\r\n      frightfullest Births of Time are never the loud-speaking ones,\r\n      for these soon die; they are the silent ones, which can live from\r\n      century to century! Anarchy, hateful as Death, is abhorrent to\r\n      the whole nature of man; and must itself soon die.\r\n\r\n      Wherefore let all men know what of depth and of height is still\r\n      revealed in man; and, with fear and wonder, with just sympathy\r\n      and just antipathy, with clear eye and open heart, contemplate it\r\n      and appropriate it; and draw innumerable inferences from it. This\r\n      inference, for example, among the first: “That if the gods of\r\n      this lower world will sit on their glittering thrones, indolent\r\n      as Epicurus’ gods, with the living Chaos of Ignorance and Hunger\r\n      weltering uncared for at their feet, and smooth Parasites\r\n      preaching, Peace, peace, when there is no peace,” then the dark\r\n      Chaos, it would seem, will rise; has risen, and O Heavens! has it\r\n      not tanned their skins into breeches for itself? That there be no\r\n      second Sansculottism in our Earth for a thousand years, let us\r\n      understand well what the first was; and let Rich and Poor of us\r\n      go and do _otherwise_.—But to our tale.\r\n\r\n      The Muscadin Sections greatly rejoice; Cabarus Balls gyrate: the\r\n      well-nigh insoluble problem _Republic without Anarchy_, have we\r\n      not solved it?—Law of Fraternity or Death is gone: chimerical\r\n      _Obtain-who-need_ has become practical _Hold-who-have_. To\r\n      anarchic Republic of the Poverties there has succeeded orderly\r\n      Republic of the Luxuries; which will continue as long as it can.\r\n\r\n      On the Pont au Change, on the Place de Grève, in long sheds,\r\n      Mercier, in these summer evenings, saw working men at their\r\n      repast. One’s allotment of daily bread has sunk to an ounce and a\r\n      half. “Plates containing each three grilled herrings, sprinkled\r\n      with shorn onions, wetted with a little vinegar; to this add some\r\n      morsel of boiled prunes, and lentils swimming in a clear sauce:\r\n      at these frugal tables, the cook’s gridiron hissing near by, and\r\n      the pot simmering on a fire between two stones, I have seen them\r\n      ranged by the hundred; consuming, without bread, their scant\r\n      messes, far too moderate for the keenness of their appetite, and\r\n      the extent of their stomach.”[780] Seine water, rushing plenteous\r\n      by, will supply the deficiency.\r\n\r\n      O man of Toil, thy struggling and thy daring, these six long\r\n      years of insurrection and tribulation, thou hast profited nothing\r\n      by it, then? Thou consumest thy herring and water, in the blessed\r\n      gold-red evening. O why was the Earth so beautiful, becrimsoned\r\n      with dawn and twilight, if man’s dealings with man were to make\r\n      it a vale of scarcity, of tears, not even soft tears? Destroying\r\n      of Bastilles, discomfiting of Brunswicks, fronting of\r\n      Principalities and Powers, of Earth and Tophet, all that thou\r\n      hast dared and endured,—it was for a Republic of the Cabarus\r\n      Saloons? Patience; thou must have patience: the end is not yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.VII.\r\n      The Whiff of Grapeshot.\r\n\r\n      In fact, what can be more natural, one may say inevitable, as a\r\n      Post-Sansculottic transitionary state, than even this? Confused\r\n      wreck of a Republic of the Poverties, which ended in Reign of\r\n      Terror, is arranging itself into such composure as it can.\r\n      Evangel of Jean-Jacques, and most other Evangels, becoming\r\n      incredible, what is there for it but return to the old Evangel of\r\n      Mammon? _Contrat-Social_ is true or untrue, Brotherhood is\r\n      Brotherhood or Death; but money always will buy money’s worth: in\r\n      the wreck of human dubitations, this remains indubitable, that\r\n      Pleasure is pleasant. Aristocracy of Feudal Parchment has passed\r\n      away with a mighty rushing; and now, by a natural course, we\r\n      arrive at Aristocracy of the Moneybag. It is the course through\r\n      which all European Societies are at this hour travelling.\r\n      Apparently a still baser sort of Aristocracy? An infinitely\r\n      baser; the basest yet known!\r\n\r\n      In which however there is this advantage, that, like Anarchy\r\n      itself, it cannot continue. Hast thou considered how Thought is\r\n      stronger than Artillery-parks, and (were it fifty years after\r\n      death and martyrdom, or were it two thousand years) writes and\r\n      unwrites Acts of Parliament, removes mountains; models the World\r\n      like soft clay? Also how the beginning of all Thought, worth the\r\n      name, is Love; and the wise head never yet was, without first the\r\n      generous heart? The Heavens cease not their bounty: they send us\r\n      generous hearts into every generation. And now what generous\r\n      heart can pretend to itself, or be hoodwinked into believing,\r\n      that Loyalty to the Moneybag is a noble Loyalty? Mammon, cries\r\n      the generous heart out of all ages and countries, is the basest\r\n      of known Gods, even of known Devils. In him what glory is there,\r\n      that ye should worship him? No glory discernable; not even\r\n      terror: at best, detestability, ill-matched with\r\n      despicability!—Generous hearts, discerning, on this hand,\r\n      widespread Wretchedness, dark without and within, moistening its\r\n      ounce-and-half of bread with tears; and on that hand, mere Balls\r\n      in fleshcoloured drawers, and inane or foul glitter of such\r\n      sort,—cannot but ejaculate, cannot but announce: Too much, O\r\n      divine Mammon; somewhat too much!—The voice of these, once\r\n      announcing itself, carries _fiat_ and _pereat_ in it, for all\r\n      things here below.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, we will hate Anarchy as Death, which it is; and the\r\n      things worse than Anarchy shall be hated _more._ Surely Peace\r\n      alone is fruitful. Anarchy is destruction: a burning up, say, of\r\n      Shams and Insupportabilities; but which leaves Vacancy behind.\r\n      Know this also, that out of a world of Unwise nothing but an\r\n      Unwisdom can be made. Arrange it, Constitution-build it, sift it\r\n      through Ballot-Boxes as thou wilt, it is and remains an\r\n      Unwisdom,—the new prey of new quacks and unclean things, the\r\n      latter end of it slightly better than the beginning. Who can\r\n      bring a wise thing out of men unwise? Not one. And so Vacancy and\r\n      general Abolition having come for this France, what can Anarchy\r\n      do more? Let there be Order, were it under the Soldier’s Sword;\r\n      let there be Peace, that the bounty of the Heavens be not spilt;\r\n      that what of Wisdom they do send us bring fruit in its season!—It\r\n      remains to be seen how the quellers of Sansculottism were\r\n      themselves quelled, and sacred right of Insurrection was blown\r\n      away by gunpowder: wherewith this singular eventful History\r\n      called _French Revolution_ ends.\r\n\r\n      The Convention, driven such a course by wild wind, wild tide, and\r\n      steerage and non-steerage, these three years, has become weary of\r\n      its own existence, sees all men weary of it; and wishes heartily\r\n      to finish. To the last, it has to strive with contradictions: it\r\n      is now getting fast ready with a Constitution, yet knows no\r\n      peace. Sieyes, we say, is making the Constitution once more; has\r\n      as good as made it. Warned by experience, the great Architect\r\n      alters much, admits much. Distinction of Active and Passive\r\n      Citizen, that is, Money-qualification for Electors: nay Two\r\n      Chambers, “Council of Ancients,” as well as “Council of Five\r\n      Hundred;” to that conclusion have we come! In a like spirit,\r\n      eschewing that fatal self-denying ordinance of your Old\r\n      Constituents, we enact not only that actual Convention Members\r\n      are re-eligible, but that Two-thirds of them must be re-elected.\r\n      The Active Citizen Electors shall for this time have free choice\r\n      of only One-third of their National Assembly. Such enactment, of\r\n      Two-thirds to be re-elected, we append to our Constitution; we\r\n      submit our Constitution to the Townships of France, and say,\r\n      Accept _both_, or reject both. Unsavoury as this appendix may be,\r\n      the Townships, by overwhelming majority, accept and ratify. With\r\n      Directory of Five; with Two good Chambers, double-majority of\r\n      them nominated by ourselves, one hopes this Constitution may\r\n      prove final. _March_ it will; for the legs of it, the re-elected\r\n      Two-thirds, are already there, able to march. Sieyes looks at his\r\n      Paper Fabric with just pride.\r\n\r\n      But now see how the contumacious Sections, Lepelletier foremost,\r\n      kick against the pricks! Is it not manifest infraction of one’s\r\n      Elective Franchise, Rights of Man, and Sovereignty of the People,\r\n      this appendix of re-electing _your_ Two-thirds? Greedy tyrants\r\n      who would perpetuate yourselves!—For the truth is, victory over\r\n      Saint-Antoine, and long right of Insurrection, has spoiled these\r\n      men. Nay spoiled all men. Consider too how each man was free to\r\n      hope what he liked; and now there is to be no hope, there is to\r\n      be fruition, fruition of _this_.\r\n\r\n      In men spoiled by long right of Insurrection, what confused\r\n      ferments will rise, tongues once begun wagging! Journalists\r\n      declaim, your Lacretelles, Laharpes; Orators spout. There is\r\n      Royalism traceable in it, and Jacobinism. On the West Frontier,\r\n      in deep secrecy, Pichegru, durst he trust his Army, is treating\r\n      with Condé: in these Sections, there spout wolves in sheep’s\r\n      clothing, masked Emigrants and Royalists![781] All men, as we\r\n      say, had hoped, each that the Election would do something for his\r\n      own side: and now there is no Election, or only the third of one.\r\n      Black is united with white against this clause of the Two-thirds;\r\n      all the Unruly of France, who see their trade thereby near\r\n      ending.\r\n\r\n      Section Lepelletier, after Addresses enough, finds that such\r\n      clause is a manifest infraction; that it, Lepelletier, for one,\r\n      will simply not conform thereto; and invites all other free\r\n      Sections to join it, “in central Committee,” in resistance to\r\n      oppression.[782] The Sections join it, nearly all; strong with\r\n      their Forty Thousand fighting men. The Convention therefore may\r\n      look to itself! Lepelletier, on this 12th day of Vendémiaire, 4th\r\n      of October 1795, is sitting in open contravention, in its Convent\r\n      of Filles Saint-Thomas, Rue Vivienne, with guns primed. The\r\n      Convention has some Five Thousand regular troops at hand;\r\n      Generals in abundance; and a Fifteen Hundred of miscellaneous\r\n      persecuted Ultra-Jacobins, whom in this crisis it has hastily got\r\n      together and armed, under the title _Patriots of Eighty-nine_.\r\n      Strong in Law, it sends its General Menou to disarm Lepelletier.\r\n\r\n      General Menou marches accordingly, with due summons and\r\n      demonstration; with no result. General Menou, about eight in the\r\n      evening, finds that he is standing ranked in the Rue Vivienne,\r\n      emitting vain summonses; with primed guns pointed out of every\r\n      window at him; and that he cannot disarm Lepelletier. He has to\r\n      return, with whole skin, but without success; and be thrown into\r\n      arrest as “a traitor.” Whereupon the whole Forty Thousand join\r\n      this Lepelletier which cannot be vanquished: to what hand shall a\r\n      quaking Convention now turn? Our poor Convention, after such\r\n      voyaging, just entering harbour, so to speak, has _struck on the\r\n      bar;_—and labours there frightfully, with breakers roaring round\r\n      it, Forty thousand of them, like to wash it, and its Sieyes Cargo\r\n      and the whole future of France, into the deep! Yet one last time,\r\n      it struggles, ready to perish.\r\n\r\n      Some call for Barras to be made Commandant; he conquered in\r\n      Thermidor. Some, what is more to the purpose, bethink them of the\r\n      Citizen Buonaparte, unemployed Artillery Officer, who took\r\n      Toulon. A man of head, a man of action: Barras is named\r\n      Commandant’s-Cloak; this young Artillery Officer is named\r\n      Commandant. He was in the Gallery at the moment, and heard it; he\r\n      withdrew, some half hour, to consider with himself: after a half\r\n      hour of grim compressed considering, to be or not to be, he\r\n      answers _Yea_.\r\n\r\n      And now, a man of head being at the centre of it, the whole\r\n      matter gets vital. Swift, to Camp of Sablons; to secure the\r\n      Artillery, there are not twenty men guarding it! A swift\r\n      Adjutant, Murat is the name of him, gallops; gets thither some\r\n      minutes within time, for Lepelletier was also on march that way:\r\n      the Cannon are ours. And now beset this post, and beset that;\r\n      rapid and firm: at Wicket of the Louvre, in Cul de Sac Dauphin,\r\n      in Rue Saint-Honoré, from Pont Neuf all along the north Quays,\r\n      southward to Pont _ci-devant_ Royal,—rank round the Sanctuary of\r\n      the Tuileries, a ring of steel discipline; let every gunner have\r\n      his match burning, and all men stand to their arms!\r\n\r\n      Thus there is Permanent-session through night; and thus at\r\n      sunrise of the morrow, there is seen sacred Insurrection once\r\n      again: vessel of State labouring on the bar; and tumultuous sea\r\n      all round her, beating _générale_, arming and sounding,—not\r\n      ringing tocsin, for we have left no tocsin but our own in the\r\n      Pavilion of Unity. It is an imminence of shipwreck, for the whole\r\n      world to gaze at. Frightfully she labours, that poor ship, within\r\n      cable-length of port; huge peril for her. However, she has a man\r\n      at the helm. Insurgent messages, received, and not received;\r\n      messenger admitted blindfolded; counsel and counter-counsel: the\r\n      poor ship labours!—Vendémiaire 13th, year 4: curious enough, of\r\n      all days, it is the Fifth day of October, anniversary of that\r\n      Menad-march, six years ago; by sacred right of Insurrection we\r\n      are got thus far.\r\n\r\n      Lepelletier has seized the Church of Saint-Roch; has seized the\r\n      Pont Neuf, our piquet there retreating without fire. Stray shots\r\n      fall from Lepelletier; rattle down on the very Tuileries\r\n      staircase. On the other hand, women advance dishevelled,\r\n      shrieking, Peace; Lepelletier behind them waving its hat in sign\r\n      that we shall fraternise. Steady! The Artillery Officer is steady\r\n      as bronze; can be quick as lightning. He sends eight hundred\r\n      muskets with ball-cartridges to the Convention itself; honourable\r\n      Members shall act with these in case of extremity: whereat they\r\n      look grave enough. Four of the afternoon is struck.[783]\r\n      Lepelletier, making nothing by messengers, by fraternity or\r\n      hat-waving, bursts out, along the Southern Quai Voltaire, along\r\n      streets, and passages, treble-quick, in huge veritable onslaught!\r\n      Whereupon, thou bronze Artillery Officer—? ‘Fire!’ say the bronze\r\n      lips. Roar and again roar, continual, volcano-like, goes his\r\n      great gun, in the Cul de Sac Dauphin against the Church of\r\n      Saint-Roch; go his great guns on the Pont Royal; go all his great\r\n      guns;—blow to air some two hundred men, mainly about the Church\r\n      of Saint-Roch! Lepelletier cannot stand such horse-play; no\r\n      Sectioner can stand it; the Forty-thousand yield on all sides,\r\n      scour towards covert. “Some hundred or so of them gathered both\r\n      Theatre de la République; but,” says he, “a few shells dislodged\r\n      them. It was all finished at six.”\r\n\r\n      The Ship is _over_ the bar, then; free she bounds shoreward,—amid\r\n      shouting and vivats! Citoyen Buonaparte is “named General of the\r\n      Interior, by acclamation;” quelled Sections have to disarm in\r\n      such humour as they may; sacred right of Insurrection is gone for\r\n      ever! The Sieyes Constitution can disembark itself, and begin\r\n      marching. The miraculous Convention Ship has got to land;—and is\r\n      there, shall we figuratively say, changed, as Epic Ships are\r\n      wont, into a kind of _Sea Nymph_, never to sail more; to roam the\r\n      waste Azure, a Miracle in History!\r\n\r\n      “It is false,” says Napoleon, “that we fired first with blank\r\n      charge; it had been a waste of life to do that.” Most false: the\r\n      firing was with sharp and sharpest shot: to all men it was plain\r\n      that here was no sport; the rabbets and plinths of Saint-Roch\r\n      Church show splintered by it, to this hour.—Singular: in old\r\n      Broglie’s time, six years ago, this Whiff of Grapeshot was\r\n      promised; but it could not be given then, could not have profited\r\n      then. Now, however, the time is come for it, and the man; and\r\n      behold, you have it; and the thing we specifically call _French\r\n      Revolution_ is blown into space by it, and become a thing that\r\n      was!—\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter 3.7.VIII.\r\n      Finis.\r\n\r\n      Homer’s Epos, it is remarked, is like a Bas-relief sculpture: it\r\n      does not conclude, but merely ceases. Such, indeed, is the Epos\r\n      of Universal History itself. Directorates, Consulates,\r\n      Emperorships, Restorations, Citizen-Kingships succeed this\r\n      Business in due series, in due genesis one out of the other.\r\n      Nevertheless the First-parent of all these may be said to have\r\n      gone to air in the way we see. A Baboeuf Insurrection, next year,\r\n      will die in the birth; stifled by the Soldiery. A Senate, if\r\n      tinged with Royalism, can be purged by the Soldiery; and an\r\n      Eighteenth of Fructidor transacted by the mere shew of\r\n      bayonets.[784] Nay Soldiers’ bayonets can be used _à posteriori_\r\n      on a Senate, and make it leap out of window,—still bloodless; and\r\n      produce an Eighteenth of Brumaire.[785] Such changes must happen:\r\n      but they are managed by intriguings, caballings, and then by\r\n      orderly word of command; almost like mere changes of Ministry.\r\n      Not in general by sacred right of Insurrection, but by milder\r\n      methods growing ever milder, shall the Events of French history\r\n      be henceforth brought to pass.\r\n\r\n      It is admitted that this Directorate, which owned, at its\r\n      starting, these three things, an “old table, a sheet of paper,\r\n      and an ink-bottle,” and no visible money or arrangement\r\n      whatever,[786] did wonders: that France, since the Reign of\r\n      Terror hushed itself, has been a new France, awakened like a\r\n      giant out of torpor; and has gone on, in the Internal Life of it,\r\n      with continual progress. As for the External form and forms of\r\n      Life,—what can we say except that out of the Eater there comes\r\n      Strength; out of the Unwise there comes _not_ Wisdom! Shams are\r\n      burnt up; nay, what as yet is the peculiarity of France, the very\r\n      Cant of them is burnt up. The new Realities are not yet come: ah\r\n      no, only Phantasms, Paper models, tentative Prefigurements of\r\n      such! In France there are now Four Million Landed Properties;\r\n      that black portent of an Agrarian Law is as it were _realised._\r\n      What is still stranger, we understand all Frenchmen have “the\r\n      right of duel;” the Hackney-coachman with the Peer, if insult be\r\n      given: such is the law of Public Opinion. Equality at least in\r\n      death! The Form of Government is by Citizen King, frequently shot\r\n      at, not yet shot.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, therefore, has it not been fulfilled what was\r\n      prophesied, _ex-postfacto_ indeed, by the Archquack Cagliostro,\r\n      or another? He, as he looked in rapt vision and amazement into\r\n      these things, thus spake:[787] “Ha! What is _this?_ Angels,\r\n      Uriel, Anachiel, and the other Five; Pentagon of Rejuvenescence;\r\n      Power that destroyed Original Sin; Earth, Heaven, and thou Outer\r\n      Limbo, which men name Hell! Does the EMPIRE Of IMPOSTURE waver?\r\n      Burst there, in starry sheen updarting, Light-rays from out _its_\r\n      dark foundations; as it rocks and heaves, not in travail-throes,\r\n      but in death-throes? Yea, Light-rays, piercing, clear, that\r\n      salute the Heavens,—lo, they _kindle_ it; their starry clearness\r\n      becomes as red Hellfire!\r\n\r\n      “IMPOSTURE is in flames, Imposture is burnt up: one red sea of\r\n      Fire, wild-billowing enwraps the World; with its fire-tongue,\r\n      licks at the very Stars. Thrones are hurled into it, and Dubois\r\n      mitres, and Prebendal Stalls that drop fatness, and—ha! what see\r\n      I?—all the _Gigs_ of Creation; all, all! Wo is me! Never since\r\n      Pharaoh’s Chariots, in the Red-sea of water, was there wreck of\r\n      Wheel-vehicles like this in the Sea of Fire. Desolate, as ashes,\r\n      as gases, shall they wander in the wind.\r\n\r\n      Higher, higher yet flames the Fire-Sea; crackling with new\r\n      dislocated timber; hissing with leather and prunella. The metal\r\n      Images are molten; the marble Images become mortar-lime; the\r\n      stone Mountains sulkily explode. RESPECTABILITY, with all her\r\n      collected Gigs inflamed for funeral pyre, wailing, leaves the\r\n      earth: not to return save under new Avatar. Imposture, how it\r\n      burns, through generations: how it is burnt up; for a time. The\r\n      World is black ashes; which, ah, when will they grow green? The\r\n      Images all run into amorphous Corinthian brass; all Dwellings of\r\n      men destroyed; the very mountains peeled and riven, the valleys\r\n      black and dead: it is an empty World! Wo to them that shall be\r\n      born then!—A King, a Queen (ah me!) were hurled in; did rustle\r\n      once; flew aloft, crackling, like paper-scroll. Iscariot Egalité\r\n      was hurled in; thou grim De Launay, with thy grim Bastille; whole\r\n      kindreds and peoples; five millions of mutually destroying Men.\r\n      For it is the End of the Dominion of IMPOSTURE (which is Darkness\r\n      and opaque Firedamp); and the burning up, with unquenchable fire,\r\n      of all the Gigs that are in the Earth.” This Prophecy, we say,\r\n      has it not been fulfilled, is it not fulfilling?\r\n\r\n      And so here, O Reader, has the time come for us two to part.\r\n      Toilsome was our journeying together; not without offence; but it\r\n      is done. To me thou wert as a beloved shade, the disembodied or\r\n      not yet embodied spirit of a Brother. To thee I was but as a\r\n      Voice. Yet was our relation a kind of sacred one; doubt not that!\r\n      Whatsoever once sacred things become hollow jargons, yet while\r\n      the Voice of Man speaks with Man, hast thou not there the living\r\n      fountain out of which all sacrednesses sprang, and will yet\r\n      spring? Man, by the nature of him, is definable as “an incarnated\r\n      Word.” Ill stands it with me if I have spoken falsely: thine also\r\n      it was to hear truly.
