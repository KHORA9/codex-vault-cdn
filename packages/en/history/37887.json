In the midst of engrossing cares you have often\r\nbeen pleased to turn aside for a while to foster those who were\r\nfollowing the humbler and quieter walks of literature; and it is,\r\nnaturally, their delight to offer for your acceptance, upon every\r\nsuitable occasion, an acknowledgment of cordial thankfulness.\r\n\r\nAllow me, then, as the only tribute I can tender, to present a work\r\ndesigned to illustrate the history and resources of one of those\r\nAmerican States which were summoned into the brotherhood of nations by\r\nyour sympathy and eloquence.\r\n\r\n  I am, with the greatest respect,\r\n  Your friend and servant,\r\n  BRANTZ MAYER.\r\n\r\n  BALTIMORE, JULY, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have always felt a deep interest in\r\nthe history and destiny of Mexico. It was not only the commercial\r\nspirit of our citizens that awakened this sentiment. In former times,\r\nwhen the exclusive policy of Spain closed the door of intercourse with\r\nher American colonies, the ancient history of Peru and Mexico\r\nattracted the curiosity of our students. They were eager to solve the\r\nenigma of a strange civilization which had originated in the central\r\nportions of our continent in isolated independence of all the world.\r\nThey desired, moreover, to know something of those enchanted regions,\r\nwhich, like the fabled garden of the Hesperides, were watched and\r\nwarded with such jealous vigilance; and they craved to behold those\r\nmarvelous mines whose boundless wealth was poured into the lap of\r\nSpain. The valuable work of Baron Humboldt, published in the early\r\npart of this century, stimulated this natural curiosity; and, when the\r\nrevolutionary spirit of Europe penetrated our continent, and the\r\nmasses rose to cast off colonial bondage, we hailed with joy every\r\neffort of the patriots who fought so bravely in the war of liberation.\r\nBound to Mexico by geographical ties, though without a common language\r\nor lineage, we were the first to welcome her and the new American\r\nSovereignties into the brotherhood of nations, and to fortify our\r\ncontinental alliance by embassies and treaties.\r\n\r\nAfter more than twenty years of peaceful intercourse, the war of 1846\r\nbroke out between Mexico and our Union. Thousands, of all classes,\r\nprofessions and occupations,--educated and uneducated--observers and\r\nidlers,--poured into the territory of the invaded republic. In the\r\ncourse of the conflict these sturdy adventurers traversed the central\r\nand northern regions of Mexico, scoured her coasts, possessed\r\nthemselves for many months of her beautiful Capital, and although they\r\nreturned to their homes worn with the toils of war, none have ceased\r\nto remember the delicious land, amid whose sunny valleys and majestic\r\nmountains they had learned, at least, to admire the sublimity of\r\nnature. The returned warriors did not fail to report around their\r\nfiresides the marvels they witnessed during their campaigns, and\r\nnumerous works have been written to sketch the story of individual\r\nadventure, or to portray the most interesting physical features of\r\nvarious sections of the republic. Thus by war and literature, by\r\nancient curiosity and political sympathy, by geographical position and\r\ncommercial interest, Mexico has become perhaps the most interesting\r\nportion of the world to our countrymen at the present moment. And I\r\nhave been led to believe that the American people would not receive\r\nunfavorably a work designed to describe the entire country, to develop\r\nits resources and condition, and to sketch impartially its history\r\nfrom the conquest to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt has been no ordinary task to chronicle the career of a nation for\r\nmore than three centuries, to unveil the colonial government of\r\nsixty-two Viceroys, to follow the thread of war and politics through\r\nthe mazes of revolution, and to track the rebellious spirit of\r\nintrigue amid the numerous civil outbreaks which have occurred since\r\nthe downfall of Iturbide. The complete Viceroyal history of Mexico is\r\nnow for the first time presented to the world in the English language,\r\nwhile, in Spanish, no single author has ever attempted it\r\ncontinuously. Free from the bias of Mexican partizanship, I have\r\nendeavored to narrate events fairly, and to paint character without\r\nregard to individual men. In describing the country, its resources,\r\ngeography, finances, church, agriculture, army, industrial condition,\r\nand social as well as political prospects, I have taken care to\r\nprovide myself with the most recent and respectable authorities. My\r\nresidence in the country, and intimacy with many of its educated and\r\nintelligent patriots, enabled me to gather information in which I\r\nconfided, and I have endeavored to fuse the whole mass of knowledge\r\nthus laboriously procured, with my personal, and, I hope,\r\nunprejudiced, observation.\r\n\r\nI have not deemed it proper to encumber the margin of my pages with\r\ncontinual references to authorities that are rarely consulted by\r\ngeneral readers, and could only be desired by critics who would often\r\nbe tantalized by the citation of works, which, in all likelihood, are\r\nnot to be found except in private collections in the United States,\r\nand some of which, I am quite sure, exist only in my own library or in\r\nthe Mexican Legation, at Washington. Such references, whilst they\r\noccupied an undue portion of the book, would be ostentatiously and\r\ntediously pedantic in a work of so little pretension as mine. I may\r\nstate, however, that no important fact has been asserted without\r\nauthority, and, in order to indicate the greater portion of my\r\npublished sources of reliance, I have subjoined a list of the\r\nprincipal materials consulted and carefully verified in the\r\ncomposition of these volumes. Nevertheless, I have perhaps failed\r\nsometimes to procure the standard works that are accessible to native\r\nor permanent residents of the country, and thus, may have fallen\r\naccidental into error, whilst honestly seeking to shun misstatement.\r\nIf those whose information enables them to detect important mistakes\r\nwill be kind enough to point them out candidly and clearly, I will\r\ngladly correct such serious faults if another edition should ever be\r\nrequired by an indulgent public.\r\n\r\n  BRANTZ MAYER.\r\n\r\n  BALTIMORE, AUGUST, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

dramatic\r\nincidents and useful consequences, as that which records the\r\ndiscovery, conquest and development of America by the Spanish and\r\nAnglo Saxon races. The extraordinary achievements of Columbus, Cortéz,\r\nPizarro, and Washington, have resulted in the acquisition of broad\r\nlands, immense wealth, and rational liberty; and the names of these\r\nheroes are thus indissolubly connected with the physical and\r\nintellectual progress of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we propose to write the history, and depict the\r\nmanners, customs and condition of MEXICO. Our narrative begins with\r\nthe first movements that were made for the conquest of the country;\r\nyet, we shall recount, fully and accurately, the story of those Indian\r\nprinces,--the splendor of whose courts, and the misery of whose tragic\r\ndoom, enhance the picturesque grandeur and solemn lessons that are\r\nexhibited in the career of Hernando Cortéz.\r\n\r\nCuba was the second island discovered, in the West Indies; but it was\r\nnot until 1511, that Diego, son of the gallant admiral, who had\r\nhitherto maintained the seat of government in Hispaniola, resolved to\r\noccupy the adjacent isle of Fernandina,--as it was then called,--amid\r\nwhose virgin mountains and forests he hoped to find new mines to\r\nrepair the loss of those which were rapidly failing in Hispaniola.[1]\r\n\r\nFor the conquest of this imagined El Dorado, he prepared a small\r\narmament, under the command of Diego Velasquez, an ambitious and\r\ncovetous leader, who, together with his lieutenant, Narvaez, soon\r\nestablished the Spanish authority in the island, of which he was\r\nappointed Governor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColumbus, after coasting the shores of Cuba for a great distance, had\r\nalways believed that it constituted a portion of the continent, but it\r\nwas soon discovered that the illustrious admiral had been in error, and\r\nthat Cuba, extensive as it appeared to be, was, in fact, only an island.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1517, a Spanish _hidalgo_, Hernandez de Cordova, set\r\nsail, with three vessels, towards the adjacent Bahamas in search of\r\nslaves. He was driven by a succession of severe storms on coasts which\r\nhad hitherto been unknown to the Spanish adventurers, and finally\r\nlanded on that part of the continent which forms the north-eastern end\r\nof the peninsula of Yucatan, and is known as Cape Catoché. Here he\r\nfirst discovered the evidence of a more liberal civilization than had\r\nbeen hitherto known among his adventurous countrymen in the New World.\r\nLarge and solid buildings, formed of stone;--cultivated\r\nfields;--delicate fabrics of cotton and precious metals,--indicated\r\nthe presence of a race that had long emerged from the semi-barbarism\r\nof the Indian Isles. The bold but accidental explorer continued his\r\nvoyage along the coast of the peninsula until he reached the site of\r\nCampeché; and then, after an absence of seven months and severe losses\r\namong his men, returned to Cuba, with but half the number of his\r\nreckless companions. He brought back with him, however, numerous\r\nevidences of the wealth and progress of the people he had fortuitously\r\ndiscovered on the American main; but he soon died, and left to others\r\nthe task of completing the enterprise he had so auspiciously begun.\r\nThe fruits of his discoveries remained to be gathered by Velasquez,\r\nwho at once equipped four vessels and entrusted them to the command\r\nof his nephew, Juan de Grijalva, and on the 1st of May, 1518, this new\r\ncommander left the port of St. Jago de Cuba. The first land he touched\r\non his voyage of discovery, was the Island of Cozumel, whence he\r\npassed to the continent, glancing at the spots that had been\r\npreviously visited by Cordova. So struck was he by the architecture,\r\nthe improved agriculture, the civilized tastes, the friendly character\r\nand demeanor of the inhabitants, and, especially, by the sight of\r\n\"large stone crosses, evidently objects of worship,\" that, in the\r\nenthusiasm of the moment, he gave to the land the name of Nueva\r\nEspaña-or New Spain,--a title which has since been extended from the\r\npeninsula of Yucatan to even more than the entire empire of Montezuma\r\nand the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nGrijalva did not content himself with a mere casual visit to the\r\ncontinent, but pursued his course along the coast, stopping at the Rio\r\nde Tabasco. Whilst at Rio de Vanderas, he enjoyed the first\r\nintercourse that ever took place between the Spaniards and Mexicans.\r\nThe _Cacique_ of the Province sought from the strangers a full account\r\nof their distant country and the motives of their visit, in order that\r\nhe might convey the intelligence to his Aztec master. Presents were\r\ninterchanged, and Grijalva received, in return for his toys and\r\ntinsel, a mass of jewels, together with ornaments and vessels of gold,\r\nwhich satisfied the adventurers that they had reached a country whose\r\nresources would repay them for the toil of further exploration.\r\nAccordingly, he despatched to Cuba with the joyous news, Pedro de\r\nAlvarado, one of his captains,--a man who was destined to play a\r\nconspicuous part in the future conquest,--whilst he, with the\r\nremainder of his companies, continued his coasting voyage to San Juan\r\nde Ulua, the Island of Sacrificios, and the northern shores, until he\r\nreached the Province of Panuco; whence, after an absence of six\r\nmonths, he set sail for Cuba, having been the first Spanish adventurer\r\nwho trod the soil of Mexico.\r\n\r\nBut his return was not hailed even with gratitude. The florid reports\r\nof Pedro de Alvarado had already inflamed the ambition and avarice of\r\nVelasquez, who, impatient of the prolonged absence of Grijalva, had\r\ndespatched a vessel under the command of Olid in search of his tardy\r\nofficer. Nor was he content with this jealous exhibition of his\r\ntemper; for, anxious to secure to himself all the glory and treasure\r\nto be derived from the boundless resources of a continent, he\r\nsolicited authority from the Spanish crown to prosecute the adventures\r\nthat had been so auspiciously begun; and, in the meanwhile, after\r\nconsiderable deliberation, resolved to fit out another armament on a\r\nscale, in some degree, commensurate with the military subjugation of\r\nthe country, should he find himself opposed by its sovereign and\r\npeople. After considerable doubt, difficulty and delay, he resolved to\r\nentrust this expedition to the command of HERNANDO CORTÉZ; \"the last\r\nman,\" says Prescott, \"to whom Velasquez,--could he have foreseen the\r\nresults,--would have confided the enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will not be foreign to our purpose to sketch, briefly, the previous\r\nlife of a man who subsequently became so eminent in the history of\r\nboth worlds. Seven years before Columbus planted the standard of\r\nCastile and Arragon in the West Indies, HERNANDO CORTÉZ, was born, of\r\na noble lineage, in the town of Medellin, in the Province of\r\nEstremadura, in Spain. His infancy was frail and delicate, but his\r\nconstitution strengthened as he grew, until, at the age of fourteen,\r\nhe was placed in the venerable university of Salamanca, where his\r\nparents, who rejoiced in the extreme vivacity of his talents, designed\r\nto prepare him for the profession of law, the emoluments of which\r\nwere, at that period, most tempting in Spain. But the restless spirit\r\nof the future conqueror was not to be manacled by the musty ritual of\r\na tedious science whose pursuit would confine him to a quiet life. He\r\nwasted two years at the college, and, like many men who subsequently\r\nbecame renowned either for thought or action, was finally sent home in\r\ndisgrace. Nevertheless, in the midst of his recklessness, and by the\r\nquickness of his genius, he had learned \"a little store of Latin,\" and\r\nacquired the habit of writing good prose, or of versifying agreeably.\r\nHis father,--Don Martin Cortéz de Monroy, and his mother, Doña\r\nCatalina Pizarro Altamirano,--seem to have been accomplished people,\r\nnor is it improbable, that the greater part of their son's information\r\nwas obtained under the influence of the domestic circle. At college he\r\nwas free from all restraint,--giving himself up to the spirit of\r\nadventure, the pursuit of pleasure, and convivial intercourse,--so\r\nthat no hope was entertained of his further improvement from\r\nscholastic studies. His worthy parents were, moreover, people of\r\nlimited fortune, and unable to prolong these agreeable but profitless\r\npursuits. Accordingly, when Cortéz attained the age of seventeen, they\r\nyielded to his proposal to enlist under the banner of GONSALVO OF\r\nCORDOVA, and to devote himself, heart and soul, to the military life\r\nwhich seemed most suitable for one of his wild, adventurous and\r\nresolute disposition. It was well for Spain and for himself, that the\r\nchivalric wish of Cortéz was not thwarted,--and that one of the ablest\r\nsoldiers produced by Castile at that period, was not dwarfed by\r\nparental control into a bad lawyer or pestilent pettifogger.\r\n\r\nThe attention of our hero was soon directed towards the New\r\nWorld,--the stories of whose wealth had now for upwards of twenty\r\nyears been pouring into the greedy ear of Spain,--and he speedily\r\ndetermined to embark in the armament which NICOLAS DE OVANDO, the\r\nsuccessor of Columbus, was fitting out for the West Indies. This\r\ndesign was frustrated, however, for two years longer, by an accident\r\nwhich occurred in one of his amours; nor did another opportunity\r\npresent itself, until, at the age of nineteen, in 1504, he bade adieu\r\nto Spain in a small squadron bound to the Islands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cortéz reached Hispaniola, he visited the Governor, whom he\r\nhad formerly known at home. OVANDO was absent, but his secretary\r\nreceived the emigrant kindly, and assured him \"a liberal grant of\r\nland.\" \"I come for _gold_,\" replied Cortéz, sneeringly, \"and not to\r\ntoil like a peasant!\" Ovando, however, was more fortunate than the\r\nsecretary, in prevailing upon the future conqueror to forego the\r\nlottery of adventure, for no sooner had he returned to his post, than\r\nCortéz was persuaded to accept a grant of land, a _repartimiento_ of\r\nIndians, and the office of notary in the village of Açua. Here he\r\nseems to have dwelt until 1511, varying the routine of notarial and\r\nagricultural pursuits by an occasional adventure, of an amorous\r\ncharacter, which involved him in duels. Sometimes he took part in the\r\nmilitary expeditions under Diego Velasquez for the suppression of\r\nIndian insurrections in the interior. This was the school in which he\r\nlearned his tactics, and here did he study the native character until\r\nhe joined Velasquez for the conquest of Cuba.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this famous Island was reduced to Spanish authority, Cortéz\r\nbecame high in favor with Velasquez, who had received the commission of\r\nGovernor. But love, intrigues, jealousy and ambition, quickly began to\r\nchequer the wayward life of our hero, and estranged him from Velasquez,\r\nfor the new Governor found it difficult to satisfy the cravings of those\r\nrapacious adventurers who flocked in crowds to the New World, and, in\r\nall probability, clustered around Cortéz as the nucleus of discontent.\r\nIt was soon resolved by these men to submit their complaints against\r\nVelasquez to the higher authorities in Hispaniola, and the daring Cortéz\r\nwas fixed on as the bearer of the message in an open boat, across the\r\neighteen intervening leagues. But the conspiracy was detected,--the rash\r\nambassador confined in chains,--and only saved from hanging by the\r\ninterposition of powerful friends.\r\n\r\nCortéz speedily contrived to relieve himself of the fetters with which\r\nhe was bound, and, forcing a window, escaped from his prison to the\r\nsanctuary of a neighboring church. A few days after, however, he was\r\nseized whilst standing carelessly in front of the sacred edifice, and\r\nconveyed on board a vessel bound for Hispaniola, where he was to be\r\ntried. But his intrepidity and skill did not forsake him even in this\r\nstrait. Ascending cautiously from the vessel's hold to the deck, he\r\ndropped into a boat and pulled near ashore, when dreading to risk the\r\nfrail bark in the breakers, he abandoned his skiff,--plunged boldly\r\ninto the surf,--and landing on the sands, sought again the sanctuary,\r\nwhence he had been rudely snatched by the myrmidons of the Governor.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of his quarrel with Velasquez had been an intrigue\r\nwith a beautiful woman, in whose family the Governor was, perhaps,\r\npersonally interested. The fickle Cortéz cruelly abandoned the fair\r\nCatalina Xuares at a most inauspicious moment of her fate, and was\r\ncondemned for his conduct by all the best people in the Island; but\r\nnow, under the influence of penitence or policy, his feelings suddenly\r\nexperienced a strange revulsion. He expressed a contrite desire to do\r\njustice to the injured woman by marriage, and thus, at once obtained\r\nthe favor of her family and the pardon of the Governor, who becoming\r\npermanently reconciled to Cortéz, presented him a liberal\r\n_repartimiento_ of Indians together with broad lands in the\r\nneighborhood of St. Jago, of which he was soon made _alcalde_.\r\n\r\nThe future conqueror devoted himself henceforth to his duties with\r\nremarkable assiduity. Agriculture,--the introduction of cattle of the\r\nbest breeds,--and the revenues of a share of the mines which he\r\nwrought,--soon began to enrich the restless adventurer who had settled\r\ndown for a while into the quiet life of a married man. His beautiful\r\nwife fulfilled her share of the cares of life with remarkable\r\nfidelity, and seems to have contented the heart even of her liege\r\nlord, who declared himself as happy with his bride as if she had been\r\nthe daughter of a duchess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this juncture ALVARADO returned with the account of the\r\ndiscoveries, the wealth, and the golden prospects of continental\r\nadventure which we have already narrated. Cortéz and Velasquez were\r\nalike fired by the alluring story. The old flame of enterprise was\r\nrekindled in the breast of the wild boy of Medellin, and when the\r\nGovernor looked around for one who could command the projected\r\nexpedition, he found none, among the hosts who pressed for service,\r\nbetter fitted for the enterprise by personal qualities and fortune,\r\nthan Hernando Cortéz, whom he named CAPTAIN GENERAL OF HIS ARMADA.\r\n\r\nThe high office and the important task imposed on him seem to have\r\nsobered the excitable, and heretofore fickle, mind of our hero. His\r\nardent animal spirits, under the influence of a bold and lofty\r\npurpose, became the servants rather than the masters of his\r\nindomitable will, and he at once proceeded to arrange all the details\r\nof the expedition which he was to lead to Mexico. The means that he\r\ndid not already possess in his own coffers, he raised by mortgage, and\r\nhe applied the funds, thus obtained, to the purchase of vessels,\r\nrations, and military stores, or to the furnishing of adequate\r\nequipments for adventurers who were too poor to provide their own\r\noutfit. It is somewhat questionable whether Velasquez, the Governor,\r\nwas very liberal in his personal and pecuniary contributions to this\r\nexpedition, the cost of which amounted to about twenty thousand gold\r\nducats. It has been alleged that Cortéz was the chief support of the\r\nadventure, and it is certain, that in later years, this question\r\nresulted in bitter litigation between the parties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix ships and three hundred followers were soon prepared for the\r\nenterprise under Cortéz, and the Governor proceeded to give\r\ninstructions to the leader, all of which are couched in language of\r\nunquestionable liberality.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Armada was first to seek the missing Grijalva,\r\nafter which the two commanders were to unite in their quest of gold\r\nand adventure. Six Christians, supposed to be lingering in captivity\r\nin Yucatan, were to be sought and released. Barter and traffic,\r\ngenerally, with the natives were to be encouraged and carried on, so\r\nas to avoid all offence against humanity or kindness. The Indians were\r\nto be christianized;--for the conversion of heathens was one of the\r\ndearest objects of the Spanish king. The aborigines, in turn, were to\r\nmanifest their good will by ample gifts of jewels and treasure. The\r\ncoasts and adjacent streams were to be surveyed,--and the productions\r\nof the country, its races, civilization, and institutions, were to be\r\nnoted with minute accuracy, so that a faithful report might be\r\nreturned to the crown, to whose honor and the service of God, it was\r\nhoped the enterprise would certainly redound.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things in the port of St. Jago, when jealous\r\nfears began to interrupt the confidence between Velasquez and Cortéz.\r\nThe counsel of friends who were companions of the Governor, and his\r\nown notice of that personage's altered conduct, soon put the new\r\nCaptain General of the Armada on his guard. Neither his equipment nor\r\nhis crew was yet complete; nevertheless, he supplied his fleet with\r\nall the provisions he could hastily obtain at midnight; and, paying\r\nthe provider with a massive chain which he had worn about his\r\nneck,--the last available remnant, perhaps, of his fortune,--he\r\nhastened with his officers on board the vessels.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of November, 1518, he made sail for the port of Macaca,\r\nabout fifteen leagues distant, and thence he proceeded to Trinidad, on\r\nthe southern coast of Cuba. Here he obtained stores from the royal\r\nfarms, whilst he recruited his forces from all classes, but especially\r\nfrom the returned troops and sailors of Grijalva's expedition. Pedro de\r\nAlvarado and his brothers; Cristoval de Olid, Alonzo de Avila, Juan\r\nVelasquez de Leon, Hernandez de Puerto Carrero, and Gonzalo de Sandoval,\r\nunited their fortunes to his, and thus identified themselves forever\r\nwith the conquest of Mexico. He added considerably to his stock by the\r\nseizure of several vessels and cargoes; and prudently got rid of Diego\r\nde Ordaz, whom he regarded as a spy of the estranged Velasquez.\r\n\r\nAt Trinidad, Cortéz was overtaken by orders for detention from his\r\nformer friend and patron. These commands, however, were not enforced\r\nby the cautious official who received them; and Cortéz, forthwith,\r\ndespatched Alvarado, by land, to Havana, whilst he prepared to follow\r\nwith his fleet around the coast and western part of the island. At\r\nHavana he again added to his forces,--prepared arms and quilted armor\r\nas a defence against the Indian arrows,--and distributed his men into\r\neleven companies under the command of experienced officers. But,\r\nbefore all his arrangements were completed, the commander of the\r\nplace, Don Pedro Barba, was ordered, by express from Velasquez, to\r\n_arrest_ Cortéz, whilst the Captain General of the Armada himself\r\nreceived a hypocritical letter from the same personage, \"requesting\r\nhim to delay his voyage till the governor could communicate with him\r\nin person!\" Barba, however, knew that the attempt to seize the leader\r\nof such an enterprise and of such a band, would be vain;--whilst\r\nCortéz, in reply to Velasquez, \"implored his Excellency to rely on his\r\nboundless devotion to the interests of his Governor, but assured him,\r\nnevertheless, that he and his fleet, by divine permission, would sail\r\non the following day!\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 18th of February, 1519, the little squadron\r\nweighed anchor, with one hundred and ten mariners, sixteen horses,\r\nfive hundred and fifty-three soldiers, including thirty-two\r\ncrossbowmen and thirteen arquebusiers, besides two hundred Indians of\r\nthe island and a few native women, for menial offices. The ordnance\r\nconsisted of ten heavy guns, four lighter pieces or falconets,\r\ntogether with a good supply of ammunition.\r\n\r\nWith this insignificant command and paltry equipment, HERNANDO CORTÉZ,\r\nat the age of thirty-three, set sail for the conquest of Mexico. He\r\ninvoked on his enterprise the blessing of his patron, Saint Peter;--he\r\naddressed his followers in the language of encouragement and\r\nresolution;--he unfurled a velvet banner on which was emblazoned the\r\nfigure of a crimson cross amid flames of blue and white, and he\r\npointed to the motto which was to be the presage of victory: \"Friends,\r\nlet us follow the Cross: and under this sign, if we have faith, we\r\nshall conquer!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1525, the gold washings of Hispaniola were already\r\nexhausted; and sugar and hides are alone mentioned as exports. Petri\r\nMart: Ep. 806, Kal. Mart. 1525.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1519.\r\n\r\n    OLMEDO PREACHES TO THE INDIANS.--AGUILAR AND\r\n    MARIANA--INTERPRETERS.--CORTÉZ LANDS--INTERVIEW WITH THE\r\n    AZTECS.--DIPLOMACY--MONTEZUMA'S PRESENTS.--MONTEZUMA REFUSES TO\r\n    RECEIVE CORTÉZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the adventurers departed from the coast of Cuba, the weather,\r\nwhich had been hitherto fine, suddenly changed, and one of those violent\r\nhurricanes which ravage the Indian Isles during the warm season,\r\nscattered and dismantled the small squadron, sweeping it far to the\r\nsouth of its original destination. Cortéz was the last to reach the\r\nIsland of Cozumel, having been forced to linger in order to watch for\r\nthe safety of one of his battered craft. But, immediately on landing, he\r\nwas pained to learn that the impetuous PEDRO DE ALVARADO had rashly\r\nentered the temples, despoiled them of their ornaments, and terrified\r\nthe natives into promiscuous flight. He immediately devoted himself to\r\nthe task of obliterating this stain on Spanish humanity, by kindly\r\nreleasing two of the captives taken by Alvarado. Through an interpreter\r\nhe satisfied them of the pacific purpose of his voyage, and despatched\r\nthem to their homes with valuable gifts. This humane policy appears to\r\nhave succeeded with the natives, who speedily returned from the\r\ninterior, and commenced a brisk traffic of gold for trinkets.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection of Cortéz to the headlong destruction which\r\nAlvarado had committed in the temples, seems rather to have been\r\nagainst the robbery than the religious motive, if such existed in the\r\nbreast of his impetuous companion. We have already said that the\r\nconversion of the heathen was one of the alleged primary objects of\r\nthis expedition, for the instructions of the Governor of Cuba were\r\nfull of zeal for the spread of Christianity; yet, in the diffusion of\r\nthis novel creed among the aborigines, it sometimes happened that its\r\nmilitary propagandists regarded the sword as more powerful than the\r\nsermon. The idolatrous practices of the inhabitants of Cozumel shocked\r\nthe sensibility of the commander, and he set about the work of\r\nchristianization through the labors of the licentiate Juan Diaz and\r\nBartolomé de Olmedo, the latter of whom,--who remained with the army\r\nduring the whole expedition,--was, indeed, a mirror of zeal and\r\ncharity. The discourses of these worthy priests were, however,\r\nunavailing;--the Indians, who of course could not comprehend their\r\neloquent exhortations or pious logic, refused to abandon their idols;\r\nand our hero resolved at once to convince them, by palpable arguments,\r\nof the inefficiency of those hideous emblems, either to save\r\nthemselves from destruction, or to bestow blessings on the blind\r\nadorers. An order was, therefore, forthwith given for the immediate\r\ndestruction of the Indian images; and, in their place, the Virgin and\r\nher Son were erected on a hastily constructed altar. Olmedo and his\r\ncompanion were thus the first to offer the sacrifice of the mass in\r\nNew Spain, where they, finally, induced numbers of the aborigines to\r\nrenounce idolatry and embrace the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this marauding crusade against their property and creed, the\r\nIndians kindly furnished the fleet with provisions, which enabled the\r\nsquadron to sail in the ensuing March. But a leak in one of the vessels\r\ncompelled the adventurers to return to port,--a circumstance which was\r\nregarded by many as providential,--inasmuch as it was the means of\r\nrestoring to his countryman, a Spaniard, named Aguilar, who had been\r\nwrecked on the coast of Yucatan eight years before. The long residence\r\nof this person in the country made him familiar with the language of the\r\ninhabitants of that neighborhood, and thus a valuable interpreter,--one\r\nof its most pressing wants,--was added to the expedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the vessels were refitted, Cortéz coasted the shores of Yucatan\r\nuntil he reached the Rio de Tabasco or Grijalva, where he encountered\r\nthe first serious opposition to the Spanish arms. He had a severe\r\nconflict, in the vicinity of his landing, with a large force of the\r\nnatives; but the valor of his men, the terror inspired by fire arms,\r\nand the singular spectacle presented to the astonished Indians by the\r\nextraordinary appearance of cavalry, soon turned the tide of victory\r\nin his favor. The subdued tribes appeased his anger by valuable gifts,\r\nand forthwith established friendly relations with their dreaded\r\nconqueror. Among the presents offered upon this occasion by the\r\nvanquished, were twenty female slaves;--and after one of the holy\r\nfathers had attempted, as usual, to impress the truths of\r\nchristianity upon the natives, and had closed the ceremonies of the\r\nday by a pompous procession, with all the impressive ceremonial of the\r\nRoman church, the fleet again sailed towards the empire Cortéz was\r\ndestined to penetrate and subdue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Passion week, of the year 1519, the squadron dropped anchor under\r\nthe lee of the Island or reef of St. Juan de Ulua. The natives\r\nimmediately boarded the vessel of the Captain General; but their\r\nlanguage was altogether different from that of the Mayan dialects\r\nspoken in Yucatan and its immediate dependencies. In this emergency\r\nCortéz learned that, among the twenty female slaves who had been\r\nrecently presented him, there was one who knew the Mexican language,\r\nand, in fact, that she was an Aztec by birth. This was the celebrated\r\nMARINA or MARIANA, who accompanied the conqueror throughout his\r\nsubsequent adventures, and was so useful as a sagacious friend and\r\ndiscreet interpreter. Acquainted with the languages of her native land\r\nand of the Yucatecos, she found it easy to translate the idiom of the\r\nAztecs into the Mayan dialect which Aguilar, the Spaniard, had learned\r\nduring his captivity. Through this medium, Cortéz was apprised that\r\nthese Mexicans or Aztecs were the subjects of a powerful sovereign who\r\nruled an empire bounded by two seas, and that his name was MONTEZUMA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April the Captain General landed on the sandy and\r\ndesolate beach whereon is now built the modern city of Vera Cruz.\r\nWithin a few days the native Governor of the province arrived to greet\r\nhim, and expressed great anxiety to learn whence the \"fair and bearded\r\nstrangers\" had come? Cortéz told him that he was the \"subject of a\r\nmighty monarch beyond the sea who ruled over an immense empire and had\r\nkings and princes for his vassals;--that, acquainted with the\r\ngreatness of the Mexican emperor, his master desired to enter into\r\ncommunication with so great a personage, and had sent him, as an\r\nenvoy, to wait on MONTEZUMA with a present in token of his good will,\r\nand a friendly message which he must deliver in person.\" The Indian\r\nGovernor expressed surprise that there was another king as great as\r\nhis master, yet assured Cortéz that as soon as he learned Montezuma's\r\ndetermination, he would again converse with him on the subject.\r\nTEUHTLE then presented the Captain General ten loads of fine cottons;\r\nmantles of curious feather work, beautifully dyed; and baskets filled\r\nwith golden ornaments. Cortéz, in turn, produced the gifts for the\r\nemperor, which were comparatively insignificant; but, when the Aztec\r\nGovernor desired to receive the glittering helmet of one of the men,\r\nit was readily given as an offering to the emperor, with the\r\nsignificant request that it might be returned filled with gold, which\r\nCortéz told him was \"a specific remedy for a disease of the heart with\r\nwhich his countrymen, the Spaniards, were sorely afflicted!\"\r\n\r\nDuring this interview between the functionaries it was noticed by the\r\nadventurers that men were eagerly employed among the Indians in\r\nsketching every thing they beheld in the ranks of the strangers,--for,\r\nby this picture-writing, the Mexican monarch was to be apprised in\r\naccurate detail of the men, horses, ships, armor, force, and weapons\r\nof this motley band of invaders.\r\n\r\nThese pictorial missives were swiftly borne by the Mexican couriers to\r\nthe Aztec capital among the mountains, and, together with the oral\r\naccount of the landing of Cortéz and his demand for an interview, were\r\nlaid before the Imperial Court. It may well be imagined that the\r\nextraordinary advent of the Captain General and his squadron was\r\nproductive of no small degree of excitement and even tremor, among\r\nthis primitive people; for, not only were they unnerved by the dread\r\nwhich all secluded races feel for innovation, but an ancient prophecy\r\nhad foretold the downfall of the empire through the instrumentality of\r\nbeings, who, like these adventurers, were to \"come from the rising\r\nsun.\" Montezuma, who was then on the throne, had been elected to that\r\ndignity in 1502 in preference to his brothers, in consequence of his\r\nsuperior qualifications as a soldier and a priest. His reign commenced\r\nenergetically; and whilst he, at first, administered the interior\r\naffairs of his realm with justice, capacity, and moderation, his hand\r\nfell heavily on all who dared to raise their arms against his people.\r\nBut, as he waxed older and firmer in power, and as his empire\r\nextended, he began to exhibit those selfish traits which so often\r\ncharacterize men who possess, for a length of time, supreme power\r\nuntrammelled by constitutional restraints. His court was sumptuous,\r\nand his people were grievously taxed to support its unbounded\r\nextravagance. This, in some degree, alienated the loyalty of his\r\nsubjects, while continued oppression finally led to frequent\r\ninsurrection. In addition to these internal discontents of the Aztec\r\nempire, Montezuma had met in the nominal republic of Tlascala,--lying\r\nmidway between the valley of Mexico and the seacoast,--a brave and\r\nstubborn foe, whose civilization, unimpaired resources, and martial\r\ncharacter, enabled it to resist the combined forces of the Aztecs for\r\nupwards of two hundred years.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the empire when the news of Cortéz's arrival\r\nbecame the subject of discussion in Mexico. Some were for open or wily\r\nresistance. Others were oppressed with superstitious fears. But\r\nMontezuma, adopting a medium but fatal course, resolved, without\r\ndelay, to send an embassy with such gifts as he imagined would impress\r\nthe strangers with the idea of his magnificence and power, whilst, at\r\nthe same time, he courteously commanded the adventurers to refrain\r\nfrom approaching his capital.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Spaniards restlessly endured the scorching heats and\r\nmanifold annoyances of the coast, and were amusing themselves by a\r\npaltry traffic with the Indians, whose offerings were generally of but\r\ntrifling value. After the expiration of a week, however, the returned\r\ncouriers and the embassy approached the camp. The time is seemingly\r\nshort when we consider the difficulty of transportation through a\r\nmountain country, and recollect that the Mexicans, who were without\r\nhorses, had been obliged to traverse the distance on foot. But it is\r\nrelated on ample authority,--so perfectly were the posts arranged\r\namong these semi-civilized people,--that tidings were borne in the\r\nshort period of twenty-four hours from the city to the sea, and,\r\nconsequently, that three or four days were ample for the journey of\r\nthe envoys of Montezuma, upon a matter of so much national importance.\r\n\r\nThe two Aztec nobles, accompanied by the Governor of the province,\r\nTeuhtle, did not approach with empty hands the men whom they hoped to\r\nbribe if they could not intimidate. Gold and native fabrics of the\r\nmost delicate character; shields, helmets, cuirasses, collars,\r\nbracelets, sandals, fans, pearls, precious stones; loads of cotton\r\ncloth, extraordinary manufactures of feathers, circular plates of gold\r\nand silver as large as carriage wheels, and the Spanish helmet filled\r\nwith golden grains; were all spread out, as a free gift from the\r\nEmperor to the Spaniards!\r\n\r\nWith these magnificent presents, Montezuma replied to the request of\r\nCortéz, that it would give him pleasure to communicate with so mighty\r\na monarch as the king of Spain, whom he respected highly, but that he\r\ncould not gratify himself by according the foreign envoy a personal\r\ninterview, inasmuch as the distance to his capital was great, and the\r\ntoilsome journey among the mountains was beset with dangers from\r\nformidable enemies. He could do no more, therefore, than bid the\r\nstrangers farewell, and request them to return to their homes over\r\nthe sea with these proofs of his perfect friendship.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that this naïve system of diplomacy could have\r\nbut little effect on men who were bent on improving their fortunes,\r\nand whose rapacity was only stimulated by the evidences of unbounded\r\nwealth which the simple-minded king had so lavishly bestowed on them.\r\nMontezuma was the dupe of his own credulity, and only inflamed, by the\r\nvery means he imagined would assuage the avarice or ambition of his\r\nSpanish visitors. Nor was Cortéz less resolved than his companions.\r\nAccordingly he made another pacific effort, by means of additional\r\npresents and a gentle message, to change the resolution of the Indian\r\nemperor. Still the Aztec sovereign was obstinate in his refusal of a\r\npersonal interview, although he sent fresh gifts by the persons who\r\nbore to the Spaniards his polite but firm and peremptory denial.\r\n\r\nCortéz could hardly conceal his disappointment at this second rebuff;\r\nbut, as the vesper bell tolled, whilst the ambassadors were in his\r\npresence, he threw himself on his knees with his soldiers, and, after\r\na prayer, Father Olmedo expounded to the Aztec chiefs, by his\r\ninterpreters, the doctrines of Christianity, and putting into their\r\nhands an image of the Virgin and Saviour, he exhorted them to abandon\r\ntheir hideous idolatry, and to place these milder emblems of faith and\r\nhope on the altars of their bloody gods. That very night the Indians\r\nabandoned the Spanish camp and the neighborhood, leaving the\r\nadventurers without the copious supplies of food that hitherto had\r\nbeen bountifully furnished. Cortéz, nevertheless, was undismayed by\r\nthese menacing symptoms, and exclaimed to his hardy followers: \"It\r\nshall yet go hard, but we will one day pay this powerful prince a\r\nvisit in his gorgeous capital!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1519.\r\n\r\n    CORTÉZ FOUNDS LA VILLA RICA DE LA VERA CRUZ.--FLEET\r\n    DESTROYED--MARCH TO MEXICO.--CONQUEST OF\r\n    TLASCALA--CHOLULA.--SLAUGHTER IN CHOLULA--VALLEY OF\r\n    MEXICO.--CORTÉZ ENTERS THE VALLEY--GIGANTIC CAUSEWAY.--LAKE OF\r\n    TEZCOCO--RECEPTION BY MONTEZUMA.--SPANIARDS ENTER THE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in a work like the present, which is designed to\r\ncover the history of a country during three hundred years, to present\r\nthe reader with as complete a narrative of events as we would desire.\r\nHappily, the task of recording the story of the conquest, has fallen\r\ninto the hands of the classic historians of Spain, England and\r\nAmerica; and the astonishing particulars of that mighty enterprise may\r\nbe found, minutely recounted, in the works of De Solis, Robertson and\r\nPrescott. We shall therefore content ourselves with as rapid a summary\r\nas is consistent with the development of the modern Mexican character,\r\nand shall refer those who are anxious for more explicit and perfect\r\ndetails to the writings of the authors we have mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortéz was not long idle after the withdrawal of the Aztec emissaries\r\nand the surly departure of the Indians, who, as we have related in the\r\nlast chapter, quitted his camp and neighborhood on the same night with\r\nthe ambassadors of Montezuma. He forthwith proceeded to establish a\r\nmilitary and civil colony, of which he became Captain General and Chief\r\nJustice; he founded the Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz in order to secure a\r\nbase on the coast for future military operation, by means of which he\r\nmight be independent of Velasquez; and he formed an alliance with the\r\nTotonacos of Cempoalla, whose loyalty,--though they were subjects of\r\nMontezuma,--was alienated from him by his merciless exactions. We shall\r\nnot dwell upon the skill with which he fomented a breach between the\r\nTotonacos and the ambassadors of Montezuma, nor upon the valuable gifts,\r\nand discreet despatches he forwarded to the Emperor Charles V., in\r\norder to secure a confirmation of his proceedings. The most daring act\r\nof this period was the destruction of the squadron which had wafted him\r\nto Mexico. It was a deed of wise policy, which deliberately cut off all\r\nhope of retreat,--pacified, in some degree, the querulous conspirators\r\nwho lurked in his camp,--and placed before all who were embarked in the\r\nenterprise the alternative of conquest or destruction. But one vessel\r\nremained. Nine out of the ten were dismantled and sunk. When his men\r\nmurmured for a moment, and imagined themselves betrayed, he addressed\r\nthem in that language of bland diplomacy which he was so well skilled to\r\nuse whenever the occasion required. \"As for me,\" said he, \"I will remain\r\n_here_ whilst there is one to bear me company! Let the cravens shrink\r\nfrom danger and go home in the single vessel that remains. Let them\r\nhasten to Cuba, and relate how they deserted their commander and\r\ncomrades; and there let them wait in patience till we return laden with\r\nthe spoils of Mexico!\"\r\n\r\nThis was an appeal that rekindled the combined enthusiasm and avarice\r\nof the despondent murmurers; and the reply was a universal shout: \"TO\r\nMEXICO! TO MEXICO!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August, 1519, Cortéz set out with his small army of about\r\nfour hundred men, now swelled by the addition of thirteen hundred Indian\r\nwarriors and a thousand porters, and accompanied by forty of the chief\r\nTotonacs as hostages and advisers. From the burning climate of the coast\r\nthe army gradually ascended to the cooler regions of the _tierra\r\ntemplada_, and _tierra fria_, encountering all degrees of temperature on\r\nthe route. After a journey of three days, the forces arrived at a town\r\non one of the table lands of the interior, whose chief magistrate\r\nconfirmed the stories of the power of Montezuma. Here Cortéz tarried\r\nthree days for repose, and then proceeded towards the Republic of\r\nTlascala, which lay directly in his path, and with whose inhabitants he\r\nhoped to form an alliance founded on the elements of discontent which he\r\nknew existed among these inveterate foes of the central Aztec power. But\r\nhe was mistaken in his calculations. The Tlascalans were not so easily\r\nwon as his allies, the Totonacs, who, dwelling in a warmer climate, had\r\nnot the hardier virtues of these mountaineers. The Tlascalans\r\nentertained no favorable feeling towards Montezuma, but they nourished\r\nquite as little cordiality for men whose characters they did not know,\r\nand whose purposes they had cause to dread. A deadly hostility to the\r\nSpaniards was consequently soon manifested. Cortéz was attacked by them\r\non the borders of their Republic, and fought four sharp battles with\r\nfifty thousand warriors who maintained, in all the conflicts, their\r\nreputation for military skill and hardihood. At length the Tlascalans\r\nwere forced to acknowledge the superiority of the invaders, whom they\r\ncould not overcome either by stratagem or battle, and, after the\r\nexchange of embassies and gifts, they honored our hero with a triumphal\r\nentry into their capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe news of these victories as well as of the fatal alliance which\r\nensued with the Tlascalans, was soon borne to the court of Montezuma,\r\nwho began to tremble for the fate of his empire when he saw the fall of\r\nthe indomitable foes who had held him so long at bay. Two embassies to\r\nCortéz succeeded each other, in vain. Presents were no longer of avail.\r\nHis offer of tribute to the Spanish king was not listened to. All\r\nrequests that the conqueror should not advance towards his capital were\r\nunheeded. \"The command of his own emperor,\" said Cortéz, \"was the only\r\nreason which could induce him to disregard the wishes of an Aztec\r\nprince, for whom he cherished the profoundest respect!\" Soon after,\r\nanother embassy came from Montezuma with magnificent gifts and an\r\ninvitation to his capital, yet with a request that he would break with\r\nhis new allies and approach Mexico through the friendly city of Cholula.\r\nThe policy of this request on the part of Montezuma, will be seen in the\r\nsequel. Our hero, accompanied by six thousand volunteers from Tlascala,\r\nadvanced towards the sacred city,--the site of the most splendid temple\r\nin the empire, whose foundations yet remain in the nineteenth century.\r\nThe six intervening leagues were soon crossed, and he entered Cholula\r\nwith his Spanish army, attended by no other Indians than those who\r\naccompanied him from Cempoalla. At first, the General and his companions\r\nwere treated hospitably, and the suspicions which had been instilled\r\ninto his mind by the Tlascalans were lulled to sleep. However, he soon\r\nhad cause to become fearful of treachery. Messengers arrived from\r\nMontezuma, and his entertainers were observed to be less gracious in\r\ntheir demeanor. It was noticed that several important streets had been\r\nbarricaded or converted into pitfalls, whilst stones, missiles and\r\nweapons were heaped on the flat roofs of houses. Besides this, Mariana\r\nhad become intimate with the wife of one of the Caciques, and cunningly\r\ndrew from her gossiping friend the whole conspiracy that was brewing\r\nagainst the adventurers. Montezuma, she learned, had stationed twenty\r\nthousand Mexicans near the city, who, together with the Cholulans, were\r\nto assault the invaders in the narrow streets and avenues, as they\r\nquitted the town; and, thus, he hoped, by successful treachery, to rid\r\nthe land of such dangerous visitors either by slaughter in conflict, or\r\nto offer them, when made captive, upon the altars of the sacred temple\r\nin Cholula and on the _teocallis_ of Mexico, as proper sacrifices to the\r\nbloody gods of his country.\r\n\r\nCortéz, however, was not to be so easily outwitted and entrapped. He,\r\nin turn, resorted to stratagem. Concentrating all his Spanish army,\r\nand concerting a signal for co-operation with his Indian allies, he\r\nsuddenly fell upon the Cholulans at an unexpected moment. Three\r\nthousand of the citizens perished in the frightful massacre that\r\nensued; and Cortéz pursued his uninterrupted way towards the fated\r\ncapital of the Aztecs, after this awful chastisement, which was\r\nperhaps needful to relieve him from the danger of utter annihilation\r\nin the heart of an enemy's country with so small a band of countrymen\r\nin whom he could confide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the plain of Cholula,--which is now known as the fruitful vale of\r\nPuebla,--the conqueror ascended the last ridge of mountains that\r\nseparated him from the city of Mexico; and, as he turned the edge of\r\nthe _Cordillera_, the beautiful valley was at once revealed to him in\r\nall its indescribable loveliness.[2] It lay at his feet, surrounded by\r\nthe placid waters of Tezcoco. The sight that burst upon the Spaniards\r\nfrom this lofty eminence, in the language of Prescott, was that of the\r\nvale of Tenochtitlan, as it was called by the natives, \"which, with\r\nits picturesque assemblage of water, woodland, and cultivated plains;\r\nits shining cities and shadowy hills, was spread out like some gay and\r\ngorgeous panorama before them. In the highly rarefied atmosphere of\r\nthese upper regions, even remote objects have a brilliancy of coloring\r\nand a distinctness of outline which seems to annihilate distance.\r\nStretching far away at their feet, were seen noble forests of oak,\r\nsycamore, and cedar; and beyond, yellow fields of maize and the\r\ntowering maguey, intermingled with orchards and blooming gardens; for\r\nflowers, in such demand for their religious festivals, were even more\r\nabundant in this populous valley, than in other parts of Anahuac. In\r\nthe centre of the great basin, were beheld the lakes, occupying then a\r\nmuch larger portion of its surface than at present; their borders\r\nthickly studded with towns and hamlets, and, in the midst,--like some\r\nIndian empress with her coronal of pearls,--the fair city of Mexico,\r\nwith her white towers and pyramidal temples reposing, as it were, on\r\nthe bosom of the waters--the far-famed 'Venice of the Aztecs.' High\r\nover all rose the royal hill of Chapultepec, the residence of the\r\nMexican monarchs, belted with the same grove of gigantic cypresses,\r\nwhich at this day fling their broad shadows over the land. In the\r\ndistance, to the north, beyond the blue waters of the lake, and nearly\r\nscreened by intervening foliage, was seen a shining speck, the rival\r\ncapital of Tezcoco; and, still further on, the dark belt of porphyry,\r\ngirdling the valley around, like a rich setting which Nature had\r\ndevised for the fairest of her jewels.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortéz easily descended with his troops by the mountain road towards\r\nthe plain of the valley; and as he passed along the levels, or through\r\nthe numerous villages and hamlets, he endeavored to foster and foment\r\nthe ill feeling which he found secretly existing against the\r\ngovernment of the Mexican Emperor. When he had advanced somewhat into\r\nthe heart of the valley he was met by an embassy of the chief lords of\r\nthe Aztec court, sent to him by Montezuma, with gifts of considerable\r\nvalue; but he rejected a proffered bribe of \"four loads of gold to the\r\nGeneral, and one to each of his captains, with a yearly tribute to\r\ntheir sovereign,\" provided the Spanish troops would quit the country.\r\nHeedless of all menaced opposition as well as appeals to his avarice,\r\nhe seems, at this period, to have cast aside the earlier and sordid\r\nmotives which might then have been easily satisfied had his pursuit\r\nbeen gold alone. The most abundant wealth was cast at his feet; but\r\nthe higher qualities of his nature were now allowed the fullest play,\r\nand strengthened him in his resolution to risk all in the daring and\r\nglorious project of subjecting a splendid empire to his control.\r\nAccordingly, he advanced though Amaquemecan, a town of several\r\nthousand inhabitants, where he was met by a nephew of the Emperor, the\r\nLord of Tezcoco, who had been despatched by his vacillating uncle, at\r\nthe head of a large number of influential personages, to welcome the\r\ninvaders to the capital. The friendly summons was of course not\r\ndisregarded by Cortéz, who forthwith proceeded along the most splendid\r\nand massive structure of the New World--a gigantic causeway, five\r\nmiles in length, constructed of huge stones, which passed along the\r\nnarrow strait of sand that separated the waters of Chalco from those\r\nof Tezcoco. The lakes were covered with boats filled with natives.\r\nFloating islands, made of reeds and wicker-work, covered with soil,\r\nbrimmed with luxuriant vegetation whose splendid fruits and odorous\r\npetals rested on the waters. Several large towns were built on\r\nartificial foundations in the lake. And, every where, around the\r\nSpaniards, were beheld the evidences of a dense population, whose\r\nedifices, agriculture, and labors denoted a high degree of\r\ncivilization and intelligence. As the foreign warriors proceeded\r\nonwards towards the city, which rose before them with its temples,\r\npalaces and shrines, covered with hard stucco that glistened in the\r\nsun, they crossed a wooden drawbridge in the causeway; and, as they\r\npassed it, they felt that now, indeed, if they faltered, they were\r\ncompletely in the grasp of the Mexicans, and more effectually cut off\r\nfrom all retreat than they had been when the fleet was destroyed at\r\nVera Cruz.\r\n\r\nNear this spot they were encountered by Montezuma with his court, who\r\ncame forth in regal state to salute his future conqueror. Surrounded\r\nby all the pageantry and splendor of an oriental monarch, he descended\r\nfrom the litter in which he was borne from the city, and, leaning on\r\nthe shoulders of the Lords of Tezcoco and of Iztapalapan,--his nephew\r\nand brother,--he advanced towards the Spaniards, under a canopy and\r\nover a cotton carpet, whilst his prostrate subjects manifested, by\r\ntheir abject demeanor, the fear or respect which the presence of their\r\nsovereign inspired.\r\n\r\n\"Montezuma was at this time about forty years of age. His person was\r\ntall and slender, but not ill-made. His hair, which was black and\r\nstraight, was not very long. His beard was thin; his complexion\r\nsomewhat paler than is often found in his dusky, or rather\r\ncopper-colored race. His features, though serious in their expression,\r\ndid not wear the look of melancholy, or dejection, which characterizes\r\nhis portrait, and which may well have settled on them at a later\r\nperiod. He moved with dignity, and his whole demeanor, tempered by an\r\nexpression of benignity not to have been anticipated from the reports\r\ncirculated of his character, was worthy of a great prince. Such is the\r\npicture left to us of the celebrated Indian Emperor in this his first\r\ninterview with the white men.\"[3]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs this mighty prince approached, Cortéz halted his men, and,\r\nadvancing with a few of his principal retainers, was most courteously\r\nwelcomed by Montezuma, who, adroitly concealing his chagrin,\r\ndiplomatically expressed the uncommon delight he experienced at this\r\nunexpected visit of the strangers to his capital. Our hero thanked\r\nhim for his friendly welcome and bounteous gifts,--and hung around his\r\nneck a chain set with colored crystal. Montezuma then opened his gates\r\nto the Spaniards and appointed his brother to conduct the General with\r\nhis troops, to the city.\r\n\r\nHere he found a spacious edifice, surrounded by a wall, assigned for\r\nhis future residence; and, having stationed sentinels, and placed his\r\ncannon on the battlements so as to command all the important avenues\r\nto his palace, he proceeded to examine the city and to acquaint\r\nhimself with the character, occupations, and temper of the people.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Between nine and ten thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea, at this point of the road.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Prescott.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"The province which constitutes the principal territory\r\nof Montezuma,\" (says Cortéz in his letter to Charles the V.,) \"is\r\ncircular, and entirely surrounded by lofty and rugged mountains, and\r\nthe circumference of it is full seventy leagues. In this plain there\r\nare two lakes which nearly occupy the whole of it, as the people use\r\ncanoes for more than fifty leagues round. One of these lakes is of\r\nfresh water, and the other, which is larger, is of salt water. They\r\nare divided, on one side, by a small collection of high hills, which\r\nstand in the centre of the plain, and they unite in a level strait\r\nformed between these hills and the high mountains, which strait is a\r\ngun-shot wide, and the people of the cities and other settlements\r\nwhich are in these lakes, communicate together in their canoes by\r\nwater, without the necessity of going by land. And as this great salt\r\nlake ebbs and flows with the tide, as the sea does, in every flood the\r\nwater flows from it into the other fresh lake as impetuously as if it\r\nwere a large river, and consequently at the ebb, the fresh lake flows\r\ninto the salt.\r\n\r\n\"This great city of Temixtitlan, (meaning Tenochtitlan, Mexico,) is\r\nfounded in this salt lake; and from terra firma to the body of the city,\r\nthe distance is two leagues on whichever side they please to enter it.\r\n\r\n\"It has four entrances, or causeways, made by the hand of man, as wide\r\nas two horsemen's lances.\r\n\r\n\"The city is as large as Seville and Cordova. The streets (I mean the\r\nprincipal ones,) are very wide, and others very narrow; and some of\r\nthe latter and all the others are one-half land and the other half\r\nwater, along which the inhabitants go in their canoes; and all the\r\nstreets, at given distances, are open, so that the water passes from\r\none to the other; and in all their openings, some of which are very\r\nwide, there are very wide bridges, made of massive beams joined\r\ntogether and well wrought; and so wide that ten horsemen may pass\r\nabreast over many of them.\"--_Letters of Cortéz to Charles V._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1519-1520.\r\n\r\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE CITY OF TENOCHTITLAN.--MONTEZUMA'S WAY OF\r\n    LIFE--MARKET-PLACE.--CORTÉZ AT THE GREAT TEMPLE--DESCRIPTION OF\r\n    IT.--PLACE OF SACRIFICE--SANCTUARIES--HUITZILOPOTCHTLI.--\r\n    TEZCATLIPOCA--DANGER OF CORTÉZ--MONTEZUMA SEIZED.--MONTEZUMA A\r\n    PRISONER--HIS SUBMISSIVENESS.--ARRIVAL OF NARVAEZ--CORTÉZ'S\r\n    DIPLOMACY.--CORTÉZ OVERCOMES NARVAEZ, AND RECRUITS HIS FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Mexico, or Tenochtitlan, was, as we have already said,\r\nencompassed by the lake of Tezcoco, over which three solid causeways\r\nformed the only approaches. This inland sea was, indeed, \"an\r\narchipelago of wandering islands.\" The whole city was penetrated\r\nthroughout its entire length by a principal street, which was\r\nintersected by numerous canals, crossed by drawbridges; and, wherever\r\nthe eye could reach, long vistas of low stone buildings rose on every\r\nside among beautiful gardens or luxuriant foliage. The quadrangular\r\npalaces of the nobles who Montezuma encouraged to reside at his court,\r\nwere spread over a wide extent of ground, embellished with beautiful\r\nfountains which shot their spray amid porticoes and columns of\r\npolished porphyry. The palace of Montezuma was so vast a pile, that\r\none of the conquerors alleges its terraced roof afforded ample room\r\nfor thirty knights to tilt in tournament. A royal armory was filled\r\nwith curious and dangerous weapons, and adorned with an ample store of\r\nmilitary dresses, equipments and armor. Huge granaries contained the\r\ntributary supplies which were brought to the Prince by the provinces\r\nfor the maintenance of the royal family, and there was an aviary in\r\nwhich three hundred attendants fed and reared birds of the sweetest\r\nvoice or rarest plumage; whilst, near it, rose a menagerie, filled\r\nwith specimens of all the native beasts, together with a museum, in\r\nwhich, with an oddity of taste unparalleled in history, there had been\r\ncollected a vast number of human monsters, cripples, dwarfs, Albinos\r\nand other freaks and caprices of nature. The royal gardens are\r\ndescribed by eye-witnesses as spots of unsurpassed elegance, adorned\r\nwith rare shrubs, medicinal plants, and ponds, supplied by aqueducts\r\nand fountains, wherein, amid beautiful flowers, the finest fish and\r\naquatic birds were seen forever floating in undisturbed quiet. The\r\ninterior of the palace was equally attractive for its comfort and\r\nelegance. Spacious halls were covered with ceilings of odoriferous\r\nwood, while the lofty walls were hung with richly tinted fabrics of\r\ncotton, the skins of animals, or feather work wrought in mosaic\r\nimitation of birds, reptiles, insects and flowers. Nor was the Emperor\r\nalone amid the splendid wastes of his palace. A thousand women\r\nthronged these royal chambers, ministering to the tastes and passions\r\nof the elegant voluptuary. The rarest viands, from far and near,\r\nsupplied his table, the service of which was performed by numerous\r\nattendants on utensils and equipage of the choicest material and\r\nshape. Four times, daily, the Emperor changed his apparel, and never\r\nput on again the dress he once had worn, or defiled his lips twice\r\nwith the same vessels from which he fed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sovereign's palace and way of life, nor can we suppose that\r\nthis refinement of luxury was to be found alone in the dwelling of\r\nMontezuma and his nobles. It is to be regretted that we are not more\r\nfully informed of the condition of property, wealth and labor among the\r\nmasses of this singular empire. The conquerors did not trouble\r\nthemselves with acquiring accurate statistical information, nor do they\r\nseem to have counted numbers carefully, except when they had enemies to\r\nconquer or spoil to divide. In all primitive nations, however, the best\r\nidea of a people is to be attained from visiting the market-place,--or\r\nrather the fair,--in which it is their custom to sell or barter the\r\nproducts of their industry; and, to this rendezvous of the Aztecs,\r\nCortéz, with the astuteness that never forsook him during his perilous\r\nenterprise, soon betook himself after his arrival in the city.\r\n\r\nThe market of Tenochtitlan was a scene of commercial activity as well as\r\nof humble thrift. It was devoted to all kinds of native traffic. In the\r\ncentre of the city the conqueror found a magnificent square surrounded\r\nby porticoes, in which, it is alleged, that sixty thousand traders were\r\nengaged in buying and selling every species of merchandize produced in\r\nthe realm; jewels, goldware, toys, curious imitations of natural\r\nobjects, wrought with the utmost skill of deception; weapons of copper\r\nalloyed with tin, pottery of all degrees of fineness, carved vases,\r\nbales of richly dyed cotton; beautifully woven feather-work, wild and\r\ntame animals, grain, fish, vegetables, all the necessaries of life and\r\nall its luxuries, together with restaurateurs and shops for the sale of\r\nmedical drugs, confectionery, or stimulating drinks. It was, in fact, an\r\nimmense bazaar, which, at a glance, gave an insight into the tastes,\r\nwants and productive industry of the nation.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this inspection of the people and their talents, the\r\nnext visit of the General was, doubtless, made with the double object\r\nof becoming acquainted with that class of men, who in all countries so\r\npowerfully influence public opinion, whilst, from the top of their\r\ntall temple, situated on their lofty central Teocalli or pyramid, he\r\nmight, with a military eye, scan the general topography of the city.\r\n\r\nThis pyramidal structure, or Great Temple, as it is generally called,\r\nwas perhaps rather the base of a religious structure, than the\r\nreligious edifice itself. We possess no accurate drawing of it among\r\nthe contemporary or early relics of the conquest, that have descended\r\nto us; but it is known to have been pyramidal in shape, over one\r\nhundred and twenty feet in altitude, with a base of three hundred and\r\ntwenty. It stood in a large area, surrounded by a wall eight feet\r\nhigh, sculptured with the figures of serpents in relief. From one end\r\nof the base of this structure, a flight of steps rose to a terrace at\r\nthe base of the second story of the pyramid. Around this terrace, a\r\nperson, in ascending, was obliged to pass until he came to the corner\r\nimmediately above the first flight, where he encountered another set\r\nof steps, up which he passed to the second terrace, and so on,\r\ncontinuously, to the third and fourth terraces, until, by a fifth\r\nflight, he attained the summit platform of the Teocalli. These spaces\r\nor terraces, at each story, are represented to have been about six\r\nfeet in width, so that three or four persons could easily ascend\r\nabreast. It will be perceived that in attaining the top of the edifice\r\nit was necessary to pass round it entirely four times and to ascend\r\nfive stairways. Within the enclosure, built of stone and crowned with\r\nbattlements, a village of five hundred houses might have been built.\r\nIts area was paved with smooth and polished stones, and the pyramid\r\nthat rose in its centre seems to have been constructed as well for\r\nmilitary as religious purposes, inasmuch as its architecture made it\r\nfully capable of resistance as a citadel; and we may properly assume\r\nthis opinion as a fact, from the circumstance that the enclosing walls\r\nwere entered by four gates, facing the cardinal points, while over\r\neach portal was erected a military arsenal filled with immense stores\r\nof warlike equipments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESTORATION OF GREAT TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\nWhen Cortéz arrived in front of this truncated pyramid, two priests\r\nand several caciques were in attendance, by order of Montezuma, to\r\nbear him in their arms to its summit. But the hardy conqueror declined\r\nthis effeminate means of transportation, and marched up slowly at the\r\nhead of his soldiers. On the paved and level area at the top, they\r\nfound a large block of jasper, the peculiar shape of which showed it\r\nwas the stone on which the bodies of the unhappy victims were\r\nstretched for sacrifice. Its convex surface, rising breast high,\r\nenabled the priest to perform more easily his diabolical task of\r\nremoving the heart. Besides this, there were two sanctuaries erected\r\non the level surface of the _Teocalli_; two altars, glowing with a\r\nfire that was never extinguished; and a large circular drum, which was\r\nstruck only on occasions of great public concern.\r\n\r\nSuch was the _Teocalli_ or _House of God_. There were other edifices,\r\nhaving the name of _Teopan_, or _Places of God_. Some writers allege\r\nthat there were two towers erected on the great Teocalli of\r\nTenochtitlan; but it may be safely asserted that there was at least\r\none of these, which rose to the height of about fifty-six feet, and\r\nwas divided into three stories, the lower being of stone, while the\r\nothers were constructed of wrought and painted wood. In the basement\r\nof these towers were the sanctuaries, where two splendid altars had\r\nbeen erected to Huitzilopotchtli and Tezcatlipoca, over which the idol\r\nrepresentatives of these divinities were placed in state.\r\n\r\nWithin the enclosure of the Teocalli there were forty other temples\r\ndedicated to various Aztec gods. Besides these, there were colleges or\r\nresidences and seminaries of the priests, together with a splendid\r\nhouse of entertainment, devoted to the accommodation of eminent\r\nstrangers who visited the temple and the court. All these sumptuous\r\necclesiastical establishments were grouped around the pyramid,\r\nprotected by the quadrangular wall, and built amid gardens and groves.\r\n\r\nCortéz asked leave of the Emperor, who accompanied him on his visit, to\r\nenter the sanctuaries of the Aztec deities. In a spacious stuccoed\r\nsaloon, roofed with carved and gilt timber, stood the gigantic idol of\r\nHuitzilopotchtli, the Mexican Mars. His countenance was harsh and\r\nmenacing. In his hands he grasped a bow and golden arrows. He was girt\r\nwith the folds of a serpent, formed of precious materials, whilst his\r\nleft foot was feathered with the plumage of the humming-bird, from which\r\nhe took his name. Around his throat hung suspended a massive necklace\r\nof alternate gold and silver hearts; and on the altar before him, three\r\nhuman hearts which had recently been torn from living breasts, were\r\nstill quivering and bleeding, fresh from the immolated victims.\r\n\r\nIn the other chamber, or sanctuary, were the milder emblems of\r\nTezcatlipoca, who \"created the world and watched it with providential\r\ncare.\" The lineaments of this idol were those of a youth, whose image,\r\ncarved in black and polished stone, was adorned with discs of burnished\r\ngold, and embellished with a brilliant shield. Nevertheless, the worship\r\nof this more benign deity was stained with homicide, for on its altar,\r\nin a plate of gold, the conqueror found five human hearts; and, in these\r\ndens of inhumanity, Bernal Diaz tells us, that the \"stench was more\r\nintolerable than in the slaughter houses of Castile!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief summary of the observations made by the Spaniards during\r\na week's residence in the city. They found themselves in the heart of a\r\nrich and populous empire, whose civilization, however, was, by a strange\r\ncontradiction for which we shall hereafter endeavor to account, stained\r\nwith the most shocking barbarity under the name of religion. The\r\nunscrupulous murder, which was dignified with the associations and\r\npractice of national worship, was by no means consolatory to the minds\r\nof men who were really in the power of semi-civilized rulers and bloody\r\npriests. They discovered, from their own experience, that the sovereign\r\nwas both fickle and feeble, and that a caprice, a hope, or a fear, might\r\nsuffice to make him free his country from a handful of dangerous guests\r\nby offering them as sacrifices to his gods. The Tlascalans were already\r\nlooked upon with no kind feelings by their hereditary foes. A spark\r\nmight kindle a fatal flame. It was a moment for bold and unscrupulous\r\naction, and it was needful to obtain some signal advantage by which the\r\nSpaniards could, at least, effect their retreat, if not ensure an\r\nultimate victory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNews just then was brought to Cortéz that four of his countrymen, whom\r\nhe left behind at Cempoalla, had been treacherously slain by one of the\r\ntributary caciques of Montezuma; and this at once gave him a motive, or\r\nat least a pretext, for seizing the Emperor himself, as a hostage for\r\nthe good faith of his nation. Accordingly, he visited Montezuma with a\r\nband of his most reliable followers, who charged the monarch with the\r\ntreachery of his subordinate, and demanded the apprehension of the\r\ncacique to answer for the slaughter of their inoffensive countrymen.\r\nMontezuma, of course, immediately disavowed the treason and ordered the\r\narrest of the Governor; but Cortéz would not receive an apology or\r\nverbal reparation of the injury,--although he professed to believe the\r\nexculpation of Montezuma himself,--unless that sovereign would restore\r\nthe Spaniard's confidence in his fidelity by quitting his palace and\r\nchanging his residence to the quarters of the invaders!\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, an unexpected blow. It was one of those strokes of\r\nunparalleled boldness which paralyzed their victim by sheer amazement.\r\nAfter considerable discussion and useless appeals, the entrapped\r\nEmperor tamely submitted to the surprising demand, for he saw, in the\r\nresolved faces of his armed and steel-clad foes, that resistance was\r\nuseless, if he attempted to save his own life, with the small and\r\nunprepared forces that were at hand.\r\n\r\nFor a while the most ceremonious respect was paid by the conqueror and\r\nhis men to their royal prisoner, who, under strict _surveillance_,\r\nmaintained his usual courtly pomp, and performed all the functions of\r\nEmperor. But Cortéz soon became his master. The will of an effeminate\r\nking was no match for the indomitable courage, effrontery and genius\r\nof the Spanish knight. The offending cacique of Cempoalla was burned\r\nalive, either to glut his vengeance or inspire dread; and when the\r\ntraitor endeavored to compromise Montezuma in his crime, fetters were\r\nplaced for an hour on the limbs of the imprisoned sovereign. Every day\r\nthe disgraced Emperor became, more and more, the mere minister of\r\nCortéz. He was forced to discountenance publicly those who murmured at\r\nhis confinement, or to arrest the leading conspirators for his\r\ndeliverance. He granted a province to the Castilian crown and swore\r\nallegiance to it. He collected the tribute and revenue from dependant\r\ncities or districts in the name of the Spanish king; and, at last,\r\nstruck a blow even at his hereditary and superstitious faith by\r\nordering the great Teocalli to be purged of its human gore and the\r\nerection of an altar on its summit, on which, before the cross and the\r\nimages of the Virgin and her Son, the Christian mass might be\r\ncelebrated in the presence of the Aztec multitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, when Cortéz tried the national nerve most\r\ndaringly by interfering with the religious superstitions of a\r\ndissatisfied town, and when every symptom of a general rebellion was\r\nvisible, that the conqueror received the startling news of the arrival\r\non the coast of DON PAMPHILO DE NARVAEZ, with eighteen vessels and\r\nnine hundred men, who had been sent, by the revengeful Velasquez, to\r\narrest the hero and send him in chains to St. Jago.\r\n\r\nA more unfortunate train of circumstances can scarcely be conceived. In\r\nthe midst of an enemy's capital, with a handful of men,--menaced by a\r\nnumerous and outraged nation, on the one hand, and, with a Spanish force\r\nsent, in the name of law by authorities to whom he owed loyal respect,\r\nto arrest him, on the other,--it is indeed difficult to imagine a\r\nsituation better calculated to try the soul and task the genius of a\r\ngeneral. But it was one of those perilous emergencies which, throughout\r\nhis whole career, seem to have imparted additional energy, rather than\r\ndismay, to the heart of Cortéz, and which prove him to have been, like\r\nNelson, a man who never knew the sensation of fear. Nor must it be\r\nimagined that difficulty made him rash. Seldom has a hero appeared in\r\nhistory more perfectly free from precipitancy after he undertook his\r\ngreat enterprise;--and, in the period under consideration, this is fully\r\nexhibited in the diplomacy with which he approached the hostile\r\nSpaniards on the coast who had been despatched to dislodge and disgrace\r\nhim. He resolved, at once, not to abandon what he had already gained in\r\nthe capital; but, at the same time, he endeavored to tranquilize or foil\r\nNarvaez if he could not win him over to his enterprise; for it was\r\nevidently the policy of the newly arrived general to unite in a spoil\r\nwhich was almost ready for division rather than to incur the perils and\r\nuncertainty of another conquest.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Cortéz addressed a letter to Narvaez requesting him not to\r\nkindle a spirit of insubordination among the natives by proclaiming\r\nhis enmity. Yet this failed to affect his jealous countryman. He then\r\ndesired Narvaez to receive his band as brothers in arms, and to share\r\nthe treasure and fame of the conquest. But this, also, was rejected;\r\nwhile the loyal tool of Velasquez diligently applied himself to\r\nfomenting the Aztec discontent against his countrymen, and proclaimed\r\nhis design of marching to Mexico to release the Emperor from the grasp\r\nof his Spanish oppressor.\r\n\r\nThere was now no other opening for diplomacy, nor was delay to be\r\nlonger suffered. Cortéz, therefore, leaving the mutinous capital in\r\nthe hands of Pedro de Alvarado, with a band of but one hundred and\r\nfifty men to protect the treasure he had amassed,--departed for the\r\nshores of the Gulf with only seventy soldiers, but was joined, on his\r\nway, by one hundred and twenty men who had retreated from the garrison\r\nat Vera Cruz. He was not long in traversing the plains and Cordilleras\r\ntowards the eastern sea; and falling suddenly on the camp of Narvaez,\r\nin the dead of night, he turned the captured artillery against his\r\nfoe, seized the general, received the capitulation of the army of nine\r\nhundred well equipped men, and soon healed the factions which of\r\ncourse existed between the conquerors and the conquered. He had\r\nacquired the _prestige_ which always attends extraordinary success or\r\ncapacity; and men preferred the chances of splendid results under such\r\na leader to the certainty of moderate gain under a general who did not\r\npossess his matchless genius. Thus it was that the lordly spirit and\r\ncommanding talents of Cortéz enabled him to convert the very elements\r\nof disaster into the means of present strength and future success!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1520.\r\n\r\n    CORTÉZ RETURNS TO THE CAPITAL--CAUSES OF THE REVOLT AGAINST THE\r\n    SPANIARDS.--CORTÉZ CONDEMNS ALVARADO--HIS CONDUCT TO\r\n    MONTEZUMA.--BATTLE IN THE CITY--MONTEZUMA MEDIATES.--FIGHT ON THE\r\n    GREAT TEMPLE OR TEOCALLI.--RETREAT OF THE SPANIARDS--NOCHE\r\n    TRISTE.--FLIGHT OF THE SPANIARDS TO TACUBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst Cortéz was beset with the difficulties recounted in our last\r\nchapter, and engaged in overcoming Narvaez on the coast, the news\r\nreached him of an insurrection in the capital, towards which he\r\nimmediately turned his steps. On approaching the city, intelligence\r\nwas brought that the active hostilities of the natives had been\r\nchanged, for the last fortnight, into a blockade, and that the\r\ngarrison had suffered dreadfully during his absence. Montezuma, too,\r\ndespatched an envoy who was instructed to impress the conqueror with\r\nthe Emperor's continued fidelity, and to exculpate him from all blame\r\nin the movement against Alvarado.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th June, 1520, Cortéz reached the capital. On all sides he\r\nsaw the melancholy evidences of war. There were neither greeting\r\ncrowds on the causeways, nor boats on the lake; bridges were broken\r\ndown; the brigantines or boats he had constructed to secure a retreat\r\nover the waters of these inland seas, were destroyed; the whole\r\npopulation seemed to have vanished, and silence brooded over the\r\nmelancholy scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe revolt against the lieutenant Alvarado was generally attributed to\r\nhis fiery impetuosity, and to the inhuman and motiveless slaughter\r\ncommitted by the Spanish troops, under his authority, during the\r\ncelebration of a solemn Aztec festival, called the \"incensing of\r\nHuitzilopotchtli.\" Six hundred victims, were, on that occasion, slain\r\nby the Spaniards, in cold blood, in the neighborhood of the Great\r\nTemple; nor was a single native, engaged in the mysterious rites,\r\nleft alive to tell the tale of the sudden and brutal assault.\r\n\r\nAlvarado, it is true, pretended that his spies had satisfactorily\r\nproved the existence of a well founded conspiracy, which was designed\r\nto explode upon this occasion; but the evidence is not sufficient to\r\njustify the disgraceful and horrid deed that must forever tarnish his\r\nfame. It is far more probable that rapacity was the true cause of the\r\nonslaught, and that the reckless companion of the conqueror, who had\r\nbeen entrusted with brief authority during his absence, miscalculated\r\nthe power of his Indian foe, and confounded the warlike Mexican of the\r\nvalley with the weaker soldiers, dwelling in more emasculating\r\nclimates, whom he had so rapidly confounded and overthrown in his\r\nmarch to the capital.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that this slaughter, combined with the other\r\ncauses of discontent already existing among the Aztecs, served to\r\nkindle the outraged national feeling with intense hatred of the\r\ninvaders. The city rose in arms, and the Spaniards were hemmed within\r\ntheir defences. Montezuma himself addressed the people from the\r\nbattlements, and stayed their active assault upon the works of\r\nAlvarado; but they strictly blockaded the enemy in his castle, cut off\r\nall supplies, and entrenched themselves in hastily constructed\r\nbarricades thrown up around the habitation of the Spaniards, resolved\r\nto rest behind these works until despair and famine would finally and\r\nsurely throw the helpless victims into their power. Here the invaders,\r\nwith scant provisions and brackish water, awaited the approach of\r\nCortéz, who received the explanations of Alvarado with manifest\r\ndisgust:--\"You have been false to your trust,\" said he, \"you have done\r\nbadly, indeed, and your conduct has been that of a madman!\"\r\n\r\nYet this was not a moment to break entirely with Alvarado, whose\r\nqualities, and perhaps, even, whose conduct, rendered him popular with\r\na large class of the Spanish adventurers. The newly recruited forces\r\nof Cortéz gave the conqueror additional strength, for he was now at\r\nthe head of no less than twelve hundred and fifty Spaniards, and eight\r\nthousand auxiliaries, chiefly Tlascalans. Yet, under the untoward\r\ncircumstances, the increase of his forces augmented the difficulties\r\nof their support. Montezuma hastened to greet him. But the Spaniard\r\nwas in no mood to trust the Emperor; and, as his Mexican subjects made\r\nno sign of reconciliation or submission, he refused the proferred\r\ninterview:--\"What have I,\" exclaimed he, haughtily, \"to do with this\r\ndog of a king who suffers us to starve before his eyes!\" He would\r\nreceive no apology from his countrymen who sought to exculpate the\r\nsovereign, or from the mediating nobles of the court:--\"Go tell your\r\nmaster,\" was his reply, \"to open the markets, or we will do it for\r\nhim, at his cost!\"\r\n\r\nBut the stern resistance of the natives was not intermitted. On the\r\ncontrary, active preparations were made to assault the irregular pile\r\nof stone buildings which formed the Palace of Axayacatl, in which the\r\nSpaniards were lodged. The furious populace rushed through every\r\navenue towards this edifice, and encountered with wonderful nerve and\r\nendurance, the ceaseless storm of iron hail which its stout defenders\r\nrained upon them from every quarter. Yet the onset of the Aztecs was\r\nalmost too fierce to be borne much longer by the besieged, when the\r\nSpaniards resorted to the lingering authority of Montezuma to save\r\nthem from annihilation. The pliant Emperor, still their prisoner,\r\nassumed his royal robes, and, with the symbol of sovereignty in his\r\nhand, ascended the central turret of the palace. Immediately, at this\r\nroyal apparition, the tumult of the fight was hushed whilst the king\r\naddressed his subjects in the language of conciliation and rebuke. Yet\r\nthe appeal was not satisfactory or effectual. \"Base Aztec,\"--shouted\r\nthe chiefs,--\"the white men have made you a woman, fit only to weave\r\nand spin!\"--whilst a cloud of stones, spears and arrows fell upon the\r\nmonarch, who sank wounded to the ground, though the bucklers of the\r\nSpaniards were promptly interposed to shield his person from violence.\r\nHe was borne to his apartments below; and, bowed to the earth by the\r\nhumiliation he had suffered alike from his subjects and his foes, he\r\nwould neither receive comfort nor permit his wounds to be treated by\r\nthose who were skilled in surgery. He reclined, in moody silence,\r\nbrooding over his ancient majesty and the deep disgrace which he felt\r\nhe had too long survived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war without continued to rage. The great Teocalli or\r\nMound-Temple, already described, was situated at a short distance\r\nopposite the Spanish defences; and, from this elevated position, which\r\ncommanded the invader's quarters, a body of five or six hundred\r\nMexicans, began to throw their missiles into the Spanish garrison,\r\nwhilst the natives, under the shelter of the sanctuaries, were\r\nscreened from the fire of the besieged. It was necessary to dislodge\r\nthis dangerous armament. An assault, under Escobar, was hastily\r\nprepared, but the hundred men who composed it, were thrice repulsed,\r\nand obliged finally to retreat with considerable loss. Cortéz had been\r\nwounded and disabled in his left hand, in the previous fight, but he\r\nbound his buckler to the crippled limb, and, at the head of three\r\nhundred chosen men, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, Ordaz and\r\nothers of his most gallant cavaliers, he sallied from the besieged\r\npalace. It was soon found that horses were useless in charging the\r\nIndians over the smooth and slippery pavements of the town and square,\r\nand accordingly Cortéz sent them back to his quarters; yet he managed\r\nto repulse the squadrons in the court-yard of the Teocalli, and to\r\nhold them in check by a file of arquebusiers. The singular\r\narchitecture of this Mound-Temple will be recollected by the reader,\r\nand the difficulty of its ascent, by means of five stairways and four\r\nterraces, was now increased by the crowds that thronged these narrow\r\navenues. From stair to stair, from gallery to gallery, the Spaniards\r\nfought onward and upward with resistless courage, incessantly flinging\r\ntheir Indian foes, by main strength, over the narrow ledges. At length\r\nthey reached the level platform of the top, which was capable of\r\ncontaining a thousand warriors. Here, at the shrine of the Aztec\r\nwar-god, was a site for the noblest contest in the empire. The area\r\nwas paved with broad and level stones. Free from all impediments, it\r\nwas unguarded at its edges by battlements, parapets, or, any defences\r\nwhich could protect the assailants from falling if they approached the\r\nsides too closely. Quarter was out of the question. The battle was\r\nhand to hand, and body to body. Combatants grappled and wrestled in\r\ndeadly efforts to cast each other from the steep and sheer ledges.\r\nIndian priests ran to and fro with streaming hair and sable garments,\r\nurging their superstitious children to the contest. Men tumbled\r\nheadlong over the sides of the area, and even Cortéz himself, by\r\nsuperior agility, alone, was saved from the grasp of two warriors who\r\ndragged him to the brink of the lofty pyramid and were about to dash\r\nhim to the earth.\r\n\r\nFor three hours the battle raged until every Indian combatant was\r\neither slain on the summit or hurled to the base. Forty-five of the\r\nSpaniards were killed, and nearly all wounded. A few Aztec priests,\r\nalone, of all the Indian band, survived to behold the destruction of\r\nthe sanctuaries, which had so often been desecrated by the hideous\r\nrites and offerings of their bloody religion.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the natives were panic-struck by this masterly and\r\nvictorious man[oe]uvre, whilst the Spaniards passed unmolested to\r\ntheir quarters, from which, at night, they again sallied to burn three\r\nhundred houses of the citizens.\r\n\r\nCortéz thought that these successes would naturally dismay the Mexicans,\r\nand proposed, through Mariana,--his faithful interpreter, who had\r\ncontinued throughout his adventures the chief reliance of the Spaniards\r\nfor intercourse with the Indians,--that this conflict should cease at\r\nonce, for the Aztecs must be convinced that a soldier who destroyed\r\ntheir gods, laid a part of their capital in ruins, and was able to\r\ninflict still more direful chastisement, was, indeed, invincible.\r\n\r\nBut the day of successful threats had passed. The force of the Aztecs\r\nwas still undiminished; the bridges were destroyed; the numbers of the\r\nSpaniards were lessened; hunger and thirst were beginning to do their\r\ndeadly work on the invaders; \"there will be only too few of you left,\"\r\nsaid they in reply,--\"to satisfy the revenge of our gods.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no longer time for diplomacy or delay, and, accordingly,\r\nCortéz resolved to quit the city as soon as practicable, and prepared\r\nthe means to accomplish this desirable retreat; but, on his first\r\nattempt he was unable to reach the open country through the easily\r\ndefended highway of the capital or the enfilading canals and lanes.\r\nFrom house tops and cross streets, innumerable Indians beset his path\r\nwherever he turned. Yet it was essential for the salvation of the\r\nSpaniards that they should evacuate the city. No other resource\r\nremained, and, desperate as it was, the conqueror persevered,\r\nunflinchingly, amid the more hazardous assaults of the Mexicans, and\r\nall the internal discords of his own band, whom a common danger did\r\nnot perfectly unite. He packed the treasure, gathered during the days\r\nof prosperous adventure, on his stoutest horses, and, with a portable\r\nbridge, to be thrown hastily over the canals, he departed from his\r\nstronghold on the dark and rainy evening which has become memorable in\r\nAmerican history, as the _noche triste_, or \"melancholy night.\" The\r\nMexicans were not usually alert during the darkness, and Cortéz hoped\r\nthat he might steal off unperceived in this unwatchful period. But he\r\nwas mistaken in his calculations. The Aztecs had become acquainted\r\nwith Spanish tactics and were eager for the arrival of the moment, by\r\nday or night, when the expected victims would fall into their hands.\r\nAs soon as the Spanish band had advanced a short distance along the\r\ncauseway of Tlacopan, the attack began by land and water; for the\r\nIndians assaulted them from their boats, with spears and arrows, or\r\nquitting their skiffs, grappled with the retreating soldiers in mortal\r\nagony, and rolled them from the causeway into the waters of the lake.\r\nThe bridge was wedged inextricably between the sides of a dyke, whilst\r\nammunition wagons, heavy guns, bales of rich cloths, chests of gold,\r\nartillery, and the bodies of men or horses, were piled in heaps on the\r\nhighway or rolled into the water. Forty-six of the cavalry were cut\r\noff and four hundred and fifty of the Christians killed, whilst four\r\nthousand of the Indian auxiliaries perished.[5] The General's baggage,\r\npapers, and minute diary of his adventures, were swallowed in the\r\nwaters. The ammunition, the artillery, and every musket were lost.\r\nMeanwhile Montezuma had perished from his wounds some days before the\r\nsortie was attempted, and his body had been delivered to his subjects\r\nwith suitable honors. Alvarado,--Tonatiuh, the \"child of the sun,\" as\r\nthe natives delighted to call him, escaped during the _noche triste_\r\nby a miraculous leap with the aid of his lance-staff over a canal, to\r\nwhose edge he had been pursued by the foe. And when Cortéz, at length,\r\nfound himself with his thin and battered band, on the heights of\r\nTacuba, west of the city, beyond the borders of the lake, it may be\r\nsaid, without exaggeration, that nothing was left to reassure him but\r\nhis indomitable heart and the faithful Indian girl whose lips, and\r\nperhaps whose counsel, had been so useful in his service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: These numbers are variously stated by different\r\nauthorities.--See Prescott, vol. 2d, p. 377.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1520.\r\n\r\n    RETREAT TO OTUMBA.--CORTÉZ IS ENCOUNTERED BY A NEW ARMY OF AZTECS\r\n    AND AUXILIARIES.--VICTORY OF THE SPANIARDS AT OTUMBA.--PROPOSED\r\n    RE-ALLIANCE OF AZTECS AND TLASCALANS.--FORAYS OF CORTÉZ--REDUCTION\r\n    OF THE EASTERN REGIONS.--CORTÉZ PROPOSES THE RECONQUEST--SENDS OFF\r\n    THE DISAFFECTED.--CORTÉZ SETTLES THE TLASCALAN SUCCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the disasters and fatigues of the _noche triste_, the melancholy\r\nand broken band of Cortéz rested for a day at Tacuba, whilst the\r\nMexicans returned to their capital, probably to bury the dead and\r\npurify their city. It is singular, yet it is certain, that they did\r\nnot follow up their successes by a death blow at the disarmed\r\nSpaniards. But this momentary paralysis of their efforts was not to be\r\ntrusted, and accordingly Cortéz began to retreat eastwardly, under the\r\nguidance of the Tlascalans, by a circuitous route around the northern\r\nlimits of lake Zumpango. The flying forces and their auxiliaries were\r\nsoon in a famishing condition, subsisting alone on corn or on wild\r\ncherries gathered in the forest, with occasional refreshment and\r\nsupport from the carcase of a horse that perished by the way. For six\r\ndays these wretched fragments of the Spanish army continued their\r\nweary pilgrimage, and, on the seventh, reached Otumba on the way from\r\nMexico to Tlascala. Along the whole of this march the fainting and\r\ndispirited band was, ever and anon, assailed by detached squadrons of\r\nthe enemy, who threw stones and rolled rocks on the men as they passed\r\nbeneath precipices, or assaulted them with arrows and spears. As\r\nCortéz advanced, the enemy gathered in his rear and bade him \"Go on\r\nwhither he should meet the vengeance due to his robbery and his\r\ncrimes,\" for the main body of the Aztecs had meanwhile passed by an\r\neastern route across the country, and placed itself in a position to\r\nintercept the Spaniards on the plains of Otumba. As the army of the\r\nconqueror crossed the last dividing ridge that overlooked the vale of\r\nOtompan, it beheld the levels below filled, as far as eye could\r\nreach, with the spears and standards of the Aztec victors, whose\r\nforces had been augmented by levies from the territory of the\r\nneighboring Tezcoco. Cortéz presented a sorry array to be launched\r\nfrom the cliffs upon this sea of lances. But he was not the man to\r\ntremble or hesitate. He spread out his main body as widely as\r\npossible, and guarded the flanks by the twenty horsemen who survived\r\nthe _noche triste_, and the disastrous march from Tacuba. He ordered\r\nhis cavalry not to cast away their lances, but to aim them constantly\r\nat the faces of the Indians, whilst the infantry were to thrust and\r\nnot to strike with their swords;--the leaders of the enemy were\r\nespecially to be selected as marks; and he, finally, bade his men\r\ntrust in God, who would not permit them to perish by the hands of\r\ninfidels. The signal was given for the charge. Spaniard and Tlascalan\r\nfought hand to hand with the foe. Long and doubtfully the battle raged\r\non both sides, until every Spaniard was wounded. Suddenly Cortéz\r\ndescried the ensignia of the enemy's commanding general, and knowing\r\nthat the fortunes of the day, in all probability, depended upon\r\nsecuring or slaying that personage, he commanded Sandoval, Olid,\r\nAlvarado, and Avila to follow and support him as he dashed towards the\r\nIndian chief. The Aztecs fell back as he rushed on, leaving a lane for\r\nthe group of galloping cavaliers. Cortéz and his companions soon\r\nreached the fatal spot, and the conqueror driving his lance through\r\nthe Aztec leader, left him to be dispatched by Juan de Salamanca. This\r\nwas the work of a moment. The death of the general struck a panic into\r\nthe combined forces of Tenochtitlan and Tezcoco, and a promiscuous\r\nflight began on all sides. At sunset, on the 8th of July, 1520, the\r\nSpaniards were victors on the field of Otumba, and gathering together\r\nin an Indian temple, which they found on an eminence overlooking the\r\nplain, they offered up a _Te Deum_ for their miraculous preservation\r\nas well as for the hope with which their success reinspired them.[6]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day the invaders quitted their encampment on the battle field\r\nand hastened towards the territory of their friends, the Tlascalans.\r\nThe Spaniards now presented themselves to the rulers of their allies\r\nin a different guise from that they wore when they first advanced\r\ntowards Mexico. Fully equipped, mounted, and furnished with\r\nammunition, they had then compelled the prompt submission of the\r\nTlascalans, and, assuring their alliance, had conquered the Cholulans,\r\nand obtained the control even of the capital and person of the Aztec\r\nEmperor himself. But now they returned defeated, plundered, unarmed,\r\npoor, scarcely clad, and with the loss of a large part of those Indian\r\nallies who had accompanied the expedition. There was reason for\r\ndisheartening fear in the breast of Cortéz, had it been susceptible of\r\nsuch an emotion. But the Lord of Tlascala reassured him, when he\r\ndeclared that their \"cause was common against Mexico, and, come weal,\r\ncome woe, they would prove loyal to the death!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were glad to find a friendly palace in Tlascala, in\r\nwhich to shelter themselves after the dreadful storms that had\r\nrecently broken on their head. Yet, in the quiet of their retreat, and\r\nin the excitement of their rallying blood, they began to reflect upon\r\nthe past and the disheartening aspect of the future. Murmurs, which\r\nwere at first confined to the barrack, at length assumed public\r\nsignificance, and a large body of the men, chiefly the soldiers of\r\nNarvaez, presented to Cortéz a petition which was headed by his own\r\nsecretary, demanding permission to retreat to La Villa Rica de la Vera\r\nCruz. Just at this moment, too, Cuitlahua, who mounted the throne of\r\nMexico on the death of Montezuma, despatched a mission to the\r\nTlascalans, proposing to bury the hatchet, and to unite in sweeping\r\nthe Spaniards from the realm. The hours which were consumed by the\r\nTlascalans in deliberating on this dread proposal were full of deep\r\nanxiety to Cortéz; for, in the present feeble condition of his Spanish\r\nforce, his whole reliance consisted in adroitly playing off one part\r\nof the Indian population against another. If he lost the aid,\r\nalliance, or neutrality of the Tlascalans, his cause was lost, and all\r\nhope of reconquest, or perhaps even of retreat, was gone forever.\r\n\r\nThe promised alliance of the Mexicans was warmly and sternly supported\r\nin the debates of the Tlascalan council by some of the nobles; yet,\r\nafter full and even passionate discussion, which ended in personal\r\nviolence between two of the chiefs, it was unanimously resolved to\r\nreject the proposal of their hereditary foes, who had never been able\r\nto subdue them as a nation in battle, but hoped to entrap them into\r\nalliance in the hour of common danger. These discussions, together\r\nwith the positive rejection by Cortéz of the Spanish petition, seem to\r\nhave allayed the anxiety of the invaders to return to Vera Cruz. With\r\nthe assured friendship of the Tlascalans they could rely upon some\r\ngood turn in fortune, and, at length, the vision of the conquest might\r\nbe realized under the commander who had led them through success and\r\ndefeat with equal skill.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Cortéz did not allow his men to remain long in idle\r\ngarrisons, brooding over the past, or becoming moody and querulous. If\r\nhe could not conquer a nation by a blow, he might perhaps subdue a\r\ntribe by a foray, while the military success, or golden plunder, would\r\nserve to keep alive the fire of enterprise in the breasts of his\r\ntroopers. His first attack, after he had recruited the strength of his\r\nmen, was on the Tepeacans, whom he speedily overthrew, and in whose\r\nchief town of Tepeaca, on the Mexican frontier, he established his\r\nhead quarters, in the midst of a flourishing and productive district,\r\nwhence his supplies were easily gathered. Here he received an\r\ninvitation from the cacique of Quauhquechollan,--a town of thirty\r\nthousand inhabitants, whose chief was impatient of the Mexican\r\nyoke,--to march to his relief. Olid was despatched on this expedition;\r\nbut getting entangled in disputes and frays with the Cholulans, whose\r\npeople he assaulted and took prisoners, Cortéz himself assumed command\r\nof the expedition. In fact, the conqueror was singularly unfortunate\r\nin the conduct of his subordinates, for all his disasters arose from\r\nconfidence in men whose judgment or temper was unequal to the task and\r\ndiscipline of control. In the assault and capture of this town, Cortéz\r\nand his men obtained a rich booty. They followed up the blow by taking\r\nthe strong city of Itzocan, which had also been held by a Mexican\r\ngarrison; and here, too, the captors seized upon rich spoils, while\r\nthe Indian auxiliaries were soon inflamed by the reports of booty, and\r\nhastened in numbers to the chief who led them to victory and plunder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortéz returned to Tepeaca from these expeditions, which were not\r\nalone predatory in their character, but were calculated to pave the\r\nway for his military approach once more to the city of Mexico, as soon\r\nas his schemes ripened for the conquest. The ruling idea of ultimate\r\nsuccess never for a moment left his mind. From Tepeaca he despatched\r\nhis officers on various expeditions, and marched Sandoval against a\r\nlarge body of the enemy lying between his camp and Vera Cruz. These\r\ndetachments defeated the Mexicans in two battles; reduced the whole\r\ncountry which is now known as lying between Orizaba and the western\r\nskirts of the plain of Puebla, and thus secured the communication with\r\nthe seacoast. Those who are familiar with the geography of Mexico,\r\nwill see at a glance, with what masterly generalship the dispositions\r\nof Cortéz were made to secure the success of his darling project. Nor\r\ncan we fail to recognize the power of a single indomitable will over\r\nmasses of Christians and Indians, in the wonderful as well as\r\nsuccessful control which the conqueror obtained in his dealings with\r\nhis countrymen as well as the natives at this period of extreme\r\ndanger. When Mexico was lost after the _noche triste_, the military\r\nresources of Cortéz were really nothing, for his slender band was\r\ndeprived of its most effective weapons, was broken in moral courage\r\nand placed on an equality, as to arms, with the Indians. The successes\r\nhe obtained at Otumba, Tlascala, Tepeaca, and elsewhere, not only\r\nre-established the _prestige_ of his genius among his countrymen, but\r\naffected even the Indians. The native cities and towns in the adjacent\r\ncountry appealed to him to decide in their difficulties, and his\r\ndiscretion and justice, as an arbitrator, assured him an ascendancy\r\nwhich it is surprising that a stranger who was ignorant of their\r\nlanguage could acquire among men who were in the semi-civilized and\r\nnaturally jealous state in which he found the Aztec and Tlascalan\r\ntribes. Thus it is that, under the influence of his will and genius,\r\n\"a new empire grew up, in the very heart of the land, forming a\r\ncounterpoise to the colossal power which had so long overshadowed it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of Cortéz, the moment had now arrived when he was\r\nstrong enough, and when it was proper, that he should attempt the\r\nreconquest of the capital. His alliance with the Tlascalans reposed\r\nupon a firm basis, and consequently he could rely upon adequate\r\nsupport from the Indians who would form the majority of his army. Nor\r\nwere his losses of military equipments and stores unrepaired. Fortune\r\nfavored him by the arrival of several vessels at Vera Cruz, from which\r\nhe obtained munitions of war and additional troops. One hundred and\r\nfifty well provided men and twenty horses were joined to his forces by\r\nthese arrivals.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure, however, he despatched the few discontented men\r\nfrom his camp and gave them a vessel with which they might regain\r\ntheir homes. He wrote an account of his adventures, moreover, to his\r\ngovernment in Spain, and besought his sovereign to confirm his\r\nauthority in the lands and over the people he might add to the Spanish\r\ncrown. He addressed, also, the Royal Audiencia at St. Domingo to\r\ninterest its members in his cause, and when he despatched four vessels\r\nfrom Vera Cruz for additional military supplies, he freighted them\r\nwith specimens of gold and Indian fabrics to inflame the cupidity of\r\nnew adventurers.\r\n\r\nIn Tlascala, he settled the question of succession in the government;\r\nconstructed new arms and caused old ones to be repaired; made powder\r\nwith sulphur obtained from the volcano of Popocatopetl; and, under the\r\ndirection of his builder, Lopez, prepared the timber for brigantines,\r\nwhich he designed to carry, in pieces, and launch on the lake at the\r\ntown of Tezcoco. At that port, he resolved to prepare himself fully\r\nfor the final attack, and, this time, he determined to assault the\r\nenemy's capital by water, as well as by land.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: We have no accurate estimate of the numbers engaged in\r\nthis battle, or of the slain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1520-1521.\r\n\r\n    DEATH OF CUITLAHUA--HE IS SUCCEEDED BY GUATEMOZIN.--AZTECS LEARN\r\n    THE PROPOSED RECONQUEST--CORTÉZ's FORCES FOR THIS\r\n    ENTERPRISE.--CORTÉZ AT TEZCOCO--HIS PLANS AND ACTS.--MILITARY\r\n    EXPEDITIONS OF CORTÉZ IN THE VALLEY.--OPERATIONS AT CHALCO AND\r\n    CUERNAVACA.--XOCHIMILCO--RETURN TO TACUBA.--CORTÉZ RETURNS TO\r\n    TEZCOCO AND IS REINFORCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a short and brilliant reign of four months, Cuitlahua, the\r\nsuccessor of Montezuma, died of small pox, which, at that period,\r\nraged throughout Mexico, and he was succeeded by Guauhtemotzin, or,\r\nGuatemozin, the nephew of the two last Emperors. This sovereign\r\nascended the Aztec throne in his twenty-fifth year, yet he seems to\r\nhave been experienced as a soldier and firm as a patriot.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be imagined that the Aztec court was long ignorant of the\r\ndoings of Cortéz. It was evident that the bold and daring Spaniard had\r\nnot only been unconquered in heart and resolution, but that he even\r\nmeditated a speedy return to the scene of his former successful\r\nexploits. The Mexicans felt sure that, upon this occasion, his advent\r\nand purposes would be altogether undisguised, and that when he again\r\ndescended to the valley in which their capital nestled, he would, in all\r\nprobability, be prepared to sustain himself and his followers in any\r\nposition his good fortune and strong arm might secure to him. The news,\r\nmoreover, of his firm alliance with the Tlascalans and all the\r\ndiscontented tributaries of the Aztec throne, as well as of the\r\nreinforcements and munitions he received from Vera Cruz, was quickly\r\nbrought to the city of Mexico; and every suitable preparation was made,\r\nby strengthening the defences, encouraging the vassals, and disciplining\r\nthe troops, to protect the menaced empire from impending ruin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNor was Cortéz, in his turn, idle in exciting the combined forces of\r\nthe Spaniards and Indians for the last effort which it was probable he\r\ncould make for the success of his great enterprise. His Spanish force\r\nconsisted of nigh six hundred men, forty of whom were cavalry,\r\ntogether with eighty arquebusiers and crossbowmen. Nine cannon of\r\nsmall calibre, supplied with indifferent powder, constituted his train\r\nof artillery. His army of Indian allies is estimated at the doubtless\r\nexaggerated number of over one hundred thousand, armed with the\r\n_maquahuatil_, pikes, bows, arrows, and divided into battalions, each\r\nwith its own banners, insignia and commanders. His appeal to all the\r\nmembers of this motley array was couched in language likely to touch\r\nthe passions, the bigotry, the enthusiasm and avarice of various\r\nclasses; and, after once more crossing the mountains, and reaching the\r\nmargin of the lakes, he encamped on the 31st of December, 1520, within\r\nthe venerable precincts of Tezcoco, \"the place of rest.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Tezcoco, Cortéz was firmly planted on the eastern edge of the\r\nvalley of Mexico, in full sight of the capital which lay across the\r\nlake, near its western shore, at the distance of about twelve miles.\r\nBehind him, towards the seacoast, he commanded the country, as we have\r\nalready related, while, by passes through lower spurs of the\r\nmountains, he might easily communicate with the valleys of which the\r\nTlascalans and Cholulans were masters.\r\n\r\nFortifying himself strongly in his dwelling and in the quarters of his\r\nmen, in Tezcoco, he at once applied himself to the task of securing\r\nsuch military positions in the valley and in the neighborhood of the\r\ngreat causeway between the lakes as would command an outlet from the\r\ncapital by land, and enable him to advance across the waters of\r\nTezcoco without the annoyance of enemies who might sally forth from\r\nstrongholds on his left flank. On his right, the chain of lakes,\r\nextending farther than the eye can reach, furnished the best\r\nprotection he could desire. Accordingly, he first of all reduced and\r\ndestroyed the ancient city of Iztapalapan,--a place of fifty thousand\r\ninhabitants, distant about six leagues from the town of\r\nTezcoco,--which was built on the narrow isthmus dividing the lake of\r\nthat name from the waters of Chalco. He next directed his forces\r\nagainst the city of Chalco, lying on the eastern extremity of the lake\r\nthat bore its name, where his army was received in triumph by the\r\npeaceful citizens after the evacuation of the Mexican garrison. Such\r\nwere the chief of his military and precautionary expeditions, until\r\nthe arrival of the materials for the boats or brigantines which Martin\r\nLopez, and his four Spanish assistant carpenters, had already put\r\ntogether and tried on the waters of Zahuapan; and which, after a\r\nsuccessful experiment, they had taken to pieces again and borne in\r\nfragments to Tezcoco.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1521, Cortéz entrusted his garrison at Tezcoco\r\nto Sandoval, and, with three hundred and fifty Spaniards, and nearly\r\nall his Indian allies, departed on an expedition designed to\r\nreconnoitre the capital. He passed from his stronghold northwardly\r\naround the head of the lakes north of Tezcoco,--one of which is now\r\ncalled San Cristoval,--and took possession of the insular town of\r\nXaltocan. Passing thence along the western edge of the vale of Anahuac\r\nor Mexico, he reached the city of Tacuba, west of the capital, with\r\nwhich so many disastrous recollections were connected on his first sad\r\nexit from the imperial city. During this expedition the troops of the\r\nconqueror were almost daily engaged in skirmishes with the guerilla\r\nforces of the Aztecs; yet, notwithstanding their constant annoyance\r\nand stout resistance, the Spaniards were invariably successful and\r\neven managed to secure some booty of trifling value. After a fortnight\r\nof rapid marching, fighting and reconnoitering, Cortéz and his men\r\nreturned to Tezcoco. Here he was met by an embassy from the friendly\r\nChalcans and pressed for a sufficient force to sustain them against\r\nthe Mexicans, who despatched the warriors of certain neighboring and\r\nloyal strongholds to annoy the inhabitants of a town which had\r\nexhibited a desire to fraternize with the invading Spaniards. Indeed,\r\nthe Aztecs saw the importance of maintaining the control of a point\r\nwhich commanded the most important avenue to their capital from the\r\nAtlantic coast. The wearied troops of Cortéz were in no plight to\r\nrespond to the summons of the Chalcans at that moment, for their\r\nhurried foray and incessant conflicts with the enemy had made them\r\nanxious for the repose they might justly expect in Tezcoco.\r\nNevertheless, Cortéz did not choose to rely upon his naval enterprise\r\nalone; but, conscious as he was of holding the main key of the land as\r\nwell as water, he despatched, without delay, his trusty Sandoval with\r\nthree hundred Spanish infantry and twenty horse to protect the town of\r\nChalco and reduce the hostile fortifications in its vicinity. This\r\nduty he soon successfully performed. But the Aztecs renewed the\r\nassault on Chalco with a fleet of boats, and were again beaten off\r\nwith the loss of a number of their nobles, who were delivered by the\r\nvictors to Sandoval whom Cortéz had sent back to support the contested\r\ntown as soon as the news of the fresh attack reached him.\r\n\r\nBy this time the brigantines were nearly completed, and the canal dug\r\nby which they were to be carried to the waters of the lake, for, at\r\nthat time, the town of Tezcoco was distant from its margin. He dared\r\nnot trust these precious materials for his future success beyond the\r\nshelter of his citadel in Tezcoco, since every effort had been already\r\nmade by hostile and marauding parties to destroy them; and he was\r\ntherefore obliged to undergo the trouble of digging this canal, about\r\nhalf a league in length, in order to launch his vessels when the\r\nmoment for final action arrived.\r\n\r\nNor was his heart uncheered by fresh arrivals from the old world. Two\r\nhundred men, well provided with arms and ammunition, and with upwards\r\nof seventy horses,--coming most probably from Hispaniola,--found their\r\nway from Vera Cruz to Tezcoco, and united themselves with the corps of\r\nCortéz.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Emperor again directed his arms against his recreant\r\nsubjects of Chalco, which he seemed resolved to subdue and hold at all\r\nhazards, so as effectually to cut off the most important land approach\r\nto his capital. Envoys arrived in the Spanish camp with reports of the\r\ndanger that menaced them, and earnest appeals for efficient support.\r\nThis time, Cortéz resolved to lead the party destined for this service,\r\nand, on the 5th of April, set out with thirty horsemen, three hundred\r\ninfantry and a large body of Tlascalans and Tezcocans, to succor a city\r\nwhose neutrality, at least, it was important, as we have already shown,\r\nshould eventually be secured. He seems to have effected, by his personal\r\ninfluence in Chalco and its neighborhood, what his lieutenant Sandoval\r\nhad been unable to do by arms, so that, he not only rendered a large\r\nnumber of loyal Aztecs passive, but even secured the co-operation of\r\nadditional auxiliaries from among the Chalcans and the tribes that dwelt\r\non the borders of their lake.\r\n\r\nCortéz was not, however, content with this demonstration against his\r\nnear neighbors, but, resolved, now that he was once more in the\r\nsaddle, to cross the _sierra_ that hemmed in the vale of Anahuac, on\r\nthe south, and to descend its southern slopes on a visit to the warmer\r\nregions that basked at their feet. Accordingly he prosecuted his\r\nsouthern march through large bodies of harrassing skirmishers, who\r\nhung upon the rear and flanks of his troop, and annoyed it with arrows\r\nand missiles, which they hurled from the crags as his men threaded the\r\nnarrow defiles of the mountains. Passing through Huaxtepec and\r\nJauhtepec, he arrived on the ninth day of his march, before the strong\r\ntown of Guauhnahuac, or Cuernavaca, as it is now known in the\r\ngeography of Mexico. It was the capital of the Tlahuicas, and an\r\nimportant and wealthy tributary of the Aztecs. Here too he encountered\r\nhostile resistance which he quickly overcame. His name as a successful\r\nwarrior had preceded him among these more effeminate races, and the\r\ntrembling lords of the territory soon submitted to his mercy.\r\nDeparting from Cuernavaca, Cortéz turned again northwards, and\r\nascending the _sierra_ in a new direction re-entered the valley of\r\nAnahuac or Mexico, by the main route which now penetrates the southern\r\nportion of its rim. From the summits of these mountains, where the\r\ncool air of the temperate clime sings through the limbs and tassels of\r\nhardy pines, Cortéz swooped down upon Xochimilco, or the \"field of\r\nflowers,\" where he was again encountered by guerillas and more\r\nformidable squadrons from the Aztec capital which was but twelve miles\r\ndistant. Here, again, after several turns in the tide of fortune, the\r\nSpaniards were triumphant and obtained a rich booty. From Xochimilco\r\nthe little band and the auxiliaries advanced, among continual dangers,\r\naround the western margin of the lakes, and, skirting the feet of the\r\nmountains, attained, once more, the town of Tacuba.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conqueror had thus circled the valley, and penetrated the adjacent\r\nsouthern vale, in his two expeditions. Wherever he went, the strange\r\nweapons of his Spaniards, the singular appearance of his mounted men,\r\nand his uniform success, served to inspire the natives with a salutary\r\ndread of his mysterious power. He now knew perfectly the topography of\r\nthe country,--for he was forced to be his own engineer as well as\r\ngeneral. He had become acquainted with the state of the Aztec defences,\r\nas well as with the slender hold the central power of the empire\r\nretained over the tributary tribes, towns, and districts which had been\r\nso often vexed by taxation to support a voluptuous sovereign and\r\navaricious aristocracy. He found the sentiment of patriotic union and\r\nloyalty but feeble among the various populations he visited. The ties of\r\ninternational league had every where been adroitly loosened by the\r\nconqueror, either through his eloquence or his weapons; and, from all\r\nhis careful investigations, both of character and country, he had reason\r\nto believe that the realm of Mexico was at length almost within his\r\ngrasp. The capital was now encircled with a cordon of disloyal cities.\r\nEvery place of importance had been visited, conquered, subdued, or\r\ndestroyed in its moral courage or natural allegiance. But Tacuba was too\r\nnear the capital to justify him in trusting his jaded band within so\r\ndangerous a neighborhood. Accordingly, he did not delay a day in that\r\ncity, but, gathering his soldiers as soon as they were refreshed, he\r\ndeparted for Tezcoco by the northern journey around the lakes. His way\r\nwas again beset with difficulties. The season of rain and storm in those\r\nlofty regions had just set in. The road was flooded, and the soldiers\r\nwere forced to plough through mud in drenched garments. But as they\r\napproached their destination, Sandoval came forth to meet them, with\r\ncompanions who had freshly arrived from the West Indies; and, besides,\r\nhe bore the cheering news that the brigantines were ready to be launched\r\nfor the last blow at the heart of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1521.\r\n\r\n    CORTÉZ RETURNS--CONSPIRACY AMONG HIS MEN DETECTED.--EXECUTION OF\r\n    VILLAFAÑA--BRIGANTINES LAUNCHED.--XICO TENCATL'S TREASON AND\r\n    EXECUTION.--DISPOSITION OF FORCES TO ATTACK THE CITY.--SIEGE AND\r\n    ASSAULTS ON THE CITY.--FIGHT AND REVERSES OF THE\r\n    SPANIARDS.--SACRIFICE OF CAPTIVES--FLIGHT OF ALLIES.--CONTEST\r\n    RENEWED--STARVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of Cortéz to his camp, after all the toils of his arduous\r\nexpedition, was not hailed with unanimous delight by those who had\r\nhitherto shared his dangers and successes, since the loss of the\r\ncapital. There were persons in the small band of Spaniards,--especially\r\namong those who had been added from the troops of Narvaez,--who still\r\nbrooded over the disaffection and mutinous feelings which had been\r\nmanifested at Tlascala before the march to Tezcoco. They were men who\r\neagerly flocked to the standard of the conqueror for plunder; whose\r\nhearts were incapable of appreciating the true spirit of glorious\r\nadventure in the subjugation of an empire, and who despised victories\r\nthat were productive of nothing but fame.\r\n\r\nThese discontented men conspired, about this period, under the lead of\r\nAntonio Villafaña, a common soldier; and it was the design of the\r\nrecreant band to assassinate Sandoval, Olid and Alvarado, together\r\nwith Cortéz, and other important men who were known to be deepest in\r\nthe General's councils or interests. After the death of these\r\nleaders,--with whose fall the enterprise would doubtless have\r\nperished,--a brother-in-law of Velasquez, by name Francisco Verdugo,\r\nwho was altogether ignorant of the designs of the conspirators, was to\r\nbe placed in command of the panic-stricken troop, which, it was\r\nsupposed, would instantly unite under the new general.\r\n\r\nIt was the project of these wretched dastards to assault and despatch\r\nthe conqueror and his officers whilst engaged in opening despatches,\r\nwhich were to be suddenly presented, as if just arrived from Castile.\r\nBut, a day before the consummation of the treachery, one of the party\r\nthrew himself at the feet of Cortéz and betrayed the project, together\r\nwith the fact, that, in the possession of Villafaña, would be found a\r\npaper containing the names of his associates in infamy.\r\n\r\nCortéz immediately summoned the leaders whose lives were threatened,\r\nand, after a brief consultation, the party hastened to the quarters of\r\nVillafaña accompanied by four officers. The arch conspirator was\r\narrested, and the paper wrested from him as he attempted to swallow\r\nit. He was instantaneously tried by a military court,--and, after\r\nbrief time for confession and shrift, was swung by the neck from the\r\ncasement of his quarters. The prompt and striking sentence was\r\nexecuted before the army knew of the crime; and the scroll of names\r\nbeing destroyed by Cortéz, the memory of the meditated treachery was\r\nforever buried in oblivion. The commander, however, knew and marked\r\nthe men whose participation had been so unexpectedly revealed to him;\r\nbut he stifled all discontent by letting it be understood that the\r\nonly persons who suffered for the shameful crime had made no\r\nconfession! He could not spare men from his thin ranks even at the\r\ndemand of justice; for even the felons who sought his life were wanted\r\nin the toils and battles of his great and final enterprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on the 28th of April, 1521, amid the solemn services of\r\nreligion, and in the presence of the combined army of Spaniards and\r\nIndians, that the long cherished project of launching the brigantines\r\nwas finally accomplished. They reached the lake safely through the\r\ncanal which had been dug for them from the town of Texcoco.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish forces, designed to operate in this last attack, consisted\r\nof eighty-seven horse and eight hundred and eighteen infantry, of\r\nwhich one hundred and eighteen were arquebusiers and crossbowmen.\r\nThree large iron field pieces and fifteen brazen falconets formed the\r\nordnance. A plentiful supply of shot and balls, together with fifty\r\nthousand copper-headed arrows, composed the ammunition. Three hundred\r\nmen were sent on board the twelve vessels which were used in the\r\nenterprise, for unfortunately, one of the thirteen that were\r\noriginally ordered to be built, proved useless upon trial. The\r\nnavigation of these brigantines, each one of which carried a piece of\r\nheavy cannon, was, of course, not difficult, for although the waters\r\nof the lake have evidently shrunken since the days of the conquest, it\r\nis not probable that it was more than three or four feet deeper than\r\nat present.[7] The distance to be traversed from Tezcoco to the\r\ncapital was about twelve miles, and the subsequent service was to be\r\nrendered in the neighborhood of the causeways, and under the\r\nprotection of the walls of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Indian allies from Tlascala came up in force at the appointed\r\ntime. These fifty thousand well equipped men were led by Xicotencatl,\r\nwho, as the expedition was about to set forth by land and water for\r\nthe final attack, seems to have been seized with a sudden panic, and\r\ndeserted his standard with a number of followers. There was no hope\r\nfor conquest without the alliance and loyal support of the Tlascalans.\r\nThe decision of Cortéz upon the occurrence of this dastardly act of a\r\nman in whose faith he had religiously confided, although he knew he\r\nwas not very friendly to the Spaniards, was prompt and terribly\r\nsevere. A chosen band was directed to follow the fugitive even to the\r\nwalls of Tlascala. There, the deserter was arrested, brought back to\r\nTezcoco, and hanged on a lofty gallows in the great square of that\r\ncity. This man, says Prescott, \"was the only Tlascalan who swerved\r\nfrom his loyalty to the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll being now prepared, Cortéz planned his attack. It will be\r\nrecollected that the city of Mexico rose, like Venice, from the bosom of\r\nthe placid waters, and that its communication with the main land was\r\nkept up by the great causeways which were described in the earlier\r\nportion of this narrative. The object of the conqueror, therefore, was\r\nto shut up the capital, and cut off all access to the country by an\r\nefficient blockade of the lake, with his brigantines, and of the land\r\nwith his infantry and cavalry. Accordingly he distributed his forces\r\ninto three bodies or separate camps. The first of these, under Pedro de\r\nAlvarado, consisting of thirty horse, one hundred and sixty-eight\r\nSpanish infantry, and twenty-five thousand Tlascalans, was to command\r\nthe causeway of Tacuba. The second division, of equal magnitude, under\r\nOlid, was to be posted at Cojohuacan, so as to command the causeways\r\nthat led eastwardly into the city. The third equal corps of the Spanish\r\narmy was entrusted to Sandoval, but its Indian force was to be drawn\r\nfrom native allies at Chalco. Alvarado and Olid were to proceed around\r\nthe northern head of the lake of Tezcoco, whilst Sandoval, supported by\r\nCortéz with the brigantines, passed around the southern portion of it,\r\nto complete the destruction of the town of Iztapalapan, which was deemed\r\nby the conqueror altogether too important a point to be left in the\r\nrear. In the latter part of May, 1521, all these cavaliers got into\r\ntheir assigned military positions, and it is from this period that the\r\ncommencement of the siege of Mexico is dated, although Alvarado had\r\npreviously had some conflicts with the people on the causeway that led\r\nto his head quarters in Tacuba, and had already destroyed the pipes that\r\nfed the water-tanks and fountains of the capital.\r\n\r\nAt length Cortéz set sail with his flotilla in order to sustain\r\nSandoval's march to Iztapalapan. As he passed across the lake and\r\nunder the shadow of the \"rock of the Marquis,\" he descried from his\r\nbrigantines several hundred canoes of the Mexicans filled with\r\nsoldiers and advancing rapidly over the calm lake. There was no wind\r\nto swell his sails or give him command of his vessels' motion, and the\r\nconqueror was obliged to await the arrival of the canoes without\r\nmaking such disposition for action as was needful in the emergency.\r\nBut as the Indian squadron approached, a breeze suddenly sprang up,\r\nand Cortéz, widening his line of battle, bore down upon the frail\r\nskiffs, overturning, crushing and sinking them by the first blow of\r\nhis formidable prows, whilst he fired to the right and left amid the\r\ndiscomfitted flotilla. But few of these Indian boats returned to the\r\ncanals of the city, and this signal victory made Cortéz, forever\r\nafter, the undisputed master of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror took up his head quarters at Xoloc, where the causeway\r\nof Cojohuacan met the great causeway of the south. The chief avenues\r\nto Mexico had been occupied for some time, as has been already\r\nrelated, but either through ignorance or singular neglect, there was\r\nthe third great causeway, of Tepejacac, on the north, which still\r\nafforded the means of communication with the people of the surrounding\r\ncountry. This had been altogether neglected. Alvarado was immediately\r\nordered to close this outlet, and Sandoval took up his position on the\r\ndyke. Thus far the efforts of the Spaniards and auxiliaries had been\r\nconfined to precautionary movements rather than to decisive assaults\r\nupon the capital. But it soon became evident that a city like Mexico\r\nmight hold out long against a blockade alone. Accordingly an attack\r\nwas ordered by Cortéz to be made by the two commanders at the other\r\nmilitary points nearest their quarters. The brigantines sailed along\r\nthe sides of the causeways, and aided by their enfilading fires, the\r\nadvance of the squadrons on land. The infantry and cavalry advanced\r\nupon the great avenue that divided the town from north to south. Their\r\nheavy guns were brought up and soon mowed a path for the musketeers\r\nand crossbowmen. The flying enemy retreated towards the great square\r\nin the centre of the city, and were followed by the impetuous\r\nSpaniards and their Indian allies. The outer wall of the Great Temple,\r\nitself, was soon passed by the hot-blooded cavaliers, some of whom\r\nrushed up the stairs and circling corridors of the Teocalli, whence\r\nthey pushed the priests over the sides of the pyramid and tore off the\r\ngolden mask and jewels of the Aztec war-god. But the small band of\r\ninvaders had, for a moment only, appalled the Mexicans, who rallied in\r\nnumbers at this daring outrage, and sprang vindictively upon the\r\nsacrilegious assailants. The Spaniards and their allies fled; but the\r\npanic with which they were seized deprived their retreat of all order\r\nor security. Cortéz, himself, was unable to restore discipline, when\r\nsuddenly, a troop of Spanish horsemen dashed into the thick of the\r\nfight, and intimidating the Indians, by their superstitious fears of\r\ncavalry, they soon managed to gather and form the broken files of\r\ntheir Spanish and Indian army, so that, soon after the hour of\r\nvespers, the combined forces drew off with their artillery and\r\nammunition to the barrack at Xoloc.\r\n\r\nAbout this period, the inhabitants of Xochimilco and some tribes of\r\nrude but valiant Otomies gave in their adhesion to the Spaniards. The\r\nPrince of Tezcoco, too, despatched fifty thousand levies to the aid of\r\nCortéz. Thus strengthened, another attack was made upon the city. Most\r\nof the injuries which had been done to the causeways in the first\r\nonslaught had been repaired, so that the gates of the capital, and\r\nfinally the great square, were reached by the Spaniards with nearly as\r\ngreat difficulty as upon their former attempt. But this time the\r\ninvaders advanced more cautiously into the heart of the city, where\r\nthey fired and destroyed their ancient quarters in the old palace of\r\nAxayacatl and the edifices adjoining the royal palace on the other\r\nside of the square. These incursions into the capital were frequently\r\nrepeated by Cortéz, nor were the Mexicans idle in their systematic\r\nplans to defeat the Spaniards. All communication with the country, by\r\nthe causeways was permanently interrupted; yet the foe stealthily, and\r\nin the night, managed to evade the vigilance of the twelve cruisers\r\nwhose numbers were indeed insufficient to maintain a stringent naval\r\nblockade of so large a city as Mexico. But the success of Cortéz, in\r\nall his engagements by land and water, his victorious incursions into\r\nthe very heart of the city, and the general odium which was cherished\r\nagainst the central power of the empire by all the tributary tribes\r\nand dependant provinces, combined, at this moment, to aid the efforts\r\nof the conqueror in cutting off supplies from the famishing capital.\r\nThe great towns and small villages in the neighborhood threw off their\r\nallegiance, and the camps of the Spanish leaders thronged with one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand auxiliaries selected from among the\r\nrecreants. The Spaniards were amply supplied with food from these\r\nfriendly towns, and never experienced the sufferings from famine that\r\nwere soon to overtake the beleaguered capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt length the day was fixed for a general assault upon the city by the\r\ntwo divisions under Alvarado and Cortéz. As usual, the battle was\r\npreceded by the celebration of mass, and the army then advanced in\r\nthree divisions up the most important streets. They entered the town,\r\ncast down the barricades which had been erected to impede their\r\nprogress, and, with remarkable ease, penetrated even to the\r\nneighborhood of the market-place. But the very facility of their\r\nadvance alarmed the cautious mind of Cortéz, and induced him to\r\nbelieve that this slack resistance was but designed to seduce him\r\nfarther and farther within the city walls until he found himself\r\nbeyond the reach of succor or retreat. This made him pause. His men,\r\nmore eager for victory and plunder than anxious to secure themselves\r\nby filling up the canals and clearing the streets of their\r\nimpediments, had rushed madly on without taking proper precaution to\r\nprotect their rear, if the enemy became too hot in front. Suddenly the\r\nhorn of Guatemozin was heard from a neighboring Teocalli, and the\r\nflying Indians, at the sacred and warning sound, turned upon the\r\nSpaniards with all the mingled feeling of reinspired revenge and\r\nreligion. For a while the utmost disorder prevailed in the ranks of\r\nthe invaders, Spaniards, Tlascalans, Tezcocans and Otomies, were mixed\r\nin a common crowd of combatants. From the tops of houses; from\r\nconverging streets; from the edges of canals,--crowds of Aztecs\r\nswarmed and poured their vollies of javelins, arrows and stones. Many\r\nwere driven into the lake. Cortéz himself had nigh fallen a victim in\r\nthe dreadful _melee_, and was rescued with difficulty. Meanwhile,\r\nAlvarado and Sandoval had penetrated the city from the western\r\ncauseway, and aided in stemming the onslaught of the Aztecs. For a\r\nwhile the combined forces served to check the boiling tide of battle\r\nsufficiently to enable those who were most sorely pressed to be\r\ngradually withdrawn, yet not until sixty-two Spaniards and a multitude\r\nof allies, besides many killed and wounded, had fallen captives and\r\nvictims in the hands of their implacable enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was yet day when the broken band withdrew from the city, and\r\nreturned to the camps either on the first slopes of the hills, or at\r\nthe terminations of the causeways. But sad, indeed, was the spectacle\r\nthat presented itself to their eyes, as they gazed towards the city,\r\nthrough the clear atmosphere of those elevated regions, when they\r\nheard the drum sound from the top of the Great Teocalli. It was the\r\ndread signal of sacrifice. The wretched Spaniards, who had been\r\ncaptured in the fight, were, one after another, stretched on the stone\r\nin front of the hideous idols, and their reeking hearts, torn from\r\ntheir bosoms, thrown as propitiating morsels into the flames before\r\nthe deities. The mutilated remains of the captives were then flung\r\ndown the steep sides of the pyramid, to glut the crowds at its base\r\nwith a \"cannibal repast.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhilst these repulses and dreadful misfortunes served to dispirit the\r\nSpaniards and elate the Aztecs, they were not without their signally\r\nbad effects upon the auxiliaries. Messages were sent to these\r\ninsurgent bodies by the Emperor. He conjured them to return to their\r\nallegiance. He showed them how bravely their outraged gods had been\r\nrevenged. He spoke of the reverses that had befallen the white men in\r\nboth their invasions, and warned them that a parricidal war like this\r\ncould \"come to no good for the people of Anahuac.\" Otomies, Cholulans,\r\nTepeacans, Tezcocans, and even the loyal Tlascalans, the hereditary\r\nenemies of the Montezumas and Guatemozins, stole off secretly under\r\nthe cover of night. There were of course exceptions in this inglorious\r\ndesertion; but it seems that perhaps the majority of the tribes\r\ndeparted for their homes with the belief that the tide had turned\r\nagainst the Spanish conqueror and that it was best to escape before it\r\nwas too late, the scandal or danger of open treason against their\r\nlawful Emperor. But, amid all these disasters, the noble heart of\r\nCortéz remained firm and true to his purpose. He placed his artillery\r\nagain in position upon the causeways, and, never wasting his\r\nammunition, contrived to husband it carefully until the assaulting\r\nAztecs swarmed in such numbers on the dykes that his discharges mowed\r\nthem down like grass as they advanced to attack him. It was a gloomy\r\ntime, requiring vigilance by day and by night--by land and by water.\r\nThe brigantines were still secure. They swept the lake continually and\r\ncut off supplies designed for the capital. The Spaniards hermetically\r\nsealed the causeways with their cannon, and thus, at length, was the\r\ncity that would not yield to storm given over to starvation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The writer sounded the lake in the channel from Mexico to\r\nTezcoco in 1842, and did not find more than 2-1/2 feet in the deepest\r\npath. The Indians, at present, wade over all parts of the lake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1521.\r\n\r\n    AZTEC PREDICTION--IT IS NOT VERIFIED.--CORTÉZ REINFORCED BY FRESH\r\n    ARRIVALS.--FAMINE IN THE CITY.--CORTÉZ LEVELS THE CITY TO ITS\r\n    FOUNDATION.--CONDITION OF THE CAPITAL--ATTACK RENEWED.--CAPTURE OF\r\n    GUATEMOZIN--SURRENDER OF THE CITY.--FRIGHTFUL CONDITION OF THE\r\n    CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desertion of numerous allies, which we have noticed in the last\r\nchapter, was not alone prompted by the judgment of the flying Indians,\r\nbut was stimulated in a great degree by the prophecy of the Aztec\r\npriests, that, within eight days from the period of prediction, the\r\nbeleaguered city would be delivered from the Spaniards. But the sun\r\nrose on the ninth over the inexorable foes still in position on the\r\ncauseways and on the lake. The news was soon sent by the allies who\r\nhad remained faithful, to those who had fled, and the deficient ranks\r\nwere quickly restored by the numbers who flocked back to the Spanish\r\nstandard as soon as they were relieved from superstitious fear.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, moreover, a vessel that had been destined for Ponce de\r\nLeon, in his romantic quest of Florida, put into Vera Cruz with\r\nammunition and military stores, which were soon forwarded to the valley.\r\nThus strengthened by his renerved Indian auxiliaries, and reinforced\r\nwith Spanish powder and guns, Cortéz was speedily again in train to\r\nassail the capital; for he was not content to be idle except when the\r\nmost serious disasters forced him to endure the slow and murderous\r\nprocess of subduing the city by famine. There may, perhaps, be something\r\nnoble and chivalrous in this feeling of the Castilian hero. His heart\r\nrevolted at the sight of misery inflicted without a chance of escape,\r\nand it delighted in those conflicts which matched man with man, and gave\r\nthe ultimate victory to valor and not to stratagem.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the conqueror resolved again to commence active\r\nhostilities. But, this time, he designed to permit no hazards of the\r\nmoment, and no personal carelessness of his officers to obstruct his\r\nentry or egress from the city. As he advanced the town was to be\r\ndemolished; the canals filled up; the breaches in the dykes perfectly\r\nrepaired; and, as he moved onwards to the north and west, he\r\ndetermined that his path should be over a level and solid surface on\r\nwhich he might encounter none of the dangers that had hitherto proved\r\nso disastrous. The necessity of this course will be evident when it is\r\nrecollected that all the houses were terraced with flat roofs and\r\nprotecting parapets, which sheltered the assailants, whilst the\r\ninnumerable canals bisecting the streets served as so many pitfalls\r\nfor cavalry, footmen and Indians, when they became confused in the\r\nhurry of a promiscuous onset or retreat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Aztecs within the city suffered the pangs of famine. The\r\nstores that had been gathered for the siege were gone. Human bodies,\r\nroots, rats, reptiles, served for a season, to assuage the famished\r\nstomachs of the starving crowds;--when suddenly, Cortéz despatched\r\nthree Aztec nobles to Guatemozin, who were instructed to praise his\r\ndefence, to assure him he had saved the honor of himself and soldiery,\r\nand to point out the utter uselessness of longer delay in submitting\r\nto inevitable fate. The message of the conqueror was weighed by the\r\ncourt with more favor than by the proud and spirited Emperor, whose\r\npatriotic bosom burned at the disgraceful proposal of surrender. The\r\npriests turned the tide against the white men; and, after two days,\r\nthe answer to the summons came in a warlike sortie from the city which\r\nwell nigh swept the Spanish defenders from the dykes. But cannon and\r\nmusketry were too strong for mere numbers. The vessels poured in their\r\nvolumes of iron hail on the flanks, and the last dread effort of\r\ndefensive despair expired before the unflinching firmness of the\r\nCastilian squadrons. At length, Cortéz believed that the moment for\r\nfinal action had arrived. He gave orders for the advance of the\r\nseveral corps of the army simultaneously by their several causeways;\r\nand although it pained him greatly to destroy a capital which he\r\ndeemed \"the gem of the world,\" yet he put into execution his resolve\r\nto raze the city to its foundation unless it surrendered at\r\ndiscretion. The number of laborers was increased daily by the hosts\r\nthat flocked like vultures to the carcase of an expiring victim. The\r\npalaces, temples and dwellings were plundered, thrown down, and cast\r\ninto the canals The water was entirely excluded from the city. On all\r\nsides there was fast and level land. But the Mexicans were not mere\r\nidle, contemptible spectators of their imperial city's ruin. Day after\r\nday squadrons sallied from the remains of the capital, and engaged the\r\nharrassed invaders. Yet the indomitable constancy of the Spaniards was\r\nnot to be resisted. Cortéz and Alvarado had toiled onward towards each\r\nother, from opposite sides, till they met. The palace of Guatemozin\r\nfell and was burned. The district of Tlatelolco, in the north of the\r\ncity, was reached, and the great market-place secured. One of the\r\ngreat Teocallis, in this quarter, was stormed, its sanctuaries burned,\r\nand the standard of Castile placed on its summit. Havoc, death, ruin,\r\nstarvation, despair, hatred, were every where manifest. Every hour\r\nadded to the misery of the numerous and retreating Aztecs who were\r\npent up, as the besieging circle narrowed and narrowed by its\r\nadvances. Women remained three days and nights up to their necks in\r\nwater among the reeds. Hundreds died daily. Others became insane from\r\nfamine and thirst.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror hoped, for several days, that this disastrous condition\r\nof the people would have induced the Emperor to come to terms; but,\r\nfailing in this, he resolved upon a general assault. Before he\r\nresorted to this dreadful alternative, which his chivalrous heart\r\ntaught him could result only in the slaughter of men so famished,\r\ndispirited and broken, he once more sought an interview with the\r\nEmperor. This was granted; but, at the appointed time, Guatemozin did\r\nnot appear. Again the appeal was renewed, and, again, was Cortéz\r\ndisappointed in the arrival of the sovereign. Nothing, then, remained\r\nfor him but an assault, and, as may readily be imagined, the carnage\r\nin this combined attack of Spaniards and confederate Indians was\r\nindescribably horrible. The long endurance of the Aztecs; their\r\nprolonged resistance and cruelty to the Spaniards; the dreadful\r\nsacrifice of the captives during the entire period of the siege; the\r\nmemory of the first expulsion, and the speedy hope of golden rewards,\r\nnerved the arms and hearts of these ferocious men, and led them on, in\r\nthe work of revenge and conquest, until the sun sunk and night\r\ndescended on the tragic scene.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, 1521, the last appeal was made by Cortéz to the\r\nEmperor for a surrender of his capital. After the bloody scenes of the\r\npreceding day, and the increased misery of the last night, it was not\r\nto be imagined that even insane patriotism or savage madness could\r\ninduce the sovereign to refrain from saving, at least, the\r\nunfortunate non-combatants who still were loyal to his throne and\r\nperson. But the judgment of the conqueror was wrong. \"Guatemozin would\r\ndie where he was!\" was the reply of the royal stoic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the infuriate troops were let loose, and again were the scenes\r\nof the day before re-enacted on the bloody theatre. Many escaped in\r\nboats by the lake; but the brave or reckless Guatemozin, who seems, at\r\nthe last moment, to have changed his mind as to perishing, was taken\r\nprisoner and brought, with his family, into the presence of Cortéz. As\r\nsoon as his noble figure and dignified face were seen on the _azotéa_\r\nor terraced roof, beside the conqueror, the battle ceased. The Indians\r\nbeheld their monarch captive! And she who had witnessed the beginning\r\nof these adventures,--who had followed the fortunes of the General\r\nthrough all their vicissitudes--the gentle but brave Indian\r\ngirl--Mariana--stood by the intrepid Cortéz to act as his interpreter\r\nin this last scene of the splendid and eventful drama.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on the following day that the Mexicans who still survived the\r\nslaughter and famine, evacuated the city. It was a desert--but a\r\ndesert covered with dead. The men who rushed in to plunder,--plundered\r\nas if robbing graves. Between one and two hundred thousand people\r\nperished during the three months' siege, and their festering bodies\r\ntainted the air. The booty, though considerable, was far beneath the\r\nexpectations of the conquerors; yet there was doubtless enough to\r\nreward amply the stout men at arms who had achieved a victory\r\nunparalleled in the annals of modern warfare.\r\n\r\n\"What I am going to say is truth, and I swear, and say Amen to\r\nit!\"--exclaims Bernal Diaz del Castillo, in his quaint style--\"I have\r\nread of the destruction of Jerusalem, but I cannot conceive that the\r\nmortality there exceeded that of Mexico; for all the people from the\r\ndistant provinces, which belonged to this empire, had concentrated\r\nthemselves here, where they mostly died. The streets, and squares, and\r\nhouses, and the courts of the Tlatelolco were covered with dead\r\nbodies; we could not step without treading on them; the lake and\r\ncanals were filled with them, and the stench was intolerable.\r\n\r\n\"When all those who had been able, quitted the city, we went to\r\nexamine it, which was as I have described; and some poor creatures\r\nwere crawling about in different stages of the most offensive\r\ndisorders, the consequences of famine and improper food. There was no\r\nwater; the ground had been torn up and the roots gnawed. The very\r\ntrees were stripped of their bark; yet, notwithstanding they usually\r\ndevoured their prisoners, no instance occurred when, amidst all the\r\nfamine and starvation of this siege, they preyed upon each other.[8]\r\nThe remnant of the population went, at the request of the conquered\r\nGuatemozin, to the neighboring villages, until the town could be\r\npurified and the dead removed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This fact, as stated by Bernal Diaz, is doubted by some\r\nother writers, and seems, unfortunately, not fully sustained by\r\nauthority.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1521.\r\n\r\n    DUTY OF A HISTORIAN.--MOTIVES OF THE CONQUEST.--CHARACTER AND\r\n    DEEDS OF CORTÉZ.--MATERIALS OF THE CONQUEST.--ADVENTURERS--\r\n    PRIESTS--INDIAN ALLIES.--HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF THE CONQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps one of the most difficult duties of a historian, who\r\ndesires to present a faithful picture of a remote age, to place\r\nhimself in such a position as to draw the moral from his story with\r\njustice to the people and the deeds he has described. He is obliged to\r\nforget, not only his individuality and all the associations or\r\nprejudices with which he has grown up surrounded, but he must, in\r\nfact, endeavor to make himself a man and an actor in the age of which\r\nhe writes. He must sympathize justly, but impartially, with the past,\r\nand estimate the motives of his fellow beings in the epoch he\r\ndescribes. He must measure his heroes, not by the standard of advanced\r\nChristian civilization under which he has been educated, but by the\r\nscale of enlightened opinion which was then acknowledged by the most\r\nrespectable and intellectual classes of society.\r\n\r\nWhen we approach the Conquest of Mexico with these impartial feelings,\r\nwe are induced to pass lighter judgments on the prominent men of that\r\nwonderful enterprise. The love of adventure or glory, the passion of\r\navarice, and the zeal of religion,--all of which mingled their threads\r\nwith the meshes of this Indian web, were, unquestionably, the\r\npredominant motives that led the conquerors to Mexico. In some of\r\nthem, a single one of these impulses was sufficient to set the bold\r\nadventurer in motion;--in others, perhaps, they were all combined. The\r\nnecessary rapidity of our narrative has confined us more to the detail\r\nof prominent incidents than we would have desired had it been our task\r\nto disclose the wondrous tale of the conquest alone; but it would be\r\nwrong, even in the briefest summary of the enterprise, to pass from\r\nthe topic without awarding to the moving spirit of the romantic drama\r\nthe fair estimate which his character and deeds demand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have ever regarded Hernando Cortéz as the great controlling spirit\r\nand embodiment of the conquest, regardless of the brilliant and able\r\nmen who were grouped around him, all of whom, tempered and regulated\r\nby his genius, moved the military machine, step by step, and act by\r\nact, until the capital fell before the united armies of discontented\r\nIndians and invading Spaniards. It was in the mind of this remarkable\r\npersonage that every scheme appears to have originated and ripened.\r\nThis is the report of the most authentic contemporaries. He took\r\ncounsel, it is true, of his captains, and heard the reports of\r\nSandoval, Olid, and Alvarado; but whenever a great enterprise, in all\r\nthe wonderful and varied combinations of this adventure, was to be\r\ncarried into successful execution, it was Cortéz himself who planned\r\nit, placed himself at its head, and fought in its midst. The rash\r\nyouth whom we saw either idling over his tasks at school, or a\r\nreckless stripling as he advanced in life, seems to have mellowed\r\nsuddenly into greatness under the glow of Indian suns which would have\r\nemasculated a character of less rude or nervous strength. As soon as a\r\nproject, worthy of the real power of his genius, presented itself to\r\nhis mind and opened to his grasp, he became a sobered, steadfast,\r\nserious, discreet man. He was at once isolated by his superiority, and\r\ncontrived to retain, by his wisdom in command, the superiority which\r\nwas so perfectly manifested by this isolation. This alone, was no\r\ntrifling task. His natural adroitness not only taught him quickly the\r\nvalue of every man in his command, but also rendered keener the tact\r\nby which he strove to use those men when their talents, for good or\r\nevil, were once completely ascertained. There were jealousies of\r\nCortéz, but no rivalries. _Men from the ranks_ conspired to displace\r\nhim, but no _leader_ ever ventured, or perhaps even conceived the\r\nidea, whilst under his orders, of superceding the hero of the Mexican\r\nconquest. The skill with which he won the loyal heart of that clever\r\nIndian girl--his mistress and companion through all the\r\nwarfare,--discloses to us his power of attaching a sex which is always\r\nquickest to detect merit and readiest to discard conceit. We speak now\r\nof Cortéz during that period of his career when he was essentially the\r\nsoul of the conquest, and in which the stern demands of war upon his\r\nintellect and heart, did not allow him to sleep for a moment on his\r\npost, or to tamper with the elements upon which he relied for success.\r\nIn all this time he made but few mistakes. The loss of the capital\r\nduring the first visit is not to be attributed to him. The stain of\r\nthat calamity must rest forever upon the escutcheon of Alvarado, for\r\nthe irreparable harm was already done when Cortéz returned from the\r\nsubjugation of Narvaez.\r\n\r\nNor is it alone as a soldier, at this time, that we are called on to\r\nappreciate the talents of our hero. Whilst he planned, fought,\r\ntravelled, retreated, and diplomatised, he kept an accurate account of\r\nthe adventures of his troop; and, in his celebrated letters to the\r\nEmperor, he has presented us a series of military memoirs, which,\r\nafter three hundred years, furnish, in reality, the best, but least\r\npretending, narrative of the conquest. Other contemporaries, looking\r\nupon the scenes from a variety of points, may serve to add interesting\r\ndetails and more copious illustration to the story; but they support\r\nwithout diminishing the value and truth of the despatches of Cortéz.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror, in truth, was one of those men whose minds seem to\r\nreach results intuitively. Education often ripens genius, as the\r\ngenial sun and air mature the fruits of the earth which would languish\r\nwithout them. But we sometimes find individuals whose dealings on\r\nearth are to be chiefly in energetic and constant action with their\r\nfellow creatures, and who are gifted with a finer tact which enables\r\nthem to penetrate the hearts of all they approach, and by this skilful\r\ndetection of character are empowered to mould them to their purposes.\r\nThere are, it is true, many subordinate qualities, besides the mere\r\nperceptive faculties, that are needful in such a person. He must\r\npossess self-control and discrimination in a remarkable degree. His\r\ncourage and self-reliance must be unquestionable. He must be able to\r\nwin by gentleness as well as to control by command or to rule by\r\nstratagem; for there are persons whom neither kindness, reason nor\r\nauthority can lead, but who are nevertheless too important to be\r\ndisregarded in such an enterprise as that of the conquest of Mexico.\r\n\r\nNor is our admiration of the characteristics we have endeavored to\r\nsketch, diminished when we examine the elements of the original army\r\nthat flocked to the standard of Cortéz. The Spanish court and\r\ncamps,--the Spanish towns and sea-ports,--had sent forth a motley band\r\nto the islands. The sedate and worthier portions of Castilian society\r\nwere not wooed abroad by the alluring accounts of the New World and its\r\nprolific wealth. They did not choose to leave hereditary homes and\r\ncomfortable emoluments which made those homes the permanent abodes of\r\ncontentment if not of luxury. But there were others in the dense crowds\r\nof Spain whose habits, disposition and education, fostered in them all\r\nthe love of ease and elegance, without bestowing the means of gratifying\r\ntheir desires. These men regarded the New World as a short and easy road\r\nto opulence and distinction. There were others too, whose reckless or\r\ndissipated habits had wasted their fortunes and blasted their names in\r\ntheir native towns, and who could not bear to look upon the scenes of\r\ntheir youth, or the companions of their more fortunate days, whilst\r\npoverty and disgrace deprived them of the rights of free and equal\r\nsocial intercourse. These were the poor and proud;--the noisy and the\r\nriotous;--the soldier, half bandit, half warrior;--the sailor, half\r\nmutineer, half pirate;--the zealot whose bigotry magnified the dangers\r\nof Indian life into the glory of martyrdom; and the avaricious man who\r\ndreamed that the very sands of the Indian Isles were strewn with gems\r\nand gold. Among all this mass of wayward lust and ambition, there were\r\nsome lofty spirits whose love of glory, whose passionate devotion to\r\nadventure, and whose genuine anxiety to spread the true word of God\r\namong the infidels, sanctified and adorned the enterprise, whilst their\r\npersonal efforts and influence were continually directed towards the\r\nnoble purpose of redeeming it from cruelty. These men recollected that\r\nposterity would set its seal upon their deeds, whilst many of them acted\r\nfrom a higher and purer Christian motive, devoid of all that narrow\r\nselfishness with which others kept their eyes fixed on the present and\r\nthe future for the popular opinion that was to disgrace or dignify them\r\non the pages of history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch were the Spanish materials of the armies with which Cortéz\r\ninvaded Mexico; and yet, even with all the masterly genius he\r\npossessed to mould and lead such discordant elements, what could he\r\nhave substantially effected, against the Aztec Empire, with his\r\nhandful of men,--armed, mounted and equipped as they were,--without\r\nhis _Indian allies_? These he had to conquer, to win, to control, to\r\nbind to him, forever, with the chains of an indestructible loyalty. He\r\ndid not even know their language, but relied on the double\r\ninterpretation of an Indian girl and a Spanish soldier. Nor is it less\r\nremarkable that he not only gained these allies, but preserved their\r\nfealty, not in success alone, but under the most disheartening\r\ndisaster, when it was really their interest to destroy rather than to\r\nsustain him, and when not only their allegiance but their religion\r\ninvoked a dreadful vengeance on the sacreligious hands that despoiled\r\ntheir temples, overthrew their Gods, and made a jest of their most\r\nsacred rites. It was, indeed, not only a victory over the judgments,\r\nbut over the superstitions, of an excitable, ardent and perhaps\r\nunreflective nation; and, in whatever aspect we regard the man who\r\neffected it solely by the omnipotence of his will, we are more and\r\nmore forced to admire the majesty of his genius and the fortune or\r\nprovidence that made him a chosen and conspicuous instrument in the\r\ndevelopment of our continent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Mexico,--in its relation to the rest of the world,--has\r\na double aspect, worthy of examination. The subsequent history and\r\ncondition of the country, which we design to treat in the following\r\npages, will develope one of these topics;--the condition of the country,\r\nat the period of the conquest, will disclose another, whilst it\r\npalliates, if it does not altogether apologize for the cruelties and\r\napparent rapine by which the subjugation of the empire was effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1521-1522.\r\n\r\n    DISCONTENT AT NOT FINDING GOLD--TORTURE OF GUATEMOZIN.--RESULTS OF\r\n    THE FALL OF THE CAPITAL.--MISSION FROM MICHOACAN.--REBUILDING OF\r\n    THE CAPITAL.--LETTERS TO THE KING.--INTRIGUES AGAINST\r\n    CORTÉZ--FONSECA--NARVAEZ---TAPIA.--CHARLES V. PROTECTS CORTÉZ AND\r\n    CONFIRMS HIS ACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capital had no sooner fallen and the ruins been searched in vain\r\nfor the abundant treasures which the conquerors imagined were hoarded\r\nby the Aztecs, than murmurs of discontent broke forth in the Spanish\r\ncamp against Cortéz for his supposed concealment of the plunder. There\r\nwas a mingled sentiment of distrust both of the conqueror and\r\nGuatemozin; and, at last, the querulousness and taunts rose to such an\r\noffensive height, that it was resolved to apply the torture to the\r\ndethroned prince in order to wrest from him the secret hiding place of\r\nhis ancestral wealth. We blush to record that Cortéz consented to this\r\niniquity, but it was probably owing to an avaricious and mutinous\r\nspirit in his ranks which he was unable at the moment to control. The\r\nsame Indian stoicism that characterised the unfortunate prince during\r\nthe war, still nerved him in his hours of abject disaster. He bore the\r\npangs without quivering or complaint and without revealing any thing\r\nthat could gratify the Spanish lust of gold, save that vast quantities\r\nof the precious metal had been thrown into the lake,--from which but\r\nlittle was ultimately recovered even by the most expert divers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe news of the fall of Mexico was soon spread from sea to sea, and\r\ncouriers were despatched by distant tribes and princes to ascertain\r\nthe truth of the prodigious disaster. The independent kingdom of\r\nMichoacan, lying between the vale of Anahuac or Mexico and the\r\nPacific, was one of the first to send its envoys, and finally even\r\nits king, to the capital;--and two small detachments of Spaniards\r\nreturned with the new visitors, penetrating their country and passing\r\nwith them even to the waters of the western ocean itself, on whose\r\nshores they planted the cross in token of rightful possession. They\r\nreturned by the northern districts, and brought with them the first\r\nspecimens of gold and pearls from the region now known as California.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before Cortéz resolved to make his conquest\r\navailable by the reconstruction of the capital that he had been forced\r\nreluctantly to mutilate and partly level during the siege. The ancient\r\ncity was nearly in ruins. The massive relics of idolatry, and the huge\r\nstones of which the chief palaces had been constructed, were cast into\r\nthe canals. The desolation was complete on the site of the ancient\r\nimperial residence. And the Indians, who had served in the work of\r\ndilapidation, were even compelled by their Spanish leader and his task\r\nmasters to be the principal laborers in the toil of building up a city\r\nwhich should surpass in splendor the ancient pride of Anahuac.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sagacious mind of Cortéz was not only busy with the\r\npresent duties and occupations of his men in Mexico, but began to\r\ndwell,--now that the intense excitement of active war was over,--upon\r\nthe condition of his relations with the Spanish Court and the\r\ngovernment in the islands. He despatched to Castile, letters,\r\npresents, and the \"royal fifth,\" together with an enormous emerald\r\nwhose base was as broad as the palm of his hand. With the General's\r\nmissives, went a letter from his army, commending the heroic leader,\r\nand beseeching its royal master to confirm Cortéz in his authority and\r\nto ratify all his proceedings. Quinoñes and Avila, the two envoys,\r\nsailed for home; but one of them, lucklessly, perished in a brawl at\r\nthe Azores, whilst Avila, who resumed the voyage to Spain, after the\r\nloss of his companion, was taken by a French privateer, who bore the\r\nspoils of the Mexicans to the Court of Francis the First. The letters\r\nand despatches of Cortéz and his army, however, were saved, and Avila,\r\nprivately and safely forwarded them to the Spanish sovereign.\r\n\r\nAt the Court of Charles the Fifth there were, of course, numerous\r\nintrigues against the successful conqueror. The hatred of Velasquez\r\nhad not been suffered to slumber in the breast of that disappointed\r\ngovernor, and Fonseca, Bishop of Burgos, who was chief of the colonial\r\ndepartment, and doubtless adroitly plied and stimulated by Velasquez,\r\nmanaged to obtain from the churchman, Adrian, who was Regent whilst\r\nthe Emperor resided in Germany, an order for the seizure of Cortéz and\r\nthe sequestration of his property until the will of the court should\r\nbe finally made known.\r\n\r\nBut, the avaricious Velasquez, the vindictive Fonseca, and the\r\n_Veedor_ Cristoval de Tapia, whom they employed to execute so delicate\r\nand dangerous a commission against a man who at that moment, was\r\nsurrounded by faithful soldiers and whose troops had been augmented by\r\nrecent arrivals at Vera Cruz,--reasoned with but little judgment when\r\nthey planned their unjust and ungrateful measures against Cortéz. The\r\ncommissioner, himself, seems to have soon arrived at the same\r\nconclusion, for, scarcely had he landed, before the danger of the\r\nenterprise and the gold of the conqueror, persuaded him prudently to\r\ndecline penetrating into the heart of the country as the bearer of so\r\nungrateful a reply to the wishes of a hero whose genius and sword had\r\ngiven an empire, and almost a world, to Spain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, at last, was Cortéz, for a time, freed from the active hostility\r\nof the Spanish Court, whilst he retained his authority over his\r\nconquest merely by military right and power of forcible occupation.\r\nBut he did not remain idly contented with what he had already done.\r\nHis restless heart craved to compass the whole continent, and to\r\ndiscover, visit, explore, whatever lay within the reach of his small\r\nforces and of all who chose to swell them. He continually pressed his\r\nIndian visitors for information concerning the empire of the\r\nMontezumas and the adjacent territories of independent kings or\r\ntributaries. Wherever discontent lifted its head, or rebellious\r\nmanifestations were made, he despatched sufficient forces to whip the\r\nmutineers into contrite submission. The new capital progressed apace,\r\nand stately edifices rose on the solid land which his soldiers had\r\nformed out of the fragments of ancient Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus engaged in his newly-acquired domain, Narvaez, his old\r\nenemy, and Tapia, his more recent foe, had reached the Spanish Court,\r\nwhere, aided by Fonseca, they once more bestirred themselves in the\r\nfoul labor of blasting the fame of Cortéz, and wresting from his grasp\r\nthe splendid fruits of his valor. Luckily, however, the Emperor\r\nreturned, about this period, from eastern Europe, and, from this\r\nmoment the tide of intrigue seems to have been stayed if not\r\naltogether turned. Reviled as he had hitherto been in the purlieus of\r\nthe court, Cortéz was not without staunch kinsmen and warm friends who\r\nstood up valiantly in his behalf, both before councils and king. His\r\nfather, Don Martin, and his friend, the Duke of Bejar, had been\r\nprominent among many in espousing the cause of the absent hero, even\r\nbefore the sovereign's return;--and now, the monarch, whose heart was\r\nnot indeed ungrateful for the effectual service rendered his throne by\r\nthe conqueror, and whose mind probably saw not only the justice but\r\nthe policy of preserving, unalienated, the fidelity and services of so\r\nremarkable a personage,--soon determined to look leniently upon all\r\nthat was really censurable in the early deeds of Cortéz. Whilst\r\nCharles confirmed his acts in their full extent, he moreover\r\nconstituted him \"Governor, Captain General and Chief Justice of New\r\nSpain, with power to appoint to all offices, civil and military, and\r\nto order any person to leave the country whose residence there might\r\nbe deemed prejudicial to the crown.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of October, 1522, this righteous commission was signed by\r\nCharles V., at Valladolid. A liberal salary was assigned the Captain\r\nGeneral; his leading officers were crowned with honors and emoluments,\r\nand the troops were promised liberal grants of land. Thus, the wisdom\r\nof the king, and of the most respectable Spanish nobility, finally\r\ncrushed the mean, jealous, or avaricious spirits who had striven to\r\nleave their slimy traces on the fame of the conqueror; whilst the\r\nEmperor, himself, with his own hand, acknowledged the services of the\r\ntroops and their leader, in a letter to the Spanish army in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who felt severely the censure implied by this just and\r\nwise conduct of Charles V., was the ascetic Bishop of Burgos, Fonseca,\r\nwhose baleful influence had fallen alike upon the discoveries of\r\nColumbus, and the conquests of Cortéz. His bigoted and narrow\r\nsoul,--schooled in forms, and trained by early discipline, into a\r\nquerulousness which could neither tolerate anything that did not\r\naccord with his rules or originate under his orders,--was unable to\r\ncomprehend the splendid glory of the enterprises of these two heroic\r\nchieftains. Had it been his generous policy to foster them, history\r\nwould have selected this son of the church as the guardian angel over\r\nthe cradle of the New World; but he chose to be the shadow rather than\r\nthe shining light of his era, and, whether from age or chagrin, he\r\ndied in the year after this kingly rebuff from a prince whose councils\r\nhe had long and unwisely served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1522-1547.\r\n\r\n    CORTÉZ COMMISSIONED BY THE EMPEROR.--VELASQUEZ--HIS DEATH.--MEXICO\r\n    REBUILT.--IMMIGRATION--REPARTIMIENTOS OF INDIANS.--HONDURAS--\r\n    GUATEMOZIN--MARIANA.--CORTÉZ ACCUSED--ORDERED TO SPAIN FOR\r\n    TRIAL.--HIS RECEPTION, HONORS AND TITLES--HE MARRIES--HIS\r\n    RETURN TO MEXICO--RESIDES AT TEZCOCO.--EXPEDITIONS OF\r\n    CORTÉZ--CALIFORNIA--QUIVARA.--RETURNS TO SPAIN--DEATH--WHERE ARE\r\n    HIS BONES?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal commission, of which we have spoken in the last chapter, was\r\nspeedily borne to New Spain, where it was joyfully received by all who\r\nhad participated in the conquest or joined the original forces since\r\nthat event. Men not only recognized the justice of the act, but they\r\nfelt that if the harvest was rightfully due to him who had planted the\r\nseed, it was also most probable that no one could be found in Spain or\r\nthe Islands more capable than Cortéz of consolidating the new empire.\r\nVelasquez, the darling object of whose latter years had been to\r\ncircumvent, entrap or foil the conqueror, was sadly stricken by the\r\ndefeat of his machinations. The reckless but capable soldier, whom he\r\ndesigned to mould into the pliant tool of his avarice and glory, had\r\nsuddenly become his master. Wealth, renown, and even royal gratitude,\r\ncrowned his labors; and the disobedience, the errors, and the flagrant\r\nwrongs he was charged with whilst subject to gubernatorial authority,\r\nwere passed by in silence or forgotten in the acclamation that sounded\r\nhis praise throughout Spain and Europe. Even Fonseca,--the chief of\r\nthe council,--had been unable to thwart this darling of genius and\r\ngood fortune. Velasquez, himself, was nothing. The great error of his\r\nlife had been in breaking with Cortéz before he sailed for Mexico. He\r\nwas straitened in fortune, foiled in ambition, mocked by the men whose\r\ncareer of dangerous adventure he had personally failed to share; and,\r\nat last, disgusted with the time and its men, he retired to brood over\r\nhis melancholy reverses until death soon relieved him of his earthly\r\njealousies and annoyances.\r\n\r\nFour years had not entirely elapsed since the fall of Mexico, when a\r\nnew and splendid city rose from its ruins and attracted the eager\r\nSpaniards, of all classes, from the old world and the islands. Cortéz\r\ndesigned this to be the continental nucleus of population. Situated on\r\nthe central plateau of the realm, midway between the two seas, in a\r\ngenial climate whose heat never scorched and whose cold never froze,\r\nit was, indeed, an alluring region to which men of all temperaments\r\nmight resort with safety. Strongholds, churches, palaces, were erected\r\non the sites of the royal residences of the Aztecs and their\r\nblood-stained Teocallis. Strangers were next invited to the new\r\ncapital, and, in a few years, the Spanish quarter contained two\r\nthousand families, while the Indian district of Tlatelolco, numbered\r\nnot less than thirty thousand inhabitants. The city soon assumed the\r\nair and bustle of a great mart. Tradesmen, craftsmen and merchants,\r\nthronged its streets and remaining canals.\r\n\r\nCortéz was not less anxious to establish, in the interior of the old\r\nAztec empire, towns or points of rendezvous, which in the course of\r\ntime, would grow up into important cities. These were placed with a\r\nview to the future wants of travel and trade in New Spain. Liberal\r\ngrants of land were made to settlers who were compelled to provide\r\nthemselves with wives under penalty of forfeiture within eighteen\r\nmonths. Celibacy was too great a luxury for a young country.[9] The\r\nIndians were divided among the Spaniards by the system of\r\n_repartimientos_, which will be more fully discussed in a subsequent\r\npart of this work. The necessities and cupidity of the early settlers\r\nin so vast a region rendered this necessary perhaps, though it was\r\npromptly discountenanced but never successfully suppressed by the\r\nSpanish crown. The scene of action was too remote, the subjects too\r\nselfish, and the ministers too venal or interested to carry out, with\r\nfidelity, the benign ordinances of the government at home. From this\r\napportionment of Indians, which subjected them, in fact, to a species\r\nof slavery, it is but just to the conquerors to state that the\r\nTlascalans, upon whom the burden of the fighting had fallen, were\r\nentirely exempted at the recommendation of Cortéz.\r\n\r\nAmong all the tribes the work of conversion prospered, for the\r\nceremonious ritual of the Aztec religion easily introduced the native\r\nworshippers to the splendid forms of the Roman Catholic. Agriculture\r\nand the mines were not neglected in the policy of Cortéz, and, in\r\nfact he speedily set in motion all the machinery of civilization,\r\nwhich was gradually to operate upon the native population whilst it\r\nattracted the overflowing, industrious or adventurous masses of his\r\nnative land. Various expeditions, too, for the purpose of exploration\r\nand extension, were fitted out by the Captain General of New Spain; so\r\nthat, within three years after the conquest, Cortéz had reduced to the\r\nSpanish sway, a territory of over four hundred leagues, or twelve\r\nhundred miles on the Atlantic coast, and of more than five hundred\r\nleagues or fifteen hundred miles on the Pacific.[10]\r\n\r\nThis sketch of a brief period after the subjugation of Mexico\r\ndevelopes the _constructive_ genius of Cortéz, as the preceding\r\nchapters had very fully exhibited his _destructive_ abilities. It\r\nshows, however, that he was not liable justly to the censure which has\r\nso often been cast upon him,--of being, only, a piratical plunderer\r\nwho was seduced into the conquest by the spirit of rapine alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a historical narrative which is designed to treat exclusively of\r\nMexico, it might perhaps be considered inappropriate to relate that\r\nportion of the biography of Cortéz which is covered by his expedition\r\nto Honduras, whither he marched after he learned the defection of his\r\nlieutenant Olid whom he had sent to that distant region with a body of\r\nSpanish soldiers to found a dependant colony. It was whilst on this\r\ndisastrous march that the report of a conspiracy to slay the\r\nSpaniards, in which Guatemozin was implicated, reached his ears, and\r\nthat the dethroned monarch, together with several princes and inferior\r\nnobles, was hanged, by his orders, on the branches of a tree. There is\r\na difference of opinion among contemporary writers as to the guilt of\r\nGuatemozin and the Aztec nobles; but it is probable that the\r\nunfortunate prince had become a dangerous and formidable captive and\r\nthat the grave was a safer prison for such a personage, than the tents\r\nand bivouacs of a menaced army.\r\n\r\nAnother renowned character in this drama--the serviceable and gentle\r\nIndian girl Doña Mariana,--was no longer needed and was disposed of\r\nduring this expedition, by marriage with Don Martin Xamarillo, to whom\r\nshe brought a noble dowry of estates, which were assigned her by the\r\nconqueror in her native province, where, in all likelihood she ended\r\nher romantic career. Her son by Cortéz, named after his grand-father\r\nDon Martin, became distinguished in the annals of the colony and of\r\nSpain, but in 1568, he was cruelly treated in the capital which had\r\nbeen won by the valor and fidelity of his parents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this digression in his Mexican career, Cortéz was suddenly\r\nrecalled by the news of disturbances in the capital, which he reached\r\nafter a tempestuous and dangerous voyage. His journey from the coast\r\nto the valley was a continued scene of triumphs; and, from Tezcoco, in\r\nJune, 1526, he made his stately entrance into the city of Mexico amid\r\nbrilliant cavalcades, decorated streets, and lakes and canals covered\r\nwith the fanciful skiffs of Indians.\r\n\r\nA month later, the joy of his rapturous reception was disturbed by the\r\nannouncement that the Spanish Court had sent a commissioner to\r\nsupercede him temporarily in the government. The work of sapping his\r\npower and influence had long been carried on at home; and false\r\nreports, involving Cortéz in extreme dishonesty not only to the\r\nsubjects but to the crown of Spain itself, at length infused\r\nsuspicions into the sovereign's mind. The Emperor resolved to search\r\nthe matter fairly to its core, and, accordingly, despatched Don Luis\r\nPonce de Leon, a young, but able nobleman to perform this delicate\r\ntask, at the same time that he wrote with his own hand to the\r\nconqueror, assuring him that his sole design was not to distrust or\r\ndeprive him of his honors, but to afford him the opportunity of\r\nplacing his integrity in a clear light before the world.\r\n\r\nDe Leon, and the delegate chosen on his death bed, died within a few\r\nmonths, and were succeeded by Estrada, the royal treasurer, who was\r\nhostile to Cortéz, and whose malicious mismanagement of the\r\ninvestigation soon convinced even the Spanish court that it was unjust\r\nto leave so delicate and tangled a question in his hands. Accordingly\r\nthe affair was transferred from Estrada to a commission styled the\r\nAudiencia Real de España, and Cortéz was commanded to hasten across\r\nthe Atlantic in order to vindicate himself from the aspersions before\r\nthis august body, which sat in the midst of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nCortéz resolved to go at once; and, loyal to the last, rejected all\r\nthe offers that were made him to reassume the reins of power,\r\n_independently of Spain_. He carried with him a number of natives,\r\ntogether with specimens of all the natural and artificial products of\r\nhis viceroyalty; nor did he forget a plentiful supply of gold, silver,\r\nand jewels, with which he might maintain, in the eyes of his luxurious\r\ncountrymen, the state that was appropriate for one whose conquests\r\nand acquisitions were so extensive. Sandoval and Tapia, too, departed\r\nwith their beloved companion in arms, the former of whom, only, lived\r\nto land once more on his native land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he journeyed from the sea-port towards Toledo, the curious crowds\r\npoured out on the way side to behold and welcome the hero of the New\r\nWorld; and from the gates of the city a gallant crowd of cavaliers\r\npoured forth, with the Duke de Bejar and the Count de Aguilar, to\r\nattend him to his dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor received him with marked respect on the following day, and\r\nfrom the bountiful gifts and splendid titles which were showered upon\r\nCortéz before the close of 1529, it seems that his sovereign was soon\r\npersonally satisfied in his frequent and frank interviews with the\r\nconqueror, that the tales he had heard from across the sea were mere\r\ncalumnies unworthy his notice. The title of \"Marquis of the Valley of\r\nOaxaca\" was bestowed on him. Lands in the rich province of Oaxaca, and\r\nestates in the city of Mexico and other places, were also ceded to\r\nhim. \"The princely domain thus granted him,\" says Prescott,\r\n\"comprehended more than twenty towns and villages and twenty-three\r\nthousand vassals.\" The court and sovereign vied with each other in\r\nhonoring and appreciating his services, and every privilege was no\r\nsooner demanded than granted, save that of again assuming the\r\ngovernment of New Spain!\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the Spanish court not to entrust the rule of\r\nconquered countries to the men who had subdued them. There was\r\nfancied, and perhaps real danger in confiding such dearly acquired\r\njewels to ambitious and daring adventurers who might ripen into\r\ndisloyal usurpers.\r\n\r\nCortéz bowed submissively to the will of the Emperor. He was grateful\r\nfor what had been graciously conceded to his merits and services; nor\r\nwas he unwilling to enjoy the luxury of careless repose after so many\r\nyears of toil. His first wife,--wedded as we have related in the\r\nIslands,--died a short time after she joined him in the capital after\r\nthe conquest. Cortéz was yet young, nor was he ill favored or\r\nindisposed to slight the charms of the sex. A fair relative of the\r\nAguilars and Bejars, Doña Juana Zuñiga, at this moment attracted his\r\nattention and was soon won. Her dower of jewels, wrested from the\r\nAztecs, and carved by their most skilful workmen, was indescribably\r\nmagnificent, and, after her splendid nuptials, she embarked, in 1530,\r\nwith the conqueror and his aged mother to return to the Indian\r\nIslands, and finally to New Spain.\r\n\r\nAt Hispaniola he met an Audiencia Real, which was still to have\r\njurisdiction of his case, if it ever came to trial, and at whose head\r\nwas an avowed enemy of the conqueror, Nuño de Guzman. The evidence was\r\ntaken upon eight scandalous charges against Cortéz, and is of so\r\nsuspicious a character that it not only disgusts the general reader,\r\nbut also failed in its effect upon the Spanish court by which no\r\naction was finally taken in regard to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortéz remained two months in the island before he set sail for Vera\r\nCruz, in July 1530; and, in the meantime, the Bishop of San Domingo\r\nwas selected to preside over a new Audiencia, inasmuch as the conduct\r\nof the late Audiencia, and of Guzman especially, in relation to the\r\nIndians, had become so odiously oppressive that fears were entertained\r\nof an outbreak. The bishop and his coadjutors were men of a different\r\nstamp, who inspired the conqueror with better hopes for the future\r\nprosperity of the Indian colonies.\r\n\r\nSo jealous was the home government of the dangerous influence of\r\nCortéz,--a man so capable of establishing for himself an independent\r\nempire in the New World,--that he had been inhibited from approaching\r\nthe capital nearer than thirty leagues. But this did not prevent the\r\npeople from approaching him. He returned to the scene of his conquest,\r\nwith all the personal resentments and annoyances that had been felt by\r\nindividuals of old, softened by the lapse of time during his prolonged\r\nabsence in Spain. He came back, too, with all the prestige of his\r\nEmperor's favor; and, thus, both by the new honors he had won at\r\ncourt, and the memory of his deeds, the masses felt disposed to\r\nacknowledge, at the moment of joyous meeting, that it was alone to him\r\nthey owed their possessions, their wealth, their comfort, and their\r\nimportance in New Spain.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mexico was deserted by the courtiers, and Tezcoco, where\r\nhe established his headquarters was thronged by eager crowds who came\r\nnot only to visit but to consult the man whose wit and wisdom were as\r\nkeen as his sword, and who revisited Mexico, ripened into an astute\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the seeming cordiality between the magistrates of the\r\ncapital and the partly exiled Captain General, did not long continue.\r\nOccasions arose for difference of opinion and for disputes of even a\r\nmore bitter character, until, at length, he turned his back on the\r\nglorious valley,--the scene of his noblest exploits,--forever, and took\r\nup his abode in his town of Cuernavaca, which, it will be recollected,\r\nhe captured from the Aztecs before the capital fell into his hands. This\r\nwas a place lying in the lap of a beautiful valley, sheltered from the\r\nnorth winds and fronting the genial sun of the south, and here he once\r\nmore returned to the cares of agriculture,--introducing the sugar cane\r\nfrom Cuba, encouraging the cultivation of flax and hemp, and teaching\r\nthe people the value of lands, cattle and husbandry which they had never\r\nknown or fully appreciated. Gold and silver he drew from Zacatecas and\r\nTehuantepec; but he seems to have wisely thought that the permanent\r\nwealth and revenue of himself and his heirs would best be found in\r\ntillage.\r\n\r\nOur limits will not permit us to dwell upon the agricultural, mineral\r\nand commercial speculations of Cortéz, nor upon his various adventures\r\nin Mexico. It is sufficient to say that he planned several\r\nexpeditions, the most important of which, was unsuccessful in\r\nconsequence of his necessary absence in Spain, whither he had been\r\ndriven, as we have seen, to defend himself against the attacks of his\r\nenemies. Immediately, however, upon his return to Mexico, he not only\r\nsent forth various navigators, to make further discoveries, but\r\ndeparted himself for the coast of Jalisco, which he visited in 1534\r\nand 1535. He recovered a ship, which had been seized by Nuño de\r\nGuzman; and having assembled the vessels he had commanded to be built\r\nin Tehuantepec, he embarked every thing needful to found a colony. The\r\nsufferings he experienced in this expedition were extraordinarily\r\ngreat; his little fleet was assailed by famine and tempests, and, so\r\nlong was he unheard of, in Mexico, that, at the earnest instance of\r\nhis wife, the viceroy Mendoza sent two vessels to search for him. He\r\nreturned, at length, to Acapulco; but not content with his luckless\r\nefforts, he made arrangements for a new examination of the coasts, by\r\nFrancisco de Ulloa, which resulted in the discovery of California, as\r\nfar as the Isle de Cedros, and of all that gulf, to which geographers\r\nhave given the name of the \"Sea of Cortéz.\"\r\n\r\nHis expenses in these expeditions exceeded three hundred thousand\r\ncastellanos of gold, which were never returned to him by the\r\ngovernment of Spain. Subsequently, a Franciscan missionary, Fray\r\nMarcos de Niza, reported the discovery, north of Sonoma, of a rich and\r\npowerful nation called Quivara, whose capital he represented as\r\nenjoying an almost European civilization. Cortéz claimed his right to\r\ntake part in or command an expedition which the viceroy Mendoza was\r\nfitting out for its conquest. But he was baulked in his wishes, and\r\nwas obliged to confine his future efforts for Mexico to works of\r\nbeneficence in the capital.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the conqueror's life which impressed its powerful\r\ncharacteristics upon New Spain was now over. The rest of his story\r\nbelongs rather to biography and the Old World than to a compressed\r\nnarrative of Mexican history, for although he remained long in the\r\ncountry, and afterwards fought successfully under the Emperor's banner\r\nin other lands, it appears that he was unable to win the Spanish crown\r\nto grant him authority over the empire he had subdued. He died at\r\nCastilleja de la Cuesta, near Seville, on the 2d of December, 1547.\r\n\r\nCortéz provided in his will that his body should be interred in the\r\nplace where he died, if that event occurred in Spain, and that, within\r\nten years, his bones should be removed to New Spain and deposited in a\r\nconvent of Franciscan nuns, which, under the name of La Concepcion, he\r\nordered to be founded in Cuyoacan. Accordingly, his corpse was first\r\nof all laid in the convent of San Isidro, outside the walls of\r\nSeville, whence it was carried to Mexico and deposited in the church\r\nof San Francisco, at Tezcoco, inasmuch as the convent of Cuyoacan was\r\nnot yet built. Thence the ashes of the hero were carried, in 1629, to\r\nthe principal chapel of the church of San Francis, in the capital;\r\nand, at last, were translated, on the 8th of November, 1794, to the\r\nchurch of the Hospital of Jesus, which Cortéz had founded. When the\r\nrevolution broke out, a vindictive feeling prevailed not only against\r\nthe living Spaniards, but against the dead, and men were found, who\r\ninvoked the people to tear these honored relics from their grave, and\r\nafter burning them at San Lazaro, to scatter the hated ashes to the\r\nwinds. But, in the government and among the principal citizens, there\r\nwere many individuals who eagerly sought an opportunity to save Mexico\r\nfrom this disgraceful act. These persons secretly removed the\r\nmonument, tablet, and remains of the conqueror from their resting\r\nplace in the Church of Jesus, and there is reason to believe, that at\r\nlength they repose in peaceful concealment in the vaults of the family\r\nin Italy. Past generations deprived him, whilst living, of the right\r\nto rule the country he had won by his valor. Modern Mexico has denied\r\nhis corpse even the refuge of a grave.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Prescott 3d, 261.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Prescott, vol. 3, 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See Alaman, Disertaciones sobre la historia de la\r\nRepublica Mexicana, vol. 2, p. 93 Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n650-1500.\r\n\r\n    ARCHBISHOP ZUMARRAGA'S DESTRUCTION OF MEXICAN MONUMENTS, WRITINGS,\r\n    DOCUMENTS--MR.

He collected from all\r\nquarters, but especially from Tezcoco, where the national archives were\r\ndeposited, all the Indian manuscripts he could discover, and causing\r\nthem to be piled in a great heap in the market place of Tlatelolco, he\r\nburned all these precious records, which under the skilful\r\ninterpretation of competent natives, _might_ have relieved the early\r\nhistory of the Aztecs from the obscurity with which it is now clouded.\r\nThe superstitious soldiery eagerly imitated the pious example of this\r\nprelate, and emulated each other in destroying all the books, charts,\r\nand papers, which bore hieroglyphic signs, whose import, they had been\r\ntaught to believe was as sacrilegiously symbolic and pernicious as that\r\nof the idols they had already hurled from the Indian temples.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it may be questioned, whether these documents, had they been\r\nspared even as the curious relics of the literature or art of a\r\nsemi-civilized people, would have enlightened the path of the\r\nhistorical student. \"It has been shown,\" says Mr. Gallatin, \"that\r\nthose which have been preserved contain but a meagre account of the\r\nMexican history for the one hundred years preceding the conquest, and\r\nhardly anything that relates to prior events. The question naturally\r\narises--from what source those writers derived their information, who\r\nhave attempted to write not only the modern history of Mexico, but\r\nthat of ancient times? It may, without hesitation, be answered, that\r\ntheir information was traditional. The memory of important events is\r\ngenerally preserved and transmitted by songs and ballads, in those\r\nnations which have attained a certain degree of civilization, and had\r\nnot the use of letters. Unfortunately, if we except the hymns of the\r\ngreat monarch of Tezcoco, which are of recent date, and allude to no\r\nhistorical fact of an earlier epoch than his own times, no such\r\nMexican remnants have been transmitted to us, or published. On the\r\nother hand the recollection and oral transmission of events may have\r\nbeen aided by the hieroglyphics imperfect as they were; thus, those of\r\nthe significant names of a king and of a city, together with the\r\nsymbol of the year, would remind the Mexicans of the history of the\r\nwar of that king against that city which had been early taught him\r\nwhilst a student in the temple.\"[12]\r\n\r\nIt is thus, perhaps, that the virtuoso rather than the historical\r\nstudent has been the sufferer by the superstitious conflagrations of\r\nZumarraga and the Spanish soldiers. We have unquestionably lost most\r\nof the minute events of early Aztec history. We have remained ignorant\r\nof much of the internal policy of the realm, and have been obliged to\r\nplay the antiquarian in the discussion of dates and epochs, whose\r\nperfect solution, even, would not cast a solitary ray of light upon\r\nthe grand problem of this continent's development or population. But\r\namid all this obscurity, ignorance, and diffuseness, we have the\r\nsatisfaction to know that some valuable facts escaped the grasp of\r\nthese destroyers, and that the grand historical traditions of the\r\nempire were eagerly listened to and recorded by some of the most\r\nenlightened Europeans who hastened after the conquest to New Spain.\r\nThe song, the story, and the anecdote, handed down from sire to son in\r\na nation which possessed no books, no system of writing, no letters,\r\nno alphabet,--formed in reality the great chain connecting age with\r\nage, king with king, family with family;--and, as the gigantic bond\r\nlengthened with time, some of its links were adorned with the\r\nembellishments of fancy, whilst others, in the dim and distant past,\r\nbecame almost imperceptible. Nor were the conquerors and their\r\nsuccessors men devoted to the antiquities of the Mexicans with the\r\ngenerous love of enthusiasts who delight in disclosing the means by\r\nwhich a people emerged from the obscurity of a tribe into the grandeur\r\nof a civilized nation. In most cases the only object they had in\r\nmagnifying, or even in manifesting the real character, genius and\r\nworks of the Mexicans, is to be found in their desire to satisfy their\r\ncountry and the world that they had indeed conquered an empire, and\r\nnot waged exterminating war against naked but wealthy savages. It was,\r\nin fact, a species of self laudation; and it has, therefore, not been\r\nwithout at least a slight degree of incredulity that we read the\r\nglowing early accounts of the palaces, the state and the power of the\r\nMexican emperors. The graphic works of Mr. Stephens on Yucatan and\r\nCentral America, seem, however, to open new authorities upon this vast\r\nproblem of civilization. Architecture never lies. It is one of those\r\nmassive records which require too much labor in order to record a\r\nfalsehood. The men who could build the edifices of Uxmal, Palenque,\r\nCopan and Chichen-Itza, were far removed from the aboriginal condition\r\nof Nomadic tribes. Taste and luxury had been long grafted on the mere\r\n_wants_ of the natives. They had learned not only to build for\r\nprotection against weather, but for permanent homes whose internal\r\narrangements should afford them comfort, and whose external appearance\r\nshould gratify the public taste. Order, symmetry, elegance, beauty of\r\nornament, gracefulness of symbolic imagery, had all combined to\r\nexhibit the external manifestations which are always seen among people\r\nwho are not only anxious to gratify others as well as themselves, but\r\nto vie with each other in the exhibition of individual tastes. Here,\r\nhowever, as in Egypt, the architectural remains are chiefly of\r\ntemples, tombs and palaces. The worship of God,--the safety of the\r\nbody after death,--and the permanent idea of loyal obedience to\r\nauthority,--are symbolized by the temple,--tomb,--and the rock-built\r\npalace. The masses, who felt they had no constant abiding place on\r\nearth, did not in all probability, build for themselves those\r\nsubstantial and beautifully embellished _homes_, under whose influence\r\nmodern civilization has so far exceeded the barren _humanism_ of the\r\nvalley of the Nile. It was useless, they deemed, to enshrine in marble\r\nwhilst living, the miserable spirit that, after death, might crawl in\r\na crocodile or burrow in a hog. Christianity, alone, has made the\r\n_Dwelling_ paramount to the Tomb and the Palace.\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave the early history of Spanish occupation without\r\nnaturally casting our eyes over the empire which it was the destiny of\r\nCortéz to conquer. Of its geographical boundaries we know but little.\r\nThe dominions of the original Aztecs covered but a small part of the\r\nterritory comprehended in modern Mexico; and although they were enlarged\r\nduring the empire, they did not even then extend beyond the eighteenth\r\ndegree and the twenty-first on the Atlantic or Gulf, and beyond the\r\nfourteenth and nineteenth degree including a narrow slip on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe seat and centre of the Mexican empire was in the valley of Mexico,\r\nin a temperate climate, whose genial mildness is gained by its\r\nelevation of over seven thousand feet above the level of the sea. The\r\nfeatures of this region,--the same now as at the conquest,--will be\r\nmore fully described hereafter in those chapters which treat of the\r\ngeography and statistics of modern Mexico.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern or western borders of the lake of Tezcoco, facing each\r\nother, stood the ancient cities of Tenochtitlan or Mexico, and of\r\nTezcoco. These were the capitals of the two most famous, flourishing\r\nand civilized states of Anahuac, the sources of whose population and\r\nprogress are veiled in the general mystery that overhangs the early\r\nhistory of our continent.\r\n\r\nThe general, and best received tradition that we possess upon the\r\nsubject, declares that the original inhabitants of this beautiful\r\nvalley came from the north; and that perhaps the earliest as well as\r\nthe most conspicuous in the legends, were the Toltecs, who moved to\r\nthe south before the end of the seventh century, and settled at Tollan\r\nor Tula, north of the Mexican valley, where extensive architectural\r\nremains were yet to be found at the period of the conquest. This spot\r\nseems to have gradually become the parent hive of civilization and\r\nadvancement; but, after four centuries, during which they extended\r\ntheir sway over the whole of Anahuac, the Toltecs are alleged to have\r\nwasted away by famine, disease, and the slow desolation of\r\nunsuccessful wars. This occurred about the year 1051, as the Indian\r\ntradition relates,--and the few who escaped the ravages of death,\r\ndeparted for those more southern regions now known as Yucatan and\r\nGuatemala, in which we perhaps find the present remains of their\r\ncivilization displayed in the temples, edifices and tombs of Palenque\r\nand Uxmal. During the next century these valleys and mountains were\r\nnearly desolate and bare of population, until a rude and altogether\r\nuncivilized tribe, known as the Chichimecas, came from Amaquemecan, in\r\nthe north, and settled in villages among the ruins of their Toltec\r\npredecessors. After eight years, six other Indian tribes called\r\nNahuatlacs arrived, and announced the approach of another band from\r\nthe north, known as the Aztecs, who, soon afterwards, entered Anahuac.\r\nAbout this period the Acolhuans, who are said to have emigrated from\r\nTeoacolhucan, near the original territories of the Chichimecas,\r\nadvanced into the valley and speedily allied themselves with their\r\nancient neighbors. These tribes appear to have been the founders of\r\nthe Tezcocan government and nation which was once assailed\r\nsuccessfully by the Tepanecs, but was finally delivered from thraldom\r\nby the signal bravery and talents of the prince Nezahualcoyotl, who\r\nwas heir of the crown, supported by his Mexican allies.\r\n\r\nOur chief concern, however, in groping our way through the tangled\r\nlabyrinth of tradition, is to ascertain the story of the AZTECS, whose\r\nadvent has been already announced. It was about the year 1160, that\r\nthey departed from Aztlan, the original seat of their tribe, on their\r\njourney of southern emigration. Their pilgrimage seems to have been\r\ninterrupted by numerous halts and delays, both on their route through\r\nthe northern regions now comprehended in the modern Republic of\r\nMexico, as well as in different parts of the Mexican valley which was\r\nsubsequently to become their home and capital. At length, in 1325,\r\nthey descried an eagle resting on a cactus which sprang from the\r\ncrevice of a rock in the lake of Tezcoco, and grasping in his talons a\r\nwrithing serpent. This had been designated by the Aztec oracles as the\r\nsite of the home in which the tribe should rest after its long and\r\nweary migration; and, accordingly, the city of Tenochtitlan, was\r\nfounded upon the sacred spot, and like another Venice rose from the\r\nbosom of the placid waters.\r\n\r\nIt was near a hundred years after the founding of the city, and in the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century, that the Tepanecs attacked the\r\nTezcocan monarchy, as has been related in the previous part of this\r\nchapter. The Tezcocans and the Aztecs or Mexicans united to put down\r\nthe power of the spoiler, and as a recompense for the important\r\nservices of the allies, the supreme dominion of the territory of the\r\nroyal house of Tezcoco was transferred to the Aztecs. The Tezcocan\r\nsovereigns thus became, in a measure, mediatized princes of the\r\nMexican throne; and the two states, together with the neighboring\r\nsmall kingdom of Tlacopan, south of the lake of Chalco, formed an\r\noffensive and defensive league which was sustained with unwavering\r\nfidelity through all the wars and assaults which ensued during the\r\nsucceeding century. The bold leaguers united in that spirit of plunder\r\nand conquest which characterizes a martial people, as soon as they are\r\nsurrounded by the necessaries, comforts, and elegances of life in\r\ntheir own country, and whenever the increase of population begins to\r\nrequire a vent through which it may expand those energies that would\r\ndestroy the state by rebellions or civil war, if pent up within the\r\nnarrow limits of so small a realm as the valley of Mexico. Accordingly\r\nwe find that the sway of this small tribe, which had but just nestled\r\namong the reeds, rocks and marshes of the lake, was quickly spread\r\nbeyond the mountain barrier that hemmed in the valley. Like the\r\nHollanders, they became great by the very wretchedness of their site,\r\nand the vigilant industry it enforced. The Aztec arms were triumphant\r\nthroughout all the plains that swept downward towards the Atlantic,\r\nand, as we have seen, even maintained dominion on the shores of the\r\nPacific, or penetrated, under the bloody Ahuitzotl, the remotest\r\ncorners of Guatemala and Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nSuch was the extent of Aztec power at the beginning of the 16th\r\ncentury, at the period of the Spanish incursion.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The discrepancies in the dates assigned by several writers\r\n    as to the periods of the emigration of various tribes and the\r\n    reigns of their sovereigns, are carefully presented in the\r\n    following table, given by Albert Gallatin, in his essay on the\r\n    Mexican nations--1 vol.

and the great discrepancy between the dates assigned by\r\n    various authorities, exhibits the guess work upon which the\r\n    earlier Mexican history is founded.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the tribes or States enumerated in the preceding\r\n    tables as constituting the nucleus of the Mexican empire under\r\n    Montezuma, at the period of the Spanish conquest, it must be\r\n    recollected that there were numerous other Indian States,--such as\r\n    the Tlascalans, Cholulans, &c., whose origin is more obscure even\r\n    than that of the Aztecs. Besides these, there were, on the\r\n    territories now comprehended within the Mexican republic, the\r\n    Tarascos who inhabited Michoacan, an independent sovereignty;--the\r\n    barbarous Ottomies; the Olmecs; the Xicalancas; the Miztecas, and\r\n    Zapotecas. The last named are supposed by Baron Humboldt to have\r\n    been superior, in civilization, to the Mexicans, and probably\r\n    preceded the Toltecs in the date of their emigration. Their\r\n    architectural remains are found in Oaxaca. If we consider the\r\n    comparatively small space in which the original tribes were\r\n    gathered together in the valley of Mexico, which is not probably\r\n    over two hundred and fifty miles in circumference, we cannot but\r\n    be surprised that such remarkable results were achieved from such\r\n    paltry beginnings and upon so narrow a theatre. The subjugation of\r\n    so large a territory and such numerous tribes, by the Aztecs and\r\n    Tezcocans is perhaps quite as wonderful an achievement, as the\r\n    final subjugation of those victorious nations by the Spaniards.\r\n    But in all our estimates of Spanish valor and generalship, in the\r\n    splendid campaigns of Cortéz, we should never forget,--as we have\r\n    remarked in the text,--the material assistance he received from\r\n    his Indian allies--the Tlascalans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: 1 vol.

In studying this subject carefully, even in the\r\nclassical pages of Mr. Prescott, and in the laborious criticisms of\r\nMr. Gallatin, we find ourselves frequently bewildered in the labyrinth\r\nof historical details and picturesque legends, which have been\r\ncarefully gathered and grouped to form a romantic picture of the Aztec\r\nnation. Yet facts enough have survived, not only the wreck of the\r\nconquest, but also the comparative stagnation of the viceroyalty, to\r\nsatisfy us that there was a large class of people, at least in the\r\ncapitals and their vicinity, whose tastes, habits, and social\r\nprinciples, were nearly equal to the civilization of the Old World at\r\nthat time. There were strange inconsistences in the principles and\r\nconduct of the Mexicans, and strange blendings of softness and\r\nbrutality, for the savage was as yet but rudely grafted on the citizen\r\nand the wandering or predatory habits of a tribe were scarcely tamed\r\nby the needful restraints of municipal law.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Aztec refinement existed chiefly in the city\r\nof Tenochtitlan or Mexico; or, that the capital of the empire, like\r\nthe capital of France, absorbed the greater share of the genius and\r\ncultivation of the whole country. Our knowledge of Yucatan, and of the\r\nwonderful cities which have been revealed in its forests by the\r\nindustry of Mr. Stephens, is altogether too limited to allow any\r\nconjectures, at this period, in regard to their inhabitants. It is\r\nlikely that they were offshoots from the same race as the Aztecs, and\r\nthat they all owed the first germs of their separate civilizations to\r\nthe Toltecs, who, according to the legends, were the great\r\ntraditionary ancestors of all the _progressive_ races that succeeded\r\neach other in emigrating from the north, and finally nestled in the\r\nlovely vale of Anahuac.\r\n\r\nIt is in the examination of such a period that we feel sensibly the\r\nwant of careful contemporary history, and learn to value those\r\nnarratives which present us the living picture of an age, even though\r\nthey are sometimes tainted with the intolerance of religious\r\nsectarianism and bigotry, or by the merciless rancor of party malice.\r\nThey give us, at least, certain material facts, which are independent\r\nof the spirit or context of the story. Posterity, which is now eager\r\nfor details, infinitely prefers a sketch like this, warm and breathing\r\nwith the vitality of the beings in whose presence and from whose\r\npersons it is drawn, to the cold mosaics, made up by skilful artizans,\r\nfrom the disjointed chips which they are forced to discover,\r\nharmonize, and polish, amid the discordant materials left by a hundred\r\nwriters. Such labors, when undertaken by patient men, may sometimes\r\nreanimate the past and bring back its scenes, systems and people, with\r\nwonderful freshness; yet, after all, they are but mere restorations,\r\nand often depend essentially on the vivid imagination which supplies\r\nthe missing fragments and fills them, for a moment, with an electrical\r\ninstead of a natural life.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful review of nearly all the historians and writers upon\r\nthe ancient history of Mexico, we have never encountered a\r\nsatisfactory view of the Aztec empire, except in the history of the\r\nconquest, by our countryman Prescott. His chapters upon the Mexican\r\ncivilization, are the best specimens in our literature, since the days\r\nof Gibbon, of that laborious, truthful, antiquarian temper, which\r\nshould always characterize a historian who ventures upon the difficult\r\ntask of portraying the distant past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our rapid sketch of the conquest, we have been compelled to\r\npresent, occasionally, a few descriptive glimpses of the Aztec\r\narchitecture, manners, customs and institutions, which have already\r\nacquainted the reader with some of the leading features of national\r\ncharacter. But it will not be improper, in a work like this, to\r\ncombine in a separate chapter such views of the whole structure of\r\nMexican society, under the original empire, as may not only afford an\r\nidea of the advancement of the nation which Cortéz conquered, but,\r\nperhaps, will present the student with some national characteristics\r\nof a race that still inhabits Mexico jointly with the Spanish\r\nemigrants, and which is the lawful descendant of the wandering tribes\r\nwho founded the city of Tenochtitlan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Aztec government was a monarchy, but the right to the throne did\r\nnot fall by the accident of descent upon a lineal relative of the last\r\nking, whose age would have entitled him, by European rule, to the\r\nroyal succession. The brothers of the deceased prince, or his nephews,\r\nif he had no nearer kin, were the individuals from whom the new\r\nsovereign was chosen by four nobles who had been selected as electors\r\nby their own aristocratic body during the preceding reign. These\r\nelectors, together with the two royal allies of Tezcoco and Tlacopan,\r\nwho were united in the college as merely honorary personages, decided\r\nthe question as to the candidate, whose warlike and intellectual\r\nqualities were always closely scanned by these severe judges.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the new monarch to the throne was pompous: yet,\r\nrepublican and just as was the rite of _selection_, the ceremony of\r\n_coronation_ was not performed until the new king had procured, by\r\nconquest in war, a crowd of victims to grace his assumption of the\r\ncrown with their sacrifice at the altar. The palaces of these princes\r\nand their nobles were of the most sumptuous character, according to\r\nthe description that has been left us by the conquerors themselves.\r\n\r\nThe royal state and style of these people may be best described in the\r\nartless language of Bernal Diaz del Castillo, a soldier of the\r\nconquest, whose simple narrative, though sometimes colored with the\r\nsuperstitions of his age, is one of the most valuable and veritable\r\nrelics of that great event that has been handed down to posterity.\r\n\r\nIn describing the entrance of the Spaniards into the city--Diaz\r\ndeclares, with characteristic energy, that the whole of what he saw on\r\nthat occasion appeared to him as if he had beheld it but\r\nyesterday;--and he fervently exclaims: \"Glory be to our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, who gave us courage to venture on such dangers and brought us\r\nsafely through them!\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, as we have already said in a preceding chapter, were\r\nlodged and entertained at the expense of Montezuma, who welcomed them\r\nas his guests, and unwisely attempted to convince them of his power by\r\nexhibiting his wealth and state. Two hundred of his nobility stood as\r\nguards in his ante-chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Of these,\" says Diaz, \"only certain persons could speak to him, and\r\nwhen they entered, they took off their rich mantles and put on others\r\nof less ornament, but clean. They approached his apartment barefooted,\r\ntheir eyes fixed on the ground and making three inclinations of the\r\nbody as they approached him. In addressing the king they said,\r\n\"Lord--my lord--great lord!\" When they had finished, he dismissed them\r\nwith a few words, and they retired with their faces toward him and\r\ntheir eyes fixed on the ground. I also observed, that when great men\r\ncame from a distance about business, they entered his palace\r\nbarefooted, and in plain habit; and also, that they did not come in by\r\nthe gate directly, but took a circuit in going toward it.\r\n\r\n\"His cooks had upward of thirty different ways of dressing meats, and\r\nthey had earthen vessels so contrived as to keep them constantly hot.\r\nFor the table of Montezuma himself, above three hundred dishes were\r\ndressed, and for his guards above a thousand. Before dinner, Montezuma\r\nwould sometimes go out and inspect the preparations, and his officers\r\nwould point out to him which were the best, and explain of what birds\r\nand flesh they were composed; and of those he would eat. But this was\r\nmore for amusement than anything else.\r\n\r\n\"It is said, that at times the flesh of young children was dressed for\r\nhim; but the ordinary meats were domestic fowls, pheasants, geese,\r\npartridges, quails, venison, Indian hogs, pigeons, hares and rabbits,\r\nwith many other animals and birds peculiar to the country. This is\r\ncertain--that after Cortéz had spoken to him relative to the dressing\r\nof human flesh, it was not practised in his palace. At his meals, in\r\nthe cold weather, a number of torches of the bark of a wood which\r\nmakes no smoke, and has an aromatic smell, were lighted; and, that\r\nthey should not throw too much heat, screens, ornamented with gold and\r\npainted with figures of idols, were placed before them.\r\n\r\n\"Montezuma was seated on a low throne or chair, at a table\r\nproportioned to the height of his seat. The table was covered with\r\nwhite cloths and napkins, and four beautiful women presented him with\r\nwater for his hands, in vessels which they call xicales, with other\r\nvessels under them, like plates, to catch the water. They also\r\npresented him with towels.\r\n\r\n\"Then two other women brought small cakes of bread, and, when the king\r\nbegan to eat, a large screen of gilded wood was placed before him, so\r\nthat during that period people should not behold him. The women having\r\nretired to a little distance, four ancient lords stood by the throne,\r\nto whom Montezuma, from time to time, spoke or addressed questions,\r\nand as a mark of particular favor, gave to each of them a plate of\r\nthat which he was eating. I was told that these old lords, who were\r\nhis near relations, were also counsellors and judges. The plates which\r\nMontezuma presented to them they received with high respect, eating\r\nwhat was on them without taking their eyes off the ground. He was\r\nserved in earthenware of Cholula, red and black. While the king was at\r\nthe table, no one of his guards in the vicinity of his apartment\r\ndared, for their lives, make any noise. Fruit of all kinds produced in\r\nthe country, was laid before him; he ate very little; but, from time\r\nto time, a liquor prepared from cocoa, and of a stimulative quality,\r\nas we were told, was presented to him in golden cups. We could not, at\r\nthat time, see whether he drank it or not; but I observed a number of\r\njars, above fifty, brought in, filled with foaming chocolate, of which\r\nhe took some that the women presented him.\r\n\r\n\"At different intervals during the time of dinner, there entered\r\ncertain Indians, humpbacked, very deformed, and ugly, who played\r\ntricks of buffoonery; and others who, they said, were jesters. There\r\nwas also a company of singers and dancers, who afforded Montezuma much\r\nentertainment. To these he ordered the vases of chocolate to be\r\ndistributed. The four female attendants then took away the cloths, and\r\nagain, with much respect, presented him with water to wash his hands,\r\nduring which time Montezuma conferred with the four old noblemen\r\nformerly mentioned, after which they took their leave with many\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\n\"One thing I forgot (and no wonder,) to mention in its place, and that\r\nis, during the time that Montezuma was at dinner, two very beautiful\r\nwomen were busily employed making small cakes,[13] with eggs and other\r\nthings mixed therein. These were delicately white, and, when made,\r\nthey presented them to him on plates covered with napkins. Also\r\nanother kind of bread was brought to him in long leaves, and plates of\r\ncakes resembling wafers.\r\n\r\n\"After he had dined, they presented to him three little canes, highly\r\nornamented, containing liquid-amber, mixed with an herb they call\r\ntobacco; and when he had sufficiently viewed and heard the singers,\r\ndancers, and buffoons, he took a little of the smoke of one of these\r\ncanes, and then laid himself down to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"The meal of the monarch ended, all his guards and domestics sat down\r\nto dinner; and, as near as I could judge, above a thousand plates of\r\nthose eatables that I have mentioned, were laid before them, with\r\nvessels of foaming chocolate and fruit in immense quantity. For his\r\nwomen, and various inferior servants, his establishment was of a\r\nprodigious expense; and we were astonished, amid such a profusion, at\r\nthe vast regularity that prevailed.\r\n\r\n\"His major domo kept the accounts of Montezuma's rents in books which\r\noccupied an entire house.\r\n\r\n\"Montezuma had two buildings filled with every kind of arms, richly\r\nornamented with gold and jewels; such as shields, large and small\r\nclubs like two-handed swords, and lances much larger than ours, with\r\nblades six feet in length, so strong that if they fix in a shield they\r\ndo not break; and sharp enough to use as razors.\r\n\r\n\"There was also an immense quantity of bows and arrows, and darts,\r\ntogether with slings, and shields which roll up into a small compass\r\nand in action are let fall, and thereby cover the whole body. He had\r\nalso much defensive armor of quilted cotton, ornamented with feathers\r\nin different devices, and casques for the head, made of wood and bone,\r\nwith plumes of feathers, and many other articles too tedious to\r\nmention.\"[14]\r\n\r\nBesides this sumptuous residence in the city, the Emperor is supposed\r\nto have had others at Chapultepec, Tezcoco and elsewhere, which will\r\nbe spoken of when we describe the ancient remains of Mexico in the\r\nvalley of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIf the sovereign lived, thus, in state befitting the ruler of such an\r\nempire, it may be supposed that his courtiers were not less sumptuous\r\nin their style of domestic arrangements. The great body of the nobles\r\nand caciques, possessed extensive estates, the tenures of which were\r\nchiefly of a military character;--and, upon these large possessions,\r\nsurrounded by warlike natives and numerous slaves, they lived,\r\ndoubtless, like many of the independent, powerful chieftains in\r\nEurope, who, in the middle ages, maintained their feudal splendor,\r\nboth in private life and in active service whenever summoned by their\r\nsovereigns to give aid in war.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Emperor over the laws of the country as well as over\r\nthe lives of the people, was perfectly despotic. There were supreme\r\njudges in the chief towns, appointed by the Emperor who possessed\r\nfinal jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes; and there were,\r\nbesides, minor courts in each province, as well as subordinate\r\nofficers, who performed the duty of police officers or spies over the\r\nfamilies that were assigned to their vigilance. Records were kept in\r\nthese courts of the decisions of the judges; and the laws of the realm\r\nwere likewise perpetuated and made certain, in the same hieroglyphic\r\nor picture writing. \"The great crimes against society,\" says Prescott,\r\n\"were all made capital;--even the murder of a slave was punished with\r\ndeath. Adulterers, as among the Jews, were stoned to death. Thieving,\r\naccording to the degree of the offence, was punished with slavery or\r\ndeath. It was a capital offence to remove the boundaries of another's\r\nlands; to alter the established measures; and for a guardian not to be\r\nable to give a good account of his ward's property. Prodigals who\r\nsquandered their patrimony were punished in like manner. Intemperance\r\nwas visited with the severest penalties, as if they had foreseen in it\r\nthe consuming canker of their own as well as of the other Indian races\r\nin later times. It was punished in the young with death, and in older\r\npersons with loss of rank and confiscation of property.\r\n\r\n\"The rites of marriage were celebrated with as much formality as in\r\nany Christian country; and the institution was held in such reverence,\r\nthat a tribunal was established for the sole purpose of determining\r\nquestions in regard to it. Divorces could not be obtained, until\r\nauthorized by a sentence of this court after a patient hearing of the\r\nparties.\"[15]\r\n\r\nSlavery seems to have always prevailed in Mexico. The captives taken\r\nin war were devoted to the gods under the sacrificial knife; but\r\ncriminals, public debtors, extreme paupers, persons who willingly\r\nresigned their freedom, and children who were sold by their\r\nparents,--were allowed to be held in bondage and to be transferred\r\nfrom hand to hand, but only in cases in which their masters were\r\ncompelled by poverty to part with them.\r\n\r\nA nation over which the god of war presided and whose king was\r\nselected, mainly, for his abilities as a chieftain, naturally guarded\r\nand surrounded itself with a well devised military system. Religion\r\nand war were blended in the imperial ritual. Montezuma, himself had\r\nbeen a priest before he ascended the throne. This dogma of the Aztec\r\npolicy, originated, perhaps, in the necessity of keeping up a constant\r\nmilitary spirit among a people whose instincts were probably\r\ncivilized, but whose geographical position exposed them, in the\r\nbeginning, to the attacks of unquiet and annoying tribes. The captives\r\nwere sacrificed to the bloody deity in all likelihood, because it was\r\nnecessary to free the country from dangerous Indians, who could\r\nneither be imprisoned, for they were too numerous, nor allowed to\r\nreturn to their tribes, because they would speedily renew the attack\r\non their Aztec liberators.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find that the Mexican armies were properly officered,\r\ndivided, supported and garrisoned, throughout the empire;--that there\r\nwere military orders of merit;--that the dresses of the leaders, and\r\neven of some of the regiments, were gaudily picturesque;--that their\r\narms were excellent;--and that the soldier who died in combat, was\r\nconsidered by his superstitious countrymen, as passing at once to \"the\r\nregion of ineffable bliss in the bright mansions of the sun.\" Nor were\r\nthese military establishments left to the caprice of petty officers for\r\ntheir judicial system. They possessed a set of recorded laws which were\r\nas sure and severe as the civil or criminal code of the empire;--and,\r\nfinally, when the Aztec soldier became too old to fight, or was disabled\r\nin the national wars, he was provided for in admirable hospitals which\r\nwere established in all the principal cities of the realm.\r\n\r\nBut all this expensive machinery of state and royalty, was not\r\nsupported without ample revenues from the people. There was a currency\r\nof different values regulated by trade, which consisted of quills\r\nfilled with gold dust; of pieces of tin cut in the form of a T; of\r\nballs of cotton, and bags of cacao containing a specified number of\r\ngrains. The greater part of Aztec trade was, nevertheless, carried on\r\nby barter; and, thus, we find that the large taxes which were derived\r\nby Montezuma from the crown lands, agriculture, manufactures, and the\r\nlabors or occupations of the people generally, were paid in \"cotton\r\ndresses and mantles of feather-work; ornamented armor; vases of gold;\r\ngold dust, bands and bracelets; crystal, gilt and varnished jars and\r\ngoblets; bells, arms and utensils of copper; reams of paper; grain;\r\nfruits, copal, amber, cochineal, cacao, wild animals, birds, timber,\r\nlime, mats,\" and a general medley in which the luxuries and\r\nnecessaries of life were strangely mixed. It is not a little singular\r\nthat silver, which since the conquest has become the leading staple\r\nexport of Mexico, is not mentioned in the royal inventories which\r\nescaped destruction.[16]\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Mythology was a barbarous compound of spiritualism and\r\nidolatry. The Aztecs believed in and relied on a supreme God whom they\r\ncalled Teotl, \"God,\" or Ipalnemoani--\"he by whom we live,\" and Tloque\r\nNahuaque,--\"he who has all in himself;\" while their counter-spirit or\r\ndemon, who was ever the enemy and seducer of their race bore the\r\ninauspicious title of Tlaleatecolototl, or the \"Rational Owl.\" The\r\ndark, nocturnal deeds of this ominous bird, probably indicated its\r\ngreater fitness for the typification of wickedness than of wisdom, of\r\nwhich the Greeks had flatteringly made it the symbol, as the pet of\r\nMinerva. These supreme spiritual essences were surrounded by a\r\nnumerous court of satellites or lesser deities, who were perhaps the\r\nministerial agents by which the behests of Teotl were performed. There\r\nwas Huitzilopotchtli, the god of war, and Teoyaomiqui, his spouse,\r\nwhose tender duties were confined to conducting the souls of warriors\r\nwho perished in defence of their homes and shrines, into the \"house of\r\nthe sun,\" which was the Aztec heaven. The image in the plate,\r\npresented in front and in profile, is alleged to represent this\r\ngraceful female, though it gives no idea of her holy offices.\r\nTetzcatlipoca was the shining mirror, the god of providence, the soul\r\nof the world, creator of heaven and earth, and master of all things.\r\nOmetcuctli and Omecihuatl, a god and goddess presided over new born\r\nchildren, and, reigning in Paradise, benignantly granted the wishes of\r\nmortals. Cihuacohuatl, or, woman-serpent, was regarded as the mother\r\nof human beings. Tonatricli and Meztli were deifications of the sun\r\nand moon. Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc were deities of the air and of\r\nwater, whilst Xiuhteuctli was the god of fire to whom the first morsel\r\nand the first draught at table were always devoted by the Aztecs.\r\nMictlanteuctli and Joalteuctli were the gods of hell and night, while\r\nthe generous goddess of the earth and grain who was worshipped by the\r\nTotonacos as an Indian Ceres, enjoyed the more euphonious title of\r\nCenteotl. Huitzilopotchtli or Mexitli, the god of war, was an especial\r\nfavorite with the Aztecs, for it was this divinity according to their\r\nlegends who had led them from the north, and protected them during\r\ntheir long journey until they settled in the valley of Mexico. Nor did\r\nhe desert them during the rise and progress of their nation. Addicted\r\nas they were to war, this deity was always invoked before battle and\r\nwas recompensed for the victories he bestowed upon his favorite people\r\nby bloody hecatombs of captives taken from the enemies of the empire.\r\nWe have already spoken of this personage in the portion of this work\r\nwhich treats of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the Mexicans had their gods, so also had they their final abodes of\r\nblessedness and misery. Soldiers who were slain in conflict for their\r\ncountry or who perished in captivity, and the spirits of women who\r\ndied in child-birth, went at once to the \"house of the sun\" to enjoy a\r\nlife of eternal pleasure. At dawn they hailed the rising orb with song\r\nand dances, and attended him to the meridian and his setting with\r\nmusic and festivity. The Aztecs believed that, after some years spent\r\namid these pleasures, the beatified spirits of the departed were\r\nchanged into clouds or birds of beautiful plumage, though they had\r\npower to ascend again whenever they pleased to the heaven they had\r\nleft. There was another place called Tlalocan the dwelling place of\r\nTlaloc, the deity of water, which was also an Aztec elysium. It was\r\nthe spirit-home of those who were drowned or struck by lightning,--of\r\nchildren sacrificed in honor of Tlaloc,--and of those who died of\r\ndropsy, tumors, or similar diseases. Last of all, was Mictlan, a\r\ngloomy hell of perfect darkness, in which, incessant night,\r\nunilluminated by the twinkling of a single ray, was the only\r\npunishment, and the probable type of annihilation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEOYAOMIQUI. (FRONT.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEOYAOMIQUI. (PROFILE.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe figure which is delineated in the plate representing Teoyaomiqui,\r\nis cut from a single block of basalt, and is nine feet high and five\r\nand a half broad. It is a horrid assemblage of hideous emblems. Claws,\r\nfangs, tusks, skulls and serpents, writhe and hang in garlands around\r\nthe shapeless mass. Four open hands rest, apparently without any\r\npurpose, upon the bared breasts of a female. In profile, it is not\r\nunlike a squatting toad, whose glistening eyes and broad mouth expand\r\nabove the cincture of skulls and serpents. Seen in this direction it\r\nappears to have more shape and meaning than in front. On the top of\r\nthe statue there is a hollow, which was probably used as the\r\nreceptacle of offerings or incense during sacrifice. The bottom of\r\nthis mass is also sculptured in relief, and as it will be observed in\r\nthe plate, that there are projections of the body near the waist, it\r\nis supposed that this frightful idol was suspended by them aloft on\r\npillars, so that its worshippers might pass beneath the massive stone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1790, this idol was found buried in the great square of Mexico,\r\nwhence it was removed to the court of the university; but as the\r\npriests feared that it might again tempt the Indians to their ancient\r\nworship, it was interred until the year 1821, since which time it has\r\nbeen exhibited to the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTTOM OF TEOYAOMIQUI.]\r\n\r\nThe reader who has accompanied us from the beginning of this volume\r\nand perused the history of the Spanish conquest, has doubtless become\r\nsomewhat familiar with the great square of ancient Tenochtitlan, its\r\n_Teocalli_, or pyramidal temple, and the bloody rites that were\r\ncelebrated upon it, by the Aztec priests and princes. It served as a\r\nplace of sacrifice, not only for the Indian victims of war, but\r\nstreamed with the blood of the unfortunate Spaniards who fell into the\r\npower of the Mexicans when Cortéz was driven from the city.\r\n\r\nThis _Teocalli_ is said to have been completed in the year 1486,\r\nduring the reign of the eighth sovereign of Tenochtitlan or Mexico,\r\nand occupied that portion of the present city upon which the cathedral\r\nstands and which is occupied by some of the adjacent streets and\r\nbuildings. Its massive proportions and great extent may be estimated\r\nfrom the restoration of this edifice, which we have attempted to form\r\nfrom the best authorities, and have presented in a plate in the\r\npreceding portion of this work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Mexican theology indulged in two kinds of sacrifice, one of which\r\nwas an ordinary offering of a common victim, while the other, or\r\ngladiatorial sacrifice, was only used for captives of extraordinary\r\ncourage and bravery.\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect the fact that the Aztec tribe was an intruder into\r\nthe valley of Anahuac, and that it laid the foundations of its capital\r\nin the midst of enemies, we are not surprised that so hardy a race,\r\nfrom the northern hive, was both warlike in its habits and sanguinary\r\nin its religion. With a beautiful land around it on all sides,--level,\r\nfruitful, but incapable of easy defence,--it was forced to quit the\r\nsolid earth and to build its stronghold in the waters of the lake. We\r\ncan conceive no other reason for the selection of such a site. The\r\neagle may have been seen on a rock amid the water devouring the\r\nserpent; but we do not believe that this emblem of the will of heaven,\r\nin guiding the wanderers to their refuge in the lake of Tezcoco, was\r\nknown to more than the leaders of the tribe until it became necessary\r\nto control the band by the interposition of a miracle. Something more\r\nwas needed than mere argument, to plant a capital in the water, and,\r\nthus, we doubt not, that the singular omen, in which the modern arms\r\nof Mexico have originated, was contrived or invented by the priests or\r\nchiefs of the unsettled Aztecs.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by enemies, with nothing that they could strictly call\r\ntheir own, save the frail retreat among the reeds and rushes of their\r\nmimic Venice, it undoubtedly became necessary for the Aztecs to keep\r\nno captives taken in war. Their gardens, like their town, were\r\nconstructed upon the _Chinampas_, or floating beds of earth and wicker\r\nwork, which were anchored in the lake. They could not venture, at any\r\ndistance from its margin, to cultivate the fields. When they sallied\r\nfrom their city, they usually left it for the battle field; and, when\r\nthey returned, it is probable that it seemed to them not only a\r\npropitiation of their gods, but a mercy to the victims, to sacrifice\r\ntheir numerous captives, who if retained in idleness as prisoners\r\nwould exact too large a body for their custody, or, if allowed to go\r\nat large, might rise against their victors, and, in either case, would\r\nsoon consume the slender stores they were enabled to raise by their\r\nscant horticulture. In examining the history of the Aztecs, and\r\nnoticing the mixture of civilization which adorned their public and\r\nprivate life, and the barbarism which characterized their merciless\r\nreligion, we have been convinced that the Aztec rite of sacrifice\r\noriginated, in the infancy of the state in a national necessity, and,\r\nat length, under the influence of superstition and policy, grew into\r\nan ordinance of faith and worship.\r\n\r\nThe COMMON SACRIFICE, offered in the Aztec temples was performed by a\r\nchief priest, and six assistants. The principal flamen, habited in a\r\nred scapulary fringed with cotton, and crowned with a circlet of green\r\nand yellow plumes, assumed, for the occasion, the name of the deity to\r\nwhom the offering was made. His acolytes,--clad in white robes\r\nembroidered with black; their hands covered with leathern thongs;\r\ntheir foreheads filleted with parti-colored papers; and their bodies\r\ndyed perfectly black,--prepared the victim for the altar, and having\r\ndressed him in the insignia of the deity to whom he was to be\r\nsacrificed, bore him through the town begging alms for the temple. He\r\nwas then carried to the summit of the _Teocalli_, where four priests\r\nextended him across the curving surface of an arched stone placed on\r\nthe sacrificial stone, while another held his head firmly beneath the\r\nyoke which is represented elsewhere. The chief priest,--the\r\n_topiltzin_ or sacrificer, then stretched the breast of the victim\r\ntightly by bending his body back as far as possible, and, seizing the\r\nobsidian knife of sacrifice, cut a deep gash across the region of the\r\ncaptive's heart. The extreme tension of the flesh and muscles, at once\r\nyielded beneath the blade, and the heart of the victim lay palpitating\r\nin the bloody gap. The sacrificer immediately thrust his hand into the\r\nwound, and, tearing out the quivering vital, threw it at the feet of\r\nthe idol,--inserted it with a golden spoon into its mouth,--or, after\r\noffering it to the deity, consumed it in fire and preserved the sacred\r\nashes with the greatest reverence. When these horrid rites were\r\nfinished in the temple, the victim's body was thrown from the top of\r\nthe _Teocalli_, whence it was borne to the dwelling of the individual\r\nwho offered the sacrifice, where it was eaten by himself and his\r\nfriends, or, was devoted to feed the beasts in the royal menagerie.\r\n\r\nNumerous cruel sacrifices were practised by the Indians of Mexico, and\r\nespecially among the Quauhtitlans, who, every four years, slew eight\r\nslaves or captives, in a manner almost too brutal for description.\r\nSometimes the Aztecs contented themselves with other and more\r\nsignificant oblations; and flowers, fruits, bread, meat, copal, gums,\r\nquails, and rabbits, were offered on the altars of their gods. The\r\npriests, no doubt, approved these gifts far more than the tough flesh\r\nof captives or slaves!\r\n\r\nThe GLADIATORIAL SACRIFICE was reserved, as we have already said for\r\nnoble and courageous captives. According to Clavigero, a circular\r\nmass, three feet high, resembling a mill stone, was placed within the\r\narea of the great temple upon a raised terrace about eight feet from\r\nthe wall. The captive was bound to this stone by one foot, and was\r\narmed with a sword or _maquahuitl_ and shield. In this position, and\r\nthus accoutred, he was attacked by a Mexican soldier or officer, who\r\nwas better prepared with weapons for the deadly encounter. If the\r\nprisoner was conquered he was immediately borne to the altar of common\r\nsacrifice. If he overcame six assailants he was rewarded with life and\r\nliberty, and permitted once more to return to his native land with the\r\nspoils that had been taken from him in war. Clavigero supposes that\r\nfor many years, twenty thousand victims were offered on the Mexican\r\nteocallis, in the \"common sacrifice;\" and in the consecration of the\r\ngreat temple, sixty thousand persons were slain in order to baptise\r\nthe pyramid with their blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACRIFICIAL STONE.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent idea of the sacrificial stone, will be obtained from the\r\nplates which are annexed. Neat and graceful ornaments, are raised in\r\nrelief on the surface, and in the centre is a deep bowl, whence a canal\r\nor gutter leads to the edge of the cylinder. It is a mass of basaltic\r\nrock nine feet in diameter and three in height, and was found in the\r\ngreat square in 1790, near the site of the large teocalli or pyramid. On\r\nits sides are repeated, all round the stone, the same two figures\r\nwhich are drawn in the second plate. They evidently represent a victor\r\nand a prisoner. The conqueror is in the act of tearing the plumes from\r\nthe crest of the vanquished, who bows beneath the blow and lowers his\r\nweapons. The similarity of these figures to some that are delineated in\r\nthe first volume of Stephens' Yucatan is remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE OF SACRIFICIAL STONE.]\r\n\r\nTHE AZTEC CALENDAR STONE, another monument of Mexican antiquity, was\r\nfound in December, 1790, buried under ground in the great square of\r\nthe capital. Like the idol image of Teoyaomiqui, and the sacrificial\r\nstone, it is carved from a mass of basalt, and is eleven feet eight\r\ninches in diameter, the depth of its circular edge being about seven\r\nand a half inches from the fractured square of rock out of which it\r\nwas originally cut. It is supposed, from the fact that it was found\r\nbeneath the pavement of the present _plaza_, that it was part of the\r\nfixtures of the great Teocalli of Tenochtitlan, or that it was placed\r\nin some of the adjoining edifices on palaces surrounding the temple.\r\nIt is now walled into the west side of the cathedral, and is a\r\nremarkable specimen of the talent of the Indians for sculpture, at the\r\nsame time that its huge mass, together with those of the sacrificial\r\nstone and the idol Teoyaomiqui, denote the skill of their inventors in\r\nthe movement of immense weights, without the aid of horses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs calculated their civil year by the solar; they divided it\r\ninto eighteen months of twenty days each, and added five complimentary\r\ndays, as in Egypt, to make up the complete number of three hundred and\r\nsixty-five. After the last of these months the five _nemontemi_ or\r\n\"useless days\" were intercalated, and, belonging to no particular\r\nmonth, were regarded as unlucky, by the superstitious natives. Their\r\nweek consisted of five days, the last of which was the market day; and\r\na month was composed of four of these weeks. As the tropical year is\r\ncomposed of about six hours more than three hundred and sixty-five\r\ndays, they lost a day every fourth year, which they supplied, not at\r\nthe termination of that period, but at the expiration of their cycle\r\nof fifty-two years, when they intercalated the twelve days and a half\r\nthat were lost. Thus it was found, at the period of the Spanish\r\nconquest, that their computation of time corresponded with the\r\nEuropean, as calculated by the most accurate astronomers.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Aztec or Toltec cycle of fifty-two years,--for it is\r\nnot accurately ascertained to which of the tribes the astronomical\r\nscience of Tenochtitlan is to be attributed,--these primitive\r\nchildren of the New World believed that the world was in danger of\r\ninstant destruction. Accordingly, its termination became one of their\r\nmost serious and awful epochs, and they anxiously awaited the moment\r\nwhen the sun would be blotted out from the heavens, and the globe\r\nitself once more resolved unto chaos. As the cycle ended in the\r\nwinter, the season of the year, with its drearier sky and colder air,\r\nin the lofty regions of the valley, added to the gloom that fell upon\r\nthe hearts of the people. On the last day of the fifty-two years, all\r\nthe fires in temples and dwellings were extinguished, and the natives\r\ndevoted themselves to fasting and prayer. They destroyed alike their\r\nvaluable and worthless wares; rent their garments; put out their\r\nlights, and hid themselves, for awhile in solitude. Pregnant women\r\nseem to have been the objects of their especial dread at this moment.\r\nThey covered their faces with masks and imprisoned them securely, for\r\nthey imagined, that on the occurrence of the grand and final\r\ncatastrophe, these beings, who, elsewhere, are always the objects of\r\npeculiar interest and tenderness, would be suddenly turned into beasts\r\nof prey and would join the descending legions of demons, to revenge\r\nthe injustice or cruelty of man.\r\n\r\nAt dark, on the last dread evening,--as soon as the sun had set, as\r\nthey imagined, forever,--a sad and solemn procession of priests and\r\npeople marched forth from the city to a neighboring hill, to rekindle\r\nthe \"New Fire.\" This mournful march was called the \"procession of the\r\ngods,\" and was supposed to be their final departure from their temples\r\nand altars.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the melancholy array reached the summit of the hill, it\r\nreposed in fearful anxiety until the Pleiades reached the zenith in\r\nthe sky, whereupon the priests immediately began the sacrifice of a\r\nhuman victim, whose breast was covered with a wooden shield, which the\r\nchief _flamen_ kindled by friction. When the sufferer received the\r\nfatal stab from the sacrificial knife of _obsidian_, the machine was\r\nset in motion on his bosom, until the blaze had kindled. The anxious\r\ncrowd stood round with fear and trembling. Silence reigned over nature\r\nand man. Not a word was uttered among the countless multitude that\r\nthronged the hill-sides and plains, whilst the priest performed his\r\ndireful duty to the gods. At length, as the first sparks gleamed\r\nfaintly from the whirling instrument, low sobs and ejaculations were\r\nwhispered among the eager masses. As the sparks kindled into a blaze,\r\nand the blaze into a flame, and the flaming shield and victim were\r\ncast together on a pile of combustibles which burst at once into the\r\nbrightness of a conflagration, the air was rent with the joyous\r\nshouts of the relieved and panic stricken Indians. Far and wide over\r\nthe dusky crowds beamed the blaze like a star of promise. Myriads of\r\nupturned faces greeted it from hills, mountains, temples, terraces,\r\nteocallis, house tops and city walls; and the prostrate multitudes\r\nhailed the emblem of light, life and fruition as a blessed omen of the\r\nrestored favor of their gods and the preservation of the race for\r\nanother cycle. At regular intervals, Indian couriers held aloft brands\r\nof resinous wood, by which they transmitted the \"New Fire\" from hand\r\nto hand, from village to village, and town to town, throughout the\r\nAztec empire. Light was radiated from the imperial or ecclesiastical\r\ncentre of the realm. In every temple and dwelling it was rekindled,\r\nfrom the sacred source; and when the sun rose again on the following\r\nmorning, the solemn procession of priests, princes and subjects, which\r\nhad taken up its march from the capital on the preceding night, with\r\nsolemn steps, returned once more to the abandoned capital, and\r\nrestoring the gods to their altars, abandoned themselves to joy and\r\nfestivity in token of gratitude and relief from impending doom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AZTEC CALENDAR STONE.]\r\n\r\nWe have thought it proper and interesting to preface the description\r\nof the calendar stone by the preceding account of the Aztec festival\r\nof the New Fire, which illustrates the mingled elements of science and\r\nsuperstition that so largely characterized the empire of Montezuma.\r\nThe stone itself has engaged the attention, for years, of numerous\r\nantiquarians in Mexico, Europe and America, but it has received from\r\nnone so perfect a description, as from the late Albert Gallatin, who\r\ndevoted a large portion of his declining years to the study of the\r\nancient Mexican chronology and languages. In the first volume of the\r\nTransactions of the American Ethnological Society he has contributed\r\nan admirable summary of his investigations of the semi-civilized\r\nnations of Mexico, Yucatan and Central America, and from this we shall\r\ncondense the portion which relates to this remarkable monument.\r\n\r\nAround the principal central figure, representing the sun, are\r\ndelineated in a circular form the twenty days of the month; which are\r\nmarked from 1 to 20, with figures in the plates, and, in this order,\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n   1 Cipactli.\r\n   2 Xochitl.\r\n   3 Quiahuitl.\r\n   4 Tecpatl.\r\n   5 Ollin.\r\n   6 Cozcaquauhitli.\r\n   7 Quauhtli.\r\n   8 Ocelotl.\r\n   9 Acatl.\r\n  10 Malinalli.\r\n  11 Ozomatli.\r\n  12 Itzeuinitli.\r\n  13 Atl.\r\n  14 Tochtli.\r\n  15 Mazatl.\r\n  16 Miquiztli.\r\n  17 Cohualt.\r\n  18 Cuetzpalni.\r\n  19 Calli.\r\n  20 Ehecatl.\r\n\r\nThe triangular figure I, above the circle enclosing the emblem of the\r\nsun, denotes the beginning of the year. Around the circumference which\r\nbounds the symbols of the days and months are found the places of\r\nfifty-two small squares, of which only forty are actually visible, the\r\nother twelve being covered by the four _principal_ rays of the sun\r\nmarked R. These doubtless denote the cycle of 52 years; and each of\r\nthese squares contains five small oblongs, making in all 260 for the\r\n52 squares. They are presumed to represent the 260 days or the period\r\nof the twenty first series of thirteen days. All the portion, included\r\nbetween the outer circumference of these 260 days and the external\r\nzone, has not been decyphered accurately. The external zone consists,\r\nexcept at the extremities, of a symbol twenty times repeated, and is\r\nalleged by Gama, a Mexican who first described and attempted to\r\ninterpret the stone, to represent the milky way. The waving lines\r\nconnected with it are supposed by this writer to represent clouds,\r\nwhile others imagine them to be the symbols of the mountains in which\r\nclouds and storms originated. These fanciful interpretations, however,\r\nare unavailable in all scientific descriptions, and Mr. Gallatin\r\nsupposes the figures to be altogether ornamental.\r\n\r\nThe whole circle is divided into eight equal parts by the eight\r\ntriangles R, which designate the rays of the sun. The intervals\r\nbetween these are each divided into two equal parts by the small\r\ncircles indicated by the letter L. At the top of the vertical ray is\r\nfound the hieroglyphic 13 Acatl, which shows that this stone applies\r\nto that year. It must be recollected that, although this Mexican\r\ncalendar is in its arrangement the same for every year in the cycle,\r\nthere was a variation at the rate of a day for every four years,\r\nbetween the several years of the cycle and the corresponding solar\r\nyears. Gama presumes that this date of 13 Acatl was selected on\r\naccount of its being the twenty-sixth year of the cycle and equally\r\nremoved from its beginning and termination. Beneath this hieroglyphic,\r\nin correct drawings of the stone--but not in that of Gama which has\r\nbeen reproduced by Mr. Gallatin--will be found, between the letters Y\r\nand G, the distinct sign of 2, Acatl, and the ray above it points to\r\nthe sign of the year 13 Acatl, which coincides with our 21st of\r\nDecember, and is undoubtedly the hitherto undetermined date of the\r\nwinter solstice in the Mexican calendar.[17]\r\n\r\nThe smaller interior circle, we have already said, contains the image\r\nof the sun, as usually painted by the Indians; and to it are united\r\nthe four parallelograms A, B, C, D, which are supposed by some writers\r\nto denote the four weeks into which the twenty days of the month were\r\ndivided, but which contain the hieroglyphics, A, of 4 Ocelotl; B, of 4\r\nEhecatl; C, of 4 Quiahuitl; and D, of 4 Atl. The lateral figures E and\r\nF, according to Gama denote claws, which are symbolical of two great\r\nIndian astrologers who were man and wife, and were represented as\r\neagles or owls.\r\n\r\nThe representations in these parallelograms, are believed to have\r\noriginated in the Mexican fable of the SUNS, which will be hereafter\r\nnoticed. The Aztecs believed that this luminary had died four times,\r\nand that the one which at present lights the earth, was the fifth, but\r\nwhich nevertheless was doomed to destruction like the preceding orbs.\r\nFrom the creation, the first age or sun, lasted 676 years, comprising\r\n13 cycles, when the crops failed, men perished of famine and their\r\nbodies were consumed by the beasts of the field. This occurred in the\r\nyear 1 Acatl, and on the day 4 Ocelotl, and the ruin lasted for\r\nthirteen years. The next age and sun endured 364 years or 7 cycles,\r\nand terminated in the year 1 Tecpatl on the day 4 Ehecatl, when\r\nhurricanes and rain desolated the globe and men were metamorphosed\r\ninto monkeys. The third age continued for 312 years, or 6 cycles, when\r\nfire or earthquakes rent the earth and human beings were converted\r\ninto owls in the year 1 Tecpatl, on the day 4 Quiahuitl;--while the\r\nfourth age or sun lasted but for a single cycle of 52 years, and the\r\nworld was destroyed by a flood, which either drowned the people or\r\nchanged them into fishes, in the year 1 Calli, on the day 4 Atl. The\r\nfour epochs of destruction are precisely the days typified by the\r\nhieroglyphics in the four parallelograms A, B, C and D.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by adding the several periods together that the Aztecs\r\ncounted 1469 years from the creation of the world to the flood; yet\r\nthere is an incongruity in this imaginary antediluvian history. If the\r\nfourth age had lasted only 52 years, it would have terminated in the\r\nyear 1 Tecpatl instead of 1 Calli. Bustamante, the publisher and\r\nannotator of Gama, states that some authorities contend for only three\r\nantecedent periods, and that the present age is expected to end by\r\nfire. But Mr. Gallatin alleges that the four ages and five suns have\r\nbeen generally adopted, and are sustained by the ancient Aztec\r\npaintings contained in the Codex Vaticanus, plates 7 to 10. Like most\r\nof the Mexican antiquities, this branch of the Chronology is admitted\r\nto be exceedingly obscure, for it is asserted in the Appendix to Mr.\r\nGallatin's essay that the hieroglyphics annexed to these _paintings_,\r\nmay be interpreted as giving to the four ages respectively the\r\nduration of either 682, 530, 576, and 582, or of 5206, 2010, 4404, and\r\n4008 years.\r\n\r\n\"This would appear to be purely mythological, but the fact that all\r\nthese imaginary antediluvian periods consist of a certain number of\r\ncycles, shows that this fable was invented subsequent to the time when\r\nthe Mexicans had attained a knowledge of cycles, years and of the\r\napproximate _length_ of the solar year. It seems, therefore, probable\r\nthat the mythological representation is in some way connected with\r\ncelestial phenomena, and it is accordingly, found that the days\r\ndesignated in the parallelograms A and C, as 4 Ocelotl, and 4\r\nQuiahuitl, correspond respectively, (on the assumption that the first\r\nyear of the cycle corresponds with the 31st of December,) with the\r\n13th of May and 17th of July, old style, or 22d of May and 26th of\r\nJuly, new style. And these two days 22d of May and 26th of July, are\r\nthose, according to Gama, of the transit of the sun by the zenith of\r\nthe city of Mexico, which, by the observations of Humboldt, lies in\r\n19° 25' and 57\" north latitude and in 101° 25' 20\" west longitude from\r\nParis. The two other days 4 Ehecatl, and 4 Atl, do not correspond\r\neither in the first year of the cycle or in the year 13 Acatl, with\r\nany station of the sun or any other celestial phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"There are three other hieroglyphics contained within the interior\r\ncircumference or representation of the sun, which indicate the dates\r\nof some celebrated feasts of the Aztecs. The three following\r\nindications or hieroglyphics are found immediately below the figure of\r\nthe sun. The first of these, designated by the letter H, is placed\r\nbetween the parallelograms C and D, and consists of two squares of\r\nfive oblongs each, indicating the Aztec numeral 10. The symbol of the\r\nday is not annexed, but the whole of the central figure is itself the\r\nsign Olin Tonatiah, and the hieroglyphic of the day Olin, as\r\ndelineated on the stone among the other emblems of the days, is on a\r\nsmall scale and abbreviated form of that central and principal figure\r\nof the stone. The day designated here, is consequently, 10 Olin. Below\r\nthis, and on each side respectively of the great vertical ray of the\r\nsun, are found the hieroglyphics of the days 1 Quiahuitl, and 2\r\nOzomatli. Of the last mentioned days,--10 Olin corresponds in the\r\nfirst year of the cycle, with the 22d day of September, new style;--1\r\nQuiahuitl with the 28th of March, and 2 Ozomatli with the 28th of\r\nJune, as will be seen by the table at the end of this description of\r\nthe calendar.\r\n\r\n\"We find, therefore, delineated on this stone all the dates of the\r\nprincipal positions of the sun, and it thus appears that the Aztecs\r\nhad ascertained with considerable precision the respective days of the\r\ntwo passages of the sun by the zenith of Mexico, of the two equinoxes,\r\nand of the summer and winter solstices. They had therefore six\r\ndifferent means of ascertaining and verifying the length of the solar\r\nyear by counting the number of days elapsed till the sun returned to\r\neach of these six points,--the two solstices, the two equinoxes, and\r\nthe two passages by the zenith.\"[18]\r\n\r\nMEXICAN ALMANAC,\r\n\r\nACCORDING TO GAMA.\r\n\r\n  Column Headings:\r\n    A: Names of the months.\r\n    B: Tititl.\r\n    C: Itzcalli.\r\n    D: Xilomanaliztli.\r\n    E: Tlacaxipehnaliztli.\r\n    F: Tozoztontli.\r\n    G: Hueytozoztli.\r\n    H: Toxcall.\r\n    I: Etzalqualiztli.\r\n    J: Tecuilhuitontli.\r\n    K: Heuytecuilhuitl.\r\n    L: Miccailhuitonili.\r\n    M: Heuymiccailhuitl.\r\n    N: Ochpaniztli.\r\n    O: Pachtli.\r\n    P: Heuypachtli.\r\n    Q: Quecholli.\r\n    R: Panquetzaliztli.\r\n    S: Atenioztli.\r\n    T: The five Nemontemi.\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n  ||                A              | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  | H  |\r\n  ||-------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n  ||             Months.           |1st | 2d | 3d |4th |5th |6th |7th |\r\n  ||                               |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  ||Day of the Julian year, N.

The\r\n    series of 13 days, designed by its proper numeral from 1 to 13.\r\n    And the series of the 9 night companions, designated in this Table\r\n    by the letters a, b, ... h, i, viz.:\r\n\r\n  a. {Xiuhteuctli.\r\n     {Tletl.\r\n  b.  Tecpatl.\r\n  c.  Xochitl.\r\n  d.  Cinteotl.\r\n  e.  Miquiztli.\r\n  f.  Atl.\r\n  g.  Tlazolteotl.\r\n  h.  Tepeyolotli.\r\n  i.  Quiahuitl.\r\n\r\n    Thus every day in the year is so distinguished that it can never\r\n    be confounded with any other. The day 4 Ollin is the 17th day of\r\n    both the first and the fourteenth month; but in the first instance\r\n    it is distinguished by the letter _h_, and in the second by the\r\n    letter _g_. If the characteristics of the 9th day of the 10th\r\n    month be required, the Table shows that it is 7 _Atl i_; and thus\r\n    also the 13th day of the 16th month (Quecholli) is shown to be 1\r\n    _Acatl g_, and the 313th of the year.\r\n\r\n    But it is only for the first year of the cycle (1 Tochtli) that the\r\n    Mexican year corresponds with ours in the manner stated in the\r\n    Table. For, on account of our intercalation of one day every\r\n    bissextile year, the Mexican year receded, as compared with ours,\r\n    one day every four years. This correction must therefore be made,\r\n    whenever a comparison of the dates is wanted for any other than the\r\n    first year of the cycle. The Mexican intercalation of 13 days at the\r\n    end of the cycle of 52 years made again the first year of every\r\n    cycle correspond with our year, in the manner stated in the Table.\r\n\r\n    Another correction is again necessary, when we have a Tescocan\r\n    instead of a Mexican date. For the first year of the Mexican cycle\r\n    was 1 Tochtli, and that of Tescoco was 1 Acatl; which caused a\r\n    difference now of three, now of ten days in their calendars, which\r\n    in every other respect were the same.

The allurements of gold\r\nand the enticements of a prolific soil, under delicious skies, had not\r\nyet ceased to inflame the ardent national fancy of Spain, so that an\r\neager immigration escaped by every route to America. An almost regal\r\nand absolute power was vested by special grants from the king in the\r\npersons who were despatched from his court to found the first\r\ngovernments in the New World. But this authority was so abused by some\r\nof the ministerial agents that Charles V. took an early occasion to\r\ncurb their power and diminish their original privileges. The Indians\r\nwho had been divided with the lands among the conquerors by the\r\nslavish system of _repartimientos_, were declared to be the king's\r\nsubjects. In 1537 the Pope issued a decree declaring the aborigines to\r\nbe \"really and truly men,\"--\"ipsos veros homines,\"--who were capable\r\nof receiving the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign was ever regarded from the first as the direct fountain\r\nof all authority throughout Spanish America. All his provinces were\r\ngoverned as colonies and his word was their supreme law. In 1511,\r\nFerdinand created a new governmental department for the control of his\r\nAmerican subjects, denominated the COUNCIL OF THE INDIES, but it was\r\nnot fully organized until the reign of Charles the Fifth in 1524. The\r\n_Recopilacion de las leyes de las Indias_ declared that this council\r\nshould have supreme jurisdiction over all the Western Indies\r\npertaining to the Spanish crown, which had been discovered, at that\r\nperiod, or which might thereafter be discovered;--that this\r\njurisdiction should extend over all their interests and affairs; and,\r\nmoreover, that the council, with the royal assent, should make all\r\nlaws and ordinances, necessary for the welfare of those provinces.[19]\r\nThis Council of the Indies consisted of a president, who was the king,\r\nfour secretaries, and twenty-two counsellors, and the members were\r\nusually chosen from among those who had either been viceroys or held\r\nhigh stations abroad. It appointed all the officers employed in\r\nAmerica in compliance with the nomination of the crown, and every one\r\nwas responsible to it for his conduct. As soon as this political and\r\nlegislative machine was created it began its scheme of law making for\r\nthe colonies, not, however, upon principles of national right, but\r\naccording to such dictates of expediency or profit as might accrue to\r\nthe Spaniards. From time to time they were apprised of the wants of\r\nthe colonists, but far separated as they were from the subject of\r\ntheir legislation, they naturally committed many errors in regard to a\r\npeople with whom they had not the sympathy of a common country, and\r\ncommon social or industrial interests. They legislated either for\r\nabstractions or with the selfish view of working the colonies for the\r\nadvantage of the Spanish crown rather than for the gradual and\r\nbeautiful development of American capabilities. The mines of this\r\ncontinent first attracted the attention of Spain, and the prevailing\r\nprinciple of the scheme adopted in regard to them, was, that the\r\nmother country should produce the necessaries or luxuries of life for\r\nher colonial vassals, whilst they recompensed their parent with a\r\nbountiful revenue of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe bungling, blind, and often corrupt legislation of the Council of\r\nthe Indies soon filled its records with masses of contradictory and\r\nuseless laws, so that although there were many beneficent acts,\r\ndesigned especially for the comfort of the Indians, the administration\r\nof so confused a system became almost incompatible with justice. If\r\nthe source of law was vicious its administration was not less impure.\r\nThe principal courts of justice were the AUDIENCIAS REALES, or Royal\r\nAudiences. In addition to the president,--who was the Viceroy, or\r\nCaptain General,--the _audiencia_ or court was composed of a regent,\r\nthree judges, two _fiscales_ or attorneys, (one for civil and the\r\nother for criminal cases) a reporter, and an _alguazil_, or constable.\r\nThe members of these courts were appointed by the king himself, and,\r\nbeing almost without exception, natives of old Spain, they possessed\r\nbut few sympathies for the colonists.\r\n\r\nAfter the Royal Audiences, came the CABILDOS whose members, consisting\r\nof _regidores_ and other persons appointed by the king, and of two\r\n_alcaldes_ annually elected by the _regidores_ from among the\r\npeople,--constituted a municipal body in almost every town or village of\r\nimportance. These _cabildos_ had no legislative jurisdiction, but\r\nsuperintended the execution of the laws within their districts and\r\nregulated all minor local matters. The office of _regidor_ was a regular\r\nmatter of bargain and sale; and, as the _regidores_ subsequently elected\r\nthe _alcaldes_, it will be seen that this admitted of great corruption,\r\nand tended to augment the direct oppression of the masses subjected to\r\ntheir jurisdiction. It was an instrument to increase the wealth and\r\nstrengthen the tyrannical power of the rulers.\r\n\r\nThese ill regulated _audiencias_ and _cabildos_, were, in themselves,\r\ncapable of destroying all principles of just harmony, and were\r\nsufficient to corrupt the laws both in their enactment and\r\nadministration. But all men were not equal before these tribunals. A\r\nsystem of _fueros_ or privileges, opposed innumerable obstacles. These\r\nwere the privileges of corporate bodies and of the professions; of the\r\nclergy, called public or common; and of the monks, canons,\r\ninquisitions, college, and universities; the privileges of persons\r\nemployed in the royal revenue service; the general privileges of the\r\nmilitary, which were extended also to the militia, and the especial\r\nprivileges of the marines, of engineers, and of the artillery. An\r\nindividual enjoying any of these privileges was elevated above the\r\ncivil authority, and, whether as plaintiff or defendant, was subject\r\nonly to the chief of the body to which he belonged, both in civil and\r\ncriminal cases. So great a number of jurisdictions created an\r\nextricable labyrinth, which, by keeping up a ceaseless conflict\r\nbetween the chiefs in regard to the extent of their powers, stimulated\r\neach one to sustain his own authority at all hazards, and, with such\r\nresoluteness as to employ even force to gain his purpose.[20] Bribery,\r\nintrigue, delay, denial of justice, outrage, ruin, were the natural\r\nresults of such a system of complicated irresponsibility; and\r\nconsequently it is not singular to find even now in Mexico and South\r\nAmerica large masses of people who are utterly ignorant of the true\r\nprinciples upon which justice should be administered or laws enacted\r\nfor its immaculate protection. The manifesto of independence issued by\r\nthe Buenos Ayrean Congress in 1816, declares that all public offices\r\nbelong exclusively to the Spaniards; and although the Americans were\r\nequally entitled to them by the laws, they were appointed only in rare\r\ninstances, and even then, not without satiating the cupidity of the\r\ncourt by enormous sums of money. Of one hundred and seventy viceroys\r\nwho governed on this continent but four were Americans; and of six\r\nhundred and ten Captains General and Governors, all but fourteen were\r\nnatives of old Spain! Thus it is evident that not only were the\r\nSpanish laws bad in their origin, but the administrative system under\r\nwhich they operated denied natives of America in almost all cases the\r\npossibility of self government.\r\n\r\nThe evil schemes of Spain did not stop, however, with the enactment of\r\nlaws, or their administration. The precious metals had originally\r\ntempted her, as we have already seen, and she did not fail to build up\r\na commercial system which was at once to bind the colonists forever to\r\nthe mines, whilst it enriched and excited her industry at home in\r\narts, manufactures, agriculture, and navigation. As the Atlantic\r\nrolled between the old world and the new, America was excluded from\r\nall easy or direct means of intercourse with other states of Europe,\r\nespecially at a period when the naval power of Spain was important,\r\nand frequent wars made the navigation of foreign merchantmen or\r\nsmugglers somewhat dangerous in the face of her cruisers. Spain\r\ntherefore interdicted all commercial intercourse between her colonies\r\nand the rest of the world, thus maintaining a strict monopoly of\r\ntrade in her own hands. All imports and exports were conveyed in\r\nSpanish bottoms, nor was any vessel permitted to sail for Vera Cruz or\r\nPorto Bello, her only two authorized American ports, except from\r\nSeville, until the year 1720, when the trade was removed to Cadiz as a\r\nmore convenient outlet. It was not until the War of the Succession\r\nthat the trade of Peru was opened, and, even then, only to the French.\r\nBy the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, Great Britain with the _asiento_, or\r\ncontract for the supply of slaves, obtained a direct participation in\r\nthe American trade, by virtue of a permission granted her to send a\r\nvessel of five hundred tons annually to the fair at Porto Bello. This\r\nprivilege ceased with the partial hostilities in 1737, but Spain found\r\nherself compelled, on the restoration of peace in 1739, to make some\r\nprovision for meeting the additional demand which the comparatively\r\nfree communication with Europe had created. Licenses were granted,\r\nwith this view, to vessels called register-ships, which were chartered\r\nduring the intervals between the usual periods for the departure of\r\nthe galeons. In 1764, a further improvement was made by the\r\nestablishment of monthly packets to Havana, Porto Rico and Buenos\r\nAyres, which were allowed to carry out half cargoes of goods. This was\r\nfollowed in 1774, by the removal of the interdict upon the intercourse\r\nof the colonies with each other; and, this again, in 1778, under what\r\nis termed a decree of free trade, by which seven of the principal\r\nports of the peninsula were allowed to carry on a direct intercourse\r\nwith Buenos Ayres and the South Sea.[21] Up to the period when these\r\ncivilized modifications of the original interdict were made, the\r\ncolonists were forbidden to trade either with foreigners or with each\r\nother's states, under any pretext whatever. The penalty of\r\ndisobedience and detection was death.\r\n\r\nHaving thus enacted that the sole vehicle of colonial commerce should\r\nbe Spanish, the next effort of the paternal government was to make the\r\nthings it conveyed Spanish also. As an adjunct in this system of\r\nimposition, the laws of the Indies prohibited the manufacture or\r\ncultivation in the colonies, of all those articles which could be\r\nmanufactured or produced in Spain. Factories were therefore inhibited,\r\nand foreign articles were permitted to enter the viceroyalties, direct\r\nfrom Spain alone, where they were, of course, subjected to duty\r\nprevious to re-exportation. But these foreign products were not\r\nallowed to be imported in unstinted quantities. Spain fixed both the\r\namount and the price; so that by extorting, ultimately, from the\r\npurchaser, the government was a gainer in charges, profits and duties;\r\nwhilst the merchants of Cadiz and Seville, who enjoyed the monopoly of\r\ntrade, were enabled to affix any valuation they pleased to their\r\ncommodities. The ingenuity of the Spaniards in contriving methods to\r\nexact the utmost farthing from their submissive colonists, is not a\r\nlittle remarkable. \"They took advantage of the wants of the settlers,\r\nand were, at one time, sparing in their supplies, so that the price\r\nmight be enhanced, whilst, at another, they sent goods of poor\r\nquality, at a rate much above their value, because it was known they\r\nmust be purchased. It was a standing practice to despatch European\r\ncommodities in such small quantities as to quicken the competition of\r\npurchasers and command an exorbitant profit. In the most flourishing\r\nperiod of the trade of Seville, the whole amount of shipping employed\r\nwas less than twenty-eight thousand tons, and many of the vessels made\r\nno more than annual voyages. The evident motive on the part of the\r\ncrown for limiting the supply was, that the same amount of revenue\r\ncould be more easily levied, and collected with more certainty as well\r\nas despatch, on a small than on a large amount of goods.\"[22]\r\n\r\nWhilst the commerce of Spain was thus burdened by enormous\r\nimpositions, the colonies were of course cramped in all their\r\nenergies. There could be no independent action of trade, manufacture,\r\nor even agriculture, under such a system.\r\n\r\nAmerica,--under the tropics and in the temperate regions, abounding in\r\na prolific soil,--was not allowed to cultivate the grape or the olive,\r\nwhilst, even some kinds of provisions which could easily have been\r\nproduced on this continent were imported from Spain.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the selfish and unnatural means by which the Council\r\nof the Indies,--whose laws have been styled, by some writers,\r\nbeneficent--sought to drain America of her wealth, whilst they created\r\na market for Spain. This was the external code of oppression; but the\r\ninternal system of this continent, which was justified and enacted by\r\nthe same council, was not less odious. Taxation, without\r\nrepresentation or self government, was the foundation of our revolt;\r\nyet, the patient colonies of Spain were forced to bear it from the\r\nbeginning of their career, so that the idea of freedom, either of\r\nopinion or of impost, never entered the minds of an American creole.\r\n\r\nDuties, taxes, and tithes were the vexatious instruments of royal\r\nplunder. The _alcabala_, an impost upon all purchases and sales,\r\nincluding even the smallest transactions, was perhaps the most\r\nburthensome. \"Every species of merchandise, whenever it passed from\r\none owner to another, was subject to a new tax; and merchants,\r\nshopkeepers and small dealers, were obliged to report the amount of\r\ntheir purchases and sales under oath.\" From the acquisition of an\r\nestate, to the simple sale of butter, eggs, or vegetables in market,\r\nall contracts and persons were subject to this tax, except travellers,\r\nclergymen and paupers. Independently of the destruction of trade,\r\nwhich must always ensue from such a system, the reader will at once\r\nobserve the temptations to vice opened by it. The natural spirit of\r\ngain tempts a dealer to cheat an oppressive government by every means\r\nin his power. It is therefore not wonderful to find the country filled\r\nwith contrabandists, and the towns with dishonest tradesmen. Men who\r\ndefraud in acts, will lie in words, nor will they hesitate to conceal\r\ntheir infamy under the sanction of an oath. Thus was it that the\r\noppressive taxation of Spain became the direct instrument of popular\r\ncorruption, and, by extending imposts to the minutest ramifications of\r\nsociety, it made the people smugglers, cheats, and perjurers. In\r\naddition to the _alcabala_, there were transit duties through the\r\ncountry, under which, it has been alleged, that European articles were\r\nsometimes taxed thirty times before they reached their consumer. The\r\nking had his royal fifth of all the gold and silver, and his\r\nmonopolies of tobacco, salt and gunpowder. He often openly vended the\r\ncolonial offices, both civil and ecclesiastical. He stamped paper, and\r\nderived a revenue from its sale. He affixed a poll tax on every\r\nIndian; and, finally, by the most infamous of all impositions, he\r\nderived an extensive revenue from the religious superstition of the\r\npeople. It was not enough to tax the necessaries and luxuries of\r\nlife,--things actually in existence and tangible,--but, through a\r\nrefined alchemy of political invention, he managed to coin even the\r\nsuperstitions of the people, and add to the royal income by the sale\r\nof \"_Bulls de cruzada_\"--\"_Bulls de defuntos_,\"--\"_Bulls for eating\r\nmilk and eggs during lent_,\"--and \"_Bulls of composition_.\" Bales upon\r\nbales of these badly printed licenses were sent out from Spain and\r\nsold by priests under the direction of a commissary. The villany of\r\nthis scheme may be more evident if we detain the reader a moment in\r\norder to describe the character of these spiritual licenses. Whoever\r\npossessed a \"Bull de cruzada\" might be absolved from all crimes except\r\nheresy; nor, could he be suspected even of so deadly a sin, as long\r\nas this talismanic paper was in his possession. Besides this, it\r\nexempted him from many of the rigorous fasts of the church; while two\r\nof them, of course, possessed double the virtue of one. The \"Bull for\r\nthe dead\" was a needful passport for a sinner's soul from purgatory.\r\nThere was no escape without it from the satanic police, and the poor\r\nand ignorant classes suffered all the pains of their miserable friends\r\nwho had gone to the other world, until they were able to purchase the\r\ninestimable ticket of release. But of all these wretched impostures,\r\nthe \"Bull of composition\" was, probably, the most shameful as well as\r\ndangerous. It \"released persons who had stolen goods from the\r\nobligation to restore them to the owner, provided the thief had not\r\nbeen moved to commit his crime in consequence of a belief that he\r\nmight escape from its sin by _subsequently_ purchasing the immaculate\r\n'Bull.'\" Nor were these all the virtues of this miraculous document.\r\nIt had the power to \"correct the moral offence of false weights and\r\nmeasures; tricks and frauds in trade; all the obliquities of principle\r\nand conduct by which swindlers rob honest folks of their property;\r\nand, finally, whilst it converted stolen articles into the lawful\r\nproperty of the thief, it also assured to purchasers the absolute\r\nownership of whatever they obtained by modes that ought to have\r\nbrought them to the gallows. The price of these Bulls depended on the\r\namount of goods stolen; but it is just to add, that only fifty of them\r\ncould be taken by the same person in a year.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThese disgusting details might suffice to show the student how greatly\r\nAmerica was oppressed and corrupted by the Spanish government; yet we\r\nregret that there are other important matters of misrule which we are\r\nnot authorised to pass by unnoticed. Thus far we have considered the\r\ndirect administration and taxing power of the king and Council of the\r\nIndies; we must now turn to the despotism exercised over the mind as\r\nwell as the body of the creoles.\r\n\r\nThe holy church held all its appointments directly from the king,\r\nthough the pope enjoyed the privilege of nomination; consequently the\r\nactual influence and power of the Hispano-American church, rested in\r\nthe sovereign. The Recopilacion de las leyes expressly prohibits the\r\nerection of cathedrals, parish churches, monasteries, hospitals,\r\nnative chapels, or other pious or religious edifices, without the\r\nexpress license of the monarch.[24] As all the ecclesiastical revenues\r\nwent to him, his power and patronage were immense. The religious\r\njurisdiction of the church tribunals extended to monasteries, priests,\r\ndonations, or legacies for sacred purposes, tithes, marriages, and all\r\n_spiritual_ concerns. The _fueros_ of the clergy have been already\r\nalluded to. \"Instead of any restraint on the claims of the\r\necclesiastics,\" says Dr. Robertson, \"the inconsistent zeal of the\r\nSpanish legislators admitted them into America to their full extent,\r\nand, at once imposed on the Spanish colonies a burden which is in no\r\nslight degree oppressive to society in its most improved state. As\r\nearly as 1501 the payment of _tithes_ as it was called, in the\r\ncolonies was enjoined, and the mode of it regulated by law. Every\r\narticle of primary necessity towards which the attention of settlers\r\nmust naturally be turned was submitted to that grievous exaction. Nor\r\nwere the demands of the clergy confined to articles of simple and easy\r\nculture. Its more artificial and operose productions, such as sugar,\r\nindigo, and cochineal, were declared to be titheable, and, in this\r\nmanner, the planter's industry was taxed in every stage of its\r\nprogress from its rudest essay to its highest improvement.\"[25] Thus\r\nit is that even now, after all the desolating revolutions that have\r\noccurred, we see the wealth of the Mexican church so exorbitantly\r\nexceeding that of the richest lay proprietors. The clergy readily\r\nbecame the royal agents in this scheme of aggrandizement; convent\r\nafter convent was built; estate after estate was added to their\r\npossessions; dollar after dollar, and diamond after diamond were cast\r\ninto their gorged treasuries, until their present accumulations are\r\nestimated at a sum not far beneath one hundred millions.[26] The\r\nmonasteries of the Dominicans and Carmelites possess immense riches,\r\nchiefly in real estate both in town and country; whilst the convents\r\nof nuns in the city of Mexico,--especially those of Concepcion,\r\nEncarnacion and Santa Terasa,--are owners of three-fourths of the\r\nprivate houses in the capital, and proportionably, of property in the\r\ndifferent states of the republic.[27]\r\n\r\nWherever the church of Rome obtained a foothold in the sixteenth\r\ncentury the HOLY INQUISITION was not long in asserting and\r\nestablishing its power. Unfortunately for the zealots of this monastic\r\ntribunal, the ignorance of the Indians did not permit them to wander\r\ninto the mazes of heresy, so that the Dominican monks found but\r\nslender employment for their cruel skill. The poor aborigines were\r\nhardly worth the trouble of persecution, for the conquerors had\r\nalready plundered them, and, unfortunately, the Jews did not emigrate\r\nto the wilds of America. The inquisition, however, could not restrain\r\nits natural love of labor, so, that, diverting its attention from the\r\nbodies of its victims it devoted itself, with the occasional\r\nrecreation of an _auto da fe_, to the spiritual guardianship of\r\nSpanish and Indian intellects. Education was of course modified and\r\nrepressed by such baneful influences. Men dared neither learn nor\r\nread, except what was selected for them by the monks. At the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century there were but three presses in Spanish\r\nAmerica,--one in Mexico, one in Lima, and one which belonged to the\r\nJesuits at Cordova; but these presses were designed for the use of the\r\ngovernment alone in the dissemination of its decrees. The eye of the\r\ninquisition was of course jealously directed to all publications.\r\nBooksellers were bound to furnish the Holy Fathers annually with a\r\nlist of their merchandise, and the fraternity was empowered to enter\r\nwheresoever it pleased, to seek and seize prohibited literature.\r\nLuther, Calvin, Vattel, Montesquieu, Puffendorff, Robertson, Addison,\r\nand even the Roman Catholic Fenelon, were all proscribed. The\r\ninquisition was the great censor of the press, and nothing was\r\nsubmitted to the people unless it had passed the fiery ordeal of the\r\nholy office. It was quite enough for a book to be wise, classical, or\r\nprogressive, to subject it to condemnation. Even viceroys and\r\ngovernors were forbidden to license the publication of a work unless\r\nthe inquisition sanctioned it; and we have seen volumes in Mexico,\r\nstill kept as curiosities in private libraries, out of which pages\r\nwere torn and passages obliterated by the Holy Fathers, before they\r\nwere permitted to be sold.[28]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Indians formed the great bulk of Hispano-American\r\npopulation, the king, of course, soon after the discovery, directed\r\nhis attention to their capabilities for labor. We have seen in a\r\nprevious part of this chapter that by a system of _repartimientos_\r\nthey were divided among the conquerors and made vassals of the land\r\nholders, although always kept distinct from the negroes who were\r\nafterwards imported from Africa. Although the Emperor Charles V.,\r\nenacted a number of mild laws for the amelioration of their fate,\r\ntheir condition seems, nevertheless, to have been very little\r\nimproved,--according to our personal observation,--even to the\r\npresent day. We have noticed that a capitation tax was levied on every\r\nIndian, and that it varied in different parts of Spanish America, from\r\nfour to fifteen dollars, according to the ability of the Indians. They\r\nwere likewise doomed to labor on the public works, as well as to\r\ncultivate the soil for the general benefit of the country, whilst by\r\nthe imposition of the _mita_ they were forced to toil in the mines\r\nunder a rigorous and debasing system which the world believed\r\naltogether unequalled in mineral districts until the British\r\nparliamentary reports of a few years past disclosed the fact, that\r\neven in England, men and women are sometimes degraded into beasts of\r\nburden in the mines whose galleries traverse in every direction the\r\nbowels of that proud kingdom.[29] Toils and suffering were the natural\r\nconditions of the poor Indian in America after the conquest, and it\r\nmight have been supposed that the plain dictates of humanity would\r\nmake the Spaniards content with the labor of their serfs, without\r\nattempting afterwards, to rob them of the wages of such ignominious\r\nlabor. But even in this, the Spanish ingenuity and avarice were not to\r\nbe foiled, for the _corregidores_ in the towns and villages, to whom\r\nwere granted the minor monopolies of almost all the necessaries of\r\nlife, made this a pretext of obliging the Indians to purchase what\r\nthey required at the prices they chose to affix to their goods.\r\nMonopoly--was the order of the day in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. Its oppressions extended through all ranks, and its\r\ngrasping advantages were eagerly seized by every magistrate from the\r\n_alguazil_ to the viceroy. The people groaned, but paid the\r\nburthensome exaction, whilst the relentless officer, hardened by the\r\ncontemplation of misery, and the constant commission of legalized\r\nrobbery, only became more watchful, sagacious and grinding in\r\nproportion as he discovered how much the down-trodden masses could\r\nbear. Benevolent viceroys and liberal kings, frequently interposed to\r\nprevent the continuance of these unjust acts, but they were unable to\r\ncope with the numerous officials who performed all the minor\r\nministerial duties throughout the colony. These inferior agents, in a\r\nnew and partially unorganized country, had every advantage in their\r\nfavor over the central authorities in the capital. The poorer\r\nSpaniards and the Indian serfs had no means of making their complaints\r\nheard in the palace. There was no press or public opinion to give\r\nvoice to the sorrows of the masses, and personal fear often silenced\r\nthe few who might have reached the ear of merciful and just rulers. At\r\ncourt, the rich, powerful and influential miners or land holders,\r\nalways discovered pliant tools who were ready by intrigue and\r\ncorruption to smother the cry of discontent, or to account plausibly\r\nfor the murmurs, which upon extraordinary occasions, burst through all\r\nrestraints until they reached either the Audiencia or the\r\nrepresentative of the sovereign. These slender excuses may, in some\r\ndegree, account for and palliate the maladministration of Spanish\r\nAmerica from the middle of the sixteenth to the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ensuing chapters of this book contain the annals of New Spain from\r\nthe foundation of the viceroyal system to the beginning of the\r\nrevolution that grew out of its corruptions. The materials for this\r\nportion of Mexican history are exceedingly scant. During the jealous\r\ndespotism and ecclesiastical vigilance of old Spanish rule, and the\r\nanarchy of modern miscalled republicanism, few authors have ventured\r\nto penetrate the gloom of this mysterious period. The Jesuit Father\r\nCavo, and Don Carlos Maria Bustamante have alone essayed to narrate,\r\nconsecutively, the events of the viceroyalty; and although no student\r\nof the past is attracted by their crude and careless style, yet we may\r\nconfidently rely on the characteristic facts detailed in their tedious\r\nwork.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Recop. de las leyes, lib. 2, title 2, ley 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Mendez, Observaciones sobre les leyes de Indias y sobre\r\nla independencia de America.

VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.\r\n1530-1551.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1530, the accusations received in Spain against Nuño de\r\nGuzman, and the _oidores_ Matinezo and Delgadillo, who at that period\r\nruled in Mexico under royal authority, were not only so frequent, but\r\nof so terrible a character, that Charles V., resolved to adopt some\r\nmeans of remedying the evils of his transatlantic subjects. He was\r\nabout to depart from Spain however, for Flanders, and charged the\r\nEmpress to adopt the necessary measures for this purpose during his\r\nabsence. This enlightened personage, perceiving the difficulty of\r\nruling so distant, extended and rich an appendage of the Spanish\r\ncrown, by inferior officials alone, wisely determined to establish a\r\nVICEROYALTY in New Spain. It was a measure which seemed to place the\r\ntwo worlds in more loyal affinity. The vice king, it was supposed,\r\nwould be the impersonation of sovereignty, the direct representative\r\nof the national head, and would always form an independent and\r\ntruthful channel of information. His position set him, eminently,\r\nabove the crowd of adventurers who were tempted to the shores of\r\nAmerica; and, removable at the royal pleasure, as well as selected\r\nfrom among those Spanish nobles whose fidelity to the crown was\r\nunquestionable, there was but little danger that even the most\r\nambitious subject would ever be tempted to alienate from the Emperor\r\nthe affection and services either of emigrants or natives.\r\n\r\nThe Empress, in fulfilling the wishes of her august spouse, at first\r\nfixed her eyes upon the Count de Oropesa and on the Marshal de\r\nFromesta, as persons well fitted to undertake the difficult charge of\r\nfounding the Mexican viceroyalty. But these individuals, upon various\r\npretexts, declined the mission, which was next tendered to Don Manuel\r\nBenavides, whose exorbitant demands for money and authority, finally\r\ninduced the sovereign to withdraw her nomination. Finally, she\r\nresolved to despatch Don Antonio de Mendoza, Count of Tendilla, one of\r\nher chamberlains, who requested only sufficient time to regulate his\r\nprivate affairs before he joyfully set forth for his viceroyalty of\r\nNew Spain. In the meantime, however, in order not to lose a moment in\r\nremedying the disorders on the other side of the Atlantic, the Empress\r\ncreated a new _Audiencia_, at the head of which was Don Sebastian\r\nRamirez de Fuenleal, bishop of St. Domingo, and whose members were the\r\n_Licenciados_ Vasco de Quiroga, Alonso Maldonado, Francisco Cainos and\r\nJuan de Salmeron. The appointment of the bishop was well justified by\r\nhis subsequent career of integrity, beneficence and wisdom; whilst\r\nVasco de Quiroga has left in Michoacan, and, indeed, in all Mexico, a\r\nvenerated name, whose renown is not forgotten, in private life and the\r\nlegends of the country to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn 1535, Mendoza arrived in Mexico with letters for the Audiencia, and\r\nwas received with all the pomp and splendor becoming the\r\nrepresentative of royalty. His instructions were couched in the most\r\nliberal terms, for, after all, it was chiefly on the personal\r\nintegrity and discretion of a viceroy that the Spanish sovereigns were\r\nobliged to rely for the sure foundation of their American empire. Of\r\nthe desire of the Emperor and Empress to act their parts justly and\r\nhonestly in the opening of this splendid drama in America there can be\r\nno doubt. Their true policy was to develope, not to destroy; and they\r\nat once perceived that, in the New World, they no longer dealt with\r\nthose organized classes of civilized society which, in Europe, yield\r\neither instinctively to the feeling of loyalty, or are easily coerced\r\ninto obedience to the laws.\r\n\r\nMendoza was commanded, in the first place, to direct his attention to\r\nthe condition of public worship; to the punishment of clergymen who\r\nscandalized their calling; to the conversion and good treatment of the\r\nIndian population, and to the erection of a mint in which silver\r\nshould be coined according to laws made upon this subject by Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella. All the wealth which was found in Indian tombs or\r\ntemples was to be sought out and devoted to the royal treasury. It was\r\nforbidden, under heavy penalties, to sell arms to negroes or Indians,\r\nand the latter were, moreover, denied the privilege of learning to\r\nwork in those more difficult or elegant branches of labor which might\r\ninterfere with the sale of Spanish imported productions.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year Mendoza received despatches from the Emperor\r\nin which, after bestowing encomiums for the manifestations of good\r\ngovernment which the viceroy had already given, he was directed to pay\r\nparticular attention to the Indians; and, together with these missives,\r\ncame a summary of the laws which the Council of the Indies had formed\r\nfor the welfare of the natives. These benevolent intentions, not only of\r\nthe sovereign but of the Spanish people also, were made known to the\r\nIndians and their caciques, upon an occasion of festivity, by a\r\nclergyman who was versed in their language, and, in a similar way, they\r\nwere disseminated throughout the whole viceroyalty. This year was,\r\nmoreover, memorable in Mexican annals as that in which the first book,\r\nentitled _La Escala de San Juan Climaca_, was published in Mexico, in\r\nthe establishment of Juan Pablos, having been printed at a press brought\r\nto the country by the viceroy Mendoza. Nor was 1536 alone signalized by\r\nthe first literary issue of the new kingdom; for the first money, as\r\nwell as the first book came at this time from the Mexican mint.\r\nAccording to Torquemada two hundred thousand dollars were coined in\r\n_copper_; but the emission of a circulating medium, in this base metal,\r\nwas so distasteful to the Mexicans, that it became necessary for the\r\nviceroy to use stringent means in order to compel its reception for the\r\nordinary purposes of trade.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1536 and 1540 the history of the Mexican viceroyalty\r\nwas uneventful, save in the gradual progressive efforts made not only\r\nby Mendoza, but by the Emperor himself, in endeavoring to model and\r\nconsolidate the Spanish empire on our continent. Schools were\r\nestablished; hospitals were erected; the protection of the Indians,\r\nunder the apostolic labors of Las Casas was honestly fostered, and\r\nevery effort appears to have been zealously made to give a permanent\r\nand domestic character to the population which found its way rapidly\r\ninto New Spain. In 1541 the copper coin, of which we have already\r\nspoken as being distasteful to the Mexicans, suddenly disappeared\r\naltogether from circulation, and it was discovered that the natives\r\nhad either buried or thrown it into the lake as utterly worthless. The\r\nviceroy endeavored to remedy the evil and dispel the popular prejudice\r\nby coining _cuartillas_ of silver; but these, from their extreme\r\nsmallness and the constant risk of loss, were equally unacceptable to\r\nthe people, who either collected large quantities and melted them\r\ninto bars, or cast them contemptuously into the water as they had\r\nbefore done with the despised copper.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about the year 1542, that we perceive in the\r\nviceroyal history, any attempts upon the part of the Indians to make\r\nformidable assaults against the Spaniards, whose oppressive and\r\ngrinding system of _repartimientos_ was undoubtedly beginning to be\r\nfelt. At this period the Indians of Jalisco rose in arms, and symptoms\r\nof discontent were observed to prevail, also, among the Tarascos and\r\nTlascalans, who even manifested an intention of uniting with the\r\nrebellious natives of the north. Mendoza was not an idle spectator of\r\nthese movements, but resolved to go forth, in person, at the head of\r\nhis troops to put down the insurgents. Accordingly he called on the\r\nTlascalans, Cholulans, Huexotzinques, Tezcocans, and other bands or\r\ntribes for support, and permitted the caciques to use horses and the\r\nsame arms that were borne by the Spaniards. This concession seems to\r\nhave greatly pleased the natives of the country, though it was\r\nunsatisfactory to some of their foreign masters.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the coasts of America on the west, and the shores of\r\nCalifornia especially, were examined by the Portuguese Juan Rodriguez\r\nCabrillo, as far north as near the 41st° of latitude; whilst another\r\nexpedition was despatched to the Spice islands, under the charge of\r\nRuy Lopez de Villalobos.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy was moreover busy with the preparation of his army\r\ndesigned to march upon Jalisco, and, on the 8th of October, 1542,\r\ndeparted from Mexico with a force of fifty thousand Indians, three\r\nhundred cavalry, and one hundred and fifty Spanish infantry. Passing\r\nthrough Michoacan, where he was detained for some time, he, at length,\r\nreached the scene of the insurrection in Jalisco; but before he\r\nattacked the rebels he proclaimed through the ecclesiastics who\r\naccompanied him, his earnest wish to accommodate difficulties, and,\r\neven, to pardon, graciously, all who would lay down their arms and\r\nreturn to their allegiance. He ordered that no prisoners should be\r\nmade except of such as were needed to transport the baggage and\r\nequipments of his troops; and, in every possible way, he manifested a\r\nhumane desire to soften the asperities and disasters of the unequal\r\nwarfare. But the rebellious Indians were unwilling to listen to\r\nterms:--\"We are lords of all these lands,\" said they, heroically, in\r\nreply, \"and we wish to die in their defence!\"\r\n\r\nVarious actions ensued between the Spaniards, their allies, and the\r\ninsurgents, until at length, Mendoza obtained such decided advantages\r\nover his opponents that they gave up the contest, threw down their\r\narms, and enabled the viceroy to return to his capital with the\r\nassurance that the revolted territory was entirely and permanently\r\npacified. His conduct to the Indians after his successes was\r\ncharacterized by all the suavity of a noble soul. He took no revenge\r\nfor this assault upon the Spanish authority, and seems, to have\r\ncontinually endeavored to win the natives to their allegiance by\r\nkindness rather than compulsion.\r\n\r\nThese outbreaks among the Indians were of course not unknown in Spain,\r\nwhere they occasioned no trifling fear for the integrity and ultimate\r\ndominion of New Spain. The natural disposition of the Emperor towards\r\nthe aborigines, was, as we have said, kind and gentle; but he\r\nperceived that the causes of these Indian discontents might be\r\nattributed not so much, perhaps, to a patriotic desire to recover\r\ntheir violated rights over the country, as to the cruelty they endured\r\nat the hands of bold and reckless adventurers who had emigrated to New\r\nSpain and converted the inoffensive children of the country into\r\nslaves. Accordingly, the Emperor, convened a council composed of\r\neminent persons in Spain, to consider the condition of his American\r\nsubjects. This council undertook the commission in a proper spirit,\r\nand adopted a liberal system towards the aborigines, as well as\r\ntowards the proprietors of estates in the islands and on the main,\r\nwhich, in time, would have fostered the industry and secured the\r\nultimate prosperity of all classes. There were to be no slaves made in\r\nthe future wars of these countries; the system of _repartimientos_ was\r\nto be abandoned; and the Indians were not, as a class, to be solely\r\ndevoted to ignoble tasks.[31] The widest publicity was given to these\r\nhumane intentions in Spain. The Visitador of Hispaniola, or San\r\nDomingo, Miguel Diaz de Armendariz, was directed to see their strict\r\nfulfilment in the islands; and Francisco Tello de Sandoval was\r\ncommissioned to cross the Atlantic to Mexico, with full powers and\r\ninstructions from the Emperor, to enforce their obedience in New Spain.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1544, this functionary disembarked at St. Juan de Ulua,\r\nand, a month afterwards, arrived in the capital. No sooner did he\r\nappear in Mexico than the object of his mission became gradually\r\nnoised about among the proprietors and planters whose wealth depended\r\nchiefly upon the preservation of their estates and Indians in the\r\nservile condition in which they were before the assemblage of the\r\nEmperor's council in Spain during the previous year. Every effort was\r\ntherefore made by these persons and their sattelites to prevent the\r\nexecution of the royal will. Appeals were addressed to Sandoval\r\ninvoking him to remain silent. He was cautioned not to interfere with\r\na state of society upon which the property of the realm depended. The\r\nruin of many families, the general destruction of property, the\r\ncomplete revolution of the American system, were painted in glowing\r\ncolors, by these men who pretended to regard the just decrees of the\r\nEmperor as mere \"innovations\" upon the established laws of New Spain.\r\nBut Sandoval was firm, and he was stoutly sustained in his honorable\r\nloyalty to his sovereign and christianity, by the countenance of the\r\nviceroy Mendoza. Accordingly, the imperial decrees were promulgated\r\nthroughout New Spain, and resulted in seditious movements among the\r\ndisaffected proprietors which became so formidable that the peace of\r\nthe country was seriously endangered. In this dilemma,--feeling,\r\nprobably, that the great mass of the people was the only bulwark of\r\nthe government against the Indians, and that it was needful to\r\nconciliate so powerful a body,--permission was granted by the\r\nauthorities, to appoint certain representatives as a commission to lay\r\nthe cause before the Emperor himself. Accordingly two delegates were\r\ndespatched to Spain together with the provincials of San Francisco,\r\nSanto Domingo and San Agustin, and other Spaniards of wealth and\r\ninfluence in the colony.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, Sandoval, who had somewhat relaxed his\r\nauthority, took upon himself the dangerous task of absolutely\r\nenforcing the orders of the Emperor with some degree of strictness,\r\nnotwithstanding the visit of the representatives of the discontented\r\nMexicans to Spain. He displaced several _oidores_ and other officers\r\nwho disgraced their trusts, and deprived various proprietors of their\r\n_repartimientos_ or portions of Indians who had been abused by the\r\ncruel exercise of authority. But, in the meantime, the agents had not\r\nceased to labor at the court in Spain. Money, influence, falsehood and\r\nintrigue were freely used to sustain the system of masked slavery\r\namong the subjugated natives, and, at last, a royal _cedula_ was\r\nprocured commanding the revocation of the humane decrees and ordering\r\nthe division of the royal domain among the conquerors. The Indians, of\r\ncourse, followed the fate of the soil; and thus, by chicanery and\r\ninfluence, the gentle efforts of the better portion of Spanish society\r\nwere rendered entirely nugatory. The news of this decree spread joy\r\namong the Mexican landed proprietors. The chains of slavery were\r\nrivetted upon the natives. The principle of compulsory labor was\r\nestablished forever; and, even to this day, the Indian of Mexico\r\nremains the bondsman he was doomed to become in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1540 and 1542, an expedition was undertaken for the\r\nsubjugation of an important nation which it was alleged existed far to\r\nthe north of Mexico. A Franciscan missionary, Marcos de Naza, reported\r\nthat he had discovered, north of Sonora, a rich and powerful people\r\ninhabiting a realm known as Quivara, or the seven cities, whose\r\ncapital, Cibola, was quite as civilized as an European city. After the\r\nreport had reached and been considered in Spain, it was determined to\r\nsend an armed force to this region in order to explore, and if\r\npossible to reduce the Quivarans to the Spanish yoke. Mendoza had\r\ndesigned to entrust this expedition to Pedro de Alvarado, after having\r\nrefused Cortéz permission to lead the adventurers,--a task which he\r\nhad demanded as his right. But when all the troops were enlisted,\r\nAlvarado had not yet reached Mexico from Guatemala, and, accordingly,\r\nthe viceroy despatched Vasquez de Coronado, at the head of the\r\nenterprise. At the same time he fitted out another expedition, with\r\ntwo ships, under the orders of Francisco Alarcon, who was to make a\r\nreconnoisance of the coast as far as the thirty-sixth degree, and,\r\nafter having frequently visited the shores, he was, in that latitude\r\nto meet the forces sent by land.\r\n\r\nCoronado set forth from Culiacan, with three hundred and fifty\r\nSpaniards and eight hundred Indians, and, after reaching the source of\r\nthe Gila, passed the mountains to the Rio del Norte. He wintered twice\r\nin the region now called New Mexico, explored it thoroughly from north\r\nto south, and then, striking off to the north east, crossed the\r\nmountains and wandering eastwardly as far north as the fortieth degree\r\nof latitude, he unfortunately found neither Quivara nor gold. A few\r\nwretched ruins of Indian villages were all the discoveries made by\r\nthese hardy pioneers, and thus the enchanted kingdom eluded the grasp\r\nof Spain forever. The troop of strangers and Indians soon became\r\ndisorganized and disbanded; nor was Alarcon more successful by sea\r\nthan Coronado by land. His vessels explored the shores of the Pacific\r\ncarefully, but they found no wealthy cities to plunder, nor could the\r\nsailors hear of any from the Indians with whom they held intercourse.\r\n\r\nIn 1546, a desolating pestilence swept over the land, destroying,\r\naccording to some writers, eight hundred thousand Indians, and,\r\naccording to others, five-sixths of the whole population. It lasted\r\nfor about six months; and, at this period, a projected insurrection\r\namong the black slaves and the Tenochan and Tlaltelolcan Indians, was\r\ndetected through a negro. This menaced outbreak was soon crushed by\r\nMendoza, who seized and promptly executed the ringleaders.\r\n\r\nA portion of the Visitador Sandoval's orders related to the convocation\r\nof the Mexican bishops with a view to the spiritual welfare of the\r\nnatives, and the prelates were accordingly all summoned to the capital,\r\nwith the exception of the virtuous Las Casas, whose humane efforts in\r\nbehalf of the Indians, and whose efforts to free them from the slavery\r\nof the _repartimientos_ had subjected him to the mortal hatred of the\r\nplanters. The council of ecclesiastics met; but it is probable that\r\ntheir efforts were quite as ineffectual as the humane decrees of the\r\nEmperor, and that even in the church itself, there may have been persons\r\nwho were willing to tolerate the involuntary servitude of the natives\r\nrather than forego the practical and beneficial enjoyment of estates\r\nwhich were beginning to fall into the possession of convents and\r\nmonastaries on the death of pious penitents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the population of New Spain increased considerably,\r\nespecially towards the westward. It was soon perceived by Mendoza that\r\na single Audiencia was no longer sufficient for so extended a country.\r\nHe, therefore, recommended the appointment of another, in Compostella\r\nde la Nueva Gallacia, and in 1547, the Emperor ordered two _letrados_\r\nfor the administration of justice in that quarter. The ultimate\r\nreduction of the province of Vera-Paz was likewise accomplished at\r\nthis period. The benignant name of \"True Peace\" was bestowed on this\r\nterritory from the fact that the inhabitants yielded gracefully and\r\nspeedily to the persuasive influence and spiritual conquest of the\r\nDominican monks, and that not a single soldier was needed to teach\r\nthem the religion of Christ at the point of the sword.\r\n\r\nDuring the two or three following years there was but little to disturb\r\nthe quietness of the colony, save in brief and easily suppressed\r\noutbreaks among the Indians. Royal lands were divided among poor and\r\nmeritorious Spaniards; property which was found to be valueless in the\r\nneighborhood of cities was allowed to be exchanged for mountain tracts,\r\nin which the eager adventurers supposed they might discover mineral\r\nwealth; and the valuable mines of Tasco, Zultepec, and Temascaltepec,\r\ntogether with others, probably well known to the ancient Mexicans, were\r\nonce more thrown open and diligently worked.\r\n\r\nThe wise administration of the Mexican viceroyalty by Mendoza had\r\nbeen often acknowledged by the Emperor. He found in this distinguished\r\nperson a man qualified by nature to deal with the elements of a new\r\nsociety when they were in their wildest moments of confusion, and\r\nbefore they had become organized into the order and system of a\r\nregular state. Mendoza, by nature firm, amiable, and just, seems\r\nnevertheless to have been a person who knew when it was necessary in a\r\nnew country, to bend before the storm of popular opinion in order to\r\navoid the destruction, not only of his own influence, but perhaps of\r\nsociety, civilization and the Spanish authorities themselves. In the\r\nmidst of all the fiery and unregulated spirit of a colony like Mexico,\r\nhe sustained the dignity of his office unimpaired, and by command,\r\ndiplomacy, management, and probably sometimes by intrigue, he appears\r\nto have ensured obedience to the laws even when they were distasteful\r\nto the masses. He was successful upon all occasions except in the\r\nenforcement of the complete emancipation of the Indians; but it may be\r\nquestioned whether he did not deem it needful, in the infancy of the\r\nviceroyalty at least, to subject the Indians to labors which his\r\ncountrymen were either too few in number or too little acclimated in\r\nMexico to perform successfully. History must at least do him the\r\njustice to record the fact that his administration was tempered with\r\nmercy, for even the Indians revered him as a man who was their signal\r\nprotector against wanton inhumanity.\r\n\r\nWhilst these events occurred in Mexico, Pizarro had subjugated Peru,\r\nand added it to the Spanish crown. But there, as in Mexico, an able\r\nman was needed to organize the fragmentary society which was in the\r\nutmost disorder after the conquest. No one appeared to the Emperor\r\nbetter fitted for the task than the viceroy whose administration had\r\nbeen so successful in Mexico. Accordingly, in 1550, the viceroyalty of\r\nPeru was offered to him, and its acceptance urged by the Emperor at a\r\nmoment when a revolt against the Spaniards occurred among the\r\nZapotecas, instigated by their old men and chiefs, who, availing\r\nthemselves of an ancient prophecy relative to the return of\r\nQUETZALCOATL, assured the youths and warriors of their tribe that the\r\npredicted period had arrived and that, under the protection of their\r\nrestored deity, their chains would be broken. In this, as in all other\r\nendeavors to preserve order, the efforts of Mendoza were successful.\r\nHe appeased the Indians, accepted the proffered task of governing\r\nPeru; and, after meeting and conferring with his successor, Velasco,\r\nin Cholula, departed from Mexico for the scene of his new labors on\r\nthe distant shores of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Herrera Decade vii., lib. vi., chap. v.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1551-1564.\r\n\r\n    VELASCO ENDEAVORS TO AMELIORATE THE CONDITION OF THE\r\n    INDIANS.--UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO ESTABLISHED--INUNDATION.--MILITARY\r\n    COLONIZATION--PHILIP II.--FLORIDA.--INTRIGUES AGAINST\r\n    VELASCO--PHILIPINE ISLES.--DEATH OF VELASCO--MARQUES DE\r\n    FALCES.--BAPTISM OF THE GRAND CHILDREN OF CORTÉZ.--CONSPIRACY\r\n    AGAINST THE MARQUES DEL VALLE--HIS ARREST--EXECUTION OF HIS\r\n    FRIENDS.--MARQUES DE FALCES--CHARGES AGAINST HIM--HIS\r\n    FALL.--ERRORS OF PHILIP II.--FALL OF MUÑOZ AND HIS\r\n    RETURN.--VINDICATION OF THE VICEROY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON LUIS DE VELASCO, II. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1551-1564.\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy, Don Luis de Velasco, arrived in Mexico without\r\nespecial orders changing the character of the government. He was\r\nselected by the Emperor as a person deemed eminently fitted to sustain\r\nthe judicious policy of his predecessor; and it is probable that he\r\nhad secret commands from the court to attempt once more the\r\namelioration of the Indian population. There is no doubt that Charles\r\nthe Fifth was sincere in his wish to protect the natives; and, if he\r\nyielded at all,--as we have seen in the narrative of the last\r\nviceroyalty,--to the demands of the owners of _repartimientos_, it was\r\nprobably with the hope that a better opportunity of sustaining his\r\nhumane desires would occur as soon as the conquerors or their\r\nfollowers, were glutted by the rich harvests they might reap during\r\nthe early years of the settlement.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find, as soon as Velasco had been received in Mexico\r\nwith all suitable ceremony and honor, that, notwithstanding the\r\ncontinued opposition of the proprietors and planters, he proclaimed\r\nhis determination to carry out the orders that had been given to\r\nMendoza, so far as they tended to relieve the Indians from the\r\npersonal labors, tributes, and severe service in the mines with which\r\nthey had been burdened by the conquerors. This, as was expected,\r\ncreated extraordinary discontent. The cupidity of the sovereign and of\r\nhis representative were appealed to. It was alleged that not only\r\nwould the Spanish emigrants suffer for the want of laborers, but that\r\nthe royal treasury would soon be emptied of the taxes and income\r\nwhich, thus far, had regularly flowed into it. But Don Luis was firm\r\nin his resolution, and declared that \"the liberty of the Indians was\r\nof more importance than all the mines in the world, and that the\r\nrevenues they yielded to the Spanish crown were not of such a\r\ncharacter that all divine and human laws should be sacrificed, in\r\norder to obtain them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1553, the attention of the viceroy was specially directed to the\r\nsubject of education, for the population had so greatly increased in\r\nthe few years of stable government, that unless the best means of\r\ninstructing the growing generation were speedily adopted, it was\r\nprobable that New Spain would lose many of the descendants of those\r\nfamilies which it was the policy of the crown to establish permanently\r\nin America. The University of Mexico was therefore consecrated and\r\nopened in this year; and, in 1555, Paul IV., bestowed upon it the same\r\nprivileges and rights as were enjoyed by that of Salamanca in Spain.\r\n\r\nBut this was a sad year for the city of Mexico, in other respects. The\r\nfirst inundation since the conquest, occurred in 1553, and for three\r\ndays the capital was under water and the communication kept up in\r\nboats and canoes. Every effort was made by the viceroy to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of the evil, by the erection of a dyke to dam up the waters\r\nof the lake; and it is related by contemporary historians, that he\r\neven wrought with his own hands at the gigantic work, during the first\r\nday, in order to show a good example to the citizens who were called\r\non to contribute their personal labor for their future protection from\r\nsuch a disaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were few outbreaks among the Indians during this viceroyalty,\r\nyet there were troublesome persons among the original tribes of the\r\nChichimecas,--some bands of whom were not yet entirely subjected to\r\nthe Spanish government,--who contrived to keep up a guerilla warfare,\r\nwhich interrupted the free circulation of the Spaniards through the\r\nplains and mountain passes of the Bajio. These were, in all\r\nprobability, mere predatory attacks; but as it was impossible for the\r\nviceroy to spare sufficient numbers of faithful soldiers for the\r\npurpose of scouring the hiding places and fastnesses of these robber\r\nbands, he resolved to found a number of villages composed of natives\r\nand foreigners, and to place in them, permanently, sufficient numbers\r\nof troops to protect the adjacent country roads, and to form the\r\nnucleus of towns, which, in the course of time, would grow to\r\nimportance. Such was the origin, by military colonization, of San\r\nFelipe Yztlahuaca, and of San Miguel el Grande, now known as Allende,\r\nfrom the hero of that name to whom it gave birth. It was the constant\r\npolicy of the Emperor to extend the avenues of industry for his\r\nemigrant subjects by such a system of security and protection; and,\r\naccordingly, Don Francisco Ibarra, was despatched to the interior with\r\norders to explore the northern and western regions, but, on no\r\naccount, to use arms against the natives except in case of the utmost\r\nurgency. Ibarra traversed a wide and nearly unknown region, discovered\r\nrich mines of gold and silver, and colonized many places of\r\nconsiderable importance in the subsequent development of Mexico, and\r\namong them, the city of Durango, which is now the capital of the state\r\nof that name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe abdication of Charles V. was unofficially announced in Mexico in\r\n1556; but it was not until the 6th of June of the following year that\r\nhis successor Philip II. was proclaimed in the capital of New Spain.\r\nThe policy of the old Emperor was not changed by the accession of the\r\nnew king; nor does the monarch appear to have influenced in any\r\nparticular manner the destiny of Mexico during the continuance of\r\nVelasco's government, except by the fitting out, at his special\r\ncommand, under the order of his viceroy, of an expedition for the\r\nconquest of Florida, which proved disastrous to all concerned in it.\r\nCrowds flocked in the year 1558 to the standard raised for this\r\nadventure, which it was supposed would result in gratifying the\r\nSpanish thirst for gold. In the following year the few who remained of\r\nthe untoward enterprise, returned with their commanders to Havana and\r\nthence to New Spain.\r\n\r\nThus far Velasco's administration had been successful in preserving\r\nthe peace in Mexico,--in opening the resources of the country in\r\nmines, agriculture and pastoral affairs,--and in alleviating the\r\ncondition of the Indians by gradual restraints on his countrymen. His\r\npower was unlimited; but he had, in no instance abused it, or\r\ncountenanced its abuse in others. Anxious not to rely exclusively upon\r\nhis own resources, but to take council from the best authorities in\r\ncases of difficulty or doubt, he invariably consulted the Audiencia in\r\nall emergencies. But, just and loyal as had been his official conduct,\r\nit had not saved him from creating enemies; and these, unfortunately,\r\nwere not only found among the rich oppressors whose shameless conduct\r\nhe strove to punish, but even among the members of the Audiencia\r\nitself. These men combined secretly to undermine the influence of the\r\nviceroy, and despatched commissioners to Spain, who represented to the\r\nking that the health of his representative was in a failing state, and\r\nthat it was extremely needful he should be sustained by a council\r\nwhose duty it was to direct him upon all questions of public interest.\r\nThe intriguers were successful in their appeal, and a decree soon\r\narrived in New Spain announcing that the viceroy should thenceforth do\r\nnothing without the previous sanction of the Audiencia. This order of\r\nthe king immediately put the power into the hands of individuals whose\r\nobject was rather to acquire sudden wealth than to govern a new and\r\nsemi-civilized nation justly, or to enact laws which would develope\r\nthe resources of the country. The viceroy had been impartial. He held\r\nthe balance between the Indian laborer and the Spanish extortioner.\r\nHis office and emoluments placed him, at that period, high above the\r\nordinary temptations of avarice. But the Audiencia, composed of\r\nseveral persons, whose position was far inferior to the viceroy's, was\r\naccessible to intrigue and corruption, and the unfortunate Indians\r\nsoon found to their cost, that the royal limitation on Velasco's power\r\nhad lost them a friend and staunch supporter. The Audiencia and the\r\nviceroy were soon surrounded by parties who advocated their different\r\ncauses with zeal; but the loyal viceroy did not murmur in the\r\ndischarge of his duty and faithfully followed the order of the king to\r\nsubmit his judgment to the council. Nevertheless all were not so\r\npatient as Velasco. Counter statements were sent, by skilful\r\nadvocates, to Spain; and Velasco himself required an examination to be\r\nmade into his official conduct.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Philip II. appointed a certain _licenciado_ Valderrama,\r\nas visitador of New Spain, who arrived in 1563, and immediately began\r\nthe discharge of his functions by a course of exaction, especially\r\nfrom the Indians, which neither the appeals nor the arguments of the\r\nviceroy could induce him to abandon. The arrival of this harsh and\r\ncruel personage, was, indeed, sad for Mexico, and, in the country's\r\nhistory, he still retains the name of \"El Molestador de los Indios.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for Velasco an escape from the double tyranny of the\r\nAudiencia and of Valderrama was opened to him in an expedition to the\r\nPhilipine islands which the king had ordered him to colonize. But\r\nwhilst he was engaged in organizing his forces and preparing for the\r\nvoyage, his health suddenly gave way, and on the 31st of July, 1564,\r\nhe expired amid the general grief of all the worthier classes of\r\nMexico, and, especially, of the Indians, whom he had befriended. Death\r\nsilenced the murmurs of the intriguers. When the beneficent viceroy\r\ncould no longer interfere with the selfish interests of the multitude,\r\ncrowds flocked around his bier to honor his harmless remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON GASTON DE PERALTA, MARQUES DE FALCES, III. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.\r\n1564-1568.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Don Luis de Velasco the First, the reins of government\r\nremained in the hands of the Royal Audiencia, in conformity with the\r\norder of Philip II. Francisco de Zeinos, Pedro de Villalobos, and\r\nGeronimo de Orozoco were then the oidores; while Valderrama, whose\r\nvisit occurred during the government of Don Luis de Velasco, as we\r\nhave already narrated, had departed for Spain. In 1564, the expedition\r\nwhich was planned and prepared under the last viceroy, sailed for the\r\nPhilipine islands, and founded the celebrated city of Manilla, which\r\nhas since played so distinguished a part in the history of oriental\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe year 1566 was an important one, at least in the social history of\r\nMexico, for it was fraught with danger to the son and representative\r\nof the illustrious conqueror. The Marques del Valle, heir of Hernando\r\nCortéz, had been for sometime established in the capital, where he\r\nformed the nucleus of a noble circle, and was admired by all classes\r\nfor the splendor with which he maintained the honor of his house. His\r\npalace was constantly filled with the flower of Mexican aristocracy,\r\nand among the knightly train of gallant men, few were more\r\ndistinguished for gentle bearing and personal accomplishment than\r\nAlonso de Avila Alvarado, and his brother Gil Gonzalez. The Marques\r\ndel Valle, distinguished the former by his special attentions, and\r\nthis, together with the imprudent conduct or expressions of Alonso,\r\nmade him suspected by persons who simulated an extraordinary zeal for\r\nthe Spanish monarchy, whilst, in fact, their chief object was to\r\ningratiate themselves with men of power or influence in order to\r\nfurther their private interests.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1566, the Dean of the Cathedral, Don Juan Chico\r\nde Molina, baptized in that sacred edifice, the twin daughters of the\r\nMarques del Valle, whose sponsors were Don Lucas de Castilla and Doña\r\nJuana de Sosa. The festivities of the gallant Marques upon this\r\noccasion of family rejoicing, were, as usual among the rich in Spanish\r\ncountries, attended with the utmost magnificence; and in order to\r\npresent our readers a picture of the manners of the period, we shall\r\ndescribe the scene as it is related by those who witnessed it.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of general rejoicing and festivity in the city of Mexico.\r\nFrom the palace of the Marques to the door of the cathedral, a passage\r\nwas formed under lofty and splendid canopies composed of the richest\r\nstuffs. A salute of artillery announced the entry of the twins into\r\nthe church, and it was repeated at their departure. At the moment when\r\nthe rites of religion were completed and the infants were borne back\r\nto their home through the covered way, the spectators in the _plaza_\r\nwere amused by a chivalric tournament between twelve knights in\r\ncomplete steel. Other rare and costly diversions succeeded in an\r\nartificial grove, which the Marques had caused to be erected in the\r\n_plazuela_, or lesser square, intervening between his palace and the\r\ncathedral. Nor were these amusements designed alone for persons of his\r\nown rank, for the masses of the people were also summoned to partake\r\nhis bountiful hospitality. At the doors of his princely dwelling\r\ntables were sumptuously spread with roasted oxen, all kinds of wild\r\nfowl and numberless delicacies, whilst two casks of white and red\r\nwine,--then esteemed in Mexico the most luxurious rarities,--were set\r\nflowing for the people.\r\n\r\nAt night, Alonso Gonzalez de Avila, the intimate companion of the\r\nMarques, entertained the chief personages of Mexico with a splendid\r\nball, during which there was a performance, or symbolical masque\r\nrepresenting the reception of Hernando Cortéz by the Emperor Montezuma.\r\nAlonso, splendidly attired, sustained the part of the Mexican sovereign.\r\nDuring one of the evolutions of the spectacle, Avila threw around the\r\nneck of the young Marques a collar of intermingled flowers and jewels,\r\nsimilar to the one with which his father had been adorned by Montezuma;\r\nand, at the conclusion of the scene, he placed on the heads of the\r\nMarques and his wife a coronet of laurel, with the exclamation,--\"How\r\nwell these crowns befit your noble brows!\"\r\n\r\nThese simple diversions of a family festival were, doubtless,\r\naltogether innocent, and, certainly, not designed to prefigure an\r\nintention upon the part of the Marques and his friends to usurp the\r\ngovernment of the New World. But it is probable that he had unwisely\r\nmade enemies of men in power who were either ridiculously suspicious,\r\nor eagerly sought for any pretext, no matter how silly, to lay violent\r\nhands upon the son of Cortéz. It is probable, too, that the\r\nprestige,--the moral power,--of the great conqueror's name had not yet\r\nceased to operate in Mexico; and, in those days when individuals were\r\nnot dainty in ridding themselves of dangerous intruders, it is not\r\nunlikely that it was the policy of the Audiencia and its coadjutors to\r\ndrive the gallant Marques from scenes, which, in the course of time,\r\nmight tempt his ambition. The extreme popularity of such a man was not\r\nto be tolerated.\r\n\r\nHowever, the domestic festival, symbolical as it was deemed by some of\r\na desire to foreshadow the destiny of the son of Cortéz, was allowed\r\nto pass over. The oidores and their spies, meditating in secret over\r\nthe crowning of Cortéz and his wife by Avila, and the remarkable words\r\nby which the graceful act was accompanied, resolved to embrace the\r\nfirst opportunity to detect what they declared was a conspiracy to\r\nwrest the dominion of New Spain from Philip II.\r\n\r\nWhen men are anxious to commit a crime, a pretext or an occasion is not\r\ngenerally long wanting to accomplish the wicked design. Accordingly we\r\nfind that on the 13th of August, the anniversary of the capture of the\r\ncapital, the alleged conspiracy, was to break out. A national\r\nprocession, in honor of the day, was to pass along the street of San\r\nFrancisco and to return through that which now bears the name of Tacuba.\r\nCertain armed bands, convened under the pretext of military display,\r\nwere to be stationed in the way, while, from a small turret in which he\r\nhad concealed himself, Don Martin Cortéz, the son of the conqueror by\r\nthe Indian girl Mariana, was to sally forth, and seize the royal\r\nstandard, and being immediately joined by the armed bands, was,\r\nforthwith, to proclaim the Marques del Valle king of Mexico and to slay\r\nthe oidores as well as all who should offer the least resistance.\r\n\r\nSuch was the story which the authorities had heard or feigned to have\r\nheard through their trusty spies. Nearly a month before the dreaded\r\nday, however, the Audiencia assembled, and requested the presence of\r\nthe Marques del Valle, under the pretext that despatches had been\r\nreceived from the king of Spain, which, by his special order, were\r\nonly to be opened in presence of the son of Cortéz. The Marques, who\r\nimagined no evil, immediately responded to the call of the oidores,\r\nand the moment he entered the hall the doors were guarded by armed\r\nmen. Cortéz was ordered to seat himself on a common stool, while one\r\nof the functionaries announced to him that he was a prisoner, in the\r\nname of the king. \"For what?\" eagerly demanded the Marques. \"As a\r\ntraitor to his Majesty!\" was the foul reply. \"_You lie!_\" exclaimed\r\nCortéz, springing from his seat, and grasping the hilt of his\r\ndagger;--\"I am no traitor to my king,--nor are there traitors among\r\nany of my lineage!\"\r\n\r\nThe natural excitement of the loyal nobleman subsided after a moment's\r\nreflection. He had been entrapped into the hands of the Audiencia, and\r\nfinding himself completely, though unjustly, in their power, he at\r\nonce resolved to offer no childish opposition, when resistance would\r\nbe so utterly useless. With the manly dignity of a chivalrous\r\nSpaniard, he immediately yielded up his weapons and was taken prisoner\r\nto the apartments that had been prepared for him. His half brother,\r\nDon Martin, was also apprehended, and orders were sent to the city of\r\nTezcoco for the seizure of Don Luis Cortéz who resided there as\r\njustice or governor. In Mexico, Alonso Avila Alvarado, and his brother\r\nGil Gonzalez, with many other distinguished men were incarcerated, and\r\nthe papers of all the prisoners were, of course, seized and eagerly\r\nscrutinized by the sattelites who hoped to find in them a confirmation\r\nof the imaginary conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAmong the documents of Alonso de Avila a large number of love letters\r\nwere found; but neither in his papers nor in those of his brother, or\r\nof the many victims of these foul suspicions, who languished in\r\nprison, did they discover a single line to justify their arrest.\r\nNevertheless, Don Alonso and his brother Don Gil Gonzalez, were\r\nsingled out as victims and doomed to death. The authorities dared not,\r\nprobably, strike at a person so illustrious and so popular as the\r\nMarques del Valle; but they resolved to justify, in the public eye,\r\ntheir inquisitorial investigation, by the sacrifice of some one. The\r\npublic would believe that there was in reality a crime when the\r\nscaffold reeked with blood; and, besides, the blow would fall heaviest\r\non the family of Cortéz when it struck the cherished companions of his\r\nhome and heart.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August, at seven in the evening, Alonso and Gil Gonzalez\r\nwere led forth to the place of execution in front of the Casa de\r\nCabildo. Their heads were struck off and stuck on spears on the roof\r\nof the edifice; whence they were finally taken, at the earnest\r\nremonstrance of the Ayuntamiento, and buried with the bodies of the\r\nvictims in the church of San Agustin. Every effort had been made to\r\nsave the lives of these truly innocent young men. But although the\r\nprincipal persons in the viceroyalty, united in the appeal for mercy\r\nif not for justice, the inexorable oidores carried out their\r\nremorseless and bloody decree. It is even asserted that these cruel\r\nmen would not have hesitated to inflict capital punishment upon the\r\nMarques himself had not the new viceroy, Don Gaston de Peralta,\r\nMarques de Falces, arrived at San Juan de Ulua, on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, 1566.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this personage reached Mexico he began to enquire into the\r\noutrage. He was quickly satisfied that the whole proceeding was\r\nfounded in malice. The oidores were removed, and others being placed\r\nin their posts, the viceroy despatched a missive to the court of Spain\r\ncontaining his views and comments upon the conduct of the late\r\nofficials. But the document was sent by a man who was secretly a warm\r\nfriend of the brutal oidores, and, to save them from the condign\r\npunishment they deserved, he withheld it from the king.\r\n\r\nYet these functionaries, still fearing that their crime would be finally\r\npunished, not only treacherously intercepted the despatch of the\r\nviceroy, but also took the speediest opportunity to send to the king\r\naccusations against Don Gaston himself, in which they charged him with\r\nnegligence in his examination of the conspiracy, with treasonable\r\nalliance with the Marques del Valle, and with a design to usurp the\r\ngovernment of New Spain. They founded their allegations upon the false\r\noaths of several deponents, who alleged that the viceroy had already\r\nprepared and held at his orders thirty thousand armed men. This base\r\nimposture, as ridiculous as it was false, originated in an act of\r\nPeralta which was altogether innocent. Being a man of fine taste, and\r\ndetermining that the viceroyal residence should be worthy the abode of\r\nhis sovereign's representative, he caused the palace to be refitted,\r\nand, among the adornments of the various saloons, he ordered a large\r\npainting to be placed on the walls of one of the chambers in which a\r\nbattle was represented containing an immense number of combatants. This\r\nwas the army which the witnesses, upon their oaths, represented to the\r\nking, as having been raised and commanded by the viceroy! It can\r\nscarcely be supposed possible that the Audiencia of Mexico would have\r\nresorted to such flimsy means to cover their infamy. It seems incredible\r\nthat such mingled cruelty and childishness could ever have proceeded\r\nfrom men who were deputed to govern the greatest colony of Spain. Yet\r\nsuch is the unquestionable fact, and it indicates, at once, the\r\ncharacter of the age and of the men who managed, through the intrigues\r\nof court, to crawl to eminence and power which they only used to\r\ngratify vindictive selfishness or to glut their inordinate avarice.\r\n\r\nPhilip the II. could not, at first, believe the accusations of the\r\noidores against the family of Cortéz and the distinguished nobleman\r\nwhom he had sent to represent him in Mexico. He resolved, therefore,\r\nto wait the despatches of the viceroy. But the oidores had been too\r\nwatchful to allow those documents to reach the court of Spain; and\r\nPhilip, therefore, construing the silence of Don Gaston de Peralta,\r\ninto a tacit confession of his guilt, sent the _Licenciados_ Jaraba,\r\nMuñoz, and Carillo to New Spain, as _Jueces Pesquisidores_, with\r\nletters for the viceroy commanding him to yield up the government and\r\nto return to Spain in order to account for his conduct.\r\n\r\nThese men immediately departed on their mission and arrived safely in\r\nAmerica without accident, save in the death of Jaraba one of their\r\ncolleagues. As soon as they reached Mexico, they presented their\r\ndespatches to the viceroy, and Muñoz took possession of the government\r\nof New Spain. The worthy and noble Marques de Falces was naturally\r\nstunned by so unprecedented and unexpected a proceeding; but,\r\nsatisfied of the justice of his cause as well as of the purity of his\r\nconduct, he left the capital and retired to the castle of San Juan de\r\nUlua, leaving the reins of power in the hands of Muñoz whose\r\ntyrannical conduct soon destroyed all the confidence which hitherto\r\nhad always existed, at least between the Audiencia and the people of\r\nthe metropolis.[32] It was probably before this time that the Marques\r\ndel Valle was released;--and deeming the new empire which his father\r\nhad given to Spain no safe resting place for his descendants, he\r\ndeparted once more for the Spanish court. The viceroy himself had\r\nfallen a victim to deception and intrigue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been one of the weaknesses of Philip the Second's\r\ncharacter to have but little confidence in men. With such examples as\r\nwe have just seen, it may, nevertheless, have been an evidence of his\r\nwisdom that he did not rely upon the courtiers who usually surround a\r\nking. He had doubted, in reality, the actual guilt of the Marques de\r\nFalces, and was, therefore, not surprised when he learned the truth\r\nupon these weighty matters in the year 1568. The government of Muñoz,\r\nhis visitador, was, moreover, represented to him as cruel and bloody.\r\nThe conduct of the previous Audiencia had been humane when compared\r\nwith the acting governor's. The prisons, which already existed in\r\nMexico were not adequate to contain his victims, and he built others\r\nwhose dark, damp and narrow architecture rendered incarceration doubly\r\npainful to the sufferers. Don Martin Cortéz, the half brother of the\r\nMarques del Valle, who remained in the metropolis as the attorney and\r\nrepresentative of his kinsman, was seized and put to torture for no\r\ncrime save that the blood of the conqueror flowed in his veins, and\r\nthat he had enjoyed friendly relations with the suspected\r\nconspirators. Torture, it was imagined would wring from him a\r\nconfession which might justify the oidores. The situation of New Spain\r\ncould not, indeed, be worse than it was, for no man felt safe in the\r\nmidst of such unrestrained power and relentless cruelty; and we may be\r\npermitted to believe that outraged humanity would soon have risen to\r\nvindicate itself against such brutes and to wrest the fruits of the\r\nconquest from a government that sent forth such wicked sattelites.\r\nEven the Audiencia itself,--the moving cause of this new and bad\r\ngovernment,--began to tremble when it experienced the humiliating\r\ncontempt with which it was invariably treated by the monster Muñoz.\r\n\r\nBut all these acts of maladministration were more safely reported to\r\nthe Spanish court by the nobles and oidores of Mexico, than the\r\ndespatches of the unfortunate Marques de Falces. Philip eagerly\r\nresponded to the demand for the removal of Muñoz. He despatched the\r\noidores Villanueva and Vasco de Puga, to Mexico, with orders to Muñoz\r\nto give up the government in three hours after he received the royal\r\ndespatch, and to return immediately to Spain for judgment of his\r\nconduct. The envoys lost no time in reaching their destination, where\r\nthey found that Muñoz had retired to the convent of Santo Domingo,\r\nprobably as a sanctuary, in order to pass Holy Week. But the impatient\r\nemissaries, responding to the joyful impatience of the people,\r\nimmediately followed him to his retreat, and, after waiting a\r\nconsiderable time in the anti-chamber, and being, at last, most\r\nhaughtily received by Muñoz, who scarcely saluted them with a nod,\r\nVillanueva drew from his breast the royal _cedula_, and commanded his\r\nsecretary to read it in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nFor a while the foiled visitador sat silent, moody and thoughtful,\r\nscarcely believing the reality of what he heard. After a pause, in\r\nwhich all parties preserved silence, he rose and declared his\r\nwillingness to yield to the king's command; and thus, this brutal\r\nchief, who but a few hours before believed himself a sovereign in\r\nMexico, was indebted to the charity of some citizens for a carriage in\r\nwhich he travelled to Vera Cruz. Here a fleet was waiting to transport\r\nhim to Spain. The late viceroy, the Marques de Falces, departed in a\r\nship of the same squadron, and, upon his arrival at the court, soon\r\nfound means to justify himself entirely in the eyes of his sovereign.\r\nBut it went harder with Muñoz. He vainly tried his skill at\r\nexculpation with the king. Philip seems to have despised him too much\r\nto enter into discussion upon the merits of the accusations. The facts\r\nwere too flagrant. The king returned him his sword, declining to hear\r\nany argument in his justification. \"I sent you to the Indies to\r\ngovern, not to destroy!\" said Philip, as he departed from his\r\npresence; and that very night the visitador suddenly expired!\r\n\r\nWhether he died of mortification or violence, is one of those state\r\nsecrets, which, like many others of a similar character, the\r\nchronicles of Spain do not reveal!\r\n\r\nDon Martin Cortéz and his family took refuge in Spain where his case\r\nwas fully examined; and whilst the investigation lasted, from 1567 to\r\n1574, his estates in Mexico were confiscated. He was finally declared\r\ninnocent of all the charges, but his valuable property had been\r\nseriously injured and wasted by the officers of the crown, to whom it\r\nwas intrusted during the long period of sequestration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Liceo Mexicano vol. 1, p. 263, et seq.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1568-1589.\r\n\r\n    ALMANZA VICEROY.--CHICHIMECAS REVOLT--JESUITS----INQUISITION.--\r\n    PESTILENCE.--NO INDIAN TRIBUTE EXACTED.--ALMANZA DEPARTS--XUARES\r\n    VICEROY.--WEAK ADMINISTRATION--INCREASE OF COMMERCE.--PEDRO MOYA\r\n    DE CONTRERAS VICEROY.--REFORMS UNDER A NEW VICEROY.--HIS POWER AS\r\n    VICEROY AND INQUISITOR.--ZUÑIGA VICEROY.--TREASURE--PIRACY.--\r\n    CAVENDISH--DRAKE CAPTURES A GALEON.

VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1568-1580.\r\n\r\nThe salutary lesson received by the Audiencia in the events which\r\noccurred in the metropolis during late years, induced its members to\r\nconduct themselves with less arrogance during the short time they held\r\nsupreme power after the departure of the Visitadores. In October of\r\n1568, a new viceroy, Don Martin Enriquez de Almanza, arrived at Vera\r\nCruz, whence he reached the capital on the 5th of the following\r\nNovember after having routed the English whom he found in possession\r\nof the Isle of Sacrificios.\r\n\r\nDon Martin immediately perceived, upon assuming the reins of\r\ngovernment, that it was necessary to calm the public mind in the\r\nmetropolis which, from recent occurrences, now began to regard all men\r\nin authority with jealousy and distrust. He let the people understand,\r\ntherefore, from the first, that he did not design to countenance any\r\nproceedings similar to those which had lately almost disorganized and\r\nrevolutionized the colony. An occasion soon presented itself in which\r\nhis prudence and discretion were required to adjust a serious dispute\r\nconcerning the Franciscan monks and in which the people sympathized\r\nwith the brotherhood and their supposed rights. Any act of rigor or\r\nharshness would have kindled the flame of sedition, but the mild\r\ndiplomacy of the viceroy sufficed to calm the litigants and to restore\r\nperfect peace to the capital. A religious dispute, in such a community\r\nas Mexico then was, seemed, indeed, an affair of no small moment,\r\nespecially when it arose in so tempestuous a period of the nation and\r\nwas the first occasion to try the temper and talents of a new viceroy.\r\n\r\nBut the attention of Don Martin was soon to be drawn from the capital\r\ntowards the frontiers of his government, where he found that the\r\ntroublesome bands of wandering Chichimecas, had been busy in their old\r\nwork of robbery and spoliation, whilst the Audiencia was engaged in\r\nits intrigues and corruption in the city of Mexico. The impunity with\r\nwhich these martial vagabonds had been allowed to proceed, increased\r\ntheir daring, and the evils they inflicted on the country were\r\nbecoming continually greater. Not satisfied with having despatched the\r\nchief alcalde of the hostile region with the militia to punish the\r\nrebels, he joined the forces of that, officer, and succeeded after\r\ngreat slaughter in compelling the Indians to quit the soil they had\r\nhitherto ravaged. It should be recorded, in justice to the viceroy,\r\nthat he ordered the Indian children who fell into the hands of his\r\nsoldiery, to be spared, and, at the end of the campaign, brought them\r\nall to the metropolis, where he distributed them among rich families\r\nso that they might receive a christian education. In order to save the\r\nregion from further devastation he established therein a colony, to\r\nwhich he gave the name of San Felipe, perhaps in honor of his king, as\r\nhe bestowed upon it the title of \"city.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things when Pedro Moya de Contreras arrived\r\nin Mexico as Inquisitor, having been sent by Philip to establish the\r\ndread tribunal of the faith in that capital. The Spanish king feared\r\nthat the doctrines of the reformation which were then rife in Europe\r\nmight find friends among his transatlantic subjects, and he mercifully\r\nresolved to give them, as a guardian of their consciences, this sad\r\nand dreadful present. In 1572, Doctor Pedro Sanchez, a Jesuit, with\r\nvarious brethren of the same order, came to the city of Mexico, and\r\nfounded a college in certain edifices which were ceded to them for\r\nthat purpose by Alonso Villaseca. The brethren of the holy office, or\r\ninquisition, meanwhile organized _their_ body, for future operations,\r\nand settled under the wings of the church of Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period, also, that Don Martin established the\r\n_alcabala_; and, although the merchants opposed the measure, which was\r\nentirely new to them, and alleged that it was a mortal blow to their\r\nbusiness, they were unable to force the viceroy to retract his\r\nmeasure. His determination was founded on the fact that trade had now\r\nbecome established on a firm and robust basis, and that it could well\r\nbear without injury an impost of this character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the years 1574 and 1575 there were serious discussions between the\r\ntemporal and spiritual powers of Mexico, growing out of a royal order\r\nthat no prelate should be admitted in the country unless he bore a\r\nsuitable license from the Council of the Indies. In 1576, Mexico was\r\nagain visited by a frightful pestilence, which spread rapidly, and\r\ncarried off large numbers of victims. The whole of New Spain was\r\nravaged by it, and neither care, nor medical science, seems to have\r\nhad the least effect either in curing or in alleviating the sufferers.\r\nThe symptoms of this malady were a violent pain in the head which was\r\nsucceeded by a burning fever, under which the patient sank. None\r\nsurvived the seventh day, and it is reported that near two millions\r\nperished under the dreadful scourge. The malady abated at the close of\r\nthe rainy season, and disappeared entirely at the beginning of 1577.\r\n\r\nIn the two succeeding years, Don Martin commanded that the usual\r\nannual tribute should not be collected from the Indians. This measure\r\nwas designed to alleviate the lot of these suffering subjects of the\r\nking and to testify the paternal regard which he cherished for a race\r\nthat served him and his subjects so beneficially in the mines. It was\r\nin the mineral districts that the Indians were in reality the greatest\r\nsufferers and laborers in New Spain. Their toil was incessant. Their\r\ntask masters gave them no respite in the bowels of the earth, for they\r\nwrought as if they designed to scrape every vein and artery of the\r\ncolony's soil. Silver and labor were calculated with exactness, and no\r\nlimit to the Indian's industry was prescribed save that which was\r\nimposed by his capacity for work and his power of endurance. The\r\nviceroy, seeking to alleviate this, introduced a milder system, as far\r\nas he was able, among the leading miners of the colony. He insisted\r\nupon permitting the Indians regular repose, and he forbade their\r\nentire confinement within the mines, but commanded that they should be\r\nallowed time to breathe the fresh air on the surface of the earth, and\r\nsuffered to attend to their own domestic labors, or to toil on public\r\nworks for a competent recompense.\r\n\r\nThe government of Don Martin had thus far been unusually calm, but his\r\nlast moments in Mexico were to be disturbed by a quarrel with a\r\nFranciscan monk, named Rivera, who had called at the palace to see\r\nthe viceroy on a matter of business for his convent, and had been\r\nforced to wait a considerable time without being finally honored with\r\nan audience. The petulant friar regarded this as a slight upon the\r\nbrotherhood, and, shortly afterwards, whilst preaching in the\r\ncathedral, declared, with a sneering and offensive purpose against the\r\nviceroy, that \"in the palace all became equal, and that no difference\r\nwas made between ecclesiastics and secular folks!\"\r\n\r\nThe viceroy could not permit so flagrant a breach of decorum and so\r\ndangerous a taunt in a popular appeal, to rest unrebuked. He therefore\r\ndemanded the punishment of the pulpit critic, and the Audiencia\r\nordered Rivera to depart forthwith for Spain. But the haughty monk in\r\norder to avoid the disgrace of expulsion, united the whole body of his\r\nfraternity in the quarrel, and singing the psalm \"In exitu Israel de\r\nÆgipto,\" they departed from the city by the road leading to Vera Cruz.\r\nThe viceroy seems to have been moved by this act of the brotherhood,\r\nand immediately wrote to Rivera in soothing terms requesting him to\r\nreturn to Mexico where justice should be done him. The Franciscan\r\nreturned, but soon after received a royal order to depart for Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1580, the abundant rain caused again an inundation of the capital,\r\nand Don Martin Enriquez was about to engage in the construction of the\r\ncelebrated canal of Huehuetoca, when he was removed to the viceroyalty\r\nof Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON LORENZO XUARES, CONDE DE LA CORUÑA, V. VICEROY OF MEXICO.\r\n1580-1583.\r\n\r\nDon Lorenzo Xuares, Conde de la Coruña, was appointed by the king,\r\nsuccessor of Almanza, and made his triumphal entry into the city of\r\nMexico on the evening of the 4th of October, 1580. The gay and affable\r\ncharacter of this personage at once attracted the people and the\r\ncolonial court; and in consequence of the rapidly increasing\r\npopulation, wealth, and luxury of New Spain, as well as from the\r\nunreserved demeanor of the viceroy, it was supposed that a golden age\r\nhad arrived in the history of Mexico, which would forever signalize\r\nthe administration of Xuares.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the viceroy was too lenient and amiable for the task that had\r\nbeen imposed on him in America. The epoch of speculation and adventure\r\nhad not yet passed by, and of course, the corruption which ever\r\nfollows in their train required still to be closely watched and\r\nquickly checked. To this duty Xuares did not immediately address\r\nhimself, and the result was that the oidores, the alcaldes, and all\r\nwho administered justice, at once put themselves up to auction and\r\nsold their services, their favors, or their decisions to the highest\r\nbidder. Disorder reigned in every department, in the year following\r\nthe arrival of Xuares; and even the royal revenues, which hitherto had\r\ngenerally remained sacred, were squandered or secreted by the persons\r\nto whose care and fidelity their collection was intrusted. The\r\nlimitations which we have already seen were placed upon a viceroy's\r\npower in the time of Velasco, now tied the hands of Xuares. He could\r\nnot dismiss or even suspend the defrauders of the revenue or the\r\npublic wretches who prostituted their official power for gold. Nor was\r\nhe, probably, unwilling to be deprived of a dangerous right which\r\nwould have placed him in direct hostility to the army of speculators\r\nand jobbers. And yet it was necessary for the preservation of the\r\ncolony that these evils should be quickly abated. In this political\r\nstrait, concealing his intentions from the viceroyal court, he applied\r\nto Philip to send a Visitador with ample powers to readjust the\r\ndisorganized realm.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of New Spain had augmented astonishingly within a few\r\nyears. Vera Cruz and Acapulco had become splendid emporiums of wealth\r\nand trade. The east and the west poured their people into Mexico\r\nthrough these cities; and, in the capital, some of the most\r\ndistinguished merchants of Europe, Asia, and Africa met every year,\r\nmidway between Spain and China, to transact business and exchange\r\nopinions upon the growing facilities of an extended commerce. Peru and\r\nMexico furnished the precious metals which were always so greedily\r\ndemanded by the east. In 1581, Philip II., in view of this state of\r\nthings in his colony, issued a royal order for the establishment in\r\nMexico for a Tribunal de Consulado,[33] though, it was not, in fact,\r\nactually put in effective operation until the year 1593, under the\r\nadministration of Velasco the Second. In the midsummer of 1582, the\r\nviceroy expired, probably of mingled anxiety and old age; and it was\r\nwell for Mexico that he passed so rapidly from a stage in whose\r\ndelicate drama, his years and his abilities altogether unfitted him to\r\nplay so conspicuous a part.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO MOYA DE CONTRERAS, ARCHBISHOP OF MEXICO, FIRST INQUISITOR\r\nAND VISITADOR, AND VI. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1583-1585.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Xuares, the Audiencia immediately assumed the\r\ndirection of the state; but the members of this august tribunal were\r\naltogether ignorant of the demand made by the late viceroy for a\r\nVisitador, until Don Pedro de Contreras, placed in their hands the\r\ndespatch from Philip, naming him for this important service.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop was a man well known in Mexico. Cold, austere, rigid in\r\nhis demeanor and principles, he was the very man to be chosen for the\r\ndangerous duty of contending with a band of rich, proud and\r\nunscrupulous officials. His sacred character as arch-prelate of\r\nMexico, was of no little use in such an exigency, for it gave him\r\nspiritual as well as temporal power over masses which might sometimes\r\nbe swayed by their conscientious dread of the church, even when they\r\ncould not be controlled by the arm of law. Besides this, he was the\r\nfirst _Inquisitor_ of Mexico, and in the dreaded mysteries of the holy\r\noffice, there was an overwhelming power before which the most daring\r\noffenders would not venture to rebel or intrigue.\r\n\r\nIt may be well imagined that the unexpected appearance of so\r\nformidable an ecclesiastic upon the state, armed with the sword as\r\nwell as the cross, was well calculated to awe the profligate\r\nofficials. The members of the Audiencia trembled when they read the\r\nroyal order, for the archbishop knew them well, and had been long\r\ncognizant, not only of their own maladministration but of the\r\nirregularities they countenanced in others.\r\n\r\nDon Pedro immediately undertook the discharge of his office, and in a\r\nfew days, heard a great number of complaints against various\r\nindividuals, but as he did not design proceeding with revengeful\r\nseverity against even the most culpable, he resolved to report his\r\nproceedings to the king, and, in the meanwhile, to retain in office\r\nall persons who performed their duties faithfully whilst he put an end\r\nto the most flagrant abuses.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Philip II. heard, in 1584, of the death of Mendoza, he\r\nadded the title and powers of viceroy to those already possessed by\r\nthe archbishop, and, with his commission as royal representative, he\r\nsent him additional authority which had never been enjoyed by any of\r\nhis predecessors. He was, thus, empowered to remove, at will, all\r\npersons from public employment, and even to expel ministers and\r\noidores, as well as to visit with severe punishments all who deserved\r\nthem. Under this ample discretion the viceroy removed some of the\r\noidores, suspended others, hanged certain royal officers who had\r\ndisgraced their trusts, and brought the tribunals of justice into\r\nperfect order. The king had proposed to bring the _dispersed Indians_\r\ninto towns and villages so as to control them more effectually, but\r\nthe viceroy, after consulting the priests who were best acquainted\r\nwith that population, deemed it best to defer the execution of the\r\nroyal order until he laid the objections to it before Philip.[34] In\r\n1585, a seminary for the Indians was established, in which they were\r\ntaught to read, write and comprehend the rudiments of the Catholic\r\nfaith. This institution was under the charge of the Jesuits, whose\r\nzeal for education has been celebrated in the history of all countries\r\ninto which this powerful and enlightened order of the priesthood has\r\npenetrated. A provincial council of American bishops, was, moreover,\r\nconvened this year in Mexico under the auspices of Contreras.\r\n\r\nNor was the viceroy eager only to correct the civil and religious\r\nabuses of the country without attending to the fiscal advantages which\r\nhe knew the king was always eager to secure from his colonies. In\r\ntestimony of his zeal he despatched, at this period, a rich fleet for\r\nSpain. It bore three millions three hundred thousand ducats in coined\r\nsilver, and one thousand one hundred marks in gold, together with a\r\nvariety of other valuable products, all of which arrived safely in port.\r\n\r\nThe power of this vigorous ruler, as viceroy, continued, however, but\r\nfor a single year. He was the scourge of officials in all classes,\r\nwhile the good men of the colony prayed heartily for the continuance\r\nof his authority; but it is probable that his rigor had excited\r\nagainst him the talents for intrigue which we have heretofore seen\r\nwere sometimes so actively and successfully employed both in Mexico\r\nand Spain. In October of 1585, his successor arrived in the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON ALVARO ENRIQUE DE ZUÑIGA, MARQUES DE VILLA MANRIQUE, VII. VICEROY\r\nOF MEXICO. 1585-1589.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Marques de Villa Manrique was not designed to\r\ninterfere with the functions of the archbishop and former viceroy\r\nContreras, as _Visitador_. He was solicited to continue his plenary\r\nexamination into the abuses of government in New Spain, and to clear\r\nthe country of all malefactors before he retired once more to the\r\ncloisters. Accordingly, Don Pedro remained in Mexico some time\r\ndischarging his duties, and it is probably owing to his presence that\r\nthe first year of the new viceroy passed off in perfect peace. But in\r\nthe succeeding year, in which the archbishop departed for Spain, his\r\ntroubles began by a serious discussion with the Franciscans, Agustins\r\nand Dominicans, in which the monks at last appealed from the viceroy\r\nto the king. Before Contreras, the visitador, left Mexico he had\r\nmanaged to change all the judges composing the tribunals of the\r\ncolony. The men he selected in their stead were all personally known\r\nto him or were appointed upon the recommendation of persons whose\r\nintegrity and capacity for judgment were unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable man died soon after his arrival in Madrid, where he\r\nhad been appointed president of the Council of the Indies. Like all\r\nreformers he went to his grave poor; but when the king learned his\r\nindigence he took upon himself the costs of sepulture, and laid his\r\ncolonial representative and bishop to the tomb in a manner befitting\r\none who had exercised so great and beneficial an influence in the\r\ntemporary reform of the New World. The sole stain upon the memory of\r\nContreras is perhaps the fact that he was an inquisitor.\r\n\r\nIn 1587, the viceroy Zuñiga despatched a large amount of treasure to\r\nSpain. Enormous sums were drained annually from the colonies for the\r\nroyal metropolis; but, in this year the fleet from Vera Cruz sailed\r\nwith eleven hundred and fifty-six marks of gold, in addition to an\r\nimmense amount of coined silver and merchandise of great value. These\r\nsums passed safely to the hands of the court; but such was not the\r\ncase with all the precious freights that left the American coasts,\r\nfor, at this period, the shores of our continent, on both oceans,\r\nbegan to swarm with pirates. The subjects of various European nations,\r\nbut especially the English, were most active in enterprises which, in\r\nthose days, were probably regarded more as privateering than as the\r\nbandit expeditions they have since been considered not only in morals\r\nbut in law. In the year before, Cavendish had taken in the Pacific, a\r\nSpanish ship, which was bound from Manilla to Acapulco, with a rich\r\ncargo of wares from China; and, in this year, it was known that Drake,\r\nanother noted adventurer, after making himself celebrated by the\r\ncapture of San Agustin, in Florida, had sailed for the Pacific ocean,\r\nwhose rich coasts, as well as the oriental traders, formed a tempting\r\nbooty for the bucanier.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the viceroy heard of this piratical sailor's approach to\r\nthe western boundary of his colony, he commanded the troops in\r\nGuadalajara to embark at Acapulco, under the orders of Doctor\r\nPalacios, in all the vessels which were then in port, and to scour the\r\nshores of America until the British marauder was captured. But, upon\r\nthe commander's arrival at Acapulco, he was informed that the\r\nfreebooter had already abandoned the west coast after sacking several\r\ntowns, and that he had not been seen or heard of any where for a long\r\nperiod. Drake, meanwhile, was in concealment among the distant and\r\nunfrequented coves of California, in such a situation, however, that\r\nhe could easily intercept the galeon, which passed every year from the\r\nPhilipines to Mexico, laden with goods and metals of considerable\r\nvalue. In due time he pounced upon his unsuspecting prey; and,\r\ncarrying her into a bay near the Cape of San Lucas, plundered her\r\nvaluable cargo, and set fire to the deserted hull. The news of this\r\nmishap soon reached the ears of Palacios, who, of course, immediately\r\nset sail after the corsair. But Drake was already far on his way to a\r\nspot of safety in which he and his companions might enjoy the fruits\r\nof their piratical adventure.\r\n\r\nThis successful attack upon a vessel of so much importance to the\r\ncolony,--for only _one_ was annually permitted to cross the\r\nPacific,--greatly troubled the people who depended upon its arrival\r\nfor their yearly supply of oriental wares. But as soon as the general\r\ncalm was gradually restored, an internal trouble arose which was well\r\nnigh proving of serious import to the viceroyalty. Zuñiga does not\r\nseem to have been contented with the jurisdiction which had hitherto\r\nbeen conceded to the viceroy, but, being anxious to extend his\r\nauthority over certain towns and villages, under the control of the\r\nAudiencia of Guadalajara, he demanded of that body the surrender of\r\ntheir dominion. The Audiencia, however, was jealous of its rights, and\r\nwould not yield to the viceroy who was equally pertinacious. The\r\ndispute ran high between the parties. Threats were used when\r\ndiplomacy failed, and at length, the disputants reached, but did not\r\npass, the verge of civil war, for, on both sides they seem to have\r\nordered out troops, who, fortunately never actually engaged in combat.\r\n\r\nThis ill judged act of the viceroy was fatal to his power. Letters and\r\npetitions were forthwith despatched to Madrid requiring and begging\r\nthe removal of a man whose rashness was near producing a civil war.\r\nThis was a charge not to be disregarded by the king, and, accordingly,\r\nwe find that a successor to Zuñiga was immediately named, and that the\r\nbishop of Tlascala was appointed visitador to examine the conduct of\r\nthe deposed viceroy.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, 1590, this prelate, who seems to have been\r\noriginally inimical to Zuñiga, and who should therefore have disdained\r\nthe office of his judge, ordered him to depart from Mexico. All the\r\nproperty of the late viceroy,--even the linen of his wife,--was\r\nsequestrated; the most harassing annoyances were constantly inflicted\r\nupon him; and, after six years, poor and worn down by unceasing\r\ntrials, he returned to Spain, where the influence of his friends at\r\ncourt procured the restoration of his property.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: This was a mercantile tribunal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The Indians alluded to in this passage were vaguely\r\ndesignated as Chichimecas, Otomics, and Mexican.

VICEROY OF\r\nNEW SPAIN. 1589-1595.\r\n\r\nLuis de Velasco, Count de Santiago, was the son of the second viceroy of\r\nNew Spain, and during the administration of his father, as well as for\r\nsome years afterwards, had resided in Mexico where he filled several\r\noffices, and especially that of corregidor of Zempoala. He was not on\r\nfriendly terms with the last viceroy, Zuñiga, for he had suddenly\r\nquitted New Spain in the same vessel that brought his predecessor to\r\nAmerica. Upon his arrival at the Spanish court he was sent as ambassador\r\nto Florence; and the exaggerated news of the supposed civil war in\r\nMexico having been received just as he returned from his mission, Philip\r\ndetermined to send him back to New Spain. This decision was, no doubt,\r\nfounded upon Velasco's intimate acquaintance with Mexico and its people,\r\nwith whom his interests had been so long bound up that he might almost\r\nbe regarded as a native of the country.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January, 1590, Velasco entered the capital with more\r\npomp and rejoicing than had ever attended the advent of previous\r\nviceroys, for the Mexicans looked upon him as a countryman. As soon as\r\nhe was seated in power his first acts demonstrated his good sense and\r\nmature judgment. His wish was to develope the country; to make not\r\nonly its mineral and agricultural resources available to Spain, but to\r\nopen the channels through which _labor_ could obtain its best rewards.\r\nHe therefore ordered the manufactories of coarse stuffs and cloths\r\nwhich had been established by Mendoza to be once more opened, after\r\nthe long period in which the Spanish mercantile influence had kept\r\nthem shut. This naturally produced an excitement among the interested\r\nforeign traders, but the viceroy firmly maintained his determination\r\nto punish severely any one who should oppose his decree.\r\n\r\nIn 1591, the troublesome Chichimecas, of whose disturbances we have\r\nalready spoken in other chapters, again manifested a desire to attack\r\nthe Spaniards. They were congregated in strongly armed bands in the\r\nneighborhood of Zacatecas, and menaced the Spanish population living\r\nin the neighborhood of the rich mines. Travellers could not pass\r\nthrough the country without a military escort. Strong garrisons had\r\nbeen placed by the government on the frontiers, and merciless war\r\ndeclared against them, but all was unavailing to stop their marauding\r\nexpeditions among the whites. In this year, however, they sent\r\ncommissioners to treat with the Spaniards in Mexico, and after\r\nconfessing that they were tired of a war which they found useless,\r\nthey consented to abstain from further molestation of the district,\r\nprovided the viceroy would agree to furnish them with a sufficiency of\r\nmeat for their support. Velasco of course consented to this demand of\r\nthe cattle stealers, and, moreover, obtained their consent to the\r\nadmission among them of a body of Tlascalans who would instruct them\r\nin a civil and christian mode of life. Four hundred families of these\r\nfaithful friends of the Mexicans were selected for this colony; and,\r\ntogether with some Franciscan friars, they settled in four bodies so\r\nas to form an equal number of colonies. One of these settlements was\r\nmade on the side of a rich mineral hill and took the name of San Luis\r\nPotosi,--the second formed San Miguel Mesqitic,--the third San\r\nAndres,--and the fourth Colotlan. Such was the origin of these towns,\r\nin which the two tribes lived for many years in perfect harmony, but\r\nwithout intermingling or losing their individuality.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt was also made, as had been done previously, to gather\r\nthe dispersed bands of Mexican and Otomi Indians into villages and\r\nsettlements, where they would gradually become accustomed to civilized\r\nlife. Velasco, like his predecessor Moya, consulted with the _curas_\r\nand the people who were best acquainted with the temper of these\r\nraces, and learned that they still opposed humane efforts for\r\ncivilization, preferring the vagabond life they had so long led and\r\nwhich had now become necessary and natural. Nevertheless he thought it\r\nhis duty to try the experiment. But the first Otomi who was reduced to\r\nthe necessity of abandoning his nomadic habits and building for\r\nhimself a regular habitation, not only destroyed his wife and\r\nchildren, but terminated his own existence by hanging. The viceroy\r\nthen suspended his operations and reported the untoward result,\r\ntogether with the opinion of his advisers, to the court of Spain.\r\n\r\nVelasco, ever anxious not only for the amelioration of the condition\r\nof the Indians, but for the embellishment of the capital which was now\r\ngrowing into considerable importance, caused the ALAMEDA OF MEXICO to\r\nbe laid out and planted in 1593, for the recreation of the citizens.\r\nThis magnificent grove, with its beautifully shaded avenues and\r\nwalks,--embellished by fountains and filled with every thing that can\r\ngive repose or comfort to the fatigued people who are anxious to steal\r\noff awhile from the toil and bustle of a large city,--still exists in\r\nMexico as an evidence of the taste and liberality of the viceroy, and\r\nwill be more particularly described, hereafter, in that portion of\r\nthis work which treats of the city of Mexico, and of the manners and\r\ncustoms of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1594, Philip the Second finding himself straitened for means to\r\ncarry on the European wars in which he was engaged, recurred to the\r\nunfortunate and unjust system of forced loans to increase his revenue.\r\nHe did not confine himself in this odious compulsory tax to the old\r\nworld which was most concerned in the result of his wars, but\r\ninstructed Velasco to impose a tribute of _four reales_ or fifty cents\r\nupon Indians, in addition to the sum they already paid his majesty.\r\nVelasco reluctantly undertook the unwelcome task; but anxious to\r\nlighten the burden upon the natives as much as possible, and, at the\r\nsame time, to foster the raising of poultry and cattle among these\r\npeople, he compounded the whole tax of a dollar which they were\r\nobliged to pay, for seven _reales_, or eighty-seven and a half cents\r\n_and one fowl_, which, at that time, was valued at a single real, or\r\ntwelve and a half cents. This, it will be perceived, was amiably\r\ndesigned by the viceroy, but became immediately the subject of gross\r\nabuse. The Indians are slowly moved either to new modes of cultivation\r\nor to new objects of care, even of the most domestic and useful\r\ncharacter. Instead of devoting themselves to the raising of poultry\r\nwith the industrious thrift that would have saved one-eighth of their\r\ntaxation or twelve and a half per cent, they allowed the time to pass\r\nwithout providing the required bird in their homesteads, so that when\r\nthe tax gatherer arrived they were forced to buy the fowl instead of\r\nselling it. This of course raised the price, and the consequence was\r\nthat the Indian was obliged often to pay two or three _reales_ more\r\nthan the original amount of the whole taxation of one dollar! It is\r\nrelated that one of the oidores who had taken eight hundred fowls,\r\nreserved two hundred for the consumption of his house, and through an\r\nagent sold the rest at three _reales_, or thirty-seven and a half\r\ncents each, by which he contrived to make a profit of two hundred per\r\ncent. Various efforts were made to remedy this shameful abuse or to\r\nrevoke the decree, but the system was found to be too profitable among\r\nthe officials, to be abandoned without a severe struggle. We are\r\nunable to discover that the viceroy, in this instance, used his\r\nauthority to restore the Indians to their original rights.\r\n\r\nIn 1595, it was determined to colonize the supposed kingdom of\r\nQuivara, which now received the name of New Mexico, but, before the\r\nexpedition could set forth under the command of Juan de Oñate, Velasco\r\nreceived a despatch informing him that he had been named viceroy of\r\nPeru, and that his successor Don Gaspar de Zuñiga Acebedo, Conde de\r\nMonterey, would soon appear in the colonial metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON GASPAR DE ZUÑIGA ACEBEDO, CONDE DE MONTEREY, IX. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1595-1603.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Monterey arrived at San Juan de Ulua on the 18th of\r\nSeptember, 1595, and on the 5th of the following November, entered the\r\ncapital as viceroy. At first he exhibited a cold and apathetic temper,\r\nand appeared to take but little interest in the affairs of the\r\ngovernment; but it is supposed, that being a prudent and cautious man,\r\nhe was in no haste to undertake the direction of affairs whilst he was\r\naltogether unacquainted both with the temper of the people and the\r\nnature of their institutions. An early measure, however, of his\r\nadministration deserves to be recorded and remembered. He found the\r\nIndians still suffering and complaining under the odious fowl tax,\r\ncreated by his predecessor for the protection of domestic industry,\r\nbut which had been perverted for the selfish and avaricious purposes\r\nof the receivers. He immediately abolished this impost, and diminished\r\nthe whole amount of taxation upon the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the loss of the galeon from the Philipines, which we\r\nhave related, the king ordered an expedition, under the command of\r\nGeneral Sebastian Viscaino, to examine and scour the coasts of the\r\nCalifornias, where it was alleged the precious metals, and, especially,\r\nthe most valuable pearls would be found in abundance. Viscaino recruited\r\na large number of followers in Mexico for this enterprise, and set sail\r\nwith three vessels, in 1596, from Acapulco. The adventurers coasted the\r\nterritory for a considerable time without finding a suitable location in\r\nwhich they might settle advantageously, until, at length, they\r\ndisembarked in the port of La Paz, whence, however, they soon departed\r\nfor want of provisions and supplies of every kind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Count of Monterey examined into the state of the\r\nexpedition to New Mexico, which he found had been projected and partly\r\nprepared by his predecessor. He made some changes in the plan agreed\r\non between Velasco and Oñate, and, in order to exhibit his good will\r\nto the latter personage, he joined with him, in the enterprise, his\r\nrelation Vicente Saldivar, who had gathered a number of emigrants for\r\nthese remote and northern regions. People were tempted to abandon\r\ntheir homes by the reports of extraordinary mineral wealth which was\r\nto be obtained in these unexplored portions of New Spain; and,\r\naccordingly, when the standard of the expedition was raised in the\r\ngreat square of the capital, crowds of men with their families flocked\r\naround it to enlist for the hazardous and toilsome service.\r\n\r\nThe first news received from the emigrant colonists, when they reached\r\nCaxco, two hundred leagues from the capital, was disastrous. Quarrels\r\nhad originated among the adventurers, who asserted that the terms of\r\nthe expedition had not been complied with faithfully. As soon as the\r\nviceroy heard of the discontent, he despatched Don Lope de Ulloa as a\r\npacificator, to the inflamed band which was quickly reduced to harmony\r\nand persuaded to continue its journey to the promised land. At length\r\nthe weary emigrants reached the boasted El Dorado; but finding the\r\nreports of mineral wealth altogether exaggerated, and doubting the\r\nadvantage of residing with their families permanently in such distant\r\noutposts, many of them retraced their way southward to regions that\r\nwere more densely populated.\r\n\r\nIn 1598, another effort was resolved on to gather the dispersed and\r\nrefractory vagabond Indians who wandered about the territory under the\r\nname of Mexicans and Otomies. Whilst they maintained their perfectly\r\nnomadic state it was evident that they were useless either as\r\nproductive laborers for the Spaniards, or as objects of taxation for\r\nthe sovereign. It was a wise policy, therefore, to attempt what was\r\nphilanthropically called--their civilization;--but upon this occasion,\r\nas upon all the others that preceded it, the failure was signal.\r\nCommissioners and notaries were selected and large salaries paid these\r\nofficials to ensure their faithful services in congregating the\r\ndispersed natives. But the government agents, who well knew the\r\ndifficulty if not the absolute impossibility of achieving the desired\r\nobject, amused themselves by receiving and spending the liberal\r\nsalaries disbursed by the government, whilst the Indians still\r\ncontinued as uncontrolled as ever. The Count of Monterey was\r\nnevertheless obstinately bent on the prosecution of this favorite\r\npolicy of the king, and squandered, upon these vile ministerial\r\nagents, upwards of two hundred thousand dollars, without producing the\r\nleast beneficial result. In the following viceroy's reign he was\r\nsentenced to pay the government this large sum as having been unwisely\r\nspent; but was finally absolved from its discharge by the court to\r\nwhich he appealed from the decision of his successor.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1599, the news was received in Mexico of the death\r\nof Philip II. and of the accession of Philip III. This event was\r\nperhaps the most remarkable in the annals of the colony, during the\r\nlast year of the sixteenth century, except that the town of Monterey\r\nin New Leon was founded, and that a change was made by the viceroy of\r\nthe port of Vera Cruz from its former sickly site at la Antigua, to\r\none which has since become equally unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThe first three years of the seventeenth century were chiefly\r\ncharacterized by renewed viceroyal efforts among the Indians. The\r\nproject of congregating the nomadic natives was abandoned, and various\r\nattempts were made to break up the system of _repartimientos_, which\r\nhad been, as we have seen, the established policy of the colony if not\r\nof the king, ever since the conquest. If the Indians were abandoned to\r\ntheir own free will, it was supposed that their habits were naturally\r\nso thriftless that they would become burthensome instead of beneficial\r\nto the Spanish colonists, and, ultimately, might resolve themselves\r\ninto mere wanderers like the Otomies and their vagabond companions.\r\nYet, it was acknowledged that their involuntary servitude, and the\r\ndisastrous train of impositions it entailed, were unchristian and\r\nunjust. There was a dilemma, in fact between idleness and tyranny; but\r\nthe viceroy conceived it his duty to endeavor once more, with an\r\nhonest zeal, to sustain the humane policy of freedom which was\r\nrecommended not only by the sovereign but by the religious orders who\r\nwere supposed to know the natives best. Various projects were adopted\r\nto harmonize their freedom with a _necessary_ degree of labor, in\r\norder to ensure them wages and support, whilst they were preserved\r\ntogether in organized societies. After the _repartimientos_ were\r\nabrogated, the Indians were compelled to assemble, on every Sabbath,\r\nin the public squares of the villages and towns, where they made their\r\ncontracts of service by the day. The viceroy himself, anxious to\r\nprevent fraud, assisted personally in the reunions at the plazas or\r\nsquares of San Juan and Santiago. But it was all in vain. The\r\nproprietors, land owners, and agents, were opposed to the scheme.\r\nBrokers interposed, and, after hiring the Indians at moderate rates in\r\ncontracts made with themselves, sub-let them to others on higher\r\nterms. And, at last, it is alleged that the unfortunate natives,\r\nseeing the bad operation of the viceroy's kind intentions in their\r\nbehalf, and finding their condition less happy when they had to take\r\ncare of themselves than when they were taken care of, appealed to the\r\nCount of Monterey to restore the old system of _repartimientos_ under\r\nwhich they were at least spared the trouble of seeking for\r\ntask-masters and support. Indolent by nature; creatures of habit; and\r\nliving in a country whose bosom afforded them spontaneously most of\r\nthe luxuries required by such a class, they submitted to what, in\r\nfact, was the greatest evil of their lot, because it relieved them of\r\nthe trouble of individual _effort_!\r\n\r\nIn 1602, Philip III. commanded another expedition for the colonization\r\nand exploration of the Californias. It departed in three ships and a\r\nbarque from Acapulco, on the fifth of May, under the command of\r\nViscaino. Torribio Gomez Corban was the admiral of the little fleet,\r\nand Antonio Flores, pilot. From the day of its departure, it was\r\ndriven by severe gales, but, at length, the port of Monterey was\r\nreached by the weary crews, who continued along the coast until they\r\narrived at Cape Blanco de San Sabastian, somewhat beyond Cape\r\nMendozino. There the voyagers were sorely attacked with scurvy which\r\nthinned their numbers to such an extent, that, of the whole, only six\r\nwere able to do duty. With this scant equipment of men, the vessels\r\nreached Mazatlan, where the crews recruited their health; and, passing\r\nthence to Acapulco, the expedition once more landed in the midst of\r\ncivilization and hastened back to the capital to give a bad report of\r\nthe country which in our day and generation has become the El Dorado\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe Conde de Monterey, was transferred to the viceroyalty of Peru in\r\n1603, and left the capital amid the general grief of a society whose\r\ncordial esteem he seems to have won and retained during his whole\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN DE MENDOZA Y LUNA, MARQUES DE MONTESCLAROS, X. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1603-1607.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Marques de Montesclaros to the viceroyalty of New\r\nSpain was distinguished by an unusual degree of tranquillity\r\nthroughout the colony. During the preceding administrations most of\r\nthe subjects of internal discontent were set at rest, and the\r\naborigines who had been subjected to the yoke were now becoming\r\naccustomed to bear it. In 1604, the abundant rains in the valley of\r\nMexico during the month of August, caused an inundation which greatly\r\nalarmed the population. The city and adjacent country were laid under\r\nwater, and such was the general distress that the Marques solicited\r\nthe opinions of skilful persons in regard to the canal of Huehuetoca,\r\nwhich had heretofore been spoken of as the only means of freeing the\r\ncapital from destruction by the swollen flood of the lakes. The\r\nreports made to him, however, represented the enterprise as one of\r\nimmense labor and expense, as well as requiring a great length of time\r\nfor its completion. He therefore abandoned the project for the\r\npresent, and merely repaired the _albarrada_ or dyke which Velasco had\r\nalready constructed. In addition to this precautionary measure he\r\ncaused the _calzadas_, or raised turnpikes of Guadalupe and San\r\nCristoval to be constructed, which, whilst they led to the open\r\ncountry beyond the city, served, also, as additional barriers against\r\nthe waters. After the completion of these highways, he next directed\r\nhis attention to those of San Antonio and Chapultepec, which were\r\nquickly finished, and merited the name of \"Roman works,\" for the\r\nmassive strength and durability of their construction. Various other\r\nuseful municipal works, such as aqueducts and sewers, engaged the\r\nnotice of the viceroy until, in 1607; and after the proclamation of\r\nthe Prince of Asturias (Philip IV.) by order of the king, he was\r\nordered to pass from Mexico to Peru where he was charged with the\r\nduties of the viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1607-1621.\r\n\r\n    SECOND ADMINISTRATION OF DON LUIS VELASCO--HIS GREAT WORK FOR THE\r\n    DRAINAGE OF THE VALLEY.--LAKES IN THE VALLEY--DANGER OF\r\n    INUNDATION.--HISTORY OF THE DESAGUE OF HUEHUETOCA.--OPERATIONS OF\r\n    THE ENGINEERS MARTINEZ AND BOOT.--THE FRANCISCANS.--COMPLETION OF\r\n    THE DESAGUE.--LA OBRA DEL CONSULADO.--NEGRO REVOLT.--EXTENSION OF\r\n    ORIENTAL TRADE.--GUERRA VICEROY.--DE CORDOVA VICEROY.--INDIAN\r\n    REVOLT.--CORDOVA FOUNDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON LUIS VELASCO,--THE SECOND,--CONDE DE SANTIAGO AND FIRST MARQUES DE\r\nSALINAS, XI. VICEROY OF MEXICO. HIS SECOND ADMINISTRATION. 1607-1611.\r\n\r\nDon Luis Velasco had been seven years viceroy of Peru since he left\r\nthe government of Mexico, when he was summoned once more to rule a\r\ncountry of which he felt himself almost a native.[35] He was tired of\r\npublic life, and being advanced in years would gladly have devoted the\r\nrest of his existence to the care of his family and the management of\r\nhis valuable estates in the colony. But he could not refuse the\r\nnomination of the king, and at the age of seventy, once more found\r\nhimself at the head of affairs in New Spain.\r\n\r\nThe government of this excellent nobleman has been signalized in\r\nhistory by the erection of the magnificent public work, designed for\r\nthe drainage of the valley, of which we spoke during the last\r\nviceroyalty. The results of Velasco's labors were permanent, and as\r\nhis work, or at least a large portion of it remains to the present\r\nday, and serves to secure the capital from the floods with which it is\r\nconstantly menaced, we shall describe the whole of this magnificent\r\nenterprise at present, though our description will carry us,\r\nchronologically, out of the period under consideration, and lead us\r\nfrom the seventeenth to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Mexico is a great basin, which although seven thousand\r\nfive hundred feet above the level of the sea, and of course subject to\r\nconstant and rapid evaporation, is yet exceedingly humid for so elevated\r\na region. No stream, except the small _arroyo_, or rivulet of\r\nTequisquiac, issues from the valley, whilst the rivers Papalotla,\r\nTezcoco, Teotihuacan, Guadalupe, Pachuca and Guautitlan pour into it and\r\nform the five lakes of Chalco, Xochimilco, Tezcoco, San Cristoval and\r\nZumpango. \"These lakes rise by stages as they approach the northern\r\nextremity of the valley; the waters of Tezcoco, being, in their ordinary\r\nstate, four Mexican varas and eight inches lower than the waters of the\r\nlake of San Cristoval, which again, are six varas lower than the waters\r\nof the lake Zumpango, which forms the northernmost link of this\r\ndangerous chain. The level of Mexico in 1803 was exactly one vara, one\r\nfoot and one inch above that of the lake of Tezcoco,[36] and,\r\nconsequently, was nine varas and five inches lower than that of the lake\r\nof Zumpango; a disproportion, the effects of which have been more\r\nseverely felt because the lake of Zumpango receives the tributary\r\nstreams of the river Guautitlan, whose volume is more considerable than\r\nthat of all the other rivers which enter the valley combined.\r\n\r\n\"In the inundations to which this peculiarity in the formation of the\r\nvalley of Mexico has given rise, a similar succession of events has\r\nbeen always observed. The lake of Zumpango, swollen by the rapid\r\nincrease of the river Guautitlan during the rainy season, forms a\r\njunction with that of San Cristoval, and the waters of the two\r\ncombined burst the dykes which separate them from the lake of Tezcoco.\r\nThe waters of this last again, raised suddenly more than a vara above\r\ntheir usual level, and prevented from extending themselves to the east\r\nand south-east, by the rapid rise of the ground in that direction,\r\nrush back towards the capital and fill the streets which approach\r\nnearest to their own level. This was the case in the years 1553, 1580,\r\n1604 and 1607, in each of which years the capital was entirely under\r\nwater, and the dykes which had been constructed for its protection\r\ndestroyed.\"[37]\r\n\r\nSuch is a topographical sketch of the country accurately given by a\r\ncareful writer; and to protect an important region so constantly\r\nmenaced with inundation, the viceroy now addressed himself.\r\nAccordingly he commissioned the engineer Enrique Martinez, in 1607 to\r\nattempt the drainage of the lake of Zumpango, by the stupendous canal\r\nnow known under the name of the DESAGUE DE HUEHUETOCA.\r\n\r\n\"The plan of Martinez appears to have embraced two distinct objects,\r\nthe first of which extended to the lakes of Tezcoco and San Cristoval,\r\nwhile the second was confined to the lake of Zumpango whose\r\nsuperfluous waters were to be carried into the valley of Tula by a\r\nsubterraneous canal into which the river Guautitlan was likewise\r\ncompelled to flow. The second of these projects only was approved by\r\nthe government; and the line of the canal having been traced by\r\nMartinez between the Cerro or hill of Sincoque and the hill of\r\nNochistongo to the north-west of Huehuetoca, where the mountains that\r\nsurrounded the valley are less elevated than in any other spot,--the\r\ngreat subterraneous gallery of Nochistongo was commenced on the 28th\r\nof November, 1607. Fifteen thousand Indians were employed in this\r\nwork, and as a number of air shafts were sunk, in order to enable them\r\nto work upon the different points at once, in eleven months a tunnel\r\nof six thousand six hundred metres[38] in length, three metres five in\r\nbreadth and four metres two in height, was concluded.\r\n\r\n\"From the northern extremity of this tunnel called la boca de San\r\nGregorio, an open cut of eight thousand six hundred metres conducted\r\nthe waters to the _salto_ or fall of the river Tula, where, quitting\r\nthe valley of Mexico, they precipitate themselves into that of Tula,\r\nfrom a natural terrace of twenty Mexican varas in height, and take\r\ntheir course towards the bar of Tampico where they enter the gulf of\r\nMexico. An enterprise of such magnitude could hardly be free from\r\ndefects, and Martinez soon discovered that the unbaked bricks, of\r\nwhich the interior of the tunnel was composed, were unable to resist\r\nthe action of water, which, being confined within narrow limits, was\r\nat times impelled through the tunnel with irresistible violence. A\r\nfacing of wood proved equally ineffectual, and masonry was at last\r\nresorted to; but even this, though successful for a time, did not\r\nanswer permanently, because the engineer, instead of an elliptical\r\narch, constructed nothing but a sort of vault, the sides of which\r\nrested upon a foundation of no solidity. The consequence was that the\r\nwalls were gradually undermined by the water, and that the vault\r\nitself in many parts fell in.\r\n\r\n\"This accident rendered the government indifferent to the fate of the\r\ngallery which was neglected, and finally abandoned in the year 1623,\r\nwhen a Dutch engineer, named Adrian Boot, induced the viceroy to\r\nresume the old system of dyke and embankments, and to give orders for\r\nclosing the tunnel of Nochistongo. A sudden rise in the lake of\r\nTezcoco caused these orders to be revoked, and Martinez was again\r\nallowed to proceed with his works which he continued until the 20th of\r\nJune, 1629, when an event took place, the real causes of which have\r\nnever been ascertained.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rainy season having set in with unusual violence, Martinez,\r\neither desirous to convince the inhabitants of the capital of the\r\nutility of his gallery, or fearful, as he himself stated, that the\r\nfruits of his labor would be destroyed by the entrance of too great a\r\nvolume of water, closed the mouth of the tunnel, without communicating\r\nto any one his intention to do so. The effect was instantaneous; and,\r\nin one night, the whole town of Mexico was laid under water, with the\r\nexception of the great square, and one of the suburbs. In all the\r\nother streets the water rose upwards of three feet, and during five\r\nyears, from 1629 to 1634, canoes formed the only medium of\r\ncommunication between them. The foundations of many of the principal\r\nhouses were destroyed; trade was paralyzed; the lower classes reduced\r\nto the lowest state of misery; and orders were actually given by the\r\ncourt of Madrid to abandon the town and build a new capital in the\r\nelevated plains between Tacuba and Tacubaya, to which the waters of\r\nthe lakes, even before the conquest, had never been known to extend.\r\n\r\n\"The necessity of this measure was obviated by a succession of\r\nearthquakes in the dry year of 1634, when the valley was cracked and\r\nrent in various directions, and the waters gradually disappeared; a\r\nmiracle for which due credit should be given to the Virgin of Guadalupe,\r\nby whose powerful intercession it is said to have been effected.\r\n\r\n\"Martinez, who had been thrown into confinement in 1629, was released\r\nupon the termination of the evils which his imprudence was said to\r\nhave occasioned; and was again placed by a new viceroy,--the Marques\r\nde Cerralvo,--at the head of the works by which similar visitations\r\nwere to be averted in future. Under his superintendence the great\r\ndyke, or _Calzada_ of San Cristoval was put in order,[39] by which the\r\nlake of that name is divided from that of Tezcoco. This gigantic work\r\nwhich consists of two distinct masses, the first, one league, and the\r\nsecond, one thousand five hundred varas in length, is ten varas in\r\nwidth or thickness throughout, and from three and a half to four\r\nvaras in height. It is composed entirely of stone, with buttresses of\r\nsolid masonry on both sides, and three sluices, by which, in any\r\nemergency, a communication between the lakes can be effected and\r\nregulated at the same time. The whole was concluded, like the gallery\r\nof Nochistongo, in eleven months, although as many years would now be\r\nrequired for such an undertaking. But in those days the sacrifice of\r\nlife, and particularly of Indian life, in public works, was not\r\nregarded. Many thousands of the natives perished before the _desague_\r\nwas completed; and to their loss, as well as to the hardships endured\r\nby the survivors, may be ascribed the horror with which the name of\r\nHuehuetoca is pronounced by their descendants.\r\n\r\n\"It is not our intention to follow the progress of the canal of\r\nHuehuetoca through all the various changes which occurred in the plans\r\npursued with respect to it from 1637, when the direction of the work\r\nwas again taken from Martinez and confided to the Franciscan monks,\r\nuntil 1767, when, under the viceroyalty of the Marques de Croix, the\r\nConsulado or corporate body of Mexican merchants, engaged to complete\r\nthis great national undertaking. The necessity of converting the\r\ntunnel of Martinez into an open cut, had long been acknowledged, it\r\nhaving been found impossible to prevent the tunnel from being\r\ncontinually choked up by the sand and rubbish deposited by the water\r\non its passage; but as the work was only prosecuted with vigor when\r\nthe danger of an inundation became imminent, and was almost suspended\r\nin the dry years, two thousand three hundred and ten varas of the\r\nnorthern gallery remained untouched, after the expiration of one\r\nhundred and thirty years when the Consulado was intrusted with the\r\ncompletion of the arduous task. As the old line of the gallery was to\r\nbe preserved, it became necessary to give the cut which was to be\r\nsunk, perpendicularly upon it, an enormous width at the top, in order\r\nto prevent the sides from falling in; and in the more elevated parts,\r\nbetween the mountains of Sincoque and the hill of Nochistongo, for the\r\nspace of two thousand six hundred and twenty-four feet, the width,\r\nacross, varies from two hundred and seventy-eight to six hundred and\r\nthirty feet, while the perpendicular depth is from one hundred and\r\nforty-seven to one hundred and ninety-six feet. The whole length of\r\nthe cut from the sluice called the _vertideros_ to the _salto_ or fall\r\nof the river Tula, is sixty-seven thousand five hundred and\r\nthirty-seven feet or twenty-four thousand five hundred and thirty\r\nMexican varas. The highest point of the hill of Nochistongo is that\r\ncalled Boveda Real, and it would be difficult when looking down from\r\nit, upon the stream below, and, following with the eye the vast\r\nopening through which it seeks an issue, to conceive that the whole\r\nis, indeed, the work of man, did not the mounds on either side, as yet\r\nbut imperfectly covered with vegetation, and the regular outline of\r\nthe terraces, denote both the recentness of its completion, and the\r\nimpossibility of attributing it to any natural convulsion.\r\n\r\n\"The Obra del Consulado, as the opening cut is called, was concluded\r\nin the year 1789. It cost nearly a million of dollars; and the whole\r\nexpense of the drainage from 1607 to the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, including the various projects commenced and abandoned when\r\nonly partially executed,--the dykes connected with the _desague_,--and\r\nthe two canals which communicate with the lakes of San Cristoval and\r\nZumpango,--is estimated at six millions two hundred and forty-seven\r\nthousand six hundred and seventy dollars, or one million two hundred\r\nand forty-nine thousand five hundred and thirty-four pounds. It is\r\nsupposed that one-third of this sum would have proved sufficient to\r\ncover all the expenses, had Martinez been furnished in the first\r\ninstance with the means of executing his project upon the scale which\r\nhe had judged necessary; for it is in the reduced dimensions of the\r\ngallery of Nochistongo, which was never equal to the volume of water\r\nto which at particular seasons it afforded an outlet, that all the\r\nsubsequent expenditure has originated.\"[40]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have judged it better to group together in this place all the facts\r\nrelative to this most important national work,--so as to afford the\r\nreader a complete picture of the undertaking,--than to relate the slow\r\nand tedious history of the work as it advanced to completion during the\r\nreigns of many viceroys. The present condition of the _desague_ and its\r\nadvantages will be treated in another portion of this work; and we shall\r\ntherefore revert at once to the year 1609, in which a large number of\r\nnegroes rebelled against the Spaniards. It seems that the blacks in the\r\nneighborhood of Cordova, who were in fact slaves on many of the\r\n_hiciendas_ or plantations, having been treated, in an inhuman manner by\r\ntheir owners, rose against them in great force, and gathering together\r\nin the adjacent mountains menaced their tyrannical task-masters with\r\ndeath, and their property with ruin. Velasco sent one hundred soldiers,\r\none hundred volunteers, one hundred Indian archers, together with two\r\nhundred Spaniards and Mestizos, to attack them in their fastnesses.\r\nSeveral skirmishes took place between the slaves and these forces, and\r\nat length the negroes yielded to the Spaniards,--craving their pardon,\r\ninasmuch as their \"insurrection was not against the king,\"--and\r\npromising that they would no longer afford a refuge to the blacks who\r\nabsconded from the plantations. Velasco at once granted their request,\r\nand permitted them to settle in the town of San Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nIn 1610 and 1611, there were but few important incidents in the\r\nhistory of New Spain, which was now gradually forming itself into a\r\nregularly organized state, free from all those violent internal\r\ncommotions, which nations, like men, are forced to undergo in their\r\ninfancy. The viceroy still endeavored to ameliorate the condition of\r\nthe Indians, and despatched a mission to Japan in order to extend the\r\noriental commerce of Spain. The true policy of Castile would have\r\nbeen, instead of crushing Mexico by colonial restrictions, to have\r\nraised her gradually into a gigantic state, which, situated in the\r\ncentre of America, on the narrowest part of the continent between the\r\ntwo oceans, and holding in her veins the precious metals in\r\nexhaustless quantities, would have surely grasped and held the\r\ncommerce of the east and of Europe. Such would seem the natural\r\ndestiny of Mexico if we examine her geographical features carefully;\r\nnor do we venture too much in predicting that the time will come when\r\nthat destiny will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nVelasco was now well stricken in years and required repose. His\r\nmaster, appreciating his faithful services and his unquestionable\r\nloyalty, added to his already well earned titles that of Marques of\r\nSalinas, and creating him president of the Council of the Indies\r\nrecalled him to Spain where he could pass in quiet the evening of his\r\ndays, whilst he was also enabled to impart the results of his vast\r\nAmerican experience to the king and court.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAY GARCIA GUERRA, ARCHBISHOP OF MEXICO, XII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.\r\n1611-1612.\r\n\r\nVelasco, as an especial mark of royal favor, was desired to retain his\r\npower as viceroy until the moment of embarkation for Spain, and then\r\nto depose it in favor of the monk Garcia Guerra, who had been the\r\nworthy prior of a Dominican convent at Burgos in Spain, until he was\r\nnominated to the Archepiscopal See of Mexico. His government was brief\r\nand altogether eventless. He became viceroy on the 17th of June, 1611,\r\nand died on the 22d of February in the following year, of a wound he\r\nreceived in falling as he descended from his coach.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO FERNANDEZ DE CORDOVA, MARQUES DE GUADALCAZAR, XIII. VICEROY\r\nOF NEW SPAIN. 1612-1621.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the last viceroy, the Audiencia, of course, took\r\npossession of the government during the interregnum;--and, as it seems\r\nthat this body of men was always doomed to celebrate its authority by\r\nacts of folly or cruelty, we find that soon after its accession to\r\npower the city was alarmed by the news of another outbreak among the\r\nnegroes. The people were panic struck. A terrible noise had been heard\r\nin the streets of the metropolis during the night, and, although it\r\nwas proved that the disturbance was entirely caused by the entrance,\r\nduring the darkness, of a large drove of hogs, the Audiencia\r\ndetermined, nevertheless, to appease public opinion by the execution\r\nof twenty-nine male negroes and four negro women! Their withered and\r\nfetid bodies were left to hang on the gallows, tainting the air and\r\nshocking the eyes of every passer, until the neighborhood could no\r\nlonger bear the sickly stench and imperiously demanded their removal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Marques de Guadalcazar took possession of the viceroyalty on the\r\n28th of October, 1612, and his government passed in quiet engaged in the\r\nmere ordinary discharge of executive duties during the first four years,\r\nsubsequent to which an Indian insurrection of a formidable character\r\nbroke out in one of the departments, under a chief who styled himself\r\n\"Son of the Sun and God of Heaven and Earth.\" This assault was fatal to\r\nevery Spaniard within reach of the infuriate natives, who broke into the\r\nchurches, murdered the whites seeking sanctuary at their altars, and\r\nspared not even the ecclesiastics, who, in all times, have so zealously\r\nproved themselves to be the defenders of their race. Don Gaspar Alvear,\r\nGovernor of Durango, assembled a large force as soon as the viceroy\r\ninformed him of the insurrection, and marched against the savages. After\r\nthree months of fighting, executions and diplomacy, this functionary\r\nsucceeded in suffocating the rebellion; but he was probably more\r\nindebted, for the final reconciliation of the Indians, to the persuasive\r\ntalents of the Jesuits who accompanied the expedition, than to the arms\r\nof his soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe remaining years of this viceroyalty are only signalized by the\r\nfounding of the city of Cordova,--whose neighborhood is renowned for\r\nthe excellent tobacco it produces,--and for the construction of the\r\nbeautiful aqueduct of San Cosmé which brings the sweet waters of Santa\r\nFé to the capital. This monument to the intelligence and memory of\r\nGuadalcazar was completed in 1620; and, in March, 1621, the viceroy\r\nwas removed to the government of Peru.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Velasco had been sent to Peru eleven years before, and\r\nafter governing it seven, had returned to reside in Mexico, when he\r\nwas unexpectedly reappointed viceroy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: The level of Tezcoco is now, according to Mühlenpfordt,\r\nfive feet seven inches (Spanish) below that of the city of Mexico.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Ward's Mexico in 1827, vol. 2, p. 282 et seq.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The metre is equal to thirty-nine thousand three hundred\r\nand seventy-one English inches.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: The Calzada of San Cristoval was originally erected,\r\naccording to good authority, in the year 1605.

VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1621-1624.\r\n\r\nUpon the removal of the Marques of Guadalcazar, and until the 21st of\r\nSeptember, 1621, the Audiencia again ruled in Mexico, without any\r\ninterruption however, upon this occasion, of the public peace. The six\r\nmonths of the interregnum might, indeed, have been altogether\r\nforgotten, in the history of the country, had not the Audiencia been\r\nobliged to announce the reception of a royal _cedula_ from Philip IV.,\r\ncommunicating the news of his father's death, and commanding a\r\nnational mourning for his memory. In September, the new viceroy\r\narrived in the capital, and immediately caused the royal order to be\r\ncarried into effect and allegiance to be sworn solemnly to Philip IV.\r\nas king and lord of Old and New Spain.[41]\r\n\r\nThe Marques de Gelves was selected by the sovereign for the reputation\r\nhe bore in Spain as a lover of justice and order,--qualities which\r\nwould ensure his utility in a country whose quietness, during several\r\nof the last viceroyal reigns, had indicated either a very good or a\r\nvery bad government, which it was impossible for the king to examine\r\npersonally. Accordingly Gelves took the reins with a firm hand. He\r\nfound many of the departments of government in a bad condition, and is\r\nsaid to have reformed certain abuses which were gradually undermining\r\nthe political and social structure of the colony. In these duties the\r\ntwo first years of his viceroyalty passed away quietly; but Gelves,\r\nthough an excellent magistrate so far as the internal police of the\r\ncountry is concerned, was, nevertheless, a selfish and avaricious\r\nperson, and seems to have resolved that his fortune should prosper by\r\nhis government of New Spain.\r\n\r\nThe incidents which we are about to relate are stated on the authority\r\nof Father Gage, an English friar who visited Mexico in 1625; and whose\r\npictures of the manners of the people correspond so well with our\r\npersonal knowledge of them, at present, that we are scarcely at\r\nliberty to question his fidelity as a historian.[42]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1624, Mexico was, for a time, in a state of great\r\ndistraction, and well nigh revolted from the Spanish throne. The\r\npassion for acquiring fortune, which had manifested itself somewhat in\r\nother viceroys, seems in Gelves unbounded. He resolved to achieve his\r\nend by a bold stroke; and, in 1623, having determined to monopolize\r\nthe staff of life among the Indians and creoles, he despatched one of\r\nthe wealthiest Mexicans, Don Pedro de Mexia, to buy up corn in all the\r\nprovinces at the rate of fourteen reales, the sum fixed by law at\r\nwhich the corn was sold in times of famine. The farmers, who, of\r\ncourse, knew nothing of Mexia's plan readily disposed of their corn,\r\nwith which the artful purveyor filled his store houses all over the\r\ncountry. After the remnant of the crop was brought to market and sold,\r\nmen began to compare notes, and suddenly discovered that corn was no\r\nwhere to be procured, save from the granaries of Mexia. \"The poor\r\nbegan to murmur, the rich began to complain; and the tariff of\r\nfourteen reales was demanded from the viceroy.\" But he, the secret\r\naccomplice of Mexia, decided, that as the crops had been plentiful\r\nduring the year, it could not be regarded as one of scarcity according\r\nto the evident intention of the law, so that it would be unfair to\r\nreduce the price of grain to that of famine. And thus the people,\r\nbalked in their effort to obtain justice from their ruler, though\r\nsuffering from extreme imposition, resolved to bear the oppression,\r\nrather than resort to violence for redress.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, however, the intimacy between Gelves and Mexia became\r\nmore apparent as the confederates supposed they had less cause for\r\nconcealment; and the poor, again, besought the viceroy for justice and\r\nthe legal tariff. But the temptation was too great for the avaricious\r\nrepresentative of the king. He again denied their petition; and, then,\r\nas a last hope, they resorted to a higher power, which, in such\r\nconflicts with their rulers, had usually been successful.\r\n\r\nIn those days, Don Alonzo de la Serna, a man of lofty character and\r\nintrepid spirit, was archbishop of Mexico, and perceiving the\r\navaricious trick of the viceroy and his pimp, threw himself on the\r\npopular side and promptly excommunicated Mexia. But the sturdy\r\nmerchant, protected by viceroyal authority, was not to be conquered by\r\nso immaterial a thing as a prelate's curse placarded on the door of a\r\ncathedral. He remained quietly ensconced in his house, despatched\r\norders to his agents, and even _raised_ the price of his extravagant\r\nbread stuffs. For a moment, perhaps, De la Serna was confounded by\r\nthis rebellious son of the church, yet the act convinced him, if\r\nindeed, he entertained any doubt on the subject, that Mexia was backed\r\nby the viceroy, and, consequently, that any further attempts would\r\nbring him in direct conflict with the government. Nevertheless, a man\r\nlike him was not to be easily alarmed or forced to retreat so quickly.\r\nThe church, supreme in spiritual power, would never yield, especially\r\nin a matter of popular and vital concern, and the archbishop,\r\ntherefore, determined to adopt the severest method at once, and by an\r\norder of _cessatio divinis_, to stop, immediately, all religious\r\nworship throughout the colony. This was a direful interdict, the\r\npotency of which can only be imagined by those who have lived in\r\nCatholic countries whose piety is not periodically regulated upon the\r\nprinciple of a seven day clock, but where worship is celebrated from\r\nhour to hour in the churches. The doors of chapels, cathedrals and\r\nreligious buildings were firmly closed. A death-like silence prevailed\r\nover the land. No familiar bells sounded for matins or vespers. The\r\npeople, usually warned by them of their hours of labor or repose, had\r\nnow no means of measuring time. The priests went from house to house,\r\nlamenting the grievous affliction with which the country was visited\r\nand sympathizing cordially with the people. The church mourned for the\r\nunnatural pains her rebellious son had brought upon her patient\r\nchildren. But still the contumacious Mexia sold his corn and exacted\r\nhis price!\r\n\r\nAt length, however, popular discontent became so clamorous, that even\r\namong this orderly and enduring people, the life of the viceroy's\r\nagent was no longer safe. He retreated therefore from his own dwelling\r\nto the palace, which was strongly guarded, and demanded protection\r\nfrom Gelves. The viceroy admitted him and took issue with the\r\narchbishop. He immediately sent orders to the priests and curates of\r\nthe several parishes, to cause the orders of interdict and\r\nexcommunication to be torn from the church walls, and all the chapels\r\nto be thrown open for service. But the resolute clergy, firm in their\r\nadherence to the prelate, would receive no command from the viceroy.\r\nFinding the churches still closed, and the people still more clamorous\r\nand angry, Gelves commanded De la Serna to revoke his censures; but\r\nthe archbishop answered, that \"what he had done was but an act of\r\ndivine justice against a cruel oppressor of the poor, whose cries had\r\nmoved him to compassion, and that the offender's contempt for his\r\nexcommunication had deserved the rigor of both of his censures,\r\nneither of which he would recall until Don Pedro de Mexia submitted\r\nhimself reverently to the church, received public absolution, and\r\nthrew up the unconscionable monopoly wherewith he had wronged the\r\ncommonwealth.\" \"But,\" says the chronicle of the day, \"the viceroy, not\r\nbrooking the saucy answer of a churchman, nor permitting him to\r\nimitate the spirit of the holy Ambrose against the Emperor\r\nTheodosius,\" forthwith sent orders to arrest De la Serna, and to carry\r\nhim to Vera Cruz, where he was to be confined in the castle of San\r\nJuan de Ulua until he could be despatched to Spain. The archbishop,\r\nhowever, followed by a long train of his prebends, priests, and\r\ncurates, immediately retired from the capital to the neighboring\r\nvillage of Guadalupe, but left a sentence of excommunication on the\r\ncathedral door against the viceroy himself! This was too much for the\r\nhaughty representative of the Spanish king to bear without resentment,\r\nand left no means open for conciliation between church and state.\r\nGelves could as little yield now, as De la Serna could before, and of\r\ncourse, nothing remained for him but to lay violent hands on the\r\nprelate wherever he might be found. His well paid soldiers were still\r\nfaithfully devoted to the viceroy, and he forthwith committed the\r\narchbishop's arrest to a reckless and unscrupulous officer named\r\nTirol. As soon as he had selected a band of armed men, upon whose\r\ncourage and obedience he could rely, this person hastened to the\r\nvillage of Guadalupe. In the meantime the archbishop was apprised of\r\nhis coming and prepared to meet him. He summoned his faithful clergy\r\nto attend in the sanctuary of the church, clad in their sacred\r\nvestments. For the first time, after many a long and weary day, the\r\nears of the people were saluted by the sound of bells calling them to\r\nthe house of God. Abandoning their business, some of them immediately\r\nfilled the square, eagerly demanding by what blessed interposition\r\nthey had been relieved from the fearful interdict,--while others\r\nthronged the doors and crowded the aisles of the long forsaken chapel.\r\nThe candles on the altar were lighted; the choir struck up a solemn\r\nhymn for the church; and, then, advancing along the aisle in gorgeous\r\nprocession, De la Serna and his priestly train took up their position\r\nin front of the tabernacle, where, crowned with his mitre, his crozier\r\nin one hand, and the holy sacrament in the other, this brave prelate\r\nawaited the forces which had been sent to seize him. It is difficult\r\nto say, if De la Serna designed by so imposing a spectacle to strike\r\nawe into the mind of the sacrilegious soldier, or whether he thought\r\nit his duty to be arrested, if arrested he must be, at that altar he\r\nhad sworn to serve. It is probable, however, from his exalted\r\ncharacter and courage, that the latter was the true motive of his act,\r\nand if so, he met his fate nobly in the cause of justice and religion.\r\n\r\nTirol was not long in traversing the distance between Mexico and\r\nGuadalupe. As soon as he arrived, he entered the church accompanied by\r\nhis officers and seemed appalled by the gorgeous and dramatic display\r\nround the shrine. Not a whisper was heard in the edifice as the crowd\r\nslowly parted to make way for the soldiers, who advanced along the\r\naisle and humbly knelt, for a moment, at the altar in prayer. This\r\ndone, Tirol approached De la Serna, and with \"fair and courteous\r\nwords\" required him to lay down the sacrament, to quit the sanctuary,\r\nand to listen to the orders issued in the royal name. The archbishop\r\nabruptly refused to comply, and answered, that \"As the viceroy was\r\nexcommunicated he regarded him as beyond the pale of the church and in\r\nno way empowered to command in Mexico;\" he, therefore, ordered the\r\nsoldiers, as they valued the peace of their souls, to desist from\r\ninfringing the privileges of the church by the exercise of secular\r\npower within its limits, and, he finally declared \"that he would, on\r\nno account, depart from the altar unless torn from it with the\r\nsacrament.\" Upon this Tirol arose, and read the order for his arrest,\r\ndescribing him as a \"traitor to the king, a disturber of the peace,\r\nand a mover of sedition in the commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nDe la Serna smiled contemptuously at the officer as he finished, and\r\ntaunted him with the viceroy's miserable attempt to cast upon the\r\nchurch the odium of sedition, when his creature Mexia was, in fact,\r\nthe shameless offender. He conjured Tirol \"not to violate the\r\nsanctuary to which he had retreated, lest his hand should be withered\r\nlike that of Jeroboam, who stretched forth an arm against the prophet\r\nof the Lord at the altar!\"\r\n\r\nTirol seems to have been a man upon whose nerves such appeals had but\r\nlittle effect. He was a blunt soldier, who received the orders of his\r\nsuperiors and performed them to the letter. He had been ordered to\r\narrest the archbishop wherever he found him, and he left the\r\necclesiastical scandal to be settled by those who sent him. Beckoning\r\nto a recreant priest who had been tampered with and brought along for\r\nthe purpose, he commanded him in the king's name, to wrest the\r\nsacrament from the prelate's hand. The clergyman, immediately mounting\r\nthe steps of the altar, obeyed the orders, and the desecrated bishop\r\nat once threw off his pontifical robes and yielded to civil power. The\r\ncowardly Mexicans made no attempt to protect their intrepid friend,\r\nwho, as he left the sanctuary, paused for a moment and stretched his\r\nhands in benediction over the recreants. Then bidding an affectionate\r\nfarewell to his clergy, whom he called to witness how zealously he had\r\nstriven to preserve the church from outrage, as well as the poor from\r\nplunder, he departed as a prisoner for Vera Cruz, whence he was\r\ndespatched for Spain in a vessel expressly equipped for his conveyance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a while the people were panic struck at this high-handed movement\r\nagainst the archbishop, but when the momentary effect had passed away\r\nand they began to reflect on the disgrace of the church as well as the\r\nloss of their protector, they vented their displeasure openly against\r\nMexia and the viceroy. The temper of the masses was at once noticed by\r\nthe clergy, who were still faithful to their persecuted bishop, nor\r\ndid they hesitate to fan the flame of discontent among the suffering\r\nIndians, Mestizos and Creoles, who omitted no occasion to express\r\ntheir hatred of the Spaniards, and especially of Tirol, who had been\r\nthe viceroy's tool in De la Serna's arrest. A fortnight elapsed after\r\nthe occurrences we have just detailed, and that daring officer had\r\nalready delivered his prisoner at Vera Cruz, and returned to Mexico.\r\nPopular clamor at once became loud against him; whenever he appeared\r\nin public he was assailed with curses and stones; until, at last, an\r\nenraged mob attacked him in his carriage with such violence that it\r\nwas alone owing to the swiftness of the mules, lashed by the\r\naffrighted postillion, that he escaped into the viceroyal palace,\r\nwhose gates were immediately barred against his pursuers. Meantime the\r\nnews had spread over town that this \"Judas,\"--\"this excommunicated\r\ndog,\"--had taken refuge with Gelves, and the neighboring market place\r\nbecame suddenly filled with an infuriated mob, numbering near seven\r\nthousand Indians, negroes and mulattoes, who rushed towards the palace\r\nwith the evident intention of attacking it. Seeing this outbreak from\r\na window, the viceroy sent a message to the assailants desiring them\r\nto retire, and declaring that Tirol had escaped by a postern. But the\r\nblood of the people was up, and not to be calmed by excuses. At this\r\njuncture several priests entered the crowd, and a certain Salazar was\r\nespecially zealous in exciting the multitude to summary revenge. The\r\npangs of hunger, were, for a moment, forgotten in the more bitter\r\nexcitement of religious outrage. By this time the mob obtained\r\nwhatever arms were nearest at hand. Poles, pikes, pistols, guns,\r\nhalberds, and stones were brought to the ground, and fierce onsets\r\nwere made on every accessible point of the palace. Neither the judges\r\nnor the police came forward to aid in staying the riot and protecting\r\nGelves:--\"Let the youngsters alone,\" exclaimed the observers, \"they\r\nwill soon find out both Mexia and Tirol, as well as their patron, and\r\nthe wrongs of the people will be quickly redressed!\" A portion of the\r\nmob drew off to an adjacent prison, whose doors were soon forced and\r\nthe convicts released.\r\n\r\nAt length, things became alarming to the besieged inmates of the\r\npalace, for they seemed to be entirely deserted by the respectable\r\ncitizens and police. Thereupon the viceroy ascended to the azotéa or\r\nflat roof of the palace with his guard and retainers, and, displaying\r\nthe royal standard, caused a trumpet to be sounded calling the people\r\nto uphold the king's authority. But the reply to his summons was still\r\nin an unrelenting tone--\"_Viva el Rey! Muera el mal gobierno; mueran\r\nlos dos comulgados!_\" \"Long live the king! but down with the wicked\r\ngovernment, and death to the excommunicated wretches!\" These shouts,\r\nyelled forth by the dense and surging mob, were followed by volleys,\r\ndischarged at the persons on the azotéa, who, for three hours,\r\nreturned the shots and skirmished with the insurgents. Stones, also,\r\nwere hurled from the parapet upon the crowd, but it is related in the\r\nchronicles of the time, that not a single piece of ordnance was\r\ndischarged upon the people, \"for the viceroy, in those days, had none\r\nfor the defence of his palace or person, neither had that great city\r\nany for its strength and security.\"\r\n\r\nSo passed the noon and evening of that disastrous day; but, at night\r\nfall, the baffled mob that had been unable to make any impression with\r\ntheir feeble weapons upon the massive walls of the palace, brought pitch\r\nand inflammable materials, with which they fired the gates of the\r\nviceroyal palace. The bright flames of these combustibles sent up their\r\nlight in the still evening air, and, far and wide over the town spread\r\nthe news that the beautiful city was about to be destroyed. Frightened\r\nfrom their retreats, the judges and chief citizens who had influence\r\nwith the people rushed to the _plaza_, and, by their urgent entreaties,\r\nefforts were made to extinguish the fire. But the palace gates had\r\nalready fallen, and, over their smouldering ruins, the infuriated\r\nassailants rushed into the edifice to commence the work of destruction.\r\nThe magistrates, however, who had never taken part against the people in\r\ntheir quarrels, soon appeared upon the field, and, by loud entreaties,\r\nstopped the _saqueo_. It was soon discovered that Mexia and Tirol had\r\nescaped by a postern, whilst the conquered viceroy, disguised as a\r\nfriar, stole through the crowd to the Franciscan cloister, where, for\r\nmany a day, he lay concealed in the sanctuary which his rapacious spirit\r\nhad denied to the venerable De la Serna.\r\n\r\nSo ended this base attempt of a Spanish nobleman and representative of\r\nroyalty in America, to enrich himself by plundering the docile\r\nMexicans. The fate of Mexia and Tirol is unknown. But Spanish\r\ninjustice towards the colonies was strongly marked by the reception of\r\nthe viceroy and the archbishop on their return from Madrid. Gelves, it\r\nis true, was recalled, but, after being graciously welcomed at court,\r\nwas made \"master of the royal horse;\" while the noble hearted De la\r\nSerna was degraded from his Mexican arch-prelacy; and banished to the\r\npetty bishopric of Zamora in Castile!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: \"Como Rey y Señor de las Españas,\" says the authority.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: \"A new survey of the West Indies, or The English\r\nAmerican, his Travels by land and sea; by Thomas Gage, London, 1677,\r\nsee p. 176.\" It is due to impartial history and to the memory of the\r\nMarques de Gelves to state that a different account of these\r\noccurrences is given by Ramon J. Alcaraz, a modern Mexican writer in\r\nthe Liceo Mexicano, vol. 2, p. 120. Alcaraz fortifies his views by\r\nsome documents, and by a justificatory commentary of the Marques\r\nhimself. But he, like Gage, does not state his _authorities_. The\r\nstory as related by the English friar is very characteristic of the\r\nage, and, _si non e vero e ben trovato_. Those who are anxious to\r\ndiscover the innocence or guilt of the viceroy, with certainty, will\r\nhave a difficult task in exploring the Spanish manuscripts of the\r\nperiod. The British traveller Gage, _was on the spot in the year after\r\nthe events occurred_, and his subsequent abandonment of the Catholic\r\nchurch would not be likely to lead him into the espousal of the\r\narchbishop de la Serna's cause against the viceroy.\r\n\r\nCAVO in his work entitled--\"Tres Siglos de Mexico,\"--states that the\r\naccount he gives of this transaction is taken from _five_ different\r\nnarratives of it which were published at the time of its\r\noccurrence--three in favor of the viceroy and two sustaining the cause\r\nof the archbishop. In the last two, he alleges, that all the\r\nimputations against the archbishop were disproved, and that all the\r\ncharges against the viceroy were sustained by solid argument.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1624-1642.\r\n\r\n    THE AUDIENCIA RULES IN THE INTERREGNUM.--CARILLO\r\n    VISITADOR.--INQUISITORIAL EXAMINATION.--ACAPULCO TAKEN.--ATTACKS\r\n    BY THE DUTCH.--REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL PROPOSED.--ARMENDARIZ\r\n    VICEROY.--ESCALONA VICEROY.--PALAFOX'S CONDUCT TO THE\r\n    VICEROY.--PALAFOX VICEROY--HIS GOOD AND EVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON RODERIGO PACHECO OSORIO, MARQUES DE CERRALVO, XV. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1624-1635.\r\n\r\nUpon the violent expulsion of the viceroy Gelves by the popular\r\noutbreak, narrated in the last chapter, the government of New Spain\r\nfell once more into the hands of the _Audiencia_ during the\r\ninterregnum. This body immediately adopted suitable measures to\r\nterminate the disaffection. The people were calmed by the deposition\r\nof one they deemed an unjust ruler; but for a long time it was found\r\nnecessary to keep on foot in the capital, large bands of armed men, in\r\norder to restrain those troublesome persons who are always ready to\r\navail themselves of any pretext for tumultuary attacks either against\r\nproperty or upon people who are disposed to maintain the supremacy of\r\nlaw and order.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Philip IV. was apprised of the disturbances in his\r\ntransatlantic colony, he trembled for the security of Spanish power in\r\nthat distant realm, and immediately despatched Don Martin Carillo,\r\nInquisitor of Valladolid, with unlimited power to examine into the riots\r\nof the capital and to punish the guilty participants in a signal and\r\nsummary manner. It is not our purpose, at present, to discuss the\r\npropriety of sending from Spain special judges, in the character of\r\nVisitadores or Inquisitors, whenever crimes were committed by eminent\r\nindividuals in the colony, or by large bodies of people, which required\r\nthe infliction of decided punishment. But it may be regarded as one of\r\nthe characteristic features of the age, and as demonstrative of the\r\npeculiar temper of the king that an Inquisitor was selected upon this\r\noccasion for so delicate and dangerous a duty. It is true that the\r\nchurch, through the late archbishop, was concerned in this painful\r\naffair; but it little accords with the ideas of our age to believe it\r\nnecessary that a subject of such public concern as the insurrection\r\nagainst an unjust and odious viceroy should be confined to the walls of\r\nan inquisition or conducted by one of its leading functionaries alone.\r\nHad the investigation been intrusted exclusively to a civil and not an\r\necclesiastical judge, it is very questionable whether he should have\r\nbeen sent from Spain for this purpose alone. Being a foreigner, at least\r\nso far as the colony was concerned, he could have scarcely any knowledge\r\nof or sympathy with the colonists. Extreme impartiality may have been\r\nensured by this fact; yet as the Visitador or Inquisitor departed, as\r\nsoon as his special function ceased, he was never responsible for his\r\ndecrees to that wholesome public opinion which visits the conduct of a\r\njudge with praise or condemnation during his life time when he\r\npermanently resides in a country, and, is always the safest guardian of\r\nthe liberty of the citizen.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that the Inquisitor administered his office fairly\r\nand even leniently in this case, for his judgments fell chiefly on the\r\nthieves who stole the personal effects of the viceroy during the\r\nsacking of the palace. The principal movers in the insurrection had\r\nabsented themselves from the capital, and prudently remained in\r\nconcealment until the Visitador terminated his examinations, inflicted\r\nhis punishments upon the culprits he convicted, and crossed the sea to\r\nreport his proceedings at court.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarillo had been accompanied to New Spain by a new viceroy, Don\r\nRoderigo Pacheco Osorio, Marques of Cerralvo, who arrived in the\r\ncapital on the 3d of November, 1624, and assumed the government. He\r\nleft the examination of the insurrection entirely in the hands of the\r\nInquisitor and directed his attention to the public affairs of the\r\ncolony. These he found peaceful, except that a Dutch squadron, under\r\nthe command of the prince of Nassau attacked Acapulco, and the feeble\r\ncity and garrison readily surrendered without resistance. The fleet\r\nheld the city, however, only for a few days, and set sail for other\r\nenterprises. This assault upon an important port alarmed the viceroy,\r\nwho, at once, sent orders to have the town immediately surrounded with\r\na wall, and suitable forts and bastions erected which would guard it\r\nin all subsequent attacks. These fortifications were hardly commenced\r\nwhen another Dutch fleet appeared before the town. But this time the\r\nvisit was not of a hostile nature;--it was an exhausted fleet,\r\ndemanding water and provisions, after recovering which it resumed its\r\ntrack for the East Indies. Whilst the Spaniards were thus succoring\r\nand sustaining their enemies the Dutch, a dreadful famine scourged\r\nSinaloa and neighboring provinces, carrying off upwards of eight\r\nthousand Indians.\r\n\r\nDuring the long reign of the present monarch, Philip IV., Spain was\r\nfrequently at war with England, Holland, and France; and the Dutch,\r\nwho inflicted dreadful ravages on the American coasts, secured immense\r\nspoil from the Spaniards. In 1628, Pedro Hein, a Hollander of great\r\ndistinction, placed a squadron in the gulf on the coasts of Florida to\r\nintercept the fleet of New Spain. The resistance made by the Spaniards\r\nwas feeble, and, their vessels being captured by the Dutch, the\r\ncommerce of Mexico experienced a severe blow from which it was long in\r\nrecovering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1629, there were ecclesiastical troubles in the colony, growing out\r\nof an attempt by the higher order of the Spanish clergy to prevent the\r\nincrease of the regular priesthood from among the natives of the\r\ncountry. They feared that in the course of time the dominion of the\r\nestablishment would thus be wrested from their hands by the power of the\r\nMexicans. The king, himself was appealed to on this subject and caused\r\nit to be examined into carefully. In 1631, in consequence of the\r\nrepeated danger of the capital from floods, the project of removing the\r\nsite from its present location, to the loftier levels between Tacuba and\r\nTacubaya, was seriously argued before the people. But the interest of\r\nproperty holders, and inhabitants of the city would have been so\r\nseriously affected by this act, that the idea was abandoned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe remaining years of this viceroyalty were consumed in matters of\r\nmere local detail and domestic government, and in fact we know but\r\nlittle of it, save that the severe inundations of 1629 caused the\r\nauthorities to use their utmost efforts in prosecuting the work of the\r\n_desague_, as we have already seen in the general account given of\r\nthat gigantic enterprise. In 1635 this viceroy's reign terminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON LOPE DIAZ DE ARMENDARIZ, MARQUES DE CADEREITA, XVI. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1635-1640.\r\n\r\nThe five years of this personage's government were unmarked by any\r\nevents of consequence in the colony; except that in the last of\r\nthem,--1640,--he despatched an expedition to the north, where he\r\nfounded in New Leon, the town of Cadereita, which the emigrants named\r\nin honor of their viceroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO LOPEZ PACHECO CABRERA Y BOBADILLA, DUKE OF ESCALONA, MARQUES\r\nOF VILBUA AND GRANDEE OF SPAIN OF THE FIRST CLASS. XVII. VICEROY OF\r\nNEW SPAIN. 1640-1642.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Escalona succeeded the Marques of Cadereita, and arrived\r\nin Mexico on the 28th of June, 1640, together with the venerable\r\nPalafox, who came, in the character of Visitador, to inquire into the\r\nadministration of the last viceroy whose reputation, like that of\r\nother chief magistrates in New Spain, had suffered considerably in the\r\nhands of his enemies. Whilst this functionary proceeded with his\r\ndisagreeable task against a man who was no longer in power, the duke,\r\nin compliance with the king's command ordered the governor of Sinaloa,\r\nDon Luis Cestinos, accompanied by two Jesuits, to visit the\r\nCalifornias and examine their coasts and the neighboring isles in\r\nsearch of the wealth in pearls and precious metals with which they\r\nwere reputed to be filled. The reports of the explorers were\r\naltogether satisfactory both as to the character of the natives and of\r\nthe riches of the waters as well as of the mines, though they\r\nrepresented the soil as extremely sterile. The gold of California was\r\nreserved for another age.\r\n\r\nEver since the conquest the instruction of Indians in christian\r\ndoctrine had been confided exclusively to the _regular_ clergy of the\r\nRoman Catholic church. The _secular_ priests were, thus, entirely\r\ndeprived of the privilege of mingling their cares with their monastic\r\nbrethren, who, in the course of time, began to regard this as an\r\nabsolute, indefeasible right, whose enjoyment they were unwilling to\r\nforego, especially as the _obvenciones_ or tributes of the Indian\r\nconverts, formed no small item of corporate wealth in their respective\r\norders. The Indians were, in fact, lawful tributaries, not only of\r\nthe whole church, in the estimation of these friars, but of the\r\nspecial sect or brotherhood which happened to obtain the first hold on\r\na tribe or nation by its missionary residence among its people.\r\nPalafox requested the Duke of Escalona to deprive the monkish orders\r\nof this monopoly; a desire to which the viceroy at once acceded,\r\ninasmuch as he was anxious to serve the bishop in all matters\r\npertaining to his religious functions.\r\n\r\nThe kindly feeling of the viceroy does not appear to have been\r\nappreciated, or sincerely responded to by Palafox. This personage was\r\nremoved in 1642, to the archiepiscopal see of Mexico, and under the\r\npretext of installation in his new office and opening his tribunals,\r\nhe visited the capital with the actual design of occupying the\r\nviceroyal throne to which he had been appointed! This was a sudden and\r\naltogether unexpected blow to the worthy duke, who was so\r\nunceremoniously supplanted. No one seems to have whispered to him even\r\na suspicion of the approaching calamity, until the crafty Palafox\r\nassembled the oidores at midnight on the eve of Pentecost, and read to\r\nthem the royal despatches containing his commission. His conduct to\r\nthe jovial hearted duke, who was no match, in all probability, for the\r\nwily churchman, was not only insincere but unmannerly, for,\r\nimmediately after the assumption of his power at dead of night, he\r\ncommanded a strong guard to surround the palace at dawn, and required\r\nthe Oidor Lugo, to read the royal cedula to the duke even before he\r\nleft his bed. The deposed viceroy immediately departed for the convent\r\nat Churubusco, outside the city walls on the road to San Agustin de\r\nlas Cuevas. All his property was sequestrated, and his money and\r\njewels were secured within the treasury.\r\n\r\nThe reader will naturally seek for an explanation of this political\r\nenigma, or base intrigue, and its solution is again eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the reign in which it occurred. It will be\r\nremembered that the Duke of Braganza had been declared King of\r\nPortugal, which kingdom had separated itself from the Spanish\r\ndomination, causing no small degree of animosity among the Castilians\r\nagainst the Portuguese and all who favored them. The Duke of Escalona,\r\nunfortunately, was related to the house of Braganza, and the credulous\r\nPhilip having heard that his viceroy exhibited some evidences of\r\nattachment to the Portuguese, resolved to supercede him by Palafox.\r\nBesides this, the Duke committed the impolitic act of appointing a\r\nPortuguese, to the post of Castellan of St. Juan de Ulua; and, upon a\r\ncertain occasion, when two horses had been presented to him by Don\r\nPedro de Castilla, and Don Cristobal de _Portugal_, he unluckily,\r\nremarked that he liked best the horse that was offered by _Portugal_!\r\nIt is difficult to believe that such trifles would affect the destiny\r\nof empires, when they were discussed by grave statesmen and monarchs.\r\nBut such was the miserable reign of Philip IV.;--the most disastrous\r\nindeed, in the annals of Spain, except that of Roderic the Goth. Folly\r\nlike this may justly be attributed to the imbecile king, who witnessed\r\nthe Catalan insurection, the loss of Rousillon, Conflans, a part of\r\nCordaña, Jamaica, and, above all, of Portugal; and who, moreover,\r\nrecognized the independence of the Seven United Provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN DE PALAFOX Y MENDOZA, BISHOP OF PUEBLA--CHOSEN ARCHBISHOP OF\r\nMEXICO, VISITADOR OF NEW SPAIN, &C. &C., XVIII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.\r\n1642.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Palafox as viceroy was of but short duration. He\r\noccupied the colonial throne but five months, yet, during that brief\r\nspace, he did something that signalized his name both honorably and\r\ndisgracefully. He seems to have been ridiculously bent upon the\r\nsacrifice of all the interesting monuments which were still preserved\r\nfrom the period of the conquest as memorials of the art and idolatry\r\nof the Aztecs. These he collected from all quarters and destroyed. He\r\nwas evidently no friend of the friars, but sought to build up and\r\nstrengthen the secular clergy whose free circulation in the world\r\nbrought them directly under the eyes of society, and whose order made\r\nthem dependent upon that society, and not upon a corporation, for\r\nmaintenance. During his short reign he manifested kindness for the\r\nIndians; caused justice to be promptly administered, and even\r\nsuspended certain worthy oidores who did not work as quickly and\r\ndecide as promptly as he thought they ought to; he regulated the\r\nordinances of the Audiencia; prepared the statutes of the university;\r\nraised a large body of militia to be in readiness in case of an attack\r\nfrom the Portuguese; visited the colleges under his secular\r\njurisdiction; and, finally, in proof of his disinterestedness, refused\r\nthe salary of viceroy and visitador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1642-1654.\r\n\r\n    SOTOMAYOR VICEROY.--ESCALONA VINDICATED.--MONASTIC\r\n    PROPERTY.--BIGOTRY OF PALAFOX.--GUZMAN VICEROY.--INDIAN\r\n    INSURRECTION.--REVOLT OF THE TARAHUMARES.--SUCCESS OF THE\r\n    INDIANS--INDIAN WARS.--DUKE DE ALBURQUERQUE VICEROY--ATTEMPT TO\r\n    ASSASSINATE HIM.--COUNT DE BANOS VICEROY.--ATTEMPT TO\r\n    COLONIZE.--ESCOBAR Y LLAMAS AND DE TOLEDO VICEROYS.--DEPREDATIONS\r\n    OF BRITISH CRUISERS.--NUNO DE PORTUGAL VICEROY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON GARCIA SARMIENTO DE SOTOMAYOR, COUNT DE SALVATIERRA, MARQUES DE\r\nSOBROSO, XIX. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1642-1648.\r\n\r\nPhilip IV. seems to have been more anxious to use Palafox as an\r\ninstrument to remove the Duke of Escalona, than to empower him, for\r\nany length of time, with viceroyal authority; for, no sooner did he\r\nsuppose that the duke was displaced quietly without leaving the\r\ngovernment in the hands of the Audiencia, than he appointed the Conde\r\nde Salvatierra as his representative. This nobleman reached his\r\ngovernment on the 23d of November, 1642, and Palafox immediately\r\nretired from his office, still preserving, however, the functions of\r\nVisitador. At the conclusion of this year the duke departed from\r\nChurubusco for San Martin, in order to prepare for his voyage home;\r\nand in 1643, this ill used personage left New Spain having previously\r\nfortified himself with numerous certificates of his loyalty to the\r\nSpanish crown, all of which he used so skilfully in vindication before\r\nthe vacillating and imbecile king, that he was not only exculpated\r\nentirely, but offered once more the viceroyalty from which he had been\r\nso rudely thrust. The duke promptly rejected the proposed restoration,\r\nbut accepted the viceroyalty of Sicily. Before he departed for the\r\nseat of government, he gave the king many wise councils as to his\r\nAmerican colonies, but, especially advised him to colonize the\r\nCalifornias. Don Pedro Portal de Casañete was commissioned by Philip\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1644, there were already in Mexico twelve convents of nuns, and\r\nnearly an equal number for males, which, either by the unwise but\r\npious zeal of wealthy persons, were becoming rich and aggregating to\r\nthemselves a large amount of urban and rural property. Besides this\r\nthe dependants upon these convents, both males and females, were\r\nlargely increasing;--all of which so greatly prejudiced not only\r\nproperty but population, that the Ayuntamiento or City Council\r\nsolicited the king not to permit the establishment in future of\r\nsimilar foundations, and to prohibit the acquisition of real estate by\r\nmonasteries, inasmuch as the time might come when these establishments\r\nwould be the only proprietors.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Casañete arrived in Mexico on his way to the shores of the\r\nPacific. Salvatierra received him kindly and made proper efforts to\r\nequip him for the enterprise. The chiefs and governors of the interior\r\nwere ordered to aid him in every way; but just as he was about to\r\nsail, two of his vessels were burned, whereupon his soldiers\r\ndispersed, whilst the families of his colonists withdrew, in hope of\r\nbeing again soon summoned to embark.\r\n\r\nThe civil government of Salvatierra passed in quietness; but the\r\ndomineering spirit of Palafox did not allow the church to remain at\r\npeace with the state. In 1647, this lordly churchman engaged in warm\r\ndiscussion with the Jesuits and other orders. Most scandalous scenes\r\noccurred in the churches of Puebla. Anathemas, excommunications, and\r\nall the artillery of the church were used against each other. Palafox\r\npersevered in his rancorous controversy as long as he remained in\r\nAmerica, and even after his return to Europe, pursued his quarrel at\r\nthe court of Rome. At the close of this year Salvatierra was removed\r\nto the viceroyalty of Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON MARCOS DE TORRES Y RUEDA, BISHOP OF YUCATAN--GOVERNOR OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. XX. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1648-1649.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Torres y Rueda was brief and eventless. It extended from\r\nthe 13th of March, 1648, to the 22d of April, 1649, when the\r\nbishop-governor died, and was sumptuously interred in the church of\r\nSan Agustin in the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON LUIS ENRIQUEZ DE GUZMAN, COUNT DE ALVADELISTE. XXI. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1649-1654.\r\n\r\nThe Audiencia ruled in New Spain until the 3d of July, 1650, the\r\nperiod of the Conde de Alvadeliste's arrival in the capital. This\r\nnobleman had been, in fact, appointed by the king immediately upon the\r\ntransfer of the Conde de Salvatierra to Peru; but inasmuch as he could\r\nnot immediately cross the Atlantic, the bishop of Yucatan had been\r\ndirected to assume his functions _ad interim_. Alvadeliste, a man of\r\namiable character and gentle manners, soon won the good opinion of the\r\nSpanish colonists and creoles. But if he was to experience but little\r\ntrouble from his countrymen and their descendants, he was not to\r\nescape a vexatious outbreak among the northern Indians, who had\r\nremained quiet for so long that it was supposed they were finally and\r\nsuccessfully subjected to the Spanish yoke.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy had not been long installed when he received news of a\r\nrebellion against the Spaniards by the Tarahumares, who inhabited\r\nportions of Chihuahua and Sinaloa, and who hitherto yielded implicitly\r\nto the gentle and persuasive voice of the evangelical teachers\r\ndwelling among them. The portion of this tribe inhabiting Sinaloa,\r\ncommenced the assault, but the immediate cause of the rebellion is not\r\nknown. We are not aware whether they experienced a severe local\r\ngovernment at the hands of the Spaniards, whether they were tired of\r\nthe presence of the children of the Peninsula, or whether they feared\r\nthat the priestly rule was only another means of subjecting them more\r\neasily to the crown of Castile. Perhaps all these causes influenced\r\nthe rebellion. Already in 1648, the chief of the nation had\r\ncompromised three other tribes in the meditated outbreak; but, lacking\r\nthe concerted action of the Tepehuanes and other bands, upon whose aid\r\nthey confidently counted, they resolved to attack, alone, the village\r\nof San Francisco de Borja, whose garrison and village they slaughtered\r\nand burned. San Francisco was the settlement which supplied the local\r\nmissions with provisions, and its loss was consequently irreparable to\r\nthat portion of the country.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the chief judge of Parral heard of this sanguinary\r\nonslaught he hastily gathered the neighboring farmers, herdsmen, and\r\nmerchants, and hastened into the wilderness against the insurgents,\r\nwho fled when they had destroyed the great depot of the Spaniards.\r\nThe troops, hardy as they were on these distant frontiers, were not\r\ncalculated for the rough warfare of woodsmen, and after some\r\ninsignificant and unsuccessful skirmishes with the marauders, the new\r\nlevies retired hastily to their homes.\r\n\r\nFajardo, governor of Nueva Biscaya, soon heard of the rebellion and of\r\nthe ineffectual efforts to suppress it. He was satisfied that no time\r\nwas to be lost in crushing the rebellion, and, accordingly marched\r\nwith Juan Barraza, to the seat of war with an adequate force. The\r\nIndians had meanwhile left their villages and betaken themselves to\r\nthe mountains, woods and fastnesses. Fajardo immediately burned their\r\nabandoned habitations and desolated their cultivated fields; and when\r\nthe Indians, who were now satisfied of their impotence, demanded\r\npeace, he granted it on condition that the four insurgent chiefs of\r\nthe rebellion should be surrendered for punishment. The natives, in\r\nreply, brought him the head of one of their leaders, together with his\r\nwife and child; soon after another head was delivered to him, and, in\r\na few days, the other two leaders surrendered.\r\n\r\nThis, for a while, calmed the country; but in order to confirm the\r\npeace and friendship which seemed to be now tolerably well\r\nestablished, a mission was founded in the valley of Papigochi, in\r\nwhich the chief population of the Tarahumares resided. The reverend\r\nJesuit, Father Bendin, was charged with the duty of establishing this\r\nbenignant government of the church, and in a short time it appeared\r\nthat he had succeeded in civilizing the Indians and in converting them\r\nto the Christian faith. There were, nevertheless, discontented men\r\namong the tribes, whose incautious acts occasionally gave warning of\r\nthe animosity which still lingered in the breasts of the Indians. The\r\nmost prudent of the Spaniards warned the governor of Nueva Biscaya to\r\nbeware a sudden or personal attack. But this personage treated the\r\nadvice with contempt, and felt certain that the country was\r\nsubstantially pacified. Nevertheless, whilst things wore this aspect\r\nof seeming calm, three chiefs or caciques, who had embraced the\r\nCatholic faith, prepared the elements for a new rebellion, and, on the\r\n5th of June, 1649, at daybreak, they attacked the dwelling of the\r\nmissionaries, set fire to its combustible materials, and surrounding\r\nthe blazing house in numbers, awaited the moment when the unsuspecting\r\ninmates attempted to escape. The venerable Bendin and his companions\r\nwere quickly aroused, but no sooner did they rush from the flames than\r\nthey were cruelly slain by the Indians. The church was then sacked.\r\nThe valuables were secured and carried off by the murderous robbers,\r\nbut all the images and religious emblems were sacrilegiously destroyed\r\nbefore the Indians fled to the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFajardo once more despatched Juan Barraza, with three hundred Spanish\r\nsoldiers and some Indians against the rebel Tarahumares. But the tribe\r\nhad, in its intercourse with the foreigners, acquired some little\r\nknowledge of the art of war and consequently did not await the\r\nexpected attack in the open or level fields, where the Spanish cavalry\r\ncould act powerfully against them. They retired, accordingly, to a\r\nrocky pass, flanked by two streams, which they fortified, at all\r\npoints, with stone walls and other formidable impediments. Here they\r\nrested in security until the Spanish forces approached them; nor did\r\nthey, even then abandon their defensive warfare. Barraza, finding the\r\nIndians thus skilfully entrenched behind barriers and ready to repel\r\nhis attack, was unable, after numerous efforts, to dislodge them from\r\ntheir position. Indeed, he appears to have suffered serious losses in\r\nhis vain assaults; so that, instead of routing the natives entirely,\r\nhe found it necessary to withdraw his troops who were greatly weakened\r\nby losses, whilst the daring insurgents continually received auxiliary\r\nreinforcements. In this untoward state of affairs, Barraza resolved to\r\nmake his escape, during the night, from such dangerous quarters, and,\r\nordering his Indian allies to light the usual watch-fires, and keep up\r\nthe ordinary bustle of a camp, he silently but gradually withdrew all\r\nhis Spanish and native forces, so that at daybreak the Tarahumares\r\nfound the country cleared of their foes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Fajardo heard of the forced retreat of Barraza he\r\ndetermined to take the management of the campaign in his own hands.\r\nBut his military efforts were as unsuccessful as those of his\r\nunfortunate captain. The rainy season came on before he could make a\r\nsuccessful lodgement in the heart of the enemy's country, and his\r\nmarch was impeded by floods which destroyed the roads and rendered the\r\nstreams impassable. Accordingly he retired to Parral, where he\r\nreceived orders from the viceroy to establish a garrison in Papigochi.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards found that their cruelty in the first campaign against\r\nthese untamed savages had inflamed their minds against the viceroyal\r\ntroops. They attempted, therefore, to use, once more, the language of\r\npersuasion, and, offering the insurgents a perfect amnesty for the\r\npast, prevailed upon the old inhabitants of the vale of Papigochi to\r\nreturn to their former residences, where, however, they did not long\r\nremain faithful to their promised allegiance. The new garrison was\r\nestablished, as had been commanded by the viceroy; but, in 1652, the\r\nrelentless tribes, again seizing an unguarded moment, burned the\r\nbarracks, and destroyed in the flames a number of Spaniards, two\r\nFranciscan monks, and a Jesuit priest. The soldiery of Barraza and the\r\ngovernor retired from the doomed spot, amid showers of Indian arrows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1653, the war was resumed. The whole country was aroused and armed\r\nagainst these hitherto invincible bands. Other Indian tribes were\r\nsubdued by the Spanish forces, and their arms were then, once more,\r\nturned upon the Tarahumares, at a moment when the Indian chiefs were\r\ndistant from the field. But the absence of the leaders neither\r\ndismayed nor disconcerted these relentless warriors. The Spaniards\r\nwere again forced to retire; and the viceroy caused an extensive\r\nenlistment to be undertaken, and large sums appropriated to crush or\r\npacify the audacious bands. Before the final issue and subjugation,\r\nhowever, the Conde de Alvadeliste, received the king's command to pass\r\nfrom Mexico to the government of Peru, and, awaiting only the arrival\r\nof his successor, he sailed from Acapulco for his new viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ DE LA CUEVA, DUKE DE ALBURQUERQUE, XXII.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1654-1660.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alburquerque, who had married the Doña Juana, daughter of\r\nthe former viceroy, Don Lope Diaz de Armendariz, arrived in Mexico on\r\nthe 16th of August, 1654, as successor of Alvadeliste. His accession\r\nwas signalized by unusually splendid ceremonies in the capital, and\r\nthe new viceroy immediately devoted himself to the improvement of\r\nMexico, as well as to the internal administration of affairs. He\r\nzealously promoted the public works of the country; labored diligently\r\nto finish the cathedral; devoted himself, in hours of leisure, to the\r\npromotion of literature and the fine arts; regulated the studies in\r\nthe university; and caused the country to be scoured for the\r\napprehension of robbers and vagabonds who infested and rendered\r\ninsecure all the highways of the colony. Great numbers of these\r\nwretches were soon seized and hanged after summary trials.\r\n\r\nIn 1656, the British forces having been successful against Jamaica,\r\nthe Mexicans were apprehensive that their arms would next be turned\r\nagainst New Spain; and accordingly Alburquerque fitted out an armada\r\nto operate against the enemy among the islands before they could reach\r\nthe coast of his viceroyalty. This well designed expedition failed,\r\nand most of the soldiers who engaged in it, perished. The duke,\r\nunsuccessful in war, next turned his attention to the gradual and\r\npeaceful extension, northward, of the colonial emigration; and,\r\ndistributing a large portion of the territory of New Mexico among a\r\nhundred families, he founded the city of Alburquerque, and established\r\nin it several Franciscan missions as the nucleus of future population.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1659 was signalized in Mexico by one of those horrid dramas\r\nwhich occasionally took place in all countries into which the\r\nmonstrous institution of the Inquisition was unfortunately\r\nnaturalized, and fifty human victims were burned alive by order of the\r\n_Audiencia_. For the credit of the country it must be remembered that\r\nthis was the first occurrence of the kind, but, either from curiosity\r\nor from a superior sense of duty, the dreadful pageant was not only\r\nwitnessed by an immense crowd of eager spectators, but was even\r\npresided over by the viceroy himself. In 1660 the duke narrowly\r\nescaped death by the hands of an assassin. Whilst on his knees at\r\nprayer in a chapel of the cathedral, the murderer,--a youthful soldier\r\nseventeen years old,--stole behind him, and was in the act of striking\r\nthe fatal blow when he was arrested. In less than twelve hours he had\r\ngone to account for the meditated crime.\r\n\r\nAlburquerque appears to have been popular, useful and intelligent,\r\nthough, from his portrait which is preserved in the gallery of the\r\nviceroys in Mexico, we would have imagined him to be a gross\r\nsensualist, resembling more the usual pictorial representations of\r\nSancho Panza than one who was calculated to wield the destinies of an\r\nempire. Nevertheless the expression of public sorrow was unfeigned and\r\nloud among all classes when he departed for Spain in the year 1660.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN DE LEYVA Y DE LA CERDA, MARQUES DE LEYVA Y DE LA CERDA, COUNT\r\nDE BAÑOS XXIII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1660-1664.\r\n\r\nThe successor of the Duke of Alburquerque entered Mexico on the 16th\r\nof September, 1660. Don Juan de Leyva y de la Cerda approached the\r\ncolony with the best wishes and resolutions to advance its prosperity\r\nand glory. His earliest efforts were directed to the pacification of\r\nthe Tarahumares, whose insurrection was still entirely unquelled, and\r\nwhose successes were alarmingly disastrous in New Mexico, whither they\r\nadvanced in the course of their savage warfare. With the same liberal\r\nspirit that characterized his predecessor, he continued to be the\r\nzealous friend of those remote, frontier colonists, and, in a short\r\ntime, formed twenty-four villages. It was, doubtless, his plan to\r\nsubdue and pacify the north by an armed occupation.\r\n\r\nIn 1661 and 1662, the despotic conduct of the Spaniards to the Indians\r\nstirred up sedition in the south as well as at the north. The natives\r\nof Tehuantepec were, at this period, moved to rebellion, with the hope\r\nof securing their personal liberty, even if they could not reconquer\r\ntheir national independence. Spanish forces were immediately marched\r\nto crush the insurrection; but the soft children of the south were not\r\nas firmly pertinacious in resistance as their sturdier brothers of the\r\nnorthern frontier. More accessible to the gentle voices of an\r\ninsinuating clergy, they yielded to the persuasive eloquence of the\r\nbishop Ildefonzo Davalos, who, animated by honest and humane zeal for\r\nthe children of the forest, went among the incensed tribes, and, by\r\nkindness, secured the submission which arms could not compel at the\r\nnorth. For this voluntary and valuable service the sovereign conferred\r\non him the mitre of Mexico, which, in the year 1664, was renounced by\r\nOsorio Escobar.\r\n\r\nThe only other event of note, during this viceroyalty, was an attempt\r\nat colonization and pearl fishing on the coasts of California by\r\nBernal Piñaredo, who seems rather to have disturbed than to have\r\nbenefitted the sparse settlers on those distant shores. He was coldly\r\nreceived on his return by the viceroy, who formally accused him to the\r\ncourt for misconduct during the expedition.\r\n\r\nDon Juan de Leyva sailed for Spain in 1664, and soon after died,\r\nafflicted by severe family distresses, and, especially by the\r\nmisconduct of his son and heir.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO OSORIO ESCOBAR Y LLAMAS, BISHOP OF PUEBLA. XXIV. VICEROY OF\r\nNEW SPAIN. 1664.\r\n\r\nThe reign of this ecclesiastic was remarkable for nothing except its\r\nextraordinarily brief duration. The bishop entered upon his duties on\r\nthe 29th of June, and resigned them in favor of his successor on the\r\n15th of the next October.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON SEBASTIAN DE TOLEDO, MARQUES DE MANCERA; XXV. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1664-1673.\r\n\r\nNew Spain enjoyed profound internal peace when Don Sebastian arrived\r\nin the capital on the 15th of October, 1664. But the calm of the\r\npolitical world does not seem to have extended to the terrestrial,\r\nfor, about this period, occurred one of the few eruptions of the\r\nfamous mountain of Popocatepetl,--the majestic volcano which lies on\r\nthe eastern edge of the valley, and is the most conspicuous object\r\nfrom all parts of the upper table lands of Mexico. For four days it\r\npoured forth showers of stones from its crater and then, suddenly,\r\nsubsided into quietness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1666 a royal _cedula_ was received from the queen\r\napprising her faithful subjects of her husband's death, and that\r\nduring the minority of Charles II. the government would be carried on\r\nby her. The loss of Jamaica, during the last reign was irreparable for\r\nSpain. The possession of so important an island by the British,\r\nenabled the enemies of Castile to find a lurking place in the\r\nneighborhood of her richest colonies from which the pirates and\r\nprivateers could readily issue for the capture of Spanish commerce or\r\nwealth. The armada of the Marques of Cadareita, was useless against\r\nthe small armed craft which not only possessed great advantages in\r\nswiftness of sailing, but was able, also, to escape from the enemies'\r\npursuit or guns in the shallows along the coast into which the larger\r\nvessels dared not follow them. But the general war in Europe which had\r\ntroubled the peace of the old world for so many years, had now drawn\r\nto a close, and a peace was once more, for a while re-established. The\r\nambitious desires of the Europeans, were now, however, turned towards\r\nAmerica, and, with eager and envious glances at the possessions of\r\nthe Spaniards. The narrow, protective system of Spain, had, as we\r\nhave related in our introductory chapter, closed the colonial ports\r\nagainst all vessels and cargoes that were not Spanish. This, of\r\ncourse, was the origin of an extensive system of contraband, which had\r\ndoubtless done much to corrupt the character of the masses, whilst it\r\ncreated a class of bold, daring and reckless men, whose\r\nrepresentatives may still be found, even at this day, in the ports of\r\nMexico and South America. This contraband trade not only affected the\r\npersonal character of the people, but naturally injured the commerce\r\nand impaired the revenues of New Spain. Accordingly the ministers in\r\nMadrid negotiated a treaty with Charles II. of England, by which the\r\nsovereigns of the two nations pledged themselves not to permit their\r\nsubjects to trade in their colonies. Notwithstanding the treaty,\r\nhowever, Governor Lynch, of Jamaica, still allowed the equipment of\r\nprivateers and smugglers, in his island, where they were furnished\r\nwith the necessary papers; but the king removed him as soon as he was\r\napprised of the fact, and replaced the conniving official by a more\r\ndiscreet and conscientious governor. Nevertheless the privateers and\r\npirates still continued their voyages, believing that this act of the\r\nBritish government was not intended in good faith to suppress their\r\nadventures, but simply to show Spain that _in England_ treaties were\r\nregarded as religiously binding upon the state and the people. They\r\ndid not imagine that the new governor would, finally, enforce the\r\nstringent laws against them. But this personage permitted the outlaws\r\nto finish their voyages without interference on the high seas, and the\r\nmoment some of them _landed_, they were hanged, as an example to all\r\nwho were still willing to set laws and treaties at defiance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1670, the prolonged Tarahumaric war was brought to a close, by\r\nNicolas Barraza. An Indian girl pointed out the place in which the\r\nmajority of the warriors might be surprised; and, all the passes being\r\nspeedily seized and guarded, three hundred captives fell into the\r\nvictors' hands. In 1673, the viceroy departed for Spain, after an\r\nunusually long and quiet reign of eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO NUÑO COLON DE PORTUGAL, DUKE OF VERAGUAS AND KNIGHT OF THE\r\nGOLDEN FLEECE, XXVI. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1673.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of this distinguished nobleman and descendant of the\r\ndiscoverer of America, was unquestionably designed merely as a\r\ncompliment to the memory of a man, whose genius had given a new world\r\nto Castile.[43] He was so far advanced in life, that it was scarcely\r\npresumed he would be able to withstand the hardships of the voyage or\r\nreach the Mexican metropolis. And such, indeed, was the result of his\r\ntoilsome journey. His baton of office,--assumed on the 8th of\r\nDecember, 1673,--fell from his decrepit hand on the 13th of the same\r\nmonth. So sure was the Spanish court that the viceroy would not long\r\nsurvive his arrival, that it had already appointed his successor, and\r\nsent a sealed despatch with the commission, which was to be opened in\r\nthe event of Don Pedro's death. It thus happened that the funeral of\r\none viceroy, was presided over by his successor; and the august\r\nceremonial was doubtless more solemn from the fact that this successor\r\nwas Rivera, who, at that time, was the archbishop of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Veraguas of course neither originated any thing nor\r\ncompleted any public work that had been already commenced; but the\r\ncompanions of his voyage to America, long remembered and spoke of the\r\ngood will and wise measures which he constantly manifested in\r\nconversation relative to the government of New Spain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43:\r\n\r\n      \"A Castilla y a Leon,\r\n      \"Mundo nuebo dio Colon,\"\r\n\r\nis the motto attached to the arms of this house.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1674-1696.\r\n\r\n    RIVERA VICEROY.--LA CERDA VICEROY.--REVOLT IN NEW MEXICO.--SUCCESS\r\n    OF THE INDIANS.--COLONY DESTROYED.--EFFORTS OF THE SPANIARDS TO\r\n    RECONQUER.--VERA CRUZ SACKED.--COUNT MONCLOVA VICEROY.--COUNT\r\n    GALVE VICEROY.--TARRAHUMARIC REVOLT.--INDIANS PACIFIED.--TEXAS.--\r\n    HISPANIOLA ATTACKED.--INSURRECTION--BURNING OF THE PALACE.--\r\n    FAMINE--EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAY PAYO ENRIQUEZ DE RIVERA, ARCHBISHOP OF MEXICO, XXVII. VICEROY OF\r\nNEW SPAIN. 1674-1680.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Veraguas, as we have seen, enjoyed none of his viceroyal\r\nhonors save those which crowned his entrance into the capital; and as\r\nsoon as his remains were temporarily interred in the cathedral, Fray\r\nPayo Enriquez de Rivera assumed the reins of government.\r\n\r\nThis excellent prelate had fulfilled the functions of his bishopric,\r\nfor nine years, in Guatemala, so satisfactorily to the masses, that\r\nhis elevation to supreme power in Mexico was hailed as a national\r\nblessing. He devoted himself from the first, diligently, to the\r\nadornment of the capital and the just and impartial administration of\r\npublic affairs. He improved the roads and entrances into the city;\r\nand, by his moderation, justice and mildness, united with liberality\r\nand economy, raised the reputation of his government to such a degree\r\nof popular favor that, in the annals of New Spain, it is referred to\r\nas a model public administration.\r\n\r\nIn 1677, by the orders of the queen regent, Rivera, despatched a\r\ncolony to California; and in the following year, Charles II., who had\r\nattained his majority, signified his gratitude to the viceroy for his\r\npaternal government of New Spain, as well as for the care he had\r\nshown not only for the social, artistical and political improvement of\r\nthe nation committed to his charge, but for the honest collection of\r\nthe royal income, which, in those days, was a matter of no small\r\nmoment or interest to the Spanish kings. But in 1680, the viceroy's\r\nhealth began to fail, and Charles the Second, who still desired to\r\npreserve and secure the invaluable services of so excellent a\r\npersonage to his country, nominated him bishop of Cuenca, and created\r\nhim president of the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON TOMAS ANTONIO MANRIQUE DE LA CERDA, MARQUES DE LA LAGUNA, XXVIII.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1680-1686.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop Rivera, when he left the viceroyal chair handed to his\r\nsuccessor in 1680, on the 30th of November, the letter he had just\r\nreceived from the north, imparting the sad news of a general rising of\r\nthe Indians in New Mexico against the Spaniards. The aborigines of\r\nthat region, who then amounted to about twenty-five thousand, residing\r\nin twenty-four villages, had entered into combination with the wilder\r\ntribes thronging the broad plains of the north and the recesses of the\r\nneighboring mountains, and had suddenly descended, in great force,\r\nupon the unfortunate Spaniards scattered through the country. The\r\nsecret of the conspiracy was well kept until the final moment of\r\nrupture. The spirit of discontent, and the bond of Indian union were\r\nfostered and strengthened, silently, steadily and gradually,\r\nthroughout a territory of one hundred and twenty-five leagues in\r\nextent, without the revelation of the fact to any of the foreigners in\r\nthe region. Nor did the strangers dream of impending danger until the\r\n10th of August, when, at the same moment, the various villages of\r\nIndians, took arms against the Spaniards, and, slaughtering all who\r\nwere not under the immediate protection of garrisons, even wreaked\r\ntheir vengeance upon twenty-one Franciscan monks who had labored for\r\nthe improvement of their social condition as well as for their\r\nconversion to Christianity.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully assaulted all the outposts of this remote\r\ngovernment of New Spain, the Indians next directed their arms against\r\nthe capital, Santa Fé, which was the seat of government and the\r\nresidence of the wealthiest and most distinguished inhabitants of the\r\nnorth. But the garrison was warned in time by a few natives who still\r\nremained faithful to their foreign task-masters, and was thus enabled\r\nto muster its forces and to put its arms in order, so as to receive\r\nthe meditated assault. The Spanish soldiers allowed the rebellious\r\nconspirators to approach their defences, until they were sure of their\r\naim, and, then, discharging their pieces upon the impetuous masses,\r\ncovered the fields with dead and wounded. But the brave Indians were\r\ntoo excited, resolved and numerous to be stayed or repulsed by the\r\nfeeble garrison. New auxiliaries took the places of the slaughtered\r\nranks. On all sides, the country was dark with crowds of dusky\r\nwarriors whose shouts and warwhoops continually rent the air. Clouds\r\nof arrows, and showers of stones were discharged on the heads of the\r\nbeleagured townsmen. No man dared show himself beyond the covering of\r\nhouses and parapets; and thus, for ten days, the Indian siege was\r\nunintermitted for a single moment around the walls of Santa Fé. At the\r\nexpiration of this period the provisions as well as the munitions of\r\nthe Spaniards were expended, and the wretched inhabitants, who could\r\nno longer endure the stench from the carcasses of the slain which lay\r\nin putrefying heaps around their town, resolved to evacuate the\r\nuntenable place. Accordingly, under cover of the night, they contrived\r\nto elude the besiegers' vigilance, and quitting the town by secret and\r\nlonely paths, they fled to Paso del Norte, whence they despatched\r\nmessengers to the viceroy with the news of their misfortune. The day\r\nafter this precipitate retreat, the Indians, who were altogether\r\nunaware of the Spaniards' departure, expected a renewal of the combat.\r\nBut the town was silent. Advancing cautiously from house to house and\r\nstreet to street, they saw that Santa Fé was, in reality deserted;\r\nand, content with having driven their oppressors from the country,\r\nthey expended their wrath upon the town by destroying and burning the\r\nbuildings. The cause of this rising was the bad conduct of the\r\nSpaniards to the Indians and the desire of these wilder northern\r\ntribes to regain their natural rights.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of 1681, the viceroy began to fear that this\r\nrebellion, which seemed so deeply rooted and so well organized, would\r\nspread throughout the neighboring provinces, and, accordingly,\r\ndespatched various squadrons of soldiers to New Mexico, and ordered\r\nlevies to join them as they marched to the north towards El Paso del\r\nNorte, which was the present refuge of the expelled and flying\r\ngovernment. In this place all the requisite preparations for a\r\ncampaign were diligently prepared, and thence the troops departed in\r\nquest of the headstrong rebels. But all their pains and efforts were\r\nfruitless. The object of the Indians seems to have been accomplished\r\nin driving off the Spaniards and destroying their settlements. The\r\nwild children of the soil and of the forest neither desired the\r\npossession of their goods, nor waged war in order to enjoy the estates\r\nthey had been forced to till. It was a simple effort to recover once\r\nmore the wild liberty of which they had been deprived, and to\r\noverthrow the masked slavery to which the more ennervated races of the\r\nsouth _submitted tamely_, under the controlling presence of ampler\r\nforces. They contented themselves, therefore, with destroying towns,\r\nplantations, farms, and villages, and, flying to the fastnesses of the\r\nmountain forests, either kept out of reach of the military bands that\r\ntraversed the country or descended in force upon detached parties. The\r\nSpaniards were thus denied all opportunity to make a successful\r\nmilitary demonstration against the Indians; and, after waiting a\r\nseason in fruitless efforts to subdue the natives, they retired to El\r\nPaso, leaving the country still in the possession of their foes who\r\nwould neither fight nor come to terms, although an unconditional\r\npardon and a future security of rights were freely promised.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful expedition of the previous year, induced the viceroy,\r\nin 1682, to adopt other means for the reduction of the refractory\r\nIndians to obedience. That vast region was not to be lost, nor were\r\nthe few inhabitants who still continued to reside on its frontiers, to\r\nbe abandoned to the mercy of savages. The Marques de la Laguna,\r\ntherefore resolved to re-colonize Santa Fé, and, accordingly,\r\ndespatched three hundred families of Spaniards and mulattoes, among\r\nwhom he divided the land by _caballerias_. Besides this, he augmented\r\nthe garrison in all the forts and strongholds scattered throughout the\r\nterritory, so that agriculture and trade, grouped under the guns of\r\nhis soldiery, might once more lift up their heads in that remote\r\nregion in spite of Indian hostility. This measure was of great service\r\nin controlling the natives elsewhere. The Indians in the neighboring\r\nprovinces had begun to exhibit a strong desire to imitate the example\r\nof the New Mexican bands, and, in all probability, were only prevented\r\nby this stringent measure of the viceroy from freeing themselves from\r\nthe Spanish yoke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Marques de la Laguna was an unfortunate one\r\nfor his peace if not for his fame. The expedition which he despatched\r\nin 1683 to California, under Don Isidro Otondo, and in which were\r\nJesuits among whom was the celebrated Father Kino, returned from that\r\ncountry three years afterwards after a fruitless voyage and\r\nexploration of the coasts. Nor was the eastern coast of New Spain more\r\ngrateful for the cares of the viceroy. Vera Cruz, the chief port of\r\nthe realm, was, at this time, warmly besieged and finally sacked by\r\nthe English pirate Nicholas Agramont, who was drawn thither by a\r\nmulatto, Lorencellio, after taking refuge in Jamaica for a crime that\r\nhe had committed in New Spain. On the 17th of May, Vera Cruz,\r\nsurrendered to the robbers, who possessed themselves of property to\r\nthe amount of seven millions of dollars, which was awaiting the\r\narrival in the harbor of the fleet that was to carry it to Spain. The\r\nchief portion of the inhabitants took sanctuary in the churches, where\r\nthey remained pent up for a length of time; but the pirates contrived\r\nto seize a large number of clergymen, monks and women, whom they\r\nforced to bear the spoils of the city to their vessels, and afterwards\r\ntreated with the greatest inhumanity.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Mexico were, at this period, sorely harassed with the\r\npiratical vessels of France and England. The wealth of the New World,\r\ninadequately protected by Spanish cruisers, in its transit to Europe,\r\nwas a tempting prize to the bold nautical adventurers of the north of\r\nEurope; and the advantages of the Spanish colonies were thus reaped by\r\nnations who were freed from the expenses of colonial possessions.\r\nThere are perhaps still many families in these countries whose\r\nfortunes were founded upon the robbery of Castilian galeons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON MELCHOR PORTOCARRERO LASO DE LA VEGA, COUNT DE LA MONCLOVA. XXIX.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1686-1688.\r\n\r\nThe Conde de Monclova, surnamed \"Brazo de Plata\" from the fact that he\r\nsupplied with a silver arm the member he had lost in battle, arrived\r\nin Mexico on the 30th of November, 1686, and immediately devoted\r\nhimself to the improvement of the capital, the completion of the canal\r\nwhich was to free the city from inundations, and the protection of the\r\nnorthern provinces and the coasts of the gulf against the menaced\r\nsettlements of the French. He despatched several Spanish men of war\r\nand launches to scour the harbors and inlets of the eastern shores,\r\nas far as Florida, in order to dislodge the intruders; and, having\r\nobtained control over the Indians of Coahuila he established a strong\r\ngarrison, and founded a colonial settlement, called the town of\r\nMonclova, with a hundred and fifty families, in which there were two\r\nhundred and seventy men capable of bearing arms against the French\r\nwhom he expected to encounter in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Conde de Monclova contemplated various plans for the consolidation\r\nand advancement of New Spain, but before two years had expired he was\r\nrelieved from the government and transferred to the viceroyalty of Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON GASPAR DE SANDOVAL SILVA Y MENDOZA, COUNT DE GALVE. XXX. VICEROY\r\nOF NEW SPAIN. 1688.\r\n\r\nThe Conde de Galve entered upon his government on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, 1688; and even before the departure of his predecessor for\r\nPeru, he learned that the fears of that functionary had been realized\r\nby the discovery of attempts by the French to found settlements in New\r\nSpain. The governor of Coahuila in the course of his explorations in\r\nthe wilderness found a fort which had been commenced, and the remains\r\nof a large number of dead Frenchmen, who had no doubt been engaged in\r\nthe erection of the stronghold when they fell under the blows and\r\narrows of the savages.\r\n\r\nBesides this intrusion in the north, from which the Spaniards were,\r\nnevertheless, somewhat protected by the Indians who hated the French\r\nquite as much as they did the subjects of Spain,--the viceroy heard,\r\nmoreover, that the Tarrahumare and Tepehuane tribes had united with\r\nother wild bands of the north-west, and were in open rebellion. Forces\r\nwere immediately despatched against the insurgents, but they fared no\r\nbetter than the Spanish troops had done in previous years in New\r\nMexico. The love of liberty, or the desire of entire freedom from\r\nlabor, was in this case, as in the former, the sole cause of the\r\ninsurrection. When the blow was struck, the Indians fled to their\r\nfastnesses, and when the regular soldiery arrived on the field to\r\nfight them according to the regular laws of war, the children of the\r\nforest were, as usual, no where to be found! Nor is it likely that the\r\nrebellion would have been easily suppressed, or improbable that those\r\nprovinces would have been lost, had not the Jesuits, who enjoyed\r\nconsiderable influence over the insurgent tribes, devoted themselves,\r\nforthwith, to calming the excited bands. Among the foremost of these\r\nclerical benefactors of Spain was the noble Milanese Jesuit,\r\nSalvatierra, whose authority over the Indians was perhaps paramount to\r\nall others, and whose successful zeal was acknowledged by a grateful\r\nletter from the viceroy. This worthy priest had been one of the ablest\r\nmissionaries among these warlike tribes. He won their love and\r\nconfidence whilst endeavoring to diffuse christianity among them, and\r\nthe power he obtained through his humanity and unvarying goodness, was\r\nnow the means of once more subjecting the revolted Indians to the\r\nSpaniards. The cross achieved a victory which they refused to the sword.\r\n\r\nIn 1690, another effort was made to populate California, in virtue of\r\nnew orders received from Charles; and, whilst the preparations were\r\nmaking to carry the royal will into effect, the viceroy commanded the\r\ngovernor of Coahuila to place a garrison at San Bernardo, where the\r\nFrench attempted to build their fort. Orders were also sent about the\r\nsame time by Galve to extend the Spanish power northward, and, in\r\n1691, the province of Asinais, or Texas, as it was called by the\r\nSpaniards, was settled by some emigrants, and visited by fourteen\r\nFranciscan monks, who were anxious to devote themselves to the\r\nconversion of the Indians. A garrison and a mission were established,\r\nat that time, in Texas; but in consequence, not only of an\r\nextraordinary drought which occurred two or three years after,\r\ndestroying the crops and the cattle, but also of a sudden rebellion\r\namong the natives against the Spaniards who desired to subject them to\r\nthe same ignoble toils that were patiently endured by the southern\r\ntribes, nearly all the posts and missions were immediately abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe year 1690 was signalized in the annals of New Spain by an attack\r\nand successful onslaught made by the orders of the viceroy with Creole\r\ntroops upon the island of Hispaniola, which was occupied by the\r\nFrench. Six ships of the line and a frigate, with two thousand seven\r\nhundred soldiers, sailed from the port of Vera Cruz, upon this warlike\r\nmission; and after fighting a decisive battle and destroying the\r\nsettlements upon parts of the island, but without attacking the more\r\nthickly peopled and better defended districts of the west, they\r\nreturned to New Spain with a multitude of prisoners and some booty.\r\n\r\nBut the rejoicings to which these victories gave rise were of short\r\nduration. The early frosts of 1691 had injured the crops, and the\r\ncountry was menaced with famine. On the 9th of June, in this year, the\r\nrain fell in torrents, and, accompanied as it was by hail, destroyed\r\nthe grain that was cultivated not only around the capital, but also in\r\nmany of the best agricultural districts. The roads became impassable,\r\nand many parts of the city of Mexico were inundated by floods from the\r\nlake, which continued to lie in the low level streets until the end of\r\nthe year. Every effort was made by the authorities to supply the\r\npeople with corn,--the staff of life among the lower classes,--and\r\ncommissaries were even despatched to the provinces to purchase grain\r\nwhich might be stored and sold to the masses at reasonable prices. But\r\nthe suspicious multitude did not justly regard this provident and\r\nhumane act. They imagined that the viceroy and his friends designed to\r\nprofit by the scarcity of food, and to enrich themselves by the misery\r\nof the country. Accordingly, loud murmurs of discontent arose among\r\nthe lower classes in the capital, and on the 8th of June, 1692, the\r\nexcited mob rushed suddenly to the palace of the viceroy, and setting\r\nfire not only to it but to the Casa de Cabildo and the adjacent\r\nbuildings, destroyed that splendid edifice together with most of the\r\narchives, records and historical documents which had been preserved\r\nsince the settlement of the country. A diligent search was made for\r\nthe authors of this atrocious calamity, and eight persons were tried,\r\nconvicted and executed for the crime. The wretched incendiaries were\r\nfound among the dregs of the people. Many of their accomplices were\r\nalso found guilty and punished with stripes; and the viceroy took\r\nmeasures to drive the hordes of skulking Indians who had been chiefly\r\nactive in the mob, from their haunts in the city, as well as to\r\ndeprive them of the intoxicating drinks, and especially their favorite\r\n_pulque_, in which they were habituated to indulge. The crop of 1693,\r\nin some degree, repaired the losses of previous years, and in the\r\nensuing calm the Conde de Galve commenced the rebuilding of the\r\nviceroyal palace. The property destroyed in the conflagration in June,\r\n1692, amounted in value to at least three millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this year, the viceroy, who was anxious for the protection of the\r\nnorthern shores of the gulf, and desirous to guard the territory of\r\nFlorida, from the invasion or settlement of the northern nations of\r\nEurope, fitted out an expedition of expert engineers to Pensacola, who\r\ndesigned and laid the foundations of the fortifications of this\r\nimportant port. Three years afterwards, before the termination of his\r\ncommand in New Spain, Galve had the satisfaction to despatch from Vera\r\nCruz the colony and garrison which were to occupy and defend this\r\nstronghold.\r\n\r\nIn 1694, the capital and the adjacent province were once more\r\nafflicted with scarcity, and to this was added the scourge of an\r\nepidemic that carried thousands to the grave. In the following year a\r\ndreadful earthquake shook the city of Mexico, on the night of the 24th\r\nof August, and at seven o'clock of the following morning. But amid all\r\nthese afflictions, which were regarded by multitudes as specially sent\r\nby the hand of God to punish the people for their sins, the\r\nauthorities managed to preserve order throughout the country, and in\r\n1695, sent large reinforcements for the expedition which the English\r\nand Spaniards united in fitting out against the French who still\r\nmaintained their hold on the island of Hispaniola. This adventure was\r\nperfectly successful. The combined forces assaulted the Gauls with\r\nextraordinary energy, and bore off eighty-one cannons as trophies of\r\ntheir victorious descent. The checquered administration of the Conde\r\nde Galve was thus satisfactorily terminated, and he returned to Spain\r\nafter eight years of government, renowned for the equity and prudence\r\nof his administration during a period of unusual peril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1696-1734.\r\n\r\n    MONTAÑEZ VICEROY.--SPIRITUAL CONQUEST OF CALIFORNIA.--VALLADARES\r\n    VICEROY.--FAIR AT ACAPULCO.--SPANISH MONARCHY--AUSTRIA--BOURBON.--\r\n    MONTAÑEZ VICEROY.--JESUITS IN CALIFORNIA.--LA CUEVA VICEROY.--DUKE\r\n    DE LINARES VICEROY.--BRITISH SLAVERY TREATY.--COLONIZATION.

VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1696-1702.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Galve departed, and the new episcopal viceroy Montañez\r\nassumed the reins of government, on the 27th of February, 1696, when\r\nnews reached Mexico that a French squadron was laying in wait near\r\nHavana, to seize the galeons which were to leave Vera Cruz in the\r\nspring for Spain. The fleet was accordingly ordered to delay its\r\ndeparture until the summer, whilst masses were said and prayers\r\naddressed to the miraculous image of the Virgin of Remedios to protect\r\nthe vessels and their treasure from disaster. The failure of the fleet\r\nto sail at the appointed day seems to have caused the French squadron\r\nto depart for Europe, after waiting a considerable time to effect\r\ntheir piratical enterprise; and, in the end, all the galeons, save\r\none, reached the harbor of Cadiz, where the duties alone on their\r\nprecious freights amounted to four hundred and twelve thousand dollars!\r\n\r\nAt this period the settlement of the Californias, which was always a\r\nfavorite project among the Mexicans, began again to be agitated. The\r\ncoasts had been constantly visited by adventurers engaged in the pearl\r\nfishery; but these persons, whose manners were not conciliatory, and\r\nwhose purposes were altogether selfish, did not contribute to\r\nstrengthen the ties between the Spaniards and the natives. Indeed, the\r\nIndians continually complained of the fishermen's ill usage, and were\r\nunwilling to enter either into trade or friendship with so wild a\r\nclass of unsettled visitors. The colonial efforts, previously made,\r\nhad failed in consequence of the scarcity of supplies, nor could\r\nsufficient forces be spared to compel the submission of the large and\r\nsavage tribes that dwelt in those remote regions. Accordingly, when\r\nthe worthy Father Salvatierra, moved by the descriptions of Father\r\nKino, prayed the Audiencia to intrust the reduction of the Californias\r\nto the care of the Jesuits, who would undertake it without supplies\r\nfrom the royal treasury, that body and the episcopal viceroy,\r\nconsented to the proposed spiritual conquest, and imposed on the holy\r\nfather no other conditions except that the effort should be made\r\nwithout cost to Spain, and that the territory subdued should be taken\r\npossession of in the name of Charles II. Besides this concession to\r\nthe Jesuits, the viceroy and Audiencia granted to Salvatierra and Kino\r\nthe right to levy troops and name commanders for their protection in\r\nthe wilderness. A few days after the conclusion of this contract with\r\nthe zealous missionaries, the government of Montañez was terminated by\r\nthe arrival of his successor, the Conde de Montezuma.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JOSÉ SARMIENTO VALLADARES, COUNT DE MONTEZUMA Y TULA XXXII.\r\nVICEROY OF MEXICO. 1696-1702.\r\n\r\nThe Conde de Montezuma arrived in Mexico on the 18th of December,\r\n1696. Early in the ensuing January the annual galeon from the\r\nPhilipine islands reached the port of Acapulco, and this year the\r\nadvent of the vessel, laden with oriental products seems to have been\r\nthe motive for the assemblage of people not only from all parts of\r\nMexico, but even from Peru, at a fair, at which nearly two millions of\r\ndollars were spent by inhabitants of the latter viceroyalty in\r\nmerchandise from China. Hardly had the festivities of this universal\r\nconcourse ended when a violent earthquake shook the soil of New Spain,\r\nand extended from the west coast to the interior beyond the capital,\r\nin which the inhabitants were suffering from scarcity, and beginning\r\nalready to exhibit symptoms of discontent, as they had done five years\r\nbefore, against the supreme authorities, who they always accused of\r\ncriminally withholding grain or maintaining its exorbitant price\r\nwhenever the seasons were inauspicious. But the Conde de Montezuma was\r\non his guard, and immediately took means to control the Indians and\r\nlower classes who inhabited the suburbs of the capital. In the\r\nmeanwhile he caused large quantities of corn to be sent to Mexico from\r\nthe provinces, and, as long as the scarcity continued and until it was\r\nascertained that the new crop would be abundant, he ordered grain to\r\nbe served out carefully to those who were really in want or unable to\r\nsupply themselves at the prices of the day.[44]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1698 the joyful news of the peace concluded in the preceding year\r\nbetween France, Spain, Holland and England, reached Mexico, and gave\r\nrise to unusual rejoicings among the people. Commerce, which had\r\nsuffered greatly from the war, recovered its wonted activity. The two\r\nfollowing years passed over New Spain uneventfully; but the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century was signalized by a matter which not only\r\naffected the politics of Europe, but might have interfered essentially\r\nwith the loyalty and prosperity of the New World.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1701, the monarchy of Spain passed from the house of Austria to\r\nthat of Bourbon. The history of this transition of the crown, and of\r\nthe conflicts to which it gave rise not only in Spain but throughout\r\nEurope, is well known at the present day. Yet America does not appear\r\nto have been shaken in its fidelity, amid all the convulsions of the\r\nparent state. Patient, submissive and obedient to the authorities sent\r\nthem from across the sea, the people of Mexico were as willing to\r\nreceive a sovereign of a new race, as to hail the advent in their\r\ncapital of a new viceroy. Accordingly the inhabitants immediately\r\nmanifested their fealty to the successor named by Charles II., a fact\r\nwhich afforded no small degree of consolation to Philip V. during all\r\nthe vicissitudes of his fortune. It is even related that this monarch\r\nthought at one period of taking refuge among his American subjects,\r\nand thus relieving himself of the quarrels and conflicts by which he\r\nwas surrounded and assailed in Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe public mourning and funeral obsequies for the late sovereign were\r\ncelebrated in Mexico with great pomp according to a precise ritual\r\nwhich was sent from the Spanish court, and, whilst the people were\r\nthinking of the festivities which were to signalize Philip's accession\r\nto the throne, the Conde de Montezuma returned to Spain after four\r\nyears of uneventful rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN DE ORTEGA MONTAÑEZ, ARCHBISHOP OF MEXICO, HIS SECOND\r\nVICEROYALTY. XXXIII. VICEROY OF MEXICO. 1701-1702.\r\n\r\nThe brief period during which the archiepiscopal viceroy exercised his\r\nfunctions in Mexico for the second time, is chiefly, and perhaps,\r\nonly, memorable, for the additional efforts made by the worthy Jesuits\r\nin California to subdue and settle that distant province. The\r\ncolonists and clergymen who had already gone thither complained\r\nincessantly of their sufferings in consequence of the sterility of the\r\ncoasts. But Salvatierra remained firm in his resolution to spread the\r\npower of Spain and of his church among the wild tribes at the feet of\r\nthe western sierra along the Pacific coast. His labors and those of\r\nhis diligent coadjutors were slow but incessant. Trusting confidently\r\nin Providence, they maintained their post at the Presidio of Loreto,\r\nand gathered around them, by their persuasive eloquence and gentle\r\ndemeanor, large numbers of natives, until the success of their\r\nteachings threatened them with starvation in consequence of the\r\nabundance of their converts, all of whom relied upon the fathers for\r\nmaintenance as soon as they abandoned their savage life. Yet there was\r\nno other means of attaching the Indians to the Spanish government. The\r\nauthorities in Mexico had refused and continued obstinate in their\r\ndenial of men or money to conquer or hold the country; so that, after\r\nvarious efforts to obtain the aid of the government, the pious\r\nmendicants resolved to return again to their remote missions with no\r\nother reliance than honest zeal and the support of God. At this\r\njuncture Philip V., and a number of influential people in the capital,\r\nvolunteered to aid the cause of christianity _and_ Spain, by supplies\r\nwhich would ensure the final success of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ DE LA CUEVA, DUQUE DE ALBURQUERQUE. XXXIV.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1702-1709.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Duke of Alburquerque assumed the government of Mexico,\r\nhe perceived that more than ordinary care was necessary to consolidate\r\na loyal alliance between the throne and its American possessions,\r\nduring the dangerous period in which portions of Spain, in the old\r\nworld, were armed and aroused against the lawful authorities of the\r\nland. Accordingly the new viceroy immediately strengthened the\r\nmilitary arm of the colony, and extended the government of provinces\r\nand the custody of his strongholds and fastnesses to Spaniards upon\r\nwhose fidelity he could implicitly rely. Without these precautions,\r\nhe, perhaps, justly feared that notwithstanding the loyalty manifested\r\nin New Spain upon the accession of Philip, the insubordination of\r\ncertain parts of the Spanish monarchy, at home, might serve as a bad\r\nexample to the American colonists, and, finally, result in a civil war\r\nthat would drench the land with blood. Besides this, the foreign\r\nfleets and pirates were again beginning to swarm along the coasts,\r\nlying in wait for the treasure which was annually despatched to Spain;\r\nbut to meet and control these adventurers, the careful duke increased\r\nthe squadron of Barlovento, who was instructed to watch the coast\r\nincessantly, and to lose no opportunity to make prizes of the enemy's\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nPeace was thus preserved in New Spain both on land and water, whilst\r\nthe Jesuits of California still continued their efforts, unaided by\r\nthe government, whose resources were drained for the wars of the old\r\nworld. Thus, after eight years of a strong but pacific reign, during\r\nwhich he saved New Spain from imitating the disgraceful dissensions of\r\nthe parent state, the Duke of Alburquerque resigned his government\r\ninto the hands of the Duke of Linares.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON FERNANDO ALCENCASTRE NOROÑA Y SILVA, DUKE DE LINARES, XXXV.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1710-1716.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Linares entered Mexico in 1710. The first years of his\r\nadministration were uneventful, nor was his whole government\r\ndistinguished, in fact, by any matter which will make it particularly\r\nmemorable in the history of New Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, Philip V. found himself master of nearly the whole of Spain,\r\nand being naturally anxious to end the war with honor, his emmissaries\r\nimproved every opportunity to withdraw members of the combined powers\r\nfrom a contest which threatened to be interminable. Accordingly, he\r\napproached the English with the temptations of trade, and through his\r\nambassadors who were assisting at the congress of Utrecht, he proposed\r\nthat the British Queen Anne should withdraw from the contest, if he\r\ngranted her subjects the right to establish trading houses in his\r\nports on the main and in the islands, for the purpose of supplying the\r\ncolonies with African slaves. A similar contract had been made ten\r\nyears before with the French, and was about to expire on the 1st of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nAnne, who was wearied of the war and was glad to escape from its\r\nexpense and danger, was not loath to accept the proffered terms; and\r\nthe treaty, known by the name of _El Asiento_, which was put in force\r\nin Vera Cruz and other Spanish ports, resulted most beneficially to\r\nthe English. They filled the markets with negroes, and, at the same\r\ntime, continued to reap profit from the goods they smuggled into the\r\ncolonies, notwithstanding the treaty forbade the introduction of\r\nBritish merchandise to the detriment of Spanish manufactures. This\r\ncombined inhumane and illicit trade continued for a considerable time,\r\nuntil the authorities were obliged to menace the officers of customs\r\nwith death if they connived any longer at the secret and scandalous\r\nintroduction of British wares.\r\n\r\nIn 1714, a brief famine and severe epidemic again ravaged the colony.\r\nIn this year, too, the Indians of Texas once more manifested a desire\r\nto submit themselves to Spain and to embrace the christian faith.\r\nOrders were, therefore, given to garrison that northern province, and\r\nthe Franciscan monks were again commanded to return to their missions\r\namong the Ansinais. At the same time, a new colony was founded in\r\nNuevo Leon, forty leagues south-east from Monterey, which, in honor of\r\nthe viceroy received the name of San Felipe de Linares. At the close\r\nof this year, 1715, the garrisons of Texas were already completed, and\r\nthe Franciscan friars busy in their mission of inducing the savages to\r\nabandon their nomadic habits for the quieter life of villagers. This\r\nwas always the most successful effort of the Spaniards in controlling\r\nthe restless wanderers and hunters of the wilderness. It was the first\r\nstep in the modified civilization that usually ended in a mere\r\nknowledge of the formula of prayers which was called christianity, and\r\nin the more substantial labor of the Indians which was in reality\r\nnothing but slavery.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The year 1711, is remarkable in the annals of the valley of\r\n    Mexico for a _snow storm_, which is only known to have occurred\r\n    again on the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin in 1767. In\r\n    August of 1711, there was an awful earthquake, which shattered the\r\n    city and destroyed many of its strongest houses.\r\n\r\nThe year 1716 was the last of the reign of the Duke of Linares, who in\r\nthe month of August resigned his post to the Duke of Arion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON BALTAZAR DE ZUÑIGA GUZMAN, SOTOMAYOR Y MENDOZA, DUKE DE ARION AND\r\nMARQUES DE VALERO. XXXVI. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1716-1722.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Duke de Arion taken charge of the viceroyal\r\ngovernment, when he received an express from Texas, despatched by\r\nDomingo Ramon, who was captain of the Spaniards in the province,\r\ninforming the authorities of the famine which prevailed throughout his\r\ncommand, and demanding supplies, without which, he would be obliged to\r\nabandon his post and take refuge with his soldiers in Coahuila. The\r\nnew viceroy saw at once the importance of preserving this province as\r\nan outpost and frontier against the French who had already begun their\r\nsettlements in Louisiana, and accordingly he commanded the governor of\r\nCoahuila to send provisions and troops to Texas, together with\r\nmechanics who should teach the useful arts to the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhile these occurrences took place in the north of Mexico, war was once\r\nmore declared between Spain and France without any apparent motive save\r\nthe hatred which the Duke of Orleans, the regent during the minority of\r\nLouis XV., entertained for the Cardinal Alberoni who was prime minister\r\nof Spain and had intrigued to dispossess him of his regency. The news of\r\nthis war reached New Spain, and on the 19th of May, 1719, the French\r\nattacked Pensacola and received the capitulation of the governor, who\r\nwas unprepared, either with men or provisions to resist the invaders. In\r\nthe following month the garrison and missionaries of Texas returned\r\nhastily to Coahuila, and apprised the viceroy of their flight for\r\nsafety. But that functionary saw at once the necessity of strengthening\r\nthe frontier. Levies were, therefore, immediately made. Munitions were\r\ndespatched to the north. And five hundred men, divided into eight\r\ncompanies, marched forthwith to re-establish the garrisons and missions\r\nunder the command of the Marques San Miguel de Aguayo, the new governor\r\nof Florida and Texas.[45]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the hostilities between France and Spain, and the\r\neager watchfulness of the fleets and privateers of the former nations,\r\nthe galeons of New Spain, reached Cadiz in 1721, with a freight of\r\neleven millions of dollars! The years 1722 and 1723 were signalized by\r\nsome outbreaks among the Indians which were successfully quelled by\r\nthe colonial troops; and, in October, the Duke of Arion, who had\r\ncontrolled New Spain for six years, was succeeded by the Marques of\r\nCasa-Fuerte, a general of artillery. He entered Mexico amid the\r\napplauses of the people not only because he was a _creole_ or native\r\nof America, but for the love that was borne him by Philip the Fifth,\r\nwho well knew the services for which the crown was indebted to so\r\nbrave a warrior.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN DE ACUÑA, MARQUES DE CASA-FUERTE, XXXVII. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1722-1734.\r\n\r\nIn recording these brief memorials of the viceroys of Mexico it has\r\nbeen our purpose rather to mention the principal public events that\r\nsignalized their reigns, and developed or protected the nation\r\ncommitted to their charge, than to trace the intrigues or exhibit the\r\nmisconduct of those functionaries and their courtiers. We have\r\nabstained, therefore, from noticing many of the corrupt practices\r\nwhich crept into the administration of Mexico, leaving such matters to\r\nbe studied in the summary view we have presented of the colonial\r\ngovernment of Spain. But, in sketching the viceroyalty of the Marques\r\nde Casa-Fuerte, we cannot justly avoid observing the marked and moral\r\nchange he wrought in the government of the country, and the diligence\r\nwith which this brave and trusty soldier labored to purify the corrupt\r\ncourt of New Spain. Other viceroys had endeavored zealously to aid the\r\nprogress of the colony. They had planted towns, villages, and\r\ngarrisons throughout the interior. They had sought to develope the\r\nmining districts and to foster agricultural interests. But almost all\r\nof them were more or less tainted with avarice, and willingly fell\r\ninto the habits of the age, which countenanced the traffic in office,\r\nor permitted the reception of liberal \"gratifications\" whenever an\r\nadvantage was to be derived by an individual from his transactions\r\nwith the government.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Casa-Fuerte, there was no path to the palace but that\r\nwhich was open to all. Merit was the test of employment and reward. He\r\nforbade the members of his family to receive gifts or to become\r\nintercessors for office seekers; and, in all branches of public\r\naffairs, he introduced wholesome reforms which were carefully\r\nmaintained during the whole of his long and virtuous administration.\r\n\r\nIn 1724, Philip V. suddenly and unexpectedly for his American\r\nsubjects, resolved to abdicate the crown of Spain and raise his son\r\nLouis I. to the throne. Scarcely had the news reached Mexico, and\r\nwhile the inhabitants were about to celebrate the accession of the\r\nprince, when they learned that he was already dead, and that his\r\nfather, fearing to seat the minor Ferdinand in the place of his lost\r\nson, had again resumed the sceptre. The Marques de Casa-Fuerte,\r\ninstantly proclaimed the fact to the people, whose loyalty to the old\r\nsovereign continued unabated; and during the unusually long and\r\nsuccessful government of this viceroy, the greatest cordiality and\r\nconfidence was maintained between himself and his royal master.\r\n\r\nCasa-Fuerte despatched a colony of emigrants from the Canary Isles to\r\nTexas, and establishing a town for their occupation, he modestly\r\nrefused the proffered honor of bestowing upon it his name, but caused\r\nit to be called San Fernando, in honor of the heir of the Spanish\r\ncrown. Nor did he neglect commerce whilst he attended to a discreet\r\ncolonization in the north which might encounter and stay the southern\r\nprogress of the English and the French. In 1731, the oriental trade of\r\nNew Spain had become exceedingly important. The galeons that regularly\r\npassed across the Pacific, from the East Indies, and arrived every\r\nyear in America about Christmas, had enjoyed almost a monopoly of the\r\nIndian trade in consequence of the wars which continually existed\r\nduring that century and filled the northern and southern Atlantic with\r\npirates and vessels of war. The Pacific, however, was comparatively\r\nfree from these dangers, and the galeons were allowed to go and come\r\nwith but little interruption. The American creoles, in reality,\r\npreferred the manufactures of China to those of Europe; for the\r\nfabrics of silk and cotton, especially, which were sent to Mexico from\r\nAsia, had been sold at half the price demanded for similar articles\r\nproduced in Spain. The galeon of 1731, which discharged its cargo in\r\nAcapulco, bore a freight of unusual value, whence we may estimate the\r\nMexican commerce of that age. The duties collected upon this oriental\r\nmerchandise exceeded one hundred and seventy thousand dollars,\r\nexhibiting an extraordinary increase of eastern trade with Mexico,\r\ncompared with thirty-five years before, when the impost collected on\r\nsimilar commerce in 1697, amounted to but eighty thousand dollars. The\r\nanxiety to preserve the mercantile importance of Cadiz and to prevent\r\nthe ruin of the old world's commerce, interposed many difficulties in\r\nthe trade between the East Indies and New Spain; but the influence of\r\nSpanish houses in Manilla still secured the annual galeon, and the\r\nthrifty merchants stowed the vessels with nearly double the freight\r\nthat was carried by similar ships on ordinary voyages. Acapulco thus\r\nbecame the emporium of an important trade, and its streets were\r\ncrowded with merchants and strangers from all parts of Mexico in spite\r\nof the dangerous diseases with which they were almost sure to be\r\nattacked whilst visiting the western coast.\r\n\r\nThe year 1734 was a sad one for New Spain. The Marques de Casa-Fuerte,\r\nwho governed the country for twelve years most successfully, and had\r\nserved the crown for fifty-nine, departed this life, at the age of\r\nseventy-seven. He was a native of Lima, and like a true creole seems\r\nto have had the good of America constantly at heart. Philip V. fully\r\nappreciated his meritorious services, and, had the viceroy lived,\r\nwould doubtless have continued him longer in the government of Mexico.\r\nThe counsellors of the king often hinted to their sovereign that it\r\nwas time to remove the Mexican viceroy; but the only reply they\r\nreceived from Philip was \"_Long live Casa-Fuerte!_\" The courtiers\r\nanswered that they hoped he might, indeed, live long, but, that\r\noppressed with years and toils, he was no longer able to endure the\r\nburdens of so arduous a government. \"As long as Casa-Fuerte lives,\"\r\nanswered the king, \"his talents and virtues, will give him all the\r\nvigor required for a good minister.\"\r\n\r\nImpartial posterity has confirmed the sensibility and judgment of the\r\nking. During the reign of Casa-Fuerte the capital of New Spain was\r\nadorned with many of its most sumptuous and elegant edifices. The\r\nroyal mint and custom house were built under his orders. All the\r\ngarrisons throughout the viceroyalty were visited, examined, and\r\nreported. He was liberal with alms for the poor, and even left a sum\r\nto be distributed twice a year for food among the prisoners. He\r\nendowed an asylum for orphans; expended a large part of his fortune in\r\ncharitable works, and is still known in the traditionary history of\r\nthe country as the \"Great Governor of New Spain.\" His cherished\r\nremains were interred with great pomp, and are still preserved in the\r\nchurch of the Franciscans of San Cosmé and Damian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: In 1697 there was an eruption of the volcano of\r\nPopocatepetl, on the 29th of October.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: It may not be uninteresting or unprofitable to state in\r\nthis place some of the efforts at positive settlement in Texas which\r\nwere made by the Spaniards during the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Alarcon, the governor, early in 1718, crossed the Medina,\r\nwith a large number of soldiers, settlers and mechanics, and founded\r\nthe town of Bejar, with the fortress of San Antonio, and the mission\r\nof San Antonio Valero. Thence he pushed on to the country of the Cenis\r\nIndians, where, having strengthened the missionary force, he crossed\r\nthe river Adayes, which he called the Rio de San Francisco de Sabinas,\r\nor the Sabine, and began the foundation of a fortress, within a short\r\ndistance of the French fort, at Natchitoches, named by him the Presido\r\nde San Miguel Arcangel de Linares de Adayes. These establishments were\r\nreinforced during the next year, and another stronghold was erected on\r\nthe Oreoquisas, probably the San Jacinto, emptying into Galveston bay,\r\nwest of the mouth of the Trinity.\r\n\r\nThe French, who were not unobservant of these Spanish acts of occupation\r\nin a country they claimed by virtue of La Salle's discovery and\r\npossession in 1684, immediately began to establish counter-settlements,\r\non the Mississippi, and in the valley of the Red river. When Alarcon was\r\nremoved from the government of Texas he was succeeded by the Marques de\r\nAguayo, who made expeditions through the country in 1721 and 1722,\r\nduring which he considerably increased the Spanish establishments, and,\r\nafter this period, no attempt was ever made by the French to occupy any\r\nspot south-west of Natchitoches.

VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1734-1740.\r\n\r\nThis viceroy who governed New Spain from the year 1734 to 1740, passed\r\nan uneventful reign, so far as the internal peace and order of the\r\ncolony were concerned. War was declared, during this period, between\r\nFrance and Spain, but Mexico escaped from all its desolating\r\nconsequences, and nothing appears to have disturbed the quiet of\r\ncolonial life but a severe epidemic, which is said to have resembled\r\nthe yellow fever, and carried off many thousands of the inhabitants,\r\nespecially in the north-eastern section of the territory. The viceroy\r\nwas naturally solicitous to follow the example of his predecessors, in\r\npreventing the encroachments of the French on the northern indefinite\r\nboundaries of New Spain, and took measures to support the feeble\r\ngarrisons and colonies which were the only representatives of Spanish\r\nrights and power in that remote quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO CASTRO FIGUEROA SALAZAR, DUKE DE LA CONQUISTA AND MARQUES DE\r\nGARCIA-REAL, XXXIX. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1740-1741.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of August the new viceroy reached the capital, and learned\r\nfrom the governor of New Mexico that the French had actually visited\r\nthat region of the colonial possessions, yet, finding the soil and\r\ncountry unsuited to their purposes, had returned again to their own\r\nvillages and settlements. At the same time the English, under the\r\ncommand of Oglethrope, bombarded the town and fort of San Agustin in\r\nFlorida, but the brave defence made by the Spaniards, obliged them to\r\nraise the siege and depart.\r\n\r\nIn 1741 the sky of New Spain was obscured by the approaching clouds of\r\nwar, for Admiral Vernon, who had inflicted great damages upon the\r\ncommerce of the Indies, captured Porto Bello, and occupied the forts\r\nof Cartagena. New Spain, was thus in constant dread of the arrival of\r\na formidable enemy upon her own coasts; and the Duke de la Conquista,\r\nanxious for the fate of Vera Cruz, hastily levied an adequate force\r\nfor the protection of the shore along the gulf, and resolved to visit\r\nit personally in order to hasten the works which were requisite to\r\nresist the English. He departed for the eastern districts of New Spain\r\nupon the warlike mission, but, in the midst of his labors, was\r\nsuddenly seized by a severe illness which obliged him to return to the\r\ncapital, where he died on the 22d of August. His body was interred\r\nwith great pomp, amid the lamentations of the Mexicans, for in the\r\nbrief period of his government he had manifested talents of the\r\nhighest order, and exhibited the deepest interest in the welfare and\r\nprogress of the country committed to his charge. His noble title of\r\n\"Duke of Conquest,\" was bravely won on the battle field of Bitonto;\r\nand although it is said that Philip slighted him during the year of\r\nhis viceroyalty, yet it is certain that he was repaid by the\r\nadmiration of the Mexican people for the lost favor of his king. Upon\r\nhis death the Audiencia took charge of the government, and continued\r\nin power until the following November, without any serious disturbance\r\nfrom the enemy. Anson, with his vessels, was in the Pacific, and\r\nwaited anxiously in the neighborhood of Acapulco to make a prize of\r\nthe galeon which was to sail for the East Indies, laden with a rich\r\ncargo of silver to purchase oriental fabrics. But the inhabitants of\r\nAcapulco and the Audiencia were on their guard, and the vessel and\r\ntreasure of New Spain escaped the grasp of the English adventurer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO CEBRIAN Y AGUSTIN, COUNT DE FUEN-CLARA. XL. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1742-1746.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Fuen-Clara assumed the viceroyal baton on the 3d of\r\nNovember, 1742. His term of four years was passed without any events\r\nof remarkable importance for New Spain save the capture, by Anson, of\r\none of the East Indian galeons with a freight of one million three\r\nhundred and thirteen thousand dollars in coined silver, and four\r\nthousand four hundred and seventy marks of the same precious metal,\r\nbesides a quantity of the most valuable products of Mexico. This\r\nperiod of the viceroyalty must necessarily be uninteresting and\r\neventless. The wars of the old world were confined to the continent\r\nand to the sea. Mexico, locked up amid her mountains, was not easily\r\nassailed by enemies who could spare no large armies from the contests\r\nat home for enterprises in so distant a country. Besides, it was\r\neasier to grasp the harvest on the ocean that had been gathered on the\r\nland. England contented herself, therefore, with harassing and\r\npilfering the commerce of Castile, while Mexico devoted all her\r\nenergies to the development of her internal resources of mineral and\r\nagricultural wealth. Emigrants poured into the country. The waste\r\nlands were filling up. North, south, east and west, the country was\r\noccupied by industrious settlers and zealous curates, who were engaged\r\nin the cultivation of the soil and the spiritual subjection of the\r\nIndians. The spirit as well as the dangers of the conquest were past,\r\nand Mexico, assumed, in the history of the age, the position of a\r\nquiet, growing nation, equally distant from the romantic or\r\nadventurous era of early settlement when danger and difficulty\r\nsurrounded the Spaniards, and from the lethean stagnation into which\r\nshe fell in future years under Spanish misrule.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN FRANCISCO GUEMES Y HORCASITAS, COUNT DE REVILLA-GIGEDO--THE\r\nFIRST. XLI. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1746-1755.\r\n\r\nThe Conde de Revilla-Gigedo, the first of that name who was viceroy of\r\nMexico, reached the capital on the 9th of July, 1746, and on the 12th\r\nof the same month, his master, Philip V. died, leaving Ferdinand VI.\r\nas his successor. Under the reign of this enlightened nobleman the\r\ncolony prospered rapidly, and his services in increasing the royal\r\nrevenues were so signally successful that he was retained in power for\r\nnine years. Mexico had become a large and beautiful city. The mining\r\ndistricts were extraordinarily prolific, and no year of his government\r\nyielded less than eleven millions of dollars;--the whole sum that\r\npassed through the national mint during his term being one hundred and\r\nfourteen millions, two hundred and thirty-one thousand dollars of the\r\nprecious metals! The population of the capital amounted to fifty\r\nthousand families composed of Spaniards, Europeans and creoles,--forty\r\nthousand mestizos, mulattoes, negroes,--and eight thousand Indians,\r\nwho inhabited the suburbs. This population annually consumed at least\r\ntwo millions arobas of flour, about a hundred and sixty thousand\r\nfanegas of corn, three hundred thousand sheep, fifteen thousand five\r\nhundred beeves, and about twenty-five thousand swine. In this account,\r\nthe consumption of many religious establishments is not included, as\r\nthey were privately supplied from their estates, nor can we count the\r\nnumerous and valuable presents which were sent by residents of the\r\ncountry to their friends in the capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been already said that this viceroy augmented largely the\r\nincome of Spain. The taxes of the capital, accounted for by the\r\nConsulado, were collected yearly, and amounted to three hundred and\r\nthirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three dollars, whilst\r\nthose of the whole viceroyalty reached seven hundred and eighteen\r\nthousand, three hundred and seventy-five. The income from _pulque_\r\nalone,--the favorite drink of the masses,--was one hundred and\r\nseventy-two thousand dollars, while other imposts swelled the gross\r\nincome in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe collection of tributes was not effected invariably in the same\r\nmanner throughout the territory of New Spain. In Mexico the\r\n_Administrador-General_ imposed this task on the justices whose duty it\r\nwas to watch over the Indians. The aborigines in the capital were\r\ndivided into two sections, one comprising the Tenochas of San Juan, and\r\nthe other the Tlaltelolcos of Santiago, both of which had their\r\ngovernors and other police officers, according to Spanish custom. The\r\nfirst of these bands, dwelling on the north and east of the capital,\r\nwas, in the olden time, the most powerful and noble, and at that period\r\nnumbered five thousand nine hundred families. The other division,\r\nexisting on the west and south, was reduced to two thousand five hundred\r\nfamilies. In the several provinces of the viceroyalty the Indian\r\ntributes were collected through the intervention of one hundred and\r\nforty-nine chief _alcaldes_ who governed them, and who, before they took\r\npossession of their offices, were required to give security for the\r\ntribute taxed within their jurisdiction. The frontier provinces of this\r\nvast territory, inhabited only by garrisons, and a few scattered\r\ncolonists, were exempt from this odious charge. In all the various\r\nsections of the nation, however, the Indians were accurately enumerated.\r\nTwo natives were taxed together, in order to facilitate the collection\r\nby making both responsible, and, every four months, from this united\r\npair, six _reales_ were collected, making in all eighteen in the course\r\nof the year. This gross tax of two dollars and twenty-five cents was\r\ndivided as follows: eight _reales_ were taxed as tribute;--four for the\r\nroyal service;--four and a half as commutation for a half _fanega_ of\r\ncorn which was due to the royal granary;--half a _real_ for the royal\r\nhospital, in which the Indians were lodged when ill; another half _real_\r\nfor the costs of their law suits; and, finally, the remaining half\r\n_real_ for the construction of cathedrals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1748, the Count Revilla-Gigedo, in conformity to the orders of the\r\nking, and after consultation in general meeting with the officers of\r\nvarious tribunals, determined to lay the foundation of a grand colony\r\nin the north, under the guidance of Colonel José Escandon, who was\r\nforthwith appointed governor. This decree, together with an account of\r\nthe privileges and lands which would be granted to colonists, was\r\nextensively published, and, in a few years, a multitude of families\r\nand single emigrants founded eleven villages of Spaniards and\r\nmulattoes between Alta-Mira and Camargo. The Indians who were gathered\r\nin this neighborhood composed four missions; and, although it was\r\nfound impossible to clear the harbor of Santander, or to render it\r\ncapable of receiving vessels of deep draft, the government was\r\nnevertheless enabled to found several flourishing villages which were\r\nvigilant in the protection of the coast against pirates.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 the crops were lost in many of the provinces where the early\r\nfrost blighted the fields of corn and fruit. The crowded capital and\r\nits neighborhood, fortunately, did not experience the want of food,\r\nwhich in other regions of the _tierra adentro_ amounted to absolute\r\nfamine. The people believed that the frown of Heaven was upon the\r\nland,--for, to this calamity, repeated earthquakes were added, and the\r\nwhole region, from the volcano of Colima to far beyond Gaudalajara,\r\nwas violently shaken and rent, causing the death of many persons and\r\nthe ruin of large and valuable villages.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, Mexico was still free from scarcity, and even able, not only to\r\nsupport its own population, but to feed the numerous strangers who fled\r\nto it from the unfruitful districts. Yet, in the cities and villages of\r\nthe north and west, where the crops had been again lost, want and famine\r\nprevailed as in the previous year. From Guanajuato, a city rich in\r\nmines, to Zacatecas, the scarcity of food was excessive, and the\r\nenormous sum of twenty-five dollars was demanded and paid for a _fanega_\r\nof corn. Neither man nor beast had wherewith to support life, and, for a\r\nwhile, the labors in the mines of this rich region were suspended. The\r\nunfortunate people left their towns in crowds to subsist on roots and\r\nberries which they found in the forests. Many of them removed to other\r\nparts of the country, and, as it was at this period that the rich veins\r\nof silver at Bolaños were discovered, some of the poor emigrants found\r\nwork and food in a district whose sudden mineral importance induced the\r\nmerchants to supply it liberally with provisions. The end of the year,\r\nhowever, was fortunately crowned with abundant crops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1755,--after founding the Presidio of Horcasitas, in Sonora,\r\ndesigned to restrain the incursions of the Apaches into that\r\nprovince,--the Count Revilla-Gigedo, was recalled, at his own request,\r\nfrom the Mexican viceroyalty in order that he might devote himself to\r\nthe management of his private property, which had increased\r\nenormously, during his government. In the history of Mexican viceroys,\r\nthis nobleman is celebrated as a speculative and industrious trader.\r\nThere was no kind of commercial enterprise or profitable traffic in\r\nwhich he did not personally engage. His palace degenerated into an\r\nexchange, frequented by all kinds of adventurers, while gaming tables\r\nwere openly spread out to catch the doubloons of the viceroyal\r\ncourtiers. The speculations and profits of Revilla-Gigedo enabled him\r\nto found _Mayorazgos_ for his sons in Spain, and he was regarded,\r\nthroughout Europe, as the richest vassal of Ferdinand the VI. His son,\r\nwho subsequently became a Mexican viceroy, and was the second bearing\r\nthe family title, labored to blot out the stain which the trading\r\npropensities of his father had cast upon his name. He was a model of\r\npropriety in every respect; but, whilst he made no open display of\r\nanxiety to enrich himself corruptly through official influence or\r\nposition, he, nevertheless, exhibited the avaricious traits of his\r\nfather in requiring from his butler, each night an exact account of\r\nevery cent that was spent during the day, and every dish that was\r\nprepared in his kitchen.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the notorious and corrupting habits of the first\r\ncount, that personage contrived to exercise an extraordinary influence\r\nor control over the masses in Mexico. The people feared and respected\r\nhim; and, upon a certain occasion, when they were roused in the\r\ncapital and gathered in menacing mobs, this resolute viceroy, whose\r\nwild and savage aspect aided the authority of his determined address,\r\nrode into the midst of the turbulent assemblage without a soldier in\r\nattendance, and immediately dispersed the revolutionists by the mere\r\nauthority of his presence and command.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON AGUSTIN DE AHUMADA Y VILLALON, MARQUES DE LAS AMARILLAS, XLII.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1755-1760.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Marques de las Amarillas commenced on the 10th\r\nof November, 1755; and he immediately devoted himself to the task of\r\nreforming many of the abuses which had doubtless crept into the\r\nadministration of public affairs during the reign of his trafficing\r\npredecessor. Valuable mineral deposits were discovered in New Leon,\r\nwhose veins were found so rich and tempting that crowds of miners from\r\nZacatecas and Guanajuato flocked to the prolific region. Great works\r\nwere commenced to facilitate the working of the drifts, but the wealth\r\nwhich had so suddenly appeared on the scene as if by magic, vanished\r\namid the interminable quarrels and law suits of the parties. Many of\r\nthe foremost adventurers who imagined themselves masters of\r\nincalculable riches were finally forced to quit their discoveries, on\r\nfoot, without a dollar to supply themselves with food.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 a general mourning was proclaimed in Mexico for the queen of\r\nSpain, Maria Barbara of Portugal, who was speedily followed to the\r\ntomb by her husband Ferdinand VI. His brother Charles III. ascended\r\nthe throne, and whilst the mingled ceremonies of sorrow and festivity\r\nfor the dead and living were being performed in Mexico, the worthy\r\nviceroy was suddenly struck with apoplexy which his physicians thought\r\nmight be alleviated by his residence in the healthful and lower\r\nregions of Cuernavaca. But neither the change of level nor temperature\r\nimproved the condition of the viceroy, who died of this malady on the\r\n5th of January, 1760, in the beautiful city to which he had retreated.\r\nHe was a remarkable contrast to his predecessor in many respects, and\r\nalthough he had been viceroy for five years, it is stated, as a\r\nsingular fact in the annals of Mexico, that he left his widow poor and\r\naltogether unprovided for. But his virtuous conduct as an efficient\r\nminister of the crown had won the confidence and respect of the\r\nMexicans who were anxious to succor those whom he left dependant upon\r\nthe favor of the crown. The liberality of the archbishop Rubio y\r\nSalinas, however supplied all the wants of the gentle Marquesa, who\r\nwas thus enabled to maintain a suitable state until her return to the\r\ncourt of Spain, where the merits of her husband, as a Spanish soldier\r\nin the Italian wars, doubtless procured her a proper pension for life.\r\n\r\nAs the death of the Marques de las Amarillas was sudden and\r\nunexpected, the king of Spain had not supplied the government with the\r\nusual _pliego de mortaja_, or mortuary despatch, which was generally\r\nsent from Madrid whenever the health of a viceroy was feeble, so as to\r\nsupply his place by an immediate successor in the event of death. The\r\nAUDIENCIA, of course, became the depository of executive power during\r\nthe interregnum, and its dean Don Francisco Echavarri, directed public\r\naffairs, under its sanction, until the arrival of the viceroy, _ad\r\ninterim_, from Havana.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON FRANCISCO DE CAGIGAL, XLIII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1760--APRIL TO\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\nThe government of this personage was so brief, and his tenure so\r\ncompletely nominal, that he employed himself merely in the adornment\r\nof the capital and the general police of the colony. He was engaged in\r\nsome improvements in the great square of Mexico, when his successor\r\narrived; but he left the capital with the hearty regrets of the\r\ntownsmen, for his intelligence and affability had won their confidence\r\nand induced them to expect the best results from his prolonged reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1760-1771.\r\n\r\n    MARQUES DE CRUILLAS VICEROY.--CHARLES III.

VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1760-1766.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, soon after the entrance of the Marques de Cruillas into\r\nMexico, the ceremony of proclaiming the accession of Charles III. to\r\nthe throne, was performed with great pomp, by the viceroy, the nobles,\r\nand the municipality. But the period of rejoicing was short, for news\r\nsoon reached Mexico, that war was again declared between Spain and\r\nEngland; a fact which was previously concealed, in consequence of the\r\ninterception of despatches that had been sent to Havana. Don Juan de\r\nPrado was the governor of that important point, and he, as well as the\r\nviceroy of Mexico, had consequently been unable to make suitable\r\npreparations for the attacks of the British on the West Indian and\r\nAmerican possessions of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an English squadron, which had recruited its forces\r\nand supplied itself with provisions in Jamaica, disembarked its troops\r\nwithout resistance, on the 6th of June, two leagues east of the Moro\r\nCastle. The Havanese fought bravely with various success against the\r\ninvaders until the 30th of July, when the Spaniards, satisfied that\r\nall further defence was vain and rash, surrendered the Moro Castle to\r\nthe foe. On the 13th of August the town also capitulated; private\r\nproperty and the rights of religion being preserved intact. By this\r\nconquest the English obtained nine ships of the line, four frigates,\r\nand all the smaller vessels belonging to the sovereign and his\r\nsubjects, which were in the port; while four millions, six hundred\r\nthousand dollars, belonging to the king and found in the city, swelled\r\nthe booty of the fortunate invaders.\r\n\r\nWhilst this was passing in Havana it was falsely reported in Mexico that\r\nthe British, being unsuccessful in their attacks on Cuba, had raised the\r\nsiege, and were about to leave the islands for the Spanish main. The\r\nimportant port of Vera Cruz and its defences were of course not to be\r\nneglected under such circumstances. This incorrect rumor was, however,\r\nsoon rectified by the authentic news of the capture of the Moro Castle\r\nand of the city of Havana. The Marques de Cruillas immediately ordered\r\nall the militia to be raised in the provinces, even six hundred miles\r\nfrom the eastern coast, and to march forthwith to Vera Cruz. That city\r\nand its castle were at once placed in the best possible condition of\r\ndefence; but the unacclimated troops from the high and healthy regions\r\nof the interior who had been brought suddenly to the sickly sea shore of\r\nthe _tierra caliente_, suffered so much from malaria, that the viceroy\r\nwas obliged to withdraw them to Jalapa and Peroté.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mexico was thus in a state of alarm in 1763, and whilst the\r\ngovernment was troubled in consequence of the arrest of a clergyman\r\nwho had been seized as a British spy, the joyful news arrived that\r\npeace had again been negotiated between France and England.\r\n\r\nPestilence, as well as war, appears to have menaced Mexico at this\r\nepoch. The small pox broke out in the capital and carried off ten\r\nthousand persons. Besides this, another malady, which is described by\r\nthe writers of the period as similar to that which had ravaged the\r\ncountry a hundred and seven years before, and which terminated by an\r\nunceasing flow of blood from the nostrils, filled the hospitals of the\r\ncapital with its victims. From Mexico this frightful and contagious\r\nmalady passed to the interior, where immense numbers, unable to obtain\r\nmedical advice, medicine, or attendance, were carried to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe general administration of the viceroyalty by the Marques de Cruillas\r\nwas unsatisfactory both to the crown and the people of New Spain. The\r\nbest historians of the period are not definite in their charges of\r\nmisconduct against this nobleman, but his demeanor as an executive\r\nofficer required the appointment of a _visitador_, in order to examine\r\nand remedy his abuse of power. The person charged with this important\r\ntask,--Don José Galvez,--was endowed with unlimited authority entirely\r\nindependent of the viceroy, and he executed his office with severity. He\r\narrested high officers of the government, and deprived them of their\r\nemployments. His extraordinary talents and remarkable industry enabled\r\nhim to comprehend at once, and search into, all the tribunals and\r\ngovernmental posts of this vast kingdom. In Vera Cruz he removed the\r\nroyal accountants from their offices. In Puebla, and in Mexico, he\r\nturned out the superintendents of customs, and throughout the country,\r\nall who were employed in public civil stations, feared, from day to day,\r\nthat they would either be suspended or deposed. Whilst Galvez attended,\r\nthus, to the faithful discharge of duty by the officers of the crown, he\r\nlabored, also, to increase the royal revenue. Until that period the\r\ncultivation of tobacco had been free, but Galvez determined to control\r\nit, as in Spain, and made its preparation and sale a monopoly for the\r\ngovernment. Gladly as his other alterations and reforms were received by\r\nthe people, this interference with one of their cherished luxuries was\r\nwell nigh the cause of serious difficulties. In the city of Cordova, and\r\nin many neighboring places, some of the wealthiest and most influential\r\ncolonists depended for their fortunes and income upon the unrestrained\r\nproduction and manufacture of this article. Thousands of the poorer\r\nclasses were engaged in its preparation for market, while in all the\r\ncities, towns, and villages, there were multitudes who lived by selling\r\nit to the people. Every man, and perhaps every woman, in Mexico, used\r\ntobacco, and consequently this project of the _visitador_ gave\r\nreasonable cause for dissatisfaction to the whole of New Spain.\r\nNevertheless, the firmness of Galvez, the good temper of the Mexicans,\r\nand their habitual submission to authority, overcame all difficulties.\r\nThe inhabitants of Cordova were not deprived of all control over the\r\ncultivation of tobacco, and were simply obliged to sell it to the\r\nofficers of the king at a definite price, whilst these personages were\r\nordered to continue supplying the families of the poor, with materials\r\nfor the manufacture of cigars; and by this device the public treasury\r\nwas enabled to derive an important revenue from an article of universal\r\nconsumption. Thus the _visitador_ appears to have employed his authority\r\nin the reform of the colony and the augmentation of the royal revenue,\r\nwithout much attention to the actual viceroy, who was displaced in 1766.\r\nThe _fiscal_ or attorney general of the Audiencia of Manilla, Don José\r\nAréché, was ordered officially to examine into the executive conduct of\r\nthe Marques de Cruillas who had retired from the city of Mexico to\r\nCholula, and although it had been universally the custom to permit other\r\nviceroys to answer the charges made against them by attorney, this favor\r\nwas denied to the Marques, who was subjected to much inconvenience and\r\nsuffering during the long trial that ensued.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS FRANCISCO DE CROIX, MARQUES DE CROIX, XLV. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1766-1771.\r\n\r\nThe Marques de Croix was a native of the city of Lille in Flanders,\r\nand, born of an illustrious family, had obtained his military renown\r\nby a service of fifty years in the command of Ceuta, Santa-Maria, and\r\nthe Captaincy General of Galicia. He entered Mexico as viceroy on the\r\n25th of August, 1766.\r\n\r\nFor many years past, in the old world and in the new, there had been a\r\nsilent but increasing fear of the Jesuits. It was known that in\r\nAmerica their missionary zeal among the Indians in the remotest\r\nprovinces was unequalled. The winning manners of the cultivated\r\ngentlemen who composed this powerful order in the Catholic church,\r\ngave them a proper and natural influence with the children of the\r\nforest, whom they had withdrawn from idolatry and partially civilized.\r\nBut the worthy Jesuits, did not confine their zealous labors to the\r\nwilderness. Members of the order, all of whom were responsible and\r\nimplicitly obedient to their great central power, were spread\r\nthroughout the world, and were found in courts and camps as well as in\r\nthe lonely mission house of the frontier or in the wigwam of the\r\nIndian. They had become rich as well as powerful, for, whilst they\r\ntaught christianity, they did not despise the wealth of the world.\r\nWhatever may have been their personal humility, their love for the\r\nprogressive power and dignity of the order, was never permitted for a\r\nmoment to sleep. A body, stimulated by such a combined political and\r\necclesiastical passion, all of whose movements, might be controlled by\r\na single, central, despotic will, may now be kept in subjection in the\r\nold world, where the civil and military police is ever alert in\r\nsupport of the national authorities. But, at that epoch of transition\r\nin America whose vast regions were filled with credulous and ignorant\r\naborigines, and thinly sprinkled with intelligent, educated and loyal\r\nEuropeans, it was deemed dangerous to leave the superstitious Indians\r\nto become the prey, rather than the flock,--the instruments, rather\r\nthan the acolytes of such insidious shepherds. These fears had seized\r\nthe mind of Charles III. who dreaded a divided dominion in America,\r\nwith the venerable fathers. We do not believe that there was just\r\ncause for the royal alarm. We do not suppose that the Jesuits whose\r\nmembers, it is true, were composed of the subjects of all the Catholic\r\npowers of Europe, ever meditated political supremacy in Spanish\r\nAmerica, or designed to interfere with the rights of Charles or his\r\nsuccessors. But the various orders of the Roman church,--the various\r\ncongregations, and convents of priests and friars,--are unfortunately,\r\nnot free from that jealous rivalry which distinguishes the career of\r\nlaymen in all the other walks of life.\r\n\r\nIt may be that some of the pious brethren, whose education, manners,\r\nposition, wealth or power, was not equal to the influence, social rank\r\nand control, of the Jesuits, had, perhaps, been anxious to drive this\r\nrespectable order from America. It may be, that the king and his\r\ncouncil were willing to embrace any pretext to rid his colonial\r\npossessions of the Jesuits. But certain it is, that on the 25th of\r\nJune, before the dawn of day, at the same hour, throughout the whole\r\nof New Spain the decree for their expulsion was promulgated by order\r\nof Charles. The king was so anxious upon this subject, that he wrote,\r\nwith his own hand, to the viceroy of Mexico, soliciting his best\r\nservices in the fulfilment of the royal will. When the question was\r\ndiscussed in the privy council of the sovereign, a chart of both\r\nAmericas was spread upon the table,--the distances between the\r\ncolleges of the Jesuits accurately calculated,--and the time required\r\nfor the passage of couriers, carefully estimated, so that the blow\r\nmight fall simultaneously upon the order. The invasion of Havana by\r\nthe English and its successful capture, induced the king to supply his\r\nAmerican possessions with better troops, and more skilful commanders\r\nthan had been, hitherto, sent to the colonies. Thus there were\r\nvarious, veteran Spanish regiments in Mexico capable of restraining\r\nany outbreaks of the people in favor of the outraged fathers who had\r\nwon their respect and loyal obedience.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour, the order of Charles, was enforced. The Jesuits\r\nwere shut up in their colleges, and all avenues to these retreats of\r\nlearning and piety were filled with troops. The fathers were\r\ndespatched from Mexico for Vera Cruz on the 28th of June, surrounded\r\nby soldiers. They halted awhile in the town of Guadalupe, where the\r\n_Visitador_ Galvez, who governed the expedition, permitted them to\r\nenter, once more, into the national sanctuary, where amid the weeping\r\ncrowds of Mexicans, they poured forth their last, and fervent vows,\r\nfor the happiness of a people, who idolized them. Their entrance into\r\nJalapa was a triumph. Windows, balconies, streets, and house tops were\r\nfilled with people, whose demeanor manifested what was passing in\r\ntheir hearts, but who were restrained by massive ranks of surrounding\r\nsoldiery from all demonstration in behalf of the banished priests. In\r\nVera Cruz some silent but respectful tokens of veneration were\r\nbestowed upon the fathers, several of whom died in that pestilential\r\ncity before the vessels were ready to transport them beyond the sea.\r\nNor did their sufferings cease with their departure from New Spain.\r\nTheir voyage was long, tempestuous and disastrous, and after their\r\narrival in Spain, under strict guardianship, they were again embarked\r\nfor Italy, where they were finally settled with a slender support in\r\nRome, Bologna, Ferrara and other cities, in which they honored the\r\ncountry whence they had been driven by literary labors and charitable\r\nworks. The names of Abade, Alegre, Clavigero, Landibares, Maneyro,\r\nCavo, Lacunza and Marques, sufficiently attest the historical merit of\r\nthese Mexican Jesuits, who were victims of the suspicious Charles. For\r\na long time the Mexican mind was sorely vexed by the oppressive act\r\nagainst this favorite order. But the Visitador Galvez imposed absolute\r\nsilence upon the people,--telling them in insulting language that it\r\nwas their \"sole duty to obey,\" and that they must \"speak neither for\r\nnor against the royal order, which had been passed for motives\r\nreserved alone for the sovereign's conscience!\"\r\n\r\nThus, all expression of public sentiment, as well as of amiable\r\nfeeling, at this daring act against the worthiest and most benevolent\r\nclergymen of Mexico was effectually stifled. It had been well for New\r\nSpain if Charles had banished the Friars, and spared the Jesuits. The\r\nchurch of Mexico, in our age, would then have resembled the church of\r\nthe United States, whose foundation and renown are owing chiefly to\r\nthe labors of enlightened Sulpicians and Jesuits, as well as to the\r\nexclusion of monks and of all the orders that dwell in the idle\r\nseclusion of cloisters instead of passing useful lives amid secular\r\noccupations and temporal interests. If the act of Henry VIII. in\r\nEngland was unjust and cruel, it was matched both in boldness and\r\nwickedness by the despotic decree of the unrelenting Charles of Spain.\r\nNor can the latter sovereign claim the merit of having substituted\r\nvirtue for vice as the British king pretended he had done in the\r\nsuppression of the monasteries. Henry swept priest and friar from his\r\nkingdom with the same blow; but the trimming Charles banished the\r\nintellectual Jesuit whilst he saved and screened the lazy monk.\r\n\r\nThe pretext of Charles III. for his outrageous conduct was found in an\r\ninsurrection which occurred on the evening of Palm Sunday, 1766, and\r\ngave up the capital of Spain, for forty-eight hours, to a lawless mob.\r\nIt was doubtless the result of a preconcerted plan to get rid of an\r\nobnoxious minister; and, as soon as it was known that this personage\r\nhad been exiled, the rioters instantly surrendered their arms, made\r\nfriends with the soldiers, and departed to their homes. In fact, it\r\nwas a political intrigue, which the king and his minister charged on\r\nsome of the Spanish grandees and on the Jesuits. But as the former\r\nwere too powerful to be assailed by the king, his wrath was vented on\r\nthe Fathers of the Order of Jesus, whose lives, at this time, were not\r\nonly innocent but meritorious.\r\n\r\n\"Some years preceding, on a charge as destitute of foundation, they\r\nhad been expelled from Portugal. In 1764, their inveterate foe, the\r\nDuke de Choiseul, minister of Louis XV., had driven them from France;\r\nand, in Spain, their possessions were regarded with an avaricious eye\r\nby some of the needy courtiers. To effect their downfall, the French\r\nminister eagerly joined with the advocates of plunder; and intrigues\r\nwere adopted which must cover their authors with everlasting infamy.\r\nNot only was the public alarm carefully excited by a report of\r\npretended plots, and the public indignation, by slanderous\r\nrepresentations of their persons and principles; but, in the name of\r\nthe chiefs of the order, letters were forged, which involved the most\r\nmonstrous doctrines and the most criminal designs. A pretended\r\ncircular from the general of the order, at Rome, to the provincial,\r\ncalling on him to join with the insurgents; the deposition of perjured\r\nwitnesses to prove that the recent commotion was chiefly the work of\r\nthe body, deeply alarmed Charles, and drew him into the views of the\r\nFrench cabinet.\"[46]\r\n\r\nSpain was thus made a tool of France in an act of gross injustice, not\r\nonly to the reverend sufferers, but to the people over whose spiritual\r\nand intellectual wants they had so beneficially watched.\r\n\r\nFrom this digression to the mingled politics of Mexico and Europe we\r\nshall now return to the appropriate scene of our brief annals. The\r\ncaptain of so important a port as Havana, and the inadequate\r\nprotection of the coast along the main, obliged the government to\r\nthink seriously about the increase and discipline of domestic troops,\r\nand especially, to improve the condition of the coast defence. These\r\nfears were, surely, not groundless. The possessions of Great Britain,\r\nnorth of Mexico, on the continent, were growing rapidly in size and\r\nimportance; and from the provinces which now form the United States,\r\nthe viceroy imagined England might easily despatch sufficient troops,\r\nwithout being obliged to transport reinforcements from Europe.\r\nAccordingly suitable preparations were made to receive the enemy\r\nshould he venture to descend suddenly on the Spanish main. The veteran\r\nregiments of Savoy and Flanders were sent to the colony in June, 1768,\r\nand the Marshal de Rubi was charged with the disposition of the army.\r\nFrom that period, it may be said, that Mexico assumed the military\r\naspect, which it has continuously worn to the present time.\r\n\r\nBesides the increase and improvement of the troops of the line, the\r\ngovernment's attention was directed towards the fortification of the\r\nports and interior passes. The Castle of San Juan de Ulua was repaired\r\nat a cost of a million and a half of dollars. The small island of\r\nAnton Lizardo was protected by military works at an expense of a\r\nmillion two hundred thousand dollars. A splendid battery was sent from\r\nSpain for the castle, and the inefficient guns of Acapulco were\r\ndespatched to the Fillipine islands to be recast and sent back to\r\nAmerica. In the interior of the country, in the midst of the plain of\r\nPeroté, the Castle of San Carlos was built in the most substantial and\r\nscientific manner; and although this fortress seems useless, placed as\r\nit is in the centre of a broad and easily traversed prairie, yet, at\r\nthe time of its construction, it was designed as an _entre depot_\r\nbetween the capital and the coast, in which the royal property might\r\nalways be safely kept until the moment of exportation, instead of\r\nbeing exposed to the danger of a sudden seizure by the enemy in the\r\nport of Vera Cruz. Many other points along the road from Vera Cruz are\r\nbetter calculated to defend the interior passes of the country from\r\ninvasion; but as the attacks of the enemy were not expected to be made\r\nbeyond the coast upon which they naturally supposed they would find\r\nthe treasure they desired to plunder, it was deemed best to establish\r\nand arm the fortress of San Carlos de Peroté.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the leading acts and occurrences in New Spain during\r\nthe viceroyalty of the Marques de Croix. His general administration of\r\naffairs is characterized by justice. He lived in harmony with the\r\nrigid Visitador Galvez, and although the gossips of the day declared\r\nhe was too fond of wine, yet, on his return to Spain he was named\r\nCaptain General of the army, and treated most kindly by the king.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Dr. Dunham's History of Spain and Portugal, vol. 5, p.\r\n175.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1771-1784.\r\n\r\n    BUCARELI Y URSUA VICEROY.--PROGRESS OF NEW SPAIN.--GOLD PLACERES\r\n    IN SONORA.--MINERAL WEALTH AT THAT PERIOD.--INTELLECTUAL CONDITION\r\n    OF THE COUNTRY.--LINE OF PRESIDIOS.--MAYORGA VICEROY.--POLICY OF\r\n    SPAIN TO ENGLAND AND HER COLONIES.--OPERATIONS ON THE SPANISH MAIN\r\n    ETC.--MATIAS GALVEZ VICEROY--HIS ACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON ANTONIO MARIA DE BUCARELI Y URSUA, LIEUTENANT GENERAL OF THE\r\nSPANISH ARMY, XLVI. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1771-1779.\r\n\r\nBucareli reached Vera Cruz from Havana on the 23d of August, 1771, and\r\ntook possession of the viceroyalty on the 2d of the following month.\r\nDuring his administration the military character of the colony was\r\nstill carefully fostered, whilst the domestic interests of the people\r\nwere studied, and every effort made to establish the public works and\r\nnational institutions upon a firm basis. The new mint and the Monte de\r\nPiadad are monuments of this epoch. Commerce flourished in those days\r\nin Mexico. The fleet under the command of Don Luis de Cordova departed\r\nfor Cadiz on the 30th of November, 1773, with twenty-six millions two\r\nhundred and fifty-five dollars, exclusive of a quantity of cacao,\r\ncochineal and twenty-two marks of fine gold, and the fleet of 1774 was\r\nfreighted with twenty-six millions four hundred and fifty-seven\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nNor was the accumulation of wealth derived at that time from the golden\r\n_placeres_ of Cieneguilla in Sonora less remarkable. From the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1773, to the 17th of November of the year following, there were\r\naccounted for, in the royal office at Alamos, four thousand, eight\r\nhundred and thirty-two marks of gold, the royal duties on which, of\r\ntithe and _senorage_, amounted to seventy-two thousand, three hundred\r\nand forty-eight dollars. The custom house of Mexico, according to the\r\naccounts of the _consulado_, produced, in 1772, six hundred and\r\neighty-seven thousand and forty-one dollars, the duty on pulque alone,\r\nbeing two hundred and forty-four thousand, five hundred and thirty.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, Bucareli endeavored to liberate trade from many of the odious\r\nrestrictions which had been cast around it by old commercial usages,\r\nand by the restrictive policy of Spain. The _consulado_ of Mexico\r\ncomplained to Bucareli of the suffering it endured by the monopoly\r\nwhich had hitherto been enjoyed by the merchants of Cadiz, and through\r\nthe viceroy solicited the court to be permitted to remit its funds to\r\nSpain, and to bring back the return freights in vessels on its own\r\naccount, Bucareli supported this demand with his influence, and may be\r\nsaid to have given the first impulse to free-trade. Meanwhile, the\r\nmineral resources of Mexico were not neglected. During the seven years\r\nof Bucareli's reign, the yield of the mines had every year been\r\ngreater than at any period since the conquest. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven millions, three hundred and ninety-six thousand dollars,\r\nin gold and silver, were coined during his viceroyalty. Laborde, in\r\nZacatecas, and Terreros in Pachuca, had undertaken extensive works at\r\nthe great and rich mine of Quebradilla and in the splendid vein of\r\nVizcayna. Other mines were most successfully wrought by their\r\nproprietors. From 1770 to the end of 1778, Don Antonio Obregon\r\npresented to the royal officers, in order to be taxed, four thousand\r\nsix hundred and ninety-nine bars of silver, the royal income from\r\nwhich amounted to six hundred and forty-eight thousand nine hundred\r\nand seventy-two dollars. The same individual had, moreover, presented\r\nto the same personage, fifty-three thousand and eighty-eight\r\n_castellanos_ of gold, which paid thirteen thousand eight hundred and\r\nseventy-one dollars in duties. In order to work his metals, Obregon\r\nhad been furnished, to that date, one thousand eight hundred and\r\nthirty-nine quintals of quicksilver, for which he paid a hundred and\r\nfifty-nine thousand two hundred and forty-one dollars.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1778, the mineral deposits of Hostotipaquillo, in the\r\nprovince of Guadalajara, now Jalisco, were discovered, and promised\r\nthe most extraordinary returns of wealth. In the following year, the\r\nvaluable mines of Catorce, were accidentally found by a soldier whilst\r\nsearching for a lost horse. All these discoveries and beneficial\r\nlabors induced Bucareli to recommend the mineral interests of New\r\nSpain particularly to the sovereign, and various persons were charged\r\nto explore the country, for the discovery of quicksilver mines, which\r\nit was alleged existed in Mexico. The extraction of quicksilver from\r\nAmerican mines had hitherto been prohibited by Spain, but the fear of\r\nwars, which might prevent its importation from abroad, and\r\nconsequently, destroy the increasing mineral industry of the nation,\r\ninduced the court to send Don Raphael Heling and Don Antonio Posada,\r\nwith several subordinates, who formerly wrought in the mines of\r\nAlmaden, to examine the deposits at Talchapa and others in the\r\nneighborhood of Ajuchitlan, in October, 1778, under the direction of\r\n_padre_ Alzate. But this reconnoisance proved unavailing at that time,\r\ninasmuch as the explorers found no veins or deposits which repaid the\r\ncost and labor of working.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch the Spanish government began to manifest a desire to\r\npropagate information in its American possessions. There is a gleam of\r\nintellectual dawn seen in a royal order of Charles, in 1776,\r\ncommanding educated ecclesiastics to devote themselves to the study of\r\nMexican antiquities, mineralogy, metallurgy, geology, and fossils.\r\nThis decree was directed to the clergy because his majesty, perhaps\r\njustly supposed, that they were the only persons who possessed any\r\nknowledge of natural sciences, whilst the rest of his American\r\nsubjects were in the most profound ignorance. Archbishop Lorenzano\r\npublished in Mexico in 1770 his annotated edition of the letters of\r\nCortéz, which is a well printed work, adorned with coarse engravings,\r\na few maps, and the curious fac-simile pictures of the tributes paid\r\nto the Emperor Montezuma. But the jealous monks of the inquisition\r\nkept a vigilant watch over the issues of the press, and we find that,\r\nin those days, the commercial house of Prado and Freyre was forced to\r\ncrave a license from the court empowering them to ship two boxes of\r\ntypes to be used in the printing of the calendar!\r\n\r\nThe administration of Bucareli was not disturbed by insurrections\r\namong the creoles and Spaniards, for he was a just ruler and the\r\npeople respected his orders, even when they were apparently injurious\r\nto their interests. The viceroy adorned their capital built aqueducts,\r\nimproved roads, and facilitated intercourse between the various parts\r\nof the country; but the Indians of the north in the province of\r\nChihuahua harassed the colonists dwelling near the outposts during\r\nnearly all the period of his government. These warlike, nomadic tribes\r\nhave been the scourge of the frontier provinces since the foundation\r\nof the first outpost settlement. They are wild hunters, and appear to\r\nhave no feeling in common with those southern bands who were subdued\r\nby the mingled influences of the sword and of the cross into tame\r\nagriculturists. Bucareli attacked and conquered parties of these\r\nwandering warriors, but every year fresh numbers descended upon the\r\nscattered pioneers along the frontier, so that the labor of\r\nrecolonization and fighting was annually repeated. Towards the close\r\nof his administration, De Croix, who succeeded Hugo Oconor in the\r\ncommand along the northern line, established a chain of well appointed\r\n_presidios_, which in some degree restrained the inroads of these\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nBucareli died, after a short illness, on the 9th of April, 1779, and\r\nhis remains were deposited in the church of Guadalupe in front of the\r\nsacred and protecting image of the virgin who watches according to the\r\nlegend, over the destinies of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON MARTIN DE MAYORGA, XLVII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1779-1783.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the death of Bucareli the Audiencia assumed the\r\ngovernment of New Spain until the appointment of his successor, and in\r\nthe meanwhile, on the 18th of May, 1779, Charles III. solemnly declared\r\nwar against England. The misunderstanding which gave rise to the\r\nrevolutionary outbreak in the English colonies of North America was\r\nbeginning to attract the notice of Europe. France saw in the quarrel\r\nbetween the Americans and the British an opportunity to humiliate her\r\ndangerous foe; and although Spain had no interest in such a contest, the\r\nminister of Charles, Florida Blanca, persuaded his master to unite with\r\nFrance in behalf of the revolted colonies. Spain, in this instance, as\r\nin the expulsion of the Jesuits, was, doubtless, submissive to the will\r\nof the French court, and willingly embraced an occasion to humble the\r\npride or destroy the power of a haughty nation whose fleets and\r\npiratical cruisers had so long preyed upon the wealthy commerce of her\r\nAmerican possessions. The Spanish minister did not probably dream of the\r\ndangerous neighbor whose creation he was aiding, north of the Gulf of\r\nMexico. It is not likely that he imagined republicanism would be soon\r\nand firmly established in the British united colonies of America, and\r\nthat the infectious love of freedom would spread beyond the wastes of\r\nTexas and the deserts of California to the plateaus and plains of Mexico\r\nand Peru. The policy was at once blind and revengeful. If it was\r\nproduced by the intrigue of France, the old hereditary foe and rival of\r\nEngland, it was still less pardonable, for a fault or a crime when\r\nperpetrated originally and boldly by a nation sometimes rises almost\r\ninto glory, if successful; but a second-hand iniquity, conceived in\r\njealousy and vindictiveness, is as mean as it is short sighted. England\r\nhad no friends at that epoch. Her previous conduct had been so selfishly\r\ngrasping, that all Europe rejoiced when her colonial power was broken by\r\nthe American revolution. Portugal, Holland, Russia, Morocco and Austria,\r\nall, secretly favored the course of Spain and France, and the most\r\ndiscreet politicians of Europe believed that the condition of Great\r\nBritain was hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of this impolitic war was finally made in Mexico on\r\nthe 12th of August, 1779, before the arrival of Mayorga, the new\r\nviceroy, who did not reach the capital till the 23d of the same month.\r\nThe Mexicans were not as well acquainted with the politics of the\r\nworld as the Spanish cabinet, and did not appreciate all the delicate\r\nand diplomatic motives which actuated Charles III. They regarded a war\r\nwith England as a direct invitation to the British to ravage their\r\ncoasts and harass their trade; and, accordingly as soon as the direful\r\nnews was announced, prayers were solemnly uttered in all the churches\r\nfor the successful issue of the contest. Nor did war alone strike the\r\nMexicans with panic; for in this same period the small pox broke out\r\nin the capital; and in the ensuing months in the space of sixty-seven\r\ndays, no less than eight thousand eight hundred and twenty-one persons\r\nwere hurried by it to the grave. It was a sad season of pestilence and\r\nanxiety. The streets were filled with dead bodies, while the temples\r\nwere crowded with the diseased and the healthy who rushed\r\npromiscuously to the holy images, in order to implore divine aid and\r\ncompassion. This indiscriminate mixture of all classes and\r\nconditions,--this stupid reunion of the sound and the sick, whose\r\nsuperstitions led them to the altar instead of the hospital, soon\r\nspread the contagion far and wide, until all New Spain suffered from\r\nits desolating ravages and scarcely a person was found unmarked by its\r\nfrightful ravages.\r\n\r\nAn expedition had been ordered during the viceroyalty of Bucareli to\r\nexplore portions of the Pacific adjacent to the Mexican coast, and in\r\nFebruary of 1799, it reached a point 55° 17 minutes north. It\r\ncontinued its voyage, until on the 1st of July, when it took\r\npossession of the land at 60° 13 minutes, in the name of Charles III.\r\nIt then proceeded onwards, in sight of the coast, and on the 1st of\r\nAugust, arrived at a group of islands, at 59° 8' upon one of which the\r\nexplorers landed and named the spot, \"Nuestra Señora de Regla.\"\r\n\r\nThe expected assaults of the English in the Atlantic were not long\r\nwithheld, for in this year, on the 20th of October, they seized Omoa\r\nin Guatemala, for the recovery of which the president, Don Matias\r\nGalvez, quitted the capital immediately and demanded succor from\r\nMexico. The Indians, it is related, aided the British in this attack,\r\nbut the assailants abandoned the captured port, after stripping it of\r\nits cannon and munitions of war, in consequence of the insalubrity of\r\nthe climate. The British had established a post at a place then called\r\nWallis, the centre of a region rich in dye-woods, and aptly situated\r\nso as to aid in the contraband trade which they carried on with\r\nYucatan, Guatemala and Chiapas; and, accordingly Don Roberto Rivas\r\nVetancourt attacked the settlement successfully, making prisoners of\r\nall the inhabitants, more than three hundred slaves, and capturing a\r\nnumber of small vessels. But just as hostilities ceased, two English\r\nfrigates and another armed vessel, arrived to succor the settlement,\r\nand forced the Spanish governor to abandon his enterprise and depart\r\nwith his flotilla. Nevertheless Vetancourt, burned more than forty\r\ndifferent foreign establishments, and succeeded in capturing an\r\nEnglish brigantine of forty-four guns. The commander believed that\r\nthis signal devastation of the enemy's settlement and property would\r\nresult in freeing the land from such dangerous neighbors.\r\n\r\nAbout this period the Spanish government detached General Solano and a\r\npart of his squadron, with orders for America, to aid in the military\r\nenterprises designed against Florida, in which Mexico was to take a\r\nsignificant part. This commander was to co-operate with Don Bernardo de\r\nGalvez, and both these personages, in the years 1779, 1780 and 1781,\r\nmaking common cause with the French against the English, carried the war\r\nactively up the Mississippi and into various portions of Florida. The\r\nremaining period of Mayorga's viceroyalty was chiefly occupied with\r\npreparations in the neighborhood of Vera Cruz against an assault from\r\nthe British, and in suppressing, by the aid of the alcalde Urizar, a\r\ntrifling revolt among the Indians of Izucar. An unfortunate disagreement\r\narose between Mayorga and the Spanish minister Galvez, and he was\r\nfinally, after many insults from the count, displaced, in order to make\r\nroom for Don Matias Galvez. The unfortunate viceroy departed for Spain\r\nbut never reached his native land. He died in sight of Cadiz, and his\r\nwife was indemnified for the ill treatment of her husband by the\r\ncontemptible gift of twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nMayorga was the victim apparently of an ill disposed minister, who\r\ncontrolled the pliant mind of Charles. The viceroy in reality had\r\ndischarged his duties as lieutenant of the king, with singular\r\nfidelity. All branches of art and industry in Mexico received his\r\nfostering care; but he had enemies who sought his disgrace at court,\r\nand they were finally successful in their shameful efforts.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nDON MATIAS DE GALVEZ, XLVIII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1783-1784.\r\n\r\nDon Matias Galvez, hastened rapidly from Guatemala to take possession\r\nof the viceroyalty, and soon exhibited his generous character and his\r\nardent desire to improve and embellish the beautiful capital. The\r\nacademy of fine arts was one of his especial favorites, and he\r\ninsisted that Charles should not only endow it with nine thousand\r\ndollars, but should render it an effective establishment, by the\r\nintroduction of the best models for the students. These evidences of\r\nhis munificence and taste, still exist in the fine but untenanted\r\nhalls of the neglected academy. Galvez directed his attention, also,\r\nto the police of Mexico and its prisons;--he required the streets to\r\nbe leveled and paved; prohibited the raising of recruits for Manilla,\r\nand solicited from the king authority to reconstruct the magnificent\r\npalace of Chapultepec on the well known and beautiful hill of that\r\nname which lies about two miles west of the capital, still girt with\r\nits ancient cypresses.\r\n\r\nIt was during the brief reign of this personage that the political\r\nGazette of Mexico was established, and the exclusive privilege of its\r\npublication granted to Manuel Valdez. On the 3d of November Don Matias\r\ndied, after a brief illness, unusually lamented by the people, from\r\namidst whose masses he had risen to supreme power in the most\r\nimportant colony of Spain. Mexico had regarded his appointment as a\r\nsingular good fortune, and it was fondly but vainly hoped that his\r\nreign might have been long, and that he would have been enabled to\r\ncarry out the beneficent projects he designed for the country.\r\n\r\nAs the death of this officer was sudden and unexpected, no _carta de\r\nmortaja_, or mortuary despatch, had been sent from Spain announcing\r\nhis successor, and, accordingly the Audiencia assumed the reins of\r\ngovernment until the arrival of the new viceroy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: See Bustamante's continuation of Cavo, vol. 3, pp. 45, 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAPULTEPEC.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1785-1794.\r\n\r\n    BERNARDO DE GALVEZ VICEROY.--CHAPULTEPEC.--GALVEZ DIES--HIS\r\n    DAUGHTER.--HARO VICEROY--CORRUPTION OF ALCALDES.--FLORES\r\n    VICEROY--HIS SYSTEM OF RULING THE NORTHERN FRONTIER--MINING\r\n    INTERESTS.--II.

VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.\r\n1785-1786.\r\n\r\nThe Count Galvez, son of the last viceroy, Don Matias, took charge of\r\nthe government on the 17th of June, 1785, but enjoyed as brief a reign\r\nas his respected father. Hardly had he attained power when a great\r\nscarcity of food was experienced among the people of New Spain in\r\nconsequence of an extraordinarily unfavorable season. The excellent\r\ndisposition of the new officer was shown in his incessant and liberal\r\nefforts to relieve the public distress in all parts of the country\r\nafflicted by misery. Meetings were held and committees appointed under\r\nhis auspices, composed of the most distinguished Spanish and native\r\nsubjects to aid in this beneficent labor; and over four hundred\r\nthousand dollars were given by the Archbishop of Mexico, and the\r\nbishops of Puebla and Michoacan, to encourage agriculture, as well as\r\nto relieve the most pressing wants of the people. In order to afford\r\nemployment to the indigent, at the same time that he permanently\r\nimproved and beautified the capital and the country generally, the\r\nviceroy either commenced or continued a number of important public\r\nworks, among which were the national roads and the magnificent palace\r\nof Chapultepec, the favorite retreat of his father. This splendid\r\narchitectural combination of fortress and palace, was a costly luxury\r\nto the Spanish government, for the documents of the period declare\r\nthat, up to the month of January, 1787, one hundred and twenty-three\r\nthousand and seventy-seven dollars had been expended in its\r\nconstruction. Nor was the ministry well pleased with so lavish an\r\noutlay upon this royal domain. Placed on a solitary hill, at a short\r\ndistance from the capital, and built evidently for the double purpose\r\nof defence and dwelling, it created a fear, in the minds of some\r\nsensitive persons, that its design might not be altogether so peaceful\r\nas was pretended. An ambitious viceroy, surrounded by troops whose\r\nattachment and firmness could be relied on, might easily convert the\r\npalace into a citadel; and it was noted that Galvez, had upon various\r\noccasions played the demagogue among the military men who surrounded\r\nhim in the capital. All these fears were, however, idle. If the count,\r\nin reality, entertained any ambitious projects, or desired to put\r\nhimself at the head of an American kingdom independent of Spain, these\r\nhopes were soon and sadly blighted by his early death. He expired on\r\nthe 30th of November, 1786, in the archiepiscopal palace of Tacubaya.\r\n\r\nHis funeral ceremonies were conducted by the archbishop, and his\r\nhonored remains interred in the church of San Fernando. At the period\r\nof the viceroy's decease his wife was pregnant; and it is stated, in\r\nthe chronicles of the day,--and we mention it as a singular\r\nillustration of Spanish habits,--that the daughter, of which she was\r\ndelivered in the following month of December, received the names of,\r\n_Maria de Guadalupe Bernarda Isabel Felipa de Jesus Juana Nepomucena\r\nFelicitas_, to which was joined at the period of the lady's\r\nconfirmation, the additional one of _Fernanda_! The Ayuntamiento of\r\nMexico, in order to show its appreciation of the viceroy's memory,\r\noffered to become _god-father_ of the infant, and the ceremony of its\r\nbaptism was performed with all the splendor of the Catholic church, in\r\nthe presence of the court and of a portion of the army. The defunct\r\nviceroy had become popular with the masses, and the people strove to\r\nmanifest their love for the dead by their affectionate courtesy to his\r\norphan, daughter and desolate widow.\r\n\r\nThe AUDIENCIA REAL assumed the government of Mexico, inasmuch as the\r\nSpanish ministry had provided no successor in the event of the count's\r\ndeath. Its power continued until the following February, during which\r\nperiod no event of note occurred in New Spain, save the destruction by\r\nfire of valuable mining property at Bolaños, and a violent hurricane\r\nat Acapulco, accompanied by earthquakes, which swept the sea over the\r\ncoast, and caused great losses to the farmers and herdsmen who dwelt\r\non the neighboring lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUÑEZ DE HARO, ARCHBISHOP OF MEXICO, L. VICEROY, AD INTERIM, OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1787.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of this eminent prelate to the viceroyalty _ad\r\ninterim_ by a royal order of 25th February, 1787, was perhaps one of\r\nthose strokes of policy by which the Spanish ministry strove to\r\nreconcile and connect the ecclesiastical and civil unity of the\r\nAmerican empire. The sway of the archbishop, complimentary as it was\r\nto himself and to the church, was exceedingly brief, for he entered\r\nupon the government on the 8th of May and was superceded by Flores on\r\nthe 17th of August of the same year. New Spain was undisturbed during\r\nhis government; and no event is worthy of historical record in these\r\nbrief annals of the country, save the effort that was made to prohibit\r\nthe _repartimiento_ or subdivision of the Indians among the\r\nagriculturists and miners by the _sub-delegados_, who had succeeded\r\nthe _alcaldes mayores_, in the performance of this odious task. The\r\nconduct of the latter personages had been extremely cruel to the\r\nnatives. They either used their power to oppress the Indians, or had\r\ntrafficked in the dispensation of justice by allowing the sufferers to\r\npurchase exemption from punishment; and it is related that in certain\r\n_alcaldias mayores_ in Oaxaca, the _alcaldes_ had enriched themselves\r\nto the extent of more than two hundred thousand dollars by these\r\nbrutal exactions. Inhumanity like this, was severely denounced to the\r\nking by the bishop Ortigoza,--who merited, according to\r\nRevilla-Gigedo, the title of the Saint Paul of his day,--and the\r\neloquent prelate complained in behalf of his beloved Indians as\r\nvehemently as Las Casas at an earlier period of this loathsome\r\noppression. But interest overcome the appeals of mercy in almost all\r\ninstances since the foundation of the American empire. The Spaniards\r\nrequired laborers. The ignorant and unarmed Indians of the south and\r\nof the table lands, were docile or unorganized, and, although the\r\nSpanish court and Council of the Indies seconded the viceroy's zeal in\r\nattempting to suppress the cruelty of the planters and miners, the\r\nunfortunate aborigines only experienced occasional brief intervals of\r\nrespite in the system of forced labor to which they were devoted by\r\ntheir legal task-masters.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON MANUEL FLORES, LI. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1787-1789.\r\n\r\nDon Manuel Flores assumed the government of New Spain on the 16th of\r\nMay, 1787, but his power over the finances of the nation was taken\r\nfrom him and given to Fernando Mangino, with the title of\r\n_Superintendente sub-delegado de Hacienda_. Flores was thus left in\r\npossession solely of the civil administration generally, and of the\r\nmilitary organization of the viceroyalty. Being satisfied that the\r\nordinary _militia_ system of New Spain was inadequate for national\r\nprotection during war, he immediately devoted himself to the forced\r\nlevy and equipment of three regiments of infantry, named \"Puebla,\"\r\n\"Mexico\" and \"New Spain.\" The command of these forces was given to the\r\nmost distinguished and noble young men of Mexico;--and as the minister\r\nGalvez died, and Mangino was, about this period, transferred to the\r\nCouncil of the Indies, the superintendence of the finances of Mexico,\r\nwas appropriately restored again to the viceroyal government.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Mexico, in 1788 and for many previous years had\r\nbeen constantly ravaged by the wild Indian tribes that ranged across the\r\nwhole frontier from the western limits of Sonora to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nImmense sums were squandered in the support of garrisons or the\r\nmaintenance of numerous officers, whose duty it was to hold these\r\nbarbarians in check. But their efforts had been vain. The fine\r\nagricultural districts of Chihuahua, New Leon, New Mexico and even in\r\nparts of Texas, had attracted large numbers of adventurous pioneers into\r\nthat remote region; yet no sooner did their fields begin to flourish and\r\ntheir flocks or herds to increase, than these savages descended upon the\r\nscattered settlers and carried off their produce and their families.\r\nWhenever the arms of New Spain obtained a signal victory over one of\r\nthese marauding bands, the Indians would talk of peace and even consent\r\nto bind themselves by treaties. But these compacts were immediately\r\nbroken, as soon as they found the country beginning to flourish again,\r\nor the military power in the least degree relaxed.\r\n\r\nFlores appears to have understood the condition of the northern\r\nfrontier and the temper of the Indians. He did not believe that\r\ntreaties, concessions or kindness would suffice to protect the Spanish\r\npioneers, and yet he was satisfied that it was necessary to sustain\r\nthe settlements, in that quarter, in order to prevent the southern\r\nprogress of European adventurers who were eager to seize the wild and\r\ndebatable lands lying on both sides of the Rio Grande. Accordingly he\r\nproposed to the Spanish court to carry on a war of most inexorable\r\ncharacter against the Apaches, Lipans and Mesclaros. He characterized,\r\nin his despatches, all the Indian tribes dwelling or wandering between\r\nthe Presidio of the Bay of Espiritu Santo, in the province of Texas,\r\nto beyond Santa Gertrudis del Altar, in Sonora,--the two opposite\r\npoints of the dangerous frontier line,--as Apaches or their hostile\r\ncolleagues; and he resolved to fight them, without quarter, truce, or\r\nmercy, until they surrendered unconditionally to the power of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of these provinces, and the experience of our\r\nown government, have shown the wisdom of this advice in regard to a\r\nband of savages whose habits are peculiarly warlike and whose robber\r\ntraits have made them equally dangerous to all classes of settlers in\r\nthe lonely districts of the Rio Grande or of the Gila and Colorado of\r\nthe west. His secretary, Bonilla,--who had fought bravely in the\r\nnorthern provinces, and was practically acquainted with warfare among\r\nthese barbarians,--seconded the mature opinion of the viceroy. The\r\nplan was successful for the time, and the frontier enjoyed a degree of\r\npeace, whilst the military power was sustained throughout the line of\r\nPresidios, which it has not known since the revolution in Mexico\r\nattracted the attention of all towards the central parts of the nation\r\nand left the north comparatively exposed. Flores enforced his system\r\nrigidly, during his viceroyalty. He equipped the expeditions\r\nliberally; promoted the officers who distinguished themselves;\r\nrewarded the bravest soldiers; and despatched a choice regiment of\r\ndragoons to Durango, whose officers, formed, in that city, the nucleus\r\nof its future civilization.\r\n\r\nNor was this viceroy stinted in his efforts to improve the capital and\r\nprotect the growing arts and sciences of the colony. He labored to\r\nestablish a botanical garden, under the auspices of Don Martin Sesé;\r\nbut the perfect realization of this beneficial and useful project was\r\nreserved for his successor the Count Revilla-Gigedo.\r\n\r\nThe mining interests, too, were prospering, and improvements on the\r\nancient Spanish system were sought to be introduced, through the\r\ninstrumentality of eleven German miners whose services had been\r\nengaged by the home government in Dresden, through its envoy Don Luis\r\nOrcis. These personages presented themselves in New Spain with the\r\npompous title of practical professors of mineralogy, but they were\r\naltogether unskilled in the actual working of mines, and unable to\r\nrender those of Mexico more productive. The only benefit derived from\r\nthis mineralogical mission was the establishment of a course of\r\nchemical lectures in the seminary of mines, under the direction of\r\nLewis Leinder, who set up the first laboratory in Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of December, 1788, the minister of the Indies apprised the\r\nviceroy of the death of Charles III., which had occurred in the middle\r\nof that month. Funeral ceremonies were celebrated, with great pomp, in\r\nMexico, in honor of the defunct monarch; and, on the 22d of February,\r\n1789, the resignation of the viceroyalty by Flores,--who desired\r\nheartily to retire from public life--was graciously accepted by the\r\nSpanish court, and his successor named, in the person of the second\r\nCount Revilla-Gigedo.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT DE REVILLA-GIGEDO--THE SECOND, LII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.\r\n1789-1794.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished nobleman, whose name figures so favorably in the\r\nannals of Mexico, reached Guadalupe on the 16th of October 1789, and\r\non the following day entered the capital with all the pompous\r\nceremonies usual in New Spain upon the advent of a new ruler. In the\r\nfollowing month--the new sovereign Charles IV. was proclaimed; and the\r\nviceroy, at once set about the regulation of the municipal police of\r\nhis capital which seems to have been somewhat relaxed since the days\r\nof his dreaded and avaricious father. Assassinations of the most\r\nscandalous and daring character, had recently warned the viceroy of\r\nthe insecurity of life and property even in the midst of his guards.\r\nBut Revilla-Gigedo possessed some of the sterner qualities that\r\ndistinguished his parent, and never rested until the guilty parties\r\nwere discovered and brought to prompt and signal justice. The capital\r\nsoon exhibited a different aspect under his just and rigorous\r\ngovernment. He did not trust alone to the reports of his agents in\r\norder to satisfy his mind in regard to the wants of Mexico; for he\r\nvisited every quarter of the city personally, and often descended\r\nunexpectedly upon his officers when they least expected a visit from\r\nsuch a personage. The poor as well as the rich received his paternal\r\nnotice. He enquired into their wants and studied their interests. One\r\nof his most beneficent schemes was the erection of a Monte Pio, for\r\ntheir relief, yet the sum he destined for this object was withheld by\r\nthe court and used for the payment of royal debts. Agriculture,\r\nhorticulture and botany were especially fostered by this enlightened\r\nnobleman. He carried out the project of his predecessor by founding\r\nthe botanical garden, and liberally rewarded and encouraged the pupils\r\nof this establishment, for he deemed the rich vegetable resources of\r\nMexico quite as worthy of national attention as the mines which had\r\nhitherto absorbed the public interest. Literature, too, did not escape\r\nhis fostering care, as far as the jealous rules of the Inquisition and\r\nof royal policy permitted its liberal encouragement by a viceroy. He\r\nfound the streets of the capital and its suburbs badly paved and kept,\r\nand he rigidly enforced all the police regulations which were\r\nnecessary for their purity and safety. As he knew that one of the best\r\nmeans of developing and binding together the provinces of the empire,\r\nwas the construction of substantial and secure roads,--he proposed\r\nthat the highways to Vera Cruz, Acapulco, Meztitlan de la Sierra, and\r\nToluca, should be reconstructed in the most enduring manner. But the\r\nJunta Superior de Hacienda opposed the measure, and the count was\r\nobliged to expend, from his own purse, the requisite sums for the most\r\nimportant repairs. He established weekly posts between the capitals of\r\nthe Intendencies;--regulated and restricted the cutting of timber in\r\nthe adjacent mountains;--established a professorship of anatomy in the\r\nHospital de Naturales; destroyed the provincial militia system and\r\nformed regular _corps_ out of the best veterans found in the ranks.\r\nKnowing the difficulty with which the poor or uninfluential reached\r\nthe ear of their Mexican governors, he placed a locked case in one of\r\nthe halls of his palace into which all persons were at liberty to\r\nthrow their memorials designed for the viceroy's scrutiny. It was, in\r\nreality, a secret mode of _espionage_, but it brought to the count's\r\nknowledge many an important fact which he would never have learned\r\nthrough the ordinary channels of the court. Without this secret chest,\r\nwhose key was never out of his possession, Revilla-Gigedo, with all\r\nhis personal industry, might never have comprehended the actual\r\ncondition of Mexico, or, have adopted the numerous measures for its\r\nimprovement which distinguished his reign.\r\n\r\nBesides this provident measure for the internal safety and progressive\r\ncomfort of New Spain, the count directed his attention to the western\r\ncoast of America, upon which, he believed, the future interests of\r\nSpain would materially rely. The settlement of the Californias had\r\nengaged the attention of many preceding viceroys, as we have already\r\nrelated, and their coasts had been explored and missionary settlements\r\nmade wherever the indentures of the sea shore indicated the utility of\r\nsuch enterprises. But the count foresaw that the day would come when\r\nthe commercial enterprises of European nations, and, especially of the\r\nEnglish, would render this portion of the Mexican realm an invaluable\r\nacquisition. Accordingly he despatched an expedition to the\r\nCalifornias to secure the possessions of Spain in that quarter; and\r\nhas left, for posterity, an invaluable summary or _recopilacion_ of\r\nall the enterprises of discovery made by the Spaniards in that portion\r\nof the west coast of America. This document,--more useful to the\r\nantiquarian than the politician, now that the boundaries between the\r\npossessions of Mexico, England and the United States have been\r\ndefinitely settled by treaties,--may be found in the third volume of\r\n\"Los Tres Siglos de Mejico,\" a work which was commenced by the Jesuit\r\nFather Cavo, and continued to the year 1821, by Don Carlos Maria\r\nBustamante. Revilla-Gigedo recommended the Spanish court to avoid all\r\nuseless parade or expense, but resolutely to prevent the approach of\r\nthe English or of any other foreign power to their possessions in\r\nCalifornia, and to occupy, promptly, the port of Bodega, and even the\r\nshores of the Columbia river, if it was deemed necessary. He advised\r\nthe minister, moreover, to fortify these two points; to garrison\r\nstrongly San Francisco, Monterey, San Diego and Loreto; to change the\r\ndepartment of San Blas to Acapulco; and to guard the _fondos piadosos_\r\nof the missions, as well as the salt works of Zapotillo, by which the\r\ntreasury would be partly relieved of the ecclesiastical expenses of\r\nCalifornia, while the needful marine force was suitably supported.\r\nThese safeguards were believed by the viceroy sufficient to confine\r\nthe enterprising English to the regions in which they might traffic\r\nfor peltries without being tempted into the dominions of Spain, at the\r\nsame time that they served as safeguards against all illicit or\r\ncontraband commerce.[48]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have, thus endeavored to describe rather than to narrate\r\nhistorically, the principal events that occurred in the reign of the\r\nsecond Count Revilla-Gigedo, all of which have characterized him as a\r\njust, liberal and far-seeing ruler. In the account of his father's\r\nreign, we have already noticed some of this viceroy's meritorious\r\nqualities; but we shall now break the ordinary tenor of these brief\r\nannals by inserting a few anecdotes which are still traditionally\r\ncurrent in the country whose administration he so honestly conducted.\r\n\r\nThe Conde was accustomed to make nightly rounds in the city, in order\r\nto assure himself that its regulations for quiet and security were\r\ncarried into effect. On one occasion, it is related, that in passing\r\nthrough a street which he had ordered to be paved, he suddenly stopped\r\nand despatched a messenger to the director of the work, requiring his\r\ninstant presence. The usual phrase with which he wound up such\r\ncommands was \"lo espero aqui,\"--\"I await him here,\"--which had the\r\neffect of producing an extraordinary degree of celerity in those who\r\nreceived the command. On this occasion the officer, who was enjoying\r\nhis midnight repose, sprang from his bed on receiving the startling\r\nsummons, and rushed, half dressed, to learn the purport of what he\r\npresumed to be an important business. He found the viceroy standing\r\nstiff and composed on the side walk. When the panting officer had paid\r\nhis obeisance to his master:--\"I regret to have disturbed you, Señor,\"\r\nsaid the latter, \"in order to call your attention to the state of your\r\npavement. You will observe that this flag stone is not perfectly\r\neven,\" touching with his toe one which rose about half an inch above\r\nthe rest of the side walk, \"I had the misfortune to strike my foot\r\nagainst it this evening, and I fear that some others may be as unlucky\r\nas myself, unless the fault be immediately remedied. You will attend\r\nto it, sir, and report to me to-morrow morning!\" With these words he\r\ncontinued his round, leaving the officer in a state of stupefaction;\r\nbut it is asserted that the pavements of Mexico for the rest of his\r\nexcellency's government were unexceptionable.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote, of this kind, places his peculiarity of temper in a\r\nstill stronger light. In perambulating the city one pleasant evening\r\nabout sunset, he found that the street in which he was walking\r\nterminated abruptly against a mass of wretched tenements, apparently\r\nthe lurking places of vice and beggary. He inquired how it happened\r\nthat the highway was carried no farther, or why these hovels were\r\nallowed to exist; but the only information he could gain was that such\r\nhad always been the case, and that none of the authorities considered\r\nthemselves bound to remedy the evil. Revilla-Gigedo sent immediately\r\nto the _corregidor_:--\"tell him that I await him here,\" he concluded,\r\nin a tone that had the effect of bringing that functionary at once to\r\nthe spot, and he received orders to open, without delay, a broad and\r\nstraight avenue through the quarter as far as the barrier of the city.\r\nIt must be finished,--was the imperious command,--that very night, so\r\nas to allow the viceroy to drive through it on his way to mass the\r\nnext morning. With this the count turned on his heel, and the\r\ncorregidor was left to reflect upon his disagreeable predicament.\r\n\r\nThe fear of losing his office, or perhaps worse consequences,\r\nstimulated his energy. No time was to be wasted. All his subordinate\r\nofficers were instantly summoned, and laborers were collected from all\r\nparts of the city. The very buildings that were to be removed sent\r\nforth crowds of _leperos_ willing for a few _reales_ to aid in\r\ndestroying the walls which had once harbored them. A hundred torches\r\nshed their radiance over the scene. All night long the shouts of the\r\nworkmen, the noise of pick-axe and crowbar, the crash of falling\r\nroofs, and the rumbling of carts, kept the city in a fever of\r\nexcitement. Precisely at sunrise the state carriage, with the viceroy,\r\nhis family and suite, left the palace, and rattled over the pavements\r\nin the direction from which the noise had proceeded. At length the new\r\nstreet opened before them, a thousand workmen, in double file, fell\r\nback on either side and made the air resound with _vivas_, as they\r\npassed. Through clouds of dust and dirt,--over the unpaved earth,\r\nstrewn with fragments of stone and plaster,--the coach and train swept\r\nonward, till at the junction of the new street with the road leading\r\nto the suburbs, the _corregidor_, hat in hand, with a smile of\r\nconscious desert, stepped forward to receive his excellency, and to\r\nlisten to the commendation bestowed on the prompt and skilful\r\nexecution of his commands!\r\n\r\nShould any one doubt the truth of this story, let him be aware that the\r\nCalle de Revilla-Gigedo still remains in Mexico to attest its verity.\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes impart some idea of the authority exercised by the\r\nviceroys, which was certainly far more arbitrary and personal than\r\nthat of their sovereign in his Spanish dominions.\r\n\r\nThere is another adventure told to display the excellence of\r\nRevilla-Gigedo's police, in which the count figures rather\r\nmelodramatically. It seems that among the _creole_ nobles, who, with\r\nthe high officers of government, made up the viceroy's court, there\r\nwas a certain marques, whom fortune had endowed with great estates and\r\ntwo remarkably pretty daughters, and it was doubted by some whether\r\nthe care of his cash or his heiresses gave him most anxiety. The\r\neldest, who bore her father's title, was celebrated for beauty of an\r\nuncommon kind in those regions. She had blue eyes, brilliant\r\ncomplexion, and golden hair, and was every where known as the fair\r\nhaired marquesa. Her sister who, on the contrary, was very dark, with\r\neyes like the gazelle and raven hair, was called the pretty brunette.\r\nBut, different as they were in looks and perhaps in character, there\r\nwas one trait in which they perfectly agreed, for they were remarkable\r\ncoquettes! It is unknown how many offers of the wealthiest grandees\r\nand most gallant cavaliers about court they had refused; and the poor\r\nmarques, who was by no means a domestic tyrant and desired to govern\r\nhis family only by kindness, was quite worn out in persuading them to\r\nknow there own minds. One night he was roused from his sleep by a\r\nmessage from the viceroy, who awaited him in the palace. Not for his\r\nbest estate would the loyal marques have kept the representative of\r\nhis sovereign waiting a moment longer than necessary. Wondering what\r\nreason of state could require his presence at that unusual hour, he\r\ndressed himself hastily, and hurried to the palace. The viceroy was in\r\nhis cabinet, surrounded by several of his household, and all in a\r\nstate of painful curiosity. \"Marques,\" said the viceroy, as soon as\r\nthe nobleman entered, \"my lieutenant of police here, complains that\r\nyou did not take proper care to secure the doors of your mansion last\r\nevening.\" \"I assure your highness,\" replied the marques in great\r\nsurprise, \"that my steward locked both the great gate and the outer\r\ndoor, according to the invariable custom of my mansion, before\r\nretiring for the night.\" \"But have you not a postern opening into the\r\nnext street?\" returned the count, \"and are you equally heedful in\r\nregard to it? But, in short,\" he continued, \"you must know, that this\r\nwatchful lieutenant of mine has saved you to-night from robbery.\"\r\n\"Robbery! your excellency, is it possible?\" ejaculated the marques,\r\nstartled for a moment out of his habitual composure. \"Yes,--and of the\r\nworst kind\" replied the viceroy, \"the felons were in the act of\r\ncarrying off your most exquisite treasures which are now restored to\r\nyou.\" At these words, a door at the side of the cabinet flew open, and\r\nthe astonished marques beheld his two daughters, dressed for\r\ntravelling, and locked in each other's arms. They seemed overwhelmed\r\nwith confusion; the fair hair all dishevelled and the black eyes\r\ndrowned in tears. \"And these are the robbers,\" added the viceroy\r\npointing to a door on the opposite side, which also flew open. The\r\nmarques turned mechanically, and saw two of the gayest, handsomest,\r\nand most dissipated youths of the court, whom he recollected as\r\noccasional visitors at his house. They appeared no less confused, and,\r\nwith their embarrassment, there was an evident mixture of alarm. The\r\ntruth now began to break on the mind of the nobleman. \"You see,\r\nmarques,\" said the count, \"that but for the vigilance of my police,\r\nyou would have had the honor of being father-in-law to two of the\r\ngreatest scamps in my viceroyalty. See what a dilemma your\r\ncarelessness has brought me into, my dear sir! I am obliged to wound\r\nthe feelings of two of the most lovely ladies in my court, to save\r\nthem from the machinations of scoundrels unworthy of their charms, and\r\nI fear they will never forgive me! Farewell, señor marques; take my\r\nadvice, and brick up your postern. Calderon[49] was a wise man, and he\r\ntells us that a house with two doors is hard to keep.

VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1794-1798.\r\n\r\nThe Marques Branciforte, who reached Mexico on the 11th of July, 1794,\r\ncontrasts unfavorably, in history, with his illustrious predecessor\r\nRevilla-Gigedo. Partaking of the avaricious qualities of this\r\npersonage's father, he seems to have possessed but few of his virtues,\r\nand probably accepted the viceroyalty of New Spain with no purpose but\r\nthat of plunder.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he begun to reign, when his rapacity was signally\r\nexhibited. It is said that his first essay in extortion, was the sale\r\nof the _sub-delegation_ of Villa-Alta to a certain Don Francisco Ruiz\r\nde Conejares, for the sum of forty thousand dollars, and the bestowal\r\nof the office of _apoderado_ on the Count de Contramina, the offices\r\nof whose subordinates were bought and sold in the political market\r\nlike ordinary merchandise.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch the warlike hostility to France was excessive, and\r\norders had been received to exercise the strictest vigilance over the\r\nsubjects of that nation who resided in Mexico. Their number, however,\r\nwas small, for Spanish America was almost as closely sealed as China\r\nagainst the entrance of strangers. Nevertheless Branciforte encouraged\r\na most disgraceful persecution against these unfortunate persons, by\r\narresting them on the slightest pretexts, throwing them into prison,\r\nand seizing their possessions. He found, in his _assessor general_,\r\nDon Pedro Jacinto Valenzuela, and in his criminal prosecutor,\r\nFrancisco Xavier de Borbon, fitting instruments to carry out his\r\ninexorable determinations. Upon one occasion he even demanded of the\r\nSala de Audiencia that certain Frenchmen, after execution, should have\r\ntheir tongues impaled upon iron spikes at the city gates, because they\r\nhad spoken slightingly of the virtue of the queen Maria Louisa!\r\nFortunately, however, for the wretched culprits, the _Sala_ was\r\ncomposed of virtuous magistrates who refused to sanction the cruel\r\ndemand, and the victims were alone despoiled of their valuable\r\nproperty. These acts, it may well be supposed, covered the name of\r\nBranciforte with infamy even in Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, on the 7th of October, war was declared by Spain against\r\nEngland, in consequence of which the viceroy immediately distributed\r\nthe colonial army, consisting of not less than eight thousand men, in\r\nOrizaba, Cordova, Jalapa, and Peroté; and, in the beginning of the\r\nfollowing year, he left the capital to command the forces from his\r\nheadquarters near the eastern coast. This circumstance enabled him to\r\nleave, with an air of triumph, a city in which he was profoundly\r\nhated. The people manifested their contempt of so despicable an\r\nextortioner and flatterer of royalty, not only by words, but by\r\ncaricatures. When the sovereign sent him the order of the golden\r\nfleece, they depicted Branciforte with a collar of the noble order,\r\nbut in lieu of the lamb, which terminates the insignia, they placed\r\nthe figure of a cat! At his departure, the civil and financial\r\ngovernment of the capital was entrusted to the regency of the\r\n_audiencia_, while its military affairs were conducted by the\r\nBrigadier Davalos. In Orizaba the conduct of Branciforte was that of\r\nan absolute monarch. All his troops were placed under the best\r\ndiscipline, but none of them were permitted to descend to Vera Cruz;\r\nyet, scarcely had he been established in this new military command,\r\nwhen it was known that Don Miguel José de Azanza was named as his\r\nviceroyal successor. Nevertheless Branciforte continued in control,\r\nwith the same domineering demeanor, as in the first days of his\r\ngovernment, relying for justification and defence in Spain upon the\r\nsupport of his relative, the Prince of Peace. In Orizaba he was\r\nsurrounded by flatterers and his court was a scene of disgraceful\r\norgies; yet the day of his fall was at hand. The ship Monarch\r\nanchored at Vera Cruz, on the 17th of May, 1798, and, on the 31st of\r\nthe same month, Azanza, the new viceroy who reached America in her,\r\nreceived the viceroyal baton from Branciforte. This supercilious\r\npeculator departed from New Spain with five millions of dollars, a\r\nlarge portion of which was his private property, in the vessel that\r\nhad brought his successor, and arrived at Ferol, after a narrow escape\r\nfrom the English in the waters of Cadiz. But he returned to Spain\r\nloaded with wealth and curses, for never had the Mexicans complained\r\nso bitterly against any Spaniard who was commissioned to rule them.\r\nThe respectable and wealthy inhabitants of the colony were loudest in\r\ntheir denunciations of an \"Italian adventurer,\" who enriched himself\r\nat the expense of their unfortunate country, nor was his conduct less\r\nhateful because he had been the immediate successor of so just and\r\nupright a viceroy as Revilla-Gigedo.\r\n\r\nThe character of Branciforte was keen and hypocritical. He tried, at\r\ntimes, but vainly, to conceal his avarice, while his pretended love\r\nfor the \"Virgin of Guadalupe\" and for the royal family, was\r\nincessantly reiterated in familiar conversation. Every Saturday during\r\nhis government, and on the twelfth of every month, he made pious\r\npilgrimages to the sanctuary of the Mexican protectress. He placed a\r\nlarge image of the virgin on the balcony of the palace, and ordered a\r\nsalute to be fired at daybreak in honor of the saint on the twelfth of\r\nevery December. With these cheap ceremonials, however, he satisfied\r\nhis hypocritical piety and absorbing avarice, but he never bestowed a\r\nfarthing upon the collegiate church of the Virgin. Whenever he spoke\r\nin his court of the sovereign of Spain it was with an humble mien, a\r\nreverential voice, and all the external manifestations of subserviency\r\nfor the royal personages who conferred such unmerited honors upon him.\r\nSuch is the picture which has been left by Mexican annalists of one of\r\ntheir worst rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON MIGUEL JOSÉ DE AZANZA, LIV. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.--1798-1800.\r\n\r\nAzanza, who, as we have related, assumed the viceroyalty in May, 1798,\r\nwas exceedingly well received in Mexico. His worthy character was\r\nalready known to the people, and almost any new viceroy would have been\r\nhailed as a deliverer from the odious administration of Branciforte.\r\nAzanza was urbane towards all classes, and his discreet conversation, at\r\nonce, secured the respect and confidence of the colonists. Besides\r\nthis, the early measures of his administration were exceedingly wise. He\r\ndissolved the various military encampments, established and maintained\r\nat enormous cost, by his predecessor in the neighborhood of the eastern\r\ncoasts. This heavy charge on the treasury was distasteful to the people,\r\nwhile so large an assemblage of colonial troops necessarily withdrew\r\nmultitudes from agricultural and commercial pursuits, and greatly\r\ninterfered with the business of New Spain. Anxious, however, to protect\r\nthe important post of Vera Cruz, the viceroy formed a less numerous\r\nencampment in its neighborhood; but the greater portion of its officers\r\nand men perished in that unhealthy climate.\r\n\r\nThe war with England was not altogether disadvantageous to Mexico, for\r\nalthough the royal order of the 18th of November, 1797, was repeated\r\non the 20th of April, 1799, by which a commerce in neutral vessels had\r\nbeen permitted with the colony's ports, yet, as the seas were filled\r\nwith enemy's cruisers, the Spanish trade in national vessels was\r\nnarrowed chiefly to exports from the mother country. This course of\r\ncommerce resulted in retaining the specie of Mexico within her\r\nterritory, for the precious metals had hitherto been the principal\r\narticle of export to Spain in return for merchandise despatched from\r\nCadiz. The _internal_ trade of Mexico was, accordingly, fostered and\r\nbeneficially sustained by the continuance of its large annual metallic\r\nproducts within the viceroyalty until peace permitted their safe\r\ntransmission abroad. The beneficial retention of silver and gold in\r\nthe country was not only manifested in the activity of domestic trade,\r\nbut in the improvement of its towns and cities, and in the\r\nencouragement of manufactures of silk, cotton and wool. In Oaxaca,\r\nGuadalaxara, Valladolid, Puebla, Cuautitlan, San Juan Teotihuacan,\r\nZempoala, Metepec, Ixtlahuaca, Tulancingo, the number of looms\r\nincreased rapidly between 1796 and 1800. In Oaxaca thirty were added;\r\nin San Juan Teotihuacan thirty-three; in Querétaro, three thousand\r\nfour hundred persons were employed; while, in the town of Cadereita,\r\nthere existed more than two hundred looms, giving employment to more\r\nthan five hundred individuals.\r\n\r\nIn attending wisely and justly to the civil administration of New\r\nSpain, and in fostering the internal trade and industry, Azanza\r\nbestirred himself whilst the war continued. There were but few actions\r\nbetween the combatants, but as the contest between the nations sealed\r\nthe ports in a great degree, Mexico was made chiefly dependent on\r\nherself for the first time since her national existence. The politics\r\nand intrigues of the old world thus acquainted the colony with her\r\nresources and taught her the value of independence.\r\n\r\nAzanza's administration was, for a while, disturbed by a threatened\r\noutbreak among the lower classes, whose chief conspirators assembled\r\nin an obscure house in the capital, and designed, at a suitable\r\nmoment, rising in great numbers and murdering, without discrimination,\r\nall the wealthiest or most distinguished _Spaniards_. This treasonable\r\nproject was discovered to the viceroy, who went in person, with a\r\nguard, to the quarters of the leaguers, and arrested them on the spot.\r\nThey were speedily brought to trial; but the cause hung in the courts\r\nuntil after the departure of Azanza, when powerful and touching\r\nintercessions were made with his successor to save the lives of the\r\nculprits. The project of a pardon was maturely considered by the\r\nproper authorities, and it was resolved not to execute the guilty\r\nchiefs, inasmuch as it was believed that their appearance upon a\r\nscaffold would be the signal for a general revolt of the people\r\nagainst the dominion of the parent country. The sounds of the\r\napproaching storm were already heard in the distance, and justice\r\nyielded to policy.\r\n\r\nAzanza, with all his excellent qualities as a Governor in America, did\r\nnot give satisfaction to the court at home. There is no doubt of the\r\nvalue of his administration in Mexico, and it is, therefore, difficult\r\nto account for his loss of favor, except upon the ground of intrigue and\r\ncorruption which were rife in Madrid. The reign of Charles IV. and the\r\nadministration of the Prince of Peace, are celebrated in history as the\r\nleast respectable in modern Spanish annals. Whilst the royal favorite\r\ncontrolled the king's councils, favoritism and intrigue ruled the day.\r\nAmong other legends of the time, it is asserted by Bustamante, in his\r\ncontinuation of Cavo's \"_Tres Siglos de Mejico_,\" that the Mexican\r\nviceroyalty was almost put up at auction in Madrid, and offered for\r\neighty thousand dollars to the secretary Bonilla. In consequence of this\r\npersonage's inability to procure the requisite sum, it was conferred,\r\nthrough another bargain and sale, upon Don Felix Berenguer de Marquina,\r\nan obscure officer, who was unknown to the king either personally or as\r\na meritorious servant of the crown and people.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican author to whom we have just referred, characterizes Azanza\r\nas the wisest, most politic and amiable viceroy, ever sent by Spain to\r\nrule over his beautiful country.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nDON FELIX BERENGUER DE MARQUINA, LV. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN. 1800-1802.\r\n\r\nMarquina took charge of the viceroyalty on the 30th of April 1800,\r\nafter a sudden and mysterious arrival in New Spain, having passed\r\nthrough the enemy's squadron and been taken prisoner. It was\r\ninconceivable to the Mexicans why the vice-admiral of Jamaica deemed\r\nit proper to release a Spanish officer who came to America on a\r\nwarlike mission; yet it is now known that in November, of 1800, the\r\nking ordered forty thousand dollars to be paid the viceroy to\r\nreimburse the _extraordinary_ expenses of his voyage!\r\n\r\nThe government of this personage was not remarkable in the development\r\nof the colony. The war with England still continued, but it was of a\r\nmild character, and vessels constantly passed between the belligerants\r\nwith flags of truce, through whose intervention the Mexicans were\r\npermitted to purchase in Jamaica the paper, quicksilver, and European\r\nstuffs, which the British crusiers had captured from Spanish ships in\r\nthe Gulf.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, an Indian named Mariano, of Tepic in Jalisco, son of the\r\ngovernor of the village of Tlascala in that department, attempted to\r\nexcite a revolution among the people of his class, by means of an\r\nanonymous circular which proclaimed him king. Measures were immediately\r\ntaken to suppress this outbreak, and numbers of the natives were\r\napprehended and carried to Guadalajara. The fears of Marquina were\r\ngreatly excited by this paltry rebellion, which he imagined, or feigned\r\nto believe, a wide spread conspiracy excited by the NORTH AMERICANS and\r\ndesigned to overthrow the Spanish power. The viceroy, accordingly,\r\ndetailed his services in exaggerated terms to the home government, and\r\nit is probably owing to the eulogium passed by him upon the conduct of\r\nAbascal, president of Guadalaxara, that this personage was made viceroy\r\nof Buenos Ayres, and afterwards honored with the government of Peru and\r\ncreated Marques de la Concordia.\r\n\r\nA definitive treaty of peace was concluded between the principal\r\nEuropean and American belligerants in 1802, and soon after, Marquina,\r\nwho was offended by some slights received from the Spanish ministry,\r\nresigned an office for the performance of whose manifold duties and\r\nintricate labors he manifested no ability save that of a good\r\ndisposition. He was probably better fitted to govern a village of\r\nfifty inhabitants than the vast and important empire of New Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JOSÉ ITURRIGARAY, LIEUTENANT GENERAL OF THE SPANISH ARMY, LVI.\r\nVICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.--1803-1808.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th of January, 1803, Don José Iturrigaray\r\nreached Guadalupe near Mexico, where he received the staff of office\r\nfrom his predecessor and was welcomed by the Audiencia, tribunals, and\r\nnobility of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in the British provinces of North America had been\r\nsuccessful, and they had consolidated themselves into nationality\r\nunder the title of United States. France followed in the footsteps of\r\nliberty, and, overthrowing the rotten throne of the Bourbons, was the\r\nfirst European state to give an impulse to freedom in the old world.\r\nThe whole western part of that continent was more or less agitated by\r\nthe throes of the moral and political volcano whose fiery eruption was\r\nsoon to cover Europe with destruction. In the midst of this epoch of\r\nconvulsive change, Spain alone exhibited the aspect of passive\r\ninsignificance, for the king, queen, and Prince of Peace, still\r\nconducted the government of that great nation, and their corrupt rule\r\nhas become a proverb of imbecility and contempt. Godoy, the misnamed\r\n\"Prince of Peace,\" was the virtual ruler of the nation. His\r\nadministration was, at once, selfish, depraved and silly. The favorite\r\nof the king, and the alleged paramour of the queen, he controlled both\r\nwhenever it was necessary, while the colonies, as well as the parent\r\nstate, naturally experienced all the evil consequences of his\r\ndebauched government. Bad as had been the management of affairs in\r\nAmerica during the reign of the long series of viceroys who commanded\r\non our continent, it became even worse whilst Godoy swayed Charles IV.\r\nthrough the influence of his dissolute queen. Most of the serious and\r\nexciting annoyances which afterwards festered and broke out in the\r\nMexican revolution, owe their origin to this epoch of Spanish misrule.\r\n\r\nIturrigaray was exceedingly well received in Mexico, where his\r\nreputation as an eminent servant of the crown preceded him. Shortly\r\nafter his arrival he undertook a journey to the interior, in order to\r\nexamine personally into the condition of the mining districts; and,\r\nafter his return to the capital, he devoted himself to the ordinary\r\nroutine of colonial administration until it became necessary, in\r\nconsequence of the breaking out of the war, between Spain and England,\r\nto adopt measures for the protection of his viceroyalty. In\r\nconsequence of this rupture Iturrigaray received orders from the\r\ncourt to put the country in a state of complete defence, and\r\naccordingly, he gathered, in haste the troops of Mexico, Puebla,\r\nPeroté, Jalapa and Vera Cruz, and, descending several times to the\r\nlatter place, personally inspected all the encampments and garrisons\r\nalong the route. Besides this, he made a rapid military reconnoissance\r\nof the country along the coast and the chief highways to the interior.\r\nThe road from Vera Cruz to Mexico was constructed in the best manner\r\nunder his orders, and the celebrated bridge called _El Puente del\r\nrey_, now known as _El Puente Nacional_, was finally completed.\r\n\r\nThese preparations were designed not only to guard New Spain from the\r\ninvasions of the English, but also, from a dreaded attack by the\r\npeople of the United States. This fear seems to have been fostered by\r\nthe Marques de Casa Irujo who was Spanish envoy in Washington at this\r\nepoch, and informed the government that the menaced expedition against\r\nMexico, would throw twenty thousand men upon her shores. Nor was the\r\nattention of Iturrigaray diverted from the enterprise which was\r\nprojected by Don Francisco Miranda to secure the independence of\r\nCaraccas; and although the scheme failed, it appears to have aroused\r\nthe whole of Spanish America to assert and maintain its rights.\r\n\r\nIt was during the government of this viceroy, that the celebrated\r\nBaron Humboldt, visited Mexico,--by permission of the patriotic\r\nminister D'Urquijo,--authorized, by the home government, to examine\r\nits dominions and their archives, and to receive from the colonial\r\nauthorities all the information they possessed in regard to America.\r\nHe was the first writer who developed the resources or described the\r\ncondition of the Spanish portion of our continent, which, until that\r\ntime, had been studiously veiled from the examination of all strangers\r\nwho were likely to reveal their knowledge to the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, the news of the destruction of the combined fleets in the\r\nwaters of Cadiz became known in Mexico, and the resident Spaniards,\r\nexhibiting a lively sympathy with the mother country in this sad\r\naffliction, collected upwards of thirty thousand dollars for the\r\nwidows of their brave companions who had fallen in action. Meanwhile,\r\nthe war in Europe was not only destroying the subjects of the\r\ndesperate belligerants, but was rapidly consuming their national\r\nsubstance. In this state of things America was called upon to\r\ncontribute for the maintenance of a bloody struggle in which she had\r\nno interest save that of loyal dependence. Taxes, duties, and\r\nexactions of all sorts were laid upon the Mexicans, and, under this\r\ndread infliction, the domestic and foreign trade languished\r\nnotwithstanding the extraordinary yield of the mines, which, in 1805,\r\nsent upwards of twenty millions into circulation. Of all the royal\r\ninterferences with Mexican interests and capital, none seems to have\r\nbeen more vexatiously unpopular, than the decree for the consolidation\r\nof the capitals of _obras pias_, or, charitable and pious revenues,\r\nwhich was issued by the court; and Iturrigaray, as the executive\r\nofficer employed in this consolidation, drew upon himself the general\r\nodium of all the best classes in the colony.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. fell before the revolutionary storm in Europe, and signed\r\nhis abdication on the 9th of August, 1808, in favor of his son\r\nFerdinand VII. But the weak and irresolute monarch soon protested\r\nagainst this abdication, alleging that the act had been extorted from\r\nhim by threats against his life; and, whilst the Supreme council of\r\nSpain was examining into the validity of Charles's renunciation, and\r\nFerdinand was treating his father's protest with contempt, Napoleon,\r\nwho had steadily advanced to supreme power after the success of the\r\nFrench revolution, took prompt advantage of the dissentions in the\r\npeninsula, and, making himself master of it, seated his brother Joseph\r\non the Spanish throne. As soon as Joseph was firmly placed in power,\r\nFerdinand congratulated him upon his elevation, and ordered all his\r\nSpanish and colonial subjects to recognize the upstart king. But the\r\nservility of Ferdinand to the ascending star of European power did not\r\nmeet with obedience from the people of Mexico, who, resolving to\r\ncontinue loyal to their legitimate sovereign, forthwith proclaimed\r\nFerdinand VII. throughout New Spain. The conduct of the colonists was\r\nsecretly approved by the dissembling monarch, although he ratified a\r\ndecree of the Council of the Indies, commanding the Mexicans to obey\r\nJoseph. The natives of the Peninsula, dwelling in New Spain, were\r\nnearly all opposed to the Bourbons and faithful to the French\r\npropagandists, whilst the creoles, or American natives denounced the\r\nadherents of Joseph and burned the proclamation which declared him to\r\nbe their king. The orders received at this period by Iturrigaray from\r\nFerdinand, Joseph, and the Council of the Indies, were, of course, all\r\nin conflict with each other; and, in order to relieve himself from the\r\npolitical dilemma in which he was placed by these mixed commands,\r\nIturrigaray determined to summon a _Junta_ of Notable Persons, similar\r\nto that of Seville, which was to be composed of the viceroy, the\r\narchbishop of Mexico and representatives from the army, the nobility,\r\nthe principal citizens and the ayuntamiento of the capital. But\r\ninasmuch as this plan of concord leaned in favor of the people, by\r\nproposing to place the _creoles of America_ upon an equality with the\r\n_natives of Spain_, the old hatred or jealousy between the races was\r\nat once aroused. The Europeans, who composed the partisans of France,\r\nheaded by Don Gabriel Yermo, a rich Spaniard and proprietor of some of\r\nthe finest sugar estates in the valley of Cuernavaca, at once resolved\r\nto frustrate the viceroy's design. Arming themselves hastily, they\r\nproceeded, on the night of the 15th of September, 1808, to his palace,\r\nwhere they arrested Iturrigaray, and accusing him of heresy and\r\ntreason, sent him as prisoner to Spain. This revolutionary act was\r\nopenly countenanced by the Audiencia, the Oidores Aguirre and\r\nBataller, and the body of Spanish traders. For three years, until\r\nreleased by an act of amnesty in 1811, Iturrigaray continued in close\r\nconfinement; and, although he was not regarded favorably by all\r\nclasses of Mexicans, this outrage against his person by the Spanish\r\nemigrants seems to have produced a partial reaction in his favor among\r\nthe loyal natives.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Iturrigaray was not only defective, but corrupt\r\nin many executive acts, for offices were scandalously sold at his\r\ncourt,--a fact which was proved in the judicial inquiry subsequently\r\nmade into his conduct. The Council of the Indies, in 1819, sentenced\r\nhim to pay upwards of three hundred and eighty-four thousand dollars,\r\nin consequence of the maladministration that was charged and\r\nmaintained against him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD MARSHAL DON PEDRO GARIBAY, LVII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.--1808.\r\n\r\nThis chief was more than eighty years of age when honored with the\r\nviceroyalty of New Spain. He had passed the greater portion of his\r\nlife in Mexico, and rose from the humble grade of lieutenant of\r\nprovincial militia to the highest post in the colony. He was familiar\r\nwith the habits and feelings of the people; was generally esteemed for\r\nthe moderation with which he conducted himself in office, and was\r\naltogether the most endurable viceroy who could have been imposed upon\r\nthe Mexicans at that revolutionary period.\r\n\r\nDuring the government of the preceding viceroy the troubles which\r\nbegan, as we have seen, in the old world, had extended to the new, and\r\nwe shall therefore group the history of the war that resulted in\r\nMexican independence, under the titles of the last viceroys who were\r\nempowered by Peninsular authorities to stay, if they could not\r\nentirely control, the progress of American liberty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Cavo y Bustamante: Tres Siglos de Mejico, tomo 3^o, 190.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK III.\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION OF THE VICEROYAL GOVERNMENT;\r\n  HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION AND\r\n  WAR OF INDEPENDENCE;\r\n  MEXICO UNDER THE EMPIRE OF ITURBIDE\r\n  AND UNDER THE REPUBLIC;\r\n  WAR WITH TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES\r\n  1809-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1809-1810.\r\n\r\n    LIANZA VICEROY.--AUDIENCIA.--VENEGAS VICEROY.--TRUE SOURCES OF THE\r\n    REVOLUTION.--CREOLES LOYAL TO FERDINAND.--SPANIARDS IN FAVOR OF\r\n    KING JOSEPH.--MEXICAN SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR SPAIN.--SECRET UNION IN\r\n    MEXICO AGAINST SPANIARDS.--HIDALGO--ALLENDE--FIRST OUTBREAK.--\r\n    GUANAJUATO SACKED--LAS CRUCES.--MEXICO MENACED.--INDIAN BRAVERY\r\n    AT ACULCO.--MARFIL--MASSACRE AT GUANAJUATO--CALLEJA.-- INSURGENTS\r\n    DEFEATED--EXECUTION OF HIDALGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHBISHOP FRANCISCO XAVIER DE LIANZA, LVIII. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. THE AUDIENCIA OF MEXICO, AND VENEGAS, LIX. VICEROY. 1809-1810.\r\n\r\nThe pictures presented in the introductory chapter to the viceroyal\r\nhistory and in the subsequent detailed narrative of that epoch, will\r\nsuffice, we presume, to convince our readers that they need not\r\npenetrate deeply for the true causes of misery and misrule in Spanish\r\nAmerica. The decadence of Spain as well as the present unhappiness of\r\nnearly all her ancient colonies may be fairly attributed to the same\r\nsource of national ruin--bad, unnatural government. A distinguished\r\nstatesman of our country has remarked that \"the European alliance of\r\nemperors and kings assumed, as the foundation of human society, the\r\ndoctrine of unalienable allegiance, whilst our doctrine was founded on\r\nthe principle of unalienable right.\"[51] This mistaken European view,\r\nor rather assumption of royal prerogative and correlative human\r\nduties, was the baleful origin of colonial misrule. The house of\r\nAustria did not govern Spain as wisely as its predecessors. The Spain\r\nthat Philip I. received and the Spain of those who followed him,\r\npresent a sad contrast. As the conquest of America had not been\r\nconceived, although it was declared to be, in a beneficent spirit, the\r\nsovereigns continued the system of plunder with which it was begun.\r\nIts results are known. The Americans were their subjects, bound to\r\nthem by \"unalienable allegiance;\" vassals, serfs creatures, whose\r\nhuman rights, in effect, were nothing when compared to the monarch's\r\nwill. This doctrine at once converted the southern portions of our\r\ncontinent into a soulless machine, which the king had a right to use\r\nas he pleased, and especially, as he deemed most beneficial for his\r\ndomestic realm. The consequence was, that, in concurrence with the\r\nCouncil of the Indies, he established, as we have seen, an entirely\r\nartificial system, which contradicted nature, and utterly thwarted\r\nboth physical and intellectual development.\r\n\r\nThe Indians and creoles of Mexico and Peru, ignorant and stupid as\r\nthey were believed to be by Spain, had, nevertheless, sense enough to\r\nunderstand and feel the wretchedness of their condition. They\r\ncherished in their hearts an intense hatred for their foreign masters.\r\nThere was no positive or merely natural enmity of races in this, but\r\nrather a suppressed desire to avenge their wrongs.\r\n\r\nWhen the French seized Spain, the colonies in America were, for a\r\nperiod, forced to rely upon themselves for temporary government. They\r\ndid not, at once, desire to adopt republican institutions, but rather\r\nadhered to monarchy, provided they could free themselves from bad\r\nrulers and vicious laws. This especially was the case in Mexico. Her\r\nwar against the mother country originated in a loyal desire to be\r\ncompletely independent of France. The news of the departure of\r\nFerdinand VII. for Bayonne, and the alleged perfidy of Napoleon in\r\nthat city, excited an enthusiasm among the Mexicans for the legitimate\r\nking, and created a mortal hatred against the conqueror of Europe. All\r\nclasses of original Mexican society seem to have been united in these\r\nsentiments. Subscriptions were freely opened and in a few months,\r\nseven millions were collected to aid their Peninsular friends who were\r\nfighting for religion, king, and nationality. The idea did not strike\r\nany Mexican that it was a proper time to free his native land entirely\r\nfrom colonial thraldom.[52] But after a short time, the people began\r\nto reflect. The _prestige_ of Spanish power, to which we have alluded\r\nheretofore, was destroyed. A French king sat upon the Spanish throne.\r\nThe wand of the enchanter, with which he had spell-bound America\r\nacross the wide Atlantic, was broken forever. The treasured memory of\r\noppression, conquest, bad government and misery, was suddenly\r\nrefreshed, and it is not surprising to find that when the popular\r\nrising finally took place, it manifested its bitterness in an\r\nuniversal outcry against the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAfter the occurrences at Bayonne, emissaries from king Joseph\r\nBonaparte spread themselves over the continent to prepare the people\r\nfor the ratification and permanence of the French government. These\r\npolitical propagandists were charged, as we have stated with orders\r\nfrom Ferdinand VII. and the Council of the Indies, to transfer the\r\nallegiance of America to France.[53] It may be imagined that this\r\nwould have gratified the masses in America, who perhaps, had heard\r\nthat the French were the unquestionable patrons of \"liberty and\r\nequality.\" But, the exact reverse was the case among the creoles,\r\nwhilst the _Spaniards_ in America, received the emissaries with\r\nwelcome, and bowed down submissively to the orders they brought.\r\nBlinded for centuries to all ideas of government save those of regal\r\ncharacter, the Mexicans had no notion of rule or ruler except their\r\ntraditionary Spanish king. They clung to him, therefore, with\r\nconfidence, for they felt the necessity of some paramount authority,\r\nas political self control was, as yet, an utter impossibility.\r\n\r\nA secret union among leading men was, therefore, formed in 1810, which\r\ncontemplated a general rising throughout the provinces, but the plot\r\nwas detected at the moment when it was ripe for development. This\r\nconspiracy was based upon a desire to _overthrow the Spaniards_. \"They\r\nfelt,\" says Mr. Ward, \"that the question was not now one between\r\nthemselves as subjects, but between themselves and their fellow\r\nsubjects, the European Spaniards, as to which should possess the right\r\nof representing the absent king,\" as guardians and preservers of the\r\nrights of Ferdinand. The Europeans claimed this privilege exclusively,\r\nwith customary insolence. \"The Ayuntamiento of Mexico was told by the\r\nAudiencia that it possessed no authority except over the\r\n_leperos_\"--or mob of the capital; and it was a favorite maxim of the\r\noidor Battaller that \"while a Manchego mule or a Castilian cobler\r\nremained in the Peninsula, he had a right to govern.\"[54]\r\n\r\nIn those times, a certain country curate, by name Miguel Hidalgo y\r\nCostilla, dwelt in the Indian village of Dolores, adjacent to the town\r\nof San Miguel el Grande, lying in the province of Guanajuanto. One of\r\nthe conspirators being about to die, sent for his priest, and\r\nconfessing the plot, revealed also the names of his accomplices. The\r\ncurate Hidalgo was one of the chiefs of this revolutionary band, and\r\nthe viceroy Venegas hoping to crush the league in its bud, despatched\r\norders for his arrest and imprisonment, as soon as the confession of\r\nthe dead conspirator was disclosed to him. Hidalgo's colleagues were\r\nalso included in this order, but some of the secret friends of the\r\ninsurgents learned what was occurring at court and apprised the\r\npatriot priest of his imminent danger. The news first reached Don\r\nIgnacio Allende, who commanded a small body of the king's troops in\r\nSan Miguel, and who hastened with the disastrous tidings to his friend\r\nat Dolores. Concealment and flight were now equally unavailing. The\r\ntroops of Allende were speedily won to the cause of their captain,\r\nwhile the Indians of Dolores rushed to defend their beloved pastor. As\r\nthey marched from their village to San Miguel and thence to Zelaya,\r\nthe natives, armed with clubs, slings, staves and missiles, thronged\r\nto their ranks from every mountain and valley. The wretched equipment\r\nof the insurgents shows their degraded condition as well as the\r\npassionate fervor with which they blindly rushed upon the enemies of\r\ntheir race. Hidalgo put on his military coat over the cassock, and,\r\nperhaps unwisely, threw himself at the head of a revolution, which\r\nrallied at the cry of \"_Death to the Gachupines_.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThe result of this onslaught was dreadful. Wherever the rebellious\r\narmy passed, Spaniards and uncomplying creoles they were\r\nindiscriminately slaughtered, and though many of the latter were\r\noriginally combined with the conspirators and eagerly longed for the\r\nemancipation of their country, they were dismayed by the atrocities of\r\nthe wild insurgents. As the rebel chief, armed with the sword and\r\ncross, pressed onward, immense numbers of Indians flocked to his\r\nbanner, so that when he left Zelaya, a fierce and undisciplined mob of\r\ntwenty thousand hailed him as undisputed commander. At the head of\r\nthis predatory band he descended upon the noble city of Guanajuanto,\r\nin the heart of the wealthiest mining district of Mexico. The\r\nSpaniards and some of the creoles resolved upon a stout resistance,\r\nshut themselves up in the city and refused the humane terms offered by\r\nHidalgo upon condition of surrender. This rash rejection led to an\r\nimmediate attack and victory. When the city fell, it was too late for\r\nthe insurgent priest to stay the savage fury of his troops. The\r\nSpaniards and their adherents were promiscuously slaughtered by the\r\ntroops, and, for three days the sacking of the city continued, until\r\nwearied with conquest, the rebels, at length, stopped the plunder of\r\nthe town. Immense treasures, hoarded in this place for many years,\r\nwere the fruits of this atrocious victory which terrified the Mexican\r\nauthorities and convinced them that the volcanic nature of the people\r\nhad been fully roused, and that safety existed alone in uncompromising\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe original rebellion was thus thrown from the hands of the creoles\r\ninto those of the Indians. A war of _races_ was about to break out;\r\nand although there were not among the insurgents more than a thousand\r\nmuskets, yet the mere numerical force of such an infuriate crowd, was\r\nsufficient to dismay the staunchest. The viceroy Venegas, and the\r\nchurch, therefore, speedily combined to hurl their weapons against the\r\nrebels. Whilst the former issued proclamations or decrees, and\r\ndespatched troops under the command of Truxillo to check Hidalgo who\r\nwas advancing on the capital, the latter declared all the rebels to be\r\nheretics, and excommunicated them in a body. Venegas ordered all the\r\nhigher clergy \"to represent from the pulpit, and circulate the idea\r\nprivately, that the great object of the revolution was to destroy and\r\nsubvert the holy Catholic religion, while he directed the subaltern\r\nministers to sow discord in families by the confessional.\"[56] But the\r\narms of the Spanish chiefs and the anathemas of the Roman church, were\r\nunequal to the task of resistance. Hidalgo was attacked by Truxillo at\r\nLas Cruces, about eight leagues from the capital, where the Indian\r\narmy overwhelmed the Spanish general and drove him back to Mexico,\r\nwith the loss of his artillery. In this action we find it difficult to\r\napportion the ferocity, with justice, between the combatants, for\r\nTruxillo boasted in his despatch that he had defended the defile with\r\nthe \"obstinacy of Leonidas,\" and had even \"fired upon the bearers of a\r\nflag of truce which Hidalgo sent him.\"[57]\r\n\r\nThe insurgents followed up their success at Las Cruces by pursuing the\r\nfoe until they arrived at the _hacienda_ of Quaximalpa, within fifteen\r\nmiles of the city of Mexico. But here a fatal distrust of his powers\r\nseems first to have seized the warrior priest. Venegas, it is said,\r\ncontrived to introduce secret emmissaries into his camp, who impressed\r\nHidalgo and his officers with the belief that the capital was\r\nabundantly prepared for defence, and that an assault upon the\r\ndisciplined troops of Spain, by a disordered multitude without fire\r\narms, would only terminate in the rout and destruction of all his\r\nforces. In fact, he seems to have been panic stricken, and to have\r\nfelt unable to control the revolutionary tempest he had raised.\r\nAccordingly, in an evil moment for his cause, he commenced a retreat,\r\nafter having remained several days in sight of the beautiful city of\r\nMexico, upon which he might easily have swept down from the mountain\r\nlike an eagle to his prey.\r\n\r\nIt is related by the historians of these wars, that in spite of all\r\nVenegas's boasted valor and assurance, he was not a little dismayed by\r\nthe approach of Hidalgo. The people shared his alarm, and would\r\nprobably have yielded at once to the insurgents, whose imposing forces\r\nwere crowding into the valley. But in this strait the viceroy had\r\nrecourse to the well known superstitions of the people, in order to\r\nallay their fears. He caused the celebrated image of the Virgin of\r\nRemedios to be brought from the mountain village, where it was\r\ngenerally kept in a chapel, to the cathedral, with great pomp and\r\nceremony. Thither he proceeded, in full uniform, to pay his respects\r\nto the figure, and after imploring the Virgin to take the government\r\ninto her own hands, he terminated his appeal by laying his baton of\r\ncommand at her feet.[58]\r\n\r\nIt is now that we first encounter in Mexican history the name of Don\r\nFelix Maria Calleja,--a name that is coupled with all that is\r\nshameless, bloody, and atrocious, in modern warfare. Calleja was\r\nplaced at the head of a well appointed creole army of ten thousand men\r\nand a train of artillery, and with these disciplined forces, which he\r\nhad been for some time concentrating, he was ordered to pursue\r\nHidalgo.[59] The armies met at Aculco, and the Indians, in their first\r\nencounter with a body of regulars, exhibited an enthusiastic bravery\r\nthat nearly defies belief. They were almost as completely ignorant of\r\nthe use or power of fire arms as their Aztec ancestors three hundred\r\nyears before. They threw themselves upon the serried ranks of infantry\r\nwith clubs and staves. Rushing up to the mouths of the cannon they\r\ndrove their _sombreros_ or hats of straw, into the muzzles. Order,\r\ncommand, or discipline, were entirely unknown to them. Their effort\r\nwas simply to overwhelm by superiority of numbers. But the cool\r\nphalanx of creoles stood firm, until the Indian disorder became so\r\ngreat, and their strength so exhausted by repeated yet fruitless\r\nefforts, that the regulars commenced the work of slaughter with\r\nimpunity. Calleja boasts that Hidalgo lost \"ten thousand men, of whom\r\nfive thousand were put to the sword.\" It seems, however, that he was\r\nunable to capture or disband the remaining insurgents; for Hidalgo\r\nretreated to Guanajuato, and then fell back on Guadalaxara, leaving in\r\nthe former city a guard under his friend Allende.\r\n\r\nCalleja next attacked the rebel forces at the hacienda of Marfil, and\r\nhaving defeated Allende, who defended himself bravely, rushed onward\r\ntowards the city of Guanajuato. This place he entered as conqueror.\r\n\"The sacrifice of the prisoners of Marfil,\" says Robinson, \"was not\r\nsufficient to satiate his vindictive spirit.\" He glutted his vengeance\r\non the defenceless population of Guanajuato. Men, women and children,\r\nwere driven by his orders, into the great square; and fourteen\r\nthousand of these wretches, it is alleged, were butchered in a most\r\nbarbarous manner. Their throats were cut. The principal fountain of\r\nthe city literally overflowed with blood. But, far from concealing\r\nthese savage acts, Calleja, in his account of the conflict, exults in\r\nthe honor of communicating the intelligence that he had purged the\r\ncity of its rebellious population. The only apology offered for the\r\nsacrifice was that it would have wasted too much powder to have shot\r\nthem, and therefore, on the principle of economy he cut their throats.\r\nThus was this unfortunate city, in a single campaign, made the victim\r\nof both loyalists and insurgents.\r\n\r\nHidalgo and his division were soon joined by Allende, and although they\r\nsuffered all the disasters of a bad retreat as well as of Spanish\r\nvictories, he still numbered about eighty thousand under his banners. He\r\nawaited Calleja at Guadalaxara, which he had surrounded with\r\nfortifications and armed with cannon, dragged by the Indians, over\r\nmountain districts from the port of San Blas, on the Pacific; but it is\r\npainful to record the fact, that in this city Hidalgo was guilty of\r\ngreat cruelties to all the Europeans. Ward relates that between seven\r\nand eight hundred victims fell beneath the assassin's blade. A letter,\r\nproduced on Hidalgo's trial, written to one of his lieutenants, charges\r\nthe officer to seize as many Spaniards as he possibly can, and,\r\nmoreover, directs him, if he has any reason to suspect his prisoners of\r\nentertaining seditious or restless ideas, to bury them at once in\r\noblivion by putting such persons to death in some secret and solitary\r\nplace, where their fate may remain forever unknown! As the cruelty of\r\nOld Spain to the Mexicans had well nigh driven them to despair, such\r\nsavage assassinations, in turn, drove the Spaniards to revenge, or, at\r\nleast furnished them with an excuse for their horrible atrocities.\r\n\r\nCalleja, intent on the pursuit of his Indian prey, was not long in\r\nfollowing Hidalgo. The insurgent chief endeavored to excite the ardor\r\nof his troops, while he preserved some show of discipline in their\r\nranks; and, thus prepared, he gave battle to the Spaniards, at the\r\nbridge of Calderon, on the 17th of January, 1811. At first Hidalgo,\r\nwas successful, but the rebels were no match for the royal troops kept\r\nin reserve by Calleja. With these he made a fierce charge upon the\r\nIndians, and sweeping through their broken masses he \"pursued and\r\nmassacred them by thousands.\"\r\n\r\nCalleja was not a person either to conciliate or to pause in victory. He\r\nbelieved that rebellion could only be rooted out by utter destruction of\r\nthe insurgents and their seed. Accordingly orders were issued to\r\n\"exterminate the inhabitants of every town or village that showed\r\nsymptoms of adherence to the rebels,\" whilst, from the pulpit, new\r\ndenunciations were fulminated against all who opposed the royal\r\nauthority. The insurgent chiefs fled, and reached Saltillo with about\r\nfour thousand men. There it was resolved to leave Rayon in command,\r\nwhile Hidalgo, Allende, Aldama and Absolo endeavored to reach the United\r\nStates with an escort for the purpose of purchasing munitions of war\r\nwith the treasure they had saved from the sacking of Guanajuato. But\r\nthese fierce and vindictive soldiers were destined to end their lives by\r\ntreachery. Hidalgo's associate rebel, Ignacio Elizondo, hoping to make\r\nhis peace with the government by betraying so rich a prize, delivered\r\nthem up to the authorities on the 21st of March, 1811, at Acatila de\r\nBajan. Hidalgo was taken to Chihuahua, and, after being degraded from\r\nholy orders, was shot on the 27th of July, whilst Calleja was rewarded\r\nfor his victories with the title of Conde de Calderon, won by his\r\nbrilliant charge at the bridge near Guanajuato.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the warfare between the Sylla and Marius of this\r\ncontinent, and of some of the most prominent events in the origin of\r\nthat revolution which finally resulted in the Mexican independence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: John Quincy Adams's letter to Mr. Anderson, minister to\r\nColumbia, May 27, 1823.

VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1810-1813.\r\n\r\nAfter Hidalgo's death the country was for a considerable time involved\r\nin a _guerilla_ warfare which extended throughout the whole territory\r\nof Mexico, to the _provincas internas_ of the north Rayon assumed\r\ncommand of the fragments of Hidalgo's forces at Saltillo and retired\r\nto Zacatecas, but he had no command, or indeed authority, except over\r\nhis own men. The whole country was in ferment. The valley of Mexico\r\nwas full of eager partisans, who _lazo'd_ the sentinels even at the\r\ngates of the town; yet, in all the chief cities, the viceroy's\r\nauthority was still permanently acknowledged.\r\n\r\nMen of reflection immediately saw that the cause of liberation would\r\nbe lost, if, amid all these elements of boiling discontent, there was\r\nno unity of opinion and action. The materials of success were ample\r\nthroughout the nation; but they required organization under men in\r\nwhose judgment and bravery the insurgent masses could rely.\r\n\r\nSuch were the opinions of Rayon and his friends, who, in May, 1811,\r\noccupied Zitacuaro, when on the 10th of the following September, they\r\nassembled a Junta, or, central government, composed of five members\r\nchosen by a large body of the most respectable landed proprietors in\r\nthe neighborhood, in conjunction with the Ayuntamiento and inhabitants\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of this Junta were liberal, but they maintained a close\r\nintimacy with Spain, and even admitted the people's willingness to\r\nreceive Ferdinand VII. as sovereign of Mexico provided he abandoned\r\nhis European possessions for New Spain. When Morelos, joined the Junta\r\nhe disapproved this last concession to the royalists, though it was\r\nchiefly defended by Rayon as an expedient measure when dealing with\r\npeople over whom the name of king still exercised the greatest\r\ninfluence. This Junta was finally merged in the congress of\r\nChilpanzingo. Its manifesto, directed to the viceroy in March, 1812,\r\nis worthy of rememberance, as it contains the several doctrines of the\r\nrevolution admirably expressed by Dr. Cos, who was its author. He\r\npaints in forcible language the misery created by the fifteen months\r\nof civil war, and the small reliance that Spain could place on creole\r\ntroops, whose sympathies, at present, and whose efforts, in the end,\r\nwould all be thrown into the scale of their country. He assumes as\r\nfundamental principles that America and Spain are naturally equal;\r\nthat America has as much right to her Cortes as Spain has to hers;\r\nthat the existing rulers in the Peninsula have no just authority over\r\nMexico as long as their sovereign is a captive, and, finally, he\r\nproposes that if \"the Europeans will consent to give up the offices\r\nthey hold, and allow the assemblage of a general congress, their\r\npersons and property shall be religiously respected, their salaries\r\npaid, and the same privileges granted them as to native Mexicans, who,\r\non their side, will acknowledge Ferdinand as the legitimate sovereign,\r\nand assist the Peninsula with their treasure, whilst they will at all\r\ntimes regard the Spaniards as fellow subjects of the same great empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe alternative of war was presented to the viceroy together with\r\nthese moderate demands, but he was only requested to abate the\r\npersonal cruelties that had hitherto been committed, and to save the\r\ntowns and villages from sacking or destruction by fire. Yet the insane\r\nVenegas would listen to no terms with the rebels, and caused the\r\nmanifesto to be burned in the great square, by the common executioner.\r\nThe principles of the document, however, had been spread abroad among\r\nthe people, and the flames of the hangman could no longer destroy the\r\nliberal doctrines which were deeply sown in the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished revolutionary chief Morelos, a clergyman, now\r\nappears prominently upon the stage. He had been commissioned by\r\nHidalgo as Captain General of the provinces on the south-west coast in\r\n1810, and departed for his government with as sorry an army as the\r\ntroop of Falstaff. His escort consisted of a few servants from his\r\ncuracy, armed with six muskets and some old lances. But he gathered\r\nforces as he advanced. The Galeanas joined him with their adherents\r\nand swelled his numbers to near a thousand. They advanced to Acapulco,\r\nand having captured it with abundant booty, the insurgents soon found\r\ntheir ranks joined by numerous important persons, and, among them the\r\n_Cura_ Matamoros and the Bravos, whose names have, ever since, been\r\nprominently connected with the history and development of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe year 1811 was passed in a series of petty engagements; but, in\r\nJanuary, 1812, the insurgents penetrated within twenty-five leagues of\r\nthe capital, where Galeana and Bravo took the town of Tasco.\r\n\r\nMorelos was victorious in several other actions in the same and\r\nsucceeding months, and pushed his advanced guards into the valley of\r\nMexico, where he occupied Chalco and San Agustin de las Cuevas, about\r\ntwelve miles from the metropolis. Morelos finally resolved to make his\r\nstand at Cuautla, in the _tierra caliente_, on the other side of the\r\nmountain ranges which hem in the valley; and, to this place the\r\nviceroy Venegas despatched Calleja, who was summoned from the north\r\nand west, where, as may readily be imagined, so fiery a spirit had not\r\nbeen idle or innocent since the defeat of Hidalgo.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1812, Calleja reached Zitacuaro, whence the\r\nalarmed Junta fled to Sultepec. The insatiate Spaniard took the town,\r\ndecimated the inhabitants, razed the walls to the ground, and burnt the\r\ndwellings, sparing only the churches and convents. After this dreadful\r\nrevenge upon a settlement which had committed no crime but in harboring\r\nthe Junta, he made a triumphal entrance into Mexico, and, on the 14th of\r\nFebruary, after a quarrel with the viceroy, and a solemn Te Deum, he\r\ndeparted towards Morelos, who was shut up in Cuautla de Amilpas.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th Calleja attacked the town, but was forced to retreat. He\r\nthen regularly besieged the place and its insurgent visitors for more\r\nthan two months and a half. In this period, the troops on both sides\r\nwere not unoccupied. Various skirmishes took place, but without signal\r\nresults of importance to either party. Morelos strove to prolong the\r\nsiege until the rainy season set in, when he felt confident that Calleja\r\nwould be forced to withdraw his troops, who could not endure the\r\ncombined heat and moisture of the _tierra caliente_ during the summer\r\nmonths. Calleja, on the other hand, supposed that by sealing the town\r\nhermetically, and cutting off all supplies, its inhabitants and troops\r\nwould soon be forced to surrender. Nor did he act unwisely for the\r\nsuccess of his master. Famine prevailed in the besieged garrison. Corn\r\nwas almost the only food. A cat sold for six dollars, a lizard for two,\r\nand rats and other vermin for one. But Morelos still continued firm,\r\nhoping by procrastination and endurance, to preserve the constancy of\r\nhis men until the month of June, when the country is generally deluged\r\nwith rain and rendered insalubrious to all who dwell habitually in\r\ncolder regions, or are unacclimated in the lower vallies and table lands\r\nof Mexico. His hopes, however, were not destined to be realized, for,\r\nupon consultation, it was found absolutely necessary to risk a general\r\nengagement or to abandon the town. The general engagement was considered\r\ninjudicious in the present condition of his troops, so that no\r\nalternative remained but that of retreat. This was safely effected on\r\nthe night of the 2d of May, 1812, notwithstanding the whole army of the\r\ninsurgents was obliged to pass between the enemy's batteries. After\r\nquitting the town, the forces were ordered to disperse, so as to avoid\r\nforming any concentrated point of attack for the pursuing Spaniards, and\r\nto reunite as soon as possible at Izucar, which was held by Don Miguel\r\nBravo. Calleja entered the abandoned town cautiously after the departure\r\nof the besieged, but the cruel revenge he took on the innocent\r\ninhabitants and harmless edifices, is indelibly imprinted in Mexican\r\nhistory as one of the darkest stains on the character of a soldier,\r\nwhose memory deserves the execration of civilized men.\r\n\r\nFrom Izucar, Morelos entered Tehuacan triumphantly, whence he passed\r\nto Orizaba where he captured artillery, vast quantities of tobacco,\r\nand a large amount of treasure. But he was not allowed to rest long in\r\npeace. The regular forces pursued his partizan warriors; and we next\r\nhear of him at Oaxaca, where he took possession of the town after a\r\nbrief resistance. It was at this place that Guadalupe Victoria,\r\nafterwards president of the republic, performed a feat which merits\r\nspecial remembrance as an act of extraordinary heroism and daring in\r\nthe face of an enemy. The town was moated and the single drawbridge\r\nsuspended, so as to cut off the approach of the insurgents. There were\r\nno boats to cross the stagnant water; and the insurgents, as they\r\napproached, were dismayed by the difficulty of reaching a town which\r\nseemed almost in their grasp. At this moment Guadalupe Victoria,\r\nsprang into the moat, swam across the strait in sight of the soldiers\r\nin the town who seem to have been panic struck by his signal courage,\r\nand cut the ropes that suspended the drawbridge, which, immediately\r\nfalling over the moat, allowed the soldiers of Morelos a free entrance\r\ninto the city!\r\n\r\nHere he rested for some time undisturbed by the Spaniards. He\r\nconquered the whole of the province with the exception of Acapulco, to\r\nwhich he laid siege in February, 1813, but it did not lower its flag\r\nuntil the following August. The control of a whole province, and the\r\nvictories of Bravo and Matamoros, elsewhere in 1812 and 1813,\r\nconsiderably increased the importance and influence of Morelos, who\r\nnow devoted himself to the assemblage of a national Congress at\r\nChilpanzingo composed of the original Junta of Zitacuaro, the deputies\r\nelected by the province of Oaxaca, and others selected by them as\r\nrepresentatives of the provinces which were in the royalists' hands.\r\nOn the 13th of November, 1813, this body published a declaration of\r\nthe absolute independence of Mexico.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\nDON FELIX MARIA CALLEJA, LX. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.--1813-1816.\r\n\r\nThis was the period at which the star of the great leader, Morelos,\r\nculminated. Bravo was still occasionally successful, and the\r\ncommander-in-chief, concentrating his forces at Chilpanzingo, prepared\r\nan expedition against the province of Valladolid. He departed on the\r\n8th of November, 1813; and, marching across a hitherto untraversed\r\ncountry of a hundred leagues, he reached this point about Christmas.\r\nBut here he found a large force under Llano and COLONEL ITURBIDE,--who\r\nwas still a loyalist--drawn up to encounter him. He attacked the enemy\r\nrashly with his jaded troops, and on the following day, was routed,\r\nwith the loss of his best regiments and all his artillery.\r\n\r\nAt Puruaran, Iturbide again assailed Morelos successfully, and\r\nMatamoros was taken prisoner. Efforts were made to save the life of\r\nthis eminent soldier, yet Calleja, who had succeeded Venegas as\r\nviceroy was too cruelly ungenerous to spare so daring a rebel. He was\r\nshot, and his death was avenged by the slaughter of all the prisoners\r\nwho were in the hands of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nFor a while Morelos struggled bravely against adversity, his\r\ncharacter and resources rising with every new danger, difficulty or\r\nloss. But the die was cast. Oaxaca was recaptured by the royalists on\r\nthe 28th of March, 1814. Miguel Bravo died at Puebla on the scaffold;\r\nGaleana fell in battle; and the Congress was driven from Chilpanzingo\r\nto the forest of Apatzingo, where, on the 22d of October, 1814, it\r\nenacted the constitution which bears the name of its wild birth-place.\r\n\r\nFrom this temporary refuge the insurgents resolved to cross the\r\ncountry by rapid marches to Tehuacan in the province of Puebla, where\r\nMier y Teran had gathered a considerable force, which Morelos imagined\r\nwould become the nucleus of an overwhelming army, as soon as he joined\r\nthem. But his hopes were not destined to be realized. He had advanced\r\nas far as Tesmaluca, when the Indians of the village betrayed his\r\nslender forces to General Concha, who fell upon them, on the 5th of\r\nNovember, 1815, in the narrow gorge of a mountain road. The assault\r\nwas from the rear; so that Morelos, ordering Nocalas Bravo to hasten\r\nhis march with the main body of the army as an escort for the\r\nill-starred congress, resolved to fight the royalists until he placed\r\nthe national legislature out of danger. \"My life\"--said he--\"is of\r\nlittle consequence, provided congress be saved:--my race was run when\r\nI saw an independent government established!\"\r\n\r\nThe brave soldier-priest, with fifty men, maintained the pass against\r\nConcha, until only one trooper was left beside him. So furious was his\r\npersonal bearing, during this mortal conflict, that the royalists\r\nfeared to advance until he was bereft of all support. When finally\r\ncaptured, he was stripped, chained, treated with the most shameless\r\ncruelty, and carried back to Tesmaluca. Concha, however, was less\r\ncruel than his men. He received the rebel chief politely, and\r\ndespatched him to the capital for trial. Crowds of eager citizens\r\nflocked to see the celebrated partizan warrior who had so long held\r\nthe Spanish forces at bay. But his doom was sealed; and, on the 22d of\r\nDecember, 1815, Concha removed him to the hospital of San Cristoval.\r\nAfter dining with the general, and thanking him for his kindness, he\r\nwalked to the rear of the building, where, kneeling down, he bound a\r\nhandkerchief over his eyes and uttering the simple ejaculation, \"Lord,\r\nif I have done well, thou knowest it;--if ill, to thy infinite mercy I\r\ncommend my soul,\"--he gave the fatal signal to the soldiers who were\r\ndrawn up to shoot him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: We must mention an event, characteristic of Bravo, which\r\noccurred during this period. Bravo took Palmar, by storm, after a\r\nresistance of three days. Three hundred prisoners fell into his hands,\r\nwho were placed at his disposal by Morelos. Bravo immediately offered\r\nthem to the viceroy Venegas in exchange for _his father_, Don Leonardo\r\nBravo, who had been sentenced to death in the capital. The offer was\r\nrejected, and Don Leonardo ordered to immediate execution. But the son\r\nat once commanded the prisoners to be liberated,--saying that he\r\n\"wished to put it out of his power to avenge his parent's death, lest,\r\nin the first moments of grief the temptation should prove\r\nirresistible.\"--Ward, 1 vol. 204.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1816-1821.\r\n\r\n    APODACA VICEROY.--SPANISH CONSTITUTION OF 1812 PROCLAIMED IN\r\n    MEXICO.--CONDITION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY.--VICTORIA--MINA\r\n    LANDS AT SOTO LA MARINA--HIS EFFORTS--LOS REMEDIOS--GUERILLAS--HE\r\n    IS SHOT.--PADRE TORRES--ITURBIDE--APODOCA SELECTS HIM TO ESTABLISH\r\n    ABSOLUTISM.--ITURBIDE PROMULGATES THE PLAN OF IGUA LA--ARMY OF THE\r\n    THREE GUARANTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN RUIZ DE APODACA, CONDE DEL VENADITO, LXI. VICEROY OF NEW\r\nSPAIN. 1816-1821.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Morelos the hopes of the insurgents were crushed and\r\ntheir efforts paralyzed. This extraordinary man, so fertile in\r\nresources, and blending in himself the mingled power of priest and\r\ngeneral, had secured the confidence of the masses, who found among his\r\nofficers, none upon whom they could rally with perfect reliance.\r\nBesides this, the congress which had been conducted safely to Tehuacan\r\nby Bravo, was summarily dissolved by General Teran, who considered it\r\nan \"inconvenient appendage of a camp.\" We cannot but regard this act\r\nof the general as unwise at a moment, when the insurgents lost such a\r\ncommander as Morelos. By the dissolution of the congress the nation\r\nabandoned another point of reunion; and from that moment, the cause\r\nbegan to fail in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe CONSTITUTION, sanctioned by the Cortes in 1812, had, meanwhile,\r\nbeen proclaimed in Mexico, on the 29th of September of that year; and,\r\nwhilst the people felt somewhat freer under it, they were enabled, by\r\nthe liberty of the press, which lasted sixty-six days, to expend their\r\nnew-born patriotism on paper instead of in battles. These popular\r\nexcitements, served to sustain the spirits of the people,\r\nnotwithstanding the losses of the army; so that when Apodaca, assumed\r\nthe reins of the viceroyalty in 1816, the country was still republican\r\nat heart, though all the insurgent generals were either captured or\r\nhidden in the wilderness, whilst their disbanded forces, in most\r\ninstances, had accepted the _indulto_, or pardon, proffered for their\r\nreturn to allegiance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe remaining officers of Morelos spread themselves over the country,\r\nas there was no longer any centre of action; and each of them,\r\noccupying a different district, managed, for a while, to support\r\nrevolutionary fervor throughout the neighborhood. \"Guerrero occupied\r\nthe west coast, where he maintained himself until the year 1821, when\r\nhe joined Iturbide. Rayon commanded in the vicinity of Tlalpujahua,\r\nwhere he successively maintained two fortified camps on the Cerro del\r\nGallo, and on Coporo. Teran held the district of Tehuacan, in Puebla.\r\nBravo was a wanderer throughout the country. The Bajio was tyrannized\r\nover by the Padre Torres, while Guadalupe Victoria occupied the\r\nimportant province of Vera Cruz.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThe chief spite of the royalists,--who hunted these republican heroes,\r\namong the forests and mountain fastnesses of Mexico, as the\r\nCovenanters had been hunted in Scotland,--seems to have fallen upon\r\nthe last named of these patriot generals. Victoria's haunt was chiefly\r\nin the passes near the Puente del Rey, now the Puente Nacional, or\r\nNational bridge, on the road leading from the port of Vera Cruz to the\r\ncapital. He was prepared to act either with a large force of\r\n_guerillas_, or, with a simple body guard; and, knowing the country\r\nperfectly, he was enabled to descend from his fastnesses among the\r\nrocks, and thus to cut off, almost entirely, all communication between\r\nthe coast and the metropolis. At length, superior forces were sent to\r\npursue him with relentless fury. His men gradually deserted when the\r\nvillages that formerly supplied them with food refused further\r\ncontributions. Efforts were made to seduce him from his principles and\r\nto ensure his loyalty. But he refused the rank and rewards offered by\r\nthe viceroy as the price of his submission. At length he found himself\r\nalone in his resistance, in the midst of countrymen, who, if they\r\nwould no longer fight under his banner, were too faithful to betray\r\nhim. Yet he would not abandon the cause, but, taking his sword and a\r\nsmall stock of raiment, departed for the mountains, where he wandered\r\nfor thirty months, living on the fruits of the forest and gnawing the\r\nbones of dead animals found in their recesses. Nor did he emerge from\r\nthis impenetrable concealment, until two faithful Indians, whom he had\r\nknown in prosperous days, sought him out with great difficulty, and,\r\ncommunicating the joyous intelligence of the revolution of 1821,\r\nbrought him back once more to their villages where he was received\r\nwith enthusiastic reverence as a patriot raised from the dead. When\r\ndiscovered by the Indians he was worn to a skeleton, covered with\r\nhair, and clad in a tattered wrapper; but, amid all his distresses and\r\nlosses, he had preserved and treasured his loyalty to the cause of\r\nliberty and his untarnished sword!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another actor in this revolutionary army had appeared upon\r\nthe stage. This was XAVIER MINA, a _guerilla_ chief of old Spain, who\r\nfled from his country, in consequence of the unfortunate effort to\r\norganize an outbreak in favor of the Cortes, at Pampeluna, after the\r\ndissolution of that assembly by the king. He landed on the coast of\r\nMexico at Soto la Marina with a brave band of foreigners, chiefly\r\nNorth Americans, on the 15th of April, 1817. His forces amounted to\r\nonly three hundred and fifty-nine men, including officers, of whom\r\nfifty-one deserted before he marched into the interior. Leaving one\r\nhundred of these soldiers at Soto la Marina under the command of Major\r\nSarda, he attempted with the remainder, to join the independents in\r\nthe heart of the country.\r\n\r\nMina pressed onwards successfully, defeating several royalist parties,\r\nuntil he reached Sombrero, whence he sallied forth upon numerous\r\nexpeditions, one of which was against the fortified _hacienda_ or\r\nplantation of the Marques of Jaral, a creole nobleman, from which the\r\ninhabitants and the owner fled at his approach. His troops sacked this\r\nwealthy establishment, and Mina transferred to the public chest one\r\nhundred and forty thousand dollars, found concealed in the house. This\r\nnobleman, it is true, had given in his adhesion to the royal cause and\r\nfortified his dwelling against the insurgents who hitherto refrained\r\nfrom attacking him. Nevertheless, the unprovoked blow of an\r\nindependent leader against a native of the country, and especially\r\nagainst a man whose extensive farming operations concentrated the\r\ninterests of so large a laboring class, was not calculated to inspire\r\nconfidence in Mina among the masses of the people.\r\n\r\nWhilst the guerilla chief was thus pursuing his way successfully in\r\nthe heart of the country, and receiving occasional reinforcements from\r\nthe natives, the garrison he left at Soto la Marina fell into the\r\nhands of Spanish levies, two thousand of whom surrounded the slender\r\nband. Notwithstanding the inequality of forces between the assailants\r\nand the besieged, the royalists were unable to take the place by\r\nstorm; but, after repeated repulses, General Arredondo proposed terms\r\nwhich were accepted by Major Sarda, the independent commander. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to say that this condition was not fulfilled by the\r\nSpaniards, who sent the capitulated garrison in irons, by a circuitous\r\njourney, to the sickly Castle of San Juan de Ulua at Vera Cruz, whence\r\nsome of the unfortunate wretches were marched into the interior whilst\r\nothers were despatched across the sea to the dungeons of Cadiz,\r\nMelilla and Ceuta. This was a severe blow to Mina, who nevertheless\r\nwas unparalyzed by it but continued active in the vicinity of Sombrero\r\nto which he retreated after an illjudged attempt upon the town of\r\nLeon, where the number of his troops was considerably diminished.\r\nSombrero was invested, soon after, by a force of three thousand five\r\nhundred and forty soldiers, under Don Pascual Liñan, who had been\r\nappointed Field Marshal, by Apodaca, and despatched to the Bajio. This\r\nsiege was ultimately successful on the part of the royalists. The\r\nfresh supplies promised to Mina did not arrive. Colonel Young, his\r\nsecond in command, died in repulsing an assault; and, upon the\r\ngarrison's attempting to evacuate the town, under Colonel Bradburn, on\r\nthe night of the 19th of August, the enemy fell upon the independents\r\nwith such vigor that but fifty of Mina's whole corps escaped. \"No\r\nquarter,\" says Ward, \"was given in the field, and the unfortunate\r\nwretches who had been left in the hospital wounded, were by Liñan's\r\norders, carried or dragged along the ground from their beds to the\r\nsquare where they were stripped and shot!\"\r\n\r\nMina, as a last resort, threw himself into the fort of Los Remedios, a\r\nnatural fortification on the lofty mountain chain rising out of the\r\nplains of the Bajio between Silao and Penjamo, separated from the rest\r\nby precipices, and deep ravines.\r\n\r\nLiñan's army sat down before Remedios on the 27th of August. Mina left\r\nthe town so as to assail the army from without by his _guerillas_,\r\nwhilst the garrison kept the main body engaged with the fort. During\r\nthis period he formed the project of attacking the town of Guanajuato,\r\nwhich, in fact, he accomplished; yet, after his troops had penetrated\r\nthe heart of the city, their courage failed and they retreated before\r\nthe loyalists who rallied after the panic created by the unexpected\r\nassault at nightfall. On retreating from Guanajuato, our partizan\r\nwarrior took the road to the Rancho del Venadito where he designed\r\npassing the night in order to consult upon his future plans with his\r\nfriend Mariano Herrera. Here he was detected by a friar, who apprised\r\nOrrantia of the brave Mina's presence, and, on the morning of the 27th\r\nof October, he was seized and conveyed to Irapuato. On the 11th of\r\nNovember, 1817, in the 28th year of his age, he was shot by order of\r\nApodaca, on a rock, in sight of Los Remedios.\r\n\r\nAt the end of December the ammunition of the insurgents in this\r\nstronghold was entirely exhausted, and its evacuation was resolved on.\r\nThis was attempted on the 1st of January, 1818, but, with the\r\nexception of Padre Torres, the commander, and twelve of Mina's\r\ndivision, few or none of the daring fugitives escaped. The wretched\r\ninmates of the fort, the women, and garrison hospitals of wounded,\r\nwere cut down, bayoneted, and burned. On the 6th of March, the fort of\r\nJauxilla, the insurgents' last stronghold in the central parts of the\r\ncountry, fell, while, towards the middle of the year, all the\r\nrevolutionary chiefs were dislodged and without commands, except\r\nGuerrero, who still maintained himself on the right bank of the river\r\nZacatula, near Colima, on the Pacific. But even he was cut off from\r\ncommunication with the interior, and was altogether without hope of\r\nassistance from without. The heart of the nation, and the east\r\ncoast,--which was of most importance so far as the reception of\r\nauxiliaries by the independents was concerned,--were, thus, in\r\ncomplete possession of the royalists; so that a viceroy declared in\r\nhis despatches to Spain, \"that he would be answerable for the safety\r\nof Mexico without a single additional soldier being sent out to\r\nreinforce the armies that were in the field.\"\r\n\r\nBut the viceroy Apodaca, confident as he was of the defeat of the\r\ninsurrection, did not know the people with whom he dealt as well as\r\nhis predecessor Calleja,[62] who, with all his cruelty, seems to have\r\nenjoyed sagacious intervals in which he comprehended perfectly the\r\ndeep seated causes of revolutionary feeling in Mexico, even if he was\r\nindisposed to sympathize with them or to permit their manifestation by\r\nthe people. In fact, the revolution was not quelled. It slept, for\r\nwant of a leader;--but, at last he appeared in the person of AGUSTIN\r\nDE ITURBIDE, a native Mexican, whose military career, in the loyalist\r\ncause had been not only brilliant but eminently useful, for it was in\r\nconsequence of the two severe blows inflicted by him upon the\r\ninsurgents in the actions of Valladolid and Puruaran that the great\r\narmy of Morelos was routed and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Apodaca, who was no friend of the constitution, and who\r\nsuffered a diminution of power by its operation, was well disposed to\r\nput it down by force, and to proclaim once more the absolute authority\r\nof the king. The elective privileges, which the constitution secured\r\nto the people, together with the principles of freedom which those\r\nelections were calculated to foster among the masses, were considered\r\nby the viceroy as dangerous in a country so recently the theatre of\r\nrevolution. The insurrection was regarded by him as ended forever. He\r\ndespised, perhaps, the few distinguished persons who yet quietly\r\nmanifested their preference for liberalism; and, like all men of\r\ndespotic character and confident of power, he undervalued the popular\r\nmasses, among whom there is ever to be found common sense, true\r\nappreciation of natural rights, and firmness to vindicate them\r\nwhenever they are confident of the leaders who are to control their\r\ndestiny when embarked upon the stormy sea of rebellion.\r\n\r\nApodaca, in pursuit of his project to restore absolutism on this\r\ncontinent, fixed his eyes upon the gallant ITURBIDE, whose polished\r\nmanners, captivating address, elegant person, ambitious spirit, and\r\nrenowned military services, signalized him as a person likely to play\r\na distinguished part in the restoration of a supreme power whose first\r\nfavors would probably be showered upon the successful soldier of a\r\ncrusade against constitutional freedom.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the viceroy offered Iturbide the command of a force upon\r\nthe west coast, at the head of which he was to proclaim the\r\nre-establishment of the king's _absolute_ authority. The command was\r\naccepted; but Iturbide, who had been for four years unemployed, had,\r\nin this interval of repose, reflected well upon the condition of\r\nMexico, and was satisfied that if the creoles could be induced to\r\nco-operate with the independents, the Spanish yoke might be cast off.\r\nThere were only eleven Spanish expeditionary regiments in the whole of\r\nMexico, and although there were upwards of seventy thousand old\r\nSpaniards in the different provinces who supported these soldiers,\r\nthey could not oppose, effectually, the seven veteran and seventeen\r\nprovincial regiments of natives, aided by the masses of people who had\r\nsignified their attachment to liberalism.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of allying himself with the cause of a falling\r\nmonarchy, whose reliance must chiefly be confined to succors from\r\nacross the ocean, Iturbide resolved to abandon the viceroy and his\r\ncriminal project against the constitution, and to throw himself with\r\nhis forces upon the popular cause of the country. It was a bold but\r\nsuccessful move.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1821, he was at the small town of Iguala, on\r\nthe road to Acapulco; and on that day, at his headquarters, he\r\nproclaimed the celebrated PLAN OF IGUALA, the several principles of\r\nwhich are:--\"Independence, the maintenance of Roman Catholicity, and\r\nUnion;\"--whence his forces obtained the name of the \"Army of the three\r\nGuaranties.\"\r\n\r\nAs this is probably one of the most important state papers in the\r\nhistory of Mexico, and is often referred to without being fully\r\nunderstood, we shall present it to the reader entire:\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF IGUALA.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1.--The Mexican nation is independent of the Spanish nation,\r\nand of every other, even on its own continent.\r\n\r\nART. 2.--Its religion shall be the Catholic, which all its inhabitants\r\nprofess.\r\n\r\nART. 3.--They shall all be united, without any distinction between\r\nAmericans and Europeans.\r\n\r\nART. 4.--The government shall be a constitutional monarchy.\r\n\r\nART. 5.--A Junta shall be named, consisting of individuals who enjoy\r\nthe highest reputation in different parties which have shown themselves.\r\n\r\nART. 6.--This Junta shall be under the presidency of his excellency\r\nthe Conde del Venadito, the present viceroy of Mexico.\r\n\r\nART. 7.--It shall govern in the name of the nation, according to the\r\nlaws now in force, and its principal business will be to convoke,\r\naccording to such rules as it shall deem expedient, a congress for the\r\nformation of a constitution more suitable to the country.\r\n\r\nART. 8.--His Majesty Ferdinand VII. shall be invited to the throne of\r\nthe empire, and in case of his refusal, the Infantes Don Carlos and\r\nDon Francisco De Paula.\r\n\r\nART. 9.--Should his Majesty Ferdinand VII. and his august brothers,\r\ndecline the invitation, the nation is at liberty to invite to the\r\nimperial throne any member of reigning families whom it may choose to\r\nselect.\r\n\r\nART. 10.--The formation of the constitution by the congress, and the\r\noath of the emperor to observe it, must precede his entry into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nART. 11.--The distinction of castes is abolished, which was made by\r\nthe Spanish law, excluding them from the rights of citizenship. All\r\nthe inhabitants are citizens, and equal, and the door of advancement\r\nis open to virtue and merit.\r\n\r\nART. 12.--An army shall be formed for the support of religion,\r\nindependence, and union, guaranteeing these three principles, and\r\ntherefore shall be called the army of the three guaranties.\r\n\r\nART. 13.--It shall solemnly swear to defend the fundamental basis of\r\nthis plan.\r\n\r\nART. 14.--It shall strictly observe the military ordinances now in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nART. 15.--There shall be no other promotions than those which are due\r\nto seniority, or which are necessary for the good of the service.\r\n\r\nART. 16.--The army shall be considered as of the line.\r\n\r\nART. 17.--The old partizans of independence who shall adhere to this\r\nplan, shall be considered as individuals of this army.\r\n\r\nART. 18.--The patriots and peasants who shall adhere to it hereafter,\r\nshall be considered as provincial militiamen.\r\n\r\nART. 19.--The secular and regular priests shall be continued in the\r\nstate which they now are.\r\n\r\nART. 20.--All the public functionaries, civil, ecclesiastical,\r\npolitical and military, who adhere to the cause of independence, shall\r\nbe continued in their offices, without any distinction between\r\nAmericans and Europeans.\r\n\r\nART. 21.--Those functionaries, of whatever degree and condition who\r\ndissent from the cause of independence, shall be divested of their\r\noffices, and shall quit the territory without taking with them their\r\nfamilies and effects.\r\n\r\nART. 22.--The military commandants shall regulate themselves according\r\nto the general instructions in conformity with this plan, which shall\r\nbe transmitted to them.\r\n\r\nART. 23.--No accused person shall be condemned capitally by the\r\nmilitary commandants. Those accused of treason against the nation,\r\nwhich is the next greatest crime after that of treason to the Divine\r\nRuler, shall be conveyed to the fortress of Barbaras, where they shall\r\nremain until congress shall resolve on the punishment that ought to be\r\ninflicted on them.\r\n\r\nART. 24.--It being indispensable to the country, that this plan should\r\nbe carried into effect, inasmuch as the welfare of that country is its\r\nobject, every individual of the army shall maintain it, to the\r\nshedding (if it be necessary) of the last drop of his blood.\r\n\r\nTown of Iguala, 24th February, 1821.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Ward vol. i, 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: See Calleja's confidential letter to the Spanish\r\nminister of war, with a private report on the Mexican Revolution.\r\nWard, vol. i, p. 509--Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1821-1824.\r\n\r\n    O'DONOJU VICEROY.--CONDUCT OF ITURBIDE--NOVELLA.--REVOLT--TREATY\r\n    OF CORDOVA.--FIRST MEXICAN CORTES--ITURBIDE EMPEROR--HIS\r\n    CAREER--EXILED TO ITALY.--ITURBIDE RETURNS--ARREST--EXECUTION--HIS\r\n    CHARACTER AND SERVICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nO'DONOJU, LXII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN, ITURBIDE, EMPEROR OF\r\nMEXICO.--1821-1824.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the Plan of Iguala, that Mexico was designed to\r\nbecome an independent sovereignty under Ferdinand VII. or, in the\r\nevent of his refusal, under the Infantes Don Carlos and Don Francisco\r\nde Paula. Iturbide was still a royalist--not a republican; and it is\r\nvery doubtful whether he would ever have assented to popular\r\nauthority, even had his life been spared to witness the final\r\ndevelopment of the revolution. It is probable that his penetrating\r\nmind distinguished between popular hatred of unjust restraint, and the\r\ngenuine capacity of a nation for liberty, nor is it unlikely that he\r\nfound among his countrymen but few of those self-controlling,\r\nself-sacrificing and progressive elements, which constitute the only\r\nfoundation upon which a republic can be securely founded. His ambition\r\nhad not yet been fully developed by success, and it cannot be imagined\r\nthat he had already fixed his heart upon the imperial throne.\r\n\r\nWhen the Plan of Iguala was proclaimed, the entire army of the future\r\nemperor, consisted of only eight hundred men, all of whom took the\r\noath of fidelity to the project, though many deserted when they found\r\nthe country was not immediately unanimous in its approval.\r\n\r\nIn the capital, the viceroy appears to have been paralyzed by the sudden\r\nand unexpected movement of his officer. He paused, hesitated, failed to\r\nact, and was deposed by the Europeans, who treated him as they had\r\nIturrigaray in 1808. Don Francisco de Novella, an artillery officer, was\r\ninstalled temporarily in his stead, but the appointment created a\r\ndissension among the people in the capital and the country, and this so\r\ncompletely prostrated the action of the central authorities, who might\r\nhave crushed the revolution by a blow, that Iturbide was enabled to\r\nprosecute his designs throughout the most important parts of the\r\ninterior of the country, without the slightest resistance.\r\n\r\nHe seized a million of dollars on their way to the west coast, and\r\njoined Guerrero who still held out on the river Zacatula with the last\r\nremnant of the old revolutionary forces. Guerrero gave in his adhesion\r\nto Iturbide, as soon as he ascertained that it was the general's\r\ndesign to make Mexico _independent_, though, in all likelihood, he\r\ndisapproved the other features of the plan. Guerrero's act was of the\r\ngreatest national importance. It rallied all the veteran fighters and\r\nfriends of Morelos and the Bravos. Almost all of the former leaders\r\nand their dispersed bands, came forth, at the cry of \"independence,\"\r\nunder the banner of Iturbide. Victoria even, for a while, befriended\r\nthe rising hero; but he had fought for a liberal government, and did\r\nnot long continue on amicable terms with one who could not control his\r\ntruly independent spirit. The clergy, as well as the people, signified\r\ntheir intention to support the gallant insurgent;--and, in fact, the\r\nwhole country, from Vera Cruz to Acapulco, with the exception of the\r\ncapital, was soon open in its adhesion to him and his army.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN O'DONOJU, LXII. VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN.--1821.\r\n\r\nIturbide was now in full authority, and whilst preparing to march on the\r\ncity of Mexico, in which the viceroy, _ad interim_, was shut up, he\r\nlearned that Don Juan O'Donoju had arrived at San Juan de Ulua to fill\r\nthe place of Apodaca as viceroy. Proposals were immediately sent by the\r\ngeneral to this new functionary, and in an interview with him at\r\nCordova, Iturbide proposed the adoption of the Plan of Iguala _by\r\ntreaty_, as the only project by which the Spaniards in Mexico could be\r\nsaved from the fury of the people, and the sovereignty of the colony\r\npreserved for Ferdinand. We shall not pause to enquire whether the\r\nviceroy was justified or even empowered, to compromise the rights of\r\nSpain by such a compact. O'Donoju, though under the safeguard of a\r\ntruce, was in truth a helpless man as soon as he touched the soil of\r\nMexico, for no portions of it were actually under the Spanish authority\r\nexcept the castle of San Juan de Ulua and the capital, whose garrisons\r\nwere chiefly composed of European levies. Humanity, perhaps, ultimately\r\ncontrolled his decision, and in the name of his master, he recognised\r\nthe independence of Mexico and yielded the metropolis to the \"army of\r\nthe three Guaranties,\" which entered it peacefully on the 27th of\r\nSeptember, 1821. A provisional Junta of thirty-six persons immediately\r\nelected a regency of five, of which Iturbide was president, and, at the\r\nsame time, he was created Generalissimo, Lord High Admiral, and assigned\r\na yearly stipend of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1822, the first Mexican Congress or Cortes,\r\nmet; but it contained within it the germ of all the future\r\ndiscontents, which since that day, have harassed and nearly ruined\r\nMexico. Scarcely had this body met when three parties manifested their\r\nbitter animosities and personal ambitions. The Bourbonists adhered,\r\nloyally, to the Plan of Iguala, a constitutional monarchy and the\r\nsovereignty of Ferdinand. The Republicans, discarded the plan as a\r\ndevice that had served its day, and insisted upon a central or federal\r\nrepublic; and, last of all, the partisans of the successful soldier,\r\nstill clung to all of the plan save the clause which gave the throne\r\nto a Bourbon prince, for, at heart, they desired to place Iturbide\r\nhimself upon it, and thus to cut off their country forever from all\r\nconnection with Europe.\r\n\r\nAs soon as O'Donoju's treaty of Cordova reached Spain, it was\r\nnullified by the Cortes, and the Bourbon party in Mexico, of course\r\nfell with it. The Republicans and Iturbidists, alone remained on the\r\nfield to contend for the prize, and after congress had disgraced\r\nitself by incessant bickerings over the army and the public funds, a\r\ncertain Pio Marcha, first sergeant of the first regiment of infantry\r\ngathered a band of _leperos_ before the palace of Iturbide on the\r\nnight of the 18th of May, 1822, and proclaimed him Emperor, with the\r\ntitle of AGUSTIN THE FIRST. A show of resistance was made by Iturbide\r\nagainst the proffered crown; but it is likely that it was in reality,\r\nas faint as his joy was unbounded at the sudden elevation from a\r\nbarrack room to the imperial palace. Congress, of course, approved the\r\ndecision of the mob and army. The provinces sanctioned the acts of\r\ntheir representatives, and Iturbide ascended the throne.\r\n\r\nBut his reign was brief. Rapid success, love of power, impatience of\r\nrestraint,--all of which are characteristic of the Spanish\r\nsoldier,--made him strain the bonds of constitutional right. His\r\nstruggles for control were incessant. \"He demanded,\" says Ward, \"a\r\nveto upon all articles of the constitution then under discussion, and\r\nthe right of appointing and removing, at pleasure, the members of the\r\nsupreme tribunal of justice. He recommended also the establishment of\r\na military tribunal in the capital, with powers but little inferior to\r\nthose exercised by the Spanish commandants during the revolution; and\r\nwhen these proposals were firmly rejected, he arrested, on the night\r\nof the 26th August, 1822, fourteen of the deputies who had advocated,\r\nduring the discussion, principles but little in unison with the views\r\nof the government.\"\r\n\r\nThis high handed measure, and the openly manifested displeasure of\r\ncongress, produced so complete a rupture between the emperor and the\r\npopular representatives, that it was impossible to conduct public\r\naffairs with any concert of action. Accordingly, Iturbide dissolved\r\nthe assembly, and on the 30th of October, 1822, created an Instituent\r\nJunta of forty-five persons selected by himself from amongst the most\r\npliant members of the recent congress. This irregularly formed body\r\nwas intolerable to the people, while the expelled deputies, who\r\nreturned to their respective districts, soon spread the spirit of\r\ndiscontent and proclaimed the American usurper to be as dangerous as\r\nthe European despot.\r\n\r\nIn November, General Garza headed a revolt in the northern provinces.\r\nSANTA ANNA, then governor of Vera Cruz, declared against the emperor.\r\nGeneral Echavari, sent by Iturbide to crush the future president of\r\nMexico, resolved not to stem the torrent of public opinion, and joined\r\nthe general he had been commissioned to capture. Guadalupe\r\nVictoria,--driven to his fastnesses by the emperor, who was unable to\r\nwin the incorruptible patriot, descended once more from the mountain\r\nforests, where he had been concealed, and joined the battalions of\r\nSanta Anna. And, on the 1st of February, 1823, a convention, called\r\nthe \"Act of Casa-Mata,\" was signed, by which the re-establishment of\r\nthe National Representative Assembly was pledged.\r\n\r\nThe country was soon in arms. The Marques Vibanco, Generals Guerrero,\r\nBravo, and Negrete, in various sections of the nation, proclaimed\r\ntheir adhesion to the popular movement; and on the 8th of March, 1823,\r\nIturbide, finding that the day was lost, offered his abdication to\r\nsuch members of the old congress as he was able to assemble hastily in\r\nthe metropolis. The abdication was, however, twice refused on the\r\nground that congress, by accepting it, would necessarily sanction the\r\nlegality of his right to wear the crown; nevertheless, that body\r\npermitted his departure from Mexico, after endowing him liberally with\r\nan income of twenty-five thousand dollars a year, besides providing a\r\nvessel to bear him and his family to Leghorn in Italy.\r\n\r\nVictoria, Bravo, and Negrete entered the capital on the 27th of\r\nMarch, and were chosen by the old congress which quickly reassembled,\r\nas a triumvirate to exercise supreme executive powers until the new\r\ncongress assembled in the following August. In October, 1824, this\r\nbody finally sanctioned the federal constitution, which, after various\r\nrevolutions, overthrows, and reforms, was readopted in the year 1847.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, 1824, a vessel under British colors was perceived\r\non the Mexican coast near the mouth of the Santander. On the next day,\r\na Polish gentlemen came on shore from the ship, and, announcing\r\nhimself as Charles de Beneski, visited General Felix la Garza,\r\ncommandant of the district of Soto la Marina. He professed to visit\r\nthat remote district, with a friend, for the purpose of purchasing\r\nland from the government on which they designed establishing a colony.\r\nGarza gave them leave to enter the country for this purpose; but\r\nsuspicions were soon aroused against the singular visitors and they\r\nwere arrested. As soon as the friend of the Pole was stripped of his\r\ndisguise, the Emperor Iturbide stood in front of Garza, whom he had\r\ndisgraced for his participation in the revolt during his brief reign.\r\n\r\nLa Garza immediately secured the prisoner, and sent him to Padilla,\r\nwhere he delivered him to the authorities of Tamaulipas. The state\r\nlegislature being in session, promptly resolved, in the excess of\r\npatriotic zeal, to execute a decree of the congress, passed in the\r\npreceding April, by condemning the royal exile to death. Short time\r\nwas given Iturbide to arrange his affairs. He was allowed no appeal to\r\nthe general government. He confessed to a priest on the evening of the\r\n19th of July, and was led to the place of execution, where he fell,\r\npierced with four balls, two of which took effect in his brain and two\r\nin his heart!\r\n\r\nThus perished the hero who, suddenly, unexpectedly, and effectually,\r\ncrushed the power of Spain in North America. It is not fair to judge him\r\nby the standards that are generally applied to the life of a\r\ndistinguished civilian, or even of a successful soldier, in countries\r\nwhere the habits and education of the people fit them for duties\r\nrequiring forbearance, patience, or high intellectual culture. Iturbide\r\nwas, according to all reliable accounts, a refined gentleman, yet he was\r\ntyrannical and sometimes cruel, for it is recorded in his own\r\nhandwriting, that on Good Friday, 1814, \"in honor of the day, he had\r\njust ordered three hundred excommunicated wretches to be shot!\" His\r\nearly life was passed in the saddle and the barrack room; nor had he\r\nmuch leisure to pursue the studies of a statesman, even if his mind had\r\nbeen capable of resolving all their mysteries. His temper was not\r\ncalculated for the liberal debates of a free senate. He was better\r\nfitted to discipline an army than to guide a nation. Educated in a\r\nschool in which subordination is a necessity, and where unquestioning\r\nobedience is exacted, he was unable to appreciate the rights of\r\ndeliberative assemblies. He felt, perhaps, that, in the disorganized\r\ncondition of his country, it was needful to control the people by force\r\nin order to save the remnant of civilization from complete anarchy. But\r\nhe wanted conciliatory manners to seduce the congress into obedience to\r\nhis behests,--and he therefore unfortunately and unwisely played the\r\nmilitary despot when he should have acted the part of a quiet\r\ndiplomatist. Finding himself, in two years, emperor of Mexico, after\r\nbeing, at the commencement of that period, nothing more than commander\r\nof a regiment, it may be pardoned if he was bewildered by the rapidity\r\nof his rise, and if the air he breathed in his extraordinary ascent was\r\ntoo etherial for a man of so excitable a temperament.\r\n\r\nIn every aspect of his character, we must regard him as one altogether\r\ninadequate to shape the destiny of a nation emerging from the blood\r\nand smoke of two revolutions,--a nation whose political tendencies\r\ntowards absolute freedom, were at that time, naturally, the positive\r\nreverse of his own.\r\n\r\nDeath sealed the lips of men who might have clamored for him in the\r\ncourse of a few years, when the insubordinate spirit that was soon\r\nmanifested needed as bold an arm as that of Iturbide, in his best\r\ndays, to check or guide it. Public opinion was decidedly opposed to\r\nhis sudden and cruel slaughter. Mexicans candidly acknowledged that\r\ntheir country's independence was owing to him; and whilst they\r\nadmitted that Garza's zeal for the emperor's execution might have been\r\nlawful, they believed that revenge for his former disgrace, rather\r\nthan patriotism, induced the rash and ruthless soldier to hasten the\r\ndeath of the noble victim whom fortune had thrown in his lonely path.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Signature--Augustine de Iturbide)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1824-1829.\r\n\r\n    REVIEW OF THE CONDITION OF MEXICO AND THE FORMATION OF\r\n    PARTIES.--VICEROYAL GOVERNMENT--THE PEOPLE--THE ARMY--THE\r\n    CHURCH.--CONSTITUTION OF 1824.--ECHAVARI REVOLTS.--VICTORIA\r\n    PRESIDENT--ESCOCESSES--YORKINOS--REVOLTS CONTINUED.--\r\n    MONTAYNO--GUERRERO.--GOMEZ PEDRAZA PRESIDENT--IS\r\n    OVERTHROWN.--FEDERALISTS--CENTRALISTS--GUERRERO\r\n    PRESIDENT.--ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN MEXICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must pause a moment over the past history of Mexico, for the\r\nportion we now approach has few of the elements either of union or\r\npatriotism which characterized the early struggles for national\r\nindependence. The revolutionary war had merited and received the\r\ncommendation of freemen throughout the world. The prolonged struggle\r\nexhibited powers of endurance, an unceasing resolution, and a\r\ndetermination to throw off European thraldom, which won the respect of\r\nthose northern powers on this continent who were most concerned in\r\nsecuring to themselves a republican neighborhood. But, as soon as the\r\ndominion of Spain was crushed, the domestic quarrels of Mexico began,\r\nand we have already shown that in the three parties formed in the\r\nfirst congress, were to be found the germs of all the feuds that have\r\nsince vexed the republic or impeded its successful progress towards\r\nnational grandeur. After the country had been so long a battle field,\r\nit was perhaps difficult immediately to accustom the people to civil\r\nrule or to free them from the baleful influence which military glory\r\nis apt to throw round individuals who render important services to\r\ntheir country in war. Even in our own union, where the ballot box\r\ninstead of the bayonet has always controlled elections, and where\r\nloyalty to the constitution would blast the effort of ambitious men to\r\nplace a conqueror in power by any other means than that of peaceful\r\nelection, we constantly find how difficult it is to screen the\r\npeople's eyes from the bewildering glare of military glory. What then\r\ncould we expect from a country in which the self-relying, self-ruling,\r\ncivil idea never existed at any period of its previous history? The\r\nrevolution of the North American colonies was not designed to obtain\r\nliberty, for they were already free; but it was excited and\r\nsuccessfully pursued in order to prevent the burthensome and\r\naggressive impositions of England which would have curtailed that\r\nfreedom, and, reduced us to colonial dependence as well as royal or\r\nministerial dictation. Mexico, on the contrary, had never been free.\r\nSpain regarded the country as a mine which was to be diligently\r\nwrought, and the masses of the people as acclimated serfs whose\r\nservices were the legitimate perquisites of a court and aristocracy\r\nbeyond the sea. There had been, among the kings and viceroys who\r\ncontrolled the destinies of New Spain, men who were swayed by just and\r\namiable views of colonial government; but the majority considered\r\nMexico as a speculation rather than an infant colony whose progressive\r\ndestiny it was their duty to foster with all the care and wisdom of\r\nChristian magistrates. The minor officials misruled and peculated, as\r\nwe have related in our introductory sketch of the viceroyal\r\ngovernment. They were all men of the hour, and, even the viceroys\r\nthemselves, regarded their governments on the American continent as\r\nrewards for services in Europe, enabling them to secure fortunes with\r\nwhich they returned to the Castilian court, forgetful of the Indian\r\nminer and agriculturist from whose sweat their wealth was coined. The\r\nSpaniard never identified himself with Mexico. His _home_ was on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic. Few of the best class formed permanent\r\nestablishments in the viceroyalty; and all of them were too much\r\ninterested in maintaining both the state of society and the _castes_\r\nwhich had been created by the conquerors, to spend a thought upon the\r\namelioration of the people. We do not desire to blacken, by our\r\ncommentary, the fame of a great nation like that of Spain; yet this\r\ndreary but true portrait of national selfishness has been so often\r\nverified by all the colonial historians of America, and especially by\r\nPazo and Zavala, in their admirable historical sketches of Castilian\r\nmisrule, that we deem it fair to introduce these palliations of\r\nMexican misconduct since the revolution.[63]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people of New Spain were poor and uneducated,--the aristocracy was\r\nrich, supercilious, and almost equally illiterate. It was a society\r\nwithout a middle ground,--in which gold stood out in broad relief\r\nagainst rags. Was such a state of barbaric semi-civilization entitled or\r\nfitted to emerge at once into republicanism? Was it to be imagined that\r\nmen who had always been controlled, could learn immediately to control\r\nthemselves? Was it to be believed that the military personages, whose\r\nambition is as proverbial as it is natural, would voluntarily surrender\r\nthe power they possessed over the masses, and retire to the obscurity\r\nand poverty of private life when they could enjoy the wealth and\r\ninfluence of political control, so long as they maintained their rank in\r\nthe army? This would have been too much to expect from the self-denial\r\nof creole chiefs; nor is it surprising to behold the people themselves\r\nlooking towards these very men as proper persons to consolidate or shape\r\nthe government they had established. It was the most natural thing\r\nconceivable to find Iturbide, Guerrero, Bustamante, Negrete, Bravo,\r\nSanta Anna, Paredes, and the whole host of revolutionary heroes\r\nsucceeding each other in power, either constitutionally or by violence.\r\nThe people knew no others. The military idea,--military success,--a name\r\nwon in action, and repeated from lip to lip until the traditionary sound\r\nbecame a household word among the herdsmen, rancheros, vaqueros and\r\nIndians,--these were the sources of Mexican renown or popularity, and\r\nthe appropriate objects of political reward and confidence. What\r\nindividual among the four or five millions of Indians knew anything of\r\nthe statesmen of their country who had never mixed in the revolutionary\r\nwar or in the domestic brawls constantly occurring. There were no\r\ngazettes to spread their fame or merit, and even if there had been, the\r\npeople were unable to buy or peruse them. Among the mixed breeds, and\r\nlower class of creoles, an equal degree of ignorance prevailed;--and\r\nthus, from the first epoch of independence, the PEOPLE ceased to be a\r\ntrue republican tribunal in Mexico, while the city was surrendered as\r\nthe battle field of all the political aspirants who had won reputations\r\nin the camp which were to serve them for other purposes in the capital.\r\nBy this means the army rose to immediate significance and became the\r\ngeneral arbiter in all political controversies. Nor was the\r\nchurch,--that other overshadowing influence in all countries in which\r\nreligion and the state are combined,--a silent spectator in the division\r\nof national power. The Roman Hierarchy, a large landholder,--as will be\r\nhereafter seen in our statistical view of the country,--had much at\r\nstake in Mexico, besides the mere authority which so powerful a body is\r\nalways anxious to maintain over the consciences of the multitude. The\r\nchurch was, thus, a political element of great strength; and, combined\r\nwith the army, created and sustained an important party, which has been\r\nuntiring in its efforts to support _centralism_, as the true political\r\nprinciple of Mexican government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of October, 1824, a federal constitution, framed partly upon\r\nthe model of the constitution of the United States, with some grafts\r\nfrom the Spanish constitution, was adopted by Congress; and, by it, the\r\nterritory comprehended in the old viceroyalty of New Spain, the\r\nCaptaincy General of Yucatan, the commandancies of the eastern and\r\nwestern Internal Provinces, Upper and Lower California, with the lands\r\nand isles adjacent in both seas, were placed under the protection of\r\nthis organic law. The religion of the Mexican nation was declared to be,\r\nin perpetuity, the Catholic Apostolic Roman; and the nation pledged its\r\nprotection, at the same time prohibiting the exercise of any other!\r\n\r\nPrevious, however, to these constitutional enactments the country had\r\nnot been entirely quiet, for as early as January of this year, General\r\nEchavari, who occupied the state of Puebla, raised the standard of\r\nrevolt against the Triumvirate. This seditious movement was soon\r\nsuppressed by the staunch old warrior, Guerrero, who seized and bore the\r\ninsurgent chief to the capital as a prisoner. Another insurrection,\r\noccurred not long after in Cuernavaca, which was also quelled by\r\nGuerrero. Both of these outbreaks were caused by the centralists, who\r\nstrove to put down by violence the popular desire for the federal\r\nsystem. Instead of destroying the favorite charter, however, they only\r\nserved to cement the sections, who sustained liberal doctrines in the\r\ndifferent provinces or states of the nation, and finally, aided\r\nmaterially in enforcing the adoption of the federal system.\r\n\r\nAnother insurrection occurred in the city of Mexico, growing out of\r\nthe old and national animosity between the creoles and the European\r\nSpaniards. The expulsion of the latter from all public employments was\r\ndemanded by the creoles of the capital, backed by the garrison\r\ncommanded by Colonels Lobato and Staboli. The revolt was suppressed at\r\nthe moment; but it was deemed advisable to conciliate feeling in\r\nregard to the unfortunate foreigners; and, accordingly, changes were\r\nmade in the departments, in which the offices were given to native\r\nMexicans, whilst the Spaniards were allowed a pension for life of\r\none-third of their pay. At this period, moreover, the supreme\r\nexecutive power was altered, and Nicolas Bravo, Vicente Guerrero, and\r\nMiguel Dominguez, were appointed to control public affairs until a\r\npresident was elected under the new constitution.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1825, the general congress assembled in the city of Mexico.\r\nGuadalupe Victoria was declared president, and Nicolas Bravo vice\r\npresident. The national finances were recruited by a loan from England;\r\nand a legislative effort was made to narrow the influence of the\r\npriesthood, according to the just limits it should occupy in a republic.\r\n\r\nAll Spanish America had been in a ferment for several years, and the\r\npower of Castile was forever broken on this continent. Peru, as well\r\nas Mexico, had cast off the bonds of dependence, for the brilliant\r\nbattle of Ayacucho rescued the republican banner from the danger with\r\nwhich for a while it was menaced. The European forces had never been\r\nreally formidable, except for their superior discipline and control\r\nunder royalist leaders,--but they were now driven out of the heart of\r\nthe continent,--whilst the few pertinacious troops and generals who\r\nstill remained, were confined to the coasts of Mexico, Peru, and\r\nChili, where they clung to the fortress of San Juan de Ulua, the\r\ncastle of Callao, and the strongholds of Chiloe.\r\n\r\nVictoria was sworn into office on the 15th of April, 1825. Several\r\nforeign nations had already recognized the independence of Mexico, or\r\nsoon hastened to do so; for all were eager to grasp a share of the\r\ncommerce and mines which they imagined had been so profitable to\r\nSpain. The British, especially, who had become holders of Mexican\r\nbonds, were particularly desirous to open commercial intercourse and\r\nto guard it by international treaties.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1826, it was discovered, by the discussions in\r\ncongress of projects for their suppression, that the party leaders,\r\nfearing an open attempt to conduct their unconstitutional\r\nmachinations, had sought the concealment of masonic institutions in\r\nwhich they might foster their antagonistic schemes. The rival lodges\r\nwere designated as Escocesses and Yorkinos, the former numbering among\r\nits members the vice president Nicolas Bravo, Gomez Pedraza, and José\r\nMontayno, while the Yorkinos boasted of Generals Victoria, Santa Anna,\r\nGuerrero, Lorenzo de Zavala, and Bustamante. The adherents of the\r\nEscocesses were said to be in favor of a limited monarchy with a\r\nSpanish prince at its head; but the Yorkinos maintained the supremacy\r\nof the constitution and declared themselves hostile to all movements\r\nof a central character. The latter party was, by far, the most\r\nnumerous. The intelligent liberals of all classes sustained it; yet\r\nits leaders had to contend with the dignitaries of the church, the\r\nopulent agriculturists, land holders and miners, and many of the\r\nhigher officers of the army whose names had been identified with the\r\nearly struggles of the independents against the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThese party discussions, mainly excited by the personal ambitions of the\r\ndisputants, which were carried on not only openly in congress, but\r\nsecretly in the lodges, absorbed for a long time, the entire attention\r\nof the selfish but intelligent persons who should have forgotten\r\nthemselves in the holy purpose of consolidating the free and republican\r\nprinciples of the constitution of 1824. The result of this personal\r\nwarfare was soon exhibited in the total neglect of popular interests, so\r\nfar as they were to be fostered or advanced by the action of congress.\r\nThe states, however, were in some degree, free from these internecine\r\ncontests; for the boldest of the various leaders, and the most ambitious\r\naspirants for power, had left the provinces to settle their quarrels in\r\nthe capital. This was fortunate for the country, inasmuch as the states\r\nwere in some measure recompensed by their own care of the various\r\ndomestic industrial interests for the neglect they suffered at the hands\r\nof national legislators.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1827, Colonel José Montayno, a member of the\r\nEscocesses, proclaimed, in Otumba, the plan which in the history of\r\nMexican _pronunciamientos_, or revolts, is known by the name of this\r\nleader. Another attempt of a similar character had been previously\r\nmade, against the federative system and in favor of centralism, by\r\nPadre Arénas; but both of these outbreaks were not considered\r\ndangerous, until Bravo denounced president Victoria for his union with\r\nthe Yorkinos, and, taking arms against the government, joined the\r\nrebels in Tulancingo, where he declared himself in favor of the\r\ncentral plan of Montayno. The country was aroused. The insurgents\r\nappeared in great strength. The army exhibited decided symptoms of\r\nfavor towards the revolted party; and the church strengthened the\r\nelements of discontent by its secret influence with the people. Such\r\nwas the revolutionary state of Mexico, when the patriot Guerrero was\r\nonce more summoned by the executive to use his energetic efforts in\r\nquelling the insurrection. Nor was he unsuccessful in his loyal\r\nendeavors to support the constitution. As soon as he marched against\r\nthe insurgents, they dispersed throughout the country; so that,\r\nwithout bloodshed, he was enabled to crush the revolt and save the\r\nnation from the civil war. Thus, amid the embittered quarrels of\r\nparties, who had actually designed to transfer their contests from\r\ncongress and lodges to the field of battle, terminated the\r\nadministration of Guadalupe Victoria, the first president of Mexico.\r\nHis successor, Gomez Pedraza, the candidate of the Escocesses, was\r\nelected by a majority of but two votes over his competitor, Guerrero,\r\nthe representative of the liberal Yorkinos.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese internal discontents of Mexico began to inspire the Spanish\r\ncourt with hope that its estranged colony would be induced, or perhaps\r\neasily compelled, after a short time, to return to its allegiance;\r\nand, accordingly, it was soon understood in Mexico, even during\r\nVictoria's administration, that active efforts were making in Cuba to\r\nraise an adequate force for another attempt upon the republic. This,\r\nfor a moment, restrained the fraternal hands raised against each other\r\nwithin the limits of Mexico, and forced all parties to unite against\r\nthe common danger from abroad. Suitable measures were taken to guard\r\nthe coasts where an attack was most imminent, and it was the good\r\nfortune of the government to secure the services of Commodore Porter,\r\na distinguished officer of the United States Navy, who commanded the\r\nMexican squadron most effectively for the protection of the shores\r\nalong the gulf, and took a number of Spanish vessels, even in the\r\nports of Cuba, some of which were laden with large and costly cargoes.\r\n\r\nThe success of the centralist Pedraza over the federalist Guerrero, a\r\nman whose name and reputation were scarcely less dear to the genuine\r\nrepublicans than that of Guadalupe Victoria,--was not calculated to\r\nheal the animosities of the two factions, especially, as the scant\r\nmajority of two votes had placed the _Escoces_ partizan in the\r\npresidential chair. The defeated candidate and his incensed companions\r\nof the liberal lodge, did not exhibit upon this occasion that loyal\r\nobedience to constitutional law, which should have taught them that\r\nthe first duty of a republican is to conceal his mortification at a\r\npolitical defeat and to bow reverentially to the lawful decision of a\r\nmajority. It is a subject of deep regret that the first bold and\r\nsuccessful attack upon the organic law of Mexico was made by the\r\nfederalists. They may have deemed it their duty to prevent their\r\nunreliable competitors from controlling the destinies of Mexico even\r\nfor a moment under the sanction of the constitution; but there can be\r\nno doubt that they should have waited until acts, instead of\r\nsuspicions or fears, entitled them to exercise their right of\r\nimpeachment under the constitution. In an unregulated, military\r\nnation, such as Mexico was at that period, men do not pause for the\r\nslow operations of law when there is a personal or a party quarrel in\r\nquestion. The hot blood of the impetuous, tropical region, combines\r\nwith the active intellectual temperament of the people, and laws and\r\nconstitutions are equally disregarded under the impulse of passion or\r\ninterest. Such was the case in the present juncture. The Yorkinos had\r\nbeen outvoted lawfully, according to the solemn record of congress,\r\nyet they resolved not to submit; and, accordingly, Lorenzo de Zavala,\r\nthe Grand Master of their lodge, and Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who\r\nwas then a professed _federalist_, in conjunction with the defeated\r\ncandidate Guerrero and Generals Montezuma and Lobato, determined to\r\nprevent Pedraza from occupying the chair of state. Santa Anna, who now\r\nappeared prominently on the stage, was the chief agitator in the\r\nscheme, and being in garrison at Jalapa, in the autumn of 1828,\r\npronounced against the chief magistrate elect, and denounced his\r\nnomination as \"illegal, fraudulent and unconstitutional.\" The movement\r\nwas popular, for the people were in fact friendly to Guerrero. The\r\nprejudices of the native or creole party against the Spaniards and\r\ntheir supposed defenders the Escocesses, were studiously fomented in\r\nthe capital; and, on the 4th of December, the pronunciamiento of the\r\nAccordada, in the capital, seconded the sedition of Santa Anna in the\r\nprovinces. By this time the arch conspirator in this drama had reached\r\nthe metropolis and labored to control the elements of disorder which\r\nwere at hand to support his favorite Guerrero. The defenceless\r\nSpaniards were relentlessly assailed by the infuriate mob which was\r\nlet loose upon them by the insurgent chiefs. Guerrero was in the field\r\nin person at the head of the Yorkinos. The Parian in the capital, and\r\nthe dwellings of many of the noted Escocesses were attacked and\r\npillaged, and for some time the city was given up to anarchy and\r\nbloodshed. Pedraza, who still fulfilled the functions of minister of\r\nwar previous to his inauguration, fled from the official post which he\r\nabandoned to his rival Santa Anna; and on the 1st of January, 1829,\r\ncongress,--reversing its former act,--declared Guerrero to have been\r\nduly elected president of the republic! General Bustamante was chosen\r\nvice president, and the government again resumed its operation under\r\nthe federal system of 1824.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Although a masked Indian slavery or _peonage_, is permitted\r\n    and encouraged in Mexico, African slavery is prohibited by\r\n    positive enactments as well as by the constitution itself. But as\r\n    it may interest the reader to know the Mexican enactments relative\r\n    to negroes, on this subject, the following documents are subjoined\r\n    for  reference:--\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n    _The President of the Mexican United States to the Inhabitants of\r\n    the Republic._\r\n\r\n    BE IT KNOWN--That, being desirous to signalize the anniversary of\r\n    independence, in the year 1829, by an act of national justice and\r\n    beneficence, which may redound to the advantage and support of so\r\n    inestimable a good; which may further insure the public\r\n    tranquillity; which may tend to the aggrandisement of the\r\n    republic, and may reinstate an unfortunate portion of its\r\n    inhabitants in the sacred rights which nature gave to them, and\r\n    the nation should protect by wise and just laws, conformably with\r\n    the dispositions of the thirtieth article of the constituent act,\r\n    employing the extrordinary faculties which have been conceded to\r\n    me, I have resolved to decree--\r\n\r\n    1. Slavery is and shall remain abolished in the republic.\r\n\r\n    2. In consequence, those who have hitherto been regarded as\r\n    slaves, are free.\r\n\r\n    3. Whensoever the condition of the treasury shall permit, the\r\n    owners of the slaves shall be indemnified according to the terms\r\n    which the law may dispose.\r\n\r\n    GUERRERO.\r\n\r\n  _Mexico, Sept. 15, 1829._\r\n\r\nMEXICAN LAW FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n    ART. 1.--Slavery is abolished, without any exception, throughout\r\n    the whole republic.\r\n\r\n    2.

The indemnification mentioned in\r\n    this article shall not be extended to the colonists of Texas, who\r\n    may have taken part in the revolution in that department.\r\n\r\n    3. The owners to whom the original documents drawn up with regard to\r\n    the proofs mentioned in the preceding article, shall be delivered\r\n    gratis--shall themselves present them to the supreme government,\r\n    which will authorise the general treasury to issue to them the\r\n    corresponding orders for the amount of their respective interests.\r\n\r\n    4. The payment of the said orders shall be made in the manner\r\n    which may seem most equitable to the government, with the view of\r\n    reconciling the rights of individuals with the actual state of the\r\n    public finances.\r\n\r\n  _April 5, 1837._\r\n\r\n    The Constitution of 1843, or _Bases organicas de la Republica\r\n    Mejicana_, of that year, declares that: \"_No one is a slave in the\r\n    territory of the nation_, and that any slave who may be\r\n    introduced, shall be considered free and remain under the\r\n    protection of the laws.\"--_Title_ 2d.\r\n\r\n    The Constitution of 1847--which, in fact, is the old Federal\r\n    Constitution of 1824--does not rëenact this clause; but, in the\r\n    _Acta de Reformas_ annexed to it in 1847, declares, \"that _every\r\n    Mexican_, either by birth or naturalization, who has attained the\r\n    age of twenty years, who possesses the means of an honest\r\n    livelihood, and who has not been condemned by legal process to any\r\n    infamous punishment, _is a citizen_ of the United Mexican\r\n    States.\"--_Acta de Reformas, Article 1._ \"In order to secure the\r\n    _rights of man_ which the Constitution recognizes, _a law_ shall\r\n    fix the guaranties of _liberty_, security, property and\r\n    _equality_, which _all the inhabitants of the republic enjoy_, and\r\n    shall establish the means requisite to make them effective.\"--_1d.\r\n    Article 5._ The third article provides that \"the exercise of the\r\n    rights of citizenship _are suspended_ by habitual intemperance; by\r\n    professional gambling or vagabondage; by religious orders; by\r\n    legal interdict in virtue of trial for those crimes which forfeit\r\n    citizenship, and by refusal to fulfil public duties imposed by\r\n    popular nomination\" (_nombramiento popular_.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Zavala's Hist.

Scarcely had Guerrero been\r\nseated in the chair of state when it became known that there was a\r\nconspiracy to displace him. He had been induced by the condition of\r\nthe country, and by the bad advice of his enemies to assume the\r\nauthority of dictator. This power, he alleged, was exercised only for\r\nthe suppression of the intriguing Escocesses; but its continued\r\nexercise served as a pretext at least, for the vice president, General\r\nBustamante, to place himself at the head of a republican division and\r\npronounce against the president he had so recently contributed to\r\nplace in power. The executive commanded Santa Anna to advance against\r\nthe assailants; but this chief, at first, feebly opposed the\r\ninsurgents, and, finally, fraternizing with Bustamante, marched on the\r\ncapital whence they drove Guerrero and his partisans to Valladolid in\r\nMichoacan. Here the dethroned dictator organized a government, whilst\r\nthe usurping vice president, Bustamante, assumed the reins in the\r\ncapital. In Michoacan, Guerrero, who was well known and loved for his\r\nrevolutionary enterprises in the west of Mexico, found no difficulty\r\nin recruiting a force with which he hoped to regain his executive\r\npost. Congress was divided in opinion between the rival factions of\r\nthe liberalists, and the republic was shaken by the continual strife,\r\nuntil Bustamante despatched a powerful division against Guerrero,\r\nwhich defeated, and dispersed his army. This was the conclusion of\r\nthat successful warrior's career. He was a good soldier but a\r\nmiserable statesman. His private character and natural disposition are\r\nrepresented, by those who knew him best, to have been irreproachable;\r\nyet he was fitted alone for the early struggles of Mexico in the\r\nfield, and was so ignorant of the administrative functions needed in\r\nhis country at such a period, that it is not surprising to find he had\r\nbeen used as a tool, and cast aside when the service for which his\r\nintriguing coadjutors required him was performed. His historical\r\npopularity and character rendered him available for a reckless party\r\nin overthrowing a constitutional election; and, even when beaten by\r\nthe new usurper, and with scarcely the shadow of a party in the\r\nnation, it was still feared that his ancient usefulness in the wars of\r\nindependence, might render him again the nucleus of political\r\ndiscontent. Accordingly, the pursuit of Guerrero was not abandoned\r\nwhen his army fled. The west coast was watched by the myrmidons of the\r\nusurpers, and the war-worn hero was finally betrayed on board a vessel\r\nby a spy, where he was arrested for bearing arms against the\r\ngovernment of which he was the real head, according to the solemn\r\ndecision of congress! In February, 1831, a court martial, ordered by\r\nGeneral Montezuma tried him for this pretended crime. His sentence\r\nwas, of course, known as soon as his judges were named; and, thus,\r\nanother chief of the revolutionary war was rewarded by death for his\r\npatriotic services. We cannot regard this act of Bustamante and Santa\r\nAnna, except as a deliberate murder for which they richly deserve the\r\ncondemnation of impartial history, even if they had no other crimes to\r\nanswer at the bar of God and their country.\r\n\r\nWhilst these internal contests were agitating the heart of Mexico, an\r\nexpedition had been fitted out at Havana composed of four thousand\r\ntroops commanded by Barradas, designed to invade the lost colony and\r\nrestore it to the Spanish crown. The accounts given of this force and\r\nits condition when landed at Tampico, vary according to the partizans\r\nby whom they are written; but there is reason to believe that the\r\nSpanish troops were so weakened by disease and losses in the summer of\r\n1830, that when Santa Anna and a French officer,--Colonel\r\nWoll--attacked them in the month of September, they fell an easy prey\r\ninto the hands of the Mexicans. Santa Anna, however, with his usual\r\ntalent for such composition, magnified the defeat into a magnificent\r\nconquest. He was hailed as the victor who broke the last link between\r\nSpain and her viceroyalty. Pompous bulletins and despatches were\r\npublished in the papers; and the commander-in-chief returned to the\r\ncapital, covered with honors, as the saviour of the republic.\r\n\r\nThere is an anecdote connected with the final expulsion of the Spaniards\r\nfrom Mexico, which deserves to be recorded as it exhibits a fact which\r\nsuperstitious persons might conceive to be the avenging decree of\r\nretributive providence. Doña Isabel Montezuma, the eldest daughter of\r\nthe unfortunate Emperor had been married to his successor on the Aztec\r\nthrone, and, after his wretched death, was united to various\r\ndistinguished Spaniards, the last of whom was Juan Andrade, ancestor of\r\nthe Andrade Montezumas and Counts of Miravalle. General Miguel Barragan,\r\nwho afterwards became president _ad interim_ of Mexico, and to whom the\r\ncastle of San Juan de Ulua was surrendered by the European forces--was\r\nmarried to Manuela Trebuesta y Casasola, daughter of the _last_ Count of\r\nMiravalle, and it is thus a singular coincidence that the husband of a\r\nlady who was the legitimate descendant of Montezuma, should have been\r\ndestined to receive the keys of the _last_ stronghold on which the\r\nSpanish banner floated on this continent![64]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy intrigue and victories Santa Anna had acquired so much popular\r\nrenown throughout the country and with the army that he found the time\r\nwas arriving when he might safely avail himself of his old and recent\r\nservices against Iturbide and Barradas. Under the influence of his\r\nmachinations Bustamante began to fail in popular estimation. He was\r\nspoken of as a tyrant; his administration was characterized as\r\ninauspicious; and the public mind was gradually prepared for an\r\noutbreak in 1832. Santa Anna, who had, in fact, placed and sustained\r\nBustamante in power, was, in reality, the instigator of this revolt.\r\nThe ambitious chief, first of all issued his _pronunciamiento_ against\r\nthe ministry of the president, and then, shortly after, against that\r\nfunctionary himself. But Bustamante, a man of nerve and capacity, was\r\nnot to be destroyed as easily as his victim, Guerrero. He threw\r\nhimself at the head of his loyal troops and encountering the rebels at\r\nTolomi routed them completely. Santa Anna, therefore, retired to Vera\r\nCruz, and, strengthening his forces from some of the other states,\r\ndeclared himself in favor of the restoration of the constitutional\r\npresident Pedraza, whom he had previously driven out of Mexico. As\r\nBustamante advanced towards the coast his army melted away. The\r\ncountry was opposed to him. He was wise enough to perceive that his\r\nusurped power was lost; and prudently entered into a pacific\r\nconvention with Santa Anna at Zavaleta in December, 1832. The\r\nsuccessful insurgent immediately despatched a vessel for the banished\r\nPedraza, and brought him back to the capital to serve out the\r\nremaining three months of his unexpired administration!\r\n\r\nThe object of Santa Anna in restoring Pedraza was not to sustain any\r\none of the old parties which had now become strangely mingled and\r\nconfused by the factions or ambitions of all the leaders. His main\r\ndesign was to secure the services and influence of the centralists, as\r\nfar as they were yet available, in controlling his election to the\r\npresidency upon which he had fixed his heart. On the 16th of May,\r\n1833, he reached the goal of his ambition.[65]\r\n\r\nThe congress of 1834 was unquestionably federal republican in its\r\ncharacter, and Santa Anna seemed to be perfectly in accord with his\r\nvice presidential compeer, Gomez Farias. But the church,--warned by a\r\nbill introduced into congress the previous year by Zavala, by which he\r\naimed a blow at the temporalities of the spiritual lords,--did not\r\nremain contented spectators while the power reposed in the hands of\r\nhis federal partizans. The popular representatives were accordingly\r\napproached by skilful emissaries, and it was soon found that the\r\ncentralists were strongly represented in a body hitherto regarded as\r\naltogether republican. It is charged in Mexico, that bribery was\r\nfreely resorted to; and, when the solicitations became sufficiently\r\npowerful, even the inflexible patriotism of Santa Anna yielded, though\r\nthe vice president Farias, remained incorruptible.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1834, the president suddenly and unwarrantably\r\ndissolved congress, and maintained his arbitrary decree and power by\r\nthe army, which was entirely at his service. In the following year,\r\nGomez Farias was deposed from the vice presidency by the venal\r\ncongress, and Barragan raised to the vacant post. The militia was\r\ndisarmed, the central forces strengthened, and the people placed\r\nentirely at the mercy of the executive and his minions, who completed\r\nthe destruction of the constitution of 1824 by blotting it from the\r\nstatute book of Mexico.\r\n\r\nPuebla, Jalisco, Oaxaca, parts of Mexico, Zacatecas and Texas revolted\r\nagainst this assumption of the centralists, though they were finally not\r\nable to maintain absolutely their free stand against the dictator.\r\nZacatecas and Texas, alone, presented a formidable aspect to Santa Anna,\r\nwho was, nevertheless, too strong and skilful for the ill regulated\r\nforces of the former state. The victorious troops entered the rebellious\r\ncapital with savage fury; and, after committing the most disgusting acts\r\nof brutality and violence against all classes and sexes, they disarmed\r\nthe citizens entirely and placed a military governor over the province.\r\nIn Coahuila and Texas, symptoms of discontent were far more important,\r\nfor the federalists met at Monclova, and, after electing Agustin Viesca\r\ngovernor, defied the opposite faction by which a military officer had\r\nbeen assigned to perform the execute the duties of the state. General\r\nCos, however, soon dispersed the legislature by violence and imprisoned\r\nthe governor and his companions whom he arrested as they were hastening\r\nto cross the Rio Grande. These evil doings were regarded sorrowfully but\r\nsternly by the North Americans who had flocked to Texas, under the\r\nsanctions and assurances of the federal constitution, and they resolved\r\nnot to countenance the usurpation of their unquestionable rights.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs in the Mexican Republic when the PLAN OF\r\nTOLUCA was issued, by which the federal constitution was absolutely\r\nabolished, and the principles of a consolidated central government\r\nfully announced. Previous to this, however, a _pronunciamiento_ had\r\nbeen made by a certain Escalada at Morelia, in favor of the _fueros_,\r\nor especial privileges and rights of the church and army. This\r\noutbreak was, of course, central in its character; whilst another\r\nferment in Cuautla had been productive of Santa Anna's nomination as\r\ndictator, an office which he promptly refused to accept.\r\n\r\nThe Plan of Toluca was unquestionably favored by Santa Anna who had\r\ngone over to the centralists. It was a scheme designed to test\r\nnational feeling and to prepare the people for the overthrow of state\r\ngovernments. The supreme power was vested by it in the executive and\r\nnational congress; and the states were changed into departments under\r\nthe command of military governors, who were responsible for their\r\ntrust to the chief national authorities instead of the people. Such\r\nwas the Central Constitution of 1836.\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable that Santa Anna's prudent care of himself and his\r\npopularity, as well as his military patriotism induced him to leave\r\nthe government in the hands of the vice president Barragan whilst the\r\nnew constitution was under discussion, and to lead the Mexican troops,\r\npersonally, against the revolted Texans, who had never desisted from\r\nopen hostility to the central usurpations. But as the history of that\r\nluckless expedition is to be recounted elsewhere in this volume, we\r\nshall content ourselves with simply recording the fact that on the\r\n21st of April, 1836, the president and his army were completely routed\r\nby General Houston and the Texans; and, that instead of returning to\r\nthe metropolis crowned with glory, as he had done from the capture of\r\nBarradas, Santa Anna owed his life to the generosity of the Texan\r\ninsurgents whose companions in arms had recently been butchered by his\r\norders at Goliad and San Antonio de Bejar.[66]\r\n\r\nDuring Santa Anna's absence, vice president Barragan filled the\r\nexecutive office up to the time of his death, when he was succeeded by\r\nCoro, until the return from France of Bustamante, who had been elected\r\npresident under the new central constitution of 1836. In the following\r\nyear Santa Anna was sent back to Mexico in a vessel of the United\r\nStates government. But he was a disgraced man in the nation's eyes. He\r\nreturned to his _hacienda_ of Manga de Clavo, and burying himself for\r\na while in obscurity, was screened from the open manifestation of\r\npopular odium. Here he lurked until the brilliant attempt was made to\r\ndisenthral his country by Mexia, in 1838. Demanding, once more, the\r\nprivilege of leading the army, he was entrusted with its command, and,\r\nencountering the defender of federation in the neighborhood of Puebla,\r\nhe gave him battle immediately. Mexia lost the day; and, with brief\r\ntime for shrift or communication with his family, he was condemned by\r\na drum-head court martial and shot upon the field of battle. This was\r\na severe doom; but the personal animosity between the commanders was\r\nequally unrelenting, for when the sentence was announced to the brave\r\nbut rash Mexia, he promptly and firmly declared that Santa Anna was\r\nright to execute him on the spot, inasmuch, as he would not have\r\ngranted the usurper half the time that elapsed since his capture, had\r\nit been his destiny to prove victorious!\r\n\r\nSoon after the accession of Bustamante there had been _gritos_ in\r\nfavor of federation and Gomez Farias, who was, at that period,\r\nimprisoned; but these trifling outbreaks were merely local and easily\r\nsuppressed by Pedraza and Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1838, however, Mexico was more severely threatened\r\nfrom abroad than she had recently been by her internal discords. It\r\nwas at this time that a French fleet appeared at Vera Cruz, under the\r\norders of Admiral Baudin, to demand satisfaction for injuries to\r\nFrench subjects, and unsettled pecuniary claims which had been long\r\nand unavailingly subjects of diplomacy. Distracted for years by\r\ninternal broils that paralyzed the industry of the country ever since\r\nthe outbreak of the revolution, Mexico was in no condition to respond\r\npromptly to demands for money. But national pride forbade the idea of\r\nsurrendering without a blow. The military resources of the country and\r\nof the Castle of San Juan de Ulua, were, accordingly, mustered with\r\ndue celerity, and the assailed department of Vera Cruz entrusted to\r\nthe defence of Santa Anna, whose fame had been somewhat refreshed by\r\nhis victory over Mexia. Meanwhile the French fleet kept up a stringent\r\nblockade of Vera Cruz, and still more crippled the commercial revenues\r\nof Mexico by cutting off the greater part of its most valuable trade.\r\nFinding, however, that neither the blockade nor additional diplomacy\r\nwould induce the stubborn government to accede to terms which the\r\nMexicans knew would finally be forced on them, the French squadron\r\nattacked the city with forces landed from the vessels, whilst they\r\nassailed the redoubtable castle with three frigates, a corvette and\r\ntwo bomb vessels, whence, during an action of six hours, they threw\r\nthree hundred and two shells, one hundred and seventy-seven paixhan,\r\nand seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-one solid shot. The\r\nassaults upon the town were not so successful as those on the castle,\r\nwhere the explosion of a magazine forced the Mexicans to surrender.\r\nThe troops that had been landed were not numerous enough to hold the\r\nadvantages they gained; and it was in gallantly repulsing a storming\r\nparty at the gates of the city, that Santa Anna lost a leg by a\r\nparting shot from a small piece of ordnance as the French retreated on\r\nthe quay to their boats.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the castle, however, placed the city at the mercy of the\r\nFrench, and the Mexicans were soon induced to enter into satisfactory\r\nstipulations for the adjustment of all debts and difficulties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1839, General Canales fomented a revolt in some of the\r\nnorth-eastern departments. The proposal of this insurgent was to form\r\na republican confederation of Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and Durango, which\r\nthree states or departments, he designed should adopt for themselves\r\nthe federal constitution of 1824, and, assuming the title of the\r\nindependent \"Republic of the Rio Grande,\" should pledge themselves to\r\nco-operate with Texas against Bustamante and the centralists. An\r\nalliance was entered into with Texas to that effect, and an expedition\r\nof united Texans and Republicans of the Rio Grande, was set on foot to\r\noccupy Coahuila; but at the appearance of General Arista in the field\r\nearly in 1840, and after an action in which the combined forces were\r\ndefeated, Canales left the discomfitted Texans to seek safety by\r\nhastening back to their own territory.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Bustamante was sorely tried by foreign and\r\ndomestic broils, for, whilst Texas and the Republic of the Rio Grande\r\nwere assailing him in the north, the federalists attacked him in the\r\ncapital, and the Yucatecos revolted in the south. This last outbreak\r\nwas not quelled as easily as the rebellion in the north; nor was it,\r\nin fact, until long afterwards during another administration, that the\r\npeople of the Peninsula were again induced to return to their\r\nallegiance. Bustamante seems to have vexed the Yucatecos by unwise\r\ninterference in the commercial and industrial interests of the\r\ncountry. The revolt was temporarily successful; On the 31st of March,\r\n1841, a constitution was proclaimed in Yucatan, which erected it into\r\na free and sovereign state, and exempted the people from many burdens\r\nas well as the odious intolerance of all other religions except the\r\nRoman Catholic, that had been imposed by both the federal constitution\r\nof 1824 and the central one of 1836.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe discontent with Bustamante's administration, arising chiefly from\r\na consumption duty of 15 per cent. which had been imposed by congress,\r\nwas now well spread throughout the republic. The pronunciamiento of\r\nUrrea on the 15th of July, 1840, at the palace of Mexico was mainly an\r\neffort of the federalists to put down violently the constitution of\r\n1836; and although the insurgents had possession, at one period, of\r\nthe person of the president, yet the revolt was easily suppressed by\r\nValencia and his faithful troops in the capital.\r\n\r\nBut, a year later, the revolutionary spirit had ripened into readiness\r\nfor successful action. We have reason to believe that the most\r\nextensive combinations were made by active agents in all parts of\r\nMexico to ensure the downfall of Bustamante and the elevation of Santa\r\nAnna. Accordingly, in August, 1841, a _pronunciamiento_ of General\r\nParedes, in Guadalajara, was speedily responded to by Valencia and\r\nLombardini in the capital, and by Santa Anna himself at Vera Cruz. But\r\nthe outbreak was not confined merely to proclamations or the adhesion\r\nof military garrisons; for a large body of troops and citizens\r\ncontinued loyal to the president and resolved to sustain the\r\ngovernment in the capital. This fierce fidelity to the constitution on\r\nthe one hand, and bitter hostility to the chief magistrate on the\r\nother, resulted in one of the most sanguinary conflicts that had taken\r\nplace in Mexico since the early days of independence. For a whole\r\nmonth the contest was carried on with balls and grape shot in the\r\nstreets of Mexico, whilst the rebels, who held the citadel outside the\r\ncity, finished the shameless drama, by throwing a shower of bombs into\r\nthe metropolis, shattering the houses, and involving innocent and\r\nguilty, citizens, strangers, combatants and non-combatants, in a\r\ncommon fate. This cowardly assault under the orders of Valencia, was\r\nmade solely with the view of forcing the citizens, who were\r\nunconcerned in the quarrel between the factions, into insisting upon\r\nthe surrender of Mexico, in order to save their town and families from\r\ndestruction. There was a faint show of military man[oe]uvres in the\r\nfields adjoining the city; but the troops on both sides shrank from\r\nbattle when they were removed from the protecting shelter of walls and\r\nhouses. At length, the intervention of Mexican citizens who were most\r\ninterested in the cessation of hostilities, produced an arrangement\r\nbetween the belligerants at Estanzuela near the capital, and, finally,\r\nthe PLAN OF TACUBAYA was agreed on by the chiefs--as a substitute for\r\nthe constitution of 1836. By the seventh article of this document,\r\nSanta Anna was effectually invested with dictatorial powers until a\r\nnew constitution was formed.\r\n\r\nThe Plan of Tacubaya provided that a congress should be convened, in\r\n1842, to form a new constitution, and in June, a body of patriotic\r\ncitizens, chosen by the people, assembled for that purpose in the\r\nmetropolis. Santa Anna opened the session with a speech in which he\r\nannounced his predilection for a strong central government, but he\r\nprofessed perfect willingness to yield to whatever might be the\r\ndecision of congress. Nevertheless, in December of the same year,\r\nafter the assembly had made two efforts to form a constitution\r\nsuitable to the country and the cabinet, president Santa Anna,--in\r\nspite of his professed submission to the national will expressed\r\nthrough the representatives,--suddenly and unauthorizedly, dissolved\r\nthe congress. It was a daring act; but Santa Anna knew that he could\r\nrely upon his troops, his officers, and the mercantile classes for\r\nsupport. The capital wanted quietness for a while; and the interests\r\nof trade as well as the army united in confidence in the strong will\r\nof one who was disposed to maintain order by force.\r\n\r\nAfter congress had been dissolved by Santa Anna, there was, of course,\r\nno further necessity of an appeal to the people. The nation had\r\nspoken, but its voice was disregarded. Nothing therefore remained,\r\nsave to allow the dictator, himself, to frame the organic laws; and\r\nfor this purpose he appointed a Junta of Notables, who proclaimed, on\r\nthe 13th of June, 1843, an instrument which never took the name of a\r\nconstitution, but bore the mongrel title of \"Bases of the Political\r\nOrganization of the Mexican Republic.\" It is essentially _central_, in\r\nits provisions; and whilst it is as intolerant upon the subject of\r\nreligion, as the two former fundamental systems, it is even less\r\npopular in its general provisions than the constitution of 1836.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Alaman Disertaciones, vol. i, p. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: The following letter from Santa Anna to a distinguished\r\nforeigner, will afford the reader a specimen of his personal modesty\r\nand political humility. The individual to whom it was written, was\r\nafterwards expelled by Santa Anna from the republic during his\r\npresidency, after having been invited by him to the country:\r\n\r\n  \"VERA CRUZ, October 11th, 1831.\r\n\r\n\"MY ESTEEMED FRIEND:--I have the pleasure to answer your favor of the\r\n5th ultimo, by which I perceive that my letter of the 9th of April\r\nlast, came to hand. I have received the prospectus of the \"Foreign\r\nCollege\" you contemplate to establish, which not only meets with my\r\nentire approbation, but, considering your talents and uncommon\r\nacquirements, I congratulate you on employing them in a manner so\r\ngenerally useful, and personally honorable. I thank you cordially for\r\nthe news and observations you have had the kindness to communicate to\r\nme, and both make me desire the continuation of your esteemed\r\nepistles. _Retired as I am, on my farm, and there exclusively devoted\r\nto the cultivation and improvement of my small estate, I cannot reply,\r\nas I desire, to the news with which you have favored me._ But, even in\r\nthat retirement, and though separated from the arena of politics, I\r\ncould never view with indifference any discredit thrown on my country,\r\nnor any thing which might, in the smallest degree, possess that\r\ntendency. We enjoy at present peace and tranquillity, and I do not\r\nknow of any other question of public interest now in agitation, than\r\nthe approaching _elections of President_ and Vice President. When that\r\nperiod shall arrive, should I obtain a majority of suffrages, I am\r\n_ready to accept_ the honor, and to sacrifice, for the benefit of the\r\nnation my repose and the charms of private life. _My fixed system is\r\nto be called_ (ser llamado), resembling in this a _modest maid_\r\n(modesta doncella), _who rather expects to be desired, than to show\r\nherself to be desiring_. I think that my position justifies me in this\r\nrespect. Nevertheless, as what is written in a foreign country has\r\nmuch influence at home, especially among us, in your city I think it\r\nproper to _make a great step on this subject_; and by fixing the true\r\naspect, in which such or such services should be regarded, as respects\r\nthe various candidates, one could undoubtedly contribute _to fix here\r\npublic opinion, which is at present extremely wavering and uncertain_.\r\nOf course, this is the peculiar province of the friends of Mexico; and\r\nas well by this title, as on account of the acquirements and\r\ninstruction you possess, _I know of no one better qualified than\r\nyourself to execute such a benevolent undertaking_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will favor me from time to time with information, which\r\nwill always give satisfaction to your _true friend_ and servant, who\r\nkisses your hands.\"\r\n\r\n  \"ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: See Gen. Waddy Thompson's Recollections of Mexico, p.\r\n69, for Santa Anna's wretched vindication of these sanguinary deeds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1843-1846.\r\n\r\n    RECONQUEST OF TEXAS PROPOSED.--CANALIZO PRESIDENT AD\r\n    INTERIM.--REVOLUTION UNDER PAREDES IN 1844.--SANTA ANNA\r\n    FALLS--HERRERA PRESIDENT--TEXAN REVOLT.--ORIGIN OF WAR WITH\r\n    THE UNITED STATES.--TEXAN WAR FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF\r\n    1824--NATIONALITY RECOGNIZED--ANNEXATION TO THE UNITED\r\n    STATES.--PROPOSITION TO MEXICO.--HERRERA OVERTHROWN--PAREDES\r\n    PRESIDENT--OUR MINISTER REJECTED.--CHARACTER OF GENERAL PAREDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the foundation of the new system in 1843, the country continued\r\nquiet for a while, and when the Mexican Congress met, in January 1844,\r\npropositions were made by the executive department to carry out Santa\r\nAnna's favorite project of reconquering Texas. It is probable that\r\nthere was not much sincerity in the president's desire to march his\r\ntroops into a territory the recollection of which must have been, at\r\nleast, distasteful to him. There is more reason to believe that the\r\nlarge sum which it was necessary to appropriate for the expenses of\r\nthe campaign--the management of which would belong to the\r\nadministration,--was the real object he had in view. Four millions\r\nwere granted for the reconquest, but when Santa Anna demanded ten\r\nmillions more while the first grant was still uncollected, the members\r\nrefused to sustain the president's demand. The congressmen were\r\nconvinced of that chieftain's rapacity, and resolved to afford him no\r\nfurther opportunity to plunder the people under the guise of patriotism.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna's sagacious knowledge of his countrymen immediately\r\napprised him of approaching danger, and having obtained permission\r\nfrom congress to retire to his estate at Mango de Clavo, near Vera\r\nCruz, he departed from the capital, leaving his friend General\r\nCanalizo as president _ad interim_. Hardly had he reached his\r\nplantation in the midst of friends and faithful troops, when a revolt\r\nburst out in Jalisco, Agnas Calientes, Zacatecas, Sinaloa and Sonora,\r\nagainst his government, headed by General Paredes. Santa Anna rapidly\r\ncrossed the country to suppress the rebellion, but as he disobeyed\r\nthe constitutional compact by taking actual command of the army whilst\r\nhe was president, without the previous assent of congress, he became\r\namenable to law for this violation of his oath. He was soon at enmity\r\nwith the rebels and with the constitutional congress, and thus a three\r\nfold contest was carried on, chiefly through correspondence, until the\r\n4th of January, 1845, when Santa Anna finally fell. He fled from the\r\ninsurgents and constitutional authorities towards the eastern coast,\r\nbut being captured at the village of Jico, was conducted to Peroté,\r\nwhere he remained imprisoned under a charge and examination for\r\ntreason, until an amnesty for the late political factionists permitted\r\nhim to depart on the 29th of May, 1845, with his family, for Havana.\r\n\r\nUpon Santa Anna's ejection from the executive chair, the president of\r\nthe council of government, became under the laws of the country,\r\nprovisional president of the republic. This person was General José\r\nJoaquim de Herrera, during whose administration the controversies rose\r\nwhich resulted in the war between Mexico and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe thread of policy and action in both countries is so closely\r\ninterwoven during this pernicious contest, that the history of the war\r\nbecomes, in reality, the history of Mexico for the epoch. We are\r\ntherefore compelled to narrate, succinctly, the circumstances that led\r\nto that lamentable issue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first _empresario_, or contractor, for the colonization of Texas,\r\nwas Moses Austin, a native citizen of the United States, who, as soon\r\nas the treaty of limits between Spain and our country was concluded in\r\n1819, conceived the project of establishing a settlement in that\r\nregion. Accordingly, in 1821 he obtained from the Commandant General\r\nof the Provincias Internas, permission to introduce three hundred\r\nforeign families. In 1823, a national colonization law was approved by\r\nthe Mexican Emperor Iturbide during his brief reign, and on the 18th\r\nof February, Stephen F. Austin, who had succeeded his father, after\r\nhis death, in carrying out the project, was authorized to proceed with\r\nthe founding of the colony. After the emperor's fall, this decree was\r\nconfirmed by the first executive council in conformity to the express\r\nwill of congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 the _federal_ constitution of Mexico was, as we have narrated,\r\nadopted, by the republican representatives, upon principles analogous\r\nto those of the constitution of the United States; and by a decree of\r\nthe 7th of May, Texas and Coahuila were united in a _state_. In this\r\nyear another _general_ colonization law was enacted by congress, and\r\nforeigners were invited to the new domain by a special state\r\ncolonization law of Coahuila and Texas.\r\n\r\nUnder these local laws and constitutional guaranties, large numbers of\r\nforeigners flocked to this portion of Mexico, opened farms, founded\r\ntowns and villages, re-occupied old Spanish settlements, introduced\r\nimprovements in agriculture and manufactures, drove off the Indians,\r\nand formed, in fact, the nucleus of an enterprizing and progressive\r\npopulation. But there were jealousies between the race that invited\r\nthe colonists, and the colonists who accepted the invitation. The\r\ncentral power in the distant capital did not estimate, at their just\r\nvalue, the independence of the remote pioneers, or the state-right\r\nsovereignty to which they had been accustomed at their former home in\r\nthe United States. Mexico was convulsed by revolutions, but the lonely\r\nresidents of Texas paid no attention to the turmoils of the\r\nfactionists. At length, however, direct acts of interference upon the\r\npart of the national government, not only by its ministerial agents,\r\nbut by its legislature, excited the mingled alarm and indignation of\r\nthe colonists, who imagined that in sheltering themselves under a\r\nrepublic they were protected as amply as they would have been under\r\nthe constitution of the North American Union. In this they were\r\ndisappointed; for, in 1830, an arbitrary enactment--based no doubt\r\nupon a jealous dread of the growing value and size of a colony which\r\nformed a link between the United States and Mexico by resting against\r\nTamaulipas and Louisiana, on the north and south,--prohibited entirely\r\nthe future immigration of American settlers into Coahuila and Texas.\r\nTo enforce this decree and to watch the loyalty of the actual\r\ninhabitants, military posts, composed of rude and ignorant Mexican\r\nsoldiers, were sprinkled over the country. And, at last, the people of\r\nTexas found themselves entirely under military control.\r\n\r\nThis suited neither the principles nor tastes of the colonists, who,\r\nin 1832, took arms against this warlike interference with their\r\nmunicipal liberty, and after capturing the fort at Velasco, reduced to\r\nsubmission the garrisons at Anahuac and Nacogdoches. The separate\r\nstate constitution which had been promised Texas in 1824, was never\r\nsanctioned by the Mexican Congress, though the colonists prepared the\r\ncharter and were duly qualified for admission. But the crisis arrived\r\nwhen the centralists of 1835, overthrew the federal constitution of\r\n1824. Several Mexican states rose independently against the despotic\r\nact. Zacatecas fought bravely for her rights, and saw her people\r\nbasely slain by the myrmidons of Santa Anna. The legislature of\r\nCoahuila and Texas was dispersed by the military; and, at last, the\r\nwhole republic, save the pertinacious North Americans, yielded to the\r\narmed power of the resolute oppressor.\r\n\r\nThe alarmed settlers gathered together as quickly as they could and\r\nresolved to stand by their federative rights under the charter whose\r\nguaranties allured them into Mexico. Meetings were held in all the\r\nsettlements, and a union was formed by means of correspondence. Arms\r\nwere next resorted to and the Texans were victorious at Gonzales,\r\nGoliad, Bejar, Conception, Lepantitlan, San Patricio and San Antonio.\r\nIn November they met in consultation, and in an able, resolute and\r\ndignified paper, declared that they had only taken up arms in defence\r\nof the constitution of 1824; that their object was to continue loyal\r\nto the confederacy if laws were made for the guardianship of their\r\npolitical rights, and that they offered their lives and arms in aid of\r\nother members of the republic who would rightfully rise against the\r\nmilitary despotism.\r\n\r\nBut the other states, in which there was no infusion of North Americans\r\nor Europeans, refused to second this hardy handful of pioneers. Mexico\r\nwill not do justice, in any of her commentaries on the Texan war, to the\r\nmotives of the colonists. Charging them with an original and long\r\nmeditated design to rob the republic of one of its most valuable\r\nprovinces, she forgets entirely or glosses over, the military acts of\r\nSanta Anna's invading army, in March, 1836, at the Alamo and Goliad,\r\nwhich converted resistance into revenge. After those disgraceful scenes\r\nof carnage peace was no longer possible. Santa Anna imagined, no doubt,\r\nthat he would terrify the settlers into submission if he could not drive\r\nthem from the soil. But he mistook both their fortitude and their force;\r\nand, after the fierce encounter at San Jacinto, on the 21st of April,\r\n1836, with Houston and his army, the power of Mexico over the insurgent\r\nstate was effectually and forever broken.\r\n\r\nAfter Santa Anna had been taken prisoner by the Texans, in this fatal\r\nencounter, and was released and sent home through the United States in\r\norder to fulfil his promise to secure the recognition of Texan\r\nindependence, the colonists diligently began the work of creating for\r\nthemselves a distinct nationality, for they failed in all their early\r\nattempts to incorporate themselves with the United States during the\r\nadministrations of Jackson and Van Buren. These presidents were\r\nscrupulous and faithful guardians of national honor, while they\r\nrespected the Mexican right of reconquest. Their natural sympathies\r\nwere of course yielded to Texas, but their executive duties, the faith\r\nof treaties, and the sanctions of international law forbade their\r\nacceding to the proposed union. Texas, accordingly, established a\r\nnational government, elected her officers, regulated her trade, formed\r\nher army and navy, maintained her frontier secure from assault, and\r\nwas recognized as, _de facto_, an independent sovereignty by the\r\nUnited States, England, France and Belgium. But these efforts of the\r\ninfant republic did not end in mere preparations for a separate\r\npolitical existence and future commercial wealth. The rich soil of the\r\nlowlands along the numerous rivers that veined the whole region soon\r\nattracted large accessions of immigrants, and the trade of Texas began\r\nto assume significance in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mexico busied herself, at home, in revolutions, or in\r\ngathering funds and creating armies, destined, as the authorities\r\nprofessed, to reconquer the lost province. Yet all these military and\r\nfinancial efforts were never rendered available in the field, and, in\r\nreality, no adequate force ever marched towards the frontier. The men\r\nand money raised through the services and contributions of credulous\r\ncitizens were actually designed to figure in the domestic drama of\r\npolitical power in the capital. No hostilities, of any significance,\r\noccurred between the revolutionists and the Mexicans after 1836, for\r\nwe cannot regard the Texan expedition to Santa Fé, or the Mexican\r\nassault upon the town of Mier as belligerant acts deserving\r\nconsideration as grave efforts made to assert or secure national rights.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things from 1836 until 1844, during the\r\nwhole of which period Texas exhibited to the world a far better aspect\r\nof well regulated sovereignty than Mexico herself. On the 12th of\r\nApril of that year, more than seven years after Texas had established\r\nher independence, a treaty was concluded by President Tyler with the\r\nrepresentatives of Texas for the annexation of that republic to the\r\nUnited States. In March, 1845, Congress passed a joint resolution\r\nannexing Texas to the union upon certain reasonable conditions, which\r\nwere acceded to by that nation, whose convention erected a suitable\r\nstate constitution, with which it became finally a member of our\r\nconfederacy. In the meantime, the envoys of France and England, had\r\nopened negotiations for the recognition of Texan independence, which\r\nterminated successfully; but when they announced their triumph, on the\r\n20th of May, 1845, Texas was already annexed conditionally to the\r\nUnited States by the act of congress.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution of annexation, passed by our congress, was\r\nprotested against by General Almonte, the Mexican minister at that\r\nperiod in Washington, as an act of aggression \"the most unjust which can\r\nbe found in the annals of modern history\" and designed to despoil a\r\nfriendly nation of a considerable portion of her territory. He\r\nannounced, in consequence, the termination of his mission, and demanded\r\nhis passports to leave the country. In Mexico, soon after, a bitter and\r\nbadly conducted correspondence took place between the minister of\r\nforeign affairs and Mr. Shannon, our envoy. And thus, within a brief\r\nperiod, these two nations found themselves unrepresented in each other's\r\ncapital and on the eve of a serious dispute.\r\n\r\nBut the government of the United States,--still sincerely anxious to\r\npreserve peace, or at least, willing to try every effort to soothe the\r\nirritated Mexicans and keep the discussion in the cabinet rather than\r\ntransfer it to the battle field,--determined to use the kindly efforts\r\nof our consul, Mr. Black, who still remained in the capital, to seek an\r\nopportunity for the renewal of friendly intercourse. This officer was\r\naccordingly directed to visit the minister of foreign affairs and\r\nascertain from the Mexican government whether it would receive an envoy\r\nfrom the United States, invested with full power to adjust all the\r\nquestions in dispute between the two governments. The invitation was\r\nreceived with apparent good will, and in October, 1845, the Mexican\r\ngovernment agreed to receive one, commissioned with full powers to\r\nsettle the dispute in a peaceful, reasonable and honorable manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as this intelligence reached the United States, Mr. John\r\nSlidell was dispatched as envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary on the supposed mission of peace; but when he reached\r\nVera Cruz in November, he found the aspect of affairs changed. The\r\ngovernment of Herrera, with which Mr. Black's arrangement had been\r\nmade, was tottering. General Paredes, a leader popular with the people\r\nand the army, availing himself of the general animosity against Texas,\r\nand the alleged desire of Herrera's cabinet to make peace with the\r\nUnited States, had determined to overthrow the constitutional\r\ngovernment. There is scarcely a doubt that Herrera and his ministers\r\nwere originally sincere in their desire to settle the international\r\ndifficulty, and to maintain the spirit of the contract they had made.\r\nBut the internal danger, with which they were menaced by the army and\r\nits daring demagogue, induced them to prevaricate as soon as Mr.\r\nSlidell presented his credentials for reception. All their pretexts\r\nwere, in reality, frivolous, when we consider the serious results\r\nwhich were to flow from their enunciation. The principal argument\r\nagainst the reception of our minister was, that his commission\r\nconstituted him a regular envoy, and that, he was not confined to the\r\ndiscussion of the Texan question alone. Such a mission, the\r\nauthorities alleged, placed the countries at once, diplomatically,\r\nupon an equal and ordinary footing of peace, and their objection\r\ntherefore, if it had any force, at all, was to the fact, that we\r\nexhibited through the credentials of our envoy, the strongest evidence\r\nthat one nation can give to another of perfect amity! We had, in\r\ntruth, no questions in dispute between us, except boundary and\r\nindemnity;--for Texas, as a sovereignty acknowledged by the acts, not\r\nonly of the United States and of European powers, but in consequence\r\nof her own maintenance of perfect nationality and independence, had a\r\nright to annex herself to the United States. The consent of Mexico to\r\nacknowledge her independence in 1845, under certain conditions,\r\neffectually proved this fact beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nWhilst the correspondence between Slidell and the Mexican ministry was\r\ngoing on, Paredes continued his hostile demonstrations, and, on the\r\n30th of December, 1845, president Herrera, who anxiously desired to\r\navoid bloodshed, resigned the executive chair to him without a\r\nstruggle. Feeble as was the hope of success with the new authorities,\r\nour government, still anxious to close the contest peacefully,\r\ndirected Mr. Slidell to renew the proposal for his reception to\r\nParedes. These instructions he executed on the first of March, 1846,\r\nbut his request was refused by the Mexican minister of foreign\r\naffairs, on the twelfth of that month, and our minister was forthwith\r\nobliged to return from his unsuccessful mission.\r\n\r\nAll the public documents, and addresses of Paredes, made during the\r\nearly movements of his revolution and administration, breathe the\r\ndeadliest animosity to our union. He invokes the god of battles, and\r\ncalls the world to witness the valor of Mexican arms. The revolution\r\nwhich raised him to power, was declared to be sanctioned by the\r\npeople, who were impatient for another war, in which they might avenge\r\nthe aggressions of a government that sought to prostrate them.\r\nPreparations were made for a Texan campaign. Loans were raised, and\r\nlarge bodies of troops were moved to the frontiers. General Arista,\r\nsuspected of kindness to our country, was superceded in the north by\r\nGeneral Ampudia, who arrived at Matamoros on the 11th of April, 1846,\r\nwith two hundred cavalry, followed by two thousand men to be united\r\nwith the large body of soldiery already in Matamoros.\r\n\r\nThese military demonstrations denoted the unquestionable design and\r\nwill of Paredes, who had acquired supreme power by a revolution\r\nfounded upon the solemn pledge of hostility against the United States\r\nand reconquest of Texas. His military life in Mexico made him a\r\ndespot. He had no confidence in the ability of his fellow-citizens to\r\ngovern themselves. He believed republicanism an Utopian dream of his\r\nvisionary countrymen. Free discussion through the press was\r\nprohibited, during his short rule, and his satellites advocated the\r\nestablishment of a throne to be occupied by an European prince. These\r\ncircumstances induced our government to believe, that any\r\ncounter-revolution in Mexico, which might destroy the ambitious and\r\nunpatriotic projects of Paredes, would promote the cause of peace, and\r\naccordingly, it saw with pleasure, the prospect of a new outbreak\r\nwhich might result in the downfall, and total destruction of the\r\ngreatest enemy we possessed on the soil of our sister republic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Signature--Ant.

He, accordingly left his encampment on the 8th of\r\nMarch, and, on the 25th, reached Point Isabel, having encountered no\r\nserious opposition on the way. The march to the Rio Grande has been\r\nmade the subject of complaint by politicians in Mexico and the United\r\nStates, who believed that the territory lying between that river and\r\nthe Nueces, was not the property of Texas. But inasmuch as Mexico\r\nstill continued vehemently to assert her political right over _the\r\nwhole of Texas_, the occupation of any part of its soil, south of the\r\nSabine, by American troops, was in that aspect of the case, quite as\r\nmuch an infringement of Mexican sovereignty, as the march of our\r\ntroops, from the Nueces to the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nAs it is important that the reader should understand the original\r\ntitle to Louisiana, under which the boundary of the Rio Grande, was\r\nclaimed, first of all for that state, and, subsequently, for Texas, we\r\nshall relate its history in a summary manner.\r\n\r\nLouisiana had been the property of France, and by a secret contract\r\nbetween that country and Spain in 1762, as well as by treaties between\r\nFrance, Spain, and England, in the following year, the French dominion\r\nwas extinguished on the continent of America. In consequence of the\r\ntreaty between this country and England in 1783, the Mississippi\r\nbecame the western boundary of the United States, from its source to\r\nthe thirty-first degree of north latitude, and thence, on the same\r\nparallel, to the St. Mary's. France, it will be remembered, had always\r\nclaimed dominion in Louisiana to the Rio Bravo del Norte, or Rio\r\nGrande; by virtue:--\r\n\r\n1st. Of the discovery of the Mississippi from near its source to the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n2d. Of the possession taken, and establishment made by La Salle, at\r\nthe bay of Saint Bernard, west of the river Trinity and Colorado, by\r\nauthority of Louis XIV. in 1635--notwithstanding the subsequent\r\ndestruction of the colony.\r\n\r\n3d. Of the charter of Louis XIV. to Crozat in 1712.\r\n\r\n4th. Of the historical authority of Du Pratz, Champigny and the Count\r\nde Vergennes.\r\n\r\n5th. Of the authority of De Lisle's map, and of the map published in\r\n1762, by Don Thomas Lopez, Geographer to the king of Spain, as well as\r\nof various other maps, atlases, and geographical authorities.\r\n\r\nBy an article of the secret treaty of San Ildefonso in October, 1800,\r\nSpain retroceded Louisiana to France, but this treaty was not\r\npromulgated until the beginning of 1802. The paragraph of cession is\r\nas follows: \"His Catholic majesty engages to retrocede to the French\r\nrepublic, six months after the full and entire execution of the\r\nconditions and stipulations above recited, relative to his royal\r\nhighness the Duke of Parma, the colony and province of Louisiana, with\r\nthe same extent that it already has in the hands of Spain, _and that\r\nit had when France possessed it_, and, such as it should be, after the\r\ntreaties passed subsequently between Spain and other powers.\" In 1803,\r\nBonaparte, the first consul of the French republic, ceded Louisiana to\r\nthe United States, as fully, and in the same manner, as it had been\r\nretroceded to France by Spain, under the treaty of San Ildefonso; and,\r\nby virtue of this grant, Messrs. Madison, Monroe, Adams, Clay, Van\r\nBuren, Jackson, and Polk, contended that the original limit of the new\r\nstate had been the Rio Grande. However, by the third article of our\r\ntreaty with Spain, in 1819, all our pretensions to extend the\r\nterritory of Louisiana towards Mexico on the Rio Grande, were\r\nabandoned by adopting the river Sabine as our boundary in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican authorities upon this subject are either silent or\r\ndoubtful. No light is to be gathered from the geographical researches\r\nof Humboldt, whose elucidations of New Spain are in many respects the\r\nfullest and most satisfactory. In the year 1835, Stephen Austin\r\npublished a map of Texas, representing the Nueces as the western\r\nconfine,--and in 1836, General Almonte the former minister from\r\nMexico to the United States, published a memoir upon Texas in which,\r\nwhilst describing the Texan department of Bejar, he says--\"That\r\nnotwithstanding it has been hitherto believed that the Rio de las\r\nNueces is the dividing line of Coahuila and Texas, inasmuch as it is\r\nalways thus represented on maps, I am informed by the government of\r\nthe state, that geographers have been in error upon this subject; and\r\nthat the true line should commence at the mouth of the river Aransaso,\r\nand follow it to its source; thence, it should continue by a straight\r\nline until it strikes the junction of the rivers Medina and San\r\nAntonio, and then, pursuing the east bank of the Medina to its head\r\nwaters, it should terminate on the confines of Chihuahua.\"[67]\r\n\r\nThe true origin of the Mexican war was not this march of Taylor and\r\nhis troops from the Nueces to the Rio Grande, through the debatable\r\nland. The American and Mexican troops were brought face to face by the\r\nact, and _hostilities_ were the natural result after the exciting\r\nannoyances upon the part of the Mexican government which followed the\r\nunion of Texas with our confederacy. Besides this, General Paredes,\r\nthe usurping president, had already declared in Mexico, on the _18th\r\nof April, 1846_, in a letter addressed to the commanding officer on\r\nthe northern frontier, that he supposed him at the head of a valiant\r\narmy on the theatre of action;--and that it was indispensable to\r\ncommence hostilities, _the Mexicans themselves taking the initiative_!\r\n\r\nWe believe that our nation and its rulers earnestly desired honorable\r\npeace, though they did not shun the alternative of war. It was\r\nimpossible to permit a conterminous neighbor who owed us large sums of\r\nmoney, and was hostile to the newly adopted state, to select unopposed\r\nher mode and moment of attack. Mexico would neither resign her\r\npretensions upon Texas, negotiate, receive our minister, nor remain at\r\npeace. She would neither declare war, nor cultivate friendship, and\r\nthe result was, that when the armies approached each other, but little\r\ntime was lost in resorting to the cannon and the sword.\r\n\r\nAs soon as General Taylor reached the Rio Grande he left a command at\r\nthe mouth of the river, and taking post opposite Matamoros erected a\r\nfort, the guns of which bore directly upon the city. The Mexicans,\r\nwhose artillery might have been brought to play upon the works, from\r\nthe opposite side of the river, made no hostile demonstration against\r\nthe left bank for some time, nor did they interrupt the construction\r\nof the fort. Reinforcements, however, were constantly arriving in\r\nthe city. Ampudia and Arista were there. Interviews were held between\r\nthe Mexican authorities and our officers, in which the latter were\r\nordered to retire from the soil it was alleged they were usurping. But\r\nas this was a diplomatic, and not a military question, General Taylor\r\nresolved to continue in position, though his forces were perhaps\r\ninadequate to contend with the augmenting numbers of the foe. He\r\nexamined the country thoroughly by his scouting parties and pushed his\r\nreconnoissances, on the left bank, from Point Isabel to some distance\r\nbeyond his encampment opposite Matamoros. Whilst engaged in this\r\nservice, some of his officers and men were captured or killed by the\r\n_ranchero_ cavalry of the enemy; and, on the 24th of April, Captain\r\nThornton who had been sent to observe the country above the encampment\r\nwith sixty-three dragoons, fell into an ambuscade, out of which they\r\nendeavored to cut their way, but were forced to surrender with a loss\r\nof sixteen killed and wounded. This was the first blood spilled in\r\nactual conflict.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATAMOROS.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the United States, the news of Taylor's supposed danger,\r\ngreatly exaggerated by rumor, was spread far and wide. An actual war\r\nhad, perhaps, not been seriously apprehended. Taylor had been\r\nexpressly commanded to refrain from aggression. It was supposed that\r\nthe mere presence of our troops on the frontier would preserve Texas\r\nfrom invasion, and that negotiations would ultimately terminate the\r\ndispute. This is the only ground upon which we can reasonably account\r\nfor the apparent carelessness of our government in not placing a force\r\nupon the Rio Grande, adequate to encounter all the opposing array.\r\nCongress was in session when the news reached Washington. The\r\npresident immediately announced the fact, and, on the 13th of May,\r\n1846, ten millions of dollars were appropriated to carry on the war,\r\nand fifty thousand volunteers were ordered to be raised. An \"ARMY OF\r\nTHE WEST\" was directed to be formed under the command of Kearney, at\r\nfort Leavenworth, on the Missouri, which was to cross the country to\r\nthe Pacific, after capturing New Mexico. An \"ARMY OF THE CENTRE,\"\r\nunder General Wool, was to assemble at San Antonio de Bejar whence it\r\nwas to march upon Coahuila and Chihuahua, and, whilst the heart and\r\nthe west of Mexico were penetrated by these officers, it was designed\r\nthat Taylor should make war on the northern and eastern states of the\r\nMexican republic. In addition to these orders to the army, the naval\r\nforces, under Commodores Stockton and Sloat in the Pacific, and\r\nCommodore Conner, in the Gulf of Mexico, were commanded to co-operate\r\nwith our land forces, to harass the enemy, and to aid, with all their\r\npower, in the subjugation and capture of Mexican property and territory.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Thornton's surrender, General Taylor, availing\r\nhimself of authority with which he had been invested to call upon the\r\ngovernors of Louisiana and Texas for military aid, demanded four\r\nregiments of volunteers from each state, for the country in the\r\nneighborhood of the Rio Grande was alive with belligerant Mexicans. He\r\nthen visited the fortifications opposite Matamoros, and finding the\r\ngarrison but scantly supplied with provisions, hastened back to Point\r\nIsabel with a formidable escort, and obtaining the requisite rations,\r\ncommenced his march back to Matamoros and the fort on the 7th of May.\r\nBut, in the interval, General Arista, had crossed the Rio Grande with\r\nhis forces, and on the 8th, our General encountered him, drawn up in\r\nbattle array at Palo Alto and ready to dispute his passage along the\r\nroad. A sharp engagement ensued between the two armies from two\r\no'clock in the afternoon until nearly dark, when the Mexicans withdrew\r\nfrom the action for the night. Our total force in this affair,\r\naccording to official reports, was two thousand two hundred and\r\neighty-eight, while that of Mexico, according to the admission of the\r\nofficers, amounted to six thousand regulars with a large and probably\r\nundisciplined force drawn, at random, from the country.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 8th was passed with some anxiety in the American camp,\r\nfor the fierce conflict of the day induced many prudent officers to\r\nbelieve it best either to return to Point Isabel or await reinforcements\r\nbefore again giving battle to the enemy. General Taylor heard and\r\nweighed the opinions of his most reliable officers, but, after due\r\nreflection, determined to advance. The condition of the fort opposite\r\nMatamoros demanded his urgent aid. The moral effect of a retreat would\r\nbe great, at the commencement of a war, both on Mexico and our own\r\ntroops; and, moreover, he had perfect confidence in the disciplined\r\nregulars who sustained so nobly the brunt of the first battle.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the troops were advanced early on the 9th, for they found,\r\nat day dawn, that the Mexicans had abandoned Palo Alto for a stronger\r\nposition nearer the centre of action and interest at Matamoros. After\r\nadvancing cautiously, in readiness for immediate battle, our men came\r\nup with the Mexicans, in the Resaca de la Palma, or as it is properly\r\ncalled La Resaca del Guerrero,--the \"Ravine of the Warrior,\" which\r\nafforded them a natural defence against our approach along the road.\r\nThe ravine, curved across the highway and was flanked by masses of\r\nprickly plants aloes, and undergrowth, matted into impenetrable\r\nthickets, known in Mexico as _chapparal_. The action was begun by the\r\ninfantry in skirmishes with the foe, and after the centre of the\r\nposition on the road had been severely harassed and damaged by our\r\nflying artillery, a gallant charge of the dragoons broke the Mexican\r\nlines and opened a pathway to Matamoros. The engagement lasted a short\r\ntime after this combined movement of artillery and cavalry, but,\r\nbefore night fall the enemy was in full flight to the river and our\r\ngarrison at the fort joyously relieved. In the interval, this position\r\nhad been bombarded and cannonaded by the Mexicans from the opposite\r\nside of the river, and its commanding officer slain. In memory of his\r\nvaliant defence, the place has been honored with the name of Fort Brown.\r\n\r\nAfter General Taylor had occupied Matamoros on the 18th of May,--and\r\nhe was only prevented from capturing it and all the Mexican forces and\r\nammunition on the night of the 9th by the want of a ponton train,\r\nwhich he had vainly demanded,--he established his base line for future\r\noperations in the interior, along the Rio Grande, extending several\r\nhundred miles near that stream. His task of organizing, accepting, or\r\nrejecting the multitudes of recruits who flocked to his standard, was\r\nnot only oppressive but difficult, for he found it hard to disappoint\r\nthe patriotic fervor of hundreds who were anxious to engage in the\r\nwar. The Quatermaster's department, too, was one of incessant toil and\r\nanxiety; because, called unexpectedly and for the first time into\r\nactive service in the field, it was comparatively unprepared to answer\r\nthe multitude of requisitions that were daily made upon it by the\r\ngovernment, the general officers, and the recruits. The whole material\r\nof a campaign was to be rapidly created. Money was to be raised;\r\nsteamers bought; ships chartered; wagons built and transported; levies\r\nbrought to the field of action; munitions of war and provisions\r\ndistributed over the whole vast territory which it was designed to\r\noccupy! Whilst these things were going on, the country, at home, was\r\nripe, and most eager for action.\r\n\r\nNor was our government inattentive to the internal politics of Mexico.\r\nIt perceived at once that there was no hope of effecting a peace with\r\nthe administration of Paredes, whose bitter hostility was of course,\r\nnot mitigated by the first successes of our arms. Santa Anna, it will\r\nbe recollected had left Mexico after the amnesty in 1845, and it was\r\nknown there was open hostility between him and Paredes who had\r\ncontributed so greatly to his downfall. Information was, moreover,\r\nreceived from reliable sources in Washington, that a desire prevailed\r\nin the republic to recall the banished chief and to seat him once more\r\nin the presidential chair; and, at the same time, there was cause to\r\nbelieve that if he again obtained supreme power he would not be averse\r\nto accommodate matters upon a satisfactory basis between the\r\ncountries. Orders were, accordingly issued to Commodore Conner, who\r\ncommanded the home squadron in the gulf, to offer no impediment if\r\nSanta Anna approached the coast with a design of entering Mexico. The\r\nexiled president was duly apprised of these facts, and when the\r\nrevolution actually occurred in his favor in the following summer and\r\nhis rival fell from power, he availed himself of the order to pass the\r\nlines of the blockading squadron at Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nAfter General Taylor had completely made his preparations to advance\r\ninto the interior along his base on the Rio Grande, he moved forward\r\ngradually, capturing and garrisoning all the important posts along the\r\nriver. At length the main body of the army, under Worth and Taylor\r\nreached the neighborhood of Monterey, the capital of the state of New\r\nLeon, situated at the foot of the Sierra Madre on a plain, but in a\r\nposition which would enable it to make a stout resistance, especially\r\nas it was understood that the Mexican army had gathered itself up in\r\nthis stronghold, which was the key of the northern provinces and on\r\nthe main highway to the interior, in order to strike a death blow at\r\nthe invaders. On the 5th of September, the divisions concentrated at\r\nMarin, and on the 9th they advanced to the Walnut Springs, which\r\nafterwards became, for so long a period, the headquarters of the\r\ngallant \"ARMY OF OCCUPATION.\"\r\n\r\nReconnoissances of the adjacent country were immediately made and it\r\nwas resolved to attack the city by a bold movement towards its\r\nsouthern side that would cut off its communications through the gap in\r\nthe mountains by which the road led to Saltillo. Accordingly General\r\nWorth was detached on this difficult but honorable service with a\r\nstrong and reliable corps, and, after excessive toil, hard fighting\r\nand wonderful endurance upon the part of our men, the desired object\r\nwas successfully gained. An unfinished and fortified edifice called\r\nthe Bishop's Palace, on the summit of a steep hill was stormed and\r\ntaken, and thus an important vantage ground, commanding the city by a\r\nplunging shot, was secured.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Taylor seeking to withdraw or distract the enemy\r\nfrom his designs on the southern and western sides of the city, made a\r\nmovement under General Butler, of Kentucky, upon its northern front.\r\nWhat was probably designed only as a feint soon became a severe and\r\ndeadly conflict. Our men,--especially the volunteers,--eager to flesh\r\ntheir swords in the first conflict with which the war indulged them,\r\nrushed into the city, which seems to have been amply prepared, in that\r\nquarter, with barricades, forts, loop-holes, and every means of\r\ndefence suitable for the narrow streets and flat roofed and parapeted\r\nhouses of a Spanish town. After the first deadly onset there was, of\r\ncourse, no intention or desire to abandon the conflict, fatal as its\r\nprosecution might ultimately become. On they fought from street to\r\nstreet, and house to house, and yard to yard, until night closed over\r\nthe dying and the dead. On the second day a different system of\r\napproach was adopted. Instead of risking life in the street which was\r\nraked from end to end by artillery, or rendered untenable by the\r\nhidden marksmen who shot our men from behind the walls of the house\r\ntops, our forces were thrown into the dwellings, and breaking onward\r\nthrough walls and enclosures, gradually mined their way towards the\r\nplaza or great square of Monterey.\r\n\r\nThus, both divisions under the eyes of Worth, Butler and Taylor,\r\nsuccessfully performed their assigned tasks, until it became evident\r\nto the Mexicans that their town must fall, and, that if finally taken\r\nby the sword, it would be given up to utter destruction and pillage. A\r\ncapitulation was therefore proposed by Ampudia who stipulated for the\r\nwithdrawal of his forces and an armistice. Our force was in no\r\ncondition to seize, hold, and support a large body of prisoners of\r\nwar, nor was it prepared immediately to follow up the victory by\r\npenetrating the interior. General Taylor, who was resolved not to shed\r\na single drop of needless blood in the campaign, granted the terms;\r\nand, thus, this strong position, garrisoned by nearly ten thousand\r\ntroops, sustained by more than forty pieces of artillery, yielded to\r\nour army of seven thousand, unsupported by a battering train and\r\nwinning the day by hard fighting alone. The attack began on the 21st\r\nof September, continued during the two following days, and the\r\ngarrison capitulated on the 24th. This capitulation and armistice were\r\nassented to by our commander after mature consultation and approval of\r\nhis principal officers. The Mexicans informed him, that Paredes had\r\nbeen deposed,--that Santa Anna was in power, and that peace would soon\r\nbe made; but the authorities, at home, eager for fresh victories, or\r\npandering to public and political taste, did not approve and confirm\r\nan act, for which General Taylor has, nevertheless received, as he\r\ntruly merits, the just applause of impartial history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Memorias para la historia de la Guerra de Tejas, vol.\r\nii, p. 543.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1846-1847.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL WOOL INSPECTS AND MUSTERS THE WESTERN TROOPS.--ARMY OF THE\r\n    CENTRE.--NEW MEXICO--KEARNEY--MACNAMARA--CALIFORNIA.--FRÉMONT--\r\n    SONOMA--CALIFORNIAN INDEPENDENCE--POSSESSION TAKEN.--SLOAT--\r\n    STOCKTON.--A REVOLT--PICO--TREATY OF COUENGA.--KEARNEY AT SAN\r\n    PASCUAL--IS RELIEVED--DISPUTES--SAN GABRIELLE--MESA--LOS\r\n    ANGELES.--FRÉMONT'S CHARACTER, SERVICES, TRIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Wool, who had been for a long period inspector general of the\r\nUnited States army, was entrusted with the difficult task of examining\r\nthe recruits in the west, and set forth on his journey after receiving\r\nhis orders on the 29th of May, 1846. He traversed the states of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi, and, in\r\nsomewhat less than two months, had journeyed three thousand miles and\r\nmustered twelve thousand men into service. This expedition of a hardy\r\nsoldier exhibits, at once, the powers of a competent American officer,\r\nand the facility with which an efficient _corps d'armée_, may at any\r\nurgent moment, be raised in our country.\r\n\r\nNearly nine thousand of these recruits were sent to Taylor on the Rio\r\nGrande, while those who were destined for the \"Army of the Centre,\"\r\nrendezvoused at Bejar, in Texas. At this place their commander Wool\r\njoined them, and commenced the rigid system of discipline, under\r\naccomplished officers, which made his division a model in the army. He\r\nmarched from Bejar with five hundred regulars and two thousand four\r\nhundred and fifty volunteers, on the 20th of September, and passed\r\nonwards through Presidio, Nava, and across the Sierra of San José and\r\nSanta Rosa, and the rivers Alamos, Sabine, and del Norte, until he\r\nreached Monclova. He had been directed to advance to Chihuahua, but as\r\nthis place was in a great measure controlled by the states of New Leon\r\nand Coahuila which were already in our possession, he desisted from\r\npursuing his march thither, and, after communicating with General\r\nTaylor and learning the fall of Monterey, he pushed on to the fertile\r\nregion of Parras and thence to the headquarters of General Taylor, in\r\nthe month of December, as soon as he was apprised of the danger which\r\nmenaced him at that period.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that it was part of our government's original plan\r\nto reduce New Mexico and California,--a task which was imposed upon\r\nColonel Kearney, a hardy frontier fighter, long used to Indian character\r\nand Indian warfare--who, upon being honored with the command was raised\r\nto the rank of Brigadier General. This officer moved from Fort\r\nLeavenworth on the 30th of June, towards Santa Fé, the capital of New\r\nMexico, with an army of sixteen hundred men, and after an unresisted\r\nmarch of eight hundred and seventy-three miles, he reached his\r\ndestination on the 18th of August. Possession of the place was given\r\nwithout a blow, and it is probable that the discreet Armijo yielded to\r\nthe advice of American counsellors in his capital, in surrendering\r\nwithout bloodshed to our forces. Kearney had been authorized to organize\r\nand muster into service a battalion of emigrants to Oregon and\r\nCalifornia, who eagerly availed themselves of this favorable military\r\nopportunity to reach their distant abodes on the shores of the Pacific.\r\nAfter organizing the new government of Santa Fé, forming a new code of\r\norganic laws, and satisfying himself of the stability of affairs in that\r\nquarter, Kearney departed on his mission to California. But he had not\r\ngone far when he was met by an express with information of the fall of\r\nthat portion of Mexico, and immediately sent back the main body of his\r\nmen, continuing his route through the wilderness with the escort of one\r\nhundred dragoons alone. In September of this year, a regiment of New\r\nYork volunteer infantry had been despatched thither also, by sea, under\r\nthe command of Colonel Stevenson.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence in existence that shortly before the commencement of\r\nthis war, it had been contemplated to place a large portion of the\r\nmost valuable districts of California, indirectly, under British\r\nprotection, by grants to an Irish Catholic clergyman named Macnamara,\r\nwho projected a colony of his countrymen in those regions. He excited\r\nthe Mexicans to accede to his proposal by appeals to their religious\r\nprejudices against the Protestants of the north, who, he alleged,\r\nwould seize the jewel unless California was settled by his countrymen\r\nwhose creed would naturally unite them with the people and\r\ninstitutions of Mexico. \"Within a year, he declared, California would\r\nbecome a part of the American nation; and, inundated by cruel\r\ninvaders, their Catholic institutions would be the prey of Methodist\r\nwolves.\" The government of Mexico granted three thousand square\r\nleagues in the rich valley of San Joaquin, embracing San Francisco,\r\nMonterey, and Santa Barbara, to this behest of the foreign priest; but\r\nhis patent could not be perfected until the governor of California\r\nsanctioned his permanent tenure of the land.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1845, Lieutenant Gillespie was despatched from Washington\r\nwith verbal instructions to Captain Frémont who had been pursuing his\r\nscientific examinations of California, and had been inhospitably\r\nordered by the authorities to quit the country. Early in March of\r\n1846, the bold explorer was within the boundaries of Oregon, where he\r\nwas found, in the following May, by Gillespie, who delivered him his\r\nverbal orders and a letter of credence from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this message, Frémont abandoned his camp in the\r\nforest, surrounded by hostile Indians, and moved south to the valley\r\nof the Sacramento, where he was at once hailed by the American\r\nsettlers, who, together with the foreigners generally, had received\r\norders from the Mexican General Castro, to leave California. Frémont's\r\nsmall band immediately formed the nucleus of a revolutionary troop,\r\nwhich gathered in numbers as it advanced south, and abstaining\r\nguardedly from acts which might disgust the people, they injured no\r\nindividuals and violated no private property. On the 14th of June,\r\nSonoma was taken possession of, and was garrisoned by a small force,\r\nunder Mr. Ide, who issued a proclamation, inviting all to come to his\r\ncamp and aid in forming a republican government. Coure and Fowler, two\r\nyoung Americans, were murdered about this period in the neighborhood,\r\nand others were taken prisoners under Padilla. But the belligerants\r\nwere pursued to San Raphael by Captain Ford, where they were conquered\r\nby the Americans; and, on the 25th of June, Frémont, who heard that\r\nCastro was approaching with two hundred men, joined the camp at\r\nSonoma. Thus far, every thing had been conducted with justice and\r\nliberality by our men. They studiously avoided disorderly conduct or\r\ncaptures, and invariably promised payment for the supplies that were\r\ntaken for the support of the troopers. The Californians were in\r\nreality gratified by the prospect of American success in their\r\nterritory, for they believed that it would secure a stable and\r\nprogressive government, under which, that beautiful region would be\r\ngradually developed.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July, the Californian Americans declared their\r\nindependence, and organizing a battalion, of which Frémont was the\r\nchief, they raised the standard of the Bear and Star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTEREY.]\r\n\r\nFrémont, at the head of his new battalion, moved his camp to Sutter's\r\nFort on the Sacramento and whilst he was preparing, in July, to follow\r\nGeneral Castro to Santa Clara, he received the joyful news that\r\nCommodore Sloat had raised the American flag on the 7th of the month\r\nat Monterey, and that war actually existed between Mexico and the\r\nUnited States. The Californian Americans of course immediately\r\nabandoned their revolution for the national war, and substituted the\r\nAmerican ensign for the grisly emblem under which they designed\r\nconquering the territory.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July, Commander Montgomery took possession of San\r\nFrancisco, and soon after, Frémont joined Commodore Sloat at Monterey.\r\nSloat, who had in reality acted upon the faith of Frémont's operations\r\nin the north, knowing that Gillespie had been sent to him as a special\r\nmessenger, and having heard, whilst at Mazatlan, of the warlike\r\nmovements on the Rio Grande, was rather fearful that he had been\r\nprecipitate in his conduct; but he resolved to maintain what he had\r\ndone; and accordingly, when admiral Sir George Seymour, arrived in the\r\nCollingwood at Monterey, on the 6th of July, the grants to the Irish\r\nclergyman were not completed, and the American flag was already\r\nfloating on every important post in the north of California. Seymour\r\ntook Macnamara on board his ship, and thus the hopes of the British\r\npartizans were effectually blighted when the Admiral and his passenger\r\nsailed from the coast.\r\n\r\nCommodore Stockton arrived at Monterey during this summer and Sloat\r\nreturned to the United States, leaving the Commodore in command.\r\nFrémont and Gillespie, who were at the head of forces on shore\r\ndetermined to act under the orders of the naval commander, and\r\nStockton immediately prepared for a military movement against the city\r\nof Los Angeles, where, he learned, that General Castro and the civil\r\ngovernor Pico had assembled six hundred men. Frémont and the\r\nCommodore, embarking their forces at Monterey, sailed for San Pedro\r\nand San Diego, where, landing their troops, they united and took\r\npossession of Los Angeles on the 13th of August. The public buildings,\r\narchives and property fell into their possession without bloodshed,\r\nfor Castro, the commanding general, fled at their approach. Stockton\r\nissued a proclamation announcing these facts to the people on the 17th\r\nof August, and having instituted a government, directed elections, and\r\nrequired an oath of allegiance from the military. He appointed\r\nFrémont, military commandant and Gillespie, secretary. On the 28th of\r\nAugust he reported these proceedings to the government at Washington,\r\nby the messenger who was met by General Kearney, as we have already\r\nrelated, on his way from Santa Fé to the Pacific. Carson, the courier,\r\napprised the General of the conquest of California, and was obliged\r\nby him to return as his guide, whilst a new messenger was despatched\r\ntowards the east, with the missives, escorted by the residue of the\r\ntroop which was deemed useless for further military efforts on the\r\nshores of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBut before Kearney reached his destination, a change had come over\r\naffairs in California. Castro returned to the charge in September with\r\na large Mexican force headed by General Flores, and the town of Los\r\nAngeles and the surrounding country having revolted, expelled the\r\nAmerican garrison. Four hundred marines who landed from the Savannah\r\nunder Captain Mervine, were repulsed, while the garrison of Santa\r\nBarbara, under Lieutenant Talbott had retired before a large body of\r\nCalifornians and Mexicans. Frémont, immediately resolving to increase\r\nhis battalion, raised four hundred and twenty-eight men, chiefly from\r\nthe emigrants who moved this year to California. He mounted his\r\ntroopers on horses procured in the vicinity of San Francisco and\r\nSutter's Fort, and marched secretly but quickly to San Luis Obispo,\r\nwhere he surprised and captured Don Jesus Pico, the commandant of that\r\nmilitary post. Pico having been found in arms had broken his parole,\r\ngiven during the early pacification, and a court-martial sentenced him\r\nto be shot; but Frémont, still steadily pursuing his humane policy\r\ntowards the Californians, pardoned the popular and influential\r\nchieftain, who, from that hour, was his firm friend throughout the\r\nsubsequent troubles.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas day of 1846, amid storm and rain, in which a hundred\r\nhorses and mules perished, Frémont and his brave battalion passed the\r\nmountain of Santa Barbara. Skirting the coast through the long\r\nmaritime pass at Punto Gordo,--protected on one flank by one of the\r\nvessels of the navy, and assailed, on the other, by fierce bands of\r\nmounted Californians,--they moved onward until they reached the plain\r\nof Couenga where the enemy was drawn up with a force equal to their\r\nown. Frémont summoned the hostile troops to surrender, and after their\r\nconsent to a parley, went to them with Don Jesus Pico and arranged the\r\nterms of the capitulation, by which they bound themselves to deliver\r\ntheir arms to our soldiers and to conform, at home, to the laws of the\r\nUnited States, though no Californians should be compelled to take an\r\noath of allegiance to the United States, until the war was ended and\r\nthe treaty either exonerated them or changed their nationality.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General Kearney, on his westward march from Santa Fé, had\r\nreached a place called Warner's _Rancho_, thirty-three miles from San\r\nDiego, where a captured Californian mail for Sonoma apprised him that\r\nthe southern part of the territory was wrested from our troops. The\r\nletters exulted over our discomfiture, but it was supposed that, as\r\nusual in Mexico, they exaggerated the misfortune of the Americans.\r\nKearney's small troop was much enfeebled by the long and fatiguing\r\njourney it had made from Santa Fé amid great privations. From Warner's\r\nRancho the commander communicated with Stockton by means of a neutral\r\nEnglishman, and, on the 5th of December, was joined by Gillespie, who\r\ninformed him, that a mounted Californian force, under Andres Pico, was\r\nprepared to dispute his passage towards the coast. On the 6th the\r\nAmericans left the _rancho_, resolving to come suddenly upon the\r\nenemy, and confident that the usual success of our troops would attend\r\nthe exploit;--but the fresh forces of this hardy and brave Californian\r\nband, composed perhaps, of some of the most expert horsemen in that\r\nregion, were far more than a match for the toil-worn troopers of\r\nKearney. Eighteen of our men were killed in this action at San\r\nPascual, and thirteen wounded. For several days the camp of the\r\nAmericans was besieged by the fierce and hardy children of the soil.\r\nThe provisions of the beleagured band were scant, and it was almost\r\nentirely deprived of water. Its position was, in every respect, most\r\ndisastrous, and, in all probability, it would have perished from\r\nfamine or fallen an easy prey to the Mexicans, had not the resolute\r\nCarson, accompanied by Lieutenant Beale and an Indian, volunteered to\r\npass the dangerous lines of the enemy to seek assistance at San Diego.\r\nThese heroic men performed their perilous duty, and Lieutenant Grey,\r\nwith a hundred and eighty soldiers and marines, reached and relieved\r\nhis anxious countrymen on the 10th of December, bringing them, in two\r\ndays, to the American camp at San Diego.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the band had recruited its strength, Kearney naturally\r\nbecame anxious to engage in active service. He had been sent to\r\nCalifornia, according to the language of his instructions, to conquer\r\nand govern it; but he found Commodore Stockton already in the position\r\nof governor, with an ample naval force at his orders, whilst the\r\nbroken remnant of the dragoons who accompanied him from Santa Fé, was\r\naltogether incompetent to subdue the revolted territory. By himself\r\ntherefore, he was altogether inadequate for any successful military\r\nmove. Stockton, quite as anxious as Kearney to engage in active\r\nhostilities, was desirous to accompany the general as his aid; but\r\nKearney declined the service, and, in turn, volunteered to become the\r\naid of Stockton. The commodore, less accustomed, perhaps, to military\r\netiquette than to prompt and useful action at a moment of difficulty,\r\nresolved at once to end the game of idle compliments, and accepted the\r\noffer of General Kearney; but, before they departed, Stockton agreed\r\nthat he might command the expedition in a position subordinate to him\r\nas commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, with sixty volunteers, four hundred marines,\r\nsix heavy pieces of artillery, eleven heavy wagons, and fifty-seven\r\ndragoons composing the remains of General Kearney's troop, they\r\nmarched towards the north, and, on the 7th of January, found\r\nthemselves near the river San Gabrielle, the passage of which the\r\nenemy, with superior numbers under General Flores, was prepared to\r\ndispute. It was a contest between American sailors and soldiers, and\r\nCalifornia horsemen, for the whole Mexican troop was mounted; yet the\r\nAmericans were successful and crossed the river. This action occurred\r\nabout nine miles from Los Angeles, and our men pushed on six miles\r\nfurther, till they reached the Mesa, a level prairie, where Flores\r\nagain attacked them and was beaten off. Retreating thence to Couenga,\r\nthe Californians, refusing to submit to Stockton and Kearney,\r\ncapitulated, as we have already declared to Colonel Frémont, who had\r\nbeen raised to this rank by our government. On the morning of the 10th\r\nof January, 1847, the Americans took final possession of Los Angeles.\r\nSoon after this a government was established for California, which was\r\nto continue until the close of the war or until the government or the\r\npopulation of the region changed it.\r\n\r\nThe disputes which arose between Stockton, Kearney, and Frémont, as to\r\nthe right to command in California, under the orders from their\r\nrespective departments, are matters rather of private and personal\r\ninterest than of such public concern as would entitle them to be\r\nminutely recounted in this brief sketch of the Mexican war. It is\r\nimpossible to present a faithful idea of the controversy and its\r\nmerits without entering into a detail of all the circumstances, but\r\nfor this, we have no space, in the present history. Strict military\r\netiquette appears to have demanded of Kearney, immediately upon his\r\narrival, the assertion of his right to command as a general officer\r\noperating in the interior of the country. This was a question solely\r\nbetween Stockton and himself, in which Frémont, a subordinate officer,\r\nrecently transplanted from the Topographical corps into the regular\r\narmy as a Colonel, had of course, no interest save that of duty.\r\nNevertheless he became involved in the controversy between the\r\nclaimants, and although raised to the rank of Governor of California,\r\nby Commodore Stockton, he was deprived of his authority when General\r\nKearney subsequently assumed that station. The disputes between the\r\nCommodore and the General seem to have arisen under the somewhat\r\nconflicting instructions of the War and Navy Departments, and were\r\ncalculated, as distinguished officers afterwards declared officially,\r\nto \"embarrass the mind, and to excite the doubts of officers of\r\ngreater experience\" than the Colonel.\r\n\r\nAlthough Frémont's services were lost for a while on the shores of the\r\nPacific, he was not forgotten either there, or at home. What he had\r\ndone for his country in that remote region by exploring its solitudes\r\nwith his hardy band; what he added to geographical and general\r\nscience; what regions he almost revealed to American pioneers; what\r\nservices he rendered in securing a happy issue to the war in\r\nCalifornia--have all been recollected with gratitude and rewarded with\r\nthe virgin honors of the new born State. But, at that time, this\r\nbrilliant officer who combined the science of Humboldt with the energy\r\nand more than the generosity of Cortéz, was doomed to suffer more than\r\nthe temporary deprivation of power. After the war was in reality over,\r\nafter Commodore Stockton had departed and General Kearney had assumed\r\nthe governorship which was subsequently given to Colonel\r\nMason--Frémont was refused permission to continue his scientific\r\npursuits in California or to join his regiment on the active fields of\r\nMexico. When General Kearney turned his face homewards, towards the\r\nclose of the spring of 1847, Frémont was ordered to follow in his\r\ntrain across the mountains, and was finally arrested at Fort\r\nLeavenworth, on the borders of civilization. During the next winter he\r\nwas tried by a Court Martial on charges of mutiny, disobedience, and\r\nconduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, and\r\nbeing found guilty was sentenced to be dismissed the service. A\r\nmajority of the court, however, considering all the circumstances of\r\nthe case, recommended him to the lenient judgment of the President,\r\nwho not being satisfied that the facts proved the military crime of\r\nmutiny--though he sustained the court's opinion otherwise--and\r\nrecognizing Frémont's previous meritorious and valuable services,\r\nreleased him from arrest, restored his sword and ordered him to report\r\nfor duty. But Frémont, feeling unconscious, as he declared, of having\r\ndone any thing to merit the finding of the court, declined the offered\r\nrestoration to the service, as he could not, \"by accepting the\r\nclemency of the President, admit the justice of the decision against\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n    VALLEY OF THE RIO GRANDE.--SANTA ANNA AT SAN LUIS.--SCOTT\r\n    COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.--PLAN OF ATTACK ON THE EAST COAST.--GENERAL\r\n    SCOTT'S PLAN.--DONIPHAN'S EXPEDITION.--BRACITO--SACRAMENTO.--\r\n    REVOLT IN NEW MEXICO.--MURDER OF RICHIE.--SELECTION OF BATTLE\r\n    GROUND--DESCRIPTION OF IT.--BATTLE OF ANGOSTURA OR BUENA\r\n    VISTA.--MEXICAN RETREAT--TOBASCO--TAMPICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe return from the theatre of these military operations on the shores\r\nof the Pacific, to the valley of the Rio Grande and the headquarters\r\nof General Taylor. The armistice at Monterey had ceased by the order\r\nof our government, and the commander of our forces, leaving Generals\r\nWorth and Butler at Monterey and Saltillo which had been seized,\r\nhastened with a sufficient body of troops to the gulf for the purpose\r\nof occupying Tampico, the capital of the state of Tamaulipas. But he\r\ndid not advance further than Victoria, when he found that Tampico had\r\nsurrendered to Commodore Conner on the 14th of November.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the political aspect of Mexico was changed under the\r\nrule of Santa Anna who had returned to power, though he had not\r\nrealized the hopes of our president by acceding to an honorable peace.\r\nA secret movement that was made by an agent sent into the country\r\nproved altogether unsuccessful, for the people were aroused against\r\nthis union, and would listen, willingly, to no advances for\r\naccommodation. Santa Anna, cautiously noted the national feeling, and,\r\nbeing altogether unable to control or modify it,--although he\r\nstudiously refrained from committing himself prior to his return to\r\nthe capital,--he resolved to place himself at the head of the popular\r\nmovement in defence of the northern frontier. Accordingly, in\r\nDecember, 1846, he had already assembled a large force, amounting to\r\ntwenty thousand men, at San Luis Potosi, the capital of the state of\r\nthat name south of Monterey, on the direct road to the heart of the\r\ninternal provinces, and nearly midway between the gulf and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe news of this hostile gathering which was evidently designed to\r\nassail our Army of Occupation, soon reached the officers who had been\r\nleft in command at our headquarters during Taylor's absence; and, in\r\nconsequence of a despatch sent by express to General Wool at Parras\r\nfor reinforcements, that officer immediately put his whole column in\r\nmotion, and, after marching one hundred and twenty miles in four days,\r\nfound himself at Agua Nueva, within twenty-one miles of Saltillo. Thus\r\nsustained, the officers in command, awaited with anxiety, the\r\nmovements of the Mexican chief and the return of General Taylor.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, the administration at home, seeing the inutility\r\nof continuing the attacks upon the more northern outposts of\r\nMexico,--which it was, nevertheless, resolved to hold as indemnifying\r\nhostages, inasmuch as they were contiguous to our own soil and\r\nboundaries,--determined to strike a blow at the vitals of Mexico by\r\nseizing her principal eastern port and proceeding thence to the\r\ncapital. For this purpose, General Scott, who had been set aside at\r\nthe commencement of the war in consequence of a rupture between\r\nhimself and the war department whilst arranging the details of the\r\ncampaign,--was once more summoned into the field and appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the American army in Mexico. Up to this period,\r\nNovember, 1846, large recruits of regulars and volunteers had flocked\r\nto the standard of Taylor and were stationed at various posts in the\r\nvalley of the Rio Grande, under the command of Generals Butler, Worth,\r\nPatterson, Quitman and Pillow. But the project of a descent upon Vera\r\nCruz, which was warmly advocated by General Scott, made it necessary\r\nto detach a considerable portion of these levies, and of their most\r\nefficient and best drilled members. Taylor and his subordinate\r\ncommanders, were thus, placed in a mere defensive position, and that,\r\ntoo, at a moment when they were threatened in front by the best army\r\nthat had been assembled for many a year in Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the government of the United States, at the moment\r\nit planned this expedition to Vera Cruz and the capital, was not fully\r\napprised of the able and efficient arrangements of Santa Anna, or\r\nimagined that he would immediately quit San Luis Potosi in order to\r\ndefend the eastern access to the capital, inasmuch as it was not\r\nprobable that Taylor would venture to penetrate the country with\r\nimpaired forces, which, in a strictly military point of view, were not\r\nmore than adequate for garrison service along an extended base of\r\nthree hundred miles. But, as the sequel showed, they neither estimated\r\nproperly the time that would be consumed in concentrating the forces\r\nand preparing the means for their transportation to Vera Cruz, nor\r\njudged correctly of the military skill of Santa Anna, who naturally\r\npreferred to crush the weak northern foe with his overwhelming force\r\nthan to encounter the strong battalions of veterans who were to be led\r\nagainst him on the east by the most brilliant captain of our country.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of General Scott was one of extraordinary magnitude and\r\nresponsibility. With his usual foresight he determined that he would\r\nnot advance until the expedition was perfectly complete in every\r\nessential of certain success. Nothing was permitted to disturb his\r\nequanimity or patient resolution in carrying out the scheme as he\r\nthought best. He weighed all the dangers and all the difficulties of\r\nthe adventure, and placed no reliance upon the supposed weakness of\r\nthe enemy. This was the true, soldier-like view of the splendid\r\nproject; and if, at the time, men were found inconsiderate enough to\r\nblame him for procrastinating dalliance, the glorious result of his\r\nenterprise repaid him for all the petty sneers and misconceptions with\r\nwhich his discretion was undervalued by the carpet knights at home.\r\nThere is but one point upon which we feel justified in disagreeing\r\nwith his plan of campaign. He should not have weakened the command of\r\nGeneral Taylor in the face of Santa Anna's army. It was almost an\r\ninvitation to that chief for an attack upon the valley of the Rio\r\nGrande; and had the Army of Occupation been effectually destroyed at\r\nBuena Vista, scarcely an American would have remained, throughout the\r\nlong line of Taylor's base, to tell the tale of cruelties perpetrated\r\nby the flushed and revengeful victors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhilst events were maturing and preparations making in the valley of\r\nthe Rio Grande and the island of Lobos, we shall direct our attention\r\nagain for a short time to the central regions of the north of Mexico\r\nin the neighborhood of Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nA considerable force of Missourians had been organized under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Doniphan, and marched to New Mexico, whence it was\r\ndesigned to despatch him towards Chihuahua. Soon after General\r\nKearney's departure from Santa Fé for California, Colonel Price, who\r\nwas subsequently raised to the rank of general, reached that post with\r\nhis western recruits and took command, whilst Doniphan was directed,\r\nby orders from Kearney, dated near La Joya, to advance with his\r\nregiment against the Navajo Indians, who had threatened with war the\r\nNew Mexicans, now under our protection. He performed this service\r\nsuccessfully; and, on the 22d of November, 1846, made a treaty with\r\nthe chiefs, binding them to live in amity with the Spaniards and\r\nAmericans. Reassembling all his troops at Val Verde, he commenced his\r\nmarch to the south, in the middle of December, and, after incredible\r\ndifficulties and great sufferings from inadequate supplies and\r\nequipments he reached Chihuahua, fighting, on the march, two\r\nsuccessful actions against the Mexicans at Bracito, and Sacramento.\r\nHaving completely routed the enemy in the latter contest, Chihuahua\r\nfell into his power. Here he tarried, recruiting his toil-worn band,\r\nfor six weeks, and, as the spring opened, pushed onwards to the south\r\nuntil he reached the headquarters of Taylor, whence he returned with\r\nhis regiment to the United States. His army marched five thousand\r\nmiles during the campaign, and its adventures form one of the most\r\nromantic episodes in the war with Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhilst Doniphan was advancing southward, the command of Price was well\r\nnigh destroyed in New Mexico and the wild region intervening between\r\nits borders and the frontiers of the United States. A conspiracy had\r\nbeen secretly organized, among the Mexican and half-breed population,\r\nto rise against the Americans. On the 19th of January, 1847, massacres\r\noccurred, simultaneously, at Taos, Arroyo Hondo, Rio Colorado and\r\nMora. At Taos, Governor Charles Bent, one of the oldest and most\r\nexperienced residents in that region was cruelly slain, and a great\r\ndeal of valuable property destroyed by the merciless foe. Price\r\nreceived intelligence of this onslaught on the 20th, and rapidly\r\ncalling in his outposts, marched with a hastily gathered band of about\r\nthree hundred and fifty men against the enemy, whom he met, attacked\r\nand overawed on the 24th, at Cañada. Reinforced by Captain Burgwin\r\nfrom Alburquerque, he again advanced against the insurgents; and on\r\nthe 28th, defeated a Mexican force estimated at fifteen hundred, at\r\nthe pass of El Embudo. Passing, thence, over the Taos mountain,\r\nthrough deep snows, in midwinter, the resolute commander pursued his\r\nway unmolested through the deserted settlement which had been recently\r\nravaged by the rebels, nor did he encounter another force until he\r\ncame upon the enemy at Pueblo, when he stormed the fortified position,\r\nand gained the day but with the loss of the gallant Burgwin and other\r\nvaluable officers. Mora was reduced again to subjection, early in\r\nFebruary, by Captain Morin; and, in all these rapid but successful\r\nactions, it is estimated that near three hundred Mexicans paid the\r\nforfeit of their lives for the cruel conspiracy and its fatal results.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the tenure of our possessions in New Mexico was no\r\nlonger considered secure. The troops in that district were not the\r\nbest disciplined or most docile in the army, and, to the dangers of\r\nanother sudden outbreak among the treacherous Mexicans, was added the\r\nfear of a sudden rising among the Indian tribes who were naturally\r\nanxious to find any pretext or chance for ridding the country of a foe\r\nwhom they feared far more, as a permanent neighbor, than the\r\ncomparatively feeble half-breeds and Mexicans.\r\n\r\nIn December of 1846, Lieutenant Richie, who bore despatches to Taylor\r\napprising him of the meditated attack upon Vera Cruz, was seized and\r\nslain by the Mexicans whilst on his way to the headquarters, and,\r\nthus, Santa Anna became possessed of the plan of the proposed\r\ncampaign. The Army of Occupation had been sadly impaired by the\r\nabstraction of its best material for future action on the southern\r\nline under the commander-in-chief. But General Taylor resolved at once\r\nto face the danger stoutly, and to manifest no symptom of\r\nunsoldierlike querulousness under the injustice he experienced from\r\nthe government. Nevertheless,--prudent in all things, and foreseeing\r\nthe danger of his command, of the lower country, and of the _morale_\r\nof the whole army, in the event of his defeat,--he exposed the error\r\nof the war department in his despatches to the adjutant general and\r\nsecretary, so that history, if not arms, might eventually do justice\r\nto his discretion and fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe note of preparation preceded, for some time, the actual advent of\r\nSanta Anna from San Luis Potosi, and all was bustle in the American\r\nencampments which were spread from Monterey to Agua Nueva beyond\r\nSaltillo, in order to give him the best possible reception under the\r\ncircumstances. Wool was encamped with a force at Agua Nueva, in\r\nadvance on the road from Saltillo to San Luis, about thirteen miles\r\nfrom the pass of Angostura, where the road lies through a mountain\r\ngorge, defended, on one side, by a small table land near the\r\nacclivities of the steep sierra and cut with the channels of rough\r\nbarrancas or ravines worn by the waters as they descend from the\r\nsummits, and, on the other by an extensive net work of deep and\r\nimpassable gullies which drained the slopes of the western spurs.\r\n\r\nThis spot was decided upon, as the battle ground in the event of an\r\nattack, and the encampment at Agua Nueva, in front of it was kept up\r\nas an extreme outpost, whence the scouts might be sent forth to watch\r\nthe approach of Santa Anna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIERRA MADRE PASS.]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February, the positive advance of that chief was\r\nannounced. The camp was immediately broken up, and all our forces\r\nrapidly concentrated in the gorge of Angostura. Our troops did not\r\namount to more than four thousand six hundred and ninety efficient\r\nmen, while we had reason to believe that Santa Anna commanded nearly\r\nfive times that number and was greatly superior to us in cavalry, a\r\npart of which, had been sent by secret paths through the mountains, to\r\nthe rear of our position, so as to cut off our retreat, in the event\r\nof our failure in the battle.\r\n\r\nThe great object of Taylor in selecting his ground and forming his\r\nplan of battle, was to make his small army equal, as near as possible,\r\nto that of Santa Anna, by narrowing the front of attack, and thus\r\nconcentrating his force upon any point through which the Mexicans\r\nmight seek to break. In other words, it was his design to dam up the\r\nstrait of Angostura with a living mass, and to leave no portion of the\r\nunbroken ground on the narrow table-land undefended by infantry and\r\nartillery. The battle ground that had been selected was admirably\r\ncalculated for this purpose; and his foresight was justified by the\r\nresult. It was not necessary for Taylor to capture, or annihilate his\r\nenemy, for he was victor, if with, but a single regiment, he kept the\r\nvalley closed against the Mexicans. The centre of the American line\r\nwas the main road, in which was placed a battery of eight pieces,\r\nreduced, during the action to five, supported by bodies of infantry.\r\nOn the right of the stream, which swept along the edge of the western\r\nmountains, was a single regiment and some cavalry, with two guns,\r\nwhich it was supposed, would be sufficient, with the aid of the\r\ntangled gulleys to arrest the Mexicans in that quarter. On the left of\r\nthe stream, where the ravines were fewer, and the plain between them\r\nwider, stood two regiments of infantry, suitably furnished with\r\nartillery, and extending from the central battery on the road, to the\r\nbase of the eastern mountains, on whose skirts an adequate force of\r\ncavalry and riflemen was posted.\r\n\r\nIn order to break this array, Santa Anna divided his army into three\r\nattacking columns, each of which nearly doubled the whole of Taylor's\r\nforce. One of these, was opposed to the battery of eight guns in order\r\nto force the road, and the other two were designed to outflank our\r\nposition by penetrating or turning the squadrons stationed at the base\r\nof the mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 22d of February, the attack began by a\r\nskirmishing attempt to pass to the rear of our left wing; but as the\r\nMexicans climbed the mountain, in their endeavor to outflank us in that\r\nquarter, they were opposed by our infantry and riflemen, who disputed\r\nsuccessfully every inch of ground, until night closed and obliged the\r\nMexicans to retire. General Taylor, fearing an attack from the cavalry\r\nupon Saltillo, immediately departed with a suitable escort to provide\r\nfor its safety, and left General Wool to command during his absence.\r\n\r\nAfter day dawn, on the 23d, Santa Anna again commenced the battle, by\r\nan attack upon the left wing, and, for a while, was withstood, until a\r\nportion of our forces, after a brave defence, mistaking an order to\r\nretire, for an order to retreat, became suddenly panic-struck, and\r\nfled from the field. At this moment, Taylor returned from Saltillo,\r\nand found the whole left of our position broken, whilst the enemy was\r\npouring his masses of infantry and cavalry along the base of the\r\neastern mountains towards our rear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the battery in the road had repulsed the Mexican column sent\r\nagainst it, and spared three of its guns for service on the upper\r\nplain. The regiment, on the right of the stream, had been brought over\r\nto the left bank with its cannons, and was now, in position with two\r\nother regiments, facing the mountains, between which and this force,\r\nwas a gap, through whose opening, the Mexicans steadily advanced under\r\na dreadful fire. Nearly all the artillery had been concentrated at the\r\nsame place, while, in other parts of the field and nearer to the\r\n_hacienda_ of Buena Vista, in the American rear, were bodies of our\r\ncavalry, engaged in conflict with the advancing foe.\r\n\r\nAs Taylor approached this disastrous scene, he met the fugitives, and\r\nspeedily made his dispositions to stop the carnage. With a regiment\r\nfrom Mississippi, he restrained a charge of Mexican cavalry, and\r\nordered all the artillery, save four guns, to the rear to drive back\r\nthe exulting Mexicans. This man[oe]uvre was perfectly successful, and,\r\nso dreadfully was the enemy cut up by the new attack, that Santa Anna,\r\navailed himself of a _ruse_, by a flag of truce, in order to suspend\r\nthe action, whilst he withdrew his men.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of so large a portion of Taylor's most efficient troops to\r\nthe rear of his original line, had greatly weakened his front, in the\r\nbest positions, where the inequalities of ground sustained his feeble\r\nnumbers. Santa Anna was not unmindful of the advantage he had gained by\r\nthese untoward events, and prepared all his best reserves, which were\r\nnow brought for the first time into action, for another attack. Taylor\r\nhad with him three regiments and four pieces of artillery. His front was\r\nrather towards the mountain than the open pass, while his back was\r\ntowards the road along the stream. On his right was the whole Mexican\r\narmy; on his left, far off in the rear, were the troops that had\r\nrepulsed and cut up the Mexican column; and the great effort, upon whose\r\nsuccess all depended, was to bring these dispersed squadrons again into\r\naction, whilst he maintained the position against the assault of the\r\nfresh reserves. As Santa Anna advanced with his inspirited columns, he\r\nwas met by regiments of infantry, which stood firm, until, overwhelmed\r\nby numbers and driven into a ravine, they were cruelly slaughtered.\r\nAfter the American infantry had been overcome, the last hope was in the\r\nartillery, and, with this, the Mexican advance was effectually stopped\r\nand the battle won.\r\n\r\nThe whole day had been spent in fighting, and when night came, the\r\nfield was covered with dead. It was an anxious season for our battered\r\ntroops, and whilst all were solicitous for the event of a contest,\r\nwhich it was supposed would be renewed on the morrow, the greatest\r\nefforts were not only made to inspirit the troops who had borne the\r\nbrunt of two days' battle, but to bring up reinforcements of artillery\r\nand cavalry that had been stationed between Saltillo and Monterey. At\r\nday dawn, however, on the 24th, the enemy was found to have retreated.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful battle saved the north of Mexico and the valley of the\r\nRio Grande; for Miñon and Urrea were already in our rear with regular\r\ntroops and bands of _rancheros_, ready to cut up our flying army, and\r\ndescend upon our slender garrisons. Urrea captured a valuable wagon\r\ntrain at Ramos, in the neighborhood of Monterey. From the 22d to the\r\n26th of February, he continually threatened our weakened outposts, and\r\nfrom that period until the 7th of March inflicted severe injuries upon\r\nour trains and convoys from the gulf. In the meantime Santa Anna\r\nretreated to San Luis Potosi with the fragments of his fine army, and\r\nnot long after, General Taylor retired from a field of service, in\r\nwhich he was no longer permitted to advance, or required except for\r\ngarrison duty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the months of October and November, 1846, Tobasco and Tampico had\r\nyielded to our navy; the former after a severe attack conducted by\r\nCommodore Matthew C. Perry, and the latter without bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1846-1847.\r\n\r\n    SANTA ANNA'S RETURN--CHANGES HIS PRINCIPLES.--SALAS\r\n    EXECUTIVE.--CONSTITUTION OF 1824 RESTORED--PAREDES.--PLANS OF\r\n    SALAS AND SANTA ANNA--HIS LETTER TO ALMONTE--HIS VIEWS OF THE\r\n    WAR--REFUSES THE DICTATORSHIP--COMMANDS THE ARMY.--STATE OF\r\n    PARTIES IN MEXICO--PUROS--MODERADOS--SANTA ANNA AT SAN\r\n    LUIS.--PEACE PROPOSITIONS--INTERNAL TROUBLES.--FARIAS'S\r\n    CONTROVERSY WITH THE CHURCH.--POLKO REVOLUTION IN THE\r\n    CAPITAL--VICE PRESIDENCY SUPPRESSED--IMPORTANT DECREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna landed from the steamer Arab,\r\nafter having been permitted to pass the line of our blockading fleet\r\nat Vera Cruz he was received by only a few friends. His reception was\r\nin fact not a public one, nor marked by enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBy the revolution which overthrew Paredes, General Salas came into the\r\nexercise of the chief executive authority, and as soon as Santa Anna\r\narrived he despatched three high officers to welcome him, among whom\r\nwas Valentin Gomez Farias, a renowned leader of the federalist party,\r\nin former days a bitter foe of the exiled chief. Santa Anna, in his\r\ncommunications with the revolutionists from Cuba, had confessed his\r\npolitical mistake, in former years, in advocating the central system.\r\n\"The love of provincial liberty,\" said he, in a letter to a friend\r\ndated in Havana on the 8th of March, 1846, \"being firmly rooted in the\r\nminds of all, and the democratic principle predominating every where,\r\nnothing can be established in a solid manner in the country, which\r\ndoes not conform to these tendencies, nor can we without them attain\r\neither order, peace, prosperity or respectability among foreign nations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD OF BUENA VISTA.]\r\n\r\n\"To draw every thing to the _centre_, and thus to give unity of action\r\nto the republic as I at one time deemed best, is no longer possible;\r\nnay, more, I say it is dangerous; it is contrary to the object I\r\nproposed to myself in the Unitarian system, because we thereby expose\r\nourselves to the separation of the northern departments which are most\r\nclamorous for freedom of internal administration. * * * * I therefore\r\nurge you to use all your influence to reconcile the liberals,\r\ncommunicating with Señor Farias and his friends, in order to induce\r\nthem to come to an understanding with us. * * * * I will in future,\r\nsupport the claims of the masses; leaving the people entirely at\r\nliberty to organize their system of government and to regulate their\r\noffices in a manner that may please them best.\"\r\n\r\nThese declarations, and the knowledge of Santa Anna's sagacity and\r\ninfluence with the masses had probably induced Farias to adhere to the\r\nproject of his recall which was embraced in the movements of the\r\nrevolutionists. And, accordingly, we find that upon his landing, Santa\r\nAnna published a long manifesto to the people which he concludes by\r\nrecommending that, until they proclaim a new constitution, the federal\r\nconstitution of 1824 be readopted for the internal administration of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nSalas, who had previously ordered the governors of the departments to\r\nbe guided solely by the commands of Santa Anna, immediately issued a\r\n_bando nacional_, or edict, countersigned by the acting secretary of\r\nstate, Monasterio, which embodied the views of the returned exile, and\r\nproclaimed the constitution of 1824, in accordance with his\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nParedes, meanwhile, who had been taken prisoner on the 5th of August,\r\n1846, whilst attempting to fly the country, was held in close\r\nconfinement at the castle of Peroté. Some persons proposed to treat\r\nhim severely in consequence of his monarchical notions; but Salas\r\naverted dexterously all the spiteful blows that were aimed at him, and\r\nhe was finally allowed to retire to Europe, where he remained until a\r\nlater period of the war, when he returned to yield no significant\r\nservices to his invaded country. Since the termination of the contest\r\nhe has paid the great debt of nature, on his native soil, and a\r\nmerciful pen will conceal the faults of a mixed nature which was not\r\nunadorned by virtues, and, under other circumstances and with\r\ndifferent habits, might have made him a useful ruler in Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral Salas, who exercised supreme command from the 7th to the 20th\r\nof August, professed to have done as little as possible of his own\r\nwill, and only what was urgently demanded by the necessity of the\r\ncase. He boasted, however, that he had effected what he could \"to aid\r\nthe brave men who, in Monterey, have determined to die rather than\r\nsuccumb to the invasion and perfidiousness of the Americans.\" In his\r\ncommunications to Santa Anna he urged him to hasten to Mexico as soon\r\nas possible to assume his powers, and the Mexican gazettes commend him\r\nfor refusing to accept the pay of president while discharging the\r\nfunctions of his office.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August, Salas issued a proclamation, in which he\r\nannounced to his countrymen that a new insult had been offered to\r\nthem, and that another act of baseness had been perpetrated by the\r\nAmericans. He alluded to the Californias, which, he said, \"the\r\nAmericans have now seized by the strong hand, after having villanously\r\nrobbed us of Texas.\" He announced that the expedition which had been\r\nso long preparing would set forth in two days for the recovery of the\r\ncountry, and that measures would be taken to arrange the differences\r\nexisting between the people of the Californias and the various\r\npreceding central administrations. In conclusion, he appealed\r\neloquently to the Californians to second with their best exertions the\r\nattempt which would be made to drive out the Americans, and to unite\r\ntheir rich and fertile territories forever to the Republic.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of this chief, various proclamations were\r\nissued to arouse the people to take part in the war, by enlisting and\r\nby contributing their means. Efforts were also made to organize the\r\nlocal militia, but with little effect.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna, in his reply to Salas on the 20th of August, accepts the\r\ntrust which is formally devolved upon him, and approves of the acts of\r\nthe latter, especially in sending forward all the troops to Monterey,\r\nNew Mexico, and California, and in summoning a Congress for the 6th of\r\nDecember. These, he says, are the two first wants of the nation, the\r\nformation of a constitution for the country, and the purification of\r\nthe soil of the country from foreign invaders. These ends gained, he\r\nwill gladly lay down his power. \"My functions will cease,\" he says,\r\n\"when I have established the nation in its rights; when I see its\r\ndestinies controlled by its legitimate representatives, and when I may\r\nbe able, by the blessing of heaven, to lay at the feet of the national\r\nrepresentatives laurels plucked on the banks of the Sabine--all of\r\nwhich must be due to the force and the will of the Mexican people.\"\r\n\r\nSanta Anna at length quitted his hacienda, where he had doubtless been\r\nwaiting for the opportune moment to arrive when he could best exhibit\r\nhimself to the inhabitants of the capital, and profit by their highest\r\nenthusiasm, pushed to an extreme by alternate hopes and fears. On the\r\n14th of September he reached Ayotla, a small town distant twenty-five\r\nmiles from the city of Mexico. Here he received a communication from\r\nAlmonte, the secretary of war, _ad interim_, proposing to him the\r\nsupreme executive power, or dictatorship. This offer was made on the\r\npart of the provisional government.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna immediately replied in the following strain to the missive\r\nof his partizan:\r\n\r\n    General SANTA ANNA, commander-in-chief of the Liberating Army, to\r\n    General ALMONTE, minister of war of the republic of Mexico.\r\n\r\n  AYOTLA, 1 o'clock, A. M., Sept. 14, 1846.\r\n\r\n    SIR: I have received your favor of this date, acknowledging a\r\n    decree issued by the supreme government of the nation, embracing a\r\n    programme of the proceedings adopted to regulate a due celebration\r\n    of the re-establishment of the constitution of 1824, the\r\n    assumption by myself of the supreme executive power, and the\r\n    anniversary of the glorious _grito_ of Dolores.\r\n\r\n    My satisfaction is extreme to observe the enthusiasm with which\r\n    preparations are made to celebrate the two great blessings which\r\n    have fallen upon this nation--her independence and her\r\n    liberty--and I am penetrated with the deepest gratitude to find\r\n    that my arrival at the capital will be made to contribute to the\r\n    solemnities of so great an occasion. In furtherance of this object\r\n    I shall make my entrée into that city to-morrow at midday, and\r\n    desire, in contributing my share to the national jubilee, to\r\n    observe such a course as may best accord with my duties to my\r\n    country--beloved of my heart--and with the respect due to the will\r\n    of the sovereign people.\r\n\r\n    I have been called by the voice of my fellow-citizens to exercise\r\n    the office of commander-in-chief of the army of the republic. I\r\n    was far from my native land when intelligence of this renewed\r\n    confidence, and of these new obligations imposed upon me by my\r\n    country was brought to me, and I saw that the imminent dangers\r\n    which surrounded her on all sides, formed the chief motive for\r\n    calling me to the head of the army. I now see a terrible contest\r\n    with a perfidious and daring enemy impending over her, in which\r\n    the Mexican republic must reconquer the insignia of her glory and\r\n    a fortunate issue, if victorious, or disappear from the face of\r\n    the earth, if so unfortunate as to be defeated. I also see a\r\n    treacherous faction raising its head from her bosom, which, in\r\n    calling up a form of government detested by the united nation,\r\n    provokes a preferable submission to foreign dominion; and I\r\n    behold, at last, that after much vacillation, that nation is\r\n    resolved to establish her right to act for herself, and to arrange\r\n    such a form of government as best suits her wishes.\r\n\r\n    All this I have observed, and turned a listening ear to the cry of\r\n    my desolated country, satisfied that she really needed my weak\r\n    services at so important a period. Hence I have come, without\r\n    hesitation or delay, to place myself in subjection to her will;\r\n    and, desirous to be perfectly understood, upon reaching my native\r\n    soil, I gave a full and public expression of my sentiments and\r\n    principles. The reception which they met convinced me that I had\r\n    not deceived myself, and I am now the more confirmed in them, not\r\n    from having given them more consideration, but because they have\r\n    found a general echo in the hearts of my fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n    I come, then, to carry my views into operation, and in compliance\r\n    with the mandate of my country. She calls me as commander-in-chief\r\n    of the army, and in that capacity I stand ready to serve. The\r\n    enemy occupies our harbors--he is despoiling us of the richest of\r\n    our territories, and threatens us with his domination! I go, then,\r\n    to the head of the Mexican army--an army the offspring of a free\r\n    people--and joined with it, I will fulfil my utmost duty in\r\n    opposing the enemies of my country. I will die fighting, or lead\r\n    the valiant Mexicans to the enjoyment of a triumph to which they\r\n    are alike entitled by justice, by their warlike character, and by\r\n    the dignity and enthusiasm which they have preserved, of a free\r\n    nation. The war is a necessity of immediate importance; every\r\n    day's delay is, an age of infamy; I cannot recede from the\r\n    position which the nation has assigned me; I must go forward,\r\n    unless I would draw upon myself the censure due to ingratitude for\r\n    the favors with which I have been overwhelmed by my\r\n    fellow-citizens; or, unless I would behold her humbled and\r\n    suffering under a perpetuation of her misfortunes.\r\n\r\n    Your excellency will at once perceive how great an error I should\r\n    commit in assuming the supreme magistracy, when my duty calls me\r\n    to the field, to fight against the enemies of the republic. I\r\n    should disgrace myself, if, when called to the point of danger, I\r\n    should spring to that of power! Neither my loyalty nor my honor\r\n    requires the abandonment of interests so dear to me. The single\r\n    motive of my heart is to offer my compatriots the sacrifice of\r\n    that blood which yet runs in my veins. I wish them to know that I\r\n    consecrate myself entirely to their service, as a soldier ought to\r\n    do, and am only desirous further to be permitted to point out the\r\n    course by which Mexico may attain the rank to which her destinies\r\n    call her.\r\n\r\n    In marching against the enemy, and declining to accept power, I\r\n    give a proof of the sincerity of my sentiments; leaving the nation\r\n    her own mistress, at liberty to dispose of herself as she sees\r\n    fit. The elections for members of a congress to form the\r\n    constitution which the people wish to adopt, are proceeding. That\r\n    congress will now soon convene, and while I shall be engaged in\r\n    the conflict in armed defence of her independence, the nation will\r\n    place such safeguards around her liberties as may best suit herself.\r\n\r\n    If I should permit myself for a single moment, to take the reins\r\n    of government, the sincerity of my promises would be rendered\r\n    questionable, and no confidence could be placed in them.\r\n\r\n    I am resolved that they shall not be falsified, for in their\r\n    redemption I behold the general good, as well as my honor as a\r\n    Mexican and a soldier. I cannot abandon this position. The\r\n    existing government has pursued a course with which the nation has\r\n    shown itself content, and I have no desire to subvert it by taking\r\n    its place. I feel abundant pleasure in remaining where I am, and\r\n    flatter myself that the nation will applaud my choice. I shall\r\n    joyfully accept such tasks as she shall continue to impose upon\r\n    me; and while she is engaged in promoting the objects of\r\n    civilization, I will brave every danger in supporting its\r\n    benefits, even at the cost of my existence.\r\n\r\n    Will your excellency have the goodness to tender to the supreme\r\n    government my sincere thanks for their kindness? I will personally\r\n    repeat them to-morrow, for which purpose I propose to call at the\r\n    palace. I shall there embrace my friends, and hastily pressing\r\n    them to my heart, bid them a tender farewell, and set out to the\r\n    scene of war, to lend my aid to serve my country, or to perish\r\n    among its ruins.\r\n\r\n    I beg to repeat to your excellency assurances of my continued and\r\n    especial esteem.\r\n\r\n  ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September, Santa Anna arrived at the capital, amid\r\nrejoicings more enthusiastic than had ever been witnessed before. The\r\npeople seemed to behold in him their saviour, and were almost frantic\r\nwith joy. The testimonies of attachment to his person were unbounded,\r\nand the next day the most vigorous measures, so far as declarations\r\ngo, were adopted by the provisional government.\r\n\r\nA levy of thirty thousand men to recruit the army was ordered.\r\nRequisitions were forthwith transmitted to all the principal places in\r\nthe republic, for their respective quotas of men. Puebla, and the\r\nwhole of the towns within a circuit of fifty or sixty leagues of the\r\nmetropolis, are stated to have complied with the requisition for\r\ntroops, with the greatest alacrity. To facilitate the arming and\r\nequipping of this large body, the government ordered that duties on\r\nall munitions of war shall cease to be levied, until further notice.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna was thus once more in the capital and effectually at the\r\nhead of power; but he remained only a short time to attend to\r\npolitical matters, and dreading, doubtless, to assume openly the\r\nmanagement of the government or to trust himself away from the\r\nprotection of the military, he hastened to surround his person with\r\nthe army;--as commander-in-chief, he effectually controlled all the\r\ndepartments of the government.\r\n\r\nIn order to perceive distinctly the perilous position of Santa Anna,\r\nwe must understand the state of parties in Mexico. The revolution\r\nwhich placed him in power was brought about by a union of the\r\nfederalists with his partizans. Santa Anna, of course, retained an\r\ninfluence over his adherents after arriving in Mexico; but the\r\nfederalists were divided into two parties--the _Puros_ and\r\n_Moderados_, or, democrats and conservatives. The dissensions in these\r\nsections enabled Santa Anna, in a degree, to hold the balance between\r\nthem. SALAS, the acting executive, was a conservative, and Gomez\r\nFarias, president of the council of government, was a democrat.\r\nIntrigue after intrigue occurred in the cabinet and elsewhere among\r\nthe _ultras_ to supplant Salas, and several resignations gave evidence\r\nof the ill feeling and dissensions betwixt the ministers--Cortina and\r\nPacheco, both conservatives, resigned--and so did Rejon and Farias.\r\nThe National Guard intimated its discontent with the condition of\r\nthings very manifestly, and the new cabinet was filled with old\r\nenemies of Santa Anna. Meanwhile Almonte, the ablest man in the\r\ncountry, retained the ministry of war.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the state of San Luis Potosi pronounced against the\r\npresidency of General Salas, demanding that General Santa Anna should\r\nassume the executive functions, or that some one should be named by\r\nhim. As a precaution against the apprehended attempts upon his life,\r\nSalas retired on the 25th of October from the capital to Tacubaya. The\r\ngreater part of the permanent garrison of the capital took up its\r\nquarters in the same place. Santa Anna was probably determined that\r\nGeneral Salas should not obtain too absolute an ascendancy. Report\r\nsaid that Salas was honest enough to attempt to carry into effect all\r\nthe guaranties of the revolution of Jalisco and the citadel, and that\r\nhis policy did not suit the chief; but Santa Anna professed to act in\r\nthe utmost harmony with him.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak against the provisional government of General Salas was\r\nsoon suppressed, and Santa Anna remained in command of the army at San\r\nLuis Potosi, but without making any attack upon our forces on the Rio\r\nGrande after the defeat of Ampudia at Monterey, or endeavoring to\r\nprevent our subsequent capture of Victoria and Tampico.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of December congress voted, by states, for provisional\r\npresident and vice president. Each state had one vote in this\r\nelection, determined by the majority of its deputies. Twenty-two\r\nstates voted, including the federal district of Mexico, and two\r\nterritories. Santa Anna's opponent, Francisco Elorriega, was the\r\nchoice of nine states, and Gomez Farias was elected vice president.\r\nThe day before the election the members of the cabinet threw up their\r\nportfolios; and, in the midst of his evident political unpopularity\r\nwith the politicians Santa Anna seems to have been left by the\r\nauthorities at San Luis Potosi with an army destitute of efficient\r\narms, of military knowledge, and of the means of support. Santa Anna\r\naccepted the provisional presidency.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our army had been advancing steadily since the battles of\r\nResaca de la Palma and Palo Alto on the 8th and 9th of May, 1846.\r\nCalifornia had fallen into our hands, and New Mexico had been\r\nsubjugated. Tampico was, also, ours, and Taylor had pushed his\r\nvictorious army to Saltillo. Santa Anna stood, at bay, in San Luis\r\nPotosi; for he was not yet prepared to fight, and popular opinion\r\nwould not permit him to negotiate. In this forlorn condition he\r\nresorted to the usual occupation of the Mexican government when in\r\ndistress, and issued, despatch after despatch to stimulate congress,\r\nthe cabinet and the people in the lingering war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNor was the government of the United States, meanwhile, inattentive to\r\nthis position of affairs in Mexico, or indisposed to afford the\r\ngovernment an opportunity to reconcile our difficulties by negotiation.\r\nTwo distinct efforts were made by Mr. Buchanan, our secretary of state\r\nin the summer of 1846, and in January, 1847; but both proved abortive,\r\nand we were therefore obliged to continue hostilities.\r\n\r\nAt length, when Santa Anna perceived the enfeebled condition of\r\nGeneral Taylor, and believed that Scott would be for a long time\r\nhindered from effecting his attack upon Vera Cruz, he marched to Buena\r\nVista and experienced the sad reverse which we have already recounted.\r\nAs soon as the battle was over the wily and discomfited chief\r\nimmediately began to repair the losses of his arms by the eloquence\r\nand adroitness of his pen. In a long account of the battle he treats\r\nthe affair as almost a victory, and leaves the public mind of Mexico\r\nin doubt as to whether he had been beaten or victorious. The few\r\ntrophies, taken in the saddest moments of the action, were sent in\r\ntriumph to the interior and paraded as the _spolia opima_ in San Luis\r\nand the city of Mexico. The public men of the country knew that\r\nAngostura had in reality been lost, and Miñón who was seriously\r\nassailed in the press by Santa Anna for not co-operating at the\r\ncritical moment, published a reply in which he treated Santa Anna in\r\nthe plainest terms and denounced, as false, the general's statement\r\nthat his troops were famishing for food on the 24th of February, and\r\nthat his failure to destroy Taylor's army was only owing to this\r\nimportant fact! This system of mutual denunciation and recrimination\r\nwas quite common in Mexico, whenever a defeat was to be accounted for\r\nor thrown on the shoulders of an individual who was not in reality\r\nanswerable for it.\r\n\r\nWhen Santa Anna returned to San Luis Potosi, he entered that city with\r\nnot one half the army that accompanied him on his departure to the\r\nnorth. It was moreover worn out and disorganized by the long and\r\npainful march over the bleak desert, and had entirely lost its habit\r\nof discipline. Such was the condition of things at San Luis in the\r\nmonth of March, when Santa Anna found himself compelled to organize\r\nanother force to resist the enemy on the east; but whilst his\r\nattention was diligently directed to this subject the sad news reached\r\nhim, that Mexico was not only assailed from without, but that her\r\ncapital was torn by internal dissensions.\r\n\r\nThe peace between the president, and the vice president, Don Valentin\r\nGomez Farias, had been cemented by the good offices of mutual friends,\r\nthough it is not likely that any very ardent friendship could have\r\nsprung up suddenly between men whose politics had always been so\r\nwidely variant. Nor was there less difference between the moral than\r\nthe political character of these personages. Santa Anna, the selfish,\r\narrogant military chieftain,--a man of unquestionable genius and\r\ntalent for command,--had passed his life in spreading his sails to\r\ncatch the popular breeze, and by his alliances with the two most\r\npowerful elements of Mexican society,--the army and the church,--had\r\nalways contrived to sustain his eminent political position, or recover\r\nit when it was temporarily lost. Such was the case in his return to\r\npower after the invasion of the French, in the attack upon whom he\r\nfortunately lost a limb which became a constant capital upon which to\r\ntrade in the corrupt but sentimental market of popular favor. Valentin\r\nGomez Farias, on the contrary was a pure, straightforward,\r\nuncompromising patriot, always alive to the true progressive interests\r\nof the Mexican nation, and satisfied that these could only be secured\r\nby the successful imitation of our federal system, together with the\r\ndestruction of the large standing army, and the release of the large\r\nchurch properties from the incubus of mortmain.\r\n\r\nThere was much discontent in Mexico with the election of these two\r\npersonages to the presidency and vice presidency. Reflecting men\r\nthought the union unnatural, and although the desperate times required\r\ndesperate remedies, there was something so incongruous in the\r\npolitical alliance between Farias and Santa Anna, that little good\r\ncould be expected to issue from it. The clergy were alarmed for its\r\nwealth, and the moderate party was frightened by the habitual\r\ndespotism of Santa Anna. The latter personage was in fact, regarded\r\nwith more favor at the moment by all classes, than Farias, because the\r\ncountry had reason to believe him a man of action, and familiar in\r\ntimes of danger and distress, with all its resources of men and money;\r\nand as he was entirely occupied with the organization and management\r\nof the army at San Luis, the opposition party directed all its blows\r\nagainst the administration of the vice presidency.\r\n\r\nA few days after the installation of the new government, the agitation\r\nof the mortmain question was commenced in congress. The Puro party\r\nunited with the executive, made every effort to destroy the power of\r\nthe clergy, by undermining the foundation of its wealth, while the\r\nModerados became the supporters of the ecclesiastics, under the lead\r\nof Don Mariano Otero.\r\n\r\nAt length the law was passed, but it was not a frank and decided act,\r\ndestroying at once the privileges of the clergy and declaring their\r\npossessions to be the property of the republic. In fact it was a mere\r\ndecree for the seizure of ecclesiastical incomes, which threatened the\r\nnon-complying with heavy fines if they did not pay over to the civil\r\nauthorities, the revenues which had formerly been collected by the\r\nstewards of convents and monks.\r\n\r\nThis act, comparatively mild as it was, and temporary as it might have\r\nbeen considered, did not satisfy the clergy, even in this moment of\r\nnational peril. They resorted to the spiritual weapons which they\r\nreserved for extreme occasions. They fulminated excommunications; and\r\npublished dreadful threats of punishment hereafter for the crime that\r\nhad been committed by placing an impious hand upon wealth which they\r\nasserted belonged to God alone. This conduct of the religious orders\r\nhad its desired effect not only among the people, but among the\r\nofficers of government; for the chief clerk of the finance department,\r\nHurci, refused to sign the law, and it was sometime before a suitable\r\nperson could be found to put the law in operation. Santa Anna adroitly\r\nkept himself aloof from the controversy, and wrote from San Luis, that\r\nhe merely desired support for the army, and that in other questions,\r\nespecially those touching the clergy, he had no desire to enter, but\r\nwould limit himself to the recommendation, that neither the canons,\r\nnor the collegiate establishment of Guadalupe, should be molested,\r\ninasmuch as he entertained the greatest friendship for the one, and\r\nthe most reverential devotion for the other.\r\n\r\nBut the executive, fixed in its intention to liberate the property\r\nheld in mortmain, took every means to carry the law into effect, and\r\nexperienced the utmost resistance from the incumbents, especially when\r\nthe property happened to belong to the female sex, which is always\r\naverse from intercourse or dealings with persons who are regarded as\r\ninimical to the church.\r\n\r\nThis rigorous conduct of the executive, and the opposition it\r\nencountered from the Moderados, fomented by that powerful, spiritual\r\nclass which has so long controlled the conscience of the masses, gave\r\nrise, at this period, to the outbreak in the capital, which is known\r\nas the revolution of the Polkos. It began on the 22d of February,\r\n1847, in Mexico, whilst Santa Anna was firing the first guns at\r\nAngostura; and its great object was to drive Farias from executive\r\npower. The forces on both sides, amounted to six thousand men, and\r\nwere divided between the Polkos and the partizans of the government.\r\nFunds were found to support both factions, and from that time to the\r\n21st of March, the city of Mexico was converted into a battle field.\r\nOn the morning of that day Santa Anna, who had already despatched a\r\nportion of his broken army towards the coast, and who had been\r\napproached on his journey from the capital, by emissaries from both\r\nfactions, arrived at Guadalupe, and immediately the contest ceased.\r\nThe stewards of the convents refused to expend more money for the\r\nsupport of their partizans, and the treasury of the government was\r\nclosed against its adherents. The personal influence of Santa Anna\r\nthus put an end to a disgraceful rebellion which threatened the\r\nnationality of Mexico, within, whilst a foreign enemy was preparing to\r\nattack its most vital parts from the gulf.\r\n\r\nThe conflict of arms was over, but the partizans of the clergy did not\r\nintermit their efforts to get rid of the obnoxious vice-president; and\r\nat length, they effected pacifically, what they had been unable to do\r\nby force.\r\n\r\nThey brought in a bill declaring that \"the vice presidency of the\r\nrepublic, created by the decree of the 21st December, 1846, should be\r\nsuppressed.\" The debate upon this was of the most animated nature, the\r\nfriends and enemies of Farias showing equal vehemence in sustaining\r\ntheir views. On the 31st day of March the vote was taken, and the\r\nproposition carried by a vote of thirty-eight to thirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe following day a decree was passed embodying the above proposition\r\nand others:\r\n\r\n1. Permission is granted to the actual president of the republic to\r\ntake command in person of the forces which the government may place\r\nunder his command, to resist the foreign enemy.\r\n\r\n2. The vice presidency of the republic, established by the law of 21st\r\nDecember last, is suppressed.\r\n\r\n3. The place of the provisional president shall be filled by a\r\nsubstitute, named by congress according to the terms of the law just\r\ncited.\r\n\r\n4. If in this election the vote of the deputations should be tied, in\r\nplace of determining the choice by lot, congress shall decide, voting\r\nby person.\r\n\r\n5. The functions of the substitute shall cease when the provisional\r\npresident shall return to the exercise of power.\r\n\r\n6. On the 15th day of May next the legislatures of the states shall\r\nproceed to the election of a president of the republic, according to\r\nthe form prescribed by the constitution of 1824, and with no other\r\ndifference save voting for one individual only.\r\n\r\n7. The same legislatures shall at once transmit to the sovereign\r\ncongress the result of the election in a certified despatch.\r\n\r\nThis decree having been passed, it was at once signified to congress,\r\nthrough a minister, that Santa Anna was desirous of assuming the\r\ncommand of the army immediately and marching to the east to provide\r\nfor the national defence. Congress went at once into permanent\r\nsession, in order to choose a substitute for the president. The\r\nelection resulted in the choice of Señor D. Pedro Anaya. He received\r\nsixty votes and General Almonte eleven, voting by persons, and\r\neighteen votes against three, counting by deputations. The result\r\nbeing promulgated, permission was granted that Señor Anaya should at\r\nonce take the oath of office. This was on the 1st of April, and on the\r\n2d, Anaya entered upon his duties. He dispensed with the usual visits\r\nof congratulation and ceremony on account of the pressure of public\r\nbusiness, and Santa Anna left the capital for the army in the\r\nafternoon of the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL SCOTT AT LOBOS--LANDING AT AND SIEGE OF VERA\r\n    CRUZ--CAPITULATION AND CONDITION OF VERA CRUZ--CONDITION OF\r\n    MEXICO--ALVARADO, ETC., CAPTURED--SCOTT'S ADVANCE--DESCRIPTION OF\r\n    CERRO GORDO--MEXICAN DEFENCES AND MILITARY DISPOSAL THERE--BATTLE\r\n    OF CERRO GORDO.--PEROTÉ AND PUEBLA YIELD--SANTA ANNA\r\n    RETURNS--CONSTITUTION OF 1824 READOPTED--MEXICAN POLITICS OF THE\r\n    DAY--WAR SPIRIT--GUERILLAS--PEACE NEGOTIATIONS--TRIST--SANTA\r\n    ANNA'S SECRET NEGOTIATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary genius of Santa Anna, and the influence he possessed\r\nover his countrymen were perhaps never more powerfully manifested than\r\nin the manner in which, amid all these disasters, he maintained his\r\nreputation and popularity, and gathered a new army to defend the\r\neastern frontier of Mexico. But whilst he was engaged preparing in the\r\ninterior, we must return to the scene of General Scott's operations on\r\nthe coast. The small island of Lobos, about a hundred and twenty-five\r\nmiles from Vera Cruz, had been selected for the rendezvous of the\r\nseveral corps which were to compose the American invading army; and\r\nthe magnitude of the enterprize may be estimated from the fact, that\r\none hundred and sixty-three vessels were employed as transports. On\r\nthe seventh of March, Scott embarked his troops in the squadron under\r\nCommodore Connor, and on the ninth, landed the army upon the coast\r\nbelow the island of Sacrificios without the loss of a man, and without\r\nopposition from the neighboring city of Vera Cruz, which he summoned\r\nin vain to surrender. Having planted his batteries, and placed them\r\nunder the command of Colonel Bankhead, as Chief of Artillery, he\r\ncommenced a vigorous bombardment of the city on the eighteenth, aided,\r\nafloat and on shore, by the guns of the fleet which had been\r\ntransferred from Commodore Connor to the command of Commodore Perry.\r\nThe town was thus invested by land and water, and although the Mexican\r\ncastle, city walls and forts, were but poorly garrisoned and provided,\r\nthey held out bravely during the terrible siege, which nearly\r\nconverted Vera Cruz into a slaughter-house. On the morning of the\r\ntwenty-sixth, when no hope remained for the Mexicans, General\r\nLandero, the commander, made overtures for a capitulation, which being\r\nsatisfactorily arranged, the principal commercial port, and the most\r\nrenowned fortress in Mexico were surrendered, together with four\r\nhundred guns, five thousand stand of arms and as many prisoners who\r\nwere released on parole.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott had endeavored to mitigate the dangers of this terrific\r\nattack upon Vera Cruz by the employment of such a force as would\r\nhonorably satisfy the inefficient garrison of the town and castle that\r\nit was in truth unable to cope with the American forces. He delayed\r\nopening his batteries to allow the escape of non-combatants; he\r\nrefrained, moreover, from storming the town, a mode of assault in\r\nwhich multitudes would have fallen on both sides in the indiscriminate\r\nslaughter which always occurs when an enemy's town is invaded in hot\r\nblood and with a reckless spirit of conquest and carnage. Yet, weak\r\nand badly provided as was the garrison of both strongholds, the walls\r\nof the city, its batteries and its guardian castle held out for\r\nsixteen days, during which time it is estimated that our army and\r\nnavy, threw into the town about six thousand shot and shells, weighing\r\nupwards of 463,000 pounds. On the side of the Mexicans the slaughter\r\nwas exceedingly great. Nearly a thousand fell victims during the\r\nsiege; and, among the slain, numerous unfortunate citizens, women and\r\nchildren, were found to have perished by the bombs or paixhan shot\r\nwhich destroyed the public and private edifices, and ruined many\r\nimportant portions of the city.\r\n\r\nWhen this new disaster was reported in the capital and among the\r\nhighlands of Mexico, it spread consternation among the more secluded\r\nmasses who now began to believe that the heart of the country was\r\nseriously menaced. They had doubtless trusted to the traditionary,\r\nproverbial strength of San Juan de Ulua, and believed that the danger\r\nof disease and storm on the coast would serve to protect Vera Cruz\r\nfrom the attack of unacclimated strangers, during a season of\r\nhurricanes. Indeed, it was fortunate that our troops were landed from\r\nthe transports and men-of-war as early as they were in March, for\r\nalmost immediately afterwards, and during the siege, one of the most\r\nviolent _northers_ that ever ravaged these shores raged incessantly,\r\ndestroying many of the vessels whose warlike freight of men and\r\nmunitions had been so recently disembarked.\r\n\r\nBut if the people were ignorant of the true condition and strength of\r\nVera Cruz or its castle, such was not the case with the military men and\r\nnational authorities. They had made but little effort to guard it\r\nagainst Scott, of whose designed attack they had been long apprised,\r\nand they were probably prevented from doing so chiefly by the plans of\r\nSanta Anna, who supposed that Taylor would fall an easy prey to the\r\nlarge Mexican forces in the field at Buena Vista, especially as the\r\nAmerican army had been weakened by the abstraction of its regulars for\r\nthe operations at Vera Cruz. Victorious at Buena Vista, he could have\r\nhastened, by forced marches, to attack the invaders on the eastern\r\ncoast, and under the dismay of his anticipated victory in the north, he\r\nunquestionably imagined that they too would have fallen at once into his\r\ngrasp. Besides these military miscalculations, Mexico was so embarrassed\r\nin its pecuniary affairs, and disorganized in its Central Civil\r\nGovernment, that the proper directing power in the capital,--warned as\r\nit was,--had neither men nor means at hand to dispose along the coast of\r\nthe Gulf, or to station at points in its neighborhood whence they might\r\nquickly be thrown into positions which were menaced.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Santa Anna's voice was again heard in the\r\ncouncil and the field. At the conclusion of the last chapter we left\r\nhim hastening to the new scene of action; and when he announced the\r\ncapitulation of the vaunted castle and sea port of the Republic, he\r\ndeclared in his proclamation, that although \"chance might decree the\r\nfall of the capital of the Aztec empire under the power of the proud\r\nAmerican host, yet the _Nation_ shall not perish.\" \"I swear,\"\r\ncontinues he, \"that if my wishes are seconded by a sincere and\r\nunanimous effort, Mexico shall triumph! A thousand times fortunate for\r\nthe nation will the fall of Vera Cruz prove, if the disaster shall\r\nawaken in Mexican bosoms, the dignified enthusiasm, and generous ardor\r\nof true patriotism!\" This was the tone of appeal and encouragement in\r\nwhich he rallied the credulous and vain masses, the disheartened\r\ncountry, the dispersed troops of the north, and reanimated the broken\r\nfragments of the army which still continued in the field.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Scott placed Vera Cruz under the command of General\r\nWorth; opened the port to the long abandoned commerce which had\r\nlanguished during the blockade; established a moderate tariff, and\r\ntogether with the forces of the navy took possession of the ports of\r\nAlvarado and Tlacotlalpam on the south, and directed the future capture\r\nof Tuspan on the north of Vera Cruz. All his arrangements being\r\ncompleted, and these captures made and projected, he marched a large\r\nportion of his twelve thousand victorious troops towards the capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERA CRUZ.]\r\n\r\nWhen the road to the interior leaves Vera Cruz, it runs for a mile or\r\ntwo along the low, sandy, sea-beaten shore, and then strikes off,\r\nnearly at a right angle, in a gap among the sand-hills towards the\r\nwest. For many miles it winds slowly and heavily through the deep and\r\nshifting soil, until, as the traveller approaches the river Antigua,\r\nthe country begins to rise and fall by gentle elevations like the\r\nfirst heavy swells of the ocean. Passing this river at Puente Nacional\r\nover the noble and renowned bridge of that name, the aspect of the\r\nterritory becomes suddenly changed. The nearer elevations are steeper\r\nand more frequent, the road firmer and more rocky, while, in the\r\nwestern distance, the tall slopes of the Sierras rise rapidly in bold\r\nand wooded masses. All the features of nature are still strictly\r\ntropical, and wherever a scant and thriftless cultivation has\r\ndisplaced the thick vines, the rich flowers, and the dense foliage of\r\nthe forest, indolent natives may be seen idling about their cane-built\r\nhuts, or lazily performing only the most necessary duties of life.\r\nFurther on, at Plan del Rio the geological features of the coast\r\nassume another aspect. Here the road again crosses a small streamlet,\r\nand then suddenly strikes boldly into the side of the mountain which\r\nis to be ascended. About seven leagues from Jalapa the edge of one of\r\nthe table lands of the Cordillera sweeps down from the west abruptly\r\ninto this pass of the river Plan. On both sides of this precipitous\r\nelevation the mountains tower majestically. The road winds slowly and\r\nroughly along the scant sides which have been notched to receive it.\r\nWhen the summit of the pass is attained one side of the road is found\r\nto be overlooked by the Hill of the Telegraph, while on the other side\r\nthe streamlet runs in an immensely deep and rugged ravine, several\r\nhundred feet below the level of the table land. Between the road and\r\nthe river many ridges of the neighboring hills unite and plunge\r\ndownwards into the impassable abyss. At the foot of the Hill of the\r\nTelegraph, rises another eminence known as that of Atalaya, which is\r\nhemmed in by other wooded heights rising from below, and forming, in\r\nfront of the position a boundary of rocks and forests beyond which the\r\nsight cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\nWhen Don Manuel Robles left Vera Cruz, after its fall, he was desired\r\nby General Canalizo to examine the site of Cerro Gordo. After a full\r\nreconnoissance it was his opinion that it afforded a favorable spot in\r\nwhich the invaders might be at least injured or checked, but that was\r\nnot the proper point to dispute their passage to the capital by a\r\ndecisive victory. The most favorable position for resistance he\r\nbelieved to be at Corral Falso.\r\n\r\nThese views, however, did not accord with the opinions of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, who when the ground was explored under his own\r\neye, resolved to fortify it for the reception of the Americans. The\r\nbrigades of General Pinzon and Ranjel; the companies of Jalapa and\r\nCoatepec, commanded by Mata; and the veterans of the division of\r\nAngostura arrived also about this period, and their last sections\r\nreached the ground on the 12th. Meanwhile all was activity in the work\r\nof hasty fortification. Robles constructed a parapet at the edge of\r\nthe three hills, but failing to obtain all requisite materials for\r\nsuch a work, his erection merely served to mark the line of the\r\nMexican operations, and to form a breast-work whence the artillery and\r\ninfantry might command the ground over which, as the defenders\r\nsupposed, the Americans would be obliged to advance. Colonel Cano had\r\nalready cut off the access by the road at the point where it turned on\r\nthe right slope of the Telegraph, by placing a heavy battery. He also\r\nformed a covered way leading to the positions on the right, while\r\nGeneral Alcorta constructed a circular work on the summit of the\r\neminence and established within it a battery of four guns. In the\r\ncentre of this the national flag was hoisted, and off to the left\r\nnothing was seen but thick, thorny dells and barrancas, which were\r\nregarded by Santa Anna as impassable.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Mexican line of defences extending on the brink of these\r\nprecipices for nearly a mile, and, throughout it, the commander-in-chief\r\nhastened to distribute his forces. The extreme right was placed under\r\nthe command of General Pinzon, the next position under the naval\r\ncaptain, Buenaventura Aranjo, the next under Colonel Badillo, the next\r\nunder General Jarero, the next post, at the road, under General La Vega,\r\nand finally the extreme left, at the Telegraph, under Generals Vazquez,\r\nUraga and Colonel Palacios. The forces thus in position, according to\r\nthe Mexican account, amounted to three thousand three hundred and\r\nseventy men with fifty-two pieces of ordnance of various calibre. The\r\nremainder of the army, with the exception of the cavalry, which remained\r\nat Corral Falso until the 15th, was encamped on the sides of the road at\r\nthe _rancheria_ of Cerro Gordo, situated in the rear of the position. In\r\nthis neighborhood was placed the reserve, composed of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd\r\nand 4th light infantry, comprising 1,700 men; and the 1st and 11th\r\nregiments of the line, with 780 men, together with their artillery. It\r\nis said that the army was badly provided with food and suffered greatly\r\nfrom the climate and the innumerable insects which infest the region.\r\n\r\nAs Scott advanced against this position the dangers of his enterprize\r\nbecame manifest, and he caused a series of bold reconnoissances to be\r\nmade by Lieutenant Beaurgard and Captain Lee, of the engineers. He\r\nfound that the deep rocky ravine of the river protected the right\r\nflank of the Mexican position, while abrupt and seemingly impassable\r\nmountains and ridges covered the left. Between these points, for\r\nnearly two miles, a succession of fortified summits bristled with\r\nevery kind of available defence, while the top of Cerro Gordo\r\ncommanded the road on a gentle slope, like a _glacis_, for nearly a\r\nmile. An attack in front, therefore, would have been fatal to the\r\nAmerican army, and Scott resolved, accordingly, to cut a road to the\r\nright of his position so as to turn the left flank of the Mexicans. To\r\ncover his flank movements, on the 17th of April, he ordered General\r\nTwiggs to advance against the fort on the steep ascent, in front, and\r\nslightly to the left of the Cerro. Colonel Harney, with the rifles and\r\nsome detachments of infantry and artillery, carried this position\r\nunder a heavy fire, and, having secured it, elevated a large gun to\r\nthe summit of the eminence, and made a demonstration against a strong\r\nfort in the rear. Early on the 18th, the columns moved to the general\r\nattack. General Pillow's brigade assaulted the right of the Mexican\r\nentrenchments, and although compelled to retire, produced a powerful\r\nimpression on that part of the enemy's line. General Twigg's division\r\nstormed the vital part of Cerro Gordo, pierced the centre, gained\r\ncommand of the fortifications and cut them off from support; while\r\nColonel Riley's brigade of infantry rushed on against the main body of\r\nthe foe, turned the guns of their own fort against them, and compelled\r\nthe panic stricken crowd to fly in utter confusion. Shields' brigade,\r\nmeanwhile, assaulted the left, and carrying the rear battery, aided\r\nmaterially in completing the rout of the enemy. The whole American\r\nforce, in action and reserve, was 8,500. Three thousand prisoners,\r\nfour or five thousand stand of arms, and forty-three pieces of\r\nartillery, fell into Scott's hands. In the two days of conflict our\r\nloss amounted to 33 officers and 398 men, of whom 63 were killed. The\r\nenemy's loss was computed at 1,000 at least, while among the prisoners\r\nno less than two hundred and eighty officers and five generals were\r\nincluded. Santa Anna, and General Ampudia who was in the action,\r\nescaped with difficulty; and the commander-in-chief, accompanied by a\r\nfew friends and a small escort, finally reached Orizaba in safety,\r\nafter encountering numerous dangers amid the mountains and lonely\r\npaths through which he was obliged to pass.\r\n\r\nThis very decisive victory opened the path for the American army to\r\nthe highlands of the upper _plateau_ of Mexico, and, accordingly, our\r\nforces immediately pushed on to Jalapa and Peroté, both of which\r\nplaces were abandoned by the Mexicans without firing a gun. General\r\nWorth took possession of Peroté on the 22d of April, and received from\r\nColonel Velasquez, who had been left in charge of the fortress or\r\ncastle of San Carlos de Peroté by his retreating countrymen, 54 guns\r\nand mortars of iron and bronze, 11,065 cannon balls, 14,300 bombs and\r\nhand grenades, and 500 muskets. On capturing the post he learned that\r\nthe rout at Cerro Gordo had been complete. Three thousand cavalry\r\npassed the strong hold of Peroté in deplorable plight, while not more\r\nthan two thousand disarmed and famishing infantry had returned towards\r\ntheir homes in the central regions of Mexico. From Peroté Worth\r\nadvanced towards Puebla on the direct road to the capital.\r\n\r\nThus was Mexico again reduced to extreme distress by the loss of two\r\nimportant battles, the destruction of her third army raised for this\r\nwar, and the capture of her most valuable artillery and munitions. But\r\nthe national spirit of resistance was not subdued. If the government\r\ncould no longer restrain the invaders by organized armies, it resolved\r\nto imitate the example of the mother country during Napoleon's invasion,\r\nand to rouse the people to the formation of guerilla bands under daring\r\nand reckless officers. Bold as was this effort of patriotic despair, and\r\ncruelly successful as it subsequently proved against individuals or\r\ndetached parties of the Americans, it could effect nothing material\r\nagainst the great body of the consolidated army. Meanwhile the master\r\nspirit of the nation--Santa Anna--had not been idle in the midst of his\r\ndisheartening reverses. In little more than two weeks, he gathered\r\nnearly three thousand men from the fragments of his broken army, and\r\nmarched to Puebla, where he received notice of Worth's advance from\r\nPeroté. Sallying forth immediately with his force, he attacked the\r\nAmerican general at Amozoque, but, finding himself unable to check his\r\ncareer, returned with a loss of nearly ninety killed and wounded. On the\r\n22d of May, Puebla yielded submissively to General Worth, and Santa Anna\r\nretreated in the direction of the national capital, halting at San\r\nMartin Tesmalucan, and again at Ayotla, about twenty miles from Mexico.\r\nHere he learned that the city was in double fear of the immediate\r\nassault of the victorious Americans and of his supposed intention to\r\ndefend it within its own walls, a project which the people believed\r\nwould only result, in the present disastrous condition of affairs, in\r\nthe slaughter of its citizens and ruin of their property. The\r\ncommander-in-chief halted therefore at Ayotla, and playing dexterously\r\non the hopes and fears of the people in a long despatch addressed to the\r\nminister of war, he at length received the Presidential and popular\r\nsanction of his return to Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the nation at large had no one but Santa Anna, at that\r\nmoment of utter despair, in whose prestige and talents--in spite of\r\nall his misfortunes and defeats--it could rely for even the hope of\r\nescape from destruction, if not of ultimate victory.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Mexican nation had been thus sorely vexed by intestinal\r\ncommotions and foreign invasion an Extraordinary Constituent\r\nCongress--_Congreso Extraordinario Constituyente_--had been summoned\r\nand met in the capital, chiefly to revise the Constitution, or the\r\n\"Bases of Political Organization,\" of 1843, which had been superseded\r\nby the temporary adoption of the Federal Constitution of 1824,\r\naccording to the edict issued by Salas, under the direction of Santa\r\nAnna soon after that personage's return from exile. This Extraordinary\r\nCongress readopted the old Federal Constitution of 1824 without\r\naltering its terms, principles, or phraseology, and made such slight\r\nchanges as were deemed needful by an _Acta Constitutiva y de\r\nReformas_, containing thirty articles, which was sanctioned on the\r\n18th, and proclaimed on the 21st of May by Santa Anna, who had\r\nreassumed the Presidency. By this approval of the Federal System the\r\nExecutive entirely abandoned the Central policy for which he had so\r\nlong contended, but which, as we have seen in the 11th chapter, he no\r\nlonger believed, or feigned to believe, suitable for the nation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this submission to popular will, and apparent desire\r\nto deprive the Central Government of its most despotic prerogatives,\r\nthe conduct of Santa Anna did not save him entirely from the\r\nmachinations of his rivals or of intriguers. Much discontent was\r\nexpressed publicly and privately, and the President, accordingly\r\ntendered his resignation to Congress, intimating a desire to hasten\r\ninto private life! This stratagetic resignation was followed by the\r\nretiracy of General Rincon and General Bravo, who commanded the troops\r\nin the city. Acts of such vital significance upon the part of the\r\nablest men in the Republic, in an hour of exceeding danger, at once\r\nrecalled Congress and the people to their senses; and if they were\r\ndesigned, as they probably were, merely to throw the anarchists on\r\ntheir own resources and to show them their inefficiency at such an\r\nepoch, they seem to have produced the desired effect, for they placed\r\nSanta Anna and his partizans more firmly in power. Congress refused to\r\naccept his resignation. Unfortunate as he had been, it perhaps saw in\r\nhim the only commander who was capable in the exigency of controlling\r\nthe Mexican elements of resistance to the invaders, and he was thus\r\nenabled to form his plans, to collect men, means and munitions, and to\r\ncommence the system of fortifications around the capital. \"War to the\r\nknife,\" was still the rallying cry of the nation. The Congressional\r\nresolutions which had been passed on the 20th of April, immediately\r\nafter the battle of Cerro Gordo, proclaimed \"every individual a\r\ntraitor, let him be private person or public functionary, who should\r\nenter into treaties with the United States!\" Parties in the capital\r\nwere, nevertheless, not unanimous upon this subject. There were wise\r\nmen and patriots who foresaw the issue, and counselled the leaders to\r\ncome to honorable terms before the capital was assaulted. Others\r\ncraved the continuance of the war with the hope that its disasters\r\nwould destroy the individuals who conducted it to an unfortunate\r\nissue; and, among these, they saw that Santa Anna was finally pledged\r\nto abide that issue for weal or woe. Nor were politicians wanting in\r\nthe Republic who honestly looked to the prolongation of the conflict\r\nas a blessing to Mexico, believing that it would result in the\r\ncomplete subjugation of the whole country by American arms and its\r\nfinal annexation to our Union.\r\n\r\nIn June a coalition was formed at Lagos by deputies from Jalisco, San\r\nLuis Potosi, Zacatecas, Mexico and Querétaro, in which these States\r\ncombined for mutual defence; but, while they opposed peace, they\r\nresolved to act independently of the General Government. Many other\r\nparts of the republic looked on the scene with apathy. There was no\r\nlonger a revenue from foreign commerce. The products of the mines were\r\nsmuggled from the west coast in British vessels. Disorder and\r\nuncertainty prevailed every where in regard to the collection of the\r\nnational income from internal resources. Individuals, and not States,\r\ncorporations or municipalities, were now to be relied on for support;\r\nand, as the most important parts of the nation on the north and east\r\nwere virtually in the enemy's hands, the whole effort of the frail\r\nauthorities was confined to the protection of the capital. In the\r\nmidst of all this complication of confusion Santa Anna found that the\r\nelection for President, which was held by the States on the 15th of\r\nMay, had resulted unfavorably to his pretensions, and, by an adroit\r\nmovement, he prevailed on Congress to postpone the counting of the\r\nvotes from the 15th of June until January of the following year! All\r\nwho opposed his schemes of defence or resistance, were disposed of by\r\nbanishment, persecution or imprisonment, nor did he fail to establish\r\nso severe a censorship of the press, that, in July, it is believed,\r\nbut one paper was allowed to be issued in the capital, and that one,\r\nof course, entirely under his control. Throwing himself, like a true\r\nmilitary demagogue, publicly, if not at heart, at the head of popular\r\nfeeling in regard to the war with the United States, he adopted every\r\nmeasure and availed himself of every resource in his power to place\r\nthe city in a state of defence, and to fan the flame of resistance. In\r\nthe meanwhile the _guerilla_ forces, organized on the eastern coast,\r\nchiefly under a recreant clergyman named Jarauta, harassed every\r\nAmerican train and detachment on their way to the interior, and\r\nrendered the country insecure, until a fearful war of extermination\r\nwas adopted by our garrisons on the line.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States had, during the whole of this\r\nunfortunate contest, availed itself of every supposed suitable\r\noccasion to sound Mexico in relation to peace. In July, 1846, and in\r\nJanuary 1847, overtures were made to the national authorities and\r\nrejected; and again, early in the spring of 1847, as soon as the news\r\nof the defeat at Cerro Gordo reached Washington, Mr. Nicholas P. Trist\r\nwas despatched by the President upon a mission which it was hoped\r\nwould result in the restoration of international amity. The\r\ncommissioner reached Vera Cruz while the American army was advancing\r\ntowards the interior, but it was not until the forces reached Puebla,\r\nand General Scott had established his head quarters in that capital,\r\nthat he was enabled, through the intervention of the British Minister,\r\nto communicate with the Mexican government. The stringent terms of the\r\ndecree to which we have already alluded, of course, prevented Santa\r\nAnna, powerful as he was, from entertaining the proposals in the\r\nexisting state of the public mind, and, accordingly, he referred the\r\nsubject to Congress, a quorum of whose members was, with difficulty,\r\norganized. On the 13th of July, seventy-four assembled, and voted to\r\nstrip themselves of the responsibility by a resolution that it was the\r\nExecutive's duty to receive ministers, and to make treaties of peace\r\nand alliance, and that their functions were confined to the approval\r\nor disapproval of those treaties or alliances when submitted in due\r\nform under the constitution. But Santa Anna, still adhering to the\r\nletter of the mandatory decree passed after the battle of Cerro Gordo\r\nin April, alleged his legal incapacity to treat, and recommended the\r\nrepeal of the order, inasmuch as the American commissioner's letter\r\nwas courteous, and the dignity of Mexico required the return of a\r\nsuitable reply. Before the appeal could reach Congress, its members\r\nhad dispersed, foreseeing probably, the delicacy, if not danger, of\r\nthe dilemma in which they were about to be placed. Without a\r\nconstitution tribunal to relieve him from his position, the President\r\nfinally referred the matter to a council of general officers of the\r\narmy. This body, however, was quite as timorous as Congress, and\r\ndismissed the project by declaring that \"it was inexpedient to enter\r\ninto negotiations for peace, until another opportunity had been\r\nafforded Mexico to retrieve her fortunes in the field.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the negotiations that met the public eye, and are reported\r\nin the military and diplomatic despatches of the day; but there was a\r\nsecret correspondence, also, which denotes either the duplicity or\r\nstrategy of Santa Anna, and must be faithfully recorded. It seems that\r\nthe Mexican President, about the time that the public answer was\r\nproclaimed, sent private communications to the American head quarters\r\nat Puebla, intimating that if a million of dollars were placed at his\r\ndisposal, to be paid upon the conclusion of a treaty of peace, and ten\r\nthousand dollars were paid forthwith, he would appoint commissioners\r\nto negotiate! The proposal was received and discussed by General\r\nScott, Mr. Trist, and the leading officers, and being agreed to,\r\nthough not unanimously, the ten thousand dollars were disbursed from\r\nthe secret service money which Scott had at his disposal, and\r\ncommunications were opened in cypher, the key of which had been sent\r\nfrom Mexico. Intimations soon reached Puebla, from Santa Anna, that it\r\nwould be also necessary for the American army to advance and threaten\r\nthe Capital;--and, finally, another message was received, urging Scott\r\nto penetrate the valley and carry one of the outworks of the Mexican\r\nline of defences, in order to enable him to negotiate![68]\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of these proposals from the Mexican President, is very\r\nquestionable, and we are still in doubt whether he designed merely to\r\nprocrastinate and feel the temper of the Americans, or whether he was\r\nin reality angling for the splendid bribe of a million which he might\r\nappropriate privately, in the event of playing successfully upon the\r\nfeelings or fears of the masses. The attempt, however, proved\r\nabortive; and although both General Scott and Mr. Trist deemed it\r\nproper to entertain the proposal, the commander-in-chief never for a\r\nmoment delayed his military preparations for an advance with all the\r\nforce he could gather. Thus were the last efforts of the American\r\nauthorities in Mexico and Washington repulsed in the same demagogue\r\nspirit that hastened the rupture between the nations in the spring of\r\n1846, and nothing remained but to try again whether the sword was\r\nmightier than the pen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: See Major Ripley's History of the War with Mexico, p.\r\n148. et. seq.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (MAP OF THE VALLEY OF MEXICO WITH A PLAN OF THE MEXICAN\r\nDEFENCE And Line of U. S. ARMY'S OPERATIONS)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n    SCOTT AT PUEBLA--TAMPICO AND ORIZABA TAKEN--SCOTT's\r\n    ADVANCE--TOPOGRAPHY OF THE VALLEY OF MEXICO--ROUTES TO THE\r\n    CAPITAL--EL PEÑON--MEXICALZINGO--TEZCOCO--CHALCO--OUTER AND INNER\r\n    LINES AROUND THE CITY--SCOTT'S ADVANCE BY CHALCO--THE AMERICAN\r\n    ARMY AT SAN AGUSTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American forces, as we have stated, had concentrated at Puebla on\r\nthe main road to the city of Mexico, but their numbers had been\r\nthinned by desertion, disease and the return of many volunteers whose\r\nterm of service was over or nearly completed. Meanwhile the Mexican\r\narmy was increased by the arrival of General Valencia from San Luis\r\nwith five thousand troops and thirty-six pieces of artillery, and\r\nGeneral Alvarez with his Pinto Indians from the south and south-west,\r\nall of which, added to the regiments in the city and its immediate\r\nvicinity, swelled the numbers of the Mexican combatants to at least\r\ntwenty-five or thirty thousand. It was discovered that General Taylor\r\nwould not advance towards the south, and consequently the presence of\r\nValencia's men was of more importance at the point where the vital\r\nblow would probably be struck.\r\n\r\nWhilst the events we have related were occurring in the interior,\r\nCommodore Perry had swept down the coast and captured Tobasco, which,\r\nhowever, owing to its unhealthiness, was not long retained by the\r\nAmericans. But every other important port in the Gulf, from the Rio\r\nGrande to Yucatan, was in our possession, while an active blockade was\r\nmaintained before those in the Pacific. Colonel Bankhead subsequently,\r\noccupied Orizaba, and seized a large quantity of valuable public\r\nproperty. It had been the desire of the American authorities, from the\r\nearliest period of the war, to draw a large portion of the means for\r\nits support from Mexico, but the commanding Generals finding the\r\nsystem not only annoying to themselves but exasperating to the people\r\nand difficult of accomplishment, refrained from the exercise of a\r\nright which invaders have generally used in other countries. Our\r\nofficers, accordingly, paid for the supplies obtained from the\r\nnatives. Nor did they confine this principle of action to the\r\noperations of the military authorities alone whilst acting for the\r\narmy at large, but, wherever it was possible, restrained that spirit\r\nof private plunder and destruction which too commonly characterizes\r\nthe common soldier when flushed with victory over a weak but opulent\r\nfoe. When the ports of Mexico, however, had fallen into _our\r\npossession_ and the blockade was raised, they were at once opened to\r\nthe trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate than\r\nthose which had been collected by Mexico. The revenue, thus levied in\r\nthe form of a military contribution from Mexican citizens upon\r\narticles they consumed, was devoted to the use of our army and navy.\r\nIt was, in effect, the seizure of Mexican commercial duties and their\r\napplication to our necessary purposes, and thus far, only, was the\r\nnation compelled to contribute towards the expense of the war it had\r\nprovoked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in August, General Scott had been reinforced by the arrival of\r\nnew regiments at Puebla, and on the 7th of that month, he resolved to\r\nmarch upon the capital. Leaving a competent garrison in that city,\r\nunder the command of Colonel Childs, and a large number of sick and\r\nenfeebled men in the hospitals, he departed with about ten thousand\r\neager soldiers towards the renowned Valley of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn the same month, three hundred and twenty-eight years before,\r\nHernando Cortéz and his slender military train, departed from the\r\neastern coasts of Mexico, on the splendid errand of Indian conquest.\r\nAfter fighting two battles, with the Tlascalans who then dwelt in the\r\nneighborhood of Puebla, and with the Cholulans whose solitary\r\npyramid,--a grand and solemn monument of the past,--still rises\r\nmajestically from the beautiful plain, he slowly toiled across the\r\nsteeps of the grand volcanic sierra which divides the valleys and hems\r\nin the plain of Mexico. Patiently winding up its wooded sides and\r\npassing the forests of its summit, the same grand panoramic scene lay\r\nspread out in sunshine at the feet of the American General that three\r\ncenturies before had greeted the eager and longing eyes of the\r\ngreatest Castilian soldier who ever trod the shores of America.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the military movements which ended the drama of\r\nthe Mexican war, it will be necessary for us to describe the\r\ntopography of the valley with some minuteness, although it is not\r\ndesigned to recount, in detail, all the events and personal heroism of\r\nthe battles that ensued. This would require infinitely more room than\r\nwe can afford, and we are, accordingly, spared the discussion of many\r\ncircumstances which concern the merits, the opinions, and the acts of\r\nvarious commanders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking downward towards the west from the shoulders of the lofty\r\nelevations which border the feet of the volcano of Popocatepetl, the\r\nspectator beholds a remarkable and perfect basin, enclosed on every\r\nside by mountains whose height varies from two hundred to ten thousand\r\nfeet from its bottom. The form of this basin may be considered nearly\r\ncircular, the diameter being about fifty miles. As the eye descends to\r\nthe levels below, it beholds every variety of scenery. Ten extinct\r\nvolcanoes rear their ancient cones and craters in the southern part of\r\nthe valley, multitudes of lesser hills and elevations break the\r\nevenness of the plain, while, interspersed among its eight hundred and\r\nthirty square miles of arable land and along the shores of its six\r\nlakes of Chalco, Xochimilco, Tezcoco, San Cristoval, Xaltocan and\r\nZumpango, stretching across the valley from north to south, are seen\r\nthe white walls of ten populous cities and towns. In front of the\r\nobserver, about forty miles to the west, is the capital of the\r\nRepublic, while the main road thither descends rapidly from the last\r\nmountain slopes, at the Venta de Cordova, until it is lost in the\r\nplain on the margin of Lake Chalco near the Hacienda of Buena Vista.\r\nFrom thence to the town of Ayotla it sweeps along the plain between a\r\nmoderate elevation on the north and the lake of Chalco on the south.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August, General Scott, after crossing the mountains,\r\nconcentrated his forces in the valley. General Twiggs encamped with\r\nhis division in advance, on the direct road, at Ayotla, near the\r\nnorthern shore of Lake Chalco; General Quitman was stationed with his\r\ntroops a short distance in the rear; General Worth occupied the town\r\nof Chalco on the western shore of its lake, while General Pillow\r\nbrought up the rear by an encampment near Worth.\r\n\r\nThis position of the army commanded four routes to the capital whose\r\ncapture was the coveted prize. The first of these, as well as the\r\nshortest and most direct, was the main post road which reaches the\r\ncity by the gate or _garita_ of San Lazaro on the east. After passing\r\nAyotla this road winds round the foot of an extinct volcanic hill for\r\nfive miles when it approaches the sedgy shores and marshes of Lake\r\nTezcoco on the north, thence it passes over a causeway built across an\r\narm of Tezcoco for two miles, and, by another causeway of seven miles\r\nfinally strikes the city. The road is good, level, perfectly open and\r\ncomfortable for ordinary travelling, but the narrow land between the\r\nlakes of Chalco and Tezcoco, compressed still more by broken hills and\r\nrocks, admits the most perfect military defence. At the end of the\r\nfirst causeway over the arm of Tezcoco which we have just described,\r\nis the abrupt oblong volcanic hill styled El Peñon, four hundred and\r\nfifty feet above the level of the lake, its top accessible in the\r\ndirection of Ayotla at only one point, and surrounded by water except\r\non the west towards Mexico. It is a natural fortress; yet Santa Anna\r\nhad not neglected to add to its original strength, and to seize it as\r\nthe eastern key of his defences. Three lines of works were thrown up,\r\nat the base, at the brow, and on the summit of the eminence. The works\r\nat the base, completely encircling El Peñon, consisted of a ditch\r\nfifteen feet wide, four and a half feet deep, and a parapet fifteen\r\nfeet thick whose slope was raised eight and a half feet above the\r\nbottom of the ditch. Ample breastworks formed the other two lines of\r\nthe bristling tiara. In addition to this, the causeway across the arm\r\nof Tezcoco, immediately in front, had been cut and was defended by a\r\nbattery of two guns, while the fire from all the works, mounting about\r\nsixty pieces, swept the whole length of the causeway.\r\n\r\nThe second road to the capital was by Mexicalzingo. After leaving\r\nAyotla the highway continues along the main post road for six or seven\r\nmiles and then deflects southwardly towards the village of Santa\r\nMaria, whence it pursues its way westwardly towards Istapalapan, but,\r\njust before reaching Mexicalzingo, it crosses a marsh formed by the\r\nwaters of Lake Xochimilco, on a causeway nearly a mile long. This\r\napproach, dangerous as it was by its natural impediments, was also\r\nprotected by extensive field works which made it almost as perilous\r\nfor assault as the Peñon.\r\n\r\nThe third route lay through Tezcoco. Leaving Chalco and the Hacienda\r\nof Buena Vista, it strikes off from the main route directly north, and\r\npassing through the town of Tezcoco, it sweeps westwardly around the\r\nshores of the lake of that name until it crosses the stone dyke of San\r\nCristoval, near the lake and town of that name; thence, by a road\r\nleading almost directly south for fifteen miles, through the sacred\r\ntown of Guadalupe Hidalgo, it enters the capital. It is an agreeable\r\nroute through a beautiful country, yet extremely circuitous though\r\nfree from all natural or artificial obstacles, until it reaches\r\nSantiago Zacualco within two miles of Guadalupe. But at the period of\r\nScott's invasion of the valley, General Valencia, with the troops that\r\nwere afterwards convened at Contreras, was stationed at Tezcoco,\r\neither for the purpose of observation, or to induce an attack in that\r\nquarter, and thus to draw our forces into a snare on the northern\r\nroute, or to fall on the rear of the American commander if he attacked\r\nEl Peñon, or advanced by the way of Mexicalzingo. At Santiago\r\nZacualco, west of the lake and on the route, formidable works were\r\nthrown up to defend the entire space between the western shore of lake\r\nTezcoco and the mountains; while on the road to Querétaro, at the\r\nmountain pass north of Tenepantla, other defences were erected, so as\r\nto screen the country on all sides of the group of hills which lies\r\nwest of the lakes of Tezcoco and San Cristoval and north of the town\r\nof Guadalupe Hidalgo.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last advance to the city was that which turned to the\r\nsouth from the Hacienda of Buena Vista, and passing by the town of\r\nChalco, led along the narrow land intervening between the shores of\r\nlake Chalco and the first steeps of the mountains forming the southern\r\nrim of the valley, until it fell at right angles, at Tlalpam or San\r\nAgustin de las Cuevas, into the main road from the city of Mexico\r\ntowards the southern States of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAll these routes were boldly reconnoitred by the brave engineers\r\naccompanying the American army, and, where they could not extend their\r\npersonal observations, the officers obtained from the people of the\r\ncountry, information upon which subsequent events proved that they were\r\njustified in relying. From the knowledge thus gained as to the route\r\nsouth of the lake of Chalco, they were induced to believe, although it\r\nwas rough, untravelled, difficult, and narrowly hemmed in between the\r\nlake and the mountains, yet that the long and narrow defile, which was\r\nopen to resistance at many points, was not sufficiently obstructed or\r\nfortified to prevent our passage. All the routes on the lower lands, it\r\nshould also be remembered, were liable to increased difficulties from\r\nthe deluging rains prevailing at this season on the highlands of Mexico,\r\nand which sometimes convert the highways and their borders, for many\r\nleagues, into almost impassable lagunes.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna and his engineers had probably supposed that this southern\r\nroute would not be adopted, but a reasonable explanation of his\r\nconduct is given by one of the most competent commentators upon the\r\nvalley of Mexico and the march of the American army.[69] \"When an\r\nenemy is in front of El Peñon, the communication between it and troops\r\non the other routes _is only by way of the city of Mexico itself_; in\r\nother words, the American troops being at Ayotla, General Santa Anna's\r\nforces at El Peñon were one day's march distant from those at\r\nMexicalzingo, three from those under General Valencia, and would have\r\nbeen about four days' march from troops thrown forward on the Chalco\r\nroute. Fords on these different routes were by no means within\r\nsupporting distances of each other. Holding the position that General\r\nScott then did, it would have required, of an equal enemy, four times\r\nhis own force, to have opposed successfully his further advance. The\r\nMexican forces were not numerically equal to this, and, accordingly,\r\nthey were concentrated at the threatened point. It is evident that as\r\nlong as the American troops were in front of El Peñon, the enemy\r\n_necessarily_ held to their position. In moving off, the former could\r\ngain one day the start. This brought the only difficult parts of the\r\nChalco route actually nearer General Scott than the Mexican chief. If\r\nto this we add the delay necessary in moving heavy artillery and\r\nbreaking up from a fortified position, it would seem that, instead of\r\noversight, it was rather impossible for General Santa Anna to meet our\r\nforces sooner than he did.\"\r\n\r\nThe description of the various routes to the capital has necessarily\r\nacquainted the reader with the important Mexican defences on the\r\nnorth, the east, and the north-east of the capital, both by military\r\nworks hastily thrown up after Santa Anna's retreat from Cerro Gordo,\r\nand by the encampment of large bodies of soldiery. We thus, already\r\nknow a part of the external line of defences at El Peñon,\r\nMexicalzingo, Tezcoco, Santiago Zacualco, and the Pass north of\r\nTenepantla. But in addition to these, there are others that must be\r\nnoticed on the south and west of the capital, which it should always\r\nbe recollected is situated in the lap of the valley, but near the\r\nwestern edge of the gigantic rim of mountains.\r\n\r\nAlong the Chalco route there were no more fortifications, but west of\r\nlakes Chalco and Xochimilco, a line of entrenchments had been\r\ncommenced, connecting the fortified _hacienda_, or massive stone\r\nplantation house of San Antonio, about six miles south of the city,\r\nwith the town of Mexicalzingo. West of this _hacienda_, the Pedregal,\r\na vast, broken field of lava, spread out along the edge of the main\r\nroad, and skirting it to San Agustin, extended high upon the mountain\r\nslopes still further west near San Angel and Contreras, whose\r\nneighboring fields were cut into deep ravines and barrancas by the\r\nwash from the declivities. The Pedregal was a most formidable obstacle\r\nin the march or man[oe]uvres of an army. But few levels of arable land\r\nwere found among its rocky wastes. It admitted the passage of troops\r\nat but few points, and was entirely impracticable for cavalry or\r\nartillery, except by a single mule-path.[70] North of San Angel and\r\nthe edge of the Pedregal, at the distance of about four miles, rose\r\nthe solitary hill and castle of Chapultepec, which had been amply\r\nprepared for defence; and still further north on the same line,\r\nfrowned the stern ridges of the _sierra_, cut by barrancas and\r\nprofound dells, until the ring of the outer series of military works\r\nwas thus finally united at the pass beyond Tenepantla. But inside of\r\nthis formidable barrier of outworks, nearer the city, another line of\r\nfortifications had been prepared to dispute the American march. The\r\nfirst, and perhaps the most important of these, was at Churubusco, a\r\nscattered village lying midway between San Agustin and the city of\r\nMexico, directly on the road, at a spot where the stream or rivulet of\r\nChurubusco runs eastwardly from a point on the road from San Angel to\r\nthe capital, towards the lake of Xochimilco. The sides of the water\r\ncourse were planted with the prickly maguey, and one of the most\r\nwestern buildings in the village was a strong massive stone convent,\r\nwhose walls had been cut for musketry, and whose parapets, azotéas or\r\nflat roofs, and windows, all afforded suitable positions for soldiery.\r\nLarge quantities of ammunition were stored within the edifice. The\r\nenclosure of the church and convent was defended by about two thousand\r\nmen, and mounted seven guns, while, towards the east was a beautiful,\r\nsolid and scientifically constructed tête de pont which covered the\r\nbridge over the stream by which the road led to the capital. In this\r\nwork three heavy guns were mounted, while the neighborhood is said to\r\nhave swarmed with troops.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the garita or gate of San Lazaro, which was\r\nthe entrance to the city by the main road from the east, passing the\r\nhill and fortification of El Peñon. This garita was strengthened by\r\nstrong works on the road, with platforms and embrasures for heavy\r\ncannon, which would have swept the path, while the marshes on the\r\nsouth were protected by redoubts and lunettes extending to the garita\r\nor entrance of La Candelaria on the canal from Xochimilco. North of\r\nSan Lazaro strong works hemmed in the city to the garita of\r\nPeralvillo, and connected with defences and fortified houses reaching\r\nto the garita of Santiago. Other advanced works were begun in that\r\nquarter, while the ground in front of the main line was cut into\r\n_troux de loups_.\r\n\r\nOn the west of the city are the garitas of San Cosmé and Belen. \"Works\r\nhad been commenced to connect that of San Cosmé, the most northerly of\r\nthe two, with that of Santiago, and the nature of the country and of\r\nthe buildings, formed obstructions to any advance between San Cosmé\r\nand Belen. Belen was defended principally by the citadel of Mexico, a\r\nsquare bastioned work with wet ditches, immediately inside the garita.\r\nBarricades had also been commenced; but the great obstacle to an\r\nentrance by either garita, was presented in the rock and castle of\r\nChapultepec, two miles south-west of the city. From this hill two\r\naqueducts extend to the capital, the one, north-east, in a direct line\r\nto Belen, and the other, north, to the suburb of San Cosmé, where,\r\nturning at right angles, it continued onward and entered at the\r\ngarita. The roads from the west ran along the sides of the aqueducts.\r\nTwo roads enter the city from the south, between the garita of San\r\nAntonio and Belen, one at Belen and the other at the garita of El niño\r\nPerdido, neither of these roads have branches to the Acapulco road\r\nsouth of the Pedregal and the Hacienda of San Antonio, and, therefore,\r\nhad been left comparatively unfortified.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThese defences, overlooked by the lofty sierras and the barrancas\r\nwhich broke their feet, hemmed in the capital, and the Mexicans\r\nreadily imagined that they could not be turned by an army marching\r\nfrom the east, so as to reach the city on the west, except by a\r\ntedious circuit which would allow them time to complete their\r\nprotective works in that quarter. The east had claimed their chief and\r\nmost natural attention, and thus the south and the west became\r\nunquestionably their weakest points.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch were the Mexican lines, natural and artificial, around the\r\ncapital in the valley in the middle of August, 1847, and such was the\r\nposition of the American troops in front of them. The Mexicans\r\nnumbered then, with all their levies, probably more than thirty\r\nthousand fighting men, while the Americans did not count more than ten\r\nthousand--under arms at all points. The invaders had prepared as well\r\nas circumstances admitted, and their _materiel_ for assault or siege\r\nhad been gathered carefully, and transported slowly into the interior,\r\nthrough the country intervening between Vera Cruz and Puebla, every\r\ntrain being usually attacked by guerillas, and fighting its way boldly\r\nthrough the most dangerous passes.\r\n\r\nThe equipments of the Mexicans, except the weapons saved from the\r\nwreck of former battles, had been chiefly prepared at the cannon\r\nfoundries and powder factories of the country, and it is quite amazing\r\nto notice how completely a great exigency brought forth the latent\r\nenergies of the people, teaching them what they might ordinarily\r\neffect, if guided by a spirit of industry and progress. Under the most\r\ndisheartening depression, but fired by the stimulus of despair, by an\r\noverpowering sense of patriotic duty, and by religious enthusiasm\r\nwhich had been excited by the crusading address of the clergy of San\r\nLuis Potosi, issued in the month of April, they manifested in their\r\nlast moments, a degree of zeal, calmness, and foresight that will\r\nforever redound to their credit on the page of history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Mexican preparations for defence were not, of course, as completely\r\nknown to the Americans as we now describe them. Through spies, scouts\r\nand reconnoisances of our engineers, some of the exterior, and even of\r\nthe interior lines were ascertained with tolerable accuracy; but\r\nsufficient was known to satisfy General Scott that of all the\r\napproaching routes to the capital, that which led along the southern\r\nshores of lake Chalco was the only one he ought to adopt.[72]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 15th of August, the movement was commenced in the\r\nreverse order from that in which the army had entered the valley from\r\nPuebla. Worth's division passing Pillow's, led the advance, Pillow and\r\nQuitman followed, while Twiggs' brought up the rear. Scott took his\r\nposition with Pillow, so as to communicate easily with all parts of\r\nthe army. Water transportation, to some extent, had been obtained by\r\nGeneral Worth at Chalco, by the siezure of market boats which plied\r\nbetween that place and the capital. When Twiggs moved he was assailed\r\nby Alvarez and his Pintos, but soon drove them off, while the advance\r\ncolumns, after passing San Gregorio, were frequently assailed by the\r\nenemy's light troops in their front, and harassed and impeded by\r\nditches that had been hastily cut across the road, or by rocks rolled\r\ndown from the mountains. These obstacles necessarily consumed time,\r\nbut the simple-minded Indians of the neighborhood, who had just been\r\ncompelled by the Mexicans to throw the impediments in the Americans'\r\nway, were perhaps more easily induced to aid in clearing the path for\r\nthe invaders, than their ancestors had been in the days of Cortéz. On\r\nthe afternoon of the 17th, Worth, with the advance, reached San\r\nAgustin, at the foot of the mountains, and at the intersection of the\r\nsouthern road from Mexico to Cuernavaca and Acapulco--a point whose\r\ntopography we have already described;--and, on the 18th, the rear\r\ndivision entered the town.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Santa Anna discovered Scott's advance by the Chalco route,\r\nand that the attack on Mexico would be made from the south instead of\r\nthe east, he at once perceived that it was useless to attack the\r\nAmerican rear, whilst passing the defiles between the lake and the\r\nmountains even if he could possibly come up with it, and consequently,\r\nthat it was best for him to quit his head quarters at El Peñon, while\r\nhe also recalled General Valencia with the most of the troops at\r\nTezcoco and at Mexicalzingo, which were no longer menaced by the foe.\r\nSanta Anna himself, established his quarters at the fortified hacienda\r\nof San Antonio, and ordered Valencia to march his whole division,\r\ncavalry, infantry and artillery, to the town of San Angel and\r\nCoyoacan, so as to cover the whole west and centre of the valley in\r\nfront of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: See the admirable Map and Memoir of Lieutenant M.

The plans of\r\nboth generals in chief were well made; but the blunders and obstinacy\r\nof the Mexican second in command disconcerted Santa Anna's desired\r\ncombination, and ultimately opened the ground to the American advance\r\nwith more ease than was anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe will sketch rapidly the military value of the arena upon which the\r\ncombatants stood on the 18th of August, 1847.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine ourselves beside General Scott, standing on one of the\r\nelevations above the town of San Agustin de las Cuevas, at the base of\r\nthe southern mountain barrier of the valley, and looking northward\r\ntowards the capital. Directly in front, leading to the city, is the\r\nmain road, the left or western side of which, even from the gate of\r\nSan Agustin to the Hacienda of San Antonio, and thence westwardly to\r\nSan Angel, forms, together with the bases of the southern and western\r\nmountains about St. Geronimo and Contreras, a vast basin, ten or\r\ntwelve square miles in extent, covered with the Pedregal or the field\r\nof broken lava which we have already mentioned. This mass of jagged\r\nvolcanic matter, we must remember, was at that time barely passable\r\nwith difficulty for infantry, and altogether impassable for cavalry or\r\nartillery, save by a single mule path. North, beyond the fortified\r\n_hacienda_ and headquarters of Santa Anna at San Antonio, the country\r\nopened. A line of field works, the lake of Xochimilco, a few\r\ncultivated farms, and vast flooded meadows, were on its right to the\r\neast, but from the _hacienda_, a road branches off to the west,\r\nleading around the northern edge of the _Pedregal_ or lava field\r\nthrough Coyoacan and San Angel, whence it deflects southwardly to\r\nContreras. The main road, however, continues onward, northwardly, from\r\nthe hacienda of San Antonio, until it crosses the Churubusco river at\r\nthe strong fortification we have described. Beyond Churubusco the\r\nhighway leads straight to the gate of San Antonio Abad, whence a work\r\nhad been thrown north-westwardly towards the citadel. The city of\r\nMexico, built on the bed of an ancient lake, was on a perfect level,\r\nnor were there any commanding or protecting elevations of importance\r\naround it within two or three miles, and the first of these, beyond\r\nthis limit, were chiefly on the north and west.\r\n\r\nThus, General Santa Anna, in front, on the main road to the city, at\r\nthe massive fortified _hacienda_ of San Antonio, blocked up the\r\nhighway in that direction, protected on his right by the barrier of\r\nthe Pedregal; and by the lake of Xochimilco, the field works, and the\r\nflooded country on his left. General Valencia had been placed by him\r\nwith his troops at San Angel, on the western edge of the valley, and\r\nat the village of Coyoacan, a little further east in the lap of the\r\nvalley, on roads communicating easily with his position at San\r\nAntonio, while they commanded the approaches to the city by the\r\ncircuitous path of the Pedregal around the edge of the valley from San\r\nAgustin de las Cuevas, through Contreras or Padierna. Valencia and\r\nSanta Anna were consequently within supporting distance of each other;\r\nand in their rear, in front of the city, were the fortifications of\r\nChurubusco. General Scott, with the whole American army was,\r\ntherefore, apparently hemmed in between the lakes and the Pedregal on\r\nhis flanks; the Mexican fortifications and army in front; and the\r\nsteep mountains towards Cuernavaca in his rear. He was obliged,\r\naccordingly, either to retreat by the defiles through which he had\r\nadvanced from Chalco,--to climb the steeps behind him and pass them to\r\nthe _tierra caliente_,--to force the position in front at the hacienda\r\nof San Antonio,--or to burst the barrier of the Pedregal on his left,\r\nand, sweeping round the rim of the valley, to advance towards the\r\ncapital through the village of San Angel. Such were some of the\r\ndangers and difficulties that menaced Scott on his arrival at San\r\nAgustin. He was in the heart of the enemy's country, in front of a\r\ncapital aroused by pride, patriotism and despair, and possessing all\r\nthe advantages of an accurate knowledge of the ground on which it\r\nstood, or by which it was surrounded. Scott, on the other hand, like\r\nthe mariner in storm on a lee shore, was obliged to feel his way along\r\nthe dangerous coast with the lead, and could not advance with that\r\nperfect confidence which is ever the surest harbinger of success.\r\n\r\nThe reconnoissances of the American engineers which had been pushed\r\nboldly, in front, on the main road, to the north, by the hacienda of\r\nSan Antonio, soon disclosed the difficulty in that direction. But\r\namong the mass of information which the American General received at\r\nPuebla, his engineers learned that _there was_ a pathway through this\r\nPedregal whose route had been indicated by the spies with sufficient\r\ndistinctness and certainty to justify a hope that he might be able to\r\nrender it practicable for his whole army, and, thus, enable him to\r\nturn the right flank of the Mexicans' strongest positions. There is no\r\ndoubt, as subsequent events demonstrated, that the ground in the\r\nneighborhood of Contreras, where the road descends from the mountains\r\nand barrancas towards San Angel was of great importance to the\r\nMexicans in the defence of the various modes of access to the city,\r\nand it is unquestionable that a strong post should have been placed in\r\nthat quarter to cripple the American advance. It is stated by Mexican\r\nwriters, that General Mendoza, with two members of his topographical\r\ncorps had reconnoitred this route and pass, and pronounced it\r\n\"absolutely indefensible.\" It is probable, therefore, that no general\r\naction, involving the fortunes of a division, or of a large mass of\r\nthe Mexican army, should have been risked among the ravines between\r\nthe mountains and the Pedregal near Contreras; yet we do not believe\r\nthat it should have been left by Santa Anna without a force capable of\r\nmaking a staunch resistance.\r\n\r\nWe are now acquainted with the ground, and with the positions of the two\r\narmies. Scott's plan was to force a passage by either or both of the two\r\nadits to the levels of the valley in front of the city, while Santa\r\nAnna's, according to his manifesto dated _subsequently_ on the 23d of\r\nAugust, was to have made a concerted retrograde movement with his\r\ntroops, and to have staked the fortunes of the capital on a great\r\nbattle, in which all his fresh, enthusiastic, and unharmed troops would\r\nhave been brought into a general action against the comparatively small\r\nAmerican army, upon an open ground where he would have had full\r\nopportunity to use and man[oe]uvre infantry, cavalry and artillery.\r\n\r\nBut this plan was disconcerted at first, and probably destroyed, both\r\nin its _materiel_ and _morale_, by the gross disobedience of General\r\nValencia, who forgot as a soldier, that there can never be two\r\ncommanders in the field. Valencia, apparently resolving to seize the\r\nfirst opportunity to attack the Americans, in spite of the reported\r\nuntenable character of the ground about Padierna or Contreras, left\r\nhis quarters at Coyoacan and San Angel, and advanced, without\r\nconsulting his commander, to Contreras, upon whose heights he threw up\r\nan entrenched camp! As soon as Santa Anna learned this fact, he\r\nordered the vain and reckless officer to retire, but finding him\r\nobstinately resolute in his insubordination, the commander-in-chief\r\nsuffered him, in direct opposition to his own opinion, to remain and\r\nto charge himself with the whole responsibility of the consequences.\r\nThus, if Scott advanced upon the main road, he would meet only Santa\r\nAnna in front, and the efficiency of Valencia's force, on his left\r\nflank, would be comparatively destroyed. If he conquered Valencia,\r\nhowever, at Contreras, after passing the Pedregal, he would rout a\r\nwhole division of the veterans of the north--the remnants of San Luis\r\nand Angostura,--while the remainder of the army, composed of recent\r\nlevies and raw troops, disciplined for the occasion, would, in all\r\nlikelihood, fall an easy prey to the eager Americans.\r\n\r\nThe reconnoissances of the American army were now completed both towards\r\nSan Antonio over the main northern road, and towards Padierna or\r\nContreras over the southern and south-western edge of the Pedregal. That\r\nbrave and accomplished engineer, Captain--now Colonel Robert E. Lee--had\r\ndone the work on the American left across the fields of broken lava, and\r\nbeing convinced that a road could be opened, if needed, for the whole\r\narmy and its trains, Scott resolved forthwith to advance.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August, General Pillow's division was commanded to open\r\nthe way, and advancing carefully, bravely and laboriously over the\r\nworst portion of the pass,--cutting its road as it moved onward,--it\r\narrived about one o'clock in the afternoon at a point amid the ravines\r\nand barrancas near Padierna or Contreras where the new road could only\r\nbe continued under the direct fire of twenty-two pieces of Mexican\r\nartillery, most of which were of large calibre. These guns were in a\r\nstrong entrenched camp, surrounded by every advantage of ground and by\r\nlarge bodies of infantry and cavalry, reinforced from the city, over\r\nan excellent road beyond the volcanic field. Pillow's and Twiggs's\r\nforce, with all its officers on foot, picking a way along the Mexican\r\nfront and extending towards the road from the city and the enemy's\r\nleft, advanced to dislodge the foe. Captain Magruder's field battery\r\nof twelve and six-pounders, and Lieut. Callender's battery of mountain\r\nhowitzers and rockets, were also pushed forward with great difficulty\r\nwithin range of the Mexican fortifications, and, thus, a stationary\r\nbattle raged until night fell drearily on the combatants amid a cold\r\nrain which descended in torrents. Wet, chilled, hungry and sleepless,\r\nboth armies passed a weary time of watching until early the next\r\nmorning, when a movement was made by the Americans which resulted in a\r\ntotal rout of Valencia's forces. Firing at a long distance against an\r\nentrenched camp was worse than useless on such a ground, and although\r\nGeneral Smith's and Colonel Riley's brigades, supported by Generals\r\nPierce's and Cadwallader's, had been under a heavy fire of artillery\r\nand musketry for more than three hours along the almost impassable\r\nravine in front and to the left of the Mexican camp, yet so little had\r\nbeen effected in destroying the position that the main reliance for\r\nsuccess was correctly judged to be in an assault at close quarters.\r\nThe plan had been arranged in the night by Brigadier General Persifer\r\nF. Smith, and was sanctioned by General Scott, to whom it was\r\ncommunicated through the indefatigable diligence of Captain Lee, of\r\nthe Engineers.\r\n\r\nAt 3 o'clock A. M. of the 20th August, the movement commenced on the\r\nrear of the enemy's camp, led by Colonel Riley and followed\r\nsuccessively by Cadwallader's and Smith's brigades, the whole force\r\nbeing commanded by General Smith.\r\n\r\nThe march was rendered tedious by rain, mud and darkness; but, about\r\nsun rise, Riley reached an elevation behind the Mexicans, whence he\r\nthrew his men upon the works, and, storming the entrenchments, planted\r\nhis flag upon them in seventeen minutes. Meanwhile Cadwallader brought\r\non the general assault by crossing the deep ravine in front and\r\npouring into the work and upon the fugitives, frequent volleys of\r\ndestructive musketry. Smith's own brigade under the temporary command\r\nof Major Dimick, discovered, opposite and outside the work, a long\r\nline of Mexican cavalry drawn up in support, and by a charge against\r\nthe flank, routed the horse completely, while General Shields held\r\nmasses of cavalry, supported by artillery, in check below him, and\r\ncaptured multitudes who fled from above.\r\n\r\nIt was a rapid and brilliant feat of arms. Scott,--the skilful and\r\nexperienced General of the field,--doubts in his despatch whether a\r\nmore brilliant or decisive victory is to be found on record, when the\r\ndisparity of numbers, the nature of the ground, the artificial\r\ndefences, and the fact that the Americans accomplished their end\r\nwithout artillery or cavalry, are duly and honestly considered. All\r\nour forces did not number more than 4,500 rank and file, while the\r\nMexicans maintained, at least, six thousand on the field, and double\r\nthat number in reserve under Santa Anna, who had advanced to support\r\nbut probably seeing that it was not a spot for his theory of a general\r\naction, and that an American force intervened, declined aiding his\r\ndisobedient officer. The Mexicans lost about 700 killed, 813\r\nprisoners, including 4 Generals among 88 officers. Twenty-two pieces\r\nof brass ordnance, thousands of small arms and accoutrements, many\r\ncolors and standards, large stores of ammunition, 700 pack mules, and\r\nnumbers of horses fell into the hands of the victors.\r\n\r\nThe rage of Santa Anna against Valencia knew no bounds. He ordered him\r\nto be shot wherever found; but the defeated chief fled precipitately\r\ntowards the west beyond the mountains, and for a long time lay in\r\nconcealment until the storm of private and public indignation had\r\npassed. The effect of this battle, resulting in the loss of the\r\nveterans of the north, was disastrous not only in the city, but to the\r\n_morale_ of the remaining troops of the main division under Santa\r\nAnna. It certainly demonstrated the importance of Padierna or\r\nContreras as a military point of defence; but it unquestionably proved\r\nthat the works designed to maintain it should have been differently\r\nplanned and placed at a much earlier day, after mature deliberation by\r\nskilful engineers. The hasty decision and work of Valencia, made\r\nwithout preconcert or sanction of the General-in-chief, and in total\r\nviolation of his order of battle, followed by the complete destruction\r\nof the entire division of the northern army, could only result in\r\nfinal disaster.\r\n\r\nWhilst the battle of Contreras was raging early in the day, brigades\r\nfrom Worth's and Quitman's divisions had been advanced to support the\r\ncombatants; but before they arrived on the field the post was\r\ncaptured, and they were, accordingly, ordered to return to their late\r\npositions. Worth, advanced from San Agustin, in front of San Antonio,\r\nwas now in better position, for a road to the rear of the _hacienda_\r\nhad been opened by forcing the pass of Contreras. Moving from\r\nContreras or Padierna through San Angel and Coyoacan, Pillow's and\r\nTwiggs's divisions would speedily be able to attack it from the north,\r\nwhile Worth, advancing from the south, might unquestionably force the\r\nposition. Accordingly while Pillow and Twiggs were advanced, General\r\nScott reached Coyoacan, about two miles, by a cross road, in the rear\r\nof the hacienda of San Antonio. From Coyoacan he despatched Pillow to\r\nattack the rear of San Antonio, while a reconnoissance was made of\r\nChurubusco, on the main road, and an attack of the place ordered to be\r\neffected by Twiggs with one of his brigades and Captain Taylor's field\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pierce was next despatched, under the guidance of Captain Lee,\r\nby a road to the left, to attack the enemy's right and rear in order\r\nto favor the movement on the Convent of Churubusco and cut off retreat\r\nto the capital. And, finally, Shields, with the New York and South\r\nCarolina volunteers, was ordered to follow Pierce and to command the\r\nleft wing. The battle now raged from the right to the left of our\r\nwhole line. All the movements had been made with the greatest\r\nrapidity and enthusiasm. Not a moment was lost in pressing the victory\r\nafter the fall of Contreras. Shouting Americans and rallying Mexicans\r\nwere spread over every field. Every one was employed; and, in truth,\r\nthere was ample work to do, for even the commander-in-chief of our\r\nforces was left without a reserve or an escort, and had to advance for\r\nsafety close in Twiggs's rear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, about an hour earlier, Worth, by a skilful and daring\r\nmovement upon the enemy's front and right at the hacienda of San\r\nAntonio, had turned and forced that formidable point whose garrison no\r\ndoubt was panic struck by the victory of Contreras. The enterprise was\r\nnobly achieved. Colonel Clarke's brigade, conducted by the engineers\r\nMason and Hardcastle, found a practicable path through the Pedregal\r\nwest of the road, and, by a wide sweep, came out upon the main\r\ncauseway to the capital. At this point the three thousand men of the\r\nMexican garrison at San Antonio, were met in retreat, and cut by\r\nClarke in their very centre;--one portion being driven off towards\r\nDolores on the right, and the other upon Churubusco in the direct line\r\nof the active operations of the Americans. Whilst this brave feat of\r\nout-flanking was performed, Colonel Garland, Major Galt, Colonel\r\nBelton, and Lieutenant Colonel Duncan advanced to the front attack of\r\nSan Antonio, and rushing rapidly on the flying enemy, took one General\r\nprisoner, and seized a large quantity of public property, ammunition\r\nand the five deserted guns.\r\n\r\nThus fell the two main keys of the valley, and thus did all the\r\ndivisions of the American army at length reach the open and\r\ncomparatively unobstructed plains of the valley.\r\n\r\nWorth soon reunited his division on the main straight road to the\r\ncapital, and was joined by General Pillow, who, advancing from Coyoacan\r\nto attack the rear of San Antonio, as we have already related, soon\r\nperceived that the hacienda had fallen, and immediately turned to the\r\nleft, through a broken country of swamps and ditches, in order to share\r\nin the attack on CHURUBUSCO. And here, it was felt on all sides, that\r\nthe last stand must be made by Mexico in front of her capital.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet or scattered houses of Churubusco, formed a strong military\r\nposition on the borders of the stream which crosses the highway, and,\r\nbesides the fortified and massive convent of San Pablo, it was guarded\r\nby a _tête de pont_ with regular bastions and curtains at the head of\r\na bridge over which the road passes from the _hacienda_ of San Antonio\r\nto the city. The stream was a defence;--the nature of the adjacent\r\ncountry was a defence;--and here the fragments of the Mexican\r\narmy,--cavalry, artillery and infantry, had been collected from every\r\nquarter,--panic stricken, it is true,--yet apparently resolved to\r\ncontest the passage of the last outwork of importance in front of the\r\n_garita_ of San Antonio Abad.\r\n\r\nWhen Worth and Pillow reached this point, Twiggs had already been\r\nsometime hotly engaged in attacking the embattled convent. The two\r\nadvancing Generals immediately began to man[oe]uvre closely upon the\r\n_tête de pont_, which was about four hundred and fifty yards east of\r\nthe convent, where Twiggs still earnestly plied the enemy. Various\r\nbrigades and regiments under Cadwallader, Lieutenant Colonel Smith,\r\nGarland, Clark, Major White and Lieutenant Colonel Scott continued to\r\npress onward towards the _tête de pont_, until by gradual\r\nencroachments under a tremendous fire, they attained a position which\r\nenabled them to assault and carry the formidable work by the bayonet.\r\nBut the convent still held out. Twenty minutes after the _tête de\r\npont_ had been taken, and after a desperate battle of two hours and a\r\nhalf, that stronghold threw out the white flag. Yet it is probable\r\nthat even then the conflict would not have ended, had not the 3d\r\ninfantry under Captains Alexander, J. M. Smith, and Lieutenant O. L.\r\nShepherd, cleared the way by fire and the bayonet to enter the work.\r\n\r\nWhilst this gallant task was being performed in front of the Mexican\r\ndefences, Generals Pierce and Shields had been engaged on our left, in\r\nturning the enemy's works so as to prevent the escape of the\r\ngarrisons, and to oppose the extension of numerous corps from the\r\nrear, upon and around our left. By a winding march of a mile around to\r\nthe right, this division under the command of Shields, found itself on\r\nthe edge of an open, wet meadow, near the main road to the capital, in\r\nthe presence of nearly four thousand of the enemy's infantry, a little\r\nin the rear of Churubusco. Shields posted his right at a strong\r\nedifice, and extended his left wing parallel to the road, to outflank\r\nthe enemy towards the capital. But the Mexicans extended their right\r\nmore rapidly, and were supported by several regiments of cavalry, on\r\nbetter ground. Shields, accordingly, concentrated his division about a\r\nhamlet, and attacked in front. The battle was long and bravely\r\nsustained with varied success, but finally resulted in crowning with\r\nvictory the zeal and courage of the American commander and his gallant\r\ntroops. Shields took 380 prisoners, including officers; while at\r\nChurubusco seven field pieces, some ammunition, one standard, three\r\nGenerals, and 1261 prisoners, including other officers, were the\r\nfruits of the sharply contested victory.\r\n\r\nThis was the last conquest on that day of conquests. As soon as the\r\n_tête de pont_ fell, Worth's and Pillow's divisions rushed onward by\r\nthe highway towards the city, which now rose in full sight before\r\nthem, at the distance of four miles. Bounding onward, flushed and\r\nexultant, they encountered Shields' division, now also victorious, and\r\nall combined in the headlong pursuit of the flying foe. At length the\r\ncolumns parted, and a small part of Harney's cavalry, led by Captain\r\nKearney of the 1st dragoons, dashed to the front and charged the\r\nretreating Mexicans up to the very gates of the city.\r\n\r\nThus terminated the first series of American victories in the valley\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--It is ungracious to criticize unfavorably the conduct of a\r\n    conquered foe, but there are some things in Santa Anna's behavior\r\n    at Contreras and Churubusco, which must not be passed silently. At\r\n    Contreras, he came with aid, by a short and fine highway, to the\r\n    field at a late period, when the Americans, moving slowly over an\r\n    unknown and broken country, had already outflanked with a strong\r\n    force, Valencia's left, and he then made no effort whatever, with\r\n    his _large support_, to relieve the beleagured general. If he did\r\n    not design doing any thing, why did he come at all; and, if as he\r\n    says, he believed Valencia could, during the night, withdraw all\r\n    his forces, after spiking his guns, by a secret path of which he\r\n    apprised him, why did he not take the same path to aid him? Did he\r\n    believe that it was best to lose Valencia and his division only,\r\n    without risking the loss of the large support under his own\r\n    command? In the _morning_ of the 20th it was certainly too late\r\n    for action, but Santa Anna must have been convinced, when he\r\n    _ordered the retreat_ from the Hacienda of San Antonio, and thus\r\n    voluntarily opened a gate for Worth's advance, that now, if ever,\r\n    had arrived the moment for a general action in front of the city,\r\n    the key of which, on the main road, was the convent of Churubusco\r\n    and the adjacent works. The loss of Valencia's army and _materiel_\r\n    was undoubtedly disheartening, but, according to his own account,\r\n    Santa Anna had been prepared for an event which he _foresaw_. This\r\n    should not have destroyed his self-possession if he sincerely\r\n    desired victory. When Contreras fell, he had, in reality, only\r\n    lost a division consisting of five or six thousand men. The whole\r\n    centre and left wing of his army were untouched, and these must\r\n    have numbered at least 20,000. Yet, if we admit the brave\r\n    resistance of the garrison, only hastily thrown into the convent\r\n    and works at Churubusco, it may then be asked what masterly effort\r\n    Santa Anna made (at the moment when he had actually drawn the\r\n    American army into the valley) to bring on a _general action_ with\r\n    all the fresh troops either under his own command or under that of\r\n    obedient, brave, skilful, and patriotic officers? The Mexican\r\n    accounts of these actions, and in fact, his own despatch from\r\n    Tehuacan, dated 19th Nov. 1847, exhibit no able man[oe]uvres on\r\n    the last field with which he was perfectly and personally\r\n    familiar. The Americans stormed a single point,--and the battle\r\n    was over, though bravely fought by those who were under cover and\r\n    by the traitor battalion of San Patricio, formed of renegades from\r\n    our army. The despatches of Santa Anna, like most of the Mexican\r\n    despatches after military or political disaster, seem rather\r\n    designed to criminate others, and to throw the whole blame of\r\n    _ultimate_ complete defeat on Valencia, than to point out the\r\n    causes of conquest in spite of able generalship _after the fall of\r\n    Contreras_. See Santa Anna's despatches, Mexico 23 Aug. 1847; and\r\n    Tehuacan, 19 Nov. 1847, in Pillow's Court Martial, pp. 532 and\r\n    540. See also _Apuntes para la historia de la guerra_, &c., &c.,\r\n    chapters XVII-XVIII-XIX, and Ripley's History of the War, vol. 2,\r\n    p. 256; \"_No part of the Mexican force was ready for battle_,\r\n    except Rincon's command,\" says this writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n    WHY THE CITY WAS NOT ENTERED ON THE 20TH--CONDITION OF THE\r\n    CITY--DELIBERATION OF THE MEXICAN CABINET AND PROPOSALS--REASONS\r\n    WHY GENERAL SCOTT PROPOSED AND GRANTED THE ARMISTICE--DELIBERATIONS\r\n    OF COMMISSIONERS--PARTIES AGAINST SANTA ANNA--FAILURE OF THE\r\n    NEGOTIATION--MEXICAN DESIRE TO DESTROY SANTA ANNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day when the battles ended. One army was wearied\r\nwith fighting and victory; the other equally oppressed by labor and\r\ndefeat. The conquered Mexicans fled to their eastern defences or took\r\nrefuge within the gates of their city. There was, for the moment,\r\nutter disorganization among the discomfited, while the jaded band of a\r\nfew thousand invaders had to be rallied and reformed in their ranks\r\nand regiments after the desperate conflicts of the day over so wide a\r\nfield. It surely was not a proper moment for an unconcentrated army,\r\nalmost cut off from support, three hundred miles in the interior of an\r\nenemy's country, and altogether ignorant of the localities of a great\r\ncapital containing nearly two hundred thousand inhabitants, to rush\r\nmadly, at night fall, into the midst of that city. Mexico, too, was\r\nnot an ordinary town with wide thoroughfares and houses like those in\r\nwhich the invaders had been accustomed to dwell. Spanish houses are\r\nalmost castles in architectural strength and plan, while from their\r\nlevel and embattled roofs, a mob, when aroused by the spirit of\r\nrevenge or despair, may do the service of a disciplined army. Nor was\r\nit known whether the metropolis had been defended by works along its\r\nstreets,--by barricades, impediments and batteries,--among which the\r\nentangled assailants might be butchered with impunity in the narrow\r\npassages during the darkness and before they could concentrate upon\r\nany central or commanding spot. Repose and daylight were required\r\nbefore a prudent General would venture to risk the lives of his men\r\nand the success of his whole mission upon such a die.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the army was halted; the dispersed recalled, the wounded\r\nsuccored, the dead prepared for burial, and the tired troops ordered\r\nto bivouack on the ground they had wrested from the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE VOLCANOES FROM TACUBAYA.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the greatest consternation prevailed within the city. When\r\nSanta Anna reached the Palace, he hastily assembled the Ministers of\r\nState and other eminent citizens, and, after reviewing the disasters\r\nof the day and their causes, he proclaimed the indispensable necessity\r\nof recurring to a truce in order to take a long respite. There was a\r\ndifference of opinion upon this subject; but it was finally agreed\r\nthat a suspension of arms should be negotiated through the Spanish\r\nMinister and the British Consul General. Señor Pacheco, the Minister\r\nof Foreign Relations, accordingly addressed Messrs. Mackintosh and\r\nBermudez de Castro, entreating them to effect this desired result.\r\nDuring the night the British Consul General visited the American camp,\r\nand was naturally anxious to spare the effusion of blood and the\r\nassault by an army on a city in which his country had so deep an\r\ninterest. On the morning of the 21st, when General Scott was about to\r\ntake up battering or assaulting positions, to authorize him to summon\r\nthe capital to surrender or to sign an armistice with a pledge to\r\nenter at once into negotiations for peace, he was met by General Mora\r\ny Villamil and Señor Arrangoiz, with proposals for an armistice in\r\norder to bury the dead, but without reference to a treaty. Scott had\r\nalready determined to offer the alternative of assault or armistice\r\nand treaty to the Mexican government, and this resolution had been\r\nlong cherished by him. Accordingly he at once rejected the Mexican\r\nproposal, and, without summoning the city to surrender, despatched a\r\nnote to Santa Anna, expressing his willingness to sign, on reasonable\r\nterms, a short armistice, in order that the American Commissioner and\r\nthe Mexican Government, might amicably and honorably settle the\r\ninternational differences, and thus close an unnatural war in which\r\ntoo much blood had already been shed. This frank proposal, coming\r\ngenerously from the victorious chief, was promptly accepted.\r\nCommissioners were appointed by the commanders of the two armies on\r\nthe 22d; the armistice was signed on the 23d, and ratifications\r\nexchanged on the 24th; and thus, the dispute was for a while\r\ntransferred once more from the camp to the council chamber. On the\r\nmorning of the 21st, the American army was posted in the different\r\nvillages in the vicinity. Worth's division occupied Tacubaya. Pillow's\r\nMixcoac, Twiggs's San Angel, while Quitman's remained still at San\r\nAgustin, where it had served during the battles of the 19th and 20th\r\nin protecting the rear and the trains of the army. Tacubaya became the\r\nresidence of General Scott, and the headquarters of the\r\ncommander-in-chief were established in the Bishop's Palace.\r\n\r\nThere are critics and politicians who are never satisfied with\r\nresults, and, whilst their prophecies are usually dated after the\r\nevents which they claim to have foreseen, they unfortunately find too\r\nmuch favor with the mass of readers who are not in the habit of\r\nascertaining precisely what was known and what was not known at the\r\nperiod of the occurrences which they seek to condemn. General Scott\r\nhas fallen under the heavy censure of these writers for offering the\r\narmistice and avoiding the immediate capture of the capital, the\r\npracticability of which they _now_ consider as demonstrated. We\r\npropose to examine this question, but we believe that the\r\npracticability or impracticability of that event does not become one\r\nof the primary or even early elements of the discussion.\r\n\r\nIf we understand the spirit of this age correctly, we must believe\r\nthat mankind, purified by the progressive blessings of Christianity\r\nand modern civilization, desires the mitigation rather than the\r\nincrease of the evils of war. It does not seek merely to avert danger\r\nor disaster from the forces of one party in the strife, but strives to\r\nproduce _peace_ with as little harm as possible to all who are engaged\r\nin warfare. It is not the mission of a soldier to kill, because his\r\nprofession is that of arms. It is ever the imperative duty of a\r\ncommander to stop the flow of human blood as soon as he perceives the\r\nslightest chance of peace; and if his honorable efforts fail entirely,\r\nthrough the folly or obstinacy of the foe, he will be more fully\r\njustified in the subsequent and stringent measures of coercion.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican masses, mistaking vanity for true national pride, had\r\nhitherto persevered in resisting every effort to settle the\r\ninternational difficulties. Diplomacy, with such a nation, is\r\nextremely delicate. If we exhibited symptoms of leniency, she became\r\npresumptuous;--if we pushed hostilities to the extreme, she grew\r\ndoggedly obstinate. On the 21st of August her capital was in Scott's\r\npower. His victorious army was at her gates. Two terrible battles had\r\nbeen fought, and the combatants on both sides had shown courage, skill\r\nand endurance. The Mexican army was routed, but not entirely dispersed\r\nor destroyed. At this moment it doubtless occurred to General Scott,\r\nand to all who were calm spectators of the scene, that before the last\r\nand fatal move was made, it was his duty to allow Mexico to save her\r\npoint of honor by negotiating, ere the city was entered, and while she\r\ncould yet proclaim to her citizens and the world, that her capital had\r\nnever been seized by the enemy. This assuaged national vanity, and\r\npreserved the last vantage ground upon which the nation might stand\r\nwith pride if not with perfect confidence. It still left something to\r\nthe conquered people which was not necessary or valuable to us.\r\n\r\nThere are other matters, unquestionably, that weighed much in the very\r\nresponsible deliberations of General Scott. If our army entered the\r\ncity triumphantly, or took it by assault, the frail elements of\r\ngovernment still lingering at that period of disorganization, would\r\neither fly or be utterly destroyed. All who were in power, in that\r\nnation of jealous politicians and wily intriguers would be eager to\r\nshun the last responsibility. If Santa Anna should be utterly beaten,\r\nthe disgrace would blot out the last traces of his remaining prestige.\r\nIf so fatal a disaster occurred, as subsequent events proved, the\r\nAmericans would be most unfortunately situated in relation to peace,\r\nfor there would be no government to negotiate with! Santa Anna's\r\ngovernment was the only _constitutional_ one that had existed in\r\nMexico for a long period, and with such a legalized national authority\r\npeace must be concluded. It was not our duty to destroy a government\r\nand then gather the fragments to reconstruct another with which we\r\nmight treat. If a revolutionary, or _provisional_ authority existed,\r\nwhat prospect had we of enduring pacification? What guaranty did we\r\nhold in a treaty celebrated with a military despot, a temporary chief,\r\nor a sudden usurper, that such a treaty could be maintained before the\r\nnation? What constitutional or legal right would an American general\r\nor commissioner have, to enter into such a compact? Was it not,\r\ntherefore, Scott's duty to act with such tender caution as not to\r\nendanger the fate of the only man who might still keep himself at the\r\nhead of his rallied people?\r\n\r\nBesides these political considerations, there are others, of a\r\nmilitary character, that will commend themselves to the prudent and\r\nthe just. The unacclimated American army had marched from Puebla to\r\nthe valley of Mexico during the rainy season, in a tropical zone, when\r\nthe earth is saturated with water, and no one travels who can avoid\r\nexposure. Our men were forced to undergo the hardships of such a\r\ncampaign, to make roads, to travel over broken ground, to wade\r\nmarshes, to bivouack on the damp soil with scarce a shelter from the\r\nstorm, to march day and night, and finally, without an interval of\r\nrepose, to fight two of the sharpest actions of the war. The seven or\r\neight thousand survivors of these actions,--many of whom were new\r\nlevies--demanded care and zealous husbanding for future events. They\r\nwere distant from the coast and cut off from support or immediate\r\nsuccor. The enemy's present or prospective weakness was not to be\r\nrelied on. Wisdom required that what was in the rear should be thought\r\nof as well as what was in advance.\r\n\r\nMay it not then be justly said that it was a proper moment for a heroic\r\ngeneral to pause in front of a national capital containing two hundred\r\nthousand people, and to allow the civil arm to assume, for a moment of\r\ntrial, the place of the military? Like a truly brave man, he despised\r\nthe eclat of entering the capital as Cortéz had done on nearly the same\r\nday of the same month, three hundred and twenty-six years before. Like a\r\nwise man, he considered the history and condition of the enemy, instead\r\nof his personal glory, and laid aside the false ambition of a soldier,\r\nto exhibit the forbearance of a christian statesman.[73]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe American Commissioner unquestionably entered upon the negotiations\r\nin good faith, and it is probable that Santa Anna was personally quite\r\nas well disposed for peace. He, however, had a delicate game to play\r\nwith the politicians of his own country, and was obliged to study\r\ncarefully the posture of parties as well as the momentary strength of\r\nhis friends and enemies. Well acquainted as he was with the value of\r\nmen and the intrigues of the time, he would have been mad not to guard\r\nagainst the risk of ruin, and, accordingly, his first efforts were\r\ndirected rather towards obtaining the _ultimatum_ of the United\r\nStates, than to pledging his own government in any project which might\r\nprove either presently unpopular or destroy his future influence. The\r\ninstructions, therefore, that were given to General José J. de\r\nHerrera, Bernardo Couto, Ignacio Mora y Villamil and Miguel Atristain,\r\nthe Mexican commissioners, were couched in such extreme terms, that\r\nmuch could be yielded before there was a likelihood of approaching the\r\nAmerican demands. In the meanwhile, as negotiations progressed, Mexico\r\nobtained time to rally her soldiers, to appease those who were\r\ndiscontented with the proposed peace, and to abjure the project if it\r\nshould be found either inadmissible or impossible of accomplishment\r\nwithout loss of popularity.\r\n\r\nFor several days consultations took place between Mr. Trist and the\r\ncommissioners, but it was soon found that the American pretensions in\r\nregard to the position of Texas, the boundary of the Rio Grande and\r\nthe cession of New Mexico and Upper California, were of such a\r\ncharacter that the Mexicans would not yield to them at the present\r\nmoment. The popular feeling, stimulated by the rivals of Santa Anna,\r\nhis enemies, and the demagogues, was entirely opposed to the surrender\r\nof territory. Sensible as the President was, that the true national\r\ninterests demanded instantaneous peace, he was dissuaded by his\r\nconfidential advisers from presenting a counter projét, which would\r\nhave resulted in a treaty. Congress, moreover, had virtually dissolved\r\nby the precipitate departure of most of its members after the battles\r\nof the 20th.\r\n\r\nAll the party leaders labored diligently at this crisis, but none of\r\nthem with cordiality for Santa Anna, in whose negotiations of a\r\nsuccessful peace with the United States, they either foresaw or feared\r\nthe permanent consolidation of his power. The _puros_, or democrats,\r\nstill clung to their admiration of the constitution of our Union; to\r\ntheir opposition to the standing army; to their desire for modifying\r\nthe power and position of the church and its ministers, and to their\r\nunited hostility against the President. They were loud in their\r\nexhortations to continue the war, while Olaguibel, one of their ablest\r\nmen and most devoted lovers of American institutions, issued a strong\r\nmanifesto against the projected treaty. This was the party which, it\r\nis asserted, in fact desired the prolongation of the war until the\r\ndestroyed nationality of Mexico took refuge from domestic intrigues,\r\nmisgovernment and anarchy, in annexation to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _monarquistas_, who still adhered to the church and the army,\r\nproclaimed their belief in the total failure of the republican system.\r\nRevolutions and incessant turmoils, according to their opinions, could\r\nonly be suppressed by the strong arm of power, and in their ranks had\r\nagain appeared General Mariano Paredes y Arrellaga, who, returning\r\nfrom exile, landed in disguise at Vera Cruz, and passing secretly\r\nthrough the American lines, proceeded to Mexico to continue his\r\nmachinations against Santa Anna, whom he cordially hated.\r\n\r\nThe _moderados_ formed a middle party equally opposed to the ultraisms\r\nof monarchy and democracy. They counted among their number, many of\r\nthe purest and wisest men in the republic, and although they were not\r\nas inimical to the United States as the _monarquistas_, or as many of\r\nthe _puros_ pretended to be, yet they cordially desired or hoped to\r\npreserve the nationality and progressive republicanism of Mexico. In\r\nthis junto Santa Anna found a few partizans who adhered to him more\r\nfrom policy than principle, for all classes had learned to distrust a\r\nperson who played so many parts in the national drama of intrigue,\r\nwar, and government. As a party, they were doubtless unwilling to risk\r\ntheir strength and prospects upon a peace which might be made under\r\nhis auspices.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis the President had no elements of strength still firmly\r\nattached to him but the army, whose favor, amid all his reverses, he\r\ngenerally contrived to retain or to win. But that army was now much\r\ndisorganized, and the national finances were so low that he was\r\nscarcely able to maintain it from day to day. The mob, composed of the\r\nlower classes, and the beastly _leperos_, knowing nothing of the\r\nprinciples of the war, and heedless of its consequences,--plied\r\nmoreover by the demagogues of all the parties,--shouted loudly for its\r\ncontinuance, and thus the president was finally forced to yield to the\r\nexternal pressure, and to be governed by an impulse which he was\r\neither too timid or too weak to control.\r\n\r\nThe armistice provided that the Americans should receive supplies from\r\nthe city, and that no additional fortifications should be undertaken\r\nduring its continuance; nevertheless the American trains were assailed\r\nby the populace of the city, and, it is alleged, that Santa Anna\r\ndisregarded the provision forbidding fortifications. When it became\r\nevident to the American commissioner and General Scott, that the\r\nMexicans were merely trifling and temporizing,--that the prolongation\r\nof the armistice would be advantageous to the enemy, without affording\r\nany correspondent benefits to us,--and when their supplies had been\r\nincreased so as to afford ample support for the army during the\r\nanticipated attack on the city,--it was promptly resolved to renew the\r\nappeal to arms. Accordingly, on the 6th of September, General Scott\r\naddressed Santa Anna, calling his attention to the infractions of the\r\ncompact, and declaring that unless satisfaction was made for the\r\nbreaches of faith before noon of the following day, he would consider\r\nthe armistice terminated from that hour. Santa Anna returned an answer\r\nof false recriminations, and threw off the mask. He asserted his\r\nwillingness to rely on arms;--he issued a bombastic appeal to the\r\npeople, in which he announced that the demands of the Americans would\r\nhave converted the nation into a colony of our Union. He improved upon\r\nthe pretended patriotic zeal of all the parties--puros, moderados,\r\nmonarquistas and mob--who had proclaimed themselves in favor of the\r\nwar. Instead of opposing or arguing the question, he caught the war\r\nstrain of the hour, and sent it forth to the multitude in trumpet\r\ntones. He was determined not to be hedged or entrapped by those who\r\nintrigued to destroy him, and resolved that if he must fall, his\r\nopponents should share the political disaster. Nor was he alone in\r\nhis electioneering gasconade, for General Herrera--a man who had been\r\nnotoriously the advocate of peace, both before and since the\r\nrupture,--addressed the clergy and the people, craving their aid by\r\nprayer, money, fire and sword, to exterminate the invaders! All\r\nclasses were, thus, placed in a false and uncandid position.\r\n\r\nThis is a sad picture of political hypocrisy based upon the misnamed\r\npopular will of a country which had for twenty years been demoralized\r\nby the very chieftain who was about to reap the direful harvest he had\r\nsown in the hearts of his people. Every man, every party,\r\nacknowledged, privately, the impolicy of continued hostilities, yet\r\nall men and all parties were resolved that _Santa Anna_ should not\r\nmake the peace whilst an American army remained in the country to\r\nsustain it, or an American government dispensed millions to pay for\r\nthe ceded territory. Distrusting his honesty and patriotism, they\r\nbelieved that the money would only be squandered among his parasites,\r\nor used for the prolonged corruption and disorganization of their\r\ncountry. With gold and an army they believed him omnipotent; but,\r\nstripped of these elements of power in Mexico, the great magician\r\ndwindled into a haggard and harmless witch.\r\n\r\nCombinations arose readily and bravely against the man whose sway was\r\nirresistible _as long as he dealt with his countrymen alone_ or\r\npreserved a loyal army and dependant church, whose strength and wealth\r\nwere mutual supports. The sky was dark and lowering around him, and he\r\nmust have acknowledged secretly, that the political parties of his\r\ncountry, if not his countrymen universally, were more anxious to\r\ndestroy him than the Americans. The army of the invaders, they hoped,\r\nmight perform a task in this drama, which the Mexicans themselves\r\ncould not achieve; and there are multitudes who would have been glad\r\nto see its end become tragic by the death of one whom they feared in\r\nprosperity, and despised in adversity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: It will be remembered that even Cortéz had paused in the\r\nprecincts of the ancient capital of the Aztecs, in order to give them\r\na chance of escape before striking the fatal blow. See Prescott, vol.\r\n3, p. 199. It is a little remarkable also, that the dates of Scott's\r\nand Cortéz's victories coincide so closely. Cortéz's victory was on\r\nthe 13th of August, 1521, Scott's on the 20th of August, 1847. The\r\ndate of Cortéz's achievement is given according to the Old Style, but\r\nif we add ten days to bring it up to New Style, it will be corrected\r\nto the 23d of August!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n    MILITARY POSITION OF THE AMERICANS AT THE END OF THE\r\n    ARMISTICE--MEXICAN DEFENCES--PLAN OF ATTACK--RECONNOISSANCES OF\r\n    SCOTT AND MASON--IMPORTANCE OF MEXICAN POSITION AT MOLINO DEL\r\n    REY--SCOTT'S SCHEME OF CAPTURING THE CITY--BATTLE OF MOLINO DEL\r\n    REY--REFLECTIONS AND CRITICISM ON THIS BATTLE--PREPARATIONS TO\r\n    ATTACK CHAPULTEPEC--STORMING OF CHAPULTEPEC AND OF THE CITY GATES\r\n    OF SAN COSMÉ AND BELEN--RETREAT OF THE MEXICAN ARMY AND\r\n    GOVERNMENT--AMERICAN OCCUPATION OF THE CITY OF MEXICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the armistice the position of the American\r\nforces was greatly changed from what it had been on the morning of the\r\n20th of August. The occupation of San Agustin had been followed by\r\nthat of Contreras, San Angel, Coyoacan and Churubusco in the course of\r\nthat day, and on the next, Mixcoac and Tacubaya were taken possession\r\nof. Thus the whole southern and south-western portion of the valley,\r\nin front of Mexico, were now held by the Americans; and this\r\ndisposition of their forces, commanding most of the principal\r\napproaches to the capital, enabled them, for the first time to select\r\ntheir point of attack.\r\n\r\nIn reconnoitering the chief outworks of the Mexicans by which he was\r\nstill opposed, General Scott found that there were several of great\r\nimportance. Directly north of his headquarters at Tacubaya, and\r\ndistant about a mile, arose the lofty, isolated hill of Chapultepec,\r\nsurrounded by its massive edifice, half castle, half palace, crowned\r\nwith cannon. This point, it was known, had been strongly fortified to\r\nmaintain the road leading from Tacubaya to the _garita_ of San Cosmé\r\non the west of the city. Westwardly, beyond the hill of Chapultepec,\r\nwhose southern side and feet are surrounded by a dense grove of\r\ncypresses, and on a rising ground within the military works designed\r\nto strengthen the castle, was the Molino del Rey, or King's Mill,\r\nwhich was represented to be a cannon foundry to which large quantities\r\nof church bells had been sent to be cast into guns. Still further\r\nwest, but near the Molino or Mill, was the fortified Casa Mata,\r\ncontaining a large deposit of powder.\r\n\r\nThese,--together with the strong citadel, lying near the _garita_ of\r\nBelen in the south-western corner of the city,--were the principal\r\nexternal defences still remaining beyond the immediate limits of the\r\ncapital. The city itself stands on a slight swell between lake Tezcoco\r\nand the western edge of the valley, and, throughout its greater\r\nextent, is girdled by a ditch or navigable canal extremely difficult\r\nto bridge in the face of an enemy, which serves the Mexicans not only\r\nas a military defence but for drainage and protection of their\r\ncustoms. Each of the eight strong city gates were protected by works\r\nof various character and merit. Outside and within the cross fires of\r\nthese gates there were other obstacles scarcely less formidable\r\ntowards the _south_. The main approaches to the city across the flat\r\nlands of the basin are raised on causeways flanked by wide and deep\r\nditches designed for their protection and drainage. These causeways,\r\nas well as the minor cross roads which are similarly built, were cut\r\nin many places and had their bridges destroyed so as to impede the\r\nAmerican's advance and to form an entangling net work; while the\r\nadjacent meadows were in this rainy season either filled with water in\r\nmany places or liable to be immediately flooded by a tropical storm.\r\n\r\nWith these fields for his theatre of action, and these defences still\r\nin front of him, it was an important and responsible question, whether\r\nGeneral Scott should attack Mexico on the west or on the south.\r\n\r\nThere can be hardly a doubt that the capture of the hill and castle of\r\nChapultepec, before assaulting the city, was imperatively demanded by\r\ngood generalship. If the capital were taken _first_, the Mexicans\r\ninstead of retreating towards Guadalupe and the north, when we\r\nattacked and captured from the _south_, would of course retire to the\r\navoided stronghold of Chapultepec; and, if our slender forces were\r\nsubsequently obliged to leave the city in order to take the fortress,\r\nour sick, wounded and thinned regiments would be left to the mercy of\r\nthe mob and the _leperos_. Chapultepec would thus become the nucleus\r\nand garrison of the whole Mexican army, and we might be compelled to\r\nfight two battles at the same time,--one _in_ the city, and the other\r\nat the castle. But, by capturing the castle first, and seizing the\r\nroad northward beyond it, we possessed all the most important outworks\r\nin the lap of the valley, and cut off the retreat of the Mexicans from\r\nthe city either to the west, to the castle, or towards our rear in the\r\nvalley. We obtained, moreover, absolute command of two of the most\r\nimportant entrances to the capital, inasmuch as from the eastern foot\r\nof the hill of Chapultepec two causeways, and aqueducts raised on\r\nlofty arches, diverged northeastwardly and eastwardly towards the\r\ncity. The northernmost of these entered Mexico by the _garita_ of San\r\nCosmé, while the other reached it by that of Belen near the citadel.\r\n\r\nIn attacking Chapultepec, it was important to consider the value of\r\nthe Molino del Rey or King's Mill, and Casa Mata, both of which, as we\r\nnoticed, lie on rising ground within the works designed to protect\r\nChapultepec. Upon examination it will be found that the Molino del\r\nRey, or King's Mill, bears the relation of a very strong western\r\noutwork both to the castle of Chapultepec and its approaches by the\r\ninclined plain which serves to ascend its summit. As the Molino del\r\nRey is commanded and defended by the castle, so it reciprocally,\r\ncommands and defends the only good approach to the latter.[74] As long\r\nas the Molino was held by the Mexicans, it would of course, form an\r\nimportant stronghold easily reached from the city around the rear of\r\nChapultepec; so that if Scott attacked the castle and hill from the\r\nsouth, where the road that ascends it commenced, he would be in danger\r\nof an attack on his left flank from the Mexicans in the defences at\r\nMolino and Casa Mata.\r\n\r\nIf the King's Mill fell, the result to the enemy would be that, in\r\naddition to the loss of an important outwork and the consequent\r\nweakening of the main work, its occupants or defenders would be driven\r\nfrom a high position above the roads and fields into the low grounds\r\nat the base of Chapultepec, which were completely commanded from the\r\nMolino, and thus the Mexicans would be unable to prevent the American\r\nsiege pieces from taking up the most favorable position for battering\r\nthe castle. It was important, therefore, not only that the foundry\r\nshould be destroyed, but, in a stratagetic view, it was almost\r\nindispensable in relation to future operations that the position\r\nshould be taken. It is undeniable, as following events showed, that\r\nthe Mexicans regarded it as one of their formidable military points.\r\nThe capture of Chapultepec and the destruction of the post at Molino\r\ndel Rey were, accordingly, determined on as preliminary to the final\r\nassault upon the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as the armistice was terminated bold reconnoissances were made\r\nby our engineers in the direction of Chapultepec and the Molino or\r\nKing's Mill and Casa Mata. On the 7th of September Santa Anna's answer\r\nto Scott's despatch was received, and on the same day the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and General Worth examined the enemy's formidable\r\ndispositions near and around the castle-crowned hill. The Mexican\r\narray was found to consist of an extended line of cavalry and\r\ninfantry, sustained by a field battery of four guns, either occupying\r\ndirectly or supporting a system of defences collateral to the castle\r\nand summit; _but as the lines were skilfully masked a very inadequate\r\nidea of the extent of the forces was obtained_. Captain Mason's\r\nreconnoissance on the morning of the same day, represented the enemy's\r\nleft as resting on and occupying the group of strong stone buildings\r\nat the Molino adjacent to the grove at the foot of Chapultepec and\r\ndirectly under the castle's guns. The right of his line rested on the\r\nCasa Mata, at the foot of the ridge sloping gradually to the plain\r\nbelow from the heights above Tacubaya; while, midway between these\r\nbuildings, were the field battery and infantry forces disposed on\r\neither side to support it. This reconnoissance indicated that the\r\n_centre_ was the weak point of the position, and that its left flank\r\nwas the strongest. In the Mill or Molino, on the left, was the brigade\r\nof General Leon, reinforced by the brigade of General Rangel; in the\r\nCasa Mata, on the right, was the brigade of General Perez; and on the\r\nintermediate ground was the brigade of General Ramirez, with several\r\npieces of artillery. The Mexican reserve was composed of the 1st and\r\n3d light, stationed in the groves of Chapultepec, while the cavalry\r\nconsisting of 4,000 men, rested at the hacienda of Morales, not very\r\nfar from the field. Such was the arrangement of the Mexican forces\r\nmade by Santa Anna in person on the 7th of September, though it has\r\nbeen alleged by Mexican writers that it was somewhat changed during\r\nthe following night. The wily chief had not allowed the time to pass\r\nduring the negotiation between Trist and the Commissioners in\r\npolitical discussion alone. Regarding the failure of the treaty as\r\nmost probable, he had striven to strengthen once more the military arm\r\nof his nation, and the first result of this effort was demonstrated in\r\nhis disposition of troops at El Molino del Rey. The Americans' attack\r\nupon Chapultepec, as commanding the nearest and most important access\r\nto the city had been foreseen by him as soon as the armistice ended,\r\nand as a military man, he well knew that the isolated hill and castle\r\ncould not be protected by the defenders within its walls alone or by\r\ntroops stationed either immediately at its base or on the sloping road\r\nalong its sides.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott's plan of assault upon the city seems now to have been\r\nmatured, though it required several days for full development\r\naccording to the reconnoissances of his engineers. He designed to make\r\nthe main assault on the west and not on the south of the city.\r\nPossessing himself suddenly of the Molino del Rey and the adjacent\r\ngrounds he was to _retire_ after the capture _without carrying\r\nChapultepec_, the key of the roads to the western _garitas_ of San\r\nCosmé and Belen. The immediate capture of Chapultepec would have been\r\na signal to Santa Anna to throw his whole force into the western\r\ndefence of the city; but by retiring, after the fall of the Molino or\r\nKing's Mill, and by playing off skilfully on the south of the city in\r\nthe direction of the garita of San Antonio Abad, Scott would\r\neffectually divert the attention of the Mexicans to that quarter and\r\nthus induce them to weaken the western defences and strengthen the\r\nsouthern. At length, at the proper moment, by a rapid inversion of his\r\nforces from the south to the west, he intended to storm the\r\ncastle-crowned hill, and rush along the causeways to the capital\r\nbefore the enemy could recover his position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, an attack upon El Molino del Rey and La\r\nCasa Mata was the first great work to be accomplished, and as soon as\r\nSanta Anna's reply closing the armistice was received on the 7th the\r\nadvance towards that place was ordered for the following morning. This\r\nimportant work was entrusted to General Worth, whose division was\r\nreinforced by three squadrons of dragoons; one command of 270 mounted\r\nriflemen under Major Sumner; three field pieces under Captain Drum;\r\ntwo twenty-four pounders under Captain Huger, and Cadwallader's\r\nbrigade 784 strong. The reconnoissances had been completed; at three\r\no'clock in the morning of the 8th of September the several columns\r\nwere put in motion on as many different routes, and when the gray dawn\r\nenabled them to be seen they were as accurately posted as if in midday\r\nfor review. Colonel Duncan was charged with the general disposition of\r\nthe artillery, while the cavalry were under Major Sumner.\r\n\r\nAt the first glimmer of day Huger's powerful guns saluted the walls of\r\nEl Molino and continued to play in that quarter until this point of\r\nthe enemy's line became sensibly shaken. At that moment the assaulting\r\nparty, commanded by Wright of the 8th Infantry, dashed forward to\r\nassault the centre. Musketry and cannister were showered upon them by\r\nthe aroused enemy, but on they rushed, driving infantry and\r\nartillerists at the point of the bayonet, capturing the field pieces\r\nand trailing them on the flying foe, until the Mexicans perceiving\r\nthat they had been assailed by a mere handful of men suddenly rallied\r\nand reformed. In an instant the reassured and gallant foe opened upon\r\nthe Americans a terrific fire of musketry, striking down eleven out\r\nof the fourteen officers who composed the command, and, for the time,\r\nstaggering the staunch assailants. But this paralysis continued for an\r\ninstant only. A light battalion which had been held to cover Huger's\r\nbattery, commanded by Captain E. Kirby Smith, rushed forward to\r\nsupport, and executing its bloody task amid horrible carnage, finally\r\nsucceeded in carrying the line and occupying it with our troops. In\r\nthe meanwhile Garland's brigade, sustained by Drum's artillery\r\nassaulted the enemy's left near the Molino, and after an obstinate\r\ncontest drove him from his position under the protecting guns of\r\nChapultepec. Drum's section and Huger's battering guns advanced to the\r\nenemy's position, and his captured pieces were now opened on the\r\nretreating force. While these efforts were successfully making on the\r\nMexican centre and left, Duncan's battery blazed on the right, and\r\nColonel Mackintosh was ordered to assault that point. The advance of\r\nhis brigade soon brought it between the enemy and Duncan's guns, and\r\ntheir fire was of course discontinued. Onwards sternly and steadily\r\nmoved the troops towards the Casa Mata, which, as it was approached,\r\nproved to be a massive stone work surrounded with bastioned\r\nentrenchments and deep ditches, whence a deadly fire was delivered and\r\nkept up without intermission upon our advancing troops until they\r\nreached the very slope of the parapet surrounding the citadel. The\r\nhavoc was dreadful. A large proportion of the command was either\r\nkilled or wounded; but still the ceaseless fire from the Casa Mata\r\ncontinued its deadly work, until the maimed and broken band of gallant\r\nassailants was withdrawn to the left of Duncan's battery where its\r\nremnants rallied. Duncan and Sumner had meanwhile been hotly engaged\r\nin repelling a charge of Mexican cavalry on the left, and having just\r\ncompleted the work, the brave Colonel found his countrymen retired\r\nfrom before the Casa Mata and the field again open for his terrible\r\nweapons. Directing them at once upon the fatal fort he battered the\r\nMexicans from its walls, and as they fled from its protecting\r\nenclosure he continued to play upon the fugitives as relentlessly as\r\nthey had recently done upon Mackintosh and his doomed brigade.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans were now driven from the field at every point. La Casa\r\nMata was blown up by the conquerors. Captured ammunition and cannon\r\nmoulds in El Molino were destroyed. And the Americans, according to\r\nScott's order previous to the battle, returned to Tacubaya, with three\r\nof the enemy's guns, (a fourth being spiked and useless,) eight\r\nhundred prisoners including fifty-two commissioned officers, and a\r\nlarge quantity of small arms, with gun and musket ammunition. Three\r\nthousand two hundred and fifty-one Americans, had on this day, driven\r\nfour times their number from a selected field; but they had paid a\r\nlarge and noble tribute to death for the victory. Nine officers were\r\nincluded in the one hundred and sixteen of our killed, and forty-nine\r\nofficers in the six hundred and sixty-five of our wounded. The\r\nMexicans suffered greatly in wounded and slain, while the gallant\r\nGeneral Leon and Colonel Balderas fell fighting bravely on the field\r\nof battle.[75]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe battle was over by nine o'clock in the morning. The Americans,\r\nafter collecting their dead and wounded, retired from the bloody\r\nfield, but they were not allowed to mourn over their painful losses.\r\nThey had suffered severely, yet the battle had been most disastrous to\r\nthe Mexicans. The fine commands of Generals Perez and Leon and of\r\nColonel Balderas, were broken up; the position once destroyed, could\r\nnot serve for a second defence, and the _morale_ of the soldiers had\r\nsuffered. The Mexicans were beginning to believe that mere formidable\r\nmasses, if not directed by skilful chiefs, were, in truth, but\r\nharmless things, and not to be relied on very confidently for national\r\ndefence. The new levies, the old regular army, and the volunteers of\r\nthe city, had all been repeatedly beaten in the valley both before and\r\nsince the armistice. Nevertheless, Santa Anna, in spite of all these\r\ndefeats and disasters at the Molino and Casa Mata, caused the bells of\r\nthe city to be merrily rung for a victory, and sent forth\r\nproclamations by extraordinary couriers, in every direction,\r\nannouncing the triumph of Mexican valor and arms!\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 11th, Scott proceeded to carry out the remainder\r\nof his projected capture of the capital. His troops had been already\r\nfor some time hovering around the southern gates, and he now surveyed\r\nthem closely covered by General Pillow's division and Riley's brigade\r\nof Twigg's command, and then ordered Quitman from Coyoacan to join\r\nPillow by _daylight_, before the southern gates. _By night_ however,\r\nthe two Generals with their commands were to pass the two intervening\r\nmiles between their position and Tacubaya where they would unite with\r\nWorth's division, while General Twiggs was left, with Riley, Captain\r\nTaylor and Steptoe, in front of the gates to man[oe]uvre, threaten, or\r\nmake false attacks so as to occupy and deceive the enemy. General\r\nSmith's brigade was halted in supporting distance at San Angel, in the\r\nrear, till the morning of the 13th, so as to support our general depot\r\nat Mixcoac. This stratagem against the south was admirably executed\r\nthroughout the 12th and until the afternoon of the 13th, when it was\r\ntoo late for Santa Anna to recover from his delusion.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile preparations had been duly made for the operations on\r\nthe west by the capture of Chapultepec. Heavy batteries were\r\nestablished and the bombardment and cannonade under Captain Huger,\r\nwere commenced early on the morning of the 12th. Pillow and Quitman\r\nhad been in position, as ordered, since early on the night of the\r\n11th, and Worth was now commanded to hold his division in reserve near\r\nthe foundry to support Pillow, while Smith was summoned to sustain\r\nQuitman. Twiggs still continued to inform us with his guns that he\r\nheld the Mexicans on the defensive in that quarter and kept Santa Anna\r\nin constant anxiety. Scott's positions and strategy perfectly\r\ndisconcerted him. One moment on the south--the next at Tacubaya--then\r\nreconnoitering the south again--and, at last, concentrating his forces\r\nso that they might be easily moved northward to Chapultepec or\r\nsouthward to the gate of San Antonio Abad. These movements rendered\r\nhim constantly sensible of every hour's importance, yet he would not\r\nagree with the veteran Bravo who commanded Chapultepec and was\r\nconvinced that the hill and castle would be the points assailed.\r\nDuring the whole of the 12th the American pieces, strengthened by the\r\ncaptured guns, poured an incessant shower of shot into the fortress\r\nuntil nightfall, when the assailants slept upon their arms, to be in\r\nposition for an early renewal on the 13th.\r\n\r\nAt half-past five in the morning the American guns recommenced upon\r\nChapultepec; but still Santa Anna clung to the southern gates while\r\nScott was silently preparing for the final assault according to a\r\npreconcerted signal. About 8 o'clock, judging that the missiles had\r\ndone the work, the heavy batteries suddenly ceased firing, and\r\ninstantaneously Pillow's division rushed forward from the conquered\r\nMolino del Rey, and overbearing all obstacles, and rapidly clambering\r\nup the steep acclivities, raised their scaling ladders and poured over\r\nthe walls.[76]\r\n\r\nQuitman, supported by Generals Shields and Smith, was meanwhile\r\nadvancing rapidly towards the south-east of the works, over a causeway\r\nwith cuts and batteries defended by an army strongly posted outside\r\nthe works towards the east. But nothing could resist the impulse of\r\nthe storming division, though staunchly opposed and long held at bay,\r\nand whilst it rushed to complete the work, the New York, South\r\nCarolina, and Pennsylvania volunteers, under Shields, crossed the\r\nmeadows in front amid a heavy fire, and entered the outer enclosure of\r\nChapultepec in time to join the enterprise from the west. The castle\r\nwas now possessed at every point. The onslaught had been so rapid and\r\nresistless, that the Mexicans stood appalled as the human tide foamed\r\nand burst over their battlements. Men who had been stationed to fire\r\nthe mines either fled or were shot down. Officers fell at their posts,\r\nand the brave old Bravo, fighting to the last, was taken prisoner with\r\na thousand combatants.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna was at last undeceived. He detached at once the greater\r\nportion of his troops from near the garita of San Antonio Abad; but it\r\nwas too late;--the key to the roads of San Cosmé and Belen had fallen;\r\nthe advance works were weak, and the routed troops of Chapultepec fled\r\nrapidly along the causeways and over the meadows. Still as they\r\nretreated they fought courageously, and as our men approached the\r\nwalls, the fresh troops in the neighborhood poured their volleys from\r\nbehind parapets, windows and steeples. Nevertheless, Santa Anna dared\r\nnot withdraw all his forces in the presence of Twigg's threatening\r\ndivision on the south.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Worth had seized the causeway and aqueduct of San Cosmé,\r\nwhile Quitman advanced by the other towards the garita of Belen. The\r\ndouble roads on each side of these aqueducts which rested on open\r\narches spanning massive pillars, afforded fine points for attack and\r\ndefence. Both the American Generals were prompt in pursuing the\r\nretreating foe, while Scott, who had ascended the battlements of\r\nChapultepec and beheld the field spread out beneath him like a map,\r\nhastened onward all the stragglers and detachments to join the flushed\r\nvictors in the final assault.\r\n\r\nWorth speedily reached the street of San Cosmé and became engaged in\r\ndesperate conflict with the enemy from the houses and defences.\r\nOrdering forward Cadwallader's brigade with mountain howitzers,\r\npreceded by skirmishers and pioneers with pick-axes and crow bars to\r\nforce windows and doors and to burrow through the walls, he rapidly\r\nattained an equality of position with the enemy; and by 8 o'clock in\r\nthe evening, after carrying two batteries in this suburb, he planted a\r\nheavy mortar and piece of artillery from which he might throw shot and\r\nshells into the city during the night. Having posted guards and\r\nsentinels and sheltered his weary men, he at length found himself with\r\nno obstacle but the gate of San Cosmé between his gallant band and the\r\ngreat square of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit by Quitman on the road to the gate of Belen had been\r\nequally hot and successful. Scott originally designed that this\r\nGeneral should only man[oe]uvre and threaten the point so as to favor\r\nWorth's more dangerous enterprise by San Cosmé. But the brave and\r\nimpetuous Quitman, seconded by the eager spirits of his division,\r\nlonging for the distinction of which they had been hitherto deprived,\r\nheeded neither the external defences nor the more dangerous power of\r\nthe neighboring citadel. Onward he pressed his men under flank and\r\ndirect fires;--seized an intermediate battery of two guns;--carried\r\nthe gate of Belen,--and thus, before two o'clock, was the first to\r\nenter the city and maintain his position with a loss proportionate to\r\nthe steady firmness of his desperate assault. After nightfall, he\r\nadded several new defences to the point he had won so gloriously, and\r\nsheltering his men as well as he was able, awaited the return of\r\ndaylight under the guns of the formidable and unsubdued citadel.\r\n\r\nSo ended the battles of the 13th of September, 1847, and so, in fact,\r\nended the great contests of the war. Santa Anna had been again\r\n\"disconcerted\" in his plan of battle, by Scott, as he had previously\r\nbeen thwarted by Valencia's disobedience and wilfulness. Scott would\r\nnot attack the south of the city where he expected him, and\r\nconsequently the American chief conquered the point where he had not\r\nexpected him!\r\n\r\nWhen darkness fell upon the city a council of disheartened officers\r\nassembled in the Mexican citadel. After the customary crimination and\r\nrecrimination had been exhausted between Santa Anna and other\r\nofficers, it was acknowledged that the time had come to decide upon\r\nfuture movements. Beaten in every battle, they now saw one American\r\nGeneral already within the city gate, while another was preparing to\r\nenter on the following morning, and kept the city sleepless by the\r\nloud discharges of his heavy cannon or bursting bombs as they fell in\r\nthe centre of the capital. General Carrera believed the demoralization\r\nof his army complete. Lombardini, Alcorta and Perez coincided in his\r\nopinion, and Santa Anna at length closed the panic stricken council by\r\ndeclaring that Mexico must be evacuated during the night and by naming\r\nLombardini General-in-Chief, and General Perez second in command.\r\nBetween eight and nine o'clock Señor Trigueros called at the citadel\r\nwith his coach, and bore away the luckless military President to the\r\nsacred town of Guadalupe Hidalgo, three miles north of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the Mexican army began at midnight, and not long after,\r\na deputation from the Ayuntamiento, or City Council, waited upon\r\nGeneral Scott with the information that the federal government and\r\ntroops had fled from the capital. The haggard visitors demanded terms\r\nof capitulation in favor of the church, the citizens and the municipal\r\nauthorities. Scott refused the ill-timed request, and promising no\r\nterms that were not self imposed, sent word to Quitman and Worth to\r\nadvance as soon as possible on the following morning, and, guarding\r\ncarefully against treachery, to occupy the city's strongest and most\r\ncommanding points. Worth was halted at the Alameda, a few squares west\r\nof the Plaza, but Quitman was allowed the honor of advancing to the\r\ngreat square, and hoisting the American flag on the National Palace.\r\nAt 9 o'clock the Commander-in-Chief, attended by his brilliant staff,\r\nrode into the vast area in front of the venerable Cathedral and\r\nPalace, amid the shouts of the exulting army to whose triumphs his\r\nprudence and genius had so greatly contributed. It was a proud moment\r\nfor Scott, and he might well have flushed with excitement as he\r\nascended the Palace stairs and sat down in the saloon which had been\r\noccupied by so many Viceroys, Ministers, Presidents and Generals, to\r\nwrite the brief order announcing his occupation of the capital of\r\nMexico. Yet the elation was but momentary. The cares of conquest were\r\nnow exchanged for those of preservation. He was allowed no interval of\r\nrepose from anxiety. His last victories had entirely disorganized the\r\nRepublic. There was no longer a national government, a competent\r\nmunicipal authority, or even a police force which could be relied on\r\nto regulate the fallen city. Having accomplished the work of\r\ndestruction, the responsibility of reconstruction was now imposed upon\r\nhim; and first among his duties was the task of providing for the\r\nsafety and subordination of that slender band which had been so\r\nsuddenly forced into a vast and turbulent capital.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--We shall record as very interesting historical facts, the\r\n    numbers with which General Scott achieved his victories in the\r\n    valley.\r\n\r\nFORCES.\r\n\r\n  He left Puebla with                              10,738 rank and file.\r\n  At Contreras and Churubusco, there were           8,497 engaged.\r\n  At El Molino del Rey and La Casa Mata,            3,251    \"\r\n  On 12th and 13th September, at Chapultepec, &c.,  7,180    \"\r\n  Final attack on city, after deducting killed,   }\r\n     wounded, garrison of Mixcoac and Chapultepec,} 6,000\r\n\r\nLOSSES.\r\n\r\n  At Contreras and Churubusco,     137 killed.  877 wounded.  38 missing.\r\n  At El Molino, &c.,               116  \"       665   \"       18   \"\r\n  September 12th, 13th, and 14th,  130  \"       703   \"       29   \"\r\n                    Grand total of losses, 2,703.\r\n\r\n    \"On the other hand,\" says Scott in his despatch of 18th September,\r\n    1847, \"this small force has beaten on the same occasions, in view\r\n    of the capital, the whole Mexican army, composed, at the\r\n    beginning, of thirty odd thousand men, posted always in chosen\r\n    positions, behind entrenchments or more formidable defences of\r\n    nature and art;--killed or wounded of that number more than 7,000\r\n    officers and men,--taken 3,730 prisoners, one-seventh officers,\r\n    including 13 generals, of whom 3 had been Presidents of this\r\n    Republic;--captured more than 20 colors and standards, 75 pieces\r\n    of ordnance, besides 57 wall pieces, 20,000 small arms, and an\r\n    immense quantity of shot, shells and powder.\" See Ex.

The American\r\ninfantry relying chiefly on the bayonet and expecting to effect its\r\nobject by surprise and even at an earlier hour of the morning,\r\nadvanced with portions of the three thousand two hundred and fifty-one\r\nmen to attack at least eleven or twelve thousand Mexicans upon a field\r\nselected by themselves, protected by stone walls and ditches,\r\ncommanded by the fortress of Chapultepec and the ground swept by\r\nartillery, while four thousand cavalry threatened an overwhelming\r\ncharge! We have no criticism to make as to inequality of numbers, but\r\nalthough we believe that our officers did not anticipate so strong a\r\nresistance, we are satisfied that it would have been better to rely at\r\n_first_ upon the fatal work of mortars and _siege_ pieces, of which we\r\nhad abundance, and, _then_, to have permitted the bayonet to complete\r\nthe task the battering train had begun. If the difficulty of moving\r\nrapidly to the scene of action in the night, prevented a _night_\r\nattack and surprise, it would probably have been better to change the\r\nplan of battle even at a late hour. In the end, Duncan's great guns,\r\neffectually destroyed a post which had been the slaughter house of\r\nmany a noble American soldier. The Mexican cavalry behaved shamefully.\r\nIn Colonel Ramsey's notes on the translation of the Mexican _Apuntes\r\npara la historia de la Guerra_, &c., p. 347, he says: \"it is _now\r\nknown_ in Mexico that Santa Anna was in possession of General Scott's\r\norder to attack the Molino del Rey in a few hours after it was\r\nwritten, and during the whole of the 7th, troops were taking up their\r\npositions on that ground. It is believed further that Santa Anna knew\r\nthe precise force that was to attack. When, therefore, Scott supposed\r\nthat Worth would surprise the Mills and Casa Mata, he was met by what?\r\nShall the veil be raised a little further? There was a traitor among\r\nthe list of high ranking officers in the Mexican army, and for gold he\r\ntold the Mexican force. Scott had been betrayed by one not an\r\nAmerican, not an officer or soldier, but Santa Anna was betrayed by\r\none of his own officers and a Mexican. Santa Anna believed the\r\ninformation he received and acted on it. General Scott did _not_\r\nbelieve what he learned at night, and--the victory was won!\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The importance of the _previous_ capture of El Molino\r\ndel Rey was proved in this assault upon Chapultepec, for Pillow's\r\ndivision started from this very Mill, from within the enemy's work,\r\nand found itself on an equality with the foe up to the very moment of\r\nscaling the walls at the crest of the mount, whereas the other\r\nassaulting column under Quitman taking the only remaining road to the\r\ncastle, a causeway leading from Tacubaya, was successfully held at bay\r\nby the outworks defending this road at the base of the hill, until\r\nafter the castle was taken, and the opposing force was taken in rear\r\nby troops passing through and around Chapultepec. Had El Molino still\r\nbeen held by the Mexicans, the siege pieces would not have been\r\nallowed to play uninterruptedly, nor would the assaulting parties been\r\nable to take position or attack with impunity.

Smith's\r\nMemoir, ut antea p. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1847-1850.\r\n\r\n    ATTACK OF THE CITY MOB ON THE ARMY--QUITMAN GOVERNOR--PEÑA\r\n    PRESIDENT--CONGRESS ORDERED--SIEGE OF PUEBLA--LANE'S, LALLY'S AND\r\n    CHILDS'S VICTORIES--GUERRILLEROS BROKEN UP--MEXICAN\r\n    POLITICS--ANAYA PRESIDENT--PEACE NEGOTIATIONS--SCOTT'S\r\n    DECREE--PEÑA PRESIDENT--SANTA ANNA AND LANE--SANTA ANNA LEAVES\r\n    MEXICO FOR JAMAICA--TREATY ENTERED INTO--ITS CHARACTER--SANTA CRUZ\r\n    DE ROSALES--COURT OF INQUIRY--INTERNAL TROUBLES--AMBASSADORS AT\r\n    QUERÉTARO--TREATY RATIFIED--EVACUATION--REVOLUTIONARY\r\n    ATTEMPTS--CONDITION OF MEXICO SINCE THE WAR--CHARACTER OF SANTA\r\n    ANNA--NOTE ON THE MILITARY CRITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the divisions of the American army, after the enthusiastic\r\nexpression of their joy, begun to disperse from the great square of\r\nMexico in search of quarters, when the populace commenced firing upon\r\nthem from within the deep embrasures of the windows and from behind the\r\nparapet walls of the house tops. This dastardly assault by the mob of a\r\nsurrendered city lasted for two days, until it was terminated by the\r\nvigorous military measures of General Scott. Yet it is due to the\r\nMexicans to state that this horrible scheme of assassination was not\r\ncountenanced by the better classes, but that the base outbreak was\r\naltogether owing to the liberation of about two thousand convicts by the\r\nflying government on the previous night. These miscreants,--the scum and\r\noutcasts of Mexico--its common thieves, stabbers and notorious\r\nvagrants,--banded with nearly an equal number of the disorganized army,\r\nhad already thronged the Palace when Quitman arrived with his division,\r\nand it was only by the active exertion of Watson's marines, that the\r\nvagrant crowd was driven from the edifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT SQUARE OF MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Quitman was immediately appointed civil and military Governor\r\nof the conquered capital, and discharged his duties under the martial\r\nlaw proclaimed by Scott on the 17th September. The general order of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief breathes the loftiest spirit of self-respect,\r\nhonor and national consideration. He points out clearly the crimes\r\ncommonly incident to the occupation of subdued cities, and gives\r\nwarning of the severity with which their perpetrators will be\r\npunished. He protects the administration of justice among the Mexicans\r\nin the courts of the country. He places the city, its churches,\r\nworship, convents, monasteries, inhabitants and property, under the\r\nspecial safeguard of the faith and honor of the American army. And\r\nfinally, instead of demanding, according to the custom of many\r\ngenerals in the old world, a splendid ransom from the opulent city, he\r\nimposed upon it a trifling contribution of one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars,--twenty thousand of which he devoted to extra\r\ncomforts for the sick and wounded; ninety thousand to purchase\r\nblankets and shoes for gratuitous distribution among the common\r\nsoldiers, while but forty thousand were reserved for the military\r\nchest. This act of clemency and consideration is in beautiful contrast\r\nwith the last malignant spitefulness of the conquered army, whose\r\ncommander, unable to overthrow the invaders in fair combat, had\r\nreleased at midnight, the desperadoes from his prisons, with the hope\r\nthat assassination might do the work which military skill and\r\nhonorable valor had been unable to effect.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Santa Anna despatched a circular from the town of Guadalupe\r\nrecounting to the Governors of the different States the loss of the\r\ncapital, and, on the 16th, he issued a decree requiring Congress to\r\nassemble at Querétaro, which was designated as the future seat of\r\ngovernment. As president and politician, he at once saw that he could do\r\nnothing more without compromising himself still further. Resigning,\r\ntherefore, the executive chair in favor of his constitutional successor,\r\nSeñor Peña-y-Peña, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he despatched\r\nGeneral Herrera with four thousand troops to Querétaro, and departed to\r\nassail the Americans in Puebla. On the 18th he evacuated Guadalupe, and\r\ntook the road to the eastward, with two thousand cavalry commanded by\r\nGeneral Alvarez. He knew that the communication with our base of\r\noperations in that quarter was seriously interrupted if not entirely cut\r\noff; and he vainly hoped to recover his military prestige by some\r\nbrilliant feat of arms over detached or unequal squadrons.\r\n\r\nWhen Scott marched into the valley of Mexico, Puebla was left in\r\ncharge of Colonel Childs, with four hundred efficient men and nearly\r\neighteen hundred in his hospitals. The watchful commander and his\r\nsmall band preserved order until the false news of Mexican success at\r\nMolino del Rey was received. But, at that moment, the masses, joined\r\nby about three thousand troops under General Rea, a brave and\r\naccomplished Spaniard, rose upon, and besieged the slender garrison.\r\nOn the 22d, Santa Anna arrived, and increasing the assailants to\r\nnearly eight thousand, made the most vigorous efforts during the six\r\nfollowing days and nights to dislodge the Americans from the position\r\nthey had seized.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month, Brigadier General Lane left Vera Cruz\r\nwith a fresh command, and at Jalapa joined the forces of Major Lally,\r\nwho with nearly a thousand men and a large and valuable train, had\r\nfought his way thither against Jarauta and his guerrilleros at San\r\nJuan, Paso de Ovejas, Puente Nacional, Plan del Rio, Cerro-Gordo and\r\nLos Animas. As soon as the news of Puebla's danger reached these\r\ncommanders they marched to support the besieged band, while Santa Anna\r\nbelieving that Rea could either conquer or hold Childs in check until\r\nhis return, departed in quest of the advancing columns of Lane and\r\nLally, who were reported to have convoyed from the coast an immense\r\namount of treasure. The combined lust of glory and gold perhaps\r\nstimulated this last effort of the failing chief. Rea continued the\r\nsiege of Puebla bravely. Santa Anna, advancing eastward, and\r\napparently confident of success, established his headquarters at\r\nHuamantla; but whilst man[oe]uvering his troops to attack our\r\napproaching columns, Lane fell upon him suddenly on the 9th of\r\nOctober, and after a sharp action, remained victor on the field. On\r\nthe next day our eager general continued his march to Puebla, and\r\nentering it on the 13th of October, drove the Mexicans from all their\r\npositions and effectually relieved the pressed but pertinacious\r\ncommander of the beleagured Americans.\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of those who had been so long assailed to become\r\nassailants. Rea retired to Atlixco, about twenty-five miles from\r\nPuebla, but the inexorable Lane immediately followed in his steps, and\r\nreaching the retreat at sunset on the 19th, by a bright moonlight\r\ncannonaded the town from the overlooking heights. After an hour's\r\nincessant labor, Atlixco surrendered,--the enemy fled,--and thus was\r\ndestroyed a nest in which many a guerrillero party had been fitted out\r\nfor the annoyance or destruction of Americans.\r\n\r\nMexico possesses a wonderful facility in the creation of armies, or in\r\nthe aggregation of men under the name of soldiers. Wherever a standard\r\nis raised, it is quickly surrounded by the idlers, the thriftless, and\r\nthe improvident, who are willing, at least, to be supported if not\r\nmunificently recompensed for the task of bearing arms. At this period,\r\nand notwithstanding all the recent disgraceful and disheartening\r\ndefeats, a large corps had been already gathered in different parts of\r\nthe republic. The recruits were, however, divided into small,\r\nundisciplined, and consequently inefficient bodies. It is reported\r\nthat Lombardini and Reyes were in Querétaro with a thousand men; Santa\r\nAnna's command, now turned over to General Rincon by order of\r\nPresident Peña-y-Peña, consisted of four thousand; in Tobasco and\r\nChiapas there were two thousand; Urrea, Carrabajal and Canales\r\ncommanded two thousand; Filisola was at San Luis Potosi with three\r\nthousand; Peña y Barragan had two thousand at Toluca; one thousand\r\nwere in Oajaca, while nearly three thousand guerrilleros harassed the\r\nroad between Puebla and Vera Cruz and rendered it impassable after the\r\nvictories in the valley. The conflict was now almost given up to these\r\nmiscreants under Padre Jarauta and Zenobio, for, in the eastern\r\ndistricts, General Lane with his ardent partizans held Rincon,\r\nAlvarez, and Rea in complete check.\r\n\r\nThese guerrilla bands had inflicted such injury upon our people that\r\nit became necessary to destroy them at all hazards. This severe task\r\nwas accomplished by Colonel Hughes and Major John R. Kenly who\r\ncommanded at Jalapa, and by General Patterson, whose division of four\r\nthousand new levies was shortly to be reinforced by General Butler\r\nwith several thousand more. Patterson garrisoned the National Bridge\r\nin the midst of these bandit's haunts, and having executed, at Jalapa,\r\ntwo paroled Mexican officers captured in one of the marauding corps,\r\nand refused the surrender of Jarauta, he drove that recreant priest\r\nfrom the neighborhood into the valley of Mexico, in which Lane pursued\r\nand destroyed his reorganized band.\r\n\r\nWhilst these scattered military events were occurring, Peña-y-Peña, as\r\nPresident of the Republic, had endeavored, both at Toluca and at\r\nQuerétaro, to combine once more the elements of a congress and a\r\ngovernment. He summoned, moreover, the Governors of States to convene\r\nand consult upon the condition of affairs; he suspended Santa Anna;\r\nordered Paredes into nominal arrest at Tololopan; directed a court\r\nmartial upon Valencia for his conduct at Contreras; attempted to\r\nreform the army, and in all his acts seems to have been animated by a\r\nsincere spirit of national reorganization and peace. Nevertheless,\r\namong the deputies who were assembled, the same quarrels that\r\ndisgraced former sessions again arose between the Puros, the\r\nModerados, the Monarquistas, and Santannistas or friends of Santa\r\nAnna, who now formed themselves into a zealous party, notwithstanding\r\nthe disgraceful downfall of their leader. These contests were\r\ncontinued until early in November, when a quorum of the members\r\nreached Querétaro and elected Señor Anaya, the former President\r\nsubstitute, to serve until the month of January, to which period the\r\ncounting of votes for the Presidency had been postponed, as we have\r\nalready stated, by the intrigues of Santa Anna. Anaya's election was\r\na triumph of the Moderados.\r\n\r\nCongress broke up after a few day's session, having provided for the\r\nassemblage of a new one on the 1st of January, 1848; but,\r\nunfortunately most of the leaders did not depart from Querétaro which\r\nwas henceforth for many months converted into a political battle field\r\nfor the benefit or disgrace of the military partizans. The Puros, led\r\nby Gomez Farias, were joined by the disaffected officers of the army\r\nready for revolution, _pronunciamientos_, or any thing that might\r\nprolong the war with the same ultimate views that animated them during\r\nthe armistice in August. But Peña-y-Peña and Anaya were both firm,\r\ndiscreet and consistent in their resistance. The assembled Governors\r\nof States resolved to support the President, his opinions, and acts,\r\nwith their influence and means, while the mass of substantial citizens\r\nand men of property throughout the republic joined in an earnest\r\nexpression of anxiety for peace. Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, and\r\nJalisco, under the lead of Santannistas and Puros who mutually hated\r\neach other, alone continued hostile to a treaty.\r\n\r\nMr. Trist, soon after the capture of Mexico, had sounded Peña-y-Peña\r\nin relation to the renewal of negotiations; but it was not until the\r\nend of October that the prudent President thought himself justified in\r\nexpressing, through his minister, Don Luis de la Rosa, a simple but\r\nardent wish for the cessation of war. When Anaya assumed the\r\npresidency, a few days afterwards, Peña-y-Peña did not disdain to\r\nenter his cabinet as minister, and, on the 22d of November, offered to\r\nour envoy the appointment of commissioners. But in the meanwhile our\r\ngovernment at home believing that the continuance of Mr. Trist in\r\nMexico was useless, and probably discontented with his conduct, had\r\nrecalled him from the theatre of action. The American commissioner\r\nhastened, therefore, to decline the negotiation and apprised the\r\nMexicans of his position. But, mature reflection upon the political\r\nstate of Mexico, as well as upon the real desires of his government\r\nand people, induced Mr. Trist to change his views, and accordingly he\r\nnotified the Mexican cabinet that, in spite of his recall, he would\r\nassume the responsibility of a final effort to close the war. Good\r\njudgment at the moment, and subsequent events, fully justified our\r\nenvoy's diplomatic resolve. Commissioners were at once appointed to\r\nmeet him, and negotiations were speedily commenced in a spirit of\r\nsincerity and peace. General Scott, nevertheless, though equally\r\nanxious to terminate the conflict, did not for a moment intermit his\r\nmilitary vigilance. The capital, and the captured towns were still as\r\nstrictly governed; the growing army was organized for future\r\noperations, and a general order was issued demanding a large\r\ncontribution from each of the states for the support of our army. This\r\nmilitary decree, moreover, reformed and essentially changed the\r\nduties, taxation, collection and assaying of the nation; it indicated\r\nthe intention of our government to spread its troops all over the\r\nland; and while it reasserted the supremacy of law, and the purity of\r\nits administration, it announced instant death, by sentence of a\r\ndrum-head court-martial, to all who engaged in irregular war. This\r\ndecree satisfied reflecting Mexicans, who noticed the steady\r\nearnestness and increase of our army, that their nationality was\r\nseriously endangered, and greatly aided, as doubtless it was designed\r\nto do, in stimulating the action of the cabinet and commissioners.\r\n\r\nThus closed the eventful year of 1847. On the 1st of January, 1848,\r\nonly thirty deputies of the new congress appeared in their places; and\r\non the 8th,--the day for the decision of the presidency,--as there was\r\nstill no quorum in attendance, and Anaya's term had expired, he\r\npromptly resigned his power to his minister of foreign affairs,\r\nPeña-y-Peña, who reassumed the executive chair, as he formerly had\r\ndone, by virtue of his constitutional right as chief justice. Anaya at\r\nonce came into his cabinet as minister of war, while De la Rosa took\r\nthe port-folio of foreign relations. All these persons were still\r\nsincere coadjutors in the work of peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe destiny of Santa Anna was drawing to a close. Huamantla had been\r\nperhaps his last battle field in Mexico. About the middle of January\r\nGeneral Lane received information of the lurking place of the\r\nchieftain, who now, with scarcely the shadow of his ancient power or\r\ninfluence, was concealed at Tehuacan in the neighborhood of Puebla.\r\nThe astute intriguer's admission into the Republic had once been\r\nconsidered a master stroke of American policy; but his death, capture,\r\nor expulsion, was now equally desired by those who had watched him\r\nmore closely and knew him better. Lane, accordingly, with a band of\r\nabout three hundred and fifty mounted men, undertook the delicate task\r\nof seizing Santa Anna and had he not received timely warning,\r\nnotwithstanding the secrecy of the American's movements, it is\r\nscarcely probable that he would have quitted his retreat alive. Among\r\nthe corps of partizan warriors who went in search of the fugitive\r\nthere were many Texans who still smarted under the memory of the\r\ndreary march from Santa Fé in 1841, the decimation at Mier, the\r\ncruelties of Goliad and the Alamo; and the imprisonments in Mexico,\r\nPuebla, or Peroté in 1842. But when Lane and his troopers reached\r\nTehuacan, the game had escaped, though his lair was still warm. All\r\nthe personal effects left behind in his rapid flight, were plundered,\r\nwith the exception of his wife's wardrobe, which, with a rough though\r\nchivalrous gallantry, was sent to the beautiful but ill matched lady.\r\nA picked military escort, personally attached and doubtless well paid,\r\nstill attended him. But, beyond this, he had no military command, and\r\nas a soldier and politician, his power in Mexico had departed.\r\n\r\nHaving sought by public letters to throw, as usual, the disgrace of his\r\ndefeats at Belen and Chapultepec, upon General Terres and the\r\nrevolutionary hero Bravo, he aroused the united hatred of these men and\r\nthe disgust of their numerous friends. Public opinion openly condemned\r\nhim every where. After Lane's assault he took refuge in Oajaca; but the\r\npeople of that region were equally inimical and significantly desired\r\nhis departure. Thus, broken in fame and character, deprived of a party,\r\npersonal influence, patronage, and present use of his wealth, the foiled\r\nWarrior-President stood for a moment at bay. But his resolution was soon\r\ntaken. From Cascatlan he wrote to the minister of war on the 1st of\r\nFebruary, demanding passports, and at the same time he intimated to the\r\nAmerican Commander-in-chief his willingness to leave an ungrateful\r\nRepublic and to \"seek an asylum on a foreign soil where he might pass\r\nhis last days in that tranquillity which he could never find in the land\r\nof his birth.\" The desired passports were granted. He was assured that\r\nneither Mexicans nor Americans would molest his departure; and, moving\r\nleisurely towards the eastern coast with his family, he was met near his\r\nHacienda of Encero by a select guard, detailed by Colonel Hughes and\r\nMajor Kenly, and, escorted with his long train of troopers, domestics,\r\ntreasure and luggage to La Antigua, where he embarked on the 5th of\r\nApril, 1848, on board a Spanish brig bound to Jamaica. One year and\r\neight months before, returning from exile, he had landed from the\r\nsteamer Arab in the same neighborhood, to regenerate his country![77]\r\n\r\nBut before his departure probably forever from Mexico, Santa Anna had\r\nbeen doomed to see the peace concluded. The complete failure of the\r\nMexicans in all their battles, notwithstanding the courage with which\r\nthey individually fought at Churubusco, Chapultepec, and Molino del\r\nRey, impressed the nation deeply with the conviction of its inability\r\nto cope in arms with the United States. The discomfiture of Paredes,\r\nthe want of pecuniary resources, the disorganization of the country,\r\nthe growing strength of the Americans who were pouring into the\r\ncapital under Patterson, Butler and Marshall, and the utter failure of\r\nthe arch-intriguer,--all contributed to strengthen the arm of the\r\nexecutive and to authorize both the negotiation of a treaty and the\r\narrangement of an armistice until the two governments should ratify\r\nthe terms of peace. Mr. Nicholas P. Trist, Don Luis G. Cuevas, Don\r\nBernardo Couto, and Don Miguel Atristain, signed the treaty, thus\r\nconsummated, on the 2d of February, 1848, at the town of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo. Its chief terms were 1st, the re-establishment of peace; 2d,\r\nthe boundary which confirmed the southern line of Texas and gave us\r\nNew Mexico and Upper California; 3d, the payment of fifteen millions\r\nby the United States, in consideration of the extension of our\r\nboundaries; 4th, the payment by our government of all the claims of\r\nits citizens against the Mexican Republic to the extent of three and a\r\nquarter millions, so as to discharge Mexico forever from all\r\nresponsibility; 5th, a compact to restrain the incursions and\r\nmisconduct of the Indians on the northern frontier. The compact\r\ncontained in all, thirty-three articles and a secret article\r\nprolonging the period of ratification in Washington beyond the four\r\nmonths from its date as stipulated in the original instrument.\r\n\r\nThis important treaty, which, we believe, history will justly\r\ncharacterise as one of the most liberal ever assented to by the\r\nconquerors of so great a country, was despatched immediately by an\r\nintelligent courier to Washington; and, notwithstanding the irregularity\r\nof its negotiation after Mr. Trist's recall, was at once sent to the\r\nSenate by President Polk. In that illustrious body of statesmen it was\r\nfully debated, and after mature consideration, ratified, with but slight\r\nchange, on the 10th of March. Senator Sevier and Mr. Attorney General\r\nClifford, resigned their posts and were sent as Plenipotentiaries to\r\nMexico to secure its passage by the Mexican congress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the last action of the war was fought and won on the 16th of\r\nMarch, in ignorance of the armistice, by General Price at Santa Cruz\r\nde Rosales, near Chihuahua; and the diplomatic and military career of\r\ntwo of our most distinguished citizens was abruptly closed on the\r\ntheatre of their brilliant achievements. Scott, the victor of so many\r\nsplendid fields, was suspended from the command of the army he had led\r\nto glory, and General William O. Butler was ordered to replace him.\r\nHot dissensions had occurred between the Commander-in-chief, Worth,\r\nPillow, and other meritorious officers, and although our government\r\nmight well have avoided a scandalous rupture at such a moment in an\r\nenemy's capital, a Court of Inquiry was, nevertheless, convened to\r\ndiscuss the battles and the men who had achieved the victories! Nor\r\nwas Mr. Trist, the steadfast, persevering and successful friend of\r\npeace, spared when he had accomplished all that his government and\r\ncountrymen desired. Learned in the language of Spain; intimate with\r\nthe character of the people; familiar, by long residence, with their\r\ntastes, feelings and customs, he had been selected by our Secretary of\r\nState in consequence of his peculiar fitness for the mission and its\r\ndelicate diplomacy. Yet he was not allowed the honor of finishing his\r\nformal task at _Querétaro_ but was ordered home almost in disgrace.\r\nHistory, however, will render the justice that politicians and\r\ngovernments deny, and must honestly recognize the treaty which crowned\r\nand closed the war as emphatically the result of his skill and\r\nwatchfulness. The fate of the four most eminent men in this war\r\nillustrates a painful passage in the story of our country, for whilst\r\nFrémont, the pacificator of the west, was brought home a prisoner, and\r\nTaylor converted into a barrack master at Monterey,--Scott was almost\r\ntried for his victories in the presence of his conquered foes, and\r\nTrist disgraced for the treaty he had been sent to negotiate! But the\r\nprivate or public griefs of our commanders and diplomatists should\r\nproperly find no place in these brief historical sketches, nor must we\r\ndwell upon them, even in passing. The great victors and the able\r\nnegotiators are secure in the memory and gratitude of the future.\r\n\r\nWhile the court of inquiry pursued its investigations in the capital,\r\nand the United States Senate, at home, was engaged in ratifying the\r\ntreaty, President Peña-y-Peña and his cabinet still labored zealously\r\nto assemble a Congress at Querétaro. The Mexican President resolved,\r\nif necessary to obtain a quorum, to exclude New Mexico, California,\r\nand Yucatan from representation; the two first being in possession of\r\nthe United States and the latter in revolt. The disturbance in Yucatan\r\nwhich had been for some time fermenting, broke out fiercely in July,\r\n1847, and became, in fact, a long continued war of castes. The Indian\r\n_peones_ and _rancheros_, under their leaders Pat and Chi, carried\r\nfire and sword among the thinly scattered whites, until relief was\r\nafforded them by Commodore Perry, the Havanese, the English of Jamaica\r\nand some enlisted corps of American volunteers returning from the war.\r\nAbout Tuspan and Tampico on the east coast,--in the interior State of\r\nGuanajuato,--and on the northern frontiers of Sonora, Durango, and San\r\nLuis, the wild Indians, and the semi-civilized Indian laborers were\r\nrebellious and extremely annoying to the lonely settlers. There were\r\nsymptoms everywhere, not only of national disorganization, but almost\r\nof national dissolution. Yet, difficult as was the position of the\r\ngovernment, amid all these foreign and domestic dangers, every member\r\nstrove loyally to sustain the nation and its character until the\r\nreturn of the ratified treaty. Money was contributed freely by the\r\nfriends of peace, who sought a renewal of trade and desired to see the\r\nlabors of the mines and of agriculture again pursuing their wonted\r\nchannels. The clergy, too, who feared national ruin, annexation, or\r\ncomplete conquest, grudgingly bestowed a portion of their treasures;\r\nand thus the members of Congress were supplied with means to assemble\r\nat the seat of government.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th May, a brilliant _cortége_ of American cavalry was seen\r\nwinding along the hills towards Querétaro as the escort of the\r\nAmerican commissioners, who were welcomed to the seat of government by\r\nthe national authorities, and entertained sumptuously in an edifice\r\nset apart for their accommodation. The town was wild with rejoicing.\r\nThose who had been so recently regarded as bitter foes, were hailed\r\nwith all the ardor of ancient, and uninterrupted friendship. No one\r\nwould have imagined that war had ever been waged between the soldiers\r\nof the north and south who now shared the same barracks and pledged\r\neach other in their social cups. If the drama was prepared for the\r\noccasion by the government, it was certainly well played, and\r\nunquestionably diverted the minds of the turbulent and dangerous\r\nclasses of the capital at a moment when good feeling was most needed.\r\n\r\nCongress was in session when our commissioners arrived, and on the same\r\nday the Senate ratified the treaty, which, after a stormy debate, had\r\nbeen previously sanctioned by the Chamber of Deputies. On the 30th of\r\nMay the ratifications were finally exchanged, and the first instalment\r\nof indemnity being paid in the city of Mexico, our troops evacuated the\r\ncountry in the most orderly manner during the following summer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the Mexican Government, whose tenure of power\r\nwas so frail, almost trembled at the sudden withdrawal of our forces\r\nand the full restoration of a power for which, as patriots, they\r\nnaturally craved. The sudden relaxation of a firm and dreaded military\r\nauthority in the capital, amid all those classes of intriguing\r\npoliticians, soldiers, clergymen, and demagogues, who had so long\r\ndisturbed the nation's peace before Scott's capture of Mexico,\r\nnaturally alarmed the president and cabinet, who possessed no reliable\r\narmy to replace the departing Americans. But the three millions,\r\nreceived opportunely for indemnity, were no doubt judiciously used by\r\nthe authorities, while the men of property and opulent merchants\r\nleagued zealously with the municipal authorities to preserve order\r\nuntil national reorganization might begin. One of the first steps in\r\nthis scheme was the election by Congress of General Herrera,--a hero\r\nof revolutionary fame,--as Constitutional President, and of\r\nPeña-y-Peña as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. These and other\r\nconciliatory but firm acts gave peace at least for the moment to the\r\nheart of the nation; but beyond the capital all the bonds of the\r\nFederal Union were totally relaxed. Scarcely had the National\r\nGovernment been reinstalled in the city of Mexico, when General\r\nMariano Paredes y Arrillaga unfurled the standard of rebellion in\r\nGuanajuato, under the pretext of opposing the treaty. The\r\nadministration, possessing only the skeleton of an army, did not halt\r\nto consider the smallness of its resources, but promptly placed all\r\nits disposable men under the command of Anastasio Bustamante, who with\r\nMiñon, Cortazar, and Lombardini, not only put down the revolution of\r\nParedes, but, by their influence and admirable conduct imposed order\r\nand inspired renewed hopes for the future wherever they appeared. In\r\nthe same way the strong arm of power was honestly used to destroy\r\nfaction wherever it dared to lift its turbulent head,--and the\r\nNational Guard of the Federal District faithfully performed its duty\r\nin this patriotic task. Paredes disappeared after his fall in\r\nGuanajuato, and remained in concealment or obscurity until his death.\r\n\r\nVarious outbreaks occurred in Mazatlan, on the western coast; in the\r\nState of Tobasco; in Chiapas, and among the Indians of Puebla; in the\r\nHuasteca of the State of Mexico; and in the Sierra Gorda belonging to\r\nthe States of Querétaro, San Luis, and Guanajuato. These, like the\r\nrevolt in Yucatan, threatened a war of castes, but the energetic\r\ngovernment found means to subdue the rebels, and to reduce their\r\ndistricts to order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, for more than two years, has the government of President Herrera\r\nmaintained its respectability and authority in spite of a failing\r\ntreasury, political factionists, and domestic rebellion. The attempted\r\ntask of national reorganization has been honestly and firmly, if not\r\nsuccessfully carried out. The army, that canker of the nation, has\r\nbeen nearly destroyed, and its idle officers and men discharged to\r\nearn their living by honest labor. A great change has passed over\r\nMexico. Santa Anna lives abroad in almost compulsory exile. Canalizo\r\nand Paredes are dead. Bustamante, without political strength or party,\r\nretains a military command. The force in garrison does not amount to\r\nmore, probably, than five or six thousand. The prestige of the army\r\nwas blurred and blighted by the war. Nearly all the old political\r\nmanagers and intriguers are gradually passing from the stage, and,\r\nwith the new men coming upon it, to whom the war has taught terrible\r\nbut salutary lessons, we may hope that another era of civilization and\r\nprogress is about to dawn upon this great country. This hope is\r\nfounded on the establishment of order and official responsibility by a\r\nstrong government which will neither degenerate into despotism nor\r\nbecome corrupt by the uninterrupted enjoyment of power. The true value\r\nof the representative system will thus become rapidly known to Mexico\r\nas she develops her resources, by the united, constitutional, and\r\npeaceful movement of her state and national machinery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong all the agitators of the country no one has been, by turns, so\r\nmuch courted and dreaded as Santa Anna. His political history,\r\nsketched in this volume, discloses many but not all the features of\r\nhis private character. He possessed a wilful, observant, patient\r\nintellect, which had received very little culture; but constant\r\nintercourse with all classes of men, made him perfectly familiar with\r\nthe strength and weaknesses of his countrymen. There was not a person\r\nof note in the Republic whose value he did not know, nor was there a\r\nvenal politician with whose price he was unacquainted. Believing most\r\nmen corrupt or corruptible, he was constantly busy in contriving\r\nexpedients to control or win them. A soldier almost from his infancy,\r\nduring turbulent times among semi-civilized troops, he had become so\r\nhabitually despotic that when he left the camp for the cabinet he\r\nstill blent the imperious General with the intriguing President. He\r\nseemed to cherish the idea that his country could not be virtuously\r\ngoverned. Ambitious, and avaricious, he sought for power not only to\r\ngratify his individual lust of personal glory, but as a means of\r\nenriching himself and purchasing the instruments who might sustain his\r\nauthority. Accordingly, he rarely distinguished the public treasure\r\nfrom his private funds. Soldier as he was by profession, he was\r\nslightly skilled in the duties of a commander in the field, and never\r\nwon a great battle except through the blunders of his opponents. He\r\nwas a systematic revolutionist; a manager of men; an astute\r\nintriguer;--and, personally timid, he seldom meditated an advance\r\nwithout planning a retreat. Covetous as a miser, he nevertheless,\r\ndelighted to watch the mean combat between fowls upon whose prowess he\r\nhad staked his thousands. An agriculturist with vast landed\r\npossessions, his chief rural pleasure was in training these birds for\r\nthe brutal battle of the pit. Loving money insatiably, he leaned with\r\nthe eagerness of a gambler over the table where those who knew how to\r\npropitiate his greediness learned the graceful art of losing\r\njudiciously. Sensual by constitution, he valued woman only as the\r\nminister of his pleasures. The gentlest being imaginable in tone,\r\naddress, and demeanor to foreigners or his equals, he was oppressively\r\nhaughty to his inferiors, unless they were necessary to his purposes\r\nor not absolutely in his power. The correspondence and public papers\r\nwhich were either written or dictated by him, fully displayed the\r\nsophistry by which he changed defeats into victories or converted\r\ncriminal faults into philanthropy. Gifted with an extraordinary power\r\nof expression, he used his splendid language to impose by sonorous\r\nperiods, upon the credulity or fancy of his people. No one excelled\r\nhim in ingenuity, eloquence, bombast, gasconade or dialectic skill.\r\nWhen at the head of power, he lived constantly in a gorgeous military\r\npageant; and, a perfect master of dramatic effect upon the excitable\r\nmasses of his countrymen, he forgot the exhumation of the dishonored\r\nbones of Cortéz to superintend the majestic interment of the limb he\r\nhad lost at Vera Cruz.[78]\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood how such a man, in the revolutionary times\r\nof Mexico, became neither the Cromwell nor the Washington of his\r\ncountry. The great talent which he unquestionably possessed, taught him\r\nthat it was easier to deal corruptly with corruptions than to rise to\r\nthe dignity of a loyal reformer. He and his country mutually acted, and\r\nreacted upon each other. Neither a student nor a traveller, he knew\r\nnothing of human character except as he saw it exhibited at home, and\r\nthere he certainly sometimes found excuses for severity and even\r\ndespotism. It is undeniable that he was endowed with a peculiar genius,\r\nbut it was that kind of energetic genius which may raise a dexterous man\r\nfrom disgrace, defeat or reverses, rather than sustain him in power when\r\nhe has reached it. He never was popular or relied for success on the\r\ndemocratic sentiment of his country. He ascertained, at an early day,\r\nthat the people would not favor his aspirations, and, abandoning\r\nfederalism, he threw himself in the embrace of the centralists. The army\r\nand the church-establishment,--combined for mutual protection under his\r\nauspices,--were the only two elements of his political strength; and as\r\nlong as he wielded their mingled power, he was enabled to do more than\r\nany other Mexican in thoroughly demoralizing his country. As a military\r\ndemagogue he was often valuable even to honest patriots who were willing\r\nto call him to power for a moment to save the country either from\r\nanarchy or from the grasp of more dangerous aspirants. Until the army\r\nwas destroyed, Santa Anna could not fall, nor would the military\r\npoliticians yield to the civil. As long as this dangerous chief and his\r\nmyrmidons remained in Mexico, either in or out of power, every citizen\r\nfelt that he was suffering under the rod of a Despot or that the\r\nprogress of his country would soon be paralyzed by the wand of an\r\nunprincipled Agitator. But with the army reduced to the mere\r\nrequirements of a police system, and Santa Anna beyond the limits of the\r\nRepublic, the nation may breathe with freedom and vigor.[79]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--These historical sketches of the late war with Mexico are\r\n    designed to present a rapid view of the chief _events_ and\r\n    _motives_ of the international conflict rather than to portray the\r\n    separate actions of civil and military men who were engaged in it.\r\n    We have, therefore, not been as minute as might be desired either\r\n    by ourself or by interested individuals. This, however, will be\r\n    remedied in the general \"History of the War between Mexico and the\r\n    United States,\" which we design publishing.\r\n\r\n    In narrating the battles we have sketched them _according to the\r\n    published plans of the commanders on both sides_. This is the fair\r\n    system of describing and judging; but whether those plans _were\r\n    always the most judicious_, is a matter for military criticism in\r\n    which we have not present space to indulge. Resaca de la Palma,\r\n    Monterey, Buena Vista, Vera Cruz, Molino del Rey, Chapultepec, and\r\n    the _time_ as well as the _mode_ of capturing the capital, have\r\n    all been discussed and condemned by the prolific class of fault\r\n    finders--most of whose judgments, when at all correct, are founded\r\n    upon knowledge acquired or assured subsequently to the actions,\r\n    and which was entirely inaccessible to the commanders when they\r\n    fought the battles that are criticised. One thing, however, should\r\n    gratify our Generals exceedingly, and it is that in truth they\r\n    _did_ fight and _win_ the several actions in question,\r\n    notwithstanding their blunders and notwithstanding the fact that\r\n    their junior civil and military critics could have fought them so\r\n    much better! They had, it seems, a double triumph--one over their\r\n    own stupid ignorance and another over the enemy!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: In his letter to the Secretary of War on the 1st of\r\nFebruary from Cascatlan, he says: \"to enable me to live out of the way\r\nof the banditti travelling about here in large parties, I have had to\r\nspend more than two thousand dollars, necessary to maintain a small\r\nescort, when, through the scarcity of means in the treasury, _I served\r\nmy country without pay_.\" This is a singular illustration of Santa\r\nAnna's characteristic avarice. Perhaps no man ever served his country\r\nfor more liberal and certain pay than this chieftain. We have been\r\ninformed by one of our highest officers, who was in the capital after\r\nits occupation by our troops, and had access to the Mexican archives,\r\nthat, amid all Santa Anna's political and military distresses he never\r\nforgot his pecuniary interests. The books of the treasury showed that,\r\nat the moment when the city was about to fall and when there was\r\nscarcely money enough to maintain the troops, _he paid himself the\r\nwhole of his salary as President up to that date, and all the arrears\r\nwhich he claimed as due to him, as President also, during the period\r\nof his residence in exile at Havana_!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: See page 91, vol. 1, and Mexico as it was and as it is,\r\np 207.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: See vol. 2, chapter xii, p. 155.
