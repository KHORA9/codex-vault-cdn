The aim of the translator\r\nhas been above all things faithfulness—faithfulness to the manner of\r\nexpression and to the structure of sentences, as well as to the meaning\r\nof the Author. At the same time it is conceived that the freedom and\r\nvariety of Herodotus is not always best reproduced by such severe\r\nconsistency of rendering as is perhaps desirable in the case of the Epic\r\nwriters before and the philosophical writers after his time: nor again\r\nmust his simplicity of thought and occasional quaintness be reproduced\r\nin the form of archaisms of language; and that not only because the\r\naffectation of an archaic style would necessarily be offensive to the\r\nreader, but also because in language Herodotus is not archaic. His style\r\nis the \"best canon of the Ionic speech,\" marked, however, not so much\r\nby primitive purity as by eclectic variety. At the same time it is\r\ncharacterised largely by the poetic diction of the Epic and Tragic\r\nwriters; and while the translator is free to employ all the resources of\r\nmodern English, so far as he has them at his command, he must carefully\r\nretain this poetical colouring and by all means avoid the courtier\r\nphrase by which the style of Herodotus has too often been made \"more\r\nnoble.\" 331\r\n\r\nAs regards the text from which this translation has been made, it is\r\nbased upon that of Stein's critical edition (Berlin, 1869-1871), that\r\nis to say the estimate there made of the comparative value of the\r\nauthorities has been on the whole accepted as a just one, rather than\r\nthat which depreciates the value of the Medicean MS. and of the class to\r\nwhich it belongs. On the other hand the conjectural emendations proposed\r\nby Stein have very seldom been adopted, and his text has been departed\r\nfrom in a large number of other instances also, which will for the most\r\npart be found recorded in the notes.\r\n\r\nAs it seemed that even after Stein's re-collation of the Medicean MS.\r\nthere were doubts felt by some scholars 332 as to the true reading in\r\nsome places of this MS., which is very generally acknowledged to be the\r\nmost important, I thought it right to examine it myself in all those\r\npassages where questions about text arise which concern a translator,\r\nthat is in nearly five hundred places altogether; and the results, when\r\nthey are worth observing, are recorded in the notes. At the same time,\r\nby the suggestion of Dr. Stein, I re-collated a large part of the third\r\nbook in the MS. which is commonly referred to as F (i.e. Florentinus),\r\ncalled by Stein C, and I examined this MS. also in a certain number\r\nof other places. It should be understood that wherever in the notes I\r\nmention the reading of any particular MS. by name, I do so on my own\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe notes have been confined to a tolerably small compass. Their purpose\r\nis, first, in cases where the text is doubtful, to indicate the\r\nreading adopted by the translator and any other which may seem to have\r\nreasonable probability, but without discussion of the authorities;\r\nsecondly, where the rendering is not quite literal (and in other cases\r\nwhere it seemed desirable), to quote the words of the original or to\r\ngive a more literal version; thirdly, to add an alternative version\r\nin cases where there seems to be a doubt as to the true meaning; and\r\nlastly, to give occasionally a short explanation, or a reference from\r\none passage of the author to another.\r\n\r\nFor the orthography of proper names reference may be made to the note\r\nprefixed to the index. No consistent system has been adopted, and the\r\nresult will therefore be open to criticism in many details; but the aim\r\nhas been to avoid on the one hand the pedantry of seriously altering the\r\nform of those names which are fairly established in the English language\r\nof literature, as distinguished from that of scholarship, and on the\r\nother hand the absurdity of looking to Latin rather than to Greek for\r\nthe orthography of the names which are not so established. There is no\r\nintention to put forward any theory about pronunciation.\r\n\r\nThe index of proper names will, it is hoped, be found more complete\r\nand accurate than those hitherto published. The best with which I was\r\nacquainted I found to have so many errors and omissions 333 that I was\r\ncompelled to do the work again from the beginning. In a collection\r\nof more than ten thousand references there must in all probability be\r\nmistakes, but I trust they will be found to be few.\r\n\r\nMy acknowledgments of obligation are due first to Dr. Stein, both for\r\nhis critical work and also for his most excellent commentary, which I\r\nhave had always by me. After this I have made most use of the editions\r\nof Krüger, Bähr, Abicht, and (in the first two books) Mr. Woods. As to\r\ntranslations, I have had Rawlinson's before me while revising my own\r\nwork, and I have referred also occasionally to the translations of\r\nLittlebury (perhaps the best English version as regards style, but full\r\nof gross errors), Taylor, and Larcher. In the second book I have also\r\nused the version of B. R. reprinted by Mr. Lang: of the first book of\r\nthis translation I have access only to a fragment written out some\r\nyears ago, when the British Museum was within my reach. Other particular\r\nobligations are acknowledged in the notes.\r\n\r\n—————\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO PREFACE\r\n\r\n331 [ See the remarks of P.-L. Courier (on Larcher's version) in the\r\npreface to his specimens of a new translation of Herodotus (OEuvres\r\ncomplètes de P.-L. Courier, Bruxelles, 1828).]\r\n\r\n332 [ Mr. Woods, for example, in his edition of the first book\r\n(published in 1873) gives a list of readings for the first and second\r\nbooks, in which he almost invariably prefers the authority of Gronovius\r\nto that of Stein, where their reports differ. In so doing he is wrong\r\nin all cases (I think) except one, namely i. 134 {to degomeno}. He is\r\nwrong, for examine, in i. 189, where the MS. has {touto}, i. 196 {an\r\nagesthai}, i. 199 {odon}, ii. 15 {te de}, ii. 95 {up auto}, ii. 103 {kai\r\nprosotata}, ii. 124 {to addo} (without {dao}), ii. 181 {no}. Abicht also\r\nhas made several inaccurate statements, e.g. i. 185, where the MS. has\r\n{es ton Euphreten}, and vii. 133 {Xerxes}.]\r\n\r\n333 [ For example in the index of proper names attached to Stein's\r\nannotated edition (Berlin, 1882), to which I am under obligation, having\r\nchecked my own by it, I find that I have marked upwards of two hundred\r\nmistakes or oversights: no doubt I have been saved by it from at least\r\nas many.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF HERODOTUS\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED CLIO\r\n\r\nThis is the Showing forth of the Inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassos,\r\nto the end that 1 neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse\r\nof time, nor the works 2 great and marvellous, which have been produced\r\nsome by Hellenes and some by Barbarians, may lose their renown; and\r\nespecially that the causes may be remembered for which these waged war\r\nwith one another.\r\n\r\n1. Those of the Persians who have knowledge of history declare that\r\nthe Phenicians first began the quarrel. These, they say, came from that\r\nwhich is called the Erythraian Sea to this of ours; and having settled\r\nin the land where they continue even now to dwell, set themselves\r\nforthwith to make long voyages by sea. And conveying merchandise of\r\nEgypt and of Assyria they arrived at other places and also at Argos; now\r\nArgos was at that time in all points the first of the States within that\r\nland which is now called Hellas;—the Phenicians arrived then at this\r\nland of Argos, and began to dispose of their ship's cargo: and on the\r\nfifth or sixth day after they had arrived, when their goods had been\r\nalmost all sold, there came down to the sea a great company of women,\r\nand among them the daughter of the king; and her name, as the Hellenes\r\nalso agree, was Io the daughter of Inachos. These standing near to the\r\nstern of the ship were buying of the wares such as pleased them most,\r\nwhen of a sudden the Phenicians, passing the word from one to another,\r\nmade a rush upon them; and the greater part of the women escaped by\r\nflight, but Io and certain others were carried off. So they put them on\r\nboard their ship, and forthwith departed, sailing away to Egypt.\r\n\r\n2. In this manner the Persians report that Io came to Egypt, not\r\nagreeing therein with the Hellenes, 3 and this they say was the first\r\nbeginning of wrongs. Then after this, they say, certain Hellenes (but\r\nthe name of the people they are not able to report) put in to the city\r\nof Tyre in Phenicia and carried off the king's daughter Europa;—these\r\nwould doubtless be Cretans;—and so they were quits for the former\r\ninjury. After this however the Hellenes, they say, were the authors of\r\nthe second wrong; for they sailed in to Aia of Colchis and to the river\r\nPhasis with a ship of war, and from thence, after they had done the\r\nother business for which they came, they carried off the king's daughter\r\nMedea: and the king of Colchis sent a herald to the land of Hellas and\r\ndemanded satisfaction for the rape and to have his daughter back; but\r\nthey answered that, as the Barbarians had given them no satisfaction for\r\nthe rape of Io the Argive, so neither would they give satisfaction to\r\nthe Barbarians for this.\r\n\r\n3. In the next generation after this, they say, Alexander the son of\r\nPriam, having heard of these things, desired to get a wife for himself\r\nby violence 4 from Hellas, being fully assured that he would not be\r\ncompelled to give any satisfaction for this wrong, inasmuch as the\r\nHellenes gave none for theirs. So he carried off Helen, and the\r\nHellenes resolved to send messengers first and to demand her back with\r\nsatisfaction for the rape; and when they put forth this demand, the\r\nothers alleged to them the rape of Medea, saying that the Hellenes were\r\nnow desiring satisfaction to be given to them by others, though they\r\nhad given none themselves nor had surrendered the person when demand was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n4. Up to this point, they say, nothing more happened than the carrying\r\naway of women on both sides; but after this the Hellenes were very\r\ngreatly to blame; for they set the first example of war, making an\r\nexpedition into Asia before the Barbarians made any into Europe. Now\r\nthey say that in their judgment, though it is an act of wrong to\r\ncarry away women by force, it is a folly to set one's heart on taking\r\nvengeance for their rape, and the wise course is to pay no regard when\r\nthey have been carried away; for it is evident that they would never be\r\ncarried away if they were not themselves willing to go. And the Persians\r\nsay that they, namely the people of Asia, when their women were carried\r\naway by force, had made it a matter of no account, but the Hellenes on\r\naccount of a woman of Lacedemon gathered together a great armament, and\r\nthen came to Asia and destroyed the dominion of Priam; and that from\r\nthis time forward they had always considered the Hellenic race to be\r\ntheir enemy: for Asia and the Barbarian races which dwell there the\r\nPersians claim as belonging to them; but Europe and the Hellenic race\r\nthey consider to be parted off from them.\r\n\r\n5. The Persians for their part say that things happened thus; and they\r\nconclude that the beginning of their quarrel with the Hellenes was on\r\naccount of the taking of Ilion: but as regards Io the Phenicians do not\r\nagree with the Persians in telling the tale thus; for they deny that\r\nthey carried her off to Egypt by violent means, and they say on the\r\nother hand that when they were in Argos she was intimate with the master\r\nof their ship, and perceiving that she was with child, she was ashamed\r\nto confess it to her parents, and therefore sailed away with the\r\nPhenicians of her own will, for fear of being found out. These are the\r\ntales told by the Persians and the Phenicians severally: and concerning\r\nthese things I am not going to say that they happened thus or thus, 401\r\nbut when I have pointed to the man who first within my own knowledge\r\nbegan to commit wrong against the Hellenes, I shall go forward further\r\nwith the story, giving an account of the cities of men, small as well\r\nas great: for those which in old times were great have for the most part\r\nbecome small, while those that were in my own time great used in former\r\ntimes to be small: so then, since I know that human prosperity never\r\ncontinues steadfast, I shall make mention of both indifferently.\r\n\r\n6. Croesus was Lydian by race, the son of Alyattes and ruler of the\r\nnations which dwell on this side of the river Halys; which river,\r\nflowing from the South between the Syrians 5 and the Paphlagonians, runs\r\nout towards the North Wind into that Sea which is called the Euxine.\r\nThis Croesus, first of all the Barbarians of whom we have knowledge,\r\nsubdued certain of the Hellenes and forced them to pay tribute, while\r\nothers he gained over and made them his friends. Those whom he subdued\r\nwere the Ionians, the Aiolians, and the Dorians who dwell in Asia; and\r\nthose whom he made his friends were the Lacedemonians. But before the\r\nreign of Croesus all the Hellenes were free; for the expedition of the\r\nKimmerians, which came upon Ionia before the time of Croesus, was not a\r\nconquest of the cities but a plundering incursion only. 6\r\n\r\n7. Now the supremacy which had belonged to the Heracleidai came to the\r\nfamily of Croesus, called Mermnadai, in the following manner:—Candaules,\r\nwhom the Hellenes call Myrsilos, was ruler of Sardis and a descendant of\r\nAlcaios, son of Heracles: for Agron, the son of Ninos, the son of Belos,\r\nthe son of Alcaios, was the first of the Heracleidai who became king of\r\nSardis, and Candaules the son of Myrsos was the last; but those who were\r\nkings over this land before Agron, were descendants of Lydos the son\r\nof Atys, whence this whole nation was called Lydian, having been before\r\ncalled Meonian. From these the Heracleidai, descended from Heracles and\r\nthe slave-girl of Iardanos, obtained the government, being charged\r\nwith it by reason of an oracle; and they reigned for two-and-twenty\r\ngenerations of men, five hundred and five years, handing on the power\r\nfrom father to son, till the time of Candaules the son of Myrsos.\r\n\r\n8. This Candaules then of whom I speak had become passionately in love\r\nwith his own wife; and having become so, he deemed that his wife was\r\nfairer by far than all other women; and thus deeming, to Gyges the son\r\nof Daskylos (for he of all his spearmen was the most pleasing to him),\r\nto this Gyges, I say, he used to impart as well the more weighty of his\r\naffairs as also the beauty of his wife, praising it above measure: and\r\nafter no long time, since it was destined that evil should happen to\r\nCandaules, he said to Gyges as follows: \"Gyges, I think that thou dost\r\nnot believe me when I tell thee of the beauty of my wife, for it\r\nhappens that men's ears are less apt of belief than their eyes: contrive\r\ntherefore means by which thou mayest look upon her naked.\" But he cried\r\naloud and said: \"Master, what word of unwisdom is this which thou dost\r\nutter, bidding me look upon my mistress naked? When a woman puts off\r\nher tunic she puts off her modesty also. Moreover of old time those fair\r\nsayings have been found out by men, from which we ought to learn wisdom;\r\nand of these one is this,—that each man should look on his own: but I\r\nbelieve indeed that she is of all women the fairest and I entreat thee\r\nnot to ask of me that which it is not lawful for me to do.\"\r\n\r\n9. With such words as these he resisted, fearing lest some evil might\r\ncome to him from this; but the king answered him thus: \"Be of good\r\ncourage, Gyges, and have no fear, either of me, that I am saying these\r\nwords to try thee, or of my wife, lest any harm may happen to thee from\r\nher. For I will contrive it so from the first that she shall not even\r\nperceive that she has been seen by thee. I will place thee in the room\r\nwhere we sleep, behind the open door; 7 and after I have gone in, my\r\nwife also will come to lie down. Now there is a seat near the entrance\r\nof the room, and upon this she will lay her garments as she takes\r\nthem off one by one; and so thou wilt be able to gaze upon her at full\r\nleisure. And when she goes from the chair to the bed and thou shalt be\r\nbehind her back, then let it be thy part to take care that she sees thee\r\nnot as thou goest through the door.\"\r\n\r\n10. He then, since he might not avoid it, gave consent: and Candaules,\r\nwhen he considered that it was time to rest, led Gyges to the chamber;\r\nand straightway after this the woman also appeared: and Gyges looked\r\nupon her after she came in and as she laid down her garments; and when\r\nshe had her back turned towards him, as she went to the bed, then he\r\nslipped away from his hiding-place and was going forth. And as he went\r\nout, the woman caught sight of him, and perceiving that which had been\r\ndone by her husband she did not cry out, though struck with shame, 8 but\r\nshe made as though she had not perceived the matter, meaning to avenge\r\nherself upon Candaules: for among the Lydians as also among most other\r\nBarbarians it is a shame even for a man to be seen naked.\r\n\r\n11. At the time then she kept silence, as I say, and made no outward\r\nsign; but as soon as day had dawned, and she made ready those of the\r\nservants whom she perceived to be the most attached to herself, and\r\nafter that she sent to summon Gyges. He then, not supposing that\r\nanything of that which had been done was known to her, came upon her\r\nsummons; for he had been accustomed before to go 9 whenever the queen\r\nsummoned him. And when Gyges was come, the woman said to him these\r\nwords: \"There are now two ways open to thee, Gyges, and I give thee the\r\nchoice which of the two thou wilt prefer to take. Either thou must slay\r\nCandaules and possess both me and the kingdom of Lydia, or thou must\r\nthyself here on the spot be slain, so that thou mayest not in future,\r\nby obeying Candaules in all things, see that which thou shouldest not.\r\nEither he must die who formed this design, or thou who hast looked upon\r\nme naked and done that which is not accounted lawful.\" For a time then\r\nGyges was amazed at these words, and afterwards he began to entreat her\r\nthat she would not bind him by necessity to make such a choice: then\r\nhowever, as he could not prevail with her, but saw that necessity was in\r\ntruth set before him either to slay his master or to be himself slain by\r\nothers, he made the choice to live himself; and he inquired further as\r\nfollows: \"Since thou dost compel me to take my master's life against\r\nmy own will, let me hear from thee also what is the manner in which we\r\nshall lay hands upon him.\" And she answering said: \"From that same place\r\nshall the attempt be, where he displayed me naked; and we will lay hands\r\nupon him as he sleeps.\"\r\n\r\n12. So after they had prepared the plot, when night came on, (for Gyges\r\nwas not let go nor was there any way of escape for him, but he must\r\neither be slain himself or slay Candaules), he followed the woman to the\r\nbedchamber; and she gave him a dagger and concealed him behind that very\r\nsame door. Then afterwards, while Candaules was sleeping, Gyges came\r\nprivily up to him 10 and slew him, and he obtained both his wife and his\r\nkingdom: of him moreover Archilochos the Parian, who lived about that\r\ntime, made mention in a trimeter iambic verse. 11\r\n\r\n13. He obtained the kingdom however and was strengthened in it by means\r\nof the Oracle at Delphi; for when the Lydians were angry because of the\r\nfate of Candaules, and had risen in arms, a treaty was made between the\r\nfollowers of Gyges and the other Lydians to this effect, that if the\r\nOracle should give answer that he was to be king of the Lydians, he\r\nshould be king, and if not, he should give back the power to the sons of\r\nHeracles. So the Oracle gave answer, and Gyges accordingly became\r\nking: yet the Pythian prophetess said this also, that vengeance for\r\nthe Heracleidai should come upon the descendants of Gyges in the fifth\r\ngeneration. Of this oracle the Lydians and their kings made no account\r\nuntil it was in fact fulfilled.\r\n\r\n14. Thus the Mermnadai obtained the government having driven out from it\r\nthe Heracleidai: and Gyges when he became ruler sent votive offerings to\r\nDelphi not a few, for of all the silver offerings at Delphi his are more\r\nin number than those of any other man; and besides the silver he offered\r\na vast quantity of gold, and especially one offering which is more\r\nworthy of mention than the rest, namely six golden mixing-bowls, which\r\nare dedicated there as his gift: of these the weight is thirty talents,\r\nand they stand in the treasury of the Corinthians, (though in truth this\r\ntreasury does not belong to the State of the Corinthians, but is that\r\nof Kypselos the son of Aëtion). 12 This Gyges was the first of the\r\nBarbarians within our knowledge who dedicated votive offerings at\r\nDelphi, except only Midas the son of Gordias king of Phrygia, who\r\ndedicated for an offering the royal throne on which he sat before all to\r\ndecide causes; and this throne, a sight worth seeing, stands in the\r\nsame place with the bowls of Gyges. This gold and silver which Gyges\r\ndedicated is called Gygian by the people of Delphi, after the name of\r\nhim who offered it.\r\n\r\nNow Gyges also, 13 as soon as he became king, led an army against\r\nMiletos and Smyrna, and he took the lower town of Colophon: 14 but no\r\nother great deed did he do in his reign, which lasted eight-and-thirty\r\nyears, therefore we will pass him by with no more mention than has\r\nalready been made,\r\n\r\n15, and I will speak now of Ardys the son of Gyges, who became king\r\nafter Gyges. He took Priene and made an invasion against Miletos; and\r\nwhile he was ruling over Sardis, the Kimmerians driven from their abodes\r\nby the nomad Scythians came to Asia and took Sardis except the citadel.\r\n\r\n16. Now when Ardys had been king for nine-and-forty years, Sadyattes his\r\nson succeeded to his kingdom, and reigned twelve years; and after him\r\nAlyattes. This last made war against Kyaxares the descendant of Deïokes\r\nand against the Medes, 15 and he drove the Kimmerians forth out of Asia,\r\nand he took Smyrna which had been founded from Colophon, and made an\r\ninvasion against Clazomenai. From this he ed not as he desired, but\r\nwith great loss: during his reign however he performed other deeds very\r\nworthy of mention as follows:—\r\n\r\n17. He made war with those of Miletos, having received this war as\r\nan inheritance from his father: for he used to invade their land and\r\nbesiege Miletos in the following manner:—whenever there were ripe crops\r\nupon the land, then he led an army into their confines, making his march\r\nto the sound of pipes and harps and flutes both of male and female tone:\r\nand when he came to the Milesian land, he neither pulled down the houses\r\nthat were in the fields, nor set fire to them nor tore off their doors,\r\nbut let them stand as they were; the trees however and the crops that\r\nwere upon the land he destroyed, and then departed by the way he came:\r\nfor the men of Miletos had command of the sea, so that it was of no use\r\nfor his army to blockade them: and he abstained from pulling down the\r\nhouses to the end that the Milesians might have places to dwell in while\r\nthey sowed and tilled the land, and by the means of their labour he\r\nmight have somewhat to destroy when he made his invasion.\r\n\r\n18. Thus he continued to war with them for eleven years; and in the\r\ncourse of these years the Milesians suffered two great defeats, once\r\nwhen they fought a battle in the district of Limenion in their own land,\r\nand again in the plain of Maiander. Now for six of the eleven years\r\nSadyattes the son of Ardys was still ruler of the Lydians, the same who\r\nwas wont to invade the land of Miletos at the times mentioned; 16 for\r\nthis Sadyattes was he who first began the war: but for the five years\r\nwhich followed these first six the war was carried on by Alyattes the\r\nson of Sadyattes, who received it as an inheritance from his father (as\r\nI have already said) and applied himself to it earnestly. And none of\r\nthe Ionians helped those of Miletos bear the burden of this war except\r\nonly the men of Chios. These came to their aid to pay back like with\r\nlike, for the Milesians had formerly assisted the Chians throughout\r\ntheir war with the people of Erythrai.\r\n\r\n19. Then in the twelfth year of the war, when standing corn was being\r\nburnt by the army of the Lydians, it happened as follows:—as soon as the\r\ncorn was kindled, it was driven by a violent wind and set fire to the\r\ntemple of Athene surnamed of Assessos; and the temple being set on fire\r\nwas burnt down to the ground. Of this no account was made then; but\r\nafterwards when the army had ed to Sardis, Alyattes fell sick, and as\r\nhis sickness lasted long, he sent messengers to inquire of the Oracle at\r\nDelphi, either being advised to do so by some one, or because he himself\r\nthought it best to send and inquire of the god concerning his sickness.\r\nBut when these arrived at Delphi, the Pythian prophetess said that she\r\nwould give them no answer, until they should have built up again\r\nthe temple of Athene which they had burnt at Assessos in the land of\r\nMiletos.\r\n\r\n20. Thus much I know by the report of the people of Delphi; but the\r\nMilesians add to this that Periander the son of Kypselos, being a\r\nspecial guest-friend of Thrasybulos the then despot of Miletos, heard\r\nof the oracle which had been given to Alyattes, and sending a messenger\r\ntold Thrasybulos, in order that he might have knowledge of it beforehand\r\nand take such counsel as the case required. This is the story told by\r\nthe Milesians.\r\n\r\n21. And Alyattes, when this answer was reported to him, sent a herald\r\nforthwith to Miletos, desiring to make a truce with Thrasybulos and the\r\nMilesians for so long a time as he should be building the temple. He\r\nthen was being sent as envoy to Miletos; and Thrasybulos in the meantime\r\nbeing informed beforehand of the whole matter and knowing what Alyattes\r\nwas meaning to do, contrived this device:—he gathered together in the\r\nmarket-place all the store of provisions which was found in the\r\ncity, both his own and that which belonged to private persons; and he\r\nproclaimed to the Milesians that on a signal given by him they should\r\nall begin to drink and make merry with one another.\r\n\r\n22. This Thrasybulos did and thus proclaimed to the end that the herald\r\nfrom Sardis, seeing a vast quantity of provisions carelessly piled up,\r\nand the people feasting, might report this to Alyattes: and so on fact\r\nit happened; for when the herald ed to Sardis after seeing this and\r\ndelivering to Thrasybulos the charge which was given to him by the king\r\nof Lydia, the peace which was made, came about, as I am informed, merely\r\nbecause of this. For Alyattes, who thought that there was a great famine\r\nin Miletos and that the people had been worn down to the extreme of\r\nmisery, heard from the herald, when he ed from Miletos, the opposite\r\nto that which he himself supposed. And after this the peace was made\r\nbetween them on condition of being guest-friends and allies to one\r\nanother, and Alyattes built two temples to Athene at Assessos in place\r\nof one, and himself recovered from his sickness. With regard then to\r\nthe war waged by Alyattes with the Milesians and Thrasybulos things went\r\nthus.\r\n\r\n23. As for Periander, the man who gave information about the oracle to\r\nThrasybulos, he was the son of Kypselos, and despot of Corinth. In his\r\nlife, say the Corinthians, (and with them agree the Lesbians), there\r\nhappened to him a very great marvel, namely that Arion of Methymna was\r\ncarried ashore at Tainaron upon a dolphin's back. This man was a harper\r\nsecond to none of those who then lived, and the first, so far as we\r\nknow, who composed a dithyramb, naming it so and teaching it to a chorus\r\n17 at Corinth.\r\n\r\n24. This Arion, they say, who for the most part of his time stayed with\r\nPeriander, conceived a desire to sail to Italy 18 and Sicily; and\r\nafter he had there acquired large sums of money, he wished to again to\r\nCorinth. He set forth therefore from Taras, 19 and as he had faith\r\nin Corinthians more than in other men, he hired a ship with a crew of\r\nCorinthians. These, the story says, when out in open sea, formed a\r\nplot to cast Arion overboard and so possess his wealth; and he having\r\nobtained knowledge of this made entreaties to them, offering them his\r\nwealth and asking them to grant him his life. With this however he\r\ndid not prevail upon them, but the men who were conveying him bade him\r\neither slay himself there, that he might receive burial on the land,\r\nor leap straightway into the sea. So Arion being driven to a strait\r\nentreated them that, since they were so minded, they would allow him to\r\ntake his stand in full minstrel's garb upon the deck 20 of the ship and\r\nsing; and he promised to put himself to death after he had sung. They\r\nthen, well pleased to think that they should hear the best of all\r\nminstrels upon earth, drew back from the stern towards the middle of\r\nthe ship; and he put on the full minstrel's garb and took his lyre, and\r\nstanding on the deck performed the Orthian measure. Then as the measure\r\nended, he threw himself into the sea just as he was, in his full\r\nminstrel's garb; and they went on sailing away to Corinth, but him,\r\nthey say, a dolphin supported on its back and brought him to shore at\r\nTainaron: and when he had come to land he proceeded to Corinth with his\r\nminstrel's garb. Thither having arrived he related all that had been\r\ndone; and Periander doubting of his story kept Arion in guard and\r\nwould let him go nowhere, while he kept careful watch for those who had\r\nconveyed him. When these came, he called them and inquired of them if\r\nthey had any report to make of Arion; and when they said that he was\r\nsafe in Italy and that they had left him at Taras faring well, Arion\r\nsuddenly appeared before them in the same guise as when he made his leap\r\nfrom the ship; and they being struck with amazement were no longer\r\nable to deny when they were questioned. This is the tale told by the\r\nCorinthians and Lesbians alike, and there is at Tainaron a votive\r\noffering of Arion of no great size, 21 namely a bronze figure of a man\r\nupon a dolphin's back.\r\n\r\n25. Alyattes the Lydian, when he had thus waged war against the\r\nMilesians, afterwards died, having reigned seven-and-fifty years. This\r\nking, when he recovered from his sickness, dedicated a votive offering\r\nat Delphi (being the second of his house who had so done), namely a\r\ngreat mixing-bowl of silver with a stand for it of iron welded together,\r\nwhich last is a sight worth seeing above all the offerings at Delphi and\r\nthe work of Glaucos the Chian, who of all men first found out the art of\r\nwelding iron.\r\n\r\n26. After Alyattes was dead Croesus the son of Alyattes received the\r\nkingdom in succession, being five-and-thirty years of age. He (as I\r\nsaid) fought against the Hellenes and of them he attacked the Ephesians\r\nfirst. The Ephesians then, being besieged by him, dedicated their city\r\nto Artemis and tied a rope from the temple to the wall of the city: now\r\nthe distance between the ancient city, which was then being besieged,\r\nand the temple is seven furlongs. 22 These, I say, were the first upon\r\nwhom Croesus laid hands, but afterwards he did the same to the other\r\nIonian and Aiolian cities one by one, alleging against them various\r\ncauses of complaint, and making serious charges against those in whose\r\ncases he could find serious grounds, while against others of them he\r\ncharged merely trifling offences.\r\n\r\n27. Then when the Hellenes in Asia had been conquered and forced to pay\r\ntribute, he designed next to build for himself ships and to lay hands\r\nupon those who dwelt in the islands; and when all was prepared for\r\nhis building of ships, they say that Bias of Priene (or, according to\r\nanother account, Pittacos of Mytilene) came to Sardis, and being asked\r\nby Croesus whether there was any new thing doing in Hellas, brought to\r\nan end his building of ships by this saying: \"O king,\" said he, \"the men\r\nof the islands are hiring a troop of ten thousand horse, and with this\r\nthey mean to march to Sardis and fight against thee.\" And Croesus,\r\nsupposing that what he reported was true, said: \"May the gods put\r\nit into the minds of the dwellers of the islands to come with horses\r\nagainst the sons of the Lydians!\" And he answered and said: \"O king, I\r\nperceive that thou dost earnestly desire to catch the men of the islands\r\non the mainland riding upon horses; and it is not unreasonable that thou\r\nshouldest wish for this: what else however thinkest thou the men of the\r\nislands desire and have been praying for ever since the time they heard\r\nthat thou wert about to build ships against them, than that they might\r\ncatch the Lydians upon the sea, so as to take vengeance upon thee for\r\nthe Hellenes who dwell upon the mainland, whom thou dost hold enslaved?\"\r\nCroesus, they say, was greatly pleased with this conclusion, 23 and\r\nobeying his suggestion, for he judged him to speak suitably, he stopped\r\nhis building of ships; and upon that he formed a friendship with the\r\nIonians dwelling in the islands.\r\n\r\n28. As time went on, when nearly all those dwelling on this side the\r\nriver Halys had been subdued, (for except the Kilikians and Lykians\r\nCroesus subdued and kept under his rule all the nations, that is to say\r\nLydians, Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandynoi, Chalybians, Paphlagonians,\r\nThracians both Thynian and Bithynian, Carians, Ionians, Dorians,\r\nAiolians, and Pamphylians), 24\r\n\r\n29, when these, I say, had been subdued, and while he was still adding\r\nto his Lydian dominions, there came to Sardis, then at the height of\r\nits wealth, all the wise men 25 of the Hellas who chanced to be alive at\r\nthat time, brought thither severally by various occasions; and of them\r\none was Solon the Athenian, who after he had made laws for the Athenians\r\nat their bidding, left his native country for ten years and sailed away\r\nsaying that he desired to visit various lands, in order that he might\r\nnot be compelled to repeal any of the laws which he had proposed. 26 For\r\nof themselves the Athenians were not competent to do this, having bound\r\nthemselves by solemn oaths to submit for ten years to the laws which\r\nSolon should propose for them.\r\n\r\n30. So Solon, having left his native country for this reason and for\r\nthe sake of seeing various lands, came to Amasis in Egypt, and also to\r\nCroesus at Sardis. Having there arrived he was entertained as a guest\r\nby Croesus in the king's palace; and afterwards, on the third or fourth\r\nday, at the bidding of Croesus his servants led Solon round to see his\r\ntreasuries; and they showed him all things, how great and magnificent\r\nthey were: and after he had looked upon them all and examined them as he\r\nhad occasion, Croesus asked him as follows: \"Athenian guest, much report\r\nof thee has come to us, both in regard to thy wisdom and thy wanderings,\r\nhow that in thy search for wisdom thou hast traversed many lands to see\r\nthem; now therefore a desire has come upon me to ask thee whether thou\r\nhast seen any whom thou deemest to be of all men the most happy.\" 27\r\nThis he asked supposing that he himself was the happiest of men; but\r\nSolon, using no flattery but the truth only, said: \"Yes, O king, Tellos\r\nthe Athenian.\" And Croesus, marvelling at that which he said, asked\r\nhim earnestly: \"In what respect dost thou judge Tellos to be the most\r\nhappy?\" And he said: \"Tellos, in the first place, living while his\r\nnative State was prosperous, had sons fair and good and saw from all of\r\nthem children begotten and living to grow up; and secondly he had what\r\nwith us is accounted wealth, and after his life a most glorious end:\r\nfor when a battle was fought by the Athenians at Eleusis against the\r\nneighbouring people, he brought up supports and routed the foe and there\r\ndied by a most fair death; and the Athenians buried him publicly where\r\nhe fell, and honoured him greatly.\"\r\n\r\n31. So when Solon had moved Croesus to inquire further by the story of\r\nTellos, recounting how many points of happiness he had, the king\r\nasked again whom he had seen proper to be placed next after this man,\r\nsupposing that he himself would certainly obtain at least the second\r\nplace; but he replied: \"Cleobis and Biton: for these, who were of Argos\r\nby race, possessed a sufficiency of wealth and, in addition to this,\r\nstrength of body such as I shall tell. Both equally had won prizes in\r\nthe games, and moreover the following tale is told of them:—There was a\r\nfeast of Hera among the Argives and it was by all means necessary that\r\ntheir mother should be borne in a car to the temple. But since their\r\noxen were not brought up in time from the field, the young men, barred\r\nfrom all else by lack of time, submitted themselves to the yoke and drew\r\nthe wain, their mother being borne by them upon it; and so they brought\r\nit on for five-and-forty furlongs, 28 and came to the temple. Then after\r\nthey had done this and had been seen by the assembled crowd, there came\r\nto their life a most excellent ending; and in this the deity declared\r\nthat it was better for man to die than to continue to live. For the\r\nArgive men were standing round and extolling the strength 29 of the\r\nyoung men, while the Argive women were extolling the mother to whose\r\nlot it had fallen to have such sons; and the mother being exceedingly\r\nrejoiced both by the deed itself and by the report made of it, took her\r\nstand in front of the image of the goddess and prayed that she would\r\ngive to Cleobis and Biton her sons, who had honoured her 30 greatly,\r\nthat gift which is best for man to receive: and after this prayer, when\r\nthey had sacrificed and feasted, the young men lay down to sleep within\r\nthe temple itself, and never rose again, but were held bound in this\r\nlast end. 31 And the Argives made statues in the likeness of them and\r\ndedicated them as offerings at Delphi, thinking that they had proved\r\nthemselves most excellent.\"\r\n\r\n32. Thus Solon assigned the second place in respect of happiness to\r\nthese: and Croesus was moved to anger and said: \"Athenian guest, hast\r\nthou then so cast aside our prosperous state as worth nothing, that thou\r\ndost prefer to us even men of private station?\" And he said: \"Croesus,\r\nthou art inquiring about human fortunes of one who well knows that\r\nthe Deity is altogether envious and apt to disturb our lot. For in the\r\ncourse of long time a man may see many things which he would not desire\r\nto see, and suffer also many things which he would not desire to suffer.\r\nThe limit of life for a man I lay down at seventy years: and these\r\nseventy years give twenty-five thousand and two hundred days, not\r\nreckoning for any intercalated month. Then if every other one of these\r\nyears shall be made longer by one month, that the seasons may be caused\r\nto come round at the due time of the year, the intercalated months will\r\nbe in number five-and-thirty besides the seventy years; and of these\r\nmonths the days will be one thousand and fifty. Of all these days, being\r\nin number twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty, which go to the\r\nseventy years, one day produces nothing at all which resembles what\r\nanother brings with it. Thus then, O Croesus, man is altogether a\r\ncreature of accident. As for thee, I perceive that thou art both great\r\nin wealth and king of many men, but that of which thou didst ask me I\r\ncannot call thee yet, until I learn that thou hast brought thy life to\r\na fair ending: for the very rich man is not at all to be accounted more\r\nhappy than he who has but his subsistence from day to day, unless also\r\nthe fortune go with him of ending his life well in possession of all\r\nthings fair. For many very wealthy men are not happy, 32 while many who\r\nhave but a moderate living are fortunate; 33 and in truth the very rich\r\nman who is not happy has two advantages only as compared with the poor\r\nman who is fortunate, whereas this latter has many as compared with the\r\nrich man who is not happy. The rich man is able better to fulfil his\r\ndesire, and also to endure a great calamity if it fall upon him; whereas\r\nthe other has advantage over him in these things which follow:—he is not\r\nindeed able equally with the rich man to endure a calamity or to fulfil\r\nhis desire, but these his good fortune keeps away from him, while he is\r\nsound of limb, 34 free from disease, untouched by suffering, the father\r\nof fair children and himself of comely form; and if in addition to this\r\nhe shall end his life well, he is worthy to be called that which thou\r\nseekest, namely a happy man; but before he comes to his end it is well\r\nto hold back and not to call him yet happy but only fortunate. Now to\r\npossess all these things together is impossible for one who is mere man,\r\njust as no single land suffices to supply all things for itself, but one\r\nthing it has and another it lacks, and the land that has the greatest\r\nnumber of things is the best: so also in the case of a man, no single\r\nperson is complete in himself, for one thing he has and another he\r\nlacks; but whosoever of men continues to the end in possession of the\r\ngreatest number of these things and then has a gracious ending of his\r\nlife, he is by me accounted worthy, O king, to receive this name. But\r\nwe must of every thing examine the end and how it will turn out at the\r\nlast, for to many God shows but a glimpse of happiness and then plucks\r\nthem up by the roots and overturns them.\"\r\n\r\n33. Thus saying he refused to gratify Croesus, who sent him away\r\nfrom his presence holding him in no esteem, and thinking him utterly\r\nsenseless in that he passed over present good things and bade men look\r\nto the end of every matter.\r\n\r\n34. After Solon had departed, a great retribution from God came upon\r\nCroesus, probably because he judged himself to be the happiest of all\r\nmen. First there came and stood by him a dream, which showed to him the\r\ntruth of the evils that were about to come to pass in respect of his\r\nson. Now Croesus had two sons, of whom one was deficient, seeing that he\r\nwas deaf and dumb, while the other far surpassed his companions of the\r\nsame age in all things: and the name of this last was Atys. As regards\r\nthis Atys then, the dream signified to Croesus that he should lose him\r\nby the blow of an iron spear-point: 35 and when he rose up from sleep\r\nand considered the matter with himself, he was struck with fear on\r\naccount of the dream; and first he took for his son a wife; and whereas\r\nhis son had been wont to lead the armies of the Lydians, he now no\r\nlonger sent him forth anywhere on any such business; and the javelins\r\nand lances and all such things which men use for fighting he conveyed\r\nout of the men's apartments and piled them up in the inner bed-chambers,\r\nfor fear lest something hanging up might fall down upon his son.\r\n\r\n35. Then while he was engaged about the marriage of his son, there came\r\nto Sardis a man under a misfortune and with hands not clean, a Phrygian\r\nby birth and of the royal house. This man came to the house of Croesus,\r\nand according to the customs which prevail in that land made request\r\nthat he might have cleansing; and Croesus gave him cleansing: now the\r\nmanner of cleansing among the Lydians is the same almost as that which\r\nthe Hellenes use. So when Croesus had done that which was customary, he\r\nasked of him whence he came and who he was, saying as follows: \"Man, who\r\nart thou, and from what region of Phrygia didst thou come to sit upon\r\nmy hearth? And whom of men or women didst thou slay?\" And he replied:\r\n\"O king, I am the son of Gordias, the son of Midas, and I am called\r\nAdrastos; and I slew my own brother against my will, and therefore am I\r\nhere, having been driven forth by my father and deprived of all that I\r\nhad.\" And Croesus answered thus: \"Thou art, as it chances, the offshoot\r\nof men who are our friends and thou hast come to friends, among whom\r\nthou shalt want of nothing so long as thou shalt remain in our land: and\r\nthou wilt find it most for thy profit to bear this misfortune as lightly\r\nas may be.\" So he had his abode with Croesus. 36\r\n\r\n36. During this time there was produced in the Mysian Olympos a boar of\r\nmonstrous size. This, coming down from the mountain aforesaid, ravaged\r\nthe fields of the Mysians, and although the Mysians went out against it\r\noften, yet they could do it no hurt, but rather received hurt themselves\r\nfrom it; so at length messengers came from the Mysians to Croesus and\r\nsaid: \"O king, there has appeared in our land a boar of monstrous size,\r\nwhich lays waste our fields; and we, desiring eagerly to take it, are\r\nnot able: now therefore we ask of thee to send with us thy son and also\r\na chosen band of young men with dogs, that we may destroy it out of our\r\nland.\" Thus they made request, and Croesus calling to mind the words of\r\nthe dream spoke to them as follows: \"As touching my son, make no further\r\nmention of him in this matter; for I will not send him with you, seeing\r\nthat he is newly married and is concerned now with the affairs of his\r\nmarriage: but I will send with you chosen men of the Lydians and the\r\nwhole number of my hunting dogs, and I will give command to those who\r\ngo, to be as zealous as may be in helping you to destroy the wild beast\r\nout of your land.\"\r\n\r\n37. Thus he made reply, and while the Mysians were being contented with\r\nthis answer, there came in also the son of Croesus, having heard of the\r\nrequest made by the Mysians: and when Croesus said that he would not\r\nsend his son with them, the young man spoke as follows: \"My father, in\r\ntimes past the fairest and most noble part was allotted to us, to go out\r\ncontinually to wars and to the chase and so have good repute; but\r\nnow thou hast debarred me from both of these, although thou hast not\r\nobserved in me any cowardly or faint-hearted spirit. And now with what\r\nface must I appear when I go to and from the market-place of the city?\r\nWhat kind of a man shall I be esteemed by the citizens, and what kind of\r\na man shall I be esteemed by my newly-married wife? With what kind of a\r\nhusband will she think that she is mated? Therefore either let me go to\r\nthe hunt, or persuade me by reason that these things are better for me\r\ndone as now they are.\"\r\n\r\n38. And Croesus made answer thus: \"My son, not because I have observed\r\nin thee any spirit of cowardice or any other ungracious thing, do I act\r\nthus; but a vision of a dream came and stood by me in my sleep and told\r\nme that thou shouldest be short-lived, and that thou shouldest perish\r\nby a spear-point of iron. With thought of this vision therefore I both\r\nurged on this marriage for thee, and I refuse now to send thee upon the\r\nmatter which is being taken in hand, having a care of thee that I may\r\nsteal thee from thy fate at least for the period of my own life, if by\r\nany means possible for me to do so. For thou art, as it chances, my only\r\nson: the other I do not reckon as one, seeing that he is deficient in\r\nhearing.\"\r\n\r\n39. The young man made answer thus: \"It may well be forgiven in thee, O\r\nmy father, that thou shouldest have a care of me after having seen such\r\na vision; but that which thou dost not understand, and in which the\r\nmeaning of the dream has escaped thee, it is right that I should expound\r\nto thee. Thou sayest the dream declared that I should end my life by\r\nmeans of a spear-point of iron: but what hands has a boar, or what\r\nspear-point of iron, of which thou art afraid? If the dream had told\r\nthee that I should end my life by a tusk, or any other thing which\r\nresembles that, it would be right for thee doubtless to do as thou art\r\ndoing; but it said 'by a spear-point.' Since therefore our fight will\r\nnot be with men, let me now go.\"\r\n\r\n40. Croesus made answer: \"My son, thou dost partly prevail with me by\r\ndeclaring thy judgment about the dream; therefore, having been prevailed\r\nupon by thee, I change my resolution and allow thee to go to the chase.\"\r\n\r\n41. Having thus said Croesus went to summon Adrastos the Phrygian; and\r\nwhen he came, he addressed him thus: \"Adrastos, when thou wast struck\r\nwith a grievous misfortune (with which I reproach thee not), I cleansed\r\nthee, and I have received thee into my house supplying all thy costs.\r\nNow therefore, since having first received kindness from me thou art\r\nbound to requite me with kindness, I ask of thee to be the protector of\r\nmy son who goes forth to the chase, lest any evil robbers come upon\r\nyou by the way to do you harm; and besides this thou too oughtest to go\r\nwhere thou mayest become famous by thy deeds, for it belongs to thee\r\nas an inheritance from thy fathers so to do, and moreover thou hast\r\nstrength for it.\"\r\n\r\n42. Adrastos made answer: \"O king, but for this I should not have been\r\ngoing to any such contest of valour; for first it is not fitting that\r\none who is suffering such a great misfortune as mine should seek the\r\ncompany of his fellows who are in prosperity, and secondly I have no\r\ndesire for it; and for many reasons I should have kept myself away. But\r\nnow, since thou art urgent with me, and I ought to gratify thee (for I\r\nam bound to requite thee with kindness), I am ready to do this: expect\r\ntherefore that thy son, whom thou commandest me to protect, will home to\r\nthee unhurt, so far as his protector may avail to keep him safe.\"\r\n\r\n43. When he had made answer to Croesus in words like these, they\r\nafterwards set forth provided with chosen young men and with dogs.\r\nAnd when they were come to Mount Olympos, they tracked the animal;\r\nand having found it and taken their stand round in a circle, they\r\nwere hurling against it their spears. Then the guest, he who had been\r\ncleansed of manslaughter, whose name was Adrastos, hurling a spear at it\r\nmissed the boar and struck the son of Croesus. So he being struck by the\r\nspear-point fulfilled the saying of the dream. And one ran to report\r\nto Croesus that which had come to pass, and having come to Sardis he\r\nsignified to him of the combat and of the fate of his son. And Croesus\r\nwas very greatly disturbed by the death of his son, and was much the\r\nmore moved to complaining by this, namely that his son was slain by the\r\nman whom he had himself cleansed of manslaughter. And being grievously\r\ntroubled by the misfortune he called upon Zeus the Cleanser, protesting\r\nto him that which he had suffered from his guest, and he called moreover\r\nupon the Protector of Suppliants 37 and the Guardian of Friendship,\r\n38 naming still the same god, and calling upon him as the Protector of\r\nSuppliants because when he received the guest into his house he had\r\nbeen fostering ignorantly the slayer of his son, and as the Guardian of\r\nFriendship because having sent him as a protector he had found him the\r\nworst of foes.\r\n\r\n45. After this the Lydians came bearing the corpse, and behind it\r\nfollowed the slayer: and he taking his stand before the corpse delivered\r\nhimself up to Croesus, holding forth his hands and bidding the king slay\r\nhim over the corpse, speaking of his former misfortune and saying that\r\nin addition to this he had now been the destroyer of the man who had\r\ncleansed him of it; and that life for him was no more worth living. But\r\nCroesus hearing this pitied Adrastos, although he was himself suffering\r\nso great an evil of his own, and said to him: \"Guest, I have already\r\nreceived from thee all the satisfaction that is due, seeing that thou\r\ndost condemn thyself to suffer death; and not thou alone art the cause\r\nof this evil, except in so far as thou wert the instrument of it against\r\nthine own will, but some one, as I suppose, of the gods, who also long\r\nago signified to me that which was about to be.\" So Croesus buried his\r\nson as was fitting: but Adrastos the son of Gordias, the son of Midas,\r\nhe who had been the slayer of his own brother and the slayer also of the\r\nman who had cleansed him, when silence came of all men round about the\r\ntomb, recognising that he was more grievously burdened by misfortune\r\nthan all men of whom he knew, slew himself upon the grave.\r\n\r\n46. For two years then Croesus remained quiet in his mourning,\r\nbecause he was deprived of his son: but after this period of time the\r\noverthrowing of the rule of Astyages the son of Kyaxares by Cyrus\r\nthe son of Cambyses, and the growing greatness of the Persians caused\r\nCroesus to cease from his mourning, and led him to a care of cutting\r\nshort the power of the Persians, if by any means he might, while yet it\r\nwas in growth and before they should have become great.\r\n\r\nSo having formed this design he began forthwith to make trial of\r\nthe Oracles, both those of the Hellenes and that in Libya, sending\r\nmessengers some to one place and some to another, some to go to Delphi,\r\nothers to Abai of the Phokians, and others to Dodona; and some were\r\nsent to the shrine of Amphiaraos and to that of Trophonios, others to\r\nBranchidai in the land of Miletos: these are the Oracles of the Hellenes\r\nto which Croesus sent messengers to seek divination; and others he sent\r\nto the shrine of Ammon in Libya to inquire there. Now he was sending the\r\nmessengers abroad to the end that he might try the Oracles and find\r\nout what knowledge they had, so that if they should be found to have\r\nknowledge of the truth, he might send and ask them secondly whether he\r\nshould attempt to march against the Persians.\r\n\r\n47. And to the Lydians whom he sent to make trial of the Oracles he gave\r\ncharge as follows,—that from the day on which they set out from Sardis\r\nthey should reckon up the number of the days following and on the\r\nhundredth day they should consult the Oracles, asking what Croesus\r\nthe son of Alyattes king of the Lydians chanced then to be doing: and\r\nwhatever the Oracles severally should prophesy, this they should cause\r\nto be written down 39 and bear it back to him. Now what the other\r\nOracles prophesied is not by any reported, but at Delphi, so soon as the\r\nLydians entered the sanctuary of the temple 40 to consult the god and\r\nasked that which they were commanded to ask, the Pythian prophetess\r\nspoke thus in hexameter measure:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But the number of sand I know, 41 and the measure of drops in the ocean;\r\n  The dumb man I understand, and I hear the speech of the speechless:\r\n  And there hath come to my soul the smell of a strong-shelled tortoise\r\n  Boiling in caldron of bronze, and the flesh of a lamb mingled with it;\r\n  Under it bronze is laid, it hath bronze as a clothing upon it.\"\r\n\r\n48. When the Pythian prophetess had uttered this oracle, the Lydians\r\ncaused the prophecy to be written down, and went away at once to Sardis.\r\nAnd when the rest also who had been sent round were there arrived with\r\nthe answers of the Oracles, then Croesus unfolded the writings one by\r\none and looked upon them: and at first none of them pleased him, but\r\nwhen he heard that from Delphi, forthwith he did worship to the god and\r\naccepted the answer, 42 judging that the Oracle at Delphi was the only\r\ntrue one, because it had found out what he himself had done. For when he\r\nhad sent to the several Oracles his messengers to consult the gods,\r\nkeeping well in mind the appointed day he contrived the following\r\ndevice,—he thought of something which it would be impossible to discover\r\nor to conceive of, and cutting up a tortoise and a lamb he boiled them\r\ntogether himself in a caldron of bronze, laying a cover of bronze over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n49. This then was the answer given to Croesus from Delphi; and as\r\nregards the answer of Amphiaraos, I cannot tell what he replied to the\r\nLydians after they had done the things customary in his temple, 43 for\r\nthere is no record of this any more than of the others, except only that\r\nCroesus thought that he also 44 possessed a true Oracle.\r\n\r\n50. After this with great sacrifices he endeavoured to win the favour of\r\nthe god at Delphi: for of all the animals that are fit for sacrifice he\r\noffered three thousand of each kind, and he heaped up couches overlaid\r\nwith gold and overlaid with silver, and cups of gold, and robes of\r\npurple, and tunics, making of them a great pyre, and this he burnt up,\r\nhoping by these means the more to win over the god to the side of the\r\nLydians: and he proclaimed to all the Lydians that every one of them\r\nshould make sacrifice with that which each man had. And when he had\r\nfinished the sacrifice, he melted down a vast quantity of gold, and of\r\nit he wrought half-plinths 45 making them six palms 46 in length and\r\nthree in breadth, and in height one palm; and their number was one\r\nhundred and seventeen. Of these four were of pure gold 47 weighing two\r\ntalents and a half 48 each, and others of gold alloyed with silver 49\r\nweighing two talents. And he caused to be made also an image of a lion\r\nof pure gold weighing ten talents; which lion, when the temple of Delphi\r\nwas being burnt down, fell from off the half-plinths, for upon these\r\nit was set, 50 and is placed now in the treasury of the Corinthians,\r\nweighing six talents and a half, for three talents and a half were\r\nmelted away from it.\r\n\r\n51. So Croesus having finished all these things sent them to Delphi, and\r\nwith them these besides:—two mixing bowls of great size, one of gold and\r\nthe other of silver, of which the golden bowl was placed on the right\r\nhand as one enters the temple, and the silver on the left, but the\r\nplaces of these also were changed after the temple was burnt down,\r\nand the golden bowl is now placed in the treasury of the people of\r\nClazomenai, weighing eight and a half talents and twelve pounds over,\r\n51 while the silver one is placed in the corner of the vestibule 52 and\r\nholds six hundred amphors 53 (being filled with wine by the Delphians on\r\nthe feast of the Theophania): this the people of Delphi say is the work\r\nof Theodoros the Samian, 54 and, as I think, rightly, for it is evident\r\nto me that the workmanship is of no common kind: moreover Croesus sent\r\nfour silver wine-jars, which stand in the treasury of the Corinthians,\r\nand two vessels for lustral water, 55 one of gold and the other of\r\nsilver, of which the gold one is inscribed \"from the Lacedemonians,\"\r\nwho say that it is their offering: therein however they do not speak\r\nrightly; for this also is from Croesus, but one of the Delphians wrote\r\nthe inscription upon it, desiring to gratify the Lacedemonians; and his\r\nname I know but will not make mention of it. The boy through whose hand\r\nthe water flows is from the Lacedemonians, but neither of the vessels\r\nfor lustral water. And many other votive offerings Croesus sent with\r\nthese, not specially distinguished, among which are certain castings 56\r\nof silver of a round shape, and also a golden figure of a woman three\r\ncubits high, which the Delphians say is a statue of the baker of\r\nCroesus. Moreover Croesus dedicated the ornaments from his wife's neck\r\nand her girdles.\r\n\r\n52. These are the things which he sent to Delphi; and to Amphiaraos,\r\nhaving heard of his valour and of his evil fate, he dedicated a shield\r\nmade altogether of gold throughout, and a spear all of solid gold, the\r\nshaft being of gold also as well as the two points, which offerings\r\nwere both remaining even to my time at Thebes in the temple of Ismenian\r\nApollo.\r\n\r\n53. To the Lydians who were to carry these gifts to the temples Croesus\r\ngave charge that they should ask the Oracles this question also,—whether\r\nCroesus should march against the Persians, and if so, whether he should\r\njoin with himself any army of men as his friends. And when the Lydians\r\nhad arrived at the places to which they had been sent and had dedicated\r\nthe votive offerings, they inquired of the Oracles and said: \"Croesus,\r\nking of the Lydians and of other nations, considering that these are\r\nthe only true Oracles among men, presents to you 57 gifts such as your\r\nrevelations deserve, and asks you again now whether he shall march\r\nagainst the Persians, and if so, whether he shall join with himself any\r\narmy of men as allies.\" They inquired thus, and the answers of both\r\nthe Oracles agreed in one, declaring to Croesus that if he should\r\nmarch against the Persians he should destroy a great empire: and they\r\ncounselled him to find out the most powerful of the Hellenes and join\r\nthese with himself as friends.\r\n\r\n54. So when the answers were brought back and Croesus heard them, he\r\nwas delighted with the oracles, and expecting that he would certainly\r\ndestroy the kingdom of Cyrus, he sent again to Pytho, 58 and presented\r\nto the men of Delphi, having ascertained the number of them, two staters\r\nof gold for each man: and in for this the Delphians gave to Croesus and\r\nto the Lydians precedence in consulting the Oracle and freedom from all\r\npayments, and the right to front seats at the games, with this privilege\r\nalso for all time, that any one of them who wished should be allowed to\r\nbecome a citizen of Delphi.\r\n\r\n55. And having made presents to the men of Delphi, Croesus consulted the\r\nOracle the third time; for from the time when he learnt the truth of\r\nthe Oracle, he made abundant use of it. 59 And consulting the Oracle\r\nhe inquired whether his monarchy would endure for a long time. And the\r\nPythian prophetess answered him thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But when it cometh to pass that a mule of the Medes shall be monarch\r\n  Then by the pebbly Hermos, O Lydian delicate-footed,\r\n  Flee and stay not, and be not ashamed to be callèd a coward.\"\r\n\r\n56. By these lines when they came to him Croesus was pleased more than\r\nby all the rest, for he supposed that a mule would never be ruler of the\r\nMedes instead of a man, and accordingly that he himself and his heirs\r\nwould never cease from their rule. Then after this he gave thought to\r\ninquire which people of the Hellenes he should esteem the most powerful\r\nand gain over to himself as friends. And inquiring he found that the\r\nLacedemonians and the Athenians had the pre-eminence, the first of the\r\nDorian and the others of the Ionian race. For these were the most\r\neminent races in ancient time, the second being a Pelasgian and the\r\nfirst a Hellenic race: and the one never migrated from its place in any\r\ndirection, while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings; for\r\nin the reign of Deucalion this race dwelt in Pthiotis, and in the time\r\nof Doros the son of Hellen in the land lying below Ossa and Olympos,\r\nwhich is called Histiaiotis; and when it was driven from Histiaiotis by\r\nthe sons of Cadmos, it dwelt in Pindos and was called Makednian; and\r\nthence it moved afterwards to Dryopis, and from Dryopis it came finally\r\nto Peloponnesus, and began to be called Dorian.\r\n\r\n57. What language however the Pelasgians used to speak I am not able\r\nwith certainty to say. But if one must pronounce judging by those that\r\nstill remain of the Pelasgians who dwelt in the city of Creston 60 above\r\nthe Tyrsenians, and who were once neighbours of the race now called\r\nDorian, dwelling then in the land which is now called Thessaliotis, and\r\nalso by those that remain of the Pelasgians who settled at Plakia\r\nand Skylake in the region of the Hellespont, who before that had been\r\nsettlers with the Athenians, 61 and of the natives of the various other\r\ntowns which are really Pelasgian, though they have lost the name,—if\r\none must pronounce judging by these, the Pelasgians used to speak a\r\nBarbarian language. If therefore all the Pelasgian race was such as\r\nthese, then the Attic race, being Pelasgian, at the same time when it\r\nchanged and became Hellenic, unlearnt also its language. For the people\r\nof Creston do not speak the same language with any of those who dwell\r\nabout them, nor yet do the people of Phakia, but they speak the same\r\nlanguage one as the other: and by this it is proved that they still keep\r\nunchanged the form of language which they brought with them when they\r\nmigrated to these places.\r\n\r\n58. As for the Hellenic race, it has used ever the same language, as I\r\nclearly perceive, since it first took its rise; but since the time when\r\nit parted off feeble at first from the Pelasgian race, setting forth\r\nfrom a small beginning it has increased to that great number of races\r\nwhich we see, 62 and chiefly because many Barbarian races have been\r\nadded to it besides. Moreover it is true, as I think, 6201 of the\r\nPelasgian race also, 63 that so far as it remained Barbarian it never\r\nmade any great increase.\r\n\r\n59. Of these races then Croesus was informed that the Athenian was held\r\nsubject and torn with faction by Peisistratos 64 the son of Hippocrates,\r\nwho then was despot of the Athenians. For to Hippocrates, when as a\r\nprivate citizen he went to view the Olympic games, a great marvel had\r\noccurred. After he had offered the sacrifice, the caldrons which were\r\nstanding upon the hearth, full of pieces of flesh and of water, boiled\r\nwithout fire under them and ran over. And Chilon the Lacedemonian,\r\nwho chanced to have been present and to have seen the marvel, advised\r\nHippocrates first not to bring into his house a wife to bear him\r\nchildren, and secondly, if he happened to have one already, to dismiss\r\nher, and if he chanced to have a son, to disown him. When Chilon\r\nhad thus recommended, Hippocrates, they say, was not willing to be\r\npersuaded, and so there was born to him afterwards this Peisistratos;\r\nwho, when the Athenians of the shore 65 were at feud with those of the\r\nplain, Megacles the son of Alcmaion being leader of the first faction,\r\nand Lycurgos the son of Aristolaïdes of that of the plain, aimed at the\r\ndespotism for himself and gathered a third party. So then, after\r\nhaving collected supporters and called himself leader of the men of the\r\nmountain-lands, 66 he contrived a device as follows:—he inflicted\r\nwounds upon himself and upon his mules, and then drove his car into the\r\nmarket-place, as if he had just escaped from his opponents, who, as he\r\nalleged, had desired to kill him when he was driving into the country:\r\nand he asked the commons that he might obtain some protection from them,\r\nfor before this he had gained reputation in his command against the\r\nMegarians, during which he took Nisaia and performed other signal\r\nservice. And the commons of the Athenians being deceived gave him those\r\n67 men chosen from the dwellers in the city who became not indeed the\r\nspear-men 68 of Peisistratos but his club-men; for they followed behind\r\nhim bearing wooden clubs. And these made insurrection with Peisistratos\r\nand obtained possession of the Acropolis. Then Peisistratos was ruler of\r\nthe Athenians, not having disturbed the existing magistrates nor changed\r\nthe ancient laws; but he administered the State under that constitution\r\nof things which was already established, ordering it fairly and well.\r\n\r\n60. However, no long time after this the followers of Megacles and those\r\nof Lycurgos joined together and drove him forth. Thus Peisistratos had\r\nobtained possession of Athens for the first time, and thus he lost\r\nthe power before he had it firmly rooted. But those who had driven\r\nout Peisistratos became afterwards at feud with one another again.\r\nAnd Megacles, harassed by the party strife, 69 sent a message to\r\nPeisistratos asking whether he was willing to have his daughter to wife\r\non condition of becoming despot. And Peisistratos having accepted the\r\nproposal and made an agreement on these terms, they contrived with a\r\nview to his a device the most simple by far, as I think, that ever was\r\npractised, considering at least that it was devised at a time when\r\nthe Hellenic race had been long marked off from the Barbarian as more\r\nskilful and further removed from foolish simplicity, and among the\r\nAthenians who are accounted the first of the Hellenes in ability. 70\r\nIn the deme of Paiania there was a woman whose name was Phya, in height\r\nfour cubits all but three fingers, 71 and also fair of form. This woman\r\nthey dressed in full armour and caused her to ascend a chariot and\r\nshowed her the bearing in which she might best beseem her part, 72 and\r\nso they drove to the city, having sent on heralds to run before them,\r\nwho, when they arrived at the city, spoke that which had been commanded\r\nthem, saying as follows: \"O Athenians, receive with favour Peisistratos,\r\nwhom Athene herself, honouring him most of all men, brings back to her\r\nAcropolis.\" So the heralds went about hither and thither saying this,\r\nand straightway there came to the demes in the country round a report\r\nthat Athene was bringing Peisistratos back, while at the same time the\r\nmen of the city, persuaded that the woman was the very goddess herself,\r\nwere paying worship to the human creature and receiving Peisistratos.\r\n\r\n61. So having received back the despotism in the manner which has been\r\nsaid, Peisistratos according to the agreement made with Megacles married\r\nthe daughter of Megacles; but as he had already sons who were young men,\r\nand as the descendants of Alcmaion were said to be under a curse, 73\r\ntherefore not desiring that children should be born to him from his\r\nnewly-married wife, he had commerce with her not in the accustomed\r\nmanner. And at first the woman kept this secret, but afterwards she told\r\nher mother, whether in answer to her inquiry or not I cannot tell; and\r\nthe mother told her husband Megacles. He then was very indignant that he\r\nshould be dishonoured by Peisistratos; and in his anger straightway he\r\nproceeded to compose his quarrel with the men of his faction. And when\r\nPeisistratos heard of that which was being done against himself, he\r\ndeparted wholly from the land and came to Eretria, where he took counsel\r\ntogether with his sons: and the advice of Hippias having prevailed, that\r\nthey should endeavour to win back the despotism, they began to gather\r\ngifts of money from those States which owed them obligations for favours\r\nreceived: and many contributed great sums, but the Thebans surpassed\r\nthe rest in the giving of money. Then, not to make the story long, time\r\nelapsed and at last everything was prepared for their . For certain\r\nArgives came as mercenaries from the Peloponnesus, and a man of Naxos\r\nhad come to them of his own motion, whose name was Lygdamis, and showed\r\nvery great zeal in providing both money and men.\r\n\r\n62. So starting from Eretria after the lapse of ten years 74 they ed\r\nback; and in Attica the first place of which they took possession was\r\nMarathon. While they were encamping here, their partisans from the city\r\ncame to them, and also others flowed in from the various demes, to whom\r\ndespotic rule was more welcome than freedom. So these were gathering\r\nthemselves together; but the Athenians in the city, so long as\r\nPeisistratos was collecting the money, and afterwards when he took\r\npossession of Marathon, made no account of it; but when they heard that\r\nhe was marching from Marathon towards the city, then they went to the\r\nrescue against him. These then were going in full force to fight against\r\nthe ing exiles, and the forces of Peisistratos, as they went towards the\r\ncity starting from Marathon, met them just when they came to the temple\r\nof Athene Pallenis, and there encamped opposite to them. Then moved\r\nby divine guidance 75 there came into the presence of Peisistratos\r\nAmphilytos the Arcarnanian, 76 a soothsayer, who approaching him uttered\r\nan oracle in hexameter verse, saying thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But now the cast hath been made and the net hath been widely extended,\r\n  And in the night the tunnies will dart through the moon-lighted waters.\"\r\n\r\n63. This oracle he uttered to him being divinely inspired, and\r\nPeisistratos, having understood the oracle and having said that he\r\naccepted the prophecy which was uttered, led his army against the enemy.\r\nNow the Athenians from the city were just at that time occupied with the\r\nmorning meal, and some of them after their meal with games of dice or\r\nwith sleep; and the forces of Peisistratos fell upon the Athenians and\r\nput them to flight. Then as they fled, Peisistratos devised a very\r\nskilful counsel, to the end that the Athenians might not gather again\r\ninto one body but might remain scattered abroad. He mounted his sons on\r\nhorseback and sent them before him; and overtaking the fugitives they\r\nsaid that which was commanded them by Peisistratos, bidding them be of\r\ngood cheer and that each man should depart to his own home.\r\n\r\n64. Thus then the Athenians did, and so Peisistratos for the third time\r\nobtained possession of Athens, and he firmly rooted his despotism by\r\nmany foreign mercenaries and by much revenue of money, coming partly\r\nfrom the land itself and partly from about the river Strymon, and also\r\nby taking as hostages the sons of those Athenians who had remained in\r\nthe land and had not at once fled, and placing them in the hands of\r\nNaxos; for this also Peisistratos conquered by war and delivered into\r\nthe charge of Lygdamis. Moreover besides this he cleansed the island\r\nof Delos in obedience to the oracles; and his cleansing was of the\r\nfollowing kind:—so far as the view from the temple extended 77 he dug up\r\nall the dead bodies which were buried in this part and removed them to\r\nanother part of Delos. So Peisistratos was despot of the Athenians; but\r\nof the Athenians some had fallen in the battle, and others of them with\r\nthe sons of Alcmaion were exiles from their native land.\r\n\r\n65. Such was the condition of things which Croesus heard was prevailing\r\namong the Athenians during this time; but as to the Lacedemonians he\r\nheard that they had escaped from great evils and had now got the better\r\nof the Tegeans in the war. For when Leon and Hegesicles were kings of\r\nSparta, the Lacedemonians, who had good success in all their other wars,\r\nsuffered disaster in that alone which they waged against the men of\r\nTegea. Moreover in the times before this they had the worst laws of\r\nalmost all the Hellenes, both in matters which concerned themselves\r\nalone and also in that they had no dealings with strangers. And they\r\nmade their change to a good constitution of laws thus:—Lycurgos, a\r\nman of the Spartans who was held in high repute, came to the Oracle at\r\nDelphi, and as he entered the sanctuary of the temple, straightway the\r\nPythian prophetess said as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Lo, thou art come, O Lycurgos, to this rich shrine of my temple,\r\n  Loved thou by Zeus and by all who possess the abodes of Olympos.\r\n  Whether to call thee a god, I doubt, in my voices prophetic,\r\n  God or a man, but rather a god I think, O Lycurgos.\"\r\n\r\n66. Some say in addition to this that the Pythian prophetess also set\r\nforth to him the order of things which is now established for the\r\nSpartans; but the Lacedemonians themselves say that Lycurgos having\r\nbecome guardian of Leobotes his brother's son, who was king of the\r\nSpartans, brought in these things from Crete. For as soon as he became\r\nguardian, he changed all the prevailing laws, and took measures that\r\nthey should not transgress his institutions: and after this Lycurgos\r\nestablished that which appertained to war, namely Enomoties and Triecads\r\nand Common Meals, 7701 and in addition to this the Ephors and the\r\nSenate. Having changed thus, the Spartans had good laws; and to Lycurgos\r\nafter he was dead they erected a temple, and they pay him great worship.\r\nSo then, as might be supposed, with a fertile land and with no small\r\nnumber of men dwelling in it, they straightway shot up and became\r\nprosperous: and it was no longer sufficient for them to keep still; but\r\npresuming that they were superior in strength to the Arcadians, they\r\nconsulted the Oracle at Delphi respecting conquest of the whole of\r\nArcadia; and the Pythian prophetess gave answer thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"The land of Arcadia thou askest; thou askest me much; I refuse it;\r\n  Many there are in Arcadian land, stout men, eating acorns;\r\n  These will prevent thee from this: but I am not grudging towards thee;\r\n  Tegea beaten with sounding feet I will give thee to dance in,\r\n  And a fair plain I will give thee to measure with line and divide it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Lacedemonians heard report of this, they held off from the\r\nother Arcadians, and marched against the Tegeans with fetters in their\r\nhands, trusting to a deceitful 78 oracle and expecting that they\r\nwould make slaves of the men of Tegea. But having been worsted in the\r\nencounter, those of them who were taken alive worked wearing the fetters\r\nwhich they themselves brought with them and having \"measured with line\r\nand divided\" 79 the plain of the Tegeans. And these fetters with which\r\nthey had been bound were preserved even to my own time at Tegea, hanging\r\nabout the temple of Athene Alea. 80\r\n\r\n67. In the former war then I say they struggled against the Tegeans\r\ncontinually with ill success; but in the time of Croesus and in the\r\nreign of Anaxandrides and Ariston at Lacedemon the Spartans had at\r\nlength become victors in the war; and they became so in the following\r\nmanner:—As they continued to be always worsted in the war by the men of\r\nTegea, they sent messengers to consult the Oracle at Delphi and inquired\r\nwhat god they should propitiate in order to get the better of the men\r\nof Tegea in the war: and the Pythian prophetess made answer to them\r\nthat they should bring into their land the bones of Orestes the son of\r\nAgamemnon. Then as they were not able to find the grave of Orestes,\r\nthey sent men again to go to the god and to inquire about the spot where\r\nOrestes was laid: and when the messengers who were sent asked this, the\r\nprophetess said as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Tegea there is, in Arcadian land, in a smooth place founded;\r\n  Where there do blow two blasts by strong compulsion together;\r\n  Stroke too there is and stroke in , and trouble on trouble.\r\n  There Agamemnon's son in the life-giving earth is reposing;\r\n  Him if thou bring with thee home, of Tegea thou shalt be master.\" 81\r\n\r\nWhen the Lacedemonians had heard this they were none the less far from\r\nfinding it out, though they searched all places; until the time that\r\nLichas, one of those Spartans who are called \"Well-doers,\" 82 discovered\r\nit. Now the \"Well-doers\" are of the citizens the eldest who are passing\r\nfrom the ranks of the \"Horsemen,\" in each year five; and these are bound\r\nduring that year in which they pass out from the \"Horsemen,\" to allow\r\nthemselves to be sent without ceasing to various places by the Spartan\r\nState.\r\n\r\n68. Lichas then, being one of these, discovered it in Tegea by means\r\nboth of fortune and ability. For as there were at that time dealings\r\nunder truce with the men of Tegea, he had come to a forge there and was\r\nlooking at iron being wrought; and he was in wonder as he saw that which\r\nwas being done. The smith therefore, perceiving that he marvelled at it,\r\nceased from his work and said: \"Surely, thou stranger of Lacedemon, if\r\nthou hadst seen that which I once saw, thou wouldst have marvelled much,\r\nsince now it falls out that thou dost marvel so greatly at the working\r\nof this iron; for I, desiring in this enclosure to make a well, lighted\r\nin my digging upon a coffin of seven cubits in length; and not believing\r\nthat ever there had been men larger than those of the present day,\r\nI opened it, and I saw that the dead body was equal in length to the\r\ncoffin: then after I had measured it, I filled in the earth over it\r\nagain.\" He then thus told him of that which he had seen; and the other,\r\nhaving thought upon that which was told, conjectured that this was\r\nOrestes according to the saying of the Oracle, forming his conjecture\r\nin the following manner:—whereas he saw that the smith had two pairs of\r\nbellows, he concluded that these were the winds spoken of, and that the\r\nanvil and the hammer were the stroke and the stroke in , and that the\r\niron which was being wrought was the trouble laid upon trouble, making\r\ncomparison by the thought that iron has been discovered for the evil of\r\nmankind. Having thus conjectured he came back to Sparta and declared the\r\nwhole matter to the Lacedemonians; and they brought a charge against him\r\non a fictitious pretext and drove him out into exile. 83 So having come\r\nto Tegea, he told the smith of his evil fortune and endeavoured to hire\r\nfrom him the enclosure, but at first he would not allow him to have it:\r\nat length however Lichas persuaded him and he took up his abode there;\r\nand he dug up the grave and gathered together the bones and went with\r\nthem away to Sparta. From that time, whenever they made trial of one\r\nanother, the Lacedemonians had much the advantage in the war; and by now\r\nthey had subdued to themselves the greater part of Peloponnesus besides.\r\n\r\n69. Croesus accordingly being informed of all these things was sending\r\nmessengers to Sparta with gifts in their hands to ask for an alliance,\r\nhaving commanded them what they ought to say: and they when they came\r\nsaid: \"Croesus king of the Lydians and also of other nations sent us\r\nhither and saith as follows: O Lacedemonians, whereas the god by an\r\noracle bade me join with myself the Hellene as a friend, therefore,\r\nsince I am informed that ye are the chiefs of Hellas, I invite you\r\naccording to the oracle, desiring to be your friend and your ally\r\napart from all guile and deceit.\" Thus did Croesus announce to the\r\nLacedemonians through his messengers; and the Lacedemonians, who\r\nthemselves also had heard of the oracle given to Croesus, were pleased\r\nat the coming of the Lydians and exchanged oaths of friendship and\r\nalliance: for they were bound to Croesus also by some services rendered\r\nto them even before this time; since the Lacedemonians had sent to\r\nSardis and were buying gold there with purpose of using it for the image\r\nof Apollo which is now set up on Mount Thornax in the Lacedemonian land;\r\nand Croesus, when they desired to buy it, gave it them as a gift.\r\n\r\n70. For this reason therefore the Lacedemonians accepted the alliance,\r\nand also because he chose them as his friends, preferring them to all\r\nthe other Hellenes. And not only were they ready themselves when he made\r\nhis offer, but they caused a mixing-bowl to be made of bronze, covered\r\noutside with figures round the rim and of such a size as to hold three\r\nhundred amphors, 84 and this they conveyed, desiring to give it as a\r\ngift in to Croesus. This bowl never came to Sardis for reasons of which\r\ntwo accounts are given as follows:—The Lacedemonians say that when the\r\nbowl was on its way to Sardis and came opposite the land of Samos, the\r\nmen of Samos having heard of it sailed out with ships of war and took\r\nit away; but the Samians themselves say that the Lacedemonians who were\r\nconveying the bowl, finding that they were too late and hearing that\r\nSardis had been taken and Croesus was a prisoner, sold the bowl in\r\nSamos, and certain private persons bought it and dedicated it as a\r\nvotive offering in the temple of Hera; and probably those who had sold\r\nit would say when they ed to Sparta that it had been taken from them by\r\nthe Samians.\r\n\r\n71. Thus then it happened about the mixing-bowl: but meanwhile Croesus,\r\nmistaking the meaning of the oracle, was making a march into Cappadokia,\r\nexpecting to overthrow Cyrus and the power of the Persians: and while\r\nCroesus was preparing to march against the Persians, one of the\r\nLydians, who even before this time was thought to be a wise man but in\r\nconsequence of this opinion got a very great name for wisdom among\r\nthe Lydians, had advised Croesus as follows (the name of the man was\r\nSandanis):—\"O king, thou art preparing to march against men who wear\r\nbreeches of leather, and the rest of their clothing is of leather also;\r\nand they eat food not such as they desire but such as they can obtain,\r\ndwelling in a land which is rugged; and moreover they make no use of\r\nwine but drink water; and no figs have they for dessert, nor any other\r\ngood thing. On the one hand, if thou shalt overcome them, what wilt thou\r\ntake away from them, seeing they have nothing? and on the other hand,\r\nif thou shalt be overcome, consider how many good things thou wilt lose;\r\nfor once having tasted our good things, they will cling to them fast\r\nand it will not be possible to drive them away. I for my own part feel\r\ngratitude to the gods that they do not put it into the minds of the\r\nPersians to march against the Lydians.\" Thus he spoke not persuading\r\nCroesus: for it is true indeed that the Persians before they subdued the\r\nLydians had no luxury nor any good thing.\r\n\r\n72. Now the Cappadokians are called by the Hellenes Syrians; 85 and\r\nthese Syrians, before the Persians had rule, were subjects of the Medes,\r\nbut at this time they were subjects of Cyrus. For the boundary between\r\nthe Median empire and the Lydian was the river Halys; and this flows\r\nfrom the mountain-land of Armenia through the Kilikians, and afterwards,\r\nas it flows, it has the Matienians on the right hand and the Phrygians\r\non the other side; then passing by these and flowing up towards the\r\nNorth Wind, it bounds on the one side the Cappadokian Syrians and on the\r\nleft hand the Paphlagonians. Thus the river Halys cuts off from the rest\r\nalmost all the lower parts of Asia by a line extending from the sea\r\nthat is opposite Cyprus to the Euxine. And this tract is the neck of the\r\nwhole peninsula, the distance of the journey being such that five days\r\nare spent on the way by a man without encumbrance. 86\r\n\r\n73. Now for the following reasons Croesus was marching into\r\nCappadokia:—first because he desired to acquire the land in addition to\r\nhis own possessions, and then especially because he had confidence in\r\nthe oracle and wished to take vengeance on Cyrus for Astyages. For\r\nCyrus the son of Cambyses had conquered Astyages and was keeping him in\r\ncaptivity, who was brother by marriage to Croesus and king of the Medes:\r\nand he had become the brother by marriage of Croesus in this manner:—A\r\nhorde of the nomad Scythians at feud with the rest withdrew and sought\r\nrefuge in the land of the Medes: and at this time the ruler of the Medes\r\nwas Kyaxares the son of Phraortes, the son of Deïokes, who at first\r\ndealt well with these Scythians, being suppliants for his protection;\r\nand esteeming them very highly he delivered boys to them to learn their\r\nspeech and the art of shooting with the bow. Then time went by, and the\r\nScythians used to go out continually to the chase and always brought\r\nback something; till once it happened that they took nothing, and when\r\nthey ed with empty hands Kyaxares (being, as he showed on this occasion,\r\nnot of an eminently good disposition 87) dealt with them very harshly\r\nand used insult towards them. And they, when they had received this\r\ntreatment from Kyaxares, considering that they had suffered indignity,\r\nplanned to kill and to cut up one of the boys who were being instructed\r\namong them, and having dressed his flesh as they had been wont to dress\r\nthe wild animals, to bear it to Kyaxares and give it to him, pretending\r\nthat it was game taken in hunting; and when they had given it, their\r\ndesign was to make their way as quickly as possible to Alyattes the son\r\nof Sadyattes at Sardis. This then was done; and Kyaxares with the guests\r\nwho ate at his table tasted of that meat, and the Scythians having so\r\ndone became suppliants for the protection of Alyattes.\r\n\r\n74. After this, seeing that Alyattes would not give up the Scythians\r\nwhen Kyaxares demanded them, there had arisen war between the Lydians\r\nand the Medes lasting five years; in which years the Medes often\r\ndiscomfited the Lydians and the Lydians often discomfited the Medes (and\r\namong others they fought also a battle by night): 88 and as they still\r\ncarried on the war with equally balanced fortune, in the sixth year a\r\nbattle took place in which it happened, when the fight had begun, that\r\nsuddenly the day became night. And this change of the day Thales the\r\nMilesian had foretold to the Ionians laying down as a limit this very\r\nyear in which the change took place. The Lydians however and the Medes,\r\nwhen they saw that it had become night instead of day, ceased from their\r\nfighting and were much more eager both of them that peace should be made\r\nbetween them. And they who brought about the peace between them were\r\nSyennesis the Kilikian and Labynetos the Babylonian: 89 these were they\r\nwho urged also the taking of the oath by them, and they brought about an\r\ninterchange of marriages; for they decided that Alyattes should give his\r\ndaughter Aryenis to Astyages the son of Kyaxares, seeing that without\r\nthe compulsion of a strong tie agreements are apt not to hold strongly\r\ntogether. Now these nations observe the same ceremonies in taking oaths\r\nas the Hellenes, and in addition to them they make incision into the\r\nskin of their arms, and then lick up the blood each of the other.\r\n\r\n75. This Astyages then, being his mother's father, Cyrus had conquered\r\nand made prisoner for a reason which I shall declare in the history\r\nwhich comes after. 90 This then was the complaint which Croesus had\r\nagainst Cyrus when he sent to the Oracles to ask if he should march\r\nagainst the Persians; and when a deceitful answer had come back to him,\r\nhe marched into the dominion of the Persians, supposing that the answer\r\nwas favourable to himself. And when Croesus came to the river Halys,\r\nthen, according to my account, he passed his army across by the bridges\r\nwhich there were; but, according to the account which prevails among the\r\nHellenes, Thales the Milesian enabled him to pass his army across. For,\r\nsay they, when Croesus was at a loss how his army should pass over the\r\nriver (since, they add, there were not yet at that time the bridges\r\nwhich now there are), Thales being present in the army caused the river,\r\nwhich flowed then on the left hand of the army, to flow partly also on\r\nthe right; and he did it thus:—beginning above the camp he proceeded to\r\ndig a deep channel, directing it in the form of a crescent moon, so that\r\nthe river might take the camp there pitched in the rear, being turned\r\naside from its ancient course by this way along the channel, and\r\nafterwards passing by the camp might fall again into its ancient course;\r\nso that as soon as the river was thus parted in two it became fordable\r\nby both branches: and some say even that the ancient course of the river\r\nwas altogether dried up. But this tale I do not admit as true, for how\r\nthen did they pass over the river as they went back?\r\n\r\n76. And Croesus, when he had passed over with his army, came to that\r\nplace in Cappadokia which is called Pteria (now Pteria is the strongest\r\nplace in this country, and is situated somewhere about in a line with\r\nthe city of Sinope 91 on the Euxine). Here he encamped and ravaged the\r\nfields of the Syrians. Moreover he took the city of the Pterians, and\r\nsold the people into slavery, and he took also all the towns that lay\r\nabout it; and the Syrians, who were not guilty of any wrong, he forced\r\nto remove from their homes. 92 Meanwhile Cyrus, having gathered his\r\nown forces and having taken up in addition to them all who dwelt in the\r\nregion between, was coming to meet Croesus. Before he began however to\r\nlead forth his army, he had sent heralds to the Ionians and tried to\r\ninduce them to revolt from Croesus; but the Ionians would not do as he\r\nsaid. Then when Cyrus was come and had encamped over against Croesus,\r\nthey made trial of one another by force of arms in the land of Pteria:\r\nand after hard fighting, when many had fallen on both sides, at length,\r\nnight having come on, they parted from one the other with no victory on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\n77. Thus the two armies contended with one another: and Croesus being\r\nill satisfied with his own army in respect of number (for the army\r\nwhich he had when he fought was far smaller than that of Cyrus), being\r\ndissatisfied with it I say on this account, as Cyrus did not attempt to\r\nadvance against him on the following day, marched back to Sardis, having\r\nit in his mind to call the Egyptians to his help according to the oath\r\nwhich they had taken (for he had made an alliance with Amasis king of\r\nEgypt before he made the alliance with the Lacedemonians), and to\r\nsummon the Babylonians as well (for with these also an alliance had\r\nbeen concluded by him, Labynetos 93 being at that time ruler of the\r\nBabylonians), and moreover to send a message to the Lacedemonians\r\nbidding them appear at a fixed time: and then after he had got all these\r\ntogether and had gathered his own army, his design was to let the winter\r\ngo by and at the coming of spring to march against the Persians. So with\r\nthese thoughts in his mind, as soon as he came to Sardis he proceeded to\r\nsend heralds to his several allies to give them notice that by the fifth\r\nmonth from that time they should assemble at Sardis: but the army which\r\nhe had with him and which had fought with the Persians, an army which\r\nconsisted of mercenary troops, 94 he let go and disbanded altogether,\r\nnever expecting that Cyrus, after having contended against him with such\r\neven fortune, would after all march upon Sardis.\r\n\r\n78. When Croesus had these plans in his mind, the suburb of the city\r\nbecame of a sudden all full of serpents; and when these had appeared,\r\nthe horses leaving off to feed in their pastures came constantly thither\r\nand devoured them. When Croesus saw this he deemed it to be a portent,\r\nas indeed it was: and forthwith he despatched messengers to the dwelling\r\nof the Telmessians, who interpret omens: and the messengers who were\r\nsent to consult arrived there and learnt from the Telmessians what the\r\nportent meant to signify, but they did not succeed in reporting the\r\nanswer to Croesus, for before they sailed back to Sardis Croesus had\r\nbeen taken prisoner. The Telmessians however gave decision thus: that an\r\narmy speaking a foreign tongue was to be looked for by Croesus to\r\ninvade his land, and that this when it came would subdue the native\r\ninhabitants; for they said that the serpent was born of the soil, while\r\nthe horse was an enemy and a stranger. The men of Telmessos thus made\r\nanswer to Croesus after he was already taken prisoner, not knowing as\r\nyet anything of the things which had happened to Sardis and to Croesus\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n79. Cyrus, however, so soon as Croesus marched away after the battle\r\nwhich had been fought in Pteria, having learnt that Croesus meant after\r\nhe had marched away to disband his army, took counsel with himself and\r\nconcluded that it was good for him to march as quickly as possible\r\nto Sardis, before the power of the Lydians should be again gathered\r\ntogether. So when he had resolved upon this, he did it without delay:\r\nfor he marched his army into Lydia with such speed that he was himself\r\nthe first to announce his coming to Croesus. Then Croesus, although he\r\nhad come to a great strait, since his affairs had fallen out altogether\r\ncontrary to his own expectation, yet proceeded to lead forth the\r\nLydians into battle. Now there was at this time no nation in Asia more\r\ncourageous or more stout in battle than the Lydian; and they fought on\r\nhorseback carrying long spears, the men being excellent in horsemanship.\r\n\r\n80. So when the armies had met in that plain which is in front of the\r\ncity of Sardis,—a plain wide and open, through which flow rivers (and\r\nespecially the river Hyllos) all rushing down to join the largest called\r\nHermos, which flows from the mountain sacred to the Mother surnamed\r\n\"of Dindymos\" 95 and runs out into the sea by the city of Phocaia,—then\r\nCyrus, when he saw the Lydians being arrayed for battle, fearing their\r\nhorsemen, did on the suggestion of Harpagos a Mede as follows:—all\r\nthe camels which were in the train of his army carrying provisions and\r\nbaggage he gathered together, and he took off their burdens and set\r\nmen upon them provided with the equipment of cavalry: and having thus\r\nfurnished them forth he appointed them to go in front of the rest of\r\nthe army towards the horsemen of Croesus; and after the camel-troop he\r\nordered the infantry to follow; and behind the infantry he placed his\r\nwhole force of cavalry. Then when all his men had been placed in their\r\nseveral positions, he charged them to spare none of the other Lydians,\r\nslaying all who might come in their way, but Croesus himself they were\r\nnot to slay, not even if he should make resistance when he was captured.\r\nSuch was his charge: and he set the camels opposite the horsemen for\r\nthis reason,—because the horse has a fear of the camel and cannot endure\r\neither to see his form or to scent his smell: for this reason then the\r\ntrick had been devised, in order that the cavalry of Croesus might be\r\nuseless, that very force wherewith the Lydian king was expecting most\r\nto shine. And as they were coming together to the battle, so soon as the\r\nhorses scented the camels and saw them they turned away back, and the\r\nhopes of Croesus were at once brought to nought. The Lydians however\r\nfor their part did not upon that act as cowards, but when they perceived\r\nwhat was coming to pass they leapt from their horses and fought with\r\nthe Persians on foot. At length, however, when many had fallen on either\r\nside, the Lydians turned to flight; and having been driven within the\r\nwall of their fortress they were besieged by the Persians.\r\n\r\n81. By these then a siege had been established: but Croesus, supposing\r\nthat the siege would last a long time, proceeded to send from the\r\nfortress other messengers to his allies. For the former messengers were\r\nsent round to give notice that they should assemble at Sardis by the\r\nfifth month, but these he was sending out to ask them to come to his\r\nassistance as quickly as possible, because Croesus was being besieged.\r\n\r\n82. So then in sending to his other allies he sent also to Lacedemon.\r\nBut these too, the Spartans I mean, had themselves at this very time\r\n(for so it had fallen out) a quarrel in hand with the Argives about\r\nthe district called Thyrea. For this Thyrea, being part of the Argive\r\npossessions, the Lacedemonians had cut off and taken for themselves. Now\r\nthe whole region towards the west extending as far down as Malea 96 was\r\nthen possessed by the Argives, both the parts situated on the mainland\r\nand also the island of Kythera with the other islands. And when the\r\nArgives had come to the rescue to save their territory from being cut\r\noff from them, then the two sides came to a parley together and agreed\r\nthat three hundred should fight of each side, and whichever side had the\r\nbetter in the fight that nation should possess the disputed land: they\r\nagreed moreover that the main body of each army should withdraw to their\r\nown country, and not stand by while the contest was fought, for fear\r\nlest, if the armies were present, one side seeing their countrymen\r\nsuffering defeat should come up to their support. Having made this\r\nagreement they withdrew; and chosen men of both sides were left behind\r\nand engaged in fight with one another. So they fought and proved\r\nthemselves to be equally matched; and there were left at last of six\r\nhundred men three, on the side of the Argives Alkenor and Chromios, and\r\non the side of the Lacedemonians Othryades: these were left alive when\r\nnight came on. So then the two men of the Argives, supposing that\r\nthey were the victors, set off to run to Argos, but the Lacedemonian\r\nOthryades, after having stripped the corpses of the Argives and carried\r\ntheir arms to his own camp, remained in his place. On the next day both\r\nthe two sides came thither to inquire about the result; and for some\r\ntime both claimed the victory for themselves, the one side saying that\r\nof them more had remained alive, and the others declaring that these had\r\nfled away, whereas their own man had stood his ground and had stripped\r\nthe corpses of the other party: and at length by reason of this dispute\r\nthey fell upon one another and began to fight; and after many had fallen\r\non both sides, the Lacedemonians were the victors. The Argives then cut\r\ntheir hair short, whereas formerly they were compelled by law to wear\r\nit long, and they made a law with a curse attached to it, that from that\r\ntime forth no man of the Argives should grow the hair long nor their\r\nwomen wear ornaments of gold, until they should have won back Thyrea.\r\nThe Lacedemonians however laid down for themselves the opposite law to\r\nthis, namely that they should wear long hair from that time forward,\r\nwhereas before that time they had not their hair long. And they say that\r\nthe one man who was left alive of the three hundred, namely Othryades,\r\nbeing ashamed to to Sparta when all his comrades had been slain, slew\r\nhimself there in Thyrea.\r\n\r\n83. Such was the condition of things at Sparta when the herald from\r\nSardis arrived asking them to come to the assistance of Croesus, who was\r\nbeing besieged. And they notwithstanding their own difficulties, as\r\nsoon as they heard the news from the herald, were eager to go to his\r\nassistance; but when they had completed their preparations and their\r\nships were ready, there came another message reporting that the fortress\r\nof the Lydians had been taken and that Croesus had been made prisoner.\r\nThen (and not before) they ceased from their efforts, being grieved at\r\nthe event as at a great calamity.\r\n\r\n84. Now the taking of Sardis came about as follows:—When the fourteenth\r\nday came after Croesus began to be besieged, Cyrus made proclamation\r\nto his army, sending horsemen round to the several parts of it, that he\r\nwould give gifts to the man who should first scale the wall. After this\r\nthe army made an attempt; and when it failed, then after all the rest\r\nhad ceased from the attack, a certain Mardian whose name was Hyroiades\r\nmade an attempt to approach on that side of the citadel where no guard\r\nhad been set; for they had no fear that it would ever be taken from that\r\nside, seeing that here the citadel is precipitous and unassailable. To\r\nthis part of the wall alone Meles also, who formerly was king of Sardis,\r\ndid not carry round the lion which his concubine bore to him, the\r\nTelmessians having given decision that if the lion should be carried\r\nround the wall, Sardis should be safe from capture: and Meles having\r\ncarried it round the rest of the wall, that is to say those parts of the\r\ncitadel where the fortress was open to attack, passed over this part as\r\nbeing unassailable and precipitous: now this is a part of the city which\r\nis turned towards Tmolos. So then this 97 Mardian Hyroiades, having seen\r\non the day before how one of the Lydians had descended on that side of\r\nthe citadel to recover his helmet which had rolled down from above,\r\nand had picked it up, took thought and cast the matter about in his own\r\nmind. Then he himself 98 ascended first, and after him came up others\r\nof the Persians, and many having thus made approach, Sardis was finally\r\ntaken and the whole city was given up to plunder.\r\n\r\n85. Meanwhile to Croesus himself it happened thus:—He had a son, of whom\r\nI made mention before, who was of good disposition enough but deprived\r\nof speech. Now in his former time of prosperity Croesus had done\r\neverything that was possible for him, and besides other things which he\r\ndevised he had also sent messengers to Delphi to inquire concerning him.\r\nAnd the Pythian prophetess spoke to him thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Lydian, master of many, much blind to destiny, Croesus,\r\n  Do not desire to hear in thy halls that voice which is prayed for,\r\n  Voice of thy son; much better if this from thee were removèd,\r\n  Since he shall first utter speech in an evil day of misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nNow when the fortress was being taken, one of the Persians was about to\r\nslay Croesus taking him for another; and Croesus for his part, seeing\r\nhim coming on, cared nothing for it because of the misfortune which was\r\nupon him, and to him it was indifferent that he should be slain by the\r\nstroke; but this voiceless son, when he saw the Persian coming on, by\r\nreason of terror and affliction burst the bonds of his utterance and\r\nsaid: \"Man, slay not Croesus.\" This son, I say, uttered voice then first\r\nof all, but after this he continued to use speech for the whole time of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n86. The Persians then had obtained possession of Sardis and had taken\r\nCroesus himself prisoner, after he had reigned fourteen years and had\r\nbeen besieged fourteen days, having fulfilled the oracle in that he had\r\nbrought to an end his own great empire. So the Persians having taken him\r\nbrought him into the presence of Cyrus: and he piled up a great pyre\r\nand caused Croesus to go up upon it bound in fetters, and along with him\r\ntwice seven sons of Lydians, whether it was that he meant to dedicate\r\nthis offering as first-fruits of his victory to some god, or whether\r\nhe desired to fulfil a vow, or else had heard that Croesus was a\r\ngod-fearing man and so caused him to go up on the pyre because he wished\r\nto know if any one of the divine powers would save him, so that he\r\nshould not be burnt alive. He, they say, did this; but to Croesus as\r\nhe stood upon the pyre there came, although he was in such evil case, a\r\nmemory of the saying of Solon, how he had said with divine inspiration\r\nthat no one of the living might be called happy. And when this thought\r\ncame into his mind, they say that he sighed deeply 99 and groaned aloud,\r\nhaving been for long silent, and three times he uttered the name of\r\nSolon. Hearing this, Cyrus bade the interpreters ask Croesus who was\r\nthis person on whom he called; and they came near and asked. And\r\nCroesus for a time, it is said, kept silence when he was asked this,\r\nbut afterwards being pressed he said: \"One whom more than much wealth I\r\nshould have desired to have speech with all monarchs.\" Then, since his\r\nwords were of doubtful import, they asked again of that which he said;\r\nand as they were urgent with him and gave him no peace, he told how once\r\nSolon an Athenian had come, and having inspected all his wealth had made\r\nlight of it, with such and such words; and how all had turned out for\r\nhim according as Solon had said, not speaking at all especially with\r\na view to Croesus himself, but with a view to the whole human race\r\nand especially those who seem to themselves to be happy men. And while\r\nCroesus related these things, already the pyre was lighted and the edges\r\nof it round about were burning. Then they say that Cyrus, hearing\r\nfrom the interpreters what Croesus had said, changed his purpose\r\nand considered that he himself also was but a man, and that he was\r\ndelivering another man, who had been not inferior to himself in\r\nfelicity, alive to the fire; and moreover he feared the requital, and\r\nreflected that there was nothing of that which men possessed which was\r\nsecure; therefore, they say, he ordered them to extinguish as quickly as\r\npossible the fire that was burning, and to bring down Croesus and those\r\nwho were with him from the pyre; and they using endeavours were not able\r\nnow to get the mastery of the flames.\r\n\r\n87. Then it is related by the Lydians that Croesus, having learned how\r\nCyrus had changed his mind, and seeing that every one was trying to put\r\nout the fire but that they were no longer able to check it, cried aloud\r\nentreating Apollo that if any gift had ever been given by him which had\r\nbeen acceptable to the god, he would come to his aid and rescue him from\r\nthe evil which was now upon him. So he with tears entreated the god, and\r\nsuddenly, they say, after clear sky and calm weather clouds gathered and\r\na storm burst, and it rained with a very violent shower, and the pyre\r\nwas extinguished. Then Cyrus, having perceived that Croesus was a lover\r\nof the gods and a good man, caused him to be brought down from the pyre\r\nand asked him as follows: \"Croesus, tell me who of all men was it who\r\npersuaded thee to march upon my land and so to become an enemy to me\r\ninstead of a friend?\" and he said: \"O king, I did this to thy felicity\r\nand to my own misfortune, and the causer of this was the god of the\r\nHellenes, who incited me to march with my army. For no one is so\r\nsenseless as to choose of his own will war rather peace, since in peace\r\nthe sons bury their fathers, but in war the fathers bury their sons.\r\nBut it was pleasing, I suppose, to the divine powers that these things\r\nshould come to pass thus.\"\r\n\r\n88. So he spoke, and Cyrus loosed his bonds and caused him to sit near\r\nhimself and paid to him much regard, and he marvelled both himself and\r\nall who were about him at the sight of Croesus. And Croesus wrapt in\r\nthought was silent; but after a time, turning round and seeing the\r\nPersians plundering the city of the Lydians, he said: \"O king, must I\r\nsay to thee that which I chance to have in my thought, or must I keep\r\nsilent in this my present fortune?\" Then Cyrus bade him say boldly\r\nwhatsoever he desired; and he asked him saying: \"What is the business\r\nthat this great multitude of men is doing with so much eagerness?\" and\r\nhe said: \"They are plundering thy city and carrying away thy wealth.\"\r\nAnd Croesus answered: \"Neither is it my city that they are plundering\r\nnor my wealth which they are carrying away; for I have no longer any\r\nproperty in these things: but it is thy wealth that they are carrying\r\nand driving away.\"\r\n\r\n89. And Cyrus was concerned by that which Croesus had said, and he\r\ncaused all the rest to withdraw and asked Croesus what he discerned for\r\nhis advantage as regards that which was being done; and he said: \"Since\r\nthe gods gave me to thee as a slave, I think it right if I discern\r\nanything more than others to signify it to thee. The Persians, who are\r\nby nature unruly, 100 are without wealth: if therefore thou shalt suffer\r\nthem to carry off in plunder great wealth and to take possession of it,\r\nthen it is to be looked for that thou wilt experience this result, thou\r\nmust expect namely that whosoever gets possession of the largest share\r\nwill make insurrection against thee. Now therefore, if that which I say\r\nis pleasing to thee, do this:—set spearmen of thy guard to watch at all\r\nthe gates, and let these take away the things, and say to the men who\r\nwere bearing them out of the city that they must first be tithed for\r\nZeus: and thus thou on the one hand wilt not be hated by them for taking\r\naway the things by force, and they on the other will willingly let the\r\nthings go, 101 acknowledging within themselves that thou art doing that\r\nwhich is just.\"\r\n\r\n90. Hearing this, Cyrus was above measure pleased, because he thought\r\nthat Croesus advised well; and he commended him much and enjoined the\r\nspearmen of his guard to perform that which Croesus had advised: and\r\nafter that he spoke to Croesus thus: \"Croesus, since thou art prepared,\r\nlike a king as thou art, to do good deeds and speak good words,\r\ntherefore ask me for a gift, whatsoever thou desirest to be given thee\r\nforthwith.\" And he said: \"Master, thou wilt most do me a pleasure if\r\nthou wilt permit me to send to the god of the Hellenes, whom I honoured\r\nmost of all gods, these fetters, and to ask him whether it is accounted\r\nby him right to deceive those who do well to him.\" Then Cyrus asked him\r\nwhat accusation he made against the god, that he thus requested; and\r\nCroesus repeated to him all that had been in his mind, and the answers\r\nof the Oracles, and especially the votive offerings, and how he had been\r\nincited by the prophecy to march upon the Persians: and thus speaking he\r\ncame back again to the request that it might be permitted to him to make\r\nthis reproach 102 against the god. And Cyrus laughed and said: \"Not this\r\nonly shalt thou obtain from me, Croesus, but also whatsoever thou mayst\r\ndesire of me at any time.\" Hearing this Croesus sent certain of the\r\nLydians to Delphi, enjoining them to lay the fetters upon the threshold\r\nof the temple and to ask the god whether he felt no shame that he had\r\nincited Croesus by his prophecies to march upon the Persians, persuading\r\nhim that he should bring to an end the empire of Cyrus, seeing that\r\nthese were the first-fruits of spoil which he had won from it,—at the\r\nsame time displaying the fetters. This they were to ask, and moreover\r\nalso whether it was thought right by the gods of the Hellenes to\r\npractice ingratitude.\r\n\r\n91. When the Lydians came and repeated that which they were enjoined to\r\nsay, it is related that the Pythian prophetess spoke as follows: \"The\r\nfated destiny it is impossible even for a god to escape. And Croesus\r\npaid the debt due for the sin of his fifth ancestor, who being one of\r\nthe spearmen of the Heracleidai followed the treacherous device of a\r\nwoman, and having slain his master took possession of his royal dignity,\r\nwhich belonged not to him of right. And although Loxias eagerly desired\r\nthat the calamity of Sardis might come upon the sons of Croesus and not\r\nupon Croesus himself, it was not possible for him to draw the Destinies\r\naside from their course; but so much as these granted he brought to\r\npass, and gave it as a gift to Croesus: for he put off the taking of\r\nSardis by three years; and let Croesus be assured that he was taken\r\nprisoner later by these years than the fated time: moreover secondly, he\r\nassisted him when he was about to be burnt. And as to the oracle which\r\nwas given, Croesus finds fault with good ground: for Loxias told him\r\nbeforehand that if he should march upon the Persians he should destroy\r\na great empire: and he upon hearing this, if he wished to take counsel\r\nwell, ought to have sent and asked further whether the god meant his\r\nown empire or that of Cyrus: but as he did not comprehend that which was\r\nuttered and did not ask again, let him pronounce himself to be the cause\r\nof that which followed. To him also 103 when he consulted the Oracle for\r\nthe last time Loxias said that which he said concerning a mule; but this\r\nalso he failed to comprehend: for Cyrus was in fact this mule, seeing\r\nthat he was born of parents who were of two different races, his mother\r\nbeing of nobler descent and his father of less noble: for she was a\r\nMedian woman, daughter of Astyages and king of the Medes, but he was a\r\nPersian, one of a race subject to the Medes, and being inferior in all\r\nrespects he was the husband of one who was his royal mistress.\" Thus the\r\nPythian prophetess replied to the Lydians, and they brought the answer\r\nback to Sardis and repeated it to Croesus; and he, when he heard it,\r\nacknowledged that the fault was his own and not that of the god. With\r\nregard then to the empire of Croesus and the first conquest of Ionia, it\r\nhappened thus.\r\n\r\n92. Now there are in Hellas many other votive offerings made by Croesus\r\nand not only those which have been mentioned: for first at Thebes of the\r\nBoeotians there is a tripod of gold, which he dedicated to the Ismenian\r\nApollo; then at Ephesos there are the golden cows and the greater number\r\nof the pillars of the temple; and in the temple of Athene Pronaia at\r\nDelphi a large golden shield. These were still remaining down to my own\r\ntime, but others of his votive offerings have perished: and the votive\r\nofferings of Croesus at Branchidai of the Milesians were, as I am told,\r\nequal in weight and similar to those at Delphi. Now those which he sent\r\nto Delphi and to the temple of Amphiaraos he dedicated of his own goods\r\nand as first-fruits of the wealth inherited from his father; but the\r\nother offerings were made of the substance of a man who was his foe, who\r\nbefore Croesus became king had been factious against him and had joined\r\nin endeavouring to make Pantaleon ruler of the Lydians. Now Pantaleon\r\nwas a son of Alyattes and a brother of Croesus, but not by the same\r\nmother, for Croesus was born to Alyattes of a Carian woman, but\r\nPantaleon of an Ionian. And when Croesus had gained possession of the\r\nkingdom by the gift of his father, he put to death the man who opposed\r\nhim, drawing him upon the carding-comb; and his property, which even\r\nbefore that time he had vowed to dedicate, he then offered in the manner\r\nmentioned to those shrines which have been named. About his votive\r\nofferings let it suffice to have said so much.\r\n\r\n93. Of marvels to be recorded the land of Lydia has no great store as\r\ncompared with other lands, 104 excepting the gold-dust which is carried\r\ndown from Tmolos; but one work it has to show which is larger far than\r\nany other except only those in Egypt and Babylon: for there is there the\r\nsepulchral monument of Alyattes the father of Croesus, of which the base\r\nis made of larger stones and the rest of the monument is of earth piled\r\nup. And this was built by contributions of those who practised trade and\r\nof the artisans and the girls who plied their traffic there; and still\r\nthere existed to my own time boundary-stones five in number erected upon\r\nthe monument above, on which were carved inscriptions telling how much\r\nof the work was done by each class; and upon measurement it was found\r\nthat the work of the girls was the greatest in amount. For the daughters\r\nof the common people in Lydia practice prostitution one and all, to\r\ngather for themselves dowries, continuing this until the time when they\r\nmarry; and the girls give themselves away in marriage. Now the circuit\r\nof the monument is six furlongs and two hundred feet, 105 and the\r\nbreadth is thirteen hundred feet. 106 And adjoining the monument is a\r\ngreat lake, which the Lydians say has a never-failing supply of water,\r\nand it is called the lake of Gyges. 107 Such is the nature of this\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\n94. Now the Lydians have very nearly the same customs as the Hellenes,\r\nwith the exception that they prostitute their female children; and they\r\nwere the first of men, so far as we know, who struck and used coin of\r\ngold or silver; and also they were the first retail-traders. And the\r\nLydians themselves say that the games which are now in use among them\r\nand among the Hellenes were also their invention. These they say were\r\ninvented among them at the same time as they colonised Tyrsenia, 108 and\r\nthis is the account they give of them:—In the reign of Atys the son of\r\nManes their king there came to be a grievous dearth over the whole\r\nof Lydia; and the Lydians for a time continued to endure it, but\r\nafterwards, as it did not cease, they sought for remedies; and one\r\ndevised one thing and another of them devised another thing. And then\r\nwere discovered, they say, the ways of playing with the dice and the\r\nknucklebones and the ball, and all the other games excepting draughts\r\n(for the discovery of this last is not claimed by the Lydians). These\r\ngames they invented as a resource against the famine, and thus they used\r\nto do:—on one of the days they would play games all the time in order\r\nthat they might not feel the want of food, and on the next they ceased\r\nfrom their games and had food: and thus they went on for eighteen years.\r\nAs however the evil did not slacken but pressed upon them ever more\r\nand more, therefore their king divided the whole Lydian people into two\r\nparts, and he appointed by lot one part to remain and the other to go\r\nforth from the land; and the king appointed himself to be over that one\r\nof the parts which had the lot to stay in the land, and his son to be\r\nover that which was departing; and the name of his son was Tyrsenos.\r\nSo the one party of them, having obtained the lot to go forth from the\r\nland, went down to the sea at Smyrna and built ships for themselves,\r\nwherein they placed all the movable goods which they had and sailed away\r\nto seek for means of living and a land to dwell in; until after passing\r\nby many nations they came at last to the land of the Ombricans, 109 and\r\nthere they founded cities and dwell up to the present time: and changing\r\ntheir name they were called after the king's son who led them out from\r\nhome, not Lydians but Tyrsenians, taking the name from him.\r\n\r\nThe Lydians then had been made subject to the Persians as I say:\r\n\r\n95, and after this our history proceeds to inquire about Cyrus, who he\r\nwas that destroyed the empire of Croesus, and about the Persians, in\r\nwhat manner they obtained the lead of Asia. Following then the report\r\nof some of the Persians,—those I mean who do not desire to glorify the\r\nhistory of Cyrus but to speak that which is in fact true,—according to\r\ntheir report, I say, I shall write; but I could set forth also the other\r\nforms of the story in three several ways.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians ruled Upper Asia 110 for five hundred and twenty years,\r\nand from them the Medes were the first who made revolt. These having\r\nfought for their freedom with the Assyrians proved themselves good men,\r\nand thus they pushed off the yoke of slavery from themselves and were\r\nset free; and after them the other nations also did the same as the\r\nMedes: and when all on the continent were thus independent, they ed\r\nagain to despotic rule as follows:—\r\n\r\n96. There appeared among the Medes a man of great ability whose name\r\nwas Deïokes, and this man was the son of Phraortes. This Deïokes, having\r\nformed a desire for despotic power, did thus:—whereas the Medes dwelt\r\nin separate villages, he, being even before that time of great repute in\r\nhis own village, set himself to practise just dealing much more and\r\nwith greater zeal than before; and this he did although there was much\r\nlawlessness throughout the whole of Media, and although he knew that\r\ninjustice is ever at feud with justice. And the Medes of the same\r\nvillage, seeing his manners, chose him for their judge. So he, since\r\nhe was aiming at power, was upright and just, and doing thus he had no\r\nlittle praise from his fellow-citizens, insomuch that those of the other\r\nvillages learning that Deïokes was a man who more than all others gave\r\ndecision rightly, whereas before this they had been wont to suffer from\r\nunjust judgments, themselves also when they heard it came gladly to\r\nDeïokes to have their causes determined, and at last they trusted the\r\nbusiness to no one else.\r\n\r\n97. Then, as more and more continually kept coming to him, because men\r\nlearnt that his decisions proved to be according to the truth, Deïokes\r\nperceiving that everything was referred to himself would no longer\r\nsit in the place where he used formerly to sit in public to determine\r\ncauses, and said that he would determine causes no more, for it was not\r\nprofitable for him to neglect his own affairs and to determine causes\r\nfor his neighbours all through the day. So then, since robbery and\r\nlawlessness prevailed even much more in the villages than they did\r\nbefore, the Medes having assembled together in one place considered with\r\none another and spoke about the state in which they were: and I suppose\r\nthe friends of Deïokes spoke much to this effect: \"Seeing that we are\r\nnot able to dwell in the land under the present order of things, let\r\nus set up a king from among ourselves, and thus the land will be well\r\ngoverned and we ourselves shall turn to labour, and shall not be ruined\r\nby lawlessness.\" By some such words as these they persuaded themselves\r\nto have a king.\r\n\r\n98. And when they straightway proposed the question whom they should set\r\nup to be king, Deïokes was much put forward and commended by every one,\r\nuntil at last they agreed that he should be their king. And he bade them\r\nbuild for him a palace worthy of the royal dignity and strengthen him\r\nwith a guard of spearmen. And the Medes did so: for they built him a\r\nlarge and strong palace in that part of the land which he told them, and\r\nthey allowed him to select spearmen from all the Medes. And when he\r\nhad obtained the rule over them, he compelled the Medes to make one\r\nfortified city and pay chief attention to this, having less regard to\r\nthe other cities. And as the Medes obeyed him in this also, he built\r\nlarge and strong walls, those which are now called Agbatana, standing\r\nin circles one within the other. And this wall is so contrived that one\r\ncircle is higher than the next by the height of the battlements alone.\r\nAnd to some extent, I suppose, the nature of the ground, seeing that it\r\nis on a hill, assists towards this end; but much more was it produced\r\nby art, since the circles are in all seven in number. 111 And within the\r\nlast circle are the royal palace and the treasure-houses. The largest\r\nof these walls is in size about equal to the circuit of the wall round\r\nAthens; and of the first circle the battlements are white, of the second\r\nblack, of the third crimson, of the fourth blue, of the fifth red: thus\r\nare the battlements of all the circles coloured with various tints, and\r\nthe two last have their battlements one of them overlaid with silver and\r\nthe other with gold.\r\n\r\n99. These walls then Deïokes built for himself and round his own palace,\r\nand the people he commanded to dwell round about the wall. And after\r\nall was built, Deïokes established the rule, which he was the first to\r\nestablish, ordaining that none should enter into the presence of the\r\nking, but that they deal with him always through messengers; and that\r\nthe king should be seen by no one; and moreover that to laugh or to spit\r\nin presence is unseemly, and this last for every one without exception.\r\n112 Now he surrounded himself with this state 113 to the end that his\r\nfellows, who had been brought up with him and were of no meaner family\r\nnor behind him in manly virtue, might not be grieved by seeing him\r\nand make plots against him, but that being unseen by them he might be\r\nthought to be of different mould.\r\n\r\n100. Having set these things in order and strengthened himself in his\r\ndespotism, he was severe in preserving justice; and the people used\r\nto write down their causes and send them in to his presence, and he\r\ndetermined the questions which were brought in to him and sent them out\r\nagain. Thus he used to do about the judgment of causes; and he also took\r\norder for this, that is to say, if he heard that any one was behaving in\r\nan unruly manner, he sent for him and punished him according as each act\r\nof wrong deserved, and he had watchers and listeners about all the land\r\nover which he ruled.\r\n\r\n101. Deïokes then united the Median race alone, and was ruler of this:\r\nand of the Medes there are the tribes which here follow, namely, Busai,\r\nParetakenians, Struchates, Arizantians, Budians, Magians: the tribes of\r\nthe Medes are so many in number.\r\n\r\n102. Now the son of Deïokes was Phraortes, who when Deïokes was dead,\r\nhaving been king for three-and-fifty years, received the power in\r\nsuccession; and having received it he was not satisfied to be ruler of\r\nthe Medes alone, but marched upon the Persians; and attacking them first\r\nbefore others, he made these first subject to the Medes. After this,\r\nbeing ruler of these two nations and both of them strong, he proceeded\r\nto subdue Asia going from one nation to another, until at last he\r\nmarched against the Assyrians, those Assyrians I mean who dwelt at\r\nNineveh, and who formerly had been rulers of the whole, but at that time\r\nthey were left without support their allies having revolted from them,\r\nthough at home they were prosperous enough. 114 Phraortes marched, I\r\nsay, against these, and was both himself slain, after he had reigned\r\ntwo-and-twenty years, and the greater part of his army was destroyed.\r\n\r\n103. When Phraortes had brought his life to an end, Kyaxares the son of\r\nPhraortes, the son of Deïokes, received the power. This king is said\r\nto have been yet much more warlike than his forefathers; and he first\r\nbanded the men of Asia into separate divisions, that is to say, he first\r\narrayed apart from one another the spearmen and the archers and the\r\nhorsemen, for before that time they were all mingled together without\r\ndistinction. This was he who fought with the Lydians when the day became\r\nnight as they fought, and who also united under his rule the whole of\r\nAsia above the river Halys. 115 And having gathered together all his\r\nsubjects he marched upon Nineveh to avenge his father, and also because\r\nhe desired to conquer that city. And when he had fought a battle with\r\nthe Assyrians and had defeated them, while he was sitting down before\r\nNineveh there came upon him a great army of Scythians, 116 and the\r\nleader of them was Madyas the son of Protohyas, king of the Scythians.\r\nThese had invaded Asia after driving the Kimmerians out of Europe, and\r\nin pursuit of them as they fled they had come to the land of Media.\r\n\r\n104. Now from the Maiotian lake to the river Phasis and to the land of\r\nthe Colchians is a journey of thirty days for one without encumbrance;\r\n117 and from Colchis it is not far to pass over to Media, for there\r\nis only one nation between them, the Saspeirians, and passing by this\r\nnation you are in Media. However the Scythians did not make their\r\ninvasion by this way, but turned aside from it to go by the upper road\r\n118 which is much longer, keeping Mount Caucasus on their right hand.\r\nThen the Medes fought with the Scythians, and having been worsted in the\r\nbattle they lost their power, and the Scythians obtained rule over all\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n105. Thence they went on to invade Egypt; and when they were in Syria\r\nwhich is called Palestine, Psammetichos king of Egypt met them; and by\r\ngifts and entreaties he turned them from their purpose, so that they\r\nshould not advance any further: and as they retreated, when they came\r\nto the city of Ascalon in Syria, most of the Scythians passed through\r\nwithout doing any damage, but a few of them who had stayed behind\r\nplundered the temple of Aphrodite Urania. Now this temple, as I find\r\nby inquiry, is the most ancient of all the temples which belong to this\r\ngoddess; for the temple in Cyprus was founded from this, as the people\r\nof Cyprus themselves report, and it was the Phenicians who founded the\r\ntemple in Kythera, coming from this land of Syria. So these Scythians\r\nwho had plundered the temple at Ascalon, and their descendants for ever,\r\nwere smitten by the divinity 119 with a disease which made them women\r\ninstead of men: and the Scythians say that it was for this reason\r\nthat they were diseased, and that for this reason travellers who visit\r\nScythia now, see among them the affection of those who by the Scythians\r\nare called Enareës.\r\n\r\n106. For eight-and-twenty years then the Scythians were rulers of Asia,\r\nand by their unruliness and reckless behaviour everything was ruined;\r\nfor on the one hand they exacted that in tribute from each people which\r\nthey laid upon them, 120 and apart from the tribute they rode about and\r\ncarried off by force the possessions of each tribe. Then Kyaxares with\r\nthe Medes, having invited the greater number of them to a banquet, made\r\nthem drunk and slew them; and thus the Medes recovered their power,\r\nand had rule over the same nations as before; and they also took\r\nNineveh,—the manner how it was taken I shall set forth in another\r\nhistory, 121—and made the Assyrians subject to them excepting only the\r\nland of Babylon.\r\n\r\n107. After this Kyaxares died, having reigned forty years including\r\nthose years during which the Scythians had rule, and Astyages son of\r\nKyaxares received from him the kingdom. To him was born a daughter whom\r\nhe named Mandane; and in his sleep it seemed to him that there passed\r\nfrom her so much water as to fill his city and also to flood the whole\r\nof Asia. This dream he delivered over 122 to the Magian interpreters of\r\ndreams, and when he heard from them the truth at each point he became\r\nafraid. And afterwards when this Mandane was of an age to have a\r\nhusband, he did not give her in marriage to any one of the Medes who\r\nwere his peers, because he feared the vision; but he gave her to a\r\nPersian named Cambyses, whom he found to be of a good descent and of a\r\nquiet disposition, counting him to be in station much below a Mede of\r\nmiddle rank.\r\n\r\n108. And when Mandane was married to Cambyses, in the first year\r\nAstyages saw another vision. It seemed to him that from the womb of this\r\ndaughter a vine grew, and this vine overspread the whole of Asia. Having\r\nseen this vision and delivered it to the interpreters of dreams, he sent\r\nfor his daughter, being then with child, to come from the land of the\r\nPersians. And when she had come he kept watch over her, desiring to\r\ndestroy that which should be born of her; for the Magian interpreters\r\nof dreams signified to him that the offspring of his daughter should\r\nbe king in his room. Astyages then desiring to guard against this, when\r\nCyrus was born, called Harpagos, a man who was of kin near him and whom\r\nhe trusted above all the other Medes, and had made him manager of all\r\nhis affairs; and to him he said as follows: \"Neglect not by any means,\r\nHarpagos, the matter which I shall lay upon thee to do, and beware lest\r\nthou set me aside, 123 and choosing the advantage of others instead,\r\nbring thyself afterwards to destruction. Take the child which Mandane\r\nbore, and carry it to thy house and slay it; and afterwards bury it in\r\nwhatsoever manner thou thyself desirest.\" To this he made answer: \"O\r\nking, never yet in any past time didst thou discern in me an offence\r\nagainst thee, and I keep watch over myself also with a view to the time\r\nthat comes after, that I may not commit any error towards thee. If it\r\nis indeed thy pleasure that this should so be done, my service at least\r\nmust be fitly rendered.\"\r\n\r\n109. Thus he made answer, and when the child had been delivered to him\r\nadorned as for death, Harpagos went weeping to his wife all the words\r\nwhich had been spoken by Astyages. And she said to him: \"Now, therefore,\r\nwhat is it in thy mind to do?\" and he made answer: \"Not according as\r\nAstyages enjoined: for not even if he shall come to be yet more out\r\nof his senses and more mad than he now is, will I agree to his will or\r\nserve him in such a murder as this. And for many reasons I will not slay\r\nthe child; first because he is a kin to me, and then because Astyages is\r\nold and without male issue, and if after he is dead the power shall come\r\nthrough me, does not the greatest of dangers then await me? To secure\r\nme, this child must die; but one of the servants of Astyages must be the\r\nslayer of it, and not one of mine.\"\r\n\r\n110. Thus he spoke, and straightway sent a messenger to that one of the\r\nherdsmen of Astyages who he knew fed his herds on the pastures which\r\nwere most suitable for his purpose, and on the mountains most haunted by\r\nwild beasts. The name of this man was Mitradates, and he was married to\r\none who was his fellow-slave; and the name of the woman to whom he was\r\nmarried was Kyno in the tongue of the Hellenes and in the Median tongue\r\nSpaco, for what the Hellenes call kyna (bitch) the Medes call spaca.\r\nNow, it was on the skirts of the mountains that this herdsman had his\r\ncattle-pastures, from Agbatana towards the North Wind and towards the\r\nEuxine Sea. For here in the direction of the Saspeirians the Median land\r\nis very mountainous and lofty and thickly covered with forests; but\r\nthe rest of the land of Media is all level plain. So when this herdsman\r\ncame, being summoned with much urgency, Harpagos said these words:\r\n\"Astyages bids thee take this child and place it on the most desolate\r\npart of the mountains, so that it may perish as quickly as possible.\r\nAnd he bade me to say that if thou do not kill it, but in any way shalt\r\npreserve it from death, he will slay thee by the most evil kind of\r\ndestruction: 124 and I have been appointed to see that the child is laid\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\n111. Having heard this and having taken up the child, the herdsman went\r\nback by the way he came, and arrived at his dwelling. And his wife also,\r\nas it seems, having been every day on the point of bearing a child, by\r\na providential chance brought her child to birth just at that time, when\r\nthe herdsman was gone to the city. And both were in anxiety, each for\r\nthe other, the man having fear about the child-bearing of his wife, and\r\nthe woman about the cause why Harpagos had sent to summon her husband,\r\nnot having been wont to do so aforetime. So as soon as he ed and stood\r\nbefore her, the woman seeing him again beyond her hopes was the first\r\nto speak, and asked him for what purpose Harpagos had sent for him so\r\nurgently. And he said: \"Wife, when I came to the city I saw and heard\r\nthat which I would I had not seen, and which I should wish had never\r\nchanced to those whom we serve. For the house of Harpagos was all full\r\nof mourning, and I being astonished thereat went within: and as soon as\r\nI entered I saw laid out to view an infant child gasping for breath\r\nand screaming, which was adorned with gold ornaments and embroidered\r\nclothing: and when Harpagos saw me he bade me forthwith to take up the\r\nchild and carry it away and lay it on that part of the mountains which\r\nis most haunted by wild beasts, saying that it was Astyages who laid\r\nthis task upon me, and using to me many threats, if I should fail to do\r\nthis. And I took it up and bore it away, supposing that it was the\r\nchild of some one of the servants of the house, for never could I have\r\nsupposed whence it really was; but I marvelled to see it adorned with\r\ngold and raiment, and I marvelled also because mourning was made for it\r\nopenly in the house of Harpagos. And straightway as we went by the road,\r\nI learnt the whole of the matter from the servant who went with me out\r\nof the city and placed in my hands the babe, namely that it was in truth\r\nthe son of Mandane the daughter of Astyages, and of Cambyses the son of\r\nCyrus, and that Astyages bade slay it. And now here it is.\"\r\n\r\n112. And as he said this the herdsman uncovered it and showed it to\r\nher. And she, seeing that the child was large and of fair form, wept and\r\nclung to the knees of her husband, beseeching him by no means to lay it\r\nforth. But he said that he could not do otherwise than so, for watchers\r\nwould come backwards and forwards sent by Harpagos to see that this was\r\ndone, and he would perish by a miserable death if he should fail to do\r\nthis. And as she could not after all persuade her husband, the wife next\r\nsaid as follows: \"Since then I am unable to persuade thee not to lay it\r\nforth, do thou this which I shall tell thee, if indeed it needs must be\r\nseen laid forth. I also have borne a child, but I have borne it dead.\r\nTake this and expose it, and let us rear the child of the daughter of\r\nAstyages as if it were our own. Thus thou wilt not be found out doing\r\na wrong to those whom we serve, nor shall we have taken ill counsel\r\nfor ourselves; for the dead child will obtain a royal burial and the\r\nsurviving one will not lose his life.\"\r\n\r\n113. To the herdsman it seemed that, the case standing thus, his wife\r\nspoke well, and forthwith he did so. The child which he was bearing\r\nto put to death, this he delivered to his wife, and his own, which was\r\ndead, he took and placed in the chest in which he had been bearing the\r\nother; and having adorned it with all the adornment of the other child,\r\nhe bore it to the most desolate part of the mountains and placed it\r\nthere. And when the third day came after the child had been laid forth,\r\nthe herdsman went to the city, leaving one of his under-herdsmen to\r\nwatch there, and when he came to the house of Harpagos he said that he\r\nwas ready to display the dead body of the child; and Harpagos sent the\r\nmost trusted of his spearmen, and through them he saw and buried the\r\nherdsman's child. This then had had burial, but him who was afterwards\r\ncalled Cyrus the wife of the herdsman had received, and was bringing him\r\nup, giving him no doubt some other name, not Cyrus.\r\n\r\n114. And when the boy was ten years old, it happened with regard to him\r\nas follows, and this made him known. He was playing in the village in\r\nwhich were stalls for oxen, he was playing there, I say, with other boys\r\nof his age in the road. And the boys in their play chose as their king\r\nthis one who was called the son of the herdsman: and he set some of them\r\nto build palaces and others to be spearmen of his guard, and one of them\r\nno doubt he appointed to be the eye of the king, and to one he gave the\r\noffice of bearing the messages, 12401 appointing a work for each one\r\nseverally. Now one of these boys who was playing with the rest, the son\r\nof Artembares a man of repute among the Medes, did not do that which\r\nCyrus appointed him to do; therefore Cyrus bade the other boys seize him\r\nhand and foot, 125 and when they obeyed his command he dealt with the\r\nboy very roughly, scourging him. But he, so soon as he was let go, being\r\nmade much more angry because he considered that he had been treated with\r\nindignity, went down to the city and complained to his father of the\r\ntreatment which he had met with from Cyrus, calling him not Cyrus, for\r\nthis was not yet his name, but the son of the herdsman of Astyages. And\r\nArtembares in the anger of the moment went at once to Astyages, taking\r\nthe boy with him, and he declared that he had suffered things that were\r\nunfitting and said: \"O king, by thy slave, the son of a herdsman, we\r\nhave been thus outraged,\" showing him the shoulders of his son.\r\n\r\n115. And Astyages having heard and seen this, wishing to punish the boy\r\nto avenge the honour of Artembares, sent for both the herdsman and his\r\nson. And when both were present, Astyages looked at Cyrus and said:\r\n\"Didst thou dare, being the son of so mean a father as this, to treat\r\nwith such unseemly insult the son of this man who is first in my\r\nfavour?\" And he replied thus: \"Master, I did so to him with right. For\r\nthe boys of the village, of whom he also was one, in their play set me\r\nup as king over them, for I appeared to them most fitted for this place.\r\nNow the other boys did what I commanded them, but this one disobeyed\r\nand paid no regard, until at last he received the punishment due. If\r\ntherefore for this I am worthy to suffer any evil, here I stand before\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\n116. While the boy thus spoke, there came upon Astyages a sense of\r\nrecognition of him and the lineaments of his face seemed to him to\r\nresemble his own, and his answer appeared to be somewhat over free for\r\nhis station, while the time of the laying forth seemed to agree with the\r\nage of the boy. Being struck with amazement by these things, for a\r\ntime he was speechless; and having at length with difficulty recovered\r\nhimself, he said, desiring to dismiss Artembares, in order that he might\r\nget the herdsman by himself alone and examine him: \"Artembares, I will\r\nso order these things that thou and thy son shall have no cause to\r\nfind fault\"; and so he dismissed Artembares, and the servants upon the\r\ncommand of Astyages led Cyrus within. And when the herdsman was left\r\nalone with the king, Astyages being alone with him asked whence he had\r\nreceived the boy, and who it was who had delivered the boy to him.\r\nAnd the herdsman said that he was his own son, and that the mother was\r\nliving with him still as his wife. But Astyages said that he was not\r\nwell advised in desiring to be brought to extreme necessity, and as he\r\nsaid this he made a sign to the spearmen of his guard to seize him. So\r\nhe, as he was being led away to the torture, 126 then declared the story\r\nas it really was; and beginning from the beginning he went through the\r\nwhole, telling the truth about it, and finally ended with entreaties,\r\nasking that he would grant him pardon.\r\n\r\n117. So when the herdsman had made known the truth, Astyages now cared\r\nless about him, but with Harpagos he was very greatly displeased and\r\nbade his spearmen summon him. And when Harpagos came, Astyages asked\r\nhim thus: \"By what death, Harpagos, didst thou destroy the child whom I\r\ndelivered to thee, born of my daughter?\" and Harpagos, seeing that\r\nthe herdsman was in the king's palace, turned not to any false way of\r\nspeech, lest he should be convicted and found out, but said as follows:\r\n\"O king, so soon as I received the child, I took counsel and considered\r\nhow I should do according to thy mind, and how without offence to thy\r\ncommand I might not be guilty of murder against thy daughter and against\r\nthyself. I did therefore thus:—I called this herdsman and delivered the\r\nchild to him, saying first that thou wert he who bade him slay it—and in\r\nthis at least I did not lie, for thou didst so command. I delivered it,\r\nI say, to this man commanding him to place it upon a desolate mountain,\r\nand to stay by it and watch it until it should die, threatening him with\r\nall kinds of punishment if he should fail to accomplish this. And when\r\nhe had done that which was ordered and the child was dead, I sent the\r\nmost trusted of my eunuchs and through them I saw and buried the child.\r\nThus, O king, it happened about this matter, and the child had this\r\ndeath which I say.\"\r\n\r\n118. So Harpagos declared the truth, and Astyages concealed the anger\r\nwhich he kept against him for that which had come to pass, and first he\r\nrelated the matter over again to Harpagos according as he had been told\r\nit by the herdsman, and afterwards, when it had been thus repeated by\r\nhim, he ended by saying that the child was alive and that that which had\r\ncome to pass was well, \"for,\" continued he, \"I was greatly troubled by\r\nthat which had been done to this child, and I thought it no light thing\r\nthat I had been made at variance with my daughter. Therefore consider\r\nthat this is a happy change of fortune, and first send thy son to be\r\nwith the boy who is newly come, and then, seeing that I intend to make a\r\nsacrifice of thanksgiving for the preservation of the boy to those gods\r\nto whom that honour belongs, be here thyself to dine with me.\"\r\n\r\n119. When Harpagos heard this, he did reverence and thought it a great\r\nmatter that his offence had turned out for his profit and moreover that\r\nhe had been invited to dinner with happy augury; 127 and so he went to\r\nhis house. And having entered it straightway, he sent forth his son, for\r\nhe had one only son of about thirteen years old, bidding him go to the\r\npalace of Astyages and do whatsoever the king should command; and he\r\nhimself being overjoyed told his wife that which had befallen him. But\r\nAstyages, when the son of Harpagos arrived, cut his throat and divided\r\nhim limb from limb, and having roasted some pieces of the flesh and\r\nboiled others he caused them to be dressed for eating and kept them\r\nready. And when the time arrived for dinner and the other guests were\r\npresent and also Harpagos, then before the other guests and before\r\nAstyages himself were placed tables covered with flesh of sheep; but\r\nbefore Harpagos was placed the flesh of his own son, all but the head\r\nand the hands and the feet, 128 and these were laid aside covered up\r\nin a basket. Then when it seemed that Harpagos was satisfied with food,\r\nAstyages asked him whether he had been pleased with the banquet; and\r\nwhen Harpagos said that he had been very greatly pleased, they who had\r\nbeen commanded to do this brought to him the head of his son covered\r\nup, together with the hands and the feet; and standing near they\r\nbade Harpagos uncover and take of them that which he desired. So when\r\nHarpagos obeyed and uncovered, he saw the remains of his son; and seeing\r\nthem he was not overcome with amazement but contained himself: and\r\nAstyages asked him whether he perceived of what animal he had been\r\neating the flesh: and he said that he perceived, and that whatsoever\r\nthe king might do was well pleasing to him. Thus having made answer and\r\ntaking up the parts of the flesh which still remained he went to his\r\nhouse; and after that, I suppose, he would gather all the parts together\r\nand bury them.\r\n\r\n120. On Harpagos Astyages laid this penalty; and about Cyrus he took\r\nthought, and summoned the same men of the Magians who had given judgment\r\nabout his dream in the manner which has been said: and when they came,\r\nAstyages asked how they had given judgment about his vision; and they\r\nspoke according to the same manner, saying that the child must have\r\nbecome king if he had lived on and had not died before. He made answer\r\nto them thus: \"The child is alive and not dead: 129 and while he was\r\ndwelling in the country, the boys of the village appointed him king; and\r\nhe performed completely all those things which they do who are really\r\nkings; for he exercised rule, 130 appointed to their places spearmen\r\nof the guard and doorkeepers and bearers of messages and all else. Now\r\ntherefore, to what does it seem to you that these things tend?\" The\r\nMagians said: \"If the child is still alive and became king without any\r\narrangement, be thou confident concerning him and have good courage,\r\nfor he shall not be ruler again the second time; since some even of our\r\noracles have had but small results, 131 and that at least which has\r\nto do with dreams comes often in the end to a feeble accomplishment.\"\r\nAstyages made answer in these words: \"I myself also, O Magians, am most\r\ndisposed to believe that this is so, namely that since the boy was named\r\nking the dream has had its fulfilment and that this boy is no longer\r\na source of danger to me. Nevertheless give counsel to me, having well\r\nconsidered what is likely to be most safe both for my house and for\r\nyou.\" Replying to this the Magians said: \"To us also, O king, it is of\r\ngreat consequence that thy rule should stand firm; for in the other\r\ncase it is transferred to strangers, coming round to this boy who is a\r\nPersian, and we being Medes are made slaves and become of no account\r\nin the eyes of the Persians, seeing that we are of different race; but\r\nwhile thou art established as our king, who art one of our own nation,\r\nwe both have our share of rule and receive great honours from thee. Thus\r\nthen we must by all means have a care of thee and of thy rule. And now,\r\nif we saw in this anything to cause fear, we would declare all to thee\r\nbeforehand: but as the dream has had its issue in a trifling manner,\r\nboth we ourselves are of good cheer and we exhort thee to be so\r\nlikewise: and as for this boy, send him away from before thine eyes to\r\nthe Persians and to his parents.\"\r\n\r\n121. When he heard this Astyages rejoiced, and calling Cyrus spoke to\r\nhim thus: \"My son, I did thee wrong by reason of a vision of a dream\r\nwhich has not come to pass, but thou art yet alive by thine own destiny;\r\nnow therefore go in peace to the land of the Persians, and I will send\r\nwith thee men to conduct thee: and when thou art come thither, thou\r\nshalt find a father and a mother not after the fashion of Mitradates the\r\nherdsman and his wife.\"\r\n\r\n122. Thus having spoken Astyages sent Cyrus away; and when he had ed and\r\ncome to the house of Cambyses, his parents received him; and after that,\r\nwhen they learnt who he was, they welcomed him not a little, for they\r\nhad supposed without doubt that their son had perished straightway after\r\nhis birth; and they inquired in what manner he had survived. And he told\r\nthem, saying that before this he had not known but had been utterly in\r\nerror; on the way, however, he had learnt all his own fortunes: for\r\nhe had supposed without doubt that he was the son of the herdsman of\r\nAstyages, but since his journey from the city began he had learnt the\r\nwhole story from those who conducted him. And he said that he had been\r\nbrought up by the wife of the herdsman, and continued to praise her\r\nthroughout, so that Kyno was the chief person in his tale. And his\r\nparents took up this name from him, and in order that their son might\r\nbe thought by the Persians to have been preserved in a more supernatural\r\nmanner, they set on foot a report that Cyrus when he was exposed had\r\nbeen reared by a bitch: 132 and from that source has come this report.\r\n\r\n123. Then as Cyrus grew to be a man, being of all those of his age the\r\nmost courageous and the best beloved, Harpagos sought to become his\r\nfriend and sent him gifts, because he desired to take vengeance on\r\nAstyages. For he saw not how from himself, who was in a private station,\r\npunishment should come upon Astyages; but when he saw Cyrus growing\r\nup, he endeavoured to make him an ally, finding a likeness between the\r\nfortunes of Cyrus and his own. And even before that time he had\r\neffected something: for Astyages being harsh towards the Medes, Harpagos\r\ncommunicated severally with the chief men of the Medes, and persuaded\r\nthem that they must make Cyrus their leader and cause Astyages to cease\r\nfrom being king. When he had effected this and when all was ready, then\r\nHarpagos wishing to make known his design to Cyrus, who lived among the\r\nPersians, could do it no other way, seeing that the roads were watched,\r\nbut devised a scheme as follows:—he made ready a hare, and having cut\r\nopen its belly but without pulling off any of the fur, he put into it,\r\njust as it was, a piece of paper, having written upon it that which\r\nhe thought good; and then he sewed up again the belly of the hare, and\r\ngiving nets as if he were a hunter to that one of his servants whom he\r\ntrusted most, he sent him away to the land of the Persians, enjoining\r\nhim by word of mouth to give the hare to Cyrus, and to tell him at the\r\nsame time to open it with his own hands and let no one else be present\r\nwhen he did so.\r\n\r\n124. This then was accomplished, and Cyrus having received from him the\r\nhare, cut it open; and having found within it the paper he took and read\r\nit over. And the writing said this: \"Son of Cambyses, over thee the gods\r\nkeep guard, for otherwise thou wouldst never have come to so much good\r\nfortune. Do thou therefore 133 take vengeance on Astyages who is thy\r\nmurderer, for so far as his will is concerned thou art dead, but by the\r\ncare of the gods and of me thou art still alive; and this I think thou\r\nhast long ago learnt from first to last, both how it happened about\r\nthyself, and also what things I have suffered from Astyages, because I\r\ndid not slay thee but gave thee to the herdsman. If therefore thou wilt\r\nbe guided by me, thou shalt be ruler of all that land over which now\r\nAstyages is ruler. Persuade the Persians to revolt, and march any army\r\nagainst the Medes: and whether I shall be appointed leader of the army\r\nagainst thee, or any other of the Medes who are in repute, thou hast\r\nwhat thou desirest; for these will be the first to attempt to destroy\r\nAstyages, revolting from him and coming over to thy party. Consider then\r\nthat here at least all is ready, and therefore do this and do it with\r\nspeed.\"\r\n\r\n125. Cyrus having heard this began to consider in what manner he might\r\nmost skilfully persuade the Persians to revolt, and on consideration he\r\nfound that this was the most convenient way, and so in fact he did:—He\r\nwrote first on a paper that which he desired to write, and he made an\r\nassembly of the Persians. Then he unfolded the paper and reading from it\r\nsaid that Astyages appointed him commander of the Persians; \"and now, O\r\nPersians,\" he continued, \"I give you command to come to me each one with\r\na reaping-hook.\" Cyrus then proclaimed this command. (Now there are of\r\nthe Persians many tribes, and some of them Cyrus gathered together and\r\npersuaded to revolt from the Medes, namely those, upon which all the\r\nother Persians depend, the Pasargadai, the Maraphians and the Maspians,\r\nand of these the Pasargadai are the most noble, of whom also the\r\nAchaimenidai are a clan, whence are sprung the Perseïd 134 kings. But\r\nother Persian tribes there are, as follows:—the Panthaliaians, the\r\nDerusiaians and the Germanians, these are all tillers of the soil; and\r\nthe rest are nomad tribes, namely the Daoi, Mardians, Dropicans and\r\nSagartians.)\r\n\r\n126. Now there was a certain region of the Persian land which was\r\novergrown with thorns, extending some eighteen or twenty furlongs in\r\neach direction; and when all had come with that which they had been\r\nbefore commanded to bring, Cyrus bade them clear this region for\r\ncultivation within one day: and when the Persians had achieved the\r\ntask proposed, then he bade them come to him on the next day bathed and\r\nclean. Meanwhile Cyrus, having gathered together in one place all the\r\nflocks of goats and sheep and the herds of cattle belonging to his\r\nfather, slaughtered them and prepared with them to entertain the host\r\nof the Persians, and moreover with wine and other provisions of the most\r\nagreeable kind. So when the Persians came on the next day, he made them\r\nrecline in a meadow and feasted them. And when they had finished dinner,\r\nCyrus asked them whether that which they had on the former day or\r\nthat which they had now seemed to them preferable. They said that the\r\ndifference between them was great, for the former day had for them\r\nnothing but evil, and the present day nothing but good. Taking up this\r\nsaying Cyrus proceeded to lay bare his whole design, saying: \"Men of the\r\nPersians, thus it is with you. If ye will do as I say, ye have these and\r\nten thousand other good things, with no servile labour; but if ye will\r\nnot do as I say, ye have labours like that of yesterday innumerable. Now\r\ntherefore do as I say and make yourselves free: for I seem to myself to\r\nhave been born by providential fortune to take these matters in hand;\r\nand I think that ye are not worse men than the Medes, either in other\r\nmatters or in those which have to do with war. Consider then that this\r\nis so, and make revolt from Astyages forthwith.\"\r\n\r\n127. So the Persians having obtained a leader willingly attempted to set\r\nthemselves free, since they had already for a long time been indignant\r\nto be ruled by the Medes: but when Astyages heard that Cyrus was acting\r\nthus, he sent a messenger and summoned him; and Cyrus bade the messenger\r\nreport to Astyages that he would be with him sooner than he would\r\nhimself desire. So Astyages hearing this armed all the Medes, and\r\nblinded by divine providence he appointed Harpagos to be the leader of\r\nthe army, forgetting what he had done to him. Then when the Medes had\r\nmarched out and began to fight with the Persians, some of them continued\r\nthe battle, namely those who had not been made partakers in the design,\r\nwhile others went over to the Persians; but the greater number were\r\nwilfully slack and fled.\r\n\r\n128. So when the Median army had been shamefully dispersed, so soon as\r\nAstyages heard of it he said, threatening Cyrus: \"But not even so shall\r\nCyrus at least escape punishment.\" Thus having spoken he first impaled\r\nthe Magian interpreters of dreams who had persuaded him to let Cyrus go,\r\nand then he armed those of the Medes, youths and old men, who had been\r\nleft behind in the city. These he led out and having engaged battle with\r\nthe Persians he was worsted, and Astyages himself was taken alive, and\r\nhe lost also those of the Medes whom he had led forth.\r\n\r\n129. Then when Astyages was a prisoner, Harpagos came and stood near him\r\nand rejoiced over him and insulted him; and besides other things which\r\nhe said to grieve him, he asked him especially how it pleased him to\r\nbe a slave instead of a king, making reference to that dinner at which\r\nAstyages had feasted him with the flesh of his own son. 135 He looking\r\nat him asked him in whether he claimed the work of Cyrus as his own\r\ndeed: and Harpagos said that since he had written the letter, the deed\r\nwas justly his. Then Astyages declared him to be at the same time the\r\nmost unskilful and the most unjust of men; the most unskilful because,\r\nwhen it was in his power to become king (as it was, if that which had\r\nnow been done was really brought about by him), he had conferred the\r\nchief power on another, and the most unjust, because on account of that\r\ndinner he had reduced the Medes to slavery. For if he must needs confer\r\nthe kingdom on some other and not keep it himself, it was more just\r\nto give this good thing to one of the Medes rather than to one of the\r\nPersians; whereas now the Medes, who were guiltless of this, had become\r\nslaves instead of masters, and the Persians who formerly were slaves of\r\nthe Medes had now become their masters.\r\n\r\n130. Astyages then, having been king for five-and-thirty years, was thus\r\ncaused to cease from being king; and the Medes stooped under the yoke of\r\nthe Persians because of his cruelty, after they had ruled Asia above the\r\nriver Halys for one hundred and twenty-eight years, except during that\r\nperiod for which the Scythians had rule. 136 Afterwards however it\r\nrepented them that they had done this, and they revolved from Dareios,\r\nand having revolted they were subdued again, being conquered in a\r\nbattle. At this time then, I say, in the reign of Astyages, the Persians\r\nwith Cyrus rose up against the Medes and from that time forth were\r\nrulers of Asia: but as for Astyages, Cyrus did no harm to him besides,\r\nbut kept him with himself until he died. Thus born and bred Cyrus became\r\nking; and after this he subdued Croesus, who was the first to begin the\r\nquarrel, as I have before said; and having subdued him he then became\r\nruler of all Asia.\r\n\r\n131. These are the customs, so far as I know, which the Persians\r\npractise:—Images and temples and altars they do not account it lawful\r\nto erect, nay they even charge with folly those who do these things; and\r\nthis, as it seems to me, because they do not account the gods to be in\r\nthe likeness of men, as do the Hellenes. But it is their wont to perform\r\nsacrifices to Zeus going up to the most lofty of the mountains, and the\r\nwhole circle of the heavens they call Zeus: and they sacrifice to the\r\nSun and the Moon and the Earth, to Fire and to Water and to the Winds:\r\nthese are the only gods to whom they have sacrificed ever from the\r\nfirst; but they have learnt also to sacrifice to Aphrodite Urania,\r\nhaving learnt it both from the Assyrians and the Arabians; and the\r\nAssyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta, the Arabians Alitta, 13601 and the\r\nPersians Mitra.\r\n\r\n132. Now this is the manner of sacrifice for the gods aforesaid which\r\nis established among the Persians:—they make no altars neither do they\r\nkindle fire; and when they mean to sacrifice they use no libation nor\r\nmusic of the pipe nor chaplets 137 nor meal for sprinkling; 138 but when\r\na man wishes to sacrifice to any one of the gods, he leads the animal\r\nfor sacrifice to an unpolluted place and calls upon the god, having\r\nhis tiara 13801 wreathed round generally with a branch of myrtle. For\r\nhimself alone separately the man who sacrifices may not request good\r\nthings in his prayer, but he prays that it may be well with all the\r\nPersians and with the king; for he himself also is included of course\r\nin the whole body of Persians. And when he has cut up the victim into\r\npieces and boiled the flesh, he spreads a layer of the freshest grass\r\nand especially clover, upon which he places forthwith all the pieces of\r\nflesh; and when he has placed them in order, a Magian man stands by them\r\nand chants over them a theogony (for of this nature they say that their\r\nincantation is), seeing that without a Magian it is not lawful for\r\nthem to make sacrifices. Then after waiting a short time the sacrificer\r\ncarries away the flesh and uses it for whatever purpose he pleases.\r\n\r\n133. And of all days their wont is to honour most that on which they\r\nwere born, each one: on this they think it right to set out a feast more\r\nliberal than on other days; and in this feast the wealthier of them set\r\nupon the table an ox or a horse or a camel or an ass, roasted whole in\r\nan oven, and the poor among them set out small animals in the same way.\r\nThey have few solid dishes, 139 but many served up after as dessert, and\r\nthese not in a single course; and for this reason the Persians say that\r\nthe Hellenes leave off dinner hungry, because after dinner they have\r\nnothing worth mentioning served up as dessert, whereas if any\r\ngood dessert were served up they would not stop eating so soon. To\r\nwine-drinking they are very much given, and it is not permitted for\r\na man to vomit or to make water in presence of another. Thus do they\r\nprovide against these things; and they are wont to deliberate when\r\ndrinking hard about the most important of their affairs, and whatsoever\r\nconclusion has pleased them in their deliberation, this on the next day,\r\nwhen they are sober, the master of the house in which they happen to be\r\nwhen they deliberate lays before them for discussion: and if it pleases\r\nthem when they are sober also, they adopt it, but if it does not\r\nplease them, they let it go: and that on which they have had the first\r\ndeliberation when they are sober, they consider again when they are\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\n134. When they meet one another in the roads, by this you may discern\r\nwhether those who meet are of equal rank,—for instead of greeting by\r\nwords they kiss one another on the mouth; but if one of them is a little\r\ninferior to the other, they kiss one another on the cheeks, and if one\r\nis of much less noble rank than the other, he falls down before him and\r\ndoes worship to him. 140 And they honour of all most after themselves\r\nthose nations which dwell nearest to them, and next those which dwell\r\nnext nearest, and so they go on giving honour in proportion to distance;\r\nand they hold least in honour those who dwell furthest off from\r\nthemselves, esteeming themselves to be by far the best of all the human\r\nrace on every point, and thinking that others possess merit according\r\nto the proportion which is here stated, 141 and that those who dwell\r\nfurthest from themselves are the worst. And under the supremacy of the\r\nMedes the various nations used also to govern one another according to\r\nthe same rule as the Persians observe in giving honour, 142 the Medes\r\ngoverning the whole and in particular those who dwelt nearest to\r\nthemselves, and these having rule over those who bordered upon them, and\r\nthose again over the nations that were next to them: for the race went\r\nforward thus ever from government by themselves to government through\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n135. The Persians more than any other men admit foreign usages; for they\r\nboth wear the Median dress judging it to be more comely than their own,\r\nand also for fighting the Egyptian corslet: moreover they adopt all\r\nkinds of luxuries when they hear of them, and in particular they have\r\nlearnt from the Hellenes to have commerce with boys. They marry each\r\none several lawful wives, and they get also a much larger number of\r\nconcubines.\r\n\r\n136. It is established as a sign of manly excellence next after\r\nexcellence in fight, to be able to show many sons; and to those who have\r\nmost the king sends gifts every year: for they consider number to be a\r\nsource of strength. And they educate their children, beginning at five\r\nyears old and going on till twenty, in three things only, in riding, in\r\nshooting, and in speaking the truth: but before the boy is five years\r\nold he does not come into the presence of his father, but lives with the\r\nwomen; and it is so done for this reason, that if the child should die\r\nwhile he is being bred up, he may not be the cause of any grief to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n137. I commend this custom of theirs, and also the one which is next\r\nto be mentioned, namely that neither the king himself shall put any to\r\ndeath for one cause alone, nor any of the other Persians for one cause\r\nalone shall do hurt that is irremediable to any of his own servants; but\r\nif after reckoning he finds that the wrongs done are more in number and\r\ngreater than the services rendered, 143 then only he gives vent to\r\nhis anger. Moreover they say that no one ever killed his own father or\r\nmother, but whatever deeds have been done which seemed to be of this\r\nnature, if examined must necessarily, they say, be found to be due\r\neither to changelings or to children of adulterous birth; for, say they,\r\nit is not reasonable to suppose that the true parent would be killed by\r\nhis own son.\r\n\r\n138. Whatever things it is not lawful for them to do, these it is not\r\nlawful for them even to speak of: and the most disgraceful thing in\r\ntheir estimation is to tell an lie, and next to this to owe money, this\r\nlast for many other reasons, but especially because it is necessary,\r\nthey say, for him who owes money, also sometimes to tell lies: and\r\nwhosoever of the men of the city has leprosy or whiteness of skin, he\r\ndoes not come into a city nor mingle with the other Persians; and they\r\nsay that he has these diseases because he has offended in some way\r\nagainst the Sun: but a stranger who is taken by these diseases, in many\r\nregions 144 they drive out of the country altogether, and also white\r\ndoves, alleging against them the same cause. And into a river they\r\nneither make water nor spit, neither do they wash their hands in it,\r\nnor allow any other to do these things, but they reverence rivers very\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n139. This moreover also has chanced to them, which the Persians have\r\nthemselves failed to notice but I have not failed to do so:—their\r\nnames, which are formed to correspond with their bodily shapes or their\r\nmagnificence of station, end all with the same letter, that letter which\r\nthe Dorians call san and the Ionians sigma; with this you will find, if\r\nyou examine the matter, that all the Persian names end, not some with\r\nthis and others with other letters, but all alike.\r\n\r\n140. So much I am able to say for certain from my own knowledge about\r\nthem: but what follows is reported about their dead as a secret mystery\r\nand not with clearness, namely that the body of a Persian man is not\r\nburied until it has been torn by a bird or a dog. (The Magians I know\r\nfor a certainty have this practice, for they do it openly.) However that\r\nmay be, the Persians cover the body with wax and then bury it in the\r\nearth. Now the Magians are distinguished in many ways from other men,\r\nas also from the priests in Egypt: for these last esteem it a matter\r\nof purity to kill no living creature except the animals which they\r\nsacrifice; but the Magians kill with their own hands all creatures\r\nexcept dogs and men, and they even make this a great end to aim at,\r\nkilling both ants and serpents and all other creeping and flying things.\r\nAbout this custom then be it as it was from the first established; and I\r\nnow to the former narrative. 145\r\n\r\n141. The Ionians and Aiolians, as soon as the Lydians had been subdued\r\nby the Persians, sent messengers to Cyrus at Sardis, desiring to be his\r\nsubjects on the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. And\r\nwhen he heard that which they proposed to him, he spoke to them a fable,\r\nsaying that a certain player on the pipe saw fishes in the sea and\r\nplayed on his pipe, supposing that they would come out to land; but\r\nbeing deceived in his expectation, he took a casting-net and enclosed\r\na great multitude of the fishes and drew them forth from the water: and\r\nwhen he saw them leaping about, he said to the fishes: \"Stop dancing I\r\npray you now, seeing that ye would not come out and dance before when\r\nI piped.\" Cyrus spoke this fable to the Ionians and Aiolians for this\r\nreason, because the Ionians had refused to comply before, when Cyrus\r\nhimself by a messenger requested them to revolt from Croesus, while now\r\nwhen the conquest had been made they were ready to submit to Cyrus. Thus\r\nhe said to them in anger, and the Ionians, when they heard this answer\r\nbrought back to their cities, put walls round about them severally, and\r\ngathered together to the Panionion, all except the men of Miletos, for\r\nwith these alone Cyrus had sworn an agreement on the same terms as the\r\nLydians had granted. The rest of the Ionians resolved by common consent\r\nto send messengers to Sparta, to ask the Spartans to help the Ionians.\r\n\r\n142. These Ionians to whom belongs the Panionion had the fortune to\r\nbuild their cities in the most favourable position for climate and\r\nseasons of any men whom we know: for neither the regions above Ionia nor\r\nthose below, neither those towards the East nor those towards the West,\r\n146 produce the same results as Ionia itself, the regions in the one\r\ndirection being oppressed by cold and moisture, and those in the other\r\nby heat and drought. And these do not use all the same speech, but have\r\nfour different variations of language. 147 First of their cities on the\r\nside of the South lies Miletos, and next to it Myus and Priene. These\r\nare settlements made in Caria, and speak the same language with one\r\nanother; and the following are in Lydia,—Ephesos, Colophon, Lebedos,\r\nTeos, Clazomenai, Phocaia: these cities resemble not at all those\r\nmentioned before in the speech which they use, but they agree one with\r\nanother. There remain besides three Ionian cities, of which two are\r\nestablished in the islands of Samos and Chios, and one is built upon the\r\nmainland, namely Erythrai: now the men of Chios and of Erythrai use the\r\nsame form of language, but the Samians have one for themselves alone.\r\nThus there result four separate forms of language.\r\n\r\n143. Of these Ionians then those of Miletos were sheltered from danger,\r\nsince they had sworn an agreement; and those of them who lived in\r\nislands had no cause for fear, for the Phenicians were not yet subjects\r\nof the Persians and the Persians themselves were not sea-men. Now these\r\n148 were parted off from the other Ionians for no other reason than\r\nthis:—The whole Hellenic nation was at that time weak, but of all its\r\nraces the Ionian was much the weakest and of least account: except\r\nAthens, indeed, it had no considerable city. Now the other Ionians, and\r\namong them the Athenians, avoided the name, not wishing to be called\r\nIonians, nay even now I perceive that the greater number of them are\r\nashamed of the name: but these twelve cities not only prided themselves\r\non the name but established a temple of their own, to which they gave\r\nthe name of Panionion, and they made resolution not to grant a share in\r\nit to any other Ionians (nor indeed did any ask to share it except those\r\nof Smyrna);\r\n\r\n144, just as the Dorians of that district which is now called the Five\r\nCities 149 but was formerly called the Six Cities, 150 take care not\r\nto admit any of the neighbouring Dorians to the temple of Triopion, and\r\neven exclude from sharing in it those of their own body who commit any\r\noffence as regards the temple. For example, in the games of the Triopian\r\nApollo they used formerly to set bronze tripods as prizes for the\r\nvictors, and the rule was that those who received them should not carry\r\nthem out of the temple but dedicate them then and there to the god.\r\nThere was a man then of Halicarnassos, whose name was Agasicles, who\r\nbeing a victor paid no regard to this rule, but carried away the tripod\r\nto his own house and hung it up there upon a nail. On this ground\r\nthe other five cities, Lindos, Ialysos and Cameiros, Cos and Cnidos,\r\nexcluded the sixth city Halicarnassos from sharing in the temple.\r\n\r\n145. Upon these they laid this penalty: but as for the Ionians, I think\r\nthat the reason why they made of themselves twelve cities and would\r\nnot receive any more into their body, was because when they dwelt in\r\nPeloponnesus there were of them twelve divisions, just as now there are\r\ntwelve divisions of the Achaians who drove the Ionians out: for first,\r\n(beginning from the side of Sikyon) comes Pellene, then Aigeira and\r\nAigai, in which last is the river Crathis with a perpetual flow (whence\r\nthe river of the same name in Italy received its name), and Bura and\r\nHelike, to which the Ionians fled for refuge when they were worsted by\r\nthe Achaians in fight, and Aigion and Rhypes and Patreis and Phareis\r\nand Olenos, where is the great river Peiros, and Dyme and Tritaieis, of\r\nwhich the last alone has an inland position. 151 These form now twelve\r\ndivisions of the Achaians, and in former times they were divisions of\r\nthe Ionians.\r\n\r\n146. For this reason then the Ionians also made for themselves twelve\r\ncities; for at any rate to say that these are any more Ionians than\r\nthe other Ionians, or have at all a nobler descent, is mere folly,\r\nconsidering that a large part of them are Abantians from Euboea, who\r\nhave no share even in the name of Ionia, and Minyai of Orchomenos have\r\nbeen mingled with them, and Cadmeians and Dryopians and Phokians who\r\nseceded from their native State and Molossians and Pelasgians of Arcadia\r\nand Dorians of Epidauros and many other races have been mingled with\r\nthem; and those of them who set forth to their settlements from the City\r\nHall of Athens and who esteem themselves the most noble by descent\r\nof the Ionians, these, I say, brought no women with them to their\r\nsettlement, but took Carian women, whose parents they slew: and on\r\naccount of this slaughter these women laid down for themselves a rule,\r\nimposing oaths on one another, and handed it on to their daughters, that\r\nthey should never eat with their husbands, nor should a wife call her\r\nown husband by name, for this reason, because the Ionians had slain\r\ntheir fathers and husbands and children and then having done this had\r\nthem to wife. This happened at Miletos.\r\n\r\n147. Moreover some of them set Lykian kings over them, descendants of\r\nGlaucos and Hippolochos, while others were ruled by Cauconians of Pylos,\r\ndescendants of Codros the son of Melanthos, and others again by princes\r\nof the two races combined. Since however these hold on to the name more\r\nthan the other Ionians, let them be called, if they will, the Ionians of\r\ntruly pure descent; but in fact all are Ionians who have their descent\r\nfrom Athens and who keep the feast of Apaturia; and this all keep except\r\nthe men of Ephesos and Colophon: for these alone of all the Ionians do\r\nnot keep the Apaturia, and that on the ground of some murder committed.\r\n\r\n148. Now the Panionion is a sacred place on the north side of Mycale,\r\nset apart by common agreement of the Ionians for Poseidon of Helike 152;\r\nand this Mycale is a promontory of the mainland running out Westwards\r\ntowards Samos, where the Ionians gathering together from their cities\r\nused to hold a festival which they called the Panionia. (And not only\r\nthe feasts of the Ionians but also those of all the Hellenes equally are\r\nsubject to this rule, that their names all end in the same letter, just\r\nlike the names of the Persians.) 153\r\n\r\nThese then are the Ionian cities:\r\n\r\n149, and those of Aiolia are as follows:—Kyme, which is called\r\nPhriconis, Larisai, Neon-teichos, Temnos, Killa, Notion, Aigiroëssa,\r\nPitane, Aigaiai, Myrina, Gryneia; these are the ancient cities of the\r\nAiolians, eleven in number, since one, Smyrna, was severed from them by\r\nthe Ionians; for these cities, that is those on the mainland, used also\r\nformerly to be twelve in number. And these Aiolians had the fortune to\r\nsettle in a land which is more fertile than that of the Ionians but in\r\nrespect of climate less favoured. 154\r\n\r\n150. Now the Aiolians lost Smyrna in the following manner:—certain men\r\nof Colophon, who had been worsted in party strife and had been driven\r\nfrom their native city, were received there for refuge: and after this\r\nthe Colophonian exiles watched for a time when the men of Smyrna were\r\ncelebrating a festival to Dionysos outside the walls, and then they\r\nclosed the gates against them and got possession of the city. After\r\nthis, when the whole body of Aiolians came to the rescue, they made an\r\nagreement that the Ionians should give up the movable goods, and that\r\non this condition the Aiolians should abandon Smyrna. When the men of\r\nSmyrna had done this, the remaining eleven cities divided them amongst\r\nthemselves and made them their own citizens.\r\n\r\n151. These then are the Aiolian cities upon the mainland, with the\r\nexception of those situated on Mount Ida, for these are separate from\r\nthe rest. And of those which are in the islands, there are five in\r\nLesbos, for the sixth which was situated in Lesbos, namely Arisba, was\r\nenslaved by the men of Methymna, though its citizens were of the same\r\nrace as they; and in Tenedos there is one city, and another in what are\r\ncalled the \"Hundred Isles.\" Now the Lesbians and the men of Tenedos,\r\nlike those Ionians who dwelt in the islands, had no cause for fear; but\r\nthe remaining cities came to a common agreement to follow the Ionians\r\nwhithersoever they should lead.\r\n\r\n152. Now when the messengers from the Ionians and Aiolians came to\r\nSparta (for this business was carried out with speed), they chose before\r\nall others to speak for them the Phocaian, whose name was Pythermos. He\r\nthen put upon him a purple cloak, in order that as many as possible\r\nof the Spartans might hear of it and come together, and having been\r\nintroduced before the assembly 155 he spoke at length, asking the\r\nSpartans to help them. The Lacedemonians however would not listen to\r\nhim, but resolved on the contrary not to help the Ionians. So they\r\ndeparted, and the Lacedemonians, having dismissed the messengers of the\r\nIonians, sent men notwithstanding in a ship of fifty oars, to find out,\r\nas I imagine, about the affairs of Cyrus and about Ionia. These when\r\nthey came to Phocaia sent to Sardis the man of most repute among\r\nthem, whose name was Lacrines, to report to Cyrus the saying of the\r\nLacedemonians, bidding him do hurt to no city of the Hellas, since they\r\nwould not permit it.\r\n\r\n153. When the herald had spoken thus, Cyrus is said to have asked those\r\nof the Hellenes whom he had with him, what men the Lacedemonians were\r\nand how many in number, that they made this proclamation to him; and\r\nhearing their answer he said to the Spartan herald: \"Never yet did I\r\nfear men such as these, who have a place appointed in the midst of their\r\ncity where they gather together and deceive one another by false oaths:\r\nand if I continue in good health, not the misfortunes of the Ionians\r\nwill be for them a subject of talk, but rather their own.\" These words\r\nCyrus threw out scornfully with reference to the Hellenes in general,\r\nbecause they have got for themselves 156 markets and practise buying and\r\nselling there; for the Persians themselves are not wont to use markets\r\nnor have they any market-place at all. After this he entrusted Sardis to\r\nTabalos a Persian, and the gold both of Croesus and of the other Lydians\r\nhe gave to Pactyas a Lydian to take charge of, and himself marched\r\naway to Agbatana, taking with him Croesus and making for the present no\r\naccount of the Ionians. For Babylon stood in his way still, as also the\r\nBactrian nation and the Sacans and the Egyptians; and against these he\r\nmeant to make expeditions himself, while sending some other commander\r\nabout the Ionians.\r\n\r\n154. But when Cyrus had marched away from Sardis, Pactyas caused the\r\nLydians to revolt from Tabalos and from Cyrus. This man went down to the\r\nsea, and having in his possession all the gold that there had been in\r\nSardis, he hired for himself mercenaries and persuaded the men of the\r\nsea-coast to join his expedition. So he marched on Sardis and besieged\r\nTabalos, having shut himself up in the citadel.\r\n\r\n155. Hearing this on his way, Cyrus said to Croesus as follows:\r\n\"Croesus, what end shall I find of these things which are coming to\r\npass? The Lydians will not cease as it seems, from giving trouble to\r\nme and from having it themselves. I doubt me if it were not best 157 to\r\nsell them all as slaves; for as it is, I see that I have done in like\r\nmanner as if one should slay the father and then spare his sons: just so\r\nI took prisoner and am carrying away thee, who wert much more than the\r\nfather of the Lydians, while to the Lydians themselves I delivered up\r\ntheir city; and can I feel surprise after this that they have revolted\r\nfrom me?\" Thus he said what was in his mind, but Croesus answered him as\r\nfollows, fearing lest he should destroy Sardis: \"O king, that which thou\r\nhast said is not without reason; but do not thou altogether give vent\r\nto thy wrath, nor destroy an ancient city which is guiltless both of the\r\nformer things and also of those which have come to pass now: for as\r\nto the former things it was I who did them and I bear the consequences\r\nheaped upon my head; 158 and as for what is now being done, since the\r\nwrongdoer is Pactyas to whom thou didst entrust the charge of Sardis,\r\nlet him pay the penalty. But the Lydians I pray thee pardon, and lay\r\nupon them commands as follows, in order that they may not revolt nor\r\nbe a cause of danger to thee:—send to them and forbid them to possess\r\nweapons of war, but bid them on the other hand put on tunics under their\r\nouter garments and be shod with buskins, and proclaim to them that they\r\ntrain their sons to play the lyre and the harp and to be retail-dealers;\r\nand soon thou shalt see, O king, that they have become women instead of\r\nmen, so that there will be no fear that they will revolt from thee.\"\r\n\r\n156. Croesus, I say, suggested to him this, perceiving that this was\r\nbetter for the Lydians than to be reduced to slavery and sold; for he\r\nknew that if he did not offer a sufficient reason, he would not persuade\r\nCyrus to change his mind, and he feared lest at some future time, if\r\nthey should escape the present danger, the Lydians might revolt from\r\nthe Persians and be destroyed. And Cyrus was greatly pleased with the\r\nsuggestion made and slackened from his wrath, saying that he agreed with\r\nhis advice. Then he called Mazares a Mede, and laid charge upon him to\r\nproclaim to the Lydians that which Croesus suggested, and moreover to\r\nsell into slavery all the rest who had joined with the Lydians in the\r\nexpedition to Sardis, and finally by all means to bring Pactyas himself\r\nalive to Cyrus.\r\n\r\n157. Having given this charge upon the road, he continued his march to\r\nthe native land of the Persians; but Pactyas hearing that an army was\r\napproaching to fight against him was struck with fear and fled away\r\nforthwith to Kyme. Then Mazares the Mede marched upon Sardis with a\r\ncertain portion of the army of Cyrus, and as he did not find Pactyas or\r\nhis followers any longer at Sardis, he first compelled the Lydians to\r\nperform the commands of Cyrus, and by his commands the Lydians changed\r\nthe whole manner of their life. After this Mazares proceeded to send\r\nmessengers to Kyme bidding them give up Pactyas: and the men of Kyme\r\nresolved to refer to the god at Branchidai the question what counsel\r\nthey should follow. For there was there an Oracle established of old\r\ntime, which all the Ionians and Aiolians were wont to consult; and this\r\nplace is in the territory of Miletos above the port of Panormos.\r\n\r\n158. So the men of Kyme sent messengers to the Branchidai 159 to inquire\r\nof the god, and they asked what course they should take about Pactyas so\r\nas to do that which was pleasing to the gods. When they thus inquired,\r\nthe answer was given them that they should deliver up Pactyas to the\r\nPersians: and the men of Kyme, having heard this answer reported, were\r\ndisposed to give him up. Then when the mass of the people were thus\r\ndisposed, Aristodicos the son of Heracleides, a man of repute among the\r\ncitizens, stopped the men of Kyme from doing so, having distrust of the\r\nanswer and thinking that those sent to inquire were not speaking the\r\ntruth; until at last other messengers were sent to the Oracle to ask a\r\nsecond time about Pactyas, and of them Aristodicos was one.\r\n\r\n159. When these came to Branchidai, Aristodicos stood forth from the\r\nrest and consulted the Oracle, asking as follows: Lord, 160 there came\r\nto us a suppliant for protection Pactyas the Lydian, flying from a\r\nviolent death at the hands of the Persians, and they demand him from us,\r\nbidding the men of Kyme give him up. But we, though we fear the power of\r\nthe Persians, yet have not ventured up to this time to deliver to them\r\nthe suppliant, until thy counsel shall be clearly manifested to us,\r\nsaying which of the two things we ought to do.\" He thus inquired, but\r\nthe god again declared to them the same answer, bidding them deliver up\r\nPactyas to the Persians. Upon this Aristodicos with deliberate purpose\r\ndid as follows:—he went all round the temple destroying the nests of the\r\nsparrows 161 and of all the other kinds of birds which had been hatched\r\non the temple: and while he was doing this, it is said that a voice came\r\nfrom the inner shrine directed to Aristodicos and speaking thus: \"Thou\r\nmost impious of men, why dost thou dare to do this? Dost thou carry\r\naway by force from my temple the suppliants for my protection?\" And\r\nAristodicos, it is said, not being at all at a loss replied to this:\r\n\"Lord, dost thou thus come to the assistance of thy suppliants, and yet\r\nbiddest the men of Kyme deliver up theirs?\" and the god answered him\r\nagain thus: \"Yea, I bid you do so, that ye may perish the more quickly\r\nfor your impiety; so that ye may not at any future time come to the\r\nOracle to ask about delivering up of suppliants.\"\r\n\r\n160. When the men of Kyme heard this saying reported, not wishing either\r\nto be destroyed by giving him up or to be besieged by keeping him with\r\nthem, they sent him away to Mytilene. Those of Mytilene however, when\r\nMazares sent messages to them, were preparing to deliver up Pactyas\r\nfor a price, but what the price was I cannot say for certain, since the\r\nbargain was never completed; for the men of Kyme, when they learnt that\r\nthis was being done by the Mytilenians, sent a vessel to Lesbos and\r\nconveyed away Pactyas to Chios. After this he was dragged forcibly from\r\nthe temple of Athene Poliuchos by the Chians and delivered up: and the\r\nChians delivered him up receiving Atarneus in , (now this Atarneus is a\r\nregion of Mysia 162 opposition Lesbos). So the Persians having received\r\nPactyas kept him under guard, meaning to produce him before Cyrus. And\r\na long time elapsed during which none of the Chians either used\r\nbarley-meal grown in this region of Atarneus, for pouring out in\r\nsacrifice to any god, or baked cakes for offering of the corn which grew\r\nthere, but all the produce of this land was excluded from every kind of\r\nsacred service.\r\n\r\n161. The men of Chios had then delivered up Pactyas; and after this\r\nMazares made expedition against those who had joined in besieging\r\nTabalos: and first he reduced to slavery those of Priene, then he\r\noverran the whole plain of the Maiander making spoil of it for his army,\r\nand Magnesia in the same manner: and straightway after this he fell sick\r\nand died.\r\n\r\n162. After he was dead, Harpagos came down to take his place in command,\r\nbeing also a Mede by race (this was the man whom the king of the Medes\r\nAstyages feasted with the unlawful banquet, and who helped to give the\r\nkingdom to Cyrus). This man, being appointed commander then by Cyrus,\r\ncame to Ionia and proceeded to take the cities by throwing up mounds\r\nagainst them: for when he had enclosed any people within their walls,\r\nthen he threw up mounds against the walls and took their city by storm;\r\nand the first city of Ionia upon which he made an attempt was Phocaia.\r\n\r\n163. Now these Phocaians were the first of the Hellenes who made long\r\nvoyages, and these are they who discovered the Adriatic and Tyrsenia and\r\nIberia and Tartessos: and they made voyages not in round ships, but in\r\nvessels of fifty oars. These came to Tartessos and became friends with\r\nthe king of the Tartessians whose name was Arganthonios: he was ruler\r\nof the Tartessians for eighty years and lived in all one hundred and\r\ntwenty. With this man, I say, the Phocaians became so exceedingly\r\nfriendly, that first he bade them leave Ionia and dwell wherever they\r\ndesired in his own land; and as he did not prevail upon the Phocaians\r\nto do this, afterwards, hearing from them of the Mede how his power was\r\nincreasing, he gave them money to build a wall about their city: and he\r\ndid this without sparing, for the circuit of the wall is many furlongs\r\n163 in extent, and it is built all of large stones closely fitted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n164. The wall of the Phocaians was made in this manner: and Harpagos\r\nhaving marched his army against them began to besiege them, at the same\r\ntime holding forth to them proposals and saying that it was enough to\r\nsatisfy him if the Phocaians were willing to throw down one battlement\r\nof their wall and dedicate one single house. 164 But the Phocaians,\r\nbeing very greatly grieved at the thought of subjection, said that they\r\nwished to deliberate about the matter for one day and after that they\r\nwould give their answer; and they asked him to withdraw his army from\r\nthe wall while they were deliberating. Harpagos said that he knew very\r\nwell what they were meaning to do, nevertheless he was willing to allow\r\nthem to deliberate. So in the time that followed, when Harpagos\r\nhad withdrawn his army from the wall, the Phocaians drew down their\r\nfifty-oared galleys to the sea, put into them their children and women\r\nand all their movable goods, and besides them the images out of the\r\ntemples and the other votive offerings except such as were made of\r\nbronze or stone or consisted of paintings, all the rest, I say, they\r\nput into the ships, and having embarked themselves they sailed towards\r\nChios; and the Persians obtained possession of Phocaia, the city being\r\ndeserted of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n165. But as for the Phocaians, since the men of Chios would not sell\r\nthem at their request the islands called Oinussai, from the fear lest\r\nthese islands might be made a seat of trade and their island might be\r\nshut out, therefore they set out for Kyrnos: 165 for in Kyrnos\r\ntwenty years before this they had established a city named Alalia, in\r\naccordance with an oracle, (now Arganthonios by that time was dead). And\r\nwhen they were setting out for Kyrnos they first sailed to Phocaia and\r\nslaughtered the Persian garrison, to whose charge Harpagos had\r\ndelivered the city; then after they had achieved this they made solemn\r\nimprecations on any one of them who should be left behind from their\r\nvoyage, and moreover they sank a mass of iron in the sea and swore that\r\nnot until that mass should appear again on the surface 166 would they to\r\nPhocaia. However as they were setting forth to Kyrnos, more than half of\r\nthe citizens were seized with yearning and regret for their city and for\r\ntheir native land, and they proved false to their oath and sailed back\r\nto Phocaia. But those of them who kept the oath still, weighed anchor\r\nfrom the islands of Oinussai and sailed.\r\n\r\n166. When these came to Kyrnos, for five years they dwelt together with\r\nthose who had come thither before, and they founded temples there.\r\nThen, since they plundered the property of all their neighbours,\r\nthe Tyrsenians and Carthaginians 167 made expedition against them by\r\nagreement with one another, each with sixty ships. And the Phocaians\r\nalso manned their vessels, sixty in number, and came to meet the enemy\r\nin that which is called the Sardinian sea: and when they encountered one\r\nanother in the sea-fight the Phocaians won a kind of Cadmean victory,\r\nfor forty of their ships were destroyed and the remaining twenty were\r\ndisabled, having had their prows bent aside. So they sailed in to Alalia\r\nand took up their children and their women and their other possessions\r\nas much as their ships proved capable of carrying, and then they left\r\nKyrnos behind them and sailed to Rhegion.\r\n\r\n167. But as for the crews of the ships that were destroyed, the\r\nCarthaginians and Tyrsenians obtained much the greater number of them,\r\n168 and these they brought to land and killed by stoning. After this the\r\nmen of Agylla found that everything which passed by the spot where the\r\nPhocaians were laid after being stoned, became either distorted, or\r\ncrippled, or paralysed, both small cattle and beasts of burden and\r\nhuman creatures: so the men of Agylla sent to Delphi desiring to purge\r\nthemselves of the offence; and the Pythian prophetess bade them do that\r\nwhich the men of Agylla still continue to perform, that is to say, they\r\nmake great sacrifices in honour of the dead, and hold at the place a\r\ncontest of athletics and horse-racing. These then of the Phocaians had\r\nthe fate which I have said; but those of them who took refuge at Rhegion\r\nstarted from thence and took possession of that city in the land of\r\nOinotria which now is called Hyele. This they founded having learnt from\r\na man of Poseidonia that the Pythian prophetess by her answer meant\r\nthem to found a temple to Kyrnos, who was a hero, and not to found a\r\nsettlement in the island of Kyrnos. 169\r\n\r\n168. About Phocaia in Ionia it happened thus, and nearly the same thing\r\nalso was done by the men of Teos: for as soon as Harpagos took their\r\nwall with a mound, they embarked in their ships and sailed straightway\r\nfor Thrace; and there they founded the city of Abdera, which before\r\nthem Timesios of Clazomenai founded and had no profit therefrom, but\r\nwas driven out by the Thracians; and now he is honoured as a hero by the\r\nTeïans in Abdera.\r\n\r\n169. These alone of all the Ionians left their native cities because\r\nthey would not endure subjection: but the other Ionians except the\r\nMilesians did indeed contend in arms with Harpagos like those who left\r\ntheir homes, and proved themselves brave men, fighting each for his own\r\nnative city; but when they were defeated and captured they remained all\r\nin their own place and performed that which was laid upon them: but the\r\nMilesians, as I have also said before, had made a sworn agreement with\r\nCyrus himself and kept still. Thus for the second time Ionia had been\r\nreduced to subjection. And when Harpagos had conquered the Ionians on\r\nthe mainland, then the Ionians who dwelt in the islands, being struck\r\nwith fear by these things, gave themselves over to Cyrus.\r\n\r\n170. When the Ionians had been thus evilly entreated but were continuing\r\nstill to hold their gatherings as before at the Panionion, Bias a man\r\nof Priene set forth to the Ionians, as I am informed, a most profitable\r\ncounsel, by following which they might have been the most prosperous\r\nof all the Hellenes. He urged that the Ionians should set forth in one\r\ncommon expedition and sail to Sardinia, and after that found a single\r\ncity for all the Ionians: and thus they would escape subjection and\r\nwould be prosperous, inhabiting the largest of all islands and being\r\nrulers over others; whereas, if they remained in Ionia, he did not\r\nperceive, he said, that freedom would any longer exist for them. This\r\nwas the counsel given by Bias of Priene after the Ionians had been\r\nruined; but a good counsel too was given before the ruin of Ionia\r\nby Thales a man of Miletos, who was by descent of Phenician race. He\r\nadvised the Ionians to have one single seat of government, 170 and that\r\nthis should be at Teos (for Teos, he said, was in the centre of Ionia),\r\nand that the other cities should be inhabited as before, but accounted\r\njust as if they were demes.\r\n\r\nThese men 171 set forth to them counsels of the kind which I have said:\r\n\r\n171. but Harpagos, after subduing Ionia, proceeded to march against the\r\nCarians and Caunians and Lykians, taking also Ionians and Aiolians to\r\nhelp him. Of these the Carians came to the mainland from the islands;\r\nfor being of old time subjects of Minos and being called Leleges, they\r\nused to dwell in the islands, paying no tribute, so far back as I am\r\nable to arrive by hearsay, but whenever Minos required it, they used\r\nto supply his ships with seamen: and as Minos subdued much land and was\r\nfortunate in his fighting, the Carian nation was of all nations by much\r\nthe most famous at that time together with him. And they produced three\r\ninventions of which the Hellenes adopted the use; that is to say, the\r\nCarians were those who first set the fashion of fastening crests on\r\nhelmets, and of making the devices which are put onto shields, and these\r\nalso were the first who made handles for their shields, whereas up to\r\nthat time all who were wont to use shields carried them without handles\r\nand with leathern straps to guide them, having them hung about their\r\nnecks and their left shoulders. Then after the lapse of a long time the\r\nDorians and Ionians drove the Carians out of the islands, and so they\r\ncame to the mainland. With respect to the Carians the Cretans relate\r\nthat it happened thus; the Carians themselves however do not agree with\r\nthis account, but suppose that they are dwellers on the mainland from\r\nthe beginning, 172 and that they went always by the same name which they\r\nhave now: and they point as evidence of this to an ancient temple of\r\nCarian Zeus at Mylasa, in which the Mysians and Lydians share as being\r\nbrother races of the Carians, for they say that Lydos and Mysos were\r\nbrothers of Car; these share in it, but those who being of another race\r\nhave come to speak the same language as the Carians, these have no share\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n172. It seems to me however that the Caunians are dwellers there from\r\nthe beginning, though they say themselves that they came from Crete: but\r\nthey have been assimilated to the Carian race in language, or else the\r\nCarians to the Caunian race, I cannot with certainty determine which.\r\nThey have customs however in which they differ very much from all other\r\nmen as well as from the Carians; for example the fairest thing in their\r\nestimation is to meet together in numbers for drinking, according to\r\nequality of age or friendship, both men, women, and children; and again\r\nwhen they had founded temples for foreign deities, afterwards they\r\nchanged their purpose and resolved to worship only their own native\r\ngods, and the whole body of Caunian young men put on their armour and\r\nmade pursuit as far as the borders of the Calyndians, beating the air\r\nwith their spears; and they said that they were casting the foreign gods\r\nout of the land. Such are the customs which these have.\r\n\r\n173. The Lykians however have sprung originally from Crete (for in old\r\ntime the whole of Crete was possessed by Barbarians): and when the sons\r\nof Europa, Sarpedon and Minos, came to be at variance in Crete about the\r\nkingdom, Minos having got the better in the strife of parties drove\r\nout both Sarpedon himself and those of his party: and they having been\r\nexpelled came to the land of Milyas in Asia, for the land which now the\r\nLykians inhabit was anciently called Milyas, and the Milyans were then\r\ncalled Solymoi. Now while Sarpedon reigned over them, they were called\r\nby the name which they had when they came thither, and by which the\r\nLykians are even now called by the neighbouring tribes, namely Termilai;\r\nbut when from Athens Lycos the son of Pandion came to the land of the\r\nTermilai and to Sarpedon, he too having been driven out by his brother\r\nnamely Aigeus, then by the name taken from Lycos they were called after\r\na time Lykians. The customs which these have are partly Cretan and\r\npartly Carian; but one custom they have which is peculiar to them, and\r\nin which they agree with no other people, that is they call themselves\r\nby their mothers and not by their fathers; and if one asks his neighbour\r\nwho he is, he will state his parentage on the mother's side and\r\nenumerate his mother's female ascendants: and if a woman who is a\r\ncitizen marry a slave, the children are accounted to be of gentle birth;\r\nbut if a man who is a citizen, though he were the first man among them,\r\nhave a slave for wife or concubine, the children are without civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n174. Now the Carians were reduced to subjection by Harpagos without any\r\nbrilliant deed displayed either by the Carians themselves or by those\r\nof the Hellenes who dwell in this land. Of these last there are besides\r\nothers the men of Cnidos, settlers from Lacedemon, whose land runs out\r\ninto the sea, 173 being in fact the region which is called Triopion,\r\nbeginning from the peninsula of Bybassos: and since all the land of\r\nCnidos except a small part is washed by the sea (for the part of it\r\nwhich looks towards the North is bounded by the Gulf of Keramos, and\r\nthat which looks to the South by the sea off Syme and Rhodes), therefore\r\nthe men of Cnidos began to dig through this small part, which is about\r\nfive furlongs across, while Harpagos was subduing Ionia, desiring to\r\nmake their land an island: and within the isthmus all was theirs, 174\r\nfor where the territory of Cnidos ends in the direction of the mainland,\r\nhere is the isthmus which they were digging across. And while the\r\nCnidians were working at it with a great number of men, it was perceived\r\nthat the men who worked suffered injury much more than might have been\r\nexpected and in a more supernatural manner, both in other parts of their\r\nbodies and especially in their eyes, when the rock was being broken\r\nup; so they sent men to ask the Oracle at Delphi what the cause of\r\nthe difficulty was. And the Pythian prophetess, as the men of Cnidos\r\nthemselves report, gave them this reply in trimeter verse:—\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Fence not the place with towers, nor dig the isthmus through;\r\n  Zeus would have made your land an island, had he willed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Pythian prophetess had given this oracle, the men of Cnidos\r\nnot only ceased from their digging but delivered themselves to Harpagos\r\nwithout resistance, when he came against them with his army.\r\n\r\n175. There were also the Pedasians, who dwelt in the inland country\r\nabove Halicarnassos; and among these, whenever anything hurtful is about\r\nto happen either to themselves or to their neighbours, the priestess\r\nof Athene has a great beard: this befell them three times. These of\r\nall about Caria were the only men who held out for any time against\r\nHarpagos, and they gave him trouble more than any other people, having\r\nfortified a mountain called Lide.\r\n\r\n176. After a time the Pedasians were conquered; and the Lykians, when\r\nHarpagos marched his army into the plain of Xanthos, came out against\r\nhim 175 and fought, few against many, and displayed proofs of valour;\r\nbut being defeated and confined within their city, they gathered\r\ntogether into the citadel their wives and their children, their property\r\nand their servants, and after that they set fire to this citadel, so\r\nthat it was all in flames, and having done so and sworn terrible oaths\r\nwith one another, they went forth against the enemy 176 and were slain\r\nin fight, that is to say all the men of Xanthos: and of the Xanthians\r\nwho now claim to be Lykians the greater number have come in from abroad,\r\nexcept only eighty households; but these eighty households happened\r\nat that time to be away from their native place, and so they escaped\r\ndestruction. Thus Harpagos obtained possession of Caunos, for the men of\r\nCaunos imitated in most respects the behaviour of the Lykians.\r\n\r\n177. So Harpagos was conquering the coast regions of Asia; and Cyrus\r\nhimself meanwhile was doing the same in the upper parts of it, subduing\r\nevery nation and passing over none. Now most of these actions I shall\r\npass over in silence, but the undertakings which gave him trouble more\r\nthan the rest and which are the most worthy of note, of these I shall\r\nmake mention.\r\n\r\n178. Cyrus, so soon as he had made subject to himself all other parts\r\nof the mainland, proceeded to attack the Assyrians. Now Assyria\r\nhas doubtless many other great cities, but the most famous and the\r\nstrongest, and the place where the seat of their monarchy had been\r\nestablished after Nineveh was destroyed, was Babylon; which was a city\r\nsuch as I shall say.—It lies in a great plain, and in size it is such\r\nthat each face measures one hundred and twenty furlongs, 177 the shape\r\nof the whole being square; thus the furlongs of the circuit of the city\r\namount in all to four hundred and eighty. Such is the size of the city\r\nof Babylon, and it had a magnificence greater than all other cities of\r\nwhich we have knowledge. First there runs round it a trench deep and\r\nbroad and full of water; then a wall fifty royal cubits in thickness\r\nand two hundred cubits in height: now the royal cubit is larger by three\r\nfingers than the common cubit. 178\r\n\r\n179. I must also tell in addition to this for what purpose the earth was\r\nused, which was taken out of the trench, and in what manner the wall was\r\nmade. As they dug the trench they made the earth which was carried out\r\nof the excavation into bricks, and having moulded enough bricks they\r\nbaked them in kilns; and then afterwards, using hot asphalt for mortar\r\nand inserting reed mats at every thirty courses of brickwork, they built\r\nup first the edges of the trench and then the wall itself in the same\r\nmanner: and at the top of the wall along the edges they built chambers\r\nof one story facing one another; and between the rows of chambers they\r\nleft space to drive a four-horse chariot. In the circuit of the wall\r\nthere are set a hundred gates made of bronze throughout, and the\r\ngate-posts and lintels likewise. Now there is another city distant from\r\nBabylon a space of eight days' journey, of which the name is Is; and\r\nthere is a river there of no great size, and the name of the river is\r\nalso Is, and it sends its stream into the river Euphrates. This river Is\r\nthrows up together with its water lumps of asphalt in great abundance,\r\nand thence was brought the asphalt for the wall of Babylon.\r\n\r\n180. Babylon then was walled in this manner; and there are two divisions\r\nof the city; for a river whose name is Euphrates parts it in the middle.\r\nThis flows from the land of the Armenians and is large and deep and\r\nswift, and it flows out into the Erythraian sea. The wall then on each\r\nside has its bends 179 carried down to the river, and from this point\r\nthe walls stretch along each bank of the stream in the form of a rampart\r\nof baked bricks: and the city itself is full of houses of three and\r\nfour stories, and the roads by which it is cut up run in straight lines,\r\nincluding the cross roads which lead to the river; and opposite to each\r\nroad there were set gates in the rampart which ran along the river, in\r\nmany in number as the ways, 180 and these also were of bronze and led\r\nlike the ways 181 to the river itself.\r\n\r\n181. This wall then which I have mentioned is as it were a cuirass 182\r\nfor the town, and another wall runs round within it, not much weaker for\r\ndefence than the first but enclosing a smaller space. 183 And in each\r\ndivision of the city was a building in the midst, in the one the king's\r\npalace of great extent and strongly fortified round, and in the other\r\nthe temple of Zeus Belos with bronze gates, and this exists still up to\r\nmy time and measures two furlongs each way, 184 being of a square shape:\r\nand in the midst of the temple 185 is built a solid tower measuring a\r\nfurlong both in length and in breadth, and on this tower another tower\r\nhas been erected, and another again upon this, and so on up to the\r\nnumber of eight towers. An ascent to these has been built running\r\noutside round about all the towers; and when one reaches about the\r\nmiddle of the ascent one finds a stopping-place and seats to rest upon,\r\non which those who ascend sit down and rest: and on the top of the last\r\ntower there is a large cell, 186 and in the cell a large couch is laid,\r\nwell covered, and by it is placed a golden table: and there is no image\r\nthere set up nor does any human being spend the night there except only\r\none woman of the natives of the place, whomsoever the god shall choose\r\nfrom all the woman, as say the Chaldeans who are the priests of this\r\ngod.\r\n\r\n182. These same men say also, but I do not believe them, that the god\r\nhimself comes often to the cell and rests upon the couch, as happens\r\nlikewise in the Egyptian Thebes according to the report of the\r\nEgyptians, for there also a woman sleeps in the temple of the Theban\r\nZeus (and both these women are said to abstain from commerce with men),\r\nand as happens also with the prophetess 187 of the god in Patara of\r\nLykia, whenever there is one, for there is not always an Oracle there,\r\nbut whenever there is one, then she is shut up during the nights in the\r\ntemple within the cell.\r\n\r\n183. There is moreover in the temple at Babylon another cell below,\r\nwherein is a great image of Zeus sitting, made of gold, and by it is\r\nplaced a large table of gold, and his footstool and seat are of gold\r\nalso; and, as the Chaldeans reported, the weight of the gold of which\r\nthese things are made is eight hundred talents. Outside this cell is\r\nan altar of gold; and there is also another altar of great size, where\r\nfull-grown animals 188 are sacrificed, whereas on the golden altar it\r\nis not lawful to sacrifice any but young sucklings only: and also on the\r\nlarger altar the Chaldeans offer one thousand talents of frankincense\r\nevery year at the time when they celebrate the feast in honour of this\r\ngod. There was moreover in these precincts still remaining at the time\r\nof Cyrus, 189 a statue twelve cubits high, of gold and solid. This I\r\ndid not myself see, but that which is related by the Chaldeans I relate.\r\nAgainst this statue Dareios the son of Hystaspes formed a design, but\r\nhe did not venture to take it: it was taken however by Xerxes the son of\r\nDareios, who also killed the priest when he forbade him to meddle with\r\nthe statue. This temple, then, is thus adorned with magnificence, and\r\nthere are also many private votive-offerings.\r\n\r\n184. Of this Babylon, besides many other rulers, of whom I shall make\r\nmention in the Assyrian history, and who added improvement to the walls\r\nand temples, there were also two who were women. Of these, the one who\r\nruled first, named Semiramis, who lived five generations before the\r\nother, produced banks of earth in the plain which are a sight worth\r\nseeing; and before this the river used to flood like a sea over the\r\nwhole plain.\r\n\r\n185. The queen who lived after her time, named Nitocris, was wiser than\r\nshe who had reigned before; and in the first place she left behind her\r\nmonuments which I shall tell of; then secondly, seeing that the monarchy\r\nof the Medes was great and not apt to remain still, but that besides\r\nother cities even Nineveh had been captured by it, she made provision\r\nagainst it in so far as she was able. First, as regards the river\r\nEuphrates which flows through the midst of their city, whereas before\r\nthis it flowed straight, she by digging channels above made it so\r\nwinding that it actually comes three times in its course to one of the\r\nvillages in Assyria; and the name of the village to which the Euphrates\r\ncomes is Ardericca; and at this day those who travel from this Sea of\r\nours to Babylon, in their voyage down the river Euphrates 18901 arrive\r\nthree times at this same village and on three separate days. This she\r\ndid thus; and she also piled up a mound along each bank of the river,\r\nwhich is worthy to cause wonder for its size and height: and at a great\r\ndistance above Babylon, she dug a basin for a lake, which she caused to\r\nextend along at a very small distance from the river, 190 excavating it\r\neverywhere of such depth as to come to water, and making the extent such\r\nthat the circuit of it measured four hundred and twenty furlongs: and\r\nthe earth which was dug out of this excavation she used up by piling it\r\nin mounds along the banks of the river: and when this had been dug by\r\nher she brought stones and set them all round it as a facing wall. Both\r\nthese two things she did, that is she made the river to have a winding\r\ncourse, and she made the place which was dug out all into a swamp, in\r\norder that the river might run more slowly, having its force broken\r\nby going round many bends, and that the voyages might be winding to\r\nBabylon, and after the voyages there might succeed a long circuit of the\r\npool. These works she carried out in that part where the entrance to the\r\ncountry was, and the shortest way to it from Media, so that the Medes\r\nmight not have dealings with her kingdom and learn of her affairs.\r\n\r\n186. These defences she cast round her city from the depth; and she made\r\nthe following addition which was dependent upon them:—The city was in\r\ntwo divisions, and the river occupied the space between; and in the\r\ntime of the former rulers, when any one wished to pass over from the\r\none division to the other, he had to pass over in a boat, and that, as I\r\nimagine, was troublesome: she however made provision also for this; for\r\nwhen she was digging the basin for the lake she left this other monument\r\nof herself derived from the same work, that is, she caused stones to be\r\ncut of very great length, and when the stones were prepared for her and\r\nthe place had been dug out, she turned aside the whole stream of the\r\nriver into the place which she had been digging; and while this was\r\nbeing filled with water, the ancient bed of the river being dried up in\r\nthe meantime, she both built up with baked bricks after the same fashion\r\nas the wall the edges of the river, where it flows through the city, and\r\nthe places of descent leading from the small gateways to the river; and\r\nalso about the middle of the city, as I judge, with the stones which\r\nshe had caused to be dug out she proceeded to build a bridge, binding\r\ntogether the stones with iron and lead: and upon the top she laid\r\nsquared timbers across, to remain there while it was daytime, over which\r\nthe people of Babylon made the passage across; but at night they used to\r\ntake away these timbers for this reason, namely that they might not go\r\nbackwards and forwards by night and steal from one another: and when the\r\nplace dug out had been made into a lake full of water by the river, and\r\nat the same time the bridge had been completed, then she conducted the\r\nEuphrates back into its ancient channel from the lake, and so the\r\nplace dug out being made into a swamp was thought to have served a good\r\npurpose, and there had been a bridge set up for the men of the city.\r\n\r\n187. This same queen also contrived a snare of the following kind:—Over\r\nthat gate of the city through which the greatest number of people passed\r\nshe set up for herself a tomb above the very gate itself. And on the\r\ntomb she engraved writing which said thus: \"If any of the kings of\r\nBabylon who come after me shall be in want of wealth, let him open my\r\ntomb and take as much as he desires; but let him not open it for any\r\nother cause, if he be not in want; for that will not be well.\" 191 This\r\ntomb was undisturbed until the kingdom came to Dareios; but to Dareios\r\nit seemed that it was a monstrous thing not to make any use of this\r\ngate, and also, when there was money lying there, not to take it,\r\nconsidering that the money itself invited him to do so. Now the reason\r\nwhy he would not make any use of this gate was because the corpse would\r\nhave been above his head as he drove through. He then, I say, opened the\r\ntomb and found not indeed money but the corpse, with writing which said\r\nthus: \"If thou hadst not been insatiable of wealth and basely covetous,\r\nthou wouldest not have opened the resting-places of the dead.\"\r\n\r\n188. This queen then is reported to have been such as I have described:\r\nand it was the son of this woman, bearing the same name as his father,\r\nLabynetos, and being ruler over the Assyrians, against whom Cyrus was\r\nmarching. Now the great king makes his marches not only well furnished\r\n192 from home with provisions for his table and with cattle, but also\r\ntaking with him water from the river Choaspes, which flows by Susa, of\r\nwhich alone and of no other river the king drinks: and of this water of\r\nthe Choaspes boiled, a very great number of waggons, four-wheeled\r\nand drawn by mules, carry a supply in silver vessels, and go with him\r\nwherever he may march at any time.\r\n\r\n189. Now when Cyrus on his way towards Babylon arrived at the river\r\nGyndes,—of which river the springs are in the mountains of the\r\nMatienians, and it flows through the Dardanians and runs into another\r\nriver, the Tigris, which flowing by the city of Opis runs out into the\r\nErythraian Sea,—when Cyrus, I say, was endeavouring to cross this river\r\nGyndes, which is a navigable stream, then one of his sacred white horses\r\nin high spirit and wantonness went into the river and endeavoured to\r\ncross, but the stream swept it under water and carried it off forthwith.\r\nAnd Cyrus was greatly moved with anger against the river for having done\r\nthus insolently, and he threatened to make it so feeble that for the\r\nfuture even women could cross it easily without wetting the knee. So\r\nafter this threat he ceased from his march against Babylon and divided\r\nhis army into two parts; and having divided it he stretched lines and\r\nmarked out straight channels, 193 one hundred and eighty on each bank of\r\nthe Gyndes, directed every way, and having disposed his army along them\r\nhe commanded them to dig: so, as a great multitude was working, the work\r\nwas completed indeed, but they spent the whole summer season at this\r\nspot working.\r\n\r\n190. When Cyrus had taken vengeance on the river Gyndes by dividing it\r\ninto three hundred and sixty channels, and when the next spring was just\r\nbeginning, then at length he continued his advance upon Babylon: and\r\nthe men of Babylon had marched forth out of their city and were awaiting\r\nhim. So when in his advance he came near to the city, the Babylonians\r\njoined battle with him, and having been worsted in the fight they were\r\nshut up close within their city. But knowing well even before this that\r\nCyrus was not apt to remain still, and seeing him lay hands on every\r\nnation equally, they had brought in provisions beforehand 194 for very\r\nmany years. So while these made no account of the siege, Cyrus was\r\nin straits what to do, for much time went by and his affairs made no\r\nprogress onwards.\r\n\r\n191. Therefore, whether it was some other man who suggested it to him\r\nwhen he was in a strait what to do, or whether he of himself perceived\r\nwhat he ought to do, he did as follows:—The main body of his army 195 he\r\nposted at the place where the river runs into the city, and then again\r\nbehind the city he set others, where the river issues forth from the\r\ncity; and he proclaimed to his army that so soon as they should see that\r\nthe stream had become passable, they should enter by this way into the\r\ncity. Having thus set them in their places and in this manner exhorted\r\nthem he marched away himself with that part of his army which was not\r\nfit for fighting: and when he came to the lake, Cyrus also did the same\r\nthings which the queen of the Babylonians had done as regards the river\r\nand the lake; that is to say, he conducted the river by a channel into\r\nthe lake, which was at that time a swamp, and so made the former course\r\nof the river passable by the sinking of the stream. When this had been\r\ndone in such a manner, the Persians who had been posted for this very\r\npurpose entered by the bed of the river Euphrates into Babylon, the\r\nstream having sunk so far that it reached about to the middle of a man's\r\nthigh. Now if the Babylonians had had knowledge of it beforehand or had\r\nperceived that which was being done by Cyrus, they would have allowed\r\n196 the Persians to enter the city and then destroyed them miserably;\r\nfor if they had closed all the gates that led to the river and mounted\r\nthemselves upon the ramparts which were carried along the banks of the\r\nstream, they would have caught them as it were in a fish-wheal: but as\r\nit was, the Persians came upon them unexpectedly; and owing to the size\r\nof the city (so it is said by those who dwell there) after those about\r\nthe extremities of the city had suffered capture, those Babylonians who\r\ndwelt in the middle did not know that they had been captured; but\r\nas they chanced to be holding a festival, they went on dancing and\r\nrejoicing during this time until they learnt the truth only too well.\r\n\r\nBabylon then had thus been taken for the first time:\r\n\r\n192, and as to the resources of the Babylonians how great they are, I\r\nshall show by many other proofs and among them also by this:—For the\r\nsupport of the great king and his army, apart from the regular tribute\r\nthe whole land of which he is ruler has been distributed into portions.\r\nNow whereas twelve months go to make up the year, for four of these he\r\nhas his support from the territory of Babylon, and for the remaining\r\neight months from the whole of the rest of Asia; thus the Assyrian\r\nland is in regard to resources the third part of all Asia: and the\r\ngovernment, or satrapy as it is called by the Persians, of this\r\nterritory is of all the governments by far the best; seeing that when\r\nTritantaichmes son of Artabazos had this province from the king, there\r\ncame in to him every day an artab full of silver coin (now the artab\r\nis a Persian measure and holds more than the medimnos of Attica 197 by\r\nthree Attic choinikes); and of horses he had in this province as his\r\nprivate property, apart from the horses for use in war, eight hundred\r\nstallions and sixteen thousand mares, for each of these stallions served\r\ntwenty mares: of Indian hounds moreover such a vast number were\r\nkept that four large villages in the plain, being free from other\r\ncontributions, had been appointed to provide food for the hounds.\r\n\r\n193. Such was the wealth which belonged to the ruler of Babylon. Now\r\nthe land of the Assyrians has but little rain; and this little gives\r\nnourishment to the root of the corn, but the crop is ripened and the ear\r\ncomes on by the help of watering from the river, not as in Egypt by the\r\ncoming up of the river itself over the fields, but the crop is watered\r\nby hand or with swing-buckets. For the whole Babylonian territory like\r\nthe Egyptian is cut up into channels, and the largest of the channels is\r\nnavigable for ships and runs in the direction of the sunrising in winter\r\nfrom the Euphrates to another river, namely the Tigris, along the bank\r\nof which lay the city of Nineveh. This territory is of all that we know\r\nthe best by far for producing corn: 198 as to trees, 199 it does\r\nnot even attempt to bear them, either fig or vine or olive, but for\r\nproducing corn it is so good that it s as much as two-hundred-fold\r\nfor the average, and when it bears at its best it produces\r\nthree-hundred-fold. The leaves of the wheat and barley there grow to\r\nbe full four fingers broad; and from millet and sesame seed how large\r\na tree grows, I know myself but shall not record, being well aware that\r\neven what has already been said relating to the crops produced has been\r\nenough to cause disbelief in those who have not visited the Babylonian\r\nland. They use no oil of olives, but only that which they make of sesame\r\nseed; and they have date-palms growing over all the plain, most of them\r\nfruit-bearing, of which they make both solid food and wine and honey;\r\nand to these they attend in the same manner as to fig-trees, and in\r\nparticular they take the fruit of those palms which the Hellenes call\r\nmale-palms, and tie them upon the date-bearing palms, so that their\r\ngall-fly may enter into the date and ripen it and that the fruit of\r\nthe palm may not fall off: for the male-palm produces gall-flies in its\r\nfruit just as the wild-fig does.\r\n\r\n194. But the greatest marvel of all the things in the land after the\r\ncity itself, to my mind is this which I am about to tell: Their boats,\r\nthose I mean which go down the river to Babylon, are round and all of\r\nleather: for they make ribs for them of willow which they cut in the\r\nland of the Armenians who dwell above the Assyrians, and round these\r\nthey stretch hides which serve as a covering outside by way of hull, not\r\nmaking broad the stern nor gathering in the prow to a point, but making\r\nthe boats round like a shield: and after that they stow the whole boat\r\nwith straw and suffer it to be carried down the stream full of cargo;\r\nand for the most part these boats bring down casks of palm-wood 200\r\nfilled with wine. The boat is kept straight by two steering-oars and\r\ntwo men standing upright, and the man inside pulls his oar while the man\r\noutside pushes. 201 These vessels are made both of very large size and\r\nalso smaller, the largest of them having a burden of as much as five\r\nthousand talents' weight; 202 and in each one there is a live ass, and\r\nin those of larger size several. So when they have arrived at Babylon in\r\ntheir voyage and have disposed of their cargo, they sell by auction the\r\nribs of the boat and all the straw, but they pack the hides upon their\r\nasses and drive them off to Armenia: for up the stream of the river\r\nit is not possible by any means to sail, owing to the swiftness of the\r\ncurrent; and for this reason they make their boats not of timber but\r\nof hides. Then when they have come back to the land of the Armenians,\r\ndriving their asses with them, they make other boats in the same manner.\r\n\r\n195. Such are their boats; and the following is the manner of dress\r\nwhich they use, namely a linen tunic reaching to the feet, and over this\r\nthey put on another of wool, and then a white mantle thrown round, while\r\nthey have shoes of a native fashion rather like the Boeotian slippers.\r\nThey wear their hair long and bind their heads round with fillets, 203\r\nand they are anointed over the whole of their body with perfumes. Each\r\nman has a seal and a staff carved by hand, and on each staff is carved\r\neither an apple or a rose or a lily or an eagle or some other device,\r\nfor it is not their custom to have a staff without a device upon it.\r\n\r\n196. Such is the equipment of their bodies: and the customs which are\r\nestablished among them are as follows, the wisest in our opinion being\r\nthis, which I am informed that the Enetoi in Illyria also have. In every\r\nvillage once in each year it was done as follows:—When the maidens\r\n204 grew to the age for marriage, they gathered these all together and\r\nbrought them in a body to one place, and round them stood a company of\r\nmen: and the crier caused each one severally to stand up, and proceeded\r\nto sell them, first the most comely of all, and afterwards, when she had\r\nbeen sold and had fetched a large sum of money, he would put up another\r\nwho was the most comely after her: and they were sold for marriage. Now\r\nall the wealthy men of the Babylonians who were ready to marry vied with\r\none another in bidding for the most beautiful maidens; those however of\r\nthe common sort who were ready to marry did not require a fine form, but\r\nthey would accept money together with less comely maidens. For when the\r\ncrier had made an end of selling the most comely of the maidens, then\r\nhe would cause to stand up that one who was least shapely, or any one of\r\nthem who might be crippled in any way, and he would make proclamation\r\nof her, asking who was willing for least gold to have her in marriage,\r\nuntil she was assigned to him who was willing to accept least: and the\r\ngold would be got from the sale of the comely maidens, and so those\r\nof beautiful form provided dowries for those which were unshapely or\r\ncrippled; but to give in marriage one's own daughter to whomsoever each\r\nman would, was not allowed, nor to carry off the maiden after buying her\r\nwithout a surety; for it was necessary for the man to provide sureties\r\nthat he would marry her, before he took her away; and if they did not\r\nagree well together, the law was laid down that he should pay back\r\nthe money. It was allowed also for any one who wished it to come from\r\nanother village and buy. This then was their most honourable custom; it\r\ndoes not however still exist at the present time, but they have found\r\nout of late another way, in order that the men may not ill-treat them or\r\ntake them to another city: 205 for since the time when being conquered\r\nthey were oppressed and ruined, each one of the common people when he is\r\nin want of livelihood prostitutes his female children.\r\n\r\n197. Next in wisdom to that, is this other custom which was established\r\n206 among them:—they bear out the sick into the market-place; for of\r\nphysicians they make no use. So people come up to the sick man and give\r\nadvice about his disease, if any one himself has ever suffered anything\r\nlike that which the sick man has, or saw any other who had suffered\r\nit; and coming near they advise and recommend those means by which they\r\nthemselves got rid of a like disease or seen some other get rid of it:\r\nand to pass by the sick man in silence is not permitted to them, nor\r\nuntil one has asked what disease he has.\r\n\r\n198. They bury their dead in honey, and their modes of lamentation\r\nare similar to those used in Egypt. And whenever a Babylonian man has\r\nintercourse with his wife, he sits by incense offered, and his wife does\r\nthe same on the other side, and when it is morning they wash themselves,\r\nboth of them, for they will touch no vessel until they have washed\r\nthemselves: and the Arabians do likewise in this matter.\r\n\r\n199. Now the most shameful of the customs of the Babylonians is as\r\nfollows: every woman of the country must sit down in the precincts 207\r\nof Aphrodite once in her life and have commerce with a man who is a\r\nstranger: and many women who do not deign to mingle with the rest,\r\nbecause they are made arrogant by wealth, drive to the temple with pairs\r\nof horses in covered carriages, and so take their place, and a large\r\nnumber of attendants follow after them; but the greater number do\r\nthus,—in the sacred enclosure of Aphrodite sit great numbers of women\r\nwith a wreath of cord about their heads; some come and others go; and\r\nthere are passages in straight lines going between the women in every\r\ndirection, 208 through which the strangers pass by and make their\r\nchoice. Here when a woman takes her seat she does not depart again to\r\nher house until one of the strangers has thrown a silver coin into her\r\nlap and has had commerce with her outside the temple, and after throwing\r\nit he must say these words only: \"I demand thee in the name of the\r\ngoddess Mylitta\": 209 now Mylitta is the name given by the Assyrians to\r\nAphrodite: and the silver coin may be of any value; whatever it is she\r\nwill not refuse it, for that is not lawful for her, seeing that this\r\ncoin is made sacred by the act: and she follows the man who has first\r\nthrown and does not reject any: and after that she departs to her house,\r\nhaving acquitted herself of her duty to the goddess 210, nor will you\r\nbe able thenceforth to give any gift so great as to win her. So then as\r\nmany as have attained to beauty and stature 211 are speedily released,\r\nbut those of them who are unshapely remain there much time, not being\r\nable to fulfil the law; for some of them remain even as much as three or\r\nfour years: and in some parts of Cyprus too there is a custom similar to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n200. These customs then are established among the Babylonians: and there\r\nare of them three tribes 212 which eat nothing but fish only: and when\r\nthey have caught them and dried them in the sun they do thus,—they\r\nthrow them into brine, and then pound them with pestles and strain them\r\nthrough muslin; and they have them for food either kneaded into a soft\r\ncake, or baked like bread, according to their liking.\r\n\r\n201. When this nation also had been subdued by Cyrus, he had a desire to\r\nbring the Massagetai into subjection to himself. This nation is reputed\r\nto be both great and warlike, and to dwell towards the East and the\r\nsunrising, beyond the river Araxes and over against 213 the Issedonians:\r\nand some also say that this nation is of Scythian race.\r\n\r\n202. Now the Araxes is said by some to be larger and by others to be\r\nsmaller than the Ister: and they say that there are many islands in it\r\nabout equal in size to Lesbos, and in them people dwelling who feed in\r\nthe summer upon roots of all kinds which they dig up and certain fruits\r\nfrom trees, which have been discovered by them for food, they store up,\r\nit is said, in the season when they are ripe and feed upon them in the\r\nwinter. Moreover it is said that other trees have been discovered by\r\nthem which yield fruit of such a kind that when they have assembled\r\ntogether in companies in the same place and lighted a fire, they sit\r\nround in a circle and throw some of it into the fire, and they smell the\r\nfruit which is thrown on, as it burns, and are intoxicated by the scent\r\nas the Hellenes are with wine, and when more of the fruit is thrown on\r\nthey become more intoxicated, until at last they rise up to dance and\r\nbegin to sing. This is said to be their manner of living: and as to the\r\nriver Araxes, it flows from the land of the Matienians, whence flows the\r\nGyndes which Cyrus divided into the three hundred and sixty channels,\r\nand it discharges itself by forty branches, of which all except one end\r\nin swamps and shallow pools; and among them they say that men dwell who\r\nfeed on fish eaten raw, and who are wont to use as clothing the skins of\r\nseals: but the one remaining branch of the Araxes flows with unimpeded\r\ncourse into the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n203. Now the Caspian Sea is apart by itself, not having connection with\r\nthe other Sea: for all that Sea which the Hellenes navigate, and the Sea\r\nbeyond the Pillars, which is called Atlantis, and the Erythraian Sea are\r\nin fact all one, but the Caspian is separate and lies apart by itself.\r\nIn length it is a voyage of fifteen days if one uses oars, 214 and\r\nin breadth, where it is broadest, a voyage of eight days. On the side\r\ntowards the West of this Sea the Caucasus runs along by it, which is of\r\nall mountain-ranges both the greatest in extent and the loftiest: and\r\nthe Caucasus has many various races of men dwelling in it, living for\r\nthe most part on the wild produce of the forests; and among them\r\nthere are said to be trees which produce leaves of such a kind that by\r\npounding them and mixing water with them they paint figures upon their\r\ngarments, and the figures do not wash out, but grow old with the woollen\r\nstuff as if they had been woven into it at the first: and men say that\r\nthe sexual intercourse of these people is open like that of cattle.\r\n\r\n204. On the West then of this Sea which is called Caspian the Caucasus\r\nis the boundary, while towards the East and the rising sun a plain\r\nsucceeds which is of limitless extent to the view. Of this great plain\r\nthen the Massagetai occupy a large part, against whom Cyrus had become\r\neager to march; for there were many strong reasons which incited him to\r\nit and urged him onwards,—first the manner of his birth, that is to say\r\nthe opinion held of him that he was more than a mere mortal man,\r\nand next the success which he had met with 215 in his wars, for\r\nwhithersoever Cyrus directed his march, it was impossible for that\r\nnation to escape.\r\n\r\n205. Now the ruler of the Massagetai was a woman, who was queen after\r\nthe death of her husband, and her name was Tomyris. To her Cyrus sent\r\nand wooed her, pretending that he desired to have her for his wife:\r\nbut Tomyris understanding that he was wooing not herself but rather\r\nthe kingdom of the Massagetai, rejected his approaches: and Cyrus\r\nafter this, as he made no progress by craft, marched to the Araxes, and\r\nproceeded to make an expedition openly against the Massagetai, forming\r\nbridges of boats over the river for his army to cross, and building\r\ntowers upon the vessels which gave them passage across the river.\r\n\r\n206. While he was busied about this labour, Tomyris sent a herald and\r\nsaid thus: \"O king of the Medes, cease to press forward the work which\r\nthou art now pressing forward; for thou canst not tell whether these\r\nthings will be in the end for thy advantage or no; cease to do so, I\r\nsay, and be king over thine own people, and endure to see us ruling\r\nthose whom we rule. Since however I know that thou wilt not be willing\r\nto receive this counsel, but dost choose anything rather than to be\r\nat rest, therefore if thou art greatly anxious to make trial of the\r\nMassagetai in fight, come now, leave that labour which thou hast in\r\nyoking together the banks of the river, and cross over into our land,\r\nwhen we have first withdrawn three days' journey from the river: or if\r\nthou desirest rather to receive us into your land, do thou this same\r\nthing thyself.\" Having heard this Cyrus called together the first men\r\namong the Persians, and having gathered these together he laid the\r\nmatter before them for discussion, asking their advice as to which\r\nof the two things he should do: and their opinions all agreed in one,\r\nbidding him receive Tomyris and her army into his country.\r\n\r\n207. But Croesus the Lydian, being present and finding fault with this\r\nopinion, declared an opinion opposite to that which had been set forth,\r\nsaying as follows: \"O king, I told thee in former time also, that since\r\nZeus had given me over to thee, I would avert according to my power\r\nwhatever occasion of falling I might see coming near thy house: and now\r\nmy sufferings, which have been bitter, 216 have proved to be lessons of\r\nwisdom to me. If thou dost suppose that thou art immortal and that thou\r\ndost command an army which is also immortal, it will be of no use for me\r\nto declare to thee my judgment; but if thou hast perceived that thou art\r\na mortal man thyself and dost command others who are so likewise, then\r\nlearn this first, that for the affairs of men there is a revolving\r\nwheel, and that this in its revolution suffers not the same persons\r\nalways to have good fortune. I therefore now have an opinion about the\r\nmatter laid before us, which is opposite to that of these men: for if we\r\nshall consent to receive the enemy into our land, there is for thee this\r\ndanger in so doing:—if thou shalt be worsted thou wilt lose in addition\r\nall thy realm, for it is evident that if the Massagetai are victors they\r\nwill not turn back and fly, but will march upon the provinces of thy\r\nrealm; and on the other hand if thou shalt be the victor, thou wilt not\r\nbe victor so fully as if thou shouldest overcome the Massagetai after\r\ncrossing over into their land and shouldest pursue them when they fled.\r\nFor against that which I said before I will set the same again here, and\r\nsay that thou, when thou hast conquered, wilt march straight against\r\nthe realm of Tomyris. Moreover besides that which has been said, it is\r\na disgrace and not to be endured that Cyrus the son of Cambyses should\r\nyield to a woman and so withdraw from her land. Now therefore it seems\r\ngood to me that we should cross over and go forward from the crossing as\r\nfar as they go in their retreat, and endeavour to get the better of\r\nthem by doing as follows:—The Massagetai, as I am informed, are without\r\nexperience of Persian good things, and have never enjoyed any great\r\nluxuries. Cut up therefore cattle without stint and dress the meat\r\nand set out for these men a banquet in our camp: moreover also provide\r\nwithout stint bowls of unmixed wine and provisions of every kind; and\r\nhaving so done, leave behind the most worthless part of thy army and let\r\nthe rest begin to retreat from the camp towards the river: for if I\r\nam not mistaken in my judgment, they when they see a quantity of good\r\nthings will fall to the feast, and after that it remains for us to\r\ndisplay great deeds.\"\r\n\r\n208. These were the conflicting opinions; and Cyrus, letting go the\r\nformer opinion and choosing that of Croesus, gave notice to Tomyris to\r\nretire, as he was intending to cross over to her. She then proceeded to\r\nretire, as she had at first engaged to do, but Cyrus delivered Croesus\r\ninto the hands of his son Cambyses, to whom he meant to give the\r\nkingdom, and gave him charge earnestly to honour him and to treat him\r\nwell, if the crossing over to go against the Massagetai should not be\r\nprosperous. Having thus charged him and sent these away to the land of\r\nthe Persians, he crossed over the river both himself and his army.\r\n\r\n209. And when he had passed over the Araxes, night having come on he saw\r\na vision in his sleep in the land of the Massagetai, as follows:—in his\r\nsleep it seemed to Cyrus that he saw the eldest of the sons of Hystaspes\r\nhaving upon his shoulders wings, and that with the one of these he\r\novershadowed Asia and with the other Europe. Now of Hystaspes the son\r\nof Arsames, who was a man of the Achaimenid clan, the eldest son was\r\nDareios, who was then, I suppose, a youth of about twenty years of age,\r\nand he had been left behind in the land of the Persians, for he was\r\nnot yet of full age to go out to the wars. So then when Cyrus awoke he\r\nconsidered with himself concerning the vision: and as the vision seemed\r\nto him to be of great import, he called Hystaspes, and having taken him\r\napart by himself he said: \"Hystaspes, thy son has been found plotting\r\nagainst me and against my throne: and how I know this for certain I will\r\ndeclare to thee:—The gods have a care of me and show me beforehand all\r\nthe evils that threaten me. So in the night that is past while sleeping\r\nI saw the eldest of thy sons having upon his shoulders wings, and with\r\nthe one of these he overshadowed Asia and with the other Europe. To\r\njudge by this vision then, it cannot be but that he is plotting against\r\nme. Do thou therefore go by the quickest way back to Persia and take\r\ncare that, when I thither after having subdued these regions, thou set\r\nthy son before me to be examined.\"\r\n\r\n210. Cyrus said thus supposing that Dareios was plotting against him;\r\nbut in fact the divine powers were showing him beforehand that he was\r\ndestined to find his end there and that his kingdom was coming about\r\nto Dareios. To this then Hystaspes replied as follows: \"O king, heaven\r\nforbid 217 that there should be any man of Persian race who would plot\r\nagainst thee, and if there be any, I pray that he perish as quickly as\r\nmay be; seeing that thou didst make the Persians to be free instead of\r\nslaves, and to rule all nations instead of being ruled by others. And if\r\nany vision announces to thee that my son is planning rebellion against\r\nthee, I deliver him over to thee to do with him whatsoever thou wilt.\"\r\n\r\n211. Hystaspes then, having made answer with these words and having\r\ncrossed over the Araxes, was going his way to the Persian land to keep\r\nwatch over his son Dareios for Cyrus; and Cyrus meanwhile went forward\r\nand made a march of one day from the Araxes according to the suggestion\r\nof Croesus. After this when Cyrus and the best part of the army 218 of\r\nthe Persians had marched back to the Araxes, and those who were unfit\r\nfor fighting had been left behind, then a third part of the army of\r\nthe Massagetai came to the attack and proceeded to slay, not without\r\nresistance, 219 those who were left behind of the army of Cyrus; and\r\nseeing the feast that was set forth, when they had overcome their\r\nenemies they lay down and feasted, and being satiated with food and wine\r\nthey went to sleep. Then the Persians came upon them and slew many of\r\nthem, and took alive many more even than they slew, and among these the\r\nson of the queen Tomyris, who was leading the army of the Massagetai;\r\nand his name was Spargapises.\r\n\r\n212. She then, when she heard that which had come to pass concerning the\r\narmy and also the things concerning her son, sent a herald to Cyrus and\r\nsaid as follows: \"Cyrus, insatiable of blood, be not elated with pride\r\nby this which has come to pass, namely because with that fruit of the\r\nvine, with which ye fill yourselves and become so mad that as the wine\r\ndescends into your bodies, evil words float up upon its stream,—because\r\nsetting a snare, I say, with such a drug as this thou didst overcome my\r\nson, and not by valour in fight. Now therefore receive the word which\r\nI utter, giving thee good advice:—Restore to me my son and depart from\r\nthis land without penalty, triumphant over a third part of the army of\r\nthe Massagetai: but if thou shalt not do so, I swear to thee by the Sun,\r\nwho is lord of the Massagetai, that surely I will give thee thy fill of\r\nblood, insatiable as thou art.\"\r\n\r\n213. When these words were reported to him Cyrus made no account of\r\nthem; and the son of the queen Tomyris, Spargapises, when the wine left\r\nhim and he learnt in what evil case he was, entreated Cyrus that he\r\nmight be loosed from his chains and gained his request, and then so\r\nsoon as he was loosed and had got power over his hands he put himself to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n214. He then ended his life in this manner; but Tomyris, as Cyrus did\r\nnot listen to her, gathered together all her power and joined battle\r\nwith Cyrus. This battle of all the battles fought by Barbarians I\r\njudge to have been the fiercest, and I am informed that it happened\r\nthus:—first, it is said, they stood apart and shot at one another, and\r\nafterwards when their arrows were all shot away, they fell upon one\r\nanother and engaged in close combat with their spears and daggers; and\r\nso they continued to be in conflict with one another for a long time,\r\nand neither side would flee; but at last the Massagetai got the better\r\nin the fight: and the greater part of the Persian army was destroyed\r\nthere on the spot, and Cyrus himself brought his life to an end there,\r\nafter he had reigned in all thirty years wanting one. Then Tomyris\r\nfilled a skin with human blood and had search made among the Persian\r\ndead for the corpse of Cyrus: and when she found it, she let his head\r\ndown into the skin and doing outrage to the corpse she said at the\r\nsame time this: \"Though I yet live and have overcome thee in fight,\r\nnevertheless thou didst undo me by taking my son with craft: but I\r\naccording to my threat will give thee thy fill of blood.\" Now as regards\r\nthe end of the life of Cyrus there are many tales told, but this which I\r\nhave related is to my mind the most worthy of belief.\r\n\r\n215. As to the Massagetai, they wear a dress which is similar to that of\r\nthe Scythians, and they have a manner of life which is also like theirs;\r\nand there are of them horsemen and also men who do not ride on horses\r\n(for they have both fashions), and moreover there are both archers\r\nand spearmen, and their custom it is to carry battle-axes; 220 and for\r\neverything they use either gold or bronze, for in all that has to do\r\nwith spear-points or arrow-heads or battle-axes they use bronze, but for\r\nhead-dresses and girdles and belts round the arm-pits 221 they employ\r\ngold as ornament: and in like manner as regards their horses, they put\r\nbreast-plates of bronze about their chests, but on their bridles and\r\nbits and cheek-pieces they employ gold. Iron however and silver they use\r\nnot at all, for they have them not in their land, but gold and bronze in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n216. These are the customs which they have:—Each marries a wife, but\r\nthey have their wives in common; for that which the Hellenes say that\r\nthe Scythians do, is not in fact done by the Scythians but by the\r\nMassagetai, that is to say, whatever woman a man of the Massagetai may\r\ndesire he hangs up his quiver in front of the waggon and has commerce\r\nwith her freely. They have no precise limit of age laid down for their\r\nlife, but when a man becomes very old, his nearest of kin come together\r\nand slaughter him solemnly 222 and cattle also with him; and then after\r\nthat they boil the flesh and banquet upon it. This is considered by them\r\nthe happiest lot; but him who has ended his life by disease they do not\r\neat, but cover him up in the earth, counting it a misfortune that he did\r\nnot attain to being slaughtered. They sow no crops but live on cattle\r\nand on fish, which last they get in abundance from the river Araxes;\r\nmoreover they are drinkers of milk. Of gods they reverence the Sun\r\nalone, and to him they sacrifice horses: and the rule 223 of the\r\nsacrifice is this:—to the swiftest of the gods they assign the swiftest\r\nof all mortal things.\r\n\r\n—————\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK I\r\n\r\n1 [ {'Erodotou 'Alikarnesseos istories apodexis ede, os k.t.l.} The\r\nmeaning of the word {istorie} passes gradually from \"research\" or\r\n\"inquiry\" to \"narrative,\" \"history\"; cp. vii. 96.

THE SECOND BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED EUTERPE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When Cyrus had brought his life to an end, Cambyses received the\r\nroyal power in succession, being the son of Cyrus and of Cassandane the\r\ndaughter of Pharnaspes, for whose death, which came about before his\r\nown, Cyrus had made great mourning himself and also had proclaimed to\r\nall those over whom he bore rule that they should make mourning for her:\r\nCambyses, I say, being the son of this woman and of Cyrus, regarded\r\nthe Ionians and Aiolians as slaves inherited from his father; and he\r\nproceeded to march an army against Egypt, taking with him as helpers not\r\nonly the other nations of which he was the ruler, but also those of the\r\nHellenes over whom he had power besides.\r\n\r\n2. Now the Egyptians, before the time when Psammetichos 1 became king\r\nover them, were wont to suppose that they had come into being first of\r\nall men; but since the time when Psammetichos having become king desired\r\nto know what men had come into being first, they suppose that the\r\nPhrygians came into being before themselves, but they themselves before\r\nall other men. Now Psammetichos, when he was not able by inquiry to\r\nfind out any means of knowing who had come into being first of all men,\r\ncontrived a device of the following kind:—Taking two new-born children\r\nbelonging to persons of the common sort he gave them to a shepherd to\r\nbring up at the place where his flocks were, with a manner of bringing\r\nup such as I shall say, charging him namely that no man should utter any\r\nword in their presence, and that they should be placed by themselves in\r\na room where none might come, and at the proper time he should bring to\r\nthem she-goats, and when he had satisfied them with milk he should do\r\nfor them whatever else was needed. These things Psammetichos did and\r\ngave him this charge wishing to hear what word the children would let\r\nbreak forth first, after they had ceased from wailings without sense.\r\nAnd accordingly so it came to pass; for after a space of two years had\r\ngone by, during which the shepherd went on acting so, at length, when\r\nhe opened the door and entered, both the children fell before him in\r\nentreaty and uttered the word bekos, stretching forth their hands. At\r\nfirst when he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word\r\nwas often repeated, as he visited them constantly and attended to them,\r\nat last he declared the matter to his master, and at his command he\r\nbrought the children before his face. Then Psammetichos having himself\r\nalso heard it, began to inquire about what nation of men named anything\r\nbekos, and inquiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for\r\nbread. In this manner and guided by an indication such as this, the\r\nEgyptians were brought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient\r\npeople than themselves.\r\n\r\n3. That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that Hephaistos\r\nwho dwells at Memphis; 2 but the Hellenes relate, besides many other\r\nidle tales, that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women, and\r\nthen caused the children to live with these women.\r\n\r\nWith regard then to the rearing of the children they related so much as\r\nI have said: and I heard also other things at Memphis when I had speech\r\nwith the priests of Hephaistos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and\r\nHeliopolis 3 for this very cause, namely because I wished to know\r\nwhether the priests at these places would agree in their accounts with\r\nthose at Memphis; for the men of Heliopolis are said to be the most\r\nlearned in records of the Egyptians. Those of their narrations which I\r\nheard with regard to the gods I am not earnest to relate in full, but\r\nI shall name them only, 4 because I consider that all men are equally\r\nignorant of these matters: 5 and whatever things of them I may record, I\r\nshall record only because I am compelled by the course of the story.\r\n\r\n4. But as to those matters which concern men, the priests agreed with\r\none another in saying that the Egyptians were the first of all men on\r\nearth to find out the course of the year, having divided the seasons\r\ninto twelve parts to make up the whole; and this they said they found\r\nout from the stars: and they reckon to this extent more wisely than\r\nthe Hellenes, as it seems to me, inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an\r\nintercalated month every other year, to make the seasons right, whereas\r\nthe Egyptians, reckoning the twelve months at thirty days each, bring\r\nin also every year five days beyond the number, and thus the circle of\r\ntheir seasons is completed and comes round to the same point whence\r\nit set out. They said moreover that the Egyptians were the first who\r\nbrought into use appellations for the twelve gods and the Hellenes took\r\nup the use from them; and that they were the first who assigned altars\r\nand images and temples to the gods, and who engraved figures on stones;\r\nand with regard to the greater number of these things they showed me by\r\nactual facts that they had happened so. They said also that the first\r\nman 6 who became king of Egypt was Min; 7 and that in his time all Egypt\r\nexcept the district of Thebes 8 was a swamp, and none of the regions\r\nwere then above water which now lie below the lake of Moiris, to which\r\nlake it is a voyage of seven days up the river from the sea:\r\n\r\n5, and I thought that they said well about the land; for it is manifest\r\nin truth even to a person who has not heard it beforehand but has only\r\nseen, at least if he have understanding, that the Egypt to which the\r\nHellenes come in ships is a land which has been won by the Egyptians as\r\nan addition, and that it is a gift of the river: moreover the regions\r\nwhich lie above this lake also for a distance of three days' sail, about\r\nwhich they did not go on to say anything of this kind, are nevertheless\r\nanother instance of the same thing: for the nature of the land of Egypt\r\nis as follows:—First when you are still approaching it in a ship and are\r\ndistant a day's run from the land, if you let down a sounding-line you\r\nwill bring up mud and will find yourself in eleven fathoms. This then so\r\nfar shows that there is a silting forward of the land.\r\n\r\n6. Then secondly, as to Egypt itself, the extent of it along the sea is\r\nsixty schoines, according to our definition of Egypt as extending from\r\nthe Gulf of Plinthine to the Serbonian lake, along which stretches Mount\r\nCasion; from this lake then 9 the sixty schoines are reckoned: for those\r\nof men who are poor in land have their country measured by fathoms,\r\nthose who are less poor by furlongs, those who have much land by\r\nparasangs, and those who have land in very great abundance by schoines:\r\nnow the parasang is equal to thirty furlongs, and each schoine, which\r\nis an Egyptian measure, is equal to sixty furlongs. So there would be\r\nan extent of three thousand six hundred furlongs for the coast-land of\r\nEgypt. 10\r\n\r\n7. From thence and as far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad, and the\r\nland is all flat and without springs of water 11 and formed of mud: and\r\nthe road as one goes inland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the\r\nsame in length as that which leads from the altar of the twelve gods at\r\nAthens to Pisa and the temple of Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would\r\nfind the difference very small by which these roads fail of being equal\r\nin length, not more indeed than fifteen furlongs; for the road from\r\nAthens to Pisa wants fifteen furlongs of being fifteen hundred, while\r\nthe road to Heliopolis from the sea reaches that number completely.\r\n\r\n8. From Heliopolis however, as you go up, Egypt is narrow; for on the\r\none side a mountain-range belonging to Arabia stretches along by the\r\nside of it, going in a direction from North towards the midday and the\r\nSouth Wind, tending upwards without a break to that which is called the\r\nErythraian Sea, in which range are the stone-quarries which were used\r\nin cutting stone for the pyramids at Memphis. On this side then the\r\nmountain ends where I have said, and then takes a turn back; 12 and\r\nwhere it is widest, as I was informed, it is a journey of two months\r\nacross from East to West; and the borders of it which turn towards the\r\nEast are said to produce frankincense. Such then is the nature of this\r\nmountain-range; and on the side of Egypt towards Libya another range\r\nextends, rocky and enveloped in sand: in this are the pyramids, and it\r\nruns in the same direction as those parts of the Arabian mountains which\r\ngo towards the midday. So then, I say, from Heliopolis the land has no\r\nlonger a great extent so far as it belongs to Egypt, 13 and for about\r\nfour 14 days' sail up the river Egypt properly so called is narrow:\r\nand the space between the mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is\r\nplain-land, but where it is narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed\r\ntwo hundred furlongs from the Arabian mountains to those which are\r\ncalled the Libyan. After this again Egypt is broad.\r\n\r\n9. Such is the nature of this land: and from Heliopolis to Thebes is\r\na voyage up the river of nine days, and the distance of the journey in\r\nfurlongs is four thousand eight hundred and sixty, the number of the\r\nschoines being eighty-one. If these measures of Egypt in furlongs be put\r\ntogether the result is as follows:—I have already before this shown\r\nthat the distance along the sea amounts to three thousand six hundred\r\nfurlongs, and I will now declare what the distance is inland from the\r\nsea to Thebes, namely six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs: and\r\nagain the distance from Thebes to the city called Elephantine is one\r\nthousand eight hundred furlongs.\r\n\r\n10. Of this land then, concerning which I have spoken, it seemed to\r\nmyself also, according as the priests said, that the greater part had\r\nbeen won as an addition by the Egyptians; for it was evident to me that\r\nthe space between the aforesaid mountain-ranges, which lie above the\r\ncity of Memphis, once was a gulf of the sea, like the regions about\r\nIlion and Teuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander, if it\r\nbe permitted to compare small things with great; and small these are in\r\ncomparison, for of the rivers which heaped up the soil in those regions\r\nnone is worthy to be compared in volume with a single one of the mouths\r\nof the Nile, which has five mouths. 15 Moreover there are other rivers\r\nalso, not in size at all equal to the Nile, which have performed great\r\nfeats; of which I can mention the names of several, and especially the\r\nAcheloös, which flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out into the\r\nsea has already made half of the Echinades from islands into mainland.\r\n\r\n11. Now there is in the land of Arabia, not far from Egypt, a gulf of\r\nthe sea running in from that which is called the Erythraian Sea, very\r\nlong and narrow, as I am about to tell. With respect to the length of\r\nthe voyage along it, one who set out from the innermost point to sail\r\nout through it into the open sea, would spend forty days upon the\r\nvoyage, using oars; 16 and with respect to breadth, where the gulf is\r\nbroadest it is half a day's sail across: and there is in it an ebb and\r\nflow of tide every day. Just such another gulf I suppose that Egypt was,\r\nand that the one ran in towards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea, and the\r\nother, the Arabian, of which I am about to speak, 17 tended from the\r\nSouth towards Syria, the gulfs boring in so as almost to meet at their\r\nextreme points, and passing by one another with but a small space left\r\nbetween. If then the stream of the Nile should turn aside into this\r\nArabian gulf, what would hinder that gulf from being filled up with silt\r\nas the river continued to flow, at all events within a period of twenty\r\nthousand years? indeed for my part I am of opinion that it would be\r\nfilled up even within ten thousand years. How, then, in 18 all the time\r\nthat has elapsed before I came into being should not a gulf be filled up\r\neven of much greater size than this by a river so great and so active?\r\n\r\n12. As regards Egypt then, I both believe those who say that things\r\nare so, and for myself also I am strongly of opinion that they are so;\r\nbecause I have observed that Egypt runs out into the sea further than\r\nthe adjoining land, and that shells are found upon the mountains of it,\r\nand an efflorescence of salt forms upon the surface, so that even\r\nthe pyramids are being eaten away by it, and moreover that of all the\r\nmountains of Egypt, the range which lies above Memphis is the only one\r\nwhich has sand: besides which I notice that Egypt resembles neither the\r\nland of Arabia, which borders upon it, nor Libya, nor yet Syria (for\r\nthey are Syrians who dwell in the parts of Arabia lying along the sea),\r\nbut that it has soil which is black and easily breaks up, 19 seeing that\r\nit is in truth mud and silt brought down from Ethiopia by the river: but\r\nthe soil of Libya, we know, is reddish in colour and rather sandy, while\r\nthat of Arabia and Syria is somewhat clayey and rocky. 1901\r\n\r\n13. The priests also gave me a strong proof concerning this land as\r\nfollows, namely that in the reign of king Moiris, whenever the river\r\nreached a height of at least eight cubits 20 it watered Egypt below\r\nMemphis; and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the death of\r\nMoiris, when I heard these things from the priests: now however, unless\r\nthe river rises to sixteen cubits, or fifteen at the least, it does not\r\ngo over the land. I think too that those Egyptians who dwell below the\r\nlake of Moiris and especially in that region which is called the Delta,\r\nif that land continues to grow in height according to this proportion\r\nand to increase similarly in extent, 21 will suffer for all remaining\r\ntime, from the Nile not overflowing their land, that same thing which\r\nthey themselves said that the Hellenes would at some time suffer: for\r\nhearing that the whole land of the Hellenes has rain and is not watered\r\nby rivers as theirs is, they said that the Hellenes would at some time\r\nbe disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills of famine.\r\nThis saying means that if the god 22 shall not send them rain, but shall\r\nallow drought to prevail for a long time, the Hellenes will be destroyed\r\nby hunger; for they have in fact no other supply of water to save them\r\nexcept from Zeus alone.\r\n\r\n14. This has been rightly said by the Egyptians with reference to\r\nthe Hellenes: but now let me tell how matters are with the Egyptians\r\nthemselves in their turn. If, in accordance with what I before said,\r\ntheir land below Memphis (for this is that which is increasing) shall\r\ncontinue to increase in height according to the same proportion as in\r\npast time, assuredly those Egyptians who dwell here will suffer famine,\r\nif their land shall not have rain nor the river be able to go over their\r\nfields. It is certain however that now they gather in fruit from the\r\nearth with less labour than any other men and also with less than the\r\nother Egyptians; for they have no labour in breaking up furrows with a\r\nplough nor in hoeing nor in any other of those labours which other men\r\nhave about a crop; but when the river has come up of itself and watered\r\ntheir fields and after watering has left them again, then each man sows\r\nhis own field and turns into it swine, and when he has trodden the\r\nseed into the ground by means of the swine, after that he waits for the\r\nharvest; and when he has threshed the corn by means of the swine, then\r\nhe gathers it in.\r\n\r\n15. If we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as regards Egypt,\r\nwho say that the Delta alone is Egypt, reckoning its sea-coast to be\r\nfrom the watch-tower called of Perseus to the fish-curing houses of\r\nPelusion, a distance of forty schoines, and counting it to extend inland\r\nas far as the city of Kercasoros, where the Nile divides and runs to\r\nPelusion and Canobos, while as for the rest of Egypt, they assign it\r\npartly to Libya and partly to Arabia,—if, I say, we should follow this\r\naccount, we should thereby declare that in former times the Egyptians\r\nhad no land to live in; for, as we have seen, their Delta at any rate\r\nis alluvial, and has appeared (so to speak) lately, as the Egyptians\r\nthemselves say and as my opinion is. If then at the first there was no\r\nland for them to live in, why did they waste their labour to prove that\r\nthey had come into being before all other men? They needed not to have\r\nmade trial of the children to see what language they would first utter.\r\nHowever I am not of opinion that the Egyptians came into being at the\r\nsame time as that which is called by the Ionians the Delta, but that\r\nthey existed always ever since the human race came into being, and that\r\nas their land advanced forwards, many of them were left in their first\r\nabodes and many came down gradually to the lower parts. At least it is\r\ncertain that in old times Thebes had the name of Egypt, and of this 23\r\nthe circumference measures six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs.\r\n\r\n16. If then we judge aright of these matters, the opinion of the Ionians\r\nabout Egypt is not sound: but if the judgment of the Ionians is right, I\r\ndeclare that neither the Hellenes nor the Ionians themselves know how\r\nto reckon since they say that the whole earth is made up of three\r\ndivisions, Europe, Asia, and Libya: for they ought to count in addition\r\nto these the Delta of Egypt, since it belongs neither to Asia nor to\r\nLibya; for at least it cannot be the river Nile by this reckoning which\r\ndivides Asia from Libya, 24 but the Nile is cleft at the point of this\r\nDelta so as to flow round it, and the result is that this land would\r\ncome between Asia and Libya. 25\r\n\r\n17. We dismiss then the opinion of the Ionians, and express a judgment\r\nof our own in this matter also, that Egypt is all that land which is\r\ninhabited by Egyptians, just as Kilikia is that which is inhabited by\r\nKilikians and Assyria that which is inhabited by Assyrians, and we\r\nknow of no boundary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except\r\nthe borders of Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion which is\r\ncommonly held by the Hellenes, we shall suppose that the whole of Egypt,\r\nbeginning from the Cataract 26 and the city of Elephantine, is divided\r\ninto two parts and that it thus partakes of both the names, since one\r\nside will thus belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from\r\nthe Cataract onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through the midst;\r\nand as far as the city of Kercasoros the Nile flows in one single\r\nstream, but from this city onwards it is parted into three ways; and\r\none, which is called the Pelusian mouth, turns towards the East; the\r\nsecond of the ways goes towards the West, and this is called the Canobic\r\nmouth; but that one of the ways which is straight runs thus,—when the\r\nriver in its course downwards comes to the point of the Delta, then it\r\ncuts the Delta through the midst and so issues out to the sea. In this\r\nwe have 27 a portion of the water of the river which is not the smallest\r\nnor the least famous, and it is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are\r\nalso two other mouths which part off from the Sebennytic and go to\r\nthe sea, and these are called, one the Saïtic, the other the Mendesian\r\nmouth. The Bolbitinitic and Bucolic mouths, on the other hand, are not\r\nnatural but made by digging.\r\n\r\n18. Moreover also the answer given by the Oracle of Ammon bears witness\r\nin support of my opinion that Egypt is of the extent which I declare it\r\nto be in my account; and of this answer I heard after I had formed my\r\nown opinion about Egypt. For those of the city of Marea and of Apis,\r\ndwelling in the parts of Egypt which border on Libya, being of opinion\r\nthemselves that they were Libyans and not Egyptians, and also being\r\nburdened by the rules of religious service, because they desired not to\r\nbe debarred from the use of cows' flesh, sent to Ammon saying that they\r\nhad nought in common with the Egyptians, for they dwelt outside the\r\nDelta and agreed with them in nothing; and they said they desired that\r\nit might be lawful for them to eat everything without distinction. The\r\ngod however did not permit them to do so, but said that that land which\r\nwas Egypt which the Nile came over and watered, and that those were\r\nEgyptians who dwelling below the city of Elephantine drank of that\r\nriver. Thus it was answered to them by the Oracle about this:\r\n\r\n19, and the Nile, when it is in flood, goes over not only the Delta\r\nbut also of the land which is called Libyan and of that which is called\r\nArabian sometimes as much as two days' journey on each side, and at\r\ntimes even more than this or at times less.\r\n\r\nAs regards the nature of the river, neither from the priests nor\r\nyet from any other man was I able to obtain any knowledge: and I was\r\ndesirous especially to learn from them about these matters, namely\r\nwhy the Nile comes down increasing in volume from the summer solstice\r\nonwards for a hundred days, and then, when it has reached the number of\r\nthese days, turns and goes back, failing in its stream, so that through\r\nthe whole winter season it continues to be low, and until the summer\r\nsolstice returns. Of none of these things was I able to receive any\r\naccount from the Egyptians, when I inquired of them what power the Nile\r\nhas whereby it is of a nature opposite to that of other rivers. And\r\nI made inquiry, desiring to know both this which I say and also why,\r\nunlike all other rivers, it does not give rise to any breezes blowing\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n20. However some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction for\r\ncleverness have given an account of this water in three different ways:\r\ntwo of these I do not think it worth while even to speak of except only\r\nto indicate their nature; of which the one says that the Etesian Winds\r\nare the cause that makes the river rise, by preventing the Nile from\r\nflowing out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail and yet the\r\nNile does the same work as it is wont to do; and moreover, if these were\r\nthe cause, all the other rivers also which flow in a direction opposed\r\nto the Etesian Winds ought to have been affected in the same way as the\r\nNile, and even more, in as much as they are smaller and present to them\r\na feebler flow of stream: but there are many of these rivers in Syria\r\nand many also in Libya, and they are affected in no such manner as the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\n21. The second way shows more ignorance than that which has been\r\nmentioned, and it is more marvellous to tell; 28 for it says that the\r\nriver produces these effects because it flows from the Ocean, and that\r\nthe Ocean flows round the whole earth.\r\n\r\n22. The third of the ways is much the most specious, but nevertheless it\r\nis the most mistaken of all: for indeed this way has no more truth in\r\nit than the rest, alleging as it does that the Nile flows from melting\r\nsnow; whereas it flows out of Libya through the midst of the Ethiopians,\r\nand so comes out into Egypt. How then should it flow from snow, when it\r\nflows from the hottest parts to those which are cooler? And indeed most\r\nof the facts are such as to convince a man (one at least who is capable\r\nof reasoning about such matters), that it is not at all likely that it\r\nflows from snow. 29 The first and greatest evidence is afforded by the\r\nwinds, which blow hot from these regions; the second is that the land\r\nis rainless always and without frost, whereas after snow has fallen rain\r\nmust necessarily come within five days, so that if it snowed in those\r\nparts rain would fall there; the third evidence is afforded by the\r\npeople dwelling there, who are of a black colour by reason of the\r\nburning heat. Moreover kites and swallows remain there through the year\r\nand do not leave the land; and cranes flying from the cold weather which\r\ncomes on in the region of Scythia come regularly to these parts for\r\nwintering: if then it snowed ever so little in that land through which\r\nthe Nile flows and in which it has its rise, none of these things would\r\ntake place, as necessity compels us to admit.\r\n\r\n23. As for him who talked about the Ocean, he carried his tale into the\r\nregion of the unknown, and so he need not be refuted; 30 since I for my\r\npart know of no river Ocean existing, but I think that Homer or one of\r\nthe poets who were before him invented the name and introduced it into\r\nhis verse.\r\n\r\n24. If however after I have found fault with the opinions proposed, I\r\nam bound to declare an opinion of my own about the matters which are in\r\ndoubt, I will tell what to my mind is the reason why the Nile increases\r\nin the summer. In the winter season the Sun, being driven away from\r\nhis former path through the heaven 31 by the stormy winds, comes to the\r\nupper parts of Libya. If one would set forth the matter in the shortest\r\nway, all has now been said; for whatever region this god approaches most\r\nand stands directly above, this it may reasonably be supposed is most in\r\nwant of water, and its native streams of rivers are dried up most.\r\n\r\n25. However, to set it forth at greater length, thus it is:—the Sun\r\npassing in his course by the upper parts of Libya, does thus, that is to\r\nsay, since at all times the air in those parts is clear and the country\r\nis warm, because there are no cold winds, 32 in passing through it the\r\nSun does just as he was wont to do in the summer, when going through the\r\nmidst of the heaven, that is he draws to himself the water, and having\r\ndrawn it he drives it away to the upper parts of the country, and the\r\nwinds take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it is\r\nnatural that the winds which blow from this region, namely the South\r\nand South-west Winds, should be much the most rainy of all the winds. I\r\nthink however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water\r\nof the Nile of each year, but that he also lets some remain behind with\r\nhimself. Then when the winter becomes milder, the Sun returns back again\r\nto the midst of the heaven, and from that time onwards he draws equally\r\nfrom all rivers; but in the meanwhile they flow in large volume, since\r\nwater of rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their country\r\nreceives rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however\r\nthey are weak, since not only the showers of rain fail then, but also\r\nthey are drawn by the Sun. The Nile however, alone of all rivers, not\r\nhaving rain and being drawn by the Sun, naturally flows during this time\r\nof winter in much less than its proper volume, that is much less than in\r\nsummer; 33 for then it is drawn equally with all the other waters, but\r\nin winter it bears the burden alone. Thus I suppose the Sun to be the\r\ncause of these things.\r\n\r\n26. He is also the cause in my opinion that the air in these parts is\r\ndry, since he makes it so by scorching up his path through the heaven:\r\n34 thus summer prevails always in the upper parts of Libya. If however\r\nthe station of the seasons had been changed, and where now in the heaven\r\nare placed the North Wind and winter, there was the station of the South\r\nWind and of the midday, and where now is placed the South Wind, there\r\nwas the North, if this had been so, the Sun being driven from the midst\r\nof the heaven by the winter and the North Wind would go to the upper\r\nparts of Europe, just as now he comes to the upper parts of Libya, and\r\npassing in his course throughout the whole of Europe I suppose that he\r\nwould do to the Ister that which he now works upon the Nile.\r\n\r\n27. As to the breeze, why none blows from the river, my opinion is that\r\nfrom very hot places it is not natural that anything should blow, and\r\nthat a breeze is wont to blow from something cold.\r\n\r\n28. Let these matters then be as they are and as they were at the first:\r\nbut as to the sources of the Nile, not one either of the Egyptians or of\r\nthe Libyans or of the Hellenes, who came to speech with me, professed to\r\nknow anything, except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the\r\ncity of Saïs in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking\r\nseriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said\r\nas follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran\r\nup to a sharp point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in\r\nthe district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the mountains\r\nwere, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between\r\nthese two mountains flowed (he said) the sources of the Nile, which were\r\nfathomless in depth, and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards\r\nthe North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for\r\nthe fathomless depth of the source, he said that Psammetichos king of\r\nEgypt came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many\r\nthousands of fathoms and let it down in this place, and it found no\r\nbottom. By this the scribe (if this which he told me was really as he\r\nsaid) gave me to understand 35 that there were certain strong eddies\r\nthere and a backward flow, and that since the water dashed against the\r\nmountains, therefore the sounding-line could not come to any bottom when\r\nit was let down.\r\n\r\n29. From no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter;\r\nbut for the rest I learnt so much as here follows by the most diligent\r\ninquiry; 36 for I went myself as an eye-witness as far as the city of\r\nElephantine and from that point onwards I gathered knowledge by report.\r\nFrom the city of Elephantine as one goes up the river there is country\r\nwhich slopes steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the vessel\r\non both sides, as one fastens an ox, and so make one's way onward;\r\nand if the rope break, the vessel is gone at once, carried away by the\r\nviolence of the stream. Through this country it is a voyage of about\r\nfour days in length, and in this part the Nile is winding like the river\r\nMaiander, and the distance amounts to twelve schoines, which one must\r\ntraverse in this manner. Then you will come to a level plain, in which\r\nthe Nile flows round an island named Tachompso. (Now in the regions\r\nabove Elephantine there dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding, who also\r\noccupy half of the island, 37 and Egyptians the other half.) Adjoining\r\nthis island there is a great lake, round which dwell Ethiopian nomad\r\ntribes; and when you have sailed through this you will come to the\r\nstream of the Nile again, which flows into this lake. After this you\r\nwill disembark and make a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile\r\nsharp rocks stand forth out of the water, and there are many reefs, by\r\nwhich it is not possible for a vessel to pass. Then after having passed\r\nthrough this country in the forty days which I have said, you will\r\nembark again in another vessel and sail for twelve days; and after this\r\nyou will come to a great city called Meroe. This city is said to be\r\nthe mother-city of all the other Ethiopians: and they who dwell in it\r\nreverence of the gods Zeus and Dionysos alone, and these they greatly\r\nhonour; and they have an Oracle of Zeus established, and make warlike\r\nmarches whensoever this god commands them by prophesyings and to\r\nwhatsoever place he commands.\r\n\r\n30. Sailing from this city you will come to the \"Deserters\" in another\r\nperiod of time equal to that in which you came from Elephantine to the\r\nmother-city of the Ethiopians. Now the name of these \"Deserters\" is\r\nAsmach, and this word signifies, when translated into the tongue of the\r\nHellenes, \"those who stand on the left hand of the king.\" These were two\r\nhundred and forty thousand Egyptians of the warrior class, who revolted\r\nand went over to the Ethiopians for the following cause:—In the reign of\r\nPsammetichos garrisons were set, one towards the Ethiopians at the city\r\nof Elephantine, another towards the Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai\r\nof Pelusion, and another towards Libya at Marea: and even in my own\r\ntime the garrisons of the Persians too are ordered in the same manner as\r\nthese were in the reign of Psammetichos, for both at Elephantine and at\r\nDaphnai the Persians have outposts. The Egyptians then of whom I speak\r\nhad served as outposts for three years and no one relieved them from\r\ntheir guard; accordingly they took counsel together, and adopting a\r\ncommon plan they all in a body revolted from Psammetichos and set out\r\nfor Ethiopia. Hearing this Psammetichos set forth in pursuit, and when\r\nhe came up with them he entreated them much and endeavoured to persuade\r\nthem not to desert the gods of their country and their children and\r\nwives: upon which it is said that one of them pointed to his privy\r\nmember and said that wherever this was, there would they have both\r\nchildren and wives. When these came to Ethiopia they gave themselves\r\nover to the king of the Ethiopians; and he rewarded them as\r\nfollows:—there were certain of the Ethiopians who had come to be at\r\nvariance with him; and he bade them drive these out and dwell in their\r\nland. So since these men settled in the land of the Ethiopians, the\r\nEthiopians have come to be of milder manners, from having learnt the\r\ncustoms of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n31. The Nile then, besides that part of its course which is in Egypt,\r\nis known as far as a four months' journey by river and land: for that is\r\nthe number of months which are found by reckoning to be spent in going\r\nfrom Elephantine to these \"Deserters\": and the river runs from the West\r\nand the setting of the sun. But what comes after that no one can clearly\r\nsay; for this land is desert by reason of the burning heat.\r\n\r\n32. Thus much however I heard from men of Kyrene, who told me that they\r\nhad been to the Oracle of Ammon, and had come to speech with Etearchos\r\nking of the Ammonians: and it happened that after speaking of other\r\nmatters they fell to discourse about the Nile and how no one knew the\r\nsources of it; and Etearchos said that once there had come to him men of\r\nthe Nasamonians (this is a Libyan race which dwells in the Syrtis,\r\nand also in the land to the East of the Syrtis reaching to no great\r\ndistance), and when the Nasamonians came and were asked by him whether\r\nthey were able to tell him anything more than he knew about the desert\r\nparts of Libya, they said that there had been among them certain sons of\r\nchief men, who were of unruly disposition; and these when they grew up\r\nto be men had devised various other extravagant things and also they\r\nhad told off by lot five of themselves to go to see the desert parts\r\nof Libya and to try whether they could discover more than those who had\r\npreviously explored furthest: for in those parts of Libya which are by\r\nthe Northern Sea, beginning from Egypt and going as far as the headland\r\nof Soloeis, which is the extreme point of Libya, Libyans (and of them\r\nmany races) extend along the whole coast, except so much as the Hellenes\r\nand Phenicians hold; but in the upper parts, which lie above the\r\nsea-coast and above those people whose land comes down to the sea, Libya\r\nis full of wild beasts; and in the parts above the land of wild beasts\r\nit is full of sand, terribly waterless and utterly desert. These young\r\nmen then (said they), being sent out by their companions well furnished\r\nwith supplies of water and provisions, went first through the inhabited\r\ncountry, and after they had passed through this they came to the country\r\nof wild beasts, and after this they passed through the desert, making\r\ntheir journey towards the West Wind; and having passed through a great\r\ntract of sand in many days, they saw at last trees growing in a level\r\nplace; and having come up to them, they were beginning to pluck the\r\nfruit which was upon the trees: but as they began to pluck it, there\r\ncame upon them small men, of less stature than men of the common size,\r\nand these seized them and carried them away; and neither could the\r\nNasamonians understand anything of their speech nor could those who were\r\ncarrying them off understand anything of the speech of the Nasamonians:\r\nand they led them (so it was said) through very great swamps, and after\r\npassing through these they came to a city in which all the men were in\r\nsize like those who carried them off and in colour of skin black; and\r\nby the city ran a great river, which ran from the West towards the\r\nsunrising, and in it were seen crocodiles.\r\n\r\n33. Of the account given by Etearchos the Ammonian let so much suffice\r\nas is here said, except that, as the men of Kyrene told me, he alleged\r\nthat the Nasamonians returned safe home, and that the people to whom\r\nthey had come were all wizards. Now this river which ran by the city,\r\nEtearchos conjectured to be the Nile, and moreover reason compels us to\r\nthink so; for the Nile flows from Libya and cuts Libya through in the\r\nmidst, and as I conjecture, judging of what is not known by that which\r\nis evident to the view, it starts at a distance from its mouth equal to\r\nthat of the Ister: for the river Ister begins from the Keltoi and the\r\ncity of Pyrene and so runs that it divides Europe in the midst (now\r\nthe Keltoi are outside the Pillars of Heracles and border upon the\r\nKynesians, who dwell furthest towards the sunset of all those who have\r\ntheir dwelling in Europe); and the Ister ends, having its course through\r\nthe whole of Europe, by flowing into the Euxine Sea at the place where\r\nthe Milesians have their settlement of Istria.\r\n\r\n34. Now the Ister, since it flows through land which is inhabited, is\r\nknown by the reports of many; but of the sources of the Nile no one\r\ncan give an account, for the part of Libya through which it flows is\r\nuninhabited and desert. About its course however so much as it was\r\npossible to learn by the most diligent inquiry has been told; and it\r\nruns out into Egypt. Now Egypt lies nearly opposite to the mountain\r\ndistricts of Kilikia; and from thence to Sinope, which lies upon the\r\nEuxine Sea, is a journey in the same straight line of five days for\r\na man without encumbrance; 3701 and Sinope lies opposite to the place\r\nwhere the Ister runs out into the sea: thus I think that the Nile passes\r\nthrough the whole of Libya and is of equal measure with the Ister.\r\n\r\nOf the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said.\r\n\r\n35. Of Egypt however I shall make my report at length, because it has\r\nwonders more in number than any other land, and works too it has to show\r\nas much as any land, which are beyond expression great: for this reason\r\nthen more shall be said concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians in agreement with their climate, which is unlike any\r\nother, and with the river, which shows a nature different from all other\r\nrivers, established for themselves manners and customs in a way opposite\r\nto other men in almost all matters: for among them the women frequent\r\nthe market and carry on trade, while the men remain at home and weave;\r\nand whereas others weave pushing the woof upwards, the Egyptians push\r\nit downwards: the men carry their burdens upon their heads and the\r\nwomen upon their shoulders: the women make water standing up and the\r\nmen crouching down: they ease themselves in their houses and they eat\r\nwithout in the streets, alleging as reason for this that it is right\r\nto do secretly the things that are unseemly though necessary, but those\r\nwhich are not unseemly, in public: no woman is a minister either of male\r\nor female divinity, but men of all, both male and female: to support\r\ntheir parents the sons are in no way compelled, if they do not desire\r\nto do so, but the daughters are forced to do so, be they never so\r\nunwilling.\r\n\r\n36. The priests of the gods in other lands wear long hair, but in Egypt\r\nthey shave their heads: among other men the custom is that in mourning\r\nthose whom the matter concerns most nearly have their hair cut short,\r\nbut the Egyptians, when deaths occur, let their hair grow long, both\r\nthat on the head and that on the chin, having before been close shaven:\r\nother men have their daily living separated from beasts, but the\r\nEgyptians have theirs together with beasts: other men live on wheat and\r\nbarley, but to any one of the Egyptians who makes his living on these it\r\nis a great reproach; they make their bread of maize, 38 which some call\r\nspelt; 39 they knead dough with their feet and clay with their hands,\r\nwith which also they gather up dung: and whereas other men, except\r\nsuch as have learnt otherwise from the Egyptians, have their members as\r\nnature made them, the Egyptians practise circumcision: as to garments,\r\nthe men wear two each and the women but one: and whereas others make\r\nfast the rings and ropes of the sails outside the ship, the Egyptians\r\ndo this inside: finally in the writing of characters and reckoning with\r\npebbles, while the Hellenes carry the hand from the left to the right,\r\nthe Egyptians do this from the right to the left; and doing so they say\r\nthat they do it themselves rightwise and the Hellenes leftwise: and they\r\nuse two kinds of characters for writing, of which the one kind is called\r\nsacred and the other common. 40\r\n\r\n37. They are religious excessively beyond all other men, and with regard\r\nto this they have customs as follows:—they drink from cups of bronze and\r\nrinse them out every day, and not some only do this but all: they wear\r\ngarments of linen always newly washed, and this they make a special\r\npoint of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake of\r\ncleanliness, preferring to be clean rather than comely. The priests\r\nshave themselves all over their body every other day, so that no lice or\r\nany other foul thing may come to be upon them when they minister to\r\nthe gods; and the priests wear garments of linen only and sandals of\r\npapyrus, and any other garment they may not take nor other sandals;\r\nthese wash themselves in cold water twice in the day and twice again\r\nin the night; and other religious services they perform (one may almost\r\nsay) of infinite number. 41 They enjoy also good things not a few, for\r\nthey do not consume or spend anything of their own substance, but there\r\nis sacred bread baked for them and they have each great quantity of\r\nflesh of oxen and geese coming in to them each day, and also wine of\r\ngrapes is given to them; but it is not permitted to them to taste of\r\nfish: beans moreover the Egyptians do not at all sow in their land, and\r\nthose which grow they neither eat raw nor boil for food; nay the priests\r\ndo not endure even to look upon them, thinking this to be an unclean\r\nkind of pulse: and there is not one priest only for each of the gods but\r\nmany, and of them one is chief-priest, and whenever a priest dies his\r\nson is appointed to his place.\r\n\r\n38. The males of the ox kind they consider to belong to Epaphos, and\r\non account of him they test them in the following manner:—If the priest\r\nsees one single black hair upon the beast he counts it not clean for\r\nsacrifice; and one of the priests who is appointed for the purpose makes\r\ninvestigation of these matters, both when the beast is standing upright\r\nand when it is lying on its back, drawing out its tongue moreover, to\r\nsee if it is clean in respect of the appointed signs, which I shall tell\r\nof in another part of the history: 42 he looks also at the hairs of the\r\ntail to see if it has them growing in the natural manner: and if it\r\nbe clean in respect of all these things, he marks it with a piece of\r\npapyrus, rolling this round the horns, and then when he has plastered\r\nsealing-earth over it he sets upon it the seal of his signet-ring, and\r\nafter that they take the animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast\r\nnot sealed the penalty appointed is death.\r\n\r\n39. In this way then the beast is tested; and their appointed manner of\r\nsacrifice is as follows:—they lead the sealed beast to the altar where\r\nthey happen to be sacrificing and then kindle a fire: after that, having\r\npoured libations of wine over the altar so that it runs down upon the\r\nvictim and having called upon the god, they cut its throat, and having\r\ncut its throat they sever the head from the body. The body then of the\r\nbeast they flay, but upon the head 43 they make many imprecations first,\r\nand then they who have a market and Hellenes sojourning among them for\r\ntrade, these carry it to the market-place and sell it, while they who\r\nhave no Hellenes among them cast it away into the river: and this is the\r\nform of imprecation which they utter upon the heads, praying that if any\r\nevil be about to befall either themselves who are offering sacrifice or\r\nthe land of Egypt in general, it may come rather upon this head. Now\r\nas regards the heads of the beasts which are sacrificed and the pouring\r\nover them of the wine, all the Egyptians have the same customs equally\r\nfor all their sacrifices; and by reason of this custom none of the\r\nEgyptians eat of the head either of this or of any other kind of animal:\r\n\r\n40, but the manner of disembowelling the victims and of burning them is\r\nappointed among them differently for different sacrifices; I shall\r\nspeak however of the sacrifices to that goddess whom they regard as the\r\ngreatest of all, and to whom they celebrate the greatest feast.—When\r\nthey have flayed the bullock and made imprecation, they take out the\r\nwhole of its lower entrails but leave in the body the upper entrails and\r\nthe fat; and they sever from it the legs and the end of the loin and the\r\nshoulders and the neck: and this done, they fill the rest of the body of\r\nthe animal with consecrated 44 loaves and honey and raisins and figs and\r\nfrankincense and myrrh and every other kind of spices, and having filled\r\nit with these they offer it, pouring over it great abundance of oil.\r\nThey make their sacrifice after fasting, and while the offerings are\r\nbeing burnt, they all beat themselves for mourning, and when they have\r\nfinished beating themselves they set forth as a feast that which they\r\nleft unburnt of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n41. The clean males then of the ox kind, both full-grown animals and\r\ncalves, are sacrificed by all the Egyptians; the females however they\r\nmay not sacrifice, but these are sacred to Isis; for the figure of Isis\r\nis in the form of a woman with cow's horns, just as the Hellenes present\r\nIo in pictures, and all the Egyptians without distinction reverence cows\r\nfar more than any other kind of cattle; for which reason neither man nor\r\nwoman of Egyptian race would kiss a man who is a Hellene on the mouth,\r\nnor will they use a knife or roasting-spits or a caldron belonging to\r\na Hellene, nor taste of the flesh even of a clean animal if it has been\r\ncut with the knife of a Hellene. And the cattle of this kind which die\r\nthey bury in the following manner:—the females they cast into the river,\r\nbut the males they bury, each people in the suburb of their town, with\r\none of the horns, or sometimes both, protruding to mark the place; and\r\nwhen the bodies have rotted away and the appointed time comes on, then\r\nto each city comes a boat 45 from that which is called the island of\r\nProsopitis (this is in the Delta, and the extent of its circuit is nine\r\nschoines). In this island of Prosopitis is situated, besides many other\r\ncities, that one from which the boats come to take up the bones of the\r\noxen, and the name of the city is Atarbechis, and in it there is set\r\nup a holy temple of Aphrodite. From this city many go abroad in various\r\ndirections, some to one city and others to another, and when they have\r\ndug up the bones of the oxen they carry them off, and coming together\r\nthey bury them in one single place. In the same manner as they bury the\r\noxen they bury also their other cattle when they die; for about them\r\nalso they have the same law laid down, and these also they abstain from\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\n42. Now all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus or who are of\r\nthe district of Thebes, these, I say, all sacrifice goats and abstain\r\nfrom sheep: for not all the Egyptians equally reverence the same gods,\r\nexcept only Isis and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos), these they all\r\nreverence alike: but they who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the\r\nMendesian district, these abstain from goats and sacrifice sheep. Now\r\nthe men of Thebes and those who after their example abstain from sheep,\r\nsay that this custom was established among them for the cause which\r\nfollows:—Heracles (they say) had an earnest desire to see Zeus, and Zeus\r\ndid not desire to be seen of him; and at last when Heracles was urgent\r\nin entreaty Zeus contrived this device, that is to say, he flayed a ram\r\nand held in front of him the head of the ram which he had cut off, and\r\nhe put on over him the fleece and then showed himself to him. Hence\r\nthe Egyptians make the image of Zeus into the face of a ram; and the\r\nAmmonians do so also after their example, being settlers both from\r\nthe Egyptians and from the Ethiopians, and using a language which is a\r\nmedley of both tongues: and in my opinion it is from this god that the\r\nAmmonians took the name which they have, for the Egyptians call Zeus\r\nAmun. The Thebans then do not sacrifice rams but hold them sacred for\r\nthis reason; on one day however in the year, on the feast of Zeus, they\r\ncut up in the same manner and flay one single ram and cover with its\r\nskin the image of Zeus, and then they bring up to it another image\r\nof Heracles. This done, all who are in the temple beat themselves in\r\nlamentation for the ram, and then they bury it in a sacred tomb.\r\n\r\n43. About Heracles I heard the account given that he was of the number\r\nof the twelve gods; but of the other Heracles whom the Hellenes know I\r\nwas not able to hear in any part of Egypt: and moreover to prove that\r\nthe Egyptians did not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes, but\r\nrather the Hellenes from the Egyptians,—that is to say those of the\r\nHellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of Amphitryon,—of that, I\r\nsay, besides many other evidences there is chiefly this, namely that the\r\nparents of this Heracles, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of Egypt by\r\ndescent, 46 and also that the Egyptians say that they do not know\r\nthe names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi, nor have these been\r\naccepted by them as gods among the other gods; whereas if they had\r\nreceived from the Hellenes the name of any divinity, they would\r\nnaturally have preserved the memory of these most of all, assuming that\r\nin those times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to make voyages\r\n4601 and were sea-faring folk, as I suppose and as my judgment compels\r\nme to think; so that the Egyptians would have learnt the names of these\r\ngods even more than that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a\r\nvery ancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves) it is seventeen\r\nthousand years to the beginning of the reign of Amasis from the time\r\nwhen the twelve gods, of whom they count that Heracles is one, were\r\nbegotten of the eight gods.\r\n\r\n44. I moreover, desiring to know something certain of these matters so\r\nfar as might be, made a voyage also to Tyre of Phenicia, hearing that\r\nin that place there was a holy temple of Heracles; and I saw that it\r\nwas richly furnished with many votive offerings besides, and especially\r\nthere were in it two pillars, 47 the one of pure gold and the other of\r\nan emerald stone of such size as to shine by night: 48 and having come\r\nto speech with the priests of the god, I asked them how long time it\r\nwas since their temple had been set up: and these also I found to be\r\nat variance with the Hellenes, for they said that at the same time when\r\nTyre was founded, the temple of the god also had been set up, and that\r\nit was a period of two thousand three hundred years since their people\r\nbegan to dwell at Tyre. I saw also at Tyre another temple of Heracles,\r\nwith the surname Thasian; and I came to Thasos also and there I found a\r\ntemple of Heracles set up by the Phenicians, who had sailed out to seek\r\nfor Europa and had colonised Thasos; and these things happened full five\r\ngenerations of men before Heracles the son of Amphitryon was born in\r\nHellas. So then my inquiries show clearly that Heracles is an ancient\r\ngod, and those of the Hellenes seem to me to act most rightly who have\r\ntwo temples of Heracles set up, and who sacrifice to the one as an\r\nimmortal god and with the title Olympian, and make offerings of the dead\r\n49 to the other as a hero.\r\n\r\n45. Moreover, besides many other stories which the Hellenes tell without\r\ndue consideration, this tale is especially foolish which they tell about\r\nHeracles, namely that when he came to Egypt, the Egyptians put on him\r\nwreaths and led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; and he\r\nfor some time kept quiet, but when they were beginning the sacrifice of\r\nhim at the altar, he betook himself to prowess and slew them all. I for\r\nmy part am of opinion that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are\r\naltogether without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyptians;\r\nfor how should they for whom it is not lawful to sacrifice even beasts,\r\nexcept swine 50 and the males of oxen and calves (such of them as are\r\nclean) and geese, how should these sacrifice human beings? Besides this,\r\nhow is it in nature possible that Heracles, being one person only and\r\nmoreover a man (as they assert), should slay many myriads? Having said\r\nso much of these matters, we pray that we may have grace from both the\r\ngods and the heroes for our speech.\r\n\r\n46. Now the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I have mentioned do\r\nnot sacrifice goats, female or male, is this:—the Mendesians count Pan\r\nto be one of the eight gods (now these eight gods they say came into\r\nbeing before the twelve gods), and the painters and image-makers\r\nrepresent in painting and in sculpture the figure of Pan, just as the\r\nHellenes do, with goat's face and legs, not supposing him to be really\r\nlike this but to resemble the other gods; the cause however why they\r\nrepresent him in this form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then\r\nreverence all goats and the males more than the females (and the\r\ngoatherds too have greater honour than other herdsmen), but of the goats\r\none especially is reverenced, and when he dies there is great mourning\r\nin all the Mendesian district: and both the goat and Pan are called in\r\nthe Egyptian tongue Mendes. Moreover in my lifetime there happened in\r\nthat district this marvel, that is to say a he-goat had intercourse with\r\na woman publicly, and this was so done that all men might have evidence\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n47. The pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable animal; and\r\nfirst, if any of them in passing by touch a pig, he goes into the river\r\nand dips himself forthwith in the water together with his garments; and\r\nthen too swineherds, though they be native Egyptians, unlike all others\r\ndo not enter any of the temples in Egypt, nor is anyone willing to give\r\nhis daughter in marriage to one of them or to take a wife from among\r\nthem; but the swineherds both give in marriage to one another and take\r\nfrom one another. Now to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it\r\nright to sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at the\r\nsame time and on the same full-moon they sacrifice swine, and then eat\r\ntheir flesh: and as to the reason why, when they abominate swine at all\r\ntheir other feasts, they sacrifice them at this, there is a story told\r\nby the Egyptians; and this story I know, but it is not a seemly one for\r\nme to tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is performed as\r\nfollows:—when the priest has slain the victim, he puts together the end\r\nof the tail and the spleen and the caul, and covers them up with the\r\nwhole of the fat of the animal which is about the paunch, and then he\r\noffers them with fire; and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of\r\nfull moon upon which they have held the sacrifice, but on any day after\r\nthis they will not taste of it: the poor however among them by reason of\r\nthe scantiness of their means shape pigs of dough and having baked them\r\nthey offer these as a sacrifice.\r\n\r\n48. Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival each one kills a pig by\r\ncutting its throat before his own doors, and after that he gives the pig\r\nto the swineherd who sold it to him, to carry away again; and the rest\r\nof the feast of Dionysos is celebrated by the Egyptians in the same\r\nway as by the Hellenes in almost all things except choral dances, but\r\ninstead of the phallos they have invented another contrivance, namely\r\nfigures of about a cubit in height worked by strings, which women carry\r\nabout the villages, with the privy member made to move and not much\r\nless in size than the rest of the body: and a flute goes before and they\r\nfollow singing the praises of Dionysos. As to the reason why the figure\r\nhas this member larger than is natural and moves it, though it moves no\r\nother part of the body, about this there is a sacred story told.\r\n\r\n49. Now I think that Melampus the son of Amytheon was not without\r\nknowledge of these rites of sacrifice, but was acquainted with them: for\r\nMelampus is he who first set forth to the Hellenes the name of Dionysos\r\nand the manner of sacrifice and the procession of the phallos. Strictly\r\nspeaking indeed, he when he made it known did not take in the whole, but\r\nthose wise men who came after him made it known more at large. Melampus\r\nthen is he who taught of the phallos which is carried in procession for\r\nDionysos, and from him the Hellenes learnt to do that which they do. I\r\nsay then that Melampus being a man of ability contrived for himself an\r\nart of divination, and having learnt from Egypt he taught the Hellenes\r\nmany things, and among them those that concern Dionysos, making changes\r\nin some few points of them: for I shall not say that that which is done\r\nin worship of the god in Egypt came accidentally to be the same with\r\nthat which is done among the Hellenes, for then these rites would have\r\nbeen in character with the Hellenic worship and not lately brought in;\r\nnor certainly shall I say that the Egyptians took from the Hellenes\r\neither this or any other customary observance: but I think it most\r\nprobable that Melampus learnt the matters concerning Dionysos from\r\nCadmos the Tyrian and from those who came with him from Phenicia to the\r\nland which we now call Boeotia.\r\n\r\n50. Moreover the naming 51 of almost all the gods has come to Hellas\r\nfrom Egypt: for that it has come from the Barbarians I find by inquiry\r\nis true, and I am of opinion that most probably it has come from Egypt,\r\nbecause, except in the case of Poseidon and the Dioscuroi (in accordance\r\nwith that which I have said before), and also of Hera and Hestia and\r\nThemis and the Charites and Nereïds, the Egyptians have had the names\r\nof all the other gods in their country for all time. What I say here\r\nis that which the Egyptians think themselves: but as for the gods whose\r\nnames they profess that they do not know, these I think received their\r\nnaming from the Pelasgians, except Poseidon; but about this god the\r\nHellenes learnt from the Libyans, for no people except the Libyans have\r\nhad the name of Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this\r\ngod always. Nor, it may be added, have the Egyptians any custom of\r\nworshipping heroes.\r\n\r\n51. These observances then, and others besides these which I shall\r\nmention, the Hellenes have adopted from the Egyptians; but to make, as\r\nthey do, the images of Hermes with the phallos they have learnt not from\r\nthe Egyptians but from the Pelasgians, the custom having been received\r\nby the Athenians first of all the Hellenes and from these by the rest;\r\nfor just at the time when the Athenians were beginning to rank among the\r\nHellenes, the Pelasgians became dwellers with them in their land, and\r\nfrom this very cause it was that they began to be counted as Hellenes.\r\nWhosoever has been initiated in the mysteries of the Cabeiroi, which the\r\nSamothrakians perform having received them from the Pelasgians, that\r\nman knows the meaning of my speech; for these very Pelasgians who\r\nbecame dwellers with the Athenians used to dwell before that time in\r\nSamothrake, and from them the Samothrakians received their mysteries. So\r\nthen the Athenians were the first of the Hellenes who made the images\r\nof Hermes with the phallos, having learnt from the Pelasgians; and\r\nthe Pelasgians told a sacred story about it, which is set forth in the\r\nmysteries in Samothrake.\r\n\r\n52. Now the Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices\r\ncalling upon the gods in prayer, as I know from that which I heard at\r\nDodona, but they gave no title or name to any of them, for they had\r\nnot yet heard any, but they called them gods ({theous}) from some such\r\nnotion as this, that they had set ({thentes}) in order all things and\r\nso had the distribution of everything. Afterwards, when much time\r\nhad elapsed, they learnt from Egypt the names of the gods, all except\r\nDionysos, for his name they learnt long afterwards; and after a time\r\nthe Pelasgians consulted the Oracle at Dodona about the names, for this\r\nprophetic seat is accounted to be the most ancient of the Oracles which\r\nare among the Hellenes, and at that time it was the only one. So when\r\nthe Pelasgians asked the Oracle at Dodona whether they should adopt the\r\nnames which had come from the Barbarians, the Oracle in reply bade them\r\nmake use of the names. From this time they sacrificed using the names of\r\nthe gods, and from the Pelasgians the Hellenes afterwards received them:\r\n\r\n53, but whence the several gods had their birth, or whether they all\r\nwere from the beginning, and of what form they are, they did not learn\r\ntill yesterday, as it were, or the day before: for Hesiod and Homer I\r\nsuppose were four hundred years before my time and not more, and these\r\nare they who made a theogony for the Hellenes and gave the titles to\r\nthe gods and distributed to them honours and arts, and set forth their\r\nforms: but the poets who are said to have been before these men were\r\nreally in my opinion after them. Of these things the first are said by\r\nthe priestesses of Dodona, and the latter things, those namely which\r\nhave regard to Hesiod and Homer, by myself.\r\n\r\n54. As regards the Oracles both that among the Hellenes and that in\r\nLibya, the Egyptians tell the following tale. The priests of the Theban\r\nZeus told me that two women in the service of the temple had been\r\ncarried away from Thebes by Phenicians, and that they had heard that one\r\nof them had been sold to go into Libya and the other to the Hellenes;\r\nand these women, they said, were they who first founded the prophetic\r\nseats among the nations which have been named: and when I inquired\r\nwhence they knew so perfectly of this tale which they told, they said\r\nin reply that a great search had been made by the priests after these\r\nwomen, and that they had not been able to find them, but they had heard\r\nafterwards this tale about them which they were telling.\r\n\r\n55. This I heard from the priests at Thebes, and what follows is said by\r\nthe prophetesses 52 of Dodona. They say that two black doves flew from\r\nThebes to Egypt, and came one of them to Libya and the other to their\r\nland. And this latter settled upon an oak-tree 53 and spoke with human\r\nvoice, saying that it was necessary that a prophetic seat of Zeus should\r\nbe established in that place; and they supposed that that was of the\r\ngods which was announced to them, and made one accordingly: and the dove\r\nwhich went away to the Libyans, they say, bade the Libyans to make an\r\nOracle of Ammon; and this also is of Zeus. The priestesses of Dodona\r\ntold me these things, of whom the eldest was named Promeneia, the next\r\nafter her Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra; and the other people of\r\nDodona who were engaged about the temple gave accounts agreeing with\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n56. I however have an opinion about the matter as follows:—If the\r\nPhenicians did in truth carry away the consecrated women and sold one of\r\nthem into Libya and the other into Hellas, I suppose that in the country\r\nnow called Hellas, which was formerly called Pelasgia, this woman was\r\nsold into the land of the Thesprotians; and then being a slave there she\r\nset up a sanctuary of Zeus under a real oak-tree; 54 as indeed it was\r\nnatural that being an attendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes, she\r\nshould there, in the place to which she had come, have a memory of him;\r\nand after this, when she got understanding of the Hellenic tongue, she\r\nestablished an Oracle, and she reported, I suppose, that her sister had\r\nbeen sold in Libya by the same Phenicians by whom she herself had been\r\nsold.\r\n\r\n57. Moreover, I think that the women were called doves by the people of\r\nDodona for the reason that they were Barbarians and because it seemed to\r\nthem that they uttered voice like birds; but after a time (they say) the\r\ndove spoke with human voice, that is when the woman began to speak so\r\nthat they could understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian tongue\r\nshe seemed to them to be uttering voice like a bird: for had it been\r\nreally a dove, how could it speak with human voice? And in saying that\r\nthe dove was black, they indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The\r\nways of delivering oracles too at Thebes in Egypt and at Dodona closely\r\nresemble one another, as it happens, and also the method of divination\r\nby victims has come from Egypt.\r\n\r\n58. Moreover, it is true also that the Egyptians were the first of men\r\nwho made solemn assemblies 55 and processions and approaches to the\r\ntemples, 56 and from them the Hellenes have learnt them, and my evidence\r\nfor this is that the Egyptian celebrations of these have been held from\r\na very ancient time, whereas the Hellenic were introduced 57 but lately.\r\n\r\n59. The Egyptians hold their solemn assemblies not once in the year but\r\noften, especially and with the greatest zeal and devotion 58 at the\r\ncity of Bubastis for Artemis, and next at Busiris for Isis; for in this\r\nlast-named city there is a very great temple of Isis, and this city\r\nstands in the middle of the Delta of Egypt; now Isis is in the tongue of\r\nthe Hellenes Demeter: thirdly, they have a solemn assembly at the city\r\nof Saïs for Athene, fourthly at Heliopolis for the Sun (Helios), fifthly\r\nat the city of Buto in honour of Leto, and sixthly at the city of\r\nPapremis for Ares.\r\n\r\n60. Now, when they are coming to the city of Bubastis they do as\r\nfollows:—they sail men and women together, and a great multitude of each\r\nsex in every boat; and some of the women have rattles and rattle with\r\nthem, while some of the men play the flute during the whole time of the\r\nvoyage, and the rest, both women and men, sing and clap their hands; and\r\nwhen as they sail they come opposite to any city on the way they bring\r\nthe boat to land, and some of the women continue to do as I have said,\r\nothers cry aloud and jeer at the women in that city, some dance, and\r\nsome stand up and pull up their garments. This they do by every city\r\nalong the river-bank; and when they come to Bubastis they hold festival\r\ncelebrating great sacrifices, and more wine of grapes is consumed upon\r\nthat festival than during the whole of the rest of the year. To this\r\nplace (so say the natives) they come together year by year 59 even to\r\nthe number of seventy myriads 5901 of men and women, besides children.\r\n\r\n61. Thus it is done here; and how they celebrate the festival in honour\r\nof Isis at the city of Busiris has been told by me before: 60 for, as I\r\nsaid, they beat themselves in mourning after the sacrifice, all of them\r\nboth men and women, very many myriads of people; but for whom they beat\r\nthemselves it is not permitted to me by religion to say: and so many as\r\nthere are of the Carians dwelling in Egypt do this even more than the\r\nEgyptians themselves, inasmuch as they cut their foreheads also with\r\nknives; and by this it is manifested that they are strangers and not\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n62. At the times when they gather together at the city of Saïs for their\r\nsacrifices, on a certain night 61 they all kindle lamps many in number\r\nin the open air round about the houses; now the lamps are saucers full\r\nof salt and oil mixed, and the wick floats by itself on the surface, and\r\nthis burns during the whole night; and to the festival is given the name\r\nLychnocaia (the lighting of the lamps). Moreover those of the Egyptians\r\nwho have not come to this solemn assembly observe the night of the\r\nfestival and themselves also light lamps all of them, and thus not in\r\nSaïs alone are they lighted, but over all Egypt: and as to the reason\r\nwhy light and honour are allotted to this night, 62 about this there is\r\na sacred story told.\r\n\r\n63. To Heliopolis and Buto they go year by year and do sacrifice only:\r\nbut at Papremis they do sacrifice and worship as elsewhere, and besides\r\nthat, when the sun begins to go down, while some few of the priests are\r\noccupied with the image of the god, the greater number of them stand in\r\nthe entrance of the temple with wooden clubs, and other persons to the\r\nnumber of more than a thousand men with purpose to perform a vow, these\r\nalso having all of them staves of wood, stand in a body opposite to\r\nthose: and the image, which is in a small shrine of wood covered over\r\nwith gold, they take out on the day before to another sacred building.\r\nThe few then who have been left about the image, draw a wain with four\r\nwheels, which bears the shrine and the image that is within the shrine,\r\nand the other priests standing in the gateway try to prevent it from\r\nentering, and the men who are under a vow come to the assistance of the\r\ngod and strike them, while the others defend themselves. 63 Then there\r\ncomes to be a hard fight with staves, and they break one another's\r\nheads, and I am of opinion that many even die of the wounds they\r\nreceive; the Egyptians however told me that no one died. This solemn\r\nassembly the people of the place say that they established for the\r\nfollowing reason:—the mother of Ares, they say, used to dwell in this\r\ntemple, and Ares, having been brought up away from her, when he grew\r\nup came thither desiring to visit his mother, and the attendants of his\r\nmother's temple, not having seen him before, did not permit him to pass\r\nin, but kept him away; and he brought men to help him from another city\r\nand handled roughly the attendants of the temple, and entered to visit\r\nhis mother. Hence, they say, this exchange of blows has become the\r\ncustom in honour of Ares upon his festival.\r\n\r\n64. The Egyptians were the first who made it a point of religion not to\r\nlie with women in temples, nor to enter into temples after going away\r\nfrom women without first bathing: for almost all other men except the\r\nEgyptians and the Hellenes lie with women in temples and enter into a\r\ntemple after going away from women without bathing, since they hold that\r\nthere is no difference in this respect between men and beasts: for\r\nthey say that they see beasts and the various kinds of birds coupling\r\ntogether both in the temples and in the sacred enclosures of the gods;\r\nif then this were not pleasing to the god, the beasts would not do so.\r\n\r\n65. Thus do these defend that which they do, which by me is disallowed:\r\nbut the Egyptians are excessively careful in their observances, both\r\nin other matters which concern the sacred rites and also in those which\r\nfollow:—Egypt, though it borders upon Libya, 6301 does not very much\r\nabound in wild animals, but such as they have are one and all accounted\r\nby them sacred, some of them living with men and others not. But if I\r\nshould say for what reasons the sacred animals have been thus dedicated,\r\nI should fall into discourse of matters pertaining to the gods, of\r\nwhich I most desire not to speak; and what I have actually said touching\r\nslightly upon them, I said because I was constrained by necessity.\r\nAbout these animals there is a custom of this kind:—persons have been\r\nappointed of the Egyptians, both men and women, to provide the food for\r\neach kind of beast separately, and their office goes down from father\r\nto son; and those who dwell in the various cities perform vows to\r\nthem thus, that is, when they make a vow to the god to whom the animal\r\nbelongs, they shave the head of their children either the whole or\r\nthe half or the third part of it, and then set the hair in the balance\r\nagainst silver, and whatever it weighs, this the man gives to the person\r\nwho provides for the animals, and she cuts up fish of equal value and\r\ngives it for food to the animals. Thus food for their support has been\r\nappointed: and if any one kill any of these animals, the penalty, if he\r\ndo it with his own will, is death, and if against his will, such penalty\r\nas the priests may appoint: but whosoever shall kill an ibis or a hawk,\r\nwhether it be with his will or against his will, must die.\r\n\r\n66. Of the animals that live with men there are great numbers, and would\r\nbe many more but for the accidents which befall the cats. For when the\r\nfemales have produced young they are no longer in the habit of going\r\nto the males, and these seeking to be united with them are not able. To\r\nthis end then they contrive as follows,—they either take away by force\r\nor remove secretly the young from the females and kill them (but after\r\nkilling they do not eat them), and the females being deprived of their\r\nyoung and desiring more, therefore come to the males, for it is a\r\ncreature that is fond of its young. Moreover when a fire occurs, the\r\ncats seem to be divinely possessed; 64 for while the Egyptians stand at\r\nintervals and look after the cats, not taking any care to extinguish the\r\nfire, the cats slipping through or leaping over the men, jump into the\r\nfire; and when this happens, great mourning comes upon the Egyptians.\r\nAnd in whatever houses a cat has died by a natural death, all those who\r\ndwell in this house shave their eyebrows only, but those in whose houses\r\na dog has died shave their whole body and also their head.\r\n\r\n67. The cats when they are dead are carried away to sacred buildings in\r\nthe city of Bubastis, where after being embalmed they are buried; but\r\nthe dogs they bury each people in their own city in sacred tombs;\r\nand the ichneumons are buried just in the same way as the dogs. The\r\nshrew-mice however and the hawks they carry away to the city of Buto,\r\nand the ibises to Hermopolis; 65 the bears (which are not commonly seen)\r\nand the wolves, not much larger in size than foxes, they bury on the\r\nspot where they are found lying.\r\n\r\n68. Of the crocodile the nature is as follows:—during the four most\r\nwintry months this creature eats nothing: she has four feet and is an\r\nanimal belonging to the land and the water both; for she produces and\r\nhatches eggs on the land, and the most part of the day she remains upon\r\ndry land, but the whole of the night in the river, for the water in\r\ntruth is warmer than the unclouded open air and the dew. Of all the\r\nmortal creatures of which we have knowledge this grows to the greatest\r\nbulk from the smallest beginning; for the eggs which she produces are\r\nnot much larger than those of geese and the newly-hatched young one\r\nis in proportion to the egg, but as he grows he becomes as much as\r\nseventeen cubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those\r\nof a pig and teeth large and tusky, in proportion to the size of his\r\nbody; but unlike all other beasts he grows no tongue, neither does he\r\nmove his lower jaw, but brings the upper jaw towards the lower, being\r\nin this too unlike all other beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a\r\nscaly hide upon his back which cannot be pierced; and he is blind in the\r\nwater, but in the air he is of very keen sight. Since he has his living\r\nin the water he keeps his mouth all full within of leeches; and whereas\r\nall other birds and beasts fly from him, the trochilus is a creature\r\nwhich is at peace with him, seeing that from her he receives benefit;\r\nfor the crocodile having come out of the water to the land and then\r\nhaving opened his mouth (this he is wont to do generally towards the\r\nWest Wind), the trochilus upon that enters into his mouth and swallows\r\ndown the leeches, and he being benefited is pleased and does no harm to\r\nthe trochilus.\r\n\r\n69. Now for some of the Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred animals, and\r\nfor others not so, but they treat them on the contrary as enemies: those\r\nhowever who dwell about Thebes and about the lake of Moiris hold them\r\nto be most sacred, and each of these two peoples keeps one crocodile\r\nselected from the whole number, which has been trained to tameness, and\r\nthey put hanging ornaments of molten stone and of gold into the ears\r\nof these and anklets round the front feet, and they give them food\r\nappointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well as possible\r\nwhile they live, and after they are dead they bury them in sacred tombs,\r\nembalming them: but those who dwell about the city of Elephantine even\r\neat them, not holding them to be sacred. They are called not crocodiles\r\nbut champsai, and the Ionians gave them the name of crocodile, comparing\r\ntheir form to that of the crocodiles (lizards) which appear in their\r\ncountry in the stone walls.\r\n\r\n70. There are many ways in use of catching them and of various kinds: I\r\nshall describe that which to me seems the most worthy of being told. A\r\nman puts the back of a pig upon a hook as bait, and lets it go into the\r\nmiddle of the river, while he himself upon the bank of the river has\r\na young live pig, which he beats; and the crocodile hearing its cries\r\nmakes for the direction of the sound, and when he finds the pig's back\r\nhe swallows it down: then they pull, and when he is drawn out to land,\r\nfirst of all the hunter forthwith plasters up his eyes with mud, and\r\nhaving so done he very easily gets the mastery of him, but if he does\r\nnot do so he has much trouble.\r\n\r\n71. The river-horse is sacred in the district of Papremis, but for the\r\nother Egyptians he is not sacred; and this is the appearance which he\r\npresents: he is four-footed, cloven-hoofed like an ox, 66 flat-nosed,\r\nwith a mane like a horse and showing teeth like tusks, with a tail and\r\nvoice like a horse, and in size as large as the largest ox; and his hide\r\nis so exceedingly thick that when it has been dried shafts of javelins\r\nare made of it.\r\n\r\n72. There are moreover otters in the river, which they consider to be\r\nsacred; and of fish also they esteem that which is called the lepidotos\r\nto be sacred, and also the eel; and these they say are sacred to the\r\nNile: and of birds the fox-goose.\r\n\r\n73. There is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I did\r\nnot myself see except in painting, for in truth he comes to them very\r\nrarely, at intervals, as the people of Heliopolis say, of five hundred\r\nyears; and these say that he comes regularly when his father dies; and\r\nif he be like the painting, he is of this size and nature, that is to\r\nsay, some of his feathers are of gold colour and others red, and in\r\noutline and size he is as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird\r\nthey say (but I cannot believe the story) contrives as follows:—setting\r\nforth from Arabia he conveys his father, they say, to the temple of the\r\nSun (Helios) plastered up in myrrh, and buries him in the temple of the\r\nSun; and he conveys him thus:—he forms first an egg of myrrh as large as\r\nhe is able to carry, and then he makes trial of carrying it, and when he\r\nhas made trial sufficiently, then he hollows out the egg and places his\r\nfather within it and plasters over with other myrrh that part of the egg\r\nwhere he hollowed it out to put his father in, and when his father is\r\nlaid in it, it proves (they say) to be of the same weight as it was;\r\nand after he has plastered it up, he conveys the whole to Egypt to the\r\ntemple of the Sun. Thus they say that this bird does.\r\n\r\n74. There are also about Thebes sacred serpents, not at all harmful to\r\nmen, which are small in size and have two horns growing from the top of\r\nthe head: these they bury when they die in the temple of Zeus, for to\r\nthis god they say that they are sacred.\r\n\r\n75. There is a region moreover in Arabia, situated nearly over against\r\nthe city of Buto, to which place I came to inquire about the winged\r\nserpents: and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in\r\nquantity so great that it is impossible to make report of the number,\r\nand there were heaps of spines, some heaps large and others less large\r\nand others smaller still than these, and these heaps were many in\r\nnumber. This region in which the spines are scattered upon the ground\r\nis of the nature of an entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great\r\nplain, which plain adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that\r\nat the beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards\r\nEgypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance to this\r\ncountry and do not suffer the serpents to go by but kill them. On\r\naccount of this deed it is (say the Arabians) that the ibis has come to\r\nbe greatly honoured by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians also agree that\r\nit is for this reason that they honour these birds.\r\n\r\n76. The outward form of the ibis is this:—it is a deep black all over,\r\nand has legs like those of a crane and a very curved beak, and in size\r\nit is about equal to a rail: this is the appearance of the black kind\r\nwhich fight with the serpents, but of those which most crowd round men's\r\nfeet (for there are two several kinds of ibises) the head is bare and\r\nalso the whole of the throat, and it is white in feathering except the\r\nhead and neck and the extremities of the wings and the rump (in all\r\nthese parts of which I have spoken it is a deep black), while in legs\r\nand in the form of the head it resembles the other. As for the serpent\r\nits form is like that of the watersnake; and it has wings not feathered\r\nbut most nearly resembling the wings of the bat. Let so much suffice as\r\nhas been said now concerning sacred animals.\r\n\r\n77. Of the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the part of Egypt\r\nwhich is sown for crops 67 practise memory more than any other men and\r\nare the most learned in history by far of all those of whom I have had\r\nexperience: and their manner of life is as follows:—For three successive\r\ndays in each month they purge, hunting after health with emetics and\r\nclysters, and they think that all the diseases which exist are produced\r\nin men by the food on which they live; for the Egyptians are from other\r\ncauses also the most healthy of all men next after the Libyans (in my\r\nopinion on account of the seasons, because the seasons do not change,\r\nfor by the changes of things generally, and especially of the seasons,\r\ndiseases are most apt to be produced in men), and as to their diet, it\r\nis as follows:—they eat bread, making loaves of maize, which they call\r\nkyllestis, and they use habitually a wine made out of barley, for vines\r\nthey have not in their land. Of their fish some they dry in the sun and\r\nthen eat them without cooking, others they eat cured in brine. Of birds\r\nthey eat quails and ducks and small birds without cooking, after first\r\ncuring them; and everything else which they have belonging to the\r\nclass of birds or fishes, except such as have been set apart by them as\r\nsacred, they eat roasted or boiled.\r\n\r\n78. In the entertainments of the rich among them, when they have\r\nfinished eating, a man bears round a wooden figure of a dead body in a\r\ncoffin, made as like the reality as may be both by painting and carving,\r\nand measuring about a cubit or two cubits each way; 68 and this he shows\r\nto each of those who are drinking together, saying: \"When thou lookest\r\nupon this, drink and be merry, for thou shalt be such as this when thou\r\nart dead.\" Thus they do at their carousals.\r\n\r\n79. The customs which they practise are derived from their fathers and\r\nthey do not acquire others in addition; but besides other customary\r\nthings among them which are worthy of mention, they have one song, 6801\r\nthat of Linos, the same who is sung of both in Phenicia and in Cyprus\r\nand elsewhere, having however a name different according to the various\r\nnations. This song agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes sing\r\ncalling on the name of Linos, 69 so that besides many other things\r\nabout which I wonder among those matters which concern Egypt, I wonder\r\nespecially about this, namely whence they got the song of Linos. 70 It\r\nis evident however that they have sung this song from immemorial time,\r\nand in the Egyptian tongue Linos is called Maneros. The Egyptians told\r\nme that he was the only son of him who first became king of Egypt, and\r\nthat he died before his time and was honoured with these lamentations by\r\nthe Egyptians, and that this was their first and only song.\r\n\r\n80. In another respect the Egyptians are in agreement with some of the\r\nHellenes, namely with the Lacedemonians, but not with the rest, that is\r\nto say, the younger of them when they meet the elder give way and move\r\nout of the path, and when their elders approach they rise out of their\r\nseat. In this which follows however they are not in agreement with any\r\nof the Hellenes,—instead of addressing one another in the roads they do\r\nreverence, lowering their hand down to their knee.\r\n\r\n81. They wear tunics of linen about their legs with fringes, which they\r\ncall calasiris; above these they have garments of white wool thrown\r\nover: woollen garments however are not taken into the temples, nor are\r\nthey buried with them, for this is not permitted by religion. In these\r\npoints they are in agreement with the observances called Orphic and\r\nBacchic (which are really Egyptian), 71 and also with those of the\r\nPythagoreans, for one who takes part in these mysteries is also\r\nforbidden by religious rule to be buried in woollen garments; and about\r\nthis there is a sacred story told.\r\n\r\n82. Besides these things the Egyptians have found out also to what god\r\neach month and each day belongs, and what fortunes a man will meet with\r\nwho is born on any particular day, and how he will die, and what kind\r\nof a man he will be: and these inventions were taken up by those of the\r\nHellenes who occupied themselves about poesy. Portents too have been\r\nfound out by them more than by all other men besides; for when a portent\r\nhas happened, they observe and write down the event which comes of it,\r\nand if ever afterwards anything resembling this happens, they believe\r\nthat the event which comes of it will be similar.\r\n\r\n83. Their divination is ordered thus:—the art is assigned not to any\r\nman, but to certain of the gods, for there are in their land Oracles of\r\nHeracles, of Apollo, of Athene, of Artemis, of Ares, and of Zeus, and\r\nmoreover that which they hold most in honour of all, namely the Oracle\r\nof Leto which is in the city of Buto. The manner of divination however\r\nis not yet established among them according to the same fashion\r\neverywhere, but is different in different places.\r\n\r\n84. The art of medicine among them is distributed thus:—each physician\r\nis a physician of one disease and of no more; and the whole country is\r\nfull of physicians, for some profess themselves to be physicians of the\r\neyes, others of the head, others of the teeth, others of the affections\r\nof the stomach, and others of the more obscure ailments.\r\n\r\n85. Their fashions of mourning and of burial are these:—Whenever any\r\nhousehold has lost a man who is of any regard amongst them, the whole\r\nnumber of women of that house forthwith plaster over their heads or even\r\ntheir faces with mud. Then leaving the corpse within the house they go\r\nthemselves to and fro about the city and beat themselves, with their\r\ngarments bound up by a girdle 72 and their breasts exposed, and with\r\nthem go all the women who are related to the dead man, and on the other\r\nside the men beat themselves, they too having their garments bound up by\r\na girdle; and when they have done this, they then convey the body to the\r\nembalming.\r\n\r\n86. In this occupation certain persons employ themselves regularly and\r\ninherit this as a craft. These, whenever a corpse is conveyed to them,\r\nshow to those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality\r\nby painting, and the best of the ways of embalming they say is that of\r\nhim whose name I think it impiety to mention when speaking of a matter\r\nof such a kind; 73 the second which they show is less good than this and\r\nalso less expensive; and the third is the least expensive of all. Having\r\ntold them about this, they inquire of them in which way they desire the\r\ncorpse of their friend to be prepared. Then they after they have agreed\r\nfor a certain price depart out of the way, and the others being left\r\nbehind in the buildings embalm according to the best of these ways\r\nthus:—First with a crooked iron tool they draw out the brain through the\r\nnostrils, extracting it partly thus and partly by pouring in drugs; and\r\nafter this with a sharp stone of Ethiopia they make a cut along the side\r\nand take out the whole contents of the belly, and when they have cleared\r\nout the cavity and cleansed it with palm-wine they cleanse it again with\r\nspices pounded up: then they fill the belly with pure myrrh pounded\r\nup and with cassia and other spices except frankincense, and sew it\r\ntogether again. Having so done they keep it for embalming covered up\r\nin natron for seventy days, but for a longer time than this it is not\r\npermitted to embalm it; and when the seventy days are past, they wash\r\nthe corpse and roll its whole body up in fine linen 74 cut into bands,\r\nsmearing these beneath with gum, 75 which the Egyptians use generally\r\ninstead of glue. Then the kinsfolk receive it from them and have a\r\nwooden figure made in the shape of a man, and when they have had this\r\nmade they enclose the corpse, and having shut it up within, they store\r\nit then in a sepulchral chamber, setting it to stand upright against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n87. Thus they deal with the corpses which are prepared in the most\r\ncostly way; but for those who desire the middle way and wish to avoid\r\ngreat cost they prepare the corpse as follows:—having filled their\r\nsyringes with the oil which is got from cedar-wood, with this they\r\nforthwith fill the belly of the corpse, and this they do without having\r\neither cut it open or taken out the bowels, but they inject the oil by\r\nthe breech, and having stopped the drench from returning back they keep\r\nit then the appointed number of days for embalming, and on the last\r\nof the days they let the cedar oil come out from the belly, which they\r\nbefore put in; and it has such power that it brings out with it the\r\nbowels and interior organs of the body dissolved; and the natron\r\ndissolves the flesh, so that there is left of the corpse only the skin\r\nand the bones. When they have done this they give back the corpse at\r\nonce in that condition without working upon it any more.\r\n\r\n88. The third kind of embalming, by which are prepared the bodies of\r\nthose who have less means, is as follows:—they cleanse out the belly\r\nwith a purge and then keep the body for embalming during the seventy\r\ndays, and at once after that they give it back to the bringers to carry\r\naway.\r\n\r\n89. The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be\r\nembalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard\r\nthan others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and\r\nnot before) they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this\r\nmatter in order that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they\r\nsay that one of them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman\r\nlately dead, and his fellow-craftsman gave information.\r\n\r\n90. Whenever any one, either of the Egyptians themselves or of\r\nstrangers, is found to have been carried off by a crocodile or brought\r\nto his death by the river itself, the people of any city by which he may\r\nhave been cast up on land must embalm him and lay him out in the fairest\r\nway they can and bury him in a sacred burial-place, nor may any of his\r\nrelations or friends besides touch him, but the priests of the Nile\r\nthemselves handle the corpse and bury it as that of one who was\r\nsomething more than man.\r\n\r\n91. Hellenic usages they will by no means follow, and to speak generally\r\nthey follow those of no other men whatever. This rule is observed by\r\nmost of the Egyptians; but there is a large city named Chemmis in the\r\nTheban district near Neapolis, and in this city there is a temple of\r\nPerseus the son of Danae which is of a square shape, and round it grow\r\ndate-palms: the gateway of the temple is built of stone and of very\r\ngreat size, and at the entrance of it stand two great statues of stone.\r\nWithin this enclosure is a temple-house 76 and in it stands an image\r\nof Perseus. These people of Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to\r\nappear in their land and often within the temple, and that a sandal\r\nwhich has been worn by him is found sometimes, being in length two\r\ncubits, and whenever this appears all Egypt prospers. This they say, and\r\nthey do in honour of Perseus after Hellenic fashion thus,—they hold an\r\nathletic contest, which includes the whole list of games, and they offer\r\nin prizes cattle and cloaks and skins: and when I inquired why to them\r\nalone Perseus was wont to appear, and wherefore they were separated from\r\nall the other Egyptians in that they held an athletic contest, they said\r\nthat Perseus had been born of their city, for Danaos and Lynkeus were\r\nmen of Chemmis and had sailed to Hellas, and from them they traced a\r\ndescent and came down to Perseus: and they told me that he had come to\r\nEgypt for the reason which the Hellenes also say, namely to bring from\r\nLibya the Gorgon's head, and had then visited them also and recognised\r\nall his kinsfolk, and they said that he had well learnt the name of\r\nChemmis before he came to Egypt, since he had heard it from his mother,\r\nand that they celebrated an athletic contest for him by his own command.\r\n\r\n92. All these are customs practised by the Egyptians who dwell above the\r\nfens: and those who are settled in the fen-land have the same customs\r\nfor the most part as the other Egyptians, both in other matters and also\r\nin that they live each with one wife only, as do the Hellenes; but for\r\neconomy in respect of food they have invented these things besides:—when\r\nthe river has become full and the plains have been flooded, there grow\r\nin the water great numbers of lilies, which the Egyptians call lotos;\r\nthese they cut with a sickle and dry in the sun, and then they pound\r\nthat which grows in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head\r\nof a poppy, and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root also\r\nof this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: 77 it is round\r\nin shape and about the size of an apple. There are other lilies too, in\r\nflower resembling roses, which also grow in the river, and from them the\r\nfruit is produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the\r\nside of the plant itself, and very nearly resembles a wasp's comb:\r\nin this there grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an\r\nolive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh 78 or dried. Besides this\r\nthey pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every year, and the\r\nupper parts of it they cut off and turn to other uses, but that which is\r\nleft below for about a cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who\r\ndesire to have the papyrus at its very best bake it in an oven heated\r\nred-hot, and then eat it. Some too of these people live on fish alone,\r\nwhich they dry in the sun after having caught them and taken out the\r\nentrails, and then when they are dry, they use them for food.\r\n\r\n93. Fish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the rivers, but\r\nare bred in the lakes, and they do as follows:—When there comes upon\r\nthem the desire to breed, they swim out in shoals towards the sea; and\r\nthe males lead the way shedding forth their milt as they go, while the\r\nfemales, coming after and swallowing it up, from it become impregnated:\r\nand when they have become full of young in the sea they swim up back\r\nagain, each shoal to its own haunts. The same however no longer lead the\r\nway as before, but the lead comes now to the females, and they leading\r\nthe way in shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed\r\nforth their eggs by a few grains at a time, 79 and the males coming\r\nafter swallow them up. Now these grains are fish, and from the grains\r\nwhich survive and are not swallowed, the fish grow which afterwards are\r\nbred up. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out to sea\r\nare found to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which are\r\ncaught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This happens\r\nto them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to the land\r\non the left side of the river, and again as they swim up they keep to\r\nthe same side, approaching and touching the bank as much as they can,\r\nfor fear doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the\r\nstream. When the Nile begins to swell, the hollow places of the land\r\nand the depressions by the side of the river first begin to fill, as the\r\nwater soaks through from the river, and so soon as they become full of\r\nwater, at once they are all filled with little fishes; and whence\r\nthese are in all likelihood produced, I think that I perceive. In the\r\npreceding year, when the Nile goes down, the fish first lay eggs in the\r\nmud and then retire with the last of the retreating waters; and when\r\nthe time comes round again, and the water once more comes over the land,\r\nfrom these eggs forthwith are produced the fishes of which I speak.\r\n\r\n94. Thus it is as regards the fish. And for anointing those of the\r\nEgyptians who dwell in the fens use oil from the castor-berry, 80 which\r\noil the Egyptians call kiki, and thus they do:—they sow along the banks\r\nof the rivers and pools these plants, which in a wild form grow of\r\nthemselves in the land of the Hellenes; these are sown in Egypt and\r\nproduce berries in great quantity but of an evil smell; and when they\r\nhave gathered these, some cut them up and press the oil from them,\r\nothers again roast them first and then boil them down and collect that\r\nwhich runs away from them. The oil is fat and not less suitable for\r\nburning than olive-oil, but it gives forth a disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\n95. Against the gnats, which are very abundant, they have contrived as\r\nfollows:—those who dwell above the fen-land are helped by the towers, to\r\nwhich they ascend when they go to rest; for the gnats by reason of the\r\nwinds are not able to fly up high: but those who dwell in the fen-land\r\nhave contrived another way instead of the towers, and this is it:—every\r\nman of them has got a casting net, with which by day he catches fish,\r\nbut in the night he uses it for this purpose, that is to say he puts the\r\ncasting-net round about the bed in which he sleeps, and then creeps in\r\nunder it and goes to sleep: and the gnats, if he sleeps rolled up in a\r\ngarment or a linen sheet, bite through these, but through the net they\r\ndo not even attempt to bite.\r\n\r\n96. Their boats with which they carry cargoes are made of the thorny\r\nacacia, of which the form is very like that of the Kyrenian lotos, and\r\nthat which exudes from it is gum. From this tree they cut pieces of wood\r\nabout two cubits in length and arrange them like bricks, fastening\r\nthe boat together by running a great number of long bolts through the\r\ntwo-cubit pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together,\r\nthey lay cross-pieces 81 over the top, using no ribs for the sides; and\r\nwithin they caulk the seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for\r\nit, which is passed through the bottom of the boat; and they have a mast\r\nof acacia and sails of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river\r\nunless there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed from the shore:\r\ndown-stream however they travel as follows:—they have a door-shaped\r\ncrate made of tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together, and also a\r\nstone of about two talents weight bored with a hole; and of these the\r\nboatman lets the crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a\r\nrope, and the stone drag behind by another rope. The crate then, as the\r\nforce of the stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly and draws on the\r\nbaris (for so these boats are called), while the stone dragging after it\r\nbehind and sunk deep in the water keeps its course straight. These boats\r\nthey have in great numbers and some of them carry many thousands of\r\ntalents' burden.\r\n\r\n97. When the Nile comes over the land, the cities alone are seen rising\r\nabove the water, resembling more nearly than anything else the islands\r\nin the Egean sea; for the rest of Egypt becomes a sea and the cities\r\nalone rise above water. Accordingly, whenever this happens, they pass\r\nby water not now by the channels of the river but over the midst of\r\nthe plain: for example, as one sails up from Naucratis to Memphis the\r\npassage is then close by the pyramids, whereas the usual passage is not\r\nthe same even here, 82 but goes by the point of the Delta and the city\r\nof Kercasoros; while if you sail over the plain to Naucratis from the\r\nsea and from Canobos, you will go by Anthylla and the city called after\r\nArchander.\r\n\r\n98. Of these Anthylla is a city of note and is especially assigned to\r\nthe wife of him who reigns over Egypt, to supply her with sandals, (this\r\nis the case since the time when Egypt came to be under the Persians):\r\nthe other city seems to me to have its name from Archander the\r\nson-in-law of Danaos, who was the son of Phthios, the son of Achaios;\r\nfor it is called the City of Archander. There might indeed be another\r\nArchander, but in any case the name is not Egyptian.\r\n\r\n99. Hitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry are the\r\nvouchers for that which I have said; but from this point onwards I am\r\nabout to tell the history of Egypt according to that which I heard, to\r\nwhich will be added also something of that which I have myself seen.\r\n\r\nOf Min, who first became king of Egypt, the priests said that on the\r\none hand he banked off the site of Memphis from the river: for the whole\r\nstream of the river used to flow along by the sandy mountain-range on\r\nthe side of Libya, but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river\r\nwhich lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above Memphis, and thus\r\nhe dried up the old stream and conducted the river so that it flowed in\r\nthe middle between the mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is\r\nby the Persians kept under very careful watch, that it may flow in the\r\nchannel to which it is confined, 83 and the bank is repaired every year;\r\nfor if the river should break through and overflow in this direction,\r\nMemphis would be in danger of being overwhelmed by flood. When this Min,\r\nwho first became king, had made into dry land the part which was dammed\r\noff, on the one hand, I say, he founded in it that city which is now\r\ncalled Memphis; for Memphis too is in the narrow part of Egypt; 84\r\nand outside the city he dug round it on the North and West a lake\r\ncommunicating with the river, for the side towards the East is barred by\r\nthe Nile itself. Then secondly he established in the city the temple of\r\nHephaistos a great work and most worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n100. After this man the priests enumerated to me from a papyrus roll\r\nthe names of other kings, three hundred and thirty in number; and in all\r\nthese generations of men eighteen were Ethiopians, one was a woman, a\r\nnative Egyptian, and the rest were men and of Egyptian race: and the\r\nname of the woman who reigned was the same as that of the Babylonian\r\nqueen, namely Nitocris. Of her they said that desiring to take vengeance\r\nfor her brother, whom the Egyptians had slain when he was their king and\r\nthen, after having slain him, had given his kingdom to her,—desiring,\r\nI say, to take vengeance for him, she destroyed by craft many of the\r\nEgyptians. For she caused to be constructed a very large chamber under\r\nground, and making as though she would handsel it but in her mind\r\ndevising other things, she invited those of the Egyptians whom she knew\r\nto have had most part in the murder, and gave a great banquet. Then\r\nwhile they were feasting, she let in the river upon them by a secret\r\nconduit of large size. Of her they told no more than this, except that,\r\nwhen this had been accomplished, she threw herself into a room full of\r\nembers, in order that she might escape vengeance.\r\n\r\n101. As for the other kings, they could tell me of no great works which\r\nhad been produced by them, and they said that they had no renown 85\r\nexcept only the last of them, Moris: he (they said) produced as a\r\nmemorial of himself the gateway of the temple of Hephaistos which is\r\nturned towards the North Wind, and dug a lake, about which I shall set\r\nforth afterwards how many furlongs of circuit it has, and in it built\r\npyramids of the size which I shall mention at the same time when I speak\r\nof the lake itself. He, they said, produced these works, but of the rest\r\nnone produced any.\r\n\r\n102. Therefore passing these by I shall make mention of the king who\r\ncame after these, whose name was Sesostris. He (the priests said) first\r\nof all set out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those\r\nwho dwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea, until as he sailed he\r\ncame to a sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals:\r\nthen secondly, after he had returned to Egypt, according to the report\r\nof the priests he took a great army 86 and marched over the continent,\r\nsubduing every nation which stood in his way: and those of them whom he\r\nfound valiant and fighting desperately for their freedom, in their lands\r\nhe set up pillars which told by inscriptions his own name and the name\r\nof his country, and how he had subdued them by his power; but as to\r\nthose of whose cities he obtained possession without fighting or with\r\nease, on their pillars he inscribed words after the same tenor as he did\r\nfor the nations which had shown themselves courageous, and in addition\r\nhe drew upon them the hidden parts of a woman, desiring to signify by\r\nthis that the people were cowards and effeminate.\r\n\r\n103. Thus doing he traversed the continent, until at last he passed over\r\nto Europe from Asia and subdued the Scythians and also the Thracians.\r\nThese, I am of opinion, were the furthest 87 people to which the\r\nEgyptian army came, for in their country the pillars are found to have\r\nbeen set up, but in the land beyond this they are no longer found. From\r\nthis point he turned and began to go back; and when he came to the river\r\nPhasis, what happened then I cannot say for certain, whether the king\r\nSesostris himself divided off a certain portion of his army and left the\r\nmen there as settlers in the land, or whether some of his soldiers were\r\nwearied by his distant marches and remained by the river Phasis.\r\n\r\n104. For the people of Colchis are evidently Egyptian, and this I\r\nperceived for myself before I heard it from others. So when I had\r\ncome to consider the matter I asked them both; and the Colchians had\r\nremembrance of the Egyptians more than the Egyptians of the Colchians;\r\nbut the Egyptians said they believed that the Colchians were a portion\r\nof the army of Sesostris. That this was so I conjectured myself not\r\nonly because they are dark-skinned and have curly hair (this of itself\r\namounts to nothing, for there are other races which are so), but also\r\nstill more because the Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians alone of\r\nall the races of men have practised circumcision from the first. The\r\nPhenicians and the Syrians 88 who dwell in Palestine confess themselves\r\nthat they have learnt it from the Egyptians, and the Syrians 89 about\r\nthe river Thermodon and the river Parthenios, and the Macronians, who\r\nare their neighbours, say that they have learnt it lately from the\r\nColchians. These are the only races of men who practise circumcision,\r\nand these evidently practise it in the same manner as the Egyptians. Of\r\nthe Egyptians themselves however and the Ethiopians, I am not able to\r\nsay which learnt from the other, for undoubtedly it is a most ancient\r\ncustom; but that the other nations learnt it by intercourse with the\r\nEgyptians, this among others is to me a strong proof, namely that those\r\nof the Phenicians who have intercourse with Hellas cease to follow the\r\nexample of the Egyptians in this matter, and do not circumcise their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n105. Now let me tell another thing about the Colchians to show how they\r\nresemble the Egyptians:—they alone work flax in the same fashion as the\r\nEgyptians, 90 and the two nations are like one another in their whole\r\nmanner of living and also in their language: now the linen of Colchis\r\nis called by the Hellenes Sardonic, whereas that from Egypt is called\r\nEgyptian.\r\n\r\n106. The pillars which Sesostris of Egypt set up in the various\r\ncountries are for the most part no longer to be seen extant; but in\r\nSyria Palestine I myself saw them existing with the inscription upon\r\nthem which I have mentioned and the emblem. Moreover in Ionia there are\r\ntwo figures of this man carved upon rocks, one on the road by which one\r\ngoes from the land of Ephesos to Phocaia, and the other on the road from\r\nSardis to Smyrna. In each place there is a figure of a man cut in the\r\nrock, of four cubits and a span in height, holding in his right hand a\r\nspear and in his left a bow and arrows, and the other equipment which he\r\nhas is similar to this, for it is both Egyptian and Ethiopian: and from\r\nthe one shoulder to the other across the breast runs an inscription\r\ncarved in sacred Egyptian characters, saying thus, \"This land with my\r\nshoulders I won for myself.\" But who he is and from whence, he does not\r\ndeclare in these places, though in other places he has declared this.\r\nSome of those who have seen these carvings conjecture that the figure is\r\nthat of Memnon, but herein they are very far from the truth.\r\n\r\n107. As this Egyptian Sesostris was returning and bringing back many\r\nmen of the nations whose lands he had subdued, when he came (said the\r\npriests) to Daphnai in the district of Pelusion on his journey home, his\r\nbrother to whom Sesostris had entrusted the charge of Egypt invited him\r\nand with him his sons to a feast; and then he piled the house round\r\nwith brushwood and set it on fire: and Sesostris when he discovered this\r\nforthwith took counsel with his wife, for he was bringing with him (they\r\nsaid) his wife also; and she counselled him to lay out upon the pyre two\r\nof his sons, which were six in number, and so to make a bridge over\r\nthe burning mass, and that they passing over their bodies should thus\r\nescape. This, they said, Sesostris did, and two of his sons were burnt\r\nto death in this manner, but the rest got away safe with their father.\r\n\r\n108. Then Sesostris, having returned to Egypt and having taken vengeance\r\non his brother, employed the multitude which he had brought in of those\r\nwhose lands he had subdued, as follows:—these were they who drew the\r\nstones which in the reign of this king were brought to the temple of\r\nHephaistos, being of very great size; and also these were compelled to\r\ndig all the channels which now are in Egypt; and thus (having no such\r\npurpose) they caused Egypt, which before was all fit for riding and\r\ndriving, to be no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for from that\r\ntime forward Egypt, though it is plain land, has become all unfit for\r\nriding and driving, and the cause has been these channels, which are\r\nmany and run in all directions. But the reason why the king cut up\r\nthe land was this, namely because those of the Egyptians who had their\r\ncities not on the river but in the middle of the country, being in want\r\nof water when the river went down from them, found their drink brackish\r\nbecause they had it from wells.\r\n\r\n109. For this reason Egypt was cut up; and they said that this king\r\ndistributed the land to all the Egyptians, giving an equal square\r\nportion to each man, and from this he made his revenue, having appointed\r\nthem to pay a certain rent every year: and if the river should take away\r\nanything from any man's portion, he would come to the king and declare\r\nthat which had happened, and the king used to send men to examine and to\r\nfind out by measurement how much less the piece of land had become, in\r\norder that for the future the man might pay less, in proportion to the\r\nrent appointed: and I think that thus the art of geometry was found out\r\nand afterwards came into Hellas also. For as touching the sun-dial 91\r\nand the gnomon 92 and the twelve divisions of the day, they were learnt\r\nby the Hellenes from the Babylonians.\r\n\r\n110. He moreover alone of all the Egyptian kings had rule over Ethiopia;\r\nand he left as memorials of himself in front of the temple of Hephaistos\r\ntwo stone statues of thirty cubits each, representing himself and his\r\nwife, and others of twenty cubits each representing his four sons: and\r\nlong afterwards the priest of Hephaistos refused to permit Dareios the\r\nPersian to set up a statue of himself in front of them, saying that\r\ndeeds had not been done by him equal to those which were done by\r\nSesostris the Egyptian; for Sesostris had subdued other nations besides,\r\nnot fewer than he, and also the Scythians; but Dareios had not been able\r\nto conquer the Scythians: wherefore it was not just that he should set\r\nup a statue in front of those which Sesostris had dedicated, if he did\r\nnot surpass him in his deeds. Which speech, they say, Dareios took in\r\ngood part.\r\n\r\n111. Now after Sesostris had brought his life to an end, his son Pheros,\r\nthey told me, received in succession the kingdom, and he made no warlike\r\nexpedition, and moreover it chanced to him to become blind by reason of\r\nthe following accident:—when the river had come down in flood rising to\r\na height of eighteen cubits, higher than ever before that time, and had\r\ngone over the fields, a wind fell upon it and the river became agitated\r\nby waves: and this king (they say) moved by presumptuous folly took\r\na spear and cast it into the midst of the eddies of the stream; and\r\nimmediately upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made\r\nblind. For ten years then he was blind, and in the eleventh year there\r\ncame to him an oracle from the city of Buto saying that the time of his\r\npunishment had expired, and that he should see again if he washed his\r\neyes with the water of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband\r\nonly and had not knowledge of other men: and first he made trial of his\r\nown wife, and then, as he continued blind, he went on to try all the\r\nwomen in turn; and when he had at last regained his sight he gathered\r\ntogether all the women of whom he had made trial, excepting her by\r\nwhose means he had regained his sight, to one city which now is named\r\nErythrabolos, 93 and having gathered them to this he consumed them all\r\nby fire, as well as the city itself; but as for her by whose means he\r\nhad regained his sight, he had her himself to wife. Then after he had\r\nescaped the malady of his eyes he dedicated offerings at each one of the\r\ntemples which were of renown, and especially (to mention only that which\r\nis most worthy of mention) he dedicated at the temple of the Sun works\r\nwhich are worth seeing, namely two obelisks of stone, each of a single\r\nblock, measuring in length a hundred cubits each one and in breadth\r\neight cubits.\r\n\r\n112. After him, they said, there succeeded to the throne a man of\r\nMemphis, whose name in the tongue of the Hellenes was Proteus; for whom\r\nthere is now a sacred enclosure at Memphis, very fair and well ordered,\r\nlying on that side of the temple of Hephaistos which faces the North\r\nWind. Round about this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre, and this\r\nwhole region is called the Camp of the Tyrians. 94 Within the enclosure\r\nof Proteus there is a temple called the temple of the \"foreign\r\nAphrodite,\" which temple I conjecture to be one of Helen the daughter of\r\nTyndareus, not only because I have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with\r\nProteus, but also especially because it is called by the name of the\r\n\"foreign Aphrodite,\" for the other temples of Aphrodite which there are\r\nhave none of them the addition of the word \"foreign\" to the name.\r\n\r\n113. And the priests told me, when I inquired, that the things\r\nconcerning Helen happened thus:—Alexander having carried off Helen was\r\nsailing away from Sparta to his own land, and when he had come to the\r\nEgean Sea contrary winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt;\r\nand after that, since the blasts did not cease to blow, he came to Egypt\r\nitself, and in Egypt to that which is now named the Canobic mouth of the\r\nNile and to Taricheiai. Now there was upon the shore, as still there is\r\nnow, a temple of Heracles, in which if any man's slave take refuge and\r\nhave the sacred marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god, it\r\nis not lawful to lay hands upon him; and this custom has continued\r\nstill unchanged from the beginning down to my own time. Accordingly the\r\nattendants of Alexander, having heard of the custom which existed about\r\nthe temple, ran away from him, and sitting down as suppliants of the\r\ngod, accused Alexander, because they desired to do him hurt, telling\r\nthe whole tale how things were about Helen and about the wrong done to\r\nMenelaos; and this accusation they made not only to the priests but also\r\nto the warden of this river-mouth, whose name was Thonis.\r\n\r\n114. Thonis then having heard their tale sent forthwith a message to\r\nProteus at Memphis, which said as follows: \"There hath come a stranger,\r\na Teucrian by race, who hath done in Hellas an unholy deed; for he hath\r\ndeceived the wife of his own host, and is come hither bringing with him\r\nthis woman herself and very much wealth, having been carried out of\r\nhis way by winds to thy land. 95 Shall we then allow him to sail out\r\nunharmed, or shall we first take away from him that which he brought\r\nwith him?\" In reply to this Proteus sent back a messenger who said thus:\r\n\"Seize this man, whosoever he may be, who has done impiety to his own\r\nhost, and bring him away into my presence, that I may know what he will\r\nfind to say.\"\r\n\r\n115. Hearing this, Thonis seized Alexander and detained his ships, and\r\nafter that he brought the man himself up to Memphis and with him Helen\r\nand the wealth he had, and also in addition to them the suppliants. So\r\nwhen all had been conveyed up thither, Proteus began to ask Alexander\r\nwho he was and from whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted to\r\nhim his descent and told him the name of his native land, and moreover\r\nrelated of his voyage, from whence he was sailing. After this Proteus\r\nasked him whence he had taken Helen; and when Alexander went astray in\r\nhis account and did not speak the truth, those who had become suppliants\r\nconvicted him of falsehood, relating in full the whole tale of the wrong\r\ndone. At length Proteus declared to them this sentence, saying, \"Were\r\nit not that I count it a matter of great moment not to slay any of those\r\nstrangers who being driven from their course by winds have come to my\r\nland hitherto, I should have taken vengeance on thee on behalf of the\r\nman of Hellas, seeing that thou, most base of men, having received from\r\nhim hospitality, didst work against him a most impious deed. For thou\r\ndidst go in to the wife of thine own host; and even this was not enough\r\nfor thee, but thou didst stir her up with desire and hast gone away with\r\nher like a thief. Moreover not even this by itself was enough for thee,\r\nbut thou art come hither with plunder taken from the house of thy host.\r\nNow therefore depart, seeing that I have counted it of great moment not\r\nto be a slayer of strangers. This woman indeed and the wealth which thou\r\nhast I will not allow thee to carry away, but I shall keep them safe for\r\nthe Hellene who was thy host, until he come himself and desire to carry\r\nthem off to his home; to thyself however and thy fellow-voyagers I\r\nproclaim that ye depart from your anchoring within three days and go\r\nfrom my land to some other; and if not, that ye will be dealt with as\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\n116. This the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus;\r\nand I suppose that Homer also had heard this story, but since it was\r\nnot so suitable to the composition of his poem as the other which he\r\nfollowed, he dismissed it finally, 96 making it clear at the same time\r\nthat he was acquainted with that story also: and according to the manner\r\nin which he described 97 the wanderings of Alexander in the Iliad (nor\r\ndid he elsewhere retract that which he had said) it is clear that when\r\nhe brought Helen he was carried out of his course, wandering to various\r\nlands, and that he came among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this\r\nthe poet has made mention in the \"prowess of Diomede,\" and the verses\r\nrun this: 98\r\n\r\n\r\n \"There she had robes many-coloured, the works of women of Sidon,\r\n  Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander\r\n  Carried from Sidon, what time the broad sea-path he sailed over\r\n  Bringing back Helene home, of a noble father begotten.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these verses: 99\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Such had the daughter of Zeus, such drugs of exquisite cunning,\r\n  Good, which to her the wife of Thon, Polydamna, had given,\r\n  Dwelling in Egypt, the land where the bountiful meadow produces\r\n  Drugs more than all lands else, many good being mixed, many evil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos: 100\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Still the gods stayed me in Egypt, to come back hither desiring,\r\n  Stayed me from voyaging home, since sacrifice was due I performed not.\"\r\n\r\nIn these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wandering of\r\nAlexander to Egypt, for Syria borders upon Egypt and the Phenicians, of\r\nwhom is Sidon, dwell in Syria.\r\n\r\n117. By these lines and by this passage 101 it is also most clearly\r\nshown that the \"Cyprian Epic\" was not written by Homer but by some other\r\nman: for in this it is said that on the third day after leaving\r\nSparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him Helen, having had a\r\n\"gently-blowing wind and a smooth sea,\" whereas in the Iliad it says\r\nthat he wandered from his course when he brought her.\r\n\r\n118. Let us now leave Homer and the \"Cyprian\" Epic; but this I will say,\r\nnamely that I asked the priests whether it is but an idle tale which\r\nthe Hellenes tell of that which they say happened about Ilion; and they\r\nanswered me thus, saying that they had their knowledge by inquiries from\r\nMenelaos himself. After the rape of Helen there came indeed, they said,\r\nto the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help Menelaos; and\r\nwhen the army had come out of the ships to land and had pitched its\r\ncamp there, they sent messengers to Ilion, with whom went also Menelaos\r\nhimself; and when these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen\r\nand the wealth which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos and had taken\r\naway; and moreover they demanded satisfaction for the wrongs done: and\r\nthe Teucrians told the same tale then and afterwards, both with oath and\r\nwithout oath, namely that in deed and in truth they had not Helen nor\r\nthe wealth for which demand was made, but that both were in Egypt; and\r\nthat they could not justly be compelled to give satisfaction for that\r\nwhich Proteus the king of Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that\r\nthey were being mocked by them and besieged the city, until at last they\r\ntook it; and when they had taken the wall and did not find Helen, but\r\nheard the same tale as before, then they believed the former tale and\r\nsent Menelaos himself to Proteus.\r\n\r\n119. And Menelaos having come to Egypt and having sailed up to Memphis,\r\ntold the truth of these matters, and not only found great entertainment,\r\nbut also received Helen unhurt, and all his own wealth besides. Then\r\nhowever, after he had been thus dealt with, Menelaos showed himself\r\nungrateful to the Egyptians; for when he set forth to sail away,\r\ncontrary winds detained him, and as this condition of things lasted\r\nlong, he devised an impious deed; for he took two children of natives\r\nand made sacrifice of them. After this, when it was known that he had\r\ndone so, he became abhorred, and being pursued he escaped and got away\r\nin his ships to Libya; but whither he went besides after this, the\r\nEgyptians were not able to tell. Of these things they said that they\r\nfound out part by inquiries, and the rest, namely that which happened in\r\ntheir own land, they related from sure and certain knowledge.\r\n\r\n120. Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me; and I myself also agree\r\nwith the story which was told of Helen, adding this consideration,\r\nnamely that if Helen had been in Ilion she would have been given up to\r\nthe Hellenes, whether Alexander consented or no; for Priam assuredly was\r\nnot so mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desirous to\r\nrun risk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city, in\r\norder that Alexander might have Helen as his wife: and even supposing\r\nthat during the first part of the time they had been so inclined, yet\r\nwhen many others of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as\r\noften as they fought with the Hellenes, and of the sons of Priam himself\r\nalways two or three or even more were slain when a battle took place (if\r\none may trust at all to the Epic poets),—when, I say, things were coming\r\nthus to pass, I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his\r\nwife, he would have given her back to the Achaians, if at least by so\r\ndoing he might be freed from the evils which oppressed him. Nor even\r\nwas the kingdom coming to Alexander next, so that when Priam was old the\r\ngovernment was in his hands; but Hector, who was both older and more of\r\na man than he, would have received it after the death of Priam; and\r\nhim it behoved not to allow his brother to go on with his wrong-doing,\r\nconsidering that great evils were coming to pass on his account both to\r\nhimself privately and in general to the other Trojans. In truth however\r\nthey lacked the power to give Helen back; and the Hellenes did not\r\nbelieve them, though they spoke the truth; because, as I declare my\r\nopinion, the divine power was purposing to cause them utterly to perish,\r\nand so make it evident to men that for great wrongs great also are the\r\nchastisements which come from the gods. And thus have I delivered my\r\nopinion concerning these matters.\r\n\r\n121. After Proteus, they told me, Rhampsinitos received in succession\r\nthe kingdom, who left as a memorial of himself that gateway to the\r\ntemple of Hephaistos which is turned towards the West, and in front of\r\nthe gateway he set up two statues, in height five-and-twenty cubits, of\r\nwhich the one which stands on the North side is called by the Egyptians\r\nSummer and the one on the South side Winter; and to that one which they\r\ncall Summer they do reverence and make offerings, while to the other\r\nwhich is called Winter they do the opposite of these things. (a) This\r\nking, they said, got great wealth of silver, which none of the kings\r\nborn after him could surpass or even come near to; and wishing to store\r\nhis wealth in safety he caused to be built a chamber of stone, one of\r\nthe walls whereof was towards the outside of his palace: and the builder\r\nof this, having a design against it, contrived as follows, that is, he\r\ndisposed one of the stones in such a manner that it could be taken\r\nout easily from the wall either by two men or even by one. So when the\r\nchamber was finished, the king stored his money in it, and after some\r\ntime the builder, being near the end of his life, called to him his sons\r\n(for he had two) and to them he related how he had contrived in building\r\nthe treasury of the king, and all in forethought for them, that they\r\nmight have ample means of living. And when he had clearly set forth to\r\nthem everything concerning the taking out of the stone, he gave them the\r\nmeasurements, saying that if they paid heed to this matter they would be\r\nstewards of the king's treasury. So he ended his life, and his sons made\r\nno long delay in setting to work, but went to the palace by night, and\r\nhaving found the stone in the wall of the chamber they dealt with it\r\neasily and carried forth for themselves great quantity of the wealth\r\nwithin. (b) And the king happening to open the chamber, he marvelled\r\nwhen he saw the vessels falling short of the full amount, and he did not\r\nknow on whom he should lay the blame, since the seals were unbroken and\r\nthe chamber had been close shut; but when upon his opening the chamber\r\na second and a third time the money was each time seen to be diminished,\r\nfor the thieves did not slacken in their assaults upon it, he did as\r\nfollows:—having ordered traps to be made he set these round about the\r\nvessels in which the money was; and when the thieves had come as at\r\nformer times and one of them had entered, then so soon as he came near\r\nto one of the vessels he was straightway caught in the trap: and when he\r\nperceived in what evil case he was, straightway calling his brother\r\nhe showed him what the matter was, and bade him enter as quickly as\r\npossible and cut off his head, for fear lest being seen and known he\r\nmight bring about the destruction of his brother also. And to the other\r\nit seemed that he spoke well, and he was persuaded and did so; and\r\nfitting the stone into its place he departed home bearing with him the\r\nhead of his brother. (c) Now when it became day, the king entered into\r\nthe chamber and was very greatly amazed, seeing the body of the thief\r\nheld in the trap without his head, and the chamber unbroken, with no way\r\nto come in or go out: and being at a loss he hung up the dead body of\r\nthe thief upon the wall and set guards there, with charge if they saw\r\nany one weeping or bewailing himself to seize him and bring him before\r\nthe king. And when the dead body had been hung up, the mother was\r\ngreatly grieved, and speaking with the son who survived she enjoined\r\nhim, in whatever way he could, to contrive means by which he might\r\ntake down and bring home the body of his dead brother; and if he should\r\nneglect to do this, she earnestly threatened that she would go and give\r\ninformation to the king that he had the money. (d) So as the mother\r\ndealt hardly with the surviving son, and he though saying many things\r\nto her did not persuade her, he contrived for his purpose a device as\r\nfollows:—Providing himself with asses he filled some skins with wine and\r\nlaid them upon the asses, and after that he drove them along: and when\r\nhe came opposite to those who were guarding the corpse hung up, he drew\r\ntowards him two or three of the necks 102 of the skins and loosened the\r\ncords with which they were tied. Then when the wine was running out,\r\nhe began to beat his head and cry out loudly, as if he did not know to\r\nwhich of the asses he should first turn; and when the guards saw the\r\nwine flowing out in streams, they ran together to the road with drinking\r\nvessels in their hands and collected the wine that was poured out,\r\ncounting it so much gain; and he abused them all violently, making as if\r\nhe were angry, but when the guards tried to appease him, after a time\r\nhe feigned to be pacified and to abate his anger, and at length he drove\r\nhis asses out of the road and began to set their loads right. Then more\r\ntalk arose among them, and one or two of them made jests at him and\r\nbrought him to laugh with them; and in the end he made them a present of\r\none of the skins in addition to what they had. Upon that they lay down\r\nthere without more ado, being minded to drink, and they took him into\r\ntheir company and invited him to remain with them and join them in their\r\ndrinking: so he (as may be supposed) was persuaded and stayed. Then as\r\nthey in their drinking bade him welcome in a friendly manner, he made\r\na present to them also of another of the skins; and so at length having\r\ndrunk liberally the guards became completely intoxicated; and being\r\novercome by sleep they went to bed on the spot where they had been\r\ndrinking. He then, as it was now far on in the night, first took down\r\nthe body of his brother, and then in mockery shaved the right cheeks of\r\nall the guards; and after that he put the dead body upon the asses and\r\ndrove them away home, having accomplished that which was enjoined him by\r\nhis mother. (e) Upon this the king, when it was reported to him that the\r\ndead body of the thief had been stolen away, displayed great anger; and\r\ndesiring by all means that it should be found out who it might be who\r\ndevised these things, did this (so at least they said, but I do not\r\nbelieve the account),—he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews,\r\nand enjoined her to receive all equally, and before having commerce with\r\nany one to compel him to tell her what was the most cunning and what the\r\nmost unholy deed which had been done by him in all his life-time; and\r\nwhosoever should relate that which had happened about the thief, him she\r\nmust seize and not let him go out. Then as she was doing that which was\r\nenjoined by her father, the thief, hearing for what purpose this was\r\ndone and having a desire to get the better of the king in resource,\r\ndid thus:—from the body of one lately dead he cut off the arm at the\r\nshoulder and went with it under his mantle: and having gone in to the\r\ndaughter of the king, and being asked that which the others also were\r\nasked, he related that he had done the most unholy deed when he cut off\r\nthe head of his brother, who had been caught in a trap in the king's\r\ntreasure-chamber, and the most cunning deed in that he made drunk the\r\nguards and took down the dead body of his brother hanging up; and she\r\nwhen she heard it tried to take hold of him, but the thief held out to\r\nher in the darkness the arm of the corpse, which she grasped and held,\r\nthinking that she was holding the arm of the man himself; but the thief\r\nleft it in her hands and departed, escaping through the door. (f) Now\r\nwhen this also was reported to the king, he was at first amazed at the\r\nready invention and daring of the fellow, and then afterwards he sent\r\nround to all the cities and made proclamation granting a free pardon to\r\nthe thief, and also promising a great reward if he would come into his\r\npresence. The thief accordingly trusting to the proclamation came to\r\nthe king, and Rhampsinitos greatly marvelled at him, and gave him this\r\ndaughter of his to wife, counting him to be the most knowing of all men;\r\nfor as the Egyptians were distinguished from all other men, so was he\r\nfrom the other Egyptians.\r\n\r\n122. After these things they said this king went down alive to that\r\nplace which by the Hellenes is called Hades, and there played at dice\r\nwith Demeter, and in some throws he overcame her and in others he was\r\novercome by her; and he came back again having as a gift from her a\r\nhandkerchief of gold: and they told me that because of the going down of\r\nRhampsinitos the Egyptians after he came back celebrated a feast, which\r\nI know of my own knowledge also that they still observe even to my time;\r\nbut whether it is for this cause that they keep the feast or for\r\nsome other, I am not able to say. However, the priests weave a robe\r\ncompletely on the very day of the feast, and forthwith they bind up the\r\neyes of one of them with a fillet, and having led him with the robe to\r\nthe way by which one goes to the temple of Demeter, they depart back\r\nagain themselves. This priest, they say, with his eyes bound up is led\r\nby two wolves to the temple of Demeter, which is distant from the city\r\ntwenty furlongs, and then afterwards the wolves lead him back again from\r\nthe temple to the same spot.\r\n\r\n123. Now as to the tales told by the Egyptians, any man may accept them\r\nto whom such things appear credible; as for me, it is to be understood\r\nthroughout the whole of the history 103 that I write by hearsay that\r\nwhich is reported by the people in each place. The Egyptians say that\r\nDemeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below; and the Egyptians\r\nare also the first who reported the doctrine that the soul of man is\r\nimmortal, and that when the body dies, the soul enters into another\r\ncreature which chances then to be coming to the birth, and when it has\r\ngone the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of the air, it\r\nenters again into a human body as it comes to the birth; and that it\r\nmakes this round in a period of three thousand years. This doctrine\r\ncertain Hellenes adopted, some earlier and some later, as if it were\r\nof their own invention, and of these men I know the names but I abstain\r\nfrom recording them.\r\n\r\n124. Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there\r\nwas in Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt prospered greatly; but\r\nafter him Cheops became king over them and brought them 104 to every\r\nkind of evil: for he shut up all the temples, and having first kept them\r\nfrom sacrificing there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for him.\r\nSo some were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the\r\nArabian mountains to the Nile, and others he ordered to receive the\r\nstones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw\r\nthem to those which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by\r\na hundred thousand men at a time, for each three months continually. Of\r\nthis oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by\r\nwhich they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work\r\nnot much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length\r\nof it is five furlongs 105 and the breadth ten fathoms and the height,\r\nwhere it is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed\r\nand with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, the ten years\r\nwere spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the\r\npyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for\r\nhimself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.\r\nFor the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty\r\nyears; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred\r\nfeet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed\r\nand fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones\r\nbeing less than thirty feet in length.\r\n\r\n125. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call\r\n\"rows\" 106 and others \"bases\": 107 and when they had first made it thus,\r\nthey raised the remaining stones with machines made of short pieces of\r\ntimber, raising them first from the ground to the first stage of the\r\nsteps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another\r\nmachine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to\r\nthe second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the\r\nsteps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred\r\none and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage\r\nsuccessively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be\r\ntold in both ways, according as it is reported. However that may be, the\r\nhighest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded\r\nto finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the\r\nparts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is\r\ndeclared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions\r\nand leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which the\r\ninterpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum of one\r\nthousand six hundred talents of silver was spent; and if this is so, how\r\nmuch besides is likely to have been expended upon the iron with which\r\nthey worked, and upon bread and clothing for the workmen, seeing that\r\nthey were building the works for the time which has been mentioned and\r\nwere occupied for no small time besides, as I suppose, in the cutting\r\nand bringing of the stones and in working at the excavation under the\r\nground?\r\n\r\n126. Cheops moreover came, they said, to such a pitch of wickedness,\r\nthat being in want of money he caused his own daughter to sit in the\r\nstews, and ordered her to obtain from those who came a certain amount of\r\nmoney (how much it was they did not tell me); but she not only obtained\r\nthe sum appointed by her father, but also she formed a design for\r\nherself privately to leave behind her a memorial, and she requested each\r\nman who came in to her to give her one stone upon her building: and of\r\nthese stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front\r\nof the great pyramid in the middle of the three, 108 each side being one\r\nhundred and fifty feet in length.\r\n\r\n127. This Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after\r\nhe was dead his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom. This king\r\nfollowed the same manner as the other, both in all the rest and also in\r\nthat he made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements of that\r\nwhich was built by the former (this I know, having myself also measured\r\nit), and moreover 109 there are no underground chambers beneath nor does\r\na channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other, in\r\nwhich the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round an\r\nisland within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a\r\nbasement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours;\r\nand this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards\r\nsize, 110 building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon\r\nthe same hill, which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they\r\nsaid reigned fifty and six years.\r\n\r\n128. Here then they reckon one hundred and six years, during which they\r\nsay that there was nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples\r\nwere kept closed and not opened during all that time. These kings the\r\nEgyptians by reason of their hatred of them are not very willing to\r\nname; nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of Philitis 111\r\nthe shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those regions.\r\n\r\n129. After him, they said, Mykerinos became king over Egypt, who was the\r\nson of Cheops; and to him his father's deeds were displeasing, and he\r\nboth opened the temples and gave liberty to the people, who were ground\r\ndown to the last extremity of evil, to return to their own business and\r\nto their sacrifices;: also he gave decisions of their causes juster\r\nthan those of all the other kings besides. In regard to this then they\r\ncommend this king more than all the other kings who had arisen in Egypt\r\nbefore him; for he not only gave good decisions, but also when a man\r\ncomplained of the decision, he gave him recompense from his own goods\r\nand thus satisfied his desire. But while Mykerinos was acting mercifully\r\nto his subjects and practising this conduct which has been said,\r\ncalamities befell him, of which the first was this, namely that his\r\ndaughter died, the only child whom he had in his house: and being above\r\nmeasure grieved by that which had befallen him, and desiring to bury his\r\ndaughter in a manner more remarkable than others, he made a cow of\r\nwood, which he covered over with gold, and then within it he buried this\r\ndaughter who, as I said, had died.\r\n\r\n130. This cow was not covered up in the ground, but it might be seen\r\neven down to my own time in the city of Saïs, placed within the royal\r\npalace in a chamber which was greatly adorned; and they offer incense of\r\nall kinds before it every day, and each night a lamp burns beside it all\r\nthrough the night. Near this cow in another chamber stand images of the\r\nconcubines of Mykerinos, as the priests at Saïs told me; for there are\r\nin fact colossal wooden statues, in number about twenty, made with naked\r\nbodies; but who they are I am not able to say, except only that which is\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n131. Some however tell about this cow and the colossal statues the\r\nfollowing tale, namely that Mykerinos was enamoured of his own daughter\r\nand afterwards ravished her; and upon this they say that the girl\r\nstrangled herself for grief, and he buried her in this cow; and her\r\nmother cut off the hands of the maids who had betrayed the daughter to\r\nher father; wherefore now the images of them have suffered that which\r\nthe maids suffered in their life. In thus saying they speak idly, as it\r\nseems to me, especially in what they say about the hands of the statues;\r\nfor as to this, even we ourselves saw that their hands had dropped off\r\nfrom lapse of time, and they were to be seen still lying at their feet\r\neven down to my time.\r\n\r\n132. The cow is covered up with a crimson robe, except only the head and\r\nthe neck, which are seen, overlaid with gold very thickly; and between\r\nthe horns there is the disc of the sun figured in gold. The cow is not\r\nstanding up but kneeling, and in size it is equal to a large living cow.\r\nEvery year it is carried forth from the chamber, at those times, I say,\r\nthe Egyptians beat themselves for that god whom I will not name upon\r\noccasion of such a matter; at these times, I say, they also carry forth\r\nthe cow to the light of day, for they say that she asked of her father\r\nMykerinos, when she was dying, that she might look upon the sun once in\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n133. After the misfortune of his daughter it happened, they said,\r\nsecondly to this king as follows:—An oracle came to him from the city\r\nof Buto, saying that he was destined to live but six years more, in the\r\nseventh year to end his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the\r\nOracle a reproach against the god, 112 making complaint in reply that\r\nwhereas his father and uncle, who had shut up the temples and had not\r\nonly not remembered the gods, but also had been destroyers of men, had\r\nlived for a long time, he himself, who practised piety, was destined to\r\nend his life so soon: and from the Oracle there came a second message,\r\nwhich said that it was for this very cause that he was bringing his life\r\nto a swift close; 113 for he had not done that which it was appointed\r\nfor him to do, since it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils for\r\na hundred and fifty years, and the two kings who had risen before him\r\nhad perceived this, but he had not. Mykerinos having heard this, and\r\nconsidering that this sentence had been passed upon him beyond recall,\r\nprocured many lamps, and whenever night came on he lighted these and\r\nbegan to drink and take his pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor\r\nby night; and he went about to the fen-country and to the woods and\r\nwherever he heard there were the most suitable places for enjoyment.\r\nThis he devised (having a mind to prove that the Oracle spoke falsely)\r\nin order that he might have twelve years of life instead of six, the\r\nnights being turned into days.\r\n\r\n134. This king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller than that of\r\nhis father, of a square shape and measuring on each side three hundred\r\nfeet lacking twenty, built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the\r\nheight. This pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan\r\nRhodopis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is evident\r\nto me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was,\r\nfor otherwise they would not have attributed to her the building of a\r\npyramid like this, on which have been spent (so to speak) innumerable\r\nthousands of talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flourished\r\nin the reign of Amasis, and not in this king's reign; for Rhodopis lived\r\nvery many years later than the kings who left behind the pyramids. By\r\ndescent she was of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon the son of\r\nHephaistopolis a Samian, and a fellow-slave of Esop the maker of fables;\r\nfor he too was once the slave of Iadmon, as was proved especially\r\nin this fact, namely that when the people of Delphi repeatedly made\r\nproclamation in accordance with an oracle, to find some one who would\r\ntake up 114 the blood-money for the death of Esop, no one else appeared,\r\nbut at length the grandson of Iadmon, called Iadmon also, took it up;\r\nand thus it is shown that Esop too was the slave of Iadmon.\r\n\r\n135. As for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian,\r\nand having come thither to exercise her calling she was redeemed\r\nfrom slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of\r\nScamandronymos and brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis\r\nset free, and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so much liking\r\nthat she made great gain of money for one like Rhodopis, 115 though not\r\nenough to suffice for the cost of such a pyramid as this. In truth there\r\nis no need to ascribe to her very great riches, considering that the\r\ntithe of her wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one\r\nwho desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a memorial of\r\nherself in Hellas, namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens\r\nnot to have been thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides, and\r\nto dedicate this at Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with\r\nthe tithe of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size\r\nlarge enough to pierce a whole ox, and many in number, going as far\r\ntherein as her tithe allowed her, and she sent them to Delphi: these\r\nare even at the present time lying there, heaped all together behind the\r\naltar which the Chians dedicated, and just opposite to the cell of the\r\ntemple. 116 Now at Naucratis, as it happens, the courtesans are rather\r\napt to win credit; 117 for this woman first, about whom the story to\r\nwhich I refer is told, became so famous that all the Hellenes without\r\nexception come to know the name of Rhodopis, and then after her one\r\nwhose name was Archidiche became a subject of song over all Hellas,\r\nthough she was less talked of than the other. As for Charaxos, when\r\nafter redeeming Rhodopis he returned back to Mytilene, Sappho in an ode\r\nviolently abused him. 118 Of Rhodopis then I shall say no more.\r\n\r\n136. After Mykerinos the priests said Asychis became king of Egypt,\r\nand he made for Hephaistos the temple gateway 119 which is towards the\r\nsunrising, by far the most beautiful and the largest of the gateways;\r\nfor while they all have figures carved upon them and innumerable\r\nornaments of building 120 besides, this has them very much more than\r\nthe rest. In this king's reign they told me that, as the circulation of\r\nmoney was very slow, a law was made for the Egyptians that a man might\r\nhave that money lent to him which he needed, by offering as security\r\nthe dead body of his father; and there was added moreover to this law\r\nanother, namely that he who lent the money should have a claim also to\r\nthe whole sepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it, and that\r\nthe man who offered that security should be subject to this penalty,\r\nif he refused to pay back the debt, namely that neither the man himself\r\nshould be allowed to have burial when he died, either in that family\r\nburial-place or in any other, nor should he be allowed to bury any one\r\nof his kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring to surpass the\r\nkings of Egypt who had arisen before him left as a memorial of himself\r\na pyramid which he made of bricks, and on it there is an inscription\r\ncarved in stone and saying thus: \"Despise not me in comparison with the\r\npyramids of stone, seeing that I excel them as much as Zeus excels the\r\nother gods; for with a pole they struck into the lake, and whatever\r\nof the mud attached itself to the pole, this they gathered up and made\r\nbricks, and in such manner they finished me.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the deeds which this king performed;\r\n\r\n137, and after him reigned a blind man of the city of Anysis, whose\r\nname was Anysis. In his reign the Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the\r\nEthiopians marched upon Egypt with a great host of men; so this blind\r\nman departed, flying to the fen-country, and the Ethiopian was king\r\nover Egypt for fifty years, during which he performed deeds as\r\nfollows:—whenever any man of the Egyptians committed any transgression,\r\nhe would never put him to death, but he gave sentence upon each man\r\naccording to the greatness of the wrong-doing, appointing them work at\r\nthrowing up an embankment before that city from whence each man came of\r\nthose who committed wrong. Thus the cities were made higher still than\r\nbefore; for they were embanked first by those who dug the channels in\r\nthe reign of Sesostris, and then secondly in the reign of the Ethiopian,\r\nand thus they were made very high: and while other cities in Egypt also\r\nstood 121 high, I think in the town at Bubastis especially the earth was\r\npiled up. In this city there is a temple very well worthy of mention,\r\nfor though there are other temples which are larger and built with more\r\ncost, none more than this is a pleasure to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the\r\nHellenic tongue is Artemis,\r\n\r\n138, and her temple is ordered thus:—Except the entrance it is\r\ncompletely surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not\r\njoining one another, but each extending as far as the entrance of the\r\ntemple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other\r\nside, each a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the\r\ngateway has a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with figures six\r\ncubits high, very noteworthy. This temple is in the middle of the city\r\nand is looked down upon from all sides as one goes round, for since the\r\ncity has been banked up to a height, while the temple has not been moved\r\nfrom the place where it was at the first built, it is possible to look\r\ndown into it: and round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon\r\nit, while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round\r\na large temple-house, within which is the image of the goddess: and the\r\nbreadth and length of the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the\r\nentrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs,\r\nwhich leads through the market-place towards the East, with a breadth\r\nof about four hundred feet; and on this side and on that grow trees of\r\nheight reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes.\r\nThis temple then is thus ordered.\r\n\r\n139. The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said)\r\nas follows:—he fled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision, in\r\nwhich it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled\r\nhim to gather together all the priests of Egypt and cut them asunder in\r\nthe midst. Having seen this dream, he said that it seemed to him that\r\nthe gods were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him,\r\n122 in order that he might do an impious deed with respect to religion,\r\nand so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would not\r\nhowever do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during\r\nwhich it had been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before\r\nhe departed thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the\r\nEthiopians consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt\r\nfifty years: since then this time was now expiring, and the vision of\r\nthe dream also disturbed him, Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own\r\nfree will.\r\n\r\n140. Then when the Ethiopian had gone away out of Egypt, the blind man\r\ncame back from the fen-country and began to rule again, having lived\r\nthere during fifty years upon an island which he had made by heaping up\r\nashes and earth: for whenever any of the Egyptians visited him bringing\r\nfood, according as it had been appointed to them severally to do without\r\nthe knowledge of the Ethiopian, he bade them bring also some ashes for\r\ntheir gift. 123 This island none was able to find before Amyrtaios; that\r\nis, for more than seven hundred years 124 the kings who arose before\r\nAmyrtaios were not able to find it. Now the name of this island is Elbo,\r\nand its size is ten furlongs each way.\r\n\r\n141. After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose\r\nname was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard\r\nthe warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no\r\nneed of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also\r\ntook from them the yokes of corn-land 125 which had been given to them\r\nas a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes\r\nto each man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the\r\nAssyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the\r\nEgyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven\r\ninto a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple 126 and bewailed\r\nto the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as\r\nhe was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his\r\nvision that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying\r\nthat he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of\r\nthe Arabians; for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in\r\nthese things seen in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the\r\nEgyptians who were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for\r\nby this way the invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed\r\nhim, but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after\r\nthey came, there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields,\r\nand ate up their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of\r\ntheir shields, so that on the next day they fled, and being without\r\ndefence of arms great numbers fell. And at the present time this king\r\nstands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a\r\nmouse, and by letters inscribed he says these words: \"Let him who looks\r\nupon me learn to fear the gods.\"\r\n\r\n142. So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who\r\nmade the report, declaring that from the first king down to this\r\npriest of Hephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and\r\nforty-one generations of men, and that in them there had been the same\r\nnumber of chief-priests and of kings: but three hundred generations\r\nof men are equal to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three\r\ngenerations of men; and in the one-and-forty generations which remain,\r\nthose I mean which were added to the three hundred, there are one\r\nthousand three hundred and forty years. Thus in the period of eleven\r\nthousand three hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen\r\nno god in human form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the\r\nremaining kings who arose in Egypt, did they report that anything of\r\nthat kind had come to pass. In this time they said that the sun had\r\nmoved four times from his accustomed place of rising, and where he now\r\nsets he had thence twice had his rising, and in the place from whence he\r\nnow rises he had twice had his setting; 127 and in the meantime nothing\r\nin Egypt had been changed from its usual state, neither that which comes\r\nfrom the earth nor that which comes to them from the river nor that\r\nwhich concerns diseases or deaths.\r\n\r\n143. And formerly when Hecataios the historian was in Thebes, and had\r\ntraced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth\r\ngeneration before, the priests of Zeus did for him much the same as they\r\ndid for me (though I had not traced my descent). They led me into the\r\nsanctuary of the temple, which is of great size, and they counted up the\r\nnumber, showing colossal wooden statues in number the same as they said;\r\nfor each chief-priest there sets up in his lifetime an image of himself:\r\naccordingly the priests, counting and showing me these, declared to me\r\nthat each one of them was a son succeeding his own father, and they went\r\nup through the series of images from the image of the one who had\r\ndied last, until they had declared this of the whole number. And when\r\nHecataios had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in\r\nthe sixteenth generation, they traced a descent in opposition to this,\r\nbesides their numbering, not accepting it from him that a man had been\r\nborn from a god; and they traced their counter-descent thus, saying that\r\neach one of the statues had been piromis son of piromis, until they had\r\ndeclared this of the whole three hundred and forty-five statues, each\r\none being surnamed piromis; and neither with a god nor a hero did\r\nthey connect their descent. Now piromis means in the tongue of Hellas\r\n\"honourable and good man.\"\r\n\r\n144. From their declaration then it followed, that they of whom the\r\nimages were had been of form like this, and far removed from being gods:\r\nbut in the time before these men they said that gods were the rulers in\r\nEgypt, not mingling 128 with men, and that of these always one had power\r\nat a time; and the last of them who was king over Egypt was Oros the son\r\nof Osiris, whom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over Egypt last,\r\nhaving deposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.\r\n\r\n145. Among the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the\r\nlatest-born of the gods; but with the Egyptians Pan is a very ancient\r\ngod, and he is one of those which are called the eight gods, while\r\nHeracles is of the second rank, who are called the twelve gods, and\r\nDionysos is of the third rank, namely of those who were born of the\r\ntwelve gods. Now as to Heracles I have shown already how many years old\r\nhe is according to the Egyptians themselves, reckoning down to the\r\nreign of Amasis, and Pan is said to have existed for yet more years than\r\nthese, and Dionysos for the smallest number of years as compared with\r\nthe others; and even for this last they reckon down to the reign of\r\nAmasis fifteen thousand years. This the Egyptians say that they know for\r\na certainty, since they always kept a reckoning and wrote down the years\r\nas they came. Now the Dionysos who is said to have been born of Semele\r\nthe daughter of Cadmos, was born about sixteen hundred years before my\r\ntime, and Heracles who was the son of Alcmene, about nine hundred years,\r\nand that Pan who was born of Penelope, for of her and of Hermes Pan is\r\nsaid by the Hellenes to have been born, came into being later than the\r\nwars of Troy, about eight hundred years before my time.\r\n\r\n146. Of these two accounts every man may adopt that one which he shall\r\nfind the more credible when he hears it. I however, for my part, have\r\nalready declared my opinion about them. 129 For if these also, like\r\nHeracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared before all men's eyes and\r\nhad lived their lives to old age in Hellas, I mean Dionysos the son of\r\nSemele and Pan the son of Penelope, then one would have said that these\r\nalso 130 had been born mere men, having the names of those gods who had\r\ncome into being long before: but as it is, with regard to Dionysos the\r\nHellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus sewed him up in his thigh\r\nand carried him to Nysa, which is above Egypt in the land of Ethiopia;\r\nand as to Pan, they cannot say whither he went after he was born. Hence\r\nit has become clear to me that the Hellenes learnt the names of these\r\ngods later than those of the other gods, and trace their descent as if\r\ntheir birth occurred at the time when they first learnt their names.\r\n\r\nThus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves;\r\n\r\n147, but I will now recount that which other nations also tell, and the\r\nEgyptians in agreement with the others, of that which happened in this\r\nland: and there will be added to this also something of that which I\r\nhave myself seen.\r\n\r\nBeing set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos, the\r\nEgyptians, since they could not live any time without a king, set up\r\nover them twelve kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve parts.\r\nThese made intermarriages with one another and reigned, making agreement\r\nthat they would not put down one another by force, nor seek to get an\r\nadvantage over one another, but would live in perfect friendship: and\r\nthe reason why they made these agreements, guarding them very strongly\r\nfrom violation, was this, namely that an oracle had been given to them\r\nat first when they began to exercise their rule, that he of them who\r\nshould pour a libation with a bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos,\r\nshould be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble together in all\r\nthe temples).\r\n\r\n148. Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a memorial of\r\nthemselves; and having so resolved they caused to be made a labyrinth,\r\nsituated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly opposite to that\r\nwhich is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw myself, and I found\r\nit greater than words can say. For if one should put together and reckon\r\nup all the buildings and all the great works produced by the Hellenes,\r\nthey would prove to be inferior in labour and expense to this labyrinth,\r\nthough it is true that both the temple at Ephesos and that at Samos are\r\nworks worthy of note. The pyramids also were greater than words can say,\r\nand each one of them is equal to many works of the Hellenes, great\r\nas they may be; but the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids. It has\r\ntwelve courts covered in, with gates facing one another, six upon the\r\nNorth side and six upon the South, joining on one to another, and the\r\nsame wall surrounds them all outside; and there are in it two kinds of\r\nchambers, the one kind below the ground and the other above upon these,\r\nthree thousand in number, of each kind fifteen hundred. The upper set\r\nof chambers we ourselves saw, going through them, and we tell of them\r\nhaving looked upon them with our own eyes; but the chambers under ground\r\nwe heard about only; for the Egyptians who had charge of them were\r\nnot willing on any account to show them, saying that here were the\r\nsepulchres of the kings who had first built this labyrinth and of the\r\nsacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of the chambers below by what we\r\nreceived from hearsay, while those above we saw ourselves and found them\r\nto be works of more than human greatness. For the passages through the\r\nchambers, and the goings this way and that way through the courts, which\r\nwere admirably adorned, afforded endless matter for marvel, as we went\r\nthrough from a court to the chambers beyond it, and from the chambers\r\nto colonnades, and from the colonnades to other rooms, and then from the\r\nchambers again to other courts. Over the whole of these is a roof made\r\nof stone like the walls; and the walls are covered with figures carved\r\nupon them, each court being surrounded with pillars of white stone\r\nfitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the labyrinth, by\r\nthe corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty fathoms, upon which large\r\nfigures are carved, and to this there is a way made under ground.\r\n\r\n149. Such is this labyrinth; but a cause for marvel even greater than\r\nthis is afforded by the lake, which is called the lake of Moiris, along\r\nthe side of which this labyrinth is built. The measure of its circuit is\r\nthree thousand six hundred furlongs 131 (being sixty schoines), and this\r\nis the same number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself along the\r\nsea. The lake lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and in depth\r\nwhere it is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is artificial\r\nand formed by digging is self-evident, for about in the middle of the\r\nlake stand two pyramids, each rising above the water to a height of\r\nfifty fathoms, the part which is built below the water being of just the\r\nsame height; and upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting\r\nupon a chair. Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these\r\nhundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom\r\nbeing measured as six feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms\r\neach, and the cubits six. The water in the lake does not come from the\r\nplace where it is, for the country there is very deficient in water, but\r\nit has been brought thither from the Nile by a canal: and for six months\r\nthe water flows into the lake, and for six months out into the Nile\r\nagain; and whenever it flows out, then for the six months it brings\r\ninto the royal treasury a talent of silver a day from the fish which are\r\ncaught, and twenty pounds 132 when the water comes in.\r\n\r\n150. The natives of the place moreover said that this lake had an\r\noutlet under ground to the Syrtis which is in Libya, turning towards the\r\ninterior of the continent upon the Western side and running along by\r\nthe mountain which is above Memphis. Now since I did not see anywhere\r\nexisting the earth dug out of this excavation (for that was a matter\r\nwhich drew my attention), I asked those who dwelt nearest to the lake\r\nwhere the earth was which had been dug out. These told me to what place\r\nit had been carried away; and I readily believed them, for I knew by\r\nreport that a similar thing had been done at Nineveh, the city of the\r\nAssyrians. There certain thieves formed a design once to carry away the\r\nwealth of Sardanapallos son of Ninos, the king, which wealth was very\r\ngreat and was kept in treasure-houses under the earth. Accordingly they\r\nbegan from their own dwelling, and making estimate of their direction\r\nthey dug under ground towards the king's palace; and the earth which was\r\nbrought out of the excavation they used to carry away, when night came\r\non, to the river Tigris which flows by the city of Nineveh, until at\r\nlast they accomplished that which they desired. Similarly, as I heard,\r\nthe digging of the lake in Egypt was effected, except that it was done\r\nnot by night but during the day; for as they dug the Egyptians carried\r\nto the Nile the earth which was dug out; and the river, when it received\r\nit, would naturally bear it away and disperse it. Thus is this lake said\r\nto have been dug out.\r\n\r\n151. Now the twelve kings continued to rule justly, but in course of\r\ntime it happened thus:—After sacrifice in the temple of Hephaistos\r\nthey were about to make libation on the last day of the feast, and the\r\nchief-priest, in bringing out for them the golden cups with which they\r\nhad been wont to pour libations, missed his reckoning and brought eleven\r\nonly for the twelve kings. Then that one of them who was standing last\r\nin order, namely Psammetichos, since he had no cup took off from his\r\nhead his helmet, which was of bronze, and having held it out to receive\r\nthe wine he proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings\r\nwere wont to wear helmets and they happened to have them then. Now\r\nPsammetichos held out his helmet with no treacherous meaning; but they\r\ntaking note of that which had been done by Psammetichos and of the\r\noracle, namely how it had been declared to them that whosoever of them\r\nshould make libation with a bronze cup should be sole king of Egypt,\r\nrecollecting, I say, the saying of the Oracle, they did not indeed deem\r\nit right to slay Psammetichos, since they found by examination that he\r\nhad not done it with any forethought, but they determined to strip him\r\nof almost all his power and to drive him away into the fen-country, and\r\nthat from the fen-country he should not hold any dealings with the rest\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\n152. This Psammetichos had formerly been a fugitive from the Ethiopian\r\nSabacos who had killed his father Necos, from him, I say, he had\r\nthen been a fugitive in Syria; and when the Ethiopian had departed in\r\nconsequence of the vision of the dream, the Egyptians who were of the\r\ndistrict of Saïs brought him back to his own country. Then afterwards,\r\nwhen he was king, it was his fate to be a fugitive a second time\r\non account of the helmet, being driven by the eleven kings into the\r\nfen-country. So then holding that he had been grievously wronged by\r\nthem, he thought how he might take vengeance on those who had driven\r\nhim out: and when he had sent to the Oracle of Leto in the city of Buto,\r\nwhere the Egyptians have their most truthful Oracle, there was given to\r\nhim the reply that vengeance would come when men of bronze appeared from\r\nthe sea. And he was strongly disposed not to believe that bronze men\r\nwould come to help him; but after no long time had passed, certain\r\nIonians and Carians who had sailed forth for plunder were compelled to\r\ncome to shore in Egypt, and they having landed and being clad in bronze\r\narmour, one of the Egyptians, not having before seen men clad in bronze\r\narmour, came to the fen-land and brought a report to Psammetichos that\r\nbronze men had come from the sea and were plundering the plain. So he,\r\nperceiving that the saying of the Oracle was coming to pass, dealt in a\r\nfriendly manner with the Ionians and Carians, and with large promises he\r\npersuaded them to take his part. Then when he had persuaded them, with\r\nthe help of those Egyptians who favoured his cause and of these foreign\r\nmercenaries he overthrew the kings.\r\n\r\n153. Having thus got power over all Egypt, Psammetichos made for\r\nHephaistos that gateway of the temple at Memphis which is turned towards\r\nthe South Wind; and he built a court for Apis, in which Apis is kept\r\nwhen he appears, opposite to the gateway of the temple, surrounded all\r\nwith pillars and covered with figures; and instead of columns there\r\nstand to support the roof of the court colossal statues twelve cubits\r\nhigh. Now Apis is in the tongue of the Hellenes Epaphos.\r\n\r\n154. To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him Psammetichos\r\ngranted portions of land to dwell in, opposite to one another with\r\nthe river Nile between, and these were called \"Encampments\": 133 these\r\nportions of land he gave them, and he paid them besides all that he had\r\npromised: moreover he placed with them Egyptian boys to have them taught\r\nthe Hellenic tongue; and from these, who learnt the language thoroughly,\r\nare descended the present class of interpreters in Egypt. Now the\r\nIonians and Carians occupied these portions of land for a long time, and\r\nthey are towards the sea a little below the city of Bubastis, on that\r\nwhich is called the Pelusian mouth of the Nile. These men king Amasis\r\nafterwards removed from thence and established them at Memphis, making\r\nthem into a guard for himself against the Egyptians: and they being\r\nsettled in Egypt, we who are Hellenes know by intercourse with them\r\nthe certainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning from king\r\nPsammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first men of foreign\r\ntongue who settled in Egypt: and in the land from which they were\r\nremoved there still remained down to my time the sheds where their ships\r\nwere drawn up and the ruins of their houses.\r\n\r\nThus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt:\r\n\r\n155, and of the Oracle which is in Egypt I have made mention often\r\nbefore this, and now I will give an account of it, seeing that it is\r\nworthy to be described. This Oracle which is in Egypt is sacred to Leto,\r\nand it is established in a great city near that mouth of the Nile which\r\nis called Sebennytic, as one sails up the river from the sea; and the\r\nname of this city where the Oracle is found is Buto, as I have said\r\nbefore in mentioning it. In this Buto there is a temple of Apollo and\r\nArtemis; and the temple-house 134 of Leto, in which the Oracle is, is\r\nboth great in itself and has a gateway of the height of ten fathoms: but\r\nthat which caused me most to marvel of the things to be seen there, I\r\nwill now tell. There is in this sacred enclosure a house of Leto made of\r\none single stone as regards both height and length, and of which all the\r\nwalls are in these two directions equal, each being forty cubits; and\r\nfor the covering in of the roof there lies another stone upon the top,\r\nthe cornice measuring four cubits. 135\r\n\r\n156. This house then of all the things that were to be seen by me in\r\nthat temple is the most marvellous, and among those which come next is\r\nthe island called Chemmis. This is situated in a deep and broad lake\r\nby the side of the temple at Buto, and it is said by the Egyptians\r\nthat this island is a floating island. I myself did not see it either\r\nfloating about or moved from its place, and I feel surprise at hearing\r\nof it, wondering if it be indeed a floating island. In this island of\r\nwhich I speak there is a great temple-house of Apollo, and three several\r\naltars are set up within, and there are planted in the island many\r\npalm-trees and other trees, both bearing fruit and not bearing fruit.\r\nAnd the Egyptians, when they say that it is floating, add this story,\r\nnamely that in this island, which formerly was not floating, Leto, being\r\none of the eight gods who came into existence first, and dwelling in the\r\ncity of Buto where she has this Oracle, received Apollo from Isis as a\r\ncharge and preserved him, concealing him in the island which is said now\r\nto be a floating island, at that time when Typhon came after him seeking\r\neverywhere and desiring to find the son of Osiris. Now they say that\r\nApollo and Artemis are children of Dionysos and of Isis, and that Leto\r\nbecame their nurse and preserver; and in the Egyptian tongue Apollo is\r\nOros, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is Bubastis. From this story and from\r\nno other Æschylus the son of Euphorion took 136 this which I shall say,\r\nwherein he differs from all the preceding poets; he represented namely\r\nthat Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For this reason then, they\r\nsay, it became a floating island.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story which they tell;\r\n\r\n157, but as for Psammetichos, he was king over Egypt for four-and-fifty\r\nyears, of which for thirty years save one he was sitting before Azotos,\r\na great city of Syria, besieging it, until at last he took it: and this\r\nAzotos of all cities about which we have knowledge held out for the\r\nlongest time under a siege.\r\n\r\n158. The son of Psammetichos was Necos, and he became king of Egypt.\r\nThis man was the first who attempted the channel leading to the\r\nErythraian Sea, which Dareios the Persian afterwards completed: the\r\nlength of this is a voyage of four days, and in breadth it was so dug\r\nthat two triremes could go side by side driven by oars; and the water is\r\nbrought into it from the Nile. The channel is conducted a little above\r\nthe city of Bubastis by Patumos the Arabian city, and runs into the\r\nErythraian Sea: and it is dug first along those parts of the plain of\r\nEgypt which lie towards Arabia, just above which run the mountains which\r\nextend opposite Memphis, where are the stone-quarries,—along the base of\r\nthese mountains the channel is conducted from West to East for a great\r\nway; and after that it is directed towards a break in the hills and\r\ntends from these mountains towards the noon-day and the South Wind\r\nto the Arabian gulf. Now in the place where the journey is least and\r\nshortest from the Northern to the Southern Sea (which is also called\r\nErythraian), that is from Mount Casion, which is the boundary between\r\nEgypt and Syria, the distance is exactly 137 a thousand furlongs to the\r\nArabian gulf; but the channel is much longer, since it is more winding;\r\nand in the reign of Necos there perished while digging it twelve myriads\r\n13701 of the Egyptians. Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging,\r\nbecause the utterance of an Oracle impeded him, which was to the effect\r\nthat he was working for the Barbarian: and the Egyptians call all men\r\nBarbarians who do not agree with them in speech.\r\n\r\n159. Thus having ceased from the work of the channel, Necos betook\r\nhimself to waging wars, and triremes were built by him, some for the\r\nNorthern Sea and others in the Arabian gulf for the Erythraian Sea; and\r\nof these the sheds are still to be seen. These ships he used when he\r\nneeded them; and also on land Necos engaged battle at Magdolos with the\r\nSyrians, and conquered them; and after this he took Cadytis, which is\r\na great city of Syria: and the dress which he wore when he made these\r\nconquests he dedicated to Apollo, sending it to Branchidai of the\r\nMilesians. After this, having reigned in all sixteen years, he brought\r\nhis life to an end, and handed on the kingdom to Psammis his son.\r\n\r\n160. While this Psammis was king of Egypt, there came to him men sent by\r\nthe Eleians, who boasted that they ordered the contest at Olympia in the\r\nmost just and honourable manner possible and thought that not even the\r\nEgyptians, the wisest of men, could find out anything besides, to be\r\nadded to their rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that\r\nfor which they had come, then this king called together those of the\r\nEgyptians who were reputed the wisest, and when the Egyptians had come\r\ntogether they heard the Eleians tell of all that which it was their part\r\nto do in regard to the contest; and when they had related everything,\r\nthey said that they had come to learn in addition anything which the\r\nEgyptians might be able to find out besides, which was juster than this.\r\nThey then having consulted together asked the Eleians whether their own\r\ncitizens took part in the contest; and they said that it was permitted\r\nto any one who desired it, both of their own people and of the other\r\nHellenes equally, to take part in the contest: upon which the Egyptians\r\nsaid that in so ordering the games they had wholly missed the mark of\r\njustice; for it could not be but that they would take part with the man\r\nof their own State, if he was contending, and so act unfairly to the\r\nstranger: but if they really desired, as they said, to order the games\r\njustly, and if this was the cause for which they had come to Egypt, they\r\nadvised them to order the contest so as to be for strangers alone to\r\ncontend in, and that no Eleian should be permitted to contend. Such was\r\nthe suggestion made by the Egyptians to the Eleians.\r\n\r\n161. When Psammis had been king of Egypt for only six years and had made\r\nan expedition to Ethiopia and immediately afterwards had ended his life,\r\nApries the son of Psammis received the kingdom in succession. This man\r\ncame to be the most prosperous of all the kings up to that time except\r\nonly his forefather Psammetichos; and he reigned five-and-twenty years,\r\nduring which he led an army against Sidon and fought a sea-fight with\r\nthe king of Tyre. Since however it was fated that evil should come upon\r\nhim, it came by occasion of a matter which I shall relate at greater\r\nlength in the Libyan history, 138 and at present but shortly. Apries\r\nhaving sent a great expedition against the Kyrenians, met with\r\ncorrespondingly great disaster; and the Egyptians considering him\r\nto blame for this revolted from him, supposing that Apries had with\r\nforethought sent them out to evident calamity, in order (as they said)\r\nthat there might be a slaughter of them, and he might the more securely\r\nrule over the other Egyptians. Being indignant at this, both these men\r\nwho had returned from the expedition and also the friends of those who\r\nhad perished made revolt openly.\r\n\r\n162. Hearing this Apries sent to them Amasis, to cause them to cease\r\nby persuasion; and when he had come and was seeking to restrain the\r\nEgyptians, as he was speaking and telling them not to do so, one of the\r\nEgyptians stood up behind him and put a helmet 139 upon his head, saying\r\nas he did so that he put it on to crown him king. And to him this\r\nthat was done was in some degree not unwelcome, as he proved by his\r\nbehaviour; for as soon as the revolted Egyptians had set him up as king,\r\nhe prepared to march against Apries: and Apries hearing this sent to\r\nAmasis one of the Egyptians who were about his own person, a man of\r\nreputation, whose name was Patarbemis, enjoining him to bring Amasis\r\nalive into his presence. When this Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis,\r\nthe latter, who happened to be sitting on horseback, lifted up his leg\r\nand behaved in an unseemly manner, 140 bidding him take that back to\r\nApries. Nevertheless, they say, Patarbemis made demand of him that he\r\nshould go to the king, seeing that the king had sent to summon him; and\r\nhe answered him that he had for some time past been preparing to do\r\nso, and that Apries would have no occasion to find fault with him. Then\r\nPatarbemis both perceiving his intention from that which he said, and\r\nalso seeing his preparations, departed in haste, desiring to make known\r\nas quickly as possible to the king the things which were being done:\r\nand when he came back to Apries not bringing Amasis, the king paying\r\nno regard to that which he said, 141 but being moved by violent anger,\r\nordered his ears and his nose to be cut off. And the rest of the\r\nEgyptians who still remained on his side, when they saw the man of most\r\nrepute among them thus suffering shameful outrage, waited no longer but\r\njoined the others in revolt, and delivered themselves over to Amasis.\r\n\r\n163. Then Apries having heard this also, armed his foreign mercenaries\r\nand marched against the Egyptians: now he had about him Carian and\r\nIonian mercenaries to the number of thirty thousand; and his royal\r\npalace was in the city of Saïs, of great size and worthy to be seen.\r\nSo Apries and his army were going against the Egyptians, and Amasis and\r\nthose with him were going against the mercenaries; and both sides came\r\nto the city of Momemphis and were about to make trial of one another in\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n164. Now of the Egyptians there are seven classes, and of these one\r\nclass is called that of the priests, and another that of the\r\nwarriors, while the others are the cowherds, swineherds, shopkeepers,\r\ninterpreters, and boatmen. This is the number of the classes of the\r\nEgyptians, and their names are given them from the occupations\r\nwhich they follow. Of them the warriors are called Calasirians and\r\nHermotybians, and they are of the following districts, 142—for all Egypt\r\nis divided into districts.\r\n\r\n165. The districts of the Hermotybians are those of Busiris, Saïs,\r\nChemmis, Papremis, the island called Prosopitis, and the half of\r\nNatho,—of these districts are the Hermotybians, who reached when most\r\nnumerous the number of sixteen myriads. 14201 Of these not one has\r\nlearnt anything of handicraft, but they are given up to war entirely.\r\n\r\n166. Again the districts of the Calasirians are those of Thebes,\r\nBubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennytos, Athribis, Pharbaithos,\r\nThmuïs Onuphis, Anytis, Myecphoris,—this last is on an island opposite\r\nto the city of Bubastis. These are the districts of the Calasirians;\r\nand they reached, when most numerous, to the number of five-and-twenty\r\nmyriads 14202 of men; nor is it lawful for these, any more than for the\r\nothers, to practise any craft; but they practise that which has to do\r\nwith war only, handing down the tradition from father to son.\r\n\r\n167. Now whether the Hellenes have learnt this also from the Egyptians,\r\nI am not able to say for certain, since I see that the Thracians also\r\nand Scythians and Persians and Lydians and almost all the Barbarians\r\nesteem those of their citizens who learn the arts, and the descendants\r\nof them, as less honourable than the rest; while those who have got free\r\nfrom all practice of manual arts are accounted noble, and especially\r\nthose who are devoted to war: however that may be, the Hellenes have all\r\nlearnt this, and especially the Lacedemonians; but the Corinthians least\r\nof all cast slight upon those who practise handicrafts.\r\n\r\n168. The following privilege was specially granted to this class and to\r\nnone others of the Egyptians except the priests, that is to say, each\r\nman had twelve yokes 143 of land specially granted to him free from\r\nimposts: now the yoke of land measures a hundred Egyptian cubits every\r\nway, and the Egyptian cubit is, as it happens, equal to that of Samos.\r\nThis, I say, was a special privilege granted to all, and they also had\r\ncertain advantages in turn and not the same men twice; that is to say, a\r\nthousand of the Calasirians and a thousand of the Hermotybians acted as\r\nbody-guard to the king during each year; 144 and these had besides their\r\nyokes of land an allowance given them for each day of five pounds weight\r\n14401 of bread to each man, and two pounds of beef, and four half-pints\r\n145 of wine. This was the allowance given to those who were serving as\r\nthe king's bodyguard for the time being.\r\n\r\n169. So when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries, and Amasis at\r\nthe head of the whole body of the Egyptians, in their approach to one\r\nanother had come to the city of Momemphis, they engaged battle: and\r\nalthough the foreign troops fought well, yet being much inferior in\r\nnumber they were worsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have\r\nsupposed that not even a god would be able to cause him to cease from\r\nhis rule, so firmly did he think that it was established. In that battle\r\nthen, I say, he was worsted, and being taken alive was brought away to\r\nthe city of Saïs, to that which had formerly been his own dwelling but\r\nfrom thenceforth was the palace of Amasis. There for some time he was\r\nkept in the palace, and Amasis dealt well with him; but at last, since\r\nthe Egyptians blamed him, saying that he acted not rightly in keeping\r\nalive him who was the greatest foe both to themselves and to him,\r\ntherefore he delivered Apries over to the Egyptians; and they strangled\r\nhim, and after that buried him in the burial-place of his fathers: this\r\nis in the temple of Athene, close to the sanctuary, on the left hand as\r\nyou enter. Now the men of Saïs buried all those of this district who had\r\nbeen kings, within the temple; for the tomb of Amasis also, though it is\r\nfurther from the sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers,\r\nyet this too is within the court of the temple, and it consists of\r\na colonnade of stone of great size, with pillars carved to imitate\r\ndate-palms, and otherwise sumptuously adorned; and within the colonnade\r\nare double-doors, and inside the doors a sepulchral chamber.\r\n\r\n170. Also at Saïs there is the burial-place of him whom I account it not\r\npious to name in connexion with such a matter, which is in the temple of\r\nAthene behind the house of the goddess, 146 stretching along the whole\r\nwall of it; and in the sacred enclosure stand great obelisks of stone,\r\nand near them is a lake adorned with an edging of stone and fairly made\r\nin a circle, being in size, as it seemed to me, equal to that which is\r\ncalled the \"Round Pool\" 147 in Delos.\r\n\r\n171. On this lake they perform by night the show of his sufferings, and\r\nthis the Egyptians call Mysteries. Of these things I know more fully in\r\ndetail how they take place, but I shall leave this unspoken; and of the\r\nmystic rites of Demeter, which the Hellenes call thesmophoria, of these\r\nalso, although I know, I shall leave unspoken all except so much as\r\npiety permits me to tell. The daughters of Danaos were they who brought\r\nthis rite out of Egypt and taught it to the women of the Pelasgians;\r\nthen afterwards when all the inhabitants of Peloponnese were driven out\r\nby the Dorians, the rite was lost, and only those who were left behind\r\nof the Peloponnesians and not driven out, that is to say the Arcadians,\r\npreserved it.\r\n\r\n172. Apries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became king, being of\r\nthe district of Saïs, and the name of the city whence he was is Siuph.\r\nNow at the first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no\r\ngreat regard, because he had been a man of the people and was of no\r\ndistinguished family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by\r\nwisdom and not wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which\r\nhe had, there was a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and\r\nall his guests were wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up,\r\nand of it he caused to be made the image of a god, and set it up in the\r\ncity, where it was most convenient; and the Egyptians went continually\r\nto visit the image and did great reverence to it. Then Amasis, having\r\nlearnt that which was done by the men of the city, called together the\r\nEgyptians and made known to them the matter, saying that the image had\r\nbeen produced from the foot-basin, into which formerly the Egyptians\r\nused to vomit and make water, and in which they washed their feet,\r\nwhereas now they did to it great reverence; and just so, he continued,\r\nhad he himself now fared, as the foot-basin; for though formerly he\r\nwas a man of the people, yet now he was their king, and he bade them\r\naccordingly honour him and have regard for him.\r\n\r\n173. In such manner he won the Egyptians to himself, so that they\r\nconsented to be his subjects; and his ordering of affairs was thus:—In\r\nthe early morning, and until the time of the filling of the market he\r\ndid with a good will the business which was brought before him;\r\nbut after this he passed the time in drinking and in jesting at his\r\nboon-companions, and was frivolous and playful. And his friends being\r\ntroubled at it admonished him in some such words as these: \"O king,\r\nthou dost not rightly govern thyself in thus letting thyself descend\r\nto behaviour so trifling; for thou oughtest rather to have been sitting\r\nthroughout the day stately upon a stately throne and administering thy\r\nbusiness; and so the Egyptians would have been assured that they were\r\nruled by a great man, and thou wouldest have had a better report: but as\r\nit is, thou art acting by no means in a kingly fashion.\" And he answered\r\nthem thus: \"They who have bows stretch them at such time as they wish to\r\nuse them, and when they have finished using them they loose them again;\r\n148 for if they were stretched tight always they would break, so that\r\nthe men would not be able to use them when they needed them. So also\r\nis the state of man: if he should always be in earnest and not relax\r\nhimself for sport at the due time, he would either go mad or be struck\r\nwith stupor before he was aware; and knowing this well, I distribute a\r\nportion of the time to each of the two ways of living.\" Thus he replied\r\nto his friends.\r\n\r\n174. It is said however that Amasis, even when he was in a private\r\nstation, was a lover of drinking and of jesting, and not at all\r\nseriously disposed; and whenever his means of livelihood failed him\r\nthrough his drinking and luxurious living, he would go about and steal;\r\nand they from whom he stole would charge him with having their property,\r\nand when he denied it would bring him before the judgment of an Oracle,\r\nwhenever there was one in their place; and many times he was convicted\r\nby the Oracles and many times he was absolved: and then when finally he\r\nbecame king he did as follows:—as many of the gods as had absolved\r\nhim and pronounced him not to be a thief, to their temples he paid no\r\nregard, nor gave anything for the further adornment of them, nor even\r\nvisited them to offer sacrifice, considering them to be worth nothing\r\nand to possess lying Oracles; but as many as had convicted him of being\r\na thief, to these he paid very great regard, considering them to be\r\ntruly gods, and to present Oracles which did not lie.\r\n\r\n175. First in Saïs he built and completed for Athene a temple-gateway\r\nwhich is a great marvel, and he far surpassed herein all who had done\r\nthe like before, both in regard to height and greatness, so large\r\nare the stones and of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated great\r\ncolossal statues and man-headed sphinxes very large, and for restoration\r\nhe brought other stones of monstrous size. Some of these he caused to\r\nbe brought from the stone-quarries which are opposite Memphis, others\r\nof very great size from the city of Elephantine, distant a voyage of not\r\nless than twenty days from Saïs: and of them all I marvel most at this,\r\nnamely a monolith chamber which he brought from the city of Elephantine;\r\nand they were three years engaged in bringing this, and two thousand men\r\nwere appointed to convey it, who all were of the class of boatmen. Of\r\nthis house the length outside is one-and-twenty cubits, the breadth is\r\nfourteen cubits, and the height eight. These are the measures of the\r\nmonolith house outside; but the length inside is eighteen cubits and\r\nfive-sixths of a cubit, 149 the breadth twelve cubits, and the height\r\nfive cubits. This lies by the side of the entrance to the temple; for\r\nwithin the temple they did not draw it, because, as it said, while the\r\nhouse was being drawn along, the chief artificer of it groaned aloud,\r\nseeing that much time had been spent and he was wearied by the work; and\r\nAmasis took it to heart as a warning and did not allow them to draw it\r\nfurther onwards. Some say on the other hand that a man was killed by it,\r\nof those who were heaving it with levers, and that it was not drawn in\r\nfor that reason.\r\n\r\n176. Amasis also dedicated in all the other temples which were of\r\nrepute, works which are worth seeing for their size, and among them also\r\nat Memphis the colossal statue which lies on its back in front of the\r\ntemple of Hephaistos, whose length is five-and-seventy feet; and on the\r\nsame base made of the same stone 150 are set two colossal statues, each\r\nof twenty feet in length, one on this side and the other on that side of\r\nthe large statue. 151 There is also another of stone of the same size in\r\nSaïs, lying in the same manner as that at Memphis. Moreover Amasis was\r\nhe who built and finished for Isis her temple at Memphis, which is of\r\ngreat size and very worthy to be seen.\r\n\r\n177. In the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more prosperous\r\nthan at any other time before, both in regard to that which comes to the\r\nland from the river and in regard to that which comes from the land\r\nto its inhabitants, and that at this time the inhabited towns in it\r\nnumbered in all twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the\r\nlaw that every year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the\r\nruler of his district, from what source he got his livelihood, and if\r\nany man did not do this or did not make declaration of an honest way\r\nof living, he should be punished with death. Now Solon the Athenian\r\nreceived from Egypt this law and had it enacted for the Athenians, and\r\nthey have continued to observe it, since it is a law with which none can\r\nfind fault.\r\n\r\n178. Moreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and besides other\r\nproofs of friendship which he gave to several among them, he also\r\ngranted the city of Naucratis for those of them who came to Egypt to\r\ndwell in; and to those who did not desire to stay, but who made voyages\r\nthither, he granted portions of land to set up altars and make sacred\r\nenclosures for their gods. Their greatest enclosure and that one which\r\nhas most name and is most frequented is called the Hellenion, and this\r\nwas established by the following cities in common:—of the Ionians Chios,\r\nTeos, Phocaia, Clazomenai, of the Dorians Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos,\r\nPhaselis, and of the Aiolians Mytilene alone. To these belongs this\r\nenclosure and these are the cities which appoint superintendents of the\r\nport; and all other cities which claim a share in it, are making a claim\r\nwithout any right. 152 Besides this the Eginetans established on their\r\nown account a sacred enclosure dedicated to Zeus, the Samians one to\r\nHera, and the Milesians one to Apollo.\r\n\r\n179. Now in old times Naucratis alone was an open trading-place, and\r\nno other place in Egypt: and if any one came to any other of the Nile\r\nmouths, he was compelled to swear that he came not thither of his own\r\nwill, and when he had thus sworn his innocence he had to sail with his\r\nship to the Canobic mouth, or if it were not possible to sail by reason\r\nof contrary winds, then he had to carry his cargo round the head of the\r\nDelta in boats to Naucratis: thus highly was Naucratis privileged.\r\n\r\n180. Moreover when the Amphictyons had let out the contract for building\r\nthe temple which now exists at Delphi, agreeing to pay a sum of three\r\nhundred talents, (for the temple which formerly stood there had been\r\nburnt down of itself), it fell to the share of the people of Delphi to\r\nprovide the fourth part of the payment; and accordingly the Delphians\r\nwent about to various cities and collected contributions. And when they\r\ndid this they got from Egypt as much as from any place, for Amasis gave\r\nthem a thousand talents' weight of alum, while the Hellenes who dwelt in\r\nEgypt gave them twenty pounds of silver. 153\r\n\r\n181. Also with the people of Kyrene Amasis made an agreement for\r\nfriendship and alliance; and he resolved too to marry a wife from\r\nthence, whether because he desired to have a wife of Hellenic race,\r\nor apart from that, on account of friendship for the people of Kyrene:\r\nhowever that may be, he married, some say the daughter of Battos, others\r\nof Arkesilaos, 154 and others of Critobulos, a man of repute among the\r\ncitizens; and her name was Ladike. Now whenever Amasis lay with her he\r\nfound himself unable to have intercourse, but with his other wives he\r\nassociated as he was wont; and as this happened repeatedly, Amasis said\r\nto his wife, whose name was Ladike: \"Woman, thou hast given me drugs,\r\nand thou shalt surely perish 155 more miserably than any other woman.\"\r\nThen Ladike, when by her denials Amasis was not at all appeased in his\r\nanger against her, made a vow in her soul to Aphrodite, that if Amasis\r\non that night had intercourse with her (seeing that this was the remedy\r\nfor her danger), she would send an image to be dedicated to her at\r\nKyrene; and after the vow immediately Amasis had intercourse, and from\r\nthenceforth whenever Amasis came in to her he had intercourse with her;\r\nand after this he became very greatly attached to her. And Ladike paid\r\nthe vow that she had made to the goddess; for she had an image made\r\nand sent it to Kyrene, and it was still preserved even to my own time,\r\nstanding with its face turned away from the city of the Kyrenians. This\r\nLadike Cambyses, having conquered Egypt and heard from her who she was,\r\nsent back unharmed to Kyrene.\r\n\r\n182. Amasis also dedicated offerings in Hellas, first at Kyrene an image\r\nof Athene covered over with gold and a figure of himself made like by\r\npainting; then in the temple of Athene at Lindson two images of stone\r\nand a corslet of linen worthy to be seen; and also at Samos two wooden\r\nfigures of himself dedicated to Hera, which were standing even to my own\r\ntime in the great temple, behind the doors. Now at Samos he dedicated\r\nofferings because of the guest-friendship between himself and Polycrates\r\nthe son of Aiakes; at Lindos for no guest-friendship but because the\r\ntemple of Athene at Lindos is said to have been founded by the daughters\r\nof Danaos, who had touched land there at the time when they were fleeing\r\nfrom the sons of Aigyptos. These offerings were dedicated by Amasis; and\r\nhe was the first of men who conquered Cyprus and subdued it so that it\r\npaid him tribute.\r\n\r\n—————\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK II\r\n\r\n1 [ Some write \"Psammitichos\" with less authority.]\r\n\r\n2 [ {tou en Memphi}: many Editors read {en Memphi}, \"I heard at Memphis\r\nfrom the priests of Hephaistos,\" but with less authority.]\r\n\r\n3 [ {'Eliou polin} or {'Elioupolin}, cp. {'Elioupolitai} below.]\r\n\r\n4 [ {exo e ta ounamata auton mounon}.

THE THIRD BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED THALEIA\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Against this Amasis then Cambyses the son of Cyrus was making his\r\nmarch, taking with him not only other nations of which he was ruler,\r\nbut also Hellenes, both Ionians and Aiolians: 1 and the cause of the\r\nexpedition was as follows:—Cambyses sent an envoy to Egypt and asked\r\nAmasis to give him his daughter; and he made the request by counsel of\r\nan Egyptian, who brought this upon Amasis 2 having a quarrel with him\r\nfor the following reason:—at the time when Cyrus sent to Amasis and\r\nasked him for a physician of the eyes, whosoever was the best of those\r\nin Egypt, Amasis had selected him from all the physicians in Egypt and\r\nhad torn him away from his wife and children and delivered him up\r\nto Persia. Having, I say, this cause of quarrel, the Egyptian urged\r\nCambyses on by his counsel bidding him ask Amasis for his daughter, in\r\norder that he might either be grieved if he gave her, or if he refused\r\nto give her, might offend Cambyses. So Amasis, who was vexed by the\r\npower of the Persians and afraid of it, knew neither how to give nor how\r\nto refuse: for he was well assured that Cambyses did not intend to have\r\nher as his wife but as a concubine. So making account of the matter\r\nthus, he did as follows:—there was a daughter of Apries the former king,\r\nvery tall and comely of form and the only person left of his house, and\r\nher name was Nitetis. This girl Amasis adorned with raiment and with\r\ngold, and sent her away to Persia as his own daughter: but after a time,\r\nwhen Cambyses saluted her calling her by the name of her father, the\r\ngirl said to him: \"O king, thou dost not perceive how thou hast been\r\ndeceived by Amasis; for he adorned me with ornaments and sent me\r\naway giving me to thee as his own daughter, whereas in truth I am the\r\ndaughter of Apries against whom Amasis rose up with the Egyptians and\r\nmurdered him, who was his lord and master.\" These words uttered and this\r\noccasion having arisen, led Cambyses the son of Cyrus against Egypt,\r\nmoved to very great anger.\r\n\r\n2. Such is the report made by the Persians; but as for the Egyptians\r\nthey claim Cambyses as one of themselves, saying that he was born of\r\nthis very daughter of Apries; for they say that Cyrus was he who sent to\r\nAmasis for his daughter, and not Cambyses. In saying this however they\r\nsay not rightly; nor can they have failed to observe (for the Egyptians\r\nfully as well as any other people are acquainted with the laws and\r\ncustoms of the Persians), first that it is not customary among them for\r\na bastard to become king, when there is a son born of a true marriage,\r\nand secondly that Cambyses was the son of Cassandane the daughter of\r\nPharnaspes, a man of the Achaimenid family, and not the son of the\r\nEgyptian woman: but they pervert the truth of history, claiming to be\r\nkindred with the house of Cyrus. Thus it is with these matters;\r\n\r\n3, and the following story is also told, which for my part I do not\r\nbelieve, namely that one of the Persian women came in to the wives of\r\nCyrus, and when she saw standing by the side of Cassandane children\r\ncomely of form and tall, she was loud in her praises of them, expressing\r\ngreat admiration; and Cassandane, who was the wife of Cyrus, spoke\r\nas follows: \"Nevertheless, though I am the mother of such children of\r\nthese, Cyrus treats me with dishonour and holds in honour her whom he\r\nhas brought in from Egypt.\" Thus she spoke, they say, being vexed by\r\nNitetis, and upon that Cambyses the elder of her sons said: \"For this\r\ncause, mother, when I am grown to be a man, I will make that which is\r\nabove in Egypt to be below, and that which is below above.\" This he is\r\nreported to have said when he was perhaps about ten years old, and the\r\nwomen were astonished by it: and he, they say, kept it ever in mind, and\r\nso at last when he had become a man and had obtained the royal power, he\r\nmade the expedition against Egypt.\r\n\r\n4. Another thing also contributed to this expedition, which was as\r\nfollows:—There was among the foreign mercenaries 3 of Amasis a man who\r\nwas by race of Halicarnassos, and his name was Phanes, one who was both\r\ncapable in judgment and valiant in that which pertained to war. This\r\nPhanes, having (as we may suppose) some quarrel with Amasis, fled away\r\nfrom Egypt in a ship, desiring to come to speech with Cambyses: and as\r\nhe was of no small repute among the mercenaries and was very closely\r\nacquainted with all the affairs of Egypt, Amasis pursued him and\r\nconsidered it a matter of some moment to capture him: and he pursued by\r\nsending after him the most trusted of his eunuchs with a trireme, who\r\ncaptured him in Lykia; but having captured him he did not bring him back\r\nto Egypt, since Phanes got the better of him by cunning; for he made\r\nhis guards drunk and escaped to Persia. So when Cambyses had made his\r\nresolve to march upon Egypt, and was in difficulty about the march, as\r\nto how he should get safely through the waterless region, this man\r\ncame to him and besides informing of the other matters of Amasis, he\r\ninstructed him also as to the march, advising him to send to the king\r\nof the Arabians and ask that he would give him safety of passage through\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\n5. Now by this way only is there a known entrance to Egypt: for from\r\nPhenicia to the borders of the city of Cadytis belongs to the Syrians 4\r\nwho are called of Palestine, and from Cadytis, which is a city I suppose\r\nnot much less than Sardis, from this city the trading stations on the\r\nsea-coast as far as the city of Ienysos belong to the king of Arabia,\r\nand then from Ienysos again the country belongs to the Syrians as far as\r\nthe Serbonian lake, along the side of which Mount Casion extends towards\r\nthe Sea. After that, from the Serbonian lake, in which the story goes\r\nthat Typhon is concealed, from this point onwards the land is Egypt. Now\r\nthe region which lies between the city of Ienysos on the one hand and\r\nMount Casion and the Serbonian lake on the other, which is of no small\r\nextent but as much as a three days' journey, is grievously destitute of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n6. And one thing I shall tell of, which few of those who go in ships to\r\nEgypt have observed, and it is this:—into Egypt from all parts of Hellas\r\nand also from Phenicia are brought twice every year earthenware jars\r\nfull of wine, and yet it may almost be said that you cannot see there\r\none single empty 5 wine-jar.\r\n\r\n7. In what manner, then, it will be asked, are they used up? This also I\r\nwill tell. The head-man 6 of each place must collect all the earthenware\r\njars from his own town and convey them to Memphis, and those at Memphis\r\nmust fill them with water and convey them to these same waterless\r\nregions of Syria: this the jars which come regularly to Egypt and are\r\nemptied 7 there, are carried to Syria to be added to that which has come\r\nbefore. It was the Persians who thus prepared this approach to Egypt,\r\nfurnishing it with water in the manner which has been said, from the\r\ntime when they first took possession of Egypt: but at the time of which\r\nI speak, seeing that water was not yet provided, Cambyses, in accordance\r\nwith what he was told by his Halicarnassian guest, sent envoys to the\r\nArabian king and from him asked and obtained the safe passage, having\r\ngiven him pledges of friendship and received them from him in return.\r\n\r\n8. Now the Arabians have respect for pledges of friendship as much as\r\nthose men in all the world who regard them most; and they give them in\r\nthe following manner:—A man different from those who desire to give the\r\npledges to one another, standing in the midst between the two, cuts\r\nwith a sharp stone the inner parts of the hands, along by the thumbs,\r\nof those who are giving the pledges to one another, and then he takes a\r\nthread from the cloak of each one and smears with the blood seven\r\nstones laid in the midst between them; and as he does this he calls upon\r\nDionysos and Urania. When the man has completed these ceremonies, he who\r\nhas given the pledges commends to the care of his friends the stranger\r\n(or the fellow-tribesman, if he is giving the pledges to one who is\r\na member of his tribe), and the friends think it right that they also\r\nshould have regard for the pledges given. Of gods they believe in\r\nDionysos and Urania alone: moreover they say that the cutting of their\r\nhair is done after the same fashion as that of Dionysos himself; and\r\nthey cut their hair in a circle round, shaving away the hair of the\r\ntemples. Now they call Dionysos Orotalt 8 and Urania they call Alilat.\r\n\r\n9. So then when the Arabian king had given the pledge of friendship to\r\nthe men who had come to him from Cambyses, he contrived as follows:—he\r\ntook skins of camels and filled them with water and loaded them upon the\r\nbacks of all the living camels that he had; and having so done he drove\r\nthem to the waterless region and there awaited the army of Cambyses.\r\nThis which has been related is the more credible of the accounts given,\r\nbut the less credible must also be related, since it is a current\r\naccount. There is a great river in Arabia called Corys, and this runs\r\nout into the Sea which is called Erythraian. From this river then it is\r\nsaid that the king of the Arabians, having got a conduit pipe made by\r\nsewing together raw ox-hides and other skins, of such a length as\r\nto reach to the waterless region, conducted the water through these\r\nforsooth, 9 and had great cisterns dug in the waterless region, that\r\nthey might receive the water and preserve it. Now it is a journey of\r\ntwelve days from the river to this waterless region; and moreover the\r\nstory says that he conducted the water by three 10 conduit-pipes to\r\nthree different parts of it.\r\n\r\n10. Meanwhile Psammenitos the son of Amasis was encamped at the Pelusian\r\nmouth of the Nile waiting for the coming of Cambyses: for Cambyses did\r\nnot find Amasis yet living when he marched upon Egypt, but Amasis had\r\ndied after having reigned forty and four years during which no great\r\nmisfortune had befallen him: and when he had died and had been embalmed\r\nhe was buried in the burial-place in the temple, which he had built for\r\nhimself. 11 Now when Psammenitos son of Amasis was reigning as king,\r\nthere happened to the Egyptians a prodigy, the greatest that had ever\r\nhappened: for rain fell at Thebes in Egypt, where never before had rain\r\nfallen nor afterwards down to my time, as the Thebans themselves say;\r\nfor in the upper parts of Egypt no rain falls at all: but at the time of\r\nwhich I speak rain fell at Thebes in a drizzling shower. 12\r\n\r\n11. Now when the Persians had marched quite through the waterless region\r\nand were encamped near the Egyptians with design to engage battle, then\r\nthe foreign mercenaries of the Egyptian king, who were Hellenes and\r\nCarians, having a quarrel with Phanes because he had brought\r\nagainst Egypt an army of foreign speech, contrived against him as\r\nfollows:—Phanes had children whom he had left behind in Egypt: these\r\nthey brought to their camp and into the sight of their father, and they\r\nset up a mixing-bowl between the two camps, and after that they brought\r\nup the children one by one and cut their throats so that the blood ran\r\ninto the bowl. Then when they had gone through the whole number of the\r\nchildren, they brought and poured into the bowl both wine and water, and\r\nnot until the mercenaries had all drunk of the blood, did they engage\r\nbattle. Then after a battle had been fought with great stubbornness, and\r\nvery many had fallen of both the armies, the Egyptians at length turned\r\nto flight.\r\n\r\n12. I was witness moreover of a great marvel, being informed of it by\r\nthe natives of the place; for of the bones scattered about of those\r\nwho fell in this fight, each side separately, since the bones of the\r\nPersians were lying apart on one side according as they were divided\r\nat first, and those of the Egyptians on the other, the skulls of the\r\nPersians are so weak that if you shall hit them only with a pebble\r\nyou will make a hole in them, while those of the Egyptians are so\r\nexceedingly strong that you would hardly break them if you struck them\r\nwith a large stone. The cause of it, they say, was this, and I for my\r\npart readily believe them, namely that the Egyptians beginning from\r\ntheir early childhood shave their heads, and the bone is thickened by\r\nexposure to the sun: and this is also the cause of their not becoming\r\nbald-headed; for among the Egyptians you see fewer bald-headed men\r\nthan among any other race. This then is the reason why these have their\r\nskulls strong; and the reason why the Persians have theirs weak is that\r\nthey keep them delicately in the shade from the first by wearing tiaras,\r\nthat is felt caps. So far of this: and I saw also a similar thing to\r\nthis at Papremis, in the case of those who were slain together with\r\nAchaimenes the son of Dareios, by Inaros the Libyan.\r\n\r\n13. The Egyptians when they turned to flight from the battle fled in\r\ndisorder: and they being shut up in Memphis, Cambyses sent a ship of\r\nMytilene up the river bearing a Persian herald, to summon the Egyptians\r\nto make terms of surrender; but they, when they saw the ship had\r\nentered into Memphis, pouring forth in a body from the fortress 13 both\r\ndestroyed the ship and also tore the men in it limb from limb, and so\r\nbore them into the fortress. After this the Egyptians being besieged, in\r\ncourse of time surrendered themselves; and the Libyans who dwell on the\r\nborders of Egypt, being struck with terror by that which had happened to\r\nEgypt, delivered themselves up without resistance, and they both laid\r\non themselves a tribute and sent presents: likewise also those of Kyrene\r\nand Barca, being struck with terror equally with 14 the Libyans, acted\r\nin a similar manner: and Cambyses accepted graciously the gifts which\r\ncame from the Libyans, but as for those which came from the men of\r\nKyrene, finding fault with them, as I suppose, because they were too\r\nsmall in amount (for the Kyrenians sent in fact five hundred pounds'\r\nweight 15 of silver), he took the silver by handfuls and scattered it\r\nwith his own hand among his soldiers.\r\n\r\n14. On the tenth day after that on which he received the surrender\r\nof the fortress of Memphis, Cambyses set the king of the Egyptians\r\nPsammenitos, who had been king for six months, to sit in the suburb of\r\nthe city, to do him dishonour,—him I say with other Egyptians he set\r\nthere, and he proceeded to make trial of his spirit as follows:—having\r\narrayed his daughter in the clothing of a slave, he sent her forth with\r\na pitcher to fetch water, and with her he sent also other maidens chosen\r\nfrom the daughters of the chief men, arrayed as was the daughter of the\r\nking: and as the maidens were passing by their fathers with cries and\r\nlamentation, the other men all began to cry out and lament aloud, 16\r\nseeing that their children had been evilly entreated, but Psammenitos\r\nwhen he saw it before his eyes and perceived it bent himself down to the\r\nearth. Then when the water-bearers had passed by, next Cambyses sent his\r\nson with two thousand Egyptians besides who were of the same age, with\r\nropes bound round their necks and bits placed in their mouths; and these\r\nwere being led away to execution to avenge the death of the Mytilenians\r\nwho had been destroyed at Memphis with their ship: for the Royal Judges\r\n17 had decided that for each man ten of the noblest Egyptians should\r\nlose their lives in retaliation. He then, when he saw them passing out\r\nby him and perceived that his son was leading the way 18 to die, did\r\nthe same as he had done with respect to his daughter, while the other\r\nEgyptians who sat round him were lamenting and showing signs of grief.\r\nWhen these also had passed by, it chanced that a man of his table\r\ncompanions, advanced in years, who had been deprived of all his\r\npossessions and had nothing except such things as a beggar possesses,\r\nand was asking alms from the soldiers, passed by Psammenitos the son of\r\nAmasis and the Egyptians who were sitting in the suburb of the city: and\r\nwhen Psammenitos saw him he uttered a great cry of lamentation, and he\r\ncalled his companion by name and beat himself upon the head. Now there\r\nwas, it seems, men set to watch him, who made known to Cambyses all that\r\nhe did on the occasion of each going forth: and Cambyses marvelled\r\nat that which he did, and he sent a messenger and asked him thus:\r\n\"Psammenitos, thy master Cambyses asks thee for what reason, when thou\r\nsawest thy daughter evilly entreated and thy son going to death, thou\r\ndidst not cry aloud nor lament for them, whereas thou didst honour with\r\nthese signs of grief the beggar who, as he hears from others, is not\r\nin any way related to thee?\" Thus he asked, and the other answered\r\nas follows: \"O son of Cyrus, my own troubles were too great for me to\r\nlament them aloud, but the trouble of my companion was such as called\r\nfor tears, seeing that he has been deprived of great wealth, and has\r\ncome to beggary upon the threshold of old age.\" When this saying was\r\nreported by the messenger, it seemed to them 19 that it was well spoken;\r\nand, as is reported by the Egyptians, Croesus shed tears (for he also,\r\nas fortune would have it, had accompanied Cambyses to Egypt) and the\r\nPersians who were present shed tears also; and there entered some pity\r\ninto Cambyses himself, and forthwith he bade them save the life of the\r\nson of Psammenitos from among those who were being put to death, and\r\nalso he bade them raise Psammenitos himself from his place in the suburb\r\nof the city and bring him into his own presence.\r\n\r\n15. As for the son, those who went for him found that he was no longer\r\nalive, but had been cut down first of all, but Psammenitos himself they\r\nraised from his place and brought him into the presence of Cambyses,\r\nwith whom he continued to live for the rest of his time without\r\nsuffering any violence; and if he had known how to keep himself from\r\nmeddling with mischief, he would have received Egypt so as to be ruler\r\nof it, since the Persians are wont to honour the sons of kings, and even\r\nif the kings have revolted from them, they give back the power into the\r\nhands of their sons. Of this, namely that it is their established rule\r\nto act so, one may judge by many instances besides and especially 20\r\nby the case of Thannyras the son of Inaros, who received back the power\r\nwhich his father had, and by that of Pausiris the son of Amyrtaios, for\r\nhe too received back the power of his father: yet it is certain that no\r\nmen ever up to this time did more evil to the Persians than Inaros and\r\nAmyrtaios. As it was, however, Psammenitos devised evil and received the\r\ndue reward: for he was found to be inciting the Egyptians to revolt; and\r\nwhen this became known to Cambyses, Psammenitos drank bull's blood and\r\ndied forthwith. Thus he came to his end.\r\n\r\n16. From Memphis Cambyses came to the city of Saïs with the purpose of\r\ndoing that which in fact he did: for when he had entered into the palace\r\nof Amasis, he forthwith gave command to bring the corpse of Amasis forth\r\nout of his burial-place; and when this had been accomplished, he gave\r\ncommand to scourge it and pluck out the hair and stab it, and to do to\r\nit dishonour in every possible way besides: and when they had done this\r\ntoo until they were wearied out, for the corpse being embalmed held out\r\nagainst the violence and did not fall to pieces in any part, Cambyses\r\ngave command to consume it with fire, enjoining thereby a thing which\r\nwas not permitted by religion: for the Persians hold fire to be a god.\r\nTo consume corpses with fire then is by no means according to the\r\ncustom of either people, of the Persians for the reason which has been\r\nmentioned, since they say that it is not right to give the dead body\r\nof a man to a god; while the Egyptians have the belief established that\r\nfire is a living wild beast, and that it devours everything which it\r\ncatches, and when it is satiated with the food it dies itself together\r\nwith that which it devours: but it is by no means their custom to give\r\nthe corpse of a man to wild beasts, for which reason they embalm it,\r\nthat it may not be eaten by worms as it lies in the tomb. Thus then\r\nCambyses was enjoining them to do that which is not permitted by the\r\ncustoms of either people. However, the Egyptians say that it was not\r\nAmasis who suffered this outrage, but another of the Egyptians who was\r\nof the same stature of body as Amasis; and that to him the Persians did\r\noutrage, thinking that they were doing it to Amasis: for they say that\r\nAmasis learnt from an Oracle that which was about to happen with regard\r\nto himself after his death; and accordingly, to avert the evil which\r\nthreatened to come upon him, he buried the dead body of this man who was\r\nscourged within his own sepulchral chamber near the doors, and enjoined\r\nhis son to lay his own body as much as possible in the inner recess of\r\nthe chamber. These injunctions, said to have been given by Amasis with\r\nregard to his burial and with regard to the man mentioned, were not\r\nin my opinion really given at all, but I think that the Egyptians make\r\npretence of it from pride and with no good ground.\r\n\r\n17. After this Cambyses planned three several expeditions, one against\r\nthe Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, and a third against\r\nthe \"Long-lived\" Ethiopians, who dwell in that part of Libya which is by\r\nthe Southern Sea: and in forming these designs he resolved to send\r\nhis naval force against the Carthaginians, and a body chosen from his\r\nland-army against the Ammonians; and to the Ethiopians to send spies\r\nfirst, both to see whether the table of the Sun existed really, which is\r\nsaid to exist among these Ethiopians, and in addition to this to spy out\r\nall else, but pretending to be bearers of gifts for their king.\r\n\r\n18. Now the table of the Sun is said to be as follows:—there is a meadow\r\nin the suburb of their city full of flesh-meat boiled of all four-footed\r\ncreatures; and in this, it is said, those of the citizens who are in\r\nauthority at the time place the flesh by night, managing the matter\r\ncarefully, and by day any man who wishes comes there and feasts himself;\r\nand the natives (it is reported) say that the earth of herself produces\r\nthese things continually.\r\n\r\n19. Of such nature is the so-called table of the Sun said to be. So when\r\nCambyses had resolved to send the spies, forthwith he sent for those men\r\nof the Ichthyophagoi who understood the Ethiopian tongue, to come from\r\nthe city of Elephantine: and while they were going to fetch these\r\nmen, he gave command to the fleet to sail against Carthage: but the\r\nPhenicians said that they would not do so, for they were bound not to\r\ndo so by solemn vows, and they would not be acting piously if they\r\nmade expedition against their own sons: and as the Phenicians were not\r\nwilling, the rest were rendered unequal to the attempt. Thus then the\r\nCarthaginians escaped being enslaved by the Persians; for Cambyses did\r\nnot think it right to apply force to compel the Phenicians, both because\r\nthey had delivered themselves over to the Persians of their own accord\r\nand because the whole naval force was dependent upon the Phenicians. Now\r\nthe men of Cyprus also had delivered themselves over to the Persians,\r\nand were joining in the expedition against Egypt.\r\n\r\n20. Then as soon as the Ichthyophagoi came to Cambyses from Elephantine,\r\nhe sent them to the Ethiopians, enjoining them what they should say and\r\ngiving them gifts to bear with them, that is to say a purple garment,\r\nand a collar of twisted gold with bracelets, and an alabaster box of\r\nperfumed ointment, and a jar of palm-wine. Now these Ethiopians to whom\r\nCambyses was sending are said to be the tallest and the most beautiful\r\nof all men; and besides other customs which they are reported to have\r\ndifferent from other men, there is especially this, it is said, with\r\nregard to their regal power,—whomsoever of the men of their nation\r\nthey judge to be the tallest and to have strength in proportion to his\r\nstature, this man they appoint to reign over them.\r\n\r\n21. So when the Ichthyophagoi had come to this people they presented\r\ntheir gifts to the king who ruled over them, and at the same time they\r\nsaid as follows: \"The king of the Persians Cambyses, desiring to become\r\na friend and guest to thee, sent us with command to come to speech with\r\nthee, and he gives thee for gifts these things which he himself most\r\ndelights to use.\" The Ethiopian however, perceiving that they had\r\ncome as spies, spoke to them as follows: \"Neither did the king of the\r\nPersians send you bearing gifts because he thought it a matter of great\r\nmoment to become my guest-friend, nor do ye speak true things (for ye\r\nhave come as spies of my kingdom), nor again is he a righteous man; for\r\nif he had been righteous he would not have coveted a land other than his\r\nown, nor would he be leading away into slavery men at whose hands he has\r\nreceived no wrong. Now however give him this bow and speak to him these\r\nwords: The king of the Ethiopians gives this counsel to the king of the\r\nPersians, that when the Persians draw their bows (of equal size to mine)\r\nas easily as I do this, then he should march against the Long-lived\r\nEthiopians, provided that he be superior in numbers; but until that time\r\nhe should feel gratitude to the gods that they do not put it into the\r\nmind of the sons of the Ethiopians to acquire another land in addition\r\nto their own.\"\r\n\r\n22. Having thus said and having unbent the bow, he delivered it to those\r\nwho had come. Then he took the garment of purple and asked what it was\r\nand how it had been made: and when the Ichthyophagoi had told him the\r\ntruth about the purple-fish and the dyeing of the tissue, he said that\r\nthe men were deceitful and deceitful also were their garments. Then\r\nsecondly he asked concerning the twisted gold of the collar and the\r\nbracelets; and when the Ichthyophagoi were setting forth to him the\r\nmanner in which it was fashioned, the king broke into a laugh and said,\r\nsupposing them to be fetters, that they had stronger fetters than those\r\nin their country. Thirdly he asked about the perfumed ointment, and when\r\nthey had told him of the manner of its making and of the anointing with\r\nit, he said the same as he had said before about the garment. Then when\r\nhe came to the wine, and had learned about the manner of its making,\r\nbeing exceedingly delighted with the taste of the drink he asked besides\r\nwhat food the king ate, and what was the longest time that a Persian\r\nman lived. They told him that he ate bread, explaining to him first the\r\nmanner of growing the wheat, and they said that eighty years was the\r\nlongest term of life appointed for a Persian man. In answer to this the\r\nEthiopian said that he did not wonder that they lived but a few years,\r\nwhen they fed upon dung; for indeed they would not be able to live\r\neven so many years as this, if they did not renew their vigour with the\r\ndrink, indicating to the Ichthyophagoi the wine; for in regard to this,\r\nhe said, his people were much behind the Persians.\r\n\r\n23. Then when the Ichthyophagoi asked the king in return about the\r\nlength of days and the manner of life of his people, he answered that\r\nthe greater number of them reached the age of a hundred and twenty\r\nyears, and some surpassed even this; and their food was boiled flesh\r\nand their drink was milk. And when the spies marvelled at the number of\r\nyears, he conducted them to a certain spring, in the water of which they\r\nwashed and became more sleek of skin, as if it were a spring of oil; and\r\nfrom it there came a scent as it were of violets: and the water of this\r\nspring, said the spies, was so exceedingly weak that it was not possible\r\nfor anything to float upon it, either wood or any of those things which\r\nare lighter than wood, but they all went to the bottom. If this water\r\nwhich they have be really such as it is said to be, it would doubtless\r\nbe the cause why the people are long-lived, as making use of it for all\r\nthe purposes of life. Then when they departed from this spring, he led\r\nthem to a prison-house for men, and there all were bound in fetters of\r\ngold. Now among these Ethiopians bronze is the rarest and most precious\r\nof all things. Then when they had seen the prison-house they saw also\r\nthe so-called table of the Sun:\r\n\r\n24, and after this they saw last of all their receptacles of dead\r\nbodies, which are said to be made of crystal in the following\r\nmanner:—when they have dried the corpse, whether it be after the\r\nEgyptian fashion or in some other way, they cover it over completely\r\nwith plaster 21 and then adorn it with painting, making the figure as\r\nfar as possible like the living man. After this they put about it a\r\nblock of crystal hollowed out; for this they dig up in great quantity\r\nand it is very easy to work: and the dead body being in the middle of\r\nthe block is visible through it, but produces no unpleasant smell nor\r\nany other effect which is unseemly, and it has all its parts visible\r\nlike the dead body itself. For a year then they who are most nearly\r\nrelated to the man keep the block in their house, giving to the dead man\r\nthe first share of everything and offering to him sacrifices: and after\r\nthis period they carry it out and set it up round about the city.\r\n\r\n25. After they had seen all, the spies departed to go back; and when\r\nthey reported these things, forthwith Cambyses was enraged and proceeded\r\nto march his army against the Ethiopians, not having ordered any\r\nprovision of food nor considered with himself that he was intending to\r\nmarch an army to the furthest extremities of the earth; but as one who\r\nis mad and not in his right senses, when he heard the report of the\r\nIchthyophagoi he began the march, ordering those of the Hellenes who\r\nwere present to remain behind in Egypt, and taking with him his whole\r\nland force: and when in the course of his march he had arrived at\r\nThebes, he divided off about fifty thousand of his army, and these he\r\nenjoined to make slaves of the Ammonians and to set fire to the seat of\r\nthe Oracle of Zeus, but he himself with the remainder of his army went\r\non against the Ethiopians. But before the army had passed over the\r\nfifth part of the way, all that they had of provisions came to an end\r\ncompletely; and then after the provisions the beasts of burden also were\r\neaten up and came to an end. Now if Cambyses when he perceived this had\r\nchanged his plan and led his army back, he would have been a wise man\r\nin spite of 22 his first mistake; as it was, however, he paid no regard,\r\nbut went on forward without stopping. The soldiers accordingly, so long\r\nas they were able to get anything from the ground, prolonged their lives\r\nby eating grass; but when they came to the sand, some did a fearful\r\ndeed, that is to say, out of each company of ten they selected by lot\r\none of themselves and devoured him: and Cambyses, when he heard it,\r\nbeing alarmed by this eating of one another gave up the expedition\r\nagainst the Ethiopians and set forth to go back again; and he arrived\r\nat Thebes having suffered loss of a great number of his army. Then from\r\nThebes he came down to Memphis and allowed the Hellenes to sail away\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n26. Thus fared the expedition against the Ethiopians: and those of the\r\nPersians who had been sent to march against the Ammonians set forth\r\nfrom Thebes and went on their way with guides; and it is known that they\r\narrived at the city of Oasis, which is inhabited by Samians said to\r\nbe of the Aischrionian tribe, and is distant seven days' journey from\r\nThebes over sandy desert: now this place is called in the speech of the\r\nHellenes the \"Isle of the Blessed.\" It is said that the army reached\r\nthis place, but from that point onwards, except the Ammonians themselves\r\nand those who have heard the account from them, no man is able to say\r\nanything about them; for they neither reached the Ammonians nor\r\nreturned back. This however is added to the story by the Ammonians\r\nthemselves:—they say that as the army was going from this Oasis through\r\nthe sandy desert to attack them, and had got to a point about mid-way\r\nbetween them and the Oasis, while they were taking their morning meal\r\na violent South Wind blew upon them, and bearing with it heaps of the\r\ndesert sand it buried them under it, and so they disappeared and were\r\nseen no more. Thus the Ammonians say that it came to pass with regard to\r\nthis army.\r\n\r\n27. When Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis appeared to the Egyptians,\r\nwhom the Hellenes call Epaphos: and when he had appeared, forthwith the\r\nEgyptians began to wear their fairest garments and to have festivities.\r\nCambyses accordingly seeing the Egyptians doing thus, and supposing that\r\nthey were certainly acting so by way of rejoicing because he had fared\r\nill, called for the officers who had charge of Memphis; and when they\r\nhad come into his presence, he asked them why when he was at Memphis on\r\nthe former occasion, the Egyptians were doing nothing of this kind, but\r\nonly now, when he came there after losing a large part of his army.\r\nThey said that a god had appeared to them, who was wont to appear at\r\nintervals of long time, and that whenever he appeared, then all the\r\nEgyptians rejoiced and kept festival. Hearing this Cambyses said that\r\nthey were lying, and as liars he condemned them to death.\r\n\r\n28. Having put these to death, next he called the priests into his\r\npresence; and when the priests answered him after the same manner, he\r\nsaid that it should not be without his knowledge if a tame god had come\r\nto the Egyptians; and having so said he bade the priests bring Apis away\r\ninto his presence: so they went to bring him. Now this Apis-Epaphos is a\r\ncalf born of a cow who after this is not permitted to conceive any other\r\noffspring; and the Egyptians say that a flash of light comes down from\r\nheaven upon this cow, and of this she produces Apis. This calf which is\r\ncalled Apis is black and has the following signs, namely a white square\r\n23 upon the forehead, and on the back the likeness of an eagle, and in\r\nthe tail the hairs are double, and on 24 the tongue there is a mark like\r\na beetle.\r\n\r\n29. When the priests had brought Apis, Cambyses being somewhat affected\r\nwith madness drew his dagger, and aiming at the belly of Apis, struck\r\nhis thigh: then he laughed and said to the priests: \"O ye wretched\r\ncreatures, are gods born such as this, with blood and flesh, and\r\nsensible of the stroke of iron weapons? Worthy indeed of Egyptians\r\nis such a god as this. Ye however at least shall not escape without\r\npunishment for making a mock of me.\" Having thus spoken he ordered those\r\nwhose duty it was to do such things, to scourge the priests without\r\nmercy, and to put to death any one of the other Egyptians whom they\r\nshould find keeping the festival. Thus the festival of the Egyptians had\r\nbeen brought to an end, and the priests were being chastised, and Apis\r\nwounded by the stroke in his thigh lay dying in the temple.\r\n\r\n30. Him, when he had brought his life to an end by reason of the wound,\r\nthe priests buried without the knowledge of Cambyses: but Cambyses, as\r\nthe Egyptians say, immediately after this evil deed became absolutely\r\nmad, not having been really in his right senses even before that time:\r\nand the first of his evil deeds was that he put to death his brother\r\nSmerdis, who was of the same father and the same mother as himself. This\r\nbrother he had sent away from Egypt to Persia in envy, because alone\r\nof all the Persians he had been able to draw the bow which the\r\nIchthyophagoi brought from the Ethiopian king, to an extent of about two\r\nfinger-breadths; while of the other Persians not one had proved able\r\nto do this. Then when Smerdis had gone away to Persia, Cambyses saw a\r\nvision in his sleep of this kind:—it seemed to him that a messenger came\r\nfrom Persia and reported that Smerdis sitting upon the royal throne had\r\ntouched the heaven with his head. Fearing therefore with regard to\r\nthis lest his brother might slay him and reign in his stead, he sent\r\nPrexaspes to Persia, the man whom of all the Persians he trusted most,\r\nwith command to slay him. He accordingly went up to Susa and slew\r\nSmerdis; and some say that he took him out of the chase and so slew him,\r\nothers that he brought him to the Erythraian Sea and drowned him.\r\n\r\n31. This they say was the first beginning of the evil deeds of Cambyses;\r\nand next after this he put to death his sister, who had accompanied\r\nhim to Egypt, to whom also he was married, she being his sister by both\r\nparents. Now he took her to wife in the following manner (for\r\nbefore this the Persians had not been wont at all to marry their\r\nsisters):—Cambyses fell in love with one of his sisters, and desired to\r\ntake her to wife; so since he had it in mind to do that which was not\r\ncustomary, he called the Royal Judges and asked them whether there\r\nexisted any law which permitted him who desired it to marry his sister.\r\nNow the Royal Judges are men chosen out from among the Persians, and\r\nhold their office until they die or until some injustice is found in\r\nthem, so long and no longer. These pronounce decisions for the Persians\r\nand are the expounders of the ordinances of their fathers, and all\r\nmatters are referred to them. So when Cambyses asked them, they gave him\r\nan answer which was both upright and safe, saying that they found no law\r\nwhich permitted a brother to marry his sister, but apart from that they\r\nhad found a law to the effect that the king of the Persians might do\r\nwhatsoever he desired. Thus on the one hand they did not tamper with\r\nthe law for fear of Cambyses, and at the same time, that they might not\r\nperish themselves in maintaining the law, they found another law beside\r\nthat which was asked for, which was in favour of him who wished to marry\r\nhis sisters. So Cambyses at that time took to wife her with whom he was\r\nin love, but after no long time he took another sister. Of these it was\r\nthe younger whom he put to death, she having accompanied him to Egypt.\r\n\r\n32. About her death, as about the death of Smerdis, two different\r\nstories are told. The Hellenes say that Cambyses had matched a lion's\r\ncub in fight with a dog's whelp, and this wife of his was also a\r\nspectator of it; and when the whelp was being overcome, another whelp,\r\nits brother, broke its chain and came to help it; and having become two\r\ninstead of one, the whelps then got the better of the cub: and Cambyses\r\nwas pleased at the sight, but she sitting by him began to weep; and\r\nCambyses perceived it and asked wherefore she wept; and she said that\r\nshe had wept when she saw that the whelp had come to the assistance of\r\nits brother, because she remembered Smerdis and perceived that there was\r\nno one who would come to his 25 assistance. The Hellenes say that it was\r\nfor this saying that she was killed by Cambyses: but the Egyptians say\r\nthat as they were sitting round at table, the wife took a lettuce and\r\npulled off the leaves all round, and then asked her husband whether the\r\nlettuce was fairer when thus plucked round or when covered with\r\nleaves, and he said \"when covered with leaves\": she then spoke thus:\r\n\"Nevertheless thou didst once produce the likeness of this lettuce, when\r\nthou didst strip bare the house of Cyrus.\" And he moved to anger leapt\r\nupon her, being with child, and she miscarried and died.\r\n\r\n33. These were the acts of madness done by Cambyses towards those of his\r\nown family, whether the madness was produced really on account of Apis\r\nor from some other cause, as many ills are wont to seize upon men; for\r\nit is said moreover that Cambyses had from his birth a certain grievous\r\nmalady, that which is called by some the \"sacred\" disease: 26 and it\r\nwas certainly nothing strange that when the body was suffering from a\r\ngrievous malady, the mind should not be sound either.\r\n\r\n34. The following also are acts of madness which he did to the other\r\nPersians:—To Prexaspes, the man whom he honoured most and who used to\r\nbear his messages 2601 (his son also was cup-bearer to Cambyses, and\r\nthis too was no small honour),—to him it is said that he spoke as\r\nfollows: \"Prexaspes, what kind of a man do the Persians esteem me to be,\r\nand what speech do they hold concerning me?\" and he said: \"Master, in\r\nall other respects thou art greatly commended, but they say that thou\r\nart overmuch given to love of wine.\" Thus he spoke concerning the\r\nPersians; and upon that Cambyses was roused to anger, and answered thus:\r\n\"It appears then that the Persians say I am given to wine, and that\r\ntherefore I am beside myself and not in my right mind; and their former\r\nspeech then was not sincere.\" For before this time, it seems, when the\r\nPersians and Croesus were sitting with him in council, Cambyses asked\r\nwhat kind of a man they thought he was as compared with his father\r\nCyrus; 27 and they answered that he was better than his father, for\r\nhe not only possessed all that his father had possessed, but also in\r\naddition to this had acquired Egypt and the Sea. Thus the Persians\r\nspoke; but Croesus, who was present and was not satisfied with their\r\njudgment, spoke thus to Cambyses: \"To me, O son of Cyrus, thou dost not\r\nappear to be equal to thy father, for not yet hast thou a son such as\r\nhe left behind him in you.\" Hearing this Cambyses was pleased, and\r\ncommended the judgment of Croesus.\r\n\r\n35. So calling to mind this, he said in anger to Prexaspes: \"Learn then\r\nnow for thyself whether the Persians speak truly, or whether when they\r\nsay this they are themselves out of their senses: for if I, shooting at\r\nthy son there standing before the entrance of the chamber, hit him in\r\nthe very middle of the heart, the Persians will be proved to be speaking\r\nfalsely, but if I miss, then thou mayest say that the Persians are\r\nspeaking the truth and that I am not in my right mind.\" Having thus said\r\nhe drew his bow and hit the boy; and when the boy had fallen down, it\r\nis said that he ordered them to cut open his body and examine the place\r\nwhere he was hit; and as the arrow was found to be sticking in the\r\nheart, he laughed and was delighted, and said to the father of the boy:\r\n\"Prexaspes, it has now been made evident, as thou seest, that I am not\r\nmad, but that it is the Persians who are out of their senses; and now\r\ntell me, whom of all men didst thou ever see before this time hit the\r\nmark so well in shooting?\" Then Prexaspes, seeing that the man was not\r\nin his right senses and fearing for himself, said: \"Master, I think that\r\nnot even God himself could have hit the mark so fairly.\" Thus he did at\r\nthat time: and at another time he condemned twelve of the Persians, men\r\nequal to the best, on a charge of no moment, and buried them alive with\r\nthe head downwards.\r\n\r\n36. When he was doing these things, Croesus the Lydian judged it right\r\nto admonish him in the following words: \"O king, do not thou indulge the\r\nheat of thy youth and passion in all things, but retain and hold thyself\r\nback: it is a good thing to be prudent, and forethought is wise. Thou\r\nhowever are putting to death men who are of thine own people, condemning\r\nthem on charges of no moment, and thou art putting to death men's sons\r\nalso. If thou do many such things, beware lest the Persians make revolt\r\nfrom thee. As for me, thy father Cyrus gave me charge, earnestly bidding\r\nme to admonish thee, and suggest to thee that which I should find to\r\nbe good.\" Thus he counselled him, manifesting goodwill towards him; but\r\nCambyses answered: \"Dost thou venture to counsel me, who excellently\r\nwell didst rule thine own country, and well didst counsel my father,\r\nbidding him pass over the river Araxes and go against the Massagetai,\r\nwhen they were willing to pass over into our land, and so didst utterly\r\nruin thyself by ill government of thine own land, and didst utterly\r\nruin Cyrus, who followed thy counsel. However thou shalt not escape\r\npunishment now, for know that before this I had very long been desiring\r\nto find some occasion against thee.\" Thus having said he took his bow\r\nmeaning to shoot him, but Croesus started up and ran out: and so since\r\nhe could not shoot him, he gave orders to his attendants to take and\r\nslay him. The attendants however, knowing his moods, concealed Croesus,\r\nwith the intention that if Cambyses should change his mind and seek\r\nto have Croesus again, they might produce him and receive gifts as the\r\nprice of saving his life; but if he did not change his mind nor feel\r\ndesire to have him back, then they might kill him. Not long afterwards\r\nCambyses did in fact desire to have Croesus again, and the attendants\r\nperceiving this reported to him that he was still alive: and Cambyses\r\nsaid that he rejoiced with Croesus that he was still alive, but that\r\nthey who had preserved him should not get off free, but he would put\r\nthem to death: and thus he did.\r\n\r\n37. Many such acts of madness did he both to Persians and allies,\r\nremaining at Memphis and opening ancient tombs and examining the dead\r\nbodies. Likewise also he entered into the temple of Hephaistos and very\r\nmuch derided the image of the god: for the image of Hephaistos very\r\nnearly resembles the Phenician Pataicoi, which the Phenicians carry\r\nabout on the prows of their triremes; and for him who has not seen\r\nthese, I will indicate its nature,—it is the likeness of a dwarfish man.\r\nHe entered also into the temple of the Cabeiroi, into which it is not\r\nlawful for any one to enter except the priest only, and the images there\r\nhe even set on fire, after much mockery of them. Now these also are like\r\nthe images of Hephaistos, and it is said that they are the children of\r\nthat god.\r\n\r\n38. It is clear to me therefore by every kind of proof that Cambyses\r\nwas mad exceedingly; for otherwise he would not have attempted to deride\r\nreligious rites and customary observances. For if one should propose\r\nto all men a choice, bidding them select the best customs from all the\r\ncustoms that there are, each race of men, after examining them all,\r\nwould select those of his own people; thus all think that their own\r\ncustoms are by far the best: and so it is not likely that any but a\r\nmadman would make a jest of such things. Now of the fact that all men\r\nare thus wont to think about their customs, we may judge by many other\r\nproofs and more specially by this which follows:—Dareios in the course\r\nof his reign summoned those of the Hellenes who were present in his\r\nland, and asked them for what price they would consent to eat up their\r\nfathers when they died; and they answered that for no price would\r\nthey do so. After this Dareios summoned those Indians who are called\r\nCallatians, who eat their parents, and asked them in presence of the\r\nHellenes, who understood what they said by help of an interpreter, for\r\nwhat payment they would consent to consume with fire the bodies of\r\ntheir fathers when they died; and they cried out aloud and bade him\r\nkeep silence from such words. Thus then these things are established by\r\nusage, and I think that Pindar spoke rightly in his verse, when he said\r\nthat \"of all things law is king.\" 28\r\n\r\n39. Now while Cambyses was marching upon Egypt, the Lacedemonians also\r\nhad made an expedition against Samos and against Polycrates the son\r\nof Aiakes, who had risen against the government and obtained rule over\r\nSamos. At first he had divided the State into three parts and had given\r\na share to his brothers Pantagnotos and Syloson; but afterwards he put\r\nto death one of these, and the younger, namely Syloson, he drove\r\nout, and so obtained possession of the whole of Samos. Then, being in\r\npossession, 29 he made a guest-friendship with Amasis the king of Egypt,\r\nsending him gifts and receiving gifts in return from him. After this\r\nstraightway within a short period of time the power of Polycrates\r\nincreased rapidly, and there was much fame of it not only in Ionia,\r\nbut also over the rest of Hellas: for to whatever part he directed his\r\nforces, everything went fortunately for him: and he had got for himself\r\na hundred fifty-oared galleys and a thousand archers, and he plundered\r\nfrom all, making no distinction of any; for it was his wont to say that\r\nhe would win more gratitude from his friend by giving back to him that\r\nwhich he had taken, than by not taking at all. 30 So he had conquered\r\nmany of the islands and also many cities of the continent, and besides\r\nother things he gained the victory in a sea-fight over the Lesbians, as\r\nthey were coming to help the Milesians with their forces, and conquered\r\nthem: these men dug the whole trench round the wall of the city of Samos\r\nworking in chains.\r\n\r\n40. Now Amasis, as may be supposed, did not fail to perceive that\r\nPolycrates was very greatly fortunate, and 31 it was to him an object\r\nof concern; and as much more good fortune yet continued to come to\r\nPolycrates, he wrote upon a paper these words and sent them to Samos:\r\n\"Amasis to Polycrates thus saith:—It is a pleasant thing indeed to hear\r\nthat one who is a friend and guest is faring well; yet to me thy great\r\ngood fortune is not pleasing, since I know that the Divinity is jealous;\r\nand I think that I desire, both for myself and for those about whom I\r\nhave care, that in some of our affairs we should be prosperous and in\r\nothers should fail, and thus go through life alternately faring 32 well\r\nand ill, rather than that we should be prosperous in all things: for\r\nnever yet did I hear tell of any one who was prosperous in all things\r\nand did not come to an utterly 33 evil end at the last. Now therefore\r\ndo thou follow my counsel and act as I shall say with respect to thy\r\nprosperous fortunes. Take thought and consider, and that which thou\r\nfindest to be the most valued by thee, and for the loss of which thou\r\nwilt most be vexed in thy soul, that take and cast away in such a manner\r\nthat it shall never again come to the sight of men; and if in future\r\nfrom that time forward good fortune does not befall thee in alternation\r\nwith calamities, 34 apply remedies in the manner by me suggested.\"\r\n\r\n41. Polycrates, having read this and having perceived by reflection that\r\nAmasis suggested to him good counsel, sought to find which one of his\r\ntreasures he would be most afflicted in his soul to lose; and seeking\r\nhe found this which I shall say:—he had a signet which he used to wear,\r\nenchased in gold and made of an emerald stone; and it was the work of\r\nTheodoros the son of Telecles of Samos. 35 Seeing then that he thought\r\nit good to cast this away, he did thus:—he manned a fifty-oared galley\r\nwith sailors and went on board of it himself; and then he bade them\r\nput out into the deep sea. And when he had got to a distance from the\r\nisland, he took off the signet-ring, and in the sight of all who were\r\nwith him in the ship he threw it into the sea. Thus having done he\r\nsailed home; and when he came to his house he mourned for his loss.\r\n\r\n42. But on the fifth or sixth day after these things it happened to\r\nhim as follows:—a fisherman having caught a large and beautiful fish,\r\nthought it right that this should be given as a gift to Polycrates. He\r\nbore it therefore to the door of the palace and said that he desired to\r\ncome into the presence of Polycrates, and when he had obtained this he\r\ngave him the fish, saying: \"O king, having taken this fish I did not\r\nthink fit to bear it to the market, although I am one who lives by the\r\nlabour of his hands; but it seemed to me that it was worthy of thee and\r\nof thy monarchy: therefore I bring it and present it to thee.\" He\r\nthen, being pleased at the words spoken, answered thus: \"Thou didst\r\nexceedingly well, and double thanks are due to thee, for thy words and\r\nalso for thy gift; and we invite thee to come to dinner.\" The fisherman\r\nthen, thinking this a great thing, went away to this house; and the\r\nservants as they were cutting up the fish found in its belly the\r\nsignet-ring of Polycrates. Then as soon as they had seen it and taken it\r\nup, they bore it rejoicing to Polycrates, and giving him the signet-ring\r\nthey told him in what manner it had been found: and he perceiving that\r\nthe matter was of God, wrote upon paper all that he had done and all\r\nthat had happened to him, and having written he despatched it to Egypt.\r\n36\r\n\r\n43. Then Amasis, when he had read the paper which had come from\r\nPolycrates, perceived that it was impossible for man to rescue man from\r\nthe event which was to come to pass, and that Polycrates was destined\r\nnot to have a good end, being prosperous in all things, seeing that he\r\nfound again even that which he cast away. Therefore he sent an envoy to\r\nhim in Samos and said that he broke off the guest-friendship; and this\r\nhe did lest when a fearful and great mishap befell Polycrates, he might\r\nhimself be grieved in his soul as for a man who was his guest.\r\n\r\n44. It was this Polycrates then, prosperous in all things, against whom\r\nthe Lacedemonians were making an expedition, being invited by those\r\nSamians who afterwards settled at Kydonia in Crete, to come to their\r\nassistance. Now Polycrates had sent an envoy to Cambyses the son of\r\nCyrus without the knowledge of the Samians, as he was gathering an army\r\nto go against Egypt, and had asked him to send to him in Samos and to\r\nask for an armed force. So Cambyses hearing this very readily sent to\r\nSamos to ask Polycrates to send a naval force with him against Egypt:\r\nand Polycrates selected of the citizens those whom he most suspected\r\nof desiring to rise against him and sent them away in forty triremes,\r\ncharging Cambyses not to send them back.\r\n\r\n45. Now some say that those of the Samians who were sent away by\r\nPolycrates never reached Egypt, but when they arrived on their voyage at\r\nCarpathos, 37 they considered with themselves, and resolved not to sail\r\non any further: others say that they reached Egypt and being kept under\r\nguard there, they made their escape from thence. Then, as they were\r\nsailing in to Samos, Polycrates encountered them with ships and engaged\r\nbattle with them; and those who were returning home had the better and\r\nlanded in the island; but having fought a land-battle in the island,\r\nthey were worsted, and so sailed to Lacedemon. Some however say that\r\nthose from Egypt defeated Polycrates in the battle; but this in my\r\nopinion is not correct, for there would have been no need for them to\r\ninvite the assistance of the Lacedemonians if they had been able by\r\nthemselves to bring Polycrates to terms. Moreover, it is not reasonable\r\neither, seeing that he had foreign mercenaries and native archers very\r\nmany in number, to suppose that he was worsted by the returning Samians,\r\nwho were but few. Then Polycrates gathered together the children and\r\nwives of his subjects and confined them in the ship-sheds, keeping them\r\nready so that, if it should prove that his subjects deserted to the side\r\nof the returning exiles, he might burn them with the sheds.\r\n\r\n46. When those of the Samians who had been driven out by Polycrates\r\nreached Sparta, they were introduced before the magistrates and spoke\r\nat length, being urgent in their request. The magistrates however at the\r\nfirst introduction replied that they had forgotten the things which had\r\nbeen spoken at the beginning, and did not understand those which were\r\nspoken at the end. After this they were introduced a second time, and\r\nbringing with them a bag they said nothing else but this, namely that\r\nthe bag was in want of meal; to which the others replied that they had\r\noverdone it with the bag. 38 However, they resolved to help them.\r\n\r\n47. Then the Lacedemonians prepared a force and made expedition to\r\nSamos, in repayment of former services, as the Samians say, because the\r\nSamians had first helped them with ships against the Messenians; but the\r\nLacedemonians say that they made the expedition not so much from desire\r\nto help the Samians at their request, as to take vengeance on their own\r\nbehalf for the robbery of the mixing-bowl which they had been bearing as\r\na gift to Croesus, 39 and of the corslet which Amasis the king of Egypt\r\nhad sent as a gift to them; for the Samians had carried off the corslet\r\nalso in the year before they took the bowl; and it was of linen with\r\nmany figures woven into it and embroidered with gold and with cotton;\r\nand each thread of this corslet is worthy of admiration, for that being\r\nitself fine it has in it three hundred and sixty fibres, all plain to\r\nview. Such another as this moreover is that which Amasis dedicated as an\r\noffering to Athene at Lindos.\r\n\r\n48. The Corinthians also took part with zeal in this expedition against\r\nSamos, that it might be carried out; for there had been an offence\r\nperpetrated against them also by the Samians a generation before 40 the\r\ntime of this expedition and about the same time as the robbery of the\r\nbowl. Periander the son of Kypselos had despatched three hundred sons of\r\nthe chief men of Corcyra to Alyattes at Sardis to be made eunuchs; and\r\nwhen the Corinthians who were conducting the boys had put in to Samos,\r\nthe Samians, being informed of the story and for what purpose they were\r\nbeing conducted to Sardis, first instructed the boys to lay hold of the\r\ntemple of Artemis, and then they refused to permit the Corinthians to\r\ndrag the suppliants away from the temple: and as the Corinthians cut the\r\nboys off from supplies of food, the Samians made a festival, which they\r\ncelebrate even to the present time in the same manner: for when night\r\ncame on, as long as the boys were suppliants they arranged dances of\r\nmaidens and youths, and in arranging the dances they made it a rule of\r\nthe festival that sweet cakes of sesame and honey should be carried, in\r\norder that the Corcyrean boys might snatch them and so have support; and\r\nthis went on so long that at last the Corinthians who had charge of the\r\nboys departed and went away; and as for the boys, the Samians carried\r\nthem back to Corcyra.\r\n\r\n49. Now, if after the death of Periander the Corinthians had been on\r\nfriendly terms with the Corcyreans, they would not have joined in the\r\nexpedition against Samos for the cause which has been mentioned; but as\r\nit is, they have been ever at variance with one another since they first\r\ncolonised the island. 41 This then was the cause why the Corinthians had\r\na grudge against the Samians.\r\n\r\n50. Now Periander had chosen out the sons of the chief men of Corcyra\r\nand was sending them to Sardis to be made eunuchs, in order that he\r\nmight have revenge; since the Corcyreans had first begun the offence and\r\nhad done to him a deed of reckless wrong. For after Periander had killed\r\nhis wife Melissa, it chanced to him to experience another misfortune\r\nin addition to that which had happened to him already, and this was as\r\nfollows:—He had by Melissa two sons, the one of seventeen and the other\r\nof eighteen years. These sons their mother's father Procles, who was\r\ndespot of Epidauros, sent for to himself and kindly entertained, as was\r\nto be expected seeing that they were the sons of his own daughter; and\r\nwhen he was sending them back, he said in taking leave of them: \"Do\r\nye know, boys, who it was that killed your mother?\" Of this saying\r\nthe elder of them took no account, but the younger, whose name was\r\nLycophron, was grieved so greatly at hearing it, that when he reached\r\nCorinth again he would neither address his father, nor speak to him when\r\nhis father would have conversed with him, nor give any reply when he\r\nasked questions, regarding him as the murderer of his mother. At length\r\nPeriander being enraged with his son drove him forth out of his house.\r\n\r\n51. And having driven him forth, he asked of the elder son what his\r\nmother's father had said to them in his conversation. He then related\r\nhow Procles had received them in a kindly manner, but of the saying\r\nwhich he had uttered when he parted from them he had no remembrance,\r\nsince he had taken no note of it. So Periander said that it could not be\r\nbut that he had suggested to them something, and urged him further with\r\nquestions; and he after that remembered, and told of this also. Then\r\nPeriander taking note of it 42 and not desiring to show any indulgence,\r\nsent a messenger to those with whom the son who had been driven forth\r\nwas living at that time, and forbade them to receive him into their\r\nhouses; and whenever having been driven away from one house he came to\r\nanother, he was driven away also from this, since Periander threatened\r\nthose who received him, and commanded them to exclude him; and so being\r\ndriven away again he would go to another house, where persons lived who\r\nwere his friends, and they perhaps received him because he was the son\r\nof Periander, notwithstanding that they feared.\r\n\r\n52. At last Periander made a proclamation that whosoever should either\r\nreceive him into their houses or converse with him should be bound\r\nto pay a fine 43 to Apollo, stating the amount that it should be.\r\nAccordingly, by reason of this proclamation no one was willing either to\r\nconverse with him or to receive him into their house; and moreover\r\neven he himself did not think it fit to attempt it, since it had been\r\nforbidden, but he lay about in the porticoes enduring exposure: and\r\non the fourth day after this, Periander seeing him fallen into squalid\r\nmisery and starvation felt pity for him; and abating his anger he\r\napproached him and began to say: \"Son, which of these two is to be\r\npreferred, the fortune which thou dost now experience and possess, 44 or\r\nto inherit the power and wealth which I possess now, by being submissive\r\nto thy father's will? Thou however, being my son and the prince 45 of\r\nwealthy Corinth, didst choose nevertheless the life of a vagabond by\r\nmaking opposition and displaying anger against him with whom it behoved\r\nthee least to deal so; for if any misfortune happened in those matters,\r\nfor which cause thou hast suspicion against me, this has happened to me\r\nfirst, and I am sharer in the misfortune more than others, inasmuch as I\r\ndid the deed 46 myself. Do thou however, having learnt by how much to be\r\nenvied is better than to be pitied, and at the same time what a grievous\r\nthing it is to be angry against thy parents and against those who are\r\nstronger than thou, come back now to the house.\" Periander with these\r\nwords endeavoured to restrain him; but he answered nothing else to his\r\nfather, but said only that he ought to pay a fine to the god for having\r\ncome to speech with him. Then Periander, perceiving that the malady of\r\nhis son was hopeless and could not be overcome, despatched a ship to\r\nCorcyra, and so sent him away out of his sight, for he was ruler also of\r\nthat island; and having sent him away, Periander proceeded to make war\r\nagainst his father-in-law Procles, esteeming him most to blame for the\r\ncondition in which he was; and he took Epidauros and took also Procles\r\nhimself and made him a prisoner.\r\n\r\n53. When however, as time went on, Periander had passed his prime and\r\nperceived within himself that he was no longer able to overlook and\r\nmanage the government of the State, he sent to Corcyra and summoned\r\nLycophron to come back and take the supreme power; for in the elder of\r\nhis sons he did not see the required capacity, but perceived clearly\r\nthat he was of wits too dull. Lycophron however did not deign even to\r\ngive an answer to the bearer of his message. Then Periander, clinging\r\nstill in affection to the youth, sent to him next his own daughter, the\r\nsister of Lycophron, supposing that he would yield to her persuasion\r\nmore than to that of others; and she arrived there and spoke to him\r\nthus: \"Boy, dost thou desire that both the despotism should fall to\r\nothers, and also the substance of thy father, carried off as plunder,\r\nrather than that thou shouldest return back and possess them? Come\r\nback to thy home: cease to torment thyself. Pride is a mischievous\r\npossession. Heal not evil with evil. Many prefer that which is\r\nreasonable to that which is strictly just; and many ere now in seeking\r\nthe things of their mother have lost the things of their father.\r\nDespotism is an insecure thing, and many desire it: moreover he is now\r\nan old man and past his prime. Give not thy good things unto others.\"\r\nShe thus said to him the most persuasive things, having been before\r\ninstructed by her father: but he in answer said, that he would never\r\ncome to Corinth so long as he heard that his father was yet alive. When\r\nshe had reported this, Periander the third time sent an envoy, and said\r\nthat he desired himself to come to Corcyra, exhorting Lycophron at the\r\nsame time to come back to Corinth and to be his successor on the throne.\r\nThe son having agreed to return on these terms, Periander was preparing\r\nto sail to Corcyra and his son to Corinth; but the Corcyreans, having\r\nlearnt all that had taken place, put the young man to death, in order\r\nthat Periander might not come to their land. For this cause it was that\r\nPeriander took vengeance on those of Corcyra.\r\n\r\n54. The Lacedemonians then had come with a great armament and were\r\nbesieging Samos; and having made an attack upon the wall, they occupied\r\nthe tower which stands by the sea in the suburb of the city, but\r\nafterwards when Polycrates came up to the rescue with a large body they\r\nwere driven away from it. Meanwhile by the upper tower which is upon\r\nthe ridge of the mountain there had come out to the fight the foreign\r\nmercenaries and many of the Samians themselves, and these stood their\r\nground against the Lacedemonians for a short while and then began to fly\r\nbackwards; and the Lacedemonians followed and were slaying them.\r\n\r\n55. Now if the Lacedemonians there present had all been equal on that\r\nday to Archias and Lycopas, Samos would have been captured; for Archias\r\nand Lycopas alone rushed within the wall together with the flying\r\nSamians, and being shut off from retreat were slain within the city of\r\nthe Samians. I myself moreover had converse in Pitane (for to that\r\ndeme he belonged) with the third in descent from this Archias, another\r\nArchias the son of Samios the son of Archias, who honoured the Samians\r\nof all strangers most; and not only so, but he said that his own father\r\nhad been called Samios because his father Archias had died by a glorious\r\ndeath in Samos; and he said that he honoured Samians because his\r\ngrandfather had been granted a public funeral by the Samians.\r\n\r\n56. The Lacedemonians then, when they had been besieging Samos for\r\nforty days and their affairs made no progress, set forth to return to\r\nPeloponnesus. But according to the less credible account which has been\r\nput abroad of these matters Polycrates struck in lead a quantity of a\r\ncertain native coin, and having gilded the coins over, gave them to the\r\nLacedemonians, and they received them and upon that set forth to depart.\r\nThis was the first expedition which the Lacedemonians (being Dorians)\r\n4601 made into Asia.\r\n\r\n57. Those of the Samians who had made the expedition against Polycrates\r\nthemselves also sailed away, when the Lacedemonians were about to desert\r\nthem, and came to Siphnos: for they were in want of money, and the\r\npeople of Siphnos were then at their greatest height of prosperity and\r\npossessed wealth more than all the other islanders, since they had\r\nin their island mines of gold and silver, so that there is a treasury\r\ndedicated at Delphi with the tithe of the money which came in from\r\nthese mines, and furnished in a manner equal to the wealthiest of these\r\ntreasuries: and the people used to divide among themselves the money\r\nwhich came in from the mines every year. So when they were establishing\r\nthe treasury, they consulted the Oracle as to whether their present\r\nprosperity was capable of remaining with them for a long time, and the\r\nPythian prophetess gave them this reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"But when with white shall be shining 47 the hall of the city 48\r\n    in Siphnos,\r\n  And when the market is white of brow, one wary is needed\r\n  Then, to beware of an army 49 of wood and a red-coloured herald.\"\r\n\r\nNow just at that time the market-place and city hall of the Siphnians\r\nhad been decorated with Parian marble.\r\n\r\n58. This oracle they were not able to understand either then at first or\r\nwhen the Samians had arrived: for as soon as the Samians were putting in\r\n50 to Siphnos they sent one of their ships to bear envoys to the city:\r\nnow in old times all ships were painted with red, and this was that\r\nwhich the Pythian prophetess was declaring beforehand to the Siphnians,\r\nbidding them guard against the \"army of wood\" and the \"red-coloured\r\nherald.\" The messengers accordingly came and asked the Siphnians to lend\r\nthem ten talents; and as they refused to lend to them, the Samians began\r\nto lay waste their lands: so when they were informed of it, forthwith\r\nthe Siphnians came to the rescue, and having engaged battle with them\r\nwere defeated, and many of them were cut off by the Samians and shut out\r\nof the city; and the Samians after this imposed upon them a payment of a\r\nhundred talents.\r\n\r\n59. Then from the men of Hermion they received by payment of money the\r\nisland of Hydrea, which is near the coast of Peloponnese, and they gave\r\nit in charge to the Troizenians, but they themselves settled at Kydonia\r\nwhich is in Crete, not sailing thither for that purpose but in order\r\nto drive the Zakynthians out of the island. Here they remained and were\r\nprosperous for five years, so much so that they were the builders of\r\nthe temples which are now existing in Kydonia, and also of the house of\r\nDictyna. 51 In the sixth year however the Eginetans together with the\r\nCretans conquered them in a sea-fight and brought them to slavery; and\r\nthey cut off the prows of their ships, which were shaped like boars, and\r\ndedicated them in the temple of Athene in Egina. This the Eginetans did\r\nbecause they had a grudge against the Samians; for the Samians had first\r\nmade expedition against Egina, when Amphicrates was king in Samos, and\r\nhad done much hurt to the Eginetans and suffered much hurt also from\r\nthem. Such was the cause of this event:\r\n\r\n60, and about the Samians I have spoken at greater length, because they\r\nhave three works which are greater than any others that have been made\r\nby Hellenes: first a passage beginning from below and open at both ends,\r\ndug through a mountain not less than a hundred and fifty fathoms 52 in\r\nheight; the length of the passage is seven furlongs 53 and the height\r\nand breadth each eight feet, and throughout the whole of it another\r\npassage has been dug twenty cubits in depth and three feet in breadth,\r\nthrough which the water is conducted and comes by the pipes to the city,\r\nbrought from an abundant spring: and the designer of this work was a\r\nMegarian, Eupalinos the son of Naustrophos. This is one of the three;\r\nand the second is a mole in the sea about the harbour, going down to\r\na depth of as much as 54 twenty fathoms; and the length of the mole is\r\nmore than two furlongs. The third work which they have executed is a\r\ntemple larger than all the other temples of which we know. Of this the\r\nfirst designer was Rhoicos the son of Philes, a native of Samos. For\r\nthis reason I have spoken at greater length of the Samians.\r\n\r\n61. Now while Cambyses the son of Cyrus was spending a long time in\r\nEgypt and had gone out of his right mind, there rose up against him two\r\nbrothers, Magians, of whom the one had been left behind by Cambyses\r\nas caretaker of his household. This man, I say, rose up against him\r\nperceiving that the occurrence of the death of Smerdis was being kept\r\nsecret, and that there were but few of the Persians who were aware of\r\nit, while the greater number believed without doubt that he was still\r\nalive. Therefore he endeavoured to obtain the kingdom, and he formed his\r\nplan as follows:—he had a brother (that one who, as I said, rose up\r\nwith him against Cambyses), and this man in form very closely resembled\r\nSmerdis the son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses had slain, being his own\r\nbrother. He was like Smerdis, I say, in form, and not only so but he had\r\nthe same name, Smerdis. Having persuaded this man that he would manage\r\neverything for him, the Magian Patizeithes brought him and seated him\r\nupon the royal throne: and having so done he sent heralds about to\r\nthe various provinces, and among others one to the army in Egypt, to\r\nproclaim to them that they must obey Smerdis the son of Cyrus for the\r\nfuture instead of Cambyses.\r\n\r\n62. So then the other heralds made this proclamation, and also the\r\none who was appointed to go to Egypt, finding Cambyses and his army at\r\nAgbatana in Syria, stood in the midst and began to proclaim that which\r\nhad been commanded to him by the Magian. Hearing this from the herald,\r\nand supposing that the herald was speaking the truth and that he had\r\nhimself been betrayed by Prexaspes, that is to say, that when Prexaspes\r\nwas sent to kill Smerdis he had not done so, Cambyses looked upon\r\nPrexaspes and said: \"Prexaspes, was it thus that thou didst perform for\r\nme the thing which I gave over to thee to do?\" and he said: \"Master, the\r\nsaying is not true that Smerdis thy brother has risen up against thee,\r\nnor that thou wilt have any contention arising from him, either great or\r\nsmall: for I myself, having done that which thou didst command me to do,\r\nburied him with my own hands. If therefore the dead have risen again to\r\nlife, then thou mayest expect that Astyages also the Mede will rise up\r\nagainst thee; but if it is as it was beforetime, there is no fear\r\nnow that any trouble shall spring up for you, at least from him. Now\r\ntherefore I think it well that some should pursue after the herald and\r\nexamine him, asking from whom he has come to proclaim to us that we are\r\nto obey Smerdis as king.\"\r\n\r\n63. When Prexaspes had thus spoken, Cambyses was pleased with the\r\nadvice, and accordingly the herald was pursued forthwith and returned.\r\nThen when he had come back, Prexaspes asked him as follows: \"Man, thou\r\nsayest that thou art come as a messenger from Smerdis the son of Cyrus:\r\nnow therefore speak the truth and go away in peace. I ask thee whether\r\nSmerdis himself appeared before thine eyes and charged thee to say this,\r\nor some one of those who serve him.\" He said: \"Smerdis the son of Cyrus\r\nI have never yet seen, since the day that king Cambyses marched to\r\nEgypt: but the Magian whom Cambyses appointed to be guardian of his\r\nhousehold, he, I say, gave me this charge, saying that Smerdis the son\r\nof Cyrus was he who laid the command upon me to speak these things to\r\nyou.\" Thus he spoke to them, adding no falsehoods to the first, and\r\nCambyses said: \"Prexaspes, thou hast done that which was commanded thee\r\nlike an honest man, and hast escaped censure; but who of the Persians\r\nmay this be who has risen up against me and usurped the name of\r\nSmerdis?\" He said: \"I seem to myself, O king, to have understanding\r\nof this which has come to pass: the Magians have risen against thee,\r\nPatizeithes namely, whom thou didst leave as caretaker of thy household,\r\nand his brother Smerdis.\"\r\n\r\n64. Then Cambyses, when he heard the name of Smerdis, perceived at once\r\nthe true meaning of this report and of the dream, for he thought in his\r\nsleep that some one had reported to him that Smerdis was sitting\r\nupon the royal throne and had touched the heaven with his head: and\r\nperceiving that he had slain his brother without need, he began to\r\nlament for Smerdis; and having lamented for him and sorrowed greatly for\r\nthe whole mishap, he was leaping upon his horse, meaning as quickly as\r\npossible to march his army to Susa against the Magian; and as he leapt\r\nupon his horse, the cap of his sword-sheath fell off, and the sword\r\nbeing left bare struck his thigh. Having been wounded then in the same\r\npart where he had formerly struck Apis the god of the Egyptians, and\r\nbelieving that he had been struck with a mortal blow, Cambyses asked\r\nwhat was the name of that town, and they said \"Agbatana.\" Now even\r\nbefore this he had been informed by the Oracle at the city of Buto that\r\nin Agbatana he should bring his life to an end: and he supposed that he\r\nshould die of old age in Agbatana in Media, where was his chief seat of\r\npower; but the oracle, it appeared, meant in Agbatana of Syria. So when\r\nby questioning now he learnt the name of the town, being struck with\r\nfear both by the calamity caused by the Magian and at the same time by\r\nthe wound, he came to his right mind, and understanding the meaning of\r\nthe oracle he said: \"Here it is fated that Cambyses the son of Cyrus\r\nshall end his life.\"\r\n\r\n65. So much only he said at that time; but about twenty days afterwards\r\nhe sent for the most honourable of the Persians who were with him, and\r\nsaid to them as follows: \"Persians, it has become necessary for me to\r\nmake known to you the thing which I was wont to keep concealed beyond\r\nall other things. Being in Egypt I saw a vision in my sleep, which I\r\nwould I had never seen, and it seemed to me that a messenger came from\r\nhome and reported to me that Smerdis was sitting upon the royal throne\r\nand had touched the heaven with his head. Fearing then lest I should be\r\ndeprived of my power by my brother, I acted quickly rather than wisely;\r\nfor it seems that it is not possible for man 55 to avert that which\r\nis destined to come to pass. I therefore, fool that I was, sent away\r\nPrexaspes to Susa to kill Smerdis; and when this great evil had been\r\ndone, I lived in security, never considering the danger that some other\r\nman might at some time rise up against me, now that Smerdis had been\r\nremoved: and altogether missing the mark of that which was about to\r\nhappen, I have both made myself the murderer of my brother, when there\r\nwas no need, and I have been deprived none the less of the kingdom; for\r\nit was in fact Smerdis the Magian of whom the divine power declared to\r\nme beforehand in the vision that he should rise up against me. So then,\r\nas I say, this deed has been done by me, and ye must imagine that ye\r\nno longer have Smerdis the son of Cyrus alive: but it is in truth the\r\nMagians who are masters of your kingdom, he whom I left as guardian of\r\nmy household and his brother Smerdis. The man then who ought above all\r\nothers to have taken vengeance on my behalf for the dishonour which I\r\nhave suffered from the Magians, has ended his life by an unholy death\r\nreceived from the hands of those who were his nearest of kin; and since\r\nhe is no more, it becomes most needful for me, as the thing next best of\r\nthose which remain, 56 to charge you, O Persians, with that which dying\r\nI desire should be done for me. This then I lay upon you, calling upon\r\nthe gods of the royal house to witness it,—upon you and most of all upon\r\nthose of the Achaemenidai who are present here,—that ye do not permit\r\nthe return of the chief power to the Medes, but that if they have\r\nacquired it by craft, by craft they be deprived of it by you, or if they\r\nhave conquered it by any kind of force, by force and by a strong hand ye\r\nrecover it. And if ye do this, may the earth bring forth her produce\r\nand may your wives and your cattle be fruitful, while ye remain free for\r\never; but if ye do not recover the power nor attempt to recover it, I\r\npray that curses the contrary of these blessings may come upon you, and\r\nmoreover that each man of the Persians may have an end to his life like\r\nthat which has come upon me.\" Then as soon as he had finished speaking\r\nthese things, Cambyses began to bewail and make lamentation for all his\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n66. And the Persians, when they saw that the king had begun to bewail\r\nhimself, both rent the garments which they wore and made lamentation\r\nwithout stint. After this, when the bone had become diseased and the\r\nthigh had mortified, Cambyses the son of Cyrus was carried off by the\r\nwound, having reigned in all seven years and five months, and being\r\nabsolutely childless both of male and female offspring. The Persians\r\nmeanwhile who were present there were very little disposed to believe\r\n57 that the power was in the hands of the Magians: on the contrary, they\r\nwere surely convinced that Cambyses had said that which he said about\r\nthe death of Smerdis to deceive them, in order that all the Persians\r\nmight be moved to war against him. These then were surely convinced that\r\nSmerdis the son of Cyrus was established to be king; for Prexaspes also\r\nvery strongly denied that he had slain Smerdis, since it was not safe,\r\nnow that Cambyses was dead, for him to say that he had destroyed with\r\nhis own hand the son of Cyrus.\r\n\r\n67. Thus when Cambyses had brought his life to an end, the Magian became\r\nking without disturbance, usurping the place of his namesake Smerdis the\r\nson of Cyrus; and he reigned during the seven months which were wanting\r\nyet to Cambyses for the completion of the eight years: and during them\r\nhe performed acts of great benefit to all his subjects, so that after\r\nhis death all those in Asia except the Persians themselves mourned for\r\nhis loss: for the Magian sent messengers abroad to every nation over\r\nwhich he ruled, and proclaimed freedom from military service and from\r\ntribute for three years.\r\n\r\n68. This proclamation, I say, he made at once when he established\r\nhimself upon the throne: but in the eighth month it was discovered\r\nwho he was in the following manner:—There was one Otanes the son of\r\nPharnaspes, in birth and in wealth not inferior to any of the Persians.\r\nThis Otanes was the first who had had suspicion of the Magian, that\r\nhe was not Smerdis the son of Cyrus but the person that he really was,\r\ndrawing his inference from these facts, namely that he never went abroad\r\nout of the fortress, and that he did not summon into his presence any of\r\nthe honourable men among the Persians: and having formed a suspicion\r\nof him, he proceeded to do as follows:—Cambyses had taken to wife his\r\ndaughter, whose name was Phaidyme; 58 and this same daughter the Magian\r\nat that time was keeping as his wife and living with her as with all the\r\nrest also of the wives of Cambyses. Otanes therefore sent a message to\r\nthis daughter and asked her who the man was by whose side she slept,\r\nwhether Smerdis the son of Cyrus or some other. She sent back word to\r\nhim saying that she did not know, for she had never seen Smerdis the\r\nson of Cyrus, nor did she know otherwise who he was who lived with her.\r\nOtanes then sent a second time and said: \"If thou dost not thyself know\r\nSmerdis the son of Cyrus, then do thou ask of Atossa who this man is,\r\nwith whom both she and thou live as wives; for assuredly it must be that\r\nshe knows her own brother.\"\r\n\r\n69. To this the daughter sent back word: \"I am not able either to come\r\nto speech with Atossa or to see any other of the women who live here\r\nwith me; for as soon as this man, whosoever he may be, succeeded to\r\nthe kingdom, he separated us and placed us in different apartments by\r\nourselves.\" When Otanes heard this, the matter became more and more\r\nclear to him, and he sent another message in to her, which said:\r\n\"Daughter, it is right for thee, nobly born as thou art, to undertake\r\nany risk which thy father bids thee take upon thee: for if in truth this\r\nis not Smerdis the son of Cyrus but the man whom I suppose, he ought not\r\nto escape with impunity either for taking thee to his bed or for holding\r\nthe dominion of Persians, but he must pay the penalty. Now therefore do\r\nas I say. When he sleeps by thee and thou perceivest that he is sound\r\nasleep, feel his ears; and if it prove that he has ears, then believe\r\nthat thou art living with Smerdis the son of Cyrus, but if not, believe\r\nthat it is with the Magian Smerdis.\" To this Phaidyme sent an answer\r\nsaying that, if she should do so, she would run a great risk; for\r\nsupposing that he should chance not to have his ears, and she were\r\ndetected feeling for them, she was well assured that he would put her to\r\ndeath; but nevertheless she would do this. So she undertook to do this\r\nfor her father: but as for this Magian Smerdis, he had had his ears\r\ncut off by Cyrus the son of Cambyses when he was king, for some grave\r\noffence. This Phaidyme then, the daughter of Otanes, proceeding to\r\nperform all that she had undertaken for her father, when her turn\r\ncame to go to the Magian (for the wives of the Persians go in to them\r\nregularly each in her turn), came and lay down beside him: and when the\r\nMagian was in deep sleep, she felt his ears; and perceiving not with\r\ndifficulty but easily that her husband had no ears, so soon as it became\r\nday she sent and informed her father of that which had taken place.\r\n\r\n70. Then Otanes took to him Aspathines and Gobryas, 59 who were leading\r\nmen among the Persians and also his own most trusted friends, and\r\nrelated to them the whole matter: and they, as it then appeared, had\r\nsuspicions also themselves that it was so; and when Otanes reported this\r\nto them, they readily accepted his proposals. Then it was resolved\r\nby them that each one should associate with himself that man of the\r\nPersians whom he trusted most; so Otanes brought in Intaphrenes, 60\r\nGobryas brought in Megabyzos, and Aspathines brought in Hydarnes. When\r\nthey had thus become six, Dareios the son of Hystaspes arrived at\r\nSusa, having come from the land of Persia, for of this his father was\r\ngovernor. Accordingly when he came, the six men of the Persians resolved\r\nto associate Dareios also with themselves.\r\n\r\n71. These then having come together, being seven in number, gave pledges\r\nof faith to one another and deliberated together; and when it came to\r\nDareios to declare his opinion, he spoke to them as follows: \"I thought\r\nthat I alone knew this, namely that it was the Magian who was reigning\r\nas king and that Smerdis the son of Cyrus had brought his life to an\r\nend; and for this very reason I am come with earnest purpose to contrive\r\ndeath for the Magian. Since however it has come to pass that ye also\r\nknow and not I alone, I think it well to act at once and not to put the\r\nmatter off, for that is not the better way.\" To this replied Otanes:\r\n\"Son of Hystaspes, thou art the scion of a noble stock, and thou art\r\nshowing thyself, as it seems, in no way inferior to thy father: do not\r\nhowever hasten this enterprise so much without consideration, but take\r\nit up more prudently; for we must first become more in numbers, and then\r\nundertake the matter.\" In answer to this Dareios said: \"Men who are here\r\npresent, if ye shall follow the way suggested by Otanes, know that\r\nye will perish miserably; for some one will carry word to the Magian,\r\ngetting gain thereby privately for himself. Your best way would have\r\nbeen to do this action upon your own risk alone; but since it seemed\r\ngood to you to refer the matter to a greater number, and ye communicated\r\nit to me, either let us do the deed to-day, or be ye assured that if\r\nthis present day shall pass by, none other shall prevent me 61 as your\r\naccuser, but I will myself tell these things to the Magian.\"\r\n\r\n72. To this Otanes, when he saw Dareios in violent haste, replied:\r\n\"Since thou dost compel us to hasten the matter and dost not permit us\r\nto delay, come expound to us thyself in what manner we shall pass into\r\nthe palace and lay hands upon them: for that there are guards set in\r\nvarious parts, thou knowest probably thyself as well as we, if not from\r\nsight at least from hearsay; and in what manner shall we pass through\r\nthese?\" Dareios made reply with these words: \"Otanes, there are many\r\nthings in sooth which it is not possible to set forth in speech, but\r\nonly in deed; and other things there are which in speech can be set\r\nforth, but from them comes no famous deed. Know ye however that the\r\nguards which are set are not difficult to pass: for in the first place,\r\nwe being what we are, there is no one who will not let us go by, partly,\r\nas may be supposed, from having respect for us, and partly also perhaps\r\nfrom fear; and secondly I have myself a most specious pretext by means\r\nof which we may pass by; for I shall say that I am just now come from\r\nthe Persian land and desire to declare to the king a certain message\r\nfrom my father: for where it is necessary that a lie be spoken, let it\r\nbe spoken; seeing that we all aim at the same object, both they who lie\r\nand they who always speak the truth; those lie whenever they are likely\r\nto gain anything by persuading with their lies, and these tell the truth\r\nin order that they may draw to themselves gain by the truth, and that\r\nthings 62 may be entrusted to them more readily. Thus, while practising\r\ndifferent ways, we aim all at the same thing. If however they were not\r\nlikely to make any gain by it, the truth-teller would lie and the\r\nliar would speak the truth, with indifference. Whosoever then of the\r\ndoor-keepers shall let us pass by of his own free will, for him it shall\r\nbe the better afterwards; but whosoever shall endeavour to oppose our\r\npassage, let him then and there be marked as our enemy, 63 and after\r\nthat let us push in and set about our work.\"\r\n\r\n73. Then said Gobryas: \"Friends, at what time will there be a fairer\r\nopportunity for us either to recover our rule, or, if we are not able to\r\nget it again, to die? seeing that we being Persians on the one hand lie\r\nunder the rule of a Mede, a Magian, and that too a man whose ears\r\nhave been cut off. Moreover all those of you who stood by the side\r\nof Cambyses when he was sick remember assuredly what he laid upon the\r\nPersians as he was bringing his life to an end, if they should not\r\nattempt to win back the power; and this we did not accept then, but\r\nsupposed that Cambyses had spoken in order to deceive us. Now therefore\r\nI give my vote that we follow the opinion of Dareios, and that we do not\r\ndepart from this assembly to go anywhither else but straight to attack\r\nthe Magian.\" Thus spoke Gobryas, and they all approved of this proposal.\r\n\r\n74. Now while these were thus taking counsel together, it was coming to\r\npass by coincidence as follows:—The Magians taking counsel together had\r\nresolved to join Prexaspes with themselves as a friend, both because\r\nhe had suffered grievous wrong from Cambyses, who had killed his son by\r\nshooting him, and because he alone knew for a certainty of the death\r\nof Smerdis the son of Cyrus, having killed him with his own hands, and\r\nfinally because Prexaspes was in very great repute among the Persians.\r\nFor these reasons they summoned him and endeavoured to win him to be\r\ntheir friend, engaging him by pledge and with oaths, that he would\r\nassuredly keep to himself and not reveal to any man the deception which\r\nhad been practised by them upon the Persians, and promising to give\r\nhim things innumerable 64 in return. After Prexaspes had promised to do\r\nthis, the Magians, having persuaded him so far, proposed to him a second\r\nthing, and said that they would call together all the Persians to\r\ncome up to the wall of the palace, and bade him go up upon a tower and\r\naddress them, saying that they were living under the rule of Smerdis the\r\nson of Cyrus and no other. This they so enjoined because they supposed\r\n65 that he had the greatest credit among the Persians, and because he\r\nhad frequently declared the opinion that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was\r\nstill alive, and had denied that he had slain him.\r\n\r\n75. When Prexaspes said that he was ready to do this also, the Magians\r\nhaving called together the Persians caused him to go up upon a tower and\r\nbade him address them. Then he chose to forget those things which they\r\nasked of him, and beginning with Achaimenes he traced the descent of\r\nCyrus on the father's side, and then, when he came down to Cyrus, he\r\nrelated at last what great benefits he had conferred upon the Persians;\r\nand having gone through this recital he proceeded to declare the truth,\r\nsaying that formerly he kept it secret, since it was not safe for him\r\nto tell of that which had been done, but at the present time he was\r\ncompelled to make it known. He proceeded to say how he had himself slain\r\nSmerdis the son of Cyrus, being compelled by Cambyses, and that it was\r\nthe Magians who were now ruling. Then he made imprecation of many evils\r\non the Persians, if they did not win back again the power and take\r\nvengeance upon the Magians, and upon that he let himself fall down from\r\nthe tower head foremost. Thus Prexaspes ended his life, having been\r\nthroughout his time a man of repute.\r\n\r\n76. Now the seven of the Persians, when they had resolved forthwith to\r\nlay hands upon the Magians and not to delay, made prayer to the gods\r\nand went, knowing nothing of that which had been done with regard\r\nto Prexaspes: and as they were going and were in the middle of their\r\ncourse, they heard that which had happened about Prexaspes. Upon that\r\nthey retired out of the way and again considered with themselves, Otanes\r\nand his supporters strongly urging that they should delay and not set to\r\nthe work when things were thus disturbed, 66 while Dareios and those of\r\nhis party urged that they should go forthwith and do that which had been\r\nresolved, and not delay. Then while they were contending, there appeared\r\nseven pairs of hawks pursuing two pairs of vultures, plucking out\r\ntheir feathers and tearing them. Seeing this the seven all approved\r\nthe opinion of Dareios and thereupon they went to the king's palace,\r\nencouraged by the sight of the birds.\r\n\r\n77. When they appeared at the gates, it happened nearly as Dareios\r\nsupposed, for the guards, having respect for men who were chief among\r\nthe Persians, and not suspecting that anything would be done by them of\r\nthe kind proposed, allowed them to pass in under the guiding of heaven,\r\nand none asked them any question. Then when they had passed into the\r\ncourt, they met the eunuchs who bore in the messages to the king; and\r\nthese inquired of them for what purpose they had come, and at the same\r\ntime they threatened with punishment the keepers of the gates for having\r\nlet them pass in, and tried to stop the seven when they attempted to\r\ngo forward. Then they gave the word to one another and drawing their\r\ndaggers stabbed these men there upon the spot, who tried to stop them,\r\nand themselves went running on towards the chamber of the men. 6601\r\n\r\n78. Now the Magians happened both of them to be there within, consulting\r\nabout that which had been done by Prexaspes. So when they saw that the\r\neunuchs had been attacked and were crying aloud, they ran back 67\r\nboth of them, and perceiving that which was being done they turned to\r\nself-defence: and one of them got down his bow and arrows before he was\r\nattacked, while the other had recourse to his spear. Then they engaged\r\nin combat with one another; and that one of them who had taken up his\r\nbow and arrows found them of no use, since his enemies were close at\r\nhand and pressed hard upon him, but the other defended himself with his\r\nspear, and first he struck Aspathines in the thigh, and then Intaphrenes\r\nin the eye; and Intaphrenes lost his eye by reason of the wound, but his\r\nlife he did not lose. These then were wounded by one of the Magians, but\r\nthe other, when his bow and arrows proved useless to him, fled into a\r\nbedchamber which opened into the chamber of the men, intending to close\r\nthe door; and with him there rushed in two of the seven, Dareios and\r\nGobryas. And when Gobryas was locked together in combat with the Magian,\r\nDareios stood by and was at a loss what to do, because it was dark, and\r\nhe was afraid lest he should strike Gobryas. Then seeing him standing by\r\nidle, Gobryas asked why he did not use his hands, and he said: \"Because\r\nI am afraid lest I may strike thee\": and Gobryas answered: \"Thrust\r\nwith thy sword even though it stab through us both.\" So Dareios was\r\npersuaded, and he thrust with his danger and happened to hit the Magian.\r\n\r\n79. So when they had slain the Magians and cut off their heads, they\r\nleft behind those of their number who were wounded, both because they\r\nwere unable to go, and also in order that they might take charge of the\r\nfortress, and the five others taking with them the heads of the Magians\r\nran with shouting and clashing of arms and called upon the other\r\nPersians to join them, telling them of that which had been done and\r\nshowing the heads, and at the same time they proceeded to slay every one\r\nof the Magians who crossed their path. So the Persians when they heard\r\nof that which had been brought to pass by the seven and of the deceit\r\nof the Magians, thought good themselves also to do the same, and drawing\r\ntheir daggers they killed the Magians wherever they found one; so that\r\nif night had not come on and stopped them, they would not have left a\r\nsingle Magian alive. This day the Persians celebrate in common more than\r\nall other days, and upon it they keep a great festival which is called\r\nby the Persians the festival of the slaughter of the Magians, 6701 on\r\nwhich no Magian is permitted to appear abroad, but the Magians keep\r\nthemselves within their houses throughout that day.\r\n\r\n80. When the tumult had subsided and more than five days had elapsed, 68\r\nthose who had risen against the Magians began to take counsel about the\r\ngeneral state, and there were spoken speeches which some of the Hellenes\r\ndo not believe were really uttered, but spoken they were nevertheless.\r\n69 On the one hand Otanes urged that they should resign the government\r\ninto the hands of the whole body of the Persians, and his words were as\r\nfollows: \"To me it seems best that no single one of us should henceforth\r\nbe ruler, for that is neither pleasant nor profitable. Ye saw the\r\ninsolent temper of Cambyses, to what lengths it went, and ye have had\r\nexperience also of the insolence of the Magian: and how should the rule\r\nof one alone be a well-ordered thing, seeing that the monarch may do\r\nwhat he desires without rendering any account of his acts? Even the best\r\nof all men, if he were placed in this disposition, would be caused by\r\nit to change from his wonted disposition: for insolence is engendered in\r\nhim by the good things which he possesses, and envy is implanted in man\r\nfrom the beginning; and having these two things, he has all vice: for he\r\ndoes many deeds of reckless wrong, partly moved by insolence proceeding\r\nfrom satiety, and partly by envy. And yet a despot at least ought to\r\nhave been free from envy, seeing that he has all manner of good\r\nthings. He is however naturally in just the opposite temper towards\r\nhis subjects; for he grudges to the nobles that they should survive and\r\nlive, but delights in the basest of citizens, and he is more ready than\r\nany other man to receive calumnies. Then of all things he is the most\r\ninconsistent; for if you express admiration of him moderately, he is\r\noffended that no very great court is paid to him, whereas if you\r\npay court to him extravagantly, he is offended with you for being a\r\nflatterer. And the most important matter of all is that which I am about\r\nto say:—he disturbs the customs handed down from our fathers, he is a\r\nravisher of women, and he puts men to death without trial. On the other\r\nhand the rule of many has first a name attaching to it which is the\r\nfairest of all names, that is to say 'Equality'; 70 next, the multitude\r\ndoes none of those things which the monarch does: offices of state are\r\nexercised by lot, and the magistrates are compelled to render account\r\nof their action: and finally all matters of deliberation are referred to\r\nthe public assembly. I therefore give as my opinion that we let monarchy\r\ngo and increase the power of the multitude; for in the many is contained\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\n81. This was the opinion expressed by Otanes; but Megabyzos urged that\r\nthey should entrust matters to the rule of a few, saying these words:\r\n\"That which Otanes said in opposition to a tyranny, let it be counted as\r\nsaid for me also, but in that which he said urging that we should make\r\nover the power to the multitude, he has missed the best counsel: for\r\nnothing is more senseless or insolent than a worthless crowd; and\r\nfor men flying from the insolence of a despot to fall into that of\r\nunrestrained popular power, is by no means to be endured: for he, if he\r\ndoes anything, does it knowing what he does, but the people cannot even\r\nknow; for how can that know which has neither been taught anything noble\r\nby others nor perceived anything of itself, 71 but pushes on matters\r\nwith violent impulse and without understanding, like a torrent stream?\r\nRule of the people then let them adopt who are foes to the Persians; but\r\nlet us choose a company of the best men, and to them attach the chief\r\npower; for in the number of these we shall ourselves also be, and it is\r\nlikely that the resolutions taken by the best men will be the best.\"\r\n\r\n82. This was the opinion expressed by Megabyzos; and thirdly Dareios\r\nproceeded to declare his opinion, saying: \"To me it seems that in\r\nthose things which Megabyzos said with regard to the multitude he spoke\r\nrightly, but in those which he said with regard to the rule of a few,\r\nnot rightly: for whereas there are three things set before us, and each\r\nis supposed 72 to be the best in its own kind, that is to say a good\r\npopular government, and the rule of a few, and thirdly the rule of\r\none, I say that this last is by far superior to the others; for nothing\r\nbetter can be found than the rule of an individual man of the best\r\nkind; seeing that using the best judgment he would be guardian of the\r\nmultitude without reproach; and resolutions directed against enemies\r\nwould so best be kept secret. In an oligarchy however it happens often\r\nthat many, while practising virtue with regard to the commonwealth,\r\nhave strong private enmities arising among themselves; for as each man\r\ndesires to be himself the leader and to prevail in counsels, they come\r\nto great enmities with one another, whence arise factions among them,\r\nand out of the factions comes murder, and from murder results the rule\r\nof one man; and thus it is shown in this instance by how much that is\r\nthe best. Again, when the people rules, it is impossible that corruption\r\n73 should not arise, and when corruption arises in the commonwealth,\r\nthere arise among the corrupt men not enmities but strong ties of\r\nfriendship: for they who are acting corruptly to the injury of the\r\ncommonwealth put their heads together secretly to do so. And this\r\ncontinues so until at last some one takes the leadership of the people\r\nand stops the course of such men. By reason of this the man of whom I\r\nspeak is admired by the people, and being so admired he suddenly appears\r\nas monarch. Thus he too furnishes herein an example to prove that the\r\nrule of one is the best thing. Finally, to sum up all in a single word,\r\nwhence arose the liberty which we possess, and who gave it to us? Was it\r\na gift of the people or of an oligarchy or of a monarch? I therefore\r\nam of opinion that we, having been set free by one man, should preserve\r\nthat form of rule, and in other respects also that we should not annul\r\nthe customs of our fathers which are ordered well; for that is not the\r\nbetter way.\"\r\n\r\n83. These three opinions then had been proposed, and the other four\r\nmen of the seven gave their assent to the last. So when Otanes, who was\r\ndesirous to give equality to the Persians, found his opinion defeated,\r\nhe spoke to those assembled thus: \"Partisans, it is clear that some\r\none of us must become king, selected either by casting lots, or by\r\nentrusting the decision to the multitude of the Persians and taking him\r\nwhom it shall choose, or by some other means. I therefore shall not be a\r\ncompetitor with you, for I do not desire either to rule or to be ruled;\r\nand on this condition I withdraw from my claim to rule, namely that I\r\nshall not be ruled by any of you, either I myself or my descendants in\r\nfuture time.\" When he had said this, the six made agreement with him on\r\nthose terms, and he was no longer a competitor with them, but withdrew\r\nfrom the assembly; and at the present time this house remains free alone\r\nof all the Persian houses, and submits to rule only so far as it wills\r\nto do so itself, not transgressing the laws of the Persians.\r\n\r\n84. The rest however of the seven continued to deliberate how they\r\nshould establish a king in the most just manner; and it was resolved by\r\nthem that to Otanes and his descendants in succession, if the kingdom\r\nshould come to any other of the seven, there should be given as special\r\ngifts a Median dress every year and all those presents which are\r\nesteemed among the Persians to be the most valuable: and the reason why\r\nthey determined that these things should be given to him, was because\r\nhe first suggested to them the matter and combined them together. These\r\nwere special gifts for Otanes; and this they also determined for all in\r\ncommon, namely that any one of the seven who wished might pass in to the\r\nroyal palaces without any to bear in a message, unless the king happened\r\nto be sleeping with his wife; and that it should not be lawful for the\r\nking to marry from any other family, but only from those of the men who\r\nhad made insurrection with him: and about the kingdom they determined\r\nthis, namely that the man whose horse should first neigh at sunrise\r\nin the suburb of the city when they were mounted upon their horses, he\r\nshould have the kingdom.\r\n\r\n85. Now Dareios had a clever horse-keeper, whose name was Oibares. To\r\nthis man, when they had left their assembly, Dareios spoke these words:\r\n\"Oibares, we have resolved to do about the kingdom thus, namely that the\r\nman whose horse first neighs at sunrise, when we are mounted upon our\r\nhorses he shall be king. Now therefore, if thou hast any cleverness,\r\ncontrive that we may obtain this prize, and not any other man.\" Oibares\r\nreplied thus: \"If, my master, it depends in truth upon this whether thou\r\nbe king or no, have confidence so far as concerns this and keep a good\r\nheart, for none other shall be king before thee; such charms have I at\r\nmy command.\" Then Dareios said: \"If then thou hast any such trick, it\r\nis time to devise it and not to put things off, for our trial is\r\nto-morrow.\" Oibares therefore hearing this did as follows:—when night\r\nwas coming on he took one of the mares, namely that one which the horse\r\nof Dareios preferred, and this he led into the suburb of the city and\r\ntied her up: then he brought to her the horse of Dareios, and having for\r\nsome time led him round her, making him go so close by so as to touch\r\nthe mare, at last he let the horse mount.\r\n\r\n86. Now at dawn of day the six came to the place as they had agreed,\r\nriding upon their horses; and as they rode through by the suburb of the\r\ncity, when they came near the place where the mare had been tied up on\r\nthe former night, the horse of Dareios ran up to the place and neighed;\r\nand just when the horse had done this, there came lightning and\r\nthunder from a clear sky: and the happening of these things to Dareios\r\nconsummated his claim, for they seemed to have come to pass by some\r\ndesign, and the others leapt down from their horses and did obeisance to\r\nDareios.\r\n\r\n87. Some say that the contrivance of Oibares was this, but others say\r\nas follows (for the story is told by the Persians in both ways), namely\r\nthat he touched with his hands the parts of this mare and kept his hand\r\nhidden in his trousers; and when at sunrise they were about to let\r\nthe horses go, this Oibares pulled out his hand and applied it to the\r\nnostrils of the horse of Dareios; and the horse, perceiving the smell,\r\nsnorted and neighed.\r\n\r\n88. So Dareios the son of Hystaspes had been declared king; and in Asia\r\nall except the Arabians were his subjects, having been subdued by\r\nCyrus and again afterwards by Cambyses. The Arabians however were never\r\nobedient to the Persians under conditions of subjection, but had become\r\nguest-friends when they let Cambyses pass by to Egypt: for against the\r\nwill of the Arabians the Persians would not be able to invade Egypt.\r\nMoreover Dareios made the most noble marriages possible in the\r\nestimation of the Persians; for he married two daughters of Cyrus,\r\nAtossa and Artystone, of whom the one, Arossa, had before been the\r\nwife of Cambyses her brother and then afterwards of the Magian, while\r\nArtystone was a virgin; and besides them he married the daughter of\r\nSmerdis the son of Cyrus, whose name was Parmys; and he also took to\r\nwife the daughter of Otanes, he who had discovered the Magian; and all\r\nthings became filled with his power. And first he caused to be a carving\r\nin stone, and set it up; and in it there was the figure of a man on\r\nhorseback, and he wrote upon it writing to this effect: \"Dareios son of\r\nHystaspes by the excellence of his horse,\" mentioning the name of it,\r\n\"and of his horse-keeper Oibares obtained the kingdom of the Persians.\"\r\n\r\n89. Having so done in Persia, he established twenty provinces, which the\r\nPersians themselves call satrapies; and having established the provinces\r\nand set over them rulers, he appointed tribute to come to him from them\r\naccording to races, joining also to the chief races those who dwelt on\r\ntheir borders, or passing beyond the immediate neighbours and assigning\r\nto various races those which lay more distant. He divided the provinces\r\nand the yearly payment of tribute as follows: and those of them\r\nwho brought in silver were commanded to pay by the standard of the\r\nBabylonian talent, but those who brought in gold by the Euboïc talent;\r\nnow the Babylonian talent is equal to eight-and-seventy Euboïc pounds.\r\n74 For in the reign of Cyrus, and again of Cambyses, nothing was fixed\r\nabout tribute, but they used to bring gifts: and on account of this\r\nappointing of tribute and other things like this, the Persians say that\r\nDareios was a shopkeeper, Cambyses a master, and Cyrus a father; the\r\none because he dealt with all his affairs like a shopkeeper, the second\r\nbecause he was harsh and had little regard for any one, and the other\r\nbecause he was gentle and contrived for them all things good.\r\n\r\n90. From the Ionians and the Magnesians who dwell in Asia and the\r\nAiolians, Carians, Lykians, Milyans and Pamphylians (for one single\r\nsum was appointed by him as tribute for all these) there came in four\r\nhundred talents of silver. This was appointed by him to be the first\r\ndivision. 75 From the Mysians and Lydians and Lasonians and Cabalians\r\nand Hytennians 76 there came in five hundred talents: this is the second\r\ndivision. From the Hellespontians who dwell on the right as one sails\r\nin and the Phrygians and the Thracians who dwell in Asia and the\r\nPaphlagonians and Mariandynoi and Syrians 77 the tribute was three\r\nhundred and sixty talents: this is the third division. From the\r\nKilikians, besides three hundred and sixty white horses, one for every\r\nday in the year, there came also five hundred talents of silver; of\r\nthese one hundred and forty talents were spent upon the horsemen which\r\nserved as a guard to the Kilikian land, and the remaining three hundred\r\nand sixty came in year by year to Dareios: this is the fourth division.\r\n\r\n91. From that division which begins with the city of Posideion, founded\r\nby Amphilochos the son of Amphiaraos on the borders of the Kilikians and\r\nthe Syrians, and extends as far as Egypt, not including the territory\r\nof the Arabians (for this was free from payment), the amount was\r\nthree hundred and fifty talents; and in this division are the whole of\r\nPhenicia and Syria which is called Palestine and Cyprus: this is the\r\nfifth division. From Egypt and the Libyans bordering upon Egypt, and\r\nfrom Kyrene and Barca, for these were so ordered as to belong to\r\nthe Egyptian division, there came in seven hundred talents, without\r\nreckoning the money produced by the lake of Moiris, that is to say from\r\nthe fish; 7701 without reckoning this, I say, or the corn which was\r\ncontributed in addition by measure, there came in seven hundred talents;\r\nfor as regards the corn, they contribute by measure one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand 78 bushels for the use of those Persians who are\r\nestablished in the \"White Fortress\" at Memphis, and for their foreign\r\nmercenaries: this is the sixth division. The Sattagydai and Gandarians\r\nand Dadicans and Aparytai, being joined together, brought in one hundred\r\nand seventy talents: this is the seventh division. From Susa and the\r\nrest of the land of the Kissians there came in three hundred: this is\r\nthe eighth division.\r\n\r\n92. From Babylon and from the rest of Assyria there came in to him a\r\nthousand talents of silver and five hundred boys for eunuchs: this is\r\nthe ninth division. From Agbatana and from the rest of Media and the\r\nParicanians and Orthocorybantians, four hundred and fifty talents: this\r\nis the tenth division. The Caspians and Pausicans 79 and Pantimathoi and\r\nDareitai, contributing together, brought in two hundred talents: this\r\nis the eleventh division. From the Bactrians as far as the Aigloi\r\nthe tribute was three hundred and sixty talents: this is the twelfth\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n93. From Pactyïke and the Armenians and the people bordering upon them\r\nas far as the Euxine, four hundred talents: this is the thirteenth\r\ndivision. From the Sagartians and Sarangians and Thamanaians and Utians\r\nand Mycans and those who dwell in the islands of the Erythraian Sea,\r\nwhere the king settles those who are called the \"Removed,\" 80 from all\r\nthese together a tribute was produced of six hundred talents: this is\r\nthe fourteenth division. The Sacans and the Caspians 81 brought in two\r\nhundred and fifty talents: this is the fifteenth division. The Parthians\r\nand Chorasmians and Sogdians and Areians three hundred talents: this is\r\nthe sixteenth division.\r\n\r\n94. The Paricanians and Ethiopians in Asia brought in four hundred\r\ntalents: this is the seventeenth division. To the Matienians and\r\nSaspeirians and Alarodians was appointed a tribute of two hundred\r\ntalents: this is the eighteenth division. To the Moschoi and Tibarenians\r\nand Macronians and Mossynoicoi and Mares three hundred talents were\r\nordered: this is the nineteenth division. Of the Indians the number is\r\nfar greater than that of any other race of men of whom we know; and\r\nthey brought in a tribute larger than all the rest, that is to say three\r\nhundred and sixty talents of gold-dust: this is the twentieth division.\r\n\r\n95. Now if we compare Babylonian with Euboïc talents, the silver is\r\nfound to amount to nine thousand eight hundred and eighty 82 talents;\r\nand if we reckon the gold at thirteen times the value of silver, weight\r\nfor weight, the gold-dust is found to amount to four thousand six\r\nhundred and eighty Euboïc talents. These being all added together,\r\nthe total which was collected as yearly tribute for Dareios amounts to\r\nfourteen thousand five hundred and sixty Euboïc talents: the sums which\r\nare less than these 83 I pass over and do not mention.\r\n\r\n96. This was the tribute which came in to Dareios from Asia and from\r\na small part of Libya: but as time went on, other tribute came in also\r\nfrom the islands and from those who dwell in Europe as far as Thessaly.\r\nThis tribute the king stores up in his treasury in the following\r\nmanner:—he melts it down and pours it into jars of earthenware, and when\r\nhe has filled the jars he takes off the earthenware jar from the\r\nmetal; and when he wants money he cuts off so much as he needs on each\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n97. These were the provinces and the assessments of tribute: and\r\nthe Persian land alone has not been mentioned by me as paying a\r\ncontribution, for the Persians have their land to dwell in free from\r\npayment. The following moreover had no tribute fixed for them to pay,\r\nbut brought gifts, namely the Ethiopians who border upon Egypt, whom\r\nCambyses subdued as he marched against the Long-lived Ethiopians, those\r\n84 who dwell about Nysa, which is called \"sacred,\" and who celebrate the\r\nfestivals in honour of Dionysos: these Ethiopians and those who dwell\r\nnear them have the same kind of seed as the Callantian Indians, and they\r\nhave underground dwellings. 85 These both together brought every other\r\nyear, and continue to bring even to my own time, two quart measures 86\r\nof unmelted gold and two hundred blocks of ebony and five Ethiopian boys\r\nand twenty large elephant tusks. The Colchians also had set themselves\r\namong those who brought gifts, and with them those who border upon them\r\nextending as far as the range of the Caucasus (for the Persian rule\r\nextends as far as these mountains, but those who dwell in the\r\nparts beyond Caucasus toward the North Wind regard the Persians no\r\nlonger),—these, I say, continued to bring the gifts which they had fixed\r\nfor themselves every four years 87 even down to my own time, that is to\r\nsay, a hundred boys and a hundred maidens. Finally, the Arabians brought\r\na thousand talents of frankincense every year. Such were the gifts which\r\nthese brought to the king apart from the tribute.\r\n\r\n98. Now this great quantity of gold, out of which the Indians bring in\r\nto the king the gold-dust which has been mentioned, is obtained by them\r\nin a manner which I shall tell:—That part of the Indian land which is\r\ntowards the rising sun is sand; for of all the peoples in Asia of which\r\nwe know or about which any certain report is given, the Indians dwell\r\nfurthest away towards the East and the sunrising; seeing that the\r\ncountry to the East of the Indians is desert on account of the sand. Now\r\nthere are many tribes of Indians, and they do not agree with one another\r\nin language; and some of them are pastoral and others not so, and some\r\ndwell in the swamps of the river 88 and feed upon raw fish, which they\r\ncatch by fishing from boats made of cane; and each boat is made of one\r\njoint of cane. These Indians of which I speak wear clothing made of\r\nrushes: they gather and cut the rushes from the river and then weave\r\nthem together into a kind of mat and put it on like a corslet.\r\n\r\n99. Others of the Indians, dwelling to the East of these, are pastoral\r\nand eat raw flesh: these are called Padaians, and they practise the\r\nfollowing customs:—whenever any of their tribe falls ill, whether it be\r\na woman or a man, if a man then the men who are his nearest associates\r\nput him to death, saying that he is wasting away with the disease and\r\nhis flesh is being spoilt for them: 89 and meanwhile he denies stoutly\r\nand says that he is not ill, but they do not agree with him; and after\r\nthey have killed him they feast upon his flesh: but if it be a woman\r\nwho falls ill, the women who are her greatest intimates do to her in the\r\nsame manner as the men do in the other case. For 90 in fact even if a\r\nman has come to old age they slay him and feast upon him; but very few\r\nof them come to be reckoned as old, for they kill every one who falls\r\ninto sickness, before he reaches old age.\r\n\r\n100. Other Indians have on the contrary a manner of life as\r\nfollows:—they neither kill any living thing nor do they sow any crops\r\nnor is it their custom to possess houses; but they feed on herbs, and\r\nthey have a grain of the size of millet, in a sheath, which grows of\r\nitself from the ground; this they gather and boil with the sheath, and\r\nmake it their food: and whenever any of them falls into sickness, he\r\ngoes to the desert country and lies there, and none of them pay any\r\nattention either to one who is dead or to one who is sick.\r\n\r\n101. The sexual intercourse of all these Indians of whom I have spoken\r\nis open like that of cattle, and they have all one colour of skin,\r\nresembling that of the Ethiopians: moreover the seed which they emit is\r\nnot white like that of other races, but black like their skin; and the\r\nEthiopians also are similar in this respect. These tribes of Indians\r\ndwell further off than the Persian power extends, and towards the South\r\nWind, and they never became subjects of Dareios.\r\n\r\n102. Others however of the Indians are on the borders of the city of\r\nCaspatyros and the country of Pactyïke, dwelling towards the North 91 of\r\nthe other Indians; and they have a manner of living nearly the same as\r\nthat of the Bactrians: these are the most warlike of the Indians, and\r\nthese are they who make expeditions for the gold. For in the parts where\r\nthey live it is desert on account of the sand; and in this desert and\r\nsandy tract are produced ants, which are in size smaller than dogs but\r\nlarger than foxes, for 92 there are some of them kept at the residence\r\nof the king of Persia, which are caught here. These ants then make their\r\ndwelling under ground and carry up the sand just in the same manner as\r\nthe ants found in the land of the Hellenes, which they themselves\r\n93 also very much resemble in form; and the sand which is brought up\r\ncontains gold. To obtain this sand the Indians make expeditions into the\r\ndesert, each one having yoked together three camels, placing a female in\r\nthe middle and a male like a trace-horse to draw by each side. On this\r\nfemale he mounts himself, having arranged carefully that she shall be\r\ntaken to be yoked from young ones, the more lately born the better. For\r\ntheir female camels are not inferior to horses in speed, and moreover\r\nthey are much more capable of bearing weights.\r\n\r\n103. As to the form of the camel, I do not here describe it, since the\r\nHellenes for whom I write are already acquainted with it, but I shall\r\ntell that which is not commonly known about it, which is this:—the camel\r\nhas in the hind legs four thighs and four knees, 94 and its organs of\r\ngeneration are between the hind legs, turned towards the tail.\r\n\r\n104. The Indians, I say, ride out to get the gold in the manner and with\r\nthe kind of yoking which I have described, making calculations so that\r\nthey may be engaged in carrying it off at the time when the greatest\r\nheat prevails; for the heat causes the ants to disappear underground.\r\nNow among these nations the sun is hottest in the morning hours, not\r\nat midday as with others, but from sunrise to the time of closing the\r\nmarket: and during this time it produces much greater heat than at\r\nmidday in Hellas, so that it is said that then they drench themselves\r\nwith water. Midday however has about equal degree of heat with the\r\nIndians as with other men, while after midday their sun becomes like the\r\nmorning sun with other men, and after this, as it goes further away, it\r\nproduces still greater coolness, until at last at sunset it makes the\r\nair very cool indeed.\r\n\r\n105. When the Indians have come to the place with bags, they fill them\r\nwith the sand and ride away back as quickly as they can, for forthwith\r\nthe ants, perceiving, as the Persians allege, by the smell, begin to\r\npursue them: and this animal, they say, is superior to every other\r\ncreature in swiftness, so that unless the Indians got a start in their\r\ncourse, while the ants were gathering together, not one of them would\r\nescape. So then the male camels, for they are inferior in speed of\r\nrunning to the females, if they drag behind are even let loose 95 from\r\nthe side of the female, one after the other; 96 the females however,\r\nremembering the young which they left behind, do not show any slackness\r\nin their course. 97 Thus it is that the Indians get most part of the\r\ngold, as the Persians say; there is however other gold also in their\r\nland obtained by digging, but in smaller quantities.\r\n\r\n106. It seems indeed that the extremities of the inhabited world had\r\nallotted to them by nature the fairest things, just as it was the lot\r\nof Hellas to have its seasons far more fairly tempered than other lands:\r\nfor first, India is the most distant of inhabited lands towards the\r\nEast, as I have said a little above, and in this land not only the\r\nanimals, birds as well as four-footed beasts, are much larger than in\r\nother places (except the horses, which are surpassed by those of Media\r\ncalled Nessaian), but also there is gold in abundance there, some got\r\nby digging, some brought down by rivers, and some carried off as I\r\nexplained just now: and there also the trees which grow wild produce\r\nwool which surpasses in beauty and excellence that from sheep, and the\r\nIndians wear clothing obtained from these trees.\r\n\r\n107. Then again Arabia is the furthest of inhabited lands in the\r\ndirection of the midday, and in it alone of all lands grow frankincense\r\nand myrrh and cassia and cinnamon and gum-mastich. All these except\r\nmyrrh are got with difficulty by the Arabians. Frankincense they collect\r\nby burning the storax, which is brought thence to the Hellenes by the\r\nPhenicians, by burning this, I say, so as to produce smoke they take\r\nit; for these trees which produce frankincense are guarded by winged\r\nserpents, small in size and of various colours, which watch in great\r\nnumbers about each tree, of the same kind as those which attempt to\r\ninvade Egypt: 9701 and they cannot be driven away from the trees by any\r\nother thing but only the smoke of storax.\r\n\r\n108. The Arabians say also that all the world would have been by this\r\ntime filled with these serpents, if that did not happen with regard to\r\nthem which I knew happened with regard to vipers: and it seems that the\r\nDivine Providence, as indeed was to be expected, seeing that it is wise,\r\nhas made all those animals prolific which are of cowardly spirit and\r\ngood for food, in order that they may not be all eaten up and their race\r\nfail, whereas it has made those which are bold and noxious to have small\r\nprogeny. For example, because the hare is hunted by every beast and bird\r\nas well as by man, therefore it is so very prolific as it is: and this\r\nis the only one of all beasts which becomes pregnant again before the\r\nformer young are born, and has in its womb some of its young covered\r\nwith fur and others bare; and while one is just being shaped in the\r\nmatrix, another is being conceived. Thus it is in this case; whereas\r\nthe lioness, which is the strongest and most courageous of creatures,\r\nproduces one cub once only in her life; for when she produces young\r\nshe casts out her womb together with her young; and the cause of it is\r\nthis:—when the cub being within the mother 98 begins to move about, then\r\nhaving claws by far sharper than those of any other beast he tears the\r\nwomb, and as he grows larger he proceeds much further in his scratching:\r\nat last the time of birth approaches and there is now nothing at all\r\nleft of it in a sound condition.\r\n\r\n109. Just so also, if vipers and the winged serpents of the Arabians\r\nwere produced in the ordinary course of their nature, man would not be\r\nable to live upon the earth; but as it is, when they couple with one\r\nanother and the male is in the act of generation, as he lets go from\r\nhim the seed, the female seizes hold of his neck, and fastening on to\r\nit does not relax her hold till she has eaten it through. The male then\r\ndies in the manner which I have said, but the female pays the penalty of\r\nretribution for the male in this manner:—the young while they are still\r\nin the womb take vengeance for their father by eating through their\r\nmother, 99 and having eaten through her belly they thus make their way\r\nout for themselves. Other serpents however, which are not hurtful to\r\nman, produce eggs and hatch from them a very large number of offspring.\r\nNow vipers are distributed over all the earth; but the others, which are\r\nwinged, are found in great numbers together in Arabia and in no other\r\nland: therefore it is that they appear to be numerous.\r\n\r\n110. This frankincense then is obtained thus by the Arabians; and cassia\r\nis obtained as follows:—they bind up in cows'-hide and other kinds of\r\nskins all their body and their face except only the eyes, and then go to\r\nget the cassia. This grows in a pool not very deep, and round the pool\r\nand in it lodge, it seems, winged beasts nearly resembling bats, and\r\nthey squeak horribly and are courageous in fight. These they must keep\r\noff from their eyes, and so cut the cassia.\r\n\r\n111. Cinnamon they collect in a yet more marvellous manner than this:\r\nfor where it grows and what land produces it they are not able to tell,\r\nexcept only that some say (and it is a probable account) that it grows\r\nin those regions where Dionysos was brought up; and they say that large\r\nbirds carry those dried sticks which we have learnt from the Phenicians\r\nto call cinnamon, carry them, I say, to nests which are made of clay and\r\nstuck on to precipitous sides of mountains, which man can find no means\r\nof scaling. With regard to this then the Arabians practise the following\r\ncontrivance:—they divide up the limbs of the oxen and asses that die and\r\nof their other beasts of burden, into pieces as large as convenient, and\r\nconvey them to these places, and when they have laid them down not far\r\nfrom the nests, they withdraw to a distance from them: and the birds fly\r\ndown and carry the limbs 100 of the beasts of burden off to their nests;\r\nand these are not able to bear them, but break down and fall to the\r\nearth; and the men come up to them and collect the cinnamon. Thus\r\ncinnamon is collected and comes from this nation to the other countries\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n112. Gum-mastich however, which the Arabians call ladanon, comes in a\r\nstill more extraordinary manner; for though it is the most sweet-scented\r\nof all things, it comes in the most evil-scented thing, since it is\r\nfound in the beards of he-goats, produced there like resin from wood:\r\nthis is of use for the making of many perfumes, and the Arabians use it\r\nmore than anything else as incense.\r\n\r\n113. Let what we have said suffice with regard to spices; and from the\r\nland of Arabia there blows a scent of them most marvellously sweet. They\r\nhave also two kinds of sheep which are worthy of admiration and are not\r\nfound in any other land: the one kind has the tail long, not less than\r\nthree cubits in length; and if one should allow these to drag these\r\nafter them, they would have sores 101 from their tails being worn away\r\nagainst the ground; but as it is, every one of the shepherds knows\r\nenough of carpentering to make little cars, which they tie under the\r\ntails, fastening the tail of each animal to a separate little car.\r\nThe other kind of sheep has the tail broad, even as much as a cubit in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\n114. As one passes beyond the place of the midday, the Ethiopian land is\r\nthat which extends furthest of all inhabited lands towards the sunset.\r\nThis produces both gold in abundance and huge elephants and trees of all\r\nkinds growing wild and ebony, and men who are of all men the tallest,\r\nthe most beautiful and the most long-lived.\r\n\r\n115. These are the extremities in Asia and in Libya; but as to the\r\nextremities of Europe towards the West, I am not able to speak with\r\ncertainty: for neither do I accept the tale that there is a river called\r\nin Barbarian tongue Eridanos, flowing into the sea which lies towards\r\nthe North Wind, whence it is said that amber comes; nor do I know of the\r\nreal existence of \"Tin Islands\" 102 from which tin 103 comes to us: for\r\nfirst the name Eridanos itself declares that it is Hellenic and that it\r\ndoes not belong to a Barbarian speech, but was invented by some\r\npoet; and secondly I am not able to hear from any one who has been an\r\neye-witness, though I took pains to discover this, that there is a\r\nsea on the other side of Europe. However that may be, tin and amber\r\ncertainly come to us from the extremity of Europe.\r\n\r\n116. Then again towards the North of Europe, there is evidently a\r\nquantity of gold by far larger than in any other land: as to how it is\r\ngot, here again I am not able to say for certain, but it is said to be\r\ncarried off from the griffins by Arimaspians, a one-eyed race of men.\r\n104 But I do not believe this tale either, that nature produces one-eyed\r\nmen which in all other respects are like other men. However, it would\r\nseem that the extremities which bound the rest of the world on every\r\nside and enclose it in the midst, possess the things which by us are\r\nthought to be the most beautiful and the most rare.\r\n\r\n117. Now there is a plain in Asia bounded by mountains on all sides, and\r\nthrough the mountains there are five clefts. This plain belonged once\r\nto the Chorasmians, and it lies on the borders of the Chorasmians\r\nthemselves, the Hyrcanians, Parthians, Sarangians, and Thamanaians; but\r\nfrom the time that the Persians began to bear rule it belongs to the\r\nking. From this enclosing mountain of which I speak there flows a great\r\nriver, and its name is Akes. This formerly watered the lands of these\r\nnations which have been mentioned, being divided into five streams and\r\nconducted through a separate cleft in the mountains to each separate\r\nnation; but from the time that they have come to be under the Persians\r\nthey have suffered as follows:—the king built up the clefts in the\r\nmountains and set gates at each cleft; and so, since the water has been\r\nshut off from its outlet, the plain within the mountains is made into a\r\nsea, because the river runs into it and has no way out in any direction.\r\nThose therefore who in former times had been wont to make use of the\r\nwater, not being able now to make use of it are in great trouble: for\r\nduring the winter they have rain from heaven, as also other men have,\r\nbut in the summer they desire to use the water when they sow millet and\r\nsesame seed. So then, the water not being granted to them, they come to\r\nthe Persians both themselves and their wives, and standing at the gates\r\nof the king's court they cry and howl; and the king orders that for\r\nthose who need it most, the gates which lead to their land shall be\r\nopened; and when their land has become satiated with drinking in the\r\nwater, these gates are closed, and he orders the gates to be opened for\r\nothers, that is to say those most needing it of the rest who remain:\r\nand, as I have heard, he exacts large sums of money for opening them,\r\nbesides the regular tribute.\r\n\r\n118. Thus it is with these matters: but of the seven men who had risen\r\nagainst the Magian, it happened to one, namely Intaphrenes, to be put to\r\ndeath immediately after their insurrection for an outrage which I shall\r\nrelate. He desired to enter into the king's palace and confer with the\r\nking; for the law was in fact so, that those who had risen up against\r\nthe Magian were permitted to go in to the king's presence without any\r\none to announce them, unless the king happened to be lying with his\r\nwife. Accordingly Intaphrenes did not think it fit that any one should\r\nannounce his coming; but as he was one of the seven, he desired to\r\nenter. The gatekeeper however and the bearer of messages endeavoured\r\nto prevent him, saying that the king was lying with his wife: but\r\nIntaphrenes believing that they were not speaking the truth, drew his\r\nsword 105 and cut off their ears and their noses, and stringing these\r\nupon his horse's bridle he tied them round their necks and so let them\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n119. Upon this they showed themselves to the king and told the cause for\r\nwhich they had suffered this; and Dareios, fearing that the six might\r\nhave done this by common design, sent for each one separately and made\r\ntrial of his inclinations, as to whether he approved of that which had\r\nbeen done: and when he was fully assured that Intaphrenes had not done\r\nthis in combination with them, he took both Intaphrenes himself and his\r\nsons and all his kinsmen, being much disposed to believe that he was\r\nplotting insurrection against him with the help of his relations; and\r\nhaving seized them he put them in bonds as for execution. Then the wife\r\nof Intaphrenes, coming constantly to the doors of the king's court,\r\nwept and bewailed herself; and by doing this continually after the same\r\nmanner she moved Dareios to pity her. Accordingly he sent a messenger\r\nand said to her: \"Woman, king Dareios grants to thee to save from death\r\none of thy kinsmen who are lying in bonds, whomsoever thou desirest of\r\nthem all.\" She then, having considered with herself, answered thus: \"If\r\nin truth the king grants me the life of one, I choose of them all my\r\nbrother.\" Dareios being informed of this, and marvelling at her speech,\r\nsent and addressed her thus: \"Woman, the king asks thee what was in thy\r\nmind, that thou didst leave thy husband and thy children to die, and\r\ndidst choose thy brother to survive, seeing that he is surely less\r\nnear to thee in blood than thy children, and less dear to thee than\r\nthy husband.\" She made answer: \"O king, I might, if heaven willed, have\r\nanother husband and other children, if I should lose these; but another\r\nbrother I could by no means have, seeing that my father and my mother\r\nare no longer alive. This was in my mind when I said those words.\" To\r\nDareios then it seemed that the woman had spoken well, and he let go\r\nnot only him for whose life she asked, but also the eldest of her\r\nsons because he was pleased with her: but all the others he slew. One\r\ntherefore of the seven had perished immediately in the manner which has\r\nbeen related.\r\n\r\n120. Now about the time of the sickness of Cambyses it had come to pass\r\nas follows:—There was one Oroites, a Persian, who had been appointed by\r\nCyrus to be governor of the province of Sardis. 106 This man had set his\r\ndesire upon an unholy thing; for though from Polycrates the Samian he\r\nhad never suffered anything nor heard any offensive word nor even seen\r\nhim before that time, he desired to take him and put him to death for\r\na reason of this kind, as most who report the matter say:—while Oroites\r\nand another Persian whose name was Mitrobates, ruler of the province of\r\nDaskyleion, 107 were sitting at the door of the king's court, they came\r\nfrom words to strife with one another; and as they debated their several\r\nclaims to excellence, Mitrobates taunting Oroites said: \"Dost thou 108\r\ncount thyself a man, who didst never yet win for the king the island of\r\nSamos, which lies close to thy province, when it is so exceedingly easy\r\nof conquest that one of the natives of it rose up against the government\r\nwith fifteen men-at-arms and got possession of the island, and is now\r\ndespot of it?\" Some say that because he heard this and was stung by the\r\nreproach, he formed the desire, not so much to take vengeance on him who\r\nsaid this, as to bring Polycrates to destruction at all costs, since by\r\nreason of him he was ill spoken of:\r\n\r\n121, the lesser number however of those who tell the tale say that\r\nOroites sent a herald to Samos to ask for something or other, but what\r\nit was is not mentioned; and Polycrates happened to be lying down in the\r\nmen's chamber 109 of his palace, and Anacreon also of Teos was present\r\nwith him: and somehow, whether it was by intention and because he made\r\nno account of the business of Oroites, or whether some chance occurred\r\nto bring it about, it happened that the envoy of Oroites came into his\r\npresence and spoke with him, and Polycrates, who chanced to be turned\r\naway 110 towards the wall, neither turned round at all nor made any\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n122. The cause then of the death of Polycrates is reported in these two\r\ndifferent ways, and we may believe whichever of them we please. Oroites\r\nhowever, having his residence at that Magnesia which is situated upon\r\nthe river Maiander, sent Myrsos the son of Gyges, a Lydian, to Samos\r\nbearing a message, since he had perceived the designs of Polycrates. For\r\nPolycrates was the first of the Hellenes of whom we have any knowledge,\r\nwho set his mind upon having command of the sea, excepting Minos the\r\nCnossian and any other who may have had command of the sea before his\r\ntime. Of that which we call mortal race Polycrates was the first; and\r\nhe had great expectation of becoming ruler of Ionia and of the islands.\r\nOroites accordingly, having perceived that he had this design, sent a\r\nmessage to him and said thus: \"Oroites to Polycrates saith as follows:\r\nI hear that thou art making plans to get great power, and that thou hast\r\nnot wealth according to thy high thoughts. Now therefore if thou shalt\r\ndo as I shall say, thou wilt do well for thyself on the one hand, and\r\nalso save me from destruction: for king Cambyses is planning death for\r\nme, and this is reported to me so that I cannot doubt it. Do thou then\r\ncarry away out of danger both myself and with me my wealth; and of\r\nthis keep a part for thyself and a part let me keep, and then so far\r\nas wealth may bring it about, thou shalt be ruler of all Hellas. And if\r\nthou dost not believe that which I say about the money, send some one,\r\nwhosoever happens to be most trusted by thee, and to him I will show\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n123. Polycrates having heard this rejoiced, and was disposed to agree;\r\nand as he had a great desire, it seems, for wealth, he first sent\r\nMaiandrios the son of Maiandrios, a native of Samos who was his\r\nsecretary, to see it: this man was the same who not long after these\r\nevents dedicated all the ornaments of the men's chamber in the palace of\r\nPolycrates, ornaments well worth seeing, as an offering to the temple of\r\nHera. Oroites accordingly, having heard that the person sent to examine\r\nmight be expected soon to come, did as follows, that is to say, he\r\nfilled eight chests with stones except a small depth at the very top of\r\neach, and laid gold above upon the stones; then he tied up the chests\r\nand kept them in readiness. So Maiandrios came and looked at them and\r\nbrought back word to Polycrates:\r\n\r\n124, and he upon that prepared to set out thither, although the diviners\r\nand also his friends strongly dissuaded him from it, and in spite\r\nmoreover of a vision which his daughter had seen in sleep of this\r\nkind,—it seemed to her that her father was raised up on high and was\r\nbathed by Zeus and anointed by the Sun. Having seen this vision, she\r\nused every kind of endeavour to dissuade Polycrates from leaving\r\nhis land to go to Oroites, and besides that, as he was going to his\r\nfifty-oared galley she accompanied his departure with prophetic words:\r\nand he threatened her that if he should return safe, she should remain\r\nunmarried for long; but she prayed that this might come to pass, for she\r\ndesired rather, she said, to be unmarried for long than to be an orphan,\r\nhaving lost her father.\r\n\r\n125. Polycrates however neglected every counsel and set sail to go to\r\nOroites, taking with him, besides many others of his friends, Demokedes\r\nalso the son of Calliphon, a man of Croton, who was a physician and\r\npractised his art better than any other man of his time. Then when he\r\narrived at Magnesia, Polycrates was miserably put to death in a manner\r\nunworthy both of himself and of his high ambition: for excepting those\r\nwho become despots of the Syracusans, not one besides of the Hellenic\r\ndespots is worthy to be compared with Polycrates in magnificence. And\r\nwhen he had killed him in a manner not fit to be told, Oroites impaled\r\nhis body: and of those who accompanied him, as many as were Samians he\r\nreleased, bidding them be grateful to him that they were free men; but\r\nall those of his company who were either allies or servants, he held in\r\nthe estimation of slaves and kept them. Polycrates then being hung up\r\naccomplished wholly the vision of his daughter, for he was bathed by\r\nZeus whenever it rained, 11001 and anointed by the Sun, giving forth\r\nmoisture himself from his body.\r\n\r\n126. To this end came the great prosperity of Polycrates, as Amasis\r\nthe king of Egypt had foretold to him: 111 but not long afterwards\r\nretribution overtook Oroites in his turn for the murder of Polycrates.\r\nFor after the death of Cambyses and the reign of the Magians Oroites\r\nremained at Sardis and did no service to the Persians, when they had\r\nbeen deprived of their empire by the Medes; moreover during this time\r\nof disturbance he slew Mitrobates the governor in Daskyleion, who had\r\nbrought up against him the matter of Polycrates as a reproach; and he\r\nslew also Cranaspes the son of Mitrobates, both men of repute among\r\nthe Persians: and besides other various deeds of insolence, once when a\r\nbearer of messages had come to him from Dareios, not being pleased with\r\nthe message which he brought he slew him as he was returning, having set\r\nmen to lie in wait for him by the way; and having slain him he made away\r\nwith the bodies both of the man and of his horse.\r\n\r\n127. Dareios accordingly, when he had come to the throne, was desirous\r\nof taking vengeance upon Oroites for all his wrongdoings and especially\r\nfor the murder of Mitrobates and his son. However he did not think\r\nit good to act openly and to send an army against him, since his own\r\naffairs were still in a disturbed state 112 and he had only lately come\r\nto the throne, while he heard that the strength of Oroites was great,\r\nseeing that he had a bodyguard of a thousand Persian spearmen and was\r\nin possession of the divisions 113 of Phrygia and Lydia and Ionia.\r\nTherefore Dareios contrived as follows:—having called together those of\r\nthe Persians who were of most repute, he said to them: \"Persians, which\r\nof you all will undertake to perform this matter for me with wisdom,\r\nand not by force or with tumult? for where wisdom is wanted, there is no\r\nneed of force. Which of you, I say, will either bring Oroites alive to\r\nme or slay him? for he never yet did any service to the Persians, and on\r\nthe other hand he has done to them great evil. First he destroyed two of\r\nus, Mitrobates and his son; then he slays the men who go to summon him,\r\nsent by me, displaying insolence not to be endured. Before therefore he\r\nshall accomplish any other evil against the Persians, we must check his\r\ncourse by death.\"\r\n\r\n128. Thus Dareios asked, and thirty men undertook the matter, each\r\none separately desiring to do it himself; and Dareios stopped their\r\ncontention and bade them cast lots: so when they cast lots, Bagaios\r\nthe son of Artontes obtained the lot from among them all. Bagaios\r\naccordingly, having obtained the lot, did thus:—he wrote many papers\r\ndealing with various matters and on them set the seal of Dareios, and\r\nwith them he went to Sardis. When he arrived there and came into the\r\npresence of Oroites, he took the covers off the papers one after another\r\nand gave them to the Royal Secretary to read; for all the governors of\r\nprovinces have Royal Secretaries. Now Bagaios thus gave the papers in\r\norder to make trial of the spearmen of the guard, whether they would\r\naccept the motion to revolt from Oroites; and seeing that they paid\r\ngreat reverence to the papers and still more to the words which were\r\nrecited from them, he gave another paper in which were contained\r\nthese words: \"Persians, king Dareios forbids you to serve as guards\r\nto Oroites\": and they hearing this lowered to him the points of their\r\nspears. Then Bagaios, seeing that in this they were obedient to the\r\npaper, took courage upon that and gave the last of the papers to the\r\nsecretary; and in it was written: \"King Dareios commands the Persians\r\nwho are in Sardis to slay Oroites.\" So the spearmen of the guard, when\r\nthey heard this, drew their swords and slew him forthwith. Thus did\r\nretribution for the murder of Polycrates the Samian overtake Oroites.\r\n\r\n129. When the wealth of Oroites had come or had been carried 114 up to\r\nSusa, it happened not long after, that king Dareios while engaged in\r\nhunting wild beasts twisted his foot in leaping off his horse, and\r\nit was twisted, as it seems, rather violently, for the ball of his\r\nankle-joint was put out of the socket. Now he had been accustomed to\r\nkeep about him those of the Egyptians who were accounted the first in\r\nthe art of medicine, and he made use of their assistance then: but these\r\nby wrenching and forcing the foot made the evil continually greater. For\r\nseven days then and seven nights Dareios was sleepless owing to the\r\npain which he suffered; and at last on the eighth day, when he was in a\r\nwretched state, some one who had heard talk before while yet at Sardis\r\nof the skill of Demokedes of Croton, reported this to Dareios; and he\r\nbade them bring him forthwith into his presence. So having found him\r\nsomewhere unnoticed among the slaves of Oroites, they brought him forth\r\ninto the midst dragging fetters after him and clothed in rags.\r\n\r\n130. When he had been placed in the midst of them, Dareios asked him\r\nwhether he understood the art; but he would not admit it, fearing lest,\r\nif he declared himself to be what he was, he might lose for ever\r\nthe hope of returning to Hellas: and it was clear to Dareios that he\r\nunderstood that art but was practising another, 115 and he commanded\r\nthose who had brought him thither to produce scourges and pricks.\r\nAccordingly upon that he spoke out, saying that he did not understand\r\nit precisely, but that he had kept company with a physician and had some\r\npoor knowledge of the art. Then after this, when Dareios had committed\r\nthe case to him, by using Hellenic drugs and applying mild remedies\r\nafter the former violent means, he caused him to get sleep, and in a\r\nshort time made him perfectly well, though he had never hoped to be\r\nsound of foot again. Upon this Dareios presented him with two pairs of\r\ngolden fetters; and he asked him whether it was by design that he had\r\ngiven to him a double share of his suffering, because he had made him\r\nwell. Being pleased by this saying, Dareios sent him to visit his wives,\r\nand the eunuchs in bringing him in said to the women that this was he\r\nwho had restored to the king his life. Then each one of them plunged a\r\ncup into the gold-chest 116 and presented Demokedes with so abundant a\r\ngift that his servant, whose name was Skiton, following and gathering\r\nup the coins 117 which fell from the cups, collected for himself a very\r\nlarge sum of gold.\r\n\r\n131. This Demokedes came from Croton, and became the associate of\r\nPolycrates in the following manner:—at Croton he lived in strife with\r\nhis father, who was of a harsh temper, and when he could no longer\r\nendure him, he departed and came to Egina. Being established there he\r\nsurpassed in the first year all the other physicians, although he was\r\nwithout appliances and had none of the instruments which are used in the\r\nart. In the next year the Eginetan State engaged him for a payment of\r\none talent, in the third year he was engaged by the Athenians for a\r\nhundred pounds weight of silver, 118 and in the fourth by Polycrates for\r\ntwo talents. Thus he arrived in Samos; and it was by reason of this\r\nman more than anything else that the physicians of Croton got their\r\nreputation: for this event happened at the time when the physicians of\r\nCroton began to be spoken of as the first in Hellas, while the Kyrenians\r\nwere reputed to have the second place. About this same time also the\r\nArgives had the reputation of being the first musicians in Hellas. 119\r\n\r\n132. Then Demokedes having healed king Dareios had a very great house\r\nin Susa, and had been made a table-companion of the king; and except the\r\none thing of returning to the land of the Hellenes, he had everything.\r\nAnd first as regards the Egyptian physicians who tried to heal the king\r\nbefore him, when they were about to be impaled because they had proved\r\ninferior to a physician who was a Hellene, he asked their lives of the\r\nking and rescued them from death: then secondly, he rescued an Eleian\r\nprophet, who had accompanied Polycrates and had remained unnoticed among\r\nthe slaves. In short Demokedes was very great in the favour of the king.\r\n\r\n133. Not long time after this another thing came to pass which was\r\nthis:—Atossa the daughter of Cyrus and wife of Dareios had a tumour upon\r\nher breast, which afterwards burst and then was spreading further:\r\nand so long as it was not large, she concealed it and said nothing to\r\nanybody, because she was ashamed; but afterwards when she was in evil\r\ncase, she sent for Demokedes and showed it to him: and he said that he\r\nwould make her well, and caused her to swear that she would surely do\r\nfor him in return that which he should ask of her; and he would ask, he\r\nsaid, none of such things as are shameful.\r\n\r\n134. So when after this by his treatment he had made her well, then\r\nAtossa instructed by Demokedes uttered to Dareios in his bedchamber some\r\nsuch words as these: \"O king, though thou hast such great power, thou\r\ndost sit still, and dost not win in addition any nation or power for\r\nthe Persians: and yet it is reasonable that a man who is both young\r\nand master of much wealth should be seen to perform some great deed, in\r\norder that the Persians may know surely that he is a man by whom they\r\nare ruled. It is expedient indeed in two ways that thou shouldest do so,\r\nboth in order that the Persians may know that their ruler is a man, and\r\nin order that they may be worn down by war and not have leisure to plot\r\nagainst thee. For now thou mightest display some great deed, while thou\r\nart still young; seeing that as the body grows the spirit grows old\r\nalso with it, and is blunted for every kind of action.\" Thus she spoke\r\naccording to instructions received, and he answered thus: \"Woman, thou\r\nhast said all the things which I myself have in mind to do; for I have\r\nmade the plan to yoke together a bridge from this continent to the other\r\nand to make expedition against the Scythians, and these designs will be\r\nby way of being fulfilled within a little time.\" Then Atossa said: \"Look\r\nnow,—forbear to go first against the Scythians, for these will be in\r\nthy power whenever thou desirest: but do thou, I pray thee, make an\r\nexpedition against Hellas; for I am desirous to have Lacedemonian women\r\nand Argive and Athenian and Corinthian, for attendants, because I hear\r\nof them by report: and thou hast the man who of all men is most fitted\r\nto show thee all things which relate to Hellas and to be thy guide, that\r\nman, I mean, who healed thy foot.\" Dareios made answer: \"Woman, since it\r\nseems good to thee that we should first make trial of Hellas, I think\r\nit better to send first to them men of the Persians together with him of\r\nwhom thou speakest, to make investigation, that when these have learnt\r\nand seen, they may report each several thing to us; and then I shall go\r\nto attack them with full knowledge of all.\"\r\n\r\n135. Thus he said, and he proceeded to do the deed as he spoke the word:\r\nfor as soon as day dawned, he summoned fifteen Persians, men of\r\nrepute, and bade them pass through the coasts of Hellas in company with\r\nDemokedes, and take care not to let Demokedes escape from them, but\r\nbring him back at all costs. Having thus commanded them, next he\r\nsummoned Demokedes himself and asked him to act as a guide for the whole\r\nof Hellas and show it to the Persians, and then return back: and he bade\r\nhim take all his movable goods and carry them as gifts to his father and\r\nhis brothers, saying that he would give him in their place many times\r\nas much; and besides this, he said, he would contribute to the gifts a\r\nmerchant ship filled with all manner of goods, which should sail with\r\nhim. Dareios, as it seems to me, promised him these things with no\r\ncrafty design; but Demokedes was afraid that Dareios was making trial\r\nof him, and did not make haste to accept all that was offered, but said\r\nthat he would leave his own things where they were, so that he might\r\nhave them when he came back; he said however that he accepted the\r\nmerchant ship which Dareios promised him for the presents to his\r\nbrothers. Dareios then, having thus given command to him also, sent them\r\naway to the sea.\r\n\r\n136. So these, when they had gone down to Phenicia and in Phenicia to\r\nthe city of Sidon, forthwith manned two triremes, and besides them they\r\nalso filled a large ship of burden with all manner of goods. Then when\r\nthey had made all things ready they set sail for Hellas, and touching\r\nat various places they saw the coast regions of it and wrote down a\r\ndescription, until at last, when they had seen the greater number of the\r\nfamous places, they came to Taras 120 in Italy. There from complaisance\r\n121 to Demokedes Aristophilides the king of the Tarentines unfastened\r\nand removed the steering-oars of the Median ships, and also confined the\r\nPersians in prison, because, as he alleged, they came as spies. While\r\nthey were being thus dealt with, Demokedes went away and reached Croton;\r\nand when he had now reached his own native place, Aristophilides set the\r\nPersians free and gave back to them those parts of their ships which he\r\nhad taken away.\r\n\r\n137. The Persians then sailing thence and pursuing Demokedes reached\r\nCroton, and finding him in the market-place they laid hands upon him;\r\nand some of the men of Croton fearing the Persian power were willing to\r\nlet him go, but others took hold of him and struck with their staves at\r\nthe Persians, who pleaded for themselves in these words: \"Men of Croton,\r\ntake care what ye are about: ye are rescuing a man who was a slave\r\nof king Dareios and who ran away from him. How, think you, will king\r\nDareios be content to receive such an insult; and how shall this which\r\nye do be well for you, if ye take him away from us? Against what city,\r\nthink you, shall we make expedition sooner than against this, and what\r\ncity before this shall we endeavour to reduce to slavery?\" Thus\r\nsaying they did not however persuade the men of Croton, but having\r\nhad Demokedes rescued from them and the ship of burden which they were\r\nbringing with them taken away, they set sail to go back to Asia, and\r\ndid not endeavour to visit any more parts of Hellas or to find out about\r\nthem, being now deprived of their guide. This much however Demokedes\r\ngave them as a charge when they were putting forth to sea, bidding them\r\nsay to Dareios that Demokedes was betrothed to the daughter of Milon:\r\nfor the wrestler Milon had a great name at the king's court; and I\r\nsuppose that Demokedes was urgent for this marriage, spending much\r\nmoney to further it, in order that Dareios might see that he was held in\r\nhonour also in his own country.\r\n\r\n138. The Persians however, after they had put out from Croton, were cast\r\naway with their ships in Iapygia; and as they were remaining there as\r\nslaves, Gillos a Tarentine exile rescued them and brought them back to\r\nking Dareios. In return for this Dareios offered to give him whatsoever\r\nthing he should desire; and Gillos chose that he might have the power of\r\nreturning to Taras, narrating first the story of his misfortune: and in\r\norder that he might not disturb all Hellas, as would be the case if on\r\nhis account a great armament should sail to invade Italy, he said it was\r\nenough for him that the men of Cnidos should be those who brought him\r\nback, without any others; because he supposed that by these, who were\r\nfriends with the Tarentines, his return from exile would most easily be\r\neffected. Dareios accordingly having promised proceeded to perform; for\r\nhe sent a message to Cnidos and bade them being back Gillos to Taras:\r\nand the men of Cnidos obeyed Dareios, but nevertheless they did not\r\npersuade the Tarentines, and they were not strong enough to apply force.\r\nThus then it happened with regard to these things; and these were the\r\nfirst Persians who came from Asia to Hellas, and for the reason which\r\nhas been mentioned these were sent as spies.\r\n\r\n139. After this king Dareios took Samos before all other cities, whether\r\nof Hellenes or Barbarians, and for a cause which was as follows:—When\r\nCambyses the son of Cyrus was marching upon Egypt, many Hellenes arrived\r\nin Egypt, some, as might be expected, joining in the campaign to make\r\nprofit, 122 and some also coming to see the land itself; and among these\r\nwas Syloson the son of Aiakes and brother of Polycrates, an exile from\r\nSamos. To this Syloson a fortunate chance occurred, which was this:—he\r\nhad taken and put upon him a flame-coloured mantle, and was about the\r\nmarket-place in Memphis; and Dareios, who was then one of the spearmen\r\nof Cambyses and not yet held in any great estimation, seeing him had\r\na desire for the mantle, and going up to him offered to buy it. Then\r\nSyloson, seeing that Dareios very greatly desired the mantle, by some\r\ndivine inspiration said: \"I will not sell this for any sum, but I will\r\ngive it thee for nothing, if, as it appears, it must be thine at all\r\ncosts.\" To this Dareios agreed and received from him the garment.\r\n\r\n140. Now Syloson supposed without any doubt that he had altogether lost\r\nthis by easy simplicity; but when in course of time Cambyses was dead,\r\nand the seven Persians had risen up against the Magian, and of the seven\r\nDareios had obtained the kingdom, Syloson heard that the kingdom had\r\ncome about to that man to whom once in Egypt he had given the garment at\r\nhis request: accordingly he went up to Susa and sat down at the entrance\r\n123 of the king's palace, and said that he was a benefactor of Dareios.\r\nThe keeper of the door hearing this reported it to the king; and\r\nhe marvelled at it and said to him: \"Who then of the Hellenes is my\r\nbenefactor, to whom I am bound by gratitude? seeing that it is now but\r\na short time that I possess the kingdom, and as yet scarcely one 124 of\r\nthem has come up to our court; and I may almost say that I have no debt\r\nowing to a Hellene. Nevertheless bring him in before me, that I may know\r\nwhat he means when he says these things.\" Then the keeper of the door\r\nbrought Syloson before him, and when he had been set in the midst, the\r\ninterpreters asked him who he was and what he had done, that he called\r\nhimself the benefactor of the king. Syloson accordingly told all that\r\nhad happened about the mantle, and how he was the man who had given it;\r\nto which Dareios made answer: \"O most noble of men, thou art he who\r\nwhen as yet I had no power gavest me a gift, small it may be, but\r\nnevertheless the kindness is counted with me to be as great as if I\r\nshould now receive some great thing from some one. Therefore I will give\r\nthee in return gold and silver in abundance, that thou mayest not\r\never repent that thou didst render a service to Dareios the son of\r\nHystaspes.\" To this Syloson replied: \"To me, O king, give neither gold\r\nnor silver, but recover and give to me my fatherland Samos, which now\r\nthat my brother Polycrates has been slain by Oroites is possessed by our\r\nslave. This give to me without bloodshed or selling into slavery.\"\r\n\r\n141. Dareios having heard this prepared to send an expedition with\r\nOtanes as commander of it, who had been one of the seven, charging him\r\nto accomplish for Syloson all that which he had requested. Otanes then\r\nwent down to the sea-coast and was preparing the expedition.\r\n\r\n142. Now Maiandrios the son of Maiandrios was holding the rule over\r\nSamos, having received the government as a trust from Polycrates; and\r\nhe, though desiring to show himself the most righteous of men, did not\r\nsucceed in so doing: for when the death of Polycrates was reported to\r\nhim, he did as follows:—first he founded an altar to Zeus the Liberator\r\nand marked out a sacred enclosure round it, namely that which exists\r\nstill in the suburb of the city: then after he had done this he gathered\r\ntogether an assembly of all the citizens and spoke these words: \"To me,\r\nas ye know as well as I, has been entrusted the sceptre of Polycrates\r\nand all his power; and now it is open to me to be your ruler; but that\r\nfor the doing of which I find fault with my neighbour, I will myself\r\nrefrain from doing, so far as I may: for as I did not approve of\r\nPolycrates acting as master of men who were not inferior to himself, so\r\nneither do I approve of any other who does such things. Now Polycrates\r\nfor his part fulfilled his own appointed destiny, and I now give the\r\npower into the hands of the people, and proclaim to you equality. 125\r\nThese privileges however I think it right to have assigned to me, namely\r\nthat from the wealth of Polycrates six talents should be taken out and\r\ngiven to me as a special gift; and in addition to this I choose for\r\nmyself and for my descendants in succession the priesthood of Zeus the\r\nLiberator, to whom I myself founded a temple, while I bestow liberty\r\nupon you.\" He, as I say, made these offers to the Samians; but one of\r\nthem rose up and said: \"Nay, but unworthy too art thou 126 to be\r\nour ruler, seeing that thou art of mean birth and a pestilent fellow\r\nbesides. Rather take care that thou give an account of the money which\r\nthou hadst to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n143. Thus said one who was a man of repute among the citizens, whose\r\nname was Telesarchos; and Maiandrios perceiving that if he resigned the\r\npower, some other would be set up as despot instead of himself, did not\r\nkeep the purpose at all 127 of resigning it; but having retired to the\r\nfortress he sent for each man separately, pretending that he was going\r\nto give an account of the money, and so seized them and put them in\r\nbonds. These then had been put in bonds; but Maiandrios after this\r\nwas overtaken by sickness, and his brother, whose name was Lycaretos,\r\nexpecting that he would die, put all the prisoners to death, in order\r\nthat he might himself more easily get possession of the power over\r\nSamos: and all this happened because, as it appears, they did not choose\r\nto be free.\r\n\r\n144. So when the Persians arrived at Samos bringing Syloson home from\r\nexile, no one raised a hand against them, and moreover the party of\r\nMaiandrios and Maiandrios himself said that they were ready to retire\r\nout of the island under a truce. Otanes therefore having agreed on these\r\nterms and having made a treaty, the most honourable of the Persians had\r\nseats placed for them in front of the fortress and were sitting there.\r\n\r\n145. Now the despot Maiandrios had a brother who was somewhat mad, and\r\nhis name was Charilaos. This man for some offence which he had been\r\ncommitted had been confined in an underground dungeon, 128 and at this\r\ntime of which I speak, having heard what was being done and having put\r\nhis head through out of the dungeon, when he saw the Persians peacefully\r\nsitting there he began to cry out and said that he desired to come to\r\nspeech with Maiandrios. So Maiandrios hearing his voice bade them loose\r\nhim and bring him into his presence; and as soon as he was brought he\r\nbegan to abuse and revile him, trying to persuade him to attack the\r\nPersians, and saying thus: \"Thou basest of men, didst thou put me in\r\nbonds and judge me worthy of the dungeon under ground, who am thine\r\nown brother and did no wrong worthy of bonds, and when thou seest the\r\nPersians casting thee forth from the land and making thee homeless, dost\r\nthou not dare to take any revenge, though they are so exceedingly easy\r\nto be overcome? Nay, but if in truth thou art afraid of them, give me\r\nthy mercenaries and I will take vengeance on them for their coming here;\r\nand thyself I am willing to let go out of the island.\"\r\n\r\n146. Thus spoke Charilaos, and Maiandrios accepted that which he said,\r\nnot, as I think, because he had reached such a height of folly as to\r\nsuppose that his own power would overcome that of the king, but rather\r\nbecause he grudged Syloson that he should receive from him the State\r\nwithout trouble, and with no injury inflicted upon it. Therefore he\r\ndesired to provoke the Persians to anger and make the Samian power as\r\nfeeble as possible before he gave it up to him, being well assured that\r\nthe Persians, when they had suffered evil, would be likely to be as\r\nbitter against the Samians as well as against those who did the wrong,\r\n129 and knowing also that he had a safe way of escape from the island\r\nwhenever he desired: for he had had a secret passage made under ground,\r\nleading from the fortress to the sea. Maiandrios then himself sailed out\r\nfrom Samos; but Charilaos armed all the mercenaries, and opening wide\r\nthe gates sent them out upon the Persians, who were not expecting any\r\nsuch thing, but supposed that all had been arranged: and the mercenaries\r\nfalling upon them began to slay those of the Persians who had seats\r\ncarried for them 130 and were of most account. While these were thus\r\nengaged, the rest of the Persian force came to the rescue, and the\r\nmercenaries were hard pressed and forced to retire to the fortress.\r\n\r\n147. Then Otanes the Persian commander, seeing that the Persians had\r\nsuffered greatly, purposely forgot the commands which Dareios gave him\r\nwhen he sent him forth, not to kill any one of the Samians nor to sell\r\nany into slavery, but to restore the island to Syloson free from all\r\nsuffering of calamity,—these commands, I say, he purposely forgot, and\r\ngave the word to his army to slay every one whom they should take, man\r\nor boy, without distinction. So while some of the army were besieging\r\nthe fortress, others were slaying every one who came in their way, in\r\nsanctuary or out of sanctuary equally.\r\n\r\n148. Meanwhile Maiandrios had escaped from Samos and was sailing to\r\nLacedemon; and having come thither and caused to be brought up to the\r\ncity the things which he had taken with him when he departed, he did\r\nas follows:—first, he would set out his cups of silver and of gold,\r\nand then while the servants were cleaning them, he would be engaged\r\nin conversation with Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides, then king of\r\nSparta, and would bring him on to his house; and when Cleomenes saw the\r\ncups he marvelled and was astonished at them, and Maiandrios would bid\r\nhim take away with him as many of them as he pleased. Maiandrios said\r\nthis twice or three times, but Cleomenes herein showed himself the most\r\nupright of men; for he not only did not think fit to take that which was\r\noffered, but perceiving that Maiandrios would make presents to others\r\nof the citizens, and so obtain assistance for himself, he went to the\r\nEphors and said that it was better for Sparta that the stranger of Samos\r\nshould depart from Peloponnesus, lest he might persuade either himself\r\nor some other man of the Spartans to act basely. They accordingly\r\naccepted his counsel, and expelled Maiandrios by proclamation.\r\n\r\n149. As to Samos, the Persians, after sweeping the population off it,\r\n131 delivered it to Syloson stripped of men. Afterwards however the\r\ncommander Otanes even joined in settling people there, moved by a vision\r\nof a dream and by a disease which seized him, so that he was diseased in\r\nthe genital organs.\r\n\r\n150. After a naval force had thus gone against Samos, the Babylonians\r\nmade revolt, being for this exceedingly well prepared; for during all\r\nthe time of the reign of the Magian and of the insurrection of the\r\nseven, during all this time and the attendant confusion they were\r\npreparing themselves for the siege of their city: and it chanced by some\r\nmeans that they were not observed to be doing this. Then when they made\r\nopen revolt, they did as follows:—after setting apart their mothers\r\nfirst, each man set apart also for himself one woman, whosoever he\r\nwished of his own household, and all the remainder they gathered\r\ntogether and killed by suffocation. Each man set apart the one who has\r\nbeen mentioned to serve as a maker of bread, and they suffocated the\r\nrest in order that they might not consume their provisions.\r\n\r\n151. Dareios being informed of this and having gathered together all his\r\npower, made expedition against them, and when he had marched his army\r\nup to Babylon he began to besiege them; but they cared nothing about the\r\nsiege, for the Babylonians used to go up to the battlements of the wall\r\nand show contempt of Dareios and of his army by gestures and by words;\r\nand one of them uttered this saying: \"Why, O Persians, do ye remain\r\nsitting here, and not depart? For then only shall ye capture us, when\r\nmules shall bring forth young.\" This was said by one of the Babylonians,\r\nnot supposing that a mule would ever bring forth young.\r\n\r\n152. So when a year and seven months had now passed by, Dareios began\r\nto be vexed and his whole army with him, not being able to conquer the\r\nBabylonians. And yet Dareios had used against them every kind of device\r\nand every possible means, but not even so could he conquer them, though\r\nbesides other devices he had attempted it by that also with which Cyrus\r\nconquered them; but the Babylonians were terribly on their guard and he\r\nwas not able to conquer them.\r\n\r\n153. Then in the twentieth month there happened to Zopyros the son of\r\nthat Megabyzos who had been of the seven men who slew the Magian, to\r\nthis Zopyros, I say, son of Megabyzos there happened a prodigy,—one of\r\nthe mules which served as bearers of provisions for him produced young:\r\nand when this was reported to him, and Zopyros had himself seen the\r\nfoal, because he did not believe the report, he charged those who\r\nhad seen it not to tell that which had happened to any one, and he\r\nconsidered with himself what to do. And having regard to the words\r\nspoken by the Babylonian, who had said at first that when mules should\r\nproduce young, then the wall would be taken, having regard (I say) to\r\nthis ominous saying, it seemed to Zopyros that Babylon could be taken:\r\nfor he thought that both the man had spoken and his mule had produced\r\nyoung by divine dispensation.\r\n\r\n154. Since then it seemed to him that it was now fated that Babylon\r\nshould be captured, he went to Dareios and inquired of him whether he\r\nthought it a matter of very great moment to conquer Babylon; and hearing\r\nin answer that he thought it of great consequence, he considered again\r\nhow he might be the man to take it and how the work might be his own:\r\nfor among the Persians benefits are accounted worthy of a very high\r\ndegree of honour. 132 He considered accordingly that he was not able to\r\nmake conquest of it by any other means, but only if he should maltreat\r\nhimself and desert to their side. So, making light esteem of himself, he\r\nmaltreated his own body in a manner which could not be cured; for he cut\r\noff his nose and his ears, and shaved his hair round in an unseemly way,\r\nand scourged himself, and so went into the presence of Dareios.\r\n\r\n155. And Dareios was exceedingly troubled when he saw the man of most\r\nrepute with him thus maltreated; and leaping up from his seat he cried\r\naloud and asked him who was the person who had maltreated him, and for\r\nwhat deed. He replied: \"That man does not exist, excepting thee, who has\r\nso great power as to bring me into this condition; and not any stranger,\r\nO king, has done this, but I myself to myself, accounting it a very\r\ngrievous thing that the Assyrians should make a mock of the Persians.\"\r\nHe made answer: \"Thou most reckless of men, thou didst set the fairest\r\nname to the foulest deed when thou saidest that on account of those who\r\nare besieged thou didst bring thyself into a condition which cannot be\r\ncured. How, O thou senseless one, will the enemy surrender to us more\r\nquickly, because thou hast maltreated thyself? Surely thou didst wander\r\nout of thy senses in thus destroying thyself.\" And he said, \"If I had\r\ncommunicated to thee that which I was about to do, thou wouldst not have\r\npermitted me to do it; but as it was, I did it on my own account. Now\r\ntherefore, unless something is wanting on thy part, we shall conquer\r\nBabylon: for I shall go straightway as a deserter to the wall; and I\r\nshall say to them that I suffered this treatment at thy hands: and I\r\nthink that when I have convinced them that this is so, I shall obtain\r\nthe command of a part of their forces. Do thou then on the tenth day\r\nfrom that on which I shall enter within the wall take of those troops\r\nabout which thou wilt have no concern if they be destroyed,—of these, I\r\nsay, get a thousand by 133 the gate of the city which is called the gate\r\nof Semiramis; and after this again on the seventh day after the tenth\r\nset, I pray thee, two thousand by the gate which is called the gate of\r\nthe Ninevites; and after this seventh day let twenty days elapse, and\r\nthen lead other four thousand and place them by the gate called the\r\ngate of the Chaldeans: and let neither the former men nor these have any\r\nweapons to defend them except daggers, but this weapon let them have.\r\nThen after the twentieth day at once bid the rest of the army make an\r\nattack on the wall all round, and set the Persians, I pray thee, by\r\nthose gates which are called the gate of Belos and the gate of Kissia:\r\nfor, as I think, when I have displayed great deeds of prowess, the\r\nBabylonians will entrust to me, besides their other things, also the\r\nkeys which draw the bolts of the gates. Then after that it shall be the\r\ncare of myself and the Persians to do that which ought to be done.\"\r\n\r\n156. Having thus enjoined he proceeded to go to the gate of the\r\ncity, turning to look behind him as he went, as if he were in truth a\r\ndeserter; and those who were set in that part of the wall, seeing him\r\nfrom the towers ran down, and slightly opening one wing of the gate\r\nasked who he was, and for what purpose he had come. And he addressed\r\nthem and said that he was Zopyros, and that he came as a deserter to\r\nthem. The gate-keepers accordingly when they heard this led him to the\r\npublic assembly of the Babylonians; and being introduced before it he\r\nbegan to lament his fortunes, saying that he had in fact suffered at his\r\nown hands, and that he had suffered this because he had counselled the\r\nking to withdraw his army, since in truth there seemed to be no means of\r\ntaking the town: \"And now,\" he went on to say, \"I am come for very great\r\ngood to you, O Babylonians, but for very great evil to Dareios and\r\nhis army, and to the Persians, 134 for he shall surely not escape with\r\nimpunity for having thus maltreated me; and I know all the courses of\r\nhis counsels.\"\r\n\r\n157. Thus he spoke, and the Babylonians, when they saw the man of most\r\nreputation among the Persians deprived of nose and ears and smeared over\r\nwith blood from scourging, supposing assuredly that he was speaking the\r\ntruth and had come to be their helper, were ready to put in his power\r\nthat for which he asked them, and he asked them that he might command\r\na certain force. Then when he had obtained this from them, he did that\r\nwhich he had agreed with Dareios that he would do; for he led out on\r\nthe tenth day the army of the Babylonians, and having surrounded the\r\nthousand men whom he had enjoined Dareios first to set there, he slew\r\nthem. The Babylonians accordingly, perceiving that the deeds which he\r\ndisplayed were in accordance with his words, were very greatly rejoiced\r\nand were ready to serve him in all things: and after the lapse of the\r\ndays which had been agreed upon, he again chose men of the Babylonians\r\nand led them out and slew the two thousand men of the troops of Dareios.\r\nSeeing this deed also, the Babylonians all had the name of Zopyros upon\r\ntheir tongues, and were loud in his praise. He then again, after the\r\nlapse of the days which had been agreed upon, led them out to the place\r\nappointed, and surrounded the four thousand and slew them. When this\r\nalso had been done, Zopyros was everything among the Babylonians, and he\r\nwas appointed both commander of their army and guardian of their walls.\r\n\r\n158. But when Dareios made an attack according to the agreement on every\r\nside of the wall, then Zopyros discovered all his craft: for while\r\nthe Babylonians, having gone up on the wall, were defending themselves\r\nagainst the attacks of the army of Dareios, Zopyros opened the gates\r\ncalled the gates of Kissia and of Belos, and let in the Persians within\r\nthe wall. And of the Babylonians those who saw that which was done fled\r\nto the temple of Zeus Belos, but those who did not see remained each in\r\nhis own appointed place, until at last they also learnt that they had\r\nbeen betrayed.\r\n\r\n159. Thus was Babylon conquered for the second time: and Dareios when he\r\nhad overcome the Babylonians, first took away the wall from round their\r\ncity and pulled down all the gates; for when Cyrus took Babylon before\r\nhim, he did neither of these things: and secondly Dareios impaled the\r\nleading men to the number of about three thousand, but to the rest of\r\nthe Babylonians he gave back their city to dwell in: and to provide that\r\nthe Babylonians should have wives, in order that their race might be\r\npropagated, Dareios did as follows (for their own wives, as has been\r\ndeclared at the beginning, the Babylonians had suffocated, in provident\r\ncare for their store of food):—he ordered the nations who dwelt round to\r\nbring women to Babylon, fixing a certain number for each nation, so that\r\nthe sum total of fifty thousand women was brought together, and from\r\nthese women the present Babylonians are descended.\r\n\r\n160. As for Zopyros, in the judgment of Dareios no one of the Persians\r\nsurpassed him in good service, either of those who came after or of\r\nthose who had gone before, excepting Cyrus alone; for to Cyrus no man of\r\nthe Persians ever yet ventured to compare himself: and Dareios is said\r\nto have declared often that he would rather that Zopyros were free\r\nfrom the injury than that he should have twenty Babylons added to his\r\npossession in addition to that one which he had. Moreover he gave him\r\ngreat honours; for not only did he give him every year those things\r\nwhich by the Persians are accounted the most honourable, but also he\r\ngranted him Babylon to rule free from tribute, so long as he should\r\nlive; and he added many other gifts. The son of this Zopyros was\r\nMegabyzos, who was made commander in Egypt against the Athenians and\r\ntheir allies; and the son of this Megabyzos was Zopyros, who went over\r\nto Athens as a deserter from the Persians.\r\n\r\n—————\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK III\r\n\r\n1 [ See ii. 1.]\r\n\r\n2 [ {'Amasin}.

THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED MELPOMENE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After Babylon had been taken, the march of Dareios himself 1 against\r\nthe Scythians took place: for now that Asia was flourishing in respect\r\nof population, and large sums were being gathered in as revenue, Dareios\r\nformed the desire to take vengeance upon the Scythians, because they\r\nhad first invaded the Median land and had overcome in fight those\r\nwho opposed them; and thus they had been the beginners of wrong. The\r\nScythians in truth, as I have before said, 2 had ruled over Upper Asia\r\n3 for eight-and-twenty years; for they had invaded Asia in their pursuit\r\nof the Kimmerians, and they had deposed 4 the Medes from their rule, who\r\nhad rule over Asia before the Scythians came. Now when the Scythians had\r\nbeen absent from their own land for eight-and-twenty years, as they were\r\nreturning to it after that interval of time, they were met by a contest\r\n5 not less severe than that which they had had with the Medes, since\r\nthey found an army of no mean size opposing them. For the wives of the\r\nScythians, because their husbands were absent from them for a long time,\r\nhad associated with the slaves.\r\n\r\n2. Now the Scythians put out the eyes of all their slaves because of the\r\nmilk which they drink; and they do as follows:—they take blow-pipes of\r\nbone just like flutes, and these they insert into the vagina of the mare\r\nand blow with their mouths, and others milk while they blow: and they\r\nsay that they do this because the veins of the mare are thus filled,\r\nbeing blown out, and so the udder is let down. When they had drawn the\r\nmilk they pour it into wooden vessels hollowed out, and they set the\r\nblind slaves in order about 6 the vessels and agitate the milk. Then\r\nthat which comes to the top they skim off, considering it the more\r\nvaluable part, whereas they esteem that which settles down to be less\r\ngood than the other. For this reason 7 the Scythians put out the eyes of\r\nall whom they catch; for they are not tillers of the soil but nomads.\r\n\r\n3. From these their slaves then, I say, and from their wives had been\r\nborn and bred up a generation of young men, who having learnt the manner\r\nof their birth set themselves to oppose the Scythians as they were\r\nreturning from the Medes. And first they cut off their land by digging\r\na broad trench extending from the Tauric mountains to the Maiotian\r\nlake, at the point where 8 this is broadest; then afterwards when the\r\nScythians attempted to invade the land, they took up a position against\r\nthem and fought; and as they fought many times, and the Scythians were\r\nnot able to get any advantage in the fighting, one of them said: \"What a\r\nthing is this that we are doing, Scythians! We are fighting against our\r\nown slaves, and we are not only becoming fewer in number ourselves by\r\nbeing slain in battle, but also we are killing them, and so we shall\r\nhave fewer to rule over in future. Now therefore to me it seems good\r\nthat we leave spears and bows and that each one take his horse-whip\r\nand so go up close to them: for so long as they saw us with arms in our\r\nhands, they thought themselves equal to us and of equal birth; but when\r\nthey shall see that we have whips instead of arms, they will perceive\r\nthat they are our slaves, and having acknowledged this they will not\r\nawait our onset.\"\r\n\r\n4. When they heard this, the Scythians proceeded to do that which he\r\nsaid, and the others being panic-stricken by that which was done forgot\r\ntheir fighting and fled. Thus the Scythians had ruled over Asia; and\r\nin such manner, when they were driven out again by the Medes, they had\r\nreturned to their own land. For this Dareios wished to take vengeance\r\nupon them, and was gathering together an army to go against them.\r\n\r\n5. Now the Scythians say that their nation is the youngest of all\r\nnations, and that this came to pass as follows:—The first man who ever\r\nexisted in this region, which then was desert, was one named Targitaos:\r\nand of this Targitaos they say, though I do not believe it for my part,\r\nhowever they say the parents were Zeus and the daughter of the river\r\nBorysthenes. Targitaos, they report, was produced from some such origin\r\nas this, and of him were begotten three sons, Lipoxaïs and Arpoxaïs\r\nand the youngest Colaxaïs. In the reign of these 9 there came down from\r\nheaven certain things wrought of gold, a plough, a yoke, a battle-axe,\r\n10 and a cup, and fell in the Scythian land: and first the eldest saw\r\nand came near them, desiring to take them, but the gold blazed with fire\r\nwhen he approached it: then when he had gone away from it, the second\r\napproached, and again it did the same thing. These then the gold\r\nrepelled by blazing with fire; but when the third and youngest came up\r\nto it, the flame was quenched, and he carried them to his own house.\r\nThe elder brothers then, acknowledging the significance of this thing,\r\ndelivered the whole of the kingly power to the youngest.\r\n\r\n6. From Lixopaïs, they say, are descended those Scythians who are called\r\nthe race of the Auchatai; from the middle brother Arpoxaïs those who are\r\ncalled Catiaroi and Traspians, and from the youngest of them the \"Royal\"\r\ntribe, 11 who are called Paralatai: and the whole together are called,\r\nthey say, Scolotoi, after the name of their king; 12 but the Hellenes\r\ngave them the name of Scythians.\r\n\r\n7. Thus the Scythians say they were produced; and from the time of their\r\norigin, that is to say from the first king Targitaos, to the passing\r\nover of Dareios against them, they say that there is a period of a\r\nthousand years and no more. Now this sacred gold is guarded by the\r\nkings with the utmost care, and they visit it every year with solemn\r\nsacrifices of propitiation: moreover if any one goes to sleep while\r\nwatching in the open air over this gold during the festival, the\r\nScythians say that he does not live out the year; and there is given him\r\nfor this so much land as he shall ride round himself on his horse in one\r\nday. Now as the land was large, Colaxaïs, they say, established three\r\nkingdoms for his sons; and of these he made one larger than the rest,\r\nand in this the gold is kept. But as to the upper parts which lie on the\r\nNorth side of those who dwell above this land, they say one can neither\r\nsee nor pass through any further by reason of feathers which are poured\r\ndown; for both the earth and the air are full of feathers, and this is\r\nthat which shuts off the view.\r\n\r\n8. Thus say the Scythians about themselves and about the region\r\nabove them; but the Hellenes who dwell about the Pontus say as\r\nfollows:—Heracles driving the cattle of Geryones came to this land, then\r\ndesert, which the Scythians now inhabit; and Geryones, says the tale,\r\ndwelt away from the region of the Pontus, living in the island called\r\nby the Hellenes Erytheia, near Gadeira which is outside the Pillars of\r\nHeracles by the Ocean.—As to the Ocean, they say indeed that it flows\r\nround the whole earth beginning from the place of the sunrising, but\r\nthey do not prove this by facts.—From thence Heracles came to the land\r\nnow called Scythia; and as a storm came upon him together with icy cold,\r\nhe drew over him his lion's skin and went to sleep. Meanwhile the mares\r\nharnessed in his chariot disappeared by a miraculous chance, as they\r\nwere feeding.\r\n\r\n9. Then when Heracles woke he sought for them; and having gone over the\r\nwhole land, at last he came to the region which is called Hylaia; and\r\nthere he found in a cave a kind of twofold creature formed by the union\r\nof a maiden and a serpent, whose upper parts from the buttocks upwards\r\nwere those of a woman, but her lower parts were those of a snake. Having\r\nseen her and marvelled at her, he asked her then whether she had seen\r\nany mares straying anywhere; and she said that she had them herself and\r\nwould not give them up until he lay with her; and Heracles lay with her\r\non condition of receiving them. She then tried to put off the giving\r\nback of the mares, desiring to have Heracles with her as long as\r\npossible, while he on the other hand desired to get the mares and\r\ndepart; and at last she gave them back and said: \"These mares when they\r\ncame hither I saved for thee, and thou didst give me reward for saving\r\nthem; for I have by thee three sons. Tell me then, what must I do with\r\nthese when they shall be grown to manhood, whether I shall settle them\r\nhere, for over this land I have power alone, or send them away to thee?\"\r\nShe thus asked of him, and he, they say, replied: \"When thou seest that\r\nthe boys are grown to men, do this and thou shalt not fail of doing\r\nright:—whichsoever of them thou seest able to stretch this bow as I do\r\nnow, and to be girded 1201 with this girdle, him cause to be the settler\r\nof this land; but whosoever of them fails in the deeds which I enjoin,\r\nsend him forth out of the land: and if thou shalt do thus, thou wilt\r\nboth have delight thyself and perform that which has been enjoined to\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\n10. Upon this he drew one of his bows (for up to that time Heracles,\r\nthey say, was wont to carry two) and showed her the girdle, and then he\r\ndelivered to her both the bow and the girdle, which had at the end of\r\nits clasp a golden cup; and having given them he departed. She then,\r\nwhen her sons had been born and had grown to be men, gave them names\r\nfirst, calling one of them Agathyrsos and the next Gelonos and the\r\nyoungest Skythes; then bearing in mind the charge given to her, she did\r\nthat which was enjoined. And two of her sons, Agathyrsos and Gelonos,\r\nnot having proved themselves able to attain to the task set before them,\r\ndeparted from the land, being cast out by her who bore them; but Skythes\r\nthe youngest of them performed the task and remained in the land:\r\nand from Skythes the son of Heracles were descended, they say, the\r\nsucceeding kings of the Scythians (Skythians): and they say moreover\r\nthat it is by reason of the cup that the Scythians still even to this\r\nday wear cups attached to their girdles: and this alone his mother\r\ncontrived for Skythes. 13 Such is the story told by the Hellenes who\r\ndwell about the Pontus.\r\n\r\n11. There is however also another story, which is as follows, and to\r\nthis I am most inclined myself. It is to the effect that the nomad\r\nScythians dwelling in Asia, being hard pressed in war by the Massagetai,\r\nleft their abode and crossing the river Araxes came towards the\r\nKimmerian land (for the land which now is occupied by the Scythians is\r\nsaid to have been in former times the land of the Kimmerians); and the\r\nKimmerians, when the Scythians were coming against them, took counsel\r\ntogether, seeing that a great host was coming to fight against them;\r\nand it proved that their opinions were divided, both opinions being\r\nvehemently maintained, but the better being that of their kings: for the\r\nopinion of the people was that it was necessary to depart and that they\r\nought not to run the risk of fighting against so many, 14 but that of\r\nthe kings was to fight for their land with those who came against them:\r\nand as neither the people were willing by means to agree to the counsel\r\nof the kings nor the kings to that of the people, the people planned\r\nto depart without fighting and to deliver up the land to the invaders,\r\nwhile the kings resolved to die and to be laid in their own land, and\r\nnot to flee with the mass of the people, considering the many goods of\r\nfortune which they had enjoyed, and the many evils which it might be\r\nsupposed would come upon them, if they fled from their native land.\r\nHaving resolved upon this, they parted into two bodies, and making their\r\nnumbers equal they fought with one another: and when these had all been\r\nkilled by one another's hands, then the people of the Kimmerians buried\r\nthem by the bank of the river Tyras (where their burial-place is still\r\nto be seen), and having buried them, then they made their way out\r\nfrom the land, and the Scythians when they came upon it found the land\r\ndeserted of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n12. And there are at the present time in the land of Scythia Kimmerian\r\nwalls, and a Kimmerian ferry; and there is also a region which is called\r\nKimmeria, and the so-called Kimmerian Bosphorus. It is known moreover\r\nthat the Kimmerians, in their flight to Asia from the Scythians, also\r\nmade a settlement on that peninsula on which now stands the Hellenic\r\ncity of Sinope; and it is known too that the Scythians pursued them\r\nand invaded the land of Media, having missed their way; for while the\r\nKimmerians kept ever along by the sea in their flight, the Scythians\r\npursued them keeping Caucasus on their right hand, until at last they\r\ninvaded Media, directing their course inland. This then which has been\r\ntold is another story, and it is common both to Hellenes and Barbarians.\r\n\r\n13. Aristeas however the son of Caÿstrobios, a man of Proconnesos,\r\nsaid in the verses which he composed, that he came to the land of the\r\nIssedonians being possessed by Phoebus, and that beyond the Issedonians\r\ndwelt Arimaspians, a one-eyed race, and beyond these the gold-guarding\r\ngriffins, and beyond them the Hyperboreans extending as far as the sea:\r\nand all these except the Hyperboreans, beginning with the Arimaspians,\r\nwere continually making war on their neighbours, and the Issedonians\r\nwere gradually driven out of their country by the Arimaspians and the\r\nScythians by the Issedonians, and so the Kimmerians, who dwelt on the\r\nSouthern Sea, being pressed by the Scythians left their land. Thus\r\nneither does he agree in regard to this land with the report of the\r\nScythians.\r\n\r\n14. As to Aristeas who composed 15 this, I have said already whence\r\nhe was; and I will tell also the tale which I heard about him in\r\nProconnesos and Kyzicos. They say that Aristeas, who was in birth\r\ninferior to none of the citizens, entered into a fuller's shop in\r\nProconnesos and there died; and the fuller closed his workshop and went\r\naway to report the matter to those who were related to the dead man. And\r\nwhen the news had been spread abroad about the city that Aristeas was\r\ndead, a man of Kyzicos who had come from the town of Artake entered into\r\ncontroversy with those who said so, and declared that he had met him\r\ngoing towards Kyzicos and had spoken with him: and while he was vehement\r\nin dispute, those who were related to the dead man came to the fuller's\r\nshop with the things proper in order to take up the corpse for burial;\r\nand when the house was opened, Aristeas was not found there either dead\r\nor alive. In the seventh year after this he appeared at Proconnesos\r\nand composed those verses which are now called by the Hellenes the\r\nArimaspeia, and having composed them he disappeared the second time.\r\n\r\n15. So much is told by these cities; and what follows I know happened\r\nto the people of Metapontion in Italy 16 two hundred 17 and forty\r\nyears after the second disappearance of Aristeas, as I found by putting\r\ntogether the evidence at Proconnesos and Metapontion. The people of\r\nMetapontion say that Aristeas himself appeared in their land and bade\r\nthem set up an altar of Apollo and place by its side a statue bearing\r\nthe name of Aristeas of Proconnesos; for he told them that to their\r\nland alone of all the Italiotes 18 Apollo had come, and he, who now was\r\nAristeas, was accompanying him, being then a raven when he accompanied\r\nthe god. Having said this he disappeared; and the Metapontines say that\r\nthey sent to Delphi and asked the god what the apparition of the man\r\nmeant: and the Pythian prophetess bade them obey the command of the\r\napparition, and told them that if they obeyed, it would be the better\r\nfor them. They therefore accepted this answer and performed the\r\ncommands; and there stands a statue now bearing the name of Aristeas\r\nclose by the side of the altar dedicated to Apollo, 19 and round it\r\nstand laurel trees; and the altar is set up in the market-place. Let\r\nthis suffice which has been said about Aristeas.\r\n\r\n16. Now of the land about which this account has been begun, no one\r\nknows precisely what lies beyond it: 20 for I am not able to hear of any\r\none who alleges that he knows as an eye-witness; and even Aristeas,\r\nthe man of whom I was making mention just now, even he, I say, did not\r\nallege, although he was composing verse, 21 that he went further than\r\nthe Issedonians; but that which is beyond them he spoke of by hearsay,\r\nand reported that it was the Issedonians who said these things. So far\r\nhowever as we were able to arrive at certainty by hearsay, carrying\r\ninquiries as far as possible, all this shall be told.\r\n\r\n17. Beginning with the trading station of the Borysthenites,—for of the\r\nparts along the sea this is the central point of all Scythia,—beginning\r\nwith this, the first regions are occupied by the Callipidai, who are\r\nHellenic Scythians; and above these is another race, who are called\r\nAlazonians. 22 These last and the Callipidai in all other respects have\r\nthe same customs as the Scythians, but they both sow corn and use it as\r\nfood, and also onions, leeks, lentils and millet. Above the Alazonians\r\ndwell Scythians who till the ground, and these sow their corn not for\r\nfood but to sell.\r\n\r\n18.Beyond them dwell the Neuroi; and beyond the Neuroi towards the North\r\nWind is a region without inhabitants, as far as we know. These races\r\nare along the river Hypanis to the West of the Borysthenes; but after\r\ncrossing the Borysthenes, first from the sea-coast is Hylaia, and beyond\r\nthis as one goes up the river dwell agricultural Scythians, whom the\r\nHellenes who live upon the river Hypanis call Borysthenites, calling\r\nthemselves at the same time citizens of Olbia. 23 These agricultural\r\nScythians occupy the region which extends Eastwards for a distance of\r\nthree days' journey, 24 reaching to a river which is called Panticapes,\r\nand Northwards for a distance of eleven days' sail up the Borysthenes.\r\nThen immediately beyond these begins the desert 25 and extends for\r\na great distance; and on the other side of the desert dwell the\r\nAndrophagoi, 26 a race apart by themselves and having no connection with\r\nthe Scythians. Beyond them begins a region which is really desert and\r\nhas no race of men in it, as far as we know.\r\n\r\n19. The region which lies to the East of these agricultural Scythians,\r\nafter one has crossed the river Panticapes, is occupied by nomad\r\nScythians, who neither sow anything nor plough the earth; and this whole\r\nregion is bare of trees except Hylaia. These nomads occupy a country\r\nwhich extends to the river Gerros, a distance of fourteen 27 days'\r\njourney Eastwards.\r\n\r\n20. Then on the other side of the Gerros we have those parts which are\r\ncalled the \"Royal\" lands and those Scythians who are the bravest and\r\nmost numerous and who esteem the other Scythians their slaves. These\r\nreach Southwards to the Tauric land, and Eastwards to the trench which\r\nthose who were begotten of the blind slaves dug, and to the trading\r\nstation which is called Cremnoi 28 upon the Maiotian lake; and some\r\nparts of their country reach to the river Tanaïs. Beyond the Royal\r\nScythians towards the North Wind dwell the Melanchlainoi, 29 of a\r\ndifferent race and not Scythian. The region beyond the Melanchlainoi is\r\nmarshy and not inhabited by any, so far as we know.\r\n\r\n21. After one has crossed the river Tanaïs the country is no longer\r\nScythia, but the first of the divisions belongs to the Sauromatai,\r\nwho beginning at the corner of the Maiotian lake occupy land extending\r\ntowards the North Wind fifteen days' journey, and wholly bare of trees\r\nboth cultivated and wild. Above these, holding the next division of\r\nland, dwell the Budinoi, who occupy a land wholly overgrown with forest\r\nconsisting of all kinds of trees.\r\n\r\n22. Then beyond the Budinoi towards the North, first there is desert for\r\nseven days' journey; and after the desert turning aside somewhat more\r\ntowards the East Wind we come to land occupied by the Thyssagetai, a\r\nnumerous people and of separate race from the others. These live by\r\nhunting; and bordering upon them there are settled also in these same\r\nregions men who are called Irycai, who also live by hunting, which they\r\npractise in the following manner:—the hunter climbs up a tree and lies\r\nin wait there for his game (now trees are abundant in all this country),\r\nand each has a horse at hand, which has been taught to lie down upon its\r\nbelly in order that it may make itself low, and also a dog: and when he\r\nsees the wild animal from the tree, he first shoots his arrow and then\r\nmounts upon his horse and pursues it, and the dog seizes hold of it.\r\nAbove these in a direction towards the East dwell other Scythians, who\r\nhave revolted from the Royal Scythians and so have come to this region.\r\n\r\n23. As far as the country of these Scythians the whole land which has\r\nbeen described is level plain and has a deep soil; but after this point\r\nit is stony and rugged. Then when one has passed through a great extent\r\nof this rugged country, there dwell in the skirts of lofty mountains\r\nmen who are said to be all bald-headed from their birth, male and female\r\nequally, and who have flat noses and large chins and speak a language of\r\ntheir own, using the Scythian manner of dress, and living on the produce\r\nof trees. The tree on the fruit of which they live is called the Pontic\r\ntree, and it is about the size of a fig-tree: this bears a fruit the\r\nsize of a bean, containing a stone. When the fruit has ripened, they\r\nstrain it through cloths and there flows from it a thick black juice,\r\nand this juice which flows from it is called as-chy. This they either\r\nlick up or drink mixed with milk, and from its lees, that is the solid\r\npart, they make cakes and use them for food; for they have not many\r\ncattle, since the pastures there are by no means good. Each man has his\r\ndwelling under a tree, in winter covering the tree all round with close\r\nwhite felt-cloth, and in summer without it. These are injured by no men,\r\nfor they are said to be sacred, and they possess no weapon of war. These\r\nare they also who decide the disputes rising among their neighbours; and\r\nbesides this, whatever fugitive takes refuge with them is injured by no\r\none: and they are called Argippaians. 30\r\n\r\n24. Now as far as these bald-headed men there is abundantly clear\r\ninformation about the land and about the nations on this side of them;\r\nfor not only do certain of the Scythians go to them, from whom it is not\r\ndifficult to get information, but also some of the Hellenes who are at\r\nthe trading-station of the Borysthenes and the other trading-places of\r\nthe Pontic coast: and those of the Scythians who go to them transact\r\ntheir business through seven interpreters and in seven different\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n25. So far as these, I say, the land is known; but concerning the region\r\nto the North of the bald-headed men no one can speak with certainty,\r\nfor lofty and impassable mountains divide it off, and no one passes over\r\nthem. However these bald-headed men say (though I do not believe it)\r\nthat the mountains are inhabited by men with goats' feet; and that after\r\none has passed beyond these, others are found who sleep through six\r\nmonths of the year. This I do not admit at all as true. However, the\r\ncountry to the East of the bald-headed men is known with certainty,\r\nbeing inhabited by the Issedonians, but that which lies beyond both the\r\nbald-headed men and the Issedonians towards the North Wind is unknown,\r\nexcept so far as we know it from the accounts given by these nations\r\nwhich have just been mentioned.\r\n\r\n26. The Issedonians are said to have these customs:—when a man's father\r\nis dead, all the relations bring cattle to the house, and then having\r\nslain them and cut up the flesh, they cut up also the dead body of the\r\nfather of their entertainer, and mixing all the flesh together they set\r\nforth a banquet. His skull however they strip of the flesh and clean it\r\nout and then gild it over, and after that they deal with it as a sacred\r\nthing 31 and perform for the dead man great sacrifices every year.\r\nThis each son does for his father, just as the Hellenes keep the day of\r\nmemorial for the dead. 32 In other respects however this race also is\r\nsaid to live righteously, and their women have equal rights with the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n27. These then also are known; but as to the region beyond them, it\r\nis the Issedonians who report that there are there one-eyed men and\r\ngold-guarding griffins; and the Scythians report this having received it\r\nfrom them, and from the Scythians we, that is the rest of mankind, have\r\ngot our belief; and we call them in Scythian language Arimaspians, for\r\nthe Scythians call the number one arima and the eye spu.\r\n\r\n28. This whole land which has been described is so exceedingly severe in\r\nclimate, that for eight months of the year there is frost so hard as to\r\nbe intolerable; and during these if you pour out water you will not be\r\nable to make mud, but only if you kindle a fire can you make it; and\r\nthe sea is frozen and the whole of the Kimmerian Bosphorus, so that the\r\nScythians who are settled within the trench make expeditions and drive\r\ntheir waggons over into the country of the Sindians. Thus it continues\r\nto be winter for eight months, and even for the remaining four it is\r\ncold in those parts. This winter is distinguished in its character from\r\nall the winters which come in other parts of the world; for in it there\r\nis no rain to speak of at the usual season for rain, whereas in summer\r\nit rains continually; and thunder does not come at the time when it\r\ncomes in other countries, but is very frequent, 33 in the summer; and if\r\nthunder comes in winter, it is marvelled at as a prodigy: just so, if\r\nan earthquake happens, whether in summer or in winter, it is accounted\r\na prodigy in Scythia. Horses are able to endure this winter, but neither\r\nmules nor asses can endure it at all, whereas in other countries horses\r\nif they stand in frost lose their limbs by mortification, while asses\r\nand mules endure it.\r\n\r\n29. I think also that it is for this reason that the hornless breed\r\nof oxen in that country have no horns growing; and there is a verse of\r\nHomer in the Odyssey 34 supporting my opinion, which runs this:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Also the Libyan land, where the sheep very quickly grow hornèd,\"\r\n\r\nfor it is rightly said that in hot regions the horns come quickly,\r\nwhereas in extreme cold the animals either have no horns growing at all,\r\nor hardly any. 35\r\n\r\n30. In that land then this takes place on account of the cold; but\r\n(since my history proceeded from the first seeking occasions for\r\ndigression) 36 I feel wonder that in the whole land of Elis mules cannot\r\nbe bred, though that region is not cold, nor is there any other evident\r\ncause. The Eleians themselves say that in consequence of some curse\r\nmules are not begotten in their land; but when the time approaches for\r\nthe mares to conceive, they drive them out into the neighbouring\r\nlands and there in the land of their neighbours they admit to them the\r\nhe-asses until the mares are pregnant, and then they drive them back.\r\n\r\n31. As to the feathers of which the Scythians say that the air is full,\r\nand that by reason of them they are not able either to see or to pass\r\nthrough the further parts of the continent, the opinion which I have is\r\nthis:—in the parts beyond this land it snows continually, though less\r\nin summer than in winter, as might be supposed. Now whomsoever has seen\r\nclose at hand snow falling thickly, knows what I mean without further\r\nexplanation, for the snow is like feathers: and on account of this\r\nwintry weather, being such as I have said, the Northern parts of this\r\ncontinent are uninhabitable. I think therefore that by the feathers the\r\nScythians and those who dwell near them mean symbolically the snow. This\r\nthen which has been said goes to the furthest extent of the accounts\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n32. About a Hyperborean people the Scythians report nothing, nor do any\r\nof those who dwell in this region, unless it be the Issedonians: but\r\nin my opinion neither do these report anything; for if they did the\r\nScythians also would report it, as they do about the one-eyed people.\r\nHesiod however has spoken of Hyperboreans, and so also has Homer in the\r\npoem of the \"Epigonoi,\" at least if Homer was really the composer of\r\nthat Epic.\r\n\r\n33. But much more about them is reported by the people of Delos than by\r\nany others. For these say that sacred offerings bound up in wheat straw\r\nare carried from the land of the Hyperboreans and come to the Scythians,\r\nand then from the Scythians the neighbouring nations in succession\r\nreceive them and convey them Westwards, finally as far as the Adriatic:\r\nthence they are sent forward towards the South, and the people of Dodona\r\nreceive them first of all the Hellenes, and from these they come down to\r\nthe Malian gulf and are passed over to Euboea, where city sends them on\r\nto city till they come to Carystos. After this Andros is left out, for\r\nthe Carystians are those who bring them to Tenos, and the Tenians to\r\nDelos. Thus they say that these sacred offerings come to Delos; but at\r\nfirst, they say, the Hyperboreans sent two maidens bearing the sacred\r\nofferings, whose names, say the Delians, were Hyperoche and Laodike, and\r\nwith them for their protection the Hyperboreans sent five men of their\r\nnation to attend them, those namely who are now called Perphereës and\r\nhave great honours paid to them in Delos. Since however the Hyperboreans\r\nfound that those who were sent away did not return back, they were\r\ntroubled to think that it would always befall them to send out and not\r\nto receive back; and so they bore the offerings to the borders of their\r\nland bound up in wheat straw, and laid a charge upon their neighbours,\r\nbidding them send these forward from themselves to another nation. These\r\nthings then, they say, come to Delos being thus sent forward; and I know\r\nof my own knowledge that a thing is done which has resemblance to\r\nthese offerings, namely that the women of Thrace and Paionia, when they\r\nsacrifice to Artemis \"the Queen,\" do not make their offerings without\r\nwheat straw.\r\n\r\n34. These I know do as I have said; and for those maidens from the\r\nHyperboreans, who died in Delos, both the girls and the boys of the\r\nDelians cut off their hair: the former before marriage cut off a lock\r\nand having wound it round a spindle lay it upon the tomb (now the tomb\r\nis on the left hand as one goes into the temple of Artemis, and over it\r\ngrows an olive-tree), and all the boys of the Delians wind some of their\r\nhair about a green shoot of some tree, and they also place it upon the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\n35. The maidens, I say, have this honour paid them by the dwellers in\r\nDelos: and the same people say that Arge and Opis also, being maidens,\r\ncame to Delos, passing from the Hyperboreans by the same nations which\r\nhave been mentioned, even before Hyperoche and Laodike. These last, they\r\nsay, came bearing for Eileithuia the tribute which they had laid upon\r\nthemselves for the speedy birth, 37 but Arge and Opis came with the\r\ndivinities themselves, and other honours have been assigned to them by\r\nthe people of Delos: for the women, they say, collect for them, naming\r\nthem by their names in the hymn which Olen a man of Lykia composed in\r\ntheir honour; and both the natives of the other islands and the\r\nIonians have learnt from them to sing hymns naming Opis and Arge and\r\ncollecting:—now this Olen came from Lukia and composed also the other\r\nancient hymns which are sung in Delos:—and moreover they say that when\r\nthe thighs of the victim are consumed upon the altar, the ashes of them\r\nare used to cast upon the grave of Opis and Arge. Now their grave is\r\nbehind the temple of Artemis, turned towards the East, close to the\r\nbanqueting hall of the Keïeans.\r\n\r\n36. Let this suffice which has been said of the Hyperboreans; for the\r\ntale of Abaris, who is reported to have been a Hyperborean, I do not\r\ntell, namely 3701 how he carried the arrow about all over the earth,\r\neating no food. If however there are any Hyperboreans, it follows that\r\nthere are also Hypernotians; and I laugh when I see that, though many\r\nbefore this have drawn maps of the Earth, yet no one has set the matter\r\nforth in an intelligent way; seeing that they draw Ocean flowing round\r\nthe Earth, which is circular exactly as if drawn with compasses, and\r\nthey make Asia equal in size to Europe. In a few words I shall declare\r\nthe size of each division and of what nature it is as regards outline.\r\n\r\n37. The Persians inhabit Asia 38 extending to the Southern Sea, which is\r\ncalled the Erythraian; and above these towards the North Wind dwell the\r\nMedes, and above the Medes the Saspeirians, and above the Saspeirians\r\nthe Colchians, extending to the Northern Sea, into which the river\r\nPhasis runs. These four nations inhabit from sea to sea.\r\n\r\n38. From them Westwards two peninsulas 39 stretch out from Asia into the\r\nsea, and these I will describe. The first peninsula on the one of its\r\nsides, that is the Northern, stretches along beginning from the Phasis\r\nand extending to the sea, going along the Pontus and the Hellespont as\r\nfar as Sigeion in the land of Troy; and on the Southern side the same\r\npeninsula stretches from the Myriandrian gulf, which lies near Phenicia,\r\nin the direction of the sea as far as the headland Triopion; and in this\r\npeninsula dwell thirty races of men.\r\n\r\n39. This then is one of the peninsulas, and the other beginning from the\r\nland of the Persians stretches along to the Erythraian Sea, including\r\nPersia and next after it Assyria, and Arabia after Assyria: and this\r\nends, or rather is commonly supposed to end, 40 at the Arabian gulf,\r\ninto which Dareios conducted a channel from the Nile. Now in the line\r\nstretching to Phenicia from the land of the Persians the land is broad\r\nand the space abundant, but after Phenicia this peninsula goes by the\r\nshore of our Sea along Palestine, Syria, and Egypt, where it ends; and\r\nin it there are three nations only.\r\n\r\n40. These are the parts of Asia which tend towards the West from the\r\nPersian land; but as to those which lie beyond the Persians and Medes\r\nand Saspeirians and Colchians towards the East and the sunrising, on one\r\nside the Erythraian Sea runs along by them, and on the North both the\r\nCaspian Sea and the river Araxes, which flows towards the rising sun:\r\nand Asia is inhabited as far as the Indian land; but from this onwards\r\ntowards the East it becomes desert, nor can any one say what manner of\r\nland it is.\r\n\r\n41. Such and so large is Asia: and Libya is included in the second\r\npeninsula; for after Egypt Libya succeeds at once. Now about Egypt\r\nthis peninsula is narrow, for from our Sea to the Erythraian Sea is a\r\ndistance there of ten myriads of fathoms, 41 which would amount to\r\na thousand furlongs; but after this narrow part, the portion of the\r\npeninsula which is called Libya is, as it chances, extremely broad.\r\n\r\n42. I wonder then at those who have parted off and divided the world\r\ninto Libya, Asia, and Europe, since the difference between these is not\r\nsmall; for in length Europe extends along by both, while in breadth\r\nit is clear to me that it is beyond comparison larger; 42 for Libya\r\nfurnishes proofs about itself that it is surrounded by sea, except so\r\nmuch of it as borders upon Asia; and this fact was shown by Necos king\r\nof the Egyptians first of all those about whom we have knowledge. He\r\nwhen he had ceased digging the channel 43 which goes through from the\r\nNile to the Arabian gulf, sent Phenicians with ships, bidding them sail\r\nand come back through the Pillars of Heracles to the Northern Sea and so\r\nto Egypt. The Phenicians therefore set forth from the Erythraian Sea and\r\nsailed through the Southern Sea; and when autumn came, they would put\r\nto shore and sow the land, wherever in Libya they might happen to be as\r\nthey sailed, and then they waited for the harvest: and having reaped\r\nthe corn they would sail on, so that after two years had elapsed, in the\r\nthird year they turned through the Pillars of Heracles and arrived again\r\nin Egypt. And they reported a thing which I cannot believe, but another\r\nman may, namely that in sailing round Libya they had the sun on their\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n43. Thus was this country first known to be what it is, and after this\r\nit is the Carthaginians who make report of it; for as to Sataspes the\r\nson of Teaspis the Achaimenid, he did not sail round Libya, though he\r\nwas sent for this very purpose, but was struck with fear by the length\r\nof the voyage and the desolate nature of the land, and so returned back\r\nand did not accomplish the task which his mother laid upon him. For this\r\nman had outraged a daughter of Zopyros the son of Megabyzos, a virgin;\r\nand then when he was about to be impaled by order of king Xerxes for\r\nthis offence, the mother of Sataspes, who was a sister of Dareios,\r\nentreated for his life, saying that she would herself lay upon him a\r\ngreater penalty than Xerxes; for he should be compelled (she said) to\r\nsail round Libya, until in sailing round it he came to the Arabian gulf.\r\nSo then Xerxes having agreed upon these terms, Sataspes went to Egypt,\r\nand obtaining a ship and sailors from the Egyptians, he sailed to the\r\nPillars of Heracles; and having sailed through them and turned the point\r\nof Libya which is called the promontory of Soloeis, he sailed on towards\r\nthe South. Then after he had passed over much sea in many months, as\r\nthere was needed ever more and more voyaging, he turned about and sailed\r\nback again to Egypt: and having come from thence into the presence of\r\nking Xerxes, he reported saying that at the furthest point which he\r\nreached he was sailing by dwarfish people, who used clothing made from\r\nthe palm-tree, and who, whenever they came to land with their ship, left\r\ntheir towns and fled away to the mountains: and they, he said, did no\r\ninjury when they entered into the towns, but took food 4301 from them\r\nonly. And the cause, he said, why he had not completely sailed round\r\nLibya was that the ship could not advance any further but stuck fast.\r\nXerxes however did not believe that he was speaking the truth, and since\r\nhe had not performed the appointed task, he impaled him, inflicting upon\r\nhim the penalty pronounced before. A eunuch belonging to this Sataspes\r\nran away to Samos as soon as he heard that his master was dead,\r\ncarrying with him large sums of money; and of this a man of Samos took\r\npossession, whose name I know, but I purposely pass it over without\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n44. Of Asia the greater part was explored by Dareios, who desiring to\r\nknow of the river Indus, which is a second river producing crocodiles of\r\nall the rivers in the world,—to know, I say, of this river where it runs\r\nout into the sea, sent with ships, besides others whom he trusted to\r\nspeak the truth, Skylax also, a man of Caryanda. These starting from\r\nthe city of Caspatyros and the land of Pactyïke, sailed down the river\r\ntowards the East and the sunrising to the sea; and then sailing over the\r\nsea Westwards they came in the thirtieth month to that place from whence\r\nthe king of the Egyptians had sent out the Phenicians of whom I spoke\r\nbefore, to sail round Libya. After these had made their voyage round the\r\ncoast, Dareios both subdued the Indians and made use of this sea. Thus\r\nAsia also, excepting the parts of it which are towards the rising sun,\r\nhas been found to be similar 44 to Libya.\r\n\r\n45. As to Europe, however, it is clearly not known by any, either as\r\nregards the parts which are towards the rising sun or those towards the\r\nNorth, whether it be surrounded by sea: but in length it is known\r\nto stretch along by both the other divisions. And I am not able to\r\nunderstand for what reason it is that to the Earth, which is one, three\r\ndifferent names are given derived from women, and why there were set\r\nas boundaries to divide it the river Nile of Egypt and the Phasis in\r\nColchis (or as some say the Maiotian river Tanaïs and the Kimmerian\r\nferry); nor can I learn who those persons were who made the boundaries,\r\nor for what reason they gave the names. Libya indeed is said by most of\r\nthe Hellenes to have its name from Libya a woman of that country, and\r\nAsia from the wife of Prometheus: but this last name is claimed by the\r\nLydians, who say that Asia has been called after Asias the son of Cotys\r\nthe son of Manes, and not from Asia the wife of Prometheus; and from\r\nhim too they say the Asian tribe in Sardis has its name. As to Europe\r\nhowever, it is neither known by any man whether it is surrounded by sea,\r\nnor does it appear whence it got this name or who he was who gave it,\r\nunless we shall say that the land received its name from Europa the\r\nTyrian; and if so, it would appear that before this it was nameless like\r\nthe rest. She however evidently belongs to Asia and did not come to this\r\nland which is now called by the Hellenes Europe, but only from Phenicia\r\nto Crete, and from Crete to Lykia. Let this suffice now which has been\r\nsaid about these matters; for we will adopt those which are commonly\r\naccepted of the accounts.\r\n\r\n46. Now the region of the Euxine upon which Dareios was preparing to\r\nmarch has, apart from the Scythian race, the most ignorant nations\r\nwithin it of all lands: for we can neither put forward any nation of\r\nthose who dwell within the region of Pontus as eminent in ability, nor\r\ndo we know of any man of learning 45 having arisen there, apart from the\r\nScythian nation and Anacharsis. By the Scythian race one thing which is\r\nthe most important of all human things has been found out more cleverly\r\nthan by any other men of whom we know; but in other respects I have no\r\ngreat admiration for them: and that most important thing which they have\r\ndiscovered is such that none can escape again who has come to attack\r\nthem, and if they do not desire to be found, it is not possible to catch\r\nthem: for they who have neither cities founded nor walls built, but all\r\ncarry their houses with them and are mounted archers, living not by the\r\nplough but by cattle, and whose dwellings are upon cars, these assuredly\r\nare invincible and impossible to approach.\r\n\r\n47. This they have found out, seeing that their land is suitable to it\r\nand at the same time the rivers are their allies: for first this land\r\nis plain land and is grassy and well watered, and then there are rivers\r\nflowing through it not much less in number than the channels in Egypt.\r\nOf these as many as are noteworthy and also can be navigated from the\r\nsea, I will name: there is Ister with five mouths, and after this Tyras,\r\nHypanis, Borysthenes, Panticapes, Kypakyris, Gerros and Tanaïs. These\r\nflow as I shall now describe.\r\n\r\n48. The Ister, which is the greatest of all the rivers which we know,\r\nflows always with equal volume in summer and winter alike. It is the\r\nfirst towards the West of all the Scythian rivers, and it has become the\r\ngreatest of all rivers because other rivers flow into it. And these\r\nare they which make it great: 46—five in number are those 47 which flow\r\nthrough the Scythian land, namely that which the Scythians call Porata\r\nand the Hellenes Pyretos, and besides this, Tiarantos and Araros and\r\nNaparis and Ordessos. The first-mentioned of these is a great river\r\nlying towards the East, and there it joins waters with the Ister, the\r\nsecond Tiarantos is more to the West and smaller, and the Araros and\r\nNaparis and Ordessos flow into the Ister going between these two.\r\n\r\n49. These are the native Scythian rivers which join to swell its stream,\r\nwhile from the Agathyrsians flows the Maris and joins the Ister, and\r\nfrom the summits of Haimos flow three other great rivers towards the\r\nNorth Wind and fall into it, namely Atlas and Auras and Tibisis. Through\r\nThrace and the Thracian Crobyzians flow the rivers Athrys and Noes\r\nand Artanes, running into the Ister; and from the Paionians and Mount\r\nRhodope the river Kios, 48 cutting through Haimos in the midst, runs\r\ninto it also. From the Illyrians the river Angros flows Northwards and\r\nruns out into the Triballian plain and into the river Brongos, and the\r\nBrongos flows into the Ister; thus the Ister receives both these, being\r\ngreat rivers. From the region which is above the Ombricans, the river\r\nCarpis and another river, the Alpis, flow also towards the North Wind\r\nand run into it; for the Ister flows in fact through the whole of\r\nEurope, beginning in the land of the Keltoi, who after the Kynesians\r\ndwell furthest towards the sun-setting of all the peoples of Europe;\r\nand thus flowing through all Europe it falls into the sea by the side of\r\nScythia.\r\n\r\n50. So then it is because these which have been named and many others\r\njoin their waters together, that Ister becomes the greatest of rivers;\r\nsince if we compare the single streams, the Nile is superior in volume\r\nof water; for into this no river or spring flows, to contribute to its\r\nvolume. And the Ister flows at an equal level always both in summer and\r\nin winter for some such cause as this, as I suppose:—in winter it is\r\nof the natural size, or becomes only a little larger than its nature,\r\nseeing that this land receives very little rain in winter, but\r\nconstantly has snow; whereas in summer the snow which fell in the\r\nwinter, in quantity abundant, melts and runs from all parts into the\r\nIster. This snow of which I speak, running into the river helps to swell\r\nits volume, and with it also many and violent showers of rain, for it\r\nrains during the summer: and thus the waters which mingle with the Ister\r\nare more copious in summer than they are in winter by about as much as\r\nthe water which the Sun draws to himself in summer exceeds that which he\r\ndraws in winter; and by the setting of these things against one another\r\nthere is produced a balance; so that the river is seen to be of equal\r\nvolume always.\r\n\r\n51. One, I say, of the rivers which the Scythians have is the Ister; and\r\nafter it the Tyras, which starts from the North and begins its course\r\nfrom a large lake which is the boundary between the land of the\r\nScythians and that of the Neuroi. At its mouth are settled those\r\nHellenes who are called Tyritai.\r\n\r\n52. The third river is the Hypanis, which starts from Scythia and flows\r\nfrom a great lake round which feed white wild horses; and this lake is\r\nrightly called \"Mother of Hypanis.\" From this then the river Hypanis\r\ntakes its rise and for a distance of five days' sail it flows shallow\r\nand with sweet water still; 49 but from this point on towards the sea\r\nfor four days' sail it is very bitter, for there flows into it the water\r\nof a bitter spring, which is so exceedingly bitter that, small as it is,\r\nit changes the water of the Hypanis by mingling with it, though that\r\nis a river to which few are equal in greatness. This spring is on\r\nthe border between the lands of the agricultural Scythians and of the\r\nAlazonians, and the name of the spring and of the place from which it\r\nflows is in Scythian Exampaios, and in the Hellenic tongue Hierai Hodoi.\r\n50 Now the Tyras and the Hypanis approach one another in their windings\r\nin the land of the Alazonians, but after this each turns off and widens\r\nthe space between them as they flow.\r\n\r\n53. Fourth is the river Borysthenes, which is both the largest of these\r\nafter the Ister, and also in our opinion the most serviceable not only\r\nof the Scythian rivers but also of all the rivers of the world besides,\r\nexcepting only the Nile of Egypt, for to this it is not possible to\r\ncompare any other river: of the rest however the Borysthenes is the most\r\nserviceable, seeing that it provides both pastures which are the fairest\r\nand the richest for cattle, and fish which are better by far and more\r\nnumerous than those of any other river, and also it is the sweetest\r\nwater to drink, and flows with clear stream, though others beside it are\r\nturbid, and along its banks crops are produced better than elsewhere,\r\nwhile in parts where it is not sown, grass grows deeper. Moreover at its\r\nmouth salt forms of itself in abundance, and it produces also huge fish\r\nwithout spines, which they call antacaioi, to be used for salting, and\r\nmany other things also worthy of wonder. Now as far as the region of the\r\nGerrians, 51 to which it is a voyage of forty 52 days, the Borysthenes\r\nis known as flowing from the North Wind; but above this none can tell\r\nthrough what nations it flows: it is certain however that it runs\r\nthrough desert 53 to the land of the agricultural Scythians; for these\r\nScythians dwell along its banks for a distance of ten days' sail. Of\r\nthis river alone and of the Nile I cannot tell where the sources are,\r\nnor, I think, can any of the Hellenes. When the Borysthenes comes near\r\nthe sea in its course, the Hypanis mingles with it, running out into the\r\nsame marsh; 5301 and the space between these two rivers, which is as it\r\nwere a beak of land, 54 is called the point of Hippoles, and in it is\r\nplaced a temple of the Mother, 55 and opposite the temple upon the river\r\nHypanis are settled the Borysthenites.\r\n\r\n54. This is that which has to do with these rivers; and after these\r\nthere is a fifth river besides, called Panticapes. This also flows 56\r\nboth from the North and from a lake, and in the space between this river\r\nand the Borysthenes dwell the agricultural Scythians: it runs out into\r\nthe region of Hylaia, and having passed by this it mingles with the\r\nBorysthenes.\r\n\r\n55. Sixth comes the river Hypakyris, which starts from a lake, and\r\nflowing through the midst of the nomad Scythians runs out into the sea\r\nby the city of Carkinitis, skirting on its right bank the region of\r\nHylaia and the so-called racecourse of Achilles.\r\n\r\n56. Seventh is the Gerros, which parts off from the Borysthenes near\r\nabout that part of the country where the Borysthenes ceases to be\r\nknown,—it parts off, I say, in this region and has the same name which\r\nthis region itself has, namely Gerros; and as it flows to the sea it\r\nborders the country of the nomad and that of the Royal Scythians, and\r\nruns out into the Hypakyris.\r\n\r\n57. The eighth is the river Tanaïs, which starts in its flow at first\r\nfrom a large lake, and runs out into a still larger lake called Maiotis,\r\nwhich is the boundary between the Royal Scythians and the Sauromatai.\r\nInto this Tanaïs falls another river, whose name is Hyrgis.\r\n\r\n58. So many are the rivers of note with which the Scythians are\r\nprovided: and for cattle the grass which comes up in the land of Scythia\r\nis the most productive of bile of any grass which we know; and that this\r\nis so you may judge when you open the bodies of the cattle.\r\n\r\n59. Thus abundant supply have they of that which is most important;\r\nand as for the rest their customs are as follows. The gods whom they\r\npropitiate by worship are these only:—Hestia most of all, then Zeus and\r\nthe Earth, supposing that Earth is the wife of Zeus, and after these\r\nApollo, and Aphrodite Urania, and Heracles, and Ares. Of these all\r\nthe Scythians have the worship established, and the so-called Royal\r\nScythians sacrifice also to Poseidon. Now Hestia is called in Scythian\r\nTabiti, and Zeus, being most rightly named in my opinion, is called\r\nPapaios, and Earth Api, 57 and Apollo Oitosyros, 58 and Aphrodite Urania\r\nis called Argimpasa, 59 and Poseidon Thagimasidas. 60 It is not their\r\ncustom however to make images, altars or temples to any except Ares, but\r\nto him it is their custom to make them.\r\n\r\n60. They have all the same manner of sacrifice established for all their\r\nreligious rites equally, and it is thus performed:—the victim stands\r\nwith its fore-feet tied, and the sacrificing priest stands behind the\r\nvictim, and by pulling the end of the cord he throws the beast down; and\r\nas the victim falls, he calls upon the god to whom he is sacrificing,\r\nand then at once throws a noose round its neck, and putting a small\r\nstick into it he turns it round and so strangles the animal, without\r\neither lighting a fire or making any first offering from the victim or\r\npouring any libation over it: and when he has strangled it and flayed\r\noff the skin, he proceeds to boil it.\r\n\r\n61. Now as the land of Scythia is exceedingly ill wooded, this\r\ncontrivance has been invented for the boiling of the flesh:—having\r\nflayed the victims, they strip the flesh off the bones and then put it\r\ninto caldrons, if they happen to have any, of native make, which\r\nvery much resemble Lesbian mixing-bowls except that they are much\r\nlarger,—into these they put the flesh and boil it by lighting under it\r\nthe bones of the victim: if however thy have not at hand the caldron,\r\nthey put all the flesh into the stomachs of the victims and adding water\r\nthey light the bones under them; and these blaze up beautifully, and the\r\nstomachs easily hold the flesh when it has been stripped off the bones:\r\nthus an ox is made to boil itself, and the other kinds of victims each\r\nboil themselves also. Then when the flesh is boiled, the sacrificer\r\ntakes a first offering of the flesh and of the vital organs and casts\r\nit in front of him. And they sacrifice various kinds of cattle, but\r\nespecially horses.\r\n\r\n62. To the others of the gods they sacrifice thus and these kinds\r\nof beasts, but to Ares as follows:—In each district of the several\r\ngovernments 61 they have a temple of Ares set up in this way:—bundles\r\nof brushwood are heaped up for about three furlongs 62 in length and\r\nin breadth, but less in height; and on the top of this there is a level\r\nsquare made, and three of the sides rise sheer but by the remaining one\r\nside the pile may be ascended. Every year they pile on a hundred and\r\nfifty waggon-loads of brushwood, for it is constantly settling down by\r\nreason of the weather. 63 Upon this pile of which I speak each people\r\nhas an ancient iron sword 64 set up, and this is the sacred symbol 65 of\r\nAres. To this sword they bring yearly offerings of cattle and of horses;\r\nand they have the following sacrifice in addition, beyond what they make\r\nto the other gods, that is to say, of all the enemies whom they take\r\ncaptive in war they sacrifice one man in every hundred, not in the same\r\nmanner as they sacrifice cattle, but in a different manner: for they\r\nfirst pour wine over their heads, and after that they cut the throats of\r\nthe men, so that the blood runs into a bowl; and then they carry this up\r\nto the top of the pile of brushwood and pour the blood over the sword.\r\nThis, I say, they carry up; and meanwhile below by the side of the\r\ntemple they are doing thus:—they cut off all the right arms of the\r\nslaughtered men with the hands and throw them up into the air, and then\r\nwhen they have finished offering the other victims, they go away; and\r\nthe arm lies wheresoever it has chanced to fall, and the corpse apart\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n63. Such are the sacrifices which are established among them; but of\r\nswine these make no use, nor indeed are they wont to keep them at all in\r\ntheir land.\r\n\r\n64. That which relates to war is thus ordered with them:—When a Scythian\r\nhas slain his first man, he drinks some of his blood: and of all those\r\nwhom he slays in the battle he bears the heads to the king; for if he\r\nhas brought a head he shares in the spoil which they have taken, but\r\notherwise not. And he takes off the skin of the head by cutting it round\r\nabout the ears and then taking hold of the scalp and shaking it off;\r\nafterwards he scrapes off the flesh with the rib of an ox, and works the\r\nskin about with his hands; and when he has thus tempered it, he keeps it\r\nas a napkin to wipe the hands upon, and hangs it from the bridle of the\r\nhorse on which he himself rides, and takes pride in it; for whosoever\r\nhas the greatest number of skins to wipe the hands upon, he is judged to\r\nbe the bravest man. Many also make cloaks to wear of the skins stripped\r\noff, sewing them together like shepherds' cloaks of skins; 66 and many\r\ntake the skin together with the finger-nails off the right hands of\r\ntheir enemies when they are dead, and make them into covers for their\r\nquivers: now human skin it seems is both thick and glossy in appearance,\r\nmore brilliantly white than any other skin. Many also take the skins\r\noff the whole bodies of men and stretch them on pieces of wood and carry\r\nthem about on their horses.\r\n\r\n65. Such are their established customs about these things; and to the\r\nskulls themselves, not of all but of their greatest enemies, they do\r\nthus:—the man saws off all below the eyebrows and clears out the inside;\r\nand if he is a poor man he only stretches ox-hide round it and then\r\nmakes use of it; but if he be rich, besides stretching the ox-hide he\r\ngilds it over within, and makes use of it as a drinking-cup. They do\r\nthis also if any of their own family have been at variance with them and\r\nthe man gets the better of his adversary in trial before the king; and\r\nwhen strangers come to him whom he highly esteems, he sets these skulls\r\nbefore them, and adds the comment that they being of his own family had\r\nmade war against him, and that he had got the better of them; and this\r\nthey hold to be a proof of manly virtue.\r\n\r\n66. Once every year each ruler of a district mixes in his own district\r\na bowl of wine, from which those of the Scythians drink by whom enemies\r\nhave been slain; but those by whom this has not been done do not taste\r\nof the wine, but sit apart dishonoured; and this is the greatest of\r\nall disgraces among them: but those of them who have slain a very great\r\nnumber of men, drink with two cups together at the same time.\r\n\r\n67. Diviners there are many among the Scythians, and they divine with a\r\nnumber of willow rods in the following manner:—they bring large bundles\r\nof rods, and having laid them on the ground they unroll them, and\r\nsetting each rod by itself apart they prophesy; and while speaking thus,\r\nthey roll the rods together again, and after that they place them in\r\norder a second time one by one. 67 This manner of divination they have\r\nfrom their fathers: but the Enareës or \"man-women\" 68 say that Aphrodite\r\ngave them the gift of divination, and they divine accordingly with\r\nthe bark of the linden-tree. Having divided the linden-bark into three\r\nstrips, the man twists them together in his fingers and untwists them\r\nagain, and as he does this he utters the oracle.\r\n\r\n68. When the king of the Scythians is sick, he sends for three of the\r\ndiviners, namely those who are most in repute, who divine in the manner\r\nwhich has been said: and these say for the most part something like\r\nthis, namely that so and so has sworn falsely by the hearth of the king,\r\nand they name one of the citizens, whosoever it may happen to be: now it\r\nis the prevailing custom of the Scythians to swear by the hearth of the\r\nking at the times when they desire to swear the most solemn oath. He\r\nthen who they say has sworn falsely, is brought forthwith held fast on\r\nboth sides; and when he has come the diviners charge him with this, that\r\nhe is shown by their divination to have sworn falsely by the hearth of\r\nthe king, and that for this reason the king is suffering pain: and\r\nhe denies and says that he did not swear falsely, and complains\r\nindignantly: and when he denies it, the king sends for other diviners\r\ntwice as many in number, and if these also by looking into their\r\ndivination pronounce him guilty of having sworn falsely, at once they\r\ncut off the man's head, and the diviners who came first part his goods\r\namong them by lot; but if the diviners who came in afterwards acquit\r\nhim, other diviners come in, and again others after them. If then the\r\ngreater number acquit the man, the sentence is that the first diviners\r\nshall themselves be put to death.\r\n\r\n69. They put them to death accordingly in the following manner:—first\r\nthey fill a waggon with brushwood and yoke oxen to it; then having bound\r\nthe feet of the diviners and tied their hands behind them and stopped\r\ntheir mouths with gags, they fasten them down in the middle of the\r\nbrushwood, and having set fire to it they scare the oxen and let them\r\ngo: and often the oxen are burnt to death together with the diviners,\r\nand often they escape after being scorched, when the pole to which they\r\nare fastened has been burnt: and they burn the diviners in the manner\r\ndescribed for other causes also, calling them false prophets. Now when\r\nthe king puts any to death, he does not leave alive their sons either,\r\nbut he puts to death all the males, not doing any hurt to the females.\r\n\r\n70. In the following manner the Scythians make oaths to whomsoever they\r\nmake them:—they pour wine into a great earthenware cup and mingle with\r\nit blood of those who are taking the oath to one another, either making\r\na prick with an awl or cutting with a dagger a little way into their\r\nbody, and then they dip into the cup a sword and arrows and a battle-axe\r\nand a javelin; and having done this, they invoke many curses on the\r\nbreaker of the oath, and afterwards they drink it off, both they who are\r\nmaking the oath and the most honourable of their company.\r\n\r\n71. The burial-place of the kings is in the land of the Gerrians, the\r\nplace up to which the Borysthenes is navigable. In this place, when\r\ntheir king has died, they make a large square excavation in the earth;\r\nand when they have made this ready, they take up the corpse (the body\r\nbeing covered over with wax and the belly ripped up and cleansed, and\r\nthen sewn together again, after it has been filled with kyperos 69\r\ncut up and spices and parsley-seed and anise), and they convey it in\r\na waggon to another nation. Then those who receive the corpse thus\r\nconveyed to them do the same as the Royal Scythians, that is they\r\ncut off a part of their ear and shave their hair round about and cut\r\nthemselves all over the arms and tear their forehead and nose and pass\r\narrows through their left hand. Thence they convey in the waggon the\r\ncorpse of the king to another of the nations over whom they rule; and\r\nthey to whom they came before accompany them: and when they have gone\r\nround to all conveying the corpse, then they are in the land of the\r\nGerrians, who have their settlements furthest away of all the nations\r\nover whom they rule, and they have reached the spot where the burial\r\nplace is. After that, having placed the corpse in the tomb upon a bed of\r\nleaves, they stick spears along on this side and that of the corpse and\r\nstretch pieces of wood over them, and then they cover the place in with\r\nmatting. Then they strangle and bury in the remaining space of the\r\ntomb one of the king's mistresses, his cup-bearer, his cook, his\r\nhorse-keeper, his attendant, and his bearer of messages, and also\r\nhorses, and a first portion of all things else, and cups of gold; for\r\nsilver they do not use at all, nor yet bronze. 70 Having thus done they\r\nall join together to pile up a great mound, vying with one another and\r\nzealously endeavouring to make it as large as possible.\r\n\r\n72. Afterwards, when the year comes round again, they do as\r\nfollows:—they take the most capable of the remaining servants,—and these\r\nare native Scythians, for those serve him whom the king himself commands\r\nto do so, and his servants are not bought for money,—of these attendants\r\nthen they strangle fifty and also fifty of the finest horses; and when\r\nthey have taken out their bowels and cleansed the belly, they fill it\r\nwith chaff and sew it together again. Then they set the half of a wheel\r\nupon two stakes with the hollow side upwards, and the other half of the\r\nwheel upon other two stakes, and in this manner they fix a number of\r\nthese; and after this they run thick stakes through the length of the\r\nhorses as far as the necks, and they mount them upon the wheels; and the\r\nfront pieces of wheel support the shoulders of the horses, while those\r\nbehind bear up their bellies, going by the side of the thighs; and both\r\nfront and hind legs hang in the air. On the horses they put bridles and\r\nbits, and stretch the bridles tight in front of them and then tie them\r\nup to pegs: and of the fifty young men who have been strangled they\r\nmount each one upon his horse, having first 71 run a straight stake\r\nthrough each body along by the spine up to the neck; and a part of this\r\nstake projects below, which they fasten into a socket made in the other\r\nstake that runs through the horse. Having set horsemen such as I have\r\ndescribed in a circle round the tomb, they then ride away.\r\n\r\n73. Thus they bury their kings; but as for the other Scythians, when\r\nthey die their nearest relations carry them round laid in waggons to\r\ntheir friends in succession; and of them each one when he receives the\r\nbody entertains those who accompany it, and before the corpse they serve\r\nup of all things about the same quantity as before the others. Thus\r\nprivate persons are carried about for forty days, and then they are\r\nburied: and after burying them the Scythians cleanse themselves in the\r\nfollowing way:—they soap their heads and wash them well, and then, for\r\ntheir body, they set up three stakes leaning towards one another and\r\nabout them they stretch woollen felt coverings, and when they have\r\nclosed them as much as possible they throw stones heated red-hot into a\r\nbasin placed in the middle of the stakes and the felt coverings.\r\n\r\n74. Now they have hemp growing in their land, which is very like flax\r\nexcept in thickness and in height, for in these respects the hemp is\r\nmuch superior. This grows both of itself and with cultivation; and of\r\nit the Thracians even make garments, which are very like those made of\r\nflaxen thread, so that he who was not specially conversant with it would\r\nnot be able to decide whether the garments were of flax or of hemp; and\r\nhe who had not before seen stuff woven of hemp would suppose that the\r\ngarment was made of flax.\r\n\r\n75. The Scythians then take the seed of this hemp and creep under the\r\nfelt coverings, and then they throw the seed upon the stones which have\r\nbeen heated red-hot: and it burns like incense and produces a vapour so\r\nthick that no vapour-bath in Hellas would surpass it: and the Scythians\r\nbeing delighted with the vapour-bath howl like wolves. 72 This is to\r\nthem instead of washing, for in fact they do not wash their bodies at\r\nall in water. Their women however pound with a rough stone the wood of\r\nthe cypress and cedar and frankincense tree, pouring in water with it,\r\nand then with this pounded stuff, which is thick, they plaster over all\r\ntheir body and also their face; and not only does a sweet smell attach\r\nto them by reason of this, but also when they take off the plaster on\r\nthe next day, their skin is clean and shining.\r\n\r\n76. This nation also 73 is very averse to adopting strange customs,\r\nrejecting even those of other tribes among themselves, 74 but especially\r\nthose of the Hellenes, as the history of Anacharsis and also afterwards\r\nof Skyles proved. 75 For as to Anacharsis first, when he was returning\r\nto the abodes of the Scythians, after having visited many lands 76 and\r\ndisplayed in them much wisdom, as he sailed through the Hellespont he\r\nput in to Kyzicos: and since he found the people of Kyzicos celebrating\r\na festival very magnificently in honour of the Mother of the gods,\r\nAnacharsis vowed to the Mother that if he should return safe and sound\r\nto his own land, he would both sacrifice to her with the same rites as\r\nhe saw the men of Kyzicos do, and also hold a night festival. So when\r\nhe came to Scythia he went down into the region called Hylaia (this is\r\nalong by the side of the racecourse of Achilles and is quite full, as it\r\nhappens, of trees of all kinds),—into this, I say, Anacharsis went down,\r\nand proceeded to perform all the ceremonies of the festival in honour of\r\nthe goddess, with a kettle-drum and with images hung about himself. And\r\none of the Scythians perceived him doing this and declared it to Saulios\r\nthe king; and the king came himself also, and when he saw Anacharsis\r\ndoing this, he shot him with an arrow and killed him. Accordingly at the\r\npresent time if one asks about Anacharsis, the Scythians say that they\r\ndo not know him, and for this reason, because he went out of his own\r\ncountry to Hellas and adopted foreign customs. And as I heard from\r\nTymnes the steward 77 of Ariapeithes, he was the uncle on the father's\r\nside of Idanthyrsos king of the Scythians, and the son of Gnuros, the\r\nson of Lycos, the son of Spargapeithes. If then Anacharsis was of\r\nthis house, let him know that he died by the hand of his brother,\r\nfor Idanthyrsos was the son of Saulios, and Saulios was he who killed\r\nAnacharsis.\r\n\r\n77. However I have heard also another story, told by the Peloponnesians,\r\nthat Anacharsis was sent out by the king of the Scythians, and so made\r\nhimself a disciple of Hellas; and that when he returned back he said\r\nto him that had sent him forth, that the Hellenes were all busied about\r\nevery kind of cleverness except the Lacedemonians; but these alone knew\r\nhow to exchange speech sensibly. This story however has been invented 78\r\nwithout any ground by the Hellenes themselves; and however that may be,\r\nthe man was slain in the way that was related above.\r\n\r\n78. This man then fared thus badly by reason of foreign customs and\r\ncommunication with Hellenes; and very many years afterwards Skyles the\r\nson of Ariapeithes suffered nearly the same fate as he. For Ariapeithes\r\nthe king of the Scythians with other sons had Skyles born to him: and\r\nhe was born of a woman who was of Istria, and certainly not a native of\r\nScythia; and this mother taught him the language and letters of Hellas.\r\nAfterwards in course of time Ariapeithes was brought to his end by\r\ntreachery at the hands of Spargapeithes the king of the Agathyrsians,\r\nand Skyles succeeded to the kingdom; and he took not only that but also\r\nthe wife of his father, whose name was Opoia: this Opoia was a native\r\nScythian and from her was born Oricos to Ariapeithes. Now when Skyles\r\nwas king of the Scythians, he was by no means satisfied with the\r\nScythian manner of life, but was much more inclined towards Hellenic\r\nways because of the training with which he had been brought up, and he\r\nused to do somewhat as follows:—When he came with the Scythians in arms\r\nto the city of the Borysthenites (now these Borysthenites say that they\r\nare of Miletos),—when Skyles came to these, he would leave his band in\r\nthe suburbs of the city and go himself within the walls and close the\r\ngates. After that he would lay aside his Scythian equipments and\r\ntake Hellenic garments, and wearing them he would go about in the\r\nmarket-place with no guards or any other man accompanying him (and they\r\nwatched the gates meanwhile, that none of the Scythians might see him\r\nwearing this dress): and while in other respects too he adopted Hellenic\r\nmanners of life, he used also to perform worship to the gods according\r\nto the customs of the Hellenes. Then having stayed a month or more than\r\nthat, he would put on the Scythian dress and depart. This he did many\r\ntimes, and he both built for himself a house in Borysthenes and also\r\ntook to it a woman of the place as his wife.\r\n\r\n79. Since however it was fated that evil should happen to him, it\r\nhappened by an occasion of this kind:—he formed a desire to be initiated\r\nin the rites of Bacchus-Dionysos, and as he was just about to receive 79\r\nthe initiation, there happened a very great portent. He had in the city\r\nof the Borysthenites a house of great size and built with large expense,\r\nof which also I made mention a little before this, and round it were\r\nplaced sphinxes and griffins of white stone: on this house Zeus 7901\r\ncaused a bolt to fall; and the house was altogether burnt down,\r\nbut Skyles none the less for this completed his initiation. Now the\r\nScythians make the rites of Bacchus a reproach against the Hellenes, for\r\nthey say that it is not fitting to invent a god like this, who impels\r\nmen to frenzy. So when Skyles had been initiated into the rites of\r\nBacchus, one of the Borysthenites went off 80 to the Scythians and said:\r\n\"Whereas ye laugh at us, O Scythians, because we perform the rite of\r\nBacchus and because the god seizes us, now this divinity has seized also\r\nyour king; and he is both joining in the rite of Bacchus and maddened\r\nby the influence of the god. And if ye disbelieve me, follow and I\r\nwill show you.\" The chief men of the Scythians followed him, and the\r\nBorysthenite led them secretly into the town and set them upon a\r\ntower. So when Skyles passed by with the company of revellers, and the\r\nScythians saw him joining in the rite of Bacchus, they were exceedingly\r\ngrieved at it, and they went out and declared to the whole band that\r\nwhich they had seen.\r\n\r\n80. After this when Skyles was riding out again to his own abode, the\r\nScythians took his brother Octamasades for their leader, who was a son\r\nof the daughter of Teres, and made insurrection against Skyles. He then\r\nwhen he perceived that which was being done to his hurt and for what\r\nreason it was being done, fled for refuge to Thrace; and Octamasades\r\nbeing informed of this, proceeded to march upon Thrace. So when he had\r\narrived at the river Ister, the Thracians met him; and as they were\r\nabout to engage battle, Sitalkes sent a messenger to Octamasades and\r\nsaid: \"Why must we make trial of one another in fight? Thou art my\r\nsister's son and thou hast in thy power my brother. Do thou give him\r\nback to me, and I will deliver to thee thy brother Skyles: and let\r\nus not either of us set our armies in peril, either thou or I.\" Thus\r\nSitalkes proposed to him by a herald; for there was with Octamasades\r\na brother of Sitalkes, who had gone into exile for fear of him. And\r\nOctamasades agreed to this, and by giving up his own mother's brother to\r\nSitalkes he received his brother Skyles in exchange: and Sitalkes when\r\nhe received his brother led him away as a prisoner, but Octamasades\r\ncut off the head of Skyles there upon the spot. Thus do the Scythians\r\ncarefully guard their own customary observances, and such are the\r\npenalties which they inflict upon those who acquire foreign customs\r\nbesides their own.\r\n\r\n81. How many the Scythians are I was not able to ascertain precisely,\r\nbut I heard various reports of the number: for reports say both that\r\nthey are very many in number and also that they are few, at least as\r\nregards the true Scythians. 81 Thus far however they gave me evidence of\r\nmy own eyesight:—there is between the river Borysthenes and the Hypanis\r\na place called Exampaios, of which also I made mention somewhat before\r\nthis, saying that there was in it a spring of bitter water, from which\r\nthe water flows and makes the river Hypanis unfit to drink. In this\r\nplace there is set a bronze bowl, in size at least six times as large as\r\nthe mixing-bowl at the entrance of the Pontus, which Pausanias the son\r\nof Cleombrotos dedicated: and for him who has never seen that, I will\r\nmake the matter clear by saying that the bowl in Scythia holds easily\r\nsix hundred amphors, 82 and the thickness of this Scythian bowl is six\r\nfingers. This then the natives of the place told me had been made of\r\narrow-heads: for their king, they said, whose name was Ariantas, wishing\r\nto know how many the Scythians were, ordered all the Scythians to bring\r\none arrow-head, each from his own arrow, and whosoever should not bring\r\none, he threatened with death. So a great multitude of arrow-heads was\r\nbrought, and he resolved to make of them a memorial and to leave it\r\nbehind him: from these then, they said, he made this bronze bowl and\r\ndedicated it in this place Exampaios.\r\n\r\n82. This is what I heard about the number of the Scythians. Now this\r\nland has no marvellous things except that it has rivers which are by far\r\nlarger and more numerous than those of any other land. One thing however\r\nshall be mentioned which it has to show, and which is worthy of wonder\r\neven besides the rivers and the greatness of the plain, that is to say,\r\nthey point out a footprint of Heracles in the rock by the bank of the\r\nriver Tyras, which in shape is like the mark of a man's foot but in size\r\nis two cubits long. This then is such as I have said; and I will go back\r\nnow to the history which I was about to tell at first.\r\n\r\n83. While Dareios was preparing to go against the Scythians and was\r\nsending messengers to appoint to some the furnishing of a land-army, to\r\nothers that of ships, and to others the bridging over of the Thracian\r\nBosphorus, Artabanos, the son of Hystaspes and brother of Dareios, urged\r\nhim by no means to make the march against the Scythians, telling him\r\nhow difficult the Scythians were to deal with. Since however he did not\r\npersuade him, though he gave him good counsel, he ceased to urge; and\r\nDareios, when all his preparations had been made, began to march his\r\narmy forth from Susa.\r\n\r\n84. Then one of the Persians, Oiobazos, made request to Dareios that as\r\nhe had three sons and all were serving in the expedition, one might be\r\nleft behind for him: and Dareios said that as he was a friend and made a\r\nreasonable request, he would leave behind all the sons. So Oiobazos was\r\ngreatly rejoiced, supposing that his sons had been freed from service,\r\nbut Dareios commanded those who had the charge of such things to put to\r\ndeath all the sons of Oiobazos.\r\n\r\n85. These then were left, having been slain upon the spot where they\r\nwere: and Dareios meanwhile set forth from Susa and arrived at the\r\nplace on the Bosphorus where the bridge of ships had been made, in the\r\nterritory of Chalcedon; and there he embarked in a ship and sailed\r\nto the so-called Kyanean rocks, which the Hellenes say formerly moved\r\nbackwards and forwards; and taking his seat at the temple 83 he gazed\r\nupon the Pontus, which is a sight well worth seeing. Of all seas indeed\r\nit is the most marvellous in its nature. The length of it is eleven\r\nthousand one hundred furlongs, 84 and the breadth, where it is broadest,\r\nthree thousand three hundred: and of this great Sea the mouth is but\r\nfour furlongs broad, and the length of the mouth, that is of the neck of\r\nwater which is called Bosphorus, where, as I said, the bridge of ships\r\nhad been made, is not less than a hundred and twenty furlongs. This\r\nBosphorus extends to the Propontis; and the Propontis, being in breadth\r\nfive hundred furlongs and in length one thousand four hundred, has its\r\noutlet into the Hellespont, which is but seven furlongs broad at the\r\nnarrowest place, though it is four hundred furlongs in length: and the\r\nHellespont runs out into that expanse of sea which is called the Egean.\r\n\r\n86. These measurements I have made as follows:—a ship completes on an\r\naverage in a long day a distance of seventy thousand fathoms, and in\r\na night sixty thousand. Now we know that to the river Phasis from the\r\nmouth of the Sea (for it is here that the Pontus is longest) is a voyage\r\nof nine days and eight nights, which amounts to one hundred and eleven\r\nmyriads 85 of fathoms; and these fathoms are eleven thousand one hundred\r\nfurlongs. Then from the land of the Sindians to Themiskyra on the river\r\nThermodon (for here is the broadest part of the Pontus) it is a voyage\r\nof three days and two nights, which amounts to thirty-three myriads 86\r\nof fathoms or three thousand three hundred furlongs. This Pontus then\r\nand also the Bosphorus and the Hellespont have been measured by me thus,\r\nand their nature is such as has been said: and this Pontus also has a\r\nlake which has its outlet into it, which lake is not much less in size\r\nthan the Pontus itself, and it is called Maiotis and \"Mother of the\r\nPontus.\"\r\n\r\n87. Dareios then having gazed upon the Pontus sailed back to the bridge,\r\nof which Mandrocles a Samian had been chief constructor; and having\r\ngazed upon the Bosphorus also, he set up two pillars 8601 by it of white\r\nstone with characters cut upon them, on the one Assyrian and on the\r\nother Hellenic, being the names of all the nations which he was leading\r\nwith him: and he was leading with him all over whom he was ruler. The\r\nwhole number of them without the naval force was reckoned to be seventy\r\nmyriads 87 including cavalry, and ships had been gathered together to\r\nthe number of six hundred. These pillars the Byzantians conveyed to\r\ntheir city after the events of which I speak, and used them for the\r\naltar of Artemis Orthosia, excepting one stone, which was left standing\r\nby the side of the temple of Dionysos in Byzantion, covered over with\r\nAssyrian characters. Now the place on the Bosphorus where Dareios made\r\nhis bridge is, as I conclude, 8701 midway between Byzantion and the\r\ntemple at the mouth of the Pontus.\r\n\r\n88. After this Dareios being pleased with the floating bridge rewarded\r\nthe chief constructor of it, Mandrocles the Samian, with gifts tenfold;\r\n88 and as an offering from these Mandrocles had a painting made of\r\nfigures to present the whole scene of the bridge over the Bosphorus and\r\nking Dareios sitting in a prominent seat and his army crossing over;\r\nthis he caused to be painted and dedicated it as an offering in the\r\ntemple of Hera, with the following inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Bosphorus having bridged over, the straits fish-abounding, to Hera\r\n    Mandrocleës dedicates this, of his work to record;\r\n  A crown on himself he set, and he brought to the Samians glory,\r\n    And for Dareios performed everything after his mind.\"\r\n\r\n89. This memorial was made of him who constructed the bridge: and\r\nDareios, after he had rewarded Mandrocles with gifts, passed over into\r\nEurope, having first commanded the Ionians to sail into the Pontus as\r\nfar as the river Ister, and when they arrived at the Ister, there to\r\nwait for him, making a bridge meanwhile over the river; for the chief of\r\nhis naval force were the Ionians, the Aiolians and the Hellespontians.\r\nSo the fleet sailed through between the Kyanean rocks and made straight\r\nfor the Ister; and then they sailed up the river a two days' voyage from\r\nthe sea and proceeded to make a bridge across the neck, as it were, of\r\nthe river, where the mouths of the Ister part off. Dareios meanwhile,\r\nhaving crossed the Bosphorus on the floating bridge, was advancing\r\nthrough Thrace, and when he came to the sources of the river Tearos he\r\nencamped for three days.\r\n\r\n90. Now the Tearos is said by those who dwell near it to be the best of\r\nall rivers, both in other respects which tend to healing and especially\r\nfor curing diseases of the skin 89 both in men and in horses: and its\r\nsprings are thirty-eight in number, flowing all from the same rock, of\r\nwhich some are cold and others warm. The way to them is of equal length\r\nfrom the city of Heraion near Perinthos and from Apollonia upon the\r\nEuxine Sea, that is to say two days' journey by each road. This Tearos\r\nruns into the river Contadesdos and the Contadesdos into the Agrianes\r\nand the Agrianes into the Hebros, which flows into the sea by the city\r\nof Ainos.\r\n\r\n91. Dareios then, having come to this river and having encamped there,\r\nwas pleased with the river and set up a pillar there also, with an\r\ninscription as follows: \"The head-springs of the river Tearos give the\r\nbest and fairest water of all rivers; and to them came leading an army\r\nagainst the Scythians the best and fairest of all men, Dareios the son\r\nof Hystaspes, of the Persians and of all the Continent king.\" These were\r\nthe words which were there written.\r\n\r\n92. Dareios then set out from thence and came to another river whose\r\nname is Artescos, which flows through the land of the Odrysians. Having\r\ncome to this river he did as follows:—he appointed a place for his\r\narmy and bade every man as he passed out by it place one stone in this\r\nappointed place: and when the army had performed this, then he marched\r\naway his army leaving behind great mounds of these stones.\r\n\r\n93. But before he came to the Ister he conquered first the Getai, who\r\nbelieve in immortality: for the Thracians who occupy Salmydessos and\r\nare settled above the cities of Apollonian and Mesambria, called the\r\nKyrmianai 90 and the Nipsaioi, delivered themselves over to Dareios\r\nwithout fighting; but the Getai, who are the bravest and the most\r\nupright in their dealings of all the Thracians, having betaken\r\nthemselves to obstinacy were forthwith subdued.\r\n\r\n94. And their belief in immortality is of this kind, that is to say,\r\nthey hold that they do not die, but that he who is killed goes to\r\nSalmoxis, 91 a divinity, 92 whom some of them call Gebeleizis; and at\r\nintervals of four years 93 they send one of themselves, whomsoever\r\nthe lot may select, as a messenger to Salmoxis, charging him with\r\nsuch requests as they have to make on each occasion; and they send him\r\nthus:—certain of them who are appointed for this have three javelins,\r\nand others meanwhile take hold on both sides of him who is being sent to\r\nSalmoxis, both by his hands and his feet, and first they swing him up,\r\nthen throw him into the air so as to fall upon the spear-points: and\r\nif when he is pierced through he is killed, they think that the god is\r\nfavourable to them; but if he is not killed, they find fault with the\r\nmessenger himself, calling him a worthless man, and then having\r\nfound fault with him they send another: and they give him the charge\r\nbeforehand, while he is yet alive. These same Thracians also shoot\r\narrows up towards the sky when thunder and lightning come, and use\r\nthreats to the god, not believing that there exists any other god except\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n95. This Salmoxis I hear from the Hellenes who dwell about the\r\nHellespont and the Pontus, was a man, and he became a slave in Samos,\r\nand was in fact a slave of Pythagoras the son of Mnesarchos. Then having\r\nbecome free he gained great wealth, and afterwards returned to his\r\nown land: and as the Thracians both live hardly and are rather\r\nsimple-minded, this Salmoxis, being acquainted with the Ionian way of\r\nliving and with manners more cultivated 94 than the Thracians were used\r\nto see, since he had associated with Hellenes (and not only that but\r\nwith Pythagoras, not the least able philosopher 95 of the Hellenes),\r\nprepared a banqueting-hall, 96 where he received and feasted the chief\r\nmen of the tribe and instructed them meanwhile that neither he himself\r\nnor his guests nor their descendants in succession after them would die;\r\nbut that they would come to a place where they would live for ever and\r\nhave all things good. While he was doing that which has been mentioned\r\nand was saying these things, he was making for himself meanwhile\r\na chamber under the ground; and when his chamber was finished, he\r\ndisappeared from among the Thracians and went down into the underground\r\nchamber, where he continued to live for three years: and they grieved\r\nfor his loss and mourned for him as dead. Then in the fourth year he\r\nappeared to the Thracians, and in this way the things which Salmoxis\r\nsaid became credible to them.\r\n\r\n96. Thus they say that he did; but as to this matter and the chamber\r\nunder ground, I neither disbelieve it nor do I very strongly believe,\r\nbut I think that this Salmoxis lived many years before Pythagoras.\r\nHowever, whether there ever lived a man Salmoxis, or whether he is\r\nsimply a native deity of the Getai, let us bid farewell to him now.\r\n\r\n97. These, I say, having such manners as I have said, were subdued by\r\nthe Persians and accompanied the rest of the army: and when Dareios and\r\nwith him the land-army arrived at the Ister, then after all had passed\r\nover, Dareios commanded the Ionians to break up the floating bridge and\r\nto accompany him by land, as well as the rest of the troops which were\r\nin the ships: and when the Ionians were just about to break it up and to\r\ndo that which he commanded, Coës the son of Erxander, who was commander\r\nof the Mytilenians, said thus to Dareios, having first inquired whether\r\nhe was disposed to listen to an opinion from one who desired to declare\r\nit: \"O king, seeing that thou art about to march upon a land where no\r\ncultivated ground will be seen nor any inhabited town, do thou therefore\r\nlet this bridge remain where it is, leaving to guard it those same\r\nmen who constructed it. Then, if we find the Scythians and fare as we\r\ndesire, we have a way of return; and also even if we shall not be able\r\nto find them, at least our way of return is secured: for that we should\r\nbe worsted by the Scythians in fight I never feared yet, but rather that\r\nwe might not be able to find them, and might suffer some disaster in\r\nwandering about. Perhaps some one will say that in speaking thus I am\r\nspeaking for my own advantage, in order that I may remain behind; but in\r\ntruth I am bringing forward, O king, the opinion which I found best for\r\nthee, and I myself will accompany thee and not be left behind.\" With\r\nthis opinion Dareios was very greatly pleased and made answer to him in\r\nthese words: \"Friend from Lesbos, when I have returned safe to my house,\r\nbe sure that thou appear before me, in order that I may requite thee\r\nwith good deeds for good counsel.\"\r\n\r\n98. Having thus said and having tied sixty knots in a thong, he called\r\nthe despots of the Ionians to speak with him and said as follows:\r\n\"Men of Ionia, know that I have given up the opinion which I formerly\r\ndeclared with regard to the bridge; and do ye keep this thong and do\r\nas I shall say:—so soon as ye shall have seen me go forward against the\r\nScythians, from that time begin, and untie a knot on each day: and if\r\nwithin this time I am not here, and ye find that the days marked by the\r\nknots have passed by, then sail away to your own lands. Till then, since\r\nour resolve has thus been changed, guard the floating bridge, showing\r\nall diligence to keep it safe and to guard it. And thus acting, ye will\r\ndo for me a very acceptable service.\" Thus said Dareios and hastened on\r\nhis march forwards.\r\n\r\n99. Now in front of Scythia in the direction towards the sea 97 lies\r\nThrace; and where a bay is formed in this land, there begins Scythia,\r\ninto which the Ister flows out, the mouth of the river being turned\r\ntowards the South-East Wind. Beginning at the Ister then I am about to\r\ndescribe the coast land of the true Scythia, with regard to measurement.\r\nAt once from the Ister begins this original land of Scythia, and it\r\nlies towards the midday and the South Wind, extending as far as the city\r\ncalled Carkinitis. After this the part which lies on the coast of the\r\nsame sea still, a country which is mountainous and runs out in the\r\ndirection of the Pontus, is occupied by the Tauric race, as far as the\r\npeninsula which is called the \"Rugged Chersonese\"; and this extends to\r\nthe sea which lies towards the East Wind: for two sides of the Scythian\r\nboundaries lie along by the sea, one by the sea on the South, and the\r\nother by that on the East, just as it is with Attica: and in truth the\r\nTauroi occupy a part of Scythia which has much resemblance to Attica; it\r\nis as if in Attica another race and not the Athenians occupied the hill\r\nregion 98 of Sunion, supposing it to project more at the point into\r\nthe sea, that region namely which is cut off by a line from Thoricos to\r\nAnaphlystos. Such I say, if we may be allowed to compare small things\r\nsuch as this with great, is the form of the Tauric land. 99 For him\r\nhowever who has not sailed along this part of the coast of Attica I will\r\nmake it clear by another comparison:—it is as if in Iapygia another race\r\nand not the Iapygians had cut off for themselves and were holding\r\nthat extremity of the land which is bounded by a line beginning at the\r\nharbour of Brentesion and running to Taras. And in mentioning these two\r\nsimilar cases I am suggesting many other things also to which the Tauric\r\nland has resemblance.\r\n\r\n100. After the Tauric land immediately come Scythians again, occupying\r\nthe parts above the Tauroi and the coasts of the Eastern sea, that is to\r\nsay the parts to the West of the Kimmerian Bosphorus and of the Maiotian\r\nlake, as far as the river Tanaïs, which runs into the corner of this\r\nlake. In the upper parts which tend inland Scythia is bounded (as we\r\nknow) 100 by the Agathyrsians first, beginning from the Ister, and\r\nthen by the Neuroi, afterwards by the Androphagoi, and lastly by the\r\nMelanchlainoi.\r\n\r\n101. Scythia then being looked upon as a four-sided figure with two of\r\nits sides bordered by the sea, has its border lines equal to one another\r\nin each direction, that which tends inland and that which runs along\r\nby the sea: for from Ister to the Borysthenes is ten days' journey,\r\nand from the Borysthenes to the Maiotian lake ten days' more; and\r\nthe distance inland to the Melanchlainoi, who are settled above the\r\nScythians, is a journey of twenty days. Now I have reckoned the day's\r\njourney at two hundred furlongs: 101 and by this reckoning the cross\r\nlines of Scythia 102 would be four thousand furlongs in length, and the\r\nperpendiculars which tend inland would be the same number of furlongs.\r\nSuch is the size of this land.\r\n\r\n102. The Scythians meanwhile having considered with themselves that they\r\nwere not able to repel the army of Dareios alone by a pitched battle,\r\nproceeded to send messengers to those who dwelt near them: and already\r\nthe kings of these nations had come together and were taking counsel\r\nwith one another, since so great an army was marching towards them. Now\r\nthose who had come together were the kings of the Tauroi, Agathyrsians,\r\nNeuroi, Androphagoi, Melanchlainoi, Gelonians, Budinoi and Sauromatai.\r\n\r\n103. Of these the Tauroi have the following customs:—they sacrifice to\r\nthe \"Maiden\" both ship-wrecked persons and also those Hellenes whom they\r\ncan capture by putting out to sea against them; 103 and their manner\r\nof sacrifice is this:—when they have made the first offering from the\r\nvictim they strike his head with a club: and some say that they push\r\nthe body down from the top of the cliff (for it is upon a cliff that\r\nthe temple is placed) and set the head up on a stake; but others, while\r\nagreeing as to the heads, say nevertheless that the body is not pushed\r\ndown from the top of the cliff, but buried in the earth. This divinity\r\nto whom they sacrifice, the Tauroi themselves say is Iphigeneia the\r\ndaughter of Agamemnon. Whatsoever enemies they have conquered they\r\ntreat in this fashion:—each man cuts off a head and bears it away to his\r\nhouse; then he impales it on a long stake and sets it up above his house\r\nraised to a great height, generally above the chimney; and they say that\r\nthese are suspended above as guards to preserve the whole house. This\r\npeople has its living by plunder and war.\r\n\r\n104. The Agathyrsians are the most luxurious of men and wear gold\r\nornaments for the most part: also they have promiscuous intercourse with\r\ntheir women, in order that they may be brethren to one another and being\r\nall nearly related may not feel envy or malice one against another. In\r\ntheir other customs they have come to resemble the Thracians.\r\n\r\n105. The Neuroi practise the Scythian customs: and one generation before\r\nthe expedition of Dareios it so befell them that they were forced\r\nto quit their land altogether by reason of serpents: for their land\r\nproduced serpents in vast numbers, and they fell upon them in still\r\nlarger numbers from the desert country above their borders; until at\r\nlast being hard pressed they left their own land and settled among the\r\nBudinoi. These men it would seem are wizards; for it is said of them by\r\nthe Scythians and by the Hellenes who are settled in the Scythian land\r\nthat once in every year each of the Neuroi becomes a wolf for a few\r\ndays and then returns again to his original form. For my part I do not\r\nbelieve them when they say this, but they say it nevertheless, and swear\r\nit moreover.\r\n\r\n106. The Androphagoi have the most savage manners of all human beings,\r\nand they neither acknowledge any rule of right nor observe any customary\r\nlaw. They are nomads and wear clothing like that of the Scythians, but\r\nhave a language of their own; and alone of all these nations they are\r\nman-eaters.\r\n\r\n107. The Melanchlainoi wear all of them black clothing, whence also they\r\nhave their name; and they practise the customs of the Scythians.\r\n\r\n108. The Budinoi are a very great and numerous race, and are all very\r\nblue-eyed and fair of skin: and in their land is built a city of wood,\r\nthe name of which is Gelonos, and each side of the wall is thirty\r\nfurlongs in length and lofty at the same time, all being of wood; and\r\nthe houses are of wood also and the temples; for there are in it temples\r\nof Hellenic gods furnished after Hellenic fashion with sacred images and\r\naltars and cells, 104 all of wood; and they keep festivals every\r\nother year 105 to Dionysos and celebrate the rites of Bacchus: for the\r\nGelonians are originally Hellenes, and they removed 106 from the trading\r\nstations on the coast and settled among the Budinoi; and they use partly\r\nthe Scythian language and partly the Hellenic. The Budinoi however\r\ndo not use the same language as the Gelonians, nor is their manner of\r\nliving the same:\r\n\r\n109, for the Budinoi are natives of the soil and a nomad people, and\r\nalone of the nations in these parts feed on fir-cones; 107 but the\r\nGelonians are tillers of the ground and feed on corn and have gardens,\r\nand resemble them not at all either in appearance or in complexion of\r\nskin. However by the Hellenes the Budinoi also are called Gelonians,\r\nnot being rightly so called. Their land is all thickly overgrown with\r\nforests of all kinds of trees, and in the thickest forest there is a\r\nlarge and deep lake, and round it marshy ground and reeds. In this\r\nare caught otters and beavers and certainly other wild animals with\r\nsquare-shaped faces. The fur of these is sewn as a fringe round their\r\ncoats of skin, and the testicles are made use of by them for curing\r\ndiseases of the womb.\r\n\r\n110. About the Sauromatai the following tale is told:—When the Hellenes\r\nhad fought with the Amazons,—now the Amazons are called by the Scythians\r\nOiorpata, 108 which name means in the Hellenic tongue \"slayers of men,\"\r\nfor \"man\" they call oior, and pata means \"to slay,\"—then, as the\r\nstory goes, the Hellenes, having conquered them in the battle at the\r\nThermodon, were sailing away and conveying with them in three ships as\r\nmany Amazons as they were able to take prisoners. These in the open sea\r\nset upon the men and cast them out of the ships; but they knew nothing\r\nabout ships, nor how to use rudders or sails or oars, and after they\r\nhad cast out the men they were driven about by wave and wind and came to\r\nthat part of the Maiotian lake where Cremnoi stands; now Cremnoi is in\r\nthe land of the free Scythians. 109 There the Amazons disembarked from\r\ntheir ships and made their way into the country, and having met first\r\nwith a troop of horses feeding they seized them, and mounted upon these\r\nthey plundered the property of the Scythians.\r\n\r\n111. The Scythians meanwhile were not able to understand the matter,\r\nfor they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to\r\nwhich they belonged, but were in wonder as to whence they had come and\r\nthought that they were men, of an age corresponding to their appearance:\r\nand finally they fought a battle against them, and after the battle\r\nthe Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus\r\nthey discovered that they were women. They took counsel therefore and\r\nresolved by no means to go on trying to kill them, but to send against\r\nthem the youngest men from among themselves, making conjecture of the\r\nnumber so as to send just as many men as there were women. These were\r\ntold to encamp near them, and do whatsoever they should do; if however\r\nthe women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire\r\nbefore them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and\r\nencamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to\r\nhave children born from them.\r\n\r\n112. The young men accordingly were sent out and did that which had been\r\ncommanded them: and when the Amazons perceived that they had not come\r\nto do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached\r\nnearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons,\r\nhad nothing except their arms and their horses, and got their living, as\r\nthe Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty.\r\n\r\n113. Now the Amazons at midday used to scatter abroad either one by one\r\nor by two together, dispersing to a distance from one another to ease\r\nthemselves; and the Scythians also having perceived this did the same\r\nthing: and one of the Scythians came near to one of those Amazons who\r\nwere apart by themselves, and she did not repulse him but allowed him\r\nto lie with her: and she could not speak to him, for they did not\r\nunderstand one another's speech, but she made signs to him with her hand\r\nto come on the following day to the same place and to bring another with\r\nhim, signifying to him that there should be two of them, and that she\r\nwould bring another with her. The young man therefore, when he returned,\r\nreported this to the others; and on the next day he came himself to the\r\nplace and also brought another, and he found the Amazon awaiting him\r\nwith another in her company. Then hearing this the rest of the young men\r\nalso in their turn tamed for themselves the remainder of the Amazons;\r\n\r\n114, and after this they joined their camps and lived together, each man\r\nhaving for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first; and the\r\nmen were not able to learn the speech of the women, but the women came\r\nto comprehend that of the men. So when they understood one another,\r\nthe men spoke to the Amazons as follows: \"We have parents and we have\r\npossessions; now therefore let us no longer lead a life of this kind,\r\nbut let us go away to the main body of our people and dwell with them;\r\nand we will have you for wives and no others.\" They however spoke thus\r\nin reply: \"We should not be able to live with your women, for we and\r\nthey have not the same customs. We shoot with bows and hurl javelins and\r\nride horses, but the works of women we never learnt; whereas your women\r\ndo none of these things which we said, but stay in the waggons and work\r\nat the works of women, neither going out to the chase nor anywhither\r\nelse. We therefore should not be able to live in agreement with them:\r\nbut if ye desire to keep us for your wives and to be thought honest men,\r\ngo to your parents and obtain from them your share of the goods, and\r\nthen let us go and dwell by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n115. The young men agreed and did this; and when they had obtained the\r\nshare of the goods which belonged to them and had returned back to the\r\nAmazons, the women spoke to them as follows: \"We are possessed by fear\r\nand trembling to think that we must dwell in this place, having not\r\nonly separated you from your fathers, but also done great damage to your\r\nland. Since then ye think it right to have us as your wives, do this\r\ntogether with us,—come and let us remove from this land and pass over\r\nthe river Tanaïs and there dwell.\"\r\n\r\n116. The young men agreed to this also, and they crossed over the Tanaïs\r\nand made their way towards the rising sun for three days' journey from\r\nTanaïs, and also towards the North Wind for three days' journey from\r\nthe Maiotian lake: and having arrived at the place where they are now\r\nsettled, they took up their abode there: and from thenceforward the\r\nwomen of the Sauromatai practise their ancient way of living, going out\r\nregularly on horseback to the chase both in company with the men and\r\napart from them, and going regularly to war, and wearing the same dress\r\nas the men.\r\n\r\n117. And the Sauromatai make use of the Scythian tongue, speaking it\r\nbarbarously however from the first, since the Amazons did not learn it\r\nthoroughly well. As regards marriages their rule is this, that no maiden\r\nis married until she has slain a man of their enemies; and some of them\r\neven grow old and die before they are married, because they are not able\r\nto fulfil the requirement of the law.\r\n\r\n118. To the kings of these nations then, which have been mentioned\r\nin order, the messengers of the Scythians came, finding them gathered\r\ntogether, and spoke declaring to them how the Persian king, after having\r\nsubdued all things to himself in the other continent, had laid a bridge\r\nover the neck of the Bosphorus and had crossed over to that continent,\r\nand having crossed over and subdued the Thracians, was making a bridge\r\nover the river Ister, desiring to bring under his power all these\r\nregions also. \"Do ye therefore,\" they said, \"by no means stand aloof and\r\nallow us to be destroyed, but let us become all of one mind and oppose\r\nhim who is coming against us. If ye shall not do so, we on our part\r\nshall either be forced by necessity to leave our land, or we shall stay\r\nin it and make a treaty with the invader; for what else can we do if ye\r\nare not willing to help us? and for you after this 110 it will be in\r\nno respect easier; for the Persian has come not at all less against you\r\nthan against us, nor will it content him to subdue us and abstain from\r\nyou. And of the truth of that which we say we will mention a strong\r\nevidence: if the Persian had been making his expedition against us\r\nalone, because he desired to take vengeance for the former servitude,\r\nhe ought to have abstained from all the rest and to have come at once to\r\ninvade our land, and he would thus have made it clear to all that he\r\nwas marching to fight against the Scythians and not against the rest.\r\nIn fact however, ever since he crossed over to this continent, he has\r\ncompelled all who came in his way to submit to him, and he holds under\r\nhim now not only the other Thracians but also the Getai, who are our\r\nnearest neighbours.\"\r\n\r\n119. When the Scythians proposed this, the kings who had come from the\r\nvarious nations took counsel together, and their opinions were divided.\r\nThe kings of the Gelonians, of the Budinoi and of the Sauromatai agreed\r\ntogether and accepted the proposal that they should help the Scythians,\r\nbut those of the Agathyrsians, Neuroi, Androphagoi, Melanchlainoi and\r\nTauroi returned answer to the Scythians as follows: \"If ye had not been\r\nthe first to do wrong to the Persians and to begin war, then we should\r\nhave surely thought that ye were speaking justly in asking for those\r\nthings for which ye now ask, and we should have yielded to your request\r\nand shared your fortunes. As it is however, ye on the one hand made\r\ninvasion without us into their land, and bare rule over the Persians for\r\nso long a time as God permitted you; and they in their turn, since\r\nthe same God stirs them up, are repaying you with the like. As for us\r\nhowever, neither at that time did we do any wrong to these men nor now\r\nshall we attempt to do any wrong to them unprovoked: if however the\r\nPersians shall come against our land also, and do wrong first to us, we\r\nalso shall refuse to submit 111: but until we shall see this, we shall\r\nremain by ourselves, for we are of opinion that the Persians have come\r\nnot against us, but against those who were the authors of the wrong.\"\r\n\r\n120. When the Scythians heard this answer reported, they planned not to\r\nfight a pitched battle openly, since these did not join them as allies,\r\nbut to retire before the Persians and to drive away their cattle from\r\nbefore them, choking up with earth the wells and the springs of water by\r\nwhich they passed and destroying the grass from off the ground, having\r\nparted themselves for this into two bodies; and they resolved that the\r\nSauromatai should be added to one of their divisions, namely that over\r\nwhich Scopasis was king, and that these should move on, if the Persians\r\nturned in that direction, straight towards the river Tanaïs, retreating\r\nbefore him by the shore of the Maiotian lake; and when the Persian\r\nmarched back again, they should come after and pursue him. This was one\r\ndivision of their kingdom, appointed to go by the way which has been\r\nsaid; and the other two of the kingdoms, the large one over which\r\nIdanthyrsos was king, and the third of which Taxakis was king, were to\r\njoin together in one, with the Gelonians and the Budinoi added to them,\r\nand they also were to retire before the Persians one day's march in\r\nfront of them, going on out of their way and doing that which had been\r\nplanned. First they were to move on straight for the countries which had\r\nrefused to give their alliance, in order that they might involve these\r\nalso in the war, and though these had not voluntarily undertaken the war\r\nwith the Persians, they were to involve them in it nevertheless against\r\ntheir will; and after that they were to return to their own land and\r\nattack the enemy, if it should seem good to them in council so to do.\r\n\r\n121. Having formed this plan the Scythians went to meet the army of\r\nDareios, sending off the best of their horsemen before them as scouts;\r\nbut all 112 the waggons in which their children and their women lived\r\nthey sent on, and with them all their cattle (leaving only so much as\r\nwas sufficient to supply them with food), and charged them that they\r\nshould proceed continually towards the North Wind. These, I say, were\r\nbeing carried on before:\r\n\r\n122, but when the scouts who went in front of the Scythians discovered\r\nthe Persians distant about three days' march from Ister, then the\r\nScythians having discovered them continued to pitch their camp one day's\r\nmarch in front, destroying utterly that which grew from the ground: and\r\nwhen the Persians saw that the horsemen of the Scythians had made their\r\nappearance, they came after them following in their track, while the\r\nScythians continually moved on. After this, since they had directed\r\ntheir march towards the first of the divisions, the Persians continued\r\nto pursue towards the East and the river Tanaïs; and when the Scythians\r\ncrossed over the river Tanaïs, the Persians crossed over after them and\r\ncontinued still to pursue, until they had passed quite through the land\r\nof the Sauromatai and had come to that of the Budinoi.\r\n\r\n123. Now so long as the Persians were passing through Scythia and the\r\nland of the Sauromatai, they had nothing to destroy, seeing that the\r\nland was bare, 113 but when they invaded the land of the Budinoi,\r\nthen they fell in with the wooden wall, which had been deserted by the\r\nBudinoi and left wholly unoccupied, and this they destroyed by fire.\r\nHaving done so they continued to follow on further in the tracks of\r\nthe enemy, until they had passed through the whole of this land and had\r\narrived at the desert. This desert region is occupied by no men, and it\r\nlies above the land of the Budinoi, extending for a seven days' journey;\r\nand above this desert dwell the Thyssagetai, and four large rivers flow\r\nfrom them through the land of the Maiotians and run into that which is\r\ncalled the Maiotian lake, their names being as follows,—Lycos, Oaros,\r\nTanaïs, Syrgis. 114\r\n\r\n124. When therefore Dareios came to the desert region, he ceased from\r\nhis course and halted his army upon the river Oaros. Having so done he\r\nbegan to build eight large fortifications at equal distances from one\r\nanother, that is to say about sixty furlongs, of which the ruins\r\nstill existed down to my time; and while he was occupied in this,\r\nthe Scythians whom he was pursuing came round by the upper parts and\r\nreturned back to Scythia. Accordingly, since these had altogether\r\ndisappeared and were no longer seen by the Persians at all, Dareios left\r\nthose fortifications half finished, and turning back himself began to\r\ngo towards the West, supposing that these were the whole body of the\r\nScythians and that they were flying towards the West.\r\n\r\n125. And marching his army as quickly as possible, when he came to\r\nScythia he met with the two divisions of the Scythians together, and\r\nhaving fallen in with these he continued to pursue them, while they\r\nretired out of his way one day's journey in advance: and as Dareios did\r\nnot cease to come after them, the Scythians according to the plan which\r\nthey had made continued to retire before him towards the land of those\r\nwho had refused to give their alliance, and first towards that of the\r\nMelanchlainoi; and when Scythians and Persians both together had invaded\r\nand disturbed these, the Scythians led the way to the country of the\r\nAndrophagoi; and when these had also been disturbed, they proceeded to\r\nthe land of the Neuroi; and while these too were being disturbed, the\r\nScythians went on retiring before the enemy to the Agathyrsians. The\r\nAgathyrsians however, seeing that their next neighbours also were flying\r\nfrom the Scythians and had been disturbed, sent a herald before the\r\nScythians invaded their land and proclaimed to the Scythians not to set\r\nfoot upon their confines, warning them that if they should attempt\r\nto invade the country, they would first have to fight with them. The\r\nAgathyrsians then having given this warning came out in arms to their\r\nborders, meaning to drive off those who were coming upon them; but\r\nthe Melanchlainoi and Androphagoi and Neuroi, when the Persians and\r\nScythians together invaded them, did not betake themselves to brave\r\ndefence but forgot their former threat 115 and fled in confusion ever\r\nfurther towards the North to the desert region. The Scythians however,\r\nwhen the Agathyrsians had warned them off, did not attempt any more to\r\ncome to these, but led the Persians from the country of the Neuroi back\r\nto their own land.\r\n\r\n126. Now as this went on for a long time and did not cease, Dareios sent\r\na horseman to Idanthyrsos king of the Scythians and said as follows:\r\n\"Thou most wondrous man, why dost thou fly for ever, when thou mightest\r\ndo of these two things one?—if thou thinkest thyself able to make\r\nopposition to my power, stand thou still and cease from wandering\r\nabroad, and fight; but if thou dost acknowledge thyself too weak, cease\r\nthen in that case also from thy course, and come to speech with thy\r\nmaster, bringing to him gifts of earth and water.\"\r\n\r\n127. To this the king of the Scythians Idanthyrsos made answer thus: \"My\r\ncase, O Persian, stands thus:—Never yet did I fly because I was afraid,\r\neither before this time from any other man, or now from thee; nor have\r\nI done anything different now from that which I was wont to do also in\r\ntime of peace: and as to the cause why I do not fight with thee at once,\r\nthis also I will declare to thee. We have neither cities nor land sown\r\nwith crops, about which we should fear lest they should be captured\r\nor laid waste, and so join battle more speedily with you; but if it\r\nbe necessary by all means to come to this speedily, know that we have\r\nsepulchres in which our fathers are buried; therefore come now, find\r\nout these and attempt to destroy them, and ye shall know then whether we\r\nshall fight with you for the sepulchres or whether we shall not fight.\r\nBefore that however, unless the motion comes upon us, we shall not join\r\nbattle with thee. About fighting let so much as has been said suffice;\r\nbut as to masters, I acknowledge none over me but Zeus my ancestor and\r\nHestia the queen of the Scythians. To thee then in place of gifts of\r\nearth and water I shall send such things as it is fitting that thou\r\nshouldest receive; and in return for thy saying that thou art my master,\r\nfor that I say, woe betide thee.\" 116 This is the proverbial \"saying of\r\nthe Scythians.\" 117\r\n\r\n128. The herald then had departed to report this to Dareios; and the\r\nkings of the Scythians, having heard mention of subjection to a master,\r\nwere filled with wrath. They sent accordingly the division which was\r\nappointed to be joined with the Sauromatai, that division of which\r\nScopasis was in command, bidding them come to speech with the Ionians,\r\nnamely those who were guarding the bridge of the Ister, and meanwhile\r\nthey who were left behind resolved not to lead the Persians wandering\r\nabout any more, but to attack them constantly as they were getting\r\nprovisions. Therefore they observed the soldiers of Dareios as they got\r\nprovisions, and did that which they had determined: and the cavalry of\r\nthe Scythians always routed that of the enemy, but the Persian horsemen\r\nas they fled fell back upon the men on foot, and these would come up to\r\ntheir assistance; and meanwhile the Scythians when they had driven in\r\nthe cavalry turned back, fearing the men on foot. Also by night the\r\nScythians used to make similar attacks:\r\n\r\n129, and the thing which, strange to say, most helped the Persians and\r\nhindered the Scythians in their attacks upon the camp of Dareios, I will\r\nmention, namely the voice of the asses and the appearance of the mules;\r\nfor Scythia produces neither ass nor mule, as I have declared before,\r\nnor is there at all in the Scythian country either ass or mule on\r\naccount of the cold. The asses accordingly by riotously braying used to\r\nthrow into confusion the cavalry of the Scythians; and often, as they\r\nwere in the middle of riding against the Persians, when the horses heard\r\nthe voice of the asses they turned back in confusion and were possessed\r\nwith wonder, pricking up their ears, because they had never heard such a\r\nvoice nor seen the form of the creature before.\r\n\r\n130. So far then the Persians had the advantage for a small part of the\r\nwar. 118 But the Scythians, whenever they saw that the Persians were\r\ndisquieted, then in order that they might remain a longer time in\r\nScythia and in remaining might suffer by being in want of everything,\r\nwould leave some of their own cattle behind with the herdsmen, while\r\nthey themselves rode out of the way to another place, and the Persians\r\nwould come upon the cattle and take them, and having taken them they\r\nwere elated at what they had done.\r\n\r\n131. As this happened often, at length Dareios began to be in straits;\r\nand the kings of the Scythians perceiving this sent a herald bearing\r\nas gifts to Dareios a bird and a mouse and a frog and five arrows. The\r\nPersians accordingly asked the bearer of the gifts as to the meaning\r\nof the gifts which were offered; but he said that nothing more had been\r\ncommanded to him but to give them and get away as speedily as possible;\r\nand he bade the Persians find out for themselves, if they had wisdom,\r\nthat which the gifts were meant to express.\r\n\r\n132. Having heard this the Persians took counsel with one another; and\r\nthe opinion of Dareios was that the Scythians were giving to him both\r\nthemselves and also earth and water, making his conjecture by this,\r\nnamely that a mouse is produced in the earth and feeds on the same\r\nproduce of the earth as man, and a frog in the water, while a bird has\r\ngreat resemblance to a horse; 119 and moreover that in giving the arrows\r\nthey were delivering up their own might in battle. This was the opinion\r\nexpressed by Dareios; but the opinion of Gobryas, one of the seven men\r\nwho killed the Magian, was at variance with it, for he conjectured that\r\nthe gifts expressed this: \"Unless ye become birds and fly up into the\r\nheaven, O Persians, or become mice and sink down under the earth, or\r\nbecome frogs and leap into the lakes, ye shall not return back home, but\r\nshall be smitten by these arrows.\"\r\n\r\n133. The Persians then, I say, were making conjecture of the gifts:\r\nand meanwhile the single division of the Scythians, that which had been\r\nappointed at first to keep guard along the Maiotian lake and then to go\r\nto the Ister and come to speech with the Ionians, when they arrived\r\nat the bridge spoke as follows: \"Ionians, we have come bringing you\r\nfreedom, if at least ye are willing to listen to us; for we are informed\r\nthat Dareios gave you command to guard the bridge for sixty days only,\r\nand then, if he had not arrived within that time, to get you away to\r\nyour own land. Now therefore, if ye do as we say, ye will be without\r\nblame from his part and without blame also from ours: stay the appointed\r\ndays and then after that get you away.\" They then, when the Ionians had\r\nengaged themselves to do this, hastened back again by the quickest way:\r\n\r\n134, and meanwhile, after the coming of the gifts to Dareios, the\r\nScythians who were left had arrayed themselves against the Persians with\r\nboth foot and horse, meaning to engage battle. Now when the Scythians\r\nhad been placed in battle-array, a hare darted through them into the\r\nspace between the two armies, and each company of them, as they saw the\r\nhare, began to run after it. When the Scythians were thus thrown into\r\ndisorder and were raising loud cries, Dareios asked what was this\r\nclamour arising from the enemy; and hearing that they were running after\r\nthe hare, he said to those men to whom he was wont to say things at\r\nother times: \"These men have very slight regard for us, and I perceive\r\nnow that Gobryas spoke rightly about the Scythian gifts. Seeing then\r\nthat now I myself too think that things are so, we have need of good\r\ncounsel, in order that our retreat homewards may be safely made.\" To\r\nthis replied Gobryas and said: \"O king, even by report I was almost\r\nassured of the difficulty of dealing with these men; and when I came I\r\nlearnt it still more thoroughly, since I saw that they were mocking us.\r\nNow therefore my opinion is, that as soon as night comes on, we kindle\r\nthe camp-fires as we are wont to do at other times also, and deceive\r\nwith a false tale those of our men who are weakest to endure hardships,\r\nand tie up all the asses and get us away, before either the Scythians\r\nmake for the Ister to destroy the bridge or something be resolved by the\r\nIonians which may be our ruin.\"\r\n\r\n135. Thus Gobryas advised; and after this, when night came on, Dareios\r\nacted on this opinion. Those of his men who were weakened by fatigue and\r\nwhose loss was of least account, these he left behind in the camp, and\r\nthe asses also tied up: and for the following reasons he left behind the\r\nasses and the weaker men of his army,—the asses in order that they might\r\nmake a noise which should be heard, and the men really because of their\r\nweakness, but on a pretence stated openly that he was about to attack\r\nthe Scythians with the effective part of the army, and that they\r\nmeanwhile were to be defenders of the camp. Having thus instructed those\r\nwho were left behind, and having kindled camp-fires, Dareios hastened\r\nby the quickest way towards the Ister: and the asses, having no longer\r\nabout them the usual throng, 120 very much more for that reason caused\r\ntheir voice to be heard; 121 so the Scythians, hearing the asses,\r\nsupposed surely that the Persians were remaining in their former place.\r\n\r\n136. But when it was day, those who were left behind perceived that\r\nthey had been betrayed by Dareios, and they held out their hands in\r\nsubmission to the Scythians, telling them what their case was; and the\r\nScythians, when they heard this, joined together as quickly as possible,\r\nthat is to say the two combined divisions of the Scythians and the\r\nsingle division, and also the Sauromatai, 122 Budinoi, and Gelonians,\r\nand began to pursue the Persians, making straight for the Ister: but as\r\nthe Persian army for the most part consisted of men on foot, and was\r\nnot acquainted with the roads (the roads not being marked with tracks),\r\nwhile the Scythian army consisted of horsemen and was acquainted\r\nwith the shortest cuts along the way, they missed one another and the\r\nScythians arrived at the bridge much before the Persians. Then having\r\nlearnt that the Persians had not yet arrived, they said to the Ionians\r\nwho were in the ships: \"Ionians, the days of your number are past, and\r\nye are not acting uprightly in that ye yet remain waiting: but as ye\r\nstayed before from fear, so now break up the passage as quickly as ye\r\nmay, and depart free and unhurt, 123 feeling thankfulness both to the\r\ngods and to the Scythians: and him who was formerly your master we\r\nwill so convince, that he shall never again march with an army upon any\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\n137. Upon this the Ionians took counsel together; and Miltiades the\r\nAthenian on the one hand, who was commander and despot of the men of\r\nthe Chersonese in Hellespont, was of opinion that they should follow the\r\nadvice of the Scythians and set Ionia free: but Histiaios the Milesian\r\nwas of the opposite opinion to this; for he said that at the present\r\ntime it was by means of Dareios that each one of them was ruling as\r\ndespot over a city; and if the power of Dareios should be destroyed,\r\nneither he himself would be able to bear rule over the Milesians, nor\r\nwould any other of them be able to bear rule over any other city; for\r\neach of the cities would choose to have popular rather than despotic\r\nrule. When Histiaios declared his opinion thus, forthwith all turned to\r\nthis opinion, whereas at the first they were adopting that of Miltiades.\r\n\r\n138. Now these were they who gave the vote between the two opinions, and\r\nwere men of consequence in the eyes of the king, 124—first the despots\r\nof the Hellespontians, Daphnis of Abydos, Hippoclos of Lampsacos,\r\nHerophantos of Parion, Metrodoros of Proconnesos, Aristagoras of\r\nKyzicos, and Ariston of Byzantion, these were those from the Hellespont;\r\nand from Ionia, Strattis of Chios, Aiakes of Samos, Laodamas of Phocaia,\r\nand Histiaios of Miletos, whose opinion had been proposed in opposition\r\nto that of Miltiades; and of the Aiolians the only man of consequence\r\nthere present was Aristagoras of Kyme.\r\n\r\n139. When these adopted the opinion of Histiaios, they resolved to add\r\nto it deeds and words as follows, namely to break up that part of the\r\nbridge which was on the side towards the Scythians, to break it up, I\r\nsay, for a distance equal to the range of an arrow, both in order that\r\nthey might be thought to be doing something, though in fact they were\r\ndoing nothing, and for fear that the Scythians might make an attempt\r\nusing force and desiring to cross the Ister by the bridge: and in\r\nbreaking up that part of the bridge which was towards Scythia they\r\nresolved to say that they would do all that which the Scythians desired.\r\nThis they added to the opinion proposed, and then Histiaios coming forth\r\nfrom among them made answer to the Scythians as follows: \"Scythians, ye\r\nare come bringing good news, and it is a timely haste that ye make to\r\nbring it; and ye on your part give us good guidance, while we on ours\r\nrender to you suitable service. For, as ye see, we are breaking up the\r\npassage, and we shall show all zeal in our desire to be free: and while\r\nwe are breaking up the bridge, it is fitting that ye should be seeking\r\nfor those of whom ye speak, and when ye have found them, that ye should\r\ntake vengeance on them on behalf of us as well as of yourselves in such\r\nmanner as they deserve.\"\r\n\r\n140. The Scythians then, believing for the second time that the Ionians\r\nwere speaking the truth, turned back to make search for the Persians,\r\nbut they missed altogether their line of march through the land. Of this\r\nthe Scythians themselves were the cause, since they had destroyed the\r\npastures for horses in that region and had choked up with earth the\r\nsprings of water; for if they had not done this, it would have been\r\npossible for them easily, if they desired it, to discover the Persians:\r\nbut as it was, by those things wherein they thought they had taken their\r\nmeasures best, they failed of success. The Scythians then on their part\r\nwere passing through those regions of their own land where there was\r\ngrass for the horses and springs of water, and were seeking for the\r\nenemy there, thinking that they too were taking a course in their\r\nretreat through such country as this; while the Persians in fact marched\r\nkeeping carefully to the track which they had made before, and so they\r\nfound the passage of the river, though with difficulty: 125 and as they\r\narrived by night and found the bridge broken up, they were brought to\r\nthe extreme of fear, lest the Ionians should have deserted them.\r\n\r\n141. Now there was with Dareios an Egyptian who had a voice louder than\r\nthat of any other man on earth, and this man Dareios ordered to take his\r\nstand upon the bank of the Ister and to call Histiaios of Miletos. He\r\naccordingly proceeded to do so; and Histiaios, hearing the first hail,\r\nproduced all the ships to carry the army over and also put together the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n142. Thus the Persians escaped, and the Scythians in their search missed\r\nthe Persians the second time also: and their judgment of the Ionians is\r\nthat on the one hand, if they be regarded as free men, they are the most\r\nworthless and cowardly of all men, but on the other hand, if regarded\r\nas slaves, they are the most attached to their master and the least\r\ndisposed to run away of all slaves. This is the reproach which is cast\r\nagainst the Ionians by the Scythians.\r\n\r\n143. Dareios then marching through Thrace arrived at Sestos in the\r\nChersonese; and from that place, he passed over himself in his ships to\r\nAsia, but to command his army in Europe he left Megabazos a Persian, to\r\nwhom Dareios once gave honour by uttering in the land of Persia 126 this\r\nsaying:—Dareios was beginning to eat pomegranates, and at once when he\r\nopened the first of them, Artabanos his brother asked him of what he\r\nwould desire to have as many as there were seeds in the pomegranate: and\r\nDareios said that he would desire to have men like Megabazos as many as\r\nthat in number, rather than to have Hellas subject to him. In Persia, I\r\nsay, he honoured him by saying these words, and at this time he left him\r\nin command with eight myriads 127 of his army.\r\n\r\n144. This Megabazos uttered one saying whereby he left of himself an\r\nimperishable memory with the peoples of Hellespont: for being once at\r\nByzantion he heard that the men of Calchedon had settled in that region\r\nseventeen years before the Byzantians, and having heard it he said that\r\nthose of Calchedon at that time chanced to be blind; for assuredly they\r\nwould not have chosen the worse place, when they might have settled in\r\nthat which was better, if they had not been blind. This Megabazos it was\r\nwho was left in command at that time in the land of the Hellespontians,\r\nand he proceeded to subdue all who did not take the side of the Medes.\r\n\r\n145. He then was doing thus; and at this very same time a great\r\nexpedition was being made also against Libya, on an occasion which\r\nI shall relate when I have first related this which follows.—The\r\nchildren's children of those who voyaged in the Argo, having been driven\r\nforth by those Pelasgians who carried away at Brauron the women of the\r\nAthenians,—having been driven forth I say by these from Lemnos, had\r\ndeparted and sailed to Lacedemon, and sitting down on Mount Taÿgetos\r\nthey kindled a fire. The Lacedemonians seeing this sent a messenger to\r\ninquire who they were and from whence; and they answered the question\r\nof the messenger saying that they were Minyai and children of heroes who\r\nsailed in the Argo, for 128 these, they said, had put in to Lemnos and\r\npropagated the race of which they sprang. The Lacedemonians having heard\r\nthe story of the descent of the Minyai, sent a second time and asked for\r\nwhat purpose they had come into the country and were causing a fire to\r\nblaze. They said that they had been cast out by the Pelasgians, and were\r\ncome now to the land of their fathers, 129 for most just it was that\r\nthis should so be done; and they said that their request was to be\r\npermitted to dwell with these, having a share of civil rights and a\r\nportion allotted to them of the land. And the Lacedemonians were content\r\nto receive the Minyai upon the terms which they themselves desired,\r\nbeing most of all impelled to do this by the fact that the sons of\r\nTyndareus were voyagers in the Argo. So having received the Minyai they\r\ngave them a share of land and distributed them in the tribes; and they\r\nforthwith made marriages, and gave in marriage to others the women whom\r\nthey brought with them from Lemnos.\r\n\r\n146. However, when no very long time had passed, the Minyai forthwith\r\nbroke out into insolence, asking for a share of the royal power and also\r\ndoing other impious things: therefore the Lacedemonians resolved to put\r\nthem to death; and having seized them they cast them into a prison.\r\nNow the Lacedemonians put to death by night all those whom they put to\r\ndeath, but no man by day. When therefore they were just about to kill\r\nthem, the wives of the Minyai, being native Spartans and daughters\r\nof the first citizens of Sparta, entreated to be allowed to enter the\r\nprison and come to speech every one with her own husband: and they let\r\nthem pass in, not supposing that any craft would be practised by them.\r\nThey however, when they had entered, delivered to their husbands all the\r\ngarments which they were wearing, and themselves received those of their\r\nhusbands: thus the Minyai having put on the women's clothes went forth\r\nout of prison as women, and having escaped in this manner they went\r\nagain to Taÿgetos and sat down there.\r\n\r\n147. Now at this very same time Theras the son of Autesion, the son of\r\nTisamenos, the son of Thersander, the son of Polyneikes, was preparing\r\nto set forth from Lacedemon to found a settlement. This Theras, who was\r\nof the race of Cadmos, was mother's brother to the sons of Aristodemos,\r\nEurysthenes and Procles; and while these sons were yet children, Theras\r\nas their guardian held the royal power in Sparta. When however his\r\nnephews were grown and had taken the power into their hands, then\r\nTheras, being grieved that he should be ruled by others after he had\r\ntasted of rule himself, said that he would not remain in Lacedemon, but\r\nwould sail away to his kinsmen. Now there were in the island which\r\nis now called Thera, but formerly was called Callista, descendants\r\nof Membliaros the son of Poikiles, a Phenician: for Cadmos the son of\r\nAgenor in his search for Europa put in to land at the island which is\r\nnow called Thera; and, whether it was that the country pleased him when\r\nhe had put to land, or whether he chose to do so for any other reason,\r\nhe left in this island, besides other Phenicians, Membliaros also, of\r\nhis own kinsmen. These occupied the island called Callista for eight\r\ngenerations of men, before Theras came from Lacedemon.\r\n\r\n148. To these then, I say, Theras was preparing to set forth, taking\r\nwith him people from the tribes, and intending to settle together with\r\nthose who have been mentioned, not with any design to drive them out,\r\nbut on the contrary claiming them very strongly as kinfolk. And when\r\nthe Minyai after having escaped from the prison went and sat down on\r\nTaÿgetos, Theras entreated of the Lacedemonians, as they were proposing\r\nto put them to death, that no slaughter might take place, and at the\r\nsame time he engaged himself to take them forth out of the land. The\r\nLacedemonians having agreed to this proposal, he sailed away with three\r\nthirty-oared galleys to the descendants of Membliaros, not taking with\r\nhim by any means all the Minyai, but a few only; for the greater number\r\nof them turned towards the land of the Paroreatai and Caucones, and\r\nhaving driven these out of their country, they parted themselves\r\ninto six divisions and founded in their territory the following\r\ntowns,—Lepreon, Makistos, Phrixai, Pyrgos, Epion, Nudion; of these the\r\nEleians sacked the greater number within my own lifetime. The island\r\nmeanwhile got its name of Thera after Theras 130 who led the settlement.\r\n\r\n149. And since his son said that he would not sail with him, therefore\r\nhe said that he would leave him behind as a sheep among wolves; and in\r\naccordance with that saying this young man got the name of Oiolycos, 131\r\nand it chanced that this name prevailed over his former name: then from\r\nOiolycos was begotten Aigeus, after whom are called the Aigeidai, a\r\npowerful clan 132 in Sparta: and the men of this tribe, since their\r\nchildren did not live to grow up, established by the suggestion of an\r\noracle a temple to the Avenging Deities 133 of Laïos and OEdipus, and\r\nafter this the same thing was continued 134 in Thera by the descendants\r\nof these men.\r\n\r\n150. Up to this point of the story the Lacedemonians agree in their\r\nreport with the men of Thera; but in what is to come it is those of\r\nThera alone who report that it happened as follows. Grinnos 135 the son\r\nof Aisanios, a descendant of the Theras who has been mentioned, and\r\nking of the island of Thera, came to Delphi bringing the offering of a\r\nhecatomb from his State; and there were accompanying him, besides others\r\nof the citizens, also Battos the son of Polymnestos, who was by descent\r\nof the family of Euphemos 136 of the race of the Minyai. Now when\r\nGrinnos the king of the Theraians was consulting the Oracle about other\r\nmatters, the Pythian prophetess gave answer bidding him found a city in\r\nLibya; and he made reply saying: \"Lord, 137 I am by this time somewhat\r\nold and heavy to stir, but do thou bid some one of these younger ones do\r\nthis.\" As he thus said he pointed towards Battos. So far at that time:\r\nbut afterwards when he had come away they were in difficulty about the\r\nsaying of the Oracle, neither having any knowledge of Libya, in what\r\npart of the earth it was, nor venturing to send a colony to the unknown.\r\n\r\n151. Then after this for seven years there was no rain in Thera, and\r\nin these years all the trees in their island were withered up excepting\r\none: and when the Theraians consulted the Oracle, the Pythian prophetess\r\nalleged this matter of colonising Libya to be the cause. As then they\r\nhad no remedy for their evil, they sent messengers to Crete, to find out\r\nwhether any of the Cretans or of the sojourners in Crete had ever come\r\nto Libya. These as they wandered round about the country came also\r\nthe city of Itanos, and there they met with a fisher for purple named\r\nCorobios, who said that he had been carried away by winds and had come\r\nto Libya, and in Libya to the island of Platea. This man they persuaded\r\nby payment of money and took him to Thera, and from Thera there set sail\r\nmen to explore, at first not many in number; and Corobios having guided\r\nthem to this same island of Platea, they left Corobios there, leaving\r\nbehind with him provisions for a certain number of months, and sailed\r\nthemselves as quickly as possible to make report about the island to the\r\nmen of Thera.\r\n\r\n152. Since however these stayed away longer than the time appointed,\r\nCorobios found himself destitute; and after this a ship of Samos, of\r\nwhich the master was Colaios, while sailing to Egypt was carried out of\r\nits course and came to this island of Platea; and the Samians hearing\r\nfrom Corobios the whole story left him provisions for a year.\r\nThey themselves then put out to sea from the island and sailed on,\r\nendeavouring to reach Egypt but carried away continually by the East\r\nWind; and as the wind did not cease to blow, they passed through the\r\nPillars of Heracles and came to Tartessos, guided by divine providence.\r\nNow this trading-place was at that time untouched by any, so that when\r\nthese returned back home they made profit from their cargo greater than\r\nany other Hellenes of whom we have certain knowledge, with the exception\r\nat least of Sostratos the son of Laodamas the Eginetan, for with him it\r\nis not possible for any other man to contend. And the Samians set apart\r\nsix talents, the tenth part of their gains, and had a bronze vessel made\r\nlike an Argolic mixing-bowl with round it heads of griffins projecting\r\nin a row; and this they dedicated as an offering in the temple of Hera,\r\nsetting as supports under it three colossal statues of bronze seven\r\ncubits in height, resting upon their knees. By reason first of this\r\ndeed great friendship was formed by those of Kyrene and Thera with the\r\nSamians.\r\n\r\n153. The Theraians meanwhile, when they arrived at Thera after having\r\nleft Corobios in the island, reported that they had colonised an island\r\non the coast of Libya: and the men of Thera resolved to send one of\r\nevery two brothers selected by lot and men besides taken from all the\r\nregions of the island, which are seven in number; and further that\r\nBattos should be both their leader and their king. Thus then they sent\r\nforth two fifty-oared galleys to Platea.\r\n\r\n154. This is the report of the Theraians; and for the remainder of the\r\naccount from this point onwards the Theraians are in agreement with the\r\nmen of Kyrene: from this point onwards, I say, since in what concerns\r\nBattos the Kyrenians tell by no means the same tale as those of Thera;\r\nfor their account is this:—There is in Crete a city called Oäxos 138\r\nin which one Etearchos became king, who when he had a daughter,\r\nwhose mother was dead, named Phronime, took to wife another woman\r\nnotwithstanding. She having come in afterwards, thought fit to be a\r\nstepmother to Phronime in deed as well as in name, giving her evil\r\ntreatment and devising everything possible to her hurt; and at last she\r\nbrings against her a charge of lewdness and persuades her husband that\r\nthe truth is so. He then being convinced by his wife, devised an unholy\r\ndeed against the daughter: for there was in Oäxos one Themison, a\r\nmerchant of Thera, whom Etearchos took to himself as a guest-friend\r\nand caused him to swear that he would surely serve him in whatsoever he\r\nshould require: and when he had caused him to swear this, he brought and\r\ndelivered to him his daughter and bade him take her away and cast\r\nher into the sea. Themison then was very greatly vexed at the\r\ndeceit practised in the matter of the oath, and he dissolved his\r\nguest-friendship and did as follows, that is to say, he received the\r\ngirl and sailed away, and when he got out into the open sea, to free\r\nhimself from blame as regards the oath which Etearchos had made him\r\nswear, he tied her on each side with ropes and let her down into the\r\nsea, and then drew her up and came to Thera.\r\n\r\n155. After that, Polymnestos, a man of repute among the Theraians,\r\nreceived Phronime from him and kept her as his concubine; and in course\r\nof time there was born to him from her a son with an impediment in his\r\nvoice and lisping, to whom, as both Theraians and Kyrenians say, was\r\ngiven the name Battos, but I think that some other name was then given,\r\n139 and he was named Battos instead of this after he came to Libya,\r\ntaking for himself this surname from the oracle which was given to him\r\nat Delphi and from the rank which he had obtained; for the Libyans call\r\na king battos: and for this reason, I think, the Pythian prophetess in\r\nher prophesying called him so, using the Libyan tongue, because she knew\r\nthat he would be a king in Libya. For when he had grown to be a man,\r\nhe came to Delphi to inquire about his voice; and when he asked, the\r\nprophetess thus answered him:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"For a voice thou camest, O Battos, but thee lord Phoebus Apollo\r\n  Sendeth as settler forth to the Libyan land sheep-abounding,\"\r\n\r\njust as if she should say using the Hellenic tongue, \"For a voice thou\r\ncamest, O king.\" He thus made answer: \"Lord, I came to thee to inquire\r\nconcerning my voice, but thou answerest me other things which are not\r\npossible, bidding me go as a settler to Libya; but with what power,\r\nor with what force of men should I go?\" Thus saying he did not at all\r\npersuade her to give him any other reply; and as she was prophesying to\r\nhim again the same things as before, Battos departed while she was yet\r\nspeaking, 140 and went away to Thera.\r\n\r\n156. After this there came evil fortune both to himself and to the other\r\nmen of Thera; 141 and the Theraians, not understanding that which\r\nbefell them, sent to Delphi to inquire about the evils which they were\r\nsuffering: and the Pythian prophetess gave them reply that if they\r\njoined with Battos in founding Kyrene in Libya, they would fare the\r\nbetter. After this the Theraians sent Battos with two fifty-oared\r\ngalleys; and these sailed to Libya, and then came away back to Thera,\r\nfor they did not know what else to do: and the Theraians pelted them\r\nwith missiles when they endeavoured to land, and would not allow them\r\nto put to shore, but bade them sail back again. They accordingly being\r\ncompelled sailed away back, and they made a settlement in an island\r\nlying near the coast of Libya, called, as was said before, Platea.\r\nThis island is said to be of the same size as the now existing city of\r\nKyrene.\r\n\r\n157. In this they continued to dwell two years; but as they had no\r\nprosperity, they left one of their number behind and all the rest sailed\r\naway to Delphi, and having come to the Oracle they consulted it, saying\r\nthat they were dwelling in Libya and that, though they were dwelling\r\nthere, they fared none the better: and the Pythian prophetess made\r\nanswer to them thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Better than I if thou knowest the Libyan land sheep-abounding,\r\n  Not having been there than I who have been, at thy wisdom I wonder.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this Battos and his companions sailed away back again; for\r\nin fact the god would not let them off from the task of settlement till\r\nthey had come to Libya itself: and having arrived at the island and\r\ntaken up him whom they had left, they made a settlement in Libya itself\r\nat a spot opposite the island, called Aziris, which is enclosed by most\r\nfair woods on both sides and a river flows by it on one side.\r\n\r\n158. In this spot they dwelt for six years; and in the seventh year the\r\nLibyans persuaded them to leave it, making request and saying that they\r\nwould conduct them to a better region. So the Libyans led them from that\r\nplace making them start towards evening; and in order that the Hellenes\r\nmight not see the fairest of all the regions as they passed through it,\r\nthey led them past it by night, having calculated the time of daylight:\r\nand this region is called Irasa. Then having conducted them to the\r\nso-called spring of Apollo, they said, \"Hellenes, here is a fit place\r\nfor you to dwell, for here the heaven is pierced with holes.\"\r\n\r\n159. Now during the lifetime of the first settler Battos, who reigned\r\nforty years, and of his son Arkesilaos, who reigned sixteen years, the\r\nKyrenians continued to dwell there with the same number as 142 when they\r\nfirst set forth to the colony; but in the time of the third king, called\r\nBattos the Prosperous, the Pythian prophetess gave an oracle wherein\r\nshe urged the Hellenes in general to sail and join with the Kyrenians\r\nin colonising Libya. For the Kyrenians invited them, giving promise of a\r\ndivision of land; and the oracle which she uttered was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Who to the land much desirèd, to Libya, afterwards cometh,\r\n  After the land be divided, 143 I say he shall some day repent it.\"\r\n\r\nThen great numbers were gathered at Kyrene, and the Libyans who dwelt\r\nround had much land cut off from their possessions; therefore they with\r\ntheir king whose name was Adicran, as they were not only deprived of\r\ntheir country but also were dealt with very insolently by the Kyrenians,\r\nsent to Egypt and delivered themselves over to Apries king of Egypt. He\r\nthen having gathered a great army of Egyptians, sent it against Kyrene;\r\nand the men of Kyrene marched out to the region of Irasa and to the\r\nspring Theste, 144 and there both joined battle with the Egyptians and\r\ndefeated them in the battle: for since the Egyptians had not before made\r\ntrial of the Hellenes in fight and therefore despised them, they were so\r\nslaughtered that but few of them returned back to Egypt. In consequence\r\nof this and because they laid the blame of it upon Apries, the Egyptians\r\nrevolted from him.\r\n\r\n160. This Battos had a son called Arkesilaos, who first when he became\r\nking made a quarrel with his own brothers, until they finally departed\r\nto another region of Libya, and making the venture for themselves\r\nfounded that city which was then and is now called Barca; and at the\r\nsame time as they founded this, they induced the Libyans to revolt from\r\nthe Kyrenians. After this, Arkesilaos made an expedition against those\r\nLibyans who had received them and who had also revolted from Kyrene, and\r\nthe Libyans fearing him departed and fled towards the Eastern tribes\r\nof Libyans: and Arkesilaos followed after them as they fled, until\r\nhe arrived in his pursuit at Leucon in Libya, and there the Libyans\r\nresolved to attack him. Accordingly they engaged battle and defeated the\r\nKyrenians so utterly that seven thousand hoplites of the Kyrenians fell\r\nthere. After this disaster Arkesilaos, being sick and having swallowed a\r\npotion, was strangled by his brother Haliarchos, 145 and Haliarchos was\r\nkilled treacherously by the wife of Arkesilaos, whose name was Eryxo.\r\n\r\n161. Then Battos the son of Arkesilaos succeeded to the kingdom, who\r\nwas lame and not sound in his feet: and the Kyrenians with a view to the\r\nmisfortune which had befallen them sent men to Delphi to ask what form\r\nof rule they should adopt, in order to live in the best way possible;\r\nand the Pythian prophetess bade them take to themselves a reformer\r\nof their State from Mantineia of the Arcadians. The men of Kyrene\r\naccordingly made request, and those of Mantineia gave them the man\r\nof most repute among their citizens, whose name was Demonax. This\r\nman therefore having come to Kyrene and having ascertained all things\r\nexactly, 146 in the first place caused them to have three tribes,\r\ndistributing them thus:—one division he made of the Theraians and their\r\ndependants, 147 another of the Peloponnesians and Cretans, and a third\r\nof all the islanders. 148 Then secondly for the king Battos he set apart\r\ndomains of land and priesthoods, but all the other powers which the\r\nkings used to possess before, he assigned as of public right to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n162. During the reign of this Battos things continued to be thus, but in\r\nthe reign of his son Arkesilaos there arose much disturbance about\r\nthe offices of the State: for Arkesilaos son of Battos the Lame and\r\nof Pheretime said that he would not suffer it to be according as the\r\nMantineian Demonax had arranged, but asked to have back the royal rights\r\nof his forefathers. After this, stirring up strife he was worsted and\r\nwent as an exile to Samos, and his mother to Salamis in Cyprus. Now at\r\nthat time the ruler of Salamis was Euelthon, the same who dedicated as\r\nan offering the censer at Delphi, a work well worth seeing, which is\r\nplaced in the treasury of the Corinthians. To him having come, Pheretime\r\nasked him for an army to restore herself and her son to Kyrene. Euelthon\r\nhowever was ready to give her anything else rather than that; and she\r\nwhen she received that which he gave her said that this too was a fair\r\ngift, but fairer still would be that other gift of an army for which she\r\nwas asking. As she kept saying this to every thing which was given, at\r\nlast Euelthon sent out to her a present of a golden spindle and distaff,\r\nwith wool also upon it: and when Pheretime uttered again the same saying\r\nabout this present, Euelthon said that such things as this were given as\r\ngifts to women and not an army.\r\n\r\n163. Arkesilaos meanwhile, being in Samos, was gathering every one\r\ntogether by a promise of dividing land; and while a great host was being\r\ncollected, Arkesilaos set out to Delphi to inquire of the Oracle about\r\nreturning from exile: and the Pythian prophetess gave him this answer:\r\n\"For four named Battos and four named Arkesilaos, eight generations\r\nof men, Loxias grants to you to be kings of Kyrene, but beyond this he\r\ncounsels you not even to attempt it. Thou however must keep quiet when\r\nthou hast come back to thy land; and if thou findest the furnace full of\r\njars, heat not the jars fiercely, but let them go with a fair wind: if\r\nhowever thou heat the furnace fiercely, enter not thou into the place\r\nflowed round by water; for if thou dost thou shalt die, both thou and\r\nthe bull which is fairer than all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n164. Thus the Pythian prophetess gave answer to Arkesilaos; and he,\r\nhaving taken to him those in Samos, made his return to Kyrene; and when\r\nhe had got possession of the power, he did not remember the saying of\r\nthe Oracle but endeavoured to exact penalties from those of the opposite\r\nfaction for having driven him out. Of these some escaped out of the\r\ncountry altogether, but some Arkesilaos got into his power and sent them\r\naway to Cyprus to be put to death. These were driven out of their course\r\nto Cnidos, and the men of Cnidos rescued them and sent them away to\r\nThera. Some others however of the Kyrenians fled to a great tower\r\nbelonging to Aglomachos a private citizen, and Arkesilaos burnt them by\r\npiling up brushwood round. Then after he had done the deed he perceived\r\nthat the Oracle meant this, in that the Pythian prophetess forbade\r\nhim, if he found the jars in the furnace, to heat them fiercely; and he\r\nvoluntarily kept away from the city of the Kyrenians, fearing the death\r\nwhich had been prophesied by the Oracle and supposing that Kyrene was\r\nflowed round by water. 149 Now he had to wife a kinswoman of his own,\r\nthe daughter of the king of Barca whose name was Alazeir: to him he\r\ncame, and men of Barca together with certain of the exiles from Kyrene,\r\nperceiving him going about in the market-place, killed him, and also\r\nbesides him his father-in-law Alazeir. Arkesilaos accordingly, having\r\nmissed the meaning of the oracle, whether with his will or against his\r\nwill, fulfilled his own destiny.\r\n\r\n165. His mother Pheretime meanwhile, so long as Arkesilaos having worked\r\nevil for himself dwelt at Barca, herself held the royal power of her son\r\nat Kyrene, both exercising his other rights and also sitting in council:\r\nbut when she heard that her son had been slain in Barca, she departed\r\nand fled to Egypt: for she had on her side services done for Cambyses\r\nthe son of Cyrus by Arkesilaos, since this was the Arkesilaos who had\r\ngiven over Kyrene to Cambyses and had laid a tribute upon himself.\r\nPheretime then having come to Egypt sat down as a suppliant of Aryandes,\r\nbidding him help her, and alleging as a reason that it was on account\r\nof his inclination to the side of the Medes that her son had been slain.\r\n166. Now this Aryandes had been appointed ruler of the province of Egypt\r\nby Cambyses; and after the time of these events he lost his life because\r\nhe would measure himself with Dareios. For having heard and seen that\r\nDareios desired to leave behind him as a memorial of himself a thing\r\nwhich had not been made by any other king, he imitated him, until at\r\nlast he received his reward: for whereas Dareios refined gold and made\r\nit as pure as possible, and of this caused coins to be struck, Aryandes,\r\nbeing ruler of Egypt, did the same thing with silver; and even now the\r\npurest silver is that which is called Aryandic. Dareios then having\r\nlearnt that he was doing this put him to death, bringing against him\r\nanother charge of attempting rebellion.\r\n\r\n167. Now at the time of which I speak this Aryandes had compassion on\r\nPheretime and gave her all the troops that were in Egypt, both the\r\nland and the sea forces, appointing Amasis a Maraphian to command the\r\nland-army and Badres, of the race of the Pasargadai, to command the\r\nfleet: but before he sent away the army, Aryandes despatched a herald\r\nto Barca and asked who it was who had killed Arkesilaos; and the men of\r\nBarca all took it upon themselves, for they said they suffered formerly\r\nmany great evils at his hands. Having heard this, Aryandes at last sent\r\naway the army together with Pheretime. This charge then was the pretext\r\nalleged; but in fact the army was being sent out (as I believe) for the\r\npurpose of subduing Libya: for of the Libyans there are many nations of\r\nnations of various kinds, and but few of them are subject to the king,\r\nwhile the greater number paid no regard to Dareios.\r\n\r\n168. Now the Libyans have their dwelling as follows:—Beginning from\r\nEgypt, first of the Libyans are settled the Adyrmachidai, who practise\r\nfor the most part the same customs as the Egyptians, but wear clothing\r\nsimilar to that of the other Libyans. Their women wear a bronze ring\r\n150 upon each leg, and they have long hair on their heads, and when they\r\ncatch their lice, each one bites her own in retaliation and then throws\r\nthem away. These are the only people of the Lybians who do this; and\r\nthey alone display to the king their maidens when they are about to\r\nbe married, and whosoever of them proves to be pleasing to the king is\r\ndeflowered by him. These Adyrmachidai extend along the coast from Egypt\r\nas far as the port which is called Plynos.\r\n\r\n169. Next after these come the Giligamai, 151 occupying the country\r\ntowards the West as far as the island of Aphrodisias. In the space\r\nwithin this limit lies off the coast the island of Platea, where the\r\nKyrenians made their settlement; and on the coast of the mainland there\r\nis Port Menelaos, and Aziris, where the Kyrenians used to dwell. From\r\nthis point begins the silphion 152 and it extends along the coast from\r\nthe island of Platea as far as the entrance of the Syrtis. This nation\r\npractises customs nearly resembling those of the rest.\r\n\r\n170. Next to the Giligamai on the West are the Asbystai: 153 these dwell\r\nabove 154 Kyrene, and the Asbystai do not reach down the sea, for the\r\nregion along the sea is occupied by Kyrenians. These most of all the\r\nLibyans are drivers of four-horse chariots, and in the greater number of\r\ntheir customs they endeavour to imitate the Kyrenians.\r\n\r\n171. Next after the Asbystai on the West come the Auchisai: these dwell\r\nabove Barca and reach down to the sea by Euesperides: and in the middle\r\nof the country of the Auchisai dwell the Bacales, 155 a small tribe,\r\nwho reach down to the sea by the city of Taucheira in the territory of\r\nBarca: these practise the same customs as those above Kyrene.\r\n\r\n172. Next after these Auschisai towards the West come the Nasamonians,\r\na numerous race, who in the summer leave their flocks behind by the sea\r\nand go up to the region of Augila to gather the fruit of the date-palms,\r\nwhich grow in great numbers and very large and are all fruit-bearing:\r\nthese hunt the wingless locusts, and they dry them in the sun and then\r\npound them up, and after that they sprinkle them upon milk and drink\r\nthem. Their custom is for each man to have many wives, and they make\r\ntheir intercourse with them common in nearly the same manner as the\r\nMassagetai, 156 that is they set up a staff in front of the door and\r\nso have intercourse. When a Nasamonian man marries his first wife,\r\nthe custom is for the bride on the first night to go through the whole\r\nnumber of the guests having intercourse with them, and each man when he\r\nhas lain with her gives a gift, whatsoever he has brought with him from\r\nhis house. The forms of oath and of divination which they use are as\r\nfollows:—they swear by the men among themselves who are reported to have\r\nbeen the most righteous and brave, by these, I say, laying hands upon\r\ntheir tombs; and they divine by visiting the sepulchral mounds of their\r\nancestors and lying down to sleep upon them after having prayed; and\r\nwhatsoever thing the man sees in his dream, this he accepts. They\r\npractise also the exchange of pledges in the following manner, that is\r\nto say, one gives the other to drink from his hand, and drinks himself\r\nfrom the hand of the other; and if they have no liquid, they take of the\r\ndust from the ground and lick it.\r\n\r\n173. Adjoining the Nasamonians is the country of the Psylloi. These have\r\nperished utterly in the following manner:—The South Wind blowing upon\r\nthem dried up all their cisterns of water, and their land was waterless,\r\nlying all within the Syrtis. They then having taken a resolve by common\r\nconsent, marched in arms against the South Wind (I report that which is\r\nreported by the Libyans), and when they had arrived at the sandy tract,\r\nthe South Wind blew and buried them in the sand. These then having\r\nutterly perished, the Nasamonians from that time forward possess their\r\nland.\r\n\r\n174. Above these towards the South Wind in the region of wild beasts\r\ndwell the Garamantians, 157 who fly from every man and avoid the company\r\nof all; and they neither possess any weapon of war, nor know how to\r\ndefend themselves against enemies.\r\n\r\n175. These dwell above the Nasamonians; and next to the Nasamonians\r\nalong the sea coast towards the West come the Macai, who shave their\r\nhair so as to leave tufts, letting the middle of their hair grow long,\r\nbut round this on all sides shaving it close to the skin; and for\r\nfighting they carry shields made of ostrich skins. Through their land\r\nthe river Kinyps runs out into the sea, flowing from a hill called the\r\n\"Hill of the Charites.\" This Hill of the Charites is overgrown thickly\r\nwith wood, while the rest of Libya which has been spoken of before is\r\nbare of trees; and the distance from the sea to this hill is two hundred\r\nfurlongs.\r\n\r\n176. Next to these Macai are the Gindanes, whose women wear each of\r\nthem a number of anklets made of the skins of animals, for the following\r\nreason, as it is said:—for every man who has commerce with her she binds\r\non an anklet, and the woman who has most is esteemed the best, since she\r\nhas been loved by the greatest number of men.\r\n\r\n177. In a peninsula which stands out into the sea from the land of these\r\nGindanes dwell the Lotophagoi, who live by eating the fruit of the\r\nlotos only. Now the fruit of the lotos is in size like that of the\r\nmastich-tree, and in flavour 158 it resembles that of the date-palm. Of\r\nthis fruit the Lotophagoi even make for themselves wine.\r\n\r\n178. Next after the Lotophagoi along the sea-coast are the Machlyans,\r\nwho also make use of the lotos, but less than those above mentioned.\r\nThese extend to a great river named the river Triton, and this runs out\r\ninto a great lake called Tritonis, in which there is an island named\r\nPhla. About this island they say there was an oracle given to the\r\nLacedemonians that they should make a settlement in it.\r\n\r\n179. The following moreover is also told, namely that Jason, when\r\nthe Argo had been completed by him under Mount Pelion, put into it\r\na hecatomb and with it also 159 a tripod of bronze, and sailed round\r\nPelopponese, desiring to come to Delphi; and when in sailing he got near\r\nMalea, a North Wind seized his ship and carried it off to Libya, and\r\nbefore he caught sight of land he had come to be in the shoals of the\r\nlake Tritonis. Then as he was at a loss how he should bring his ship\r\nforth, the story goes that Triton appeared to him and bade Jason give\r\nhim the tripod, saying that he would show them the right course and let\r\nthem go away without hurt: and when Jason consented to it, then Triton\r\nshowed them the passage out between the shoals and set the tripod in his\r\nown temple, after having first uttered a prophecy over the tripod 160\r\nand having declared to Jason and his company the whole matter, namely\r\nthat whensoever one of the descendants of those who sailed with him in\r\nthe Argo should carry away this tripod, then it was determined by fate\r\nthat a hundred cities of Hellenes should be established about the lake\r\nTritonis. Having heard this the native Libyans concealed the tripod.\r\n\r\n180. Next to these Machlyans are the Auseans. These and the Machlyans\r\ndwell round the lake Tritonis, and the river Triton is the boundary\r\nbetween them: and while the Machlyans grow their hair long at the back\r\nof the head, the Auseans do so in front. At a yearly festival of Athene\r\ntheir maidens take their stand in two parties and fight against one\r\nanother with stones and staves, and they say that in doing so they are\r\nfulfilling the rites handed down by their fathers for the divinity who\r\nwas sprung from that land, whom we call Athene: and those of the maidens\r\nwho die of the wounds received they call \"false-maidens.\" But before\r\nthey let them begin the fight they do this:—all join together and equip\r\nthe maiden who is judged to be the fairest on each occasion, with a\r\nCorinthian helmet and with full Hellenic armour, and then causing her to\r\ngo up into a chariot they conduct her round the lake. Now I cannot tell\r\nwith what they equipped the maidens in old time, before the Hellenes\r\nwere settled near them; but I suppose that they used to be equipped\r\nwith Egyptian armour, for it is from Egypt that both the shield and the\r\nhelmet have come to the Hellenes, as I affirm. They say moreover that\r\nAthene is the daughter of Poseidon and of the lake Tritonis, and that\r\nshe had some cause of complaint against her father and therefore gave\r\nherself to Zeus, and Zeus made her his own daughter. Such is the story\r\nwhich these tell; and they have their intercourse with women in common,\r\nnot marrying but having intercourse like cattle: and when the child of\r\nany woman has grown big, he is brought before a meeting of the men held\r\nwithin three months of that time, 161 and whomsoever of the men the\r\nchild resembles, his son he is accounted to be.\r\n\r\n181. Thus then have been mentioned those nomad Libyans who live along\r\nthe sea-coast: and above these inland is the region of Libya which has\r\nwild beasts; and above the wild-beast region there stretches a raised\r\nbelt of sand, extending from Thebes of the Egyptians to the Pillars of\r\nHeracles. In this belt at intervals of about ten days' journey there are\r\nfragments of salt in great lumps forming hills, and at the top of each\r\nhill there shoots up from the middle of the salt a spring of water cold\r\nand sweet; and about the spring dwell men, at the furthest limit towards\r\nthe desert, and above the wild-beast region. First, at a distance of ten\r\ndays' journey from Thebes, are the Ammonians, whose temple is derived\r\nfrom that of the Theban Zeus, for the image of Zeus in Thebes also, as I\r\nhave said before, 162 has the head of a ram. These, as it chances, have\r\nalso other water of a spring, which in the early morning is warm; at the\r\ntime when the market fills, 163 cooler; when midday comes, it is quite\r\ncold, and then they water their gardens; but as the day declines, it\r\nabates from its coldness, until at last, when the sun sets, the water is\r\nwarm; and it continues to increase in heat still more until it reaches\r\nmidnight, when it boils and throws up bubbles; and when midnight passes,\r\nit becomes cooler gradually till dawn of day. This spring is called the\r\nfountain of the Sun.\r\n\r\n182. After the Ammonians, as you go on along the belt of sand, at an\r\ninterval again of ten days' journey there is a hill of salt like that\r\nof the Ammonians, and a spring of water, with men dwelling about it; and\r\nthe name of this place is Augila. To this the Nasamonians come year by\r\nyear to gather the fruit of the date-palms.\r\n\r\n183. From Augila at a distance again of ten days' journey there\r\nis another hill of salt and spring of water and a great number of\r\nfruit-bearing date-palms, as there are also in the other places: and\r\nmen dwell here who are called the Garmantians, a very great nation, who\r\ncarry earth to lay over the salt and then sow crops. From this point is\r\nthe shortest way to the Lotophagoi, for from these it is a journey\r\nof thirty days to the country of the Garmantians. Among them also are\r\nproduced the cattle which feed backwards; and they feed backwards for\r\nthis reason, because they have their horns bent down forwards, and\r\ntherefore they walk backwards as they feed; for forwards they cannot go,\r\nbecause the horns run into the ground in front of them; but in nothing\r\nelse do they differ from other cattle except in this and in the\r\nthickness and firmness to the touch 164 of their hide. These\r\nGaramantians of whom I speak hunt the \"Cave-dwelling\" 165 Ethiopians\r\nwith their four-horse chariots, for the Cave-dwelling Ethiopians are\r\nthe swiftest of foot of all men about whom we hear report made: and the\r\nCave-dwellers feed upon serpents and lizards and such creeping things,\r\nand they use a language which resembles no other, for in it they squeak\r\njust like bats.\r\n\r\n184. From the Garmantians at a distance again of ten days' journey there\r\nis another hill of salt and spring of water, and men dwell round\r\nit called Atarantians, who alone of all men about whom we know are\r\nnameless; for while all taken together have the name Atarantians,\r\neach separate man of them has no name given to him. These utter curses\r\nagainst the Sun when he is at his height, 166 and moreover revile him\r\nwith all manner of foul terms, because he oppresses them by his burning\r\nheat, both themselves and their land. After this at a distance of ten\r\ndays' journey there is another hill of salt and spring of water, and men\r\ndwell round it. Near this salt hill is a mountain named Atlas, which is\r\nsmall in circuit and rounded on every side; and so exceedingly lofty is\r\nit said to be, that it is not possible to see its summits, for clouds\r\nnever leave them either in the summer or in the winter. This the natives\r\nsay is the pillar of the heaven. After this mountain these men got their\r\nname, for they are called Atlantians; and it is said that they neither\r\neat anything that has life nor have any dreams.\r\n\r\n185. As far as these Atlantians I am able to mention in order the names\r\nof those who are settled in the belt of sand; but for the parts beyond\r\nthese I can do so no more. However, the belt extends as far as the\r\nPillars of Heracles and also in the parts outside them: and there is\r\na mine of salt in it at a distance of ten days' journey from the\r\nAtlantians, and men dwelling there; and these all have their houses\r\nbuilt of the lumps of salt, since these parts of Libya which we have now\r\nreached 167 are without rain; for if it rained, the walls being made of\r\nsalt would not be able to last: and the salt is dug up there both white\r\nand purple in colour. 168 Above the sand-belt, in the parts which are in\r\nthe direction of the South Wind and towards the interior of Libya, the\r\ncountry is uninhabited, without water and without wild beasts, rainless\r\nand treeless, and there is no trace of moisture in it.\r\n\r\n186. I have said that from Egypt as far as the lake Tritonis Libyans\r\ndwell who are nomads, eating flesh and drinking milk; and these do not\r\ntaste at all of the flesh of cows, for the same reason as the Egyptians\r\nalso abstain from it, nor do they keep swine. Moreover the women of\r\nthe Kyrenians too think it not right to eat cows' flesh, because of the\r\nEgyptian Isis, and they even keep fasts and celebrate festivals for her;\r\nand the women of Barca, in addition from cows' flesh, do not taste of\r\nswine either.\r\n\r\n187. Thus it is with these matters: but in the region to the West of\r\nlake Tritonis the Libyans cease to be nomads, and they do not practise\r\nthe same customs, nor do to their children anything like that which\r\nthe nomads are wont to do; for the nomad Libyans, whether all of them\r\nI cannot say for certain, but many of them, do as follows:—when their\r\nchildren are four years old, they burn with a greasy piece of sheep's\r\nwool the veins in the crowns of their heads, and some of them burn\r\nthe veins of the temples, so that for all their lives to come the cold\r\nhumour may not run down from their heads and do them hurt: and for this\r\nreason it is (they say) that they are so healthy; for the Libyans are in\r\ntruth the most healthy of all races concerning which we have knowledge,\r\nwhether for this reason or not I cannot say for certain, but the most\r\nhealthy they certainly are: and if, when they burn the children, a\r\nconvulsion comes on, they have found out a remedy for this; for they\r\npour upon them the water of a he-goat and so save them. I report that\r\nwhich is reported by the Libyans themselves.\r\n\r\n188. The following is the manner of sacrifice which the nomads\r\nhave:—they cut off a part of the animal's ear as a first offering and\r\nthrow it over the house, 169 and having done this they twist its neck.\r\nThey sacrifice only to the Sun and the Moon; that is to say, to these\r\nall the Libyans sacrifice, but those who dwell round the lake Tritonis\r\nsacrifice most of all to Athene, and next to Triton and Poseidon.\r\n\r\n189. It would appear also that the Hellenes made the dress and the aigis\r\nof the images of Athene after the model of the Libyan women; for except\r\nthat the dress of the Libyan women is of leather, and the tassels which\r\nhang from their aigis are not formed of serpents but of leather thongs,\r\nin all other respects Athene is dressed like them. Moreover the name too\r\ndeclares that the dress of the figures of Pallas has come from Libya,\r\nfor the Libyan women wear over their other garments bare goat-skins\r\n(aigeas) with tasselled fringes and coloured over with red madder, and\r\nfrom the name of these goat-skins the Hellenes formed the name aigis.\r\nI think also that in these regions first arose the practice of crying\r\naloud during the performance of sacred rites, for the Libyan women do\r\nthis very well. 170 The Hellenes learnt from the Libyans also the yoking\r\ntogether of four horses.\r\n\r\n190. The nomads bury those who die just in the same manner as the\r\nHellenes, except only the Nasamonians: these bury bodies in a sitting\r\nposture, taking care at the moment when the man expires to place\r\nhim sitting and not to let him die lying down on his back. They have\r\ndwellings composed of the stems of asphodel entwined with rushes, and\r\nso made that they can be carried about. Such are the customs followed by\r\nthese tribes.\r\n\r\n191. On the West of the river Triton next after the Auseans come Libyans\r\nwho are tillers of the soil, and whose custom it is to possess fixed\r\nhabitations; and they are called Maxyans. They grow their hair long on\r\nthe right side of their heads and cut it short upon the left, and smear\r\ntheir bodies over with red ochre. These say that they are of the men who\r\ncame from Troy.\r\n\r\nThis country and the rest of Libya which is towards the West is both\r\nmuch more frequented by wild beasts and much more thickly wooded than\r\nthe country of the nomads: for whereas the part of Libya which is\r\nsituated towards the East, where the nomads dwell, is low-lying and\r\nsandy up to the river Triton, that which succeeds it towards the West,\r\nthe country of those who till the soil, is exceedingly mountainous and\r\nthickly-wooded and full of wild beasts: for in the land of these are\r\nfound both the monstrous serpent and the lion and the elephant, and\r\nbears and venomous snakes and horned asses, besides the dog-headed men,\r\nand the headless men with their eyes set in their breasts (at least\r\nso say the Libyans about them), and the wild men and wild women, and a\r\ngreat multitude of other beasts which are not fabulous like these. 171\r\n\r\n192. In the land of the nomads however there exist none of these, but\r\nother animals as follows:—white-rump antelopes, gazelles, buffaloes,\r\nasses, not the horned kind but others which go without water (for in\r\nfact these never drink), oryes, 172 whose horns are made into the sides\r\nof the Phenician lyre (this animal is in size about equal to an ox),\r\nsmall foxes, hyenas, porcupines, wild rams, wolves, 173 jackals,\r\npanthers, boryes, land-crocodiles about three cubits in length and very\r\nmuch resembling lizards, ostriches, and small snakes, each with one\r\nhorn: these wild animals there are in this country, as well as those\r\nwhich exist elsewhere, except the stag and the wild-boar; but Libya has\r\nno stags nor wild boars at all. Also there are in this country three\r\nkinds of mice, one is called the \"two-legged\" mouse, another the zegeris\r\n(a name which is Libyan and signifies in the Hellenic tongue a \"hill\"),\r\nand a third the \"prickly\" mouse. 174 There are also weasels produced in\r\nthe silphion, which are very like those of Tartessos. Such are the wild\r\nanimals which the land of the Libyans possesses, so far as we were able\r\nto discover by inquiries extended as much as possible.\r\n\r\n193. Next to the Maxyan Libyans are the Zauekes, 175 whose women drive\r\ntheir chariots for them to war.\r\n\r\n194. Next to these are the Gyzantes, 176 among whom honey is made in\r\ngreat quantity by bees, but in much greater quantity still it is said\r\nto be made by men, who work at it as a trade. However that may be, these\r\nall smear themselves over with red ochre and eat monkeys, which are\r\nproduced in very great numbers upon their mountains.\r\n\r\n195. Opposite these, as the Carthaginians say, there lies an island\r\ncalled Kyrauis, two hundred furlongs in length but narrow, to which one\r\nmay walk over from the mainland; and it is full of olives and vines.\r\nIn it they say there is a pool, from which the native girls with birds'\r\nfeathers smeared over with pitch bring up gold-dust out of the mud.\r\nWhether this is really so I do not know, but I write that which is\r\nreported; and nothing is impossible, 177 for even in Zakynthos I saw\r\nmyself pitch brought up out of a pool of water. There are there several\r\npools, and the largest of them measures seventy feet each way and is\r\ntwo fathoms in depth. Into this they plunge a pole with a myrtle-branch\r\nbound to it, and then with the branch of the myrtle they bring up pitch,\r\nwhich has the smell of asphalt, but in other respects it is superior to\r\nthe pitch of Pieria. This they pour into a pit dug near the pool; and\r\nwhen they have collected a large quantity, then they pour it into the\r\njars from the pit: and whatever thing falls into the pool goes under\r\nground and reappears in the sea, which is distant about four furlongs\r\nfrom the pool. Thus then the report about the island lying near the\r\ncoast of Libya is also probably enough true.\r\n\r\n196. The Carthaginians say also this, namely that there is a place in\r\nLibya and men dwelling there, outside the Pillars of Heracles, to whom\r\nwhen they have come and have taken the merchandise forth from their\r\nships, they set it in order along the beach and embark again in their\r\nships, and after that they raise a smoke; and the natives of the country\r\nseeing the smoke come to the sea, and then they lay down gold as an\r\nequivalent for the merchandise and retire to a distance away from the\r\nmerchandise. The Carthaginians upon that disembark and examine it,\r\nand if the gold is in their opinion sufficient for the value of the\r\nmerchandise, they take it up and go their way; but if not, they\r\nembark again in their ships and sit there; and the others approach and\r\nstraightway add more gold to the former, until they satisfy them:\r\nand they say that neither party wrongs the other; for neither do the\r\nCarthaginians lay hands on the gold until it is made equal to the value\r\nof their merchandise, nor do the others lay hands on the merchandise\r\nuntil the Carthaginians have taken the gold.\r\n\r\n197. These are the Libyan tribes whom we are able to name; and of these\r\nthe greater number neither now pay any regard to the king of the Medes\r\nnor did they then. Thus much also I have to say about this land, namely\r\nthat it is occupied by four races and no more, so far as we know; and\r\nof these races two are natives of the soil and the other two not so; for\r\nthe Libyans and the Ethiopians are natives, the one race dwelling in\r\nthe Northern parts of Libya and the other in the Southern, while the\r\nPhenicians and the Hellenes are strangers.\r\n\r\n198. I think moreover that (besides other things) in goodness of soil\r\nLibya does not very greatly excel 178 as compared with Asia or Europe,\r\nexcept only the region of Kinyps, for the same name is given to the land\r\nas to the river. This region is equal to the best of lands in bringing\r\nforth the fruit of Demeter, 179 nor does it at all resemble the rest of\r\nLibya; for it has black soil and is watered by springs, and neither has\r\nit fear of drought nor is it hurt by drinking too abundantly of rain;\r\nfor rain there is in this part of Libya. Of the produce of the crops\r\nthe same measures hold good here as for the Babylonian land. And that is\r\ngood land also which the Euesperites occupy, for when it bears best it\r\nproduces a hundred-fold, but the land in the region of Kinyps produces\r\nsometimes as much as three-hundred-fold.\r\n\r\n199. Moreover the land of Kyrene, which is the highest land of the part\r\nof Libya which is occupied by nomads, has within its confines three\r\nseasons of harvest, at which we may marvel: for the parts by the\r\nsea-coasts first have their fruits ripe for reaping and for gathering\r\nthe vintage; and when these have been gathered in, the parts which lie\r\nabove the sea-side places, those situated in the middle, which they call\r\nthe hills, 180 are ripe for the gathering in; and as soon as this middle\r\ncrop has been gathered in, that in the highest part of the land comes\r\nto perfection and is ripe; so that by the time the first crop has been\r\neaten and drunk up, the last is just coming in. Thus the harvest for the\r\nKyrenians lasts eight months. Let so much as has been said suffice for\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n200. Now when the Persian helpers of Pheretime, 181 having been sent\r\nfrom Egypt by Aryandes, had arrived at Barca, they laid siege to the\r\ncity, proposing to the inhabitants that they should give up those who\r\nwere guilty of the murder of Arkesilaos: but as all their people had\r\ntaken a share in the guilt, they did not accept the proposals. Then they\r\nbesieged Barca for nine months, both digging underground passages which\r\nled to the wall and making vigorous attacks upon it. Now the passages\r\ndug were discovered by a worker of bronze with a shield covered over\r\nwith bronze, who had thought of a plan as follows:—carrying it round\r\nwithin the wall he applied it to the ground in the city, and whereas\r\nthe other places to which he applied it were noiseless, at those places\r\nwhere digging was going on the bronze of the shield gave a sound; and\r\nthe men of Barca would make a countermine there and slay the Persians\r\nwho were digging mines. This then was discovered as I have said, and the\r\nattacks were repulsed by the men of Barca.\r\n\r\n201. Then as they were suffering hardship for a long time and many were\r\nfalling on both sides, and especially on that of the Persians, Amasis\r\nthe commander of the land-army contrived as follows:—perceiving that the\r\nBarcaians were not to be conquered by force but might be conquered by\r\nguile, he dug by night a broad trench and over it he laid timber of no\r\ngreat strength, and brought earth and laid it above on the top of the\r\ntimber, making it level with the rest of the ground: then at daybreak he\r\ninvited the men of Barca to a parley; and they gladly consented, and\r\nat last they agreed to make a treaty: and the treaty they made with one\r\nanother was taken over the hidden trench, namely that so long as this\r\nearth should continue to be as it was, so long the oath should remain\r\nfirm, and that the men of Barca should promise to pay tribute of due\r\namount to the king, and the Persians should do no further violence to\r\nthe men of Barca. 182 After the oath the men of Barca trusting to these\r\nengagements both went forth themselves from their city and let any who\r\ndesired it of the enemy pass within their walls, having opened all the\r\ngates; but the Persians first broke down the concealed bridge and then\r\nbegan to run inside the city wall. And the reason why they broke down\r\nthe bridge which they had made was that they might keep their oaths,\r\nsince they had sworn to the men of Barca that the oath should remain\r\nfirm continually for so long time as the earth should remain as it then\r\nwas, but after that they had broken it down, the oath no longer remained\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n202. Now the most guilty of the Barcaians, when they were delivered to\r\nher by the Persians, Pheretime impaled in a ring round about the wall;\r\nand she cut off the breasts of their wives and set the wall round with\r\nthese also in order: but the rest of the men of Barca she bade the\r\nPersians carry off as spoil, except so many of them as were of the\r\nhouse of Battos and not sharers in the guilt of the murder; and to these\r\nPheretime gave the city in charge.\r\n\r\n203. So the Persians having made slaves of the rest of the Barcaians\r\ndeparted to go back: and when they appeared at the gates of the city of\r\nKyrene, the Kyrenians let them go through their town in order to avoid\r\nneglect of some oracle. Then as the army was going through, Badres the\r\ncommander of the fleet urged that they should capture the city, but\r\nAmasis the commander of the land-army would not consent to it; for\r\nhe said that they had been sent against no other city of the Hellenes\r\nexcept Barca. When however they had passed through and were encamping on\r\nthe hill of Zeus Lycaios, they repented of not having taken possession\r\nof Kyrene; and they endeavoured again to pass into it, but the men of\r\nKyrene would not allow them. Then upon the Persians, although no one\r\nfought against them, there fell a sudden panic, and they ran away for\r\nabout sixty furlongs and then encamped. And when the camp had been\r\nplaced here, there came to it a messenger from Aryandes summoning them\r\nback; so the Persians asked the Kyrenians to give them provisions for\r\ntheir march and obtained their request; and having received these, they\r\ndeparted to go to Egypt. After this the Libyans took them up, 183 and\r\nkilled for the sake of their clothes and equipment those of them who\r\nat any time were left or straggled behind, until at last they came to\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n204. This army of the Persians reached Euesperides, and this was their\r\nfurthest point in Libya: and those of the Barcaians whom they had\r\nreduced to slavery they removed again from Egypt and brought them to\r\nthe king, and king Dareios gave them a village in the land of Bactria in\r\nwhich to make a settlement. To this village they gave the name of Barca,\r\nand it still continued to be inhabited by them even down to my own time,\r\nin the land of Bactria.\r\n\r\n205. Pheretime however did not bring her life happily to an end any more\r\nthan they: for as soon as she had returned from Libya to Egypt after\r\nhaving avenged herself on the Barcaians, she died an evil death, having\r\nbecome suddenly full of worms while yet alive: for, as it seems, too\r\nsevere punishments inflicted by men prove displeasing 184 to the gods.\r\nSuch and so great was the punishment inflicted by Pheretime the wife of\r\nBattos on the men of Barca.\r\n\r\n—————\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOOK IV.\r\n\r\n1 [ Some enterprises had been entrusted to others, e.g. the attack\r\non Samos; but this had not been the case with the capture of Babylon,\r\ntherefore some Editors have proposed corrections, e.g. {au tou}\r\n(Schweighäuser), and {autika} (Stein).]\r\n\r\n2 [ See i. 106.]\r\n\r\n3 [ {tes ano 'Asies}: this means Eastern Asia as distinguished from the\r\ncoasts of Asia Minor; see i. 103 and 177.]\r\n\r\n4 [ {katapausantes}: the expression is awkward if meant to be equivalent\r\nto {kai katepausan}, but it is hardly improved by the alteration to\r\n{katapausontes}.

For the use of {me} after {pheugein} cp. ii. 91.]\r\n\r\n75 [ Or, according to some MSS., \"as they proved in the case of\r\nAnacharsis and afterwards of Skyles\".]\r\n\r\n76 [ {gen pollen}.]\r\n\r\n77 [ {epitropou}.]\r\n\r\n78 [ {peplastai}: some authorities give {pepaistai}, \"has been invented\r\nas a jest\".]\r\n\r\n79 [ {es kheiras agesthai}.]\r\n\r\n7901 [ {o theos}.]\r\n\r\n80 [ {diepresteuse}: this or {epresteuse} is the reading of most of the\r\nMSS. The meaning is uncertain, since the word does not occur elsewhere.\r\nStein suggests that it may mean \"scoffed (at the Scythians)\". Various\r\nconjectures have been tried, e.g. {diedresteuse}, {diedrepeteuse}, etc.]\r\n\r\n81 [ {os Skuthas einai}: cp. ii. 8. Some (e.g. Dindorf and Bähr)\r\ntranslate \"considering that they are Scythians,\" i.e. for a nation so\r\nfamous and so widely extended.]\r\n\r\n82 [ i.e. about 5300 gallons.]\r\n\r\n83 [ {epi to iro}: the MSS. mostly have {epi iro}, and Stein adopts the\r\nconjecture {epi rio}, \"on a projecting point\". The temple would be that\r\nof {Zeus ourios} mentioned in ch. 87. (In the Medicean MS. the omitted\r\n{i} is inserted above the line beforethe {r}, not directly over it, as\r\nrepresented by Stein, and the accent is not omitted.)]\r\n\r\n84 [ {stadioi}, and so throughout.]\r\n\r\n85 [ i.e. 1,110,000.]\r\n\r\n86 [ i.e. 330,000.]\r\n\r\n8601 [ {stelas}, i.e. \"square blocks\"; so also in ch. 91.]\r\n\r\n87 [ i.e. 700,000.]\r\n\r\n8701 [ {os emoi dokeei sumballomeno}, \"putting the evidence together\".]\r\n\r\n88 [ {pasi deka}: probably a loose expression like {ta panta muria},\r\niii. 74.]\r\n\r\n89 [ {psoren}, \"mange\".]\r\n\r\n90 [ Or (less probably) \"Skyrmiadai\".]\r\n\r\n91 [ {Salmoxin}: some inferior MSS. have {Zalmoxin}, or {Zamolxin}, and\r\nthe spelling in other writers varies between these forms.]\r\n\r\n92 [ {daimona}, sometimes used for deified men as distinguished from\r\ngods, cp. ch. 103.]\r\n\r\n93 [ {dia penteteridos}.]\r\n\r\n94 [ {bathutera}.]\r\n\r\n95 [ {ou to asthenestato sophiste}. No depreciation seems to be intended\r\nhere.]\r\n\r\n96 [ {andreona}.]\r\n\r\n97 [ i.e. the Mediterranean: or the passage may mean simply, \"Thrace\r\nruns out further into the sea than Scythia\".]\r\n\r\n98 [ {gounon}.]\r\n\r\n99 [ More literally, \"I say this, so far as it is allowed to compare,\r\netc. Such is the form of the Tauric land\".]\r\n\r\n100 [ {ede}. The Agathyrsians however have not been mentioned before in\r\nthis connection.]\r\n\r\n101 [ {stadia}.]\r\n\r\n102 [ {tes Skuthikes ta epikarsia}, i.e. the lines running from West to\r\nEast.]\r\n\r\n103 [ {epanakhthentes}: so the Medicean MS. and another: the rest have\r\n{epanakhthentas}. Some Editors read by conjecture {apeneikhthentas},\r\n\"cast away on their coast\".]\r\n\r\n104 [ {neoisi}.]\r\n\r\n105 [ {trieteridas}.]\r\n\r\n106 [ Or, \"were driven out\".]\r\n\r\n107 [ {phtheirotrageousi}.]\r\n\r\n108 [ Or, \"Aiorpata,\" and \"aior\" below.]\r\n\r\n109 [ i.e. the Royal Scythians: see ch. 20.]\r\n\r\n110 [ {epi touto}, the reading of the Aldine edition. The MSS. have {epi\r\ntouto}. Stein suggests {dia touto}.]\r\n\r\n111 [ {ou peisometha}: some MSS. read {ouk oisometha}. Editors have\r\nemended by conjecture in various ways, e.g. {ou periopsometha}, \"we\r\nshall not allow it\"; {oi epoisometha} or {oi epeisometha}, \"we shall go\r\nout to attack him\"; {aposometha}, \"we shall repel him\".]\r\n\r\n112 [ {paras}, or {pasai}, belonging to {gunaikes}.]\r\n\r\n113 [ {khersou}, \"dry\".]\r\n\r\n114 [ Perhaps the same as the \"Hyrgis\" mentioned in ch. 57. Some Editors\r\nread \"Hyrgis\" in this passage.]\r\n\r\n115 [ See ch. 119.]\r\n\r\n116 [ {klaiein lego}.]\r\n\r\n117 [ {touto esti e apo Skutheon resis}: this refers to the last words,\r\n{klaiein lego}. Most Editors have doubts about the genuineness of the\r\nsentence, regarding it a marginal gloss which has crept into the text;\r\nbut perhaps without sufficient reason.]\r\n\r\n118 [ Or, \"with some slight effect on the course of the war\".]\r\n\r\n119 [ See i. 216.]\r\n\r\n120 [ {eremothentes tou omilou}.]\r\n\r\n121 [ {iesan tes phones}.]\r\n\r\n122 [ {e mia kai Sauromatai}: some Editors read {e meta Sauromateon}.\r\nThe MSS. give {e mia Sauromatai} (some {Sauromateon}). Stein inserts\r\n{kai}.]\r\n\r\n123 [ {khairontes eleutheroi}.]\r\n\r\n124 [ The list includes only those who voted in favour of the proposal\r\nof Histiaios (i.e. Miltiades is not included in it): hence perhaps Stein\r\nis right in suggesting some change in the text, e.g. {oi diapherontes te\r\nten psephon basileos kai eontes logou pleistou}. The absence of the\r\nname of Coës is remarked by several commentators, who forget that he had\r\naccompanied Dareios: see ch. 97.]\r\n\r\n125 [ Or, \"and even so they found the passage of the river with\r\ndifficulty\".]\r\n\r\n126 [ {en Persesi}.]\r\n\r\n127 [ i.e. 80,000.]\r\n\r\n128 [ {gar}: some MSS. read {de}; so Stein and other Editors.]\r\n\r\n129 [ i.e. Castor and Polydeukes the sons of Tyndareus, who were among\r\nthe Argonauts.]\r\n\r\n130 [ {Phera} (genitive).]\r\n\r\n131 [ From {ois} \"sheep\" and {lukos} \"wolf\" ({oin en lukoisi}).]\r\n\r\n132 [ {phule}, the word being here apparently used loosely.]\r\n\r\n133 [ {'Erinuon}.]\r\n\r\n134 [ {meta touto upemeine touto touto}: some Editors mark a lacuna\r\nafter {upemeine}, or supply some words like {sunebe de}: \"after this the\r\nchildren survived, and the same thing happened also in Thera, etc\".]\r\n\r\n135 [ Or, \"Grinos\".]\r\n\r\n136 [ {Euphemides}: the MSS. have {Euthumides}: the correction is from\r\nPindar, Pyth. iv. 455.]\r\n\r\n137 [ {onax}, the usual form of address to Apollo; so in ch. 155.]\r\n\r\n138 [ Or, \"Axos\".]\r\n\r\n139 [ i.e. Aristoteles, Pind.
