Brooks._\r\n\r\nThis picture brings vividly before us an interesting incident of\r\nShakespeare's early days. He has just been caught red-handed in the\r\ncrime of poaching, and is now brought before Sir Thomas Lucy to answer\r\nto the gamekeeper's charge. Though this incident seems well\r\nauthenticated, little is definitely known of this period of the great\r\ndramatist's life. But we do know that that energy, which later achieved\r\nso much, in his youth ran to waste in all kinds of lawless pleasures.\r\nThe artist here depicts Sir Thomas Lucy sitting stern and grave as he\r\nlistens to the constable's charge against Shakespeare. A slaughtered\r\ndeer has been brought in, as testimony against him. Shakespeare himself,\r\nthough seeming fully aware of the gravity of his offence, appears\r\nnevertheless composed and prepared to answer the charge. Though the\r\nmagistrate may not be favorably impressed by the dauntless independence\r\nof Shakespeare's bearing, we may be sure he excites the admiration of\r\nthe feminine members of the household, who are watching him with\r\ninterest. All the accessories of carved woodwork, leaded casements, and\r\ntapestried walls interest us as depicting the interior of a typical\r\nmanor-house of the period.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF\r\nENGLISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY\r\nHENRY VAN LAUN\r\n\r\nWITH A SPECIAL INTRODUCTION BY\r\n\r\nJ. SCOTT CLARK, A. M.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nREVISED EDITION\r\n\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION\r\n\r\nEven at the present day, the historian of Civilization in Europe and in\r\nFrance is amongst us, at the head of those historical studies which he\r\nformerly encouraged so much. I myself have experienced his kindness,\r\nlearned by his conversation, consulted his books, and profited by that\r\nintellectual and impartial breadth, that active and liberal sympathy,\r\nwith which he receives the labors and thoughts of others, even when\r\nthese ideas are not like his own. I consider it a duty and an honor to\r\ninscribe this work to M. Guizot.\r\n\r\nH. A. TAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of M. Taine's \"History of English Literature,\" in 1864,\r\nand its translation into English, in 1872, mark an epoch in educational\r\nhistory, especially in that of America. Prior to the appearance of this\r\nwork, the total knowledge of British writers gained in the school and\r\ncollege life of the ordinary American youth was generally derived in the\r\nform of blind memorization from one text-book. This book was a\r\ncombination of minute biographical detail with the generalities and\r\nabstractions of criticism. The student, and the general reader as well,\r\ndid not really study the great writers at all; he simply memorized what\r\nsomeone had written about them; and he tried, generally in vain, to\r\ncomprehend the real concrete significance of such critical terms as\r\n\"bald, nervous, sonorous,\" etc. But with the distribution of M.\r\nTaine's great work came the beginning of better things. It was the first\r\nstep in an evolution by no means yet completed--a movement paralleled in\r\nthe development of methods of scientific study during the last four\r\ndecades. Forty years ago the pupil did not study oxygen, electricity, or\r\ncellulose; he simply memorized what someone had written _about_ these\r\nelements. He never touched and rarely saw the things themselves, and he\r\ncounted himself fortunate if his instructor had the energy and the\r\nfacilities to perform before the wondering class a few stock\r\nexperiments. But all this has been changed. It is now universally\r\nrecognized that the only sound method of studying any science is the\r\nlaboratory method; that is, the study of the thing itself in all its\r\nmanifestations. In methods of studying literature the progress towards a\r\ntrue scientific, that is, a laboratory method, has been much slower, but\r\nit seems almost equally sure. We are just now in the intermediate stage,\r\nwhere we study \"editions with notes.\" Our educators, as a rule, have yet\r\nto learn that to memorize biographical data and the mere generalities\r\nand negations of criticism, or to trace out obscure allusions and\r\ndoubtful meanings, is not to study a writer in any broad or fruitful\r\nsense. But the movement towards a true scientific method is already well\r\nbegun; and, as we have said, to M. Taine belongs the honor of taking the\r\ninitial step.\r\n\r\nWith Taine's work in hand the thoughtful reader may realize to a large\r\nextent the significance of Leslie Stephen's memorable dictum: \"The whole\r\nart of criticism consists in learning to know the human being who is\r\npartially revealed to us in his written and spoken words.\" M. Taine's\r\npages continually attest his deep conviction that \"the style is the\r\nman,\" in a very comprehensive sense. In his Introduction to his \"History\r\nof English Literature,\" we find such statements as these:--\"You study\r\nthe document only to know the man, just as you study the fossil shell\r\nonly to know the animal behind it; Genuine history is brought into\r\nexistence only when the historian begins to unravel... the living man,\r\ntoiling, impassioned, entrenched in his customs, with his voice and\r\nfeatures, his gestures and dress, distinct and complete as he from whom\r\nwe have just parted in the street; Twenty select phrases from Plato\r\nand Aristophanes will teach you much more than a multitude of\r\ndissertations and commentaries; The true critic is present at the\r\ndrama which was enacted in the soul of the artist or the writer; the\r\nchoice of a word, the brevity or length of a sentence, the nature\r\nof a metaphor, the accent of a verse, the development of an\r\nargument--everything is a symbol to him;... in short he works out its\r\n(the text's) psychology; there is a cause for ambition, for courage, for\r\ntruth, as there is for muscular movement or animal heat.\" To put M.\r\nTaine's great and characteristic merit into a sentence, we may say that\r\nhe was the first writer on English literature to apply to it the\r\nfundamental principle, patent to every person of reflection, that we\r\nnecessarily think in concrete terms, and that, therefore, a treatise\r\nmust be valuable just in proportion to the concreteness of its\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how great was the advance made by M. Taine's work over\r\nits predecessors, let us take a classic English writer at random and\r\ncompare the treatment given him by M. Taine with that given in the\r\ntext-book already mentioned. Suppose we open to the discussion of\r\nAddison. In the latter work we are told that he was born in 1672 and\r\ndied in 1719; that he was a son of Lancelot Addison, a clergyman of some\r\nreputation for learning; that Addison studied at the Charter House,\r\nwhere he formed a friendship with Richard Steele; that he afterwards\r\nentered Oxford; that he wrote various short poems and one long one, of\r\nwhich six whole lines are given as a specimen. We are told, also, that\r\nAddison held, in succession, certain political offices; that he\r\ncontributed one-sixth of the papers found in Steele's \"Tatler,\" more\r\nthan one-half of those in the \"Spectator,\" and one-third of those in the\r\n\"Guardian\"; that he published a drama called \"Cato,\" which, the book\r\ninforms us, is \"cold, solemn, and pompous, written with scrupulous\r\nregard for the classical unities.\" We learn, further, that Addison\r\nmarried a countess, and died at the early age of forty-seven; that he\r\nhad a quarrel with Pope; that his papers published in the \"Tatler,\" the\r\n\"Spectator,\" and the \"Guardian\" are marked by \"fertility of invention\r\nand singular felicity of treatment\"; that their variety is wonderful,\r\nand that everything is treated \"with singular appropriateness and\r\nunforced energy\"; that \"there is a singular harmony between the language\r\nand the thought\" (whatever that may mean); that Addison's delineations\r\nof the characters of men are wonderfully delicate; that he possessed\r\nhumor in its highest and most delicate perfection; that his hymns\r\nbreathe a fervent and tender spirit of piety. Contrary to the usage of\r\nits author, the text-book gives the whole sixteen lines of Addison's\r\nmost famous hymn--the longest illustrative quotation in the whole four\r\nhundred pages--one blessed little oasis in a vast desert of dry\r\nbiographical minutiæ and the abstract generalities of criticism. In the\r\neight pages devoted to Addison there are not more than ten lines of real\r\ncriticism; and these consist, for the most part, of what, to the\r\nordinary reader, are meaningless adjectives or high-sounding epithets.\r\nYet this is one of the very best chapters in the book. It is certainly a\r\nfair specimen of the barren method generally prevalent before the\r\nappearance of M. Taine's work.\r\n\r\nNow let us compare his treatment of Addison. In the first place,\r\nscattered through the eighteen pages devoted to that writer\r\n(single-volume edition) we find no less than twenty-two illustrative\r\npassages, varying in length from six to 176 lines of very fine print. In\r\nhis general treatment M. Taine begins by tracing the physical, social,\r\nand moral environment of Addison, thus leading us up to the\r\nconsideration of the man and the writer by a natural process of\r\nevolution. We are first shown what kind of a man to expect, and then we\r\nare made acquainted with him. And all this is done with the most vivid\r\nand brilliant touches. Mere biographical details are either ignored or\r\ngiven incidental mention. The opening paragraph is a _tableau vivant_,\r\nwhich we see Addison at Oxford, \"studious, peaceful, loving solitary\r\nwalks under the elm avenues.\" We are told how, from boyhood, \"his memory\r\nis stuffed with Latin verses\"; how \"this limited culture, leaving him\r\nweaker, made him more refined\" how \"he acquired a taste for the elegance\r\nand refinement, the triumphs and the artifices, of style\"; how he became\r\n\"an epicure in literature\"; how \"he naturally loved beautiful things\"; how\r\n\"Addison, good and just himself, trusted in God, also a being good and\r\njust\"; how he writes his lay sermons; how \"he cannot suffer languishing\r\nor lazy habits\"; how \"he is full of epigrams against flirtations,\r\nextravagant toilets, useless visits\"; how \"he explains God, reducing him\r\nto a mere magnified man\"; with what literal precision he describes\r\nHeaven; how he \"inserts prayers in his papers and forbids oaths\"; how he\r\nmade morality fashionable.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations of M. Taine's method might be multiplied\r\nindefinitely, but enough have surely been quoted to demonstrate how\r\nvastly more vivid and concrete is the idea of Addison, the man and the\r\nwriter, gained by this method in comparison with that which was in\r\ngeneral vogue before the publication of M. Taine's book. In the one case\r\nthe reader has come into contact with a mere abstraction--a man of\r\nstraw, with not a single feature that impresses itself on the\r\nimagination or the memory. In the other, he has come into communion with\r\na real living soul--a man \"of like passions with ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nBut the very qualities of the great French critic which make his book so\r\nhelpful are the source of his defects as a writer. These qualities are\r\nnational quite as much as individual. It is a truism that the French\r\npeople lead the world in the field of criticism as applied to both\r\nliterature and art. This superiority is strikingly illustrated also in\r\nSt. Beuve, and is due to a certain quickness of perception, a certain\r\npower of concrete illustration, that seems inherent in the race of\r\ncultivated Frenchmen. M. Taine himself well defines this ethnic trait\r\nwhen he speaks of \"France, with her Parisian culture, with her\r\ndrawing-room manners, with her untiring analysis of characters and\r\nactions, her irony so ready to hit upon a weakness, her _finesse_ so\r\npractised in the discrimination of modes of thought.\" This national\r\ntalent is almost invariably associated with a nervous, sanguine\r\ntemperament, which easily tends to extremes of expression. We are\r\ntherefore compelled to read M. Taine with some degree of caution when we\r\nare seeking exact statement and strict limitation.\r\n\r\nAgain, M. Taine is sometimes inaccurate or unjust from a lack of\r\nsympathy. He sometimes finds it impossible to rid himself of his Gallic\r\npredilections and aversions, especially when treating of the Puritan\r\ncharacter or the stolid English morality. He cannot appreciate the\r\nreligious conditions that surround his subject. He is always the\r\nFrenchman discussing the English writer. He cannot forbear to contrast\r\nthe effect or the reception accorded to an author's work in England with\r\nthat which it would have received in France; as when he says, concerning\r\nAddison's lay sermons in the \"Spectator\": \"I know very well what success\r\na newspaper full of sermons would have in France\"; and again: \"If a\r\nFrenchman was forbidden to swear, he would probably laugh at the first\r\nword of the admonition.\" A little farther on he objects to what he\r\ncalls, with certainly picturesque concreteness, \"the sticky plaster of\r\nhis (Addison's) morality\"--an expression that has led to Minto's sharp\r\nretort that Addison's morality was something which it is quite\r\nimpossible for the Gallic conscience to conceive. Another illustration\r\nof that bias which compels us to be somewhat on our guard in reading\r\nTaine is found in his treatment of Milton. Although we may admit that\r\nthe great Puritan poet peopled his paradise with characters having\r\naltogether too strong a British tinge, we are almost shocked to hear\r\nTaine and his disciple, Edmond Scherer, dilate upon Milton's Adam as\r\n\"your true paterfamilias, with a vote; an M. P., an old Oxford man,\"\r\netc., etc., or to hear them exclaim, \"What a great many votes she (Eve)\r\nwill gain among the country squires when Adam stands for Parliament!\"\r\nQuite as striking is M. Taine's inability to understand Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nBut, after making these and all other due admissions concerning Taine's\r\nwork, the fact stands that his \"History of English Literature\" meets\r\nfully Lowell's quaint definition of a classic, when he says, \"After all,\r\nto be delightful is a classic.\" In reading this work we never feel that\r\nwe have in our hands a text-book or even a history. It is rather a\r\nliving, moving panorama. We see again the old miracles and moralities,\r\nwith their queer shifts and their stark incongruities; we see the\r\ndrawing-rooms and hear the conversation of the reign of Queen Anne, and\r\nwalk through Fleet Street with Johnson. In a word, we realize in no\r\nsmall degree the full meaning of Leslie Stephen's dictum, in that we\r\nreally feel that we know, in some degree at least, \"the human being who\r\nis partially revealed to us in his written and spoken words.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, no introduction to this work would be complete without some\r\nreference to the psychological theory on which it is based. We have\r\nreserved this point to the last because, for the general reader, what\r\nTaine says and how he says it, are far more interesting considerations\r\nthan any theories on which the book may be based. In a word, the author\r\nheld that both the character and the style of a writer are the outgrowth\r\nof his social and natural environment. And this environment, in Taine's\r\nopinion, affects not only the individual but the national character as\r\nmanifested in the national literature. In discussing any literary\r\nproduction he would first ask: To what race and nation does the author\r\nbelong? What is the influence of his geographical position and of his\r\nnation's advance in civilization? What about the duration of the\r\nliterary phase represented by the writer in question? In developing this\r\ntheory of the influence of environment M. Taine doubtless sometimes\r\ntreats as permanent scientific factors influences and circumstances that\r\nare in their very nature variable. Yet this application of the theory is\r\nas consistent and plausible as it is everywhere apparent. A few\r\nillustrations of his psychological theory will make more plain than much\r\nabstract discussion the almost fatalistic nature of his method. For\r\nexample, after vividly portraying the political and social conditions\r\nthat had surrounded Milton from his birth, the French critic asks: \"Can\r\nwe expect urbanity here?\" Again, in tracing Dryden's beginnings, he\r\nsays: \"Such circumstances announce and prepare, not an artist, but a man\r\nof letters.\" Much might be written of the detailed application of M.\r\nTaine's psychological theory. But the reader has already been too long\r\ndetained from a perusal of the riches that fill the following pages.\r\nCharles Lamb once wrote: \"I prefer the affections to the sciences.\" The\r\nmajority of the readers of M. Taine will doubtless find so much to enjoy\r\nin his brilliant pages that they will care little for his theories, and\r\nwill not allow certain defects in his sympathies to mar their enjoyment\r\nof this monumental work.\r\n\r\nJ.

Historical documents serve only as a clue to reconstruct the visible\r\nindividual\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory, within a hundred years in Germany, and within sixty years in\r\nFrance, has undergone a transformation, owing to a study of literatures.\r\n\r\nThe discovery has been made that a literary work is not a mere play of\r\nthe imagination, the isolated caprice of an excited brain, but a\r\ntranscript of contemporary manners and customs and the sign of a\r\nparticular state of intellect. The conclusion derived from this is that,\r\nthrough literary monuments, we can retrace the way in which men felt and\r\nthought many centuries ago. This method has been tried and found\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe have meditated over these ways of feeling and thinking and have\r\naccepted them as facts of prime significance. We have found that they\r\nwere dependent on most important events, that they explain these, and\r\nthat these explain them, and that henceforth it was necessary to give\r\nthem their place in history, and one of the highest. This place has been\r\nassigned to them, and hence all is changed in history—the aim, the\r\nmethod, the instrumentalities, and the conceptions of laws and of\r\ncauses. It is this change as now going on, and which must continue to go\r\non, that is here attempted to be set forth.\r\n\r\nOn turning over the large stiff pages of a folio volume, or the yellow\r\nleaves of a manuscript, in short, a poem, a code of laws, a confession\r\nof faith, what is your first comment? You say to yourself that the work\r\nbefore you is not of its own creation. It is simply a mold like a fossil\r\nshell, an imprint similar to one of those forms embedded in a stone by\r\nan animal which once lived and perished. Beneath the shell was an animal\r\nand behind the document there was a man. Why do you study the shell\r\nunless to form some idea of the animal? In the same way do you study the\r\ndocument in order to comprehend the man; both shell and document are\r\ndead fragments and of value only as indications of the complete living\r\nbeing. The aim is to reach this being; this is what you strive to\r\nreconstruct. It is a mistake to study the document as if it existed\r\nalone by itself. That is treating things merely as a pedant, and you\r\nsubject yourself to the illusions of a book-worm. At bottom mythologies\r\nand languages are not existences; the only realities are human beings\r\nwho have employed words and imagery adapted to their organs and to suit\r\nthe original cast of their intellects. A creed is nothing in itself. Who\r\nmade it? Look at this or that portrait of the sixteenth century, the\r\nstern, energetic features of an archbishop or of an English martyr.\r\nNothing exists except through the individual; it is necessary to know\r\nthe individual himself. Let the parentage of creeds be established, or\r\nthe classification of poems, or the growth of constitutions, or the\r\ntransformations of idioms, and we have only cleared the ground. True\r\nhistory begins when the historian has discerned beyond the mists of ages\r\nthe living, active man, endowed with passions, furnished with habits,\r\nspecial in voice, feature, gesture, and costume, distinctive and\r\ncomplete, like anybody that you have just encountered in the street. Let\r\nus strive then, as far as possible, to get rid of this great interval of\r\ntime which prevents us from observing the man with our eyes, the eyes of\r\nour own head. What revelations do we find in the calendered leaves of a\r\nmodern poem? A modern poet, a man like De Musset, Victor Hugo,\r\nLamartine, or Heine, graduated from a college and travelled, wearing a\r\ndress-coat and gloves, favored by ladies, bowing fifty times and\r\nuttering a dozen witticisms in an evening, reading daily newspapers,\r\ngenerally occupying an apartment on the second story, not over-cheerful\r\non account of his nerves, and especially because, in this dense\r\ndemocracy in which we stifle each other, the discredit of official rank\r\nexaggerates his pretensions by raising his importance, and, owing to the\r\ndelicacy of his personal sensations, leading him to regard himself as a\r\nDeity. Such is what we detect behind modern meditations and sonnets.\r\n\r\nAgain, behind a tragedy of the seventeenth century there is a poet, one,\r\nfor example, like Racine, refined, discreet, a courtier, a fine talker,\r\nwith majestic perruque and ribboned shoes, a monarchist and zealous\r\nChristian, \"God having given him the grace not to blush in any society\r\non account of zeal for his king or for the Gospel,\" clever in\r\ninteresting the monarch, translating into proper French \"the _gaulois_\r\nof Amyot,\" deferential to the great, always knowing how to keep his\r\nplace in their company, assiduous and respectful at Marly as at\r\nVersailles, amid the formal creations of a decorative landscape and the\r\nreverential bows, graces, intrigues, and finesses of the braided\r\nseigniors who get up early every morning to obtain the reversion of an\r\noffice, together with the charming ladies who count on their fingers the\r\npedigrees which entitle them to a seat on a footstool. On this point\r\nconsult Saint-Simon and the engravings of Pérelle, the same as you have\r\njust consulted Balzac and the water-color drawings of Eugène Lami.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, on reading a Greek tragedy, our first care is to figure\r\nto ourselves the Greeks, that is to say, men who lived half-naked in the\r\ngymnasiums or on a public square under a brilliant sky, in full view of\r\nthe noblest and most delicate landscape, busy in rendering their bodies\r\nstrong and agile, in conversing together, in arguing, in voting, in\r\ncarrying out patriotic piracies, and yet idle and temperate, the\r\nfurniture of their houses consisting of three earthen jars and their\r\nfood of two pots of anchovies preserved in oil, served by slaves who\r\nafford them the time to cultivate their minds and to exercise their\r\nlimbs, with no other concern than that of having the most beautiful\r\ncity, the most beautiful processions, the most beautiful ideas, and the\r\nmost beautiful men. In this respect, a statue like the \"Meleager\" or the\r\n\"Theseus\" of the Parthenon, or again a sight of the blue and lustrous\r\nMediterranean, resembling a silken tunic out of which islands arise like\r\nmarble bodies, together with a dozen choice phrases selected from the\r\nworks of Plato and Aristophanes, teach us more than any number of\r\ndissertations and commentaries.\r\n\r\nAnd so again, in order to understand an Indian Purana, one must begin by\r\nimagining the father of a family who, \"having seen a son on his son's\r\nknees,\" follows the law and, with axe and pitcher, seeks solitude under\r\na banyan trees, talks no more, multiplies his fastings, lives naked with\r\nfour fires around him under the fifth fire, that terrible sun which\r\nendlessly devours and resuscitates all living things; who fixes his\r\nimagination in turn for weeks at a time on the foot of Brahma, then on\r\nhis knee, on his thigh, on his navel, and so on, until, beneath the\r\nstrain of this intense meditation, hallucinations appear, when all the\r\nforms of being, mingling together and transformed into each other,\r\noscillate to and fro in this vertiginous brain until the motionless man,\r\nwith suspended breath and fixed eyeballs, beholds the universe melting\r\naway like vapor over the vacant immensity of the Being in which he hopes\r\nfor absorption. In this case the best of teachings would be a journey in\r\nIndia; but, for lack of a better one, take the narratives of travellers\r\nalong with works in geography, botany, and ethnology. In any event,\r\nthere must be the same research. A language, a law, a creed, is never\r\nother than an abstraction; the perfect thing is found in the active man,\r\nthe visible corporeal figure which eats, walks, fights, and labors. Set\r\naside the theories of constitutions and their results, of religions and\r\ntheir systems, and try to observe men in their workshops or offices, in\r\ntheir fields along with their own sky and soil, with their own homes,\r\nclothes, occupations and repasts, just as you see them when, on landing\r\nin England or in Italy, you remark their features and gestures, their\r\nroads and their inns, the citizen on his promenades and the workman\r\ntaking a drink. Let us strive as much as possible to supply the place of\r\nthe actual, personal, sensible observation that is no longer\r\npracticable, this being the only way in which we can really know the\r\nman; let us make the past present; to judge of an object it must be\r\npresent; no experience can be had of what is absent. Undoubtedly, this\r\nsort of reconstruction is always imperfect; only an imperfect judgment\r\ncan be based on it; but let us do the best we can; incomplete knowledge\r\nis better than none at all, or than knowledge which is erroneous, and\r\nthere is no other way of obtaining knowledge approximatively of bygone\r\ntimes than by seeing approximatively the men of former times.\r\n\r\nSuch is the first step in history. This, step was taken in Europe at the\r\nend of the last century when the imagination took fresh flight under the\r\nauspices of Lessing and Walter Scott, and a little later in France under\r\nChateaubriand, Augustin Thierry, Michelet, and others. We now come to\r\nthe second step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The outer man is only a clue to study the inner, invisible man\r\n\r\n\r\nOn observing the visible man with your own eyes what do you try to find\r\nin him? The invisible man. These words which your ears catch, those\r\ngestures, those airs of the head, his attire and sensible operations of\r\nall kinds, are, for you, merely so many expressions; these express\r\nsomething, a soul. An inward man is hidden beneath the outward man, and\r\nthe latter simply manifests the former. You have observed the house in\r\nwhich he lives, his furniture, his costume, in order to discover his\r\nhabits and tastes, the degree of his refinement or rusticity, his\r\nextravagance or economy, his follies or his cleverness. You have\r\nlistened to his conversation and noted the inflections of his voice, the\r\nattitudes he has assumed, so as to judge of his spirit, self-abandonment\r\nor gayety, his energy or his rigidity. You consider his writings, works\r\nof art, financial and political schemes, with a view to measure the\r\nreach and limits of his intelligence, his creative power and\r\nself-command, to ascertain the usual order, kind, and force of his\r\nconceptions, in what way he thinks and how he resolves. All these\r\nexternals are so many avenues converging to one centre, and you follow\r\nthese only to reach that centre; here is the real man, namely, that\r\ngroup of faculties and of sentiments which produces the rest. Behold a\r\nnew world, an infinite world; for each visible action involves an\r\ninfinite train of reasonings and emotions, new or old sensations which\r\nhave combined to bring this into light and which, like long ledges of\r\nrock sunk deep in the earth, have cropped out above the surface and\r\nattained their level. It is this subterranean world which forms the\r\nsecond aim, the special object of the historian. If his critical\r\neducation suffices, he is able to discriminate under every ornament in\r\narchitecture, under every stroke of the brush in a picture, under each\r\nphrase of literary composition, the particular sentiment out of which\r\nthe ornament, the stroke, and the phrase have sprung; he is a spectator\r\nof the inward drama which has developed itself in the breast of the\r\nartist or writer; the choice of words, the length or shortness of the\r\nperiod, the species of metaphor, the accent of a verse, the chain of\r\nreasoning--all are to him an indication; while his eyes are reading the\r\ntext his mind and soul are following the steady flow and ever-changing\r\nseries of emotions and conceptions from which this text has issued; he\r\nis working out its psychology. Should you desire to study this\r\noperation, regard the promoter and model of all the high culture of the\r\nepoch, Goethe, who, before composing his \"Iphigenia\" spent days in\r\nmaking drawings of the most perfect statues and who, at last, his eyes\r\nfilled with the noble forms of antique scenery and his mind penetrated\r\nby the harmonious beauty of antique life, succeeded in reproducing\r\ninternally, with such exactness, the habits and yearnings of Greek\r\nimagination as to provide us with an almost twin sister of the\r\n\"Antigone\" of Sophocles and of the goddesses of Phidias. This exact and\r\ndemonstrated divination of bygone sentiments has, in our days, given a\r\nnew life to history. There was almost complete ignorance of this in the\r\nlast century; men of every race and of every epoch were represented as\r\nabout alike, the Greek, the barbarian, the Hindoo, the man of the\r\nRenaissance and the man of the eighteenth century, cast in the same mold\r\nand after the same pattern, and after a certain abstract conception\r\nwhich served for the whole human species. There was a knowledge of man\r\nbut not of men. There was no penetration into the soul itself; nothing\r\nof the infinite diversity and wonderful complexity of souls had been\r\ndetected; it was not known that the moral organization of a people or of\r\nan age is as special and distinct as the physical structure of a family\r\nof plants or of an order of animals. History to-day, like zoölogy, has\r\nfound its anatomy, and whatever branch of it is studied, whether\r\nphilology, languages or mythologies, it is in this way that labor must\r\nbe given to make it produce new fruit. Among so many writers who, since\r\nHerder, Ottfried Müller, and Goethe have steadily followed and\r\nrectified this great effort, let the reader take two historians and two\r\nworks, one \"The Life and Letters of Cromwell\" by Carlyle, and the other\r\nthe \"Port Royal\" of Sainte-Beuve. He will see how precisely, how\r\nclearly, and how profoundly we detect the soul of a man beneath his\r\nactions and works; how, under an old general and in place of an\r\nambitious man vulgarly hypocritical, we find one tormented by the\r\ndisordered reveries of a gloomy imagination, but practical in instinct\r\nand faculties, thoroughly English and strange and incomprehensible to\r\nwhoever has not studied the climate and the race; how, with about a\r\nhundred scattered letters and a dozen or more mutilated speeches, we\r\nfollow him from his farm and his team to his general's tent and to his\r\nProtector's throne, in his transformation and in his development, in his\r\nstruggles of conscience and in his statesman's resolutions, in such a\r\nway that the mechanism of his thought and action becomes visible and the\r\never renewed and fitful tragedy, within which racked this great gloomy\r\nsoul, passes like the tragedies of Shakespeare into the souls of those\r\nwho behold them. We see how, behind convent disputes and the obstinacy\r\nof nuns, we recover one of the great provinces of human psychology; how\r\nfifty or more characters, rendered invisible through the uniformity of a\r\nnarration careful of the properties, come forth in full daylight, each\r\nstanding out clear in its countless diversities; how, underneath\r\ntheological dissertations and monotonous sermons, we discern the\r\nthrobbings of ever-breathing hearts, the excitements and depressions of\r\nthe religious life, the unforeseen reaction and pell-mell stir of\r\nnatural feeling, the infiltrations of surrounding society, the\r\nintermittent triumphs of grace, presenting so many shades of difference\r\nthat the fullest description and most flexible style can scarcely garner\r\nin the vast harvest which the critic has caused to germinate in this\r\nabandoned field. And the same elsewhere. Germany, with its genius, so\r\npliant, so broad, so prompt in transformations, so fitted for the\r\nreproduction of the remotest and strangest states of human thought;\r\nEngland, with its matter-of-fact mind, so suited to the grappling with\r\nmoral problems, to making them clear by figures, weights, and measures,\r\nby geography and statistics, by texts and common sense; France, at\r\nlength, with its Parisian culture and drawing-room habits, with its\r\nunceasing analysis of characters and of works, with its ever ready irony\r\nat detecting weaknesses, with its skilled finesse in discriminating\r\nshades of thought--all have ploughed over the same ground, and we now\r\nbegin to comprehend that no region of history exists in which this deep\r\nsub-soil should not be reached if we would secure adequate crops between\r\nthe furrows.\r\n\r\nSuch is the second step, and we are now in train to follow it out. Such\r\nis the proper aim of contemporary criticism. No one has done this work\r\nso judiciously and on so grand a scale as Sainte-Beuve; in this respect,\r\nwe are all his pupils; literary, philosophic, and religious criticism in\r\nbooks, and even in the newspapers, is to-day entirely changed by his\r\nmethod. Ulterior evolution must start from this point. I have often\r\nattempted to expose what this evolution is; in my opinion, it is a new\r\nroad open to history and which I shall strive to describe more in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The state and the actions of the inner and invisible man have their\r\ncauses in certain general ways of thought and feeling\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having observed in a man and noted down one, two, three, and then\r\na multitude of, sentiments, do these suffice and does your knowledge of\r\nhim seem complete? Does a memorandum book constitute a psychology? It is\r\nnot a psychology, and here, as elsewhere, the search for causes must\r\nfollow the collection of facts. It matters not what the facts may be,\r\nwhether physical or moral, they always spring from causes; there are\r\ncauses for ambition, for courage, for veracity, as well as for\r\ndigestion, for muscular action, and for animal heat. Vice and virtue are\r\nproducts like vitriol and sugar; every complex fact grows out of the\r\nsimple facts with which it is affiliated and on which it depends. We\r\nmust therefore try to ascertain what simple facts underlie moral\r\nqualities the same as we ascertain those that underlie physical\r\nqualities, and, for example, let us take the first fact that comes to\r\nhand, a religious system of music, that of a Protestant church. A\r\ncertain inward cause has inclined the minds of worshippers towards these\r\ngrave, monotonous melodies, a cause much greater than its effect; that\r\nis to say, a general conception of the veritable outward forms of\r\nworship which man owes to God; it is this general conception which has\r\nshaped the architecture of the temple, cast out statues, dispensed with\r\npaintings, effaced ornaments, shortened ceremonies, confined the members\r\nof a congregation to high pews which cut off the view, and governed the\r\nthousand details of decoration, posture, and all other externals. This\r\nconception itself again proceeds from a more general cause, an idea of\r\nhuman conduct in general, inward and outward, prayers, actions,\r\ndispositions of every sort that man is bound to maintain toward the\r\nDeity; it is this which has enthroned the doctrine of grace, lessened\r\nthe importance of the clergy, transformed the sacraments, suppressed\r\nobservances, and changed the religion of discipline into one of\r\nmorality. This conception, in its turn, depends on a third one, still\r\nmore general, that of moral perfection as this is found in a perfect\r\nGod, the impeccable judge, the stern overseer, who regards every soul as\r\nsinful, meriting punishment, incapable of virtue or of salvation, except\r\nthrough a stricken conscience which He provokes and the renewal of the\r\nheart which He brings about. Here is the master conception, consisting\r\nof duty erected into the absolute sovereign of human life, and which\r\nprostrates all other ideals at the feet of the moral ideal. Here we\r\nreach what is deepest in man; for, to explain this conception, we must\r\nconsider the race he belongs to, say the German, the Northman, the\r\nformation and character of his intellect, his ways in general of\r\nthinking and feeling, that tardiness and frigidity of sensation which\r\nkeeps him from rashly and easily falling under the empire of sensual\r\nenjoyments, that bluntness of taste, that irregularity and those\r\noutbursts of conception which arrest in him the birth of refined and\r\nharmonious forms and methods; that disdain of appearances, that yearning\r\nfor truth, that attachment to abstract, bare ideas which develop\r\nconscience in him at the expense of everything else. Here the search\r\ncomes to an end. We have reached a certain primitive disposition, a\r\nparticular trait belonging to sensations of all kinds, to every\r\nconception peculiar to an age or to a race, to characteristics\r\ninseparable from every idea and feeling that stir in the human breast.\r\nSuch are the grand causes, for these are universal and permanent causes,\r\npresent in every case and at every moment, everywhere, and always\r\nactive, indestructible, and inevitably dominant in the end, since,\r\nwhatever accidents cross their path, being limited and partial, end in\r\nyielding to the obscure and incessant repetition of their energy; so\r\nthat the general structure of things and all the main features of events\r\nare their work, all religions and philosophies, all poetic and\r\nindustrial systems, all forms of society and of the family, all, in\r\nfine, being imprints bearing the stamp of their seal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Chief causes of thought and feeling. Their historical effects\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, then, a system in human ideas and sentiments, the prime motor\r\nof which consists in general traits, certain characteristics of thought\r\nand feeling common to men belonging to a particular race, epoch, or\r\ncountry. Just as crystals in mineralogy, whatever their diversity,\r\nproceed from a few simple physical forms, so do civilizations in\r\nhistory, however these may differ, proceed from a few spiritual forms.\r\nOne is explained by a primitive geometrical element as the other is\r\nexplained by a primitive psychological element. In order to comprehend\r\nthe entire group of mineralogical species we must first study a regular\r\nsolid in the general, its facets and angles, and observe in this\r\nabridged form the innumerable transformations of which it is\r\nsusceptible. In like manner, if we would comprehend the entire group of\r\nhistoric varieties we must consider beforehand a human soul in the\r\ngeneral, with its two or three fundamental faculties, and, in this\r\nabridgment, observe the principal forms it may present. This sort of\r\nideal tableau, the geometrical as well as psychological, is not very\r\ncomplex, and we soon detect the limitations of organic conditions to\r\nwhich civilizations, the same as crystals, are forcibly confined. What\r\ndo we find in man at the point of departure? Images or representations\r\nof objects, namely, that which floats before him internally, lasts a\r\ncertain time, is effaced, and then returns after contemplating this or\r\nthat tree or animal, in short, some sensible object. This forms the\r\nmaterial basis of the rest and the development of this material basis is\r\ntwofold, speculative or positive, just as these representations end in a\r\ngeneral conception or in an active resolution. Such is man, summarily\r\nabridged. It is here, within these narrow confines, that human\r\ndiversities are encountered, now in the matter itself and again in the\r\nprimordial twofold development. However insignificant in the elements\r\nthey are of vast significance in the mass, while the slightest change in\r\nthe factors leads to gigantic changes in the results. According as the\r\nrepresentation is distinct, as if stamped by a coining-press, or\r\nconfused and blurred; according as it concentrates in itself a larger or\r\nsmaller number of the characters of an object; according as it is\r\nviolent and accompanied with impulsions or tranquil and surrounded with\r\ncalmness, so are all the operations and the whole running-gear of the\r\nhuman machine entirely transformed. In like manner again, according as\r\nthe ulterior development of the representation varies, so does the whole\r\ndevelopment of the man vary. If the general conception in which this\r\nends is merely a dry notation in Chinese fashion, language becomes a\r\nkind of algebra, religion and poetry are reduced to a minimum,\r\nphilosophy is brought down to a sort of moral and practical common\r\nsense, science to a collection of recipes, classifications, and\r\nutilitarian mnemonics, the mind itself taking a wholly positive turn.\r\nIf, on the contrary, the general conception in which the representation\r\nculminates is a poetic and figurative creation, a living symbol, as with\r\nthe Aryan races, language becomes a sort of shaded and tinted epic in\r\nwhich each word stands as a personage, poesy and religion assume\r\nmagnificent and inexhaustible richness, and metaphysics develops with\r\nbreadth and subtlety without any consideration of positive bearings; the\r\nwhole intellect, notwithstanding the deviation and inevitable weaknesses\r\nof the effort, is captivated by the beautiful and sublime, thus\r\nconceiving an ideal type which, through its nobleness and harmony,\r\ngathers to itself all the affections and enthusiasms of humanity. If, on\r\nthe other hand, the general conception in which the representation\r\nculminates is poetic but abrupt, is reached not gradually but by sudden\r\nintuition, if the original operation is not a regular development but a\r\nviolent explosion--then, as with the Semitic races, metaphysical power\r\nis wanting; the religious conception becomes that of a royal God,\r\nconsuming and solitary; science cannot take shape, the intellect grows\r\nrigid and too headstrong to reproduce the delicate ordering of nature;\r\npoetry cannot give birth to aught but a series of vehement, grandiose\r\nexclamations, while language no longer renders the concatenation of\r\nreasoning and eloquence, man being reduced to lyric enthusiasm, to\r\nungovernable passion, and to narrow and fanatical action. It is in this\r\ninterval between the particular representation and the universal\r\nconception that the germs of the greatest human differences are found.\r\nSome races, like the classic, for example, pass from the former to the\r\nlatter by a graduated scale of ideas regularly classified and more and\r\nmore general; others, like the Germanic, traverse the interval in leaps,\r\nwith uniformity and after prolonged and uncertain groping. Others, like\r\nthe Romans and the English, stop at the lowest stages; others, like the\r\nHindoos and Germans, mount to the uppermost. If, now, after considering\r\nthe passage from the representation to the idea, we regard the passage\r\nfrom the representation to the resolution, we find here elementary\r\ndifferences of like importance and of the same order, according as the\r\nimpression is vivid, as in Southern climes, or faint, as in Northern\r\nclimes, as it ends in instantaneous action as with barbarians, or\r\ntardily as with civilized nations, as it is capable or not of growth, of\r\ninequality, of persistence and of association. The entire system of\r\nhuman passion, all the risks of public peace and security, all labor and\r\naction, spring from these sources. It is the same with the other\r\nprimordial differences; their effects embrace an entire civilization,\r\nand may be likened to those algebraic formulæ which, within narrow\r\nbounds, describe beforehand the curve of which these form the law. Not\r\nthat this law always prevails to the end; sometimes, perturbations\r\narise, but, even when this happens, it is not because the law is\r\ndefective, but because it has not operated alone. New elements have\r\nentered into combination with old ones; powerful foreign forces have\r\ninterfered to oppose primitive forces. The race has emigrated, as with\r\nthe ancient Aryans, and the change of climate has led to a change in the\r\nwhole intellectual economy and structure of society. A people has been\r\nconquered like the Saxon nation, and the new political structure has\r\nimposed on it customs, capacities, and desires which it did not possess.\r\nThe nation has established itself permanently in the midst of\r\ndowntrodden and threatening subjects, as with the ancient Spartans,\r\nwhile the necessity of living, as in an armed encampment, has violently\r\nturned the whole moral and social organization in one unique direction.\r\nAt all events, the mechanism of human history is like this. We always\r\nfind the primitive mainspring consisting of some widespread tendency of\r\nsoul and intellect, either innate and natural to the race or acquired by\r\nit and due to some circumstance forced upon it. These great given\r\nmainsprings gradually produce their effects, that is to say, at the end\r\nof a few centuries they place the nation in a new religious, literary,\r\nsocial, and economic state; a new condition which, combined with their\r\nrenewed effort, produces another condition, sometimes a good one,\r\nsometimes a bad one, now slowly, now rapidly, and so on; so that the\r\nentire development of each distinct civilization may be considered as\r\nthe effect of one permanent force which, at every moment, varies its\r\nwork by modifying the circumstances where it acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The three primordial forces.--Race\r\n\r\n\r\nThree different sources contribute to the production of this elementary\r\nmoral state, race, environment, and epoch. What we call race consists of\r\nthose innate and hereditary dispositions which man brings with him into\r\nthe world and which are generally accompanied with marked differences of\r\ntemperament and of bodily structure. They vary in different nations.\r\nNaturally, there are varieties of men as there are varieties of cattle\r\nand horses, some brave and intelligent, and others timid and of limited\r\ncapacity; some capable of superior conceptions and creations, and others\r\nreduced to rudimentary ideas and contrivances; some specially fitted for\r\ncertain works, and more richly furnished with certain instincts, as we\r\nsee in the better endowed species of dogs, some for running and others\r\nfor fighting, some for hunting and others for guarding houses and\r\nflocks. We have here a distinct force; so distinct that, in spite of the\r\nenormous deviations which both the other motors impress upon it, we\r\nstill recognize, and which a race like the Aryan people, scattered from\r\nthe Ganges to the Hebrides, established under all climates, ranged along\r\nevery degree of civilization, transformed by thirty centuries of\r\nrevolutions, shows nevertheless in its languages, in its religions, in\r\nits literatures, and in its philosophies, the community of blood and of\r\nintellect which still to-day binds together all its offshoots. However\r\nthey may differ, their parentage is not lost; barbarism, culture and\r\ngrafting, differences of atmosphere and of soil, fortunate or\r\nunfortunate occurrences, have operated in vain; the grand\r\ncharacteristics of the original form have lasted, and we find that the\r\ntwo or three leading features of the primitive imprint are again\r\napparent under the subsequent imprints with which time has overlaid\r\nthem. There is nothing surprising in this extraordinary tenacity.\r\nAlthough the immensity of the distance allows us to catch only a glimpse\r\nin a dubious light of the origin of species,[1] the events of history\r\nthrow sufficient light on events anterior to history to explain the\r\nalmost unshaken solidity of primordial traits. At the moment of\r\nencountering them, fifteen, twenty, and thirty centuries before our era,\r\nin an Aryan, Egyptian, or Chinese, they represent the work of a much\r\ngreater number of centuries, perhaps the work of many myriads of\r\ncenturies. For, as soon as an animal is born it must adapt itself to its\r\n[surroundings]; it breathes in another way, it renews itself differently,\r\nit is otherwise stimulated according as the atmosphere, the food, and\r\nthe temperature are different. A different climate and situation create\r\ndifferent necessities and hence activities of a different kind; and\r\nhence, again, a system of different habits, and, finally a system of\r\ndifferent aptitudes and instincts. Man, thus compelled to put himself in\r\nequilibrium with circumstances, contracts a corresponding temperament\r\nand character, and his character, like his temperament, are acquisitions\r\nall the more stable because of the outward impression being more deeply\r\nimprinted in him by more frequent repetitions and transmitted to his\r\noffspring by more ancient heredity. So that at each moment of time, the\r\ncharacter of a people may be considered as a summary of all antecedent\r\nactions and sensations; that is to say, as a quantity and as a weighty\r\nmass, not infinite,[2] since all things in nature are limited, but\r\ndisproportionate to the rest and almost impossible to raise, since each\r\nminute of an almost infinite past has contributed to render it heavier,\r\nand, in order to turn the scale, it would require, on the other side, a\r\nstill greater accumulation of actions and sensations. Such is the first\r\nand most abundant source of these master faculties from which historic\r\nevents are derived; and we see at once that if it is powerful it is\r\nowing to its not being a mere source, but a sort of lake, and like a\r\ndeep reservoir wherein other sources have poured their waters for a\r\nmultitude of centuries.\r\n\r\nWhen we have thus verified the internal structure of a race we must\r\nconsider the environment in which it lives. For man is not alone in the\r\nworld; nature envelops him and other men surround him; accidental and\r\nsecondary folds come and overspread the primitive and permanent fold,\r\nwhile physical or social circumstances derange or complete the natural\r\ngroundwork surrendered to them. At one time climate has had its effect.\r\nAlthough the history of Aryan nations can be only obscurely traced from\r\ntheir common country to their final abodes, we can nevertheless affirm\r\nthat the profound difference which is apparent between the Germanic\r\nraces on the one hand, and the Hellenic and Latin races on the other,\r\nproceeds in great part from the differences between the countries in\r\nwhich they have established themselves--the former in cold and moist\r\ncountries, in the depths of gloomy forests and swamps, or on the borders\r\nof a wild ocean, confined to melancholic or rude sensations, inclined to\r\ndrunkenness and gross feeding, leading a militant and carnivorous life;\r\nthe latter, on the contrary, living amidst the finest scenery, alongside\r\nof a brilliant, sparkling sea inviting navigation and commerce, exempt\r\nfrom the grosser cravings of the stomach, disposed at the start to\r\nsocial habits and customs, to political organization, to the sentiments\r\nand faculties which develop the art of speaking, the capacity for\r\nenjoyment and invention in the sciences, in art, and in literature. At\r\nanother time, political events have operated, as in the two Italian\r\ncivilizations: the first one tending wholly to action, to conquest, to\r\ngovernment, and to legislation, through the primitive situation of a\r\ncity of refuge, a frontier emporium, and of an armed aristocracy which,\r\nimporting and enrolling foreigners and the vanquished under it, sets two\r\nhostile bodies facing each other, with no outlet for its internal\r\ntroubles and rapacious instincts but systematic warfare; the second one,\r\nexcluded from unity and political ambition on a grand scale by the\r\npermanency of its municipal system, by the cosmopolite situation of its\r\npope and by the military intervention of neighboring states, and\r\nfollowing the bent of its magnificent and harmonious genius, is wholly\r\ncarried over to the worship of voluptuousness and beauty. Finally, at\r\nanother time, social conditions have imposed their stamp as, eighteen\r\ncenturies ago, by Christianity, and twenty-five centuries ago by\r\nBuddhism, when, around the Mediterranean as in Hindostan, the extreme\r\neffects of Aryan conquest and organization led to intolerable\r\noppression, the crushing of the individual, utter despair, the whole\r\nworld under the ban of a curse, with the development of metaphysics and\r\nvisions, until man, in this dungeon of despondency, feeling his heart\r\nmelt, conceived of abnegation, charity, tender love, gentleness,\r\nhumility, human brotherhood, here in the idea of universal nothingness,\r\nand there under that of the fatherhood of God. Look around at the\r\nregulative instincts and faculties implanted in a race; in brief, the\r\nturn of mind according to which it thinks and acts at the present day;\r\nwe shall find most frequently that its work is due to one of these\r\nprolonged situations, to these enveloping circumstances, to these\r\npersistent gigantic pressures brought to bear on a mass of men who, one\r\nby one, and all collectively, from one generation to another, have been\r\nunceasingly bent and fashioned by them, in Spain a crusade of eight\r\ncenturies against the Mohammedans, prolonged yet longer even to the\r\nexhaustion of the nation through the expulsion of the Moors, through the\r\nspoliation of the Jews, through the establishment of the Inquisition,\r\nthrough the Catholic wars; in England, a political establishment of\r\neight centuries which maintains man erect and respectful, independent\r\nand obedient, all accustomed to struggling together in a body under the\r\nsanction of law; in France, a Latin organization which, at first imposed\r\non docile barbarians, then levelled to the ground under the universal\r\ndemolition, forms itself anew under the latent workings of national\r\ninstinct, developing under hereditary monarchs and ending in a sort of\r\nequalized, centralized, administrative republic under dynasties exposed\r\nto revolutions. Such are the most efficacious among the observable\r\ncauses which mold the primitive man; they are to nations what education,\r\npursuit, condition, and abode are to individuals, and seem to comprise\r\nall, since the external forces which fashion human matter, and by which\r\nthe outward acts on the inward, are comprehended in them.\r\n\r\nThere is, nevertheless, a third order of causes, for, with the forces\r\nwithin and without, there is the work these have already produced\r\ntogether, which work itself contributes towards producing the ensuing\r\nwork; beside the permanent impulsion and the given environment there is\r\nthe acquired momentum. When national character and surrounding\r\ncircumstances operate it is not on a _tabula rasa_, but on one already\r\nbearing imprints. According as this _tabula_ is taken at one or at\r\nanother moment so is the imprint different, and this suffices to render\r\nthe total effect different. Consider, for example, two moments of a\r\nliterature or of an art, French tragedy under Corneille and under\r\nVoltaire, and Greek drama under Æschylus and under Euripides, Latin\r\npoetry under Lucretius and under Claudian, and Italian painting under Da\r\nVinci and under Guido. Assuredly, there is no change of general\r\nconception at either of these two extreme points; ever the same human\r\ntype must be portrayed or represented in action; the cast of the verse,\r\nthe dramatic structure, the physical form have all persisted. But there\r\nis this among these differences, that one of the artists is a precursor\r\nand the other a successor, that the first one has no model and the\r\nsecond one has a model; that the former sees things face to face, and\r\nthat the latter sees them through the intermediation of the former, that\r\nmany departments of art have become more perfect, that the simplicity\r\nand grandeur of the impression have diminished, that what is pleasing\r\nand refined in form has augmented--in short, that the first work has\r\ndetermined the second. In this respect, it is with a people as with a\r\nplant; the same sap at the same temperature and in the same soil\r\nproduces, at different stages of its successive elaborations, different\r\ndevelopments, buds, flowers, fruits, and seeds, in such a way that the\r\ncondition of the following is always that of the preceding and is born\r\nof its death. Now, if you no longer regard a brief moment, as above, but\r\none of those grand periods of development which embraces one or many\r\ncenturies like the Middle Ages, or our last classic period, the\r\nconclusion is the same. A certain dominating conception has prevailed\r\nthroughout; mankind, during two hundred years, during five hundred\r\nyears, have represented to themselves a certain ideal figure of man, in\r\nmediæval times the knight and the monk, in our classic period the\r\ncourtier and refined talker; this creative and universal conception has\r\nmonopolized the entire field of action and thought, and, after spreading\r\nits involuntarily systematic works over the world, it languished and\r\nthen died out, and now a new idea has arisen, destined to a like\r\ndomination and to equally multiplied creations. Note here that the\r\nlatter depends in part on the former, and that it is the former, which,\r\ncombining its effect with those of national genius and surrounding\r\ncircumstances, will impose their bent and their direction on new-born\r\nthings. It is according to this law that great historic currents are\r\nformed, meaning by this, the long rule of a form of intellect or of a\r\nmaster idea, like that period of spontaneous creations called the\r\nRenaissance, or that period of oratorical classifications called the\r\nClassic Age, or that series of mystic systems called the Alexandrine and\r\nChristian [epoch], or that series of mythological efflorescences found at\r\nthe origins of Germany, India, and Greece. Here as elsewhere, we are\r\ndealing merely with a mechanical problem: the total effect is a compound\r\nwholly determined by the grandeur and direction of the forces which\r\nproduce it. The sole difference which separates these moral problems\r\nfrom physical problems lies in this, that in the former the directions\r\nand grandeur cannot be estimated by or stated in figures with the same\r\nprecision as in the latter. If a want, a faculty, is a quantity capable\r\nof degrees, the same as pressure or weight, this quantity is not\r\nmeasurable like that of the pressure or weight. We cannot fix it in an\r\nexact or approximative formula; we can obtain or give of it only a\r\nliterary impression; we are reduced to noting and citing the prominent\r\nfacts which make it manifest and which nearly, or roughly, indicate\r\nabout what grade on the scale it must be ranged at. And yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the methods of notation are not the same in the moral\r\nsciences as in the physical sciences, nevertheless, as matter is the\r\nsame in both, and is equally composed of forces, directions and\r\nmagnitudes, we can still show that in one as in the other, the final\r\neffect takes place according to the same law. This is great or small,\r\naccording as the fundamental forces are great or small and act more or\r\nless precisely in the same sense, according as the distinct effects of\r\nrace, environment and epoch combine to enforce each other or combine to\r\nneutralize each other. Thus are explained the long impotences and the\r\nbrilliant successes which appear irregularly and with no apparent reason\r\nin the life of a people; the causes of these consist in internal\r\nconcordances and contrarieties. There was one of these concordances\r\nwhen, in the seventeenth century, the social disposition and\r\nconversational spirit innate in France encountered drawing-room\r\nformalities and the moment of oratorical analysis; when, in the\r\nnineteenth century, the flexible, profound genius of Germany encountered\r\nthe age of philosophic synthesis and of cosmopolite criticism. One of\r\nthese contrarieties happened when, in the seventeenth century, the\r\nblunt, isolated genius of England awkwardly tried to don the new polish\r\nof urbanity, and when, in the sixteenth century, the lucid, prosaic\r\nFrench intellect tried to gestate a living poesy. It is this secret\r\nconcordance of creative forces which produced the exquisite courtesy and\r\nnoble cast of literature under Louis XIV and Bossuet, and the grandiose\r\nmetaphysics and broad critical sympathy under Hegel and Goethe. It is\r\nthis secret contrariety of creative forces which produced the literary\r\nincompleteness, the licentious plays, the abortive drama of Dryden and\r\nWycherly, the poor Greek importations, the gropings, the minute beauties\r\nand fragments of Ronsard and the Pleiad. We may confidently affirm that\r\nthe unknown creations toward which the current of coming ages is bearing\r\nus will spring from and be governed by these primordial forces; that, if\r\nthese forces could be measured and computed we might deduce from them,\r\nas from a formula, the characters of future civilization; and that if,\r\nnotwithstanding the evident rudeness of our notations, and the\r\nfundamental inexactitude of our measures, we would nowadays form some\r\nidea of our general destinies, we must base our conjectures on an\r\nexamination of these forces. For, in enumerating them, we run through\r\nthe full circle of active forces; and when the race, the environment,\r\nand the moment have been considered--that is to say the inner\r\nmainspring, the pressure from without, and the impulsion already\r\nacquired--we have exhausted not only all real causes but again all\r\npossible causes of movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. History is a mechanical and psychological problem. Within certain\r\nlimits man can foretell\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remains to be ascertained in what way these causes, applied to a\r\nnation or to a century, distribute their effects. Like a spring issuing\r\nfrom an elevated spot and diffusing its waters, according to the height,\r\nfrom ledge to ledge, until it finally reaches the low ground, so does\r\nthe tendency of mind or of soul in a people, due to race, epoch, or\r\nenvironment, diffuse itself in different proportions, and by regular\r\ndescent, over the different series of facts which compose its\r\ncivilization.[3] In preparing the geographical map of a country,\r\nstarting at its watershed, we see the slopes, just below this common\r\npoint, dividing themselves into five or six principal basins, and then\r\neach of the latter into several others, and so on until the whole\r\ncountry, with its thousands of inequalities of surface, is included in\r\nthe ramifications of this network. In like manner, in preparing the\r\npsychological map of the events and sentiments belonging to a certain\r\nhuman civilization, we find at the start five or six well determined\r\nprovinces--religion, art, philosophy, the state, the family, and\r\nindustries; next, in each of these provinces, natural departments, and\r\nthen finally, in each of these departments, still smaller territories\r\nuntil we arrive at those countless details of life which we observe\r\ndaily in ourselves and around us. If, again, we examine and compare\r\ntogether these various groups of facts we at once find that they are\r\ncomposed of parts and that all have parts in common. Let us take first\r\nthe three principal products of human intelligence--religion, art, and\r\nphilosophy. What is a philosophy but a conception of nature and of its\r\n[primordial causes] under the form of abstractions and formulas? What\r\nunderlies a religion and an art if not a conception of this same nature,\r\nand of these same primordial causes, under the form of more or less\r\ndeterminate symbols, and of more or less distinct personages, with this\r\ndifference, that in the first case we believe that they exist, and in\r\nthe second case that they do not exist. Let the reader consider some of\r\nthe great creations of the intellect in India, in Scandinavia, in\r\nPersia, in Rome, in Greece, and he will find that art everywhere is a\r\nsort of philosophy become sensible, religion a sort of poem regarded as\r\ntrue, and philosophy a sort of art and religion, desiccated and reduced\r\nto pure abstractions. There is, then, in the centre of each of these\r\ngroups a common element, the conception of the world and its origin, and\r\nif they differ amongst each other it is because each combines with the\r\ncommon element a distinct element; here the power of abstraction, there\r\nthe faculty of personifying with belief, and, finally, the talent for\r\npersonifying without belief. Let us now take the two leading products of\r\nhuman association, the Family and the State. What constitutes the State\r\nother than the sentiment of obedience by which a multitude of men\r\ncollect together under the authority of a chief? And what constitutes\r\nthe Family other than the sentiment of obedience by which a wife and\r\nchildren act together under the direction of a father and husband? The\r\nFamily is a natural, primitive, limited state, as the State is an\r\nartificial, ulterior, and expanded Family, while beneath the differences\r\nwhich arise from the number, origin, and condition of its members, we\r\ndistinguish, in the small as in the large community, a like fundamental\r\ndisposition of mind which brings them together and unites them. Suppose,\r\nnow, that this common element receives from the environment, the epoch,\r\nand the race peculiar characteristics, and it is clear that all the\r\ngroups into which it enters will be proportionately modified. If the\r\nsentiment of obedience is merely one of fear,[4] you encounter, as in\r\nmost of the Oriental states, the brutality of despotism, a prodigality\r\nof vigorous punishments, the exploitation of the subject, servile\r\nhabits, insecurity of property, impoverished production, female slavery,\r\nand the customs of the harem. If the sentiment of obedience is rooted in\r\nthe instinct of discipline, sociability, and honor, you find, as in\r\nFrance, a complete military organization, a superb administrative\r\nhierarchy, a weak public spirit with outbursts of patriotism, the\r\nunhesitating docility of the subject along with the hotheadedness of the\r\nrevolutionist, the obsequiousness of the courtier along with the reverse\r\nof the gentleman, the charm of refined conversation along with home and\r\nfamily bickerings, conjugal equality together with matrimonial\r\nincompatibilities under the necessary constraints of the law. If,\r\nfinally, the sentiment of obedience is rooted in the instinct of\r\nsubordination and in the idea of duty, you perceive, as in Germanic\r\nnations, the security and contentment of the household, the firm\r\nfoundations of domestic life, the slow and imperfect development of\r\nworldly matters, innate respect for established rank, superstitious\r\nreverence for the past, maintenance of social inequalities, natural and\r\nhabitual deference to the law. Similarly in a race, just as there is a\r\ndifference of aptitude for general ideas, so will its religion, art, and\r\nphilosophy be different. If man is naturally fitted for broader\r\nuniversal conceptions and inclined at the same time to their\r\nderangement, through the nervous irritability of an overexcited\r\norganization, we find, as in India, a surprising richness of gigantic\r\nreligious creations, a splendid bloom of extravagant transparent epics,\r\na strange concatenation of subtle, imaginative philosophic systems, all\r\nso intimately associated and so interpenetrated with a common sap, that\r\nwe at once recognize them, by their amplitude, by their color, and by\r\ntheir disorder, as productions of the same climate and of the same\r\nspirit. If, on the contrary, the naturally sound and well-balanced man\r\nis content to restrict his conceptions to narrow bounds in order to cast\r\nthem in more precise forms, we see, as in Greece, a theology of artists\r\nand narrators, special gods that are soon separated from objects and\r\nalmost transformed at once into substantial personages, the sentiment of\r\nuniversal unity nearly effaced and scarcely maintained in the vague\r\nnotion of destiny, a philosophy, rather than subtle and compact,\r\ngrandiose and systematic, narrow metaphysically[5] but incomparable in\r\nits logic, sophistry, and morality, si poesy and arts superior to\r\nanything we have seen in lucidity, naturalness, proportion, truth, and\r\nbeauty. If, finally, man is reduced to narrow conceptions deprived of\r\nany speculative subtlety, and at the same time finds that he is absorbed\r\nand completely hardened by practical interests, we see, as in Rome,\r\nrudimentary deities, mere empty names, good for denoting the petty\r\ndetails of agriculture, generation, and the household, veritable\r\nmarriage and farming labels, and, therefore, a null or borrowed\r\nmythology, philosophy, and poesy. Here, as elsewhere, comes in the law\r\nof mutual dependencies.[6] A civilization is a living unit, the parts of\r\nwhich hold together the same as the parts of an organic body. Just as in\r\nan animal, the instincts, teeth, limbs, bones, and muscular apparatus\r\nare bound together in such a way that a variation of one determines a\r\ncorresponding variation in the others, and out of which a skilful\r\nnaturalist, with a few bits, imagines and reconstructs an almost\r\ncomplete body, so, in a civilization, do religion, philosophy, the\r\nfamily scheme, literature and the arts form a system in which each local\r\nchange involves a general change, so that an experienced historian, who\r\nstudies one portion apart from the others, sees beforehand and partially\r\npredicts the characteristics of the rest. There is nothing vague in this\r\ndependence. The regulation of all this in the living body consists,\r\nfirst, of the tendency to manifest a certain primordial type, and, next,\r\nthe necessity of its possessing organs which can supply its wants and\r\nput itself in harmony with itself in order to live. The regulation in a\r\ncivilization consists in the presence in each great human creation of an\r\nelementary producer equally present in other surrounding creations, that\r\nis, some faculty and aptitude, some efficient and marked disposition,\r\nwhich, with its own peculiar character, introduces this with that into\r\nall operations in which it takes part, and which, according to its\r\nvariations, causes variation in all the works in which it cooperates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Law of formation of a group. Examples and indications\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving reached this point, we can obtain a glimpse of the principal\r\nfeatures of human transformation, and can now search for the general\r\nlaws which regulate not only events, but classes of events; not only\r\nthis religion or that literature, but the whole group of religions or of\r\nliteratures. If, for example, it is admitted that a religion is a\r\nmetaphysical poem associated with belief; if it is recognized, besides,\r\nthat there are certain races and certain environments in which belief,\r\npoetic faculty, and metaphysical faculty display themselves in common\r\nwith unwonted vigor; if we consider that Christianity and Buddhism were\r\ndeveloped at periods of grand systematizations and in the midst of\r\nsufferings like the oppression which stirred up the fanatics of\r\nCevennes; if, on the other hand, it is recognized that primitive\r\nreligions are born at the dawn of human reason, during the richest\r\nexpansion of human imagination, at times of the greatest _naïveté_ and\r\nof the greatest credulity; if we consider, again, that Mohammedanism\r\nappeared along with the advent of poetic prose and of the conception of\r\nmaterial unity, amongst a people destitute of science and at the moment\r\nof a sudden development of the intellect--we might conclude that\r\nreligion is born and declines, is reformed and transformed, according as\r\ncircumstances fortify and bring together, with more or less precision\r\nand energy, its three generative instincts; and we would then comprehend\r\nwhy religion is endemic in India among specially exalted imaginative and\r\nphilosophic intellects; why it blooms out so wonderfully and so grandly\r\nin the Middle Ages, in an oppressive society, amongst new languages and\r\nliteratures; why it develops again in the sixteenth century with a new\r\ncharacter and an heroic enthusiasm, at the time of an universal\r\nrenaissance and at the awakening of the Germanic races; why it swarms\r\nout in so many bizarre sects in the rude democracy of America and under\r\nthe bureaucratic despotism of Russia; why, in fine, it is seen spreading\r\nout in the Europe of to-day in such different proportions and with such\r\nspecial traits, according to such differences of race and of\r\ncivilizations. And so for every kind of human production, for letters,\r\nmusic, the arts of design, philosophy, the sciences, state industries,\r\nand the rest. Each has some moral tendency for its direct cause, or a\r\nconcurrence of moral tendencies; given the cause, it appears; the cause\r\nwithdrawn, it disappears; the weakness or intensity of the cause is the\r\nmeasure of its own weakness or intensity. It is bound to that like any\r\nphysical phenomenon to its condition, like dew to the chilliness of a\r\nsurrounding atmosphere, like dilatation to heat. Couples exist in the\r\nmoral world as they exist in the physical world, as rigorously linked\r\ntogether and as universally diffused. Whatever in one case produces,\r\nalters, or suppresses the first term, produces, alters, and suppresses\r\nthe second term as a necessary consequence. Whatever cools the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere causes the fall of dew. Whatever develops\r\ncredulity, along with poetic conceptions of the universe, engenders\r\nreligion. Thus have things come about, and thus will they continue to\r\ncome about. As soon as the adequate and necessary condition of one of\r\nthese vast apparitions becomes known to us our mind has a hold on the\r\nfuture as well as on the past. We can confidently state under what\r\ncircumstances it will reappear, foretell without rashness many portions\r\nof its future history, and sketch with precaution some of the traits of\r\nits ulterior development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. General problem and future of history. Psychological method.\r\nValue of literature. Purpose in writing this book\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory has reached this point at the present day, or rather it is\r\nnearly there, on the threshold of this inquest. The question as now\r\nstated is this: Given a literature, a philosophy, a society, an art, a\r\ncertain group of arts, what is the moral state of things which produces\r\nit? And what are the conditions of race, epoch, and environment the best\r\nadapted to produce this moral state? There is a distinct moral state for\r\neach of these formations and for each of their branches; there is one\r\nfor art in general as well as for each particular art; for architecture,\r\npainting, sculpture, music, and poetry, each with a germ of its own in\r\nthe large field of human psychology; each has its own law, and it is by\r\nvirtue of this law that we see each shoot up, apparently haphazard,\r\nsingly and alone, amidst the miscarriages of their neighbors, like\r\npainting in Flanders and Holland in the seventeenth century, like poetry\r\nin England in the sixteenth century, like music in Germany in the\r\neighteenth century. At this moment, and in these countries, the\r\nconditions for one art and not for the others are fulfilled, and one\r\nbranch only has bloomed out amidst the general sterility. It is these\r\nlaws of human vegetation which history must now search for; it is this\r\nspecial psychology of each special formation which must be got at; it is\r\nthe composition of a complete table of these peculiar conditions that\r\nmust now be worked out. There is nothing more delicate and nothing more\r\ndifficult. Montesquieu undertook it, but in his day the interest in\r\nhistory was too recent for him to be successful; nobody, indeed, had any\r\nidea of the road that was to be followed, and even at the present day we\r\nscarcely begin to obtain a glimpse of it. Just as astronomy, at bottom,\r\nis a mechanical problem, and physiology, likewise, a chemical problem,\r\nso is history, at bottom, a problem of psychology. There is a particular\r\nsystem of inner impressions and operations which fashions the artist,\r\nthe believer, the musician, the painter, the nomad, the social man; for\r\neach of these, the filiation, intensity, and interdependence of ideas\r\nand of emotions are different; each has his own moral history, and his\r\nown special organization, along with some master tendency and with some\r\ndominant trait. To explain each of these would require a chapter devoted\r\nto a profound internal analysis, and that is a work that can scarcely be\r\ncalled sketched out at the present day. But one man, Stendhal, through a\r\ncertain turn of mind and a peculiar education, has attempted it, and\r\neven yet most of his readers find his works paradoxical and obscure. His\r\ntalent and ideas were too premature. His admirable insight, his profound\r\nsayings carelessly thrown out, the astonishing precision of his notes\r\nand logic, were not understood; people were not aware that, under the\r\nappearances and talk of a man of the world, he explained the most\r\ncomplex of internal mechanisms; that his finger touched the great\r\nmainspring, that he brought scientific processes to bear in the history\r\nof the heart, the art of employing figures, of decomposing, of deducing;\r\nthat he was the first to point out fundamental causes such as\r\nnationalities, climates, and temperaments; in short, that he treated\r\nsentiments as they should be treated, that is to say, as a naturalist\r\nand physicist, by making classifications and estimating forces. On\r\naccount of all this he was pronounced dry and eccentric and allowed to\r\nlive in isolation, composing novels, books of travel and taking notes,\r\nfor which he counted upon, and has obtained, about a dozen or so of\r\nreaders. And yet his works are those in which we of the present day may\r\nfind the most satisfactory efforts that have been made to clear the road\r\nI have just striven to describe. Nobody has taught one better how to\r\nobserve with one's own eyes, first, to regard humanity around us and\r\nlife as it is, and next, old and authentic documents; how to read more\r\nthan merely the black and white of the page; how to detect under old\r\nprint and the scrawl of the text the veritable sentiment and the train\r\nof thought, the mental state in which the words were penned. In his\r\nwritings, as in those of Sainte-Beuve and in those of the German\r\ncritics, the reader will find how much is to be derived from a literary\r\ndocument; if this document is rich and we know how to interpret it, we\r\nwill find in it the psychology of a particular soul, often that of an\r\nage, and sometimes that of a race. In this respect, a great poem, a good\r\nnovel, the confessions of a superior man, are more instructive than a\r\nmass of historians and histories; I would give fifty volumes of charters\r\nand a hundred diplomatic files for the memoirs of Cellini, the epistles\r\nof Saint Paul, the table-talk of Luther, or the comedies of\r\nAristophanes. Herein lies the value of literary productions. They are\r\ninstructive because they are beautiful; their usefulness increases with\r\ntheir perfection; and if they provide us with documents, it is because\r\nthey are monuments. The more visible a book renders sentiments the more\r\nliterary it is, for it is the special office of literature to take note\r\nof sentiments. The more important the sentiments noted in a book the\r\nhigher its rank in literature, for it is by representing what sort of a\r\nlife a nation or an epoch leads, that a writer rallies to himself the\r\nsympathies of a nation or of an epoch. Hence, among the documents which\r\nbring before our eyes the sentiments of preceding generations, a\r\nliterature, and especially a great literature, is incomparably the best.\r\nIt resembles those admirable instruments of remarkable sensitiveness\r\nwhich physicists make use of to detect and measure the most profound and\r\ndelicate changes that occur in a human body. There is nothing\r\napproaching this in constitutions or religions; the articles of a code\r\nor of a catechism do no more than depict mind in gross and without\r\nfinesse; if there are documents which show life and spirit in politics\r\nand in creeds, they are the eloquent discourses of the pulpit and the\r\ntribune, memoirs and personal confessions, all belonging to literature,\r\nso that, outside of itself, literature embodies whatever is good\r\nelsewhere. It is mainly in studying literatures that we are able to\r\nproduce moral history, and arrive at some knowledge of the psychological\r\nlaws on which events depend.\r\n\r\nI have undertaken to write a history of a literature and to ascertain\r\nthe psychology of a people; in selecting this one, it is not without a\r\nmotive. A people had to be taken possessing a vast and complete\r\nliterature, which is rarely found. There are few nations which,\r\nthroughout their existence, have thought and written well in the full\r\nsense of the word. Among the ancients, Latin literature is null at the\r\nbeginning, and afterward borrowed and an imitation. Among the moderns,\r\nGerman literature is nearly a blank for two centuries.[7] Italian and\r\nSpanish literatures come to an end in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Ancient Greece, and modern France and England, alone offer a\r\ncomplete series of great and expressive monuments. I have chosen the\r\nEnglish because, as this still exists and is open to direct observation,\r\nit can be better studied than that of an extinct civilization of which\r\nfragments only remain; and because, being different, it offers better\r\nthan that of France very marked characteristics in the eyes of a\r\nFrenchman. Moreover, outside of what is peculiar to English\r\ncivilization, apart from a spontaneous development, it presents a forced\r\ndeviation due to the latest and most effective conquest to which the\r\ncountry was subject; the three given conditions out of which it\r\nissues--race, climate, and the Norman conquest--are clearly and\r\ndistinctly visible in its literary monuments; so that we study in this\r\nhistory the two most potent motors of human transformation, namely,\r\nnature and constraint, and we study them, without any break or\r\nuncertainty, in a series of authentic and complete monuments. I have\r\ntried to define these primitive motors, to show their gradual effects,\r\nand explain how their insensible operation has brought religions and\r\nliterary productions into full light, and how the inward mechanism is\r\ndeveloped by which the barbarous Saxon became the Englishman of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Darwin, \"The Origin of Species.\" Prosper Lucas, \"De\r\nl'Hérédité.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Spinosa, \"Ethics,\" part IV., axiom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For this scale of coordinate effects consult, \"Langues\r\nSémitiques,\" by Renan, ch.

In Holland the\r\nsoil is but a sediment of mud; here and there only does the earth cover\r\nit with a crust, shallow and brittle, the mere alluvium of the river,\r\nwhich the river seems ever about to destroy. Thick clouds hover above,\r\nbeing fed by ceaseless exhalations. They lazily turn their violet\r\nflanks, grow black, suddenly descend in heavy showers; the vapor, like a\r\nfurnace-smoke, crawls forever on the horizon. Thus watered, plants\r\nmultiply; in the angle between Jutland and the continent, in a fat muddy\r\nsoil, \"the verdure is as fresh as that of England.\"[8] Immense forests\r\ncovered the land even after the eleventh century. The sap of this humid\r\ncountry, thick and potent, circulates in man as in the plants; man's\r\nrespiration, nutrition, sensations and habits affect also his faculties\r\nand his frame.\r\n\r\nThe land produced after this fashion has one enemy, to wit, the sea.\r\nHolland maintains its existence only by virtue of its dykes. In 1654\r\nthose in Jutland burst, and fifteen thousand of the inhabitants were\r\nswallowed up. One need only see the blast of the North swirl down upon\r\nthe low level of the soil, wan and ominous:[9] the vast yellow sea\r\ndashes against the narrow belt of flat coast which seems incapable of a\r\nmoment's resistance; the wind howls and bellows; the sea-mews cry; the\r\npoor little ships flee as fast as they can, bending almost to the\r\ngunwale, and endeavor to find a refuge in the mouth of the river, which\r\nseems as hostile as the sea. A sad and precarious existence, as it were\r\nface to face with a beast of prey. The Frisians, in their ancient laws,\r\nspeak already of the league they have made against \"the ferocious\r\nocean.\" Even in a calm this sea is unsafe. \"Before me rolleth a waste of\r\nwater... and above me go rolling the storm-clouds, the formless dark\r\ngray daughters of air, which from the sea, in cloudy buckets scoop up\r\nthe water, ever wearied lifting and lifting, and then pour it again in\r\nthe sea, a mournful, wearisome business. Over the sea, flat on his face,\r\nlies the monstrous terrible North wind, sighing and sinking his voice as\r\nin secret, like an old grumbler, for once in good humor, unto the ocean\r\nhe talks, and he tells her wonderful stories.\"[10] Rain, wind, and surge\r\nleave room for naught but gloomy and melancholy thoughts. The very joy\r\nof the billows has in it an inexplicable restlessness and harshness.\r\nFrom Holland to Jutland, a string of small deluged islands[11] bears\r\nwitness to their ravages; the shifting sands which the tide drifts up\r\nobstruct and impede the banks and entrance of the rivers.[12] The first\r\nRoman fleet, a thousand sail, perished there; to this day ships wait a\r\nmonth or more in sight of port, tossed upon the great white waves, not\r\ndaring to risk themselves in the shifting winding channel, notorious for\r\nits wrecks. In winter a breast-plate of ice covers the two streams; the\r\nsea drives back the frozen masses as they descend; they pile themselves\r\nwith a crash upon the sandbanks, and sway to and fro; now and then you\r\nmay see a vessel, seized as in a vice, split in two beneath their\r\nviolence. Picture, in this foggy clime, amid hoar-frost and storm, in\r\nthese marshes and forests, half-naked savages, a kind of wild beasts,\r\nfishers and hunters, but especially hunters of men; these are they,\r\nSaxons, Angles, Jutes, Frisians;[13] later on, Danes, who during the\r\nfifth and the ninth centuries, with their swords and battle-axes, took\r\nand kept the island of Britain.\r\n\r\nA rude and foggy land, like their own, except in the depth of its sea\r\nand the safety of its coasts, which one day will call up real fleets and\r\nmighty vessels; green England--the word rises to the lips and expresses\r\nall. Here also moisture pervades everything; even in summer the mist\r\nrises; even on clear days you perceive it fresh from the great\r\nsea-girdle, or rising from vast but ever slushy meadows, undulating with\r\nhill and dale, intersected with hedges to the limit of the horizon. Here\r\nand there a sunbeam strikes on the higher grasses with burning flash,\r\nand the splendor of the verdure dazzles and almost blinds you. The\r\noverflowing water straightens the flabby stems; they grow up, rank,\r\nweak, and filled with sap; a sap ever renewed, for the gray mists creep\r\nunder a stratum of motionless vapor, and at distant intervals the rim of\r\nheaven is drenched by heavy showers. \"There are yet commons as at the\r\ntime of the Conquest, deserted, abandoned,[14] wild, covered with furze\r\nand thorny plants, with here and there a horse grazing in solitude.\r\nJoyless scene, unproductive soil![15] What a labor it has been to\r\nhumanize it! What impression it must have made on the men of the South,\r\nthe Romans of Cæsar! I thought, when I saw it, of the ancient Saxons,\r\nwanderers from West and North, who came to settle in this land of marsh\r\nand fogs, on the border of primeval forests, on the banks of these great\r\nmuddy streams, which roll down their slime to meet the waves.[16] They\r\nmust have lived as hunters and swineherds; growing, as before, brawny,\r\nfierce, gloomy. Take civilization from this soil, and there will remain\r\nto the inhabitants only war, the chase, gluttony, drunkenness. Smiling\r\nlove, sweet poetic dreams, art, refined and nimble thought, are for the\r\nhappy shores of the Mediterranean. Here the barbarian, ill housed in his\r\nmud-hovel, who hears the rain pattering whole days among the oak\r\nleaves--what dreams can he have, gazing upon his mud-pools and his\r\nsombre sky?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--The Northern Barbarians\r\n\r\n\r\nHuge white bodies, cool-blooded, with fierce blue eyes, reddish flaxen\r\nhair; ravenous stomachs, filled with meat and cheese, heated by strong\r\ndrinks; of a cold temperament, slow to love,[17] home-stayers, prone to\r\nbrutal drunkenness: these are to this day the features which descent and\r\nclimate preserve in the race, and these are what the Roman historians\r\ndiscovered in their former country. There is no living, in these lands,\r\nwithout abundance of solid food; bad weather keeps people at home;\r\nstrong drinks are necessary to cheer them; the senses become blunted,\r\nthe muscles are braced, the will vigorous. In every country the body of\r\nman is rooted deep into the soil of nature; and in this instance still\r\ndeeper, because, being uncultivated, he is less removed from nature. In\r\nGermany storm-beaten, in wretched boats of hide, amid the hardships and\r\ndangers of seafaring life, they were pre-eminently adapted for endurance\r\nand enterprise, inured to misfortune, scorners of danger. Pirates at\r\nfirst: of all kinds of hunting the man-hunt is most profitable and most\r\nnoble; they left the care of the land and flocks to the women and\r\nslaves; seafaring, war, and pillage[18] was their whole idea of a\r\nfreeman's work. They dashed to sea in their two-sailed barks, landed\r\nanywhere, killed everything; and having sacrificed in honor of their\r\ngods the tithe of their prisoners, and leaving behind them the red light\r\nof their burnings, went farther on to begin again. \"Lord,\" says a\r\ncertain litany, \"deliver us from the fury of the Jutes. Of all\r\nbarbarians[19] these are strongest of body and heart, the most\r\nformidable,\"--we may add, the most cruelly ferocious. When murder\r\nbecomes a trade, it becomes a pleasure. About the eighth century, the\r\nfinal decay of the great Roman corpse which Charlemagne had tried to\r\nrevive, and which was settling down into corruption, called them like\r\nvultures to the prey. Those who had remained in Denmark, with their\r\nbrothers of Norway, fanatical pagans, incensed against the Christians,\r\nmade a descent on all the surrounding coasts. Their sea-kings,[20] \"who\r\nhad never slept under the smoky rafters of a roof, who had never drained\r\nthe ale-horn by an inhabited hearth,\" laughed at wind and storms, and\r\nsang: \"The blast of the tempest aids our oars; the bellowing of heaven,\r\nthe howling of the thunder, hurt us not; the hurricane is our servant,\r\nand drives us whither we wish to go. We hewed with our swords,\" says a\r\nsong attributed to Ragnar Lodbrog; \"was it not like that hour when my\r\nbright bride I seated by me on the couch?\" One of them, at the monastery\r\nof Peterborough, kills with his own hand all the monks, to the number of\r\neighty-four; others, having taken King Ælla, divided his ribs from the\r\nspine, drew his lungs out, threw salt into his wounds. Harold Harefoot,\r\nhaving seized his rival Alfred, with six hundred men, had them maimed,\r\nblinded, hamstrung, scalped, or embowelled.[21] Torture and carnage,\r\ngreed of danger, fury of destruction, obstinate and frenzied bravery of\r\nan over-strong temperament, the unchaining of the butcherly\r\ninstincts--such traits meet us at every step in the old Sagas. The\r\ndaughter of the Danish Jarl, seeing Egil taking his seat near her,\r\nrepels him with scorn, reproaching him with \"seldom having provided the\r\nwolves with hot meat, with never having seen for the whole autumn a\r\nraven croaking over the carnage.\" But Egil seized her and pacified her\r\nby singing: \"I have marched with my bloody sword, and the raven has\r\nfollowed me. Furiously we fought, the fire passed over the dwellings of\r\nmen; we have sent to sleep in blood those who kept the gates.\" From such\r\ntable-talk, and such maidenly tastes, we may judge of the rest.[22]\r\n\r\nBehold them now in England, more settled and wealthier: do you expect to\r\nfind them much changed? Changed it may be, but for the worse, like the\r\nFranks, like all barbarians who pass from action to enjoyment. They are\r\nmore gluttonous, carving their hogs, filling themselves with flesh,\r\nswallowing down deep draughts of mead, ale, spiced wines, all the\r\nstrong, coarse drinks which they can procure, and so they are cheered\r\nand stimulated. Add to this the pleasure of the fight. Not easily with\r\nsuch instincts can they attain to culture; to find a natural and ready\r\nculture, we must look amongst the sober and sprightly populations of the\r\nsouth. Here the sluggish and heavy[23] temperament remains long buried\r\nin a brutal life; people of the Latin race never at a first glance see\r\nin them aught but large gross beasts, clumsy and ridiculous when not\r\ndangerous and enraged. Up to the sixteenth century, says an old\r\nhistorian, the great body of the nation were little else than herdsmen,\r\nkeepers of cattle and sheep; up to the end of the eighteenth drunkenness\r\nwas the recreation of the higher ranks; it is still that of the lower;\r\nand all the refinement and softening influence of civilization have not\r\nabolished amongst them the use of the rod and the fist. If the\r\ncarnivorous, warlike, drinking savage, proof against the climate, still\r\nshows beneath the conventions of our modern society and the softness of\r\nour modern polish, imagine what he must have been when, landing with his\r\nband upon a wasted or desert country, and becoming for the first time a\r\nsettler, he saw extending to the horizon the common pastures of the\r\nborder country, and the great primitive forests which furnished stags\r\nfor the chase and acorns for his pigs. The ancient histories tell us\r\nthat they had a great and a coarse appetite.[24] Even at the time of the\r\nConquest the custom of drinking to excess was a common vice with men of\r\nthe highest rank, and they passed in this way whole days and nights\r\nwithout intermission. Henry of Huntingdon, in the twelfth century,\r\nlamenting the ancient hospitality, says that the Norman kings provided\r\ntheir courtiers with only one meal a day, while the Saxon kings used to\r\nprovide four. One day, when Athelstan went with his nobles to visit his\r\nrelative Ethelfleda, the provision of mead was exhausted at the first\r\nsalutation, owing to the copiousness of the draughts; but Dunstan,\r\nforecasting the extent of the royal appetite, had furnish the house so\r\nthat the cup-bearers, as is the custom at royal feasts, were able the\r\nwhole day to serve it out in horns and other vessels, and the liquor was\r\nnot found to be deficient. When the guests were satisfied, the harp\r\npassed from hand to hand, and the rude harmony of their deep voices\r\nswelled under the vaulted roof. The monasteries themselves in Edgard's\r\ntime kept up games, songs, and dances till midnight. To shout, to drink,\r\nto gesticulate, to feel their veins heated and swollen with wine, to\r\nhear and see around them the riotous orgies, this was the first need of\r\nthe barbarians.[25] The heavy human brute gluts himself with sensations\r\nand with noise.\r\n\r\nFor such appetites there was a stronger food--I mean blows and battle.\r\nIn vain they attached themselves to the soil, became tillers of the\r\nground, in distinct communities and distinct regions, shut[26] in their\r\nmarch with their kindred and comrades, bound together, separated from\r\nthe mass, enclosed by sacred landmarks, by primeval oaks on which they\r\ncut the figures of birds and beasts, by poles set up in the midst of the\r\nmarsh, which whosoever removed was punished with cruel tortures. In vain\r\nthese Marches and Ga's[27] were grouped into states, and finally formed\r\na half-regulated society, with assemblies and laws, under the lead of a\r\nsingle king; its very structure indicates the necessities to supply\r\nwhich it was created. They united in order to maintain peace; treaties\r\nof peace occupy their Parliaments; provisions for peace are the matter\r\nof their laws. War was waged daily and everywhere; the aim of life was,\r\nnot to be slain, ransomed, mutilated, pillaged, hanged, and of course,\r\nif it was a woman, violated.[28] Every man was obliged to appear armed,\r\nand to be ready, with his burgh or his township, to repel marauders, who\r\nwent about in bands.[29] The animal was yet too powerful, too impetuous,\r\ntoo untamed. Anger and covetousness in the first place brought him upon\r\nhis prey. Their history, I mean that of the Heptarchy, is like a history\r\nof \"kites and crows.\"[30] They slew the Britons or reduced them to\r\nslavery, fought the remnant of the Welsh, Irish, and Picts, massacred\r\none another, were hewn down and cut to pieces by the Danes. In a hundred\r\nyears, out of fourteen kings of Northumbria, seven were slain and six\r\ndeposed. Penda of Mercia killed five kings, and in order to take the\r\ntown of Bamborough, demolished all the neighboring villages, heaped\r\ntheir ruins into an immense pile, sufficient to burn all the\r\ninhabitants, undertook to exterminate the Northumbrians, and perished\r\nhimself by the sword at the age of eighty. Many amongst them were put to\r\ndeath by the thanes; one thane was burned alive; brothers slew one\r\nanother treacherously. With us civilization has interposed, between the\r\ndesire and its fulfilment, the counteracting and softening preventive of\r\nreflection and calculation; here, the impulse is sudden, and murder and\r\nevery kind of excess spring from it instantaneously. King Edwy[31]\r\nhaving married Elgiva, his relation within the prohibited degrees,\r\nquitted the hall where he was drinking on the very day of his\r\ncoronation, to be with her. The nobles thought themselves insulted, and\r\nimmediately Abbot Dunstan went himself to seek the young man. \"He found\r\nthe adulteress,\" says the monk Osbern, \"her mother, and the king\r\ntogether on the bed of debauch. He dragged the king thence violently,\r\nand setting the crown upon his head, brought him back to the nobles.\"\r\nAfterwards Elgiva sent men to put out Dunstan's eyes, and then, in a\r\nrevolt, saved herself and the king by hiding in the country; but the men\r\nof the North having seized her, \"hamstrung her, and then subjected her\r\nto the death which she deserved.\"[32] Barbarity follows barbarity. At\r\nBristol, at the time of the Conquest, as we are told by a historian of\r\nthe time,[33] it was the custom to buy men and women in all parts of\r\nEngland, and to carry them to Ireland for sale in order to make money.\r\nThe buyers usually made the young women pregnant, and took them to\r\nmarket in that condition, in order to insure a better price. \"You might\r\nhave seen with sorrow long files of young people of both sexes and of\r\nthe greatest beauty, bound with ropes, and daily exposed for sale. ...\r\nThey sold in this manner as slaves their nearest relatives, and even\r\ntheir own children.\" And the chronicler adds that, having abandoned this\r\npractice, they \"thus set an example to all the rest of England.\" Would\r\nyou know the manners of the highest ranks, in the family of the last\r\nking?[34] At a feast in the king's hall, Harold was serving Edward the\r\nConfessor with wine, when Tostig, his brother, moved by envy, seized him\r\nby the hair. They were separated. Tostig went to Hereford, where Harold\r\nhad ordered a royal banquet to be prepared. There he seized his\r\nbrother's attendants, and cutting off their heads and limbs, he placed\r\nthem in the vessels of wine, ale, mead, and cider, and sent a message to\r\nthe king: \"If you go to your farm, you will find there plenty of salt\r\nmeat, but you will do well to carry some more with you.\" Harold's other\r\nbrother, Sweyn, had violated the abbess Elgiva, assassinated Beorn the\r\nthane, and being banished from the country had turned pirate. When we\r\nregard their deeds of violence, their ferocity, their cannibal jests, we\r\nsee that they were not far removed from the sea-kings, or from the\r\nfollowers of Odin, who ate raw flesh, hung men as victims on the sacred\r\ntrees of Upsala, and killed themselves to make sure of dying as they had\r\nlived, in blood. A score of times the old ferocious instinct reappears\r\nbeneath the thin crust of Christianity. In the eleventh century,\r\nSiward,[35] the great Earl of Northumberland, was afflicted with a\r\ndysentery; and feeling his death near, exclaimed, \"What a shame for me\r\nnot to have been permitted to die in so many battles, and to end thus by\r\na cow's death! At least put on my breastplate, gird on my sword, set my\r\nhelmet on my head, my shield in my left hand, my battle-axe in my right,\r\nso that a stout warrior, like myself, may die as a warrior.\" They did as\r\nhe bade, and thus died he honorably in his armor. They had made one\r\nstep, and only one, from barbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Saxon Ideas\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this native barbarism there were noble dispositions, unknown to\r\nthe Roman world, which were destined to produce a better people out of\r\nits ruins. In the first place, \"a certain earnestness, which leads them\r\nout of frivolous sentiments to noble ones.\"[36] From their origin in\r\nGermany this is what we find them, severe in manners, with grave\r\ninclinations and a manly dignity. They live solitary, each one near the\r\nspring or the wood which has taken his fancy.[37] Even in villages the\r\ncottages were detached; they must have independence and free air. They\r\nhad no taste for voluptuousness; love was tardy, education severe, their\r\nfood simple; all the recreation they indulged in was the hunting of the\r\naurochs, and a dance amongst naked swords. Violent intoxication and\r\nperilous wagers were their weakest points; they sought in preference not\r\nmild pleasures, but strong excitement. In everything, even in their rude\r\nand masculine instincts, they were men. Each in his own home, on his\r\nland and in his hut, was his own master, upright and free, in no wise\r\nrestrained or shackled. If the commonweal received anything from him, it\r\nwas because he gave it. He gave his vote in arms in all great\r\nconferences, passed judgment in the assembly, made alliances and wars on\r\nhis own account, moved from place to place, showed activity and\r\ndaring.[38] The modern Englishman existed entire in this Saxon. If he\r\nbends, it is because he is quite willing to bend; he is no less capable\r\nof self-denial than of independence; self-sacrifice is not uncommon, a\r\nman cares not for his blood or his life. In Homer the warrior often\r\ngives way, and is not blamed if he flees. In the Sagas, in the Edda, he\r\nmust be over-brave; in Germany the coward is drowned in the mud, under a\r\nhurdle. Through all outbreaks of primitive brutality gleams obscurely\r\nthe grand idea of duty, which is, the self-constraint exercised in view\r\nof some noble end. Marriage was pure amongst them, chastity instinctive.\r\nAmongst the Saxons the adulterer was punished by death; the adulteress\r\nwas obliged to hang herself, or was stabbed by the knives of her\r\ncompanions. The wives of the Cimbrians, when they could not obtain from\r\nMarius assurance of their chastity, slew themselves with their own\r\nhands. They thought there was something sacred in a woman; they married\r\nbut one, and kept faith with her. In fifteen centuries the idea of\r\nmarriage is unchanged amongst them. The wife, on entering her husband's\r\nhome, is aware that she gives herself altogether,[39] \"that she will\r\nhave but one body, one life with him; that she will have no thought, no\r\ndesire beyond; that she will be the companion of his perils and labors;\r\nthat she will suffer and dare as much as he, both in peace and war.\" And\r\nhe, like her, knows that he gives himself. Having chosen his chief, he\r\nforgets himself in him, assigns to him his own glory, serves him to the\r\ndeath. \"He is infamous as long as he lives, who returns from the field\r\nof battle without his chief.\"[40] It was on this voluntary subordination\r\nthat feudal society was based. Man in this race can accept a superior,\r\ncan be capable of devotion and respect. Thrown back upon himself by the\r\ngloom and severity of his climate, he has discovered moral beauty while\r\nothers discover sensuous beauty. This kind of naked brute, who lies all\r\nday by his fireside, sluggish and dirty, always eating and drinking,[41]\r\nwhose rusty faculties cannot follow the clear and fine outlines of\r\nhappily created poetic forms, catches a glimpse of the sublime in his\r\ntroubled dreams. He does not see it, but simply feels it; his religion\r\nis already within, as it will be in the sixteenth century, when he will\r\ncast off the sensuous worship imported from Rome, and hallow the faith\r\nof the heart.[42] His gods are not enclosed in walls; he has no idols.\r\nWhat he designates by divine names is something invisible and grand,\r\nwhich floats through nature, and is conceived beyond nature,[43] a\r\nmysterious infinity which the sense cannot touch, but which \"reverence\r\nalone can feel\"; and when, later on, the legends define and alter this\r\nvague divination of natural powers, one idea remains at the bottom of\r\nthis chaos of giant-dreams, namely, that the world is a warfare, and\r\nheroism the highest good.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, say the old Icelandic legends,[44] there were two\r\nworlds, Niflheim the frozen, and Muspell the burning. From the falling\r\nsnow-flakes was born the giant Ymir. \"There was in times of old, where\r\nYmir dwelt, nor sand nor sea, nor gelid waves; earth existed not, nor\r\nheaven above; 'twas a chaotic chasm, and grass nowhere.\" There was but\r\nYmir, the horrible frozen Ocean, with his children, sprung from his feet\r\nand his armpits; then their shapeless progeny, Terrors of the abyss,\r\nbarren Mountains, Whirlwinds of the North, and other malevolent beings,\r\nenemies of the sun and of life; then the cow Andhumbla, born also of\r\nmelting snow, brings to light, whilst licking the hoar-frost from the\r\nrocks, a man Bur, whose grandsons kill the giant Ymir. \"From his flesh\r\nthe earth was formed, and from his bones the hills, the heaven from the\r\nskull of that ice-cold giant, and from his blood the sea; but of his\r\nbrains the heavy clouds are all created.\" Then arose war between the\r\nmonsters of winter and the luminous fertile gods, Odin the founder,\r\nBaldur the mild and benevolent, Thor the summer-thunder, who purifies\r\nthe air, and nourishes the earth with showers. Long fought the gods\r\nagainst the frozen Jötuns, against the dark bestial powers, the Wolf\r\nFenrir, the great Serpent, whom they drown in the sea, the treacherous\r\nLoki, whom they bind to the rocks, beneath a viper whose venom drops\r\ncontinually on his face. Long will the heroes who by a bloody death\r\ndeserve to be placed \"in the halls of Odin, and there wage a combat\r\nevery day,\" assist the gods in their mighty war. A day will, however,\r\narrive when gods and men will be conquered. Then\r\n\r\n\r\n\"trembles Yggdrasil's ash yet standing; groans that ancient tree, and\r\nthe Jötun Loki is loosed. The shadows groan on the ways of Hel,[45]\r\nuntil the fire of Surt has consumed the tree. Hrym steers from the east,\r\nthe waters rise, the mundane snake is coiled in jötun-rage. The worm\r\nbeats the water, and the eagle screams; the pale of beak tears\r\ncarcasses; (the ship) Naglfar is loosed. Surt from the South comes with\r\nflickering flame; shines from his sword the Val-god's sun. The stony\r\nhills are dashed together, the giantesses totter; men tread the path of\r\nHel, and heaven is cloven. The sun darkens, earth in ocean sinks, fall\r\nfrom heaven the bright stars, fire's breath assails the all-nourishing\r\ntree, towering fire plays against heaven itself.\"[46]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gods perish, devoured one by one by the monsters; and the celestial\r\nlegend, sad and grand now like the life of man, bears witness to the\r\nhearts of warriors and heroes.\r\n\r\nThere is no fear of pain, no care for life; they count it as dross when\r\nthe idea has seized upon them. The trembling of the nerves, the\r\nrepugnance of animal instinct which starts back before wounds and death,\r\nare all lost in an irresistible determination. See how in their epic[47]\r\nthe sublime springs up amid the horrible, like a bright purple flower\r\namid a pool of blood. Sigurd has plunged his sword into the dragon\r\nFafnir, and at that very moment they looked on one another; and Fafnir\r\nasks, as he dies, \"Who art thou? and who is thy father? and what thy\r\nkin, that thou wert so hardy as to bear weapons against me? A hardy\r\nheart urged me on thereto, and a strong hand and this sharp sword....\r\nSeldom hath hardy eld a faint-heart youth.\" After this triumphant\r\neagle's cry Sigurd cuts out the worm's heart; but Regin, brother of\r\nFafnir, drinks blood from the wound, and falls asleep. Sigurd, who was\r\nroasting the heart, raises his finger thoughtlessly to his lips.\r\nForthwith he understands the language of the birds. The eagles scream\r\nabove him in the branches. They warn him to mistrust Regin. Sigurd cuts\r\noff the latter's head, eats of Fafnir's heart, drinks his blood and his\r\nbrother's. Amongst all these murders their courage and poetry grow.\r\nSigurd has subdued Brynhild, the untamed maiden, by passing through the\r\nflaming fire; they share one couch for three nights, his naked sword\r\nbetwixt them. \"Nor the damsel did he kiss, nor did the Hunnish king to\r\nhis arm lift her. He the blooming maid to Giuki's son delivered,\"\r\nbecause, according to his oath, he must send her to her betrothed\r\nGunnar. She, setting her love upon him, \"Alone she sat without, at eve\r\nof day, began aloud with herself to speak: 'Sigurd must be mine; I must\r\ndie, or that blooming youth clasp in my arms.'\" But seeing him married,\r\nshe brings about his death. \"Laughed then Brynhild, Budli's daughter,\r\nonce only, from her whole soul, when in her bed she listened to the loud\r\nlament of Giuki's daughter.\" She put on her golden corslet, pierced\r\nherself with the sword's point, and as a last request said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let in the plain be raised a pile so spacious, that for us all like\r\nroom may be; let them burn the Hun (Sigurd) on the one side of me, on\r\nthe other side my household slaves, with collars splendid, two at our\r\nheads, and two hawks; let also lie between us both the keen-edged sword,\r\nas when we both one couch ascended; also five female thralls, eight male\r\nslaves of gentle birth fostered with me.\"[48]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll were burnt together; yet Gudrun the widow continued motionless by\r\nthe corpse, and could not weep. The wives of the jarls came to console\r\nher, and each of them told her own sorrows, all the calamities of great\r\ndevastations and the old life of barbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then spoke Giaflang, Giuki's sister: 'Lo, up on earth I live most\r\nloveless, who of five mates must see the ending, of daughters twain and\r\nthree sisters, of brethren eight, and abide behind lonely.' Then spake\r\nHerborg, Queen of Hunland: 'Crueller tale have I to tell of my seven\r\nsons, down in the Southlands, and the eight man, my mate, felled in the\r\ndeath-mead. Father and mother, and four brothers on the wide sea the\r\nwinds and death played with; the billows beat on the bulwark boards.\r\nAlone must I sing o'er them, alone must I array them, alone must my\r\nhands deal with their departing; and all this was in one season's\r\nwearing, and none was left for love or solace. Then was I bound a prey\r\nof the battle when that same season wore to its ending; as a tiring may\r\nmust I bind the shoon of the duke's high dame, every day at dawning.\r\nFrom her jealous hate gat I heavy mocking, cruel lashes she laid upon\r\nme.\"[49]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll was in vain; no word could draw tears from those dry eyes. They were\r\nobliged to lay the bloody corpse before her, ere her tears would come.\r\nThen tears flowed through the pillow; as \"the geese withal that were in\r\nthe home-field, the fair fowls the may owned, fell a-screaming.\" She\r\nwould have died, like Sigrun, on the corpse of him whom alone she had\r\nloved, if they had not deprived her of memory by a magic potion. Thus\r\naffected, she departs in order to marry Atli, king of the Huns; and yet\r\nshe goes against her will, with gloomy forebodings: for murder begets\r\nmurder; and her brothers, the murderers of Sigurd, having been drawn to\r\nAtli's court, fall in their turn into a snare like that which they had\r\nthemselves laid. Then Gunnar was bound, and they tried to make him\r\ndeliver up the treasure. He answers with a barbarian's laugh:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Högni's heart in my hand shall lie, cut bloody from the breast of the\r\nvaliant chief, the king's son, with a dull-edged knife.' They the heart\r\ncut out from Hialli's breast; on a dish, bleeding, laid it, and it to\r\nGunnar bare. Then said Gunnar, lord of men: 'Here have I the heart of\r\nthe timid Hialli, unlike the heart of the bold Högni; for much it\r\ntrembles as in the dish it lies; it trembled more by half while in his\r\nbreast it lay.' Högni laughed when to his heart they cut the living\r\ncrest-crasher; no lament uttered he. All bleeding on a dish they laid\r\nit, and it to Gunnar bare. Calmly said Gunnar, the warrior Niflung:\r\n'Here have I the heart of the bold Högni, unlike the heart of the timid\r\nHialli; for it little trembles as in the dish it lies: it trembled less\r\nwhile in his breast it lay. So far shalt thou, Atli! be from the eyes of\r\nmen as thou wilt from the treasures be. In my power alone is all the\r\nhidden Niflung's gold, now that Högni lives not. Ever was I wavering\r\nwhile we both lived: now am I so no longer, as I alone survive.'\"[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last insult of the self-confident man, who values neither his\r\nown life nor that of another, so that he can satiate his vengeance. They\r\ncast him into the serpent's den, and there he died, striking his harp\r\nwith his foot. But the inextinguishable flame of vengeance passed from\r\nhis heart to that of his sister. Corpse after corpse fall on each other;\r\na mighty fury hurls them open-eyed to death. She killed the children she\r\nhad by Atli, and one day on his return from the carnage, gave him their\r\nhearts to eat, served in honey, and laughed coldly as she told him on\r\nwhat he had fed. \"Uproar was on the benches, portentous the cry of men,\r\nnoise beneath the costly hangings. The children of the Huns wept; all\r\nwept save Gudrun, who never wept or for her bear-fierce brothers, or for\r\nher dear sons, young, simple.\"[51] Judge from this heap of ruin and\r\ncarnage to what excess the will is strung. There were men amongst them,\r\nBerserkirs,[52] who in battle seized with a sort of madness, showed a\r\nsudden and superhuman strength, and ceased to feel their wounds. This is\r\nthe conception of a hero as engendered by this race in its infancy. Is\r\nit not strange to see them place their happiness in battle, their beauty\r\nin death? Is there any people, Hindoo, Persian, Greek, or Gallic, which\r\nhas formed so tragic a conception of life? Is there any which has\r\npeopled its infantine mind with such gloomy dreams? Is there any which\r\nhas so entirely banished from its dreams the sweetness of enjoyment, and\r\nthe softness of pleasure? Endeavors, tenacious and mournful endeavors,\r\nan ecstasy of endeavors--such was their chosen condition. Carlyle said\r\nwell, that in the sombre obstinacy of an English laborer still survives\r\nthe tacit rage of the Scandinavian warrior. Strife for strife's\r\nsake--such is their pleasure. With what sadness, madness, destruction,\r\nsuch a disposition breaks its bonds, we shall see in Shakespeare and\r\nByron; with what vigor and purpose it can limit and employ itself when\r\npossessed by moral ideas, we shall see in the case of the Puritans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Saxon Heroes\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have established themselves in England; and however disordered the\r\nsociety which binds them together, it is founded, as in Germany, on\r\ngenerous sentiment. War is at every door, I am aware, but warlike\r\nvirtues are within every house; courage chiefly, then fidelity. Under\r\nthe brute there is a free man, and a man of spirit. There is no man\r\namongst them who, at his own risk,[53] will not make alliance, go forth\r\nto fight, undertake adventures. There is no group of free men amongst\r\nthem, who, in their Witenagemote, is not forever concluding alliances\r\none with another. Every clan, in its own district, forms a league of\r\nwhich all the members, \"brothers of the sword,\" defend each other, and\r\ndemand revenge for the spilling of blood, at the price of their own.\r\nEvery chief in his hall reckons that he has friends, not mercenaries, in\r\nthe faithful ones who drink his beer, and who, having received as marks\r\nof his esteem and confidence, bracelets, swords, and suits of armor,\r\nwill cast themselves between him and danger on the day of battle.[54]\r\nIndependence and boldness rage amongst this young nation with violence\r\nand excess; but these are of themselves noble things; and no less noble\r\nare the sentiments which serve them for discipline--to wit, an\r\naffectionate devotion, and respect for plighted faith. These appear in\r\ntheir laws, and break forth in their poetry. Amongst them greatness of\r\nheart gives matter for imagination. Their characters are not selfish and\r\nshifty, like those of Homer. They are brave hearts, simple and strong,\r\nfaithful to their relatives, to their master in arms, firm and steadfast\r\nto enemies and friends, abounding in courage, and ready for sacrifice.\r\n\"Old as I am,\" says one, \"I will not budge hence. I mean to die by my\r\nlord's side, near this man I have loved so much. He kept his word, the\r\nword he had given to his chief, to the distributor of gifts, promising\r\nhim that they should return to the town, safe and sound to their homes,\r\nor that they would fall both together, in the thick of the carnage,\r\ncovered with wounds. He lies by his master's side, like a faithful\r\nservant.\" Though awkward in speech, their old poets find touching words\r\nwhen they have to paint these manly friendships. We cannot without\r\nemotion hear them relate how the old \"king embraced the best of his\r\nthanes, and put his arms about his neck, how the tears flowed down the\r\ncheeks of the gray-haired chief.... The valiant man was so dear to him.\r\nHe could not stop the flood which mounted from his breast. In his heart,\r\ndeep in the chords of his soul, he sighed in secret after the beloved\r\nman.\" Few as are the songs which remain to us, they return to this\r\nsubject again and again. The wanderer in a reverie dreams about his\r\nlord:[55] It seems to him in his spirit as if he kisses and embraces\r\nhim, and lays head and hands upon his knees, as oft before in the olden\r\ntime, when he rejoiced in his gifts. Then he wakes--a man without\r\nfriends. He sees before him the desert tracks, the seabirds dipping in\r\nthe waves, stretching wide their wings, the frost and the snow, mingled\r\nwith falling hail. Then his heart's wounds press more heavily. The exile\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In blithe habits full oft we, too, agreed that nought else should\r\ndivide us except death alone; at length this is changed, and as if it\r\nhad never been is now our friendship. To endure enmities man orders me\r\nto dwell in the bowers of the forest, under the oak-tree in this earthy\r\ncave. Cold is this earth-dwelling: I am quite wearied out. Dim are the\r\ndells, high up are the mountains, a bitter city of twigs, with briars\r\novergrown, a joyless abode.... My friends are in the earth; those loved\r\nin life, the tomb holds them. The grave is guarding, while I above alone\r\nam going. Under the oak-tree, beyond this earth-cave, there I must sit\r\nthe long summer-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid their perilous mode of life, and the perpetual appeal to arms,\r\nthere exists no sentiment more warm than friendship, nor any virtue\r\nstronger than loyalty.\r\n\r\nThus supported by powerful affection and trysted word, society is kept\r\nwholesome. Marriage is like the state. We find women associating with\r\nthe men, at their feasts, sober and respected.[56] She speaks, and they\r\nlisten to her; no need for concealing or enslaving her, in order to\r\nrestrain or retain her. She is a person and not a thing. The law demands\r\nher consent to marriage, surrounds her with guarantees, accords her\r\nprotection. She can inherit, possess, bequeath, appear in courts of\r\njustice, in county assemblies, in the great congress of the elders.\r\nFrequently the name of the queen and of several other ladies is\r\ninscribed in the proceedings of the Witenagemote. Law and tradition\r\nmaintain her integrity, as if she were a man, and side by side with men.\r\nHer affections captivate her, as if she were a man, and side by side\r\nwith men. In Alfred[57] there is a portrait of the wife, which for\r\npurity and elevation equals all that we can devise with our modern\r\nrefinements. \"Thy wife now lives for thee--for thee alone. She has\r\nenough of all kind of wealth for this present life, but she scorns them\r\nall for thy sake alone. She has forsaken them all, because she had not\r\nthee with them. Thy absence makes her think that all she possesses is\r\nnought. Thus, for love of thee, she is wasted away, and lies near death\r\nfor tears and grief.\" Already, in the legends of the Edda, we have seen\r\nthe maiden Sigrun at the tomb of Helgi, \"as glad as the voracious hawks\r\nof Odin, when they of slaughter know, of warm prey,\" desiring to sleep\r\nstill in the arms of death, and die at last on his grave. Nothing here\r\nlike the love we find in the primitive poetry of France, Provence,\r\nSpain, and Greece. There is an absence of gayety, of delight; outside of\r\nmarriage it is only a ferocious appetite, an outbreak of the instinct of\r\nthe beast. It appears nowhere with its charm and its smile; there is no\r\nlove-song in this ancient poetry. The reason is, that with them love is\r\nnot an amusement and a pleasure, but a promise and a devotion. All is\r\ngrave, even sombre, in civil relations as well as in conjugal society.\r\nAs in Germany, amid the sadness of a melancholic temperament and the\r\nsavagery of a barbarous life, the most tragic human faculties, the deep\r\npower of love and the grand power of will, are the only ones that sway\r\nand act.\r\n\r\nThis is why the hero, as in Germany, is truly heroic. Let us speak of\r\nhim at length; we possess one of their poems, that of Beowulf, almost\r\nentire. Here are the stories, which the thanes, seated on their stools,\r\nby the light of their torches, listened to as they drank the ale of\r\ntheir king: we can glean thence their manners and sentiments, as in the\r\nIliad and the Odyssey those of the Greeks. Beowulf is a hero, a\r\nknight-errant before the days of chivalry, as the leaders of the German\r\nbands were feudal chiefs before the institution of feudalism.[58] He has\r\n\"rowed upon the sea, his naked sword hard in his hand, amidst the fierce\r\nwaves and coldest of storms, and the rage of winter hurtled over the\r\nwaves of the deep.\" The sea-monsters, \"the many-colored foes, drew him\r\nto the bottom of the sea, and held him fast in their gripe.\" But he\r\nreached \"the wretches with his point and with his war-bill. The mighty\r\nsea-beast received the war-rush through his-hands,\" and he slew nine\r\nNicors (sea-monsters). And now behold him, as he comes across the waves\r\nto succor the old King Hrothgar, who with his vassals sits afflicted in\r\nhis great mead-hall, high and curved with pinnacles. For \"a grim\r\nstranger, Grendel, a mighty haunter of the marshes,\" had entered his\r\nhall during the night, seized thirty of the thanes who were asleep, and\r\nreturned in his war-craft with their carcasses; for twelve years the\r\ndreadful ogre, the beastly and greedy creature, father of Orks and\r\nJötuns, devoured men and emptied the best of houses. Beowulf, the great\r\nwarrior, offers to grapple with the fiend, and foe to foe contend for\r\nlife, without the bearing of either sword or ample shield, for he has\r\n\"learned also that the wretch for his cursed hide recketh not of\r\nweapons,\" asking only that if death takes him, they will bear forth his\r\nbloody corpse and bury it; mark his fen-dwelling, and send to Hygelác,\r\nhis chief, the best of war-shrouds that guards his breast.\r\n\r\nHe is lying in the hall, \"trusting in his proud strength; and when the\r\nmists of night arose, lo, Grendel comes, tears open the door,\" seized a\r\nsleeping warrior: \"he tore him unawares, he bit his body, he drank the\r\nblood from the veins, he swallowed him with continual tearings.\" But\r\nBeowulf seized him in turn, and \"raised himself upon his elbow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The lordly hall thundered, the ale was spilled,... both were enraged;\r\nsavage and strong warders; the house resounded; then was it a great\r\nwonder that the wine-hall withstood the beasts of war, that it fell not\r\nupon the earth, the fair palace; but it was thus fast.... The noise\r\narose, new enough; a fearful terror fell on the North Danes, on each of\r\nthose who from the wall heard the outcry, God's denier sing his dreadful\r\nlay, his song of defeat, lament his wound.[59]... The foul wretch\r\nawaited the mortal wound; a mighty gash was evident upon his shoulder;\r\nthe sinews sprung asunder, the junctures of the bones burst; success in\r\nwar was given to Beowulf. Thence must Grendel fly sick unto death, among\r\nthe refuges of the fens, to seek his joyless dwelling. He all the better\r\nknew that the end of his life, the number of his days was gone by.\"[60]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor he had left on the ground, \"hand, arm, and shoulder\"; and \"in the\r\nlake of Nicors, where he was driven, the rough wave was boiling with\r\nblood, the foul spring of waves all mingled, hot with poison; the dye,\r\ndiscolored with death, bubbled with warlike gore.\" There remained a\r\nfemale monster, his mother, who, like him, \"was doomed to inhabit the\r\nterror of waters, the cold streams,\" who came by night, and amidst drawn\r\nswords tore and devoured another man, Æschere, the king's best friend.\r\nA lamentation arose in the palace, and Beowulf offered himself again.\r\nThey went to the den, a hidden land, the refuge of the wolf, near the\r\nwindy promontories, where a mountain stream rusheth downwards under the\r\ndarkness of the hills, a flood beneath the earth; the wood fast by its\r\nroots overshadoweth the water; there may one by night behold a marvel,\r\nfire upon the flood; the stepper over the heath, when wearied out by the\r\nhounds, sooner will give up his soul, his life upon the brink, than\r\nplunge therein to hide his head. Strange dragons and serpents swam\r\nthere; \"from time to time the horn sang a dirge, a terrible song.\"\r\nBeowulf plunged into the wave, descended, passed monsters who tore his\r\ncoat of mail, to the ogress, the hateful manslayer, who, seizing him in\r\nher grasp, bore him off to her dwelling. A pale gleam shone brightly,\r\nand there, face to face, the good champion perceived\r\n\r\n\r\n\"the she-wolf of the abyss, the mighty sea-woman; he gave the war-onset\r\nwith his battle-bill; he held not back the swing of the sword, so that\r\non her head the ring-mail sang aloud a greedy war-song.... The beam of\r\nwar would not bite. Then caught the prince of the War-Geáts Grendel's\r\nmother by the shoulders... twisted the homicide, so that she bent upon\r\nthe floor... She drew her knife broad, brown-edged (and tried to\r\npierce), the twisted breast-net which protected his life.... Then saw he\r\namong the weapons a bill fortunate in victory, an old gigantic sword,\r\ndoughty of edge, ready for use, the work of giants. He seized the belted\r\nhilt; the warrior of the Scyldings, fierce and savage whirled the\r\nring-mail; despairing of life, he struck furiously, so that it grappled\r\nhard with her about the neck; it broke the bone-rings, the bill passed\r\nthrough all the doomed body; she sank upon the floor; the sword was\r\nbloody, the man rejoiced in his deed; the beam shone, light stood\r\nwithin, even as from heaven mildly shines the lamp of the\r\nfirmament.\"[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he saw Grendel dead in a corner of the hall; and four of his\r\ncompanions, having with difficulty raised the monstrous head, bore it by\r\nthe hair to the palace of the king.\r\n\r\nThat was his first labor; and the rest of his life was similar. When he\r\nhad reigned fifty years on earth, a dragon, who had been robbed of his\r\ntreasure, came from the hill and burned men and houses \"with waves of\r\nfire. Then did the refuge of earls command to make for him a\r\nvariegated shield, all of iron; he knew well enough that a shield of\r\nwood could not help him, lindenwood opposed to fire.... The prince of\r\nrings was then too proud to seek the wide flier with a troop, with a\r\nlarge company; he feared not for himself that battle, nor did he make\r\nany account of the dragon's war, his laboriousness and valor.\" And yet\r\nhe was sad, and went unwillingly, for he was \"fated to abide the end.\"\r\nThen \"he was ware of a cavern, a mound under the earth, nigh to the sea\r\nwave, the clashing of waters, which cave was full within of embossed\r\nornaments and wires. ... Then the king, hard in war, sat upon the\r\npromontory, whilst he, the prince of the Geáts, bade farewell to his\r\nhousehold comrades. ... I, the old guardian of my people, seek a feud.\"\r\nHe \"let words proceed from his breast,\" the dragon came, vomiting fire;\r\nthe blade bit not his body, and the king \"suffered painfully, involved\r\nin fire.\" His comrades had \"turned to the wood, to save their lives,\"\r\nall save Wiglaf, who \"went through the fatal smoke,\" knowing well \"that\r\nit was not the old custom\" to abandon relation and prince, \"that he\r\nalone... shall suffer distress, shall sink in battle. The worm came\r\nfurious, the foul insidious stranger, variegated with waves of fire,...\r\nhot and warlike fierce, he clutched the whole neck with bitter banes; he\r\nwas bloodied with life-gore, the blood boiled in waves.\"[62] They, with\r\ntheir swords, carved the worm in the midst. Yet the wound of the king\r\nbecame burning and swelled; \"he soon discovered that poison boiled in\r\nhis breast within, and sat by the wall upon a stone\"; \"he looked upon\r\nthe work of giants, how the eternal cavern held within stone arches fast\r\nupon pillars.\" Then he said--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have held this people fifty years; there was not any king of my\r\nneighbors, who dared to greet me with warriors, to oppress me with\r\nterror.... I held mine own well, I sought not treacherous malice, nor\r\nswore unjustly many oaths; on account of all this, I, sick with mortal\r\nwounds, may have joy.... Now do thou go immediately to behold the hoard\r\nunder the hoary stone, my dear Wiglaf.... Now, I have purchased with my\r\ndeath a hoard of treasures; it will be yet of advantage at the need of\r\nthe people.... I give thanks... that I might before my dying day obtain\r\nsuch for my peoples... longer may I not here be.\"[63]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is thorough and real generosity, not exaggerated and pretended, as\r\nit will be later on in the romantic imaginations of babbling clerics,\r\nmere composers of adventure. Fiction as yet is not far removed from\r\nfact; the man breathes manifest beneath the hero. Rude as the poetry is,\r\nits hero is grand; he is so, simply by his deeds. Faithful, first to his\r\nprince, then to his people, he went alone, in a strange land, to venture\r\nhimself for the delivery of his fellow-men; he forgets himself in death,\r\nwhile thinking only that it profits others. \"Each one of us,\" he says in\r\none place, \"must abide the end of his present life.\" Let, therefore,\r\neach do justice, if he can, before his death. Compare with him the\r\nmonsters whom he destroys, the last traditions of the ancient wars\r\nagainst inferior races, and of the primitive religion; think of his life\r\nof danger, nights upon the waves, man grappling with the brute creation;\r\nman's indomitable will crushing the breasts of beasts; man's powerful\r\nmuscles which, when exerted, tear the flesh of the monsters; you will\r\nsee reappear through the mist of legends, and under the light of poetry,\r\nthe valiant men who, amid the madness of war and the raging of their own\r\nmood, began to settle a people and to found a state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--Pagan Poems\r\n\r\n\r\nOne poem nearly whole and two or three fragments are all that remain of\r\nthis lay-poetry of England. The rest of the pagan current, German and\r\nbarbarian, was arrested or overwhelmed, first by the influx of the\r\nChristian religion, then by the conquest of the Norman-French. But what\r\nremains more than suffices to show the strange and powerful poetic\r\ngenius of the race, and to exhibit beforehand the flower in the bud.\r\n\r\nIf there has ever been anywhere a deep and serious poetic sentiment, it\r\nis here. They do not speak, they sing, or rather they shout. Each little\r\nverse is an acclamation, which breaks forth like a growl; their strong\r\nbreasts heave with a groan of anger or enthusiasm, and a vehement or\r\nindistinct phrase or expression rises suddenly, almost in spite of them,\r\nto their lips. There is no art, no natural talent, for describing singly\r\nand in order the different parts of an object or an event. The fifty\r\nrays of light which every phenomenon emits in succession to a regular\r\nand well-directed intellect, come to them at once in a glowing and\r\nconfused mass, disabling them by their force and convergence. Listen to\r\ntheir genuine war-chants, unchecked and violent, as became their\r\nterrible voices. To this day, at this distance of time, separated as\r\nthey are by manners, speech, ten centuries, we seem to hear them still:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The army goes forth: the birds sing, the cricket chirps, the\r\nwar-weapons sound, the lance clangs against the shield. Now shineth the\r\nmoon, wandering under the sky. Now arise deeds of woe, which the enmity\r\nof this people prepares to do.... Then in the court came the tumult of\r\nwar-carnage. They seized with their hands the hollow wood of the shield.\r\nThey smote through the bones of the head. The roofs of the castle\r\nresounded, until Garulf fell in battle, the first of earth-dwelling men,\r\nson of Guthlaf. Around him lay many brave men dying. The raven whirled\r\nabout, dark and sombre, like a willow leaf. There was a sparkling of\r\nblades, as if all Finsburg were on fire. Never have I heard of a more\r\nworthy battle in war.\"[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the song on Athelstan's victory at Brunanburh:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Here Athelstan king, of earls the lord, the giver of the bracelets of\r\nthe nobles, and his brother also, Edmund the ætheling, the Elder a\r\nlasting glory won by slaughter in battle, with the edges of swords, at\r\nBrunanburh. The wall of shields they cleaved, they hewed the noble\r\nbanners: with the rest of the family, the children of Edward....\r\nPursuing, they destroyed the Scottish people and the ship-fleet.... The\r\nfield was colored with the warriors' blood! After that the sun on\r\nhigh,... the greatest star! glided over the earth, God's candle bright!\r\ntill the noble creature hastened to her setting. There lay soldiers many\r\nwith darts struck down, Northern men over their shields shot. So were\r\nthe Scots; weary of ruddy battle.... The screamers of war they left\r\nbehind; the raven to enjoy, the dismal kite, and the black raven with\r\nhorned beak, and the hoarse toad; the eagle, afterwards to feast on the\r\nwhite flesh; the greedy battle-hawk, and the grey beast, the wolf in the\r\nwood.\"[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere all is imagery. In their impassioned minds events are not bald,\r\nwith the dry propriety of an exact description; each fits in with its\r\npomp of sound, shape, coloring; it is almost a vision which is raised,\r\ncomplete, with its accompanying emotions, joy, fury, excitement. In\r\ntheir speech, arrows are \"the serpents of Hel, shot from bows of horn\";\r\nships are \"great sea-steeds,\" the sea is \"a chalice of waves,\" the\r\nhelmet is \"the castle of the head\"; they need an extraordinary speech to\r\nexpress their vehement sensations, so that after a time, in Iceland,\r\nwhere this kind of poetry was carried on to excess, the earlier\r\ninspiration failed, art replaced nature, the Skalds were reduced to a\r\ndistorted and obscure jargon. But whatever be the imagery, here, as in\r\nIceland, though unique, it is too feeble. The poets have not satisfied\r\ntheir inner emotion, if it is only expressed by a single word. Time\r\nafter time they return to and repeat their idea. \"The sun on high, the\r\ngreat star, God's brilliant candle, the noble creature!\" Four times\r\nsuccessively they employ the same thought, and each time under a new\r\naspect. All its different aspects rise simultaneously before the\r\nbarbarian's eyes, and each word was like a fit of the semi-hallucination\r\nwhich possessed him. Verily, in such a condition, the regularity of\r\nspeech and of ideas is disturbed at every turn. The succession of\r\nthought in the visionary is not the same as in a reasoning mind. One\r\ncolor induces another; from sound he passes to sound; his imagination is\r\nlike a diorama of unexplained pictures. His phrases recur and change; he\r\nemits the word that comes to his lips without hesitation; he leaps over\r\nwide intervals from idea to idea. The more his mind is transported, the\r\nquicker and wider the intervals traversed. With one spring he visits the\r\npoles of his horizon, and touches in one moment objects which seemed to\r\nhave the world between them. His ideas are entangled without order;\r\nwithout notice, abruptly, the poet will return to the idea he has\r\nquitted, and insert it in the thought to which he is giving expression.\r\nIt is impossible to translate these incongruous ideas, which quite\r\ndisconcert our modern style. At times they are unintelligible.[66]\r\nArticles, particles, everything capable of illuminating thought, of\r\nmarking the connection of terms, of producing regularity of ideas, all\r\nrational and logical artifices, are neglected.[67] Passion bellows forth\r\nlike a great shapeless beast; and that is all. It rises and starts in\r\nlittle abrupt lines; it is the acme of barbarism. Homer's happy poetry\r\nis copiously developed, in full narrative, with rich and extended\r\nimagery. All the details of a complete picture are not too much for him;\r\nhe loves to look at things, he lingers over them, rejoices in their\r\nbeauty, dresses them in splendid words; he is like the Greek girls, who\r\nthought themselves ugly if they did not bedeck arms and shoulders with\r\nall the gold coins from their purse, and all the treasures from their\r\ncaskets; his long verses flow by with their cadences, and spread out\r\nlike a purple robe under an Ionian sun. Here the clumsy-fingered poet\r\ncrowds and clashes his ideas in a narrow measure; if measure there be,\r\nhe barely observes it; all his ornament is three words beginning with\r\nthe same letter. His chief care is to abridge, to imprison thought in a\r\nkind of mutilated cry.[68] The force of the internal impression, which,\r\nnot knowing how to unfold itself, becomes condensed and doubled by\r\naccumulation; the harshness of the outward expression, which,\r\nsubservient to the energy and shocks of the inner sentiment, seek only\r\nto exhibit it intact and original, in spite of and at the expense of all\r\norder and beauty—such are the characteristics of their poetry, and\r\nthese also will be the characteristics of the poetry which is to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--Christian Poems\r\n\r\n\r\nA race so constituted was predisposed to Christianity, by its gloom, its\r\naversion to sensual and reckless living, its inclination for the serious\r\nand sublime. When their sedentary habits had reconciled their souls to a\r\nlong period of ease, and weakened the fury which fed their sanguinary\r\nreligion, they readily inclined to a new faith. The vague adoration of\r\nthe great powers of nature, which eternally fight for mutual\r\ndestruction, and, when destroyed, rise up again to the combat, had long\r\nsince disappeared in the dim distance. Society, on its formation,\r\nintroduced the idea of peace and the need for justice, and the war-gods\r\nfaded from the minds of men, with the passions which had created them. A\r\ncentury and a half after the invasion by the Saxons,[69] Roman\r\nmissionaries, bearing a silver cross with a picture of Christ, came in\r\nprocession chanting a litany. Presently the high priest of the\r\nNorthumbrians declared in presence of the nobles that the old gods were\r\npowerless, and confessed that formerly \"he knew nothing of that which he\r\nadored\"; and he among the first, lance in hand, assisted to demolish\r\ntheir temple. Then a chief rose in the assembly, and said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You remember, it may be, O king, that which sometimes happens in winter\r\nwhen you are seated at table with your earls and thanes. Your fire is\r\nlighted, and your hall warmed, and without is rain and snow and storm.\r\nThen comes a swallow flying across the hall; he enters by one door, and\r\nleaves by another. The brief moment while he is within is pleasant to\r\nhim; he feels not rain nor cheerless winter weather; but the moment is\r\nbrief--the bird flies away in the twinkling of an eye, and he passes\r\nfrom winter to winter. Such, methinks, is the life of man on earth,\r\ncompared with the uncertain time beyond. It appears for a while; but\r\nwhat is the time which comes after—the time which was before? We know\r\nnot. If, then, this new doctrine may teach us somewhat of greater\r\ncertainty, it were well that we should regard it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis restlessness, this feeling of the infinite and dark beyond, this\r\nsober, melancholy eloquence, were the harbingers of spiritual life.[70]\r\nWe find nothing like it amongst the nations of the south, naturally\r\npagan, and preoccupied with the present life. These utter barbarians\r\nembrace Christianity straightway, through sheer force of mood and clime.\r\nTo no purpose are they brutal, heavy, shackled by infantine\r\nsuperstitions, capable, like King Canute, of buying for a hundred golden\r\ntalents the arm of Augustine. They possess the idea of God. This grand\r\nGod of the Bible, omnipotent and unique, who disappears almost entirely\r\nin the Middle Ages,[71] obscured by His court and His family, endures\r\namongst them in spite of absurd or grotesque legends. They do not blot\r\nHim out under pious romances, by the elevation of the saints, or under\r\nfeminine caresses, to benefit the infant Jesus and the Virgin. Their\r\ngrandeur and their severity raise them to His high level; they are not\r\ntempted, like artistic and talkative nations, to replace religion by a\r\nfair and agreeable narrative. More than any race in Europe, they\r\napproach, by the simplicity and energy of their conceptions, the old\r\nHebraic spirit. Enthusiasm is their natural condition; and their new\r\nDeity fills them with admiration, as their ancient deities inspired them\r\nwith fury. They have hymns, genuine odes, which are but a concrete of\r\nexclamations. They have no development; they are incapable of\r\nrestraining or explaining their passion; it bursts forth, in raptures,\r\nat the vision of the Almighty. The heart alone speaks here--a strong,\r\nbarbarous heart. Cædmon, their old poet,[72] says Bede, was a more\r\nignorant man than the others, who knew no poetry; so that in the hall,\r\nwhen they handed him the harp, he was obliged to withdraw, being unable\r\nto sing like his companions. Once, keeping night-watch over the stable,\r\nhe fell asleep. A stranger appeared to him, and asked him to sing\r\nsomething, and these words came into his head: \"Now we ought to praise\r\nthe Lord of heaven, the power of the Creator, and His skill, the deeds\r\nof the Father of glory; how he, being eternal God, is the author of all\r\nmarvels; who, almighty guardian of the human race, created first for the\r\nsons of men the heavens as the roof of their dwelling, and then the\r\nearth.\" Remembering this when he woke,[73] he came to the town, and they\r\nbrought him before the learned men, before the abbess Hilda, who, when\r\nthey had heard him, thought that he had received a gift from heaven, and\r\nmade him a monk in the abbey. There he spent his life listening to\r\nportions of Holy Writ, which were explained to him in Saxon, \"ruminating\r\nover them like a pure animal, turned them into most sweet verse.\" Thus\r\nis true poetry born. These men pray with all the emotion of a new soul;\r\nthey kneel; they adore; the less they know the more they think. Someone\r\nhas said that the first and most sincere hymn is this one word O! Theirs\r\nwere hardly longer; they only repeated time after time some deep\r\npassionate word, with monotonous vehemence. \"In heaven art Thou, our aid\r\nand succor, resplendent with happiness! All things bow before Thee,\r\nbefore the glory of Thy Spirit. With one voice they call upon Christ;\r\nthey all cry: Holy, holy art Thou, King of the angels of heaven, our\r\nLord! and Thy judgments are just and great; they reign forever and in\r\nall places, in the multitude of Thy works.\" We are reminded of the songs\r\nof the servants of Odin, tonsured now, and clad in the garments of\r\nmonks. Their poetry is the same; they think of God, as of Odin, in a\r\nstring of short, accumulated, passionate images, like a succession of\r\nlightning-flashes; the Christian hymns are a sequel to the pagan. One of\r\nthem, Adhelm, stood on a bridge leading to the town where he lived, and\r\nrepeated warlike and profane odes as well as religious poetry, in order\r\nto attract and instruct the men of his time. He could do it without\r\nchanging his key. In one of them, a funeral song, Death speaks. It was\r\none of the last Saxon compositions, containing a terrible Christianity,\r\nwhich seems at the same time to have sprung from the blackest depths of\r\nthe Edda. The brief metre sounds abruptly, with measured stroke, like\r\nthe passing bell. It is as if we hear the dull resounding responses\r\nwhich roll through the church, while the rain beats on the dim glass,\r\nand the broken clouds sail mournfully in the sky; and our eyes, glued to\r\nthe pale face of a dead man feel beforehand the horror of the damp grave\r\ninto which the living are about to cast him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For thee was a house built ere thou wert born; for thee was a mould\r\nshapen ere thou of thy mother earnest. Its height is not determined, nor\r\nits depth measured; nor is it closed up (however long it may be) until I\r\nthee bring where thou shalt remain; until I shall measure thee and the\r\nsod of the earth. Thy house is not highly built; it is unhigh and low.\r\nWhen thou art in it, the heel-ways are low, the sideways unhigh. The\r\nroof is built thy breast full high; so thou shalt in earth dwell full\r\ncold, dim, and dark. Doorless is that house, and dark it is within.\r\nThere thou art fast detained, and Death holds the key. Loathly is that\r\nearth-house, and grim to dwell in. There thou shalt dwell, and worms\r\nshall share thee. Thus thou art laid, and leavest thy friends. Thou hast\r\nno friend that will come to thee, who will ever inquire how that house\r\nliketh thee, who shall ever open for thee the door, and seek thee, for\r\nsoon thou becomest loathly and hateful to look upon.\"[74]\r\n\r\n\r\nHas Jeremy Taylor a more gloomy picture? The two religious poetries,\r\nChristian and pagan, are so like, that one might mingle their\r\nincongruities, images, and legends. In Beowulf, altogether pagan, the\r\nDeity appears as Odin, more mighty and serene, and differs from the\r\nother only as a peaceful Bretwalda[75] differs from an adventurous and\r\nheroic bandit-chief. The Scandinavian monsters, Jötuns, enemies of the\r\nÆsir,[76] have not vanished; but they descend from Cain, and the giants\r\ndrowned by the flood.[77] Their new hell is nearly the ancient\r\nNástrand,[78] \"a dwelling deadly cold, full of bloody eagles and pale\r\nadders\"; and the dreadful last day of judgment, when all will crumble\r\ninto dust, and make way for a purer world, resembles the final\r\ndestruction of Edda, that \"twilight of the gods,\" which will end in a\r\nvictorious regeneration, an everlasting joy \"under a fairer sun.\"\r\n\r\nBy this natural conformity they were able to make their religious poems\r\nindeed poems. Power in spiritual productions arises only from the\r\nsincerity of personal and original sentiment. If they can relate\r\nreligious tragedies, it is because their soul was tragic, and in a\r\ndegree biblical. They introduce into their verses, like the old prophets\r\nof Israel, their fierce vehemence, their murderous hatreds, their\r\nfanaticism, all the shudderings of their flesh and blood. One of them,\r\nwhose poem is mutilated, has related the history of Judith--with what\r\ninspiration we shall see. It needed a barbarian to display in such\r\nstrong light excesses, tumult, murder, vengeance, and combat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then was Holofernes exhilarated with wine; in the halls of his guests\r\nhe laughed and shouted, he roared and dinned. Then might the children of\r\nmen afar off hear how the stern one stormed and clamored, animated and\r\nelated with wine. He admonished amply that they should bear it well to\r\nthose sitting on the bench. So was the wicked one over all the day, the\r\nlord and his men, drunk with wine, the stern dispenser of wealth; till\r\nthat they swimming lay over drunk, all his nobility, as they were\r\ndeath-slain.\"[79]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night having arrived, he commands them to bring into his tent \"the\r\nillustrious virgin\"; then, going to visit her, he falls drunk on his\r\nbed. The moment was come for \"the maid of the Creator, the holy woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She took the heathen man fast by his hair; she drew him by his limbs\r\ntowards her disgracefully; and the mischiefful odious man at her\r\npleasure laid; so as the wretch she might the easiest well command. She\r\nwith the twisted locks struck the hateful enemy, meditating hate, with\r\nthe red sword, till she had half cut off his neck; so that he lay in a\r\nswoon, drunk and mortally wounded. He was not then dead, not entirely\r\nlifeless. She struck then earnest, the woman illustrious in strength,\r\nanother time the heathen hound, till that his head rolled forth upon the\r\nfloor. The foul one lay without a coffer; backward his spirit turned\r\nunder the abyss, and there was plunged below, with sulphur fastened;\r\nforever afterward wounded by worms. Bound in torments, hard imprisoned,\r\nin hell he burns. After his course he need not hope, with darkness\r\noverwhelmed, that he may escape from that mansion of worms; but there he\r\nshall remain; ever and ever, without end, henceforth in that\r\ncavern-house, void of the joys of hope.\"[80]\r\n\r\n\r\nHad anyone ever heard a sterner accent of satisfied hate? When Clovis\r\nlistened to the Passion play, he cried, \"Why was I not there with my\r\nFranks!\" So here the old warrior instinct swelled into flame over the\r\nHebrew wars. As soon as Judith returned,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Men under helms (went out) from the holy city at the dawn itself. They\r\ndinned shields; men roared loudly. At this rejoiced the lank wolf in the\r\nwood, and the wan raven, the fowl greedy of slaughter, both from the\r\nwest, that the sons of men for them should have thought to prepare their\r\nfill on corpses. And to them flew in their paths the active devourer,\r\nthe eagle, hoary in his feathers. The willowed kite, with his horned\r\nbeak, sang the song of Hilda. The noble warriors proceeded, they in\r\nmail, to the battle, furnished with shields, with swelling banners. ...\r\nThey then speedily let fly forth showers of arrows, the serpents of\r\nHilda, from their horn bows; the spears on the ground hard stormed. Loud\r\nraged the plunderers of battle; they sent their darts into the throng of\r\nthe chiefs.... They that awhile before the reproach of the foreigners,\r\nthe taunts of the heathen endured.\"[81]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst all these unknown poets[82] there is one whose name we know,\r\nCædmon, perhaps the old Cædmon who wrote the first hymn; like him, at\r\nall events, who, paraphrasing the Bible with a barbarian's vigor and\r\nsublimity, has shown the grandeur and fury of the sentiment with which\r\nthe men of these times entered into their new religion. He also sings\r\nwhen he speaks; when he mentions the ark, it is with a profusion of\r\npoetic names, \"the floating house, the greatest of floating chambers,\r\nthe wooden fortress, the moving roof, the cavern, the great sea-chest,\"\r\nand many more. Every time he thinks of it, he sees it with his mind,\r\nlike a quick luminous vision, and each time under a new aspect, now\r\nundulating on the muddy waves, between two ridges of foam, now casting\r\nover the water its enormous shadow, black and high like a castle, \"now\r\nenclosing in its cavernous sides\" the endless swarm of caged beasts.\r\nLike the others, he wrestles with God in his heart; triumphs like a\r\nwarrior over destruction and victory; and in relating the death of\r\nPharaoh, can hardly speak from anger, or see, because the blood mounts\r\nto his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The folk was affrighted, the flood-dread seized on their sad souls;\r\nocean wailed with death, the mountain heights were with blood\r\nbe-steamed, the sea foamed gore, crying was in the waves, the water full\r\nof weapons, a death-mist rose; the Egyptians were turned back; trembling\r\nthey fled, they felt fear: would that host gladly find their homes;\r\ntheir vaunt grew sadder: against them, as a cloud, rose the fell rolling\r\nof the waves; there came not any of that host to home, but from behind\r\nenclosed them fate with the wave. Where ways ere lay sea raged. Their\r\nmight was merged, the streams stood, the storm rose high to heaven; the\r\nloudest army-cry the hostile uttered; the air above was thickened with\r\ndying voices.... Ocean raged, drew itself up on high, the storms rose,\r\nthe corpses rolled.\"[83]\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the song of the Exodus more abrupt, more vehement, or more savage?\r\nThese men can speak of the creation like the Bible, because they speak\r\nof destruction like the Bible. They have only to look into their own\r\nhearts in order to discover an emotion sufficiently strong to raise\r\ntheir souls to the height of their Creator. This emotion existed already\r\nin their pagan legends; and Cædmon, in order to recount the origin of\r\nthings, has only to turn to the ancient dreams, such as have been\r\npreserved in the prophecies of the Edda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There had not here as yet, save cavern-shade, aught been; but this wide\r\nabyss stood deep and dim, strange to its Lord, idle and useless; on\r\nwhich looked with his eyes the King firm of mind, and beheld these\r\nplaces void of joys; saw the dark cloud lower in eternal night, swart\r\nunder heaven, dark and waste, until this worldly creation through the\r\nword existed of the Glory-King.... The earth as yet was not green with\r\ngrass; ocean cover'd, swart in eternal night, far and wide the dusky\r\nways.\"[84]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this manner will Milton hereafter speak, the descendant of the Hebrew\r\nseers, last of the Scandinavian seers, but assisted in the development\r\nof his thought by all the resources of Latin culture and civilization.\r\nAnd yet he will add nothing to the primitive sentiment. Religious\r\ninstinct is not acquired; it belongs to the blood, and is inherited with\r\nit. So it is with other instincts; pride in the first place, indomitable\r\nself-conscious energy, which sets man in opposition to all domination,\r\nand inures him against all pain. Milton's Satan exists already in\r\nCædmon's, as the picture exists in the sketch; because both have their\r\nmodel in the race; and Caedmon found his originals in the northern\r\nwarriors, as Milton did in the Puritans:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why shall I for his favor serve, bend to him in such vassalage? I may\r\nbe a god as he. Stand by me, strong associates, who will not fail me in\r\nthe strife. Heroes stern of mood, they have chosen me for chief,\r\nrenowned warriors! with such may one devise counsel, with such capture\r\nhis adherents; they are my zealous friends, faithful in their thoughts;\r\nI may be their chieftain, sway in this realm; thus to me it seemeth not\r\nright that I in aught need cringe to God for any good; I will no longer\r\nbe his vassal.\"[85]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is overcome: shall he be subdued? He is cast into the place \"where\r\ntorment they suffer, burning heat intense, in midst of hell, fire, and\r\nbroad flames; so also the bitter seeks smoke and darkness\"; will he\r\nrepent? At first he is astonished, he despairs; but it is a hero's\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This narrow place is most unlike that other that we ere knew,[86] high\r\nin heaven's kingdom, which my master bestow'd on me.... Oh, had I power\r\nof my hands, and might one season be without, be one winter's space,\r\nthen with this host I--But around me lie iron bonds, presseth this cord\r\nof chain: I am powerless! me have so hard the clasps of hell, so firmly\r\ngrasped! Here is a vast fire above and underneath, never did I see a\r\nloathlier landskip; the flame abateth not, hot over hell. Me hath the\r\nclasping of these rings, this hard-polish'd band, impeded in my course,\r\ndebarr'd me from my way; my feet are bound, my hands manacled,... so\r\nthat with aught I cannot from these limb-bonds escape.\"[87]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing to be done against God, it is His new creature, man,\r\nwhom he must attack. To him who has lost everything, vengeance is left;\r\nand if the conquered can enjoy this, he will find himself happy; \"he\r\nwill sleep softly, even under his chains.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--Primitive Saxon Authors\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the foreign culture ceased. Beyond Christianity it could not graft\r\nupon this barbarous stock any fruitful or living branch. All the\r\ncircumstances which elsewhere mellowed the wild sap, failed here. The\r\nSaxons found Britain abandoned by the Romans; they had not yielded, like\r\ntheir brothers on the Continent, to the ascendancy of a superior\r\ncivilization; they had not become mingled with the inhabitants of the\r\nland; they had always treated them like enemies or slaves, pursuing like\r\nwolves those who escaped to the mountains of the west, treating like\r\nbeasts of burden those whom they had conquered with the land. While the\r\nGermans of Gaul, Italy, and Spain became Romans, the Saxons retained\r\ntheir language, their genius and manners, and created in Britain a\r\nGermany outside of Germany. A hundred and fifty years after the Saxon\r\ninvasion, the introduction of Christianity and the dawn of security\r\nattained by a society inclining to peace, gave birth to a kind of\r\nliterature; and we meet with the venerable Bede, and later on, Alcuin,\r\nJohn Scotus Erigena, and some others, commentators, translators,\r\nteachers of barbarians, who tried not to originate but to compile, to\r\npick out and explain from the great Greek and Latin encyclopædia\r\nsomething which might suit the men of their time. But the wars with the\r\nDanes came and crushed this humble plant, which, if left to itself,\r\nwould have come to nothing.[88] When Alfred[89] the Deliverer became\r\nking, \"there were very few ecclesiastics,\" he says, \"on this side of the\r\nHumber, who could understand in English their own Latin prayers, or\r\ntranslate any Latin writing into English. On the other side of the\r\nHumber I think there were scarce any; there were so few that, in truth,\r\nI cannot remember a single man south of the Thames, when I took the\r\nkingdom, who was capable of it.\" He tried, like Charlemagne, to instruct\r\nhis people, and turned into Saxon for their use several works, above all\r\nsome moral books, as the \"de Consolatione\" of Boethius; but this very\r\ntranslation bears witness to the barbarism of his audience. He adapts\r\nthe text in order to bring it down to their intelligence; the pretty\r\nverses of Boethius, somewhat pretentious, labored, elegant, crowded with\r\nclassical allusions of a refined and compact style worthy of Seneca,\r\nbecome an artless, long-drawn-out and yet desultory prose, like a\r\nnurse's fairy tale, explaining everything, recommencing and breaking off\r\nits phrases, making ten turns about a single detail; so low was it\r\nnecessary to stoop to the level of this new intelligence, which had\r\nnever thought or known anything. Here follows the Latin of Boethius, so\r\naffected, so pretty, with the English translation affixed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Quondam funera conjugis\r\nVates Threicius gemens,\r\nPostquam flebilibus modis\r\nSilvas currere, mobiles\r\nAmnes stare coegerat,\r\nJunxitque intrepidum latus\r\nSævis cerva leonibus,\r\nNec visum timuit lepus\r\nJam cantu placidum canem;\r\nCum flagrantior intima\r\nFervor pectoris ureret,\r\nNec qui cuncta subegerant\r\nMulcerent dominum modi;\r\nImmites superos querens,\r\nInfernas adiit domos.\r\nIllic blanda sonantibus\r\nChordis carmina temperans,\r\nQuidquid praecipuis Deæ\r\nMatris fontibus hauserat,\r\nQuod luctus dabat impotens,\r\nQuod luctum geminans amor,\r\nDeflet Tartara commovens,\r\nEt dulci veniam prece\r\nUmbrarum dominos rogat.\r\nStupet tergeminus novo\r\nCaptus carmine janitor;\r\nQuæ sontes agitant metu\r\nUltrices scelerum Deæ\r\nJam mœstæ lacrymis madent.\r\nNon Ixionium caput\r\nVelox præcipitat rota,\r\nEt longa site perditus\r\nSpernit flumina Tantalus.\r\nVultur dum satur est modis\r\nNon traxit Tityi jecur.\r\nTandem, vincimur, arbiter\r\nUmbrarum miserans ait.\r\nDonemus comitem viro,\r\nEmptam carmine conjugem.\r\nSed lex dona coerceat,\r\nNec, dum Tartara liquerit,\r\nFas sit lumina flectere.\r\nQuis legem det amantibus!\r\nMajor lex fit amor sibi.\r\nHeu! noctis prope terminos\r\nOrpheus Eurydicem suam\r\nVidit, perdidit, occidit.\r\nVos hæc fabula respicit,\r\nQuicunque in superum diem\r\nMentem ducere quæritis.\r\nNam qui tartareum in specus\r\nVictus lumina flexerit,\r\nQuidquid præcipuum trahit\r\nPerdit, dum videt inferos.\"\r\n\r\n--_Book III. Metre 12._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English translation follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It happened formerly that there was a harper in the country called\r\nThrace, which was in Greece. The harper was inconceivably good. His name\r\nwas Orpheus. He had a very excellent wife, called Eurydice. Then began\r\nmen to say concerning the harper, that he could harp so that the wood\r\nmoved, and the stones stirred themselves at the sound, and wild beasts\r\nwould run thereto, and stand as if they were tame; so still, that though\r\nmen or hounds pursued them, they shunned them not. Then said they, that\r\nthe harper's wife should die, and her soul should be led to hell. Then\r\nshould the harper become so sorrowful that he could not remain among the\r\nmen, but frequented the wood, and sat on the mountains, both day and\r\nnight, weeping and harping, so that the woods shook, and the rivers\r\nstood still, and no hart shunned any lion, nor hare any hound; nor did\r\ncattle know any hatred, or any fear of others, for the pleasure of the\r\nsound. Then it seemed to the harper that nothing in this world pleased\r\nhim. Then thought he that he would seek the gods of hell, and endeavor\r\nto allure them with his harp, and pray that they would give him back his\r\nwife. When he came thither, then should there come towards him the dog\r\nof hell, whose name was Cerberus--he should have three heads—and began\r\nto wag his tail, and play with him for his harping. Then was there also\r\na very horrible gatekeeper, whose name should be Charon. He had also\r\nthree heads, and he was very old. Then began the harper to beseech him\r\nthat he would protect him while he was there, and bring him thence again\r\nsafe. Then did he promise that to him, because he was desirous of the\r\nunaccustomed sound. Then went he further until he met the fierce\r\ngoddesses, whom the common people call Parcæ, of whom they say, that\r\nthey know no respect for any man, but punish every man according to his\r\ndeeds; and of whom they say, that they control every man's fortune. Then\r\nbegan he to implore their mercy. Then began they to weep with him. Then\r\nwent he farther, and all the inhabitants of hell ran towards him, and\r\nled him to their king: and all began to speak with him, and to pray that\r\nwhich he prayed. And the restless wheel which Ixion, the king of the\r\nLapithæ, was bound to for his guilt, that stood still for his harping.\r\nAnd Tantalus the king, who in this world was immoderately greedy, and\r\nwhom that same vice of greediness followed there, he became quiet. And\r\nthe vulture should cease, so that he tore not the liver of Tityus the\r\nking, which before therewith tormented him. And all the punishments of\r\nthe inhabitants of hell were suspended, whilst he harped before the\r\nking. When he long and long had harped, then spoke the king of the\r\ninhabitants of hell, and said, Let us give the man his wife, for he has\r\nearned her by his harping. He then commanded him that he should well\r\nobserve that he never looked backwards after he departed hence; and\r\nsaid, if he looked backwards, that he should lose the woman. But men can\r\nwith great difficulty, if at all, restrain love! Wellaway! What! Orpheus\r\nthen led his wife with him till he came to the boundary of light and\r\ndarkness. Then went his wife after him. When he came forth into the\r\nlight, then looked be behind his back towards the woman. Then was she\r\nimmediately lost to him. This fable teaches every man who desires to fly\r\nthe darkness of hell, and to come to the light of the true good, that he\r\nlook not about him to his old vices, so that he practise them again as\r\nfully as he did before. For whosoever with full will turns his mind to\r\nthe vices which he had before forsaken, and practises them, and they\r\nthen fully please him, and he never thinks of forsaking them; then loses\r\nhe all his former good unless he again amend it.\"[90]\r\n\r\n\r\nA man speaks thus when he wishes to impress upon the mind of his hearers\r\nan idea which is not clear to them. Boethius had for his audience\r\nsenators, men of culture, who understood as well as we the slightest\r\nmythological allusion. Alfred is obliged to take them up and develop\r\nthem, like a father or a master, who draws his little boy between his\r\nknees, and relates to him names, qualities, crimes and their\r\npunishments, which the Latin only hints at. But the ignorance is such\r\nthat the teacher himself needs correction. He takes the Parcæ for the\r\nErinyes, and gives Charon three heads like Cerberus. There is no\r\nadornment in his version; no delicacy as in the original. Alfred has\r\nhard work to make himself understood. What, for instance, becomes of the\r\nnoble Platonic moral, the apt interpretation after the style of\r\nIamblichus and Porphyry? It is altogether dulled. He has to call\r\neverything by its name, and turn the eyes of his people to tangible and\r\nvisible things. It is a sermon suited to his audience of thanes; the\r\nDanes whom he had converted by the sword needed a clear moral. If he had\r\ntranslated for them exactly the last words of Boethius, they would have\r\nopened wide their big stupid eyes and fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nFor the whole talent of an uncultivated mind lies in the force and\r\noneness of its sensations. Beyond that it is powerless. The art of\r\nthinking and reasoning lies above it. These men lost all genius when\r\nthey lost their fever-heat. They lisped awkwardly and heavily dry\r\nchronicles, a sort of historical almanacs. You might think them\r\npeasants, who, returning from their toil, came and scribbled with chalk\r\non a smoky table the date of a year of scarcity, the price of corn, the\r\nchanges in the weather, a death. Even so, side by side with the meagre\r\nBible chronicles, which set down the successions of kings, and of Jewish\r\nmassacres, are exhibited the exaltation of the psalms and the transports\r\nof prophecy. The same lyric poet can be alternately a brute and a\r\ngenius, because his genius comes and goes like a disease, and instead of\r\nhaving it he simply is ruled by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AD. 611. This year Cynegils succeeded to the government in Wessex, and\r\nheld it one-and-thirty winters. Cynegils was the son of Ceol, Ceol of\r\nCutha, Cutha of Cynric.\r\n\r\n\"614. This year Cynegils and Cnichelm fought at Bampton, and slew two\r\nthousand and forty-six of the Welsh.\r\n\r\n\"678. This year appeared the comet-star in August, and shone every\r\nmorning during three months like a sunbeam. Bishop Wilfrid being driven\r\nfrom his bishopric by King Everth, two bishops were consecrated in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n\"901. This year died Alfred, the son of Ethelwulf, six nights before the\r\nmass of All Saints. He was king over all the English nation, except that\r\npart that was under the power of the Danes. He held the government one\r\nyear and a half less than thirty winters; and then Edward his son took\r\nto the government.\r\n\r\n\"902. This year there was the great fight at the Holme, between the men\r\nof Kent and the Danes.\r\n\r\n\"1077. This year were reconciled the King of the Franks, and William,\r\nKing of England. But it was continued only a little while. This year was\r\nLondon burned, one night before the Assumption of St. Mary, so terribly\r\nas it never was before since it was built.\"[91]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is thus the poor monks speak, with monotonous dryness, who, after\r\nAlfred's time, gather up and take note of great visible events; sparsely\r\nscattered we find a few moral reflections, a passionate emotion, nothing\r\nmore. In the tenth century we see King Edgar give a manor to a bishop,\r\non condition that he will put into Saxon the monastic regulation written\r\nin Latin by Saint Benedict. Alfred himself was almost the last man of\r\nculture; he, like Charlemagne, became so only by dint of determination\r\nand patience. In vain the great spirits of this age endeavor to link\r\nthemselves to the relics of the fine, ancient civilization, and to raise\r\nthemselves above the chaotic and muddy ignorance in which the others\r\nflounder. They rise almost alone, and on their death the rest sink again\r\ninto the mire. It is the human beast that remains master; the mind\r\ncannot find a place amidst the outbursts and the desires of the flesh,\r\ngluttony and brute force. Even in the little circle where he moves, his\r\nlabor comes to nought. The model which he proposed to himself oppresses\r\nand enchains him in a cramping imitation; he aspires but to be a good\r\ncopyist; he produces a gathering of centos which he calls Latin verses;\r\nhe applies himself to the discovery of expressions, sanctioned by good\r\nmodels; he succeeds only in elaborating an emphatic, spoiled Latin,\r\nbristling with incongruities. In place of ideas, the most profound\r\namongst them serve up the defunct doctrines of defunct authors. They\r\ncompile religious manuals and philosophical manuals from the Fathers.\r\nErigena, the most learned, goes to the extent of reproducing the old\r\ncomplicated dreams of Alexandrian metaphysics. How far these\r\nspeculations and reminiscences soar above the barbarous crowd which\r\nhowls and bustles in the depths below, no words can express. There was a\r\ncertain king of Kent in the seventh century who could not write. Imagine\r\nbachelors of theology discussing before an audience of wagoners, not\r\nParisian wagoners, but such as survive in Auvergne or in the Vosges.\r\nAmong these clerks, who think like studious scholars in accordance with\r\ntheir favorite authors, and are doubly separated from the world as\r\nscholars and monks, Alfred alone, by his position as a layman and a\r\npractical man, descends in his Saxon translations and his Saxon verses\r\nto the common level; and we have seen that his effort, like that of\r\nCharlemagne, was fruitless. There was an impassable wall between the old\r\nlearned literature and the present chaotic barbarism. Incapable, yet\r\ncompelled, to fit into the ancient mould, they gave it a twist. Unable\r\nto reproduce ideas, they reproduced a metre. They tried to eclipse their\r\nrivals in versification by the refinement of their composition, and the\r\nprestige of a difficulty overcome. So, in our own colleges, the good\r\nscholars imitate the clever divisions and symmetry of Claudian rather\r\nthan the ease and variety of Vergil. They put their feet in irons, and\r\nshowed their smartness by running in shackles; they weighted themselves\r\nwith rules of modern rhyme and rules of ancient metre; they added the\r\nnecessity of beginning each verse with the same letter that began the\r\nlast. A few, like Adhelm, wrote square acrostics, in which the first\r\nline, repeated at the end, was found also to the left and right of the\r\npiece. Thus made up of the first and last letters of each verse, it\r\nforms a border to the whole piece, and the morsel of verse is like a\r\npiece of tapestry. Strange literary tricks, which changed the poet into\r\nan artisan. They bear witness to the difficulties which then impeded\r\nculture and nature, and spoiled at once the Latin form and the Saxon\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nBeyond this barrier, which drew an impassable line between civilization\r\nand barbarism, there was another, no less impassable, between the Latin\r\nand Saxon genius. The strong German imagination, in which glowing and\r\nobscure visions suddenly meet and abruptly overflow, was in contrast\r\nwith the reasoning spirit, in which ideas gather and are developed only\r\nin a regular order; so that if the barbarian, in his classical attempts,\r\nretained any part of his primitive instincts, he succeeded only in\r\nproducing a grotesque and frightful monster. One of them, this very\r\nAdhelm, a relative of King Ina, who sang on the town-bridge profane and\r\nsacred hymns alternately, too much imbued with Saxon poesy, simply to\r\nimitate the antique models, adorned his Latin prose and verse with all\r\nthe \"English magnificence.\"[92] You might compare him to a barbarian who\r\nseizes a flute from the skilled hands of a player of Augustus's court,\r\nin order to blow on it with inflated lungs, as if it were the bellowing\r\nhorn of an aurochs. The sober speech of the Roman orators and senators\r\nbecomes in his hands full of exaggerated and incoherent images; he\r\nviolently connects words, uniting them in a sudden and extravagant\r\nmanner; he heaps up his colors, and utters extraordinary and\r\nunintelligible nonsense, like that of the later Skalds; in short, he is\r\na latinized Skald, dragging into his new tongue the ornaments of\r\nScandinavian poetry, such as alliteration, by dint of which he\r\ncongregates in one of his epistles fifteen consecutive words, all\r\nbeginning with the same letter; and in order to make up his fifteen, he\r\nintroduces a barbarous Græcism amongst the Latin words.[93] Amongst the\r\nothers, the writers of legends, you will meet many times with\r\ndeformation of Latin, distorted by the outburst of a too vivid\r\nimagination; it breaks out even in their scholastic and scientific\r\nwriting. Here is part of a dialogue between Alcuin and prince Pepin, a\r\nson of Charlemagne, and he uses like formulas the little poetic and bold\r\nphrases which abound in the national poetry. \"What is winter? the\r\nbanishment of summer. What is spring? the painter of the earth. What is\r\nthe year? the world's chariot. What is the sun? the splendor of the\r\nworld, the beauty of heaven, the grace of nature, the honor of day, the\r\ndistributor of the hours. What is the sea? the path of audacity, the\r\nboundary of the earth, the receptacle of the rivers, the fountain of\r\nshowers.\" More, he ends his instructions with enigmas, in the spirit of\r\nthe Skalds, such as we still find in the old manuscripts with the\r\nbarbarian songs. It was the last feature of the national genius, which,\r\nwhen it labors to understand a matter, neglects dry, clear, consecutive\r\ndeduction, to employ grotesque, remote, oft-repeated imagery, and\r\nreplaces analysis by intuition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.--Virility of the Saxon Race\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was this race, the last born of the sister races, which, in the\r\ndecay of the other two, the Latin and the Greek, brings to the world a\r\nnew civilization, with a new character and genius. Inferior to these in\r\nmany respects, it surpasses them in not a few. Amidst the woods and mire\r\nand snows, under a sad, inclement sky, gross instincts have gained the\r\nday during this long barbarism. The German has not acquired gay humor,\r\nunreserved facility, the feeling for harmonious beauty; his great\r\nphlegmatic body continues savage and stiff, greedy and brutal; his rude\r\nand unpliable mind is still inclined to savagery, and restive under\r\nculture. Dull and congealed, his ideas cannot expand with facility and\r\nfreedom, with a natural sequence and an instinctive regularity. But this\r\nspirit, void of the sentiment of the beautiful, is all the more apt for\r\nthe sentiment of the true. The deep and incisive impression which he\r\nreceives from contact with objects, and which as yet he can only express\r\nby a cry, will afterwards liberate him from the Latin rhetoric, and will\r\nvent itself on things rather than on words. Moreover, under the\r\nconstraint of climate and solitude, by the habit of resistance and\r\neffort, his ideal is changed. Manly and moral instincts have gained the\r\nempire over him; and amongst them the need of independence, the\r\ndisposition for serious and strict manners, the inclination for devotion\r\nand veneration, the worship of heroism. Here are the foundations and the\r\nelements of a civilization, slower but sounder, less careful of what is\r\nagreeable and elegant, more based on justice and truth.[94] Hitherto at\r\nleast the race is intact, intact in its primitive coarseness; the Roman\r\ncultivation could neither develop nor deform it. If Christianity took\r\nroot, it was owing to natural affinities, but it produced no change in\r\nthe native genius. Now approaches a new conquest, which is to bring this\r\ntime men, as well as ideas. The Saxons, meanwhile, after the wont of\r\nGerman races, vigorous and fertile, have within the past six centuries\r\nmultiplied enormously. They were now about two millions, and the Norman\r\narmy numbered sixty thousand.[95] In vain these Normans become\r\ntransformed, gallicized; by their origin, and substantially in\r\nthemselves they are still the relatives of those whom they conquered. In\r\nvain they imported their manners and their poesy, and introduced into\r\nthe language a third part of its words; this language continues\r\naltogether German in element and in substance.[96] Though the grammar\r\nchanged, it changed integrally, by an internal action, in the same sense\r\nas its continental cognates. At the end of three hundred years the\r\nconquerors themselves were conquered; their speech became English; and\r\nowing to frequent intermarriage, the English blood ended by gaining the\r\npredominance over the Norman blood in their veins. The race finally\r\nremains Saxon. If the old poetic genius disappears after the Conquest,\r\nit is as a river disappears, and flows for a while underground. In five\r\ncenturies it will emerge once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Malte-Brun, IV. 398. Not counting bays, gulfs, and canals,\r\nthe sixteenth part of the country is covered by water.

Brave men had at length made a stand against the\r\nNorsemen and the robbers. They had planted their feet in the soil, and\r\nthe moving chaos of the general subsidence had become fixed by the\r\neffort of their great hearts and of their arms. At the mouths of the\r\nrivers, in the defiles of the mountains, on the margin of the waste\r\nborders, at all perilous passes, they had built their forts, each for\r\nhimself, each on his own land, each with his faithful band; and they had\r\nlived like a scattered but watchful army, encamped and confederate in\r\ntheir castles, sword in hand in front of the enemy. Beneath this\r\ndiscipline a formidable people had been formed, fierce hearts in strong\r\nbodies,[97] intolerant of restraint, longing for violent deeds, born for\r\nconstant warfare because steeped in permanent warfare, heroes and\r\nrobbers, who, as an escape from their solitude, plunged into adventures,\r\nand went, that they might conquer a country or win Paradise, to Sicily,\r\nto Portugal, to Spain, to Palestine, to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--Normans and Saxons Contrasted\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 27, 1066, at the mouth of the Somme, there was a great\r\nsight to be seen; four hundred large sailing vessels, more than a\r\nthousand transports, and sixty thousand men, were on the point of\r\nembarking.[98] The sun shone splendidly after long rain; trumpets\r\nsounded, the cries of this armed multitude rose to heaven; as far as the\r\neye could see, on the shore, in the wide-spreading river, on the sea\r\nwhich opens out thence broad and shining, masts and sails extended like\r\na forest; the enormous fleet set out wafted by the south wind.[99] The\r\npeople which it carried were said to have come from Norway, and they\r\nmight have been taken for kinsmen of the Saxons, with whom they were to\r\nfight; but there were with them a multitude of adventurers, crowding\r\nfrom all quarters, far and near, from north and south, from Maine and\r\nAnjou, from Poitou and Brittany, from Ile-de-France and Flanders, from\r\nAquitaine and Burgundy;[100] and, in short, the expedition itself was\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that, having kept its name, it had changed its nature? and\r\nwhat series of renovations had made a Latin out of a German people? The\r\nreason is, that this people, when they came to Neustria, were neither a\r\nnational body, nor a pure race. They were but a band; and as such,\r\nmarrying the women of the country, they introduced foreign blood into\r\ntheir children. They were a Scandinavian band, but swelled by all the\r\nbold knaves and all the wretched desperadoes who wandered about the\r\nconquered country;[101] and as such they received foreign blood into\r\ntheir veins. Moreover, if the nomadic band was mixed, the settled band\r\nwas much more so; and peace by its transfusions, like war by its\r\nrecruits, had changed the character of the primitive blood. When Rollo,\r\nhaving divided the land amongst his followers, hung the thieves and\r\ntheir abettors, people from every country gathered to him. Security,\r\ngood stern justice, were so rare, that they were enough to repeople a\r\nland.[102] He invited strangers, say the old writers, \"and made one\r\npeople out of so many folk of different natures.\" This assemblage of\r\nbarbarians, refugees, robbers, immigrants, spoke Romance or French so\r\nquickly, that the second Duke, wishing to have his son taught Danish,\r\nhad to send him to Bayeux, where it was still spoken. The great masses\r\nalways form the race in the end, and generally the genius and language.\r\nThus this people, so transformed, quickly became polished; the composite\r\nrace showed itself of a ready genius, far more wary than the Saxons\r\nacross the Channel, closely resembling their neighbors of Picardy,\r\nChampagne, and Ile-de-France. \"The Saxons,\" says an old writer,[103]\r\n\"vied with each other in their drinking feats, and wasted their income\r\nby day and night in feasting, whilst they lived in wretched hovels; the\r\nFrench and Normans, on the other hand, living inexpensively in their\r\nfine, large houses, were besides refined in their food and studiously\r\ncareful in their dress.\" The former, still weighted by the German\r\nphlegm, were gluttons and drunkards, now and then aroused by poetical\r\nenthusiasm; the latter, made sprightlier by their transplantation and\r\ntheir alloy, felt the cravings of the mind already making themselves\r\nmanifest. \"You might see amongst them churches in every village, and\r\nmonasteries in the cities, towering on high, and built in a style\r\nunknown before,\" first in Normandy, and later in England.[104] Taste had\r\ncome to them at once--that is, the desire to please the eye, and to\r\nexpress a thought by outward representation, which was quite a new idea:\r\nthe circular arch was raised on one or on a cluster of columns; elegant\r\nmouldings were placed about the windows; the rose window made its\r\nappearance, simple, yet, like the flower which gives it its name \"_rose\r\ndes buissons_\"; and the Norman style unfolded itself, original yet\r\nproportioned between the Gothic, whose richness it foreshadowed, and the\r\nRomance, whose solidity it recalled.\r\n\r\nWith taste, just as natural and just as quickly, was developed the\r\nspirit of inquiry. Nations are like children; with some the tongue is\r\nreadily loosened, and they comprehend at once; with others it is\r\nloosened with difficulty, and they are slow of comprehension. The men we\r\nare here speaking of had educated themselves nimbly, as Frenchmen do.\r\nThey were the first in France who unravelled the language, regulating it\r\nand writing it so well, that to this day we understand their codes and\r\ntheir poems. In a century and a half they were so far cultivated as to\r\nfind the Saxons \"unlettered and rude.\"[105] That was the excuse they\r\nmade for banishing them from the abbeys and all valuable ecclesiastical\r\noffices. And, in fact, this excuse was rational, for they instinctively\r\nhated gross stupidity. Between the Conquest and the death of King John,\r\nthey established five hundred and fifty-seven schools in England. Henry\r\nBeauclerk, son of the Conqueror, was trained in the sciences; so were\r\nHenry II and his three sons; Richard, the eldest of these, was a poet.\r\nLanfranc, first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, a subtle logician, ably\r\nargued the Real Presence; Anselm, his successor, the first thinker of\r\nthe age, thought he had discovered a new proof of the existence of God,\r\nand tried to make religion philosophical by adopting as his maxim,\r\n\"_Crede ut intelligas._\" The notion was doubtless grand, especially in\r\nthe eleventh century; and they could not have gone more promptly to\r\nwork. Of course the science I speak of was but scholastic, and these\r\nterrible folios slay more understandings than they confirm. But people\r\nmust begin as they can; and syllogism, even in Latin, even in theology,\r\nis yet an exercise of the mind and a proof of the understanding. Among\r\nthe continental priests who settled in England, one established a\r\nlibrary; another, founder of a school, made the scholars perform the\r\nplay of Saint Catherine; a third wrote in polished Latin, \"epigrams as\r\npointed as those of Martial.\" Such were the recreations of an\r\nintelligent race, eager for ideas, of ready and flexible genius, whose\r\nclear thought was not clouded, like that of the Saxon brain, by drunken\r\nhallucinations and the vapors of a greedy and well-filled stomach. They\r\nloved conversations, tales of adventure. Side by side with their Latin\r\nchroniclers, Henry of Huntingdon, William of Malmesbury, thoughtful men\r\nalready, who could not only relate, but criticise here and there, there\r\nwere rhyming chronicles in the vulgar tongue, as those of Geoffroy\r\nGaimar, Bénoît de Sainte-Maure, Robert Wace. Do not imagine that their\r\nverse-writers were sterile of words or lacking in details. They were\r\ntalkers, tale-tellers, speakers above all, ready of tongue, and never\r\nstinted in speech. Not singers by any means; they speak--this is their\r\nstrong point, in their poems as in their chronicles. They were the\r\nearliest who wrote the \"Song of Roland\"; upon this they accumulated a\r\nmultitude of songs concerning Charlemagne and his peers, concerning\r\nArthur and Merlin, the Greeks and Romans, King Horn, Guy of Warwick,\r\nevery prince and every people. Their minstrels (_trouvères_), like\r\ntheir knights, draw in abundance from Welsh, Franks, and Latins, and\r\ndescend upon East and West in the wide field of adventure. They address\r\nthemselves to a spirit of inquiry, as the Saxons to enthusiasm, and\r\ndilute in their long, clear, and flowing narratives the lively colors of\r\nGerman and Breton traditions; battles, surprises, single combats,\r\nembassies, speeches, processions, ceremonies, huntings, a variety of\r\namusing events, employ their ready and wandering imaginations. At first,\r\nin the \"Song of Roland,\" it is still kept in check; it walks with long\r\nstrides, but only walks. Presently its wings have grown; incidents are\r\nmultiplied; giants and monsters abound, the natural disappears, the song\r\nof the jongleur grows a poem under the hands of the _trouvère_; he\r\nwould speak, like Nestor of old, five, even six years running, and not\r\ngrow tired or stop. Forty thousand verses are not too much to satisfy\r\ntheir gabble; a facile mind, copious, inquisitive, descriptive, such is\r\nthe genius of the race. The Gauls, their fathers, used to delay\r\ntravellers on the road to make them tell their stories, and boasted,\r\nlike these, \"of fighting well and talking with ease.\"\r\n\r\nWith chivalric poetry, they are not wanting in chivalry; principally, it\r\nmay be, because they are strong, and a strong man loves to prove his\r\nstrength by knocking down his neighbors; but also from a desire of fame,\r\nand as a point of honor. By this one word honor the whole spirit of\r\nwarfare is changed. Saxon poets painted war as a murderous fury, as a\r\nblind madness which shook flesh and blood, and awakened the instincts of\r\nthe beast of prey; Norman poets describe it as a tourney. The new\r\npassion which they introduce is that of vanity and gallantry; Guy of\r\nWarwick dismounts all the knights in Europe, in order to deserve the\r\nhand of the prude and scornful Félice. The tourney itself is but a\r\nceremony, somewhat brutal I admit, since it turns upon the breaking of\r\narms and limbs, but yet brilliant and French. To show skill and courage,\r\ndisplay the magnificence of dress and armor, be applauded by and please\r\nthe ladies--such feelings indicate men of greater sociality, more under\r\nthe influence of public opinion, less the slaves of their own passions,\r\nvoid both of lyric inspiration and savage enthusiasm, gifted by a\r\ndifferent genius, because inclined to other pleasures.\r\n\r\nSuch were the men who at this moment were disembarking in England to\r\nintroduce their new manners and a new spirit, French at bottom, in mind\r\nand speech, though with special and provincial features; of all the most\r\nmatter-of-fact, with an eye to the main chance, calculating, having the\r\nnerve and the dash of our own soldiers, but with the tricks and\r\nprecautions of lawyers; heroic undertakers of profitable enterprises;\r\nhaving gone to Sicily and Naples, and ready to travel to Constantinople\r\nor Antioch, so it be to take a country or bring back money; subtle\r\npoliticians, accustomed in Sicily to hire themselves to the highest\r\nbidder, and capable of doing a stroke of business in the heat of the\r\nCrusade, like Bohémond, who, before Antioch, speculated on the dearth\r\nof his Christian allies, and would only open the town to them under\r\ncondition of their keeping it for himself; methodical and persevering\r\nconquerors, expert in administration, and fond of scribbling on paper,\r\nlike this very William, who was able to organize such an expedition, and\r\nsuch an army, and kept a written roll of the same, and who proceeded to\r\nregister the whole of England in his Domesday Book. Sixteen days after\r\nthe disembarkation, the contrast between the two nations was manifested\r\nat Hastings by its visible effects.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons \"ate and drank the whole night. You might have seen them\r\nstruggling much, and leaping and singing,\" with shouts of laughter and\r\nnoisy joy.[106] In the morning they packed behind their palisades the\r\ndense masses of their heavy infantry, and with battle-axe hung round\r\ntheir neck awaited the attack. The wary Normans weighed the chances of\r\nheaven and hell, and tried to enlist God upon their side. Robert Wace,\r\ntheir historian and compatriot, is no more troubled by poetical\r\nimagination than they were by warlike inspiration; and on the eve of the\r\nbattle his mind is as prosaic and clear as theirs.[107] The same spirit\r\nshowed itself in the battle. They were for the most part bowmen and\r\nhorsemen, well skilled, nimble, and clever. Taillefer, the _jongleur_,\r\nwho asked for the honor of striking the first blow, went singing, like a\r\ntrue French volunteer, performing tricks all the while.[108] Having\r\narrived before the English, he cast his lance three times in the air,\r\nthen his sword, and caught them again by the handle; and Harold's clumsy\r\nfoot-soldiers, who only knew how to cleave coats of mail by blows from\r\ntheir battle-axes, \"were astonished, saying to one another that it was\r\nmagic.\" As for William, amongst a score of prudent and cunning actions,\r\nhe performed two well-calculated ones, which, in this sore\r\nembarrassment, brought him safe out of his difficulties. He ordered his\r\narchers to shoot into the air; the arrows wounded many of the Saxons in\r\nthe face and one of them pierced Harold in the eye. After this he\r\nsimulated flight; the Saxons, intoxicated with joy and wrath, quitted\r\ntheir entrenchments, and exposed themselves to the lances of his\r\nhorsemen. During the remainder of the contest they only make a stand by\r\nsmall companies, fight with fury, and end by being slaughtered. The\r\nstrong, mettlesome, brutal race threw themselves on the enemy like a\r\nsavage bull; the dexterous Norman hunters wounded them adroitly, knocked\r\nthem down, and placed them under the yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--French Forms of Thought\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat then is this French race, which by arms and letters make such a\r\nsplendid entrance upon the world, and is so manifestly destined to rule,\r\nthat in the East, for example, their name of Franks will be given to all\r\nthe nations of the West? Wherein consists this new spirit, this\r\nprecocious pioneer, this key of all Middle-Age civilization? There is in\r\nevery mind of the kind a fundamental activity which, when incessantly\r\nrepeated, moulds its plan, and gives it its direction; in town or\r\ncountry, cultivated or not, in its infancy and its age, it spends its\r\nexistence and employs its energy in conceiving an event or an object.\r\nThis is its original and perpetual process; and whether it change its\r\nregion, return, advance, prolong, or alter its course, its whole motion\r\nis but a series of consecutive steps; so that the least alteration in\r\nthe size, quickness, or precision of its primitive stride transforms and\r\nregulates the whole course, as in a tree the structure of the first\r\nshoot determines the whole foliage, and governs the whole growth.[109]\r\nWhen the Frenchman conceives an event or an object, he conceives quickly\r\nand distinctly; there is no internal disturbance, no previous\r\nfermentation of confused and violent ideas, which, becoming concentrated\r\nand elaborated, end in a noisy outbreak. The movement of his\r\nintelligence is nimble and prompt, like that of his limbs; at once and\r\nwithout effort he seizes upon his idea. But he seizes that alone; he\r\nleaves on one side all the long entangling off-shoots whereby it is\r\nentwined and twisted amongst its neighboring ideas; he does not\r\nembarrass himself with nor think of them; he detaches, plucks, touches\r\nbut slightly, and that is all. He is deprived, or if you prefer it, he\r\nis exempt from those sudden half-visions which disturb a man, and open\r\nup to him instantaneously vast deeps and far perspectives. Images are\r\nexcited by internal commotion; he, not being so moved, imagines not. He\r\nis only moved superficially; he is without large sympathy; he does not\r\nperceive an object as it is, complex and combined, but in parts, with a\r\ndiscursive and superficial knowledge. That is why no race in Europe is\r\nless poetical. Let us look at their epics; none are more prosaic. They\r\nare not wanting in number: \"The Song of Roland, Garin le Loherain,\"\r\n\"Ogier le Danois,\"[110] \"Berthe aux grands Pieds.\" There is a library of\r\nthem. Though their manners are heroic and their spirit fresh, though\r\nthey have originality, and deal with grand events, yet, spite of this,\r\nthe narrative is as dull as that of the babbling Norman chroniclers.\r\nDoubtless when Homer relates he is as clear as they are, and he develops\r\nas they do: but his magnificent titles of rosy-fingered Morn, the\r\nwide-bosomed Air, the divine and nourishing Earth, the earth-shaking\r\nOcean, come in every instant and expand their purple bloom over the\r\nspeeches and battles, and the grand abounding similes which interrupt\r\nthe narrative tell of a people more inclined to enjoy beauty than to\r\nproceed straight to fact. But here we have facts, always facts, nothing\r\nbut facts; the Frenchman wants to know if the hero will kill the\r\ntraitor, the lover wed the maiden; he must not be delayed by poetry or\r\npainting. He advances nimbly to the end of the story, not lingering for\r\ndreams of the heart or wealth of landscape. There is no splendor, no\r\ncolor, in his narrative; his style is quite bare, and without figures;\r\nyou may read ten thousand verses in these old poems without meeting one.\r\nShall we open the most ancient, the most original, the most eloquent, at\r\nthe most moving point, the \"Song of Roland,\" when Roland is dying? The\r\nnarrator is moved, and yet his language remains the same, smooth,\r\naccentless, so penetrated by the prosaic spirit, and so void of the\r\npoetic! He gives an abstract of motives, a summary of events, a series\r\nof causes for grief, a series of causes for consolation.[111] Nothing\r\nmore. These men regard the circumstance or the action by itself, and\r\nadhere to this view. Their idea remains exact, clear, and simple, and\r\ndoes not raise up a similar image to be confused with the first, to\r\ncolor or transform itself. It remains dry; they conceive the divisions\r\nof the object one by one, without ever collecting them, as the Saxons\r\nwould, in an abrupt, impassioned, glowing semi-vision. Nothing is more\r\nopposed to their genius than the genuine songs and profound hymns, such\r\nas the English monks were singing beneath the low vaults of their\r\nchurches. They would be disconcerted by the unevenness and obscurity of\r\nsuch language. They are not capable of such an access of enthusiasm and\r\nsuch excess of emotion. They never cry out, they speak, or rather they\r\nconverse, and that at moments when the soul, overwhelmed by its trouble,\r\nmight be expected to cease thinking and feeling. Thus Amis, in a\r\nmystery-play, being leprous, calmly requires his friend Amille to slay\r\nhis two sons, in order that their blood may heal him of his leprosy; and\r\nAmille replies still more calmly.[112] If ever they try to sing, even in\r\nheaven, \"a roundelay high and clear,\" they will produce little rhymed\r\narguments, as dull as the dullest talk.[113] Pursue this literature to\r\nits conclusion; regard it, like that of the Skalds, at the time of its\r\ndecadence, when its vices, being exaggerated, display, like those of the\r\nSkalds, only still more strongly the kind of mind which produced it. The\r\nSkalds fall off into nonsense; it loses itself into babble and\r\nplatitude. The Saxon could not master his craving for exaltation; the\r\nFrenchman could not restrain the volubility of his tongue. He is too\r\ndiffuse and too clear; the Saxon is too obscure and brief. The one was\r\nexcessively agitated and carried away; the other explains and develops\r\nwithout measure. From the twelfth century the Gestes spun out degenerate\r\ninto rhapsodies and psalmodies of thirty or forty thousand verses.\r\nTheology enters into them; poetry becomes an interminable, intolerable\r\nlitany, where the ideas, expounded, developed, and repeated _ad\r\ninfinitum_, without one outburst of emotion or one touch of originality,\r\nflow like a clear and insipid stream, and send off their reader, by dint\r\nof their monotonous rhymes, into a comfortable slumber. What a\r\ndeplorable abundance of distinct and facile ideas! We meet with it again\r\nin the seventeenth century, in the literary gossip which took place at\r\nthe feet of men of distinction; it is the fault and the talent of the\r\nrace. With this involuntary art of perceiving, and isolating\r\ninstantaneously and clearly each part of every object, people can speak,\r\neven for speaking's sake, and forever.\r\n\r\nSuch is the primitive process; how will it be continued? Here appears a\r\nnew trait in the French genius, the most valuable of all. It is\r\nnecessary to comprehension that the second idea shall be contiguous to\r\nthe first; otherwise that genius is thrown out of its course and\r\narrested; it cannot proceed by irregular bounds; it must walk step by\r\nstep, on a straight road; order is innate in it; without study, and in\r\nthe first place, it disjoints and decomposes the object or event,\r\nhowever complicated and entangled it may be, and sets the parts one by\r\none in succession to each other, according to their natural connection.\r\nTrue, it is still in a state of barbarism; yet its intelligence is a\r\nreasoning faculty, which spreads, though unwittingly. Nothing is more\r\nclear than the style of the old French narratives and of the earliest\r\npoems: we do not perceive that we are following a narrator, so easy is\r\nthe gait, so even the road he opens to us, so smoothly and gradually\r\nevery idea glides into the next; and this is why he narrates so well.\r\nThe chroniclers Villehardouin, Joinville, Froissart, the fathers of\r\nprose, have an ease and clearness approached by none, and beyond all, a\r\ncharm, a grace, which they had not to go out of their way to find. Grace\r\nis a national possession in France, and springs from the native delicacy\r\nwhich has a horror of incongruities; the instinct of Frenchmen avoids\r\nviolent shocks in works of taste as well as in works of argument; they\r\ndesire that their sentiments and ideas shall harmonize, and not clash.\r\nThroughout they have this measured spirit, exquisitely refined.[114]\r\nThey take care, on a sad subject, not to push emotion to its limits;\r\nthey avoid big words. Think how Joinville relates in six lines the death\r\nof the poor sick priest who wished to finish celebrating the mass, and\r\n\"nevermore did sing, and died.\" Open a mystery-play, \"Théophilus,\" or\r\nthat of the \"Queen of Hungary,\" for instance: when they are going to\r\nburn her and her child, she says two short lines about \"this gentle dew\r\nwhich is so pure an innocent,\" nothing more. Take a fabliau, even a\r\ndramatic one: when the penitent knight, who has undertaken to fill a\r\nbarrel with his tears, dies in the hermit's company, he asks from him\r\nonly one last gift: \"Do but embrace me, and then I'll die in the arms of\r\nmy friend.\" Could a more touching sentiment be expressed in more sober\r\nlanguage? We must say of their poetry what is said of certain pictures:\r\nThis is made out of nothing. Is there in the world anything more\r\ndelicately graceful than the verses of Guillaume de Lorris? Allegory\r\nclothes his ideas so as to dim their too great brightness; ideal,\r\nfigures, half transparent, float about the lover, luminous, yet in a\r\ncloud, and lead him amidst all the delicate and gentle-hued ideas to the\r\nrose, whose \"sweet odor embalms all the plain.\" This refinement goes so\r\nfar, that in Thibaut of Champagne and in Charles of Orleans it turns to\r\naffectation and insipidity. In them all impressions grow more slender;\r\nthe perfume is so weak that one often fails to catch it; on their knees\r\nbefore their lady they whisper their waggeries and conceits; they love\r\npolitely and wittily, they arrange ingeniously in a bouquet their\r\n\"painted words,\" all the flowers of \"fresh and beautiful language\"; they\r\nknow how to mark fleeting ideas in their flight, soft melancholy, vague\r\nreverie; they are as elegant as talkative, and as charming as the most\r\namiable abbés of the eighteenth century. This lightness of touch is\r\nproper to the race, and appears as plainly under the armor and amid the\r\nmassacres of the Middle Ages as mid the courtesies and the musk-scented,\r\nwadded coats of the last court. You will find it in their coloring as in\r\ntheir sentiments. They are not struck by the magnificence of nature,\r\nthey see only her pretty side; they paint the beauty of a woman by a\r\nsingle feature, which is only polite, saying, \"She is more gracious than\r\nthe rose in May.\" They do not experience the terrible emotion, ecstasy,\r\nsudden oppression of heart which is displayed in the poetry of\r\nneighboring nations; they say discreetly, \"She began to smile, which\r\nvastly became her.\" They add, when they are in a descriptive humor,\r\n\"that she had a sweet and perfumed breath,\" and a body \"white as\r\nnew-fallen snow on a branch.\" They do not aspire higher; beauty pleases,\r\nbut does not transport them. They enjoy agreeable emotions, but are not\r\nfitted for deep sensations. The full rejuvenescence of being, the warm\r\nair of spring which renews and penetrates all existence, suggests but a\r\npleasing couplet; they remark in passing, \"Now is winter gone, the\r\nhawthorn blossoms, the rose expands,\" and so pass on about their\r\nbusiness. It is a light gladsomeness, soon gone, like that which an\r\nApril landscape affords. For an instant the author glances at the mist\r\nof the streams rising about the willow trees, that pleasant vapor which\r\nimprisons the brightness of the morning; then, humming a burden of a\r\nsong, he returns to his narrative. He seeks amusement, and herein lies\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nIn life, as in literature, it is pleasure he aims at, not sensual\r\npleasure or emotion. He is lively, not voluptuous; dainty, not a\r\nglutton. He takes love for a pastime, not for an intoxication. It is a\r\npretty fruit which he plucks, tastes, and leaves. And we must remark yet\r\nfurther, that the best of the fruit in his eyes is the fact of its being\r\nforbidden. He says to himself that he is duping a husband, that \"he\r\ndeceives a cruel woman, and thinks he ought to obtain a pope's\r\nindulgence for the deed.\"[115] He wishes to be merry--it is the state he\r\nprefers, the end and aim of his life; and especially to laugh at other\r\npeople. The short verse of his fabliaux gambols and leaps like a\r\nschoolboy released from school, over all things respected or\r\nrespectable; criticising the Church, women, the great, the monks.\r\nScoffers, banterers, our fathers have abundance both of expression and\r\nmatter; and the matter comes to them so naturally, that without culture,\r\nand surrounded by coarseness, they are as delicate in their raillery as\r\nthe most refined. They touch upon ridicule lightly, they mock without\r\nemphasis, as it were innocently; their style is so harmonious, that at\r\nfirst sight we make a mistake, and do not see any harm in it. They seem\r\nartless; they look so very demure; only a word shows the imperceptible\r\nsmile: it is the ass, for example, which they call the high priest, by\r\nreason of his padded cassock and his serious air, and who gravely begins\r\n\"to play the organ.\" At the close of the history, the delicate sense of\r\ncomicality has touched you, though you cannot say how. They do not call\r\nthings by their names, especially in love matters; they let you guess\r\nit; they assume that you are as sharp and knowing as themselves.[116] A\r\nman might discriminate, embellish at times, perhaps refine upon them,\r\nbut their first traits are incomparable. When the fox approaches the\r\nraven to steal the cheese, he begins as a hypocrite, piously and\r\ncautiously, and as one of the family. He calls the raven his \"good\r\nfather Don Rohart, who sings so well\"; he praises his voice, \"so sweet\r\nand fine. You would be the best singer in the world if you kept clear\r\nof nuts.\" Reynard is a rogue, an artist in the way of invention, not a\r\nmere glutton; he loves roguery for its own sake; he rejoices in his\r\nsuperiority, and draws out his mockery. When Tibert, the cat, by his\r\ncounsel hung himself at the bell-rope, wishing to ring it, he uses\r\nirony, enjoys and relishes it, pretends to wax impatient with the poor\r\nfool whom he has caught, calls him proud, complains because the other\r\ndoes not answer, and because he wishes to rise to the clouds-and visit\r\nthe saints. And from beginning to end this long epic of Reynard the Fox\r\nis the same; the raillery never ceases, and never fails to be agreeable.\r\nReynard has so much wit that he is pardoned for everything. The\r\nnecessity for laughter is national--so indigenous to the French, that a\r\nstranger cannot understand, and is shocked by it. This pleasure does not\r\nresemble physical joy in any respect, which is to be despised for its\r\ngrossness; on the contrary, it sharpens the intelligence, and brings to\r\nlight many a delicate or ticklish idea. The fabliaux are full of truths\r\nabout men, and still more about women, about people of low rank, and\r\nstill more about those of high rank; it is a method of philosophizing by\r\nstealth and boldly, in spite of conventionalism, and in opposition to\r\nthe powers that be. This taste has nothing in common either with open\r\nsatire, which is offensive because it is cruel; on the contrary, it\r\nprovokes good humor. We soon see that the jester is not ill-disposed,\r\nthat he does not wish to wound: if he stings, it is as a bee, without\r\nvenom; an instant later he is not thinking of it; if need be, he will\r\ntake himself as an object of his pleasantry; all he wishes is to keep up\r\nin himself and in us sparkling and pleasing ideas. Do we not see here in\r\nadvance an abstract of the whole French literature, the incapacity for\r\ngreat poetry, the sudden and durable perfection of prose, the excellence\r\nof all the moods of conversation and eloquence, the reign and tyranny of\r\ntaste and method, the art and theory of development and arrangement, the\r\ngift of being measured, clear, amusing, and piquant? We have taught\r\nEurope how ideas fall into order, and which ideas are agreeable; and\r\nthis is what our Frenchmen of the eleventh century are about to teach\r\ntheir Saxons during five or six centuries, first with the lance, next\r\nwith the stick, next with the birch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--The Normans in England\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider, then, this Frenchman or Norman, this man from Anjou or Maine,\r\nwho in his well-knit coat of mail, with sword and lance, came to seek\r\nhis fortune in England. He took the manor of some slain Saxon, and\r\nsettled himself in it with his soldiers and comrades, gave them land,\r\nhouses, the right of levying taxes, on condition of their fighting under\r\nhim and for him, as men-at-arms, marshals, standard-bearers; it was a\r\nleague in case of danger. In fact, they were in a hostile and conquered\r\ncountry, and they have to maintain themselves. Each one hastened to\r\nbuild for himself a place of refuge, castle or fortress,[117] well\r\nfortified, of solid stone, with narrow windows, strengthened with\r\nbattlements, garrisoned by soldiers, pierced with loopholes. Then these\r\nmen went to Salisbury, to the number of sixty thousand, all holders of\r\nland, having at least enough to maintain a man with horse or arms.\r\nThere, placing their hands in William's they promised him fealty and\r\nassistance; and the king's edict declared that they must be all united\r\nand bound together like brothers in arms, to defend and succor each\r\nother. They are an armed colony, stationary, like the Spartans amongst\r\nthe Helots; and they make laws accordingly. When a Frenchman is found\r\ndead in any district, the inhabitants are to give up the murderer, or\r\nfailing to do so, they must pay forty-seven marks as a fine; if the dead\r\nman is English, it rests with the people of the place to prove it by the\r\noath of four near relatives of the deceased. They are to beware of\r\nkilling a stag, boar, or fawn; for an offence against the forest-laws\r\nthey will lose their eyes. They have nothing of all their property\r\nassured to them except as alms, or on condition of paying tribute, or by\r\ntaking the oath of allegiance. Here a free Saxon proprietor is made a\r\nbody-slave on his own estate.[118] Here a noble and rich Saxon lady\r\nfeels on her shoulder the weight of the hand of a Norman valet, who is\r\nbecome by force her husband or her lover. There were Saxons of one sol,\r\nor of two sols, according to the sum which they gained for their\r\nmasters; they sold them, hired them, worked them on joint account, like\r\nan ox or an ass. One Norman abbot has his Saxon predecessors dug up,\r\ntheir bones thrown without the gates. Another keeps men-at-arms, who\r\nbring his recalcitrant monks to reason by blows of their swords.\r\nImagine, if you can, the pride of these new lords, conquerors,\r\nstrangers, masters, nourished by habits of violent activity, and by the\r\nsavagery, ignorance, and passions of feudal life. \"They thought they\r\nmight do whatsoever they pleased,\" say the old chroniclers. \"They shed\r\nblood indiscriminately, snatched the morsel of bread from the mouth of\r\nthe wretched, and seized upon all the money, the goods, the land.\"[119]\r\nThus \"all the folk in the low country were at great pains to seem humble\r\nbefore Ivo Taillebois, and only to address him with one knee on the\r\nground; but although they made a point of paying him every honor, and\r\ngiving him all and more than all which they owed him in the way of rent\r\nand service, he harassed, tormented, tortured, imprisoned them, set his\r\ndogs upon their cattle, ... broke the legs and backbones of their beasts\r\nof burden, ... and sent men to attack their servants on the road with\r\nsticks and swords.\"[120] The Normans would not and could not borrow any\r\nidea or custom from such boors;[121] they despised them as coarse and\r\nstupid. They stood amongst them, as the Spaniards amongst the Americans\r\nin the sixteenth century, superior in force and culture, more versed in\r\nletters, more expert in the arts of luxury. They preserved their manners\r\nand their speech. England, to all outward appearance--the court of the\r\nking, the castles of the nobles, the palaces of the bishops, the houses\r\nof the wealthy--was French; and the Scandinavian people, of whom sixty\r\nyears ago the Saxon kings used to have poems sung to them, thought that\r\nthe nation had forgotten its language, and treated it in their laws as\r\nthough it were no longer their sister.\r\n\r\nIt was a French literature, then, which was at this time domiciled\r\nacross the channel,[122] and the conquerors tried to make it purely\r\nFrench, purged from all Saxon alloy. They made such a point of this that\r\nthe nobles in the reign of Henry II sent their sons to France, to\r\npreserve them from barbarisms. \"For two hundred years,\" says\r\nHigden,[123] \"children in scole, agenst the usage and manir of all other\r\nnations beeth compelled for to leve hire own langage, and for to\r\nconstrue hir lessons and hire thynges in Frensche.\" The statutes of the\r\nuniversities obliged the students to converse either in French or Latin.\r\n\"Gentilmen children beeth taught to speke Frensche from the tyme that\r\nthey bith rokked in hire cradell; and uplondissche men will likne\r\nhimself to gentylmen, and fondeth with greet besynesse for to speke\r\nFrensche.\" Of course the poetry is French. The Norman brought his\r\nminstrel with him; there was Taillefer, the _jongleur_, who sang the\r\n\"Song of Roland\" at the battle of Hastings; there was Adeline, the\r\n_jongleuse_, received an estate in the partition which followed the\r\nConquest. The Norman who ridicules the Saxon kings, who dug up the Saxon\r\nsaints and cast them without the walls of the church, loved none but\r\nFrench ideas and verses. It was into French verse that Robert Wace\r\nrendered the legendary history of the England which was conquered, and\r\nthe actual history of the Normandy in which he continued to live. Enter\r\none of the abbeys where the minstrels come to sing, \"where the clerks\r\nafter dinner and supper read poems, the chronicles of kingdoms, the\r\nwonders of the world,\"[124] you will only find Latin or French verses,\r\nLatin or French prose. What becomes of English? Obscure, despised, we\r\nhear it no more, except in the mouths of degraded franklins, outlaws of\r\nthe forest, swineherds, peasants, the lowest orders. It is no longer, or\r\nscarcely written; gradually we find in the Saxon Chronicle that the\r\nidiom alters, is extinguished; the Chronicle itself ceases within a\r\ncentury after the Conquest.[125] The people who have leisure or security\r\nenough to read or write are French; for them authors devise and compose;\r\nliterature always adapts itself to the taste of those who can appreciate\r\nand pay for it. Even the English[126] endeavor to write in French: thus\r\nRobert Grostête, in his allegorical poem on Christ; Peter Langtoft, in\r\nhis \"Chronicle of England,\" and in his \"Life of Thomas à Becket\"; Hugh\r\nde Rotheland, in his poem of \"Hippomedon\"; John Hoveden, and many\r\nothers. Several write the first half of the verse in English, and the\r\nsecond in French; a strange sign of the ascendancy which is moulding and\r\noppressing them. Even in the fifteenth century[127] many of these poor\r\nfolk are employed in this task; French is the language of the court,\r\nfrom it arose all poetry and elegance; he is but a clodhopper who is\r\ninapt at that style. They apply themselves to it as our old scholars did\r\nto Latin verses; they are gallicized as those were latinized, by\r\nconstraint, with a sort of fear, knowing well that they are but\r\nschoolboys and provincials. Gower, one of their best poets, at the end\r\nof his French works, excuses himself humbly for not having \"_de\r\nFrançais la faconde. Pardonnez moi_,\" he says, \"_que de ce je forsvoie;\r\nje suis Anglais._\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, after all, neither the race nor the tongue has perished. It is\r\nnecessary that the Norman should learn English, in order to command his\r\ntenants; his Saxon wife speaks it to him, and his sons receive it from\r\nthe lips of their nurse; the contagion is strong, for he is obliged to\r\nsend them to France, to preserve them from the jargon which on his\r\ndomain threatens to overwhelm and spoil them. From generation to\r\ngeneration the contagion spreads; they breathe it in the air, with the\r\nforesters in the chase, the farmers in the field, the sailors on the\r\nships: for these coarse people, shut in by their animal existence, are\r\nnot the kind to learn a foreign language; by the simple weight of their\r\ndullness they impose their idiom on their conquerors, at all events such\r\nwords as pertain to living things. Scholarly speech, the language of\r\nlaw, abstract and philosophical expressions--in short, all words\r\ndepending on reflection and culture may be French, since there is\r\nnothing to prevent it. This is just what happens; these kind of ideas\r\nand this kind of speech are not understood by the commonalty, who, not\r\nbeing able to touch them, cannot change them. This produces a French, a\r\ncolonial French, doubtless perverted, pronounced with closed mouth, with\r\na contortion of the organs of speech, \"after the school of\r\nStratford-atte-Bow\"; yet it is still French. On the other hand, as\r\nregards the speech employed about common actions and visible objects, it\r\nis the people, the Saxons, who fix it; these living words are too firmly\r\nrooted in his experience to allow of being parted with, and thus the\r\nwhole substance of the language comes from him. Here, then, we have the\r\nNorman who, slowly and constrainedly, speaks and understands English, a\r\ndeformed, gallicized English, yet English, in sap and root; but he has\r\ntaken his time about it, for it has required two centuries. It was only\r\nunder Henry III that the new tongue is complete, with the new\r\nconstitution; and that, after the like fashion, by alliance and\r\nintermixture; the burgesses come to take their seats in Parliament with\r\nthe nobles, at the same time that Saxon words settle down in the\r\nlanguage side by side with French words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--The English Tongue--Early English Literary Impulses\r\n\r\n\r\nSo was modern English formed, by compromise, and the necessity of being\r\nunderstood. But we can well imagine that these nobles, even while\r\nspeaking the rising dialect, have their hearts full of French tastes and\r\nideas; France remains the home of their mind, and the literature which\r\nnow begins, is but translation. Translators, copyists, imitators--there\r\nis nothing else. England is a distant province, which is to France what\r\nthe United States were, thirty years ago, to Europe: she exports her\r\nwool, and imports her ideas. Open the \"Voyage and Travaile of Sir John\r\nMaundeville,\"[128] the oldest prose-writer, the Villehardouin of the\r\ncountry: his book is but the translation of a translation.[129] He\r\nwrites first in Latin, the language of scholars; then in French, the\r\nlanguage of society; finally he reflects, and discovers that the barons,\r\nhis compatriots, by governing the Saxon churls, have ceased to speak\r\ntheir own Norman, and that the rest of the nation never knew it; he\r\ntranslates his manuscript into English, and, in addition, takes care to\r\nmake it plain, feeling that he speaks to less expanded understandings.\r\nHe says in French: \"_Il advint une fois que Mahomet allait dans une\r\nchapelle où il y avait un saint ermite. Il entra en la chapelle où il y\r\navait une petite huisserie et basse, et était bien petite la chapelle;\r\net alors devint la porte si grande qu'il semblait que ce fut la porte\r\nd'un palais._\"\r\n\r\nHe stops, corrects himself, wishes to explain himself better for his\r\nreaders across the Channel, and says in English: \"And at the Desertes of\r\nArabye, he wente into a Chapelle where a Eremyte duelte. And whan he\r\nentred in to the Chapelle that was but a lytille and a low thing, and\r\nhad but a lytill Dore and a low, than the Entree began to wexe so gret\r\nand so large, and so highe, as though it had ben of a gret Mynstre, or\r\nthe Zate of a Paleys.\"[130] You perceive that he amplifies, and thinks\r\nhimself bound to clinch and drive in three or four times in succession\r\nthe same idea, in order to get it into an English brain; his thought is\r\ndrawn out, dulled, spoiled in the process. Like every copy, the new\r\nliterature is mediocre, and repeats what it imitates, with fewer merits\r\nand greater faults.\r\n\r\nLet us see, then, what our Norman baron gets translated for him; first,\r\nthe chronicles of Geoffroy Gaimar and Robert Wace, which consist of the\r\nfabulous history of England continued up to their day, a dull-rhymed\r\nrhapsody, turned into English in a rhapsody no less dull. The first\r\nEnglishman who attempts it is Layamon,[131] a monk of Ernely, still\r\nfettered in the old idiom, who sometimes happens to rhyme, sometimes\r\nfails, altogether barbarous and childish, unable to develop a continuous\r\nidea, babbling in little confused and incomplete phrases, after the\r\nfashion of the ancient Saxons; after him a monk, Robert of\r\nGloucester,[132] and a canon, Robert of Brunne, both as insipid and\r\nclear as their French models, having become gallicized, and adopted the\r\nsignificant characteristics of the race, namely, the faculty and habit\r\nof easy narration, of seeing moving spectacles without deep emotion, of\r\nwriting prosaic poetry, of discoursing and developing, of believing that\r\nphrases ending in the same sounds form real poetry. Our honest English\r\nversifiers, like their preceptors in Normandy and Ile-de-France,\r\ngarnished with rhymes their dissertations and histories, and called them\r\npoems. At this epoch, in fact, on the Continent, the whole learning of\r\nthe schools descends into the street; and Jean de Meung, in his poem of\r\n\"La Rose,\" is the most tedious of doctors. So in England, Robert of\r\nBrunne transposes into verse the \"Manuel des péchés\" of Bishop\r\nGrostête; Adam Davie,[133] certain Scripture histories; Hampole[134]\r\ncomposes the \"Pricke of Conscience.\" The titles alone make one yawn:\r\nwhat of the text?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mankynde mad ys do Goddus wylle,\r\nAnd alle Hys byddyngus to fulfille;\r\nFor of al Hys makyng more and les,\r\nMan most principal creature es.\r\nAl that He made for man hit was done,\r\nAs ye schal here after sone.\"[135]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a poem! You did not think so; call it a sermon, if you will\r\ngive it its proper name. It goes on, well divided, well prolonged,\r\nflowing, but void of meaning; the literature which surrounds and\r\nresembles it bears witness of its origin by its loquacity and its\r\nclearness.\r\n\r\nIt bears witness to it by other and more agreeable features. Here and\r\nthere we find divergences more or less awkward into the domain of\r\ngenius; for instance, a ballad full of quips against Richard, King of\r\nthe Romans, who was taken at the battle of Lewes. Sometimes, charm is\r\nnot lacking, nor sweetness either. No one has ever spoken so bright and\r\nso well to the ladies as the French of the Continent, and they have not\r\nquite forgotten this talent while settling in England. You perceive it\r\nreadily in the manner in which they celebrate the Virgin. Nothing could\r\nbe more different from the Saxon sentiment, which is altogether\r\nbiblical, than the chivalric adoration of the sovereign Lady, the\r\nfascinating Virgin and Saint, who was the real deity of the Middle Ages.\r\nIt breathes in this pleasing hymn:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Blessed beo thu, lavedi,\r\nFul of hovene blisse;\r\nSwete flur of parais,\r\nModer of milternisse....\r\nI-blessed beo thu, Lavedi,\r\nSo fair and so briht;\r\nAl min hope is uppon the,\r\nBi day and bi nicht....\r\nBricht and scene quen of storre,\r\nSo me liht and lere.\r\nIn this false fikele world,\r\nSo me led and steore.\"[136]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is but a short and easy step between this tender worship of the\r\nVirgin and the sentiments of the court of love. The English rhymesters\r\ntake it; and when they wish to praise their earthly mistresses, they\r\nborrow, here as elsewhere, the ideas and the very form of French verse.\r\nOne compares his lady to all kinds of precious stones and flowers;\r\nothers sing truly amorous songs, at times sensual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bytuene Mershe and Aueril,\r\nWhen spray biginneth to springe.\r\nThe lutel foul hath hire wyl\r\nOn hyre lud to synge,\r\nIch libbe in loue longinge\r\nFor semlokest of alle thynge.\r\nHe may me blysse bringe,\r\nIcham in hire baundoun.\r\nAn hendy hap ich abbe yhent,\r\nIchot from heuene it is me sent.\r\nFrom alle wymmen my love is lent,\r\nAnd lyht on Alisoun.\"[137]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother sings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Suete lemmon, y preye the, of loue one speche,\r\nWhil y lyue in world so wyde other nulle y seche.\r\nWith thy loue, my suete leof, mi bliss thou mihtes eche\r\nA suete cos of thy mouth mihte be my leche.\"[138]\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not this the lively and warm imagination of the south? they speak of\r\nspringtime and of love, \"the fine and lovely weather\" like _trouvères_,\r\neven like _troubadours._ The dirty, smoke-grimed cottage, the black\r\nfeudal castle, where all but the master lie higgledy-piggledy on the\r\nstraw in the great stone hall, the cold rain, the muddy earth, make the\r\nreturn of the sun and the warm air delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sumer is i-cumen in,\r\nLhude sing cuccu:\r\nGroweth sed, and bloweth med,\r\nAnd springeth the wde nu.\r\nSing cuccu, cuccu.\r\nAwe bleteth after lomb,\r\nLlouth after calue cu,\r\nBulluc sterteth, bucke verteth:\r\nMurie sing cuccu,\r\nCuccu, cuccu.\r\nWel singes thu cuccu;\r\nNe swik thu nauer nu.\r\nSing, cuccu nu,\r\nSing, cuccu.\"[139]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are glowing pictures, such as Guillaume de Lorris was writing at\r\nthe same time, even richer and more lifelike, perhaps because the poet\r\nfound here for inspiration that love of country life which in England is\r\ndeep and national. Others, more imitative, attempt pleasantries like\r\nthose of Rutebeuf and the fabliaux, frank quips,[140] and even\r\nsatirical, loose waggeries. Their true aim and end is to hit out at the\r\nmonks. In every French country or country which imitates France, the\r\nmost manifest use of convents is to furnish material for sprightly and\r\nscandalous stories. One writes, for instance, of the kind of life the\r\nmonks lead at the abbey of Cocagne:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is a wel fair abbei,\r\nOf white monkes and of grei.\r\nTher beth bowris and halles:\r\nAl of pasteiis beth the wallis,\r\nOf fleis, of fisse, and rich met,\r\nThe likfullist that man may et.\r\nFluren cakes beth the schingles alle.\r\nOf cherche, cloister, boure, and halle.\r\nThe pinnes beth fat podinges\r\nRich met to princes and kinges....\r\nThough paradis be miri and bright\r\nCokaign is of fairir sight,...\r\nAnother abbei is ther bi,\r\nForsoth a gret fair nunnerie....\r\nWhen the someris dai is hote\r\nThe young nunnes takith a bote...\r\nAnd doth ham forth in that river\r\nBoth with ores and with stere....\r\nAnd each monk him takith on,\r\nAnd snellich berrith forth har prei\r\nTo the mochil grei abbei,\r\nAnd techith the nunnes an oreisun,\r\nWith iamblene up and down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the triumph of gluttony and feeding. Moreover many things could\r\nbe mentioned in the Middle Ages which are now unmentionable. But it was\r\nthe poems of chivalry, which represented to him the bright side of his\r\nown mode of life, that the baron preferred to have translated. He\r\ndesired that his _trouvère_ should set before his eyes the magnificence\r\nwhich he displayed, and the luxury and enjoyments which he has\r\nintroduced from France. Life at that time, without and even during war,\r\nwas a great pageant, a brilliant and tumultuous kind of fête. When\r\nHenry II travelled, he took with him a great number of horsemen,\r\nfoot-soldiers, baggage-wagons, tents, pack-horses, comedians, courtesans\r\nand their overseers, cooks, confectioners, posture-makers, dancers,\r\nbarbers, go-betweens, hangers-on.[141] In the morning when they start,\r\nthe assemblage begins to shout, sing, hustle each other, make racket and\r\nrout, \"as if hell were let loose.\" William Longchamps, even in time of\r\npeace, would not travel without a thousand horses by way of escort. When\r\nArchbishop à Becket came to France, he entered the town with two\r\nhundred knights, a number of barons and nobles, and an army of servants,\r\nall richly armed and equipped, he himself being provided with\r\nfour-and-twenty suits; two hundred and fifty children walked in front,\r\nsinging national songs; then dogs, then carriages, then a dozen\r\npack-horses, each ridden by an ape and a man; then equerries with\r\nshields and war-horses; then more equerries, falconers, a suit of\r\ndomestics, knights, priests; lastly, the archbishop himself, with his\r\nprivate friends. Imagine these processions, and also these\r\nentertainments; for the Normans, after the Conquest, \"borrowed from the\r\nSaxons the habit of excess in eating and drinking.\"[142] At the marriage\r\nof Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall, they provided thirty thousand\r\ndishes.[143] They also continued to be gallant, and punctiliously\r\nperformed the great precept of the love courts; for in the Middle Ages\r\nthe sense of love was no more idle than the others. Moreover,\r\ntournaments were plentiful; a sort of opera prepared for their own\r\nentertainment. So ran their life, full of adventure and adornment, in\r\nthe open air and in the sunlight, with show of cavalcades and arms; they\r\nact a pageant, and act it with enjoyment. Thus the King of Scots, having\r\ncome to London with a hundred knights, at the coronation of Edward I,\r\nthey all dismounted, and made over their horses and superb caparisons to\r\nthe people; as did also five English lords, imitating their example. In\r\nthe midst of war they took their pleasure. Edward III, in one of his\r\nexpeditions against the King of France, took with him thirty falconers,\r\nand made his campaign alternately hunting and fighting.[144] Another\r\ntime, says Froissart, the knights who joined the army carried a plaster\r\nover one eye, having vowed not to remove it until they had performed an\r\nexploit worthy of their mistresses. Out of the very exuberancy of spirit\r\nthey practised the art of poetry; out of the buoyancy of their\r\nimagination they made a sport of life. Edward III built at Windsor a\r\nhall and a round table; and at one of his tourneys in London, sixty\r\nladies, seated on palfreys, led, as in a fairy tale, each her knight by\r\na golden chain. Was not this the triumph of the gallant and frivolous\r\nFrench fashions? Edward's wife Philippa sat as a model to the artists\r\nfor their Madonnas. She appeared on the field of battle; listened to\r\nFroissart, who provided her with moral-plays, love-stories, and \"things\r\nfair to listen to.\" At once goddess, heroine, and scholar, and all this\r\nso agreeably, was she not a true queen of refined chivalry? Now, as also\r\nin France under Louis of Orleans and the Dukes of Burgundy, this most\r\nelegant and romanesque civilization came into full bloom, void of common\r\nsense, given up to passion, bent on pleasure, immoral and brilliant,\r\nbut, like its neighbors of Italy and Provence, for lack of serious\r\nintention, it could not last.\r\n\r\nOf all these marvels the narrators make display in their stories. Here\r\nis a picture of the vessel which took the mother of King Richard into\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Swlk on ne seygh they never non;\r\nAll it was whyt of huel-bon,\r\nAnd every nayl with gold begrave:\r\nOff pure gold was the stave.\r\nHer mast was of yvory;\r\nOff samyte the sayl wytterly.\r\nHer ropes wer off tuely sylk,\r\nAl so whyt as ony mylk.\r\nThat noble schyp was al withoute,\r\nWith clothys of golde sprede aboute;\r\nAnd her loof and her wyndas,\r\nOff asure forsothe it was.\"[145]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn such subjects they never run dry. When the King of Hungary wishes to\r\nconsole his afflicted daughter, he proposes to take her to the chase in\r\nthe following style:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow ye shall in hunting fare:\r\nAnd ride, my daughter, in a chair;\r\nIt shall be covered with velvet red,\r\nAnd cloths of fine gold all about your head,\r\nWith damask white and azure blue,\r\nWell diapered with lilies new.\r\nYour pommels shall be ended with gold,\r\nYour chains enamelled many a fold,\r\nYour mantle of rich degree,\r\nPurple pall and ermine free.\r\nJennets of Spain that ben so light,\r\nTrapped to the ground with velvet bright.\r\nYe shall have harp, sautry, and song,\r\nAnd other mirths you among.\r\nYe shall have Rumney and Malespine,\r\nBoth hippocras and Vernage wine;\r\nMontrese and wine of Greek,\r\nBoth Algrade and despice eke,\r\nAntioch and Bastarde,\r\nPyment also and garnarde;\r\nWine of Greek and Muscadel,\r\nBoth clare, pyment, and Rochelle,\r\nThe reed your stomach to defy,\r\nAnd pots of osey set you by.\r\nYou shall have venison ybake,\r\nThe best wild fowl that may be take;\r\nA leish of harehound with you to streek,\r\nAnd hart, and hind, and other like.\r\nYe shall be set at such a tryst,\r\nThat hart and hynd shall come to you fist,\r\nYour disease to drive you fro,\r\nTo hear the bugles there yblow.\r\nHomeward thus shall ye ride,\r\nOn hawking by the river's side,\r\nWith gosshawk and with gentle falcon,\r\nWith bugle-horn and merlion.\r\nWhen you come home your menie among,\r\nYe shall have revel, dance, and song;\r\nLittle children, great and small,\r\nShall sing as does the nightingale.\r\nThen shall ye go to your evensong,\r\nWith tenors and trebles among.\r\nThreescore of copes of damask bright,\r\nFull of pearls they shall be pight.\r\nYour censors shall be of gold,\r\nIndent with azure many a fold;\r\nYour quire nor organ song shall want,\r\nWith contre-note and descant.\r\nThe other half on organs playing,\r\nWith young children full fain singing.\r\nThen shall ye go to your supper,\r\nAnd sit in tents in green arber,\r\nWith cloth of arras pight to the ground,\r\nWith sapphires set of diamond.\r\nA hundred knights, truly told,\r\nShall play with bowls in alleys cold,\r\nYour disease to drive away;\r\nTo see the fishes in pools play,\r\nTo a drawbridge then shall ye,\r\nTh' one half of stone, th' other of tree;\r\nA barge shall meet you full right,\r\nWith twenty-four oars full bright,\r\nWith trumpets and with clarion,\r\nThe fresh water to row up and down....\r\nForty torches burning bright\r\nAt your bridge to bring you light.\r\nInto your chamber they shall you bring,\r\nWith much mirth and more liking.\r\nYour blankets shall be of fustian,\r\nYour sheets shall be of cloth of Rennes.\r\nYour head sheet shall be of pery pight,\r\nWith diamonds set and rubies bright.\r\nWhen you are laid in bed so soft,\r\nA cage of gold shall hang aloft,\r\nWith long paper fair burning,\r\nAnd cloves that be sweet smelling.\r\nFrankincense and olibanum,\r\nThat when ye sleep the taste may come;\r\nAnd if ye no rest can take,\r\nAll night minstrels for you shall wake.\"[146]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid such fancies and splendors the poets delight and lose themselves,\r\nand the woof, like the embroideries of their canvas, bears the mark of\r\nthis love of decoration. They weave it out of adventures, of\r\nextraordinary and surprising events. Now it is the life of King Horn,\r\nwho, thrown into a boat when a lad, is wrecked upon the coast of\r\nEngland, and, becoming a knight, reconquers the kingdom of his father.\r\nNow it is the history of Sir Guy, who rescues enchanted knights, cuts\r\ndown the giant Colbrand, challenges and kills the Sultan in his tent. It\r\nis not for me to recount these poems, which are not English, but only\r\ntranslations; still, here as in France, there are many of them; they\r\nfill the imagination of the young society, and they grow in\r\nexaggeration, until, falling to the lowest depth of insipidity and\r\nimprobability, they are buried forever by Cervantes. What would people\r\nsay of a society which had no literature but the opera with its\r\nunrealities? Yet it was a literature of this kind which formed the\r\nintellectual food of the Middle Ages. People then did not ask for truth,\r\nbut entertainment, and that vehement and hollow, full of glare and\r\nstartling events. They asked for impossible voyages, extravagant\r\nchallenges, a racket of contests, a confusion of magnificence and\r\nentanglement of chances. For introspective history they had no liking,\r\ncared nothing for the adventures of the heart, devoted their attention\r\nto the outside. They remained children to the last, with eyes glued to a\r\nseries of exaggerated and colored images, and, for lack of thinking, did\r\nnot perceive that they had learnt nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat was there beneath this fanciful dream? Brutal and evil human\r\npassions, unchained at first by religious fury, then delivered up to\r\ntheir own devices, and, beneath a show of external courtesy, as vile as\r\never. Look at the popular king, Richard Cœur de Lion, and reckon up his\r\nbutcheries and murders: \"King Richard,\" says a poem, \"is the best king\r\never mentioned in song.\"[147] I have no objection; but if he has the\r\nheart of a lion, he has also that brute's appetite. One day, under the\r\nwalls of Acre, being convalescent, he had a great desire for some pork.\r\nThere was no pork. They killed a young Saracen, fresh and tender, cooked\r\nand salted him, and the king ate him and found him very good; whereupon\r\nhe desired to see the head of the pig. The cook brought it in trembling.\r\nThe king falls a-laughing, and says the army has nothing to fear from\r\nfamine, having provisions ready at hand. He takes the town, and\r\npresently Saladin's ambassadors come to sue for pardon for the\r\nprisoners. Richard has thirty of the most noble beheaded, and bids his\r\ncook boil the heads, and serve one to each ambassador, with a ticket\r\nbearing the name and family of the dead man. Meanwhile, in their\r\npresence, he eats his own with a relish, bids them tell Saladin how the\r\nChristians make war, and ask him if it is true that they fear him. Then\r\nhe orders the sixty thousand prisoners to be led into the plain:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They were led into the place full even.\r\nThere they heard angels of heaven;\r\nThey said: 'Seigneures, tuez, tuez!\r\nSpares hem nought, and beheadeth these!'\r\nKing Richard heard the angels' voice,\r\nAnd thanked God and the holy cross.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon they behead them all. When he took a town, it was his wont to\r\nmurder everyone, even children and women. Such was the devotion of the\r\nMiddle Ages, not only in romances, as here, but in history. At the\r\ntaking of Jerusalem the whole population, seventy thousand persons, were\r\nmassacred.\r\n\r\nThus even in chivalrous stories the fierce and unbridled instincts of\r\nthe bloodthirsty brute break out. The authentic narratives show it.\r\nHenry II, irritated at a page, attempted to tear out his eyes.[148] John\r\nLackland let twenty-three hostages die in prison of hunger. Edward II\r\ncaused at one time twenty-eight nobles to be hanged and disemboweled,\r\nand was himself put to death by the insertion of a red-hot iron into his\r\nbowels. Look in Froissart for the debaucheries and murders in France as\r\nwell as in England, of the Hundred Years' War, and then for the\r\nslaughters of the Wars of the Roses. In both countries feudal\r\nindependence ended in civil war, and the Middle Age founders under its\r\nvices. Chivalrous courtesy, which cloaked the native ferocity,\r\ndisappears like some hangings suddenly consumed by the breaking out of a\r\nfire; at that time in England they killed nobles in preference, and\r\nprisoners, too, even children, with insults, in cold blood. What, then,\r\ndid man learn in this civilization and by this literature? How was he\r\nhumanized? What precepts of justice, habits of reflection, store of true\r\njudgments, did this culture interpose between his desires and his\r\nactions, in order to moderate his passion? He dreamed, he imagined a\r\nsort of elegant ceremonial in order the better to address lords and\r\nladies; he discovered the gallant code of little Jehan de Saintré. But\r\nwhere is the true education? Wherein has Froissart profited by all his\r\nvast experience? He was a fine specimen of a babbling child; what they\r\ncalled his poesy, the _poèsie neuve_, is only a refined gabble, a\r\nsenile puerility. Some rhetoricians, like Christine de Pisan, try to\r\nround their periods after an ancient model; but all their literature\r\namounts to nothing. No one can think. Sir John Maundeville, who\r\ntravelled all over the world a hundred and fifty years after\r\nVillehardouin, is as contracted in his ideas as Villehardouin himself.\r\nExtraordinary legends and fables, every sort of credulity and ignorance,\r\nabound in his book. When he wishes to explain why Palestine has passed\r\ninto the hands of various possessors instead of continuing under one\r\ngovernment, he says that it is because God would not that it should\r\ncontinue longer in the hands of traitors and sinners, whether Christians\r\nor others. He has seen at Jerusalem, on the steps of the temple, the\r\nfootmarks of the ass which our Lord rode on Palm Sunday. He describes\r\nthe Ethiopians as a people who have only one foot, but so large that\r\nthey can make use of it as a parasol. He instances one island \"where be\r\npeople as big as gyants, of 28 feet long, and have no clothing but\r\nbeasts' skins\"; then another island \"where there are many evil and foul\r\nwomen, but have precious stones in their eyes, and have such force that\r\nif they behold any man with wrath, they slay him with beholding, as the\r\nbasilisk doth.\" The good man relates; that is all: doubt and\r\ncommon-sense scarcely exist in the world he lives in. He has neither\r\njudgment nor reflection; he piles facts one on top of another, with no\r\nfurther connection; his book is simply a mirror which reproduces\r\nrecollections of his eyes and ears. \"And all those who will say a Pater\r\nand an Ave Maria in my behalf, I give them an interest and a share in\r\nall the holy pilgrimages I ever made in my life.\" That is his farewell,\r\nand accords with all the rest. Neither public morality nor public\r\nknowledge has gained anything from these three centuries of culture.\r\nThis French culture, copied in vain throughout Europe, has but\r\nsuperficially adorned mankind, and the varnish with which it decked them\r\nis already tarnished everywhere or scales off. It was worse in England,\r\nwhere the thing was more superficial and the application worse than in\r\nFrance, where foreign hands laid it on, and where it could only half\r\ncover the Saxon crust, where that crust was worn away and rough. That is\r\nthe reason why, during three centuries, throughout the whole first\r\nfeudal age, the literature of the Normans in England, made up of\r\nimitations, translations, and clumsy copies, ends in nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--Feudal Civilization\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, what has become of the conquered people? Has the old stock, on\r\nwhich the brilliant Continental flowers were grafted, engendered no\r\nliterary shoot of its own? Did it continue barren during all this time\r\nunder the Norman axe, which stripped it of all its buds? It grew very\r\nfeebly, but it grew nevertheless. The subjugated race is not a\r\ndismembered nation, dislocated, uprooted, sluggish, like the populations\r\nof the Continent, which, after the long Roman oppression, were given up\r\nto the unrestrained invasion of barbarians; it increased, remained fixed\r\nin its own soil, full of sap: its members were not displaced; it was\r\nsimply lopped in order to receive on its crown a cluster of foreign\r\nbranches. True, it had suffered, but at last the wound closed, the saps\r\nmingled. Even the hard, stiff ligatures with which the Conqueror bound\r\nit, henceforth contributed to its fixity and vigor. The land was mapped\r\nout; every title verified, defined in writing;[149] every right or\r\ntenure valued; every man registered as to his locality, and also his\r\ncondition, duties, descent, and resources, so that the whole nation was\r\nenveloped in a network of which not a mesh would break. Its future\r\ndevelopment had to be within these limits. Its constitution was settled,\r\nand in this positive and stringent enclosure men were compelled to\r\nunfold themselves and to act. Solidarity and strife; these were the two\r\neffects of the great and orderly establishment which shaped and held\r\ntogether, on one side the aristocracy of the conquerors, on the other\r\nthe conquered people; even as in Rome the systematic fusing of conquered\r\npeoples into the plebs, and the constrained organization of the\r\npatricians in contrast with the plebs, enrolled the private individuals\r\nin two orders, whose opposition and union formed the state. Thus, here\r\nas in Rome, the national character was moulded and completed by the\r\nhabit of corporate action, the respect for written law, political and\r\npractical aptitude, the development of combative and patient energy. It\r\nwas the Domesday Book which, binding this young society in a rigid\r\ndiscipline, made of the Saxon the Englishman of our own day.\r\n\r\nGradually and slowly, amidst the gloomy complainings of the chroniclers,\r\nwe find the new man fashioned by action, like a child who cries because\r\nsteel stays, though they improve his figure, give him pain. However\r\nreduced and downtrodden the Saxons were, they did not all sink into the\r\npopulace. Some,[150] almost in every county, remained lords of their\r\nestates, on the condition of doing homage for them to the king. Many\r\nbecame vassals of Norman barons, and remained proprietors on this\r\ncondition. A greater number became socagers, that is, free proprietors,\r\nburdened with a tax, but possessed of the right of alienating their\r\nproperty; and the Saxon villeins found patrons in these, as the plebs\r\nformerly did in the Italian nobles who were transplanted to Rome. The\r\npatronage of the Saxons who preserved their integral position was\r\neffective, for they were not isolated: marriages from the first united\r\nthe two races, as it had the patricians and plebeians of Rome;[151] a\r\nNorman brother-in-law to a Saxon, defended himself in defending him. In\r\nthose turbulent times, and in an armed community, relatives and allies\r\nwere obliged to stand shoulder to shoulder in order to keep their\r\nground. After all, it was necessary for the new-comers to consider their\r\nsubjects, for these subjects had the heart and courage of men: the\r\nSaxons, like the plebeians at Rome, remembered their native rank and\r\ntheir original independence. We can recognize it in the complaints and\r\nindignation of the chroniclers, in the growling and menaces of popular\r\nrevolt, in the long bitterness with which they continually recalled\r\ntheir ancient liberty, in the favor with which they cherished the daring\r\nand rebellion of outlaws. There were Saxon families at the end of the\r\ntwelfth century who had bound themselves by a perpetual vow to wear long\r\nbeards from father to son in memory of the national custom and of the\r\nold country. Such men, even though fallen to the condition of socagers,\r\neven sunk into villeins, had a stiffer neck than the wretched colonists\r\nof the Continent, trodden down and moulded by four centuries of Roman\r\ntaxation. By their feelings as well as by their condition, they were the\r\nbroken remains, but also the living elements, of a free people. They did\r\nnot suffer the extremities of oppression. They constituted the body of\r\nthe nation, the laborious, courageous body which supplied its energy.\r\nThe great barons felt that they must rely upon them in their resistance\r\nto the king. Very soon, in stipulating for themselves, they stipulated\r\nfor all freemen,[152] even for merchants and villeins. Thereafter \"No\r\nmerchant shall be dispossessed of his merchandise, no villein of the\r\ninstruments of his labor; no freeman, merchant, or villein shall be\r\ntaxed unreasonably for a small crime; no freeman shall be arrested, or\r\nimprisoned, or disseized of his land, or outlawed, or destroyed in any\r\nmanner, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the\r\nland.\" Thus protected they raise themselves and act. In each county\r\nthere was a court, where all freeholders, small or great, came to\r\ndeliberate about the municipal affairs, administer justice, and appoint\r\ntax-assessors. The red-bearded Saxon, with his clear complexion and\r\ngreat white teeth, came and sat by the Norman's side; these were\r\nfranklins like the one whom Chaucer describes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Frankelein was in this compagnie;\r\nWhite was his herd, as is the dayesie.\r\nOf his complexion he was sanguin,\r\nWel loved he by the morwe a sop in win.\r\nTo liven in delit was ever his wone,\r\nFor he was Epicures owen sone,\r\nThat held opinion that plein delit\r\nWas veraily felicite parfite.\r\nAn housholder, and that a grete was he,\r\nSeint Julian he was in his contree.\r\nHis brede, his ale, was alway after on;\r\nA better envyned man was no wher non.\r\nWithouten bake mete never his hous,\r\nOf fish and flesh, and that so plenteous,\r\nIt snewed in his hous of mete and drinke,\r\nOf all deintees that men coud of thinke;\r\nAfter the sondry sesons of the yere,\r\nSo changed he his mete and his soupere.\r\nFul many a fat partrich had he in mewe,\r\nAnd many a breme, and many a luce in stewe.\r\nWo was his coke but if his sauce were\r\nPoinant and sharpe, and redy all his gere.\r\nHis table, dormant in his halle alway\r\nStode redy covered alle the longe day.\r\nAt sessions ther was he lord and sire.\r\nFul often time he was knight of the shire.\r\nAn anelace and a gipciere all of silk,\r\nHeng at his girdle, white as morwe milk.\r\nA shereve hadde he ben, and a contour.\r\nWas no wher swiche a worthy vavasour.\"[153]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith him occasionally in the assembly, oftenest among the audience, were\r\nthe yeomen, farmers, foresters, tradesmen, his fellow-countrymen,\r\nmuscular and resolute men, not slow in the defence of their property,\r\nand in supporting him who would take their cause in hand, with voice,\r\nfist and weapons. Is it likely that the discontent of such men to whom\r\nthe following description applies could be overlooked?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Miller was a stout carl for the nones,\r\nFul bigge he was of braun and eke of bones;\r\nThat proved wel, for over all ther he came,\r\nAt wrastling he wold bere away the ram.\r\nHe was short shuldered brode, a thikke gnarre,\r\nTher n'as no dore, that he n'olde heve of barre,\r\nOr breke it at a renning with his hede.\r\nHis berd as any sowe or fox was rede,\r\nAnd therto brode, as though it were a spade.\r\nUpon the cop right of his nose he hade\r\nA wert, and thereon stode a tufte of heres,\r\nRede as the bristles of a sowes eres:\r\nHis nose-thirles blacke were and wide.\r\nA swerd and bokeler bare he by his side.\r\nHis mouth as wide was as a forneis,\r\nHe was a jangler and a goliardeis,\r\nAnd that was most of sinne, and harlotries.\r\nWel coude he stelen corne and tollen thries.\r\nAnd yet he had a thomb of gold parde.\r\nA white cote and a blew hode wered he.\r\nA baggepipe wel coude he blowe and soune,\r\nAnd therwithall he brought us out of toune.\"[154]\r\n\r\n\r\nThose are the athletic forms, the square build, the jolly John Bulls of\r\nthe period, such as we yet find them, nourished by meat and porter,\r\nsustained by bodily exercise and boxing. These are the men we must keep\r\nbefore us, if we will understand how political liberty has been\r\nestablished in this country. Gradually they find the simple knights,\r\ntheir colleagues in the county court, too poor to be present with the\r\ngreat barons at the royal assemblies, coalescing with them. They become\r\nunited by community of interests, by similarity of manners, by nearness\r\nof condition; they take them for their representatives, they elect\r\nthem.[155] They have now entered upon public life, and the advent of a\r\nnew reinforcement gives them a perpetual standing in their changed\r\ncondition. The towns laid waste by the Conquest are gradually repeopled.\r\nThey obtain or exact charters; the townsmen buy themselves out of the\r\narbitrary taxes that were imposed on them; they get possession of the\r\nland on which their houses are built; they unite themselves under mayors\r\nand aldermen. Each town now, within the meshes of the great feudal net,\r\nis a power. The Earl of Leicester, rebelling against the king, summons\r\ntwo burgesses from each town to Parliament,[156] to authorize and\r\nsupport him. From that time the conquered race, both in country and\r\ntown, rose to political life. If they were taxed, it was with their\r\nconsent; they paid nothing which they did not agree to. Early in the\r\nfourteenth century their united deputies composed the House of Commons;\r\nand already, at the close of the preceding century, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, speaking in the name of the king, said to the pope, \"It is\r\nthe custom of the kingdom of England, that in all affairs relating to\r\nthe state of this kingdom, the advice of all who are interested in them\r\nshould be taken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--Persistence of Saxon Ideas\r\n\r\n\r\nIf they have acquired liberties, it is because they have obtained them\r\nby force; circumstances have assisted, but character has done more. The\r\nprotection of the great barons and the alliance of the plain knights\r\nhave strengthened them; but it was by their native roughness and energy\r\nthat they maintained their independence. Look at the contrast they offer\r\nat this moment to their neighbors. What occupies the mind of the French\r\npeople? The fabliaux, the naughty tricks of Reynard, the art of\r\ndeceiving Master Isengrin, of stealing his wife, of cheating him out of\r\nhis dinner, of getting him beaten by a third party without danger to\r\none's self; in short, the triumph of poverty and cleverness over power\r\nunited to folly. The popular hero is already the artful plebeian,\r\nchaffing, light-hearted, who, later on, will ripen into Panurge and\r\nFigaro, not apt to withstand you to your face, too sharp to care for\r\ngreat victories and habits of strife, inclined by the nimbleness of his\r\nwit to dodge round an obstacle; if he but touch a man with the tip of\r\nhis finger, that man tumbles into the trap. But here we have other\r\ncustoms: it is Robin Hood, a valiant outlaw, living free and bold in the\r\ngreen forest, waging frank and open war against sheriff and law.[157] If\r\never a man was popular in his country, it was he. \"It is he,\" says an\r\nold historian, \"whom the common people love so dearly to celebrate in\r\ngames and comedies, and whose history, sung by fiddlers, interests them\r\nmore than any other.\" In the sixteenth century he still had his\r\ncommemoration day, observed by all the people in the small towns and in\r\nthe country. Bishop Latimer, making his pastoral tour, announced one day\r\nthat he would preach in a certain place. On the morrow, proceeding to\r\nthe church, he found the doors closed, and waited more than an hour\r\nbefore they brought him the key. At last a man came and said to him,\r\n\"Syr, thys ys a busye day with us; we cannot heare you: it is Robyn\r\nHoodes Daye. The parishe are gone abrode to gather for Robyn Hoode.... I\r\nwas fayne there to geve place to Robyn Hoode.\"[158] The bishop was\r\nobliged to divest himself of his ecclesiastical garments and proceed on\r\nhis journey, leaving his place to archers dressed in green, who played\r\non a rustic stage the parts of Robin Hood, Little John, and their band.\r\nIn fact, he was the national hero. Saxon in the first place and waging\r\nwar against the men of law, against bishops and archbishops, whose sway\r\nwas so heavy; generous, moreover, giving to a poor ruined knight\r\nclothes, horse, and money to buy back the land he had pledged to a\r\nrapacious abbot; compassionate too, and kind to the poor, enjoining his\r\nmen not to injure yeomen and laborers; but above all, rash, bold, proud,\r\nwho would go and draw his bow before the sheriff's eyes and to his face;\r\nready with blows, whether to give or take. He slew fourteen out of\r\nfifteen foresters who came to arrest him; he slays the sheriff, the\r\njudge, the town gatekeeper; he is ready to slay as many more as like to\r\ncome; and all this joyously, jovially, like an honest fellow who eats\r\nwell, has a hard skin, lives in the open air, and revels in animal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In somer when the shawes be sheyne,\r\nAnd leves be large and long,\r\nHit is fulle mery in feyre foreste\r\nTo here the foulys song.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is how many ballads begin; and the fine weather, which makes the\r\nstags and oxen butt with their horns, inspires them with the thought of\r\nexchanging blows with sword or stick. Robin dreamed that two yeomen were\r\nthrashing him, and he wants to go and find them, angrily repelling\r\nLittle John, who offers to go first:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah John, by me thou settest noe store,\r\nAnd that I farley finde:\r\nHow offt send I my men before,\r\nAnd tarry myselfe behinde?\r\n\r\n\"It is no cunnin a knave to ken,\r\nAn a man but heare him speake;\r\nAn it were not for bursting of my bowe,\r\nJohn, I thy head wold breake.\"[159]...\r\n\r\n\r\nHe goes alone, and meets the robust yeoman, Guy of Gisborne,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He that had neyther beene kythe nor kin,\r\nMight have seen a full fayre fight,\r\nTo see how together these yeomen went\r\nWith blades both browne and bright,\r\n\r\n\"To see how these yeomen together they fought\r\nTwo howres of a summer's day;\r\nYett neither Robin Hood nor sir Guy\r\nThem fettled to flye away.\"[160]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see Guy the yeoman is as brave as Robin Hood; he came to seek him in\r\nthe wood, and drew the bow almost as well as he. This old popular poetry\r\nis not the praise of a single bandit, but of an entire class, the\r\nyeomanry. \"God haffe mersy on Robin Hodys solle, and saffe all god\r\nyemanry.\" That is how many ballads end. The brave yeoman, inured to\r\nblows, a good archer, clever at sword and stick, is the favorite. There\r\nwere also, redoubtable, armed townsfolk, accustomed to make use of their\r\narms. Here they are at work:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'O that were a shame,' said jolly Robin,\r\n'We being three, and thou but one,'\r\nThe pinder[161] leapt back then thirty good foot,\r\n'Twas thirty good foot and one.\r\n\r\n\"He leaned his back fast unto a thorn,\r\nAnd his foot against a stone,\r\nAnd there he fought a long summer's day,\r\nA summer's day so long.\r\n\r\n\"Till that their swords on their broad bucklers\r\nWere broke fast into their hands.\"[162]\r\n\r\n\r\nOften even Robin does not get the advantage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'I pass not for length,' bold Arthur reply'd,\r\n'My staff is of oke so free;\r\nEight foot and a half, it will knock down a calf,\r\nAnd I hope it will knock down thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Then Robin could no longer forbear,\r\nHe gave him such a knock,\r\nQuickly and soon the blood came down\r\nBefore it was ten a clock.\r\n\r\n\"Then Arthur he soon recovered himself,\r\nAnd gave him such a knock on the crown,\r\nThat from every side of bold Robin Hood's head\r\nThe blood came trickling down.\r\n\r\n\"Then Robin raged like a wild boar,\r\nAs soon as he saw his own blood:\r\nThen Bland was in hast, he laid on so fast,\r\nAs though he had been cleaving of wood.\r\n\r\n\"And about and about and about they went,\r\nLike two wild bores in a chase,\r\nStriving to aim each other to maim,\r\nLeg, arm, or any other place.\r\n\r\n\"And knock for knock they lustily dealt,\r\nWhich held for two hours and more,\r\nTill all the wood rang at every bang,\r\nThey ply'd their work so sore.\r\n\r\n\"Hold thy hand, hold thy hand,' said Robin Hood,\r\n'And let thy quarrel fall;\r\nFor here we may thrash our bones all to mesh,\r\nAnd get no coyn at all.\r\n\r\n\"And in the forrest of merry Sherwood,\r\nHereafter thou shalt be free.'\r\n'God a mercy for nought, my freedom I bought,\r\nI may thank my staff, and not thee.'\"[163]...\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, then?\" says Robin:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'I am a tanner,' bold Arthur reply'd,\r\n'In Nottingham long I have wrought;\r\nAnd if thou'lt come there, I vow and swear,\r\nI will tan thy hide for nought.'\r\n\r\n\"'God a mercy, good fellow,' said jolly Robin,\r\n'Since thou art so kind and free;\r\nAnd if thou wilt tan my hide for nought,\r\nI will do as much for thee.'\"[164]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these generous offers, they embrace; a free exchange of honest\r\nblows always prepares the way for friendship. It was so Robin Hood tried\r\nLittle John, whom he loved all his life after. Little John was seven\r\nfeet high, and being on a bridge, would not give way. Honest Robin would\r\nnot use his bow against him, but went and cut a stick seven feet long;\r\nand they agreed amicably to fight on the bridge until one should fall\r\ninto the water. They fall to so merrily that \"their bones ring.\" In the\r\nend Robin falls, and he feels only the more respect for Little John.\r\nAnother time, having a sword with him, he was thrashed by a tinker who\r\nhad only a stick. Full of admiration, he gives him a hundred pounds.\r\nAgain he was thrashed by a potter, who refused him toll; then by a\r\nshepherd. They fight to amuse themselves. Even nowadays boxers give each\r\nother a friendly grip before setting to; they knock one another about in\r\nthis country honorably, without malice, fury, or shame. Broken teeth,\r\nblack eyes, smashed ribs, do not call for murderous vengeance: it would\r\nseem that the bones are more solid and the nerves less sensitive in\r\nEngland than elsewhere. Blows once exchanged, they take each other by\r\nthe hand, and dance together on the green grass:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then Robin took them both by the hands,\r\nAnd danc'd round about the oke tree.\r\n'For three merry men, and three merry men,\r\nAnd three merry men we be.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, these people, in each parish, practised the bow every Sunday,\r\nand were the best archers in the world; from the close of the fourteenth\r\ncentury the general emancipation of the villeins multiplied their number\r\ngreatly, and you can now understand how, amidst all the operations and\r\nchanges of the great central powers, the liberty of the subject\r\nsurvived. After all, the only permanent and unalterable guarantee, in\r\nevery country and under every constitution, is this unspoken declaration\r\nin the heart of the mass of the people, which is well understood on all\r\nsides: \"If any man touches my property, enters my house, obstructs or\r\nmolests me, let him beware. I have patience, but I have also strong\r\narms, good comrades, a good blade, and, on occasion, a firm resolve,\r\nhappen what may, to plunge my blade up to its hilt in his throat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.--The English Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\nThus thought Sir John Fortescue, Chancellor of England under Henry VI,\r\nexiled in France during the Wars of the Roses, one of the oldest\r\nprose-writers, and the first who weighed and explained the constitution\r\nof his country.[165] He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is cowardise and lack of hartes and corage that kepeth the Frenchmen\r\nfrom rysyng, and not povertye;[166] which corage no Frenche man hath\r\nlike to the English man. It hath ben often seen in Englond that iij or\r\niv thefes, for povertie, hath sett upon vij or viij true men, and robbyd\r\nthem al. But it hath not ben seen in Fraunce, that vij or viij thefes\r\nhave ben hardy to robbe iij or iv true men. Wherfor it is right seld\r\nthat Frenchmen be hangyd for robberye, for that they have no hertys to\r\ndo so terryble an acte. There be therfor mo men hangyd in Englond, in a\r\nyere, for robberye and manslaughter, than ther be hangid in Fraunce for\r\nsuch cause of crime in vij yers.\"[167]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis throws a startling and terrible light on the violent condition of\r\nthis armed community, where sudden attacks are an every-day matter, and\r\neveryone, rich and poor, lives with his hand on his sword. There were\r\ngreat bands of malefactors under Edward I, who infested the country, and\r\nfought with those who came to seize them. The inhabitants of the towns\r\nwere obliged to gather together with those of the neighboring towns,\r\nwith hue and cry, to pursue and capture them. Under Edward III there\r\nwere barons who rode about with armed escorts and archers, seizing the\r\nmanors, carrying off ladies and girls of high degree, mutilating,\r\nkilling, extorting ransoms from people in their own houses, as if they\r\nwere in an enemy's land, and sometimes coming before the judges at the\r\nsessions in such guise and in so great force that the judges were afraid\r\nand dared not administer justice.[168] Read the letters of the Paston\r\nfamily, under Henry VI and Edward IV, and you will see how private war\r\nwas at every door, how it was necessary for a man to provide himself\r\nwith men and arms, to be on the alert for defence of his property, to be\r\nself-reliant, to depend on his own strength and courage. It is this\r\nexcess of vigor and readiness to fight which, after their victories in\r\nFrance, set them against one another in England, in the butcheries of\r\nthe Wars of the Roses. The strangers who saw them were astonished at\r\ntheir bodily strength and courage, at the great pieces of beef \"which\r\nfeed their muscles, at their military habits, their fierce obstinacy, as\r\nof savage beasts.\"[169] They are like their bulldogs, an untamable race,\r\nwho in their mad courage \"cast themselves with shut eyes into the den of\r\na Russian bear, and get their head broken like a rotten apple.\" This\r\nstrange condition of a militant community, so full of danger, and\r\nrequiring so much effort, does not make them afraid. King Edward having\r\ngiven orders to send disturbers of the peace to prison without legal\r\nproceedings, and not to liberate them, on bail or otherwise, the Commons\r\ndeclared the order \"horribly vexatious\"; resist it, refuse to be too\r\nmuch protected. Less peace, but more independence. They maintain the\r\nguarantees of the subject at the expense of public security, and prefer\r\nturbulent liberty to arbitrary order. Better suffer marauders whom they\r\ncould fight, than magistrates under whom they would have to bend.\r\n\r\nThis proud and persistent notion gives rise to, and fashions Fortescue's\r\nwhole work:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ther be two kynds of kyngdomys, of the which that one ys a lordship\r\ncallid in Latyne Dominium regale, and that other is callid Dominium\r\npoliticum et regale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first is established in France, and the second in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And they dyversen in that the first may rule his people by such lawys\r\nas he makyth hymself, and therefor, he may set upon them talys, and\r\nother impositions, such as he wyl hymself, without their assent. The\r\nsecund may not rule hys people by other laws than such as they assenten\r\nunto; and therfor he may set upon them non impositions without their own\r\nassent.\"[170]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a state like this, the will of the people is the prime element of\r\nlife. Sir John Fortescue says further:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A king of England cannot at his pleasure make any alterations in the\r\nlaws of the land, for the nature of his government is not only regal,\r\nbut political.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the body politic, the first thing which lives and moves is the\r\nintention of the people, having in it the blood, that is, the prudential\r\ncare and provision for the public good, which it transmits and\r\ncommunicates to the head, as to the principal part, and to all the rest\r\nof the members of the said body politic, whereby it subsists and is\r\ninvigorated. The law under which the people is incorporated may be\r\ncompared to the nerves or sinews of the body natural.... And as the\r\nbones and all the other members of the body preserve their functions and\r\ndischarge their several offices by the nerves, so do the members of the\r\ncommunity by the law. And as the head of the body natural cannot change\r\nits nerves or sinews, cannot deny to the several parts their proper\r\nenergy, their due proportion and aliment of blood, neither can a king\r\nwho is the head of the body politic change the laws thereof, nor take\r\nfrom the people what is theirs by right, against their consents.... For\r\nhe is appointed to protect his subjects in their lives, properties, and\r\nlaws, for this very end and purpose he has the delegation of power from\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have all the ideas of Locke in the fifteenth century, so\r\npowerful is practice to suggest theory! so quickly does man discover, in\r\nthe enjoyment of liberty, the nature of liberty! Fortescue goes further;\r\nhe contrasts, step by step, the Roman law, that inheritance of all Latin\r\npeoples, with the English law, that heritage of all Teutonic peoples:\r\none the work of absolute princes, and tending altogether to the\r\nsacrifice of the individual; the other the work of the common will,\r\ntending altogether to protect the person. He contrasts the maxims of the\r\nimperial jurisconsults, who accord \"force of law to all which is\r\ndetermined by the prince,\" with the statutes of England, which \"are not\r\nenacted by the sole will of the prince,... but with the concurrent\r\nconsent of the whole kingdom, by their representatives in Parliament,...\r\nmore than three hundred select persons.\" He contrasts the arbitrary\r\nnomination of imperial officers with the election of the sheriff, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is in every county a certain officer, called the king's sheriff,\r\nwho, amongst other duties of his office, executes within his county all\r\nmandates and judgments of the king's courts of justice: he is an annual\r\nofficer; and it is not lawful for him, after the expiration of his year,\r\nto continue to act in his said office, neither shall he be taken in\r\nagain to execute the said office within two years thence next ensuing.\r\nThe manner of his election is thus: Every year, on the morrow of\r\nAll-Souls, there meet in the King's Court of Exchequer all the king's\r\ncounsellors, as well lords spiritual and temporal, as all other the\r\nking's justices, all the barons of the Exchequer, the Master of the\r\nRolls, and certain other officers, when all of them, by common consent,\r\nnominate three of every county knights or esquires, persons of\r\ndistinction, and such as they esteem fittest qualified to bear the\r\noffice of sheriff of that county for the year ensuing. The king only\r\nmakes choice of one out of the three so nominated and returned, who, in\r\nvirtue of the king's letters patent, is constituted High Sheriff of that\r\ncounty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe contrasts the Roman procedure, which is satisfied with two witnesses\r\nto condemn a man, with the jury, the three permitted challenges, the\r\nadmirable guarantees of justice with which the uprightness, number,\r\nrepute, and condition of the juries surround the sentence. About the\r\njuries he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Twelve good and true men being sworn, as in the manner above related,\r\nlegally qualified, that is, having, over and besides their movables,\r\npossessions in land sufficient, as was said, wherewith to maintain their\r\nrank and station; neither inspected by, nor at variance with either of\r\nthe parties; all of the neighborhood; there shall be read to them, in\r\nEnglish, by the Court, the record and nature of the plea.\"[171]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus protected, the English commons cannot be other than flourishing.\r\nConsider, on the other hand, he says to the young prince whom he is\r\ninstructing, the condition of the commons in France. By their taxes, tax\r\non salt, on wine, billeting of soldiers, they are reduced to great\r\nmisery. You have seen them on your travels....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The same Commons be so impoverishid and distroyyd, that they may unneth\r\nlyve. Thay drink water, thay eate apples, with bred right brown made of\r\nrye. They eate no fleshe, but if it be selden, a litill larde, or of the\r\nentrails or heds of bests sclayne for the nobles and merchants of the\r\nland. They weryn no wollyn, but if it be a pore cote under their\r\nuttermost garment, made of grete convass, and cal it a frok. Their hosyn\r\nbe of like canvas, and passen not their knee, wherfor they be gartrid\r\nand their thyghs bare. Their wifs and children gone bare fote. ... For\r\nsum of them, that was wonte to pay to his lord for his tenement which he\r\nhyrith by the year a scute payth now to the kyng, over that scute, fyve\r\nskuts. Wher thrugh they be artyd by necessite so to watch, labour and\r\ngrub in the ground for their sustenance, that their nature is much\r\nwasted, and the kynd of them brought to nowght. Thay gone crokyd and ar\r\nfeeble, not able to fight nor to defend the realm; nor they have wepon,\r\nnor monye to buy them wepon withal.... This is the frute first of hyre\r\nJus regale.... But blessed be God, this land ys rulid under a better\r\nlawe, and therfor the people thereof be not in such penurye, nor therby\r\nhurt in their persons, but they be wealthie and have all things\r\nnecessarie to the sustenance of nature. Wherefore they be myghty and\r\nable to resyste the adversaries of the realms that do or will do them\r\nwrong. Loo, this is the fruit of Jus politicum et regale, under which we\r\nlyve.\"[172] \"Everye inhabiter of the realme of England useth and\r\nenjoyeth at his pleasure all the fruites that his land or cattel\r\nbeareth, with al the profits and commodities which by his owne travayle,\r\nor by the labour of others, hae gaineth; not hindered by the iniurie or\r\nwrong deteinement of anye man, but that hee shall bee allowed a\r\nreasonable recompence.[173]... Hereby it commeth to passe that the men\r\nof that lande are riche, havying aboundaunce of golde and silver, and\r\nother thinges necessarie for the maintenaunce of man's life. They drinke\r\nno water, unless it be so, that some for devotion, and uppon a zeale of\r\npenaunce, doe abstaine from other drinks. They eate plentifully of all\r\nkindes of fleshe and fishe. They weare fine woolen cloth in all their\r\napparel; they have also aboundaunce of bed-coveringes in their houses,\r\nand of all other woolen stuffe. They have greate store of all\r\nhustlementes and implementes of householde, they are plentifully\r\nfurnished with al instruments of husbandry, and all other things that\r\nare requisite to the accomplishment of a quiet and wealthy lyfe,\r\naccording to their estates and degrees. Neither are they sued in the\r\nlawe, but onely before ordinary iudges, where by the lawes of the lande\r\nthey are iustly intreated. Neither are they arrested or impleaded for\r\ntheir moveables or possessions, or arraigned of any offence, bee it\r\nnever so great and outragious, but after the lawes of the land, and\r\nbefore the iudges aforesaid.\"[174]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this arises from the constitution of the country and the\r\ndistribution of the land. Whilst in other countries we find only a\r\npopulation of paupers, with here and there a few lords, England is\r\ncovered and filled with owners of lands and fields; so that \"therein so\r\nsmall a thorpe cannot bee founde, wherein dwelleth not a knight, an\r\nesquire, or suche a housholder as is there commonly called a franklayne,\r\nenryched with greate possessions. And also other freeholders, and many\r\nyeomen able for their livelodes to make a jurye in fourme\r\nafore-mentioned. For there bee in that lande divers yeomen, which are\r\nable to dispend by the yeare above a hundred poundes.\"[175] Harrison\r\nsays:[176]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This sort of people, have more estimation than labourers and the common\r\nsort of artificers, and these commonlie live wealthilie, keepe good\r\nhouses, and travell to get riches. They are for the most part farmers to\r\ngentlemen,\" and keep servants of their own. \"These were they that in\r\ntimes past made all France afraid. And albeit they be not called master,\r\nas gentlemen are, or sir, as to knights apperteineth, but onelie John\r\nand Thomas, etc., yet have they beene found to have done verie good\r\nservice; and the kings of England, in foughten battels, were wont to\r\nremaine among them (who were their footmen) as the French kings did\r\namong their horssemen: the prince thereby showing where his chiefe\r\nstrength did consist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch men, says Fortescue, might form a legal jury, and vote, resist, be\r\nassociated, do everything wherein a free government consists; for they\r\nwere numerous in every district; they were not down-trodden like the\r\ntimid peasants of France; they had their honor and that of their family\r\nto maintain; \"they be well provided with arms; they remember that they\r\nhave won battles in France.\"[177] Such is the class, still obscure, but\r\nmore rich and powerful every century, which, founded by the down-trodden\r\nSaxon aristocracy, and sustained by the surviving Saxon character,\r\nended, under the lead of the inferior Norman nobility and under the\r\npatronage of the superior Norman nobility, in establishing and settling\r\na free constitution, and a nation worthy of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.--Piers Plowman and Wyclif\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, as here, men are endowed with a serious character, have a resolute\r\nspirit, and possess independent habits, they deal with their conscience\r\nas with their daily business, and end by laying hands on church as well\r\nas state. Already for a long time the exactions of the Roman See had\r\nprovoked the resistance of the people,[178] and the higher clergy became\r\nunpopular. Men complained that the best livings were given by the pope\r\nto non-resident strangers; that some Italian, unknown in England,\r\npossessed fifty or sixty benefices in England; that English money poured\r\ninto Rome; and that the clergy, being judged only by clergy, gave\r\nthemselves up to their vices, and abused their state of immunity. In the\r\nfirst years of Henry III's reign there were nearly a hundred murders\r\ncommitted by priests then alive. At the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury the ecclesiastical revenue was twelve times greater than the\r\ncivil; about half the soil was in the hands of the clergy. At the end of\r\nthe century the commons declared that the taxes paid to the church were\r\nfive times greater than the taxes paid to the crown; and some years\r\nafterwards,[179] considering that the wealth of the clergy only served\r\nto keep them in idleness and luxury, they proposed to confiscate it for\r\nthe public benefit. Already the idea of the Reformation had forced\r\nitself upon them. They remembered how in the ballads Robin Hood ordered\r\nhis folk to spare the yeomen, laborers, even knights, if they are good\r\nfellows, but never to let abbots or bishops escape. The prelates were\r\ngrievously oppressing the people by means of their privileges,\r\necclesiastical courts, and tithes; when suddenly, amid the pleasant\r\nbanter or the monotonous babble of the Norman versifiers, we hear the\r\nindignant voice of a Saxon, a man of the people and a victim of\r\noppression, thundering against them.\r\n\r\nIt is the vision of Piers Plowman, written, it is supposed, by a secular\r\npriest of Oxford.[180] Doubtless the traces of French taste are\r\nperceptible. It could not be otherwise; the people from below can never\r\nquite prevent themselves from imitating the people above, and the most\r\nunshackled popular poets, Burns and Béranger, too often preserve an\r\nacademic style. So here a fashionable machinery, the allegory of the\r\nRoman de la Rose, is pressed into service. We have Do-well,\r\nCovetousness, Avarice, Simony, Conscience, and a whole world of talking\r\nabstractions. But, in spite of these vain foreign phantoms, the body of\r\nthe poem is national, and true to life. The old language reappears in\r\npart; the old metre altogether; no morer rhymes, but barbarous\r\nalliterations; no more jesting, but a harsh gravity, a sustained\r\ninvective, a grand and sombre imagination, heavy Latin texts, hammered\r\ndown as by a Protestant hand. Piers Plowman went to sleep on the Malvern\r\nhills, and there had a wonderful dream:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thanne gan I meten--a merveillous swevene,\r\nThat I was in a wildernesse--wiste I nevere where;\r\nAnd as I biheeld into the eest,--an heigh to the sonne,\r\nI seigh a tour on a toft,--trieliche y-maked,\r\nA deep dale bynethe--a dongeon thereinne\r\nWith depe diches and derke--and dredfulle of sighte.\r\nA fair feeld ful of folk--fond I ther bitwene,\r\nOf alle manere of men,--the meene and the riche,\r\nWerchynge and wandrynge--as the world asketh.\r\nSome putten hem to the plough,--pleiden ful selde,\r\nIn settynge and sowynge--swonken ful harde,\r\nAnd wonnen that wastours--with glotonye dystruyeth.\"[181]\r\n\r\n\r\nA gloomy picture of the world, like the frightful dreams which occur so\r\noften in Albert Durer and Luther. The first reformers were persuaded\r\nthat the earth was given over to evil; that the devil had on it his\r\nempire and his officers; that Antichrist, seated on the throne of Rome,\r\ndisplayed ecclesiastical pomps to seduce souls and cast them into the\r\nfire of hell. So here Anti-christ, with raised banner, enters a convent;\r\nbells are rung; monks in solemn procession go to meet him, and receive\r\nwith congratulations their lord and father.[182] With seven great\r\ngiants, the seven deadly sins, he besieges Conscience; and the assault\r\nis led by Idleness, who brings with her an army of more than a thousand\r\nprelates: for vices reign, more hateful from being in holy places, and\r\nemployed in the church of God in the devil's service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ac now is Religion a rydere--a romere aboute,\r\nA ledere of love-dayes--and a lond-buggere,\r\nA prikere on a palfrey--fro manere to manere....\r\nAnd but if his knave knele--that shal his coppe brynge,\r\nHe loureth on hym, and asketh hym--who taughte hym curteisie.\"[183]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this sacrilegious show has its day, and God puts His hand on men in\r\norder to warn them. By order of Conscience, Nature sends forth a host of\r\nplagues and diseases from the planets:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Kynde Conscience tho herde,--and cam out of the planetes,\r\nAnd sente forth his forreyours--feveres and fluxes,\r\nCoughes and cardiaclescrampes and tooth-aches,\r\nReumes and radegundes,--and roynous scabbes,\r\nBiles and bocches,--and brennynge agues,\r\nFrenesies and foule yveles,--forageres of kynde....\r\nThere was 'Harrow! and Help!--Here cometh Kynde!\r\nWith Deeth that is dredful--to undo us alle!'\r\nThe lord that lyved after lust--tho aloud cryde....\r\nDeeth cam dryvynge after,--and al to duste passhed\r\nKynges and knyghtes,--kaysers and popes,...\r\nManye a lovely lady--and lemmans of knyghtes,\r\nSwowned and swelted for sorwe of hise dyntes.\"[184]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a crowd of miseries, like those which Milton has described in\r\nhis vision of human life; tragic pictures and emotions, such as the\r\nreformers delight to dwell upon. There is a like speech delivered by\r\nJohn Knox, before the fair ladies of Mary Stuart, which tears the veil\r\nfrom the human corpse just as coarsely, in order to exhibit its shame.\r\nThe conception of the world, proper to the people of the north, all sad\r\nand moral, shows itself already. They are never comfortable in their\r\ncountry; they have to strive continually against cold or rain. They\r\ncannot live there carelessly, lying under a lovely sky, in a sultry and\r\nclear atmosphere, their eyes filled with the noble beauty and happy\r\nserenity of the land. They must work to live; be attentive, exact, keep\r\ntheir houses wind and water tight, trudge doggedly through the mud\r\nbehind their plough, light their lamps in their shops during the day.\r\nTheir climate imposes endless inconvenience, and exacts endless\r\nendurance. Hence arise melancholy and the idea of duty. Man naturally\r\nthinks of life as of a battle, oftener of black death which closes this\r\ndeadly show, and leads so many plumed and disorderly processions to the\r\nsilence and the eternity of the grave. All this visible world is vain;\r\nthere is nothing true but human virtue--the courageous energy with which\r\nman attains to self-command, the generous energy with which he employs\r\nhimself in the service of others. On this view, then, his eyes are\r\nfixed; they pierce through worldly gauds, neglect sensual joys, to\r\nattain this. By such inner thoughts and feelings the ideal model is\r\ndisplaced; a new source of action springs up--the idea of righteousness.\r\nWhat sets them against ecclesiastical pomp and insolence is neither the\r\nenvy of the poor and low, nor the anger of the oppressed, nor a\r\nrevolutionary desire to experimentalize abstract truth, but conscience.\r\nThey tremble lest they should not work out their salvation if they\r\ncontinue in a corrupt church; they fear the menaces of God, and dare not\r\nembark on the great journey with unsafe guides. \"What is righteousness?\"\r\nasked Luther, anxiously, \"and how shall I obtain it?\" With like anxiety\r\nPiers Plowman goes to seek Dowell, and asks each one to show him where\r\nhe shall find him. \"With us,\" say the friars. \"Contra quath ich,\r\n_Septies in die cadit justus_, and ho so syngeth certys doth nat wel;\"\r\nso he betakes himself to \"study and writing,\" like Luther; the clerks at\r\ntable speak much of God and of the Trinity, \"and taken Bernarde to\r\nwitnesse, and putteth forth presompcions... ac the carful mai crie and\r\nquaken atte gate, bothe a fyngred and a furst, and for defaute spille ys\r\nnon so hende to have hym yn. Clerkus and knyghtes carpen of God ofte,\r\nand haveth hym muche in hure mouthe, ac mene men in herte;\" and heart,\r\ninner faith, living virtue, are what constitute true religion. This is\r\nwhat these dull Saxons had begun to discover. The Teutonic conscience,\r\nand English good-sense, too, had been aroused, as well as individual\r\nenergy, the resolution to judge and decide alone, by and for one's self.\r\n\"Christ is our hede that sitteth on hie, Heddis ne ought we have no mo,\"\r\nsays a poem, attributed to Chaucer, and which, with others, claims\r\nindependence for Christian consciences.[185]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We ben his membres bothe also,\r\nFather he taught us call him all,\r\nMaisters to call forbad he tho;\r\nAl maisters ben wickid and fals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other mediator between man and God. In vain the doctors state that\r\nthey have authority for their words; there is a word of greater\r\nauthority, to wit, God's. We hear it in the fourteenth century, this\r\ngrand \"word of God.\" It quitted the learned schools, the dead languages,\r\nthe dusty shelves on which the clergy suffered it to sleep, covered with\r\na confusion of commentators and Fathers.[186] Wycliff appeared and\r\ntranslated it like Luther, and in a spirit similar to Luther's. \"Cristen\r\nmen and wymmen, olde and yonge, shulden studie fast in the Newe\r\nTestament, for it is of ful autorite, and opyn to undirstonding of\r\nsimple men, as to the poyntis that be moost nedeful to salvacioun.\"[187]\r\nReligion must be secular, in order to escape from the hands of the\r\nclergy, who monopolize it; each must hear and read for himself the word\r\nof God; he will then be sure that it has not been corrupted; he will\r\nfeel it better, and, more, he will understand it better, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ech place of holy writ, both opyn and derk, techit mekenes and charite;\r\nand therfore he that kepith mekenes and charite hath the trewe\r\nundirstondyng and perfectioun of al holi writ.... Therfore no simple man\r\nof wit be aferd unmesurabli to studie in the text of holy writ... and no\r\nclerk be proude of the verrey undirstondyng of holy writ, for whi\r\nundirstonding of hooly writ with outen charite that kepith Goddis\r\nheestis, makith a man depper dampned... and pride and covetise of\r\nclerkis is cause of her blindees and eresie, and priveth them fro verrey\r\nundirstondyng of holy writ.\"[188]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the memorable words that began to circulate in the markets and\r\nin the schools. They read the translated Bible, and commented on it;\r\nthey judged the existing Church after it. What judgments these serious\r\nand untainted minds passed upon it, with what readiness they pushed on\r\nto the true religion of their race, we may see from their petition to\r\nParliament.[189] One hundred and thirty years before Luther, they said\r\nthat the pope was not established by Christ, that pilgrimages and\r\nimage-worship were akin to idolatry, that external rites are of no\r\nimportance, that priests ought not to possess temporal wealth, that the\r\ndoctrine of transubstantiation made a people idolatrous, that priests\r\nhave not the power of absolving from sin. In proof of all this they\r\nbrought forward texts of Scripture. Fancy these brave spirits, simple\r\nand strong souls, who began to read at night in their shops, by\r\ncandle-light; for they were shopkeepers--tailors, skinners, and\r\nbakers--who, with some men of letters, began to read, and then to\r\nbelieve, and finally got themselves burned.[190] What a sight for the\r\nfifteenth century, and what a promise! It seems as though, with liberty\r\nof action, liberty of mind begins to appear; that these common folk will\r\nthink and speak; that under the conventional literature, imitated from\r\nFrance, a new literature is dawning; and that England, genuine England,\r\nhalf-mute since the Conquest, will at last find a voice.\r\n\r\nShe had not yet found it. King and peers ally themselves to the Church,\r\npass terrible statutes, destroy books, burn heretics alive, often with\r\nrefinement of torture--one in a barrel, another hung by an iron chain\r\naround his waist. The temporal wealth of the clergy had been attacked,\r\nand therewith the whole English constitution; and the great\r\nestablishment above crushed out with its whole weight the revolutionists\r\nfrom below. Darkly, in silence, while the nobles were destroying each\r\nother in the Wars of the Roses, the commons went on working and living,\r\nseparating themselves from the established Church, maintaining their\r\nliberties, amassing wealth, but not going further.[191] Like a vast rock\r\nwhich underlies the soil, yet crops up here and there at distant\r\nintervals, they barely show themselves. No great poetical or religious\r\nwork displays them to the light. They sang; but their ballads, first\r\nignored, then transformed, reach us only in a late edition. They prayed;\r\nbut beyond one or two indifferent poems, their incomplete and repressed\r\ndoctrine bore no fruit. We may well see from the verse, tone, and drift\r\nof their ballads that they are capable of the finest poetic\r\noriginality,[192] but their poetry is in the hands of yeomen and\r\nharpers. We perceive, by the precocity and energy of their religious\r\nprotests, that they are capable of the most severe and impassioned\r\ncreeds; but their faith remains hidden in the shop-parlors of a few\r\nobscure sectaries. Neither their faith nor their poetry has been able to\r\nattain its end or issue. The Renaissance and the Reformation, those two\r\nnational outbreaks, are still far off; and the literature of the period\r\nretains to the end, like the highest ranks of English society, almost\r\nthe perfect stamp of its French origin and its foreign models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: See, amidst other delineations of their manners,\r\nthe first accounts of the first Crusade. Godfrey clove a Saracen\r\ndown to his waist. In Palestine, a widow was compelled, up to the\r\nage of sixty, to marry again, because no fief could remain without\r\na defender. A Spanish leader said to his exhausted soldiers after\r\na battle, \"You are too weary and too much wounded, but come and\r\nfight with me against this other band; the fresh wounds which we\r\nshall receive will make us forget those which we have.\" At this\r\ntime, says the General Chronicle of Spain, kings, counts, and\r\nnobles, and all the knights, that they might be ever ready, kept\r\ntheir horses in the chamber where they slept with their wives.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: For difference in numbers of the fleet and men\r\nsee Freeman, \"History of the Norman Conquest,\" 3 vols., 1867,\r\nIII. 381, 387.--Tr.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: For all the details see \"Anglo-Norman Chronicles,\"\r\nIII. 4, as quoted by Aug.

He had walk for a hundred sheep, and my mother\r\nmilked thirty kine. He was able, and did find the king a harness, with\r\nhimself and his horse; while he came to the place that he should receive\r\nthe king's wages. I can remember that I buckled his harness when he went\r\nunto Blackheath field. He kept me to school, or else I had not been able\r\nto have preached before the King's Majesty now. He married my sisters\r\nwith £5 or 20 nobles a-piece, so that he brought them up in godliness\r\nand fear of God; he kept hospitality for his poor neighbours, and some\r\nalms he gave to the poor; and all this did he of the said farm. Where\r\nhe that now hath it payeth £16 by the year, or more, and is not able\r\nto do anything for his prince, for himself, nor for his children, or\r\ngive a cup of drink to the poor.\"\r\n\r\nThis is from the sixth sermon, preached before the young king, April\r\n12, 1549: \"In my time my poor father was as diligent to teach me to\r\nshoot as to learn (me) any other thing; and so, I think, other men did\r\ntheir children. He taught me how to draw, how to lay my body in my bow,\r\nand not to draw with strength of arms, as other nations do, but with\r\nstrength of the body. I had my bows bought me according to my age and\r\nstrength; as I increased in them, so my bows were made bigger and\r\nbigger; for men shall never shoot well except they be brought up\r\nin it.

Geoffrey Chaucer appeared, a man of mark,\r\ninventive though a disciple, original though a translator, who by his\r\ngenius, education, and life, was enabled to know and to depict a whole\r\nworld, but above all to satisfy the chivalric world and the splendid\r\ncourts which shone upon the heights.[193] He belonged to it, though\r\nlearned and versed in all branches of scholastic knowledge; and he took\r\nsuch a share in it that his life from beginning to end was that of a man\r\nof the world, and a man of action. We find him by turns in King Edward's\r\narmy, in the king's train, husband of a maid of honor to the queen, a\r\npensioner, a placeholder, a member of Parliament, a knight, founder of a\r\nfamily which was hereafter to become allied to royalty. Moreover, he was\r\nin the king's council, brother-in-law of John of Gaunt, employed more\r\nthan once in open embassies or secret missions at Florence, Genoa,\r\nMilan, Flanders, commissioner in France for the marriage of the Prince\r\nof Wales, high up and low down on the political ladder, disgraced,\r\nrestored to place. This experience of business, travel, war, and the\r\ncourt, was not like a book-education. He was at the Court of Edward III,\r\nthe most splendid in Europe, amidst tourneys, grand receptions,\r\nmagnificent displays; he took part in the pomps of France and Milan;\r\nconversed with Petrarch, perhaps with Boccaccio and Froissart; was actor\r\nin, and spectator of, the finest and most tragical of dramas. In these\r\nfew words, what ceremonies and cavalcades are implied! what processions\r\nin armor, what caparisoned horses, bedizened ladies! what display of\r\ngallant and lordly manners! what a varied and brilliant world, well\r\nsuited to occupy the mind and eyes of a poet! Like Froissart, and better\r\nthan he, Chaucer could depict the castles of the nobles, their\r\nconversations, their talk of love, and anything else that concerned\r\nthem, and please them by his portraiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--The Decline of the Middle Ages\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo notions raised the Middle Ages above the chaos of barbarism: one\r\nreligious, which had fashioned the gigantic cathedrals, and swept the\r\nmasses from their native soil to hurl them upon the Holy Land; the other\r\nsecular, which had built feudal fortresses, and set the man of courage\r\nerect and armed, within his own domain: the one had produced the\r\nadventurous hero, the other the mystical monk; the one, to wit, the\r\nbelief in God, the other the belief in self. Both, running to excess,\r\nhad degenerated by the violence of their own strength: the one had\r\nexalted independence into rebellion, the other had turned piety into\r\nenthusiasm: the first made man unfit for civil life, the second drew him\r\nback from natural life: the one, sanctioning disorder, dissolved\r\nsociety; the other, enthroning infatuation, perverted intelligence.\r\nChivalry had need to be repressed because it issued in brigandage;\r\ndevotion restrained because it induced slavery. Turbulent feudalism grew\r\nfeeble, like oppressive theocracy; and the two great master passions,\r\ndeprived of their sap and lopped of their stem, gave place by their\r\nweakness to the monotony of habit and the taste for worldliness, which\r\nshot forth in their stead and flourished under their name.\r\n\r\nGradually, the serious element declined, in books as in manners, in\r\nworks of art as in books. Architecture, instead of being the handmaid of\r\nfaith, became the slave of fantasy. It was exaggerated, became too\r\nornamental, sacrificing general effect to detail, shot up its steeples\r\nto unreasonable heights, decorated its churches with canopies,\r\npinnacles, trefoiled gables, open-work galleries. \"Its whole aim was\r\ncontinually to climb higher, to clothe the sacred edifice with a gaudy\r\nbedizenment, as if it were a bride on her wedding morning.\"[194] Before\r\nthis marvellous lacework, what emotion could one feel but a pleased\r\nastonishment? What becomes of Christian sentiment before such scenic\r\nornamentations? In like manner literature sets itself to play. In the\r\neighteenth century, the second age of absolute monarchy, we saw on one\r\nside finials and floriated cupolas, on the other pretty _vers de\r\nsocieté_, courtly and sprightly tales, taking the place of severe\r\nbeauty-lines and noble writings. Even so in the fourteenth century, the\r\nsecond age of feudalism, they had on one side the stone fretwork and\r\nslender efflorescence of aërial forms, and on the other finical verses\r\nand diverting stories, taking the place of the old grand architecture\r\nand the old simple literature. It is no longer the overflowing of a true\r\nsentiment which produces them, but the craving for excitement. Consider\r\nChaucer, his subjects, and how he selects them. He goes far and wide to\r\ndiscover them, to Italy, France, to the popular legends, the ancient\r\nclassics. His readers need diversity, and his business is to \"provide\r\nfine tales\": it was in those days the poet's business.[195] The lords at\r\ntable have finished dinner, the minstrels come and sing, the brightness\r\nof the torches falls on the velvet and ermine, on the fantastic figures,\r\nthe motley, the elaborate embroidery of their long garments; then the\r\npoet arrives, presents his manuscript, \"richly illuminated, bound in\r\ncrimson velvet, embellished with silver clasps and bosses, roses of\r\ngold\": they ask him what his subject is, and he answers \"Love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--The Poetry of Chaucer\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is the most agreeable subject, fittest to make the evening\r\nhours pass sweetly, amid the goblets filled with spiced wine and the\r\nburning perfumes. Chaucer translated first that great storehouse of\r\ngallantry, the \"Roman de la Rose.\" There is no pleasanter entertainment.\r\nIt is about a rose which the lover wished to pluck: the pictures of the\r\nMay months, the groves, the flowery earth, the green hedgerows, abound\r\nand display their bloom. Then come portraits of the smiling ladies,\r\nRichesse, Fraunchise, Gaiety, and by way of contrast, the sad\r\ncharacters, Daunger and Travail, all fully and minutely described, with\r\ndetail of features, clothing, attitude; they walk about, as on a piece\r\nof tapestry, amid landscapes, dances, castles, among allegorical groups,\r\nin lively sparkling colors, displayed, contrasted, ever renewed and\r\nvaried so as to entertain the sight. For an evil has arisen, unknown to\r\nserious ages--_ennui_; novelty and brilliancy followed by novelty and\r\nbrilliancy are necessary to withstand it; and Chaucer, like Boccaccio\r\nand Froissart, enters into the struggle with all his heart. He borrows\r\nfrom Boccaccio his history of Palamon and Arcite, from Lollius his\r\nhistory of Troilus and Cressida, and rearranges them. How the two young\r\nTheban knights, Arcite and Palamon, both fall in love with the beautiful\r\nEmily, and how Arcite, victorious in tourney, falls and dies,\r\nbequeathing Emily to his rival; how the fine Trojan knight Troilus wins\r\nthe favor of Cressida, and how Cressida abandons him for Diomedes--these\r\nare still tales in verse, tales of love. A little tedious they may be;\r\nall the writings of this age, French, or imitated from French, are born\r\nof too prodigal minds; but how they glide along! A winding stream, which\r\nflows smoothly on level sand, and sparkles now and again in the sun, is\r\nthe only image we can compare it to. The characters speak too much, but\r\nthen they speak so well! Even when they dispute we like to listen, their\r\nanger and offences are so wholly based on a happy overflow of unbroken\r\nconverse. Remember Froissart, how slaughters, assassinations, plagues,\r\nthe butcheries of the Jacquerie, the whole chaos of human misery,\r\ndisappears in his fine ceaseless humor, so that the furious and grinning\r\nfigures seem but ornaments and choice embroideries to relieve the skein\r\nof shaded and colored silk which forms the groundwork of his narrative!\r\nbut, in particular, a multitude of descriptions spread their gilding\r\nover all. Chaucer leads you among arms, palaces, temples, and halts\r\nbefore each beautiful thing. Here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The statue of Venus glorious for to see\r\nWas naked fleting in the large see,\r\nAnd fro the navel doun all covered was\r\nWith wawes grene, and bright as any glas.\r\nA citole in hire right hand hadde she,\r\nAnd on hire hed, ful semely for to see,\r\nA rose gerlond fressh, and wel smelling,\r\nAbove hire hed hire doves fleckering.\"[196]\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther on, the temple of Mars:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"First on the wall was peinted a forest,\r\nIn which ther wonneth neyther man ne best,\r\nWith knotty knarry barrein trees old\r\nOf stubbes sharpe and hidous to behold;\r\nIn which ther ran a romble and a swough\r\nAs though a storme shuld bresten every bough:\r\nAnd dounward from an hill under a bent.\r\nTher stood the temple of Mars armipotent,\r\nWrought all of burned stele, of which th' entree\r\nWas longe and streite, and gastly for to see.\r\nAud therout came a rage and swiche a vise,\r\nThat it made all the gates for to rise.\r\nThe northern light in at the dore shone,\r\nFor window on the wall ne was ther none,\r\nThurgh which men mighten any light discerne.\r\nThe dore was all of athamant eterne,\r\nYclenched overthwart and endelong\r\nWith yren tough, and for to make it strong,\r\nEvery piler the temple to sustene\r\nWas tonne-gret, of yren bright and shene.\"[197]\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere on the wall were representations of slaughter; and in the\r\nsanctuary\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The statue of Mars upon a carte stood\r\nArmed, and loked grim as he were wood,...\r\nA wolf ther stood beforne him at his fete\r\nWith eyen red, and of a man he ete.\"[198]\r\n\r\n\r\nAre not these contrasts well designed to rouse the imagination? You will\r\nmeet in Chaucer a succession of similar pictures. Observe the train of\r\ncombatants who come to joust in the tilting field for Arcite and\r\nPalamon:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With him ther wenten knightes many on.\r\nSom wol ben armed in an habergeon\r\nAnd in a brestplate, and in a gipon;\r\nAnd som wol have a pair of plates large;\r\nAnd som wol have a Pruce sheld, or a targe,\r\nSom wol ben armed on his legges wele,\r\nAnd have an axe, and som a mace of stele....\r\nTher maist thou se coming with Palamon\r\nLicurge himself, the grete king of Trace:\r\nBlake was his berd, and manly was his face.\r\nThe cercles of his eyen in his hed\r\nThey gloweden betwixen yelwe and red,\r\nAnd like a griffon loked he about,\r\nWith kemped heres on his browes stout;\r\nHis limmes gret, his braunes hard and stronge,\r\nHis shouldres brode, his armes round and longe.\r\nAnd as the guise was in his contree,\r\nFul highe upon a char of gold stood he,\r\nWith foure white bolles in the trais.\r\nInstede of cote-armure on his harnais,\r\nWith nayles yelwe, and bright as any gold,\r\nHe hadde a beres skin, cole-blake for old.\r\nHis longe here was kempt behind his bak,\r\nAs any ravenes fether it shone for blake.\r\nA wreth of gold arm-gret, of huge weight,\r\nUpon his hed sate ful of stones bright,\r\nOf fine rubins and of diamants.\r\nAbout his char ther wenten white alauns,\r\nTwenty and mo, as gret as any stere,\r\nTo hunten at the leon or the dere,\r\nAnd folwed him, with mosel fast ybound,\r\nColered with gold, and torettes filed round.\r\nAn hundred lordes had he in his route,\r\nArmed ful wel, with hertes sterne and stoute.\r\nWith Arcita, in stories as men find,\r\nThe gret Emetrius the king of Inde,\r\nUpon a stede bay, trapped in stele,\r\nCovered with cloth of gold diapred wele,\r\nCame riding like the god of armes Mars.\r\nHis cote-armure was of a cloth of Tars,\r\nCouched with perles, white, and round and grete.\r\nHis sadel was of brent gold new ybete;\r\nA mantelet upon his shouldres hanging\r\nBret-ful of rubies red, as fire sparkling.\r\nHis crispe here like ringes was yronne,\r\nAnd that was yelwe, and glitered as the sonne.\r\nHis nose was high, his eyen bright citrin,\r\nHis lippes round, his color was sanguin....\r\nAnd as a leon he his loking caste.\r\nOf five and twenty yere his age I caste.\r\nHis berd was well begonnen for to spring;\r\nHis vois was a trompe thondering.\r\nUpon his hed he wered of laurer grene\r\nA gerlond fresshe and lusty for to sene.\r\nUpon his hond he bare for his deduit\r\nAn egle tame, as any lily whit.\r\nAn hundred lordes had he with him there,\r\nAll armed save hir hedes in all hir gere,\r\nFul richely in alle manere things....\r\nAbout this king ther ran on every part\r\nFul many a tame leon and leopart.\"[199]\r\n\r\n\r\nA herald would not describe them better nor more fully. The lords and\r\nladies of the time would recognize here their tourneys and masquerades.\r\n\r\nThere is something more pleasant than a fine narrative, and that is a\r\ncollection of fine narratives, especially when the narratives are all of\r\ndifferent colorings. Froissart gives us such under the name of\r\nChronicles; Boccaccio still better; after him the lords of the _Cent\r\nNouvelles Nouvelles_; and, later still, Marguerite of Navarre. What more\r\nnatural among people who meet, talk and wish to amuse themselves? The\r\nmanners of the time suggest them; for the habits and tastes of society\r\nhad begun, and fiction thus conceived only brings into books the\r\nconversations which are heard in the hall and by the wayside. Chaucer\r\ndescribes a troop of pilgrims, people of every rank, who are going to\r\nCanterbury; a knight, a sergeant of law, an Oxford clerk, a doctor, a\r\nmiller, a prioress, a monk, who agree to tell a story all round:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For trewely comfort ne mirthe is non,\r\nTo riden by the way domb as the ston.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey tell their stories accordingly; and on this slender and flexible\r\nthread all the jewels of feudal imagination, real or false, contribute\r\none after another their motley shapes to form a necklace, side by side\r\nwith noble and chivalrous stories: we have the miracle of an infant\r\nwhose throat was cut by Jews, the trials of patient Griselda, Canace and\r\nmarvellous fictions of Oriental fancy, obscene stories of marriage and\r\nmonks, allegorical or moral tales, the fable of the cock and hen, a list\r\nof great unfortunate persons: Lucifer, Adam, Samson, Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nZenobia, Crœsus, Ugolino, Peter of Spain. I leave out some, for I must\r\nbe brief. Chaucer is like a jeweller with his hands full: pearls and\r\nglass beads, sparkling diamonds and common agates, black jet and ruby\r\nroses, all that history and imagination had been able to gather and\r\nfashion during three centuries in the East, in France, in Wales, in\r\nProvence, in Italy, all that had rolled his way, clashed together,\r\nbroken or polished by the stream of centuries, and by the great jumble\r\nof human memory, he holds in his hand, arranges it, composes therefrom a\r\nlong sparkling ornament, with twenty pendants, a thousand facets, which\r\nby its splendor, variety, contrasts, may attract and satisfy the eyes of\r\nthose most greedy for amusement and novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOFFREY CHAUCER.\r\n_Photogravure from an old engraving._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe does more. The universal outburst of unchecked curiosity demands a\r\nmore refined enjoyment: reverie and fantasy alone can satisfy it; not\r\nprofound and thoughtful fantasy as we find it in Shakespeare, nor\r\nimpassioned and meditative reverie as we find it in Dante, but the\r\nreverie and fantasy of the eyes, ears, external senses, which in poetry\r\nas in architecture call for singularity, wonders, accepted challenges,\r\nvictories gained over the rational and probable, and which are satisfied\r\nonly by what is crowded and dazzling. When we look at a cathedral of\r\nthat time, we feel a sort of fear. Substance is wanting; the walls are\r\nhollowed out to make room for windows, the elaborate work of the\r\nporches, the wonderful growth of the slender columns, the thin curvature\r\nof arches--everything seems to menace us; support has been withdrawn to\r\ngive way to ornament. Without external prop or buttress, and artificial\r\naid of iron clamp-work, the building would have crumbled to pieces on\r\nthe first day; as it is, it undoes itself; we have to maintain on the\r\nspot a colony of masons continually to ward off the continual decay. But\r\nour sight grows dim in following the wavings and twistings of the\r\nendless fretwork; the dazzling rose-window of the portal and the painted\r\nglass throw a checkered light on the carved stalls of the choir, the\r\ngold-work of the altar, the long array of damascened and glittering\r\ncopes, the crowd of statues, tier above tier; and amid this violet\r\nlight, this quivering purple, amid these arrows of gold which pierce the\r\ngloom, the entire building is like the tail of a mystical peacock. So\r\nmost of the poems of the time are barren of foundation; at most a trite\r\nmorality serves them for mainstay: in short, the poet thought of nothing\r\nelse than displaying before us a glow of colors and a jumble of forms.\r\nThey are dreams or visions; there are five or six in Chaucer, and you\r\nwill meet more on your advance to the Renaissance. But the show is\r\nsplendid. Chaucer is transported in a dream to a temple of glass,[200]\r\non the walls of which are figured in gold all the legends of Ovid and\r\nVergil, an infinite train of characters and dresses, like that which, on\r\nthe painted glass in the churches, occupied then the gaze of the\r\nfaithful. Suddenly a golden eagle, which soars near the sun, and\r\nglitters like a carbuncle, descends with the swiftness of lightning, and\r\ncarries him off in his talons above the stars, dropping him at last\r\nbefore the House of Fame, splendidly built of beryl, with shining\r\nwindows and lofty turrets, and situated on a high rock of almost\r\ninaccessible ice. All the southern side was graven with the names of\r\nfamous men, but the sun was continuously melting them. On the northern\r\nside, the names, better protected, still remained. On the turrets\r\nappeared the minstrels and \"gestiours,\" with Orpheus, Arion, and the\r\ngreat harpers, and behind them myriads of musicians, with horns, flutes,\r\nbagpipes, and reeds, on which they played, and which filled the air;\r\nthen all the charmers, magicians, and prophets. He enters, and in a high\r\nhall, plated with gold, embossed with pearls, on a throne of carbuncle,\r\nhe sees a woman seated, a \"noble quene,\" amidst an infinite number of\r\nheralds, whose embroidered cloaks bore the arms of the most famous\r\nknights in the world, and heard the sounds of instruments, and the\r\ncelestial melody of Calliope and her sisters. From her throne to the\r\ngate was a row of pillars, on which stood the great historians and\r\npoets; Josephus on a pillar of lead and iron; Statius on a pillar of\r\niron stained with tiger's blood; Ovid, \"Venus's clerk,\" on a pillar of\r\ncopper; then, on one higher than the rest, Homer and Livy, Dares the\r\nPhrygian, Guido Colonna, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the other historians\r\nof the war of Troy. Must I go on copying this phantasmagoria, in which\r\nconfused erudition mars picturesque invention, and frequent banter shows\r\nsigns that the vision is only a planned amusement? The poet and his\r\nreader have imagined for half-an-hour decorated halls and bustling\r\ncrowds; a slender thread of common-sense has ingeniously crept along the\r\ntransparent golden mist which they amuse themselves with following. That\r\nsuffices; they are pleased with their fleeting fancies, and ask no more.\r\n\r\nAmid this exuberancy of mind, amid these refined cravings, and this\r\ninsatiate exaltation of imagination and the senses, there was one\r\npassion, that of love, which, combining all, was developed in excess,\r\nand displayed in miniature the sickly charm, the fundamental and fatal\r\nexaggeration, which are the characteristics of the age, and which,\r\nlater, the Spanish civilization exhibits both in its flower and its\r\ndecay. Long ago, the courts of love in Provence had established the\r\ntheory. \"Each one who loves,\" they said, \"grows pale at the sight of her\r\nwhom he loves; each action of the lover ends in the thought of her whom\r\nhe loves. Love can refuse nothing to love.\"[201] This search after\r\nexcessive sensation had ended in the ecstasies and transports of Guido\r\nCavalcanti, and of Dante; and in Languedoc a company of enthusiasts had\r\nestablished themselves, love-penitents, who, in order to prove the\r\nviolence of their passion, dressed in summer in furs and heavy garments,\r\nand in winter in light gauze, and walked thus about the country, so that\r\nseveral of them fell ill and died. Chaucer, in their wake, explained in\r\nhis verses the craft of love,[202] the Ten Commandments, the twenty\r\nstatutes of love; and praised his lady, his \"daieseye,\" his \"Margarite,\"\r\nhis \"vermeil rose\"; depicted love in ballads, visions, allegories,\r\ndidactic poems, in a hundred guises. This is chivalrous, lofty love, as\r\nit was conceived in the Middle Ages; above all, tender love. Troilus\r\nloves Cressida like a troubadour; without Pandarus, her uncle, he would\r\nhave languished, and ended by dying in silence. He will not reveal the\r\nname of her he loves. Pandarus has to tear it from him, perform all the\r\nbold actions himself, plan every kind of stratagem. Troilus, however,\r\nbrave and strong in battle, can but weep before Cressida, ask her\r\npardon, and faint. Cressida, on her side, has every delicate feeling.\r\nWhen Pandarus brings her Troilus's first letter, she begins by refusing\r\nit, and is ashamed to open it: she opens it only because she is told the\r\npoor knight is about to die. At the first words \"all rosy hewed tho woxe\r\nshe\"; and though the letter is respectful, she will not answer it. She\r\nyields at last to the importunities of her uncle, and answers Troilus\r\nthat she will feel for him the affection of a sister. As to Troilus, he\r\ntrembles all over, grows pale when he sees the messenger return, doubts\r\nhis happiness, and will not believe the assurance which is given him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But right so as these holtes and these hayis\r\nThat han in winter dead ben and dry,\r\nRevesten hem in grene, whan that May is....\r\nRight in that selfe wise, sooth for to sey,\r\nWoxe suddainly his herte full of joy.\"[203]\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly, after many troubles, and thanks to the efforts of Pandarus, he\r\nobtains her confession; and in this confession what a delightful charm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And as the newe abashed nightingale,\r\nThat stinteth first, whan she beginneth sing,\r\nWhan that she heareth any heerdes tale,\r\nOr in the hedges any wight stearing,\r\nAnd after siker doeth her voice outring:\r\nRight so Creseide, whan that her drede stent,\r\nOpened her herte and told him her entent.\"[204]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe, as soon as he perceived a hope from afar,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In chaunged voice, right for his very drede,\r\nWhich voice eke quoke, and thereto his manere,\r\nGoodly abasht, and now his hewes rede,\r\nNow pale, unto Cresseide his ladie dere,\r\nWith looke doun cast, and humble iyolden chere,\r\nLo, the alderfirst word that him astart\r\nWas twice: 'Mercy, mercy, O my sweet herte!'\"[205]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ardent love breaks out in impassioned accents, in bursts of\r\nhappiness. Far from being regarded as a fault, it is the source of all\r\nvirtue. Troilus becomes braver, more generous, more upright, through it;\r\nhis speech runs now on love and virtue; he scorns all villany; he honors\r\nthose who possess merit, succors those who are in distress; and\r\nCressida, delighted, repeats all day, with exceeding liveliness, this\r\nsong, which is like the warbling of a nightingale:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whom should I thanken but you, god of love,\r\nOf all this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne?\r\nAnd thanked be ye, lorde for that I love,\r\nThis is the right life that I am inne,\r\nTo flemen all maner vice and sinne:\r\nThis doeth me so to vertue for to entende\r\nThat daie by daie I in my will amende.\r\nAnd who that saieth that for to love is vice,...\r\nHe either is envious, or right nice,\r\nOr is unmightie for his shreudnesse\r\nTo loven....\r\nBut I with all mine herte and all my might,\r\nAs I have saied, woll love unto my last,\r\nMy owne dere herte, and all mine owne knight,\r\nIn whiche mine herte growen is so fast,\r\nAnd his in me, that it shall ever last.\"[206]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut misfortune comes. Her father Calchas demands her back, and the\r\nTrojans decide that they will give her up in exchange for prisoners. At\r\nthis news she swoons, and Troilus is about to slay himself. Their love\r\nat this time seems imperishable; it sports with death, because it\r\nconstitutes the whole of life. Beyond that better and delicious life\r\nwhich it created, it seems there can be no other:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But as God would, of swough she abraide,\r\nAnd gan to sighe, and Troilus she cride,\r\nAnd he answerde: 'Lady mine, Creseide,\r\nLive ye yet?' and let his swerde doun glide:\r\n'Ye herte mine, that thanked be Cupide,'\r\n(Quod she), and therwithal she sore sight,\r\nAnd he began to glade her as he might.\r\n\r\n\"Took her in armes two and kist her oft,\r\nAnd her to glad, he did al his entent,\r\nFor which her gost, that flikered aie a loft,\r\nInto her wofull herte ayen it went:\r\nBut at the last, as that her eye glent\r\nAside, anon she gan his sworde aspie,\r\nAs it lay bare, and gan for feare crie.\r\n\r\n\"And asked him why had he it out draw,\r\nAnd Troilus anon the cause her told,\r\nAnd how himself therwith he wold have slain,\r\nFor which Creseide upon him gan behold,\r\nAnd gan him in her armes faste fold,\r\nAnd said: 'O mercy God, lo which a dede!\r\nAlas, how nigh we weren bothe dede!'\"[207]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last they are separated, with what vows and what tears! and Troilus,\r\nalone in his chamber, murmurs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Where is mine owne lady lefe and dere?\r\nWhere is her white brest, where is it, where?\r\nWhere been her armes, and her eyen clere\r\nThat yesterday this time with me were?'...\r\nNor there nas houre in al the day or night,\r\nWhan he was ther as no man might him here,\r\nThat he ne sayd: 'O lovesome lady bright,\r\nHow have ye faren sins that ye were there?\r\nWelcome ywis mine owne lady dere!'...\r\nFro thence-forth he rideth up and doune,\r\nAnd every thing came him to remembraunce,\r\nAs he rode forth by the places of the toune,\r\nIn which he whilom had all his pleasaunce:\r\n'Lo, yonder saw I mine owne lady daunce,\r\nAnd in that temple with her eien clere,\r\nMe caught first my right lady dere.\r\nAnd yonder have I herde full lustely\r\nMy dere herte laugh, and yonder play\r\nSaw her ones eke ful blisfully,\r\nAnd yonder ones to me gan she say,\r\n\"Now, good sweete, love me well I pray.\"\r\nAnd yonde so goodly gan she me behold,\r\nThat to the death mine herte is to her hold,\r\nAnd at the corner in the yonder house\r\nHerde I mine alderlevest lady dere,\r\nSo womanly, with voice melodiouse,\r\nSingen so wel, so goodly, and so clere,\r\nThat in my soule yet me thinketh I here\r\nThe blissful sowne, and in that yonder place,\r\nMy lady first me toke unto her grace.'\"[208]\r\n\r\n\r\nNone has since found more true and tender words. These are the charming\r\n\"poetic branches\" which flourished amid gross ignorance and pompous\r\nparades. Human intelligence in the Middle Age had blossomed on that side\r\nwhere it perceived the light.\r\n\r\nBut mere narrative does not suffice to express his felicity and fancy;\r\nthe poet must go where \"shoures sweet of rain descended soft.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And every plaine was clothed faire\r\nWith new greene, and maketh small floures\r\nTo springen here and there in field and in mede,\r\nSo very good and wholsome be the shoures,\r\nThat it renueth that was old and dede,\r\nIn winter time; and out of every sede\r\nSpringeth the hearbe, so that every wight\r\nOf this season wexeth glad and light....\r\nIn which (grove) were okes great, streight as a line,\r\nUnder, the which the grasse so fresh of hew\r\nWas newly sprong, and an eight foot or nine\r\nEvery tree well fro his fellow grew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe must forget himself in the vague felicity of the country, and, like\r\nDante, lose himself in ideal light and allegory. The dreams love, to\r\ncontinue true, must not take too visible a form, nor enter into a too\r\nconsecutive history; they must float in a misty distance; the soul in\r\nwhich they hover can no longer think of the laws of existence; it\r\ninhabits another world; it forgets itself in the ravishing emotion which\r\ntroubles it, and sees its well-loved visions rise, mingle, come and go,\r\nas in summer we see the bees on a hill-slope flutter in a haze of light,\r\nand circle round and round the flowers.\r\n\r\n\"One morning,\"[209] a lady sings, \"at the dawn of day, I entered an\r\noak-grove\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With branches brode, laden with leves new,\r\nThat sprongen out ayen the sunne-shene,\r\nSome very red, and some a glad light grenc....[210]\r\n\r\n\"And I, that all this pleasaunt sight sie,\r\nThought sodainly I felt so sweet and aire\r\nOf the eglentere, that certainely\r\nThere is no hert, I deme, in such dispaire,\r\nNe with thoughts froward and contraire,\r\nSo overlaid, but it should soone have bote,\r\nIf it had ones felt this savour sote.\r\n\r\n\"And as I stood, and cast aside mine eie,\r\nI was ware of the fairest medler tree\r\nThat ever yet in all my life I sie,\r\nAs full of blossomes as it might be;\r\nTherein a goldfinch leaping pretile\r\nFro bough to bough; and, as him list, he eet\r\nHere and there of buds and floures sweet....\r\n\r\n\"And as I sat, the birds harkening thus,\r\nMethought that I heard voices sodainly,\r\nThe most sweetest and most delicious\r\nThat ever any wight, I trow truly,\r\nHeard in their life, for the armony\r\nAnd sweet accord was in so good musike,\r\nThat the voice to angels most was like.\"[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen she sees arrive \"a world of ladies... in surcotes white of\r\nvelvet... set with emerauds... as of great pearles round and orient, and\r\ndiamonds fine and rubies red.\" And all had on their head \"a rich fret of\r\ngold... full of stately riche stones set,\" with \"a chapelet of branches\r\nfresh and grene... some of laurer, some of woodbind, some of agnus\r\ncastus\"; and at the same time came a train of valiant knights in\r\nsplendid array, with harness of red gold, shining in the sun, and noble\r\nsteeds, with trappings \"of cloth of gold, and furred with ermine.\" These\r\nknights and ladies were the servants of the Leaf, and they sate under a\r\ngreat oak, at the feet of their queen.\r\n\r\nFrom the other side came a bevy of ladies as resplendent as the first,\r\nbut crowned with fresh flowers. These were the servants of the Flower.\r\nThey alighted, and began to dance in the meadow. But heavy clouds\r\nappeared in the sky, and a storm broke out. They wished to shelter\r\nthemselves under the oak, but there was no more room; they ensconced\r\nthemselves as they could in the hedges and among the brushwood; the rain\r\ncame down and spoiled their garlands, stained their robes, and washed\r\naway their ornaments; when the sun returned, they went to ask succor\r\nfrom the queen of the Leaf; she, being merciful, consoled them, repaired\r\nthe injury of the rain, and restored their original beauty. Then all\r\ndisappears as in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe lady was astonished, when suddenly a fair dame appeared and\r\ninstructed her. She learned that the servants of the Leaf had lived like\r\nbrave knights, and those of the Flower had loved idleness and pleasure.\r\nShe promises to serve the Leaf, and came away.\r\n\r\nIs this an allegory? There is at least a lack of wit. There is no\r\ningenious enigma; it is dominated by fancy, and the poet thinks only of\r\ndisplaying in quiet verse the fleeting and brilliant train which had\r\namused his mind, and charmed his eyes.\r\n\r\nChaucer himself, on the first of May, rises and goes out into the\r\nmeadows. Love enters his heart with the balmy air; the landscape is\r\ntransfigured, and the birds begin to speak:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There sate I downe among the faire flours,\r\nAnd saw the birds trip out of hir bours,\r\nThere as they rested them all the night,\r\nThey were so joyfull of the dayes light,\r\nThey began of May for to done honours.\r\n\r\n\"They coud that service all by rote,\r\nThere was many a lovely note,\r\nSome song loud as they had plained,\r\nAnd some in other manner voice yfained\r\nAnd some all out with the ful throte.\r\n\r\n\"The proyned hem and made hem right gay,\r\nAnd daunceden, and lepten on her spray,\r\nAnd evermore two and two in fere,\r\nRight so as they had chosen hem to yere,\r\nIn Feverere upon saint Valentines day.\r\n\r\n\"And the river that I sate upon,\r\nIt made such a noise as it ron,\r\nAccordaunt with the birdes armony,\r\nMethought it was the best melody\r\nThat might ben yheard of any mon.\"[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis confused harmony of vague noises troubles the sense; a secret\r\nlanguor enters the soul. The cuckoo throws his monotonous voice like a\r\nmournful and tender sigh between the white ash-tree boles; the\r\nnightingale makes his triumphant notes roll and ring above the leafy\r\ncanopy; fancy breaks in unsought, and Chaucer hears them dispute of\r\nLove. They sing alternately an antistrophic song, and the nightingale\r\nweeps for vexation to hear the cuckoo speak in depreciation of Love. He\r\nis consoled, however, by the poet's voice, seeing that he also suffers\r\nwith him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'For love and it hath doe me much wo.'\r\n'Ye use' (quod she) 'this medicine\r\nEvery day this May or thou dine\r\nGo looke upon the fresh daisie,\r\nAnd though thou be for wo in point to die,\r\nThat shall full greatly lessen thee of thy pine.\r\n\r\n\"'And looke alway that thou be good and trew,\r\nAnd I wol sing one of the songes new,\r\nFor love of thee, as loud as I may crie:'\r\nAnd than she began this song full hie,\r\n'I shrewe all hem that been of love untrue.'\"[213]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo such exquisite delicacies love, as with Petrarch, had carried poetry;\r\nby refinement even, as with Petrarch, it is lost now and then in its\r\nwit, conceits, clinches. But a marked characteristic at once separates\r\nit from Petrarch. If over-excited, it is also graceful, polished, full\r\nof archness, banter, fine sensual gayety, somewhat gossipy, as the\r\nFrench always paint love. Chaucer follows his true masters, and is\r\nhimself an elegant speaker, facile, ever ready to smile, loving choice\r\npleasures, a disciple of the \"Roman de la Rose,\" and much less Italian\r\nthan French.[214] The bent of French character makes of love not a\r\npassion, but a gay banquet, tastefully arranged, in which the service is\r\nelegant, the food exquisite, the silver brilliant, the two guests in\r\nfull dress, in good humor, quick to anticipate and please each other,\r\nknowing how to keep up the gayety, and when to part. In Chaucer, without\r\ndoubt, this other altogether worldly vein runs side by side with the\r\nsentimental element. If Troilus is a weeping lover, Pandarus is a lively\r\nrascal, who volunteers for a singular service with amusing urgency,\r\nfrank immorality, and carries it out carefully, gratuitously,\r\nthoroughly. In these pretty attempts Chaucer accompanies him as far as\r\npossible, and is not shocked. On the contrary, he makes fun out of it.\r\nAt the critical moment, with transparent hypocrisy, he shelters himself\r\nbehind his \"author.\" If you find the particulars free, he says, it is\r\nnot my fault; \"so writen clerks in hir bokes old,\" and \"I mote, aftir\r\nmin auctour, telle....\" Not only is he gay, but he jests throughout the\r\nwhole tale. He sees clearly through the tricks of feminine modesty; he\r\nlaughs at it archly, knowing full well what is behind; he seems to be\r\nsaying, finger on lip: \"Hush! let the grand words roll on, you will be\r\nedified presently.\" We are, in fact, edified; so is he, and in the nick\r\nof time he goes away, carrying the light: \"For ought I can aspies, this\r\nlight nor I ne serven here of nought. Troilus,\" says uncle Pandarus,\r\n\"if ye be wise, sweveneth not now, lest more folke arise.\" Troilus takes\r\ncare not to swoon; and Cressida at last, being alone with him, speaks\r\nwittily and with prudent delicacy; there is here an exceeding charm, no\r\ncoarseness. Their happiness covers all, even voluptuousness, with a\r\nprofusion and perfume of its heavenly roses. At most a slight spice of\r\narchness flavors it: \"and gode thrift he had full oft.\" Troilus holds\r\nhis mistress in his arms: \"with worse hap God let us never mete.\" The\r\npoet is almost as well pleased as they: for him, as for the men of his\r\ntime, the sovereign good is love, not damped, but satisfied; they ended\r\neven by thinking such love a merit. The ladies declared in their\r\njudgments, that when people love, they can refuse nothing to the\r\nbeloved. Love has become law; it is inscribed in a code; they combine it\r\nwith religion; and there is a sacrament of love, in which the birds in\r\ntheir anthems sing matins.[215] Chaucer curses with all his heart the\r\ncovetous wretches, the business men, who treat is as a madness:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As would God, tho wretches that despise\r\nService of love had eares al so long\r\nAs had Mida, ful of covetise,...\r\nTo teachen hem, that they been in the vice\r\nAnd lovers not, although they hold hem nice,\r\n... God yeve hem mischaunce,\r\nAnd every lover in his trouth avaunce.\"[216]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe clearly lacks severity, so rare in southern literature. The Italians\r\nin the Middle Ages made a virtue of joy; and you perceive that the world\r\nof chivalry, as conceived by the French, expanded morality so as to\r\nconfound it with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Characteristics of the Canterbury Tales\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other characteristics still more gay. The true Gallic\r\nliterature crops up; obscene tales, practical jokes on one's neighbor,\r\nnot shrouded in the Ciceronian style of Boccaccio, but related lightly\r\nby a man in good humor;[217] above all, active roguery, the trick of\r\nlaughing at your neighbor's expense. Chaucer displays it better than\r\nRutebeuf, and sometimes better than La Fontaine. He does not knock his\r\nmen down; he pricks them as he passes, not from deep hatred or\r\nindignation, but through sheer nimbleness of disposition, and quick\r\nsense of the ridiculous; he throws his gibes at them by handfuls. His\r\nman of law is more a man of business than of the world:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No wher so besy a man as he ther n'as,\r\nAnd yet he semed besier than he was.\"[218]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis three burgesses:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Everich, for the wisdom that he can\r\nWas shapelich for to ben an alderman.\r\nFor catel hadden they ynough and rent,\r\nAnd eke hir wives wolde it wel assent.\"[219]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the mendicant Friar he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His wallet lay beforne him in his lappe,\r\nBret-ful of pardon come from Rome al hote.\"[220]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mockery here comes from the heart, in the French manner, without\r\neffort, calculation, or vehemence. It is so pleasant and so natural to\r\nbanter one's neighbor! Sometimes the lively vein becomes so copious that\r\nit furnishes an entire comedy, indelicate certainly, but so free and\r\nlife-like! Here is the portrait of the Wife of Bath, who has buried five\r\nhusbands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bold was hire face, and fayre and rede of hew,\r\nShe was a worthy woman all hire live;\r\nHousbondes at the chirche dore had she had five,\r\nWithouten other compagnie in youthe....\r\nIn all the parish wif ne was ther non,\r\nThat to the offring before hire shulde gon,\r\nAnd if ther did, certain so wroth was she.\r\nThat she was out of alle charitee.\"[221]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a tongue she has! Impertinent, full of vanity, bold, chattering,\r\nunbridled, she silences everybody, and holds forth for an hour before\r\ncoming to her tale. We hear her grating, high-pitched, loud, clear\r\nvoice, wherewith she deafened her husbands. She continually harps upon\r\nthe same ideas, repeats her reasons, piles them up and confounds them,\r\nlike a stubborn mule who runs along shaking and ringing his bells, so\r\nthat the stunned listeners remain open-mouthed, wondering that a single\r\ntongue can spin out so many words. The subject was worth the trouble.\r\nShe proves that she did well to marry five husbands, and she proves it\r\nclearly, like a woman who knew it, because she had tried it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"God bad us for to wex and multiplie;\r\nThat gentil text can I wel understond;\r\nEke wel I wot, he sayd, that min husbond\r\nShuld leve fader and moder, and take to me;\r\nBut of no noumbre mention made he,\r\nOf bigamie or of octogamie;\r\nWhy shuld men than speke of it vilanie?\r\nLo here the wise king dan Solomon,\r\nI trow he hadde wives mo than on,\r\n(As wolde God it leful were to me\r\nTo be refreshed half so oft as he,)\r\nWhich a gift of God had he for alle his wives?...\r\nBlessed be God that I have wedded five.\r\nWelcome the sixthe whan that ever he shall....\r\nHe (Christ) spake to hem that wold live parfitly,\r\nAnd lordings (by your leve), that am nat I;\r\nI wol bestow the flour of all myn age\r\nIn th' actes and the fruit of mariage....\r\nAn husbond wol I have, I wol not lette,\r\nWhich shal be both my dettour and my thrall,\r\nAnd have his tribulation withall\r\nUpon his flesh, while that I am his wif.\"[222]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Chaucer has the freedom of Molière, and we possess it no longer.\r\nHis good wife justifies marriage in terms just as technical as\r\nSganarelle. It behooves us to turn the pages quickly, and follow in the\r\nlump only this Odyssey of marriages. The experienced wife, who has\r\njourneyed through life with five husbands, knows the art of taming them,\r\nand relates how she persecuted them with jealousy, suspicion, grumbling,\r\nquarrels, blows given and received; how the husband, checkmated by the\r\ncontinuity of the tempest, stooped at last, accepted the halter, and\r\nturned the domestic mill like a conjugal and resigned ass:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For as an hors, I coude bite and whine;\r\nI coude plain, and I was in the gilt....\r\nI plained first, so was our werre ystint.\r\nThey were ful glad to excusen hem ful blive\r\nOf thing, the which they never agilt hir live....\r\nI swore that all my walking out by night\r\nWas for to espien wenches that he dight....\r\nFor though the pope had sitten hem beside,\r\nI wold not spare hem at hir owen bord....\r\nBut certainly I made folk swiche chere,\r\nThat in his owen grese I made him frie\r\nFor anger, and for veray jalousie.\r\nBy God, in erth I was his purgatorie,\r\nFor which I hope his soule be in glorie.\"[223]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe saw the fifth first at the burial of the fourth:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And Jankin oure clerk was on of tho:\r\nAs helpe me God, whan that I saw him go\r\nAftir the bere, me thought he had a paire\r\nOf legges and of feet, so clene and faire,\r\nThat all my herte I yave unto his hold.\r\nHe was, I trow, a twenty winter old,\r\nAnd I was fourty, if I shal say soth....\r\nAs helpe me God, I was a lusty on,\r\nAnd faire, and riche, and yonge, and well begon.\"[224]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yonge,\" what a word! Was human delusion ever more happily painted? How\r\nlife-like is all, and how easy the tone. It is the satire of marriage.\r\nYou will find it twenty times in Chaucer. Nothing more is wanted to\r\nexhaust the two subjects of French mockery than to unite with the satire\r\nof marriage the satire of religion.\r\n\r\nWe find it here; and Rabelais is not more bitter. The monk whom Chaucer\r\npaints is a hypocrite, a jolly fellow, who knows good inns and jovial\r\nhosts better than the poor and the hospitals:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Frere there was, a wanton and a mery...\r\nFul wel beloved, and familier was he\r\nWith frankeleins over all in his contree,\r\nAnd eke with worthy wimmen of the toun...\r\nFull swetely herde he confession,\r\nAnd pleasant was his absolution.\r\nHe was an esy man to give penance,\r\nTher as he wiste to han a good pitance:\r\nFor unto a poure ordre for to give\r\nIs signe that a man is wel yshrive....\r\nAnd knew wel the tavernes in every toun,\r\nAnd every hosteler and gay tapstere,\r\nBetter than a lazar and a beggere....\r\nIt is not honest, it may not avance,\r\nAs for to delen with no swich pouraille,\r\nBut all with riche and sellers of vitaille....\r\nFor many a man so hard is of his herte,\r\nHe may not wepe, although him sore smerte.\r\nTherfore in stede of weping and praieres,\r\nMen mote give silver to the poure freres.\"[225]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lively irony had an exponent before in Jean de Meung. But Chaucer\r\npushes it further, and gives it life and motion. His monk begs from\r\nhouse to house, holding out his wallet:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In every hous he gan to pore and prie,\r\nAnd begged mele and chese, or elles corn....\r\n'Yeve us a bushel whete, or malt, or reye,\r\nA Goddes kichel, or a trippe of chese,\r\nOr elles what you list, we may not chese;\r\nA Goddes halfpeny, or a masse peny;\r\nOr yeve us of your braun, if ye have any,\r\nA dagon of your blanket, leve dame,\r\nOur suster dere (lo here I write your name).'...\r\nAnd whan that he was out at dore, anon,\r\nHe planed away the names everich on.\"[226]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe has kept for the end of his circuit, Thomas, one of his most liberal\r\nclients. He finds him in bed, and ill; here is excellent fruit to suck\r\nand squeeze:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'God wot,' quod he, 'laboured have I ful sore.\r\nAnd specially for thy salvation,\r\nHave I sayd many a precious orison....\r\nI have this day ben at your chirche at messe...\r\nAnd ther I saw our dame, a, wher is she?'\"[227]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dame enters:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This frere ariseth up ful curtisly,\r\nAnd hire embraceth in his armes narwe,\r\nAnd kisseth hire swete and chirketh as a sparwe.\"[228]...\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, in his sweetest and most caressing voice, he compliments her, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Thanked be God that you yaf soule and lif,\r\nYet saw I not this day so faire a wif\r\nIn all the chirche, God so save me.'\"[229]\r\n\r\n\r\nHave we not here already Tartuffe and Elmire? But the monk is with a\r\nfarmer, and can go to work more quickly and directly. When the\r\ncompliments ended, he thinks of the substance, and asks the lady to let\r\nhim talk alone with Thomas. He must inquire after the state of his soul:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'I wol with Thomas speke a litel throw:\r\nThise curates ben so negligent and slow\r\nTo gropen tendrely a conscience....\r\nNow, dame,' quod he, 'jeo vous die sanz doute,\r\nHave I nat of a capon but the liver,\r\nAnd of your white bred nat but a shiver,\r\nAnd after that a rosted pigges hed\r\n(But I ne wolde for me no beest were ded),\r\nThan had I with you homly suffisance.\r\nI am a man of litel sustenance,\r\nMy spirit hath his fostring in the Bible.\r\nMy body is ay so redy and penible\r\nTo waken, that my stomak is destroied.'\"[230]\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor man, he raises his hands to heaven, and ends with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe wife tells him her child died a fortnight before. Straightway he\r\nmanufactures a miracle; how could he earn his money in any better way?\r\nHe had a revelation of this death in the \"dortour\" of the convent; he\r\nsaw the child carried to paradise; he rose with his brothers, \"with many\r\na tere trilling on our cheke,\" and they sang a _Te Deum_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'For, sire and dame, trusteth me right wel,\r\nOur orisons ben more effectuel,\r\nAnd more we seen of Cristes secree thinges\r\nThan borel folk, although that they be kinges.\r\nWe live in poverte, and in abstinence,\r\nAnd borel folk in richesse and dispence....\r\nLazer and Dives liveden diversely,\r\nAnd divers guerdon hadden they therby.'\"[231]\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently he spurts out a whole sermon, in a loathsome style, and with\r\nan interest which is plain enough. The sick man, wearied, replies that\r\nhe has already given half his fortune to all kinds of monks, and yet he\r\ncontinually suffers. Listen to the grieved exclamation, the true\r\nindignation of the mendicant monk, who sees himself threatened by the\r\ncompetition of a brother of the cloth to share his client, his revenue,\r\nhis booty, his food-supplies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The frere answered: 'O Thomas, dost thou so?\r\nWhat nedeth you diverse freres to seche?\r\nWhat nedeth him that hath a parfit leche,\r\nTo sechen other leches in the toun?\r\nYour inconstance is your confusion.\r\nHold ye than me, or elles our covent,\r\nTo pray for you ben insufficient?\r\nThomas, that jape n' is not worth a mite,\r\nYour maladie is for we han to lite.'\"[232]\r\n\r\n\r\nRecognize the great orator; he employs even the grand style to keep the\r\nsupplies from being cut off:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'A, yeve that covent half a quarter otes;\r\nAnd yeve that covent four and twenty grotes;\r\nAnd yeve that frere a peny, and let him go:\r\nNay, nay, Thomas, it may no thing be so.\r\nWhat is a ferthing worth parted on twelve?\r\nLo, eche thing that is oned in himself\r\nIs more strong, than whan it is yscatered...\r\nThou woldest han our labour al for nought.'\"[233]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he begins again his sermon in a louder tone, shouting at each word,\r\nquoting examples from Seneca and the classics, a terrible fluency, a\r\ntrick of his trade, which, diligently applied, must draw money from the\r\npatient. He asks for gold, \"to make our cloistre,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... 'And yet, God wot, uneth the fundament\r\nParfourmed is, ne of our pavement\r\nN' is not a tile yet within our wones;\r\nBy God, we owen fourty pound for stones.\r\nNow help Thomas, for him that harwed helle,\r\nFor elles mote we oure bokes selle,\r\nAnd if ye lacke oure predication,\r\nThan goth this world all to destruction.\r\nFor who so fro this world wold us bereve,\r\nSo God me save, Thomas, by your leve,\r\nHe wold bereve out of this world the sonne.'\"[234]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, Thomas in a rage promises him a gift, tells him to put his\r\nhand in the bed and take it, and sends him away duped, mocked, and\r\ncovered with filth.\r\n\r\nWe have descended now to popular farce; when amusement must be had at\r\nany price, it is sought, as here, in broad jokes, even in filthiness. We\r\ncan see how these two coarse and vigorous plants have blossomed in the\r\ndung of the Middle Ages. Planted by the sly fellows of Champagne and\r\nIle-de-France, watered by the _trouvères_, they were destined fully to\r\nexpand, speckled and ruddy, in the large hands of Rabelais. Meanwhile\r\nChaucer plucks his nosegay from it. Deceived husbands, mishaps in inns,\r\naccidents in bed, cuffs, kicks, and robberies, these suffice to raise a\r\nloud laugh. Side by side with noble pictures of chivalry, he gives us a\r\ntrain of Flemish grotesque figures, carpenters, joiners, friars,\r\nsummoners; blows abound, fists descend on fleshy backs; many nudities\r\nare shown; they swindle one another out of their corn, their wives; they\r\npitch one another out of a window; they brawl and quarrel. A bruise, a\r\npiece of open filthiness, passes in such society for a sign of wit. The\r\nsummoner, being rallied by the friar, gives him tit for tat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'This Frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,\r\nAnd, God it wot, that is but litel wonder,\r\nFreres and fendes ben but litel asonder.\r\nFor parde, ye han often time herd telle\r\nHow that a Frere ravished was to helle\r\nIn spirit ones by a visoun,\r\nAnd as an angel lad him up and doun,\r\nTo shewen him the peines that ther were,...\r\nAnd unto Sathanas he lad him doun.\r\n(And now hath Sathanas,' saith he, 'a tayl\r\nBroder than of a Carrike is the sayl.)\r\nHold up thy tayl, thou Sathanas, quod he,\r\n....... and let the Frere see\r\nWher is the nest of Freres in this place.\r\nAnd er than half a furlong way of space,\r\nRight so as bees out swarmen of an hive,\r\nOut of the devils... ther gonnen to drive.\r\nA twenty thousand Freres on a route,\r\nAnd thurghout hell they swarmed all aboute,\r\nAnd com agen, as fast as they may gon.'\"[235]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the coarse buffooneries of the popular imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--The Art of Chaucer\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is high time to return to Chaucer himself. Beyond the two notable\r\ncharacteristics which settle his place in his age and school of poetry,\r\nthere are others which take him out of his age and school. If he was\r\nromantic and gay like the rest, it was after a fashion of his own. He\r\nobserves characters, notes their differences, studies the coherence of\r\ntheir parts, endeavors to describe living individualities--a thing\r\nunheard of in his time, but which the renovators in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and first among them Shakespeare, will do afterwards. Is it\r\nalready the English positive common-sense and aptitude for seeing the\r\ninside of things which begins to appear? A new spirit, almost manly,\r\npierces through, in literature as in painting, with Chaucer as with Van\r\nEyck, with both at the same time; no longer the childish imitation of\r\nchivalrous life[236] or monastic devotion, but the grave spirit of\r\ninquiry and craving for deep truths, whereby art becomes complete. For\r\nthe first time, in Chaucer as in Van Eyck, the character described\r\nstands out in relief; its parts are connected; it is no longer an\r\nunsubstantial phantom. You may guess its past and foretell its future\r\naction. Its externals manifest the personal and incommunicable details\r\nof its inner nature, and the infinite complexity of its economy and\r\nmotion. To this day, after four centuries, that character is\r\nindividualjzed and typical; it remains distinct in our memory, like the\r\ncreations of Shakespeare and Rubens. We observe this growth in the very\r\nact. Not only does Chaucer, like Boccaccio, bind his tales into a single\r\nhistory; but in addition--and this is wanting in Boccaccio--he begins\r\nwith the portrait of all his narrators, knight, summoner, man of law,\r\nmonk, bailiff or reeve, host, about thirty distinct figures, of every\r\nsex, condition, age, each painted with his disposition, face, costume,\r\nturns of speech, little significant actions, habits, antecedents, each\r\nmaintained in his character by his talk and subsequent actions, so that\r\nwe can discern here, sooner than in any other nation, the germ of the\r\ndomestic novel as we write it to-day. Think of the portraits of the\r\nfranklin, the miller, the mendicant friar, and wife of Bath. There are\r\nplenty of others which show the broad brutalities, the coarse, tricks,\r\nand the pleasantries of vulgar life, as well as the gross and plentiful\r\nfeastings of sensual life. Here and there honest old swashbucklers, who\r\ndouble their fists, and tuck up their sleeves; or contented beadles,\r\nwho, when they have drunk, will speak nothing but Latin. But by the side\r\nof these there are some choice characters; the knight, who went on a\r\ncrusade to Granada and Prussia, brave and courteous:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And though that he was worthy he was wise,\r\nAnd of his port as meke as is a mayde.\r\nHe never yet no vilanie ne sayde\r\nIn alle his lif, unto no manere wight,\r\nHe was a veray parfit gentil knight.\"[237]\r\n\r\n\"With him, ther was his sone, a yonge Squier,\r\nA lover, and a lusty bacheler,\r\nWith lockes crull as they were laide in presse.\r\nOf twenty yere of age he was I gesse.\r\nOf his stature he was of even lengthe,\r\nAnd wonderly deliver, and grete of strengthe.\r\nAnd he hadde be somtime in chevachie,\r\nIn Flaundres, in Artois, and in Picardie,\r\nAnd borne him wel, as of so litel space,\r\nIn hope to stonden in his ladies grace.\r\nEmbrouded was he, as it were a mede\r\nAlle ful of fresshe floures, white and rede.\r\nSinging he was, or floyting alle the day,\r\nHe was as fresshe, as is the moneth of May.\r\nShort was his goune, with sieves long and wide.\r\nWel coude he sitte on hors, and fayre ride.\r\nHe coude songes make, and wel endite,\r\nJuste and eke dance, and wel pourtraie and write.\r\nSo hote he loved, that by nightertale\r\nHe slep no more than doth the nightingale.\r\nCurteis he was, lowly and servisable,\r\nAnd carf befor his fader at the table.\"[238]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a poor and learned clerk of Oxford; and finer still, and\r\nmore worthy of a modern hand, the Prioress, \"Madame Eglantine,\" who as a\r\nnun, a maiden, a great lady, is ceremonious, and shows signs of\r\nexquisite taste. Would a better be found nowadays in a German chapter,\r\namid the most modest and lively bevy of sentimental and literary\r\ncanonesses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse,\r\nThat of hire smiling was ful simple and coy\r\nHire gretest othe n'as but by Seint Eloy;\r\nAnd she was cleped Madame Eglentine.\r\nFul wel she sange the service devine,\r\nEntuned in hire nose ful swetely;\r\nAnd Frenche she spake ful fayre and fetisly\r\nAfter the scole of Stratford-atte-bowe,\r\nFor Frenche of Paris was to hire unknowe.\r\nAt mete was she wel ytaughte withalle;\r\nSo lette no morsel from hire lippes falle,\r\nNo wette hire fingres in hire sauce depe.\r\nWel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,\r\nThatte no drope ne fell upon hire brest.\r\nIn curtesie was sette ful moche hire lest.\r\nHire over lippe wiped she so clene,\r\nThat in hire cuppe was no ferthing sene\r\nOf grese, whan she dronken hadde hire draught,\r\nFul semely after hire mete she raught.\r\nAnd sikerly she was of grete disport\r\nAnd ful plesant, and amiable of port,\r\nAnd peined hire to contrefeten chere\r\nOf court, and ben estatelich of manere,\r\nAnd to ben holden digne of reverence.\"[239]\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you offended by these provincial affectations? Not at all; it is\r\ndelightful to behold these nice and pretty ways, these little\r\naffectations, the waggery and prudery, the half-worldly, half-monastic\r\nsmile. We inhale a delicate feminine perfume, preserved and grown old\r\nunder the stomacher:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But for to speken of hire conscience,\r\nShe was so charitable and so pitous,\r\nShe wolde wepe if that she saw a mous\r\nCaughte in a trappe, if it were ded or bledde.\r\nOf smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde\r\nWith rosted flesh, and milk, and wastel brede.\r\nBut sore wept she if on of hem were dede,\r\nOr if men smote it with a yerde smert:\r\nAnd all was conscience and tendre herte.\"[240]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany elderly ladies throw themselves into such affections as these for\r\nlack of others. Elderly! what an objectionable word have I employed! She\r\nwas not elderly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ful semely hire wimple ypinched was,\r\nHire nose tretis; hire eyen grey as glas;\r\nHire mouth ful smale, and therto soft and red;\r\nBut sikerly she hadde a fayre forehed.\r\nIt was almost a spanne brode I trowe;\r\nFor hardily she was not undergrowe.\r\nFul fetise was hire cloke, as I was ware.\r\nOf small corall aboute hire arm she bare\r\nA pair of bedes, gauded al with grene;\r\nAnd thereon heng a broche of gold ful shene,\r\nOn whiche was first ywritten a crouned A,\r\nAnd after, Amor vincit omnia.\"[241]\r\n\r\n\r\nA pretty ambiguous device, suitable either for gallantry or devotion;\r\nthe lady was both of the world and the cloister: of the world, you may\r\nsee it in her dress; of the cloister, you gather it from \"another Nonne\r\nalso with hire hadde she, that was hire chapelleine, and Preestes thre\";\r\nfrom the Ave Maria which she sings, the long edifying stories which she\r\nrelates. She is like a fresh, sweet, and ruddy cherry, made to ripen in\r\nthe sun, but which, preserved in an ecclesiastical jar, has become\r\ncandied and insipid in the syrup.\r\n\r\nSuch is the power of reflection which begins to dawn, such the high art.\r\nChaucer studies here, rather than aims at amusement; he ceases to\r\ngossip, and thinks; instead of surrendering himself to the facility of\r\nflowing improvisation, he plans. Each tale is suited to the teller; the\r\nyoung squire relates a fantastic and Oriental history; the tipsy miller\r\na loose and comical story; the honest clerk the touching legend of\r\nGriselda. All these tales are bound together, and that much better than\r\nby Boccaccio, by little veritable incidents, which spring from the\r\ncharacters of the personages, and such as we light upon in our travels.\r\nThe horsemen ride on in good humor, in the sunshine, in the open\r\ncountry; they converse. The miller has drunk too much ale, and will\r\nspeak, \"and for no man forbere.\" The cook goes to sleep on his beast,\r\nand they play practical jokes on him. The monk and the summoner getup a\r\ndispute about their respective lines of business. The host restores\r\npeace, makes them speak or be silent, like a man who has long presided\r\nin the inn parlor, and who has often had to check brawlers. They pass\r\njudgment on the stories they listen to: declaring that there are few\r\nGriseldas in the world; laughing at the misadventures of the tricked\r\ncarpenter; drawing a lesson from the moral tale. The poem is no longer,\r\nas in the contemporary literature, a mere procession, but a painting in\r\nwhich the contrasts are arranged, the attitudes chosen, the general\r\neffect calculated, so that it becomes life and motion; we forget\r\nourselves at the sight, as in the case of every lifelike work; and we\r\nlong to get on horseback on a fine sunny morning, and canter along green\r\nmeadows with the pilgrims to the shrine of the good saint of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nWeigh the value of the words \"general effect.\" According as we plan it\r\nor not, we enter on our maturity or infancy! The whole future lies in\r\nthese two words. Savages or half savages, warriors of the Heptarchy or\r\nknights of the Middle Ages; up to this period, no one had reached to\r\nthis point. They had strong emotions, tender at times, and each\r\nexpressed them according to the original gift of his race, some by short\r\ncries, others by continuous babble. But they did not command or guide\r\ntheir impressions; they sang or conversed by impulse, at random,\r\naccording to the bent of their disposition, leaving their ideas to\r\npresent themselves as they might, and when they hit upon order, it was\r\nignorantly and involuntarily. Here for the first time appears a\r\nsuperiority of intellect, which at the instant of conception suddenly\r\nhalts, rises above itself, passes judgment, and says to itself, \"This\r\nphrase tells the same thing as the last--remove it; these two ideas are\r\ndisjointed—connect them; this description is feeble--reconsider it.\"\r\nWhen a man can speak thus he has an idea, not learned in the schools,\r\nbut personal and practical, of the human mind, its process and needs,\r\nand of things also, their composition and combinations; he has a style,\r\nthat is, he is capable of making everything understood and seen by the\r\nhuman mind. He can extract from every object, landscape, situation,\r\ncharacter, the special and significant marks, so as to group and arrange\r\nthem, in order to compose an artificial work which surpasses the natural\r\nwork in its purity and completeness. He is capable, as Chaucer was, of\r\nseeking out in the old common forest of the Middle Ages, stories and\r\nlegends, to replant them in his own soil, and make them send out new\r\nshoots. He has the right and the power, as Chaucer had, of copying and\r\ntranslating, because by dint of retouching he impresses on his\r\ntranslations and copies his original mark; he re-creates what he\r\nimitates, because through or by the side of worn-out fancies and\r\nmonotonous stories, he can display, as Chaucer did, the charming ideas\r\nof an amiable and elastic mind, the thirty master-forms of the\r\nfourteenth century, the splendid freshness of the verdurous landscape\r\nand spring-time of England. He is not far from conceiving an idea of\r\ntruth and life. He is on the brink of independent thought and fertile\r\ndiscovery. This was Chaucer's position. At the distance of a century and\r\na half, he has affinity with the poets of Elizabeth[242] by his gallery\r\nof pictures, and with the reformers of the sixteenth century by his\r\nportrait of the good parson.\r\n\r\nAffinity merely. He advanced a few steps beyond the threshold of his\r\nart, but he paused at the end of the vestibule. He half opens the great\r\ndoor of the temple, but does not take his seat there; at most, he sat\r\ndown in it only at intervals. In \"Arcite and Palamon,\" in \"Troilus and\r\nCressida,\" he sketches sentiments, but does not create characters; he\r\neasily and naturally traces the winding course of events and\r\nconversations, but does not mark the precise outline of a striking\r\nfigure. If occasionally, as in the description of the temple of Mars,\r\nafter the \"Thebaid\" of Statius, feeling at his back the glowing breeze\r\nof poetry, he draws out his feet, clogged with the mud of the Middle\r\nAges, and at a bound stands upon the poetic plain on which Statius\r\nimitated Vergil and equalled Lucan, he, at other times, again falls back\r\ninto the childish gossip of the _trouvères_, or the dull gabble of\r\nlearned clerks--to \"Dan Phebus or Apollo-Delphicus.\" Elsewhere, a\r\ncommonplace remark on art intrudes in the midst of an impassioned\r\ndescription. He uses three thousand verses to conduct Troilus to his\r\nfirst interview. He is like a precocious and poetical child, who mingles\r\nin his love-dreams quotations from his grammar and recollections of his\r\nalphabet.[243] Even in the \"Canterbury Tales\" he repeats himself,\r\nunfolds artless developments, forgets to concentrate his passion or his\r\nidea. He begins a jest, and scarcely ends it. He dilutes a bright\r\ncoloring in a monotonous stanza. His voice is like that of a boy\r\nbreaking into manhood. At first a manly and firm accent is maintained,\r\nthen a shrill sweet sound shows that his growth is not finished, and\r\nthat his strength is subject to weakness. Chaucer sets out as if to quit\r\nthe Middle Ages; but in the end he is there still. To-day he composes\r\nthe \"Canterbury Tales\"; yesterday he was translating the \"Roman de la\r\nRose.\" To-day he is studying the complicated machinery of the heart,\r\ndiscovering the issues of primitive education or of the ruling\r\ndisposition, and creating the comedy of manners; to-morrow he will have\r\nno pleasure but in curious events, smooth allegories, amorous\r\ndiscussions, imitated from the French, or learned moralities from the\r\nancients. Alternately he is an observer and a _trouvère_; instead of\r\nthe step he ought to have advanced, he has but made a half-step.\r\n\r\nWho has prevented him, and the others who surround him? We meet with the\r\nobstacle in the tales he has translated of Melibeus, of the Parson, in\r\nhis \"Testament of Love\" in short, so long as he writes verse, he is at\r\nhis ease; as soon as he takes to prose, a sort of chain winds around his\r\nfeet and stops him. His imagination is free, and his reasoning a slave.\r\nThe rigid scholastic divisions, the mechanical manner of arguing and\r\nreplying, the ergo, the Latin quotations, the authority of Aristotle and\r\nthe Fathers, come and weigh down his budding thought. His native\r\ninvention disappears under the discipline imposed. The servitude is so\r\nheavy that even in the work of one of his contemporaries, the \"Testament\r\nof Love,\" which, for a long time, was believed to be written by Chaucer,\r\namid the most touching plaints and the most smarting pains, the\r\nbeautiful ideal lady, the heavenly mediator who appears in a vision,\r\nLove, sets her theses, establishes that the cause of a cause is the\r\ncause of the thing caused, and reasons as pedantically as they would at\r\nOxford. In what can talent, even feeling, end, when it is kept down by\r\nsuch shackles? What succession of original truths and new doctrines\r\ncould be found and proved, when in a moral tale, like that of Melibeus\r\nand his wife Prudence, it was thought necessary to establish a formal\r\ncontroversy, to quote Seneca and Job, to forbid tears, to bring forward\r\nthe weeping Christ to authorize tears, to enumerate every proof, to call\r\nin Solomon, Cassiodorus, and Cato; in short, to write a book for\r\nschools? The public cares only for pleasant and lively thoughts; not\r\nserious and general ideas; these latter are for a special class only. As\r\nsoon as Chaucer gets into a reflective mood, straightway Saint Thomas,\r\nPeter Lombard, the manual of sins, the treatise on definition and\r\nsyllogism, the army of the ancients and of the Fathers, descend from\r\ntheir glory, enter his brain, speak in his stead; and the _trouvère's_\r\npleasant voice becomes the dogmatic and sleep-inspiring voice of a\r\ndoctor. In love and satire he has experience, and he invents; in what\r\nregards morality and philosophy he has learning, and copies. For an\r\ninstant, by a solitary leap, he entered upon the close observation, and\r\nthe genuine study of man; he could not keep his ground, he did not take\r\nhis seat, he took a poetic excursion; and no one followed him. The level\r\nof the century is lower; he is on it himself for the most part. He is in\r\nthe company of narrators like Froissart, of elegant speakers like\r\nCharles of Orléans, of gossipy and barren verse-writers like Gower,\r\nLydgate, and Occleve. There is no fruit, but frail and fleeting\r\nblossoms, many useless branches, still more dying or dead branches; such\r\nis this literature. And why? Because it had no longer a root; after\r\nthree centuries of effort, a heavy instrument cut it underground. This\r\ninstrument was the Scholastic Philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--Scholastic Philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath every literature there is a philosophy. Beneath, every work of\r\nart is an idea of nature and of life; this idea leads the poet. Whether\r\nthe author knows it or not, he writes in order to exhibit it; and the\r\ncharacters which he fashions, like the events which he arranges, only\r\nserve to bring to light the dim creative conception which raises and\r\ncombines them. Underlying Homer appears the noble life of heroic\r\npaganism and of happy Greece. Underlying Dante, the sad and violent life\r\nof fanatical Catholicism and of the much-hating Italians. From either we\r\nmight draw a theory of man and of the beautiful. It is so with others;\r\nand this is how, according to the variations, the birth, blossoms,\r\ndecline, or sluggishness of the master-idea, literature varies, is born,\r\nflourishes, degenerates, comes to an end. Whoever plants the one, plants\r\nthe other: whoever undermines the one, undermines the other. Place in\r\nall the minds of any age a new grand idea of nature and life, so that\r\nthey feel and produce it with their whole heart and strength, and you\r\nwill see them, seized with the craving to express it, invent forms of\r\nart and groups of figures. Take away from these minds every grand new\r\nidea of nature and life, and you will see them, deprived of the craving\r\nto express all-important thoughts, copy, sink into silence, or rave.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of all these all-important thoughts? What labor worked\r\nthem out? What studies nourished them? The laborers did not lack zeal.\r\nIn the twelfth century the energy of their minds was admirable. At\r\nOxford there were thirty thousand scholars. No building in Paris could\r\ncontain the crowd of Abelard's disciples; when he retired to solitude,\r\nthey accompanied him in such a multitude that the desert became a town.\r\nNo difficulty repulsed them. There is a story of a young boy, who,\r\nthough beaten by his master, was wholly bent on remaining with him, that\r\nhe might still learn. When the terrible encyclopædia of Aristotle was\r\nintroduced, though disfigured and unintelligible it was devoured. The\r\nonly question presented to them, that of universals, so abstract and\r\ndry, so embarrassed by Arabic obscurities and Greek subtitles, during\r\ncenturies, was seized upon eagerly. Heavy and awkward as was the\r\ninstrument supplied to them, I mean syllogism, they made themselves\r\nmasters of it, rendered it still more heavy, plunged it into every\r\nobject and in every direction. They constructed monstrous books, in\r\ngreat numbers, cathedrals of syllogism, of unheard-of architecture, of\r\nprodigious finish, heightened in effect by intensity of intellectual\r\npower, which the whole sum of human labor has only twice been able to\r\nmatch.[244] These young and valiant minds thought they had found the\r\ntemple of truth; they rushed at it headlong, in legions, breaking in the\r\ndoors, clambering over the walls, leaping into the interior, and so\r\nfound themselves at the bottom of a moat. Three centuries of labor at\r\nthe bottom of this black moat added not one idea to the human mind.\r\n\r\nFor consider the questions which they treat of. They seem to be\r\nmarching, but are merely marking time. People would say, to see them\r\nmoil and toil, that they will educe from heart and brain some great\r\noriginal creed, and yet all belief was imposed upon them from the\r\noutset. The system was made; they could only arrange and comment upon\r\nit. The conception comes not from them, but from Constantinople.\r\nInfinitely complicated and subtle as it is, the supreme work of Oriental\r\nmysticism and Greek metaphysics, so disproportioned to their young\r\nunderstanding, they exhaust themselves to reproduce it, and moreover\r\nburden their unpractised hands with the weight of a logical instrument\r\nwhich Aristotle created for theory and not for practice, and which ought\r\nto have remained in a cabinet of philosophical curiosities, without\r\nbeing ever carried into the field of action. \"Whether the divine essence\r\nengendered the Son, or was engendered by the Father; why the three\r\npersons together are not greater than one alone; attributes determine\r\npersons, not substance, that is, nature; how properties can exist in the\r\nnature of God, and not determine it; if created spirits are local and\r\ncan be circumscribed; if God can know more things than He is aware\r\nof\";[245]--these are the ideas which they moot: what truth could issue\r\nthence? From hand to hand the chimera grows, and spreads wider its\r\ngloomy wings. \"Can God cause that, the place and body being retained,\r\nthe body shall have no position, that is, existence in place?--Whether\r\nthe impossibility of being engendered is a constituent property of the\r\nFirst Person of the Trinity--Whether identity, similitude, and equality\r\nare real relations in God.\"[246] Duns Scotus distinguishes three kinds\r\nof matter: matter which is firstly first, secondly first, thirdly first.\r\nAccording to him, we must clear this triple hedge of thorny abstractions\r\nin order to understand the production of a sphere of brass. Under such a\r\nregimen, imbecility soon makes its appearance. Saint Thomas himself\r\nconsiders, \"whether the body of Christ arose with its wounds--whether\r\nthis body moves with the motion of the host and the chalice in\r\nconsecration--whether at the first instant of conception Christ had the\r\nuse of free judgment--whether Christ was slain by himself or by\r\nanother?\" Do you think you are at the limits of human folly? Listen. He\r\nconsiders \"whether the dove in which the Holy Spirit appeared was a real\r\nanimal--whether a glorified body can occupy one and the same place at\r\nthe same time as another glorified body--whether in the state of\r\ninnocence all children were masculine?\" I pass over others as to the\r\ndigestion of Christ, and some still more untranslatable.[247] This is\r\nthe point reached by the most esteemed doctor, the most judicious mind,\r\nthe Bossuet of the Middle Ages. Even in this ring of inanities the\r\nanswers are laid down. Roscellinus and Abelard were excommunicated,\r\nexiled, imprisoned, because they swerved from it. There is a complete\r\nminute dogma which closes all issues; there is no means of escaping;\r\nafter a hundred wriggles and a hundred efforts you must come and tumble\r\ninto a formula. If by mysticism you try to fly over their heads, if by\r\nexperience you endeavor to creep beneath, powerful talons await you at\r\nyour exit. The wise man passes for a magician, the enlightened man for a\r\nheretic. The Waldenses, the Catharists, the disciples of John of Parma,\r\nwere burned; Roger Bacon died only just in time, otherwise he might have\r\nbeen burned. Under this constraint men ceased to think; for he who\r\nspeaks of thought, speaks of an effort at invention, an individual\r\ncreation, an energetic action. They recite a lesson, or sing a\r\ncatechism; even in paradise, even in ecstasy and the divinest raptures\r\nof love, Dante thinks himself bound to show an exact memory and a\r\nscholastic orthodoxy. How then with the rest? Some, like Raymond Lully,\r\nset about inventing an instrument of reasoning to serve in place of the\r\nunderstanding. About the fourteenth century, under the blows of Occam,\r\nthis verbal science began to totter; they saw that its entities were\r\nonly words; it was discredited. In 1367, at Oxford, of thirty thousand\r\nstudents, there remained six thousand;[248] they still set their\r\n\"Barbara and Felapton,\" but only in the way of routine. Each one in turn\r\nmechanically traversed the petty region of threadbare cavils, scratched\r\nhimself in the briers of quibbles, and burdened himself with his bundle\r\nof texts; nothing more. The vast body of science which was to have\r\nformed and vivified the whole thought of man, was reduced to a\r\ntext-book.\r\n\r\nSo, little by little, the conception which fertilized and ruled all\r\nothers, dried up; the deep spring, whence flowed all poetic streams, was\r\nfound empty; science furnished nothing more to the world. What further\r\nworks could the world produce? As Spain, later on, renewing the Middle\r\nAges, after having shone splendidly and foolishly by her chivalry and\r\ndevotion, by Lope de Vega and Calderon, Loyola and St. Theresa, became\r\nenervated through the Inquisition and through casuistry, and ended by\r\nsinking into a brutish silence; so the Middle Ages, outstripping Spain,\r\nafter displaying the senseless heroism of the Crusades, and the poetical\r\necstasy of the cloister, after producing chivalry and saintship, Francis\r\nof Assisi, St. Louis, and Dante, languished under the Inquisition and\r\nthe scholastic learning, and became extinguished in idle raving and\r\ninanity.\r\n\r\nMust we quote all these good people who speak without having anything to\r\nsay? You may find them in Warton;[249] dozens of translators, importing\r\nthe poverties of French literature, and imitating imitations; rhyming\r\nchroniclers, most commonplace of men, whom we only read because we must\r\naccept history from every quarter, even from imbeciles; spinners and\r\nspinsters of didactic poems, who pile up verses on the training of\r\nfalcons, on heraldry, on chemistry; editors of moralities, who invent\r\nthe same dream over again for the hundredth time, and get themselves\r\ntaught universal history by the goddess Sapience. Like the writers of\r\nthe Latin decadence, these folk only think of copying, compiling,\r\nabridging, constructing in text-books, in rhymed memoranda, the\r\nencyclopædia of their times.\r\n\r\nListen to the most illustrious, the grave Gower--\"morall Gower,\" as he\r\nwas called![250] Doubtless here and there he contains a remnant of\r\nbrilliancy and grace. He is like an old secretary of a Court of Love,\r\nAndré le Chapelain or any other, who would pass the day in solemnly\r\nregistering the sentences of ladies, and in the evening, partly asleep\r\non his desk, would see in a half-dream their sweet smile and their\r\nbeautiful eyes.[251] The ingenious but exhausted vein of Charles of\r\nOrléans still flows in his French ballads. He has the same fondling\r\ndelicacy, almost a little affected. The poor little poetic spring flows\r\nyet in thin, transparent streamlets over the smooth pebbles, and murmurs\r\nwith a babble, pretty, but so low that at times you cannot hear it. But\r\ndull is the rest! His great poem, \"Confessio Amantis,\" is a dialogue\r\nbetween a lover and his confessor, imitated chiefly from Jean de Meung,\r\nhaving for object, like the \"Roman de la Rose,\" to explain and classify\r\nthe impediments of love. The superannuated theme is always reappearing,\r\ncovered by a crude erudition. You will find here an exposition of\r\nhermetic science, lectures on the philosophy of Aristotle, a treatise on\r\npolitics, a litany of ancient and modern legends gleaned from the\r\ncompilers, marred in the passage by the pedantry of the schools and the\r\nignorance of the age. It is a cartload of scholastic rubbish; the sewer\r\ntumbles upon this feeble spirit, which of itself was flowing clearly,\r\nbut now, obstructed by tiles, bricks, plaster, ruins from all quarters\r\nof the globe, drags on darkened and sluggish. Gower, one of the most\r\nlearned of his time,[252] supposed that Latin was invented by the old\r\nprophetess Carmentis; that the grammarians, Aristarchus, Donatus, and\r\nDidymus, regulated its syntax, pronunciation, and prosody; that it was\r\nadorned by Cicero with the flowers of eloquence and rhetoric; then\r\nenriched by translations from the Arabic, Chaldæan, and Greek; and that\r\nat last, after much labor of celebrated writers, it attained its final\r\nperfection in Ovid, the poet of love. Elsewhere he discovered that\r\nUlysses learned rhetoric from Cicero, magic from Zoroaster, astronomy\r\nfrom Ptolemy, and philosophy from Plato. And what a style! so long, so\r\ndull,[253] so drawn out by repetitions, the most minute details,\r\ngarnished with references to his text, like a man who, with his eyes\r\nglued to his Aristotle and his Ovid, a slave of his musty parchments,\r\ncan do nothing but copy and string his rhymes together. Schoolboys even\r\nin old age, they seem to believe that every truth, all wit, is their\r\ngreat wood-bound books; that they have no need to find out and invent\r\nfor themselves; that their whole business is to repeat; that this is, in\r\nfact, man's business. The scholastic system had enthroned the dead\r\nletter, and peopled the world with dead understandings.\r\n\r\nAfter Gower come Occleve and Lydgate.[254] \"My father Chaucer would\r\nwillingly have taught me,\" says Occleve, \"but I was dull, and learned\r\nlittle or nothing.\" He paraphrased in verse a treatise of Egidius, on\r\ngovernment; these are moralities. There are others, on compassion, after\r\nAugustine, and on the art of dying; then love-tales; a letter from\r\nCupid, dated from his court in the month of May. Love and\r\nmoralities,[255] that is, abstractions and affectation, were the taste\r\nof the time; and so, in the time of Lebrun, of Esménard, at the close\r\nof contemporaneous French literature,[256] they produced collections of\r\ndidactic poems, and odes to Chloris. As for the monk Lydgate, he had\r\nsome talent, some imagination, especially in high-toned descriptions: it\r\nwas the last flicker of a dying literature; gold received a golden\r\ncoating, precious stones were placed upon diamonds, ornaments multiplied\r\nand made fantastic; as in their dress and buildings, so in their\r\nstyle.[257] Look at the costumes of Henry IV and Henry V, monstrous\r\nheart-shaped or horn-shaped head-dresses, long sleeves covered with\r\nridiculous designs, the plumes, and again the oratories, armorial tombs,\r\nlittle gaudy chapels, like conspicuous flowers under the naves of the\r\nGothic perpendicular. When we can no more speak to the soul, we try to\r\nspeak to the eyes. This is what Lydgate does, nothing more. Pageants or\r\nshows are required of him, \"disguisings\" for the company of goldsmiths;\r\na mask before the king, a May entertainment for the sheriffs of London,\r\na drama of the creation for the festival of Corpus Christi, a\r\nmasquerade, a Christmas show; he gives the plan and furnishes the\r\nverses. In this matter he never runs dry; two hundred and fifty-one\r\npoems are attributed to him. Poetry thus conceived becomes a\r\nmanufacture; it is composed by the yard. Such was the judgment of the\r\nAbbot of St. Albans, who, having got him to translate a legend in verse,\r\npays a hundred shillings for the whole, verse, writing, and\r\nilluminations, placing the three works on a level. In fact, no more\r\nthought was required for the one than for the others. His three great\r\nworks, \"The Fall of Princes, The Destruction of Troy,\" and \"The Siege\r\nof Thebes,\" are only translations or paraphrases, verbose, erudite,\r\ndescriptive, a kind of chivalrous processions, colored for the twentieth\r\ntime, in the same manner, on the same vellum. The only point which rises\r\nabove the average, at least in the first poem, is the idea of\r\nFortune,[258] and the violent vicissitudes of human life. If there was a\r\nphilosophy at this time, this was it. They willingly narrated horrible\r\nand tragic histories; gather them from antiquity down to their own day;\r\nthey were far from the trusting and passionate piety which felt the hand\r\nof God in the government of the world; they saw that the world went\r\nblundering here and there like a drunken man. A sad and gloomy world,\r\namused by eternal pleasures, oppressed with a dull misery, which\r\nsuffered and feared without consolation or hope, isolated between the\r\nancient spirit in which it had no living hope, and the modern spirit\r\nwhose active science it ignored. Fortune, like a black smoke, hovers\r\nover all, and shuts out the sight of heaven. They picture it as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her face semyng cruel and terrible\r\nAnd by disdaynè menacing of loke,...\r\nAn hundred handes she had, of eche part...\r\nSome of her handes lyft up men alofte,\r\nTo hye estate of worldlye dignitè;\r\nAnother hande griped ful unsofte,\r\nWhich cast another in grete adversite.\"[259]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey look upon the great unhappy ones, a captive king, a dethroned\r\nqueen, assassinated princes, noble cities destroyed,[260] lamentable\r\nspectacles as exhibited in Germany and France, and of which there will\r\nbe plenty in England; and they can only regard them with a harsh\r\nresignation. Lydgate ends by reciting a commonplace of mechanical piety,\r\nby way of consolation. The reader makes the sign of the cross, yawns,\r\nand goes away. In fact, poetry and religion are no longer capable of\r\nsuggesting a genuine sentiment. Authors copy, and copy again. Hawes[261]\r\ncopies the \"House of Fame\" of Chaucer, and a sort of allegorical amorous\r\npoem, after the \"Roman de la Rose.\" Barclay[262] translates the \"Mirror\r\nof Good Manners\" and the \"Ship of Fools.\" Continually we meet with dull\r\nabstractions, used up and barren; it is the scholastic phase of poetry.\r\nIf anywhere there is an accent of greater originality, it is in this\r\n\"Ship of Fools,\" and in Lydgate's \"Dance of Death,\" bitter buffooneries,\r\nsad gayeties, which, in the hands of artists and poets, were having\r\ntheir run throughout Europe. They mock at each other, grotesquely and\r\ngloomily; poor, dull, and vulgar figures, shut up in a ship, or made to\r\ndance on their tomb to the sound of a fiddle, played by a grinning\r\nskeleton. At the end of all this mouldy talk, and amid the disgust which\r\nthey have conceived for each other, a clown, a tavern Triboulet,[263]\r\ncomposer of little jeering and macaronic verses, Skelton[264] makes his\r\nappearance, a virulent pamphleteer, who, jumbling together French,\r\nEnglish, Latin phrases, with slang, and fashionable words, invented\r\nwords, intermingled with short rhymes, fabricates a sort of literary\r\nmud, with which he bespatters Wolsey and the bishops. Style, metre,\r\nrhyme, language, art of every kind, is at an end; beneath the vain\r\nparade of official style there is only a heap of rubbish. Yet, as he\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Though my rhyme be ragged,\r\nTattered and gagged,\r\nRudely rain-beaten,\r\nRusty, moth-eaten,\r\nYf ye take welle therewithe,\r\nIt hath in it some pithe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is full of political animus, sensual liveliness, English and popular\r\ninstincts; it lives. It is a coarse life, still elementary, swarming\r\nwith ignoble vermin, like that which appears in a great decomposing\r\nbody. It is life, nevertheless, with its two great features which it is\r\ndestined to display: the hatred of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which\r\nis the Reformation; the return to the senses and to natural life, which\r\nis the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: Born between 1328 and 1345, died in 1400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Renan, \"De l'Art au Moyen Age.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: See Froissart, his life with the Count of Foix\r\nand with King Richard II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: \"Knight's Tale,\" II. p. 59, lines 1957-1964.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: \"Knight's Tale,\" II. p. 59, lines 1977-1996.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Ibid., p. 61, lines 2043-2050.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: \"Knight's Tale,\" II. p. 63, lines 2120-2188.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: The House of Fame.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: André le Chapelain, 1170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: Also the \"Court of Love,\" and perhaps \"The Assemble\r\nof Ladies\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: \"Troilus and Cressida,\" vol, V. bk. 3, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: \"Troilus and Cressida,\" vol.

It was the\r\nidea of the weakness and decay of the human race. Greek corruption,\r\nRoman oppression, and the dissolution of the ancient world, had given\r\nrise to it; it, in its turn, had produced a stoical resignation, an\r\nepicurean indifference, Alexandrian mysticism, and the Christian hope in\r\nthe kingdom of God. \"The world is evil and lost, let us escape by\r\ninsensibility, amazement, ecstasy.\" Thus spoke the philosophers; and\r\nreligion, coming after, announced that the end was near; \"Prepare, for\r\nthe kingdom of God is at hand.\" For a thousand years universal ruin\r\nincessantly drove still deeper into their hearts this gloomy thought;\r\nand when man in the feudal state raised himself, by sheer force of\r\ncourage and muscles, from the depths of final imbecility and general\r\nmisery, he discovered his thought and his work fettered by the crushing\r\nidea, which, forbidding a life of nature and worldly hopes, erected into\r\nideals the obedience of the monk and the dreams of fanatics.\r\n\r\nIt grew ever worse and worse. For the natural result of such a\r\nconception, as of the miseries which engender it, and the discouragement\r\nwhich it gives rise to, is to do away with personal action, and to\r\nreplace originality by submission. From the fourth century, gradually\r\nthe dead letter was substituted for the living faith. Christians\r\nresigned themselves into the hands of the clergy, they into the hands of\r\nthe pope. Christian opinions were subordinated to theologians, and\r\ntheologians to the Fathers. Christian faith was reduced to the\r\naccomplishment of works, and works to the accomplishment of ceremonies.\r\nReligion, fluid during the first centuries, was now congealed into a\r\nhard crystal, and the coarse contact of the barbarians had deposited\r\nupon its surface a layer of idolatry; theocracy and the Inquisition, the\r\nmonopoly of the clergy and the prohibition of the Scriptures, the\r\nworship of relics and the sale of indulgences began to appear. In place\r\nof Christianity, the church; in place of a free creed, enforced\r\northodoxy; in place of moral fervor, fixed religious practices; in place\r\nof the heart and stirring thought, outward and mechanical discipline:\r\nsuch are the characteristics of the Middle Ages. Under this constraint\r\nthinking society had ceased to think; philosophy was turned into a\r\ntext-book, and poetry into dotage; and mankind, slothful and crouching,\r\ndelivering up their conscience and their conduct into the hands of their\r\npriests, seemed but as puppets, fit only for reciting a catechism and\r\nmumbling over beads.[265]\r\n\r\nAt last invention makes another start; and it makes it by the efforts of\r\nthe lay society, which rejected theocracy, kept the State free, and\r\nwhich presently discovered, or rediscovered, one after another, the\r\nindustries, sciences, and arts. All was renewed; America and the Indies\r\nwere added to the map of the world; the shape of the earth was\r\nascertained, the system of the universe propounded, modern philology was\r\ninaugurated, the experimental sciences set on foot, art and literature\r\nshot forth like a harvest, religion was transformed; there was no\r\nprovince of human intelligence and action which was not refreshed and\r\nfertilized by this universal effort. It was so great that it passed from\r\nthe innovators to the laggards, and reformed Catholicism in the face of\r\nProtestantism which it formed. It seems as though men had suddenly\r\nopened their eyes and seen. In fact, they attain a new and superior kind\r\nof intelligence. It is the proper feature of this age that men no longer\r\nmake themselves masters of objects by bits, or isolated, or through\r\nscholastic or mechanical classifications, but as a whole, in general and\r\ncomplete views, with the eager grasp of a sympathetic spirit, which\r\nbeing placed before a vast object, penetrates it in all its parts, tries\r\nit in all its relations, appropriates and assimilates it, impresses upon\r\nitself its living and potent image, so life-like and so powerful, that\r\nit is fain to translate it into externals through a work of art or an\r\naction. An extraordinary warmth of soul, a superabundant and splendid\r\nimagination, reveries, visions, artists, believers, founders,\r\ncreators--that is what such a form of intellect produces; for to create\r\nwe must have, as had Luther and Loyola, Michel Angelo and Shakespeare,\r\nan idea, not abstract, partial, and dry, but well defined, finished,\r\nsensible--a true creation, which acts inwardly, and struggles to appear\r\nto the light. This was Europe's grand age, and the most notable epoch of\r\nhuman growth. To this day we live from its sap; we only carry on its\r\npressure and efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--Growth of New Ideas\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen human power is manifested so clearly and in such great works, it is\r\nno wonder if the ideal changes, and the old pagan idea reappears. It\r\nrecurs, bringing with it the worship of beauty and vigor, first in\r\nItaly; for this, of all countries in Europe, is the most pagan, and the\r\nnearest to the ancient civilization; thence in France and Spain, and\r\nFlanders, and even in Germany; and finally in England. How is it\r\npropagated? What revolution of manners reunited mankind at this time,\r\neverywhere, under a sentiment which they had forgotten for fifteen\r\nhundred years? Merely that their condition had improved, and they felt\r\nit. The idea ever expresses the actual situation, and the creatures of\r\nthe imagination, like the conceptions of the mind, only manifest the\r\nstate of society and the degree of its welfare; there is a fixed\r\nconnection between what man admires and what he is. While misery\r\noverwhelms him, while the decadence is visible, and hope shut out, he is\r\ninclined to curse his life on earth, and seek consolation in another\r\nsphere. As soon as his sufferings are alleviated, his power made\r\nmanifest, his prospects brightened, he begins once more to love the\r\npresent life, to be self-confident, to love and praise energy, genius,\r\nall the effective faculties which labor to procure him happiness. About\r\nthe twentieth year of Elizabeth's reign, the nobles gave up shield and\r\ntwo-handed sword for the rapier;[266] a little, almost imperceptible\r\nfact, yet vast, for it is like the change which sixty years ago made us\r\ngive up the sword at court, to leave us with our arms swinging about in\r\nour black coats. In fact, it was the close of feudal life, and the\r\nbeginning of court life, just as today court life is at an end, and the\r\ndemocratic reign has begun. With the two-handed swords, heavy coats of\r\nmail, feudal keeps, private warfare, permanent disorder, all the\r\nscourges of the Middle Ages retired, and faded into the past. The\r\nEnglish had done with the Wars of the Roses. They no longer ran the risk\r\nof being pillaged to-morrow for being rich, and hanged the next day for\r\nbeing traitors; they have no further need to furbish up their armor,\r\nmake alliances with powerful nations, lay in stores for the winter,\r\ngather together men-at-arms, scour the country to plunder and hang\r\nothers.[267] The monarchy, in England, as throughout Europe, establishes\r\npeace in the community,[268] and with peace appear the useful arts.\r\nDomestic comfort follows civil security; and man, better furnished in\r\nhis home, better protected in his hamlet, takes pleasure in his life on\r\nearth, which he has changed, and means to change.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the fifteenth century[269] the impetus was given;\r\ncommerce and the woolen trade made a sudden advance, and such an\r\nenormous one that corn-fields were changed into pasture-lands, \"whereby\r\nthe inhabitants of the said town (Manchester) have gotten and come into\r\nriches and wealthy livings,\"[270] so that in 1553, 40,000 pieces of\r\ncloth were exported in English ships. It was already the England which\r\nwe see to-day, a land of green meadows, intersected by hedgerows,\r\ncrowded with cattle, and abounding in ships--a manufacturing opulent\r\nland, with a people of beef-eating toilers, who enrich it while they\r\nenrich themselves. They improved agriculture to such an extent that in\r\nhalf a century the produce of an acre was doubled.[271] They grew so\r\nrich that at the beginning of the reign of Charles I the Commons\r\nrepresented three times the wealth of the Upper House. The ruin of\r\nAntwerp by the Duke of Parma[272] sent to England \"the third part of the\r\nmerchants and manufacturers, who made silk, damask, stockings, taffetas,\r\nand serges.\" The defeat of the Armada and the decadence of Spain opened\r\nthe seas to English merchants.[273] The toiling hive, who would dare,\r\nattempt, explore, act in unison, and always with profit, was about to\r\nreap its advantages and set out on its voyages, buzzing over the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nAt the base and on the summit of society, in all ranks of life, in all\r\ngrades of human condition, this new welfare became visible. In 1534,\r\nconsidering that the streets of London were \"very noyous and foul, and\r\nin many places thereof very jeopardous to all people passing and\r\nrepassing, as well on horseback as on foot,\" Henry VIII began the paving\r\nof the city. New streets covered the open spaces where the young men\r\nused to run races and to wrestle. Every year the number of taverns,\r\ntheatres, gambling-rooms, bear-gardens, increased. Before the time of\r\nElizabeth the country-houses of gentlemen were little more than\r\nstraw-thatched cottages, plastered with the coarsest clay, lighted only\r\nby trellises. \"Howbeit,\" says Harrison (1580), \"such as be latelie\r\nbuilded are commonlie either of bricke or hard stone, or both; their\r\nroomes large and comelie, and houses of office further distant from\r\ntheir lodgings.\" The old wooden houses were covered with plaster,\r\n\"which, beside the delectable whitenesse of the stuffe itselfe, is laied\r\non so even and smoothlie, as nothing in my judgment can be done with\r\nmore exactnesse.\"[274] This open admiration shows from what hovels they\r\nhad escaped. Glass was at last employed for windows, and the bare walls\r\nwere covered with hangings, on which visitors might see, with delight\r\nand astonishment, plants, animals, figures. They began to use stoves,\r\nand experienced the unwonted pleasure of being warm. Harrison notes\r\nthree important changes which had taken place in the farm-houses of his\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One is, the multitude of chimnies lately erected, whereas in their\r\nyoong daies there were not above two or three, if so manie, in most\r\nuplandishe townes of the realme.... The second is the great (although\r\nnot generall), amendment of lodging, for our fathers (yea and we\r\nourselves also) have lien full oft upon straw pallets, on rough mats\r\ncovered onelie with a sheet, under coverlets made of dagswain, or\r\nhop-harlots, and a good round log under their heads, insteed of a\r\nbolster or pillow. If it were so that the good man of the house, had\r\nwithin seven yeares after his marriage purchased a matteres or\r\nflockebed, and thereto a sacke of chaffe to rest his head upon, he\r\nthought himselfe to be as well lodged as the lord of the towne....\r\nPillowes (said they) were thought meet onelie for women in childbed....\r\nThe third thing is the exchange of vessell, as of treene platters into\r\npewter, and wodden spoones into silver or tin; for so common was all\r\nsorts of treene stuff in old time, that a man should hardlie find four\r\npeeces of pewter (of which one was peradventure a salt) in a good\r\nfarmers house.\"[275]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possession, but acquisition, which gives men pleasure and\r\nsense of power; they observe sooner a small happiness, new to them, than\r\na great happiness which is old. It is not when all is good, but when all\r\nis better, that they see the bright side of life, and are tempted to\r\nmake a holiday of it. This is why at this period they did make a holiday\r\nof it, a splendid show, so like a picture that it fostered painting in\r\nItaly, so like a piece of acting that it produced the drama in England.\r\nNow that the axe and sword of the civil wars had beaten down the\r\nindependent nobility, and the abolition of the law of maintenance had\r\ndestroyed the petty royalty of each great feudal baron, the lords\r\nquitted their sombre castles, battlemented fortresses, surrounded by\r\nstagnant water, pierced with narrow windows, a sort of stone\r\nbreastplates of no use but to preserve the life of their master. They\r\nflock into new palaces with vaulted roofs and turrets, covered with\r\nfantastic and manifold ornaments, adorned with terraces and vast\r\nstaircases, with gardens, fountains, statues, such as were the palaces\r\nof Henry VIII and Elizabeth, half Gothic and half Italian,[276] whose\r\nconvenience, splendor, and symmetry announced already habits of society,\r\nand the taste for pleasure. They came to court and abandoned their old\r\nmanners; the four meals which scarcely sufficed their former voracity\r\nwere reduced to two; gentlemen soon became refined, placing their glory\r\nin the elegance and singularity of their amusements and their clothes.\r\nThey dressed magnificently in splendid materials, with the luxury of men\r\nwho rustle silk and make gold sparkle for the first time: doublets of\r\nscarlet satin; cloaks of sable, costing a thousand ducats; velvet shoes,\r\nembroidered with gold and silver, covered with rosettes and ribbons;\r\nboots with falling tops, from whence hung a cloud of lace, embroidered\r\nwith figures of birds, animals, constellations, flowers in silver, gold,\r\nor precious stones; ornamented shirts costing ten pounds a piece. \"It is\r\na common thing to put a thousand goats and a hundred oxen on a coat, and\r\nto carry a whole manor on one's back.\"[277] The costumes of the time\r\nwere shrines. When Elizabeth died, they found three thousand dresses in\r\nher wardrobe. Need we speak of the monstrous ruffs of the ladies, their\r\npuffed-out dresses, their stomachers stiff with diamonds? Asa singular\r\nsign of the times, the men were more changeable and more bedecked than\r\nthey. Harrison says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Such is our mutabilitie, that to daie there is none to the Spanish\r\nguise, to morrow the French toies are most fine and delectable, yer long\r\nno such apparell as that which is after the high Alman fashion, by and\r\nby the Turkish maner is generallie best liked of, otherwise the Morisco\r\ngowns, the Barbarian sleeves... and the short French breeches.... And\r\nas these fashions are diverse, so likewise it is a world to see the\r\ncostlinesse and the curiositie; the excesse and the vanitie; the pompe\r\nand the braverie; the change and the varietie; and finallie, the\r\nficklenesse and the follie that is in all degrees.\"[278]\r\n\r\n\r\nFolly, it may have been, but poetry likewise. There was something more\r\nthan puppyism in this masquerade of splendid costume. The overflow of\r\ninner sentiment found this issue, as also in drama and poetry. It was an\r\nartistic spirit which induced it. There was an incredible outgrowth of\r\nliving forms from their brains. They acted like their engravers, who\r\ngive us in their frontispieces a prodigality of fruits, flowers, active\r\nfigures, animals, gods, and pour out and confuse the whole treasure of\r\nnature in every corner of their paper. They must enjoy the beautiful;\r\nthey would be happy through their eyes; they perceive in consequence\r\nnaturally the relief and energy of forms. From the accession of Henry\r\nVIII to the death of James I we find nothing but tournaments,\r\nprocessions, public entries, masquerades. First come the royal banquets,\r\ncoronation displays, large and noisy pleasures of Henry VIII. Wolsey\r\nentertains him\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In so gorgeous a sort and costlie maner, that it was an heaven to\r\nbehold. There wanted no dames or damosels meet or apt to danse with the\r\nmaskers, or to garnish the place for the time: then was there all kind\r\nof musike and harmonie, with fine voices both of men and children. On a\r\ntime the king came suddenlie thither in a maske with a dozen maskers all\r\nin garments like sheepheards, made of fine cloth of gold, and crimosin\r\nsattin paned,... having sixteene torch-bearers.... In came a new banket\r\nbefore the king wherein were served two hundred diverse dishes, of\r\ncostlie devises and subtilities. Thus passed they foorth the night with\r\nbanketting, dansing, and other triumphs, to the great comfort of the\r\nking, and pleasant regard of the nobilitie there assembled.\"[279]\r\n\r\n\r\nCount, if you can, the mythological entertainments, the theatrical\r\nreceptions, the open-air operas played before Elizabeth, James, and\r\ntheir great lords.[280] At Kenilworth the pageants lasted ten days.\r\nThere was everything; learned recreations, novelties, popular plays,\r\nsanguinary spectacles, coarse farces, juggling and feats of skill,\r\nallegories, mythologies, chivalric exhibitions, rustic and national\r\ncommemorations. At the same time, in this universal outburst and sudden\r\nexpanse, men become interested in themselves, find their life desirable,\r\nworthy of being represented and put on the stage complete; they play\r\nwith it, delight in looking upon it, love its ups and downs, and make of\r\nit a work of art. The queen is received by a sibyl, then by giants of\r\nthe time of Arthur, then by the Lady of the Lake, Sylvanus, Pomona,\r\nCeres, and Bacchus, every divinity in turn presents her with the\r\nfirst-fruits of his empire. Next day, a savage, dressed in moss and ivy,\r\ndiscourses before her with Echo in her praise. Thirteen bears are set\r\nfighting against dogs. An Italian acrobat performs wonderful feats\r\nbefore the whole assembly. A rustic marriage takes place before the\r\nqueen, then a sort of comic fight amongst the peasants of Coventry, who\r\nrepresent the defeat of the Danes. As she is returning from the chase,\r\nTriton, rising from the lake, prays her, in the name of Neptune, to\r\ndeliver the enchanted lady, pursued by a cruel knight, Syr Bruse sauns\r\nPitee. Presently the lady appears, surrounded by nymphs, followed close\r\nby Proteus, who is borne by an enormous dolphin. Concealed in the\r\ndolphin, a band of musicians with a chorus of ocean-deities, sing the\r\npraise of the powerful, beautiful, chaste queen of England.[281] You\r\nperceive that comedy is not confined to the theatre; the great of the\r\nrealm and the queen herself become actors. The cravings of the\r\nimagination are so keen that the court becomes a stage. Under James I,\r\nevery year, on Twelfth-day, the queen, the chief ladies and nobles,\r\nplayed a piece called a Masque, a sort of allegory combined with dances,\r\nheightened in effect by decorations and costumes of great splendor, of\r\nwhich the mythological paintings of Rubens can alone give an idea:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The attire of the lords was from the antique Greek statues. On their\r\nheads they wore Persic crowns, that were with scrolls of gold plate\r\nturned outward, and wreathed about with a carnation and silver net-lawn.\r\nTheir bodies were of carnation cloth of silver; to express the naked, in\r\nmanner of the Greek thorax, girt under the breasts with a broad belt of\r\ncloth of gold, fastened with jewels; the mantles were of coloured silke;\r\nthe first, sky-colour; the second, pearl-colour; the third, flame\r\ncolour; the fourth, tawny. The ladies attire was of white cloth of\r\nsilver, wrought with Juno's birds and fruits; a loose under garment,\r\nfull gathered, of carnation, striped with silver, and parted with a\r\ngolden zone; beneath that, another flowing garment, of watchet cloth of\r\nsilver, laced with gold; their hair carelessly bound under the circle of\r\na rare and rich coronet, adorned with all variety, and choice of jewels;\r\nfrom the top of which flowed a transparent veil, down to the ground.\r\nTheir shoes were azure and gold, set with rubies and diamonds.\"[282]\r\n\r\n\r\nI abridge the description, which is like a fairy tale. Fancy that all\r\nthese costumes, this glitter of materials, this sparkling of diamonds,\r\nthis splendor of nudities, was displayed daily at the marriage of the\r\ngreat, to the bold sounds of a pagan epithalamium. Think of the feasts\r\nwhich the Earl of Carlisle introduced, where was served first of all a\r\ntable loaded with sumptuous viands, as high as a man could reach, in\r\norder to remove it presently, and replace it by another similar table.\r\nThis prodigality of magnificence, these costly follies, this unbridling\r\nof the imagination, this intoxication of eye and ear, this comedy played\r\nby the lords of the realm, like the pictures of Rubens, Jordaens, and\r\ntheir Flemish contemporaries, so open an appeal to the senses, so\r\ncomplete a return to nature, that our chilled and gloomy age is scarcely\r\nable to imagine it.[283]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Popular Festivals\r\n\r\n\r\nTo vent the feelings, to satisfy the heart and eyes, to set free boldly\r\non all the roads of existence the pack of appetites and instincts, this\r\nwas the craving which the manners of the time betrayed. It was \"merry\r\nEngland,\" as they called it then. It was not yet stern and constrained.\r\nIt expanded widely, freely, and rejoiced to find itself so expanded. No\r\nlonger at court only was the drama found, but in the village. Strolling\r\ncompanies betook themselves thither, and the country folk supplied any\r\ndeficiencies, when necessary. Shakespeare saw, before he depicted them,\r\nstupid fellows, carpenters, joiners, bellows-menders, play Pyramus and\r\nThisbe, represent the lion roaring as gently as any sucking dove, and\r\nthe wall, by stretching out their hands. Every holiday was a pageant, in\r\nwhich townspeople, workmen, and children bore their parts. They were\r\nactors by nature. When the soul is full and fresh, it does not express\r\nits ideas by reasonings; it plays and figures them; it mimics them; that\r\nis the true and original language, the children's tongue, the speech of\r\nartists, of invention, and of joy. It is in this manner they please\r\nthemselves with songs and feasting, on all the symbolic holidays with\r\nwhich tradition has filled the year.[284] On the Sunday after\r\nTwelfth-night the laborers parade the streets, with their shirts over\r\ntheir coats, decked with ribbons, dragging a plough to the sound of\r\nmusic, and dancing a sword-dance; on another day they draw in a cart a\r\nfigure made of ears of corn, with songs, flutes, and drums; on another,\r\nFather Christmas and his company; or else they enact the history of\r\nRobin Hood, the bold archer, around the May-pole, or the legend of Saint\r\nGeorge and the Dragon. We might occupy half a volume in describing all\r\nthese holidays, such as Harvest Home, All Saints, Martinmas,\r\nSheepshearing, above all Christmas, which lasted twelve days, and\r\nsometimes six weeks. They eat and drink, junket, tumble about, kiss the\r\ngirls, ring the bells, satiate themselves with noise: coarse drunken\r\nrevels, in which man is an unbridled animal, and which are the\r\nincarnation of natural life. The Puritans made no mistake about that.\r\nStubbes says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"First, all the wilde heades of the parishe, conventying together, chuse\r\nthem a ground capitaine of mischeef, whan they innoble with the title of\r\nmy Lorde of Misserule, and hym they crown with great solemnitie, and\r\nadopt for their kyng. This kyng anoynted, chuseth for the twentie,\r\nfourtie, three score, or a hundred lustie guttes like to hymself to\r\nwaite uppon his lordely maiestie.... Then have they their hobbie horses,\r\ndragons, and other antiques, together with their baudie pipers and\r\nthunderyng drommers, to strike up the devilles daunce withall: then\r\nmarche these heathen companie towardes the churche and churche-yarde,\r\ntheir pipers pipyng, their drommers thonderyng, their stumppes dauncyng,\r\ntheir belles rynglyng, their handkerchefes swyngyng about their heads\r\nlike madmen, their hobbie horses and other monsters skirmishyng amongest\r\nthe throng; and in this sorte they goe to the churche (though the\r\nminister be at praier or preachyng), dauncyng, and swingyng their\r\nhandkercheefes over their heades, in the churche, like devilles\r\nincarnate, with such a confused noise, that no man can heare his owne\r\nvoice. Then the foolishe people they looke, they stare, they laugh, they\r\nfleere, and mount upon formes and pewes, to see these goodly pageauntes,\r\nsolemnized in this sort. Then after this, aboute the churche they goe\r\nagaine and againe, and so forthe into the churche-yarde, where they have\r\ncommonly their sommer haules, their bowers, arbours, and banquettyng\r\nhouses set up, wherein they feaste, banquet, and daunce all that daie,\r\nand peradventure all that night too. And thus these terrestriall furies\r\nspend the Sabbaoth daie!... An other sorte of fantasticall fooles bringe\r\nto these helhoundes (the Lorde of Misrule and his complices) some bread,\r\nsome good ale, some newe cheese, some olde cheese, some custardes, some\r\ncakes, some flaunes, some tartes, some creame, some meate, some one\r\nthing, some an other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe continues thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Against Maie, every parishe, towne and village essemble themselves\r\ntogether, bothe men, women, and children, olde and yong, even all\r\nindifferently; they goe to the woodes where they spende all the night in\r\npleasant pastymes, and in the mornyng they returne, bringing with them\r\nbirch, bowes, and branches of trees, to deck their assemblies with-all.\r\nBut their cheefest iewell they bringe from thence is their Maie poole,\r\nwhiche they bring home with great veneration, as thus: They have twenty\r\nor fourtie yoke of oxen, every ox havyng a sweete nosegaie of flowers\r\ntyed on the tippe of his homes, and these oxen, drawe home this Maie\r\npoole (this stinckyng idoll rather)... and thus beyng reared up, they\r\nstrawe the grounde aboute, binde greene boughes about it, sett up sommer\r\nhaules, bowers, and arbours hard by it; and then fall they to banquet\r\nand feast, to leape and daunce aboute it, as the heathen people did at\r\nthe dedication of their idolles.... Of a hundred maides goyng to the\r\nwoode over night, there have scarcely the third parte returned home\r\nagaine undefiled.\"[285]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On Shrove Tuesday,\" says another,[286] \"at the sound of a bell, the\r\nfolk become insane, thousands at a time, and forget all decency and\r\ncommon-sense.... It is to Satan and the devil that they pay homage and\r\ndo sacrifice to in these abominable pleasures.\" It is in fact to nature,\r\nto the ancient Pan, to Freya, to Hertha, her sisters, to the old\r\nTeutonic deities who survived the Middle Ages. At this period, in the\r\ntemporary decay of Christianity, and the sudden advance of corporal\r\nwell-being, man adored himself, and there endured no life within him but\r\nthat of paganism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Influence of Classic Literature\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, observe the process of ideas at this time. A few sectarians,\r\nchiefly in the towns and of the people, clung gloomily to the Bible. But\r\nthe court and the men of the world sought their teachers and their\r\nheroes from pagan Greece and Rome. About 1490[287] they began to read\r\nthe classics; one after the other they translated them; it was soon the\r\nfashion to read them in the original. Queen Elizabeth, Jane Grey, the\r\nDuchess of Norfolk, the Countess of Arundel, and many other ladies, were\r\nconversant with Plato, Xenophon, and Cicero in the original, and\r\nappreciated them. Gradually, by an insensible change, men were raised to\r\nthe level of the great and healthy minds who had freely handled ideas of\r\nall kinds fifteen centuries before. They comprehended not only their\r\nlanguage, but their thought; they did not repeat lessons from, but held\r\nconversations with them; they were their equals, and found in them\r\nintellects as manly as their own. For they were not scholastic\r\ncavillers, miserable compilers, repulsive pedants, like the professors\r\nof jargon whom the Middle Ages had set over them, like gloomy Duns\r\nScotus, whose leaves Henry VII's visitors scattered to the winds. They\r\nwere gentlemen, statesmen, the most polished and best educated men in\r\nthe world, who knew how to speak, and draw their ideas, not from books,\r\nbut from things, living ideas, and which entered of themselves into\r\nliving souls. Across the train of hooded schoolmen and sordid cavillers\r\nthe two adult and thinking ages were united, and the moderns, silencing\r\nthe infantine or snuffling voices of the Middle Ages, condescended only\r\nto converse with the noble ancients. They accepted their gods, at least\r\nthey understand them, and keep them by their side. In poems, festivals,\r\non hangings, almost in all ceremonies, they appear, not restored by\r\npedantry merely, but kept alive by sympathy, and endowed by the arts\r\nwith a life as flourishing and almost as profound as that of their\r\nearliest birth. After the terrible night of the Middle Ages, and the\r\ndolorous legends of spirits and the damned, it was a delight to see\r\nagain Olympus shining upon us from Greece; its heroic and beautiful\r\ndeities once more ravishing the heart of men; they raised and instructed\r\nthis young world by speaking to it the language of passion and genius;\r\nand this age of strong deeds, free sensuality, bold invention, had only\r\nto follow its own bent, in order to discover in them its masters and the\r\neternal promoters of liberty and beauty.\r\n\r\nNearer still was another paganism, that of Italy; the more seductive\r\nbecause more modern, and because it circulates fresh sap in an ancient\r\nstock; the more attractive, because more sensuous and present, with its\r\nworship of force and genius, of pleasure and voluptuousness. The\r\nrigorists knew this well, and were shocked at it. Ascham writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These bee the inchantementes of Circes, brought out of Italie to marre\r\nmens maners in England; much, by example of ill life, but more by\r\npreceptes of fonde bookes, of late translated out of Italian into\r\nEnglish, sold in every shop in London.... There bee moe of these\r\nungratious bookes set out in Printe wythin these fewe monethes, than\r\nhave bene sene in England many score yeares before.... Than they have in\r\nmore reverence the triumphes of Petrarche: than the Genesis of Moses:\r\nThey make more account of Tullies offices, than S. Paules epistles: of a\r\ntale in Bocace than a storie of the Bible.\"[288]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, at that time Italy clearly led in everything, and civilization\r\nwas to be drawn thence, as from its spring. What is this civilization\r\nwhich is thus imposed on the whole of Europe, whence every science and\r\nevery elegance comes, whose laws are obeyed in every court, in which\r\nSurrey, Sidney, Spenser, Shakespeare sought their models and their\r\nmaterials? It was pagan in its elements and its birth; in its language,\r\nwhich is but Latin, hardly changed; in its Latin traditions and\r\nrecollections, which no gap has interrupted; in its constitution, whose\r\nold municipal life first led and absorbed the feudal life; in the genius\r\nof its race, in which energy and joy always abounded. More than a\r\ncentury before other nations--from the time of Petrarch, Rienzi,\r\nBoccaccio--the Italians began to recover the lost antiquity, to set free\r\nthe manuscripts buried in the dungeons of France and Germany, to\r\nrestore, interpret, comment upon, study the ancients, to make themselves\r\nLatin in heart and mind, to compose in prose and verse with the polish\r\nof Cicero and Vergil, to hold sprightly converse and intellectual\r\npleasures as the ornament and the fairest flower of life.[289] They\r\nadopt not merely the externals of the life of the ancients, but its very\r\nessence; that is, preoccupation with the present life, forgetfulness of\r\nthe future, the appeal to the senses, the renunciation of Christianity.\r\n\"We must enjoy,\" sang their first poet, Lorenzo de Medici, in his\r\npastorals and triumphal songs: \"there is no certainty of tomorrow.\" In\r\nPulci the mocking incredulity breaks out, the bold and sensual gayety,\r\nall the audacity of the free-thinkers, who kicked aside in disgust the\r\nworn-out monkish frock of the Middle Ages. It was he who, in a jesting\r\npoem, puts at the beginning of each canto a Hosanna, an _In principio_,\r\nor a sacred text from the mass-book.[290] When he had been inquiring\r\nwhat the soul was, and how it entered the body, he compared it to jam\r\ncovered up in white bread quite hot. What would become of it in the\r\nother world? \"Some people think they will there discover becafico's,\r\nplucked ortolans, excellent wine, good beds, and therefore they follow\r\nthe monks, walking behind them. As for us, dear friend, we shall go into\r\nthe black valley, where we shall hear no more Alleluias.\" If you wish\r\nfor a more serious thinker, listen to the great patriot, the Thucydides\r\nof the age, Machiavelli, who, contrasting Christianity and paganism,\r\nsays that the first places \"supreme happiness in humility, abjection,\r\ncontempt for human things, while the other makes the sovereign good\r\nconsist in greatness of soul, force of body, and all the qualities which\r\nmake men to be feared.\" Whereon he boldly concludes that Christianity\r\nteaches man \"to support evils, and not to do great deeds\"; he discovers\r\nin that inner weakness the cause of all oppressions; declares that \"the\r\nwicked saw that they could tyrannize without fear over men, who, in\r\norder to get to paradise, were more disposed to suffer than to avenge\r\ninjuries.\" Through such sayings, in spite of his constrained\r\ngenuflexions, we can see which religion he prefers. The ideal to which\r\nall efforts were turning, on which all thoughts depended, and which\r\ncompletely raised this civilization, was the strong and happy man,\r\npossessing all the powers to accomplish his wishes, and disposed to use\r\nthem in pursuit of his happiness.\r\n\r\nIf you would see this idea in its grandest operation, you must seek it\r\nin the arts, such as Italy made them and carried throughout Europe,\r\nraising or transforming the national schools with such originality and\r\nvigor that all art likely to survive is derived from hence, and the\r\npopulation of living figures with which they have covered our walls\r\ndenotes, like Gothic architecture of French tragedy, a unique epoch of\r\nhuman intelligence. The attenuated mediæval Christ--a miserable,\r\ndistorted, and bleeding earth-worm; the pale and ugly Virgin--a poor old\r\npeasant woman, fainting beside the cross of her Son; ghastly martyrs,\r\ndried up with fasts, with entranced eyes; knotty-fingered saints with\r\nsunken chests--all the touching or lamentable visions of the Middle Ages\r\nhave vanished: the train of godheads which are now developed show\r\nnothing but flourishing frames, noble, regular features, and fine, easy\r\ngestures; the names, the names only, are Christian. The new Jesus is a\r\n\"crucified Jupiter,\" as Pulci called him; the Virgins which Raphael\r\nsketched naked, before covering them with garments,[291] are beautiful\r\ngirls, quite earthly, related to the Fornarina. The saints which Michel\r\nAngelo arranges and contorts in heaven in his picture of the Last\r\nJudgment are an assembly of athletes, capable of fighting well and\r\ndaring much. A martyrdom, like that of Saint Laurence, is a fine\r\nceremony in which a beautiful young man, without clothing, lies amidst\r\nfifty men dressed and grouped as in an ancient gymnasium. Is there one\r\nof them who had macerated himself? Is there one who had thought with\r\nanguish and tears of the judgment of God, who had worn down and subdued\r\nhis flesh, who had filled his heart with the sadness and sweetness of\r\nthe gospel? They are too vigorous for that; they are in too robust\r\nhealth; their clothes fit them too well; they are too ready for prompt\r\nand energetic action. We might make of them strong soldiers or superb\r\ncourtesans, admirable in a pageant or at a ball. So, all that the\r\nspectator accords to their halo of glory is a bow or a sign of the\r\ncross; after which his eyes find pleasure in them; they are there simply\r\nfor the enjoyment of the eyes. What the spectator feels at the sight of\r\na Florentine Madonna is the splendid creature, whose powerful body and\r\nfine growth bespeak her race and her vigor; the artist did not paint\r\nmoral expression as nowadays, the depth of a soul tortured and refined\r\nby three centuries of culture. They confine themselves to the body, to\r\nthe extent even of speaking enthusiastically of the spinal column\r\nitself, \"which is magnificent\"; of the shoulder-blades, which in the\r\nmovements of the arm \"produce an admirable effect. You will next draw\r\nthe bone which it situated between the hips. It is very fine, and is\r\ncalled the sacrum.\"[292] The important point with them is to represent\r\nthe nude well. Beauty with them is that of the complete skeleton, sinews\r\nwhich are linked together and tightened, the thighs which support the\r\ntrunk, the strong chest breathing freely, the pliant neck. What a\r\npleasure to be naked! How good it is in the full light to rejoice in a\r\nstrong body, well-formed muscles, a spirited and bold soul! The splendid\r\ngoddesses reappear in their primitive nudity, not dreaming that they are\r\nnude; you see from the tranquillity of their look, the simplicity of\r\ntheir expression, that they have always been thus, and that shame has\r\nnot yet reached them. The soul's life is not here contrasted, as amongst\r\nus, with the body's life; the one is not so lowered and degraded that we\r\ndare not show its actions and functions; they do not hide them; man does\r\nnot dream of being all spirit. They rise, as of old, from the luminous\r\nsea, with their rearing steeds tossing up their manes, champing the bit,\r\ninhaling the briny savor, whilst their companions wind the\r\nsounding-shell; and the spectators,[293] accustomed to handle the sword,\r\nto combat naked with the dagger or double-handled blade, to ride on\r\nperilous roads, sympathize with the proud shape of the bended back, the\r\neffort of the arm about to strike, the long quiver of the muscles which,\r\nfrom neck to heel, swell out, to brace a man, or to throw him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART II.--Poetry_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--Renaissance of Saxon Genius\r\n\r\n\r\nTransplanted into different races and climates, this paganism receives\r\nfrom each, distinct features and a distinct character. In England it\r\nbecomes English; the English Renaissance is the Renaissance of the Saxon\r\ngenius. Invention recommences; and to invent is to express one's genius.\r\nA Latin race can only invent by expressing Latin ideas; a Saxon race by\r\nexpressing Saxon ideas; and we shall find in the new civilization and\r\npoetry, descendants of Caedmon and Adhelm, of Piers Plowman, and Robin\r\nHood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--The Earl of Surrey\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Puttenham says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the latter end of the same king (Henry the eighth) reigne, sprong up\r\na new company of courtly makers, of whom Sir Thomas Wyat th' elder and\r\nHenry Earle of Surrey were the two chieftaines, who having travailed\r\ninto Italie, and there tasted the sweete and stately measures and stile\r\nof the Italian Poesie, as novices newly crept out of the schooles of\r\nDante, Arioste, and Petrarch, they greatly pollished our rude and homely\r\nmaner of vulgar Poesie, from that it had bene before, and for that cause\r\nmay justly be sayd the first reformers of our English meetre and\r\nstile.\"[294]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that their style was very original, or openly exhibits the new\r\nspirit: the Middle Ages is nearly ended, but not quite. By their side\r\nAndrew Borde, John Bale, John Heywood, Skelton himself, repeat the\r\nplatitudes of the old poetry and the coarseness of the old style. Their\r\nmanners, hardly refined, were still half feudal; on the field, before\r\nLandrecies, the English commander wrote a friendly letter to the French\r\ngovernor of Térouanne, to ask him \"if he had not some gentlemen\r\ndisposed to break a lance in honor of the ladies,\" and promised to send\r\nsix champions to meet them. Parades, combats, wounds, challenges, love,\r\nappeals to the judgment of God, penances--all these are found in the\r\nlife of Surrey as in a chivalric romance. A great lord, an earl, a\r\nrelative of the king, who had figured in processions and ceremonies, had\r\nmade war, commanded fortresses, ravaged countries, mounted to the\r\nassault, fallen in the breach, had been saved by his servant,\r\nmagnificent, sumptuous, irritable, ambitious, four times imprisoned,\r\nfinally beheaded. At the coronation of Anne Boleyn he wore the fourth\r\nsword; at the marriage of Anne of Cleves he was one of the challengers\r\nat the jousts. Denounced and placed in durance, he offered to fight in\r\nhis shirt against an armed adversary. Another time he was put in prison\r\nfor having eaten flesh in Lent. No wonder if this prolongation of\r\nchivalric manners brought with it a prolongation of chivalric poetry; if\r\nin an age which had known Petrarch, poets displayed the sentiments of\r\nPetrarch. Lord Berners, Sackville, Sir Thomas Wyatt, and Surrey in the\r\nfirst rank, were like Petrarch, plaintive and platonic lovers. It was\r\npure love to which Surrey gave expression; for his lady, the beautiful\r\nGeraldine, like Beatrice and Laura, was an ideal personage, and a child\r\nof thirteen years.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, amid this languor of mystical tradition, a personal feeling had\r\nsway. In this spirit which imitated, and that badly at times, which\r\nstill groped for an outlet and now and then admitted into its polished\r\nstanzas the old, simple expressions and stale metaphors of heralds of\r\narms and _trouvères_, there was already visible the Northern\r\nmelancholy, the inner and gloomy emotion. This feature, which presently,\r\nat the finest moment of its richest blossom, in the splendid\r\nexpansiveness of natural life, spreads a sombre tint over the poetry of\r\nSidney, Spenser, Shakespeare, already in the first poet separates this\r\npagan yet Teutonic world from the other, wholly voluptuous, which in\r\nItaly, with lively and refined irony, had no taste, except for art and\r\npleasure. Surrey translated the Ecclesiastes into verse. Is it not\r\nsingular, at this early hour, in this rising dawn, to find such a book\r\nin his hand? A disenchantment, a sad or bitter dreaminess, an innate\r\nconsciousness of the vanity of human things, are never lacking in this\r\ncountry and in this race; the inhabitants support life with difficulty,\r\nand know how to speak of death. Surrey's finest verses bear witness thus\r\nsoon to his serious bent, this instinctive and grave philosophy. He\r\nrecords his griefs, regretting his beloved Wyatt, his friend Clère, his\r\ncompanion the young Duke of Richmond, all dead in their prime. Alone, a\r\nprisoner at Windsor, he recalls the happy days they have passed\r\ntogether:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So cruel prison how could betide, alas,\r\nAs proud Windsor, where I in lust and joy,\r\nWith a Kinges son, my childish years did pass,\r\nIn greater feast than Priam's son of Troy.\r\n\r\n\"Where each sweet place returns a taste full sour,\r\nThe large green courts, where we were wont to hove,\r\nWith eyes cast up into the Maiden's tower,\r\nAnd easy sighs, such as folk draw in love.\r\n\r\n\"The stately seats, the ladies bright of hue,\r\nThe dances short, long tales of great delight,\r\nWith words and looks, that tigers could but rue;\r\nWhere each of us did plead the other's right.\r\n\r\n\"The palme-play, where, despoiled for the game,\r\nWith dazed eyes oft we by gleams of love\r\nHave miss'd the ball, and got sight of our dame,\r\nTo bait her eyes, which kept the leads above....\r\n\r\n\"The secret thoughts, imparted with such trust;\r\nThe wanton talk, the divers change of play;\r\nThe friendship sworn, each promise kept so just,\r\nWherewith we past the winter night away.\r\n\r\n\"And with his thought the blood forsakes the face;\r\nThe tears berain my cheeks of deadly hue:\r\nThe which, as soon as sobbing sighs, alas!\r\nUp-supped have, thus I my plaint renew:\r\n\r\n\"O place of bliss! renewer of my woes!\r\nGive me account, where is my noble fere?\r\nWhom in thy walls thou dost each night enclose;\r\nTo other lief; but unto me most dear.\r\n\r\n\"Echo, alas! that doth my sorrow rue,\r\nReturns thereto a hollow sound of plaint.\"[295]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in love, it is the sinking of a weary soul, to which he gives vent:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For all things having life, sometime hath quiet rest;\r\nThe bearing ass, the drawing ox, and every other beast;\r\nThe peasant, and the post, that serves at all assays;\r\nThe ship-boy, and the galley-slave, have time to take their ease;\r\nSave I, alas! whom care of force doth so constrain,\r\nTo wail the day, and wake the night, continually in pain,\r\nFrom pensiveness to plaint, from plaint to bitter tears,\r\nFrom tears to painful plaint again; and thus my life it wears.\"[296]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat which brings joy to others brings him grief:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings,\r\nWith green hath clad the hill, and eke the vale.\r\nThe nightingale with feathers new she sings;\r\nThe turtle to her mate hath told her tale.\r\nSummer is come, for every spray now springs;\r\nThe hart has hung his old head on the pale;\r\nThe buck in brake his winter coat he flings;\r\nThe fishes flete with new repaired scale;\r\nThe adder all her slough away she slings;\r\nThe swift swallow pursueth the flies smale;\r\nThe busy bee her honey now she mings;\r\nWinter is worn that was the flowers' bale.\r\nAnd thus I see among these pleasant things\r\nEach care decays, and yet my sorrow springs!\"[297]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all that, he will love on to his last sigh:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yea, rather die a thousand times, than once to false my faith;\r\nAnd if my feeble corpse, through weight of woful smart\r\nDo fail, or faint, my will it is that still she keep my heart.\r\nAnd when this carcass here to earth shall be refar'd,\r\nI do bequeath my wearied ghost to serve her afterward.\"[298]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn infinite love, and pure as Petrarch's; and she is worthy of it. In\r\nthe midst of all these studied or imitated verses, an admirable portrait\r\nstands out, the simplest and truest we can imagine, a work of the heart\r\nnow, and not of the memory, which behind the Madonna of chivalry shows\r\nthe English wife, and beyond feudal gallantry domestic bliss. Surrey\r\nalone, restless, hears within him the firm tones of a good friend, a\r\nsincere counsellor, Hope, who speaks to him thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For I assure thee, even by oath,\r\nAnd thereon take my hand and troth,\r\nThat she is one of the worthiest,\r\nThe truest, and the faithfullest;\r\nThe gentlest and the meekest of mind\r\nThat here on earth a man may find:\r\nAnd if that love and truth were gone,\r\nIn her it might be found alone.\r\nFor in her mind no thought there is,\r\nBut how she may be true, I wis;\r\nAnd tenders thee and all thy heale,\r\nAnd wishes both thy health and weal;\r\nAnd loves thee even as far forth than\r\nAs any woman may a man;\r\nAnd is thine own, and so she says;\r\nAnd cares for thee ten thousand ways.\r\nOf thee she speaks, on thee she thinks;\r\nWith thee she eats, with thee she drinks;\r\nWith thee she talks, with thee she moans;\r\nWith thee she sighs, with thee she groans;\r\nWith thee she says 'Farewell mine own!'\r\nWhen thou, God knows, full far art gone.\r\nAnd even, to tell thee all aright,\r\nTo thee she says full oft 'Good night!'\r\nAnd names thee oft her own most dear,\r\nHer comfort, weal, and all her cheer;\r\nAnd tells her pillow all the tale\r\nHow thou hast done her woe and bale;\r\nAnd how she longs, and plains for thee,\r\nAnd says, 'Why art thou so from me?'\r\nAm I not she that loves thee best!\r\nDo I not wish thine ease and rest?\r\nSeek I not how I may thee please?\r\nWhy art thou then so from thine ease?\r\nIf I be she for whom thou carest,\r\nFor whom in torments so thou farest,\r\nAlas! thou knowest to find me here,\r\nWhere I remain thine own most dear.\r\nThine own most true, thine own most just,\r\nThine own that loves thee still, and must;\r\nThine own that cares alone for thee,\r\nAs thou, I think, dost care for me;\r\nAnd even the woman, she alone,\r\nThat is full bent to be thine own.\"[299]\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly it is of his wife[300] that he is thinking here, not of an\r\nimaginary Laura. The poetic dream of Petrarch has become the exact\r\npicture of deep and perfect conjugal affection, such as yet survives in\r\nEngland; such as all the poets, from the authoress of the \"Nutbrown\r\nMaid\" to Dickens,[301] have never failed to represent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Surrey's Style\r\n\r\n\r\nAn English Petrarch: no juster title could be given to Surrey, for it\r\nexpresses his talent as well as his disposition. In fact, like Petrarch,\r\nthe oldest of the humanists, and the earliest exact writer of the modern\r\ntongue, Surrey introduces a new style, the manly style, which marks a\r\ngreat change of the mind; for this new form of writing is the result of\r\nsuperior reflection, which, governing the primitive impulse, calculates\r\nand selects with an end in view. At last the intellect has grown capable\r\nof self-criticism, and actually criticises itself. It corrects its\r\nunconsidered works, infantine and incoherent, at once incomplete and\r\nsuperabundant; it strengthens and binds them together; it prunes and\r\nperfects them; it takes from them the master idea, to set it free and to\r\nshow it clearly. This is what Surrey does, and his education had\r\nprepared him for it; for he had studied Vergil as well as Petrarch, and\r\ntranslated two books of the Æneid, almost verse for verse. In such\r\ncompany a man cannot but select his ideas and connect his phrases. After\r\ntheir example, Surrey gauges the means of striking the attention,\r\nassisting the intelligence, avoiding fatigue and weariness. He looks\r\nforward to the last line whilst writing the first. He keeps the\r\nstrongest word for the last, and shows the symmetry of ideas by the\r\nsymmetry of phrases. Sometimes he guides the intelligence by a\r\ncontinuous series of contrasts to the final image; a kind of sparkling\r\ncasket, in which he means to deposit the idea which he carries, and to\r\nwhich he directs our attention from the first.[302] Sometimes he leads\r\nhis reader to the close of a long flowery description, and then suddenly\r\nchecks him with a sorrowful phrase.[303] He arranges his process, and\r\nknows how to produce effects; he uses even classical expressions, in\r\nwhich two substantives, each supported by its adjective, are balanced on\r\neither side of the verb.[304] He collects his phrases in harmonious\r\nperiods, and does not neglect the delight of the ears any more than of\r\nthe mind. By his inversions he adds force to his ideas, and weight to\r\nhis argument. He selects elegant or noble terms, rejects idle words and\r\nredundant phrases. Every epithet contains an idea, every metaphor a\r\nsentiment. There is eloquence in the regular development of his thought;\r\nmusic in the sustained accent of his verse.\r\n\r\nSuch is the new-born art. Those who have ideas, now possess an\r\ninstrument capable of expressing them. Like the Italian painters, who in\r\nfifty years had introduced or discovered all the technical tricks of the\r\nbrush, English writers, in half a century, introduce or discover all the\r\nartifices of language, period, elevated style, heroic verse, soon the\r\ngrand stanza, so effectually, that a little later the most perfect\r\nversifiers, Dryden, and Pope himself, says Dr. Nott, will add scarce\r\nanything to the rules, invented or applied, which were employed in the\r\nearliest efforts.[305] Even Surrey is too near to these authors, too\r\nconstrained in his models, not sufficiently free; he has not yet felt\r\nthe fiery blast of the age; we do not find in him a bold genius, an\r\nimpassioned writer capable of wide expansion, but a courtier, a lover of\r\nelegance, who, penetrated by the beauties of two finished literatures,\r\nimitates Horace and the chosen masters of Italy, corrects and polishes\r\nlittle morsels, aims at speaking perfectly fine language. Amongst\r\nsemi-barbarians he wears a full dress becomingly. Yet he does not wear\r\nit completely at his ease: he keeps his eyes too exclusively on his\r\nmodels, and does not venture on frank and free gestures. He is sometimes\r\nas a school-boy, makes too great use of \"hot\" and \"cold,\" wounds and\r\nmartyrdom. Although a lover, and a genuine one, he thinks too much that\r\nhe must be so in Petrarch's manner, that his phrase must be balanced and\r\nhis image kept up. I had almost said that, in his sonnets of\r\ndisappointed love, he thinks less often of the strength of love than of\r\nthe beauty of his writing. He has conceits, ill-chosen words; he uses\r\ntrite expressions; he relates how Nature, having formed his lady, broke\r\nthe mould, he assigns parts to Cupid and Venus; he employs the old\r\nmachinery of the troubadours and the ancients, like a clever man who\r\nwishes to pass for a gallant. At first scarce any mind dares be quite\r\nitself: when a new art arises, the first artist listens not to his\r\nheart, but to his masters, and asks himself at every step whether he be\r\nsetting foot on solid ground, or whether he is not stumbling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Development of Artistic Ideas\r\n\r\n\r\nInsensibly the growth became complete, and at the end of the century all\r\nwas changed. A new, strange, overloaded style had been formed, destined\r\nto remain in force until the Restoration, not only in poetry, but also\r\nin prose, even in ceremonial speech and theological discourse,[306] so\r\nsuitable to the spirit of the age that we meet with it at the same time\r\nthroughout the world of Europe, in Ronsard and d'Aubigné, in Calderon,\r\nGongora, and Marini. In 1580 appeared \"Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit,\" by\r\nLyly, which was its text-book, its masterpiece, its caricature, and was\r\nreceived with universal admiration.[307] \"Our nation,\" says Edward\r\nBlount, \"are in his debt for a new English which hee taught them. All\r\nour ladies were then his scollers; and that beautie in court who could\r\nnot parley Euphuesme was as little regarded as shee which now there\r\nspeakes not French.\" The ladies knew the phrases of Euphues by heart:\r\nstrange, studied, and refined phrases, enigmatical; whose author seems\r\nof set purpose to seek the least natural expressions and the most\r\nfarfetched, full of exaggeration and antithesis, in which mythological\r\nallusions, reminiscences from alchemy, botanical and astronomical\r\nmetaphors, all the rubbish and medley of learning, travels, mannerism,\r\nroll in a flood of conceits and comparisons. Do not judge it by the\r\ngrotesque picture that Walter Scott drew of it. Sir Piercie Shafton is\r\nbut a pedant, a cold and dull copyist; it is its warmth and originality\r\nwhich give this style a true force and an accent of its own. You must\r\nconceive it, not as dead and inert, such as we have it to-day in old\r\nbooks, but springing from the lips of ladies and young lords in\r\npearl-bedecked doublet, quickened by their vibrating voices, their\r\nlaughter, the flash of their eyes, the motion of their hands as they\r\nplayed with the hilt of their swords or with their satin cloaks. They\r\nwere full of life, their heads filled to overflowing; and they amused\r\nthemselves, as our sensitive and eager artists do, at their ease in the\r\nstudio. They did not speak to convince or be understood, but to satisfy\r\ntheir excited imagination, to expend their overflowing wit.[308] They\r\nplayed with words, twisted, put them out of shape, enjoyed sudden views,\r\nstrong contrasts, which they produced one after another, ever and anon,\r\nand in great quantities. They cast flower on flower, tinsel on tinsel:\r\neverything sparkling delighted them; they gilded and embroidered and\r\nplumed their language like their garments. They cared nothing for\r\nclearness, order, common-sense; it was a festival of madness; absurdity\r\npleased them. They knew nothing more tempting than a carnival of\r\nsplendors and oddities; all was huddled together: a coarse gayety, a\r\ntender and sad word, a pastoral, a sounding flourish of unmeasured\r\nboasting, a gambol of a Jack-pudding. Eyes, ears, all the senses, eager\r\nand excited, are satisfied by this jingle of syllables, the display of\r\nfine high-colored words, the unexpected clash of droll or familiar\r\nimages, the majestic roll of well-poised periods. Every one had his own\r\noaths, his elegances, his style. \"One would say,\" remarks Heylyn, \"that\r\nthey are ashamed of their mother-tongue, and do not find it sufficiently\r\nvaried to express the whims of their mind.\" We no longer imagine this\r\ninventiveness, this boldness of fancy, this ceaseless fertility of\r\nnervous sensibility: there was no genuine prose at that time; the poetic\r\nflood swallowed it up. A word was not an exact symbol, as with us; a\r\ndocument which from cabinet to cabinet carried a precise thought. It was\r\npart of a complete action, a little drama; when they read it they did\r\nnot take it by itself, but imagined it with the intonation of a hissing\r\nand shrill voice, with the puckering of the lips, the knitting of the\r\nbrows, and the succession of pictures which crowd behind it, and which\r\nit calls forth in a flash of lightning. Each one mimics and pronounces\r\nit in his own style, and impresses his own soul upon it. It was a song,\r\nwhich like the poet's verse, contains a thousand things besides the\r\nliteral sense, and manifests the depth, warmth, and sparkling of the\r\nsource whence it flowed. For in that time, even when the man was feeble,\r\nhis work lived; there is some pulse in the least productions of this\r\nage; force and creative fire signalize it; they penetrate through\r\nbombast and affectation. Lyly himself, so fantastic that he seems to\r\nwrite purposely in defiance of common-sense, is at times a genuine poet;\r\na singer, a man capable of rapture, akin to Spenser and Shakespeare; one\r\nof those introspective dreamers who see dancing fairies, the purpled\r\ncheeks of goddesses, drunken, amorous woods, as he says\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Adorned with the presence of my love,\r\nThe woods I fear such secret power shall prove,\r\nAs they'll shut up each path, hide every way,\r\nBecause they still would have her go astray.\"[309]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader must assist me, and assist himself. I cannot otherwise give\r\nhim to understand what the men of this age had the felicity to\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nLuxuriance and irregularity were the two features of this spirit and\r\nthis literature--features common to all the literatures of the\r\nRenaissance, but more marked here than elsewhere, because the German\r\nrace is not confined, like the Latin, by the taste for harmonious forms,\r\nand prefers strong impression to fine expression. We must select amidst\r\nthis crowd of poets; and here is one amongst the first, who exhibits, by\r\nhis writings as well as by his life, the greatness and the folly of the\r\nprevailing manners and the public taste: Sir Philip Sidney, nephew of\r\nthe Earl of Leicester, a great lord and a man of action, accomplished in\r\nevery kind of culture; who, after a good training in classical\r\nliterature, travelled in France, Germany, and Italy; read Plato and\r\nAristotle, studied astronomy and geometry at Venice; pondered over the\r\nGreek tragedies, the Italian sonnets, the pastorals of Montemayor, the\r\npoems of Ronsard; displaying an interest in science, keeping up an\r\nexchange of letters with the learned Hubert Languet; and withal a man of\r\nthe world, a favorite of Elizabeth, having had enacted in her honor a\r\nflattering and comic pastoral; a genuine \"jewel of the court\"; a judge,\r\nlike d'Urfé, of lofty gallantry and fine language; above all,\r\nchivalrous in heart and deed, who wished to follow maritime adventure\r\nwith Drake, and, to crown all, fated to die an early and heroic death.\r\nHe was a cavalry officer, and had saved the English army at Gravelines.\r\nShortly after, mortally wounded, and dying of thirst, as some water was\r\nbrought to him, he saw by his side a soldier still more desperately\r\nhurt, who was looking at the water with anguish in his face: \"Give it to\r\nthis man,\" said he; \"his necessity is still greater than mine.\" Do not\r\nforget the vehemence and impetuosity of the Middle Ages; one hand ready\r\nfor action, and kept incessantly on the hilt of the sword or poniard.\r\n\"Mr. Molineux,\" wrote he to his father's secretary, \"if ever I know you\r\nto do so much as read any letter I write to my father, without his\r\ncommandment or my consent, I will thrust my dagger into you. And trust\r\nto it, for I speak it in earnest.\" It was the same man who said to his\r\nuncle's adversaries that they \"lied in their throat\"; and to support his\r\nwords, promised them a meeting in three months in any place in Europe.\r\nThe savage energy of the preceding age remains intact, and it is for\r\nthis reason that poetry took so firm a hold on these virgin souls. The\r\nhuman harvest is never so fine as when cultivation opens up a new soil.\r\nImpassioned, moreover, melancholy and solitary, he naturally turned to\r\nnoble and ardent fantasy; and he was so much the poet that he had no\r\nneed of verse.\r\n\r\nShall I describe his pastoral epic, the \"Arcadia\"? It is but a\r\nrecreation, a sort of poetical romance, written in the country for the\r\namusement of his sister; a work of fashion, which, like \"Cyrus\" and\r\n\"Clélie,\"[310] is not a monument, but a document. This kind of books\r\nshows only the externals, the current elegance and politeness, the\r\njargon of the fashionable world--in short, that which should be spoken\r\nbefore ladies; and yet we perceive from it the bent of the public\r\nopinion. In \"Clélie,\" oratorical development, delicate and collected\r\nanalysis, the flowing converse of men seated quietly in elegant\r\narm-chairs; in the \"Arcadia,\" fantastic imagination, excessive\r\nsentiment, a medley of events which suited men scarcely recovered from\r\nbarbarism. Indeed, in London they still used to fire pistols at each\r\nother in the streets; and under Henry VIII and his children, Queens, a\r\nProtector, the highest nobles, knelt under the axe of the executioner.\r\nArmed and perilous existence long resisted in Europe the establishment\r\nof peaceful and quiet life. It was necessary to change society and the\r\nsoil, in order to transform men of the sword into citizens. The high\r\nroads of Louis XIV and his regular administration, and more recently the\r\nrailroads and the _sergents de ville_, freed the French from habits of\r\nviolence and a taste for dangerous adventure. Remember that at this\r\nperiod men's heads were full of tragical images. Sidney's \"Arcadia\"\r\ncontains enough of them to supply half a dozen epics. \"It is a trifle,\"\r\nsays the author; \"my young head must be delivered.\" In the first\r\ntwenty-five pages you meet with a shipwreck, an account of pirates, a\r\nhalf-drowned prince rescued by shepherds, a journey in Arcadia, various\r\ndisguises, the retreat of a king withdrawn into solitude with his wife\r\nand children, the deliverance of a young imprisoned lord, a war against\r\nthe Helots, the conclusion of peace, and many other things. Read on, and\r\nyou will find princesses shut up by a wicked fairy, who beats them, and\r\nthreatens them with death if they refuse to marry her son; a beautiful\r\nqueen condemned to perish by fire if certain knights do not come to her\r\nsuccor; a treacherous prince tortured for his wicked deeds, then cast\r\nfrom the top of a pyramid; fights, surprises, abductions, travels: in\r\nshort, the whole programme of the most romantic tales. That is the\r\nserious element: the agreeable is of a like nature; the fantastic\r\npredominates. Improbable pastoral serves, as in Shakespeare or Lope de\r\nVega, for an intermezzo to improbable tragedy. You are always coming\r\nupon dancing shepherds. They are very courteous, good poets, and subtle\r\nmetaphysicians. Several of them are disguised princes who pay their\r\ncourt to the princesses. They sing continually, and get up allegorical\r\ndances; two bands approach, servants of Reason and Passion; their hats,\r\nribbons, and dress are described in full. They quarrel in verse, and\r\ntheir retorts, which follow close on one another, over-refined, keep up\r\na tournament of wit. Who cared for what was natural or possible in this\r\nage? There were such festivals at Elizabeth's \"progresses\"; and you have\r\nonly to look at the engravings of Sadeler, Martin de Vos, and Goltzius,\r\nto find this mixture of sensitive beauties and philosophical enigmas.\r\nThe Countess of Pembroke and her ladies were delighted to picture this\r\nprofusion of costumes and verses, this play beneath the trees. They had\r\neyes in the sixteenth century, senses which sought satisfaction in\r\npoetry--the same satisfaction as in masquerading and painting. Man was\r\nnot yet a pure reasoner; abstract truth was not enough for him. Rich\r\nstuffs, twisted about and folded; the sun to shine upon them, a large\r\nmeadow studded with white daisies; ladies in brocaded dresses, with bare\r\narms, crowns on their heads, instruments of music behind the trees--this\r\nis what the reader expects; he cares nothing for contrasts; he will\r\nreadily accept a drawing-room in the midst of the fields.\r\n\r\nWhat are they going to say there? Here comes out that nervous\r\nexaltation, in all its folly, which is characteristic of the spirit of\r\nthe age; love rises to the thirty-sixth heaven. Musidorus is the brother\r\nof Céladon; Pamela is closely related to the severe heroines of\r\n\"Astrée\";[311] all the Spanish exaggerations abound and all the Spanish\r\nfalsehoods. For in these works of fashion or of the Court, primitive\r\nsentiment never retains its sincerity: wit, the necessity to please, the\r\ndesire for effect, of speaking better than others, alter it, influence\r\nit, heap up embellishments and refinements, so that nothing is left but\r\ntwaddle. Musidorus wished to give Pamela a kiss. She repels him. He\r\nwould have died on the spot; but luckily remembers that his mistress\r\ncommanded him to leave her, and finds himself still able to obey her\r\ncommand. He complains to the trees, weeps in verse: there are dialogues\r\nwhere Echo, repeating the last word, replies; duets in rhyme, balanced\r\nstanzas, in which the theory of love is minutely detailed; in short, all\r\nthe grand airs of ornamental poetry. If they send a letter to their\r\nmistress, they speak to it, tell the ink: \"Therfore mourne boldly, my\r\ninke; for while shee lookes upon you, your blacknesse will shine: cry\r\nout boldly my lamentation; for while shee reades you, your cries will be\r\nmusicke.\"[312]\r\n\r\nAgain, two young princesses are going to bed: \"They impoverished their\r\nclothes to enrich their bed, which for that night might well scorne the\r\nshrine of Venus; and there cherishing one another with deare, though\r\nchaste embracements; with sweete, though cold kisses; it might seeme\r\nthat love was come to play him there without dart, or that wearie of his\r\nowne fires, he was there to refresh himselfe betwen their sweete\r\nbreathing lippes.\"[313]\r\n\r\nIn excuse of these follies, remember that they have their parallels in\r\nShakespeare. Try rather to comprehend them, to imagine them in their\r\nplace, with their surroundings, such as they are; that is, as the excess\r\nof singularity and inventive fire. Even though they mar now and then the\r\nfinest ideas, yet a natural freshness pierces through the disguise. Take\r\nanother example: \"In the time that the morning did strew roses and\r\nviolets in the heavenly floore against the coming of the sun, the\r\nnightingales (striving one with the other which could in most dainty\r\nvarietie recount their wronge-caused sorrow) made them put off their\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sidney's second work, \"The Defence of Poesie,\" we meet with genuine\r\nimagination, a sincere and serious tone, a grand, commanding style, all\r\nthe passion and elevation which he carries in his heart and puts into\r\nhis verse. He is a muser, a Platonist, who is penetrated by the\r\ndoctrines of the ancients, who takes things from a lofty point of view,\r\nwho places the excellence of poetry not in pleasing effect, imitation,\r\nor rhyme, but in that creative and superior conception by which the\r\nartist creates anew and embellishes nature. At the same time, he is an\r\nardent man, trusting in the nobleness of his aspirations and in the\r\nwidth of his ideas, who puts down the brawling of the shoppy, narrow,\r\nvulgar Puritanism, and glows with the lofty irony, the proud freedom, of\r\na poet and a lord.\r\n\r\nIn his eyes, if there is any art or science capable of augmenting and\r\ncultivating our generosity, it is poetry. He draws comparison after\r\ncomparison between it and philosophy or history, whose pretensions he\r\nlaughs at and dismisses.[314] He fights for poetry as a knight for his\r\nlady, and in what heroic and splendid style! He says: \"I never heard the\r\nold Song of Percie and Douglas, that I found not my heart moved more\r\nthan with a trumpet: and yet it is sung but by some blinde Crowder, with\r\nno rougher voyce, than rude stile; which beeing so evill apparelled in\r\nthe dust and Cobweb of that uncivil age, what would it work, trimmed in\r\nthe gorgeous eloquence of Pindare?\"[315]\r\n\r\nThe philosopher repels, the poet attracts: \"Nay hee doth as if your\r\njourney should lye through a faire vineyard, at the very first, give you\r\na cluster of grapes, that full of that taste, you may long to passe\r\nfurther.\"[316]\r\n\r\nWhat description of poetry can displease you? Not pastoral so easy and\r\ngenial? \"Is it the bitter but wholesome Iambicke, who rubbes the galled\r\nminde, making shame the Trumpet of villanie, with bold and open crying\r\nout against naughtinesse?\"[317]\r\n\r\nAt the close he reviews his arguments, and the vibrating martial accent\r\nof his political period is like a trump of victory: \"So that since the\r\nexcellencies of it (poetry) may bee so easily and so justly confirmed,\r\nand the low-creeping objections so soone trodden downe, it not being an\r\nArt of lyes, but of true doctrine: not of effeminatenesse, but of\r\nnotable stirring of courage; not of abusing man's wit, but of\r\nstrengthening man's wit; not banished, but honoured by Plato; let us\r\nrather plant more Laurels for to ingarland the Poets heads than suffer\r\nthe ill-savoured breath of such wrong speakers, once to blow upon the\r\ncleare springs of Poesie.\"[318]\r\n\r\nFrom such vehemence and gravity you may anticipate what his verses will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nOften, after reading the poets of this age, I have looked for some time\r\nat the contemporary prints, telling myself that man, in mind and body,\r\nwas not then such as we see him to-day. We also have our passions, but\r\nwe are no longer strong enough to bear them. They unsettle us; we are no\r\nlonger poets without suffering for it. Alfred de Musset, Heine, Edgar\r\nPoe, Burns, Byron, Shelley, Cowper, how many shall I instance? Disgust,\r\nmental and bodily degradation, disease, impotence, madness, suicide, at\r\nbest a permanent hallucination or feverish raving--these are nowadays\r\nthe ordinary issues of the poetic temperament. The passion of the brain\r\ngnaws our vitals, dries up the blood, eats into the marrow, shakes us\r\nlike a tempest, and the human frame, such as civilization has made us,\r\nis not substantial enough long to resist it. They, who have been more\r\nroughly trained, who are more inured to the inclemencies of climate,\r\nmore hardened by bodily exercise, more firm against danger, endure and\r\nlive. Is there a man living who could withstand the storm of passions\r\nand visions which swept over Shakespeare, and end, like him, as a\r\nsensible citizen and landed proprietor in his small county? The muscles\r\nwere firmer, despair less prompt. The rage of concentrated attention,\r\nthe half hallucinations, the anguish and heaving of the breast, the\r\nquivering of the limbs bracing themselves involuntarily and blindly for\r\naction, all the painful yearnings which accompany grand desires,\r\nexhausted them less; this is why they desired longer, and dared more.\r\nD'Aubigné, wounded with many sword-thrusts, conceiving death at hand,\r\nhad himself bound on his horse that he might see his mistress once more,\r\nand rode thus several leagues, losing blood all the way, and arriving in\r\na swoon. Such feelings we glean still from their portraits, in the\r\nstraight looks which pierce like a sword; in that strength of back, bent\r\nor twisted; in the sensuality, energy, enthusiasm, which breathe from\r\ntheir attitude or look. Such feelings we still discover in their poetry,\r\nin Greene, Lodge, Jonson, Spenser, Shakespeare, in Sidney, as in all the\r\nrest. We quickly forget the faults of taste which accompany them, the\r\naffectation, the uncouth jargon. Is it really so uncouth? Imagine a man\r\nwho with closed eyes distinctly sees the adored countenance of his\r\nmistress, who keeps it before him all the day; who is troubled and\r\nshaken as he imagines ever and anon her brow, her lips, her eyes; who\r\ncannot and will not be separated from his vision; who sinks daily deeper\r\nin this passionate contemplation; who is every instant crushed by mortal\r\nanxieties, or transported by the raptures of bliss: he will lose the\r\nexact conception of objects. A fixed idea becomes a false idea. By dint\r\nof regarding an object under all its forms, turning it over, piercing\r\nthrough it, we at last deform it. When we cannot think of a thing\r\nwithout being dazed and without tears, we magnify it, and give it a\r\ncharacter which it has not. Hence strange comparisons, over-refined\r\nideas, excessive images, become natural. However far Sidney goes,\r\nwhatever object he touches, he sees throughout the universe only the\r\nname and features of Stella. All ideas bring him back to her. He is\r\ndrawn ever and invincibly by the same thought: and comparisons which\r\nseem farfetched, only express the unfailing presence and sovereign power\r\nof the besetting image. Stella is ill; it seems to Sidney that \"Joy,\r\nwhich is inseparate from those eyes, Stella, now learnes (strange case)\r\nto weepe in thee.\"[319] To us, the expression is absurd. Is it so for\r\nSidney, who for hours together had dwelt on the expression of those\r\neyes, seeing in them at last all the beauties of heaven and earth, who,\r\ncompared to them, finds all light dull and all happiness stale? Consider\r\nthat in every extreme passion ordinary laws are reversed, that our logic\r\ncannot pass judgment on it, that we find in it affectation,\r\nchildishness, witticisms, crudity, folly, and that to us violent\r\nconditions of the nervous machine are like an unknown and marvellous\r\nland, where common-sense and good language cannot penetrate. On the\r\nreturn of spring, when May spreads over the fields her dappled dress of\r\nnew flowers, Astrophel and Stella sit in the shade of a retired grove,\r\nin the warm air, full of birds' voices and pleasant exhalations. Heaven\r\nsmiles, the wind kisses the trembling leaves, the inclining trees\r\ninterlace their sappy branches, amorous earth swallows greedily the\r\nrippling water:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In a grove most rich of shade,\r\nWhere birds wanton musike made,\r\nMay, then yong, his py'd weeds showing,\r\nNew perfum'd with flowers fresh growing,\r\n\r\n\"Astrophel with Stella sweet,\r\nDid for mutuall comfort meet,\r\nBoth within themselves oppressed,\r\nBut each in the other blessed....\r\n\r\n\"Their eares hungry of each word,\r\nWhich the deere tongue would afford,\r\nBut their tongues restrain'd from walking,\r\nTill their hearts had ended talking.\r\n\r\n\"But when their tongues could not speake,\r\nLove it selfe did silence breake;\r\nLove did set his lips asunder,\r\nThus to speake in love and wonder....\r\n\r\n\"This small winde which so sweet is,\r\nSee how it the leaves doth kisse,\r\nEach tree in his best attyring,\r\nSense of love to love inspiring.\"[320]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his knees, with beating heart, oppressed, it seems to him that his\r\nmistress becomes transformed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Stella, soveraigne of my joy,...\r\nStella, starre of heavenly fire,\r\nStella, load-starre of desire,\r\nStella, in whose shining eyes\r\nAre the lights of Cupid's skies....\r\nStella, whose voice when it speakes\r\nSenses all asunder breakes;\r\nStella, whose voice when it singeth,\r\nAngels to acquaintance bringeth.\"[321]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese cries of adoration are like a hymn. Every day he writes thoughts\r\nof love which agitate him, and in this long journal of a hundred pages\r\nwe feel the heated breath swell each moment. A smile from his mistress,\r\na curl lifted by the wind, a gesture--all are events. He paints her in\r\nevery attitude; he cannot see her too constantly. He talks to the birds,\r\nplants, winds, all nature. He brings the whole world to Stella's feet.\r\nAt the notion of a kiss he swoons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thinke of that most gratefull time,\r\nWhen thy leaping heart will climbe,\r\nIn my lips to have his biding.\r\nThere those roses for to kisse,\r\nWhich doe breath a sugred blisse,\r\nOpening rubies, pearles dividing.\"[322]\r\n\r\n\"O joy, too high for my low stile to show:\r\nO blisse, fit for a nobler state than me:\r\nEnvie, put out thine eyes, lest thou do see\r\nWhat Oceans of delight in me do flow.\r\nMy friend, that oft saw through all maskes my wo,\r\nCome, come, and let me powre my selfe on thee;\r\nGone is the winter of my miserie,\r\nMy spring appeares, O see what here doth grow,\r\nFor Stella hath with words where faith doth shine,\r\nOf her high heart giv'n me the monarchie:\r\nI, I, O I may say that she is mine.\"[323]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are Oriental splendors in the dazzling sonnet in which he asks why\r\nStella's cheeks have grown pale:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where be those Roses gone, which sweetned so our eyes?\r\nWhere those red cheekes, with oft with faire encrease doth frame\r\nThe height of honour in the kindly badge of shame?\r\nWho hath the crimson weeds stolne from my morning skies?\"[324]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he says, his \"life melts with too much thinking.\" Exhausted by\r\necstasy, he pauses; then he flies from thought to thought, seeking\r\nrelief for his wound, like the Satyr whom he describes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Prometheus, when first from heaven hie\r\nHe brought downe fire, ere then on earth not seene,\r\nFond of delight, a Satyr standing by,\r\nGave it a kisse, as it like sweet had beene.\r\n\r\n\"Feeling forthwith the other burning power,\r\nWood with the smart with showts and shryking shrill,\r\nHe sought his ease in river, field, and bower,\r\nBut for the time his griefe went with him still.\"[325]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last calm returned; and whilst this calm lasts, the lively, glowing\r\nspirit plays like a flickering flame on the surface of the deep brooding\r\nfire. His love-songs and word-portraits, delightful pagan and chivalric\r\nfancies, seem to be inspired by Petrarch or Plato. We feel the charm and\r\nsportiveness under the seeming affectation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Faire eyes, sweete lips, deare heart, that foolish I\r\nCould hope by Cupids helpe on you to pray;\r\nSince to himselfe he doth your gifts apply,\r\nAs his maine force, choise sport, and easefull stray.\r\n\r\n\"For when he will see who dare him gainsay,\r\nThen with those eyes he lookes, lo by and by\r\nEach soule doth at Loves feet his weapons lay,\r\nGlad if for her he give them leave to die.\r\n\r\n\"When he will play, then in her lips he is,\r\nWhere blushing red, that Loves selfe them doth love,\r\nWith either lip he doth the other kisse:\r\nBut when he will for quiets sake remove\r\nFrom all the world, her heart is then his rome,\r\nWhere well he knowes, no man to him can come.\"[326]\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth heart and sense are captive here. If he finds the eyes of Stella\r\nmore beautiful than anything in the world, he finds her soul more lovely\r\nthan her body. He is a Platonist when he recounts how Virtue, wishing to\r\nbe loved of men, took Stella's form to enchant their eyes, and make them\r\nsee the heaven which the inner sense reveals to heroic souls. We\r\nrecognize in him that entire submission of heart, love turned into a\r\nreligion, perfect passion which asks only to grow, and which, like the\r\npiety of the mystics, finds itself always too insignificant when it\r\ncompares itself with the object loved:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My youth doth waste, my knowledge brings forth toyes,\r\nMy wit doth strive those passions to defend,\r\nWhich for reward spoyle it with vaine annoyes,\r\nI see my course to lose my selfe doth bend:\r\nI see and yet no greater sorrow take,\r\nThan that I lose no more for Stella's sake.\"[327]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, like Socrates in the banquet, he turns his eyes to deathless\r\nbeauty, heavenly brightness:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust,\r\nAnd thou my minde aspire to higher things:\r\nGrow rich in that which never taketh rust:\r\nWhatever fades, but fading pleasure brings....\r\nO take fast hold, let that light be thy guide,\r\nIn this small course which birth drawes out to death.\"[328]\r\n\r\n\r\nDivine love continues the earthly love; he was imprisoned in this, and\r\nfrees himself. By this nobility, these lofty aspirations, recognize one\r\nof those serious souls of which there are so many in the same climate\r\nand race. Spiritual instincts pierce through the dominant paganism, and\r\nere they make Christians, make Platonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--Wherein Lies the Strength of the Poetry of this Period\r\n\r\n\r\nSidney was only a soldier in an army; there is a multitude about him, a\r\nmultitude of poets. In fifty-two years, without counting the drama, two\r\nhundred and thirty-three are enumerated,[329] of whom forty have genius\r\nor talent: Breton, Donne, Drayton, Lodge, Greene, the two Fletchers,\r\nBeaumont, Spenser, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Marlowe, Wither, Warner,\r\nDavison, Carew, Suckling, Herrick; we should grow tired in counting\r\nthem. There is a crop of them, and so there is at the same time in\r\nCatholic and heroic Spain; and as in Spain it was a sign of the times,\r\nthe mark of a public want, the index to an extraordinary and transient\r\ncondition of the mind. What is this condition which gives rise to so\r\nuniversal a taste for poetry? What is it breathes life into their books?\r\nHow happens it that amongst the least, in spite of pedantries,\r\nawkwardnesses, in the rhyming chronicles or descriptive cyclopedias, we\r\nmeet with brilliant pictures and genuine love-cries? How happens it that\r\nwhen this generation was exhausted, true poetry ended in England, as\r\ntrue painting in Italy and Flanders? It was because an epoch of the mind\r\ncame and passed away--that, namely, of instinctive and creative\r\nconception. These men had new senses, and no theories in their heads.\r\nThus, when they took a walk, their emotions were not the same as ours.\r\nWhat is sunrise to an ordinary man? A white smudge on the edge of the\r\nsky, between bosses of clouds, amid pieces of land, and bits of road,\r\nwhich he does not see because he has seen them a hundred times. But for\r\nthem, all things have a soul; I mean that they feel within themselves,\r\nindirectly, the uprising and severance of the outlines, the power and\r\ncontrast of tints, the sad or delicious sentiment, which breathes from\r\nthis combination and union like a harmony or a cry. How sorrowful is the\r\nsun, as he rises in a mist above the sad sea-furrows; what an air of\r\nresignation in the old trees rustling in the night rain; what a feverish\r\ntumult in the mass of waves, whose dishevelled locks are twisted forever\r\non the surface of the abyss! But the great torch of heaven, the luminous\r\ngod, emerges and shines; the tall, soft, pliant herbs, the evergreen\r\nmeadows, the expanding roof of lofty oaks--the whole English landscape,\r\ncontinually renewed and illumined by the flooding moisture, diffuses an\r\ninexhaustible freshness. These meadows, red and white with flowers, ever\r\nmoist and ever young, slip off their veil of golden mist, and appear\r\nsuddenly, timidly, like beautiful virgins. Here is the cuckoo-flower,\r\nwhich springs up before the coming of the swallow; there the hare-bell,\r\nblue as the veins of a woman; the marigold, which sets with the sun,\r\nand, weeping, rises with him. Drayton, in his \"Polyolbion,\" sings\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then from her burnisht gate the goodly glittring East\r\nGuilds every lofty top, which late the humorous Night\r\nBespangled had with pearle, to please the Mornings sight;\r\nOn which the mirthfull Quires, with their cleere open throats,\r\nUnto the joyfull Morne so straine their warbling notes,\r\nThat Hills and Valleys ring, and even the ecchoing Ayre\r\nSeemes all compos'd of sounds, about them everywhere....\r\nThus sing away the Morne, untill the mounting Sunne,\r\nThrough thick exhaled fogs, his golden head hath runne,\r\nAnd through the twisted tops of our close Covert creeps,\r\nTo kiss the gentle Shade, this while that sweetly sleeps.\"[330]\r\n\r\n\r\nA step further, and you will find the old gods reappear. They reappear,\r\nthese living gods--these living gods mingled with things which you\r\ncannot help meeting as soon as you meet nature again. Shakespeare, in\r\nthe \"Tempest,\" sings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ceres, most bounteous lady thy rich leas\r\nOf wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;\r\nThy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\r\nAnd flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;\r\nThy banks with peoned and lilied brims,\r\nWhich spongy April at thy hest betrims,\r\nTo make cold nymphs chaste crowns...\r\nHail, many-colour'd messenger (Iris)...\r\nWho, with thy saffron wings, upon my flowers\r\nDiffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,\r\nAnd with each end of thy blue bow dost crown\r\nMy bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down.\"[331]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn \"Cymbeline\" he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They are as gentle as zephyrs, blowing below the violet.\r\nNot wagging his sweet head.\"[332]\r\n\r\n\r\nGreene writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When Flora, proud in pomp of all her flowers,\r\nSat bright and gay,\r\nAnd gloried in the dew of Iris' showers,\r\nAnd did display\r\nHer mantle chequered all with gaudy green.\"[333]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same author also says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How oft have I descending Titan seen,\r\nHis burning locks couch in the sea-queen's lap;\r\nAnd beauteous Thetis his red body wrap\r\nIn watery robes, as he her lord had been!\"[334]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Spenser, in his \"Faërie Queene,\" sings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The joyous day gan early to appeare;\r\nAnd fayre Aurora from the deawy bed\r\nOf aged Tithone gan herselfe to reare\r\nWith rosy cheekes, for shame as blushing red:\r\nHer golden locks, for hast, were loosely shed\r\nAbout her eares, when Una her did marke\r\nClymbe to her charet, all with flowers spred,\r\nFrom heven high to chace the chearelesse darke;\r\nWith mery note her lowd salutes the mounting larke.\"[335]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the splendor and sweetness of this moist and well-watered land; all\r\nthe specialties, the opulence of its dissolving tints, of its variable\r\nsky, its luxuriant vegetation, assemble thus about the gods, who gave\r\nthem their beautiful form.\r\n\r\nIn the life of every man there are moments when, in presence of objects,\r\nhe experiences a shock. This mass of ideas, of mangled recollections, of\r\nmutilated images, which lie hidden in all corners of his mind, are set\r\nin motion, organized, suddenly developed like a flower. He is\r\nenraptured; he cannot help looking at and admiring the charming creature\r\nwhich has just appeared; he wishes to see it again, and others like it,\r\nand dreams of nothing else. There are such moments in the life of\r\nnations, and this is one of them. They are happy in contemplating\r\nbeautiful things, and wish only that they should be the most beautiful\r\npossible. They are not preoccupied, as we are, with theories. They do\r\nnot excite themselves to express moral or philosophical ideas. They wish\r\nto enjoy through the imagination, through the eyes, like those Italian\r\nnobles, who, at the same time, were so captivated by fine colors and\r\nforms that they covered with paintings not only their rooms and their\r\nchurches, but the lids of their chests and the saddles of their horses.\r\nThe rich and green sunny country; young, gayly attired ladies, blooming\r\nwith health and love; half-draped gods and goddesses, masterpieces and\r\nmodels of strength and grace--these are the most lovely objects which\r\nman can contemplate, the most capable of satisfying his senses and his\r\nheart--of giving rise to smiles and joy; and these are the objects which\r\noccur in all the poets in a most wonderful abundance of songs,\r\npastorals, sonnets, little fugitive pieces, so lively, delicate, easily\r\nunfolded, that we have never since had their equals. What though Venus\r\nand Cupid have lost their altars? Like the contemporary painters of\r\nItaly, they willingly imagine a beautiful naked child, drawn on a\r\nchariot of gold through the limpid air; or a woman, redolent with youth,\r\nstanding on the waves, which kiss her snowy feet. Harsh Ben Jonson is\r\nravished with the scene. The disciplined battalion of his sturdy verses\r\nchanges into a band of little graceful strophes, which trip as lightly\r\nas Raphael's children. He sees his lady approach, sitting on the chariot\r\nof Love, drawn by swans and doves. Love leads the car; she passes calm\r\nand smiling, and all hearts, charmed by her divine looks, wish no other\r\njoy than to see and serve her forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"See the chariot at hand here of Love,\r\nWherein my lady rideth!\r\nEach that draws is a swan or a dove,\r\nAnd well the car Love guideth.\r\nAs she goes, all hearts do duty\r\nUnto her beauty;\r\nAnd, enamoured, do wish, so they might\r\nBut enjoy such a sight,\r\nThat they still were to run by her side,\r\nThrough swords, through seas, whither she would ride.\r\nDo but look on her eyes, they do light\r\nAll that Love's world compriseth!\r\nDo but look on her hair, it is bright\r\nAs Love's star when it riseth!...\r\nHave you seen but a bright lily grow,\r\nBefore rude hands have touched it?\r\nHave you marked but the fall o' the snow,\r\nBefore the soil hath smutched it?\r\nHave you felt the wool of beaver?\r\nOr swan's down ever?\r\nOr have smelt o' the bud o' the brier?\r\nOr the nard in the fire?\r\nOr have tasted the bag of the bee?\r\nO so white! O so soft! O so sweet is she!\"[336]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can be more lively, more unlike measured and artificial mythology?\r\nLike Theocritus and Moschus, they play with their smiling gods, and\r\ntheir belief becomes a festival. One day, in an alcove of a wood, Cupid\r\nmeets a nymph asleep:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her golden hair o'erspread her face,\r\nHer careless arms abroad were cast,\r\nHer quiver had her pillow's place,\r\nHer breast lay bare to every blast.\"[337]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe approaches softly, steals her arrows, and puts his own in their\r\nplace. She hears a noise at last, raises her reclining head, and sees a\r\nshepherd approaching. She flees; he pursues. She bends her bow, and\r\nshoots her arrows at him. He only becomes more ardent, and is on the\r\npoint of seizing her. In despair, she takes an arrow, and buries it in\r\nher lovely body. Lo! she is changed, she stops, smiles, loves, draws\r\nnear him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Though mountains meet not, lovers may.\r\nWhat other lovers do, did they.\r\nThe god of Love sat on a tree,\r\nAnd laught that pleasant sight to see.\"[338]\r\n\r\n\r\nA drop of archness falls into the medley of artlessness and voluptuous\r\ncharm; it was so in Longus, and in all that delicious nosegay called the\r\nAnthology. Not the dry mocking of Voltaire, of folks who possessed only\r\nwit, and always lived in a drawing-room; but the raillery of artists,\r\nlovers whose brain is full of color and form, who, when they recount a\r\nbit of roguishness, imagine a stooping neck, lowered eyes, the blushing\r\nof vermilion cheeks. One of these fair ones says the following verses,\r\nsimpering, and we can even see now the pouting of her lips:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Love in my bosom like a bee\r\nDoth suck his sweet.\r\nNow with his wings he plays with me,\r\nNow with his feet.\r\nWithin my eyes he makes his rest,\r\nHis bed amid my tender breast,\r\nMy kisses are his daily feast.\r\nAnd yet he robs me of my rest.\r\nAh! wanton, will ye!\"[339]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat relieves these sportive pieces is their splendor of imagination.\r\nThere are effects and flashes which we hardly dare quote, dazzling and\r\nmaddening, as in the _Song of Songs_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her eyes, fair eyes, like to the purest lights\r\nThat animate the sun, or cheer the day;\r\nIn whom the shining sunbeams brightly play,\r\nWhiles fancy doth on them divine delights.\r\n\r\n\"Her cheeks like ripened lilies steeped in wine,\r\nOr fair pomegranate kernels washed in milk,\r\nOr snow-white threads in nets of crimson silk,\r\nOr gorgeous clouds upon the sun's decline.\r\n\r\n\"Her lips are roses over-washed with dew,\r\nOr like the purple of Narcissus' flower...\r\n\r\n\"Her crystal chin like to the purest mould,\r\nEnchased with dainty daisies soft and white,\r\nWhere fancy's fair pavilion once is pight,\r\nWhereas embraced his beauties he doth hold.\r\n\r\n\"Her neck like to an ivory shining tower,\r\nWhere through with azure veins sweet nectar runs,\r\nOr like the down of swans where Senesse woons,\r\nOr like delight that doth itself devour.\r\n\r\n\"Her paps are like fair apples in the prime,\r\nAs round as orient pearls, as soft as down;\r\nThey never vail their fair through winter's frown,\r\nBut from their sweets love sucked his summer time.\"[340]\r\n\r\n\"What need compare, where sweet exceeds compare?\r\nWho draws his thoughts of love from senseless things,\r\nTheir pomp and greatest glories doth impair,\r\nAnd mounts love's heaven with overladen wings.\"[341]\r\n\r\n\r\nI can well believe that things had no more beauty then than now; but I\r\nam sure that men found them more beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhen the power of embellishment is so great, it is natural that they\r\nshould paint the sentiment which unites all joys, whither all dreams\r\nconverge--ideal love, and in particular, artless and happy love. Of all\r\nsentiments, there is none for which we have more sympathy. It is of all\r\nthe most simple and sweet. It is the first motion of the heart, and the\r\nfirst word of nature. It is made up of innocence and self-abandonment.\r\nIt is clear of reflection and effort. It extricates us from complicated\r\npassion, contempt, regret, hate, violent desires. It penetrates us, and\r\nwe breathe it as the fresh breath of the morning wind, which has swept\r\nover flowery meads. The knights of this perilous court inhaled it, and\r\nwere enraptured, and so rested in the contrast from their actions and\r\ntheir dangers. The most severe and tragic of their poets turned aside to\r\nmeet it, Shakespeare among the evergreen oaks of the forest of\r\nArden,[342] Ben Jonson in the woods of Sherwood,[343] amid the wide\r\nshady glades, the shining leaves and moist flowers, trembling on the\r\nmargin of lonely springs. Marlowe himself, the terrible painter of the\r\nagony of Edward II, the impressive and powerful poet, who wrote\r\n\"Faustus, Tamerlane\" and the \"Jew of Malta,\" leaves his sanguinary\r\ndramas, his high-sounding verse, his images of fury, and nothing can be\r\nmore musical and sweet than his song. A shepherd, to gain his lady-love,\r\nsays to her:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come live with me and be my Love,\r\nAnd we will all the pleasures prove\r\nThat hills and valleys, dale and field,\r\nAnd all the craggy mountains yield.\r\nThere we will sit upon the rocks,\r\nAnd see the shepherds feed their flocks,\r\nBy shallow rivers, to whose falls\r\nMelodious birds sing madrigals.\r\nThere will I make thee beds of roses\r\nAnd a thousand fragrant posies,\r\nA cap of flowers, and a kirtle\r\nEmbroider'd all with leaves of myrtle.\r\nA gown made of the finest wool,\r\nWhich from our pretty lambs we pull,\r\nFair lined slippers for the cold,\r\nWith buckles of the purest gold.\r\nA belt of straw and ivy buds,\r\nWith coral clasps and amber studs;\r\nAnd if these pleasures may thee move,\r\nCome live with me and be my Love....\r\nThe shepherd swains shall dance and sing\r\nFor thy delight each May-morning:\r\nIf these delights thy mind may move,\r\nThen live with me and be my Love.\"[344]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unpolished gentlemen of the period, returning from hawking, were\r\nmore than once arrested by such rustic pictures; such as they were, that\r\nis to say, imaginative and not very citizen-like, they had dreamed of\r\nfiguring in them on their own account. But while entering into, they\r\nreconstructed them; they reconstructed them in their parks, prepared for\r\nQueen Elizabeth's entrance, with a profusion of costumes and devices,\r\nnot troubling themselves to copy rough nature exactly. Improbability did\r\nnot disturb them; they were not minute imitators, students of manners:\r\nthey created; the country for them was but a setting, and the complete\r\npicture came from their fancies and their hearts. Romantic it may have\r\nbeen, even impossible, but it was on this account the more charming. Is\r\nthere a greater charm than putting on one side this actual world which\r\nfetters or oppresses us, to float vaguely and easily in the azure and\r\nthe light, on the summit of the cloud-capped land of fairies, to arrange\r\nthings according to the pleasure of the moment, no longer feeling the\r\noppressive laws, the harsh and resisting framework of life, adorning and\r\nvarying everything after the caprice and the refinements of fancy? That\r\nis what is done in these little poems. Usually the events are such as\r\nhappen nowhere, or happen in the land where kings turn shepherds and\r\nmarry shepherdesses. The beautiful Argentile[345] is detained at the\r\ncourt of her uncle, who wishes to deprive her of her kingdom, and\r\ncommands her to marry Curan, a boor in his service; she flees, and Curan\r\nin despair goes and lives two years among the shepherds. One day he\r\nmeets a beautiful country-woman, and loves her; gradually, while\r\nspeaking to her, he thinks of Argentile, and weeps; he describes her\r\nsweet face, her lithe figure, her blue-veined delicate wrists, and\r\nsuddenly sees that the peasant girl is weeping. She falls into his arms,\r\nand says, \"I am Argentile.\" Now Curan was a king's son, who had\r\ndisguised himself thus for love of Argentile. He resumes his armor, and\r\ndefeats the wicked king. There never was a braver knight; and they both\r\nreigned long in Northumberland. From a hundred such tales, tales of the\r\nspring-time, the reader will perhaps bear with me while I pick out one\r\nmore, gay and simple as a May morning. The Princess Dowsabel came down\r\none morning into her father's garden: she gathers honeysuckles,\r\nprimroses, violets, and daisies; then, behind a hedge, she heard a\r\nshepherd singing, and that so finely that she loved him at once. He\r\npromises to be faithful, and asks for a kiss. Her cheeks became as\r\ncrimson as a rose:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With that she bent her snow white knee,\r\nDown by the shepherd kneeled she,\r\nAnd him she sweetly kiss'd.\r\nWith that the shepherd whoop'd for joy;\r\nQuoth he: 'There's never shepherd's boy\r\nThat ever was so blest.'\"[346]\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing more; is it not enough? It is but a moment's fancy; but they had\r\nsuch fancies every moment. Think what poetry was likely to spring from\r\nthem, how superior to common events, how free from literal imitation,\r\nhow smitten with ideal beauty, how capable of creating a world beyond\r\nour sad world. In fact, among all these poems there is one truly divine,\r\nso divine that the reasoners of succeeding ages have found it wearisome,\r\nthat even now but few understand it--Spenser's \"Faërie Queene.\" One day\r\nM. Jourdain, having turned Mamamouchi[347] and learned orthography, sent\r\nfor the most illustrious writers of the age. He settled himself in his\r\narm-chair, pointed with his finger at several folding-stools for them to\r\nsit down, and said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have read your little productions, gentlemen. They have afforded me\r\nmuch pleasure. I wish to give you some work to do. I have given some\r\nlately to little Lulli,[348] your fellow-laborer. It was at my command\r\nthat he introduced the sea-shell at his concerts--a melodious\r\ninstrument, which no one thought of before, and which has such a\r\npleasing effect. I insist that you will work out my ideas as he has\r\nworked them out, and I give you an order for a poem in prose. What is\r\nnot prose, you know, is verse; and what is not verse is prose. When I\r\nsay, 'Nicolle, bring me my slippers and give me my nightcap,' I speak\r\nprose. Take this sentence as your model. This style is much more\r\npleasing than the jargon of unfinished lines which you call verse. As\r\nfor the subject, let it be myself. You will describe my flowered\r\ndressing-gown which I have put on to receive you in, and this little\r\ngreen velvet undress which I wear underneath, to do my morning exercise\r\nin. You will set down that this chintz costs a louis an ell. The\r\ndescription, if well worked out, will furnish some very pretty\r\nparagraphs, and will enlighten the public as to the cost of things. I\r\ndesire also that you should speak of my mirrors, my carpets, my\r\nhangings. My tradesmen will let you have their bills; don't fail to put\r\nthem in. I shall be glad to read in your works, all fully and naturally\r\nset forth, about my father's shop, who, like a real gentleman, sold\r\ncloth to oblige his friends; my maid Nicolle's kitchen, the genteel\r\nbehavior of Brusquet, the little dog of my neighbor M. Dimanche. You\r\nmight also explain my domestic affairs: there is nothing more\r\ninteresting to the public than to hear how a million may be scraped\r\ntogether. Tell them also that my daughter Lucile has not married that\r\nlittle rascal Cléonte, but M. Samuel Bernard, who made his fortune as a\r\n_fermier-général_, keeps his carriage and is going to be a minister of\r\nstate. For this I will pay you liberally, half a louis for a yard of\r\nwriting. Come back in a month, and let me see what my ideas have\r\nsuggested to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are the descendants of M. Jourdain, and this is how we have been\r\ntalking to the men of genius from the beginning of the century, and the\r\nmen of genius have listened to us. Hence arise our shoppy and realistic\r\nnovels. I pray the reader to forget them, to forget himself, to become\r\nfor a while a poet, a gentleman, a man of the sixteenth century. Unless\r\nwe bury the M. Jourdain who survives in us, we shall never understand\r\nSpenser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI--Edmund Spenser\r\n\r\n\r\nSpenser belonged to an ancient family, allied to great houses; was a\r\nfriend to Sidney and Raleigh, the two most accomplished knights of the\r\nage--a knight himself, at least in heart; who had found in his\r\nconnections, his friendships, his studies, his life, everything\r\ncalculated to lead him to ideal poetry. We find him at Cambridge, where\r\nhe imbues himself with the noblest ancient philosophies; in a northern\r\ncountry, where he passes through a deep and unfortunate passion; at\r\nPenshurst, in the castle and in the society where the \"Arcadia\" was\r\nproduced; with Sidney, in whom survived entire the romantic poetry and\r\nheroic generosity of the feudal spirit; at court, where all the\r\nsplendors of a disciplined and gorgeous chivalry were gathered about the\r\nthrone; finally, at Kilcolman, on the borders of a lake, in a lonely\r\ncastle, from which the view embraced an amphitheatre of mountains, and\r\nthe half of Ireland. Poor on the other hand,[349] not fit for court, and\r\nthough favored by the queen, unable to obtain from his patrons anything\r\nbut inferior employment; in the end, wearied of solicitations, and\r\nbanished to his dangerous property in Ireland, whence a rebellion\r\nexpelled him, after his house and child had been burned; he died three\r\nmonths later, of misery and a broken heart.[350] Expectations and\r\nrebuffs, many sorrows and many dreams, some few joys, and a sudden and\r\nfrightful calamity, a small fortune and a premature end; this indeed was\r\na poet's life. But the heart within was the true poet--from it all\r\nproceeded; circumstances furnished the subject only; he transformed them\r\nmore than they him; he received less than he gave. Philosophy and\r\nlandscapes, ceremonies and ornaments, splendors of the country and the\r\ncourt, on all which he painted or thought, he impressed his inward\r\nnobleness. Above all, his was a soul captivated by sublime and chaste\r\nbeauty, eminently platonic; one of these lofty and refined souls most\r\ncharming of all, who, born in the lap of nature, draw thence their\r\nsustenance, but soar higher, enter the regions of mysticism, and mount\r\ninstinctively in order to expand on the confines of a loftier world.\r\nSpenser leads us to Milton, and thence to Puritanism, as Plato to\r\nVergil, and thence to Christianity. Sensuous beauty is perfect in both,\r\nbut their main worship is for moral beauty. He appeals to the Muses:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Revele to me the sacred noursery\r\nOf vertue, which with you doth there remaine,\r\nWhere it in silver bowre does hidden ly\r\nFrom view of men and wicked worlds disdaine!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe encourages his knight when he sees him droop. He is wroth when he\r\nsees him attacked. He rejoices in his justice, temperance, courtesy. He\r\nintroduces in the beginning of a song, long stanzas in honor of\r\nfriendship and justice. He pauses, after relating a lovely instance of\r\nchastity, to exhort women to modesty. He pours out the wealth of his\r\nrespect and tenderness at the feet of his heroines. If any coarse man\r\ninsults them, he calls to their aid nature and the gods. Never does he\r\nbring them on his stage without adorning their name with splendid\r\neulogy. He has an adoration for beauty worthy of Dante and Plotinus. And\r\nthis, because he never considers it a mere harmony of color and form,\r\nbut an emanation of unique, heavenly, imperishable beauty, which no\r\nmortal eye can see, and which is the masterpiece of the great Author of\r\nthe worlds.[351] Bodies only render it visible; it does not live in\r\nthem; charm and attraction are not in things, but in the immortal idea\r\nwhich shines through them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For that same goodly hew of white and red,\r\nWith which the cheekes are sprinckled, shall decay,\r\nAnd those sweete rosy leaves, so fairly spred\r\nUpon the lips, shall fade and fall away\r\nTo that they were, even to corrupted clay:\r\nThat golden wyre, those sparckling stars so bright,\r\nShall turne to dust, and lose their goodly light.\r\nBut that faire lampe, from whose celestiall ray\r\nThat light proceedes, which kindleth lovers fire,\r\nShall never be extinguisht nor decay;\r\nBut, when the vitall spirits doe expyre,\r\nUpon her native planet shall retyre;\r\nFor it is heavenly borne, and cannot die,\r\nBeing a parcell of the purest skie.\"[352]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presence of this ideal of beauty, love is transformed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For Love is lord of Truth and Loialtie,\r\nLifting himself out of the lowly dust,\r\nOn golden plumes up to the purest skie,\r\nAbove the reach of loathly sinfull lust,\r\nWhose base affect through cowardly distrust\r\nOf his weake wings dare not to heaven fly,\r\nBut like a moldwarpe in the earth doth ly.\"[353]\r\n\r\n\r\nLove such as this contains all that is good, and fine, and noble. It is\r\nthe prime source of life, and the eternal soul of things. It is this\r\nlove which, pacifying the primitive discord, has created the harmony of\r\nthe spheres, and maintains this glorious universe. It dwells in God, and\r\nis God himself, come down in bodily form to regenerate the tottering\r\nworld and save the human race; around and within animated beings, when\r\nour eyes can pierce outward appearances, we behold it as a living light,\r\npenetrating and embracing every creature. We touch here the sublime\r\nsharp summit where the world of mind and the world of sense unite; where\r\nman, gathering with both hands the loveliest flowers of either, feels\r\nhimself at the same time a pagan and a Christian.\r\n\r\nSo much, as a testimony to his heart. But he was also a poet, that is,\r\npre-eminently a creator and a dreamer, and that most naturally,\r\ninstinctively, unceasingly. We might go on forever describing this\r\ninward condition of all great artists; there would still remain much to\r\nbe described. It is a sort of mental growth with them; at every instant\r\na bud shoots forth, and on this another and still another; each\r\nproducing, increasing, blooming of itself, so that after a few moments\r\nwe find first a green plant crop up, then a thicket, then a forest. A\r\ncharacter appears to them, then an action, then a landscape, then a\r\nsuccession of actions, characters, landscapes, producing, completing,\r\narranging themselves by instinctive development, as when in a dream we\r\nbehold a train of figures which, without any outward compulsion, display\r\nand group themselves before our eyes. This fount of living and changing\r\nforms is inexhaustible in Spenser; he is always imaging; it is his\r\nspecialty. He has but to close his eyes, and apparitions arise; they\r\nabound in him, crowd, overflow; in vain he pours them forth; they\r\ncontinually float up, more copious and more dense. Many times, following\r\nthe inexhaustible stream, I have thought of the vapors which rise\r\nincessantly from the sea, ascend, sparkle, commingle their golden and\r\nsnowy scrolls, while underneath them new mists arise, and others again\r\nbeneath, and the splendid procession never grows dim or ceases.\r\n\r\nBut what distinguishes him from all others is the mode of his\r\nimagination. Generally with a poet his mind ferments vehemently and by\r\nfits and starts; his ideas gather, jostle each other, suddenly appear in\r\nmasses and heaps, and burst forth in sharp, piercing, concentrative\r\nwords; it seems that they need these sudden accumulations to imitate the\r\nunity and life-like energy of the objects which they reproduce; at least\r\nalmost all the poets of that time, Shakespeare at their head, act thus.\r\nSpenser remains calm in the fervor of invention. The visions which would\r\nbe fever to another, leave him at peace. They come and unfold themselves\r\nbefore him, easily, entire, uninterrupted, without starts. He is epic,\r\nthat is, a narrator, not a singer like an ode-writer, nor a mimic like a\r\nplay-writer. No modern is more like Homer. Like Homer and the great\r\nepic-writers, he only presents consecutive and noble, almost classical\r\nimages, so nearly ideas, that the mind seizes them unaided and unawares.\r\nLike Homer, he is always simple and clear: he makes no leaps, he omits\r\nno argument, he robs no word of its primitive and ordinary meaning, he\r\npreserves the natural sequence of ideas. Like Homer, again, he is\r\nredundant, ingenuous, even childish. He says everything, he puts down\r\nreflections which we have made beforehand; he repeats without limit his\r\ngrand ornamental epithets. We can see that he beholds objects in a\r\nbeautiful uniform light, with infinite detail; that he wishes to show\r\nall this detail, never fearing to see his happy dream change or\r\ndisappear; that he traces its outline with a regular movement, never\r\nhurrying or slackening. He is even a little prolix, too unmindful of the\r\npublic, too ready to lose himself and dream about the things he beholds.\r\nHis thought expands in vast repeated comparisons, like those of the old\r\nIonic poet. If a wounded giant falls, he finds him\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As an aged tree,\r\nHigh growing on the top of rocky clift,\r\nWhose hart-strings with keene steele nigh hewen be,\r\nThe mightie trunck halfe rent with ragged rift,\r\nDoth roll adowne the rocks, and fall with fearefull drift.\r\n\r\n\"Or as a castle, reared high and round,\r\nBy subtile engins and malitious slight\r\nIs undermined from the lowest ground,\r\nAnd her foundation forst, and feebled quight,\r\nAt last downe falles; and with her heaped hight\r\nHer hastie ruine does more heavie make,\r\nAnd yields it selfe unto the victours might:\r\nSuch was this Gyaunt's fall, that seemd to shake\r\nThe stedfast globe of earth, as it for feare did quake.\"[354]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe develops all the ideas which he handles. All his phrases become\r\nperiods. Instead of compressing, he expands. To bear this ample thought\r\nand its accompanying train, he requires a long stanza, ever renewed,\r\nlong alternate verses, reiterated rhymes, whose uniformity and fullness\r\nrecall the majestic sounds which undulate eternally through the woods\r\nand the fields. To unfold these epic faculties, and to display them in\r\nthe sublime region where his soul is naturally borne, he requires an\r\nideal stage, situated beyond the bounds of reality, with personages who\r\ncould hardly exist, and in a world which could never be.\r\n\r\nHe made many miscellaneous attempts in sonnets, elegies, pastorals,\r\nhymns of love, little sparkling word-pictures;[355] they were but\r\nessays, incapable for the most part of supporting his genius. Yet\r\nalready his magnificent imagination appeared in them; gods, men,\r\nlandscapes, the world which he sets in motion is a thousand miles from\r\nthat in which we live. His \"Shepherd's Calendar\"[356] is a\r\nthought-inspiring and tender pastoral, full of delicate loves, noble\r\nsorrows, lofty ideas, where no voice is heard but of thinkers and poets.\r\nHis \"Visions of Petrarch and Du Bellay\" are admirable dreams, in which\r\npalaces, temples of gold, splendid landscapes, sparkling rivers,\r\nmarvellous birds, appear in close succession as in an Oriental\r\nfairy-tale. If he sings a \"Prothalamion,\" he sees two beautiful swans,\r\nwhite as snow, who come softly swimming down amidst the songs of nymphs\r\nand vermeil roses, while the transparent water kisses their silken\r\nfeathers, and murmurs with joy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,\r\nA flocke of Nymphes I chaunced to espy,\r\nAll lovely daughters of the Flood thereby,\r\nWith goodly greenish locks, all loose untyde,\r\nAs each had bene a bryde;\r\nAnd each one had a little wicker basket,\r\nMade of fine twigs, entrayled curiously,\r\nIn which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,\r\nAnd with fine fingers cropt full feateously\r\nThe tender stalkes on hye.\r\nOf every sort, which in that meadow grew,\r\nThey gathered some; the violet, pallid blew,\r\nThe little dazie, that at evening closes,\r\nThe virgin lillie, and the primrose trew,\r\nWith store of vermeil roses,\r\nTo deck their bridegroomes posies\r\nAgainst the brydale-day, which was not long:\r\nSweet Themmes! runne softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\n\"With that I saw two Swannes of goodly hewe\r\nCome softly swimming downe along the lee;\r\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see;\r\nThe snow, which doth the top of Pindus strew,\r\nDid never whiter shew...\r\nSo purely white they were,\r\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\r\nSeem'd foule to them, and bad his billowes spare\r\nTo wet their silken feathers, least they might\r\nSoyle their fayre plumes with water not so fayre,\r\nAnd marre their beauties bright,\r\nThat shone as heavens light,\r\nAgainst their brydale day, which was not long:\r\nSweet Themmes! runne softly, till I end my song!\"[357]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf he bewails the death of Sidney, Sidney becomes a shepherd, he is\r\nslain like Adonis; around him gather weeping nymphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The gods, which all things see, this same beheld,\r\nAnd, pittying this paire of lovers trew,\r\nTransformed them there lying on the field,\r\nInto one flowre that is both red and blew:\r\nIt first growes red, and then to blew doth fade,\r\nLike Astrophel, which thereinto was made.\r\n\r\n\"And in the midst thereof a star appeares,\r\nAs fairly formd as any star in skyes:\r\nResembling Stella in her freshest yeares,\r\nForth darting beames of beautie from her eyes;\r\nAnd all the day it standeth full of deow,\r\nWhich is the teares, that from her eyes did flow.\"[358]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis most genuine sentiments become thus fairy-like. Magic is the mould\r\nof his mind, and impresses its shape on all that he imagines or thinks.\r\nInvoluntarily he robs objects of their ordinary form. If he looks at a\r\nlandscape, after an instant he sees it quite differently. He carries it,\r\nunconsciously, into an enchanted land; the azure heaven sparkles like a\r\ncanopy of diamonds, meadows are clothed with flowers, a biped population\r\nflutters in the balmy air, palaces of jasper shine among the trees,\r\nradiant ladies appear on carved balconies above galleries of emerald.\r\nThis unconscious toil of mind is like the slow crystallizations of\r\nnature. A moist twig is cast into the bottom of a mine, and is brought\r\nout again a hoop of diamonds.\r\n\r\nAt last he finds a subject which suits him, the greatest joy permitted\r\nto an artist. He removes his epic from the common ground which, in the\r\nhands of Homer and Dante, gave expression to a living creed, and\r\ndepicted national heroes. He leads us to the summit of fairy-land,\r\nsoaring above history, on that extreme verge where objects vanish and\r\npure idealism begins: \"I have undertaken a work,\" he says, \"to represent\r\nall the moral virtues, assigning to every virtue a knight to be the\r\npatron and defender of the same; in whose actions and feats of armes and\r\nchivalry the operations of that vertue, whereof he is the protector, are\r\nto be expressed, and the vices and unruly appetites that oppose\r\nthemselves against the same, to be beaten downe and overcome.\"[359] In\r\nfact he gives us an allegory as the foundation of his poem, not that he\r\ndreams of becoming a wit, a preacher of moralities, a propounder of\r\nriddles. He does not subordinate image to idea; he is a seer, not a\r\nphilosopher. They are living men and actions which he sets in motion;\r\nonly from time to time, in his poem, enchanted palaces, a whole train of\r\nsplendid visions trembles and divides like a mist, enabling us to catch\r\na glimpse of the thought which raised and arranged it. When in his\r\nGarden of Adonis we see the countless forms of all living things\r\narranged in due order, in close compass, awaiting life, we conceive with\r\nhim the birth of universal love, the ceaseless fertility of the great\r\nmother, the mysterious swarm of creatures which rise in succession from\r\nher \"wide wombe of the world.\" When we see his Knight of the Cross\r\ncombating with a horrible woman-serpent in defence of his beloved lady\r\nUna, we dimly remember that, if we search beyond these two figures, we\r\nshall find behind one, Truth, behind the other, Falsehood. We perceive\r\nthat his characters are not flesh and blood, and that all these\r\nbrilliant phantoms are phantoms, and nothing more. We take pleasure in\r\ntheir brilliancy, without believing in their substantiality; we are\r\ninterested in their doings, without troubling ourselves about their\r\nmisfortunes. We know that their tears and cries are not real. Our\r\nemotion is purified and raised. We do not fall into gross illusion; we\r\nhave that gentle feeling of knowing ourselves to be dreaming. We, like\r\nhim, are a thousand leagues from actual life, beyond the pangs of\r\npainful pity, unmixed terror, violent and bitter hatred. We entertain\r\nonly refined sentiments, partly formed, arrested at the very moment they\r\nwere about to affect us with too sharp a stroke. They slightly touch us,\r\nand we find ourselves happy in being extricated from a belief which was\r\nbeginning to be oppressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--Spenser in his Relation to the Renaissance\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat world could furnish materials to so elevated a fancy? One only,\r\nthat of chivalry; for none is so far from the actual. Alone and\r\nindependent in his castle, freed from all the ties which society,\r\nfamily, toil, usually impose on the actions of men, the feudal hero had\r\nattempted every kind of adventure, but yet he had done less than he\r\nimagined; the boldness of his deeds had been exceeded by the madness of\r\nhis dreams. For want of useful employment and an accepted rule, his\r\nbrain had labored on an unreasoning and impossible track, and the\r\nurgency of his wearisomeness had increased beyond measure his craving\r\nfor excitement. Under this stimulus his poetry had become a world of\r\nimagery. Insensibly strange conceptions had grown and multiplied in his\r\nbrains, one over the other, like ivy woven round a tree, and the\r\noriginal trunk had disappeared beneath their rank growth and their\r\nobstruction. The delicate fancies of the old Welsh poetry, the grand\r\nruins of the German epics, the marvellous splendors of the conquered\r\nEast, all the recollections which four centuries of adventure had\r\nscattered among the minds of men, had become gathered into one great\r\ndream; and giants, dwarfs, monsters, the whole medley of imaginary\r\ncreatures, of superhuman exploits and splendid follies, were grouped\r\naround a unique conception, exalted and sublime love, like courtiers\r\nprostrated at the feet of their king. It was an ample and buoyant\r\nsubject-matter, from which the great artists of the age, Ariosto, Tasso,\r\nCervantes, Rabelais, had hewn their poems. But they belonged too\r\ncompletely to their own time, to admit of their belonging to one which\r\nhad passed.[360] They created a chivalry afresh, but it was not genuine.\r\nThe ingenious Ariosto, an ironical epicurean, delights his gaze with it,\r\nand grows merry over it, like a man of pleasure, a sceptic who rejoices\r\ndoubly in his pleasure because it is sweet, and because it is forbidden.\r\nBy his side poor Tasso, inspired by a fanatical, revived, factitious\r\nCatholicism, amid the tinsel of an old school of poetry, works on the\r\nsame subject, in sickly fashion, with great effort and scant success.\r\nCervantes, himself a knight, albeit he loves chivalry for its nobleness,\r\nperceives its folly, and crushes it to the ground, with heavy blows, in\r\nthe mishaps of the wayside inns. More coarsely, more openly, Rabelais, a\r\nrude commoner, drowns it with a burst of laughter, in his merriment and\r\nnastiness. Spenser alone takes it seriously and naturally. He is on the\r\nlevel of so much nobleness, dignity, reverie. He is not yet settled and\r\nshut in by that species of exact common-sense which was to found and\r\ncramp the whole modern civilization. In his heart he inhabits the poetic\r\nand shadowy land from which men were daily drawing farther and farther\r\naway. He is enamored of it, even to its very language; he revives the\r\nold words, the expressions of the Middle Ages, the style of Chaucer,\r\nespecially in the \"Shepherd's Calendar.\" He enters straightway upon the\r\nstrangest dreams of the old story-tellers, without astonishment, like a\r\nman who has still stranger dreams of his own. Enchanted castles,\r\nmonsters and giants, duels in the woods, wandering ladies, all spring up\r\nunder his hands, the mediæval fancy with the mediaeval generosity; and\r\nit is just because this world is unreal that it so suits his humor.\r\n\r\nIs there in chivalry sufficient to furnish him with matter? That is but\r\none world, and he has another. Beyond the valiant men, the glorified\r\nimages of moral virtues, he has the gods, finished models of sensible\r\nbeauty; beyond Christian chivalry he has the pagan Olympus; beyond the\r\nidea of heroic will which can only be satisfied by adventures and\r\ndanger, there exists calm energy, which, by its own impulse, is in\r\nharmony with actual existence. For such a poet one ideal is not enough;\r\nbeside the beauty of effort he places the beauty of happiness; he\r\ncouples them, not deliberately as a philosopher, nor with the design of\r\na scholar like Goethe, but because they are both lovely; and here and\r\nthere, amid armor and passages of arms, he distributes satyrs, nymphs,\r\nDiana, Venus, like Greek statues amid the turrets and lofty trees of an\r\nEnglish park. There is nothing forced in the union; the ideal epic, like\r\na superior heaven, receives and harmonizes the two worlds; a beautiful\r\npagan dream carries on a beautiful dream of chivalry; the link consists\r\nin the fact that they are both beautiful. At this elevation the poet has\r\nceased to observe the differences of races and civilizations. He can\r\nintroduce into his picture whatever he will; his only reason is, \"That\r\nsuited\"; and there could be no better. Under the glossy-leaved oaks, by\r\nthe old trunk so deeply rooted in the ground, he can see two knights\r\ncleaving each other, and the next instant a company of Fauns who came\r\nthere to dance. The beams of light which have poured down upon the\r\nvelvet moss, the green turf of an English forest, can reveal the\r\ndishevelled locks and white shoulders of nymphs. Do we not see it in\r\nRubens? And what signify discrepancies in the happy and sublime illusion\r\nof fancy? Are there more discrepancies? Who perceives them, who feels\r\nthem? Who does not feel, on the contrary, that to speak the truth, there\r\nis but one world, that of Plato and the poets; that actual phenomena are\r\nbut outlines--mutilated, incomplete and blurred outlines--wretched\r\nabortions scattered here and there on Time's track, like fragments of\r\nclay, half moulded, then cast aside, lying in an artist's studio; that,\r\nafter all, invisible forces and ideas, which forever renew the actual\r\nexistences, attain their fulfilment only in imaginary existences; and\r\nthat the poet, in order to express nature in its entirety, is obliged to\r\nembrace in his sympathy all the ideal forms by which nature reveals\r\nitself? This is the greatness of his work; he has succeeded in seizing\r\nbeauty in its fulness, because he cared for nothing but beauty.\r\n\r\nThe reader will feel that it is impossible to give in full the plot of\r\nsuch a poem. In fact, there are six poems, each of a dozen cantos, in\r\nwhich the action is ever diverging and converging again, becoming\r\nconfused and starting again; and all the imaginings of antiquity and of\r\nthe Middle Ages are, I believe, combined in it. The knight \"pricks along\r\nthe plaine,\" among the trees, and at a crossing of the paths meets other\r\nknights with whom he engages in combat; suddenly from within a cave\r\nappears a monster, half woman and half serpent, surrounded by a hideous\r\noffspring; further on a giant, with three bodies; then a dragon, great\r\nas a hill, with sharp talons and vast wings. For three days he fights\r\nthem, and twice overthrown, he comes to himself only by aid of \"a\r\ngracious ointment.\" After that there are savage tribes to be conquered,\r\ncastles surrounded by flames to be taken. Meanwhile ladies are wandering\r\nin the midst of forests, on white palfreys, exposed to the assaults of\r\nmiscreants, now guarded by a lion which follows them, now delivered by a\r\nband of satyrs who adore them. Magicians work manifold charms; palaces\r\ndisplay their festivities; tilt-yards provide endless tournaments;\r\nsea-gods, nymphs, fairies, kings, intermingle in these feasts,\r\nsurprises, dangers.\r\n\r\nYou will say it is a phantasmagoria. What matter, if we see it? And we\r\ndo see it, for Spenser does. His sincerity communicates itself to us. He\r\nis so much at home in this world that we end by finding ourselves at\r\nhome in it too. He shows no appearance of astonishment at astonishing\r\nevents; he comes upon them so naturally that he makes them natural; he\r\ndefeats the miscreants, as if he had done nothing else all his life.\r\nVenus, Diana, and the old deities, dwell at his gate and enter his\r\nthreshold without his taking any heed of them. His serenity becomes\r\nours. We grow credulous and happy by contagion, and to the same extent\r\nas he. How could it be otherwise? Is it possible to refuse credence to a\r\nman who paints things for us with such accurate details and in such\r\nlively colors? Here with a dash of his pen he describes a forest for\r\nyou; and are you not instantly in it with him Beech trees with their\r\nsilvery stems, \"loftie trees iclad with sommers pride, did spred so\r\nbroad, that heavens light did hide\"; rays of light tremble on the bark\r\nand shine on the ground, on the reddening ferns and low bushes, which,\r\nsuddenly smitten with the luminous track, glisten and glimmer. Footsteps\r\nare scarcely heard on the thick beds of heaped leaves; and at distant\r\nintervals, on the tall herbage, drops of dew are sparkling. Yet the\r\nsound of a horn reaches us through the foliage; how sweetly yet\r\ncheerfully it falls on the ear, amidst this vast silence! It resounds\r\nmore loudly; the clatter of a hunt draws near; \"eft through the thicke\r\nthey heard one rudely rush;\" a nymph approaches, the most chaste and\r\nbeautiful in the world. Spenser sees her; nay more, he kneels before\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her face so faire, as flesh it seemed not,\r\nBut hevenly pourtraict of bright angels hew,\r\nCleare as the skye, withouten blame or blot,\r\nThrough goodly mixture of complexions dew;\r\nAnd in her cheekes the vermeill red did shew\r\nLike roses in a bed of lillies shed,\r\nThe which ambrosiall odours from them threw,\r\nAnd gazers sence with double pleasure fed,\r\nHable to heale the sicke and to revive the ded.\r\n\r\n\"In her faire eyes two living lamps did flame,\r\nKindled above at th' Hevenly Makers light,\r\nAnd darted fyrie beames out of the same;\r\nSo passing persant, and so wondrous bright,\r\nThat quite bereav'd the rash beholders sight:\r\nIn them the blinded god his lustfull fyre\r\nTo kindle oft assayd, but had no might;\r\nFor, with dredd maiestie and awfull yre,\r\nShe broke his wanton darts, and quenched bace desyre.\r\n\r\n\"Her yvorie forhead, full of bountie brave,\r\nLike a broad table did itselfe dispred,\r\nFor Love his loftie triumphes to engrave,\r\nAnd write the battailes of his great godhed:\r\nAll good and honour might therein be red;\r\nFor there their dwelling was. And, when she spake\r\nSweete wordes, like dropping honny, she did shed;\r\nAnd 'twixt the perles and rubins softly brake\r\nA silver sound, that heavenly musicke seemd to make.\r\n\r\n\"Upon her eyelids many Graces sate,\r\nUnder the shadow of her even browes,\r\nWorking belgardes and amorous retrate;\r\nAnd everie one her with a grace endowes,\r\nAnd everie one with meekenesse to her bowes:\r\nSo glorious mirrhour of celestiall grace,\r\nAnd soveraine moniment of mortall vowes,\r\nHow shall frayle pen descrive her heavenly face,\r\nFor feare, through want of skill, her beauty to disgrace.\r\n\r\n\"So faire, and thousand thousand times more faire,\r\nShe seemd, when she presented was to sight;\r\nAnd was yclad, for heat of scorching aire,\r\nAll in a silken Camus lilly whight,\r\nPurfled upon with many a folded plight,\r\nWhich all above besprinckled was throughout\r\nWith golden aygulets, that glistred bright,\r\nLike twinckling starres; and all the skirt about\r\nWas hemd with golden fringe.\r\n\r\n\"Below her ham her weed did somewhat trayne,\r\nAnd her streight legs most bravely were embayld\r\nIn gilden buskins of costly cordwayne,\r\nAll bard with golden bendes, which were entayld\r\nWith curious antickes, and full fayre aumayld.\r\nBefore, they fastned were under her knee\r\nIn a rich iewell, and therein entrayld\r\nThe ends of all the knots, that none might see\r\nHow they within their fouldings close enwrapped bee.\r\n\r\n\"Like two faire marble pillours they were seene,\r\nWhich doe the temple of the gods support,\r\nWhom all the people decke with girlands greene,\r\nAnd honour in their festivall resort;\r\nThose same with stately grace and princely port\r\nShe taught to tread, when she herselfe would grace;\r\nBut with the woody nymphes when she did play,\r\nOr when the flying libbard she did chace,\r\nShe could them nimbly move, and after fly apace.\r\n\r\n\"And in her hand a sharpe bore-speare she held,\r\nAnd at her backe a bow and quiver gay,\r\nStuft with steel-headed dartes wherewith she queld\r\nThe salvage beastes in her victorious play,\r\nKnit with a golden bauldricke which forelay\r\nAthwart her snowy brest, and did divide\r\nHer daintie paps; which, like young fruit in May,\r\nNow little gan to swell, and being tide\r\nThrough her thin weed their places only signifide.\r\n\r\n\"Her yellow lockes, crisped like golden wyre,\r\nAbout her shoulders weren loosely shed,\r\nAnd, when the winde emongst them did inspyre,\r\nThey waved like a penon wyde dispred\r\nAnd low behinde her backe were scattered:\r\nAnd, whether art it were or heedlesse hap,\r\nAs through the flouring forrest rash she fled,\r\nIn her rude heares sweet flowres themselves did lap,\r\nAnd flourishing fresh leaves and blossomes did enwrap.\"[361]\r\n\r\n\"The daintie rose, the daughter of her morne,\r\nMore deare than life she tendered, whose flowre\r\nThe girlond of her honour did adorne;\r\nNe suffered she the middayes scorching powre.\r\nNe the sharp northerne wind thereon to showre;\r\nBut lapped up her silken leaves most chayre,\r\nWhenso the froward skye began to lowre;\r\nBut, soone as calmed was the cristall ayre,\r\nShe did it fayre dispred, and let to flourish fayre.\"[362]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is on his knees before her, I repeat, as a child on Corpus Christi\r\nday, among flowers and perfumes, transported with admiration, so that he\r\nsees a heavenly light in her eyes, and angel's tints on her cheeks, even\r\nimpressing into her service Christian angels and pagan graces to adorn\r\nand await upon her; it is love which brings such visions before him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sweet love, that doth his golden wings embay\r\nIn blessed nectar and pure pleasures well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence this perfect beauty, this modest and charming dawn, in which he\r\nassembles all the brightness, all the sweetness, all the virgin graces\r\nof the full morning? What mother begat her, what marvellous birth\r\nbrought to light such a wonder of grace and purity? One day, in a\r\nsparkling, solitary fountain, where the sunbeams shone, Chrysogone was\r\nbathing with roses and violets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was upon a sommers shinie day,\r\nWhen Titan faire his beamës did display,\r\nIn a fresh fountaine, far from all mens vew,\r\nShe bath'd her brest the boyling heat t' allay;\r\nShe bath'd with roses red and violets blew,\r\nAnd all the sweetest flowers that in the forrest grew.\r\nTill faint through yrkesome wearines adowne\r\nUpon the grassy ground herselfe she layd\r\nTo sleepe, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne\r\nUpon her fell all naked bare displayd.\"[363]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beams played upon her body, and \"fructified\" her. The months rolled\r\non. Troubled and ashamed, she went into the \"wildernesse,\" and sat down,\r\n\"every sence with sorrow sore opprest.\" Meanwhile Venus, searching for\r\nher boy Cupid, who had mutinied and fled from her, \"wandered in the\r\nworld.\" She had sought him in courts, cities, cottages, promising\r\n\"kisses sweet, and sweeter things, unto the man that of him tydings to\r\nher brings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Shortly unto the wastefull woods she came,\r\nWhereas she found the goddesse (Diana) with her crew,\r\nAfter late chace of their embrewed game,\r\nSitting beside a fountaine in a rew;\r\nSome of them washing with the liquid dew\r\nFrom off their dainty limbs the dusty sweat\r\nAnd soyle, which did deforme their lively hew;\r\nOthers lay shaded from the scorching heat,\r\nThe rest upon her person gave attendance great.\r\nShe, having hong upon a bough on high\r\nHer bow and painted quiver, had unlaste\r\nHer silver buskins from her nimble thigh,\r\nAnd her lanck loynes ungirt, and brests unbraste,\r\nAfter her heat the breathing cold to taste;\r\nHer golden lockes, that late in tresses bright\r\nEmbreaded were for hindring of her haste,\r\nNow loose about her shoulders hong undight,\r\nAnd were with sweet Ambrosia all besprinckled light.\"[364]\r\n\r\n\r\nDiana, surprised thus, repulses Venus, \"and gan to smile, in scorne of\r\nher vaine playnt,\" swearing that if she should catch Cupid, she would\r\nclip his wanton wings. Then she took pity on the afflicted goddess, and\r\nset herself with her to look for the fugitive. They came to the \"shady\r\ncovert\" where Chrysogone, in her sleep, had given birth \"unawares\" to\r\ntwo lovely girls, \"as faire as springing day.\" Diana took one, and made\r\nher the purest of all virgins. Venus carried off the other to the Garden\r\nof Adonis, \"the first seminary of all things, that are borne to live and\r\ndye\"; where Psyche, the bride of Love, disports herself; where Pleasure,\r\ntheir daughter, wantons with the Graces; where Adonis, \"lapped in\r\nflowres and pretious spycery, liveth in eternal bliss,\" and came back\r\nto life through the breath of immortal Love. She brought her up as her\r\ndaughter, selected her to be the most faithful of loves, and after long\r\ntrials, gave her hand to the good knight Sir Scudamore.\r\n\r\nThat is the kind of thing we meet with in the wondrous forest. Are you\r\nill at ease there, and do you wish to leave it because it is wondrous?\r\nAt every bend in the alley, at every change of the light, a stanza, a\r\nword, reveals a landscape or an apparition. It is morning, the white\r\ndawn gleams faintly through the trees; bluish vapors veil the horizon,\r\nand vanish in the smiling air; the springs tremble and murmur faintly\r\namongst the mosses, and on high the poplar leaves begin to stir and\r\nflutter like the wings of butterflies. A knight alights from his horse,\r\na valiant knight, who has unhorsed many a Saracen, and experienced many\r\nan adventure. He unlaces his helmet, and on a sudden you perceive the\r\ncheeks of a young girl:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Which doft, her golden lockes, that were upbound\r\nStill in a knot, unto her heeles downe traced,\r\nAnd like a silken veile in compasse round\r\nAbout her backe and all her bodie wound;\r\nLike as the shining skie in summers night,\r\nWhat time the dayes with scorching heat abound,\r\nIs creasted all with lines of firie light,\r\nThat it prodigious seemes in common peoples sight.\"[365]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is Britomart, a virgin and a heroine, like Clorinda or Marfisa,[366]\r\nbut how much more ideal! The deep sentiment of nature, the sincerity of\r\nreverie, the ever-flowing fertility of inspiration, the German\r\nseriousness, reanimate in this poem classical or chivalrous conceptions,\r\neven when they are the oldest or the most trite. The train of splendors\r\nand of scenery never ends. Desolate promontories, cleft with gaping\r\nchasms; thunder-stricken and blackened masses of rocks, against which\r\nthe hoarse breakers dash; palaces sparkling with gold, wherein ladies,\r\nbeauteous as angels, reclining carelessly on purple cushions, listen\r\nwith sweet smiles to the harmony of music played by unseen hands; lofty\r\nsilent walks, where avenues of oaks spread their motionless shadows over\r\nclusters of virgin violets, and turf which never mortal foot has trod;\r\nto all these beauties of art and nature he adds the marvels of\r\nmythology, and describes them with as much of love and sincerity as a\r\npainter of the Renaissance or an ancient poet. Here approach on chariots\r\nof shell, Cymoënt and her nymphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A teme of dolphins raunged in aray\r\nDrew the smooth charett of sad Cymoënt;\r\nThey were all taught by Triton to obay\r\nTo the long raynes at her commaundëment:\r\nAs swifte as swallowes on the waves they went,\r\nThat their brode flaggy finnes no fome did reare,\r\nNe bubling rowndell they behinde them sent;\r\nThe rest, of other fishes drawen weare;\r\nWhich with their finny oars the swelling sea did sheare.\"[367]\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing, again, can be sweeter or calmer than the description of the\r\npalace of Morpheus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He, making speedy way through spersed ayre,\r\nAnd through the world of waters wide and deepe.\r\nTo Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.\r\nAmid the bowels of the earth full steepe,\r\nAnd low, where dawning day doth never peepe\r\nHis dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed\r\nDoth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe\r\nIn silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,\r\nWhiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.\r\nAnd, more to lulle him in his slumber soft,\r\nA trickling streame from high rock tumbling downe\r\nAnd ever-drizzling raine upon the loft,\r\nMixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\r\nOf swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne.\r\nNo other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,\r\nAs still are wont t' annoy the walled towne,\r\nMight there be heard: but careless Quiet lyes,\r\nWrapt in eternall silence farre from enimyes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve also in a corner of this forest, a band of satyrs dancing under\r\nthe green leaves. They come leaping like wanton kids, as gay as birds of\r\njoyous spring. The fair Hellenore, whom they have chosen for \"May-lady,\"\r\n\"daunst lively\" also, laughing, and \"with girlonds all bespredd.\" The\r\nwood re-echoes the sound of their \"merry pypes. Their horned feet the\r\ngreene gras wore. All day they daunced with great lustyhedd,\" with\r\nsudden motions and alluring looks, while about them their flock feed on\r\n\"the brouzes\" at their pleasure. In every book we see strange\r\nprocessions pass by, allegorical and picturesque shows, like those which\r\nwere then displayed at the courts of princes; now a masquerade of Cupid,\r\nnow of the Rivers, now of the Months, now of the Vices. Imagination was\r\nnever more prodigal or inventive. Proud Lucifera advances in a chariot\r\n\"adorned all with gold and girlonds gay,\" beaming like the dawn,\r\nsurrounded by a crowd of courtiers whom she dazzles with her glory and\r\nsplendor: \"six unequall beasts\" draw her along, and each of these is\r\nridden by a Vice. Idleness \"upon a slouthfull asse... in habit blacke...\r\nlike to an holy monck,\" sick for very laziness, lets his heavy head\r\ndroop, and holds in his hand a breviary which he does not read;\r\nGluttony, on \"a filthie swyne,\" crawls by in his deformity, \"his\r\nbelly... upblowne with luxury, and eke with fatnesse swollen were his\r\neyne; and like a crane his necke was long and fyne,\" dressed in\r\nvine-leaves, through which one can see his body eaten by ulcers, and\r\nvomiting along the road the wine and flesh with which he is glutted.\r\nAvarice seated between \"two iron coffers, upon a camell loaden all\r\nwith gold,\" is handling a heap of coin, with threadbare coat, hollow\r\ncheeks, and feet stiff with gout. Envy \"upon a ravenous wolfe still did\r\nchaw between his cankred teeth a venemous tode, that all the poison ran\r\nabout his chaw,\" and his discolored garment \"ypainted full of eies,\"\r\nconceals a snake wound about his body. Wrath, covered with a torn and\r\nbloody robe, comes riding on a lion, brandishing about his head \"a\r\nburning brond,\" his eyes sparkling, his face pale as ashes, grasping in\r\nhis feverish hand the haft of his dagger. The strange and terrible\r\nprocession passes on, led by the solemn harmony of the stanzas; and the\r\ngrand music of oft-repeated rhymes sustains the imagination in this\r\nfantastic world, which, with its mingled horrors and splendors, has just\r\nbeen opened to its flight.\r\n\r\nYet all this is little. However much mythology and chivalry can supply,\r\nthey do not suffice for the needs of this poetical fancy. Spenser's\r\ncharacteristic is the vastness and overflow of his picturesque\r\ninvention. Like Rubens, whatever he creates is beyond the region of all\r\ntraditions, but complete in all parts, and expresses distinct ideas. As\r\nwith Rubens, his allegory swells its proportions beyond all rule, and\r\nwithdraws fancy from all law, except in so far as it is necessary to\r\nharmonize forms and colors. For, if ordinary minds receive from allegory\r\na certain weight which oppresses them, lofty imaginations receive from\r\nit wings which carry them aloft. Freed by it from the common conditions\r\nof life, they can dare all things, beyond imitation, apart from\r\nprobability, with no other guides but their inborn energy and their\r\nshadowy instincts. For three days Sir Guyon is led by the cursed spirit,\r\nthe tempter Mammon, in the subterranean realm, across wonderful gardens,\r\ntrees laden with golden fruits, glittering palaces, and a confusion of\r\nall worldly treasures. They have descended into the bowels of the earth,\r\nand pass through caverns, unknown abysses, silent depths. \"An ugly\r\nFeend... with monstrous stalke behind him stept,\" without Guyon's\r\nknowledge, ready to devour him on the least show of covetousness. The\r\nbrilliancy of the gold lights up hideous figures, and the beaming metal\r\nshines with a beauty more seductive in the gloom of the infernal prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That Houses forme within was rude and strong,\r\nLyke an huge cave hewne out of rocky clifte,\r\nFrom whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong\r\nEmbost with massy gold of glorious guifte,\r\nAnd with rich metall loaded every rifte,\r\nThat heavy ruine they did seeme to threatt;\r\nAnd over them Arachne high did lifte\r\nHer cunning web, and spred her subtile nett,\r\nEnwrapped in fowle smoke and clouds more black than iett.\r\n\r\n\"Both roofe, and floore, and walls, were all of gold,\r\nBut overgrowne with dust and old decay,\r\nAnd hid in darknes, that none could behold\r\nThe hew thereof; for vew of cheerfull day\r\nDid never in that House itselfe display,\r\nBut a faint shadow of uncertein light;\r\nSuch as a lamp; whose life does fade away;\r\nOr as the moone, cloathed with dowdy night,\r\nDoes show to him that walkes in feare and sad affright.\r\n\r\n\"In all that rowme was nothing to be seene\r\nBut huge great yron chests and coffers strong,\r\nAll bard with double bends, that none could weene\r\nThem to enforce by violence or wrong;\r\nOn every side they placed were along.\r\nBut all the grownd with sculs was scattered\r\nAnd dead mens bones, which round about were flong;\r\nWhose lives, it seemed, whilome there were shed,\r\nAnd their vile carcases now left unburied....\r\n\r\n\"Thence, forward he him ledd and shortly brought\r\nUnto another rowme, whose dore forthright\r\nTo him did open as it had beene taught:\r\nTherein an hundred raunges weren pight,\r\nAnd hundred fournaces all burning bright;\r\nBy every fournace many Feends did byde,\r\nDeformed creatures, horrible in sight;\r\nAnd every Feend his busie paines applyde\r\nTo melt the golden metall, ready to be tryde.\r\n\r\n\"One with great bellowes gathered filling ayre,\r\nAnd with forst wind the fewell did inflame;\r\nAnother did the dying bronds repayre\r\nWith yron tongs, and sprinckled ofte the same\r\nWith liquid waves, fiers Vulcans rage to tame,\r\nWho, maystring them, renewd his former heat:\r\nSome scumd the drosse that from the metall came;\r\nSome stird the molten owre with ladles great:\r\nAnd every one did swincke, and every one did sweat...\r\n\r\n\"He brought him, through a darksom narrow strayt,\r\nTo a broad gate all built of beaten gold:\r\nThe gate was open; but therein did wayt\r\nA sturdie Villein, stryding stiffe and bold,\r\nAs if the Highest God defy he would:\r\nIn his right hand an yron club he held,\r\nBut he himselfe was all of golden mould,\r\nYet had both life and sence, and well could weld\r\nThat cursed weapon, when his cruell foes he queld....\r\n\r\n\"He brought him in. The rowme was large and wyde,\r\nAs it some gyeld or solemne temple weare;\r\nMany great golden pillours did upbeare\r\nThe massy roofe, and riches huge sustayne;\r\nAnd every pillour decked was full deare\r\nWith crownes, and diademes, and titles vaine,\r\nWhich mortall princes wore whiles they on earth did rayne.\r\n\r\n\"A route of people there assembled were,\r\nOf every sort and nation under skye,\r\nWhich with great uprore preaced to draw nere\r\nTo th' upper part, where was advaunced hye\r\nA stately siege of soveraine maiestye;\r\nAnd thereon satt a Woman gorgeous gay,\r\nAnd richly cladd in robes of royaltye,\r\nThat never earthly prince in such aray\r\nHis glory did enhaunce, and pompous pryde display....\r\n\r\n\"There, as in glistring glory she did sitt,\r\nShe held a great gold chaine ylincked well,\r\nWhose upper end to highest heven was knitt.\r\nAnd lower part did reach to lowest hell.\"[368]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo artist's dream matches these visions: the glow of the furnaces\r\nbeneath the vaults of the cavern, the lights flickering over the crowded\r\nfigures, the throne, and the strange glitter of the gold shining in\r\nevery direction through the darkness. The allegory assumes gigantic\r\nproportions. When the object is to show temperance struggling with\r\ntemptations, Spenser deems it necessary to mass all the temptations\r\ntogether. He is treating of a general virtue; and as such a virtue is\r\ncapable of every sort of resistance, he requires from it every sort of\r\nresistance alike; after the test of gold, that of pleasure. Thus the\r\ngrandest and the most exquisite spectacles follow and are contrasted\r\nwith each other, and all are supernatural; the graceful and the terrible\r\nare side by side--the happy gardens close by with the cursed\r\nsubterranean cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No gate, but like one, being goodly dight\r\nWith bowes and braunches, which did broad dilate\r\nTheir clasping armes in wanton wreathings intricate:\r\n\r\n\"So fashioned a porch with rare device,\r\nArcht over head with an embracing vine,\r\nWhose bounches hanging downe seemed to entice\r\nAll passers-by to taste their lushious wine,\r\nAnd did themselves into their hands incline,\r\nAs freely offering to be gathered;\r\nSome deepe empurpled as the hyacine,\r\nSome as the rubine laughing sweetely red,\r\nSome like faire emeraudes, not yet well ripened....\r\n\r\n\"And in the midst of all a fountaine stood,\r\nOf richest substance that on earth might bee,\r\nSo pure and shiny that the silver flood\r\nThrough every channell running one might see;\r\nMost goodly it with curious ymageree\r\nWas over-wrought, and shapes of naked boyes,\r\nOf which some seemed with lively iollitee\r\nTo fly about, playing their wanton toyes,\r\nWhylest others did themselves embay in liquid ioyes.\r\n\r\n\"And over all of purest gold was spred\r\nA trayle of yvie in his native hew;\r\nFor the rich metall was so coloured,\r\nThat wight, who did not well avis'd it vew,\r\nWould surely deeme it to bee yvie trew;\r\nLow his lascivious armes adown did creepe,\r\nThat themselves dipping in the silver dew\r\nTheir fleecy flowres they fearfully did steepe,\r\nWhich drops of christall seemd for wantones to weep.\r\n\r\n\"Infinit streames continually did well\r\nOut of this fountaine, sweet and faire to see,\r\nThe which into an ample laver fell,\r\nAnd shortly grew to such great quantitie,\r\nThat like a little lake it seemd to bee;\r\nWhose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,\r\nThat through the waves one might the bottom see,\r\nAll pav'd beneath with jaspar shining bright,\r\nThat seemd the fountaine in that sea did sayle upright....\r\n\r\n\"The ioyes birdes, shrouded in chearefull shade,\r\nTheir notes unto the voice attempred sweet;\r\nTh' angelicall soft trembling voyces made\r\nTo th' instruments divine respondence meet;\r\nThe silver-sounding instruments did meet\r\nWith the base murmur of the waters fall;\r\nThe waters fall with difference discreet.\r\nNow soft, now loud, unto the wind did call;\r\nThe gentle warbling wind low answered to all....\r\n\r\n\"Upon a bed of roses she was layd,\r\nAs faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin;\r\nAnd was arayd, or rather disarayd,\r\nAll in a vele of silke and silver thin,\r\nThat hid no whit her alabaster skin,\r\nBut rather shewd more white, if more might bee:\r\nMore subtile web Arachne cannot spin;\r\nNor the fine nets, which oft we woven see\r\nOf scorched deaw, do not in th' ayre more lightly flee.\r\n\r\n\"Her snowy brest was bare to ready spoyle\r\nOf hungry eies, which n' ote therewith be fild;\r\nAnd yet, through languour of her late sweet toyle,\r\nFew drops, more cleare then nectar, forth distild,\r\nThat like pure orient perles adowne it trild;\r\nAnd her faire eyes, sweet smyling in delight,\r\nMoystened their fierie beames, with which she thrild\r\nFraile harts, yet quenched not, like starry lights\r\nWhich sparckling on the silent waves, does seeme more bright.\"[369]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo we find here nothing but fairy land? Yes; here are finished pictures\r\ntrue and complete, composed with a painter's feeling, with choice of\r\ntints and outlines; our eyes are delighted by them. This reclining\r\nAcrasia has the pose of a goddess, or of one of Titian's courtesans. An\r\nItalian artist might copy these gardens, these flowing waters, these\r\nsculptured loves, those wreaths of creeping ivy thick with glossy leaves\r\nand fleecy flowers. Just before, in the infernal depths, the lights,\r\nwith their long streaming rays, were fine, half smothered by the\r\ndarkness; the lofty throne in the vast hall, between the pillars, in the\r\nmidst of a swarming multitude, connected all the forms around it by\r\ndrawing all looks towards one centre. The poet, here and throughout, is\r\na colorist and an architect. However fantastic his world may be, it is\r\nnot factitious; if it does not exist, it might have been; indeed, it\r\nshould have been; it is the fault of circumstances if they do not so\r\ngroup themselves as to bring it to pass; taken by itself, it possesses\r\nthat internal harmony by which a real thing, even a still higher\r\nharmony, exists, inasmuch as, without any regard to real things, it is\r\naltogether, and in its least detail, constructed with a view to beauty.\r\nArt has made its appearance; this is the great characteristic of the\r\nage, which distinguishes the \"Faërie Queene\" from all similar tales\r\nheaped up by the Middle Ages. Incoherent, mutilated, they lie like\r\nrubbish, or rough-hewn stones, which the weak hands of the _trouvères_\r\ncould not build into a monument. At last the poets and artists appear,\r\nand with them the conception of beauty, to wit, the idea of general\r\neffect. They understand proportions, relations, contrasts; they compose.\r\nIn their hands the blurred vague sketch becomes defined, complete,\r\nseparate; it assumes color--is made a picture. Every object thus\r\nconceived and imaged acquires a definite existence as soon as it assumes\r\na true form; centuries after, it will be acknowledged and admired, and\r\nmen will be touched by it; and more, they will be touched by its author;\r\nfor, besides the object which he paints, the poet paints himself. His\r\nruling idea is stamped upon the work which it produces and controls.\r\nSpenser is superior to his subject, comprehends it fully, frames it with\r\na view to its end, in order to impress upon it the proper mark of his\r\nsoul and his genius. Each story is modulated with respect to another,\r\nand all with respect to a certain effect which is being worked out. Thus\r\na beauty issues from this harmony--the beauty in the poet's heart--which\r\nhis whole work strives to express; a noble and yet a cheerful beauty,\r\nmade up of moral elevation and sensuous seductions, English in\r\nsentiment, Italian in externals, chivalric in subject, modern in its\r\nperfection, representing a unique and wonderful epoch, the appearance of\r\npaganism in a Christian race, and the worship of form by an imagination\r\nof the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART III.--Prose_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--The Decay of Poetry\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch an epoch can scarcely last, and the poetic vitality wears itself\r\nout by its very efflorescence, so that its expansion leads to its\r\ndecline. From the beginning of the seventeenth century the subsidence of\r\nmanners and genius grows apparent. Enthusiasm and respect decline. The\r\nminions and court-fops intrigue and pilfer, amid pedantry, puerility,\r\nand show. The court plunders, and the nation murmurs. The Commons begin\r\nto show a stern front, and the king, scolding them like a schoolmaster,\r\ngives way before them like a little boy. This sorry monarch (James I)\r\nsuffers himself to be bullied by his favorites, writes to them like a\r\ngossip, calls himself a Solomon, airs his literary vanity, and in\r\ngranting an audience to a courtier, recommends him to become a scholar,\r\nand expects to be complimented on his own scholarly attainments. The\r\ndignity of the government is weakened, and the people's loyalty is\r\ncooled. Royalty declines, and revolution is fostered. At the same time,\r\nthe noble chivalric paganism degenerates into a base and coarse\r\nsensuality. The king, we are told, on one occasion, had got so drunk\r\nwith his royal brother Christian of Denmark, that they both had to be\r\ncarried to bed. Sir John Harrington says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The ladies abandon their sobriety, and are seen to roll about in\r\nintoxication.... The Lady who did play the Queen's part (in the Masque\r\nof the Queen of Sheba) did carry most precious gifts to both their\r\nMajesties; but, forgetting the steppes arising to the canopy, overset\r\nher caskets into his Danish Majesties lap, and fell at his feet, tho I\r\nrather think it was in his face. Much was the hurry and confusion;\r\ncloths and napkins were at hand, to make all clean. His Majestie then\r\ngot up and would dance with the Queen of Sheba; but he fell down and\r\nhumbled himself before her, and was carried to an inner chamber and laid\r\non a bed of state; which was not a little defiled with the presents of\r\nthe Queen which had been bestowed on his garments; such as wine, cream,\r\njelly, beverage, cakes, spices, and other good matters. The\r\nentertainment and show went forward, and most of the presenters went\r\nbackward, or fell down; wine did so occupy their upper chambers. Now did\r\nappear, in rich dress, Hope, Faith, and Charity: Hope did assay to\r\nspeak, but wine rendered her endeavours so feeble that she withdrew, and\r\nhoped the king would excuse her brevity: Faith... left the court in a\r\nstaggering condition.... They were both sick and spewing in the lower\r\nhall. Next came Victory, who... by a strange medley of versification...\r\nand after much lamentable utterance was led away like a silly captive,\r\nand laid to sleep in the outer steps of the anti-chamber. As for Peace,\r\nshe most rudely made war with her olive branch, and laid on the pates of\r\nthose who did oppose her coming. I ne'er did see such lack of good\r\norder, discretion, and sobriety in our Queen's days.\"[370]\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve that these tipsy women were great ladies. The reason is, that\r\nthe grand ideas which introduce an epoch, end, in their exhaustion, by\r\npreserving nothing but their vices; the proud sentiment of natural life\r\nbecomes a vulgar appeal to the senses. An entrance, an arch of triumph\r\nunder James I, often represented obscenities; and later, when the\r\nsensual instincts, exasperated by Puritan tyranny, begin to raise their\r\nheads once more, we shall find under the Restoration excess revelling in\r\nits low vices, and triumphing in its shamelessness.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile literature undergoes a change; the powerful breeze which had\r\nwafted it on, and which, amidst singularity, refinement, exaggerations,\r\nhad made it great, slackened and diminished. With Carew, Suckling, and\r\nHerrick, prettiness takes the place of the beautiful. That which strikes\r\nthem is no longer the general features of things; and they no longer try\r\nto express the inner character of what they describe. They no longer\r\npossess that liberal conception, that instinctive penetration, by which\r\nwe sympathize with objects, and grow capable of creating them anew. They\r\nno longer boast of that overflow of emotions, that excess of ideas and\r\nimages, which compelled a man to relieve himself by words, to act\r\nexternally, to represent freely and boldly the interior drama which made\r\nhis whole body and heart tremble. They are rather wits of the court,\r\ncavaliers of fashion, who wish to show off their imagination and style.\r\nIn their hands love becomes gallantry; they write songs, fugitive\r\npieces, compliments to the ladies. There are no more upwellings from the\r\nheart. They write eloquent phrases in order to be applauded, and\r\nflattering exaggerations in order to please. The divine faces, the\r\nserious or profound looks, the virgin or impassioned expressions which\r\nburst forth at every step in the early poets, have disappeared; here we\r\nsee nothing but agreeable countenances, painted in agreeable verses.\r\nBlackguardism is not far off; we meet with it already in Suckling, and\r\ncrudity to boot, and prosaic epicurism; their sentiment is expressed\r\nbefore long, in such a phrase as: \"Let us amuse ourselves, and a fig for\r\nthe rest.\" The only objects they can still paint are little graceful\r\nthings, a kiss, a May-day festivity, a dewy primrose, a daffodil, a\r\nmarriage morning, a bee.[371] Herrick and Suckling especially produce\r\nlittle exquisite poems, delicate, ever pleasant or agreeable, like those\r\nattributed to Anacreon, or those which abound in the Anthology. In fact,\r\nhere, as at the Grecian period alluded to, we are in the decline of\r\npaganism; energy departs, the reign of the agreeable begins. People do\r\nnot relinquish the worship of beauty and pleasure, but dally with them.\r\nThey deck and fit them to their taste; they cease to subdue and bend\r\nmen, who enjoy them whilst they amuse them. It is the last beam of a\r\nsetting sun; the genuine poetic sentiment dies out with Sedley, Waller,\r\nand the rhymesters of the Restoration; they write prose in verse; their\r\nheart is on a level with their style, and with an exact language we find\r\nthe commencement of a new age and a new art.\r\n\r\nSide by side with prettiness comes affectation; it is the second mark of\r\ntheir decadence. Instead of writing to express things, they write to say\r\nthem well; they outbid their neighbors, and strain every mode of speech;\r\nthey push art over on the one side to which it had a leaning; and as in\r\nthis age it had a leaning towards vehemence and imagination, they pile\r\nup their emphasis and coloring. A jargon always springs out of a style.\r\nIn all arts, the first masters, the inventors, discover the idea, steep\r\nthemselves in it, and leave it to effect its outward form. Then come the\r\nsecond class, the imitators, who sedulously repeat this form, and alter\r\nit by exaggeration. Some nevertheless have talent, as Quarles, Herbert,\r\nHabington, Donne in particular, a pungent satirist, of terrible\r\ncrudeness,[372] a powerful poet, of a precise and intense imagination,\r\nwho still preserves something of the energy and thrill of the original\r\ninspiration.[373] But he deliberately spoils all these gifts, and\r\nsucceeds with great difficulty in concocting a piece of nonsense. For\r\ninstance, the impassioned poets had said to their mistress that if they\r\nlost her, they should hate all other women. Donne, in order to eclipse\r\nthem, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O do not die, for I shall hate\r\nAll women so, when thou art gone,\r\nThat thee I shall not celebrate\r\nWhen I remember thou wast one.\"[374]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty times while reading him we rub our brow, and ask with\r\nastonishment, how a man could have so tormented and contorted himself,\r\nstrained his style, refined on his refinement, hit upon such absurd\r\ncomparisons? But this was the spirit of the age; they made an effort to\r\nbe ingeniously absurd. A flea had bitten Donne and his mistress, and he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This flea is you and I, and this\r\nOur mariage bed and mariage temple is.\r\nThough Parents grudge, and you, w' are met,\r\nAnd cloyster'd in these living walls of Jet.\r\nThough use make you apt to kill me,\r\nLet not to that selfe-murder added be,\r\nAnd sacrilege, three sins in killing three.\"[375]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Mascarille[376] never found anything to equal this. Would\r\nyou have believed a writer could invent such absurdities? She and he\r\nmade but one, for both are but one with the flea, and so one could not\r\nbe killed without the other. Observe that the wise Malherbe wrote very\r\nsimilar enormities, in the \"Tears of St. Peter,\" and that the sonneteers\r\nof Italy and Spain reach simultaneously the same height of folly, and\r\nyou will agree that throughout Europe at that time they were at the\r\nclose of a poetical epoch.\r\n\r\nOn this boundary line of a closing and a dawning literature a poet\r\nappeared, one of the most approved and illustrious of his time, Abraham\r\nCowley,[377] a precocious child, a reader and a versifier like Pope, and\r\nwho, like Pope, having known passions less than books, busied himself\r\nless about things than about words. Literary exhaustion has seldom been\r\nmore manifest. He possesses all the capacity to say what pleases him,\r\nbut he has precisely nothing to say. The substance has vanished, leaving\r\nin its place an empty form. In vain he tries the epic, the Pindaric\r\nstrophe, all kinds of stanzas, odes, short lines, long lines; in vain he\r\ncalls to his assistance botanical and philosophical similes, all the\r\nerudition of the university, all the recollections of antiquity, all the\r\nideas of new science: we yawn as we read him. Except in a few\r\ndescriptive verses, two or three graceful tendernesses,[378] he feels\r\nnothing, he speaks only; he is a poet of the brain. His collection of\r\namorous pieces is but a vehicle for a scientific test, and serves to\r\nshow that he has read the authors, that he knows geography, that he is\r\nwell versed in anatomy, that he has a smattering of medicine and\r\nastronomy, that he has at his service comparisons and allusions enough\r\nto rack the brains of his readers. He will speak in this wise:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Beauty, thou active--passive ill!\r\nWhich dy'st thyself as fast as thou dost kill!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOr will remark that his mistress is to blame for spending three hours\r\nevery morning at her toilet, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They make that Beauty Tyranny,\r\nThat's else a Civil-government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading two hundred pages, you feel disposed to box his ears. You\r\nhave to think, by way of consolation, that every grand age must draw to\r\na close, that this one could not do so otherwise, that the old glow of\r\nenthusiasm, the sudden flood of rapture, images, whimsical and audacious\r\nfancies, which once rolled through the minds of men, arrested now and\r\ncooled down, could only exhibit dross, a curdling scum, a multitude of\r\nbrilliant and offensive points. You say to yourself that, after all,\r\nCowley had perhaps talent; you find that he had in fact one, a new\r\ntalent, unknown to the old masters, the sign of a new culture, which\r\nneeds other manners, and announces a new society. Cowley had these\r\nmanners, and belongs to this society. He was a well-governed,\r\nreasonable, well-informed, polished, well-educated man, who, after\r\ntwelve years of service and writing in France, under Queen Henrietta,\r\nretires at last wisely into the country, where he studies natural\r\nhistory, and prepares a treatise on religion, philosophizing on men and\r\nlife, fertile in general reflections and ideas, a moralist, bidding his\r\nexecutor \"to let nothing stand in his writings which might seem the\r\nleast in the world to be an offence against religion or good manners.\"\r\nSuch intentions and such a life produce and indicate less a poet, that\r\nis, a seer, a creator, than a literary man; I mean a man who can think\r\nand speak, and who therefore ought to have read much, learned much,\r\nwritten much, ought to possess a calm and clear mind, to be accustomed\r\nto polite society, sustained conversation, pleasantry. In fact, Cowley\r\nis an author by profession, the oldest of those who in England deserve\r\nthe name. His prose is as easy and sensible as his poetry is contorted\r\nand unreasonable. A polished man, writing for polished men, pretty much\r\nas he would speak to them in a drawing-room--this I take to be the idea\r\nwhich they had of a good author in the seventeenth century. It is the\r\nidea which Cowley's essays leave of his character; it is the kind of\r\ntalent which the writers of the coming age take for their model, and he\r\nis the first of that grave and amiable group which, continued in Temple,\r\nreaches so far as to include Addison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--The Intellectual Level of the Renaissance\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving reached this point, the Renaissance seemed to have attained its\r\nlimit, and, like a drooping and faded flower, to be ready to leave its\r\nplace for a new bud which began to spring up amongst its withered\r\nleaves. At all events, a living and unexpected shoot sprang from the old\r\ndeclining stock. At the moment when art languished, science shot forth;\r\nthe whole labor of the age ended in this. The fruits are not unlike; on\r\nthe contrary, they come from the same sap, and by the diversity of the\r\nshape only manifest two distinct periods of the inner growth which has\r\nproduced them. Every art ends in a science, and all poetry in a\r\nphilosophy. For science and philosophy do but translate into precise\r\nformulas the original conceptions which art and poetry render sensible\r\nby imaginary figures: when once the idea of an epoch is manifested in\r\nverse by ideal creations, it naturally comes to be expressed in prose by\r\npositive arguments. That which had struck men on escaping from\r\necclesiastical oppression and monkish asceticism was the pagan idea of a\r\nlife true to nature, and freely developed. They had found nature buried\r\nbehind scholasticism, and they had expressed it in poems and paintings;\r\nin Italy by superb healthy corporeality, in England by vehement and\r\nunconventional spirituality, with such divination of its laws,\r\ninstincts, and forms, that we might extract from their theatre and their\r\npictures a complete theory of soul and body. When enthusiasm is past,\r\ncuriosity begins. The sentiment of beauty gives way to the need of\r\ntruth. The theory contained in works of imagination frees itself. The\r\ngaze continues fixed on nature, not to admire now, but to understand.\r\nFrom painting we pass to anatomy, from the drama to moral philosophy,\r\nfrom grand poetical divinations to great scientific views; the second\r\ncontinue the first, and the same mind displays itself in both; for what\r\nart had represented, and science proceeds to observe, are living things,\r\nwith their complex and complete structure, set in motion by their\r\ninternal forces, with no supernatural intervention. Artists and savants\r\nall set out, without knowing it themselves, from the same master\r\nconception, to wit, that nature subsists of herself, that every\r\nexistence has in its own womb the source of its action, that the causes\r\nof events are the innate laws of things; an all-powerful idea, from\r\nwhich was to issue the modern civilization, and which, at the time I\r\nwrite of, produced in England and Italy, as before in Greece, genuine\r\nsciences, side by side with a complete art: after da Vinci and Michel\r\nAngelo, the school of anatomists, mathematicians, naturalists, ending\r\nwith Galileo; after Spenser, Ben Jonson, and Shakespeare, the school of\r\nthinkers who surround Bacon and lead up to Harvey.\r\n\r\nWe have not far to look for this school. In the interregnum of\r\nChristianity the dominating bent of mind belongs to it. It was paganism\r\nwhich reigned in Elizabeth's court, not only in letters, but in\r\ndoctrine--a paganism of the North, always serious, generally sombre, but\r\nwhich was based, like that of the South, on natural forces. In some men\r\nall Christianity had passed away; many proceeded to atheism through\r\nexcess of rebellion and debauchery, like Marlowe and Greene. With\r\nothers, like Shakespeare, the idea of God scarcely makes its\r\nappearance; they see in our poor short human life only a dream, and\r\nbeyond it the long sad sleep: for them, death is the goal of life; at\r\nmost, a dark gulf, into which man plunges, uncertain of the issue. If\r\nthey carry their gaze beyond, they perceive,[379] not the spiritual soul\r\nwelcomed into a purer world, but the corpse abandoned to the damp earth,\r\nor the ghost hovering about the churchyard. They speak like sceptics or\r\nsuperstitious men, never as true believers. Their heroes have human, not\r\nreligious, virtues; against crime they rely on honor and the love of the\r\nbeautiful, not on piety and the fear of God. If others, at intervals,\r\nlike Sidney and Spenser, catch a glimpse of the Divine, it is as a vague\r\nideal light, a sublime Platonic phantom, which has no resemblance to a\r\npersonal God, a strict inquisitor of the slightest motions of the heart.\r\nHe appears at the summit of things, like the splendid crown of the\r\nworld, but He does not weigh upon human life; He leaves it intact and\r\nfree, only turning it towards the beautiful. Man does not know as yet\r\nthe sort of narrow prison in which official cant and respectable creeds\r\nwere, later on, to confine activity and intelligence. Even the\r\nbelievers, sincere Christians like Bacon and Sir Thomas Browne, discard\r\nall oppressive sternness, reduce Christianity to a sort of moral poetry,\r\nand allow naturalism to subsist beneath religion. In such a broad and\r\nopen channel, speculation could spread its wings. With Lord Herbert\r\nappeared a systematic deism; with Milton and Algernon Sidney, a\r\nphilosophical religion; Clarendon went so far as to compare Lord\r\nFalkland's gardens to the groves of Academe. Against the rigorism of the\r\nPuritans, Chillingworth, Hales, Hooker, the greatest doctors of the\r\nEnglish Church, give a large place to natural reason--so large, that\r\nnever, even to this day, has it made such an advance.\r\n\r\nAn astonishing irruption of facts--the discovery of America, the revival\r\nof antiquity, the restoration of philology, the invention of the arts,\r\nthe development of industries, the march of human curiosity over the\r\nwhole of the past and the whole of the globe--came to furnish\r\nsubject-matter, and prose began its reign. Sidney, Wilson, Ascham, and\r\nPuttenham explored the rules of style; Hakluyt and Purchas compiled the\r\ncyclopædia of travel and the description of every land; Holinshed,\r\nSpeed, Raleigh, Stowe, Knolles, Daniel, Thomas May, Lord Herbert,\r\nfounded history; Camden, Spelman, Cotton, Usher, and Selden inaugurate\r\nscholarship; a legion of patient workers, of obscure collectors, of\r\nliterary pioneers, amassed, arranged, and sifted the documents which Sir\r\nRobert Cotton and Sir Thomas Bodley stored up in their libraries; whilst\r\nUtopians, moralists, painters of manners--Thomas More, Joseph Hall, John\r\nEarle, Owen Feltham, Burton--described and passed judgment on the modes\r\nof life, continued with Fuller, Sir Thomas Browne, and Izaak Walton up\r\nto the middle of the next century, and add to the number of\r\ncontroversialists and politicians who, with Hooker, Taylor,\r\nChillingworth, Algernon Sidney, Harrington, study religion, society,\r\nchurch, and state. A copious and confused fermentation, from which\r\nabundance of thoughts rose, but few notable books. Noble prose, such as\r\nwas heard at the court of Louis XIV, in the house of Pollio, in the\r\nschools at Athens, such as rhetorical and sociable nations know how to\r\nproduce, was altogether lacking. These men had not the spirit of\r\nanalysis, the art of following step by step the natural order of ideas,\r\nnor the spirit of conversation, the talent never to weary or shock\r\nothers. Their imagination is too little regulated, and their manners too\r\nlittle polished. They who had mixed most in the world, even Sidney,\r\nspeak roughly what they think, and as they think it. Instead of glossing\r\nthey exaggerate. They blurt out all, and withhold nothing. When they do\r\nnot employ excessive compliments, they take to coarse jokes. They are\r\nignorant of measured liveliness, refined raillery, delicate flattery.\r\nThey rejoice in gross puns, dirty allusions. They mistake involved\r\ncharades and grotesque images for wit. Though they are great lords and\r\nladies, they talk like ill-bred persons, lovers of buffoonery, of shows,\r\nand bear-fights. With some, as Overbury or Sir Thomas Browne, prose is\r\nso much run over by poetry, that it covers its narrative with images,\r\nand hides ideas under its pictures. They load their style with flowery\r\ncomparisons, which produce one another, and mount one above another, so\r\nthat sense disappears, and ornament only is visible. In short, they are\r\ngenerally pedants, still stiff with the rust of the school; they divide\r\nand subdivide, propound theses, definitions; they argue solidly and\r\nheavily, and quote their authors in Latin, and even in Greek; they\r\nsquare their massive periods, and learnedly knock their adversaries\r\ndown, and their readers too, as a natural consequence. They are never on\r\nthe prose-level, but always above or below--above by their poetic\r\ngenius, below by the weight of their education and the barbarism of\r\ntheir manners. But they think seriously and for themselves; they are\r\ndeliberate; they are convinced and touched by what they say. Even in the\r\ncompiler we find a force and loyalty of spirit, which give confidence\r\nand cause pleasure. Their writings are like the powerful and heavy\r\nengravings of their contemporaries, the maps of Hofnagel for instance,\r\nso harsh and so instructive; their conception is sharp and clear; they\r\nhave the gift of perceiving every object, not under a general aspect,\r\nlike the classical writers, but specially and individually. It is not\r\nman in the abstract, the citizen as he is everywhere, the countryman as\r\nsuch, that they represent, but James or Thomas, Smith or Brown, of such\r\na parish, from such an office, with such and such attitude or dress,\r\ndistinct from all others; in short, they see, not the idea, but the\r\nindividual. Imagine the disturbance that such a disposition produces in\r\na man's head, how the regular order of ideas becomes deranged by it; how\r\nevery object, with the infinite medley of its forms, properties,\r\nappendages, will thenceforth fasten itself by a hundred points of\r\ncontact unforeseen to other objects, and bring before the mind a series\r\nand a family; what boldness language will derive from it; what familiar,\r\npicturesque, absurd words, will break forth in succession; how the dash,\r\nthe unforeseen, the originality and inequality of invention, will stand\r\nout. Imagine, at the same time, what a hold this form of mind has on\r\nobjects, how many facts it condenses in each conception; what a mass of\r\npersonal judgments, foreign authorities, suppositions, guesses,\r\nimaginations, it spreads over every subject; with what venturesome and\r\ncreative fecundity it engenders both truth and conjecture. It is an\r\nextraordinary chaos of thoughts and forms, often abortive, still more\r\noften barbarous, sometimes grand. But from this superfluity something\r\nlasting and great is produced; namely, science, and we have only to\r\nexamine more closely into one or two of these works to see the new\r\ncreation emerge from the blocks and the debris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Robert Burton\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo writers especially display this state of mind. The first, Robert\r\nBurton, a clergyman and university recluse, who passed his life in\r\nlibraries, and dabbled in all the sciences, as learned as Rabelais,\r\nhaving an inexhaustible and overflowing memory; unequal, moreover,\r\ngifted with enthusiasm, and spasmodically gay, but as a rule sad and\r\nmorose, to the extent of confessing in his epitaph that melancholy made\r\nup his life and his death; in the first place original, liking his own\r\ncommon-sense, and one of the earliest models of that singular English\r\nmood which, withdrawing man within himself, develops in him, at one time\r\nimagination, at another scrupulosity, at another oddity, and makes of\r\nhim, according to circumstances, a poet, an eccentric, a humorist, a\r\nmadman, or a puritan. He read on for thirty years, put an encyclopædia\r\ninto his head, and now, to amuse and relieve himself, takes a folio of\r\nblank paper. Twenty lines of a poet, a dozen lines of a treatise on\r\nagriculture, a folio page of heraldry, a description of rare fishes, a\r\nparagraph of a sermon on patience, the record of the fever fits of\r\nhypochondria, the history of the particle that, a scrap of\r\nmetaphysics--that is what passes through his brain in a quarter of an\r\nhour; it is a carnival of ideas and phrases, Greek, Latin, German,\r\nFrench, Italian, philosophical, geometrical, medical, poetical,\r\nastrological, musical, pedagogic, heaped one on the other; an enormous\r\nmedley, a prodigious mass of jumbled quotations, jostling thoughts, with\r\nthe vivacity and the transport of a feast of unreason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This roving humour (though not with like success) I have ever had, and,\r\nlike a ranging spaniel that barks at every bird he sees, leaving his\r\ngame, I have followed all, saving that which I should, and may justly\r\ncomplain, and truly, _qui ubique est, nusquam est_, which Gesner did in\r\nmodesty, that I have read many books, but to little purpose, for want of\r\ngood method, I have confusedly tumbled over divers authors in our\r\nlibraries with small profit, for want of art, order, memory, judgment. I\r\nnever travelled but in map or card, in which my unconfined thoughts have\r\nfreely expatiated, as having ever been especially delighted with the\r\nstudy of cosmography. Saturn was lord of my geniture, culminating, etc.,\r\nand Mars principal significator of manners, in partile conjunction with\r\nmine ascendent; both fortunate in their houses, etc. I am not poor, I am\r\nnot rich; _nihil est, nihil deest_; I have little; I want nothing: all\r\nmy treasure is in Minerva's tower. Greater preferment as I could never\r\nget, so am I not in debt for it. I have a competency (_laus Deo_) from\r\nmy noble and munificent patrons. Though I live still a collegiat\r\nstudent, as Democritus in his garden, and lead a monastique life, _ipse\r\nmihi theatrum_, sequestred from those tumults and troubles of the world,\r\n_et tanquam in speculâ positus_ (as he said), in some high place above\r\nyou all, like _Stoïcus sapiens, omnia sœcula prœterita prœsentiaque\r\nvidens, uno velut intuitu_, I hear and see what is done abroad, how\r\nothers run, ride, turmoil, and macerate themselves in court and\r\ncountrey. Far from these wrangling lawsuits, _aulœ vanitatem, fori\r\nambitionem, ridere mecum soleo_: I laugh at all, only secure, lest my\r\nsuit go amiss, my ships perish, corn and cattle miscarry, trade decay; I\r\nhave no wife nor children, good or bad, to provide for; a mere spectator\r\nof other men's fortunes and adventures, and how they act their parts,\r\nwhich methinks are diversely presented unto me, as from a common theatre\r\nor scene. I hear new news every day: and those ordinary rumours of war,\r\nplagues, fires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors,\r\ncomets, spectrums, prodigies, apparitions; of towns taken, cities\r\nbesieged in France, Germany, Turkey, Persia, Poland, etc., daily musters\r\nand preparations, and such like, which these tempestuous times afford,\r\nbattles fought, so many men slain, monomachies, shipwracks, piracies,\r\nand sea-fights, peace, leagues, stratagems, and fresh alarms--a vast\r\nconfusion of vows, wishes, actions, edicts, petitions, lawsuits, pleas,\r\nlaws, proclamations, complaints, grievances--are daily brought to our\r\nears: new books every day, pamphlets, currantoes, stories, whole\r\ncatalogues of volumes of all sorts, new paradoxes, opinions, schisms,\r\nheresies, controversies in philosophy, religion, etc. Now come tidings\r\nof weddings, maskings, mummeries, entertainments, jubilies, embassies,\r\ntilts and tournaments, trophies, triumphs, revels, sports, playes: then\r\nagain, as in a new shifted scene, treasons, cheating tricks, robberies,\r\nenormous villanies in all kinds, funerals, burials, death of princes,\r\nnew discoveries, expeditions; now comical, then tragical matters. To-day\r\nwe hear of new lords and officers created, to-morrow of some great men\r\ndeposed, and then again of fresh honours conferred: one is let loose,\r\nanother imprisoned: one purchaseth, another breaketh: he thrives, his\r\nneighbour turns bankrupt; now plenty, then again dearth and famine; one\r\nruns, another rides, wrangles, laughs, weeps, etc. Thus I daily hear,\r\nand such like, both private and publick news.\"[380]\r\n\r\n\"For what a world of books offers itself, in all subjects, arts, and\r\nsciences, to the sweet content and capacity of the reader? In\r\narithmetick, geometry, perspective, optick, astronomy, architecture,\r\n_sculptura, pictura_, of which so many and such elaborate treatises are\r\nof late written: in mechanicks and their mysteries, military matters,\r\nnavigation, riding of horses, fencing, swimming, gardening, planting,\r\ngreat tomes of husbandry, cookery, faulconry, hunting, fishing, fowling,\r\netc., with exquisite pictures of all sports, games, and what not. In\r\nmusick, metaphysicks, natural and moral philosophy, philologie, in\r\npolicy, heraldry, genealogy, chronology, etc., they afford great tomes,\r\nor those studies of antiquity, etc., _et quid subtilius arithmeticis\r\ninventionibus? quia jucundius musicis rationibus? quid divinius\r\nastronomicis? quid rectius geometricis demonstrationibus?_ What so sure,\r\nwhat so pleasant? He that shall but see the geometrical tower of\r\nGarezenda at Bologne in Italy, the steeple and clock at Strasborough,\r\nwill admire the effects of art, or that engine of Archimedes to remove\r\nthe earth itself, if he had but a place to fasten his instrument.\r\n_Archimedis cochlea_, and rare devises to corrivate waters, musick\r\ninstruments, and trisyllable echoes again, again, and again repeated,\r\nwith miriades of such. What vast tomes are extant in law, physick, and\r\ndivinity, for profit, pleasure, practice, speculation, in verse or\r\nprose, etc.! Their names alone are the subject of whole volumes; we have\r\nthousands of authors of all sorts, many great libraries, full well\r\nfurnished, like so many dishes of meat, served out for several palates,\r\nand he is a very block that is affected with none of them. Some take an\r\ninfinite delight to study the very languages wherein these books are\r\nwritten--Hebrew, Greek, Syriack, Chalde, Arabick, etc. Methinks it would\r\nwell please any man to look upon a geographical map (_suavi animum\r\ndelectatione allicere, ob incredibilem rerum varietatem et jucunditatem,\r\net ad pleniorem sui cognitionem excitare_), chorographical,\r\ntopographical delineations; to behold, as it were, all the remote\r\nprovinces, towns, cities of the world, and never to go forth of the\r\nlimits of his study; to measure, by the scale and compasse, their\r\nextent, distance, examine their site. Charles the Great (as Platina\r\nwrites) had three faire silver tables, in one of which superficies was a\r\nlarge map of Constantinople, in the second Rome neatly engraved, in the\r\nthird an exquisite description of the whole world; and much delight he\r\ntook in them. What greater pleasure can there now be, than to view those\r\nelaborate maps of Ortelius, Mercator, Hondius, etc.? to peruse those\r\nbooks of cities put out by Braunus and Hogenbergius? to read those\r\nexquisite descriptions of Maginus, Munster, Herrera, Laet, Merula,\r\nBoterus, Leander Albertus, Camden, Leo Afer, Adricomius, Nic. Gerbelius,\r\netc.? those famous expeditions of Christopher Columbus, Americus\r\nVespucius, Marcus Polus the Venetian, Lod. Vertomannus, Aloysius\r\nCadamustus, etc.? those accurate diaries of Portugals, Hollanders, of\r\nBartison, Oliver a Nort, etc., Hacluit's Voyages, Pet. Martyr's Decades,\r\nBenzo, Lerius, Linschoten's relations, those Hodaeporicons of Jod. a\r\nMeggen, Brocarde the Monke, Bredenbachius, Jo. Dublinius, Sands, etc.,\r\nto Jerusalem, Egypt, and other remote places of the world? those\r\npleasant itineraries of Paulus Hentzerus, Jodocus Sincerus, Dux Polonus,\r\netc.? to read Bellonius observations, P. Gillius his survayes; those\r\nparts of America, set out, and curiously cut in pictures, by Fratres a\r\nBry? To see a well cut herbal, hearbs, trees, flowers, plants, all\r\nvegetals, expressed in their proper colours to the life, as that of\r\nMatthiolus upon Dioscorides, Delacampius, Lobel, Bauhinus, and that last\r\nvoluminous and mighty herbal of Besler of Noremberge; wherein almost\r\nevery plant is to his own bignesse. To see birds, beasts, and fishes of\r\nthe sea, spiders, gnats, serpents, flies, etc., all creatures set out by\r\nthe same art, and truly expressed in lively colours, with an exact\r\ndescription of their natures, vertues, qualities, etc., as hath been\r\naccurately performed by Ælian, Gesner, Ulysses Aldrovandus, Bellonius,\r\nRondoletius, Hippolytus Salvianus, etc.\"[381]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is never-ending; words, phrases, overflow, are heaped up, overlap\r\neach other, and flow on, carrying the reader along, deafened, stunned,\r\nhalf drowned, unable to touch ground in the deluge. Burton is\r\ninexhaustible. There are no ideas which he does not iterate under fifty\r\nforms: when he has exhausted his own, he pours out upon us other\r\nmen's--the classics, the rarest authors, known only by savants—authors\r\nrarer still, known only to the learned; he borrows from all. Underneath\r\nthese deep caverns of erudition and science, there is one blacker and\r\nmore unknown than all the others, filled with forgotten authors, with\r\ncrackjaw names, Besler of Nuremberg, Adricomius, Linschoten, Brocarde,\r\nBredenbachius. Amidst all these antediluvian monsters, bristling with\r\nLatin terminations, he is at his ease; he sports with them, laughs,\r\nskips from one to the other, drives them all abreast. He is like old\r\nProteus, the sturdy rover, who in one hour, with his team of\r\nhippopotami, makes the circuit of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhat subject does he take? Melancholy, his own individual mood; and he\r\ntakes it like a schoolman. None of St. Thomas Aquinas's treatises is\r\nmore regularly constructed than his. This torrent of erudition flows in\r\ngeometrically planned channels, turning off at right angles without\r\ndeviating by a line. At the head of every part you will find a\r\nsynoptical and analytical table, with hyphens, brackets, each division\r\nbegetting its subdivisions, each subdivision its sections, each section\r\nits subsections: of the malady in general, of melancholy in particular,\r\nof its nature, its seat, its varieties, causes, symptoms, prognosis; of\r\nits cure by permissible means, by forbidden means, by dietetic means, by\r\npharmaceutical means. After the scholastic process, he descends from the\r\ngeneral to the particular, and disposes each emotion and idea in its\r\nlabelled case. In this framework, supplied by the Middle Ages, he heaps\r\nup the whole, like a man of the Renaissance--the literary description of\r\npassions and the medical description of madness, details of the hospital\r\nwith a satire on human follies, physiological treatises side by side\r\nwith personal confidences, the recipes of the apothecary with moral\r\ncounsels, remarks on love with the history of evacuations. The\r\ndiscrimination of ideas has not yet been effected; doctor and poet, man\r\nof letters and savant, he is all at once; for want of dams, ideas pour\r\nlike different liquids into the same vat, with strange spluttering and\r\nbubbling, with an unsavory smell and odd effect. But the vat is full,\r\nand from this admixture are produced potent compounds which no preceding\r\nage has known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Sir Thomas Browne\r\n\r\n\r\nFor in this mixture there is an effectual leaven, the poetic sentiment,\r\nwhich stirs up and animates the vast erudition, which will not be\r\nconfined to dry catalogues; which, interpreting every fact, every\r\nobject, disentangles or divines a mysterious soul within it, and\r\nagitates the whole mind of man, by representing to him the restless\r\nworld within and without him as a grand enigma. Let us conceive a\r\nkindred mind to Shakespeare's, a scholar and an observer instead of an\r\nactor and a poet, who in place of creating is occupied in comprehending,\r\nbut who, like Shakespeare, applies himself to living things, penetrates\r\ntheir internal structure, puts himself in communication with their\r\nactual laws, imprints in himself fervently and scrupulously the smallest\r\ndetails of their outward appearance; who at the same time extends his\r\npenetrating surmises beyond the region of observation, discerns behind\r\nvisible phenomena some world obscure yet sublime, and trembles with a\r\nkind of veneration before the vast, indistinct, but peopled darkness on\r\nwhose surface our little universe hangs quivering. Such a one is Sir\r\nThomas Browne, a naturalist, a philosopher, a scholar, a physician, and\r\na moralist, almost the last of the generation which produced Jeremy\r\nTaylor and Shakespeare. No thinker bears stronger witness to the\r\nwandering and inventive curiosity of the age. No writer has better\r\ndisplayed the brilliant and sombre imagination of the North. No one has\r\nspoken with a more eloquent emotion of death, the vast night of\r\nforgetfulness, of the all-devouring pit, of human vanity, which tries to\r\ncreate an ephemeral immortality out of glory or sculptured stones. No\r\none has revealed, in more glowing and original expressions, the poetic\r\nsap which flows through all the minds of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy, and deals\r\nwith the memory of men without distinction to merit of perpetuity. Who\r\ncan but pity the founder of the pyramids? Herostratus lives that burnt\r\nthe temple of Diana, he is almost lost that built it. Time hath spared\r\nthe epitaph of Adrian's horse, confounded that of himself. In vain we\r\ncompute our felicities by the advantage of our good names, since bad\r\nhave equal duration; and Thersites is like to live as long as Agamemnon.\r\nWho knows whether the best of men be known, or whether there be not more\r\nremarkable persons forgot than any that stand remembered in the known\r\naccount of time? Without the favour of the everlasting register, the\r\nfirst man had been as unknown as the last, and Methuselah's long life\r\nhad been his only chronicle.\r\n\r\n\"Oblivion is not to be hired. The greater part must be content to be as\r\nthough they had not been, to be found in the register of God, not in the\r\nrecord of man. Twenty-seven names make up the first story before the\r\nflood, and the recorded names ever since contain not one living century.\r\nThe number of the dead long exceedeth all that shall live. The night of\r\ntime far surpasseth the day, and who knows when was the equinox? Every\r\nhour adds unto the current arithmetick which scarce stands one moment.\r\nAnd since death must be the Lucina of life, and even Pagans could doubt,\r\nwhether thus to live were to die; since our longest sun sets at right\r\ndeclensions, and makes but winter arches, and therefore it cannot be\r\nlong before we lie down in darkness, and have our light in ashes; since\r\nthe brother of death daily haunts us with dying mementos, and time, that\r\ngrows old in itself, bids us hope no long duration;--diuturnity is a\r\ndream, and folly of expectation.\r\n\r\n\"Darkness and light divide the course of time, and oblivion shares with\r\nmemory a great part even of our living beings; we slightly remember our\r\nfelicities, and the smartest strokes of affliction leave but short smart\r\nupon us. Sense endureth no extremities, and sorrows destroy us or\r\nthemselves. To weep into stones are fables. Afflictions induce\r\ncallosities; miseries are slippery, or fall like snow upon us, which\r\nnotwithstanding is no unhappy stupidity. To be ignorant of evils to\r\ncome, and forgetful of evils past, is a merciful provision of nature,\r\nwhereby we digest the mixture of our few and evil days; and our\r\ndelivered senses not relapsing into cutting remembrances, our sorrows\r\nare not kept raw by the edge of repetitions.... All was vanity, feeding\r\nthe wind, and folly. The Egyptian mummies, which Cambyses or time hath\r\nspared, avarice now consumeth. Mummy is become merchandise, Mizraim\r\ncures wounds, and Pharaoh is sold for balsams.... Man is a noble animal,\r\nsplendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave, solemnizing nativities and\r\ndeaths with equal lustre, nor omitting ceremonies of bravery in the\r\ninfancy of his nature.... Pyramids, arches, obelisks, were but the\r\nirregularities of vain glory, and wild enormities of ancient\r\nmagnanimity.\"[382]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are almost the words of a poet, and it is just this poet's\r\nimagination which urges him onward into science.[383] Face to face with\r\nthe productions of nature he abounds in conjectures, comparisons; he\r\ngropes about, proposing explanations, making trials, extending his\r\nguesses like so many flexible and vibrating feelers into the four\r\ncorners of the globe, into the most distant regions, of fancy and truth.\r\nAs he looks upon the tree-like and foliaceous crusts which are formed\r\nupon the surface of freezing liquids, he asks himself if this be not a\r\nregeneration of vegetable essences, dissolved in the liquid. At the\r\nsight of curdling blood or milk, he inquires whether there be not\r\nsomething analogous to the formation of the bird in the egg, or to the\r\ncoagulation of chaos which gave birth to our world. In presence of that\r\nimpalpable force which makes liquids freeze, he asks if apoplexy and\r\ncataract are not the effects of a like power, and do not indicate also\r\nthe presence of a congealing agency. He is in presence of nature as an\r\nartist, a man of letters in presence of a living countenance, marking\r\nevery feature, every movement of physiognomy, so as to be able to divine\r\nthe passions and the inner disposition, ceaselessly correcting and\r\nundoing his interpretations, kept in agitation by thought of the\r\ninvisible forces which operate beneath the visible envelope. The whole\r\nof the Middle Ages and of antiquity, with their theories and\r\nimaginations, Platonism, Cabalism, Christian theology, Aristotle's\r\nsubstantial forms, the specific forms of the alchemists--all human\r\nspeculations, entangled and transformed one with the other, meet\r\nsimultaneously in his brain, so as to open up to him vistas of this\r\nunknown world. The accumulation, the pile, the confusion, the\r\nfermentation and the inner swarming, mingled with vapors and flashes,\r\nthe tumultuous overloading of his imagination and his mind, oppress and\r\nagitate him. In this expectation and emotion his curiosity takes hold of\r\neverything; in reference to the least fact, the most special, the most\r\nobsolete, the most chimerical, he conceives a chain of complicated\r\ninvestigations, calculating how the ark could contain all creatures,\r\nwith their provision of food; how Perpenna, at a banquet, arranged the\r\nguests so as to strike Sertorius; what trees must have grown on the\r\nbanks of Acheron, supposing that there were any; whether quincunx\r\nplantations had not their origin in Eden, and whether the numbers and\r\ngeometrical figures contained in the lozenge-form are not met with in\r\nall the productions of nature and art. You may recognize here the\r\nexuberance and the strange caprices of an inner development too ample\r\nand too strong. Archæology, chemistry, history, nature, there is\r\nnothing in which he is not passionately interested, which does not cause\r\nhis memory and his inventive powers to overflow, which does not summon\r\nup within him the idea of some force, certainly admirable, possibly\r\ninfinite. But what completes his picture, what signalizes the advance of\r\nscience, is the fact that his imagination provides a counterbalance\r\nagainst itself. He is as fertile in doubts as he is in explanations. If\r\nhe sees a thousand reasons which tend to one view, he sees also a\r\nthousand which tend to the contrary. At the two extremities of the same\r\nfact, he raises up to the clouds, but in equal piles, the scaffolding of\r\ncontradictory arguments. Having made a guess, he knows that it is but a\r\nguess; he pauses, ends with a perhaps, recommends verification. His\r\nwritings consist only of opinions, given as such; even his principal\r\nwork is a refutation of popular errors. In the main, he proposes\r\nquestions, suggests explanations, suspends his judgments, nothing more;\r\nbut this is enough; when the search is so eager, when the paths in which\r\nit proceeds are so numerous, when it is so scrupulous in securing its\r\nhold, the issue of the pursuit is sure; we are but a few steps from the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--Francis Bacon\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this band of scholars, dreamers, and inquirers, appears the most\r\ncomprehensive, sensible, originative of the minds of the age, Francis\r\nBacon, a great and luminous intellect, one of the finest of this poetic\r\nprogeny, who, like his predecessors, was naturally disposed to clothe\r\nhis ideas in the most splendid dress: in this age, a thought did not\r\nseem complete until it had assumed form and color. But what\r\ndistinguishes him from the others is, that with him an image only serves\r\nto concentrate meditation. He reflected long, stamped on his mind all\r\nthe parts and relations of his subject; he is master of it, and then,\r\ninstead of exposing this complete idea in a graduated chain of\r\nreasoning, he embodies it in a comparison so expressive, exact, lucid,\r\nthat behind the figure we perceive all the details of the idea, like\r\nliquor in a fine crystal vase. Judge of his style by a single example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For as water, whether it be the dew of Heaven or the springs of the\r\nearth, easily scatters and loses itself in the ground, except it be\r\ncollected into some receptacle, where it may by union and consort\r\ncomfort and sustain itself (and for that cause, the industry of man hath\r\ndevised aqueducts, cisterns, and pools, and likewise beautified them\r\nwith various ornaments of magnificence and state, as well as for use and\r\nnecessity); so this excellent liquor of knowledge, whether it descend\r\nfrom divine inspiration or spring from human sense, would soon perish\r\nand vanish into oblivion, if it were not preserved in books, traditions,\r\nconferences, and especially in places appointed for such matters as\r\nuniversities, colleges, and schools, where it may have both a fixed\r\nhabitation, and means and opportunity of increasing and collecting\r\nitself.\"[384]\r\n\r\n\"The greatest error of all the rest, is the mistaking or misplacing of\r\nthe last or farthest end of knowledge: for men have entered into a\r\ndesire of learning and knowledge, sometimes upon a natural curiosity and\r\ninquisitive appetite; sometimes to entertain their minds with variety\r\nand delight; sometimes for ornament and reputation; and sometimes to\r\nenable them to victory of wit and contradiction; and most times for\r\nlucre and profession; and seldom sincerely to give a true account of\r\ntheir gift of reason, to the benefit and use of men: as if there were\r\nsought in knowledge a couch whereupon to rest a searching and restless\r\nspirit; or a terrace, for a wandering and variable mind to walk up and\r\ndown with a fair prospect; or a tower of state, for a proud mind to\r\nraise itself upon; or a fort or commanding ground, for strife and\r\ncontention; or a shop, for profit or sale; and not a rich storehouse,\r\nfor the glory of the Creator, and the relief of man's estate.\"[385]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is his mode of thought, by symbols, not by analysis; instead of\r\nexplaining his idea, he transposes and translates it--translates it\r\nentire, to the smallest details, enclosing all in the majesty of a grand\r\nperiod, or in the brevity of a striking sentence. Thence springs a style\r\nof admirable richness, gravity, and vigor, now solemn and symmetrical,\r\nnow concise and piercing, always elaborate, and full of color.[386]\r\nThere is nothing in English prose superior to his diction.\r\n\r\nThence is derived also his manner of conceiving things. He is not a\r\ndialectician, like Hobbes or Descartes, apt in arranging ideas, in\r\neducing one from another, in leading his reader from the simple to the\r\ncomplex by an unbroken chain. He is a producer of conceptions and of\r\nsentences. The matter being explored, he says to us: \"Such it is; touch\r\nit not on that side; it must be approached from the other.\" Nothing\r\nmore; no proof, no effort to convince: he affirms, and does nothing\r\nmore; he has thought in the manner of artists and poets, and he speaks\r\nafter the manner of prophets and seers. _Cogitata et visa_ this title of\r\none of his books might be the title of all. The most admirable, the\r\n\"Novum Organum,\" is a string of aphorisms--a collection, as it were, of\r\nscientific decrees, as of an oracle who foresees the future and reveals\r\nthe truth. And to make the resemblance complete, he expresses them by\r\npoetical figures, by enigmatic abbreviations, almost in Sibylline\r\nverses: _Idola specûs, Idola tribûs, Idola fori, Idola theatri_,\r\neveryone will recall these strange names, by which he signifies the four\r\nkinds of illusions to which man is subject.[387] Shakespeare and the\r\nseers do not contain more vigorous or expressive condensations of\r\nthought, more resembling inspiration, and in Bacon they are to be found\r\neverywhere. On the whole, his process is that of the creators; it is\r\nintuition, not reasoning. When he has laid up his store of facts, the\r\ngreatest possible, on some vast subject, on some entire province of the\r\nmind, on the whole anterior philosophy, on the general condition of the\r\nsciences, on the power and limits of human reason, he casts over all\r\nthis a comprehensive view, as it were a great net, brings up a universal\r\nidea, condenses his idea into a maxim, and hands it to us with the\r\nwords, \"Verify and profit by it.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more hazardous, more like fantasy, than this mode of\r\nthought, when it is not checked by natural and good strong sense. This\r\ncommon-sense, which is a kind of natural divination, the stable\r\nequilibrium of an intellect always gravitating to the true, like the\r\nneedle to the pole, Bacon possesses in the highest degree. He has a\r\npre-eminently practical, even an utilitarian mind, such as we meet with\r\nlater in Bentham, and such as their business habits were to impress more\r\nand more upon the English. At the age of sixteen, while at the\r\nuniversity, he was dissatisfied with Aristotle's philosophy,[388] not\r\nthat he thought meanly of the author, whom, on the contrary, he calls a\r\ngreat genius; but because it seemed to him of no practical utility,\r\nincapable of producing works which might promote the well-being of men.\r\nWe see that from the outset he struck upon his dominant idea; all else\r\ncomes to him from this; a contempt for antecedent philosophy, the\r\nconception of a different system, the entire reformation of the sciences\r\nby the indication of a new goal, the definition of a distinct method,\r\nthe opening up of unsuspected anticipations.[389] It is never\r\nspeculation which he relishes, but the practical application of it. His\r\neyes are turned not to heaven, but to earth; not to things abstract and\r\nvain, but to things palpable and solid; not to curious, but to\r\nprofitable truths. He seeks to better the condition of men, to labor for\r\nthe welfare of mankind, to enrich human life with new discoveries and\r\nnew resources, to equip mankind with new powers and new instruments of\r\naction, His philosophy itself is but an instrument, _organum_, a sort of\r\nmachine or lever constructed to enable the intellect to raise a weight,\r\nto break through obstacles, to open up vistas, to accomplish tasks,\r\nwhich had hitherto surpassed its power. In his eyes, every special\r\nscience, like science in general, should be an implement. He invites\r\nmathematicians to quit their pure geometry, to study numbers only with a\r\nview to natural philosophy, to seek formulas only to calculate real\r\nquantities and natural motions. He recommends moralists to study the\r\nsoul, the passions, habits, temptations, not merely in a speculative\r\nway, but with a view to the cure or diminution of vice, and assigns to\r\nthe science of morals as its goal the amelioration of morals. For him,\r\nthe object of science is always the establishment of an art; that is,\r\nthe production of something of practical utility; when he wished to\r\ndescribe the efficacious nature of his philosophy by a tale, he\r\ndelineated in the \"New Atlantis,\" with a poet's boldness and the\r\nprecision of a seer, almost employing the very terms in use now, modern\r\napplications, and the present organization of the sciences, academies,\r\nobservatories, air-balloons, submarine vessels, the improvement of land,\r\nthe transmutation of species, regenerations, the discovery of remedies,\r\nthe preservation of food. The end of our foundation, says his principal\r\npersonage, is the knowledge of causes and secret motions of things, and\r\nthe enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all\r\nthings possible. And this \"possible\" is infinite.\r\n\r\nHow did this grand and just conception originate? Doubtless common-sense\r\nand genius, too, were necessary to its production; but neither\r\ncommon-sense nor genius was lacking to men: there had been more than one\r\nwho, observing, like Bacon, the progress of particular industries,\r\ncould, like him, have conceived of universal industry, and from certain\r\nlimited ameliorations have advanced to unlimited amelioration. Here we\r\nsee the power of connection; men think they do everything by their\r\nindividual thought, and they can do nothing without the assistance of\r\nthe thoughts of their neighbors; they fancy that they are following the\r\nsmall voice within them, but they only hear it because it is swelled by\r\nthe thousand buzzing and imperious voices, which, issuing from all\r\nsurrounding or distant circumstances, are confounded with it in an\r\nharmonious vibration. Generally they hear it, as Bacon did, from the\r\nfirst moment of reflection; but it had become inaudible among the\r\nopposing sounds which came from without to smother it. Could this\r\nconfidence in the infinite enlargement of human power, this glorious\r\nidea of the universal conquest of nature, this firm hope in the\r\ncontinual increase of well-being and happiness, have germinated, grown,\r\noccupied an intelligence entirely, and thence have struck its roots,\r\nbeen propagated and spread over neighboring intelligences, in a time of\r\ndiscouragement and decay, when men believed the end of the world at\r\nhand, when things were falling into ruin about them, when Christian\r\nmysticism, as in the first centuries, ecclesiastical tyranny, as in the\r\nfourteenth century, were convincing them of their impotence, by\r\nperverting their intellectual efforts and curtailing their liberty. On\r\nthe contrary, such hopes must then have seemed to be outbursts of pride,\r\nor suggestions of the carnal mind. They did seem so; and the last\r\nrepresentatives of ancient science, and the first of the new, were\r\nexiled or imprisoned, assassinated or burned. In order to be developed\r\nan idea must be in harmony with surrounding civilization; before man can\r\nexpect to attain the dominion over nature, or attempts to improve his\r\ncondition, amelioration must have begun on all sides, industries have\r\nincreased, knowledge have been accumulated, the arts expanded, a hundred\r\nthousand irrefutable witnesses must have come incessantly to give proof\r\nof his power and assurance of his progress. The \"masculine birth of the\r\ntime\" (_temporis partus masculus_) is the title which Bacon applies to\r\nhis work, and it is a true one. In fact, the whole age co-operated in\r\nit; by this creation it was finished. The consciousness of human power\r\nand prosperity gave to the Renaissance its first energy, its ideal, its\r\npoetic materials, its distinguishing features; and now it furnishes it\r\nwith its final expression, its scientific doctrine, and its ultimate\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nWe may add also, its method. For, the end of a journey once determined,\r\nthe route is laid down, since the end always determines the route; when\r\nthe point to be reached is changed, the path of approach is changed, and\r\nscience, varying its object, varies also its method. So long as it\r\nlimited its effort to the satisfying an idle curiosity, opening out\r\nspeculative vistas, establishing a sort of opera in speculative minds,\r\nit could launch out any moment into metaphysical abstractions and\r\ndistinctions: it was enough for it to skim over experience; it soon\r\nquitted it, and came all at once upon great words, quiddities, the\r\nprinciple of individuation, final causes. Half proofs sufficed science;\r\nat bottom it did not care to establish a truth, but to get an opinion;\r\nand its instrument, the syllogism, was serviceable only for refutations,\r\nnot for discoveries; it took general laws for a starting-point instead\r\nof a point of arrival; instead of going to find them, it fancied them\r\nfound. The syllogism was good in the schools, not in nature; it made\r\ndisputants, not discoverers. From the moment that science had art for an\r\nend, and men studied in order to act, all was transformed; for we cannot\r\nact without certain and precise knowledge. Forces, before they can be\r\nemployed, must be measured and verified; before we can build a house, we\r\nmust know exactly the resistance of the beams, or the house will\r\ncollapse; before we can cure a sick man, we must know with certainty the\r\neffect of a remedy, or the patient will die. Practice makes certainty\r\nand exactitude a necessity to science, because practice is impossible\r\nwhen it has nothing to lean upon but guesses and approximations. How can\r\nwe eliminate guesses and approximations? How introduce into science,\r\nsolidity and precision? We must imitate the cases in which science,\r\nissuing in practice, has proved to be precise and certain, and these\r\ncases are the industries. We must, as in the industries, observe, essay,\r\ngrope about, verify, keep our mind fixed on sensible and particular\r\nthings, advance to general rules only step by step; not anticipate\r\nexperience, but follow it; not imagine nature, but interpret it. For\r\nevery general effect, such as heat, whiteness, hardness, liquidity, we\r\nmust seek a general condition, so that in producing the condition we may\r\nproduce the effect. And for this it is necessary, by fit rejections and\r\nexclusions, to extract the condition sought from the heap of facts in\r\nwhich it lies buried, construct the table of cases from which the effect\r\nis absent, the table where it is present, the table where the effect is\r\nshown in various degrees, so as to isolate and bring to light the\r\ncondition which produced it.[390] Then we shall have, not useless\r\nuniversal axioms, but efficacious mediate axioms, true laws from which\r\nwe can derive works, and which are the sources of power in the same\r\ndegree as the sources of light.[391] Bacon described and predicted in\r\nthis modern science and industry, their correspondence, method,\r\nresources, principle; and after more than two centuries it is still to\r\nhim that we go even at the present day to look for the theory of what we\r\nare attempting and doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOICE EXAMPLES OF EARLY PRINTING AND ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\nFac-similes from Rare and Curious Books.\r\n\r\n_THE NEW PSALTER OF THE VIRGIN MARY._\r\n\r\nThe \"Novum Beatæ Mariæ Virginis Psalterium\" was printed by the\r\nCistercians monks of the monastery of Sienna, in the duchy of Magdeburg,\r\nnear Wittemberg, in 1492. The present illustration shows the page of\r\ndedication, in which mention is made of the Emperor Frederick, whose\r\narms, the double-headed eagle, appears in the border. The book was\r\nprinted in the year before the emperor died. The border is an easy and\r\nflowing design of roses, which are always considered an emblem of the\r\nVirgin. The volume is a remarkable production, rare and much prized by\r\ncollectors.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this great view, he has discovered nothing. Cowley, one of his\r\nadmirers, rightly said that, like Moses on Mount Pisgah, he was the\r\nfirst to announce the promised land; but he might have added quite as\r\njustly, that, like Moses, he did not enter there. He pointed out the\r\nroute, but did not travel it; he taught men how to discover natural\r\nlaws, but discovered none. His definition of heat is extremely\r\nimperfect. His \"Natural History\" is full of fanciful explanations.[392]\r\nLike the poets, he peoples nature with instincts and desires; attributes\r\nto bodies an actual voracity, to the atmosphere a thirst for light,\r\nsounds, odors, vapors which it drinks in; to metals a sort of haste to\r\nbe incorporated with acids. He explains the duration of the bubbles of\r\nair which float on the surface of liquids, by supposing that air has a\r\nvery small or no appetite for height. He sees in every quality, weight,\r\nductility, hardness, a distinct essence which has its special cause; so\r\nthat when a man knows the cause of every quality of gold, he will be\r\nable to put all these causes together, and make gold. In the main, with\r\nthe alchemists, Paracelsus and Gilbert, Kepler himself, with all the men\r\nof his time, men of imagination, nourished on Aristotle, he represents\r\nnature as a compound of secret and living energies, inexplicable and\r\nprimordial forces, distinct and indecomposable essences, adapted each by\r\nthe will of the Creator to produce a distinct effect. He almost saw\r\nsouls endowed with latent repugnances and occult inclinations, which\r\naspire to or resist certain directions, certain mixtures, and certain\r\nlocalities. On this account also he confounds everything in his\r\nresearches in an undistinguishable mass, vegetative and medicinal\r\nproperties, mechanical and curative, physical and moral, without\r\nconsidering the most complex as depending on the simplest, but each on\r\nthe contrary in itself, and taken apart, as an irreducible and\r\nindependent existence. Obstinate in this error, the thinkers of the age\r\nmark time without advancing. They see clearly with Bacon the wide field\r\nof discovery, but they cannot enter upon it. They want an idea, and for\r\nwant of this idea they do not advance. The disposition of mind which but\r\nnow was a lever, is become an obstacle: it must be changed, that the\r\nobstacle may be got rid of. For ideas, I mean great and efficacious\r\nones, do not come at will nor by chance, by the effort of an individual,\r\nor by a happy accident. Methods and philosophies, as well as literatures\r\nand religions, arise from the spirit of the age; and this spirit of the\r\nage makes them potent or powerless. One state of public intelligence\r\nexcludes a certain kind of literature; another, a certain scientific\r\nconception. When it happens thus, writers and thinkers labor in vain,\r\nthe literature is abortive, the conception does not make its appearance.\r\nIn vain they turn one way and another, trying to remove the weight which\r\nhinders them; something stronger than themselves paralyzes their hands\r\nand frustrates their endeavors. The central pivot of the vast wheel on\r\nwhich human affairs move must be displaced one notch, that all may move\r\nwith its motion. At this moment the pivot was moved, and thus a\r\nrevolution of the great wheel begins, bringing round a new conception of\r\nnature, and in consequence that part of the method which was lacking. To\r\nthe diviners, the creators, the comprehensive and impassioned minds who\r\nseized objects in a lump and in masses, succeeded the discursive\r\nthinkers, the systematic thinkers, the graduated and clear logicians,\r\nwho, disposing ideas in continuous series, lead the hearer gradually\r\nfrom the simple to the most complex by easy and unbroken paths.\r\nDescartes superseded Bacon; the classical age obliterated the\r\nRenaissance; poetry and lofty imagination gave way before rhetoric,\r\neloquence, and analysis. In this transformation of mind, ideas were\r\ntransformed. Everything was drained dry and simplified. The universe,\r\nlike all else, was reduced to two or three notions; and the conception\r\nof nature, which was poetical, became mechanical. Instead of souls,\r\nliving forces, repugnances, and attractions, we have pulleys, levers,\r\nimpelling forces. The world, which seemed a mass of instinctive powers,\r\nis now like a mere machinery of cog-wheels. Beneath this adventurous\r\nsupposition lies a large and certain truth; that there is, namely, a\r\nscale of facts, some at the summit very complex, others at the base very\r\nsimple; those above having their origin in those below, so that the\r\nlower ones explain the higher; and that we must seek the primary laws of\r\nthings in the laws of motion. The search was made, and Galileo found\r\nthem. Thenceforth the work of the Renaissance, outstripping the extreme\r\npoint to which Bacon had pushed it, and at which he had left it, was\r\nable to proceed onward by itself, and did so proceed, without limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: See, at Bruges, the pictures of Hemling (fifteenth\r\ncentury).

Forty\r\npoets, amongst them ten of superior rank, as well as one, the greatest\r\nof all artists who have represented the soul in words; many hundreds of\r\npieces, and nearly fifty masterpieces; the drama extended over all the\r\nprovinces of history, imagination, and fancy--expanded so as to embrace\r\ncomedy, tragedy, pastoral and fanciful literature--to represent all\r\ndegrees of human condition, and all the caprices of human invention--to\r\nexpress all the perceptible details of actual truth, and all the\r\nphilosophic grandeur of general reflection; the stage disencumbered of\r\nall precept and freed from all imitation, given up and appropriated in\r\nthe minutest particulars to the reigning taste and public intelligence;\r\nall this was a vast and manifold work, capable by its flexibility, its\r\ngreatness, and its form, of receiving and preserving the exact imprint\r\nof the age and of the nation.[393]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--The Public and the Stage\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us try, then, to set before our eyes this public, this audience, and\r\nthis stage--all connected with one another, as in every natural and\r\nliving work; and if ever there was a living and natural work, it is\r\nhere. There were already seven theatres in London, in Shakespeare's\r\ntime, so brisk and universal was the taste for dramatic representations.\r\nGreat and rude contrivances, awkward in their construction, barbarous in\r\ntheir appointments; but a fervid imagination readily supplied all that\r\nthey lacked, and hardy bodies endured all inconveniences without\r\ndifficulty. On a dirty site, on the banks of the Thames, rose the\r\nprincipal theatre, the Globe, a sort of hexagonal tower, surrounded by a\r\nmuddy ditch, on which was hoisted a red flag. The common people could\r\nenter as well as the rich: there were sixpenny, twopenny, even penny\r\nseats; but they could not see it without money. If it rained, and it\r\noften rains in London, the people in the pit, butchers, mercers, bakers,\r\nsailors, apprentices, receive the streaming rain upon their heads. I\r\nsuppose they did not trouble themselves about it; it was not so long\r\nsince they began to pave the streets of London; and when men, like\r\nthese, have had experience of sewers and puddles, they are not afraid of\r\ncatching cold. While waiting for the piece, they amuse themselves after\r\ntheir fashion, drink beer, crack nuts, eat fruit, howl, and now and then\r\nresort to their lists; they have been known to fall upon the actors, and\r\nturn the theatre upside down. At other times they were dissatisfied and\r\nwent to the tavern to give the poet a hiding, or toss him in a blanket;\r\nthey were coarse fellows, and there was no month when the cry of \"Clubs\"\r\ndid not call them out of their shops to exercise their brawny arms. When\r\nthe beer took effect, there was a great upturned barrel in the pit, a\r\npeculiar receptacle for general use. The smell rises, and then comes the\r\ncry, \"Burn the juniper!\" They burn some in a plate on the stage, and the\r\nheavy smoke fills the air. Certainly the folk there assembled could\r\nscarcely get disgusted at anything, and cannot have had sensitive noses.\r\nIn the time of Rabelais there was not much cleanliness to speak of.\r\nRemember that they were hardly out of the Middle Ages and that in the\r\nMiddle Ages man lived on a dunghill.\r\n\r\nAbove them, on the stage, were the spectators able to pay a shilling,\r\nthe elegant people, the gentlefolk. These were sheltered from the rain,\r\nand if they chose to pay an extra shilling, could have a stool. To this\r\nwere reduced the prerogatives of rank and the devices of comfort: it\r\noften happened that there were not stools enough; then they lie down on\r\nthe ground: this was not a time to be dainty. They play cards, smoke,\r\ninsult the pit, who gave it them back without stinting, and throw apples\r\nat them into the bargain. They also gesticulate, swear in Italian,\r\nFrench, English;[394] crack aloud jokes in dainty, composite, high-colored\r\nwords: in short, they have the energetic, original, gay manners of\r\nartists, the same humor, the same absence of constraint, and, to\r\ncomplete the resemblance, the same desire to make themselves singular,\r\nthe same imaginative cravings, the same absurd and picturesque devices,\r\nbeards cut to a point, into the shape of a fan, a spade, the letter T,\r\ngaudy and expensive dresses, copied from five or six neighboring\r\nnations, embroidered, laced with gold, motley, continually heightened in\r\neffect or changed for others: there was, as it were, a carnival in their\r\nbrains as well as on their backs.\r\n\r\nWith such spectators illusions could be produced without much trouble:\r\nthere were no preparations or perspectives; few or no movable scenes:\r\ntheir imaginations took all this upon them. A scroll in big letters\r\nannounced to the public that they were in London or Constantinople; and\r\nthat was enough to carry the public to the desired place. There was no\r\ntrouble about probability. Sir Philip Sidney writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You shall have Asia of the one side, and Africke of the other, and so\r\nmany other under-kingdomes, that the Plaier when hee comes in, must ever\r\nbegin with telling where hee is, or else the tale will not be conceived.\r\nNow shall you have three Ladies walke to gather flowers, and then wee\r\nmust beleeve the stage to be a garden. By and by wee heare newes of\r\nshipwracke in the same place, then wee are to blame if we accept it not\r\nfor a rocke;... while in the meane time two armies flie in, represented\r\nwith foure swordes and bucklers, and then what hard heart will not\r\nreceive it for a pitched field? Now of time they are much more liberall.\r\nFor ordinary it is, that two young Princes fall in love, after many\r\ntraverses, shee is got with childe, delivered of a faire boy, hee is\r\nlost, groweth a man, falleth in love, and is readie to get another\r\nchilde; and all this in two hours space.\"[395]\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless these enormities were somewhat reduced under Shakespeare; with\r\na few hangings, crude representations of animals, towers, forests, they\r\nassisted somewhat the public imagination. But after all, in\r\nShakespeare's plays, as in all others, the imagination from within is\r\nchiefly drawn upon for the machinery; it must lend itself to all,\r\nsubstitute all, accept for a queen a young man who has just been shaved,\r\nendure in one act ten changes of place, leap suddenly over twenty years\r\nor five hundred miles,[396] take half a dozen supernumeraries for forty\r\nthousand men, and to have represented by the rolling of the drums all\r\nthe battles of Caesar, Henry V, Coriolanus, Richard III. And\r\nimagination, being so overflowing and so young, accepts all this. Recall\r\nyour own youth; for my part, the deepest emotions I have ever felt at a\r\ntheatre were given to me by a strolling bevy of four young girls,\r\nplaying comedy and tragedy on a stage in a coffee-house; true, I was\r\neleven years old. So in this theatre, at this moment, their souls were\r\nfresh, as ready to feel everything as the poet was to dare everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--Manners of the Sixteenth Century\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are but externals; let us try to advance further, to observe the\r\npassions, the bent of mind, the inner man: it is this inner state which\r\nraised and modelled the drama, as everything else; invisible\r\ninclinations are everywhere the cause of visible works, and the interior\r\nshapes the exterior. What are these townspeople, courtiers, this public,\r\nwhose taste fashions the theatre? what is there peculiar in the\r\nstructure and condition of their minds? The condition must needs be\r\npeculiar; for the drama flourishes all of a sudden, and for sixty years\r\ntogether, with marvellous luxuriance, and at the end of this time is\r\narrested so that no effort could ever revive it. The structure must be\r\npeculiar; for of all theatres, old and new, this is distinct in form,\r\nand displays a style, action, characters, an idea of life, which are not\r\nfound in any age or any country beside. This particular feature is the\r\nfree and complete expansion of nature.\r\n\r\nWhat we call nature in men is, man such as he was before culture and\r\ncivilization had deformed and reformed him. Almost always, when a new\r\ngeneration arrives at manhood and consciousness, it finds a code of\r\nprecepts impose on it with all the weight and authority of antiquity. A\r\nhundred kinds of chains, a hundred thousand kinds of ties, religion,\r\nmorality, good breeding, every legislation which regulates sentiments,\r\nmorals, manners, fetter and tame the creature of impulse and passion\r\nwhich breathes and frets within each of us. There is nothing like that\r\nhere. It is a regeneration, and the curb of the past is wanting to the\r\npresent. Catholicism, reduced to external ceremony and clerical\r\nchicanery, had just ended; Protestantism, arrested in its first gropings\r\nafter truth, or straying into sects, had not yet gained the mastery; the\r\nreligion of discipline was grown feeble, and the religion of morals was\r\nnot yet established; men ceased to listen to the directions of the\r\nclergy, and has not yet spelled out the law of conscience. The church\r\nwas turned into an assembly-room, as in Italy; the young fellows came to\r\nSt. Paul's to walk, laugh, chatter, display their new cloaks; the thing\r\nhad even passed into a custom. They paid for the noise they made with\r\ntheir spurs, and this tax was a source of income to the canons;[397]\r\npickpockets, loose girls, came there by crowds; these latter struck\r\ntheir bargains while service was going on. Imagine, in short, that the\r\nscruples of conscience and the severity of the Puritans were at that\r\ntime odious and ridiculed on the stage, and judge of the difference\r\nbetween this sensual, unbridled England, and the correct, disciplined,\r\nstiff England of our own time. Ecclesiastical or secular, we find no\r\nsigns of rule. In the failure of faith, reason had not gained sway, and\r\nopinion is as void of authority as tradition. The imbecile age, which\r\nhas just ended, continues buried in scorn, with its ravings, its\r\nverse-makers, and its pedantic text-books; and out of the liberal\r\nopinions derived from antiquity, from Italy, France, and Spain, everyone\r\ncould pick and choose as it pleased him, without stooping to restraint\r\nor acknowledging a superiority. There was no model imposed on them, as\r\nnowadays; instead of affecting imitation, they affected\r\noriginality.[398] Each strove to be himself, with his own oaths,\r\npeculiar ways, costumes, his specialties of conduct and humor, and to be\r\nunlike everyone else. They said not, \"So and so is done,\" but \"I do so\r\nand so.\" Instead of restraining, they gave free vent to themselves.\r\nThere was no etiquette of society; save for an exaggerated jargon of\r\nchivalresque courtesy, they are masters of speech and action on the\r\nimpulse of the moment. You will find them free from decorum, as of all\r\nelse. In this outbreak and absence of fetters, they resemble fine strong\r\nhorses let loose in the meadow. Their inborn instincts have not been\r\ntamed, nor muzzled, nor diminished.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, they have been preserved intact by bodily and military\r\ntraining; and escaping as they were from barbarism, not from\r\ncivilization, they had not been acted upon by the innate softening and\r\nhereditary tempering which are new transmitted with the blood, and\r\ncivilize a man from the moment of his birth. This is why man, who for\r\nthree centuries has been a domestic animal, was still almost a savage\r\nbeast, and the force of his muscles and the strength of his nerves\r\nincreased the boldness and energy of his passions. Look at these\r\nuncultivated men, men of the people, how suddenly the blood warms and\r\nrises to their face; their fists double, their lips press together, and\r\nthose vigorous bodies rush at once into action. The courtiers of that\r\nage were like our men of the people. They had the same taste for the\r\nexercise of their limbs, the same indifference toward the inclemencies\r\nof the weather, the same coarseness of language, the same undisguised\r\nsensuality. They were carmen in body and gentlemen in sentiment, with\r\nthe dress of actors and the tastes of artists. \"At fourtene,\" says John\r\nHardyng, \"a lordes sonnes shalle to felde hunte the dere, and catch an\r\nhardynesse. For dere to hunte and slea, and see them blede, ane\r\nhardyment gyffith to his courage.... At sextene yere, to werray and to\r\nwage, to juste and ryde, and castels to assayle... and every day his\r\narmure to assay in fete of armes with some of his meyne.\"[399] When\r\nripened to manhood, he is employed with the bow, in wrestling, leaping,\r\nvaulting. Henry VII's court, in its noisy merriment, was like a village\r\nfair. The king, says Holinshed, exercised himself \"dailie in shooting,\r\nsinging, dancing, wrestling, casting of the barre, plaieing at the\r\nrecorders, flute, virginals, in setting of songs, and making of\r\nballads.\" He leaps the moats with a pole, and was once within an ace of\r\nbeing killed. He is so fond of wrestling, that publicly, on the field of\r\nthe Cloth of Gold, he seized Francis I in his arms to try a throw with\r\nhim. This is how a common soldier or a bricklayer nowadays tries a new\r\ncomrade. In fact, they regarded gross jests and brutal buffooneries as\r\namusements, as soldiers and bricklayers do now. In every nobleman's\r\nhouse there was a fool, whose business it was to utter pointed jests, to\r\nmake eccentric gestures, horrible faces, to sing licentious songs, as we\r\nmight hear now in a beer-house. They thought insults and obscenity a\r\njoke. They were foul-mouthed, they listened to Rabelais's words\r\nundiluted, and delighted in conversation which would revolt us. They had\r\nno respect for humanity; the rules of proprieties and the habits of good\r\nbreeding began only under Louis XIV, and by imitation of the French; at\r\nthis time they all blurted out the word that fitted in, and that was\r\nmost frequently a coarse word. You will see on the stage, in\r\nShakespeare's \"Pericles,\" the filth of a haunt of vice.[400] The great\r\nlords, the well-dressed ladies, speak billingsgate. When Henry V pays\r\nhis court to Catherine of France, it is with the coarse bearing of a\r\nsailor who may have taken a fancy to a sutler; and like the tars who\r\ntattoo a heart on their arms to prove their love for the girls they left\r\nbehind them, there were men who \"devoured sulphur and drank urine\"[401]\r\nto win their mistress by a proof of affection. Humanity is as much\r\nlacking as decency.[402] Blood, suffering, does not move them. The court\r\nfrequents bear and bull baitings, where dogs are ripped up and chained\r\nbeasts are sometimes beaten to death, and it was, says an officer of the\r\npalace, \"a charming entertainment.\"[403] No wonder they used their arms\r\nlike clodhoppers and gossips. Elizabeth used to beat her maids of honor,\r\n\"so that these beautiful girls could often be heard crying and lamenting\r\nin a piteous manner.\" One day she spat upon Sir Mathew's fringed coat;\r\nat another time, when Essex, whom she was scolding, turned his back, she\r\ngave him a box on the ear. It was then the practice of great ladies to\r\nbeat their children and their servants. Poor Jane Grey was sometimes so\r\nwretchedly \"boxed, struck, pinched, and ill-treated in other manners\r\nwhich she dare not relate,\" that she used to wish herself dead. Their\r\nfirst idea is to come to words, to blows, to have satisfaction. As in\r\nfeudal times, they appeal at once to arms, and retain the habit of\r\ntaking the law in their own hands, and without delay. \"On Thursday\r\nlaste,\" writes Gilbert Talbot to the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury,\r\n\"as my Lorde Rytche was rydynge in the streates, there was one Wyndam\r\nthat stode in a dore, and shotte a dagge at him, thynkynge to have\r\nslayne him. ... The same daye, also, as Sr John Conway was goynge in the\r\nstreetes, Mr. Lodovyke Grevell came sodenly upon him, and stroke him on\r\nthe hedd wth a sworde.... I am forced to trouble yor Honors wth thes\r\ntryflynge matters, for I know no greater.\"[404] No one, not even the\r\nqueen, is safe among these violent dispositions.[405] Again, when one\r\nman struck another in the precincts of the court, his hand was cut off,\r\nand the arteries stopped with a red-hot iron. Only such atrocious\r\nimitations of their own crimes, and the painful image of bleeding and\r\nsuffering flesh, could tame their vehemence and restrain the uprising of\r\ntheir instincts. Judge now what materials they furnish to the theatre,\r\nand what characters they look for at the theatre. To please the public,\r\nthe stage cannot deal too much in open lust and the strongest passions;\r\nit must depict man attaining the limit of his desires, unchecked, almost\r\nmad, now trembling and rooted before the white palpitating flesh which\r\nhis eyes devour, now haggard and grinding his teeth before the enemy\r\nwhom he wishes to tear to pieces, now carried beyond himself and\r\noverwhelmed at the sight of the honors and wealth which he covets,\r\nalways raging and enveloped in a tempest of eddying ideas, sometimes\r\nshaken by impetuous joy, more often on the verge of fury and madness,\r\nstronger, more ardent, more daringly let loose to infringe on reason and\r\nlaw than ever. We hear from the stage as from the history of the time,\r\nthese fierce murmurs: the sixteenth century is like a den of lions.\r\n\r\nAmid passions so strong as these there is not one lacking. Nature\r\nappears here in all its violence, but also in all its fulness. If\r\nnothing had been weakened, nothing had been mutilated. It is the entire\r\nman who is displayed, heart, mind, body, senses, with his noblest and\r\nfinest aspirations, as with his most bestial and savage appetites,\r\nwithout the preponderance of any dominant circumstance to cast him\r\naltogether in one direction, to exalt or degrade him. He has not become\r\nrigid, as he will be under Puritanism. He is not uncrowned as in the\r\nRestoration. After the hollowness and weariness of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, he rose up by a second birth, as before in Greece man had risen\r\nby a first birth; and now, as then, the temptations of the outer world\r\ncame combined to raise his faculties from their sloth and torpor. A sort\r\nof generous warmth spread over them to ripen and make them flourish.\r\nPeace, prosperity, comfort began; new industries and increasing activity\r\nsuddenly multiplied objects of utility and luxury tenfold. America and\r\nIndia, by their discovery, caused the treasures and prodigies heaped up\r\nafar over distant seas to shine before their eyes; antiquity\r\nrediscovered, sciences mapped out, the Reformation begun, books\r\nmultiplied by printing, ideas by books, doubled the means of enjoyment,\r\nimagination, and thought. People wanted to enjoy, to imagine, and to\r\nthink; for the desire grows with the attraction, and here all\r\nattractions were combined. There were attractions for the senses, in the\r\nchambers which they began to warm, in the beds newly furnished with\r\npillows, in the coaches which they began to use for the first time.\r\nThere were attractions for the senses, in the chambers which they began\r\nto warm, in the beds newly furnished with pillows, in the coaches which\r\nthey began to use for the first time. There were attractions for the\r\nimagination in the new palaces, arranged after the Italian manner; in\r\nthe variegated hangings from Flanders; in the rich garments,\r\ngold-embroidered, which, being continually changed, combined the fancies\r\nand the splendors of all Europe. There were attractions for the mind, in\r\nthe noble and beautiful writings which, spread abroad, translated,\r\nexplained, brought in philosophy, eloquence, and poetry, from restored\r\nantiquity, and from the surrounding renaissances. Under this appeal all\r\naptitudes and instincts at once started up; the low and the lofty, ideal\r\nand sensual love, gross cupidity and pure generosity. Recall what you\r\nyourself experienced, when from being a child you became a man: what\r\nwishes for happiness, what breadth of anticipation, what intoxication of\r\nheart wafted you towards all joys; with what impulse your hands seized\r\ninvoluntarily and all at once every branch of the tree, and would not\r\nlet a single fruit escape. At sixteen years, like Chérubin,[406] we\r\nwish for a servant girl while we adore a Madonna; we are capable of\r\nevery species of covetousness, and also of every species of self-denial;\r\nwe find virtue more lovely, our meals more enjoyable; pleasure has more\r\nzest, heroism more worth: there is no allurement which is not keen; the\r\nsweetness and novelty of things are too strong; and in the hive of\r\npassions which buzzes within us, and stings us like the sting of a bee,\r\nwe can do nothing but plunge, one after another, in all directions. Such\r\nwere the men of this time, Raleigh, Essex, Elizabeth, Henry VIII\r\nhimself, excessive and inconstant, ready for devotion and for crime,\r\nviolent in good and evil, heroic with strange weaknesses, humble with\r\nsudden changes of mood, never vile with premeditation like the\r\nroisterers of the Restoration, never rigid on principle like the\r\nPuritans of the Revolution, capable of weeping like children,[407] and\r\nof dying like men, often base courtiers, more than once true knights,\r\ndisplaying constantly, amidst all these contradictions of bearing, only\r\nthe fulness of their characters. Thus prepared, they could take in\r\neverything, sanguinary ferocity and refined generosity, the brutality of\r\nshameless debauchery, and the most divine innocence of love, accept all\r\nthe characters, prostitutes and virgins, princes and mountebanks, pass\r\nquickly from trivial buffoonery to lyrical sublimities, listen\r\nalternately to the quibbles of clowns and the songs of lovers. The drama\r\neven, in order to imitate and satisfy the fertility of their nature,\r\nmust talk all tongues, pompous, inflated verse, loaded with imagery, and\r\nside by side with this, vulgar prose: more, it must distort its natural\r\nstyle and limits; put songs, poetical devices, into the discourse of\r\ncourtiers and the speeches of statesmen; bring on the stage the fairy\r\nworld of the opera, as Middleton says, gnomes, nymphs of the land and\r\nsea, with their groves and their meadows; compel the gods to descend\r\nupon the stage, and hell itself to furnish its world of marvels. No\r\nother theatre is so complicated; for nowhere else do we find men so\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Some Aspects of the English Mind\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this free and universal expansion, the passions had their special\r\nbent withal, which was an English one, inasmuch as they were English.\r\nAfter all, in every age, under every civilization, a people is always\r\nitself. Whatever be its dress, goat-skin blouse, gold-laced doublet,\r\nblack dress-coat, the five or six great instincts which it possessed in\r\nits forests, follow it in its palaces and offices. To this day, warlike\r\npassions, a gloomy humor, subsist under the regularity and propriety of\r\nmodern manners.[408] Their native energy and harshness pierce through\r\nthe perfection of culture and the habits of comfort. Rich young men, on\r\nleaving Oxford, go to hunt bears on the Rocky Mountains, the elephant in\r\nSouth Africa, live under canvas, box, jump hedges on horseback, sail\r\ntheir yachts on dangerous coasts, delight in solitude and peril. The\r\nancient Saxon, the old rover of the Scandinavian seas, has not perished.\r\nEven at school the children roughly treat one another, withstand one\r\nanother, fight like men; and their character is so indomitable that they\r\nneed the birch and blows to reduce them to the discipline of law. Judge\r\nwhat they were in the sixteenth century; the English race passed then\r\nfor the most warlike of Europe, the most redoubtable in battle, the most\r\nimpatient of anything like slavery.[409] \"English savages\" is what\r\nCellini calls them; and the \"great shins of beef\" with which they fill\r\nthemselves, keep up the force and ferocity of their instincts. To harden\r\nthem thoroughly, institutions work in the same groove with nature. The\r\nnation is armed, every man is brought up like a soldier, bound to have\r\narms according to his condition, to exercise himself on Sundays or\r\nholidays; from the yeoman to the lord, the old military constitution\r\nkeeps them enrolled and ready for action.[410] In a state which\r\nresembles an army it is necessary that punishments, as in an army, shall\r\ninspire terror; and to make them worse, the hideous Wars of the Roses,\r\nwhich on every flaw of the succession to the throne are ready to break\r\nout again, are ever present in their recollection. Such instincts, such\r\na constitution, such a history, raise before them, with tragic severity,\r\nan idea of life: death is at hand, as well as wounds, the block,\r\ntortures. The fine cloaks of purple which the renaissances of the South\r\ndisplayed joyfully in the sun, to wear like a holiday garment, are here\r\nstained with blood, and edged with black. Throughout,[411] a stern\r\ndiscipline, and the axe ready for every suspicion of treason; great men,\r\nbishops, a chancellor, princes, the king's relatives, queens, a\r\nprotector, all kneeling in the straw, sprinkled the Tower with their\r\nblood; one after the other they marched past, stretched out their necks;\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham, Queen Anne Boleyn, Queen Catherine Howard, the\r\nEarl of Surrey, Admiral Seymour, the Duke of Somerset, Lady Jane Grey\r\nand her husband, the Duke of Northumberland, Mary Stuart, the Earl of\r\nEssex, all on the throne, or on the steps of the throne, in the highest\r\nrank of honors, beauty, youth, and genius; of the bright procession\r\nnothing is left but senseless trunks, marred by the tender mercies of\r\nthe executioner. Shall I count the funeral pyres, the hangings, living\r\nmen cut down from the gibbet, disembowelled, quartered,[412] their limbs\r\ncast into the fire, their heads exposed on the walls? There is a page in\r\nHolinshed which reads like a death register:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The five and twentith daie of Maie (1535), was in saint Paules church\r\nat London examined nineteene men and six women born in Holland, whose\r\nopinions were (heretical). Fourteene of them were condemned, a man and a\r\nwoman of them were burned in Smithfield, the other twelve were sent to\r\nother townes, there to be burnt. On the nineteenth of June were three\r\nmoonkes of the Charterhouse hanged, drawne, and quartered at Tiburne,\r\nand their heads and quarters set up about London, for denieng the king\r\nto be supreme head of the church. Also the one and twentith of the same\r\nmoneth, and for the same cause, doctor John Fisher, bishop of Rochester,\r\nwas beheaded for denieng of the supremacie, and his head set upon London\r\nbridge, but his bodie buried within Barking churchyard. The pope had\r\nelected him a cardinall, and sent his hat as far as Calais, but his head\r\nwas off before his hat was on: so that they met not. On the sixt of\r\nJulie, was Sir Thomas Moore beheaded for the like crime, that is to wit,\r\nfor denieng the king to be supreme head.\"[413]\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of these murders seem extraordinary; the chroniclers mention them\r\nwithout growing indignant; the condemned go quietly to the block, as if\r\nthe thing were perfectly natural. Anne Boleyn said seriously, before\r\ngiving up her head to the executioner: \"I praie God save the king, and\r\nsend him long to reigne over you, for a gentler, nor a more merciful\r\nprince was there never.\"[414] Society is, as it were, in a state of\r\nsiege, so incited that beneath the idea of order everyone entertained\r\nthe idea of the scaffold. They saw it, the terrible machine, planted on\r\nall the highways of human life; and the byways as well as the highways\r\nled to it. A sort of martial law, introduced by conquests into civil\r\naffairs, entered thence into ecclesiastical matters,[415] and social\r\neconomy ended by being enslaved by it. As in a camp,[416] expenditure,\r\ndress, the food of each class, are fixed and restricted; no one might\r\nstray out of his district, be idle, live after his own devices. Every\r\nstranger was seized, interrogated; if he could not give a good account\r\nof himself, the parish-stocks bruised his limbs; as in time of war he\r\nwould have passed for a spy and an enemy, if caught amidst the army. Any\r\nperson, says the law,[417] found living idly or loiteringly for the\r\nspace of three days, shall be marked with a hot iron on his breast, and\r\nadjudged as a slave to the man who shall inform against him. This one\r\n\"shall take the same slave, and give him bread, water, or small drink,\r\nand refuse meat, and cause him to work, by beating, chaining, or\r\notherwise, in such work and labour as he shall put him to, be it never\r\nso vile.\" He may sell him, bequeath him, let him out for hire, or trade\r\nupon him \"after the like sort as they may do of any other their moveable\r\ngoods or chattels,\" put a ring of iron about his neck or leg; if he runs\r\naway and absents himself for fourteen days, he is branded on the\r\nforehead with a hot iron, and remains a slave for the whole of his life;\r\nif he runs away a second time, he is put to death. Sometimes, says More,\r\nyou might see a score of thieves hung on the same gibbet. In one\r\nyear[418] forty persons were put to death in the county of Somerset\r\nalone, and in each county there were three or four hundred vagabonds who\r\nwould sometimes gather together and rob in armed bands of sixty at a\r\ntime. Follow the whole of this history closely, the fires of Mary, the\r\npillories of Elizabeth, and it is plain that the moral tone of the land,\r\nlike its physical condition, is harsh by comparison with other\r\ncountries. They have no relish in their enjoyments, as in Italy; what is\r\ncalled Merry England is England given up to animal spirits, a coarse\r\nanimation, produced by abundant feeding, continued prosperity, courage,\r\nand self-reliance; voluptuousness does not exist in this climate and\r\nthis race. Mingled with the beautiful popular beliefs, the lugubrious\r\ndreams and the cruel nightmare of witchcraft make their appearance.\r\nBishop Jewell, preaching before the queen, tells her that witches and\r\nsorcerers within these last few years are marvellously increased. Some\r\nministers assert\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That they have had in their parish at one instant xvij or xviij\r\nwitches; meaning such as could worke miracles supernaturallie; that they\r\nwork spells by which men pine away even unto death, their colour fadeth,\r\ntheir flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed, their senses are bereft;\r\nthat instructed by the devil, they make ointments of the bowels and\r\nmembers of children, whereby they ride in the aire, and accomplish all\r\ntheir desires. When a child is not baptized, or defended by the sign of\r\nthe cross, then the witches catch them from their mothers sides in the\r\nnight,... kill them... or after buriall steale them out of their graves,\r\nand seeth them in a caldron, untill their flesh be made potable.... It\r\nis an infallible rule, that everie fortnight, or at the least everie\r\nmoneth, each witch must kill one child at the least for hir part.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere was something to make the teeth chatter with fright. Add to this\r\nrevolting and absurd descriptions, wretched tomfooleries, details about\r\nthe infernal caldron, all the nastinesses which could haunt the trite\r\nimagination of a hideous and drivelling old woman, and you have the\r\nspectacles, provided by Middleton and Shakespeare, and which suit the\r\nsentiments of the age and the national humor. The fundamental gloom\r\npierces through the glow and rapture of poetry. Mournful legends have\r\nmultiplied; every churchyard has its ghost; wherever a man has been\r\nmurdered his spirit appears. Many people dare not leave their village\r\nafter sunset. In the evening, before bed-time, men talk of the coach\r\nwhich is seen drawn by headless horses, with headless postilions and\r\ncoachmen, or of unhappy spirits who, compelled to inhabit the plain,\r\nunder the sharp northeast wind, pray for the shelter of a hedge or a\r\nvalley. They dream terribly of death:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To die and go we know not where;\r\nTo lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\r\nThis sensible warm motion to become\r\nA kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\r\nTo bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\r\nIn thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;\r\nTo be imprison'd in the viewless winds,\r\nAnd blown with restless violence round about\r\nThe pendent world; or to be worse than worst\r\nOf those that lawless and incertain thought\r\nImagine howling: 'tis too horrible!\"[419]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest speak with a sad resignation of the infinite obscurity\r\nwhich embraces our poor, short, glimmering life, our life, which is but\r\na troubled dream;[420] the sad state of humanity, which is but passion,\r\nmadness, and sorrow; the human being who is himself, perhaps, but a vain\r\nphantom, a grievous sick man's dream. In their eyes we roll down a fatal\r\nslope, where chance dashes us one against the other, and the inner\r\ndestiny which urges us onward, only shatters after it has blinded us.\r\nAnd at the end of all is \"the silent grave, no conversation, no joyful\r\ntread of friends, no voice of lovers, no careful father's counsel;\r\nnothing's heard, nor nothing is, but all oblivion, dust, and endless\r\ndarkness.\"[421] If yet there were nothing. \"To die, to sleep; to sleep,\r\nperchance to dream.\" To dream sadly, to fall into a nightmare like the\r\nnightmare of life, like that in which we are struggling and crying\r\nto-day, gasping with hoarse throat!--this is their idea of man and of\r\nexistence, the national idea, which fills the stage with calamities and\r\ndespair, which makes a display of tortures and massacres, which abounds\r\nin madness and crime, which holds up death as the issue throughout. A\r\nthreatening and sombre fog veils their mind like their sky, and joy,\r\nlike the sun, only appears in its full force now and then. They are\r\ndifferent from the Latin race, and in the common Renaissance they are\r\nregenerated otherwise than the Latin races. The free and full\r\ndevelopment of pure nature which, in Greece and Italy, ends in the\r\npainting of beauty and happy energy, ends here in the painting of\r\nferocious energy, agony, and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--The Poets of the Period\r\n\r\n\r\nThus was this theatre produced; a theatre unique in history, like the\r\nadmirable and fleeting epoch from which it sprang, the work and the\r\npicture of this young world, as natural, as unshackled, and as tragic as\r\nitself. When an original and national drama springs up, the poets who\r\nestablish it carry in themselves the sentiments which it represents.\r\nThey display better than other men the feelings of the public, because\r\nthose feelings arc stronger in them than in other men. The passions\r\nwhich surround them, break forth in their heart with a harsher or a\r\njuster cry, and hence their voices become the voices of all. Chivalric\r\nand Catholic Spain had her interpreters in her enthusiasts and her Don\r\nQuixotes: in Calderon, first a soldier, afterwards a priest; in Lope de\r\nVega, a volunteer at fifteen, a passionate lover, a wandering duelist, a\r\nsoldier of the Armada, finally, a priest and familiar of the Holy\r\nOffice; so full of fervor that he fasts till he is exhausted, faints\r\nwith emotion while singing mass, and in his flagellations stains the\r\nwalls of his cell with blood. Calm and noble Greece had in her principal\r\ntragic poet one of the most accomplished and fortunate of her sons:[422]\r\nSophocles, first in song and palaestra; who at fifteen sang, unclad, the\r\npæan before the trophy of Salamis, and who afterwards, as ambassador,\r\ngeneral, ever loving the gods and impassioned for his state, presented,\r\nin his life as in his works, the spectacle of the incomparable harmony\r\nwhich made the beauty of the ancient world, and which the modern world\r\nwill never more attain to. Eloquent and worldly France, in the age which\r\ncarried the art of good manners and conversation to its highest pitch,\r\nfinds, to write her oratorical tragedies and to paint her drawing-room\r\npassions, the most able craftsman of words, Racine, a courtier, a man of\r\nthe world; the most capable, by the delicacy of his tact and the\r\nadaptation of his style, of making men of the world and courtiers speak.\r\nSo in England the poets are in harmony with their works. Almost all are\r\nBohemians; they sprang from the people,[423] were educated, and usually\r\nstudied at Oxford or Cambridge, but they were poor, so that their\r\neducation contrasts with their condition. Ben Jonson is the step-son of\r\na bricklayer, and himself a bricklayer; Marlowe is the son of a\r\nshoemaker; Shakespeare of a wool merchant; Massinger of a servant of a\r\nnoble family.[424] They live as they can, get into debt, write for their\r\nbread, go on the stage. Peele, Lodge, Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Shakespeare,\r\nHeywood, are actors; most of the details which we have of their lives\r\nare taken from the journal of Henslowe, a retired pawnbroker, later a\r\nmoney-lender and manager of a theatre, who gives them work, advances\r\nmoney to them, receives their manuscripts or their wardrobes as\r\nsecurity. For a play he gives seven or eight pounds; after the year 1600\r\nprices rise, and reach as high as twenty or twenty-five pounds. It is\r\nclear that, even after this increase, the trade of author scarcely\r\nbrings in bread. In order to earn money, it was necessary, like\r\nShakespeare, to become a manager, to try to have a share in the property\r\nof a theatre; but such success is rare, and the life which they lead, a\r\nlife of actors and artists, improvident, full of excess, lost amid\r\ndebauchery and acts of violence, amidst women of evil fame, in contact\r\nwith young profligates, among the temptations of misery, imagination and\r\nlicense, generally leads them to exhaustion, poverty, and death. Men\r\nreceived enjoyment from them, but neglected and despised them. One\r\nactor, for a political allusion, was sent to prison, and only just\r\nescaped losing his ears; great men, men in office, abused them like\r\nservants. Heywood, who played almost every day, bound himself, in\r\naddition, to write a sheet daily, for several years composes at\r\nhaphazard in taverns, labors and sweats like a true literary hack, and\r\ndies leaving two hundred and twenty pieces, of which most are lost. Kyd,\r\none of the earliest in date, died in misery. Shirley, one of the last,\r\nat the end of his career, was obliged to become once more a\r\nschoolmaster. Massinger dies unknown; and in the parish register we find\r\nonly this sad mention of him: \"Philip Massinger, a stranger.\" A few\r\nmonths after the death of Middleton, his widow was obliged to ask alms\r\nof the City, because he had left nothing. Imagination, as Drummond said\r\nof Ben Jonson, oppressed their reason; it is the common failing of\r\npoets. They wish to enjoy, and give themselves wholly up to enjoyment;\r\ntheir mood, their heart governs them; in their life, as in their works,\r\nimpulses are irresistible; desire comes suddenly, like a wave, drowning\r\nreason, resistance--often even giving neither reason nor resistance time\r\nto show themselves.[425] Many are roisterers, sad roisterers of the same\r\nsort, such as Musset and Murger, who give themselves up to every\r\npassion, and \"drown their sorrows in the bowl\"; capable of the purest\r\nand most poetic dreams, of the most delicate and touching tenderness,\r\nand who yet can only undermine their health and mar their fame. Such\r\nare Nash, Decker, and Greene; Nash, a fantastic satirist, who abused his\r\ntalent, and conspired like a prodigal against good fortune; Decker, who\r\npassed three years in the King's Bench prison; Greene, above all, a\r\npleasing wit, copious, graceful, who took a delight in destroying\r\nhimself, publicly with tears confessing his vices,[426] and the next\r\nmoment plunging into them again. These are mere androgynes, true\r\ncourtesans, in manners, body, and heart. Quitting Cambridge, \"with good\r\nfellows as free-living as himself,\" Greene had travelled over Spain,\r\nItaly, \"in which places he sawe and practizde such villainie as is\r\nabhominable to declare.\" You see the poor man is candid, not sparing\r\nhimself; he is natural; passionate in everything, repentance or\r\notherwise; above all of ever-varying mood; made for self-contradiction;\r\nnot self-correction. On his return he became, in London, a supporter of\r\ntaverns, a haunter of evil places. In his \"Groatsworth of Wit bought\r\nwith a Million of Repentance\" he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was dround in pride, whoredom was my daily exercise, and gluttony\r\nwith drunkenness was my onely delight.... After I had wholly betaken me\r\nto the penning of plaies (which was my continuall exercise) I was so far\r\nfrom calling upon God that I sildome thought on God, but tooke such\r\ndelight in swearing and blaspheming the name of God that none could\r\nthinke otherwise of me than that I was the child of perdition. These\r\nvanities and other trifling pamphlets I penned of love and vaine\r\nfantasies was my chiefest stay of living; and for those my vaine\r\ndiscourses I was beloved of the more vainer sort of people, who being my\r\ncontinuall companions, came still to my lodging, and there would\r\ncontinue quaffing, carowsing, and surfeting with me all the day long....\r\nIf I may have my disire while I live I am satisfied; let me shift after\r\ndeath as I may.... 'Hell!' quoth I; 'what talke you of hell to me? I\r\nknow if I once come there I shall have the company of better men than\r\nmyselfe; I shall also meete with some madde knaves in that place, and so\r\nlong as I shall not sit there alone, my care is the lesse.... If I\r\nfeared the judges of the bench no more than I dread the judgments of God\r\nI would before I slept dive into one carles bagges or other, and make\r\nmerrie with the shelles I found in them so long as they would last.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later he is seized with remorse, marries, depicts in delicious\r\nverse the regularity and calm of an upright life; then returns to\r\nLondon, spends his property and his wife's fortune with \"a sorry ragged\r\nqueane,\" in the company of ruffians, pimps, sharpers, courtesans;\r\ndrinking, blaspheming, wearing himself out by sleepless nights and\r\norgies; writing for bread, sometimes amid the brawling and effluvia of\r\nhis wretched lodging, lighting upon thoughts of adoration and love,\r\nworthy of Rolla;[427] very often disgusted with himself, seized with a\r\nfit of weeping between two merry bouts, and writing little pieces to\r\naccuse himself, to regret his wife, to convert his comrades, or to warn\r\nyoung people against the tricks of prostitutes and swindlers. He was\r\nsoon worn out by this kind of life; six years were enough to exhaust\r\nhim. An indigestion arising from Rhenish wine and pickled herrings\r\nfinished him. If it had not been for his landlady, who succored him, he\r\n\"would have perished in the streets.\" He lasted a little longer, and\r\nthen his light went out; now and then he begged her \"pittifully for a\r\npenny pott of malmesie\"; he was covered with lice, he had but one shirt,\r\nand when his own was \"awashing,\" he was obliged to borrow her husband's.\r\n\"His doublet and hose and sword were sold for three shillinges,\" and the\r\npoor folks paid the cost of his burial, four shillings for the winding\r\nsheet, and six and fourpence for the burial.\r\n\r\nIn such low places, on such dunghills, amid such excesses and violence,\r\ndramatic genius forced its way, and amongst others, that of the first,\r\nof the most powerful, of the true founder of the dramatic school,\r\nChristopher Marlowe.\r\n\r\nMarlowe was an ill-regulated, dissolute, outrageously vehement and\r\naudacious spirit, but grand and sombre, with the genuine poetic frenzy;\r\npagan moreover, and rebellious in manners and creed. In this universal\r\nreturn to the senses, and in this impulse of natural forces which\r\nbrought on the Renaissance, the corporeal instincts and the ideas which\r\nhallow them, break forth impetuously. Marlowe, like Greene, like\r\nKett,[428] is a sceptic, denies God and Christ, blasphemes the Trinity,\r\ndeclares Moses \"a juggler,\" Christ more worthy of death than Barabas,\r\nsays that \"yf he wer to write a new religion, he wolde undertake both a\r\nmore excellent and more admirable methode,\" and \"almost in every company\r\nhe commeth, perswadeth men to Athiesme.\"[429] Such were the rages, the\r\nrashnesses, the excesses which liberty of thought gave rise to in these\r\nnew minds, who for the first time, after so many centuries, dared to\r\nwalk unfettered. From his father's shop, crowded with children, from the\r\nstraps and awls, he found himself studying at Cambridge, probably\r\nthrough the patronage of a great man, and on his return to London, in\r\nwant, amid the license of the green-room, the low houses and taverns,\r\nhis head was in a ferment, and his passions became excited. He turned\r\nactor; but having broken his leg in a scene of debauchery, he remained\r\nlame, and could no longer appear on the boards. He openly avowed his\r\ninfidelity, and a prosecution was begun, which, if time had not failed,\r\nwould probably have brought him to the stake. He made love to a drab,\r\nand in trying to stab his rival, his hand was turned, so that his own\r\nblade entered his eye and his brain, and he died, cursing and\r\nblaspheming. He was only thirty years old.\r\n\r\nThink what poetry could emanate from a life so passionate, and occupied\r\nin such a manner! First, exaggerated declamation, heaps of murder,\r\natrocities, a pompous and furious display of tragedy bespattered with\r\nblood, and passions raised to a pitch of madness. All the foundations of\r\nthe English stage, \"Ferrex and Porrex, Cambyses, Hieronymo,\" even\r\nthe \"Pericles\" of Shakespeare, reach the same height of extravagance,\r\nmagniloquence and horror.[430] It is the first outbreak of youth. Recall\r\nSchiller's \"Robbers,\" and how modern democracy has recognized for the\r\nfirst time its picture in the metaphors and cries of Charles Moor.[431]\r\nSo here the characters struggle and roar, stamp on the earth, gnash\r\ntheir teeth, shake their fists against heaven. The trumpets sound, the\r\ndrums beat, coats of mail file past armies clash, men stab each other,\r\nor themselves; speeches are full of gigantic threats and lyrical\r\nfigures;[432] kings die, straining a bass voice; \"now doth ghastly death\r\nwith greedy talons gripe my bleeding heart, and like a harpy tires on my\r\nlife.\" The hero in \"Tamburlaine the Great\"[433] is seated on a chariot\r\ndrawn by chained kings; he burns towns, drowns women and children, puts\r\nmen to the sword, and finally, seized with an inscrutable sickness,\r\nraves in monstrous outcries against the gods, whose hands afflict his\r\nsoul, and whom he would fain dethrone. There already is the picture of\r\nsenseless pride, of blind and murderous rage, which passing through many\r\ndevastations, at last arms against heaven itself. The overflowing of\r\nsavage and immoderate instinct produces this mighty sounding verse, this\r\nprodigality of carnage, this display of splendors and exaggerated\r\ncolors, this railing of demoniacal passions, this audacity of grand\r\nimpiety. If in the dramas which succeed it, \"The Massacre at Paris,\"\r\n\"The Jew of Malta,\" the bombast decreases, the violence remains. Barabas\r\nthe Jew maddened with hate, is henceforth no longer human; he has been\r\ntreated by the Christians like a beast, and he hates them like a beast.\r\nHe advises his servant Ithamore in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,\r\nAnd I will teach thee that shall stick by thee:\r\nFirst, be thou void of these affections,\r\nCompassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;\r\nBe mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,\r\nBut to thyself smile when the Christians moan.\r\n... I walk abroad a-nights,\r\nAnd kill sick people groaning under walls;\r\nSometimes I go about and poison wells....\r\nBeing young, I studied physic, and began\r\nTo practice first upon the Italian;\r\nThere I enrich'd the priests with burials,\r\nAnd always kept the sexton's arms in ure\r\nWith digging graves and ringing dead men's knells....\r\nI fill'd the jails with bankrouts in a year,\r\nAnd with young orphans planted hospitals;\r\nAnd every moon made some or other mad,\r\nAnd now and then one hang himself for grief,\r\nPinning upon his breast a long great scroll\r\nHow I with interest tormented him.\"[434]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these cruelties he boasts of and chuckles over, like a demon who\r\nrejoices in being a good executioner, and plunges his victims in the\r\nvery extremity of anguish. His daughter has two Christian suitors; and\r\nby forged letters he causes them to slay each other. In despair she\r\ntakes the veil, and to avenge himself he poisons his daughter and the\r\nwhole convent. Two friars wish to denounce him, then to convert him; he\r\nstrangles the first, and jokes with his slave Ithamore, a cut-throat by\r\nprofession, who loves his trade, rubs his hands with joy, and says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pull amain,\r\n'Tis neatly done, sir; here's no print at all.\r\nSo, let him lean upon his staff; excellent! he stands as if he were\r\nbegging of bacon.\"[435]\r\n\"O mistress, I have the bravest, gravest, secret, subtle, bottlenosed\r\nknave to my master, that ever gentleman had.\"[436]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second friar comes up, and they accuse him of the murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Barabas._ Heaven bless me! what, a friar a murderer!\r\nWhen shall you see a Jew commit the like?\r\n_Ithamore._ Why, a Turk could ha' done no more.\r\n_Bar._ To-morrow is the sessions; you shall do it--\r\nCome Ithamore, let's help to take him hence.\r\n_Friar._ Villains, I am a sacred person; touch me not.\r\n_Bar._ The law shall touch you; we'll but lead you, we:\r\n'Las, I could weep at your calamity!\"[437]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have also two other poisonings, an infernal machine to blow up the\r\nTurkish garrison, a plot to cast the Turkish commander into a well.\r\nBarabas falls into it himself, and dies in the hot caldron,[438]\r\nhowling, hardened, remorseless, having but one regret, that he had not\r\ndone evil enough. These are the ferocities of the Middle Ages; we might\r\nfind them to this day among the companions of Ali Pacha, among the\r\npirates of the Archipelago; we retain pictures of them in the paintings\r\nof the fifteenth century, which represent a king with his court, seated\r\ncalmly round a living man who is being flayed; in the midst the flayer\r\non his knees is working conscientiously, very careful not to spoil the\r\nskin.[439]\r\n\r\nAll this is pretty strong, you will say; these people kill too readily,\r\nand too quickly. It is on this very account that the painting is a true\r\none. For the specialty of the men of the time, as of Marlowe's\r\ncharacters, is the abrupt commission of a deed; they are children,\r\nrobust children. As a horse kicks out instead of speaking, so they pull\r\nout their knives instead of asking an explanation. Nowadays we hardly\r\nknow what nature is; instead of observing it we still retain the\r\nbenevolent prejudices of the eighteenth century; we only see it\r\nhumanized by two centuries of culture, and we take its acquired calm for\r\nan innate moderation. The foundations of the natural man are\r\nirresistible impulses, passions, desires, greeds; all blind. He sees a\r\nwoman,[440] thinks her beautiful; suddenly he rushes towards her; people\r\ntry to restrain him, he kills these people, gluts his passion, then\r\nthinks no more of it, save when at times a vague picture of a moving\r\nlake of blood crosses his brain and makes him gloomy. Sudden and extreme\r\nresolves are confused in his mind with desire; barely planned, the thing\r\nis done; the wide interval which a Frenchman places between the idea of\r\nan action and the action itself is not to be found here.[441] Barabas\r\nconceived murders, and straightway murders were accomplished; there is\r\nno deliberation, no pricks of conscience; that is how he commits a score\r\nof them; his daughter leaves him, he becomes unnatural, and poisons her;\r\nhis confidential servant betrays him, he disguises himself, and poisons\r\nhim. Rage seizes these men like a fit, and then they are forced to kill.\r\nBenvenuto Cellini relates how, being offended, he tried to restrain\r\nhimself, but was nearly suffocated; and that in order to cure himself,\r\nhe rushed with his dagger upon his opponent. So, in \"Edward the Second,\"\r\nthe nobles immediately appeal to arms; all is excessive and unforeseen:\r\nbetween two replies the heart is turned upside down, transported to the\r\nextremes of hate or tenderness. Edward, seeing his favorite Gaveston\r\nagain, pours out before him his treasure, casts his dignities at his\r\nfeet, gives him his seal, himself, and, on a threat from the Bishop of\r\nCoventry, suddenly cries:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,\r\nAnd in the channel christen him anew.\"[442]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, when the queen supplicates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fawn not on me, French strumpet! get thee gone....\r\nSpeak not unto her: let her droop and pine.\"[443]\r\n\r\n\r\nFuries and hatreds clash together like horsemen in battle. The Earl of\r\nLancaster draws his sword on Gaveston to slay him, before the king;\r\nMortimer wounds Gaveston. These powerful loud voices growl; the noblemen\r\nwill not even let a dog approach the prince, and rob them of their rank.\r\nLancaster says of Gaveston:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... He comes not back,\r\nUnless the sea cast up his shipwrack'd body.\r\n_Warwick._ And to behold so sweet a sight as that,\r\nThere's none here but would run his horse to death.\"[444]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have seized Gaveston, and intend to hang him \"at a bough\"; they\r\nrefuse to let him speak a single minute with the king. In vain they are\r\nentreated; when they do at last consent, they are sorry for it; it is a\r\nprey they want immediately, and Warwick, seizing him by force, \"strake\r\noff his head in a trench.\" Those are the men of the Middle Ages. They\r\nhave the fierceness, the tenacity, the pride of big, well-fed,\r\nthorough-bred bull-dogs. It is this sternness and impetuosity of\r\nprimitive passions which produced the Wars of the Roses, and for thirty\r\nyears drove the nobles on each other's swords and to the block.\r\n\r\nWhat is there beyond all these frenzies and gluttings of blood? The idea\r\nof crushing necessity and inevitable ruin in which everything sinks and\r\ncomes to an end. Mortimer, brought to the block, says with a smile:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel\r\nThere is a point, to which, when men aspire,\r\nThey tumble headlong down: that point I touch'd,\r\nAnd, seeing there was no place to mount up higher,\r\nWhy should I grieve at my declining fall?--\r\nFarewell, fair queen; weep not for Mortimer,\r\nThat scorns the world, and, as a traveller,\r\nGoes to discover countries yet unknown.\"[445]\r\n\r\n\r\nWeigh well these grand words; they are a cry from the heart, the\r\nprofound confession of Marlowe, as also of Byron, and of the old\r\nsea-kings. The northern paganism is fully expressed in this heroic and\r\nmournful sigh: it is thus they imagine the world so long as they remain\r\non the outside of Christianity, or as soon as they quit it. Thus, when\r\nmen see in life, as they did, nothing but a battle of unchecked\r\npassions, and in death but a gloomy sleep, perhaps filled with mournful\r\ndreams, there is no other supreme good but a day of enjoyment and\r\nvictory. They glut themselves, shutting their eyes to the issue, except\r\nthat they may be swallowed up on the morrow. That is the master-thought\r\nof \"Doctor Faustus,\" the greatest of Marlowe's dramas: to satisfy his\r\nsoul, no matter at what price, or with what results:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A sound magician is a mighty god....\r\nHow am I glutted with conceit of this!...\r\nI'll have them fly to India for gold,\r\nRansack the ocean for orient pearl....\r\nI'll have them read me strange philosophy,\r\nAnd tell the secrets of all foreign kings;\r\nI'll have them wall all Germany with brass,\r\nAnd make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg....\r\nLike lions shall they guard us when we please;\r\nLike Almain rutters with their horsemen's staves,\r\nOr Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;\r\nSometimes like women, or unwedded maids,\r\nShadowing more beauty in their airy brows\r\nThan have the white breasts of the queen of love.\"[446]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat brilliant dreams, what desires, what vast or voluptuous wishes,\r\nworthy of a Roman Cæsar or an Eastern poet, eddy in this teeming brain!\r\nTo satiate them, to obtain four-and-twenty years of power, Faustus gave\r\nhis soul, without fear, without need of temptation, at the first outset,\r\nvoluntarily, so sharp is the prick within:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Had I as many souls as there be stars,\r\nI'd give them all for Mephistophilis.\r\nBy him I'll be great emperor of the world,\r\nAnd make a bridge thorough the moving air....\r\nWhy shouldst thou not? Is not thy soul thine own?\"[447]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with that he gives himself full swing: he wants to know everything,\r\nto have everything; a book in which he can behold all herbs and trees\r\nwhich grow upon the earth; another in which shall be drawn all the\r\nconstellations and planets; another which shall bring him gold when he\r\nwills it, and \"the fairest courtezans\"; another which summons \"men in\r\narmour\" ready to execute his commands, and which holds \"whirlwinds,\r\ntempests, thunder and lightning\" chained at his disposal. He is like a\r\nchild, he stretches out his hands for everything shining; then grieves\r\nto think of hell, then lets himself be diverted by shows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Faustus._ O this feeds my soul!\r\n_Lucifer._ Tut, Faustus, in hell is all manner of delight.\r\n_Faustus._ Oh, might I see hell, and return again,\r\nHow happy were I then!...\"[448]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is conducted, being invisible, over the whole world: lastly to Rome,\r\namongst the ceremonies of the pope's court. Like a schoolboy during a\r\nholiday, he has insatiable eyes, he forgets everything before a pageant,\r\nhe amuses himself in playing tricks, in giving the pope a box on the\r\near, in beating the monks, in performing magic tricks before princes,\r\nfinally in drinking, feasting, filling his belly, deadening his\r\nthoughts. In his transport he becomes an atheist, and says there is no\r\nhell, that those are \"old wives' tales.\" Then suddenly the sad idea\r\nknocks at the gates of his brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will renounce this magic, and repent...\r\nMy heart's so harden'd I cannot repent:\r\nScarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,\r\nBut fearful echoes thunder in mine ears,\r\n'Faustus, thou are damn'd!' then swords and knives,\r\nPoison, guns, halters, and envenom'd steel\r\nAre laid before me to despatch myself;\r\nAnd long ere this I should have done the deed,\r\nHad not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.\r\nHave not I made blind Homer sing to me\r\nOf Alexander's love and Œnon's death?\r\nAnd hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes\r\nWith ravishing sound of his melodious harp,\r\nMade music with my Mephistophilis?\r\nWhy should I die, then, or basely despair?\r\nI am resolv'd; Faustus shall ne'er repent.--\r\nCome Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,\r\nAnd argue of divine astrology.\r\nTell me, are there many heavens above the moon?\r\nAre all celestial bodies but one globe,\r\nAs is the substance of this centric earth?...\"[449]\r\n\"One thing... let me crave of thee\r\nTo glut the longing of my heart's desire....\r\nWas this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,\r\nAnd burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\r\nSweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!\r\nHer lips suck forth my soul: see, where it flies!--\r\nCome, Helen, come, give me my soul again.\r\nHere will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,\r\nAnd all is dross that is not Helena....\r\nO thou art fairer than the evening air\r\nClad in the beauty of a thousand stars!\"[450]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God, I would weep! but the devil draws in my tears. Gush forth\r\nblood, instead of tears! yea, life and soul! Oh, he stays my tongue! I\r\nwould lift up my hands; but see, they hold them, they hold them; Lucifer\r\nand Mephistophilis....\"[451]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Faustus,\r\nNow hast thou but one bare hour to live,\r\nAnd then thou must be damn'd perpetually!\r\nStand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,\r\nThat time may cease, and midnight never come....\r\nThe stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,\r\nThe devil will come, and Faustus must be damn'd.\r\nOh, I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?--\r\nSee, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament!\r\nOne drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ,\r\nAh, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ,\r\nYet will I call on him....\r\nAh, half the hour is past! 'twill all be past anon....\r\nLet Faustus live in hell a thousand years,\r\nA hundred thousand, and at last be sav'd....\r\nIt strikes, it strikes....\r\nOh soul, be chang'd into little water-drops,\r\nAnd fall into the ocean, ne'er be found!\"[452]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is the living, struggling, natural, personal man, not the\r\nphilosophic type which Goethe has created, but a primitive and genuine\r\nman, hot-headed, fiery, the slave of his passions, the sport of his\r\ndreams, wholly engrossed in the present, moulded by his lusts,\r\ncontradictions, and follies, who amidst noise and starts, cries of\r\npleasure and anguish, rolls, knowing it and willing it, down the slope\r\nand crags of his precipice. The whole English drama is here, as a plant\r\nin its seed, and Marlowe is to Shakespeare what Perugino was to Raphael.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--Formation of the Drama\r\n\r\n\r\nGradually art is being formed; and toward the close of the century it is\r\ncomplete. Shakespeare, Beaumont, Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Webster,\r\nMassinger, Ford, Middleton, Heywood, appear together, or close upon each\r\nother, a new and favored generation, flourishing largely in the soil\r\nfertilized by the efforts of the generation which preceded them.\r\nHenceforth the scenes are developed and assume consistency, the\r\ncharacters cease to move all of a piece, the drama is no longer like a\r\npiece of statuary. The poet who a little while ago knew only how to\r\nstrike or kill, introduces now a sequence of situation and a rationale\r\nin intrigue. He begins to prepare the way for sentiments, to forewarn us\r\nof events, to combine effects, and we find a theatre at last, the most\r\ncomplete, the most life-like, and also the most strange that ever\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nWe must follow its formation, and regard the drama when it was formed,\r\nthat is, in the minds of its authors. What was going on in these minds?\r\nWhat sorts of ideas were born there, and how were they born? In the\r\nfirst place, they see the event, whatever it be, and they see it as it\r\nis; I mean that they have it within themselves, with its persons and\r\ndetails, beautiful and ugly, even dull and grotesque. If it is a trial,\r\nthe judge is there, in their minds, in his place, with his physiognomy\r\nand his warts; the plaintiff in another place, with his spectacles and\r\nbrief-bag; the accused is opposite, stooping and remorseful; each with\r\nhis friends, cobblers, or lords; then the buzzing crowd behind, all with\r\ntheir grinning faces, their bewildered or kindling eyes.[453] It is a\r\ngenuine trial which they imagine, a trial like those they have seen\r\nbefore the justice, where they screamed or shouted as witnesses or\r\ninterested parties, with their quibbling terms, their pros and cons, the\r\nscribblings, the sharp voices of the counsel, the stamping of feet, the\r\ncrowding, the smell of their fellow-men, and so forth. The endless\r\nmyriads of circumstances which accompany and influence every event,\r\ncrowd round that event in their heads, and not merely the externals,\r\nthat is, the visible and picturesque traits, the details of color and\r\ncostume, but also, and chiefly, the internals, that is, the motions of\r\nanger and joy, the secret tumult of the soul, the ebb and flow of ideas\r\nand passions which are expressed by the countenance, swell the veins,\r\nmake a man to grind his teeth, to clench his fists, which urge him on or\r\nrestrain him. They see all the details, the tides that sway a man, one\r\nfrom without, another from within, one through another, one within\r\nanother, both together without faltering and without ceasing. And what\r\nis this insight but sympathy, an imitative sympathy, which puts us in\r\nanother's place, which carries over their agitations to our own breasts,\r\nwhich makes our life a little world, able to reproduce the great one in\r\nabstract? Like the characters they imagine, poets and spectators make\r\ngestures, raise their voices, act. No speech or story can show their\r\ninner mood, but it is the scenic effect which can manifest it. As some\r\nmen invent a language for their ideas, so these act and mimic them;\r\ntheatrical imitation and figured representation is their genuine speech:\r\nall other expression, the lyrical song of Æschylus, the reflective\r\nsymbolism of Goethe, the oratorical development of Racine, would be\r\nimpossible for them. Involuntarily, instantaneously, without forecast,\r\nthey cut life into scenes, and carry it piecemeal on the boards; this\r\ngoes so far that often a mere character becomes an actor,[454] playing a\r\npart within a part; the scenic faculty is the natural form of their\r\nmind. Beneath the effort of this instinct, all the accessory parts of\r\nthe drama come before the footlights and expand before your eyes. A\r\nbattle has been fought; instead of relating it, they bring it before the\r\npublic, trumpets and drums, pushing crowds, slaughtering combatants. A\r\nshipwreck happens; straightway the ship is before the spectator, with\r\nthe sailors' oaths, the technical orders of the pilot. Of all the\r\ndetails of human life,[455] tavern-racket and statesmen's councils,\r\nscullion's talk and court processions, domestic tenderness and\r\npandering--none is to small or too lofty: these things exist in\r\nlife--let them exist on the stage, each in full, in the rough,\r\natrocious, or absurd, just as they are, no matter how. Neither in\r\nGreece, nor Italy, nor Spain, nor France, has an art been seen which\r\ntried so boldly to express the soul, and its innermost depths—the\r\ntruth, and the whole truth.\r\n\r\nHow did they succeed, and what is this new art which tramples on all\r\nordinary rules? It is an art for all that, since it is natural; a great\r\nart, since it embraces more things, and that more deeply than others do,\r\nlike the art of Rembrandt and Rubens; but like theirs, it is a Teutonic\r\nart, and one whose every step is in contrast with those of classical\r\nart. What the Greeks and Romans, the originators of the latter, sought\r\nin everything, was charm and order. Monuments, statues, and paintings,\r\nthe theatre, eloquence and poetry, from Sophocles to Racine, they shaped\r\nall their work in the same mould, and attained beauty by the same\r\nmethod. In the infinite entanglement and complexity of things, they\r\ngrasped a small number of simple ideas, which they embraced in a small\r\nnumber of simple representations, so that the vast confused vegetation\r\nof life is presented to the mind from that time forth, pruned and\r\nreduced, and perhaps easily embraced at a single glance. A square of\r\nwalls with rows of columns all alike; a symmetrical group of draped or\r\nundraped forms; a young man standing up and raising one arm; a wounded\r\nwarrior who will not return to the camp, though they beseech him: this,\r\nin their noblest epoch, was their architecture, their painting, their\r\nsculpture, and their theatre. No poetry but a few sentiments not very\r\nintricate, always natural, not toned down, intelligible to all; no\r\neloquence but a continuous argument, a limited vocabulary, the loftiest\r\nideas brought down to their sensible origin, so that children can\r\nunderstand such eloquence and feel such poetry; and in this sense they\r\nare classical.[456] In the hands of Frenchmen, the last inheritors of\r\nthe simple art, these great legacies of antiquity undergo no change. If\r\npoetic genius is less, the structure of mind has not altered. Racine\r\nputs on the stage a sole action, whose details he adjusts, and whose\r\ncourse he regulates; no incident, nothing unforeseen, no appendices or\r\nincongruities; no secondary intrigue. The subordinate parts are effaced;\r\nat the most four or five principal characters, the fewest possible; the\r\nrest, reduced to the condition of confidants, take the tone of their\r\nmasters, and merely reply to them. All the scenes are connected, and\r\nflow insensibly one into the other, and every scene, like the entire\r\npiece, has its order and progress. The tragedy stands out symmetrically\r\nand clear in the midst of human life, like a complete and solitary\r\ntemple which limns its regular outline on the luminous azure of the sky,\r\nin England all is different. All that the French call proportion and\r\nfitness is wanting; Englishmen do not trouble themselves about them,\r\nthey do not need them. There is no unity; they leap suddenly over twenty\r\nyears, or five hundred leagues. There are twenty scenes in an act--we\r\nstumble without preparation from one to the other, from tragedy to\r\nbuffoonery; usually it appears as though the action gained no ground;\r\nthe different personages waste their time in conversation, dreaming,\r\ndisplaying their character. We were moved, anxious for the issue, and\r\nhere they bring us in quarrelling servants, lovers making poetry. Even\r\nthe dialogue and speeches, which we would think ought particularly to be\r\nof a regular and continuous flow of engrossing ideas, remain stagnant,\r\nor are scattered in windings and deviations. At first sight we fancy we\r\nare not advancing, we do not feel at every phrase that we have made a\r\nstep. There are none of those solid pleadings, none of those conclusive\r\ndiscussions, which every moment add reason to reason, objection to\r\nobjection; people might say that the different personages only knew how\r\nto scold, to repeat themselves, and to mark time. And the disorder is as\r\ngreat in general as in particular things. They heap a whole reign, a\r\ncomplete war, an entire novel, into a drama; they cut up into scenes an\r\nEnglish chronicle or an Italian novel: this is all their art; the events\r\nmatter little; whatever they are, they accept them. They have no idea of\r\nprogressive and individual action. Two or three actions connected\r\nendwise, or entangled one within another, two or three incomplete\r\nendings badly contrived, and opened up again; no machinery but death,\r\nscattered right and left and unforeseen: such is the logic of their\r\nmethod. The fact is, that our logic, the Latin, fails them. Their mind\r\ndoes not march by the smooth and straightforward paths of rhetoric and\r\neloquence. It reaches the same end, but by other approaches. It is at\r\nonce more comprehensive and less regular than ours. It demands a\r\nconception more complete, but less consecutive. It proceeds, not as with\r\nus, by a line of uniform steps, but by sudden leaps and long pauses. It\r\ndoes not rest satisfied with a simple idea drawn from a complex fact,\r\nbut demands the complex fact entire, with its numberless\r\nparticularities, its interminable ramifications. It sees in man not a\r\ngeneral passion--ambition, anger, or love; not a pure\r\nquality--happiness, avarice, folly; but a character, that is, the\r\nimprint, wonderfully complicated, which inheritance, temperament,\r\neducation, calling, age, society, conversation, habits, have stamped on\r\nevery man; an incommunicable and individual imprint, which, once stamped\r\nin a man, is not found again in any other. It sees in the hero not only\r\nthe hero, but the individual, with his manner of walking, drinking,\r\nswearing, blowing his nose; with the tone of his voice, whether he is\r\nthin or fat;[457] and thus plunges to the bottom of things, with every\r\nlook, as by a miner's deep shaft. This sunk, it little cares whether the\r\nsecond shaft be two paces or a hundred from the first; enough that it\r\nreaches the same depth, and serves equally well to display the inner and\r\nvisible layer. Logic is here from beneath, not from above. It is the\r\nunity of a character which binds the two actions of the personage, as\r\nthe unity of an impression connects the two scenes of a drama. To speak\r\nexactly, the spectator is like a man whom we should lead along a wall\r\npierced at separate intervals with little windows; at every window he\r\ncatches for an instant a glimpse of a new landscape, with its million\r\ndetails: the walk over, if he is of Latin race and training, he finds a\r\nmedley of images jostling in his head, and asks for a map that he may\r\nrecollect himself; if he is of German race and training, he perceives as\r\na whole, by natural concentration, the wide country which he has only\r\nseen piecemeal. Such a conception, by the multitude of details which it\r\ncombines, and by the depth of the vistas which it embraces, is a\r\nhalf-vision which shakes the whole soul. What its works are about to\r\nshow us is, with what energy, what disdain of contrivance, what\r\nvehemence of truth, it dares to coin and hammer the human medal; with\r\nwhat liberty it is able to reproduce in full prominence worn-out\r\ncharacters, and the extreme flights of virgin nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--Furious Passions--Exaggerated Characters\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us consider the different personages which this art, so suited to\r\ndepict real manners, and so apt to paint the living soul, goes in search\r\nof amidst the real manners and the living souls of its time and country.\r\nThey are of two kinds, as befits the nature of the drama: one which\r\nproduces terror, the other which moves to pity; these graceful and\r\nfeminine, those manly and violent. All the differences of sex, all the\r\nextremes of life, all the resources of the stage, are embraced in this\r\ncontrast; and if ever there was a complete contrast, it is here.\r\n\r\nThe reader must study for himself some of these pieces, or he will have\r\nno idea of the fury into which the stage is hurled: force and transport\r\nare driven every instant to the point of atrocity, and further still, if\r\nthere be any further. Assassinations, poisonings, tortures, outcries of\r\nmadness and rage; no passion and no suffering are too extreme for their\r\nenergy or their effort. Anger is with them a madness, ambition a frenzy,\r\nlove a delirium. Hippolyto, who has lost his mistress, says, \"Were thine\r\neyes clear as mine, thou mightst behold her, watching upon yon\r\nbattlements of stars, how I observe them.\"[458] Aretus, to be avenged on\r\nValentinian, poisons him after poisoning himself, and with the\r\ndeath-rattle in his throat, is brought to his enemy's side, to give him\r\na foretaste of agony. Queen Brunhalt has panders with her on the stage,\r\nand causes her two sons to slay each other. Death everywhere; at the\r\nclose of every play, all the great people wade in blood: with slaughter\r\nand butcheries, the stage becomes a field of battle or a\r\nchurchyard.[459] Shall I describe a few of these tragedies? In the \"Duke\r\nof Milan,\" Francesco, to avenge his sister, who has been seduced, wishes\r\nto seduce in his turn the Duchess Marcelia, wife of Sforza, the seducer;\r\nhe desires her, he will have her; he says to her, with cries of love and\r\nrage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For with this arm I'll swim through seas of blood,\r\nOr make a bridge, arch'd with the bones of men,\r\nBut I will grasp my aims in you, my dearest,\r\nDearest, and best of women!\"[460]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor he wishes to strike the duke through her, whether she lives or dies,\r\nif not by dishonor, at least by murder; the first is as good as the\r\nsecond, nay, better, for so he will do a greater injury. He calumniates\r\nher, and the duke, who adores her, kills her; then, being undeceived,\r\nloses his senses, will not believe she is dead, has the body brought in,\r\nkneels before it, rages and weeps. He knows now the name of the traitor,\r\nand at the thought of him he swoons or raves:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll follow him to hell, but I will find him,\r\nAnd there live a fourth Fury to torment him.\r\nThen, for this cursed hand and arm that guided\r\nThe wicked steel, I'll have them, joint by joint,\r\nWith burning irons sear'd off, which I will eat,\r\nI being a vulture fit to taste such carrion.\"[461]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly he gasps for breath, and falls; Francesco has poisoned him. The\r\nduke dies, and the murderer is led to torture. There are worse scenes\r\nthan this; to find sentiments strong enough, they go to those which\r\nchange the very nature of man. Massinger puts on the stage a father who\r\njudges and condemns his daughter, stabbed by her husband; Webster and\r\nFord, a son who assassinates his mother; Ford, the incestuous loves of a\r\nbrother and sister.[462] Irresistible love overtakes them; the ancient\r\nlove of Pasiphaë and Myrrha, a kind of madness-like enchantment, and\r\nbeneath which the will entirely gives way. Giovanni says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lost! I am lost! My fates have doom'd my death!\r\nThe more I strive, I love; the more I love,\r\nThe less I hope: I see my ruin certain....\r\nI have even wearied heaven with pray'rs, dried up\r\nThe spring of my continual tears, even starv'd\r\nMy veins with daily fasts: what wit or art\r\nCould counsel, I have practis'd; but, alas!\r\nI find all these but dreams, and old men's tales,\r\nTo fright unsteady youth: I am still the same;\r\nOr I must speak, or burst.\"[463]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat transports follow! what fierce and bitter joys, and how short too,\r\nhow grievous and mingled with anguish, especially for her! She is\r\nmarried to another. Read for yourself the admirable and horrible scene\r\nwhich represents the wedding night. She is pregnant, and Soranzo, the\r\nhusband, drags her along the ground, with curses, demanding the name of\r\nher lover:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come strumpet, famous whore?...\r\nHarlot, rare, notable harlot,\r\nThat with thy brazen face maintain'st thy sin,\r\nWas there no man in Parma to be bawd\r\nTo your loose cunning whoredom else but I?\r\nMust your hot itch and plurisy of lust,\r\nThe heyday of your luxury, be fed\r\nUp to a surfeit, and could none but I\r\nBe pick'd out to be cloak to your close tricks,\r\nYour belly-sports?--Now I must be the dad\r\nTo all that gallimaufry that is stuff'd\r\nIn thy corrupted bastard-bearing womb?\r\nSay, must I?\r\n_Annabella._ Beastly man? why, 'tis thy fate.\r\nI su'd not to thee....\r\n_S._ Tell me by whom.\"[464]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe gets excited, feels and cares for nothing more, refuses to tell the\r\nname of her lover, and praises him in the following words. This praise\r\nin the midst of danger is like a rose she has plucked, and of which the\r\nodor intoxicates her:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_A._ Soft! 'twas not in my bargain.\r\nYet somewhat, sir, to stay your longing stomach\r\nI am content t' acquaint you with _the_ man,\r\nThe more than man, that got this sprightly boy--\r\n(For 'tis a boy, and therefore glory, sir,\r\nYour heir shall be a son.)\r\n_S._ Damnable monster?\r\n_A._ Nay, and you will not hear, I'll speak no more.\r\n_S._ Yes, speak, and speak thy last.\r\n_A._ A match, a match?...\r\nYou, why you are not worthy once to name\r\nHis name without true worship, or, indeed,\r\nUnless you kneel'd to hear another name him.\r\n_S._ What was he call'd?\r\n_A._ We are not come to that;\r\nLet it suffice that you shall have the glory\r\nTo father what so brave a father got....\r\n_S._ Dost thou laugh?\r\nCome, whore, tell me your lover, or, by truth,\r\nI'll hew thy flesh to shreds; who is't?\"[465]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe laughs; the excess of shame and terror has given her courage; she\r\ninsults him, she sings; so like a woman!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_A._ (Sings) _Che morte piu dolce che morire per amore._\r\n_S._ Thus will I pull thy hair, and thus I'll drag\r\nThy lust be-leper'd body through the dust....\r\n(_Hales her up and down_)\r\n_A._ Be a gallant hangman....\r\nI leave revenge behind, and thou shalt feel't....\r\n(_To Vasquez._) Pish, do not beg for me, I prize my life\r\nAs nothing; if the man will needs be mad,\r\nWhy, let him take it.\"[466]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end all is discovered, and the two lovers know they must die. For\r\nthe last time, they see each other in Annabella's chamber, listening to\r\nthe noise of the feast below which shall serve for their funeral feast.\r\nGiovanni, who has made his resolve like a madman, sees Annabella richly\r\ndressed, dazzling. He regards her in silence, and remembers the past. He\r\nweeps and says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These are the funeral tears,\r\nShed on your grave; these furrow'd-up my cheeks\r\nWhen first I lov'd and knew not how to woo....\r\nGive me your hand: how sweetly life doth run\r\nIn these well-colour'd veins! How constantly\r\nThese palms do promise health!...\r\nKiss me again, forgive me.... Farewell.\"[467]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then stabs her, enters the banqueting room, with her heart upon his\r\ndagger:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Soranzo see this heart, which was thy wife's.\r\nThus I exchange it royally for thine.\"[468]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe kills him, and casting himself on the swords of banditti, dies. It\r\nwould seem that tragedy could go no further.\r\n\r\nBut it did go further; for if these are melodramas, they are sincere,\r\ncomposed, not like those of to-day, by Grub Street writers for peaceful\r\ncitizens, but by impassioned men, experienced in tragical arts, for a\r\nviolent, over-fed, melancholy race. From Shakespeare to Milton, Swift,\r\nHogarth, no race has been more glutted with coarse expressions and\r\nhorrors, and its poets supply them plentifully; Ford less so than\r\nWebster; the latter a sombre man, whose thoughts seem incessantly to be\r\nhaunting tombs and charnel-houses. \"Places in court,\" he says, \"are but\r\nlike beds in the hospital, where this man's head lies at that man's\r\nfoot, and so lower and lower.\"[469] Such are his images. No one has\r\nequalled Webster in creating desperate characters, utter wretches,\r\nbitter misanthropes,[470] in blackening and blaspheming human life,\r\nabove all, in depicting the shameless depravity and refined ferocity of\r\nItalian manners.[471] The Duchess of Malfi has secretly married her\r\nsteward Antonio, and her brother learns that she has children; almost\r\nmad[472] with rage and wounded pride, he remains silent, waiting until\r\nhe knows the name of the father; then he arrives all of a sudden, means\r\nto kill her, but so that she shall taste the lees of death. She must\r\nsuffer much, but above all, she must not die too quickly! She must\r\nsuffer in mind; these griefs are worse than the body's. He sends\r\nassassins to kill Antonio, and meanwhile comes to her in the dark, with\r\naffectionate words; he pretends to be reconciled, and suddenly shows her\r\nwaxen figures, covered with wounds, whom she takes for her slaughtered\r\nhusband and children. She staggers under the blow, and remains in gloom\r\nwithout crying out. Then she says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good comfortable fellow,\r\nPersuade a wretch that's broke upon the wheel\r\nTo have all his bones new set; entreat him live\r\nTo be executed again. Who must despatch me?...\r\n_Bosola._ Come, be of comfort, I will save your life.\r\n_Duchess._ Indeed, I have not leisure to tend\r\nSo small a business.\r\n_B._ Now, by my life, I pity you.\r\n_D._ Thou art a fool, then,\r\nTo waste thy pity on a thing so wretched\r\nAs cannot pity itself. I am full of daggers.\"[473]\r\n\r\n\r\nSlow words, spoken in a whisper, as in a dream, or as if she were\r\nspeaking of a third person. Her brother sends to her a company of\r\nmadmen, who leap and howl and rave around her in mournful wise; a\r\npitiful sight, calculated to unseat the reason; a kind of foretaste of\r\nhell. She says nothing, looking upon them; her heart is dead, her eyes\r\nfixed, with vacant stare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Cariola._ What think you of, madam?\r\n_Duchess._ Of nothing:\r\nWhen I muse thus, I sleep.\r\n_C._ Like a madman, with your eyes open?\r\n_D._ Dost thou think we shall know one another\r\nIn the other world?\r\n_C._ Yes, out of question.\r\n_D._ O that it were possible we might\r\nBut hold some two days' conference with the dead!\r\nFrom them I should learn somewhat, I am sure,\r\nI never shall know here. I'll teach thee a miracle;\r\nI am not mad yet, to my cause of sorrow:\r\nThe heaven o'er my head seems made of molten brass,\r\nThe earth of flaming sulphur, yet I am not mad.\r\nI am acquainted with sad misery\r\nAs the tann'd galley-slave is with his oar....\"[474]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this state, the limbs, like those of one who has been newly executed,\r\nstill quiver, but the sensibility is worn out; the miserable body only\r\nstirs mechanically; it has suffered too much. At last the gravedigger\r\ncomes with executioners, a coffin, and they sing before her a funeral\r\ndirge:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Duchess._ Farewell, Cariola...\r\nI pray thee, look thou giv'st my little boy\r\nSome syrup for his cold, and let the girl\r\nSay her prayers ere she sleep.--Now, what you please:\r\nWhat death?\r\n_Bosola._ Strangling; here are your executioners.\r\n_D._ I forgive them:\r\nThe apoplexy, catarrh, or cough o' the lungs\r\nWould do as much as they do.... My body\r\nBestow upon my women, will you?...\r\nGo, tell my brothers, when I am laid out,\r\nThey then may feed in quiet.\"[475]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the mistress the maid; the latter cries and struggles:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Cariola._ I will not die; I must not; I am contracted\r\nTo a young gentleman.\r\n_1st Executioner._ Here's your wedding-ring.\r\n_C._ If you kill me now,\r\nI am damn'd. I have not been at confession\r\nThis two years.\r\n_B._ When?[476]\r\n_C._ I am quick with child.\"[477]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey strangle her also, and the two children of the duchess. Antonio is\r\nassassinated; the cardinal and his mistress, the duke and his confidant,\r\nare poisoned or butchered; and the solemn words of the dying, in the\r\nmidst of this butchery, utter, as from funereal trumpets, a general\r\ncurse upon existence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are only like dead walls or vaulted graves,\r\nThat, ruin'd yield no echo. Fare you well....\r\nO this gloomy world!\r\nIn what a shadow, or deep pit of darkness,\r\nDoth womanish and fearful mankind live!\"[478]\r\n\r\n\"In all our quest of greatness,\r\nLike wanton boys, whose pastime is their care,\r\nWe follow after bubbles blown in the air.\r\nPleasure of life, what is't? only the good hours\r\nOf an ague; merely a preparative to rest,\r\nTo endure vexation....\r\nWhether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust,\r\nLike diamonds, we are cut with our own dust.\"[479]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will find nothing sadder or greater from the Edda to Lord Byron.\r\n\r\nWe can well imagine what powerful characters are necessary to sustain\r\nthese terrible dramas. All these personages are ready for extreme acts;\r\ntheir resolves break forth like blows of a sword; we follow, meet at\r\nevery change of scene their glowing eyes, wan lips, the starting of\r\ntheir muscles, the tension of their whole frame. Their powerful will\r\ncontracts their violent hands, and their accumulated passion breaks out\r\nin thunderbolts, which tear and ravage all around them, and in their own\r\nhearts. We know them, the heroes of this tragic population, Iago,\r\nRichard III, Lady Macbeth, Othello, Coriolanus, Hotspur, full of genius,\r\ncourage, desire, generally mad or criminal, always self-driven to the\r\ntomb. There are as many around Shakespeare as in his own works. Let me\r\nexhibit one character more, written by the same dramatist, Webster. No\r\none, except Shakespeare, has seen further into the depths of diabolical\r\nand unchained nature. The \"White Devil\" is the name which he gives to\r\nhis heroine. His Vittoria Corombona receives as her lover the Duke of\r\nBrachiano, and at the first interview dreams of the issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To pass away the time, I'll tell your grace\r\nA dream I had last night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certainly well related, and still better chosen, of deep meaning\r\nand very clear import. Her brother Flaminio says, aside:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Excellent devil! she hath taught him in a dream\r\nTo make away his duchess and her husband.\"[480]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, her husband, Camillo, is strangled, the Duchess poisoned, and\r\nVittoria, accused of the two crimes, is brought before the tribunal.\r\nStep by step, like a soldier brought to bay with his back against a\r\nwall, she defends herself, refuting and defying advocates and judges,\r\nincapable of blenching or quailing, clear in mind, ready in word, amid\r\ninsults and proofs, even menaced with death on the scaffold. The\r\nadvocate begins to speak in Latin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Vittoria._ Pray my lord, let him speak his usual tongue;\r\nI'll make no answer else.\r\n_Francisco de Medicis._ Why, you understand Latin.\r\n_V._ I do, sir; but amongst this auditory\r\nWhich come to hear my cause, the half or more\r\nMay be ignorant in't.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe wants a duel, bare-breasted, in open day, and challenges the\r\nadvocate:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am at the mark, sir: I'll give aim to you,\r\nAnd tell you how near you shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe mocks his legal phraseology, insults him, with biting irony:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Surely, my lords, this lawyer here hath swallow'd\r\nSome pothecaries' bills, or proclamations;\r\nAnd now the hard and undigestible words\r\nCome up, like stones we use give hawks for physic:\r\nWhy, this is Welsh to Latin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, to the strongest adjuration of the judges:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the point,\r\nFind me but guilty, sever head from body,\r\nWe'll part good friends; I scorn to hold my life\r\nAt yours, or any man's entreaty, sir....\r\nThese are but feigned shadows of my evils:\r\nTerrify babes, my lord, with painted devils;\r\nI am past such needless palsy. For your names\r\nOf whore and murderess, they proceed from you,\r\nAs if a man should spit against the wind;\r\nThe filth returns in's face.\"[481]\r\n\r\n\r\nArgument for argument: she has a parry for every blow: a parry and a\r\nthrust:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But take you your course: it seems you have beggar'd me first,\r\nAnd now would fain undo me. I have houses.\r\nJewels, and a poor remnant of crusadoes:\r\nWould those would make you charitable!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, in a harsher voice:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In faith, my lord, you might go pistol flies;\r\nThe sport would be more noble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey condemn her to be shut up in a house of convertites:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_V._ A house of convertites! What's that?\r\n_Monticelso._ A house of penitent whores.\r\n_V._ Do the noblemen in Rome\r\nErect it for their wives, that I am sent\r\nTo lodge there?\"[482]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sarcasm comes home like a sword-thrust; then another behind it; then\r\ncries and curses. She will not bend, she will not weep. She goes off\r\nerect, bitter and more haughty than ever:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will not weep;\r\nNo, I do scorn to call up one poor tear\r\nTo fawn on your injustice: bear me hence\r\nUnto this house of what's your mitigating title?\r\n_Mont._ Of convertites.\r\n_V._ It shall not be a house of convertites;\r\nMy mind shall make it honester to me\r\nThan the Pope's palace, and more peaceable\r\nThan thy soul, though thou art a cardinal.\"[483]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgainst her furious lover, who accuses her of unfaithfulness, she is as\r\nstrong as against her judges; she copes with him, casts in his teeth the\r\ndeath of his duchess, forces him to beg pardon, to marry her; she will\r\nplay the comedy to the end, at the pistol's mouth, with the\r\nshamelessness and courage of a courtesan and an empress;[484] snared at\r\nlast, she will be just as brave and more insulting when the dagger's\r\npoint threatens her:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall welcome death\r\nAs princes do some great ambassadors;\r\nI'll meet thy weapon half way.... 'Twas a manly blow;\r\nThe next thou giv'st, murder some sucking infant;\r\nAnd then thou wilt be famous.\"[485]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a woman unsexes herself, her actions transcend man's, and there is\r\nnothing which she will not suffer or dare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--Female Characters\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposed to this band of tragic characters, with their distorted\r\nfeatures, brazen fronts, combative attitudes, is a troop of sweet and\r\ntimid figures, pre-eminently tender-hearted, the most graceful and\r\nloveworthy whom it has been given to man to depict. In Shakespeare you\r\nwill meet them in Miranda, Juliet, Desdemona, Virgilia, Ophelia,\r\nCordelia, Imogen; but they abound also in the others; and it is a\r\ncharacteristic of the race to have furnished them, as it is of the drama\r\nto have represented them. By a singular coincidence, the women are more\r\nof women, the men more of men, here than elsewhere. The two natures go\r\neach to its extreme: in the one to boldness, the spirit of enterprise\r\nand resistance, the warlike, imperious, and unpolished character; in the\r\nother to sweetness, devotion, patience, inextinguishable\r\naffection[486]--a thing unknown in distant lands, in France especially\r\nso: a woman in England gives herself without drawing back, and places\r\nher glory and duty in obedience, forgiveness, adoration, wishing and\r\nprofessing only to be melted and absorbed daily deeper and deeper in him\r\nwhom she has freely and forever chosen.[487] It is this, an old German\r\ninstinct, which these great painters of instinct diffuse here, one and\r\nall: Penthea, Dorothea, in Ford and Greene; Isabella and the Duchess of\r\nMalfi, in Webster; Bianca, Ordella, Arethusa, Juliana, Euphrasia,\r\nAmoret, and others, in Beaumont and Fletcher: there are a score of them\r\nwho, under the severest tests and the strongest temptations, display\r\nthis wonderful power of self-abandonment and devotion.[488] The soul, in\r\nthis race, is at once primitive and serious. Women keep their purity\r\nlonger than elsewhere. They lose respect less quickly; weigh worth and\r\ncharacters less suddenly: they are less apt to think evil, and to take\r\nthe measure of their husbands. To this day, a great lady, accustomed to\r\ncompany, blushes in the presence of an unknown man, and feels bashful\r\nlike a little girl: the blue eyes are dropped, and a child-like shame\r\nflies to her rosy cheeks. Englishwomen have not the smartness, the\r\nboldness of ideas, the assurance of bearing, the precocity, which with\r\nthe French make of a young girl, in six months, a woman of intrigue and\r\nthe queen of a drawing-room.[489] Domestic life and obedience are more\r\neasy to them. More pliant and more sedentary, they are at the same time\r\nmore concentrated and introspective, more disposed to follow the noble\r\ndream called duty, which is hardly generated in mankind but by silence\r\nof the senses. They are not tempted by the voluptuous sweetness which in\r\nsouthern countries is breathed out in the climate, in the sky, in the\r\ngeneral spectacle of things; which dissolves every obstacle, which\r\ncauses privation to be looked upon as a snare and virtue as a theory.\r\nThey can rest content with dull sensations, dispense with excitement,\r\nendure weariness; and in this monotony of a regulated existence, fall\r\nback upon themselves, obey a pure idea, employ all the strength of their\r\nhearts in maintaining their moral dignity. Thus supported by innocence\r\nand conscience, they introduce into love a profound and upright\r\nsentiment, abjure coquetry, vanity, and flirtation: they do not lie nor\r\nsimper. When they love, they are not tasting a forbidden fruit, but are\r\nbinding themselves for their whole life. Thus understood, love becomes\r\nalmost a holy thing; the spectator no longer wishes to be spiteful or to\r\njest; women do not think of their own happiness, but of that of the\r\nloved ones; they aim not at pleasure, but at devotion. Euphrasia,\r\nrelating her history to Philaster, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My father oft would speak\r\nYour worth and virtue; and, as I did grow\r\nMore and more apprehensive, I did thirst\r\nTo see the man so prais'd; but yet all this\r\nWas but a maiden longing, to be lost\r\nAs soon as found; till sitting in my window,\r\nPrinting my thoughts in lawn, I saw a god,\r\nI thought (but it was you), enter our gates.\r\nMy blood flew out, and back again as fast,\r\nAs I had puff'd it forth and suck'd it in\r\nLike breath: Then was I call'd away in haste\r\nTo entertain you. Never was a man,\r\nHeav'd from a sheep-cote to a sceptre, rais'd\r\nSo high in thoughts as I: You left a kiss\r\nUpon these lips then, which I mean to keep\r\nFrom you forever. I did hear you talk,\r\nFar above singing! After you were gone,\r\nI grew acquainted with my heart, and search'd\r\nWhat stirr'd it so: Alas! I found it love;\r\nYet far from lust; for could I but have liv'd\r\nIn presence of you, I had had my end.\"[490]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had disguised herself as a page,[491] followed him, was his servant;\r\nwhat greater happiness for a woman than to serve on her knees the man\r\nshe loves? She let him scold her, threaten her with death, wound her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Blest be that hand!\r\nIt meant me well. Again, for pity's sake!\"[492]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo what he will, nothing but words of tenderness and adoration can\r\nproceed from this heart, these wan lips. Moreover, she takes upon\r\nherself a crime of which he is accused, contradicts him when he asserts\r\nhis guilt, is ready to die in his place. Still more, she is of use to\r\nhim with the Princess Arethusa, whom he loves; she justifies her rival,\r\nbrings about their marriage, and asks no other thanks but that she may\r\nserve them both. And strange to say, the princess is not jealous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Euphrasia._ Never, Sir, will I\r\nMarry; it is a thing within my vow:\r\nBut if I may have leave to serve the princess,\r\nTo see the virtues of her lord and her,\r\nI shall have hope to live.\r\n_Arethusa._... Come, live with me;\r\nLive free as I do. She that loves my lord,\r\nCurst be the wife that hates her!\"[493]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat notion of love have they in this country? Whence happens it that\r\nall selfishness, all vanity, all rancor, every little feeling, either\r\npersonal or base, flees at its approach? How comes it that the soul is\r\ngiven up wholly, without hesitation, without reserve, and only dreams\r\nthenceforth of prostrating and annihilating itself, as in the presence\r\nof a god? Biancha, thinking Cesario ruined, offers herself to him as his\r\nwife; and learning that he is not so, gives him up straightway, without\r\na murmur:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Biancha._ So dearly I respected both your fame\r\nAnd quality, that I would first have perish'd\r\nIn my sick thoughts, than e'er have given consent\r\nTo have undone your fortunes, by inviting\r\nA marriage with so mean a one as I am:\r\nI should have died sure, and no creature known\r\nThe sickness that had kill'd me... Now since I know\r\nThere is no difference 'twixt your birth and mine,\r\nNot much 'twixt our estates (if any be,\r\nThe advantage is on my side) I come willingly\r\nTo tender you the first-fruits of my heart,\r\nAnd am content t' accept you for my husband.\r\nNow when you are at the lowest....\r\n_Cesario._ Why, Biancha,\r\nReport has cozen'd thee; I am not fallen\r\nFrom my expected honors or possessions,\r\nTho' from the hope of birth-right.\r\n_B._ Are you not?\r\nThen I am lost again! I have a suit too;\r\nYou'll grant it, if you be a good man....\r\nPray do not talk of aught what I have said t'ye....\r\n... Pity me;\r\nBut never love me more!... I'll pray for you,\r\nThat you may have a virtuous wife, a fair one;\r\nAnd when I'm dead...\r\n_C._ Fy, fy!\r\n_B._ Think on me sometimes,\r\nWith mercy for this trespass!\r\n_C._ Let us kiss\r\nAt parting, as at coming!\r\n_B._ This I have\r\nAs a free dower to a virgin's grave,\r\nAll goodness dwell with you!\"[494]\r\n\r\n\r\nIsabella, Brachiano's duchess, is defrayed, insulted by her faithless\r\nhusband; to shield him from the vengeance of her family, she takes upon\r\nherself the blame of the rupture, purposely plays the shrew, and leaving\r\nhim at peace with his courtesan, dies embracing his picture. Arethusa\r\nallows herself to be wounded by Philaster, stays the people who would\r\nhold back the murderer's arm, declares that he has done nothing, that it\r\nis not he, prays for him, loves him in spite of all, even to the end, as\r\nthough all his acts were sacred, as if he had power of life and death\r\nover her. Ordella devotes herself, that the king, her husband, may have\r\nchildren;[495] she offers herself for a sacrifice, simply, without grand\r\nwords, with her whole heart:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Ordella._ Let it be what it may then, what it dare,\r\nI have a mind will hazard it.\r\n_Thierry._ But, hark you;\r\nWhat may that woman merit, makes this blessing?\r\n_O._ Only her duty, sir.\r\n_T._ 'Tis terrible!\r\n_O._ 'Tis so much the more noble.\r\n_T._ 'Tis full of fearful shadows!\r\n_O._ So is sleep, sir,\r\nOr anything that's merely ours, and mortal;\r\nWe were begotten gods else: but those fears,\r\nFeeling but once the fires of noble thoughts,\r\nFly, like the shapes of clouds we form, to nothing.\r\n_T._ Suppose it death!\r\n_O._ I do.\r\n_T._ And endless parting\r\nWith all we can call ours, with all our sweetness,\r\nWith youth, strength, pleasure, people, time, nay reason!\r\nFor in the silent grave, no conversation,\r\nNo joyful tread of friends, no voice of lovers,\r\nNo careful father's counsel, nothing's heard,\r\nNor nothing is, but all oblivion,\r\nDust and endless darkness: and dare you, woman,\r\nDesire this place?\r\n_O._ 'Tis of all sleeps the sweetest:\r\nChildren begin it to us, strong men seek it,\r\nAnd kings from height of all their painted glories\r\nFall, like spent exhalations, to this centre....\r\n_T._ Then you can suffer?\r\n_O._ As willingly as say it.\r\n_T._ Martell, a wonder!\r\nHere is a woman that dares die.--Yet, tell me,\r\nAre you a wife?\r\n_O._ I am, sir.\r\n_T._ And have children?--\r\nShe sighs and weeps!\r\n_O._ Oh, none, sir.\r\n_T._ Dare you venture\r\nFor a poor barren praise you ne'er shall hear,\r\nTo part with these sweet hopes?\r\n_O._ With all but Heaven.\"[496]\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not this prodigious? Can you understand how one human being can thus\r\nbe separated from herself, forget and lose herself in another? They do\r\nso lose themselves, as in an abyss. When they love in vain and without\r\nhope, neither reason nor life resist; they languish, grow mad, die like\r\nOphelia. Aspasia, forlorn,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Walks discontented, with her watry eyes\r\nBent on the earth. The unfrequented woods\r\nAre her delight; and when she sees a bank\r\nStuck full of flowers, she with a sigh will tell\r\nHer servants what a pretty place it were\r\nTo bury lovers in; and make her maids\r\nPluck 'em, and strew her over like a corse.\r\nShe carries with her an infectious grief,\r\nThat strikes all her beholders; she will sing\r\nThe mournful'st things that ever ear hath heard,\r\nAnd sigh and sing again; and when the rest\r\nOf our young ladies, in their wanton blood,\r\nTell mirthful tales in course, that fill the room\r\nWith laughter, she will with so sad a look\r\nBring forth a story of the silent death\r\nOf some forsaken virgin, which her grief\r\nWill put in such a phrase, that, ere she end,\r\nShe'll send them weeping one by one away.\"[497]\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a spectre about a tomb, she wanders forever about the remains of\r\nher destroyed love, languishes, grows pale, swoons, ends by causing\r\nherself to be killed. Sadder still are those who, from duty or\r\nsubmission, allow themselves to be married while their heart belongs to\r\nanother. They are not resigned, do not recover, like Pauline in\r\n\"Polyeucte.\" They are crushed to death. Penthea, in Ford's \"Broken\r\nHeart,\" is as upright, but not so strong, as Pauline; she is the English\r\nwife, not the Roman, stoical and calm.[498] She despairs sweetly,\r\nsilently, and pines to death. In her innermost heart she holds herself\r\nmarried to him to whom she has pledged her soul: it is the marriage of\r\nthe heart which in her eyes is alone genuine; the other is only\r\ndisguised adultery. In marrying Bassanes she has sinned against Orgilus;\r\nmoral infidelity is worse than legal infidelity, and thenceforth she is\r\nfallen in her own eyes. She says to her brother:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pray, kill me....\r\nKill me, pray; nay, will ye\r\n_Ithocles._ How does thy lord esteem thee?\r\n_P._ Such an one\r\nAs only you have made me; a faith-breaker,\r\nA spotted whore; forgive me, I am one--\r\nIn act, not in desires, the gods must witness....\r\nFor she's that wife to Orgilus, and lives\r\nIn known adultery with Bassanes,\r\nIs, at the best, a whore. Wilt kill me now?...\r\nThe handmaid to the wages\r\nOf country toil, drinks the untroubled streams\r\nWith leaping kids, and with the bleating lambs,\r\nAnd so allays her thirst secure; whiles I\r\nQuench my hot sighs with fleetings of my tears.\"[499]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith tragic greatness, from the height of her incurable grief, she\r\nthrows her gaze on life:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My glass of life, sweet princess, hath few minutes\r\nRemaining to run down; the sands are spent;\r\nFor by an inward messenger I feel\r\nThe summons of departure short and certain.... Glories\r\nOf human greatness are but pleasing dreams,\r\nAnd shadows soon decaying; on the stage\r\nOf my mortality, my youth hath acted\r\nSome scenes of vanity, drawn out at length\r\nBy varied pleasures, sweeten'd in the mixture,\r\nBut tragical in issue... That remedy\r\nMust be a winding-sheet, a fold of lead,\r\nAnd some untrod-on corner in the earth.\"[500]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no revolt, no bitterness; she affectionately assists her\r\nbrother who has caused her unhappiness; she tries to enable him to win\r\nthe woman he loves; feminine kindness and sweetness overflow in her in\r\nthe depths of her despair. Love here is not despotic, passionate, as in\r\nsouthern climes. It is only deep and sad; the source of life is dried\r\nup, that is all; she lives no longer, because she cannot; all go by\r\ndegrees--health, reason, soul; in the end she becomes mad, and behold\r\nher dishevelled, with wide staring eyes, with words that can hardly find\r\nutterance. For ten days she has not slept, and will not eat any more;\r\nand the same fatal thought continually afflicts her heart, amidst vague\r\ndreams of maternal tenderness and happiness brought to nought, which\r\ncome and go in her mind like phantoms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sure, if we were all sirens, we would sing pitifully,\r\nAnd 'twere a comely music, when in parts\r\nOne sung another's knell; the turtle sighs\r\nWhen he hath lost his mate; and yet some say\r\nHe must be dead first: 'tis a fine deceit\r\nTo pass away in a dream! indeed, I've slept\r\nWith mine eyes open, a great while. No falsehood\r\nEquals a broken faith; there's not a hair\r\nSticks on my head, but, like a leaden plummet,\r\nIt sinks me to the grave: I must creep thither;\r\nThe journey is not long....\r\nSince I was first a wife, I might have been\r\nMother to many pretty prattling babes;\r\nThey would have smiled when I smiled; and, for certain,\r\nI should have cried when they cried:--truly, brother,\r\nMy father would have pick'd me out a husband,\r\nAnd then my little ones had been no bastards;\r\nBut 'tis too late for me to marry now,\r\nI'm past child-bearing; Tis not my fault....\r\nSpare your hand;\r\nBelieve me, I'll not hurt it....\r\nComplain not though I wring it hard: I'll kiss it,\r\nOh, 'tis a fine soft palm!--hark, in thine ear;\r\nLike whom do I look, prithee?--nay, no whispering,\r\nGoodness! we had been happy; too much happiness\r\nWill make folk proud, they say....\r\nThere is no peace left for a ravish'd wife,\r\nWidow'd by lawless marriage; to all memory\r\nPenthea's, poor Penthea's name is strumpeted....\r\nForgive me; Oh! I faint.\"[501]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe dies, imploring that some gentle voice may sing her a plaintive air,\r\na farewell ditty, a sweet funeral song. I know nothing in the drama more\r\npure and touching.\r\n\r\nWhen we find a constitution of soul so new, and capable of such great\r\neffects, it behooves us to look at the bodies. Man's extreme actions\r\ncome not from his will, but his nature.[502] In order to understand the\r\ngreat tensions of the whole machine, we must look upon the whole--I mean\r\nman's temperament, the manner in which his blood flows, his nerves\r\nquiver, his muscles act, the moral interprets the physical, and human\r\nqualities have their root in the animal species. Consider then the\r\nspecies in this case--namely, the race; for the sisters of Shakespeare's\r\nOphelia and Virgilia, Goethe's Clara and Margaret, Otway's Belvidera,\r\nRichardson's Pamela, constitute a race by themselves, soft and fair,\r\nwith blue eyes, lily whiteness, blushing, of timid delicacy, serious\r\nsweetness, framed to yield, bend, cling. Their poets feel it clearly\r\nwhen they bring them on the stage; they surround them with the poetry\r\nwhich becomes them, the murmur of streams, the pendant willow-tresses,\r\nthe frail and humid flowers of the country, so like themselves:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The flower, that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor\r\nThe azure harebell, like thy veins; no, nor\r\nThe leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,\r\nOut-sweeten'd not thy breath.\"[503]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey make them sweet, like the south wind, which with its gentle breath\r\ncauses the violets to bend their heads, abashed at the slightest\r\nreproach, already half bowed down by a tender and dreamy\r\nmelancholy.[504] Philaster, speaking of Euphrasia, whom he takes to be a\r\npage, and who has disguised herself in order to be near him, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hunting the buck,\r\nI found him sitting by a fountain-side,\r\nOf which he borrow'd some to quench his thirst,\r\nAnd paid the nymph again as much in tears.\r\nA garland lay him by, made by himself,\r\nOf many several flowers, bred in the bay,\r\nStuck in that mystic order, that the rareness\r\nDelighted me: But ever when he turn'd\r\nHis tender eyes upon 'em, he would weep,\r\nAs if he meant to make 'em grow again.\r\nSeeing such pretty helpless innocence\r\nDwell in his face, I asked him all his story.\r\nHe told me, that his parents gentle dy'd,\r\nLeaving him to the mercy of the fields,\r\nWhich gave him roots; and of the crystal springs,\r\nWhich did not stop their courses; and the sun,\r\nWhich still, he thank'd him, yielded him his light.\r\nThen he took up his garland, and did shew\r\nWhat every flower, as country people hold,\r\nDid signify; and how all, order'd thus,\r\nExpress'd his grief: And, to my thoughts, did read\r\nThe prettiest lecture of his country art\r\nThat could be wish'd.... I gladly entertain'd him,\r\nWho was as glad to follow; and have got\r\nThe trustiest, loving'st, and the gentlest boy\r\nThat ever master kept.\"[505]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idyl is self-produced among these human flowers: the dramatic action\r\nis stopped before the angelic sweetness of their tenderness and modesty.\r\nSometimes even the idyl is born com plete and pure, and the whole\r\ntheatre is occupied by a sentimental and poetical kind of opera. There\r\nare two or three such plays in Shakespeare; in rude Jonson, \"The Sad\r\nShepherd\"; in Fletcher, \"The Faithful Shepherdess.\" Ridiculous titles\r\nnowadays, for they remind us of the interminable platitudes of d'Urfé,\r\nor the affected conceits of Florian; charming titles, if we note the\r\nsincere and overflowing poetry which they contain. Amoret, the faithful\r\nshepherdess, lives in an imaginary country, full of old gods, yet\r\nEnglish, like the dewy verdant landscapes in which Rubens sets his\r\nnymphs dancing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thro' yon same bending plain\r\nThat flings his arms down to the main,\r\nAnd thro' these thick woods, have I run,\r\nWhose bottom never kiss'd the sun\r\nSince the lusty spring began.\"...\r\n\r\n\"For to that holy wood is consecrate\r\nA virtuous well, about whose flow'ry banks\r\nThe nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds,\r\nBy the pale moon-shine, dipping oftentimes\r\nTheir stolen children, so to make them free\r\nFrom dying flesh, and dull mortality...[506]\r\n\r\n\"See the dew-drops, how they kiss\r\nEv'ry little flower that is;\r\nHanging on their velvet heads,\r\nLike a rope of christal beads.\r\nSee the heavy clouds low falling,\r\nAnd bright Hesperus down calling\r\nThe dead Night from underground.\"[507]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the plants and the aspects of the ever fresh English country,\r\nnow enveloped in a pale diaphanous mist, now glistening under the\r\nabsorbing sun, teeming with grasses so full of sap, so delicate, that in\r\nthe midst of their most brilliant splendor and their most luxuriant\r\nlife, we feel that to-morrow will wither them. There, on a summer night,\r\nthe young men and girls, after their custom,[508] go to gather flowers\r\nand plight their troth. Amoret and Perigot are together; Amoret,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fairer far\r\nThan the chaste blushing morn, or that fair star\r\nThat guides the wand'ring seaman thro' the deep,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nmodest like a virgin, and tender as a wife, says to Perigot:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do believe thee: 'Tis as hard for me\r\nTo think thee false, and harder, than for thee\r\nTo hold me foul.\"[509]\r\n\r\n\r\nStrongly as she is tried, her heart, once given, never draws back.\r\nPerigot, deceived, driven to despair, persuaded that she is unchaste,\r\nstrikes her with his sword, and casts her bleeding to the ground. The\r\n\"sullen shepherd\" throws her into a well; but the god lets fall \"a drop\r\nfrom his watery locks\" into the wound; the chaste flesh closes at the\r\ntouch of the divine water, and the maiden, recovering, goes once more in\r\nsearch of him she loves:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Speak, if thou be here,\r\nMy Perigot! Thy Amoret, thy dear,\r\nCalls on thy loved name.... 'Tis thy friend,\r\nThy Amoret; come hither, to give end\r\nTo these consumings. Look up, gentle boy,\r\nI have forgot those pains and dear annoy\r\nI suffer'd for thy sake, and am content\r\nTo be thy love again. Why hast thou rent\r\nThose curled locks, where I have often hung\r\nRibbons, and damask-roses, and have flung\r\nWaters distill'd to make thee fresh and gay,\r\nSweeter than nosegays on a bridal day?\r\nWhy dost thou cross thine arms, and hang thy face\r\nDown to thy bosom, letting fall apace,\r\nFrom those two little Heav'ns, upon the ground,\r\nShow'rs of more price, more orient, and more round,\r\nThan those that hang upon the moon's pale brow?\r\nCease these complainings, shepherd! I am now\r\nThe same I ever was, as kind and free,\r\nAnd can forgive before you ask of me:\r\nIndeed, I can and will.\"[510]\r\n\r\n\r\nWho could resist her sweet and sad smile? Still deceived, Perigot wounds\r\nher again; she falls, but without anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So this work hath end!\r\nFarewell, and live! be constant to thy friend\r\nThat loves thee next.\"[511]\r\n\r\n\r\nA nymph cures her, and at last Perigot, disabused, comes and throws\r\nhimself on his knees before her. She stretches out her arms; in spite of\r\nall that he had done, she was not changed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am thy love,\r\nThy Amoret, for evermore thy love!\r\nStrike once more on my naked breast, I'll prove\r\nAs constant still. Oh, could'st thou love me yet,\r\nHow soon could I my former griefs forget!\"[512]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the touching and poetical figures which these poets introduce\r\nin their dramas, or in connection with their dramas, amidst murders,\r\nassassinations, the clash of swords, the howl of slaughter, striving\r\nagainst the raging men who adore or torment them, like them carried to\r\nexcess, transported by their tenderness as the others by their violence;\r\nit is a complete exposition, as well as a perfect opposition of the\r\nfeminine instinct ending in excessive self-abandonment, and of masculine\r\nharshness ending in murderous inflexibility. Thus built up and thus\r\nprovided, the drama of the age was enabled to bring out the inner depths\r\nof man, and to set in motion the most powerful human emotions; to bring\r\nupon the stage Hamlet and Lear, Ophelia and Cordelia, the death of\r\nDesdemona and the butcheries of Macbeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: \"The very age and body of the time, his form and\r\npressure.\"--Shakespeare.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: Ben Jonson, \"Every Man in his Humour\"; \"Cynthia's Revels.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: \"The Defence of Poesie,\" ed. 1629, p. 562.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: \"Winter's Tale, Cymbeline, Julius Cæsar.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: Strype, in his \"Annals of the Reformation\" (1571),\r\nsays: \"Many now were wholly departed from the communion of the church,\r\nand came no more to hear divine service in their parish churches, nor\r\nreceived the holy sacrament, according to the laws of the realm.\"\r\nRichard Baxter, in his \"Life,\" published in 1696, says: \"We lived in\r\na country that had but little preaching at all....

Guillen de Castro, Perez\r\nde Montalvan, Tirzo de Molina, Ruiz de Alarcon, Agustin Moreto,\r\nsurrounding Calderon and Lope de Vega; Crayer, Van Oost, Rombouts, Van\r\nThulden, Vandyke, Honthorst, surrounding Rubens; Ford, Marlowe,\r\nMassinger, Webster, Beaumont, Fletcher, surrounding Shakespeare and Ben\r\nJonson. The first constitute the chorus, the others are the leading men.\r\nThey sing the same piece together, and at times the chorist is equal to\r\nthe solo artist; but only at times. Thus, in the dramas which I have\r\njust referred to, the poet occasionally reaches the summit of his art,\r\nhits upon a complete character, a burst of sublime passion; then he\r\nfalls back, gropes amid qualified successes, rough sketches, feeble\r\nimitations, and at last takes refuge in the tricks of his trade. It is\r\nnot in him, but in great men like Ben Jonson and Shakespeare, that we\r\nmust look for the attainment of his idea and the fulness of his art.\r\n\"Numerous were the wit-combats,\" says Fuller, \"betwixt him (Shakespeare)\r\nand Ben Jonson, which two I behold like a Spanish great galleon and an\r\nEnglish man-of-war. Master Jonson (like the former) was built far higher\r\nin learning; solid, but slow in his performances. Shakespeare, with the\r\nEnglish man-of-war, lesser in bulk, but lighter in sailing, could turn\r\nwith all tides, tack about and take advantage of all winds, by the\r\nquickness of his wit and invention.\"[513] Such was Ben Jonson physically\r\nand morally, and his portraits do but confirm this just and animated\r\noutline: a vigorous, heavy, and uncouth person; a broad and long face,\r\nearly disfigured by scurvy, a square jaw, large cheeks; his animal\r\norgans as much developed as those of his intellect: the sour aspect of a\r\nman in a passion or on the verge of a passion; to which add the body of\r\nan athlete, about forty years of age, \"mountain belly, ungracious gait.\"\r\nSuch was the outside, and the inside is like it. He was a genuine\r\nEnglishman, big and coarsely framed, energetic, combative, proud, often\r\nmorose, and prone to strange splenetic imaginations. He told Drummond\r\nthat for a whole night he imagined \"that he saw the Carthaginians and\r\nRomans fighting on his great toe.\"[514] Not that he is melancholic by\r\nnature; on the contrary, he loves to escape from himself by free and\r\nnoisy, unbridled merriment, by copious and varied converse, assisted by\r\ngood Canary wine, which he imbibes, and which ends by becoming a\r\nnecessity to him. These great phlegmatic butchers' frames require a\r\ngenerous liquor to give them a tone, and to supply the place of the sun\r\nwhich they lack. Expansive moreover, hospitable, even lavish, with a\r\nfrank imprudent spirit,[515] making him forget himself wholly before\r\nDrummond, his Scotch host, an over-rigid and malicious pedant, who has\r\nmarred his ideas and vilified his character.[516] What we know of his\r\nlife is in harmony with his person; he suffered much, fought much, dared\r\nmuch. He was studying at Cambridge, when his stepfather, a bricklayer,\r\nrecalled him, and taught him to use the trowel. He ran away, enlisted as\r\na common soldier, and served in the English army, at that time engaged\r\nagainst the Spaniards in the Low Countries, killed and despoiled a man\r\nin single combat, \"in the view of both armies.\" He was a man of bodily\r\naction, and he exercised his limbs in early life.[517] On his return to\r\nEngland, at the age of nineteen, he went on the stage for his\r\nlivelihood, and occupied himself also in touching up dramas. Having been\r\nchallenged, he fought a duel, was seriously wounded, but killed his\r\nadversary; for this he was cast into prison, and found himself \"nigh the\r\ngallows.\" A Catholic priest visited and converted him; quitting his\r\nprison penniless, at twenty years of age, he married. At last, four\r\nyears later, his first successful play was acted. Children came, he must\r\nearn bread for them; and he was not inclined to follow the beaten track\r\nto the end, being persuaded that a fine philosophy--a special nobleness\r\nand dignity—ought to be introduced into comedy--that it was necessary\r\nto follow the example of the ancients, to imitate their severity and\r\ntheir accuracy, to be above the theatrical racket and the common\r\nimprobabilities in which the vulgar delighted. He openly proclaimed his\r\nintention in his prefaces, sharply railed at his rivals, proudly set\r\nforth on the stage[518] his doctrines, his morality, his character. He\r\nthus made bitter enemies, who defamed him outrageously and before their\r\naudiences, whom he exasperated by the violence of his satires, and\r\nagainst whom he struggled without intermission to the end. He did more,\r\nhe constituted himself a judge of the public corruption, sharply\r\nattacked the reigning vices, \"fearing no strumpet's drugs, nor ruffian's\r\nstab.\"[519] He treated his hearers like schoolboys, and spoke to them\r\nalways like a censor and a master. If necessary, he ventured further.\r\nHis companions, Marston and Chapman, had been committed to prison for\r\nsome reflections on the Scotch in one of their pieces called\r\n\"Eastward-Hoe\"; and the report spreading that they were in danger of\r\nlosing their noses and ears, Jonson, who had written part of the piece,\r\nvoluntarily surrendered himself a prisoner, and obtained their pardon.\r\nOn his return, amid the feasting and rejoicing, his mother showed him a\r\nviolent poison which she intended to put into his drink, to save him\r\nfrom the execution of the sentence; and \"to show that she was not a\r\ncoward,\" adds Jonson, \"she had resolved to drink first.\" We see that in\r\nvigorous actions he found examples in his own family. Toward the end of\r\nhis life, money was scarce with him; he was liberal, improvident; his\r\npockets always had holes in them, and his hand was always ready to give;\r\nthough he had written a vast quantity, he was still obliged to write in\r\norder to live. Paralysis came on, his scurvy became worse, dropsy set\r\nin. He could not leave his room, nor walk without assistance. His last\r\nplays did not succeed. In the epilogue to the \"New Inn\" he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you expect more than you had to-night,\r\nThe maker is sick and sad....\r\nAll that his faint and fait'ring tongue doth crave,\r\nIs, that you not impute it to his brain,\r\nThat's yet unhurt, altho, set round with pain,\r\nIt cannot long hold out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHis enemies brutally insulted him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thy Pegasus...\r\nHe had bequeathed his belly unto thee,\r\nTo hold that little learning which is fled\r\nInto thy guts from out thy emptye head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nInigo Jones, his colleague, deprived him of the patronage of the court.\r\nHe was obliged to beg a supply of money from the Lord Treasurer, then\r\nfrom the Earl of Newcastle:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Disease, the enemy, and his engineers,\r\nWant, with the rest of his concealed compeers,\r\nHave cast a trench about me, now five years....\r\nThe muse not peeps out, one of hundred days;\r\nBut lies blocked up and straitened, narrowed in,\r\nFixed to the bed and boards, unlike to win\r\nHealth, or scarce breath, as she had never been.\"[520]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis wife and children were dead; he lived alone, forsaken, waited on by\r\nan old woman. Thus almost always sadly and miserably is dragged out and\r\nends the last act of the human comedy. After so many years, after so\r\nmany sustained efforts, amid so much glory and genius, we find a poor\r\nshattered body, drivelling and suffering, between a servant and a\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--His Freedom and Precision of Style\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the life of a combatant, bravely endured, worthy of the\r\nseventeenth century by its crosses and its energy; courage and force\r\nabounded throughout. Few writers have labored more, and more\r\nconscientiously; his knowledge was vast, and in this age of eminent\r\nscholars he was one of the best classics of his time, as deep as he was\r\naccurate and thorough, having studied the most minute details and\r\nunderstood the true spirit of ancient life. It was not enough for him to\r\nhave stored his mind from the best writers, to have their whole works\r\ncontinually in his mind, to scatter his pages whether he would or no,\r\nwith recollections of them. He dug into the orators, critics,\r\nscholiasts, grammarians, and compilers of inferior rank; he picked up\r\nstray fragments; he took characters, jokes, refinements, from Athenæus,\r\nLibanius, Philostratus. He had so well entered into and digested the\r\nGreek and Latin ideas, that they were incorporated with his own. They\r\nenter into his speech without incongruity; they spring forth in him as\r\nvigorous as at their first birth; he originates even when he remembers.\r\nOn every subject he had this thirst for knowledge, and this gift of\r\nmastering knowledge. He knew alchemy when he wrote the \"Alchemist.\" He\r\nis familiar with alembics, retorts, receivers, as if he had passed his\r\nlife seeking after the philosopher's stone. He explains incineration,\r\ncalcination, imbibition, rectification, reverberation, as well as\r\nAgrippa and Paracelsus. If he speaks of cosmetics,[521] he brings out a\r\nshopful of them; we might make out of his plays a dictionary of the\r\noaths and costumes of courtiers; he seems to have a specialty in all\r\nbranches. A still greater proof of his force is, that his learning in no\r\nwise mars his vigor; heavy as is the mass with which he loads himself,\r\nhe carries it without stooping. This wonderful mass of reading and\r\nobservation suddenly begins to move, and falls like a mountain on the\r\noverwhelmed reader. We must hear Sir Epicure Mammon unfold the vision of\r\nsplendors and debauchery, in which he means to plunge, when he has\r\nlearned to make gold. The refined and unchecked impurities of the Roman\r\ndecadence, the splendid obscenities of Heliogabalus, the gigantic\r\nfancies of luxury and lewdness, tables of gold spread with foreign\r\ndainties, draughts of dissolved pearls, nature devastated to provide a\r\nsingle dish, the many crimes committed by sensuality against nature,\r\nreason, and justice, the delight in defying and outraging law--all\r\nthese images pass before the eyes with the dash of a torrent and the\r\nforce of a great river. Phrase follows phrase without intermission,\r\nideas and facts crowd into the dialogue to paint a situation, to give\r\nclearness to a character, produced from this deep memory, directed by\r\nthis solid logic, launched by this powerful reflection. It is a pleasure\r\nto see him advance weighted with so many observations and recollections,\r\nloaded with technical details and learned reminiscences, without\r\ndeviation or pause, a genuine literary Leviathan, like the war elephants\r\nwhich used to bear towers, men, weapons, machines, on their backs, and\r\nran as swiftly with their freight as a nimble steed.\r\n\r\nIn the great dash of this heavy attempt, he finds a path which suits\r\nhim. He has his style. Classical erudition and education made him a\r\nclassic, and he writes like his Greek models and his Roman masters. The\r\nmore we study the Latin races and literatures in contrast with the\r\nTeutonic, the more fully we become convinced that the proper and\r\ndistinctive gift of the first is the art of development; that is, of\r\ndrawing up ideas in continuous rows, according to the rules of rhetoric\r\nand eloquence, by studied transitions, with regular progress, without\r\nshock or bounds. Jonson received from his acquaintance with the ancients\r\nthe habit of decomposing ideas, unfolding them bit by bit in natural\r\norder, making himself understood and believed. From the first thought to\r\nthe final conclusion, he conducts the reader by a continuous and uniform\r\nascent. The track never fails with him as with Shakespeare. He does not\r\nadvance like the rest by abrupt intuitions, but by consecutive\r\ndeductions; we can walk with him without need of bounding, and we are\r\ncontinually kept upon the straight path: antithesis of words unfolds\r\nantithesis of thoughts; symmetrical phrases guide the mind through\r\ndifficult ideas; they are like barriers set on either side of the road\r\nto prevent our falling into the ditch. We do not meet on our way\r\nextraordinary, sudden, gorgeous images, which might dazzle or delay us;\r\nwe travel on, enlightened by moderate and sustained metaphors. Jonson\r\nhas all the methods of Latin art; even, when he wishes it, especially on\r\nLatin subjects, he has the last and most erudite, the brilliant\r\nconciseness of Seneca and Lucan, the squared, equipoised, filed-off\r\nantithesis, the most happy and studied artifices of oratorical\r\narchitecture.[522] Other poets are nearly visionaries; Jonson is almost\r\na logician.\r\n\r\nHence his talent, his successes, and his faults: if he has a better\r\nstyle and better plots than the others, he is not, like them, a creator\r\nof souls. He is too much of a theorist, too preoccupied by rules. His\r\nargumentative habits spoil him when he seeks to shape and motion\r\ncomplete and living men. No one is capable of fashioning these unless he\r\npossesses, like Shakespeare, the imagination of a seer. The human being\r\nis so complex that the logician who perceives his different elements in\r\nsuccession can hardly study them all, much less gather them all in one\r\nflash, so as to produce the dramatic response or action in which they\r\nare concentrated and which should manifest them. To discover such\r\nactions and responses, we need a kind of inspiration and fever. Then the\r\nmind works as in a dream. The characters move within the poet, almost\r\ninvoluntarily: he waits for them to speak, he remains motionless,\r\nhearing their voices, wholly wrapt in contemplation, in order that he\r\nmay not disturb the inner drama which they are about to act in his soul.\r\nThat is his artifice: to let them alone. He is quite astonished at their\r\ndiscourse; as he observes them he forgets that it is he who invents\r\nthem. Their mood, character, education, disposition of mind, situation,\r\nattitude, and actions, form within him so well-connected a whole, and so\r\nreadily unite into palpable and solid beings, that he dares not\r\nattribute to his reflection or reasoning a creation so vast and speedy.\r\nBeings are organized in him as in nature; that is, of themselves, and by\r\na force which the combinations of his art could not replace.[523] Jonson\r\nhas nothing wherewith to replace it but these combinations of art. He\r\nchooses a general idea--cunning, folly, severity--and makes a person out\r\nof it. This person is called Crites, Asper, Sordido, Deliro, Pecunia,\r\nSubtil, and the transparent name indicates the logical process which\r\nproduced it. The poet took an abstract quality, and putting together all\r\nthe actions to which it may give rise, trots it out on the stage in a\r\nman's dress. His characters, like those of La Bruyère and Theophrastus,\r\nwere hammered out of solid deductions. Now it is a vice selected from\r\nthe catalogue of moral philosophy, sensuality thirsting for gold: this\r\nperverse double inclination becomes a personage, Sir Epicure Mammon;\r\nbefore the alchemist, before the famulus, before his friend, before his\r\nmistress, in public or alone, all his words denote a greed of pleasure\r\nand of gold, and they express nothing more.[524] Now it is a mania\r\ngathered from the old sophists, a babbling with horror of noise; this\r\nform of mental pathology becomes a personage, Morose; the poet has the\r\nair of a doctor who has undertaken to record exactly all the desires of\r\nspeech, all the necessities of silence, and to record nothing else. Now\r\nhe picks out a ridicule, an affectation, a species of folly, from the\r\nmanners of the dandies and the courtiers; a mode of swearing, an\r\nextravagant style, a habit of gesticulating, or any other oddity\r\ncontracted by vanity or fashion. The hero whom he covers with these\r\neccentricities is overloaded by them. He disappears beneath his enormous\r\ntrappings; he drags them about with him everywhere; he cannot get rid of\r\nthem for an instant. We no longer see the man under the dress; he is\r\nlike a manikin, oppressed under a cloak, too heavy for him. Sometimes,\r\ndoubtless, his habits of geometrical construction produce personages\r\nalmost life-like. Bobadil, the grave boaster; Captain Tucca, the begging\r\nbully, inventive buffoon, ridiculous talker; Amorphus the traveller, a\r\npedantic doctor of good manners, laden with eccentric phrases, create as\r\nmuch illusion as we can wish; but it is because they are flitting\r\ncomicalities and low characters. It is not necessary for a poet to study\r\nsuch creatures; it is enough that he discovers in them three or four\r\nleading features; it is of little consequence if they always present\r\nthemselves with the same attitudes; they produce laughter, like the\r\nCountess d'Escarbagans or any of the Fâcheux in Molière; we want\r\nnothing else of them. On the contrary, the others weary and repel us.\r\nThey are stage-masks, not living figures. Having acquired a fixed\r\nexpression, they persist to the end of the piece in their unvarying\r\ngrimace or their eternal frown. A man is not an abstract passion. He\r\nstamps the vices and virtues which he possesses with his individual\r\nmark. These vices and virtues receive, on entering into him, a bent and\r\nform which they have not in others. No one is unmixed sensuality. Take a\r\nthousand sensualists, and you will find a thousand different modes of\r\nsensuality; for there are a thousand paths, a thousand circumstances and\r\ndegrees, in sensuality. If Jonson wanted to make Sir Epicure Mammon a\r\nreal being, he should have given him the kind of disposition, the\r\nspecies of education, the manner of imagination, which produce\r\nsensuality. When we wish to construct a man, we must dig down to the\r\nfoundations of mankind; that is, we must define to ourselves the\r\nstructure of his bodily machine, and the primitive gait of his mind.\r\nJonson has not dug sufficiently deep, and his constructions are\r\nincomplete; he has built on the surface, and he has built but a single\r\nstory. He was not acquainted with the whole man and he ignored man's\r\nbasis; he put on the stage and gave a representation of moral treatises,\r\nfragments of history, scraps of satire; he did not stamp new beings on\r\nthe imagination of mankind.\r\n\r\nHe possesses all other gifts, and in particular the classical; first of\r\nall, the talent for composition. For the first time we see a connected,\r\nwell-contrived plot, a complete intrigue, with its beginning, middle,\r\nand end; subordinate actions well arranged, well combined; an interest\r\nwhich grows and never flags; a leading truth which all the events tend\r\nto demonstrate; a ruling idea which all the characters unite to\r\nillustrate; in short, an art like that which Molière and Racine were\r\nabout to apply and teach. He does not, like Shakespeare, take a novel\r\nfrom Greene, a chronicle from Holinshed, a life from Plutarch, such as\r\nthey are, to cut them into scenes, irrespective of likelihood,\r\nindifferent as to order and unity, caring only to set up men, at times\r\nwandering into poetic reveries, at need finishing up the piece abruptly\r\nwith a recognition or a butchery. He governs himself and his characters;\r\nhe wills and he knows all that they do, and all that he does. But beyond\r\nhis habits of Latin regularity, he possesses the great faculty of his\r\nage and race--the sentiment of nature and existence, the exact knowledge\r\nof precise detail, the power in frankly and boldly handling frank\r\npassions. This gift is not wanting in any writer of the time; they do\r\nnot fear words that are true, shocking, and striking details of the\r\nbedchamber or medical study; the prudery of modern England and the\r\nrefinement of monarchical France veil not the nudity of their figures,\r\nor dim the coloring of their pictures. They live freely, amply, amidst\r\nliving things; they see the ins and outs of lust raging without any\r\nfeeling of shame, hypocrisy, or palliation; and they exhibit it as they\r\nsee it, Jonson as boldly as the rest, occasionally more boldly than the\r\nrest, strengthened as he is by the vigor and ruggedness of his athletic\r\ntemperament, by the extraordinary exactness and abundance of his\r\nobservations and his knowledge. Add also his moral loftiness, his\r\nasperity, his powerful chiding wrath, exasperated and bitter against\r\nvice, his will strengthened by pride and by conscience:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With an armed and resolved hand,\r\nI'll strip the ragged follies of the time\r\nNaked as at their birth... and with a whip of steel,\r\nPrint wounding lashes in their iron ribs.\r\nI fear no mood stampt in a private brow,\r\nWhen I am pleas'd t' unmask a public vice.\r\nI fear no strumpet's drugs, nor ruffian's stab,\r\nShould I detect their hateful luxuries;\"[525]\r\n\r\n\r\nabove all, a scorn of base compliance, an open disdain for\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those jaded wits\r\nThat run a broken pace for common hire,\"[526]\r\n\r\n\r\nan enthusiasm, or deep love of\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A happy muse,\r\nBorne on the wings of her immortal thought,\r\nThat kicks at earth with a disdainful heel,\r\nAnd beats at heaven gates with her bright hoofs.\"[527]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the energies which he brought to the drama and to comedy; they\r\nwere great enough to insure him a high and separate position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--The Dramas Catiline and Sejanus\r\n\r\n\r\nFor whatever Jonson undertakes, whatever be his faults, haughtiness,\r\nrough-handling, predilection for morality and the past, antiquarian and\r\ncensorious instincts, he is never little or dull. It signifies nothing\r\nthat in his latinized tragedies, \"Sejanus, Catiline,\" he is fettered\r\nby the worship of the old worn models of the Roman decadence; nothing\r\nthat he plays the scholar, manufactures Ciceronian harangues, hauls in\r\nchoruses imitated from Seneca, holds forth in the style of Lucan and the\r\nrhetors of the empire; he more than once attains a genuine accent;\r\nthrough his pedantry, heaviness, literary adoration of the ancients,\r\nnature forces its way; he lights, at his first attempt, on the\r\ncrudities, horrors, gigantic lewdness, shameless depravity of imperial\r\nRome; he takes in hand and sets in motion the lusts and ferocities, the\r\npassions of courtesans and princesses, the daring of assassins and of\r\ngreat men, which produced Messalina, Agrippina, Catiline, Tiberius.[528]\r\nIn the Rome which he places before us we go boldly and straight to the\r\nend; justice and pity oppose no barriers. Amid these customs of victors\r\nand slaves, human nature is upset, corruption and villainy are held as\r\nproofs of insight and energy. Observe how, in \"Sejanus,\" assassination\r\nis plotted and carried out with marvellous coolness. Livia discusses\r\nwith Sejanus the methods of poisoning her husband, in a clear style,\r\nwithout circumlocution, as if the subject were how to gain a lawsuit or\r\nto serve up a dinner. There are no equivocations, no hesitation, no\r\nremorse in the Rome of Tiberius. Glory and virtue consist in power;\r\nscruples are for base minds; the mark of a lofty heart is to desire all\r\nand to dare all. Macro says rightly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Men's fortune there is virtue; reason their will;\r\nTheir license, law; and their observance, skill.\r\nOccasion is their foil; conscience, their stain;\r\nProfit, their lustre; and what else is, vain.\"[529]\r\n\r\n\r\nSejanus addresses Livia thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Royal lady,...\r\nYet, now I see your wisdom, judgment, strength,\r\nQuickness, and will, to apprehend the means\r\nTo your own good and greatness, I protest\r\nMyself through rarified, and turn'd all aflame\r\nIn your affection.\"[530]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the loves of the wolf and his mate; he praises her for being\r\nso ready to kill. And observe in one moment the morals of a prostitute\r\nappear behind the manners of the poisoner. Sejanus goes out, and\r\nimmediately, like a courtesan, Livia turns to her physician, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How do I look to-day?\r\n_Eudemus._ Excellent clear, believe it. This same fucus\r\nWas well laid on.\r\n_Livia._ Methinks 'tis here not white.\r\n_E._ Lend me your scarlet, lady. 'Tis the sun\r\nHath giv'n some little taint unto the ceruse,\r\nYou should have us'd of the white oil I gave you.\r\nSejanus, for your love! His very name\r\nCommandeth above Cupid or his shafts....\r\n[_Paints her cheeks._]\r\n\"'Tis now well, lady, you should\r\nUse of the dentrifice I prescrib'd you too,\r\nTo clear your teeth, and the prepar'd pomatum,\r\nTo smooth the skin. A lady cannot be\r\nToo curious of her form, that still would hold\r\nThe heart of such a person, made her captive,\r\nAs you have his: who, to endear him more\r\nIn your clear eye, hath put away his wife...'\"\r\nFair Apicata, and made spacious room\r\nTo your new pleasures.\r\n_L._ Have not we return'd\r\nThat with our hate to Drusus, and discovery\r\nOf all his counsels?...\r\n_E._ When will you take some physic, lady?\r\n_L._ When\r\nI shall, Eudemus: but let Drusus' drug\r\nBe first prepar'd.\r\n_E._ Were Lygdus made, that's done....\r\nI'll send you a perfume, first to resolve\r\nAnd procure sweat, and then prepare a bath\r\nTo cleanse and clear the cutis; against when\r\nI'll have an excellent new fucus made\r\nResistive 'gainst the sun, the rain or wind,\r\nWhich you shall lay on with a breath or oil,\r\nAs you best like, and last some fourteen hours.\r\nThis change came timely, lady, for your health.\"[531]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe ends by congratulating her on her approaching change of husbands;\r\nDrusus was injuring her complexion; Sejanus is far preferable; a\r\nphysiological and practical conclusion. The Roman apothecary kept on the\r\nsame shelf his medicine-chest, his chest of cosmetics, and his box of\r\npoisons.[532]\r\n\r\nAfter this we find one after another all the scenes of Roman life\r\nunfolded, the bargain of murder, the comedy of justice, the\r\nshamelessness of flattery, the anguish and vacillation of the Senate.\r\nWhen Sejanus wishes to buy a conscience, he questions, jokes, plays\r\nround the offer he is about to make, throws it out as if in pleasantry,\r\nso as to be able to withdraw it, if need be; tempt, on the crudities,\r\nhorrors, gigantic lewdness, shameless depravity of imperial Rome; he\r\ntakes in hand and sets in motion the lusts and ferocities, the passions\r\nof courtesans and princesses, the daring of assassins and of great men,\r\nwhich produced Messalina, Agrippina, Catiline, Tiberius.[533] In the\r\nRome which he places before us we go boldly and straight to the end;\r\njustice and pity oppose no barriers. Amid these customs of victors and\r\nslaves, human nature is upset, corruption and villainy are held as\r\nproofs of insight and energy.

The Roman apothecary kept on the\r\nsame shelf his medicine-chest, his chest of cosmetics, and his box of\r\npoisons.[537]\r\n\r\nAfter this we find one after another all the scenes of Roman life\r\nunfolded, the bargain of murder, the comedy of justice, the\r\nshamelessness of flattery, the anguish and vacillation of the Senate.\r\nWhen Sejanus wishes to buy a conscience, he questions, jokes, plays\r\nround the offer he is about to make, throws it out as if in pleasantry,\r\nso as to be able to withdraw it, if need be; then, when the intelligent\r\nlook of the rascal, whom he is trafficking with, shows that he is\r\nunderstood:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Protest not,\r\nThy looks are vows to me....\r\nThou art a man, made to make consuls. Go.\"[538]\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the senator Latiaris in his own house storms before his\r\nfriend Sabinus against tyranny, openly expresses a desire for liberty,\r\nprovoking him to speak. Then two spies who were hid \"between the roof\r\nand ceiling,\" cast themselves on Sabinus, crying, \"Treason to Cæsar!\"\r\nand drag him, with his face covered, before the tribunal, thence to \"be\r\nthrown upon the Gemonies.\"[539] So, when the Senate is assembled,\r\nTiberius has chosen beforehand the accusers of Silius, and their parts\r\ndistributed to them. They mumble in a corner, whilst aloud is heard, in\r\nthe emperor's presence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cæsar,\r\nLive long and happy, great and royal Cæsar;\r\nThe gods preserve thee and thy modesty,\r\nThy wisdom and thy innocence....\r\nGuard\r\nHis meekness, Jove, his piety, his care,\r\nHis bounty.\"[540]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the herald cites the accused; Varro, the consul, pronounces the\r\nindictment; After hurls upon them his bloodthirsty eloquence: the\r\nsenators get excited; we see laid bare, as in Tacitus and Juvenal, the\r\ndepths of Roman servility, hypocrisy, insensibility, the venomous craft\r\nof Tiberius. At last, after so many others, the turn of Sejanus comes.\r\nThe fathers anxiously assemble in the temple of Apollo; for some days\r\npast Tiberius has seemed to be trying to contradict himself; one day he\r\nappoints the friends of his favorite to high places, and the next day\r\nsets his enemies in eminent positions. The senators mark the face of\r\nSejanus, and know not what to anticipate; Sejanus is troubled, then\r\nafter a moment's cringing is more arrogant than ever. The plots are\r\nconfused, the rumors contradictory. Macro alone is in the confidence of\r\nTiberius, and soldiers are seen, drawn up at the porch of the temple,\r\nready to enter at the slightest commotion. The formula of convocation is\r\nread, and the council marks the names of those who do not respond to the\r\nsummons; then Regulus addresses them, and announces that Cæsar\r\n\r\n\r\nPropounds to this grave Senate, the bestowing\r\nUpon the man he loves, honor'd Sejanus,\r\nThe tribunitial dignity and power:\r\nHere are his letters, signed with his signet.\r\nWhat pleaseth now the Fathers to be done?\r\n\"_Senators._ Read, read them, open, publicly read them.\r\n_Cotta._ Cæsar hath honor'd his own greatness much\r\nIn thinking of this act.\r\n_Trio._\tIt was a thought\r\nHappy, and worthy Cæsar.\r\n_Latiaris._ And\tthe lord\r\nAs worthy it, on whom it is directed!\r\n_Haterius._ Most worthy!\r\n_Sanquinius._ Rome did never boast the virtue\r\nThat could give envy bounds, but his: Sejanus--\r\n_1st Sen._ Honor'd and noble!\r\n_2d Sen._ Good and great Sejanus!\r\n_Prœcones._ Silence!\"[541]\r\n\r\n\r\nTiberius's letter is read. First, long, obscure, and vague phrases,\r\nmingled with indirect protestations and accusations, foreboding\r\nsomething and revealing nothing. Suddenly comes an insinuation against\r\nSejanus. The fathers are alarmed, but the next line reassures them. A\r\nword or two further on the same insinuation is repeated with greater\r\nexactness. \"Some there be that would interpret this his public severity\r\nto be particular ambition; and that, under a pretext of service to us,\r\nhe doth but remove his own lets: alleging the strengths he hath made to\r\nhimself, by the praetorian soldiers, by his faction in court and Senate,\r\nby the offices he holds himself, and confers on others, his popularity\r\nand dependents, his urging (and almost driving) us to this our unwilling\r\nretirement, and lastly, his aspiring to be our son-in-law.\" The fathers\r\nrise: \"This is strange!\" Their eager eyes are fixed on the letter, on\r\nSejanus, who perspires and grows pale; their thoughts are busy with\r\nconjectures, and the words of the letter fall one by one, amidst a\r\nsepulchral silence, caught up as they fall with all devouring and\r\nattentive eagerness. The senators anxiously weigh the value of these\r\nshifty expressions, fearing to compromise themselves with the favorite\r\nor with the prince, all feeling that they must understand, if they value\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'_Your wisdoms, conscript fathers, are able to examine, and censure\r\nthese suggestions. But, were they left to our absolving voice, we durst\r\npronounce them, as we think them, most malicious._'\r\n_Senator._ O, he has restor'd all; list.\r\n_Prœco. 'Yet are they offered to be averr'd, and on the lives of the\r\ninformers._'\"[542]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this word the letter becomes menacing. Those next Sejanus forsake\r\nhim. \"Sit farther.... Let's remove!\" The heavy Sanquinius leaps panting\r\nover the benches. The soldiers come in; then Macro. And now, at last,\r\nthe letter orders the arrest of Sejanus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Regulus._ Take him hence;\r\nAnd all the gods guard Cæsar!\r\n_Trio._ Take him hence.\r\n_Haterius._ Hence.\r\n_Cotta._ To the dungeon with him.\r\n_Sanquinius._ He deserves it.\r\n_Senator._ Crown all our doors with bays.\r\n_San._ And let an ox,\r\nWith gilded horns and garlands, straight be led\r\nUnto the Capitol.\r\n_Hat._ And sacrific'd\r\nTo Jove, for Cæsar's safety.\r\n_Tri._ All our gods\r\nBe present still to Cæsar!...\r\n_Cot._ Let all the traitor's titles be defac'd.\r\n_Tri._ His images and statues be pull'd down....\r\n_Sen._ Liberty, liberty, liberty! Lead on,\r\nAnd praise to Macro that hath saved Rome!\"[543]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the baying of a furious pack of hounds, let loose at last on him,\r\nunder whose hand they had crouched, and who had for a long time beaten\r\nand bruised them. Jonson discovered in his own energetic soul the energy\r\nof these Roman passions; and the clearness of his mind, added to his\r\nprofound knowledge, powerless to construct characters, furnished him\r\nwith general ideas and striking incidents, which suffice to depict\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Comedies\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was to this that he turned his talent. Nearly all his work\r\nconsists of comedies, not sentimental and fanciful as Shakespeare's, but\r\nimitative and satirical, written to represent and correct follies and\r\nvices. He introduced a new model; he had a doctrine; his masters were\r\nTerence and Plautus. He observes the unity of time and place, almost\r\nexactly. He ridicules the authors who, in the same play,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Make a child now swaddled, to proceed\r\nMan, and then shoot up, in one beard and weed,\r\nPast threescore years; or, with three rusty swords,\r\nAnd help of some few foot and half-foot words,\r\nFight over York and Lancaster's long jars....\r\nHe rather prays you will be pleas'd to see.\"[544]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wishes to represent on the stage\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One such to-day, as other plays shou'd be;\r\nWhere neither chorus wafts you o'er the seas,\r\nNor creaking throne comes down the boys to please:\r\nNor nimble squib is seen to' make afeard\r\nThe gentlewomen....\r\nBut deeds, and language, such as men do use....\r\nYou, that have so grac'd monsters, may like men.\"[545]\r\n\r\n\r\nMen, as we see them in the streets, with their whims and humors--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When some one peculiar quality\r\nDoth so possess a man, that it doth draw\r\nAll his affects, his spirits, and his powers\r\nIn their conductions, all to run one way,\r\nThis may be truly said to be a humor.\"[546]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is these humors which he exposes to the light, not with the artist's\r\ncuriosity, but with the moralist's hate:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will scourge those apes,\r\nAnd to these courteous eyes oppose a mirror,\r\nAs large as is the stage whereon we act;\r\nWhere they shall see the time's deformity\r\nAnatomized in every nerve, and sinew,\r\nWith constant courage, and contempt of fear....\r\nMy strict hand\r\nWas made to seize on vice, and with a gripe\r\nSqueeze out the humour of such spongy souls,\r\nAs lick up every idle vanity.\"[547]\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless a determination so strong and decided does violence to the\r\ndramatic spirit. Jonson's comedies are not rarely harsh; his characters\r\nare too grotesque, laboriously constructed, mere automatons; the poet\r\nthought less of producing living beings than of scotching a vice; the\r\nscenes get arranged, or are confused together in a mechanical manner; we\r\nsee the process, we feel the satirical intention throughout; delicate\r\nand easy-flowing imitation is absent, as well as the graceful fancy\r\nwhich abounds in Shakespeare. But if Jonson comes across harsh passions,\r\nvisibly evil and vile, he will derive from his energy and wrath the\r\ntalent to render them odious and visible, and will produce a \"Volpone,\"\r\na sublime work, the sharpest picture of the manners of the age, in which\r\nis displayed the full brightness of evil lusts, in which lewdness,\r\ncruelty, love of gold, shamelessness of vice, display a sinister yet\r\nsplendid poetry, worthy of one of Titian's bacchanals.[548] All this\r\nmakes itself apparent in the first scene, when Volpone says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good morning to the day; and next, my gold!----\r\nOpen the shrine, that I may see my saint.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis saint is his piles of gold, jewels, precious plate:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hail the world's soul, and mine!... O thou son of Sol,\r\nBut brighter than thy father, let me kiss,\r\nWith adoration, thee, and every relick\r\nOf sacred treasure in this blessed room.\"[549]\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently after, the dwarf, the eunuch, and the hermaphrodite of the\r\nhouse sing a sort of pagan and fantastic interlude; they chant in\r\nstrange verses the metamorphoses of the hermaphrodite, who was first the\r\nsoul of Pythagoras. We are at Venice, in the palace of the magnifico\r\nVolpone. These deformed creatures, the splendor of gold, this strange\r\nand poetical buffoonery, carry the thought immediately to the sensual\r\ncity, queen of vices and of arts.\r\n\r\nThe rich Volpone lives like an ancient Greek or Roman. Childless and\r\nwithout relatives, playing the invalid, he makes all his flatterers hope\r\nto be his heir, receives their gifts,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Letting the cherry knock against their lips,\r\nAnd draw it by their mouths, and back again.\"[550]\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad to have their gold, but still more glad to deceive them, artistic\r\nin wickedness as in avarice, and just as pleased to look at a contortion\r\nof suffering as at the sparkle of a ruby.\r\n\r\nThe advocate Voltore arrives, bearing a \"huge piece of plate.\" Volpone\r\nthrows himself on his bed, wraps himself in furs, heaps up his pillows,\r\nand coughs as if at the point of death:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Volpone._ I thank you, signior Voltore,\r\nWhere is the plate? mine eyes are bad.... Your love\r\nHath taste in this, and shall not be unanswer'd....\r\nI cannot now last long.... I fell me going--\r\nUh, uh, uh, uh!\"[551]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe closes his eyes, as though exhausted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Voltore._ Am I inscrib'd his heir for certain?\r\n_Mosca_ (_Volpone's Parasite_).\tAre you!\r\nI do beseech you, sir, you will vouchsafe\r\nTo write me in your family. All my hopes\r\nDepend upon your worship: I am lost,\r\nExcept the rising sun do shine on me.\r\n_Volt._ It shall both shine and warm thee, Mosca.\r\n_M._ Sir,\r\nI am man, that hath not done your love\r\nAll the worst offices: here I wear your keys,\r\nSee all your coffers and your caskets lock'd,\r\nKeep the poor inventory of your jewels,\r\nYour plate and monies; am your steward, sir,\r\nHusband your goods here.\r\n_Volt._ But am I sole heir?\r\n_M._ Without a partner, sir; confirm'd this morning\r\nThe wax is warm yet, and the ink scarce dry\r\nUpon the parchment.\r\n_Volt._ Happy, happy me!\r\nBy what good chance, sweet Mosca?\r\n_M._ Your desert, sir;\r\nI know no second cause.\"[552]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he details the abundance of the wealth in which Voltore is about to\r\nrevel, the gold which is to pour upon him, the opulence which is to flow\r\nin his house as a river:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When will you have your inventory brought, sir?\r\nOr see a copy of the will?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imagination is fed with precise words, precise details. Thus, one\r\nafter another, the would-be heirs come like beasts of prey. The second\r\nwho arrives is an old miser, Corbaccio, deaf, \"impotent,\" almost dying,\r\nwho, nevertheless, hopes to survive Volpone. To make more sure of it, he\r\nwould fain have Mosca give his master a narcotic. He has it about him,\r\nthis excellent opiate: he has had it prepared under his own eyes, he\r\nsuggests it. His joy on finding Volpone more ill than himself is\r\nbitterly humorous:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Corbaccio._ How does your patron?...\r\n_Mosca._ His mouth\r\nIs ever gaping, and his eyelids hang.\r\n_C._ Good.\r\n_M._ A freezing numbness stiffens all his joints,\r\nAnd makes the color of his flesh like lead.\r\n_C._ 'Tis good.\r\n_M._ His pulse beats slow, and dull.\r\n_C._ Good symptoms still.\r\n_M._ And from his brain--\r\n_C._ I conceive you; good.\r\n_M._ Flows a cold sweat, with a continual rheum,\r\nForth the resolved corners of his eyes.\r\n_C._ Is't possible? Yet I am better, ha!\r\nHow does he, with the swimming of his head?\r\n_M._ O, sir, 'tis past the scotomy; he now\r\nHath lost his feeling, and hath left to snort:\r\nYou hardly can perceive him, that he breathes.\r\n_C._ Excellent, excellent! sure I shall outlast him:\r\nThis makes me young again, a score of years.\"[553]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would be his heir, says Mosca, the moment is favorable, but you\r\nmust not let yourself be forestalled. Voltore has been here, and\r\npresented him with this piece of plate:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_C._ See, Mosca, look,\r\nHere, I have brought a bag of bright chequines.\r\nWill quite weigh down his plate....\r\n_M._ Now, would I counsel you, make home with speed;\r\nThere, frame a will; whereto you shall inscribe\r\nMy master your sole heir....\r\n_C._ This plot\r\nDid I think on before....\r\n_M._ And you so certain to survive him--\r\n_C._ Ay.\r\n_M._ Being so lusty a man--\r\n_C._ 'Tis true.\"[554]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the old man hobbles away, not hearing the insults and ridicule\r\nthrown at him, he is so deaf.\r\n\r\nWhen he is gone the merchant Corvino arrives, bringing an orient pearl\r\nand a splendid diamond:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Corvino._ Am I his heir?\r\n_Mosca._ Sir, I am sworn, I may not show the will\r\nTill he be dead; but here has been Corbaccio,\r\nHere has been Voltore, here were others too,\r\nI cannot number 'em, they were so many;\r\nAll gaping here for legacies: but I,\r\nTaking the vantage of his naming you,\r\n_Signior Corvino, Signior Corvino_, took\r\nPaper, and pen, and ink, and there I asked him,\r\nWhom he would have his heir? Corvino. Who\r\nShould be executor? Corvino. And,\r\nTo any question he was silent to,\r\nI still interpreted the nods he made,\r\nThrough weakness, for consent: and sent home th' others,\r\nNothing bequeath'd them, but to cry and curse.\r\n_Cor._ O my dear Mosca!... Has he children?\r\n_M._ Bastards,\r\nSome dozen, or more, that he begot on beggars,\r\nGypsies, and Jews, and black-moors, when he was drunk....\r\nSpeak out:\r\nYou may be louder yet....\r\nFaith, I could stifle him rarely with a pillow,\r\nAs well as any woman that should keep him.\r\n_C._ Do as you will; but I'll begone.\"[555]\r\n\r\n\r\nCorvino presently departs; for the passions of the time have all the\r\nbeauty of frankness. And Volpone, casting aside his sick man's garb,\r\ncries:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My divine Mosca!\r\nThou hast to-day out gone thyself.... Prepare\r\nMe music, dances, banquets, all delights;\r\nThe Turk is not more sensual in his pleasures,\r\nThan will Volpone.\"[556]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this invitation, Mosca draws a most voluptuous portrait of Corvino's\r\nwife, Celia. Smitten with a sudden desire, Volpone dresses himself as a\r\nmountebank, and goes singing under her windows with all the\r\nsprightliness of a quack; for he is naturally a comedian, like a true\r\nItalian, of the same family as Scaramouch, as good an actor in the\r\npublic square as in his house. Having once seen Celia, he resolves to\r\nobtain her at any price:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mosca, take my keys,\r\nGold, plate, and jewels, all's at thy devotion;\r\nEmploy them how thou wilt; nay, coin me too:\r\nSo thou, in this, but crown my longings, Mosca.\"[557]\r\n\r\n\r\nMosca then tells Corvino that some quack's oil has cured his master, and\r\nthat they are looking for a \"young woman, lusty and full of juice,\" to\r\ncomplete the cure:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have you no kinswoman?\r\nOdso--Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, sir.\r\nOne o' the doctors offer'd there his daughter.\r\n_Corvino._ How!\r\n_Mosca._ Yes, signior Lupo, the physician.\r\n_C._ His daughter!\r\n_M._ And a virgin, sir....\r\n_C._ Wretch!\r\nCovetous wretch.\"[558]\r\n\r\n\r\nThough unreasonably jealous, Corvino is gradually induced to offer his\r\nwife. He has given too much already, and would not lose his advantage.\r\nHe is like a half-ruined gamester, who with a shaking hand throws on the\r\ngreen cloth the remainder of his fortune. He brings the poor sweet\r\nwoman, weeping and resisting. Excited by his own hidden pangs, he\r\nbecomes furious:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Be damn'd!\r\nHeart, I will drag thee hence, home, by the hair;\r\nCry thee a strumpet through the streets; rip up\r\nThy mouth unto thine ears; and slit thy nose;\r\nLike a raw rochet!--Do not tempt me; come,\r\nYield, I am loth--Death! I will buy some slave\r\nWhom I will kill, and bind thee to him, alive;\r\nAnd at my window hang you forth, devising\r\nSome monstrous crime, which I, in capital letters,\r\nWill eat into thy flesh with aquafortis,\r\nAnd burning corsives, on this stubborn breast.\r\nNow, by the blood thou hast incensed, I'll do it!\r\n_Celia._ Sir, what you please, you may, I am your martyr.\r\n_Corvino._ Be not thus obstinate, I have not deserv'd it:\r\nThink who it is intreats you. Prithee, sweet;--\r\nGood faith thou shalt have jewels, gowns, attires,\r\nWhat thou wilt think, and ask. Do but go kiss him,\r\nOr touch him, but. For my sake.--At my suit.--\r\nThis once.--No! not! I shall remember this.\r\nWill you disgrace me thus? Do you thirst my undoing?\"[559]\r\n\r\n\r\nMosca turned a moment before, to Volpone:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\nSignior Corvino... hearing of the consultation had\r\nSo lately, for your health, is come to offer,\r\nOr rather, sir, to prostitute.--\r\n_Corvino._ Thanks, sweet Mosca.\r\n_Mosca._ Freely, unask'd, or unintreated.\r\n_C._ Well.\r\n_Mosca._ As the true fervent instance of his love,\r\nHis own most fair and proper wife; the beauty\r\nOnly of price in Venice.--\r\n_C._ 'Tis well urg'd.\"[560]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere can we see such blows launched and driven hard, full in the face,\r\nby the violent hand of satire? Celia is alone with Volpone, who,\r\nthrowing off his feigned sickness, comes upon her \"as fresh, as hot, as\r\nhigh, and in as jovial plight,\" as on the gala days of the Republic,\r\nwhen he acted the part of the lovely Antinous. In his transport he sings\r\na love-song; his voluptuousness culminates in poetry; for poetry was\r\nthen in Italy the blossom of vice. He spreads before her pearls,\r\ndiamonds, carbuncles. He is in raptures at the sight of the treasures,\r\nwhich he displays and sparkles before her eyes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Take these,\r\nAnd wear, and lose them: yet remains an ear-ring\r\nTo purchase them again, and this whole state.\r\nA gem but worth a private patrimony,\r\nIs nothing: we will eat such at a meal,\r\nThe heads of parrots, tongues of nightingales,\r\nThe brains of peacocks, and of estriches,\r\nShall be our food....\r\nConscience? 'Tis the beggar's virtue....\r\nThy baths shall be of the juice of July flowers,\r\nSpirit of roses, and of violets,\r\nThe milk of unicorns, and panthers' breath\r\nGather'd in bags, and mixt with Cretan wines.\r\nOur drink shall be prepared gold and amber;\r\nWhich we will take, until my roof whirl round\r\nWith the vertigo: and my dwarf shall dance,\r\nMy eunuch sing, my fool make up the antic,\r\nWhilst we, in changed shapes, act Ovid's tales,\r\nThou, like Europa now, and I like Jove,\r\nThen I like Mars, and thou like Erycine;\r\nSo, of the rest, till we have quite run through,\r\nAnd wearied all the fables of the gods.\"[561]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recognize Venice in this splendor of debauchery--Venice, the throne\r\nof Aretinus, the country of Tintoretto and Giorgione. Volpone seizes\r\nCelia: \"Yield, or I'll force thee!\" But suddenly Bonario, disinherited\r\nson of Corbaccio, whom Mosca had concealed there with another design,\r\nenters violently, delivers her, wounds Mosca, and accuses Volpone before\r\nthe tribunal, of imposture and rape.\r\n\r\nThe three rascals who aim at being his heirs, work together to save\r\nVolpone. Corbaccio disavows his son, and accuses him of parricide.\r\nCorvino declares his wife an adulteress, the shameless mistress of\r\nBonario. Never on the stage was seen such energy of lying, such open\r\nvillany. The husband, who knows his wife to be innocent, is the most\r\neager:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This woman (please your fatherhoods) is a whore,\r\nOf most hot exercise, more than a partrich,\r\nUpon record.\r\n_1st Advocate._ No more.\r\n_Corvino._ Neighs like a jennet.\r\n_Notary._ Preserve the honor of the court.\r\n_C._ I shall,\r\nAnd modesty of your most reverend ears.\r\nAnd yet I hope that I may say, these eyes\r\nHave seen her glued unto that piece of cedar,\r\nThat fine well-timber'd gallant; and that here\r\nThe letters may be read, thorough the horn,\r\nThat make the story perfect....\r\n_3d Adv._ His grief hath made him frantic. (_Celia swoons._)\r\n_C._ Rare! Prettily feign'd! again!\"[562]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have Volpone brought in, like a dying man; manufacture false\r\n\"testimony,\" to which Voltore gives weight with his advocate's tongue,\r\nwith words worth a sequin apiece. They throw Celia and Bonario into\r\nprison, and Volpone is saved. This public imposture is for him only\r\nanother comedy, a pleasant pastime, and a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Mosca._ To gull the court.\r\n_Volpone._ And quite divert the torrent\r\nUpon the innocent....\r\n_M._ You are not taken with it enough, methinks.\r\n_V._ O, more than if I had enjoy'd the wench?\"[563]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude, he writes a will in Mosca's favor, has his death reported,\r\nhides behind a curtain, and enjoys the looks of the would-be heirs. They\r\nhad just saved him from being thrown into prison, which makes the fun\r\nall the better; the wickedness will be all the greater and more\r\nexquisite. \"Torture 'em rarely,\" Volpone says to Mosca. The latter\r\nspreads the will on the table, and reads the inventory aloud. \"Turkey\r\ncarpets nine. Two cabinets, one of ebony, the other mother-of-pearl. A\r\nperfum'd box, made of an onyx.\" The heirs are stupefied with\r\ndisappointment, and Mosca drives them off with insults. He says to\r\nCorvino:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should you stay here? with what thought, what promise?\r\nHear you; do you not know, I know you an ass,\r\nAnd that you would most fain have been a wittol,\r\nIf fortune would have let you? That you are\r\nA declar'd cuckold, on good terms? This pearl,\r\nYou'll say, was yours? Right: this diamond?\r\nI'll not deny't, but thank you. Much here else?\r\nIt may be so. Why, think that these good works\r\nMay help to hide your bad. [_Exit Corvino._]...\r\n_Corbaccio._ I am cozen'd, cheated, by a parasite slave;\r\nHarlot, thou hast gull'd me.\r\n_Mosca._ Yes, sir. Stop your mouth,\r\nOr I shall draw the only tooth is left.\r\nAre not you he, that filthy covetous wretch,\r\nWith the three legs, that here, in hope of prey,\r\nHave, any time this three years, snufft about,\r\nWith your most grov'ling nose, and would have hir'd\r\nMe to the pois'ning of my patron, sir?\r\nAre not you he that have to-day in court\r\nProfess'd the disinheriting of your son?\r\nPerjur'd yourself? Go home, and die, and stink.\"[564]\r\n\r\n\r\nVolpone goes out disguised, comes to each of them in turn, and succeeds\r\nin wringing their hearts. But Mosca, who has the will, acts with a high\r\nhand, and demands of Volpone half his fortune. The dispute between the\r\ntwo rascals discovers their impostures, and the master, the servant,\r\nwith the three would-be heirs, are sent to the galleys, to prison, to\r\nthe pillory--as Corvino says, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have mine eyes beat out with stinking fish,\r\nBruis'd fruit, and rotten eggs.--'Tis well. I'm glad,\r\nI shall not see my shame yet.\"[565]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more vengeful comedy has been written, none more persistently athirst\r\nto make vice suffer, to unmask, triumph over, and to punish it.\r\n\r\nWhere can be the gayety of such a theatre? In caricature and farce.\r\nThere is a rough gayety, a sort of physical, external laughter which\r\nsuits this combative, drinking, blustering mood. It is thus that this\r\nmood relaxes from war-waging and murderous satire; the pastime is\r\nappropriate to the manners of the time, excellent to attract men who\r\nlook upon hanging as a good joke, and laugh to see the Puritan's ears\r\ncut. Put yourself for an instant in their place, and you will think like\r\nthem, that \"The Silent Woman\" is a masterpiece. Morose is an old\r\nmonomaniac, who has a horror of noise, but loves to speak. He inhabits a\r\nstreet so narrow that a carriage cannot enter it. He drives off with his\r\nstick the bear-leaders and sword-players, who venture to pass under his\r\nwindows. He has sent away his servant whose shoes creaked; and Mute, the\r\nnew one, wears slippers \"soled with wool,\" and only speaks in a whisper\r\nthrough a tube. Morose ends by forbidding the whisper, and makes him\r\nreply by signs. He is also rich, an uncle, and he ill-treats his nephew\r\nSir Dauphine Eugenie, a man of wit, but who lacks money. We anticipate\r\nall the tortures which poor Morose is to suffer. Sir Dauphine finds him\r\na supposed silent woman, the beautiful Epicœne. Morose, enchanted by\r\nher brief replies and her voice, which he can hardly hear, marries her,\r\nto play his nephew a trick. It is his nephew who has played him a trick.\r\nAs soon as she is married, Epicœne speaks, scolds, argues as loud and\r\nas long as a dozen women: \"Why, did you think you had married a statue?\r\nor a motion only? one of the French puppets, with the eyes turned with a\r\nwire? or some innocent out of the hospital, that would stand with her\r\nhands thus, and a plaise mouth, and look upon you?\"[566]\r\n\r\nShe orders the servants to speak louder; she opens the doors wide to her\r\nfriends. They arrive in shoals, offering their noisy congratulations to\r\nMorose. Five or six women's tongues overwhelm him all at once with\r\ncompliments, questions, advice, remonstrances. A friend of Sir Dauphine\r\ncomes with a band of music, who play all together, suddenly, with their\r\nwhole force. Morose says, \"O, a plot, a plot, a plot, a plot, upon me!\r\nThis day I shall be their anvil to work on; they will grate me asunder.\r\n'Tis worse than the noise of a saw.\"[567] A procession of servants is\r\nseen coming, with dishes in their hands; it is the racket of a tavern\r\nwhich Sir Dauphine is bringing to his uncle. The guests clash the\r\nglasses, shout, drink healths; they have with them a drum and trumpets\r\nwhich make great noise. Morose flees to the top of the house, puts \"a\r\nwhole nest of night-caps\" on his head and stuffs up his ears. Captain\r\nOtter cries, \"Sound, Tritons o' the Thames! _Nunc est bibendum, nunc\r\npede libero._ Villains, murderers, sons of the earth and traitors,\"\r\ncries Morose from above, \"what do you there?\" The racket increases. Then\r\nthe captain, somewhat \"jovial,\" maligns his wife, who falls upon him and\r\ngives him a good beating. Blows, cries, music, laughter, resound like\r\nthunder. It is the poetry of uproar. Here is a subject to shake coarse\r\nnerves, and to make the mighty chests of the companions of Drake and\r\nEssex shake with uncontrollable laughter. \"Rogues, hell-hounds,\r\nStentors! ... They have rent my roof, walls, and all my windows asunder,\r\nwith their brazen throats!\" Morose casts himself on his tormentors with\r\nhis long sword, breaks the instruments, drives away the musicians,\r\ndisperses the guests amidst an inexpressible uproar, gnashing his teeth,\r\nlooking haggard. Afterwards they pronounce him mad and discuss his\r\nmadness before him.[568] The disease in Greek is called _μανία_, in\r\nLatin _insania, furor, vel ecstasis melancholica_; that is, _egressio_,\r\nwhen a man _ex melancholico evadit fanaticus._... But he may be but\r\nphreneticus yet, mistress; and phrenetis is only delirium, or so. They\r\ntalk of the books which he must read aloud to cure him. They add, by way\r\nof consolation, that his wife talks in her sleep, \"and snores like a\r\nporpoise. O redeem me, fate; redeem me, fate!\" cries the poor\r\nman.[569] \"For how many causes may a man be divorced, nephew?\" Sir\r\nDauphine chooses two knaves, and disguises them, one as a priest, the\r\nother as a lawyer, who launch at his head Latin terms of civil and canon\r\nlaw, explain to Morose the twelve cases of nullity, jingle in his ears\r\none after another the most barbarous words in their obscure vocabulary,\r\nwrangle, and make between them as much noise as a couple of bells in a\r\nbelfry. Following their advice, he declares himself impotent. The\r\nwedding-guests propose to toss him in a blanket; others demand an\r\nimmediate inspection. Fall after fall, shame after shame; nothing serves\r\nhim: his wife declares that she consents to \"take him with all his\r\nfaults.\" The lawyer proposes another legal method; Morose shall obtain a\r\ndivorce by proving that his wife is faithless. Two boasting knights, who\r\nare present, declare that they have been her lovers. Morose, in\r\nraptures, throws himself at their knees, and embraces them. Epicœne\r\nweeps, and Morose seems to be delivered. Suddenly the lawyer decides\r\nthat the plan is of no avail, the infidelity having been committed\r\nbefore the marriage. \"O, this is worst of all worst worsts that hell\r\ncould have devis'd! marry a whore, and so much noise!\" There is Morose\r\nthen, declared impotent and a deceived husband, at his own request, in\r\nthe eyes of the whole world, and moreover married forever. Sir Dauphine\r\ncomes in like a clever rascal, and as a succoring deity. \"Allow me but\r\nfive hundred during life, uncle, and I free you.\" Morose signs the deed\r\nof gift with alacrity; and his nephew shows him that Epicœne is a boy\r\nin disguise.[570] Add to this enchanting farce the funny parts of the\r\ntwo accomplished and gallant knights, who, after having boasted of their\r\nbravery, receive gratefully, and before the ladies, flips and\r\nkicks.[571] Never was coarse physical laughter more adroitly produced.\r\nIn this broad coarse gayety, this excess of noisy transport, you\r\nrecognize the stout roisterer, the stalwart drinker who swallowed\r\nhogsheads of Canary, and made the windows of the Mermaid shake with his\r\nbursts of humor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--Limits of Jonson's Talent--His Smaller Poems--His Masques\r\n\r\n\r\nJonson did not go beyond this; he was not a philosopher like Molière,\r\nable to grasp and dramatize the crisis of human life, education,\r\nmarriage, sickness, the chief characters of his country and century, the\r\ncourtier, the tradesman, the hypocrite, the man of the world.[572] He\r\nremained on a lower level, in the comedy of plot,[573] the painting of\r\nthe grotesque,[574] the representation of too transient subjects of\r\nridicule,[575] too general vices.[576] If at times, as in the\r\n\"Alchemist,\" he has succeeded by the perfection of plot and the vigor of\r\nsatire, he has miscarried more frequently by the ponderousness of his\r\nwork and the lack of comic lightness. The critic in him mars the artist;\r\nhis literary calculations strip him of spontaneous invention; he is too\r\nmuch of a writer and moralist, not enough of a mimic and an actor. But\r\nhe is loftier from another side, for he is a poet; almost all writers,\r\nprose-authors, preachers even, were so at the time we speak of. Fancy\r\nabounded, as well as the perception of colors and forms, the need and\r\nwont of enjoying through the imagination and the eyes. Many of Jonson's\r\npieces, the \"Staple of News, Cynthia's Revels,\" are fanciful and\r\nallegorical comedies like those of Aristophanes. He there dallies with\r\nthe real, and beyond the real, with characters who are but theatrical\r\nmasks, abstractions personified, buffooneries, decorations, dances,\r\nmusic, pretty laughing whims of a picturesque and sentimental\r\nimagination. Thus, in \"Cynthia's Revels,\" three children come on\r\n\"pleading possession of the cloke\" of black velvet, which an actor\r\nusually wore when he spoke the prologue. They draw lots for it; one of\r\nthe losers, in revenge, tells the audience beforehand the incidents of\r\nthe piece. The others interrupt him at every sentence, put their hands\r\non his mouth, and taking the cloak one after the other, begin to\r\ncriticise the spectators and authors. This child's play, these gestures\r\nand loud voices, this little amusing dispute, divert the public from\r\ntheir serious thoughts, and prepare them for the oddities which they are\r\nto look upon.\r\n\r\nWe are in Greece, in the valley of Gargaphie, where Diana[577] has\r\nproclaimed \"a solemn revels.\" Mercury and Cupid have come down, and\r\nbegin by quarrelling; the latter says: \"My light feather-heel'd coz,\r\nwhat are you any more than my uncle Jove's pander? a lacquey that runs\r\non errands for him, and can whisper a light message to a loose wench\r\nwith some round volubility?... One that sweeps the gods' drinking-room\r\nevery morning, and sets the cushions in order again, which they threw\r\none at another's head over night?\"[578]\r\n\r\nThey are good-tempered gods. Echo, awoke by Mercury, weeps for the \"too\r\nbeauteous boy Narcissus\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That trophy of self-love, and spoil of nature,\r\nWho, now transformed into this drooping flower,\r\nHangs the repentant head, back from the stream....\r\nWitness thy youth's dear sweets, here spent untasted,\r\nLike a fair taper, with his own flame wasted!...\r\nAnd with thy water let this curse remain,\r\nAs an inseparate plague, that who but taste\r\nA drop thereof, may, with the instant touch,\r\nGrow doatingly enamour'd on themselves.\"[579]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe courtiers and ladies drink thereof, and behold, a sort of a review\r\nof the follies of the time, arranged, as in Aristophanes, in an\r\nimprobable farce, a brilliant show. A silly spendthrift, Asotus, wishes\r\nto become a man of the court and of fashionable manners; he takes for\r\nhis master Amorphus, a learned traveller, expert in gallantry, who, to\r\nbelieve himself, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An essence so sublimated and refined by travel... able... to speak the\r\nmere extraction of language; one that... was your first that ever\r\nenrich'd his country with the true laws of the duello; whose optics have\r\ndrunk the spirit of beauty in some eight-score and eighteen princes'\r\ncourts, where I have resided, and been there fortunate in the amours of\r\nthree hundred forty and five ladies, all nobly if not princely\r\ndescended,... in all so happy, as even admiration herself doth seem to\r\nfasten her kisses upon me.\"[580]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsotus learns at this good school the language of the court, fortifies\r\nhimself like other people with quibbles, learned oaths, and metaphors;\r\nhe fires off in succession supersubtle tirades, and duly imitates the\r\ngrimaces and tortuous style of his masters. Then, when he has drunk the\r\nwater of the fountain, becoming suddenly pert and rash, he proposes to\r\nall comers a tournament of \"court compliment.\" This odd tournament is\r\nheld before the ladies; it comprises four jousts, and at each the\r\ntrumpets sound. The combatants perform in succession \"the _bare\r\naccost_; the _better regard_; the _solemn address_;\" and \"the perfect\r\nclose.\"[581] In this grave buffoonery the courtiers are beaten. The\r\nsevere Crites, the moralist of the play, copies their language, and\r\npierces them with their own weapons. Already, with grand declamation, he\r\nhad rebuked them thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O vanity,\r\nHow are thy painted beauties doated on,\r\nBy light, and empty idiots! how pursu'd\r\nWith open and extended appetite!\r\nHow they do sweat, and run themselves from breath,\r\nRais'd on their toes, to catch thy airy forms,\r\nStill turning giddy, till they reel like drunkards,\r\nThat buy the merry madness of one hour,\r\nWith the long irksomeness of following time!\"[582]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo complete the overthrow of the vices, appear two symbolical masques,\r\nrepresenting the contrary virtues. They pass gravely before the\r\nspectators, in splendid array, and the noble verses exchanged by the\r\ngoddess and her companions raise the mind to the lofty regions of serene\r\nmorality, whither the poet desires to carry us:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Queen, and huntress, chaste and fair,\r\nNow the sun is laid to sleep,\r\nSeated in thy silver chair,\r\nState in wonted manner keep....\r\nLay thy bow of pearl apart,\r\nAnd thy crystal shining quiver;\r\nGive unto the flying hart\r\nSpace to breathe, how short soever.\"[583]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, bidding the dancers to unmask, Cynthia shows that the vices\r\nhave disguised themselves as virtues. She condemns them to make fit\r\nreparation, and to bathe themselves in Helicon. Two by two they go off\r\nsinging a palinode, whilst the chorus sings the supplication \"Good\r\nMercury defend us.\"[584] Is it an opera or a comedy? It is a lyrical\r\ncomedy; and if we do not discover in it the airy lightness of\r\nAristophanes, at least we encounter, as in the \"Birds\" and the \"Frogs,\"\r\nthe contrasts and medleys of poetic invention, which, through caricature\r\nand ode, the real and the impossible, the present and the past, sent\r\nforth to the four quarters of the globe, simultaneously unites all kinds\r\nof incompatibilities, and culls all flowers.\r\n\r\nJonson went further than this, and entered the domain of pure poetry. He\r\nwrote delicate, voluptuous, charming love poems, worthy of the ancient\r\nidyllic muse.[585] Above all, he was the great, the inexhaustible\r\ninventor of Masques, a kind of masquerades, ballets, poetic choruses, in\r\nwhich all the magnificence and the imagination of the English\r\nRenaissance is displayed. The Greek gods, and all the ancient Olympus,\r\nthe allegorical personages whom the artists of the time delineate in\r\ntheir pictures; the antique heroes of popular legends; all worlds, the\r\nactual, the abstract, the divine, the human, the ancient, the modern,\r\nare searched by his hands, brought on the stage to furnish costumes,\r\nharmonious groups, emblems, songs, whatever can excite, intoxicate the\r\nartistic sense. The _élite_, moreover, of the kingdom is there on the\r\nstage. They are not mountebanks moving about in borrowed clothes,\r\nclumsily worn, for which they are still in debt to the tailor; they are\r\nladies of the court, great lords, the queen, in all the splendor of\r\ntheir rank and pride, with real diamonds, bent on displaying their\r\nriches, so that the whole splendor of the national life is concentrated\r\nin the opera which they enact, like jewels in a casket. What dresses!\r\nwhat profusion of splendors! what medley of strange characters, gipsies,\r\nwitches, gods, heroes, pontiffs, gnomes, fantastic beings! How many\r\nmetamorphoses, jousts, dances, marriage songs! What variety of scenery,\r\narchitecture, floating isles, triumphal arches, symbolic spheres! Gold\r\nglitters; jewels flash; purple absorbs the lustre-lights in its costly\r\nfolds; streams of light shine upon the crumpled silks; diamond\r\nnecklaces, darting flame, clasp the bare bosoms of the ladies; strings\r\nof pearls are displayed, loop after loop, upon the silver-sown brocaded\r\ndresses; gold embroidery, weaving whimsical arabesques, depicts upon\r\ntheir dresses flowers, fruits, and figures, setting picture within\r\npicture. The steps of the throne bear groups of Cupids, each with a\r\ntorch in his hand.[586] On either side the fountains cast up plumes of\r\npearls; musicians, in purple and scarlet, laurel-crowned, make harmony\r\nin the bowers. The trains of masques cross, commingling their groups;\r\n\"the one half in orange-tawny and silver, the other in sea-green and\r\nsilver. The bodies and short skirts (were of) white and gold to both.\"\r\n\r\nSuch pageants Jonson wrote year after year, almost to the end of his\r\nlife, true feasts for the eyes, like the processions of Titian. Even\r\nwhen he grew to be old, his imagination, like that of Titian, remained\r\nabundant and fresh. Though forsaken, lying gasping on his bed, feeling\r\nthe approach of death, in his supreme bitterness he did not lose his\r\nfaculties, but wrote \"The Sad Shepherd,\" the most graceful and pastoral\r\nof his pieces. Consider that this beautiful dream arose in a\r\nsick-chamber, amidst medicine bottles, physic, doctors, with a nurse at\r\nhis side, amidst the anxieties of poverty and the choking-fits of a\r\ndropsy! He is transported to a green forest, in the days of Robin Hood,\r\namidst the gay chase and the great barking greyhounds. There are the\r\nmalicious fairies, who, like Oberon and Titania, lead men to flounder in\r\nmishaps. There are open-souled lovers, who, like Daphne and Chloe, taste\r\nwith awe the painful sweetness of the first kiss. There lived Earine,\r\nwhom the stream has \"suck'd in,\" whom her lover, in his madness, will\r\nnot cease to lament:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Earine,\r\nWho had her very being, and her name\r\nWith the first knots or buddings of the spring,\r\nBorn with the primrose or the violet,\r\nOr earliest roses blown: when Cupid smil'd,\r\nAnd Venus led the graces out to dance,\r\nAnd all the flowers and sweets in nature's lap\r\nLeap'd out, and made their solemn conjuration\r\nTo last but while she liv'd!\"...[587]\r\n\"But she, as chaste as was her name, Earine,\r\nDied undeflower'd: and now her sweet soul hovers\r\nHere in the air above us.\"[588]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove the poor old paralytic artist, poetry still hovers like a haze of\r\nlight. Yes, he had cumbered himself with science, clogged himself with\r\ntheories, constituted himself theatrical critic and social censor,\r\nfilled his soul with unrelenting indignation, fostered a combative and\r\nmorose disposition; but divine dreams never left him. He is the brother\r\nof Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--General Idea of Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now at last we are in the presence of one, whom we perceived before\r\nus through all the vistas of the Renaissance, like some vast oak to\r\nwhich all the forest ways converge. I will treat of Shapespeare by\r\nhimself. In order to take him in completely, we must have a wide and\r\nopen space. And yet how shall we comprehend him? how lay bare his inner\r\nconstitution? Lofty words, eulogies, are all used in vain; he needs no\r\npraise, but comprehension merely; and he can only be comprehended by the\r\naid of science. As the complicated revolutions of the heavenly bodies\r\nbecome intelligible only by use of a superior calculus, as the delicate\r\ntransformations of vegetation and life need for their explanation the\r\nintervention of the most difficult chemical formulas, so the great works\r\nof art can be interpreted only by the most advanced psychological\r\nsystems; and we need the loftiest of all these to attain to\r\nShakespeare's level--to the level of his age and his work, of his genius\r\nand of his art.\r\n\r\nAfter all practical experience and accumulated observations of the soul,\r\nwe find as the result that wisdom and knowledge are in man only effects\r\nand fortuities. Man has no permanent and distinct force to secure truth\r\nto his intelligence, and common-sense to his conduct. On the contrary,\r\nhe is naturally unreasonable and deceived. The parts of his inner\r\nmechanism are like the wheels of clock-work, which go of themselves,\r\nblindly, carried away by impulse and weight, and which yet sometimes, by\r\nvirtue of a certain unison, end by indicating the hour. This final\r\nintelligent motion is not natural, but fortuitous; not spontaneous, but\r\nforced; not innate, but acquired. The clock did not always go regularly;\r\non the contrary, it had to be regulated little by little, with much\r\ndifficulty. Its regularity is not insured; it may go wrong at any time.\r\nIts regularity is not complete; it only approximately marks the time.\r\nThe mechanical force of each piece is always ready to drag all the rest\r\nfrom their proper action, and to disarrange the whole agreement. So\r\nideas, once in the mind, pull each their own way blindly and separately,\r\nand their imperfect agreement threatens confusion every moment. Strictly\r\nspeaking, man is mad, as the body is ill, by nature; reason and health\r\ncome to us as a momentary success, a lucky accident.[589] If we forget\r\nthis, it is because we are now regulated, dulled, deadened, and because\r\nour internal motion has become gradually, by friction and reparation,\r\nhalf harmonized with the motion of things. But this is only a semblance;\r\nand the dangerous primitive forces remain untamed and independent under\r\nthe order which seems to restrain them. Let a great danger arise, a\r\nrevolution take place, they will break out and explode, almost as\r\nterribly as in earlier times. For an idea is not a mere inner mark,\r\nemployed to designate one aspect of things, inert, always ready to fall\r\ninto order with other similar ones, so as to make an exact whole.\r\nHowever it may be reduced and disciplined, it still retains a sensible\r\ntinge which shows its likeness to an hallucination; a degree of\r\nindividual persistence which shows its likeness to a monomania; a\r\nnetwork of singular affinities which shows its likeness to the ravings\r\nof delirium. Being such, it is beyond question the rudiment of a\r\nnightmare, a habit, an absurdity. Let it become once developed in its\r\nentirety, as its tendency leads it,[590] and you will find that it is\r\nessentially an active and complete image, a vision drawing along with it\r\na train of dreams and sensations, which increases of itself, suddenly,\r\nby a sort of rank and absorbing growth, and which ends by possessing,\r\nshaking, exhausting the whole man. After this, another, perhaps entirely\r\nopposite, and so on successively: there is nothing else in man, no free\r\nand distinct power: he is in himself but the process of these headlong\r\nimpulses and swarming imaginations: civilization has mutilated,\r\nattenuated, but not destroyed them; shocks, collisions, transports,\r\nsometimes at long intervals a sort of transient partial equilibrium:\r\nthis is his real life, the life of a lunatic, who now and then simulates\r\nreason, but who is in reality \"such stuff as dreams are made on\";[591]\r\nand this is man, as Shakespeare has conceived him. No writer, not even\r\nMolière, has penetrated so far beneath the semblance of common-sense\r\nand logic in which the human machine is enclosed, in order to\r\ndisentangle the brute powers which constitute its substance and its\r\nmainspring.\r\n\r\nHow did Shakespeare succeed? and by what extraordinary instinct did he\r\ndivine the remote conclusions, the deepest insights of physiology and\r\npsychology? He had a complete imagination; his whole genius lies in that\r\ncomplete imagination. These words seem commonplace and void of meaning.\r\nLet us examine them closer, to understand what they contain. When we\r\nthink a thing, we, ordinary men, we only think a part of it; we see one\r\nside, some isolated mark, sometimes two or three marks together; for\r\nwhat is beyond, our sight fails us; the infinite network of its\r\ninfinitely complicated and multiplied properties escapes us; we feel\r\nvaguely that there is something beyond our shallow ken, and this vague\r\nsuspicion is the only part of our idea which at all reveals to us the\r\ngreat beyond. We are like tyro naturalists, quiet people of limited\r\nunderstanding, who, wishing to represent an animal, recall its name and\r\nticket in the museum, with some indistinct image of its hide and figure;\r\nbut their mind stops there. If it so happens that they wish to complete\r\ntheir knowledge, they lead their memory, by regular classifications,\r\nover the principal characters of the animal, and slowly, discursively,\r\npiecemeal, bring at last the bare anatomy before their eyes. To this\r\ntheir idea is reduced, even when perfected; to this also most frequently\r\nis our conception reduced, even when elaborated. What a distance there\r\nis between this conception and the object, how imperfectly and meanly\r\nthe one represents the other, to what extent this mutilates that; how\r\nthe consecutive idea, disjoined in little, regularly arranged and inert\r\nfragments, resembles but slightly the organized, living thing, created\r\nsimultaneously, ever in action, and ever transformed, words cannot\r\nexplain. Picture to yourself, instead of this poor dry idea, propped up\r\nby a miserable mechanical linkwork of thought, the complete idea, that\r\nis, an inner representation, so abundant and full that it exhausts all\r\nthe properties and relations of the object, all its inward and outward\r\naspects; that it exhausts them instantaneously; that it conceives of the\r\nentire animal, its color, the play of the light upon its skin, its form,\r\nthe quivering of its outstretched limbs, the flash of its eyes, and at\r\nthe same time its passion of the moment, its excitement, its dash; and\r\nbeyond this its instincts, their composition, their causes, their\r\nhistory; so that the hundred thousand characteristics which make up its\r\ncondition and its nature find their analogues in the imagination which\r\nconcentrates and reflects them: there you have the artist's conception,\r\nthe poet's--Shakespeare's; so superior to that of the logician, of the\r\nmere savant or man of the world, the only one capable of penetrating to\r\nthe very essence of existences, of extricating the inner from beneath\r\nthe outer man, of feeling through sympathy, and imitating without\r\neffort, the irregular oscillation of human imaginations and impressions,\r\nof reproducing life with its infinite fluctuations, its apparent\r\ncontradictions, its concealed logic; in short, to create as nature\r\ncreates. This is what is done by the other artists of this age; they\r\nhave the same kind of mind, and the same idea of life: you will find in\r\nShakespeare only the same faculties, with a still stronger impulse; the\r\nsame idea, with a still more prominent relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: Fuller's \"Worthies,\" ed.

The young fellow applied\r\nhimself to it as well as he could, not without some scrapes and frolics:\r\nif we are to believe tradition, he was one of the thirsty souls of the\r\nplace, with a mind to support the reputation of his little town in its\r\ndrinking powers. Once, they say, having been beaten at Bideford in one\r\nof these ale-bouts, he returned staggering from the fight, or rather\r\ncould not return, and passed the night with his comrades under an\r\napple-tree by the roadside. Without doubt he had already begun to write\r\nverses, to rove about like a genuine poet, taking part in the noisy\r\nrustic feasts, the gay allegorical pastorals, the rich and bold outbreak\r\nof pagan and poetical life, as it was then to be found in an English\r\nvillage. At all events, he was not a pattern of propriety, and his\r\npassions were as precocious as they were imprudent. While not yet\r\nnineteen years old, he married the daughter of a substantial yeoman,\r\nabout eight years older than himself--and not too soon, as she was about\r\nto become a mother.[594] Other of his outbreaks were no more fortunate.\r\nIt seems that he was fond of poaching, after the manner of the time,\r\nbeing \"much given to all unluckinesse in stealing venison and rabbits,\"\r\nsays the Rev. Richard Davies;[595] \"particularly from Sir Thomas Lucy,\r\nwho had him oft whipt and sometimes imprisoned, and at last made him fly\r\nthe country;... but his revenge was so great, that he is his Justice\r\nClodpate.\" Moreover, about this time Shakespeare's father was in prison,\r\nhis affairs were not prosperous, and he himself had three children,\r\nfollowing one close upon the other; he must live, and life was hardly\r\npossible for him in his native town. He went to London, and took to the\r\nstage: took the lowest parts, was a \"servant\" in the theatre, that is,\r\nan apprentice, or perhaps a supernumerary. They even said that he had\r\nbegun still lower, and that to earn his bread he had held gentlemen's\r\nhorses at the door of the theatre.[596] At all events he tasted misery,\r\nand felt, not in imagination, but in fact, the sharp thorn of care,\r\nhumiliation, disgust, forced labor, public discredit, the power of the\r\npeople. He was a comedian, one of \"His Majesty's poor players\"[597]--a\r\nsad trade, degraded in all ages by the contrasts and the falsehoods\r\nwhich it allows: still more degraded then by the brutalities of the\r\ncrowd, who not seldom would stone the actors, and by the severities of\r\nthe magistrates, who would sometimes condemn them to lose their ears. He\r\nfelt it, and spoke of it with bitterness:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there\r\nAnd made myself a motley to the view,\r\nGored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear.\"[598]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When in disgrace with fortune[599] and men's eyes,\r\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\r\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\r\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\r\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\r\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed....\r\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\r\nYet in those thoughts myself almost despising.\"[600]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall find further on the traces of this long-enduring disgust, in\r\nhis melancholy characters, as where he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\r\nThe pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\r\nThe insolence of office and the spurns\r\nThe patient merit of the unworthy takes,\r\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\r\nWith a bare bodkin?\"[601]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the worst of this undervalued position is, that it eats into the\r\nsoul. In the company of actors we become actors: it is vain to wish to\r\nkeep clean, if you live in a dirty place; it cannot be. No matter if a\r\nman braces himself; necessity drives him into a corner and sullies him.\r\nThe machinery of the decorations, the tawdriness and medley of the\r\ncostumes, the smell of the tallow and the candles, in contrast with the\r\nparade of refinement and loftiness, all the cheats and sordidness of the\r\nrepresentation, the bitter alternative of hissing or applause, the\r\nkeeping of the highest and lowest company, the habit of sporting with\r\nhuman passions, easily unhinge the soul, drive it down the slope of\r\nexcess, tempt it to loose manners, green-room adventures, the loves of\r\nstrolling actresses. Shakespeare escaped them no more than Molière, and\r\ngrieved for it, like Molière:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\r\nThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\r\nThat did not better for my life provide\r\nThan public means which public manners breeds.\"[602]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey used to relate in London how his comrade Burbadge, who played\r\nRichard III, having a rendezvous with the wife of a citizen, Shakespeare\r\nwent before, was well received, and was pleasantly occupied, when\r\nBurbage arrived, to whom he sent the message that William the Conqueror\r\ncame before Richard III.[603] We may take this as an example of the\r\ntricks and somewhat coarse intrigues which are planned, and follow in\r\nquick succession, on this stage. Outside the theatre he lived with\r\nfashionable young nobles, Pembroke, Montgomery, Southampton,[604] and\r\nothers, whose hot and licentious youth gratified his imagination and\r\nsenses by the example of Italian pleasures and elegancies. Add to this\r\nthe rapture and transport of poetical nature, and this kind of afflux,\r\nthis boiling over of all the powers and desires which takes place in\r\nbrains of this kind, when the world for the first time opens before\r\nthem, and you will understand the \"Venus and Adonis, the first heir of\r\nhis invention.\" In fact, it is a first cry, a cry in which the whole man\r\nis displayed. Never was seen a heart so quivering to the touch of\r\nbeauty, of beauty of every kind, so delighted with the freshness and\r\nsplendor of things, so eager and so excited in adoration and enjoyment,\r\nso violently and entirely carried to the very essence of voluptuousness.\r\nHis Venus is unique; no painting of Titian's has a more brilliant and\r\ndelicious coloring;[605] no strumpet-goddess of Tintoretto or Giorgione\r\nis more soft and beautiful:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With blindfold fury she begins to forage,\r\nHer face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil....\r\nAnd glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;\r\nHer lips are conquerors, his lips obey,\r\nPaying what ransom the insulter willeth;\r\nWhose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,\r\nThat she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry.\"[606]\r\n\r\n\"Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,\r\nTires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,\r\nShaking her wings, devouring all in haste,\r\nTill either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;\r\nEven so she kiss'd his brow, his cheek, his chin,\r\nAnd where she ends she doth anew begin.\"[607]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll is taken by storm, the senses first, the eyes dazzled by carnal\r\nbeauty, but the heart also from whence the poetry overflows: the fulness\r\nof youth inundates even inanimate things; the country looks charming\r\namidst the rays of the rising sun, the air, saturated with brightness,\r\nmakes a gala-day:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,\r\nFrom his moist cabinet mounts up on high,\r\nAnd wakes the morning, from whose silver breast\r\nThe sun riseth in his majesty;\r\nWho doth the world so gloriously behold\r\nThat cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.\"[608]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn admirable debauch of imagination and rapture, yet disquieting; for\r\nsuch a mood will carry one a long way.[609] No fair and frail dame in\r\nLondon was without \"Adonis\" on her table.[610] Perhaps Shakespeare\r\nperceived that he had transcended the bounds, for the tone of his next\r\npoem, the \"Rape of Lucrece,\" is quite different; but as he had already a\r\nmind liberal enough to embrace at the same time, as he did afterwards in\r\nhis dramas, the two extremes of things, he continued none the less to\r\nfollow his bent. The \"sweet abandonment of love\" was the great\r\noccupation of his life; he was tender-hearted, and he was a poet:\r\nnothing more is required to be smitten, deceived, to suffer, to traverse\r\nwithout pause the circle of illusions and troubles, which whirls and\r\nwhirls round, and never ends.\r\n\r\nHe had many loves of this kind, amongst others one for a sort of Marion\r\nDelorme,[611] a miserable deluding despotic passion, of which he felt\r\nthe burden and the shame, but from which nevertheless he could not and\r\nwould not free himself. Nothing can be sadder than his confessions, or\r\nmark better the madness of love, and the sentiment of human weakness:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When my love swears that she is made of truth,\r\nI do believe her, though I know she lies.\"[612]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo spoke Alceste of Célimène;[613] but what a soiled Célimène is the\r\ncreature before whom Shakespeare kneels, with as much of scorn as of\r\ndesire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those lips of thine,\r\nThat have profaned their scarlet ornaments\r\nAnd seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,\r\nRobb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.\r\nBe it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those\r\nWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee.\"[614]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is plain-speaking and deep shamelessness of soul, such as we find\r\nonly in the stews; and these are the intoxications, the excesses, the\r\ndelirium into which the most refined artists fall, when they resign\r\ntheir own noble hand to these soft, voluptuous, and clinging ones. They\r\nare higher than princes, and they descend to the lowest depths of\r\nsensual passion. Good and evil then lose their names; all things are\r\ninverted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame\r\nWhich, like a canker in the fragrant rose,\r\nDoth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\r\nO, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!\r\nThat tongue that tells the story of thy days,\r\nMaking lascivious comments on thy sport,\r\nCannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;\r\nNaming thy name blesses an ill report.\"[615]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are proofs, the will, reason, honor itself, when the passion is so\r\nabsorbing? What can be said further to a man who answers, \"I know all\r\nthat you are going to say, and what does it all amount to?\" Great loves\r\nare inundations, which drown all repugnance and all delicacy of soul,\r\nall preconceived opinions and all received principles. Thenceforth the\r\nheart is dead to all ordinary pleasures: it can only feel and breathe on\r\none side. Shakespeare envies the keys of the instrument over which his\r\nmistress's fingers run. If he looks at flowers, it is she whom he\r\npictures beyond them; and the extravagant splendors of dazzling poetry\r\nspring up in him repeatedly, as soon as he thinks of those glowing black\r\neyes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From you have I been absent in the spring,\r\nWhen proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim,\r\nHath put a spirit of youth in every thing,\r\nThat heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.\"[616]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe saw none of it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,\r\nNor praise the deep vermilion in the rose.\"[617]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this sweetness of spring was but her perfume and her shade:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The forward violet thus I did chide:\r\n'Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\r\nIf not from my love's breath? The purple pride,\r\nWhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells\r\nIn my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.'\r\nThe lily I condemned for thy hand,\r\nAnd buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:\r\nThe roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\r\nOne blushing shame, another white despair:\r\nA third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both\r\nAnd to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;...\r\nMore flowers I noted, yet I none could see\r\nBut sweet or color it had stol'n from thee.\"[618]\r\n\r\n\r\nPassionate archness, delicious affectations, worthy of Heine and the\r\ncontemporaries of Dante, which tell us of long rapturous dreams\r\nconcentrated on one subject. Under a sway so imperious and sustained,\r\nwhat sentiment could maintain its ground? That of family? He was married\r\nand had children--a family which he went to see \"once a year\"; and it\r\nwas probably on his return from one of these journeys that he used the\r\nwords above quoted. Conscience? \"Love is too young to know what\r\nconscience is.\" Jealousy and anger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For, thou betraying me, I do betray\r\nMy nobler part to my gross body's treason.\"[619]\r\n\r\n\r\nRepulses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He is contented thy poor drudge to be\r\nTo stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.\"[620]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is no longer young; she loves another, a handsome, young,\r\nlight-haired fellow, his own dearest friend, whom he has presented to\r\nher, and whom she wishes to seduce:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Two loves I have of comfort and despair,\r\nWhich like two spirits do suggest me still:\r\nThe better angel is a man right fair,\r\nThe worser spirit a woman color'd ill.\r\nTo win me soon to hell, my female evil\r\nTempteth my better angel from my side.\"[621]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when she has succeeded in this,[622] he dares not confess it to\r\nhimself, but suffers all, like Molière. What wretchedness is there in\r\nthese trifles of every-day life! How man's thoughts instinctively place\r\nby Shakespeare's side the great unhappy French poet (Molière), also a\r\nphilosopher by nature, but more of a professional laugher, a mocker of\r\nold men in love, a bitter railer at deceived husbands, who, after having\r\nplayed in one of his most approved comedies, said aloud to a friend, \"My\r\ndear fellow, I am in despair; my wife does not love me!\" Neither glory,\r\nnor work, nor invention satisfies these vehement souls: love alone can\r\ngratify them, because, with their senses and heart, it contents also\r\ntheir brain; and all the powers of man, imagination like the rest, find\r\nin it their concentration and their employment. \"Love is my sin,\" he\r\nsaid, as did Musset and Heine; and in the Sonnets we find traces of yet\r\nother passions, equally abandoned; one in particular, seemingly for a\r\ngreat lady. The first half of his dramas, \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\"\r\n\"Romeo and Juliet,\" the \"Two Gentlemen of Verona,\" preserve the warm\r\nimprint more completely; and we have only to consider his latest women's\r\ncharacter,[623] to see with what exquisite tenderness, what full\r\nadoration, he loved them to the end.\r\n\r\nIn this is all his genius; his was one of those delicate souls which,\r\nlike a perfect instrument of music, vibrate of themselves at the\r\nslightest touch. This fine sensibility was the first thing observed in\r\nhim. \"My darling Shakespeare, Sweet Swan of Avon\": these words of Ben\r\nJonson only confirm what his contemporaries reiterate. He was\r\naffectionate and kind, \"civil in demeanor, and excellent in the qualitie\r\nhe professes\";[624] if he had the impulse, he had also the effusion of\r\ntrue artists; he was loved, men were delighted in his company; nothing\r\nis more sweet or winning than this charm, this half-feminine abandonment\r\nin a man. His wit in conversation was ready, ingenious, nimble; his\r\ngayety brilliant; his imagination fluent, and so copious, that, as his,\r\nfriends tell us, he never erased what he had written; at least when he\r\nwrote out a scene for the second time, it was the idea which he would\r\nchange, not the words, by an after-glow of poetic thought, not with a\r\npainful tinkering of the verse. All these characteristics are combined\r\ninto a single one: he had a sympathetic genius; I mean that naturally he\r\nknew how to forget himself and become transfused into all the objects\r\nwhich he conceived. Look around you at the great artists of your time,\r\ntry to approach them, to become acquainted with them, to see them as\r\nthey think, and you will observe the full force of this word. By an\r\nextraordinary instinct, they put themselves at once in a position of\r\nexistences; men, animals, flowers, plants, landscapes, whatever the\r\nobjects are, living or not, they feel by intuition the forces and\r\ntendencies which produce the visible external; and their soul,\r\ninfinitely complex, becomes by its ceaseless metamorphoses a sort of\r\nabstract of the universe. This is why they seem to live more than other\r\nmen; they have no need to be taught, they divine. I have seen such a\r\nman, a propos of a piece of armor, a costume, a collection of furniture,\r\nenter into the Middle Ages more fully than three savants together. They\r\nreconstruct, as they build, naturally, surely, by an inspiration which\r\nis a winged chain of reasoning. Shakespeare had only an imperfect\r\neducation, \"small Latin and less Greek,\" barely French and Italian,[625]\r\nnothing else; he had not travelled, he had only read the current\r\nliterature of his day, he had picked up a few law words in the court of\r\nhis little town: reckon up, if you can, all that he knew of man and of\r\nhistory. These men see more objects at a time; they grasp them more\r\nclosely than other men, more quickly and thoroughly; their mind is full,\r\nand runs over. They do not rest in simple reasoning; at every idea their\r\nwhole being, reflections, images, emotions, are set a-quiver. See them\r\nat it; they gesticulate, mimic their thought, brim over with\r\ncomparisons; even in their talk they are imaginative and original, with\r\nfamiliarity and boldness of speech, sometimes happily, always\r\nirregularly, according to the whims and starts of the adventurous\r\nimprovisation. The animation, the brilliancy of their language is\r\nmarvellous; so are their fits, the wide leaps which they couple widely\r\nremoved ideas, annihilating distance, passing from pathos to humor, from\r\nvehemence to gentleness. This extraordinary rapture is the last thing to\r\nquit them. If perchance ideas fail, or if their melancholy is too\r\nviolent, they still speak and produce, even if it be nonsense: they\r\nbecome clowns, though at their own expense, and to their own hurt. I\r\nknow one of these men who will talk nonsense when he thinks he is dying,\r\nor has a mind to kill himself; the inner wheel continues to turn, even\r\nupon nothing, that wheel which man must needs see ever turning, even\r\nthough it tear him as it turns; his buffoonery is an outlet: you will\r\nfind him, this inextinguishable urchin, this ironical puppet, at\r\nOphelia's tomb, at Cleopatra's death-bed, at Juliet's funeral. High or\r\nlow, these men must always be at some extreme. They feel their good and\r\ntheir ill too deeply; they expatiate too abundantly on each condition of\r\ntheir soul, by a sort of involuntary novel. After their traducings and\r\nthe disgusts by which they debase themselves beyond measure they rise\r\nand become exalted in a marvellous fashion, even trembling with pride\r\nand joy. \"Haply,\" says Shakespeare, after one of these dull moods:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,\r\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\r\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate.\"[626]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen all fades away, as in a furnace where a stronger flare than usual\r\nhas left no substance fuel behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That time of year thou mayst in me behold\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\nBare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\nIn me thou see'st the twilight of such day\r\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west,\r\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\r\nDeath's second self, that seals up all in rest....\"[627]\r\n\r\n\"No longer mourn for me when I am dead\r\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\r\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\r\nFrom this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:\r\nNay, if you read this line, remember not\r\nThe hand that writ it; for I love you so.\r\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot\r\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\"[628]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese sudden alternatives of joy and sadness, divine transports and\r\ngrand melancholies, exquisite tenderness and womanly depressions, depict\r\nthe poet, extreme in emotions, ceaselessly troubled with grief or\r\nmerriment, feeling the slightest shock, more strong, more dainty in\r\nenjoyment and suffering than other men, capable of more intense and\r\nsweeter dreams, within whom is stirred an imaginary world of graceful or\r\nterrible beings, all impassioned like their author.\r\n\r\nSuch as I have described him, however, he found his resting-place.\r\nEarly, at least what regards outward appearances, he settled down to an\r\norderly, sensible, almost humdrum existence, engaged in business,\r\nprovident of the future. He remained on the stage for at least seventeen\r\nyears, though taking secondary parts;[629] he sets his wits at the same\r\ntime to the touching up of plays with so much activity, that Greene\r\ncalled him \"an upstart crow beautified with our feathers;... an absolute\r\nJohannes factotum, in his owne conceyte the onely shake-scene in a\r\ncountrey.\"[630] At the age of thirty-three he had amassed money enough\r\nto buy at Stratford a house with two barns and two gardens, and he went\r\non steadier and steadier in the same course. A man attains only to easy\r\ncircumstances by his own labor; if he gains wealth, it is by making\r\nothers labor for him. This is why, to the trades of actor and author,\r\nShakespeare added those of manager and director of a theatre. He\r\nacquired a share in the Blackfriars and Globe theatres, farmed tithes,\r\nbought large pieces of land, more houses, gave a dowry to his daughter\r\nSusanna, and finally retired to his native town on his property, in his\r\nown house, like a good landlord, an honest citizen, who manages his\r\nfortune fitly, and takes his share of municipal work. He had an income\r\nof two or three hundred pounds, which would be equivalent to about eight\r\nor twelve hundred at the present time, and according to tradition, lived\r\ncheerfully and on good terms with his neighbors; at all events, it does\r\nnot seem that he thought much about his literary glory, for he did not\r\neven take the trouble to collect and publish his works. One of his\r\ndaughters married a physician, the other a wine merchant; the last did\r\nnot even know how to sign her name. He lent money, and cut a good figure\r\nin this little world. Strange close; one which at first sight resembles\r\nmore that of a shopkeeper than of a poet. Must we attribute it to that\r\nEnglish instinct which places happiness in the life of a country\r\ngentleman and a landlord with a good rent-roll, well connected,\r\nsurrounded by comforts, who quietly enjoys his undoubted\r\nrespectability,[631] his domestic authority, and his county standing? Or\r\nrather, was Shakespeare, like Voltaire, a common-sense man, though of an\r\nimaginative brain, keeping a sound judgment under the sparkling of his\r\ngenius, prudent from scepticism, saving through a desire for\r\nindependence, and capable, after going the round of human ideas, of\r\ndeciding with Candide,[632] that the best thing one can do in this world\r\nis \"to cultivate one's garden\"? I had rather think, as his full and\r\nsolid head suggests,[633] that by the mere force of his overflowing\r\nimagination he escaped, like Goethe, the perils of an overflowing\r\nimagination; that in depicting passion, he succeeded, like Goethe, in\r\ndeadening passion; that the fire did not break out in his conduct,\r\nbecause it found issue in his poetry; that his theatre kept pure his\r\nlife; and that, having passed, by sympathy, through every kind of folly\r\nand wretchedness that is incident to human existence, he was able to\r\nsettle down amidst them with a calm and melancholic smile, listening,\r\nfor the sake of relaxation, to the aerial music of the fancies in which\r\nhe revelled.[634] I am willing to believe, lastly, that in frame as in\r\nother things, he belonged to his great generation and his great age;\r\nthat with him, as with Rabelais, Titian, Michel Angelo, and Rubens, the\r\nsolidity of the muscles was a counterpoise to the sensibility of the\r\nnerves; that in those days the human machine, more severely tried and\r\nmore firmly constructed, could withstand the storms of passion and the\r\nfire of inspiration; that soul and body were still at equilibrium; that\r\ngenius was then a blossom, and not, as now, a disease. We can but make\r\nconjectures about all this: if we would become acquainted more closely\r\nwith the man, we must seek him in his works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--Shakespeare's Style--Copiousness--Excesses\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us then look for the man, and in his style. The style explains the\r\nwork; whilst showing the principal features of the genius, it infers the\r\nrest. When we have once grasped the dominant faculty, we see the whole\r\nartist developed like a flower.\r\n\r\nShakespeare imagines with copiousness and excess; he scatters metaphors\r\nprofusely over all he writes; every instant abstract ideas are changed\r\ninto images; it is a series of paintings which is unfolded in his mind.\r\nHe does not seek them, they come of themselves; they crowd within him,\r\ncovering his arguments; they dim with their brightness the pure light of\r\nlogic. He does not labor to explain or prove; picture on picture, image\r\non image, he is forever copying the strange and splendid visions which\r\nare engendered one after another, and are heaped up within him. Compare\r\nto our dull writers this passage, which I take at hazard from a tranquil\r\ndialogue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The single and peculiar life is bound,\r\nWith all the strength and armor of the mind,\r\nTo keep itself from noyance; but much more\r\nThat spirit upon whose weal depend and rest\r\nThe lives of many. The cease of majesty\r\nDies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw\r\nWhat's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,\r\nFix'd on the summit of the highest mount,\r\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\r\nAre mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,\r\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\r\nAttends the boisterous ruin. Never alone\r\nDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.\"[635]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have three successive images to express the same thought. It is\r\na whole blossoming; a bough grows from the trunk, from that another,\r\nwhich is multiplied into numerous fresh branches. Instead of a smooth\r\nroad, traced by a regular line of dry and cunningly fixed landmarks, you\r\nenter a wood, crowded with interwoven trees and luxuriant bushes, which\r\nconceal and prevent your progress, which delight and dazzle your eyes by\r\nthe magnificence of their verdure and the wealth of their bloom. You are\r\nastonished at first, modern mind that you are, business man, used to the\r\nclear dissertations of classical poetry; you become cross; you think the\r\nauthor is amusing himself, and that through conceit and bad taste he is\r\nmisleading you and himself in his garden thickets. By no means; if he\r\nspeaks thus, it is not from choice, but of necessity; metaphor is not\r\nhis whim, but the form of his thought. In the height of passion, he\r\nimagines still. When Hamlet, in despair, remembers his father's noble\r\nform, he sees the mythological pictures with which the taste of the age\r\nfilled the very streets:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A station like the herald Mercury\r\nNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill.\"[636]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis charming vision, in the midst of a bloody invective, proves that\r\nthere lurks a painter underneath the poet. Involuntarily and out of\r\nseason, he tears off the tragic mask which covered his face; and the\r\nreader discovers, behind the contracted features of this terrible mask,\r\na graceful and inspired smile which he did not expect to see.\r\n\r\nSuch an imagination must needs be vehement. Every metaphor is a\r\nconvulsion. Whosoever involuntarily and naturally transforms a dry idea\r\ninto an image, has his brain on fire; true metaphors are flaming\r\napparitions, which are like a picture in a flash of lightning. Never, I\r\nthink, in any nation of Europe, or in any age of history, has so grand a\r\npassion been seen. Shakespeare's style is a compound of frenzied\r\nexpressions. No man has submitted words to such a contortion. Mingled\r\ncontrasts, tremendous exaggerations, apostrophes, exclamations; the\r\nwhole fury of the ode, confusion of ideas, accumulation of images, the\r\nhorrible and the divine, jumbled into the same line; it seems to my\r\nfancy as though he never writes a word without shouting it. \"What have I\r\ndone?\" the queen asks Hamlet. He answers:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Such an act\r\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\r\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\r\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\r\nAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows\r\nAs false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed\r\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\r\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\r\nA rhapsody of words: Heaven's face doth glow;\r\nYea, this solidity and compound mass,\r\nWith tristful visage, as against the doom,\r\nIs thought-sick at the act.\"[637]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the style of frenzy. Yet I have not given all. The metaphors are\r\nall exaggerated, the ideas all verge on the absurd. All is transformed\r\nand disfigured by the whirlwind of passion. The contagion of the crime,\r\nwhich he denounces, has marred all nature. He no longer sees anything in\r\nthe world but corruption and lying. To vilify the virtuous were little;\r\nhe vilifies virtue herself. Inanimate things are sucked into this\r\nwhirlpool of grief. The sky's red tint at sunset, the pallid darkness\r\nspread by night over the landscape, become the blush and the pallor of\r\nshame, and the wretched man who speaks and weeps sees the whole world\r\ntotter with him in the dimness of despair.\r\n\r\nHamlet, it will be said, is half-mad; this explains the vehemence of his\r\nexpressions. The truth is that Hamlet, here, is Shakespeare. Be the\r\nsituation terrible or peaceful, whether he is engaged on an invective or\r\na conversation, the style is excessive throughout. Shakespeare never\r\nsees things tranquilly. All the powers of his mind are concentrated in\r\nthe present image or idea. He is buried and absorbed in it. With such a\r\ngenius, we are on the brink of an abyss; the eddying water dashes in\r\nheadlong, swallowing up whatever objects it meets, and only bringing\r\nthem to light transformed and mutilated. We pause stupefied before these\r\nconvulsive metaphors, which might have been written by a fevered hand in\r\na night's delirium, which gather a pageful of ideas and pictures in half\r\na sentence, which scorch the eyes they would enlighten. Words lose their\r\nmeaning; constructions are put out of joint; paradoxes of style,\r\napparently false expressions, which a man might occasionally venture\r\nupon with diffidence in the transport of his rapture, become the\r\nordinary language. Shakespeare dazzles, repels, terrifies, disgusts,\r\noppresses; his verses are a piercing and sublime song, pitched in too\r\nhigh a key, above the reach of our organs, which offends our ears, of\r\nwhich our mind alone can divine the justice and beauty.\r\n\r\nYet this is little; for that singular force of concentration is\r\nredoubled by the suddenness of the dash which calls it into existence.\r\nIn Shakespeare there is no preparation, no adaptation, no development,\r\nno care to make himself understood. Like a too fiery and powerful horse,\r\nhe bounds, but cannot run. He bridges in a couple of words an enormous\r\ninterval; is at the two poles in a single instant. The reader vainly\r\nlooks for the intermediate track; dazed by these prodigious leaps, he\r\nwonders by what miracle the poet has entered upon a new idea the very\r\nmoment when he quitted the last, seeing perhaps between the two images a\r\nlong scale of transitions, which we mount with difficulty step by step,\r\nbut which he has spanned in a stride. Shakespeare flies, we creep. Hence\r\ncomes a style made up of conceits, bold images, shattered in an instant\r\nby others still bolder, barely indicated ideas completed by others far\r\nremoved, no visible connection, but a visible incoherence; at every step\r\nwe halt, the track failing; and there, far above us, lo, stands the\r\npoet, and we find that we have ventured in his footsteps, through a\r\ncraggy land, full of precipices, which he threads as if it were a\r\nstraightforward road, but on which our greatest efforts barely carry us\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nWhat will you think, further, if we observe that these vehement\r\nexpressions, so natural in their up-welling, instead of following one\r\nafter the other, slowly and with effort, are hurled out by hundreds,\r\nwith an impetuous ease and abundance, like the bubbling waves from a\r\nwelling spring, which are heaped together, rise one above another, and\r\nfind nowhere room enough to spread and exhaust themselves? You may find\r\nin \"Romeo and Juliet\" a score of examples of this inexhaustible\r\ninspiration. The two lovers pile up an infinite mass of metaphors,\r\nimpassioned exaggerations, clenches, contorted phrases, amorous\r\nextravagances. Their language is like the trill of nightingales.\r\nShakespeare's wits, Mercutio, Beatrice, Rosalind, his clowns, buffoons,\r\nsparkle with far-fetched jokes, which rattle out like a volley of\r\nmusketry. There is none of them but provides enough play on words to\r\nstock a whole theatre. Lear's curses, or Queen Margaret's, would suffice\r\nfor all the madmen in an asylum, or all the oppressed of the earth. The\r\nsonnets are a delirium of ideas and images, labored at with an obstinacy\r\nenough to make a man giddy. His first poem, \"Venus and Adonis,\" is the\r\nsensual ecstasy of a Correggio, insatiable and excited. This exuberant\r\nfecundity intensifies qualities already in excess, and multiplies a\r\nhundred-fold the luxuriance of metaphor, the incoherence of style, and\r\nthe unbridled vehemence of expression.[638]\r\n\r\nAll that I have said may be compressed into a few words. Objects were\r\ntaken into his mind organized and complete; they pass into ours\r\ndisjointed, decomposed, fragmentarily. He thought in the lump, we think\r\npiecemeal; hence his style and our style--two languages not to be\r\nreconciled. We, for our part, writers and reasoners, can note precisely\r\nby a word each isolated fraction of an idea, and represent the due order\r\nof its parts by the due order of our expressions. We advance gradually;\r\nwe follow the filiations, refer continually to the roots, try and treat\r\nour words as numbers, our sentences as equations; we employ but general\r\nterms, which every mind can understand, and regular constructions, into\r\nwhich any mind can enter; we attain justness and clearness, not life.\r\nShakespeare lets justness and clearness look out for themselves, and\r\nattains life. From amidst his' complex conception and his colored\r\nsemi-vision, he grasps a fragment, a quivering fibre, and shows it; it\r\nis for you, from this fragment, to divine the rest. He, behind the word,\r\nhas a whole picture, an attitude, a long argument abridged, a mass of\r\nswarming ideas; you know them, these abbreviative, condensive words:\r\nthese are they which we launch out amidst the fire of invention, in a\r\nfit of passion--words of slang or of fashion, which appeal to local\r\nmemory or individual experience;[639] little desultory and incorrect\r\nphrases, which, by their irregularity, express the suddenness and the\r\nbreaks of the inner sensation; trivial words, exaggerated figures.[640]\r\nThere is a gesture beneath each, a quick contraction of the brows, a\r\ncurl of laughing lips, a clown's trick, an unhinging of the whole\r\nmachine. None of them mark ideas, all suggest images; each is the\r\nextremity and issue of a complete mimic action; none is the expression\r\nand definition of a partial and limited idea. This is why Shakespeare is\r\nstrange and powerful, obscure and creative, beyond all the poets of his\r\nor any other age; the most immoderate of all violators of language, the\r\nmost marvellous of all creators of souls, the farthest removed from\r\nregular logic and classical reason, the one most capable of exciting in\r\nus a world of forms and of placing living beings before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Shakespeare's Language And Manners\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us reconstruct this world, so as to find in it the imprint of its\r\ncreator. A poet does not copy at random the manners which surround him;\r\nhe selects from this vast material, and involuntarily brings upon the\r\nstage the habits of the heart and conduct which best suit his talent. If\r\nhe is a logician, a moralist, an orator, as, for instance, one of the\r\nFrench great tragic poets (Racine) of the seventeenth century, he will\r\nonly represent noble manners; he will avoid low characters; he will have\r\na horror of menials and the plebs; he will observe the greatest decorum\r\namidst the strongest outbreaks of passion; he will reject as scandalous\r\nevery low or indecent word; he will give us reason, loftiness, good\r\ntaste throughout; he will suppress the familiarity, childishness,\r\nartlessness, gay banter of domestic life; he will blot out precise\r\ndetails, special traits, and will carry tragedy into a serene and\r\nsublime region, where his abstract personages, unencumbered by time and\r\nspace, after an exchange of eloquent harangues and able dissertations,\r\nwill kill each other becomingly, and as though they were merely\r\nconcluding a ceremony. Shakespeare does just the contrary, because his\r\ngenius is the exact opposite. His master faculty is an impassioned\r\nimagination, freed from the shackles of reason and morality. He abandons\r\nhimself to it, and finds in man nothing that he would care to lop off.\r\nHe accepts nature and finds it beautiful in its entirety. He paints it\r\nin its littlenesses, it deformities, its weaknesses, its excesses, its\r\nirregularities, and its rages; he exhibits man at his meals, in bed, at\r\nplay, drunk, mad, sick; he adds that which ought not to be seen to that\r\nwhich passes on the stage. He does not dream of ennobling, but of\r\ncopying human life, and aspires only to make his copy more energetic and\r\nmore striking than the original.\r\n\r\nHence the morals of this drama; and first, the want of dignity. Dignity\r\narises from self-command. A man selects the most noble of his acts and\r\nattitudes, and allows himself no other. Shakespeare's characters select\r\nnone, but allow themselves all. His kings are men, and fathers of\r\nfamilies. The terrible Leontes, who is about to order the death of his\r\nwife and his friend, plays like a child with his son: caresses him,\r\ngives him all the pretty pet names which mothers are wont to employ; he\r\ndares be trivial; he gabbles like a nurse; he has her language and\r\nfulfils her duties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Leontes._ What, hast smutch'd thy nose?\r\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\r\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:...\r\nCome, sir page,\r\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\r\nMost dear'st! my collop... Looking on the lines\r\nOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\r\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,\r\nIn my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,\r\nLest it should bite its master....\r\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\r\nThis squash, this gentleman!... My brother,\r\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\r\nDo seem to be of ours?\r\n_Polixenes._ If at home, sir,\r\nHe's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,\r\nNow my sworn friend and then mine enemy,\r\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:\r\nHe makes a July's day short as December,\r\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\r\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\"[641]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a score of such passages in Shakespeare. The great passions,\r\nwith him as in nature, are preceded or followed by trivial actions,\r\nsmall-talk, commonplace sentiments. Strong emotions are accidents in our\r\nlife: to drink, to eat, to talk of indifferent things, to carry out\r\nmechanically a habitual duty, to dream of some stale pleasure or some\r\nordinary annoyance, that is in which we employ all our time. Shakespeare\r\npaints us as we are; his heroes bow, ask people for news, speak of rain\r\nand fine weather, as often and as casually as ourselves, on the very eve\r\nof falling into the extremity of misery, or of plunging into fatal\r\nresolutions. Hamlet asks what's o'clock, finds the wind biting, talks of\r\nfeasts and music heard without; and this quiet talk, so unconnected with\r\nthe action, so full of slight, insignificant facts, which chance alone\r\nhas raised up and guided, lasts until the moment when his father's\r\nghost, rising in the darkness, reveals the assassination which it is his\r\nduty to avenge.\r\n\r\nReason tells us that our manners should be measured; this is why the\r\nmanners which Shakespeare paints are not so. Pure nature is violent,\r\npassionate: it admits no excuses, suffers no middle course, takes no\r\ncount of circumstances, wills blindly, breaks out into railing, has the\r\nirrationality, ardor, anger of children. Shakespeare's characters have\r\nhot blood and a ready hand. They cannot restrain themselves, they\r\nabandon themselves at once to their grief, indignation, love, and plunge\r\ndesperately down the steep slope, where their passion urges them. How\r\nmany need I quote? Timon, Posthumus, Cressida, all the young girls, all\r\nthe chief characters in the great dramas; everywhere Shakespeare paints\r\nthe unreflecting impetuosity of the impulse of the moment. Capulet tells\r\nhis daughter Juliet that in three days she is to marry Earl Paris, and\r\nbids her be proud of it; she answers that she is not proud of it, and\r\nyet she thanks the earl for this proof of love. Compare Capulet's fury\r\nwith the anger of Orgon,[642] and you may measure the difference of the\r\ntwo poets and the two civilizations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Capulet._ How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?\r\n'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'\r\nAnd yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,\r\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\r\nBut fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,\r\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter's church,\r\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\r\nOut, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!\r\nYou tallow-face!\r\n_Juliet._ Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\r\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\r\n_C._ Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch\r\nI tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,\r\nOr never after look me in the face:\r\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me;\r\nMy fingers itch....\r\n_Lady C._ You are too hot.\r\n_C._ God's bread! it makes me mad:\r\nDay, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,\r\nAlone, in company, still my care hath been\r\nTo have her match'd: and having now provided\r\nA gentleman of noble parentage,\r\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,\r\nStuff'd, as they say, with honorable parts,\r\nProportion'd as one's thoughts would wish a man;\r\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\r\nA whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\r\nTo answer, '_I'll not wed; I cannot love,\r\nI am too young; I pray you, pardon me_,'--\r\nBut, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:\r\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me:\r\nLook to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.\r\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:\r\nAn you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;\r\nAn you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\r\nFor, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee.\"[643]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis method of exhorting one's child to marry is peculiar to Shakespeare\r\nand the sixteenth century. Contradiction to these men was like a red rag\r\nto a bull; it drove them mad.\r\n\r\nWe might be sure that in this age, and on this stage, decency was a\r\nthing unknown. It is wearisome, being a check; men got rid of it,\r\nbecause it was wearisome. It is a gift of reason and morality; as\r\nindecency is produced by nature and passion. Shakespeare's words are too\r\nindecent to be translated. His characters call things by their dirty\r\nnames, and compel the thoughts to particular images of physical love.\r\nThe talk of gentlemen and ladies is full of coarse allusions; we should\r\nhave to find out an alehouse of the lowest description to hear like\r\nwords nowadays.[644]\r\n\r\nIt would be in an alehouse too that we should have to look for the rude\r\njests and brutal kind of wit which form the staple of these\r\nconversations. Kindly politeness is the slow fruit of advanced\r\nreflection; it is a sort of humanity and kindliness applied to small\r\nacts and everyday discourse; it bids man soften towards others, and\r\nforget himself for the sake of others; it constrains genuine nature,\r\nwhich is selfish and gross. This is why it is absent from the manners of\r\nthe drama we are considering. You will see carmen, out of sportiveness\r\nand good humor, deal one another hard blows; so it is pretty well with\r\nthe conversation of the lords and ladies of Shakespeare who are in a\r\nsportive mood; for instance, Beatrice and Benedick, very well bred folk\r\nas things go,[645] with a great reputation for wit and politeness, whose\r\nsmart retorts create amusement for the bystanders. These \"skirmishes of\r\nwit\" consist in telling one another plainly: You are a coward, a\r\nglutton, an idiot, a buffoon, a rake, a brute! You are a parrot's\r\ntongue, a fool, a... (the word is there). Benedick says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will go... to the Antipodes... rather than hold three\r\nwords' conference with this harpy.... I cannot endure my\r\nLady Tongue....\r\n_Don Pedro._ You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.\r\n_Beatrice._ So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should\r\nprove the mother of fools.\"[646]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can infer the tone they use when in anger. Emilia, in \"Othello,\"\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink\r\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callat.\"[647]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have a vocabulary of foul words as complete as that of Rabelais,\r\nand they exhaust it. They catch up handfuls of mud and hurl it at their\r\nenemy, not conceiving themselves to be smirched.\r\n\r\nTheir actions correspond. They go without shame or pity to the limits of\r\ntheir passion. They kill, poison, violate, burn; the stage is full of\r\nabominations. Shakespeare lugs upon the stage all the atrocious deeds of\r\nthe Civil Wars. These are the ways of wolves and hyenas. We must read of\r\nJack Cade's sedition[648] to gain an idea of this madness and fury. We\r\nmight imagine we were seeing infuriated beasts, the murderous\r\nrecklessness of a wolf in a sheepfold, the brutality of a hog fouling\r\nand rolling himself in filth and blood. They destroy, kill, butcher each\r\nother; with their feet in the blood of their victims, they call for food\r\nand drink; they stick heads on pikes and make them kiss one another, and\r\nthey laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Jack Cade._ There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for\r\na penny.... There shall be no money; all shall eat and drink on my\r\nscore, and I will apparel them all in one livery.... And here sitting\r\nupon London-stone, I charge and command that, of the city's cost, the\r\npissing-conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of our\r\nreign.... Away, burn all the records of the realm; my mouth shall be the\r\nparliament of England.... And henceforth all things shall be in\r\ncommon.... What canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of\r\nNormandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the dauphin of France?... The proudest\r\npeer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders, unless he pay\r\nme tribute; there shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me\r\nher maidenhead ere they have it. (_Re-enter rebels with the heads of\r\nLord Say and his son-in-law._) But is not this braver? Let them kiss one\r\nanother, for they loved well when they were alive.\"[649]\r\n\r\n\r\nMan must not be let loose; we know not what lusts and rage may brood\r\nunder a sober guise. Nature was never so hideous, and this hideousness\r\nis the truth.\r\n\r\nAre these cannibal manners only met with among the scum? Why, the\r\nprinces are worse. The Duke of Cornwall orders the old Earl of\r\nGloucester to be tied to a chair, because, owing to him, King Lear has\r\nescaped:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fellows, hold the chair.\r\nUpon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.\r\n(_Gloucester is held down in the chair, while Cornwall plucks\r\nout one of his eyes, and sets his foot on it._)\r\n_Glou._ He that will think to live till he be old,\r\nGive me some help! O cruel: O you gods!\r\n_Regan._ One side will mock another; the other too.\r\n_Cornwall._ If you see vengeance--\r\n_Servant._ Hold\tyour hand, my lord:\r\nI have served you ever since I was a child;\r\nBut better service have I never done you,\r\nThan now to bid you hold.\r\n_Regan._ How now, you dog!\r\n_Serv._ If you did wear a beard upon your chin,\r\nI'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?\r\n_Corn._ My villain! (_Draws and runs at him._)\r\n_Serv._ Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.\r\n(_Draws; they fight; Cornwall is wounded._)\r\n_Regan._ Give me thy sword. A peasant stands up thus.\r\n(_Snatches a sword, comes behind, and stabs him._)\r\n_Serv._ O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left\r\nTo see some mischief on him. O!\t(_Dies._)\r\n_Corn._ Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!\r\nWhere is thy lustre now?\r\n_Glou._ All dark and comfortless. Where's my son?...\r\n_Regan._ Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell\r\nHis way to Dover.\"[650]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the manners of that stage. They are unbridled, like those of\r\nthe age, and like the poet's imagination. To copy the common actions of\r\nevery-day life, the puerilities and feeblenesses to which the greatest\r\ncontinually sink, the outbursts of passion which degrade them, the\r\nindecent, harsh, or foul words, the atrocious deeds in which license\r\nrevels, the brutality and ferocity of primitive nature, is the work of a\r\nfree and unencumbered imagination. To copy this hideousness and these\r\nexcesses with a selection of such familiar, significant, precise\r\ndetails, that they reveal under every word of every personage a complete\r\ncivilization, is the work of a concentrated and all-powerful\r\nimagination. This species of manners and this energy of description\r\nindicate the same faculty, unique and excessive, which the style had\r\nalready indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--Dramatis Personæ\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this common background stands out in striking relief a population of\r\ndistinct living figures, illuminated by an intense light. This creative\r\npower is Shakespeare's great gift, and it communicates an extraordinary\r\nsignificance to his words. Every phrase pronounced by one of its\r\ncharacters enables us to see, besides the idea which it contains and the\r\nemotion which prompted it, the aggregate of the qualities and the entire\r\ncharacter which produced it--the mood, physical attitude, bearing, look\r\nof the man, all instantaneously, with a clearness and force approached\r\nby no one. The words which strike our ears are not the thousandth part\r\nof those we hear within; they are like sparks thrown off here and there;\r\nthe eyes catch rare flashes of flame; the mind alone perceives the vast\r\nconflagration of which they are the signs and the effect. He gives us\r\ntwo dramas in one: the first strange, convulsive, curtailed, visible;\r\nthe other consistent, immense, invisible; the one covers the other so\r\nwell, that as a rule we do not realize that we are perusing words: we\r\nhear the roll of those terrible voices, we see contracted features,\r\nglowing eyes, pallid faces; we see the agitation, the furious\r\nresolutions which mount to the brain with the feverish blood, and\r\ndescend to the sharp-strung nerves. This property possessed by every\r\nphrase to exhibit a world of sentiments and forms, comes from the fact\r\nthat the phrase is actually caused by a world of emotions and images.\r\nShakespeare, when he wrote, felt all that we feel, and much besides. He\r\nhad the prodigious faculty of seeing in a twinkling of the eye a\r\ncomplete character, body, mind, past and present, in every detail and\r\nevery depth of his being, with the exact attitude and the expression of\r\nface, which the situation demanded. A word here and there of Hamlet or\r\nOthello would need for its explanation three pages of commentaries; each\r\nof the half-understood thoughts, which the commentator may have\r\ndiscovered, has left its trace in the turn of the phrase, in the nature\r\nof the metaphor, in the order of the words; nowadays, in pursuing these\r\ntraces, we divine the thoughts. These innumerable traces have been\r\nimpressed in a second, within the compass of a line. In the next line\r\nthere are as many, impressed just as quickly, and in the same compass.\r\nYou can gauge the concentration and the velocity of the imagination\r\nwhich creates thus.\r\n\r\nThese characters are all of the same family. Good or bad, gross or\r\ndelicate, witty or stupid, Shakespeare gives them all the same kind of\r\nspirit which is his own. He has made of them imaginative people, void of\r\nwill and reason, impassioned machines, vehemently jostled one against\r\nanother, who were outwardly whatever is most natural and most abandoned\r\nin human nature. Let us act the play to ourselves, and see in all its\r\nstages this clanship of figures, this prominence of portraits.\r\n\r\nLowest of all are the stupid folk, babbling or brutish. Imagination\r\nalready exists there, where reason is not yet born; it exists also there\r\nwhere reason is dead. The idiot and the brute blindly follow the\r\nphantoms which exist in their benumbed or mechanical brains. No poet has\r\nunderstood this mechanism like Shakespeare. His Caliban, for instance, a\r\ndeformed savage, fed on roots, growls like a beast under the hand of\r\nProspero, who has subdued him. He howls continually against his master,\r\nthough he knows that every curse will be paid back with \"cramps and\r\naches.\" He is a chained wolf, trembling and fierce, who tries to bite\r\nwhen approached, and who crouches when he see's the lash raised. He has\r\na foul sensuality, a loud base laugh, the gluttony of degraded humanity.\r\nHe wishes to violate Miranda in her sleep. He cries for his food, and\r\ngorges himself when he gets it. A sailor who had landed in the island,\r\nStephano, gives him wine; he kisses his feet, and takes him for a god;\r\nhe asks if he has not dropped from heaven, and adores him. We find in\r\nhim rebellious and baffled passions, which are eager to rise again and\r\nto be satiated. Stephano had beaten his comrade. Caliban cries, \"Beat\r\nHim enough: after a little time I'll beat him too.\" He prays Stephano to\r\ncome with him and murder Prospero in his sleep; he thirsts to lead him\r\nthere, dances through joy and sees his master already with his \"weasand\"\r\ncut, and his brains scattered on the earth:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Prithee, my king, be quiet. See'st thou here,\r\nThis is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.\r\nDo that good mischief which may make this island\r\nThine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,\r\nFor aye thy foot-licker.\"[651]\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers, like Ajax and Cloten, are more like men, and yet it is pure mood\r\nthat Shakespeare depicts in them, as in Caliban. The clogging corporeal\r\nmachine, the mass of muscles, the thick blood sluggishly moving along in\r\nthe veins of these fighting men, oppress the intelligence, and leave no\r\nlife but for animal passions. Ajax uses his fists, and devours meat;\r\nthat is his existence; if he is jealous of Achilles, it is pretty much\r\nas a bull is jealous of his fellow. He permits himself to be restrained\r\nand led by Ulysses, without looking before him: the grossest flattery\r\ndecoys him. The Greeks have urged him to accept Hector's challenge.\r\nBehold him puffed up with pride, scorning to answer anyone, not knowing\r\nwhat he says or does. Thersites cries, \"Good-morrow, Ajax\"; and he\r\nreplies, \"Thanks, Agamemnon.\" He has no further thought than to\r\ncontemplate his enormous frame, and roll majestically his big stupid\r\neyes. When the day of the fight has come, he strikes at Hector as on an\r\nanvil. After a good while they are separated. \"I am not warm yet,\" says\r\nAjax, \"let us fight again.\"[652] Cloten is less massive than this\r\nphlegmatic ox; but he is just as idiotic, just as vainglorious, just as\r\ncoarse. The beautiful Imogen, urged by his insults and his scullion\r\nmanners, tells him that his whole body is not worth as much a\r\nPosthumus's meanest garment. He is stung to the quick, repeats the words\r\nseveral times; he cannot shake off the idea, and runs at it again and\r\nagain with his head down, like an angry ram:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Cloten._ 'His garment?' Now, the devil--\r\n_Imogen._ To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--\r\n_C._ 'His garment?'... You have abused me: 'His meanest\r\ngarment!'... I'll be revenged: 'His meanest garment!' Well.\"[653]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gets some of Posthumus's garments, and goes to Milford Haven,\r\nexpecting to meet Imogen there. On his way he mutters thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With that suit upon my back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in\r\nher eyes; there shall she see my valor, which will then be a torment to\r\nher contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his\r\ndead body, and when my lust has dined--which, as I say, to vex her I\r\nwill execute in the clothes that she so praised--to the court I'll knock\r\nher back, foot her home again.\"[654]\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers again, are but babblers: for example, Polonius, the grave\r\nbrainless counsellor; a great baby, not yet out of his \"swathing\r\nclouts\"; a solemn booby, who rains on men a shower of counsels,\r\ncompliments, and maxims; a sort of court speaking-trumpet, useful in\r\ngrand ceremonies, with the air of a thinker, but fit only to spout\r\nwords. But the most complete of all these characters is that of the\r\nnurse in \"Romeo and Juliet,\" a gossip, loose in her talk, a regular\r\nkitchen oracle, smelling of the stewpan and old boots, foolish,\r\nimpudent, immoral, but otherwise a good creature, and affectionate to\r\nher nurse-child. Mark this disjointed and never-ending gossip's babble:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Nurse._ 'Faith I can tell her age unto an hour.\r\n_Lady Capulet._ She's not fourteen....\r\n_Nurse._ Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.\r\nSusan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--\r\nWere of an age: well, Susan is with God;\r\nShe was too good for me: but, as I said,\r\nOn Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;\r\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\r\n'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\r\nAnd she was wean'd--I never shall forget it--\r\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\r\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\r\nSitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;\r\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua:--\r\nNay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,\r\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\r\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\r\nTo see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\r\nShake, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,\r\nTo bid me trudge:\r\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\r\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,\r\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\r\nFor even the day before, she broke her brow.\"[655]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen she tells an indecent anecdote, which she begins over again four\r\ntimes. She is silenced: what then? She has her anecdote in her head, and\r\ncannot cease repeating it and laughing to herself. Endless repetitions\r\nare the mind's first step. The vulgar do not pursue the straight line of\r\nreasoning and of the story; they repeat their steps, as it were merely\r\nmarking time: struck with an image, they keep it for an hour before\r\ntheir eyes, and are never tired of it. If they do advance, they turn\r\naside to a hundred subordinate ideas before they get at the phrase\r\nrequired. They allow themselves to be diverted by all the thoughts which\r\ncome across them. This is what the nurse does; and when she brings\r\nJuliet news of her lover, she torments and wearies her, less from a wish\r\nto tease than from a habit of wandering from the point:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Nurse._ Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?\r\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\r\n_Juliet._ How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\r\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\r\nIs thy news good, or bad? answer to that;\r\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance:\r\nLet me be satisfied: is't good or bad?\r\n_N._ Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose\r\na man: Romeo! no, not he: though his face be better than any man's,\r\nyet his legs excels all men's; and for a hand and a foot, and a body,\r\nthough they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare: he is\r\nnot the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.\r\nGo thy ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?\r\n_J._ No, no: but all this did I know before.\r\nWhat says he of our marriage? what of that?\r\n_N._ Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!\r\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\r\nMy back o' t'other side--O, my back, my back!\r\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about,\r\nTo catch my death with jaunting up and down!\r\n_J._ I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\r\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\r\n_N._ Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and\r\na kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous--Where is your\r\nmother?\"[656]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is never-ending. Her gabble is worse when she comes to announce to\r\nJuliet the death of her cousin and the banishment of Romeo. It is the\r\nshrill cry and chatter of an overgrown asthmatic magpie. She laments,\r\nconfuses the names, spins roundabout sentences, ends by asking for\r\n_aqua-vitœ._ She curses Romeo, then brings him to Juliet's chamber.\r\nNext day Juliet is ordered to marry Earl Paris; Juliet throws herself\r\ninto her nurse's arms, praying for comfort, advice, assistance. The\r\nother finds the true remedy: Marry Paris,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O, he's a lovely gentleman!\r\nRomeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,\r\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\r\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\r\nI think you are happy in this second match.\r\nFor it excels your first.\"[657]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cool immorality, these weather-cock arguments, this fashion of\r\nestimating love like a fishwoman, completes the portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--Men of Wit\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mechanical imagination produces Shakespeare's fool-characters: a\r\nquick, venturesome, dazzling, unquiet imagination, produces his men of\r\nwit. Of wit there are many kinds. One, altogether French, which is but\r\nreason, a foe to paradox, scorner of folly, a sort of incisive\r\ncommon-sense, having no occupation but to render truth amusing and\r\nevident, the most effective weapon with an intelligent and vain people:\r\nsuch was the wit of Voltaire and the drawing-rooms. The other, that of\r\nimprovisators and artists, is a mere inventive rapture, paradoxical,\r\nunshackled, exuberant, a sort of self-entertainment, a phantasmagoria of\r\nimages, flashes of wit, strange ideas, dazing and intoxicating, like the\r\nmovement and illumination in a ball-room. Such is the wit of Mercutio,\r\nof the clowns, of Beatrice, Rosalind, and Benedick. They laugh, not from\r\na sense of the ridiculous, but from the desire to laugh. You must look\r\nelsewhere for the campaigns with aggressive reason makes against human\r\nfolly. Here folly is in its full bloom. Our folk think of amusement, and\r\nnothing more. They are good-humored; they let their wit prance gayly\r\nover the possible and the impossible. They play upon words, contort\r\ntheir sense, draw absurd and laughable inferences, send them back to one\r\nanother, and without intermission, as if with shuttlecocks, and vie with\r\neach other in singularity and invention. They dress all their ideas in\r\nstrange or sparkling metaphors. The taste of the time was for\r\nmasquerades; their conversation is a masquerade of ideas. They say\r\nnothing in a simple style; they only seek to heap together subtle\r\nthings, far-fetched, difficult to invent and to understand; all their\r\nexpressions are over-refined, unexpected, extraordinary; they strain\r\ntheir thought, and change it into a caricature. \"Alas, poor Romeo!\" says\r\nMercutio, \"he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye;\r\nshot through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his heart cleft\r\nwith the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft.\"[658] Benedick relates a\r\nconversation he has just held with his mistress: \"O, she misused me past\r\nthe endurance of a block! an oak, but with one green leaf on it would\r\nhave answered her; my very visor began to assume life, and scold with\r\nher.\"[659] These gay and perpetual extravagances show the bearing of the\r\nspeakers. They do not remain quietly seated in their chairs, like the\r\nMarquesses in the \"Misanthrope\"; they whirl round, leap, paint their\r\nfaces, gesticulate boldly their ideas; their wit-rockets end with a\r\nsong. Young folk, soldiers and artists, they let off their fireworks of\r\nphrases, and gambol round about. \"There was a star danced, and under\r\nthat was I born.\"[660] This expression of Beatrice's aptly describes the\r\nkind of poetical, sparkling, unreasoning, charming wit, more akin to\r\nmusic than to literature, a sort of dream, which is spoken out aloud,\r\nand whilst wide awake, not unlike that described by Mercutio:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\r\nShe is the fairies' midwife; and she comes\r\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\r\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\r\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\r\nAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\r\nHer wagon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,\r\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\r\nThe traces of the smallest spider's web,\r\nThe collars of the moonshine's watery beams,\r\nHer whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,\r\nHer wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,\r\nNot half so big as a round little worm\r\nPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\r\nHer chariot is an empty hazel-nut,\r\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\r\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\r\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\r\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\r\nO'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,\r\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,\r\nO'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream....\r\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\r\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\r\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\r\nTickling a person's nose as a' lies asleep,\r\nThen dreams he of another benefice:\r\nSometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\r\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\r\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\r\nOf healths five-fathom deep: and then anon\r\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\r\nAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\r\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\r\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night,\r\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\r\nWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes...\r\nThis is she.\"[661]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOICE EXAMPLES OF BOOK ILLUMINATION.\r\nFac-similes from Illuminated Manuscripts and Illustrated Books\r\nof Early Date.\r\n\r\n_TITLE-PAGE OF THE HYPNEROTOMACHIA._\r\n\r\nThe present frontispiece belongs to a French translation of the work of\r\nPoliphilo, the only book with decorated borders and insertions ever\r\npublished by the Venetian Aldi. They printed the Hypnerotomachia in\r\n1499, and it was reproduced in a French translation, with the present\r\ntitle-page by the Parisian printer, Jacques Kerver, in 1546. All the\r\nprofuse embellishments of the Aldine edition were retained, but the\r\ntitle-page here reproduced is from a design of the famous French\r\nsculptor, Jean Goujon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomeo interrupts him, or he would never end. Let the reader compare with\r\nthe dialogue of the French theatre this little poem\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Child of an idle brain,\r\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\"[662]\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduced without incongruity in the midst of a conversation of the\r\nsixteenth century, and he will understand the difference between the wit\r\nwhich devotes itself to reasoning, or to record a subject for laughter,\r\nand that imagination which is self-amused with its own act.\r\n\r\nFalstaff has the passions of an animal, and the imagination of a man of\r\nwit. There is no character which better exemplifies the fire and\r\nimmorality of Shakespeare. Falstaff is a great supporter of disreputable\r\nplaces, swearer, gamester, idler, wine-bibber, as low as he well can be.\r\nHe has a big belly, bloodshot eyes, bloated face, shaking legs; he\r\nspends his life with his elbows among the tavern-jugs, or asleep on the\r\nground behind the arras; he only wakes to curse, lie, brag, and steal.\r\nHe is as big a swindler as Panurge, who had sixty-three ways of making\r\nmoney, \"of which the honestest was by sly theft.\" And what is worse, he\r\nis an old man, a knight, a courtier, and well educated. Must he not be\r\nodious and repulsive? By no means; we cannot help liking him. At bottom,\r\nlike his brother Panurge, he is \"the best fellow in the world.\" He has\r\nno malice in his composition; no other wish than to laugh and be amused.\r\nWhen insulted, he bawls out louder than his attackers, and pays them\r\nback with interest in coarse words and insults; but he owes them no\r\ngrudge for it. The next minute he is sitting down with them in a low\r\ntavern, drinking their health like a brother and comrade. If he has\r\nvices, he exposes them so frankly that we are obliged to forgive him\r\nthem. He seems to say to us, \"Well, so I am, what then? I like drinking:\r\nisn't the wine good? I take to my heels when hard hitting begins; don't\r\nblows hurt? I get into debt, and do fools out their money; isn't it nice\r\nto have money in your pocket? I brag; isn't it natural to want to be\r\nwell thought of?\"--\"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest, in the state of\r\ninnocency, Adam fell; and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days\r\nof villainy? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man, and\r\ntherefore more frailty.\"[663] Falstaff is so frankly immoral, that he\r\nceases to be so. Conscience ends at a certain point; nature assumes its\r\nplace, and man rushes upon what he desires, without more thought of\r\nbeing just or unjust than an animal in the neighboring wood. Falstaff,\r\nengaged in recruiting, has sold exemptions to all the rich people, and\r\nonly enrolled starved and half-naked wretches. There's but a shirt and a\r\nhalf in all his company: that does not trouble him. Bah: \"they'll find\r\nlinen enough on every hedge.\" The prince, who has seen them, says, \"I\r\ndid never see such pitiful rascals. Tut, tut,\" answers Falstaff, \"good\r\nenough to toss; food for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better;\r\ntush, man, mortal men, mortal men.\"[664] His second excuse is his\r\nunfailing spirit. If ever there was a man who could jabber, it is he.\r\nInsults and oaths, curses, jobations, protests, flow from him as from an\r\nopen barrel. He is never at a loss; he devises a shift for every\r\ndifficulty. Lies sprout out of him, fructify, increase, beget one\r\nanother, like mushrooms on a rich and rotten bed of earth. He lies still\r\nmore from his imagination and nature than from interest and necessity.\r\nIt is evident from the manner in which he strains his fictions. He says\r\nhe has fought alone against two men. The next moment it is four.\r\nPresently we have seven, then eleven, then fourteen. He is stopped in\r\ntime, or he would soon be talking of a whole army. When unmasked, he\r\ndoes not lose his temper, and is the first to laugh at his boastings.\r\n\"Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold.... What, shall we be merry? shall\r\nwe have a play extempore?\"[665] He does the scolding part of King Henry\r\nwith so much truth that we might take him for a king, or an actor. This\r\nbig potbellied fellow, a coward, a cynic, a brawler, a drunkard, a lewd\r\nrascal, a pothouse poet, is one of Shakespeare's favorites. The reason\r\nis, that his morals are those of pure nature, and Shakespeare's mind is\r\ncongenial with his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--Shakespeare's Women\r\n\r\n\r\nNature is shameless and gross amidst this mass of flesh, heavy with wine\r\nand fatness. It is delicate in the delicate body of women, but as\r\nunreasoning and impassioned in Desdemona as in Falstaff. Shakespeare's\r\nwomen are charming children, who feel in excess and love passionately.\r\nThey have unconstrained manners, little rages, nice words of friendship,\r\na coquettish rebelliousness, a graceful volubility, which recall the\r\nwarbling and the prettiness of birds. The heroines of the French stage\r\nare almost men; these are women, and in every sense of the word. More\r\nimprudent than Desdemona a woman could not be. She is moved with pity\r\nfor Cassio, and asks a favor for him passionately, recklessly, be the\r\nthing just or no, dangerous or no. She knows nothing of man's laws, and\r\ndoes not think of them. All that she sees is, that Cassio is unhappy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Be thou assured, good Cassio... My lord shall never rest;\r\nI'll watch him, tame and talk him out of patience;\r\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\r\nI'll intermingle everything he does\r\nWith Cassio's suit.\"[666]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe asks her favor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Othello._ Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.\r\n_Desdemona._ But shall't be shortly?\r\n_O._ The sooner, sweet, for you.\r\n_Des._ Shall't be to-night at supper?\r\n_O._ No, not to-night.\r\n_Des._ To-morrow dinner, then?\r\n_O._ I shall not dine at home;\r\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\r\n_Des._ Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;\r\nOn Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn;\r\nI prithee, name the time, but let it not\r\nExceed three days: in faith, he's penitent.\"[667]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is somewhat astonished to see herself refused: she scolds Othello.\r\nHe yields: who would not yield seeing a reproach in those lovely sulking\r\neyes? O, says she, with a pretty pout:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This is not a boon;\r\n'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\r\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\r\nOr sue to you to do peculiar profit\r\nTo your own person.\"[668]\r\n\r\n\r\nA moment after, when he prays her to leave him alone for a while, mark\r\nthe innocent gayety, the ready observance, the playful child's tone:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord....\r\nEmilia, come: Be as your fancies teach you;\r\nWhate'er you be, I am obedient.\"[669]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vivacity, this petulance, does not prevent shrinking modesty and\r\nsilent timidity: on the contrary, they spring from a common cause,\r\nextreme sensibility. She who feels much and quickly has more reserve and\r\nmore passion than others; she breaks out or is silent; she says nothing\r\nor everything. Such is this Imogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,\r\nAnd strokes death to her.\"[670]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is Virgilia, the sweet wife of Coriolanus; her heart is not a Roman\r\none; she is terrified at her husband's victories: when Volumnia\r\ndescribes him stamping on the field of battle, and wiping his bloody\r\nbrow with his hand, she grows pale:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!...\r\nHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!\"[671]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe wishes to forget all that she knows of these dangers; she dare not\r\nthink of them. When asked if Coriolanus does not generally return\r\nwounded, she cries, \"O, no, no, no.\" She avoids this cruel picture, and\r\nyet nurses a secret pang at the bottom of her heart. She will not leave\r\nthe house: \"I'll not over the threshold till my lord return.\"[672] She\r\ndoes not smile, will hardly admit a visitor; she would blame herself, as\r\nfor a lack of tenderness, for a moment's forgetfulness or gayety. When\r\nhe does return, she can only blush and weep. This exalted sensibility\r\nmust needs end in love. All Shakespeare's women love without measure,\r\nand nearly all at first sight. At the first look Juliet cast on Romeo,\r\nshe says to the nurse:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Go, ask his name: if he be married,\r\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\"[673]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the revelation of their destiny. As Shakespeare has made them,\r\nthey cannot but love, and they must love till death. But this first look\r\nis an ecstasy: and this sudden approach of love is a transport. Miranda\r\nseeing Fernando, fancies that she sees \"a thing divine.\" She halts\r\nmotionless, in the amazement of this sudden vision, at the sound of\r\nthese heavenly harmonies which rise from the depths of her heart. She\r\nweeps, on seeing him drag the heavy logs; with her slender white hands\r\nshe would do the work whilst he reposed. Her compassion and tenderness\r\ncarry her away; she is no longer mistress of her words, she says what\r\nshe would not, what her father has forbidden her to disclose, what an\r\ninstant before she would never have confessed. The too full heart\r\noverflows unwittingly, happy, and ashamed at the current of joy and new\r\nsensations with which an unknown feeling has flooded her:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Miranda._ I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of....\r\n_Fernando._ Wherefore weep you?\r\n_M._ At mine unworthiness that dare not offer\r\nWhat I desire to give, and much less take\r\nWhat I shall die to want....\r\nI am your wife, if you will marry me;\r\nIf not, I'll die your maid.\"[674]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis irresistible invasion of love transforms the whole character. The\r\nshrinking and tender Desdemona, suddenly, in full Senate, before her\r\nfather, renounces her father; dreams not for an instant of asking his\r\npardon, or consoling him. She will leave for Cyprus with Othello,\r\nthrough the enemy's fleet and the tempest. Everything vanishes before\r\nthe one and adored image which has taken entire and absolute possession\r\nof her whole heart. So, extreme evils, bloody resolves, are only the\r\nnatural sequence of such love. Ophelia becomes mad, Juliet commits\r\nsuicide; no one but looks upon such madness and death as necessary. You\r\nwill not then discover virtue in these souls, for by virtue is implied a\r\ndeterminate desire to do good, and a rational observance of duty. They\r\nare only pure through delicacy or love. They recoil from vice as a gross\r\nthing, not as an immoral thing. What they feel is not respect for the\r\nmarriage vow, but adoration of their husband. \"O sweetest, fairest\r\nlily!\" So Cymbeline speaks of one of these frail and lovely flowers\r\nwhich cannot be torn from the tree to which they have grown, whose least\r\nimpurity would tarnish their whiteness. When Imogen learns that her\r\nhusband means to kill her as being faithless, she does not revolt at the\r\noutrage; she has no pride, but only love. \"False to his bed!\" She faints\r\nat the thought that she is no longer loved. When Cordelia hears her\r\nfather, an irritable old man, already almost insane, ask her how she\r\nloves him, she cannot make up her mind to say aloud the flattering\r\nprotestations which her sisters have been lavishing. She is ashamed to\r\ndisplay her tenderness before the world, and to buy a dowry by it. He\r\ndisinherits her, and drives her away; she holds her tongue. And when she\r\nafterwards finds him abandoned and mad, she goes on her knees before\r\nhim, with such a touching emotion, she weeps over that dear insulted\r\nhead with so gentle a pity, that you might fancy it was the tender voice\r\nof a desolate but delighted mother, kissing the pale lips of her child:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O yon kind gods,\r\nCure this great breach in his abused nature!\r\nThe untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up\r\nOf this child-changed father!...\r\nO my dear father! Restoration hang\r\nThy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss\r\nRepair those violent harms that my two sisters\r\nHave in thy reverence made!... Was this a face\r\nTo be opposed against the warring winds?\r\n... Mine enemy's dog,\r\nThough he had bit me, should have stood that night\r\nAgainst my fire....\r\nHow does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?\"[675]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, in short, Shakespeare comes across a heroic character, worthy of\r\nCorneille, a Roman, such as the mother of Coriolanus, he will explain by\r\npassion what Corneille would have explained by heroism. He will depict\r\nit violent and thirsting for the violent feelings of glory. She will not\r\nbe able to refrain herself. She will break out into accents of triumph\r\nwhen she sees her son crowned; into imprecations of vengeance when she\r\nsees him banished. She will descend to the vulgarities of pride and\r\nanger; she will abandon herself to mad effusions of joy, to dreams of an\r\nambitious fancy,[676] and will prove once more that the impassioned\r\nimagination of Shakespeare has left its trace in all the creatures whom\r\nit has called forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--Types of Villains\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is easier to such a poet than to create perfect villains.\r\nThroughout he is handling the unruly passions which make their\r\ncharacter, and he never hits upon the moral law which restrains them;\r\nbut at the same time, and by the same faculty, he changes the inanimate\r\nmasks, which the conventions of the stage mould on an identical pattern,\r\ninto living and illusory figures. How shall a demon be made to look as\r\nreal as a man? Iago is a soldier of fortune who has roved the world from\r\nSyria to England, who, nursed in the lowest ranks, having had close\r\nacquaintance with the horrors of the wars of the sixteenth century, had\r\ndrawn thence the maxims of a Turk and the philosophy of a butcher;\r\nprinciples he has none left. \"O my reputation, my reputation!\" cries the\r\ndishonored Cassio. \"As I am an honest man,\" says Iago, \"I thought you\r\nhad received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in\r\nreputation.\"[677] As for woman's virtue, he looks upon it like a man who\r\nhas kept company with slave-dealers. He estimates Desdemona's love as he\r\nwould estimate a mare's: that sort of thing lasts so long--then... And\r\nthen he airs an experimental theory with precise details and nasty\r\nexpressions like a stud doctor. \"It cannot be that Desdemona should long\r\ncontinue her love to the Moor, nor he his to her.... These Moors are\r\nchangeable in their wills;... the food that to him now is as luscious as\r\nlocusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must\r\nchange for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the\r\nerror of her choice.\"[678] Desdemona, on the shore, trying! to forget\r\nher cares, begs him to sing the praises of her sex. For every portrait\r\nhe finds the most insulting insinuations. She insists, and bids him take\r\nthe case of a deserving woman. \"Indeed,\" he replies, \"she was a wight,\r\nif ever such wight were,... to suckle fools and chronicle small\r\nbeer.\"[679] He also says, when Desdemona asks him what he would write in\r\npraise of her: \"O gentle lady do not put me to't, for I am nothing, if\r\nnot critical.\"[680] This is the key to his character. He despises man;\r\nto him Desdemona is a little wanton wench, Cassio an elegant\r\nword-shaper, Othello a mad bull, Roderigo an ass to be basted, thumped,\r\nmade to go. He diverts himself by setting these passions at issue; he\r\nlaughs at it as at a play. When Othello, swooning, shakes in his\r\nconvulsions, he rejoices at this capital result: \"Work on, my medicine,\r\nwork! Thus credulous fools are caught.\"[681] You would take him for one\r\nof the poisoners of the time, studying the effect of a new potion on a\r\ndying dog. He only speaks in sarcasms; he has them ready for everyone,\r\neven for those whom he does not know. When he wakes Brabantio to inform\r\nhim of the elopement of his daughter, he tells him the matter in coarse\r\nterms, sharpening the sting of the bitter pleasantry, like a\r\nconscientious executioner, rubbing his hands when he hears the culprit\r\ngroan under the knife. \"Thou art a villain!\" cries Brabantio. \"You\r\nare--a senator!\" answers Iago. But the feature which really completes\r\nhim, and makes him take rank with Mephistopheles, is the atrocious truth\r\nand the cogent reasoning by which he likens his crime to virtue.[682]\r\nCassio, under his advice, goes to see Desdemona, to obtain her\r\nintercession for him; this visit is to be the ruin of Desdemona and\r\nCassio. Iago, left alone, hums for an instant quietly, then cries:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what's he then that says I play the villain?\r\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\r\nProbal to thinking and indeed the course\r\nTo win the Moor again.\"[683]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all these features must be added a diabolical energy,[684] an\r\ninexhaustible inventiveness in images, caricatures, obscenity, the\r\nmanners of a guard-room, the brutal bearing and tastes of a trooper,\r\nhabits of dissimulation, coolness, hatred, and patience, contracted amid\r\nthe perils and devices of a military life, and the continuous miseries\r\nof long degradation and frustrated hope; you will understand how\r\nShakespeare could transform abstract treachery into a concrete form, and\r\nhow Iago's atrocious vengeance is only the natural consequence of his\r\ncharacter, life, and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.--Principal Characters\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much more visible is this impassioned and unfettered genius of\r\nShakespeare in the great characters which sustain the whole weight of\r\nthe drama! The startling imagination, the furious velocity of the\r\nmanifold and exuberant ideas, passion let loose, rushing upon death and\r\ncrime, hallucinations, madness, all the ravages of delirium bursting\r\nthrough will and reason: such are the forces and ravings which engender\r\nthem. Shall I speak of dazzling Cleopatra, who holds Antony in the\r\nwhirlwind of her devices and caprices, who fascinates and kills, who\r\nscatters to the winds the lives of men as a handful of desert dust, the\r\nfatal Eastern sorceress who sports with love and death, impetuous,\r\nirresistible, child of air and fire, whose life is but a tempest, whose\r\nthought, ever barbed and broken, is like the crackling of a lightning\r\nflash? Of Othello, who, beset by the graphic picture of physical\r\nadultery, cries at every word of Iago like a man on the rack; who, his\r\nnerves hardened by twenty years of war and shipwreck, grows mad and\r\nswoons for grief, and whose soul, poisoned by jealousy, is distracted\r\nand disorganized in convulsions and in stupor? Or of old King Lear,\r\nviolent and weak, whose half-unseated reason is gradually toppled over\r\nunder the shocks of incredible treacheries, who presents the frightful\r\nspectacle of madness, first increasing, then complete, of curses,\r\nbowlings, superhuman sorrows, into which the transport of the first\r\naccess of fury carries him, and then of peaceful incoherence, chattering\r\nimbecility, into which the shattered man subsides; a marvellous\r\ncreation, the supreme effort of pure imagination, a disease of reason,\r\nwhich reason could never have conceived?[685] Amid so many portraitures\r\nlet us choose two or three to indicate the depth and nature of them all.\r\nThe critic is lost in Shakespeare, as in an immense town; he will\r\ndescribe a couple of monuments, and entreat the reader to imagine the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nPlutarch's Coriolanus is an austere, coldly haughty patrician, a general\r\nof the army. In Shakespeare's hands he becomes a coarse soldier, a man\r\nof the people as to his language and manners, an athlete of war, with a\r\nvoice like a trumpet; whose eyes by contradiction are filled with a rush\r\nof blood and anger, proud and terrible in mood, a lion's soul in the\r\nbody of a bull. The philosopher Plutarch told of him a lofty philosophic\r\naction, saying that he had been at pains to save his landlord in the\r\nsack of Corioli. Shakespeare's Coriolanus has indeed the same\r\ndisposition, for he is really a good fellow; but when Lartius asks him\r\nthe name of this poor Volscian, in order to secure his liberty, he yawns\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By Jupiter! forgot.\r\nI am weary; yea, my memory is tired.\r\nHave we no wine here?\"[686]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is hot, he has been fighting, he must drink; he leaves his Volscian\r\nin chains, and thinks no more of him. He fights like a porter, with\r\nshouts and insults, and the cries from that deep chest are heard above\r\nthe din of the battle like the sounds from a brazen trumpet. He has\r\nscaled the walls of Corioli, he has butchered till he is gorged with\r\nslaughter. Instantly he turns to the army of Cominius, and arrives red\r\nwith blood, \"as he were flay'd. Come I too late?\" Cominius begins to\r\ncompliment him. \"Come I too late?\" he repeats. The battle is not yet\r\nfinished: he embraces Cominius:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O! let me clip ye\r\nIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart\r\nAs merry as when our nuptial day was done.\"[687]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the battle is a real holiday to him. Such senses, such a strong\r\nframe, need the outcry, the din of battle, the excitement of death and\r\nwounds. This haughty and indomitable heart needs the joy of victory and\r\ndestruction. Mark the display of his patrician arrogance and his\r\nsoldier's bearing, when he is offered the tenth of the spoils:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, general;\r\nBut cannot make my heart consent to take\r\nA bribe to pay my sword.\"[688]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers cry, Marcius! Marcius! and the trumpets sound. He gets into\r\na passion: rates the brawlers:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd\r\nMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch--\r\n... You shout me forth\r\nIn acclamations hyperbolical;\r\nAs if I loved my little should be dieted\r\nIn praises sauced with lies.\"[689]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are reduced to loading him with honors: Cominius gives him a\r\nwar-horse; decrees him the cognomen of Coriolanus; the people shout\r\nCaius Marcius Coriolanus! He replies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will go wash;\r\nAnd when my face is fair, you shall perceive\r\nWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.\r\nI mean to stride your steed.\"[690]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis loud voice, loud laughter, blunt acknowledgment, of a man who can\r\nact and shout better than speak, foretell the mode in which he will\r\ntreat the plebeians. He loads them with insults; he cannot find abuse\r\nenough for the cobblers, tailors, envious cowards, down on their knees\r\nfor a coin. \"To beg of Hob and Dick! Bid them wash their faces and\r\nkeep their teeth clean.\" But he must beg, if he would be consul; his\r\nfriends constrain him. It is then that the passionate soul, incapable of\r\nself-restraint, such as Shakespeare knew how to paint, breaks forth\r\nwithout hinderance. He is there in his candidate's gown, gnashing his\r\nteeth, and getting up his lesson in this style:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What must I say?\r\n'I pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring\r\nMy tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!\r\nI got them in my country's service, when\r\nSome certain of your brethren roar'd and ran\r\nFrom the noise of our own drums.'\"[691]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tribunes have no difficulty in stopping the election of a candidate\r\nwho begs in this fashion. They taunt him in full Senate, reproach him\r\nwith his speech about the corn. He repeats it, with aggravations. Once\r\nroused, neither danger nor prayer restrains him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His heart's his mouth:\r\nAnd, being angry, does forget that ever\r\nHe heard the name of death.\"[692]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe rails against the people, the tribunes, ediles, flatterers of the\r\nplebs. \"Come, enough,\" says his friend Menenius. \"Enough, with\r\nover-measure,\" says Brutus the tribune. He retorts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, take more:\r\nWhat may be sworn by, both divine and human,\r\nSeal what I end withal!... At once pluck out\r\nThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\r\nThe sweet which is their poison.\"[693]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tribune cries, Treason! and bids seize him. He cries:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hence, old goat!...\r\nHence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones\r\nOut of thy garments!\"[694]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe strikes him, drives the mob off: he fancies himself amongst\r\nVolscians. \"On fair ground I could beat forty of them!\" And when his\r\nfriends hurry him off, he threatens still, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Speak(s) o' the people\r\nAs if you (he) were a god to punish, not\r\nA man of their infirmity.\"[695]\r\n\r\n\r\nYet he bends before his mother, for he has recognized in her a soul as\r\nlofty and a courage as intractable as his own. He has submitted from his\r\ninfancy to the ascendancy of this pride which he admires. Volumnia\r\nreminds him: \"My praises made thee first a soldier.\" Without power over\r\nhimself, continually tossed on the fire of his too hot blood, he has\r\nalways been the arm, she the thought. He obeys from involuntary respect,\r\nlike a soldier before his general, but with what effort!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Coriolanus._ The smiles of knaves\r\nTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up\r\nThe glances of my sight! a beggar's tongue\r\nMake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees\r\nWho bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his\r\nThat hath received an alms!--I will not do't....\r\n_Volumnia._ ... Do as thou list.\r\nThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,\r\nBut owe thy pride thyself.\r\n_Cor._ Pray, be content:\r\nMother, I am going to the market-place;\r\nChide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,\r\nCog their hearts from them, and come home beloved\r\nOf all the trades in Rome.\"[696]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe goes, and his friends speak for him. Except a few bitter asides, he\r\nappears to be submissive. Then the tribunes pronounce the accusation,\r\nand summon him to answer as a traitor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Cor._ How! traitor!\r\n_Men._ Nay, temperately: your promise.\r\n_Cor._ The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!\r\nCall me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!\r\nWithin thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,\r\nIn thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in\r\nThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say,\r\n'Thou liest,' unto thee with a voice as free\r\nAs I do pray the gods.\"[697]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis friends surround him, entreat him: he will not listen; he foams at\r\nthe mouth, he is like a wounded lion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,\r\nVagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger\r\nBut with a grain a day, I would not buy\r\nTheir mercy at the price of one fair word.\"[698]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people vote exile, supporting by their shouts the sentence of the\r\ntribune:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Cor._ You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate\r\nAs reek o' the rotten fens, whose love I prize\r\nAs the dead carcasses of unburied men\r\nThat do corrupt my air, I banish you.... Despising,\r\nFor you, the city, thus I turn my back:\r\nThere is a world elsewhere.\"[699]\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge of his hatred by these raging words. It goes on increasing whilst\r\nwaiting for vengeance. We find him next with the Volscian army before\r\nRome. His friends kneel before him, he lets them kneel. Old Menenius,\r\nwho had loved him as a son, only comes now to be driven away. \"Wife,\r\nmother, child, I know not.\"[700] He knows not himself. For this strength\r\nof hating in a noble heart is the same as the force of loving. He has\r\ntransports of tenderness as of rage, and can contain himself no more in\r\njoy than in grief. He runs, spite of his resolution, to his wife's arms;\r\nhe bends his knee before his mother. He had summoned the Volscian chiefs\r\nto make them witnesses of his refusals; and before them, he grants all,\r\nand weeps. On his return to Corioli, an insulting word from Aufidius\r\nmaddens him, and drives him upon the daggers of the Volscians. Vices and\r\nvirtues, glory and misery, greatness and feebleness, the unbridled\r\npassion which composes his nature, endowed him with all.\r\n\r\nIf the life of Coriolanus is the history of a mood, that of Macbeth is\r\nthe history of a monomania. The witches' prophecy has sunk into his mind\r\nat once, like a fixed idea. Gradually this idea corrupts the rest, and\r\ntransforms the whole man. He is haunted by it; he forgets the thanes who\r\nsurround him and \"who stay upon his leisure\"; he already sees in the\r\nfuture an indistinct chaos of images of blood:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... Why do I yield to that suggestion\r\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair\r\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs?...\r\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\r\nShakes so my single state of man that function\r\nIs smother'd in surmise, and nothing is\r\nBut what is not.\"[701]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the language of hallucination. Macbeth's hallucination becomes\r\ncomplete when his wife has persuaded him to assassinate the king. He\r\nsees in the air a blood-stained dagger, \"in form as palpable, as this\r\nwhich now I draw.\" His whole brain is filled with grand and terrible\r\nphantoms, which the mind of a common murderer could never have\r\nconceived: the poetry of which indicates a generous heart, enslaved to\r\nan idea of fate, and capable of remorse:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... Now o'er the one half world\r\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\r\nThe curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates\r\nPale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,\r\nAlarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,\r\nWhose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\r\nWith Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design\r\nMoves like a ghost.... (_A bell rings._)\r\nI go, and it is done; the bell invites me.\r\nHear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell\r\nThat summons thee to heaven or to hell.\"[702]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe has done the deed, and returns tottering, haggard, like a drunken\r\nman. He is horrified at his bloody hands, \"these hangman's hands.\"\r\nNothing now can cleanse them. The whole ocean might sweep over them, but\r\nthey would keep the hue of murder. \"What hands are here? ha, they pluck\r\nout mine eyes!\" He is disturbed by a word which the sleeping\r\nchamberlains uttered:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One cried, 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;\r\nAs they had seen me with these hangman's hands.\r\nListening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'\r\nWhen they did say, 'God bless us!'...\r\nBut wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen!'\r\nI had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'\r\nStuck in my throat.\"[703]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen comes a strange dream; a frightful vision of the punishment that\r\nawaits him descends upon him.\r\n\r\nAbove the beating of his heart, the tingling of the blood which seethes\r\nin his brain, he had heard them cry:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Sleep no more!\r\nMacbeth does murder sleep,' the innocent sleep,\r\nSleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,\r\nThe death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,\r\nBalm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\r\nChief nourisher in life's feast.\"[704]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the voice, like an angel's trumpet, calls him by all his titles:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor\r\nShall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more!'\"[705]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis idea, incessantly repeated, beats in his brain, with monotonous and\r\nquick strokes, like the tongue of a bell. Insanity begins; all the force\r\nof his mind is occupied by keeping before him, in spite of himself, the\r\nimage of the man whom he has murdered in his sleep:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. (_Knock._)\r\nWake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!\"[706]\r\n\r\n\r\nThenceforth, in the rare intervals in which the fever of his mind is\r\nassuaged, he is like a man worn out by a long malady. It is the sad\r\nprostration of maniacs worn out by their fits of rage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Had I but died an hour before this chance,\r\nI had lived a blessed time; for from this instant\r\nThere's nothing serious in mortality:\r\nAll is but toys: renown and grace is dead;\r\nThe wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees\r\nIs left this vault to brag of.\"[707]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen rest has restored force to the human machine, the fixed idea shakes\r\nhim again, and drives him onward, like a pitiless horseman, who has left\r\nhis panting horse only for a moment, to leap again into the saddle, and\r\nspur him over precipices. The more he has done, the more he must do:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am in blood\r\nStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,\r\nReturning were as tedious as go o'er...\"[708]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe kills in order to preserve the fruit of his murders. The fatal\r\ncirclet of gold attracts him like a magic jewel; and he beats down, from\r\na sort of blind instinct, the heads, which he sees between the crown and\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,\r\nEre we will eat our meal in fear and sleep\r\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\r\nThat shake us nightly: better be with the dead,\r\nWhom we to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\r\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\r\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\r\nAfter life's fitful fever he sleeps well;\r\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\r\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,\r\nCan touch him further.\"[709]\r\n\r\n\r\nMacbeth has ordered Banquo to be murdered, and in the midst of a great\r\nfeast he is informed of the success of his plan. He smiles, and proposes\r\nBanquo's health. Suddenly, conscience-smitten, he sees the ghost of the\r\nmurdered man; for this phantom, which Shakespeare summons, is not a mere\r\nstage-trick: we feel that here the supernatural is unnecessary, and that\r\nMacbeth would create it even if hell would not send it. With muscles\r\ntwitching, dilated eyes, his mouth half open with deadly terror, he sees\r\nit shake its bloody head, and cries with that hoarse voice, which is\r\nonly to be heard in maniacs' cells:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Prithee, see there? Behold! look! lo! how say you?\r\nWhy, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.\r\nIf charnel-houses and our graves must send\r\nThose that we bury back, our monuments\r\nShall be the maws of kites....\r\nBlood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,...\r\nAy, and since too, murders have been perform'd\r\nToo terrible for the ear: the times have been,\r\nThat, when the brains were out, the man would die,\r\nAnd there an end; but now they rise again,\r\nWith twenty mortal murders on their crowns,\r\nAnd push us from our stools:...\r\nAvaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\r\nThy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\r\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\r\nWhich thou dost glare with!\"[710]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis body trembling like that of an epileptic, his teeth clenched,\r\nfoaming at the mouth, he sinks on the ground, his limbs writhe, shaken\r\nwith convulsive quiverings, whilst a dull sob swells his panting breast,\r\nand dies in his swollen throat. What joy can remain for a man beset by\r\nsuch visions? The wide dark country, which he surveys from his towering\r\ncastle, is but a field of death, haunted by ominous apparitions;\r\nScotland, which he is depopulating, a cemetery,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where... the dead man's knell\r\nIs there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives\r\nExpire before the flowers in their caps.\r\nDying or ere they sicken.\"[711]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis soul is \"full of scorpions.\" He has \"supp'd full with horrors,\" and\r\nthe loathsome odor of blood has disgusted him with all else. He goes\r\nstumbling over the corpses which he has heaped up, with the mechanical\r\nand desperate smile of a maniac-murderer. Thenceforth death, life, all\r\nis one to him; the habit of murder has placed him out of the pale of\r\nhumanity. They tell him that his wife is dead:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Macbeth._ She should have died hereafter;\r\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\r\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\r\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day\r\nTo the last syllable of recorded time,\r\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\r\nLife's but a walking shadow; a poor player\r\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\r\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\r\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\nSignifying nothing.\"[712]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remains for him the hardening of the heart in crime, the fixed\r\nbelief in destiny. Hunted down by his enemies, \"bearlike, tied to a\r\nstake,\" he fights, troubled only by the prediction of the witches, sure\r\nof being invulnerable so long as the man whom they have described does\r\nnot appear. Henceforth his thoughts dwell on a supernatural world, and\r\nto the last he walks with his eyes fixed on the dream, which has\r\npossessed him, from the first.\r\n\r\nThe history of Hamlet, like that of Macbeth, is a story of moral\r\npoisoning. Hamlet has a delicate soul, an impassioned imagination, like\r\nthat of Shakespeare. He has lived hitherto, occupied in noble studies,\r\nskilful in mental and bodily exercises, with a taste for art, loved by\r\nthe noblest father, enamored of the purest and most charming girl,\r\nconfiding, generous, not yet having perceived, from the height of the\r\nthrone to which he was born, aught but the beauty, happiness, grandeur\r\nof nature and humanity.[713] On this soul, which character and training\r\nmake more sensitive than others, misfortune suddenly falls, extreme,\r\noverwhelming of the very kind to destroy all faith and every motive for\r\naction: with one glance he has seen all the vileness of humanity; and\r\nthis insight is given him in his mother. His mind is yet intact; but\r\njudge from the violence of his style, the crudity of his exact details,\r\nthe terrible tension of the whole nervous machine, whether he has not\r\nalready one foot on the verge of madness:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O that this too, too solid flesh would melt,\r\nThaw and resolve itself into a dew!\r\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix'd\r\nHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!\r\nHow weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,\r\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\r\nFie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,\r\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\r\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\r\nBut two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:\r\nSo excellent a king,... so loving to my mother\r\nThat he might not let e'en the winds of heaven\r\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\r\n... And yet, within a month--\r\nLet me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--\r\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\r\nWith which she follow'd my poor father's body,...\r\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\r\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\r\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\r\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\r\nIt is not nor it cannot come to good!\r\nBut break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue!\"[714]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere already are contortions of thought, a beginning of hallucination,\r\nthe symptoms of what is to come after. In the middle of conversation the\r\nimage of his father rises before his mind. He thinks he sees him. How\r\nthen will it be when the \"canonised bones have burst their cerements,\"\r\n\"the sepulchre hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,\" and when the\r\nghost comes in the night, upon a high \"platform\" of land, to tell him of\r\nthe tortures of his prison of fire, and of the fratricide, who has\r\ndriven him thither? Hamlet grows faint, but grief strengthens him, and\r\nhe has a desire for living:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hold, hold, my heart;\r\nAnd you my sinews, grow not instant old,\r\nBut bear me stiffly up! Remember thee!\r\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\r\nIn this distracted globe.--Remember thee?\r\nYea, from the table of my memory\r\nI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\r\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,...\r\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live,...\r\nO villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\r\nMy tables--meet it is I set it down,\r\nThat one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;\r\nAt least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:\r\nSo, uncle, there you are.\"[715]\t(_Writing._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis convulsive outburst, this fevered writing hand, this frenzy of\r\nintentness, prelude the approach of a kind of monomania. When his\r\nfriends come up, he treats them with the speeches of a child or an\r\nidiot. He is no longer master of his words; hollow phrases whirl in his\r\nbrain, and fall from his mouth as in a dream. They call him; he answers\r\nby imitating the cry of a sportsman whistling to his falcon: \"Hillo, ho,\r\nho, boy! come, bird, come.\" Whilst he is in the act of swearing them to\r\nsecrecy, the ghost below repeats \"Swear.\" Hamlet cries, with a nervous\r\nexcitement and a fitful gayety:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?\r\nCome on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--\r\nConsent to swear....\r\n_Ghost_ (_beneath_). Swear.\r\n_Hamlet. Hic et ubique?_ then we'll shift our ground.\r\nCome hither, gentlemen.... Swear by my sword.\r\n_Ghost_ (_beneath_). Swear.\r\n_Ham._ Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?\r\nA worthy pioneer!\"[716]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstand that as he says this his teeth chatter, \"pale as his shirt,\r\nhis knees knocking each other.\" Intense anguish ends with a kind of\r\nlaughter, which is nothing else than a spasm. Thenceforth Hamlet speaks\r\nas though he had a continuous nervous attack. His madness is feigned, I\r\nadmit; but his mind, as a door whose hinges are twisted, swings and\r\nbangs with every wind with a mad haste and with a discordant noise. He\r\nhas no need to search for the strange ideas, apparent incoherencies,\r\nexaggerations, the deluge of sarcasms which he accumulates. He finds\r\nthem within him; he does himself no violence, he simply gives himself up\r\nto himself. When he has the piece played which is to unmask his uncle,\r\nhe raises himself, lounges on the floor, lays his head in Ophelia's lap;\r\nhe addresses the actors, and comments on the piece to the spectators;\r\nhis nerves are strung, his excited thought is like a surging and\r\ncrackling flame, and cannot find fuel enough in the multitude of objects\r\nsurrounding it, upon all of which it seizes. When the king rises\r\nunmasked and troubled, Hamlet sings, and says, \"Would not this, sir, and\r\na forest of feathers--if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with\r\ntwo Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of\r\nplayers, sir!\"[717] And he laughs terribly, for he is resolved on\r\nmurder. It is clear that this state is a disease, and that the man will\r\nnot survive it.\r\n\r\nIn a soul so ardent of thought, and so mighty of feeling, what is left\r\nbut disgust and despair? We tinge all nature with the color of our\r\nthoughts; we shape the world according to our own ideas; when our soul\r\nis sick, we see nothing but sickness in the universe:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this\r\nmost excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging\r\nfirmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it\r\nappears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of\r\nvapors. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite\r\nin faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how\r\nlike an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world!\r\nthe paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of\r\ndust? man delights not me: no, nor woman neither.\"[718]\r\n\r\n\r\nHenceforth his thought sullies whatever it touches. He rails bitterly\r\nbefore Ophelia against marriage and love. Beauty! Innocence! Beauty is\r\nbut a means of prostituting innocence: \"Get thee to a nunnery: why\r\nwouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?... What should such fellows as I\r\ndo crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe\r\nnone of us.\"[719]\r\n\r\nWhen he has killed Polonius by accident, he hardly repents it; it is one\r\nfool less. He jeers lugubriously:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_King._ Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?\r\n_Hamlet._ At supper.\r\n_K._ At supper! where?\r\n_H._ Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation\r\nof politic worms are e'en at him.\"[720]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he repeats in five or six fashions these gravedigger jests. His\r\nthoughts already inhabit a churchyard; to this hopeless philosophy a\r\ngenuine man is a corpse. Public functions, honors, passions, pleasures,\r\nprojects, science, all this is but a borrowed mask, which death removes,\r\nso that people may see what we are, an evil-smelling and grinning skull.\r\nIt is this sight he goes to see by Ophelia's grave. He counts the skulls\r\nwhich the gravedigger turns up; this was a lawyer's, that a countier's.\r\nWhat bows, intrigues, pretensions, arrogance! And here now is a clown\r\nknocking it about with his spade, and playing \"at loggats with 'em.\"\r\nCæsar and Alexander have turned to clay and make the earth fat; the\r\nmasters of the world have served to \"patch a wall. Now get you to my\r\nlady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favor\r\nshe must come; make her laugh at that.\"[721] When a man has come to\r\nthis, there is nothing left but to die.\r\n\r\nThis heated imagination, which explains Hamlet's nervous disease and his\r\nmoral poisoning, explains also his conduct. If he hesitates to kill his\r\nuncle, it is not from horror of blood or from our modern scruples. He\r\nbelongs to the sixteenth century. On board ship he wrote the order to\r\nbehead Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and to do so without giving them\r\n\"shriving-time.\" He killed Polonius, he caused Ophelia's death, and has\r\nno great remorse for it. If for once he spared his uncle, it was because\r\nhe found him praying, and was afraid of sending him to heaven. He\r\nthought he was killing him when he killed Polonius. What his imagination\r\nrobs him of, is the coolness and strength to go quietly and with\r\npremeditation to plunge a sword into a breast. He can only do the thing\r\non a sudden suggestion; he must have a moment of enthusiasm; he must\r\nthink the king is behind the arras, or else, seeing that he himself is\r\npoisoned, he must find his victim under his foil's point. He is not\r\nmaster of his acts; opportunity dictates them; he cannot plan a murder,\r\nbut must improvise it. A too lively imagination exhausts the will, by\r\nthe strength of images which it heaps up, and by the fury of intentness\r\nwhich absorbs it. You recognize in him a poet's soul, made not to act,\r\nbut to dream, which is lost in contemplating the phantoms of its\r\ncreation, which sees the imaginary world too clearly to play a part in\r\nthe real world; an artist whom evil chance has made a prince, whom worse\r\nchance has made an avenger of crime, and who, destined by nature for\r\ngenius, is condemned by fortune to madness and unhappiness. Hamlet is\r\nShakespeare, and, at the close of this gallery of portraits which have\r\nall some features of his own, Shakespeare has painted himself in the\r\nmost striking of all.\r\n\r\nIf Racine or Corneille had framed a psychology, they would have said,\r\nwith Descartes: Man is an incorporeal soul, served by organs, endowed\r\nwith reason and will, dwelling in palaces or porticos, made for\r\nconversation and society, whose harmonious and ideal action is developed\r\nby discourse and replies, in a world constructed by logic beyond the\r\nrealms of time and place.\r\n\r\nIf Shakespeare had framed a psychology, he would have said, with\r\nEsquirol:[722] Man is a nervous machine, governed by a mood, disposed to\r\nhallucinations, carried away by unbridled passions, essentially\r\nunreasoning, a mixture of animal and poet, having instead of mind\r\nrapture, instead of virtue sensibility, imagination for prompter and\r\nguide, and led at random, by the most determinate and complex\r\ncircumstances, to sorrow, crime, madness, and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.--Characteristics of Shakespeare's Genius\r\n\r\n\r\nCould such a poet always confine himself to the imitation of nature?\r\nWill this poetical world which is going on in his brain never break\r\nloose from the laws of the world of reality? Is he not powerful enough\r\nto follow his own laws? He is; and the poetry of Shakespeare naturally\r\nfinds an outlet in the fantastical. This is the highest grade of\r\nunreasoning and creative imagination. Despising ordinary logic, it\r\ncreates another; it unites facts and ideas in a new order, apparently\r\nabsurd, in reality regular; it lays open the land of dreams, and its\r\ndreams seem to us the truth.\r\n\r\nWhen we enter upon Shakespeare's comedies, and even his\r\nhalf-dramas,[723] it is as though we met him on the threshold, like an\r\nactor to whom the prologue is committed, to prevent misunderstanding on\r\nthe part of the public, and to tell them: \"Do not take too seriously\r\nwhat you are about to hear: I am amusing myself. My brain, being full of\r\nfancies, desired to array them, and here they are. Palaces, distant\r\nlandscapes, transparent clouds which blot in the morning the horizon\r\nwith their gray mists, the red and glorious flames into which the\r\nevening sun descends, white cloisters in endless vista through the\r\nambient air, grottos, cottages, the fantastic pageant of all human\r\npassions, the irregular sport of unlooked-for adventures--this is the\r\nmedley of forms, colors, sentiments, which I let become entangled and\r\nconfused in my presence, a many-tinted skein of glistening silks, a\r\nslender arabesque, whose sinuous curves, crossing and mingled, bewilder\r\nthe mind by the whimsical variety of their infinite complications. Don't\r\nregard it as a picture. Don't look for a precise composition, a sole and\r\nincreasing interest, the skilful management of a well-ordered and\r\ncongruous plot. I have tales and novels before me which I am cutting up\r\ninto scenes. Never mind the _finis_, I am amusing myself on the road. It\r\nis not the end of the journey which pleases me, but the journey itself.\r\nIs there any need in going so straight and quick? Do you only care to\r\nknow whether the poor merchant of Venice will escape Shylock's knife?\r\nHere are two happy lovers, seated under the palace walls on a calm\r\nnight; wouldn't you like to listen to the peaceful reverie which arises\r\nlike a perfume from the bottom of their hearts?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!\r\nHere will we sit and let the sounds of music\r\nCreep in our ears: soft stillness and the night\r\nBecome the touches of sweet harmony.\r\nSit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven\r\nIs thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:\r\nThere's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st,\r\nBut in his motion like an angel sings,\r\nStill quiring to the young-eyed cherubims;\r\nSuch harmony is in immortal souls;\r\nBut whilst this muddy vesture of decay\r\nDoth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\r\n(_Enter musicians._)\r\nCome, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn:\r\nWith sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear.\r\nAnd draw her home with music.\r\n_Jessica._ I am never merry when I hear sweet music.'\"[724]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have I not the right, when I see the big laughing face of a clownish\r\nservant, to stop near him, see him gesticulate, frolic, gossip, go\r\nthrough his hundred pranks and his hundred grimaces, and treat myself to\r\nthe comedy of his spirit and gayety? Two fine gentlemen pass by. I hear\r\nthe rolling fire of their metaphors, and I follow their skirmish of wit.\r\nHere in a corner is the artless arch face of a young wench. Do you\r\nforbid me to linger by her, to watch her smiles, her sudden blushes, the\r\nchildish pout of her rosy lips, the coquetry of her pretty motions? You\r\nare in a great hurry if the prattle of this fresh and musical voice\r\ncan't stop you. Is it no pleasure to view this succession of sentiments\r\nand faces? Is your fancy so dull that you must have the mighty mechanism\r\nof a geometrical plot to shake it? My sixteenth century playgoers were\r\neasier to move. A sunbeam that had lost its way on an old wall, a\r\nfoolish song thrown into the middle of a drama, occupied their mind as\r\nwell as the blackest of catastrophes. After the horrible scene in which\r\nShylock brandished his butcher's knife before Antonio's bare breast,\r\nthey saw just as willingly the petty household wrangle, and the amusing\r\nbit of raillery which ends the piece. Like soft moving water, their soul\r\nrose and sank in an instant to the level of the poet's emotion, and\r\ntheir sentiments readily flowed in the bed he had prepared for them.\r\nThey let him stray here and there on his journey, and did not forbid him\r\nto make two voyages at once. They allowed several plots in one. If but\r\nthe slightest thread united them it was sufficient. Lorenzo eloped with\r\nJessica, Shylock was frustrated in his revenge, Portia's suitors failed\r\nin the test imposed upon them; Portia, disguised as a doctor of laws,\r\ntook from her husband the ring which he had promised never to part with;\r\nthese three or four comedies, disunited, mingled, were shuffled and\r\nunfolded together, like an unknotted skein in which threads of a hundred\r\ncolors are entwined. Together with diversity, my spectators allowed\r\nimprobability. Comedy is a slight winged creature, which flutters from\r\ndream to dream, whose wings you would break if you held it captive in\r\nthe narrow prison of common-sense. Do not press its fictions too hard;\r\ndo not probe their contents. Let them float before your eyes like a\r\ncharming swift dream. Let the fleeting apparition plunge back into the\r\nbright misty land from whence it came. For an instant it deluded you;\r\nlet it suffice. It is sweet to leave the world of realities behind you;\r\nthe mind rests amidst impossibilities. We are happy when delivered from\r\nthe rough chains of logic, to wander amongst strange adventures, to live\r\nin sheer romance, and know that we are living there. I do not try to\r\ndeceive you, and make you believe in the world where I take you. A man\r\nmust disbelieve it in order to enjoy it. We must give ourselves up to\r\nillusion, and feel that we are giving ourselves up to it. We must smile\r\nas we listen. We smile in \"The Winter's Tale\" when Hermione descends\r\nfrom her pedestal, and when, Leontes discovers his wife in the statue,\r\nhaving believed her to be dead. We smile in \"Cymbeline\" when we see the\r\nlone cavern in which the young princes have lived like savage hunters.\r\nImprobability deprives emotions of their sting. The events interest or\r\ntouch us without making us suffer. At the very moment when sympathy is\r\ntoo intense, we remind ourselves that it is all a fancy. They become\r\nlike distant objects, whose distance softens their outline, and wraps\r\nthem in a luminous veil of blue air. Your true comedy is an opera. We\r\nlisten to sentiments without thinking too much of plot. We follow the\r\ntender or gay melodies without reflecting that they interrupt the\r\naction. We dream elsewhere on hearing music; here I bid you dream on\r\nhearing verse.\"\r\n\r\nThen the speaker of the prologue retires, and the actors come on.\r\n\r\n\"As You Like It\" is a caprice.[725] Action there is none; interest\r\nbarely; likelihood still less. And the whole is charming. Two cousins,\r\nprinces' daughters, come to a forest with a court clown, Celia disguised\r\nas a shepherdess, Rosalind as a boy. They find here the old duke,\r\nRosalind's father, who, driven out of his duchy, lives with his friends\r\nlike a philosopher and a hunter. They find amorous shepherds, who with\r\nsongs and prayers pursue intractable shepherdesses. They discover or\r\nthey meet with lovers who become their husbands. Suddenly it is\r\nannounced that the wicked Duke Frederick, who had usurped the crown, has\r\njust retired to a cloister, and restored the throne to the old exiled\r\nduke. Everyone gets married, everyone dances, everything ends with a\r\n\"rustic revelry.\" Where is the pleasantness of these puerilities? First,\r\nthe fact of its being puerile; the absence of the serious is refreshing;\r\nThere are no events, and there is no plot. We gently follow the easy\r\ncurrent of graceful or melancholy emotions, which takes us away and\r\nmoves us about without wearying. The place adds to the illusion and\r\ncharm. It is an autumn forest, in which the sultry rays permeate the\r\nblushing oak leaves, or the half-stripped, ashes tremble and smile to\r\nthe feeble breath of evening. The lovers wander by brooks that \"brawl\"\r\nunder antique roots. As you listen to them you see the slim birches,\r\nwhose cloak of lace grows glossy under the slant rays of the sun that\r\ngilds them, and the thoughts wander down the mossy vistas in which their\r\nfootsteps are not heard. What better place could be chosen for the\r\ncomedy of sentiment and the play of heart-fancies? Is not this a fit\r\nspot in which to listen to love-talk? Someone has seen Orlando,\r\nRosalind's lover, in this glade; she hears it and blushes. \"Alas the\r\nday!... What did he, when thou sawest him? What said he? How looked he?\r\nWherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains\r\nhe? How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see him again?\" Then,\r\nwith a lower voice, somewhat hesitating: \"Looks he as freshly as he did\r\nthe day he wrestled?\" She is not yet exhausted: \"Do you not know I am a\r\nwoman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.\"[726] One question\r\nfollows another, she closes the mouth of her friend, who is ready to\r\nanswer. At every word she jests, but agitated, blushing, with a forced\r\ngayety; her bosom heaves, and her heart beats. Nevertheless she is\r\ncalmer when Orlando comes; bandies words with him; sheltered under her\r\ndisguise, she makes him confess that he loves Rosalind. Then she plagues\r\nhim, like the frolic, the wag, the coquette she is. \"Why, how now,\r\nOrlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover?\" Orlando\r\nrepeats that he loves Rosalind, and she pleases herself by making him\r\nrepeat it more than once. She sparkles with wit, jests, mischievous\r\npranks; pretty fits of anger, feigned sulks, bursts of laughter,\r\ndeafening babble, engaging caprices. \"Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am\r\nin a holiday humor, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me\r\nnow, an I were your very, very Rosalind?\" And every now and then she\r\nrepeats with an arch smile, \"And I am your Rosalind; am I not your\r\nRosalind?\"[727] Orlando protests that he would die. Die! Who ever\r\nthought of dying for love? Leander? He took one bath too many in the\r\nHellespont; so poets have said he died for love. Troilus? A Greek broke\r\nhis head with a club; so poets have said he died for love. Come, come,\r\nRosalind will be softer. And then she plays at marriage with him, and\r\nmakes Celia pronounce the solemn words. She irritates and torments her\r\npretended husband; tells him all the whims she means to indulge in, all\r\nthe pranks she will play, all the teasing he will have to endure. The\r\nretorts come one after another like fireworks. At every phrase we follow\r\nthe looks of these sparkling eyes, the curves of this laughing mouth,\r\nthe quick movements of this supple figure. It is a bird's petulance and\r\nvolubility. \"O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know\r\nhow many fathom deep I am in love.\" Then she provokes her cousin Celia,\r\nsports with her hair, calls her by every woman's name. Antitheses\r\nwithout end, words all a-jumble, quibbles, pretty exaggerations,\r\nword-racket; as you listen, you fancy it is the warbling of a\r\nnightingale. The trill of repeated metaphors, the melodious roll of the\r\npoetical gamut, the summer-warbling rustling under the foliage, change\r\nthe piece into a veritable opera. The three lovers end by chanting a\r\nsort of trio. The first throws out a fancy, the others take it up. Four\r\ntimes this strophe is renewed; and the symmetry of ideas, added to the\r\njingle of the rhymes, makes of a dialogue a concerto of love:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Phebe._ Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.\r\n_Silvius._ It is to be all made of sighs and tears;\r\nAnd so am I for Phebe.\r\n_P._ And I for Ganymede.\r\n_Orlando._ And I for Rosalind.\r\n_Rosalind._ And I for no woman....\r\n_S._ It is to be all made of fantasy,\r\nAll made of passion, and all made of wishes,\r\nAll adoration, duty, and observance,\r\nAll humbleness, all patience and impatience,\r\nAll purity, all trial, all observance;\r\nAnd so I am for Phebe.\r\n_P._ And so am I for Ganymede.\r\n_O._ And so am I for Rosalind.\r\n_R._ And so am I for no woman.\"[728]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessity of singing is so urgent that a minute later songs break\r\nout of themselves. The prose and the conversation end in lyric poetry.\r\nWe pass straight on into these odes. We do not find ourselves in a new\r\ncountry. We feel the emotion and foolish gayety as if it were a holiday.\r\nWe see the graceful couple whom the song of the two pages brings before\r\nus, passing in the misty light \"o'er the green corn-field,\" amid the hum\r\nof sportive insects, on the finest day of the flowering spring-time.\r\nUnlikelihood grows natural, and we are not astonished when we see Hymen\r\nleading the two brides by the hand to give them to their husbands.\r\n\r\nWhilst the young folk sing, the old folk talk. Their life also is a\r\nnovel, but a sad one. Shakespeare's delicate soul, bruised by the shocks\r\nof social life, took refuge in contemplations of solitary life. To\r\nforget the strife and annoyances of the world, he must bury himself in a\r\nwide silent forest, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Under the shade of melancholy boughs,\r\nLoose and neglect the creeping hours of time.\"[729]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe look at the bright images which the sun carves on the white\r\nbeech-boles, the shade of trembling leaves flickering on the thick moss,\r\nthe long waves of the summit of the trees; then the sharp sting of care\r\nis blunted; we suffer no more, simply remembering that we suffered once;\r\nwe feel nothing but a gentle misanthropy, and being renewed, we are the\r\nbetter for it. The old duke is happy in his exile. Solitude has given\r\nhim rest, delivered him from flattery, reconciled him to nature. He\r\npities the stags which he is obliged to hunt for food:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come, shall we go and kill us venison?\r\nAnd yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,\r\nBeing native burghers of this desert city,\r\nShould in their own confines with forked heads\r\nHave their round haunches gored.\"[730]\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing sweeter than this mixture of tender compassion, dreamy\r\nphilosophy, delicate sadness, poetical complaints, and rustic songs. One\r\nof the lords sings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\r\nThou art not so unkind\r\nAs man's ingratitude;\r\nThy tooth is not so keen,\r\nBecause thou art not seen,\r\nAlthough thy breath be rude.\r\nHeigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:\r\nMost friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:\r\nThen, heigh-ho, the holly!\r\nThis life is most jolly.\"[731]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst these lords is found a soul that suffers more, Jacques the\r\nmelancholy, one of Shakespeare's best-loved characters, a transparent\r\nmask behind which we perceive the face of the poet. He is sad because he\r\nis tender; he feels the contact of things too keenly, and what leaves\r\nothers indifferent, makes him weep.[732] He does not scold, he is sad;\r\nhe does not reason, he is moved; he has not the combative spirit of a\r\nreforming moralist; his soul is sick and weary of life. Impassioned\r\nimagination leads quickly to disgust. Like opium, it excites and\r\nshatters. It leads man to the loftiest philosophy, then lets him down to\r\nthe whims of a child. Jacques leaves other men abruptly, and goes to the\r\nquiet nooks to be alone. He loves his sadness, and would not exchange it\r\nfor joy. Meeting Orlando, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Rosalind is your love's name?\r\n_Orlando._ Yes, just.\r\n_Jacques._ I do not like her name.\"[733]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe has the fancies of a nervous woman. He is scandalized because Orlando\r\nwrites sonnets on the forest trees. He is eccentric, and finds subjects\r\nof grief and gayety where others would see nothing of the sort:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,\r\nA motley fool; a miserable world!\r\nAs I do live by food, I met a fool;\r\nWho laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\r\nAnd rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\r\nIn good set terms and yet a motley fool....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJacques hearing him moralize in such a manner begins to laugh \"sans\r\nintermission\" that a fool could be so meditative:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O noble fool; a worthy fool! Motley's the only wear....\r\nO that I were a fool!\r\nI am ambitious for a motley coat.\"[734]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next minute he returns to his melancholy dissertations, bright\r\npictures whose vivacity explains his character, and betrays Shakespeare,\r\nhiding under his name:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All the world's a stage,\r\nAnd all the men and women merely players:\r\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\r\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,\r\nHis acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\r\nMewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\r\nAnd then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel,\r\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail\r\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,\r\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\r\nMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\r\nFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\r\nJealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,\r\nSeeking the bubble reputation\r\nEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\r\nIn fair round belly with good capon lined,\r\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\r\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\r\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\r\nInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\r\nWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\r\nHis youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\r\nFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\r\nTurning again toward childish treble, pipes\r\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\r\nThat ends this strange eventful history,\r\nIn second childishness and mere oblivion,\r\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\"[735]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As you Like it\" is a half dream. \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" is a\r\ncomplete one.\r\n\r\nThe scene, buried in the far-off mist of fabulous antiquity, carries us\r\nback to Theseus, Duke of Athens, who is preparing his palace for his\r\nmarriage with the beautiful queen of the Amazons. The style, loaded with\r\ncontorted images, fills the mind with strange and splendid visions, and\r\nthe airy elf-world divert the comedy into the fairy-land from whence it\r\nsprung.\r\n\r\nLove is still the theme: of all sentiments, is it not the greatest\r\nfancy-weaver? But love is not heard here in the charming, prattle of\r\nRosalind; it is glaring, like the season of the year. It does not brim\r\nover in slight conversations, in supple and skipping prose; it breaks\r\nforth into big rhyming odes, dressed in magnificent metaphors, sustained\r\nby impassioned accents, such as a warm night, odorous and star-spangled,\r\ninspires in a poet and a lover. Lysander and Hermia agree to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Lysander._ To-morrow night when Phoebe doth behold\r\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\r\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,\r\nA time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,\r\nThrough Athens' gates have we devised to steal.\r\n_Hermia._ And in the wood, where often you and I\r\nUpon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie....\r\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet.\"[736]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey get lost, and fall asleep, wearied, under the trees. Puck squeezes\r\nin the youth's eyes the juice of a magic flower, and changes his heart.\r\nPresently, when he awakes, he will become enamored of the first woman he\r\nsees. Meanwhile Demetrius, Hermia's rejected lover, wanders with Helena,\r\nwhom he rejects, in the solitary wood. The magic flower changes him in\r\nturn, he now loves Helena. The lovers flee and pursue one another,\r\nbeneath the lofty trees, in the calm night. We smile at their\r\ntransports, their complaints, their ecstasies, and yet we join in them.\r\nThis passion is a dream, and yet it moves us: It is like those airy webs\r\nwhich we find at morning on the crest of the hedgerows where the dew has\r\nspread them, and whose weft sparkles like a jewel-casket. Nothing can be\r\nmore fragile, and nothing more graceful. The poet sports with emotions;\r\nhe mingles, confuses, redoubles, interweaves them; he twines and\r\nuntwines these loves like the mazes of a dance, and we see the noble and\r\ntender figures pass by the verdant bushes, beneath the radiant eyes of\r\nthe stars, now wet with tears, now bright with rapture. They have the\r\nabandonment of true love, not the grossness of sensual love. Nothing\r\ncauses us to fall from the ideal world in which Shakespeare conducts us.\r\nDazzled by beauty, they adore it, and the spectacle of their happiness,\r\ntheir emotion, and their tenderness, is a kind of enchantment.\r\n\r\nAbove these two couples flutters and hums the swarm of elves and\r\nfairies. They also love. Titania, their queen, has a young boy for her\r\nfavorite, son of an Indian king, of whom Oberon, her husband, wishes to\r\ndeprive her. They quarrel, so that the elves creep for fear into the\r\nacorn cups, in the golden primroses. Oberon, by way of vengeance,\r\ntouches Titania's sleeping eyes with the magic flower, and thus on\r\nwaking the nimblest and most charming of the fairies finds herself\r\nenamored of a stupid blockhead with an ass's head. She kneels before\r\nhim; she sets on his \"hairy temples a coronet of fresh and fragrant\r\nflowers\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And that same dew, which sometime on the buds\r\nWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,\r\nStood now within the pretty floweret's eyes,\r\nLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail.\"[737]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe calls round her all her fairy attendants;\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;\r\nHop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes;\r\nFeed him with apricocks and dewberries,\r\nWith purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;\r\nThe honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,\r\nAnd for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs\r\nAnd light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,\r\nTo have my love to bed and to arise;\r\nAnd pluck the wings from painted butterflies\r\nTo fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes....\r\nCome, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.\r\nThe moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye;\r\nAnd when she weeps, weeps every little flower,\r\nLamenting some enforced chastity.\r\nTie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.\"[738]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, for her love brayed horribly, and to all the offers of\r\nTitania, replied with a petition for hay. What can be sadder and sweeter\r\nthan this irony of Shakespeare? What raillery against love, and what\r\ntenderness for love! The sentiment is divine; its object unworthy. The\r\nheart is ravished, the eyes blind. It is a golden butterfly, fluttering\r\nin the mud; and Shakespeare, whilst painting its misery, preserves all\r\nits beauty:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,\r\nWhile I thy amiable cheeks do coy,\r\nAnd stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,\r\nAnd kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy....\r\nSleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms....\r\nSo doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle\r\nGently entwist; the female ivy so\r\nEnrings the barky fingers of the elm.\r\nO, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!\"[739]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the return of morning, when\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The eastern gate, all fiery red,\r\nOpening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,\r\nTurns into yellow gold his salt green streams,\"[740]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe enchantment ceases, Titania awakes on her couch of wild thyme and\r\ndrooping violets. She drives the monster away; her recollections of the\r\nnight are effaced in a vague twilight:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These things seem small and undistinguishable,\r\nLike far-off mountains turned into clouds.\"[741]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the fairies\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Go seek some dew drops here\r\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.\"[742]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is Shakespeare's fantasy, a slight tissue of bold inventions, of\r\nardent passions, melancholy mockery, dazzling poetry, such as one of\r\nTitania's elves would have made. Nothing could be more like the poet's\r\nmind than these nimble genii, children of air and flame, whose flights\r\n\"compass the globe\" in a second, who glide over the foam of the waves\r\nand skip between the atoms of the winds. Ariel flies, an invisible\r\nsongster, around shipwrecked men to console them, discovers the thoughts\r\nof traitors, pursues the savage beast Caliban, spreads gorgeous visions\r\nbefore lovers, and does all in a lightning-flash:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\r\nIn a cowslip's bell I lie....\r\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\r\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough....\r\nI drink the air before me, and return\r\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.\"[743]\r\n\r\n\r\nShakespeare glides over things on as swift a wing, by leaps as sudden,\r\nwith a touch as delicate.\r\n\r\nWhat a soul! what extent of action, and what sovereignty of an unique\r\nfaculty! what diverse creations, and what persistence of the same\r\nimpress! There they all are united, and all marked by the same sign,\r\nvoid of will and reason, governed by mood, imagination, or pure passion,\r\ndestitute of the faculties contrary to those of the poet, dominated by\r\nthe corporeal type which his painter's eyes have conceived, endowed by\r\nthe habits of mind and by the vehement sensibility which he finds in\r\nhimself.[744] Go through the groups, and you will only discover in them\r\ndivers forms and divers states of the same power. Here, a herd of\r\nbrutes, dotards, and gossips, made up of a mechanical imagination;\r\nfurther on, a company of men of wit, animated by a gay and foolish\r\nimagination; then, a charming swarm of women whom their delicate\r\nimagination raises so high, and their self-forgetting love carries so\r\nfar; elsewhere a band of villains, hardened by unbridled passions,\r\ninspired by artistic rapture; in the centre a mournful train of grand\r\ncharacters, whose excited brain is filled with sad or criminal visions,\r\nand whom an inner destiny urges to murder, madness, or death. Ascend one\r\nstage, and contemplate the whole scene: the aggregate bears the same\r\nmark as the details. The drama reproduces promiscuously uglinesses,\r\nbasenesses, horrors, unclean details, profligate and ferocious manners,\r\nthe whole reality of life just as it is, when it is unrestrained by\r\ndecorum, common-sense, reason, and duty. Comedy, led through a\r\nphantasmagoria of pictures, gets lost in the likely and the unlikely,\r\nwith no other connection but the caprice of an amused imagination,\r\nwantonly disjointed and romantic, an opera without music, a concerto of\r\nmelancholy and tender sentiments, which bears the mind into the\r\nsupernatural world, and brings before our eyes on its fairy-wings the\r\ngenius which has created it. Look now. Do you not see the poet behind\r\nthe crowd of his creations? They have heralded his approach. They have\r\nall shown somewhat of him. Ready, impetuous, impassioned, delicate, his\r\ngenius is pure imagination, touched more vividly and by slighter things\r\nthan ours. Hence his style, blooming with exuberant images, loaded with\r\nexaggerated metaphors, whose strangeness is like incoherence, whose\r\nwealth is superabundant, the work of a mind, which, at the least\r\nincitement, produces too much and takes too wide leaps. Hence this\r\ninvoluntary psychology, and this terrible penetration, which\r\ninstantaneously perceiving all the effects of a situation, and all the\r\ndetails of a character, concentrates them in every response, and gives\r\nto a figure a relief and a coloring which create illusion. Hence our\r\nemotion and tenderness. We say to him, as Desdemona to Othello: \"I love\r\nthee for the battles, sieges, fortunes thou hast passed, and for the\r\ndistressful stroke that thy youth suffered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: Halliwell's \"Life of Shakespeare.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: Born 1564, died 1616.
