On\r\nnumerous obscure points of psychiatry, criminal law, politics, and\r\nsociology, you have poured a veritable flood of light, which those\r\nalone have not perceived who obdurately close their eyes, or who are\r\ntoo short-sighted to derive benefit from any enlightenment whatsoever._\r\n\r\n_But there is a vast and important domain into which neither you nor\r\nyour disciples have hitherto borne the torch of your method--the domain\r\nof art and literature._\r\n\r\n_Degenerates are not always criminals, prostitutes, anarchists, and\r\npronounced lunatics; they are often authors and artists. These,\r\nhowever, manifest the same mental characteristics, and for the most\r\npart the same somatic features, as the members of the above-mentioned\r\nanthropological family, who satisfy their unhealthy impulses with the\r\nknife of the assassin or the bomb of the dynamiter, instead of with pen\r\nand pencil._\r\n\r\n_Some among these degenerates in literature, music, and painting have\r\nin recent years come into extraordinary prominence, and are revered by\r\nnumerous admirers as creators of a new art, and heralds of the coming\r\ncenturies._\r\n\r\n_This phenomenon is not to be disregarded. Books and works of art\r\nexercise a powerful suggestion on the masses. It is from these\r\nproductions that an age derives its ideals of morality and beauty. If\r\nthey are absurd and anti-social, they exert a disturbing and corrupting\r\ninfluence on the views of a whole generation. Hence the latter,\r\nespecially the impressionable youth, easily excited to enthusiasm for\r\nall that is strange and seemingly new, must be warned and enlightened\r\nas to the real nature of the creations so blindly admired. This warning\r\nthe ordinary critic does not give. Exclusively literary and æsthetic\r\nculture is, moreover, the worst preparation conceivable for a true\r\nknowledge of the pathological character of the works of degenerates.\r\nThe verbose rhetorician exposes with more or less grace, or cleverness,\r\nthe subjective impressions received from the works he criticises,\r\nbut is incapable of judging if these works are the productions of\r\na shattered brain, and also the nature of the mental disturbance\r\nexpressing itself by them._\r\n\r\n_Now I have undertaken the work of investigating (as much as possible\r\nafter your method), the tendencies of the fashions in art and\r\nliterature; of proving that they have their source in the degeneracy\r\nof their authors, and that the enthusiasm of their admirers is for\r\nmanifestations of more or less pronounced moral insanity, imbecility,\r\nand dementia._\r\n\r\n_Thus, this book is an attempt at a really scientific criticism, which\r\ndoes not base its judgment of a book upon the purely accidental,\r\ncapricious and variable emotions it awakens--emotions depending on\r\nthe temperament and mood of the individual reader--but upon the\r\npsycho-physiological elements from which it sprang. At the same time it\r\nventures to fill a void still existing in your powerful system._\r\n\r\n_I have no doubt as to the consequences to myself of my initiative.\r\nThere is at the present day no danger in attacking the Church, for\r\nit no longer has the stake at its disposal. To write against rulers\r\nand governments is likewise nothing venturesome, for at the worst\r\nnothing more than imprisonment could follow, with compensating glory\r\nof martyrdom. But grievous is the fate of him who has the audacity to\r\ncharacterize æsthetic fashions as forms of mental decay. The author or\r\nartist attacked never pardons a man for recognising in him a lunatic\r\nor a charlatan; the subjectively garrulous critics are furious when it\r\nis pointed out how shallow and incompetent they are, or how cowardly\r\nin swimming with the stream; and even the public is angered when\r\nforced to see that it has been running after fools, quack dentists,\r\nand mountebanks, as so many prophets. Now, the graphomaniacs and their\r\ncritical bodyguard dominate nearly the entire press, and in the latter\r\npossess an instrument of torture by which, in Indian fashion, they can\r\nrack the troublesome spoiler of sport, to his life’s end._\r\n\r\n_The danger, however, to which he exposes himself cannot deter a man\r\nfrom doing that which he regards as his duty. When a scientific truth\r\nhas been discovered, he owes it to humanity, and has no right to\r\nwithhold it. Moreover, it is as little possible to do this as for a\r\nwoman voluntarily to prevent the birth of the mature fruit of her womb._\r\n\r\n_Without aspiring to the most distant comparison of myself with you,\r\none of the loftiest mental phenomena of the century, I may yet take for\r\nmy example the smiling serenity with which you pursue your own way,\r\nindifferent to ingratitude, insult, and misunderstanding._\r\n\r\n_Pray remain, dear and honoured master, ever favourably disposed\r\ntowards your gratefully devoted_\r\n\r\n      _MAX NORDAU_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK I.\r\n\r\n  _FIN-DE-SIÈCLE._\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\n  THE DUSK OF THE NATIONS                                  1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE SYMPTOMS                                             7\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  DIAGNOSIS                                               15\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  ETIOLOGY                                                34\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK II.\r\n\r\n  _MYSTICISM._\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MYSTICISM                             45\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE PRE-RAPHAELITES                                     67\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  SYMBOLISM      100\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  TOLSTOISM                                              144\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  THE RICHARD WAGNER CULT                                171\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  PARODIES OF MYSTICISM                                  214\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK III.\r\n\r\n  _EGO-MANIA._\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EGO-MANIA                            241\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  PARNASSIANS AND DIABOLISTS                             266\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  DECADENTS AND ÆSTHETES                                 296\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  IBSENISM                                               338\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE                                    415\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK IV.\r\n\r\n  _REALISM._\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  ZOLA AND HIS SCHOOL                                    473\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE ‘YOUNG GERMAN’ PLAGIARISTS                         506\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK V.\r\n\r\n  _THE TWENTIETH CENTURY._\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  PROGNOSIS                                              536\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THERAPEUTICS                                           550\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DEGENERATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n_FIN-DE-SIÈCLE_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DUSK OF THE NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIN-DE-SIÈCLE is a name covering both what is characteristic of many\r\nmodern phenomena, and also the underlying mood which in them finds\r\nexpression. Experience has long shown that an idea usually derives\r\nits designation from the language of the nation which first formed\r\nit. This, indeed, is a law of constant application when historians of\r\nmanners and customs inquire into language, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nsome notion, through the origins of some verbal root, respecting the\r\nhome of the earliest inventions and the line of evolution in different\r\nhuman races. _Fin-de-siècle_ is French, for it was in France that the\r\nmental state so entitled was first consciously realized. The word has\r\nflown from one hemisphere to the other, and found its way into all\r\ncivilized languages. A proof this that the need of it existed. The\r\n_fin-de-siècle_ state of mind is to-day everywhere to be met with;\r\nnevertheless, it is in many cases a mere imitation of a foreign fashion\r\ngaining vogue, and not an organic evolution. It is in the land of its\r\nbirth that it appears in its most genuine form, and Paris is the right\r\nplace in which to observe its manifold expressions.\r\n\r\nNo proof is needed of the extreme silliness of the term. Only the\r\nbrain of a child or of a savage could form the clumsy idea that the\r\ncentury is a kind of living being, born like a beast or a man, passing\r\nthrough all the stages of existence, gradually ageing and declining\r\nafter blooming childhood, joyous youth, and vigorous maturity, to die\r\nwith the expiration of the hundredth year, after being afflicted in\r\nits last decade with all the infirmities of mournful senility. Such\r\na childish anthropomorphism or zoomorphism never stops to consider\r\nthat the arbitrary division of time, rolling ever continuously along,\r\nis not identical amongst all civilized beings, and that while this\r\nnineteenth century of Christendom is held to be a creature reeling to\r\nits death presumptively in dire exhaustion, the fourteenth century of\r\nthe Mahommedan world is tripping along in the baby-shoes of its first\r\ndecade, and the fifteenth century of the Jews strides gallantly by in\r\nthe full maturity of its fifty-second year. Every day on our globe\r\n130,000 human beings are born, for whom the world begins with this same\r\nday, and the young citizen of the world is neither feebler nor fresher\r\nfor leaping into life in the midst of the death-throes of 1900, nor on\r\nthe birthday of the twentieth century. But it is a habit of the human\r\nmind to project externally its own subjective states. And it is in\r\naccordance with this naïvely egoistic tendency that the French ascribe\r\ntheir own senility to the century, and speak of _fin-de-siècle_ when\r\nthey ought correctly to say _fin-de-race_.[1]\r\n\r\nBut however silly a term _fin-de-siècle_ may be, the mental\r\nconstitution which it indicates is actually present in influential\r\ncircles. The disposition of the times is curiously confused, a compound\r\nof feverish restlessness and blunted discouragement, of fearful presage\r\nand hang-dog renunciation. The prevalent feeling is that of imminent\r\nperdition and extinction. _Fin-de-siècle_ is at once a confession and\r\na complaint. The old Northern faith contained the fearsome doctrine\r\nof the Dusk of the Gods. In our days there have arisen in more\r\nhighly-developed minds vague qualms of a Dusk of the Nations, in which\r\nall suns and all stars are gradually waning, and mankind with all its\r\ninstitutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world.\r\n\r\nIt is not for the first time in the course of history that the horror\r\nof world-annihilation has laid hold of men’s minds. A similar sentiment\r\ntook possession of the Christian peoples at the approach of the year\r\n1000. But there is an essential difference between chiliastic panic\r\nand _fin-de-siècle_ excitement. The despair at the turn of the first\r\nmillennium of Christian chronology proceeded from a feeling of fulness\r\nof life and joy of life. Men were aware of throbbing pulses, they\r\nwere conscious of unweakened capacity for enjoyment, and found it\r\nunmitigatedly appalling to perish together with the world, when there\r\nwere yet so many flagons to drain and so many lips to kiss, and when\r\nthey could yet rejoice so vigorously in both love and wine. Of all\r\nthis in the _fin-de-siècle_ feeling there is nothing. Neither has it\r\nanything in common with the impressive twilight-melancholy of an aged\r\nFaust, surveying the work of a lifetime, and who, proud of what has\r\nbeen achieved, and contemplating what is begun but not completed, is\r\nseized with vehement desire to finish his work, and, awakened from\r\nsleep by haunting unrest, leaps up with the cry: ‘Was ich gedacht, ich\r\neil’ es zu vollbringen.’[2]\r\n\r\nQuite otherwise is the _fin-de-siècle_ mood. It is the impotent despair\r\nof a sick man, who feels himself dying by inches in the midst of an\r\neternally living nature blooming insolently for ever. It is the envy of\r\na rich, hoary voluptuary, who sees a pair of young lovers making for\r\na sequestered forest nook; it is the mortification of the exhausted\r\nand impotent refugee from a Florentine plague, seeking in an enchanted\r\ngarden the experiences of a Decamerone, but striving in vain to snatch\r\none more pleasure of sense from the uncertain hour. The reader of\r\nTurgenieff’s _A Nest of Nobles_ will remember the end of that beautiful\r\nwork. The hero, Lavretzky, comes as a man advanced in years to visit at\r\nthe house where, in his young days, he had lived his romance of love.\r\nAll is unchanged. The garden is fragrant with flowers. In the great\r\ntrees the happy birds are chirping; on the fresh turf the children romp\r\nand shout. Lavretzky alone has grown old, and contemplates, in mournful\r\nexclusion, a scene where nature holds on its joyous way, caring nought\r\nthat Lisa the beloved is vanished, and Lavretzky, a broken-down man,\r\nweary of life. Lavretzky’s admission that, amidst all this ever-young,\r\never-blooming nature, for him alone there comes no morrow; Alving’s\r\ndying cry for ‘The sun--the sun!’ in Ibsen’s _Ghosts_--these express\r\nrightly the _fin-de-siècle_ attitude of to-day.\r\n\r\nThis fashionable term has the necessary vagueness which fits it to\r\nconvey all the half-conscious and indistinct drift of current ideas.\r\nJust as the words ‘freedom,’ ‘ideal,’ ‘progress’ seem to express\r\nnotions, but actually are only sounds, so in itself _fin-de-siècle_\r\nmeans nothing, and receives a varying signification according to the\r\ndiverse mental horizons of those who use it.\r\n\r\nThe surest way of knowing what _fin-de-siècle_ implies, is to consider\r\na series of particular instances where the word has been applied. Those\r\nwhich I shall adduce are drawn from French books and periodicals of the\r\nlast two years.[3]\r\n\r\nA king abdicates, leaves his country, and takes up his residence in\r\nParis, having reserved certain political rights. One day he loses much\r\nmoney at play, and is in a dilemma. He therefore makes an agreement\r\nwith the Government of his country, by which, on receipt of a million\r\nfrancs, he renounces for ever every title, official position and\r\nprivilege remaining to him. _Fin-de-siècle_ king.\r\n\r\nA bishop is prosecuted for insulting the minister of public worship.\r\nThe proceedings terminated, his attendant canons distribute amongst\r\nthe reporters in court a defence, copies of which he has prepared\r\nbeforehand. When condemned to pay a fine, he gets up a public\r\ncollection, which brings in tenfold the amount of the penalty. He\r\npublishes a justificatory volume containing all the expressions of\r\nsupport which have reached him. He makes a tour through the country,\r\nexhibits himself in every cathedral to the mob curious to see the\r\ncelebrity of the hour, and takes the opportunity of sending round the\r\nplate. _Fin-de-siècle_ bishop.\r\n\r\nThe corpse of the murderer Pranzini after execution underwent autopsy.\r\nThe head of the secret police cuts off a large piece of skin, has\r\nit tanned, and the leather made into cigar-cases and card-cases for\r\nhimself and some of his friends. _Fin-de-siècle_ official.\r\n\r\nAn American weds his bride in a gas-factory, then gets with her into\r\na balloon held in readiness, and enters on a honeymoon in the clouds.\r\n_Fin-de-siècle_ wedding.\r\n\r\nAn _attaché_ of the Chinese Embassy publishes high-class works in\r\nFrench under his own name. He negotiates with banks respecting a\r\nlarge loan for his Government, and draws large advances for himself\r\non the unfinished contract. Later it comes out that the books were\r\ncomposed by his French secretary, and that he has swindled the banks.\r\n_Fin-de-siècle_ diplomatist.\r\n\r\nA public schoolboy walking with a chum passes the gaol where his\r\nfather, a rich banker, has repeatedly been imprisoned for fraudulent\r\nbankruptcy, embezzlement and similar lucrative misdemeanours. Pointing\r\nto the building, he tells his friend with a smile: ‘Look, that’s the\r\ngovernor’s school.’ _Fin-de-siècle_ son.\r\n\r\nTwo young ladies of good family, and school friends, are chatting\r\ntogether. One heaves a sigh. ‘What’s the matter?’ asks the other. ‘I’m\r\nin love with Raoul, and he with me.’ ‘Oh, that’s lovely! He’s handsome,\r\nyoung, elegant; and yet you’re sad?’ ‘Yes, but he has nothing, and\r\nis nothing, and my parents want me to marry the baron, who is fat,\r\nbald, and ugly, but has a huge lot of money.’ ‘Well, marry the baron\r\nwithout any fuss, and make Raoul acquainted with him, you goose.’\r\n_Fin-de-siècle_ girls.\r\n\r\nSuch test-cases show how the word is understood in the land of its\r\nbirth. Germans who ape Paris fashions, and apply _fin-de-siècle_\r\nalmost exclusively to mean what is indecent and improper, misuse the\r\nword in their coarse ignorance as much as, in a previous generation,\r\nthey vulgarized the expression _demi-monde_, misunderstanding its\r\nproper meaning, and giving it the sense of _fille de joie_, whereas\r\nits creator Dumas intended it to denote persons whose lives contained\r\nsome dark period, for which they were excluded from the circle to which\r\nthey belong by birth, education, or profession, but who do not by their\r\nmanner betray, at least to the inexperienced, that they are no longer\r\nacknowledged as members of their own caste.\r\n\r\n_Prima facie_, a king who sells his sovereign rights for a big cheque\r\nseems to have little in common with a newly-wedded pair who make their\r\nwedding-trip in a balloon, nor is the connection at once obvious\r\nbetween an episcopal Barnum and a well-brought-up young lady who\r\nadvises her friend to a wealthy marriage mitigated by a _cicisbeo_. All\r\nthese _fin-de-siècle_ cases have, nevertheless, a common feature, to\r\nwit, a contempt for traditional views of custom and morality.\r\n\r\nSuch is the notion underlying the word _fin-de-siècle_. It means a\r\npractical emancipation from traditional discipline, which theoretically\r\nis still in force. To the voluptuary this means unbridled lewdness, the\r\nunchaining of the beast in man; to the withered heart of the egoist,\r\ndisdain of all consideration for his fellow-men, the trampling under\r\nfoot of all barriers which enclose brutal greed of lucre and lust\r\nof pleasure; to the contemner of the world it means the shameless\r\nascendency of base impulses and motives, which were, if not virtuously\r\nsuppressed, at least hypocritically hidden; to the believer it means\r\nthe repudiation of dogma, the negation of a supersensuous world, the\r\ndescent into flat phenomenalism; to the sensitive nature yearning for\r\næsthetic thrills, it means the vanishing of ideals in art, and no more\r\npower in its accepted forms to arouse emotion. And to all, it means the\r\nend of an established order, which for thousands of years has satisfied\r\nlogic, fettered depravity, and in every art matured something of beauty.\r\n\r\nOne epoch of history is unmistakably in its decline, and another\r\nis announcing its approach. There is a sound of rending in every\r\ntradition, and it is as though the morrow would not link itself with\r\nto-day. Things as they are totter and plunge, and they are suffered to\r\nreel and fall, because man is weary, and there is no faith that it\r\nis worth an effort to uphold them. Views that have hitherto governed\r\nminds are dead or driven hence like disenthroned kings, and for their\r\ninheritance they that hold the titles and they that would usurp are\r\nlocked in struggle. Meanwhile interregnum in all its terrors prevails;\r\nthere is confusion among the powers that be; the million, robbed of its\r\nleaders, knows not where to turn; the strong work their will; false\r\nprophets arise, and dominion is divided amongst those whose rod is the\r\nheavier because their time is short. Men look with longing for whatever\r\nnew things are at hand, without presage whence they will come or what\r\nthey will be. They have hope that in the chaos of thought, art may\r\nyield revelations of the order that is to follow on this tangled web.\r\nThe poet, the musician, is to announce, or divine, or at least suggest\r\nin what forms civilization will further be evolved. What shall be\r\nconsidered good to-morrow--what shall be beautiful? What shall we know\r\nto-morrow--what believe in? What shall inspire us? How shall we enjoy?\r\nSo rings the question from the thousand voices of the people, and where\r\na market-vendor sets up his booth and claims to give an answer, where\r\na fool or a knave suddenly begins to prophesy in verse or prose, in\r\nsound or colour, or professes to practise his art otherwise than his\r\npredecessors and competitors, there gathers a great concourse, crowding\r\naround him to seek in what he has wrought, as in oracles of the Pythia,\r\nsome meaning to be divined and interpreted. And the more vague and\r\ninsignificant they are, the more they seem to convey of the future to\r\nthe poor gaping souls gasping for revelations, and the more greedily\r\nand passionately are they expounded.\r\n\r\nSuch is the spectacle presented by the doings of men in the reddened\r\nlight of the Dusk of the Nations. Massed in the sky the clouds are\r\naflame in the weirdly beautiful glow which was observed for the space\r\nof years after the eruption of Krakatoa. Over the earth the shadows\r\ncreep with deepening gloom, wrapping all objects in a mysterious\r\ndimness, in which all certainty is destroyed and any guess seems\r\nplausible. Forms lose their outlines, and are dissolved in floating\r\nmist. The day is over, the night draws on. The old anxiously watch its\r\napproach, fearing they will not live to see the end. A few amongst the\r\nyoung and strong are conscious of the vigour of life in all their veins\r\nand nerves, and rejoice in the coming sunrise. Dreams, which fill up\r\nthe hours of darkness till the breaking of the new day, bring to the\r\nformer comfortless memories, to the latter high-souled hopes. And in\r\nthe artistic products of the age we see the form in which these dreams\r\nbecome sensible.\r\n\r\nHere is the place to forestall a possible misunderstanding. The\r\ngreat majority of the middle and lower classes is naturally not\r\n_fin-de-siècle_. It is true that the spirit of the times is stirring\r\nthe nations down to their lowest depths, and awaking even in the most\r\ninchoate and rudimentary human being a wondrous feeling of stir and\r\nupheaval. But this more or less slight touch of moral sea-sickness\r\ndoes not excite in him the cravings of travailing women, nor express\r\nitself in new æsthetic needs. The Philistine or the Proletarian still\r\nfinds undiluted satisfaction in the old and oldest forms of art and\r\npoetry, if he knows himself unwatched by the scornful eye of the votary\r\nof fashion, and is free to yield to his own inclinations. He prefers\r\nOhnet’s novels to all the symbolists, and Mascagni’s _Cavalleria\r\nRusticana_ to all Wagnerians and to Wagner himself; he enjoys himself\r\nroyally over slap-dash farces and music-hall melodies, and yawns or is\r\nangered at Ibsen; he contemplates gladly chromos of paintings depicting\r\nMunich beer-houses and rustic taverns, and passes the open-air painters\r\nwithout a glance. It is only a very small minority who honestly\r\nfind pleasure in the new tendencies, and announce them with genuine\r\nconviction as that which alone is sound, a sure guide for the future,\r\na pledge of pleasure and of moral benefit. But this minority has the\r\ngift of covering the whole visible surface of society, as a little\r\noil extends over a large area of the surface of the sea. It consists\r\nchiefly of rich educated people, or of fanatics. The former give the\r\n_ton_ to all the snobs, the fools, and the blockheads; the latter make\r\nan impression upon the weak and dependent, and intimidate the nervous.\r\nAll snobs affect to have the same taste as the select and exclusive\r\nminority, who pass by everything that once was considered beautiful\r\nwith an air of the greatest contempt. And thus it appears as if the\r\nwhole of civilized humanity were converted to the æsthetics of the Dusk\r\nof the Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us follow in the train frequenting the palaces of European\r\ncapitals, the highways of fashionable watering-places, the receptions\r\nof the rich, and observe the figures of which it is composed.\r\n\r\nAmongst the women, one wears her hair combed smoothly back and down\r\nlike Rafael’s Maddalena Doni in the Pitti at Florence; another wears\r\nit drawn up high over the temples like Julia, daughter of Titus, or\r\nPlotina, wife of Trajan, in the busts in the Louvre; a third has\r\nhers cut short in front on the brow and long in the nape, waved and\r\nlightly puffed, after the fashion of the fifteenth century, as may be\r\nseen in the pages and young knights of Gentile Bellini, Botticelli\r\nand Mantegna. Many have their hair dyed, and in such a fashion as to\r\nbe startling in its revolt against the law of organic harmony, and\r\nthe effect of a studied discord, only to be resolved into the higher\r\npolyphony of the toilet taken as a whole. This swarthy, dark-eyed\r\nwoman snaps her fingers at nature by framing the brown tones of her\r\nface in copper-red or golden-yellow; yonder blue-eyed fair, with a\r\ncomplexion of milk and roses, intensifies the brightness of her cheeks\r\nby a setting of artificially blue-black tresses. Here is one who covers\r\nher head with a huge heavy felt hat, an obvious imitation, in its\r\nbrim turned up at the back, and its trimming of large plush balls, of\r\nthe sombrero of the Spanish bull-fighters, who were displaying their\r\nskill in Paris at the exhibition of 1889, and giving all kinds of\r\n_motifs_ to modistes. There is another who has stuck on her hair the\r\nemerald-green or ruby-red biretta of the mediæval travelling student.\r\nThe costume is in keeping with the bizarre coiffure. Here is a mantle\r\nreaching to the waist, slit up on one side, draping the breast like\r\na _portière_, and trimmed round the hem with little silken bells, by\r\nthe incessant clicking of which a sensitive spectator would in a very\r\nshort time either be hypnotized or driven to take frantic fright.\r\nThere is a Greek peplos, of which the tailors speak as glibly as any\r\nvenerable philologist. Next to the stiff monumental trim of Catharine\r\nde Medicis, and the high ruff of Mary, Queen of Scots, goes the flowing\r\nwhite raiment of the angel of the Annunciation in Memling’s pictures,\r\nand, by way of antithesis, that caricature of masculine array, the\r\nfitting cloth coat, with widely opened lapels, waistcoat, stiffened\r\nshirt-front, small stand-up collar, and necktie. The majority, anxious\r\nto be inconspicuous in unimaginative mediocrity, seems to have for\r\nits leading style a laboured rococo, with bewildering oblique lines,\r\nincomprehensible swellings, puffings, expansions and contractions,\r\nfolds with irrational beginning and aimless ending, in which all the\r\noutlines of the human figure are lost, and which cause women’s bodies\r\nto resemble now a beast of the Apocalypse, now an armchair, now a\r\ntriptych, or some other ornament.\r\n\r\nThe children, strolling beside their mothers thus bedecked, are\r\nembodiments of one of the most afflicting aberrations into which the\r\nimagination of a spinster ever lapsed. They are living copies of the\r\npictures of Kate Greenaway, whose love of children, diverted from its\r\nnatural outlet, has sought gratification in the most affected style of\r\ndrawing, wherein the sacredness of childhood is profaned under absurd\r\ndisguises. Here is an imp dressed from head to foot in the blood-red\r\ncostume of a mediæval executioner; there a four-year-old girl wears a\r\ncabriolet bonnet of her great-grandmother’s days and sweeps after her a\r\ncourt mantle of loud-hued velvet. Another wee dot, just able to keep on\r\nher tottering legs, has been arrayed in the long dress of a lady of the\r\nFirst Empire, with puffed sleeves and short waist.\r\n\r\nThe men complete the picture. They are preserved from excessive oddity\r\nthrough fear of the Philistine’s laugh, or through some remains of\r\nsanity in taste, and, with the exception of the red dress-coat with\r\nmetal buttons, and knee-breeches with silk stockings, with which some\r\nidiots in eye-glass and gardenia try to rival burlesque actors, present\r\nlittle deviation from the ruling canon of the masculine attire of the\r\nday. But fancy plays the more freely among their hair. One displays\r\nthe short curls and the wavy double-pointed beard of Lucius Verus,\r\nanother looks like the whiskered cat in a Japanese kakemono. His\r\nneighbour has the _barbiche_ of Henri IV., another the fierce moustache\r\nof a lansquenet by F. Brun, or the chin-tuft of the city-watch in\r\nRembrandt’s ‘Ronde de Nuit.’\r\n\r\nThe common feature in all these male specimens is that they do not\r\nexpress their real idiosyncrasies, but try to present something that\r\nthey are not. They are not content to show their natural figure, nor\r\neven to supplement it by legitimate accessories, in harmony with the\r\ntype to which they approximate, but they seek to model themselves\r\nafter some artistic pattern which has no affinity with their own\r\nnature, or is even antithetical to it. Nor do they for the most part\r\nlimit themselves to one pattern, but copy several at once, which jar\r\none with another. Thus we get heads set on shoulders not belonging to\r\nthem, costumes the elements of which are as disconnected as though\r\nthey belonged to a dream, colours that seem to have been matched in\r\nthe dark. The impression is that of a masked festival, where all are\r\nin disguises, and with heads too in character. There are several\r\noccasions, such as the varnishing day at the Paris Champs de Mars\r\nsalon, or the opening of the Exhibition of the Royal Academy in London,\r\nwhere this impression is so weirdly intensified, that one seems to be\r\nmoving amongst dummies patched together at haphazard, in a mythical\r\nmortuary, from fragments of bodies, heads, trunks, limbs, just as they\r\ncame to hand, and which the designer, in heedless pell-mell, clothed at\r\nrandom in the garments of all epochs and countries. Every single figure\r\nstrives visibly by some singularity in outline, set, cut, or colour,\r\nto startle attention violently, and imperiously to detain it. Each\r\none wishes to create a strong nervous excitement, no matter whether\r\nagreeably or disagreeably. The fixed idea is to produce an effect at\r\nany price.\r\n\r\nLet us follow these folk in masquerade and with heads in character to\r\ntheir dwellings. Here are at once stage properties and lumber-rooms,\r\nrag-shops and museums. The study of the master of the house is a Gothic\r\nhall of chivalry, with cuirasses, shields and crusading banners on the\r\nwalls; or the shop of an Oriental bazaar with Kurd carpets, Bedouin\r\nchests, Circassian narghilehs and Indian lacquered caskets. By the\r\nmirror on the mantelpiece are fierce or funny Japanese masks. Between\r\nthe windows are staring trophies of swords, daggers, clubs and old\r\nwheel-trigger pistols. Daylight filters in through painted glass, where\r\nlean saints kneel in rapture. In the drawing-room the walls are either\r\nhung with worm-eaten Gobelin tapestry, discoloured by the sun of two\r\ncenturies (or it may be by a deftly mixed chemical bath), or covered\r\nwith Morris draperies, on which strange birds flit amongst crazily\r\nramping branches, and blowzy flowers coquet with vain butterflies.\r\nAmongst armchairs and padded seats, such as the cockered bodies of our\r\ncontemporaries know and expect, there are Renaissance stools, the heart\r\nor shell-shaped bottoms of which would attract none but the toughened\r\nhide of a rough hero of the jousting lists. Startling is the effect\r\nof a gilt-painted couch between buhl-work cabinets and a puckered\r\nChinese table, next an inlaid writing-table of graceful rococo. On\r\nall the tables and in all the cabinets is a display of antiquities or\r\narticles of vertù, big or small, and for the most part warranted not\r\ngenuine; a figure of Tanagra near a broken jade snuff-box, a Limoges\r\nplate beside a long-necked Persian waterpot of brass, a _bonbonnière_\r\nbetween a breviary bound in carved ivory, and snuffers of chiselled\r\ncopper. Pictures stand on easels draped with velvet, the frames made\r\nconspicuous by some oddity, such as a spider in her web, a metal bunch\r\nof thistle-heads, and the like. In a corner a sort of temple is erected\r\nto a squatting or a standing Buddha. The boudoir of the mistress of\r\nthe house partakes of the nature of a chapel and of a harem. The\r\ntoilet-table is designed and decorated like an altar, a _prie-Dieu_\r\nis a pledge for the piety of the inmate, and a broad divan, with an\r\norgiastic _abandon_ about the cushions, gives reassurance that things\r\nare not so bad. In the dining-room the walls are hung with the whole\r\nstock-in-trade of a porcelain shop, costly silver is displayed in an\r\nold farmhouse dresser, and on the table bloom aristocratic orchids, and\r\nproud silver vessels shine between rustic stone-ware plates and ewers.\r\nIn the evening, lamps of the stature of a man illumine these rooms with\r\nlight both subdued and tinted by sprawling shades, red, yellow or green\r\nof hue, and even covered by black lace. Hence the inmates appear,\r\nnow bathed in variegated diaphanous mist, now suffused with coloured\r\nradiance, while the corners and backgrounds are shrouded in depths of\r\nartfully-effected _clair-obscur_, and the furniture and bric-à-brac\r\nare dyed in unreal chords of colour. Unreal, too, are the studied\r\npostures, by assuming which the inmates are enabled to reproduce on\r\ntheir faces the light effects of Rembrandt or Schalcken. Everything in\r\nthese houses aims at exciting the nerves and dazzling the senses. The\r\ndisconnected and antithetical effects in all arrangements, the constant\r\ncontradiction between form and purpose, the outlandishness of most\r\nobjects, is intended to be bewildering. There must be no sentiment of\r\nrepose, such as is felt at any composition, the plan of which is easily\r\ntaken in, nor of the comfort attending a prompt comprehension of all\r\nthe details of one’s environment. He who enters here must not doze, but\r\nbe thrilled. If the master of the house roams about these rooms clothed\r\nafter the example of Balzac in a white monk’s cowl, or after the model\r\nof Richepin in the red cloak of the robber-chieftain of an operetta, he\r\nonly gives expression to the admission that in such a comedy theatre a\r\nclown is in place. All is discrepant, indiscriminate jumble. The unity\r\nof abiding by one definite historic style counts as old-fashioned,\r\nprovincial, Philistine, and the time has not yet produced a style\r\nof its own. An approach is, perhaps, made to one in the furniture\r\nof Carabin, exhibited in the salon of the Champs de Mars. But these\r\nbalusters, down which naked furies and possessed creatures are rolling\r\nin mad riot, these bookcases, where base and pilaster consist of a pile\r\nof guillotined heads, and even this table, representing a gigantic open\r\nbook borne by gnomes, make up a style that is feverish and infernal. If\r\nthe director-general of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ had an audience-chamber, it\r\nmight well be furnished with such as these. Carabin’s creations may be\r\nintended to equip a house, but they are a nightmare.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how society dresses and where it dwells. We shall now\r\nobserve how it enjoys itself, and where it seeks stimulation and\r\ndistraction. In the art exhibition it crowds, with proper little cries\r\nof admiration, round Besnard’s women, with their grass-green hair,\r\nfaces of sulphur-yellow or fiery-red, and arms spotted in violet and\r\npink, dressed in a shining blue cloud resembling faintly a sort of\r\nnightdress; that is to say, it has a fondness for bold, revolutionary\r\ndebauch of colour. But not exclusively so. Next to Besnard it worships\r\nwith equal or greater rapture the works of Puvis de Chavannes, wan,\r\nand as though blotted out with a half-transparent wash of lime; or\r\nthose of Carrière, suffused in a problematical vapour, reeking as if\r\nwith a cloud of incense; or those of Roll, shimmering in a soft and\r\nsilvery sheen. The purple of the Manet school, steeping the whole\r\nvisible creation in bluish glamour, the half-tones, or, rather,\r\nphantom-colours of the ‘Archaists,’ that seem to have risen, faded and\r\nnebulous, out of some primeval tomb, and all these palettes of ‘dead\r\nleaves,’ ‘old ivory,’ evaporating yellows, smothered purple, attract on\r\nthe whole more rapturous glances than the voluptuous ‘orchestration’\r\nof the Besnard section. The subject of the picture leaves these\r\nselect gazers apparently indifferent; it is only seamstresses and\r\ncountry-folk, the grateful _clientèle_ of the chromo, who linger over\r\nthe ‘story.’ And yet these as they pass stop by preference before\r\nHenry Martin’s ‘Every Man and his Chimæra,’ in which bloated figures,\r\nin an atmosphere of yellow broth, are doing incomprehensible things\r\nthat need profound explanation; or before Jean Béraud’s ‘Christ and\r\nthe Adulteress,’ where, in a Parisian dining-room, in the midst of a\r\ncompany in dress-coats, and before a woman in ball-dress, a Christ\r\nrobed in correct Oriental gear, and with an orthodox halo, acts a scene\r\nout of the Gospel; or before Raffaelli’s topers and cut-throats of the\r\npurlieus of Paris, drawn in high relief, but painted with ditch-water\r\nand dissolved clay. Steering in the wake of ‘society’ through a\r\npicture-gallery, one will be unalterably convinced that they turn up\r\ntheir eyes and fold their hands before pictures at which the commoner\r\nsort burst out laughing or pull the grimace of a man who believes he\r\nis made a fool of; and that they shrug their shoulders and hasten with\r\nscornful exchange of looks past such as the latter pause at in grateful\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nAt opera and concert the rounded forms of ancient melody are coldly\r\nlistened to. The translucent thematic treatment of classic masters,\r\ntheir conscientious observance of the laws of counterpoint, are\r\nreckoned flat and tedious. A coda graceful in cadence, serene in its\r\n‘dying fall,’ a pedal-base with correct harmonization, provoke yawns.\r\nApplause and wreaths are reserved for Wagner’s _Tristan and Isolde_,\r\nand especially the mystic _Parsifal_, for the religious music in\r\nBruneau’s _Dream_, or the symphonies of César Franck. Music in order\r\nto please must either counterfeit religious devotion, or agitate the\r\nmind by its form. The musical listener is accustomed involuntarily\r\nto develop a little in his mind every motive occurring in a piece.\r\nThe mode in which the composer carries out his _motif_ is bound,\r\naccordingly, to differ entirely from this anticipated development.\r\nIt must not admit of being guessed. A dissonant interval must appear\r\nwhere a consonant interval was expected; if the hearer is hoping that\r\na phrase in what is an obvious final cadence will be spun out to its\r\nnatural end, it must be sharply interrupted in the middle of a bar.\r\nKeys and pitch must change suddenly. In the orchestra a vigorous\r\npolyphony must summon the attention in several directions at once;\r\nparticular instruments, or groups of instruments, must address the\r\nlistener simultaneously without heeding each other, till he gets as\r\nnervously excited as the man who vainly endeavours to understand what\r\nis being said in the jangle of a dozen voices. The theme, even if in\r\nthe first instance it has a distinct outline, must become ever more\r\nindefinite, ever more dissolving into a mist, in which the imagination\r\ncan see any forms it likes, as in driving clouds of night. The tide of\r\nsound must flow on without any perceptible limit or goal, surging up\r\nand down in endless chromatic passages of triplets. If now and then\r\nit delude the listener, borne along by it, and straining his eyes to\r\nsee land with glimpses of a distant shore, this is soon discovered to\r\nbe a fleeting mirage. The music must continually promise, but never\r\nperform; must seem about to tell some great secret, and grow dumb or\r\nbreak away ere to throbbing hearts it tells the word they wait for. The\r\naudience go to their concert-room in quest of Tantalus moods, and leave\r\nit with all the nervous exhaustion of a young pair of lovers, who for\r\nhours at the nightly tryst have sought to exchange caresses through a\r\nclosely-barred window.\r\n\r\nThe books in which the public here depicted finds its delight or\r\nedification diffuse a curious perfume yielding distinguishable odours\r\nof incense, eau de Lubin and refuse, one or the other preponderating\r\nalternately. Mere sewage exhalations are played out. The filth of\r\nZola’s art and of his disciples in literary canal-dredging has been\r\ngot over, and nothing remains for it but to turn to submerged peoples\r\nand social strata. The vanguard of civilization holds its nose at the\r\npit of undiluted naturalism, and can only be brought to bend over it\r\nwith sympathy and curiosity when, by cunning engineering, a drain from\r\nthe boudoir and the sacristy has been turned into it. Mere sensuality\r\npasses as commonplace, and only finds admission when disguised as\r\nsomething unnatural and degenerate. Books treating of the relations\r\nbetween the sexes, with no matter how little reserve, seem too dully\r\nmoral. Elegant titillation only begins where normal sexual relations\r\nleave off. Priapus has become a symbol of virtue. Vice looks to Sodom\r\nand Lesbos, to Bluebeard’s castle and the servants’ hall of the\r\n‘divine’ Marquis de Sade’s _Justine_, for its embodiments.\r\n\r\nThe book that would be fashionable must, above all, be obscure. The\r\nintelligible is cheap goods for the million only. It must further\r\ndiscourse in a certain pulpit tone--mildly unctuous, not too\r\ninsistent; and it must follow up risky scenes by tearful outpourings\r\nof love for the lowly and the suffering, or glowing transports of\r\npiety. Ghost-stories are very popular, but they must come on in\r\nscientific disguise, as hypnotism, telepathy, somnambulism. So are\r\nmarionette-plays, in which seemingly naïve but knowing rogues make\r\nused-up old ballad dummies babble like babies or idiots. So are\r\nesoteric novels, in which the author hints that he could say a deal\r\nabout magic, kabbala, fakirism, astrology and other white and black\r\narts if he only chose. Readers intoxicate themselves in the hazy\r\nword-sequences of symbolic poetry. Ibsen dethrones Goethe; Maeterlinck\r\nranks with Shakespeare; Nietzsche is pronounced by German and even\r\nby French critics to be the leading German writer of the day; the\r\n_Kreutzer Sonata_ is the Bible of ladies, who are amateurs in love,\r\nbut bereft of lovers; dainty gentlemen find the street ballads and\r\ngaol-bird songs of Jules Jouy, Bruant, MacNab and Xanroff very\r\n_distingué_ on account of ‘the warm sympathy pulsing in them,’ as the\r\nstock phrase runs; and society persons, whose creed is limited to\r\nbaccarat and the money market, make pilgrimages to the Oberammergau\r\nPassion-play, and wipe away a tear over Paul Verlaine’s invocations to\r\nthe Virgin.\r\n\r\nBut art exhibitions, concerts, plays and books, however extraordinary,\r\ndo not suffice for the æsthetic needs of elegant society. Novel\r\nsensations alone can satisfy it. It demands more intense stimulus,\r\nand hopes for it in spectacles, where different arts strive in new\r\ncombinations to affect all the senses at once. Poets and artists\r\nstrain every nerve incessantly to satisfy this craving. A painter, who\r\nfor that matter is less occupied with new impressions than with old\r\npuffs, paints a picture indifferently well of the dying Mozart working\r\nat his _Requiem_, and exhibits it of an evening in a darkened room,\r\nwhile a dazzling ray of skilfully directed electric light falls on\r\nthe painting, and an invisible orchestra softly plays the _Requiem_.\r\nA musician goes one step further. Developing to the utmost a Bayreuth\r\nusage, he arranges a concert in a totally darkened hall, and thus\r\ndelights those of the audience who find opportunity, by happily\r\nchosen juxtapositions, to augment their musical sensations by hidden\r\nenjoyment of another sort. Haraucourt, the poet, has his paraphrase of\r\nthe Gospel, written in spirited verse, recited on the stage by Sarah\r\nBernhardt, while, as in the old-fashioned melodrama, soft music in\r\nunending melody accompanies the actress. Even the nose, hitherto basely\r\nignored by the fine arts, attracts the pioneers, and is by them invited\r\nto take part in æsthetic delights. A hose is set up in the theatre, by\r\nwhich the spectators are sprayed with perfumes. On the stage a poem in\r\napproximately dramatic form is recited. In every division, act, scene,\r\nor however the thing is called, a different vowel-sound is made to\r\npreponderate; during each the theatre is illuminated with a differently\r\ntinted light, the orchestra discourses music in a different key, and\r\nthe jet gives out a different perfume. This idea of accompanying verses\r\nwith odours was thrown out years ago, half in jest, by Ernest Eckstein.\r\nParis has carried it out in sacred earnest. The new school fetch the\r\npuppet theatre out of the nursery, and enact pieces for adults which,\r\nwith artificial simplicity, pretend to hide or reveal a profound\r\nmeaning, and with great talent and ingenuity execute a magic-lantern of\r\nprettily drawn and painted figures moving across surprisingly luminous\r\nbackgrounds; and these living pictures make visible the process of\r\nthought in the mind of the author who recites his accompanying poem,\r\nwhile a piano endeavours to illustrate the leading emotion. And to\r\nenjoy such exhibitions as these society crowds into a suburban circus,\r\nthe loft of a back tenement, a second-hand costumier’s shop, or a\r\nfantastic artist’s restaurant, where the performances, in some room\r\nconsecrated to beery potations, bring together the greasy _habitué_ and\r\nthe dainty aristocratic fledgling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE manifestations described in the preceding chapter must be patent\r\nenough to everyone, be he never so narrow a Philistine. The Philistine,\r\nhowever, regards them as a passing fashion and nothing more; for him\r\nthe current terms, caprice, eccentricity, affectation of novelty,\r\nimitation, instinct, afford a sufficient explanation. The purely\r\nliterary mind, whose merely æsthetic culture does not enable him to\r\nunderstand the connections of things, and to seize their real meaning,\r\ndeceives himself and others as to his ignorance by means of sounding\r\nphrases, and loftily talks of a ‘restless quest of a new ideal by the\r\nmodern spirit,’ ‘the richer vibrations of the refined nervous system\r\nof the present day,’ ‘the unknown sensations of an elect mind.’ But\r\nthe physician, especially if he have devoted himself to the special\r\nstudy of nervous and mental maladies, recognises at a glance, in the\r\n_fin-de-siècle_ disposition, in the tendencies of contemporary art and\r\npoetry, in the life and conduct of the men who write mystic, symbolic\r\nand ‘decadent’ works, and the attitude taken by their admirers in the\r\ntastes and æsthetic instincts of fashionable society, the confluence\r\nof two well-defined conditions of disease, with which he is quite\r\nfamiliar, viz. degeneration (degeneracy) and hysteria, of which the\r\nminor stages are designated as neurasthenia. These two conditions of\r\nthe organism differ from each other, yet have many features in common,\r\nand frequently occur together; so that it is easier to observe them in\r\ntheir composite forms, than each in isolation.\r\n\r\nThe conception of degeneracy, which, at this time, obtains throughout\r\nthe science of mental disease, was first clearly grasped and formulated\r\nby Morel. In his principal work--often quoted, but, unfortunately, not\r\nsufficiently read[4]--the following definition of what he wishes to be\r\nunderstood by ‘degeneracy’ is given by this distinguished expert in\r\nmental pathology, who was, for a short time, famous in Germany, even\r\noutside professional circles.[5]\r\n\r\n‘The clearest notion we can form of degeneracy is to regard it as _a\r\nmorbid deviation from an original type_. This deviation, even if, at\r\nthe outset, it was ever so slight, contained transmissible elements of\r\nsuch a nature that anyone bearing in him the germs becomes more and\r\nmore incapable of fulfilling his functions in the world; and mental\r\nprogress, already checked in his own person, finds itself menaced also\r\nin his descendants.’\r\n\r\nWhen under any kind of noxious influences an organism becomes\r\ndebilitated, its successors will not resemble the healthy, normal\r\ntype of the species, with capacities for development, but will form\r\na new sub-species, which, like all others, possesses the capacity of\r\ntransmitting to its offspring, in a continuously increasing degree, its\r\npeculiarities, these being morbid deviations from the normal form--gaps\r\nin development, malformations and infirmities. That which distinguishes\r\ndegeneracy from the formation of new species (phylogeny) is, that the\r\nmorbid variation does not continuously subsist and propagate itself,\r\nlike one that is healthy, but, fortunately, is soon rendered sterile,\r\nand after a few generations often dies out before it reaches the lowest\r\ngrade of organic degradation.[6]\r\n\r\nDegeneracy betrays itself among men in certain physical\r\ncharacteristics, which are denominated ‘stigmata,’ or brand-marks--an\r\nunfortunate term derived from a false idea, as if degeneracy were\r\nnecessarily the consequence of a fault, and the indication of it a\r\npunishment. Such stigmata consist of deformities, multiple and stunted\r\ngrowths in the first line of asymmetry, the unequal development of\r\nthe two halves of the face and cranium; then imperfection in the\r\ndevelopment of the external ear, which is conspicuous for its enormous\r\nsize, or protrudes from the head, like a handle, and the lobe of which\r\nis either lacking or adhering to the head, and the helix of which is\r\nnot involuted; further, squint-eyes, hare-lips, irregularities in the\r\nform and position of the teeth; pointed or flat palates, webbed or\r\nsupernumerary fingers (syn-and polydactylia), etc. In the book from\r\nwhich I have quoted, Morel gives a list of the anatomical phenomena of\r\ndegeneracy, which later observers have largely extended. In particular,\r\nLombroso[7] has conspicuously broadened our knowledge of stigmata,\r\nbut he apportions them merely to his ‘born criminals’--a limitation\r\nwhich from the very scientific standpoint of Lombroso himself cannot\r\nbe justified, his ‘born criminals’ being nothing but a subdivision of\r\ndegenerates. Féré[8] expresses this very emphatically when he says,\r\n‘Vice, crime and madness are only distinguished from each other by\r\nsocial prejudices.’\r\n\r\nThere might be a sure means of proving that the application of the term\r\n‘degenerates’ to the originators of all the _fin-de-siècle_ movements\r\nin art and literature is not arbitrary, that it is no baseless conceit,\r\nbut a fact; and that would be a careful physical examination of the\r\npersons concerned, and an inquiry into their pedigree. In almost all\r\ncases, relatives would be met with who were undoubtedly degenerate, and\r\none or more stigmata discovered which would indisputably establish the\r\ndiagnosis of ‘Degeneration.’ Of course, from human consideration, the\r\nresult of such an inquiry could often not be made public; and he alone\r\nwould be convinced who should be able to undertake it himself.\r\n\r\nScience, however, has found, together with these physical stigmata,\r\nothers of a mental order, which betoken degeneracy quite as clearly as\r\nthe former; and they allow of an easy demonstration from all the vital\r\nmanifestations, and, in particular, from all the works of degenerates,\r\nso that it is not necessary to measure the cranium of an author, or to\r\nsee the lobe of a painter’s ear, in order to recognise the fact that he\r\nbelongs to the class of degenerates.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of different designations have been found for these\r\npersons. Maudsley and Ball call them ‘Borderland dwellers’--that is to\r\nsay, dwellers on the borderland between reason and pronounced madness.\r\nMagnan gives to them the name of ‘higher degenerates’ (_dégénérés\r\nsupérieurs_), and Lombroso speaks of ‘mattoids’ (from _matto_, the\r\nItalian for insane), and ‘graphomaniacs,’ under which he classifies\r\nthose semi-insane persons who feel a strong impulse to write. In spite,\r\nhowever, of this variety of nomenclature, it is a question simply of\r\none single species of individuals, who betray their fellowship by the\r\nsimilarity of their mental physiognomy.\r\n\r\nIn the mental development of degenerates, we meet with the same\r\nirregularity that we have observed in their physical growth. The\r\nasymmetry of face and cranium finds, as it were, its counterpart in\r\ntheir mental faculties. Some of the latter are completely stunted,\r\nothers morbidly exaggerated. That which nearly all degenerates lack is\r\nthe sense of morality and of right and wrong. For them there exists no\r\nlaw, no decency, no modesty. In order to satisfy any momentary impulse,\r\nor inclination, or caprice, they commit crimes and trespasses with the\r\ngreatest calmness and self-complacency, and do not comprehend that\r\nother persons take offence thereat. When this phenomenon is present in\r\na high degree, we speak of ‘moral insanity’ with Maudsley;[9] there\r\nare, nevertheless, lower stages in which the degenerate does not,\r\nperhaps, himself commit any act which will bring him into conflict with\r\nthe criminal code, but at least asserts the theoretical legitimacy of\r\ncrime; seeks, with philosophically sounding fustian, to prove that\r\n‘good’ and ‘evil,’ virtue and vice, are arbitrary distinctions; goes\r\ninto raptures over evildoers and their deeds; professes to discover\r\nbeauties in the lowest and most repulsive things; and tries to awaken\r\ninterest in, and so-called ‘comprehension’ of, every bestiality.\r\nThe two psychological roots of moral insanity, in all its degrees\r\nof development, are, firstly, unbounded egoism,[10] and, secondly,\r\nimpulsiveness[11]--_i.e._, inability to resist a sudden impulse to any\r\ndeed; and these characteristics also constitute the chief intellectual\r\nstigmata of degenerates. In the following sections of this work, I\r\nshall find occasion to show on what organic grounds, and in consequence\r\nof what peculiarities of their brain and nervous system, degenerates\r\nare necessarily egoistical and impulsive. In these introductory remarks\r\nI would wish only to point out the stigma itself.\r\n\r\nAnother mental stigma of degenerates is their emotionalism.\r\nMorel[12] has even wished to make this peculiarity their chief\r\ncharacteristic--erroneously, it seems to me, for it is present in the\r\nsame degree among hysterics, and, indeed, is to be found in perfectly\r\nhealthy persons, who, from any transient cause, such as illness,\r\nexhaustion, or any mental shock, have been temporarily weakened.\r\nNevertheless it is a phenomenon rarely absent in a degenerate. He\r\nlaughs until he sheds tears, or weeps copiously without adequate\r\noccasion; a commonplace line of poetry or of prose sends a shudder\r\ndown his back; he falls into raptures before indifferent pictures\r\nor statues; and music especially, even the most insipid and least\r\ncommendable, arouses in him the most vehement emotions. He is quite\r\nproud of being so vibrant a musical instrument, and boasts that where\r\nthe Philistine remains completely cold, he feels his inner self\r\nconfounded, the depths of his being broken up, and the bliss of the\r\nBeautiful possessing him to the tips of his fingers. His excitability\r\nappears to him a mark of superiority; he believes himself to be\r\npossessed by a peculiar insight lacking in other mortals, and he is\r\nfain to despise the vulgar herd for the dulness and narrowness of their\r\nminds. The unhappy creature does not suspect that he is conceited\r\nabout a disease and boasting of a derangement of the mind; and certain\r\nsilly critics, when, through fear of being pronounced deficient in\r\ncomprehension, they make desperate efforts to share the emotions of\r\na degenerate in regard to some insipid or ridiculous production, or\r\nwhen they praise in exaggerated expressions the beauties which the\r\ndegenerate asserts he finds therein, are unconsciously simulating one\r\nof the stigmata of semi-insanity.\r\n\r\nBesides moral insanity and emotionalism, there is to be observed in\r\nthe degenerate a condition of mental weakness and despondency, which,\r\naccording to the circumstances of his life, assumes the form of\r\npessimism, a vague fear of all men, and of the entire phenomenon of\r\nthe universe, or self-abhorrence. ‘These patients,’ says Morel,[13]\r\n‘feel perpetually compelled ... to commiserate themselves, to sob, to\r\nrepeat with the most desperate monotony the same questions and words.\r\nThey have delirious presentations of ruin and damnation, and all\r\nsorts of imaginary fears.’ ‘Ennui never quits me,’ said a patient of\r\nthis kind, whose case Roubinovitch[14] describes, ‘ennui of myself.’\r\n‘Among moral stigmata,’ says the same author,[15] ‘there are also to\r\nbe specified those undefinable apprehensions manifested by degenerates\r\nwhen they see, smell, or touch any object.’ And he further[16] calls\r\nto notice ‘their unconscious fear of everything and everyone.’ In this\r\npicture of the sufferer from melancholia; downcast, sombre, despairing\r\nof himself and the world, tortured by fear of the Unknown, menaced\r\nby undefined but dreadful dangers, we recognise in every detail the\r\nman of the Dusk of the Nations and the _fin-de-siècle_ frame of mind,\r\ndescribed in the first chapter.\r\n\r\nWith this characteristic dejectedness of the degenerate, there\r\nis combined, as a rule, a disinclination to action of any kind,\r\nattaining possibly to abhorrence of activity and powerlessness to will\r\n(_aboulia_). Now, it is a peculiarity of the human mind, known to every\r\npsychologist, that, inasmuch as the law of causality governs a man’s\r\nwhole thought, he imputes a rational basis to all his own decisions.\r\nThis was prettily expressed by Spinoza when he said: ‘If a stone flung\r\nby a human hand could think, it would certainly imagine that it flew\r\nbecause it wished to fly.’ Many mental conditions and operations of\r\nwhich we become conscious are the result of causes which do not reach\r\nour consciousness. In this case we fabricate causes _a posteriori_ for\r\nthem, satisfying our mental need of distinct causality, and we have\r\nno trouble in persuading ourselves that we have now truly explained\r\nthem. The degenerate who shuns action, and is without will-power, has\r\nno suspicion that his incapacity for action is a consequence of his\r\ninherited deficiency of brain. He deceives himself into believing\r\nthat he despises action from free determination, and takes pleasure\r\nin inactivity; and, in order to justify himself in his own eyes, he\r\nconstructs a philosophy of renunciation and of contempt for the world\r\nand men, asserts that he has convinced himself of the excellence of\r\nQuietism, calls himself with consummate self-consciousness a Buddhist,\r\nand praises Nirvana in poetically eloquent phrases as the highest and\r\nworthiest ideal of the human mind. The degenerate and insane are the\r\npredestined disciples of Schopenhauer and Hartmann, and need only to\r\nacquire a knowledge of Buddhism to become converts to it.\r\n\r\nWith the incapacity for action there is connected the predilection\r\nfor inane reverie. The degenerate is not in a condition to fix his\r\nattention long, or indeed at all, on any subject, and is equally\r\nincapable of correctly grasping, ordering, or elaborating into ideas\r\nand judgments the impressions of the external world conveyed to his\r\ndistracted consciousness by his defectively operating senses. It is\r\neasier and more convenient for him to allow his brain-centres to\r\nproduce semi-lucid, nebulously blurred ideas and inchoate embryonic\r\nthoughts, and to surrender himself to the perpetual obfuscation of a\r\nboundless, aimless, and shoreless stream of fugitive ideas; and he\r\nrarely rouses himself to the painful attempt to check or counteract the\r\ncapricious, and, as a rule, purely mechanical associations of ideas\r\nand succession of images, and bring under discipline the disorderly\r\ntumult of his fluid presentations. On the contrary, he rejoices in\r\nhis faculty of imagination, which he contrasts with the insipidity of\r\nthe Philistine, and devotes himself with predilection to all sorts\r\nof unlicensed pursuits permitted by the unshackled vagabondage of\r\nhis mind; while he cannot endure well-ordered civil occupations,\r\nrequiring attention and constant heed to reality. He calls this ‘having\r\nan idealist temperament,’ ascribes to himself irresistible æsthetic\r\npropinquities, and proudly styles himself an artist.[17]\r\n\r\nWe will briefly mention some peculiarities frequently manifested\r\nby a degenerate. He is tormented by doubts, seeks for the basis of\r\nall phenomena, especially those whose first causes are completely\r\ninaccessible to us, and is unhappy when his inquiries and ruminations\r\nlead, as is natural, to no result.[18] He is ever supplying new\r\nrecruits to the army of system-inventing metaphysicians, profound\r\nexpositors of the riddle of the universe, seekers for the philosopher’s\r\nstone, the squaring of the circle and perpetual motion.[19] These\r\nlast three subjects have such a special attraction for him, that\r\nthe Patent Office at Washington is forced to keep on hand printed\r\nreplies to the numberless memorials in which patents are constantly\r\ndemanded for the solution of these chimerical problems. In view of\r\nLombroso’s researches,[20] it can scarcely be doubted that the writings\r\nand acts of revolutionists and anarchists are also attributable to\r\ndegeneracy. The degenerate is incapable of adapting himself to existing\r\ncircumstances. This incapacity, indeed, is an indication of morbid\r\nvariation in every species, and probably a primary cause of their\r\nsudden extinction. He therefore rebels against conditions and views of\r\nthings which he necessarily feels to be painful, chiefly because they\r\nimpose upon him the duty of self-control, of which he is incapable on\r\naccount of his organic weakness of will. Thus he becomes an improver of\r\nthe world, and devises plans for making mankind happy, which, without\r\nexception, are conspicuous quite as much by their fervent philanthropy,\r\nand often pathetic sincerity, as by their absurdity and monstrous\r\nignorance of all real relations.\r\n\r\nFinally, a cardinal mark of degeneration which I have reserved\r\nto the last, is mysticism. Colin says:[21] ‘Of all the delirious\r\nmanifestations peculiar to the hereditarily-afflicted, none indicates\r\nthe condition more clearly, we think, than mystical delirium, or, when\r\nthe malady has not reached this point, the being constantly occupied\r\nwith mystical and religious questions, an exaggerated piety, etc.’ I\r\nwill not here multiply evidence and quotations. In the following books,\r\nwhere the art and poetry of the times are treated of, I shall find\r\noccasion to show the reader that no difference exists between these\r\ntendencies and the religious manias observed in nearly all degenerates\r\nand sufferers from hereditary mental taint.\r\n\r\nI have enumerated the most important features characterizing the\r\nmental condition of the degenerate. The reader can now judge for\r\nhimself whether or not the diagnosis ‘degeneration’ is applicable to\r\nthe originators of the new æsthetic tendencies. It must not for that\r\nmatter be supposed that degeneration is synonymous with absence of\r\ntalent. Nearly all the inquirers who have had degenerates under their\r\nobservation expressly establish the contrary. ‘The degenerate,’ says\r\nLegrain,[22] ‘may be a genius. A badly balanced mind is susceptible\r\nof the highest conceptions, while, on the other hand, one meets in\r\nthe same mind with traits of meanness and pettiness all the more\r\nstriking from the fact that they co-exist with the most brilliant\r\nqualities.’ We shall find this reservation in all authors who have\r\ncontributed to the natural history of the degenerate. ‘As regards\r\ntheir intellect, they can,’ says Roubinovitch,[23] ‘attain to a high\r\ndegree of development, but from a moral point of view their existence\r\nis completely deranged.... A degenerate will employ his brilliant\r\nfaculties quite as well in the service of some grand object as in the\r\nsatisfaction of the basest propensities.’ Lombroso[24] has cited a\r\nlarge number of undoubted geniuses who were equally undoubted mattoids,\r\ngraphomaniacs, or pronounced lunatics; and the utterance of a French\r\nsavant, Guérinsen, ‘Genius is a disease of the nerves,’ has become a\r\n‘winged word.’ This expression was imprudent, for it gave ignorant\r\nbabblers a pretext, and apparently a right, to talk of exaggeration,\r\nand to contemn experts in nervous and mental diseases, because they\r\nprofessedly saw a lunatic in everyone who ventured to be something more\r\nthan the most ordinary, characterless, average being. Science does\r\nnot assert that every genius is a lunatic; there are some geniuses of\r\nsuperabundant power whose high privilege consists in the possession\r\nof one or other extraordinarily developed faculty, without the rest\r\nof their faculties falling short of the average standard. Just as\r\nlittle, naturally, is every lunatic a genius; most of them, even if\r\nwe disregard idiots of different degrees, are much rather pitiably\r\nstupid and incapable; but in many, nay, in abundant cases, the ‘higher\r\ndegenerate’ of Magnan, just as he occasionally exhibits gigantic bodily\r\nstature or the disproportionate growth of particular parts, has some\r\nmental gift exceptionally developed at the cost, it is true, of the\r\nremaining faculties, which are wholly or partially atrophied.[25] It\r\nis this which enables the well-informed to distinguish at the first\r\nglance between the sane genius, and the highly, or even the most\r\nhighly, gifted degenerate. Take from the former the special capacity\r\nthrough which he becomes a genius, and there still remains a capable,\r\noften conspicuously intelligent, clever, moral, and judicious man,\r\nwho will hold his ground with propriety in our social mechanism. Let\r\nthe same be tried in the case of a degenerate, and there remains only\r\na criminal or madman, for whom healthy humanity can find no use. If\r\nGoethe had never written a line of verse, he would, all the same,\r\nhave still remained a man of the world, of good principles, a fine\r\nart connoisseur, a judicious collector, a keen observer of nature.\r\nLet us, on the contrary, imagine a Schopenhauer who had written no\r\nastounding books, and we should have before us only a repulsive\r\n_lusus naturæ_, whose morals would necessarily exclude him from all\r\nrespectable society, and whose fixed idea that he was a victim of\r\npersecution would point him out as a subject for a madhouse. The\r\nlack of harmony, the absence of balance, the singular incapacity of\r\nusefully applying, or deriving satisfaction from, their own special\r\nfaculty among highly-gifted degenerates, strikes every healthy censor\r\nwho does not allow himself to be prejudiced by the noisy admiration\r\nof critics, themselves degenerates: and will always prevent his\r\nmistaking the mattoid for the same exceptional man who opens out new\r\npaths for humanity and leads it to higher developments. I do not\r\nshare Lombroso’s opinion[26] that highly-gifted degenerates are an\r\nactive force in the progress of mankind. They corrupt and delude;\r\nthey do, alas! frequently exercise a deep influence, but this is\r\nalways a baneful one. It may not be at once remarked, but it will\r\nreveal itself subsequently. If cotemporaries do not recognise it, the\r\nhistorian of morals will point it out _a posteriori_. They, likewise,\r\nare leading men along the paths they themselves have found to new\r\ngoals; but these goals are abysses or waste places. They are guides\r\nto swamps like will-o’-the-wisps, or to ruin like the ratcatcher of\r\nHammelin. Observers lay stress on their unnatural sterility. ‘They\r\nare,’ says Tarabaud,[27] ‘cranks; wrong-headed, unbalanced, incapable\r\ncreatures; they belong to the class of whom it may not be said that\r\nthey have no mind, but whose mind produces nothing.’ ‘A common type,’\r\nwrites Legrain,[28] ‘unites them:--weakness of judgment and unequal\r\ndevelopment of mental powers.... Their conceptions are never of a\r\nhigh order. They are incapable of great thoughts and prolific ideas.\r\nThis fact forms a peculiar contrast to the frequently excessive\r\ndevelopment of their powers of imagination.’ ‘If they are painters,’\r\nwe read in Lombroso,[29] ‘then their predominant attribute will be the\r\ncolour-sense; they will be decorative. If they are poets, they will be\r\nrich in rhyme, brilliant in style, but barren of thought; sometimes\r\nthey will be “decadents.”’\r\n\r\nSuch are the qualities of the most gifted of those who are discovering\r\nnew paths, and are proclaimed by enthusiastic followers as the guides\r\nto the promised land of the future. Among them degenerates and mattoids\r\npredominate. The second of the above-mentioned diagnoses, on the\r\ncontrary, applies for the most part to the multitude who admire these\r\nindividuals and swear by them, who imitate the fashions they design,\r\nand take delight in the extravagances described in the previous\r\nchapter. In their case we have to deal chiefly with hysteria, or\r\nneurasthenia.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which will be elucidated in the next chapter, hysteria has\r\nhitherto been less studied in Germany than in France, where, more than\r\nelsewhere, it has formed a subject of earnest inquiry. We owe what we\r\nknow of it almost exclusively to French investigators. The copious\r\ntreatises of Axenfeld,[30] Richer,[31] and in particular Gilles de la\r\nTourette,[32] adequately comprise our present knowledge of this malady;\r\nand I shall refer to these works when I enumerate the symptoms chiefly\r\nindicative of hysteria.\r\n\r\nAmong the hysterical--and it must not be thought that these are met\r\nwith exclusively, or even preponderantly, among females, for they are\r\nquite as often, perhaps oftener, found among males[33]--among the\r\nhysterical, as among the degenerate, the first thing which strikes us\r\nis an extraordinary emotionalism. ‘The leading characteristic of the\r\nhysterical,’ says Colin,[34] ‘is the disproportionate impressionability\r\nof their psychic centres.... They are, above all things,\r\nimpressionable.’ From this primary peculiarity proceeds a second quite\r\nas remarkable and important--the exceeding ease with which they can be\r\nmade to yield to suggestion.[35] The earlier observers always mentioned\r\nthe boundless mendacity of the hysterical; growing, indeed, quite\r\nindignant at it, and making it the most prominent mark of the mental\r\ncondition of such patients. They were mistaken. The hysterical subject\r\ndoes not consciously lie. He believes in the truth of his craziest\r\ninventions. The morbid mobility of his mind, the excessive excitability\r\nof his imagination, conveys to his consciousness all sorts of queer and\r\nsenseless ideas. He suggests to himself that these ideas are founded on\r\ntrue perceptions, and believes in the truth of his foolish inventions\r\nuntil a new suggestion--perhaps his own, perhaps that of another\r\nperson--has ejected the earlier one. A result of the susceptibility\r\nof the hysterical subject to suggestion is his irresistible passion\r\nfor imitation,[36] and the eagerness with which he yields to all the\r\nsuggestions of writers and artists.[37] When he sees a picture, he\r\nwants to become like it in attitude and dress; when he reads a book,\r\nhe adopts its views blindly. He takes as a pattern the heroes of the\r\nnovels which he has in his hand at the moment, and infuses himself into\r\nthe characters moving before him on the stage.\r\n\r\nAdded to this emotionalism and susceptibility to suggestion is a love\r\nof self never met with in a sane person in anything like the same\r\ndegree. The hysterical person’s own ‘I’ towers up before his inner\r\nvision, and so completely fills his mental horizon that it conceals the\r\nwhole of the remaining universe. He cannot endure that others should\r\nignore him. He desires to be as important to his fellow-men as he is\r\nto himself. ‘An incessant need pursues and governs the hysterical--to\r\nbusy those about them with themselves.’[38] A means of satisfying this\r\nneed is the fabrication of stories by which they become interesting.\r\nHence come the adventurous occurrences which often enough occupy the\r\npolice and the reports of the daily press. In the busiest thoroughfare\r\nthe hysterical person is set upon, robbed, maltreated and wounded,\r\ndragged to a distant place, and left to die. He picks himself up\r\npainfully, and informs the police. He can show the wounds on his body.\r\nHe gives all the details. And there is not a single word of truth\r\nin the whole story; it is all dreamt and imagined. He has himself\r\ninflicted his wounds in order for a short time to become the centre\r\nof public attention. In the lower stages of hysteria this need of\r\nmaking a sensation assumes more harmless forms. It displays itself in\r\neccentricities of dress and behaviour. ‘Other hysterical subjects are\r\npassionately fond of glaring colours and extravagant forms; they wish\r\nto attract attention and make themselves talked about.’[39]\r\n\r\nIt is certainly unnecessary to draw the reader’s attention in a\r\nspecial manner to the complete coincidence of this clinical picture\r\nof hysteria with the description of the peculiarities of the\r\n_fin-de-siècle_ public, and to the fact that in the former we meet\r\nwith all the features made familiar to us by the consideration of\r\ncontemporary phenomena; in particular with the passion for imitating\r\nin externals--in dress, attitude, fashion of the hair and beard--the\r\nfigures in old and modern pictures, and the feverish effort, through\r\nany sort of singularity, to make themselves talked about. The\r\nobservation of pronounced cases of degeneration and hysteria, whose\r\ncondition makes them necessary subjects for medical treatment, gives\r\nus also the key to the comprehension of subordinate details in the\r\nfashions of the day. The present rage for collecting, the piling up,\r\nin dwellings, of aimless bric-à-brac, which does not become any more\r\nuseful or beautiful by being fondly called _bibelots_, appear to us in\r\na completely new light when we know that Magnan has established the\r\nexistence of an irresistible desire among the degenerate to accumulate\r\nuseless trifles. It is so firmly imprinted and so peculiar that Magnan\r\ndeclares it to be a stigma of degeneration, and has invented for it\r\nthe name ‘oniomania,’ or ‘buying craze.’ This is not to be confounded\r\nwith the desire for buying, which possesses those who are in the first\r\nstage of general paralysis. The purchases of these persons are due to\r\ntheir delusion as to their own greatness. They lay in great supplies\r\nbecause they fancy themselves millionaires. The oniomaniac, on the\r\ncontrary, neither buys enormous quantities of one and the same thing,\r\nnor is the price a matter of indifference to him as with the paralytic.\r\nHe is simply unable to pass by any lumber without feeling an impulse to\r\nacquire it.\r\n\r\nThe curious style of certain recent painters--‘impressionists,’\r\n‘stipplers,’ or ‘mosaists,’ ‘papilloteurs’ or ‘quiverers,’ ‘roaring’\r\ncolourists, dyers in gray and faded tints--becomes at once intelligible\r\nto us if we keep in view the researches of the Charcot school into the\r\nvisual derangements in degeneration and hysteria. The painters who\r\nassure us that they are sincere, and reproduce nature as they see it,\r\nspeak the truth. The degenerate artist who suffers from _nystagmus_,\r\nor trembling of the eyeball, will, in fact, perceive the phenomena of\r\nnature trembling, restless, devoid of firm outline, and, if he is a\r\nconscientious painter, will give us pictures reminding us of the mode\r\npractised by the draughtsmen of the _Fliegende Blätter_ when they\r\nrepresent a wet dog shaking himself vigorously. If his pictures fail to\r\nproduce a comic effect, it is only because the attentive beholder reads\r\nin them the desperate effort to reproduce fully an impression incapable\r\nof reproduction by the expedients of the painter’s art as devised by\r\nmen of normal vision.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a hysterical subject whose retina is not partly\r\ninsensitive.[40] As a rule the insensitive parts are connected, and\r\ninclude the outer half of the retina. In these cases the field of\r\nvision is more or less contracted, and appears to him not as it does to\r\nthe normal man--as a circle--but as a picture bordered by whimsically\r\nzigzag lines. Often, however, the insensitive parts are not connected,\r\nbut are scattered in isolated spots over the entire retina. Then the\r\nsufferer will have all sorts of gaps in his field of vision, producing\r\nstrange effects, and if he paints what he sees, he will be inclined\r\nto place in juxtaposition larger or smaller points or spots which\r\nare completely or partially dissociated. The insensitiveness need\r\nnot be complete, and may exist only in the case of single colours,\r\nor of all. If the sensitiveness is completely lost (‘achromatopsy’)\r\nhe then sees everything in a uniform gray, but perceives differences\r\nin the degree of lustre. Hence the picture of nature presents itself\r\nto him as a copper-plate or a pencil drawing--where the effect of\r\nthe absent colours is replaced by differences in the intensity of\r\nlight, by greater or less depth and power of the white and black\r\nportions. Painters who are insensitive to colour will naturally have a\r\npredilection for neutral-toned painting; and a public suffering from\r\nthe same malady will find nothing objectionable in falsely-coloured\r\npictures. But if, besides the whitewash of a Puvis de Chavannes,\r\nobliterating all colours equally, fanatics are found for the screaming\r\nyellow, blue, and red of a Besnard, this also has a cause, revealed to\r\nus by clinical science. ‘Yellow and blue,’ Gilles de la Tourette[41]\r\nteaches us, ‘are peripheral colours’ (_i.e._, they are seen with\r\nthe outermost parts of the retina); ‘they are, therefore, the last\r\nto be perceived’ (if the sensitiveness for the remaining colours is\r\ndestroyed). ‘These are ... the very two colours the sensations of which\r\nin hysterical amblyopia [dulness of vision] endure the longest. In many\r\ncases, however, it is the red, and not the blue, which vanishes last.’\r\n\r\nRed has also another peculiarity explanatory of the predilection\r\nshown for it by the hysterical. The experiments of Binet[42] have\r\nestablished that the impressions conveyed to the brain by the sensory\r\nnerves exercise an important influence on the species and strength\r\nof the excitation distributed by the brain to the motor nerves.\r\nMany sense-impressions operate enervatingly and inhibitively on the\r\nmovements; others, on the contrary, make these more powerful, rapid and\r\nactive; they are ‘dynamogenous,’ or ‘force-producing.’ As a feeling\r\nof pleasure is always connected with dynamogeny, or the production\r\nof force, every living thing, therefore, instinctively seeks for\r\ndynamogenous sense-impressions, and avoids enervating and inhibitive\r\nones. Now, red is especially dynamogenous. ‘When,’ says Binet,[43]\r\nin a report of an experiment on a female hysterical subject who was\r\nparalyzed in one half of her body, ‘we place a dynamometer in the\r\nanæsthetically insensible right hand of Amélie Cle.... the pressure of\r\nthe hand amounts to 12 kilogrammes. If at the same time she is made to\r\nlook at a red disc, the number indicating the pressure in kilogrammes\r\nis at once doubled.’ Hence it is intelligible that hysterical painters\r\nrevel in red, and that hysterical beholders take special pleasure in\r\npictures operating dynamogenously, and producing feelings of pleasure.\r\n\r\nIf red is dynamogenous, violet is conversely enervating and\r\ninhibitive.[44] It was not by accident that violet was chosen by\r\nmany nations as the exclusive colour for mourning, and by us also\r\nfor half-mourning. The sight of this colour has a depressing effect,\r\nand the unpleasant feeling awakened by it induces dejection in a\r\nsorrowfully-disposed mind. This suggests that painters suffering from\r\nhysteria and neurasthenia will be inclined to cover their pictures\r\nuniformly with the colour most in accordance with their condition of\r\nlassitude and exhaustion. Thus originate the violet pictures of Manet\r\nand his school, which spring from no actually observable aspect of\r\nnature, but from a subjective view due to the condition of the nerves.\r\nWhen the entire surface of walls in salons and art exhibitions of the\r\nday appears veiled in uniform half-mourning, this predilection for\r\nviolet is simply an expression of the nervous debility of the painter.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another phenomenon highly characteristic in some cases\r\nof degeneracy, in others of hysteria. This is the formation of close\r\ngroups or schools uncompromisingly exclusive to outsiders, observable\r\nto-day in literature and art. Healthy artists or authors, in possession\r\nof minds in a condition of well-regulated equilibrium, will never think\r\nof grouping themselves into an association, which may at pleasure be\r\ntermed a sect or band; of devising a catechism, of binding themselves\r\nto definite æsthetic dogmas, and of entering the lists for these\r\nwith the fanatical intolerance of Spanish inquisitors. If any human\r\nactivity is individualistic, it is that of the artist. True talent\r\nis always personal. In its creations it reproduces itself, its own\r\nviews and feelings, and not the articles of faith learnt from any\r\næsthetic apostle; it follows its creative impulses, not a theoretical\r\nformula preached by the founder of a new artistic or literary church;\r\nit constructs its work in the form organically necessary to it, not\r\nin that proclaimed by a leader as demanded by the fashion of the day.\r\nThe mere fact that an artist or author allows himself to be sworn in\r\nto the party cry of any ‘ism,’ that he perambulates with jubilations\r\nbehind a banner and Turkish music, is complete evidence of his lack\r\nof individuality--that is, of talent. If the mental movements of a\r\nperiod--even those which are healthy and prolific--range themselves,\r\nas a rule, under certain main tendencies, which receive each its\r\ndistinguishing name, this is the work of historians of civilization or\r\nliterature, who subsequently survey the combined picture of an epoch,\r\nand for their own convenience undertake divisions and classifications,\r\nin order that they may more correctly find their way among the\r\nmultifariousness of the phenomena. These are, however, almost always\r\narbitrary and artificial. Independent minds (we are not here speaking\r\nof mere imitators), united by a good critic into a group, may, it is\r\ntrue, have a certain resemblance to each other, but, as a rule, this\r\nresemblance will be the consequence, not of actual internal affinity,\r\nbut of external influences. No one is able completely to withdraw\r\nhimself from the influences of his time, and under the impression\r\nof events which affect all contemporaries alike, as well as of the\r\nscientific views prevailing at a given time, certain features develop\r\nthemselves in all the works of an epoch, which stamp them as of the\r\nsame date. But the same men who subsequently appear so naturally in\r\neach other’s company, in historical works, that they seem to form a\r\nfamily, went when they lived their separate ways far asunder, little\r\nsuspecting that at one time they would be united under one common\r\ndesignation. Quite otherwise it is when authors or artists consciously\r\nand intentionally meet together and found an æsthetic school, as a\r\njoint-stock bank is founded, with a title for which, if possible, the\r\nprotection of the law is claimed, with by-laws, joint capital, etc.\r\nThis may be ordinary speculation, but as a rule it is disease. The\r\npredilection for forming societies met with among all the degenerate\r\nand hysterical may assume different forms. Criminals unite in bands, as\r\nLombroso expressly establishes.[45] Among pronounced lunatics it is the\r\n_folie à deux_, in which a deranged person completely forces his insane\r\nideas on a companion; among the hysterical it assumes the form of close\r\nfriendships, causing Charcot to repeat at every opportunity: ‘Persons\r\nof highly-strung nerves attract each other;’[46] and finally authors\r\nfound schools.\r\n\r\nThe common organic basis of these different forms of one and the same\r\nphenomenon--of the _folie à deux_, the association of neuropaths,\r\nthe founding of æsthetic schools, the banding of criminals--is, with\r\nthe active part, viz., those who lead and inspire, the predominance\r\nof obsessions: with the associates, the disciples, the submissive\r\npart, weakness of will and morbid susceptibility to suggestion.[47]\r\nThe possessor of an obsession is an incomparable apostle. There is no\r\nrational conviction arrived at by sound labour of intellect, which so\r\ncompletely takes possession of the mind, subjugates so tyrannically\r\nits entire activity, and so irresistibly impels it to words and deeds,\r\nas delirium. Every proof of the senselessness of his ideas rebounds\r\nfrom the deliriously insane or half-crazy person. No contradiction,\r\nno ridicule, no contempt, affects him; the opinion of the majority\r\nis to him a matter of indifference; facts which do not please him\r\nhe does not notice, or so interprets that they seem to support his\r\ndelirium; obstacles do not discourage him, because even his instinct\r\nof self-preservation is unable to cope with the power of his delirium,\r\nand for the same reason he is often enough ready, without further ado,\r\nto suffer martyrdom. Weak-minded or mentally-unbalanced persons, coming\r\ninto contact with a man possessed by delirium, are at once conquered\r\nby the strength of his diseased ideas, and are converted to them. By\r\nseparating them from the source of inspiration, it is often possible to\r\ncure them of their transmitted delirium, but frequently their acquired\r\nderangement outlasts this separation.\r\n\r\nThis is the natural history of the æsthetic schools. Under the\r\ninfluence of an obsession, a degenerate mind promulgates some doctrine\r\nor other--realism, pornography, mysticism, symbolism, diabolism. He\r\ndoes this with vehement penetrating eloquence, with eagerness and\r\nfiery heedlessness. Other degenerate, hysterical, neurasthenical minds\r\nflock around him, receive from his lips the new doctrine, and live\r\nthenceforth only to propagate it.\r\n\r\nIn this case all the participants are sincere--the founder as well as\r\nthe disciples. They act as, in consequence of the diseased constitution\r\nof their brain and nervous system, they are compelled to act. The\r\npicture, however, which from a clinical standpoint is perfectly\r\nclear, gets dimmed if the apostle of a craze and his followers\r\nsucceed in attracting to themselves the attention of wider circles.\r\nHe then receives a concourse of unbelievers, who are very well able\r\nto recognise the insanity of the new doctrine, but who nevertheless\r\naccept it, because they hope, as associates of the new sect, to acquire\r\nfame and money. In every civilized nation which has a developed art\r\nand literature there are numerous intellectual eunuchs, incapable\r\nof producing with their own powers a living mental work, but quite\r\nable to imitate the process of production. These cripples form,\r\nunfortunately, the majority of professional authors and artists, and\r\ntheir many noxious followers often enough stifle true and original\r\ntalent. Now it is these who hasten to act as camp-followers for every\r\nnew tendency which seems to come into fashion. They are naturally the\r\nmost modern of moderns, for no precept of individuality, no artistic\r\nknowledge, hinders them from bunglingly imitating the newest model\r\nwith all the assiduity of an artisan. Clever in discerning externals,\r\nunscrupulous copyists and plagiarists, they crowd round every original\r\nphenomenon, be it healthy or unhealthy, and without loss of time\r\nset about disseminating counterfeit copies of it. To-day they are\r\nsymbolists, as yesterday they were realists or pornographists. If they\r\ncan promise themselves fame and a good sale, they write of mysteries\r\nwith the same fluency as if they were spinning romances of knights and\r\nrobbers, tales of adventure, Roman tragedies, and village stories at\r\na time when newspaper critics and the public seemed to demand these\r\nthings in preference to others. Now these practitioners, who, let it\r\nbe again asserted, constitute the great majority of the mental workers\r\nof the fashionable sects in art and literature, and therefore of the\r\nassociates of these sects also, are intellectually quite sane, even\r\nif they stand at a very low level of development, and were anyone to\r\nexamine them, he might easily doubt the accuracy of the diagnosis\r\n‘Degeneration’ as regards the confessors of the new doctrines. Hence\r\nsome caution must be exercised in the inquiry, and the sincere\r\noriginators be always distinguished from the aping intriguers,--the\r\nfounder of the religion and his apostles from the rabble to whom the\r\nSermon on the Mount is of less concern than the miraculous draught of\r\nfishes and the multiplication of loaves.\r\n\r\nIt has now been shown how schools originate. They arise from the\r\ndegeneration of their founders and of the imitators they have\r\nconvinced. That they come into fashion, and for a short time attain a\r\nnoisy success, is due to the peculiarities of the recipient public,\r\nnamely, to hysteria. We have seen that hypersusceptibility to\r\nsuggestion is the distinguishing characteristic of hysteria. The same\r\npower of obsession with which the degenerate in mind wins imitators,\r\ngathers round him adherents. When a hysterical person is loudly and\r\nunceasingly assured that a work is beautiful, deep, pregnant with the\r\nfuture, he believes in it. He believes in everything suggested to him\r\nwith sufficient impressiveness. When the little cow-girl, Bernadette,\r\nsaw the vision of the Holy Virgin in the grotto of Lourdes, the\r\nwomen devotees and hysterical males of the surrounding country who\r\nflocked thither did not merely believe that the hallucinant maiden\r\nhad herself seen the vision, but all of them saw the Holy Virgin\r\nwith their own eyes. M. E. de Goncourt[48] relates that in 1870,\r\nduring the Franco-Prussian War, a multitude of men, numbering tens\r\nof thousands, in and before the Bourse in Paris, were convinced that\r\nthey had themselves seen--indeed, a part of them had read--a telegram\r\nannouncing French victories fastened to a pillar inside the Exchange,\r\nand at which people were pointing with their finger; but as a matter\r\nof fact it never existed. It would be possible to cite examples by\r\nthe dozen, of illusions of the senses suggested to excited crowds.\r\nThus the hysterical allow themselves without more ado to be convinced\r\nof the magnificence of a work, and even find in it beauties of the\r\nhighest kind, unthought of by the authors themselves and the appointed\r\ntrumpeters of their fame. If the sect is so completely established\r\nthat, in addition to the founders, the priests of the temple, the paid\r\nsacristans and choir-boys, it has a congregation, processions, and\r\nfar-sounding bells, it then attaches to itself other converts besides\r\nthe hysterical who have accepted the new belief by way of suggestion.\r\nYoung persons without judgment, still seeking their way, go whither\r\nthey see the multitude streaming, and unhesitatingly follow the\r\nprocession, because they believe it to be marching on the right road.\r\nSuperficial persons, fearing nothing so much as to be thought behind\r\nthe times, attach themselves to the procession, shouting ‘Hurrah!’ and\r\n‘All hail!’ so as to convince themselves that they also are really\r\ndancing along before the latest conqueror and newest celebrity.\r\nDecrepit gray-beards, filled with a ridiculous dread of betraying their\r\nreal age, eagerly visit the new temple and mingle their quavering\r\nvoices in the song of the devout, because they hope to be thought young\r\nwhen seen in an assembly in which young persons predominate.\r\n\r\nThus a regular concourse is established about a victim of degeneration.\r\nThe fashionable coxcomb, the æsthetic ‘gigerl,’[49] peeps over the\r\nshoulder of the hysterical whose admiration has been suggested to him;\r\nthe intriguer marches at the heel of the dotard, simulating youth; and\r\nbetween all these comes pushing the inquisitive young street-loafer,\r\nwho must always be in every place where ‘something is going on.’ And\r\nthis crowd, because it is driven by disease, self-interest and vanity,\r\nmakes very much more noise and bustle than a far larger number of sane\r\nmen, who, without self-seeking after-thought, take quiet enjoyment\r\nin works of sane talent, and do not feel obliged to shout out their\r\nappreciation in the streets, and to threaten with death harmless\r\npassers-by who do not join in their jubilations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have recognised the effect of diseases in these _fin-de-siècle_\r\nliterary and artistic tendencies and fashions, as well as in the\r\nsusceptibility of the public with regard to them, and we have succeeded\r\nin maintaining that these diseases are degeneracy and hysteria. We have\r\nnow to inquire how these maladies of the day have originated, and why\r\nthey appear with such extraordinary frequency at the present time.\r\n\r\nMorel,[50] the great investigator of degeneracy, traces this chiefly\r\nto poisoning. A race which is regularly addicted, even without excess,\r\nto narcotics and stimulants in any form (such as fermented alcoholic\r\ndrinks, tobacco, opium, hashish, arsenic), which partakes of tainted\r\nfoods (bread made with bad corn), which absorbs organic poisons (marsh\r\nfever, syphilis, tuberculosis, goitre), begets degenerate descendants\r\nwho, if they remain exposed to the same influences, rapidly descend\r\nto the lowest degrees of degeneracy, to idiocy, to dwarfishness, etc.\r\nThat the poisoning of civilized peoples continues and increases at a\r\nvery rapid rate is widely attested by statistics.[51] The consumption\r\nof tobacco has risen in France from 0.8 kilogramme per head in 1841\r\nto 1.9 kilogrammes in 1890. The corresponding figures for England\r\nare 13 and 26 ounces;[52] for Germany, 0.8 and 1.5 kilogrammes. The\r\nconsumption of alcohol[53] during the same period has risen in\r\nGermany (1844) from 5.45 quarts to (1867) 6.86 quarts; in England\r\nfrom 2.01 litres to 2.64 litres; in France from 1.33 to 4 litres. The\r\nincrease in the consumption of opium and hashish is still greater, but\r\nwe need not concern ourselves about that, since the chief sufferers\r\nfrom them are Eastern peoples, who play no part in the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the white races. To these noxious influences, however,\r\none more may be added, which Morel has not known, or has not taken into\r\nconsideration--residence in large towns. The inhabitant of a large\r\ntown, even the richest, who is surrounded by the greatest luxury, is\r\ncontinually exposed to unfavourable influences which diminish his vital\r\npowers far more than what is inevitable. He breathes an atmosphere\r\ncharged with organic detritus; he eats stale, contaminated, adulterated\r\nfood; he feels himself in a state of constant nervous excitement, and\r\none can compare him without exaggeration to the inhabitant of a marshy\r\ndistrict. The effect of a large town on the human organism offers the\r\nclosest analogy to that of the Maremma, and its population falls victim\r\nto the same fatality of degeneracy and destruction as the victims\r\nof malaria. The death-rate in a large town is more than a quarter\r\ngreater than the average for the entire population; it is double that\r\nof the open country, though in reality it ought to be less, since in\r\na large town the most vigorous ages predominate, during which the\r\nmortality is lower than in infancy and old age.[54] And the children\r\nof large towns who are not carried off at an early age suffer from the\r\npeculiar arrested development which Morel[55] has ascertained in the\r\npopulation of fever districts. They develop more or less normally until\r\nfourteen or fifteen years of age, are up to that time alert, sometimes\r\nbrilliantly endowed, and give the highest promise; then suddenly there\r\nis a standstill, the mind loses its facility of comprehension, and the\r\nboy who, only yesterday, was a model scholar, becomes an obtuse, clumsy\r\ndunce, who can only be steered with the greatest difficulty through\r\nhis examinations. With these mental changes bodily modifications go\r\nhand in hand. The growth of the long bones is extremely slow, or ceases\r\nentirely, the legs remain short, the pelvis retains a feminine form,\r\ncertain other organs cease to develop, and the entire being presents a\r\nstrange and repulsive mixture of incompleteness and decay.[56]\r\n\r\nNow we know how, in the last generation, the number of the inhabitants\r\nof great towns increased[57] to an extraordinary degree. At the\r\npresent time an incomparably larger portion of the whole population is\r\nsubjected to the destructive influences of large towns than was the\r\ncase fifty years ago; hence the number of victims is proportionately\r\nmore striking, and continually becomes more remarkable. Parallel\r\nwith the growth of large towns is the increase in the number of\r\nthe degenerate of all kinds--criminals, lunatics, and the ‘higher\r\ndegenerates’ of Magnan; and it is natural that these last should play\r\nan ever more prominent part in endeavouring to introduce an ever\r\ngreater element of insanity into art and literature.\r\n\r\nThe enormous increase of hysteria in our days is partly due to the\r\nsame causes as degeneracy, besides which there is one cause much more\r\ngeneral still than the growth of large towns--a cause which perhaps of\r\nitself would not be sufficient to bring about degeneracy, but which\r\nis unquestionably quite enough to produce hysteria and neurasthenia.\r\nThis cause is the fatigue of the present generation. That hysteria is\r\nin reality a consequence of fatigue Féré has conclusively demonstrated\r\nby convincing experiments. In a communication to the Biological\r\nSociety of Paris, this distinguished investigator says:[58] ‘I have\r\nrecently observed a certain number of facts which have made apparent\r\nthe analogy existing between fatigue and the chronic condition of the\r\nhysterical. One knows that among the hysterical [involuntary!] symmetry\r\nof movements frequently shows itself in a very characteristic manner.\r\nI have proved that in normal subjects this same symmetry of movements\r\nis met with under the influence of fatigue. A phenomenon which shows\r\nitself in a very marked way in serious hysteria is that peculiar\r\nexcitability which demonstrates that the energy of the voluntary\r\nmovements, through peripheral stimulations or mental presentations,\r\nsuffers rapid and transitory modifications co-existing with parallel\r\nmodifications of sensibility, and of the functions of nutrition. This\r\nexcitability can be equally manifested during fatigue.... Fatigue\r\nconstitutes a true temporary experimental hysteria. It establishes a\r\ntransition between the states which we call normal and the various\r\nstates which we designate hysteria. One can change a normal into a\r\nhysterical individual by tiring him.... All these causes (which produce\r\nhysteria) can, as far as the pathogenic part they play is concerned, be\r\ntraced to one simple physiological process--to fatigue, to depression\r\nof vitality.’\r\n\r\nNow, to this cause--fatigue--which, according to Féré, changes healthy\r\nmen into hysterical, the whole of civilized humanity has been exposed\r\nfor half a century. All its conditions of life have, in this period\r\nof time, experienced a revolution unexampled in the history of the\r\nworld. Humanity can point to no century in which the inventions which\r\npenetrate so deeply, so tyrannically, into the life of every individual\r\nare crowded so thick as in ours. The discovery of America, the\r\nReformation, stirred men’s minds powerfully, no doubt, and certainly\r\nalso destroyed the equilibrium of thousands of brains which lacked\r\nstaying power. But they did not change the material life of man. He\r\ngot up and laid down, ate and drank, dressed, amused himself, passed\r\nhis days and years as he had been always wont to do. In our times, on\r\nthe contrary, steam and electricity have turned the customs of life of\r\nevery member of the civilized nations upside down, even of the most\r\nobtuse and narrow-minded citizen, who is completely inaccessible to the\r\nimpelling thoughts of the times.\r\n\r\nIn an exceptionally remarkable lecture by Professor A. W. von Hofmann,\r\nin 1890, before the Congress of German Natural Science held in\r\nBremen, he gave, in concluding, a short description of the life of\r\nan inhabitant of a town in the year 1822. He shows us a student of\r\nscience who at that date is arriving with the coach from Bremen to\r\nLeipzig. The journey has lasted four days and four nights, and the\r\ntraveller is naturally stiff and bruised. His friends receive him,\r\nand he wishes to refresh himself a little. But there is yet no Munich\r\nbeer in Leipzig. After a short interview with his comrades, he goes in\r\nsearch of his inn. This is no easy task, for in the streets an Egyptian\r\ndarkness reigns, broken only at long distances by the smoky flame of\r\nan oil-lamp. He at last finds his quarters, and wishes for a light. As\r\nmatches do not yet exist, he is reduced to bruising the tips of his\r\nfingers with flint and steel, till he succeeds at last in lighting a\r\ntallow candle. He expects a letter, but it has not come, and he cannot\r\nnow receive it till after some days, for the post only runs twice a\r\nweek between Frankfort and Leipzig.[59]\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to go back to the year 1822, chosen by Professor\r\nHofmann. Let us stop, for purposes of comparison, at the year 1840.\r\nThis year has not been arbitrarily selected. It is about the date when\r\nthat generation was born which has witnessed the irruption of new\r\ndiscoveries in every relation of life, and thus personally experienced\r\nthose transformations which are the consequences. This generation\r\nreigns and governs to-day; it sets the tone everywhere, and its sons\r\nand daughters are the youth of Europe and America, in whom the new\r\næsthetic tendencies gain their fanatical partisans. Let us now compare\r\nhow things went on in the civilized world in 1840 and a half-century\r\nlater.[60]\r\n\r\nIn 1840 there were in Europe 3,000 kilometres of railway; in 1891\r\nthere were 218,000 kilometres. The number of travellers in 1840, in\r\nGermany, France and England, amounted to 2-1/2 millions; in 1891 it\r\nwas 614 millions. In Germany every inhabitant received, in 1840, 85\r\nletters; in 1888, 200 letters. In 1840 the post distributed in France\r\n94 millions of letters; in England, 277 millions; in 1881, 595 and\r\n1,299 millions respectively. The collective postal intercourse between\r\nall countries, without including the internal postage of each separate\r\ncountry, amounted, in 1840, to 92 millions; in 1889, to 2,759 millions.\r\nIn Germany, in 1840, 305 newspapers were published; in 1891, 6,800; in\r\nFrance, 776 and 5,182; in England (1846), 551 and 2,255. The German\r\nbook trade produced, in 1840, 1,100 new works; in 1891, 18,700. The\r\nexports and imports of the world had, in 1840, a value of 28, in 1889\r\nof 74, milliards of marks. The ships which, in 1840, entered all the\r\nports of Great Britain contained 9-1/2, in 1890 74-1/2, millions of\r\ntons. The whole British merchant navy measured, in 1840, 3,200,000; in\r\n1890, 9,688,000 tons.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider how these formidable figures arise. The 18,000\r\nnew publications, the 6,800 newspapers in Germany, desire to be read,\r\nalthough many of them desire in vain; the 2,759 millions of letters\r\nmust be written; the larger commercial transactions, the numerous\r\njourneys, the increased marine intercourse, imply a correspondingly\r\ngreater activity in individuals. The humblest village inhabitant\r\nhas to-day a wider geographical horizon, more numerous and complex\r\nintellectual interests, than the prime minister of a petty, or even a\r\nsecond-rate state a century ago. If he do but read his paper, let it\r\nbe the most innocent provincial rag, he takes part, certainly not by\r\nactive interference and influence, but by a continuous and receptive\r\ncuriosity, in the thousand events which take place in all parts of\r\nthe globe, and he interests himself simultaneously in the issue of a\r\nrevolution in Chili, in a bush-war in East Africa, a massacre in North\r\nChina, a famine in Russia, a street-row in Spain, and an international\r\nexhibition in North America. A cook receives and sends more letters\r\nthan a university professor did formerly, and a petty tradesman travels\r\nmore and sees more countries and people than did the reigning prince of\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nAll these activities, however, even the simplest, involve an effort\r\nof the nervous system and a wearing of tissue. Every line we read or\r\nwrite, every human face we see, every conversation we carry on, every\r\nscene we perceive through the window of the flying express, sets in\r\nactivity our sensory nerves and our brain centres. Even the little\r\nshocks of railway travelling, not perceived by consciousness, the\r\nperpetual noises, and the various sights in the streets of a large\r\ntown, our suspense pending the sequel of progressing events, the\r\nconstant expectation of the newspaper, of the postman, of visitors,\r\ncost our brains wear and tear. In the last fifty years the population\r\nof Europe has not doubled, whereas the sum of its labours has increased\r\ntenfold, in part even fifty-fold. Every civilized man furnishes, at\r\nthe present time, from five to twenty-five times as much work as was\r\ndemanded of him half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThis enormous increase in organic expenditure has not, and cannot have,\r\na corresponding increase of supply. Europeans now eat a little more\r\nand a little better than they did fifty years ago, but by no means in\r\nproportion to the increase of effort which to-day is required of them.\r\nAnd even if they had the choicest food in the greatest abundance, it\r\nwould do nothing towards helping them, for they would be incapable of\r\ndigesting it. Our stomachs cannot keep pace with the brain and nervous\r\nsystem. The latter demand very much more than the former are able to\r\nperform. And so there follows what always happens if great expenses\r\nare met by small incomes; first the savings are consumed, then comes\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIts own new discoveries and progress have taken civilized humanity by\r\nsurprise. It has had no time to adapt itself to its changed conditions\r\nof life. We know that our organs acquire by exercise an ever greater\r\nfunctional capacity, that they develop by their own activity, and can\r\nrespond to nearly every demand made upon them; but only under one\r\ncondition--that this occurs gradually, that time be allowed them. If\r\nthey are obliged to fulfil, without transition, a multiple of their\r\nusual task, they soon give out entirely. No time was left to our\r\nfathers. Between one day and the next, as it were, without preparation,\r\nwith murderous suddenness, they were obliged to change the comfortable\r\ncreeping gait of their former existence for the stormy stride of modern\r\nlife, and their heart and lungs could not bear it. The strongest could\r\nkeep up, no doubt, and even now, at the most rapid pace, no longer lose\r\ntheir breath, but the less vigorous soon fell out right and left, and\r\nfill to-day the ditches on the road of progress.\r\n\r\nTo speak without metaphor, statistics indicate in what measure the sum\r\nof work of civilized humanity has increased during the half-century.\r\nIt had not quite grown to this increased effort. It grew fatigued and\r\nexhausted, and this fatigue and exhaustion showed themselves in the\r\nfirst generation, under the form of acquired hysteria; in the second,\r\nas hereditary hysteria.\r\n\r\nThe new æsthetic schools and their success are a form of this general\r\nhysteria; but they are far from being the only one. The malady of\r\nthe period shows itself in yet many other phenomena which can be\r\nmeasured and counted, and thus are susceptible of being scientifically\r\nestablished. And these positive and unambiguous symptoms of exhaustion\r\nare well adapted to enlighten the ignorant, who might believe at first\r\nsight that the specialist acts arbitrarily in tracing back fashionable\r\ntendencies in art and literature to states of fatigue in civilized\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nIt has become a commonplace to speak of the constant increase of crime,\r\nmadness and suicide. In 1840, in Prussia, out of 100,000 persons of\r\ncriminally responsible age, there were 714 convictions; in 1888, 1,102\r\n(from a letter communicated by the Prussian bureau of statistics). In\r\n1865, in every 10,000 Europeans there were 63 suicides; in 1883, 109;\r\nand since that time the number has increased considerably. In the last\r\ntwenty years a number of new nervous diseases have been discovered and\r\nnamed.[61] Let it not be believed that they always existed, and were\r\nmerely overlooked. If they had been met with anywhere they would have\r\nbeen detected, for even if the theories which prevailed in medicine at\r\nvarious periods were erroneous, there have always been perspicacious\r\nand attentive physicians who knew how to observe. If, then, the\r\nnew nervous diseases were not noticed, it is because they did not\r\nformerly appear. And they are exclusively a consequence of the present\r\nconditions of civilized life. Many affections of the nervous system\r\nalready bear a name which implies that they are a direct consequence of\r\ncertain influences of modern civilization. The terms ‘railway-spine’\r\nand ‘railway-brain,’ which the English and American pathologists have\r\ngiven to certain states of these organs, show that they recognise\r\nthem as due partly to the effects of railway accidents, partly to\r\nthe constant vibrations undergone in railway travelling. Again, the\r\ngreat increase in the consumption of narcotics and stimulants, which\r\nhas been shown in the figures above, has its origin unquestionably\r\nin the exhausted systems with which the age abounds. There is here a\r\ndisastrous, vicious circle of reciprocal effects. The drinker (and\r\napparently the smoker also) begets enfeebled children, hereditarily\r\nfatigued or degenerated, and these drink and smoke in their turn,\r\nbecause they are fatigued. These crave for a stimulus, for a\r\nmomentary, artificial invigoration, or an alleviation of their painful\r\nexcitability, and then, when they recognise that this increases, in the\r\nlong-run, their exhaustion as well as their excitability, they cannot,\r\nthrough weakness of will, resist those habits.[62]\r\n\r\nMany observers assert that the present generation ages much more\r\nrapidly than the preceding one. Sir James Crichton-Browne points out\r\nthis effect of modern circumstances on contemporaries in his speech at\r\nthe opening of the winter term, 1891, before the medical faculty of\r\nthe Victoria University.[63] From 1859 to 1863 there died in England,\r\nof heart-disease, 92,181 persons; from 1884 to 1888, 224,102. Nervous\r\ncomplaints carried off from 1864 to 1868, 196,000 persons; from 1884\r\nto 1888, 260,558. The difference of figures would have been still more\r\nstriking if Sir James had chosen a more remote period for comparison\r\nwith the present, for in 1865 the high pressure under which the English\r\nworked was already nearly as great as in 1885. The dead carried off by\r\nheart and nerve diseases are the victims of civilization. The heart\r\nand nervous system first break down under the overstrain. Sir James\r\nin his speech says further on: ‘Men and women grow old before their\r\ntime. Old age encroaches upon the period of vigorous manhood.... Deaths\r\ndue exclusively to old age are found reported now between the ages of\r\nforty-five and fifty-five....’ Mr. Critchett (an eminent oculist) says:\r\n‘My own experience, which extends now over a quarter of a century,\r\nleads me to believe that men and women, in the present day, seek\r\nthe aid of spectacles at a less advanced period of life than their\r\nancestors.... Previously men had recourse to spectacles at the age of\r\nfifty. The average age is now forty-five years.’ Dentists assert that\r\nteeth decay and fall out at an earlier age than formerly. Dr. Lieving\r\nattests the same respecting the hair, and assures us that precocious\r\nbaldness is to be specially observed ‘among persons of nervous\r\ntemperaments and active mind, but of weak general health.’ Everyone who\r\nlooks round the circle of his friends and acquaintances will remark\r\nthat the hair begins to turn gray much sooner than in former days. Most\r\nmen and women show their first white hairs at the beginning of the\r\nthirties, many of them at a very much younger age. Formerly white hair\r\nwas the accompaniment of the fiftieth year.\r\n\r\nAll the symptoms enumerated are the consequences of states of fatigue\r\nand exhaustion, and these, again, are the effect of contemporary\r\ncivilization, of the vertigo and whirl of our frenzied life, the\r\nvastly increased number of sense impressions and organic reactions,\r\nand therefore of perceptions, judgments, and motor impulses, which at\r\npresent are forced into a given unity of time. To this general cause\r\nof contemporary pathological phenomena, one may be added special to\r\nFrance. By the frightful loss of blood which the body of the French\r\npeople suffered during the twenty years of the Napoleonic wars, by\r\nthe violent moral upheavals to which they were subjected in the\r\ngreat Revolution and during the imperial epic, they found themselves\r\nexceedingly ill-prepared for the impact of the great discoveries of the\r\ncentury, and sustained by these a more violent shock than other nations\r\nmore robust and more capable of resistance. Upon this nation, nervously\r\nstrained and predestined to morbid derangement, there broke the awful\r\ncatastrophe of 1870. It had, with a self-satisfaction which almost\r\nattained to megalomania, believed itself the first nation in the world;\r\nit now saw itself suddenly humiliated and crushed. All its convictions\r\nabruptly crumbled to pieces. Every single Frenchman suffered reverses\r\nof fortune, lost some members of his family, and felt himself\r\npersonally robbed of his dearest conceptions, nay, even of his honour.\r\nThe whole people fell into the condition of a man suddenly visited by a\r\ncrushing blow of destiny, in his fortune, his position, his family, his\r\nreputation, even in his self-respect. Thousands lost their reason. In\r\nParis a veritable epidemic of mental diseases was observed, for which\r\na special name was found--_la folie obsidionale_, ‘siege-madness.’ And\r\neven those who did not at once succumb to mental derangement, suffered\r\nlasting injury to their nervous system. This explains why hysteria and\r\nneurasthenia are much more frequent in France, and appear under such a\r\ngreater variety of forms, and why they can be studied far more closely\r\nin this country than anywhere else. But it explains, too, that it is\r\nprecisely in France that the craziest fashions in art and literature\r\nwould necessarily arise, and that it is precisely there that the\r\nmorbid exhaustion of which we have spoken became for the first time\r\nsufficiently distinct to consciousness to allow a special name to be\r\ncoined for it, namely, the designation of _fin-de-siècle_.\r\n\r\nThe proposition which I set myself to prove may now be taken as\r\ndemonstrated. In the civilized world there obviously prevails a\r\ntwilight mood which finds expression, amongst other ways, in all\r\nsorts of odd æsthetic fashions. All these new tendencies, realism or\r\nnaturalism, ‘decadentism,’ neo-mysticism, and their sub-varieties,\r\nare manifestations of degeneration and hysteria, and identical\r\nwith the mental stigmata which the observations of clinicists have\r\nunquestionably established as belonging to these. But both degeneration\r\nand hysteria are the consequences of the excessive organic wear and\r\ntear suffered by the nations through the immense demands on their\r\nactivity, and through the rank growth of large towns.\r\n\r\nLed by this firmly linked chain of causes and effects, everyone capable\r\nof logical thought will recognise that he commits a serious error if,\r\nin the æsthetic schools which have sprung up in the last few years, he\r\nsees the heralds of a new era. They do not direct us to the future,\r\nbut point backwards to times past. Their word is no ecstatic prophecy,\r\nbut the senseless stammering and babbling of deranged minds, and what\r\nthe ignorant hold to be the outbursts of gushing, youthful vigour and\r\nturbulent constructive impulses are really nothing but the convulsions\r\nand spasms of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nWe should not allow ourselves to be deceived by certain catch-words,\r\nfrequently uttered in the works of these professed innovators. They\r\ntalk of socialism, of emancipation of the mind, etc., and thereby\r\ncreate the outward show of being deeply imbued with the thoughts and\r\nstruggles of the times. But this is empty sham. The catch-words in\r\nvogue are scattered through the works without internal sequence, and\r\nthe struggles of the times are merely painted on the outside. It is\r\na phenomenon observed in every kind of mania, that it receives its\r\nspecial colouring from the degree of culture of the invalid, and from\r\nthe views prevailing at the times in which he lived. The Catholic who\r\nis a prey to megalomania fancies he is the Pope; the Jew, that he is\r\nthe Messiah; the German, that he is the Emperor or a field-marshal;\r\nthe Frenchman, that he is the President of the Republic. In the\r\npersecution-mania, the invalid of former days complained of the\r\nwickedness and knavery of magicians and witches; to-day he grumbles\r\nbecause his imaginary enemies send electric streams through his nerves,\r\nand torment him with magnetism. The degenerates of to-day chatter of\r\nSocialism and Darwinism, because these words, and, in the best case,\r\nthe ideas connected with these, are in current use. These so-called\r\nsocialist and free-thinking works of the degenerate as little advance\r\nthe development of society towards more equitable economic forms, and\r\nmore rational views of the relations among phenomena, as the complaints\r\nand descriptions of an individual suffering from persecution-mania,\r\nand who holds electricity responsible for his disagreeable sensations,\r\nadvance the knowledge of this force of nature. Those obscure or\r\nsuperficially verbose works which pretend to offer solutions for\r\nthe serious questions of our times, or, at least, to prepare the\r\nway thereto, are even impediments and causes of delay, because they\r\nbewilder weak or unschooled brains, suggest to them erroneous views,\r\nand make them either more inaccessible to rational information or\r\naltogether closed to it.\r\n\r\nThe reader is now placed at those points of view whence he can see the\r\nnew æsthetic tendencies in their true light and their real shape. It\r\nwill be the task of the following books to demonstrate the pathological\r\ncharacter of each one of these tendencies, and to inquire what\r\nparticular species of degenerate delirium or hysterical psychological\r\nprocess they are related to or identical with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n_MYSTICISM._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF MYSTICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have already learnt to see in mysticism a principal characteristic\r\nof degeneration. It follows so generally in the train of the latter,\r\nthat there is scarcely a case of degeneration in which it does not\r\nappear. To cite authorities for this is about as unnecessary as to\r\nadduce proof for the fact that in typhus a rise in the temperature\r\nof the body is invariably observed. I will therefore only repeat one\r\nremark of Legrain’s:[64] ‘Mystical thoughts are to be laid to the\r\naccount of the insanity of the degenerate. There are two states in\r\nwhich they are observed--in epilepsy and in hysterical delirium.’ When\r\nFederoff,[65] who makes mention of religious delirium and ecstasy as\r\namong the accompanying features of an attack of hysteria, puts them\r\ndown as a peculiarity of women, he commits an error, since they are at\r\nleast as common in male hysterical and degenerate subjects as in female.\r\n\r\nWhat is really to be understood by this somewhat vague term\r\n‘mysticism’? The word describes a state of mind in which the subject\r\nimagines that he perceives or divines unknown and inexplicable\r\nrelations amongst phenomena, discerns in things hints at mysteries, and\r\nregards them as symbols, by which a dark power seeks to unveil or, at\r\nleast, to indicate all sorts of marvels which he endeavours to guess,\r\nthough generally in vain. This condition of mind is always connected\r\nwith strong emotional excitement, which consciousness conceives to be\r\nthe result of its presentiments, although it is this excitement, on the\r\ncontrary, which is pre-existent, while the presentiments are caused by\r\nit and receive from it their peculiar direction and colour.\r\n\r\nAll phenomena in the world and in life present themselves in a\r\ndifferent light to the mystic from what they do to the sane man. The\r\nsimplest word uttered before the former appears to him an allusion\r\nto something mysteriously occult; in the most commonplace and\r\nnatural movements he sees hidden signs. All things have for him deep\r\nbackgrounds; far-reaching shadows are thrown by them over adjacent\r\ntracts; they send out wide-spreading roots into remote substrata. Every\r\nimage that rises up in his mind points with mysterious silence, though\r\nwith significant look and finger, to other images distinct or shadowy,\r\nand induces him to set up relations between ideas, where other people\r\nrecognise no connection. In consequence of this peculiarity of his\r\nmind, the mystic lives as if surrounded by sinister forms, from behind\r\nwhose masks enigmatic eyes look forth, and whom he contemplates with\r\nconstant terror, since he is never sure of recognising any shapes among\r\nthe disguises which press upon him. ‘Things are not what they seem’\r\nis the characteristic expression frequently heard from the mystic.\r\nIn the history of a ‘degenerate’ in the clinics of Magnan[66] it is\r\nwritten: ‘A child asks drink of him at a public fountain. He finds this\r\nunnatural. The child follows him. This fills him with astonishment.\r\nAnother time he sees a woman sitting on a curb-stone. He asks himself\r\nwhat that could possibly mean.’ In extreme cases this morbid attitude\r\namounts to hallucinations, which, as a rule, affect the hearing; but\r\nit can also influence sight and the other senses. When this is so, the\r\nmystic does not confine himself to conjectures and guesses at mysteries\r\nin and behind phenomena, but hears and sees as real, things which for\r\nthe sane man are non-existent.\r\n\r\nPathological observation of the insane is content to describe this\r\nmental condition, and to determine its occurrence in the hysterical and\r\ndegenerate. That, however, is not the end of the matter. We also want\r\nto know in what manner the degenerate or exhausted brain falls into\r\nmysticism. In order to understand the subject, we must refer to some\r\nsimple facts in the growth of the mind.[67]\r\n\r\nConscious intellection is activity of the gray surface of the brain, a\r\ntissue consisting of countless nerve-cells united by nerve-fibres. In\r\nthis tissue the nerves, both of the external bodily surface and of the\r\ninternal organs, terminate. When one of these nerves is excited (the\r\nnerve of vision by a ray of light, a nerve in the skin by contact, an\r\norganic nerve by internal chemical action, etc.), it at once conveys\r\nthe excitement to the nerve-cell in the cerebral cortex in which it\r\ndebouches. This cell undergoes in consequence chemical changes, which,\r\nin a healthy condition of the organism, are in direct relation to the\r\nstrength of the stimulus. The nerve-cell, which is immediately affected\r\nby the stimulus conveyed to it by the conducting nerve, propagates in\r\nits turn the stimulus received to all the neighbouring cells with which\r\nit is connected by fibrous processes. The disturbance spreads itself on\r\nall sides, like a wave-circle that is caused by any object thrown into\r\nwater, and subsides gradually exactly as does the wave--more quickly\r\nor more slowly, with greater or less diffusion, as the stimulus that\r\ncaused it has been stronger or weaker.\r\n\r\nEvery stimulus which reaches a place on the cerebral cortex results\r\nin a rush of blood to that spot,[68] by means of which nutriment\r\nis conveyed to it. The brain-cells decompose these substances, and\r\ntransmute the stored-up energy in them into other forms of energy,\r\nnamely, into ideas and motor impulses.[69] How an idea is formed out of\r\nthe decomposition of tissues, how a chemical process is metamorphosed\r\ninto consciousness, nobody knows; but the fact that conscious ideas\r\nare connected with the process of decomposition of tissues in the\r\nstimulated brain-cells is not a matter of doubt.[70]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fundamental property in the nerve-cells of\r\nresponding to a stimulus produced by chemical action, they have also\r\nthe capacity of preserving an image of the strength and character of\r\nthis stimulus. To put it popularly, the cell is able to remember its\r\nimpressions. If now a new, although it may be a weaker, disturbance\r\nreach this cell, it rouses in it an image of similar stimuli which\r\nhad previously reached it, and this memory-image strengthens the\r\nnew stimulus, making it more distinct and more intelligible to\r\nconsciousness. If the cell could not remember, consciousness would\r\nbe ever incapable of interpreting its impressions, and could never\r\nsucceed in attaining to a presentation of the outer world. Particular\r\ndirect stimuli would certainly be perceived, but they would remain\r\nwithout connection or import, since they are by themselves, and without\r\nthe assistance of earlier impressions, inadequate to lead to knowledge.\r\nMemory is therefore the first condition of normal brain activity.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus which reaches a brain-cell gives rise, as we have\r\nseen, to an expansion of this stimulus to the neighbouring cells,\r\nto a wave of stimulus proceeding in all directions. And since every\r\nstimulus is connected with the rise of conscious presentations, it\r\nproves that every stimulus calls a large number of presentations into\r\nconsciousness, and not only such presentations as are related to the\r\nimmediate external cause of the stimulation perceived, but also such\r\nas are only aroused by the cells that elaborate them happening to lie\r\nin the vicinity of that cell, or group of cells, which the external\r\nstimulus has immediately reached. The wave of stimulus, like every\r\nother wave-motion, is strongest at its inception; it subsides in\r\ndirect ratio to the widening of its circle, till at last it vanishes\r\ninto the imperceptible. Corresponding to this, the presentations,\r\nhaving their seat in cells which are in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthose first reached by the stimulus, are the most lively, while those\r\narising from the more distant cells are somewhat less distinct, and\r\nthis distinctness continues to decrease until consciousness can no\r\nlonger perceive them--until they, as science expresses it, sink beneath\r\nthe threshold of consciousness. Each particular stimulus arouses,\r\ntherefore, not only in the cell to which it was directly led, but also\r\nin countless other contiguous and connected cells, the activity which\r\nis bound up with presentation. Thus arise simultaneously, or, more\r\naccurately, following each other in an immeasurably short interval of\r\ntime, thousands of impressions of regularly decreasing distinctness;\r\nand since unnumbered thousands of external and internal organic stimuli\r\nare carried to the brain, so continually thousands of stimulus-waves\r\nare coursing through it, crossing and intersecting each other with the\r\ngreatest diversity, and in their course arousing millions of emerging,\r\nwaning, and vanishing impressions. It is this that Goethe means when he\r\ndepicts in such splendid language how\r\n\r\n  ‘...ein Tritt tausend Fäden regt,\r\n  Die Schifflein herüber, hinüber schiessen,\r\n  Die Fäden ungesehen fliessen,\r\n  Ein Schlag tausend Verbindungen schlägt.’[71]\r\n\r\nNow, memory is a property not only of the nerve-cell, but also of the\r\nnerve-fibre, which is only a modification of the cell. The fibre has\r\na recollection of the stimulus which it conveyed, in the same way as\r\nthe cell has of that which it has transformed into presentation and\r\nmotion. A stimulus will be more easily conducted by a fibre which has\r\nalready conveyed it, than by one which propagates it for the first time\r\nfrom one cell to another. Every stimulus which reaches a cell will take\r\nthe line of least resistance, and this will be set out for it along\r\nthose nerve-tracks which it has already traversed. Thus a definite\r\npath is formed for the course of a stimulus-wave, a customary line\r\nof march; it is always the same nerve-cells which exchange mutually\r\ntheir stimulus-waves. Presentation always awakens the same resulting\r\npresentations, and always appears in consciousness accompanied by them.\r\nThis procedure is called the association of ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is neither volition nor accident that determines to which other\r\ncells a disturbed cell habitually communicates its stimulus, which\r\naccompanying impressions an aroused presentation draws with it into\r\nconsciousness. On the contrary, the linking of presentations is\r\ndependent upon laws which Wundt especially has well formulated.\r\n\r\nThose who have not been born blind and deaf (like the unfortunate\r\nLaura Bridgman, cited by all psychologists) will never be influenced\r\nby one external stimulus only, but invariably by many stimuli at once.\r\nEvery single phenomenon of the outer world has, as a rule, not only\r\none quality, but many; and since that which we call a quality is the\r\nassumed cause of a definite sensation, it results that phenomena appeal\r\nat once to several senses, are simultaneously seen, heard, felt, and\r\nmoreover are seen in different degrees of light and colour, heard in\r\nvarious nuances of timbre, etc. The few phenomena which possess only\r\none quality and arouse therefore only one sense, _e.g._, thunder, which\r\nis only heard, although with varying intensity, occur nevertheless in\r\nconjunction with other phenomena, such as, to keep to thunder, with a\r\nclouded sky, lightning and rain. Our brains are therefore accustomed to\r\nreceive at once from every phenomenon several stimuli, which proceed\r\npartly from the many qualities of the phenomenon itself, and partly\r\nfrom the phenomena usually accompanying it. Now, it is sufficient that\r\nonly one of these stimuli should reach the brain, in order to call\r\ninto life, in virtue of the habitual association of the memory-images,\r\nthe remaining stimuli of the same group as well. Simultaneity of\r\nimpressions is therefore a cause of the association of ideas.\r\n\r\nOne and the same quality belongs to many phenomena. There is a whole\r\nseries of things which are blue, round, and smooth. The possession\r\nof a common quality is a condition of similarity, which is greater in\r\nproportion to the number of common qualities. Every single quality,\r\nhowever, belongs to a habitually associated group of qualities, and can\r\nby the mechanism of simultaneity arouse the memory-image of this group.\r\nIn consequence of their similarity, therefore, the memory-images can be\r\naroused of all those groups, which resemble each other in some quality.\r\nThe colour blue is a quality which belongs equally to the cheerful sky,\r\nthe cornflower, the sea, certain eyes, and many military uniforms. The\r\nperception of blue will awaken the memory of some or many blue things\r\nwhich are only related through their common colour. Similarity is\r\ntherefore another cause of the association of ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is a distinctive characteristic of the brain-cell to elaborate at\r\nthe same time both a presentation and its opposite. It is probable that\r\nwhat we perceive as its opposite is generally, in its original and\r\nsimplest form, only the consciousness of the cessation of a certain\r\npresentation. As the fatigue of the optic nerve by a colour arouses\r\nthe sensation of the complimentary colour, so, on the exhaustion\r\nof a brain-cell through the elaboration of a presentation, the\r\ncontrary presentation appears in consciousness. Now, whether this\r\ninterpretation be right or not, the fact itself is established through\r\nthe ‘contradictory double meaning of primitive roots,’ discovered by K.\r\nAbel.[72] Contrast is the third cause of the association of ideas.\r\n\r\nMany phenomena present themselves in the same place close to, or after,\r\none another; and we associate there, presentation of the particular\r\nplace with those objects, to which it is used to serve as a frame.\r\nSimultaneity, similarity, contrast, and occurrence in the same place\r\n(contiguity), are thus, according to Wundt, the four conditions under\r\nwhich phenomena will be connected in our consciousness through the\r\nassociation of ideas. To these James Sully[73] believes yet a fifth\r\nshould be added: presentations which are rooted in the same emotion.\r\nNevertheless all the examples cited by the distinguished English\r\npsychologist demonstrate without effort the action of one or more of\r\nWundt’s laws.\r\n\r\nIn order that an organism should maintain itself, it must be in a\r\nposition to make use of natural resources, and protect itself from\r\nadverse conditions of every sort. It can accomplish this only if\r\nit possesses a knowledge of these adverse conditions, and of such\r\nnatural resources as it can use; and it can do this better and more\r\nsurely the more complete this knowledge is. In the more highly\r\ndifferentiated organism it devolves upon the brain and nervous system\r\nto acquire knowledge of the outer world, and to turn that knowledge\r\nto the advantage of the organism. Memory makes it possible for the\r\nbrain to perform its task, and the mechanism by which memory is\r\nmade to serve the purport of knowledge is the association of ideas.\r\nFor it is clear that a brain, in which a single perception awakens\r\nthrough the operation of the association of ideas a whole train of\r\nconnected representations, will recognise, conceive and judge far more\r\nrapidly than one in which no association of ideas obtains, and which\r\ntherefore would form only such concepts as had for their content direct\r\nsense-perceptions and such representations as originated in those cells\r\nwhich, by the accident of their contiguity, happened to lie in the\r\ncircuit of a stimulus-wave. For the brain which works with association\r\nof ideas, the perception of a ray of light, of a tone, is sufficient,\r\nin order instantly to produce the presentation of the object from\r\nwhich the sensation proceeds, as well as of its relations in time\r\nand space, to group these presentations as concepts, and from these\r\nconcepts to arrive at a judgment. To the brain without association of\r\nideas that perception would only convey the presentation of having\r\nsomething bright or sonant in front of it. In addition, presentations\r\nwould be aroused which had nothing in common with this bright or sonant\r\nsomething; it could form no image of the exciter of the sense, but it\r\nwould first have to receive a train of further impressions from several\r\nor all of the senses, in order to learn to recognise the various\r\nproperties of the object, of which at first only a tone or a colour\r\nwas perceived, and to unite them in a single presentation. Even then\r\nthe brain would only know in what the object consisted, _i.e._, what\r\nit had in front of it, but not how the object stood in relation to\r\nother things, where and when it had already been perceived, and by what\r\nphenomena it was accompanied, etc. Knowledge of objects thus acquired\r\nwould be wholly unadapted to the formation of a right judgment. It\r\ncan now be seen what a great advantage was given to the organism in\r\nthe struggle for existence by the association of ideas, and what\r\nimmense progress in the development of the brain and its activity the\r\nacquirement of it signified.\r\n\r\nBut this is only true with a limitation. The association of ideas as\r\nsuch does not do more to lighten the task of the brain in apprehending\r\nand in judging than does the uprising throng of memory-images in the\r\nneighbourhood of the excited centre. The presentations, which the\r\nassociation of ideas calls into consciousness, stand, it is true,\r\nin somewhat closer connection with the phenomenon which has sent a\r\nstimulus to the brain, and by the latter has been perceived, than do\r\nthose occurring in the geometrical circuit of the stimulus-wave;\r\nbut even this connection is so slight, that it offers no efficient\r\nhelp in the interpretation of the phenomenon. We must not forget that\r\nproperly all our perceptions, ideas, and conceptions are connected more\r\nor less closely through the association of ideas. As in the example\r\ncited above the sensation of blue arouses the ideas of the sky, the\r\nsea, a blue eye, a uniform, etc., so will each of these ideas arouse\r\nin its turn, according to Wundt’s law, ideas associated with them.\r\nThe sky will arouse the idea of stars, clouds and rain; the sea, that\r\nof ships, voyages, foreign lands, fishes, pearls, etc.; blue eyes,\r\nthat of a girl’s face, of love and all its emotions; in short, this\r\none sensation, through the mechanism of the association of ideas, can\r\narouse pretty well almost all the conceptions which we have ever at any\r\ntime formed, and the blue object which we have in fact before our eyes\r\nand perceive, will, through this crowd of ideas which are not directly\r\nrelated to it, be neither interpreted nor explained.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that the association of ideas may fulfil its\r\nfunctions in the operations of the brain, and prove itself a\r\nuseful acquisition to the organism, one thing more must be added,\r\nnamely, attention. This it is which brings order into the chaos of\r\nrepresentations awakened by the association of ideas, and makes them\r\nsubserve the purposes of cognition and judgment.\r\n\r\nWhat is attention? Th. Ribot[74] defines this attribute as ‘a\r\nspontaneous or an artificial adaptation of the individual to a\r\npredominating thought’. (I translate this definition freely because\r\ntoo long an explanation would be necessary to make the uninitiated\r\ncomprehend the expressions made use of by Ribot.) In other words,\r\nattention is the faculty of the brain to suppress one part of the\r\nmemory-images which, at each excitation of a cell or group of cells,\r\nhave arisen in consciousness, by way either of association or of\r\nstimulus-wave; and to maintain another part, namely, only those\r\nmemory-images which relate to the exciting cause, _i.e._, to the object\r\njust perceived.\r\n\r\nWho makes this selection among the memory-images? The stimulus itself,\r\nwhich rouses the brain-cells into activity. Naturally those cells\r\nwould be the most strongly excited which are directly connected with\r\nthe afferent nerves. Somewhat weaker is the excitement of the cells to\r\nwhich the cell first excited sends its impulse by way of the customary\r\nnerve channels; still weaker the excitement of those cells which,\r\nby the same mechanism, receive their stimulus from the secondarily\r\nexcited cell. That idea will be the most powerful, therefore, which\r\nis awakened directly by the perception itself; somewhat weaker that\r\nwhich is aroused by the first impression through association of ideas;\r\nweaker still that which the association in its turn involves. We\r\nknow further that a phenomenon never produces a single stimulus, but\r\nseveral at once. If, for example, we see a man before us, we do not\r\nmerely perceive a single point in him, but a larger or smaller portion\r\nof his exterior, _i.e._, a large number of differently coloured and\r\ndifferently illuminated points; perhaps we hear him as well, possibly\r\ntouch him, and, at all events, perceive besides him somewhat of his\r\nenvironment, of his spacial relations. Thus, there arise in our brain\r\nquite a number of centres of stimulation, operating simultaneously in\r\nthe manner described above. There awakes in consciousness a series\r\nof primary presentations, which are stronger, _i.e._, clearer, than\r\nthe associated or consequent representations, namely, just those\r\npresentations which the man standing before us has himself aroused.\r\nThey are like the brightest light-spots in the midst of others less\r\nbrilliant. These brightest light-spots necessarily predominate in\r\nconsciousness over the lesser ones. They fill the consciousness,\r\nwhich combines them in a judgment. For what we call a judgment is,\r\nin the last resort, nothing else than a simultaneous lighting up of\r\na number of presentations in consciousness, which we in truth only\r\nbring into relation with each other because we ourselves became\r\nconscious of them at one and the same moment. The ascendency which\r\nthe clearer presentations acquire over the more obscure, the primary\r\npresentations over derived representations, in consciousness, enables\r\nthem, with the help of the will, to influence for a time the whole\r\nbrain-activity to their own advantage, viz., to suppress the weaker,\r\n_i.e._, the derived, representations; to combat those which cannot be\r\nmade to agree with them; to reinforce, to draw into their circuit of\r\nstimulation, or simply to arouse, others, through which they themselves\r\nare reinforced and secure some duration in the midst of the constant\r\nemergence and disappearance of representations in their pursuit of each\r\nother. I myself conceive the interference of the will in this struggle\r\nfor life amongst representations as giving motor impulses (even if\r\nunconsciously) to the muscles of the cerebral arteries. By this means\r\nthe bloodvessels are dilated or contracted as required,[75] and the\r\nconsequent supply of blood becomes more or less copious.[76] The cells\r\nwhich receive no blood must suspend their action; those which receive a\r\nlarger supply can, on the contrary, operate more powerfully. The will\r\nwhich regulates the distribution of blood, when incited by a group of\r\npresentations temporarily predominating, thus resembles a servant who\r\nis constantly occupied in a room in carrying out the behests of his\r\nmaster: to light the gas in one place, in another to turn it up higher,\r\nin another to turn it off partly or wholly, so that at one moment this,\r\nand at another that, corner of the room becomes bright, dim, or dark.\r\nThe preponderance of a group of presentations allows them during their\r\nperiod of power to bring into their service, not only the brain-cells,\r\nbut the whole organism besides; and not only to fortify themselves\r\nthrough the representations which they arouse by way of association,\r\nbut also to seek certain new sense-impressions, and repress others, in\r\norder, on the one hand, to obtain new excitations favourable to their\r\npersistence--new original perceptions--and on the other hand, through\r\nthe exclusion of the rest, to ward off such excitations as are adverse\r\nto their persistence.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I see in the street a passer-by who for some reason\r\narouses my attention. The attention immediately suppresses all other\r\npresentations which, an instant before, were in my consciousness, and\r\npermits those only to remain which refer to the passer-by. In order to\r\nintensify these presentations I look after him, _i.e._, the ciliary and\r\nocular muscles, then the muscles of the neck, perhaps also the muscles\r\nof the body and of the legs, receive motor impulses, which serve the\r\npurpose only of keeping up continually new sense-impressions of the\r\nobject of my attention, by means of which the presentations of him are\r\ncontinuously strengthened and multiplied. I do not notice other persons\r\nwho for the time come into my field of vision, I disregard the sounds\r\nwhich meet my ears, if my attention is strong enough I do not perhaps\r\neven hear them; but I should at once hear them if they proceeded from\r\nthe particular passer-by, or if they had any reference to him.\r\n\r\nThis is the ‘adaptation of the whole organism to a predominant idea’\r\nof which Ribot speaks. This it is which gives us exact knowledge of\r\nthe external world. Without it that knowledge would be much more\r\ndifficult of attainment, and would remain much more incomplete. This\r\nadaptation will continue until the cells, which are the bearers of\r\nthe predominating presentations, become fatigued. They will then be\r\ncompelled to surrender their supremacy to other groups of cells,\r\nwhereupon the latter will obtain the power to adapt the organism to\r\ntheir purposes.\r\n\r\nThus we see it is only through attention that the faculty of\r\nassociation becomes a property advantageous to the organism, and\r\nattention is nothing but the faculty of the will to determine\r\nthe emergence, degree of clearness, duration and extinction of\r\npresentations in consciousness. The stronger the will, so much the more\r\ncompletely can we adapt the whole organism to a given presentation, so\r\nmuch the more can we obtain sense impressions which serve to enhance\r\nthis presentation, so much the more can we by association induce\r\nmemory-images, which complete and rectify the presentation, so much the\r\nmore definitely can we suppress the presentations which disturb it or\r\nare foreign to it; in a word, so much the more exhaustive and correct\r\nwill our knowledge be of phenomena and their true connection.\r\n\r\nCulture and command over the powers of nature are solely the result of\r\nattention; all errors, all superstition, the consequence of defective\r\nattention. False ideas of the connection between phenomena arise\r\nthrough defective observation of them, and will be rectified by a more\r\nexact observation. Now, to observe means nothing else than to convey\r\ndeliberately determined sense-impressions to the brain, and thereby\r\nraise a group of presentations to such clearness and intensity that it\r\ncan acquire preponderance in consciousness, arouse through association\r\nits allied memory-images, and suppress such as are incompatible with\r\nitself. Observation, which lies at the root of all progress, is thus\r\nthe adaptation through attention of the sense-organs and their centres\r\nof perception to a presentation or group of presentations predominating\r\nin consciousness.\r\n\r\nA state of attention allows no obscurity to persist in consciousness.\r\nFor either the will strengthens every rising presentation to full\r\nclearness and distinctness, or, if it cannot do this, it extinguishes\r\nthe idea completely. The consciousness of a healthy, strong-minded, and\r\nconsequently attentive man, resembles a room in the full light of day,\r\nin which the eye sees all objects distinctly, in which all outlines are\r\nsharp, and wherein no indefinite shadows are floating.\r\n\r\nAttention, therefore, presupposes strength of will, and this, again,\r\nis the property only of a normally constituted and unexhausted brain.\r\nIn the degenerate, whose brain and nervous system are characterized\r\nby hereditary malformations or irregularities; in the hysterical,\r\nwhom we have learnt to regard as victims of exhaustion, the will is\r\nentirely lacking, is possessed only in a small degree. The consequence\r\nof weakness or want of will is incapacity of attention. Alexander\r\nStarr[77] published twenty-three cases of lesions, or diseases of\r\nthe convolutions of the brain, in which ‘it was impossible for the\r\npatients to fix their attention’; and Ribot[78] remarks: ‘A man who\r\nis tired after a long walk, a convalescent who has undergone a severe\r\nillness--in a word, all weakened persons are incapable of attention....\r\nInability to be attentive accompanies all forms of exhaustion.’\r\n\r\nUntended and unrestrained by attention, the brain activity of the\r\ndegenerate and hysterical is capricious, and without aim or purpose.\r\nThrough the unrestricted play of association representations are called\r\ninto consciousness, and are free to run riot there. They are aroused\r\nand extinguished automatically; and the will does not interfere to\r\nstrengthen or to suppress them. Representations mutually alien or\r\nmutually exclusive appear continuously. The fact that they are retained\r\nin consciousness simultaneously, and at about the same intensity,\r\ncombines them (in conformity with the laws of conscious activity) into\r\na thought which is necessarily absurd, and cannot express the true\r\nrelations of phenomena.\r\n\r\nWeakness or want of attention, produces, then, in the first place,\r\nfalse judgments respecting the objective universe, respecting the\r\nqualities of things and their relations to each other. Consciousness\r\nacquires a distorted and blurred view of the external world. And there\r\nfollows a further consequence. The chaotic course of stimuli along\r\nthe channels of association and of the adjacent structures arouses\r\nthe activity both of contiguous, of further, and of furthest removed\r\ngroups of cells, which, left to themselves, act only so long and with\r\nsuch varying intensity as is proportionate to the intensity of the\r\nstimulus which has reached them. Clear, obscure, and yet obscurer\r\nrepresentations rise in consciousness, which, after a time, disappear\r\nagain, without having attained to greater distinctness than they had\r\nwhen first appearing. The clear representations produce a thought, but\r\nsuch a one as cannot for a moment become firmer or clearer, because\r\nthe definite representations of which it is composed are mingled\r\nwith others which consciousness perceives indistinctly, or scarcely\r\nperceives at all. Such obscure ideas cross the threshold of even a\r\nhealthy person’s consciousness; but in that case attention intervenes\r\nat once, to bring them fully to the light, or entirely to suppress\r\nthem. These synchronous overtones of every thought cannot, therefore,\r\nblur the tonic note. The emergent thought-phantoms can acquire no\r\ninfluence over the thought-procedure because attention either lightens\r\nup their faces, or banishes them back to their under-world of the\r\nUnconscious. It is otherwise with the degenerate and debilitated,\r\nwho suffer from weakness of will and defective attention. The faint,\r\nscarcely recognisable, liminal presentations are perceived at the same\r\ntime as those that are well lit and centrally focussed. The judgment\r\ngrows drifting and nebulous like floating fog in the morning wind.\r\nConsciousness, aware of the spectrally transparent shapes, seeks in\r\nvain to grasp them, and interprets them without confidence, as when\r\none fancies in a cloud resemblances to creatures or things. Whoever\r\nhas sought on a dark night to discern phenomena on a distant horizon\r\ncan form an idea of the picture which the world of thought presents to\r\nthe mind of an asthenic. Lo there! a dark mass! What is it? A tree?\r\nA hayrick? A robber? A beast of prey? Ought one to fly? Ought one\r\nto attack it? The incapacity to recognise the object, more guessed\r\nat than perceived, fills him with uneasiness and anxiety. This is\r\njust the condition of the mind of an asthenic in the presence of his\r\nliminal presentations. He believes he sees in them a hundred things\r\nat once, and he brings all the forms that he seems to discern into\r\nconnection with the principal presentation which has aroused them. He\r\nhas, however, a strong feeling that this connection is incomprehensible\r\nand inexplicable. He combines presentations into a thought which\r\nis in contradiction to all experience, but which he must look upon\r\nas equal in validity to all his remaining thoughts and opinions,\r\nbecause it originated in the same way. And even if he wishes to make\r\nclear to himself what is really the content of his judgment, and of\r\nwhat particular presentations it is composed, he observes that these\r\npresentations are, as a matter of fact, nothing but unrecognisable\r\nadumbrations of presentations, to which he vainly seeks to give a\r\nname. Now, this state of mind, in which a man is straining to see,\r\nthinks he sees, but does not see--in which a man is forced to construct\r\nthoughts out of presentations which befool and mock consciousness\r\nlike will-o’-the-wisps or marsh vapours--in which a man fancies that\r\nhe perceives inexplicable relations between distinct phenomena and\r\nambiguous formless shadows--this is the condition of mind that is\r\ncalled Mysticism.\r\n\r\nFrom the shadowy thinking of the mystic, springs his washed-out style\r\nof expression. Every word, even the most abstract, connotes a concrete\r\npresentation or a concept, which, inasmuch as it is formed out of the\r\ncommon attributes of different concrete presentations, betrays its\r\nconcrete origin. Language has no word for that which one believes he\r\nsees as through a mist, without recognisable form. The mystic, however,\r\nis conscious of ghostly presentations of this sort without shape or\r\nother qualities, and in order to express them he must either use\r\nrecognised words, to which he gives a meaning wholly different from\r\nthat which is generally current, or else, feeling the inadequacy of the\r\nfund of language created by those of sound mind, he forges for himself\r\nspecial words which, to a stranger, are generally incomprehensible,\r\nand the cloudy, chaotic sense of which is intelligible only to\r\nhimself; or, finally, he embodies the several meanings which he gives\r\nto his shapeless representations in as many words, and then succeeds\r\nin achieving those bewildering juxtapositions of what is mutually\r\nexclusive, those expressions which can in no way be rationally made\r\nto harmonize, but which are so typical of the mystic. He speaks, as\r\ndid the German mystics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nof the ‘cold fire’ of hell, and of the ‘dark light’ of Satan; or,\r\nhe says, like the degenerate in the twenty-eighth pathological case\r\nof Legrain,[79] ‘that God appeared to him in the form of luminous\r\nshadows;’ or he remarks, as did another of Legrain’s patients:[80] ‘You\r\nhave given me an immutable evening’ (_soirée immutable_).[81]\r\n\r\nThe healthy reader or listener who has confidence in his own judgment,\r\nand tests with lucidity and self-dependence, naturally discerns at\r\nonce that these mystical expressions are senseless, and do but reflect\r\nthe mystic’s confused manner of thinking. The majority of mankind,\r\nhowever, have neither self-confidence nor the faculty of judging,\r\nand cannot throw off the natural inclination to connect some meaning\r\nwith every word. And since the words of the mystic have no definite\r\nmeaning in themselves, or in their juxtaposition, a certain meaning\r\nis arbitrarily imputed to them, is mysteriously conjured into them.\r\nThe effect of the mystical method of expression on people who allow\r\nthemselves to be bewildered is for this reason a very strong one. It\r\ngives them food for thought, as they call it; that is to say, it allows\r\nthem to give way to all kinds of dream-fancies, which is very much\r\neasier, and therefore more agreeable, than the toil of reflecting on\r\nfirmly outlined presentations and thoughts admitting of no evasions\r\nand extravagances.[82] It transports their minds to the same condition\r\nof mental activity determined by unbridled association of ideas that\r\nis peculiar to the mystic; it awakens in them also his ambiguous,\r\nunutterable presentations, and makes them divine the strangest and\r\nmost impossible relations of things to each other. All the weak-headed\r\nappear therefore ‘deep’ to the mystic, and this designation has, from\r\nthe constant use made of it by them, become almost an insult. Only\r\nvery strong minds are really deep, such as can keep the processes of\r\nthought under the discipline of an extraordinarily powerful attention.\r\nSuch minds are in a position to exploit the association of ideas in the\r\nbest possible way, to impart the greatest sharpness and clearness to\r\nall representations which through them are called into consciousness;\r\nto suppress them firmly and rapidly if they are not compatible with\r\nthe rest; to procure new sense-impressions, if these are necessary in\r\norder to make the presentations and judgments predominant at the time\r\nin their minds still more vivid and distinct; they gain in this way an\r\nincomparably clear picture of the world, and discover true relations\r\namong phenomena which, to a weaker attention, must always remain\r\nhidden. This true depth of strong select minds is wholly luminous. It\r\nscares shadows out of hidden corners, and fills abysses with radiant\r\nlight. The mystic’s pseudo-depth, on the contrary, is all obscurity.\r\nIt causes things to appear deep by the same means as darkness, viz.,\r\nby reason of its rendering their outlines imperceptible. The mystic\r\nobliterates the firm outlines of phenomena; he spreads a veil over\r\nthem, and conceals them in blue vapour. He troubles what is clear, and\r\nmakes the transparent opaque, as does the cuttle-fish the waters of the\r\nocean. He, therefore, who sees the world through the eyes of a mystic,\r\ngazes into a black heaving mass, in which he can always find what he\r\ndesires, although, and just because, he actually perceives nothing at\r\nall. To the weak-headed everything which is clearly, firmly defined,\r\nand which, therefore, has strictly but one meaning, is flat. To them\r\neverything is profound which has no meaning, and which, therefore,\r\nallows them to apply what meaning they please. To them mathematical\r\nanalysis is flat; theology and metaphysics, deep. The study of Roman\r\nlaw is flat; the dream-book and the prophecies of Nostradamus are deep.\r\nThe forms assumed by pouring molten lead on New Year’s Eve are the true\r\nsymbols of their depth.\r\n\r\nThe content of mystic thought is determined by the individual character\r\nand level of culture possessed by each degenerate and hysteric. For\r\nwe should never forget that the morbidly-affected or exhausted brain\r\nis only the soil which receives the seed sown by nurture, education,\r\nimpressions and experience of life, etc. The seed-grains do not\r\noriginate in the soil; they only receive in and through it their\r\nspecial irregularities of development, their deformities, and crazy\r\noffshoots. The naturalist who loses the faculty of attention becomes\r\nthe so-called ‘Natural Philosopher,’ or the discoverer of a fourth\r\ndimension in space, like the unfortunate Zöllner. A rough, ignorant\r\nperson from the low ranks of the people falls into the wildest\r\nsuperstition. The mystic, nurtured in religion and nourished with\r\ndogma, refers his shadowy impressions to his beliefs, and interprets\r\nthem as revelations of the nature of the Trinity, or of the condition\r\nof existence before birth or after death. The technologist who has\r\nfallen into mysticism worries over impossible inventions, believes\r\nhimself to be on the track of the solution of the problem of a\r\n_perpetuum mobile_, devises communication between earth and stars,\r\nshafts to the glowing core of the earth, and what not. The astronomer\r\nbecomes an astrologist, the chemist an alchemist and a seeker after the\r\nphilosopher’s stone; the mathematician labours to square the circle, or\r\nto invent a system in which the notion of progress is expressed by a\r\nprocess of integration, the war of 1870 by an equation, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs was set forth above, the cerebral cortex receives its stimuli,\r\nnot only from the external nerves, but also from the interior of the\r\norganism, from the nerves of separate organs, and the nerve-centres of\r\nthe spinal cord and the sympathetic system. Every excitement in these\r\ncentres affects the brain-cells, and arouses in them more or less\r\ndistinct presentations, which are necessarily related to the activity\r\nof the centres from which the stimulus proceeds. A few examples will\r\nmake this clear, even to the uninitiated. If the organism feels the\r\nneed of nourishment, and we are hungry, we shall not only be generally\r\nconscious of an indeterminate desire for food, but there will also\r\narise in our minds definite representations of dishes, of served\r\nrepasts, and of all the accessories of eating. If we, from some cause,\r\nmaybe an affection of the heart or lungs, cannot breathe freely, we\r\nhave not only a hunger for air, but also accompanying ideas of an\r\nuneasy nature, presentiments of unknown dangers, melancholy memories,\r\netc., _i.e._, representations of circumstances which tend to deprive\r\nus of breath or affect us oppressively. During sleep also organic\r\nstimuli exert this influence on the cerebral cortex, and to them we owe\r\nthe so-called somatic dreams (_Leibesträume_), _i.e._, dream-images\r\nabout the functioning of any organs which happen not to be in a normal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nNow, it is known that certain organic nerve-centres, the sexual\r\ncentres, namely, in the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata, are\r\nfrequently malformed, or morbidly irritated among the degenerate.\r\nThe stimuli proceeding from them therefore awaken, in the brain of\r\npatients of this sort, presentations which are more or less remotely\r\nconnected with the sexual activity. In the consciousness, therefore,\r\nof such a subject there always exist, among the other presentations\r\nwhich are aroused by the varying stimuli of the external world,\r\npresentations of a sexual character, erotic thoughts being associated\r\nwith every impression of beings and things. In this way he attains to\r\na state of mind in which he divines mysterious relations among all\r\npossible objective phenomena, _e.g._, a railway-train, the title of his\r\nnewspaper, a piano on the one hand, and woman on the other; and feels\r\nemotions of an erotic nature at sights, words, odours, which would\r\nproduce no such impression on the mind of a sound person, emotions\r\nwhich he refers to unknown qualities in those sights, words, etc. Hence\r\nit comes that in most cases mysticism distinctly takes on a decidedly\r\nerotic colouring, and the mystic, if he interprets his inchoate liminal\r\npresentations, always tends to ascribe to them an erotic import. The\r\nmixture of super-sensuousness and sensuality, of religious and amorous\r\nrapture, which characterizes mystic thought, has been noticed even by\r\nthose observers who do not understand in what way it is brought about.\r\n\r\nThe mysticism which I have hitherto investigated is the incapacity,\r\ndue to weakness of will, either innate or acquired, to guide the work\r\nof the association of ideas by attention, to draw shadowy liminal\r\nrepresentations into the bright focal circle of consciousness, and to\r\nsuppress presentations which are incompatible with those attended to.\r\nThere exists, however, another form of mysticism, the cause of which\r\nis not defective attention, but an anomaly in the sensitivity of the\r\nbrain and nervous system. In the healthy organism the afferent nerves\r\nconvey impressions of the external world in their full freshness to the\r\nbrain, and the stimulation of the brain-cell is in direct ratio to the\r\nintensity of the stimulus conducted to it. Not so is the deportment of\r\na degenerate or exhausted organism. Here the brain may have forfeited\r\nits normal irritability; it is blunted, and is only feebly excited\r\nby stimuli conveyed to it. Such a brain, as a rule, never succeeds\r\nin elaborating sharply-defined impressions. Its thoughts are always\r\nshadowy and confounded. There is, however, no occasion for me to depict\r\nin detail the characteristics of its mental procedure, for in the\r\nhigher species of the degenerate a blunted brain is hardly ever met\r\nwith, and plays no part in art or literature. To the possessor of a\r\nsluggishly-reacting brain it hardly ever occurs to compose or paint.\r\nHe is of account only as forming the creative mystic’s partial and\r\ngrateful public. Inadequate excitability may moreover be a property\r\nof the sensory nerves. This irregularity leads to anomalies in mental\r\nlife, with which I shall deal exhaustively in the next book. Finally,\r\ninstead of slow reaction there may exist excessive excitability, and\r\nthis may be peculiar to the whole nervous system and brain, or only to\r\na portion of the latter. A generally excessive excitability produces\r\nthose morbidly-sensitive natures in whom the most insignificant\r\nphenomena create the most astonishing perceptions; who hear the\r\n‘sobbing of the evening glow,’ shudder at the contact of a flower;\r\ndistinguish thrilling prophecies and fearful threatenings in the\r\nsighing of the wind, etc.[83] Excessive irritability of particular\r\ngroups of cells of the cerebral cortex gives rise to other phenomena.\r\nIn the affected part of the brain, stimulated either externally or\r\nby adjacent stimuli, in other words, by sense impressions or by\r\nassociation, the disturbance does not in this case proceed in a natural\r\nratio to the strength of the exciting cause, but is stronger and more\r\nlasting than is warranted by the stimulus. The aroused group of cells\r\nreturns to a state of rest either with difficulty or not at all. It\r\nattracts large quantities of nutriment for purposes of absorption,\r\nwithdrawing them from the other parts of the brain. It works like a\r\nmachine which an unskilful hand has set in motion but cannot stop.\r\nIf the normal action of the brain-cells may be compared to quiet\r\ncombustion, the action of a morbidly-irritable group of cells may be\r\nsaid to resemble an explosion, and one, too, which is both violent and\r\npersistent. With the stimulus there flames forth in consciousness a\r\npresentation, or train of presentations, conceptions and reasonings,\r\nwhich suffuse the mind as with the glare of a conflagration, outshining\r\nall other ideas.\r\n\r\nThe degree of exclusiveness and insistence in the predominance of any\r\npresentation is in proportion to the degree of morbid irritability in\r\nthe particular tract of brain by which it is elaborated. Where the\r\ndegree is not excessive there arise obsessions which the consciousness\r\nrecognises as morbid. They do not preclude the coexistence of healthy\r\nfunctioning of the brain, and consciousness acquires the habit of\r\ntreating these co-existent obsessions as foreign to itself, and of\r\nbanishing them from its presentations and judgments. In aggravated\r\ncases these obsessions grow into fixed ideas. The immoderately\r\nexcitable portions of the brain work out their ideas with such\r\nliveliness that consciousness is filled with them, and can no longer\r\ndistinguish them from such as are the result of sense-impressions, the\r\nnature and strength of which they accurately reflect. Then we reach\r\nthe stage of hallucinations and delirium. Finally, in the last stage,\r\ncomes ecstasy, which Ribot calls ‘the acute form of the effort after\r\nunity of consciousness.’ In ecstasy the excited part of the brain\r\nworks with such violence that it suppresses the functioning of all\r\nthe rest of the brain. The ecstatic subject is completely insensible\r\nto external stimuli. There is no perception, no representation, no\r\ngrouping of presentations into concepts, and of concepts into judgments\r\nand reasoning. A single presentation, or group of presentations, fills\r\nup consciousness. These presentations are of extreme distinctness and\r\nclearness. Consciousness is, as it were, flooded with the blinding\r\nlight of mid-day. There therefore takes place exactly the reverse\r\nof what has been noticed in the case of the ordinary mystic. The\r\necstatic state is associated with extremely intense emotions, in\r\nwhich the highest bliss is mixed with pain. These emotions accompany\r\nevery strong and excessive functioning of the nerve-cells, every\r\nextraordinary and violent decomposition of nerve-nutriment. The\r\nfeeling of voluptuousness is an example of the phenomena accompanying\r\nextraordinary decompositions in a nerve-cell. In healthy persons the\r\nsexual nerve-centres are the only ones which, conformably with their\r\nfunctions, are so differentiated and so adapted that they exercise no\r\nuniform or lasting activity, but, for by far the greatest part of the\r\ntime, are perfectly tranquil, storing up large quantities of nutriment\r\nin order, during very short periods, to decompose this suddenly and,\r\nas it were, explosively. Every nerve-centre which operates in this\r\nway would procure us voluptuous emotion; but precisely among healthy\r\npersons there are, except the sexual nerve-centres, none which are\r\ncompelled to act in this manner, in order to serve the purpose of the\r\norganism. Among the degenerate, on the contrary, particular morbidly\r\nexcited brain-centres operate in this way, and the emotions of delight\r\nwhich accompany their explosive activity are more powerful than sexual\r\nfeelings, in proportion as the brain-centres are more sensitive than\r\nthe subordinate and more sluggish spinal centres. One may completely\r\nbelieve the assurances of great ecstatics, such as a St. Theresa,\r\na Mohammed, an Ignatius Loyola, that the bliss accompanying their\r\necstatic visions is unlike anything earthly, and almost more than a\r\nmortal can bear. This latter statement proves that they were conscious\r\nof the sharp pain which accompanies nerve-action in overexcited\r\nbrain-cells, and which, on careful analysis, may be distinguished in\r\nevery very strong feeling of pleasure. The circumstance that the only\r\nnormal organic sensation known to us which resembles that of ecstasy\r\nis the sexual feeling, explains the fact that ecstatics connect their\r\necstatic presentations by way of association with the idea of love,\r\nand describe the ecstasy itself as a kind of supernatural act of\r\nlove, as a union of an ineffably high and pure sort with God or the\r\nBlessed Virgin. This drawing near to God and the saints is the natural\r\nresult of a religious training, which begets the habit of looking\r\non everything inexplicable as supernatural, and of bringing it into\r\nconnection with the doctrines of faith.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that mysticism depends upon the incapacity to control\r\nthe association of ideas by the attention, and that this incapacity\r\nresults from weakness of will; while ecstasy is a consequence of\r\nthe morbid irritability of special brain-centres. The incapacity\r\nof being attentive occasions, however, besides mysticism, other\r\neccentricities of the intellect, which may here be briefly mentioned.\r\nIn extreme stages of degeneration, _e.g._, in idiocy, attention is\r\nutterly wanting. No stimulus is able to arouse it, nor is there any\r\nexternal means of making an impression on the brain of the idiot, and\r\nawakening his consciousness to definite presentations. In less complete\r\ndegeneration, _i.e._, in cases of mental debility, attention may\r\nexist, but it is extremely weak and fleeting. Imbeciles (weak minds)\r\npresent, in graduated intensity, the phenomenon of fugitive thought\r\n(_Gedankenflucht_), _i.e._, the incapacity to retain, or to unite in a\r\nconcept or judgment, the representations automatically and reciprocally\r\ncalled into consciousness in conformity with the laws of association,\r\nand also that of reverie, which is another form of fugitive thought,\r\nbut which differs from it in that the particular representations of\r\nwhich it is composed are feebly elaborated, and are therefore shadowy\r\nand undefined, sometimes so much so that an imbecile, who in the\r\nmidst of his reveries is asked of what he is thinking, is not able\r\nto state exactly what happens to be present in his consciousness.\r\nAll observers maintain that the ‘higher degenerate’ is frequently\r\n‘original, brilliant, witty,’ and that whereas he is incapable of\r\nactivity which demands attention and self-control, he has strong\r\nartistic inclinations. All these peculiarities are to be explained by\r\nthe uncontrolled working of association.\r\n\r\nThe reader should recall the procedure of that brain which is incapable\r\nof attention. A perception arouses a representation which summons\r\ninto consciousness a thousand other associated representations. The\r\nhealthy mind suppresses the representations which are contradictory\r\nto, or not rationally connected with, the first perception. This the\r\nweak-minded cannot do. The mere similarity of sound determines the\r\ncurrent of his thought. He hears a word, and feels compelled to repeat\r\nit, once or oftener, sometimes to the extent of ‘Echolalia’; or it\r\ncalls into his consciousness other words similar to it in sound, but\r\nnot connected with it in meaning,[84] whereupon he thinks and talks in\r\na series of completely disconnected rhymes; or else the words have,\r\nbesides their similarity of sound, a very remote and weak connection\r\nof meaning; this gives rise to punning. Ignorant persons are inclined\r\nto call the rhyming and punning of imbeciles witty, not bearing in\r\nmind that this way of combining ideas according to the sound of the\r\nwords frustrates the purposes of the intellect by obscuring the\r\napprehension of the real connections of phenomena. No witticism has\r\never made easier the discovery of any truth. And whoever has tried to\r\nhold a serious conversation with a quibbling person of weak mind will\r\nhave recognised the impossibility of keeping him in check, of getting\r\nfrom him a logical conclusion, or of making him comprehend a fact or\r\na causal connection. When presentations are connected, not merely\r\naccording to auditory impressions of simple similarity of sound, but\r\nalso according to the other laws of association, those juxtapositions\r\nof words are effected which the ignorant designate as ‘original modes\r\nof expression,’ and which confer upon their originator the reputation\r\nof a ‘brilliant’ conversationalist or author. Sollier[85] cites\r\nsome characteristic examples of the ‘original’ modes of expression\r\nof imbeciles. One said to his comrade, ‘You look like a piece of\r\nbarley-sugar put out to nurse.’ Another expresses the thought that\r\nhis friend made him laugh so much he could not restrain his saliva,\r\nby saying, ‘Tu me fais baver des ronds de chapeaux.’ The junction\r\nof words which by their sense have little or no relation to each\r\nother is, as a rule, an evidence of imbecility, although it often\r\nenough is sensational and mirth-provoking. The cleverness which in\r\nParis is called _blague_, or _boulevard-esprit_, the psychologist\r\ndiscerns as imbecility. That this condition goes hand-in-hand with\r\nartistic tendencies is easy to understand. All callings which require\r\nknowledge of fact, and adaptation to it, presuppose attention. This\r\ncapacity is wanting in imbeciles; hence they are not fitted for\r\nserious professions. Certain artistic occupations, especially those\r\nof a subordinate kind, are, on the contrary, quite compatible with\r\nuncontrolled association of ideas, reverie, or fugitive thought,\r\nbecause they exact only a very limited adaptation to fact, and\r\ntherefore have great attractions for persons of weak intellect.\r\n\r\nBetween the process of thought and movement there exists an\r\nexact parallelism explicable by the fact that the elaboration of\r\npresentations is nothing else than a modification of the elaboration\r\nof the motor impulses. The phenomena of movement make the mechanism\r\nof thought more easily apprehensible to the lay mind. The automatic\r\nassociation of muscular contractions corresponds to the association of\r\nideas, their co-ordination to attention. As with defective attention\r\nthere ensues no intelligent thought, so with faulty co-ordination there\r\ncan be no appropriate movement. Palsy is equivalent to idiocy, St.\r\nVitus’s dance to obsessions and fixed ideas. The attempts at witticisms\r\nof the weak-minded are like beating the air with a sword; the notions\r\nand judgments of sound brains are like the careful thrust and parry of\r\nskilful fencing. Mysticism finds its reflected image in the aimless\r\nand powerless, often hardly discernible, movements of senile and\r\nparalytic trembling; and ecstasy is, for a brain-centre, the same state\r\nas a prolonged and violent tonic contraction for a muscle or group of\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PRE-RAPHAELITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTICISM is the habitual condition of the human race, and in no way\r\nan eccentric disposition of mind. A strong brain which works out every\r\npresentation to its full clearness--a powerful will, which sustains\r\nthe toiling attention--these are rare gifts. Musing and dreaming, the\r\nfree ranging of imagination, disporting itself at its own sweet will\r\nalong the meandering pathways of association, demand less exertion, and\r\nwill therefore be widely preferred to the hard labour of observation\r\nand intelligent judgment. Hence the consciousness of men is filled\r\nwith a vast mass of ambiguous, shadowy ideas; they see, as a rule, in\r\nunmistakable clearness only those phenomena which are daily repeated in\r\ntheir most intimate personal experience, and, among these, those only\r\nwhich are the objects of their immediate needs.\r\n\r\nSpeech, that great auxiliary in the interchange of human thought,\r\nis no unmixed benefit. It brings to the consciousness of most men\r\nincomparably more obscurity than brightness. It enriches their memory\r\nwith auditory images, not with well-defined pictures of reality. A\r\nword, whether written or spoken, excites a sense (sight or hearing),\r\nand sets up an activity in the brain. True; it always arouses\r\npresentation. A series of musical tones does the same. At an unknown\r\nword, at ‘Abracadabra,’ at a proper name, at a tune scraped on the\r\nfiddle, we also think of something, but it is either indefinite, or\r\nnonsensical, or arbitrary. It is absolute waste of labour to attempt to\r\ngive a man new ideas, or to widen the circle of his positive knowledge,\r\nby means of a word. It can never do more than awaken such ideas as he\r\nalready possesses. Ultimately everyone works only with the material for\r\npresentation which he has acquired by attentive personal observation of\r\nthe phenomena of the universe. Nevertheless, he cannot do without the\r\nstimulus conveyed to him by speech. The desire for knowledge, without\r\nany hiatus, of all that is in the world, is irresistible; while the\r\nopportunities of perception at first hand, even in the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, are limited. What we have not ourselves experienced\r\nwe let others, the dead and the living, tell us. The word must take\r\nthe place of the direct impressions of sense for us. And then it is\r\nitself an impression of sense, and our consciousness is accustomed\r\nto put this impression on a level with others, to estimate the idea\r\naroused by this word equally with those ideas which have been acquired\r\nthrough the simultaneous co-operation of all the senses, through\r\nobservations, and handling on every side, through moving and lifting,\r\nlistening to, and smelling the object itself. This parity of values\r\nis an error of thought. It is false in any case if a word do more\r\nthan call into consciousness a memory-image of a presentation, which\r\nit has acquired through personal experience, or a concept composed of\r\nsuch presentations. Nevertheless, we all of us commit this fallacy.\r\nWe forget that language was only developed by the race as a means of\r\ncommunication between individuals, that it is a social function, but\r\nnot a source of knowledge. Words are in reality much more a source\r\nof error. For a man can only actually know what he has directly\r\nexperienced and attentively observed, not what he has merely heard or\r\nread, and what he repeats; and if he would free himself from the errors\r\nwhich words have led him into, he has no other means than the increase\r\nof his sterling representative material, through personal experience\r\nand attentive observation. And since man is never in a position to do\r\nthis save within certain limits, everyone is condemned to carry on the\r\noperations of his consciousness with direct presentations, and at the\r\nsame time with words. The intellectual structure which is built up with\r\nmaterials of such unequal solidity reminds one of those dilapidated\r\nGothic churches which brainless masons used to patch up with a plaster\r\nof soot and cheese, giving it, by means of a wash, the appearance of\r\nstone. To the eye the frontage is irreproachable, but many parts of the\r\nbuilding could not for one moment resist a vigorous blow of criticism.\r\n\r\nMany erroneous explanations of natural phenomena, the majority of false\r\nscientific hypotheses, all religious and metaphysical systems, have\r\narisen in such a way that mankind, in their thoughts and opinions,\r\nhave interwoven, as equally valid components, ideas suggested by words\r\nonly, together with such as were derived from direct perception. The\r\nwords were either invented by mystics and originally indicated nothing\r\nbeyond the unbalanced condition of a weak and diseased brain, or,\r\nwhereas they at first expressed a definite, correct presentation, their\r\nproper meaning was not caught by those who repeated them, and by them\r\nwas arbitrarily falsified, differently interpreted, or blurred. Innate\r\nor acquired weakness of mind and ignorance lead alike to the goal of\r\nmysticism. The brain of the ignorant elaborates presentations that are\r\nnebulous, because they are suggested by words, not by the thing itself,\r\nand the stimulus of a word is not strong enough to produce vigorous\r\naction in the brain-cells; moreover, the brain of the exhausted and\r\ndegenerate elaborates nebulous presentations, because in any case it\r\nis not in a condition to respond to a stimulus by vigorous action.\r\nHence ignorance is artificial weakness of mind, just as, conversely,\r\nweakness of mind is the natural organic incapacity for knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn one part or another of his mental field of vision each of us\r\ntherefore is a mystic. From all the phenomena which he himself has not\r\nobserved, everyone forms shadowy, unstable presentations. Nevertheless,\r\nit is easy to distinguish healthy men from those who deserve the\r\ndesignation of mystic. There is a sure sign for each. The healthy man\r\nis in a condition to obtain sharply-defined presentations from his\r\nown immediate perceptions, and to comprehend their real connection.\r\nThe mystic, on the contrary, mixes his ambiguous, cloudy, half-formed\r\nliminal representations with his immediate perceptions, which are\r\nthereby disturbed and obscured. Even the most superstitious peasant\r\nhas definite presentations of his field work, of the feeding of his\r\ncattle, and of looking after his landmark. He may believe in the\r\nweather-witch, because he does not know how the rain comes to pass,\r\nbut he does not wait a moment for the angels to plough for him. He may\r\nhave his field blessed, because the real conditions of the thriving\r\nor perishing of his seed are beyond his ken, but he will never so\r\nput his trust in supernatural favour as to omit sowing his grain.\r\nAll the genuine mystic’s presentations, on the contrary, even those\r\nof daily experience, are permeated and overgrown with that which is\r\nincomprehensible, because it is without form. His want of attention\r\nmakes him incapable of apprehending the real connecting links between\r\nthe simplest and most obviously related phenomena, and leads him to\r\ndeduce them from one or another of the hazy, intangible presentations\r\nwavering and wandering in his consciousness.\r\n\r\nThere is no human phenomenon in the art and poetry of the century\r\nwith whom this characteristic of the mystic so completely agrees as\r\nwith the originators and supporters of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in\r\nEngland. It may be taken for granted that the history of this movement\r\nis known--at least, in its outlines--and that it will suffice here\r\nto recall briefly its principal features. The three painters, Dante\r\nGabriel Rossetti, Holman Hunt, and Millais, in the year 1848, entered\r\ninto a league which was called the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. After\r\nthe association was formed, the painters F. G. Stephens and James\r\nCollinson, and the sculptor Thomas Woolner, joined it. In the spring\r\nof 1849 they exhibited in London a number of pictures and statues, all\r\nof which, in addition to the signature of the artist, bore the common\r\nmark P.R.B. The result was crushing. Hitherto no hysterical fanatic\r\nhad tyrannically forced on the public a belief in the beauty of these\r\nworks, nor was it as yet under the domination of the fashion, invented\r\nby æsthetic snobs, of considering their admiration as a mark of\r\ndistinction, and of membership of a narrow and exclusive circle of the\r\naristocrats of taste. Hence it confronted them without prepossession,\r\nand found them incomprehensible and funny. The contemplation of them\r\nroused inextinguishable laughter among the good-humoured, and wrath\r\namong the morose, who are nettled when they think themselves made fools\r\nof. The brotherhood did not renew their attempt; the P.R.B. exhibition\r\nwas never repeated; the league broke up of itself. Its members no\r\nlonger added the shibboleth of initials after their names. They formed\r\nno longer a closed association, involving formal admission, but only\r\na loosely-knit circle, consisting of friends having tastes in common,\r\nand who were perpetually modifying its character by their joining and\r\nretiring. In this way it was joined by Burne Jones and Madox Brown, who\r\nalso passed for Pre-Raphaelites, although they had not belonged to the\r\noriginal P.R.B. Later on the designation was extended from painters to\r\npoets, and among the Pre-Raphaelites, in addition to D. G. Rossetti\r\n(who soon exchanged the brush for the pen), were Algernon Charles\r\nSwinburne and William Morris.\r\n\r\nWhat are the governing thoughts and aims of the Pre-Raphaelite\r\nmovement? An Anglo-German critic of repute, F. Hüffer,[86] thinks\r\nthat he answers this question when he says: ‘I myself should call\r\nthis movement the renaissance of mediæval feeling.’ Apart from the\r\nfact that these words signify nothing, since every man may interpret\r\n‘mediæval feeling’ as he pleases, the reference to the Middle Ages\r\nonly emphasizes the most external accompanying circumstance of\r\nPre-Raphaelitism, leaving its essence entirely untouched.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Pre-Raphaelites with both brush and pen betray a\r\ncertain, though by no means exclusive, predilection for the Middle\r\nAges; but the mediævalism of their poems and paintings is not\r\nhistorical, but mythical, and simply denotes something outside time\r\nand space--a time of dreams and a place of dreams, where all unreal\r\nfigures and actions may be conveniently bestowed. That they decorate\r\ntheir unearthly world with some features which may remotely recall\r\nmediævalism; that it is peopled with queens and knights, noble damozels\r\nwith coronets on their golden hair, and pages with plumed caps--these\r\nmay be accounted for by the prototypes which, perhaps unconsciously,\r\nhover before the eyes of the Pre-Raphaelites.\r\n\r\nMovements in art and literature do not spring up suddenly and\r\nspontaneously. They have progenitors from whom they descend in the\r\nnatural course of generation. Pre-Raphaelitism is the grandson of\r\nGerman, and a son of French, Romanticism. But in its wanderings\r\nthrough the world Romanticism has suffered such alteration through\r\nthe influence of the changing opinions of the times, and the special\r\ncharacteristics of various nations, that the English offspring bears\r\nscarcely any family resemblance to its German ancestor.\r\n\r\nGerman romanticism was in its origin a reaction against the spirit\r\nof the French encyclopædists, who had held undisputed sway over the\r\neighteenth century. Their criticism of ancient errors, their new\r\nsystems which were to solve the riddles of the world and of the nature\r\nof man, had at first dazzled and nearly intoxicated mankind. They could\r\nnot, however, satisfy in the long-run, for they committed a great\r\nfault in two respects. Their knowledge of facts was insufficient to\r\nenable them to explain the collective phenomenon of the universe, and\r\nthey looked upon man as an intellectual being. Proud of their strictly\r\nlogical and mathematical reasoning, they overlooked the fact that\r\nthis is a method of knowledge, but not knowledge itself. The logical\r\napparatus is a machine, which can manufacture only the material shot\r\ninto it. If the machine is not fed, it runs on empty and makes a noise,\r\nbut produces nothing. The condition of science in the eighteenth\r\ncentury did not allow the encyclopædists to make advantageous use of\r\ntheir logical machine. They did not take cognizance of this fact,\r\nhowever, and, with their limited material and much unconscious\r\ntemerity, constructed a system which they complacently announced\r\nas a faithful representation of the system of the universe. It was\r\nsoon discovered that the encyclopædists, for all their intellectual\r\narrogance, were deluding both themselves and their followers. There\r\nwere known facts which contradicted their hasty explanations, and there\r\nwas a whole range of phenomena of which their system took no account,\r\nand failed to cover as if with too short a cloak, and which peeped out\r\nmockingly at all the seams. Hence the philosophy of the encyclopædists\r\nwas kicked and abused, and the same faults were committed with\r\nrespect to it which it had perpetrated; the methods of intelligent\r\ncriticism were mistaken for the results obtained by them. Because\r\nthe encyclopædists, from lack of knowledge and of natural facts,\r\nexplained nature falsely and arbitrarily, those who were disappointed\r\nand thirsting for knowledge cried out, that intelligent criticism as\r\nsuch was a false method, that consistent reasoning led to nothing,\r\nthat the conclusions of the ‘Philosophy of Enlightenment’ were just as\r\nunproven and unprovable as those of religion and metaphysics, only less\r\nbeautiful, colder, and narrower; and mankind threw itself with fervour\r\ninto all the depths of faith and superstition, where certainly the Tree\r\nof Knowledge did not grow, but where beautiful mirages charmed the\r\neye, and the warm fragrant springs of all the emotions bubbled up.\r\n\r\nAnd more fatal than the error of their philosophy was the false\r\npsychology of the encyclopædists. They believed that the thoughts and\r\nactions of men are determined by reason and the laws of consistency,\r\nand had no inkling that the really impelling force in thought and deed\r\nare the emotions, those disturbances elaborated in the depths of the\r\ninternal organs, and the sources of which elude consciousness, but\r\nwhich suddenly burst into it like a horde of savages, not declaring\r\nwhence they come, submitting to no police regulations of a civilized\r\nmind, and imperiously demanding lodgment. All that wide region of\r\norganic needs and hereditary impulses, all that E. von Hartmann calls\r\nthe ‘Unconscious,’ lay hidden from the rationalists, who saw nothing\r\nbut the narrow circle of the psychic life which is illumined by the\r\nlittle lamp of consciousness. Fiction which should depict mankind\r\naccording to the views of this inadequate psychology would be absurdly\r\nuntrue. It had no place for passions and follies. It saw in the world\r\nonly logical formulæ on two legs, with powdered heads and embroidered\r\ncoats of fashionable cut. The emotional nature took its revenge on this\r\næsthetic aberration, breaking out in ‘storm and stress,’ and in turn\r\nattaching value only to the unconscious, the inherited impulse, and the\r\norganic appetites, while it neglected entirely reason and will, which\r\nare there none the less.\r\n\r\nMysticism, which rebelled against the application of the rationalistic\r\nmethods to explain the universe, and the _Sturm und Drang_, which\r\nrebelled against their application to the psychical life of mankind,\r\nwere the first-fruits of romanticism, which is nothing but the union\r\nand exaggeration of these two revolutionary movements. That it took\r\nup with fondness the form of mediævalism was due to circumstances and\r\nthe sentiment of the age. The beginnings of romanticism coincide with\r\nthe time of the deepest humiliation of Germany, and the suffering of\r\nyoung men of talent at the ignominy of foreign rule gave to the whole\r\ncontent of their thought a patriotic colouring. During the Middle\r\nAges Germany had passed through a period of the greatest power and\r\nintellectual florescence; those centuries which were irradiated at one\r\nand the same time by the might of the world-empire of the Hohenstaufen,\r\nby the splendour of the poems of the Court Minnesingers, and by the\r\nvastness of the Gothic cathedrals, must naturally have attracted those\r\nspirits who, filled with disgust, broke out against the intellectual\r\njejuneness and political abasement of the times. They fled from\r\nNapoleon to Frederick Barbarossa, and drew refreshment with Walter von\r\nder Vogelweide from their abhorrence of Voltaire. The foreign imitators\r\nof the German romanticists do not know that if in their flight from\r\nreality they come to a halt in mediævalism, they have German patriotism\r\nas their pioneer.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic side of romanticism was, moreover, emphasized only by\r\nthe sanest talents of this tendency. In others it stands revealed most\r\nsignally as a form of the phenomenon of degeneration. The brothers\r\nSchlegel, in their _Athenæum_, give this programme of romanticism:\r\n‘The beginning of all poetry is to suspend the course and the laws\r\nof rationally thinking reason, and to transport us again into the\r\nlovely vagaries of fancy and the primitive chaos of human nature....\r\nThe freewill of the poet submits to no law.’ This is the exact mode\r\nof thought and expression of the weak-minded, of the imbecile, whose\r\nbrain is incapable of following the phenomena of the universe with\r\ndiscernment and comprehension, and who, with the self-complacency which\r\ncharacterizes the weak-minded, proclaims his infirmity as an advantage,\r\nand declares that his muddled thought, the product of uncontrolled\r\nassociation, is alone exact and commendable, boasting of that for which\r\nthe sane-minded are pitying him. Besides the unregulated association\r\nof ideas there appears in most romanticists its natural concomitant,\r\nmysticism. That which enchanted them in the idea of the Middle Ages\r\nwas not the vastness and might of the German Empire, not the fulness\r\nand beauty of the German life of that period, but Catholicism with its\r\nbelief in miracles and its worship of saints. ‘Our Divine Service,’\r\nwrites H. von Kleist, ‘is nothing of the kind. It appeals only to cold\r\nreason. A Catholic feast appeals profoundly to all the senses.’ The\r\nobscure symbolism of Catholicism, all the externals of its priestly\r\nmotions, all its altar service so full of mystery, all the magnificence\r\nof its vestments, sacerdotal vessels and works of art, the overwhelming\r\neffect of the thunder of the organ, the fumes of incense, the flashing\r\nmonstrance--all these undoubtedly stir more confused and ambiguous\r\nadumbrations of ideas than does austere Protestantism. The conversion\r\nof Friedrich Schlegel, Adam Müller, Zacharias Werner, Count Stolberg,\r\nto Catholicism is just as consistent a result as, to the reader who\r\nhas followed the arguments on the psychology of mysticism, it is\r\nintelligible that, with these romanticists, the ebullitions of piety\r\nare accompanied by a sensuousness which often amounts to lasciviousness.\r\n\r\nRomanticism penetrated into France a generation later than into\r\nGermany. The delay is easy of historical explanation. In the storms\r\nof the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, the leading minds of\r\nthe French people had no time to think of themselves. They had no\r\nleisure for testing the philosophy of their encyclopædists, to find\r\nit inadequate, reject it, and rise up against it. They devoted their\r\nwhole energy to rough, big, muscular deeds of war, and the need for\r\nthe emotional exercise afforded by art and poetry, asserted itself\r\nbut feebly, being completely satisfied by the far stronger emotions of\r\nself-love and despair produced by their famous battles and cataclysmic\r\noverthrows. Æsthetic tendencies only reasserted their rights during\r\nthe half-dormant period following the battle of Waterloo, and then the\r\nsame causes led to the same results as in Germany. The younger spirits\r\nin this case also raised the flag of revolt against the dominating\r\næsthetic and philosophic tendencies. They wished Imagination to grapple\r\nwith Reason, and place its foot on its neck, and they proclaimed the\r\nmartial law of passion against the sober procedure of discipline and\r\nmorality. Through Madame de Staël and A. W. Schlegel, partly by the\r\nlatter’s personal intercourse with Frenchmen, and partly by his works,\r\nwhich were soon translated into French, they were in some measure\r\nmade acquainted with the German movement. They joined it perhaps half\r\nunconsciously. Of the many impulses which were active among the German\r\nromanticists, patriotism and Catholic mysticism had no influence on\r\nthe French mind, which only lent itself to the predilection for what\r\nwas remote in time and space, and what was free from moral and mental\r\nrestraints.\r\n\r\nFrench romanticism was neither mediæval nor pious. It took up its abode\r\nrather in the Renaissance period as regards remoteness in time, and in\r\nthe East or the realms of faerie, if it wished to be spacially remote\r\nfrom reality. In Victor Hugo’s works the one drama of _Les Burgraves_\r\ntakes place in the thirteenth century; but in all the others,\r\n_Cromwell_, _Maria Tudor_, _Lucrezia Borgia_, _Angelo_, _Ruy Blas_,\r\n_Hernani_, _Marion Delorme_, _Le Roi s’amuse_, the scenes were laid in\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and his one mediæval romance,\r\n_Notre Dame de Paris_, can be set over against all the rest, from _Han\r\nd’Islande_, which has for its scene of action a fancied Thule, to _Les\r\nMiserables_ and _1793_, which take place in an apocalyptic Paris and\r\nin a history of the Revolution suited to the use of hashish-smokers.\r\nThe bent of French romanticism towards the Renaissance is natural. That\r\nwas the period of great passions and great crimes, of marble palaces,\r\nof dresses glittering with gold, and of intoxicating revels; a period\r\nin which the æsthetic prevailed over the useful, and the fantastic\r\nover the rational, and when crime itself was beautiful, because\r\nassassination was accomplished with a chased and damascened poniard,\r\nand the poison was handed in goblets wrought by Benvenuto Cellini.\r\n\r\nThe French romanticists made use of the unreality of their scene\r\nof action and costumes chiefly for the purpose of enabling them,\r\nwithout restraint, to attribute to their characters all the qualities,\r\nexaggerated even to monstrosity, that were dear to the French, not\r\nyet ailing with the pain of overthrow. Thus in the heroes of Victor\r\nHugo, Alexandre Dumas, Théophile Gautier, Alfred de Musset, we become\r\nacquainted with the French ideal of man and woman. The subtle inquiries\r\nof Faust, the soliloquies of Hamlet, are not their affair. They talk\r\nunceasingly in dazzling witticisms and antitheses; they fight one\r\nagainst ten; they love like Hercules in the Thespidian night, and\r\ntheir whole life is one riot of fighting, wantoning, wine, perfume,\r\nand pageantry--a sort of magnificent illusion, with performance of\r\ngladiators, Don Juans, and Monte Christos; a crazy prodigality of\r\ninexhaustible treasures of bodily strength, gaiety and gold. These\r\nideal beings had necessarily to wear doublets or Spanish mantles,\r\nand speak in the tongues of unknown times, because the tightness of\r\nthe contemporary dress-coat could not accommodate all this wealth of\r\nmuscle, and the conversation of the Paris salon did not admit of the\r\ncandour of souls which their authors had turned inside out.\r\n\r\nThe fate of romanticism in England was exactly the reverse of that\r\nwhich befell it in France. Whereas the French had imitated chiefly, and\r\neven exclusively, in the German romanticists, their divergence from\r\nreality, and their declaration of the sovereign rights of the passions,\r\nthe English just as exclusively elaborated their Catholic and mystical\r\nelements. For them the Middle Ages had a powerful attraction, inasmuch\r\nas it was the period of childlike faith in the letter, and of the\r\nrevelling of simple piety in personal intercourse with the Trinity, the\r\nBlessed Virgin, and all the guardian saints.\r\n\r\nTrade, industry, and civilization were nowhere in the world so much\r\ndeveloped as in England. Nowhere did men work so assiduously, nowhere\r\ndid they live under such artificial conditions as there. Hence the\r\nstate of degeneration and exhaustion, which we observe to-day in all\r\ncivilized countries as the result of this over-exertion, must of\r\nnecessity have shown itself sooner in England than elsewhere, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, did show itself in the third and fourth decade of the\r\ncentury with continually increasing violence. In consequence, however,\r\nof the peculiarity of the English mind, the emotional factor in\r\ndegeneration and exhaustion necessarily assumed with them a religious\r\ncolouring.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon race is by nature healthy and strong-minded. It has\r\ntherefore, in a high degree, that strong desire for knowledge which\r\nis peculiar to normally-constituted persons. In every age it has\r\ninquired into the why and how of phenomena, and shown passionate\r\nsympathy with, and gratitude to, everyone who held out hopes of an\r\nexplanation of them. The well-known and deeply thoughtful discourse\r\nof the Anglican noble concerning what precedes and follows man’s\r\nlife--a speech which Bede has preserved for us in his account of the\r\nconversion of Edwin to Christianity--has been cited by all authors\r\n(_e.g._, by G. Freytag and H. Taine[87]) who have studied the origins\r\nof the English mental constitution. It shows that as early as the\r\nbeginning of the seventh century the Anglo-Saxons were consumed\r\nby an ardent desire to comprehend the phenomenon of the universe.\r\nThis fine and high-minded craving for knowledge has proved at once\r\nthe strength and the weakness of the English. It led with them to\r\nthe development along parallel lines of the natural sciences and\r\ntheology. The scientific investigators contributed a store of facts\r\nwon through toilsome observation; the experts in divinity obtained\r\ntheirs through systems compounded of notions arbitrarily conceived.\r\nBoth claimed to explain the nature of things, and the people were\r\ndeeply grateful to both, more so, it is true, to the theologians than\r\nto the scholars, because the former could afford to be more copious\r\nand confident in their teaching than the latter. The natural tendency\r\nto reckon words as equivalent to facts, assertions to demonstrations,\r\nalways gives theologians and metaphysicians an immense advantage over\r\nobservers. The craving of the English for knowledge has produced both\r\nthe philosophy of induction and spiritualism. Humanity owes to them\r\non the one hand Francis Bacon, Harvey, Newton, Locke, Darwin, J.\r\nS. Mill; on the other, Bunyan, Berkeley, Milton, the Puritans, the\r\nQuakers, and all the religious enthusiasts, visionaries, and mediums\r\nof this century. No people has done so much for, and conferred such\r\nhonour on, scientific investigators; no people has sought with so much\r\nearnestness and devotion for instruction, especially in matters of\r\nfaith, as have the English. Eagerness to know is, therefore, the main\r\nsource of English religiousness. There is this also to be noticed, that\r\namong them the ruling classes never gave an example of indifference\r\nin matters of faith, but systematically made religiousness a mark of\r\nsocial distinction; unlike France, where the nobility of the eighteenth\r\ncentury exalted Voltairianism into a symptom of good breeding. The\r\nevolution of history led in England to two results which apparently\r\nexclude each other--to caste-rule, and the liberty of the individual.\r\nThe caste which is in possession of wealth and power naturally wishes\r\nto protect its possessions. The rigid independence of the English\r\npeople precludes it from applying physical force. Hence it uses moral\r\nrestraints to keep the lower ranks submissive and amenable, and, among\r\nthese, religion is by far the most effective.\r\n\r\nHerein lies the explanation both of the devoutness of the English and\r\nof the religious character of their mental degeneration. The first\r\nresult of the epidemic of degeneration and hysteria was the Oxford\r\nMovement in the thirties and forties. Wiseman turned all the weaker\r\nheads. Newman went over to Catholicism. Pusey clothed the entire\r\nEstablished Church in Romish garb. Spiritualism soon followed, and\r\nit is worthy of remark that all mediums adopted theological modes of\r\nspeech, and that their disclosures were concerned with heaven and\r\nhell. The ‘revival meetings’ of the seventies, and the Salvation Army\r\nof to-day, are the direct sequel of the Oxford stream of thought, but\r\nrendered turbid and foul in accordance with the lower intellectual\r\ngrade of their adherents. In the world of art, however, the religious\r\nenthusiasm of degenerate and hysterical Englishmen sought its\r\nexpression in pre-Raphaelitism.\r\n\r\nAn accurate definition of the connotation of this word is an\r\nimpossibility, in that it was invented by mystics, and is as vague and\r\nequivocal as are all new word-creations of the feeble and deranged\r\nin mind. The first members of the Brotherhood believed that, in the\r\nartists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in the predecessors\r\nof the great geniuses of the Umbrian and Venetian schools, they\r\nhad discovered minds congenial to their own. For a short time they\r\ntook the methods of these painters for their models, and created\r\nthe designation ‘pre-Raphaelite.’ The term was bound to approve\r\nitself to them, since the prefix ‘pre’ (‘præ’) arouses ideas of the\r\nprimeval, the far-away, the hardly perceptible, the mysteriously\r\nshadowy. ‘Pre-Raphaelite’ calls up, through association of ideas,\r\n‘pre-Adamite,’[88] ‘prehistoric,’ etc.--in short, all that is opened\r\nto view by immeasurable vistas down the dusk of the unknown, and which\r\nallow the mind to wander dreamily beyond the limits of time and in the\r\nrealms of myth. But that the pre-Raphaelites should have lit on the\r\nquattrocento painters for the embodiment of their artistic ideals is\r\ndue to John Ruskin.\r\n\r\nRuskin is one of the most turbid and fallacious minds, and one of the\r\nmost powerful masters of style, of the present century. To the service\r\nof the most wildly eccentric thoughts he brings the acerbity of a\r\nbigot and the deep sentiment of Morel’s ‘emotionalists.’ His mental\r\ntemperament is that of the first Spanish Grand Inquisitors. He is a\r\nTorquemada of æsthetics. He would liefest burn alive the critic who\r\ndisagrees with him, or the dull Philistine who passes by works of art\r\nwithout a feeling of devout awe. Since, however, stakes do not stand\r\nwithin his reach, he can at least rave and rage in word, and annihilate\r\nthe heretic figuratively by abuse and cursing. To his ungovernable\r\nirascibility he unites great knowledge of all the minutiæ in the\r\nhistory of art. If he writes of the shapes of clouds he reproduces the\r\nclouds in seventy or eighty existing pictures, scattered amongst all\r\nthe collections of Europe. And be it noted that he did this in the\r\nforties, when photographs of the masterpieces of art, which render\r\nthe comparative study of them to-day so convenient, were yet unknown.\r\nThis heaping up of fact, this toilsome erudition, made him conqueror\r\nof the English intellect, and explains the powerful influence which he\r\nobtained over artistic sentiment and the theoretic views concerning\r\nthe beautiful of the Anglo-Saxon world. The clear positivism of the\r\nEnglishman demands exact data, measures, and figures. Supplied with\r\nthese he is content, and does not criticise starting-points. The\r\nEnglishman accepts a fit of delirium if it appears with footnotes,\r\nand is conquered by an absurdity if it is accompanied by diagrams.\r\nMilton’s description of hell and its inhabitants is as detailed and\r\nconscientious as that of a land-surveyor or a natural philosopher,\r\nand Bunyan depicts the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ to the mystical kingdom\r\nof Redemption in the method of the most graphic writer of travels--a\r\nCaptain Cook or a Burton. Ruskin has in the highest conceivable degree\r\nthis English peculiarity of exactness applied to the nonsensical, and\r\nof its measuring and counting applied to fevered visions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1843, almost simultaneously with the outbreak of the great\r\nCatholicizing movement, Ruskin began to publish the feverish studies\r\non art which were subsequently collected under the title of _Modern\r\nPainters_. He was then a young divinity student, and as such he entered\r\nupon the study of works of art. The old scholasticism wished to make\r\nphilosophy the ‘handmaid of godly learning.’ Ruskin’s mysticism had\r\nthe same purpose with regard to art. Painting and sculpture ought to\r\nbe a form of divine worship, or they ought not to exist at all. Works\r\nof art were valuable merely for the supersensuous thoughts that they\r\nconveyed, for the devotion with which they were conceived and which\r\nthey revealed, not for the mastery of form.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view he was able to arrive at judgments among\r\nwhich I here quote a few of the most typical. ‘It appears to me,’ he\r\nsays,[89] ‘that a rude symbol is oftener more efficient than a refined\r\none in touching the heart, and that as pictures rise in rank as works\r\nof art they are regarded with less devotion and more curiosity.... It\r\nis man and his fancies, man and his trickeries, man and his inventions,\r\npoor, paltry, weak, self-sighted man, which the connoisseur for ever\r\nseeks and worships. Among potsherds and dunghills, among drunken\r\nboors and withered beldames, through every scene of debauchery and\r\ndegradation, we follow the erring artist, not to receive one wholesome\r\nlesson, not to be touched with pity, nor moved with indignation, but\r\nto watch the dexterity of the pencil, and gloat over the glittering of\r\nthe hue.... Painting is nothing but a noble and expressive language,\r\ninvaluable as the vehicle of thought, but by itself nothing.... It is\r\nnot by the mode of representing and saying, but by what is represented\r\nand said, that the respective greatness either of the painter or the\r\nwriter is to be finally determined.... The early efforts of Cimabue\r\nand Giotto are the burning messages of prophecy, delivered by the\r\nstammering lips of infants.... The picture which has the nobler and\r\nmore numerous ideas, however awkwardly expressed, is a greater and a\r\nbetter picture than that which has the less noble and less numerous\r\nideas, however beautifully expressed.... The less sufficient the means\r\nappear to the end the greater will be the sensation of power.’ These\r\npropositions were decisive in determining the direction taken by\r\nthe young Englishmen of 1843, who united artistic inclinations with\r\nthe mysticism of the degenerate and hysterical. They comprise the\r\næstheticism of the first pre-Raphaelites, who felt that Ruskin had\r\nexpressed with clearness what was vaguely fermenting within them. Here\r\nwas the art-ideal which they had presaged--form as indifferent, idea\r\nas everything; the clumsier the representation, the deeper its effect;\r\nthe devotion of faith as the only worthy import of a work of art. They\r\nreviewed the history of art for phenomena agreeing with the theories\r\nof Ruskin, which they had taken up with enthusiasm, and they found\r\nwhat they sought in the archaic Italian school, in which the London\r\nNational Gallery is extraordinarily rich. There they had perfect models\r\nto imitate; they were bound to take for their starting-point these Fra\r\nAngelicos, Giottos, Cimabues, these Ghirlandajos and Pollajuolos. Here\r\nwere paintings bad in drawing, faded or smoked, their colouring either\r\noriginally feeble or impaired by the action of centuries; pictures\r\nexecuted with the awkwardness of a learner representing events in the\r\nPassion of Christ, in the life of the Blessed Virgin, or in the Golden\r\nLegend, symbolizing childish ideas of hell and paradise, and telling of\r\nearnest faith and fervent devotion. They were easy of imitation, since,\r\nin painting pictures in the style of the early masters, faulty drawing,\r\ndeficient sense of colour, and general artistic incapacity, are so many\r\nadvantages. And they constituted a sufficiently forcible antithesis\r\nto all the claims of the artistic taste of that decade to satisfy\r\nthe proclivity for contradiction, paradox, negation and eccentricity\r\nwhich we have learned to recognise as a special characteristic of the\r\nfeeble-minded.\r\n\r\nRuskin’s theory is in itself delirious. It mistakes the fundamental\r\nprinciples of æsthetics, and, with the unconsciousness of a saucy child\r\nat play, muddles and entangles the boundary lines of the different\r\narts. It holds of account in plastic art only the conception. A\r\npicture is valuable only in so far as it is a symbol giving expression\r\nto a religious idea. Ruskin does not take into consideration, or\r\ndeliberately overlooks the fact, that the pleasurable feelings which\r\nare produced by the contemplation of a picture are not aroused by\r\nits intellectual import, but by it as a sensuous phenomenon. The art\r\nof painting awakens through its media of colour and drawing (_i.e._,\r\nthe exact grasp and reproduction of differences in the intensity of\r\nlight), firstly, a purely sensuously agreeable impression of beautiful\r\nsingle colours and happily combined harmonies of colour; secondly, it\r\nproduces an illusion of reality and, together with this, the higher,\r\nmore intellectual pleasures arising from a recognition of the phenomena\r\ndepicted, and from a comprehension of the artist’s intention; thirdly,\r\nit shows these phenomena as seen with the eye of the artist, and brings\r\nout details or collective traits, which until then the inartistic\r\nbeholder had not been by himself able to perceive. The painter\r\ntherefore influences, through the medium of his art, only so far as he\r\nagreeably excites the sense of colour, gives to the mind an illusion of\r\nreality, together with the consciousness that it is an illusion, and,\r\nthrough his deeper, more penetrating vision, discloses to the spectator\r\nthe hidden treasures of the phenomenal world. If, in addition to the\r\npresentation of the picture, ‘its story’ also affects the beholder,\r\nit is no longer the merit of the painter as such, but of his not\r\nexclusively pictorial intelligence in making choice of a subject, and\r\nin committing its portrayal to his specific pictorial abilities. The\r\neffect of the story is not called forth through the media of painting;\r\nit is not based on the pleasure of the spectator in colour, on the\r\nillusion of reality, or on a better grasp of the phenomenon, but on\r\nsome pre-existing inclination, some memory, some prejudice. A purely\r\npainter’s picture, such as Leonardo’s _Mona Lisa_, charms everyone\r\nwhose eye has been sufficiently trained. A picture which tells a story,\r\nbut is not distinguished for its purely pictorial qualities, leaves\r\neveryone unappreciative to whom the story in itself is uninteresting,\r\n_i.e._, to whom it would in any case have been uninteresting, had it\r\nnot been executed by the instrumentality of pictorial art, but simply\r\nnarrated. A Russian eikon affects a moujik, and leaves the Western art\r\nconnoisseur cold. A painting which represents a French victory over\r\nRussian troops would excite and please a French Philistine, even if\r\nit were painted in the style of an Épinal. It is true, no doubt, that\r\nthere is a sort of painting which does not seek to seize and awaken\r\nvisual impressions in the spectator, together with the emotions which\r\nthey directly arouse, but to express ideas, and in which the picture is\r\nintended to affect the mind, not by itself and its own consummate art,\r\nbut by its spiritual significance. But this kind of painting has a\r\nspecial name: we call it writing. The signs, which are meant to have no\r\npictorial, but only symbolic value, where we turn away from the form in\r\norder to dwell upon their meaning, we call ‘letters,’ and the art which\r\nmakes use of such symbols for the expression of mental processes is not\r\npainting, but poetry. Originally, pictures were actually, no doubt,\r\na means of symbolizing thoughts, and their value as things of beauty\r\nwas considered of secondary importance in relation to their value as\r\nmeans of expression. On the other hand, æsthetic impressions still play\r\nin these days a subdued accompaniment to our writing, and a beautiful\r\nhandwriting, quite apart from its import, affects us more agreeably\r\nthan one that is ugly. At the very beginning of their evolution,\r\nhowever, the kind of painting which satisfied only æsthetic needs\r\nseparated itself from that of writing, which serves to render ideas\r\nperceptible to the senses. Descriptive drawing became the hieroglyph,\r\nthe demotic writing, the letter; and it was reserved for Ruskin to be\r\nthe first to try to annul a distinction which the scribes of Thebes had\r\nlearnt to make six thousand years before him.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Raphaelites, who got all their leading principles from Ruskin,\r\nwent further. They misunderstood his misunderstandings. He had simply\r\nsaid that defectiveness in form can be counter-balanced by devotion and\r\nnoble feeling in the artist. They, however, raised it to the position\r\nof a fundamental principle, that in order to express devotion and noble\r\nfeeling, the artist must be defective in form. Incapable, like all the\r\nweak-minded, of observing any process and of giving a clear account\r\nof it to themselves, they did not distinguish the real causes of the\r\ninfluence exercised over them by the old masters. The pictures touched\r\nand moved them; the most striking distinction between such pictures and\r\nothers, to which they were indifferent, was their awkward stiffness;\r\nthey did not look further, however, than this awkward stiffness for the\r\nsource of what touched and moved them, and imitated with great care and\r\nconscientiousness the bad drawing of the old masters.\r\n\r\nNow, the clumsiness of the old masters is certainly touching; but\r\nwhy? Because these Cimabues and Giottos were sincere. They wished to\r\nget closer to nature, and to free themselves from the thraldom of the\r\nByzantine school, which had become entirely unreal. They struggled with\r\nvehement endeavour against the bad habits of hand and eye which they\r\nhad acquired from the teachers of their guilds, and the spectacle of\r\nsuch a conflict, like every violent effort of an individuality which\r\nsets itself to rend fetters of any sort and save its own soul from\r\nbondage, is the most attractive thing possible to observe. The whole\r\ndifference between the old masters and the pre-Raphaelites is, that\r\nthe former had first to find out how to draw and paint correctly, while\r\nthe latter wished to forget it. Hence, where the former fascinate, the\r\nlatter must repel. It is the contrast between the first babbling of a\r\nthriving infant and the stammering of a mentally enfeebled gray-beard;\r\nbetween childlike and childish. But this retrogression to first\r\nbeginnings, this affectation of simplicity, this child’s play in word\r\nand gesture, is a frequent phenomenon amongst the weak-minded, and we\r\nshall often meet with it among the mystic poets.\r\n\r\nAccording to the doctrine of their master in theory, Ruskin, the\r\ndecline of art for pre-Raphaelites begins with Raphael--and for\r\nobvious reasons. To copy Cimabue and Giotto is comparatively easy.\r\nIn order to imitate Raphael it is necessary to be able to draw and\r\npaint to perfection, and this was just what the first members of the\r\nBrotherhood could not do. Moreover, Raphael lived in the most glorious\r\nperiod of the Renaissance. The rosy dawn of the New Thought shone in\r\nhis being and his work. With the liberal-mindedness of an enlightened\r\nCinquecentist, he no longer painted only religious subjects, but\r\nmythological and historical, or, as the mystics say, profane, subjects\r\nas well. His paintings appealed not only to the devotion of faith, but\r\nalso to the sense of beauty. They are no longer exclusively divine\r\nworship; consequently, as Ruskin says, and his disciples repeat,\r\nthey are devil-worship, and therefore to be rejected. Finally, it is\r\nconsistent with the tendency to contradiction, and to the repudiation\r\nof what is manifest, which governs the thoughts of the weak-minded,\r\nthat they should declare as false those tenets in the history of art\r\nwhich others than themselves deemed the most incontestable. The whole\r\nworld for three hundred years had said, ‘Raphael is the zenith of\r\npainting.’ To this they replied, ‘Raphael is the nadir of painting.’\r\nHence it came about that, in the designation which they appropriated,\r\nthey took up a direct allusion to Raphael, and to no other master or\r\nother portion of the history of art.\r\n\r\nConsistency of sequence and unity are not to be expected from mystical\r\nthought. It proceeds after its kind in perpetual self-contradiction. In\r\none place Ruskin says:[90] ‘The cause of the evil lies in the painter’s\r\ntaking upon him to modify God’s works at his pleasure, casting the\r\nshadow of himself on all he sees. Every alteration of the features of\r\nnature has its origin either in powerless indolence or blind audacity.’\r\nThus the painter should reproduce the phenomenon exactly as he sees it,\r\nand not suffer himself to make the smallest alteration in it. And a few\r\npages further on:[91] ‘There is an ideal form of every herb, flower,\r\nand tree; it is that form to which every individual of the species\r\nhas a tendency to attain, freed from the influence of accident or\r\ndisease.’ And, he continues, to recognise and to reproduce this ideal\r\nform is the one great task of the painter.\r\n\r\nThat one of these propositions completely nullifies the other it is\r\nhardly necessary to indicate. The ‘ideal form’ which every phenomenon\r\nstrives after does not stand before the bodily eyes of the painter. He\r\nreads it, according to some preconceived notion, into the phenomenon.\r\nHe has to deal with individual forms which, through ‘accident or\r\ndisease,’ have diverged from the ‘ideal form.’ In order to bring them\r\nback in painting to their ideal form, he must alter the object given\r\nby nature. Ruskin demands that he should do this, but at the same time\r\nsays that every alteration is an act of ‘powerless indolence or blind\r\naudacity.’ Naturally, only one of these mutually exclusive statements\r\ncan be true. Unquestionably it is the former. The ‘ideal form’ is an\r\nassumption, not a perception. The separation of the essential from the\r\naccidental, in the phenomenon, is an abstraction--the work of reason,\r\nnot of the eye or æsthetic emotion. Now, the subject-matter of painting\r\nis the visible, not the conjectural; the real, not the possible or\r\nprobable; the concrete, not the abstract. To exclude individual\r\nfeatures from a phenomenon as unessential and accidental, and to retain\r\nothers as intrinsic and necessary, is to reduce it to an abstract idea.\r\nThe work of art, however, is not to abstract, but to individualize.\r\nFirstly, because abstraction presupposes an idea of the law which\r\ndetermines the phenomenon, because this idea may be erroneous, because\r\nit changes with the ruling scientific theories of the day, whereas\r\nthe painter does not reproduce changing scientific theories, but\r\nimpressions of sense. Secondly, because the abstraction rouses the\r\nworking of thought, and not emotion, while the task of art is to excite\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the pre-Raphaelites had no eye for these contradictions,\r\nand followed blindly all Ruskin’s injunctions. They typified the human\r\nform, but they rendered all accessories truthfully, and had neither\r\n‘the blind audacity nor powerless indolence’ to change any of them.\r\nThey painted with the greatest precision the landscape in which their\r\nfigures stood, and the objects with which they were surrounded. The\r\nbotanist can determine every kind of grass and flower painted; the\r\ncabinet-maker can recognise the joining and glueing in every footstool,\r\nthe kind of wood and varnish in the furniture. Moreover, this\r\nconscientious distinctness is just the same in the foreground as in\r\nthe extreme background, where, according to the laws of optics, things\r\nshould be scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nThis uniformly clear reproduction of all the phenomena in the field of\r\nvision is the pictorial expression of the incapacity for attention. In\r\nintellection, attention suppresses a portion of that which is presented\r\nto consciousness (through association or perception), and suffers\r\nonly a dominant group of the latter to remain. In sight, attention\r\nsuppresses a portion of the phenomena in the field of vision in order\r\ndistinctly to perceive only that part which the eye can focus. To look\r\nat a thing is to see one object intently, and to disregard others. The\r\npainter must observe if he wishes to make clear to us what phenomenon\r\nhas engrossed him, and what his picture is to show us. If he does\r\nnot dwell observantly on a definite point in the field of vision,\r\nbut represents the whole field of view with the same proportion of\r\nintensity, we cannot divine what he wishes particularly to tell us, and\r\non what he wishes to direct our attention. Such a style of painting may\r\nbe compared to the disconnected speech of a weak mind, who chatters\r\naccording to the current of the association of ideas, wanders in his\r\ntalk, and neither knows himself what he wishes to arrive at, nor is\r\nable to make it clear to us; it is painted drivelling, echolalia of the\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nBut it is just this manner of painting which has gained for itself an\r\ninfluence on contemporary art. It is the pre-Raphaelite contribution to\r\nits evolution. The non-mystical painters have also learnt to observe\r\naccessories with precision, and to reproduce them faithfully; but\r\nthey have prudently avoided falling into the faults of their models,\r\nand nullifying the unity of their work by filling the most distant\r\nbackgrounds with still life, painted with painful accuracy. The lawns,\r\nflowers and trees, which they render with botanical accuracy, the\r\ngeologically correct rocks, surfaces of soil, and mountain structures,\r\nthe distinct patterns of carpets and wall-papers, which we find in the\r\nnew pictures, are traceable to Ruskin and the pre-Raphaelites.\r\n\r\nThese mystics believed themselves to be mentally affiliated with the\r\nOld Masters, because, like the latter, they painted religious pictures.\r\nBut in this they deceive themselves. Cimabue, Giotto and Fra Angelico\r\nwere no mystics, or, to put it more precisely, they are to be classed\r\nas mystics because of their ignorance, and not because of organic\r\nweakness of mind. The mediæval painter, who depicted a religious\r\nscene, was convinced that he was painting something perfectly true.\r\nAn Annunciation, a Resurrection, an Ascension, an event in the lives\r\nof the saints, a scene of life in paradise or in hell, possessed for\r\nhim the same incontestable character of reality as drinking bouts in\r\na soldier’s tavern, or a banquet in a ducal palace. He was a realist\r\nwhen he was painting the transcendental. To him the legend of his faith\r\nwas related as a fact; he was penetrated with a sense of its literal\r\ntruth, and reproduced it exactly as he would have done any other true\r\nstory. The spectator approached the picture with the same conviction.\r\nReligious art was the Bible of the poor. It had for the mediæval man\r\nthe same importance as the illustrations in the works on the history of\r\ncivilization, and on natural science, have in our day. Its duty was to\r\nnarrate and to teach, and hence it had to be exact. We know from the\r\ntouching stanza of Villon[92] how the illiterate people of the Middle\r\nAges regarded church pictures. The dissolute poet makes his mother say\r\nto the Virgin Mary:\r\n\r\n  ‘A pitiful poor woman, shrunk and old,\r\n  I am, and nothing learn’d in letter-lore;\r\n  Within my parish-cloister I behold\r\n  A painted Heaven where harps and lutes adore,\r\n  And eke an Hell whose damned folk seethe full sore:\r\n  One bringeth fear, the other joy to me.\r\n  That joy, great Goddess, make thou mine to be--\r\n  Thou of whom all must ask it even as I;\r\n  And that which faith desires, that let it see,\r\n  For in this faith I choose to live and die.’\r\n\r\nWith this sober faith a mystic mode of painting would be quite\r\nincompatible. The painter then avoided all that was obscure or\r\nmysterious; he did not paint nebulous dreams and moods, but positive\r\nrecords. He had to convince others, and could do so, because he was\r\nconvinced himself.\r\n\r\nIt was quite otherwise with the pre-Raphaelites. They did not paint\r\nsober visions, but emotions. They therefore introduced into their\r\npictures mysterious allusions and obscure symbols, which have nothing\r\nto do with the reproduction of visible reality. I need cite only one\r\nexample--Holman Hunt’s _Shadow of the Cross_. In this picture Christ\r\nis standing in the Oriental attitude of prayer with outstretched arms,\r\nand the shadow of his body, falling on the ground, shows the form of\r\na cross. Here we have a most instructive pattern of the processes of\r\nmystic thought. Holman Hunt imagines Christ in prayer. Through the\r\nassociation of ideas there awakes in him simultaneously the mental\r\nimage of Christ’s subsequent death on the cross. He wants, by the\r\ninstrumentality of painting, to make the association of these ideas\r\nvisible. And hence he lets the living Christ throw a shadow which\r\nassumes the form of a cross, thus foretelling the fate of the Saviour,\r\nas if some mysterious, incomprehensible power had so posed his body\r\nwith respect to the rays of the sun that a wondrous annunciation of\r\nhis destiny must needs write itself on the floor. The invention is\r\ncompletely absurd. It would have been childish trifling if Christ had\r\ndrawn his sublime death of sacrifice, whether in jest or in vanity,\r\nin anticipation, by his shadow on the ground. Neither would the\r\nshadow-picture have had any object, for no contemporary of Christ’s\r\nwould have understood the significance of the shadowed cross before\r\nhe had suffered death by crucifixion. In Holman Hunt’s consciousness,\r\nhowever, emotion simultaneously awakened the form of the praying\r\nChrist and of the cross, and he unites both presentations anyhow,\r\nwithout regard to their reasonable connection. If an Old Master had\r\nhad to paint the same idea, namely, the praying Christ filled with\r\nthe presentiment of his impending death, he would have shown us in\r\nthe picture a realistic Christ in prayer, and in a corner an equally\r\nrealistic crucifixion; but he would never have sought to blend both\r\nthese different scenes into a single one by a shadowy connection. This\r\nis the difference between the religious painting of the strong healthy\r\nbeliever and of the emotional degenerate mind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the pre-Raphaelites laid aside many of their\r\nearly extravagances. Millais and Holman Hunt no longer practise the\r\naffectation of wilfully bad drawing and of childish babbling in\r\nimitation of Giotto’s language. They have only retained, of the leading\r\nprinciples of the school, the careful reproduction of the unessential\r\nand the painting of the idea. A benevolent critic, Edward Rod,[93]\r\nsays of them: ‘They were themselves writers, and their painting is\r\nliterature.’ This speech is still applicable to the school.\r\n\r\nA few of the earliest pre-Raphaelites have understood it. They have\r\nrecognised in time that they had mistaken their vocation, and have gone\r\nover, from a style of painting which was merely thought-writing, to\r\ngenuine writing. The most notable among them is Dante Gabriel Rossetti,\r\nwho, though born in England, was the son of an Italian Carbonaro, and\r\na scholar of Dante. His father gave him the name of the great poet\r\nat his entrance into the world, and this expressive baptismal name\r\nbecame a constant suggestion, which Rossetti felt, and has, perhaps\r\nhalf unconsciously, admitted.[94] He is the most instructive example\r\nof the often-quoted assertion of Balzac, of the determining influence\r\nof a name on the development and destiny of its bearer. Rossetti’s\r\nwhole poetical feeling was rooted in Dante. His theory of life bears an\r\nindistinct cast of that of the Florentine. Through all his ideas there\r\nruns a reminiscence, faint or strong, of the _Divina Commedia_ or the\r\n_Vita Nuova_.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of one of his most celebrated poems, _The Blessed\r\nDamozel_, will show this parasitic battening on the body of Dante, and\r\nat the same time disclose some of the most characteristic peculiarities\r\nof the mental working of a mystic’s brain. The first strophe runs thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘The blessed damozel leaned out\r\n    From the gold bar of Heaven;\r\n  Her eyes were deeper than the depth\r\n    Of waters stilled at even;\r\n  She had three lilies in her hand,\r\n    And the stars in her hair were seven.’\r\n\r\nThe whole of this description of a lost love, who looks down upon him\r\nfrom a heaven imagined as a palace, with paradisiacal decorations, is\r\na reflection of Dante’s _Paradiso_ (Canto iii.), where the Blessed\r\nVirgin speaks to the poet from the moon. We even find details repeated,\r\n_e.g._, the deep and still waters ( ... ‘_ver per acque nitide e\r\ntranquille Non sì profonde, che i fondi sien persi ..._’). The ‘lilies\r\nin her hand’ he gets from the Old Masters, yet even here there is\r\na slight ring of the morning greeting from the _Purgatorio_ (Canto\r\nxxx.), ‘_Manibus o date lilia plenis._’ He designates his love by the\r\nAnglo-Norman word ‘damozel.’ By this means he makes any clear outlines\r\nin the idea of a girl or lady artificially blurred, and shrouds the\r\ndistinct picture in a veil of clouds. By the word ‘girl’ we should\r\njust think of a girl and nothing else. ‘Damozel’ awakens in the\r\nconsciousness of the English reader obscure ideas of slim, noble ladies\r\nin the tapestries of old castles, of haughty Norman knights in mail, of\r\nsomething remote, ancient, half forgotten; ‘damozel’ carries back the\r\ncontemporary beloved into the mysterious depths of the Middle Ages, and\r\nspiritualizes her into the enchanted figure of a ballad. This one word\r\nawakens all the crepuscular moods which the body of romantic poets and\r\nauthors have bequeathed as a residuum in the soul of the contemporary\r\nreader. In the hand of the ‘damozel’ Rossetti places three lilies,\r\nround her head he weaves seven stars. These numbers are, of course, not\r\naccidental. From the oldest times they have been reckoned as mysterious\r\nand holy. The ‘three’ and the ‘seven’ are allusions to something\r\nunknown, and of deep meaning, which the intuitive reader may try to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nIt must not be said that my criticism of the means by which Rossetti\r\nseeks to express his own dreamy states of mind, and to arouse similar\r\nstates in the reader, applies equally to all lyrics and poetry\r\ngenerally, and that I condemn the latter when I adduce the former as\r\nthe emanations of the mystic’s weakness of mind. All poetry no doubt\r\nhas this peculiarity, that it makes use of words intended not only\r\nto arouse the definite ideas which they connote, but also to awaken\r\nemotions that shall vibrate in consciousness. But the procedure of a\r\nhealthy-minded poet is altogether different from that of a weak-minded\r\nmystic. The suggestive word employed by the former has in itself an\r\nintelligible meaning, but besides this it is adapted to excite emotions\r\nin every healthy-minded man; and finally the emotions excited have all\r\nof them reference to the subject of the poem. One example will make\r\nthis clear. Uhland sings the _Praise of Spring_ in these words:\r\n\r\n  ‘Saatengrün, Veilchenduft,\r\n  Lerchenwirbel, Amselschlag,\r\n  Sonnenregen, linde Luft:\r\n  Wenn ich solche Worte singe,\r\n  Braucht es dann noch grosse Dinge,\r\n  Dich zu preisen, Frühlingstag?’[95]\r\n\r\nEach word of the first three lines contains a positive idea. Each\r\nof them awakens glad feelings in a man of natural sentiment. These\r\nfeelings, taken together, produce the mood with which the awakening of\r\nspring fills the soul, to induce which was precisely the intention of\r\nthe poet. When, on the other hand, Rossetti interweaves the mystical\r\nnumbers ‘three’ and ‘seven’ in the description of his ‘damozel,’ these\r\nnumbers signify nothing in themselves; moreover, they will call up\r\nno emotion at all in an intellectually healthy reader, who does not\r\nbelieve in mystical numbers; but even in the case of the degenerate and\r\nhysterical reader, on whom the cabbala makes impression, the emotions\r\nexcited by the sacred numbers will not involve a reference to the\r\nsubject of the poem, viz., the apparition of one loved and lost, but at\r\nbest will call up a general emotional consciousness, which may perhaps\r\ntell in a remote way to the advantage of the ‘damozel.’\r\n\r\nBut to continue the analysis of the poem. To the maiden in bliss it\r\nappears that she has been a singer in God’s choir for only one day;\r\nto him who is left behind this one day has been actually a matter of\r\nten years. ‘To one it is ten years of years.’ This computation is\r\nthoroughly mystical. It means, that is, absolutely nothing. Perhaps\r\nRossetti imagined that there may exist a higher unity to which the\r\nsingle year may stand as one day does to a year; that therefore 365\r\nyears would constitute a sort of higher order of year. The words ‘year\r\nof years’ therefore signified 365 years. But as Rossetti portrays\r\nthis thought vaguely and imperfectly, he is far from expressing it as\r\nintelligibly as this.\r\n\r\n  ‘It was the rampart of God’s house\r\n    That she was standing on;\r\n  By God built over the sheer depth\r\n    The which is space begun;\r\n  So high that, looking downward, thence\r\n    She scarce could see the sun.\r\n\r\n  ‘It lies in heaven, across the flood\r\n    Of ether, as a bridge.\r\n  Beneath, the tides of day and night\r\n    With flame and darkness ridge\r\n  The void, as low as where this earth\r\n    Spins like a fretful midge.\r\n\r\n  ‘Heard hardly, some of her new friends,\r\n    Amid their loving games,\r\n  Spake evermore among themselves\r\n    Their virginal chaste names,\r\n  And the souls mounting up to God\r\n    Went by her like thin flames.\r\n\r\n  ‘From the fixed place of Heaven she saw\r\n    Time like a pulse shake fierce\r\n  Through all the worlds....’\r\n\r\nI leave it to the reader to imagine all the details of this description\r\nand unite them into one complete picture. If he fail in this in spite\r\nof honest exertion, let him comfort himself by saying that the fault is\r\nnot his, but Rossetti’s.\r\n\r\nThe damozel begins to speak. She wishes that her beloved were already\r\nwith her. For come he will.\r\n\r\n  ‘“When round his head the aureole clings,\r\n  And he is clothed in white,\r\n  I’ll take his hand and go with him\r\n  To the deep wells of light.\r\n  We will step down as to a stream.\r\n  And bathe there in God’s sight.”’\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed how, in the midst of the turgid stream of these\r\ntranscendental senseless modes of speech, the idea of bathing together\r\ntakes a definite shape. Mystical reverie never fails to be accompanied\r\nby sensuality.\r\n\r\n  ‘“We two,” she said, “will seek the groves\r\n  Where the Lady Mary is,\r\n  With her five handmaidens, whose names\r\n  Are five sweet symphonies--\r\n  Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,\r\n  Margaret, and Rosalys.”’\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of these five feminine names, occupying two lines of\r\nthe stanza, is a method of versification characteristic of the mystic.\r\nHere the word ceases to be the symbol of a distinct presentation or\r\nconcept, and sinks into a meaningless vocal sound, intended only to\r\nawaken divers agreeable emotions through association of ideas. In this\r\ncase the five names arouse gliding shadowy ideas of beautiful young\r\nmaidens, ‘Rosalys’ those of roses and lilies as well; and the two\r\nverses together diffuse a glamour of faerie, as if one were roaming at\r\nease in a garden of flowers, where between lilies and roses slender\r\nwhite and rosy maidens pace to and fro.\r\n\r\nThe maiden in paradise goes on picturing to herself the union with her\r\nbeloved, and then:\r\n\r\n            ‘she cast her arms along\r\n    The golden barriers,\r\n  And laid her face between her hands\r\n    And wept--I heard her tears.’\r\n\r\nThese tears are incomprehensible. The blessed maiden after her death\r\nlives in the highest bliss, in a golden palace, in the presence of God\r\nand the Blessed Virgin. What pains her now? That her beloved is not yet\r\nwith her? Ten years of mortal men are to her as a single day. Even if\r\nit be her beloved’s destiny to live to be a very old man, she will at\r\nmost have to wait only five or six of her days until he appears at her\r\nside, and after this tiny span of time there blossoms for them both an\r\neternity of joy. It is not, therefore, obvious why she is distressed\r\nand sheds tears. This can only be attributed to the bewildered thoughts\r\nof the mystic poet. He imagines to himself a life of happiness after\r\ndeath, but at the same time there dawn in his consciousness dim\r\npictures of the annihilation of individuality, and of final separation\r\nthrough death, and those painful feelings are excited which we are\r\naccustomed to associate with ideas of death, decay, and separation\r\nfrom all we love. Hence it is that he comes to close an ecstatic hymn\r\nof immortality with tears, which have a meaning only if one does not\r\nbelieve in the continuation of life after death. In other respects\r\nalso there are contradictions in the poem which show that Rossetti had\r\nnot formed any one of his ideas so clearly as to exclude the opposite\r\nand incompatible. Thus, at one time the dead are dressed in white, and\r\nadorned with a galaxy of stars; they appear in pairs and call each\r\nother by caressing names; they must also be thought of as resembling\r\nhuman beings in appearance, while on another occasion their souls are\r\n‘thin flames’ which rustle past the damozel. Every single idea in the\r\npoem, when we try soberly to follow it out, infallibly takes refuge\r\nafter this manner in darkness and intangibility.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Divine Comedy,’ echoes of which are ever humming in Rossetti’s\r\nsoul, we find nothing of this kind. This was because Dante, like the\r\nOld Masters, was a mystic from ignorance, not from the weak-mindedness\r\nof degeneration. The raw material of his thought, the store of facts\r\nwith which he worked, was false, but the use his mind made of it was\r\ntrue and consistent. All his ideas were clear, homogeneous, and free\r\nfrom internal contradictions. His hell, his purgatory, his paradise,\r\nhe built up on the science of his times, which based its knowledge of\r\nthe world exclusively on dogmatic theology. Dante was familiar with the\r\nsystem of his contemporary, Thomas Aquinas (he was nine years old when\r\nthe Doctor Angelicus died), and permeated by it. To the first readers\r\nof the _Inferno_ the poem must have appeared at least as well founded\r\non fact and as convincing as, let us say, Häckel’s _Natural History of\r\nCreation_ does to the public of to-day. In coming centuries our ideas\r\nof an atom as merely a centre of force, of the disposition of atoms in\r\nthe molecule of an organic combination, of ether and its vibrations,\r\nwill perhaps be discerned to be just as much poetical dreams as the\r\nideas of the Middle Ages concerning the abode of the souls of the dead\r\nappear to us. But that is no reason why anyone should claim the right\r\nto designate Helmholtz or William Thompson as mystics, because they\r\nbase their work upon those notions which even to their minds do not\r\nto-day represent anything definite. For the same reason no one ought to\r\ncall Dante a mystic like a Rossetti. Rossetti’s _Blessed Damozel_ is\r\nnot based upon the scientific knowledge of his time, but upon a mist of\r\nundeveloped germs of ideas in constant mutual strife. Dante followed\r\nthe realities of the world with the keenly penetrating eyes of an\r\nobserver, and bore with him its image down to his hell. Rossetti is not\r\nin a condition to understand, or even to see the real, because he is\r\nincapable of the necessary attention; and since he feels this weakness\r\nhe persuades himself, in conformity with human habit, that he does not\r\nwish to do what in reality he cannot do. ‘What is it to me,’ he once\r\nsaid,[96] ‘whether the earth revolves around the sun or the sun around\r\nthe earth?’ To him it is of no importance, because he is incapable of\r\nunderstanding it.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to go so deeply into all Rossetti’s poems\r\nas into the _Blessed Damozel_; but it is also unnecessary, since we\r\nshould everywhere meet with the same mixture of transcendentalism and\r\nsensuality, the same shadowy ideation, the same senseless combinations\r\nof mutually incompatible ideas. Reference, however, must be made to\r\nsome of the peculiarities of the poet, because they characterize the\r\nbrain-work of weak degenerate minds.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes us is his predilection for refrains. The\r\nrefrain is an excellent artistic medium for the purpose of unveiling\r\nthe state of a soul under the influence of a strong emotion. It is\r\nnatural that, to the lover yearning for his beloved, the recurring idea\r\nof her should be ever thrusting itself among all the other thoughts in\r\nwhich he temporarily indulges. It is equally comprehensible that the\r\nunhappy being who is made miserable by thoughts of suicide should be\r\nunable to free himself from an idea which is in harmony with his mental\r\ncondition, say of an _Armensünderblum_, or ‘flower of the doomed soul,’\r\nwhich he sees when walking at night. (See Heine’s poem, _Am Kreuzweg\r\nwird begraben_, in which the line _die Armensünderblum_ is repeated at\r\nthe end of both strophes with peculiarly thrilling effect.)\r\n\r\nRossetti’s refrains, however, are different from this, which is\r\nnatural and intelligible. They have nothing to do with the emotion or\r\naction expressed by the poem. They are alien to the circle of ideas\r\nbelonging to the poem. In a word, they possess the character of an\r\nobsession, which the patient cannot suppress, although he recognises\r\nthat they are in no rational connection with the intellectual content\r\nof his consciousness. In the poem _Troy Town_ it is related how Helen,\r\nlong before Paris had carried her off, kneels in the temple of Venus\r\nat Sparta, and, drunken with the luxuriant beauty of her own body,\r\nfervently implores the Goddess of Love to send her a man panting for\r\nlove, where or whoever he might be, to whom she might give herself.\r\nThe absurdity of this fundamental idea it is sufficient to indicate in\r\npassing. The first strophe runs thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Heaven-born Helen, Sparta’s Queen\r\n              (O Troy town!),\r\n  Had two breasts of heavenly sheen,\r\n  The sun and the moon of the heart’s desire.\r\n  All Love’s lordship lay between.\r\n              (O Troy’s down,\r\n            Tall Troy’s on fire!)\r\n\r\n  ‘Helen knelt at Venus’ shrine\r\n              (O Troy town!)\r\n  Saying, “A little gift is mine,\r\n  A little gift for a heart’s desire.\r\n  Hear me speak and make me a sign!\r\n              (O Troy’s down,\r\n            Tall Troy’s on fire!)”’[97]\r\n\r\nAnd thus through fourteen strophes there constantly recurs, after the\r\nfirst line, ‘O Troy town!’ at the end of the third line, ‘heart’s\r\ndesire’; and after the fourth line, ‘O Troy’s down, tall Troy’s on\r\nfire!’ It is easy to discern what Rossetti wishes. In him there is\r\nrepeated the mental process which we recognised in Holman Hunt’s\r\npicture, _The Shadow of the Cross_. As by association of ideas, in\r\nthinking of Helen at Sparta, he hits upon the idea of the subsequent\r\nfate of Troy, so shall the reader, while he sees the young queen in\r\nSparta intoxicated by her own beauty, be simultaneously presented with\r\nthe picture of the yet distant tragical consequences of her longing\r\ndesire. But he does not seek to connect these two trains of thought\r\nin a rational way. He is ever muttering as he goes, monotonously as\r\nin a litany, the mysterious invocations to Troy, while he is relating\r\nthe visit to the temple of Venus at Sparta. Sollier[98] remarks this\r\npeculiarity among persons of feeble intellect. ‘Idiots,’ he says,\r\n‘insert words which have absolutely no connection with the object.’ And\r\nfurther on: ‘Among idiots constant repetition [_le rabâchage_] grows\r\ninto a veritable _tic_.’\r\n\r\nIn another very famous poem, _Eden Bower_,[99] which treats of the\r\npre-Adamite woman Lilith, her lover the serpent of Eden, and her\r\nrevenge on Adam, the litany refrain of ‘Eden Bower’s in flower,’ and\r\n‘And O the Bower and the hour,’ are introduced alternately after the\r\nfirst line in forty-nine strophes. As a matter of course, between these\r\nabsolutely senseless phrases and the strophe which each interrupts,\r\nthere is not the remotest connection. They are strung together without\r\nany reference to their meaning, but only because they rhyme. It is a\r\nstartling example of echolalia.\r\n\r\nWe frequently find this peculiarity of the weak and deranged mind,\r\n_i.e._, echolalia, in Rossetti. Here are a few proofs:\r\n\r\n  ‘So wet she comes to wed’ (_Stratton Water_).\r\n\r\nHere the sound ‘wed’ has called up the sound ‘wet.’ In the poem _My\r\nSisters Sleep_, in one place where the moon is spoken of, it is said:\r\n\r\n  ‘The hollow halo it was in\r\n  Was like an icy crystal cup.’\r\n\r\nIt is stark nonsense to qualify a plane surface such as a halo by the\r\nadjective ‘hollow.’ The adjective and noun mutually exclude each other,\r\nbut the rhyming assonance has joined ‘hollow’ to ‘halo.’ With this we\r\nmay also compare the line:\r\n\r\n  ‘Yet both were ours, but hours will come and go’\r\n  (_A New Year’s Burden_),\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  ‘Forgot it not, nay, but got it not’ (_Beauty_).\r\n\r\nMany of Rossetti’s poems consist of the stringing together of wholly\r\ndisconnected words, and to mystic readers these absurdities seem\r\nnaturally to have the deepest meaning. I should like to cite but one\r\nexample. The second strophe of the _Song of the Bower_ says:\r\n\r\n  ‘... My heart, when it flies to thy bower,\r\n  What does it find there that knows it again?\r\n  There it must droop like a shower-beaten flower,\r\n  Red at the rent core and dark with the rain.\r\n  Ah! yet what shelter is still shed above it--\r\n  What waters still image its leaves torn apart?\r\n  Thy soul is the shade that clings round it to love it,\r\n  And tears are its mirror deep down in thy heart.’[100]\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of such series of words is, that each single word has\r\nan emotional meaning of its own (such as ‘heart,’ ‘bower,’ ‘flies,’\r\n‘droop,’ ‘flower,’ ‘rent,’ ‘dark,’ ‘lone,’ ‘tears,’ etc.), and that\r\nthey follow each other with a cradled rhythm and ear-soothing rhyme.\r\nHence they easily arouse in the emotional and inattentive reader a\r\ngeneral emotion, as does a succession of musical tones in a minor key.\r\nAnd the reader fancies that he understands the strophe, while he, as a\r\nmatter of fact, only interprets his own emotion according to his own\r\nlevel of culture, his character, and his recollections of what he has\r\nread.\r\n\r\nBesides Dante Gabriel Rossetti, it has been customary to include\r\nSwinburne and Morris among the pre-Raphaelite poets. But the similarity\r\nbetween these two and the head of the school is remote. Swinburne is,\r\nin Magnan’s phrase, a ‘higher degenerate,’ while Rossetti should be\r\ncounted among Sollier’s imbeciles. Swinburne is not so emotional as\r\nRossetti, but he stands on a much higher mental plane. His thought\r\nis false and frequently delirious, but he has thoughts, and they are\r\nclear and connected. He is mystical, but his mysticism partakes more\r\nof the depraved and the criminal than of the paradisiacal and divine.\r\nHe is the first representative of ‘Diabolism’ in English poetry. This\r\nis because he has been influenced, not only by Rossetti, but also and\r\nespecially by Baudelaire. Like all ‘degenerates,’ he is extraordinarily\r\nsusceptible to suggestion, and, consciously or unconsciously, he has\r\nimitated, one after another, all the strongly-marked poetic geniuses\r\nthat have come under his notice. He was an echo of Rossetti and\r\nBaudelaire, as he was of Gautier and Victor Hugo, and in his poems it\r\nis possible to trace the course of his reading step by step.\r\n\r\nCompletely Rossettian, for example, is _A Christmas Carol_.[101]\r\n\r\n  ‘Three damsels in the queen’s chamber,\r\n  The queen’s mouth was most fair;\r\n  She spake a word of God’s mother,\r\n  As the combs went in her hair.\r\n  “Mary that is of might,\r\n  Bring us to thy Son’s sight.”’\r\n\r\nHere we find a mystical content united to the antiquarianism and\r\nchildish phraseology of genuine pre-Raphaelitism. _The Masque of\r\nQueen Bersabe_ is worked out on the same model, being an imitation\r\nof the mediæval miracle-play, with its Latin stage directions and\r\npuppet-theatre style. This, in its turn, has become the model of many\r\nFrench poems, in which there is only a babbling and stammering and a\r\ncrawling on all fours, as if in a nursery.\r\n\r\nWhere he walks in Baudelaire’s footsteps, Swinburne tries to distort\r\nhis face to a diabolical mien, and makes the woman say (in _Anactoria_)\r\nto the other unnaturally loved woman:\r\n\r\n  ‘I would my love could kill thee. I am satiated\r\n  With seeing thee live, and fain would have thee dead.\r\n  I would earth had thy body as fruit to eat,\r\n  And no mouth but some serpent’s found thee sweet.\r\n  I would find grievous ways to have thee slain,\r\n  Intense device, and superflux of pain;\r\n                            ... O! that I\r\n  Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die--\r\n  Die of thy pain and my delight, and be\r\n  Mixed with thy blood and molten unto thee.’\r\n\r\nOr, when he curses and reviles, as in _Before Dawn_:\r\n\r\n  ‘To say of shame--what is it?\r\n  Of virtue--we can miss it,\r\n  Of sin--we can but kiss it,\r\n  And it’s no longer sin.’\r\n\r\nOne poem deserves a more detailed analysis, because it contains\r\nunmistakably the germ of the later ‘symbolism,’ and is an instructive\r\nexample of this form of mysticism. The poem is _The King’s Daughter_.\r\nIt is a sort of ballad, which in fourteen four-lined stanzas relates\r\na fairy story about the ten daughters of a king, of whom one was\r\npreferred before the remaining nine, was beautifully dressed, pampered\r\nwith the most costly food, slept in a soft bed, and received the\r\nattentions of a handsome prince, while her sisters remained neglected;\r\nbut instead of finding happiness at the prince’s side, she became\r\ndeeply wretched and wished she were dead. In the first and third\r\nlines of every stanza the story is rehearsed. The second line speaks\r\nof a mythical mill-stream, which comes into the ballad one knows not\r\nhow, and which always, by some mysterious influence, symbolically\r\nreflects all the changes that take place as the action of the ballad\r\nprogresses; while the fourth line contains a litany-like exclamation,\r\nwhich likewise makes a running reference to the particular stage\r\nreached in the narrative.\r\n\r\n  ‘We were ten maidens in the green corn,\r\n    Small red leaves in the mill-water:\r\n  Fairer maidens never were born,\r\n    Apples of gold for the King’s daughter.\r\n\r\n  ‘We were ten maidens by a well-head,\r\n    Small white birds in the mill-water:\r\n  Sweeter maidens never were wed,\r\n    Rings of red for the King’s daughter.’\r\n\r\nIn the following stanzas the admirable qualities of each of the ten\r\nprincesses are portrayed, and the symbolical intermediate lines run\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n ‘Seeds of wheat in the mill-water-- ... White bread and brown for\r\n the King’s daughter-- ... Fair green weed in the mill-water-- ...\r\n White wine and red for the King’s daughter-- ... Fair thin reeds in\r\n the mill-water-- ... Honey in the comb for the King’s daughter-- ...\r\n Fallen flowers in the mill-water-- ... Golden gloves for the King’s\r\n daughter-- ... Fallen fruit in the mill-water-- ... Golden sleeves for\r\n the King’s daughter-- ...’\r\n\r\nThe King’s son then comes, chooses the one princess and disdains the\r\nother nine. The symbolical lines point out the contrast between the\r\nbrilliant fate of the chosen one and the gloomy destiny of the despised\r\nsisters:\r\n\r\n ‘A little wind in the mill-water; A crown of red for the King’s\r\n daughter--A little rain in the mill-water; A bed of yellow straw for\r\n all the rest; A bed of gold for the King’s daughter--Rain that rains\r\n in the mill-water; A comb of yellow shell for all the rest,--A comb\r\n of gold for the King’s daughter--Wind and hail in the mill-water;\r\n A grass girdle for all the rest, A girdle of arms for the King’s\r\n daughter--Snow that snows in the mill-water; Nine little kisses for\r\n all the rest, An hundredfold for the King’s daughter.’\r\n\r\nThe King’s daughter thus appears to be very fortunate, and to be envied\r\nby her nine sisters. But this happiness is only on the surface, for the\r\npoem now suddenly changes:\r\n\r\n  ‘Broken boats in the mill-water;\r\n  Golden gifts for all the rest,\r\n  Sorrow of heart for the King’s daughter.\r\n\r\n  ‘“Ye’ll make a grave for my fair body,”\r\n  Running rain in the mill-water;\r\n  “And ye’ll streek my brother at the side of me,”\r\n  The pains of hell for the King’s daughter.’\r\n\r\nWhat has brought about this change in her fate the poet purposely\r\nleaves obscure. Perhaps he wishes to have us understand that the King’s\r\nson has no right to sue for her hand, being her brother, and that the\r\nchosen princess for shame at the incest perishes. This would be in\r\nkeeping with Swinburne’s childish devilry. But I am not dwelling on\r\nthis aspect of the poem, but on its symbolism.\r\n\r\nIt is psychologically justifiable that a subjective connection should\r\nbe set up between our states of mind for the time being and phenomena;\r\nthat we should perceive in the external world a reflection of our\r\nmoods. If the external world shows a well-marked emotional character,\r\nit awakens in us the mood corresponding to it; and conversely, if\r\nwe are under the influence of some pronounced feeling, we notice,\r\nin accordance with the mechanism of attention, only those features\r\nof nature which are in harmony with our mood, which intensify and\r\nsustain it, while the opposing phenomena we neither observe nor even\r\nperceive. A gloomy ravine overhung by a cloudy sky makes us sad. This\r\nis one form of associating our humour with the outer world. But if we\r\nfrom any cause are already sad, we find some corresponding sadness in\r\nall the scenes around us--in the streets of the metropolis ragged,\r\nstarved-looking children, thin, miserably kept cab-horses, a blind\r\nbeggar-woman; in the woods withered, mouldering leaves, poisonous\r\nfungi, slimy slugs, etc. If we are joyous, we see just the same\r\nobjects, but take no notice of them, perceiving only beside them, in\r\nthe street, a wedding procession, a fresh young maiden with a basket of\r\ncherries on her arm, gaily-coloured placards, a funny fat man with his\r\nhat on the back of his head; in the woods, birds flitting by, dancing\r\nbutterflies, little white anemones, etc. Here we have the other form\r\nof that association. The poet has a perfect right to make use of both\r\nthese forms. If Heine sings:\r\n\r\n  ‘Es ragt ins Meer der Runenstein,\r\n  Da sitz ich mit meinen Träumen;\r\n  Es pfeift der Wind, die Möwen schrein,\r\n  Die Wellen, die wandern und schäumen.\r\n\r\n  ‘Ich habe geliebt manch schönes Kind\r\n  Und manchen guten Gesellen--\r\n  Wo sind sie hin?--Es pfeift der Wind,\r\n  Es schäumen und wandern die Wellen,’[102]\r\n\r\nhe brings his own mournful, melancholy frame of mind with him. He\r\nbemoans the fleetingness of man’s life, the impermanence of the\r\nfeelings, the shadowy passing by and away of beloved companions. In\r\nthis state he looks out over the sea from the shore where he sits,\r\nand perceives only those objects that are in keeping with his humour\r\nand give it embodiment: the driving gust of wind, the hurrying gulls,\r\nnow seen, now lost to sight, the rolling in and trackless ebbing of\r\nthe surf. These features of an ocean scene become symbols of what\r\nis passing through the poet’s mind, and this symbolism is sound and\r\nfounded on the laws of thought.\r\n\r\nSwinburne’s symbolism is of quite another kind. He does not let\r\nthe external world express a mood, but makes it tell a story; he\r\nchanges its appearance according to the character of the event he\r\nis describing. Like an orchestra, it accompanies all events which\r\nsomewhere are taking place. Here nature is no longer a white wall\r\non which, as in a game of shadows, the varied visions of the soul\r\nare thrown; but a living, thinking being, which follows the sinful\r\nlove-romance with the same tense sympathy as the poet, and which,\r\nwith its own media, expresses just as much as he does--complacency,\r\ndelight, or sorrow--at every chapter of the story. This is a purely\r\ndelirious idea. It corresponds in art and poetry to hallucination in\r\nmental disease. It is a form of mysticism, which is met with in all\r\nthe degenerate. Just as in Swinburne the mill-water drives ‘small red\r\nleaves,’ and, what is certainly more curious, ‘little white birds,’\r\nwhen everything is going on well, and on the other hand is lashed\r\nby snow and hail, and tosses shattered boats about, if things take\r\nan adverse turn; so, in Zola’s _Assommoir_, the drain from a dyeing\r\nfactory carries off fluid of a rosy or golden hue on days of happiness,\r\nbut a black or gray-coloured stream if the fates of Gervaise and\r\nLantier grow dark with tragedy. Ibsen, too, in his _Ghosts_, makes it\r\nrain in torrents if Frau Alving and her son are in sore trouble, while\r\nthe sunshine breaks forth just as the catastrophe is about to occur.\r\nIbsen, moreover, goes farther in this hallucinatory symbolism than the\r\nothers, since with him Nature not only plays an active part, but shows\r\nscornful malice--she not only furnishes an expressive accompaniment to\r\nthe events, but makes merry over them.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris is intellectually far more healthy than Rossetti and\r\nSwinburne. His deviations from mental equilibrium betray themselves,\r\nnot through mysticism, but through a want of individuality, and\r\nan overweening tendency to imitation. His affectation consists in\r\nmediævalism. He calls himself a pupil of Chaucer.[103] He artlessly\r\ncopies whole stanzas also from Dante, _e.g._, the well-known Francesca\r\nand Paolo episode from Canto V. of the _Inferno_, when he writes in his\r\n_Guenevere_:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ‘In that garden fair\r\n  Came Lancelot walking; this is true, the kiss\r\n  Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,\r\n  I scarce dare talk of the remembered bliss.’\r\n\r\nMorris persuades himself that he is a wandering minstrel of the\r\nthirteenth or fourteenth century, and takes much trouble to look at\r\nthings in such a way, and express them in such language, as would\r\nhave befitted a real contemporary of Chaucer. Beyond this poetical\r\nventriloquism, so to speak, with which he seeks so to alter the sound\r\nof his voice that it may appear to come from far away to our ear, there\r\nare not many features of degeneracy in him to notice. But he sometimes\r\nfalls into outspoken echolalia, _e.g._, in a stanza of the _Earthly\r\nParadise_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Of Margaret sitting glorious there,\r\n  In glory of gold and glory of hair,\r\n  And glory of glorious face most fair’--\r\n\r\nwhere ‘glory’ and ‘glorious’ are repeated five times in three lines.\r\nHis emotional activity in recent years has made him an adherent\r\nof a vague socialism, consisting chiefly of love and pity for his\r\nfellow-men, and which has an odd effect when expressed artistically in\r\nthe language of the old ballads.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Raphaelites have for twenty years exercised a great influence\r\non the rising generation of English poets. All the hysterical and\r\ndegenerate have sung with Rossetti of ‘damozels’ and of the Virgin\r\nMary, have with Swinburne eulogized unnatural license, crime, hell,\r\nand the devil. They have, with Morris, mangled language in bardic\r\nstrains, and in the manner of the _Canterbury Tales_; and if the whole\r\nof English poetry is not to-day unmitigatedly pre-Raphaelite, it is\r\ndue merely to the fortunate accident that, contemporaneously with the\r\npre-Raphaelites, so sound a poet as Tennyson has lived and worked.\r\nThe official honours bestowed on him as Poet Laureate, his unexampled\r\nsuccess among readers, pointed him out to a part at least of the petty\r\nstrugglers and aspirants as worthy of imitation, and so it comes about\r\nthat among the chorus of the lily-bearing mystics there are also heard\r\nother street-singers who follow the poet of the _Idylls of the King_.\r\n\r\nIn its further development pre-Raphaelitism in England degenerated\r\ninto ‘æstheticism,’ and in France into ‘symbolism.’ With both of these\r\ntendencies we must deal more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSYMBOLISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMILAR phenomenon to that which we observed in the case of the\r\npre-Raphaelites is afforded by the French Symbolists. We see a number\r\nof young men assemble for the purpose of founding a school. It assumes\r\na special title, but in spite of all sorts of incoherent cackle and\r\nsubsequent attempts at mystification it has, beyond this name, no\r\nkind of general artistic principle or clear æsthetic ideal. It only\r\nfollows the tacit, but definitely recognisable, aim of making a noise\r\nin the world, and by attracting the attention of men through its\r\nextravagances, of attaining celebrity and profit, and the gratification\r\nof all the desires and conceits agitating the envious souls of these\r\nfilibusters of fame.\r\n\r\nShortly after 1880 there was, in the Quartier Latin in Paris, a group\r\nof literary aspirants, all about the same age, who used to meet in an\r\nunderground café at the Quai St. Michel, and, while drinking beer,\r\nsmoking and quibbling late into the night, or early hours of the\r\nmorning, abused in a scurrilous manner the well-known and successful\r\nauthors of the day, while boasting of their own capacity, as yet\r\nunrevealed to the world.\r\n\r\nThe greatest talkers among them were Emile Goudeau, a chatterbox\r\nunknown save as the author of a few silly satirical verses; Maurice\r\nRollinat, the author of _Les Névroses_; and Edmond Haraucourt, who now\r\nstands in the front rank of French mystics. They called themselves the\r\n‘Hydropaths,’ an entirely meaningless word, which evidently arose out\r\nof an indistinct reminiscence of both ‘hydrotherapy’ and ‘neuropath,’\r\nand which was probably intended, in the characteristic vagueness of the\r\nmystic thought of the weak-minded, to express only the general idea\r\nof people whose health is not satisfactory, who are ailing and under\r\ntreatment. In any case there is, in the self-chosen name, a suggestion\r\nof shattered nervous vitality vaguely felt and admitted. The group,\r\nmoreover, owned a weekly paper _Lutèce_, which ceased after a few\r\nissues.[104]\r\n\r\nAbout 1884 the society left their paternal pot-house, and pitched\r\ntheir tent in the Café François I., Boulevard St. Michel. This _café_\r\nattained a high renown. It was the cradle of Symbolism. It is still the\r\ntemple of a few ambitious youths, who hope, by joining the Symbolist\r\nschool, to acquire that advancement which they could not expect\r\nfrom their own abilities. It is, too, the Kaaba to which all foreign\r\nimbeciles make a pilgrimage, those, that is, who have heard of the new\r\nParisian tendency, and wish to become initiated into its teachings\r\nand mysteries. A few of the Hydropaths did not join in the change\r\nof quarters, and their places were taken by fresh auxiliaries--Jean\r\nMoréas, Laurent Tailhade, Charles Morice, etc. These dropped the old\r\nname, and were known for a short time as the ‘Décadents.’ This had been\r\napplied to them by a critic in derision, but just as the ‘Beggars’ of\r\nthe Netherlands proudly and truculently appropriated the appellation\r\nbestowed in contempt and mockery, so the ‘Décadents’ stuck in their\r\nhats the insult, which had been cast in their faces, as a sign of\r\nmutiny against criticism. Soon, however, these original guests of the\r\nFrançois I. became tired of their name, and Moréas invented for them\r\nthe designation of ‘Symbolists,’ under which they became generally\r\nknown, while a special smaller group, who had separated themselves from\r\nthe Symbolists, continued to retain the title of ‘Décadents.’\r\n\r\nThe Symbolists are a remarkable example of that group-forming tendency\r\nwhich we have learnt to know as a peculiarity of ‘degenerates.’ They\r\nhad in common all the signs of degeneracy and imbecility: overweening\r\nvanity and self-conceit, strong emotionalism, confused disconnected\r\nthoughts, garrulity (the ‘logorrhœa’ of mental therapeutics), and\r\ncomplete incapacity for serious sustained work. Several of them had had\r\na secondary education, others even less. All of them were profoundly\r\nignorant, and being unable, through weakness of will and inability\r\nto pay attention, to learn anything systematically, they persuaded\r\nthemselves, in accordance with a well-known psychological law, that\r\nthey despised all positive knowledge, and held that only dreams and\r\ndivinings, only ‘intuitions,’ were worthy of human beings. A few of\r\nthem, like Moréas and Guaita, who afterwards became a ‘magian,’ read in\r\na desultory fashion all sorts of books which chanced to fall into their\r\nhands at the _bouquinistes_ of the Quais, and delivered themselves of\r\nthe snatched fruits of their reading in grandiloquent and mysterious\r\nphrases before their comrades. Their listeners thereupon imagined that\r\nthey had indulged in an exhausting amount of study, and in this way\r\nthey acquired that intellectual lumber which they peddled out in such\r\nan ostentatious display in their articles and pamphlets, and in which\r\nthe mentally sane reader, to his amused astonishment, meets with the\r\nnames of Schopenhauer, Darwin, Taine, Renan, Shelley and Goethe; names\r\nemployed to label the shapeless, unrecognisable rubbish-heaps of a\r\nmental dustbin, filled with raw scraps of uncomprehended and insolently\r\nmutilated propositions and fragments of thought, dishonestly extracted\r\nand appropriated. This ignorance on the part of the Symbolists, and\r\ntheir childish flaunting of a pretended culture, are openly admitted by\r\none of them. ‘Very few of these young men,’ says Charles Morice,[105]\r\n‘have any exact knowledge of the tenets of religion or philosophy.\r\nFrom the expressions used in the Church services, however, they retain\r\nsome fine terms, such as “monstrance,” “ciborium,” etc.; several have\r\npreserved from Spencer, Mill, Shopenhauer (_sic!_), Comte, Darwin,\r\na few technical terms. Few are those who know deeply what they talk\r\nabout, or those who do not try to make a show and parade of their\r\nmanner of speaking, which has no other merit than that of being a\r\nconceit in syllables.’ (Charles Morice naturally is responsible for\r\nthis last unmeaning phrase, not I.)\r\n\r\nThe original guests of the François I. made their appearance at one\r\no’clock in the day at their café, and remained there till dinner-time.\r\nImmediately after that meal they returned, and did not leave their\r\nheadquarters till long after midnight. Of course none of the Symbolists\r\nhad any known occupation. These ‘degenerates’ are no more capable of\r\nregularly fulfilling any duty than they are of methodical learning.\r\nIf this organic deficiency appears in a man of the lower classes, he\r\nbecomes a vagabond; in a woman of that class it leads to prostitution;\r\nin one belonging to the upper classes it takes the form of artistic and\r\nliterary drivel. The German popular mind betrays a deep intuition of\r\nthe true connection of things in inventing such a word as ‘day-thief’\r\n(_Tagedieb_) for such æsthetic loafers. Professional thieving and the\r\nunconquerable propensity to busy, gossiping, officious idleness flow\r\nfrom the same source, to wit, inborn weakness of brain.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the boon companions of the café are not conscious of\r\ntheir mentally-crippled condition. They find pet names and graceful\r\nappellations for their inability to submit themselves to any sort of\r\ndiscipline, and to devote persistent concentration and attention to\r\nany sort of work. They call it ‘the artist nature,’ ‘genius roaming\r\nat large,’ ‘a soaring above the low miasma of the commonplace.’ They\r\nridicule the dull Philistine, who, like the horse turning a winch,\r\nperforms mechanically a regular amount of work; they despise the\r\nnarrow-minded loons who demand that a man should either pursue a\r\ncircumscribed bourgeois trade or possess an officially acknowledged\r\nstatus, and who profoundly distrust impecuniary professions. They\r\nglory in roving folk who wander about singing and carelessly begging,\r\nand they hold up as their ideal the ‘commoner of air,’ who bathes in\r\nmorning dew, sleeps under flowers, and gets his clothing from the same\r\nfirm as the lilies of the field in the Gospel. Richepin’s _La Chanson\r\ndes Gueux_ is the most typical expression of this theory of life.\r\nBaumbach’s _Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen_ and _Spielmannslieder_\r\nare analogous specimens in German literature, but of a less pronounced\r\ncharacter. Schiller’s _Pegasus im Joch_ seems to be pulling at the\r\nsame rope as these haters of the work society expects of them, but\r\nit is only apparently so. Our great poet sides not with the impotent\r\nsluggard, but with that overflowing energy which would fain do greater\r\nthings than the work of an office-boy or a night-watchman.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the pseudo-artistic loafer, in spite of his imbecility\r\nand self-esteem, cannot fail to perceive that his mode of life\r\nruns contrary to the laws on which the structure of society and\r\ncivilization are based, and he feels the need of justifying himself\r\nin his own eyes. This he does by investing with a high significance\r\nthe dreams and chatter over which he wastes his time, calculated to\r\narouse in him the illusion that they rival in value the most serious\r\nproductions. ‘The fact is, you see,’ says M. Stéphane Mallarmé, ‘that\r\na fine book is the end for which the world was made.’[106] Morice\r\ncomplains[107] touchingly that the poetic mind ‘should be bound to\r\nsuffer the interruption of a twenty-eight days’ army drill between\r\nthe two halves of a verse.’ ‘The excitement of the streets,’ he goes\r\non, ‘the jarring of the Governmental engine, the newspapers, the\r\nelections, the change of the Ministry, have never made so much noise;\r\nthe stormy and turbulent autocracy of trade has suppressed the love of\r\nthe beautiful in the thoughts of the multitude, and industry has killed\r\nas much silence as politics might still have permitted to survive.’ In\r\nfact, what are all these nothings--commerce, manufactures, politics,\r\nadministration--against the immense importance of a hemistich?\r\n\r\nThe drivelling of the Symbolists was not entirely lost in the\r\natmosphere of their café, like the smoke of their pipes and\r\ncigarettes. A certain amount of it was perpetuated, and appeared\r\nin the _Revue Indépendante_, the _Revue Contemporaine_, and other\r\nfugitive periodicals, which served as organs to the round table of\r\nthe François I. These little journals and the books published by the\r\nSymbolists were not at first noticed outside the café. Then it happened\r\nthat _chroniqueurs_ of the Boulevard papers, into whose hands these\r\nwritings chanced to fall, devoted an article to them on days when\r\n‘copy’ was scanty, but only to hold them up to ridicule. That was all\r\nthe Symbolists wanted. Mockery or praise mattered little so long as\r\nthey got noticed. Now they were in the saddle, and showed at once what\r\nunparalleled circus-riders they were. They themselves used every effort\r\nto get into the larger newspapers, and when one of them succeeded, like\r\nthe smith of Jüterbock in the familiar fairy tale, in throwing his\r\ncap into an editor’s office through the crack of the door incautiously\r\nput ajar, he followed it neck and crop, took possession of the place,\r\nand in the twinkling of an eye transformed it into the citadel of the\r\nSymbolist party. In these tactics everything served their turn--the\r\ndried-up scepticism and apathy of Parisian editors, who take nothing\r\nseriously, are capable neither of enthusiasm nor of repugnance, and\r\nonly know the cardinal principle of their business, viz., to make\r\na noise, to arouse curiosity, to forestall others by bringing out\r\nsomething new and sensational; the uncritical gaping attitude of the\r\npublic, who repeat in faith all that their newspaper gossips to them\r\nwith an air of importance; the cowardice and cupboard-love of the\r\ncritics who, finding themselves confronted by a closed and numerous\r\nband of reckless young men, got nervous at the sight of their clenched\r\nfists and angry threatening glances, and did not dare to quarrel\r\nwith them; the low cunning of the ambitious, who hoped to make a\r\ngood bargain if they speculated on the rise of shares in Symbolism.\r\nThus the very worst and most despicable characteristics of editors,\r\ncritics, aspiring authors, and newspaper readers, co-operated to make\r\nknown, and, in part, even famous, the names of the original habitués\r\nof the François I., and to awaken the conviction in very many weak\r\nminds of both hemispheres that their tendency governed the literature\r\nof the day, and included all the germs of the future. This triumph of\r\nthe Symbolists marks the victory of the gang over the individual. It\r\nproves the superiority of attack over defence, and the efficacy of\r\nmutual-admiration-insurance, even in the case of the most beggarly\r\nincapacity.\r\n\r\nWith all their differences, the works of the Symbolists have two\r\nfeatures in common. They are vague often to the point of being\r\nunintelligible, and they are pious. Their vagueness is only to be\r\nexpected, after all that has been said here about the peculiarities of\r\nmystic thought. Their piousness has attained to an importance which\r\nmakes it necessary to consider it more in detail.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the last few years, a large number of mysteries, passion\r\nplays, golden legends, and cantatas appeared, when one dozen after\r\nanother of new poets and authors, in their first poems, novels, and\r\ntreatises, made ardent confessions of faith, invoked the Virgin Mary,\r\nspoke with rapture of the sacrifice of the Mass, and knelt in fervent\r\nprayer, the cry arose amongst reactionists, who have a vested interest\r\nin diffusing a belief in a reversion of cultured humanity to the mental\r\ndarkness of the past: ‘Behold, the youth, the hope, the future of the\r\nFrench people is turning away from science; “emancipation” is becoming\r\nbankrupt; souls are opening again to religion, and the Holy Catholic\r\nChurch steps anew into its lofty office, as the teacher, comforter,\r\nand guide of civilized mankind.’ The Symbolistic tendency is designedly\r\ncalled ‘neo-Catholic,’ and certain critics pointed to its appearance\r\nand success as a proof that freethought was overthrown by faith. ‘Even\r\nthe most superficial glance at the state of the world,’ writes Edouard\r\nRod,[108] ‘shows us that we are on all sides in the full swing of\r\nreaction.’ And, further, ‘I believe in reaction in every sense of the\r\nword. How far this reaction will go is the secret of to-morrow.’\r\n\r\nThe jubilant heralds of the new reaction, in inquiring into the cause\r\nof this movement, find, with remarkable unanimity, this answer, viz.:\r\nThe best and most cultivated minds return to faith, because they found\r\nout that science had deceived them, and not done for them what it\r\nhad promised to do. ‘The man of this century,’ says M. Melchior de\r\nVogüé,[109] ‘has acquired a very excusable confidence in himself....\r\nThe rational mechanism of the world has been revealed to him.... In\r\nthe explanation of things the Divine order is wholly eliminated....\r\nBesides, why follow after doubtful causes, when the operations of the\r\nuniverse and of humanity had become so clear to the physicist and\r\nphysiologist?... The least wrong God ever wrought was that of being\r\nunnecessary. Great minds assured us of this, and all mediocre spirits\r\nwere convinced of it. The eighteenth century had inaugurated the\r\nworship of Reason. The rapture of that millennium lasted but a moment.\r\nThen came eternal disillusion, the regularly recurring ruin of all that\r\nman had built upon the hollow basis of his reason.... He had to admit\r\nthat, beyond the circle of acquired truths, the abyss of ignorance\r\nappeared again just as deep, just as disquieting.’\r\n\r\nCharles Morice, the theorist and philosopher of the Symbolists,\r\narraigns Science on almost every page of his book, _La Littérature de\r\ntout-à-l’heure_, for her great and divers sins. ‘It is lamentable,’ he\r\nsays in his apocalyptic phraseology,[110] ‘that our learned men have\r\nno idea how, in popularizing science, they were disorganizing it (?).\r\nTo entrust principles to inferior memories, is to expose them to the\r\nuncertainty of unauthorized interpretations, of erroneous commentaries\r\nand heterodox hypotheses. For the word that the books contain is a\r\ndead letter, and the books themselves may perish, but the impact which\r\nthey leave behind them, the breath going forth from them, survives.\r\nAnd what if they have breathed out storm and unloosed (!) darkness?\r\nBut this is just what all this chaos of vulgarization has as its most\r\npatent result.... Is not such the natural consequence of a century\r\nof psychological investigation, which was a good training for the\r\nreason, but whose immediate and actual consequences must inevitably\r\nbe weariness, and disgust, ay, and despair of reason?... Science had\r\nerased the word mystery. With the same stroke of the pen she had\r\nexpunged the words beauty, truth, joy, humanity.... And now mysticism\r\ntakes from Science, the intruder and usurper, not only all that she\r\nhad stolen, but something also, it may be, of her own property. The\r\nreaction against the shameless and miserable negations of scientific\r\nliterature ... has taken the form of an unforeseen poetical restoration\r\nof Catholicism.’\r\n\r\nAnother graphomaniac, the author of that imbecile book, _Rembrandt\r\nas Educator_, drivels in almost the same way. ‘Interest in science,\r\nand especially in the once so popular natural science, has widely\r\ndiminished of late in the German world.... There has been to a certain\r\nextent a surfeit of induction; there is a longing for synthesis; the\r\ndays of objectivity are declining once more to their end, and, in its\r\nplace, subjectivity knocks at the door.’[111]\r\n\r\nEdouard Rod[112] says: ‘The century has advanced without keeping all\r\nits promises’; and further on he speaks again of ‘this ageing and\r\ndeluded century.’\r\n\r\nIn a small book, which has become a sort of gospel to imbeciles and\r\nidiots, _Le Devoir présent_, the author, M. Paul Desjardins,[113] makes\r\ncontinual attacks on ‘so-called scientific empiricism,’ and speaks of\r\nthe ‘negativists, the empiricists, and the mechanists, whose attention\r\nis wholly taken up with physical and inexorable forces,’ boasting of\r\nhis intention ‘to render invalid the value of the empirical methods.’\r\n\r\nEven a serious thinker, M. F. Paulhan,[114] in his investigation of the\r\nbasis of French neo-mysticism, comes to the conclusion that natural\r\nscience has shown itself powerless to satisfy the needs of mankind.\r\n‘We feel ourselves surrounded by a vast unknown, and demand that at\r\nleast access to it should be permitted to us. Evolution and positivism\r\nhave blocked the way.... For these reasons evolution could not but\r\nshow itself incapable of guiding the mind, even if it left us great\r\nthoughts.’\r\n\r\nOverwhelming as may appear this unanimity between strong minds\r\ncommanding respect and weak graphomaniacs, it does not, nevertheless,\r\ncontain the slightest spark of truth. To assert that the world turns\r\naway from science because the ‘empirical,’ which means the scientific,\r\nmethod of observation and registration has suffered shipwreck, is\r\neither a conscious lie or shows lack of mental responsibility. A\r\nhealthy-minded and honourable man must almost feel ashamed to have\r\nstill to demonstrate this. In the last ten years, by means of\r\nspectrum-analysis, science has made disclosures in the constitution\r\nof the most distant heavenly bodies, their component matter, their\r\ndegree of heat, the speed and direction of their motions; it has\r\nfirmly established the essential unity of all modes of force, and\r\nhas made highly probable the unity of all matter; it is on the track\r\nof the formation and development of chemical elements, and it has\r\nlearnt to understand the building up of extremely intricate organic\r\ncombinations; it shows us the relations of atoms in molecules, and\r\nthe position of molecules in space; it has thrown wonderful light on\r\nthe conditions of the action of electricity, and placed this force at\r\nthe service of mankind; it has renewed geology and palæontology, and\r\ndisentangled the concatenation of animal and vegetable forms of life;\r\nit has newly created biology and embryology, and has explained in a\r\nsurprising manner, through the discovery and investigation of germs,\r\nsome of the most disquieting mysteries of perpetual metamorphosis,\r\nillness, and death; it has found or perfected methods which, like\r\nchronography, instantaneous photography, etc., permit of the analysis\r\nand registration of the most fleeting phenomena, not immediately\r\napprehensible by human sense, and which promise to become extremely\r\nfruitful for the knowledge of nature. And in the face of such splendid,\r\nsuch overwhelmingly grand results, the enumeration of which could\r\neasily be doubled and trebled, does anyone dare to speak of the\r\nshipwreck of science, and of the incapacity of the empirical method?\r\n\r\nScience is said not to have kept what she promised. When has she\r\never promised anything else than honest and attentive observation of\r\nphenomena and, if possible, establishment of the conditions under which\r\nthey occur? And has she not kept this promise? Does she not keep it\r\nperpetually? If anyone has expected of her that she would explain from\r\none day to another the whole mechanism of the universe, like a juggler\r\nexplains his apparent magic, he has indeed no idea of the true mission\r\nof science. She denies herself all leaps and flights. She advances step\r\nby step. She builds slowly and patiently a firm bridge out into the\r\nUnknown, and can throw no new arch over the abyss before she has sunk\r\ndeep the foundations of a new pier in the depths, and raised it to the\r\nright height.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, she asks nothing at all about the first cause of phenomena,\r\nso long as she has so many more proximate causes to investigate. Many\r\nof the most eminent men of science go so far, indeed, as to assert\r\nthat the first cause will never become the object of scientific\r\ninvestigation, and call it, with Herbert Spencer, ‘the Unknowable,’\r\nor exclaim despondingly with Du Bois-Reymond, _Ignorabimus_. Both of\r\nthem in this respect are completely unscientific, and only prove\r\nthat even clear thinkers like Spencer, and sober investigators like\r\nDu Bois-Reymond, stand yet under the influence of theological dreams.\r\nScience can speak of no Unknowable, since this would presuppose that\r\nshe is able to mark exactly the boundaries of the Knowable. This,\r\nhowever, she cannot do, since every new discovery thrusts back that\r\nboundary. Moreover, the acceptance of an Unknowable involves the\r\nacknowledgment that there is something which we cannot know. Now, in\r\norder to be able seriously to assert the existence of this Something,\r\neither we must have acquired some knowledge of it, however slight\r\nand indistinct, and this, therefore, would prove that it cannot be\r\nunknowable, since we actually know it, and nothing then would justify\r\nus in declaring beforehand that our present knowledge of it, however\r\nlittle it may be, will not be extended and deepened; or else we have\r\nno knowledge, even of the minutest character, of the philosopher’s\r\nUnknowable, in which case it cannot exist for us. The whole conception\r\nis based upon nothing, and the word is an idle creation of a dreaming\r\nimagination. The same thing can be said of _Ignorabimus_. It is the\r\nopposite of science. It is not a correct inference from well-founded\r\npremises, it is not the result of observation, but a mystical prophecy.\r\nNo one has the right to make communications with respect to the future\r\nas matters of fact. Science can announce what she knows to-day; she can\r\nalso mark off exactly what she does not know; but to say what she will\r\nor will not at any time know is not her office.\r\n\r\nIt is true that whoever asks from Science that she should give an\r\nanswer to all the questions of idle and restless minds with unshaken\r\nand audacious certainty must be disappointed by her; for she will\r\nnot, and cannot, fulfil his desires. Theology and metaphysics have an\r\neasier task. They devise some fable, and propound it with overwhelming\r\nearnestness. If anyone does not believe in them, they threaten and\r\ninsult the intractable client; but they can prove nothing to him,\r\nthey cannot force him to take their chimeras for cash. Theology and\r\nmetaphysics can never be brought into a dilemma. It costs them nothing\r\nto add to their words more words, to unite to one voluntary assertion\r\nanother, and pile up dogma upon dogma. It will never occur to the\r\nserious sound mind, which thirsts after real knowledge, to seek it from\r\nmetaphysics or theology. They appeal only to childish brains, whose\r\ndesire for knowledge, or, rather, whose curiosity, is fully satisfied\r\nwith the cradling croon of an old wife’s tale.\r\n\r\nScience does not compete with theology and metaphysics. If the\r\nlatter declare themselves able to explain the whole phenomenon of\r\nthe universe, Science shows that these pretended explanations are\r\nempty chatter. She, for her part, is naturally on her guard against\r\nputting in the place of a proved absurdity another absurdity. She says\r\nmodestly: ‘Here we have a fact, here an assumption, here a conjecture.\r\n‘Tis a rogue who gives more than he has.’ If this does not satisfy\r\nthe neo-Catholics, they should sit down and themselves investigate,\r\nthemselves find out new facts, and help to make clear the weird\r\nobscurity of the phenomenon of the universe. That would be a proof of\r\na true desire for knowledge. At the table of Science there is room for\r\nall, and every fellow-observer is welcome. But this does not enter\r\ninto even the dreams of these poor creatures, who drivel about the\r\n‘bankruptcy of science.’ Talk is so much easier and more comfortable\r\nthan inquiry and discovery!\r\n\r\nTrue, science tells us nothing about the life after death, of\r\nharp-concerts in Paradise, and of the transformation of stupid youths\r\nand hysterical geese into white-clad angels with rainbow-coloured\r\nwings. It contents itself, in a much more plain and prosaic manner,\r\nwith alleviating the existence of mankind on earth. It lessens the\r\naverage of mortality, and lengthens the life of the individual through\r\nthe suppression of known causes of disease; it invents new comforts,\r\nand makes easier the struggle against Nature’s destructive powers. The\r\nSymbolist, who is preserved after surgical interference through asepsy\r\nfrom suppuration, mortification, and death; who protects himself by\r\na Chamberland filter from typhus; who by the careless turning of a\r\nbutton fills his room with electric light; who through a telephone can\r\nconverse with someone beloved in far-distant countries, has to thank\r\nthis alleged bankrupt science for it all, and not the theology to which\r\nhe maintains that he wants to return.\r\n\r\nThe demand that science should give not only true, if limited,\r\nconclusions, and offer not only tangible benefits, but also solve all\r\nenigmas to-day and at once, and make all men omniscient, happy, and\r\ngood, is ridiculous. Theology and metaphysics have never fulfilled this\r\ndemand. It is simply the intellectual manifestation of the same foolish\r\nconceit, which in material concerns reveals itself in hankering after\r\npleasure and in shirking work. The man who has lost his social status,\r\nwho craves for wine and women, for idleness and honours, and complains\r\nof the constitution of society because it offers no satisfaction to his\r\nlusts, is own brother to the Symbolist who demands truth, and reviles\r\nscience because it does not hand it to him on a golden platter. Both\r\nbetray a similar incapacity to grasp the reality of things, and to\r\nunderstand that it is not possible to acquire goods without bodily\r\nlabour, or truth without mental exertion. The capable man who wrests\r\nher gifts from Nature, the industrious inquirer who in the sweat of his\r\nbrow bores into the sources of knowledge, inspires respect and cordial\r\nsympathy. On the other hand, there can be but little esteem for the\r\ndiscontented idlers who look for riches from a lucky lottery ticket, or\r\na rich uncle, and for enlightenment from a revelation which is to come\r\nto them without trouble on their part over the slovenly beer-drinking\r\nat their favourite café.\r\n\r\nThe dunces who abuse science, reproach it also for having destroyed\r\nideals, and stolen from life all its worth. This accusation is just as\r\nabsurd as the talk about the bankruptcy of science. A higher ideal than\r\nthe increase of general knowledge there cannot be. What saintly legend\r\nis as beautiful as the life of an inquirer, who spends his existence\r\nbending over a microscope, almost without bodily wants, known and\r\nhonoured by few, working only for his own conscience’ sake, without\r\nany other ambition than that perhaps one little new fact may be firmly\r\nestablished, which a more fortunate successor will make use of in a\r\nbrilliant synthesis, and insert as a stone in some monument of natural\r\nscience? What religious fable has inspired with a contempt of death\r\nsublimer martyrs than a Gehlen, who sank down poisoned while preparing\r\nthe arsenious hydrogen which he had discovered; or a Crocé-Spinelli,\r\nwho was overtaken by death in an over-rapid ascent of his balloon while\r\nobserving the pressure of the atmosphere; or an Ehrenberg, who became\r\nblind over his life’s work; or a Hyrtl, who almost entirely destroyed\r\nhis eyesight by his anatomical corrosive preparations; or the doctors,\r\nwho inoculate themselves with some deadly disease--not to speak of the\r\ninnumerable crowd of discoverers travelling to the North Pole, and\r\nto the interior of dark continents? And did Archimedes really feel\r\nhis life to be so worthless when he entreated the pillaging bands of\r\nMarcellus, ‘Do not disturb my circles’? Genuine healthy poetry has\r\nalways recognised this, and finds its most ideal characters, not in\r\na devotee, who murmurs prayers with drivelling lips, and stares with\r\ndistorted eyes at some visual hallucination, but in a Prometheus and a\r\nFaust, who wrestle for science, _i.e._, for exact knowledge of nature.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that science has not kept its promises, and that,\r\ntherefore, the rising generation is turning away from it, does not\r\nfor a moment resist criticism, and is entirely without foundation.\r\nIt is a senseless premise of neo-Catholicism, were the Symbolists to\r\ndeclare a hundred times over that disgust with science had made them\r\nmystics. The explanations which even a healthy-minded man makes with\r\nrespect to the true motives of his actions are only to be accepted\r\nwith the most cautious criticism; those proffered by the degenerate\r\nare completely useless. For the impulse to act and to think originate,\r\nfor the degenerate, in the unconscious, and consciousness finds\r\nsubsequent, and in some measure plausible, reasons for the thoughts and\r\ndeeds, the real source of which is unknown to itself. Every book on\r\nsuggestion gives illustrations of Charcot’s typical case: a hysterical\r\nfemale is sent into hypnotic sleep, and it is suggested to her that\r\non awaking she is to stab one of the doctors present. She is then\r\nawakened. She grasps a knife and makes for her appointed victim. The\r\nblade is wrenched from her, and she is asked why she wishes to murder\r\nthe doctor. She answers without hesitation, ‘Because he has done me an\r\ninjury.’ Note that she had seen him that day for the first time in her\r\nlife. This person felt when in a waking condition the impulse to kill\r\nthe doctor. Her consciousness had no presentiment that this impulse had\r\nbeen suggested to her in a hypnotic state. Consciousness knows that a\r\nmurder is never committed without some motive. Forced to find a motive\r\nfor the attempted murder, consciousness falls back upon the only one\r\nreasonably possible under the circumstances, and fancies that it got\r\nhold of the idea of murder in order to avenge some wrong.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Janet[115] offer, as an explanation of this psychological\r\nphenomenon, the hypothesis of dual personality. ‘Every person consists\r\nof two personalities, one conscious and one unconscious. Among\r\nhealthy persons both are alike complete, and both in equilibrium. In\r\nthe hysteric they are unequal, and out of equilibrium. One of the\r\ntwo personalities, usually the conscious, is incomplete, the other\r\nremaining perfect.’ The conscious personality has the thankless task\r\nof inventing reasons for the actions of the unconscious. It resembles\r\nthe familiar game where one person makes movements and another\r\nsays words in keeping with them. In the degenerate with disturbed\r\nequilibrium consciousness has to play the part of an ape-like mother\r\nfinding excuses for the stupid and naughty tricks of a spoiled child.\r\nThe unconscious personality commits follies and evil deeds, and the\r\nconscious, standing powerless by, and unable to hinder it, seeks to\r\npalliate them by all sorts of pretexts.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the neo-Catholic movement, then, is not to be sought in\r\nany objection felt by younger minds to science, or in their having\r\nany complaint to make against it. A De Vogüé, a Rod, a Desjardins, a\r\nPaulhan, who impute such a basis to the mysticism of the Symbolists,\r\narbitrarily attribute to it an origin which it never had. It is\r\ndue solely and alone to the degenerate condition of its inventors.\r\nNeo-Catholicism is rooted in emotivity and mysticism, both of these\r\nbeing the most frequent and most distinctive stigmata of the degenerate.\r\n\r\nThat the mysticism of the degenerate, even in France, the land of\r\nVoltaire, has frequently taken the form of religious enthusiasm might\r\nat first seem strange, but will be understood if we consider the\r\npolitical and social circumstances of the French people during the last\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\nThe great Revolution proclaimed three ideals: Liberty, Equality, and\r\nFraternity. Fraternity is a harmless word which has no real meaning,\r\nand therefore disturbs nobody. Liberty, to the upper classes, is\r\ncertainly unpleasant, and they lament greatly over the sovereignty of\r\nthe people and universal suffrage, but still they bear, without too\r\nmuch complaint, a state of things which, after all, is sufficiently\r\nmitigated by a prying administration, police supervision, militarism,\r\nand gendarmerie, and which will always be sufficient to keep the mob\r\nin leash. But equality to those in possession is an insufferable\r\nabomination. It is the one thing won by the great Revolution, which has\r\noutlasted all subsequent changes in the form of government, and has\r\nremained alive in the French people. The Frenchman does not know much\r\nabout fraternity; his liberty in many ways has a muzzle as its emblem;\r\nbut his equality he possesses as a matter of fact, and to it he holds\r\nfirmly. The lowest vagabond, the bully of the capital, the rag-picker,\r\nthe hostler, believes that he is quite as good as the duke, and says\r\nso to his face without the smallest hesitation if occasion arises. The\r\nreasons of the Frenchman’s fanaticism for equality are not particularly\r\nelevated. The feeling does not spring from a proud, manly consciousness\r\nand the knowledge of his own worth, but from low envy and malicious\r\nintolerance. There shall be nothing above the dead level! There shall\r\nbe nothing better, nothing more beautiful or even more striking, than\r\nthe average vulgarity! The upper classes struggle against this rage for\r\nequalization with passionate vehemence, especially and precisely those\r\nwho have reached their high position through the great Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe grandchildren of the rural serfs, who plundered and destroyed the\r\ncountry seats of noblemen, basely murdered the inmates, and seized upon\r\ntheir lands; the descendants of town grocers and cobblers, who waxed\r\nrich as politicians of street and club, as speculators in national\r\nproperty and assignats, and as swindlers in army purveyance, do not\r\nwant to become identified with the mob. They want to form a privileged\r\nclass. They want to be recognised as belonging to a more honourable\r\ncaste. They sought, for this purpose, a distinguishing mark, which\r\nwould make them at once conspicuous as members of a select class, and\r\nthey found it in belonging to the Church.\r\n\r\nThis choice is quite intelligible. The mass of the people in France,\r\nespecially in towns, is sceptical, and the aristocracy of the _ancien\r\nrégime_, who in the eighteenth century bragged about free thought, had\r\ncome out of the deluge of 1789 as very pious persons, comprehending\r\nor divining the inner connection between all the old ideas and emblems\r\nof the Faith, of the Monarchy, and of feudal nobility. Hence, through\r\ntheir clericalism, the parvenus at once established a contrast between\r\nthemselves and the multitude from whom they wanted to keep distinct,\r\nand a resemblance with the class into which they would like to smuggle\r\nor thrust themselves.\r\n\r\nExperience teaches that the instinct of preservation is often the\r\nworst adviser in positions of danger. The man who cannot swim,\r\nfalling into the water, involuntarily throws up his arms, and thus\r\ninfallibly lets his head be submerged and himself be drowned; whereas\r\nhis mouth and nose would remain above water if he held his arms and\r\nhands quietly under the surface. The bad rider, who feels his seat\r\ninsecure, usually draws up his legs, and then comes the certainty of\r\na fall; whereas he would probably be able to preserve his equilibrium\r\nif he left his legs outstretched. Thus the French _bourgeoisie_, who\r\nknew that they had snatched for themselves the fruits of the great\r\nupheaval, and let the Fourth Estate, who alone had made the Revolution,\r\ncome out of it empty-handed, chose the worst means for retaining\r\ntheir unjustly-acquired possessions and privileges, and for escaping\r\nunnatural equalization when they made use of their clericalism for the\r\nestablishment of their social status. They alienated, in consequence,\r\nthe wisest, strongest, and most cultivated minds, and drove over to\r\nsocialism many young men who, though intellectually radical, were yet\r\neconomically conservative, and little in favour of equality, and who\r\nwould have become a strong defence for a free-thinking _bourgeoisie_,\r\nbut who felt that socialism, however radical its economic doctrines and\r\nimpossible its theories of equality, represented emancipation.\r\n\r\nBut I have not to judge here whether the religious mimicry of the\r\nFrench _bourgeoisie_, which was to make them resemble the old nobility,\r\nexerts the protection expected of it or not; I only set down the fact\r\nof this mimicry. It is a necessary consequence that all the rich\r\nand snobbish parvenus send their sons to the Jesuit middle and high\r\nschools. To be educated by the Jesuits is regarded as a sign of caste,\r\nvery much as is membership of the Jockey Club. The old pupils of the\r\nJesuits form a ‘black freemasonry,’ which zealously advances their\r\nprotégés in every career, marries them to heiresses, hurries to their\r\nassistance in misfortune, hushes up their sins, stifles scandal, etc.\r\nIt is the Jesuits who for the last decade have made it their care to\r\ninculcate their own habits of thinking into the rich and high-born\r\nyouth of France entrusted to them. These youths brought brains of\r\nhereditary deficiency, and therefore mystically disposed, into the\r\nclerical schools, and these then gave to the mystic thoughts of the\r\ndegenerate pupils a religious content. This is not an arbitrary\r\nassumption, but a well-founded fact. Charles Morice, the æsthetic\r\ntheorist and philosopher of the Symbolists, received his education from\r\nthe Jesuits, according to the testimony of his friends.[116] So did\r\nLouis le Cardonnel, Henri de Régnier, and others. The Jesuits invented\r\nthe phrase ‘bankruptcy of science,’ and their pupils repeat it after\r\nthem, because it includes a plausible explanation of their pietistic\r\nmooning, the real organic causes of which are unknown to them, and for\r\nthat matter would not be understood if they were known. ‘I return to\r\nfaith, because science does not satisfy me,’ is a possible statement.\r\nIt is even a superior thing to say, since it presupposes a thirst for\r\ntruth and a noble interest in great questions. On the contrary, a man\r\nwill hardly be willing to confess, ‘I am an enthusiastic admirer of the\r\nTrinity and the Holy Virgin because I am degenerate, and my brain is\r\nincapable of attention and clear thought.’\r\n\r\nThat the Jesuitical argument as reported by MM. de Vogüé, Rod,\r\netc., can have found credit beyond clerical circles and degenerate\r\nyouth, that the half-educated are heard repeating to-day, ‘Science\r\nis conquered, the future belongs to religion,’ is consistent with\r\nthe mental peculiarities of the million. They never have recourse to\r\nfacts, but repeat the ready-made propositions with which they have been\r\nprompted. If they would have regard to facts, they would know that\r\nthe number of faculties, teachers and students of natural science, of\r\nscientific periodicals and books, of their subscribers and readers,\r\nof laboratories, scientific societies and reports to the academies\r\nincreases year by year. It can be shown by figures that science does\r\nnot lose, but continually gains ground.[117] But the million does not\r\ncare about exact statistics. In France it accepts without resistance\r\nthe suggestion, that science is retreating before religion, from a few\r\nnewspapers, written mainly for clubmen and gilded courtezans, into\r\nthe columns of which the pupils of the clerical schools have found an\r\nentrance. Of science itself, of its hypotheses, methods, and results,\r\nthey have never known anything. Science was at one time the fashion.\r\nThe daily press of that date said, ‘We live in a scientific age’; the\r\nnews of the day reported the travels and marriages of scientists; the\r\nfeuilleton-novels contained witty allusions to Darwin; the inventors of\r\nelegant walking-sticks and perfumes called their productions ‘Evolution\r\nEssence’ or ‘Selection Canes’; those who affected culture took\r\nthemselves seriously for the pioneers of progress and enlightenment.\r\nTo-day those social circles which set the fashions, and the papers\r\nwhich seek to please these circles, decree that, not science is\r\n_chic_, but faith, and now the paragraphs of the boulevard papers\r\nrelate small piquant sayings of preachers; in the feuilleton-novels\r\nthere are quotations from the _Imitation of Christ_; inventors bring\r\nout richly-mounted prie-dieus and choice rosaries, and the Philistine\r\nfeels with deep emotion the miraculous flower of faith springing up and\r\nblossoming in his heart. Of real disciples science has scarcely lost\r\none. It is only natural, on the contrary, that the plebs of the salons,\r\nto whom it has never been more than a fashion, should turn their backs\r\non it at the mere command of a tailor or a modiste.\r\n\r\nThus much on the neo-Catholicism which, partly for party reasons,\r\npartly from ignorance, partly from snobbishness, is mistaken for a\r\nserious intellectual movement of the times.\r\n\r\nThe pretension of Symbolism to be, not only a return to faith, but a\r\nnew theory of art and poetry, is what we must now proceed to test.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to know at the outset what Symbolists understand by symbol\r\nand symbolism, we shall meet with the same difficulties we encountered\r\nin determining the precise meaning of the name pre-Raphaelitism, and\r\nfor the same reason, viz., because the inventors of these appellations\r\nunderstood by them hundreds of different mutually contradictory,\r\nindefinite things, or simply nothing at all. A skilled and sagacious\r\njournalist, Jules Huret,[118] instituted an inquiry about the new\r\nliterary movement in France, and from its leading representatives\r\nacquired information, by which he has furnished us with a trustworthy\r\nknowledge of the meaning which they connect, or pretend to connect,\r\nwith the expressions and phraseology of their programme. I will here\r\nadduce some of these utterances and declarations. They will not tell us\r\nwhat Symbolism is. But they may afford us some insight into symbolist\r\nmethods of thought.\r\n\r\nM. Stéphane Mallarmé, whose leadership of the Symbolist band is least\r\ndisputed among the disciples, expresses himself as follows: ‘To name\r\nan object means to suppress three-quarters of the pleasure of a\r\npoem--_i.e._, of the happiness which consists in gradually divining\r\nit. Our dream should be to suggest the object. The symbol is the\r\nperfected use of this mystery, viz., to conjure up an object gradually\r\nin order to show the condition of a soul; or, conversely, to choose\r\nan object, and out of it to reveal a state of the soul by a series of\r\ninterpretations.’\r\n\r\nIf the reader does not at once understand this combination of vague\r\nwords, he need not stop to solve them. Later on I will translate the\r\nstammerings of this weak mind into the speech of sound men.\r\n\r\nM. Paul Verlaine, another high-priest of the sect, expresses himself\r\nas follows: ‘It was I who, in the year 1885, laid claim to the name\r\nof Symbolist. The Parnassians, and most of the romanticists, in a\r\ncertain sense lacked symbols.... Thence errors of local colouring in\r\nhistory, the shrinking up of the myth through false philosophical\r\ninterpretations, thought without the discernment of analogies, the\r\nanecdote emptied of feeling.’\r\n\r\nLet us listen to a few second-rate poets of the group. ‘I declare\r\nart,’ says M. Paul Adam, ‘to be the enshrining of a dogma in a symbol.\r\nIt is a means of making a system prevail, and of bringing truths to\r\nthe light of day.’ M. Rémy de Gourmont confesses honestly: ‘I cannot\r\nunveil the hidden meaning of the word “symbolism,” since I am neither\r\na theorist nor a magician.’ And M. Saint-Pol-Roux-le-Magnifique utters\r\nthis profound warning: ‘Let us take care! Symbolism carried to excess\r\nleads to _nombrilisme_, and to a morbid mechanism.... This symbolism is\r\nto some extent a parody of mysticism.... Pure symbolism is an anomaly\r\nin this remarkable century, remarkable for militant activities. Let us\r\nview this transitional art as a clever trick played upon naturalism,\r\nand as a precursor of the poetry of to-morrow.’\r\n\r\nWe may expect from the theorists and philosophers of the group more\r\nexhaustive information concerning their methods and aims. Accordingly,\r\nM. Charles Morice instructs us how ‘the symbol is the combination of\r\nthe objects which have aroused our sensations, with our souls, in a\r\nfiction [_fiction_]. The means is suggestion; it is a question of\r\ngiving people a remembrance of something which they have never seen.’\r\nAnd M. Gustav Kahn says: ‘For me personally, symbolic art consists\r\nin recording in a cycle of works, as completely as possible, the\r\nmodifications and variations of the mind of the poet, who is inspired\r\nby an aim which he has determined.’\r\n\r\nIn Germany there have already been found some imbeciles and idiots,\r\nsome victims of hysteria and graphomania, who affirm that they\r\nunderstand this twaddle, and who develop it further in lectures,\r\nnewspaper articles and books. The cultured German Philistine, who from\r\nof old has had preached to him contempt for ‘platitude,’ _i.e._, for\r\nhealthy common-sense, and admiration for ‘deep meaning,’ which is as a\r\nrule only the futile bubbling of soft and addled brains incapable of\r\nthought, becomes visibly uneasy, and begins to inquire if there may not\r\nreally be something behind these senseless series of words. In France\r\npeople have not been caught on the limed twigs of these poor fools\r\nand cold-blooded jesters, but have considered Symbolism to be what in\r\nfact it is, madness or humbug. We shall meet with these words in the\r\nwritings of noted representatives of all shades of literary thought.\r\n\r\n‘The Symbolists!’ exclaims M. Jules Lemaître, ‘there are none....\r\nThey themselves do not know what they are or what they want. There\r\nis something stirring and heaving under the earth, but unable to\r\nbreak through. Do you understand? When they have painfully produced\r\nsomething, they would like to build formulæ and theories around it, but\r\nfail in doing so, because they do not possess the necessary strength\r\nof mind.... They are jesters with a certain amount of sincerity--that\r\nI grant them--but nevertheless jesters.’ M. Joséphin Péladan describes\r\nthem as ‘whimsical pyrotechnists of metrics and glossaries, who combine\r\nin order to get on, and give themselves odd names in order to get\r\nknown.’ M. Jules Bois is much more forcible: ‘Disconnected action,\r\nconfused clamour, such are the Symbolists. Cacophony of savages\r\nwho have been turning over the leaves of an English grammar, or a\r\nglossary of obsolete words. If they have ever known anything, they\r\npretend to have forgotten it. Indistinct, faulty, obscure, they are\r\nnevertheless as solemn as augurs.... You, decadent Symbolists, you\r\ndeceive us with childish and necromantic formulæ.’ Verlaine himself,\r\nthe co-founder of Symbolism, in a moment of sincerity, calls his\r\nfollowers a ‘flat-footed horde, each with his own banner, on which is\r\ninscribed _Réclame_!’ M. Henri de Régnier says apologetically: ‘They\r\nfeel the need of gathering round a common flag, so that they may fight\r\nmore effectually against the contented.’ M. Zola speaks of them as ‘a\r\nswarm of sharks who, not being able to swallow us, devour each other.’\r\nM. Joseph Caraguel designates symbolical literature as ‘a literature\r\nof whining, of babbling, of empty brains, a literature of Sudanese\r\nGriots [minstrels].’ Edmond Haraucourt plainly discerns the aims of\r\nthe Symbolists: ‘They are discontented, and in a hurry. They are the\r\nBoulangists of literature. We must live! We would take a place in the\r\nworld, become notorious or notable. We beat wildly on a drum which is\r\nnot even a kettledrum.... Their true symbol is “Goods by express.”\r\nEveryone goes by express train. Their destination--Fame.’ M. Pierre\r\nQuillard thinks that under the title of Symbolists ‘poets of rare\r\ngifts and unmitigated simpletons have been arbitrarily included.’ And\r\nM. Gabriel Vicaire sees in the manifestoes of Symbolists ‘nothing but\r\nschoolboy jokes.’ Finally, M. Laurent Tailhade, one of the leading\r\nSymbolists, divulges the secret: ‘I have never attached any other value\r\nto this performance than that of a transient amusement. We took in\r\nthe credulous judgment of a few literary beginners with the joke of\r\ncoloured vowels, Theban love, Schopenhauerism, and other pranks, which\r\nhave since made their way in the world.’ Quite so; just, as we have\r\nalready said, in Germany.\r\n\r\nTo abuse, however, is not to explain, and although summary justice is\r\nfit in the case of deliberate swindlers, who, like quack-dentists, play\r\nthe savage in order to entice money from market-folk, yet anger and\r\nridicule are out of place in dealing with honest imbeciles. They are\r\ndiseased or crippled, and as such deserve only pity. Their infirmities\r\nmust be disclosed, but severity of treatment has been abolished even in\r\nlunatic asylums since Pinel’s time.\r\n\r\nThe Symbolists, so far as they are honestly degenerate and imbecile,\r\ncan think only in a mystical, _i.e._, in a confused way. The unknown\r\nis to them more powerful than the known; the activity of the organic\r\nnerves preponderates over that of the cerebral cortex; their emotions\r\noverrule their ideas. When persons of this kind have poetic and\r\nartistic instincts, they naturally want to give expression to their\r\nown mental state. They cannot make use of definite words of clear\r\nimport, for their own consciousness holds no clearly-defined univocal\r\nideas which could be embodied in such words. They choose, therefore,\r\nvague equivocal words, because these best conform to their ambiguous\r\nand equivocal ideas. The more indefinite, the more obscure a word is,\r\nso much the better does it suit the purpose of the imbecile, and it\r\nis notorious that among the insane this habit goes so far that, to\r\nexpress their ideas, which have become quite formless, they invent new\r\nwords, which are no longer merely obscure, but devoid of all meaning.\r\nWe have already seen that, for the typical degenerate, reality has\r\nno significance. On this point I will only remind the reader of the\r\npreviously cited utterances of D. G. Rossetti, Morice, etc. Clear\r\nspeech serves the purpose of communication of the actual. It has,\r\ntherefore, no value in the eyes of a degenerate subject. He prizes\r\nthat language alone which does not force him to follow the speaker\r\nattentively, but allows him to indulge without restraint in the\r\nmeanderings of his own reveries, just as his own language does not aim\r\nat the communication of definite thought, but is only intended to give\r\na pale reflection of the twilight of his own ideas. That is what M.\r\nMallarmé means when he says: ‘To name an object means to suppress three\r\nquarters of the pleasure.... Our dream should be to suggest the object.’\r\n\r\nMoreover, the thought of a healthy brain has a flow which is regulated\r\nby the laws of logic and the supervision of attention. It takes for its\r\ncontent a definite object, manipulates and exhausts it. The healthy man\r\ncan tell what he thinks, and his telling has a beginning and an end.\r\nThe mystic imbecile thinks merely according to the laws of association,\r\nand without the red thread of attention. He has fugitive ideation.\r\nHe can never state accurately what he is thinking about; he can only\r\ndenote the emotion which at the moment controls his consciousness. He\r\ncan only say in general, ‘I am sad,’ ‘I am merry,’ ‘I am fond,’ ‘I am\r\nafraid.’ His mind is filled with evanescent, floating, cloudy ideas,\r\nwhich take their hue from the reigning emotion, as the vapour hovering\r\nabove a crater flames red from the glow at the bottom of the volcanic\r\ncaldron. When he poetizes, therefore, he will never develop a logical\r\ntrain of thought, but will seek by means of obscure words of distinctly\r\nemotional colouring to represent a feeling, a mood. What he prizes in\r\npoetical works is not a clear narrative, the exposition of a definite\r\nthought, but only the reflected image of a mood, which awakens in him\r\na similar, but not necessarily the same, mood. The degenerate are well\r\naware of this difference between a work which expresses strong mental\r\nlabour and one in which merely emotionally coloured fugitive ideation\r\nebbs and flows; and they eagerly ask for a distinguishing name for\r\nthat kind of poetry of which alone they have any understanding. In\r\nFrance they have found this designation in the word ‘Symbolism.’ The\r\nexplanations which the Symbolists themselves give of their cognomen\r\nappear nonsensical; but the psychologist gathers clearly from their\r\nbabbling and stammering that under the name ‘symbol’ they understand a\r\nword (or series of words) expressing, not a fact of the external world,\r\nor of conscious thought, but an ambiguous glimmer of an idea, which\r\ndoes not force the reader to think, but allows him to dream, and hence\r\nbrings about no intellectual processes, but only moods.\r\n\r\nThe great poet of the Symbolists, their most admired model, from\r\nwhom, according to their unanimous testimony, they have received\r\nthe strongest inspiration, is Paul Verlaine. In this man we find,\r\nin astonishing completeness, all the physical and mental marks of\r\ndegeneration, and no author known to me answers so exactly, trait\r\nfor trait, to the descriptions of the degenerate given by the\r\nclinicists--his personal appearance, the history of his life, his\r\nintellect, his world of ideas and modes of expression. M. Jules\r\nHuret[119] gives the following account of Verlaine’s physical\r\nappearance: ‘His face, like that of a wicked angel grown old, with\r\na thin, untrimmed beard, and abrupt(?) nose; his bushy, bristling\r\neyebrows, resembling bearded wheat, hiding deep-set green eyes; his\r\nwholly bald and huge long skull, misshapen by enigmatic bumps--all\r\nthese give to his physiognomy a contradictory appearance of stubborn\r\nasceticism and cyclopean appetites.’ As appears in these ludicrously\r\nlaboured and, in part, entirely senseless expressions, even the most\r\nunscientific observer has been struck with what Huret calls his\r\n‘enigmatic bumps.’ If we look at the portrait of the poet, by Eugène\r\nCarrière, of which a photograph serves as frontispiece in the _Select\r\nPoems_ of Verlaine,[120] and still more at that by M. Aman-Jean,\r\nexhibited in the Champs de Mars Salon in 1892, we instantly remark the\r\ngreat asymmetry of the head, which Lombroso[121] has pointed out among\r\ndegenerates, and the Mongolian physiognomy indicated by the projecting\r\ncheek-bones, obliquely placed eyes, and thin beard, which the same\r\ninvestigator[122] looks upon as signs of degeneration.\r\n\r\nVerlaine’s life is enveloped in mystery, but it is known, from his own\r\navowals, that he passed two years in prison. In the poem _Écrit en_\r\n1875[123] he narrates in detail, not only without the least shame,\r\nbut with gay unconcern, nay, even with boasting, that he was a true\r\nprofessional criminal:\r\n\r\n  ‘J’ai naguère habité le meilleur des châteaux\r\n  Dans le plus fin pays d’eau vive et de coteaux:\r\n  Quatre tours s’élevaient sur le front d’autant d’ailes,\r\n  Et j’ai longtemps, longtemps habité l’une d’elles...\r\n  Une chambre bien close, une table, une chaise,\r\n  Un lit strict où l’on pût dormir juste à son aise,...\r\n  Tel fut mon lot durant les longs mois là passés...\r\n  ...J’étais heureux avec ma vie,\r\n  Reconnaissant de biens que nul, certes, n’envie.’\r\n\r\nAnd in the poem _Un Conte_ he says:\r\n\r\n  ...’ce grand pécheur eut des conduites\r\n  Folles à ce point d’en devenir trop maladroites,\r\n  Si bien que les tribunaux s’en mirent--et les suites!\r\n  Et le voyez-vous dans la plus étroite des boîtes?\r\n\r\n  Cellules! prison humanitaires! Il faut taire\r\n  Votre horreur fadasse et ce progrès d’hypocrisie’...\r\n\r\nIt is now known that a crime of a peculiarly revolting character led\r\nto his punishment; and this is not surprising, since the special\r\ncharacteristic of his degeneration is a madly inordinate eroticism.\r\nHe is perpetually thinking of lewdness, and lascivious images fill\r\nhis mind continually. I have no wish to quote passages in which\r\nthis unhappy slave of his morbidly excited senses has expressed the\r\nloathsome condition of his mind, but the reader who wishes to become\r\nacquainted with them may be referred to the poems _Les Coquillages_,\r\n_Fille_, and _Auburn_.[124] Sexual license is not his only vice. He is\r\nalso a dipsomaniac, and (as may be expected in a degenerate subject) a\r\nparoxysmal dipsomaniac, who, awakened from his debauch, is seized with\r\ndeep disgust of the alcoholic poison and of himself, and speaks of ‘les\r\nbreuvages exécrés’ (_La Bonne Chanson_), but succumbs to the temptation\r\nat the next opportunity.\r\n\r\nMoral insanity, however, is not present in Verlaine. He sins through\r\nirresistible impulse. He is an Impulsivist. The difference between\r\nthese two forms of degeneration lies in the fact that the morally\r\ninsane does not look upon his crimes as bad, but commits them with the\r\nsame unconcern as a sane man would perform any ordinary or virtuous\r\nact, and after his misdeed is quite contented with himself; whereas the\r\nImpulsivist retains a full consciousness of the baseness of his deeds,\r\nhopelessly fights against his impulse until he can no longer resist\r\nit, and after the performance[125] suffers the most terrible remorse\r\nand despair. It is only an Impulsivist who speaks in execration of\r\nhimself as a reprobate (‘Un seul Pervers,’ in _Sagesse_), or strikes\r\nthe dejected note which Verlaine touches in the first four sonnets of\r\n_Sagesse_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Hommes durs! Vie atroce et laide d’ici bas!\r\n  Ah! que du moins, loin des baisers et des combats,\r\n  Quelque chose demeure un peu sur la montagne,\r\n\r\n  ‘Quelque chose du cœur enfantin et subtil,\r\n  Bonté, respect! car qu’est-ce qui nous accompagne,\r\n  Et vraiment quand la mort viendra que reste-t-il?...\r\n\r\n  ‘Ferme les yeux, pauvre âme, et rentre sur-le-champ:\r\n  Une tentation des pires. Fuis l’infâme ...\r\n  Si la vieille folie était encore en route?\r\n\r\n  ‘Ces souvenirs, va-t-il falloir les retuer?\r\n  Un assaut furieux, le suprême, sans doute!\r\n  O va prier contre l’orage, va prier!...\r\n\r\n  ‘C’est vers le Moyen-Age énorme et delicat\r\n  Qu’il faudrait que mon cœur en panne naviguât,\r\n  Loin de nos jours d’esprit charnel et de chair triste ...\r\n\r\n  ‘Et là que j’eusse part...\r\n  ...à la chose vitale,\r\n  Et que je fusse un saint, actes bons, pensers droits,\r\n\r\n  ‘Haute théologie et solide morale,\r\n  Guidé par la folie unique de la Croix\r\n  Sur tes ailes de pierre, ô folle Cathédrale!’\r\n\r\nThis example serves to show that there is not wanting in Verlaine\r\nthat religious fervour which usually accompanies morbidly intensified\r\neroticism. This finds a much more decided expression in several other\r\npoems. I should wish to quote only from two.[126]\r\n\r\n  ‘O mon Dieu, vous m’avez blessé d’amour,\r\n  Et la blessure est encore vibrante,\r\n  O mon Dieu, vous m’avez blessé d’amour.\r\n\r\n  ‘O mon Dieu, votre crainte m’a frappé,\r\n  Et la brûlure est encore là qui tonne\r\n  O mon Dieu, votre crainte m’a frappé.\r\n\r\n(Observe the mode of expression and the constant repetitions.)\r\n\r\n  ‘O mon Dieu, j’ai connu que tout est vil,\r\n  Et votre gloire en moi s’est installée,\r\n  O mon Dieu, j’ai connu que tout est vil.\r\n\r\n  ‘Noyez mon âme aux flots de votre vin,\r\n  Fondez ma vie au pain de votre table,\r\n  Noyez mon âme aux flots de votre vin.\r\n\r\n  ‘Voici mon sang que je n’ai pas versé,\r\n  Voici ma chair indignée de souffrance,\r\n  Voici mon sang que je n’ai pas versé.’\r\n\r\nThen follows the ecstatic enumeration of all the parts of his body,\r\nwhich he offers up in sacrifice to God; and the poem closes thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Vous connaissez tout cela, tout cela,\r\n  Et que je suis plus pauvre que personne,\r\n  Vous connaissez tout cela, tout cela,\r\n  Mais ce que j’ai, mon Dieu, je vous le donne.’\r\n\r\nHe invokes the Virgin Mary as follows:\r\n\r\n  ‘Je ne veux plus aimer que ma mère Marie.\r\n  Tous les autres amours sont de commandement,\r\n  Nécessaires qu’ils sont, ma mère seulement\r\n  Pourra les allumer aux cœurs qui l’ont chérie.\r\n\r\n  ‘C’est pour Elle qu’il faut chérir mes ennemis,\r\n  C’est pour Elle que j’ai voué ce sacrifice,\r\n  Et la douceur de cœur et le zèle au service.\r\n  Comme je la priais, Elle les a permis.\r\n\r\n  ‘Et comme j’étais faible et bien méchant encore,\r\n  Aux mains lâches, les yeux éblouis des chemins,\r\n  Elle baissa mes yeux et me joignit les mains,\r\n  Et m’enseigna les mots par lesquels on adore.’\r\n\r\nThe accents here uttered are well known to the clinics of psychiatry.\r\nWe may compare them to the picture which Legrain[127] gives of some of\r\nhis patients. ‘His speech continually reverts to God and the Virgin\r\nMary, his cousin.’ (The case in question is that of a degenerate\r\nsubject who was a tramway conductor.) ‘Mystical ideas complete the\r\npicture. He talks of God, of heaven, crosses himself, kneels down, and\r\nsays that he is following the commandments of Christ.’ (The subject\r\nunder observation is a day labourer.) ‘The devil will tempt me, but I\r\nsee God who guards me. I have asked of God that all people might be\r\nbeautiful,’ etc.\r\n\r\nThe continual alternation of antithetical moods in Verlaine--this\r\nuniform transition from bestial lust to an excess of piety, and\r\nfrom sinning to remorse--has struck even observers who do not know\r\nthe significance of such a phenomenon. ‘He is,’ writes M. Anatole\r\nFrance,[128] ‘alternately devout and atheistical, orthodox and\r\nsacrilegious.’ These he certainly is. But why? Simply because he is\r\na _circulaire_. This not very happy expression, invented by French\r\npsychiatry, denotes that form of mental disease in which states of\r\nexcitement and depression follow each other in regular succession.\r\nThe period of excitement coincides with the irresistible impulses to\r\nmisdeeds and blasphemous language; that of dejection with the paroxysms\r\nof contrition and piety. The _circulaires_ belong to the worst\r\nspecies of the degenerate. ‘They are drunkards, obscene, vicious, and\r\nthievish.’[129] They are also in particular incapable of any lasting,\r\nuniform occupation, since it is obvious that in such a condition\r\nof mental depression they cannot accomplish any work which demands\r\nstrength and attention. The _circulaires_ are, by the nature of their\r\naffliction, condemned to be vagabonds or thieves, unless they belong\r\nto rich families. In normally constituted society there is no place\r\nfor them. Verlaine has been a vagabond the whole of his life. He has\r\nloafed about all the highways of France, and roamed as well through\r\nBelgium and England. Since his release from prison he has spent most of\r\nhis time in Paris, where, however, he has no residence, but resorts to\r\nthe hospitals under the pretext of rheumatism, which for that matter\r\nhe may easily have contracted during the nights which, as a tramp, he\r\nhas spent under the open sky. The administration winks at his doings,\r\nand grants him food and shelter gratis, out of regard for his poetical\r\ncapacity. Conformably with the constant tendency of the human mind\r\nto beautify what cannot be altered, he persuades himself that his\r\nvagrancy, which was forced upon him by his organic vice, is a glorious\r\nand enviable condition; he prizes it as something beautiful, artistic,\r\nand sublime, and looks upon vagabonds with especial tenderness.\r\nSpeaking of them he says (_Grotesques_):\r\n\r\n  ‘Leur jambes pour toutes montures,\r\n  Pour tous biens l’or de leurs regards,\r\n  Par le chemin des aventures\r\n  Ils vont haillonneux et hagards.\r\n\r\n  ‘Le sage, indigné, les harangue;\r\n  Le sot plaint ces fous hasardeux;\r\n  Les enfants leur tirent la langue\r\n  Et les filles se moquent d’eux.’\r\n\r\nWe find in every lunatic and imbecile the conviction that the rational\r\nminds who discern and judge him are ‘blockheads.’\r\n\r\n  ‘... Dans leurs prunelles\r\n  Rit et pleure--fastidieux--\r\n  L’amour des choses éternelles,\r\n  Des vieux morts et des anciens dieux!\r\n\r\n  ‘Donc, allez, vagabonds sans trêves,\r\n  Errez, funestes et maudits,\r\n  Le long des gouffres et des grèves,\r\n  Sous l’œil fermé des paradis!\r\n\r\n  ‘La nature à l’homme s’allie\r\n  Pour châtier comme il le faut\r\n  L’orgueilleuse mélancolie\r\n  Qui vous fait marcher le front haut.’\r\n\r\nIn another poem (_Autre_) he calls to his chosen mates:\r\n\r\n  ‘Allons, frères, bons vieux voleurs,\r\n          Doux vagabonds\r\n          Filous en fleur\r\n          Mes chers, mes bons,\r\n\r\n  ‘Fumons philosophiquement,\r\n          Promenons nous\r\n          Paisiblement:\r\n          Rien faire est doux.’\r\n\r\nAs one vagabond feels himself attracted by other vagabonds, so does\r\none deranged mind feel drawn to others. Verlaine has the greatest\r\nadmiration for King Louis II. of Bavaria, that unhappy madman in whom\r\nintelligence was extinct long before death, in whom only the most\r\nabominable impulses of foul beasts of the most degraded kind had\r\nsurvived the perishing of the human functions of his disordered brain.\r\nHe apostrophizes him thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Roi, le seul vrai Roi de ce siècle, salut, Sire,\r\n    Qui voulûtes mourir vengeant votre raison\r\n  Des choses de la politique, et du délire\r\n    De cette Science intruse dans la maison,\r\n\r\n  ‘De cette Science assassin de l’Oraison\r\n    Et du Chant et de l’Art et de toute la Lyre,\r\n  Et simplement et plein d’orgueil et floraison\r\n    Tuâtes en mourant, salut, Roi, bravo, Sire!\r\n\r\n  ‘Vous fûtes un poète, un soldat, le seul Roi\r\n    De ce siècle ...\r\n  Et le martyr de la Raison selon la Foi....’\r\n\r\nTwo points are noticeable in Verlaine’s mode of expression. First, we\r\nhave the frequent recurrence of the same word, of the same turn of\r\nphrase, that chewing the cud, or _rabâchage_ (repetition), which we\r\nhave learnt to know as the marks of intellectual debility. In almost\r\nevery one of his poems single lines and hemistiches are repeated,\r\nsometimes unaltered, and often the same word appears instead of\r\none which rhymes. Were I to quote all the passages of this kind, I\r\nshould have to transcribe nearly all his poems. I will therefore\r\ngive only a few specimens, and those in the original, so that their\r\npeculiarity will be fully apparent to the reader. In the _Crépuscule\r\ndu soir mystique_ the lines, ‘Le souvenir avec le crépuscule,’ and\r\n‘Dahlia, lys, tulipe et renoncules,’ are twice repeated without any\r\ninternal necessity. In the poem _Promenade sentimentale_ the adjective\r\n_blême_ (wan) pursues the poet in the manner of an obsession or\r\n‘onomatomania,’ and he applies it to water-lilies and waves (‘wan\r\nwaves’). The _Nuit du Walpurgis classique_ begins thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Un rythmique sabbat, rythmique, extrêmement\r\n  Rythmique.’...\r\n\r\nIn the _Sérénade_ the first two lines are repeated _verbatim_ as the\r\nfourth and eighth. Similarly in _Ariettes oubliées_, VIII.:\r\n\r\n  ‘Dans l’interminable\r\n  Ennui de la plaine,\r\n  La neige incertaine\r\n  Luit comme du sable.\r\n\r\n  ‘Le ciel est de cuivre,\r\n  Sans lueur aucune.\r\n  On croirait voir vivre\r\n  Et mourir la lune.\r\n\r\n  ‘Comme des nuées\r\n  Flottent gris les chênes\r\n  Des forêts prochaines\r\n  Parmi les buées.\r\n\r\n  ‘Le ciel est de cuivre,\r\n  Sans lueur aucune.\r\n  On croirait voir vivre\r\n  Et mourir la lune.\r\n\r\n  ‘Corneille poussive,\r\n  Et vous, les loups maigres,\r\n  Par ces bises aigres\r\n  Quoi donc vous arrive?\r\n\r\n  ‘Dans l’interminable\r\n  Ennui de la plaine,\r\n  La neige incertaine\r\n  Luit comme du sable.’\r\n\r\nThe _Chevaux de bois_ begins thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Tournez, tournez, bons chevaux de bois,\r\n  Tournez cent tours, tournez mille tours,\r\n  Tournez souvent et tournez toujours,\r\n  Tournez, tournez au son des hautbois.’\r\n\r\nIn a truly charming piece in _Sagesse_ he says:\r\n\r\n  ‘Le ciel est, par-dessus le toit,\r\n            Si bleu, si calme!\r\n  Un arbre, par dessus le toit\r\n            Berce sa palme.\r\n\r\n  ‘La cloche, dans le ciel qu’on voit,\r\n            Doucement tinte.\r\n  Un oiseau, sur l’arbre qu’on voit,\r\n            Chante sa plainte.’\r\n\r\nIn the passage in _Amour_, ‘Les fleurs des champs, les fleurs\r\ninnombrables des champs ... les fleurs des gens,’ ‘champs’ and ‘gens’\r\nsound somewhat alike. Here the imbecile repetition of similar sounds\r\nsuggests a senseless pun, to the poet, and as for this stanza in\r\n_Pierrot gamin_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ce n’est pas Pierrot en herbe\r\n  Non plus que Pierrot en gerbe,\r\n  C’est Pierrot, Pierrot, Pierrot.\r\n  Pierrot gamin, Pierrot gosse,\r\n  Le cerneau hors de la cosse,\r\n  C’est Pierrot, Pierrot, Pierrot!’\r\n\r\nit is the language of nurses to babies, who do not care to make sense,\r\nbut only to twitter to the child in tones which give him pleasure.\r\nThe closing lines of the poem _Mains_ point to a complete ideational\r\nstandstill, to mechanical mumbling:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ah! si ce sont des mains de rêve,\r\n  Tant mieux, ou tant pis, ou tant mieux.’[130]\r\n\r\nThe second peculiarity of Verlaine’s style is the other mark of mental\r\ndebility, viz., the combination of completely disconnected nouns and\r\nadjectives, which suggest each other, either through a senseless\r\nmeandering by way of associated ideas, or through a similarity of\r\nsound. We have already found some examples of this in the extracts\r\ncited above. In these we find the ‘enormous and tender Middle Ages’ and\r\nthe ‘brand which thunders.’ Verlaine writes also of ‘feet which glide\r\nwith a pure and wide movement,’ of ‘a narrow and vast affection,’ of ‘a\r\nslow landscape,’[131] of ‘a slack liqueur’ (‘jus flasque’), ‘a gilded\r\nperfume,’ a ‘condensed’ or ‘terse contour’ (‘galbe succinct’), etc. The\r\nSymbolists admire this form of imbecility, as ‘the research for rare\r\nand precious epithets’ (la recherche de l’epithète rare et précieuse).\r\n\r\nVerlaine has a clear consciousness of the vagueness of his thoughts,\r\nand in a very remarkable poem from the psychological point of view,\r\n_Art poétique_, in which he attempts to give a theory of his lyric\r\ncreation, he raises nebulosity to the dignity of a fundamental method:\r\n\r\n  ‘De la musique avant toute chose\r\n  Et pour cela préfère l’Impair\r\n  Plus vague et plus soluble dans l’air,\r\n  Sans rien en lui qui pèse ou qui pose.’\r\n\r\nThe two verbs ‘pèse’ and ‘pose’ are juxtaposed merely on account of\r\ntheir similarity of sound.\r\n\r\n  ‘Il faut aussi que tu n’ailles point\r\n  Choisir les mots sans quelque méprise;\r\n  Rien de plus cher que la chanson grise\r\n  Où l’Indécis au Précis se joint.\r\n\r\n  ‘C’est des beaux yeux derrière des voiles,\r\n  C’est le grand jour tremblant de midi,\r\n  C’est par un ciel d’automne attiédi,\r\n  Le bleu fouillis des claires étoiles!\r\n\r\n  ‘Car nous voulons la Nuance encor,\r\n  Pas la Couleur, rien que la nuance!\r\n  Oh! la nuance seule fiance\r\n  Le rêve au rêve et la flûte au cor!’\r\n\r\n(This stanza is completely delirious; it places ‘nuance’ and ‘colour’\r\nin opposition, as though the latter were not contained in the former.\r\nThe idea of which the weak brain of Verlaine had an inkling, but could\r\nnot bring to a complete conception, is probably that he prefers subdued\r\nand mixed tints, which lie on the margin of several colours, to the\r\nfull intense colour itself.)\r\n\r\n  ‘Fuis du plus loin la Pointe assassine,\r\n  L’esprit cruel et le Rire impur,\r\n  Qui font pleurer les yeux de l’Azur,\r\n  Et tout cet ail de basse cuisine!’\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that this poetical method in the hands of Verlaine\r\noften yields extraordinarily beautiful results. There are few poems in\r\nFrench literature which can rival the _Chanson d’Automne_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Les sanglots longs\r\n  Des violons\r\n        De l’automne\r\n  Blessent mon cœur\r\n  D’une langueur\r\n        Monotone.\r\n\r\n  ‘Tout suffocant\r\n  Et blême, quand\r\n        Sonne l’heure,\r\n  ‘Je me souviens\r\n  Des jours anciens,\r\n        Et je pleure.\r\n\r\n  ‘Et je m’en vais\r\n  Au vent mauvais\r\n        Qui m’emporte\r\n  Deçà, delà,\r\n  Pareil à la\r\n        Feuille morte.’\r\n\r\nEven if literally translated, there remains something of the melancholy\r\nmagic of the lines, which in French are richly rhythmical and full of\r\nmusic. _Avant que tu ne t’en ailles_ (p. 99) and _Il pleure dans mon\r\ncœur_ (p. 116) may also be called pearls among French lyrics.\r\n\r\nThis is because the methods of a highly emotional, but intellectually\r\nincapable, dreamer suffice for poetry which deals exclusively with\r\nmoods, but this is the inexorable limit of his power. Let the true\r\nmeaning of mood be always present with us. The word denotes a state of\r\nmind, in which, through organic excitations which it cannot directly\r\nperceive, consciousness is filled with presentations of a uniform\r\nnature, which it elaborates with greater or less clearness, and one\r\nand all of which relate to those organic excitations inaccessible to\r\nconsciousness. The mere succession of words, giving a name to these\r\npresentations, the roots of which are in the unknown, expresses\r\nthe mood, and is able to awaken it in another. It has no need of a\r\nfundamental thought, or of a progressive exposition to unfold it.\r\nVerlaine often attains to astonishing effects in such poetry of moods.\r\nWhere, however, distinct vision, or a feeling the motive of which is\r\nclear to consciousness, or a process well delimitated in time and\r\nspace, is to be poetically rendered, the poetic art of the emotional\r\nimbecile fails utterly. In a healthy and sane poet even the mood\r\npure and simple is united to clear presentations, and is not a mere\r\nundulation of fragrance and rose-tinted mist. Poems like Goethe’s\r\n_Ueber allen Gipfeln ist Ruh_, _Der Fischer_, or _Freudvoll und\r\nleidvoll_, can never be created by the emotionally degenerate; but,\r\non the other hand, the most marvellous of Goethe’s poems are not so\r\nutterly incorporeal, not such mere sighs, as three or four of the best\r\nof a Verlaine.\r\n\r\nWe have now the portrait of this most famous leader of the Symbolists\r\nclearly before us. We see a repulsive degenerate subject with\r\nasymmetric skull and Mongolian face, an impulsive vagabond and\r\ndipsomaniac, who, under the most disgraceful circumstances, was placed\r\nin gaol; an emotional dreamer of feeble intellect, who painfully fights\r\nagainst his bad impulses, and in his misery often utters touching\r\nnotes of complaint; a mystic whose qualmish consciousness is flooded\r\nwith ideas of God and saints, and a dotard who manifests the absence\r\nof any definite thought in his mind by incoherent speech, meaningless\r\nexpressions and motley images. In lunatic asylums there are many\r\npatients whose disease is less deep-seated and incurable than is that\r\nof this irresponsible _circulaire_ at large, whom only ignorant judges\r\ncould have condemned for his epileptoid crimes.\r\n\r\nA second leader among the Symbolists, whose prestige is in no quarter\r\ndisputed, is M. Stéphane Mallarmé. He is the most curious phenomenon\r\nin the intellectual life of contemporary France. Although long past\r\nfifty years of age, he has written hardly anything, and the little that\r\nis known of him is, in the opinion of his most unreserved admirers,\r\nof no account; and yet he is esteemed as a very great poet, and\r\nthe utter infertility of his pen, the entire absence of any single\r\nwork which he can produce as evidence of his poetical capacity, is\r\nprized as his greatest merit, and as a most striking proof of his\r\nintellectual importance. This statement must appear so fabulous to any\r\nreader not deranged in mind, that he may rightly demand proofs of\r\nthese statements. M. Charles Morice[132] says of Mallarmé: ‘I am not\r\nobliged to unveil the secrets of the works of a poet who, as he has\r\nhimself remarked, is excluded from all participation in any official\r\nexposition of the beautiful. The fact itself that these works are\r\nstill unknown ... would seem to forbid our associating the name of\r\nM. Mallarmé with those of men who have given us books. I let vulgar\r\ncriticism buzz without replying to it, and state that M. Mallarmé,\r\nwithout having given us books ... is famous--a fame which, of course,\r\nhas not been won without arousing the laughter of stupidity in both\r\npetty and important newspapers, but which does not offer public and\r\nprivate ... ineptitude that opportunity for showing its baseness which\r\nis provoked by the advent of a new wonder.... The people, in spite\r\nof their abhorrence of the beautiful, and especially of novelty in\r\nthe beautiful, have gradually, and in spite of themselves, come to\r\ncomprehend the prestige of a legitimate authority. They themselves,\r\neven they, feel ashamed of their foolish laughter; and before this man,\r\nwhom that laughter could not tear from the serenity of his meditative\r\nsilence, laughter became dumb, and itself suffered the divine contagion\r\nof silence. Even for the million this man, who published no books, and\r\nwhom, nevertheless, all designated “a poet,” became, as it were, the\r\nvery symbol of a poet, seeking, where possible, to draw near to the\r\nabsolute.... By his silence, he has signified that he ... cannot yet\r\nrealize the unprecedented work of art which he wishes to create. Should\r\ncruel life refuse to support him in his effort, our respect--nay, more,\r\nour veneration--can alone give an answer worthy of a reticence thus\r\nconditioned.’\r\n\r\nThe graphomaniac Morice (of whose crazy and distorted style of\r\nexpression this literally translated example gives a very good idea)\r\nassumes that perhaps Mallarmé will yet create his ‘unprecedented\r\nwork.’ Mallarmé himself, however, denies us the right to any such\r\nhope. ‘The delicious Mallarmé,’ Paul Hervieu relates,[133] ‘told me\r\none day ... he could not understand that anyone should let himself\r\nappear in print. Such a proceeding gave him the impression of an\r\nindecency, an aberration, resembling that form of mental disease called\r\n“exhibitionism.” Moreover, no one has been so discreet with his soul as\r\nthis incomparable thinker.’[134]\r\n\r\nSo, then, this ‘incomparable thinker’ shows ‘a complete discretion\r\nas regards his soul.’ At one time he bases his silence on a sort of\r\nshamed timidity at publicity; at another, on the fact that he ‘cannot\r\nyet realize the unprecedented work of art which he wishes to create,’\r\ntwo reasons for that matter reciprocally precluding each other. He is\r\napproaching the evening of his life, and beyond a few brochures, such\r\nas _Les Dieux de la Grèce_ and _L’après-midi d’un Faune_, together\r\nwith some verses and literary and theatrical criticisms, scattered in\r\nperiodicals, the lot barely sufficing for a volume, he has published\r\nnothing but some translations from the English and a few school-books\r\n(M. Mallarmé is a teacher of English in a Parisian lycée), and yet\r\nthere are some who admire him as a great poet, as the one exclusive\r\npoet, and they overwhelm the ‘blockheads’ and the ‘fools’ who laugh at\r\nhim with all the expressions of scorn that the force of imagination\r\nin a diseased mind can display. Is not this one of the wonders of our\r\nday? Lessing makes Conti, in _Emilia Galotti_, say that ‘Raphael would\r\nhave been the greatest genius in painting, even if he had unfortunately\r\nbeen born without hands.’ In M. Mallarmé we have a man who is revered\r\nas a great poet, although ‘he has unfortunately been born without\r\nhands,’ although he produces nothing, although he does not pursue the\r\nart he professes. During the period when in London a great number of\r\nbubble-company swindles were being promoted, when all the world went\r\nmad for the possession of the least scrap of Stock Exchange paper, it\r\nhappened that a few sharp individuals advertised in the newspapers,\r\ninviting people to subscribe for shares in a company of which the\r\nobject was kept a secret. There really were men who brought their\r\nmoney to these lively promoters, and the historian of the City crisis\r\nregards this fact as inconceivable. Inconceivable as it is, Paris sees\r\nit repeated. Some persons demand unbounded admiration for a poet whose\r\nworks are his own secret, and will probably remain such, and others\r\ntrustingly and humbly bring their admiration as required. The sorcerers\r\nof the Senegal negroes offer their congregation baskets and calabashes\r\nfor veneration, in which they assert that a mighty fetich is enclosed.\r\nAs a matter of fact they contain nothing; but the negroes regard the\r\nempty vessels with holy dread, and show them and their possessors\r\ndivine honours. Exactly thus is empty Mallarmé the fetich of the\r\nSymbolists, who, it must be admitted, are intellectually far below the\r\nSenegal negroes.\r\n\r\nThis position of a calabash worshipped on bended knees he has attained\r\nby oral discourse. Every week he gathers round him embryonic poets and\r\nauthors, and develops his art theories before them. He speaks just as\r\nMorice and Kahn write. He strings together obscure and wondrous words,\r\nat which his disciples become as stupid ‘as if a mill-wheel were going\r\nround in their heads,’ so that they leave him as if intoxicated, and\r\nwith the impression that incomprehensible, superhuman disclosures\r\nhave been made to them. If there is anything comprehensible in the\r\nincoherent flow of Mallarmé’s words, it is perhaps his admiration\r\nfor the pre-Raphaelites. It was he who drew the attention of the\r\nSymbolists to this school, and enjoined imitation of it. It is through\r\nMallarmé that the French mystics received their English mediævalism and\r\nneo-Catholicism. Finally, it may be mentioned that among the physical\r\nfeatures of Mallarmé are ‘long pointed faun-like ears.’[135] After\r\nDarwin, who was the first to point out the apish character of this\r\npeculiarity, Hartmann,[136] Frigerio,[137] and Lombroso,[138] have\r\nfirmly established the connection between immoderately long and pointed\r\nexternal ears and atavism and degeneration; and they have shown that\r\nthis peculiarity is of especially frequent occurrence among criminals\r\nand lunatics.\r\n\r\nThe third among the leading spirits of the Symbolists is Jean Moréas, a\r\nFranco-Greek poet, who at the completion of his thirty-sixth year (his\r\nfriends assert, it may be in friendly malice, that he makes himself\r\nout to be very much younger than he is) has produced _in toto_ three\r\nattenuated collections of verses, of hardly one hundred to one hundred\r\nand twenty pages, bearing the titles, _Les Syrtes_, _Les Cantilènes_,\r\nand _Le Pélerin passionné_. The importance of a literary performance\r\ndoes not, of course, depend upon its amplitude, if it is otherwise\r\nunusually significant. When, however, a man cackles during interminable\r\ncafé séances of the renewal of poetry and the unfolding of a new art\r\nof the future, and finally produces three little brochures of childish\r\nverses as the result of his world-stirring effort, then the material\r\ninsignificance of the performance also becomes a subject for ridicule.\r\n\r\nMoréas is one of the inventors of the word ‘Symbolism.’ For some few\r\nyears he was the high-priest of this secret doctrine, and administered\r\nthe duties of his service with requisite seriousness. One day he\r\nsuddenly abjured his self-founded faith, and declared that ‘Symbolism’\r\nhad always been meant only as a joke, to lead fools by the nose withal;\r\nand that the true salvation of poetry was in Romanism (_romanisme_).\r\nUnder this new word he affirms a return to the language, versification\r\nand mode of feeling of the French poets at the close of the Middle\r\nAges, and of the Renaissance period; but it were well to adopt his\r\ndeclarations with caution, since in two or three years he may be\r\nproclaiming his ‘romanisme’ as much a tap-room joke as his ‘symbolism.’\r\nThe appearance of the _Pélerin passionné_ in 1891 was celebrated by\r\nthe Symbolists as an event which was to be the beginning of a new era\r\nin poetry. They arranged a banquet in honour of Moréas, and in the\r\nafter-dinner speeches he was worshipped as the deliverer from the\r\nshackles of ancient forms and notions, and as the saviour who was\r\nbringing in the kingdom of God of true poetry. And the same poets who\r\nsat at the table with Moréas, and delivered to him rapturous addresses\r\nor joined in the applause, a few weeks after this event overwhelmed\r\nhim with contumely and contempt. ‘Moréas a Symbolist!’ cried Charles\r\nVignier.[139] ‘Is he one through his ideas? He laughs at them himself!\r\nHis thoughts! They don’t weigh much, these thoughts of Jean Moréas!’\r\n‘Moréas?’ asks Adrien Remacle,[140] ‘we have all been laughing at him.\r\nIt is that which has made him famous.’ René Ghil calls his _Pélerin\r\npassionné_ ‘doggerel written by a pedant,’ and Gustav Kahn[141] passes\r\nsentence on him thus: ‘Moréas has no talent.... He has never done\r\nanything worth mentioning. He has his own particular jargon.’ These\r\nexpressions disclose to us the complete hollowness and falseness of the\r\nSymbolistic movement, which outside France is obstinately proclaimed\r\nas a serious matter by imbeciles and speculators, although its French\r\ninventors make themselves hoarse in trying to convince the world that\r\nthey merely wanted to banter the Philistine with a tap-room jest and\r\nadvertise themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter the verdict of his brethren in the Symbolist Parnassus, I may\r\nreally spare myself the trouble of dwelling longer on Moréas; I will,\r\nhowever, cite a few examples from his _Pélerin passionné_, in order\r\nthat the reader may form an idea of the softness of brain which\r\ndisplays itself in these verses.\r\n\r\nThe poem Agnes[142] begins thus:\r\n\r\n      ‘Il y avait des arcs où passaient des escortes\r\n      Avec des bannières de deuil et du fer\r\n      Lacé (?) des potentats de toutes sortes\r\n      --Il y avait--dans la cité au bord de la mer.\r\n      Les places étaient noires, et bien pavées, et les portes,\r\n      Du côté de l’est et de l’ouest, hautes; et comme en hiver\r\n      La forêt, dépérissaient les salles de palais, et les porches,\r\n      Et les colonnades de belvéder.\r\n  C’était (tu dois bien t’en souvenir) c’était aux plus beaux jours de\r\n    ton adolescence.\r\n\r\n      ‘Dans la cité au bord de la mer, la cape et la dague lourdes\r\n      De pierres jaunes, et sur ton chapeau des plumes de perroquets,\r\n      Tu t’en venais, devisant telles bourdes,\r\n      Tu t’en venais entre tes deux laquais\r\n      Si bouffis et tant sots--en verité, des happelourdes!--\r\n      Dans la cité au bord de la mer tu t’en venais et tu vaguais\r\n      Parmi de grands vieillards qui travaillaient aux felouques,\r\n      Le long des môles et des quais.\r\n  C’était (tu dois bien t’en souvenir) c’était aux plus beaux jours de\r\n    ton adolescence.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the twaddle goes on through eight more stanzas, and in every\r\nline we find the characteristics of the language used by imbeciles and\r\nmade notorious by Sollier (_Psychologie de l’Idiot et de l’Imbécile_),\r\nthe ‘ruminating’ as it were, of the same expressions, the dreamy\r\nincoherence of the language, and the insertion of words which have no\r\nconnection with the subject.\r\n\r\nTwo _Chansons_[143] run thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Les courlis dans les roseaux!\r\n  (Faut-il que je vous en parle,\r\n  Des courlis dans les roseaux?)\r\n  O vous joli’ Fée des eaux.\r\n\r\n  ‘Le porcher et les pourceaux!\r\n  (Faut-il que je vous en parle,\r\n  Du porcher et des pourceaux?)\r\n  O vous joli’ Fée des eaux.\r\n\r\n  ‘Mon cœur pris en vos réseaux!\r\n  (Faut-il que je vous en parle,\r\n  De mon cœur en vos réseaux?)\r\n  O vous joli’ Fée des eaux.\r\n\r\n  ‘On a marché sur les fleurs au bord de la route,\r\n  Et le vent d’automne les secoue si fort, en outre.\r\n\r\n  ‘La malle-poste a renversé la vieille croix au bord de la route;\r\n  Elle était vraiment si pourrie, en outre.\r\n\r\n  ‘L’idiot (tu sais) est mort au bord de la route,\r\n  Et personne ne le pleurera, en outre.’\r\n\r\nThe stupid artifice with which Moréas here seeks to produce a feeling\r\nof wretchedness by conjuring up the three associated figures of crushed\r\nflowers, dishevelled by the wind, an overturned and mouldering cross,\r\nand a dead, unmourned idiot, makes this poem a model of the would-be\r\nprofound production of a madhouse!\r\n\r\nWhen Moréas is not soft of brain, he develops a rhetorical turgidity\r\nwhich reminds us of Hofmann von Hofmannswaldau in his worst efforts.\r\nOnly one example[144] of this kind, and we have done with him:\r\n\r\n  ‘J’ai tellement soif, ô mon amour, de ta bouche,\r\n  Que j’y boirais en baisers le cours detourné\r\n  Du Strymon, l’Araxe et le Tanaïs farouche;\r\n  Et les cent méandres qui arrosent Pitané,\r\n  Et l’Hermus qui prend sa source où le soleil se couche,\r\n  Et toutes les claires fontaines dont abonde Gaza,\r\n  Sans que ma soif s’en apaisât.’\r\n\r\nBehind the leaders Verlaine, Mallarmé, and Moréas a troop of minor\r\nSymbolists throng, each, it is true, in his own eyes the one great\r\npoet of the band, but whose illusions of greatness do not entitle\r\nthem to any special observation. Sufficient justice is dealt them if\r\nthe spirit they are made of be characterized by quoting a few lines\r\nof their poetry. Jules Laforgue, ‘unique not only in his generation,\r\nbut in all the republic of literature,’[145] cries: ‘Oh, how daily\r\n[_quotidienne_] is life!’ and in his poem _Pan et la Syrinx_ we come\r\nupon lines like the following:\r\n\r\n  ‘O Syrinx! voyez et comprenez la Terre et la merveille de cette\r\n      matinée et la circulation de la vie.\r\n  Oh, vous là! et moi, ici! Oh vous! Oh, moi! Tout est dans Tout!’[146]\r\n\r\nGustav Kahn, one of the æstheticists and philosophers of Symbolism,\r\nsays in his _Nuit sur la Lande_: ‘Peace descends from thy lovely eyes\r\nlike a great evening, and the borders of slow tents descend, studded\r\nwith precious stones, woven of far-off beams and unknown moons.’\r\n\r\nIn German, at least, ‘borders of slow tents which descend’ is\r\ncompletely unintelligible nonsense. In French they are also\r\nunintelligible; but in the original their meaning becomes apparent.\r\n‘Et des pans de tentes lentes descendent,’ the line runs, and betrays\r\nitself as pure echolalia, as a succession of similar sounds, as it\r\nwere, echoing each other.\r\n\r\nCharles Vignier, ‘the beloved disciple of Verlaine,’ says to his\r\nmistress:\r\n\r\n  ‘Là-bas c’est trop loin,\r\n  Pauvre libellule,\r\n  Reste dans ton coin\r\n  Et prends des pilules...\r\n\r\n  ‘Sois Edmond About\r\n  Et d’humeur coulante,\r\n  Sois un marabout\r\n  Du Jardin des Plantes.’\r\n\r\nAnother of his poems, _Une Coupe de Thulé_, runs thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘Dans une coupe de Thulé\r\n  Où vient pâlir l’attrait de l’heure,\r\n  Dort le sénile et dolent leurre\r\n  De l’ultime rêve adulé.\r\n\r\n  ‘Mais des cheveux d’argent filé\r\n  Font un voile à celle qui pleure,\r\n  Dans une coupe de Thulé\r\n  Où s’est éteint l’attrait de l’heure.\r\n\r\n  ‘Et l’on ne sait quel jubilé\r\n  Célèbre une harpe mineure\r\n  Que le hautain fantôme effleure\r\n  D’un lucide doigt fuselé!...\r\n  Dans une coupe de Thulé!’\r\n\r\nThese poems remind us so forcibly of those doggerel rhymes at which in\r\nGermany jovial students are often wont to try their skill, and which\r\nare known as ‘flowery [_lit._ blooming] nonsense,’ that, in spite of\r\nthe solemn assurance of French critics, I am convinced that they were\r\nintended as a joke. If I am right in my supposition, they are really\r\nevidences, not of the mental status of Vignier, but of his readers,\r\nadmirers, and critics.\r\n\r\nLouis Dumur addresses the Neva in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  ‘Puissante, magnifique, illustre, grave, noble reine!\r\n  O Tsaristsa [_sic!_] de glace et de fastes Souveraine!\r\n  Matrone hiératique et solennelle et vénérée!...\r\n  Toi qui me forces à rêver, toi qui me deconcertes,\r\n  Et toi surtout que j’aime, Émail, Beauté, Poème, Femme.\r\n  Néva! j’évoque ton spectacle et l’hymne de ton âme!’\r\n\r\nAnd René Ghil, one of the best-known Symbolists (he is chief of a\r\nschool entitled ‘évolutive-instrumentiste’), draws from his lyre these\r\ntones, which I also quote in French; in the first place because they\r\nwould lose their ring in a translation, and, secondly, because if I\r\nwere to translate them literally, it is hopeless to suppose that the\r\nreader would think I was serious:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ouïs! ouïs aux nues haut et nues où\r\n  Tirent-ils d’aile immense qui vire ...\r\n          et quand vide\r\n  et vers les grands pétales dans l’air plus aride--\r\n\r\n  ‘(Et en le lourd venir grandi lent stridule, et\r\n  Titille qui n’alentisse d’air qui dure, et!\r\n  Grandie, erratile et multiple d’éveils, stride\r\n  Mixte, plainte et splendeur! la plénitude aride)\r\n\r\n  ‘et vers les grands pétales d’agitations\r\n  Lors évanouissait un vol ardent qui stride....\r\n\r\n  ‘(des saltigrades doux n’iront plus vers les mers....)’\r\n\r\nOne thing must be acknowledged, and that is, the Symbolists have\r\nan astonishing gift for titles. The book itself may belong to pure\r\nmadhouse literature; the title is always remarkable. We have already\r\nseen that Moréas names one of his collection of verses _Les Syrtes_.\r\nHe might in truth just as well call it the _North Pole_, or _The\r\nMarmot_, or _Abd-el-Kader_, since these have just as much connection\r\nwith the poems in the little volume as _Syrtes_; but it is undeniable\r\nthat this geographical name calls up the lustre of an African sun, and\r\nthe pale reflection of classic antiquity, which may well please the\r\neye of the hysteric reader. Edouard Dubus entitles his poem, _Quand\r\nles Violons sont partis_; Louis Dumur, _Lassitudes_; Gustave Khan,\r\n_Les Palais nomades_; Maurice du Plessis, _La Peau de Marsyas_; Ernest\r\nRaynaud, _Chairs profanes_ and _Le Signe_; Henri de Régnier, _Sites\r\net Episodes_; Arthur Rimbaud, _Les Illuminations_; Albert Saint Paul,\r\n_L’Echarpe d’Iris_; Viélé-Griffin, _Ancæus_; and Charles Vignier,\r\n_Centon_.\r\n\r\nOf the prose of the Symbolists, I have already given some examples.\r\nI should further like to cite only a few passages from a book which\r\nthe Symbolists declare to be one of their most powerful mental\r\nmanifestations, _La Littérature de tout-à-l’heure_, by Charles Morice.\r\nIt is a sort of bird’s-eye view of the development of literature up to\r\nthe present time, a rapid critique of the more and most recent books\r\nand authors, a kind of programme of the literature of the future. This\r\nbook is one of the most astonishing which exists in any language. It\r\nstrongly resembles _Rembrandt as Educator_, but is far beyond that\r\nbook in the utter senselessness of its concatenations of words. It is\r\na monument of pure literary insanity, of ‘graphomania’; and neither\r\nDelepierre in his _Littérature des Fous_, nor Philomnestes (Gustave\r\nBrunet) in his _Fous Littéraires_, quotes examples of more complete\r\nmental dislocation than are visible in every page of this book. Notice\r\nthe following confession of faith by Morice:[147] ‘Although in this\r\nbook treating only of æsthetics--although of æsthetics based upon\r\nmetaphysics--we shall remember to refrain, as far as possible, from\r\npure philosophizing, we must approximately paraphrase a word which will\r\nmore than once be made use of, and which, in the highest sense here\r\nput upon it, is not incapable of being paraphrased. God is the first\r\nand universal cause, the final and universal end; the bond between\r\nspirits; the point of intersection where two parallels would meet; the\r\nfulfilment of our inclinations; the fruition which accords with the\r\nglories of our dreams; the abstraction itself of the concrete; the\r\nunseen and unheard and yet certain ideal of our demands for beauty\r\nin truth. God is, par excellence, THE very word--the very word, that\r\nis to say, that unknown certain word of which every author has the\r\nincontrovertible, but undiscernible idea, the self-evident but hidden\r\ngoal which he will never reach, and which he approaches as near as\r\npossible. In, so to say, practical æsthetics He is the atmosphere\r\nof joy in which the mind revels victorious, because it has reduced\r\nirreducible mystery to imperishable symbols.’ I do not for a moment\r\ndoubt that this incomparable jumble will be quite intelligible to\r\ntheologians. Like all mystics, they discover a sense in every sound;\r\nthat is, they persuade themselves and others that the nebulous ideas\r\nwhich the sound awakens in their brains by association are the meaning\r\nof that sound. But anyone who demands of words that they should be the\r\nmedia of definite thoughts, will perceive in the face of this twaddle\r\nthat the author was not thinking anything at all when he wrote,\r\nalthough he was dreaming of many things. ‘Religion’ is for Morice (p.\r\n56), ‘the source of art, and art in its essence is religious’--an\r\naffirmation which he borrows from Ruskin, although he does not\r\nacknowledge it. ‘Our scholars, our thinkers ... the luminous heads of\r\nthe nineteenth century,’ are ‘Edgar Poe, Carlyle, Herbert Spencer,\r\nDarwin, Auguste Comte, Claude Bernard, Berthelot’ (p. 57). Edgar Poe\r\nby the side of Spencer, Darwin, and Claude Bernard! never have ideas\r\ndanced a crazier fools’ quadrille in a disordered brain.\r\n\r\nAnd this book, of which the passages we have cited give a sufficiently\r\ncorrect idea, was, in France (just as _Rembrandt as Educator_ was in\r\nGermany), pronounced by thoroughly responsible critics to be ‘strange,\r\nbut interesting and suggestive.’ A poor degenerate devil who scribbles\r\nsuch stuff, and an imbecile reader who follows his twaddle like passing\r\nclouds, are simply to be pitied. But what words of contempt are strong\r\nenough for the sane intellectual tatterdemalions who, in order not\r\nto offend or else to give themselves the appearance of possessing\r\na remarkable faculty of comprehension, or to affect fairness and\r\nbenevolence even towards those whose opinions they in part do not\r\nshare, insist that they discover in books of this kind many a truth,\r\nmuch wit along with peculiar whims, an ideal of fervour and frequent\r\nlightnings of thought?\r\n\r\nThe word ‘Symbolism’ conveys, as we have seen, no idea to its\r\ninventors. They pursue no definite artistic tendency; hence it is\r\nnot possible to show them that their tendency is a false one. It is\r\notherwise with some of their disciples, who joined their ranks, partly\r\nthrough a desire to advertise themselves, partly because they thought\r\nthat, in the conflicts between literary parties, they were fighting\r\non the side which was the stronger and the more sure of victory, and\r\npartly, also, through the folly of fashion, and through the influence\r\nexerted by any noisy novelty over uncritical minds. Less weak-brained\r\nthan the leaders, they felt the need of giving the word ‘Symbolism’ a\r\ncertain significance, and, in fact, drew up a number of axioms which,\r\naccording to their profession, serve to guide them in their creations.\r\nThese axioms are sufficiently defined to allow of discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Symbolists demand greater freedom in the treatment of French verse.\r\nThey fiercely rebel against the old alexandrines, with the cæsura in\r\nthe middle, and the necessary termination of the sentence at the end;\r\nagainst the prohibition of the hiatus; against the law of a regular\r\nalternation of masculine and feminine rhymes. They make defiant use\r\nof the ‘free verse,’ with length and rhythm _ad libitum_, and false\r\nrhymes. The foreigner can only smile at the savage gestures with which\r\nthis conflict is carried on. It is a schoolboys’ war against some\r\nhated book, which is solemnly torn in pieces, trodden under foot, and\r\nburned. The whole dispute concerning prosody and the rules of rhyme\r\nis, so to speak, an inter-Gallic concern, and is of no consequence to\r\nthe literature of the world. We have long had everything which the\r\nFrench poets are only now seeking to obtain by barricades and street\r\nmassacres. In Goethe’s _Prometheus_, _Mahomet’s Gesang_, _Harzreise im\r\nWinter_, in Heine’s _Nordsee Cyklus_, etc., we possess perfect models\r\nof free verse; we alternate the rhymes as we will; we allow masculine\r\nand feminine rhymes to follow one another as seems good to us; we do\r\nnot bind ourselves to the rigid law of old classic metres, but suffer,\r\nin the cradling measure of our verse, anapæsts to alternate with\r\niambics and spondees, according to our feeling for euphony. English,\r\nItalian and Sclavonic poetry have gone equally far, and if the French\r\nalone have remained behind, and have at last found a need for casting\r\naside their old matted, moth-eaten periwig, this is quite reasonable;\r\nbut to anyone but a Frenchman they merely make themselves ridiculous\r\nwhen they trumpet their painful hobbling after the nations who are far\r\nin front of them, as an unheard-of discovery of new paths and opening\r\nup of new roads, and as an advance inspired by the ideal into the dawn\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nAnother æsthetic demand of the Symbolists is that the line should,\r\nindependently of its sense, call forth an intended emotion merely by\r\nits sound. A word should produce an effect, not through the idea which\r\nit embodies, but as a tone, language becoming music. It is noteworthy\r\nthat many of the Symbolists have given their books titles which are\r\nintended to awaken musical ideas. We find _Les Gammes_ (The Scales),\r\nby Stuart Merrill; _Les Cantilènes_, by Jean Moréas; _Cloches dans la\r\nNuit_, by Adolphe Retté; _Romances sans Paroles_, by Paul Verlaine,\r\netc. To make use of language as a musical instrument for the production\r\nof pure tone effects is the delirious idea of a mystic. We have seen\r\nthat the pre-Raphaelites demand of the fine arts that they should not\r\nrepresent the concrete plastically or optically, but should express\r\nthe abstract, and therefore simply undertake the _rôle_ of alphabetic\r\nwriting. Similarly, the Symbolists displace all the natural boundary\r\nlines of art, and impose upon the word a task which belongs to musical\r\nsigns only. But while the pre-Raphaelites wish to raise the fine arts\r\nto a higher rank than is suited to them, the Symbolists greatly degrade\r\nthe word. In its origin sound is musical. It expresses no definite\r\nidea, but only a general emotion of the animal. The cricket fiddles,\r\nthe nightingale trills, when sexually excited. The bear growls when\r\nstirred by the rage of conflict; the lion roars in his pleasure when\r\ntearing a living prey. In proportion as the brain develops in the\r\nanimal kingdom, and mental life becomes richer, the means of vocal\r\nexpression are evolved and differentiated, and become capable of making\r\nperceptible to the senses not only simple generic emotions, but also\r\npresentative complexes of a more restricted and definitely delimitated\r\nnature--nay, if Professor Garner’s observations concerning the language\r\nof apes are accurate, even tolerably distinct single presentations.\r\nSound, as a means of expressing mental operations, reaches its final\r\nperfection in cultivated, grammatically articulated language, inasmuch\r\nas it can then follow exactly the intellectual working of the brain,\r\nand make it objectively perceptible in all the minutest details. To\r\nbring the word, pregnant with thought, back to the emotional sound is\r\nto renounce all the results of organic development, and to degrade\r\nman, rejoicing in the power of speech, to the level of the whirring\r\ncricket or the croaking frog. The efforts of the Symbolists, then,\r\nresult in senseless twaddle, but not in the word-music they intend,\r\nfor this simply does not exist. No word of any single human language\r\nis, as such, musical. Many languages abound in consonants; in others\r\nvowels predominate. The former require more dexterity in the muscles\r\nemployed in speaking; their pronunciation, therefore, counts as more\r\ndifficult, and they seem less agreeable to the ears of foreigners than\r\nthe languages which are rich in vowels. But this has nothing to do\r\nwith the musical side of the question. What remains of the phonetic\r\neffect of a word if it is whispered, or if it is only visible as a\r\nwritten character? And yet in both cases it is able to awaken the same\r\nemotions, as if it had reached consciousness full-toned through the\r\nsense of hearing. Let anyone have read aloud to him the most cleverly\r\nchosen arrangement of words in a language completely unknown to him,\r\nand try to produce in himself a definite emotion through the mere\r\nphonetic effect. In every case it will be found impossible. The meaning\r\nof a word, and not its sound, determines its value. The sound is as\r\nsuch neither beautiful nor ugly. It becomes so only through the voice\r\nwhich gives it life. Even the first soliloquy in Goethe’s _Iphigenie_\r\nwould be ugly coming from the throat of a drunkard. I have had the\r\nopportunity of convincing myself that even the Hottentot language,\r\nspoken in a mellow, agreeable contralto voice, could be pleasing.\r\n\r\nStill more cracked is the craze of a sub-section of the Symbolists,\r\nthe ‘Instrumentalists,’ whose spokesman is René Ghil. They connect\r\neach sound with a definite feeling of colour, and demand that the\r\nword should not only awaken musical emotion, but at the same time\r\noperate æsthetically in producing a colour-harmony. This mad idea has\r\nits origin in a much-quoted sonnet by Arthur Rimbaud, _Les Voyelles_\r\n(Vowels), of which the first line runs thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘A black, e white, i red, u green, o blue.’\r\n\r\nMorice declares[148] explicitly (what in any case no one in a sane\r\nstate of mind would have doubted) that Rimbaud wished to make one\r\nof those silly jokes which imbeciles and idiots are in the habit\r\nof perpetrating. Some of his comrades, however, took the sonnet in\r\ngrim earnest, and deduced from it a theory of art. In his _Traité du\r\nVerbe_ René Ghil specifies the colour-value, not only of individual\r\nvowels, but of musical instruments. ‘Harps establish their supremacy\r\nby being white. And violins are blue, often softened by a shimmer of\r\nlight, to subdue paroxysms.’ (It is to be hoped the reader will duly\r\nappraise these combinations of words.) ‘In the exuberance of ovations,\r\nbrass instruments are red, flutes yellow, allowing the childlike to\r\nproclaim itself astonished at the luminance of the lips. And the organ,\r\nsynthesis of all simple instruments, bewails deafness of earth and\r\nthe flesh all in black....’ Another Symbolist, who has many admirers,\r\nM. Francis Poictevin, teaches us, in _Derniers Songes_, to know\r\nthe feelings corresponding to colours. ‘Blue goes--without more of\r\npassion--from love to death; or, more accurately, it is a lost extreme.\r\nFrom turquoise blue to indigo, one goes from the most shame-faced\r\ninfluences to final ravages.’\r\n\r\nWiseacres were, of course, at once to the fore, and set up a\r\nquasi-scientific theory of ‘colour-hearing.’ Sounds are said to\r\nawaken sensations of colour in many persons. According to some, this\r\nwas a gift of specially finely organized nervous natures; according\r\nto others, it was due to an accidental abnormal connection between\r\nthe optic and acoustic brain-centres by means of nerve filaments.\r\nThis anatomical explanation is entirely arbitrary, and has not been\r\nsubstantiated by any facts. But ‘colour-hearing’ itself is by no means\r\nconfirmed. The most complete book hitherto published on this subject,\r\nthe author of which is the French oculist, Suarez de Mendoza,[149]\r\ncollects all the available observations on this alleged phenomenon,\r\nand deduces from them the following definition: ‘It is the faculty\r\nof associating tones and colours, by which every objective acoustic\r\nperception of sufficient intensity, nay, even the memory-image of such\r\na perception, arouses in certain persons a luminous or non-luminous\r\nimage, which is always the same for the same letters, the same tone\r\nof voice or instrument, and the same intensity or pitch of tone.’\r\nSuarez well hits the truth when he says, ‘Colour-hearing’ (he calls\r\nit _pseudo-photesthésie_) ‘is often a consequence of an association\r\nof ideas established in youth ... and often of a special action of\r\nthe brain, the particular nature of which is unknown to us, and may\r\nhave a certain similarity to sense-illusion and hallucination.’ For my\r\npart, I have no doubt that colour-hearing is always the consequence\r\nof association of ideas, the origins of which must remain obscure,\r\nbecause the combination of certain presentations of colour with certain\r\nsensations of sound may possibly depend upon the very evanescent\r\nperceptions of early childhood, which were not powerful enough to\r\narouse the attention, and have therefore remained undiscerned in\r\nconsciousness. That it is a question of purely individual associations\r\nbrought about by the accident of associated ideas, and not of organic\r\nco-ordinations depending upon definite abnormal nervous connections,\r\nis made very probable by the fact that every colour-hearer ascribes a\r\ndifferent colour to the same vowel or instrument. We have seen that\r\nto Ghil the flute is yellow, to L. Hoffmann (whom Goethe cites in his\r\n_Farbenlehre_) this instrument is scarlet. Rimbaud calls the letter ‘a’\r\nblack. Persons whom Suarez mentions heard this vowel as blue, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the external world and the organism is originally\r\nvery simple. Movements are continually occurring in nature, and the\r\nprotoplasm of living cells perceives these movements. Unity of effect\r\ncorresponds to unity of cause. The lowest animals perceive of the\r\nouter world only this, that something in it changes, and possibly,\r\nalso, whether this change is marked or slight, sudden or slow. They\r\nreceive sensations differing quantitatively, but not qualitatively.\r\nWe know, for example, that the proboscis, or syphon, of the _Pholas\r\ndactylus_, which contracts more or less vigorously and quickly at\r\nevery excitation, is sensitive to all external impressions--light,\r\nnoise, touch, smell, etc. This mollusc sees, hears, feels and smells,\r\ntherefore, with this simple organ; his proboscis is to him at once\r\neye, ear, nose, finger, etc. In the higher animals the protoplasm\r\nis differentiated. Nerves, ganglia, brain and sense-apparatus are\r\nformed. The movements of nature are now perceived in a variety of\r\nways. The differentiated senses transform the unity of the phenomenon\r\ninto the diversity of the percept. But even in the highest and most\r\ndifferentiated brain there still remains something like a very\r\ndistant and very dim remembrance that the cause which excites the\r\ndifferent senses is one and the same movement, and there are formed\r\npresentations and conceptions which would be unintelligible if we\r\ncould not concede this vague intuition of the fundamental unity of\r\nessence in all perceptions. We speak of ‘high’ and ‘deep’ tones, and\r\nthus give to sound-waves a relationship in space which they cannot\r\nhave. In the same way we speak of tone-colour, and, conversely, of\r\ncolour-tones, and thus confound the acoustic and optic properties of\r\nthe phenomena. ‘Hard’ and ‘soft’ lines or tones, ‘sweet’ voices, are\r\nfrequent modes of expression, which depend on a transference of the\r\nperception of one sense to the impressions of another. In many cases\r\nthis method of speech may no doubt be traced to mental inertia. It is\r\nmore convenient to designate a sense-perception by a word which is\r\nfamiliar, though borrowed from the province of another sense, than to\r\ncreate a special word for the particular percept. But even this loan\r\nfor convenience’ sake is possible and intelligible only if we admit\r\nthat the mind perceives certain resemblances between the impressions of\r\nthe different senses--resemblances which, although they are often to be\r\nexplained by conscious or unconscious association of ideas, are oftener\r\nquite inexplicable objectively. It only remains for us to assume that\r\nconsciousness, in its deepest substrata, neglects the differentiation\r\nof phenomena by the various senses, passes over this perfection\r\nattained very late in organic evolution, and treats impressions only\r\nas undifferentiated material for the acquirement of knowledge of the\r\nexternal world without reference to their origin by way of this or\r\nthat sense. It thus becomes intelligible that the mind mingles the\r\nperceptions attained through the different senses, and transforms them\r\none into another. Binet[150] has established, in his excellent essays,\r\nthis transposition of the senses in hysterical persons. A female\r\npatient, whose skin was perfectly insensible on one half of her body,\r\ntook no notice when, unseen by herself, she was pricked with a needle.\r\nBut at the moment of puncture there arose in her consciousness the\r\nimage of a black (in the case of another invalid, of a bright) point.\r\nConsciousness thus transposed an impression of the nerves of the skin,\r\nwhich, as such, was not perceived, into an impression of the retina, of\r\nthe optic nerve.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is an evidence of diseased and debilitated\r\nbrain-activity, if consciousness relinquishes the advantages of the\r\ndifferentiated perceptions of phenomena, and carelessly confounds the\r\nreports conveyed by the particular senses. It is a retrogression to\r\nthe very beginning of organic development. It is a descent from the\r\nheight of human perfection to the low level of the mollusc. To raise\r\nthe combination, transposition and confusion of the perceptions of\r\nsound and sight to the rank of a principle of art, to see futurity\r\nin this principle, is to designate as progress the return from the\r\nconsciousness of man to that of the oyster.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is an old clinical observation that mental decay is\r\naccompanied by colour mysticism. One of Legrain’s[151] mental\r\ninvalids ‘endeavoured to recognise good and evil by the difference of\r\ncolour, ascending from white to black; when he was reading, words had\r\n(according to their colour) a hidden meaning, which he understood.’\r\nLombroso[152] cites ‘eccentric persons’ who, ‘like Wigman, had the\r\npaper for their books specially manufactured with several colours\r\non each page.... Filon painted each page of the books he wrote in a\r\ndifferent colour.’ Barbey d’Aurevilly, whom the Symbolists venerate as\r\na pioneer, used to write epistles in which each letter of a word was\r\ncoloured with a different tint. Most alienists know similar cases in\r\ntheir experience.\r\n\r\nThe more reliable Symbolists proclaim their movement as ‘a reaction\r\nagainst naturalism.’ Such a reaction was certainly justified and\r\nnecessary; for naturalism in its beginnings, as long as it was embodied\r\nin De Goncourt and Zola, was morbid, and, in its later development in\r\nthe hands of their imitators, vulgar and even criminal, as will be\r\nproved further on. Nevertheless Symbolism is not in the smallest degree\r\nqualified to conquer naturalism, because it is still more morbid than\r\nthe latter, and, in art, the devil cannot be driven out by Beelzebub.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is affirmed that Symbolism connotes ‘the inscribing of\r\na symbol in human form.’ Expressed unmystically, this means that in\r\nthe poems of the Symbolists the particular human form should not only\r\nexhibit its special nature and contingent destiny, but also represent\r\na general type of humanity, and embody a universal law of life. This\r\nquality, however, is not the monopoly of Symbolistic poetry, but\r\nbelongs to all kinds of poetry. No genuine poet has yet been impelled\r\nto deal with an utterly unprecedented and unique case, or with a\r\nmonstrous being whose likeness is not to be found in mankind. That\r\nwhich interests him in men and their destiny is just the intimate\r\nconnection between the two and the universal laws of human life. The\r\nmore the government of universal laws is made apparent in the fate of\r\nthe individual, the more there is embodied in him that which lives in\r\nall men, so much the more attractive will this destiny and this man be\r\nto the poet. There is not in all the literature of humanity a single\r\nwork of recognised importance which in this sense is not symbolic,\r\nand in which the characters, their passions and fortunes, have not a\r\ntypical significance, far transcending the particular circumstances.\r\nIt is, therefore, a piece of foolish arrogance in the Symbolists to\r\nlay claim to the sole possession of this quality in the works of their\r\nschool. They show, moreover, that they do not understand their own\r\nformulæ; for those theorists of the school who demand of poetry that it\r\nshould be ‘a symbol inscribed in human form,’ assert at the same time\r\nthat only the ‘rare and unique case’ (_le cas rare et unique_) deserves\r\nthe attention of the poet, _i.e._, the case which is significant of\r\nnothing beyond itself, and consequently the opposite of a symbol.[153]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that Symbolism, like English pre-Raphaelitism (from\r\nwhich it borrowed its catch-words and opinions), is nothing else\r\nthan a form of the mysticism of weak-minded and morbidly emotional\r\ndegeneration. The efforts of some followers of the movement to import\r\na meaning into the stammering utterances of their leaders, and falsely\r\nto ascribe to them a sort of programme, do not for a moment withstand\r\ncriticism, but show themselves to be graphomaniac and delirious\r\ntwaddle, without the smallest grain of truth or sound reason. A young\r\nFrenchman, who is certainly not adverse to rational innovation, Hugues\r\nLe Roux,[154] describes the group of Symbolists quite correctly in\r\nsaying of them: ‘They are ridiculous cripples, each intolerable to the\r\nother; they live uncomprehended by the public, several by their friends\r\nas well, and a few by themselves. As poets or prose writers they\r\nproceed in the same way: no material, no sense, and only juxtapositions\r\nof loud-sounding musical (?) words; teams of strange rhymes, groupings\r\nof unexpected colours and tones, swaying cadences, hurtlings,\r\nhallucinations and evoked suggestions.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTOLSTOISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT LEO TOLSTOI has become in the last few years one of the\r\nbest-known, and apparently, also, of the most widely-read authors in\r\nthe world. Every one of his words awakens an echo among all civilized\r\nnations on the globe. His strong influence over his contemporaries is\r\nunmistakable. But it is no artistic influence. No one has yet imitated\r\nhim--at least, for the present. He has formed no school after the\r\nmanner of the pre-Raphaelites and Symbolists. The already large number\r\nof writings to which he has given occasion are explanatory or critical.\r\nThere are no poetical creations modelled upon his own. The influence\r\nwhich he exercises over contemporary thoughts and feelings is a moral\r\none, and applies far more to the great bulk of his readers than to the\r\nsmaller circle of struggling authors who are on the look-out for a\r\nleader. What we, then, can call Tolstoism is no æsthetic theory, but\r\nrather a conception of life.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring forward the proof that Tolstoism is a mental\r\naberration, that it is a form of the phenomenon of degeneration, it\r\nwill be necessary to look critically first at Tolstoi himself, and then\r\nat the public which is inspired by his thoughts.\r\n\r\nTolstoi is at once a poet and a philosopher, the latter in the widest\r\nsense--_i.e._, he is a theologian, a moralist, and a social theorist.\r\nAs the author of works of imagination he stands very high, even if he\r\ndoes not equal his countryman Tourgenieff, whom he at present appears\r\nin the estimation of most people to have thrown into the shade.\r\nTolstoi does not possess the splendid sense of artistic proportion of\r\nTourgenieff, with whom there is never a word too much, who neither\r\nprotracts his subject nor digresses from his point, and who, as a\r\ngrand and genuine creator of men, stands Prometheus-like over the\r\nfigures he has inspired with life. Even Tolstoi’s greatest admirers\r\nadmit that he is long-winded, loses himself in details, and does not\r\nalways know how to sacrifice the unessential in order, with sure\r\njudgment, to enhance the indispensable. Speaking of the novel _War\r\nand Peace_, M. de Vogüé[155] says: ‘Is this complicated work properly\r\nto be termed a novel?... The very simple and very loose thread of the\r\nplot serves to connect chapters on history, politics, philosophy,\r\nwhich are all crammed promiscuously into this polygraphy of Russian\r\nlife.... Enjoyment has here to be purchased in a manner resembling a\r\nmountain ascent. The way is often wearisome and hard; at times one\r\ngoes astray; effort is necessary and toil.... Those who only seek\r\ndiversion in fiction are by Tolstoi driven from their wonted ways.\r\nThis close analyst does not know, or else disdains, the first duty of\r\nanalysis, which is so natural to the French genius; we desire that the\r\nnovelist should select; that he should set apart a person, a fact, out\r\nof the chaos of beings and things, in order to observe the objects\r\nof his choice. The Russian, governed by the feeling of universal\r\ninterdependence, cannot make up his mind to cut the thousand cords\r\nwhich unite a man, a fact, a thought, to the whole course of the world.’\r\n\r\nVogüé sees rightly that these facts are deserving of notice, but he\r\ncannot explain them. Unconsciously he has clearly characterized the\r\nmethod with which a mystical degenerate looks upon the world, and\r\ndepicts its phenomena. We know that it is lack of attention which\r\nconstitutes the peculiarity of mystical thought. It is attention which\r\nselects from the chaos of phenomena, and so groups what it selects as\r\nto illustrate the predominating thought in the mind of the beholder.\r\nIf attention fails, the world appears to the beholder like a uniform\r\nstream of enigmatic states, which emerge and disappear without any\r\nconnection, and remain completely without expression to consciousness.\r\nThese primary facts of mental life must ever be kept in view by the\r\nreader. The attitude of the attentive man in the face of external\r\nphenomena is one of activity; that of the inattentive man is passive;\r\nthe former orders them according to a plan which he has worked out in\r\nhis mind; the latter receives the turmoil of their impress without\r\nattempting to organize, separate, or co-ordinate. The difference is\r\nthe same as that between the reproduction of the scenes of nature by a\r\ngood painter and a photographic plate. The painting suppresses certain\r\nfeatures in the world’s phenomena, and brings others into prominence,\r\nso that it at once permits a distinct external incident, or a definite\r\ninternal emotion of the painter, to be recognised. The photograph\r\nreflects the whole scene with all its details indiscriminately, so\r\nthat it is without meaning, until the beholder brings into play his\r\nattention, which the sensitive plate could not do. At the same time it\r\nis to be observed that even the photograph is not a true impression\r\nof reality, for the sensitive plate is only sensitive to certain\r\ncolours; it records the blue and violet, and receives from yellow and\r\nred either a weak impression or none at all. The sensitiveness of\r\nthe chemical plate corresponds to the emotionalism of the degenerate\r\nmind. The latter also makes a choice among phenomena, not, however,\r\naccording to the laws of conscious attention, but according to the\r\nimpulse of unconscious emotionalism. He perceives whatever is in tune\r\nwith his emotions; what is not consonant with them does not exist for\r\nhim. Thus arises the method of work which Vogüé has pointed out in\r\nTolstoi’s novels. The details are perceived equally, and placed side\r\nby side, not according to their importance for the leading idea, but\r\naccording to their relation with the emotions of the novelist. For that\r\nmatter, there is scarcely any leading idea, or none at all. The reader\r\nmust first carry it into the novel, as he would carry it into Nature\r\nherself, into a landscape, into a crowd of people, into the course of\r\nevents. The novel is only written because the novelist felt certain\r\nstrong emotions, and certain features of the world’s panorama as it\r\nunrolled before his eyes intensified these emotions. Thus, the novel\r\nof Tolstoi resembles the picture of the pre-Raphaelites: an abundance\r\nof amazingly accurate details,[156] a mystically blurred, scarcely\r\nrecognisable, leading idea,[157] a deep and strong emotion.[158] This\r\nis also distinctly felt by M. de Vogüé, but again without his being\r\nable to explain it. He says:[159] ‘Through a peculiar and frequent\r\ncontradiction, this troubled, vacillating mind, steeped as it is in the\r\nmists of Nihilism, is endowed with an incomparable clearness and power\r\nof penetration for the scientific (?) study of the phenomena of life.\r\nHe sees distinctly, rapidly, analytically, everything on earth.... One\r\nmight say, the mind of an English chemist in the soul of an Indian\r\nBuddhist. Let anyone who can explain this singular union; whoever\r\nsucceeds will be able to explain Russia.... These phenomena, which\r\noffer so firm a basis to him when he observes them singly, he wishes\r\nto know in their universal relations, and to arrive at the definite\r\nlaws governing these relations, and at their inaccessible causes. Then\r\nit is that this clear vision darkens, the intrepid inquirer loses his\r\nfooting, he falls into the abyss of philosophical contradictions; in\r\nhim and around him he feels only nothingness and night.’\r\n\r\nM. de Vogüé wishes for an explanation of this ‘singular union’ between\r\ngreat clearness in apprehension of details, and complete incapacity of\r\nunderstanding their relations to each other. The explanation is now\r\nfamiliar to my readers. The mystical intellect, the intellect without\r\nattention, of the _émotif_ conveys to his consciousness isolated\r\nimpressions, which can be very distinct if they relate to his emotions;\r\nbut it is not in the condition to connect these isolated impressions\r\nintelligibly, just because it is deficient in the attention necessary\r\nto this object.\r\n\r\nGrand as are the qualities which Tolstoi’s works of fiction possess, it\r\nis not them he has to thank for his world-wide fame, or his influence\r\non his contemporaries. His novels were recognised as remarkable works,\r\nbut for decades of years neither _Peace and War_, nor _Anna Karenina_,\r\nnor his short stories, had very many readers outside Russia; and the\r\ncritics bestowed upon their author only a guarded commendation. In\r\nGermany, as recently as 1882, Franz Bornmüller said of Tolstoi in his\r\n_Biographical Dictionary of Authors of the Present Time_: ‘He possesses\r\nno ordinary talent for fiction, but one devoid of due artistic finish,\r\nand which is influenced by a certain one-sidedness in his views of life\r\nand history.’ This was the opinion until a few years ago of the not\r\nvery numerous non-Russian readers who knew him at all.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 his _Kreutzer Sonata_ appeared, and was the first of his\r\nworks to carry his name to the borders of civilization. This little\r\ntale was the first to be translated into all cultivated languages. It\r\nwas disseminated in hundreds of thousands of copies, and was read by\r\nmillions with lively emotion. From this time onward the public opinion\r\nof the Western nations placed him in the first rank of living authors:\r\nhis name was in everyone’s mouth, and universal sympathy turned not\r\nonly towards his early writings (which had remained unnoticed for\r\ndecades), but also to his person and his career, and he became, as it\r\nwere, in a night what he unquestionably is now in the evening of his\r\nlife--one of the chief representative figures of the departing century.\r\nYet the _Kreutzer Sonata_ stands, as a poetic creation, not so high\r\nas most of his older works. A fame which was not gained by _War and\r\nPeace_, _The Cossacks_, _Anna Karenina_, etc., nor, indeed, until long\r\nafter the appearance of these rich creations, but came at one stroke\r\nthrough the _Kreutzer Sonata_, cannot therefore depend either solely\r\nor principally on æsthetic excellence. The history of this fame shows\r\nconsequently that Tolstoi the novelist is not the cause of Tolstoism.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the tendency of mind so named is far more--perhaps wholly and\r\nentirely--traceable to Tolstoi the philosopher. The philosopher is,\r\ntherefore, incomparably more important to our inquiry than the novelist.\r\n\r\nTolstoi has formed certain views on the position of man in the world,\r\non his relation to collective humanity, and on the aim of his life,\r\nwhich are visible in all his creations, but which he has also set forth\r\nconnectedly in several theoretic works, especially in _My Confession_,\r\n_My Faith_, _A Short Exposition of the Gospel_, and _About my Life_.\r\nThese views are but little complicated, and can be condensed in a\r\nfew words: the individual is nothing; the species is everything; the\r\nindividual lives in order to do his fellow-creatures good; thought and\r\ninquiry are great evils; science is perdition; faith is salvation.\r\n\r\nHow he arrived at these results is related in _My Confessions_: ‘I lost\r\nmy faith early. I lived for a long time like everyone else, in the\r\nfrivolities of life. I wrote books, and taught, like everyone else,\r\nwhat I did not know. Then the Sphinx began to follow me more and more\r\nruthlessly: “Guess my problem or I will tear thee to pieces.” Science\r\nhas explained absolutely nothing to me. In answer to my everlasting\r\nquestion, the only one which means anything, “Wherefore am I alive?”\r\nScience replied by teaching me things that were indifferent to me.\r\nScience only said ...: “Life is a senseless evil.” I wanted to kill\r\nmyself. Finally I had a fancy to see how the vast majority of men lived\r\nwho, unlike us of the so-called upper classes, who give ourselves up to\r\npondering and investigation, work and suffer, and are, nevertheless,\r\nquiet and clear in their minds over the aim of life. I understood that\r\nto live like these men one must return to their simple beliefs.’\r\n\r\nIf this train of thought is seriously considered, it will be recognised\r\nat once as nonsensical. The question, ‘Wherefore am I alive?’ is\r\nincorrectly and superficially put. It tacitly presupposes the idea of\r\nfinality in nature, and it is just upon this presupposition that the\r\nmind, thirsting earnestly for truth and knowledge, has to exercise its\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nIn order to ask, ‘What is the aim of our life?’ we must take for\r\ngranted, above all, that our life has a definite aim, and since it is\r\nonly a particular phenomenon in the universal life of nature, in the\r\nevolution of our earth, of our solar system, of all solar systems,\r\nthis assumption includes in itself the wider one, that the universal\r\nlife of Nature has a definite aim. This assumption, again, necessarily\r\npresupposes the rule of a conscious, prescient, and guiding mind over\r\nthe universe. For what is an aim? The fore-ordained effect in the\r\nfuture of forces active in the present. The aim exercises an influence\r\non these forces in pointing out to them a direction, and is thus itself\r\na force. It cannot, however, exist objectively, in time and space,\r\nbecause then it would cease to be an aim and become a cause, _i.e._, a\r\nforce fitting in with the general mechanism of the forces of nature,\r\nand all the speculation concerning the aim would fall to the ground.\r\nBut if it is not objective, if it does not exist in time and space, it\r\nmust, in order to be conceivable, exist somewhere, virtually, as idea,\r\nas a plan and design. But that which contains a design, a thought, a\r\nplan, we name consciousness; and a consciousness that can conceive\r\na plan of the universe, and for its realization designedly uses the\r\nforces of nature, is synonymous with God. If a man, however, believes\r\nin a God, he loses at once the right to raise the question, ‘Wherefore\r\nam I alive?’ Since it is in that case an insolent presumption, an\r\neffort of small, weak man to look over God’s shoulder, to spy out God’s\r\nplan, to aspire to the height of omniscience. But neither is it in such\r\na case necessary, since a God without the highest wisdom cannot be\r\nconceived, and if He has devised a plan for the world, this is certain\r\nto be perfect, all its parts are in harmony, and the aim to which every\r\nco-operator, from the smallest to the greatest, will devote himself\r\nis the best conceivable. Thus, man can live in complete rest and\r\nconfidence in the impulses and forces implanted in him by God, because\r\nhe, in every case, fulfils a high and worthy destiny by co-operating in\r\na, to him, unknown Divine plan of the world.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, there is no belief in a God, it is also\r\nimpossible to form a conception of the aim, for then the aim, existing\r\nin consciousness only as an idea, in the absence of a universal\r\nconsciousness, has no locus for its existence; there is no place\r\nfor it in Nature. But if there is no aim, then one cannot ask the\r\nquestion, ‘Wherefore am I alive?’ Then life has not a predetermined\r\naim, but only causes. We have then to concern ourselves only with these\r\ncauses--at least, with the more proximate, and which are accessible to\r\nour examination, since the remote, and especially the first, causes\r\nelude our cognition. Our question must then run, ‘Why do we live?’\r\nand we find the answer to it without difficulty. We live, because we\r\nstand, like the rest of cognizable Nature, under the universal law of\r\ncausality. This is a mechanical law, which requires no predetermined\r\nplan, and no design, consequently also no universal consciousness.\r\nAccording to this law present phenomena are grounded on the past,\r\nnot on the future. We live because we are engendered by our parents,\r\nbecause we have received from them a definite measure of force, which\r\nmakes it possible for us to resist for a given time the influence\r\nupon us of Nature’s forces of dissolution. How our life is shaped is\r\ndetermined by the constant interaction of our inherited organic forces\r\nand of our environment. Our life is, therefore, objectively viewed,\r\nthe necessary result of the law-governed activity of the mechanical\r\nforces of Nature. Subjectively it includes a quantity of pleasures and\r\npains. We feel as pleasure the satisfaction of our organic impulses, as\r\npain their fruitless struggles for satisfaction. In a sound organism,\r\npossessing a high capacity for adaptation, those appetites only attain\r\ndevelopment, the satisfaction of which is possible--at least, to a\r\ncertain degree--and is accompanied by no bad consequences for the\r\nindividual. In such a life pleasure consequently prevails decidedly\r\nover pain, and he looks upon existence, not as an evil, but as a great\r\ngood. In the organism deranged by disease degenerate appetites exist\r\nwhich cannot be satisfied, or of which the gratification injures\r\nor destroys the individual, or the degenerate organism is too weak\r\nor too inapt to gratify the legitimate impulses. In his life pain\r\nnecessarily predominates, and he looks upon existence as an evil.\r\nMy interpretation of the riddle of life is nearly related to the\r\nwell-known theory of eudæmonism, but it is founded on a biological,\r\nnot a metaphysical, basis. It explains optimism and pessimism simply\r\nas an adequate or inadequate vitality, as the existence or absence of\r\nadaptability, as health or illness. Unprejudiced observation of life\r\nshows that the whole of mankind stands knowingly or unknowingly at the\r\nsame philosophical standpoint. Men live willingly, and rather quietly\r\nhappy than sadly, so long as existence affords them gratification. If\r\nthe sufferings are stronger than the feeling of pleasure conferred\r\nby the satisfaction of the first and most important of all organic\r\nimpulses--the impulse of life or self-preservation--then they do not\r\nhesitate to kill themselves. When Prince Bismarck once said, ‘I do\r\nnot know why I should bear all the troubles of life, if I were not\r\nable to believe in a God and a future life,’ it only shows that he is\r\ninsufficiently acquainted with the progress of human thought since\r\nHamlet, who raised somewhat the same question. He bears the troubles\r\nof life because, and as long as, he can bear them, and he throws them\r\ndown infallibly at the moment in which his strength is no longer\r\nadequate to carry them. The unbeliever lives and is happy, so long as\r\nthe sweets of life weigh down the scale, and for this reason also the\r\nbeliever, as experience daily teaches, will commit suicide if he sees\r\nhis balance of life’s account yielding a deficit of satisfaction. The\r\narguments of religion have undoubtedly in the mind of the believer, as\r\nhave the arguments of duty and honour in the mind of the unbeliever, a\r\nconvincing force, and must likewise be taken into account as so many\r\nassets. Nevertheless they have only a limited, if high value, and can\r\ncounterbalance their own equivalent of suffering only, and no more.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it follows that the terrible\r\nquestion--‘Wherefore am I alive?’--which nearly drove Tolstoi to\r\nsuicide, is to be answered satisfactorily and without difficulty. The\r\nbeliever, who accepts the fact that his life must have an aim, will\r\nlive according to his inclinations and powers, and tell himself that he\r\nperforms correctly, in this way, his allotted portion of the world’s\r\nwork without knowing its final aim; as also a soldier, at that point\r\nof the field of battle where he is placed, does his duty willingly,\r\nwithout having any notion of the general progress of the fight, and\r\nof its significance for the whole campaign. The unbeliever, who is\r\nconvinced that his life is a particular instance of the universal\r\nlife of Nature, that his individuality has blossomed into existence\r\nas a necessary law-governed operation of eternal organic forces,\r\nknows also very well not only ‘wherefore,’ but also ‘what for,’ he is\r\nalive; he lives because, and as long as, life is to him a source of\r\ngratification--that is to say, of joy and happiness.\r\n\r\nHas Tolstoi found any other answer by his desperate seeking? No. The\r\nexplanation which his pondering and searching did not offer him was,\r\nas we have seen in the above-quoted passage in _My Confessions_, given\r\nhim by ‘the enormous majority of mankind, who ... labour and suffer,\r\nand, nevertheless, are quiet and clear in their minds as to the aim\r\nof life.’ ‘I understood,’ he adds, ‘that one must return to their\r\nsimple faith to live as these men do.’ The conclusion is arbitrary,\r\nand is a _saltum_ of mystic thought. ‘The masses live quietly, and are\r\nclear in their minds as to the aim of life,’ not because they have\r\na ‘simple faith,’ but because they are healthy, because they like\r\nto feel themselves alive, because life gives them, in every organic\r\nfunction, in every manifestation of their powers, at every moment,\r\nsome gratification. The ‘simple faith’ is the accidental accompanying\r\nphenomenon of this natural optimism. No doubt the majority of the\r\nuneducated classes, who represent the healthy portion of mankind,\r\nand therefore certainly rejoice in life, receive, during childhood,\r\ninstruction in religious faith, and afterwards only rarely rectify\r\nthrough their own thought the errors which, for state reasons, have\r\nbeen imparted to them; but their unthinking belief is a consequence\r\nof their poverty and ignorance, like their bad clothing, insufficient\r\nfood, and insanitary dwellings. To say that the majority ‘live quietly,\r\nand are clear in their minds as to the aim of life,’ because they ‘have\r\nsimple faith,’ is quite as logical a sequitur as the assertion that\r\nthis majority ‘live quietly, and are clear in their minds as to the aim\r\nof life’ because they chiefly eat potatoes, or because they live in\r\ncellars, or because they seldom take baths.\r\n\r\nTolstoi has rightly noticed the fact that the majority do not share\r\nhis pessimism, and rejoice in their life, but he has explained it\r\nmystically. Instead of recognising that the optimism of the masses is\r\nsimply a sign of their vitality, he traces it to their belief, and\r\nthen seeks in faith the clue to the aim of his existence. ‘I was led\r\nto Christianity,’ he writes in another book,[160] ‘neither through\r\ntheological nor historical research, but by the circumstance that\r\nwhen, at fifty years of age, I asked myself and the wise among my\r\nacquaintance what myself and my life might signify, and received the\r\nanswer: “You are an accidental concatenation of parts; there is no\r\nsignificance in life; life as such is an evil.”--I was then brought\r\nto despair, and wished to kill myself. Remembering, however, that\r\nformerly, in childhood, when I believed, life had a meaning for me,\r\nand that the people about me who believe--the greater number being men\r\nunspoilt by riches--both believe and lead real lives, I doubted the\r\naccuracy of the answer which had been given me by the wisdom of my\r\ncircle, and endeavoured to understand that answer which Christianity\r\ngives to men who lead a real life.’[161]\r\n\r\nHe found this answer ‘in the Gospels, that source of light.’ ‘It was\r\nquite the same thing to me,’ he goes on to say, ‘whether Jesus was\r\nGod or not God; whether the Holy Ghost proceeded from the one or the\r\nother. It was likewise neither necessary nor important for me to know\r\nwhen and by whom the Gospel, or any one of the parables, was composed,\r\nand whether they could be ascribed to Christ or not. What to me was\r\nimportant was that Light, which for eighteen hundred years was the\r\nLight of the World, and is that Light still, but what name was to be\r\ngiven to the source of this Light, or what were its component parts,\r\nand by whom it was lighted, was quite indifferent to me.’\r\n\r\nLet us appraise this process of thought in a mystical mind. The\r\nGospel is the source of truth; it is, however, quite the same thing\r\nwhether the Gospel is God’s revelation or man’s work, and whether it\r\ncontains the genuine tradition of the life of Christ, or whether it\r\nwas written down hundreds of years after his death on the basis of\r\nobscured and distorted traditions. Tolstoi himself feels that he here\r\nmakes a great error of thought, but he deceives himself over and out\r\nof it in genuine mystical fashion, in that he makes use of a simile,\r\nand pretends that his image was the matter-of-fact truth. He speaks,\r\nnamely, of the Gospel as a light, and says it is indifferent to him\r\nwhat that light is called, and of what it consists. This is correct if\r\nit concerns a real, material light, but the Gospel is only figuratively\r\na light, and can obviously, therefore, be compared to a light only if\r\nit contains the truth. Whether it does contain the truth should first\r\nbe decided by inquiry. Should inquiry result in establishing that it\r\nis man’s work, and consists only in unauthenticated traditions, then\r\nit would evidently be no receptacle of truth, and one could not any\r\nlonger compare it with light, and the magnificent image with which\r\nTolstoi cuts short inquiry into the source of the light would vanish\r\ninto air. While, therefore, Tolstoi calls the Gospel a light, and\r\ndenies the necessity of following up its origin, he forthwith takes as\r\nproven the very thing which is to be proved, namely, that the Gospel\r\nis a light. We know already, however, the peculiarity of mystics to\r\nfound all their conclusions on the most senseless premises, alleging\r\ncontempt of reality and resisting all reasonable verification of their\r\nstarting-point. I only remind the reader of Rossetti’s sentence, ‘What\r\ndoes it matter to me whether the sun revolves round the earth, or the\r\nearth round the sun?’ and of Mallarmé’s expression, ‘The world is made\r\nin order to lead to a beautiful book.’\r\n\r\nOne can read for one’s self in his _Short Exposition_ how Tolstoi\r\nhandles the Gospel, so that it may give him the required explanation.\r\nHe does not trouble himself in the least about the literal sense of\r\nthe Scriptures, but puts into them what is in his own head. The Gospel\r\nwhich he has so recast has about as much resemblance to the canonical\r\nScriptures as the _Physiognomische Fragmente_, which Jean Paul’s\r\n‘merry little schoolmaster, Maria Wuz in Auenthal,’ ‘drew out of his\r\nown head,’ had with Lavater’s work of the same title. This Gospel of\r\nhis taught him concerning the importance of life as follows:[162] ‘Men\r\nimagine that they are isolated beings, each one shaping his own life\r\nas he wills. This, however, is a delusion. The only true life is that\r\nwhich acknowledges the will of the Father as the source of life. This\r\nunity of life my teaching reveals, and represents that life, not as\r\nseparate shoots, but as a single tree on which all the shoots grow. He\r\nonly who lives in the will of the Father, like a shoot on the tree,\r\nhas life; but he who would live according to his own will, like a\r\nsevered shoot, dies.’ He has already said that the Father is synonymous\r\nwith God, and that God, who ‘is the eternal origin of all things,’\r\nis synonymous with ‘Spirit.’ If, then, this passage has any sense at\r\nall, it can only be that the whole of Nature is a single living being,\r\nthat every single living being, therefore also every human being, is a\r\nportion of universal life, and that this universal life is God. This\r\nteaching is, however, not invented by Tolstoi. It has a name in the\r\nhistory of philosophy, and is called Pantheism. It is shadowed forth in\r\nBuddhism[163] and Greek Hylozoism, and was elaborated by Spinoza. It\r\nis certainly not contained in the Gospel, and it is a definite denial\r\nof Christianity which, let its dogmas be ever so rationalistically\r\ninterpreted and tortured, can never give up its doctrine of a personal\r\nGod and the Divine nature of Christ without ridding itself of its whole\r\nreligious import and its vitally important organs, and ceasing to be a\r\ncreed.\r\n\r\nThus we see that, though Tolstoi supposes he has succeeded in his\r\nattempt to explain life’s problems by the Christian faith of the\r\nmasses, he has, on the contrary, fallen into its very opposite,\r\nnamely, Pantheism. The reply of the ‘wise,’ that he ‘is an accidental\r\nconcatenation of parts, and that there is no significance in life,’\r\n‘drove him almost to suicide’; he is, on the contrary, quite tranquil\r\nin the knowledge that[164] ‘the true life is ...not the life which is\r\npast, nor that which will be, but is the life which now is, that which\r\nconfronts everyone at the present minute’; he expressly denies in _My\r\nReligion_ the resurrection of the body and the individuality of the\r\nsoul, and does not notice that the teaching which contents him is quite\r\nthe same as that of the ‘wise,’ who ‘almost drove him into suicide.’\r\nFor if life exists only in the present, it can have no aim, since this\r\nwould refer to the future; and if the body does not rise again, and the\r\nsoul has no individual existence, then the ‘wise’ are quite right to\r\ncall the human being (certainly not accidental, but necessary, because\r\ncausally conditioned) ‘a concatenation of parts.’\r\n\r\nTolstoi’s theory of life, the fruit of the despairing mental labour\r\nof his whole life, is therefore, nothing but a haze, a failure to\r\ncomprehend his own questions and answers, and hollow verbiage. His\r\nethics--on which he himself lays a far greater stress than on his\r\nphilosophy--is not in much better case than the latter. He comprises\r\nthem[165] in five laws, of which the fourth is the most important: ‘Do\r\nnot resist evil; suffer wrong, and do more than men ask; and so judge\r\nnot, nor suffer to be judged....’ To avenge one’s self only teaches to\r\navenge one’s self. His admirer, M. de Vogüé, expresses Tolstoi’s moral\r\nphilosophy in this form:[166] ‘Resist not evil, judge not, kill not.\r\nConsequently no courts of justice, no armies, no prisons, no public\r\nor private reprisals. No wars nor judgments. The world’s law is the\r\nstruggle for existence; the law of Christ is the sacrifice of one’s own\r\nexistence for others.’\r\n\r\nIs it still necessary to point out the unreasonableness of these\r\nethics? It is obvious to sound common-sense without saying any more.\r\nIf the murderer had no longer to fear the gallows, and the thief the\r\nprison, throat-cutting and stealing would be soon by far the most\r\ngenerally adopted trade. It is so much more convenient to filch baked\r\nbread and ready-made boots than to rack one’s self at the plough and in\r\nthe workshop. If society should cease to take care that crime should\r\nbe a dangerous risk, what would there be, forsooth, to deter wicked\r\nmen, who certainly exist, according to Tolstoi’s assumption, from\r\nsurrendering themselves to their basest impulses; and how could the\r\ngreat mass of indifferent people be restrained, who have no pronounced\r\nleaning either for good or for evil, from imitating the example of the\r\ncriminal? Certainly not Tolstoi’s own teaching that ‘the true life is\r\nlife in the present.’ The first active measures of society, for the\r\nsake of which individuals originally formed themselves into a society,\r\nis the protection of their members against those who are diseased\r\nwith homicidal mania, and against the parasites--another unhealthy\r\nvariation from the normal human type--who can only live by the work of\r\nothers, and who, to appease all their lusts, unscrupulously overpower\r\nevery human being who crosses their path. Individuals with anti-social\r\nimpulses would soon be in the majority if the healthy members did not\r\nsubdue them, and make it difficult for them to thrive. Were they once\r\nto become the stronger, society, and soon mankind itself, would of a\r\nnecessity be devoted to destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the negative precept that one should not resist evil,\r\nTolstoi’s moral philosophy has yet a positive precept, viz.: we ought\r\nto love all men; to sacrifice everything, even one’s own life, for\r\nthem; to do good to them where we can. ‘It is necessary to understand\r\nthat man, if he does good, only does that to which he is bound--what\r\nhe cannot leave undone.... If he gives up his carnal life for the\r\ngood, he does nothing for which he need be thanked and praised....\r\nOnly those live who do good’ (_Short Exposition of the Gospel_). ‘Not\r\nis alms-giving effectual, but brotherly sharing. Whoever has two\r\ncloaks should give one to him who has none’ (_What ought one to Do?_).\r\nThis distinction between charity and sharing cannot be maintained in\r\nearnest. Every gift that a man receives from some other man without\r\nwork, without reciprocal service, is an alms, and as such is deeply\r\nimmoral. The sick, the old, the weak, those who cannot work, must be\r\nsupported and tended by their fellow-creatures; it is their duty,\r\nand it is also their natural impulse. But to give to men capable of\r\nworking is under all circumstances a sin and a self-deception. If men\r\ncapable of work find no work, this is obviously attributable to some\r\ndefect in the economical structure of society; and it is the duty of\r\neach individual to assist earnestly in removing this defect, but not\r\nto facilitate its continuance by pacifying for awhile the victim of\r\nthe defective circumstances by a gift. Charity has in this case merely\r\nthe aim of deadening the conscience of the donor, and furnishing him\r\nwith an excuse why he should shirk his duty of curing recognised evils\r\nin the constitution of society. Should, however, the capable man be\r\naverse to labour, then charity spoils him completely, and kills in\r\nhim entirely any inclination to put his powers into action, which\r\nalone keeps the organism healthy and moral. Thus alms, extended to\r\nan able-bodied man, degrades both the donor and the recipient, and\r\noperates like poison on the feeling of duty and the morality of both.\r\n\r\nBut the love of our neighbour which exhibits itself in alms-giving,\r\nor even brotherly sharing, is, properly speaking, no such love if\r\nwe look at it closely. Love in its simplest and most original form\r\n(I speak here not of sexual love, but of general sympathy for some\r\nother living being, and that need not even be a human being) is a\r\nselfish impulse, which seeks only its own gratification, not that of\r\nthe beloved being; in its higher development, on the contrary, it\r\nis principally, or wholly, bent upon the happiness of the beloved\r\nbeing, and forgets itself. The healthy man, who has no anti-social\r\nimpulses, enjoys the company of other men; he therefore avoids almost\r\nunconsciously those actions which would cause his fellow-creatures to\r\navoid him, and he does that which, without costing himself too much\r\neffort, is sufficiently pleasant to his fellows to attract them to him.\r\nIn the same healthy man the idea of sufferings, even when they are\r\nnot his own, produces pain, which is always greater or less according\r\nto the degree of excitability of his brain; the more active the idea\r\nof suffering, the more violent is the accompanying feeling of pain.\r\nBecause the ideas excited by direct sense-impressions are the most\r\nvivid, the sufferings which he sees with his own eyes cause him the\r\nsharpest pain, and in order to escape from this, he makes suitable\r\nefforts to put an end to this extraneous suffering, or often, it is\r\ntrue, only not to witness it. This degree of love to our neighbour is,\r\nas was said above, pure self-love; it merely aims at averting pain\r\nfrom self, and at increasing one’s own feelings of pleasure. The love\r\nof our neighbour, on the contrary, which Tolstoi obviously wishes to\r\npreach, claims to be unselfish. It contemplates the diminution of the\r\nsufferings, and the increase of the happiness, of others; it can no\r\nlonger be exercised instinctively, for it demands an exact knowledge of\r\nthe conditions of life, and the feelings and wishes of others, and the\r\nacquisition of this knowledge presupposes observation, reflection, and\r\njudgment. One must earnestly consider what is really needful and good\r\nfor one’s neighbour. One must come out of one’s self, must set aside\r\none’s own habits and ideas completely, and strive to slip into the\r\nskin of him to whom one would show love. One must regard the intended\r\nbenefit with the other’s eyes, and feel with his nature, and not with\r\none’s own. Does Tolstoi do this? His novels, in which he shows his\r\nalleged love between fellow-men living and working, prove the exact\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nIn the tale _Albert_[167] Delessow takes up a sickly, strolling\r\nviolin-player out of admiration for his great talent, and out of pity\r\nfor his poverty and helplessness. But the unhappy artist is a drunkard.\r\nDelessow locks him up in his dwelling, places him under the care of\r\nhis servant Sachar, and keeps him from intoxicating drinks. On the\r\nfirst day Albert the artist submits, but is very depressed and out of\r\ntemper. On the second day he is already casting ‘malignant glances’ at\r\nhis benefactor. ‘He seemed to fear Delessow, and whenever their eyes\r\nmet a deadly terror was depicted on his face.... He did not answer the\r\nquestions which were put to him.’ Finally, on the third day Albert\r\nrebels against the restraint to which he believes himself subjected.\r\n‘You have no right to shut me up here,’ he cries. ‘My passport is in\r\norder. I have stolen nothing from you; you can search me. I will go\r\nto the superintendent of police.’ The servant Sachar tries to appease\r\nhim. Albert becomes more and more enraged, and suddenly ‘shrieks out at\r\nthe top of his voice: “Police!”’ Delessow allows him to depart. Albert\r\n‘goes out of the door without taking leave, and constantly muttering to\r\nhimself incomprehensible words.’\r\n\r\nDelessow had taken Albert home, because the sight was painful to him\r\nof the poorly-clad, sickly, pale artist, trembling in the cold of a\r\nRussian winter. When he saw him in his warm house, before a well-spread\r\ntable, in his own handsome dressing-gown, Delessow felt contented and\r\nhappy. But was Albert also contented? Tolstoi testifies that Albert\r\nfeels himself much more unhappy in the new position than in the old--so\r\nunhappy that very soon he could not bear it, and freed himself from it\r\nwith an outburst of fury. To whom, then, had Delessow done good, to\r\nhimself or to Albert?\r\n\r\nIn this narrative a mentally diseased man is depicted, and, it must\r\nbe admitted, upon such a one a benefit has frequently to be forcibly\r\npressed, which he does not understand or appreciate as such, though,\r\nof course, in a manner more consistent, persistent, and prudent than\r\nDelessow’s. In another story in the same volume, however, _From the\r\nDiary of the Prince Nechljudow, Lucerne_, the absurdity of love for\r\none’s fellow-creature which does not trouble itself about the real\r\nneeds of the fellow-creature is brought out more vividly and without\r\nany excuse.\r\n\r\nOne glorious evening in July, in front of the Schweizer-Hof, in\r\nLucerne, Prince Nechljudow heard a street-singer whose songs touched\r\nand enraptured him deeply. The singer is a poor, small, hump-backed\r\nman, insufficiently clad and looking half starved. On all the balconies\r\nof the sumptuous hotel rich Englishmen and their wives are standing;\r\nall have enjoyed the glorious singing of the poor cripple, but when he\r\ntakes off his hat and begs a small reward for his artistic performance,\r\nnot one person throws even the smallest coin to him. Nechljudow falls\r\ninto the most violent excitement. He is beside himself over the fact\r\nthat ‘the singer could beg three times for a gift, and no one gave him\r\nthe smallest thing, while the greater number laughed at him.’ It seems\r\nto him ‘an event which the historian of our times should inscribe in\r\nthe pages of history with indelible letters of fire.’ He, for his part,\r\nwill not be a participator in this unprecedented sin. He hastens after\r\nthe poor devil, overtakes him and invites him to drink a bottle of wine\r\nwith him. The singer accepts. ‘Close by is a small café,’ says he; ‘we\r\ncan go in there--it is a cheap one,’ he continued. ‘The words, “a cheap\r\none,” involuntarily suggested the idea,’ relates Nechljudow in his\r\ndiary, ‘not to go to a cheap cafe, but into the Schweizer-Hof, where\r\nwere the people who had listened to his singing. Although he refused\r\nthe Schweizer-Hof several times in timid agitation, because he thought\r\nit was much too grand there, I persisted in it.’\r\n\r\nHe leads the singer into the splendid hotel. Although he appears in the\r\ncompany of the princely guest, the servants look at the badly dressed\r\nvagabond with hostile and contemptuous glances. They show the pair into\r\nthe ‘saloon on the left, the drinking-bar for the people.’ The singer\r\nis very much embarrassed, and wishes himself far away, but he conceals\r\nhis feelings. The Prince orders champagne. The singer drinks without\r\nany real pleasure and without confidence. He talks about his life,\r\nand says suddenly: ‘I know what you wish. You want to make me drunk,\r\nand then see what can be got out of me.’ Nechljudow, annoyed by the\r\nscornful and insolent demeanour of the servants jumps up and goes with\r\nhis guest into the handsome dining-room on the right hand, which is set\r\napart for the visitors. He will be served here and nowhere else. The\r\nEnglish, who are present, indignantly leave the room; the waiters are\r\ndismayed, but do not venture to oppose the angry Russian Prince. ‘The\r\nsinger drew a very miserable, terrified face, and begged me, as soon as\r\npossible, to go away, evidently not understanding why I was angry and\r\nwhat I wished.’ The little mannikin ‘sat more dead than alive’ near the\r\nPrince, and was very happy when Nechljudow finally dismissed him.\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed how extremely absurdly Prince Nechljudow behaves\r\nfrom beginning to end. He invites the singer to a bottle of wine,\r\nalthough, if he had possessed the faintest glimmer of sound\r\ncommon-sense, he might have said to himself that a hot supper, or,\r\nstill better, a five-franc piece, would be far more necessary and\r\nuseful to the poor devil than a bottle of wine. The singer proposes to\r\ngo to a modest restaurant, where he himself would feel comfortable.\r\nThe Prince pays not the smallest attention to this natural, reasonable\r\ndesire, but drags the poor devil into a leading hotel, where he feels\r\nextremely uncomfortable in his bad clothing, under the cross-fire\r\nof the waiters’ insolent and scornful looks. The Prince does not\r\ncare about this, but orders champagne, to which the singer is not\r\naccustomed, and which gives him so little pleasure that the thought\r\noccurs to him that his noble host desires to make sport of him by\r\nseeing him drunk. Nechljudow begins to squabble with the waiters,\r\nproceeds to the finest saloon of the hotel, scares away the remaining\r\nguests, who do not desire to sit at supper with the street-singer,\r\nand does not concern himself during the whole of this time about the\r\nfeelings of his guest, who sits on hot coals, and would far rather\r\nsink into the floor, and who only breathes again when his terrible\r\nbenefactor lets him escape out of his fangs.\r\n\r\nDid Nechljudow exercise neighbourly love? No. He did nothing pleasant\r\nto the singer. He tormented him. He only satisfied himself. He wished\r\nto revenge himself on the hard-hearted English people, with whom he was\r\nfurious, and he did so at the expense of the poor devil. Nechljudow\r\ncalls it an unheard-of occurrence that the wealthy Englishmen should\r\ngive nothing to the singer, but what he did to the latter is worse.\r\nThe odious niggardliness of the English people annoyed the singer for\r\na quarter of an hour, perhaps; Nechljudow’s foolish entertainment\r\ntortured him for an hour. The Prince never took the trouble to\r\nconsider, even for a moment, what would be agreeable and useful to\r\nthe singer; he thought always of himself only, of his own feelings,\r\nhis anger, his indignation. This tender-hearted philanthropist is a\r\ndangerous, depraved egoist.\r\n\r\nThe irrational neighbourly love of the emotional mystic fails\r\nnecessarily in its ostensible aim, because it does not arise from a\r\nknowledge of the true needs of the neighbour. The mystic practises a\r\nsentimental anthropomorphism. He transfers his own feelings, without\r\nmore ado, to other beings, who feel quite differently from himself. He\r\nis in a condition bitterly to commiserate the moles because they are\r\ncondemned to brood in perpetual darkness in their underground passages,\r\nand dreams, perhaps with tears in his eyes, of introducing electric\r\nlight into their burrows. Because he, as seeing, would suffer severely\r\nunder the conditions of a mole’s life, therefore this animal is\r\nnaturally to be pitied also, although it is blind and so does not miss\r\nthe light. An anecdote relates that a child poured some hot water into\r\nthe drawing-room aquarium one winter’s day because it must have been\r\nso intolerably cold for the gold-fish; and in comic papers there is\r\nfrequently a hit at the benevolent societies which bestow warm winter\r\nclothing on the negroes at the equator. This is Tolstoi’s love of one’s\r\nneighbour put into practice.\r\n\r\nOne especial point of his moral doctrine is the mortification of the\r\nflesh. All sexual intercourse is for him unchaste; marriage is quite as\r\nimpure as the loosest tie. The _Kreutzer Sonata_ is the most complete,\r\nand at the same time most celebrated, embodiment of these propositions.\r\nPozdnyscheff, the murderer from motives of jealousy, says:[168] ‘There\r\nis nothing pleasant in the honeymoon; on the contrary, it is a period\r\nof continual embarrassment, a shame, a profound depression, and, above\r\nall, boredom--fearful boredom! I can only compare the situation to\r\nthat of a youth who is beginning to smoke: he feels sick, swallows his\r\nsaliva, and pretends to like it very much. If the cigar is to give him\r\nany pleasure, it can only be later on, as it is with marriage. In order\r\nto enjoy it, the married couple must first accustom themselves to the\r\nvice.’\r\n\r\n‘How do you mean--to the vice? You are speaking of one of the most\r\nnatural things--of an instinct.’\r\n\r\n‘Natural thing? An instinct? Not in the least. Allow me to tell you\r\nthat I have been brought to, and maintain, the opposite conviction. I,\r\nthe depraved and dissolute, assert that it is something unnatural....\r\nIt is an entirely unnatural treatment for any pure girl, just as it\r\nwould be for a child.’\r\n\r\nFurther on Pozdnyscheff develops the following crazy theory of the law\r\nof life: ‘The object of man, as of humanity in general, is happiness,\r\nand to attain it humanity has a law which must be carried out. This law\r\nconsists in the union of the individual beings which compose humanity.\r\nHuman passions only impede this union, particularly the strongest and\r\nworst of all, sensual love, sexual pleasures. When human passions,\r\nespecially the most violent, sensuality, shall have been suppressed,\r\nthe union will be accomplished, and humanity, having attained its end,\r\nwill have no further reason for existing.’ And his last words are:\r\n‘People should understand that the true meaning of the words of St.\r\nMatthew, “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed\r\nadultery with her already in his heart,” applies to one’s sister, and\r\nnot only to a strange woman, but also, and above all, to one’s own\r\nwife.’\r\n\r\nTolstoi, in whom, as in every ‘higher degenerate,’ two natures\r\nco-exist, of whom the one notices and judges the follies of the other,\r\nhas yet a distinct feeling of the senselessness of his _Kreutzer\r\nSonata_ theory, and he makes his mouthpiece, Pozdnyscheff, declare[169]\r\nthat he ‘was looked upon as cracked.’ But in the _Short Exposition_,\r\nwhere Tolstoi speaks in his own name, he develops, if with somewhat\r\nmore reserve, the same philosophy.[170] The temptation to break the\r\nseventh commandment is due to the fact that we believe woman to have\r\nbeen created for carnal pleasure, and that, if a man leave one wife\r\nand take another, he will have more pleasure. Not to fall into this\r\ntemptation, we must remember that it is not the will of the Father\r\nthat the man should have pleasure through feminine charms....’ In the\r\nstory _Family Happiness_[171] he likewise explains that a husband and\r\nwife, even if they have married from love, must become enemies in\r\ntheir wedded life, and it is quite purposeless to attempt a lasting\r\ncultivation of the original feelings.\r\n\r\nIt is not indeed necessary to refute a theory which pours contempt on\r\nall experience, all observations of nature, all institutions and laws\r\nthat have been historically developed, and the known aim of which is\r\nthe destruction of humanity. The thought of assailing it with zeal\r\ncould only occur to men who were themselves more or less deranged. It\r\nis sufficient for the healthy minded to state it in distinct language;\r\nit is at once recognisable, then, for what it is--insanity.\r\n\r\nFor Tolstoi the great enemy is science. In _My Confession_ he is never\r\ntired of accusing and abusing it. It is of no use to the people, but\r\nonly to governments and to capitalists. It occupies itself with idle\r\nand vain things, such as the inquiries into protoplasm and spectrum\r\nanalysis, but has never yet thought of anything useful, _e.g._, ‘how an\r\naxe and an axe-handle can best be manufactured; how a good saw ought to\r\nbe fashioned; how good bread can be baked, which species of flour is\r\nbest adapted for the purpose, how to manage the yeast, construct and\r\nheat the baking-oven; what foods and beverages are the most wholesome;\r\nwhat mushrooms are edible,’ etc.\r\n\r\nHe is, be it noted, particularly unfortunate in his examples, since,\r\nas a matter of fact, every beginner takes up all the subjects he\r\nenumerates in the scientific study of hygiene and mechanics. In\r\naccordance with his poetic nature, he has had a strong desire to embody\r\nhis views on science artistically. This he has done in the comedy\r\n_The Fruits of Enlightenment_. What does he scoff at in that? At the\r\npitiable blockheads who believe in spirits and, in dread of death, hunt\r\nafter bacteria. Spiritualism, and the opinions created in uneducated\r\nmen of the world by the imperfectly understood news of the day,\r\nconveyed in political papers, respecting infectious micro-organisms,\r\nare what he takes for science, and against them he directs the arrows\r\nof his satire.\r\n\r\nReal science does not need to be protected against attacks of this\r\nsort. I have already proved, in estimating the value of the reproaches\r\nwhich the neo-Catholic Symbolists and their critical patrons raised\r\nagainst natural science, that all those phrases were either childish\r\nor dishonest. The accusation of dishonesty cannot be brought against\r\nTolstoi. He believes what he says. But childish his complaints and\r\nhis mockery certainly are. He speaks of science as a blind man of\r\ncolour. He has evidently no suspicion of its essence, its mission, its\r\nmethods and the subjects with which it deals. He resembles Bouvard and\r\nPécuchet, Flaubert’s two idiots, who, completely ignorant, without\r\nteachers or guides, skim through a number of books indiscriminately,\r\nand fancy themselves in this sportive manner to have gained positive\r\nknowledge; this they seek to apply with the candour of a trained\r\nKrooboy, commit, self-evidently, one hair-raising stupidity after\r\nanother, and then believe themselves justified in sneering at science,\r\nand declaring it a vain folly and deception. Flaubert avenged himself\r\non the absurdity of his own efforts to conquer science as a lieutenant\r\nconquers a music-hall singer, by tarring and feathering Bouvard and\r\nPécuchet. Tolstoi exploded his little fuss and fume on Science, that\r\nproud, disdainful beauty, who is only to be won by long, earnest,\r\nunselfish service, by lampooning the blockheads of his _Fruits of\r\nEnlightenment_. The degenerate Flaubert and the degenerate Tolstoi meet\r\nhere in the same frenzy.\r\n\r\nThe way to happiness is, according to Tolstoi, the turning away from\r\nscience, the renunciation of reason, and the return to the life of\r\nNature; that is, to agriculture. ‘The town must be abandoned, the\r\npeople must be sent away from the factories and into the country to\r\nwork with their hands; the aim of every man should be to satisfy all\r\nhis wants himself’ (_What ought one to Do?_).\r\n\r\nHow oddly is reason mixed with nonsense even in these economic demands!\r\nTolstoi has rightly discerned the evils which follow the uprooting\r\nof the people from fostering Mother Earth, and the incubation of a\r\nday-wage-earning, urban industrial proletariate. It is true, also, that\r\nagriculture could employ very many more men healthily and profitably\r\nthan at present if the land were the property of the community,\r\nand each one received only such a share, and that only for his\r\nlifetime, as he could himself cultivate thoroughly. But must industry\r\non this account be destroyed? Would not that mean the destruction\r\nof civilization itself? Is it not rather the duty of intelligent\r\nphilanthropy and justice carefully to maintain the division of labour,\r\nthis necessary and profitable result of a long evolution, but at the\r\nsame time, through a better system of economy, to transform the artisan\r\nfrom a factory convict, condemned to misery and ill-health, into a free\r\nproducer of wealth, who enjoys the fruits of his labour himself, and\r\nworks no more than is compatible with his health and his claims on life?\r\n\r\nIt is vain to seek for even the slightest hint of such a solution in\r\nTolstoi. He contents himself with a barren enthusiasm for country life,\r\nwhich, if beautiful in Horace, has become annoying and ridiculous in\r\nRousseau; and he garrulously plagiarizes the hollow phrases about the\r\nworthlessness of civilization of the eloquent Genevese, who, smitten\r\nwith the mania of persecution, could only have led a sentimental\r\ncentury like his own by the nose. Return to nature! It is not possible\r\nto compress more absurdity into fewer words. On our earth Nature is\r\nour enemy, whom we must fight, before whom we dare not lay down our\r\nweapons. In order to maintain our span of life we must create endlessly\r\ncomplicated artificial conditions; we must clothe our bodies, build a\r\nroof over our heads, and store up provisions for many months, during\r\nwhich Nature denies us every nourishment. There is only one very\r\nnarrow strip of our planet where mankind can live without exertion,\r\nwithout inventions and arts, like the beast in the forest and the fish\r\nin the water, and that is on some of the South Sea islands. There,\r\nin perpetual spring, he certainly needs no clothes and no dwelling,\r\nor only some palm-leaves as a shelter from occasional rain. There,\r\nat all seasons of the year, he finds food constantly prepared for\r\nhim in the cocoanut palm, the bread-fruit tree, the banana, in some\r\ndomestic animals, in fish and mussels. No beast of prey threatens his\r\nsafety, and forces on him the development of strength and contempt of\r\ndeath. But how many men can this earthly paradise maintain? Perhaps\r\na hundredth part of present humanity. The remaining ninety-nine\r\nhundredths have only the alternative either of perishing, or of\r\nsettling in regions of our planet where the table is not spread, and\r\nthe pillow of delight is not prepared, but in which everything which\r\nlife demands for its sustenance must be procured artificially and\r\nlaboriously. The ‘return to Nature’ means, in our degrees of latitude,\r\nthe return to hunger, to freezing, to being devoured by wolves and\r\nbears. Not in the impossible ‘return to Nature’ lies healing for human\r\nmisery, but in the reasonable organization of our struggle with Nature,\r\nI might say, in universal and obligatory service against it, from which\r\nonly the crippled should be exempted.\r\n\r\nWe have now learnt to know the particular ideas which together\r\nconstitute Tolstoism. As a philosophy it gives explanations of the\r\nworld and of life, with unmeaning or contradictory paraphrases of some\r\nintentionally misunderstood Bible verses. As ethics, it prescribes the\r\nrenunciation of resistance against vice and crime, the distribution\r\nof property, and the annihilation of mankind by complete abstinence.\r\nAs sociological and economic doctrine it preaches the uselessness\r\nof science, the happiness of becoming stupid, the renunciation of\r\nmanufactured products, and the duty of agriculture, though without\r\nbetraying from whence the farmer is to get the necessary soil for\r\ncultivation. The remarkable thing in this system is, that it does not\r\nnotice its own superfluity. If it understood itself, it would restrict\r\nitself to one single point--abstinence--since it is evident that it is\r\nunnecessary to break one’s head over the aim and import of human life,\r\nover crime and love of your neighbour, and particularly over country\r\nor town life, if in any case through abstinence humanity is to die out\r\nwith the present generation.\r\n\r\nRod[172] denies that Tolstoi is a mystic. ‘Mysticism was always, as the\r\nword indicates, a transcendental doctrine. The mystics, especially the\r\nChristian mystics, have always sacrificed the present to the future\r\nlife.... What, on the contrary, astonishes an unprejudiced mind in\r\nTolstoi’s books is the almost complete absence of all metaphysics, his\r\nindifference to the so-called questions of the other world.’\r\n\r\nRod simply does not know what mysticism is. He unduly restricts the\r\nsense of the word, if he only uses it to mean the investigation of\r\n‘other-world questions.’ If he were less superficial he would know that\r\nreligious enthusiasm is only one special instance of a general mental\r\ncondition, and that mysticism is any morbid obscuration and incoherence\r\nof thought which is accompanied by emotionalism, and therefore includes\r\nthat thought, the fruit of which is the system at once Materialistic,\r\nPantheistic Christian, Ascetic, Rousseauistic and Communistic, of Leo\r\nTolstoi.\r\n\r\nRaphael Löwenfeld, whom we have to thank for the first complete German\r\nedition of Tolstoi’s works, has also written a very commendable\r\nbiography of the Russian novelist, yet in which he feels himself\r\nobliged, not only to take sides vehemently with his hero, but also to\r\nassure that hero’s possible critics beforehand of his deep contempt\r\nfor them. ‘Want of comprehension,’ he says,[173] ‘calls them (the\r\n“independent phenomena” of Tolstoi’s sort) eccentrics, unwilling\r\nto allow that anyone should be a head taller than the rest. The\r\nunprejudiced man, who is capable of admiring greatness, sees in their\r\nindependence the expression of an extraordinary power which has\r\noutgrown the possibilities of the time, and, leading on, points out\r\nthe paths to those coming after.’ It is indeed hazardous forthwith\r\nto accuse all who are not of his opinion of ‘want of comprehension.’\r\nOne who judges so autocratically will have to put up with the answer,\r\nthat he is guilty of ‘want of comprehension’ who, without the most\r\nelementary training, enters upon the criticism of a phenomenon, to the\r\nunderstanding of which some degree of æsthetical and literary so-called\r\n‘knowledge’ and personal feeling are very far from sufficient.\r\nLöwenfeld boasts of his capacity to admire greatness. He is possibly\r\nwrong not to presuppose this capacity in others also. What he precisely\r\nhas to prove is this, that what he admires deserves in truth the\r\ndesignation of greatness. His assertion, however, is the only proof he\r\nbrings on this most important point. He calls himself unprejudiced.\r\nIt may be admitted that he is free from prejudices, but then he is\r\nfree also from the preliminary knowledge that alone entitles anyone\r\nto form an opinion on psychological phenomena, which strike even the\r\nuninitiated as extraordinary, and to present them with self-assurance.\r\nDid he possess this preliminary knowledge he would know that Tolstoi,\r\nwho, ‘leading, is to point out the paths to those coming after,’ is a\r\nmere copy of a class of men who have had their representatives in every\r\nage. Lombroso[174] instances a certain Knudsen, a madman, who lived in\r\nSchleswig about 1680, and asserted that there was neither a God nor a\r\nhell; that priests and judges were useless and pernicious, and marriage\r\nan immorality; that men ceased to exist after death; that everyone must\r\nbe guided by his own inward insight,’ etc. Here we have the principal\r\nfeatures of Tolstoi’s cosmology and moral philosophy. Knudsen has,\r\nhowever, so little ‘pointed out, leading, the way to those coming\r\nafter,’ that he still only exists as an instructive case of mental\r\naberration in books on diseases of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that all Tolstoi’s idiosyncrasies could be traced to the\r\nbest-known and most often observed stigmata of higher degeneration. He\r\neven relates of himself:[175] ‘Scepticism brought me at one time to\r\na condition nearly bordering on frenzy. I had the idea that besides\r\nmyself nobody and nothing existed in the whole world; that things were\r\nnot things, but presentations, which only became phenomenal at what\r\ntime I directed my attention to them, and that these presentations\r\ndisappeared at once when I ceased to think of them.... There were hours\r\nwhen, under the influence of this fixed idea, I came to such a pitch\r\nof mental bewilderment that I at times looked quickly the other way,\r\nin the hope that in the place where I was not, I might be surprised\r\nby nothingness.’ And in his _Confession_ he says explicitly: ‘I felt\r\nthat I was not quite mentally sound.’[176] His feeling was correct. He\r\nwas suffering from a mania of brooding doubt, observable in many of\r\nthe ‘higher degenerates.’ Professor Kowalewski[177] explains the mania\r\nof doubt straight away as exclusively a psychosis of degeneration.\r\nGriesinger[178] relates the case of a patient who continually brooded\r\nover the notions of beauty, existence, etc., and put endless questions\r\nabout them. Griesinger, however, was less familiar with the phenomena\r\nof degeneration, and therefore held his case as ‘one little known.’\r\nLombroso[179] mentions in the enumeration of the symptoms of his\r\nmaniacs of genius: ‘Almost all are taken up, in the most painful\r\nmanner, with religious doubts, which disturb the mind and oppress the\r\ntimid conscience and sick heart, like a crime.’ It is not, then, the\r\nnoble desire for knowledge which forces Tolstoi to be ceaselessly\r\noccupied with questions concerning the aim and meaning of life, but\r\nthe degeneration-mania of doubt and brooding thought, which is barren,\r\nbecause no answer, no explanation can satisfy them. For it is obvious\r\nthat be the ‘therefore’ never so clear, never so exhaustive, it can\r\nnever silence the mechanically impulsive ‘wherefore’ proceeding from\r\nthe Unconscious.\r\n\r\nA special form of the phenomenon of scepticism and brooding thought is\r\na rage for contradiction, and the inclination to bizarre assertions, as\r\nis noted by many clinicists--_e.g._, Sollier[180]--as a special stigma\r\nof degeneration. It has appeared very strongly in Tolstoi at certain\r\ntimes. ‘In the struggles for independence,’ relates Löwenfeld,[181]\r\n‘Tolstoi frequently overstepped the limits of good taste, while he\r\ncombated tradition only because it was tradition. Thus he called ...\r\nShakespeare a scribbler by the dozen, and asserted that the admiration\r\n... for the great Englishman ...has properly no other origin than the\r\ncustom of echoing strange opinions with thoughtless obsequiousness.’\r\n\r\nWhat one finds most touching and most worthy of admiration in Tolstoi\r\nis his boundless spirit of fraternity. I have already shown above that\r\nit is foolish in its starting-points and manifestations. Here, however,\r\nI may have to point out that it is likewise a stigma of degeneration.\r\nThough he has not the experience of an alienist, the clear-minded,\r\nhealthy Tourgenieff has, by his own common-sense, ‘scoffingly’\r\ncalled Tolstoi’s fervent love for the oppressed people ‘hysterical,’\r\nas Löwenfeld[182] says. We shall find it again in many degenerate\r\nsubjects. ‘In contrast to the selfish imbecile,’ Legrain[183] teaches,\r\n‘we have the imbeciles who are good to excess, who are philanthropic,\r\nwho set up a thousand absurd systems in order to advance the happiness\r\nof humanity.’ And further on: ‘Full of his love for humanity, the\r\nimbecile patient, without reflection, takes up the social question\r\non its most difficult side, and settles it confidently in a series\r\nof grotesque inventions.’ This irrational philanthropy, untutored\r\nby judgment, which Tourgenieff, with just surmise if incorrect\r\ndesignation, called ‘hysterical,’ is nothing else than a manifestation\r\nof that emotionalism which constitutes for Morel the fundamental\r\ncharacter of degeneration. Nothing in this diagnosis is altered by\r\nthe fact that Tolstoi had the good fortune, during the recent famine,\r\nof being able to develop the most highly effective and most devoted\r\nhelpfulness for the alleviation of the misery of his countrymen. The\r\ncase happened to be very simple. The need of his fellow-creatures was\r\nof the most primitive form, want of bodily food. Fraternal love could\r\nlikewise set to work in its most primitive form, in the distribution of\r\nfood and clothing. A special power of judgment, a deep comprehension\r\nof the need of his fellow-creatures, was here unnecessary. And that\r\nTolstoi’s preparations for the relief of the sufferers were more\r\neffective than those of the proper authorities only proved the\r\nstupidity and incapacity of the latter.\r\n\r\nTolstoi’s attitude towards women also, which must remain\r\nincomprehensible to a healthy human understanding, will, in the light\r\nof clinical experience, forthwith be understood. It has been repeatedly\r\npointed out in these pages that the emotionalism of the degenerate\r\nhas, as a rule, an erotic colouring, because of the pathological\r\nalteration in their sexual centres. The abnormal excitability of\r\nthese parts of the nervous system can have as a consequence both an\r\nespecial attraction towards woman and an especial antipathy to her.\r\nThe common element connecting these opposing effects of one and the\r\nsame organic condition is the being constantly occupied with woman, the\r\nbeing constantly engrossed with presentations in consciousness from the\r\nregion of sexuality.[184]\r\n\r\nIn the mental life of a sane man, woman is far from filling the part\r\nshe plays in that of the degenerate. The physiological relation of\r\nman to woman is that of desire for the time being toward her, and\r\nof indifference when the state of desire is not present. Antipathy,\r\nlet alone violent enmity, to woman, the normal man never feels. If\r\nhe desires the woman, he loves her; if his erotic excitement is\r\nappeased, he becomes cool and more distant in his attitude, though\r\nwithout feeling aversion or fear. The man, from his purely subjective,\r\nphysiological necessities and inclinations, would certainly never have\r\ninvented marriage, the persistent alliance with woman. This is not\r\na sexual but a social arrangement. It does not rest on the organic\r\ninstincts of the individual man, but on the need of collectivity.\r\nIt depends on the existing economic order and the dominant opinions\r\nabout the State, its problems and its relations to the individual, and\r\nchanges its form with these. A man may--or at least should--choose a\r\ncertain woman for his consort out of love; but what holds him fast\r\nmarried, after a suitable choice and successful courtship, is no\r\nlonger physiological love, but a complex mixture of habit, gratitude,\r\nunsexual friendship, convenience, the wish to obtain for himself social\r\nadvantages (to which must naturally be added an ordered household,\r\nsocial representation, etc.), considerations of duty towards children\r\nand State; more or less, also, unthinking imitation of a universal\r\nobservance. But feelings such as are described in the _Kreutzer Sonata_\r\nand in _Family Happiness_ the normal man never experiences towards his\r\nwife, even if he has ceased to love her in the natural sense of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThese relations are quite otherwise in the degenerate. The morbid\r\nactivity of his sexual centres completely rules him. The thought of\r\nwoman has for him the power of an ‘obsession.’ He feels that he cannot\r\nresist the exciting influences proceeding from the woman, that he is\r\nher helpless slave, and would commit any folly, any madness, any crime,\r\nat her beck and call. He necessarily, therefore, sees in woman an\r\nuncanny, overpowering force of nature, bestowing supreme delights or\r\ndealing destruction, and he trembles before this power, to which he is\r\ndefencelessly exposed. If, then, besides this, the almost never-failing\r\naberrations set in, if he, in fact, commits things for woman for which\r\nhe must condemn and despise himself; or if woman, without its coming\r\nto actual deeds, awakens in him emotions and thoughts before whose\r\nbaseness and infamy he is horrified, then, in the moment of exhaustion,\r\nwhen judgment is stronger than impulse, the dread which woman inspires\r\nhim withal will be suddenly changed into aversion and savage hatred.\r\nThe erotomaniac ‘degenerate’ stands in the same position to the woman\r\nas a dipsomaniac to intoxicating drinks. Magnan[185] has given an\r\nappalling picture of the struggles waged in the mind of a dipsomaniac\r\nby the passionate eagerness for the bottle, and the loathing and\r\nhorror of it. The mind of an erotomaniac presents a similar spectacle,\r\nbut probably still stronger struggles. These frequently lead the\r\nunhappy creature, who sees no other means of escaping from his sexual\r\nobsession, to self-mutilation. There are in Russia, as is well\r\nknown, a whole sect of ‘degenerates,’ the Skoptzi, by whom this is\r\nsystematically exercised, as the only effective treatment to escape\r\nthe devil and be saved. Pozdnyscheff, in the _Kreutzer Sonata_, is\r\na Skopetz without knowing it, and the sexual morality which Tolstoi\r\nteaches in this narrative and in his theoretic writings is the\r\nexpression in literature of the sexual psychopathy of the Skoptzi.\r\n\r\nThe universal success of Tolstoi’s writings is undoubtedly due in\r\npart to his high literary gifts. But that part is not the greatest;\r\nfor, as we have seen in the beginning of this chapter, it was not his\r\nartistically most important creations, the works of his best years, but\r\nhis later mystical works, which have won for him his body of believers.\r\nThis effect is to be explained, not on æsthetical, but on pathological\r\ngrounds. Tolstoi would have remained unnoticed, like any Knudsen of\r\nthe seventeenth century, if his extravagances as a degenerate mystic\r\nhad not found his contemporaries prepared for their reception. The\r\nwidespread hysteria from exhaustion was the requisite soil in which\r\nalone Tolstoism could flourish.\r\n\r\nThat the rise and expansion of Tolstoism is to be traced, not to the\r\nintrinsic merit of Tolstoi’s writings, but to the mental condition\r\nof his readers, is made clear in the most significant manner by the\r\ndifference in those parts of his system which have made an impression\r\nin various countries. In every nation just such tones awakened an echo\r\nas were attuned with its own nervous system.\r\n\r\nIn England it was Tolstoi’s sexual morality that excited the greatest\r\ninterest, for in that country economic reasons condemn a formidable\r\nnumber of girls, particularly of the educated classes, to forego\r\nmarriage; and, from a theory which honoured chastity as the highest\r\ndignity and noblest human destiny, and branded marriage with gloomy\r\nwrath as abominable depravity, these poor creatures would naturally\r\nderive rich consolation for their lonely, empty lives, and their cruel\r\nexclusion from the possibility of fulfilling their natural calling. The\r\n_Kreutzer Sonata_ has, therefore, become the book of devotion of all\r\nthe spinsters of England.\r\n\r\nIn France Tolstoism is particularly valued for the way in which\r\nit casts out science, deposes the intellect from all offices and\r\ndignities, preaches the return to implicit faith, and praises the poor\r\nin spirit as alone happy. This is water to the mill of neo-Catholics,\r\nand those mystics, from political motives, or from degeneration, who\r\nerect a cathedral to pious symbolism, raise up also a high altar to\r\nTolstoi in their church.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, on the whole, but little enthusiasm is evinced for the\r\nabstinence-morality of the _Kreutzer Sonata_, and the intellectual\r\nreaction of _My Confession_, _My Religion_, and _Fruits of\r\nEnlightenment_. On the other hand, his followers in that country\r\nexalt Tolstoi’s vague socialism and his morbid fraternal love into\r\ntheir dogma. All the muddle-headed among our people who, not from\r\nsober scientific conviction, but from hysterical emotionalism,\r\nfeel a leaning towards a sickly, impotent socialism, which tends\r\nprincipally towards ministering cheap broth to proletarians, and\r\ntowards revelling in sentimental romances and melodramas from the\r\npretended life of the city worker, naturally discovered in Tolstoi’s\r\n‘give-me-something-communism,’ with its scorn for all economic and\r\nmoral laws, the expression of their--very platonic!--love for the\r\ndisinherited. And in the circles in which Herr von Egidy’s watery\r\nrationalism (at least a hundred years behind time) could rise into\r\nnotoriety, and in which his first writing could call forth nearly\r\na hundred replies, assents, and explanations, Tolstoi’s _Short\r\nExposition of the Gospel_, with its denial of the divine nature\r\nof Christ, and of existence after death, with its effusions of a\r\nsuperabundance of feelings of aimless love, its incomprehensible\r\npersonal sanctification and rhetoric morality, and especially with its\r\nastounding misinterpretation of the clearest passages from Scripture,\r\nmust indeed have been an event. All the adherents of Herr von Egidy are\r\npredestined followers of Tolstoi, and all Tolstoi’s admirers perpetrate\r\nan inconsistency if they do not enter into the new Salvation Army of\r\nHerr von Egidy.\r\n\r\nBy the special _timbre_ of the echo which Tolstoism calls forth in\r\ndifferent countries, he has become an instrument which is better fitted\r\nthan any other tendency of degeneration in contemporary literature for\r\nthe determination, measurement, and comparison, in kind and degree, of\r\ndegeneration and hysteria among those civilized nations in which the\r\nphenomenon of the Dusk of the Nations has been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE RICHARD WAGNER CULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen in a previous chapter that the whole mystic movement of\r\nthe period has its roots in romanticism, and hence originally emanates\r\nfrom Germany. In England German romanticism was metamorphosed into\r\npre-Raphaelitism, in France the latter engendered, with the last\r\nremains of its procreative strength, the abortions of symbolism and\r\nneo-Catholicism, and these Siamese twins contracted with Tolstoism a\r\nmountebank marriage such as might take place between the cripple of\r\na fair and the wonder of a show-booth. While the descendants of the\r\nemigrant (who on his departure from his German home already carried\r\nin him all the germs of subsequent tumefactions and disfigurements),\r\nso changed as to be almost unrecognisable, grew up in different\r\ncountries, and set about returning to their native land to attempt the\r\nrenewal of family ties with their home-staying connections, Germany\r\ngave birth to a new prodigy, who was in truth only reared with great\r\ntrouble to manhood, and for long years received but little notice\r\nor appreciation, but who finally obtained an incomparably mightier\r\nattractive force over the great fools’ fair of the present time than\r\nall his fellow-competitors. This prodigy is ‘Wagnerism.’ It is the\r\nGerman contribution to modern mysticism, and far outweighs all that\r\nthe other nations combined have supplied to that movement. For Germany\r\nis powerful in everything, in evil as in good, and the magnitude of\r\nits elementary force manifests itself in a crushing manner in its\r\ndegenerate, as well as in its ennobling, efforts.\r\n\r\nRichard Wagner is in himself alone charged with a greater abundance of\r\ndegeneration than all the degenerates put together with whom we have\r\nhitherto become acquainted. The stigmata of this morbid condition are\r\nunited in him in the most complete and most luxuriant development.\r\nHe displays in the general constitution of his mind the persecution\r\nmania, megalomania and mysticism; in his instincts vague philanthropy,\r\nanarchism, a craving for revolt and contradiction; in his writings all\r\nthe signs of graphomania, namely, incoherence, fugitive ideation, and a\r\ntendency to idiotic punning, and, as the groundwork of his being, the\r\ncharacteristic emotionalism of a colour at once erotic and religiously\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\nFor Wagner’s persecution mania, we have the testimony of his most\r\nrecent biographer and friend, Ferdinand Praeger, who relates that for\r\nyears Wagner was convinced that the Jews had conspired to prevent\r\nthe representation of his operas--a delirium inspired by his furious\r\nanti-Semitism. His megalomania is so well known through his writings,\r\nhis verbal utterances, and the whole course of his life, that a bare\r\nreference to it is sufficient. It is to be admitted that this mania was\r\nessentially increased by the crazy procedure of those who surrounded\r\nWagner. A much firmer equilibrium than that which obtained in Wagner’s\r\nmind would have been infallibly disturbed by the nauseous idolatry of\r\nwhich Bayreuth was the shrine. The _Bayreuther Blätter_ is a unique\r\nphenomenon. To me, at least, no other instance is known of a newspaper\r\nwhich was founded exclusively for the deification of a living man, and\r\nin every number of which, through long years, the appointed priests of\r\nthe temple have burned incense to their household god, with the savage\r\nfanaticism of howling and dancing dervishes, bent the knee, prostrated\r\nthemselves before him, and immolated all opponents as sacrificial\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nWe will take a closer view of the graphomaniac Wagner. His _Collected\r\nWritings and Poems_ form ten large thick volumes, and among the 4,500\r\npages which they approximately contain there is hardly a single\r\none which will not puzzle the unbiased reader, either through some\r\nnonsensical thought or some impossible mode of expression. Of his prose\r\nworks (his poems will be treated of further on), the most important\r\nis decidedly _The Art-work of the Future_.[186] The thoughts therein\r\nexpressed--so far as the wavering shadows of ideas in a mystically\r\nemotional degenerate subject may be so called--occupied Wagner during\r\nhis whole life, and were again and again propounded by him in ever new\r\nterms and phraseology. _The Opera and the Drama_, _Judaism in Music_,\r\n_On the State and Religion_, _The Vocation of the Opera_, _Religion\r\nand Art_, are nothing more than amplifications of single passages of\r\n_The Art-work of the Future_. This restless repetition of one and\r\nthe same strain of thought is itself characteristic in the highest\r\ndegree. The clear, mentally sane author, who feels himself impelled\r\nto say something, will once for all express himself as distinctly\r\nand impressively as it is possible for him to do, and have done with\r\nit. He may, perhaps, return to the subject, in order to clear up\r\nmisconceptions, repel attacks, and fill up lacunæ; but he will never\r\nwish to rewrite his book, wholly or in part, two or three times in\r\nslightly different words, not even if in later years he attains to\r\nthe insight that he has not succeeded in finding for it an adequate\r\nform. The crazed graphomaniac, on the contrary, cannot recognise in\r\nhis book, as it lies finished before him, the satisfying expression of\r\nhis thoughts, and he will always be tempted to begin his work afresh,\r\na task which is endless, because it must consist in giving a fixed\r\nlinguistic form to ideas which are formless.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental thought of the _Art-work of the Future_ is this: The\r\nfirst and most original of the arts was that of dancing; its peculiar\r\nessence is rhythm, and this has developed into music; music, consisting\r\nof rhythm and tone, has raised (Wagner says ‘condensed’) its phonetic\r\nelement to speech, and produced the art of poetry; the highest form of\r\npoetry is the drama, which for the purpose of stage-construction, and\r\nto imitate the natural scene of human action, has associated itself\r\nwith architecture and painting respectively; finally, sculpture is\r\nnothing but the giving permanence to the appearance of the actor in\r\na dead rigid form, while acting is real sculpture in living, flowing\r\nmovement. Thus all the arts group themselves around the drama, and the\r\nlatter should unite them naturally. Nevertheless they appear at present\r\nin isolation, to the great injury of each and of art in general.\r\nThis reciprocal estrangement and isolation of the different arts is\r\nan unnatural and decadent condition, and the effort of true artists\r\nmust be to win them back to their natural and necessary conjunction\r\nwith each other. The mutual penetration and fusion of all arts into\r\na single art will produce the genuine work of art. Hence the work\r\nof art of the future is a drama with music and dance, which unrolls\r\nitself in a landscape painting, has for a frame a masterly creation\r\nof architectural art designed for the poetico-musical end, and is\r\nrepresented by actors who are really sculptors, but who realize their\r\nplastic inspirations by means of their own bodily appearance.\r\n\r\nIn this way Wagner has set forth for himself the evolution of art. His\r\nsystem calls for criticism in every part. The historical filiation\r\nof the arts which he attempts to establish is false. If the original\r\nreciprocal connections of song, dance and poetry be granted, the\r\ndevelopment of architecture, painting and sculpture is certainly\r\nindependent of poetry in its dramatic form. That the theatre employs\r\nall the arts is true, but it is one of those truths which are so\r\nself-evident that it is generally unnecessary to mention them, and\r\nleast of all with profound prophetic mien and the grand priestly\r\ngestures of one proclaiming surprising revelations. Everyone knows from\r\nexperience that the stage is in a theatrical building, that it displays\r\npainted decorations which represent landscapes or buildings, and that\r\non it there is speaking, singing and acting. Wagner secretly feels that\r\nhe makes himself ridiculous when he strains himself to expound this\r\ntrite matter of first experience in the Pythian mode, with an enormous\r\noutlay of gush and exaltation ...; hence he exaggerates it to such a\r\ndegree as to turn it into an absurdity. He not only asseverates that in\r\nthe drama (more correctly speaking, the opera, or the musical drama, as\r\nWagner prefers to call it) different arts co-operate, but he asserts\r\nthat it is only through this co-operation that each individual art is\r\nadvanced to its highest capacity of expression, and that the individual\r\narts must and will surrender their independence as an unnatural error,\r\nin order to continue to exist only as collaborators of the musical\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nThe first asseveration is at least doubtful. In the cathedral of\r\nCologne architecture produces an impression without the representation\r\nof a drama; the accompaniment of music would add nothing whatever to\r\nthe beauty and depth of Faust and Hamlet; Goethe’s lyric poetry and the\r\n_Divina Commedia_ need no landscape-painting as a frame and background;\r\nMichael Angelo’s _Moses_ would hardly produce a deeper impression\r\nsurrounded by dancers and singers; and the _Pastoral Symphony_ does\r\nnot require the accompaniment of words in order to exercise its full\r\ncharm. Schopenhauer, although Wagner admired him as the greatest\r\nthinker of all time, expresses himself very decidedly on this point.\r\n‘The grand opera,’ he says,[187] ‘is, properly speaking, no product of\r\npure artistic sense, but rather of the somewhat barbaric conception\r\nof elevating æsthetic enjoyment through accumulation of means,\r\nsimultaneity of quite different impressions, and intensification of the\r\neffect through the multiplication of the operating masses and forces;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, music, as the mightiest of all arts, is able\r\nby itself alone completely to occupy the mind which is susceptible to\r\nit; indeed, its loftiest productions, to be appropriately grasped and\r\nenjoyed, demand a mind wholly undivided and undiverted, so that it may\r\nyield itself up to them, and lose itself in them, in order completely\r\nto understand their incredible inwardness of language. Instead of\r\nthis, in highly complicated operatic music the mind is besieged at\r\nthe same time by way of the eye, by means of the most variegated\r\npomp, the most fantastic pictures, and the liveliest impressions of\r\nlight and colour; while over and above this it is occupied with the\r\nstory of the piece.... Strictly speaking, then, one may call opera an\r\nunmusical invention for the benefit of unmusical minds, into which\r\nmusic must only be smuggled by means of a medium foreign to it, that\r\nis, as a sort of accompaniment to a long spun-out, insipid love-story,\r\nand its poetical thin broth; for the libretto of an opera does not\r\ntolerate concise poetry, full of genius and thought.’ This is an\r\nabsolute condemnation of the Wagnerian idea of the musical drama as\r\nthe collective art-work of the future. It might seem, it is true,\r\nthat certain recent experiments in psychophysics had come to the help\r\nof Wagner’s theory of the reciprocal enhancement of the simultaneous\r\neffects of different arts. Charles Féré[188] has, in fact, shown that\r\nthe ear hears more keenly when the eye is simultaneously stimulated\r\nby an agreeable (dynamogenous) colour; but, in the first place, this\r\nphenomenon may also be interpreted thus: that the keenness of hearing\r\nis enhanced not by the visual impression as such, not simply as\r\nsense excitation, but only through its dynamogenous quality, which\r\narouses the whole nervous system as well to a more lively activity.\r\nAnd then the question in Féré’s experiments is merely one of simple\r\nsense-perceptions, whereas the musical drama is supposed to awaken\r\na higher cerebral activity, to produce presentations and thoughts,\r\ntogether with direct emotions; in which case each of the arts acting\r\nin concert will produce, in consequence of the necessary dispersion of\r\nthe attention to it, a more feeble effect than if it appealed by itself\r\nalone to sense and intellect.\r\n\r\nWagner’s second assertion, that the natural evolution of each art\r\nnecessarily leads it to the surrender of its independence and to its\r\nfusion with the other arts,[189] contradicts so strongly all experience\r\nand all the laws of evolution, that it can at once be characterized\r\nas delirious. Natural development always proceeds from the simple to\r\nthe complex--not inversely; progress consists in differentiation,\r\n_i.e._, in the evolution of originally similar parts into special\r\norgans of different structure and independent functions, and not in\r\nthe retrogression of differentiated beings of rich specialization to a\r\nprotoplasm without physiognomy.\r\n\r\nThe arts have not arisen accidentally; their differentiation is the\r\nconsequence of organic necessity; once they have attained independence,\r\nthey will never surrender it. They can degenerate, they can even die\r\nout, but they can never again shrink back into the germ from which\r\nthey have sprung. The effort to return to beginnings is, however, a\r\npeculiarity of degeneration, and founded in its deepest essence. The\r\ndegenerate subject is himself on the downward road from the height\r\nof organic development which our species has reached; his imperfect\r\nbrain is incapable of the highest and most refined operations of\r\nthought; he has therefore a strong desire to lighten them, to simplify\r\nthe multifariousness of phenomena and make them easier to survey;\r\nto drag everything animate and inanimate down to lower and older\r\nstages of existence, in order to make them more easy of access to\r\nhis comprehension. We have seen that the French Symbolists, with\r\ntheir colour-hearing, wished to degrade man to the indifferentiated\r\nsense-perceptions of the pholas or oyster. Wagner’s fusion of the\r\narts is a pendant to this notion. His _Art-work of the Future_ is\r\nthe art-work of times long past. What he takes for evolution is\r\nretrogression, and a return to a primeval human, nay, to a pre-human\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nStill more extraordinary than the fundamental idea of the book is its\r\nlinguistic form. For example, let us estimate the following remarks\r\non musical art (p. 68): ‘The sea separates and unites countries; thus\r\nmusical art separates and unites the two extreme poles of human art,\r\ndancing and poetry. It is the heart of man; the blood which takes its\r\ncirculation from it gives to the outward flesh its warm living colour;\r\nbut it nourishes with an undulating, elastic force the nerves of the\r\nbrain which are directed inward’ [!!]. ‘Without the activity of the\r\nheart, the activity of the brain would become a piece of mechanical\r\nskill [!], the activity of the external limbs an equally mechanical,\r\nemotionless procedure.’ ‘By means of the heart the intellect feels\r\nitself related to the entire body [!]; the mere sensuous man rises\r\nto intellectual activity’ [!]. ‘Now, the organ of the heart [!] is\r\n_sound_, and its artistic language is music.’ What here floated before\r\nthe mind of Wagner was a comparison, in itself senseless, between the\r\nfunction of music as the medium of expression for the feelings, and\r\nthe function of the blood as the vehicle of nutritive materials for\r\nthe organism. But as his mystically-disposed brain was not capable\r\nof clearly grasping the various parts of this intricate idea, and of\r\narranging them in parallel lines, he entangled himself in the absurdity\r\nof an ‘activity of the brain without activity of the heart’; of a\r\n‘relation between the intellect and the whole body through the heart,’\r\netc., and finally attains to the pure twaddle of calling ‘sound’ the\r\n‘organ of the heart.’\r\n\r\nHe wishes to express the very simple thought that music cannot\r\ncommunicate definite images and judgments, but merely feelings of\r\na general character; and for this purpose devises the following\r\nrigmarole (p. 88): ‘It is never able ... of itself alone to bring\r\nthe human individual, determined as to sensation and morals, to an\r\nexactly perceptible, distinctive representation; it is in its infinite\r\ninvolution always and only feeling; it appears as an _accompaniment_\r\nof the moral deed, not as the _deed itself_; it can place feelings\r\nand dispositions side by side, not develop in necessary sequence one\r\ndisposition from another; it is lacking in _moral will_’ [!].\r\n\r\nLet the reader further bury himself in this passage (p. 159): ‘It\r\nis only and exactly in the degree to which the woman of perfected\r\nwomanliness, in her love for the man, and through her absorption into\r\nhis being, shall have developed the masculine element as well as this\r\nwomanliness, and brought it with the purely womanly element in herself\r\nto a complete consummation; in other words, in the degree in which she\r\nis not only the man’s mistress, but also his friend, is the man able to\r\nfind perfect satisfaction in a woman’s love.’\r\n\r\nWagner’s admirers asseverate that they understand this string of words\r\nthrown together at random. Indeed, they find them remarkably clear!\r\nThis, however, should not surprise us. Readers who through weakness\r\nof mind or flightiness of thought are incapable of attention always\r\nunderstand everything. For them there exists neither obscurity nor\r\nnonsense. They seek in the words over which their absent gaze flits\r\nsuperficially, not the author’s thoughts, but a reflection of their own\r\nrambling dreams. Those who have lived lovingly observant in children’s\r\nnurseries must have frequently seen the game in which a child takes\r\na book, or printed paper, and, holding it before his face, generally\r\nupside down, begins gravely to read aloud, often the story told him\r\nby his mamma yesterday before he dropped asleep, or, more frequently,\r\nthe fancies which at the moment are buzzing in his little head. This\r\nis somewhat the procedure of these blessed readers who understand\r\neverything. They do not read what is in the books, but what they put\r\ninto them; and as far as the process and result of this mental activity\r\nare concerned, it is certainly very much a matter of indifference what\r\nthe author has actually thought and said.\r\n\r\nThe incoherence of Wagner’s thought, determined as it is by the\r\nexcitations of the moment, manifests itself in his constant\r\ncontradictions. At one time (p. 187) he asserts, ‘The highest aim of\r\nmankind is the artistic; the most highly artistic is the drama;’ and in\r\na foot-note (p. 194) he exclaims, ‘These easy-going creatures are fain\r\nto see and hear everything, except _the real, undisfigured human being_\r\nwho stands exhorting at the exit of their dreams. _But it is exactly\r\nthis very human being whom we must now place in the foreground._’ It is\r\nevident that one of these affirmations is diametrically opposed to the\r\nother. The ‘artistic’ ‘dramatic’ man is not the ‘real’ man, and it will\r\nbe impossible for him, who looks upon it as his task to occupy himself\r\nwith the real man, to recognise art as ‘the highest aim of man,’ and to\r\nregard his ‘dreams’ as the most distinguished of his activities.\r\n\r\nIn one passage (p. 206) he says: ‘Who, therefore, will be _the artist\r\nof the future_? Unquestionably the poet. But _who_ will be the poet?\r\nIncontestably the _interpreter_. Again, however, _who_ will be the\r\ninterpreter? Necessarily the _association of all artists_.’ If this\r\nhas any sense at all, it can only be that in the future the people\r\nwill jointly write and act their dramas; and that Wagner really meant\r\nthis he proves in the passage (p. 225) where he meets the objection\r\nhe anticipated, that therefore the mob is to be the creator of the\r\nart-work of the future, with the words, ‘Bear in mind that this mob\r\nis in no way a normal product of real human nature, but rather the\r\nartificial result of your unnatural civilization; that all the devices\r\nand abominations which disgust you in this mob are only the desperate\r\nmovements of the fight which real human nature is carrying on against\r\nits cruel oppressor, modern civilization.’ Let us contrast with\r\nthese expressions the following passage from the treatise, _What is\r\nGerman?_[190]: ‘The fact that from the bosom of the German race there\r\nhave sprung Goethe and Schiller, Mozart and Beethoven, too easily\r\nseduces the greater number of persons of mediocre gifts into regarding\r\nthese great minds as belonging by right to them, and to attempt, with\r\nthe complacency of a demagogue, to persuade the masses that they\r\nthemselves are Goethe and Schiller, Mozart and Beethoven.’ But who, if\r\nnot Wagner himself, has thus persuaded the masses, proclaiming them to\r\nbe the ‘artists of the future’? And this very madness, which he himself\r\nrecognises as such in the remark quoted, has made a great impression\r\non the multitude. They have taken literally what Wagner, with the\r\n‘complacency of a demagogue,’ has persuasively said to them. They have\r\nreally imagined themselves to be the ‘artists of the future,’ and we\r\nhave lived to see societies formed in many places in Germany who wanted\r\nto build theatres of the future, and themselves to perform works of the\r\nfuture in them! And these societies were joined not only by students\r\nor young commercial employés in whom a certain propensity for acting\r\nplays comes as a malady of adolescence, and who persuade themselves\r\nthat they are serving the ‘ideal’ when with childish vanity and in\r\ngrotesque theatrical costume they gesticulate and declaim before their\r\ntouched and admiring relatives and acquaintances. Nay, old burgesses,\r\nbald and bulky, abandoned their sacred _skat_, and even the thrice-holy\r\nmorning tankard, and prepared themselves devoutly for noble dramatic\r\nachievements! Since the memorable occasion on which Quince, Snug,\r\nBottom, Flute, Snout, and Starveling rehearsed their admirable _Pyramus\r\nand Thisbe_, the world has seen no similar spectacle. Emotional\r\nshopkeepers and enthusiastic counter-jumpers got Wagner’s absurdities\r\non the brain, and the provincials and Philistines whom his joyful\r\nmessage had reached actually set about with their united strength to\r\ncarry on the work of Goethe and Schiller, Mozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\nIn the passages quoted, in which, in the most used-up style of\r\nRousseau, he glorifies the masses, speaks of ‘unnatural culture,’ and\r\ncalls ‘modern civilization’ ‘the cruel oppressor of human nature,’\r\nWagner betrays that mental condition which the degenerate share with\r\nenlightened reformers, born criminals with the martyrs of human\r\nprogress, namely, deep, devouring discontent with existing facts. This\r\ncertainly shows itself otherwise in the degenerate than in reformers.\r\nThe latter grow angry over real evils only, and make rational proposals\r\nfor their remedy which are in advance of the time: these remedies may\r\npresuppose a better and wiser humanity than actually exists, but, at\r\nleast, they are capable of being defended on reasonable grounds. The\r\ndegenerate subject, on the other hand, selects among the arrangements\r\nof civilization such as are either immaterial or distinctly suitable,\r\nin order to rebel against them. His fury has either ridiculously\r\ninsignificant aims or simply beats the air. He either gives no earnest\r\nthought to improvement, or hatches astoundingly mad projects for making\r\nthe world happy. His fundamental frame of mind is persistent rage\r\nagainst everything and everyone, which he displays in venomous phrases,\r\nsavage threats, and the destructive mania of wild beasts. Wagner is a\r\ngood specimen of this species. He would like to crush ‘political and\r\ncriminal civilization,’ as he expresses it. In what, however, does\r\nthe corruption of society and the untenableness of the condition of\r\neverything reveal themselves to him? In the fact that operas are played\r\nwith tripping airs, and ballets are performed! And how shall humanity\r\nattain its salvation! By performing the musical drama of the future! It\r\nis to be hoped that no criticism of this universal plan of salvation\r\nwill be demanded of me.\r\n\r\nWagner is a declared anarchist. He distinctly develops the teaching\r\nof this faction in the _Art-work of the Future_ (p. 217): ‘_All_ men\r\nhave but _one_ common _need_ ... the need of _living_ and _being\r\nhappy_. Herein lies the natural bond between all men.... It is only\r\nthe special needs which, according to time, place, and individuality,\r\nmake themselves known and increase, which in the rational condition\r\nof future humanity can serve as a basis for special associations....\r\nThese associations will change, will take another form, dissolve\r\nand reconstitute themselves according as those needs change and\r\nreappear.’[191] He does not conceal the fact that this ‘rational\r\ncondition of future humanity’ ‘can be brought about only by force’ (p.\r\n228). ‘Necessity must force us, too, through the Red Sea if we, purged\r\nof our shame, are to reach the Promised Land. We shall not be drowned\r\nin it; it is destructive only to the _Pharaohs_ of this world, who\r\nhave once already been swallowed up--man and horse ... the arrogant,\r\nproud Pharaohs who then forgot that once a poor shepherd’s son with his\r\nshrewd advice had saved their land from starvation.’\r\n\r\nTogether with this anarchistic acerbity, there is another feeling that\r\ncontrols the entire conscious and unconscious mental life of Wagner,\r\nviz., sexual emotion. He has been throughout his life an erotic (in a\r\npsychiatric sense), and all his ideas revolve about woman. The most\r\nordinary incitements, even those farthest removed from the province\r\nof the sexual instinct, never fail to awaken in his consciousness\r\nvoluptuous images of an erotic character, and the bent of the automatic\r\nassociation of ideas is in him always directed towards this pole of his\r\nthought. In this connection let this passage be read from the _Art-work\r\nof the Future_ (p. 44), where he seeks to demonstrate the relation\r\nbetween the art of dancing, music, and poetry: ‘In the contemplation\r\nof this ravishing dance of the most genuine and noblest muses, of the\r\nartistic man [?], we now see the three arm-in-arm lovingly entwined\r\nup to their necks; then this, then that one, detaching herself from\r\nthe entwinement, as if to display to the others her beautiful form\r\nin complete separation, touching the hands of the others only with\r\nthe extreme tips of her fingers; now the one, entranced by a backward\r\nglance at the twin forms of her closely entwined sisters, bending\r\ntowards them; then two, carried away by the allurements of the one\r\n[!] greeting her in homage; finally all, in close embrace, breast to\r\nbreast, limb to limb, in an ardent kiss of love, coalescing in one\r\nblissfully living shape. This is the love and life, the joy and wooing\r\nof art,’ etc. (Observe the word-play: _Lieben und Leben, Freuen und\r\nFreien_!) Wagner here visibly loses the thread of his argument; he\r\nneglects what he really wishes to say, and revels in the picture of\r\nthe three dancing maidens, who have arisen before his mind’s eye,\r\nfollowing with lascivious longing the outline of their forms and their\r\nseductive movements.\r\n\r\nThe shameless sensuality which prevails in his dramatic poems has\r\nimpressed all his critics. Hanslick[192] speaks of the ‘bestial\r\nsensuality’ in _Rheingold_, and says of _Siegfried_: ‘The feverish\r\naccents, so much beloved by Wagner, of an insatiable sensuality,\r\nblazing to the uttermost limits--this ardent moaning, sighing, crying,\r\nand sinking to the ground, move us with repugnance. The text of these\r\nlove-scenes becomes sometimes, in its exuberance, sheer nonsense.’\r\nCompare in the first act of the _Walküre_,[193] in the scene between\r\nSiegmund and Sieglinde, the following stage directions: ‘Hotly\r\ninterrupting’; ‘embraces her with fiery passion’; ‘in gentle ecstasy’;\r\n‘she hangs enraptured upon his neck’; ‘close to his eyes’; ‘beside\r\nhimself’; ‘in the highest intoxication,’ etc. At the conclusion, it\r\nis said, ‘The curtain falls quickly,’ and frivolous critics have not\r\nfailed to perpetrate the cheap witticism, ‘Very necessary, too.’ The\r\namorous whinings, whimperings and ravings of _Tristan und Isolde_,\r\nthe entire second act of _Parsifal_, in the scene between the hero\r\nand the flower-girls, and then between him and Kundry in Klingsor’s\r\nmagic garden, are worthy to rank with the above passages. It certainly\r\nredounds to the high honour of German public morality, that Wagner’s\r\noperas could have been publicly performed without arousing the greatest\r\nscandal. How unperverted must wives and maidens be when they are in a\r\nstate of mind to witness these pieces without blushing crimson, and\r\nsinking into the earth for shame! How innocent must even husbands and\r\nfathers be who allow their womankind to go to these representations\r\nof ‘lupanar’ incidents! Evidently the German audiences entertain\r\nno misgivings concerning the actions and attitudes of Wagnerian\r\npersonages; they seem to have no suspicion of the emotions by which\r\nthey are excited, and what intentions their words, gestures and acts\r\ndenote; and this explains the peaceful artlessness with which these\r\naudiences follow theatrical scenes during which, among a less childlike\r\npublic, no one would dare lift his eyes to his neighbour or endure his\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nWith Wagner amorous excitement assumes the form of mad delirium.\r\nThe lovers in his pieces behave like tom-cats gone mad, rolling in\r\ncontortions and convulsions over a root of valerian. They reflect a\r\nstate of mind in the poet which is well known to the professional\r\nexpert. It is a form of Sadism. It is the love of those degenerates\r\nwho, in sexual transport, become like wild beasts.[194] Wagner\r\nsuffered from ‘erotic madness,’ which leads coarse natures to murder\r\nfor lust, and inspires ‘higher degenerates’ with works like _Die\r\nWalküre_, _Siegfried_, and _Tristan und Isolde_.\r\n\r\nWagner’s graphomania is shown not only by the substance, but also by\r\nthe outward form of his writings. The reader will have been able to\r\nremark in the quotations given what a misuse Wagner makes of italics.\r\nHe often has whole half-pages printed in spaced letters. Lombroso\r\nexpressly establishes this phenomenon among graphomaniacs.[195] It\r\nis sufficiently explained by the peculiarity of mystical thought, so\r\noften set forth in this work. No linguistic form which the mystically\r\ndegenerate subject can give to his thought-phantoms satisfies him; he\r\nis always conscious that the phrases he is writing do not express the\r\nmazy processes of his brain; and as he is forced to abandon the attempt\r\nto embody these in words, he seeks, by means of notes of exclamation,\r\ndashes, dots, and blanks, to impart to his writings more of mystery\r\nthan the words themselves can express.\r\n\r\nThe irresistible propensity to play on words--another peculiarity\r\nof graphomaniacs and imbeciles--is developed to a high degree in\r\nWagner. I will here give only a few examples from the _Art-work of the\r\nFuture_--p. 56: ‘Thus it [the science of music] acquires through sound,\r\nwhich has become speech ... its most _exalted satisfaction_, and at\r\nthe same time its most _satisfying exaltation_,’ p. 91: ‘Like a second\r\nPrometheus, who from _Thon_ (clay) formed men, Beethoven had striven to\r\nform them from _Ton_ (music). Not from clay or music (_Thon_ or _Ton_),\r\nbut from both of these substances, should man, the image of Zeus, the\r\ndispenser of life, be created.’ Special attention may, however, be\r\ncalled to the following astounding passage (p. 103): ‘If fashion or\r\ncustom permitted us again to adopt, in speech and writing, the genuine\r\nand true use of _Tichten_ for _Dichten_ (to compose poetry), we should\r\nthus obtain, in the united names of the three primitive human arts,\r\n_Tanz_-, _Ton_-, and _Tichtkunst_ (dancing, music, and poetry), a\r\nbeautifully significant, sensuous image of the essence of this trinity\r\nof sisters, viz., a perfect alliteration.... This alliteration would,\r\nmoreover, be peculiarly characteristic, on account of the position\r\nheld in it by _Tichtkunst_ (poetry), for only as its last member would\r\n_Tichtkunst_ transform the alliteration into rhyme,’ etc.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the mysticism of Wagner, which permeates all his works,\r\nand has become one of the chief causes of his influence over his\r\ncontemporaries--at least, outside Germany. Although he is irreligious\r\nthrough and through, and frequently attacks positive religions, their\r\ndoctrines and their priests, there have, nevertheless, remained\r\nactive in him from childhood (passed in an atmosphere of Christian\r\nProtestant views and religious practices) ideas and sentiments which\r\nhe subsequently transformed so strangely in his degenerate mind. This\r\nphenomenon, viz., the persistence, in the midst of later doubts and\r\ndenials, of early-acquired Christian views, operating as an ever-active\r\nleaven, singularly altering the whole mind, and at the same time\r\nthemselves suffering manifold decomposition and deformation--may be\r\nfrequently observed in confused brains. We shall meet it, for example,\r\nin Ibsen. At the foundation of all Wagner’s poems and theoretical\r\nwritings there is to be found a more or less potent sediment of the\r\nCatechism, distorted as to its doctrines; and in his most luxuriant\r\npictures, between the thick, crude colours, we get glimpses of strange\r\nand hardly recognisable touches, betraying the fact that the scenes are\r\nbrutally daubed on the pale background of Gospel reminiscences.\r\n\r\nOne idea, or, more accurately, one word, has remained especially deeply\r\nfixed in his mind, and pursued him throughout his whole life as a real\r\nobsession, viz., the word ‘redemption.’ True, it has not with him the\r\nvalue it possesses in the language of theology. To the theologian\r\n‘redemption,’ this central idea of the whole Christian doctrine,\r\nsignifies the sublime act of superhuman love, which freely takes upon\r\nitself the greatest suffering, and gladly bears it, that it may free\r\nfrom the power of evil those whose strength is insufficient for such a\r\ntask. So understood, redemption presupposes three things. Firstly, we\r\nmust assume a dualism in nature, most distinctly developed in the Zend\r\nreligion; the existence of a first principle of good and one of evil,\r\nbetween which mankind is placed, and becomes the cause of their strife.\r\nSecondly, the one who is to be redeemed must be free from all conscious\r\nand wilful fault; he must be the victim of superior forces which he is\r\nhimself incapable of warding off. Thirdly in order that the redeemer’s\r\nact may be a true act of salvation and acquire power to deliver, he\r\nmust, in the fulfilment of a clearly recognised and purposed mission,\r\noffer himself in sacrifice. It is true that a tendency has often\r\nasserted itself to think of redemption as an act of grace, in which\r\nnot only the victims, but also sinners, may participate; but the\r\nChurch has always recognised the immorality of such a conception, and\r\nhas expressly taught that, in order to receive redemption, the guilty\r\nmust himself strive for it, through repentance and penance, and not\r\npassively await it as a completely unmerited gift.\r\n\r\nThis theological redemption is not redemption in Wagner’s sense. With\r\nhim it has never any clearly recognisable import, and serves only to\r\ndenote something beautiful and grand, which he does not more closely\r\nspecify. At the outset the word has evidently made a deep impression on\r\nhis imagination, and he subsequently uses it like a minor chord, let\r\nus say _a_, _c_, _e_, which is likewise without definite significance,\r\nbut, nevertheless, awakens emotion and peoples consciousness with\r\nfloating presentations. With Wagner someone is constantly being\r\n‘redeemed.’ If (in the _Art-work of the Future_) the art of painting\r\nceases to paint pictures, and produces thenceforth only decorations\r\nfor the theatre, this is its ‘redemption.’ In the same way the music\r\naccompanying a poem is a ‘redeemed’ music. Man is ‘redeemed’ when\r\nhe loves a woman, and the people is ‘redeemed’ when it plays at the\r\ndrama. His compositions also turn upon ‘redemption.’ Nietzsche[196] has\r\nalready remarked this, and makes merry over it, if with repulsively\r\nsuperficial witticisms. ‘Wagner,’ he says, ‘has meditated on nothing\r\nso much as on redemption’ (a wholly false assertion, since Wagner’s\r\nredemption-twaddle is certainly no result of meditation, but only\r\na mystical echo of childish emotions); ‘his opera is the opera of\r\nredemption. With him someone is always wanting to be redeemed--now a\r\nmale, now a female.... Who, if not Wagner, teaches us that innocence\r\nhas a predilection for redeeming interesting sinners (the case of\r\n_Tannhäuser_)? Or that even the Wandering Jew will be redeemed and\r\nbecome sedentary when he marries (the case of _The Flying Dutchman_)?\r\nOr that depraved old wantons prefer to be redeemed by chaste youths\r\n(the case of _Kundry_)? Or that beauteous maidens like best to be\r\nredeemed by a knight who is a Wagnerian (the case in _Meistersinger_)?\r\nOr that even married women like to be redeemed by a knight (the case of\r\n_Isolde_)? Or that the ancient god, after having morally compromised\r\nhimself in every respect, is redeemed by a free-thinker and an immoral\r\ncharacter (the case in the _Niebelungen_)? How particularly admirable\r\nis this last profundity! Do you understand it? As for me, defend me\r\nfrom understanding it.’\r\n\r\nThe work of Wagner which may be truly termed ‘the opera of redemption’\r\nis _Parsifal_. Here we may catch Wagner’s mind in its most nonsensical\r\nvagaries. In _Parsifal_ two persons are redeemed: King Amfortas and\r\nKundry. The King has allowed himself to become infatuated with the\r\ncharms of Kundry, and has sinned in her arms. As a punishment, the\r\nmagic spear which had been entrusted to him has been taken from him,\r\nand be wounded by this sacred weapon. The wound gapes and bleeds\r\nunceasingly, and causes him dreadful suffering. Nothing can heal it\r\nbut the spear itself which gave it. But ‘the pure fool who through\r\ncompassion knows’ can alone wrest the spear from the wicked magician,\r\nKlingsor. Kundry, when a young maiden, had seen the Saviour on the path\r\nof his Passion, and had laughed at him. As a penalty for her act she\r\nis doomed to live for ever, longing in vain for death, and seducing\r\nto sin all men who approach her. Only if a man is able to resist her\r\nallurements can she be redeemed from her curse. (One man has, in fact,\r\nresisted her, the magician Klingsor. Yet this victorious resistance\r\nhas not redeemed her as it ought. Why? Wagner does not reveal this by\r\na single syllable.) It is Parsifal who brings redemption to the two\r\naccursed ones. The ‘pure fool’ has no inkling that he is predestined\r\nto redeem Amfortas and Kundry, and he neither undergoes any suffering\r\nnor exposes himself to any serious danger in accomplishing the act\r\nof salvation. It is true that, in forcing his way into the enchanted\r\ngarden, he is obliged to have a small bout with its knights, but this\r\nskirmish is far more a pleasure than an effort for him, for he is far\r\nstronger than his adversaries, and, after some playful passes, puts\r\nthem to flight, bleeding and beaten. He certainly resists the beauty of\r\nKundry, and this is meritorious, yet it hardly constitutes an act of\r\ndeadly self-sacrifice. He obtains the magic spear without any effort.\r\nKlingsor hurls it at him to slay him, but the weapon ‘remains floating\r\nabove his head,’ and Parsifal has only to stretch out his hand to take\r\nit at his convenience, and then to fulfil his mission.\r\n\r\nEvery individual feature of this mystical piece is in direct contrast\r\nto the Christian idea of redemption, which has nevertheless inspired\r\nit. Amfortas is in need of redemption through his own weakness and\r\nguilt, not on account of an invincible fate, and he is redeemed without\r\nany assistance on his part beyond whining and moaning. The salvation he\r\nis awaiting and ultimately obtains has its source completely outside\r\nhis will and consciousness. He has no part in its attainment. Another\r\neffects it for him, and bestows it on him as a gift. The redemption\r\nis a purely external affair, a lucky windfall, and not the reward of\r\nan inward moral struggle. Still more monstrous are the conditions of\r\nKundry’s redemption. Not only is she not allowed to labour for her\r\nown salvation, but she is compelled to employ all her strength to\r\nprevent it; for her redemption depends on her being despised by a man,\r\nand the task to which she has been condemned is to turn to account\r\nall the seductive power of beauty and passionate solicitation to win\r\nover the man. She must by all possible means thwart the man by whom\r\nher redemption is to come, from becoming her redeemer. If the man\r\nyields to her charms, then the redemption is frustrated, not through\r\nher fault, though by her action; if the man resists the temptation,\r\nshe obtains redemption without deserving it, because in spite of her\r\nopposing effort. It is impossible to concoct a situation more absurd\r\nand at the same time more immoral. Parsifal the redeemer is, in fine,\r\nfrom beginning to end, a mystic re-incarnation of ‘Hans in Luck’ in\r\nthe German fairy-tale. He succeeds in everything without personal\r\neffort. He sets out to kill a swan, and finds the Grail and the royal\r\ncrown. His redeemership is no self-sacrifice, but a benefice. The\r\nfavour of Heaven has called him to an enviable, honourable office--on\r\nwhat powerful recommendation Wagner does not disclose. But a closer\r\nexamination reveals worse things. Parsifal, the ‘pure fool,’ is simply\r\na precipitate of confused reminiscences of Christology. Powerfully\r\nstruck by the poetical elements of the Saviour’s life and sufferings,\r\nWagner has been impelled to externalize his impressions and emotions,\r\nand has created Parsifal, whom he causes to experience some of the most\r\naffecting scenes of the Gospel, and who in his hands becomes (partly,\r\nperhaps, without his being aware of it) at once a foolish and frivolous\r\ncaricature of Jesus Christ. In the mystical work, the temptation of the\r\nSaviour in the desert is transformed into the temptation of Parsifal by\r\nKundry. The scene in the Pharisee’s house, where the Magdalene anoints\r\nthe Saviour’s feet, is reproduced exactly: Kundry bathes and anoints\r\nParsifal’s feet, and dries them with her unbound hair; and the ‘pure\r\nfool’ plagiarizes the words of Christ, ‘Thy sins be forgiven thee,’\r\nin this exclamation: ‘Thus I accomplish my first office; be baptized\r\nand believe on the Redeemer.’ That the ordinary theatre-goer is not\r\nshocked by this misused application of the Christ legend--nay, that in\r\nthe distorted fragments of the Gospel he is able to revive some of the\r\nemotions it perhaps at one time excited in him--is conceivable. But\r\nit is incomprehensible that earnest believers, and especially zealous\r\nfanatics, have never perceived what a profanation of their most sacred\r\nideas is perpetrated by Wagner, when he endows his Parsifal with traits\r\nof the Christ Himself.\r\n\r\nWe may mention only one of the other absurd details of the _Parsifal_.\r\nThe aged Titurel has succumbed to the earthly penalty of death, but\r\nthrough the Saviour’s mercy continues to live in the grave. The\r\nsight of the Grail continually renews for a time his waning vital\r\nstrength. Titurel seems to attach a great value to this comfortless\r\nlife-in-death existence. ‘By the mercy of the Saviour I live in the\r\ntomb,’ he joyously cries from his coffin, demanding with impetuous\r\nvehemence that the Grail be shown him, in order that his life may\r\nthereby be prolonged. ‘Am I to-day to see once more the Grail and\r\nlive?’ he asks in anguish, and because he receives no immediate answer\r\nthus laments, ‘Must I die unaccompanied by the Deliverer?’ His son,\r\nAmfortas, hesitates, whereupon the old man gives his orders: ‘Unveil\r\nthe Grail! The benediction!’ And when his wishes are complied with, he\r\nexults: ‘Oh, sacred bliss! How bright the Lord doth greet us to-day!’\r\nSubsequently Amfortas has for some time neglected the unveiling of the\r\nGrail, and hence Titurel has had to die. Amfortas is in despair. ‘My\r\nfather! highly blessed of heroes!... I, who alone was fain to die, to\r\nthee have I given death!’ From all this it undoubtedly results that all\r\nthe persons concerned see in life, even if it be the shadowy and empty\r\nlife of a being already laid in his coffin, an exceedingly precious\r\npossession, and in death a bitter misfortune. And this takes place in\r\nthe same piece in which Kundry endures eternal life as a frightful\r\ncurse, and passionately longs for death as a most delicious salvation!\r\nIs a more ridiculous contradiction conceivable? Moreover, the Titurel\r\nepisode is a denial of all the premises of _Parsifal_, constructed as\r\nit is on the foundation of the religious idea of personal persistence\r\nafter death. How can death frighten the man who is convinced that the\r\nbliss of paradise awaits him? We are here in the presence of the same\r\nnon-comprehension of his own assumptions which has already struck\r\nus in Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Tolstoi. But this is precisely the\r\npeculiarity of morbidly mystic thought. It unites mutually exclusive\r\nideas; it shuns the law of consistency, and imperturbably combines\r\ndetails which are dumbfounded at finding themselves in company. We do\r\nnot observe this phenomenon in one who is a mystic through ignorance,\r\nmental indolence, or imitation. He may take an absurd idea as a point\r\nof departure for a train of thought; but the latter unrolls itself\r\nrationally and consistently, and suffers no gross contradiction among\r\nits particular members.\r\n\r\nAs Christology inspired Wagner with the figures of _Parsifal_, so\r\ndid the Eucharist inspire him with the most effective scene of the\r\npiece--the love-feast of the Grail. It is the _mise-en-scène_ of\r\nthe Catholic Mass, with the heretical addition of one Protestant\r\nfeature--the partaking by the communicants of the elements in both\r\nkinds. The unveiling of the Grail corresponds to the elevation\r\nof the Host. The acolytes take the form of the choir of boys and\r\nyouths. In the antiphonal songs and the actions of Amfortas, we find\r\napproximations to all four parts of the Mass. The knights of the Grail\r\nintone a sort of stunted introit, the long plaint of Amfortas: ‘No!\r\nLet it not be unveiled! Oh, may no one, no one, fathom the depths of\r\nthis torment!’ etc., may be regarded as a _Confiteor_. The boys sing\r\nthe offertory (‘Take ye my blood for the sake of our love!’ etc.).\r\nAmfortas proceeds to the consecration; all partake in the Communion,\r\nand there is even a parodied reminiscence of the ‘Ite, missa est’ in\r\nGurnemanz’s exclamation, ‘Go out hence upon thy way!’ Since Constantine\r\nthe Great, since the elevation of Christianity to the rank of a State\r\nreligion, no poet has dared do what Wagner has done; he has drawn\r\ntheatrical effects from the incomparable rich emotional content of the\r\nfunction of the Mass. He felt profoundly the symbolism of the Lord’s\r\nSupper; it provoked in him a powerful mystical excitement, and the\r\nneed arose in him of endowing the symbolical event with a dramatic\r\nform, and of sensuously experiencing in all its details and in its\r\nentirety that which in the sacrifice of the Mass is only indicated,\r\ncondensed, and spiritualized. He wished to see and feel in his own\r\nperson how the elect enjoy, amid violent emotions, the body of Christ\r\nand His redeeming blood; and how super-terrestrial phenomena, the\r\npurple gleaming of the Grail and the downward hovering dove (in the\r\nfinal scene), etc., make palpable the real presence of Christ and the\r\ndivine nature of the Eucharist. Just as Wagner has borrowed from the\r\nChurch his inspiration for the scenes in the Grail, and then for his\r\nown purposes has popularized the liturgy in the style of the _Biblia\r\nPauperum_, so does the audience find again the cathedral and high mass\r\non his stage, and import into the piece all the emotions left in their\r\nsoul by Church ceremonies. The real priest in his sacerdotal robes,\r\nthe remembrance of his gestures, of the hand-bell and the genuflexions\r\nof the servers, the blue reek and perfume of the incense, the pealing\r\nof the organ and the play of chequered sunlight through the stained\r\nwindows of the church--these are, in the heart of the public, Wagner’s\r\ncollaborators; and it is not his art which lulls them into mystic\r\necstasy, but the fundamental mood inculcated in the vast majority of\r\nwhite races by two centuries of Christian sentiment.\r\n\r\nMysticism is, as we know, always accompanied by eroticism, especially\r\nin the degenerate, whose emotionalism has its chief source in\r\nmorbidly excited states of the sexual centres. Wagner’s imagination\r\nis perpetually occupied with woman. But he never sees her relation\r\nto man in the form of healthy and natural love, which is a benefit\r\nand satisfaction for both lovers. As with all morbid erotics (we have\r\nalready remarked this in Verlaine and Tolstoi), woman presents herself\r\nto him as a terrible force of nature, of which man is the trembling,\r\nhelpless victim. The woman that he knows is the gruesome Astarté of\r\nthe Semites, the frightful man-eating Kali Bhagawati of the Hindoos, an\r\napocalyptic vision of smiling bloodthirstiness, of eternal perdition\r\nand infernal torment, in demoniacally beautiful embodiment. No poetical\r\nproblem has so profoundly moved him as the relation between man and\r\nthis his ensnaring destroyer. He has approached this problem from\r\nall sides, and has given it different solutions corresponding to his\r\ninstincts and views of morality. The man frequently succumbs to the\r\ntemptress, but Wagner revolts against this weakness, of which he is\r\nhimself only too conscious, and in his chief works makes the man offer\r\na desperate, but finally victorious, resistance. Not, however, by his\r\nown strength does man tear himself from the paralyzing charm of woman.\r\nHe must receive supernatural aid. This proceeds most frequently from a\r\npure and unselfish virgin, who forms the antithesis to the sphinx with\r\nsoft woman’s body and lion’s paws. In conformity with the psychological\r\nlaw of contrast, Wagner invents as a counterpart to the terrible\r\nwoman of his inmost perception an angelic woman, who is all love, all\r\ndevotion, all celestial mildness; a woman who asks for nothing and\r\ngives all; a woman soothing, caressing and healing; in a word, a woman\r\nfor whom an unhappy creature pants as he writhes, consumed by flames,\r\nin the white-hot flames of Belit. Wagner’s Elizabeth, Elsa, Senta, and\r\nGertrude are extremely instructive manifestations of erotic mysticism,\r\nin which the half-unconscious idea is struggling for form, viz., that\r\nthe safety of the sexually crazy degenerate lies in purity, continence,\r\nor in the possession of a wife having no sort of individuality, no\r\ndesire and no rights, and hence incapable of ever proving dangerous to\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nIn one of his first compositions, as in his last, in _Tannhäuser_ as in\r\n_Parsifal_, he treats of the combat between man and his corruptress,\r\nthe fly versus the spider, and in this way testifies that for\r\nthirty-three years, from youth to old age, the subject has never been\r\nabsent from his mind. In _Tannhäuser_ it is the beautiful devil Venus\r\nherself who ensnares the hero, and with whom he has to wage a desperate\r\nconflict for the salvation of his soul. The pious and chaste Elizabeth,\r\nthis dream-being, woven of moonlight, prayer, and song, becomes his\r\n‘redeemer.’ In _Parsifal_ the beautiful devil is named Kundry, and the\r\nhero escapes the danger with which she threatens his soul only because\r\nhe is ‘the pure fool,’ and is in a state of grace.\r\n\r\nIn the _Walküre_ Wagner’s imagination surrenders itself to unbridled\r\npassion. He here represents the ardent man wildly and madly abandoning\r\nhimself to his appetite, without regard to the dictates of society, and\r\nwithout attempting to resist the furious impetuosity of his instinct.\r\nSiegmund sees Sieglinde, and thenceforth has but one idea--to possess\r\nher. That she is another’s wife--nay, that he recognises her as his\r\nown sister--does not check him for a moment. Those considerations are\r\nas feathers before the storm. He pays for his night of pleasure by his\r\ndeath the following morning. For with Wagner love is always a fatality,\r\nand ever round its pillow blaze the flames of hell. And as he has not\r\nmade manifest in Sieglinde the images of carnage and annihilation\r\nevoked in him by his idea of woman, he personifies these separately in\r\nthe _Walküre_. Their appearance in the drama is for him a psychological\r\nneed. The traits inseparable in his mind from his conception of woman,\r\nand ordinarily united by him in a single figure, are here separated and\r\nraised to the dignity of independent types. Venus, Kundry, are seducer\r\nand destroyer in one person. In the _Walküre_ Sieglinde is only the\r\nseducer, but the destroyer grows into a horde of gruesome Amazons, who\r\ndrink the blood of battling men, revel in the spectacle of murderous\r\nblows, and rush with wild, exulting cries across the corpse-strewn\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n_Siegfried_, _Götterdämmerung_, _Tristan und Isolde_ are exact\r\nrepetitions of the essential content of the _Walküre_. It is always\r\nthe dramatic embodiment of the same obsession of the terrors of love.\r\nSiegfried sees Brunhilde in the midst of her fire-circle, and both\r\ninstantly fall into each other’s arms in a rage of love; but Siegfried\r\nmust expiate his happiness with his life, and falls under the steel\r\nof Hagen. The mere death of Siegfried does not suffice for Wagner’s\r\nimagination as the inevitable consequence of love; destiny must show\r\nitself more terribly. The castle of Asgard itself breaks out in flames,\r\nand the slave of love in dying drags to his own perdition all the\r\ngods of heaven along with him. _Tristan und Isolde_ is the echo of\r\nthis tragedy of passion. Here also is the complete annihilation of\r\nthe sentiment of duty and self-conquest, by the springing up of love\r\nboth in Tristan and Isolde; and here also is death as the natural\r\nend towards which love is hurried. To express his fundamental mystic\r\nthought, that love is an awful fatality wherewith the unapproachable\r\npowers of destiny visit the poor mortal incapable of resistance, he\r\nhas resort to a childishly clumsy device; he introduces into his\r\ncompositions love-philtres of potent spell, now to explain the birth\r\nof the passion itself, and to indicate its superhuman nature, as\r\nin _Tristan und Isolde_; now to withdraw all the moral life of the\r\nhero from the control of his will, and show him as the plaything of\r\nsuper-terrestrial forces, as in the _Götterdämmerung_.\r\n\r\nThus Wagner’s poems give us a deep insight into the world of ideas of\r\nan erotically emotional degenerate nature. They reveal the alternating\r\nmental conditions of a most reckless sensuality, of a revolt of moral\r\nsentiment against the tyranny of appetite, of the ruin of the higher\r\nman and his despairing repentance. As has already been said, Wagner\r\nis an admirer of Schopenhauer and his philosophy. Like his master,\r\nhe persuaded himself that life is a misfortune, and non-existence\r\nsalvation and happiness. Love, as the constantly active incitement\r\nto the maintenance of the species and continuance of life, with all\r\nits accompanying sufferings, was bound to seem to him the source of\r\nall evil; and, on the other hand, the highest wisdom and morality, to\r\nconsist in the victorious resistance of this incitement, in chastity,\r\nsterility, the negation of the will to perpetuate the species. And\r\nwhile his judgment bound him to these views, his instincts attracted\r\nhim irresistibly to woman, and forced him during his whole life to\r\ndo all that flouted his convictions and condemned his doctrine. This\r\ndiscord between his philosophy and his organic inclinations is the\r\ninner tragedy of his mental life, and his poems form a unique whole,\r\nrecounting the process of the internal conflict. He sees a woman,\r\nat once loses himself, and is absorbed in her charms (Siegmund and\r\nSieglinde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, Tristan and Isolde). This is a\r\ngreat sin, demanding expiation; death alone is an adequate punishment\r\n(final scenes in the _Walküre_, _Götterdämmerung_, _Tristan und\r\nIsolde_). But the sinner has a timid and feeble excuse: ‘I could not\r\nresist. I was the victim of superhuman powers. My seducer was of the\r\nrace of the gods’ (Sieglinde, Brunhilde). ‘Magic philtres deprived\r\nme of my reason’ (Tristan, Siegfried in his relations with Gutrune).\r\nHow glorious to be strong enough to vanquish the devouring monster\r\nof appetite within! How radiant and exalted the figure of a man able\r\nto plant his foot on the neck of the demon woman! (Tannhäuser and\r\nParsifal). And, on the other hand, how beautiful and adorable the\r\nwoman who should not set ablaze the hell-fire of passion in man, but\r\naid him in quenching it; who should not exact of him a revolt against\r\nreason, duty, and honour, but be an example to him of renunciation and\r\nself-discipline; who, instead of enslaving him, should, as his loving\r\nhandmaid, divest herself of her own nature, to blend herself with his;\r\nin a word, a woman who would leave him safe in his defencelessness,\r\nbecause she herself would be unarmed! (Elizabeth, Elsa, Senta,\r\nGutrune). The creation of these forms of woman is a sort of _De\r\nProfundis_ of the timid voluptuary, who feels the sting of the flesh,\r\nand implores aid to protect him from himself.\r\n\r\nLike all the degenerates, Wagner is wholly sterile as a poet, although\r\nhe has written a long series of dramatic works. The creative force\r\ncapable of reproducing the spectacle of universal normal life is\r\ndenied him. He has recourse to his own mystico-erotic emotions for the\r\nemotional content of his pieces, and the external incidents forming\r\ntheir skeleton are purely the fruits of reading, the reminiscences\r\nof books which have made an impression on him. This is the great\r\ndifference between the healthy and the degenerate poet who receives\r\nhis sentiments at second-hand. The former is able to ‘plunge into\r\nfull human life,’ as Goethe says; to seize it, and either make it\r\nenter all breathing and palpitating into a poem which itself thus\r\nbecomes a part of natural life, or else remould it with idealizing\r\nart, suppressing its accidental, accessory features, so as to make\r\nprominent the essential; and in this way convincingly to reveal law\r\nbehind enigmatically bewildering phenomena. The degenerate subject,\r\non the contrary, can do nothing with life; he is blind and deaf to\r\nit. He is a stranger in the midst of healthy men. He lacks the organs\r\nnecessary for the comprehension of life--nay, even for its perception.\r\nTo work from a model does not lie within his powers. He can only copy\r\nexisting sketches, and then colour them subjectively with his own\r\nemotions. He can see life only when it lies before him on paper in\r\nblack and white. While the healthy poet resembles the chlorophyllic\r\nplant, which dives into the soil, and, by the honest labour of its own\r\nroots, procures for itself the nutritive materials out of which it\r\nconstructs its blossoms and fruit, the degenerate poet has the nature\r\nof a parasitic plant, which can only live on a host, and receives its\r\nnutriment exclusively from the juices already elaborated by the latter.\r\nThere are modest parasites and proud parasites. Their range extends\r\nfrom the insignificant lichen to the wondrous rafflesia, the flower\r\nof which, a yard in breadth, illumines the sombre forests of Sumatra\r\nwith the wild magnificence of its blood-red colour. Wagner’s poems\r\nhave in them something of the carrion stench and uncanny beauty of\r\nthis plant of rapine and corruption. With the single exception of the\r\n_Meistersinger_, they are grafted on the Icelandic sagas, the epics\r\nof Gottfried of Strassburg, Wolfram of Eschenbach, and the singer of\r\nthe Wartburg war in the Manessian manuscript, as on so many trunks of\r\nhalf-dead trees, and they draw their strength from these. _Tannhäuser_,\r\nthe _Niebelungen Tetralogy_, _Tristan und Isolde_, _Parsifal_, and\r\n_Lohengrin_, are constructed entirely from materials supplied him by\r\nancient literature. _Rienzi_ he derives from written history, and the\r\n_Fliegender Holländer_ from the tradition already utilized a hundred\r\ntimes. Among popular legends, that of the Wandering Jew has made\r\nthe deepest impression on his mind, on account of its mysticism. He\r\nhas elaborated it once in the _Fliegender Holländer_; a second time\r\ntransposed it feature for feature into a feminine form in the person of\r\nKundry, not without weaving into this inversion some reminiscences of\r\nthe legend of Herodias. All this is patchwork and dilettantism. Wagner\r\ndeceives himself (probably unconsciously) as to his incapacity for\r\ncreating human beings, representing, not men, but gods and demi-gods,\r\ndemons and spectres, whose deeds are not to be explained by human\r\nmotives, but by mysterious destinies, curses and prophecies, fatal and\r\nmagic forces. That which passes before our eyes in Wagner’s pieces is\r\nnot life, but spectres, witches’ sabbaths, or dreams. He is a dealer\r\nin old clothes, who has bought at second-hand the cast-off garments of\r\nfairy-tales, and makes of them (often not without clever tailoring) new\r\ncostumes, in which we may recognise, strangely jumbled and joined, rags\r\nof ancient gala stuffs and fragments of damascened suits of armour. But\r\nthese masquerading suits do not serve for clothes to a single being\r\nof flesh and blood. Their apparent movements are produced exclusively\r\nby the hand of Wagner, who has slipped into the empty doublets and\r\nsleeves, and behind the flowing trains and dangling robes, and kicks\r\nabout in them with epileptic convulsions, that he may awaken in the\r\nspectator the impression of a ghostly animation in this obsolete\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\r\nHealthy geniuses have also, no doubt, allied themselves with popular\r\ntradition or history, like Goethe in _Faust_ and _Tasso_. But what a\r\ndifference between the respective treatment by a healthy poet and a\r\ndegenerate one of that which they find, of that which is given! To\r\nthe former it is a vessel which he fills with genuine, fresh life, so\r\nthat the new contents become the essential part; to the latter, on\r\nthe contrary, the outside is and remains the chief thing, and his own\r\nactivity consists at best in choking the receptacle with the chaff of\r\nnonsensical phrases. The great poets, too, lay claim to the cuckoo’s\r\nprivilege of laying their egg in a strange nest. But the bird which\r\nissues from the egg is so much larger, handsomer and stronger than\r\nthe original denizens, that the latter are mercilessly driven from\r\ntheir home and the former remains the sole possessor. When the great\r\npoet puts his new wine into old bottles, he doubtless shows a little\r\nindolence, a little poverty of invention and a not very high-minded\r\nreckoning on the reader’s pre-existing emotions. But he cannot be\r\nheld too rigorously accountable for this small amount of stinginess,\r\nbecause, after all, he gives us so much that is his own. Imagine\r\n_Faust_ deprived of all the portions drawn from old popular books;\r\nthere would still remain nearly everything; there would remain all of\r\nthe man who thirsts for knowledge and seeks for it; all the struggle\r\nbetween his baser instincts craving for satisfaction, and the higher\r\nmorality rejoicing in renunciation; in brief, just that which makes\r\nthe work one of the loftiest poems of humanity. If, on the other hand,\r\nWagner’s old ancestral marionettes are stripped of their armour and\r\nbrocades, there remains nothing, or, at best, only air and a musty\r\nsmell. Assimilating minds have hundreds of times felt tempted to\r\nmodernize _Faust_. The undertaking is so sure of success that it is\r\nsuperfluous; Faust in dress-coat would be no other than the unaltered\r\nembodiment of Goethe’s own Faust. But imagine Lohengrin, Siegmund,\r\nTristan, Parsifal, as contemporaries! They would not even serve for\r\nburlesque, in spite of the Tannhäuser lampoon by the old Viennese poet\r\nNestroy.\r\n\r\nWagner swaggered about the art-work of the future, and his partisans\r\nhailed him as the artist of the future. He the artist of the future! He\r\nis a bleating echo of the far-away past. His path leads back to deserts\r\nlong since abandoned by all life. Wagner is the last mushroom on the\r\ndunghill of romanticism. This ‘modern’ is the degraded heir of a Tieck,\r\nof a La Motte-Fouqué--nay more, sad to say, of a Johann Friedrich Kind.\r\nThe home of his intellect is the Dresden evening paper. He derives his\r\nsubsistence from the legacy of mediæval poems, and dies of starvation\r\nwhen the remittance from the thirteenth century fails to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe subject alone of the Wagnerian poems can raise a claim to\r\nserious consideration. As for their form, it is beneath criticism.\r\nThe absurdity of his style, his shallowness, the awkwardness of his\r\nversification, his complete inability to clothe his feelings and\r\nthoughts in anything like adequate language--these have been so often\r\npointed out and exposed in detail that I may spare myself the trouble\r\nof dwelling on these points. But one faculty among the essential\r\nconstituents of dramatic endowment cannot be denied him--that of\r\npicturesque imagination. It is developed in him to the point of genius.\r\nWagner as a dramatist is really a historical painter of the highest\r\nrank. Nietzsche (in his skit, _Der Fall Wagner_[197]) perhaps means\r\nthe same when, without stopping at this important assertion, he calls\r\nWagner, not only ‘magnetizer’ and ‘collector of gew-gaws,’ but also\r\na ‘fresco-painter.’ This he is in a degree never yet attained by any\r\nother dramatic author in the whole world of literature. Every action\r\nembodies itself for him in a series of most imposing pictures, which,\r\nwhen they are composed as Wagner has seen them with his inner eye, must\r\noverwhelm and enrapture the beholder. The reception of the guests in\r\nthe hall of the Wartburg; the arrival and departure of Lohengrin in\r\nthe boat drawn by the swan; the gambols of the Rhine maidens in the\r\nriver; the defiling of the gods over the rainbow-bridge towards the\r\ncastle of Asgard; the bursting of the moonlight into Hunding’s hut;\r\nthe ride of the Walküre over the battlefield; Brunhilde in the circle\r\nof fire; the final scene in _Götterdämmerung_, where Brunhilde flings\r\nherself on to her horse and leaps into the midst of the funeral-pyre,\r\nwhile Hagen throws himself into the surging Rhine, and the heavens\r\nare aflame with the glow from the burning palace of the gods; the\r\nlove-feast of the knights in the castle of the Grail; the obsequies\r\nof Titurel and the healing of Amfortas--these are pictures to which\r\nnothing hitherto in art approaches. It is on account of this gift for\r\ninventing incomparably imposing spectacles that Nietzsche has termed\r\nWagner a ‘comedian.’ The word signifies nothing, and, in so far as it\r\nmay contain a tinge of contempt, is unjust. Wagner is no comedian,\r\nbut a born painter. If he had been a healthy genius, endowed with\r\nintellectual equilibrium, that is what he would undoubtedly have\r\nbecome. His inner vision would have forced the brush into his hand,\r\nand constrained him to realize it on canvas, by means of colour.\r\nLeonardo da Vinci had the same gift. It made him the greatest painter\r\nthe world had yet known, and at the same time the unsurpassed deviser\r\nand organizer of fêtes, pageants, triumphs, and allegorical plays,\r\nwhich, perhaps more than his genius as a painter, won for him the\r\nadmiration of his princely patrons Ludovico Moro, Isabella of Aragon,\r\nCæsar Borgia, Charles VIII., Louis XII., Francis I. But Wagner, as is\r\nthe case with all the degenerate, did not see clearly into his own\r\nnature. He did not understand his natural impulses. Perhaps also,\r\nwith the feeling of his own deep organic feebleness, he dreaded the\r\nheavy labour of drawing and painting, and, conformably with the law of\r\nleast effort, his instinct sought vent in the theatre, where his inner\r\nvisions were embodied by others--the decorative painters, machinists,\r\nand actors--without requiring him to exert himself. His pictures have\r\nunquestionably a large share in the effect produced by his pieces.\r\nThey are admired without an inquiry into how far their introduction\r\nis warranted by the rational course of the drama. However nonsensical\r\nas part of an action, they justify their appearance, from an artistic\r\nstandpoint, by their intrinsic beauty, which makes of them independent\r\næsthetical phenomena. Through their enormous aggrandizement by the\r\nmedia of the stage, their pictorial allurements are perceptible even to\r\nthe eye of the most crass Philistine, whose sense were otherwise dead\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nOf Wagner the musician, more important to all appearance than Wagner\r\nthe author, dramatic poet and fresco-painter, I treat lastly, because\r\nthis task will give us a clear proof of his degeneration, although\r\nthis is very much more evident in his writings than in his music,\r\nwhere certain stigmata of degeneration are not so prominent, and where\r\nothers appear as its unmistakable advantages. The incoherence in words,\r\nnoticeable at once to an attentive person, does not exhibit itself in\r\nmusic unless it is excessively strongly marked; the absurdity, the\r\ncontradictions, the twaddle, are hardly apparent in the language of\r\ntones, because it is not the function of music to express an exact\r\nmeaning, and emotionalism is not in it an indication of disease, since\r\nemotion is music’s proper essence.\r\n\r\nWe know, moreover, that high musical talent is compatible with a very\r\nadvanced state of degeneration--nay, even with pronounced delusion,\r\nillusion, and idiocy. Sollier[198] says: ‘We have to deal with certain\r\naptitudes very often manifested with great intensity by idiots and\r\nimbeciles.... That for music especially is often met with.... Although\r\nthis may seem disagreeable to musicians, it nevertheless proves that\r\nmusic is the least intellectual of all the arts.’ Lombroso[199]\r\nremarks: ‘It has been observed that the aptitude for music has been\r\ndisplayed almost involuntarily and unexpectedly among many sufferers\r\nfrom hypochondria and mania, and even among the really insane.’ He\r\ncites, with other cases, a mathematician attacked with melancholia, who\r\nimprovised on the piano; a woman seized with megalomania, who ‘sang\r\nvery beautiful airs, at the same time improvising two different themes\r\non the piano’; a patient ‘who composed very beautiful new and melodious\r\ntunes,’ etc.; and he adds in explanation that those who are afflicted\r\nwith megalomania and general paralysis surpass other mental invalids in\r\nmusical talent, ‘and from the very same cause as that of their unusual\r\naptitude for painting, viz., their violent mental excitation.’\r\n\r\nWagner the musician encounters his most powerful attacks from musicians\r\nthemselves. He himself bears witness to it:[200] ‘Both my friends\r\n(Ferd. Hiller and Schumann) believed that they very soon discovered\r\nme to be a musician of no remarkable endowment. My success also has\r\nseemed to them to be due to the libretti written by myself.’ In other\r\nlanguage, the same old story--musicians regarded him as a poet,\r\nand poets as a musician. It is of course convenient to explain _a\r\nposteriori_ the decisive judgments of men who were at once prominent\r\nprofessionals and sincere friends of Wagner by saying (after he had\r\nattained success) that his tendency was too novel to be immediately\r\nappreciated, or even understood, by them. This solution, however,\r\nhardly applies to Schumann, as he was a friend to all innovations, and\r\naudacities, even differing from his own, rather attracted than shocked\r\nhim. Rubinstein[201] still makes important reservations in regard to\r\nWagner’s music; and among serious contemporary musical critics who\r\nhave witnessed the birth, development and triumph of the Wagner cult,\r\nHanslick remained a long time recalcitrant, until at last, though not\r\nvery valiantly, he struck his colours in face of the overpowering\r\nfanaticism of hysterical Wagnerphiles. What Nietzsche (in his _Der Fall\r\nWagner_) says against Wagner as a musician is unimportant, since the\r\nbrochure of abjuration is quite as insanely delirious as the brochure\r\nof deification (_Wagner in Bayreuth_) written twelve years before.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unfavourable judgments of many of his professional\r\nbrethren, Wagner is incontestably an eminently gifted musician. This\r\ncoolly-expressed recognition will certainly seem grotesque to Wagnerian\r\nfanatics, who place him above Beethoven. But a serious inquirer into\r\ntruth need not trouble himself about the impressions provoked by Wagner\r\namong these persons. In the first period of his productivity Wagner\r\nmuch oftener achieved compositions of beauty than subsequently, and\r\namong these many may be termed pearls of musical literature, and will\r\nfor a long time enjoy even the esteem of serious and rational people.\r\nBut Wagner the musician had to confront a lifelong enemy, who forcibly\r\nprevented the full unfolding of his gifts, and this enemy was Wagner\r\nthe musical theorist.\r\n\r\nIn his graphomaniacal muddle he concocted certain theories, which\r\nrepresent so many fits of æsthetic delirium. The most important\r\nof these are the dogmas of the _leit-motif_ and of the unending\r\nmelody. Everyone now undoubtedly knows what Wagner understood by\r\nthe former. The expression has passed into all civilized languages.\r\nThe _leit-motif_, in which the threshed-out discarded ‘programme\r\nmusic’ was bound logically to culminate, is a sequence of tones\r\nsupposed to express a definite conception, and appears in the\r\norchestration whenever the composer intends to recall to the auditor\r\nthe corresponding conception. By the _leit-motif_ Wagner transforms\r\nmusic into dry speech. The orchestration, leaping from _leit-motif_\r\nto _leit-motif_, no longer embodies general emotions, but claims\r\nto appeal to memory and to reason, and communicate sharply defined\r\npresentations. Wagner combines a few notes into a musical figure, as\r\na rule not even distinct or original, and makes this arrangement with\r\nthe auditor:--‘This figure signifies a combat, that a dragon, a third\r\na sword,’ etc. If the auditor does not agree to the stipulation, the\r\n_leit-motifs_ lose all significance, for they possess in themselves\r\nnothing which compels us to grasp the meaning arbitrarily lent\r\nthem; and they cannot have anything of this kind in them, because\r\nthe imitative powers of music are by its nature limited to purely\r\nacoustical phenomena, or at most to those optical phenomena ordinarily\r\naccompanied by acoustical phenomena. By imitating thunder, music can\r\nexpress the notion of a thunderstorm; by the imitation of the tones of\r\na bugle, it can call up that of an army in such a way that the listener\r\ncan hardly have a doubt as to the significance of the corresponding\r\nsequences of tones. On the other hand, it is absolutely denied to\r\nmusic, with the means at its disposal, to produce an unequivocal\r\nembodiment of the visible and tangible world, let alone that of\r\nabstract thought. Hence the _leit-motifs_ are at best cold symbols,\r\nresembling written characters, which in themselves say nothing, and\r\nconvey to the initiated and the learned alone the given import of a\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nHere again is found the phenomenon already repeatedly indicated by us\r\nas a mark of the mode of thought among the degenerate--the unconscious\r\nmoon-struck somnambulous way in which they transgress the most\r\nfirmly-established limits of the particular artistic domain, annul the\r\ndifferentiation of the arts arrived at by long historical evolution,\r\nand lead them back to the period of the lacustrines, nay, of the most\r\nprimitive troglodytes. We have seen that the pre-Raphaelites reduce the\r\npicture to a writing which is no longer to produce its effect by its\r\npictorial qualities, but must express an abstract idea; and that the\r\nSymbolists make of the word, that conventional vehicle of a conception,\r\na musical harmony, by whose aid they endeavour to awaken not an idea,\r\nbut a phonetic effect. In precisely the same way Wagner wishes to\r\ndivest music of its proper essence, and to transform it from a vehicle\r\nof emotion into a vehicle of rational thought. The disguise produced by\r\nthis interchange of costumes is in this way complete. Painters proclaim\r\nthemselves writers; poets behave like the composers of symphonies; the\r\nmusician plays the poet. Pre-Raphaelites wishing to record a religious\r\napothegm do not make use of writing, which leaves nothing to be desired\r\nin the way of convenience, and by which they would be distinctly\r\nunderstood, but plunge into the labour of a highly-detailed painting,\r\ncosting them much time, and which, in spite of its wealth of figures,\r\nis far from speaking so clearly to the intelligence as a single line of\r\nrational writing. Symbolists desirous of awakening a musical emotion\r\ndo not compose a melody, but join meaningless, though ostensibly\r\nmusical words, capable, perhaps, of provoking amusement or vexation,\r\nbut not the intended emotion. When Wagner wishes to express the idea of\r\n‘giant,’ ‘dwarf,’ ‘tarn-cap which makes the wearer invisible,’ he does\r\nnot say in words universally understood ‘giant,’ ‘dwarf,’ ‘tarn-cap’\r\n(which makes the wearer invisible), but replaces these excellent words\r\nby a series of notes, the sense of which no one will divine without a\r\nkey. Is anything more needed to expose the complete insanity of this\r\nconfusion of all the means of expression, this ignorance of what is\r\npossible to each art?\r\n\r\nIt is Wagner’s ambition to imitate those facetious students who teach\r\ntheir dog to say ‘papa.’ He wants to perform the trick of making music\r\nsay the names ‘Schulze’ and ‘Müller’ (=Smith and Jones). The score\r\nshould, when necessary, supply the place of the directory. Language\r\ndoes not suffice him. He creates for himself a _volapük_, and demands\r\nthat his hearers should learn it. No admission without hard work! Those\r\nwho have not assimilated the vocabulary of the Wagnerian _volapük_\r\ncannot understand his operas. It is useless to go to the trouble of a\r\njourney to Bayreuth if one cannot talk fluently in _leit-motifs_. And\r\nhow pitiable after all is the result of this delirious effort! H. von\r\nWolzogen, the writer of the _Thematische Leitfaden_ (Thematic Guide)\r\nto the Niebelungen Tetralogy, finds in all these four prodigious works\r\nonly ninety _leit-motifs_. A language of ninety words, however inflated\r\nthey may be, such as ‘motif of the weary Siegmund,’ ‘motif of the mania\r\nfor vengeance,’ ‘motif of bondage,’ etc.! with such a vocabulary it\r\nwould be impossible even to exchange ideas about the weather with a\r\nnative of Tierra del Fuego. A page of Sanders’ lexicon contains more\r\nmeans of expression than Wolzogen’s entire dictionary of the Wagnerian\r\n_leit-motif_ language. The history of art knows no more astounding\r\naberration than this _leit-motif_ craze. To express ideas is not the\r\nfunction of music; language provides for that as completely as could\r\nbe desired. When the word is accompanied by song or orchestra it is\r\nnot to make it more definite, but to re-enforce it by the intervention\r\nof emotion. Music is a kind of sounding-board, in which the word has\r\nto awake something like an echo from the infinite. But such an echo of\r\npresentiment and mystery does not ring out from _leit-motifs_ coldly\r\npasted together, as if by the labour of a conscientious registrar.\r\n\r\nWith the ‘unending melody,’ the second of Wagner’s tenets, it is\r\nthe same as with the _leit-motif_. It is a product of degenerate\r\nthought; it is musical mysticism. It is the form in which incapacity\r\nfor attention shows itself in music. In painting, attention leads to\r\ncomposition; the absence of it to a uniformly photographic treatment\r\nof the whole field of vision as with the pre-Raphaelites. In poetry,\r\nattention results in clearness of ideas, consistency of statement,\r\nthe suppression of the unimportant, and the giving emphasis to the\r\nessential; its absence leads to twaddle as with the graphomaniacs,\r\nand to a painful prolixity in consequence of the indiscriminate\r\nrecording of all perceptions as with Tolstoi. Finally, in music\r\nattention expresses itself in completed forms, _i.e._, in well-defined\r\nmelodies; its absence, on the contrary, by the dissolution of form,\r\nthe obliteration of its boundary lines, and thus by unending melodies\r\nas with Wagner. This parallelism is not an arbitrary play of ideas,\r\nbut an exact picture of the corresponding mental processes among the\r\ndifferent groups of degenerate subjects, producing in the different\r\narts different manifestations according to their specific means and\r\naims.\r\n\r\nLet us grasp what melody is. It is the regular grouping of notes in a\r\nhighly expressive series of tones. Melody in music corresponds to what\r\nin language is a logically-constructed sentence, distinctly presenting\r\nan idea, and having a clearly-marked beginning and ending. The dreamy\r\nrambling of half-formed nebulous thoughts as little allows the mintage\r\nof sentences of this kind, as does the fleeting agitation of the vague\r\nbewildered emotion lead to the composition of a melody. The emotions,\r\ntoo, have their own grades of distinctness. They, too, can appear as\r\nchaotic, or as well-regulated states. In the one case they stand out in\r\nthe consciousness which grasps their composition and their purpose as\r\ndiscriminable modes strongly illuminated by the attention; in the other\r\ncase they are a disturbing enigma to consciousness, and perceived by\r\nit merely as a generic excitement, as a sort of subterranean trembling\r\nand rumbling of unknown origin and tendency. If the emotions are\r\nintelligible, they will be fain to manifest themselves in a form at\r\nonce the most expressive and most easily grasped. If, on the contrary,\r\nthey are a generic continuous state, without determined cause and\r\ndiscoverable aim, the music presenting them to the senses will be as\r\nblurred and as nebulously fluctuating in form as themselves. Melody\r\nmay be said to be an effort of music to say something definite. It\r\nis clear that an emotion unconscious of its cause and its aims, and\r\nunilluminated by attention, will not raise its musical expression to\r\nthe height of melody, precisely because it has nothing definite to say.\r\n\r\nA completed melody is a late acquisition of music, obtained by it\r\nonly after long evolution. In its historic, and still more in its\r\nprehistoric, beginnings, the art of music knew it not. Music springs\r\noriginally from song, and the rhythmic noise (_i.e._, noise repeated in\r\nequal or regular intervals of time) of accompanying stamping, knocking,\r\nor clapping of the hands; and song is nothing but speech grown louder\r\nand moving in wider intervals through emotional excitement. I should\r\nlike to cite only one passage from the almost unlimited literature on\r\nthis hackneyed subject. Herbert Spencer, in his well-known treatise on\r\n_The Origin and Function of Music_,[202] says: ‘All music is originally\r\nvocal.... The dance-chants of savage tribes are very monotonous, and\r\nin virtue of their monotony are much more nearly allied to ordinary\r\nspeech than are the songs of civilized races.... The early poems of the\r\nGreeks, which, be it remembered, were sacred legends embodied in that\r\nrhythmical, metaphorical language which strong feeling excites, were\r\nnot recited, but chanted; the tones and the cadences were made musical\r\nby the same influences which made the speech poetical.... This chanting\r\nis believed to have been not what we call singing, but nearly allied\r\nto our recitative; far simpler, indeed, if we may judge from the fact\r\nthat the early Greek lyre, which had but _four_ strings, was played in\r\n_unison_ with the voice, which was therefore confined to four notes....\r\nThat recitative--beyond which, by the way, the Chinese and Hindoos\r\nseem never to have advanced--grew naturally out of the modulations and\r\ncadences of strong feeling, we have, indeed, still current evidence.\r\nThere are even now to be met with occasions on which strong feeling\r\nvents itself in this form. Whoever has been present when a meeting of\r\nQuakers was addressed by one of their preachers (whose practice it is\r\nto speak only under the influence of religious emotion) must have been\r\nstruck by the quite unusual tones, like those of a subdued chant, in\r\nwhich the address was made.’\r\n\r\nRecitative, which is nothing but speech intensified, and allows no\r\nrecognition of completed forms of melody, is therefore the most ancient\r\nform of music; it is the degree of development reached by the art of\r\nmusic among savages, the ancient Greeks, and contemporary races in\r\nEastern Asia. Wagner’s ‘unending melody’ is nothing but recitative,\r\nrichly harmonized and animated, but, nevertheless, recitative. The name\r\nbestowed by him on his pretended invention must not mislead us. In the\r\nmouth of the degenerate a word has never the meaning ascribed to it\r\nby universal language. Wagner calmly applies the term ‘melody’--with\r\na distinguishing adjective--to a form which is actually the negation\r\nand suppression of melody. He designates unending melody as an advance\r\nin music, while it is really a return to its primeval starting-point.\r\nHere there recurs in Wagner what we have so often laid stress upon in\r\nthe preceding chapters, viz., that by a strange optical illusion the\r\ndegenerate regard their atavism, their morbid reversion to the most\r\nremote and lowest grades of evolution, as an ascent into the future.\r\n\r\nWagner was led to his theory of unending melody by his limited capacity\r\nfor the invention of finite, that is of real, melodies. His weakness in\r\nmelodic creation has struck all impartial musicians. In youth his power\r\nin this direction was more abundant, and he succeeded in creating some\r\nsuperb melodies (in _Tannhäuser_, _Lohengrin_, _Fliegende Höllander_).\r\nWith increasing age this power became more and more impoverished, and\r\nin proportion as the torrent of melodic invention dried up in him, he\r\naccentuated his theory of unending melody with ever more obstinacy and\r\nasperity. Always there reappears the well-known device of concocting\r\na theory _a posteriori_ as a plausible ground for, and palliation\r\nof, what is done through unconscious organic necessity. Wagner was\r\nincapable of distinguishing the individual personages of his operas\r\nby a purely musical characterization, and therefore he invented the\r\n_leit-motif_.[203] Experiencing a great difficulty, especially with\r\nadvancing age, in creating true melodies, he set up the postulate of\r\nthe unending melody.\r\n\r\nAll the other crotchets of his musical theory also find their\r\nexplanation in this clear consciousness of definite incompetency. In\r\nthe _Art-work of the Future_ he overwhelms the theory of counterpoint\r\nand the contrapuntists--those dull pedants who abase the most vital\r\nof all arts to a desiccated, dead mathematics--with a scorn intended\r\nto be biting, but producing the effect of an echo of Schopenhauer’s\r\ninvectives against the German philosophers. Why? Because, as an\r\ninattentive mystic, abandoned to amorphous dreams, he must feel\r\nintolerably oppressed by the severe discipline and fixed rules of the\r\ntheory of composition, which gave a grammar to the musical babbling\r\nof primeval times, and made of it a worthy medium for the expression\r\nof the emotions of civilized men. He asserts that pure instrumental\r\nmusic ended with Beethoven; that progress after him is impossible; that\r\n‘musical declamation’ is the only path along which the art of music can\r\nfurther develop itself. It may be that, after Beethoven, instrumental\r\nmusic will make no progress for decades, or for centuries. He was such\r\na stupendous genius that it is, in fact, difficult to imagine how he\r\ncan be surpassed, or even equalled. Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare,\r\nCervantes, Goethe, produce a similar impression; and, in truth, these\r\ngeniuses have not yet been surpassed. It is also conceivable that\r\nthere are limits which it is impossible for any given art to pass at\r\nall, so that a very great genius says the last word for it, and after\r\nthat no progress can be made in it. In such a case, however, the\r\naspirant should humbly say: ‘I know that I cannot do better than the\r\nsupreme master of my art; I am therefore contented to labour as one\r\nof the _epigoni_ in the shadow of his greatness, content if my work\r\nexpresses some peculiarities of my individuality.’ He ought not in\r\npresumptuous self-conceit to affirm: ‘There is no sense in emulating\r\nthe eagle-flight of the mighty one; progress now lies alone in the\r\nflapping of my bats’-wings.’ But this is exactly what Wagner does. Not\r\nbeing himself endowed with any great gift for pure instrumental music,\r\nas his few symphonic works suffice to prove, he decrees in the tone of\r\ninfallibility: ‘Instrumental music ended with Beethoven. It is an error\r\nto seek for anything on this well-browsed field. The future of music\r\nlies in the accompaniment of the word, and I am he who is to show you\r\nthe way into that future.’\r\n\r\nHere Wagner simply makes a virtue of his necessity, and of his\r\nweakness a title of glory. The symphony is the highest differentiation\r\nof musical art. In it music has wholly discarded its relationship with\r\nwords, and attained its highest independence. Hence the symphony is\r\nthe most musical of all that music can produce. To disown it is to\r\ndisown that music is a special, differentiated art. To place above the\r\nsymphony music as an accompaniment of words is to raise the handmaiden\r\nto a higher rank than her free-born mistress. It will never occur to\r\na composer, whose inmost being is charged with musical feeling and\r\nthought, to seek words instead of musical themes for the expression of\r\nthat in him which is yearning for embodiment. For if it does occur to\r\nhim, it is a proof that in his inmost being he is a poet or an author,\r\nand not a musician. The choruses in the Ninth Symphony are not to\r\nbe cited as proof of the inaccuracy of this assertion. In that case\r\nBeethoven was overmastered by an emotion so powerful and univocal,\r\nthat the more general and equivocal character of purely musical\r\nexpression could no longer suffice for him, and he was unconditionally\r\ncompelled to call in the aid of words. In the deeply significant\r\nBiblical legend, even Balaam’s ass acquired the power of speech when\r\nhe had something definite to say. The emotion which becomes clearly\r\nconscious of its content and aim ceases to be a mere emotion, and\r\ntransforms itself into presentation, notion and judgment, but these\r\nexpress themselves, not in music, but in articulate language. When\r\nWagner, as a fundamental principle, placed music as an accompaniment\r\nto words above that which is purely instrumental, and not as a medium\r\nfor the expression of thought--for in regard to that there can be no\r\ndifference of opinion--but as a musical form properly so called, he\r\nonly proved that, in the inmost depths of his nature, and by virtue of\r\nhis organic disposition, he was not a musician, but a confused mixture\r\nof a poet feeble in style, and a painter lazy of brush, with a Javanese\r\n‘gamelang’ accompaniment buzzing in between. This is the case with\r\nmost ‘higher degenerates,’ except that the separate fragments of their\r\nstrangely intermingled hybrid talent are not so strong and great as\r\nWagner’s.\r\n\r\nThe musical productions in which Wagner has been most successful--the\r\nVenusberg music; the E flat, G, B flat, ‘Wigala-Weia’ of the\r\nRhinemaidens, repeated one hundred and thirty-six times; the Walküre\r\nride; the fire incantation; the murmur of the forest; the Siegfried\r\nidyl; the Good-Friday spell; magnificent compositions, and highly\r\npraised with justice--show precisely the peculiarly unmusical character\r\nof his genius. All these pieces have one thing in common that they\r\ndepict. They are not an inner emotion crying out from the soul in\r\nmusic, but the mental vision of the gifted eye of a painter, which\r\nWagner, with gigantic power, but also with gigantic aberration,\r\nstrives to fix in tones instead of lines and colours. He avails himself\r\nof natural sounds or noises, either imitating them directly, or\r\nawakening ideas of them through association, reproducing the ripple and\r\nroar of waves, the sough of the tree-top and the song of wild birds,\r\nwhich are in themselves acoustic; or, by an acoustic parallelism,\r\nthe optical phenomena of the movements in the dance of voluptuous\r\nfemale forms, the tearing along of fiercely snorting steeds, the\r\nblazing and flickering of flames, etc. These creations are not the\r\noutgrowth of emotional excitement, but have been produced by external\r\nimpressions conveyed through the senses; they are not the utterance\r\nof a feeling but a reflection--_i.e._, something essentially optical.\r\nI might compare Wagner’s music, at its very best, to the flight of\r\nflying-fishes. It is an astonishing and dazzling spectacle, and yet\r\nunnatural. It is a straying from a native to an alien element. Above\r\nall, it is something absolutely barren and incapable of profiting\r\neither normal fishes or normal birds.\r\n\r\nWagner has felt this himself very forcibly; he was quite clear on\r\nthe point that no one could build further on the foundation of his\r\ntone-paintings; for with reference to the efforts of musicians eagerly\r\ndesirous of founding a Wagner school, he complains[204] that ‘younger\r\ncomposers were most irrationally putting themselves to trouble in\r\nimitating him.’\r\n\r\nA searching examination has thus shown us that this pretended musician\r\nof the future is an out-and-out musician of long-ago. All the\r\ncharacteristics of his talent point not forward, but far behind us.\r\nHis _leit-motif_, abasing music to a conventional phonetic symbol, is\r\natavism; his unending melody is atavism, leading back the fixed form\r\nto the vague recitative of savages; atavism, his subordination of\r\nhighly differentiated instrumental music to music-drama, which mixes\r\nmusic and poetry, and allows neither of the two art-forms to attain\r\nto independence; even his peculiarity of almost never permitting more\r\nthan one person on the stage to sing and of avoiding vocal polyphony is\r\natavism. As a personality he will occupy an important place in music;\r\nas an initiator, or developer of his art, hardly any, or a very narrow\r\none. For the only thing that musicians of healthy capacity can learn\r\nfrom him is to keep song and accompaniment in opera closely connected\r\nwith the words, to declaim with sincerity and propriety, and to suggest\r\npictorial ideas to the imagination by means of orchestral effects. But\r\nI dare not decide whether the latter is an enlargement or an upheaval\r\nof the natural boundaries of musical art, and in any event disciples\r\nof Wagner must use his rich musical palette with caution if they are\r\nnot to be led astray.\r\n\r\nWagner’s mighty influence on his contemporaries is to be explained,\r\nneither by his capacities as author and musician, nor by any of his\r\npersonal qualities, with the exception, perhaps, of that ‘stubborn\r\nperseverance in one and the same fundamental idea’ which Lombroso[205]\r\ncites as a characteristic of graphomaniacs, but by the peculiarities\r\nin the life of the present nervous temperament. His earthly destiny\r\nresembles that of those strange Oriental plants known as ‘Jericho\r\nroses’ (_Anastatica asteriscus_), which, dingy-brown in colour,\r\nleathery and dry, roll about, driven by every wind, until they reach\r\na congenial soil, when they take root and blossom into full-blown\r\nflowers. To the end of his life Wagner’s existence was conflict and\r\nbitterness, and his boastings had no other echo than the laughter\r\nnot only of rational beings, but, alas! of fools also. It was not\r\nuntil he had long passed his fiftieth year that he began to know the\r\nintoxication of universal fame; and in the last decade of his life he\r\nwas installed among the demi-gods. It had come to this, that the world\r\nhad, in the interval, become ripe for him--and for the madhouse. He had\r\nthe good fortune to endure until the general degeneration and hysteria\r\nwere sufficiently advanced to supply a rich and nutritious soil for his\r\ntheories and his art.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon repeatedly established and verified in these pages, that\r\nlunatics fly to each other as iron filings to the magnet, is quite\r\nstrikingly observable in Wagner’s life. His first great patroness\r\nwas the Princess Metternich, daughter of the well-known eccentric\r\nCount Sandor, and whose own eccentricities formed material for the\r\nchronicle of the Napoleonic Court. His most enthusiastic disciple and\r\ndefender was Franz Liszt, whom I have elsewhere characterized (see\r\nmy _Ausgewählte Pariser Briefe_; 2^{te} Auflage; Leipzig, 1887, p.\r\n172), and of whom I will therefore only briefly remark that he bore\r\nin his nature the greatest resemblance to Wagner. He was an author\r\n(his works, filling six thick volumes, have an honourable place in the\r\nliterature of graphomaniacs), composer, erotomaniac and mystic, all in\r\nan incomparably lower degree than Wagner, whom he surpassed only in a\r\nprodigiously developed talent for pianoforte-playing. Wagner was an\r\nenthusiastic admirer of all graphomaniacs who came in his way--_e.g._,\r\nof that A. Gleizès expressly cited by Lombroso[206] as a lunatic, but\r\nwhom Wagner praises in most exuberant terms;[207] and he even gathered\r\nround him a court of select graphomaniacs, among whom may be mentioned\r\nNietzsche, whose insanity compelled his confinement in a madhouse; H.\r\nvon Wolzogen, whose _Poetische Laut-Symbolik_ might have been written\r\nby the most exquisite of French ‘Symbolists’ or ‘Instrumentists’;[208]\r\nHenri Porges, E. von Hagen, etc. But the most important relations of\r\nthis kind were with the unhappy King Louis II. In him Wagner found\r\nthe soul he needed. In him he met with a full comprehension of all\r\nhis theories and his creations. It may be safely asserted that Louis\r\nof Bavaria created the Wagner Cult. Only when the King became his\r\nprotector did Wagner and his efforts become of importance for the\r\nhistory of civilization; not, perhaps, because Louis II. offered Wagner\r\nthe means of realizing the boldest and most sumptuous of his artistic\r\ndreams, but chiefly because he placed the prestige of his crown in\r\nthe service of the Wagnerian movement. Let us for a moment consider\r\nhow deeply monarchical is the disposition of the vast majority of\r\nthe German people; how the knees of the beery Philistine tremble as\r\nhe reverentially salutes even an empty court carriage; and how the\r\nhearts of well-bred maidens flutter with ineffable inspiration at the\r\nsight of a prince! And here was a real king, handsome as the day,\r\nyoung, surrounded by legends, whose mental infirmity was at that time\r\nregarded by all sentimentalists as sublime ‘idealism,’ displaying\r\nunbounded enthusiasm for an artist, and reviving on a far larger\r\nscale the relations between Charles Augustus and Goethe! From that\r\nmoment it was natural that Wagner should become the idol of all loyal\r\nhearts. To share in the royal taste for the ‘ideal’ was a thing to be\r\nproud of. Wagner’s music became provisionally a royal Bavarian music,\r\nadorned with crown and escutcheon, till it should subsequently become\r\nan imperial German music. At the head of the Wagnerian movement there\r\nwalks, as is fit, an insane king. Louis II. was able to bring Wagner\r\ninto vogue with the entire German nation (excepting, of course, those\r\nBavarians who were revolted by the King’s prodigalities); nevertheless,\r\nno amount of grovelling obsequiousness could by itself have produced\r\na fanaticism for Wagner. That the mere Wagner-fashion might attain to\r\nthis height another factor was necessary--the hysteria of the age.\r\n\r\nAlthough not so widespread as in France and England, this hysteria is\r\nnot wanting in Germany, where during the last quarter of a century it\r\nhas continued to gain ground. Germany has been longer protected from\r\nit than the civilized nations of the West by the smaller development\r\nof large industry and by the absence of large cities properly so\r\ncalled. In the last generation, however, both of these gifts have been\r\nabundantly accorded her, and two great wars have done the rest to\r\nmake the nervous system of the people susceptible to the pernicious\r\ninfluences of the city and the factory system.\r\n\r\nThe effect of war on the nerves of the participants has never been\r\nsystematically investigated; and yet how highly important and necessary\r\na work this would be! Science knows what disorders are produced in man\r\nby a single strong moral shock, _e.g._, a sudden mortal danger; it\r\nhas recorded hundreds and thousands of cases in which persons saved\r\nfrom drowning, or present at a fire on shipboard, or in a railway\r\naccident, or who have been threatened with assassination, etc., have\r\neither lost their reason, or been attacked by grave and protracted,\r\noften incurable, nervous illnesses. In war hundreds of thousands are\r\nexposed to all these fearful impressions at the same time. For months\r\ncruel mutilation or sudden death menaces them at every step. They are\r\nfrequently surrounded by the spectacle of devastation, conflagration,\r\nthe most appalling wounds, and heaps of corpses frightful to behold.\r\nMoreover, the greatest demands are made on their strength; they are\r\nforced to march until they break down, and cannot count on having\r\nadequate nourishment or sufficient sleep. And shall there not appear\r\namong these hundreds of thousands the effect which is proved to result\r\nfrom a single one of the occurrences which take place by thousands\r\nduring war? Let it not be said that in a campaign a soldier becomes\r\ncallous to the horrors encompassing him. That merely signifies that\r\nthey cease to excite the attention of his consciousness. They are\r\nnevertheless perceived by the senses and their cerebral centres, and\r\ntherefore leave their traces in the nervous system. That the soldier\r\ndoes not at the moment notice the deep shock--nay, even shattering--he\r\nhas experienced, equally proves nothing. ‘Traumatic hysteria,’ ‘railway\r\nspine,’ the nervous maladies consequent on a moral shock, are also\r\nfrequently unobserved until months after the event occasioning them.\r\n\r\nIn my belief, it can scarcely be doubted that every great war is a\r\ncause of hysteria among multitudes, and that far the larger number of\r\nsoldiers, even completely unknown to themselves, bring home from a\r\ncampaign a somewhat deranged nervous system. Of course this is much\r\nless applicable to the conquerors than to the conquered, for the\r\nfeeling of triumph is one of the most pleasurable the human brain can\r\nexperience, and the force-producing (‘dynamogenous’) effect of this\r\npleasurable feeling is well qualified to counteract the destructive\r\ninfluences of the impressions produced by war. But it is difficult\r\nfor it to entirely annul these impressions, and the victors, like the\r\nvanquished, no doubt leave a large part of their nervous strength and\r\nmoral health on the battlefield and in the bivouac.\r\n\r\nThe brutalization of the masses after every war has become a\r\ncommonplace. The expression originates in the perception that after a\r\ncampaign the tone of the people becomes fiercer and rougher, and that\r\nstatistics show more acts of violence. The fact is correctly stated,\r\nbut the interpretation is superficial. If the soldier on returning home\r\nbecomes more short-tempered, and even has recourse to the knife, it is\r\nnot because the war has made him rougher, but because it has made him\r\nmore excitable. This increased excitability is, however, only one of\r\nthe forms of the phenomenon of nervous debility.\r\n\r\nHence under the action of the two great wars in connection with\r\nthe development of large industries and the growth of large towns,\r\nhysteria among the German people has, since 1870, increased in an\r\nextraordinary manner, and we have very nearly overtaken the unenviable\r\nstart which the English and French had over us in this direction.\r\nNow, all hysteria, like every form of insanity, and for that matter\r\nlike every disease, receives its special form from the personality\r\nof the invalid. The degree of culture, the character, propensities\r\nand habits of the deranged person give the derangement its peculiar\r\ncolour. Among the English, always piously inclined, degeneration and\r\nhysteria were bound to appear both mystical and religious. Among the\r\nFrench, with their highly developed taste and widespread fondness for\r\nall artistic pursuits, it was natural that hysteria should take an\r\nartistic direction, and lead to the notorious extravagances in their\r\npainting, literature and music. We Germans are in general neither very\r\npious nor very cultivated in matters of art. Our comprehension of the\r\nbeautiful in art expresses itself, for the most part, in the idiotic\r\n‘_Reizend!_’ (charming), and ‘_Entzückend!_’ (ravishing), squeaked in\r\nshrill head-tones and with upturned eyes by our well-bred daughters at\r\nthe sight of a quaintly-shaved poodle, and before the Darmstadt Madonna\r\nby Holbein, indiscriminately; and in the grunts of satisfaction with\r\nwhich the plain citizen pumps in his beer at a concert of his singing\r\nclub. Not that we are by nature devoid of a sense of the beautiful--I\r\nbelieve, on the contrary, that in our deepest being we have more of it\r\nthan most other nations--but owing to unfavourable circumstances this\r\nsense has not been able to attain development. Since the Thirty Years’\r\nWar we have been too poor, we have had too hard a struggle for the\r\nnecessities of life to have anything left for any sort of luxury; and\r\nour ruling classes, profoundly Latinized and slaves to French fashion,\r\nwere so estranged from the masses, that for the last two centuries\r\nthe latter could have no part in the culture, taste, or æsthetic\r\nsatisfactions of the upper strata of society, separated from them by an\r\nimpassable gulf. As, therefore, the large majority of the German people\r\nhad no interest in art, and troubled themselves little about it, German\r\nhysteria could not assume an artistic, æsthetic form.\r\n\r\nIt assumed other forms, partly abominable, partly ignoble and partly\r\nlaughable. German hysteria manifests itself in anti-Semitism, that most\r\ndangerous form of the persecution-mania, in which the person believing\r\nhimself persecuted becomes a savage persecutor, capable of all crimes\r\n(the _persécuté persécuteur_ of the French mental therapeutics).[209]\r\nLike hypochondriacs and ‘hémorroïdaires,’ the German hysterical\r\nsubject is anxiously concerned about his precious health. His crazes\r\nhinge on the exhalations of his skin and the functions of his\r\nstomach. He becomes a fanatic for Jaeger vests, and for the groats\r\nwhich vegetarians grind for themselves. He gets vehemently affected\r\nover Kneipp’s douches and barefoot perambulations on wet grass. At\r\nthe same time, he excites himself with morbid sentimentalism (the\r\n‘Zoophilia’ of Magnan) concerning the sufferings of the frog, utilized\r\nin physiological experiments, and through all this anti-Semitic,\r\nKneippish, Jaegerish, vegetarian, and anti-vivisection insanity, there\r\nrings out the fundamental note of a megalomaniacal, Teutonomaniacal\r\nChauvinism, against which the noble Emperor Frederick vainly warned\r\nus. As a rule, all these derangements appear simultaneously, and in\r\nnine out of ten cases it is safe to take the proudly strutting wearer\r\nof Jaeger’s garments for a Chauvinist, the Kneipp visionary for a\r\ngroats-dieted maniac, and the defender of the frog, thirsting for the\r\nprofessor’s blood, for an anti-Semitist.\r\n\r\nWagner’s hysteria assumed the collective form of German hysteria. With\r\na slight modification of Terence’s _Homo sum_, he could say of himself,\r\n‘I am a deranged being, and no kind of derangement is a stranger to\r\nme.’ He could as an anti-Semitist give points to Stoecker.[210] He has\r\nan inimitable mastery of Chauvinistic phraseology.[211] Was he not able\r\nto convince his hypnotized hysterical following that the heroes of his\r\npieces were primeval German figures--these Frenchmen and Brabanters,\r\nthese Icelanders and Norwegians, these women of Palestine--all the\r\nfabulous beings he had fetched from the poems of Provence and Northern\r\nFrance, and from the Northern saga, who (with the exception of\r\n_Tannhäuser_ and the _Meistersinger_) have not a single drop of German\r\nblood or a single German fibre in their whole body? It is thus that, in\r\npublic exhibitions, a quack hypnotist persuades his victims that they\r\nare eating peaches instead of raw potatoes. Wagner became an advocate\r\nfor vegetarianism, and as the fruit needed for the nourishment of the\r\npeople in accordance with this diet exists in abundance only in warm\r\nregions of the earth, he promptly advised ‘the direction of a rational\r\nemigration to lands resembling the South American peninsula, which,\r\nit has been affirmed, might, through its superabundant productivity,\r\nsupply nourishment for the present population of the entire\r\nglobe.’[212] He brandishes his knightly sword against the physiologists\r\nwho experiment on animals.[213] He was not an enthusiast for wool,\r\nbecause personally he preferred silk; and this is the only hiatus\r\nin the otherwise complete picture. He did not live to witness the\r\ngreatness of the reverend Pastor Kneipp, otherwise he probably would\r\nhave found words of profound significance for the primitive German\r\nsanctity of wet feet, and the redeeming power vested in the knee-douche.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the enthusiastic friendship of King Louis had given\r\nWagner the necessary prestige, and directed the universal attention of\r\nGermany to him; when the German people had learned to know him and his\r\npeculiarities, then all the mystics of the Jewish sacrifice of blood,\r\nof woollen shirts, of the vegetable _menu_, and sympathy cures, were\r\ncompelled to raise their pæans in his honour, for he was the embodiment\r\nof all their obsessions. As for his music, they simply threw that into\r\nthe bargain. The vast majority of Wagner fanatics understood nothing of\r\nit. The emotional excitement which the works of their idol made them\r\nexperience did not proceed from the singers and the orchestra, but in\r\npart from the pictorial beauty of the scenic tableaux, and in a greater\r\nmeasure from the specific craze each brought with him to the theatre,\r\nand of which each worshipped Wagner as the spokesman and champion.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, go so far as to assert that _skat_[214] patriotism,\r\nand the heroic idealism of natural cures, rice with fruit, ‘away with\r\nthe Jews!’ and flannel, alone made the hearts of Wagner-bigots beat\r\nfaster in blissful emotion when they were listening to his music.\r\nThis music was certainly of a nature to fascinate the hysterical. Its\r\npowerful orchestral effects produced in them hypnotic states (at the\r\nSalpêtrière hospital in Paris the hypnotic state is often induced by\r\nsuddenly striking a gong), and the formlessness of the unending melody\r\nwas exactly suited to the dreamy vagaries of their own thought. A\r\ndistinct melody awakens and demands attention, and is hence opposed to\r\nthe fugitive ideation of the weak brains of the degenerate. A flowing\r\nrecitative, on the contrary, without beginning or end, makes no sort\r\nof demand on the mind--for most auditors trouble themselves either\r\nnot at all, or for a very short time, about the hide-and-seek play of\r\nthe _leit-motif_--one can allow one’s self to be swayed and carried\r\nalong by it, and to emerge from it at pleasure, without any definite\r\nremembrance, but with a merely sensual feeling of having enjoyed a\r\nhot, nervously exciting tone-bath. The relation of true melody to the\r\nunending melody is the same as that of a genre or historical painting\r\nto the wayward arabesques of a Moorish mural decoration, repeated a\r\nthousand times, and representing nothing definite; and the Oriental\r\nknows how favourable the sight of his arabesques is to ‘Kef’--that\r\ndreamy state in which Reason is lulled to sleep, and crazy Imagination\r\nalone rules as mistress of the house.\r\n\r\nWagner’s music initiated hysterically-minded Germans into the mysteries\r\nof Turkish Kef. Nietzsche may make sport of this subject with his\r\nidiotic play on words ‘_Sursum_--bum-bum,’ and with his remarks about\r\nthe German youth who seeks for ‘Ahnung’ (presentiments); but the\r\nfact is not to be denied that a part of Wagner’s devotees--those who\r\nbrought a diseased mysticism with them to the theatre--found in him\r\ntheir satisfaction; for nothing is so well qualified to conjure up\r\n‘presentiments,’ _i.e._, ambiguous, shadowy borderland presentations,\r\nas a music which is itself born of nebulous adumbrations of thought.\r\n\r\nHysterical women were won over to Wagner chiefly by the lascivious\r\neroticism of his music, but also by his poetic representation of the\r\nrelation of man to woman. Nothing enchants an ‘intense’ woman so much\r\nas demoniacal irresistibleness on the part of the woman, and trembling\r\nadoration of her supernatural power on the part of the man. In contrast\r\nto Frederick William I., who cried in anger, ‘You should not fear, but\r\nlove me,’ women of this sort would rather shout to every man, ‘You are\r\nnot to love me, but to lie, full of dread and terror, in the dust at my\r\nfeet.’ ‘Frau’ Venus, Brunhilde, Isolde, and Kundry have won for Wagner\r\nmuch more admiration among women than have Elizabeth, Elsa, Senta, and\r\nGudrune.\r\n\r\nAfter Wagner had once conquered Germany, and a fervent faith in him\r\nhad been made the first article in the catechism of German patriotism,\r\nforeign countries could not long withstand his cult. The admiration\r\nof a great people has an extraordinary power of conviction. Even its\r\naberrations it forces with irresistible suggestion on other nations.\r\nWagner was one of the foremost conquerors in the German wars. Sadowa\r\nand Sedan were fought in his behalf. The world, _nolens volens_, had to\r\ntake up its attitude with regard to a man whom Germany proclaimed its\r\nnational composer. He began his triumphal march round the globe draped\r\nin the flag of Imperial Germany. Germany’s enemies were his enemies,\r\nand this forced even such Germans as withstood his influence to take\r\nhis side against foreign lands. ‘I beat my breast: I, too, have fought\r\nfor him against the French in speech and writing. I also have defended\r\nhim against the pastrycooks who hissed his _Lohengrin_ in Paris.’ How\r\nwas one to get off this duty? Hamlet thrusts at the arras, well knowing\r\nthat Polonius stands there; hence any son or brother of Polonius is\r\nbound resolutely to attack Hamlet. Wagner had the good fortune to play\r\nthe part of the tapestry to the French Hamlets, giving them the pretext\r\nfor thrusting at the Polonius of Germany. As a result, the attitude in\r\nthe Wagner question of every German was rigidly prescribed for him.\r\n\r\nTo the zeal of Germans all manner of other things added their aid in\r\nfavouring the success of Wagner abroad. A minority, composed in part\r\nof really independent men of honorably unprejudiced minds, but in part\r\nalso of degenerate minds with a morbid passion for contradiction, took\r\nsides with him just because he was blindly and furiously maligned by\r\nthe Chauvinist majority, who were a prey to national hatred. ‘It is\r\ncontemptible,’ cried the minority, ‘to condemn an artist because he is\r\na German. Art has no fatherland. Wagner’s music should not be judged\r\nwith the memory of Alsace-Lorraine.’ These views are so reasonable\r\nand noble, that those who entertained them must have rejoiced in them\r\nand been proud of them. On listening to Wagner, they had the clear\r\nfeeling, ‘We are better and cleverer than the Chauvinists,’ and this\r\nfeeling necessarily placed them at the outset in such an agreeable and\r\nbenevolent mood, that his music seemed much more beautiful than they\r\nwould have found it if they had not been obliged first to stifle their\r\nvulgar and base instincts, and fortify those which were more elevated,\r\nfree and refined. They erroneously ascribed to Wagner’s music the\r\nemotions produced by their self-satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe fact that only in Bayreuth could this ‘music be heard, unfalsified\r\nand in its full strength, was also of great importance for the\r\nesteem in which it was held. If it had been played in every theatre,\r\nif, without trouble and formalities, one could have gone to a\r\nrepresentation of Wagner as to one of _Il Trovatore_, Wagner would not\r\nhave obtained his most enthusiastic public from foreign countries. To\r\nknow the real Wagner it was necessary to journey to Bayreuth. This\r\ncould be done only at long intervals and at specified times; seats and\r\nlodgings had to be obtained long in advance, and at great expenditure\r\nof trouble. It was a pilgrimage requiring much money and leisure; hence\r\n‘hoi polloi’ were excluded from it. Thus, the pilgrimage to Bayreuth\r\nbecame a privilege of the rich and well-bred, and to have been to\r\nBayreuth came to be a great social distinction among the snobs of\r\nboth worlds. The journey was a thing to make a great parade of and be\r\nhaughty over. The pilgrim no longer belonged to the vulgar crowd, but\r\nto the select few; he became a hadji! Oriental sages so well know the\r\npeculiar vanity of the hadjis, that one of their proverbs contains an\r\nexpress warning against the pious man who has been thrice to Mecca.\r\n\r\nHence the pilgrimage to Bayreuth became a mark of aristocracy, and\r\nan appreciation of Wagner’s music, in spite of his nationality, was\r\nregarded as evidence of intellectual preeminence. The prejudice in\r\nhis favour was created, and provided one went to him in this mood,\r\nthere was no reason why Wagner should not have the same influence\r\non hysterical foreigners as on hysterical Germans. _Parsifal_ was\r\nespecially fitted completely to subjugate the French neo-Catholics and\r\nAnglo-American mystics who marched behind the banner of the Salvation\r\nArmy. It was with this opera that Wagner chiefly triumphed among his\r\nnon-German admirers. Listening to the music of _Parsifal_ has become\r\nthe religious act of all those who wish to receive the Communion in\r\nmusical form.\r\n\r\nThese are the explanatory causes of Wagner’s conquest, first\r\nof Germany, and then of the world. The absence of judgment and\r\nindependence among the multitude, who chant the antiphony in the\r\nPsalter; the imitation of musicians possessed of no originality, who\r\nwitnessed his triumph, and, like genuine little boys wanting ‘to be\r\ntaken,’ clung to his coat-tails--these did what was still needed to\r\nlay the world at his feet. As it is the most widely diffused, so is\r\nWagnerism the most momentous aberration of the present time. The\r\nBayreuth festival theatre, the _Bayreuther Blätter_, the Parisian\r\n_Revue Wagnérienne_, are lasting monuments by which posterity will be\r\nable to measure the whole breadth and depth of the degeneration and\r\nhysteria of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPARODIES OF MYSTICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE artistic and poetic forms of mysticism, which we have studied\r\nhitherto, might perhaps inspire doubts in superficial or insufficiently\r\ninstructed minds as to their origin in degeneration, and present\r\nthemselves as manifestations of a genuine and fertile talent. But\r\nbeside them appear others, in which a state of mind reveals itself\r\nwhich suddenly arrests and perplexes any reader, however credulous,\r\nand however accessible to the suggestion of printed words, and to\r\nself-puffing charlatanism. Books and theories find publication, in\r\nwhich even the unlearned observe the deep intellectual degradation of\r\ntheir authors. One pretends to be able to initiate the reader into the\r\nblack art, and enable him to practise magic himself; another gives a\r\npoetical form to definitely insane ideas, such as have been classified\r\nby mental therapeutics; a third writes books as if prompted by thoughts\r\nand feelings worthy of little children or idiots. A great part of the\r\nworks I have in view would justify, without further consideration, the\r\nplacing of their authors under constraint. As, however, in spite of\r\ntheir manifest craziness, well-known critics are bent upon discovering\r\nin them ‘the future,’ ‘fresh nerve-stimulations,’ and beauties of a\r\nmysterious kind, and to puff them by their chatter to gaping simpletons\r\nas revelations of genius, it is not superfluous to devote some brief\r\nconsideration to them.\r\n\r\nA not very large amount of mysticism leads to belief; a larger\r\namount leads necessarily to superstition, and the more confused, the\r\nmore deranged, the mind is, so much the crazier will be the kind of\r\nsuperstition. In England and America this most frequently takes the\r\nform of spiritualism and the founding of sects. The hysterical and\r\nderanged receive spiritual inspirations, and begin to preach and\r\nprophesy, or they conjure up spirits and commune with the dead. In\r\nEnglish fiction ghost-stories have begun to occupy a large place, and\r\nin English newspapers to act glibly as stopgaps, as was done formerly\r\nin the Continental press by the sea-serpent and the Flying Dutchman.\r\nA society has been formed which has for its object the collecting of\r\nghost-stories, and testing their authenticity; and even literary men\r\nof renown have been seized with the vertigo of the supernatural, and\r\ncondescend to serve as vouchers for the most absurd aberrations.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, too, spiritualism has found an entrance, although, on the\r\nwhole, it has not gained much ground. In the large towns there may be\r\nsome small spiritualist bodies. The English expression _trance_ has\r\nbecome so familiar to some deranged persons that they have adopted\r\nit in German as _trans_, imagining apparently, with the popular\r\netymology, that it means ‘beyond’ instead of ‘ecstasy,’ or, in other\r\nwords, the state in which, according to the spiritualist hypothesis,\r\nthe medium ought to find himself who enters into communication with\r\nthe world of spirits. Nevertheless, spiritualism has as yet exerted\r\nlittle influence on our literature. Excluding the later romanticists\r\nwho have fallen into childishness, notably the authors of tragedies\r\nbased on the idea of ‘fatality’ (_Schicksalstragödien_), few writers\r\nhave dared to introduce the supernatural into their creations otherwise\r\nthan allegorically. At most in Kleist and Kerner it attains a certain\r\nimportance, and healthy readers do not consider that as a merit in the\r\ndramas of the unfortunate author of the _Hermannsschlacht_, and in the\r\n_Seer of Prevorst_ of the Swabian poet. On the other hand, it must\r\ncertainly be noted that it is the ghost element precisely which has\r\nbrought to these two writers, in recent times, a renewal of youth and\r\npopularity among degenerate and hysterical Germans. Maximilian Perty,\r\nwho was evidently born too soon, met with but rare and even rather\r\nderisive notice from the less soft-headed generation which preceded\r\nours, for his bulky books on apparitions. And, among contemporaries,\r\nnone but Freiherr Karl du Prel has chosen the spirit world as the\r\nspecial subject of his theoretic writings and novels. After all, our\r\nplays, our tales, are very little haunted, scarcely enough to make a\r\nschoolgirl shiver; and even among the eminent foreign authors best\r\nknown in Germany, such, for example, as Tourgenieff, it is not the\r\nworld of apparitions which attracts German readers.\r\n\r\nThe few ghost-seers whom we have at present in Germany endeavour\r\nnaturally to give their mental derangement a scientific colouring, and\r\nappeal to individual professors of mathematics and natural science who\r\nhappen entirely to agree with them, or are supposed to be partially\r\ninclined to do so. However, their one sheet-anchor is Zöllner, who is\r\nsimply a sad proof of the fact that a professorship is no protection\r\nfrom madness; and they can besides, at any rate, point to opportune\r\nremarks of Helmholtz and other mathematicians on _n_ dimensions, which\r\nthey, either intentionally or from mystical weakness of mind, have\r\nmisunderstood. In an analytical problem the mathematician, instead\r\nof one, two, or three dimensions, may place _n_ dimensions without\r\naltering thereby the law of the problem and its legitimately resulting\r\ncorollaries, but it does not occur to him to imagine, under the\r\ngeometrical expression, ‘nth dimension,’ something given in space, and\r\ncapable of being apprehended by the senses. When Zöllner gives the\r\nwell-known example of the inversion of the india-rubber ring which,\r\nbecause only possible in the third dimension, necessarily appeared\r\nquite inconceivable and supernatural to a bi-dimensional being, he\r\nbelieves that he facilitates the comprehension of the formation of\r\na knot in a closed ring as an operation practicable in the fourth\r\ndimension. In doing this he simply offers one more example of the known\r\ntendency of the mystic to delude himself, as he does others, with words\r\nwhich seem to signify something, and which a simpleton is convinced\r\noftener than not that he understands, but which in reality express no\r\nidea, and are, therefore, empty sound, void of import.\r\n\r\nFrance is about to become the promised land of believers in ghosts.\r\nVoltaire’s countrymen have already got the start of the pious\r\nAnglo-Saxons in dealings with the supernatural. I am not now thinking\r\nof the lower ranks of the people, among whom the book of dreams (_La\r\nClé des Songes_) has never ceased to constitute the family library,\r\ntogether with the Calendar, and, perhaps, the ‘Paroissien’ (missal);\r\nnor of the fine ladies who at all times have ensured excellent\r\nincomes to clairvoyantes and fortune-tellers; but only of the male\r\nrepresentatives of the educated classes. Dozens of spiritualist circles\r\ncount their numbers by thousands. In numerous drawing-rooms of the\r\nbest (even in the opinion of the ‘most cultured’!) society, the dead\r\nare called up. A monthly publication, _L’Initiation_, announces, in\r\nweighty tones, and with a prodigality of philosophical and scientific\r\ntechnicalities, the esoteric doctrine of the marvels of the unearthly.\r\nA bi-monthly publication, _Annales des Sciences Psychiques_, terms\r\nitself a ‘collection of observations and researches.’ Next to these two\r\nmost important periodicals, a whole series of others exist, similar in\r\ntendency, and all having a wide circulation. Strictly technical works\r\non hypnotism and suggestion run through edition after edition, and it\r\nhas become a profitable speculation for doctors without practice, who\r\ndo not attach much importance to the opinions of their colleagues,\r\nto compile so-called manuals and text-books on these subjects, which\r\nscientifically are completely worthless, but which are bought up by the\r\npublic like hot rolls. Novels have, with rare exceptions, no longer any\r\nsale in France, but works on obscure phenomena of nerve function go off\r\nsplendidly, so that sagacious publishers give their discouraged authors\r\nthis advice: ‘Leave novels for a time, and write on magnetism.’\r\n\r\nSome of the books on magic which have appeared of late years in\r\nFrance connect their subject directly with the phenomena of hypnotism\r\nand suggestion; for example, A. De Rochas’ _Les États profonds de\r\nl’Hypnose_, and C. A. de Bodisco’s _Traits de Lumière_, or ‘physical\r\nresearches dedicated to unbelievers and egoists.’ This has brought\r\nmany observers to the idea that the works and discoveries of the\r\nCharcot school in general have given the impulse to the whole of this\r\nmovement. Hypnotism, say the representatives of this opinion, has\r\nbrought such remarkable facts to light that the accuracy of certain\r\ntraditions, popular beliefs and old records can no longer be doubted,\r\nthough hitherto they have been generally considered inventions of\r\nsuperstition; possession, witch-spells, second-sight, healing by\r\nimposition of hands, prophecy, mental communication at the remotest\r\ndistance without the intervention of words, have received a new\r\ninterpretation and have been recognised as possible. What, then, more\r\nnatural than that minds weak in balance, and of insufficient scientific\r\ntraining, should become accessible to the marvellous (against which\r\nthey had shielded themselves, as long as they considered it to be all\r\nold nurses’ fables), when they saw it appear in the garb of science,\r\nand found themselves in the best society by believing in it?\r\n\r\nPlausible as this opinion is, it is not the less false. It puts the\r\ncart before the horse. It confounds cause with effect. No completely\r\nsound mind has been led by the experiences of the new hypnotic science\r\ninto a belief in the marvellous. In former times no attention was paid\r\nto obscure phenomena, or they were passed by with eyes intentionally\r\nclosed, because they could not be fitted in to the prevailing system,\r\nand were consequently held to be chimæras or frauds. For the last\r\ntwelve years official science has taken cognizance of them, and\r\nFaculties and Academies are engaged upon them. But no one thinks\r\nof them for a moment as supernatural, or supposes the working of\r\nunearthly forces behind them. They class them with all other natural\r\nphenomena which are accessible to the observation of the senses, and\r\nare determined by the ordinary laws of nature. Our knowledge has simply\r\nenlarged its frame, and admitted an order of facts which in former\r\ntimes had remained beyond its pale. Many processes of hypnosis are\r\nmore or less satisfactorily explained; others as yet not at all. But\r\nan earnest and healthy mind attaches no great importance to this, for\r\nhe knows that the pretended explanation of phenomena does not go very\r\nfar, and that we have mostly to be satisfied to determine them with\r\ncertainty, and to know their immediate conditions. I do not say that\r\nthe new science has exhausted its subject and has reached its limits.\r\nBut whatever it may bring to light of the unknown and the unexpected,\r\nit is not a matter of doubt to the healthy mind that it will be\r\naccounted for by natural means, and that the simple, ultimate laws of\r\nphysics, chemistry and biology cannot be shaken by these discoveries.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, so many people now interpret the phenomena of hypnosis\r\nas supernatural, and indulge the hope that the conjuration of\r\nthe spirits of the dead, aerial voyages on Faust’s magic cloak,\r\nomniscience, etc., will soon be arts as common as reading and writing,\r\nit is not the discoveries of science which have brought them to this\r\ndelusion, although the existing delusion is happy to be able to pass\r\nitself off for science. Far from concealing itself, as formerly, it\r\nexhibits itself proudly in the streets on the arms of professors and\r\nacademicians. Paulhan understands the matter very well: ‘It is not the\r\nlove of positive facts,’ he says,[215] ‘which has carried minds away;\r\nthere has been a certain kind of return for the love of the marvellous\r\nin desires formerly satisfied, and which, now repressed, slumbered\r\nunacknowledged in a latent condition. Magic, sorcery, astrology,\r\ndivination, all these ancient beliefs correspond to a need of human\r\nnature; that of being able easily to act upon the external world and\r\nthe social world; that of possessing, by means relatively easy, the\r\nknowledge requisite to make this action possible and fruitful.’ The\r\nstormy outburst of superstition has by no means been let loose through\r\nhypnological researches; it merely launches itself into the channels\r\nthey have dug. We have here already repeatedly drawn attention to the\r\nfact that unbalanced minds always adapt their crazes to the prevailing\r\nviews, and usurp by predilection the most recent discoveries of\r\nscience to explain them. The physicists were still far from occupying\r\nthemselves with magnetism and electricity, when the persons attacked\r\nby persecution-mania were already referring their own unpleasant\r\nsensations and hallucinations to the electric currents or sparks which\r\ntheir persecutors were supposed to cast on them through walls, ceilings\r\nand floors; and in our days the degenerate were equally the first to\r\nappropriate to themselves the results of hypnological researches, and\r\nto employ them as ‘scientific’ proofs of the reality of spirits, angels\r\nand devils. But the degenerate started with the belief in miracles; it\r\nis one of their peculiar characteristics,[216] and it was not first\r\ncalled forth by the observations of Parisian and Nancy hypnologists.\r\n\r\nIf another proof were needed in support of this affirmation, it could\r\nbe found in the fact that the greater number of ‘occultists,’ as they\r\ncall themselves, in their treatises on occult arts and magic sciences,\r\nscorn to fall back on the results of hypnological experiments, and,\r\nwithout any pretext of ‘modernity,’ without any concession to honest\r\ninvestigation of nature, have direct recourse to the most ancient\r\ntraditions. Papus (the pseudonym of a physician, Dr. Encausse) writes\r\na _Traité méthodique de Science occulte_, an enormous large-octavo\r\nvolume of 1,050 pages, with 400 illustrations, which introduces the\r\nreader to the cabala, magic, necromancy and cheiromancy, astrology,\r\nalchemy, etc., and to which an old, not undeserving savant, Adolf\r\nFranck, of the Institute of France, was imprudent enough to write a\r\nlong eulogistic preface, presumably without having even opened the book\r\nhimself. Stanislaus de Guaita, revered with awe by the adepts as past\r\nmaster in the Black Art, and arch-magician, gives two treatises, _Au\r\nSeuil du Mystère and Le Serpent de la Genèse_, so darkly profound that,\r\nin comparison, Nicolas Flamel, the great alchemist, whom no mortal\r\nhas ever comprehended, seems clear and transparent as crystal. Ernest\r\nBose confines himself to the theory of the sorcery of the ancient\r\nEgyptians. His book, _Isis dévoilée, ou l’Egyptologie sacrée_, has\r\nfor the sub-title: ‘Hieroglyphics, papyri, hermetic books, religion,\r\nmyths, symbols, psychology, philosophy, morals, sacred art, occultism,\r\nmysteries, initiation, music.’ Nehor has likewise his speciality. If\r\nBosc unveils Egyptian mysteries, Nehor reveals the secrets of Assyria\r\nand Babylonia. _Les Mages et le Secret magique_ is the name of the\r\nmodest pamphlet in which he initiates us into the profoundest magic\r\narts of the Chaldean Mobeds, or Knights Templars.\r\n\r\nIf I do not enter more fully into these books, which have found readers\r\nand admirers, it is because I am not quite certain that they are\r\nintended to be in earnest. Their authors read and translate so fluently\r\nEgyptian, Hebraic and Assyriac texts, which no professional Orientalist\r\nhas yet deciphered; they quote so frequently and so copiously from\r\nbooks which are found in no library in the world; they give with\r\nsuch an imperturbable air exact instructions how to resuscitate the\r\ndead, how to preserve eternal youth, how to hold intercourse with the\r\ninhabitants of Sirius, how to divine beyond all the limits of time and\r\nspace, that one cannot get rid of the impression that they wished, in\r\ncold blood, to make fun of the reader.\r\n\r\nOnly one of all these master-sorcerers is certainly to be taken in\r\ngood faith, and as he is at the same time intellectually the most\r\neminent among them, I will deal with him somewhat more in detail.\r\nThis is M. Joséphin Péladan. He has even arrogated to himself the\r\nAssyrian royal title of ‘Sar,’ under which he is generally known.\r\nThe public authorities alone do not give him his Sar title; but then\r\nthey do not usually recognise any titles of nobility in France. He\r\nmaintains he is the descendant of the old Magi, and the possessor of\r\nall the mental legacies of Zoroaster, Pythagoras and Orpheus. He is,\r\nmoreover, the direct heir of the Knights Templars and Rosicrucians,\r\nboth of which orders he has amalgamated and revived under a new form\r\nas the ‘Order of the Rosy Cross.’ He dresses himself archaically in\r\na satin doublet of blue or black; he trims his extremely luxuriant\r\nblue-black hair and beard into the shape in use among the Assyrians;\r\nhe affects a large upright hand, which might be taken for mediæval\r\ncharacter, writes by preference with red or yellow ink, and in the\r\ncorner of his letter-paper is delineated, as a distinctive mark of\r\nhis dignity, the Assyrian king’s cap, with the three serpentine\r\nrolls opening in front. As a coat of arms he has the device of his\r\norder; on an escutcheon divided by sable and argent a golden chalice\r\nsurmounted by a crimson rose with two outspread wings, and overlaid\r\nwith a Latin cross in sable. The shield is surmounted by a coronet\r\nwith three pentagrams as indents. M. Péladan has appointed a series of\r\ncommanders and dignitaries of his order (‘grand-priors,’ ‘archons,’\r\n‘æsthetes’), which numbers, besides, ‘postulants’ and ‘grammarians’\r\n(scholars). He possesses a special costume as grand-master and Sar (in\r\nwhich his life-sized portrait has been painted by Alexandre Séon), and\r\na composer, who belongs to the order, has composed for him a special\r\nfanfare, which on solemn occasions is to be played by trumpets at his\r\nentrance. He makes use of extraordinary formulæ. His letters he calls\r\n‘decrees,’ or commands (_mandements_). He addresses the persons to whom\r\nthey are directed either as ‘magnifiques,’ or ‘peers,’ sometimes also\r\n‘dearest adelphe,’ or ‘synnoède.’ He does not call them ‘sir,’ but\r\n‘your lordship’ (_seigneurie_). The introduction is: ‘Health, light\r\nand victory in Jesus Christ, in the only God, and in Peter, the only\r\nking’; or ‘_Ad Rosam per Crucem, ad Crucem per Rosam, in eâ, in eis\r\ngemmatus resurgam_.’ This is at the same time the heraldic motto of\r\nthe Order of the Rosy Cross. At the conclusion is usually, ‘_Amen. Non\r\nnobis, Domine, non nobis, sed nominis tui gloriæ solæ._’ He writes the\r\nname of his order, with a cross inserted in the middle, thus: ‘_Rose_\r\n✠ _Croix._’ His novels he calls ‘_éthopées_,’ himself as their author\r\n‘_éthopoète_,’ his dramas ‘_wagneries_,’ their table of contents\r\n‘_éumolpées_.’\r\n\r\nEvery one of his books is ornamented with a large number of symbols.\r\nThat which appears the most often is a vignette showing on a column\r\na cowering form with the head of a woman breathing flames, and with\r\na woman’s breast, lion’s paws, and the lower part of the body of a\r\nwasp or dragon-fly, terminating in an appendage similar to the tail\r\nof a fish. The work itself is always preceded by some prefaces,\r\nintroductions and invocations, and is often followed by pages of\r\nthe same nature. I take as an example the book entitled, _Comment\r\non devient Mage_.[217] After the two title-pages adorned with a\r\ngreat number of symbolical images (winged Assyrian bulls, the mystic\r\nrose cross, etc.), comes a long dedication ‘to Count Antoine de la\r\nRochefoucauld, grand-prior of the temple, archon of the Rose ✠ Cross.’\r\nThen follows in Latin a ‘prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas, well suited to\r\nwarn the reader against the possible errors of this book’; after this,\r\nan _élenctique_ (counter-demonstration) containing a sort of profession\r\nof Catholic faith; next, an ‘invocation to ancestors’ in the style of\r\nthe Chaldean prayers; lastly, a long allocution ‘to the contemporary\r\nyoung man,’ after which the book properly begins.\r\n\r\nAt the head of every chapter appear nine mysterious formulæ. Here are\r\ntwo examples: ‘I. The Neophyte. Divine Name: Jud (the Hebrew letter\r\nso called). Sacrament: Baptism. Virtue: Faith. Gift: Fear of God.\r\nBeatitude: Poor in spirit. Work: Teaching. Angel: Michael. Arcanum:\r\nUnity. Planet: Samas. II. Society. Divine Name: Jah--El (in Hebrew\r\ncharacters, which Péladan evidently cannot read, for he turns it into\r\nEl-lah). Sacrament: Consecration. Virtue: Hope. Gift: Pity. Beatitude:\r\nGentleness. Work: Counsel. Angel: Gabriel. Arcanum: Duality. Planet:\r\nSin.’\r\n\r\nOf the further contents of this mighty volume I think no examples need\r\nbe given. They correspond exactly with the headings of these chapters.\r\n\r\nThe novels or ‘éthopées’ of M. Péladan, of which nine have appeared\r\nhitherto, but of which the author has announced fourteen, are arranged\r\nin groups of seven, the mystical number. He has even established a\r\n_Schéma de Concordance_,[218] which claims to give a synopsis of their\r\nleading ideas. Let us hear how he explains his works:\r\n\r\n‘First series of seven: I. The supreme vice. Moral and mental Diathesis\r\nof the Latin decline--Merodach, summit of conscious will, type of\r\nabsolute entity; Alta, prototype of the monk in contact with the\r\nworld; Courtenay, inadequate man-of-fate, bewitched by social facts;\r\nL. d’Este, extreme pride, the grand style in evil; Coryse, the true\r\nyoung maiden; La Nine, the wicked Androgyne, or, better, Gynander;\r\nDominicaux, conscious reprobate, character of the irremediable,\r\nresulting from a specious æsthetic theory for every vice, which kills\r\nconsciousness and, in consequence, conversion. Every novel has a\r\nMerodach, that is, an abstract Orphic principle, as opposed to an ideal\r\nenigma.\r\n\r\n‘II. Inquisitive. Parisian clinical collective-phenomenism. Ethics:\r\nNebo; the systematic, sentimental will. Erotics: Paula, passionate\r\nwith Androgynous Prism. The great horror, the Beast with two backs,\r\nin Gynander (IX.), metamorphosing itself into unisexual corruption.\r\nInquisitive, that is the everyday and the everybody of instinct.\r\nGynander, the Goethesque midnight, and the exceptional,’ etc.\r\n\r\nI have taken pains to reproduce faithfully all M. Péladan’s whimsical\r\nmethods of expression. That his _Concordance_ can give even the\r\nslightest idea of the contents of his novels, I do not for a moment\r\nbelieve. I will, therefore, say a few words about these in non-magian\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThey all move in the three following circles of ideas, variously\r\npenetrating and intersecting each other: The highest intellectual aim\r\nof man is to hear and thoroughly to appreciate Wagnerian music; the\r\nhighest development of morality consists in renouncing sexuality and\r\nin transforming one’s self into a hybrid hermaphrodite (Androgyne and\r\nGynander); the higher man can quit and retake his body at pleasure,\r\nsoar into space as an ‘astral being,’ and subject to his will the\r\nentire supernatural power of the world of spirits, of the good as well\r\nas the bad.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in every romance a hero appears who unites in himself the\r\ndistinctive marks of both sexes, and resists with horror the ordinary\r\nsexual instincts, who plays or enjoys the music of Wagner, enacts in\r\nhis own life some scene from the Wagnerian drama, and conjures up\r\nspirits or has to repel their attacks.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wishes to trace the origin of all these delirious ideas, it\r\nwill not be difficult to discover how they arose. One day while reading\r\nthe Bible Péladan alighted on the name of the Babylonian king, Merodach\r\nBaladan. The similarity of sound between ‘Baladan’ and ‘Péladan’ gave\r\nan impulse to his imagination to establish relations between himself\r\nand the Biblical Babylonian king. Once he began to reflect on this, he\r\nfound a resemblance, in the cast of his features, the colour of his\r\nhair, and the growth of his beard, to the heads of Assyrian kings on\r\nthe alabaster casts from the palace at Nineveh. Thus he easily arrived\r\nat the idea that he was possibly a descendant of Baladan, or of other\r\nAssyrian kings, or, at least, that it would be a curious thing if he\r\nwere. And he continued to work out this thought, until one day he\r\nresolutely took the title of Sar. If he were descended from the kings\r\nof Babylon, he could also be the heir of the wisdom of the Magi. So\r\nhe began to proclaim the Magian esoteric doctrine. To these musings\r\nwere added afterwards the impressions he received on a pilgrimage to\r\nBayreuth, from _Tristan_, and especially from _Parsifal_. In fancy\r\nhe wrought his own life into the legend of the Grail, looked upon\r\nhimself as a knight of the Grail, and created his order of the ‘Rose\r\nCroix,’ which is entirely composed of reminiscences of _Parsifal_.\r\nHis invention of the asexual hybrid being shows that his imagination\r\nis actively preoccupied with presentations of a sexual character, and\r\nunconsciously seeks to idealize the ‘contrary sexual feelings.’\r\n\r\nThe mental life of Péladan permits us to follow, in an extremely\r\nwell-marked instance, the ways of mystic thought. He is wholly\r\ndominated by the association of ideas. A fortuitous assonance\r\nawakens in him a train of thought which urges him irresistibly to\r\nproclaim himself an Assyrian king and Magus, without his attention\r\nbeing in a condition to make him realize the fact that a man can be\r\ncalled Péladan without being, therefore, necessarily descended from\r\na Biblical Baladan. The meaningless flow of words of the mediæval\r\nscholastics misleads him, because he is continually thinking by\r\nway of analogy, that is to say, because he follows exclusively the\r\nplay of the association of ideas provoked by the most secondary and\r\nsuperficial resemblances. He receives every artistic suggestion with\r\nthe greatest ease. If he hears Wagner’s operas, he believes himself\r\nto be a Wagnerian character; if he reads of the Knights Templars and\r\nRosicrucians, he becomes the Grand-Master of the Temple, and of all\r\nother secret orders. He has the peculiar sexual emotionalism of the\r\n‘higher degenerates,’ and this endows him with a peculiar fabulous\r\nshape, which, at once chaste and lascivious, embodies, in curiously\r\ndemonstrative manner, the secret conflicts which take place in his\r\nconsciousness between unhealthily intensified instincts, and the\r\njudgment which recognises their dangerous character.\r\n\r\nDoes Péladan believe in the reality of his delusions? In other words,\r\ndoes he take himself seriously? The answer to this question is not so\r\nsimple as many perhaps think. The two beings which exist in every human\r\nmind are, in a nature such as Péladan’s, a prey to a strange conflict.\r\nHis unconscious nature is quite transfused with the _rôle_ of a Sar,\r\na Magus, a Knight of the Holy Grail, Grand-Master of the Order, etc.,\r\nwhich he has invented. The conscious factor in him knows that it is\r\nall nonsense, but it finds artistic pleasure in it, and permits the\r\nunconscious life to do as it pleases. It is thus that little girls\r\nbehave who play with dolls, caressing or punishing them, and treating\r\nthem as if they were living beings, all the time well aware that in\r\nreality they have before them only an object in leather and porcelain.\r\n\r\nPéladan’s judgment has no power over his unconscious impulses. It is\r\nnot in his power to renounce the part of a Sar or a Magus, or no longer\r\nto pose as grand-master of an order. He cannot abstain from perpetually\r\nreturning to his ‘Androgynous’ absurdity. All these aberrations, as\r\nwell as the invention of neologisms and the predilection for symbols,\r\nthe prolix titles, and the casket-series of prefaces, so characteristic\r\nof the ‘higher degenerates,’ proceed from the depths of his organic\r\ntemperament, and evade the influence of his higher centres. On its\r\nconscious side Péladan’s cerebral activity is rich and beautiful.\r\nIn his novels there are pages which rank among the most splendid\r\nproductions of a contemporary pen. His moral ideal is high and noble.\r\nHe pursues with ardent hatred all that is base and vulgar, every form\r\nof egoism, falsehood, and thirst for pleasure; and his characters are\r\nthoroughly aristocratic souls, whose thoughts are concerned only with\r\nthe worthiest, if somewhat exclusively artistic, interests of humanity.\r\nIt is deeply to be regretted that the overgrowth of morbidly mystic\r\npresentations should render his extraordinary gifts completely sterile.\r\n\r\nFar below Péladan stands Maurice Rollinat, who ought, nevertheless, to\r\nbe mentioned first, because he embodies in a very instructive manner a\r\ndefinite form of mystic degeneration, and next because all French, and\r\nmany foreign, hysterical persons honour in him a great poet.\r\n\r\nIn his poems, which with characteristic self-knowledge he entitles\r\n_Les Névroses_[219] (Nervous Maladies) he betrays all the stigmata of\r\ndegeneration, which by this time ought to be familiar enough to the\r\nreader for me to content myself with a brief notice of them.\r\n\r\nHe feels in himself criminal impulses (_Le Fantôme du Crime_):\r\n\r\n‘Wicked thoughts come into my soul in every place, at all hours, in the\r\nheight of my work.... I listen in spite of myself to the infernal tones\r\nwhich vibrate in my heart where Satan knocks; and although I have a\r\nhorror of vile saturnalias, of which the mere shadow suffices to anger\r\nme, I listen in spite of myself to the infernal tones.... The phantom\r\nof crime across my reason prowls around (in my skull).... Murder, rape,\r\nrobbery, parricide, pass through my mind like fierce lightnings....’\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of death and corruption has a strong attraction for him.\r\nHe delights in putrefaction and revels in disease.\r\n\r\n‘My ghostly belovèd, snatched by death, played before me livid and\r\npurple.... Bony nakedness, chaste in her leanness! Hectic beauty as sad\r\nas it is ardent!... Near her a coffin ... greedily opened its oblong\r\njaws, and seemed to call her....’ (_L’Amante macabre_).\r\n\r\n  ‘Mademoiselle Squelette!\r\n  Je la surnommais ainsi:\r\n  Elle était si maigrelette!\r\n\r\n  ‘Crachant une gouttelette\r\n  De sang très peu cramoisi...\r\n  Elle était si maigrelette!...\r\n\r\n  ‘Sa phthisie étant complète;...\r\n  Sa figure verdelette...\r\n  Un soir, à l’espagnolette\r\n  Elle vint se pendre ici.\r\n\r\n  ‘Horreur! une cordelette\r\n  Décapitait sans merci\r\n  Mademoiselle Squelette:\r\n  Elle était si maigrelette!’\r\n\r\n  _Mademoiselle Squelette._\r\n\r\n‘That I might rescue the angelically beautiful dead from the horrible\r\nkisses of the worm I had her embalmed in a strange box. It was on a\r\nwinter’s night. From the ice-cold, stiff and livid body were taken out\r\nthe poor defunct organs, and into the open belly, bloody and empty,\r\nwere poured sweet-smelling salves....’ (_La Morte embaumée_).\r\n\r\n‘Flesh, eyebrows, hair, my coffin and my winding-sheet, the grave\r\nhas eaten them all; its work is done.... My skull has attested its\r\nshrinking, and I, a scaling, crumbling residue of death, have come to\r\nlook back with regret upon the time when I was rotting, and the worm\r\nyet fasted not....’ (_Le mauvais Mort_).\r\n\r\nThis depravity of taste will not seldom be observed among the deranged.\r\nIn Rollinat it merely inspires loathsome verses; among others it leads\r\nthem to the eager devouring of human excretions, and, in its worst\r\nforms, to being enamoured of a corpse (_Necrophilia_).\r\n\r\nViolent erotomaniacal excitement expresses itself in a series of\r\npoems (_Les Luxures_), which not only celebrate the most unbridled\r\nsensuality, but also all the aberrations of sexual psychopathy.\r\n\r\nBut the most conspicuous are the sensations of undefined horrors which\r\ncontinually beset him. Everything inspires him with anguish; all the\r\nsights of Nature appear to him to enclose some frightful mystery. He is\r\nalways expecting, in trembling, some unknown terror.\r\n\r\n‘I always shudder at the strange look of some boot and some shoe. Ay,\r\nyou may shrug your shoulders mockingly, I do shudder; and suddenly, on\r\nthinking of the foot they cover, I ask myself: “Is it mechanical, or\r\nliving?” ...’ (_Le Maniaque_).\r\n\r\n‘My room is like my soul.... Heavy curtains, very ancient, cling round\r\nthe deep bed; long fantastic insects dance and crawl on the ceiling.\r\nWhen my clock strikes the hour it makes an appalling noise; every swing\r\nof the pendulum vibrates, and is strangely prolonged.... Furniture,\r\npictures, flowers, even the books, all smell of hell and poison; and\r\nthe horror, which loves me, envelops this prison like a pall....’ (_La\r\nChambre_).\r\n\r\n‘The library made me think of very old forests; thirteen iron lamps,\r\noblong and spectral, poured their sepulchral light day and night on\r\nthe faded books full of shadow and secrets. I always shuddered when I\r\nentered. I felt myself in the midst of fogs and death-rattles, drawn\r\non by the arms of thirteen pale armchairs, and scanned by the eyes of\r\nthirteen great portraits....’ (_La Bibliothèque_).\r\n\r\n‘In the swamp full of malice, which clogs and penetrates his stockings,\r\nhe hears himself faintly called by several voices making but one. He\r\nfinds a corpse as sentinel, which rolls its dull eyeballs, and moves\r\nits corruption with an automatic spring. I show to his dismayed eyes\r\nfires in the deserted houses, and in the forsaken parks beds full\r\nof green rose.... And the old cross on the calvary hails him from\r\nafar, and curses him, crossing its stern arms as it stretches out and\r\nbrandishes them....’ (_La Peur_).\r\n\r\nI will not weary by multiplying examples, and will only quote the\r\ntitles of a few more poems: _The Living Grave_; _Troppmann’s Soliloquy_\r\n(a well-known eight-fold murderer); _The Crazy Hangman_; _The Monster_;\r\n_The Madman_; _The Headache_ (_La Céphalalgie_); _The Disease_; _The\r\nFrenzied Woman_; _Dead Eyes_; _The Abyss_; _Tears_; _Anguish_; _The\r\nSlow Death-struggle_; _The Interment_; _The Coffin_; _The Death-knell_;\r\n_Corruption_; _The Song of the Guillotined_, etc.\r\n\r\nAll these poems are the production of a craze, which will be frequently\r\nobserved among degenerates. Even Dostojevski, who is known to have\r\nbeen mentally afflicted, suffered from it also. ‘As soon as it grew\r\ndusk,’ he relates of himself,[220] ‘I gradually fell into that state\r\nof mind which so often overmasters me at night since I have been ill,\r\nand which I shall call mystic fright. It is a crushing anxiety about\r\nsomething which I can neither define nor even conceive, which does not\r\nactually exist, but which perhaps is about to be realized suddenly, at\r\nthis very moment, to appear and rise up before me like an inexorable,\r\nhorrible, unshapen fact.’ Legrain[221] quotes a degenerate lunatic\r\nwhose mania began ‘with feelings of fear and anguish at some fancy.’\r\nProfessor Kowalewski[222] indicates as degrees of mental derangement in\r\ndegeneration--first, neurasthenia; secondly, impulses of ‘obsession’\r\nand feelings of morbid anguish. Legrand du Saulle[223] and Morel[224]\r\ndescribe this state of groundless, undefined fear, and coin for it\r\nthe not very happy word ‘Panophobia.’ Magnan calls it more correctly\r\n‘Anxiomania’--frenzied anguish--and speaks of it as a very common\r\nstigma of degeneration. The anguish mania is an error of consciousness,\r\nwhich is filled with presentations of fear, and transfers their\r\ncause into the external world, while, as a matter of fact, they are\r\nstimulated by pathological processes within the organism. The invalid\r\nfeels oppressed and uneasy, and imputes to the phenomena which\r\nsurround him a threatening and sinister aspect, in order to explain\r\nto himself his dread, the origin of which escapes him, because it is\r\nrooted in the unconscious.\r\n\r\nAs in Rollinat we have learnt to know the poet of anxiomania, so shall\r\nwe find in another author, whose name has become widely known in the\r\nlast two years, in the Belgian, Maurice Maeterlinck, an example of\r\nan utterly childish idiotically-incoherent mysticism. He reveals the\r\nstate of his mind most characteristically in his poems,[225] of which I\r\nwill give a few examples. Here is the first of the collection--_Serres\r\nchaudes_:\r\n\r\n‘O hot-house in the middle of the woods. And your doors ever closed!\r\nAnd all that is under your dome! And under my soul in your analogies!\r\n\r\n‘The thoughts of a princess who is hungry; the tedium of a sailor in\r\nthe desert; a brass-band under the windows of incurables.\r\n\r\n‘Go into the warm moist corners! One might say, ‘tis a woman fainting\r\non harvest-day. In the courtyard of the infirmary are postilions; in\r\nthe distance an elk-hunter passes by, who now tends the sick.\r\n\r\n‘Examine in the moonlight! (Oh, nothing there is in its place!) One\r\nmight say, a madwoman before judges, a battle-ship in full sail on a\r\ncanal, night-birds on lilies, a death-knell towards noon (down there\r\nunder those bells), a halting-place for the sick in the meadows, a\r\nsmell of ether on a sunny day.\r\n\r\n‘My God! my God! when shall we have rain and snow and wind in the\r\nhot-house?’\r\n\r\nThese idiotic sequences of words are psychologically interesting,\r\nfor they demonstrate with instructive significance the workings of\r\na shattered brain. Consciousness no longer elaborates a leading or\r\ncentral idea. Representations emerge just as the wholly mechanical\r\nassociation of ideas arouses them. There is no attention seeking to\r\nbring order into the tumult of images as they come and go, to separate\r\nthe unconnected, to suppress those that contradict each other, and to\r\ngroup those which are allied into a single logical series.\r\n\r\nA few more examples of these fugitive thoughts exclusively under the\r\nrule of unbridled association. Here is one entitled _Bell-glasses_\r\n(_Cloches de verre_):\r\n\r\n‘O bell-glasses! Strange plants for ever under shelter! While the wind\r\nstirs my senses without! A whole valley of the soul for ever still! And\r\nthe enclosed lush warmth towards noon! And the pictures seen through\r\nthe glass!\r\n\r\n‘Never remove one of them! Several have been placed on old moonlight.\r\nLook through their foliage. There is perhaps a vagabond on a throne;\r\none has the impression that corsairs are waiting on the pond, and that\r\nantediluvian beings are about to invade the towns.\r\n\r\n‘Some have been placed on old snows. Some have been placed on ancient\r\nrains. (Pity the enclosed atmosphere!) I hear a festival solemnized on\r\na famine Sunday; there is an ambulance in the middle of the house, and\r\nall the daughters of the king wander on a fast-day across the meadows.\r\n\r\n‘Examine specially those of the horizon! They cover carefully very old\r\nthunderstorms. Oh, there must be somewhere an immense fleet on a marsh!\r\nAnd I believe that the swans have hatched ravens. (One can scarcely\r\ndistinguish through the dampness.)\r\n\r\n‘A maiden sprinkles the ferns with hot water; a troop of little girls\r\nwatch the hermit in his cell; my sisters have fallen asleep on the\r\nfloor of a poisonous grotto!\r\n\r\n‘Wait for the moon and the winter, among these bells, scattered at last\r\non the ice.’\r\n\r\nAnother called _Soul_ (_Ame_):\r\n\r\n‘My soul! O my soul truly too much sheltered! And these flocks of\r\ndesires in a hot-house! Awaiting a storm in the meadows! Let us go to\r\nthe most sickly: they have strange exhalations. In the midst of them I\r\ncross a battlefield with my mother. They are burying a brother-in-arms\r\nat noon, while the sentries take their repast.\r\n\r\n‘Let us go also to the weakest; they have strange sweats: here is a\r\nsick bride, treachery on Sunday, and little children in prison. (And\r\nfurther across the mist.) Is it a dying woman at the door of a kitchen?\r\nOr a nun, who cleans vegetables at the foot of the bed of an incurable?\r\n\r\n‘Let us go lastly to the saddest: (at the last because they have\r\npoisons). O my lips accept the kisses of one wounded!\r\n\r\n‘All the ladies of the castle are dead of hunger this summer in the\r\ntowers of my soul! Here is the dawn, which enters into the festival!\r\nI have a glimpse of sheep along the quays, and there is a sail at the\r\nwindows of the hospital!\r\n\r\n‘It is a long road from my heart to my soul! And all the sentries are\r\ndead at their posts!\r\n\r\n‘One day there was a poor little festival in the suburbs of my soul!\r\nThey mowed the hemlock there one Sunday morning; and all the convent\r\nvirgins saw the ships pass by on the canal one sunny fast-day. While\r\nthe swans suffered under a poisonous bridge. The trees were lopped\r\nabout the prison; medicines were brought one afternoon in June, and\r\nmeals for the patients were spread over the whole horizon!\r\n\r\n‘My soul! And the sadness of it all, my soul! and the sadness of it\r\nall!’\r\n\r\nI have translated with the greatest exactness, and not omitted one\r\nword of the three ‘poems.’ Nothing would be easier than to compose\r\nothers on these models, overtrumping even those of Maeterlinck--_e.g._,\r\n‘O Flowers! And we groan so heavily under the very old taxes! An\r\nhour-glass, at which the dog barks in May; and the strange envelope\r\nof the negro who has not slept. A grandmother who would eat oranges\r\nand could not write! Sailors in a ballroom, but blue! blue! On the\r\nbridge this crocodile and the policeman with the swollen cheek beckons\r\nsilently! O two soldiers in the cowhouse, and the razor is notched! But\r\nthe chief prize they have not drawn. And on the lamp are ink-spots!’\r\netc. But why parody Maeterlinck? His style bears no parody, for it has\r\nalready reached the extreme limits of idiocy. Nor is it quite worthy of\r\na mentally sound man to make fun of a poor devil of an idiot.\r\n\r\nCertain of his poems consist simply of assonances, linked together\r\nwithout regard to sense and meaning, _e.g._, one which is entitled\r\n_Ennui_:\r\n\r\n‘The careless peacocks, the white peacocks have flown, the white\r\npeacocks have flown from the tedium of awaking; I see the white\r\npeacocks, the peacocks of to-day, the peacocks that went away during my\r\nsleep, the careless peacocks, the peacocks of to-day, reach lazily the\r\npond where no sun is, I hear the white peacocks, the peacocks of ennui,\r\nwaiting lazily for the times when no sun is.’\r\n\r\nThe French original reveals why these words were chosen; they contain\r\nalmost all the nasal sounds, ‘en’ or ‘an’ or ‘aon’: ‘_Les paons\r\nnonchalants, les paons blancs ont fui, les paons blancs ont fui l’ennui\r\ndu réveil; je vois les paons blancs ... atteindre indolents l’étang\r\nsans soleil_,’ etc. This is a case of that form of echolalia which is\r\nobserved not seldom among the insane. One patient says, _e.g._, ‘_Man\r\nkann dann ran Mann wann Clan Bann Schwan Hahn_,’ and he continues to\r\ngrind similar sounds till he is either tired, or takes a word spoken\r\nbefore him as a starting-point for a new series of rhymes.\r\n\r\nIf Maeterlinck’s poems are read with some attention, it is soon seen\r\nthat the muddled pictures which follow each other pell-mell as in a\r\ndream, are borrowed from a very limited circle of ideas, which have\r\neither generally, or only for him, an emotional content. ‘Strange,’\r\n‘old,’ ‘distant,’ are the adjectives he constantly repeats; they have\r\nthis in common that they indicate something indistinct, not definitely\r\nrecognisable, away on the bounds of the distant horizon, corresponding,\r\ntherefore, to the nebulous thought of mysticism. Another adjective\r\nwhich sets him dreaming is ‘slow’ (_lent_). It also influences the\r\nFrench Symbolists, and hence their fondness for it. They evidently\r\nassociated it with the idea of the movements of the priest reading the\r\nMass, and it awakens in them the emotions of the mysticism of faith.\r\nThey betray this association of ideas by this, that they frequently\r\nuse _lent_ together with _hiératique_ (sacerdotal). Maeterlinck,\r\nmoreover, is constantly thinking of hospitals with their sick, and\r\nof everything connected with them (nuns, invalids’ diet, medicines,\r\nsurgical operations, bandages, etc.), of canals with ships and swans,\r\nand of princesses. The hospitals and the canals, which are a feature in\r\nthe Belgian landscape, may be connected with the first impressions of\r\nhis childhood, and therefore produce emotions in him. The princesses,\r\non the contrary, shut up in towers, suffering hunger, going astray,\r\nwading through swamps, etc., have evidently remained fixed in his\r\nimagination from the childish ballads of the pre-Raphaelites, one\r\nof which, by Swinburne, was given above as an example. Hospitals,\r\ncanals, princesses, these are the pictures which always recur with the\r\nobstinacy of obsessions, and in the midst of the nebulous chaos of his\r\njargon, alone show some sort of firm outline.\r\n\r\nA few of his poems are written in the traditional poetical form;\r\nothers, on the contrary, have neither measure nor rhyme, but consist\r\nof lines of prose, arbitrarily changing in length, not according to\r\nthe style of Goethe’s free poems, or of Heine’s _North Sea Songs_,\r\nwhich ripple by with very strongly marked rhythmic movement, but deaf,\r\njolting and limping, as the items of an inventory. These pieces are a\r\nservile imitation of the effusions of Walt Whitman, that crazy American\r\nto whom Maeterlinck was necessarily strongly attracted, according to\r\nthe law I have repeatedly set forth--that all deranged minds flock\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI should like here to interpolate a few remarks on Walt Whitman, who is\r\nlikewise one of the deities to whom the degenerate and hysterical of\r\nboth hemispheres have for some time been raising altars. Lombroso ranks\r\nhim expressly among ‘mad geniuses.’[226] Mad Whitman was without doubt.\r\nBut a genius? That would be difficult to prove. He was a vagabond,\r\na reprobate rake, and his poems[227] contain outbursts of erotomania\r\nso artlessly shameless that their parallel in literature could hardly\r\nbe found with the author’s name attached. For his fame he has to\r\nthank just those bestially sensual pieces which first drew to him the\r\nattention of all the pruriency of America. He is morally insane, and\r\nincapable of distinguishing between good and evil, virtue and crime.\r\n‘This is the deepest theory of susceptibility,’ he says in one place,\r\n‘without preference or exclusion; the negro with the woolly head, the\r\nbandit of the highroad, the invalid, the ignorant--none are denied.’\r\nAnd in another place he explains he ‘loves the murderer and the thief,\r\nthe pious and good, with equal love.’ An American driveller, W. D.\r\nO’Connor, has called him on this account ‘The good gray Poet.’ We know,\r\nhowever, that this ‘goodness,’ which is in reality moral obtuseness and\r\nmorbid sentimentality, frequently accompanies degeneration, and appears\r\neven in the cruellest assassins, for example, in Ravachol.\r\n\r\nHe has megalomania, and says of himself:\r\n\r\n‘From this hour I decree that my being be freed from all restraints and\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n‘I go where I will, my own absolute and complete master.\r\n\r\n‘I breathe deeply in space. The east and the west are mine.\r\n\r\n‘Mine are the north and south. I am greater and better than I thought\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n‘I did not know that so much boundless goodness was in me....\r\n\r\n‘Whoever disowns me causes me no annoyance.\r\n\r\n‘Whoever recognises me shall be blessed, and will bless me.’\r\n\r\nHe is mystically mad, and announces: ‘I have the feeling of all. I am\r\nall, and believe in all. I believe that materialism is true, and that\r\nspiritualism is also true; I reject nothing.’ And in another still more\r\ncharacteristic passage:\r\n\r\n ‘Santa Spirita [_sic!_], breather, life, Beyond the light, lighter\r\n than light, Beyond the flames of hell, joyous, leaping easily above\r\n hell, Beyond Paradise, perfumed solely with mine own perfume,\r\n Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including\r\n Saviour and Satan, Ethereal, pervading all, for without me what were\r\n all? what were God? Essence of forms, life of the real identities ...\r\n Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, I, the\r\n general soul.’\r\n\r\nIn his patriotic poems he is a sycophant of the corrupt American\r\nvote-buying, official-bribing, power-abusing, dollar-democracy, and a\r\ncringer to the most arrogant Yankee conceit. His war-poems--the much\r\nrenowned _Drum Taps_--are chiefly remarkable for swaggering bombast and\r\nstilted patter.\r\n\r\nHis purely lyrical pieces, with their ecstatic ‘Oh!’ and ‘Ah!’ with\r\ntheir soft phrases about flowers, meadows, spring and sunshine, recall\r\nthe most arid, sugary and effeminate passages of our old Gessner, now\r\nhappily buried and forgotten.\r\n\r\nAs a man, Walt Whitman offers a surprising resemblance to Paul\r\nVerlaine, with whom he shared all the stigmata of degeneration, the\r\nvicissitudes of his career, and, curiously enough, even the rheumatic\r\nankylosis. As a poet, he has thrown off the closed strophe as too\r\ndifficult, measure and rhyme as too oppressive, and has given vent to\r\nhis emotional fugitive ideation in hysterical exclamations, to which\r\nthe definition of ‘prose gone mad’ is infinitely better suited than\r\nit is to the pedantic, honest hexameters of Klopstock. Unconsciously,\r\nhe seemed to have used the parallelism of the Psalms, and Jeremiah’s\r\neruptive style, as models of form. We had in the last century the\r\n_Paramythien_ of Herder, and the insufferable ‘poetical prose’ of\r\nGessner already mentioned. Our healthy taste soon led us to recognise\r\nthe inartistic, retrogressive character of this lack of form, and\r\nthat error in taste has found no imitator among us for a century. In\r\nWhitman, however, his hysterical admirers commend this _réchauffé_ of\r\na superannuated literary fashion as something to come; and admire,\r\nas an invention of genius, what is only an incapacity for methodical\r\nwork. Nevertheless, it is interesting to point out that two persons\r\nso dissimilar as Richard Wagner and Walt Whitman have, in different\r\nspheres, under the pressure of the same motives, arrived at the same\r\ngoal--the former at ‘infinite melody,’ which is no longer melody; the\r\nlatter at verses which are no longer verses, both in consequence of\r\ntheir incapacity to submit their capriciously vacillating thoughts to\r\nthe yoke of those rules which in ‘infinite’ melody, as in lyric verse,\r\ngovern by measure and rhyme.\r\n\r\nMaeterlinck, then, in his poems is a servile imitator of crazy Walt\r\nWhitman, and carries his absurdities still further. Besides his poems\r\nhe has written things to which one cannot well refuse the name of\r\nplays, since they are cast in the form of dialogues. The best known of\r\nthem is _The Princess Maleine_.[228]\r\n\r\nThe ‘dramatis personæ,’ as he, true to the romantic and mystical\r\npractice of the pre-Raphaelites and Symbolists, entitles the list of\r\nhis characters, are as follows: Hjalmar, King of one part of Holland;\r\nMarcellus, King of another part of Holland; Prince Hjalmar, son of\r\nKing Hjalmar; little Allan, son of Queen Anne; Angus, friend to Prince\r\nHjalmar; Stephano and Vanox, officers of Marcellus; Anne, Queen of\r\nJütland; Godeliva, wife of King Marcellus; Princess Maleine, daughter\r\nof Marcellus and Godeliva; Maleine’s nurse; Princess Uglyane, daughter\r\nof Queen Anne. With them come all the old well-known jointed dolls\r\nand puppets out of the dustiest corners of the old lumber-rooms of\r\nromance--a fool, three poor people, two old peasants, courtiers,\r\npilgrims, a cripple, beggars, vagabonds, an old woman, seven (the\r\nmystic number!) nuns, etc.\r\n\r\nThe names which Maeterlinck gives to his figures should be noted.\r\nAs a Fleming, he knows very well that Hjalmar is not Dutch, but\r\nScandinavian; that Angus is Scotch. But he makes this confusion\r\nintentionally, in order to obliterate the distinct outlines with which\r\nhe appears to surround his figures, when he calls them ‘Kings of\r\nHolland’; in order again to detach them from the firm ground on which\r\nhe pretends to place them and to suppress their co-ordinates, which\r\nassign them a place in space and time. They may wear clothes, have\r\nnames and take a human rank, but all the while they are only shadows\r\nand clouds.\r\n\r\nKing Hjalmar comes with Prince Hjalmar to the castle of Marcellus in\r\norder to ask for the hand of the Princess Maleine. The two young people\r\nsee each other for the first time, and only for a few minutes, but they\r\ninstantly fall in love with each other. At the banquet in honour of the\r\nKing a quarrel breaks out, about which we learn no particulars; King\r\nHjalmar is seriously offended, swears revenge, and leaves the castle\r\nin a rage. In the interlude Hjalmar wages war against Marcellus, kills\r\nhim and his wife, Godeliva, and at once razes his castle and town to\r\nthe ground. Princess Maleine and her nurse were on this occasion--how,\r\nwhy and by whom is not explained--immured in a vaulted room in a tower;\r\nthen the nurse, after three days’ work with her finger-nails, loosens a\r\nstone in the wall, and the two women obtain their liberty.\r\n\r\nSince Maleine loves Hjalmar and cannot forget him, they make their way\r\ntowards his father’s castle. Things are going very badly in Hjalmar’s\r\ncastle. There Queen Anne of Jütland resides, who has been driven away\r\nby her subjects, and with her grown-up daughter Uglyane and her little\r\nson Allan (here also the Dane is systematically given a Scottish name),\r\nhas found hospitality with King Hjalmar. Queen Anne has turned the head\r\nof the old man. She has become his mistress, rules him completely, and\r\nmakes him ill in body and soul. She wishes that his son should marry\r\nher daughter. Hjalmar is in despair about his father’s collapse. He\r\ndetests his morganatic step-mother, and shudders at the thought of a\r\nmarriage with Uglyane. He believes Maleine to have been slain with her\r\nparents in the war, but he cannot yet forget her.\r\n\r\nMaleine has in the meantime been wandering with her nurse through a\r\nkind of enchanted forest, and through an incomprehensible village,\r\nwhere she has uncanny meetings with all sorts of people, beggars,\r\nvagabonds, peasants, old women, etc., interchanging odd talk, and\r\nreaches Hjalmar’s castle, where no one knows her. She is, however, in\r\nspite of this, at once appointed as lady-in-waiting to the Princess\r\nUglyane.\r\n\r\nOne evening Prince Hjalmar decides to make advances to Uglyane, and\r\nwith that object he gives her a nocturnal rendezvous in the park of the\r\ncastle, not a secret, but, so to speak, an official, lovers’ tryst, to\r\nwhich he, with his father’s consent, and she, with her mother’s, is to\r\ngo. Maleine hinders it by telling Uglyane, who is splendidly attiring\r\nand adorning herself, that Prince Hjalmar has gone into the forest\r\nand will not come. She then goes herself into the park, and makes\r\nherself known to Hjalmar, who arrives punctually. He leads her in great\r\ndelight to his father, who receives her as his future daughter-in-law,\r\nand there is no further talk of his betrothal to Uglyane. Queen Anne\r\ndetermines to get rid of the intruder. She behaves at first in a\r\nfriendly manner, assigns her a beautiful room in the castle, then\r\nin the night she forces the King, who for a long time resists her,\r\nto penetrate into Maleine’s room, where she puts a cord round the\r\nPrincess’s neck and strangles her. Signs and wonders accompany the\r\ndeed: a tempest forces open a window, a comet appears, a wing of the\r\ncastle falls in ruins, a forest bursts into flames, swans fall wounded\r\nout of the air, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nNext morning the body of the Princess Maleine is discovered. King\r\nHjalmar, whom the night’s murder has robbed of the last remnant of\r\nreason, betrays the secret of the deed. Prince Hjalmar stabs Queen\r\nAnne, and then plunges the dagger into his own heart. Thereupon the\r\npiece closes thus:\r\n\r\n NURSE. Come away, my poor lord.\r\n\r\n KING. Good God! good God! She is waiting now on the wharf of hell!\r\n\r\n NURSE. Come away! come away!\r\n\r\n KING. Is there anybody here that fears the curses of the dead?\r\n\r\n ANGUS. Ay, my lord, I do.\r\n\r\n KING. Well, you close their eyes, and let us be gone.\r\n\r\n NURSE. Ay, ay. Come hence! come hence!\r\n\r\n KING. I will; I will. Oh, oh! how lonely I shall feel hereafter! I am\r\n steeped in misery up to my ears at seventy-seven years of age. But\r\n where are you?\r\n\r\n NURSE! Here, here!\r\n\r\n KING. You will not feel angry with me? Let us go to breakfast. Will\r\n there be salad for breakfast? I should like a little salad.\r\n\r\n NURSE. Yes, yes. You shall have some, my lord.\r\n\r\n KING. I do not know why; I feel somewhat melancholy to-day. Good God!\r\n good God! How unhappy the dead do look! [_Exit with_ NURSE.\r\n\r\n ANGUS. Another night such as this, and all our heads will have turned\r\n white.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all save the_ NUNS, _who begin singing the Miserere while\r\n conveying the corpses towards the bed. The church bells cease\r\n sounding. Nightingales are heard warbling without. A cock jumps on the\r\n window-sill, and crows._\r\n\r\nWhen we begin to read this piece we are startled, and ask: ‘Why is all\r\nthis so familiar to me? Of what does it remind me?’ After a few pages\r\nit all at once becomes clear: the whole thing is a kind of cento from\r\nShakespeare! Every character, every scene, every speech in any way\r\nessential to the piece! King Hjalmar is put together out of King Lear\r\nand Macbeth; Lear in his madness and manner of expressing himself,\r\nMacbeth in his share in the murder of the Princess Maleine. Queen\r\nAnne is patched up out of Lady Macbeth and Queen Gertrude; Prince\r\nHjalmar is unmistakably Hamlet, with his obscure speeches, his profound\r\nallusions and his inner struggles between filial duty and morality; the\r\nnurse is from Romeo and Juliet; Angus is Horatio; Vanox and Stephano\r\nare Rosenkranz and Guildenstern, with an admixture of Marcellus and\r\nBernardo, and all the subordinate characters, the fool, the doctor, the\r\ncourtiers, etc., bear the physiognomy of Shakespeare’s characters.\r\n\r\nThe piece begins in the following manner:\r\n\r\n _The Gardens of the Castle._\r\n\r\n _Enter_ STEPHANO _and_ VANOX.\r\n\r\n VANOX. What o’clock is it?\r\n\r\n STEPHANO. Judging from the moon, it should be midnight.\r\n\r\n VANOX. I think ‘tis going to rain.\r\n\r\nLet us compare this with the first scene in _Hamlet_:\r\n\r\n _A platform before the Castle._\r\n\r\n FRANCISCO ... BERNARDO.\r\n\r\n FRANCISCO. You come most carefully upon your hour.\r\n\r\n BERNARDO. ‘Tis now struck twelve....\r\n\r\n FRANCISCO. ... ‘Tis bitter cold, and I am sick at heart, etc.\r\n\r\nOne could, if it were worth while, trace scene for scene, word for\r\nword, from some passage in Shakespeare. In the _Princesse Maleine_\r\nwe find in succession the fearfully stormy night from _Julius Cæsar_\r\n(Act I., Scene 3); the entrance of King Lear into the palace of Albany\r\n(Act I., Scene 4 ... ‘LEAR: Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go, get\r\nit ready,’ etc.); the night scene in _Macbeth_, where Lady Macbeth\r\ninduces her husband to commit murder; the thrice-repeated ‘Oh! oh!\r\noh!’ of Othello which Queen Anne here utters; Hamlet’s conversation\r\nwith Horatio, etc. The death of the Princess Maleine has been inspired\r\nby memories both of Desdemona suffocated and of Cordelia hanged. All\r\nthis is jumbled up in the craziest manner, and often distorted almost\r\nbeyond recognition, or given the opposite meaning; but, with a little\r\nattention, one can always find one’s way.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a child, at the age when he is able to follow the\r\nconversation of grown-up people, attending a performance or a reading\r\nof _Hamlet_, _Lear_, _Macbeth_, _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Richard II._,\r\nand who on his return to the nursery should relate in his own way to\r\nhis little brothers and sisters what he had heard. We should in this\r\nway get a correct idea of the composition of _Princesse Maleine_.\r\nMaeterlinck has crammed himself with Shakespeare, and reproduces the\r\npieces undigested, yet repulsively altered and with the beginnings of\r\nfoul decomposition. This is an unappetizing picture, but it alone can\r\nserve to illustrate the mental process which goes on in the so-called\r\n‘creations’ of the degenerate. They read greedily, receive a very\r\nstrong impression in consequence of their emotionalism; this pursues\r\nthem with the force of an ‘obsession,’ and they do not rest till they\r\nhave reproduced, sadly travestied, what they have read. Thus their\r\nworks resemble the coins of the barbarians, which are imitations of\r\nRoman and Greek models, while betraying that their artificers could not\r\nread or understand the letters and symbols inscribed on them.\r\n\r\nMaeterlinck’s _Princesse Maleine_ is a Shakespearian anthology for\r\nchildren or Tierra del Fuegians. The characters of the British poet\r\nhave gone to make parts for the actors in a theatre of monkeys.\r\nThey still remind us more or less of the attitudes and movements of\r\nthe persons whom they ape, but they have not a human brain in their\r\nheads, and cannot say two connected and rational words. Here are a few\r\nexamples of the manner in which Maeterlinck’s people converse:\r\n\r\nKing Marcellus in the First Act (Scene 2) endeavours to dissuade the\r\nPrincess Maleine from loving Hjalmar.\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Well, Maleine!\r\n\r\n MALEINE. My lord?\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Do you not understand?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. What, my lord?\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Will you promise me to forget Hjalmar?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. My lord!...\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. What say you? Do you still love Hjalmar?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. Ay, my lord.\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Ay, my lord. Oh, devils and tempests! she coolly confesses\r\n it. She dares to tell me this without shame. She has seen Hjalmar once\r\n only, for one single afternoon, and now she is hotter than hell.\r\n\r\n GODELIVA. My lord!...\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Be silent, you. “Ay, my lord!” and she is not yet fifteen!\r\n Ha! it makes one long to kill them then and there....\r\n\r\n GODELIVA. My lord....\r\n\r\n NURSE. Isn’t she free to love, just like anyone else? Do you mean to\r\n put her under a glass case? Is this a reason to bully a poor child?\r\n She has done no harm....\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Oh, she has done no harm!... Now, in the first place, hold\r\n your peace, you.... I am not addressing you; and it is doubtless at\r\n your prompting, you procuress....\r\n\r\n GODELIVA. My lord!...\r\n\r\n NURSE. A procuress! I a procuress!\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Will you let me speak? Begone! begone, both of you! Oh!\r\n I know well enough you have put your heads together, and that the\r\n season of scheming and plotting has set in; but wait awhile....\r\n Now, Maleine, ... you should be reasonable. Will you promise to be\r\n reasonable?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. Ay, my lord.\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. There! come now. Therefore you will not think any more of\r\n this marriage?...\r\n\r\n MALEINE. Ay.\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Ay? You mean you will forget Prince Hjalmar?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. No.\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. You do not yet give up Prince Hjalmar?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. No.\r\n\r\n MARCELLUS. Now, supposing I compel you? Ay, I! and supposing I\r\n have you put under lock and key? and supposing I separate you for\r\n evermore from your Hjalmar with his puny, girlish face? What say you?\r\n (_She weeps._) Ha! that’s it--is’t? Begone, and we shall see about\r\n that--begone!\r\n\r\nNext, the scene in the second act, where Maleine and Hjalmar meet in\r\nthe gloomy park of the castle:\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. ... Come!\r\n\r\n MALEINE. Not yet.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Uglyane! Uglyane!\r\n\r\n [_Kisses her. Here the waterfall, blown about by the wind, collapses\r\n and splashes them._\r\n\r\nMALEINE. Oh! what have you done?\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. It is the fountain.\r\n\r\nMALEINE. Oh, oh!\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. It’s the wind.\r\n\r\nMALEINE. I am afraid.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Think not of that any longer. Let us get further away. Let us\r\nnot think of that any more. Ah, ah, ah! I am wet all over.\r\n\r\nMALEINE. There is somebody weeping, close by us.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Somebody weeping?\r\n\r\nMALEINE. I am afraid.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. But cannot you hear that it’s only the wind?\r\n\r\nMALEINE. What are all those eyes on the tree, though?\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Where? Ha! those are the owls. They have returned. I will put\r\nthem to flight. (_Throws earth at them._) Away! away!\r\n\r\nMALEINE. There is yonder one that will not go.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Where is it?\r\n\r\nMALEINE. On the weeping willow.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Away!\r\n\r\nMALEINE. He is not gone.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Away, away!\r\n\r\n [_Throws earth at the owl._\r\n\r\nMALEINE. Oh! you have thrown earth on me.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Thrown earth on you?\r\n\r\nMALEINE. Ay, it fell on me.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Oh, my poor Uglyane!\r\n\r\nMALEINE. I am afraid.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. Afraid--at my side?\r\n\r\nMALEINE. There are flames amid the trees.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. That is nothing--mere lightning. It has been very sultry\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nMALEINE. I am afraid. Oh! who can be digging so at the ground around us?\r\n\r\nHJALMAR. That is nothing. ‘Tis but a mole--a poor little mole at work.\r\n\r\n(The mole in Hamlet! To our old acquaintance greeting!)\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I am afraid.\r\n\r\nAfter some more conversation in the same style:\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. What are you thinking of?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I feel sad.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Sad? Now, what are your sad thoughts about, Uglyane?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I am thinking of Princess Maleine.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. What do you say?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I am thinking of Princess Maleine.[229]\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Do you know Princess Maleine?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I am Princess Maleine.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. You are not Uglyane?\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I am Princess Maleine.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. What! you Princess Maleine? Dead! But Princess Maleine is\r\n dead!\r\n\r\n MALEINE. I am Princess Maleine.\r\n\r\nHas anyone anywhere in the poetry of the two worlds ever seen such\r\ncomplete idiocy? These ‘Ahs’ and ‘Ohs,’ this want of comprehension of\r\nthe simplest remarks, this repetition four or five times of the same\r\nimbecile expressions, gives the truest conceivable clinical picture of\r\nincurable cretinism. These parts are precisely those most extolled by\r\nMaeterlinck’s admirers. According to them, all has been chosen with a\r\ndeep artistic intention. A healthy reader will scarcely swallow that.\r\nMaeterlinck’s puppets say nothing, because they have nothing to say.\r\nTheir author has not been able to put a single thought into their\r\nhollow skulls, because he himself possesses none. The creatures moving\r\non his stage are not thinking and speaking human beings, but tadpoles\r\nor slugs, considerably more stupid than trained fleas at a fair.\r\n\r\nMoreover, _Princesse Maleine_ is not altogether a Shakespearian dream.\r\nThe ‘seven nuns,’ _e.g._, belong to Maeterlinck. They are an astounding\r\ninvention. They are ever marching like demented geese through the\r\npiece, winding in and out, with their psalm-singing, through all the\r\nrooms and corridors of the King’s castle, through the court, through\r\nthe park, through the forest, coming unexpectedly round a corner in\r\nthe middle of a scene, trotting across the stage and off at the other\r\nside without anyone understanding whence they come, whither they go,\r\nor for what purpose they are brought on at all. They are a living\r\n‘obsession,’ mixing itself irresistibly in all the incidents of the\r\npiece. Here also we find all the intellectual fads which we noticed in\r\nthe _Serres Chaudes_. The Princess Maleine is herself the embodiment\r\nof the hungry, sick, strayed princesses, wandering over the meadows,\r\nwho haunt these poems, and undoubtedly sprang from Swinburne’s ballad\r\nof _The King’s Daughters_. The canals also play their part (p. 18).\r\n‘And the expression of her eyes! It seemed as though one were all of a\r\nsudden in a great stream [Fr. _canal_] of fresh water....’ (p. 110).\r\n‘We have been to look at the windmills along the canal,’ etc. And sick\r\npeople and illness are mentioned on almost every page (p. 110):\r\n\r\n ANNE. I was fever-stricken myself.\r\n\r\n THE KING. Everyone is fever-stricken on arriving here.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. There is much fever in the village, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides _Princesse Maleine_, Maeterlinck has written some other\r\npieces. One, _L’Intruse_ (The Intruder), deals with the idea that in a\r\nhouse where a sick person lies _in extremis_, Death intrudes towards\r\nmidnight, that he walks audibly through the garden, makes at first a\r\nfew trial strokes with his scythe on the grass before the castle, then\r\nknocks at the door, forces it open because they will not admit him,\r\nand carries off his victim. In a second, _Les Aveugles_ (The Blind),\r\nwe are shown how a number of blind men, the inmates of a blind asylum,\r\nwere led by an old priest into a forest, how the priest died suddenly\r\nwithout a sound, how the blind men did not at first notice this, but\r\nbecoming at length uneasy, groped about, succeeded in touching the\r\ncorpse, already growing cold, assured themselves by questioning each\r\nother that their leader was dead, and then in terrible despair awaited\r\ndeath by hunger and cold. For this charming story takes place on a wild\r\nisland in the far north; and between the wood and the asylum lies a\r\nriver, crossed by only one bridge, which the blind cannot find without\r\na guide. It never occurs either to Maeterlinck or to his inconsolable\r\nblind men as possible that in the asylum, where, as is expressly\r\nmentioned, there are attendant nuns, the long absence of the whole body\r\nof blind men would be noticed, and someone sent out to look for them.\r\nThe reader will not expect me to point out in detail the craziness of\r\nthe assumption in both these pieces, or that, after these examples, I\r\nshould relate and analyze two other pieces of Maeterlinck’s, _Les Sept\r\nPrincesses_ (‘seven,’ of course!) and _Pelléas et Mélisande_.\r\n\r\n_The Intruder_ has been translated into several languages, and\r\nperformed in many towns. The Viennese laughed at its imbecility. In\r\nParis and London men shook their heads. In Copenhagen an audience of\r\nappreciators of the ‘poetry of the future’ was touched, enraptured and\r\ninspired. This demonstrates the hysteria of to-day quite as much as the\r\npiece itself.\r\n\r\nThe history of Maeterlinck’s celebrity is especially remarkable and\r\ninstructive. This pitiable mental cripple vegetated for years wholly\r\nunnoticed in his corner in Ghent, without the Belgian Symbolists, who\r\noutbid even the French, according him the smallest attention; as to\r\nthe public at large, no one had a suspicion of his existence. Then one\r\nfine day in 1890 his writings fell accidentally into the hands of the\r\nFrench novelist, Octave Mirbeau. He read them, and whether he desired\r\nto make fun of his contemporaries in grand style, or whether he obeyed\r\nsome morbid ‘impulsion’ is not known; it is sufficient to say that he\r\npublished in _Le Figaro_ an article of an unheard-of extravagance,\r\nin which he represented Maeterlinck as the most brilliant, sublime,\r\nmoving poet which the last three hundred years had produced, and\r\nassigned him a place near--nay, above Shakespeare. And then the world\r\nwitnessed one of the most extraordinary and most convincing examples\r\nof the force of suggestion. The hundred thousand rich and cultivated\r\nreaders to whom the _Figaro_ addresses itself immediately took up the\r\nviews which Mirbeau had imperiously suggested to them. They at once saw\r\nMaeterlinck with Mirbeau’s eyes. They found in him all the beauties\r\nwhich Mirbeau asserted that he perceived in him. Andersen’s fairy-tale\r\nof the invisible clothes of the emperor repeated itself line for line.\r\nThey were not there, but the whole court saw them. Some imagined they\r\nreally saw the absent state robes; the others did not see them, but\r\nrubbed their eyes so long that they at least doubted whether they saw\r\nthem or not; others, again, could not impose upon themselves, but dared\r\nnot contradict the rest. Thus Maeterlinck became at one stroke, by\r\nMirbeau’s favour, a great poet, and a poet of the ‘future.’ Mirbeau had\r\nalso given quotations which would have completely sufficed for a reader\r\nwho was not hysterical, not given over irresistibly to suggestion, to\r\nrecognise Maeterlinck for what he is, namely, a mentally debilitated\r\nplagiarist; but these very quotations wrung cries of admiration from\r\nthe _Figaro_ public, for Mirbeau had pointed them out as beauties\r\nof the highest rank, and one knows that a decided affirmation is\r\nsufficient to compel hypnotic subjects to eat raw potatoes as oranges,\r\nand to believe themselves to be dogs or other quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nEverywhere apostles were quickly at hand to proclaim, interpret and\r\nextol the new master. The ‘mashers’ of the critic world, whose ambition\r\nis set on being the first to assume--nay, where it is possible, to\r\nforetell--the very latest fashions, the fashion of to-morrow, as much\r\nin the styles of literature, as in the colour and shape of neckties,\r\nvied with each other in deifying Maeterlinck. Ten editions of his\r\n_Princesse Maleine_ have been sold out since Mirbeau’s suggestion, and,\r\nas I have said before, his _Aveugles_ and _Intruse_ have been performed\r\nin various places.\r\n\r\nWe now know the different forms under which the mysticism of\r\ndegeneration manifests itself in contemporary literature. The magism of\r\na Guaita and a Papus, the Androgyne of a Péladan, the anxiomania of a\r\nRollinat, the idiotic drivelling of a Maeterlinck, may be regarded as\r\nits culminating aberrations. At least I cannot myself imagine that it\r\nwould be possible for mysticism to go beyond, even by the thickness of\r\na hair, these extreme points without even the hysterical, the devotees\r\nand the snobs of fashion, who are still in some degree capable of\r\ndiscernment, recognising in it a profound and complete intellectual\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n_EGO-MANIA._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF EGO-MANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWEVER dissimilar such individualities as Wagner and Tolstoi, Rossetti\r\nand Verlaine, may at first sight appear, we have, nevertheless,\r\nencountered in all of them certain common traits, to wit, vague and\r\nincoherent thought, the tyranny of the association of ideas, the\r\npresence of obsessions, erotic excitability, religious enthusiasm, by\r\nwhich we may recognise them as members of one and the same intellectual\r\nfamily, and justify their union into one single group--that of mystics.\r\n\r\nWe must go a step farther and say that not only the mystics among the\r\ndegenerate, but in the main all the degenerate, of whatever nature they\r\nmay be, are moulded from the same clay. They all show the same lacunæ,\r\ninequalities, and malformations in intellectual capacity, the same\r\npsychic and somatic stigmata. If, then, anyone, having a certain number\r\nof degenerate subjects to judge from, were to bring into prominence\r\nand represent as their exclusive peculiarity merely mystical thought\r\nin some, merely erotic emotionalism in others, merely vague, barren,\r\nfraternal love and a mania for regenerating the world, or else merely\r\nan impulsion to commit acts of a criminal nature, etc., he would\r\nmanifestly be seeing only one side of the phenomenon, and taking no\r\naccount of the rest. One or another stigma of degeneration may, in a\r\ngiven case, be especially apparent; but, on duly careful inspection,\r\nthe presence of all the others, or, at least, indications of them, will\r\nbe discerned.\r\n\r\nTo the celebrated French alienist, Esquirol, is due the signal merit\r\nof having discovered that there are forms of mental derangement in\r\nwhich thought proceeds apparently in a perfectly rational manner,\r\nbut in which, in the midst of intelligent and logical cerebral\r\nactivity, some insane presentations appear, like erratic boulders,\r\nthus enabling us to recognise the subject as mentally diseased. But\r\nEsquirol has committed the fault of not digging deep enough; his\r\nobservation is too much on the surface. It was through this that he\r\ncame to introduce into science the notion of ‘monomania,’ that is, of\r\nwell-delimitated, partial madness, of an isolated, fixed idea beside\r\nwhich all the rest of the intellectual life operates with sanity.\r\nThis was an error. There is no monomania. Esquirol’s own pupil, the\r\nelder Falret, has sufficiently proved it, and our Westphal, from whose\r\nother merits I have no wish to detract, was far from standing in\r\nthe forefront of research, when, half a century after Esquirol, and\r\nthirty years after Falret, he still described the ‘fear of space,’ or\r\nagoraphobia, as a special mental malady, or kind of monomania. What\r\nis apparently monomania is in reality an indication of a profound\r\norganic disorder which never reveals itself by one single phase of\r\nfolly. A fixed idea never exists in isolation.[230] It is always\r\naccompanied by other irregularities of thought and feeling, which, it\r\nis true, at a cursory glance, may not be so distinctly remarked as\r\nthe more strongly developed insane idea. Recent clinical observation\r\nhas discovered a long series of similar fixed ideas or ‘monomanias,’\r\nand recognised the fact that they are one and all the consequence of\r\na fundamental disposition of the organism, viz., of its degeneration.\r\nIt was unnecessary for Magnan to give a special name to each symptom\r\nof degeneration, and to draw up in array, with almost comical effect,\r\nthe host of ‘phobias’ and ‘manias.’ Agoraphobia (fear of open space),\r\nclaustrophobia (fear of enclosed space), rupophobia (fear of dirt),\r\niophobia (fear of poison), nosophobia (fear of sickness), aichmophobia\r\n(fear of pointed objects), belenophobia (fear of needles), cremnophobia\r\n(fear of abysses), trichophobia (fear of hair), onomatomania (folly of\r\nwords or names), pyromania (incendiary madness), kleptomania (madness\r\nfor theft), dipsomania (madness for drink), erotomania (love madness),\r\narithmomania (madness of numbers), oniomania (madness for buying), etc.\r\nThis list might be lengthened at pleasure, and enriched by nearly all\r\nthe roots of the Greek dictionary. It is simply philologico-medical\r\ntrifling. None of the disorders discovered and described by Magnan\r\nand his pupils, and decorated with a sonorous Greek name, forms an\r\nindependent entity, and appears separately; and Morel is right in\r\ndisregarding as unessential all these varied manifestations of a\r\nmorbid cerebral activity, and adhering to the principal phenomenon\r\nwhich lies at the base of all the ‘phobias’ and ‘manias,’ namely,\r\nthe great emotionalism of the degenerate.[231] If to emotionalism, or\r\nan excessive excitability, he had added the cerebral debility, which\r\nimplies feebleness of perception, will, memory, judgment, as well as\r\ninattention and instability, he would have exhaustively characterized\r\nthe nature of degeneration, and perhaps prevented psychiatry from being\r\nstuffed with a crowd of useless and disturbing designations. Kowalewski\r\napproached much nearer to the truth in his well-known treatise,[232]\r\nwhere he has represented all the mental disorders of the degenerate\r\nas one single malady, which merely presents different degrees of\r\nintensity, and which induces in its mildest form neurasthenia; under\r\na graver aspect impulsions and groundless anxieties; and, in its most\r\nserious form, the madness of brooding thought or doubt. Within these\r\nlimits may be ranged all the particular ‘manias’ and ‘phobias’ which at\r\npresent swarm in the literature of mental therapeutics.\r\n\r\nBut if it be untenable to make a particular malady out of every symptom\r\nin which the fundamental disorder (_i.e._, degeneration) shows itself,\r\nit should not, on the other hand, be ignored that among certain of the\r\ndegenerate a group of morbid phenomena distinctly predominates, without\r\ninvolving the absence of the other groups. Thus, it is permissible to\r\ndistinguish among them certain principal species, notably, beside the\r\nmystics, of whom we have studied the most remarkable representatives in\r\ncontemporary art and poetry, the ego-maniacs (_Ichsüchtigen_). It is\r\nnot from affectation that I use this word instead of the terms ‘egoism’\r\n(_Selbstsucht_) and ‘egoist,’ so generally employed. Egoism is a lack\r\nof amiability, a defect in education, perhaps a fault of character, a\r\nproof of insufficiently developed morality, but it is not a disease.\r\nThe egoist is quite able to look after himself in life, and hold his\r\nplace in society; he is often also, when the attainment of low ends\r\nonly is in view, even more capable than the superior and nobler man,\r\nwho has inured himself to self-abnegation. The ego-maniac, on the\r\ncontrary, is an invalid who does not see things as they are, does not\r\nunderstand the world, and cannot take up a right attitude towards it.\r\nThe difference I make in German between _Ichsucht_ and _Selbstsucht_,\r\nthe French also make in their language, where a careful writer will\r\nnever confound the word ‘egotisme,’ borrowed from the English, with\r\n‘egoïsme’--that is, selfishness.\r\n\r\nOf course the reader to whom the mental physiognomy of ego-maniacs is\r\nshown ought always to remember that, if the principal representatives\r\nof this species and of that of the mystics are characterized with\r\nsufficient clearness, the confines of the latter type are fluctuating.\r\nThe ego-maniacs are, on the one hand, at once mystics, erotics, and,\r\nthough it seems paradoxical, even affect occasionally an appearance of\r\nphilanthropy; among the mystics, on the other hand, we frequently meet\r\nwith a strongly-developed ego-mania. There are certain specimens among\r\nthe degenerate in whom all the disorders are produced to such an equal\r\ndegree that it is doubtful whether they ought to be classed with the\r\nmystics or the ego-maniacs. As a general rule, however, co-ordination\r\nunder one class or the other will not be very difficult.\r\n\r\nThat egoism is a salient feature in the character of the degenerate\r\nhas been unanimously confirmed by all observers. ‘The degenerate\r\nneither knows nor takes interest in anything but himself,’ says\r\nRoubinovitch;[233] and Legrain[234] asserts that he ‘has ... only\r\none occupation, that of satisfying his appetites.’ This peculiarity\r\nestablishes a bond which unites the highest of the degenerate to the\r\nlowest, the insane genius to the feeble mental cripple. ‘All delirious\r\ngeniuses,’ remarks Lombroso, ‘are very much captivated by, and\r\npreoccupied with, their own selves,’[235] and Sollier writes on the\r\nsubject of their antipodes, the imbeciles: ‘Undisciplined as they are,\r\nthey obey only through fear, are often violent, especially to those\r\nwho are weaker than themselves, humble and submissive towards those\r\nthey feel to be stronger. They are without affection, egoistic in the\r\nhighest degree, braggarts.’[236]\r\n\r\nThe clinicist is satisfied with indicating the fact of this\r\ncharacteristic egoism, but for ourselves we wish further to investigate\r\nwhat are its organic roots, why the degenerate must be more than\r\negoistic, why he must be an ego-maniac, and cannot be otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the consciousness of the ‘I’ (morbidly\r\nexaggerated and frequently increasing to megalomania) originates, we\r\nmust recall how the healthy consciousness of the ‘I’ is formed.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not my intention here to treat of the whole theory of\r\ncognition. It is only the most important results of this science, so\r\nhighly developed in the present day, that can find place in this work.\r\n\r\nIt has become a philosophical commonplace that we know directly only\r\nthose changes which take place in our own organism. If, in spite of\r\nthis, we are able to form an image of the external world surrounding\r\nus, from perceptions derived only from within, it is because we trace\r\nthe changes in our organism which we have perceived to causes exterior\r\nto it; and from the nature and force of the changes taking place in our\r\norganism draw conclusions as to the nature and force of the external\r\nevents causing them.\r\n\r\nHow we come in general to assume that there is something exterior, and\r\nthat changes perceived by us only in our organism can have causes which\r\nare not in the organism itself, is a question over which metaphysics\r\nhas cudgelled its brain for centuries. So little has it found an\r\nanswer, that, in order to put an end to this difficulty anyhow, it has\r\nsimply denied the very question, and jumped to the conclusion that the\r\n‘I’ has actually no knowledge of a ‘not-I,’ of an external world, and\r\ncannot have it because there is no external world at all, that what we\r\nso call is a creation of our mind, and exists only in our thought as a\r\npresentation, but not outside our ‘I’ as a reality.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact characteristic of the soporific action exercised by\r\nthe sound of a word on the human mind that this wholly senseless\r\ncackle, glib, well arranged and formed into the philosophical system\r\nof idealism, should have thoroughly satisfied for nearly eight\r\ngenerations the greater number of professional metaphysicians, from\r\nBerkeley to Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. These wise men repeated,\r\nin a tone of conviction, the doctrine of the non-existence of the\r\n‘not-I,’ and it did not trouble them that they themselves contradicted\r\nconstantly, in all their actions, their own fustian; that they devoted\r\nthemselves from their birth to their death to an uninterrupted series\r\nof absolutely absurd actions, if there were no objective external\r\nworld; that therefore they themselves recognised their system to be\r\nbut wind and shadow, a childish game with words devoid of sense. And\r\nthe most logical among these grave drivellers, Bishop Berkeley, did\r\nnot even observe that after all he had not obtained, even at the\r\nprice of the total abdication of common sense, the answer he sought\r\nto the fundamental question of knowledge, for his dogmatic idealism\r\ndenies, it is true, the reality of the external world, but admits with\r\nfrivolous thoughtlessness that there are other minds outside of him,\r\nBerkeley, and even a universal mind. Thus, then, even according to\r\nhim, the ‘I’ is not all; there is still something outside of the ‘I,’\r\na ‘not-I’; there does exist an external world, if only under the form\r\nof immaterial spirits. This, however, brings up the question, How does\r\nBerkeley’s ‘I’ come to conceive the existence of something outside of\r\nitself, the existence of a ‘not-I’? That was the question which had\r\nto be answered, and, in spite of its sacrificing the whole world of\r\nphenomena, Berkeley’s idealism, like the idealism of every one of his\r\nsuccessors, makes no reply to it whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMetaphysics could find no answer to the question, because the latter,\r\nas stated by the former, does not admit of an answer. Scientific\r\npsychology--_i.e._, psycho-physiology--does not encounter the same\r\ndifficulties. It does not take the finished ‘I’ of the adult, clearly\r\nconscious of himself, feeling himself distinctly opposed to the ‘not-I’\r\nto the entire external world, but it goes back to the beginnings of\r\nthis ‘I,’ investigates in what manner it is formed, and then finds\r\nthat, at a time when the idea of the existence of a ‘not-I,’ would be\r\nreally inexplicable, this idea, in fact, was absolutely non-existent,\r\nand that, when we do meet it, the ‘I’ has already had experiences which\r\ncompletely explain how it could and must arrive at the formation of the\r\nidea of a ‘not-I.’\r\n\r\nWe may assume that a certain degree of consciousness is the\r\naccompanying phenomenon of every reaction of the protoplasm on external\r\naction--_i.e._, is a fundamental quality of living matter. Even the\r\nsimplest unicellular living organisms move with obvious intention\r\ntowards certain goals, and away from certain points; they distinguish\r\nbetween foods and such materials as are unfit for nutrition; thus\r\nthey have a species of will and judgment, and these two activities\r\npresuppose consciousness.[237] What may be the nature of this\r\nconsciousness localized in protoplasm not yet even differentiated into\r\nnerve-cells, is a thing of which it is impossible for the human mind\r\nto form a definite idea. The only thing we can presuppose with any\r\ncertainty is that in the crepuscular consciousness of a unicellular\r\norganism, the notion of an ‘I’ and a ‘not-I,’ which is opposed to it,\r\ndoes not exist. The cell feels changes in itself, and these changes\r\nprovoke others, in accordance with established bio-chemical or\r\nbio-mechanical laws; it receives an impression to which it responds by\r\na movement, but it has certainly no idea that the impression is caused\r\nby a process in the external world, and that its movement reacts on the\r\nexternal world.\r\n\r\nEven among animals very much higher in the scale, and considerably more\r\nadvanced in differentiation, a consciousness of the ‘Ego,’ properly so\r\ncalled, is inconceivable. How can the ray of a star-fish, the bud of a\r\ntunicate, of a botryllus, the half of a double animal (diplozoon), the\r\ntube of an actinia, or of some other coral polypus, be aware of itself\r\nas a separate ‘I,’ seeing that, though it is an animal, it is at the\r\nsame time a portion of a composite animal, of a colony of animals, and\r\nmust perceive impressions which strike it directly, as well as those\r\nexperienced by a companion of the same colony? Or can certain large\r\nworms, many of the species of Eunice, for example, have an idea of\r\ntheir ‘Ego,’ when they neither feel nor recognise portions of their own\r\nbodies as constituent parts of their individuality, and begin to eat\r\ntheir tails when, by any accident in coiling themselves, it happens to\r\nlie in front of their mouths?\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of the ‘Ego’ is not synonymous with consciousness\r\nin general. While the latter is probably an attribute of all living\r\nmatter, the former is the result of the concordant action of a nervous\r\ntissue highly differentiated and ‘hierarchized,’ or brought into a\r\nrelation of mutual dependence. It appears very late in the series\r\nof organic evolution, and is, up to the present, the highest vital\r\nphenomenon of which we have knowledge. It arises little by little from\r\nexperiences which the organism acquires in the course of the natural\r\nactivity of its constituent parts. Every one of our nerve-ganglia,\r\nevery one of our nerve-fibres, and even every cell, has a subordinate\r\nand faint consciousness of what passes in it. As the whole nervous\r\nsystem of our body has numerous communications between all its parts,\r\nit perceives in its totality something of all the stimulations of its\r\nparts, and the consciousness which accompanies them. In this manner\r\nthere arises in the centre where all the nerve ducts of the whole\r\nbody meet, _i.e._, in the brain, a total consciousness composed of\r\ninnumerable partial consciousnesses, having evidently for its object\r\nonly the processes of its own organism. In the course of its existence,\r\nand that at a very early period, consciousness distinguishes two kinds\r\nof wholly different perceptions. Some appear without preparation,\r\nothers accompanied and preceded by other phenomena. No act of will\r\nprecedes the stimulation of the senses, but such an act does precede\r\nevery conscious movement. Before our senses perceive anything, our\r\nconsciousness has no notion of what they will perceive; before our\r\nmuscles execute a movement, an image of this movement is elaborated\r\nin the brain, or spinal marrow (in the case of a reflex action).\r\nThere exists then, beforehand, a presentation of the movement which\r\nthe muscles will execute. We feel clearly that the immediate cause\r\nof the movement lies in ourselves. On the other hand, we have no\r\nsimilar feelings in regard to sense-impressions. Again, we learn by\r\nthe muscular sense the realization of motor images elaborated by our\r\nconsciousness; on the other hand, we experience nothing similar when\r\nwe elaborate a motor image not having our own muscles exclusively for\r\nits object. We wish, for example, to raise our arm. Our consciousness\r\nelaborates this image, the brachial muscles obey, and consciousness\r\nreceives the communication that the image has been realized by the\r\nbrachial muscles. Next, we wish to raise or throw a stone with our\r\narm. Our consciousness elaborates a motor image, involving our own\r\nmuscles and the stone. When we are executing the desired and meditated\r\nmovement, our consciousness receives sensations from the muscles in\r\nactivity, but not from the stone. Thus it perceives the movements which\r\nare accompanied by muscular sensations, and others which appear without\r\nthis accompaniment.\r\n\r\nIn order thoroughly to comprehend the formation of our consciousness\r\nof the ‘Ego,’ and the presentation of the existence of a ‘non-Ego,’\r\nwe must consider a third point. All the parts, all the cells of our\r\nbody, have their own separate consciousness, which accompanies every\r\none of their excitations. These excitations are occasioned partly by\r\nthe activity of nutrition, of assimilation, of the cleavage of the\r\nnucleus--that is to say, by the vital processes of the cell itself,\r\nand partly by action of the environment. The excitations which proceed\r\nfrom the interior, the bio-chemical and bio-mechanical processes of the\r\ncell, are continued, and endure as long as the life of the cell itself.\r\nThe stimulations which are the result of the action of the environment\r\nonly appear, of course, with this action, _i.e._, not continuously,\r\nbut intermittently. The vital processes in the cell have direct value\r\nand significance only for the cell itself, not for the whole organism;\r\nactions of the environment may become important for the whole organism.\r\nThe principal organ, the brain, acquires the habit of neglecting the\r\nexcitations relating to the interior vital activity of the cell--first,\r\nbecause they are continuous, and we perceive distinctly only a change\r\nof state, not a state itself; and then, because the cell accomplishes\r\nits own functions by its own energy, which renders the interference\r\nof the brain useless. The brain takes notice, on the contrary, of\r\nexcitations which are produced by action _ab extra_--first, because\r\nthey appear with interruptions; and, secondly, because they may\r\nnecessitate an adaptation of the whole organism, which could only take\r\nplace through the intervention of the brain.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the brain has knowledge also of the internal\r\nexcitations of the organism, and only for the reasons already stated\r\nis not, as a general rule, distinctly conscious of them. If through\r\nillness a disturbance is produced in the functions of the single cell,\r\nwe at once become conscious of the processes in the cell--we feel the\r\ndiseased organ, it stimulates our attention; the whole organism is\r\nuncomfortable and out of tune. It is sensations of this kind, which,\r\nin a healthy state, do not distinctly reach our consciousness, that\r\nmake up the sensation of our body, our organic ‘I,’ the so-called\r\ncœnæsthesis or general sensibility.\r\n\r\nCœnæsthesis, the organic dimly-conscious ‘I,’ rises into the clear\r\nconsciousness of the ‘Ego,’ by excitations of the second order,\r\nreaching the brain from the nerves and muscles, for they are stronger\r\nand more distinct than the others, and are interrupted. The brain\r\nlearns the changes produced in the nervous system by external causes,\r\nand the contraction of the muscles. How it has knowledge of the latter\r\nis still obscure. It has been recently asserted that the muscular sense\r\nhas for its seat the nerves of the joints. This is certainly false.\r\nWe have distinct sensations of the contractions of muscles which put\r\nno joint in movement--for example, of the orbicular and constrictor\r\nmuscles. Then there are the cramps and spasms even of isolated muscular\r\nfibres, which likewise do not produce a change of position in the\r\njoints. But in any case the perceptions of muscular sense exist,\r\nhowever they are or are not produced.\r\n\r\nThus consciousness very soon learns that the muscular movements it\r\nperceives are preceded by certain acts accomplished by itself, namely,\r\nthe elaboration of motor images, and the despatch of impulses to the\r\nmuscles. It receives knowledge of these movements twice, one after the\r\nother--it perceives them, first, directly as its own presentation and\r\nact of volition, as a motor image elaborated in the nerve-centres;\r\nand immediately afterwards as an impression arising from the muscular\r\nnerves as accomplished movement. It acquires the habit of connecting\r\nits own acts--those previously elaborated motor images--with the\r\nmuscular movements, and of regarding the latter a consequence of the\r\nformer--in short, of thinking causally. If consciousness has adopted\r\nthe habit of causality, it seeks a cause in all its perceptions, and\r\ncan no longer imagine a perception without a cause. The cause of\r\nmuscular perceptions--that is, of movements consciously willed--it\r\nfinds in itself. The cause of nervous perceptions--that is, the\r\ninformation reported by the nervous system concerning the excitations\r\nwhich it experiences--it does not find in itself. But the latter must\r\nhave a cause. Where is it? As it is not in consciousness, it must\r\nnecessarily exist somewhere else; there must then be something else\r\noutside consciousness, and so consciousness comes, through the habit of\r\ncausal thought, to assume the existence of something outside itself, of\r\na ‘not-I,’ of an external world, and to project into it the cause of\r\nthe excitations which it perceives in the nervous system.\r\n\r\nExperience teaches that the distinction between the ‘I’ and the ‘not-I’\r\nis really only a question of a habit of thought, of a form of thought,\r\nand not of an effective, certain knowledge, which carries in itself\r\nthe criteria of its accuracy and certitude. When, in consequence\r\nof a morbid disturbance, our sensory nerves or their centres of\r\nperception are excited, and consciousness acquires knowledge of this\r\nexcitation, it imputes to it without hesitation, according to its\r\nhabit, an external cause existing in the ‘not-I.’ Hence arise illusions\r\nand hallucinations, which the patient takes for realities, and that\r\nso positively that there is absolutely no means of convincing him\r\nthat he perceives facts passing within him, not outside of him. In\r\nthe same manner consciousness concludes that the movements executed\r\nunconsciously are occasioned by an extraneous will. It perceives the\r\nmovement, but it has not noticed that the habitual internal cause,\r\nviz., a motor image and an act of the will, has preceded it; hence it\r\nplaces the cause of the movement without hesitation in the ‘not-I,’\r\nalthough it resides in the ‘I,’ and is only occasioned by subordinate\r\ncentres, the activity of which remains concealed from consciousness.\r\nThis it is which gives rise to spiritualism, which, in so far as it\r\nis in good faith and not openly a hocus-pocus, is simply a mystical\r\nattempt to explain movements, the real cause of which consciousness\r\ndoes not find in itself, and which it places, in consequence, in the\r\n‘not-I.’\r\n\r\nIn ultimate analysis, the consciousness of the ‘Ego,’ and notably the\r\nopposition of the ‘Ego’ and the ‘non-Ego,’ is an illusion of the senses\r\nand a fallacy of thought. Every organism is related to a species,\r\nand, over and above that, to the universe. It is the direct material\r\ncontinuation of its parents; it is itself continued directly and\r\nmaterially in its descendants. It is composed of the same materials as\r\nthe whole environing world; these materials are constantly penetrating\r\ninto it, transforming it, producing in it all the phenomena of life\r\nand consciousness. All the lines of action of the forces of nature are\r\nprolonged in its interior; it is the scene of the same physical and\r\nchemical processes in action throughout the universe. What pantheism\r\ndivines and clothes in needlessly mystic words is clear, sober fact,\r\nnamely, the unity of nature, in which each organism is also a part\r\nrelated to the whole. Certain parts are more nearly connected; others\r\nare more separated from one another. Consciousness perceives only the\r\nclosely-knit parts of its physical basis, not those more remote. Thus\r\nit falls into the illusion that the parts near together alone belong\r\nto it, and that the more distant are strangers to it, and to consider\r\nitself as an ‘individuum,’ confronting the world as a separate world or\r\nmicrocosm. It does not observe that the ‘I,’ so rigidly posited, has\r\nno fixed limits, but continues and spreads beneath the threshold of\r\nconsciousness, with an ever-diminishing distinctness of separation, to\r\nthe extreme depths of nature, till it blends there with all the other\r\nconstituents of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe may now resume much more briefly the natural history of the ‘I’\r\nand the ‘not-I,’ and present it in a few formulæ. Consciousness is a\r\nfundamental quality of living matter. The highest organism itself is\r\nonly a colony of the simplest organisms--that is to say, of living\r\ncells--differentiated diversely in order to qualify the colony for\r\nhigher functions than the simple cell can accomplish. The collective\r\nor ego-consciousness of the colony is composed of the individual\r\nconsciousness of the parts. The ego-consciousness has an obscure and\r\ndisregarded part which relates to the vital functions of the cells, or\r\nthe cœnæsthesis, and a clear, privileged part which is attentive to the\r\nexcitations of the sensory nerves, and to the voluntary activity of the\r\nmuscles, and which recognises them. Clear consciousness learns from\r\nexperience that acts of will precede voluntary movements. It arrives at\r\nthe assumption of causality. It observes that the sensorial excitations\r\nare not caused by anything contained in itself. It is compelled, in\r\nconsequence, to transfer this cause, the assumption of which it cannot\r\nrenounce, elsewhere, and is necessarily first brought by this to the\r\npresentation of a ‘not-I,’ and afterwards to the development of this\r\n‘not-I’ into an apparent universe.\r\n\r\nThe old spiritualistic psychology, which regards the ‘Ego’ as\r\nsomething entirely different from the body, as a special unitary\r\nsubstance, maintains that this ‘Ego’ considers its own body as\r\nsomething not identical with it, as opposed to the ‘Ego’ properly so\r\ncalled, as something external--in fact, as ‘non-Ego.’ Thus, it denies\r\ncœnæsthesis--that is to say, an absolutely certain empirical fact. We\r\nconstantly have an obscure sensation of the existence of all parts of\r\nour body, and our ego-consciousness immediately experiences a change\r\nif the vital functions of any one of our organs or tissues suffers a\r\ndisturbance.[238]\r\n\r\nDevelopment advances from the unconscious organic ‘I’ to the clear\r\nconscious ‘I,’ and to the conception of the ‘not-I.’ The infant\r\nprobably has cœnæsthesis even before, in any case after, its birth,\r\nfor it feels its vital internal processes, shows satisfaction when\r\nthey are in healthy action, manifests its discomfort by movements and\r\ncries, which are also only a movement of the respiratory and laryngeal\r\nmuscles, when any disturbances appear there, perceives and expresses\r\ngeneral states of the organism, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue.\r\nBut clear consciousness does not yet exist for it; the brain has not\r\nyet taken command over the inferior centres. Sense-impressions are\r\nperhaps perceived, but certainly not yet grouped into ideas; the\r\ngreater part of the movements are preceded by no conscious act of will,\r\nand are only reflex actions--that is, manifestations of those local\r\nconsciousnesses which later become so obscure as to be imperceptible,\r\nwhen the cerebral consciousness has attained its full clearness.\r\nLittle by little the higher centres develop; the child begins to give\r\nheed to its sense-impressions, to form from its perceptions ideas,\r\nand to make voluntary movements adapted to an end. With the awakening\r\nof its conscious will the birth of the consciousness of its ‘Ego’ is\r\nlinked. The child apprehends that it is an individual. But its internal\r\norganic processes occupy it very much more than does the procedure\r\nof the external world, transmitted to it by the sensory nerves, and\r\nits own states fill up its consciousness more or less completely. The\r\nchild is, for this reason, a model of egoism, and, until it reaches a\r\nmore advanced age, is wholly incapable of displaying either attention\r\nor interest in anything at all which is not directly connected with\r\nitself, its needs and inclinations. By the continued culture of his\r\nbrain man finally arrives at that degree of maturity in which he\r\nacquires a just idea of his relations to other men and to Nature. Then\r\nconsciousness pays less and less regard to the vital processes in its\r\nown organism, and more and more to the stimulations of its senses. It\r\nonly notices the former when they reveal pressing necessities; it is,\r\non the contrary, always concerned with the latter when in a waking\r\nstate. The ‘I’ retires decidedly behind the ‘not-I,’ and the image of\r\nthe world fills the greater part of consciousness.\r\n\r\nAs the formation of an ‘I,’ of an individuality clearly conscious of\r\nits separate existence, is the highest achievement of living matter,\r\nso the highest degree of development of the ‘I’ consists in embodying\r\nin itself the ‘not-I,’ in comprehending the world, in conquering\r\negoism, and in establishing close relations with other beings, things\r\nand phenomena. Auguste Comte, and after him Herbert Spencer, have\r\nnamed this stage ‘altruism,’ from the Italian word _altrui_, ‘others.’\r\nThe sexual instinct which forces an individual to seek for another\r\nindividual is as little altruism as the hunger which incites the\r\nhunter to follow an animal in order to kill and eat it. There can be\r\nno question of altruism until an individual concerns himself about\r\nanother being from sympathy or curiosity, and not in order to satisfy\r\nan immediate, pressing necessity of his body, the momentary hunger of\r\nsome organ.\r\n\r\nNot till he attains to altruism is man in a condition to maintain\r\nhimself in society and in nature. To be a social being, man must\r\nfeel with his fellow-creatures, and show himself sensitive to their\r\nopinion about him. Both the one and the other presuppose that he is\r\ncapable of so vividly representing to himself the feelings of his\r\nfellow-creatures as to experience them himself. He who is not capable\r\nof imagining the pain of another with sufficient clearness to suffer\r\nthe same himself will not have compassion, and he who cannot exactly\r\nfeel for himself what impression an action or an omission on his part\r\nwill make on another will have no regard for others. In both cases he\r\nwill soon see himself excluded from the human community as the enemy\r\nof all, and treated as such by all, and very probably he will perish.\r\nAnd to defend himself against destructive natural forces and turn them\r\nto his advantage, man must know them intimately--that is, he must be\r\nable distinctly to picture their effects. A clear presentation of the\r\nfeelings of others, and of the effects of natural forces, presupposes\r\nthe faculty of occupying himself intensively with the ‘not-I.’ While a\r\nman is attending to the ‘not-I,’ he is not thinking of his ‘Ego,’ and\r\nthe latter descends below the level of consciousness. In order that the\r\n‘not-I’ should in this way prevail over the ‘I,’ the sensory nerves\r\nmust properly conduct the external impressions, the cerebral centres of\r\nperception must be sensitive to the excitations of the sensory nerves,\r\nthe highest centres must develop, in a sure, rapid and vigorous manner,\r\nthe perceptions into ideas, unite these into conceptions and judgments,\r\nand, on occasion, transform them into acts of volition and motor\r\nimpulses. And as the greatest part of these different activities is\r\naccomplished by the gray cortex of the frontal lobes, this means that\r\nthis gray cortex must be well developed and work vigorously.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that a sane man appears to us. He perceives little and\r\nrarely his internal excitations, but always and clearly his external\r\nimpressions. His consciousness is filled with images of the external\r\nworld, not with images of the activity of his organs. The unconscious\r\nwork of his inferior centres plays an almost vanishing part by the side\r\nof the fully conscious work of the highest centres. His egoism is no\r\nstronger than is strictly necessary to maintain his individuality, and\r\nhis thoughts and actions are determined by knowledge of Nature and his\r\nfellow-creatures, and by the consideration he owes to them.\r\n\r\nQuite otherwise is the spectacle offered by the degenerate person. His\r\nnervous system is not normal. In what the digression from the norm\r\nultimately consists we do not know. Very probably the cell of the\r\ndegenerate is formed a little differently from that of sane men, the\r\nparticles of the protoplasm are otherwise and less regularly disposed;\r\nthe molecular movements take place, in consequence, in a less free\r\nand rapid, less rhythmic and vigorous, manner. This is, however, a\r\nmere undemonstrable hypothesis. Nevertheless, it cannot reasonably be\r\ndoubted that all the bodily signs or ‘stigmata’ of degeneration, all\r\nthe arrests and inequalities of development that have been observed,\r\nhave their origin in a bio-chemical and bio-mechanical derangement of\r\nthe nerve-cell, or, perhaps, of the cell in general.\r\n\r\nIn the mental life of the degenerate the anomaly of his nervous system\r\nhas, as a consequence, the incapacity of attaining to the highest\r\ndegree of development of the individual, namely, the freely coming out\r\nfrom the factitious limits of individuality, _i.e._, altruism. As to\r\nthe relation of his ‘Ego’ to his ‘non-Ego,’ the degenerate man remains\r\na child all his life. He scarcely appreciates or even perceives the\r\nexternal world, and is only occupied with the organic processes in his\r\nown body. He is more than egoistical, he is an ego-maniac.\r\n\r\nHis ego-mania may spring directly from different circumstances of his\r\norganism. His sensory nerves may be obtuse, are, in consequence, but\r\nfeebly stimulated by the external world, transmit slowly and badly\r\ntheir stimuli to the brain, and are not in a condition to incite it\r\nto a sufficiently vigorous perceptive and ideational activity. Or\r\nhis sensory nerves may work moderately well, but the brain is not\r\nsufficiently excitable, and does not perceive properly the impressions\r\nwhich are transmitted to it from the external world.\r\n\r\nThe obtuseness of the degenerate is attested by almost all observers.\r\nFrom the almost illimitable number of facts which could be adduced\r\non this point, we will only give a very concise, but sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic selection. ‘Among many idiots,’ says Sollier, ‘there\r\nis no distinction between sweet and bitter. When sugar and colocynth\r\nare administered to them alternately, they manifest no change of\r\nsensation.... Properly speaking, taste does not exist among them....\r\nBesides this, there are perversions of taste. We are not speaking\r\nhere of complete idiots ... but even of imbeciles who eat ordure or\r\nrepulsive things ... even their own excrements.... The same remarks\r\napply to smell. Perhaps sensibility appears still more absolutely\r\nobtuse for smells than for taste.... Tactile sensibility is very obtuse\r\nin general, but it is always uniformly so.... Sometimes it might be a\r\nquestion whether there is not complete anæsthesia.’[239] Lombroso has\r\nexamined the general sensitiveness of skin in sixty-six criminals, and\r\nhas found it obtuse in thirty-eight among them, and unequal in the two\r\nhalves of the body in forty-six.[240] In a later work he sums up in\r\nthese words his observations of sensorial acuteness in the degenerate:\r\n‘Inaccessible to the feeling of pain, themselves without feeling, they\r\nnever understand pain even in others.’[241] Ribot traces the ‘diseases\r\nof personality’ (that is, the false ideas of the ‘I’) to ‘organic\r\ndisturbances, of which the first result is to depress the faculty of\r\nfeeling in general; the second, to pervert it.’ ‘A young man whose\r\nconduct had always been excellent suddenly gave himself up to the worst\r\ninclinations. It was ascertained that in his mental condition there\r\nwas no sign of evident alienation, but it could be seen that the whole\r\nouter surface of the skin had become absolutely insensible.’ ‘It may\r\nseem strange that weak and false sensitivity ... that is, that simple\r\ndisturbances or sensorial alterations should disorganize the “Ego.”\r\nNevertheless, observation proves it.’[242] Maudsley[243] describes some\r\ncases of degeneration among children whose skin was insensible, and\r\nremarks: ‘They cannot feel impressions as they naturally should feel\r\nthem, nor adjust themselves to their surroundings, with which they are\r\nin discord; and the motor outcomes of the perverted affections of self\r\nare accordingly of a meaningless and destructive character.’[244]\r\n\r\nThe defective sensibility of the degenerate, confirmed by all\r\nobservers, is, moreover, susceptible of different interpretations.\r\nWhereas many consider it a consequence of the pathological condition\r\nof the sensory nerves, others believe that the perturbation has its\r\nseat, not in these nerves, but in the brain; not in the ducts, but\r\nin the centres of perception. To quote one of the most eminent among\r\nthe psycho-physiologists of the new school, Binet[245] has proved\r\nthat, ‘if a portion of the body of a person is insensible, he is\r\nignorant of what passes there; but, on the other hand, the nervous\r\ncentres in connection with this insensible region can continue to\r\nact; the result is that certain acts, often simple, but sometimes very\r\ncomplicated, can be accomplished in the body of a hysterical subject,\r\nwithout his knowledge; much more, these acts can be of a psychical\r\nnature, and manifest an intelligence which will be distinct from that\r\nof the subject, and will constitute a second “I” co-existent with the\r\nfirst. For a long time there was a misconception of the true nature\r\nof hysterical anæsthesia, and it was compared to a common anæsthesia\r\nfrom organic causes, due, for example, to the interruption of afferent\r\nnerves. This view must be wholly abandoned, and we know now that\r\nhysterical anæsthesia is not a true insensibility; it is insensibility\r\nfrom unconsciousness from mental disaggregation; in a word, it is\r\npsychical insensibility.’\r\n\r\nMost frequently it is not a question of simple cases, where it is the\r\nsensory nerves alone, or only the cerebral centres which work badly,\r\nbut of mixed cases, where the two apparatuses have a diversely varying\r\npart in the disturbance. But whether the nerves do not conduct the\r\nimpressions to the brain, or the brain does not perceive, or does not\r\nraise the impressions brought to it into consciousness, the result is\r\nalways the same, viz., the external world will not be correctly and\r\ndistinctly grasped by consciousness, the ‘not-I’ will not be suitably\r\nrepresented in consciousness, the ‘I’ will not experience the necessary\r\nderivation of the exclusive preoccupation with the processes taking\r\nplace in its own organism.\r\n\r\nThe natural healthy connection between organic sensations and\r\nsense-perceptions is much more strongly displaced when to the\r\ninsensibility of the sensory nerves, or of the centres of perception,\r\nor both, is added an unhealthily modified and intensified vital\r\nactivity of the organs. Then the organic ego-sensibility, or\r\ncœnæsthesis, advances irrepressibly into the foreground, overshadowing\r\nin great part or wholly the perceptions of the external world in\r\nconsciousness, which no longer takes notice of anything but the\r\ninterior processes of the organism. In this way there originates that\r\npeculiar hyper-stimulation or emotionalism constituting, as we have\r\nseen, the fundamental phenomenon of the intellectual life of the\r\ndegenerate. For the fundamental emotional tone, despairing or joyful,\r\nangry or tearful, which determines the colour of his presentations as\r\nwell as the course of his thoughts, is the consequence of phenomena\r\ntaking place in his nerves, vessels and glands.[246] The consciousness\r\nof the emotionally degenerate subject is filled with obsessions which\r\nare not inspired by the events of the external world, and by impulsions\r\nwhich are not the reaction against external stimulation. To this is\r\nadded next the unfailing weakness of will of the degenerate person,\r\nwhich makes it impossible for him to suppress his obsessions, to resist\r\nhis impulsions, to control his fundamental moods, to keep his higher\r\ncentres to the attentive pursuit of objective phenomena. According to\r\nthe saying of the poet, the necessary result of these conditions is\r\nthat the world must be differently reflected in such heads than it is\r\nin normal ones. The external world, the ‘not-I,’ either does not exist\r\nat all in the consciousness of an emotionally degenerate subject, or it\r\nis merely represented there as on a faintly reflecting surface, by a\r\nscarcely recognisable, wholly colourless image, or, as in a concave or\r\nconvex mirror, by a completely distorted, false image; consciousness,\r\non the other hand, is imperiously monopolized by the somatic ‘I,’ which\r\ndoes not permit the mind to be occupied with anything but the painful\r\nor tumultuous processes taking place in the depths of the organs.\r\n\r\nBadly-conducting sensory nerves, obtuse perceptive centres in the\r\nbrain, weakness of will with its resulting incapacity of attention,\r\nmorbidly irregular and violent vital processes in the cells, are\r\ntherefore the organic basis on which ego-mania develops.\r\n\r\nThe ego-maniac must of necessity immensely over-estimate his own\r\nimportance and the significance of all his actions, for he is only\r\nengrossed with himself, and but little or not at all with external\r\nthings. He is therefore not in a position to comprehend his relation\r\nto other men and the universe, and to appreciate properly the part he\r\nhas to play in the aggregate of social institutions. There might at\r\nthis juncture be an inclination to confound ego-mania with megalomania,\r\nbut there is a characteristic difference between the two states.\r\nMegalomania, it is true, is itself, like its clinical complement, the\r\ndelusion of persecution, occasioned by morbid processes within the\r\norganism obliging consciousness perpetually to be attending to its own\r\nsomatic ‘Ego.’ More especially the unnaturally increased bio-chemical\r\nactivity of the organs gives rise to the pleasantly extravagant\r\npresentations of megalomania, while retarded or morbidly aberrant\r\nactivity gives rise to the painful presentations of the delusion of\r\npersecution.[247] In megalomania, however, as in the delusion of\r\npersecution, the patient is constantly engrossed with the external\r\nworld and with men; in ego-mania, on the contrary, he almost completely\r\nwithdraws himself from them. In the systematically elaborated delirium\r\nof the megalomaniac and persecution-maniac, the ‘not-I’ plays the most\r\nprominent part. The patient accounts for the importance his ‘Ego’\r\nobtains in his own eyes by the invention of a grand social position\r\nuniversally recognised, or by the inexorable hostility of powerful\r\npersons, or groups of persons. He is Pope, or Emperor, and his\r\npersecutors are the chief men in the State, or great social powers, the\r\npolice, the clergy, etc. His delirium, in consequence, takes account\r\nof the State and society; he admits their importance, and attaches\r\nthe greatest value, in one case, to the homage, in the other to the\r\nenmity, of his neighbours. The ego-maniac, on the contrary, does not\r\nregard it as necessary to dream of himself as occupying some invented\r\nsocial position. He does not require the world or its appreciation to\r\njustify in his own eyes himself as the sole object of his own interest.\r\nHe does not see the world at all. Other people simply do not exist for\r\nhim. The whole ‘non-Ego’ appears in his consciousness merely as a vague\r\nshadow or a thin cloud. The idea does not even occur to him that he is\r\nsomething out of the common, that he is superior to other people, and\r\nfor this reason either admired or hated; he is alone in the world; more\r\nthan that, he alone is the world and everything else, men, animals,\r\nthings are unimportant accessories, not worth thinking about.\r\n\r\nThe less diseased are the conducting media, the centres of nutrition,\r\nperception and volition, so much the weaker naturally will the\r\nego-mania be, and so much the more harmlessly will it be manifested.\r\nIts least objectionable expression is the comic importance which\r\nthe ego-maniac often attributes to his sensations, inclinations and\r\nactivities. Is he a painter? he has no doubt that the whole history\r\nof the universe only hinges on painting, and on his pictures in\r\nparticular. Is he a writer of prose or verse? he is convinced that\r\nhumanity has no other care, or at least no more serious care, than for\r\nverses and books. Let it not be objected that this is not peculiar\r\nto ego-maniacs, but is the case with the vast majority of mankind.\r\nAssuredly everyone thinks what he is doing is important, and that man\r\nwould not be worth much who performed his work so heedlessly and so\r\nsuperficially, with so little pleasure and conscientiousness, that he\r\nhimself could not look upon it with respect. But the great difference\r\nbetween the rational and sane man and the ego-maniac is, that the\r\nformer sees clearly how subordinate his occupation is to the rest of\r\nhumanity, although it fills his life and exacts his best powers, while\r\nthe latter can never imagine that any exertion to which he devotes\r\nhis time and efforts can appear to others as unimportant and even\r\npuerile. An honest cobbler, resoleing an old boot, gives himself up\r\nheart and soul to his work, nevertheless he admits that there are far\r\nmore interesting and important things for humanity than the repairing\r\nof damaged sole-leather. The ego-maniac, on the contrary, if he is a\r\nwriter, does not hesitate to declare, like Mallarmé, ‘The world was\r\nmade to lead up to a fine book.’ This absurd exaggeration of one’s own\r\noccupations and interests produces in literature the Parnassians and\r\nthe Æsthetes.\r\n\r\nIf degeneration is deeper, and ego-mania is stronger, the latter no\r\nlonger assumes the comparatively innocent form of total absorption in\r\npoetic and artistic cooings, but manifests itself as an immorality,\r\nwhich may amount to moral madness. The tendency to commit actions\r\ninjurious to himself or society is aroused now and then even in a\r\nsane man when some obnoxious desire demands gratification, but he has\r\nthe will and the power to suppress it. The degenerate ego-maniac is\r\ntoo feeble of will to control his impulsions, and cannot determine\r\nhis actions and thoughts by a regard to the welfare of society,\r\nbecause society is not at all represented in his consciousness. He\r\nis a solitary, and is insensible to the moral law framed for life in\r\nsociety, and not for the isolated individual. It is evident that for\r\nRobinson Crusoe the penal code did not exist. Alone on his island,\r\nhaving only Nature to deal with, it is obvious he could neither kill,\r\nsteal, nor pillage in the sense of the penal code. He could only commit\r\nmisdemeanours against himself. Want of insight and of self-control\r\nare the only immoralities possible to him. The ego-maniac is a mental\r\nRobinson Crusoe, who in his imagination lives alone on an island, and\r\nis at the same time a weak creature, powerless to govern himself. The\r\nuniversal moral law does not exist for him, and the only thing he may\r\npossibly see and avow, perhaps also regret a little, is that he sins\r\nagainst the moral law of the solitary, _i.e._, against the necessity of\r\ncontrolling instincts in so far as they are injurious to himself.\r\n\r\nMorality--not that learnt mechanically, but that which we feel as\r\nan internal necessity--has become, in the course of thousands of\r\ngenerations, an organized instinct. For this reason, like all other\r\norganized instincts, it is exposed to ‘perversion,’ to aberration.\r\nThe effect of this is that an organ, or the whole organism, works in\r\nopposition to its normal task and its natural laws, and cannot work\r\notherwise.[248] In perversion of taste the patient seeks greedily\r\nto swallow all that ordinarily provokes the deepest repugnance,\r\n_i.e._, is instinctively recognised as noxious, and rejected for\r\nthat reason--decaying organic matter, ordure, pus, spittle, etc. In\r\nperversion of smell he prefers the odours of putrefaction to the\r\nperfume of flowers. In perversion of the sexual appetite he has desires\r\nwhich are directly contrary to the purpose of the instinct, _i.e._,\r\nthe preservation of the species. In perversion of the moral sense the\r\npatient is attracted by, and feels delight in, acts which fill the sane\r\nman with disgust and horror. If this particular perversion is added\r\nto ego-mania, we have before us not merely the obtuse indifference\r\ntowards crime which characterizes moral madness, but delight in crime.\r\nThe ego-maniac of this kind is no longer merely insensible to good\r\nand evil, and incapable of discriminating between them, but he has a\r\ndecided predilection for evil, esteems it in others, does it himself\r\nevery time he can act according to his inclination, and finds in it the\r\npeculiar beauty that the sane man finds in good.\r\n\r\nThe moral derangement of an ego-maniac, with or without perverted moral\r\ninstincts, will naturally manifest itself in ways varying according\r\nto the social class to which he belongs, as well as according to his\r\npersonal idiosyncrasies. If he is a member of the disinherited class,\r\nhe is simply either a fallen or degraded being, whom opportunity has\r\nmade a thief, who lives in horrible promiscuity with his sisters or\r\ndaughters, etc., or is a criminal from habit and profession. If he is\r\ncultivated and well-to-do, or in a commanding position, he commits\r\nmisdemeanours peculiar to the upper classes which have as their object\r\nnot the gratification of material needs, but of other kinds of craving.\r\nHe becomes a Don Juan of the drawing-room, and carries shame and\r\ndishonour without hesitation into the family of his best friend. He is\r\na legacy-hunter, a traitor to those who trust in him, an intriguer, a\r\nsower of discord, and a liar. On the throne he may even develop into a\r\nrapacious animal, and to a universal conqueror. With a limited tether\r\nhe becomes Charles the Bad the Count d’Evreux and King of Navarre,\r\nGilles de Rais, the prototype of Blue Beard, or Cæsar Borgia; and,\r\nwith a wider range, Napoleon I. If his nervous system is not strong\r\nenough to elaborate imperious impulsions, or if his muscles are too\r\nfeeble to obey such impulsions, all these criminal inclinations remain\r\nunsatisfied, and only expend themselves by way of his imagination. The\r\nperverted ego-maniac is then only a platonic or theoretic malefactor,\r\nand if he embraces the literary career, he will concoct philosophic\r\nsystems to justify his depravity, or will employ an accommodating\r\nrhetoric in verse and prose to celebrate it, bedizen it and present\r\nit under as seductive a form as possible. We then find ourselves in\r\nthe presence of the literary phases called Diabolism and Decadentism.\r\n‘Diaboliques’ and ‘décadents’ are distinguished from ordinary criminals\r\nmerely in that the former content themselves with dreaming and writing,\r\nwhile the latter have the resolution and strength to act. But they have\r\nthis bond in common, of being both of them ‘anti-social beings.’[249]\r\n\r\nA second characteristic which is shared by all ego-maniacs is their\r\nincapacity to adapt themselves to the conditions in which they live,\r\nwhether they assert their anti-social inclinations in thought or\r\naction, in writings or as criminals. This want of adaptability is one\r\nof the most striking peculiarities of the degenerate, and it is to them\r\na source of constant suffering, and finally of ruin. It is a necessary\r\nresult, however, of the constitution of his central nervous system. The\r\nindispensable premise of adaptation is the having an exact presentation\r\nof the facts to which a man must adapt himself.[250] I cannot avoid the\r\nruts in the road if I do not see them; I cannot ward off the blow I\r\ndo not see coming; it is impossible to thread a needle if its eye is\r\nnot seen with sufficient clearness, and if the thread is not carried\r\nwith steady hand to the right spot. All this is so elementary it is\r\nscarcely necessary to say it. What we term power over Nature is, in\r\nfact, adaptation to Nature. It is an inexact expression to say we make\r\nthe forces of Nature subject to us. In reality we observe them, we\r\nlearn to know their peculiarities, and we manage so that the tendencies\r\nof natural forces and our own desires coincide. We construct a wheel\r\nat the point where the water power, by natural law, must fall, and we\r\nhave then the advantage that the wheel turns according to our needs.\r\nWe know that electricity flows along copper wire, and so, with cunning\r\nsubmission to its peculiar ways, we lay down copper lines to the place\r\nwhere we want it, and where its action would be useful to us. Without\r\nknowledge of Nature, therefore, no adaptation, and without adaptation\r\nno possibility of profiting by its forces. Now, the degenerate subject\r\ncannot adapt himself, because he has no clear idea of the circumstances\r\nto which he ought to adapt himself, and he does not obtain from them\r\nany clear idea, because, as we know, he has bad nerve-conductors,\r\nobtuse centres of perception, and feeble attention.\r\n\r\nThe active cause of all adaptation, as of all effort in general--and\r\nadaptation is nothing else than an effort of a particular kind--is\r\nthe wish to satisfy some organic necessity, or to escape from some\r\ndiscomfort. In other words, the aim of adaptation is to give feelings\r\nof pleasure, and to diminish or suppress the feelings of discomfort.\r\nThe being incapable of self-adaptation is for this reason far less\r\nable to procure agreeable, and avoid disagreeable, sensations than the\r\nnormal being; he runs up against every corner, because he does not know\r\nhow to avoid them; and he longs in vain for the luscious pear, because\r\nhe does not know how to catch hold of the branch on which it hangs. The\r\nego-maniac is a type of such a being. He must, therefore, necessarily\r\nsuffer from the world and from men. Hence at heart he is bad-tempered,\r\nand turns in wrathful discontent against Nature, society and public\r\ninstitutions, irritated and offended by them, because he does not know\r\nhow to accommodate himself to them. He is in a constant state of revolt\r\nagainst all that exists, and contrives how he may destroy it, or, at\r\nleast, dreams of destruction. In a celebrated passage Henri Taine\r\nindicates ‘exaggerated self-esteem’ and ‘dogmatic argument’ as the\r\nroots of Jacobinism.[251] This leads to contempt for and rejection of\r\ninstitutions already established, and hence not invented or chosen by\r\nhimself. He considers the social edifice absurd because it is not ‘a\r\nwork of logic,’ but of history.\r\n\r\nBesides these two roots of Jacobinism which Taine has brought to\r\nlight, there is yet another, and the most important, that has escaped\r\nhis attention, viz., the inability of the degenerate to adapt himself\r\nto given circumstances. The ego-maniac is condemned by his natural\r\norganization to be a pessimist and a Jacobin. But the revolutions he\r\nwishes for, preaches, and perhaps effectively accomplishes, are barren\r\nas regards progress. He is, as a revolutionary, what an inundation or\r\ncyclone would be as a street-sweeper. He does not clear the ground\r\nwith conscious aim, but blindly destroys. This distinguishes him\r\nfrom the clear-minded innovator, the true revolutionary, who is a\r\nreformer, leading suffering and stagnating humanity from time to time\r\nby toilsome paths into a new Canaan. The reformer hurls down with\r\npitiless violence, if violence is necessary, the ruins which have\r\nbecome obstacles, in order to make way for useful constructions; the\r\nego-maniac raves against everything that stands upright, whether\r\nuseful or useless, and does not think of clearing the building-ground\r\nafter the devastation; his pleasure consists in seeing heaps of\r\nrubbish overgrown by noxious weeds where once walls and gables reared\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere is an impassable gulf between the sane revolutionary and the\r\nego-maniac Jacobin. The former has positive ideals, the latter has not.\r\nThe former knows what he is striving for; the latter has no conception\r\nhow that which irritates him could be changed for the better. His\r\nthoughts do not reach so far; he never troubles himself to question\r\nwhat will replace the things destroyed. He knows only that everything\r\nfrets him, and he desires to vent his muddled and blustering ill-humour\r\non all around him. Hence it is characteristic that the foolish\r\nnecessity to revolt of this kind of revolutionary frequently turns\r\nagainst imaginary evils, follows puerile aims, or even fights against\r\nthose laws which are wise and beneficent. Here they form a ‘league\r\nagainst lifting the hat in saluting’; there they oppose compulsory\r\nvaccination; another time they rise in protest against taking the\r\ncensus of the population; and they have the ridiculous audacity to\r\nconduct these silly campaigns with the same speeches and attitudes\r\nthat the true revolutionaries assume--for example, in the service of\r\nsuppression of slavery, or liberty of thought.\r\n\r\nTo the ego-maniac’s incapacity for adaptation is often added the mania\r\nfor destruction, or clastomania, which is so frequently observed among\r\nidiots and imbeciles, and in some forms of insanity.[252] In a child\r\nthe instinct of destruction is normal. It is the first manifestation\r\nof the desire to exert muscular strength. Very soon, however, the\r\ndesire is aroused to exert its strength, not in destroying, but in\r\ncreating. Now, the act of creating has a psychic premise, viz.,\r\nattention. This being absent in the degenerate, the impulse to destroy,\r\nwhich can be gratified without attention, by disorderly and casual\r\nmovements, does not rise in them to the instinct of creation.\r\n\r\nHence, discontent as the consequence of incapacity of adaptation, want\r\nof sympathy with his fellow-creatures arising from weak representative\r\ncapacity, and the instinct of destruction, as the result of arrested\r\ndevelopment of mind, together constitute the anarchist, who, according\r\nto the degree of his impulsions, either merely writes books and makes\r\nspeeches at popular meetings, or has recourse to a dynamite bomb.\r\n\r\nFinally, in its extreme degree of development, ego-mania leads to that\r\nfolly of Caligula in which the unbalanced mind boasts of being ‘a\r\nlaughing lion,’ believes himself above all restraints of morality or\r\nlaw, and wishes the whole of humanity had one single head that he might\r\ncut it off.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has hitherto followed me will now, I hope, quite\r\ncomprehend the psychology of ego-mania. As I have stated above,\r\nconsciousness of the ‘Ego’ originates from the sensations of the\r\nvital processes in all parts of our body, and the conception of\r\nthe ‘non-Ego’ from changes in our organs of special sense. How,\r\ngenerally speaking, we arrive at the assumption of the existence of\r\na ‘not-I,’ I have explained above in detail, hence it is unnecessary\r\nto repeat it here. If we wish to leave the firm soil of positively\r\nestablished facts, and risk ourselves on the somewhat shaky ground of\r\nprobable assumptions, we may say that consciousness of the ‘Ego’ has\r\nits anatomical basis in the sympathetic system, and the conception\r\nof the ‘not-I’ in the cerebro-spinal system. In a healthy man the\r\nperception of vital internal facts does not rise above the level of\r\nconsciousness. The brain receives its stimulations far more from\r\nthe sensory, than from the sympathetic nerves. In consciousness the\r\npresentation of the external world greatly outweighs the consciousness\r\nof the ‘Ego.’ In the degenerate, either (1) vital internal facts\r\nare morbidly intensified, or proceed abnormally, and are therefore\r\nconstantly perceived by consciousness; or (2) the sensory nerves\r\nare obtuse, and the perceptional centres weak and sluggish; or (3)\r\nperhaps these two deviations from the norm co-exist. The result in\r\nall three cases is that the notion of the ‘Ego’ is far more strongly\r\nrepresented in consciousness than the image of the external world. The\r\nego-maniac, consequently, neither knows nor grasps the phenomenon of\r\nthe universe. The effect of this is a want of interest and sympathy,\r\nand an incapacity to adapt himself to nature and humanity. The absence\r\nof feeling, and the incapacity of adaptation, frequently accompanied\r\nby perversion of the instincts and impulses, make the ego-maniac an\r\nanti-social being. He is a moral lunatic, a criminal, a pessimist,\r\nan anarchist, a misanthrope, and he is all these, either in his\r\nthoughts and his feelings, or also in his actions. The struggle\r\nagainst the anti-social ego-maniac, his expulsion from the social\r\nbody, are necessary functions of the latter; and if it is not capable\r\nof accomplishing it, it is a sign of waning vital power or serious\r\nailment. Toleration, and, above all, admiration, of the ego-maniac,\r\nbe he one in theory or in practice, is, so to speak, a proof that the\r\nkidneys of the social organism do not accomplish their task, that\r\nsociety suffers from Bright’s disease.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters we shall study the forms under which\r\nego-mania manifests itself in literature, and we shall find occasion to\r\ntreat in detail of many points to which at this stage mere allusion has\r\nbeen sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPARNASSIANS AND DIABOLISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has become the custom to designate the French Parnassians a school,\r\nbut those who are comprised under this denomination have always\r\nrefused to allow themselves to be included under a common name. ‘The\r\nParnassus?’ ... exclaimed one of the most undoubted Parnassians, M.\r\nCatulle Mendès.[253] ‘We have never been a school!... The Parnassus! We\r\nhave not even written a preface!... The Parnassus originated from the\r\nnecessity of reaction against the looseness of poetry issuing from the\r\nadherents of Murger, Charles Bataille, Amédée Rolland, Jean du Boys;\r\nthen it became a league of minds, who sympathized in matters of art....’\r\n\r\nThe name ‘Parnassiens’ was, in fact, applied to a whole series of poets\r\nand writers who have scarcely a point in common between them. They\r\nare united by a purely external bond; their works have been brought\r\nout by the Parisian editor Alphonse Lemerre, who was able to make\r\nParnassians, as the editor Cotta, in the first half of this century,\r\nmade German classics. The designation itself emanates from a sort of\r\nalmanac of the Muses, which Catulle Mendès published in 1860 under the\r\ntitle, _Le Parnasse contemporain: recueil de vers nouveaux_, and which\r\ncontains contributions from almost all the poets of the period.\r\n\r\nWith most of the names of this numerous group I do not need to concern\r\nmyself, for those who bear them are not degenerate, but honest average\r\nmen, correctly twittering what others have first sung to them. They\r\nhave exercised no sort of direct influence on contemporary thought,\r\nand have only indirectly contributed to strengthen the action of a\r\nfew leaders by grouping themselves around them in the attitude of\r\ndisciples, and in permitting them thus to present themselves with an\r\nimposing retinue, which always makes an impression on vacuous minds.\r\n\r\nThe leaders alone are of importance in my inquiries. It is of them\r\nwe think when we speak of the Parnassians, and it is from their\r\npeculiarities that the artistic theory attributed to _Le Parnasse_ has\r\nbeen derived. Embodied most completely in Théophile Gautier, it can\r\nbe summed up in two words: perfection of form and _impassibilité_, or\r\nimpassiveness.\r\n\r\nTo Gautier and his disciples the form is everything in poetry; the\r\nsubstance has no importance. ‘A poet,’ says he,[254] ‘say what you\r\nwill, is a labourer; he ought not to have more intelligence than a\r\nlabourer, or know any other trade than his own, otherwise he will do\r\nit badly. I hold the mania that there is for putting them on an ideal\r\npedestal is perfectly absurd; nothing is less ideal than a poet....\r\nThe poet is a keyboard [_clavecin_], and nothing more. Every idea\r\nin passing lays its finger on a key; the key vibrates and gives its\r\nnote, that is all.’ In another place he says: ‘For the poet, words\r\nhave in themselves, and outside the sense they express, a beauty and\r\nvalue of their own, like precious stones as yet uncut, and set in\r\nbracelets, necklaces, or rings; they charm the connoisseur who looks\r\nat them, and sorts them with his finger in the little bowl where they\r\nare stored.’[255] Gustave Flaubert, another worshipper of words, takes\r\nentirely this view of the subject when he exclaims:[256] ‘A beautiful\r\nverse meaning nothing, is superior to a verse less beautiful meaning\r\nsomething.’ By the words ‘beautiful’ and ‘less beautiful,’ Flaubert\r\nhere understands ‘names with triumphant syllables, sounding like the\r\nblast of clarions,’ or ‘radiant words, words of light.’[257] Gautier\r\nonly credited Racine, for whom he, a romanticist, naturally had a\r\nprofound contempt, with one verse of any value:\r\n\r\n  ‘La fille de Minos et de Pasiphae.’\r\n\r\nThe most instructive application of this theory is found in a piece of\r\npoetry by Catulle Mendès, entitled _Récapitulation_, which begins as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  ‘Rose, Emmeline,\r\n  Margueridette,\r\n      Odette,\r\n  Alix, Aline.\r\n\r\n  ‘Paule, Hippolyte,\r\n  Lucy, Lucile,\r\n      Cécile,\r\n  Daphné, Mélite.\r\n\r\n  ‘Artémidore,\r\n  Myrrha, Myrrhine,\r\n      Périne,\r\n  Naïs, Eudore.’\r\n\r\nEleven stanzas of the same sort follow, which I will dispense with\r\nreproducing, and then this final strophe:\r\n\r\n  ‘Zulma, Zélie,\r\n  Régine, Reine,\r\n      Irène!...\r\n  Et j’en oublie.’[258]\r\n\r\n‘And I forget the rest’--this is the only one of the sixty lines of\r\nthe piece which has any sense, the fifty-nine others being composed of\r\nwomen’s names only.\r\n\r\nWhat Catulle Mendès intends here is clear enough. He wishes to show the\r\nstate of a libertine’s soul, who revels in the remembrance of all the\r\nwomen he has loved, or with whom he has flirted. In the mind of the\r\nreader the enumeration of their names is to give rise to voluptuous\r\nimages of a troop of young girls, ministrants of pleasure, of pictures\r\nof a harem or of the paradise of Mahomet. But apart from the length\r\nof the list, which makes the piece insupportably wearisome and\r\nchilling, Mendès does not attain the desired effect for yet a second\r\nreason--because his artificiality betrays at the first glance the\r\nprofound insincerity of his pretended emotion. When before the mind of\r\na gallant the figures of the Phyllises of his pastoral idylls present\r\nthemselves, and he really feels the necessity of tenderly murmuring\r\ntheir names, he certainly does not think of arranging these names as a\r\nplay on words (Alix--Aline, Lucy--Lucile, Myrrha--Myrrhine, etc.). If\r\nhe is cold-blooded enough to give himself up to this barren desk-work,\r\nhe cannot possibly find himself in the lascivious ecstasy which the\r\npiece is supposed to express and impart. This emotion, immoral and\r\nvulgar in its boasting, would still have the right, like every genuine\r\naffection of the soul, of being lyrically expressed. But a list of\r\nunmeaning names, artificially combined, and arranged according to\r\ntheir assonance, implies nothing. According to the art theory of the\r\nParnassians, however, _Récapitulation_ is poetry--nay, the ideal of\r\npoetry--for it ‘ne signifie rien,’ as Flaubert requires, and is wholly\r\ncomposed of words which, according to Th. Gautier, ‘ont en eux-mêmes\r\nune beauté et une valeur propres.’\r\n\r\nAnother eminent Parnassian, Théodore de Banville,[259] without pushing\r\nto its extreme limits, with the intrepid logic of Catulle Mendès,\r\nthe theory of verbal resonance bare of all meaning, has professed it\r\nwith a sincerity to which homage is due. ‘I charge you,’ he exclaims\r\nto poets in embryo, ‘to read as much as possible, dictionaries,\r\nencyclopædias, technical works treating of all the professions, and\r\nof all the special sciences, catalogues of libraries and of auctions,\r\nhandbooks of museums--in short, all the books which can increase\r\nyour stock of words, and give you instruction on their exact sense,\r\nproper or figurative. Directly your head is thus furnished you will\r\nbe already well prepared to find rhymes.’ The only essential thing in\r\npoetry, according to Banville, is to catch rhymes. To compose a piece\r\nof poetry on any subject, he teaches his disciples: ‘All the rhymes on\r\nthis subject must first of all be known. The remainder, the soldering,\r\nthat which the poet must add to stop up the holes with the hand of an\r\nartist and workman--these are called the plugs. I should like to see\r\nthose who counsel us to avoid the plugs bind two planks together with\r\nthe help of thought.’ The poet--Banville thus sums up his doctrine--has\r\nno ideas in his brain; he has only sounds, rhymes, and play on words\r\n(_calembours_). This play on words inspires his ideas, or his simulacra\r\nof ideas.\r\n\r\nGuyau rightly uses this criticism with regard to the æsthetic theory\r\nof the Parnassians established by Banville.[260] ‘The search for\r\nrhyme, pushed to the extreme, tends to make the poet lose the habit\r\nof logically connecting his ideas--that is to say, in reality to\r\nthink--for to think, as Kant has said, is to unite and to bind. To\r\nrhyme, on the contrary, is to place in juxtaposition words necessarily\r\nunconnected.... The cult of rhyme for rhyme’s sake introduces into the\r\nbrain itself of the poet, little by little, a kind of disorder and\r\npermanent chaos; all the usual laws of association, all the logic of\r\nthought is destroyed in order to be replaced by the chance encounter\r\nof sounds.... Periphrasis and metaphor are the only resources for good\r\nrhyming.... The impossibility in seeking for rich rhymes, of remaining\r\nsimple, involves in its turn a consequent risk of a certain lack of\r\nsincerity. Freshness of spontaneous feeling will disappear in the too\r\nconsummate artist in words; he will lose that respect for thought as\r\nsuch which ought to be the first quality of the writer.’\r\n\r\nWhere Guyau commits an error is when he says that the cult of rhyme\r\nfor rhyme’s sake ‘introduces into the brain even of the poet a kind\r\nof disorder and permanent chaos.’ The proposition must be reversed.\r\n‘Permanent chaos’ and ‘disorder’ in the brain of the poet are there\r\nalready; the exaggeration of the importance of rhyme is only a\r\nconsequence of this state of mind. Here we have again to deal with\r\na form of that inaptitude for attention, well known to us, which is\r\na peculiarity of the degenerate subject. The course of his ideas is\r\ndetermined, not by a central idea round which the will groups all other\r\nideas, suppressing some and strengthening others with the help of\r\nattention; but by the wholly mechanical association of ideas, awakened\r\nin the case of the Parnassians by a similar or identical verbal sound.\r\nHis poetical method is pure echolalia.\r\n\r\nThe Parnassian theory of the importance of form, notably of rhyme, for\r\npoetry, of the intrinsic value of beauty in the sound of words, of\r\nthe sensuous pleasure to be derived from sonorous syllables without\r\nregard to their sense, and of the uselessness, and even harmfulness, of\r\nthought in poetry, has become decisive in the most recent development\r\nof French poetry.[261] The Symbolists, whom we have studied in an\r\nearlier chapter, hold closely to this theory. These poor in spirit,\r\nwho only babble ‘sonorous syllables’ without sense, are the direct\r\ndescendants of the Parnassians.\r\n\r\nThe Parnassian theory of art is mere imbecility. But the ego-mania\r\nof the degenerate minds who have concocted it reveals itself in the\r\nenormous importance they attribute to their hunt for rhymes, to their\r\npuerile pursuit of words which are ‘tonitruants’ and ‘rayonnants.’\r\nCatulle Mendès ends a poem (_La seule Douceur_), where he describes in\r\nthe most fulsome manner a series of the pleasures of life, with this\r\nenvoi: ‘Prince, I lie. Beneath the Twins or the Urn (? Aquarius) to\r\nmake noble words rhyme together in one’s book, this is the sole joy of\r\nlife.’[262] He who is not of this opinion is simply said to forfeit his\r\nhumanity. Thus it is that Baudelaire calls Paris ‘a Capernaum, a Babel\r\npeopled by the imbecile and useless, not over-fastidious in their ways\r\nof killing time, and wholly inaccessible to literary pleasures.’[263]\r\nTo treat as imbecile those who look upon a senseless jumble of rhymes\r\nand a litany of so-called beautiful proper names as of no value, is\r\na stupid self-conceit at which one might well laugh. But Baudelaire\r\ngoes so far as to speak of the ‘useless.’ No one has a right to live\r\nwho is inaccessible to what he calls ‘literary pleasures’--that is, an\r\nidiotic echolalia! Because he cultivates the art of playing on words\r\nwith a puerile seriousness, everyone must place the same importance as\r\nhe does on his infantile amusements, and whoever does not do so is not\r\nsimply a Philistine or an inferior being, without susceptibility or\r\nrefinement--no, he is a ‘useless creature.’ If this simpleton had the\r\npower, he would no doubt wish to pursue his idea to the end and sweep\r\nthe ‘useless’ out of the ranks of the living, as Nero put to death\r\nthose who did not applaud his acting in the theatre. Can the monstrous\r\nego-mania of one demented be more audaciously expressed than in this\r\nremark of Baudelaire’s?\r\n\r\nThe second characteristic of the Parnassians, after their insane\r\nexaggeration of the value for humanity of the most external form for\r\npoetry and rhyming, is their ‘impassibility,’ or impassivity. They\r\nthemselves, of course, will not admit that this term is applicable\r\nto them. ‘Will they ever have done with this humbug!’ angrily cried\r\nLeconte de Lisle, when interrogated on the subject of ‘impassibility,’\r\nand Catulle Mendès says, ‘Because Glatigny has written a poem entitled\r\n_Impassible_, and because I myself wrote this line, the avowed pose in\r\nwhich is belied in the course of the poem,\r\n\r\n  ‘“Pas de sanglots humains dans le chant des poètes!”[264]\r\n\r\nit has been concluded that the Parnassians were or wished to be\r\n“impassive.” Where do they find it, where do they see it, this icy\r\nequanimity, this dryness which they have ascribed to us?’[265]\r\n\r\nCriticism, in sooth, has chosen its word badly. ‘Impassibility’ in\r\nart, in the sense of complete indifference to the drama of nature\r\nand of life, there cannot be. It is psychologically impossible.\r\nAll artistic activity, in so far as it is not the mere imitation\r\nof disciples, but flows from an original necessity, is a reaction\r\nof the artist upon received impressions. Those which leave him\r\ncompletely indifferent inspire the poet with no verse, the painter\r\nwith no picture, the musician with no tone composition. Impressions\r\nmust strike him in some way or other, they must awaken in him some\r\nemotion, in order that he may have the idea at all of giving them an\r\nobjective artistic form. In the infinite volume of phenomena flowing\r\nuniformly past his senses, the artist has distinguished the subject\r\nhe treats with the peculiar methods of his art; he has exercised a\r\nselective activity, and has given the preference to this subject over\r\nothers. This preference presupposes sympathy or antipathy; the artist,\r\ntherefore, must have felt something on perceiving his subject. The sole\r\nfact that an author has written a poem or a book testifies that the\r\nsubject treated of has inspired him with curiosity, interest, anger, an\r\nagreeable or disagreeable emotion, that it has compelled his mind to\r\ndwell upon it. This is, therefore, the contrary of indifference.\r\n\r\nThe Parnassians are not impassive. In their poems there is whimpering,\r\ncursing and blasphemy, and the utterance of joy, enthusiasm and sorrow.\r\nBut what tortures them or enchants them is exclusively their own\r\nstates, their own experiences. The only foundation of their poetry is\r\ntheir ‘Ego.’ The sorrow and joy of other men do not exist for them.\r\nTheir ‘impassibilité’ is, therefore, not impassivity, but rather a\r\ncomplete absence of sympathy. The ‘tower of ivory’ in which, according\r\nto the expression of one of them, the poet lives and proudly withdraws\r\nhimself from the indifferent mob, is a pretty name given to his\r\nobtuseness in regard to the being and doing of his fellow-creatures.\r\nAll this has been well discerned by that beneficently clear-minded\r\ncritic, M. Ferdinand Brunetière. ‘One of the worst consequences,’\r\nhe writes, ‘that they [the theories of the Parnassians, and, in\r\nparticular, those of Baudelaire] may involve, is, by isolating art,\r\nto isolate the artist as well, making him an idol to himself, and as\r\nit were enclosing him in the sanctuary of his “Ego.” Not only, then,\r\ndoes his work become a question merely concerned with himself--of\r\nhis griefs and his joys, his loves and his dreams--but, in order\r\nto develop himself in the direction of his aptitudes, there is no\r\nlonger anything which he respects or spares, there is nothing he will\r\nnot subordinate to himself; which is, to speak by the way, the true\r\ndefinition of immorality. To make one’s self the centre of things, from\r\na philosophical point of view, is as puerile an illusion as to see in\r\nman “the king of creation,” or in the earth what the ancients called\r\n“the navel of the world”; but, from the purely human point of view, it\r\nis the glorification of egoism, and, consequently, the negation itself\r\nof solidarity.’[266]\r\n\r\nThus Brunetière notices the ego-mania of the Parnassians, and affirms\r\ntheir anti-social principles, their immorality; he believes, however,\r\nthat they have freely chosen their point of view. This is his only\r\nerror. They are not ego-maniacs by free choice, but because they must\r\nbe, and cannot be otherwise. Their ego-mania is not a philosophy or a\r\nmoral doctrine; it is their malady.\r\n\r\nThe impassivity of the Parnassians is, as we have seen, a callousness\r\nwith regard, not to everything, but only to their fellow-creatures,\r\nunited to the tenderest love for themselves. But their ‘impassibility’\r\nhas yet another aspect, and those who have found the term have probably\r\nthought above all of this, without having given themselves a complete\r\naccount of it. The indifference which the Parnassians display, and\r\nof which they are particularly proud, applies less to the joys and\r\nsufferings of their fellow-creatures than to the universally recognised\r\nmoral law. For them there is neither virtue nor vice, but only the\r\nbeautiful and the ugly, the rare and the commonplace. They took their\r\npoint of view ‘beyond good and evil,’ long before the moral madness\r\nof Frederick Nietzsche found this formula. Baudelaire justifies it\r\nin the following terms: ‘Poetry ... has no other aim than itself; it\r\ncannot have any other, and no poem will be so great, so noble, so truly\r\nworthy of the name of poem, as that which will have been written only\r\nfor the pleasure of writing a poem. I do not wish to say--be it well\r\nunderstood--that poetry may not ennoble morals, that its final result\r\nmay not be to raise man above vulgar interests. This would evidently\r\nbe an absurdity. I say that, if the poet has pursued a moral aim he\r\nhas diminished his poetical power, and it is not imprudent to wager\r\nthat his work will be bad. Poetry cannot, under pain of death or\r\ndegradation, assimilate itself to science or morals. It has not truth\r\nfor its object, it has only itself.’ And Th. Gautier, who records this\r\nremark, wholly approves of it. ‘On the high summits he [the poet] is at\r\npeace: _pacem summa tenent_,’ he says,[267] in employing an image which\r\noccurs dozens of times in Nietzsche.\r\n\r\nLet us nail here first of all a current sophistical artifice employed\r\nby Baudelaire. The question to which he wishes to reply is this: Is\r\npoetry to be moral or not? Suddenly he smuggles science, with which it\r\nhas nothing to do, into his demonstration, names it in the same breath\r\nwith morality, shows triumphantly that science has nothing in common\r\nwith poetry, and then acts as though he had demonstrated the same thing\r\non the subject of morality. Now, it does not occur to any reasonable\r\nman of the present day to demand of poetry the teaching of scientific\r\ntruths, and for generations no serious poet has thought of treating\r\nof astronomy or physics in a didactic poem. The only question which\r\nsome minds would wish to consider as an open one is that of knowing if\r\nwe may, or may not, exact of poetry that it be moral, and it is this\r\nquestion that Baudelaire answers by an unproven affirmative, and by a\r\ncrafty shuffling.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to linger here on this question, not because it\r\nembarrasses me and I should like to avoid it, but because it seems to\r\nme more in place to discuss it when considering the disciples of the\r\n‘Parnassus,’ the ‘Décadents,’ and the Æsthetes, who have pushed the\r\ndoctrine to its extreme. I will for the present leave uncontradicted\r\nthe assertion of the Parnassians, that poetry has not to trouble itself\r\nabout morality. The poet ought to stand ‘beyond good and evil.’ But\r\nthat could only reasonably signify an absolute impartiality; it can\r\nonly amount to this--that the poet, in considering some action or\r\naspect, simply aspires to find himself confronted by a drama, which\r\nhe judges only for its beauty or ugliness, without even asking if it\r\nis moral or not. A poet of this kind must necessarily see, then, as\r\nmany beautiful as ugly things, as many moral as immoral. For, taking\r\nall in all, moral and beautiful things in humanity and Nature are at\r\nleast as frequent as the contrary, and must even preponderate. For we\r\nconsider as ugly, either what presents a deviation from laws which are\r\nfamiliar to us, and to which we have adapted ourselves, or that in\r\nwhich we recognise the manifestation of anything prejudicial to us; and\r\nwe regard as immoral all that is contrary to the prosperity, or even\r\nthe maintenance, of society. Now, the mere fact that we have looked to\r\nfind laws is a proof that phenomena corresponding to recognised laws,\r\nand consequently agreeable to us, must be far more numerous than the\r\nphenomena in contradiction to those laws, and therefore repulsive;\r\nand so, too, the maintenance of society is a proof that conservative\r\nand favourable, _i.e._, moral, forces must be more vigorous than\r\ndestructive, _i.e._, immoral, forces. Hence, in a poem which while it\r\ndid not trouble itself about morals, was nevertheless truly impartial,\r\nas it pretended to be, morality would be represented on a scale at\r\nleast as large as, and even somewhat larger than, immorality. But in\r\nthe poetry of the Parnassians this is not the case. It delights almost\r\nexclusively in depravity and ugliness. Théophile Gautier extols, in\r\n_Mademoiselle de Maupin_, the basest sensuality, which, if it should\r\nbecome the general rule, would carry humanity back to the condition\r\nof savages living in sexual promiscuousness without individual love,\r\nand without any family institutions whatever; Sainte-Beuve, in other\r\nrespects more romanticist than Parnassian, builds in his novel\r\n_Volupté_ an altar to sexual pleasure, at which the ancient Asiatic\r\nadorers of Ashtaroth could, without hesitation, have performed their\r\nworship; Catulle Mendès, who began his literary career by being\r\ncondemned for a moral outrage (brought upon himself by his play _Le\r\nRoman d’une Nuit_) exalts in his later works, of which I will not quote\r\nthe titles, one of the most abominable forms of unnatural license;\r\nBaudelaire sings of carrion, maladies, criminals and prostitutes;\r\nin short, if one contemplates the world in the mirror of Parnassian\r\npoetry, the impression received is that it is composed exclusively\r\nof vices, crimes and corruption without the smallest intermixture of\r\nhealthy emotions, joyous aspects of Nature and human beings feeling\r\nand acting honestly. In perpetual contradiction to himself, as becomes\r\na truly degenerate mind, the same Baudelaire, who in one place does\r\nnot wish poetry to be confounded with morality, says in another place:\r\n‘Modern art has an essentially devilish [_démoniaque_] tendency. And it\r\nseems that this infernal side of his nature, which man takes a pleasure\r\nin explaining to himself, increases daily, as if the devil amused\r\nhimself by magnifying it through artificial processes, in imitation\r\nof the poultry-farmers, patiently cramming the human species in his\r\nhen-yards to prepare for himself a more succulent nourishment.’[268]\r\n\r\nThere is no indifference here to virtue or vice; it is an absolute\r\npredilection for the latter, and aversion for the former. Parnassians\r\ndo not at all hold themselves ‘beyond good or evil,’ but plunge\r\nthemselves up to the neck in evil, and as far as possible from good.\r\nTheir feigned ‘impartiality’ with regard to the drama of morality or\r\nimmorality is in reality a passionate partisanship for the immoral and\r\nthe disgusting. It was wrong, therefore, to think of characterizing\r\nthem by ‘impassibility.’ Just as they lack feeling only towards their\r\nfellow-creatures, and not towards themselves, so they are only cold and\r\nindifferent towards good, not towards evil; the latter attracts them,\r\non the contrary, as forcibly, and fills them as much with feelings of\r\npleasure, as the good attracts and rejoices the sane majority of men.\r\n\r\nThis predilection for evil has been discerned by many observers, and\r\na good number have endeavoured to explain it philosophically. In a\r\nlecture on ‘Evil as the Object of Poetical Representation,’ Franz\r\nBrentano says:[269]\r\n\r\n‘Since what is presented in tragedy appears so little desirable and\r\ncheerful, it suggests the idea that these explanations (of the pleasure\r\nwe find in it) are less to be sought in the excellence of the subject\r\nthan in some peculiar need of the public, which finds a response alone\r\nin the things thus exhibited.... Can it be that man feels, from time\r\nto time, the need of a melancholy emotion, and longs for tragedy as\r\nfor something which satisfies this need in the most efficacious way,\r\nassisting him, so to speak, to weep heartily for once?... If for a\r\nlong time no passions, such as tragedies excite, have had sway in us,\r\nthe power to experience them demands anew, in some way, to manifest\r\nitself, and it is tragedy which comes to our aid; we feel the emotions\r\npainfully, it is true, but at the same time we experience a beneficial\r\nalleviation of our need. I think I have observed similar facts a\r\nhundred times--less in myself than in others, in those, for example,\r\nwho devour with avidity the newspaper report of the “latest murder.”’\r\n\r\nProfessor Brentano here confounds first of all, with a lamentable\r\nlevity, what is evil and what is saddening--two wholly different\r\nconcepts. The death of a beloved being, for example, is saddening,\r\nbut there is nothing evil in it, _i.e._, immoral, unless, by a subtle\r\nquibble, it is proposed to interpret as an immorality the action of\r\nnatural forces in the dissolution of the individual. Further, he gives\r\nas an explanation what is only a perfectly superficial paraphrase--Why\r\ndo we take pleasure in evil? Because ...we have evidently in us a\r\ntendency to take pleasure in evil! _Opium facit dormire quia est in\r\neo virtus dormitiva._ M. Fr. Paulhan has treated the question more\r\nseriously, but neither do we get very far with him. ‘A contemplative,\r\nbroad, inquisitive, penetrating mind,’ he says,[270] ‘with profound\r\nmoral tendencies, which can nevertheless sink into oblivion in great\r\npart during scientific research or æsthetic contemplation; sometimes\r\nalso with a slight natural perversion, or simply a marked tendency\r\ntowards certain pleasures, whatever they may be, which are not an evil\r\nin themselves, and may even be a good, but of which the abuse is an\r\nevil--such are the foundations of the sentiment (love of evil) which is\r\noccupying us. The idea of evil, by flattering a taste, finds a solid\r\npoint of support; and there is one reason more why it is agreeable--in\r\nthat it satisfies, ideally, an inclination which reason hinders from\r\nbeing satisfied really to satiety.’\r\n\r\nHere again is this sequence of ideas revolving in a circle, like a\r\ncat at play biting its tail: we have a taste for evil, because we\r\nfind a taste for evil. The intellectual ineptitude which M. Paulhan\r\nhere reveals is so much the more surprising in that, some pages\r\nabove, he came very near the true solution of the enigma. ‘There are\r\nmorbid states,’ he there says, ‘where the appetites are depraved; the\r\npatient eagerly swallows coal, earth, or things still worse. There\r\nare others in which the will is vitiated, and the character warped\r\nin some point. The pathological examples are striking, and the case\r\nof the Marquis de Sade is one of the most characteristic.... One\r\nsometimes finds enjoyment in the evils suffered by one’s self, just\r\nas in those of others. The sentiments of voluptuousness, sorrow and\r\npity, which psychology has studied, appear to betray sometimes a\r\nveritable perversion, and to contain as elements the love of sorrow\r\nfor sorrow itself.... Often one has to do with people who desire\r\ntheir own weal primarily, and then the woe of others. One or other of\r\nthese psychical states is visible in many cases of wickedness; for\r\nexample, in the fact of a rich manufacturer falsely accusing a young\r\nman, who is going to marry, of being affected by a venereal disease,\r\nand maintaining his assertion _for the pleasure_ of doing so ... or,\r\nagain, of a young villain who relishes the pleasure of theft to the\r\npoint of crying: “Even if I were rich, I should always like to steal.”\r\nEven the sight of physical suffering is not always disagreeable; many\r\npeople seek it.... This perversion is probably of all times and of all\r\ncountries.... It would seem that into the mind of a man of our times\r\nthere might enter a certain enjoyment in upsetting the order of nature,\r\nwhich does not appear to have been manifested before with a similar\r\nintensity. It is one of the thousand forms of recoiling on one’s self\r\nwhich characterizes our advanced civilization.’ Here M. Paulhan touches\r\nthe kernel of the question, without remarking it or being arrested\r\nby it. The love of evil is not a universally human attribute; it is\r\nan ‘aberration’ and a ‘perversion,’ and ‘one of the thousand forms\r\nof recoiling on one’s self,’ otherwise more briefly and more clearly\r\nexpressed as ego-mania.\r\n\r\nThe literature of penal legislation and mental therapeutics has\r\nregistered hundreds of cases of aberration in which the patient has\r\nfelt a passionate predilection for the evil and horrible, for sorrow\r\nand death. I should like to quote only one characteristic example: ‘In\r\nthe autumn of 1884 there died, in a Swiss prison, Marie Jeanneret, a\r\nmurderess. After having received a good education she devoted herself\r\nto the care of the sick, not for the love of doing good, but to\r\nsatisfy a mad passion. The sufferings, groans and distorted features\r\nof the sick filled her with secret voluptuousness. She implored the\r\ndoctors, on her knees and with tears, to allow her to assist in\r\ndangerous operations, in order to be able to gratify her cravings. The\r\ndeath-agony of a human being afforded her the height of enjoyment.\r\nUnder the pretext of a disease of the eyes, she had consulted several\r\noculists, and had obtained from them belladonna and other poisons. Her\r\nfirst victim, a woman, was her friend; others followed; the doctors,\r\nto whom she had recommended herself as nurse, having no suspicions,\r\nthe less so because she frequently changed her residence. An attempt\r\nfailing in Vienna led to discovery; she had poisoned not less than nine\r\npersons, but felt neither repentance nor shame. In prison her most\r\nardent wish was to fall dangerously ill, in order to satiate herself in\r\nthe looking-glass with the contortions of her own features.’[271]\r\n\r\nThus we recognise, in the light of clinical observation, the true\r\nnature of the Parnassians. Their impassivity, in so far as it\r\nis mere indifference to the sufferings of others, and to virtue\r\nand vice, proceeds from their ego-mania, and is a consequence of\r\ntheir obtuseness, which makes it impossible for them to receive a\r\nsufficiently keen presentation of the external world, hence also of\r\nsorrow, vice, or ugliness, so as to be able to respond by normal\r\nreactions, by aversion, indignation, or pity. But in cases where\r\nimpassivity constitutes a declared predilection for what is evil and\r\ndisgusting, we can see the same aberration which makes of the imbecile\r\na cruel torturer of animals,[272] and of Marie Jeanneret, cited above,\r\na tenfold poisoner. The whole difference consists in the degree of\r\nimpulsion. If it is strong enough, its consequences are heartless acts\r\nand crimes. If it is elaborated by diseased centres with insufficient\r\nforce, it can be satisfied by imagination alone, by poetic or artistic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nOf course there have been attempts made to defend aberration as\r\nsomething justified and voluntary, and even to erect it into an\r\nintellectual distinction. Thus it is that M. Paul Bourget[273] puts\r\ninto the mouth of the ‘Décadents,’ with little artifices of style which\r\ndo not permit a moment’s doubt that he is expressing his own opinion,\r\nthe following argument: ‘We delight in what you call our corruptions\r\nof style, and we delight at the same time the refined people of our\r\nrace and our time. It remains to be seen whether our exception is not\r\nan aristocracy, and whether, in the æsthetic order, the majority of\r\nsuffrages represents anything else than the majority of ignorances....\r\nIt is a self-deception not to have the courage of one’s intellectual\r\npleasure. Let us delight, therefore, in our singularities of ideal\r\nand of form, even if we must shut ourselves up in a solitude without\r\nvisitors.’\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely necessary to show that by these arguments, in which\r\nM. Bourget anticipates the whole delirious ‘philosophy’ of Nietzsche,\r\nevery crime can be glorified as an ‘aristocratic’ action. The assassin\r\nhas ‘the courage of his intellectual pleasure,’ the majority which does\r\nnot approve of him is a majority of the ‘ignorant,’ he delights in the\r\n‘singularity’ of his ‘ideal,’ and for this reason must at the most\r\nallow himself to be shut up in ‘a solitude without visitors,’ _i.e._,\r\nto speak plainly, in a reformatory, if ‘the majority of ignorances’\r\ndoes not have him hanged or guillotined. Has not the ‘Décadent’ Maurice\r\nBarrès defended and justified Chambige, a specimen of the murderer for\r\nlove of murder, with Bourget’s theory?\r\n\r\nThis same repulsive theorist of the most abandoned anti-social\r\nego-mania denies also that one can speak of a mind as diseased or\r\nhealthy. ‘There is,’ he says,[274] ‘from the metaphysical observer’s\r\npoint of view, neither disease nor health of the soul; there are only\r\npsychological states, for he perceives in our sufferings and in our\r\nfaculties, in our virtues and in our vices, in our volitions and in our\r\nrenunciations, only changing combinations, inevitable, and therefore\r\nnormal, subject to the known laws of the association of ideas. Only\r\nprejudice, in which the ancient doctrine of final causes and the belief\r\nin the definite aim of the universe reappear, can make us consider the\r\nloves of Daphnis and Chloë in the valley as natural and healthy, and\r\nthe loves of a Baudelaire as artificial and unwholesome.’\r\n\r\nTo bring this silly sophistry down to its just value, common-sense has\r\nonly to recollect the existence of lunatic asylums. But common-sense\r\nhas not the right of suffrage among the rhetoricians of M. Paul\r\nBourget’s stamp. We reply to him, then, with a seriousness he does\r\nnot merit, that in fact every vital manifestation, those of the brain\r\nas of any other organ, is the necessary and only possible effect\r\nof the causes which occasion them, but that, according to the state\r\nof the organ and of its elementary parts, its activity, necessary\r\nand natural as such, can be useful or hurtful to the whole organism.\r\nWhether the world has a purpose is a question that can altogether be\r\nleft indecisive, but the activity of each part of the organism has\r\nnevertheless, if not the aim, at least unquestionably the effect, of\r\npreserving the whole organism; if it does not produce this effect,\r\nand if, on the contrary, it thwarts it, it is injurious to the whole\r\norganism, and for such an injurious activity of any particular organ\r\nlanguage has coined the word ‘disease.’ The sophist who denies that\r\nthere may be disease and health must also logically deny that there\r\nmay be life and death, or, at least, that death may have some sort\r\nof importance. For, as a matter of fact, given a certain activity of\r\nits parts which we call morbid, the organism perishes, while with an\r\nactivity of another nature, which we qualify as healthy, it lives\r\nand thrives. As long, then, as Bourget does not lay down the dogma\r\nthat pain is as agreeable as pleasure, decrepitude as satisfactory as\r\nvigour, and death as desirable as life, he proves that he does not\r\nknow, or dares not draw from his premise, the just conclusion which\r\nwould immediately make the absurdity of it apparent.\r\n\r\nThe whole theory which must explain and justify the predilection for\r\nevil has, besides, been invented as an after-thought. The inclination\r\nfor what is evil and disgusting existed first, and was not a\r\nconsequence of philosophical considerations and self-persuasion. We\r\nhave here merely another case of that method of our consciousness, so\r\noften attested in the course of these inquiries, which consists of\r\ninventing rational causes for the instincts and acts of the unconscious.\r\n\r\nIn the predilection of the Parnassians for the immoral, criminal and\r\nugly, we have to deal merely with an organic aberration, and with\r\nnothing else. To pretend that inclinations of this kind exist in all\r\nmen, even in the best and sanest, and are merely stifled by him,\r\nwhile the Parnassians give the rein to theirs, is an arbitrary and\r\nunproved assertion. Observation and the whole march of the historical\r\ndevelopment of humanity contradict it.\r\n\r\nThere may be repulsion and attraction in nature--no one denies it. A\r\nglance at the magnetic poles, at the positive and negative electrodes,\r\nsuffices to establish this fact. We find this phenomenon again among\r\nthe lowest forms of life. Certain materials attract, others repel\r\nthem. There is no question here of an inclination or an expression of\r\nthe will. We must rather consider the process as purely mechanical,\r\nhaving its reason probably in molecular relations which are still\r\nunknown to us. Microbiology gives to the attitude of micro-organisms\r\ntowards attractive and repulsive matter the name of ‘chemotaxis’\r\nor chimiotaxia, invented by Pfeffer.[275] In higher organisms the\r\nconditions are naturally not so simple. Among them also, it is\r\ntrue, the ultimate cause of inclinations and aversions is certainly\r\nchimiotactic, but the effect of chimiotaxia must necessarily manifest\r\nitself under another form. A simple cell such as a bacillus, for\r\nexample, is repelled directly when it penetrates into the radius of a\r\nchimic body which repels it. But the cell constituting a portion of\r\na higher organism has not this liberty of movement. It cannot change\r\nits place independently. If it is now chimiotactically repelled, it\r\ncannot escape from the pernicious action, but must remain exposed to\r\nit, and submit to the disturbances in its vital activity. If these are\r\nsufficiently serious to injure the functions of the whole organism, the\r\nlatter obtains knowledge of it, endeavours to perceive their cause,\r\ndiscovers it also, as a general rule, and does for the suffering cell\r\nwhat the latter cannot do alone, namely, shields it from the repelling\r\naction. The organism necessarily acquires experience in its defence\r\nagainst pernicious influences. It learns to know the circumstances\r\nin which they appear, and no longer permits matters to reach the\r\nstage of the really chimiotactic effect, but for the most part evades\r\ndisturbing matters before they can exert a really direct repulsion. The\r\nknowledge acquired by the individual becomes hereditary, transforms\r\nitself into an organized faculty of the species, and the organism feels\r\nsubjectively, as a discomfort which may amount to pain, the warning\r\nthat a pernicious influence is acting upon it, and that it has to avoid\r\nit. To escape from pain becomes one principal function of the organism,\r\nwhich it cannot insufficiently provide against or neglect without\r\nexpiating that negligence by its ruin.\r\n\r\nIn the human being processes take place not otherwise than as they\r\nhave been here described. The hereditary organized experience of the\r\nspecies warns him of the noxiousness of influences to which he is\r\nfrequently exposed. His outposts against naturally hostile forces are\r\nhis senses. Taste and smell give him, as to repulsive chimiotactic\r\nmatter, the impressions of nausea and of stench; the different kinds of\r\nskin-sensations make him aware, through sensations of pain, heat, or\r\ncold, that a given contact is unfavourable to him; eye and ear place\r\nhim on his guard, by loud, shrill, discordant sensations, against\r\nthe mechanical effects of certain physical phenomena. Finally, the\r\nhigher cerebral centres respond to recognised noxious influences of\r\na composite nature, or to the representation of them by an equally\r\ncomposite reaction of aversion in different degrees of intensity, from\r\nsimple discomfort to horror, indignation, dismay, or fury.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle of this hereditary, organized, racial experience is the\r\nunconscious life; to it is confided defence against simple, frequently\r\nrecurring noxious influences. Nausea at intolerable tastes, repugnance\r\nto insufferable smells, the fear of dangerous animals, natural\r\nphenomena, etc., have become for it an instinct to which the organism\r\nabandons itself without reflection--_i.e._, without the intervention of\r\nconsciousness. But the human organism learns to distinguish and avoid\r\nnot only all that is directly prejudicial to itself; it acts in the\r\nsame way with regard to that which menaces it not as an individual, but\r\nas a racial being, as a member of an organized society; antipathy to\r\ninfluences injurious to the maintenance or prosperity of the society\r\nbecomes in him an instinct. But this enriching of organized unconscious\r\ncognition represents a higher degree of development than many human\r\nbeings attain to. The social instincts are those that a man acquires\r\nlast of all, and, in conformity to a known law, he loses them first\r\nwhen he retrogrades in his organic development.\r\n\r\nConsciousness has occasion to declare the dangerous nature of\r\nphenomena, and to defend the organism against it, only if these\r\nphenomena are either quite new, or very rare, so that they cannot be\r\nhereditarily recognised and dreaded; or if they enclose in themselves\r\nmany different elements, and do not act directly, but only by their\r\nmore or less remote consequences, so that to know them exacts a complex\r\nactivity of representation and judgment.\r\n\r\nThus aversion is always the instinctive, or conscious cognition of a\r\nnoxious influence. Pleasure, its opposite, is not merely, as has been\r\nsometimes maintained, the absence of discomfort--_i.e._, a negative\r\nstate--but something positive. Every part of the organism has definite\r\nneeds which assert themselves as a conscious or unconscious tendency,\r\nas an inclination or appetite; the satisfaction of these needs is felt\r\nas a pleasure which can rise to a feeling of bliss. The first need of\r\neach organ is to manifest itself in activity. Its simple activity is a\r\nsource of pleasure to it, so long as it does not go beyond its powers.\r\nThe activity of the cerebral centres consists in receiving impressions,\r\nand in transforming them into representations and movements. This\r\nactivity produces in them feelings of pleasure; they have in\r\nconsequence a strong desire to receive impressions so as to be put into\r\nactivity by them, and experience feelings of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis, broadly sketched, is the natural history of the feelings of\r\npleasure and pain. The reader who has mastered it will experience no\r\ndifficulty in comprehending the nature of aberration.\r\n\r\nUnconscious life is subject to the same biological laws as\r\nconscious life. The vehicle of the unconscious is the same nervous\r\ntissue--although, it may be, another portion of the system--in\r\nwhich consciousness is also elaborated. The unconscious is just as\r\nlittle infallible as consciousness. It can be more highly developed\r\nor retarded in its development; it can be more or less stupid or\r\nintelligent. If the unconscious is incompletely developed, it\r\ndistinguishes badly and judges falsely, it deceives itself in the\r\nknowledge of what is prejudicial or favourable to it, and instinct\r\nbecomes unreliable or obtuse. Then we get the phenomenon of\r\nindifference to what is ugly, loathsome, immoral.\r\n\r\nWe know that among the degenerate divers arrested developments and\r\nmalformations appear. Particular organs or entire systems of organs\r\nare arrested at a degree of development which corresponds to infancy,\r\nor even to the fœtal life. If the highest cerebral centres of the\r\ndegenerate stop in their development at a very low stage, they become\r\nimbeciles or idiots. If the arrest of development strikes the nervous\r\ncentres of unconscious life, the degenerate lose the instincts which,\r\nin normal beings, find expression in nausea and disgust at certain\r\nnoxious influences; I might say, their unconscious life suffers from\r\nimbecility or idiocy.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have seen in the preceding chapter that the impressionability\r\nof the nerves and brain in the degenerate subject is blunted. Hence he\r\nonly perceives strong impressions, and it is only these which excite\r\nhis cerebral centres to that intellectual and motor activity which\r\nproduces in them feelings of pleasure. Now, disagreeable impressions\r\nare naturally stronger than agreeable or indifferent impressions, for\r\nif they were not stronger we should not feel them as painful, and\r\nthey would not induce the organism to make efforts to defend itself.\r\nTo procure, then, the feelings of pleasure which are linked with the\r\nactivity of the cerebral centres, to satisfy the need of functioning\r\nwhich is peculiar to the cerebral centres as to all the other organs,\r\nthe degenerate person seeks impressions which are strong enough to\r\nexcite to activity his obtuse and inert centres. But such impressions\r\nare precisely those which the healthy man feels as painful or\r\nrepugnant. Thus, the aberrations or perversions of the degenerate find\r\nexplanation. They have a longing for strong impressions, because these\r\nonly can put their brains into activity, and this desired effect on\r\ntheir centres is only exercised by impressions that sane beings dread\r\nbecause of their violence, _i.e._, painful, repugnant and revolting\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nTo say that every human being has secretly a certain predilection\r\nfor the evil and the abominable is absurd: the only little spark of\r\ntruth contained in this foolish assertion is, that even the normal\r\nhuman being becomes obtuse when fatigued, or exhausted by illness;\r\n_i.e._, he falls into the state which, in the degenerate, is chronic.\r\nThen he presents naturally the same phenomena as we have attested\r\nin the case of the latter, although in a much lower degree. He may\r\nfind pleasure, then, in crime and ugliness, and in the former rather\r\nthan in the latter; for crimes are social injuries, while uglinesses\r\nare the visible form of forces unfavourable to the individual; but\r\nsocial instincts are feebler than the instincts of self-preservation.\r\nConsequently they are sooner put to sleep, and for this reason the\r\nrepulsion against crime disappears more quickly than that against\r\nugliness. In any case, this state is also an aberration in the normal\r\nbeing, but imputable to fatigue, and in him is not chronic, as in the\r\ndegenerate, nor does it amount to the hidden fundamental character of\r\nhis being, as the sophists who calumniate him pretend.\r\n\r\nAn uninterrupted line of development leads from the French romantic\r\nschool to the Parnassians, and all the germs of the aberrations which\r\nconfront us in full expansion among the latter can be distinguished\r\nin the former. We have seen in the preceding book how superficial and\r\npoor in ideas their poetry is, how they exalt their imagination above\r\nthe observation of reality, and what importance they assign to their\r\nworld of dreams. Sainte-Beuve, who at first joined their group, says\r\non this subject, with a complacency which proves he was not conscious\r\nof expressing any blame: ‘The Romance School ... had a thought, a\r\ncult, viz., love of art and passionate inquisitiveness for a vivid\r\nexpression, a new turn, a choice image, a brilliant rhyme: they wished\r\nfor every one of their frames a peg of gold. [A remarkably false\r\nimage, let it be said in passing. A rich frame may be desired for a\r\npicture, but as to the nail which supports it, regard will be had to\r\nits solidity and not to its preciousness.] Children if you will, but\r\nchildren of the Muses, who never sacrifice to ordinary grace [_grâce\r\nvulgaire_].’[276]\r\n\r\nLet us hold this admission firmly, that the romantic writers were\r\nchildren; they were so in their inaptitude to comprehend the world\r\nand men, in the seriousness and zeal with which they gave themselves\r\nup to their game of rhymes, in the artlessness with which they placed\r\nthemselves above the precepts of morality and good sense in use among\r\nadults. Let us exaggerate this childishness a little (without allying\r\nwith it the wild and exuberant imagination of a Victor Hugo, and his\r\ngift of lightning-like rapidity of association, evoking the most\r\nstartling antitheses), and we obtain the literary figure of Théophile\r\nGautier, whom the imbecile Barbey d’Aurevilly could name in the same\r\nbreath with Goethe,[277] evidently for the sole reason that the sound\r\nof the great German poet’s name in French pronunciation has a certain\r\nresemblance to that of Gautier, but of whom one of his admirers, M.\r\nJ. K. Huysmans, says:[278] ‘Des Esseintes [the hero of his novel]\r\nbecame gradually indifferent to Gautier’s work; his admiration for that\r\nincomparable painter had gone on diminishing from day to day, and now\r\nhe was more astonished than delighted by his indifferent descriptions.\r\nThe impression left by the objects was fixed on his keenly observant\r\neye, but it was localized there, and had not penetrated further into\r\nhis brain and flesh [?]; like a monstrous reflector, he was constantly\r\nlimited to reverberate his environment with an impersonal distinctness.’\r\n\r\nWhen M. Huysmans regards Gautier as an impersonal mirror of reality,\r\nhe is the victim of an optical illusion. In verse as in prose, Gautier\r\nis a mechanical worker, who threads one line of glittering adjectives\r\nafter another, without designing anything particular. His descriptions\r\nnever give a clear outline of the object he wishes to depict. They\r\nrecall some crude mosaic of the later Byzantine decadence, the\r\ndifferent stones of which are lapis-lazuli, malachite, chrysoprase and\r\njasper, and which yield, for this reason, an impression of barbarous\r\nsplendour, while scarcely any design is discernible. In his ego-mania,\r\nlacking all sympathy with the external world, he does not suspect what\r\nsorrows and joys its drama encloses, and just as he feels nothing in\r\nthe prospect before him, so neither can he awaken in the reader emotion\r\nof any sort by his listless and affected attempts to render it. The\r\nonly emotions of which he is capable, apart from his arrogance and\r\nvanity, are those connected with sex; hence, in his works we merely\r\nfind alternations between glacial coldness and lubricity.\r\n\r\nIf we exaggerate Théophile Gautier’s worship of form and\r\nlasciviousness, and if to his indifference towards the world and\r\nmen we associate the aberration which caused it to degenerate into\r\na predilection for the bad and the loathsome, we have before us the\r\nfigure of Baudelaire. We must stop there awhile, for Baudelaire\r\nis--even more than Gautier--the intellectual chief and model of the\r\nParnassians, and his influence dominates the present generation of\r\nFrench poets and authors, and a portion also of English poets and\r\nauthors, to an omnipotent degree.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to demonstrate at length that Baudelaire was a\r\ndegenerate subject. He died of general paralysis, after he had wallowed\r\nfor months in the lowest depths of insanity. But even if no such\r\nhorrible end had protected the diagnosis from all attack, there would\r\nbe no doubt as to its accuracy, seeing that Baudelaire showed all the\r\nmental stigmata of degeneration during the whole of his life. He was\r\nat once a mystic and an erotomaniac,[279] an eater of hashish and\r\nopium;[280] he felt himself attracted in the characteristic fashion by\r\nother degenerate minds, mad or depraved, and appreciated, for example,\r\nabove all authors, the gifted but mentally-deranged Edgar Poe, and\r\nthe opium-eater Thomas de Quincey. He translated Poe’s tales, and\r\ndevoted to them an enthusiastic biography and critique, while from\r\nthe _Confessions of an Opium-Eater_, by De Quincey, he compiled an\r\nexhaustive selection, to which he wrote extravagant annotations.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of Baudelaire’s mind are revealed to us in the\r\ncollection of his poems, to which he has given a title betraying at\r\nonce his self-knowledge and his cynicism: _Les Fleurs du Mal_--‘The\r\nFlowers of Evil.’ The collection is not complete. There lack some\r\npieces which only circulate in manuscript, because they are too\r\ninfamous to bear the full publicity of a marketable book. I will take\r\nmy quotations, however, from the printed verses only, which are quite\r\nsufficient to characterize their author.\r\n\r\nBaudelaire hates life and movement. In the piece entitled _Les Hiboux_,\r\nhe shows us his owls sitting in a row, motionless, under the black\r\nyews, and continues:\r\n\r\n  ‘Leur attitude au sage enseigne\r\n  Qu’il faut en ce monde qu’il craigne\r\n  Le tumulte et le mouvement.\r\n\r\n  L’homme ivre d’une ombre qui passe\r\n  Porte toujours le châtiment\r\n  D’avoir voulu changer de place.’\r\n\r\nBeauty says of herself, in the piece of that name:\r\n\r\n  ‘Je hais le mouvement qui déplace les lignes;\r\n  Et jamais je ne pleure et jamais je ne ris.’\r\n\r\nHe abhors the natural as much as he loves the artificial. Thus he\r\ndepicts his ideal world (_Rêve Parisien_):\r\n\r\n  ‘De ce terrible paysage\r\n  Que jamais œil mortel ne vit,\r\n  Ce matin encore l’image,\r\n  Vague et lointaine, me ravit....\r\n\r\n  ‘J’avais banni de ces spectacles\r\n  Le végétal irrégulier....\r\n\r\n  ‘Je savourais dans mon tableau\r\n  L’enivrante [!] monotonie\r\n  Du métal, du marbre et de l’eau.\r\n\r\n  ‘Babel d’escaliers et d’arcades\r\n  C’était un palais infini,\r\n  Plein de bassins et de cascades\r\n  Tombant dans l’or mat ou bruni;\r\n\r\n  ‘Et des cataractes pesantes,\r\n  Comme des rideaux de cristal,\r\n  Se suspendaient, éblouissantes,\r\n  A des murailles de métal.\r\n\r\n  ‘Non d’arbres, mais de colonnades\r\n  Les étangs dormants s’entouraient,\r\n  Où de gigantesques naïades,\r\n  Comme des femmes, se miraient.\r\n\r\n  ‘Des nappes d’eau s’épanchaient, bleues,\r\n  Entre des quais roses et verts,\r\n  Pendant des millions de lieues,\r\n  Vers les confins de l’univers;\r\n\r\n  ‘C’étaient des pierres inouïes\r\n  Et des flots magiques; c’étaient\r\n  D’immenses glaces éblouies\r\n  Par tout ce qu’elles reflétaient.\r\n\r\n  ‘Et tout, même la couleur noire,\r\n  Semblait fourbi, clair, irisé....\r\n\r\n  ‘Nul astre d’ailleurs, nuls vestiges\r\n  De soleil, même au bas du ciel,\r\n  Pour illuminer ces prodiges,\r\n  Qui brillaient d’un feu personnel (!)\r\n\r\n  ‘Et sur ces mouvantes merveilles\r\n  Planait (terrible nouveauté!\r\n  Tout pour l’œil, rien pour les oreilles!)\r\n  Un silence d’eternité.’\r\n\r\nSuch is the world he represents to himself, and which fills him with\r\nenthusiasm: not an ‘irregular’ plant, no sun, no stars, no movement,\r\nno noise, nothing but metal and glass, _i.e._, something like a tin\r\nlandscape from Nuremberg, only larger and of more costly material,\r\na plaything for the child of an American millionaire suffering from\r\nthe wealth-madness of parvenus, with a little electric lamp in the\r\ninterior, and a mechanism which slowly turns the glass cascades,\r\nand makes the glass sheet of water slide. Such must necessarily be\r\nthe aspect of the ego-maniac’s ideal world. Nature leaves him cold\r\nor repels him, because he neither perceives nor comprehends her;\r\nhence, where the sane man sees the picture of the external world,\r\nthe ego-maniac is surrounded by a dark void in which, at most,\r\nuncomprehended nebulous forms are hovering. To escape the horror of\r\nthem he projects, as from a magic-lantern, coloured shadows of the\r\nimages which fill his consciousness; but these representations are\r\nrigid, inert, uniform and infantile, like the morbid and weak cerebral\r\ncentres by which they are elaborated.\r\n\r\nThe incapacity of the ego-maniac to feel aright external impressions,\r\nand the toil with which his brain works, are also the key of the\r\nfrightful tedium of which Baudelaire complains, and of the profound\r\npessimism with which he contemplates the world and life. Let us hear\r\nhim in _Le Voyage_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Nous avons vu partout...\r\n  Le spectacle ennuyeux de l’immortel péché:\r\n\r\n  ‘La femme, esclave vile, orgueilleuse et stupide,\r\n  Sans rire s’adorant et s’aimant sans dégôut;\r\n  L’homme, tyran goulu, paillard, dur et cupide,\r\n  Esclave de l’esclave et ruisseau dans l’égout;\r\n\r\n  ‘Le bourreau qui jouit, le martyr qui sanglote;\r\n  La fête qu’assaisonne et parfume le sang;...\r\n\r\n  ‘Et les moins sots, hardis amants de la démence,\r\n  Fuyant le grand troupeau parqué par le Destin,\r\n  Et se réfugiant dans l’opium immense [!].\r\n  --Tel est du globe entier l’éternel bulletin...\r\n\r\n  ‘O Mort, vieux capitaine, il est temps! levons l’ancre!\r\n  Ce pays nous ennuie, O Mort! Appareillons!\r\n\r\n  ‘Nous voulons...\r\n  Plonger au fond du gouffre, Enfer ou Ciel, qu’importe?\r\n  Au fond de l’Inconnu pour trouver du nouveau!’\r\n\r\nThis desperate cry towards the ‘new’ is the natural complaint of a\r\nbrain which longs to feel the pleasures of action, and greedily craves\r\na stimulation which his powerless sensory nerves cannot give him. Let a\r\nsane man imagine the state of mind into which he would fall if he were\r\nimprisoned in a cell where no ray of light, no noise, no scent from the\r\nouter world would reach him. He would then have an accurate idea of\r\nthe chronic state of mind in the ego-maniac, eternally isolated by the\r\nimperfection of his nervous system from the universe, from its joyous\r\nsounds, from its changing scenes and from its captivating movement.\r\nBaudelaire cannot but suffer terribly from ennui, for his mind really\r\nlearns nothing new and amusing, and is forced constantly to indulge in\r\nthe contemplation of his ailing and whimpering self.\r\n\r\nThe only pictures which fill the world of his thought are sombre,\r\nwrathful and detestable. He says (_Un Mort joyeux_):\r\n\r\n  ‘Dans une terre grasse et pleine d’escargots\r\n  Je veux creuser moi-même une fosse profonde\r\n  Où je puisse à loisir étaler mes vieux os\r\n  Et dormir dans l’oubli comme un requin dans l’onde...\r\n  Plutôt que d’implorer une larme du monde\r\n  Vivant, j’aimerais mieux inviter les corbeaux\r\n  A saigner tous les bouts de ma carcasse immonde.\r\n\r\n  ‘O vers! noir compagnons sans oreille et sans yeux,\r\n  Voyez venir à vous un mort libre et joyeux!’\r\n\r\nIn _La Cloche fêlée_, he says of himself:\r\n\r\n  ‘... Mon âme est fêlée, et lorsqu’en ses ennuis\r\n  Elle veut de ses chants peupler l’air froid des nuits\r\n  Il arrive souvent que sa voix affaiblie\r\n\r\n  Semble le râle épais d’un blessé qu’on oublie\r\n  Au bord d’un lac de sang, sous un grand tas de morts.’\r\n\r\n_Spleen_:\r\n\r\n        ‘...on triste cerveau...\r\n  C’est.. un immense caveau\r\n  Qui contient plus de morts que la fosse commune.\r\n  --Je suis un cimetière abhorré de la lune\r\n  Où, comme des remords, se traînent de longs vers....’\r\n\r\n_Horreur sympathique_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Cieux déchirés comme des grèves,\r\n  En vous se mire mon orgueil!\r\n  Vos vastes nuages en deuil.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sont les corbillards de mes rêves,\r\n  Et vos lueurs sont le reflet,\r\n  De l’Enfer où mon cœur se plaît!’\r\n\r\n_Le Coucher du Soleil romantique_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Une odeur de tombeau dans les ténèbres nage,\r\n  Et mon pied peureux froisse, au bord du marécage,\r\n  Des crapauds imprévus et de froids limaçons.’\r\n\r\n_Dance macabre_: The poet speaking to a skeleton:\r\n\r\n  ‘Aucuns t’appelleront une caricature,\r\n  Qui ne comprennent pas, amants ivres de chair,\r\n  L’élégance sans nom de l’humaine armature.\r\n  Tu réponds, grand squelette, à mon goût le plus cher!...’\r\n\r\n_Une Charogne_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Rappelez-vous l’objet que nous vîmes, mon âme,\r\n    Ce beau matin d’été si doux:\r\n  Au détour d’un sentier une charogne infâme\r\n    Sur un lit semé de cailloux,\r\n\r\n  ‘Les jambes en l’air, comme une femme lubrique\r\n    Brûlante et suant les poisons,\r\n  Ouvrait d’une façon nonchalante et cynique\r\n    Son ventre plein d’exhalaisons....\r\n\r\n  ‘Et le ciel regardait la carcasse superbe [!]\r\n    Comme une fleur s’épanouir.\r\n  La puanteur était si forte, que sur l’herbe\r\n    Vous crûtes vous évanouir....\r\n\r\n  ‘Et pourtant vous serez semblable à cette ordure,\r\n    A cette horrible infection,\r\n  Étoile de mes yeux, soleil de ma nature,\r\n    Vous, mon ange et ma passion!\r\n\r\n  ‘Oui! telle vous serez, ô la reine des grâces,\r\n    Après les derniers sacrements,\r\n  Quand vous irez, sous l’herbe et les floraisons grasses,\r\n    Moisir parmi les ossements....’\r\n\r\nThat which pleases Baudelaire most are these pictures of death and\r\ncorruption which I could quote in still greater numbers if I did not\r\nthink that these examples sufficed. However, next to the frightful\r\nand the loathsome it is the morbid, the criminal and the lewd, which\r\npossess the strongest attraction for him.\r\n\r\n_Le Rêve d’un Curieux_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Connais-tu, comme moi, la douleur savoureuse?...’\r\n\r\n_Spleen_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Mon chat sur le carreau cherchant une litière\r\n  Agite sans repos son corps maigre et galeux....’\r\n\r\n_Le Vin du Solitaire_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Un baiser libertin de la maigre Adeline....’\r\n\r\n_Le Crépuscule du Soir_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Voici le soir charmant, ami du criminel; ...\r\n  Et l’homme impatient se change en bête fauve....’\r\n\r\n_La Destruction_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Sans cesse à mes côtés s’agite le Démon....\r\n  Je l’avale et le sens qui brûle mon poumon\r\n  Et l’emplit d’un désir éternel et coupable....\r\n\r\n  ‘Il me conduit....\r\n  Haletant et brisé de fatigue, au milieu\r\n  Des plaines de l’Ennui, profondes et désertes,\r\n\r\n  ‘Et jette dans mes yeux....\r\n  Des vêtements souillés, des blessures ouvertes,\r\n  Et l’appareil sanglant de la Destruction!’\r\n\r\nIn _Une Martyre_ he describes complacently and in detail a bedroom in\r\nwhich a young, presumably pretty courtesan has been murdered; the\r\nassassin had cut off her head and carried it away. The poet is only\r\ncurious to know one thing:\r\n\r\n  ‘L’homme vindicatif que tu n’as pu, vivante,\r\n    Malgré tant d’amour, assouvir,\r\n  Combla-t-il sur ta chair inerte et complaisante\r\n    L’immensité de son désir?’\r\n\r\n_Femmes damnées_, a piece dedicated to the worst aberration of\r\ndegenerate women, terminates with this ecstatic apostrophe to the\r\nheroines of unnatural vice:\r\n\r\n  ‘O vierges, ô démons, ô monstres, ô martyres,\r\n  De la réalité grands esprits contempteurs,\r\n  Chercheuses d’infini, dévotes et satyres,\r\n  Tantôt pleines de cris, tantôt pleines de pleurs,\r\n\r\n  Vous que dans votre enfer mon âme a poursuivies,\r\n  Pauvres sœurs, je vous aime autant que je vous plains....’\r\n\r\n_Préface_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l’incendie,\r\n  N’ont pas encore brodé de leurs plaisants dessins\r\n  Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins,\r\n  C’est que notre âme, hélas! n’est pas assez hardie....’\r\n\r\nBut if he is not bold enough to commit crimes himself, he does not\r\nleave a moment’s doubt that he loves them, and much prefers them to\r\nvirtue, just as he prefers the ‘end of autumns, winters, springs\r\nsteeped in mud,’ to the fine season of the year (_Brumes et Pluies_).\r\nHe is ‘hostile to the universe rather than indifferent’ (_Les sept\r\nVieillards_). The sight of pain leaves him cold, and if tears are shed\r\nbefore him they only evoke in his mind the image of a landscape with\r\nrunning waters.\r\n\r\n_Madrigal triste_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Que m’importe que tu sois sage?\r\n  Sois belle! et sois triste! Les pleurs\r\n  Ajoutent un charme au visage,\r\n  Comme le fleuve au paysage.’\r\n\r\nIn the struggle between _Abel et Caïn_ he takes the part of the latter\r\nwithout hesitation:\r\n\r\n  ‘Race d’Abel, dors, bois et mange;\r\n  Dieu te sourit complaisamment.\r\n\r\n  ‘Race de Caïn, dans la fange\r\n  Rampe et meurs misérablement.\r\n\r\n  ‘Race d’Abel, ton sacrifice\r\n  Flatte le nez du Séraphin.\r\n\r\n  ‘Race de Caïn, ton supplice\r\n  Aura-t-il jamais une fin?\r\n\r\n  ‘Race d’Abel, vois tes semailles\r\n  Et ton bétail venir à bien;\r\n\r\n  ‘Race de Caïn, tes entrailles\r\n  Hurlent la faim comme un vieux chien.\r\n\r\n  ‘Race d’Abel, chauffe ton ventre\r\n  A ton foyer patriarchal;\r\n\r\n  ‘Race de Caïn, dans ton antre\r\n  Tremble de froid, pauvre chacal!\r\n\r\n  ‘Ah! race d’Abel, ta charogne\r\n  Engraissera le sol fumant!\r\n\r\n  ‘Race de Caïn, ta besogne\r\n  N’est pas faite suffisamment.\r\n\r\n  ‘Race d’Abel, voici ta honte:\r\n  Le fer est vaincu par l’épieu! [?]\r\n\r\n  ‘Race de Caïn, au ciel monte\r\n  Et sur la terre jette Dieu!’\r\n\r\nIf he prays it is to the devil (_Les Litanies de Satan_):\r\n\r\n  ‘Gloire et louange à toi, Satan, dans les hauteurs\r\n  Du Ciel, où tu régnas, et dans les profondeurs\r\n  De l’Enfer, où, vaincu, tu rêves en silence!\r\n  Fais que mon âme un jour, sous l’Arbre de Science,\r\n  Près de toi se repose....’\r\n\r\nHere there mingles with the aberration that mysticism which is never\r\nwanting in the degenerate. Naturally, the love of evil can only take\r\nthe form of devil-worship, or diabolism, if the subject is a believer,\r\nif the supernatural is held to be a real thing. Only he who is rooted\r\nwith all his feelings in religious faith will, if he suffers from\r\nmoral aberration, seek bliss in the adoration of Satan, in impassioned\r\nblasphemy of God and the Saviour, in the violation of the symbols of\r\nfaith, or will wish to incite unnatural voluptuousness by mortal sin\r\nand infernal damnation, though humouring it in the _messe noire_, in\r\nthe presence of a really consecrated priest, and in a hideous travesty\r\nof all the forms of the liturgy.\r\n\r\nBesides the devil, Baudelaire adores only one other power, viz.,\r\nvoluptuousness. He prays thus to it (_La Prière d’un Païen_):\r\n\r\n  ‘Ah! ne ralentis pas tes flammes!\r\n  Réchauffe mon cœur engourdi,\r\n  Volupté, torture des âmes!...\r\n  Volupté, sois toujours ma reine!’\r\n\r\nTo complete the portrait of this mind, let us cite two more of his\r\npeculiarities. He suffers first from images of perpetual anguish, as\r\nhis piece testifies (_Le Gouffre_), which is valuable as a confession:\r\n\r\n  ‘... Tout est abîme,--action, désir, rêve,\r\n  Parole! et sur mon poil qui tout droit se relève\r\n  Mainte fois de la peur je sens passer le vent.\r\n\r\n  ‘En haut, en bas, partout, la profondeur, la grève,\r\n  Le silence, l’espace affreux et captivant...\r\n  Sur le fonde de mes nuits, Dieu, de son doigt savant,\r\n  Dessine un cauchemar multiforme et sans trêve.\r\n\r\n  ‘J’ai peur du sommeil comme on a peur d’un grand trou,\r\n  Tout plein de vague horreur, menant on ne sait où;\r\n  Je ne vois qu’infini par toutes les fenêtres,\r\n\r\n  ‘Et mon esprit, toujours du vertige hanté,\r\n  Jalouse du néant l’insensibilité.’\r\n\r\nBaudelaire describes here accurately enough that obsession of\r\ndegenerates which is called ‘fear of abysses’ (cremnophobia).[281]\r\nHis second peculiarity is his interest in scents. He is attentive to\r\nthem, interprets them; they provoke in him all kinds of sensations\r\nand associations. He expresses himself thus on this subject in\r\n_Correspondances_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Les parfums, les couleurs, et les sons se répondent.\r\n\r\n  ‘Il est des parfums frais comme des chairs d’enfants,\r\n  Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies,\r\n  --Et d’autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants,\r\n\r\n  ‘Ayant l’expansion des choses infinies,\r\n  Comme l’ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l’encens,\r\n  Qui chantent les transports de l’esprit et des sens.’\r\n\r\nHe loves woman through his sense of smell ... (‘Le parfum de tes\r\ncharmes étranges,’ _A une Malabaraise_), and never fails, in describing\r\na mistress, to mention her exhalations.\r\n\r\n_Parfum exotique_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Quand les deux yeux fermés, en un soir chaud d’automne,\r\n  Je respire l’odeur de ton sein chaleureux,\r\n  Je vois se dérouler des rivages heureux\r\n  Qu’eblouissent les feux d’un soleil monotone.’\r\n\r\n_La Chevelure_:\r\n\r\n  ‘O toison, moutonnant jusque sur l’encolure!\r\n  O boucles! O parfum chargé de nonchaloir!...\r\n\r\n  ‘La langoureuse Asie et la brûlante Afrique,\r\n  Tout un monde lointain, absent, presque défunt,\r\n  Vit dans tes profondeurs, forêt aromatique!’\r\n\r\nNaturally, instead of good odours, he prefers the perfumes which affect\r\nthe healthy man as stinks. Putrefaction, decomposition and pestilence\r\ncharm his nose.\r\n\r\n_Le Flacon_:\r\n\r\n  ‘Il est de forts parfums pour qui toute matière\r\n  Est poreuse. On dirait qu’ils pénètrent le verre...\r\n  Parfois on trouve un vieux flacon qui se souvient,\r\n  D’où jaillit toute vive une âme qui revient.\r\n\r\n  ‘Voilà le souvenir enivrant qui voltige\r\n  Dans l’air troublé; les yeux se ferment; le vertige\r\n  Saisit l’âme vaincue et la pousse à deux mains\r\n  Vers un gouffre obscurci de miasmes humains;\r\n\r\n  ‘Il la terrasse au bord d’un gouffre séculaire,\r\n  Où, Lazare odorant déchirant son suaire,\r\n  Se meut dans son réveil le cadavre spectral\r\n  D’un vieil amour ranci, charmant et sepulcral.\r\n\r\n  ‘Ainsi, quand je serai perdu dans la memoire\r\n  Des hommes, dans le coin d’une sinistre armoire\r\n  Quand on m’aura jeté, vieux flacon désolé,\r\n  Décrépit, poudreux, sale, abject, visqueux, fêlé,\r\n\r\n  ‘Je serai ton cercueil, aimable pestilence!\r\n  Le témoin de ta force et de ta virulence,\r\n  Cher poison préparé par les anges!...’\r\n\r\nWe now know all the features which compose Baudelaire’s character.\r\nHe has the ‘cult of self’;[282] he abhors nature, movement and life;\r\nhe dreams of an ideal of immobility, of eternal silence, of symmetry\r\nand artificiality; he loves disease, ugliness and crime; all his\r\ninclinations, in profound aberration, are opposed to those of sane\r\nbeings; what charms his sense of smell is the odour of corruption;\r\nhis eye, the sight of carrion, suppurating wounds and the pain of\r\nothers; he feels happy in muddy, cloudy, autumn weather; his senses\r\nare excited by unnatural pleasures only. He complains of frightful\r\ntedium and of feelings of anguish; his mind is filled with sombre\r\nideas, the association of his ideas works exclusively with sad or\r\nloathsome images; the only thing which can distract or interest him\r\nis badness--murder, blood, lewdness and falsehood. He addresses his\r\nprayers to Satan, and aspires to hell.\r\n\r\nHe has attempted to make his peculiarities pass for a comedy and\r\na studied pose. In a note placed at the head of the first edition\r\n(1857) of the _Fleurs du Mal_, he says: ‘Among the following pieces,\r\nthe most characteristic ... has been considered, at least by men of\r\nintellect, only for what it really is: the imitation of the arguments\r\nof ignorance and fury. Faithful to his painful programme, the author\r\nhas had, like a good comedian, to fashion his mind to all sophisms,\r\nas to all corruptions. This candid declaration will, doubtless, not\r\nprevent honest critics from ranking him among the theologians of the\r\npeople,’ etc. Some of his admirers accept this explanation or appear to\r\naccept it. ‘His intense disdain of the vulgar,’ murmurs Paul Bourget,\r\n‘breaks out in extremes of paradox, in laborious mystification....\r\nAmong many readers, even the keenest, the fear of being duped by this\r\ngrand disdainer hinders full admiration.’[283] The term has become\r\na commonplace of criticism for Baudelaire; he is a ‘mystificateur’;\r\neverything for him is only a deception; he himself neither feels nor\r\nbelieves anything he expresses in his poetry. It is twaddle, and\r\nnothing else. A rhetorician of the Paul Bourget sort, threshing straw,\r\nand curling scraps of paper, may believe that an inwardly free man is\r\ncapable of preserving artificially, all his life long, the attitude of\r\na galley-slave or a madman, well knowing he is only acting a comedy.\r\nThe expert knows that the choice of an attitude, such as Baudelaire’s,\r\nis a proof in itself of deep-seated cerebral disturbance.\r\n\r\nMental therapeutics has declared that persons who simulate insanity\r\nwith some perseverance, even with a rational object, as, for example,\r\nin the case of certain criminals on their trial, in order to escape\r\npunishment, are almost without exception really mad,[284] although\r\nnot to the degree they try to represent, just as the inclination to\r\naccuse one’s self, or to boast, of imaginary crimes is a recognised\r\nsymptom of hysteria. The assertion of Baudelaire himself, that his\r\nSatanism is only a studied _rôle_, has no sort of value whatever. As\r\nis so frequently the case among the ‘higher degenerates,’ he feels in\r\nhis heart that his aberrations are morbid, immoral and anti-social,\r\nand that all decent persons would despise him or take pity on him,\r\nif they were convinced that he was really what he boasts of being in\r\nhis poems; he has recourse, consequently, to the childish excuse that\r\nmalefactors also often have on their lips, viz., ‘that it was not\r\nmeant seriously.’ Perhaps also Baudelaire’s consciousness experienced\r\na sincere horror of the perverse instincts of his unconscious life,\r\nand he sought to make himself believe that with his Satanism he was\r\nlaughing at the Philistines. But such a tardy palliation does not\r\ndeceive the psychologist, and is of no importance for his judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDECADENTS AND ÆSTHETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS on the death of Alexander the Great his generals fell on the\r\nconqueror’s empire, and each one seized a portion of land, so did the\r\nimitators that Baudelaire numbered among his contemporaries and the\r\ngeneration following--many even without waiting for his madness and\r\ndeath--take possession of some one of his peculiarities for literary\r\nexploitation. The school of Baudelaire reflects the character of its\r\nmaster, strangely distorted; it has become in some sort like a prism,\r\nwhich diffracts this light into its elementary rays. His delusion\r\nof anxiety (anxiomania), and his predilection for disease, death\r\nand putrefaction (necrophilia), have fallen, as we have seen in the\r\npreceding book, to the lot of M. Maurice Rollinat. M. Catulle Mendès\r\nhas inherited his sexual aberrations and lasciviousness, and besides\r\nall the newer French pornographists rely upon them for proving the\r\n‘artistic raison d’être’ of their depravity. Jean Richepin, in _La\r\nChanson des Gueux_, has spied in him, and copied, his glorification\r\nof crime, and, further, in _Les Blasphèmes_, has swelled Baudelaire’s\r\nimprecations and prayers to the devil to the size of a fat volume,\r\nin a most dreary and wearisome manner. His mysticism suckles the\r\nSymbolists, who, after his example, pretend to perceive mysterious\r\nrelations between colours and the sensations of the other senses, with\r\nthis difference, that they hear colours while he smelt them; or, if\r\nyou will, they have an eye in their ear, while he saw with the nose.\r\nIn Paul Verlaine we meet again his mixture of sensuality and pietism.\r\nSwinburne has established an English depot for his Sadism, compounded\r\nof lewdness and cruelty, for his mysticism and for his pleasure in\r\ncrime, and I greatly fear that Giosué Carducci himself, otherwise so\r\nrichly gifted and original, must have turned his eyes towards the\r\n_Litanies de Satan_, when he wrote his celebrated _Ode à Satan_.\r\n\r\nThe diabolism of Baudelaire has been specially cultivated by Villiers\r\nde l’Isle-Adam and Barbey d’Aurevilly. These two men have, in addition\r\nto the general family likeness of the degenerate, a series of special\r\nfeatures in common. Villiers and Barbey attributed to themselves, as\r\nthe deranged frequently do, a fabulous genealogy; the former aspired\r\nto be a descendant of Count de l’Isle-Adam, the celebrated Marshal\r\nand Grand-Master of Malta (who as such could not be married, be it\r\nunderstood!), and he claimed one day, in a letter addressed to the\r\nQueen of England, the surrender of Malta in virtue of his right of\r\nheritage. Barbey annexed the aristocratic surname of d’Aurevilly, and\r\nduring the whole of his life spoke of his noble race--which had no\r\nexistence. Both made a theatrical display of fanatical Catholicism, but\r\nrevelled at the same time in studied blasphemies against God.[285] Both\r\ndelighted in eccentricities of costume and modes of life, and Barbey\r\nhad the habit of graphomaniacs, which we know already, of writing his\r\nletters and his literary works with different coloured inks. Villiers\r\nde l’Isle-Adam, and still more Barbey d’Aurevilly, created a class\r\nof poetry to the worship of the devil, which recalls the craziest\r\ndepositions of witches of the Middle Ages when put to the torture.\r\nBarbey especially may be said to have gone, in this respect, to the\r\nlimits of the imaginable. His book _Le Prêtre marié_ might be written\r\nby a contemporary of witch-burners; but it is surpassed in its turn by\r\n_Les Diaboliques_, a collection of crack-brained histories, where men\r\nand women wallow in the most hideous license, continually invoking the\r\ndevil, extolling and serving him. All the invention in these ravings\r\nBarbey stole with utter shamelessness from the books of the Marquis\r\nde Sade, without a shade of shame; that which belongs properly to him\r\nis the colouring of Catholic theology he gives to his profligacies.\r\nIf I only speak in general terms of the books mentioned here, without\r\nentering into details, without summarizing the contents, or quoting\r\ncharacteristic passages, it is because my demonstrations do not require\r\na plunge into this filth, and it is sufficient to point the finger from\r\nafar at the sink of vice which testifies to Baudelaire’s influence on\r\nhis contemporaries.\r\n\r\nBarbey, the imitator of Baudelaire, has himself found an imitator in\r\nM. Joséphin Péladan, whose first novel, _Vice suprême_, occupies an\r\neminent place in the literature of diabolism. M. Péladan, who had not\r\nyet promoted himself to the dignity of a first-class Assyrian king,\r\nparaphrases in his book what he means by ‘_vice suprême_’: ‘Let us\r\ndeny Satan! Sorcery has always sorcerers ... superior minds which have\r\nno need of conjuring-book, their thought being a page written by hell\r\nfor hell. Instead of the kid they have killed the good soul within\r\nthem, and are going to the Sabbath of the Word.’ [May the reader not\r\nstumble over obscurities! What were Péladan if he were not mystical?]\r\n‘They assemble to profane and soil the idea. Existing vice does not\r\nsatisfy them; they invent, they rival each other in seeking for, _new\r\nevil_, and if they find it they applaud each other. Which is worst, the\r\nSabbath-orgies of the body or those of the mind, of criminal action\r\nor of perverted thought? To reason, justify, to apotheosize evil, to\r\nestablish its ritual, to show the excellence of it--is this not worse\r\nthan to commit it? To adore the demon, or love evil, the abstract or\r\nthe concrete term of one and the same fact. There is blindness in the\r\ngratification of instinct, and madness in the perpetration of misdeeds;\r\nbut to conceive and theorize exacts a calm operation of the mind which\r\nis the _vice suprême_.’[286]\r\n\r\nBaudelaire has expressed this much more concisely in one single verse:\r\n‘_La conscience dans le Mal_’ (‘consciousness in evil’).[287]\r\n\r\nThe same Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, who has copied his diabolism from\r\nBaudelaire, has appropriated the predilection of the latter for the\r\nartificial, and has raised it to a funny pitch in his novel _L’Ève\r\nfuture_. In this half-fantastic half-satirical and wholly mad book,\r\nhe imagines, as the next development of humanity, a state in which\r\nthe woman of flesh and blood will be abolished, and be replaced by a\r\nmachine to which he allows (which is a little contradictory) the shape\r\nof a woman’s body, and which it will be sufficient with the help of\r\na screw so to dispose, in order to obtain from it at once whatever\r\nhappens to be desired: love, caprices, infidelity, devotion, every\r\nperversion and every vice. This is in sooth even more artificial than\r\nBaudelaire’s tin and glass landscape!\r\n\r\nA later disciple, M. Joris Karl Huysmans, is more instructive than\r\nall those imitators of Baudelaire who have only developed the one or\r\nthe other side of him. He has undertaken the toilsome task of putting\r\ntogether, from all the isolated traits which are found dispersed\r\nin Baudelaire’s poems and prose writings, a human figure, and of\r\npresenting to us Baudelairism incarnate and living, thinking and\r\nacting. The book in which he shows us his model ‘Decadent’ is entitled\r\n_A Rebours_ (‘Against the Grain’).\r\n\r\nThe word ‘décadent’ was borrowed by the French critics, in the fifties,\r\nfrom the history of the declining Roman Empire, to characterize the\r\nstyle of Théophile Gautier, and notably of Baudelaire. At the present\r\ntime the disciples of these two writers, and of their previous\r\nimitators, claim it as a title of honour. Otherwise than with the\r\nexpressions ‘pre-Raphaelites’ and ‘Symbolists,’ we possess an exact\r\nexplanation of the sense which those who speak of ‘decadence’ and\r\n‘decadents’ attach to these words.\r\n\r\n‘The style of decadence,’ says Théophile Gautier,[288] ‘... is nothing\r\nelse than art arrived at that extreme point of maturity produced by\r\nthose civilizations which are growing old with their oblique suns[!]--a\r\nstyle that is ingenious, complicated, learned, full of shades of\r\nmeaning and research, always pushing further the limits of language,\r\nborrowing from all the technical vocabularies, taking colours from\r\nall palettes, notes from all keyboards, forcing itself to express in\r\nthought that which is most ineffable, and in form the vaguest and\r\nmost fleeting contours; listening, that it may translate them, to the\r\nsubtle confidences of the neuropath, to the avowals of ageing and\r\ndepraved passion, and to the singular hallucinations of the fixed idea\r\nverging on madness. This style of decadence is the last effort of the\r\nWord (_Verbe_), called upon to express everything, and pushed to the\r\nutmost extremity. We may remind ourselves, in connection with it,\r\nof the language of the Later Roman Empire, already mottled with the\r\ngreenness of decomposition, and, as it were, gamy (_faisandée_), and of\r\nthe complicated refinements of the Byzantine school, the last form of\r\nGreek art fallen into deliquescence. Such is the inevitable and fatal\r\nidiom of peoples and civilizations where factitious life has replaced\r\nthe natural life, and developed in man unknown wants. Besides, it is no\r\neasy matter, this style despised of pedants, for it expresses new ideas\r\nwith new forms and words that have not yet been heard. In opposition\r\nto the classic style, it admits of shading, and these shadows teem\r\nand swarm with the larvæ of superstitions, the haggard phantoms of\r\ninsomnia, nocturnal terrors, remorse which starts and turns back at the\r\nslightest noise, monstrous dreams stayed only by impotence, obscure\r\nphantasies at which the daylight would stand amazed, and all that the\r\nsoul conceals of the dark, the unformed, and the vaguely horrible, in\r\nits deepest and furthest recesses.’\r\n\r\nThe same ideas that Gautier approximately expresses in this rigmarole,\r\nBaudelaire enumerates in these terms: ‘Does it not seem to the reader,\r\nas it does to me, that the language of the later Latin decadence--the\r\ndeparting sigh of a robust person already transformed and prepared for\r\nthe spiritual life--is singularly appropriate to express passion as it\r\nhas been understood and felt by the modern poetic world? Mysticism is\r\nthe opposite pole of that magnet in which Catullus and his followers,\r\nbrutal and purely epidermic poets, have only recognised the pole of\r\nsensuality. In this marvellous language, solecism and barbarism appear\r\nto me to convey the forced negligences of a passion which forgets\r\nitself and mocks at rules. Words, received in a new acceptation,\r\ndisplay the charming awkwardness of the Northern barbarian kneeling\r\nbefore the Roman beauty. Even a play on words, when it enters into\r\nthese pedantic stammerings, does it not display the wild and bizarre\r\ngrace of infancy?’[289]\r\n\r\nThe reader, who has the chapter on the psychology of mysticism present\r\nto his mind, naturally at once recognises what is hidden behind the\r\nword-wash of Gautier and Baudelaire. Their description of the state of\r\nmind which the ‘decadent’ language is supposed to express is simply a\r\ndescription of the disposition of the mystically degenerate mind, with\r\nits shifting nebulous ideas, its fleeting formless shadowy thought,\r\nits perversions and aberrations, its tribulations and impulsions.\r\nTo express this state of mind, a new and unheard-of language must\r\nin fact be found, since there cannot be in any customary language\r\ndesignations corresponding to presentations which in reality do not\r\nexist. It is absolutely arbitrary to seek for an example and a model\r\nof ‘decadent’ expression in the language of the Later Roman Empire. It\r\nwould be difficult for Gautier to discover in any writer whatever of\r\nthe fourth or fifth century the ‘mottled greenness of decomposition\r\nand, as it were, gamy’ Latin which so greatly charms him. M. Huysmans,\r\nmonstrously exaggerating Gautier’s and Baudelaire’s idea, as is the way\r\nwith imitators, gives the following description of this supposed Latin\r\nof the fifth century: ‘The Latin tongue, ... now hung [!], completely\r\nrotten, ... losing its members, dropping suppurations, scarcely\r\npreserving, in the total decay of its body, some firm parts which the\r\nChristians detached in order to pickle them in the brine of their new\r\nlanguage.’[290]\r\n\r\nThis debauch in pathological and nauseous ideas of a deranged mind with\r\ngustatory perversion is a delirium, and has no foundation whatever in\r\nphilological facts. The Latin of the later period of decadence was\r\ncoarse and full of errors, in consequence of the increasing barbarity\r\nin the manners and taste of the readers, the narrow-mindedness and\r\ngrammatical ignorance of the writers, and the intrusion of barbarous\r\nelements into its vocabulary. But it was very far from expressing ‘new\r\nideas with new forms’ and from taking ‘colours from all palettes’;\r\nit surprises us, on the contrary, by its awkwardness in rendering\r\nthe most simple thoughts, and by its profound impoverishment. The\r\nGerman language has also had a similar period of decadence. After\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War, even the best writers, a Moscherosch, a\r\nZinkgref, a Schupp, were ‘often almost incomprehensible’ with ‘their\r\nlong-winded and involved periods,’ and ‘their deportment as distorted\r\nas it was stiff’;[291] the grammar displayed the worst deformities,\r\nthe vocabulary swarmed with strange intruders, but the German of\r\nthose desolate decades was surely not ‘decadent’ in the sense of\r\nGautier’s, Baudelaire’s and Huysmans’ definitions. The truth is, that\r\nthese degenerate writers have arbitrarily attributed their own state\r\nof mind to the authors of the Roman and Byzantine decadence, to a\r\nPetronius, but especially to a Commodianus of Gaza, an Ausonius, a\r\nPrudentius, a Sidonius Apollinaris, etc., and have created in their\r\nown image, or according to their morbid instincts, an ‘ideal man of\r\nthe Roman decadence,’ just as Rousseau invented the ideal savage and\r\nChateaubriand the ideal Indian, and have transported him by their own\r\nimagination into a fabulous past or into a distant country. M. Paul\r\nBourget is more honest when he refrains from fraudulently quoting the\r\nLatin authors of the Latin decline, and thus describes the ‘decadence,’\r\nindependently of his Parnassian masters: ‘The word “decadence” denotes\r\na state of society which produces too great a number of individuals\r\nunfit for the labours of common life. A society ought to be assimilated\r\nto an organism. As an organism, in fact, it resolves itself into a\r\nfederation of lesser organisms, which again resolve themselves into\r\na federation of cells. The individual is the social cell. In order\r\nthat the whole organism should function with energy, it is necessary\r\nthat the component organisms should function with energy, but with a\r\nsubordinate energy. And in order that these inferior organisms should\r\nthemselves function with energy, it is necessary that their component\r\ncells should function with energy, but with a subordinate energy. If\r\nthe energy of the cells becomes independent, the organisms composing\r\nthe total organism cease likewise to subordinate their energy to\r\nthe total energy, and the anarchy which takes place constitutes the\r\ndecadence of the whole.’[292]\r\n\r\nVery true. A society in decadence ‘produces too great a number of\r\nindividuals unfit for the labours of common life’; these individuals\r\nare precisely the degenerate; ‘they cease to subordinate their energy\r\nto the total energy,’ because they are ego-maniacs, and their stunted\r\ndevelopment has not attained to the height at which an individual\r\nreaches his moral and intellectual junction with the totality, and\r\ntheir ego-mania makes the degenerate necessarily anarchists, _i.e._,\r\nenemies of all institutions which they do not understand, and to\r\nwhich they cannot adapt themselves. It is very characteristic that\r\nM. Bourget, who sees all this, who recognises that ‘decadent’ is\r\nsynonymous with inaptitude for regular functions and subordination\r\nto social aims, and that the consequence of decadence is anarchy and\r\nthe ruin of the community, does not the less justify and admire the\r\ndecadents, especially Baudelaire. This is ‘la conscience dans le mal’\r\nof which his master speaks.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the ideal ‘decadent’ that Huysmans draws so\r\ncomplacently and in such detail for us, in _A Rebours_. First, a word\r\non the author of this instructive book. Huysmans, the classical type of\r\nthe hysterical mind without originality, who is the predestined victim\r\nof every suggestion, began his literary career as a fanatical imitator\r\nof Zola, and produced, in this first period of his development,\r\nromances and novels in which (as in _Marthe_) he greatly surpassed\r\nhis model in obscenity. Then he swerved from naturalism, by an\r\nabrupt change of disposition, which is no less genuinely hysterical,\r\noverwhelmed this tendency and Zola himself with the most violent\r\nabuse, and began to ape the Diabolists, particularly Baudelaire. A red\r\nthread unites both of his otherwise abruptly contrasted methods, viz.,\r\nhis lubricity. That has remained the same. He is, as a languishing\r\n‘Decadent,’ quite as vulgarly obscene as when he was a bestial\r\n‘Naturalist.’\r\n\r\n_A Rebours_ can scarcely be called a novel, and Huysmans, in fact,\r\ndoes not call it so. It does not reveal a history, it has no action,\r\nbut presents itself as a sort of portrayal or biography of a man whose\r\nhabits, sympathies and antipathies, and ideas on all possible subjects,\r\nspecially on art and literature, are related to us in great detail.\r\nThis man is called Des Esseintes, and is the last scion of an ancient\r\nFrench ducal title.\r\n\r\nThe Duke Jean des Esseintes is physically an anæmic and nervous man\r\nof weak constitution, the inheritor of all the vices and all the\r\ndegeneracies of an exhausted race. ‘For two centuries the Des Esseintes\r\nhad married their children to each other, consuming their remnant of\r\nvigour in consanguineous unions.... The predominance of lymph in the\r\nblood appeared.’ (This employment of technical expressions and empty\r\nphrases, scientific in sound, is peculiar to many modern degenerate\r\nauthors and to their imitators. They sow these words and expressions\r\naround them, as the ‘learned valet’ of a well-known German farce\r\nscatters around him his scraps of French, but without being more\r\ncognizant of science than the latter was of the French language.) Des\r\nEsseintes was educated by the Jesuits, lost his parents early in life,\r\nsquandered the greater part of his patrimony in foolish carousing\r\nwhich overwhelmed him with ennui, and soon retired from society, which\r\nhad become insupportable. ‘His contempt for humanity increased; he\r\nunderstood at last that the world is composed for the most part of\r\nbullies and imbeciles. He had certainly no hope of discovering in\r\nothers the same aspirations and the same hatreds, no hope of uniting\r\nhimself with a kindred spirit delighting in a diligent decrepitude [!]\r\nas he did. Enervated, moody, exasperated by the inanity of interchanged\r\nand accepted ideas, he became like a person aching all over, till at\r\nlast he was constantly excoriating his epidermis, and suffering from\r\nthe patriotic and social nonsense which was dealt out each morning in\r\nthe newspapers.... He dreamed of a refined Thebaid, of a comfortable\r\ndesert, a warm and unmoving ark, where he would take refuge far from\r\nthe incessant flood of human stupidity.’\r\n\r\nHe realizes this dream. He sells his possessions, buys Government stock\r\nwith the ruins of his fortune, draws in this way an annual income of\r\nfifty thousand francs, buys himself a house which stands alone on a\r\nhill at some distance from a small village near Paris, and arranges it\r\naccording to his own taste.\r\n\r\n‘The artificial appeared to Des Esseintes as the distinguishing mark\r\nof human genius. As he expressed it, the day of nature is past: by the\r\ndisgusting uniformity of its landscapes and skies, it has positively\r\nexhausted the attentive patience of refined spirits. In sooth, what\r\nplatitude of a specialist who sees no further than his own line!\r\nwhat pettiness of a tradeswoman keeping this or that article to the\r\nexclusion of every other! what a monotonous stock of meadows and trees!\r\nwhat a commonplace agency for mountains and seas!’ (p. 31).\r\n\r\nHe banishes, in consequence, all that is natural from his horizon, and\r\nsurrounds himself by all that is artificial. He sleeps during the day,\r\nand only leaves his bed towards evening, in order to pass the night in\r\nreading and musing in his brightly-lit ground-floor. He never crosses\r\nthe threshold of his house, but remains within his four walls. He will\r\nsee no one, and even the old couple who wait on him must do their work\r\nwhile he is asleep, so as not to be seen by him. He receives neither\r\nletters nor papers, knows nothing of the outer world. He never has\r\nan appetite, and when by chance this is aroused, ‘he dips his roast\r\nmeat, covered with some extraordinary butter, into a cup of tea [oh,\r\nthe devil!], a faultless mixture of Si-a-Fayun, Mo-yu-tan and Khansky,\r\nyellow teas brought from China and Russia by special caravans’ (p. 61).\r\n\r\nHis dining-room ‘resembled a ship’s cabin,’ with ‘its little French\r\nwindow opening in the wainscot like a port-hole.’ It was built within a\r\nlarger room pierced by two windows, one of which was exactly opposite\r\nthe port-hole in the wainscot. A large aquarium occupied the whole\r\nspace between the port-hole and this window. In order, then, to give\r\nlight to the cabin, the daylight had to pass through the window, the\r\npanes of which had been replaced by plate glass, and then through the\r\nwater. ‘Sometimes, in the afternoon, when by chance Des Esseintes was\r\nawake and up, he set in motion the play of the pipes and conduits which\r\nemptied the aquarium and filled it afresh with pure water, introducing\r\ninto it drops of coloured essences, thus producing for himself at\r\npleasure the green or muddy yellow, opalescent or silver, tones of a\r\nreal river, according to the colour of the sky, the greater or less\r\nheat of the sun, the more or less decided indications of rain; in a\r\nword, according to the season and the weather. He would then imagine\r\nhimself to be between-decks on a brig, and contemplated with curiosity\r\nmarvellous mechanical fish, constructed with clock-work, which passed\r\nbefore the window of the port-hole, and clung to the sham weeds, or\r\nelse, while breathing the smell of the tar with which the room had been\r\nfilled before he entered, he examined the coloured engravings hung on\r\nthe walls representing steamers sailing for Valparaiso and La Plata,\r\nsuch as are seen at steamship agencies, and at Lloyd’s’ (p. 27).\r\n\r\nThese mechanical fish are decidedly more remarkable than Baudelaire’s\r\nlandscapes in tin. But this dream of an ironmonger, retired from\r\nbusiness and become an idiot, was not the only pleasure of the Duc\r\ndes Esseintes, who despised so deeply the ‘stupidity and vulgarity of\r\nmen,’ although, of all his acquaintance, probably not one would have\r\nstooped to ideas so asinine as these mechanical fish with clock-work\r\nmovements. When he wishes to do himself a particularly good turn,\r\nhe composes and plays a gustatory symphony. He has had a cupboard\r\nconstructed containing a series of little liqueur barrels. The taps of\r\nall the barrels could be opened or shut simultaneously by an engine\r\nset in motion by pressure on a knob in the wainscot, and under every\r\ntap stood an ‘imperceptible’ goblet, into which, on the turning of the\r\ncock, a drop fell. Des Esseintes called this liquor-cupboard his ‘mouth\r\norgan.’ (Notice all these ridiculous complications to mix a variety of\r\nliqueurs! As if it required all this deeply thought out mechanism!)\r\n‘The organ was then open. The stops labelled “flute, horn, voix\r\ncéleste,” were drawn out ready for action. Des Esseintes drank a drop\r\nhere and there, played internal symphonies, and succeeded in procuring\r\nin the throat sensations analogous to those that music offers to the\r\near. Each liqueur corresponded in taste, according to him, to the\r\nsound of an instrument. Dry curaçoa, for example, to the clarionet,\r\nthe tone of which is acescent and velvety; kümmel brandy to the oboë,\r\nwith its sonorous nasal sound; mint and anisette to the flute, which\r\nis at the same time sugary and peppery, squeaking and sweet; while, to\r\ncomplete the orchestra, kirsch rages with the blast of a trumpet; gin\r\nand whisky scarify the palate with their shrill outbursts of cornets\r\nand trombones; liqueur-brandy fulminates with the deafening crash of\r\nthe tuba; while Chios-raki and mastic roll on to the mucous membrane\r\nlike the thunder-claps of cymbals and kettledrums struck with the\r\narm!’ Thus he plays ‘string quartettes under the vault of his palate,\r\nrepresenting with the violin old eau-de-vie, smoky and subtle, sharp\r\nand delicate; with the tenor simulated by strong rum;’ with vespetro\r\nas violoncello, and bitters as double bass; green chartreuse was the\r\nmajor, and benedictine the minor key,’ etc. (p. 63).\r\n\r\nDes Esseintes does not only hear the music of the liqueurs: he sniffs\r\nalso the colour of perfumes. As he has a mouth organ, he possesses a\r\nnasal picture-gallery, _i.e._, a large collection of flasks containing\r\nall possible odorous substances. When his taste-symphonies no longer\r\ngive him pleasure, he plays an olfactory tune. ‘Seated in his\r\ndressing-room before his table ... a little fever disturbed him, he\r\nwas ready for work.... With his vaporizers he injected into the room\r\nan essence formed of ambrosia, Mitcham lavender, sweet peas, ess.\r\nbouquet, an essence which, when it is distilled by an artist, deserves\r\nthe name by which it is known, viz., “extract of flowery meadow.”\r\nThen, in this meadow, he introduced an exact fusion of tuberose, of\r\norange and almond flower, and forthwith artificially-created lilacs\r\nsprang up, while limes winnowed each other, pouring down upon the earth\r\ntheir pale emanations. Into this decoration, laid on in broad outlines\r\n... he blew ... a light rain of human and quasi-feline essences,\r\nsavouring of skirts, and indicating the powdered and painted woman,\r\nthe stephanotis, ayapana, opoponax, cypress, champak, and sarcanthus:\r\non which he juxtaposed a suspicion of syringa, in order to instil into\r\nthe factitious atmosphere which emanated from them a natural bloom of\r\nlaughter bathed in sweat (!!), and of joys which riot boisterously in\r\nfull sunshine’ (pp. 154-157).\r\n\r\nWe have seen how slavishly M. Huysmans, in his drivel about tea,\r\nliqueurs and perfumes, follows to the letter the fundamental principle\r\nof the Parnassians--of ransacking technical dictionaries. He has\r\nevidently been forced to copy the catalogues of commercial travellers\r\ndealing in perfumes and soaps, teas and liqueurs, to scrape together\r\nhis erudition in current prices.\r\n\r\nThat Des Esseintes should be made ill by this mode of life is not\r\nsurprising. His stomach rejects all forms of food, and this renders\r\nthe highest triumph of his love for the artificial possible: he is\r\nobliged to be nourished by means of peptonized injections, hence, in a\r\nway, diametrically opposed to nature.\r\n\r\nNot to be too prolix, I omit many details, _e.g._, an endless\r\ndescription of tones associated with colours (pp. 17-20); of orchids\r\nwhich he loves, because they have for him the appearance of eruptions,\r\nscars, scabs, ulcers and cancers, and seem covered with dressings,\r\nplastered with black mercurial axunge, green belladonna unguents (p.\r\n120 _et seq._); an exposition of the mystical aspect of precious and\r\nhalf-precious stones (pp. 57-60), etc. We will only acquaint ourselves\r\nwith a few more peculiarities of taste in this decadent type:\r\n\r\n‘The wild spirit, the rough, careless talent of Goya captivated him;\r\nbut the universal admiration which Goya’s works had gained deterred\r\nhim somewhat, and for many years he had ceased having them framed....\r\nIndeed, if the finest tune in the world becomes vulgar, insupportable,\r\nas soon as the public hum it and barrel-organs seize upon it, the\r\nwork of art to which false artists are not indifferent, which is not\r\ndisputed by fools, which is not content with stirring up the enthusiasm\r\nof some, even it becomes, by this very means, for the initiated\r\npolluted, commonplace and almost repulsive’ (p. 134).\r\n\r\nThe reference to barrel-organs is a trick calculated to mislead the\r\ninattentive reader. If a beautiful tune becomes insupportable as\r\nplayed on barrel-organs, it is because the organs are false, noisy and\r\nexpressionless, _i.e._, they modify the very essence of the tune and\r\ndrag it down to vulgarity; but the admiration of the greatest fool\r\nhimself changes absolutely nothing in a work of art, and those who have\r\nloved it for its qualities will again find all these qualities complete\r\nand intact, even when the looks of millions of impassive Philistines\r\nhave crawled over it. The truth is, the decadent, bursting with silly\r\nvanity, here betrays involuntarily his inmost self. The fellow has not,\r\nin fact, the smallest comprehension of art, and is wholly inaccessible\r\nto the beautiful as to all external impressions. To know if a work of\r\nart pleases him or not, he does not look at the work of art--oh no!\r\nhe turns his back and anxiously studies the demeanour of the people\r\nstanding before it. Are they enthusiastic, the decadent despises the\r\nwork; do they remain indifferent, or even appear displeased, he admires\r\nit with full conviction. The ordinary man always seeks to think, to\r\nfeel, and to do the same as the multitude; the decadent seeks exactly\r\nthe contrary. Both derive the manner of seeing and feeling, not from\r\ntheir internal convictions, but from what the crowd dictate to them.\r\nBoth lack all individuality, and they are obliged to have their eyes\r\nconstantly fixed on the crowd to find their way. The decadent is,\r\ntherefore, an ordinary man with a _minus_ sign, who, equally with the\r\nlatter, only in a contrary sense, follows in the wake of the crowd,\r\nand meanwhile makes things far more difficult for himself than the\r\nordinary man; he is also constantly in a state of irritation, while\r\nthe latter as constantly enjoys himself. This can be summed up in one\r\nproposition--the decadent snob is an anti-social Philistine, suffering\r\nfrom a mania for contradiction, without the smallest feeling for the\r\nwork of art itself.\r\n\r\nDes Esseintes reads occasionally between his gustatory and olfactory\r\n_séances_. The only works which please him are naturally those of the\r\nmost extreme Parnassians and Symbolists. For he finds in them (p. 266)\r\n‘the death-struggle of the old language, after it had become ever\r\nmouldier from century to century, was ending in dissolution, and in\r\nthe attainment of that deliquescence of the Latin language which gave\r\nup the ghost in the mysterious concepts and enigmatical expressions of\r\nSt. Boniface and St. Adhelm. Moreover, the decomposition of the French\r\nlanguage had set in all at once. In the Latin language there was a long\r\ntransition, a lapse of 400 years, between the speckled and beautiful\r\nspeech of Claudian and Rutilius, and the gamy speech of the eighth\r\ncentury. In the French language no lapse of time, no succession in\r\nage, had taken place; the speckled (_tacheté_) and superb style of the\r\nbrothers De Goncourt and the gamy style of Verlaine and Mallarmé rubbed\r\nelbows in Paris, existing at the same time and in the same century.’\r\n\r\nWe now know the taste of a typical decadent in all directions. Let us\r\ncast another glance at his character, morals, sentiments and political\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nHe has a friend, D’Aigurande, who one day thinks of marrying. ‘Arguing\r\nfrom the fact that D’Aigurande possessed no fortune, and that the dowry\r\nof his wife was almost nothing, he (Des Esseintes) perceived in this\r\nsimple desire an infinite perspective of ridiculous misfortunes.’ In\r\nconsequence (!) he encouraged his friend to commit this folly, and what\r\nhad to happen did happen: the young couple lacked money, everything\r\nbecame a subject for altercations and quarrels; in short, the life of\r\nboth became insupportable. He amused himself out of doors; she ‘sought\r\nby the expedients of adultery to forget her rainy and dull life.’ By\r\ncommon consent they cancelled their contract and demanded a legal\r\nseparation. ‘My plan of battle was exact, Des Esseintes then said to\r\nhimself, experiencing the satisfaction of those strategists who see\r\ntheir long-foreseen manœuvres succeeding.’\r\n\r\nAnother time, in the Rue de Rivoli, he comes upon a boy of about\r\nsixteen years old, a ‘pale, cunning-looking’ child, smoking a bad\r\ncigarette, and who asks him for a light. Des Esseintes offers him\r\nTurkish aromatic cigarettes, enters into conversation with him, learns\r\nthat his mother is dead, that his father beats him, and that he works\r\nfor a cardboard-box maker. ‘Des Esseintes listened thoughtfully. “Come\r\nand drink,” said he, and led him into a café, where he made him drink\r\nsome very strong punch. The child drank in silence. “Come,” said Des\r\nEsseintes suddenly, “do you feel inclined for some amusement this\r\nevening? I will treat you.”’ And he leads the unfortunate boy into a\r\ndisorderly house, where his youth and nervousness astonish the girls.\r\nWhile one of these women draws the boy away, the landlady asks Des\r\nEsseintes what was his idea in bringing them such an imp. The decadent\r\nanswers (p. 95): ‘I am simply trying to train an assassin. This boy\r\nis innocent, and has reached the age when the blood grows hot; he\r\nmight run after the girls in his quarter, remain honest while amusing\r\nhimself.... Bringing him here, on the contrary, into the midst of a\r\nluxury of which he had no conception, and which will engrave itself\r\nforcibly on his memory, in offering him every fortnight such an\r\nunexpected treat, he will get accustomed to these pleasures from which\r\nhis means debar him. Let us admit that it will require three months\r\nfor them to become absolutely necessary to him.... Well, at the end of\r\nthree months I discontinue the little _rente_ which I am going to pay\r\nyou in advance for this good action, and then he will steal in order to\r\nlive here.... He will kill, I hope, the good gentleman who will appear\r\ninopportunely while he is attempting to break open his writing-table.\r\nThen my aim will be attained; I shall have contributed, to the extent\r\nof my resources, in creating a villain, one more enemy of that hideous\r\nsociety which fleeces us.’ And he leaves the poor defiled boy on this\r\nfirst evening with these words: ‘Return as quickly as possible to your\r\nfather.... Do unto others what you would not wish them to do to you;\r\nwith this rule you will go a long way. Good-evening. Above all, don’t\r\nbe ungrateful. Let me hear of you as soon as possible through the\r\npolice news.’\r\n\r\nHe sees the village children fighting for a piece of black bread\r\ncovered with curd cheese; he immediately orders for himself a similar\r\nslice of bread, and says to his servant: ‘Throw this bread and cheese\r\nto those children who are doing for each other in the road. Let the\r\nfeeblest be crippled, not manage to get a single piece, and, besides,\r\nbe well whipped by their parents when they return home with torn\r\nbreeches and black eyes; that will give them an idea of the life that\r\nawaits them’ (p. 226).\r\n\r\nWhen he thinks of society, this cry bursts from his breast: ‘Oh,\r\nperish, society! Die, old world!’ (p. 293).\r\n\r\nLest the reader should feel curious as to the course of Des Esseintes’\r\nhistory, let us add that a serious nervous illness attacks him in his\r\nsolitude, and that his doctor imperiously orders him to return to\r\nParis and the common life. Huysmans, in a second novel, ‘_Là-bas_,’\r\nshows us what Des Esseintes eventually does in Paris. He writes a\r\nhistory of Gilles de Rais, the wholesale murderer of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, to whom Moreau de Tours’ book (treating of sexual aberrations)\r\nhas unmistakably called the attention of the Diabolist band, who are\r\nin general profoundly ignorant, but erudite on this special subject\r\nof erotomania. This furnishes M. Huysmans with the opportunity of\r\nburrowing and sniffing with swinish satisfaction into the most horrible\r\nfilth. Besides this, he exhibits in this book the mystic side of\r\ndecadentism; he shows us Des Esseintes become devout, but going at the\r\nsame time to the ‘black mass’ with a hysterical woman, etc. I have no\r\noccasion to trouble myself with this book, as repulsive as it is silly.\r\nAll I wished was to show the ideal man of decadentism.\r\n\r\nWe have him now, then, the ‘super-man’ (_surhomme_) of whom Baudelaire\r\nand his disciples dream, and whom they wish to resemble: physically,\r\nill and feeble; morally, an arrant scoundrel; intellectually, an\r\nunspeakable idiot who passes his whole time in choosing the colours\r\nof stuffs which are to drape his room artistically, in observing the\r\nmovements of mechanical fishes, in sniffing perfumes and sipping\r\nliqueurs. His raciest notion is to keep awake all night and to sleep\r\nall day, and to dip his meat into his tea. Love and friendship are\r\nunknown to him. His artistic sense consists in watching the attitude of\r\npeople before some work, in order immediately to assume the opposite\r\nposition. His complete inadaptability reveals itself in that every\r\ncontact with the world and men causes him pain. He naturally throws\r\nthe blame of his discomfort on his fellow-creatures, and rails at\r\nthem like a fish-wife. He classes them all together as villains and\r\nblockheads, and he hurls at them horrible anarchical maledictions.\r\nThe dunderhead considers himself infinitely superior to other people,\r\nand his inconceivable stupidity only equals his inflated adoration of\r\nhimself. He possesses an income of 50,000 francs, and must also have\r\nit, for such a pitiable creature would not be in a position to draw\r\none sou from society, or one grain of wheat from nature. A parasite of\r\nthe lowest grade of atavism, a sort of human sacculus,[293] he would\r\nbe condemned, if he were poor, to die miserably of hunger in so far as\r\nsociety, in misdirected charity, did not assure to him the necessaries\r\nof life in an idiot asylum.\r\n\r\nIf M. Huysmans in his Des Esseintes has shown us the Decadent with all\r\nhis instincts perverted, _i.e._, the complete Baudelairian with his\r\nanti-naturalism, his æsthetic folly and his anti-social Diabolism,\r\nanother representative of decadent literature, M. Maurice Barrès, is\r\nthe incarnation of the pure ego-mania of the incapacity of adaptation\r\nin the degenerate. He has dedicated up to the present a series of four\r\nnovels to the _culte du moi_, and has annotated, besides, an edition\r\nof the three first in a brochure much more valuable for our inquiry\r\nthan the novels themselves, inasmuch as all the sophisms by which\r\nconsciousness forces itself to explain _a posteriori_ the impulsions of\r\nmorbid unconscious life appear here conveniently summed up in a sort of\r\nphilosophical system.\r\n\r\nA few words on M. Maurice Barrès. He first made himself talked\r\nof by defending, in the Parisian press, his friend Chambige, the\r\nAlgerian homicide, a logical cultivator of the ‘Ego.’ Then he became\r\na Boulangist deputy, and later he canonized Marie Bashkirtseff, a\r\ndegenerate girl who died of phthisis, a victim to moral madness, with\r\na touch of the megalomania and the mania of persecution, as well as of\r\nmorbid erotic exaltation. He invoked her as ‘Our Lady of the wagon-lit’\r\n(_Notre Dame du Sleeping_).[294]\r\n\r\nHis novels, _Sous l’[Œil des Barbares_, _Un Homme libre_, _Le Jardin\r\nde Bérénice_, and _L’Ennemi des Lois_, are constructed after the\r\nartistic formula established by M. Huysmans. The description of a\r\nhuman being, with his intellectual life, and his monotonous, scarcely\r\nmodulated external destinies, gives the author a pretext for expressing\r\nhis own ideas on all possible subjects; on Leonardo da Vinci and\r\nVenice;[295] on a French provincial museum and the industrial art of\r\nthe Middle Ages;[296] on Nero,[297] Saint Simon, Fourier, Marx, and\r\nLassalle.[298] Formerly it was the custom to utilize these excursions\r\ninto all possible fields of discussion as articles for newspapers or\r\nmonthly periodicals, and afterwards to collect them in book form. But\r\nexperience has taught that the public does not exhibit much interest\r\nin these collections of essays, and the Decadents have adopted the\r\nclever ruse of connecting them by means of a scarcely perceptible\r\nthread of narrative, and presenting them to their readers as a novel.\r\nThe English novelists of the preceding century, then Stendhal, Jean\r\nPaul and Goethe himself, have also made use of these insertions of the\r\nauthor’s personal reflections in the course of the story; but with them\r\n(with the exception, perhaps, of Jean Paul) these interpellations were\r\nat least subordinated to the work of art as a whole. It was reserved\r\nfor M. Huysmans and his school to give them the chief place, and to\r\ntransform the novel from an epic poem in prose into a hybrid mixture of\r\n_Essais_ of Montaigne, of _Parerga et Paralipomena_ of Schopenhauer,\r\nand the effusions in the diary of a girl at a boarding-school.\r\n\r\nM. Barrès makes it no secret that he has described his own life in his\r\nnovels, and that he considers himself a typical representative of a\r\nspecies. ‘These monographs ... are,’ he says,[299] ‘a communication\r\nof a type of young man already frequently met with, and which, I\r\nfeel sure, will become still more numerous among the pupils who are\r\nnow at the Lycée.... These books ... will eventually be consulted as\r\ndocuments.’\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of this type? Let us answer this question in the\r\nauthor’s own words. The hero of the novels is ‘somewhat literary,\r\nproud, fastidious and _désarmé_’ (_Examen_, p. 11); ‘a young\r\n_bourgeois_ grown pale, and starving for all pleasures’ (p. 26);\r\n‘discouraged by contact with men’ (p. 34); he is one of those ‘who find\r\nthemselves in a sad state in the midst of the order of the world ...\r\nwho feel themselves weak in facing life’ (p. 45). Can one imagine a\r\nmore complete description of the degenerate incapable of adaptation,\r\nbadly equipped for the struggle for existence, and for this reason\r\nhating and fearing the world and men, but shaken at the same time by\r\nmorbid desires?\r\n\r\nThis poor shattered creature, who was necessarily rendered an\r\nego-maniac by the weakness of will in his imperfect brain, and the\r\nperpetual turmoil of his unhealthy organs, raises his infirmities to\r\nthe dignity of a system which he proudly proclaims. ‘Let us keep to\r\nour only reality, to our “I”’ (p. 18). ‘There is only one thing which\r\nwe know and which really exists.... This sole tangible reality, it is\r\nthe “I,” and the universe is only a fresco which it makes beautiful\r\nor ugly. Let us keep to our “I.” Let us protect it against strangers,\r\nagainst Barbarians’ (p. 45).\r\n\r\nWhat does he mean by Barbarians? These are the ‘beings who possess\r\na dream of life opposed to that which he (the hero of one of his\r\nbooks) forms of it. If they happen to be, moreover, highly cultured,\r\nthey are strangers and adversaries for him.’ A young man ‘obliged by\r\ncircumstances to meet persons who are not of his _patrie psychique_’\r\nexperiences ‘a shock.’ ‘Ah! what matters to me the quality of a\r\nsoul which contradicts some sensibility? I hate these strangers who\r\nimpede, or turn aside the development of such a delicate hesitating\r\nand self-searching “I,” these Barbarians through whom more than one\r\nimpressionable young man will both fail in his career and not find his\r\njoy of living’ (p. 23). ‘Soldiers, magistrates, moralists, teachers,’\r\nthese are the Barbarians who place obstacles in the way of the\r\ndevelopment of the “I”’ (p. 43). In one word, the ‘I’ who cannot take\r\nhis bearings in the social order regards all the representatives and\r\ndefenders of that order as his enemies. What he would like would be ‘to\r\ngive himself up without resistance to the force of his instincts’ (p.\r\n25), to distinguish ‘where lie his sincere curiosity, the direction of\r\nhis instinct, and his truth’ (p. 47). This idea of setting instinct,\r\npassion and the unconscious life free from the superintendence of\r\nreason, judgment and consciousness recurs hundreds of times in the\r\nauthor’s novels. ‘Taste takes the place of morality’ (_L’Ennemi\r\ndes Lois_, p. 3). ‘As a man, and a free man, may I accomplish my\r\ndestiny, respect and favour my interior impulsion, without taking\r\ncounsel of anything outside me’ (p. 22). ‘Society enclosed by a line\r\nof demarcation! You offer slavery to whoever does not conform to the\r\ndefinitions of the beautiful and the good adopted by the majority. In\r\nthe name of humanity, as formerly in the name of God and the City, what\r\ncrimes are devised against the individual!’ (p. 200). ‘The inclinations\r\nof man ought not to be forced, but the social system must be adapted\r\nto them’ (p. 97). (It would be very much more simple to adapt the\r\ninclinations of a single man to the social system which is a law to\r\nmillions of men, but this does not seem to suggest itself to our\r\nphilosopher!)\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely logical that M. Barrès, after having shown us in his\r\nthree first novels or _idéologies_ the development of his ‘cultivator\r\nof the _moi_,’ should make the latter become an anarchist and an\r\n_ennemi des lois_. But he feels himself that the objection will be\r\njustly raised, that society cannot exist without a law and an order\r\nof some sort, and he seeks to forestall this objection by asserting\r\nthat everyone knows how to behave himself, that instinct is good and\r\ninfallible: ‘Do you not feel,’ he says (p. 177), ‘that our instinct\r\nhas profited by the long apprenticeship of our race amid codes and\r\nreligions?’ He admits then that ‘codes and religions’ have their use\r\nand necessity, but only at a primitive period of human history. When\r\nthe instincts were still wild, bad and unreasonable, they required the\r\ndiscipline of the law. But now they are so perfect that this guide and\r\nmaster is no longer necessary to them. But there are still criminals.\r\nWhat is to be done with them? ‘By stifling them with kisses and\r\nproviding for their wants they would be prevented from doing any harm.’\r\nI should like to see M. Barrès obliged to use his method of defence\r\nagainst a night attack of garrotters!\r\n\r\nTo allow one’s self to be carried away by instincts is, in other\r\nwords, to make unconscious life the master of consciousness, to\r\nsubordinate the highest nervous centres to the inferior centres.\r\nBut all progress rests on this, that the highest centres assume more\r\nand more authority over the entire organism, that judgment and will\r\ncontrol and direct ever more strictly the instincts and passions, that\r\nconsciousness encroaches ever further on the domain of the unconscious,\r\nand continually annexes new portions of the latter. Of course, instinct\r\nexpresses a directly felt need, the satisfaction of which procures a\r\ndirect pleasure. But this need is often that of a single organ, and\r\nits satisfaction, however agreeable to the organ which demands it,\r\nmay be pernicious, and even fatal, to the total organism. Then there\r\nare anti-social instincts, the gratification of which is not directly\r\ninjurious to the organism itself, it is true, but makes life in common\r\nwith the race difficult or impossible, worsening consequently its\r\nvital conditions, and preparing its ruin indirectly. Judgment alone is\r\nfitted to oppose these instincts by the representation of the needs\r\nof the collective organism and of the race, and the will has the\r\ntask of ensuring the victory over suicidal instinct to the rational\r\nrepresentation. Judgment may be deceived, for it is the result of the\r\nwork of a highly differentiated and delicate instrument, which, like\r\nall fine and complicated machinery, gets out of order more easily than\r\na simpler and rougher tool. Instinct, the inherited and organized\r\nexperience of the race, is as a rule more sure and reliable. This must\r\ncertainly be admitted. But what harm is done if judgment does make\r\na mistake for once in the opposition which it offers to instinct?\r\nThe organism is, as a rule, only deprived of a momentary feeling of\r\npleasure; it suffers therefore at most a negative loss; the will, on\r\nthe other hand, will have made an effort, and acquired strength by the\r\nexercise, and this is for the organism a positive gain, which nearly\r\nalways at least balances those negative losses.\r\n\r\nAnd then all these considerations take for granted the perfect health\r\nof the organism, for in such a one only does the unconscious work as\r\nnormally as consciousness. But we have seen above that the unconscious\r\nitself is subject to disease; it may be stupid, obtuse and mad, like\r\nconsciousness; it then ceases completely to be dependable; then the\r\ninstincts are as worthless guides as are the blind or drunken; then\r\nthe organism, if it gives itself up to them, must stagger to ruin and\r\ndeath. The only thing which can sometimes save it in this case is the\r\nconstant, anxious, tense vigilance of the judgment, and as the latter\r\nis never capable, by its own resources, of resisting a strong flood\r\nof revolted and riotous instincts, it must demand reinforcements from\r\nthe judgment of the race, _i.e._, from some law, from some recognised\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nSuch is the foolish aberration of the ‘cultivators of the “I.”’\r\nThey fall into the same errors as the shallow psychologists of the\r\neighteenth century, who only recognised reason; they only see one\r\nportion of man’s mental life, _i.e._, his unconscious life; they wish\r\nto receive their law only from instinct, but wholly neglect to notice\r\nthat instinct may become degenerate, diseased, exhausted, and thereby\r\nbe rendered as useless for legislative purposes as a raving lunatic or\r\nan idiot.\r\n\r\nBesides, M. Barrès contradicts his own theories at every step. While\r\nhe pretends to believe that instincts are always good, he depicts many\r\nof his heroines, with the most tender expressions of admiration, as\r\nveritable moral monsters. The ‘little princess’ in _L’Ennemi des Lois_\r\nis a feminine Des Esseintes: she boasts of having been, as a child,\r\n‘the scourge of the house’ (p. 146). She looks upon her parents as\r\nher ‘enemies’ (p. 149). She loves children ‘less than dogs’ (p. 284).\r\nNaturally, she gives herself at once to every man that strikes her eye,\r\nfor, otherwise, where would be the use of being a ‘cultivator of the\r\n“Ego,”’ and an adept at the law of instinct? Such are the good beings\r\nof M. Barrès, who no longer need laws, because they have ‘profited by\r\nthe long apprenticeship of our race.’\r\n\r\nYet a few more traits to complete the mental portrait of this Decadent.\r\nHe makes his ‘little princess’ relate: ‘When I was twelve years old,\r\nI loved, as soon as I was alone in the country, to take off my shoes\r\nand stockings and plunge my bare feet into warm mud. I passed hours in\r\nthis way, and that gave me a thrill of pleasure through all my body.’\r\nM. Barrès resembles his heroine; he ‘experiences a thrill of pleasure\r\nthrough all his body’ when he ‘plunges himself into warm mud.’\r\n\r\n‘There is not a detail in the biography of Berenice which is not\r\nshocking’--thus begins the third chapter of the _Jardin de Bérénice_.\r\n‘I, however, retain of it none but very delicate sensations.’ This\r\nBerenice was a dancer at the Eden Theatre in Paris, whom her mother and\r\nelder sister had sold as a little child to some old criminals, and whom\r\na lover took away later from the prostitution which had already stained\r\nher infancy. This lover dies and leaves her a considerable fortune.\r\nThe hero of the novel, who had known her as a gutter-child, meets\r\nher at Arles, where he presents himself as the Boulangist candidate\r\nfor the Chamber, and he resumes his ancient relations with her. What\r\ncharms him most in their intercourse, and increases his pleasure in the\r\nhighest degree, is the idea of the intense love she felt for her dead\r\nlover, and the abandonment with which she had reposed in his arms. ‘My\r\nBerenice, who still bears on her pale lips and against her dazzling\r\nteeth the kisses of M. de Transe [the lover in question].... The young\r\nman who is no more has left her as much passion as can be contained\r\nin a woman’s heart’ (p. 138). The feeling which M. Barrès seeks to\r\ncrown with the help of inflated, grandiloquent expressions is simply\r\nthe well-known excitement that hoary sinners feel at the sight of the\r\nerotic exploits of others. All those who are conversant with Parisian\r\nlife know what is meant in Paris by a _voyeur_, or pryer. M. Barrès\r\nreveals himself here as a metaphysical _voyeur_. And yet he would\r\nwish to make us believe that his little street-walker, whose dirty\r\nadventures he describes with the warmth of love and the enthusiasm of a\r\ndilettante, is in reality a symbol; it is only as a Symbolist that he\r\nclaims to have formed her. ‘A young woman is seen about a young man.\r\nIs it not rather the history of a soul with its two elements, female\r\nand male?’ Or is it by the side of the ‘I’ which guards itself, wishes\r\nto know and establish itself, also the imagination in a young and\r\nsensitive person, for the taste pleasure and for vagabondage?[300] One\r\nmay well ask him, where is the ‘symbolism’ in the biographical details\r\nof Petite Secousse, the name that he gives to his ‘symbol.’\r\n\r\nDisease and corruption exercise the customary Baudelairian attraction\r\nover him. ‘When Berenice was a little girl,’ he says, in the _Jardin\r\nde Bérénice_ (p. 72), ‘I much regretted that she had not some physical\r\ninfirmity.... A blemish is what I prefer above everything ... flatters\r\nthe dearest foibles of my mind.’ And in one place (p. 282) an engineer\r\nis scoffed at ‘who wishes to substitute some pond for carp for our\r\nmarshes full of beautiful fevers.’\r\n\r\nThe stigmata of degeneracy known as zoöphilia, or excessive love for\r\nanimals, is strongly shown in him. When he wishes particularly to edify\r\nhimself he runs ‘to contemplate the beautiful eyes of the seal, and to\r\ndistress himself over the mysterious sufferings of these tender-hearted\r\nanimals shown in their basin, brothers of the dogs and of us.’[301]\r\nThe only educator that M. Barrès admits is--the dog. ‘The education\r\nwhich a dog gives is indeed excellent!... Our collegians, overloaded\r\nwith intellectual acquisitions, which remain in them as notions, not\r\nas methods of feeling, weighted by opinions which they are unable\r\nthoroughly to grasp, would learn beautiful ease from the dog, the\r\ngift of listening, the instinct of their “I.”’[302] And it must not\r\nbe imagined that in such passages as these he is quizzing himself or\r\nmocking the Philistine who may by inadvertence have become a reader of\r\nthe book. The part played by two dogs in the novel testifies that the\r\nphrases quoted are meant in bitter earnest.\r\n\r\nLike all the truly degenerate, M. Barrès reserves for the hysterical\r\nand the demented all the admiration and fraternal love which he\r\nhas not expended on seals and dogs. We have already mentioned his\r\nenthusiastic regard for poor Marie Bashkirtseff. His idea of Louis II.\r\nof Bavaria is incomparable. The unfortunate King is, in his eyes, an\r\n_insatisfait_ (_L’Ennemi des Lois_, p. 201); he speaks of ‘his being\r\ncarried away beyond his native surroundings, his ardent desire to make\r\nhis dream tangible, the wrecking of his imagination in the clumsiness\r\nof execution’ (p. 203). Louis II. is ‘a most perfect ethical problem’\r\n(p. 200). ‘How could this brother of Parsifal, so pure, so simple, who\r\nset the prompting of his heart in opposition to all human laws--how\r\ncould he suffer a foreign will to interfere in his life? And it really\r\nseems that to have drawn Dr. Gudden under water was his revenge upon\r\na barbarian who had wished to impose his rule of life upon him’ (p.\r\n225). It is in such phrases that M. Barrès characterizes a madman,\r\nwhose mind was completely darkened, and who for years was incapable\r\nof a single reasonable idea! This impudent fashion of blinking a fact\r\nwhich boxed his ears on both sides; this incapacity to recognise the\r\nirrationality in the mental life of an invalid, fallen to the lowest\r\ndegree of insanity; this obstinacy in explaining the craziest deeds as\r\ndeliberate, intentional, philosophically justified and full of deep\r\nsense, throw a vivid light on the state of mind in the Decadent. How\r\ncould a being of this kind discern the pathological disturbance of his\r\nown brain, when he does not even perceive that Louis II. was not ‘an\r\nethical problem,’ but an ordinary mad patient, such as every lunatic\r\nasylum of any size contains by dozens?\r\n\r\nWe now understand the philosophy and moral doctrine of the Barrès type\r\nof the ‘cultivators of the “I.”’ Only one word more on their conduct in\r\npractical life. The hero of the _Jardin de Bérénice_, Philippe, is the\r\nhappy guest of Petite Secousse, in the house which her last lover had\r\nleft to her. After some time he wearies of the latter’s ‘educational\r\ninfluence’; he leaves her, and strongly advises her to marry his\r\nopponent in the election--which she does. ‘The enemy of the laws,’\r\nan anarchist of the name of André Maltère, condemned to prison for\r\nseveral months for a newspaper article eulogizing a dynamite attempt,\r\nhas become, by his trial, a celebrity of the day. A very rich orphan\r\noffers him her hand, and the ‘little princess’ her love. He marries the\r\nrich girl, whom he does not love, and continues to love the ‘little\r\nprincess,’ whom he does not marry. For this is what the ‘culture of\r\nhis “I”’ exacts. To satisfy his æsthetic inclinations and to ‘act’ by\r\nword and pen, he must have money, and to relieve the needs of his heart\r\nhe must have the ‘little princess.’ After some months of marriage he\r\nfinds it inconvenient to dissimulate his love for the ‘little princess’\r\nbefore his wife. He allows her then to guess at the needs of his heart.\r\nHis wife understands philosophy. She is ‘comprehensive.’ She goes\r\nherself to the ‘little princess,’ takes her to the noble anarchist,\r\nand from this moment Maltère lives rich, loved, happy, and satisfied\r\nbetween heiress and mistress, as becomes a superior nature. M. Barrès\r\nbelieves he has here created ‘a rare and exquisite type.’ He deceives\r\nhimself. The cultivators of the ‘I,’ like the Boulangist Philippe and\r\nthe anarchist André, meet by thousands in all large towns, only the\r\npolice know them under another name. They call them _souteneurs_. The\r\nmoral law of the brave anarchist has long been that of the gilded Paris\r\nprostitutes, who from time immemorial have kept ‘_l’amant de cœur_,’ at\r\nthe same time as the ‘other,’ or the ‘others.’\r\n\r\nDecadentism has not been confined to France alone; it has also\r\nestablished a school in England. We have already mentioned, in the\r\npreceding book, one of the earliest and most servile imitators of\r\nBaudelaire--Swinburne. I had to class him among the mystics, for the\r\ndegenerative stigma of mysticism predominates in all his works. He has,\r\nit is true, been train-bearer to so many models that he may be ranked\r\namong the domestic servants of a great number of masters; but, finally,\r\nhe will be assigned a place where he has served longest, and that is\r\namong the pre-Raphaelites. From Baudelaire he has borrowed principally\r\ndiabolism and Sadism, unnatural depravity, and a predilection for\r\nsuffering, disease and crime. The ego-mania of decadentism, its love of\r\nthe artificial, its aversion to nature, and to all forms of activity\r\nand movement, its megalomaniacal contempt for men and its exaggeration\r\nof the importance of art, have found their English representative among\r\nthe ‘Æsthetes,’ the chief of whom is Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nWilde has done more by his personal eccentricities than by his works.\r\nLike Barbey d’Aurevilly, whose rose-coloured silk hats and gold lace\r\ncravats are well known, and like his disciple Joséphin Péladan, who\r\nwalks about in lace frills and satin doublet, Wilde dresses in queer\r\ncostumes which recall partly the fashions of the Middle Ages, partly\r\nthe rococo modes. He pretends to have abandoned the dress of the\r\npresent time because it offends his sense of the beautiful; but this\r\nis only a pretext in which probably he himself does not believe. What\r\nreally determines his actions is the hysterical craving to be noticed,\r\nto occupy the attention of the world with himself, to get talked about.\r\nIt is asserted that he has walked down Pall Mall in the afternoon\r\ndressed in doublet and breeches, with a picturesque biretta on his\r\nhead, and a sunflower in his hand, the quasi-heraldic symbol of the\r\nÆsthetes. This anecdote has been reproduced in all the biographies of\r\nWilde, and I have nowhere seen it denied. But is a promenade with a\r\nsunflower in the hand also inspired by a craving for the beautiful?\r\n\r\nPhasemakers are perpetually repeating the twaddle, that it is a proof\r\nof honourable independence to follow one’s own taste without being\r\nbound down to the regulation costume of the Philistine cattle, and\r\nto choose for clothes the colours, materials and cut which appear\r\nbeautiful to one’s self, no matter how much they may differ from the\r\nfashion of the day. The answer to this cackle should be that it is\r\nabove all a sign of anti-social ego-mania to irritate the majority\r\nunnecessarily, only to gratify vanity, or an æsthetical instinct of\r\nsmall importance and easy to control--such as is always done when,\r\neither by word or deed, a man places himself in opposition to this\r\nmajority. He is obliged to repress many manifestations of opinions and\r\ndesires out of regard for his fellow-creatures; to make him understand\r\nthis is the aim of education, and he who has not learnt to impose\r\nsome restraint upon himself in order not to shock others is called by\r\nmalicious Philistines, not an Æsthete, but a blackguard.\r\n\r\nIt may become a duty to combat the vulgar herd in the cause of truth\r\nand knowledge; but to a serious man this duty will always be felt as a\r\npainful one. He will never fulfil it with a light heart, and he will\r\nexamine strictly and cautiously if it be really a high and absolutely\r\nimperative law which forces him to be disagreeable to the majority of\r\nhis fellow-creatures. Such an action is, in the eyes of a moral and\r\nsane man, a kind of martyrdom for a conviction, to carry out which\r\nconstitutes a vital necessity; it is a form, and not an easy form, of\r\nself-sacrifice, for it means the renunciation of the joy which the\r\nconsciousness of sympathy with one’s fellow-creatures gives, and it\r\nexacts the painful overthrow of social instincts, which, in truth, do\r\nnot exist in deranged ego-maniacs, but are very strong in the normal\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe predilection for strange costume is a pathological aberration of\r\na racial instinct. The adornment of the exterior has its origin in\r\nthe strong desire to be admired by others--primarily by the opposite\r\nsex--to be recognised by them as especially well-shaped, handsome,\r\nyouthful, or rich and powerful, or as preeminent through rank or merit.\r\nIt is practised, then, with the object of producing a favourable\r\nimpression on others, and is a result of thought about others, of\r\npreoccupation with the race. If, now, this adornment be, not through\r\nmis-judgment but purposely, of a character to cause irritation to\r\nothers, or lend itself to ridicule--in other words, if it excites\r\ndisapproval instead of approbation--it then runs exactly counter to the\r\nobject of the art of dress, and evinces a perversion of the instinct of\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\nThe pretence of a sense of beauty is the excuse of consciousness for a\r\ncrank of the conscious. The fool who masquerades in Pall Mall does not\r\nsee himself, and, therefore, does not enjoy the beautiful appearance\r\nwhich is supposed to be an æsthetic necessity for him. There would be\r\nsome sense in his conduct if it had for its object an endeavour to\r\ncause others to dress in accordance with his taste; for them he sees,\r\nand they can scandalize him by the ugliness, and charm him by the\r\nbeauty, of their costume. But to take the initiative in a new artistic\r\nstyle in dress brings the innovator not one hair’s breadth nearer his\r\nassumed goal of æsthetic satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, an Oscar Wilde goes about in ‘æsthetic costume’ among\r\ngazing Philistines, exciting either their ridicule or their wrath, it\r\nis no indication of independence of character, but rather from a purely\r\nanti-socialistic, ego-maniacal recklessness and hysterical longing to\r\nmake a sensation, justified by no exalted aim; nor is it from a strong\r\ndesire for beauty, but from a malevolent mania for contradiction.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Wilde obtained, by his buffoon mummery, a notoriety\r\nin the whole Anglo-Saxon world that his poems and dramas would never\r\nhave acquired for him. I have no reason to trouble myself about these,\r\nsince they are feeble imitations of Rossetti and Swinburne, and of\r\ndreary inanity. His prose essays, on the contrary, deserve attention,\r\nbecause they exhibit all the features which enable us to recognise in\r\nthe ‘Æsthete’ the comrade in art of the Decadent.\r\n\r\nLike his French masters, Oscar Wilde despises Nature. ‘Whatever\r\nactually occurs is spoiled for art. All bad poetry springs from genuine\r\nfeeling. To be natural is to be obvious, and to be obvious is to be\r\ninartistic.’[303]\r\n\r\nHe is a ‘cultivator of the Ego,’ and feels deliciously indignant at\r\nthe fact that Nature dares to be indifferent to his important person.\r\n‘Nature is so indifferent, so unappreciative. Whenever I am walking in\r\nthe park here, I always feel that I am no more to her than the cattle\r\nthat browse on the slope’ (p. 5).\r\n\r\nWith regard to himself and the human species, he shares the opinion of\r\nDes Esseintes. ‘Ah! don’t say that you agree with me. When people agree\r\nwith me I always feel that I must be wrong’ (p. 202).\r\n\r\nHis ideal of life is inactivity. ‘It is only the Philistine who seeks\r\nto estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production. This young\r\ndandy sought to be somebody rather than to do something’ (p. 65).\r\n‘Society often forgives the criminal; it never forgives the dreamer.\r\nThe beautiful sterile emotions that art excites in us are hateful in\r\nits eyes.... People ... are always coming shamelessly up to one ...\r\nand saying in a loud, stentorian voice, “What are you doing?” whereas,\r\n“What are you thinking?” is the only question that any civilized being\r\nshould ever be allowed to whisper to another.... Contemplation ...\r\nin the opinion of the highest culture, is the proper occupation of\r\nman.... It is to do nothing that the elect exist. Action is limited and\r\nrelative. Unlimited and absolute is the vision of him who sits at ease\r\nand watches, who walks in loneliness and dreams’ (pp. 166-168). ‘The\r\nsure way of knowing nothing about life is to try to make one’s self\r\nuseful’ (p. 175). ‘From time to time the world cries out against some\r\ncharming artistic poet, because, to use its hackneyed and silly phrase,\r\nhe has “nothing to say.” But if he had something to say, he would\r\nprobably say it, and the result would be tedious. It is just because he\r\nhas no new message that he can do beautiful work’ (p. 197).\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde apparently admires immorality, sin and crime. In a very\r\naffectionate biographical treatise on Thomas Griffith Wainwright,\r\ndesigner, painter, and author, and the murderer of several people, he\r\nsays: ‘He was a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities, and as a\r\nsubtle and secret poisoner almost without rival in this or any age.\r\nThis remarkable man, so powerful with “pen, pencil, and poison,”’ etc.\r\n(p. 60). ‘He sought to find expression by pen or poison’ (p. 61).\r\n‘When a friend reproached him with the murder of Helen Abercrombie, he\r\nshrugged his shoulders and said, “Yes; it was a dreadful thing to do,\r\nbut she had very thick ankles”’ (p. 86). ‘His crimes seem to have had\r\nan important effect upon his art. They gave a strong personality to his\r\nstyle, a quality that his early work certainly lacked’ (p. 88). ‘There\r\nis no sin except stupidity’ (p. 210). ‘An idea that is not dangerous is\r\nunworthy of being called an idea at all’ (p. 179).\r\n\r\nHe cultivates incidentally a slight mysticism in colours. ‘He,’\r\nWainwright, ‘had that curious love of green which in individuals is\r\nalways the sign of a subtle, artistic temperament, and in nations is\r\nsaid to denote a laxity, if not a decadence of morals’ (p. 66).\r\n\r\nBut the central idea of his tortuously disdainful prattling, pursuing\r\nas its chief aim the heckling of the Philistine, and laboriously\r\nseeking the opposite pole to sound common-sense, is the glorification\r\nof art. Wilde sets forth in the following manner the system of the\r\n‘Æsthetes’: ‘Briefly, then, their doctrines are these: Art never\r\nexpresses anything but itself. It has an independent life, just as\r\nThought has, and develops purely on its own lines.... The second\r\ndoctrine is this: All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature,\r\nand elevating them into ideals. Life and Nature may sometimes be used\r\nas part of Art’s rough material, but before they are of any real\r\nservice to Art they must be translated into artistic conventions.\r\nThe moment Art surrenders its imaginative medium [?] it surrenders\r\neverything. As a method Realism is a complete failure, and the two\r\nthings that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and\r\nmodernity of subject matter.[304] To us who live in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, any century is a suitable subject for art except our own.\r\nThe only beautiful things are the things that do not concern us....\r\nIt is exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows are\r\nso suitable a motive for a tragedy....’[305] (pp. 52-54). The third\r\ndoctrine is that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.\r\nThis results not merely from Life’s imitative instinct, but from the\r\nfact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and\r\nthat Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realize\r\nthat energy’ (p. 65).\r\n\r\nOn this third point--the influence of art on life--Wilde does not refer\r\nto the fact, long ago established by me, that the reciprocal relation\r\nbetween the work of art and the public consists in this, that the\r\nformer exercises suggestion and the latter submits to it.[306] What he\r\nactually wished to say was that nature--not civilized men--develops\r\nitself in the direction of forms given it by the artist. ‘Where, if\r\nnot from the Impressionists, do we get those wonderful brown fogs that\r\ncome creeping down our streets, blurring the gas-lamps and changing\r\nthe houses into monstrous shadows? To whom, if not to them and their\r\nmaster, do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our river,\r\nand turn to faint forms of fading grace, curved bridge and swaying\r\nbarge? The extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of\r\nLondon during the last ten years is entirely due to this particular\r\nschool of Art’ (p. 40). If he simply wished to affirm that formerly\r\nfog and mist were not felt to be beautiful, and that the artistic\r\nrendering of them first drew to them the attention of the multitude,\r\nnothing could be said in contradiction; he would have propounded just\r\na hackneyed commonplace with misplaced sententiousness. He asserts,\r\nhowever, that painters have changed the climate, that for the last\r\nten years there have been fogs in London, because the Impressionists\r\nhave painted fogs--a statement so silly as to require no refutation.\r\nIt is sufficient to characterize it as artistic mysticism. Lastly,\r\nWilde teaches the following: ‘Æsthetics are higher than ethics. They\r\nbelong to a more spiritual sphere. To discern the beauty of a thing is\r\nthe finest point to which we can arrive. Even a colour-sense is more\r\nimportant in the development of the individual than a sense of right\r\nand wrong’ (pp. 210, 211).\r\n\r\nThus the doctrine of the ‘Æsthetes’ affirms, with the Parnassians, that\r\nthe work of art is its own aim; with the Diabolists, that it need not\r\nbe moral--nay, were better to be immoral; with the Decadents, that it\r\nis to avoid, and be diametrically opposed to, the natural and the true;\r\nand with all these schools of the ego-mania of degeneration, that art\r\nis the highest of all human functions.\r\n\r\nHere is the place to demonstrate the absurdity of these propositions.\r\nThis can, of course, be done only in the concisest manner. For to treat\r\nfully of the relation of the beautiful to morals and truth to Nature,\r\nof the conception of aim in artistic beauty, and of the rank held by\r\nart among mental functions, it would be necessary to expound the whole\r\nscience of æsthetics, on which the somewhat exhaustive text-books\r\namount to a considerable number of volumes; and this cannot be my\r\npurpose in this place. Hence I shall of necessity only recapitulate the\r\nlatest results in a series of the clearest and most obvious deductions\r\npossible, which the attentive reader will be able without difficulty to\r\ndevelop by his own reflection.\r\n\r\nThe ‘bonzes’ of art, who proclaim the doctrine of ‘art for art’s sake,’\r\nlook down with contempt upon those who deny their dogma, affirming that\r\nthe heretics who ascribe to works of art any aim whatsoever can be only\r\npachydermatous Philistines, whose comprehension is limited to beans and\r\nbacon, or stock-jobbers with whom it is only a question of profit, or\r\nsanctimonious parsons making a professional pretence of virtue. They\r\nbelieve that they are supported in this by such men as Kant, Lessing,\r\netc., who were likewise of the opinion that the work of art had but\r\none task to perform--that of being beautiful. We need not be overawed\r\nby the great names of these guarantors. Their opinion cannot withstand\r\nthe criticism to which it has been subjected during the last hundred\r\nyears by a great number of philosophers (I name only Fichte, Hegel and\r\nVischer), and its inadequacy follows from the fact, among others, that\r\nit allows absolutely no place for the ugly as an object of artistic\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nLet us remind ourselves how works of art and art in general originated.\r\n\r\nThat plastic art originally sprang from the imitation of Nature is a\r\ncommonplace, open justly to the reproach that it does not enter deeply\r\nenough into the question. Imitation is without doubt one of the first\r\nand most general reactions of the developed living being upon the\r\nimpressions it receives from the external world. This is a necessary\r\nconsequence of the mechanism of the higher activity of the nervous\r\nsystem. Every compound movement must be preceded by the representation\r\nof this movement, and, conversely, no representation of movement can be\r\nelaborated without at least a faint and hinted accomplishment of the\r\ncorresponding movement by the muscles. Upon this principle depends,\r\nfor example, the well-known ‘thought-reading.’ As often, therefore,\r\nas a being (whose nervous system is developed highly enough to raise\r\nperceptions to the rank of representations) acquires knowledge, _i.e._,\r\nforms for itself a representation of any phenomenon whatever comprising\r\nin itself a more or less molar form of movement (molecular movements,\r\nand, _a fortiori_, vibrations of ether are not directly recognised as\r\nchanges of position in space), it has also a tendency to transform the\r\nrepresentation into a movement resembling it, and hence to imitate\r\nthe phenomenon, in that form, naturally, which, with its means, it\r\nis capable of realizing. If every representation be not embodied in\r\nperceptible movement, the cause is to be traced to the action of\r\nthe inhibitive mechanism of the brain, which does not permit every\r\nrepresentation at once to set the muscles into activity. In a state of\r\nfatigue inhibition is relaxed, and, in fact, all sorts of unintentional\r\nimitations make their appearance, as, for example, symmetrical\r\nmovements, such as the left hand involuntarily and aimlessly makes of\r\nthose executed by the right hand in writing, etc. There is also a rare\r\ndisease of the nerves[307] hitherto observed chiefly in Russia, and\r\nespecially in Siberia, there called _myriachit_, in which inhibition\r\nbecomes completely disorganized, so that the diseased persons are\r\nforced at once to imitate any action seen by them, even if it be\r\ndisagreeable or pernicious to them. If, for example, they see someone\r\nfall, they are compelled to throw themselves also to the ground, even\r\nif they are standing in a muddy road.\r\n\r\nExcept in disease and fatigue, the action of inhibition is suspended\r\nonly when the excitation produced in the nervous system by an\r\nimpression is strong enough to vanquish it. If this impression is\r\ndisagreeable, or menacing, the movements set loose by it are those of\r\ndefence or flight. If, on the contrary, the impression is pleasant,\r\nor if it is surprising without being disquieting, then the reaction\r\nof the organism against it is a movement without objective aim, most\r\nfrequently a movement of imitation. Hence, among healthy men possessed\r\nof well-working inhibitory mechanism in their nervous system, this\r\nmovement does not appear with every phenomenon, but only with such as\r\nstrike it forcibly, fix its attention, engage and stimulate it--in a\r\nword, cause an emotion. Activity of imitation (and the plastic arts\r\nare at bottom nothing but residuary traces of imitative movements)\r\nhas consequently an immediate organic aim, viz., the freeing of the\r\nnervous system from an excitation set up in it by some visual cause. If\r\nthe excitation is not caused by the sight of any external phenomenon,\r\nbut by an internal organic state (_e.g._, sexual _erethism_), or by\r\na representation of an abstract nature (_e.g._, the joy of victory,\r\nsorrow, or longing), it likewise transforms itself, it is true, into\r\nmovements; but these are naturally not imitative. They embody no motor\r\nrepresentation, but are in part such as have for their sole end the\r\nrelaxing of the nerve-centres overcharged with motor impulsions, as in\r\nthe dance, in outcries, song and music, and in part such as disburden\r\nthe centres of ideation, like declamation, lyric and epic poetry. If\r\nartistic activity is frequently exercised and facilitated by habit, it\r\nno longer requires emotions of extraordinary strength to provoke it. As\r\noften, then, as man is excited by such external or internal impressions\r\nas demand no action (conflict, flight, adaptation), but reach his\r\nconsciousness in the form of a mood, he relieves his nervous system of\r\nthis excitation through some kind of artistic activity, either by means\r\nof the plastic arts or by music and poetry.\r\n\r\nHence imitation is not the source of the arts, but one of the media\r\nof art; the real source of art is emotion. Artistic activity is not\r\nits own end, but it is of direct utility to the artist; it satisfies\r\nthe need of his organism to transform its emotions into movement. He\r\ncreates the work of art, not for its own sake, but to free his nervous\r\nsystem from a tension. The expression, which has become a commonplace,\r\nis psycho-physiologically accurate, viz., the artist writes, paints,\r\nsings, or dances the burden of some idea or feeling off his mind.\r\n\r\nTo this primary end of art--the subjective end of the self-deliverance\r\nof the artist--a second must be added, viz., the objective end of\r\nacting upon others. Like every other animal living in society and\r\npartly dependent upon it, man has, in consequence of his racial\r\ninstinct, the aspiration to impart his own emotions to those of his\r\nown species, just as he himself participates in the emotions of those\r\nof his own species. This strong desire to know himself in emotional\r\ncommunion with the species is sympathy, that organic base of the\r\nsocial edifice.[308] In advanced civilization, where the original\r\nnatural motives of actions are partly obscured and partly replaced by\r\nartificial motives, and the actions themselves receive an aim other\r\nthan the theoretical one proper to them, the artist is, it is true,\r\nnot limited to sharing his emotions with others, but creates his work\r\nof art with the accessory purpose of becoming famous--a wish springing\r\nnone the less from social instincts, since it is directed towards\r\nobtaining the applause of his fellow-creatures, or even of earning\r\nmoney, a motive no longer social, but purely egoistic. This vulgarly\r\negoistic motive is still the only one influencing the countless\r\nimitators who practise art, not from original strong desire, and as\r\nthe natural and necessary mode of expressing their emotions, but whose\r\nartistic activity is caused by the envy with which they regard the\r\nsuccess of others in art.\r\n\r\nOnce we have established, as a fact, that art is not practised for its\r\nown sake alone, but that it has a double aim, subjective and objective,\r\nviz., the satisfaction of an organic want of the artist, and the\r\ninfluencing of his fellow-creatures, then the principles by which every\r\nother human activity pursuing the same end is judged are applicable to\r\nit, _i.e._, the principles of law and morality.\r\n\r\nWe test every organic desire to see whether it be the outcome of\r\na legitimate need or the consequence of an aberration; whether\r\nits satisfaction be beneficial or pernicious to the organism. We\r\ndistinguish the healthy from the diseased impulse, and demand that\r\nthe latter be combated. If the desire seeks its satisfaction in an\r\nactivity acting upon others, then we examine to see if this activity is\r\nreconcilable with the existence and prosperity of society, or dangerous\r\nto it. The activity imperilling society offends against law and custom,\r\nwhich are nothing but an epitome of the temporary notions of society\r\nconcerning what is beneficial and what is pernicious to it.\r\n\r\nNotions healthy and diseased, moral and immoral, social or anti-social,\r\nare as valid for art as for every other human activity, and there is\r\nnot a scintilla of reason for regarding a work of art in any other\r\nlight than that in which we view every other manifestation of an\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nIt is easily conceivable that the emotion expressed by the artist in\r\nhis work may proceed from a morbid aberration, may be directed, in\r\nan unnatural, sensual, cruel manner, to what is ugly or loathsome.\r\nOught we not in this case to condemn the work and, if possible, to\r\nsuppress it? How can its right to exist be justified? By claiming\r\nthat the artist was sincere when he created it, that he gave back\r\nwhat was really existing in him, and for that reason was subjectively\r\njustified in his artistic expansion? But there is a candour which is\r\nwholly inadmissible. The dipsomaniac and clastomaniac are sincere\r\nwhen they respectively drink or break everything within reach. We do\r\nnot, however, acknowledge their right to satisfy their desire. We\r\nprevent them by force. We put them under guardianship, although their\r\ndrunkenness and destructiveness may perhaps be injurious to no one but\r\nthemselves. And still more decidedly does society oppose itself to\r\nthe satisfaction of those cravings which cannot be appeased without\r\nviolently acting upon others. The new science of criminal anthropology\r\nadmits without dispute that homicidal maniacs, certain incendiaries,\r\nmany thieves and vagabonds, act under an impulsion; that through their\r\ncrimes they satisfy an organic craving; that they outrage, kill,\r\nburn, idle, as others sit down to dinner, simply because they hunger\r\nto do so; but in spite of this and because of this, it demands that\r\nthe appeasing of the sincere longings of these degenerate creatures\r\nbe prevented by all means, and, if needs be, by their complete\r\nsuppression. It never occurs to us to permit the criminal by organic\r\ndisposition to ‘expand’ his individuality in crime, and just as little\r\ncan it be expected of us to permit the degenerate artist to expand his\r\nindividuality in immoral works of art. The artist who complacently\r\nrepresents what is reprehensible, vicious, criminal, approves of it,\r\nperhaps glorifies it, differs not in kind, but only in degree, from the\r\ncriminal who actually commits it. It is a question of the intensity of\r\nthe impulsion and the resisting power of the judgment, perhaps also\r\nof courage and cowardice; nothing else. If the actual law does not\r\ntreat the criminal by intention so rigorously as the criminal in act,\r\nit is because criminal law pursues the deed, and not the purpose; the\r\nobjective phenomenon, not its subjective roots. The Middle Ages had\r\nplaces of sanctuary where criminals could not be molested for their\r\nmisdemeanours. Modern law has done away with this institution. Ought\r\nart to be at present the last asylum to which criminals may fly to\r\nescape punishment? Are they to be able to satisfy, in the so-called\r\n‘temple’ of art, instincts which the policeman prevents them from\r\nappeasing in the street? I do not see how a privilege so inimical to\r\nsociety can be willingly defended.\r\n\r\nI am far from sharing Ruskin’s opinion that morality alone, and\r\nnothing else, can be demanded of a work of art. Morality alone is\r\nnot sufficient. Otherwise religious tracts would be the finest\r\nliterature, and the well-known coloured casts of sacred subjects turned\r\nout wholesale in Munich factories would be the choicest sculpture.\r\nExcellence of form maintains its rights in all the arts, and gives to\r\nthe finest creation its artistic value. Hence the work need not be\r\nmoral. More accurately, it need not be designed expressly to preach\r\nvirtue and the fear of God, and to be destined for the edification\r\nof devotees. But between a work without sanctified aim and one of\r\nwilful immorality there is a world of difference. A work which is\r\nindifferent from a moral point of view will not be equally attractive\r\nor satisfying to all minds, but it will offend and repel no one. An\r\nexplicitly immoral work excites in healthy persons the same feelings of\r\ndispleasure and disgust as the immoral act itself, and the form of the\r\nwork can change nothing of this. Most assuredly morality alone does not\r\ngive beauty to a work of art. But beauty without morality is impossible.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second argument with which the Æsthetes wish to\r\ndefend the right of the artist to immorality. The work of art, they\r\nsay, need only be beautiful. Beauty lies in the form. Hence the content\r\nis a matter of indifference. This may be vice and crime; but it cannot\r\nderogate from the excellences of form if these be present.\r\n\r\nHe alone can venture to advance such principles who is without the\r\nleast inkling of the psycho-physiology of the æsthetic feelings.\r\nEveryone who has studied this subject in the least knows that two\r\nkinds of the beautiful are distinguished--the sensuously-beautiful\r\nand the intellectually-beautiful. We feel those phenomena to be\r\nbeautiful, the sense-perception of which is accompanied by a feeling\r\nof pleasure--_e.g._, a particular colour, perhaps a pure red, or a\r\nharmony; nay, even a single note with its severally indistinguishable\r\nbut synchronous overtones. The researches of Helmholtz[309] and\r\nBlaserna[310] have thrown light on the cause of the feeling of\r\npleasure connected with certain acoustic perceptions, while those of\r\nBrücke[311] have led to similar results with regard to the mechanism\r\nof the feelings of pleasure following optical impressions. It is a\r\nquestion of discernment by the sensory nerves of definite simple\r\nnumerical relations in the vibrations of matter or of ether. We know\r\nless concerning the causes of the pleasures connected with smell\r\nand touch; yet here also it seems to be a question of more or less\r\nstrong impressions, hence equally of quantities--_i.e._, of numbers.\r\nThe ultimate cause of all these feelings is that certain modes of\r\nvibrations are in accord with the structure of the nerves, are easy for\r\nthem and leave them in order, while other modes disturb the arrangement\r\nof the nerve particles, often costing the nerves an effort, often\r\ndangerous to their existence or at least their functioning, to restore\r\nthem to their natural order. The former will be felt as pleasure, the\r\nlatter as discomfort, and even as pain. With the sensuously-beautiful\r\nthere can be no question of morality, for it exists as perception only,\r\nand does not rise to the rank of representation.\r\n\r\nAbove the sensuously-beautiful stands the intellectually-beautiful,\r\nno longer consisting of mere perceptions, but of representations, of\r\nconcepts and judgments, with their accompanying emotions elaborated in\r\nthe unconscious. The intellectually-beautiful must also awaken feelings\r\nof pleasure, to be perceived as beautiful; and, as above explained,\r\nwith feelings of pleasure are united, in healthy, fully-developed human\r\nbeings equipped with the social instinct (altruism), only those ideas\r\nthe content whereof is conducive to the existence and prosperity of the\r\nindividual being, society, or species. Now, that which is favourable\r\nto the life and prosperity of the individual and of the species is\r\nprecisely that which we call moral.\r\n\r\nFrom this it results by an iron necessity that a work which awakens no\r\nfeelings of pleasure cannot be beautiful, and that it can awaken no\r\nfeelings of pleasure if it is not moral, and we arrive at the final\r\nconclusion, that morality and beauty are in their innermost essence\r\nidentical. It were not false to assert that beauty is statical repose,\r\nand morality beauty in action.\r\n\r\nThis is only apparently contradicted by the fact that what is\r\nincontestably ugly and bad may also be agreeable, and hence awaken\r\nfeelings of pleasure. The mental process set up by percepts and ideas\r\nis not, in this case, so simple and direct as with respect to the\r\nbeautiful and the good. Associations sometimes of a highly complex\r\nnature must first be put into activity, finally, however, to lead to\r\nthe single great result, viz., the awakening of feelings of pleasure.\r\nThe well-known Aristotelian catharsis, purging or purification,\r\nexplains how tragedy, though it offers the spectacle of pain and ruin,\r\nfinally produces an agreeable effect. The representation of deserved\r\nmisfortune awakens ideas of justice, a moral, agreeable idea; and even\r\nthat of unmerited misfortune gives rise to pity, in itself a feeling\r\nof pain, though, in its quality of a racial instinct, beneficial\r\nand therefore not only moral, but, in its final essence, agreeable.\r\nWhen Valdez, in his famous picture of the _Caridad de Sevilla_,\r\nshows us an open coffin in which lies the corpse of an arch-bishop\r\nin full vestments, swarming with worms, this spectacle is in itself\r\nundeniably repulsive. Nevertheless it permits us at once to recognise\r\nthe emotion which the painter wished to express, viz., his feeling of\r\nthe nothingness of all earthly possessions and honours, the frailty\r\nof man in the face of the primeval power of Nature. It is the same\r\nemotion embodied by Holbein in his ‘Dance of Death,’ not so profoundly\r\nand passionately as by the Spaniard with his stronger feelings, but\r\nwith self-mockery and bitterness. The same emotion is heard, somewhat\r\nless gloomily and with more of a melancholy resignation, in Mozart’s\r\n_Requiem_. In the idea of the contrast between the insignificance of\r\nindividual life and the vastness and eternity of Nature, there mingles\r\nitself an element of the sublime, of which the idea, as the choicest\r\nform of activity in the highest brain-centres, is united with feelings\r\nof pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance in the plastic arts has to be considered. In works\r\nof sculpture and painting a broad separation is possible between the\r\nform and the content, between the sensuous and the moral. A painting,\r\na group, may represent the most immoral and most criminal incident;\r\nnevertheless, the individual constituent parts--the atmosphere, the\r\nharmonies of colour, the human figures--may be beautiful in themselves,\r\nand the connoisseur may derive enjoyment from them without dwelling on\r\nthe subject of the work. The engravings in the _Editions des fermiers\r\ngénéraux_ of the last century, the works in marble and bronze of the\r\npornographic museum at Naples, are, in a measure, repulsively immoral,\r\nbecause they represent unnatural vice. In themselves, however, they are\r\nexcellently executed, and are accessible to a mode of contemplation\r\nwhich disregards their idea and keeps in view only the perfection of\r\ntheir form. Here, therefore, the impression of the work of art is\r\na mixture of disgust for the subject treated, and enjoyment of the\r\nbeauty of the several figures and their attitudes--painted, drawn, or\r\nmodelled. The feeling of pleasure may preponderate, and the work, in\r\nspite of its depravity, produce, not a repellent, but an attractive\r\neffect. It is the same in nature. If that which is pernicious and\r\nfrightful is sometimes felt to be beautiful, it is because it contains\r\ncertain features and elements which have no cogent reference to the\r\nfrightful or pernicious character of the whole, and can hence in\r\nthemselves operate æsthetically. The hammer-headed viper is beautiful\r\non account of its metallic lustre; the tiger for its strength and\r\nsuppleness; the foxglove (_Digitalis_) for its graceful form and rich\r\nrosy hue. The noxiousness of the snake does not lie in its copper-red\r\ndorsal bands, nor the terribleness of the beast of prey in its\r\ngraceful appearance, nor the danger of the poisonous plant in the form\r\nand colour of its blossoms. In these cases the sensuously-beautiful\r\noutweighs the morally-repulsive, because it is more immediately\r\npresent, and, in the collective impression, allows the feelings of\r\npleasure to predominate. The spectacle of the display of strength and\r\nresolution is equally a beautiful one, on account of the ideas of\r\norganic efficiency awakened by it. Would this, however, be thought\r\nbeautiful if one could see how an assassin overpowers a victim who\r\nis resisting violently, hurls him to the ground and butchers him?\r\nCertainly not; for before such a picture it is no longer possible to\r\nseparate the display of strength, beautiful in itself, from its aim,\r\nand to enjoy the former regardless of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn poetry this separation of the form from the content is far less\r\npossible than in the plastic arts. The word can hardly in itself\r\nproduce an effect of sensuous beauty by its auditory or visual image,\r\neven if it presents itself rhythmically regulated and strengthened by\r\nthe more expressive double sound of a rhyme. It operates almost solely\r\nby its content, by the representations which it awakens. Hence it is\r\nhardly conceivable that one can hear or read a poetical exposition\r\nof criminal or vicious facts, without having present at each word a\r\nrepresentation of its content, and not of its form--_i.e._, of its\r\nsound. In this case, therefore, the impression can no longer be a\r\ncomposite one, as at the sight of a finely-painted portrayal of a\r\nrepulsive incident, but must be purely disagreeable. The pictures\r\nof Giulio Romano, to which Pietro Aretino dedicated his _Sonetti\r\nlussuriosi_, may be found beautiful by the admirers of the effeminate\r\nstyle of that pupil of Raphael; the sonnets are only the more\r\ndisgusting. Who would experience feelings of pleasure from the perusal\r\nof the writings of the Marquis de Sade, Andrea de Nercia or Liseux?\r\nOnly one species of human beings--that of the degenerate with perverted\r\ninstincts. Portrayals of crime and vice in art and literature have\r\ntheir public; that we well know. It is the public of the gaols. Besides\r\ndismally sentimental books, criminals read nothing so willingly as\r\nstories of lust and violence;[312] and the drawings and inscriptions\r\nwith which they cover the walls of their cells have, for the most\r\npart, their crimes as subjects.[313] But the healthy man feels himself\r\nviolently repelled by works of this kind, and it is impossible for him\r\nto receive an æsthetic impression from them, be their form never so\r\nconformable to the most approved rules of art.\r\n\r\nIn yet another case it is possible for that which is most ugly and\r\nvicious in artistic portrayal to operate in the direction of the\r\nmorally beautiful. This is when it allows us to recognise the moral\r\npurpose of the author and betrays his sympathetic emotion. For that\r\nwhich we, consciously or unconsciously, perceive behind every artistic\r\ncreation is the nature of its creator and the emotion from which it\r\nsprang, and our sympathy with, or antipathy for, the emotion of the\r\nauthor has the lion’s share in our appreciation of the work. When\r\nRaffaelli paints shockingly degraded absinthe-drinkers in the low\r\ndrinking dens of the purlieus of Paris, we clearly feel his profound\r\npity at the sight of these fallen human beings, and this emotion we\r\nexperience as a morally beautiful one. In like manner we have not a\r\nmomentary doubt of the morality of the artist’s emotions when we behold\r\nCallot’s pictures of the horrors of war, or the bleeding, purulent\r\nsaints of Zurbaran, or the monsters of Breughel van der Hölle, or\r\nwhen we read the murder scene in Dostojevsky’s _Raskolnikow_.[314]\r\nThese emotions are beautiful. Sympathy with them gives us a feeling\r\nof pleasure. Against this feeling the displeasure caused by the\r\nrepulsiveness of the work cannot prevail. When, however, the work\r\nbetrays the indifference of the author to the evil or ugliness he\r\ndepicts, nay, his predilection for it, then the abhorrence provoked\r\nby the work is intensified by all the disgust which the author’s\r\naberration of instinct inspires in us, and the aggregate impression is\r\none of keenest displeasure. Those who share the emotions of the author,\r\nand hence are with him attracted and pleasurably excited by what is\r\nrepugnant, diseased and evil, are the degenerate.\r\n\r\nThe Æsthetes affirm that artistic activity is the highest of which\r\nthe human mind is capable, and must occupy the first place in the\r\nestimation of men. How do they manage to establish this assertion from\r\ntheir own standpoint? Why should I place a high value on the activity\r\nof a fellow who with rapture describes the colours and odours of putrid\r\ncarrion; and why should I bestow my especial esteem on a painter who\r\nshows me the libidinousness of a harlot? Because the amount of artistic\r\ntechnique involved is difficult? If that is to be the decisive point,\r\nthen, to be logical, the Æsthetes must place the acrobat higher than\r\nthe artist of their species, since it is much more difficult to learn\r\nthe art of the trapezist than the rhyming and daubing which constitutes\r\nthe ‘art’ of the Æsthetes. Is it to be on account of sensations of\r\npleasure given by artists? First of all, those artists over whom the\r\nÆsthetes grow so enthusiastic create in the healthy man no pleasure,\r\nbut loathing or boredom. But granted that they do provide sensations,\r\nthe first inquiry must then be of what sort these sensations are.\r\nEvery sensation, even if we for the moment find it agreeable, does not\r\ninspire us with esteem for the person to whom we are indebted for it.\r\nAt the card-table, in the public-house and the brothel, a base nature\r\nmay procure sensations the intensity of which those offered by any work\r\nof the Æsthetes is far from being able to rival. But even the most\r\ndissolute drunkard does not in consequence hold the keepers of these\r\nplaces of his pleasures in specially high esteem.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the claim of the highest rank for art advanced by the\r\nÆsthetes involves the complete refutation of their other dogmas. The\r\nrace estimates individual activities according to their utility for the\r\nwhole. The higher this develops itself, the more exact and profound\r\nis the understanding it acquires of that which is really necessary\r\nand beneficial to it. The warrior, who in a low grade of civilization\r\nrightly plays the most prominent part, because society must live,\r\nand to this end must defend itself against its enemies, recedes to a\r\nmore humble position as manners become more gentle, and the relations\r\nbetween peoples cease to resemble those between beasts of prey, and\r\nassume a human character. Once the race has attained in some degree\r\nto a clear comprehension of its relation to nature, it knows that\r\nknowledge is its most important task, and its profoundest respect is\r\nfor those who cultivate and enlarge knowledge--_i.e._, for thinkers and\r\ninvestigators. Even in the monarchical state, which, conformably with\r\nits own atavistic nature, gauges the importance of the warrior by the\r\nstandard of primitive men (and in the present condition of Europe, in\r\nthe presence of the scarcely restrained fury for war, among a whole\r\nseries of nations, the _raison d’être_ for this atavism cannot, alas!\r\nbe contested), the scholar, as professor, academician, counsellor, is a\r\nconstituent part of the governmental machine, and honours and dignities\r\nfall far more to his lot than to the poet and artist. The enthusiasts\r\nof the latter are youths and women--_i.e._, those components of the\r\nrace in whom the unconscious outweighs consciousness; for artist and\r\npoet address themselves first of all to emotion, and this is more\r\neasily excited in the woman and the adolescent than in the mature man;\r\ntheir accomplishments are, moreover, more accessible to the multitude\r\nthan those of the scholar whom almost the best alone of his time can\r\nfollow, and whose importance is in general fully appreciated only by a\r\nfew specialists, even in our days of the popularization of science by\r\nthe press. State and society, however, seek to compensate him for the\r\nevasion of this reward, by surrounding him with official forms of high\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nIt is true that very great artists and poets, admitted pioneers, whose\r\ninfluence is recognised as lasting, likewise receive their share of the\r\nofficial honours disposed of by the organized commonwealth as such,\r\nand these exceptional men obtain a more brilliant reward than any\r\ninvestigator or discoverer; for together with the common distinctions\r\nshared by them with the latter, they possess the wide popularity which\r\nthe investigator and discoverer must dispense withal. And why is the\r\nartist sometimes placed, even by persons of good and serious minds, on\r\na level with, or even above, the man of science? Because these persons\r\nvalue the beautiful more than the true, emotion more than knowledge?\r\nNo; but because they have the right feeling that art is equally a\r\nsource of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is so in three ways. Firstly, the emotion evoked by the work of art\r\nis itself a means of obtaining knowledge, as Edmund R. Clay, James\r\nSully, and other psychologists have seen, without, however, dwelling\r\non the important fact. It constrains the higher centres to attend to\r\nthe causes of their excitations, and in this way necessarily induces a\r\nsharper observation and comprehension of the whole series of phenomena\r\nrelated to the emotion. Next, the work of art grants an insight into\r\nthe laws of which the phenomenon is the expression; for the artist, in\r\nhis creation, separates the essential from the accidental, neglects\r\nthe latter, which in nature is wont to divert and confuse the less\r\ngifted observer, and involuntarily gives prominence to the former as\r\nthat which chiefly or solely occupies his attention, and is therefore\r\nperceived and reproduced by him with especial distinctness. The\r\nartist himself divines the idea behind the structure, and its inner\r\nprinciple and connection, intelligible but not perceivable, in the\r\nform, and discloses it in his work to the spectator. That is what\r\nHegel means when he calls the beautiful ‘the presence of the idea\r\nin limited phenomenon.’ By means of his own deep comprehension of\r\nnatural law, the artist powerfully furthers the comprehension of it\r\nby other men.[315] Finally, art is the only glimmer of light, weak\r\nand dubious though it be, which projects itself into the future, and\r\ngives us at least a dream-like idea of the outlines and direction of\r\nour further organic developments. This is not mysticism, but a very\r\nclear and comprehensible fact. We have seen above[316] that every\r\nadaptation--_i.e._, every change of form and function of the organs--is\r\npreceded by a representation of this change. The change must first be\r\nfelt and desired as necessary; then a representation of it becomes\r\nelaborated in the higher or highest nerve-centres, and finally the\r\norganism endeavours to realize this representation. This process\r\nrepeats itself in the same way in the race. Some state is disturbing\r\nto it. It experiences feelings of discomfort from this state. It\r\nsuffers from it. From this results its desire to change the state. It\r\nelaborates for itself an image of the nature, direction and extent of\r\nthis change. According to the older, mystic phrase, ‘it creates for\r\nitself an ideal.’ The ideal is really the formative idea of future\r\norganic development with a view to better adaptation. In the most\r\nperfect individuals of the species it exists earlier and more distinct\r\nthan in the average multitude, and the artist ventures with uncertain\r\nhand to make it accessible to sense through the medium of his work\r\nof art long before it can be organically realized by the race. Thus\r\nart vouchsafes the most refined and highest knowledge, bordering on\r\nthe marvellous, viz., the knowledge of the future. Not so definitely,\r\nof course, nor so unequivocally, does art express the secret natural\r\nlaw of being and becoming as science. Science shows the present, the\r\npositive; Art prophesies the future, the possible, though stammeringly\r\nand obscurely. To the former Nature unveils her fixed forms; to the\r\nlatter she grants, amidst shudderings, a rapid, bewildered glimpse of\r\nthe depths where what is yet formless is struggling to appear. The\r\nemotion from which the divining work of art springs is the birth throe\r\nof the quick and vigorous organism pregnant with the future.[317]\r\n\r\nThis art of presentiment is certainly the highest mental activity of\r\nthe human being. But it is not the art of the Æsthetes. It is the most\r\nmoral art, for it is the most ideal, a word only meaning that it is\r\nparallel with the paths along which the race is perfecting itself--nay,\r\ncoincides with these.\r\n\r\nBy the most diverse methods we have always attained the same result,\r\nviz., it is not true that art has nothing in common with morality.\r\nThe work of art must be moral, for its aim is to express and excite\r\nemotions. In virtue of this aim it falls within the competence of\r\ncriticism, which tests all emotions by their utility or perniciousness\r\nto the individual or the race; and if it is immoral, it must be\r\ncondemned like every other organic activity opposed to this aim. The\r\nwork of art must be moral, for it is intended to operate æsthetically.\r\nIt can only do this if it awakens feelings of pleasure, at least\r\nultimately; it provides such, only if it includes beauty in itself; but\r\nbeauty is in its essence synonymous with morality. Finally, the highest\r\nwork of art can, from its inmost nature, be none other than moral,\r\nsince it is a manifestation of vital force and health, a revelation\r\nof the capacity for evolution of the race; and humanity values it so\r\nhighly because it divines this circumstance.\r\n\r\nConcerning the last doctrine of the Æsthetes, viz., that art must shun\r\nthe true and the natural, this is a commonplace pushed to an absurdity,\r\nand converted into its contrary. Perfect, actual truth and naturalness\r\nneed not be denied to art; they are impossible to it. For whereas\r\nthe work of art makes the artist’s idea tangible, an idea is never\r\nan exact copy of a phenomenon of the external world. Before it can\r\nbecome an idea in a human consciousness every phenomenon experiences\r\ntwo very essential modifications--one in the afferent and receptive\r\norgans of sense, the other in the centres elaborating sense-perceptions\r\ninto representations. These sensory nerves and centres of perception\r\nchange the modes of the external stimuli conformably with their own\r\nnature; they give to these their particular colouring, as different\r\nwind-instruments played by the same person give forth different\r\nshades of sound with the same force of breath. The centres forming\r\nrepresentations modify in their turn the actual relation of the\r\nphenomena to each other, in that they bring some into stronger relief,\r\nand neglect others of really equal value. Consciousness does not take\r\ncognizance of all the countless perceptions uninterruptedly excited\r\nin the brain, but of those only to which it is attentive. But by the\r\nsimple fact of attention, consciousness selects individual phenomena,\r\nand gives them an importance they do not possess in the unceasing\r\nuniformity of universal movement.\r\n\r\nBut if the work of art never renders reality in its exact relations,\r\nit can, on the other hand (and this is both a psychological and\r\næsthetical commonplace), never be constructed from constituents other\r\nthan those supplied by reality. The mode in which these constituents\r\nare blended and united by the artist’s imagination permits the\r\nrecognition of another fact, as true and natural as any that is\r\nhabitually designated by us as real, to wit, the character, mode of\r\nthought, and emotion of the artist. For what is imagination? A special\r\ncase of the general psychological law of association. In scientific\r\nobservation and judgment the play of association is most rigorously\r\nsupervised by attention; the will violently inhibits the propagation of\r\nstimuli along the most convenient paths, and prevents the penetration\r\nof mere similarities, contrasts, and contiguities in space or time\r\ninto consciousness, which is reserved for the images of immediate\r\nreality transmitted by the senses. In artistic creation imagination\r\nrules--that is to say, the inhibition exercised by the will is relaxed;\r\nin accordance with the laws of association a presentation is allowed\r\nto summon into consciousness representations which are similar,\r\ncontrasted, or contiguous in space or time. But inhibition is not\r\nwholly inactive, and the will does not permit the union of reciprocally\r\nexclusive representations into a concept; thus it prohibits the\r\nelaboration of an intellectual absurdity, such as is yielded by purely\r\nautomatic association or fugitive ideation. The emotion of the artist\r\nreveals itself in accordance with the way in which representations\r\nsupplied by association are grouped into concepts, for it causes\r\nrepresentations agreeing with it to be retained, and the indifferent or\r\ncontradictory to be suppressed. Even fantastic images, as extravagant\r\nas a winged horse or a woman with lion’s paws, reveal a true emotion:\r\nthe former an aspiration proceeding from the spectacle of the bird\r\nsoaring light and free; the latter a horror of the power of sexuality\r\nsubjugating reason and conjuring up devouring passion. It would be\r\na grateful task for workers in the histology of psychology to trace\r\nthe emotions whence the best known fantastic figures of art and the\r\nmetaphors of poets have proceeded. Hence it may be said that every work\r\nof art always comprises in itself truth and reality in so far as, if it\r\ndoes not reflect the external world, it surely reflects the mental life\r\nof the artist.\r\n\r\nHence, as we have seen, not one of the sophisms of the Æsthetes\r\nwithstands criticism. The work of art is not its own aim, but it has\r\na specially organic, and a social task. It is subject to the moral\r\nlaw; it must obey this; it has claim to esteem only if it is morally\r\nbeautiful and ideal. And it cannot be other than natural and true,\r\nin so far, at least, as it is the offprint of a personality, which\r\nis also a part of nature and reality. The entire system takes as its\r\npoint of departure a few erroneous or imprudent assertions of thinkers\r\nand poets commanding respect, but developed by the Parnassians and\r\nDecadents in a way of which Lessing, Kant and Schiller never allowed\r\nthemselves to dream. This is no other than the well-known attempt to\r\nexplain and justify impulsions by motives more or less obvious and\r\ninvented _post facto_. The degenerate who, in consequence of their\r\norganic aberrations, make the repulsive and ugly, vice and crime, the\r\nsubject-matter of plastic and literary works of art, naturally have\r\nrecourse to the theory that art has nothing in common with morality,\r\ntruth and beauty, since this theory has for them the value of an\r\nexcuse. And must not the excessive value set upon artistic activity\r\nas such, without regard to the worth of its results, be highly\r\nwelcome to the limitless crowd of imitators who practise art, not\r\nfrom an inner prompting, but from a foolhardy craving for the respect\r\nsurrounding real artists--imitators who have nothing of their own to\r\nsay, no emotion, not an idea, but who, with a superficial professional\r\ndexterity easily acquired, falsify the views and feelings of masters in\r\nall branches of art? This rabble, which claims for itself a top place\r\nin the scale of intellectual rank, and freedom from the constraint of\r\nall moral laws as its most noble privilege, is certainly baser than\r\nthe lowest scavenger. These creatures are of absolutely no use to the\r\ncommonwealth, and injure true art by their productions, whose multitude\r\nand importunateness shut out from most men the sight of the genuine\r\nworks of art--never very numerous--of the epoch. They are weaklings\r\nin will, unfitted for any activity requiring regular uniform efforts,\r\nor else victims to vanity, wishing to be more famous than is possible\r\nto a stone-breaker or a tailor. The uncertainty of comprehension and\r\ntaste among the majority of mankind, and the incompetency of most\r\nprofessional critics, allow these intruders to make their nest among\r\nthe arts, and to dwell there as parasites their life long. The buyer\r\nsoon distinguishes a good boot from a bad one, and the journeyman\r\ncobbler who cannot properly sew on a sole finds no employment. But that\r\na book or painting void of all originality is indifferent in quality,\r\nand for that reason superfluous, is by no means so easily recognised\r\nby the Philistine, or even by the man armed with the critical pen,\r\nand the producer of such chaff can apply himself undisturbed to his\r\nassiduous waste of time. These bunglers with pen, brush and modelling\r\nspattle, strutting about in cap and doublet, naturally swear by the\r\ndoctrine of the Æsthetes, carry themselves as if they were the salt of\r\nhumanity, and make a parade of their contempt for the Philistine. They\r\nbelong, however, to the elements of the race which are most inimical to\r\nsociety. Insensible to its tasks and interests, without the capacity\r\nto comprehend a serious thought or a fruitful deed, they dream only of\r\nthe satisfaction of their basest instincts, and are pernicious--through\r\nthe example they set as drones, as well as through the confusion they\r\ncause in minds insufficiently forewarned, by their abuse of the word\r\n‘art’ to mean demoralization and childishness. Ego-maniacs, Decadents\r\nand Æsthetes have completely gathered under their banner this refuse of\r\ncivilized peoples, and march at its head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIBSENISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the course of the last two centuries the whole civilized world\r\nhas, with greater or less unanimity, repeatedly recognised a sort of\r\nintellectual royalty in some contemporary, to whom it has rendered\r\nhomage as the first and greatest among living authors. For a great\r\npart of the eighteenth century Voltaire, ‘_le roi Voltaire_,’ was the\r\n‘poet laureate’ of all civilized nations. During the first third of the\r\npresent century this position was held by Goethe. After his death the\r\nthrone remained vacant for a score of years, when Victor Hugo ascended\r\nit amidst the enthusiastic acclamations of the Latin and Slavonic\r\nraces, and with a feeble opposition from those of Teutonic origin, to\r\nhold it until the end of his life.\r\n\r\nAt the present time voices have for some years been heard in all\r\ncountries claiming for Henrik Ibsen the highest intellectual honours\r\nat the disposal of mankind. It is wished that the Norwegian dramatist\r\nshould, in his old age, be recognised as the world-poet of the closing\r\ncentury. It is true that only a part of the multitude and of the\r\ncritical representatives of its taste acclaims him; but the fact that\r\nit has entered anyone’s mind at all to see in him a claimant for the\r\nthrone of poetry makes a minute examination of his titles to the\r\nposition necessary.\r\n\r\nThat Henrik Ibsen is a poet of great verve and power is not for a\r\nmoment to be denied. He is extraordinarily emotive, and has the gift\r\nof depicting in an exceptionally lifelike and impressive manner\r\nthat which has excited his feelings. (We shall see that these are\r\nalmost always feelings of hatred and rage, _i.e._, of displeasure.) A\r\nnatural capacity drew him towards the stage--a capacity for imagining\r\nsituations in which the characters are forced to turn inside out their\r\ninmost nature; in which abstract ideas transform themselves into deeds,\r\nand modes of opinion and of feeling, imperceptible to the senses, but\r\npotent as causes, are made patent to sight and hearing in attitudes and\r\ngestures, in the play of feature and in words. Like Richard Wagner, he\r\nknows how to group events into living frescoes possessing the charm of\r\nsignificant pictures; with this difference, however, that Ibsen works,\r\nnot like Wagner, with strange costumes and properties, architectural\r\nsplendour, mechanical magic, gods and fabulous beasts, but with\r\npenetrating vision into the backgrounds of souls and the conditions of\r\nhumanity. Fairy-lore is not lacking in Ibsen either, but he does not\r\nallow the imagination of the spectators to run riot in mere spectacles;\r\nhe forces them into moods, and binds them by his spell in circles of\r\nideas, through the pictures which he unrolls before them.\r\n\r\nHis strong desire to embody the thought occupying his mind in a single\r\npicture, which can be surveyed at one view, also dictated to him the\r\nset form of his drama--a form not invented, but largely perfected, by\r\nhim. His pieces are, as it were, final words terminating long anterior\r\ndevelopments. They are the sudden breaking into flame of combustible\r\nmaterials accumulating during years, it may be during whole human\r\nlives, or even generations, and of which the sudden flare brilliantly\r\nillumines a wide extent of time and space. The incidents of the\r\nIbsen drama more frequently take place in a day, or at most in twice\r\ntwenty-four hours, and in this short space of time there are concentred\r\nall the effects of the course of the world and of social institutions\r\non certain characters, in such a conspectus that the destinies of the\r\ndramatis personæ become clear to us from the moment of their first\r\nappearance. _The Doll’s House_, _Ghosts_, _Rosmersholm_, _The Pillars\r\nof Society_, and _Hedda Gabler_ comprise about twenty-four hours; _An\r\nEnemy of Society_, _The Wild Duck_, _The Lady from the Sea_, about\r\nthirty-six hours. It is the return to the Aristotelian doctrine of the\r\nunities of time and space with an orthodoxy compared with which the\r\nFrench classicists of the age of Louis XIV. are heretics. I might well\r\nterm the Ibsenite technique a technique of fireworks, for it consists\r\nin preparing long in advance a staging on which the suns, Roman\r\ncandles, squibs, fireballs and concluding fire-sheaves are carefully\r\nplaced in proper position. When all is ready the curtain rises, and the\r\nartistically-constructed work begins to crackle, explosion following\r\nexplosion uninterruptedly with thunder and lightning. This technique\r\nis certainly very effective, but hardly true. In reality events rarely\r\nlead up to a catastrophe so brilliant and succinct. In Nature all is\r\nslowly prepared, and unrolls itself gradually, and the results of\r\nhuman deeds covering years of time do not compress themselves into a\r\nfew hours. Nature does not work epigrammatically. She cannot trouble\r\nherself about Aristotelian unities, for she has always an infinity of\r\naffairs of her own in progress at one and the same time. As a matter of\r\nhandicraft, one is certainly often forced to admire the cleverness with\r\nwhich Ibsen guides and knots the threads of his plot. Sometimes the\r\nlabour is more successful than at other times, but it always implies a\r\ngreat expenditure of textile skill. Whoever sets most store on truth in\r\na poem--that is, on the natural action of the laws of life--will often\r\nenough bring away from Ibsen’s dramas an impression of improbability,\r\nand of toilsome and subtle lucubrations.\r\n\r\nThe power with which Ibsen, in a few rapid strokes, sketches a\r\nsituation, an emotion, a dim-lit depth of the soul, is very much higher\r\nthan his skill, so much extolled, of foreshortening in time, which\r\nmay be said to be the poetic counterpart of the painter’s artifice\r\n(difficult, but for the most part barren) of foreshortening in space.\r\nEach of the terse words which suffice him has something of the nature\r\nof a peep-hole, through which limitless vistas are obtained. The\r\nplays of all peoples and all ages have few situations at once so\r\nperfectly simple and so irresistibly affecting as the scenes--to cite\r\nonly a few--where Nora is playing with her children,[318] where Dr.\r\nRank relates that he is doomed to imminent death by his inexorable\r\ndisease,[319] where Frau Alving with horror discerns his dissolute\r\nfather[320] in her only son, where the housekeeper, Frau Helseth, sees\r\nRosmer and Rebecca die in each other’s arms,[321] etc.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it must be acknowledged that Ibsen has created some\r\ncharacters possessing a truth to life and a completeness such\r\nas are not to be met with in any poet since Shakespeare. Gina\r\n(in _The Wild Duck_) is one of the most profound creations of\r\nworld-literature--almost as great as Sancho Panza, who inspired it.\r\nIbsen has had the daring to create a female Sancho, and in his temerity\r\nhas come very near to Cervantes, whom no one has equalled. If Gina is\r\nnot quite so overpowering as Sancho, it is because there is wanting\r\nin her his contrast to Don Quixote. Her Don Quixote, Hjalmar, is no\r\ngenuine, convinced idealist, but merely a miserable self-deluding\r\nburlesquer of the ideal. None the less, no poet since the illustrious\r\nSpanish master has succeeded in creating such an embodiment of plain,\r\njolly, healthy common-sense, of practical tact without anxiety as to\r\nthings eternal, and of honest fulfilment of all proximate, obvious\r\nduties, without a suspicion of higher moral obligations, as this Gina,\r\n_e.g._, in the scene where Hjalmar returns home after having spent the\r\nnight out.[322] Hjalmar also is a perfect creation, in which Ibsen\r\nhas not once succumbed to the cogent temptation to exaggerate, but\r\nhas exercised most entrancingly that ‘self-restraint’ in every word\r\nwhich, as Goethe said, ‘reveals the master.’ Little Hedwig (again in\r\n_The Wild Duck_), the aunt Juliane Tesman (in _Hedda Gabler_), perhaps\r\nalso the childishly egoistical consumptive Lyngstrand (in _The Lady\r\nfrom the Sea_), are not inferior to these characters. It should,\r\nhowever, be noticed that, with the exception of Gina, Hjalmar and\r\nHedwig, the lifelike and artistically delightful persons in Ibsen’s\r\ndramas never play the chief parts, but move in subordinate tasks\r\naround the central figures. The latter are not human beings of flesh\r\nand blood, but abstractions such as are evoked by a morbidly-excited\r\nbrain. They are attempts at the embodiment of Ibsenite doctrines,\r\n_homunculi_, originating not from natural procreation, but through the\r\nblack art of the poet. This is even admitted, although reluctantly and\r\nwith reservation, by one of his most raving panegyrists, the French\r\nprofessor, Auguste Ehrhard.[323] Doubtless Ibsen takes immense pains\r\nto rouge and powder into a semblance of life the talking puppets who\r\nare to represent his notions. He appends to them all sorts of little\r\npeculiarities for the purpose of giving them an individual physiognomy.\r\nBut this perpetually recurring imbecile ‘Eh?’ of Tesman[324] (in _Hedda\r\nGabler_), this ‘dash it all!’ and stealthy nibbling of sweetmeats by\r\nNora[325] (in _A Doll’s House_), this ‘smoking a large meerschaum’ and\r\nchampagne-drinking of Oswald (in _Ghosts_), do not delude the attentive\r\nobserver as to their being anything but automata. In spite of the\r\npoet’s artifices, one sees, behind the thin varnish of flesh-colour,\r\nthe hinges and joints of the mechanism, and hears, above the tones of\r\nthe phonographs concealed in them, the creaking and grating of the\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to do justice to the high poetical endowment of\r\nIbsen, and shall sometimes be able in the course of this inquiry to\r\nrecognise this gift again. Is it this, however, which alone or chiefly\r\nhas gained for him his admirers in all lands? Do his retinue of fifers\r\nand bagpipers prize him for his homely emotional scenes, and for his\r\ntruly lifelike accessory figures? No. They glorify something else\r\nin him. They discover in his pieces world-pictures of the greatest\r\ntruth, the happiest poetic use of scientific methods, clearness and\r\nincisiveness of ideas, a fiercely revolutionary desire for freedom,\r\nand a modernity pregnant with the future. Now we will test and examine\r\nthese affirmations _seriatim_, and see if they can be supported\r\nby Ibsen’s works, or are merely the arbitrary and undemonstrable\r\nexpressions of æsthetic wind-bags.\r\n\r\nIt is pretended that Ibsen is before all things exemplary in\r\ntruthfulness. He has even become the model of ‘realism.’ As a matter of\r\nfact, since Alexandre Dumas père, author of _The Three Musketeers_ and\r\n_Monte Cristo_, no writer has heaped up in his works so many startling\r\nimprobabilities as Ibsen. (I say improbabilities, because I dare not\r\nsay impossibilities; for, after all, everything is possible as the\r\nunheard-of exploit of some fool, or as the extraordinary effect of\r\na unique accident.) Is it conceivable that (in _Ghosts_) the joiner\r\nEngstrand, wishing to open a tavern for sailors, should call upon\r\nhis own daughter to be the odalisque of his ‘establishment’--this\r\ndaughter who reminds him that she has been ‘brought up in the house of\r\nMadam Alving, widow of a lord-in-waiting,’ that she has been treated\r\n‘almost as a child of the house’? Not that I imagine Engstrand to be\r\npossessed of any moral scruples. But a man of this stamp knows that\r\none woman does not suffice for his house; and since he must engage\r\nothers, he would certainly not turn to his daughter, bred as she\r\nwas in the midst of higher habits of life, and knowing that, if she\r\nwishes to lead a life of pleasure, it would not be necessary to become\r\nstraightway a prostitute for sailors. Is it conceivable that Pastor\r\nManders (_Ghosts_), a liberally educated clergyman in the Norway of\r\nto-day, a country of flourishing insurance companies, banks, railways,\r\nprosperous newspapers, etc., should dissuade Madam Alving from insuring\r\nagainst fire the asylum she had just founded? ‘For my own part,’ he\r\nsays, ‘I should not see the smallest impropriety in guarding against\r\nall contingencies.... I mean [by really responsible people] men in such\r\nindependent and influential positions that one cannot help allowing\r\nsome weight to their opinions.... People would be only too ready to\r\ninterpret our action as a sign that neither you nor I had the right\r\nfaith in a Higher Providence.’ Does Ibsen really wish to make anyone\r\nbelieve that in Norway there are persons who have religious scruples\r\nconcerning insurance against fire? Has not this nonsensical idea come\r\ninto his head simply because he wishes to have the asylum burned down\r\nand finally destroyed? For this purpose Madam Alving must have no money\r\nto rebuild the asylum, it must not be insured, and hence Ibsen thought\r\nit necessary to assign a motive for the omission of the insurance. A\r\npoet who introduces a fire into his work, as a symbol and also as an\r\nactive agent--for it has the dramatic purpose of destroying the lying\r\nreputation for charity of the defunct sinner Alving--should also have\r\nthe courage to leave unexplained the omission of the insurance, strange\r\nas it may seem. Oswald Alving relates to his mother (_Ghosts_) that a\r\nParis doctor on examining him had told him he had a ‘kind of softening\r\nof the brain.’ Now, I appeal to all the doctors of the world if they\r\nhave ever said plainly to a patient, ‘You have softening of the brain.’\r\nTo the family it perhaps may be revealed, to the patient never. Chiefly\r\nbecause, if the diagnosis be correct, the invalid would not understand\r\nthe remark, and would certainly no longer be in a fit state to go alone\r\nto the doctor. But for yet another reason these words are impossible.\r\nIn any case, Oswald’s disease could not have been a softening, but a\r\nhardening, a callous, sclerotic condition of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn _A Doll’s House_ Helmer, who is depicted as somewhat sensual,\r\nalthough prosaic, homely, practical, and commonplace, says to his\r\nNora: ‘Is that my lark who is twittering outside there?... Is the\r\nlittle squirrel running about?... Has my little spendthrift bird been\r\nwasting more money?... Come, come; my lark must not let her wings\r\ndroop immediately.... What do people call the bird who always spends\r\neverything?... My lark is the dearest little thing in the world; but\r\nshe needs a very great deal of money.... And I couldn’t wish you to be\r\nanything but exactly what you are--my own true little lark....’ And\r\nit is thus that a husband, a bank director and barrister, after eight\r\nyears of married life, speaks to his wife, the mother of his three\r\nchildren; and not in a momentary outburst of playful affection, but\r\nin the full light of an ordinary day, and in an interminable scene\r\nof seven pages (pp. 2-8), with a view to giving us an idea of the\r\nhabitually prevalent tone in this ‘doll’s home!’ I should much like to\r\nknow what my readers of both sexes who have been married at least eight\r\nyears think of this specimen of Ibsen’s ‘realism.’\r\n\r\nIn _The Pillars of Society_ all the characters talk about ‘society.’\r\n‘You are to rise and support society, brother-in-law,’ says Miss\r\nHessel, ‘earnestly and with emphasis.’ ‘If you strike this blow, you\r\nruin me utterly, and not only me, but also a great and blessed future\r\nfor the community which was the home of your childhood.’ And a little\r\nfurther on: ‘See, this I have dared for the good of the community!...\r\nDon’t you see that it is society itself that forces us into these\r\nsubterfuges?’ The persons thus holding forth are a wholesale merchant\r\nand consul, and a school-mistress who has long resided in America, and\r\nhas broad views. Can the word ‘society’ in the mouth of cultivated\r\npeople, when so used, have any other meaning than ‘social edifice?’\r\nWell, but the characters in the piece, as it is again and again\r\nrepeated, employ the word ‘society’ in reference to the well-to-do\r\nclasses in a small seaside place in Norway--that is, to a clique of six\r\nor eight families! Ibsen makes the readers of his piece believe that\r\nit is a question of upholding the social edifice, and they learn with\r\nastonishment that this only concerns the protection of a diminutive\r\ncoterie of Philistines in a northern Gotham.\r\n\r\nThe American ship _Indian Girl_ is undergoing repairs in Consul\r\nBernick’s dock. Her hull is quite rotten. If she is sent to sea she\r\nwill assuredly founder. Bernick, however, insists that she shall sail\r\nin two days. His foreman Aune pronounces this impossible. Then Bernick\r\nthreatens Aune with dismissal, at which the latter yields, and promises\r\nthat ‘in two days the _Indian Girl_ will be ready to sail.’ Bernick\r\nknows that he is sending the _Indian Girl’s_ crew of eighteen men to\r\ncertain death. And why does he commit this wholesale murder? He gives\r\nthe following explanation: ‘I have my reasons for hurrying on the\r\naffair. Have you read this morning’s paper? Ah! then you know that the\r\nAmericans have been making disturbances again. The shameless pack put\r\nthe whole town topsy-turvy. Not a night passes without fights in the\r\ntaverns or on the street, not to speak of other abominations.... And\r\nwho gets the blame for all this disturbance? It is I--yes, I--that\r\nsuffer for it. These newspaper scribblers are always covertly carping\r\nat us for giving our whole attention to the _Palm Tree_. And I, whose\r\nmission it is to be an example to my fellow-citizens, must have such\r\nthings thrown in my teeth! I cannot bear it. It won’t do for me to have\r\nmy name bespattered in this way.... Not just now; precisely at this\r\nmoment I need all the respect and good-will of my fellow-citizens.\r\nI have a great undertaking on hand, as you have probably heard; but\r\nif evil-disposed persons succeed in shaking people’s unqualified\r\nconfidence in me, it may involve me in the greatest difficulties. So\r\nI must silence these carping and spiteful scribblers at any price,\r\nand that is why I give you till the day after to-morrow.’ This paltry\r\nmotive for the coldly-planned murder of eighteen men is so ridiculous\r\nthat even Ehrhard, who admires everything in Ibsen, dares not defend\r\nit, and timidly remarks that ‘the author does not very well explain why\r\nthe anxiety for his reputation should require the sending to sea of a\r\nvessel which he has not had time thoroughly to repair.’[326]\r\n\r\nAt the head of a delegation of his fellow-citizens, sent to thank\r\nhim for the establishment of a railway, Pastor Rörlund delivers an\r\naddress to Bernick in which the following passages occur: ‘We have\r\noften expressed to you our gratitude for the broad moral foundation\r\nupon which you have, so to speak, built up our society. This time we\r\nchiefly hail in you the ... citizen, who has taken the initiative in\r\nan undertaking which, we are credibly assured, will give a powerful\r\nimpetus to the temporal prosperity and well-being of the community....\r\nYou are in an eminent sense the pillar and corner-stone of this\r\ncommunity.... And it is just this light of disinterestedness shining\r\nover all your actions that is so unspeakably beneficent, especially in\r\nthese times. You are now on the point of procuring for us--I do not\r\nhesitate to say the word plainly and prosaically--a railway.... But\r\nyou cannot reject a slight token of your grateful fellow-citizens’\r\nappreciation, least of all on this momentous occasion, when, according\r\nto the assurances of practical men, we are standing on the threshold\r\nof a new era.’ I have not interrupted by a single remark or note\r\nof exclamation this unheard-of balderdash. It shall produce its\r\nown unaided effect upon the reader. If this nonsense appeared in\r\na burlesque farce, it would be hardly funny enough, but otherwise\r\nacceptable. Now, this claims to be ‘realistic’! We are to take Ibsen’s\r\nword for it that Pastor Rörlund was sober when he made this speech! A\r\nmore insulting demand has never been made by an author on his readers.\r\n\r\nIn _An Enemy of Society_ the subject treats of a rather\r\nincomprehensible bathing establishment, comprising at once mineral\r\nwaters, medicinal baths and sea-bathing. The doctor of the\r\nestablishment has discovered that the springs are contaminated with\r\ntyphoid bacilli, and insists that the water shall be taken from a place\r\nhigher up in the mountains, where it would not be polluted by sewage.\r\nHe is the more urgent in his demands, as without this precaution a\r\nfatal epidemic will break out among the visitors. And to this the\r\nburgomaster of the town is supposed to reply: ‘The existing supply\r\nof water for the baths is once for all a fact, and must naturally be\r\ntreated as such. But probably the directors, at some future time, will\r\nnot be indisposed to take into their consideration whether, by making\r\ncertain pecuniary sacrifices, it may not be possible to introduce some\r\nimprovements.’ This is a question of a place which, as Ibsen insists,\r\nhas staked its future on the development of its youthful bathing\r\nestablishment; the place is situated in Norway, in a small district\r\nwhere all the inhabitants are mutually acquainted, and where every\r\ncase of illness and death is noticed by all. And the burgomaster will\r\nrun the risk of having a number of the visitors at the establishment\r\nattacked with typhoid, when he is forewarned that this will certainly\r\nhappen if the conduit pipes of the spring are not transferred. Without\r\nhaving an exaggeratedly high opinion of the burgomaster mind in\r\ngeneral, I deny that any idiot such as Ibsen depicts is at the head of\r\nthe local administration of any town whatsoever in Europe.\r\n\r\nTesman, in _Hedda Gabler_, expects that his publication, _Domestic\r\nIndustries of Brabant during the Middle Ages_, will secure him a\r\nprofessorship in a college. But he has a dangerous competitor in\r\nEjlert Lövborg, who has published a book on _The General March of\r\nCivilization_. This work has already made a ‘great sensation,’ but the\r\nsequel is far to surpass this, and ‘treats of the future.’ ‘But, good\r\ngracious! we don’t know anything about that!’ someone objects. ‘No; but\r\nthere are several things though can be said about it, all the same....\r\nIt is divided into two sections. The first is about the civilizing\r\nforces of the future, and the other is about the civilizing progress\r\nof the future.’ Special stress is laid upon the fact that it lies\r\nwholly outside the domain of science, and consists in mere prophecy.\r\n‘Do you believe it impossible to reproduce such a work--that it cannot\r\nbe written a second time? No.... For the inspiration, you know....’ We\r\nare acquainted, were it only through popular histories of morals such\r\nas the _Democritus_ of Karl Julius Weber, with the strange questions\r\nwith which the casuists of the Middle Ages used to occupy themselves.\r\nBut that, in our century, such works as those of Tesman and Lövborg\r\ncould gain for their authors a professorship of any kind in either\r\nhemisphere, or even the position of _privat docent_, is an infantile\r\ninvention, fit to raise a laugh in all academical circles.\r\n\r\nIn _The Lady from the Sea_ the mysterious sailor returns to find that\r\nhis old sweetheart has been for some years the wife of Dr. Wangel. He\r\nurges her to follow him, saying she really belongs to him. The husband\r\nis present at the interview. He shows the stranger that he is wrong in\r\nwishing to carry off Ellida. He represents to the sailor that it would\r\nbe preferable if he addressed himself to him (the husband), and not\r\nto the wife. He mildly remonstrates with the stranger for addressing\r\nEllida with the familiar ‘thou,’ and calling her by her Christian\r\nname. ‘Such a familiarity is not customary with us, sir.’ The scene is\r\nunspeakably comic, and would be worthy of reproduction in its entirety.\r\nWe will limit ourselves to quoting the conclusion:--\r\n\r\n STRANGER. To-morrow night I will come again, and then I shall look\r\n for you here. You must wait for me here in the garden, for I prefer\r\n settling the matter with you alone. You understand?\r\n\r\n ELLIDA (_in low, trembling tone_). Do you hear that, Wangel?\r\n\r\n WANGEL. Only keep calm. We shall know how to prevent this visit.\r\n\r\n STRANGER. Good-bye for the present, Ellida. So to-morrow night----\r\n\r\n ELLIDA (_imploringly_). Oh, no, no! Do not come to-morrow night! Never\r\n come here again!\r\n\r\n STRANGER. And should you, then, have a mind to follow me over seas?\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. Oh, don’t look at me like that!\r\n\r\n STRANGER. I only mean that you must then be ready to set out.\r\n\r\n WANGEL. Go up to the house, Ellida, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd Ibsen depicts Wangel, not as a senile, debile old man, but in the\r\nprime of life and in full possession of all his faculties!\r\n\r\nAll these crack-brained episodes are, however, far surpassed by the\r\nscene in _Rosmersholm_, where Rebecca confesses to the doughty Rosmer\r\nthat she is consumed by ardent passion for him:--\r\n\r\n ROSMER. What have you felt? Speak so that I can understand you.\r\n\r\n REBECCA. It came over me--this wild, uncontrollable desire--oh, Rosmer!\r\n\r\n ROSMER. Desire? You! For what?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. For you.\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_tries to spring up_). What is this? [Idiot!]\r\n\r\n REBECCA (_stops him_). Sit still, dear; there is more to tell.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. And you mean to say--that you love me--in that way?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. I thought that it should be called love. Yes, I thought\r\n it was love; but it was not. It was what I said. It was a wild,\r\n uncontrollable desire.... It came upon me like a storm on the sea.\r\n It was like one of the storms we sometimes have in the North in the\r\n winter-time. It seizes you--and sweeps you along with it--whither it\r\n will. Resistance is out of the question.’\r\n\r\nRosmer, the object of this burning passion, is forty-three years\r\nold, and has been a clergyman. This makes it somewhat droll, but not\r\nimpossible, for erotomaniacs can love all sorts of creatures, even\r\nboots.[327] What, however, is inconceivable is the way in which the\r\nnymphomaniac sets about satisfying her ‘wild, uncontrollable desire,’\r\nthis ‘storm upon the sea’ which ‘seizes you, and sweeps you along\r\nwith it.’ She had become the friend of Rosmer’s sickly wife, and had\r\nfor eighteen months tormented her by hinting that Rosmer is unhappy\r\nbecause she has no children, that he loves her, the nymphomaniac, but\r\nhas controlled his passion as long as his wife is living. By means of\r\nthis poison, patiently and unceasingly dropped into her soul, she had\r\nhappily driven her to suicide. After a year and a half! To appease her\r\n‘wild, uncontrollable passion’! This is exactly as if a man driven wild\r\nby hunger should, with a view to satisfying his craving, devise a deep\r\nplan for obtaining a field by fraud, so that he might grow wheat, have\r\nit ground, and afterwards bake himself a splendid loaf, which would\r\nthen be Oh, so delicious! The reader may judge for himself if this is\r\nthe usual way in which famished persons, or nymphomaniacs over whom\r\npassion ‘sweeps like a storm upon the sea,’ satisfy their impulses.\r\n\r\nSuch are the presentations of the world’s realities as figured to\r\nhimself by this ‘realist’! Many of his infantile or silly lucubrations\r\nare petty, superficial details, and a benevolent friend, with\r\nsome experience of life and some common-sense, could easily have\r\npreserved him in advance from making himself ridiculous. Others of\r\nhis inventions, however, touch the very essence of his poems and\r\nconvert these into out and out grotesque moonshine. In _The Pillars of\r\nSociety_, Bernick, the man who calmly plans the murder of eighteen men\r\nto maintain his reputation as a capable dock-owner (we may remark, in\r\npassing, the absurdity of this means for attaining such an end), all\r\nat once confesses to his fellow-citizens, without any compulsion, and\r\nsolely on the advice of Miss Hessel, that he has been a villain and a\r\ncriminal. In _A Doll’s House_, the wife, who was only a moment before\r\nplaying so tenderly with her children, suddenly abandons these children\r\nwithout a thought for them.[328] In _Rosmersholm_ we are to believe\r\nthat the nymphomaniac Rebecca, while in constant intercourse with the\r\nobject of her flame, has become chaste and virtuous, etc. Many of\r\nIbsen’s principal characters present this spectacle of impossible and\r\nincomprehensible metamorphoses, so that they look like figures composed\r\nof odd halves, which some bungling artisan has stuck together.\r\n\r\nAfter the lifelike truthfulness of Ibsen, let us inquire into the\r\nscientific character of his work. This reminds us of the civilization\r\nof Liberian negroes. The constitution and laws of that West African\r\nrepublic read very much like those of the United States of North\r\nAmerica, and on paper command our respect. But anyone living in Liberia\r\nvery soon recognises the fact that these black republicans are savages,\r\nhaving no idea of the political institutions nominally existing\r\namong them, of their code of laws, etc. Ibsen likes to give himself\r\nthe appearance of standing in the domain of natural science and of\r\nprofiting by its latest results. In his plays Darwin is quoted. He has\r\nevidently dipped, though with a careless hand, into books on heredity,\r\nand has picked up something about medical science. But the scanty,\r\nludicrously misunderstood stock phrases which have remained in his\r\nmemory are made use of by him much as my illustrative Liberian negro\r\nuses the respectable paper collars and top-hats of Europe. The expert\r\ncan never preserve his gravity when Ibsen displays his scientific and\r\nmedical knowledge.\r\n\r\nHeredity is his hobby-horse, which he mounts in every one of his\r\npieces. There is not a single trait in his personages, a single\r\npeculiarity of character, a single disease, that he does not trace\r\nto heredity. In _A Doll’s House_, Dr. Rank’s ‘poor innocent spine\r\nmust do penance for “his” father’s notions of amusement when he was\r\na lieutenant in the army.’ Helmer explains to Nora that ‘a misty\r\natmosphere of lying brings contagion into the whole family. Every\r\nbreath the children draw contains some germ of evil.... Nearly all\r\nmen who go to ruin early have had untruthful mothers.... In most\r\ncases it comes from the mother; but the father naturally works in the\r\nsame direction.’ And again: ‘Your father’s low principles you have\r\ninherited, every one of them. No religion, no morality, no sense of\r\nduty.’ In _Ghosts_ Oswald has learned from the extraordinary doctor in\r\nParis who told him he had softening of the brain, that he had inherited\r\nhis malady from his father.[329] Regina, the natural daughter of the\r\nlate Alving, exactly resembles her mother.\r\n\r\n REGINA (_to herself_). So mother was that kind of woman, after all.\r\n\r\n MRS. ALVING. Your mother had many good qualities, Regina.\r\n\r\n REGINA. Yes; but she was one of that sort, all the same. Oh! I’ve\r\n often suspected it.... A poor girl must make the best of her young\r\n days.... And I, too, want to enjoy my life, Mrs. Alving.\r\n\r\n MRS. ALVING. Yes, I see you do. But don’t throw yourself away, Regina.\r\n\r\n REGINA. Oh! what must be, must be. If Oswald takes after his father, I\r\n take after my mother, I dare say.\r\n\r\nIn _Rosmersholm_ Rebecca’s nymphomania is explained by the fact that\r\nshe is the natural daughter of a Lapland woman of doubtful morals. ‘I\r\nbelieve your whole conduct is determined by your origin,’ Rector Kroll\r\nsays to her (p. 82). Rosmer never laughs, because ‘it is a trait of his\r\nfamily.’ He is ‘the descendant of the men that look down on us from\r\nthese walls’ (p. 80). His ‘spirit is deeply rooted in his ancestry’\r\n(p. 80). Hilda, the stepdaughter of the ‘Lady from the Sea,’ says:\r\n‘I should not wonder if some fine day she went mad.... Her mother\r\nwent mad, too. She died mad. I know that.’ In _The Wild Duck_ nearly\r\neveryone has a hereditary mark. Gregers Werle, the malignant imbecile,\r\nwho holds and proclaims his passion for gossip as an ardent desire for\r\ntruth, inherits this craze from his mother.[330] Little Hedwig becomes\r\nblind, like her father, old Werle.[331]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier philosophical dramas the same idea is constantly\r\nrepeated. Brand gets his obstinacy, and Peer Gynt his lively,\r\nextravagant imagination, from the mother. Ibsen has evidently read\r\nLucas’s book on the first principles of heredity, and has borrowed from\r\nit uncritically. It is true that Lucas believes in the inheritance even\r\nof notions and feelings as complex and as nearly related to specific\r\nfacts as, _e.g._, the horror of doctors,[332] and that he does not\r\ndoubt the transmission of diseased deviations from the norm, _e.g._,\r\nthe appearance of blindness at a definite age.[333] Lucas, however,\r\nwhose merits are not to be denied, did not sufficiently distinguish\r\nbetween that which the individual receives in its material genesis\r\nfrom its parents, and that which is subsequently suggested by family\r\nlife and example, by continuous existence in the same conditions as\r\nits parents, etc. Ibsen is the true ‘man of one book.’ He abides by\r\nhis Lucas. If he had read Weismann,[334] and, above all, Galton,[335]\r\nhe would have known that nothing is more obscure and apparently more\r\ncapricious, than the course of heredity. For the individual is, says\r\nGalton, the result--the arithmetic mean--of three different quantities:\r\nits father, its mother and the whole species, represented by the double\r\nseries, going back to the beginnings of all terrestrial life, of its\r\npaternal and maternal progenitors. This third datum is the unknown\r\nquantity--the _x_--in the problem. Reversions to distant ancestors may\r\nmake the individual wholly unlike its parents, and the influence of\r\nthe species so far exceed, as a general rule, those of the immediate\r\nprogenitors that children who are the exact cast of their father or\r\nmother, especially with respect to the most complex manifestations\r\nof personality, of character, capacities and inclinations, are the\r\ngreatest rarities. But Ibsen is not at all concerned about seriously\r\njustifying his ideas on heredity in a scientific manner. As we shall\r\nsee later on, these ideas have their root in his mysticism; Lucas’s\r\nwork was for him only a lucky treasure-trove, which he seized on with\r\njoy, because it offered him the possibility of scientifically cloaking\r\nhis mystic obsession.\r\n\r\nIbsen’s excursions in the domain of medical science, which he hardly\r\never denies himself, are most delightful. In _The Pillars of Society_\r\nRector Rörlund glorifies the women of his côterie as a kind of ‘sisters\r\nof mercy who pick lint.’ Pick lint! In an age of antiseptics and\r\naseptics! Let Ibsen only take into his head to enter any surgical ward\r\nwith his ‘picked lint’! He would be astonished at the reception given\r\nto him and his lint. In _An Enemy of Society_ Dr. Stockmann declares\r\nthat the water of the baths with its ‘millions of bacilli is absolutely\r\ninjurious to health, whether used internally or externally.’ The only\r\nbacilli which can be referred to in this scene, as throughout the whole\r\npiece, are the typhoid bacilli of Eberth. Now, it may be true that\r\nbathing in contaminated water may produce Biskra boils, and perhaps\r\nbéri-béri; but it would be difficult for Dr. Stockmann and Ibsen to\r\ninstance a single case of typhoid fever contracted through bathing in\r\nwater containing bacilli. In _A Doll’s House_ Helmer’s life ‘depended\r\non a journey abroad.’ That might be true for a European in the tropics,\r\nor for anyone living in a fever-district. But in Norway there is no\r\nsuch thing as an acute illness in which the life of the invalid depends\r\non ‘a journey abroad.’ Further on Dr. Rank says (p. 60): ‘In the last\r\nfew days I have had a general stock-taking of my inner man. Bankruptcy!\r\nBefore a month is over I shall be food for worms in the churchyard....\r\nThere is only one more investigation to be made, and when I have made\r\nit I shall know exactly at what time dissolution will take place.’\r\nAccording to his own declaration, Dr. Rank suffers from disease of\r\nthe dorsal marrow (it is true that he speaks of the dorsal column,\r\nbut the mistaken expression need not be taken too rigidly). Ibsen is\r\nevidently thinking of consumption of the spinal marrow. Now, there\r\nis in this disease absolutely no symptom which could with certainty\r\nauthorize the prediction of death three weeks beforehand; there is\r\nno ‘general stock-taking of the inner man’ which the invalid, if he\r\nwere a doctor, could carry out on himself to gain a clear knowledge\r\nof ‘when the dissolution’ was to take place; and there is no form of\r\nconsumption of the spinal marrow which would allow the invalid four\r\nweeks before his death (not an accidental death, but one necessitated\r\nby his disease) to go to a ball, drink immoderately of champagne, and\r\nafterwards to take an affecting leave of his friends. Oswald Alving’s\r\nillness in _Ghosts_ is, from a clinical standpoint, quite as childishly\r\ndepicted as that of Rank. From all that is said in the piece the\r\ndisease inherited by Oswald from his father can only be diagnosed\r\neither as _syphilis hereditaria tarda_, or _dementia paralytica_.\r\nThe first of these diseases is out of the question, for Oswald is\r\ndepicted as a model of manly strength and health.[336] And even if,\r\nin exceptional and extremely rare cases, the malady does not show\r\nitself till after the victim is well on in his twenties, it yet betrays\r\nitself from the earliest childhood by certain phenomena of degeneracy\r\nwhich would prevent even a mother, blinded by love and pride, from\r\nglorifying her son’s ‘outer self’ in the style of Mrs. Alving. Certain\r\nminor features might perhaps indicate _dementia paralytica_, as, for\r\nexample, Oswald’s sensual excitability, the artless freedom with which\r\nhe speaks before his mother of the amours of his friends in Paris, or\r\ngives expression to his pleasure at the sight of the ‘glorious’ Regina,\r\nthe levity with which, at the first sight of this girl, he makes plans\r\nfor his marriage, etc.[337] But together with these exact, though\r\nsubordinate, features there appear others infinitely more important,\r\nwhich wholly preclude the diagnosis of _dementia paralytica_. There\r\nis in Oswald no trace of the megalomania which is never absent in\r\nthe first stage of this malady; he is anxious and depressed, while\r\nthe sufferer from general paralysis feels extremely happy, and sees\r\nlife through rose-coloured spectacles. Oswald forebodes and dreads an\r\noutburst of madness--a fact which I, for my part, have never observed\r\nin a paralytic, nor found indicated by any clinicist whatever. Finally,\r\nOswald’s dementia declares itself with a suddenness and completeness\r\nfound in acute mania only; but the description given of Oswald in\r\nthe last scene--his immobility, his ‘dull and toneless’ voice, and\r\nhis idiotic murmuring of the words ‘the sun, the sun,’ repeated half\r\na dozen times--does not in the remotest degree correspond with the\r\npicture of acute mania.\r\n\r\nThe poet has naturally no need to understand anything of pathology.\r\nBut when he pretends to describe real life, he ought to be honest.\r\nHe should not get out of his depth in scientific observation and\r\nprecision simply because these are demanded or preferred by the age.\r\nThe more ignorant the poet is in pathology, the greater is the test\r\nof his veracity given by his clinical pictures. As he cannot, in his\r\nlay capacity, draw on his imagination for them by combining clinical\r\nexperiences and reminiscences of books, it is necessary that he\r\nshall have seen with his own eyes each case represented to depict it\r\naccurately. Shakespeare was likewise no physician; and, besides, what\r\ndid the physicians of his time know? Yet we can to this day still\r\ndiagnose without hesitation the _dementia senilis_ of Lear, Hamlet’s\r\nweakness of will through nervous exhaustion (_neurasthenic ‘aboalie’_),\r\nthe melancholia, accompanied with optical hallucination, of Lady\r\nMacbeth. Why? Because Shakespeare introduced into his creations things\r\nreally seen. Ibsen, on the contrary, has freely invented his invalids,\r\nand that this method could, in the hands of a layman, only lead to\r\nlaughable results, needs no proof. A moving or affecting situation\r\noffers itself to his imagination--that of a man who clearly foresees\r\nhis near and inevitable death, and with violent self-conquest lifts\r\nhimself to the stoic philosophy of renunciation; or that of a young\r\nman who adjures his mother to kill him when the madness he awaits with\r\nhorror shall break out. The situation is very improbable. Perhaps it\r\nhas never occurred. In any event, Ibsen has never witnessed it. But if\r\nit occurred it would possess great poetic beauty, and produce a great\r\neffect on the stage. Consequently Ibsen calmly turns out the novel and\r\nunknown maladies of a Dr. Rank or an Oswald Alving, the progress of\r\nwhich might make these situations possible. Such is the procedure of\r\nthe poet whose realism and accurate observation are so much vaunted by\r\nhis admirers.\r\n\r\nHis clearness of mind, his love of liberty, his modernity! Careful\r\nreaders of Ibsen’s works will not trust their eyes when they see these\r\nwords applied to him. We will at once put immediate and exhaustive\r\ntests to the clearness of his thought. His love of liberty will\r\nbe revealed by analysis as anarchism; and his modernity amounts\r\nessentially to this, that in his pieces railways are constructed\r\n(_The Pillars of Society_), that there is a cackle about bacilli (_An\r\nEnemy of the People_), that the struggles of political parties play a\r\npart in them (_The League of the Young_, _Rosmersholm_)--all put on\r\nsuperficially with a brush, without inner dependence upon the true\r\nactive forces in the poem. This ‘modern,’ this ‘apostle of liberty,’\r\nhas an idea of the press and its functions fit for a clerk in a\r\npolice-station, and he pursues journalists with the hatred, droll in\r\nthese days, of a tracker of demagogues in the third decade of this\r\ncentury. All the journalists whom he sets before us--and they are\r\nnumerous in his pieces, Peter Mortensgaard in _Rosmersholm_, Haustad\r\nand Billing in _An Enemy of the People_, Bahlmann in _The League of the\r\nYoung_--are either drunken ragamuffins or poor knock-kneed starvelings,\r\nconstantly trembling at the prospect of being thrashed or kicked out,\r\nor unprincipled rascals who write for anyone who pays. He has so clear\r\na grasp of the social question that he makes a foreman mix with the\r\nworkmen and threaten a strike because machines are about to be used on\r\nthe wharves (_The Pillars of Society_)! He looks upon the masses with\r\nthe fine contempt of the great feudal landlords. When he mentions them\r\nit is either with biting derision or a most aristocratic and arrogant\r\ndisdain.[338]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of his notions, moreover, belong to no time, but are\r\nemanations from his personal perversity, and can, therefore, be neither\r\nmodern or not modern; the least uncouth of them, however, having\r\ntheir root in a definite period, spring from the circle of ideas of a\r\nGothamist of the first third of the present century. The label ‘modern’\r\nwas arbitrarily attached to Ibsen by George Brandes (_Moderne Geister_,\r\nFrankfurt, 1886), one of the most repulsive literary phenomena of the\r\ncentury. George Brandes, a sponger on the fame or name of others, has\r\nthroughout his life followed the calling of a ‘human orchestra,’ who\r\nwith head, mouth, hands, elbows, knees, and feet, plays ten noisy\r\ninstruments at once, dancing before poets and authors, and, after the\r\nhubbub, passes his hat round among the deafened public. For a quarter\r\nof a century he has assiduously courted the favour of all who for\r\nany reason had a following, and written rhetorical and sophistical\r\nphrases about them, as long as he could find a market. Adorned with a\r\nfew feathers plucked from the stately pinions of Taine’s genius, and\r\nprating of John Stuart Mill, whose treatise _On Liberty_ he has glanced\r\nat, but hardly read, and certainly not understood, he introduced\r\nhimself among the youth of Scandinavia, and, abusing their confidence,\r\nobtained by this means, has made their systematic moral poisoning the\r\ntask of his life. He preached to them the gospel of passion, and,\r\nwith truly diabolical zeal and obstinacy, confused all their notions,\r\ngiving to whatever he extolled that was mean and reprehensible the\r\nmost attractive and honourable names. It has always been thought weak\r\nand cowardly to yield to base impulses condemned by judgment, instead\r\nof combating and stifling them. If Brandes had said to the young,\r\n‘Renounce your judgment! Sacrifice duty to your passions! Be ruled by\r\nyour senses! Let your will and consciousness be as feathers before the\r\nstorm of your appetites!’--the better among his hearers would have\r\nspit at him. But he said to them: ‘To obey one’s senses is to have\r\ncharacter. He who allows himself to be guided by his passions has\r\nindividuality. The man of strong will despises discipline and duty, and\r\nfollows every caprice, every temptation, every movement of his stomach\r\nor his other organs’; and these vulgarities, thus presented, no longer\r\nhad the repulsive character which awakens distrust and serves as a\r\nwarning. Proclaimed under the names of ‘liberty’ and ‘moral autonomy,’\r\ndebauchery and dissoluteness gain easy admission into the best circles,\r\nand depravity, from which all would turn if it appeared as such,\r\nseems to insufficiently informed minds attractive and desirable when\r\ndisguised as ‘modernity.’ It is comprehensible that an educator who\r\nturns the schoolroom into a tavern and a brothel should have success\r\nand a crowd of followers. He certainly runs the risk of being slain by\r\nthe parents, if they come to know what he is teaching their children;\r\nbut the pupils will hardly complain, and will be eager to attend\r\nthe lessons of so agreeable a teacher. By a similar method Brandes\r\nacquitted himself of his educational functions. This is the explanation\r\nof the influence he gained over the youth of his country, such as his\r\nwritings, with their emptiness of thought and unending tattle, would\r\ncertainly never have procured for him.\r\n\r\nBrandes discovered in Ibsen a revolt against the prevailing moral law,\r\ntogether with a glorification of bestial instincts, and accordingly\r\ntrumpeted his praises in spite of his astounding reactionary views, as\r\na ‘modern spirit,’ recommending Ibsen’s works, with a wink of the eye,\r\nto the knowledge-craving youth, whom he served as _maître de plaisir_.\r\nBut this ‘modern,’ this ‘realist,’ with his exact ‘scientific’\r\nobservation, is in reality a mystic and an ego-maniacal anarchist. An\r\nanalysis of his intellectual peculiarities will enable us to discern a\r\nresemblance to those of Richard Wagner, which is not surprising, since\r\na similarity in features is precisely a stigma of degeneracy, and for\r\nthis reason is common to many, or to all, higher degenerates.\r\n\r\nIbsen is the child of a rigorously religious race, and grew up in a\r\nfamily of believers. The impressions of childhood have determined\r\nthe course of his life. His mind has never been able to iron out the\r\ntheological crease it got through nurture. The Bible and Catechism\r\nbecame for him the bounds beyond which he has never passed. His\r\nfree-thinking diatribes against established Christianity (_Brand_,\r\n_Rosmersholm_, etc.), his derision of the shackled pietism of\r\ndivines (Manders in _Ghosts_, Rörlund in _The Pillars of Society_,\r\nthe dean in _Brand_), are an echo of his teacher, the theosophist,\r\nSœren Kierkegaard (1815-55), a zealot certainly for quite another\r\nChristianity than that ordained by the state, and provided with powers\r\nof nomination and fixed salaries, but nevertheless an austere and\r\nexclusive Christianity, demanding the whole being of man. Perhaps even\r\nIbsen looks upon himself as a free-thinker. Wagner did the same. But\r\nwhat does that prove? He is not clear with regard to his own thought.\r\n\r\n‘It is curious,’ writes Herbert Spencer,[339] ‘how commonly men\r\ncontinue to hold, in fact, doctrines which they have rejected in name,\r\nretaining the substance after they have abandoned the form. In theology\r\nan illustration is supplied by Carlyle, who, in his student days,\r\ngiving up, as he thought, the creed of his fathers, rejected its shell\r\nonly, keeping the contents, and was proved by his conceptions of the\r\nworld, and man and conduct, to be still among the sternest of Scotch\r\nCalvinists.’ If Spencer, when he wrote this, had known Ibsen, he would\r\nperhaps have cited him as a second example. As Carlyle was always a\r\nScotch Calvinist, so Ibsen has always remained a Norwegian Protestant\r\nof the school of Kierkegaard--that is to say, a Protestant with the\r\nearnest mysticism of a Jacob Boehme, a Swedenborg, or a Pusey, which\r\neasily passes over into the Catholicism of a St. Theresa or a Ruysbroek.\r\n\r\nThree fundamental ideas of Christianity are ever present in his mind,\r\nand about these as round so many axes revolves the entire activity\r\nof his poetical imagination. These three unalterable central ideas,\r\nconstituting genuine obsessions, reaching up from the unconscious into\r\nhis intellectual life, are original sin, confession and self-sacrifice\r\nor redemption.\r\n\r\nÆsthetic chatterers have spoken of the idea of heredity influencing all\r\nIbsen’s works, an idea which cannot escape even the feeblest attention,\r\nas something appertaining to modern science and Darwinism. As a matter\r\nof fact, it is the ever-recurring original sin of St. Augustine, and\r\nit betrays its theological nature, firstly by the circumstance that\r\nit makes its appearance in conjunction with the two other theological\r\nideas of confession and redemption, and secondly, by the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of hereditary transmission. As we have above seen,\r\nIbsen’s personages always inherit a disease (blindness, consumption\r\nof the spinal marrow, madness), a vice (mendaciousness, levity,\r\nlewdness, obduracy), or some defect (incapacity for enjoyment), but\r\nnever an agreeable or useful quality. Now what is good and wholesome is\r\njust as frequently inherited as what is evil and diseased--even more\r\nfrequently, according to many investigators. Hence if Ibsen had really\r\nwished to exhibit the operation of the law of heredity as understood\r\nby Darwin, he would have offered us at least one example, if only one,\r\nof the inheritance of good qualities. But not a single instance is to\r\nbe met with in all his dramas. What his beings possess of good, comes\r\none knows not whence. They have always inherited nothing but evil.\r\nThe gentle Hedvig in _The Wild Duck_ becomes blind like her father,\r\nWerle. But from whom does she get her dreamy wealth of imagination, her\r\ndevoted loving heart? Her father is a cold egoist, and her mother a\r\nclever, practical, prosaic housewife. Thus she can never have inherited\r\nher fine qualities from either of her parents. From them she receives\r\nonly her eye-disease. With Ibsen heredity is only a visitation, a\r\npunishment for the sins of the fathers; science knows of no such\r\nexclusive heredity; theology alone knows it, and it is simply original\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nIbsen’s second theological _motif_ is confession; in nearly all his\r\npieces such is the goal to which all the action tends; not, perchance,\r\nforced by circumstances upon a dissimulating offender, not the\r\ninevitable revelation of a hidden misdeed, but the voluntary outpouring\r\nof a pent-up soul, the voluptuous, self-tormenting disclosure of an\r\nugly inner wound, the remorseful ‘My guilt, my deepest guilt!’ of the\r\nsinner breaking down under the weight of his burdened conscience,\r\nhumbling himself to an avowal that he may find inward peace; in short,\r\ngenuine confession as required by the Church. In _A Doll’s House_,\r\nHelmer informs his wife (p. 44): ‘Many a man can lift himself up\r\nagain morally if he openly recognises his offence and undergoes its\r\npunishment.... Only just think how a man so conscious of guilt as\r\nthat must go about everywhere lying, and a hypocrite, and an actor;\r\nhow he must wear a mask towards his neighbour, and even his wife and\r\nchildren.’ For him not the guilt, but the dissimulation, is the great\r\nevil, and its true expiation consists in ‘public avowal’--_i.e._,\r\nin confession. In the same piece Mrs. Linden, without any external\r\nnecessity, and simply in obedience to an inner impulse, makes the\r\nfollowing confession (p. 87): ‘I, too, have suffered shipwreck.... I\r\nhad no choice at the time’; while later on she develops the theory of\r\nconfession once more (p. 90): ‘Helmer must know everything; between\r\nthose two there must be the completest possible understanding, and that\r\ncan never come to pass while all these excuses and concealments are\r\ngoing on.’\r\n\r\nIn _The Pillars of Society_ Miss Hessel exacts a confession in these\r\nterms (p. 70):\r\n\r\n Here you are, the first man in the town, living in wealth and pride,\r\n in power and honour--you who have set the brand of crime upon an\r\n innocent man.\r\n\r\n BERNICK. Do you think I do not feel deeply how I have wronged him? Do\r\n you think I am not prepared to make atonement?\r\n\r\n LONA. How? By speaking out?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. Can you ask such a thing?\r\n\r\n LONA. What else can atone for such a wrong?\r\n\r\nAnd Johan also says (p. 75):\r\n\r\n In two months I shall be back again.\r\n\r\n BERNICK. And then you will tell all?\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Then the guilty one must take the guilt upon himself.\r\n\r\nBernick actually makes the confession demanded of him from pure\r\ncontrition, for at the time he makes it all proofs of his crime are\r\ndestroyed, and he has nothing more to fear from other persons. His\r\nconfession is couched in most edifying terms (p. 108):\r\n\r\n I must begin by rejecting the panegyric with which you ... have\r\n overwhelmed me. I do not deserve it; for until to-day I have not been\r\n disinterested in my dealings.... I have no right to this homage; for\r\n ... my intention was to retain the whole myself.... My fellow-citizens\r\n must know me to the core ... that from this evening we begin a new\r\n time. The old, with its tinsel, its hypocrisy, its hollowness, its\r\n lying propriety, and its pitiful cowardice, shall lie behind us like\r\n a museum open for instruction.... My fellow-citizens, I will come out\r\n of the lie; it had almost poisoned every fibre of my being. You shall\r\n know all. Fifteen years ago _I_ was the guilty one, etc.\r\n\r\nIn _Rosmersholm_ there is hardly any other subject treated of than the\r\nconfession of all before all. In the very first visit of Kroll (p. 15)\r\nRebecca urges Rosmer to confess:\r\n\r\n REBECCA (_comes up close to Rosmer, and says rapidly and in a low\r\n voice, so that the Rector does not hear her_). Do it now!\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_also in a low voice_). Not this evening.\r\n\r\n REBECCA (_as before_). Yes, this very evening.\r\n\r\nAs he does not at once obey she will speak for him (p. 19):\r\n\r\n REBECCA. You must let me tell you frankly.\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_quickly_). No, no; be quiet. Not just now!\r\n\r\nRosmer soon does it himself (p. 28):\r\n\r\n KROLL. We two are in practical agreement--at any rate, on the great\r\n essential questions.\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_in a low voice_). No; not now.\r\n\r\n KROLL (_tries to jump up_). What is this?\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_holding him_). No; you must sit still. I entreat you, Kroll.\r\n\r\n KROLL. What can this mean? I don’t understand you. Speak plainly.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. A new summer has blossomed in my soul. I see with eyes grown\r\n young again; and so now I stand----\r\n\r\n KROLL. Where? where, Rosmer?\r\n\r\n ROSMER. Where your children stand.\r\n\r\n KROLL. You? you? Impossible! Where do you say you stand?\r\n\r\n ROSMER. On the same side as Laurits and Hilda.\r\n\r\n KROLL (_bows his head_). An apostate! Johannes Rosmer an apostate!...\r\n Is this becoming language for a priest?\r\n\r\n ROSMER. I am no longer a priest.\r\n\r\n KROLL. Well, but--the faith of your childhood----?\r\n\r\n ROSMER. Is mine no longer.... I have given it up. I _had_ to give it\r\n up.... Peace, and joy, and mutual forbearance must once more enter our\r\n souls. That is why I am stepping forward and openly avowing myself for\r\n what I am....\r\n\r\n REBECCA. There now; he’s on his way to his great sacrifice.\r\n\r\n(We may here note the purely theological designation given to Rosmer’s\r\nact.)\r\n\r\n ROSMER. I feel so relieved now it is over. You see, I am quite calm\r\n Rebecca....\r\n\r\nLike Rosmer, Rebecca also confesses to Rector Kroll (p. 86):\r\n\r\n REBECCA. Yes, Herr Rector, Rosmer and I--we say _thou_ to each other.\r\n The relation between us has led to that.... Come, let us sit down,\r\n dear--all three of us--and then I will tell the whole story.\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_seats himself mechanically_). What has come over you,\r\n Rebecca? This unnatural calmness--what is it?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. I have only to tell you something.... Now it must out. It was\r\n not you, Rosmer. You are innocent; it was _I_ who lured Beata out into\r\n the paths of delusion ... that led to the mill-race. Now you know it,\r\n both of you....\r\n\r\n ROSMER (_after a pause_). Have you confessed all now, Rebecca?\r\n\r\nNo, not yet all. But she hastens to complete to Rosmer the confession\r\nbegun to Kroll (p. 98):\r\n\r\n ROSMER. Have you more confessions to make?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. The greatest of all is to come.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. The greatest?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. What you have never suspected. What gives light and shade to\r\n all the rest, etc.\r\n\r\nIn _The Lady from the Sea_, Ellida (p. 19) confesses to Arnholm the\r\nstory of her insensate betrothal with the foreign sailor. Arnholm so\r\nlittle comprehends the need of this confession, made without rhyme or\r\nreason, that he asks with astonishment: ‘What is your object, then, in\r\ntelling me that you were bound?’ ‘Because I must have someone in whom\r\nto confide,’ is Ellida’s sole--and, moreover, sufficient--answer.\r\n\r\nIn _Hedda Gabler_ the inevitable confessions take place before the\r\ncommencement of the piece. ‘Yes, Hedda,’ Lövborg says (p. 123). ‘And\r\nwhen I used to confess to you! Told you about myself--things that\r\nnobody else knew in those days. Sat there and admitted that I had been\r\nout on the loose for whole days and nights.... Ah, Hedda, what power\r\nwas it in you that forced me to acknowledge things like that?... Had\r\nnot you an idea that you could wash me clean if only I came to you in\r\nconfession?’ He confesses in order to receive absolution.\r\n\r\nIn _The Wild Duck_ confession is equally prominent, but it is\r\ndeliciously ridiculed. The scene in which Gina confesses to her husband\r\nher early liaison with Werle is one of the most exquisite things in\r\ncontemporary drama (Act IV.).\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Is it true--can it be true that--that there was an--an\r\n understanding between you and Mr. Werle, while you were in service\r\n there?\r\n\r\n GINA. That’s not true. Not at that time. Mr. Werle did come after me,\r\n I own it; and his wife thought there was something in it ... so that I\r\n left her service.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. But afterwards, then!\r\n\r\n GINA. Well, then I went home. And mother--well, she wasn’t the woman\r\n you took her for, Ekdal; she kept on worrying and worrying at me about\r\n one thing and another. For Mr. Werle was a widower by that time.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Well, and then?\r\n\r\n GINA. I suppose you must know it. He didn’t give it up until he’d had\r\n his way.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR (_striking his hands together_). And this is the mother of my\r\n child! How could you hide this from me?\r\n\r\n GINA. It was wrong of me; I ought certainly to have told you long ago.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. You should have told me at the very first; then I should have\r\n known what you were.\r\n\r\n GINA. But would you have married me all the same?\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. How can you suppose so?\r\n\r\n GINA. That’s just why I didn’t dare to tell you anything then. I’d\r\n come to care for you so much, you know; and I couldn’t go and make\r\n myself utterly miserable....\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Haven’t you every day, every hour, repented of the spider’s\r\n web of deceit you had spun around me? Answer me that! How could you\r\n help writhing with penitence and remorse?\r\n\r\n GINA. My dear Ekdal, I’ve plenty to do looking after the house, and\r\n all the daily business----\r\n\r\nFurther on the idea of self-deliverance and purification through\r\nconfession is pitilessly travestied.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Haven’t you done it yet?\r\n\r\n HJALMAR (_aloud_). It _is_ done.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. It _is_?... After so great a crisis--a crisis that’s to be\r\n the starting-point of an entirely new life--of a communion founded on\r\n truth, and free from falsehood of any kind.... Surely you feel a new\r\n consecration after the great crisis.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Yes, of course I do--that is, in a sort of way.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. For I’m sure there’s nothing in the world to compare with the\r\n joy of forgiving one who has erred, and raising her up to one’s self\r\n in love, etc.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the guillotine, Avinain, the French assassin, condensed\r\nthe experience of his life in the pithy saying, ‘Never confess.’ But\r\nthis is advice which only those of strong will and healthy minds\r\ncan follow. A lively idea vehemently demands to be transformed into\r\nmovement. The movement exacting the least effort is that of the small\r\nmuscles of the larynx, tongue, and lips, _i.e._, the organs of speech.\r\nAnyone, therefore, having a specially lively idea experiences a strong\r\ndesire to relax those cell-groups of his brain in which this idea\r\nis elaborated by allowing the transmission of their stimulus to the\r\norgans of speech. In a word, he desires to speak out. And if he is\r\nweak, if the inhibitive power of the will is not greater than the motor\r\nimpulse proceeding from the ideational centre, he will burst out into\r\nspeech, be the consequences what they may. That this psychological\r\nlaw has always been known is proved by all literature, from the fable\r\nof King Midas to Dostojewski’s _Raskolnikow_; and the Catholic Church\r\nfurnished one more proof of her profound knowledge of human nature\r\nwhich she transformed the primitive Christian custom of confession\r\nbefore the assembled congregation, which was to be a self-humiliation\r\nand expiation, into auricular confession, which serves the purpose\r\nof a safe and blissful alleviation and relaxation, and constitutes\r\nfor ordinary men a primary psychic need of the first order. It was\r\nthis sort of confession which Ibsen, probably unconsciously, had in\r\nview. (‘Because I must have someone in whom I can confide,’ as Ellida\r\nsays.) Himself a degenerate, Ibsen can picture to himself only the\r\nintellectual life of degenerates, in whom the mechanism of inhibition\r\nis always disordered, and who, therefore, cannot escape from the\r\nimpulse to confess, when anything of an absorbing or exciting character\r\nexists in their consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe third and most important theological obsession of Ibsen is the\r\nsaving act of Christ, the redemption of the guilty by a voluntary\r\nacceptance of their guilt. This devolution of sin upon a lamb of\r\nsacrifice occupies the same position in Ibsen’s drama as in Richard\r\nWagner’s. The _motif_ of the sacrificial lamb and of redemption\r\nis constantly present in his mind, certainly not always clear and\r\ncomprehensible, but, conformably with the confusion of his thought,\r\ndiversely distorted, obscured, and, so to speak, in _contrapuntal_\r\ninversion. Now Ibsen’s personages voluntarily and joyfully bear the\r\ncross, in keeping with the Christ-idea; now it is put upon their\r\nshoulders by force or artifice, which is, as theologians would say,\r\na diabolical mockery of this idea; now the sacrifice for another\r\nis sincere, now mere hypocrisy; the effects Ibsen draws from the\r\nincessantly recurring _motif_ are, agreeably with its form, now moral\r\nand affecting, now comically base and repulsive.\r\n\r\nIn _The Pillars of Society_ there is a talk of some ‘scandal’ which\r\noccurred years before the commencement of the piece. The husband of the\r\nactress Dorf, on returning home one evening, found her with a stranger,\r\nwho, on his entrance, sprang out of the window. The affair caused\r\ngreat excitement and indignation in the Norwegian Gotham. Immediately\r\nafterwards Johan Tönnesen fled to America. Everyone looked upon him as\r\nthe ‘culprit.’ In reality, however, it was his brother-in-law, Bernick.\r\nJohan had voluntarily incurred the blame of Bernick’s fault. On his\r\nreturn from America the sinner and the sacrificial lamb discuss the\r\ncircumstance (p. 45):\r\n\r\n BERNICK. Johan, now we are alone, you must give me leave to thank you.\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Oh, nonsense!\r\n\r\n BERNICK. My house and home, my domestic happiness, my whole position\r\n as a citizen in society--all these I owe to you.\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Well, I am glad of it....\r\n\r\n BERNICK. Thanks, thanks all the same. Not one in ten thousand would\r\n have done what you then did for me.\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Oh, nonsense!... One of us had to take the blame upon him.\r\n\r\n BERNICK. But to whom did it lie nearer than to the guilty one?\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Stop! _Then_ it lay nearer to the innocent one. I was alone,\r\n free, an orphan.... You, on the other hand, had your old mother in\r\n life; and, besides, you had just become secretly engaged to Betty, and\r\n she was very fond of you. What would have become of her if she had\r\n come to know----?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. True, true, true; but ... but yet, that you should turn\r\n appearances against yourself, and go away----\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Have no scruples, my dear Karsten ... you had to be saved, and\r\n you were my friend.\r\n\r\nHere the idea of the sacrificial lamb is normal and rational. But it is\r\nsoon afterwards introduced into the same piece in a distorted shape.\r\nBernick sends the rotten-keeled _Indian Girl_ to sea, to her certain\r\ndestruction, in spite of his foreman Aune’s opposition. While, however,\r\nplanning this wholesale murder, he also schemes for laying the burden\r\nof his crime on the innocent Aune (p. 65):\r\n\r\n KRAP. ... There is rascality at work, Consul.\r\n\r\n BERNICK. I cannot believe it, Krap. I cannot, and will not believe\r\n such a thing of Aune.\r\n\r\n KRAP. I am sorry for it, but it is the plain truth.... All bogus! The\r\n _Indian Girl_ will never get to New York....\r\n\r\n BERNICK. But this is horrible! What do you think can be his motive?\r\n\r\n KRAP. He probably wants to bring the machines into discredit....\r\n\r\n BERNICK. And for that he would sacrifice all these lives?... But\r\n such a piece of villainy as this! Listen, Krap; this affair must\r\n be examined into again. Not a word of it to anyone.... During the\r\n dinner-hour you must go down there again; I must have perfect\r\n certainty.... We cannot make ourselves accomplices in a crime. I must\r\n keep my conscience unspotted, etc.\r\n\r\nIn _Ghosts_ the idea of the lamb of sacrifice is equally travestied.\r\nThe asylum founded by Mrs. Alving has been burnt. The joiner,\r\nEngstrand, that theatrical villain, succeeds in persuading the idiotic\r\npastor, Manders, that he--Manders--was the cause of the fire. And\r\nas the pastor is made desperate by the possible legal consequences,\r\nEngstrand goes to him and says (p. 184):\r\n\r\n Jacob Engstrand isn’t the man to desert a noble benefactor in the hour\r\n of need, as the saying is [!].\r\n\r\n MANDERS. Yes; but, my good fellow, how----?\r\n\r\n ENGSTRAND. Jacob Engstrand may be likened to a guardian angel--he may,\r\n your reverence.\r\n\r\n MANDERS. No, no; I can’t accept that.\r\n\r\n ENGSTRAND. Oh, you will though, all the same. I know a man that’s\r\n taken others’ sins upon himself before now, I do.\r\n\r\n MANDERS. Jacob (_wrings his hand_). You are a rare character.\r\n\r\nIn _A Doll’s House_ the idea develops itself with great beauty. Nora\r\nconfidently expects that her husband, on hearing of her forgery, will\r\nassume the blame, and she is resolved not to accept his sacrifice (p.\r\n76):\r\n\r\n NORA. I only wanted to tell you that, Christina; you shall be my\r\n witness.... In case there were to be anybody who wanted to take the\r\n ... the whole blame, I mean ... then you will be able to bear witness\r\n that it is not true, Christina. I know very well what I am saying; I\r\n am in full possession of my senses, and I say to you, Nobody else knew\r\n anything about it; I alone have done everything.... But a miracle will\r\n come to pass even yet ... but it is so terrible, Christina! It must\r\n not happen for anything in the world!\r\n\r\nIn the deepest excitement she looks for the expected miracle, the\r\nrenewal of Christ’s act of salvation in the narrow circumstances of a\r\nsmall village--‘I am the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the\r\nworld.’ And, since the miracle does not come to pass, there takes place\r\nthe immense transformation in her nature which forms the real subject\r\nof the piece. Nora explains this to her husband with the greatest\r\nclearness (p. 116):\r\n\r\n ...The thought never once occurred to me that you could allow yourself\r\n to submit to the conditions of such a man. I was so firmly convinced\r\n that you would say to him, ‘Pray make the affair known to all the\r\n world’; and when that had been done ... then you would, as I firmly\r\n believed, stand before the world, take everything upon yourself, and\r\n say, ‘I am the guilty person.’ ... That was the miracle that I hoped\r\n and feared. And it was to hinder that that I wanted to put an end to\r\n my life.\r\n\r\nIn _The Wild Duck_ the idea of the sacrificial lamb recurs no less\r\nthan three times, and is the moving force of the whole piece. The\r\ninfringement of the forest laws, of which the elder Ekdal was\r\nconvicted, was not committed by him, but by Werle:\r\n\r\n WERLE. ... I was quite in the dark as to what Lieutenant Ekdal was\r\n doing.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Lieutenant Ekdal seems to have been in the dark as to what he\r\n was doing.\r\n\r\n WERLE. That may be. But the fact remains that he was found guilty, and\r\n I acquitted.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Yes, of course I know that nothing was proved against you.\r\n\r\n WERLE. Acquittal is acquittal. Why do you rake up old troubles?...\r\n I’ve done all I could without positively exposing myself, and giving\r\n rise to all sorts of suspicion and gossip.... I’ve given Ekdal copying\r\n to do from the office, and I pay him far, far more for it than his\r\n work is worth.\r\n\r\nWerle thus shuffles his fault on Ekdal, and the latter breaks down\r\nunder the weight of the cross. Afterwards, when Hjalmar learns that\r\nlittle Hedwig is not his child, and disowns her, the idiot Gregers\r\nWerle goes to the despairing maiden, and says:\r\n\r\n But suppose you were to sacrifice the wild duck, of your own free\r\n will, for his sake?\r\n\r\n HEDWIG (_rising_). The wild duck!\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Suppose you were to sacrifice, for his sake, the dearest\r\n treasure you have in the world?\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. Do you think that would do any good?\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Try it, Hedwig.\r\n\r\n HEDWIG (_softly, with flashing eyes_). Yes, I will try it.\r\n\r\nHere, then, Hedwig is not to offer herself in sacrifice, but a pet\r\nanimal, thus abasing the idea from Christianity to paganism. Finally,\r\nit crops up a third time. At the last moment Hedwig cannot make up her\r\nmind to kill the duck, and prefers turning the pistol against her own\r\nbreast, thus purchasing with her own life that of the bird. This dismal\r\ndénouement is worrying and foolish, because useless; the poetical\r\neffect would have been fully attained if Hedwig, instead of dying, had\r\nonly slightly wounded herself; for in this way she would have furnished\r\nequally strong proof that she was seriously determined to bear witness\r\nto her love for her father by the sacrifice of her young life, and to\r\nrestore peace between him and her mother. But æsthetic criticism is not\r\nmy function; I willingly yield that to phrase-makers. All that I have\r\nto indicate is the triple recurrence in _The Wild Duck_ of the idea of\r\nthe sacrificial lamb.\r\n\r\nAt its third appearance this idea suffers a significant transformation.\r\nHedwig sacrifices herself, not in expiation of an offence--for she\r\nis ignorant of her mother’s guilt--but to accomplish a work of\r\nlove. Here the mystico-theological element of redemption recedes\r\ninto the background so far as to be almost imperceptible, and there\r\nremains hardly more than the purely human element of the joy felt in\r\nself-sacrifice for others--an impulse not rare among good women, and\r\nwhich is a manifestation of the unsatisfied yearning for maternity\r\n(often unknown to themselves), and at the same time one of the noblest\r\nand holiest forms of altruism. Ibsen shows this impulse in many of\r\nhis female characters, the source of which in the religious mysticism\r\nof the poet would not be at once noticed, if from the numerous\r\nother conjugations of the root-idea of the sacrificial lamb we had\r\nnot already acquired the sure habit of recognising it even in its\r\nobscurations. Hedwig constitutes a transition from the theological to\r\nthe purely human form of voluntary self-sacrifice. The over-strung\r\nchild carries renunciation to the orthodox extreme of yielding up her\r\nlife; Ibsen’s other women, to whose character Hedwig supplies the key,\r\ngo only to the point of lovingly active self-denial. They do not die\r\nfor others, but they live for others. In _A Doll’s House_ Mrs. Linden\r\nhas this hunger for self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n I must work in order to endure life [she says to Krogstad--p. 87]. I\r\n have worked from my youth up, and work has been my one best friend.\r\n But now I am quite alone in the world--so terribly empty and forsaken.\r\n There is no happiness in working for one’s self. Nils, give me\r\n somebody and something to work for....\r\n\r\n KROGSTAD. What! you really could? Tell me, do you know my past?\r\n\r\n MRS. LINDEN. Yes.\r\n\r\n KROGSTAD. And do you know my reputation?\r\n\r\n MRS. LINDEN. Did you not hint it just now, when you said that with me\r\n you could have been another man?\r\n\r\n KROGSTAD. I am perfectly certain of it.\r\n\r\n MRS. LINDEN. Could it not yet be so?\r\n\r\n KROGSTAD. Christina, do you say this after full deliberation?...\r\n\r\n MRS. LINDEN. I need somebody to mother, and your children need a\r\n mother.\r\n\r\nHere the idea is not so disguised as to be unrecognisable. Krogstad\r\nis a culprit and an outlaw. If Mrs. Linden offers to live for him,\r\nit is certainly chiefly from the instinct of maternity. But in this\r\nnatural feeling there is also a tinge of the mystic idea of the\r\nsinner’s redemption through disinterested love. In _The Lady from the\r\nSea_, Ellida wishes to return to her birthplace on the sea, Skjoldvik,\r\nbecause she believes there is nothing for her to do in Wangel’s house.\r\nAt the announcement of her resolution her stepdaughter, Hilda, evinces\r\na profound despair. Then for the first time Ellida learns that Hilda\r\nloves her; there is then born in her the thought that she has someone\r\nto live for, and she says dreamily: ‘Oh, if there should be something\r\nfor me to do here!’ In _Rosmersholm_ Rebecca says to Kroll (p. 8):\r\n\r\n So long as Mr. Rosmer thinks I am of any use or comfort to him, why,\r\n so long, I suppose, I shall stay here.\r\n\r\n KROLL (_looks at her with emotion_). Do you know, it’s really fine for\r\n a woman to sacrifice her whole youth to others, as you have done.\r\n\r\n REBECCA. Oh, what else should I have had to live for?\r\n\r\nIn _The Pillars of Society_ there are two of these touching\r\nself-sacrificing souls--Miss Martha Bernick and Miss Hessel. Miss\r\nBernick has reared the illegitimate child Dina, and has consecrated her\r\nown life to her (p. 52):\r\n\r\n MARTHA. I have been a mother to that much-wronged child--have brought\r\n her up as well as I could.\r\n\r\n JOHAN. And sacrificed your whole life in so doing.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. It has not been thrown away.\r\n\r\nShe loves Johan, but as she sees that he is attracted by Dina she\r\nunites the two. She explains herself in regard to the incident in an\r\nexceedingly affecting scene with Johan’s half-sister (p. 95):\r\n\r\n LONA. Now we are alone, Martha. You have lost her, and I him.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. You him?\r\n\r\n LONA. Oh, I had half lost him already over there. The boy longed to\r\n stand on his own feet, so I made him think _I_ was longing for home.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. That was it? Now I understand why you came. But he will want\r\n you back again, Lona.\r\n\r\n LONA. An old stepsister--what can he want with her now? Men snap many\r\n bonds to arrive at happiness.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. It is so, sometimes.\r\n\r\n LONA. But now we two must hold together, Martha.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. Can I be anything to you?\r\n\r\n LONA. Who more? We two foster-mothers--have we not both lost our\r\n children? Now we are alone.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. Yes, alone. And therefore I will tell you--I have loved him\r\n more than all the world.\r\n\r\n LONA. Martha! (_seizes her arm_). Is this the truth?\r\n\r\n MARTHA. My whole life lies in the words. I have loved him, and waited\r\n for him. From summer to summer I have looked for his coming. And then\r\n he came, but he did not see me.\r\n\r\n LONA. Loved him! and it was you that gave his happiness into his hands.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. Should I not have given him his happiness, since I loved him?\r\n Yes, I have loved him. My whole life has been for him.... He did not\r\n see me.\r\n\r\n LONA. It was Dina that overshadowed you, Martha.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. It is well that she did! When he went away we were of the\r\n same age. When I saw him again--oh, that horrible moment!--it seemed\r\n to me that I was ten years older than he. He had lived in the bright,\r\n quivering sunshine, and drunk in youth and health at every breath; and\r\n here sat I, the while, spinning and spinning----\r\n\r\n LONA. The thread of his happiness, Martha.\r\n\r\n MARTHA. Yes, it was gold I spun. No bitterness! Is it not true, Lona,\r\n we have been two good sisters to him?\r\n\r\nIn _Hedda Gabler_ it is Miss Tesman, aunt of the imbecile Tesman, who\r\nplays the pathetic part of the sacrificial mother. She has brought\r\nhim up, and when he marries gives him the largest part of her modest\r\nincome. ‘Oh, aunt,’ bleats the poor idiot (p. 18), ‘you will never be\r\ntired of sacrificing yourself for me!’ ‘Do you think,’ replies the good\r\ncreature, ‘I have any other joy in this world than to smooth the way\r\nfor you, my dear boy--you who have never had a father or a mother to\r\nlook after you?’ And when subsequently the paralytic sister of Miss\r\nTesman is dead, Hedda and she hold this conversation (p. 196):\r\n\r\n HEDDA. It will be lonesome for you now, Miss Tesman.\r\n\r\n MISS TESMAN. The first few days, yes. But that won’t last very long.\r\n Dear Rina’s little room will not always be empty, that I know.\r\n\r\n HEDDA. Indeed! Who is going to move into it, eh?\r\n\r\n MISS TESMAN. Oh, there is always some poor invalid or other who needs\r\n to be looked after and tended, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n HEDDA. Will you really take such a burden upon you again?\r\n\r\n MISS TESMAN. Burden! God forgive you, child! that has never been a\r\n burden to me.\r\n\r\n HEDDA. But now, if a stranger should come, then surely----\r\n\r\n MISS TESMAN. Oh, one soon becomes friends with sick people. And I must\r\n positively have someone to live for, too.\r\n\r\nThe three Christo-dogmatic obsessions of original sin, confession,\r\nand self-sacrifice, filling Ibsen’s dramas, as we have seen, from the\r\nfirst line to the last, are not the only tokens of his mysticism. This\r\nbetrays itself by a whole series of other peculiarities, which shall be\r\nbriefly indicated.\r\n\r\nAt the head of these stands the astoundingly chaotic nature of his\r\nthought. One cannot believe one’s eyes while reading how his fulsome\r\nflatterers have had the audacity to extol him for the ‘clearness’ and\r\n‘precision’ of his thought. Do these individuals, then, imagine that\r\nno one capable of forming a judgment will ever read a line of Ibsen? A\r\nclearly-defined thought is an extraordinary rarity in this Norwegian\r\ndramatist. Everything floats and undulates, nebulous and amorphous,\r\nsuch as we are accustomed to see in weak-brained degenerates. And\r\nif he once succeeds, with toil and stress, in grasping anything and\r\nexpressing it in a moderately intelligible manner, he unfailingly\r\nhastens, a few pages later, or in a subsequent piece, to say the exact\r\nopposite. A talk is made of Ibsen’s ‘ideas on morality’ and of his\r\n‘philosophy.’ He has not formulated a single proposition on morality, a\r\nsingle conception of the world and life, that he has not himself either\r\nrefuted or fittingly ridiculed.\r\n\r\nHe seems to preach free love, and his eulogy of a licentiousness\r\nunchecked by any self-control, regardless of contracts, laws, and\r\nmorality, has made of him a ‘modern spirit’ in the eyes of Georg\r\nBrandes and similar protectors of those ‘youths who wish to amuse\r\nthemselves a little.’ Mrs. Alving (_Ghosts_, p. 158), calls a ‘crime’\r\nthe act of Pastor Manders in repulsing her, after she has quitted her\r\nhusband and thrown herself on the pastor’s neck. This highly-strung\r\ndame pushes Regina into the arms of Oswald, her son, when in shameless\r\nspeech he informs her that it would give him pleasure to possess the\r\ngirl. And this very same Mrs. Alving speaks in terms of the deepest\r\nindignation of her dead husband as ‘profligate’ (p. 146), and again\r\ndesignates him in the presence of her son as a ‘broken-down man’\r\n(in the original it is ‘et forfaldent Menneske,’ an epithet usually\r\nbestowed on fallen women), and why? Because he had had wanton relations\r\nwith women! Well, but is it in Ibsen’s opinion permissible, or not\r\npermissible, to gratify carnal lust as often as it is awakened? If\r\nit is permissible, how does Mrs. Alving come to speak with scorn of\r\nher husband? If it is not permissible, how dared she offer herself\r\nto Pastor Manders, and be the procuress between Regina and her own\r\nhalf-brother? Or does the moral law hold good for man only, and not\r\nfor woman? An English proverb says, ‘What’s sauce for the goose is\r\nsauce for the gander.’ Ibsen evidently does not share the opinion of\r\npopular lore. A woman who runs away from her legal husband and pursues\r\na lover (Mrs. Elvsted and Ejlert Lövborg, in _Hedda Gabler_), or who\r\noffers to form an illicit connection with a man, although nothing\r\nprevents their marrying without further ado like other rational\r\nratepayers (Mrs. Linden and Krogstad in _A Doll’s House_)--such women\r\nhave Ibsen’s entire approbation and sympathy. But if a man seduces a\r\nmaiden and liberally provides for her subsequent maintenance (Werle and\r\nGina in _The Wild Duck_), or, again, if he has illicit relations with\r\na married woman (Consul Bernick and the actress Dorf in _The Pillars\r\nof Society_), then it is so heinous a crime that the culprit remains\r\nbranded his whole life, and is nailed by the poet to the pillory with\r\nthe cruelty of a mediæval executioner.\r\n\r\nThe same contradiction finds its expression in another and more general\r\nform. At one time Ibsen contends with ferocious, impetuosity that\r\neveryone is ‘a law unto himself’ alone, _i.e._, that he should obey\r\nevery one of his caprices, nay, even of his diseased impulsions; that,\r\nas his commentators idiotically put it, he should (_sich auslebe_)\r\n‘live out his life.’ In _The Pillars of Society_ Miss Bernick says to\r\nDina (p. 94):\r\n\r\n Promise me to make him [her betrothed] happy.\r\n\r\n DINA. I will not promise anything. I hate this promising; things must\r\n come as they can [_i.e._, as the circumstances of the moment may\r\n suggest to the wayward brain].\r\n\r\n MARTHA. Yes, yes; so they must. You need only remain as you are, true\r\n and faithful to yourself.\r\n\r\n DINA. That I will, Aunt Martha.\r\n\r\nIn _Rosmersholm_, Rosmer says admiringly of the scoundrel Brendel (p.\r\n28): ‘At least he has had the courage to live his life his own way. I\r\ndon’t think that’s such a small matter after all.’ In the same piece\r\nRebecca complains (p. 97): ‘Rosmersholm has broken me.... Broken me\r\nutterly and hopelessly. I had a fresh, undaunted will when I came here.\r\nNow I have bent my neck under a strange law.’ And further on (p. 102):\r\n‘It is the Rosmer view of life ... that has infected my will.... and\r\nmade it sick, enslaved it to laws that had no power over me before.’\r\nEjlert Lövborg laments in like fashion in _Hedda Gabler_. ‘But it is\r\n_this_--that I don’t want to live that kind of life either. Not now,\r\nover again. It is the courage of life and the defiance of life that\r\nshe’ (Thea Elvested, with her sweet, loving constraint) ‘has snapped in\r\nme.’ Quite in opposition to these views, Ibsen, in his _Ghosts_, makes\r\nRegina proclaim her ‘right to live out her life’ in these words (p.\r\n189): ‘Oh! I really can’t stop out here in the country and wear myself\r\nout nursing sick people ... a poor girl must make the best of her young\r\ndays.... I, too, want to enjoy my life, Mrs. Alving.’ Mrs. Alving\r\nreplies: ‘Alas! yes.’ This ‘alas’ is bewildering. Alas? Why ‘alas’?\r\nDoes she not obey her ‘law’ if she satisfies her ‘joy in living,’ and,\r\nas she forthwith explains, enters the house of ill-fame for sailors\r\nset up by the joiner Engstrand? How can Mrs. Alving utter this ‘alas,’\r\nwhen she also was ‘obeying her law’ in offering herself as the mistress\r\nof Pastor Manders, and since she wished to aid her son in ‘obeying his\r\nlaw,’ when he had set his eyes on Regina? It is because Ibsen, in his\r\nlucid moments, feels that there may be something of danger in ‘obeying\r\none’s law,’ and this ‘alas’ of Mrs. Alving escapes him as a confession.\r\nIn _The Wild Duck_ he ridicules his own dogma in the most liberal\r\nstyle. In that piece there is one Molvig, a candidate for a University\r\ndegree, who also ‘obeys his law.’ This law prescribes that he shall\r\nlearn nothing, evade his examinations, and pass his nights in taverns.\r\nThe scoffer, Relling, asserts (p. 317) that it ‘comes over him like a\r\nsort of possession; and then I have to go out on the loose with him.\r\nMolvig is a demoniac, you see, ... and demoniac natures are not made to\r\nwalk straight through the world; they must meander now and then. And in\r\norder that there shall be no doubt as to what Relling means by this,\r\nhe subsequently explains (p. 361): ‘“What the devil do you mean by\r\ndemoniac?” “It’s only a piece of hocus-pocus I’ve invented to keep up\r\na spark of life in him. But for that the poor harmless creature would\r\nhave succumbed to self-contempt and despair many a long year ago.”’\r\n\r\nThat is true. Molvig is a pitiable weakling, unable to conquer his\r\nindolence and passion for drink; abandoned to his own devices, he would\r\nrecognise himself for the miserable creature he is, and despise himself\r\nas profoundly as he deserves; but Relling arrives on the scene, and\r\ngives his lack of character the title ‘demoniac,’ and now ‘the child\r\nhas a fine name,’ which Molvig can make a parade of to himself and\r\nothers. Ibsen does exactly the same thing as his Relling. The weakness\r\nof will, incapable of resisting base and pitiable instincts, he praises\r\nas the ‘will to live out one’s life,’ as the ‘freedom of a spirit who\r\nobeys his own law only,’ and recommends it as the sole rule of life.\r\nBut, unlike Relling, he is for the most part ignorant of the fact that\r\nhe is practising a deception (which I by no means regard in Relling’s\r\nlight as pious and charitable), and believes in his own humbug. That\r\nis, for the most part; not always. Here and there, as in _The Wild\r\nDuck_, he recognises his error and scourges it severely; and his inmost\r\nfeeling is so little influenced by his self-deceptive phrase, fit for\r\na weak-willed degenerate, that he involuntarily and unconsciously\r\nbetrays, in all his productions, his deep abhorrence of men who ‘obey\r\ntheir own law in order to live out their life.’ He punishes Chamberlain\r\nAlving in his son, and makes him cursed by his widow because he has\r\n‘lived out his life.’ He imputes it as a crime to Consul Bernick and\r\nthe merchant Werle that they have ‘lived out their life,’ the former\r\nin sacrificing his brother-in-law Johan to protect himself, and for\r\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Dorf, the actress; and the latter for allowing\r\nEkdal to bear the blame of his fault, and for seducing Gina. He\r\nsurrounds with an aureole the glorified heads of Rosmer and Rebecca,\r\nbecause they did not ‘live out their life,’ but, on the contrary, ‘died\r\ntheir death,’ if I may put it so; because they obeyed, not ‘their own\r\nlaw,’ but that of others, the universal moral law that annihilated\r\nthem. Whenever one of his characters acts in accordance with Ibsen’s\r\ndoctrine, and does what is agreeable to himself regardless of morals\r\nand law, he experiences such contrition and self-torment that he is\r\nunable to find calm and joy until he has disburdened his conscience by\r\nconfession and expiation.\r\n\r\n‘This living out one’s life’ makes its appearance in Ibsen in the form\r\nalso of a rigid individualism. The ‘self’ is the only real thing;\r\nthe ‘I’ must be cherished and developed, as, indeed, Barrès preaches\r\nindependently of Ibsen. The first duty of every human being is to be\r\njust to his ‘I,’ to satisfy its demands, to sacrifice to it every\r\nconsideration for others. When Nora wishes to abandon her husband, he\r\ncries (p. 112):\r\n\r\n Only think what people will say about it!\r\n\r\n NORA. I cannot take that into consideration. I only know that to go is\r\n necessary for me.\r\n\r\n HELMER. Oh, it drives one wild! Is this the way you can evade your\r\n holiest duties?\r\n\r\n NORA. What do you consider my holiest duties?\r\n\r\n HELMER. ... Are they not your duties to your husband and your children?\r\n\r\n NORA. I have other duties equally sacred.\r\n\r\n HELMER. ... What duties do you mean?\r\n\r\n NORA. Duties towards myself.\r\n\r\n HELMER. Before all else you are a wife and a mother.\r\n\r\n NORA. I no longer think so. I think that before all else I am a human\r\n being just as you are, or, at least, I will try to become one.\r\n\r\nIn _Ghosts_ Oswald says to his mother with triumphant brutality (p.\r\n192): ‘I can’t be much taken up with other people. I have enough to do\r\nthinking about myself.’ How in the same piece Regina emphasizes her\r\n‘I’ and its rights, we have already seen. In _An Enemy of the People_,\r\nStockmann proclaims the right of the ‘I’ in face of the majority, and\r\neven the race, in these words (p. 283): ‘It is a hideous lie: the\r\ndoctrine that the multitude, the vulgar herd, the masses, are the pith\r\nof the people--that, indeed, they are the people--that the common man,\r\nthat this ignorant, undeveloped member of society, has the same right\r\nto condemn or to sanction, to govern and to rule, as the few people of\r\nintellectual power.’ And (p. 312): ‘I only want to drive into the heads\r\nof these curs that the Liberals are the worst foes of free men ...\r\nthat the considerations of expediency turn morality and righteousness\r\nupside down until life is simply hideous.... Now I am one of the\r\nstrongest men upon earth.... You see the fact is that the strongest\r\nman upon earth is he who stands most alone.’ But this very Stockmann,\r\nwho will hear nothing of ‘the multitude, the vulgar herd, the masses,’\r\nas he reiterates with insufferable tautology, who feels, his ‘I’\r\npowerful only in a majestic solitude, calls his fellow-citizens ‘old\r\nwomen who think only of their families,[340] and not of the general\r\ngood.’ And in the very same piece (_A Doll’s House_), in which Ibsen\r\nevidently bestows loud applause on Nora for declaring that ‘her only\r\nduties were to herself,’ and that she ‘could have no consideration for\r\nanyone else,’ he stigmatizes her husband as a pitiable, low-spirited\r\nweakling, because on his wife’s confession of forgery he first of all\r\nthinks of his own reputation only, and hence of his ‘duty to himself,’\r\nhis only consideration being for himself, and not for his wife. Here\r\nthere recurs the same phenomenon as in Ibsen’s notions concerning\r\nsexual morality. Unchastity in a man is a crime, but in a woman is\r\npermissible. In the same way the rude emphasizing of the ‘I’ is a\r\nmerit only in the woman. The man has no right to be an egoist. How,\r\nfor example, Ibsen rails at egoism through Bernick (in _The Pillars\r\nof Society_), whom he makes say naïvely, in reference to his sister\r\nMartha, that she ‘is quite insignificant’ (p. 49), and that he does not\r\nwish to have her otherwise!\r\n\r\n You know, in a large house like ours, it is always well to have some\r\n steady-going person like her, whom one can put to anything that may\r\n turn up.\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Yes, but she herself?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. She herself? Why, of course she has enough to interest\r\n herself in--Betty and Olaf, and me, you know. People should not think\r\n of themselves first, and women least of all.\r\n\r\nAnd how severely Ibsen condemns the egoism of Mrs. Elvsted’s husband\r\n(_Hedda Gabler_), when he puts these bitter words into her mouth (p.\r\n52): ‘He is not really fond of anybody but himself. Perhaps of the\r\nchildren a little!’\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable thing about this philosopher of individualism\r\nis that he not only expressly condemns egoism in the man as a low\r\nvice, but unconsciously also admires disinterestedness in the woman\r\nas an angelic perfection. In _A Doll’s House_ (p. 113) he brags that\r\n‘my most sacred duties are towards myself.’ And yet the only touching\r\nand charming characters in his pieces with whom this inflexible\r\nindividualist is successful are the saintly women who live and die for\r\nothers only--these Hedwigs, Miss Bernicks, Miss Hessels, Aunt Tesmans,\r\netc., who never think of their ‘I,’ but make the sacrifice of all\r\ntheir impulses and wishes to the welfare of others their sole task on\r\nearth. This contradiction, violent to the point of absurdity, is very\r\nwell explained by the nature of Ibsen’s mind. His mystico-religious\r\nobsession of voluntary self-sacrifice for others is necessarily\r\nstronger than his pseudo-philosophic lucubration on individualism.\r\n\r\nAmong the ‘moral ideas’ of Ibsen are counted his professed thirst for\r\ntruth. At least enough has been said and written on this subject. ‘Only\r\njust think,’ Helmer says to Nora (_A Doll’s House_, pp. 44, 45), ‘how a\r\nman so conscious of guilt as that must go about everywhere lying, and a\r\nhypocrite, and an actor; how he must wear a mask towards his neighbour,\r\nand even his wife and children, his own children. That’s the worst,\r\nNora.... Because such a misty atmosphere of lying brings contagion\r\ninto the whole family.’ ‘Is there no voice in your mother’s heart\r\nthat forbids you to destroy your son’s ideals?’ asks Pastor Manders in\r\n_Ghosts_ (p. 155), when Mrs. Alving has revealed to her son her defunct\r\nhusband’s ‘immorality.’ To which Mrs. Alving magniloquently replies,\r\n‘But what about the truth?’ In _The Pillars of Society_, Lona Hessel\r\nthus preaches to Consul Bernick (p. 57):\r\n\r\n Is it for the sake of the community, then, that for these fifteen\r\n years you have stood upon a lie?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. A lie?... You call that----\r\n\r\n LONA. I call it the lie--the threefold lie. First the lie towards me;\r\n then the lie towards Betty; then the lie towards Johan.... Is there\r\n not something within you that asks you to get clear of the lie?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. You would have me voluntarily sacrifice my domestic\r\n happiness, and my position in society?\r\n\r\n LONA. What right have you to stand where you are standing?\r\n\r\nAnd subsequently (p. 70):\r\n\r\n LONA. A lie, then, has made you the man you now are?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. Whom did it hurt, then?...\r\n\r\n LONA. You ask whom it hurt? Look into yourself, and see if it has not\r\n hurt you.\r\n\r\nBernick then examines himself, and shortly before his confession there\r\ntakes place a highly edifying dialogue between him and the severe\r\nguardian of his conscience (p. 98):\r\n\r\n BERNICK. Yes, yes, yes; it all comes of the lie....\r\n\r\n LONA. Then, why do you not break with all this lying?... What\r\n satisfaction does this show and deception give you?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. ... It is my son I am working for.... There will come a time\r\n when truth shall spread through the life of our society, and upon it\r\n he shall found a happier life than his father’s.\r\n\r\n LONA. With a lie for its groundwork? Reflect what it is you are giving\r\n your son for an inheritance.\r\n\r\nIn _An Enemy of the People_, words of truth are ever coming from the\r\nmouths of the Stockmann family: ‘There’s so much falseness both at\r\nhome and at school,’ declaims their daughter, Petra. ‘At home you\r\nmustn’t speak, and at school you have to stand there and lie to the\r\nchildren.... We have to teach many and many a thing we don’t believe\r\nourselves.... If only I could afford it I’d start a school myself, and\r\nthings should be very different there.’ The courageous maiden quarrels\r\nwith an editor who wished to marry her about his want of veracity\r\n(p. 255): ‘What I am angry with you for is that you have not acted\r\nhonestly towards my father. You told him it was only the truth and\r\nthe good of the community you cared about.... You are not the man you\r\npretend to be. And I shall never forgive you--never!’ ‘The whole of\r\nour developing social life,’ cries the father Stockmann in his turn\r\n(p. 242), ‘is rooted in a lie.’ And later on (p. 287) ‘Yes, I love my\r\nnative town so well I would rather ruin it than see it flourishing\r\nupon a lie.... All men who live upon lies must be exterminated like\r\nvermin. You’ll poison the whole country in time; you’ll bring it to\r\nsuch a pass that the whole country will deserve to perish.’ Now, all\r\nthis would certainly be very fine, if we did not know that this fervent\r\nworship of truth is only one of the forms under which there appears in\r\nIbsen’s consciousness the mystico-religious obsession of the sacrament\r\nof confession, and also, if he were not careful, conformably with\r\nhis habit, to destroy any too hasty belief in the sincerity of his\r\nphraseology by himself ridiculing it. In Gregers Werle he has created\r\nthe best caricature of his men of truth. Gregers speaks in exactly\r\nthe same terms as Lona Hessel, Petra Stockmann, and her father, but\r\nin his mouth the words are intended to excite laughter: ‘And look at\r\nthis confiding nature, this great child,’ he says of his friend Hjalmar\r\n(p. 41). ‘See him enveloped in a net of perfidy, living under the\r\nsame roof as a woman of that kind, not suspecting that his home, as\r\nhe calls it, rests upon a lie.... At length I see an object in life.’\r\nThis object consists in operating on Hjalmar’s moral cataract. And he\r\ndoes it, too. ‘You are sunk in a poisoned quagmire, Hjalmar,’ Gregers\r\nsays to him (p. 101). ‘You have an insidious disease within you, and\r\nyou’ve sunk down to die in the dark.... Don’t be afraid; I will try to\r\nhelp you up again. I, too, have a mission in life now.’ And shortly\r\nafterwards he says to the father: ‘But Hjalmar I can rescue from all\r\nthe falsehood and deception that are bringing him to ruin.’ The scoffer\r\nRelling treats no worse than he deserves the idiot who, in fulfilling\r\nhis ‘mission in life’ disturbs the peace between Hjalmar and his wife,\r\ndestroys their comfortable home, and drives Hedwig to her death.\r\n\r\n Yours is a complicated case ... that troublesome integrity-fever [he\r\n says to him--p. 360]....\r\n\r\n I’m fostering the life-illusion [literally ‘the life-lie’] in him.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Life-illusion? Is that what you said?\r\n\r\n RELLING. Yes, I said illusion. For illusion, you know, is the\r\n stimulating principle.... Rob the average man of his life-illusion,\r\n and you rob him of his happiness at the same time.\r\n\r\nNow, what is Ibsen’s real opinion? Is a man to strive for truth, or\r\nto swelter in deceit? Is Ibsen with Stockmann or with Relling? Ibsen\r\nowes us an answer to these questions, or, rather, he replies to them\r\naffirmatively and negatively with equal ardour and equal poetic power.\r\n\r\nAnother ‘moral idea’ of Ibsen, about which his choristers chatter\r\nmost loudly, is that of ‘true marriage.’ It is certainly not easy to\r\ndiscover what his mystic brain conceives by these mysterious words,\r\nbut it is nevertheless possible to guess it from the hundred obscure\r\nnotions in his plays. He does not seem to approve of the idea that\r\nthe woman should regard marriage as merely a means of maintenance. In\r\nnearly all his pieces he comes to this conclusion with the monotony\r\npeculiar to him. In _Ghosts_, Mrs. Alving ascribes her whole life’s\r\nunhappiness to the fact that she married the chamberlain for his\r\nmoney--that she sold herself. ‘The sums which I have spent upon the\r\norphanage year by year make up the amount--I have reckoned it up\r\nprecisely--the amount which made Lieutenant Alving a good match in his\r\nday.... It was the purchase-money. I do not choose that money should\r\npass into Oswald’s hands’ (p. 149). In _The Lady from the Sea_, Ellida\r\nsings the same song (p. 139): ‘It could bring nothing but unhappiness,\r\nafter the way in which we came together.... Yes, we are (doing so), or,\r\nat least, we suppress the truth. For the truth ... is, that you came\r\nout there and bought me.... I was not a bit better than you. I accepted\r\nthe bargain--sold myself to you. I was so helpless and bewildered, and\r\nso absolutely alone. Oh, it was so natural I should accept the bargain\r\nwhen you came and proposed to provide for me all my life.’ In almost\r\nthe same words Hedda says (_Hedda Gabler_, p. 86): ‘And then he would\r\ngo and make such a tremendous fuss about being allowed to provide for\r\nme. I did not know why I should not accept it.’ She did not know why;\r\nbut her inner feverishness and restlessness, her final suicide, are the\r\nconsequence of her having allowed herself to be ‘provided for.’ The\r\nregard paid to the ‘being provided for’ became also the lifelong misery\r\nof another woman in the same piece--Mrs. Elvsted. She went originally\r\nas ‘governess in the house of her future husband.’ She subsequently\r\nundertook the management of the household. Then she allowed herself\r\nto be married, although ‘everything around him is distasteful to me,’\r\nand ‘we do not possess a thought in common.’ Ibsen condemns the man\r\nwho marries for money not less than the woman who allows herself to be\r\n‘provided for.’ The cause of Bernick’s moral downfall (_The Pillars of\r\nSociety_, p. 56), is chiefly that he did not marry Lona Hessel, whom he\r\nloved, but another. ‘It was for no new fancy that I broke with you; it\r\nwas entirely for the sake of the money.’\r\n\r\nHence one should not marry for gain. That is a principle to which every\r\nrational and moral man will subscribe. But why should one marry? The\r\nmost reasonable answer can only be, ‘From inclination.’ But Ibsen will\r\nhave none of this either. The marriage of Nora and Helmer is purely a\r\nlove-match. It leads to a sudden rupture. Wangel (_The Lady from the\r\nSea_) has married Ellida from inclination. She expressly affirms it\r\n(p. 108): ‘You had only seen me and spoken to me a few times. Then\r\nyou wanted me, and so....’ And then she feels herself a stranger to\r\nhim, and wishes to leave him. So Mrs. Alving, Ellida, Wangel, Hedda\r\nGabler, Mrs. Elvsted, marry from self-interest, and atone for it by the\r\nhappiness of their life. Nora marries for love, and becomes profoundly\r\nunhappy. Consul Bernick marries a girl because she is rich, and pays\r\nfor this fault with his moral downfall. Dr. Wangel marries a girl\r\nbecause she pleases him, and as a reward she wishes to quit him and\r\nher home. What conclusion is to be drawn from all this? That marriage\r\nfrom prudence is bad, and marriage from love no better? That marriage\r\nin general is worth nothing, and should be abolished? That would be at\r\nleast an inference and a solution. It is not there that Ibsen arrives.\r\nInclination does not suffice, even if, as in the case of Nora, it is\r\nreciprocal. Something else is still necessary--the man must become the\r\neducator of his wife. He must help her intellectually. He must let her\r\nparticipate in all his concerns, make of her a companion possessing\r\nequal rights, and have unlimited confidence in her. Otherwise she\r\nalways remains a stranger in her house. Otherwise the marriage is no\r\n‘true marriage.’ ‘I have no right to claim my husband wholly and solely\r\nfor myself,’ Ellida confesses (_The Lady from the Sea_, P. 57). ‘Why,\r\nI, too, live in something from which others are shut out.’ In the same\r\npiece Wangel blames himself in this way (p. 130): ‘I ought to have been\r\nat once a father to her and a guide; I ought to have done my best to\r\ndevelop and enlighten her mind. Unfortunately, nothing ever came of\r\nthat.... I preferred her just as she was.’ In _The Pillars of Society_\r\nMrs. Bernick bemoans (p. 141): ‘For many years I believed that I had at\r\none time possessed you and lost you again. Now I know that I have never\r\npossessed you.’ And Lona Hessel draws the moral from this story (p. 97):\r\n\r\n And do you never think what she might have been to you--she, whom you\r\n chose in my stead?\r\n\r\n BERNICK. I know, at any rate, that she has been to me nothing of what\r\n I required.\r\n\r\n LONA. Because you have never shared your life-work with her; because\r\n you have never placed her in a free and true relation to you.\r\n\r\nIn _Rosmersholm_ Rector Kroll has treated his wife in the same way;\r\nhe has intellectually suppressed her, and is painfully surprised when\r\nshe finally revolts against the domestic tyrant who has extinguished\r\nher mental light (p. 14). ‘My wife, who all her life long has shared\r\nmy opinions and concurred in my views both in great things and small,\r\nis actually inclined to side with the children on many points. And\r\nshe blames me for what has happened. She says I tyrannize over the\r\nchildren. As if it weren’t necessary to. Well, you see how my house is\r\ndivided against itself. But, of course, I say as little about it as\r\npossible. It’s best to keep such things quiet.’\r\n\r\nUpon this point also there may be complete agreement. Most assuredly\r\nshould marriage be not merely a union of bodies, but also a community\r\nof minds; most assuredly should the man help and educate the wife\r\nintellectually, although it is to be remarked that this _rôle_ of\r\nteacher and guardian assigned with justice by Ibsen to the man,\r\ndecisively excludes the full intellectual equality of the two married\r\nparties equally claimed by him. But how can one reconcile with these\r\nnotions about the true relation between the man and his wife Nora’s\r\nwords to her husband (_A Doll’s House_, p. 111): ‘I must first try to\r\neducate myself. In that you are not the man to help me. I must set to\r\nwork alone. And that is why I am going away from you now.... I must\r\nbe thrown entirely upon myself’? We rub our eyes and ask ourselves if\r\nwe have read aright. What, then, is the duty of the husband in ‘true\r\nmarriage’? Shall he help his wife intellectually? Wangel, Mrs. Bernick,\r\nLona, Mrs. Kroll, say so. But Nora furiously denies it, and repels all\r\nassistance. _Farà da se!_ She will educate and form herself. As though\r\nthis contradiction were not already sufficiently bewildering, Ibsen\r\nstill further mocks those pitiable souls, who would fain obtain rules\r\nof morality from him, when, in _The Wild Duck_, he derides, as he is\r\nwont, all that he has preached on the subject of ‘true marriage’ in\r\nall the rest of his pieces. In that production a delicious dialogue\r\nis brought about between the malevolent idiot Gregers and the scoffer\r\nRelling (p. 337):\r\n\r\n GREGERS. [I want] to lay the foundations of a true marriage.\r\n\r\n RELLING. So you don’t find Ekdal’s marriage good enough as it is?\r\n\r\n GREGERS. No doubt it’s as good a marriage as most others, worse luck.\r\n But a _true_ marriage it has never been.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. You have never had eyes for the claims of the ideal, Relling.\r\n\r\n RELLING. All rubbish, my boy! But, excuse me, Mr. Werle, how many ...\r\n true marriages have you seen in the course of your life?\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Scarcely a single one.\r\n\r\n RELLING. Nor I, either.\r\n\r\nAnd still more incisive is the mockery contained in Hjalmar’s words\r\n(p. 345): ‘Well, then, isn’t it exasperating to think that it’s not I,\r\nbut he (Werle, senior), who will realize the true marriage?... Isn’t\r\nthe marriage between your father and Mrs. Sœrby founded upon complete\r\nconfidence, upon entire and unreserved candour on both sides? They\r\nhide nothing from each other. Their relation is based, if I may put it\r\nso’ (!) ‘on mutual confession and absolution.’ Hence no one has yet\r\nseen a ‘true marriage’; and when by chance this miracle does happen\r\nit is fulfilled in the case of Mr. Werle and Mrs. Sœrby--Mr. Werle,\r\nwho confesses to his wife that he has seduced young girls and sent old\r\nfriends to prison in his place--Mrs. Sœrby, who confides to her husband\r\nthat she has had illicit relations with every imaginable sort of man.\r\nIt is a tame imitation of the scene in _Raskolnikow_ by Dostojewski,\r\nwhere the assassin and the prostitute, after a contrite confession,\r\nunite their soiled and broken lives; except that in Ibsen the scene\r\nis stripped of its sombre grandeur and lowered to the ridiculous and\r\nvulgar.\r\n\r\nWith Ibsen, when women discover that they are not living in ‘true\r\nmarriage,’ their husband suddenly becomes ‘a strange man,’ and, without\r\nfurther ceremony, they abandon their home and their children, some,\r\nlike Nora, ‘to return to their birthplace,’ where ‘it will be easier\r\nfor me to get something to do of one sort or another’; others, like\r\nEllida, without giving a thought to what will become of them; others,\r\nagain, like Mrs. Alving and Hedda Gabler, to rush full speed to a lover\r\nand throw themselves on his neck. Ibsen has even deliciously parodied\r\nthis last departure, and in a doubly grotesque fashion, for he assigns\r\nthe laughable _rôle_ of the tragic runaway to a man. ‘I must out into\r\nthe snow and tempest,’ declaims Hjalmar (_The Wild Duck_, p. 166),\r\n‘and seek from house to house a shelter for my old father and myself.’\r\nAnd he really goes, but naturally only to return home the next day,\r\ncrestfallen, but stout-hearted, to breakfast. Truly nothing more need\r\nbe said against the idiocy of Nora’s high-flown leave-taking, which has\r\nbecome the gospel for the hysterical of both sexes, since Ibsen spared\r\nus this trouble in creating his Hjalmar.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet done with Ibsen’s drivel on the subject of marriage. He\r\nseems to exact that no girl should marry before she is fully matured,\r\nand possesses an experience of life and a knowledge of the world and of\r\nmen (_A Dolls House_, p. 111):\r\n\r\n NORA. And I--how have I been prepared to educate the children?... For\r\n that task I am not ready.... I must first try to educate myself....\r\n I cannot be satisfied any longer with what most people say, and with\r\n what is in books.\r\n\r\n HELMER. You don’t understand the society in which you live.\r\n\r\n NORA. No, no more I do. But now I will set to work and learn it.\r\n\r\nThis necessary maturity the young girl best acquires by going in quest\r\nof adventures, by becoming closely acquainted with the largest possible\r\nnumber of persons, to make a trial, if possible, of a few men before\r\nbinding herself definitely. A young girl is thoroughly prepared for\r\nmarriage when she has attained to a respectable age, managed a few\r\nhouseholds, perhaps also given birth to sundry children, and in this\r\nway proved to herself and others that she understands the duties of\r\na housewife and a mother. Ibsen does not expressly say this, but it\r\nis the only reasonable conclusion which can be deduced from the whole\r\nseries of his plays. The great reformer has no suspicion that he is\r\nhere preaching something long ago tried by mankind and rejected as\r\nunsuitable, or not more suitable. Experimental marriage for a longer\r\nor shorter period, the preference for brides endowed with a rich\r\nexperience in love-affairs and sundry children, all this has already\r\nexisted. Ibsen may learn all that he needs on this subject from\r\nhis half-compatriot, Professor Westermarck.[341] But he would be no\r\ndegenerate if he did not regard as progress the return to conditions\r\nof the most primitive character long since gone by, and if he did not\r\nmistake the far-away past for the future.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate his marriage-canon as gained from his dramas. There\r\nshould be no marriage from interest (Hedda, Mrs. Alving, Bernick,\r\netc.). There should be no marriage from love (Nora, Wangel). A marriage\r\nof prudence is not a true marriage. But to marry because each pleases\r\nthe other is equally good for nothing. To enter into matrimony with the\r\nfull approbation of reason, there should be first of all a thorough\r\nknowledge of each other by the contracting parties (Ellida). The man\r\nshould be the woman’s instructor and educator (Wangel, Bernick). The\r\nwife should not allow herself to be instructed and educated by the\r\nhusband, but acquire the necessary knowledge quite alone (Nora). If the\r\nwife discovers that her marriage is not a ‘true marriage,’ she leaves\r\nthe husband, for he is a stranger (Nora, Ellida). She also abandons her\r\nchildren, for children which she has had by a stranger are naturally\r\nstrangers also. She must, however, at the same time remain with the\r\nhusband, and endeavour to transform him from a stranger into her own\r\nhusband (Mrs. Bernick). Marriage is not intended permanently to unite\r\ntwo beings. When anything in the one is not agreeable to the other,\r\nthey return the ring and go their respective ways (Nora, Mr. Alving,\r\nEllida, Mrs. Elvsted). If a man abandons his wife he commits a heinous\r\ncrime (Bernick, Werle). And, to sum up, there is no true marriage\r\n(Relling). This is Ibsen’s doctrine concerning marriage. It leaves\r\nnothing to be desired in the matter of clearness. It amply suffices for\r\nthe diagnosis of the state of the Norwegian poet’s intellect.\r\n\r\nIndependently of his religious obsessions and his bewildering\r\ncontradictions, Ibsen’s mysticism reveals itself, step by step, in\r\nabsurdities of which a healthy intellect would be incapable. We have\r\nseen in _The Lady from the Sea_ that Ellida wishes to abandon her\r\nhusband, because her marriage is not a true one, and because her\r\nhusband has become a stranger to her. Why is he a stranger to her?\r\nBecause he has married her without mutual close acquaintance. ‘You\r\nhad only seen me and spoken a few words to me.’ She ought not to have\r\nlet herself be provided for. ‘Rather the meanest labour, rather the\r\nmost wretched surroundings, so long as they were the result of free\r\nwill, of free choice.’ From this one can only reasonably conclude that\r\nEllida is of the opinion no true marriage is possible, unless the\r\nwoman possesses a thorough knowledge of her suitor and has had full\r\nfreedom in her choice. She is convinced that these conditions existed\r\nin the case of the first claimant for her hand. ‘The first--that might\r\nhave been a complete and real marriage.’ Now, the same Ellida, a few\r\npages before (78), says that she knew absolutely nothing concerning her\r\nlover; she did not even know his name, and, as a matter of fact, he is\r\nspoken of throughout the piece only as ‘the stranger.’\r\n\r\n WANGEL. What else do you know about him?\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. Only that he went to sea very young; and that he had been on\r\n long voyages.\r\n\r\n WANGEL. Is there nothing more?\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. No; we never spoke of such things.\r\n\r\n WANGEL. Of what did you speak, then?\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. About the sea!\r\n\r\nAnd she betrothed herself to him\r\n\r\n Because he said I must.\r\n\r\n WANGEL. You must? Had you no will of your own, then?\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. Not when he was near.\r\n\r\nSo, then, Ellida is forced to abandon Wangel for the reason that,\r\npreviously to her marriage with him, she did not thoroughly know him,\r\nand she must go to ‘the stranger,’ of whom she knows nothing. Her\r\nmarriage with Wangel is no marriage, because she did not enter into\r\nit with perfect freedom of will, but the marriage with ‘the stranger’\r\nwill be ‘perfect and pure,’ although when she betrothed herself to him\r\nshe had ‘no will of her own.’ After this example of his mental maze,\r\nit is truly humiliating to be obliged to waste more words concerning\r\nthe intellectual state of such a man. But since this man is foisted\r\nby fools and fanatics to the rank of a great moralist and poet of the\r\nfuture, the psychiatrical observer must not spare himself the labour of\r\nreferring to his other absurdities.\r\n\r\nIn this same _Lady from the Sea_, Ellida renounces her project of\r\nleaving her husband Wangel, and going away with the ‘stranger,’ as soon\r\nas Wangel says ‘with aching heart’: ‘Now you can choose your own path\r\nin perfect freedom.’ She remains with Wangel. She chooses him. ‘Whence\r\ncame the change?’ asks Wangel and the reader with him. ‘Ah, don’t you\r\nunderstand,’ Ellida gushingly replies, ‘that the change came--was bound\r\nto come--when I could choose in freedom!’ (p. 141). This second choice,\r\nthen, is intended to form a complete contrast to the first, in which\r\nEllida plighted her troth to Wangel. But all the conditions, without a\r\nsingle exception, have remained the same. Ellida is now free because\r\nWangel expressly gives her her freedom; but she was still freer on the\r\nfirst occasion, because Wangel had as yet no rights over her, and did\r\nnot need to begin by setting her free. As little was external coercion\r\nexercised on her at the betrothal as subsequently after marriage.\r\nHer resolution depended then, as now, entirely on herself. If at the\r\nbetrothal she felt herself fettered, it was, as she herself explains,\r\nbecause she was at that time poor, and allowed herself to be enticed\r\nby the alluring prospect of being provided for. But in this respect\r\nnothing has changed. She has come into no property since her marriage,\r\nso far as we know from Ibsen. She is just as poor as she ever was. If\r\nshe quits Wangel, she will sink once more into the penury she found\r\ninsupportable when a young girl. If she remains with him, she is quite\r\nas much provided for as she hoped to be when she betrothed herself\r\nto him. Wherein, then, lies the contrast between her former want of\r\nliberty and her present freedom to explain the change? There is none.\r\nIt exists in the confused thought of Ibsen alone. If the whole of this\r\npiratical story about Ellida, Wangel, and the stranger is intended to\r\nmean, or to prove, anything, it can only be that a woman must first\r\nlive a few years with her husband on trial before she can bind herself\r\ndefinitively; and that her decision may be valid, she is to be free at\r\nthe end of the period of probation to go or to stay. The only meaning\r\nof the piece is, therefore, pure idiocy--experimental marriage.\r\n\r\nWe find the same absurdity repeated, in the fundamental idea, in the\r\npremises and deductions of nearly all his plays. In _Ghosts_ Oswald\r\nAlving’s disease is represented as a chastisement for the sins of\r\nhis father, and for the moral weakness of his mother in marrying\r\nfor self-interest a man she did not love. Now, Oswald’s state is\r\nthe consequence of a complaint which may be contracted without any\r\ndepravity whatsoever. It is a silly antiquated idea of the bigoted\r\nmembers of societies for the suppression of immorality that a\r\ncontagious disease is the consequence and punishment of licentiousness.\r\nDoctors know better than that. They know hundreds--nay, thousands--of\r\ncases where a young man is infected for his whole life, for no\r\nother act than one which, with the views now prevailing, is looked\r\nupon as venial. Even holy matrimony is no protection against such a\r\nmisfortune, to say nothing of the cases where doctors, nurses, etc.,\r\nhave contracted the malady in the discharge of their duties, and\r\nwithout carnal transgression. Ibsen’s drivel proves nothing of that\r\nwhich, according to him, it should prove. Chamberlain Alving might be\r\na monster of immorality without for that reason falling ill, or having\r\nan insane son; and his son could be insane without more culpability\r\non the part of the father than is the case with all men who have been\r\nunchaste before marriage. Ibsen, however, gives obtrusive evidence of\r\nhaving had no wish to write a tract in praise of continence, by making\r\nMrs. Alving throw herself into the arms of Pastor Manders, and by\r\nmaking the mother the intermediary of an illicit union out of wedlock\r\nbetween the son and his own sister, putting, moreover, into the mouth\r\nof Oswald a panegyric on concubinage--one of the most incredible things\r\nmet with in the incredible Ibsen. ‘What are they to do?’ replies Oswald\r\nAlving to the horrified pastor. ‘A poor young artist--a poor young\r\ngirl. It costs a lot of money to get married.’ I can only suppose that\r\nthe innocent Norwegian villager has never with his own bodily eyes seen\r\na ‘free union,’ and that he has drawn his idea of one from the depths\r\nof a nature filled with anarchistic rage against the existing order of\r\nthings. An inhabitant of any large town, having daily opportunities for\r\ngetting insight into dozens and hundreds of free unions, will burst\r\ninto hearty laughter over Ibsen’s infantine fantasies, worthy of a\r\nlascivious schoolboy. In no country in the world does civil marriage\r\ncost more than a trifling sum, very much less than the first repast\r\noffered by a young fellow to the girl he has persuaded to live with\r\nhim; and religious marriage, far from costing anything, brings to the\r\nbridal couple a donation in money, clothes, and household articles,\r\nif they are indelicate enough to accept them. Pious societies, which\r\nexpend large sums of money in legalizing free unions, exist everywhere.\r\nWhen persons form unions without the aid of the civil law or of\r\npriests, it is probably never for the purpose of saving the expense of\r\nmarriage, but either from culpable levity, or because either one or\r\nother of them makes a mental reservation not to bind him or herself,\r\nbut to enjoy something agreeable without undertaking any serious\r\nduties; or, finally, in the few cases which a moral man may approve,\r\nor, at least, excuse, because on one side or the other there exists\r\nsome legal obstacle above which they raise themselves, strong in love,\r\nand justified in their own eyes by the earnestness of their intention\r\nto be faithful to each other unto death.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this subordinate absurdity to the capital absurdity\r\nof the piece. Chamberlain Alving is punished for his illicit indulgence\r\nin carnal pleasure, in his own body, and in his children Oswald\r\nand Regina. That is very edifying, and would, doubtless, meet with\r\napprobation at a conference of clergymen, although nonsensical and\r\ninaccurate to the highest degree. We will only mention in passing that\r\nIbsen constantly recommends and glorifies unchastity, the ‘living out\r\none’s life.’ But what inference does Mrs. Alving draw from the case of\r\nher husband? That all should remain chaste and pure, an idea worked out\r\nby Bjornson in his _Glove_? No. She is led by it to the conclusion that\r\nthe existing order of morals and the law are bad. ‘Oh, that perpetual\r\nlaw and order!’ she exclaims (p. 154); ‘I often think it is that which\r\ndoes all the mischief here in the world.... I can endure all this\r\nconstraint and cowardice no longer. It is too much for me. I must work\r\nmy way out to freedom.’ What in the world has Alving’s story to do\r\nwith ‘law and order?’ and how does ‘freedom’ enter into this _Credo_?\r\nWhat connection with the piece have the silly speeches of this woman,\r\nunless it be that they are lugged in to tickle the radical patrons\r\nof the gallery into applause. In Tahiti neither ‘order’ nor ‘morals’\r\nreign in the sense given them by Mrs. Alving. There the brown beauties\r\nhave all the ‘freedom’ to which Mrs. Alving wishes to ‘work her way\r\nout,’ and the men so ‘live out their lives’ that ships’ officers,\r\nnot otherwise modest, avert their eyes with shame. And in that very\r\nregion Chamberlain Alving’s disease is so widespread that, according to\r\nIbsen’s medical theory, all the young Tahitians must be Oswalds.\r\n\r\nBut this is a constant habit of Ibsen’s, evidenced in all his pieces.\r\nHe puts into the mouth of his characters phrases used for effect by\r\norators in popular meetings of the lowest class, having nothing in the\r\nleast to do with the piece. ‘I don’t know what religion is,’ Nora says\r\nin the well-known scene where she leaves her husband (p. 114). ‘... I\r\nknow nothing but what our clergyman told me when I was confirmed. He\r\nexplained that religion was this and that. When I have got quite away\r\nfrom here and am all by myself, then I will examine that matter too.\r\nI will see whether what our clergyman taught is true.... I have now\r\nlearnt, too, that the laws are different from what I thought they were;\r\nbut I can’t convince myself that they are right.’ Now her case has no\r\nrelation to the religious doctrine of Pastor Hansen and the excellence\r\nor badness of the laws. No law in the world concedes the right to a\r\nchild to sign her father’s name to a cheque without his knowledge, and\r\nall the laws of the world not only permit but compel a judge to inquire\r\ninto the motives of every misdemeanour, although Ibsen makes Krogstad\r\nthe mouthpiece of this idiocy (p. 39): ‘The laws inquire little into\r\nmotives.’ The whole of this scene, in view of which, however, the piece\r\nwas written, is foreign to the play, and does not originally spring\r\nfrom it. If Nora wishes to abandon her husband, it can only be on the\r\nsupposition that she has discovered he does not love her so devotedly\r\nas she had wished and hoped. The hysterical fool, however, utters\r\nan inflammatory diatribe against religion, law, and society (which\r\nare profoundly innocent of the weakness of character and absence of\r\nlove in her husband), and departs like a feminine Coriolanus shaking\r\nher fist at her fatherland. In _The Pillars of Society_ Bernick,\r\nwishing to confess his own baseness, introduces his avowal with the\r\nwords (p. 110): ‘Let everyone examine himself, and let us realize the\r\nprediction that from this evening we begin a new time. The old, with\r\nits tinsel, its hypocrisy, its hollowness, its lying propriety, and\r\nits pitiful cowardice, shall lie behind us like a museum,’ etc. ‘Speak\r\nfor yourself, Bernick, speak for yourself,’ one might well call out to\r\nthe old wind-bag, who in this sermonizing tone thus generalizes his\r\nown individual case. ‘I wish to speak of the great discovery that I\r\nhave made within the last few days,’ exclaims Stockmann in _An Enemy\r\nof the People_, ‘the discovery that all our spiritual sources of life\r\nare poisoned, and that our whole bourgeois society rests upon a soil\r\nteeming with the pestilence of lies.’ That may in itself be true; but\r\nnothing in the piece gives Stockmann the right to arrive reasonably\r\nat this conclusion. Even in Plato’s republic it might happen that a\r\nragamuffin, more foolish for that matter than wicked, should refuse\r\nto cleanse an infected spring, and only a fool could deduce from\r\nthis single fact, and from the conduct of a clique of Philistines in\r\nan impossible Norwegian village, the general proposition that ‘our\r\nwhole bourgeois society rests upon a soil teeming with the pestilence\r\nof lies.’ In _Rosmersholm_, Brendel says in an obscurely profound\r\nprophetic tone, which shudders with foreboding (p. 23): ‘We live in a\r\ntempestuous, an equinoctial age.’ This expression also, true enough\r\nin itself, strikes one like a blow in the eye in the place where it\r\noccurs, for _Rosmersholm_ has no connection with any definite period of\r\ntime; and it is not necessary to change a single essential word in the\r\npiece, in order to transport it at pleasure to the Middle Ages, or the\r\nage of the Roman emperors, to China, or the land of the Incas--to any\r\nage or any land where there are hysterical women and idiotic men.\r\n\r\nWe are familiar with the method pursued by brawlers who wish to pick a\r\nquarrel: ‘Sir, why did you look at me in that way?’ ‘Pardon me, I did\r\nnot look at you.’ ‘What! you say, then, that I lie?’ ‘I said nothing\r\nof the sort.’ ‘You give me the lie a second time. You must give me\r\nsatisfaction.’ This is Ibsen’s method. What he wishes is to denounce\r\nsociety, the state, religion, law, and morals in anarchistic phrases.\r\nInstead, however, of publishing them like Nietzsche, in brochures,\r\nhe sticks them into his pieces at haphazard, where they appear as\r\nunexpectedly as the couplets sung in the naïve farces of our fathers.\r\nCleanse Ibsen’s dramas of these pasted-on phrases, and even a Brandes\r\nwill no longer be able to trumpet them as ‘modern’ productions; there\r\nwill remain only a tissue of absurdities, belonging to no time or\r\nplace, in which here and there emerge single poetically fine scenes and\r\naccessory figures, not changing in the least the atrociousness of the\r\nwhole. In fact, Ibsen always begins by finding some thesis--_i.e._,\r\nsome anarchist phrase. Then he tries to find out beings and events\r\nwhich embody and prove his thesis, for which task, however, his\r\npoetical power, and, above all, his knowledge of life and men, are\r\ninsufficient. For he goes through the world without seeing it, and\r\nhis glance is always turned inward on himself. In contradiction to the\r\nsaying of the poet, ‘All that is human is alien to him,’ and his own\r\n‘I’ alone occupies him and absorbs his attention. He himself proclaims\r\nthis in a well-known poem wherein he says, ‘Life is a battle with the\r\nghost in the vaults of the heart and brain. To be a poet is to hold\r\njudgment day over one’s own self.’[342]\r\n\r\nThe ‘ghost in the heart and brain’ is the obsessions and impulses in\r\nconflict with which the life of the higher degenerate is certainly\r\nspent. It is as clear as day that a poem, which is nothing but a\r\n‘judgment day’ of the poet over himself, cannot be a mirror of\r\nuniversal human life, freely and broadly flowing, but simply the\r\nintricate arabesques adorning the walls of a distorted, isolated\r\nexistence. He sees the image of the world with the eye of an insect;\r\na diminutive single feature which shows itself to one of the polished\r\nfacets of such a discoidal eye, and which he perchance perceives,\r\nhe firmly seizes, and renders with distinctness. But he does not\r\ncomprehend its connection with the whole phenomenon, and his organ of\r\nvision is not able to span a large comprehensive picture. This explains\r\nthe fidelity to nature in petty details and quite accessory figures,\r\nwhile the chief events and central characters are always astonishingly\r\nabsurd and alien to all the realities of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is in _Brand_ that Ibsen’s absurdity apparently achieves its\r\ngreatest triumph. Northern critics have reiterated _ad nauseam_ that\r\nthis silly piece is a dramatic translation of Kierkegaard’s crazy\r\n‘Either-Or.’ Ibsen shows a fool who wishes to be ‘all or nothing,’\r\nand who preaches the same to his fellow-citizens. What he especially\r\nunderstands by these high-sounding words the piece nowhere reveals\r\nby a single syllable. Brand, however, succeeds in infecting his\r\nfellow-citizens with his madness, and one fine day they sally forth\r\nfrom the village and are led by him into impassable mountain solitudes.\r\nWhat his purpose is no one knows or suspects. The sexton, who seems\r\nto be somewhat less crazy than the others, finally becomes uneasy\r\nconcerning this wholly senseless mountain climbing, and asks whither\r\nBrand is really leading them, and what may be the object of this\r\nscramble. Whereupon Brand gives him the following wonderful information\r\n(p. 151): ‘How long will the struggle last?’ (viz., the climbing, for\r\nthere is no other struggle in this Act). ‘It lasts until life’s end.\r\nUntil you have sacrificed all; until you are freed from your compact;\r\nuntil that which you may wish for you shall wish for unswervingly.’\r\n(What this is which is to be wished for is not explained.) ‘Until\r\nevery doubt shall have vanished and nothing separates you from the\r\nAll or Nothing. And your sacrifices? All the gods which with you take\r\nthe place of the eternal God; the shining golden chains of slavery,\r\ntogether with the beds of your languid slothfulness. The reward of\r\nvictory? Unity of will, activity of faith, pureness of soul.’ Naturally\r\non listening to this ranting the good people ‘come to their senses and\r\ngo home,’ but the lunatic Brand is offended because his fellow-citizens\r\ndo not want to pant uphill in order to ‘wish for something\r\nunswervingly,’ to attain to ‘all or nothing,’ and to arrive at ‘unity\r\nof will.’ For it is ‘the all’ which seems to inhabit mountains; not\r\nmerely freedom, which an early poet sought for there. (‘Liberty dwells\r\nin the mountains,’ Schiller has said.)\r\n\r\nAnd yet Brand is a remarkable figure. In him Ibsen has unconsciously\r\ncreated a very instructive type of those deranged beings who run,\r\nspeak, and act at the bidding of a ruling impulse,[343] who with\r\nfurious passion are continually and reiteratingly talking of ‘the goal’\r\nwhich they wish to attain, but who neither themselves have a suspicion\r\nof what this goal really is, nor are in a position to indicate it to\r\nothers in an intelligible way. Brand thinks the power which impels\r\nhim is his inflexible iron will. It is in reality his inflexible\r\niron impulsion which his consciousness in vain seeks to grasp and to\r\ninterpret by the aid of a flood of unintelligible words.\r\n\r\nIbsen’s absurdity is not always so clearly apparent as in the examples\r\ncited. It frequently manifests itself in a blurred and indefinite\r\nphrase, plainly expressing the state of a mind which endeavours to\r\nformulate in words a nebulous representation springing up in it,\r\nbut which lacks the necessary power and loses itself in mechanical\r\nmutterings void of sense. There are three sorts of phrases of this\r\nkind to be distinguished in Ibsen. One kind say absolutely nothing,\r\nand contain no more of an idea than the ‘tra-la-la’ sung to a song of\r\nwhich one has forgotten the words. They are a symptom of a temporary\r\narrest of function[344] in the cerebral centres of ideation, and appear\r\nin healthy persons also in a state of extreme fatigue, under the form\r\nof incidental embarrassment, causing hesitation in speech. In persons\r\nsuffering from hereditary exhaustion they are continuously present.\r\nAnother kind affect an appearance of profundity and significant\r\nallusions, but exact observation recognises them as an empty jingle of\r\nwords devoid of all import. Finally, the third kind are such evident\r\nand unequivocal idiocy that even unprofessional listeners regard each\r\nother in consternation, and would feel it to be their duty to give\r\nhis family a gentle hint if they heard anything of the kind from one\r\nof their table companions at the habitual café. I will give some\r\nillustrations of each of these three kinds of phraseology.\r\n\r\nFirstly, phrases saying absolutely nothing, interpolated between\r\nintelligible words, and indicating a temporary paralysis of the centres\r\nof ideation.\r\n\r\nIn _The Lady from the Sea_ (p. 25) Lyngstrand says: ‘I am to a certain\r\nextent a little infirm.’[345] This ‘to a certain extent’ is admirable!\r\nLyngstrand, a sculptor, is speaking of his artistic projects (p. 51):\r\n\r\n As soon as I can set about it, I am going to try if I can produce a\r\n great work--a group, _as they call it_.\r\n\r\n ARNHOLM. Is there anything else?\r\n\r\n LYNGSTRAND. Yes, there is to be another figure--_a sort of apparition,\r\n as they say_.\r\n\r\nAs Ibsen makes Lyngstrand a fool, it might be believed that he\r\nintentionally put these idiotic turns of expression into the sculptor’s\r\nmouth. But in _Hedda Gabler_, Brack, a sharp and clever _bon vivant_,\r\nsays (p. 87): ‘But as far as regards myself, you know very well that\r\nI have always entertained a--a certain respect for the marriage tie,\r\n_generally speaking_, Mrs. Hedda.’ In _Rosmersholm_ Brendel says (p.\r\n24): ‘So you see when golden dreams descended and enwrapped me ... I\r\nfashioned them into poems, into visions, into pictures--_in the rough_,\r\nas it were, you understand. Oh, what pleasures, what intoxications I\r\nhave enjoyed in my time! The mysterious bliss of creation--_in the\r\nrough_, as I said.’ Rector Kroll says (p. 18): ‘A family that now soon\r\nfor some centuries has held its place as the first in the land.’[346]\r\n‘Now soon for some centuries’! That means that it is not yet ‘some\r\ncenturies,’ but ‘soon’ will be ‘some centuries.’ Hence ‘soon’ must\r\ninclude in itself ‘some centuries.’ By what miracle? In _The Wild Duck_\r\nwe have the intentionally, but, in their exaggeration impossibly,\r\nidiotic conversations of the ‘fat,’ ‘bald,’ and ‘short-sighted’\r\ngentlemen in the first act, but also this remark by Gina, who is in no\r\nway depicted as an idiot (p. 270):\r\n\r\n Are you glad when you have some good news to tell father when he comes\r\n home in the evening?\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. Yes, for then we have a pleasanter time.\r\n\r\n GINA. Yes, _there is something [true][347] in that_!!\r\n\r\nIn the conversation about the wild duck between Ekdal, Gregers and\r\nHjalmar we read (p. 289):\r\n\r\n EKDAL. He was out in a boat, _you see_, and he shot her. But father’s\r\n sight is pretty bad now. H’m; he only wounded her.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Ah! she got a couple of shot in her body, I suppose.\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Yes, _two or three_....\r\n\r\n GREGERS. And she thrives all right in the garret there?\r\n\r\n HJALMAR. Yes, wonderfully well. She’s got fat. She’s been in there\r\n so long now that she’s forgotten her natural wild life, and it all\r\n depends on that.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. _You’re right there_, Hjalmar.\r\n\r\nAnd in a dialogue between Hedwig and Gregers Werle (p. 305):\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. ... If I had learnt basket-making, I could have made the new\r\n basket for the wild duck.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. So you could; and it was, strictly speaking, your business,\r\n wasn’t it?\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. Yes, for she’s _my_ wild duck.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. _Of course she is!_\r\n\r\nNow for some examples of phrases which sound excessively profound, but\r\nin reality express nothing, or mere foolishness.\r\n\r\nIn _A Doll’s House_ (p. 25) Mrs. Linden expresses the opinion: ‘Well,\r\nafter all, it is better to open the door to the sick, and get them safe\r\nin;’ to which Rank significantly replies: ‘Yes, so people say. And it\r\nis that very consideration which turns society into a hospital.’ What\r\ndoes this meditative and oracular speech mean? Is it Rank’s opinion\r\nthat society is a hospital because it cares for its sick, and that it\r\nwould be healthy if its sick were not cared for? Would the untended\r\nsick be any less sick? If he believes that he believes an idiocy. Or\r\nare the sick to be left to die uncared for, and in this manner got rid\r\nof? If he preaches that, he preaches a barbarism and a crime, and that\r\nis not in accordance with Rank’s character as Ibsen depicts him. We may\r\nturn and twist the vague, mysterious words as we will, we shall always\r\nfind either stupidity or want of meaning.\r\n\r\nIn _Rosmersholm_, Rosmer (p. 30) wishes to ‘devote all his life and\r\nall his energies to this one thing--the creation of a true democracy\r\nin this country.’ And, wonderful to relate, the persons to whom Rosmer\r\nsays these words all seem to comprehend what the ‘true democracy’\r\nis. Without being asked, Rosmer offers, besides, some explanation of\r\nhis Pythian utterance: ‘I want to awaken the democracy to its true\r\ntask--that of making all the people of this country noblemen ... by\r\nsetting free their minds and purifying their wills.... I will only try\r\nto arouse them to their task. They themselves must accomplish it ...\r\nby their own strength. There is no other.... Peace and joy and mutual\r\nforbearance must once more enter into their souls.’ Rebecca repeats to\r\nhim his programme (p. 62):\r\n\r\n You were to set resolutely to work in the world--the living world of\r\n to-day, as you said. You were to go as a messenger of emancipation\r\n from home to home; to win over minds and wills; to create noble men\r\n around you in wider and wider circles. Noblemen.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. Joyful noblemen.\r\n\r\n REBECCA. Yes, joyful.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. For it is joy that ennobles the mind.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid calling up a comic picture of Rosmer going\r\n‘from home to home’ ‘in wider and wider circles,’ and making the\r\npersons before whom he talks into ‘joyful noblemen,’ while he ‘awakens’\r\nthem and ‘purifies their wills,’ and thus ‘creates a true democracy.’\r\nThis rigmarole is, it is true, incomprehensible; but, at all events, it\r\nmust be something agreeable, for Rosmer expressly says that he needs\r\n‘joy’ to create ‘noblemen.’ And in spite of this Rebecca suddenly\r\ndiscovers (p. 102): ‘The Rosmer view of life ennobles, but it kills\r\nhappiness.’ What! Rosmer kill happiness when he ‘goes from home to\r\nhome,’ awakening, winning, making people free, etc., and creating\r\njoyful noblemen? The word ‘joyful’ includes, at least, something of\r\nhappiness, and yet the education of men to ‘joyful noblemen’ is to\r\nkill happiness? Rosmer finds (p. 97) ‘the work of ennobling men’s\r\nminds is not for him. And, besides, it is so hopeless in itself.’\r\nThis is in a measure intelligible, though it is not stated from what\r\nexperience Rosmer has been led to such a change in his views. But quite\r\nbeyond comprehension is Rebecca’s speech about the fatal influence\r\nof ‘the Rosmer view of life.’ In _Ghosts_, Mrs. Alving endeavours\r\nto explain her defunct husband’s vagaries in this balderdash (p.\r\n187): ‘When he was a young lieutenant, he was brimming over with the\r\njoy of life. It was like a breezy day only to look at him. And what\r\nexuberant strength and vitality there was in him! And then, child of\r\njoy as he was--for he _was_ like a child at the time--he had to live\r\nhere at home in a half-grown town, which had no joys to offer him,\r\nbut only amusements. He had no object in life, but only an office.\r\nHe had no work into which he could throw himself heart and soul; he\r\nhad only business. He had not a single comrade that knew what the joy\r\nof life meant, only loungers and boon companions.’ These antitheses\r\nseem to have something in them; but if we seriously set about hunting\r\nfor a definite idea in them, they vanish in smoke. ‘Object in\r\nlife--office’--‘work--business’--‘comrades--boon companions,’ are not\r\nin themselves oppositions, but become such through the individual.\r\nWith a decent man they are perfectly coincident; with a base man they\r\nfall into opposition. A large or a small town has nothing to do with\r\nit. For Kant in the small town of Kœnigsberg, in the last century,\r\nthe ‘office’ was ‘the object in life,’ ‘work’ was ‘business,’ and he\r\nso chose his ‘boon companions’ that they were at the same time his\r\n‘comrades,’ as far, indeed, as he could have such. And, on the other\r\nhand, there is, in the largest metropolis, no occupation and no circle\r\nof men in which a degenerate, burdened with his disorder, could feel at\r\nease and in inward harmony.\r\n\r\nIn _Hedda Gabler_ we find quite a multitude of such words, apparently\r\nsaying much, but in reality saying nothing. ‘It was the passion for\r\nlife in you!’ exclaims Lövborg to Hedda (p. 128), with the seeming\r\nconviction that he has, in this utterance, explained something to her.\r\nAnd Hedda says (p. 142): ‘_I_ see him before me. With vine-leaves in\r\nhis hair. Hot and bold’ (p. 151). ‘And Ejlert Lövborg, he is sitting\r\nwith vine-leaves in his hair, and reading aloud’ (p. 157). ‘Had he\r\nvine-leaves in his hair?’ (p. 171). ‘So that is how it all happened.\r\nThen he did not have vine-leaves in his hair’ (p. 188).\r\n\r\n HEDDA. Could you not contrive that it should be done gracefully?\r\n\r\n LÖVBORG. Gracefully? With vine-leaves in my hair?\r\n\r\n‘With vine-leaves in his hair;’ ‘the passion for life’--these are\r\nwords meaning, in the connection assigned to them, absolutely nothing,\r\nbut giving scope for dreaming. In a few instances Ibsen employs these\r\ndreamily-nebulous, shadowy expressions with poetic licence, _e.g._,\r\nwhen we read in _The Pillars of Society_ (p. 19):\r\n\r\n RÖRLUND. Tell me, Dina, why you do like so much to be with me?\r\n\r\n DINA. Because you teach me so much that is beautiful.\r\n\r\n RÖRLUND. Beautiful? Do you call what I can teach you beautiful?\r\n\r\n DINA. Yes; or, rather, you teach me nothing; but when I hear you\r\n speak, it makes me think of so much that is beautiful.\r\n\r\n RÖRLUND. What do you understand, then, by a beautiful thing?\r\n\r\n DINA. I have never thought of that.\r\n\r\n RÖRLUND. Then think of it now. What do you understand by a beautiful\r\n thing?\r\n\r\n DINA. A beautiful thing is something great and far away.\r\n\r\nDina is a young girl living under sad and painful conditions. It is\r\npsychologically accurate that she should condense all her longing\r\nfor a new and happy existence in a word of emotional colouring, such\r\nas ‘beautiful.’ It is the same with the dialogue between Gregers and\r\nHedwig in _The Wild Duck_ (p. 53):\r\n\r\n GREGERS. And she [the wild duck] has been down in the depths of the\r\n sea.\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. Why do you say ‘in the depths of the sea’?\r\n\r\n GREGERS. What else could I say?\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. You could say ‘the bottom of the sea’ [or ‘at the bottom of\r\n the water’].[348]\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Oh, mayn’t I just as well say the depths of the sea?\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. Yes; but it sounds so strange to me when other people speak of\r\n the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\n GREGERS. Why so?...\r\n\r\n HEDWIG. ... It always seems to me that the whole room and everything\r\n in it should be called the depths of the sea. But that’s so stupid....\r\n Because it’s only a garret [the place where the wild duck lives, the\r\n old Christmas-trees are put, where old Ekdal chases the rabbit, etc.].\r\n\r\nHedwig is a highly excitable child at the age of puberty (Ibsen thinks\r\nit necessary expressly to affirm that her voice is changing, and that\r\nshe willingly plays with fire); hence it is natural that she should be\r\nthrilled with presentiments, dreams, and obscure instincts, and invest\r\npoetical expressions denoting something far away and wild, such as\r\n‘in the depths of the sea,’ with the secret significance of all the\r\nmysterious and marvellous surging in her. But when expressions of this\r\nsort are used, not by little growing girls, but by full-grown persons\r\ndepicted as rational beings, it is no longer a question of dreaming\r\nexplicable on pathological grounds, but of diseased cerebral centres.\r\n\r\nThese words often assume the nature of an obsession. Ibsen obstinately\r\nrepeats them, at the same time imparting to them a mysterious\r\nsignificance. It is thus, for example, that the words ‘joy of life’\r\nappear in _Ghosts_ (p. 176):\r\n\r\n OSWALD. ... She was full of the joy of life (p. 177).\r\n\r\n MRS. ALVING. What were you saying about the joy of life?\r\n\r\n OSWALD. Have you noticed that everything I have painted has turned\r\n upon the joy of life?--always, always upon the joy of life? (p. 187).\r\n\r\n MRS. ALVING. You spoke of the joy of life; and at that word a new\r\n light burst for me over my life and all it has contained.... You ought\r\n to have known your father.... He was brimming over with the joy of\r\n life.\r\n\r\nIn _Hedda Gabler_ the word ‘beauty’ plays a similar part (p. 190):\r\n\r\n HEDDA (_to_ Lövborg). _You_ use it [the pistol] now.... And do it\r\n beautifully (p. 214).\r\n\r\n _Hedda._ I say that there is something beautiful in this [Lövborg’s\r\n suicide] (p. 219).\r\n\r\n HEDDA. A relief to know that it is still possible for an act of\r\n voluntary courage to take place in the world. Something over which\r\n there falls a veil of unintentional beauty.... And then now--the great\r\n act! That over which the sense of beauty falls!\r\n\r\nThe ‘vine-leaves in the hair,’ in the same piece, belongs with equal\r\nexactness to this category of words, amounting to an obsession. The\r\nuse of expressions full of mystery, incomprehensible to the hearer,\r\nand either freely coined by the speaker, or endowed by him with a\r\npeculiar sense, deviating from that usually assigned them in speech,\r\nis one of the most frequent phenomena among the mentally deranged.\r\nGriesinger[349] often lays stress on this, and A. Marie[350] adduces\r\nsome characteristic examples of words and phrases, either newly\r\ninvented or employed in a sense differing from the customary one, which\r\nhave been repeated by the insane.\r\n\r\nIbsen is certainly not wholly diseased in mind, but only a dweller on\r\nthe borderland--a ‘mattoid.’ His use of formalized expressions does\r\nnot therefore go so far as the invention of new words, as cited by Dr.\r\nMarie. But that he ascribes a mysterious meaning to the expressions\r\n‘beauty,’ ‘joy of life,’ ‘courage of life,’ etc., and one which they\r\ndo not possess when rationally used, follows clearly enough from the\r\nexamples quoted.\r\n\r\nFinally let us adduce a few specimens of sheer nonsense, corresponding\r\nto conversations held in dreams, and the silly rambling speech of\r\npersons suffering from fever or acute mania. In _The Lady from the\r\nSea_, Ellida says (p. 39): ‘The water in the fjord here is sick, ...\r\nyes, sick. And I believe it makes one sick, too’ (p. 79). ‘We’ (Ellida\r\nand the ‘stranger’) ‘spoke of the gulls and the eagles, and all the\r\nother sea-birds. I think--isn’t it wonderful?--when we talked of such\r\nthings it seemed to me as if both the sea-beasts and sea-birds were one\r\nwith him.... I almost thought I belonged to them all, too’ (p. 100).\r\n\r\n I don’t think the dry land is really our home.... I think that if only\r\n men had from the beginning accustomed themselves to live on the sea,\r\n or _in_ the sea, perhaps, we should be more perfect than we are--with\r\n better and happier....\r\n\r\n ARNHOLM (_jestingly_). Well, perhaps! But it can’t be helped. We’ve\r\n once for all entered upon the wrong path, and have become land-beasts\r\n instead of sea-beasts. Anyhow, I suppose it’s too late to make good\r\n the mistake now.\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. Yes, you’ve spoken a sad truth. And I think men instinctively\r\n feel something of this themselves. And they bear it about with them as\r\n a secret regret and sorrow. Believe me, herein lies the deepest cause\r\n for the sadness of men.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Wangel, who is depicted as a rational man, says (p. 129):\r\n\r\n And then she is so changeable, so capricious--she varies so suddenly.\r\n\r\n ARNHOLM. No doubt that is the result of her morbid state of mind.\r\n\r\n WANGEL. Not altogether. Ellida belongs to the sea-folk. That is the\r\n matter(!!).\r\n\r\nWe must insist that precisely the absurdities, the nugatory, blurred,\r\ndeep-sounding phrases, the formalized words, and the dream-like drivel,\r\nhave essentially conduced to obtain for Ibsen his particular admirers.\r\nOver them hysterical mystics can dream, like Dina and Hedwig, over\r\nthe words ‘beautiful’ and ‘in the depths of the sea.’ As they mean\r\nabsolutely nothing, an inattentive and vagrant mind can impart to them\r\nwhatever significance may be suggested by the play of association under\r\nthe influence of momentary emotion. They are, moreover, exceedingly\r\ngrateful material for the (so-called) ‘comprehensives,’ for whom\r\nnothing is ever obscure. ‘Comprehensives’ always explain everything.\r\nThe greater the idiocy, the more involved, the richer in import, the\r\nmore exhaustive is its interpretation, and the greater the arrogance\r\nwith which these beings of ‘perfect comprehension’ look down upon the\r\nbarbarian, who stoutly refuses to see in fustian anything but fustian.\r\n\r\nIn an exceedingly amusing French farce, _Le Homard_, a husband suddenly\r\nreturning home one evening surprises a stranger with his wife. The\r\nlatter does not lose her presence of mind, and says to the husband\r\nthat, having suddenly been seized with illness, she had sent her maid\r\nfor the first available doctor, and that this gentleman was the doctor.\r\nThe husband thanks the gallant for his speedy appearance, and asks if\r\nhe has already prescribed anything. The gallant, who, of course, is\r\nnot a doctor, tries to make himself scarce; but the anxious husband\r\ninsists on having a prescription, so that the Galen, bathed in cold\r\nperspiration, is compelled to give one. The husband casts a glance\r\nat it; it consists of wholly illegible marks. ‘And will the chemist\r\nbe able to read that?’ asks the husband, shaking his head. ‘As if it\r\nwere print,’ asseverates the false physician, again trying to make his\r\nescape. The husband, however, adjures him to remain, and holds him\r\nfast until the maid returns from the chemist. In a few minutes she\r\nmakes her appearance. The Galen prepares himself for a catastrophe.\r\nNo. The maid brings a phial of medicine, a box of pills, and some\r\npowders. ‘Did the chemist give you those?’ demands the Galen in\r\nbewilderment. ‘Certainly.’ ‘On my prescription?’ ‘Of course it was on\r\nyour prescription,’ replies the astonished maid. ‘Has the chemist made\r\nsome mistake?’ interposes the troubled husband. ‘No, no,’ our Galen\r\nhastens to reply; but he contemplates the medicines for a long time,\r\nand becomes lost in reverie.\r\n\r\nThese ‘comprehensives’ are like the chemist in _Le Homard_. They\r\nread with fluency all Ibsen’s prescriptions, and especially those\r\ncontaining absolutely no written characters, but simply crow’s feet\r\ndevoid of all meaning. It is also their trade to supply critical pills\r\nand electuaries when a piece of paper is brought to them bearing the\r\nsignature of a self-styled doctor, and they dispense them without\r\nwincing, be there anything of any sort, or even nothing, on the slip\r\nof paper. Is it not significant that the sole thing in Ibsen which the\r\nFrench mystic De Vogué, one of these ‘comprehensives,’ finds to praise\r\nis one of the meaningless phrases above cited?[351]\r\n\r\nA final stigma of Ibsen’s mysticism must be considered--his symbolism.\r\nIn _The Wild Duck_, this bird is the symbol of Hjalmar’s destiny, and\r\nthe garret next the photographic studio a symbol of the ‘living lie,’\r\nof which, according to Relling, everyone stands in need. In _The Lady\r\nfrom the Sea_, Lyngstrand wishes to make a group which shall be the\r\nsymbol of Ellida, as the ‘stranger’ with the changing eyes of a fish\r\nis of the sea and the latter again of freedom, so that the ‘stranger’\r\nis really the symbol of a symbol. In _Ghosts_, the burning of the\r\nasylum is the symbol of the annihilation of Alving’s ‘living lie,’ and\r\nthe rainy weather prevailing throughout the whole piece the symbol of\r\nthe depressed and sullen frame of mind of the personages in action.\r\nIbsen’s earlier pieces, _Emperor and Galilean_, _Brand_, _Peer Gynt_,\r\nliterally swarm with symbols. A mysterious collateral significance\r\nis given to every figure and every stage accessory, and every word\r\nincludes a double meaning. From the ‘Psychology of Mysticism’ we\r\nalready know this peculiarity of the mystic mind to divine obscure\r\nrelations between phenomena. It seeks so to explain the nexus of the\r\nwholly unconnected representations springing up in consciousness\r\nthrough the play of automatic association, that it attributes hidden\r\nbut essential reference to each other in these representations. The\r\n‘comprehensives’ believe they have said all when, with an extremely\r\nconsequential and self-satisfied air, they demonstrate that the\r\n‘stranger’ in _The Lady from the Sea_ signifies the sea, and the sea\r\nfreedom. They quite overlook the fact that the thing to be explained\r\nis not what the poet intended by his symbol, but, firstly, and in\r\nparticular, why he hit upon the idea of making use of a symbol at all.\r\nIn the well-known words of the French satirist, a clear-headed poet\r\ncalls ‘a cat a cat.’ That to express so sober an idea as that persons\r\nof fine feelings, living in narrow conditions, have a deep longing for\r\na free, expanded, unrestrained existence, one should have the whim\r\nto invent a ‘stranger with fish-like eyes,’ presupposes a diseased\r\nmental activity. In imbeciles, the tendency to allegory and symbolism\r\nis very common. ‘Intricate arabesques, symbolical figures, cabalistic\r\ngestures and attitudes, strange interpretations of natural events,\r\npunning, word-coining, and peculiar modes of expression, frequently\r\noccurring in paranoia, give the delirium a lively and grotesque\r\ncolouring.’ Thus writes Tanzi,[352] and in the symbolism of the insane\r\nhe saw, as Meynert had previously seen, a form of atavism. Among men\r\nlow in the grade of civilization symbolism is, in fact, the habitual\r\nform of thought. We know the reason--their brain is not yet trained\r\nto attention; it is too weak to suppress irrational associations,\r\nand refers all that shoots through its consciousness to some chance\r\nphenomenon either just perceived, or else remembered.\r\n\r\nAfter all the mental stigmata of Ibsen with which we have become\r\nacquainted--his theological obsessions of original sin, of confession\r\nand redemption, the absurdities of his invention, the constant\r\ncontradiction in his uncertain opinions, his vague or senseless modes\r\nof expression, his onomatomania and his symbolism--he might be numbered\r\namong the mystic degenerates with which I have concerned myself in the\r\nprevious chapters. We are, however, justified in assigning him his\r\nplace among the ego-maniacs, because the diseased intensification of\r\nhis ego-consciousness is even more striking and characteristic than\r\nhis mysticism. His ego-mania assumes the form of anarchism. He is in a\r\nstate of constant revolt against all that exists. He never exercises\r\nrational criticism with regard to this; he never shows what is bad,\r\nwhy it is bad, and how it could be made better. No; he only reproaches\r\nit with its existence, and has only one longing--to destroy it. ‘The\r\nruin of everything’ was the programme of certain destructives in 1848,\r\nand has remained that of Ibsen. He condenses it with a clearness which\r\nleaves nothing to be desired in his well-known poem, _To my Friend\r\nthe Destructive Orator_. In this he glorifies the deluge as the ‘sole\r\nrevolution not made by a half-and-half dabbler’ (_Halohedsfusker_); but\r\neven it was not radically ruinous enough. ‘We want to make it still\r\nmore radical, but for that end we need men and orators. You charge\r\nyourselves with flooding the terrestrial garden. I place blissfully\r\na torpedo under the ark.’[353] In a series of letters offered by\r\nelephant-driver Brandes for the edification of the adorers of Ibsen,\r\nthe poet gives conspicuous specimens of his theories.[354] The state\r\nmust be destroyed. Unfortunately the Paris Communists bungled this\r\nbeautiful and fertile idea by clumsy execution. The fight for freedom\r\nhas not for its end the conquest of liberty, but is its own end. As\r\nsoon as we believe liberty to be attained, and cease to fight for it,\r\nwe prove it to be lost to us. The meritorious thing in the fight for\r\nliberty is the state of permanent revolt against all existing things\r\nwhich it presupposes. There is nothing fixed and permanent. ‘Who\r\nwarrants me that in the planet Jupiter twice two are not five?’ (This\r\nremark is an unmistakable manifestation of the insanity of doubt,[355]\r\nwhich in recent years has been deeply studied.) There is no true\r\nmarriage. Friends are a costly luxury. ‘They have long hindered me\r\nfrom being myself.’ The care of the ‘I’ is the sole task of man. He\r\nought not to allow himself to be diverted from it by any law or any\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts, expressed by himself in his letters, he also puts into\r\nthe mouth of his dramatic characters. I have already cited some of\r\nMrs. Alving’s and Nora’s ego-maniacal and anarchical phrases. In _The\r\nPillars of Society_, Dina says (p. 19): ‘If only the people I lived\r\namongst weren’t so proper and moral. Every day Hilda and Netta come\r\nhere that I may take example by them. I can never be as well behaved as\r\nthey are, and I _won’t be_’ (p. 44).\r\n\r\n But I wanted to know, too, if people over there [in America] are\r\n very--very moral ... if they are so--so proper and well-behaved as\r\n here.\r\n\r\n JOHAN. Well, at any rate, they’re not so bad as people here think.\r\n\r\n DINA. You don’t understand me. What I want is just that they should\r\n not be so very proper and moral (p. 92). I am sick of all this\r\n goodness.\r\n\r\n MARTHA BERNICK. Oh, how we writhe under this tyranny of custom and\r\n convention! Rebel against it, Dina. Do something to defy all this\r\n use-and-wont!\r\n\r\nIn _An Enemy of the People_ (p. 278) Stockmann declares: ‘I detest\r\nleading men ... they stand in the path of a free man wherever he\r\nturns--and I should be glad if we could exterminate them like other\r\nnoxious animals.’ (p. 280) ‘The most dangerous enemies of truth and\r\nfreedom in our midst are the compact majority. Yes, this execrable\r\ncompact, Liberal majority--they it is.... The majority is never\r\nright.... The minority is always right.’ Where Ibsen does not seriously\r\nattack the majority he derides it--_e.g._, when he entrusts the\r\nmaintenance of society to grotesque Philistines, or makes self-styled\r\nRadicals betray the hypocrisy of their Liberal views. In _An Enemy of\r\nthe People_ (p. 238):\r\n\r\n BURGOMASTER. You want to fly in the face of your superiors; and that’s\r\n an old habit of yours. You can’t endure any authority over you\r\n\r\nIn _Rosmersholm_ (p. 53):\r\n\r\n MORTENSGAARD [the journalist who poses as a Freethinker]. We have\r\n plenty of Freethinkers already, Pastor Rosmer--I almost might say too\r\n many. What the party requires is a Christian element--something that\r\n everyone must respect. That’s what we’re sadly in need of.\r\n\r\nWith the same purpose of anarchistic ridicule he always personifies the\r\nsense of duty in idiots or contemptible Pharisees only. In _Ghosts_ the\r\nblockhead, Pastor Manders, thus preaches (p. 142): ‘What right have we\r\nhuman beings to happiness? No, we have to do our duty! And your duty\r\nwas to hold firmly to the man you had once chosen, and to whom you\r\nare bound by a holy tie.’ In _The Pillars of Society_ it is the rogue\r\nBernick who is made to proclaim the necessity of the subordination of\r\nthe individual to the community (p. 58): ‘People must learn to moderate\r\ntheir personal claims if they are to fulfil their duties in the\r\ncommunity in which they are placed.’ In _An Enemy of the People_ the\r\nnot less pitiable burgomaster sermonizes his brother Stockmann in this\r\nfashion (p. 209): ‘Anyhow, you’ve an ingrained propensity for going\r\nyour own way. And that in a well-ordered community is almost always\r\ndangerous. The individual must submit himself to the whole community.’\r\n\r\nThe trick is evident: to make the conception of the necessary\r\nsubordination of the individual ridiculous and contemptible, Ibsen\r\nappoints as its mouthpieces ridiculous and contemptible beings. On the\r\nother hand, it is the characters on whom he lavishes all the wealth\r\nof his affection to whom he entrusts the duty of defending rebellion\r\nagainst duty, the aspersion or derision of laws, morals, institutions,\r\nself-discipline, and the proclaiming of unscrupulous ego-mania as the\r\nsole guide of life.\r\n\r\nThe psychological roots of Ibsen’s anti-social impulses are well\r\nknown. They are the degenerate’s incapacity for self-adaptation, and\r\nthe resulting discomfort in the midst of circumstances to which, in\r\nconsequence of his organic deficiencies, he cannot accommodate himself.\r\n‘The criminal,’ Lombroso[356] says, ‘in consequence of his neurotic\r\nand impulsive nature, and his hatred of the institutions which have\r\npunished or imprisoned him, is a perpetual latent political rebel, who\r\nfinds in insurrection the means not only of satisfying his passions,\r\nbut of even having them countenanced for the first time by a numerous\r\npublic.’ This utterance is exactly applicable to Ibsen, with the slight\r\nchange, that he is merely a theoretic criminal, his motor centres not\r\nbeing powerful enough to transmute his anarchically criminal ideas into\r\ndeeds, and that he finds the satisfaction of his destructive impulses\r\nnot in the insurrection, but in the activity of dramatic composition.\r\n\r\nHis incapacity for self-adaptation makes him not only an anarchist, but\r\nalso a misanthrope, and fills him with a profound weariness of life.\r\nThe doctrine of _An Enemy of the People_ is contained in Stockmann’s\r\nexclamation (p. 315): ‘The strongest man on earth is he who stands most\r\nalone’; and in _Rosmersholm_ (p. 24), Brendel says: ‘I like to take my\r\npleasures in solitude, for then I enjoy them doubly.’ The same Brendel\r\nsubsequently laments (p. 105): ‘I am going homewards; I am home-sick\r\nfor the mighty Void.... Peter Mortensgaard never wills more than he can\r\ndo. Peter Mortensgaard is capable of living his life without ideals.\r\nAnd that, do you see, that is just the mighty secret of action and\r\nof victory. It is the sum of the whole world’s wisdom.... The dark\r\nnight is best. Peace be with you!’ Brendel’s words have a peculiar\r\nsignificance, for, on the evidence of Ehrhard,[357] Ibsen wished to\r\nportray himself in that personage. That which is expressed in these\r\npassages is the _dégoût des gens_ and the _tedium vitæ_ of alienists,\r\nphenomena never absent in depressed forms of mental alienation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his mysticism and ego-mania, Ibsen’s extraordinary\r\npoverty of ideas indicates another stigma of degeneracy. Superficial\r\nor ignorant judges, who appraise an artist’s intellectual wealth by\r\nthe number of volumes he has produced, believe that when they point\r\nat the high pile of a degenerate’s works they have victoriously\r\nrefuted the accusation of his infecundity. The well-informed are of\r\ncourse not entrapped by this paltry method of proof. The history of\r\ninsane literature knows of a large number of cases in which fools\r\nhave written and published dozens of thick volumes. For tens of\r\nyears and in feverish haste they must have driven the pen, almost\r\ncontinuously, night and day; but since all these bulky tomes contain\r\nnot a single idea of any utility, this restless activity is not to\r\nbe termed fruitful, in spite of the abundant typographical results.\r\nWe have seen that Richard Wagner never invented a tale, a figure, a\r\nsituation; but that he sponged on ancient poems or the Bible. Ibsen has\r\nalmost as little genuine original creative power as his intellectual\r\nrelative, and as he, in his beggar’s pride, disdains for the most part\r\nto borrow from other poets of procreative capacity, or from popular\r\ntraditions exuberant with life, his poems reveal, when closely and\r\nkeenly examined, an even greater poverty than those of Wagner. If we\r\ndo not allow ourselves to be dazzled by the art of variation in a\r\ncontrapuntist extraordinarily clever in dramatic technique, and follow\r\nthe themes he so adroitly elaborates, we at once recognise their dreary\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\nAt the central point of all his pieces (with the exception of those\r\nof a romantic character, written by him in his first period of pure\r\nimitation) stand two figures, always the same and fundamentally one,\r\nbut having now a negative and now a positive sign, a thesis and\r\nantithesis in the Hegelian sense. They are, on the one hand, the human\r\nbeing who obeys his inner law only (that is, his ego-mania), and\r\ndauntlessly and defiantly makes a parade of it; and, on the other, the\r\nindividual who, it is true, really acts in obedience to his ego-mania\r\nonly, but has not the courage to display it, feigning respect for the\r\nlaw of others and for the notions of the majority--in other words,\r\nthe avowed and violent anarchist, and his opposite, the crafty and\r\ntimorously deceitful anarchist.\r\n\r\nThe avowed ego-maniac is, with one single exception, always embodied\r\nin a woman. The exception is Brand. On the contrary, the hypocrite\r\nis always a man--again with a single exception, viz., that of Hedda\r\nGabler, who does not personify the idea in its purity, frank anarchism\r\nin her nature being mingled with something of hypocrisy. Nora (_A\r\nDoll’s House_), Mrs. Alving (_Ghosts_), Selma Malsberg (_The League\r\nof the Young_), Dina, Martha Hessel, Mrs. Bernick (_The Pillars of\r\nSociety_), Hedda Gabler, Ellida Wangel (_The Lady from the Sea_),\r\nRebecca (_Rosmersholm_), are one and the same figure, but seen, as it\r\nwere, at different hours of the day, and consequently in different\r\nlights. Some are in the major, others in the minor, key; some are\r\nmore, others less hysterically deranged; but essentially they are not\r\nonly similar, but identical. Selma Malsberg (p. 60) cries: ‘Bear our\r\nunhappiness in common? Am I yet good enough? No. I can no longer keep\r\nsilent, be a hypocrite and a liar. Now you shall know.... O, how you\r\nhave wronged me! Infamously, all of you!... How I have thirsted for a\r\ndrop of your care! But when I begged for it you repulsed me with a\r\npolite joke. You dressed me like a doll. You played with me as with a\r\nchild.... I want to go away from you.... Let me, let me.’ And Nora (p.\r\n110): ‘I lived by performing tricks for you, Torvald.... You and your\r\nfather have sinned greatly against me. It is the fault of you two that\r\nnothing has been made of me. I was never happy, only merry.... Our\r\nhouse has been nothing but a nursery. Here I have been your doll-wife,\r\njust as at home I used to be papa’s doll-child.... That is why I am\r\ngoing away from you now.... I shall now leave your house at once.’\r\nEllida (_The Lady from the Sea_): ‘What I want is that we should, of\r\nour own free will, release each other.... I am not what you took me\r\nfor. Now you see it yourself. Now we can separate as friends, and\r\nfreely.... Here there is no single thing that attracts me and binds me.\r\nI am so absolutely rootless in your house, Wangel.’ Selma threatens\r\nto leave, Ellida resolves to leave, Nora does leave, Mrs. Alving did\r\nleave. (_Ghosts_, p. 144) Pastor Manders: ‘All your efforts have been\r\nbent towards emancipation and lawlessness. You have never been willing\r\nto endure any bond. Everything that has weighed upon you in life you\r\nhave cast away without care or conscience, like a burden you could\r\nthrow off at will. It did not please you to be a wife any longer, and\r\nyou left your husband. You found it troublesome to be a mother, and you\r\nsent your child forth among strangers.’ Mrs. Bernick was, equally with\r\nher double, Mrs. Alving, a stranger in her own house. She, however,\r\ndoes not wish to leave, but to remain and endeavour to win over her\r\nhusband (p. 112): ‘For many years I believed that you had once been\r\nmine, and I had lost you again. Now I know that you never were mine;\r\nbut I shall win you.’ Dina (_The Pillars of Society_) cannot leave\r\nbecause she is not yet married, but as becomes her state of maidenhood,\r\nshe gives her rebellious thoughts this form (p. 93): ‘I will be\r\nyour wife; but first I will work, and become something for myself,\r\njust as you are. I will give myself; I will not be taken.’ Rebecca\r\n(_Rosmersholm_) is also unmarried, yet she runs away (p. 96):\r\n\r\n I am going.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. Where are you going, Rebecca?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. North, by the steamer. It was there I came from.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. But you have no ties there now.\r\n\r\n REBECCA. I have none here either.\r\n\r\n ROSMER. What do you think of doing?\r\n\r\n REBECCA. I don’t know. I only want to have done with it all.\r\n\r\nNow for the antithesis, the hypocritical egoist who satisfies his\r\nego-mania without giving offence to society. This personage presents\r\nhimself under the names successively of Torvald Helmer, Consul\r\nBernick, Curate Rörlund, Rector Kroll, Pastor Manders, Burgomaster\r\nStockmann, Werle, and once, to a certain extent, Hedda Gabler,\r\nalways with the same ideas and the same words. In _A Doll’s House_\r\n(p. 104, _et seq._), after his wife’s confession, Helmer cries:\r\n‘Oh, what an awful awakening!... No religion, no morality, no sense\r\nof duty.... He can publish the whole story; and if he does publish\r\nit, perhaps I should be suspected of having been a party to your\r\ncriminal transactions.... I must try to pacify him in one way or the\r\nother. The story must be kept secret, cost what it may.’ In _Ghosts_\r\nPastor Manders on different occasions expresses himself thus: ‘One is\r\ncertainly not bound to account to everybody for what one reads and\r\nthinks within one’s own four walls.... We must not expose ourselves to\r\nfalse interpretations, and we have no right whatever to give offence to\r\nour neighbours.... You go and risk your good name and reputation, and\r\nnearly succeed in ruining other people’s reputation into the bargain.\r\nIt was unspeakably reckless of you to seek refuge with me.... Yes, that\r\nis the only thing possible’ (to ‘hush the matter up’) ‘... yes, family\r\nlife is certainly not always so pure as it ought to be. But in such\r\na case as you point to’ (an incestuous union), ‘one can never know.’\r\nRörlund (_The Pillars of Society_): ‘See how the family is undermined\r\nover there! how a brazen spirit of destruction is attacking the most\r\nvital truths!... Of course, a tare now and then springs up among the\r\nwheat, alas! but we honestly do our best to weed it out.... Oh, Dina,\r\nyou can form no conception of the thousand considerations! When a man\r\nis placed as a moral pillar of the society he lives in, why--he cannot\r\nbe too careful.... Oh, Dina, you are so dear to me! Hush! someone is\r\ncoming. Dina, for my sake, go out to the others.... A good book forms\r\na refreshing contrast to what we unhappily see every day in newspapers\r\nand magazines.’ Consul Bernick, in the same piece: ‘Just at this time,\r\nwhen I depend so much on unmixed good feeling, both in the press and\r\nin the town. There will be paragraphs in the papers all over the\r\ncountry-side.... These newspaper scribblers are always covertly carping\r\nat us.... I whose mission it is to be an example to my fellow-citizens,\r\nmust have such things thrown in my teeth! I cannot bear it. It won’t\r\ndo for me to have my name bespattered in this way.... I must keep\r\nmy conscience unspotted. Besides, it will make a good impression\r\non both the press and the public at large when they see that I set\r\naside all personal considerations, and let justice take its course.’\r\nKroll, in _Rosmersholm_: ‘Do you ever see the Radical papers?... But\r\nyou’ve seen, then, I suppose, how these gentlemen of “the people” have\r\nbeen pleased to treat me? what infamous abuse they’ve dared to heap\r\nupon me?’ Werle, in _The Wild Duck_: ‘Even if, out of attachment to\r\nme, she were to disregard gossip and scandal and all that----?’ The\r\nBurgomaster, in _An Enemy of the People_: ‘If, perhaps, I do watch over\r\nmy reputation with some anxiety, I do it for the good of the town....\r\nYour statement ... must be kept back for the good of all ... we will\r\ndo the best we can quietly; but nothing whatever, not a single word,\r\nof this unfortunate business must be made public.... And then you have\r\nan unhappy propensity for rushing into print upon every possible and\r\nimpossible matter. You no sooner hit upon an idea than you must write\r\nat once some newspaper article or a whole pamphlet about it.’ Finally,\r\nHedda Gabler: ‘And so you went off perfectly openly?... But what do you\r\nsuppose that people will say about you, then?... I so dread a scandal!\r\nYou should accept for your own sake, or, better still, for the world’s\r\nsake.’\r\n\r\nIf all the Nora-like and all the Helmer-like utterances are read\r\nsuccessively, an impression must be formed that they are part of\r\nthe same _rôle_; and this impression is correct, for under all the\r\ndifferent names there is only one _rôle_. The same is true of the\r\nwomen who, in contrast to the ego-maniac Nora, unselfishly sacrifice\r\nthemselves. Martha Bernick, Miss Hessel, Hedwig, Miss Tesman, etc., are\r\nalways the same figure in different guises. The monotony, moreover,\r\nextends to minutest details. Rank’s inherited disease is in Oswald’s\r\ncase only carried further. Nora’s flight is repeated in almost every\r\npiece, and in _The Wild Duck_ is travestied in Hjalmar’s departure from\r\nhis house. One feature of this scene appears word for word in all the\r\n_réchauffés_ of it:\r\n\r\n NORA. Here I lay the keys down. The maids know how to manage\r\n everything in the house far better than I do.\r\n\r\n ELLIDA. If I do go ... I haven’t a key to give up, an order to\r\n give.... I am absolutely rootless in your house, etc.\r\n\r\nIn _A Doll’s House_, the heroine, who has settled her account with\r\nlife and is filled with dread of the impending catastrophe, makes Rank\r\nplay a wild tarantella on the piano, while she dances to it. In _Hedda\r\nGabler_, the heroine is heard ‘suddenly playing a wild dance’ before\r\nshe shoots herself. Rosmer says to Rebecca, when the latter makes known\r\nher wish to die: ‘No; you recoil. You have not the heart to do what\r\n_she_ dared.’ The extortioner Krogstad says to Nora, who threatens to\r\ncommit suicide: ‘Oh, you don’t frighten me! An elegant spoilt lady like\r\nyou.... People don’t do things of that sort.’ Brack says, in response\r\nto Hedda Gabler’s outburst: ‘Rather die! That’s what people say, but\r\nnobody does it!’ In much the same words Helmer reproaches his wife\r\nNora with having sacrificed her honour by the forgery, and Pastor\r\nManders upbraids Mrs. Alving for wishing to sacrifice her honour to\r\nhim. Lona Hessel demands confession from Consul Bernick, and Rebecca\r\nfrom Rosmer, in the same terms. Werle’s crime was the seduction of\r\nthe maidservant Gina. Alving’s crime was the seduction of his own\r\nmaidservant. This pitiable and imbecile self-repetition in Ibsen, this\r\nimpotence of his indolent brain to wash out the imprint of an idea\r\nonce painfully elaborated, goes so far that, even in the invention of\r\nnames for his characters, he is, consciously or unconsciously, under\r\nthe influence of a reminiscence. In _A Doll’s House_ we have Helmer;\r\nin _The Wild Duck_, Hjalmar; in _The Pillars of Society_, Hilmar, Mrs.\r\nBernick’s brother.\r\n\r\nThus Ibsen’s drama is like a kaleidoscope in a sixpenny bazaar. When\r\none looks through the peep-hole, one sees, at each shaking of the\r\ncardboard tube, new and parti-coloured combinations. Children are\r\namused at this toy. But adults know that it contains only splinters\r\nof coloured glass, always the same, inserted haphazard, and united\r\ninto symmetrical figures by three bits of looking-glass, and they\r\nsoon tire of the expressionless arabesques. My simile applies not\r\nonly to Ibsen’s plays, but to the author himself. In reality, he is\r\nthe kaleidoscope. The few paltry bits of glass which for thirty years\r\nhe has rattled and thrown into cheap mosaic patterns, these are his\r\nobsessions. These have existed in his own diseased mind, and have not\r\nsprung from observation of the world’s drama. The pretended ‘realist’\r\nknows nothing of real life. He does not comprehend it; he does not even\r\nsee it, and cannot, therefore, renew from it his store of impressions,\r\nideas, and judgments. The well-known method of manufacturing cannon\r\nis to take a tube and pour molten metal round it. Ibsen proceeds in\r\na similar way with his poems. He has a thesis--more accurately, some\r\nanarchistic folly; this is the tube. It is now only a question of\r\nenveloping this tube with the metal of life’s realities. But that\r\nlies beyond Ibsen’s power. At best he occasionally finds some bits of\r\nworn-down horseshoe-nails, or castaway sardine-box, by rummaging among\r\ndust-heaps; but this small quantity of metal does not suffice for a\r\ncannon. Where Ibsen makes strenuous efforts to produce a picture of\r\nactual contemporaneous events, he astounds us with the niggardliness in\r\nincidents and human beings evinced by the range of his experience.\r\n\r\nPhilistine, ultra-provincial, these are no fit words for this. It sinks\r\nbelow the level of the human. The naturalist Huber and Sir John Lubbock\r\nhave recorded incidents of this sort in their observations of colonies\r\nof ants. The small features pinned by Ibsen to his two-legged theses,\r\nto give them, at least, as much resemblance to humanity as is possessed\r\nby a scarecrow, are borrowed from the society of a hideous hole on the\r\nNorwegian coast, composed of drunkards and silly louts, of idiots and\r\ncrazed hysterical geese, who in their whole life have never formed a\r\nclearer thought than: ‘How can I get hold of a bottle of brandy?’ or\r\n‘How can I make myself interesting to men?’ The sole characteristic\r\ndistinguishing these Lövborgs, Ekdals, Oswald Alvings, etc., from\r\nbeasts is that they are given to drink. The Noras, Heddas, Ellidas,\r\ndo not tipple, but make up for that by raving so wildly as to require\r\nstrait-jackets. The great events of their lives are the obtaining of\r\na position in a bank (_A Doll’s House_); their catastrophes, that one\r\nno longer believes in the articles of their creed (_Rosmersholm_);\r\nthe loss of an appointment as physician at a watering-place (_An\r\nEnemy of the People_); the raked-up rumours of an amorous nocturnal\r\n_péché de jeunesse_ (_The Pillars of Society_); the frightful crimes\r\ndarkening, like a thunder-cloud, the lives of these beings and their\r\nsocial circle are an intrigue with a maidservant (_Ghosts_, _The Wild\r\nDuck_); a _liaison_ with an itinerant music-hall singer (_An Enemy of\r\nthe People_); the felling, by mistake, of wood in a state-forest (_The\r\nWild Duck_); the visit to a house of ill-fame after a good dinner\r\n(_Hedda Gabler_). It sometimes happens to me to pass a half-hour in\r\nthe nursery, amusing myself with the chatter and play of the little\r\nones. One day the children by accident saw the arrest of someone in the\r\nstreet. Although their attendant hurried them away from the unpleasant\r\nspectacle, they had seen enough of the tumult to be violently excited\r\nby it. Some days afterwards on entering the nursery I found them full\r\nof the great event, and I became the auditor of the following dialogue:\r\n\r\n MATILDA (_aged three years_). Why did they put the gentleman in prison?\r\n\r\n RICHARD (_five years old, very dignified and sententious_). It wasn’t\r\n a gentleman; it was a bad man. They put him in prison because he was\r\n wicked.\r\n\r\n MATILDA. What had he done then?\r\n\r\n RICHARD (_after reflecting a little_). His mamma had said he wasn’t to\r\n take chocolate; but he did take chocolate. That’s why his mamma had\r\n him put in prison.\r\n\r\nThis childish conversation always came into my mind when I lighted,\r\nin Ibsen’s plays, upon one of his crimes treated with such overawing\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nWe have now made the complete tour of Ibsen. At the risk of being\r\nprolix and tedious, I have made copious quotations from his writings,\r\nin order that the reader might himself see the matter from which I\r\nhave formed my judgments. Ibsen stands before us as a mystic and an\r\nego-maniac, who would willingly prove the world and mankind not worth\r\npowder and shot, but who only proves that he has not the faintest\r\ninkling of one or the other. Incapable of adapting himself to any state\r\nof things whatsoever, he first abuses the state of things in Norway,\r\nthen that of Europe generally. In no one of his productions is a single\r\nthought to be met with belonging to, or having an active influence\r\non, the present age, unless we bestow this honour on his anarchism,\r\nwhich is explained by the diseased constitution of his mind, and his\r\ntravesties of the least certain results of investigations in hypnotism\r\nand telepathy. He is a skilful dramatic technician, and knows how to\r\nrepresent with great poetic power personages in the background, and\r\nsituations out of the chief current of the piece. This, however, is\r\nall that a conscientious and lucid analysis can really find in him.\r\nHe has dared to speak of his ‘moral ideas,’ and his admirers glibly\r\nrepeat the expression. Ibsen’s moral ideas! Any reader of the Ibsen\r\ndrama, who finds in _them_ no food for laughter, has truly no sense\r\nof humour. He seems to preach apostacy, yet cannot free himself from\r\nthe religious ideas of confession, original sin, and the Saviour’s act\r\nof redemption. He sets up egoism and the freedom of the individual\r\nfrom all scruples as an ideal, yet hardly has anyone acted somewhat\r\nunscrupulously, but he begins to whimper contritely, and continues\r\nuntil his heart, full to suffocation, has poured itself out in\r\nconfession; while the only persons with whom he succeeds are women,\r\nwho sacrifice their individuality to the point of annihilation for the\r\nsake of others. He extols every offence against morality as heroism,\r\nwhile he punishes, with nothing less than death, the smallest and\r\nstupidest love affair. He uses the words freedom, progress, etc., as\r\na gargle, and in his best works honours lying and stagnation. And all\r\nthese contradictions appear forsooth not successively as stations on\r\nthe road of his development, but at one and the same time, and side by\r\nside. His French admirer, Ehrhard,[358] sees this disconcerting fact,\r\nand endeavours as best he can to excuse it. His Norwegian interpreter,\r\nHenrik Jaeger, on the contrary, asserts with the utmost placidity[359]\r\nthat the most prominent characteristic of Ibsen’s works is their\r\nunity (_Enhed_). The Frenchman and the Norwegian were most incautious\r\nin not preconcerting, prior to praising their great man in manners\r\nso divergent. The single discoverable unity in Ibsen is his faculty\r\nof distortion. The point in which he always resembles himself is his\r\nentire incapacity to elaborate a single clear thought, to comprehend a\r\nsingle one of the watchwords daubed here and there on to his works, or\r\nto deduce the true conclusions from a single one of his premises.\r\n\r\nAnd this malignant, anti-social simpleton, highly gifted, it must be\r\nadmitted, in the technique of the stage, they have had the audacity to\r\ntry to raise upon the shield as the great world-poet of the closing\r\ncentury. His partizans have continued to shout, ‘Ibsen is a great\r\npoet!’ until all stronger judgments have become at least hesitating,\r\nand feebler ones wholly subjugated. In a recent book on Simon\r\nMagus,[360] there occurs this pretty story: ‘Apsethus, the Libyan,\r\nwished to become a god. In spite, however, of his most strenuous\r\nefforts he could not succeed in satisfying his longing. But, at any\r\nrate, he would make the people believe that he had become a god. He\r\ntherefore collected a large number of parrots, in which Libya abounds,\r\nand shut them all in a cage. He kept them so for some time, and\r\ntaught them to say, “Apsethus is a god.” When the birds had learnt\r\nthis, he opened the cage and set them free. And the birds spread\r\nthemselves throughout Libya, so that the words penetrated to the Greek\r\nsettlements. And the Libyans, astonished at the voice of the birds,\r\nand not suspecting the trick Apsethus had played, looked upon him as a\r\ngod.’ In imitation of the ingenious Apsethus, Ibsen has taught a few\r\n‘comprehensives’--the Brandes, Ehrhards, Jaegers, etc.--the words:\r\n‘Ibsen is a modern! Ibsen is a poet of the future!’ and the parrots\r\nhave spread over all the lands, and are chattering with deafening din\r\nin books and papers, ‘Ibsen is great! Ibsen is a modern spirit!’ and\r\nimbeciles among the public murmur the cry after them, because they\r\nhear it frequently repeated, and because, on such as they, every word\r\nuttered with emphasis and assurance makes an impression.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be a proof of superficiality to believe that the\r\naudacity of his Corybantes alone explains the high place to which\r\nIbsen has been fraudulently elevated. Without question he possesses\r\ncharacteristics by which he could not but act upon his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we have his vague phrases and indefinite incidental hints\r\nconcerning ‘the great epoch in which we live,’ ‘the new era about\r\nto dawn,’ ‘freedom,’ ‘progress,’ etc. These phrases were bound to\r\nplease all dreamers and drivellers, for they give free scope to any\r\ninterpretation, and, in particular, allow the presumption that their\r\nauthor is possessed of modernity and a bold spirit of progress. They\r\nare not discouraged by the fact that Ibsen himself makes cruel sport\r\nof these ‘comprehensives,’ when, in _The Wild Duck_, he makes Relling\r\n(p. 361) use the word ‘demoniac,’ while admitting it to be wholly\r\nmeaningless, just as the poet himself employs his own bunkum about\r\nprogress and freedom. They are ‘comprehensives’ precisely because they\r\ninterpret every passage according to their own sweet will.\r\n\r\nThen there is Ibsen’s doctrine of the right of the individual to live\r\nin accordance with his own law. Is this really his doctrine? This must\r\nbe denied when, after struggling through his countless contradictions\r\nand self-refutations, we see that he treats with peculiar affection\r\nthe sacrificial lambs, who are all negation of their own ‘I,’ all\r\nsuppression of their most natural impulses, all neighbourly love and\r\nconsideration for others. In any case, his apostles have brought\r\nforward anarchistic individualism as the central doctrine of his drama.\r\nEhrhard[361] sums up this doctrine in these words: ‘The revolt of the\r\nindividual against society. In other words, Ibsen is the apostle of\r\nmoral autonomy (_autonomie morale_).’ Now such a doctrine is surely\r\nwell fitted to cause ravages among the intellectually indolent or\r\nintellectually incapable.\r\n\r\nEhrhard dares to use the expression ‘moral autonomy.’ In the name of\r\nthis fine principle Ibsen’s critical heralds persuade the youth who\r\ngather round him that they have the right to ‘live out their lives,’\r\nand they smile approvingly when their auditors understand by this term\r\nthe right to yield to their basest instincts and to free themselves\r\nfrom all discipline. As the scoundrels in Mediterranean ports do with\r\nwell-dressed travellers, they whisper in the ear of their public,\r\n‘Amuse yourselves! Enjoy yourselves! Come with me; I will show you the\r\nway!’ But to confound ‘moral autonomy’ with absence of restraint is, on\r\nthe part of their faith, a monstrous error, and in the corrupters of\r\nyouth, hoping for the pay of procuration, an infamous deception.\r\n\r\nThese two notions are not only not synonymous, they are diametrically\r\nopposed and mutually exclusive. Liberty of the individual! The right to\r\nautonomy! The Ego its own legislator! Who is this ‘I’ that is to make\r\nlaws for itself? Who is this ‘Self’ for whom Ibsen demands the right\r\nof autonomy? Who is this free individual? That the entire notion of a\r\nSelf opposed to the rest of the world as something alien and exclusive\r\nis an illusion of consciousness, we have already seen in the chapter\r\non the ‘Psychology of Ego-mania,’ and I need not, therefore, dwell\r\nagain on the subject in this place. We know that man, like every other\r\ncomplex and highly developed living being, is a society or state, of\r\nsimpler, and of simplest, living beings, of cells and cell-systems,\r\nor organs, all having their own functions and wants. In the course of\r\nthe development of life on earth they have become associated, and have\r\nundergone changes, in order to be able to perform higher functions than\r\nare possible to the simple cell and primitive agglomeration of cells.\r\nThe highest function of life yet known to us is clear consciousness;\r\nthe most elevated content of consciousness is knowledge; and the most\r\nobvious and immediate aim of knowledge is constantly to procure better\r\nconditions of life for the organism, hence to preserve its existence\r\nas long as possible, and to fill it with the greatest possible number\r\nof pleasurable sensations. In order that the collective organism may\r\nbe able to perform its task, its constituent parts are bound to submit\r\nto a severe hierarchical order. Anarchy in its interior is disease,\r\nand leads rapidly to death. The single cell executes its chemical work\r\nof decomposition and of integration without troubling itself about\r\naught else. It labours almost for itself alone. Its consciousness is\r\nthe most limited conceivable; it has hardly any prevision; its own\r\npower of adaptation is so minute that if a cell is in the smallest\r\ndegree less well nourished than its neighbour, it cannot hold its\r\nground against the latter, and is immediately devoured by it.[362]\r\nThe differentiated cell-group, or organ, already possesses a wider\r\nconsciousness, whose seat is its own nerve-ganglia; its function is\r\nmore complex, and no longer operates wholly, or even chiefly, for its\r\nown benefit, but for that of the collective organism; it also has\r\nalready, I might say, a constitutional influence on the direction of\r\nthe affairs of the whole organism, asserting itself in the power of\r\nthe organ to suggest to consciousness presentations prompting the will\r\nto acts. The most exalted organ, however, the condensation of all the\r\nother organs, is the gray cerebral cortex. It is the seat of clear\r\nconsciousness. It works least of all for itself, most of all for the\r\ncommonwealth--_i.e._, for the whole organism. It is the government of\r\nthe State. To it come all reports from the interior as well as the\r\nexterior; it has to find its way in the midst of all complications;\r\nit has to exercise foresight, and to take into consideration not only\r\nthe immediate effect of an act, but also the more remote consequences\r\nfor the commonwealth. When, therefore, it is a question of the ‘I,’\r\nthe ‘Self,’ the ‘Individual,’ it cannot be any subordinate part of the\r\norganism which is meant, such as the little toe or the rectum, but\r\nonly the gray cerebral cortex. To it certainly belongs the right and\r\nduty of directing the individual and of prescribing its law. It is\r\nconsciousness itself. But how does consciousness form its judgments and\r\nits decisions? It forms them from representations awakened in it by\r\nexcitations proceeding from the internal organs and from the senses.\r\nIf consciousness allows itself to be directed solely by the organic\r\nexcitations, it seeks to gratify its momentary appetites, on the spot,\r\nat the cost of well-being, it injures an organ by favouring the need\r\nof another, and it neglects to take into consideration circumstances\r\nof the external world which must be dealt with in the interest of\r\nthe whole organism. Let me give some quite simple illustrations. A\r\nman is swimming under water. His cells know nothing of it, and do\r\nnot trouble themselves about it. They quietly absorb from the blood\r\nthe oxygen which they need at the moment, and set free, in exchange,\r\ncarbonic dioxide. The decomposed blood excites the medulla oblongata,\r\nand the latter impetuously demands a movement of inspiration. Were\r\nthe gray cerebral cortex to yield to the perfectly justifiable demand\r\nof one organ, and allow an impulse to inspire to proceed to the\r\nmuscles concerned, the consequence would be the filling of the lungs\r\nwith water, and death of the entire organism in consequence. Hence\r\nconsciousness does not obey the demand of the medulla oblongata, and,\r\ninstead of sending motor impulses to the intercostal muscles and\r\nthose of the diaphragm, communicates them to the muscles of the arms\r\nand legs; instead of breathing under water, the swimmer emerges at\r\nthe surface. Another instance. A typhoid convalescent feels ragingly\r\nhungry. Were he to yield to this desire, he might give himself a\r\nmomentary satisfaction, but twenty-four hours later he would probably\r\ndie from perforation of the intestines. Hence his consciousness resists\r\nthe desire of his organs for the benefit of the whole organism. The\r\ncases are, of course, generally much more complex. But it is always the\r\ntask of consciousness to test the stimuli which it receives from the\r\ndepths of the organs, to comprise in the motor images which they excite\r\nall its earlier experiences, its knowledge, the directions given by the\r\nexternal world, and to disregard the stimuli if the judgments opposed\r\nto them are more powerful than they.\r\n\r\nEven a perfectly healthy organism quickly goes to rack and ruin if the\r\ninhibitive activity of consciousness is not exercised, and if, through\r\nthis want of exercise, its inhibitive strength becomes atrophied.\r\nCæsarian madness[363] is nothing but the consequence of the systematic\r\nindulgence by consciousness of every demand of the organs. If, however,\r\nthe organism is not perfectly healthy; if it is degenerate, its ruin is\r\nmuch more speedy and certain when it obeys the urging of its organs,\r\nfor in such a case these organs are suffering from perversions; they\r\nexact satisfactions, not only pernicious in their remote consequences\r\nto the whole organism, but immediately so to the organs themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the ‘I’ is spoken of, which is to have the right\r\nto dispose of itself, only the conscious ‘Ego’ can be meant, the\r\npondering, remembering, observing, comparing intellect, not, however,\r\nthe sub-’Egos’--unconnected, and for the most part at strife with each\r\nother--which are included in subconsciousness.[364] The individual\r\nis the judging, not the instinctive, human being. Liberty is the\r\ncapacity of consciousness to derive excitations, not only from\r\nthe stimuli of the organs, but from those of the senses, and from\r\noriginal memory-images. Ibsen’s liberty is the most abject, and always\r\nsuicidal,[365] slavery. It is the subjugation of judgment to instinct,\r\nand the revolt of some single organ against the domination of that\r\npower, which has to watch over the well-being of the whole organism.\r\nEven so individualistic a philosopher as Herbert Spencer[366] says: ‘To\r\nbecome fitted for the social state, it is necessary that the man ...\r\nshould possess the energy capable of renouncing a small enjoyment of\r\nthe moment, in order to obtain a greater one in the future.’ A healthy\r\nman in the full vigour of intellect cannot sacrifice his judgment. The\r\n_sacrifizio dell’ intelletto_ is the only one he cannot afford. If law\r\nand custom impose upon him acts which he recognises as absurd because\r\nthey defeat their end, not only will he have the right, but it will\r\nbe his duty, to defend reason against nonsense, and knowledge against\r\nerror. But his revolt will always be in the name of judgment, not in\r\nthe name of instinct.\r\n\r\nAll this philosophy of self-restraint can, it is true, be preached to\r\nhealthy human beings only. It has no application to degenerates. Their\r\ndefective brain and nervous system are not in a state to respond to its\r\ndemands. The processes within their organs are morbidly intensified.\r\nHence the latter send particularly powerful stimuli to consciousness.\r\nThe sensory nerves conduct badly. The memory-images in the brain are\r\nfaint. Perceptions of the external world, representations of anterior\r\nexperiences, are, therefore, non-existent or too feeble to subdue the\r\nstimulus originating in the organs. Such persons can do nought else\r\nbut follow their desires and impulsions. They are the ‘instinctivists’\r\nand ‘impulsivists’ of mental therapeutics. To this species belong the\r\nNoras, Ellidas, Rebeccas, Stockmanns, Brands, etc. This company, being\r\ndangerous to themselves and to others, require to be put under the\r\nguardianship of rational men, or, better still, in lunatic asylums.\r\nSuch must be the answer to those fools or charlatans who vaunt\r\nIbsen’s figures as ‘free men’ and ‘strong personalities,’ and with\r\nthe sweet-sounding tones of a Pied Piper’s air on ‘self-disposal,’\r\n‘moral independence,’ and ‘living life out,’ attract children devoid of\r\njudgment heaven knows whither, but in any case to their ruin.\r\n\r\nThe third feature of Ibsen’s drama accounting for his success is the\r\nlight in which he shows woman. ‘Women are the pillars of society,’ he\r\nmakes Bernick say (in _The Pillars of Society_, p. 114). With Ibsen\r\nwoman has no duties and all rights. The tie of marriage does not bind\r\nher. She runs away when she longs for liberty, or when she believes she\r\nhas cause of complaint against her husband, or when he pleases her a\r\nlittle less than another man. The man who plays the Joseph, and does\r\nnot comply with the will of Madame Potiphar, does not draw on himself\r\nthe customary ridicule; he is roundly pronounced a criminal (_Ghosts_,\r\np. 158):\r\n\r\n PASTOR MANDERS. It was my greatest victory, Helen--the victory over\r\n myself.\r\n\r\n MRS. ALVING. It was a crime against us both.\r\n\r\nWoman is always the clever, strong, courageous being; man always the\r\nsimpleton and coward. In every encounter the wife is victorious,\r\nand the man flattened out like a pancake. Woman need live for\r\nherself alone. With Ibsen she has even overcome her most primitive\r\ninstinct--that of motherhood--and abandons her brood without\r\ntwitching an eyelid when the caprice seizes her to seek satisfactions\r\nelsewhere. Such abject adoration of woman--a pendant to Wagner’s\r\nwoman-idolatry--such unqualified approval of all feminine depravities,\r\nwas bound to secure the applause of those women who in the viragoes\r\nof Ibsen’s drama--hysterical, nymphomaniacal, perverted in maternal\r\ninstinct[367]--recognise either their own portrait or the ideal of\r\ndevelopment of their degenerate imagination. Women of this species\r\nfind, as a matter of fact, all discipline intolerable. They are by\r\nbirth _les femmes de ruisseau_ of Dumas fils. They are not fit for\r\nmarriage--for European marriage with one man only. Promiscuous sexual\r\nintercourse and prostitution are their most deeply-seated instincts,\r\naccording to Ferrero[368] the atavistic form of degeneration in women,\r\nand they are grateful to Ibsen for having catalogued, under the fine\r\ndesignations of ‘The struggle of woman for moral independence’ and ‘The\r\nright of woman to assert her own personality,’ those propensities to\r\nwhich opprobrious names are usually given.\r\n\r\nIn his fiercely travestied exaggerations of Ibsen’s doctrines, entitled\r\n_Der Vater_, _Gräfin Julie_, _Gläubiger_, etc., poor Grindberg, whose\r\nbrain is equally deranged, but who possesses great creative power, goes\r\nto the greatest pains to show the absurdity of Ibsen’s notions on the\r\nnature of woman, her rights, her relations to man. His method, however,\r\nis a false one. He will never convince Ibsen by rational arguments that\r\nhis doctrines are foolish, for they do not spring from his reason,\r\nbut from his unconscious instincts. His figures of women and their\r\ndestinies are the poetical expression of that sexual perversion of\r\ndegenerates called by Krafft-Ebing ‘masochism.’[369] Masochism is a\r\nsub-species of ‘contrary sexual sensation.’ The man affected by this\r\nperversion feels himself, as regards woman, to be the weaker party; as\r\nthe one standing in need of protection; as the slave who rolls on the\r\nground, compelled to obey the behests of his mistress, and finding his\r\nhappiness in obedience. It is the inversion of the healthy and natural\r\nrelation between the sexes. In Sacher-Masoch imperious and triumphant\r\nwoman wields the knout; in Ibsen she exacts confessions, inflicts\r\ninflammatory reprimands, and leaves in a flare of Bengal lights. In\r\nessence, Ibsen’s heroines are the same as Sacher-Masoch’s, though the\r\nexpression of feminine superiority is a little less brutal. It is\r\nremarkable that the women who exult over Ibsen’s Nora-types are not\r\nshocked by the Hedwigs, Miss Tesmans, and other womanly embodiments\r\nof sacrifice, in whom the highly contradictory thoughts and feelings\r\nof the confused mystic come to light. But it has been psychologically\r\nestablished that human beings overlook what is in dissonance with their\r\nown propinquities, and dwell on that only which is in harmony with them.\r\n\r\nIbsen’s feminine clientèle is, moreover, not composed merely of\r\nhysterical and degenerate characters, but includes also those women\r\nwho are leading an unhappy married life, or believe themselves\r\nmisunderstood, or suffer from the discontent and inner void resulting\r\nfrom insufficient occupation. Clear thinking is not the most prominent\r\nquality of this species of woman. Otherwise they would not have found\r\ntheir advocate in Ibsen. Ibsen is not their friend. No one is who, as\r\nlong as the present order of society exists, attacks the institution of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nA serious and healthy reformer will contend for the principle that\r\nmarriage should acquire a moral and emotional import, and not remain\r\na lying form. He will condemn the marriage for interest, a dowry or\r\nbusiness marriage; he will brand as a crime the action of married\r\ncouples who feel for some other human being a strong, true love,\r\ntested by time and struggle, and yet remain together in a cowardly\r\npseudo-union, deceiving and contaminating each other, instead of\r\nhonourably separating and contracting genuine connections elsewhere;\r\nhe will demand that marriage be based on reciprocal inclination,\r\nmaintained by confidence, respect, and gratitude, consolidated by\r\nconsideration for the offspring; but he will guard himself from saying\r\nanything against marriage itself, this bulwark of the relations\r\nbetween the sexes afforded by definite, permanent duty. Marriage is a\r\nhigh advance from the free copulation of savages. To abandon it and\r\nreturn to primitive promiscuity would be the most profound atavism of\r\ndegeneracy. Marriage, moreover, was not instituted for the man, but\r\nfor the woman and the child. It is a protective social institution for\r\nthe benefit of the weaker part. Man has not yet conquered and humanized\r\nhis polygamous animal instincts to the same extent as woman. It would\r\nfor the most part be quite agreeable to him to exchange the woman he\r\npossesses for a new one. Departures à la Nora are as a rule not of a\r\nnature to frighten him. He could open the door very wide for Nora,\r\nand bestow on her his parting benediction with much pleasure. Were it\r\nonce the law and custom in a society where each was forced to care for\r\nhimself alone (and needed only to trouble himself about the offspring\r\nof others, when it was a question of orphan, abandoned, or begging\r\nchildren) that man and wife should separate as soon as they ceased\r\nto be agreeable to each other, it would be the men and not the women\r\nwho would first make use of the new liberty. Departures à la Nora are\r\nperhaps without danger for rich wives, or those eminently capable of\r\nacquiring means of support, and hence pecuniarily independent. Such,\r\nhowever, in present society constitute a minute minority. Under Ibsen’s\r\ncode of morals the vast majority of wives would have everything to\r\nlose. The severe discipline of matrimony is their bulwark. It obliges\r\nthe man to take care of the children and of the wife as she declines in\r\nyears. Hence it should be the true duty of rational wives to declare\r\nIbsen infamous, and to revolt against Ibsenism, which criminally\r\nthreatens them and their rights. Only through error can women of spirit\r\nand indisputable morality join the ranks of Ibsen’s followers. It is\r\nnecessary to enlighten them concerning the range of his doctrines, and\r\nin particular concerning their effect on the position of woman, so that\r\nthey may abandon a company which can never be their own. May he remain\r\nsurrounded by those only who are spirit of his spirit, that is to say,\r\nby hysterical women and masculine masochists, who, with Ehrhard,[370]\r\nbelieve that ‘sound common-sense and optimism are the two destructive\r\nprinciples of all poetry’!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS in Ibsen ego-mania has found its poet, so in Nietzsche it has found\r\nits philosopher. The deification of filth by the Parnassians with\r\nink, paint, and clay; the censing among the Diabolists and Decadents\r\nof licentiousness, disease, and corruption; the glorification, by\r\nIbsen, of the person who ‘wills,’ is ‘free’ and ‘wholly himself’--of\r\nall this Nietzsche supplies the theory, or something which proclaims\r\nitself as such. We may remark, in passing, that this has ever been\r\nthe task of philosophy. It plays in the race the same _rôle_ as\r\nconsciousness in the individual. Consciousness has the thankless task\r\nof discovering rational and elucidatory grounds for the explanation\r\nof the impulses and acts springing up in subconsciousness. In the\r\nsame way philosophy endeavours to find formulæ of apparent profundity\r\nfor the peculiarities of feeling, thought and deed, having their\r\nroots in the history of politics and civilization--in climatic and\r\neconomic conditions--and to fit them with a sort of uniform of logic.\r\nThe race lives on, conformably with the historical necessity of its\r\nevolution, not troubling itself about a theory of its peculiarities;\r\nand philosophy hobbles busily after it, gathers with more or less\r\nregularity into its album the scattered features of racial character,\r\nand the manifestations of its health and disease; methodically provides\r\nthis album with a title, paging, and full stop, then places it with a\r\ncontented air in the library, among the systems of the same regulation\r\nsize. Genuine truths, real, apposite explanations--these are not\r\ncontained in philosophical systems. But they furnish instructive\r\nevidence of the efforts of the racial consciousness to supply reason,\r\nskilfully or clumsily, with the excuses it demands for the unconscious\r\nimpulses of the race during a given period of time.\r\n\r\nFrom the first to the last page of Nietzsche’s writings the careful\r\nreader seems to hear a madman, with flashing eyes, wild gestures, and\r\nfoaming mouth, spouting forth deafening bombast; and through it all,\r\nnow breaking out into frenzied laughter, now sputtering expressions\r\nof filthy abuse and invective, now skipping about in a giddily agile\r\ndance, and now bursting upon the auditors with threatening mien and\r\nclenched fists. So far as any meaning at all can be extracted from the\r\nendless stream of phrases, it shows, as its fundamental elements, a\r\nseries of constantly reiterated delirious ideas, having their source\r\nin illusions of sense and diseased organic processes, which will be\r\npointed out in the course of this chapter. Here and there emerges a\r\ndistinct idea, which, as is always the case with the insane, assumes\r\nthe form of an imperious assertion, a sort of despotic command.\r\nNietzsche never tries to argue. If the thought of the possibility of\r\nan objection arises in his mind, he treats it lightly, or sneers at\r\nit, or curtly and rudely decrees, ‘That is false!’ (‘How much more\r\nrational is that ... theory, for example, represented by Herbert\r\nSpencer!... According to this theory, good is that which has hitherto\r\nalways proved itself to be useful, so that it may be estimated as\r\nvaluable in the highest degree, as valuable in itself. Although this\r\nmode of explanation is also false, the explanation itself is at least\r\nrational and psychologically tenable.’--_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, 2\r\nAufl., p. 5. ‘This mode of explanation is also false.’ Full-stop! Why\r\nis it false? Wherein is it false? Because Nietzsche so orders it. The\r\nreader has no right to inquire further.) For that matter, he himself\r\ncontradicts almost every one of his violently dictatorial dogmas. He\r\nfirst asserts something and then its opposite, and both with equal\r\nvehemence, most frequently in the same book, often on the same page.\r\nNow and then he becomes conscious of the self-contradiction, and\r\nthen he pretends to have been amusing himself and making sport of\r\nthe reader. (‘It is difficult to be understood, especially when one\r\nthinks and lives gangasrotogati, among plain men who think and live\r\notherwise--in other words, kromagati, or under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, among mandeigati, who “have the frog’s mode of\r\nprogression”--I just do all I can to make myself hard to understand....\r\nBut with regard to the “good friends” ... it is well to accord them in\r\nadvance room for the play and exercise of misconception; in this way\r\none has still something to laugh at--or wholly to abolish these good\r\nfriends--and still laugh!’--_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, 2 Aufl., p.\r\n38. Similarly on p. 51: ‘All that is profound loves the mask; the most\r\nprofound things even hate imagery and parable. Should not _contrast_\r\nrather be the right disguise in which the shamefacedness of a god might\r\nwalk abroad?’)\r\n\r\nThe nature of the individual dogmatic assertions is very\r\ncharacteristic. First of all it is essential to become habituated to\r\nNietzsche’s style. This is, I admit, unnecessary for the alienist.\r\nTo him this sort of style is well known and familiar. He frequently\r\nreads writings (it is true, as a rule, unprinted) of a similar order\r\nof thought and diction, and he reads them, not for his pleasure, but\r\nthat he may prescribe the confinement of the author in an asylum.\r\nThe unprofessional reader, on the contrary, is easily confused by\r\nthe tumult of phrases. Once, however, he has found his way, once he\r\nhas acquired some practice in discerning the actual theme among the\r\ndrums-and-fifes of this ear-splitting, merry-go-round music, and,\r\nin the hailstorm of rattling words, that render clear vision almost\r\nimpossible, has learned to perceive the fundamental thought, he at once\r\nobserves that Nietzsche’s assertions are either commonplaces, tricked\r\nout like Indian caciques with feather-crown, nose-ring, and tattooing\r\n(and of so mean a kind that a high-school girl would be ashamed to make\r\nuse of them in a composition-exercise); or bellowing insanity, rambling\r\nfar beyond the range of rational examination and refutation. I will\r\ngive only one or two examples of each kind among the thousands that\r\nexist:\r\n\r\n_Also sprach Zarathustra_[371] (‘Thus spake Zoroaster’), 3 Theil, p.\r\n9: ‘We halted just by a gateway. “See this gateway, dwarf”--I said\r\nagain--“it has two faces. Two roads meet here; no one has yet travelled\r\nto their end. This long road behind--it lasts an eternity. And that\r\nlong road in front--that is another eternity. They contradict each\r\nother, these roads; they offend each other; and it is here at this\r\ngateway that they meet. The name of the gateway is inscribed above,\r\n“Now.” But if one continues to follow one of them further, and ever\r\nfurther, and ever further, believest thou, dwarf, that these roads\r\neternally contradict each other?”’\r\n\r\nBlow away the lather from these phrases. What do they really say? The\r\nfleeting instant of the present is the point of contact of the past and\r\nthe future. Can one call this self-evident fact a thought?\r\n\r\n_Also sprach Zarathustra_, 4 Theil, p. 124 _ff._: ‘The world is deep,\r\nand deeper than the day thinks it. Forbear! forbear! I am too pure for\r\nthee. Disturb me not! Has my world not become exactly perfect? My flesh\r\nis too pure for thy hands. Forbear, thou dull doltish and obtuse day!\r\nIs not the midnight clearer? The purest are to be lords of earth, the\r\nmost unknown, the strongest, the souls of midnight, who are clearer\r\nand deeper than each day.... My sorrow, my happiness, are deep, thou\r\nstrange day; but yet am I no God, no Hell of God: deep is their woe.\r\nGod’s woe is deeper, thou strange World! Grasp at God’s woe, not at me!\r\nWhat am I! A drunken sweet lyre--a lyre of midnight, a singing frog,\r\nunderstood by none, but who _must_ speak before the deaf, O higher men!\r\nFor ye understand me not! Hence! hence! O youth! O mid-day! O midnight!\r\nNow came evening and night and midnight.... Ah! ah! how it sighs! how\r\nit laughs, how it rattles and gasps, the midnight! How soberly even she\r\nspeaks, this poetess! Without doubt she has overdrunk her drunkenness!\r\nShe became too wide awake! She chews the cud! She chews the cud of her\r\nwoe in dream, the old deep midnight, and still more her joy. For joy,\r\nif woe be already deep: joy is deeper still than heart-pain.... Woe\r\nsays, “Away! get thee gone, woe!... But joy wishes for a second coming,\r\nwishes all to be eternally like itself. Woe says, “Break, bleed, O\r\nheart! Wander, limb! Wing, fly! Onward! Upward! Pain!” Well, then!\r\nCheer up! Oh, my old heart! Woe says, “Away!” Ye higher men ... should\r\nye ever wish for one time twice, should ye ever say, “Thou pleasest me,\r\nhappiness! Quick! instant! then would ye wish _all_ back again! All\r\nanew, all eternally, all enchained, bound, amorous. Oh! then _loved_\r\nye the world; ye eternities love it eternally and always; and to woe\r\nalso speak ye: hence, but return! For all pleasure wishes--eternity.\r\nAll pleasure wishes for the eternity of all things, wishes for honey,\r\nfor the lees, wishes for drunken midnight, tombs, the consolation of\r\nthe tears of tombs, gilded twilight--what does pleasure not wish for!\r\nShe is thirstier, heartier, hungrier, more terrible, more secret than\r\nall woe; she wishes for _herself_, she gnaws into herself, the will of\r\nthe ring struggles in her.... Pleasure wishes for the eternity of all\r\nthings, wishes for deep, deep eternity!’\r\n\r\nAnd the sense of this crazy shower of whirling words? It is that men\r\nwish pain to cease and joy to endure! This the astounding discovery\r\nexpounded by Nietzsche in this demented raving.\r\n\r\nThe following are obviously insane assertions or expressions:\r\n\r\n_Die fröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 59: ‘What is life? Life--it is the\r\nceaseless rejection from itself of something wishing to die. Life--it\r\nis the being cruel and pitiless towards all in us that is weak and old,\r\nand not in us alone.’\r\n\r\nPersons capable of thought have hitherto always believed that life\r\nis the unceasing reception into itself of something agreeable; the\r\nrejection of what is used up is only an accompanying phenomenon of the\r\nreception of new material. Nietzsche’s phrase expresses in a highly\r\nmysterious Pythian form the idea of the matutinal visit to a certain\r\nplace. Healthy men connect with the conception of life the idea rather\r\nof the dining-room than that of the privy.\r\n\r\n_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, p. 92: ‘It is a delicacy that God learned\r\nGreek when He wished to become an author--and that He did not learn it\r\nbetter.’ P. 95: ‘Advice in the form of an enigma. If the cord is not to\r\nsnap ... thou must first bite on it.’\r\n\r\nI have no explanation or interpretation of this profundity to offer.\r\n\r\nThe passages quoted will have given the reader an idea of Nietzsche’s\r\nliterary style. In the dozen volumes, thick or thin, which he has\r\npublished it is always the same. His books bear various titles, for\r\nthe most part characteristically crack-brained, but they all amount\r\nto one single book. They can be changed by mistake in reading, and\r\nthe fact will not be noticed. They are a succession of disconnected\r\nsallies, prose and doggerel mixed, without beginning or ending. Rarely\r\nis a thought developed to any extent; rarely are a few consecutive\r\npages connected by any unity of purpose or logical argument. Nietzsche\r\nevidently had the habit of throwing on paper with feverish haste all\r\nthat passed through his head, and when he had collected a heap of\r\nsnippings he sent them to the printer, and there was a book. These\r\nsweepings of ideas he himself proudly terms ‘aphorisms,’ and the very\r\nincoherence of his language is regarded by his admirers as a special\r\nmerit.[372] When Nietzsche’s moral system is spoken of, it must not\r\nbe imagined that he has anywhere developed one. Through all his\r\nbooks, from the first to the last, there are scattered only views on\r\nmoral problems, and on the relation of man to the species and to the\r\nuniverse, from which, taken together, there may be discerned something\r\nlike a fundamental conception. This is what has been called Nietzsche’s\r\nphilosophy. His disciples, _e.g._, Kaatz, already cited, and, in\r\naddition, Zerbst,[373] Schellwien,[374] and others, have attempted to\r\ngive this pretended philosophy a certain form and unity by fishing out\r\nfrom Nietzsche’s books a number of passages in some measure agreeing\r\nwith each other, and placing them in juxtaposition. It is true that\r\nit would be possible in this way to set up a philosophy of Nietzsche\r\nexactly opposed to the one accepted by his disciples. For, as has been\r\nsaid, each one of Nietzsche’s assertions is contradicted by himself in\r\nsome place or other, and if it be resolved, with barefaced dishonesty,\r\nto pay regard to dicta of a definite kind only, and to pass over those\r\nin opposition to them, it would be possible at pleasure to extract from\r\nNietzsche a philosophical view or its sheer opposite.\r\n\r\nNietzsche’s doctrine, promulgated as orthodox by his disciples,\r\ncriticises the foundations of ethics, investigates the genesis of the\r\nconcept of good and evil, examines the value of that which is called\r\nvirtue and vice, both for the individual and for society, explains\r\nthe origin of conscience, and seeks to give an idea of the end of the\r\nevolution of the race, and, consequently, of man’s ideal--the ‘over\r\nman’ (_Uebermensch_). I desire to condense these doctrines as closely\r\nas possible, and, for the most part, in Nietzsche’s own words, but\r\nwithout the cackle of his mazy digressions or useless phrases.\r\n\r\nThe morality now prevailing ‘gilds, deifies, transports beyond the\r\ntomb, the non-egoistical instincts of compassion, self-denial, and\r\nself-sacrifice.’ But this morality of compassion ‘is humanity’s great\r\ndanger, the beginning of the end, the halting, the backward-glancing\r\nfatigue of the will, turning against life.’ ‘We need a criticism of\r\nmoral values. The value of these values is first of all itself to be\r\nput in question. There has hitherto been no hesitation in setting up\r\ngood as of higher value than evil, of higher value in the sense of\r\nadvancement, utility, prosperity, as regards man in general, including\r\nthe future of man. What if truth lay in the contrary? What if good\r\nwere a symptom of retrogression, a danger, a seduction, a poison, a\r\nnarcotic, by means of which the present should live at the cost of\r\nthe future? Perhaps more comfortably, less dangerously, but also on\r\na smaller scale, more basely? So that precisely morality would be to\r\nblame for the fact that the highest might and splendour possible to\r\nthe human type should never be attained? So that morality should be\r\nprecisely the danger of dangers?’\r\n\r\nNietzsche replies to these questions thrown out by him in the preface\r\nto the book _Zur Genealogie der Moral_, in developing his idea of the\r\ngenesis of present morality.\r\n\r\nHe sees at the beginnings of civilization ‘a beast of prey, a\r\nmagnificent blond brute, ranging about and lusting for booty and\r\nvictory.’ These ‘unchained beasts of prey were free from every\r\nsocial restraint; in the innocence of their wild-beast conscience\r\nthey returned as exultant monsters from a horrible train of murder,\r\nincendiarism, rapine, torture, with an arrogance and composure as if\r\nnothing but a student’s freak had been perpetrated.’ The blond beasts\r\nconstituted the noble races. They fell upon the less noble races,\r\nconquered them, and made slaves of them. ‘A herd of blond beasts of\r\nprey, a race of conquerors and masters, with military organization’\r\n(this word ‘organization’ should be noticed; we shall have to revert to\r\nit), ‘with the power to organize, unscrupulously placing their fearful\r\npaws upon a population perhaps vastly superior in numbers, but still\r\namorphous and wandering--this herd founded the State. The dream is\r\ndispelled which made the State begin with a contract. What has he to do\r\nwith contracts, who can command, who is master by nature, who comes on\r\nthe scene with violence in deed and demeanour?’\r\n\r\nIn the State, then, thus established there were a race of masters\r\nand a race of slaves. The master-race first created moral ideas. It\r\ndistinguished between good and evil. Good was with it synonymous with\r\nnoble; evil with vulgar. All their own qualities they felt as good;\r\nthose of the subject race as evil. Good meant severity, cruelty, pride,\r\ncourage, contempt of danger, joy in risk, extreme unscrupulousness. Bad\r\nmeant ‘the coward, the nervous, the mean, the narrow utilitarian, and\r\nalso the distrustful with his disingenuous glance, the self-abasing,\r\nthe human hound who allows himself to be abused, the begging\r\nflatterer--above all, the liar.’ Such is the morality of the masters.\r\nThe radical meaning of the words now expressing the concept ‘good’\r\nreveals what men represented to themselves as ‘good’ when the moral of\r\nthe masters still held sway. ‘The Latin _bonus_ I believe I may venture\r\nto interpret as “the warrior.” Provided I rightly trace _bonus_ to a\r\nmore ancient _duonus_ (compare _bellum_, _duellum_, _duen-lum_, in\r\nwhich it seems to me that _duonus_ is contained). _Bonus_, then, as a\r\nman of discord, of disunion (_duo_), as warrior: whereby it is seen\r\nwhat in ancient Rome constituted the “goodness” of a man.’\r\n\r\nThe subjugated race had naturally an opposing morality--the morality of\r\nthe slaves. ‘The slave looks with envy on the virtues of the powerful;\r\nhe is sceptical and distrustful; he has the cunning of distrust towards\r\neverything honoured by them as “good.” Conversely, those qualities were\r\ndistinguished and glorified which served to ameliorate the existence\r\nof sufferers. Here the place of honour is given to compassion, to\r\nthe complaisant hand ready to help, to the warm heart, to patience,\r\ndiligence, humility, friendliness, for those are here the most useful\r\nqualities, and almost the only means by which the burden of existence\r\ncan be borne. Slave-morality is essentially utilitarian morality.’\r\n\r\nFor a certain period the morality of masters and slaves subsisted\r\nside by side, or, more accurately, the one above the other. Then\r\nan extraordinary event occurred--slave-morality rebelled against\r\nmaster-morality, conquered and dethroned it, and set itself in the\r\nplace thereof. Then ensued a new valuation of all moral concepts.\r\n(In his insane gibberish Nietzsche names this ‘transvaluation of\r\nvalues’--_Umwerthung der Werthe_.) That which, under the master-morals,\r\nhad passed for good was now esteemed bad, and _vice versâ_. Weakness\r\nwas meritorious, cruelty a crime; self-sacrifice, pity for the pain of\r\nothers, unselfishness, were virtues. That is what Nietzsche terms ‘the\r\nslave revolt in morality.’ ‘The Jews have brought about that marvel\r\nof inversion in values. Their prophets have melted into one substance\r\n“rich,” “godless,” “wicked,” “violent,” “sensual,” and for the first\r\ntime minted the word “world” as one of opprobrium. In this inversion\r\nof values (to which belongs the use of the word “poor” as a synonym of\r\n“holy” and “friend”) lies the importance of the Jewish race.’\r\n\r\nThe Jewish ‘slave-revolt in morality’ was an act of vengeance on the\r\nmaster-race which had long oppressed the Jews, and the instrument of\r\nthis vast vengeance was the Saviour. ‘Has not Israel, by the very\r\nsubterfuge of this “Redeemer,” this seeming adversary and destroyer\r\nof Israel, attained the final goal of its sublime rage for vengeance?\r\nDoes it not belong to the secret black art of a truly _grand_ policy of\r\nvengeance, of a far-seeing, underground, slowly-gripping, foreplanning\r\nvengeance, that Israel itself should deny the proper instrument of\r\nits vengeance before the whole world, as something deadly inimical,\r\nand nail him to the cross, in order that the “entire universe,” viz.,\r\nthe enemies of Israel, might unhesitatingly bite at this very bait?\r\nAnd on the other hand, would it be possible, by all the refinement of\r\nintellect, to imagine a more dangerous bait? Something that should\r\nresemble in enticing, intoxicating, bewildering, corrupting power\r\nthat symbol of the “holy cross,” that awful paradox of a “God on\r\nthe cross,” that mystery of an ineffable final and utmost cruelty,\r\nand self-crucifixion of God for the salvation of man? It is at\r\nleast certain that _sub hoc signo_ Israel, with its vengeance and\r\ntransvaluation of all values, has hitherto triumphed again and again\r\nover all other ideals, over all nobler ideals.’\r\n\r\nTo this passage I would most specially direct the reader’s attention,\r\nand beg him to transform into mental images all that jingle and clatter\r\nof words. Well, then, Israel wished to revenge itself on all the world,\r\nand therefore decided to nail the Saviour to the cross, and thereby\r\ncreate a new morality. Who was this Israel which conceived and executed\r\nthe plan? Was it a parliament, a ministry, a ruler, a popular assembly?\r\nWas the plan, before ‘Israel’ set about realizing it, submitted for\r\ngeneral deliberation and resolution? Before the total insanity of this\r\nstring of words can be distinctly seen, an effort must be made to bring\r\nclearly to the mind, in all its actual details, the event described by\r\nNietzsche as premeditated, intended, and of conscious purpose.\r\n\r\nSince the Jewish slave-revolt in morality, life, till then a delight,\r\nat least for the powerful and bold, or the nobles and masters, has\r\nbecome a torment. Since that revolt the unnatural holds sway, under\r\nwhich man is becoming dwarfed, enfeebled, vulgarized, and gradually\r\ndegenerate. For the fundamental instinct of the healthy man is not\r\nunselfishness and pity, but selfishness and cruelty. ‘No injury,\r\nviolence, exploitation, annihilation, can in itself be a “wrong,”\r\ninasmuch as life operates _essentially_--_i.e._, in its fundamental\r\nfunctions--by injuring, violating, exploiting, annihilating, and is\r\nabsolutely inconceivable without this character. A legal regulation ...\r\nwould be a principle hostile to existence, a destroyer and dissolver of\r\nman, a mark of lassitude, a crime against the future of man, a secret\r\nway to nothingness.’ ‘There is at present universal enthusiasm, even\r\nin scientific disguises, concerning coming conditions of society in\r\nwhich the exploiting character is to disappear. That sounds in my ears\r\nas if someone should promise to invent a life which should abstain\r\nfrom all organic functions. Exploitation does not belong to a decayed,\r\nimperfect, or primitive society: it belongs to the _essence_ of living\r\nthings, as organic function.’[375]\r\n\r\nThus the fundamental instinct of man is cruelty. For this, in the new\r\nslave-morality, there is no place. A fundamental instinct, however,\r\nis not to be uprooted. It still lives and demands its rights. Hence\r\na series of diversions have been sought for it. ‘All instincts, not\r\ndischarged outwardly, turn inwards. Those terrible bulwarks with\r\nwhich political organization protected itself against the ancient\r\ninstincts of freedom--and punishments belong to the front line of\r\nthese bulwarks--had for their result, that all those instincts of\r\nthe savage roaming at large were turned backwards and against man.\r\nAnimosity, cruelty, the joy of pursuit, of sudden assault, of change,\r\nof destruction--all that turns itself against the possessors of such\r\ninstincts is the origin of a “bad conscience.” The man who, from the\r\nabsence of external foes and opposition, forced into the oppressive\r\nconstriction and regularity of custom, impatiently tore himself,\r\npersecuted, gnawed, hunted, maltreated himself--this animal which it\r\nis sought to “tame,” wounding himself against the bars of his cage;\r\nthis destitute creature, consumed with homesickness for the desert, who\r\nhad to create his adventures, his places of torture, his insecure and\r\ndangerous wildernesses, out of his own self--this fool, this yearning,\r\ndespairing prisoner, became the inventor of the evil conscience.’\r\n‘That inclination to self-torture, that retreating cruelty, of the\r\nhuman brute, forced into inner life, scared back into himself, he who\r\nhad invented evil conscience that he might torture himself, after the\r\nnatural outlet of this wish to inflict pain was stopped up,’ formed\r\nalso the concept of guilt and sin. ‘We are the inheritors of the\r\nvivisection of conscience and of animal self-torture of thousands\r\nof years.’ But all administration of justice, the punishment of\r\n‘so-called’ criminals, the greater part of art, especially tragedy, are\r\nalso disguises in which primitive cruelty can still manifest itself.\r\n\r\nSlave-morality, with its ‘ascetic ideal’ of self-suppression and\r\ncontempt of life, and its tormenting invention of conscience, allowed\r\nthe slaves, it is true, to take vengeance on their masters; it also\r\nsubjugated the mighty man-beasts of prey and created better conditions\r\nof existence for the small and weak, for the rabble, the gregarious\r\nanimals; but it has been pernicious to humanity as a whole, because\r\nit has prevented the free evolution of precisely the highest human\r\ntype. ‘The collective degeneration of man to that which, in the eyes\r\nof socialistic ninnies and blockheads of the present day, seems their\r\n“man of the future”--their ideal!--this degeneration and dwarfing of\r\nman to the perfect herd animal (or, as they say, to the man of “free\r\nsociety”), this brutalizing of man to the animal pigmy of equal rights\r\nand pretensions,’ is the destructive work of slave-morality. In order\r\nto discipline humanity to supreme splendour we must revert to nature,\r\nto the morality of the masters, to the unchaining of cruelty. ‘The\r\nwell-being of the most and the well-being of the fewest are contrary\r\nstandpoints of valuation; we will leave it to the simplicity of English\r\nbiologists to hold that the first as such is undoubtedly of the higher\r\nvalue.’ ‘In opposition to the lying watchword of the privilege of the\r\nmajority, in opposition to the desire for abasement, humiliation,\r\nlevelling, for the downward and duskward of man,’ we must sound forth\r\n‘the watchword of the privilege of the minority.’ ‘As a last indicator\r\nof the other way appeared Napoleon, man most unique, and latest born of\r\nall time, and in him the incarnate problem of the aristocratic ideal\r\nas such,--Napoleon, that synthesis of the inhuman and the superhuman\r\n(_Unmensch und Uebermensch_).’\r\n\r\nThe intellectually free man must stand ‘beyond good and evil’; these\r\nconcepts do not exist for him; he tests his impulses and deeds by their\r\nvalue for himself, not by that which they have for others, for the\r\nherd; he does that which causes him pleasure, even when, and especially\r\nwhen, it torments and injures--nay, annihilates others; for him holds\r\ngood the secret rule of life of the ancient Assassins of the Lebanon:\r\n‘Nothing is true, all is permissible.’ With this new morality, humanity\r\nwill finally be able to produce the ‘over-man.’ ‘Thus we find, as\r\nthe ripest fruit on its tree, the sovereign individual, resembling\r\nhimself alone, freed again from the morality of custom, the autonomous\r\nsuper-moral individual (for “autonomous” and “moral” are mutually\r\nexclusive)--in short, the man of his own, independent, long will.’ In\r\n_Zarathustra_ the same thought is expressed dithyrambically: ‘“Man is\r\nwicked,” so spake to me in consolation all the wisest. Ah, if only it\r\nis yet true to-day! For wickedness is man’s best strength. Man must\r\nbecome better and more wicked, so I teach. The greatest wickedness\r\nis necessary to the best of the over-man. It might be good for that\r\npreacher of little people that he suffered and bore the sins of man.\r\nBut I rejoice in great sins as my great consolation.’\r\n\r\nThis is Nietzsche’s moral philosophy which (disregarding\r\ncontradictions) is deduced from separate concordant passages in\r\nhis various books (in particular _Menschliches Allzumenschliches_,\r\n_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, and _Zur Genealogie der Moral_). I will\r\ntake it for a moment and subject it to criticism, before confronting it\r\nwith Nietzsche’s own assertions diametrically opposed to it.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the anthropological assertion. Man is supposed to have been a\r\nfreely roaming solitary beast of prey, whose primordial instinct was\r\negoism and the absence of any consideration for his congeners. This\r\nassertion contradicts all that we know concerning the beginnings of\r\nhumanity. The _Kjökkenmöddinge_, or kitchen-middens, of quaternary\r\nman, discovered and investigated by Steenstrup, have in some places a\r\nthickness of three metres, and must have been formed by a very numerous\r\nhorde. The piles of horses’ bones at Solutré are so enormous as quite\r\nto preclude the idea that a single hunter, or even any but a very\r\nlarge body of allied hunters, could have collected and killed such a\r\nlarge number of horses in one place. As far as our view penetrates\r\ninto prehistoric time, every discovery shows us primitive man as a\r\ngregarious animal, who could not possibly have maintained himself if\r\nhe had not possessed the instincts which are presupposed in life in\r\na community, viz., sympathy, the feeling of solidarity and a certain\r\ndegree of unselfishness. We find these instincts already existent in\r\napes; and if, in those most like human beings, the ourang-outang and\r\ngibbon, these instincts fail to appear, it is to many investigators a\r\nsufficient proof that these animals are degenerating and dying out.\r\nHence it is not true that at any time man was a ‘solitary, roving\r\nbrute.’\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the historical assertion. At first the morality\r\nof masters is supposed to have prevailed, in which every selfish\r\nact of violence seemed good, every sort of unselfishness bad. The\r\ninverted valuation of deeds and feelings is said to have been the\r\nwork of a slave-revolt. The Jews are said to have discovered ‘ascetic\r\nmorality,’ _i.e._, the ideal of combating all desires, contempt of all\r\npleasures of the flesh, pity, and brotherly love, in order to avenge\r\nthemselves on their oppressors, the masters--the ‘blond beasts of\r\nprey.’ I have shown above, the insanity of this idea of a conscious\r\nand purposed act of vengeance on the part of the Jewish people. But\r\nis it, then, true that our present morality, with its conceptions\r\nof good and evil, is an invention of the Jews, directed against\r\n‘blond beasts,’ an enterprise of slaves against a master-people? The\r\nleading doctrines of the present morality, falsely termed Christian,\r\nwere expressed in Buddhism six hundred years prior to the rise of\r\nChristianity. Buddha preached them, himself no slave, but a king’s\r\nson, and they were the moral doctrines, not of slaves, not of the\r\noppressed, but of the very masterfolk themselves, of the Brahmans,\r\nof the proper Aryans. The following are some of the Buddhist moral\r\ndoctrines, extracted from the Hindu _Dhammapada_[376] and from the\r\nChinese _Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king_:[377] ‘Do not speak harshly to anybody’\r\n(_Dhammapada_, verse 133). ‘Let us live happily then, not hating those\r\nwho hate us! Among men who hate us let us dwell free from hatred’\r\n(verse 197). ‘Because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore\r\nis a man called Ariya’ (elect) (verse 270). ‘Be not thoughtless, watch\r\nyour thoughts!’ (verse 327). ‘Good is restraint in all things’ (verse\r\n361). ‘Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who, though he has committed no\r\noffence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes’ (verse 399). ‘Be kind\r\nto all that lives’ (_Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king_, verse 2,024). ‘Conquer\r\nyour foe by force, you increase his enmity; conquer by love, and\r\nyou will reap no after-sorrow’ (verse 2,241). Is that a morality of\r\nslaves or of masters? Is it a notion of roving beasts of prey, or\r\nthat of compassionate, unselfish, social human beings? And this\r\nnotion did not spring up in Palestine, but in India, among the very\r\npeople of the conquering Aryans, who were ruling a subordinate race;\r\nand in China, where at that time no conquering race held another in\r\nsubjection. Self-sacrifice for others, pity and sympathy, are supposed\r\nto be the morality of Jewish slaves. Was the heroic baboon mentioned\r\nby Darwin,[378] after Brehm, a Jewish slave in revolt against the\r\nmasterfolk of blond beasts?\r\n\r\nIn the ‘blond beast’ Nietzsche evidently is thinking of the ancient\r\nGermans of the migratory ages. They have inspired in him the idea of\r\nthe roving beast of prey, falling upon weaker men for the voluptuous\r\nassuaging of their instincts of bloodthirstiness and destruction.\r\nThis beast of prey never entered into contracts. ‘He who comes on\r\nthe scene violent in deed and demeanour ... what has he to do with\r\ncontracts?’[379] Very well; history teaches that the ‘blond beast,’\r\n_i.e._, the ancient German of the migratory ages, not yet affected by\r\nthe ‘slave-revolt in morals,’ was a vigorous but peace-loving peasant,\r\nwho made war not to riot in murder, but to obtain arable land, and who\r\nalways first sought to conclude peaceful treaties before necessity\r\nforced him to have recourse to the sword.[380] And long before\r\nintelligence of the ‘ascetic ideal’ of Jewish Christianity reached it,\r\nthe same ‘blond beast’ developed the conception of feudal fidelity,\r\n_i.e._, the notion that it is most glorious for a man to divest himself\r\nof his own ‘I’; to know honour only as the resplendence of another’s\r\nhonour, of whom one has become the ‘man’; and to sacrifice his life for\r\nthe chief!\r\n\r\nConscience is supposed to be ‘cruelty introverted.’ As the man to whom\r\nit is an irrepressible want to inflict pain, to torture, and to rend,\r\ncannot assuage this want on others, he satisfies it on himself.[381]\r\n\r\nIf this were true, then the respectable, the virtuous man, who had\r\nnever satisfied the pretended primeval instinct of causing pain by\r\nmeans of a crime against others, would be forced to rage the most\r\nviolently against himself, and would therefore of necessity have the\r\nworst conscience. Conversely, the criminal directing his fundamental\r\ninstinct outwardly, and hence having no need to seek satisfaction in\r\nself-rending, would necessarily live in the most delightful peace with\r\nhis conscience. Does this agree with observation? Has a righteous man\r\nwho has not given way to the instinct of cruelty ever been seen to\r\nsuffer from the stings of conscience? Are these not, on the contrary,\r\nto be observed in the very persons who have yielded to their instinct,\r\nwho have been cruel to others, and hence have attained to that\r\nsatisfaction of their craving, vouchsafed them, according to Nietzsche,\r\nby the evil conscience? Nietzsche says,[382] ‘It is precisely among\r\ncriminals and offenders that remorse is extremely rare; prisons and\r\nreformatories are not the brooding places in which this species of worm\r\nloves to thrive,’ and believes that in this remark he has given a proof\r\nof his assertion. But by the commission of crime prisoners have shown\r\nthat in them the instinct of evil is developed in special strength;\r\nin the prison they are forcibly prevented from giving way to their\r\ninstinct; it is, therefore, precisely in them that self-rending through\r\nremorse ought to be extraordinarily violent, and yet among them ‘the\r\nprick of conscience is extremely rare.’ It is evident that Nietzsche’s\r\nidea is nothing but a delirious sally, and not worthy for a moment to\r\nbe weighed seriously against the explanation of conscience proposed by\r\nDarwin, and accepted by all moral philosophers.[383]\r\n\r\nNow for the philological argument. Originally, _bonus_ is supposed to\r\nhave read _duonus_, and hence signified ‘man of discord, disunion\r\n(_duo_), warrior.’[384] The proof of the ancient form _duonus_ is\r\noffered by ‘_bellum_ = _duellum_ = _duen-lum_.’ Now _duen-lum_ is\r\nnever met with, but is a free invention of Nietzsche, as is equally\r\n_duonus_. How admirable is this method! He invents a word _duonus_\r\nwhich does not exist, and bases it on the word _duen-lum_, which\r\nis just as non-existent and equally drawn from imagination. The\r\nphilology here displayed by Nietzsche is on a level with that which has\r\ncreated the beautiful and convincing series of derivations _alopex_\r\n= _lopex_ = _pexpix_ = _pux_ = _fechs_ = _fichs_ = _Fuchs_ (fox).\r\nNietzsche is uncommonly proud of his discovery, that the conception\r\nof _Schuld_ (guilt) is derived from the very narrow and material\r\nconception of _Schulden_ (debts).[385] Even if we admit the accuracy\r\nof this derivation, what has his theory gained by it? This would only\r\nprove that, in the course of time, the crudely material and limited\r\nconception had become enlarged, deepened, and spiritualized. To whom\r\nhas it ever occurred to contest this fact? What dabbler in the history\r\nof civilization does not know that conceptions develop themselves? Did\r\nlove and friendship, as primitively understood, ever convey the idea\r\nof the delicate and manifold states of mind now expressed by these\r\nwords? It is possible that the first guilt of which men were conscious\r\nwas the duty of restoring a loan. But neither can guilt, in the sense\r\nof a material obligation, arise amongst ‘blond brutes,’ or ‘cruel\r\nbeasts of prey.’ It already presupposes a relation of contract, the\r\nrecognition of a right of possession, respect for other individuals.\r\nIt is not possible if there does not exist, on the part of the lender,\r\nthe disposition to be agreeable to a fellow-creature, and a trust in\r\nthe readiness of the latter to requite the benefit; and, on the part\r\nof the borrower, a voluntary submission to the disagreeable necessity\r\nof repayment. And all these feelings are really already morality--a\r\nsimple, but true, morality--the real ‘slave-morality’ of duty,\r\nconsideration, sympathy, self-constraint; not the ‘master-morality’ of\r\nselfishness, cruel violence, unbounded desires! Even if single words\r\nlike the German _schlecht_ (_schlicht_) (bad, plain, or straight) have\r\nto-day a meaning the opposite of their original one, this is not to\r\nbe explained by a fabulous ‘transvaluation of values,’ but, naturally\r\nand obviously, by Abel’s theory of the ‘contrary double-meaning of\r\nprimitive words.’ The same sound originally served to designate the two\r\nopposites of the same concept, appearing, in agreement with the law of\r\nassociation, simultaneously in consciousness, and it was only in the\r\nlater life of language that the word became the exclusive vehicle of\r\none or other of the contrary concepts. This phenomenon has not the\r\nremotest connection with a change in the moral valuation of feelings\r\nand acts.\r\n\r\nNow the biological argument. The prevailing morality is supposed to\r\nbe admittedly of a character tending to improve the chances of life\r\nin gregarious animals, but to be an obstacle to the cultivation of\r\nthe highest human type, and hence pernicious to humanity as a whole,\r\nas it prevents the race from rising to the most perfect culture, and\r\nthe attainment of its possible ideal. Hence the most perfect human\r\ntype would, according to Nietzsche, be the ‘magnificent beast of\r\nprey,’ the ‘laughing lion,’ able to satisfy all his desires without\r\nconsideration for good or evil. Observation teaches that this doctrine\r\nis rank idiocy. All ‘over-men’ known to history, who gave the reins\r\nto their instincts, were either diseased from the outset, or became\r\ndiseased. Famous criminals--and Nietzsche expressly ranks these\r\namong the ‘over-men’[386]--have displayed, almost without exception,\r\nthe bodily and mental stigmata characterizing them as degenerates,\r\nand hence as cripples or atavistic phenomena, not as specimens of\r\nthe highest evolution and florescence. The Cæsars, whose monstrous\r\nselfishness could batten on all humanity, succumbed to madness, which\r\nit will hardly be wished to designate as an ideal condition. Nietzsche\r\nreadily admits that the ‘splendid beast of prey’ is pernicious to the\r\nspecies, that he destroys and ravages; but of what consequence is the\r\nspecies? It exists for the sole purpose of making possible the perfect\r\ndevelopment of individual ‘over-men,’ and of satisfying their most\r\nextravagant needs.[387] But the ‘splendid beast of prey’ is pernicious\r\nto itself; it rages against itself, it even annihilates itself,\r\nand yet that cannot possibly be a useful result of highly-trained\r\nqualities. The biological truth is, that constant self-restraint is a\r\nnecessity of existence as much for the strongest as for the weakest.\r\nIt is the activity of the highest human cerebral centres. If these\r\nare not exercised they waste away, _i.e._, man ceases to be man, the\r\npretended ‘over-man’ becomes sub-human--in other words, a beast. By\r\nthe relaxation or breaking up of the mechanism of inhibition in the\r\nbrain the organism sinks into irrecoverable anarchy in its constituent\r\nparts, and this leads, with absolute certainty, to ruin, to disease,\r\nmadness and death, even if no resistance results from the external\r\nworld against the frenzied egoism of the unbridled individual.\r\n\r\nWhat now remains standing of Nietzsche’s entire system? We have\r\nrecognised it as a collection of crazy and inflated phrases, which it\r\nis really impossible seriously to seize, since they possess hardly\r\nthe solidity of the smoke-rings from a cigar. Nietzsche’s disciples\r\nare for ever murmuring about the ‘depth’ of his moral philosophy, and\r\nwith himself the words ‘deep’ and ‘depth’ are a mental trick repeated\r\nso constantly as to be insufferable.[388] If we draw near to this\r\n‘depth’ for the purpose of fathoming it, we can hardly trust our eyes.\r\nNietzsche has not thought out one of his so-called ideas. Not one of\r\nhis wild assertions is carried a finger’s-breadth beneath the uppermost\r\nsurface, so that, at least, it might withstand the faintest puff of\r\nbreath. It is probable that the entire history of philosophy does not\r\nrecord a second instance of a man having the impudence to give out as\r\nphilosophy, and even as profound philosophy, such railway-bookstall\r\nhumour and such tea-table wit. Nietzsche sees absolutely nothing of\r\nthe moral problem, around which, nevertheless, he has poured out ten\r\nvolumes of talk. Rationally treated, this problem can only run thus:\r\nCan human actions be divided into good and evil? Why should some be\r\ngood, the others evil? What is to constrain men to perform the good and\r\nrefrain from the evil?\r\n\r\nNietzsche would seem to deny the legitimacy of a classification\r\nof actions from moral standpoints. ‘Nothing is true, all is\r\npermissible.’[389] There is no good and no evil. It is a superstition\r\nand hereditary prejudice to cling to these artificial notions. He\r\nhimself stands ‘beyond good and evil,’ and he invites the ‘free\r\nspirits’ and ‘good Europeans’ to follow him to this standpoint. And\r\nthereupon this ‘free spirit,’ standing ‘beyond good and evil,’ speaks\r\nwith the greatest candour of the ‘aristocratic virtues,’[390] and of\r\nthe ‘morality of the masters.’ Are there, then, virtues? Is there,\r\nthen, a morality, even if it be opposed to the prevailing one? How is\r\nthat compatible with the negation of all morality? Are men’s actions,\r\ntherefore, not of equal value? Is it possible in these to distinguish\r\ngood and evil? Does Nietzsche, therefore, undertake to classify them,\r\ndesignating some as virtues--‘aristocratic virtues’--others as ‘slave\r\nactions,’ bad for the ‘masters, the commanders,’ and hence wicked;\r\nhow, then, can he still affirm that he stands ‘beyond good and evil’?\r\nHe stands, in fact, mid-way between good and evil, only he indulges\r\nin the foolish jest of calling that evil which we call good, and\r\n_vice-versâ_--an intellectual performance of which every naughty and\r\nmischievous child of four is certainly capable.\r\n\r\nThis first and astounding non-comprehension of his own standpoint\r\nis already a good example of his ‘depth.’ But further. As the chief\r\nproof of the non-existence of morality, he adduces what he calls the\r\n‘transvaluation of values.’ At one time good is said to have been that\r\nwhich is now esteemed evil, and conversely. We have seen that this idea\r\nis delirious, and expressed in a delirious way.[391] But let it be\r\ngranted that Nietzsche is right; we will for once enter into the folly\r\nand accept the ‘revolt of slaves in morality’ as a fact. What has his\r\nfundamental idea gained by this? A ‘transvaluation of values’ would\r\nprove nothing against the existence of a morality, for it leaves the\r\nconcept of value itself absolutely intact. These, then, are values; but\r\nnow this, now that, species of action acquires the rank of value. No\r\nhistorian of civilization denies the fact that the notions concerning\r\nwhat is moral or immoral have changed in the course of history, that\r\nthey continually change, that they will change in the future. The\r\nrecognition of this has become a commonplace. If Nietzsche assumes this\r\nto be a discovery of his own, he deserves to be decked with a fool’s\r\ncap by the assistant teacher of a village school. But how can the\r\nevolution, the transformation, of moral concepts in any way contradict\r\nthe fundamental fact of the existence of moral concepts? Not only does\r\nthis transformation not contradict these, but it confirms them! They\r\nare the necessary premise of this transformation! A modification of\r\nmoral concepts is evidently possible only if there are moral concepts;\r\nbut this is exactly the problem--‘are there moral concepts?’ In spite\r\nof all his spouting about the ‘transvaluation of values’ and the\r\n‘revolt of slaves in morality,’ Nietzsche never approaches this primary\r\nand all-important question.\r\n\r\nHe contemptuously reproaches slave-morality as being a utilitarian\r\nmorality,[392] and he ignores the fact that he extols his ‘noble\r\nvirtues,’ constituting the ‘morality of masters,’ only because\r\nthey are advantageous for the individual, for the ‘over-man.’[393]\r\nAre, then, ‘advantageous’ and ‘useful’ not exactly synonymous?\r\nIs, therefore, master-morality not every whit as utilitarian as\r\nslave-morality? And the ‘deep’ Nietzsche does not see this! And he\r\nridicules English moralists because they have invented the ‘morality of\r\nutilitarianism.’[394]\r\n\r\nHe believes he has unearthed something deeply hidden, not yet descried\r\nby human eye, when he announces,[395] ‘What is there that is not\r\ncalled love? Covetousness and love--what different feelings do we\r\nexperience at each of these words! And yet it might be the same\r\ninstinct.... Our love for our neighbours--is it not an ardent desire\r\nfor a possession?... When we see anyone suffering, we willingly\r\nutilize the opportunity ‘ proferred us to take possession of him;\r\nthe pitying and charitable man, for example, does this; he also\r\ncalls by the name “love” the desire for a new possession awakened in\r\nhim, and takes pleasure in it, as he would in a fresh conquest which\r\nbeckons him on.’ Is it any longer necessary to criticise these silly\r\nsuperficialities? Every act, even seemingly the most disinterested, is\r\nadmittedly egoistic in a certain sense, viz., that the doer promises\r\nhimself a benefit from it, and experiences a feeling of pleasure from\r\nthe anticipation of the expected benefit. Who has ever denied this? Is\r\nit not expressly emphasized by all modern moralists?[396] Is it not\r\nimplied in the accepted definition of morality, as a knowledge of what\r\nis useful? But Nietzsche has not even an inkling of the essence of the\r\nsubject. To him egoism is a feeling having for its content that which\r\nis useful to a being, whom he pictures to himself as isolated in the\r\nworld, separated from the species, even hostile to it. To the moralist,\r\nthe egoism which Nietzsche believes himself to have discovered at the\r\nbase of all unselfishness, is the knowledge of what is useful not\r\nalone to the individual, but to the species as well; to the moralist,\r\nthe creator of the knowledge of the useful is not the individual, but\r\nthe whole species; to the moralist also egoism is morality, but it is\r\na collective egoism of the species, an egoism of humanity in face of\r\nthe non-human co-habitants of the earth, and in the face of Nature.\r\nThe man whom the healthy-minded moralist has before his eyes is one\r\nwho has attained a sufficiently high development to extricate himself\r\nfrom the illusion of his individual isolation, and to participate in\r\nthe existence of the species, to feel himself one of its members, to\r\npicture to himself the states of his fellow-creatures--_i.e._, to be\r\nable to sympathize with them. This man Nietzsche calls a herd animal--a\r\nterm which he has found used by all Darwinist writers, but which he\r\nseems to regard as his own invention. He endows the word with a meaning\r\nof contempt. The truth is that this herding animal--_i.e._, man, whose\r\n‘I’ consciousness has expanded itself to the capacity of receiving\r\nthe consciousness of the species--represents the higher development,\r\nto which mental cripples and degenerates, for ever enclosed in their\r\ndiseased isolation, cannot ascend.\r\n\r\nQuite as ‘deep’ as his discovery of the egoism of all unselfishness\r\nis Nietzsche’s harangue ‘to the teachers of unselfishness.’[397] The\r\nvirtues of a man are called good, not in respect of their effects upon\r\nhimself, but in respect of the effects which we suppose them to have\r\nupon ourselves and society. ‘The virtues (such as diligence, obedience,\r\nchastity, piety, justice), are for the most part pernicious to their\r\npossessors.’ ‘Praise of the virtues is praise of something pernicious\r\nto the individual--the praise of instincts which deprive a man of his\r\nnoblest egoism, and of the power of the highest self-protection.’\r\n‘Education ... seeks to determine the individual to modes of thought\r\nand conduct which, if they have become habit, instinct, and passion,\r\nrule in him and over him, against his ultimate advantage, but “for\r\nthe general good.”’ This is the old silly objection against altruism\r\nwhich we have seen floating in every gutter for the last sixty years.\r\n‘If everyone were to act unselfishly, to sacrifice himself for his\r\nneighbour, the result would be that everyone would injure himself,\r\nand hence humanity, as a whole, would suffer great prejudice.’\r\nAssuredly it would, if humanity were composed of isolated individuals\r\nin no communication with each other. Whereas it is an organism; each\r\nindividual always gives to the higher organism only the surplus of\r\nhis effective force, and in his personal share of the collective\r\nwealth profits by the prosperity of the whole organism, which he has\r\nincreased through his altruistic sacrifice. What would probably be said\r\nto the canny householder who should argue in this way against fire\r\ninsurance: ‘Most houses do not burn down. The house-owner who insures\r\nhimself against fire pays premiums his life long, and as his house will\r\nprobably never burn down, he has thrown away his money to no purpose.\r\nFire insurance is consequently injurious.’ The objection against\r\naltruism, that it injures each individual by imposing on him sacrifices\r\nfor others, is of exactly the same force.\r\n\r\nWe have had quite enough tests of the ‘depth’ of Nietzsche and\r\nhis system. I now wish to point out some of his most diverting\r\ncontradictions. His disciples do not deny these, but seek to palliate\r\nthem. Thus Kaatz says: ‘He had experienced a change in his own views\r\nconcerning so many things, that he warned men against the rigid\r\nprinciple which would pass off dishonesty to self as “character.” In\r\nview of the shifting of opinions as evidenced in Nietzsche’s works, it\r\nis, of course, only that theory of life to which Nietzsche ultimately\r\nwrestled his way that can be taken into consideration for the purposes\r\nof this book.’[398] This is, however, a conscious and intended\r\nfalsification of the facts, and the hand of the falsifier ought, like\r\nthat of the cheater at cards, to be forthwith nailed to the table.\r\nThe fact is that the contradictions are to be found, not in works of\r\ndifferent periods, but in the same book, often on the same page. They\r\nare not degrees of knowledge, of which the higher naturally surpass\r\nthe lower, but opposing, mutually incompatible opinions co-existing in\r\nNietzsche’s consciousness, which his judgment is neither capable of\r\nreconciling, nor among which it can suppress either term.\r\n\r\nIn _Also sprach Zarathustra_, pt. iii., p. 29, we read: ‘Always love\r\nyour neighbour as yourself, but first be of those who love themselves.’\r\np. 56: ‘And at that time it happened also ... that his word praised\r\nselfishness as blessed, hale, healthy selfishness, which wells forth\r\nfrom the mighty soul.’ And p. 60: ‘One must learn to love one’s\r\nself--thus I teach--with a hale and healthy love, so that one bear with\r\none’s self, and not rove about.’ In opposition to this, in the same\r\nbook, pt. i., p. 108: ‘The degenerating sense which says, “All for me,”\r\nis to us a horror.’ Is this contradiction explained by an ‘effort to\r\nwrestle his way to an ultimate theory of life’? The contrary assertions\r\nare in the same book a few pages apart.\r\n\r\nAnother example. _Die fröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 264: ‘The absence\r\nof personality avenges itself everywhere; an enfeebled, thin, effaced\r\npersonality, denying and calumniating itself, is worthless for any\r\nfurther good thing, most of all for philosophy.’ And only four pages\r\nfurther in the same book, p. 268: ‘Have we not been seized with ...\r\nthe suspicion of a contrast--a contrast between the world--in which,\r\nhitherto, we were at home with our venerations ... and of another\r\nworld, which is ourselves ... a suspicion which might place us\r\nEuropeans ... before the frightful alternative, Either--Or: “either do\r\naway with your venerations or yourselves.”’ Here, therefore, he denies,\r\nor, at least, doubts, his personality, even if in an interrogative\r\nform; on which the reader need not dwell, since Nietzsche ‘loves\r\nto mask his thoughts, or to express them hypothetically; and to\r\nconclude the problems he raises by an interrupted phrase or a mark of\r\ninterrogation.’[399]\r\n\r\nBut he denies his personality, his ‘I,’ still more decidedly. In the\r\npreface to _Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, p. 6, he explains that the\r\nfoundation of all philosophies up to the present time has been ‘some\r\npopular superstition,’ such as ‘the superstition of the soul, which,\r\nas a superstition of the subjective and the ‘I,’ as not ceased, even\r\nin our days, to cause mischief.’ And in the same book, p. 139, he\r\nexclaims: ‘Who has not already been sated to the point of death with\r\nall subjectivity and his own accursed ipsissimosity!’ Hence the ‘I’\r\nis a superstition! Sated to the point of death with ‘subjectivity’!\r\nAnd yet the ‘I’ should be ‘proclaimed as holy.’[400] And yet the\r\n‘ripest fruit of society and morality is the sovereign individual, who\r\nresembles himself alone.’[401] And yet ‘a personality which denies\r\nitself is no longer good for anything’!\r\n\r\nThe negation of the ‘I,’ the designation of it as a superstition,\r\nis the more extraordinary, as Nietzsche’s whole philosophy--if one\r\nmay call his effusions by that name--is based only on the ‘Ego,’\r\nrecognising it as alone justifiable, or even as alone existing.\r\n\r\nIn all Nietzsche’s works we shall, it is true, find no more subversive\r\ncontradiction than this; but a few other examples will show to\r\nwhat extent he holds mutually-destructive opposites in his mind in\r\nuncompromising juxtaposition.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that his last piece of wisdom is: ‘Nothing is true;\r\nall is permissible.’ At bottom all those ethics are repugnant to me\r\nwhich say: ‘Do not do this! Renounce! Overcome self!’ ‘Self-command!’\r\nThose ethical teachers who ... enjoin man to place himself in his own\r\npower induce thereby in him a peculiar disease.[402] And now let the\r\nfollowing sentences be weighed: ‘Through auspicious marriage customs\r\nthere is a continual increase in the power and pleasure of willing,\r\nin the will to command self.’ ‘Asceticism and puritanism are almost\r\nindispensable means of education and ennoblement, if a race desires\r\nto triumph over its plebeian origin, and raise itself at some time to\r\nsovereignty.’ ‘The essential and priceless feature of every morality is\r\nthat it is a long constraint.’[403]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the over-human is his wish to stand alone, to\r\nseek solitude, to flee from the society of the gregarious. ‘He should\r\nbe the greatest who can be the most solitary.’ ‘The lofty independent\r\nspirituality--the will to stand alone.... (_Jenseits von Gut und\r\nBöse_, pp. 154, 123.) ‘The strong are constrained by their nature to\r\nsegregate, as much as the feeble are by theirs to aggregate’ (_Zur\r\nGenealogie der Moral_, p. 149). In opposition to this he teaches in\r\nother places: ‘During the longest interval in the life of humanity\r\nthere was nothing more terrible than to feel one’s self alone’ (_Die\r\nfröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 147). Again: ‘We at present sometimes\r\nundervalue the advantages of life in a community’ (_Zur Genealogie der\r\nMoral_, p. 59). We? That is a calumny. We value these advantages at\r\ntheir full worth. He alone does not value them who, in expressions of\r\nadmiration, vaunts ‘segregation,’ _i.e._, hostility to the community\r\nand contempt of its advantages, as characterizing the strong.\r\n\r\nAt one time the primitive aristocratic man is the freely-roving,\r\nsplendid beast of prey, the blond beast; at another: ‘these men\r\nare rigorously kept within bounds by morality, veneration, custom,\r\ngratitude, still more by reciprocal surveillance, by jealousy _inter\r\npares_; and, on the other hand, in their attitude towards each other,\r\ninventive in consideration, self-command, delicacy, fidelity, pride,\r\nand friendship.’ Ay, if these be the attributes of ‘blond beasts,’\r\nmay someone speedily give us a society of ‘blond beasts’! But how\r\ndoes ‘morality, veneration, self-command,’ etc., accord with the\r\n‘free-roving’ of the splendid beast of prey? That remains an unsolved\r\nenigma. It is true that Nietzsche, while making our mouths water by his\r\ndescription, adds to it this limitation: ‘Towards what lies beyond,\r\nwhere the stranger, and what is strange, begins, they are not much\r\nbetter than beasts of prey set free’ (_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p.\r\n21). But this is in reality no limitation. Every organized community\r\nregards itself, in respect of the rest of the world, as a conjoint\r\nunity, and does not accord to the foreigner, the man from without,\r\nthe same rights as to a member of its own body. Rights, custom,\r\nconsideration, are not extended to the stranger, unless he knows how to\r\ninspire fear and to compel a recognition of his rights. The progress in\r\ncivilization, however, consists in the very fact that the boundaries\r\nof the community are continually enlarged, that which is strange and\r\nwithout rights or claim to consideration being constantly made to\r\nrecede further and ever further. At first there existed in the horde\r\nreciprocal forbearance and right alone; then the feeling of solidarity\r\nextended itself to the tribe, the country, state, and race. At the\r\npresent day there is an international law even in war; the best among\r\ncontemporaries feel themselves one with all men, nay, no longer hold\r\neven the animal to be without rights; and the time will come when the\r\nforces of Nature will be the sole strange and external things which\r\nmay be treated according to man’s need and pleasure, and in regard to\r\nwhich he may be the ‘freed beast of prey.’ The ‘deep’ Nietzsche is not\r\ncapable, it is true, of comprehending a state of the case so simple and\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nAt one moment he makes merry over the ‘naïveté’ of those who believe\r\nin an original social contract (_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p. 80),\r\nand then says (in the same book, p. 149): ‘If they’ (the strong, the\r\nborn masters, the ‘species of solitary beasts of prey’) ‘unite, it\r\nis only with a view to a collective act of aggression, a collective\r\nsatisfaction of their volition to exert their power, with much\r\nresistance from the individual conscience.’ With resistance or without,\r\ndoes not a ‘union for the purpose of a collective satisfaction’ amount\r\nto a relation of contract, the acceptation of which Nietzsche with\r\njustice terms ‘a naïveté’?\r\n\r\nAt one time ‘agony is something which inspires pity’ (_Jenseits von\r\nGut und Böse_, p. 136), and a ‘succession of crimes is horrible’ (_Zur\r\nGenealogie der Moral_, p. 21); and then, again, the ‘beauty’ of crime\r\nis spoken of (_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, p. 91), and complaint is\r\nmade that ‘crime is calumniated’ (the same book, p. 123).\r\n\r\nExamples enough have been given. I do not wish to lose myself in\r\nminutiæ and details, but I believe that I have demonstrated Nietzsche’s\r\nown contradiction of every single one of his fundamental assertions,\r\nmost emphatically of the foremost and most important, viz., that the\r\n‘I’ is the one real thing, that egoism alone is necessitated and\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nIf the conceits which he wildly ejaculates--as it were, shrieks\r\nforth--are examined somewhat more closely, we cannot but marvel at\r\nthe profusion of fabulous stupidity and abecedarian ignorance they\r\ncontain. It is thus he terms the system of Copernicus (_Jenseits von\r\nGut und Böse_), ‘which has persuaded us, against all the senses,\r\nthat the earth is not immovable,’ ‘the greatest triumph over the\r\nsenses hitherto achieved on earth.’ Hence he does not suspect that\r\nthe system of Copernicus has for its basis exact observation of\r\nthe starry heavens, the movements of the moon and planets, and the\r\nposition of the sun in the zodiac; that this system was, therefore,\r\nthe triumph of exact sense-perceptions over sense-illusions--in other\r\nwords, of attentiveness over fugacity and distraction. He believes\r\nthat ‘consciousness developed itself under the pressure of the need of\r\ncommunication,’ for ‘conscious thought eventuates in words, _i.e._,\r\nin signs of communication, by which fact the origin of consciousness\r\nitself is revealed’ (_Die fröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 280). He does\r\nnot know, then, that animals without the power of speech also have\r\na consciousness; that it is possible also to think in images, in\r\nrepresentations of movement, without the help of a word, and that\r\nspeech is not added to consciousness until very late in the course of\r\ndevelopment. The drollest thing is that Nietzsche very much fancies\r\nhimself as a psychologist, and wishes most particularly to be esteemed\r\nas such! According to this profound man, socialism has its roots in\r\nthe fact that ‘hitherto manufacturers and entrepreneurs lack those\r\nforms and signs of distinction of the higher races which alone make\r\npersons interesting; if they had in look and gesture the distinction of\r\nthose born noble, there would, perhaps, be no socialism of the masses\r\n[!!]. For the latter are at bottom ready for slavery of every kind,\r\non the condition that the higher class constantly legitimizes itself\r\nas higher, as born to command, by outward distinction’ [!!] (_Die\r\nfröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 68). The concept ‘thou oughtest,’ the idea\r\nof duty, of the necessity of a definite measure of self-command, is\r\na consequence of the fact that ‘at all times since men have existed,\r\nhuman herds have also existed, and always a very large number of those\r\nwho obey relatively to the small number of those who command (_Jenseits\r\nvon Gut und Böse_, p. 118). Anyone less incapable of thought than\r\nNietzsche will understand that, on the contrary, human herds, those\r\nobeying and those commanding, were possible at all, only after and\r\nbecause the brain had acquired the power and capacity to elaborate\r\nthe idea, ‘thou oughtest,’ _i.e._, to inhibit an impulse by a thought\r\nor a judgment. The descendant of mixed races ‘will on the average be\r\na weaker being’ (_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, p. 120); indeed, the\r\n‘European _Weltschmerz_, the pessimism of the nineteenth century, is\r\nessentially the consequence of a sudden and irrational mixture of\r\nclasses’; social classes, however, always ‘express differences of\r\norigin and of race as well’ (_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p. 142). The\r\nmost competent investigators are convinced, as we well know, that the\r\ncrossing of one race with another is conducive to the progress of\r\nboth, and is ‘the first cause of development.’[404] ‘Darwinism, with\r\nits incomprehensibly one-sided theory of the struggle for existence,’\r\nis explained by Darwin’s origin. His ancestors were ‘poor and humble\r\npersons who were only too familiar with the difficulty of making both\r\nends meet. Around the whole of English Darwinism there floats, as it\r\nwere, the mephitic vapour of English over-population, the odour of\r\nhumble life, of pinched and straitened circumstances’ (_Die fröhliche\r\nWissenschaft_, p. 273). It is presumably known to all my readers\r\nthat Darwin was a rich man, and was never compelled to follow any\r\nprofession, and that, for at least three or four generations, his\r\nancestors had lived in comfort.\r\n\r\nNietzsche lays special claim to extraordinary originality. He places\r\nthis epigraph at the beginning of his _Fröhliche Wissenschaft_:\r\n\r\n  ‘I live in a house that’s my own,\r\n  I’ve never in nought copied no one,\r\n  And at every Master I’ve had my laugh,\r\n  Who had not first laughed at himself.’\r\n\r\nHis disciples believe in this brag, and, with upturned eyes, bleat\r\nit after him in sheep-like chorus. The profound ignorance of this\r\nflock of ruminants permits them, forsooth, to believe in Nietzsche’s\r\noriginality. As they have never learnt, read, or thought about,\r\nanything, all that they pick up in bars, or in their loafings, is\r\nnaturally new and hitherto non-existent. Anyone, however, who regards\r\nNietzsche relatively to analogous phenomena of the age, will recognise\r\nthat his pretended originalities and temerities are the greasiest\r\ncommonplaces, such as a decent self-respecting thinker would not touch\r\nwith a pair of tongs.\r\n\r\nWhenever he rants, Nietzsche is no doubt really original. On such\r\noccasions his expressions contain no sense at all, not even nonsense;\r\nhence it is impossible to unite them with anything previously thought\r\nor said. When, on the contrary, there is a shimmer of reason in\r\nhis words, we at once recognise them as having their origin in the\r\nparadoxes or platitudes of others. Nietzsche’s ‘individualism’ is an\r\nexact reproduction of Max Stirner, a crazy Hegelian, who fifty years\r\nago exaggerated and involuntarily turned into ridicule the critical\r\nidealism of his master to the extent of monstrously inflating the\r\nimportance--even the grossly empirical importance--of the ‘I’; whom,\r\neven in his own day, no one took seriously, and who since then had\r\nfallen into well-merited profound oblivion, from which at the present\r\ntime a few anarchists and philosophical ‘fops’--for the hysteria of\r\nthe time has created such beings--seek to disinter him.[405] Where\r\nNietzsche extols the ‘I,’ its rights, its claims, the necessity of\r\ncultivating and developing it, the reader who has in mind the preceding\r\nchapters of this book will recognise the phrases of Barrès, Wilde,\r\nand Ibsen. His philosophy of will is appropriated from Schopenhauer,\r\nwho throughout has directed his thought and given colour to his\r\nlanguage. The complete similarity of his phrases concerning will with\r\nSchopenhauer’s theory has evidently penetrated to his own consciousness\r\nand made him uncomfortable; for, in order to obliterate it, he has\r\nplaced a false nose of his own invention on the cast he has made,\r\nviz., he contests the fact that the motive force in every being\r\nis the desire for self-preservation; in his view it is rather the\r\ndesire for power. This addition is pure child’s play. In the lower\r\norders of living beings it is never a ‘desire for power,’ but always\r\nonly a desire for self-preservation, that is perceptible; and among\r\nmen this seeming ‘desire for power’ can, by anyone but the ‘deep’\r\nNietzsche, be traced to two well-known roots--either to the effort to\r\nmake all organs act to the limit of their functional capacity, which\r\nis connected with feelings of pleasure, or to procure for themselves\r\nadvantages ameliorative of the conditions of existence. But the effort\r\ntowards feelings of pleasure and better conditions of existence is\r\nnothing but a form of the phenomenon of the desire for existence, and\r\nhe who regards the ‘desire for power’ as anything different from, and\r\neven opposed to, the desire for existence, simply gives evidence of\r\nhis incapacity to pursue this idea of the desire for existence any\r\ndistance beyond the length of his nose. Nietzsche’s chief proof of the\r\ndifference between the desire for power and the desire for existence\r\nis that the former often drives the desirer to the contemning and\r\nendangering, even to the destruction, of his own life. But in that case\r\nthe whole struggle for existence, in which dangers are continually\r\nincurred, and for that matter are often enough sought, would also be a\r\nproof that the struggler did not desire his existence! Nietzsche would,\r\nindeed, be quite capable of asserting this also.\r\n\r\nThe degenerates with whom we have become acquainted affirm that they\r\ndo not trouble themselves concerning Nature and its laws. Nietzsche is\r\nnot so far advanced in self-sufficiency as Rossetti, to whom it was a\r\nmatter of indifference whether the earth revolved around the sun or\r\nthe sun around the earth. He openly avows that this is not a matter of\r\nindifference to him; he regrets it; it troubles him, that the earth is\r\nno longer the central point of the universe, and be the chief thing\r\non the earth. ‘Since Copernicus, man seems to have fallen upon an\r\ninclined plane; he is now rolling ever faster away from the central\r\npoint--whither?--into the nothing? into the piercing feeling of his\r\nnothingness?’ He is very angry with Copernicus concerning this. Not\r\nonly with Copernicus, but with science in general. ‘All science is at\r\npresent busied in talking man out of the self-respect he has hitherto\r\npossessed, just as if this had been nothing but a bizarre self-conceit’\r\n(_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p. 173). Is this not an echo of the words\r\nof Oscar Wilde, who complains that Nature ‘is so indifferent’ to him,\r\n‘so unappreciative,’ and that he ‘is no more to Nature than the cattle\r\nthat browse on the slope’?\r\n\r\nIn other places, again, we find the current of thought and almost\r\nthe very words of Oscar Wilde, Huysmans, and other Diabolists and\r\nDecadents. The passage in _Zur Genealogie der Moral_ (p. 171) in\r\nwhich he glorifies art, because ‘in it the lie sanctifies itself, and\r\nthe will to deceive has a quiet conscience on its side,’ might be\r\nin the chapter in Wilde’s _Intentions_ on ‘The Decay of Lying,’ as,\r\nconversely, Wilde’s aphorisms: ‘There is no sin except stupidity.’ ‘An\r\nidea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.’\r\nAnd his praises of Wainwright, the poisoner, are in exact agreement\r\nwith Nietzsche’s ‘morality of assassins,’ and the latter’s remarks\r\nthat crime is calumniated, and that the defender of the criminal is\r\n‘oftenest not artist enough to turn the beautiful terribleness of the\r\ncrime to the advantage of the doer.’ Again, by way of joke, compare\r\nthese passages: ‘It is necessary to get rid of the bad taste of wishing\r\nto agree with many. Good is no longer good when a neighbour says it’s\r\ngood’ (Nietzsche, _Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, p. 54), and ‘Ah! don’t\r\nsay that you agree with me. When people agree with me, I always feel\r\nthat I must be wrong’ (Oscar Wilde, _Intentions_, p. 202). This is\r\nmore than a resemblance, is it not? To avoid being too diffuse, I\r\nabstain from citing passages exactly resembling these from Huysmans’\r\n_A Rebours_, and from Ibsen. At the same time it is unquestionable\r\nthat Nietzsche could not have known the French Decadents and English\r\nÆsthetes whom he so frequently approaches, because his books are\r\nin part antecedent to those of the latter; and neither could they\r\nhave drawn from him, because, perhaps with the exception of Ibsen,\r\nit is only about two years since they could have heard as much as\r\nNietzsche’s name. The similarity, or rather identity, is not explained\r\nby plagiarism; it is explained by the identity of mental qualities in\r\nNietzsche and the other ego-maniacal degenerates.\r\n\r\nNietzsche presents a specially droll aspect when he confronts truth, in\r\norder to declare it unnecessary, or even to deny its existence. ‘Why\r\nnot rather untruth? And uncertainty? Or even ignorance?’ (_Jenseits von\r\nGut und Böse_, p. 3). ‘What, after all, are the truths of man? They are\r\nthe irrefutable errors of man’ (_Die fröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 193).\r\n‘The will for truth--that might be a hidden will for death’ (_Ibid._,\r\np. 263). The section of this book in which he deals with the question\r\nof truth is entitled by him, ‘We the Fearless,’ and he prefixes to it,\r\nas a motto, Turenne’s utterance: ‘Thou tremblest, carcass? Thou wouldst\r\ntremble much more if thou knewest whither I shall soon lead thee!’ And\r\nwhat is this terrible danger into which the fearless one runs with\r\nsuch heroic mien? The investigation of the essence and value of truth.\r\nBut this investigation is really the A B C of all serious philosophy!\r\nThe question as to whether objective truth exists at all has been\r\nalso drawn up by him,[406] it is true with less blowing of trumpets,\r\nbeating of drums, and shaking of locks, as its prologue, accompaniment,\r\nand conclusion. It is, moreover, highly characteristic that the same\r\ndragon-slayer who, with such swaggering and snorting takes up the\r\nchallenge against ‘truth,’ finds submissive words of most humble\r\napology when he ventures very gently to doubt the perfection of Goethe\r\nin all his pieces. Speaking of the ‘viscosity’ and ‘tediousness’ of\r\nthe German style, he says (_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_, p. 39): ‘I may\r\nbe pardoned for affirming that even Goethe’s prose, with its mixture\r\nof stiffness and grace, is no exception.’ When he timidly criticises\r\nGoethe, he begs pardon; his heroic attitude of contempt for death is\r\nassumed only when he challenges morality and truth to combat. That is\r\nto say, this ‘fearless one’ possesses the cunning often observed among\r\nthe insane, and comprehends that there is absolutely no danger in his\r\nbabbling before the imbeciles composing his congregation, that fabulous\r\nphilosophical nonsense, at which, on the contrary, they would be much\r\nenraged the instant it shocked their æsthetic convictions or prejudices.\r\n\r\nEven in the minutest details it is surprising how Nietzsche agrees,\r\nword for word, with the other ego-maniacs with whom we have become\r\nacquainted. Compare, for example, the phrase in _Jenseits von Gut und\r\nBöse_, p. 168, where he vaunts, ‘What is really noble in works and\r\nin men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the\r\n_golden_ and the _cool_,’ with Baudelaire’s praise of immobility and\r\nhis enraptured description of a metallic landscape; or the remarks of\r\nDes Esseintes, and the side-thrusts at the press put by Ibsen into\r\nthe mouths of his characters, with the insults continually heaped on\r\nnewspapers by Nietzsche. ‘Great ascetic spirits have an abhorrence of\r\nbustle, veneration, newspaper’ (_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p. 113).\r\nThe cause of ‘the undeniably gradual and already tangible desolation\r\nof the German mind’ lies in being ‘all too exclusively nourished on\r\nnewspapers, politics, beer, and Wagnerian music’ (_Ibid._, p. 177).\r\n‘Behold these superfluities!... They vomit their bile, and name it a\r\nnewspaper’ (_Also sprach Zarathustra_, pt. i., p. 67). ‘Dost thou not\r\nsee the souls hanging like limp dirty rags? And they make newspapers\r\nout of those rags! Hearest thou not how the spirit has here become a\r\nplay on words? He vomits a loathsome swill of words. And of this swill\r\nof words they make newspapers!’ (_Ibid._, pt. iii., p. 37). It would be\r\npossible to multiply these examples tenfold, for Nietzsche harks back\r\nto every idea with an obstinacy enough to make the most patient reader\r\nof sound taste go wild.\r\n\r\nSuch is the appearance presented by Nietzsche’s originality. This\r\n‘original’ and ‘audacious’ thinker, imitating the familiar practices\r\nof tradesmen at ‘sales,’ endeavours to palm off as brand new goods\r\nthe most shop-worn rubbish of great philosophers. His most powerful\r\nassaults are directed against doors that stand open. This ‘solitary\r\none,’ this ‘dweller on the highest mountain peaks,’ exhibits by the\r\ndozen the physiognomy of all decadents. He who is continually talking\r\nwith the utmost contempt of the ‘herd’ and the ‘herd-animal’ is himself\r\nthe most ordinary herd-animal of all. Only the herd to which he\r\nbelongs, body and soul, is a special one; it is the flock of the mangy\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion the habitual cunning of the insane has deserted\r\nhim, and he has himself revealed to us the source of his ‘original’\r\nphilosophy. The passage is so characteristic that I must quote it at\r\nlength:\r\n\r\n‘The first impetus, to make known something of my hypotheses\r\nconcerning the origin of morality, was given me by a clear, tidy,\r\nand clever--ay, precocious [!]--little book, in which there was\r\nfor the first time presented to me an inverted and perverted kind\r\nof genealogical hypotheses, the truly _English_ kind, and which\r\nattracted me with that attractive force possessed by everything\r\ncontrary, everything antipodal. The title of this little book was\r\n_Der Ursprung der moralischen Empfindunger_ [“The Origin of Moral\r\nSensations”]; its author, Dr. Paul Rée; the year of its publication,\r\n1877. I have, perhaps, never read anything to which I have in the\r\nsame measure mentally said “No” as I did to every proposition and\r\nevery conclusion in this book, yet without anger or impatience.\r\nIn the previously-mentioned work on which I was at that time\r\nengaged [_Menschliches Allzumenschliches_--“Things Human, Things\r\nall too Human”], I referred, in season and out of season, to the\r\npropositions of that book, not refuting them--what have I to do with\r\nrefutations?--but, as befits a positive spirit, to substitute the more\r\nprobable for the improbable, and at times one error for another’ (_Zur\r\nGenealogie der Moral_, p. 7).\r\n\r\nThis gives the reader the key to Nietzsche’s ‘originality.’ It consists\r\nin simple infantile inversion of a rational train of thought. If\r\nNietzsche imagines that his insane negations and contradictions grew\r\nspontaneously in his head, he is really the victim of a self-delusion.\r\nHis rant may have existed in his mind before he had read Dr. Rée’s\r\nbook. But in that case it had sprung up as a contradiction to other\r\nbooks without his having been so clearly conscious of its origin as\r\nafter the perusal of Dr. Rée’s work. But he pushes the self-delusion to\r\nan incredible height, in terming himself a ‘positive spirit,’ after he\r\nhas just frankly confessed his method of procedure, viz., that he does\r\nnot ‘refute’--he would not have found that so easy, either--but that\r\n‘to every proposition, and every conclusion he says ‘No!’\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the source of his ‘original’ moral philosophy\r\ncomprehends in itself a diagnosis, which at once obtrudes on the most\r\nshort-sighted eye. Nietzsche’s system is the product of the mania of\r\ncontradiction, the delirious form of that mental derangement, of which\r\nthe melancholic form is the mania of doubt and negation, treated of in\r\nthe earlier chapters of this work. His _folie des négations_ betrays\r\nitself also in his peculiarities of language. There is ever in his\r\nconsciousness a questioning impulse like a mark of interrogation. Of\r\nno word is he so fond as of the interrogative ‘What?’ constantly used\r\nby him in the most marvellous connection,[407] and he makes use _ad\r\nnauseam_ of the turn of expression, that one should ‘say No’ to this\r\nand that, that this one and that one is a ‘No-sayer’--an expression\r\nwhich suggests to him by association the same immeasurably frequent use\r\nof the contrary expression, ‘say Yes’ and ‘Yes-sayer.’ This ‘saying-No’\r\nand ‘saying-Yes’ is in his case a veritable _Paraphasia vesana_,\r\nor insane language opposed to usage, as the reader is shown by the\r\nexamples cited in foot-note.[408]\r\n\r\nNietzsche’s assurance that ‘without anger or impatience’ he ‘said\r\nNo’ to all Rée’s assertions may be believed. Persons afflicted with\r\nthe mania of doubt and of denial do not get angry when they question\r\nor contradict; they do this under the coercion of their mental\r\nderangement. But those among them who are delirious have the conscious\r\nintention of making others angry, even if they themselves are not so.\r\nOn this point Nietzsche allows an avowal to escape him: ‘My mode of\r\nthought demands a warlike soul, a wish to give pain, a pleasure in\r\nsaying, No’ (_Die fröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 63). This confession may\r\nbe compared with the passages from Ibsen: ‘You were becoming reckless!\r\nIn reality that you might anger these affected beings of both sexes\r\nhere in the town’; and, ‘Something shall happen which will be a slap in\r\nthe face to all this decorum’ (_The Pillars of Society_).\r\n\r\nThe origin of one of the most ‘original’ of Nietzsche’s doctrines,\r\nviz., the explanation of conscience as a satisfaction of the instinct\r\nof cruelty through inner self-rending, has already been gone into by\r\nDr. Türck, in an excellent little work. He very justly recognises\r\nthe diseased state of moral aberration at the base of this insane\r\nidea,[409] and continues thus:\r\n\r\n‘Let us now picture to ourselves a man of this kind, with innate\r\ninstincts of murder, or in general with ‘Anomalies or perversion of\r\nthe moral feelings’ (Mendel); at the same time highly gifted, with the\r\nbest instruction and an excellent education, reared in the midst of\r\nagreeable circumstances, and under the careful ... nurture of women ...\r\nand occupying at an early age a prominent position in society. It is\r\nclear that the better moral instincts must gain such strength as to be\r\nable to drive back to the deepest inner depths the bestial instinct of\r\ndestruction and completely to curb it, yet without wholly annihilating\r\nit. It may not, indeed, be able to manifest itself in deeds, but,\r\nbecause it is inborn, the instinct remains in existence as an\r\nunfulfilled wish, cherished in the inmost heart ... as an ardent desire\r\n... to yield itself up to its cruel lust. But every non-satisfaction of\r\na ... deeply imprinted instinct has as its consequence pain and inner\r\ntorment. Now, we men are very much inclined to regard as naturally good\r\nand justifiable that which gives us decided pleasure, and conversely\r\nto reprobate, as bad and contrary to nature, that which produces\r\npain. Thus, it may happen that an intellectual and highly gifted\r\nman, born with perverted instincts, and feeling as torment ... the\r\nnon-satisfaction of the instinct, will hit upon the idea of justifying\r\nthe passion for murder, the extremest egoism ... as something good,\r\nbeautiful, and according to Nature, and to characterize as morbid\r\naberration the better opposing moral instincts, manifesting themselves\r\nin us as that which we call conscience.\r\n\r\nDr. Türck is right in admitting Nietzsche’s innate moral aberration\r\nand the inversion in him of healthy instincts. Nevertheless, in the\r\ninterpretation of the particular phenomena in which the aberration\r\nmanifests itself, he commits an error, which is explained by the\r\nfact that Dr. Türck is seemingly not deeply conversant with mental\r\ntherapeutics. He assumes that in Nietzsche’s mind the evil instincts\r\nare in severe conflict with those better notions instilled in him by\r\neducation, and that he experiences as pain the suppression of his\r\ninstincts by judgment. That is hardly the true state of the case.\r\nIt is not necessary that Nietzsche should have the wish to commit\r\nmurder and other crimes. Not every aberrant person (_pervers_) is\r\nsubject to impulsions. The perversion may be limited exclusively to\r\nthe sphere of ideation, and get its satisfaction wholly in ideas. A\r\nsubject thus affected never gets the notion of transforming his ideas\r\ninto deeds. His derangement does not encroach upon the centres of\r\nwill and movement, but carries on its fell work within the centres of\r\nideation. We know forms of sexual perversion in which the sufferers\r\nnever experience the impulse to seek satisfaction in acts, and who\r\nrevel only in thought.[410] This astonishing rupture of the natural\r\nconnection between idea and movement, between thought and act, this\r\ndetachment of the organs of will and movement from the organs of\r\nconception and judgment which they normally obey, is in itself a proof\r\nof deepest disorder throughout the machinery of thought. Incompetent\r\ncritics eagerly point to the fact that many authors and artists live\r\nunexceptionable lives in complete contrast to their works, which may\r\nbe immoral or contrary to nature, and deduce from this fact that it is\r\nunjustifiable to draw from his works conclusions as to the mental and\r\nmoral Nature of their author. Those who talk in this manner do not even\r\nsuspect that there are purely mental perversions which are quite as\r\nmuch a mental disease as the impulsions of the ‘impulsivists.’\r\n\r\nThis is obviously the case with Nietzsche. His perversion is of a\r\npurely intellectual character, and has hardly ever impelled him to\r\nacts. Hence, in his mind there has been no conflict between instincts\r\nand the morality acquired by education. His explanation of conscience\r\nhas quite another source than that assumed by Dr. Türck. It is one of\r\nthose perverted interpretations of a sensation by the consciousness\r\nperceiving it which are so frequently observed. Nietzsche remarks\r\nthat with him ideas of a cruel kind are accompanied by feelings\r\nof pleasure--that they are, as mental therapeutics expresses it,\r\n‘voluptuously accentuated.’ In consequence of this accompaniment of\r\npleasure he has the inclination to conjure up sensually sensuous\r\nrepresentations of that kind, and to dwell on them with enjoyment.[411]\r\nConsciousness then seeks to give some sort of rational explanation\r\nof these experiences by assuming cruelty to be a powerful primordial\r\ninstinct of man, that, since he may not actually commit cruel deeds, he\r\nmay, at least, take pleasure in the representation of them, and that\r\nthe rapturous lingering over representations of this kind, man calls\r\nhis conscience. As I have shown above, it is Nietzsche’s opinion that\r\nstings of conscience are not the consequence of evil deeds, but appear\r\nin men who have never committed any evil. Hence he obviously makes use\r\nof the word in a sense quite different from that of current usage, a\r\nsense peculiar to himself; he designates by it, simply his revelling in\r\nvoluptuously accentuated representations of cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe alienist, however, is familiar with the perversion in which the\r\ninvalid experiences voluptuous stimulation from acts or representations\r\nof a cruel nature. Science has a name for it. It is called Sadism.\r\nSadism is the opposite form of sexual perversion to masochism.[412]\r\nNietzsche is a sufferer from Sadism in its most pronounced form,\r\nonly with him it is confined to the intellectual sphere alone, and\r\nis satisfied by ideal debauchery. I do not wish to dwell too long\r\non this repulsive subject, and will, therefore, quote only a few\r\npassages, showing that, in Nietzsche’s thought, images of cruelty are\r\nwithout exception accompanied by ideas of a sensual character, and are\r\nitalicized by him: ‘The splendid beast ranging _in its lust_ after\r\nprey and victory’ (_Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p. 21). ‘The _feeling\r\nof content_ at being able, without scruple, to wreak his power on a\r\npowerless being, the _voluptuousness de faire le mal pour le plaisir\r\nde le faire_, the _enjoyment_ of vanquishing’ (_Ibid._, p. 51). ‘Do\r\nyour pleasure, ye wantons; roar for very _lust_ and wickedness’ (_Die\r\nfröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 226). ‘The path to one’s own heaven ever\r\nleads through the _voluptuousness_ of one’s own hell’ (_Ibid._, p.\r\n249). ‘How comes it that I have yet met no one ... who knew morality\r\nas a problem, and this problem as his personal distress, torment,\r\n_voluptuousness_, passion?’ (_Ibid._, p. 264). ‘Hitherto he has\r\nfelt most at ease on earth at the sight of tragedies, bull-fights,\r\nand crucifixions; and when he invented hell, behold, that was his\r\nheaven on earth. When the great man cries aloud, the little man runs\r\nswiftly thither, and his tongue hangs out from his throat for very\r\n_lusting_’ (_Also sprach Zarathustra_, pt. iii., p. 96), etc. I beg\r\nthe unprofessional reader particularly to observe the association\r\nof the words italicized with those expressing something evil. This\r\nassociation is neither accidental nor arbitrary. It is a psychical\r\nnecessity, for in Nietzsche’s consciousness no image of wickedness and\r\ncrime can arise without exciting him sexually, and he is unable to\r\nexperience any sexual stimulation without the immediate appearance in\r\nhis consciousness of an image of some deed of violence and blood.\r\n\r\nHence the real source of Nietzsche’s doctrine is his Sadism. And I will\r\nhere make a general remark on which I do not desire to linger, but\r\nwhich I should like to recommend to the particular attention of the\r\nreader. In the success of unhealthy tendencies in art and literature,\r\nno quality of their authors has so large and determining a share\r\nas their sexual psychopathy. All persons of unbalanced minds--the\r\nneurasthenic, the hysteric, the degenerate, the insane--have the\r\nkeenest scent for perversions of a sexual kind, and perceive them under\r\nall disguises. As a rule, indeed, they are ignorant of what it is in\r\ncertain works and artists which pleases them, but investigation always\r\nreveals in the object of their predilection a veiled manifestation\r\nof some _Psychopathia sexualis_. The masochism of Wagner and Ibsen,\r\nthe Skoptzism of Tolstoi, the erotomania (_folie amoureuse chaste_)\r\nof the Diabolists, the Decadents, and of Nietzsche, unquestionably\r\nobtain for these authors and tendencies a large, and, at all events,\r\nthe most sincere and fanatical fraction of their partisans. Works\r\nof a sexually psychopathic nature excite in abnormal subjects the\r\ncorresponding perversion (till then slumbering and unconscious,\r\nperhaps also undeveloped, although present in the germ), and give\r\nthem lively feelings of pleasure, which they, usually in good faith,\r\nregard as purely æsthetic or intellectual, whereas they are actually\r\nsexual. Only in the light of this explanation do the characteristic\r\nartistic tendencies of the abnormals, of which we have proof,[413]\r\nbecome wholly intelligible. This confounding of æsthetic with sexual\r\nfeelings is not surprising, for the spheres of these two feelings are\r\nnot only contiguous, but, as has been proved elsewhere, are for the\r\nmost part even coincident.[414] At the base of all oddities of costume,\r\nespecially that of women, there is hidden an unconscious speculation\r\nin something of a sexual-psychopathy, which finds incitation and\r\nattraction in the temporary fashion in dress. No professional person\r\nhas yet viewed fashions from this standpoint. I may not here allow\r\nmyself so broad a departure from my principal theme. The subject may,\r\nhowever, be most emphatically recommended to the consideration of\r\nexperts. In the domain of fashions they will make the most remarkable\r\npsychiatrical discoveries.\r\n\r\nI have devoted very much more space to the demonstration of the\r\nsenselessness of Nietzsche’s so-called philosophical system than\r\nthe man and his system deserve. It would have been enough simply to\r\nrefer to the all-sufficient and expressive fact that, after having\r\nbeen repeatedly confined in lunatic asylums, he has for some years\r\npast been living as incurably mad in the establishment of Professor\r\nBinswanger at Jena--‘the right man in the right place.’ It is true that\r\na critic is of the opinion that ‘it is possible for mental darkness to\r\nextinguish the clearest mental light; for this reason its appearance\r\ncannot with certitude be urged against the value and accuracy of what\r\nanyone has taught before the appearance of his affliction.’ The answer\r\nto this is that Nietzsche wrote his most important works between two\r\ndetentions in a lunatic asylum, and hence not ‘before,’ but ‘after, the\r\nappearance of his affliction,’ and that the whole question hinges on\r\nthe kind of mental disease appealed to as proof of the senselessness\r\nof any doctrine. It is clear that insanity caused by an accidental\r\nlesion of the brain, by a fall, blow, etc., can prove nothing against\r\nthe accuracy of that which the patient may have taught previous to\r\nhis accident. But the case is different when the malady is one which\r\nhas undoubtedly existed in a latent condition from birth, and can\r\nwith certainty be proved from the works themselves. Then it amply\r\nsuffices to establish the fact that the author is a Bedlamite, and his\r\nwork the daubing of a lunatic, and all further criticism, all efforts\r\nat rational refutation of individual inanities, become superfluous,\r\nand even--at least, in the eyes of those who are competent--a little\r\nridiculous. And this is the case with Nietzsche. He is obviously insane\r\nfrom birth, and his books bear on every page the imprint of insanity.\r\nIt may be cruel to insist on this fact.[415] It is, however, a painful,\r\nyet unavoidable, duty to refer to it anew, because Nietzsche has become\r\nthe means of raising a mental pestilence, and the only hope of checking\r\nits propagation lies in placing Nietzsche’s insanity in the clearest\r\nlight, and in branding his disciples also with the marks most suited to\r\nthem, viz., as hysterical and imbecile.\r\n\r\nKaatz[416] affirms that Nietzsche’s ‘intellectual seed’ is everywhere\r\n‘beginning to germinate. Now it is one of Nietzsche’s most incisive\r\npoints which is chosen as the epigraph of a modern tragedy, now one\r\nof his pregnant turns of expression incorporated in the established\r\nusage of language.... At the present time one can ... read hardly\r\nany essay touching even lightly on the province of philosophy,\r\nwithout meeting with the name of Nietzsche.’ Now, that is certainly\r\na calumnious exaggeration. Things are not quite so bad as that. The\r\nonly ‘philosophers’ who have hitherto taken Nietzsche’s insane drivel\r\nseriously are those whom I have above named the ‘fops’ of philosophy.\r\nBut the number of these ‘fops’ is, as a matter of fact, increasing in a\r\ndisquieting way, and their effrontery surpasses anything ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, unnecessary to say that Georges Brandès has numbered\r\nhimself among Nietzsche’s apostles. We know, indeed, that this\r\ningenious person winds himself around every human phenomenon in whom\r\nhe scents a possible primadonna, in order to draw from her profit for\r\nhimself as the impresario of her fame. He gave lectures in Copenhagen\r\non Nietzsche, ‘and declaimed in words of enthusiasm about this German\r\nprophet, for whom Mill’s morality is nothing but a diseased symptom\r\nof a degenerate age; this radical “aristocrat,” who degrades to the\r\nrank of slave-revolts all the great popular movements in history for\r\nfreedom--the Reformation, the French Revolution, modern socialism--and\r\ndares to assert that the millions on millions of individuals composing\r\nthe nations exist only for the purpose of producing, a few times in\r\neach century, a great personality.’[417]\r\n\r\nA series of imitators are eagerly busying themselves to make Nietzsche\r\ntheir model, whether in clearing the throat or in expectorating. His\r\ntreatise _Schopenhauer als Erzieher_ (_Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen,\r\n3 Stück_) has found a monstrous travesty in _Rembrandt als\r\nErzieher_. True, the imbecile author of the latter parody could\r\nnot imitate Nietzsche’s gushing redundancy of verbiage and the mad\r\nleaps of the maniac’s thought. This symptom of disease it were\r\nindeed hardly possible to simulate; but he has appropriated as his\r\nown the word-quibbling, the senseless echolalia of his model, and\r\nendeavours also stammeringly to imitate, as well as his small means\r\nallow, Nietzsche’s megalomaniacal and criminal individualism. Albert\r\nKniepf,[418] another imbecile, has been smitten chiefly by Nietzsche’s\r\naffected superiority, and with princely mien and gestures struts about\r\nin the most diverting manner. He calls himself ‘a man of superior taste\r\nand more refined feeling’; he speaks contemptuously of the ‘profane\r\ndaily bustle of the masses’; sees ‘the world beneath him’ and himself\r\n‘exalted above the world of the multitude’; he does not wish to ‘go\r\ninto the streets, and squander his wisdom on everyone,’ etc., quite\r\nin the style of Zarathustra, the dweller on the highest peaks. The\r\nalready mentioned Dr. Max Zerbst affects, like Nietzsche, to regard\r\nhimself as terrible, and to believe that his opponents tremble before\r\nhim. When he makes them speak he puts whimpering tones into their\r\nmouths,[419] and he enjoys with cruelly superior scorn the mortal fear\r\nwith which he inspires them. In a maniac this attitude is natural and\r\nexcites pity. But when a fellow like this Dr. Max Zerbst assumes it,\r\nit produces an irresistibly comic effect, and calls to remembrance\r\nthe young man with the weak legs in _Pickwick_, who ‘believes in\r\nblood alone,’ ‘will have blood.’ Zerbst dares to utter the words\r\n‘natural science’ and ‘psycho-physiology.’ That is an agreement among\r\nNietzsche’s disciples: they pass off the insane word-spouter whom they\r\nworship for a psycho-physiologist and a physicist! Ola Hansson speaks\r\nof Nietzsche’s ‘psycho-physiological intuition’! and in another place\r\nsays: ‘With Nietzsche, that modern subtle psychologist, who possesses\r\nin the highest degree psycho-physical intuition [again], that peculiar\r\npower of the end of the nineteenth century, of listening to and spying\r\nout all the secret processes and hidden corners in itself,’ etc.\r\n‘Psycho-physical intuition!’ ‘Listening to and spying out itself!’\r\nOur very eyes deceive us. These men, therefore, have no suspicion of\r\nwhat constitutes ‘psychophysics,’ they do not suspect that it is the\r\nexact contrary of ancient psychology, which dealt with ‘intuition’\r\nand introspection, _i.e._, ‘listening to one’s self’ and ‘spying out\r\none’s self’; that it patiently counts and mixes with the apparatus\r\nin laboratories, and ‘spies and listens to,’ not itself, but its\r\nexperimentists and instruments! And such babble of brainless parrots,\r\nwho chatter in repetition the words they accidentally hear, without\r\ncomprehending them, is able to make its way in Germany, the creator\r\nof the new science of psycho-physiology, the fatherland of Fechner,\r\nWeber, Wundt! And no professional has rapped with a ruler the knuckles\r\nof these youths, whose fabulous ignorance is surpassed only by their\r\nimpudence!\r\n\r\nBut worse still has befallen--something at which all jesting really\r\nceases. Kurt Eisner, who it is true does not agree with Nietzsche’s\r\n‘philosophy,’ is, nevertheless, of the opinion that he has ‘bequeathed\r\nus some powerful poems,’[420] and goes so far as to make use of this\r\nunheard-of expression: ‘Nietzsche’s _Zarathustra_ is a work of art\r\nlike _Faust_.’ The question first of all obtruding itself is: Has Kurt\r\nEisner at any time read a line of _Faust_? This, I take it, must be\r\nanswered in the affirmative, for it is hardly conceivable that at this\r\ntime of day there is in Germany any adult, seemingly able to read and\r\nwrite, into whose hands _Faust_ has not fallen at some time or other.\r\nThen there remains only one other question: What may Kurt Eisner\r\nhave understood of _Faust_? To name in the same breath the senseless\r\nspirting jet of words of a _Zarathustra_ with _Faust_ is such a\r\ndefilement of our most precious poetical treasure that verily if a man\r\nof any greater importance than Kurt Eisner had perpetrated it there had\r\nbeen need of an expiatory festival to atone for the insult to Goethe,\r\neven as the Church newly consecrates a place of worship when it has\r\nbeen profaned by a sacrilegious act.\r\n\r\nNot only in Germany is the Nietzsche gang working mischief; it is also\r\ninfesting other lands. Ola Hansson,[421] already mentioned, entertains\r\nhis Swedish fellow-countrymen most enthusiastically with ‘Nietzsche’s\r\nPoetry’ and ‘Nietzsche’s Midnight Hymn’; T. de Wysewa[422] assures\r\nthe French, who are not in the position to prove the accuracy of his\r\nassertions, that ‘Nietzsche is the greatest thinker and most brilliant\r\nauthor produced by Germany in the last generation,’ etc.\r\n\r\nIt has, nevertheless, been reserved to a lady to beat the male\r\ndisciples of Nietzsche, in the audacious denial of the most openly\r\nmanifest truth. This feminine partisan of Nietzsche, Lou Salomé, with a\r\ncool imperturbability fit to take away the breath of the most callous\r\nspectator, turns her back on the fact that Nietzsche has for years\r\nbeen confined in a lunatic asylum, and proclaims with brazen brow that\r\nNietzsche, from the aristocratic contempt of the world belonging to the\r\n‘over-human,’ has voluntarily ceased to write, and withdrawn himself\r\ninto solitude. Nietzsche is a man of science and a psycho-physiologist,\r\nand Nietzsche keeps silence, because he no longer finds it worth the\r\ntrouble to speak to the men of the herd; these are the catch-words\r\ncried aloud throughout the world by the Nietzsche band. In the face\r\nof such a conspiracy against truth, honesty, sound reason, it is not\r\nenough to have proved the senselessness of Nietzsche’s system, it\r\nmust also be shown that Nietzsche has always been insane, and that\r\nhis writings are the abortions of frenzy (more exactly, of ‘maniacal\r\nexaltation’).\r\n\r\nA few followers of Nietzsche, undoubtedly not fit to hold a candle to\r\nLou Salomé, do not contest the fact of Nietzsche’s insanity, but say\r\nthat he became insane because he withdrew himself too much from men,\r\nbecause he lived too long in the deepest solitude, because his speed\r\nof thought was so ruinously, unnaturally rapid. This unheard-of idiocy\r\ncould circulate throughout the entire German press, and yet not a\r\nsingle newspaper had the gumption to remark that insanity can never be\r\nthe consequence of solitude and too speedy thought, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, a propensity for solitude and vertiginously rapid thought are\r\nthe primary and best known signs of existing insanity, and that this\r\nprattle of Nietzsche’s partisans is, perhaps, of equal force with the\r\nassertion that someone had contracted lung disease through coughing and\r\nhæmorrhage!\r\n\r\nFor Nietzsche’s ‘anthropophobia’ we have the evidence of his\r\nbiographers, who cite curious examples of it.[423] His rapid thought,\r\nhowever, is a phenomenon never absent in frenzied madness. That the\r\nunprofessional reader may know what he is to understand by this, we\r\nwill present him with the clinical picture of this form of insanity\r\ntraced by the hand of the most authoritative masters.\r\n\r\n‘The acceleration of the course of thought in mania,’ says Griesinger,\r\n‘is a consequence of the facilitation of the connection between\r\nrepresentations, where the patient humbugs, romances, declaims, sings,\r\ncalls into service all the modes of exteriorizing ideas, rambles\r\nincoherently from one topic to another, the ideas hurtling against and\r\noverthrowing each other. The same acceleration of ideation is found\r\nin certain forms of dementia and in secondary psychical enfeeblement,\r\n“with activity produced by hallucinations.” The logical concatenations\r\nare not in this case intact, as in argumentation and hypochondriacal\r\ndementia; or the precipitate sequence of representations no longer\r\nfollows any law; or, again, only words and sounds devoid of meaning\r\nsucceed each other with impetuous haste.... Thus there arises ... a\r\nceaseless chase of ideas, in the torrent of which all is borne away\r\nin pell-mell flight. The latter conditions appear chiefly in raving\r\nmadness; at its inception especially, a greater mental vivacity often\r\nmanifests itself, and cases have been observed where the fact that the\r\npatient became witty was a sure sign of the imminence of an attack of\r\nfrenzy.’[424]\r\n\r\nStill more graphic is the description given by Krafft-Ebing.[425] ‘The\r\ncontent of consciousness is here [in ‘maniacal exaltation’] pleasure,\r\npsychical well-being. It is just as little induced by events of the\r\nexternal world as the opposite state of psychical pain in melancholia,\r\nand is, therefore, referable to an inner organic cause only. The\r\npatient literally revels in feelings of pleasure, and declares, after\r\nrecovery, that never, when in good health, has he felt so contented,\r\nso buoyant, so happy, as during his illness. This spontaneous pleasure\r\nundergoes powerful increments ... through the perception by the patient\r\nof the facilitated processes of ideation ... through the intensive\r\naccentuation of ideas by feelings of pleasure and by agreeable\r\ncœnæstheses, especially in the domain of muscular sensation.... In\r\nthis way the cheerful mood temporarily exalts itself to the height of\r\npleasurable emotions (gay extravagance, exuberance), which find their\r\nmotor exteriorization in songs, dances, leaps.... The patient becomes\r\nmore plastic in his diction ... his faculties of conception act more\r\nrapidly, and, in accelerated association, he is at once more prompt in\r\nrepartee, witty and humorous to the point of irony. The plethora of\r\nhis consciousness supplies him with inexhaustible material for talk,\r\nand the enormous acceleration of his ideation, in which there spring\r\nup complete intermediate forms with the rapidity of thought, without\r\nundergoing exteriorization in speech, causes his current of ideas, in\r\nso far as they find expression, to seem rambling.... He continually\r\nexercises criticism in respect of his own condition, and proves that\r\nhe is himself aware of his abnormal state by ... claiming, among\r\nother things, that he is only a fool, and that to such everything is\r\npermissible.... The invalid cannot find words enough to depict his\r\nmaniacal well-being, his “primordial health.”’\r\n\r\nAnd now every individual feature of this picture of disease shall be\r\npointed out in Nietzsche’s writings. (I repeat my previous remark, that\r\nI am compelled to limit myself in citing examples, but that literally\r\non every page of Nietzsche’s writing examples of the same kind are to\r\nbe found.)\r\n\r\nHis cœnæstheses, or systemic sensations, continually inspire him\r\nwith presentations of laughter, dancing, flying, buoyancy, generally\r\nof movement of the gayest and easiest kind--of rolling, flowing,\r\nplunging. ‘Let us guard ourselves from immediately making gloomy faces\r\nat the word “torture” ... even there something remains for laughter.’\r\n‘We are prepared for a carnival in the grand style, for the most\r\nspiritual carnival-laughter and exuberance, for the transcendental\r\nheight of the most exalted idiocy and Aristophanic derision of the\r\nuniverse.... Perhaps if nothing else of to-day has a future, our very\r\nlaughter still has a future.’ ‘I would even permit myself to classify\r\nphilosophers according to the quality of their laughter--up to those\r\ncapable of golden laughter[!] ... The gods are jocular. It seems as\r\nif, even in sacred deeds, they could not forbear laughing.’ ‘Ah! what\r\nare ye then, ye written and painted thoughts of mine? It is not long\r\nsince ye were so fantastic, so young and naughty ... that ye made me\r\nsneeze and laugh.’ ‘Now the world laughs, the dismal veil is rent.’\r\n‘It is laughter that kills, not wrath. Come, let us kill the spirit of\r\nheaviness!’ ‘Truly there are beings chaste by nature; they are milder\r\nin heart; they laugh more agreeably and copiously than ye. They laugh\r\nas well over chastity, and ask, What is chastity?’ ‘Had He [Jesus\r\nChrist] remained in the desert, perhaps He would have learned to live\r\nand to love the earth--and to laugh besides.’ ‘The tension of my cloud\r\nwas too great; between the laughters of the lightnings I will cast\r\nhail-showers into the deep.’ ‘To-day my shield quivered gently and\r\nlaughed at me; that is the holy laughter and tremor of beauty.’\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in all these cases the idea of laughter has\r\nno logical connection with the real thought; it is far rather an\r\naccompaniment of his intellection as a basic state, as a chronic\r\nobsession, having its explanation in the maniacal excitation of the\r\ncentres of ideation. It is the same with the presentations of dancing,\r\nflying, etc. ‘I should only believe in a god who knew how to dance.’\r\n‘Truly, Zarathustra is no hurricane and whirlwind; and if he is a\r\ndancer, yet is he by no means a dancer of the tarantella.’ ‘And once\r\nupon a time I wished to dance, as I never yet have danced; away over\r\nthe whole heaven did I wish to dance.... Only in the dance do I know\r\nof parables for the highest things.’ ‘I found this blessed security in\r\nall things also: that on the feet of chance they preferred--to dance. O\r\nthou heaven above me, O pure! O sublime! thy purity is now for me ...\r\nthat thou art a dancing-floor for divine chances.’ ‘Ask of my foot ...\r\ntruly after such a rhythm, such a tick-tack, it likes neither to dance\r\nnor rest.’ ‘And, above all, I learned to stand and walk and run and\r\nleap and climb and dance.’ ‘It is a fine fool’s jest this, of speech;\r\nthanks to it, man dances over all things.’ ‘O my soul, I taught thee\r\nto say “to-day,” as well as “once” and “formerly,” and to dance thy\r\nmeasure over all the “here” and “there” and “yonder.” Thou castest thy\r\nglance at my foot crazy for the dance.’ ‘If my virtue is a dancer’s\r\nvirtue, and I often bounded with both feet into a rapture of golden\r\nemerald,’ etc.\r\n\r\n(‘A state of mind he experienced with horror:’) ‘A perpetual movement\r\nbetween high and deep, and the feeling of high and deep, a constant\r\nfeeling as if mounting steps, and at the same moment as if reposing on\r\nclouds.’ ‘Is there, indeed, one thing alone that remains uncomprehended\r\nby it ... that only in flight is it touched, beheld, lightened\r\nupon?’ ‘All my will would fly alone, would fly into thee.’ ‘Ready\r\nand impatient to fly, to fly away; that is now my nature.’ ‘My wise\r\nlonging cried out from me, and laughed also ... my great longing, with\r\nrushing wings. And often it dragged me forth, and away in the midst of\r\nmy laughter; then, indeed, I flew shuddering ... thither, where gods\r\ndance, ashamed of all clothes.’ ‘If I ever spread still heavens above\r\nme, and with my own wings flew in my own heavens.... If my malice is a\r\nlaughing malice ... and if my Alpha and Omega is that all heaviness may\r\nbecome light, all body a dancer, all spirit a bird; and verily that is\r\nmy Alpha and Omega,’ etc.\r\n\r\nIn the examples hitherto cited the insane ideas are mainly in the\r\nsphere of movement. In those that follow it is excitations of the\r\nsensorial centres that find expression. Nietzsche has all sorts of\r\nillusions of skin-sensibility (cold, warmth, being breathed upon), of\r\nsight (lustre, lightning, brightness), of hearing (rushing, roaring),\r\nand of smell, which he mixes up in his fugitive ideation. ‘I am too\r\nhot and burnt with my own thoughts.’ ‘Ah! ice surrounds me; my hand\r\nis burnt by iciness.’ ‘The sun of my love lay brooding upon me;\r\nZarasthustra was stewing in his own juice.’ ‘Take care that there be\r\nhoney ready to my hand ... good, icy-fresh, golden honeycomb.’ ‘Into\r\nthe coldest water I plunged with head and heart.’ ‘There I am sitting\r\n... lusting for a maiden’s round mouth, but still more for maidenly,\r\nicy-cold, snow-white, cutting, biting teeth.’ ‘For I deal with deep\r\nproblems as with a cold bath--soon into it, soon out of it.... Ho! the\r\ngreat cold quickens.’ ‘Over thy surging sea I blew with the storm that\r\nis called spirit; I blew from it all clouds.’ ‘To their bodies and to\r\ntheir spirits our happiness would be as ice-caverns! and, like strong\r\nwinds, we will live above them ... and like a wind will I once blow\r\namong them.’\r\n\r\n‘I am light ... but this is my loneliness, that I am engirdled with\r\nlight.... I live in my own light; I drink back into myself the flames\r\nthat break forth from me.’\r\n\r\n‘Mute over the roaring sea art thou this day arisen for me.’ ‘They\r\ndivine nothing from the roaring of my happiness.’ ‘Sing, and riot in\r\nroaring, O Zarathustra!’ ‘Almost too fiercely for me thou dost gush\r\nforth, well-spring of joy ... too violently doth my heart gush forth to\r\nmeet thee.’ ‘My desire now breaks forth from me like a fountain.’\r\n\r\n‘There is often an odour in her wisdom, as if it came forth from a\r\nswamp.’ ‘Alas! that I should have so long lived in the midst of their\r\nnoise and foul breath. O blessed stillness around me!’ ‘O pure odours\r\naround me!’ ‘That was the falsehood in my pity, that in each I saw and\r\nsmelt what was mind enough for him.... With blissful nostrils again I\r\nbreathed the freedom of the mountain! My nose is at length redeemed\r\nfrom the odour of all that is human!’ ‘Bad air! bad air!... Why must I\r\nsmell the entrails of a misguided soul?’ ‘This workshop, where ideals\r\nare manufactured, meseems it stinks of nothing but lies.’ ‘We avoided\r\nthe rabble ... the stink of shopkeepers ... the foul breath.’ ‘This\r\nrabble, that stinks to heaven.’ ‘O odours pure around me!... These\r\ncrowds of superior men--perhaps they do not smell nice,’ etc.\r\n\r\nAs these examples show, Nietzsche’s thought receives its special\r\ncolouring from his sense illusions, and from the excitation of the\r\ncentres forming motor presentations, which, in consequence of a\r\nderangement of the mechanism of co-ordination, are not transformed into\r\nmotor impulses, but remain as mere images, without influence on the\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nIn respect of form, Nietzsche’s thought makes the two characteristic\r\npeculiarities of madness perceptible: the sole domination of the\r\nassociation of ideas, watched over and restrained by no attention, no\r\nlogic, no judgment; and the giddy rapidity of the course of ideation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any idea whatsoever springs up in Nietzsche’s mind, it\r\nimmediately draws with it into consciousness all presentations related\r\nto it, and thus with flying hand he throws five, six, often eight,\r\nsynonyms on paper, without noticing how overladen and turgid his\r\nliterary style is thereby rendered: ‘The force of a mind measures\r\nitself ... by the degree to which it is obliged to attenuate, veil,\r\nsweeten, damp, falsify the truth.’ ‘We are of the opinion that\r\nseverity, violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart,\r\nconcealment, stoicism, the tempter’s art and devilry of every kind;\r\nthat all things wicked, fearful, tyrannical, bestial, and serpent-like\r\nin man, are of as much service in the elevation of the species “man”\r\nas their opposites. He knows ... on what miserable things the loftiest\r\nBecoming has hitherto been shattered, snapped off, has fallen away,\r\nbecome miserable.’ ‘In man there is material, fragment, surplus, clay,\r\nmud, nonsense, chaos; but in man there is also creator, constructor,\r\nhammer-hardness, divinity-of-the-beholder, and the seventh day....\r\nThat which for this one must be formed, broken, forged, torn,\r\nburnt, made red-hot, purified.’ ‘It would sound more courteous if\r\n... an unrestrained honesty were related, whispered, and praised\r\n(_nachsagte_, _nachraunte_, _nachrühmte_) of us.’ ‘Spit upon the\r\ntown ... where swarms all that is rotten, tainted, lustful, gloomy,\r\nworm-eaten, ulcerous, seditious.’ ‘We forebode that it is ever growing\r\ndownwards into the more attenuated, more debonnaire, more artful,\r\nmore easy-going, more mediocre, more indifferent, more Chinese, more\r\nChristian.’ ‘All these pallid Atheists, Anti-Christians, Immoralists,\r\nNihilists, Sceptics, Ephectics, Hectics of the mind,’ etc.\r\n\r\nFrom these examples, the attentive reader must have already remarked\r\nthat the tumultuous rush of words frequently results from the merest\r\nresemblance in sound. Not seldom does the riot of words degenerate\r\ninto paltry quibbling, into the silliest pun, into the automatic\r\nassociation of words according to their sound, without regard to\r\ntheir meaning. ‘If this turn (_Wende_) in all the need (_Noth_) is\r\ncalled necessity (_Nothwendigkeit_).’ ‘Thus ye boast (_brüstet_) of\r\nyourselves--alas! even without breasts (_Brüste_).’ ‘There is much\r\npious lick-spittle-work (_Speichel-Leckerie_), baking-of-flattery\r\n(_Schmeichel-Bäckerei_) before the Lord of Hosts.’ ‘Spit upon the\r\ngreat town, which is the great slum (_Abraum_), where all the scum\r\n(_Abschaum_) froths together (_zusammanschäumt_).’ ‘Here and there\r\nthere is nothing to better (_bessern_), nothing to worsen (_bösern_).’\r\n‘What have they to do there, far-seeing (weitsichtige), far-seeking\r\n(_weit-süchtige_) eyes?’ ‘In such processions (_Zügen_) goats\r\n(_Ziegen_) and geese, and the strong-headed and the wrong-headed\r\n(_Kreuz und Querköpfe_), were always running on before.... O,\r\nWill, turn of all need (_Wende aller Noth_)! O thou my necessity\r\n(_Nothwendigkeit_)!’ ‘Thus I look afar over the creeping and swarming\r\nof little gray waves (_Wellen_) and wills (_Willen_).’ ‘This seeking\r\n(_Suchen_) for my home was the visitation (_Heimsuchung_) of me.’\r\n‘Did not the world become perfect, round and ripe (_reif_)? O for the\r\ngolden round ring (_Reif_)!’ ‘Yawns (_Klafft_) the abyss here too?\r\nYelps (_Kläfft_) the dog of hell here too?’ ‘It stultifies, brutalizes\r\n(_verthiert_), and transforms into a bull (_verstiert_).’ ‘Life is at\r\nleast (_mindestens_), at the mildest (_mildestens_), an exploiting.’\r\n‘Whom I deemed transformed akin to myself (_verwandt-verwandelt_),’ etc.\r\n\r\nNietzsche, in the wild hurry of his thought, many a time fails to\r\ncomprehend the scintillating word-images elaborated in his centres of\r\nspeech; his consciousness, as it were, hears wrongly, misses its aim in\r\ninterpreting, and invents wondrous neologisms, which sound like known\r\nexpressions, but have no sort of fellowship in meaning with these. He\r\nspeaks, for example, of _Hinterweltlern_ (inhabitants of remote worlds)\r\nfrom _Hinterwäldlern_ (backwoodsmen), of a _Kesselbauche_ (kettle’s\r\nbelly) when he is thinking of _Kesselpauche_ (kettledrum), etc.; or he\r\neven repeats, as his centres of speech prompt, wholly incomprehensible,\r\nmeaningless sounds. ‘Then I went to the door: Alpa! I cried, who is\r\ncarrying his ashes to the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! who is carrying his\r\nashes to the mountain?’\r\n\r\nHe frequently associates his ideas, not according to the sound of the\r\nword, but according to the similarity or habitual contiguity of the\r\nconcepts; then there arise ‘analogous’ intellection and the fugitive\r\nideation, in which, to use Griesinger’s expression, he ‘rambles\r\nincoherently from one topic to another.’ Speaking of the ‘ascetic\r\nideal,’ _e.g._, he elaborates the idea that strong and noble spirits\r\ntake refuge in the desert, and, without any connection, adds: ‘Of\r\ncourse, too, they would not want for camels there.’ The representation\r\nof the desert has irresistibly drawn after it the representation\r\nof camels, habitually associated with it. At another time he says:\r\n‘Beasts of prey and men of prey, _e.g._, Cæsar Borgia, are radically\r\nmisunderstood; Nature is misunderstood so long as a fundamental\r\ndiseased condition is sought for in these healthiest of all tropical\r\nmonsters and growths. It seems that there is among moralists a hatred\r\nagainst the primeval forest and against the tropics, and that the\r\ntropical man must, at any price, be discredited. But why? For the\r\nbenefit of the temperate zone? For the benefit of the temperate\r\n(moderate) men? Of the mediocre?’ In this case the contemplation of\r\nCæsar Borgia forces upon him the comparison with a beast of prey; this\r\nmakes him think of the tropics, the torrid zone; from the torrid zone\r\nhe comes to the temperate zone, from this to the ‘temperate’ man, and,\r\nthrough the similarity of sound, to the ‘mediocre’ man (in German,\r\n_gemässigt_ and _mittelmässig_).\r\n\r\n‘In truth nothing remains of the world but green twilight and green\r\nlightnings. Do as it pleases ye, ye wantons ... shake your emeralds\r\ndown into the deepest depth.’ The quite incomprehensible ‘emeralds’\r\nare called up into consciousness by the representation of the ‘green’\r\ntwilight and lightnings.\r\n\r\nIn this and hundreds of other cases the course of ideation can, to a\r\ncertain extent, be followed, because all the links in the chain of\r\nassociation are preserved. It often happens, however, that some of\r\nthese links are suppressed, and then there occur leaps of thought,\r\nincomprehensible, and, consequently, bewildering to the reader: ‘It\r\nwas the body who despaired of the earth, who heard the belly of being\r\nspeaking to itself.’ ‘More honestly and more purely speaks the healthy\r\nbody, the perfect and rectangular.’ ‘I am polite towards them as\r\ntowards all petty vexation; to be prickly against pettiness seems to\r\nme wisdom for hedgehogs.’ ‘Deep yellow and hot red; so would my taste\r\nhave it. This one mixes blood in all colours. He who whitewashes his\r\nhouse betrays to me his whitewashed soul.’ ‘We placed our seat in the\r\nmidst--so their smirking tells me--and as far from dying gladiators as\r\nfrom contented pigs. But this is mediocrity.’ ‘Our Europe of to-day is\r\n... sceptic ... at one time with that mobile scepticism which leaps\r\nimpatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, at another gloomy as\r\na cloud overladen with notes of interrogation.’ ‘Let us grant that he\r\n[the ‘courageous thinker’] has long enough hardened and pricked up his\r\neye for himself.’ (Here the representation of ‘ear’ and ‘pricked-up\r\nears’ has evidently crossed with confusing effect the associated idea\r\nof ‘eye.’) ‘It is already too much for me to keep my opinions to\r\nmyself, and many a bird flies away. And sometimes I find flown into my\r\ndovecot an animal that is strange to me, and that trembles when I lay\r\nmy hand on it.’ ‘What matters my justice? I do not see that I should\r\nbe fire and coal.’ ‘They learned from the sea its vanity, too; is the\r\nsea not the peacock of peacocks?’ ‘How many things now go by the name\r\nof the greatest wickedness, which are only twelve feet wide and three\r\nmonths long! But greater dragons will one day come into the world.’\r\n‘And if all ladders now fail thee, then must thou understand how to\r\nmount on thine own head; how wouldst thou mount otherwise?’ ‘Here I\r\nsit, sniffing the best air, the very air of Paradise, luminous, light\r\nair, rayed with gold; as good an air as ever yet fell from the moon.’\r\n‘Ha! up dignity! Virtue’s dignity! European dignity! Blow, blow again,\r\nbellows of virtue! Ha! roar once more, morally roar! As a moral lion\r\nroar before the daughters of the desert! For virtue’s howl, ye dearest\r\nmaidens, is more than all European fervour, European voraciousness! And\r\nhere am I, already a European; I cannot otherwise, God help me! Amen!\r\nThe desert grows, woe to him who hides deserts!’\r\n\r\nThe last passage is an example of complete fugitive ideation. Nietzsche\r\noften loses the clue, no longer knows what he is driving at, and\r\nfinishes a sentence which began as if to develop into an argument, with\r\na sudden stray jest. ‘Why should the world, which somewhat concerns\r\nus, not be a fiction? And to him who objects: “But a fiction must have\r\nan author,” could not the reply be roundly given: Why? Does not this\r\n“must” perhaps belong also to the fiction? Is it not permissible to be\r\nat last a little ironical towards the subject as well as towards the\r\npredicate and object? Ought not the philosopher to rise above a belief\r\nin grammar? With all respect for governesses [!], is it not time that\r\nphilosophy should renounce its faith in governesses?’ ‘“One is always\r\ntoo many about me,” so thinks the hermit. One times one to infinity at\r\nlast makes two!’ ‘What, then, do they call that which makes them proud?\r\nThey name it culture; it distinguishes them from the goat-herds.’\r\n\r\nFinally, the connection of the associated representations suddenly\r\nsnaps, and he breaks off in the midst of a sentence to begin a new one:\r\n‘For in religion the passions have once more rights of citizenship,\r\nprovided that.’ ‘The psychologists of France ... have not yet\r\nenjoyed to the full their bitter and manifold pleasure in _la bêtise\r\nbourgeoise_, in a manner as if--enough; they betray something thereby.’\r\n‘There have been philosophers who knew how to lend yet another\r\nseductive ... expression to this admiration of the people ... instead\r\nof adducing the naked and thoroughly obvious truth, that disinterested\r\nconduct is very interesting and interested conduct, provided that----\r\nAnd love?’\r\n\r\nThis is the form of Nietzsche’s intellection, sufficiently explaining\r\nwhy he has never set down three coherent pages, but only more or less\r\nshort ‘aphorisms.’\r\n\r\nThe content of this incoherent fugitive ideation is formed by a\r\nsmall number of insane ideas, continually repeating themselves\r\nwith exasperating monotony. We have already become acquainted with\r\nNietzsche’s intellectual Sadism, and his mania of contradiction and\r\ndoubt, or mania for questioning. In addition to these he evinces\r\nmisanthropy, or anthropophobia, megalomania, and mysticism.\r\n\r\nHis anthropophobia expresses itself in numberless passages: ‘Knowledge\r\nis no longer sufficiently loved as soon as it is communicated.’ ‘Every\r\ncommunity leads somehow, somewhen, somewhere--to vulgarity.’ ‘There\r\nare still many void places for the lonesome and twosome [!] around\r\nwhich wafts the odour of tranquil seas.’ ‘Flee, my friend, into thy\r\nlonesomeness!’ ‘And many a one who turned away from life, only turned\r\naway from the rabble ... and many a one who went into the desert and\r\nsuffered thirst with the beasts of prey, only wished not to sit with\r\nfilthy camel-drivers about the tank.’\r\n\r\nHis megalomania appears only exceptionally as monstrous self-conceit;\r\nbut it is, nevertheless, clearly conceivable; as a rule it displays a\r\nstrong and even predominant union of mysticism and supernaturalism.\r\nIt is pure self-conceit when he says: ‘In that which concerns my\r\n“Zarathustra,” I accept no one as a connoisseur whom each of his\r\nwords has not at some time deeply wounded and deeply enraptured; only\r\nthen can he enjoy the privilege of reverentially participating in\r\nthe halcyon element out of which every work is born, in its sunny\r\nbrightness, distance, breadth, and certainty.’ Or when, after having\r\ncriticised and belittled Bismarck, he cries, with transparent allusion\r\nto himself: ‘But I, in my happiness and my “beyond,” pondered how soon\r\nthe stronger becomes master of the strong.’ On the other hand, the\r\nhidden, mystic, primary idea of his megalomania already distinctly\r\ncomes out in this passage: ‘But at some given time ... must he\r\nnevertheless come, the redeeming man of great love and contempt, the\r\ncreative spirit who his impulsive strength is ever driving away out of\r\nall that is apart and beyond, whose loneliness is misunderstood by the\r\npeople as if it were flight from reality. It is only his immersion,\r\ninterment, absorption [three synonyms for one concept!] into reality,\r\nin order that at some time if he again comes into the light, he may\r\nbring home the redemption of this reality.’\r\n\r\nThe nature of his megalomania is betrayed by the expressions ‘redeeming\r\nman’ and ‘redemption.’ He imagines himself a new Saviour, and\r\nplagiarizes the Gospel in form and substance. _Also Sprach Zarathustra_\r\nis a complete stereotype of the sacred writings of Oriental nations.\r\nThe book aims at an external resemblance to the Bible and Koran. It\r\nis divided into chapters and verses; the language is the archaic and\r\nprophetic language of the books of Revelation (‘And Zarathustra looked\r\nat the people, and was astonished. Then he spake and said thus:’);\r\nthere frequently appear long enumerations and sermons like litanies\r\n(‘I love those who do not seek a reason only behind the stars ...; I\r\nlove him who lives to know ...; I love him who labours and invents\r\n...; I love him who loves his virtue ...; I love him who withholds\r\nfor himself not one drop of mind,’ etc.), and individual paragraphs\r\npoint _verbatim_ to analogous portions of the Gospel, _e.g._: ‘When\r\nZarathustra had taken leave of the city ... there followed him many\r\nwho called themselves his disciples and bore him company. Thus they\r\ncame to a cross-road; then said Zarathustra unto them, that thenceforth\r\nhe would go alone.’ ‘And the happiness of the spirit is this: to\r\nbe anointed by tears and consecrated as a beast of sacrifice.’\r\n‘Verily, said he to his disciples, yet a little and there comes this\r\nlong twilight. Ah! how shall I save my light?’ ‘In this manner did\r\nZarathustra go about, sore at heart, and for three days took no food\r\nor drink.... At length it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep.\r\nAnd his disciples sat around him in long night-watches,’ etc. Many\r\nof the chapters have most expressive titles: ‘On Self-Conquest;’ ‘On\r\nImmaculate Knowledge;’ ‘On Great Events;’ ‘On the Redemption;’ ‘On the\r\nMount of Olives;’ ‘On Apostates;’ ‘The Cry of Sore Need;’ ‘The Last\r\nSupper;’ ‘The Awakening,’ etc. Sometimes, it is true, it befalls him\r\nto say, atheistically: ‘If there were gods, how could I endure to be\r\nno god? _Hence_’ (italics his) ‘there are no gods;’ but such passages\r\nvanish among the countless ones in which he refers to himself as a god.\r\n‘Thou hast the power and thou wilt not reign.’ ‘He who is of my nature\r\nescapes not such an hour--the hour which says to him: Only now art thou\r\ngoing the way of thy greatness.... Thou art entering on the way of thy\r\ngreatness; that which has hitherto been thy last danger has now become\r\nthy last resource. Thou art entering on the way of thy greatness; now\r\nmust thy best courage be, that there is no longer any way behind thee.\r\nThou art going on the way of thy greatness; here shall no one slink\r\nbehind thee,’ etc.\r\n\r\nNietzsche’s mysticism and megalomania manifest themselves not only in\r\nhis somewhat more coherent thought, but also in his general mode of\r\nexpression. The mystic numbers, three and seven, frequently appear. He\r\nsees the external world, as he does himself--vast, distant, deep; and\r\nthe words expressing these concepts are repeated on every page, almost\r\nin every line: ‘The discipline of suffering, of great suffering....’\r\n‘The South is a great school of healing.’ ‘These last great\r\nsearchers....’ ‘With the signs of great destiny.’ ‘Where together with\r\ngreat compassion he has learnt great contempt--to learn, at their side,\r\ngreat reverence.’ ‘Guilt is all great existence.’ ‘That I may celebrate\r\nthe great noon with you.’ ‘Thus speaks all great love.’ ‘Not from you\r\nis great weariness to come to me.’ ‘Men who are nothing but a great\r\neye, or a great mouth, or a great belly, or something great....’ ‘To\r\nlove with great love, to love with great contempt.’ ‘But thou, O depth,\r\nthou sufferest too deeply.’ ‘Immovable is my depth, but it gleams with\r\nfloating enigmas and laughters.’ (It is to be observed how, in this\r\nsentence, all the obsessions of the maniac crowd together--depth,\r\nbrilliancy, mania of doubt, hilarious excitation.) ‘All depth shall\r\nascend to my height.’ ‘They do not think enough into the deep,’ etc.\r\nWith the idea of depth is connected that of abyss, which recurs with\r\nequal constancy. The words ‘abyss’ and ‘abysmal’ are among the most\r\nfrequent in Nietzsche’s writings. His words which have the prefix\r\n‘over’ are associated with his motor images, especially those of flying\r\nand hovering: ‘Over-moral sense’; ‘over-European music’; ‘climbing\r\nmonkeys and over-heated’; ‘from the species to the over-species’; ‘the\r\nover-hero’; ‘the over-human’; ‘the over-dragon’; ‘the over-urgent’ and\r\n‘over-compassionate,’ etc.\r\n\r\nAs is general in frenzied madness, Nietzsche is conscious of his\r\ndiseased interior processes, and in countless places alludes to the\r\nfuriously rapid outflow of his ideation and to his insanity: ‘That\r\ntrue philosophic reunion of a bold, unrestrained mentality, running\r\n_presto_.... They regard thought as something slow, hesitant, almost a\r\ntoil; not at all as something light, divine, and nearest of kin to the\r\ndance, to exuberance.’ ‘The bold, light, tender march and flight of his\r\nthought.’ ‘We think too rapidly.... It is as if we carried about in our\r\nhead an incessantly rolling machine.’ ‘It is in impatient spirits that\r\nthere breaks out a veritable pleasure in insanity, because insanity\r\nhas so joyous a _tempo_.’ ‘All talking runs too slowly for me; I leap\r\ninto thy chariot, Storm!... Like a cry and a huzza would I glide away\r\nover vast seas.’ ‘Eruptive insanity forever hovers above humanity as\r\nits greatest danger.’ (He is, of course, thinking of himself when\r\nspeaking of ‘humanity.’) ‘In these days it sometimes happens that a\r\ngentle, temperate, self-contained man becomes suddenly frenzied, breaks\r\nplates, upsets the table, shrieks, rages, offends everyone, and finally\r\nretires in shame and anger against himself.’ (Most decidedly ‘that\r\nsometimes happens,’ not only ‘in these days,’ but in all times; but\r\namong maniacs only.) ‘Where is the insanity with which ye were forced\r\nto be inoculated? Behold, I teach you the over-man, who is ... this\r\ninsanity.’ ‘All things are worth the same; each is alike. He who feels\r\notherwise goes voluntarily [?] into a madhouse.’ ‘I put this exuberance\r\nand this foolishness in the place of that will, as I taught; in all\r\none thing is impossible--reasonableness.’ ‘My hand is a fool’s hand;\r\nwoe to all tables and walls, and wherever there is yet room for the\r\nembellishments of fools--scribbling of fools!’ (In the original there\r\nis here a play on the words _Zierrath_, _Schmierrath_.)[426] He also,\r\nin the manner of maniacs, excuses his mental disease: ‘Finally, there\r\nwould remain open the great question whether we could dispense with\r\ndisease even for the development of our virtue, and especially if our\r\nthirst for knowledge and self-knowledge needed the sick soul as much as\r\nthe healthy soul.’\r\n\r\nFinally, he is not even wanting in the maniacal idea of his ‘primæval\r\nhealth.’ His soul is ‘always clearer and always healthier’; ‘we\r\nArgonauts of the ideal’ are ‘healthier than one would fain allow us to\r\nbe--dangerously healthy, more and more healthy,’ etc.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a necessarily condensed summary of the special colour,\r\nform, and content of Nietzsche’s thought, originating in illusions\r\nof sense; and this unhappy lunatic has been earnestly treated as a\r\n‘philosopher,’ and his drivel put forward as a ‘system’--this man\r\nwhose scribbling is one single long divagation, in whose writings\r\nmadness shrieks out from every line! Dr. Kirchner, a philosopher by\r\nprofession, and the author of numerous philosophical writings, in a\r\nnewspaper article on Nietzsche’s book, _Der Fall Wagner_, lays great\r\nstress on the fact that ‘it superabounds, as it were, in intellectual\r\nhealth.’ Ordinary university professors--such as G. Adler, in Freiburg,\r\nand others--extol Nietzsche as a ‘bold and original thinker,’\r\nand with solemn seriousness take up a position in respect of his\r\n‘philosophy’--some with avowed enthusiasm, and some with carefully\r\nconsidered reservations! In the face of such incurably deep mental\r\nobtuseness, it cannot excite wonder if the clear-thinking and healthy\r\nportion of the young spirits of the present generation should, with\r\nhasty generalization, extend to philosophy itself the contempt deserved\r\nby its officially-appointed teachers. These teachers undertake to\r\nintroduce their students into mental philosophy, and are yet without\r\nthe capacity to distinguish from rational thought the incoherent\r\nfugitive ideation of a maniac.\r\n\r\nDr. Hermann Türck[427] characterizes in excellent words the disciples\r\nof Nietzsche: ‘This piece of wisdom [‘nothing is true; all is\r\npermissible’] in the mouth of a morally insane man of letters has\r\n... found ready response among persons who, in consequence of a\r\nmoral defect, feel themselves to be in contradiction to the demands\r\nof society. This aforesaid intellectual proletariat of large towns\r\nis especially jubilant over the new magnificent discovery that all\r\nmorality and all truth are completely superfluous and pernicious to\r\nthe development of the individual. It is true that these persons\r\nhave always in secret said to themselves, “Nothing is true--all is\r\npermissible,” and have also, as far as possible, acted accordingly.\r\nBut now they can avow it openly, and with pride; for Friedrich\r\nNietzsche, the new prophet, has vaunted this maxim as the most exalted\r\ntruth of life.... It is not society which is right in its estimation\r\nof morality, science, and true art. Oh dear no! The individuals who\r\nfollow their egoistical personal aims only--who act only as if truth\r\nwere of consequence to them--they, the counterfeiters of truth, those\r\nunscrupulous penny-a-liners, lying critics, literary thieves, and\r\nmanufacturers of pseudo-realistic brummagem--they are the true heroes,\r\nthe masters of the situation, the truly free spirits.’\r\n\r\nThat is the truth, but not the whole truth. Without doubt, the real\r\nNietzsche gang consists of born imbecile criminals, and of simpletons\r\ndrunk with sonorous words. But besides these gallows birds without the\r\ncourage and strength for criminal actions, and the imbeciles who allow\r\nthemselves to be stupefied and, as it were, hypnotized by the roar\r\nand rush of fustian, the banner of the insane babbler is followed by\r\nothers, who must be judged otherwise and in part more gently. In fact,\r\nNietzsche’s ranting includes some ideas which, in part, respond to a\r\nwidespread notion of the age, and in part are capable of awakening the\r\ndeception that, in spite of all the exaggeration and insane distortion\r\nof exposition, they contain a germ of truth and right; and these ideas\r\nexplain why many persons agree with them who can hardly be reproached\r\nwith lack of clearness and critical capacity.\r\n\r\nNietzsche’s fundamental idea of utter disregard and brutal contempt\r\nfor all the rights of others standing in the way of an egoistical\r\ndesire, must please the generation reared under the Bismarckian system.\r\nPrince Bismarck is a monstrous personality, raging over a country\r\nlike a tornado in the torrid zone; it crushes all in its devastating\r\ncourse, and leaves behind as traces, a widespread annihilation of\r\ncharacter, destruction of notions of right, and demolition of morality.\r\nIn political life the system of Bismarck is a sort of Jesuitism in\r\ncuirass. ‘The end sanctifies the means,’ and the means are not (as with\r\nthe supple sons of Loyola) cunning, obstinacy, secret trickery, but\r\nopen brutality, violence, the blow with the fist, and the stroke with\r\nthe sword. The end which sanctifies the means of the Jesuit in cuirass\r\nmay sometimes be of general utility; but it will quite as often, and\r\noftener, be an egoistical one. In its author this system of the most\r\nprimitive barbarism had ever a certain grandeur, for it had its origin\r\nin a powerful will, which with heroic boldness always placed itself\r\nat stake, and entered into every fight with the savage determination\r\nto ‘conquer or die.’ In its imitators, on the contrary, it has got\r\nstunted to ‘swaggering’ or ‘bullying,’ _i.e._, to that most abject and\r\ncontemptible cowardice which crawls on its belly before the strong,\r\nbut maltreats with the most extreme insolence the completely unarmed,\r\nthe unconditionally harmless and weak, from whom no resistance and\r\nno danger are in any way to be apprehended. The ‘bullies’ gratefully\r\nrecognise themselves in Nietzsche’s ‘over-man,’ and Nietzsche’s\r\nso-called ‘philosophy’ is in reality the philosophy of ‘bullying.’ His\r\ndoctrine shows how Bismarck’s system is mirrored in the brain of a\r\nmaniac. Nietzsche could not have come to the front and succeeded in any\r\nbut the Bismarckian and post-Bismarckian era. He would, doubtless, have\r\nbeen delirious at whatever period he might have lived; but his insanity\r\nwould not have assumed the special colour and tendency now perceptible\r\nin it. It is true that sometimes Nietzsche vexes himself over the fact\r\nthat ‘the type of the new Germany most rich in success in all that has\r\ndepth ... fails in “swagger,”’ and he then proclaims: ‘It were well for\r\nus not to exchange too cheaply our ancient renown as a people of depth\r\nfor Prussian “swagger,” and the wit and sand of Berlin.’[428] But in\r\nother places he betrays what really displeases him in the ‘swagger,’ at\r\nwhich he directs his philosophical verse; it makes too much ado about\r\nthe officer. ‘The moment he [the ‘Prussian officer’] speaks and moves,\r\nhe is the most forward and tasteless figure in old Europe--unknown\r\nto himself.... And unknown also to the good Germans, who wonder at\r\nhim as a man of the highest and most distinguished society, and\r\nwillingly take their tone from him.’[429] Nietzsche cannot consent to\r\nthat--Nietzsche, who apprehends that there can be no God, as in that\r\ncase he himself must be this God. He cannot suffer the ‘good German’ to\r\nplace the officer above him. But apart from this inconvenience, which\r\nis involved in the system of ‘swagger,’ he finds everything in it good\r\nand beautiful, and lauds it as ‘intrepidity of glance, courage and\r\nhardness of the cutting hand, an inflexible will for dangerous voyages\r\nof discovery, for spiritualized North-Polar expeditions under desolate\r\nand dangerous skies,’[430] and prophesies exultingly that for Europe\r\nthere will soon begin an era of brass, an era of war, soldiers, arms,\r\nviolence. Hence it is natural that ‘swaggerers’ should hail him as\r\ntheir very own peculiar philosopher.\r\n\r\nBesides anarchists, born with incapacity for adaptation, his\r\n‘individualism,’ _i.e._, his insane ego-mania, for which the external\r\nworld is non-existent, was bound to attract those who instinctively\r\nfeel that at the present day the State encroaches too deeply and too\r\nviolently on the rights of the individual, and, in addition to the\r\nnecessary sacrifices of strength and time, exacts from him such as\r\nhe cannot undergo without destructive loss of self-esteem, viz., the\r\nsacrifice of judgment, knowledge, conviction, and human dignity. These\r\nthirsters for freedom believe that they have found in Nietzsche the\r\nspokesman of their healthy revolt against the State, as the oppressor\r\nof independent spirits, and as the crusher of strong characters. They\r\ncommit the same error which I have already pointed out in the sincere\r\nadherents of the Decadents and of Ibsen; they do not see that Nietzsche\r\nconfounds the conscious with the subconscious man; that the individual,\r\nfor whom he demands perfect freedom, is the man, not of knowledge and\r\njudgment, but of blind craving, requiring the satisfaction of his\r\nlascivious instincts at any price; that he is not the moral, but the\r\nsensual, man.\r\n\r\nFinally, his consequential airs have also increased the number of\r\nhis followers. Many of those marching in his train reject his moral\r\ndoctrine, but wax enthusiastic over such expressions as these: ‘It\r\nmight some time happen that the masses should become masters....\r\nTherefore, O my brothers, there is need of a new nobility, the\r\nadversary of all plebeians and all violent domination, and who\r\ninscribes anew on a new tablet the word “Nobility.”’[431]\r\n\r\nThere is at the present time a widespread conviction that the\r\nenthusiasm for equality was a grievous error of the great Revolution.\r\nA doctrine opposed to all natural laws is justly resisted. Humanity\r\nhas need of a hierarchy. It must have leaders and models. It cannot\r\ndo without an aristocracy. But the nobleman to whom the human herd\r\nmay concede the most elevated place will certainly not be Nietzsche’s\r\n‘over-man,’ the ego-maniac, the criminal, the robber, the slave of\r\nhis maddened instincts, but the man of richer knowledge, higher\r\nintelligence, clearer judgment, and firmer self-discipline. The\r\nexistence of humanity is a combat, which it cannot carry on without\r\ncaptains. As long as the combat is of men against men, the herd\r\nrequires a herdsman of strong muscles and ready blow. In a more perfect\r\nstate, in which all humanity fights collectively against Nature only,\r\nit chooses as its chief the man of richest brain, most disciplined\r\nwill and concentrated attention. This man is the best observer, but he\r\nis also one who feels most acutely and rapidly, who can most vividly\r\npicture to himself the condition of the external world, hence the\r\nman of the liveliest sympathy and most comprehensive interest. The\r\n‘over-man’ of the healthy development of the species is a Paraclete\r\nof knowledge and unselfish love, not a bloodthirsty ‘splendid beast\r\nof prey.’ This is not borne in mind by those who believe that in\r\nNietzsche’s aristocratism they have found a clear expression of their\r\nown obscure views as to the need of noble natures of light and leading.\r\n\r\nNietzsche’s false individualism and aristocratism is capable of\r\nmisleading superficial readers. Their error may be accounted a\r\nmitigating circumstance. But even taking this into consideration, it\r\nstill ever remains a disgrace to the German intellectual life of the\r\npresent age, that in Germany a pronounced maniac should have been\r\nregarded as a philosopher, and have founded a school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n_REALISM._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nZOLA AND HIS SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was necessary to treat in detail the two forms of degeneracy in\r\nliterature and art hitherto examined, _i.e._, mysticism and ego-mania,\r\ninasmuch as their career of development seems to be still in the\r\nascendant, and they are actively at work in making themselves masters\r\nof the æsthetic conscience of our times. Concerning the third form,\r\nrealism or naturalism, I can afford to be much briefer, for two\r\nreasons: one having to do with my subject, the other with myself.\r\nThe former reason is that, in the land of its origin, naturalism is\r\nalready wholly vanquished, and we do not kill a corpse--we bury it. The\r\npersonal reason is that I have already devoted myself elsewhere to the\r\nthorough examination of naturalism.[432] The conclusions I there came\r\nto I continue to maintain, as regards the appreciation of its tendency,\r\nand I should only wish to limit them by a strong reservation, in so far\r\nas they greatly over-estimate M. Zola’s abilities.\r\n\r\nThat naturalism in France is done with is admitted by all the world,\r\nand is really only disputed by Zola himself. ‘There is no doubt\r\nwhatever as to the tendencies of the new generation of literary men,’\r\nsays M. Rémy de Gourmont; ‘they are rigorously anti-naturalist. There\r\nhas been no question of forming a party or issuing orders; no crusade\r\nwas organized; it is individually that we have separated ourselves,\r\nhorror-stricken, from a literature the baseness of which made us sick.\r\nPerhaps there is even less disgust than indifference. I remember, when\r\nM. Zola’s last novel but one came out, that, among the eight or ten\r\ncollaborators of the _Mercure de France_ (a Symbolist journal), it\r\nwas impossible for us to find anyone who had read through _La Bête\r\nhumaine_, or anyone who would have consented to read it with sufficient\r\ncare to review it. This species of book, and the method which dictates\r\nit, appears to us quite antiquated with the flavour of bygone years;\r\nmore remote and more superannuated than the most truculent follies of\r\nromanticism.’[433]\r\n\r\nAmong the disciples of Zola, among those who collaborated in the\r\n_Soirées de Médan_, as among those who followed him later, there\r\nis scarcely one who has remained faithful to his tendency. Guy de\r\nMaupassant, before he was placed in the lunatic asylum where he\r\ndied, ended by turning more and more towards the psychological\r\nnovel. Joris Karl Huysmans, whom we have studied above in his new\r\nskin as a Diabolist and Decadent, cannot find words bitter enough\r\nfor naturalism. J. H. Rosny writes novels now in which the scene is\r\nlaid in the Stone Age, and the subject of which is the abduction of\r\na brawny brachycephalous pre-Aryan woman by a tall, white-skinned,\r\ndolichocephalous Aryan man.[434] When Zola’s _La Terre_ appeared, five\r\nof his disciples--Paul Bonnetain, J. H. Rosny, just mentioned, Lucien\r\nDescaves, Paul Margueritte, and Gustave Guiches--deemed it necessary to\r\nprotest, in a public manifesto, and with a solemnity somewhat comical,\r\nagainst the obscenities of this novel, and to disavow their master\r\nin proper and befitting form. If the novels of M. Zola himself still\r\ncontinue to find a very good and steady market, as he declares with\r\npride, this in no way proves that his tendency is still popular. The\r\nmasses persist in habits, once adopted, much longer than the leaders\r\nand creators do. If the former continue to follow M. Zola as before,\r\nthe latter have already wholly left him. The success of his last\r\nnovels is explained, moreover, on quite other than artistic grounds.\r\nHis _flair_ for what is occupying public opinion is, perhaps, the most\r\nessential part of his talent. He chooses from the outset subjects in\r\nfavour of which he is assured of the positive interest of a numerous\r\npublic, no matter how they may be treated. With books which relate, in\r\nthe form of a novel, the story of the financial crisis of 1882, or the\r\nwar of 1870, as _L’Argent_ and _La Débâcle_, every known French author\r\nis sure to awaken in his own country a passionate interest even to this\r\nday. And M. Zola could equally count on a numerous connection of lovers\r\nof the obscene and nasty. This public remains faithful to him, and\r\nfinds in him all it seeks. But it is a long time since he acquired any\r\nnew adherents in his own country, and abroad he only obtains them among\r\npeople who anxiously follow every fashion, whether it be in neckties\r\nor books, but who are too ignorant to know as yet that M. Zola, in\r\nFrance itself, has long since ceased to be the last fashion.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of his disciples, M. Zola is the inventor of realism\r\nin literature. This is a pretension which only young fellows, who are\r\nignorant beyond all conception, could raise, and for whom the history\r\nof the world only begins at the moment when they have deigned to\r\nrecognise it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the word ‘realism’ itself has no æsthetic significance.\r\nIn philosophy it denotes an opinion for which the general phenomenon of\r\nthe world is the expression of a material reality. Applied to art and\r\nliterature, it possesses no conception whatever. This I have explicitly\r\ndemonstrated in another place (_Paris unter der dritten Republik_), and\r\nwill confine myself here to going very briefly over the argument.\r\n\r\nThose ale-house æsthetics, who distinguish between realism and\r\nidealism, explain the former as the effort of the artist to observe\r\nthings and to reproduce them with truth. But this attempt is common to\r\nevery author, whoever he may be. No one of deliberate purpose wanders\r\nfrom the truth in his creations; and even if he wished to do so, he\r\ncould not, as this would contradict all the laws of human thought.\r\nEvery one of our presentations, in fact, is based on an observation\r\nonce made by us, and even when we invent _ad libitum_, we only work\r\nwith the memory-images recollected from previous observations. If,\r\nin spite of this, one work gives a greater impression of truth than\r\nanother, it is a question, not of this or that æsthetic tendency, but\r\nexclusively of the degree of talent. A true poet is always true; an\r\nincapable imitator can never be so. The first is true even when he\r\ndisdains always to adhere closely to reality in details; the latter is\r\nnot so even when he clings, with punctilious attention, and with the\r\nmethod of a land-surveyor, to little external details.\r\n\r\nIf one bear in mind the psychological conditions in which a work of art\r\ncomes into existence, all the rhodomontade of so-called ‘realism’ is\r\nimmediately recognised. The origin of every veritable work of art is\r\nan emotion. This is aroused either by a vital process in the internal\r\norgans of the artist, or by a sense-impression which he receives from\r\nthe external world. In both cases the artist feels the necessity of\r\ngiving expression to his emotion in a work of art. If this emotion is\r\nof organic origin, he will choose from among his memory-images, or\r\nhis sense-impressions of the moment, those which are in harmony with\r\nhis emotion, and will compose with them. If its origin is external,\r\nhe will employ in his composition mainly phenomena of the external\r\nworld, sensuous experiences which have evoked in him the emotion\r\ndemanding objective shape, and he will combine with this, similar\r\nmemory-images in accordance with the laws of association. As may be\r\nseen, the process in the two cases is absolutely the same: the artist,\r\nunder the control of an emotion, welds direct sense-perceptions and\r\nmemory-images into a work of art which brings him relief; only,\r\nsometimes the former, sometimes the latter, are predominant, according\r\nto whether the emotion has its origin in sense-perceptions or in\r\norganic processes. Speaking roughly, the works which result from an\r\nemotion aroused by the phenomena of the world may well be called\r\nrealistic, and those expressing an organic emotion idealistic. These\r\ndenominations, however, have not any really distinctive value. Among\r\nthoroughly sane individuals the emotions originate almost solely from\r\nimpressions of the external world; among those whose nervous life\r\nis more or less diseased, namely, among hysterical, neurasthenic,\r\nand degenerate subjects, and every kind of lunatic, they originate\r\nmuch more frequently in internal organic processes. Sane artists\r\nwill produce works, as a rule, in which perception will predominate;\r\nartists unhealthily emotional will produce works in which the play of\r\nassociation of ideas predominates--in other words, imagination working\r\nprincipally on memory-images. And if a false designation is absolutely\r\nadhered to, it might be said that the first, as a general rule, will\r\nproduce works which are so-called realistic, and the second, works\r\nso-called idealistic. In no case is the work of art a faithful image of\r\nmaterial reality; its genesis excludes this possibility. It is always\r\nthe incarnation of a subjective emotion only. To desire to know the\r\nworld by means of a work of art is a false proceeding; but the whole\r\nessence of a personality reveals itself in it to him who knows how\r\nto read. The work of art is never a document in the sense attached\r\nby naturalistic cant to this word, _i.e._, a reliable objective\r\npresentation of external facts; but it is always a confession of the\r\nauthor; it betrays, consciously or unconsciously, his way of feeling\r\nand thinking; it lays bare his emotions, and shows what ideas fill his\r\nconsciousness, and are at the disposal of the emotion which strives for\r\nexpression. It is not a mirror of the world, but a reflection of the\r\nsoul of the artist.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought, perhaps, that at least the mainly imitative arts,\r\npainting and sculpture, are capable of a faithful reproduction of\r\nreality, and thus are realisms properly so called. Even this is an\r\nerror. It would never occur to a painter or a sculptor to place himself\r\nbefore a phenomenon, and reproduce it without selection, without\r\naccentuations and suppressions. And why does he do this? If he imitates\r\nan aspect, it is evidently because something in that aspect captivates\r\nor pleases him--a harmony of colours, an effect of light, a line of\r\nmotion. Involuntarily he will accentuate and throw into relief the\r\nfeature which has inspired him with the desire to imitate the aspect\r\nin question, and his work, consequently, will no more represent the\r\nphenomenon such as it really was, but as he saw it; it will only be a\r\nfresh proof, therefore, of his emotion, not the cast of a phenomenon.\r\nTo work absolutely in the method of a camera obscura and a sensitive\r\nplate would be only possible to a very obtuse handicraftsman, who,\r\nin the presence of the visible world, had no feeling for anything,\r\nno pleasure, no disgust, no aspirations of any kind. However, it is\r\nnot at all probable that so atrophied a being will ever have had the\r\ninclination to become an artist, and could acquire, even in a moderate\r\ndegree, the technical skill necessary for such a profession.\r\n\r\nAnd if literal realism, the positive actual imitation of the\r\nphenomenon, be interdicted even in the plastic arts by their intrinsic\r\nnature, with how much greater reason is it forbidden to imaginative\r\nwriting! The painter can, after all, if he wishes to debase himself\r\nand his art to the lowest degree, reduce the co-operation of his\r\npersonality in a work of art (or, to be more exact, to the _work_,\r\nfor then there can be no question of art) to an extremely feeble, a\r\nscarcely perceptible point; he can reduce himself to the condition of\r\na mere camera obscura, transmit his visual impressions in the most\r\nmechanical manner possible to his motor organs, and compel himself to\r\nthink and feel nothing during the progress of the work. His picture\r\nis furnished for him by Nature itself: it is his optical horizon. If,\r\nthen, he wishes to exercise no choice, to express nothing of his own,\r\nnot even to compose, still there remains the possibility of copying the\r\nphenomena which are enclosed within the limits of his field of vision.\r\nHis so-called picture is then no more than an expressionless fragment\r\nof the world, in which the artist’s personality is only represented\r\nby the frame which encloses it, not because the phenomena of Nature\r\nreally terminates at that point, but because the eye of the painter\r\nonly embraces that portion, and no more; nevertheless, it is a picture\r\nin a technical sense, _i.e._, a picture that can be hung upon the wall\r\nand looked at. The imaginative writer (dichter), on the contrary, does\r\nnot find his work ready in this way. It is not provided for him by\r\nNature itself. His subjects are not developed in space, but in time.\r\nThey are not arranged by the side of one another in such a way that\r\nthe eye perceives them and can retain all it sees; but they succeed\r\neach other, and the imaginative writer must by his own intellect assign\r\nthem their limits, he must himself decide what he ought to seize\r\nupon and what he must let go; where the phenomenon begins which he\r\nwishes to utilize in his work, and where it ends. He cannot begin or\r\nend a conversation in the middle of a word, in imitation of M. Jean\r\nBéraud, for example, who in a well-known picture has made the frame\r\ncut off the wheels of a waggon in the middle. He may not produce an\r\ninexpressive photograph of the uniform course of events of life and the\r\nworld. He must fence round and dam up certain places in the course of\r\nevents. In doing this he clearly affirms himself and his personality.\r\nHe betrays his original stamp. He allows his intentions, views, and\r\nsentiments to be recognised. If amongst a million of contemporary\r\nhuman destinies he relates one only, it is that for some reason or\r\nother this particular one has interested him more than the rest of\r\nthe million. If he transmits to us only some few features, ideas,\r\nconversations, and actions of the person he has selected (not even a\r\nmillionth part of all that makes up his actual life) it is because,\r\nfor some reason or other, these seemed to him more important and more\r\ncharacteristic than all the rest; because in his opinion they prove\r\nsomething, they express an idea not conceived by things as they are,\r\nbut which he believes he can deduce from reality, or which he desires\r\nto read into it. Thus, his ‘realistic’ work always reproduces his\r\nthoughts only, his interpretation of reality, his interest in it, and\r\nnot reality itself. If the imaginative writer wished to transcribe the\r\nworld phonographically or photographically, his work would no longer\r\nbe a poem, even in a purely technical sense; it would not even be a\r\nbook, to the extent that the work of the painter who only photographs\r\nstill continues, in a purely technical sense, to be a picture; it would\r\nbe something with neither form, sense, nor name; for, in reproducing\r\nthe existence of a single human being during one day only, thousands\r\nof pages could be filled if all his sensations, thoughts, words, and\r\nactions were treated as of equal value. That selection is therefore\r\nmade among them which is the subjectivity of the imaginative writer,\r\n_i.e._, the reverse of ‘realism.’\r\n\r\nBesides, the work of the painter addresses itself to the same senses as\r\nthe phenomenon of Nature itself, and reproduces it with the help of the\r\nsame means by which the world itself is revealed to the senses, viz.,\r\nwith light and colour. Of course the lights, colours, and lines of the\r\npainter are not exactly those of the real phenomenon, and it is only\r\nin consequence of an illusion that, in his imitation, the phenomenon\r\nis recognised; but this illusion is the work of such inferior cerebral\r\ncentres that even animals are capable of it, as is demonstrated by\r\nthe classical anecdote so well known of the birds wishing to peck\r\nat the bunch of grapes painted by Zeuxis. The imaginative writer,\r\non the contrary, does not address himself to the senses; to be\r\nmore exact, he appeals by hearing or sight, to which he presents\r\nspoken or written words, not to the centres of perception, as the\r\nplastic artist does in the first instance, but to the higher centres\r\nof conception, judgment, and reasoning. Nor has he the means for\r\ndirectly reproducing the sensible phenomenon itself, but he must first\r\ntranslate the phenomenon into concepts under a linguistic, _i.e._, a\r\nconventional, form. This is, however, an excessively complicated and\r\nhighly differentiated activity, which bears completely the impress of\r\nthe personality exercising it. If even two eyes do not see in the same\r\nmanner, how much less can two brains perceive and interpret in the\r\nsame way what the eye has seen, class it with pre-existing concepts,\r\nassociate it with feelings and representations, and clothe it in\r\ntraditional forms of language? The activity of the imaginative writer,\r\ntherefore, is incomparably more than that of the artist, essentially\r\npersonal; the elaboration of sense-impressions into representations,\r\nand the translation of representations into words, are so peculiarly\r\nindividual, so exclusively subjective, that for this cause also\r\nimaginative writing can never be reality itself, _i.e._, ‘realistic.’\r\n\r\nThe notion of so-called ‘realism’ cannot withstand either psychological\r\nor æsthetic criticism. We might, perhaps, attempt an external,\r\nsuperficial, practical conception of it, and say, for example, Realism\r\nis the method in the application of which the imaginative writer starts\r\nfrom his perceptions and observations, and seeks his subjects in the\r\nenvironment he knows personally; idealism is the opposite method,\r\nwhich that writer employs who, in creating, yields to the play of\r\nimagination, and who, in order not to impede its free energy, borrows\r\nhis materials from remote times and countries, or from social strata\r\nof which he has no direct knowledge, but which he conceives only in\r\nthe visions of aspiration, intuition, or surmise. Reasonable and\r\nplausible as this explanation appears, it, too, nevertheless, dissolves\r\ninto blue mist when more closely examined. For, in fact, the choice\r\nof subject-matter, the surroundings from which it is borrowed, or\r\nin which it is placed, have no decisive signification; no method is\r\ntherein manifested, but merely the author’s personality. One in whom\r\nobservation predominates will be ‘realistic,’ _i.e._, will express\r\nexperiences, even if he pretends to speak of men and things placed\r\nwholly beyond the reach of his observation; and the other in whom the\r\nmechanical association of ideas prevails will be ‘idealistic,’ _i.e._,\r\nhe will simply follow the wanderings of his imagination, even when he\r\ndesires to represent circumstances which may be personally familiar to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLet us give one example only of the two cases. What is more\r\n‘idealistic’ than fairy-stories? Very well, here are some passages\r\nfrom the best-known fairy-tales of the brothers Grimm: ‘There was once\r\nupon a time a king’s daughter who went into the forest and seated\r\nherself on the brink of a cool fountain’ (_The Frog Prince; or, Iron\r\nHenry_). ‘But the little sister at home [he is speaking of the daughter\r\nof a king who had driven away his twelve sons] grew up, and remained\r\nthe only child. Once there was a great washing-day, and amongst\r\nthe washing were twelve men’s shirts. “For whom are these shirts?”\r\ndemanded the princess; “they are much too small for my father.” Then\r\nthe laundress told her that she had had twelve brothers,’ etc.; ‘and\r\nas the little sister sat in the meadow in the afternoon bleaching the\r\nlinen, the words of the laundress came into her mind,’ etc. (_The\r\nTwelve Brothers_). ‘The wood-cutter obeyed; he fetched his child, and\r\ngave her to the Virgin Mary, who carried her up into heaven. There\r\nthe child lived happily; she ate nothing but sweet cakes, and drank\r\nnew milk,’ etc. ‘So fourteen years went by in heaven. Then the Virgin\r\nMary had to take a long journey; but before she went away, she called\r\nthe girl to her, and said, “Dear child, I entrust you with the keys of\r\nthe thirteen doors of Paradise,”’ etc. (_Mary’s Child_). The unknown\r\nwriter of these fairy-tales transports his stories into royal palaces,\r\nor even into heaven--_i.e._, into surroundings which he certainly does\r\nnot know; but he endows beings and things, and even the Virgin Mary,\r\nwith such traits as are known and familiar to him by observation.\r\nFrom the royal palace one enters a wood or a meadow as one might on\r\nleaving a farm; the princess runs to the fountain in the forest quite\r\nalone, looks after the linen, and bleaches it on the grass, just\r\nlike a domestic servant. The Holy Virgin undertakes a journey, and\r\nconfides the keys of the household to her adopted daughter, as a rich\r\nchâtelaine might do. These fairy-tales are composed from a peasant’s\r\nown experience, who describes his own world with honest realism, and\r\nsimply gives other names to the figures and circumstances with which he\r\nis familiar. M. Edmond de Goncourt, on the contrary, the great pioneer\r\n‘realist,’ relates, in his novel _La Faustin_, the love-story of a Lord\r\nAnnandale and an actress of the Théâtre Français, which elicits from\r\nM. F. Brunetière, the critic, these observations: ‘I should much like\r\nto hear M. Zola’s opinion on M. de Goncourt’s novel. What can M. Zola,\r\nwho has jested so eloquently on the subject of novels of adventure--of\r\nthose novels in which princes walked about incognito with their pockets\r\nfull of diamonds--think in his inmost heart of this Lord Annandale\r\nthrowing handfuls of gold out of the windows, and ruling from one day\r\nto another over fifty English servants in his mansion in Paris, without\r\ncounting the retainers of his lady? What can M. Zola, who has made\r\nmerry so comfortably over the idealistic novel, as he calls it, think\r\nof this one in which love triumphant carries off the lovers into the\r\nadorable world of dreams--what can he think to himself concerning\r\nthis passionate tenderness which M. de Goncourt’s Englishman has for\r\nthe tragedienne, this almost deified gallantry, this sensual liaison\r\n_dans le bleu_, this physical love in ideality, and all the rest of the\r\njargon which I spare the reader?’[435] M. Edmond de Goncourt professes\r\nto depict a contemporary Englishman, an actress also of our own times,\r\nevents in Parisian life--_i.e._, all of them matters he might have\r\nobserved, and with which he ought to be familiar; but what he does\r\nrelate is so incredible, so impossible, unprecedented, that one can\r\nonly shrug one’s shoulders over the childish fable. Thus, the German\r\nstory-teller who conducts us into a society of angels, saints, and\r\nkings, really shows us healthy, robust peasants and lasses whose living\r\nreality is in no way diminished by the carnival crowns and gilded-paper\r\nhalos playfully placed on their heads; while the French realist\r\nwho would transport us into Parisian life among Parisians, floats\r\nbefore our eyes fleshless phantoms moving in clouds of cigar-smoke,\r\nmarsh-mists, and punch-flames, and who remain just as unreal, for all\r\nthe effort of the author to conjure into them a distant resemblance to\r\nan Englishman in a frock-coat, and a hysterical lady in a lace-trimmed\r\nnégligée. The author of the fairy-tales is a realist in the sense of\r\nthe explanation given above; the novelist of Parisian manners, Edmond\r\nde Goncourt, is an idealist of the most aggravating type.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side we approach this pretended realism, we never succeed\r\nin seeing in it a concept, but only an empty word. Every method of\r\ninvestigation leads us to the same result--viz., that there is no\r\nrealism in poetry, _i.e._, no impersonal, actual copy of reality; there\r\nare only the various personalities of the poet. The only decisive thing\r\nis the individuality of the poet. One of them draws from the phenomenon\r\nof Nature, another from his internal organic processes, those emotions\r\nwhich incite them to create. One is capable of attention, and observes;\r\nanother is the slave of an unbridled association of ideas. In one\r\nthe presentation of the ‘not-self’ predominates in consciousness,\r\nin another the ‘self.’ I do not hesitate to express the matter in a\r\nsingle word--one is healthy and in an evolution of growth; the other\r\nis changed more or less pathologically--has more or less fallen into\r\ndegeneracy. The healthy poet mingles knowledge with every one of his\r\nworks, whether it be Dante’s _Inferno_ or Goethe’s _Faust_; and if\r\nheld desirable, this element of knowledge, which it is not possible to\r\nacquire except by attention and observation, may be called realism.\r\nThe degenerate poet never fashions anything but empty soap-bubbles of\r\nknowledge, even when he maintains, and is himself convinced, that he is\r\ngiving out what he has observed; and this confused ebullition of ideas,\r\nshot in the best cases with changing hues, but most frequently simply\r\ndirty froth, is very often called, by a misnomer, idealism.\r\n\r\nStill another and the latest meaning has been applied to realism; it\r\nstands for the systematic treatment of the lower ranks of life, and\r\ncommonplace men and things. According to this definition, the works\r\nin which labourers, peasants, petty bourgeois, etc., appear, would\r\nbe realistic, and those in which gods, heroes, kings, etc., take\r\npart, idealistic. Louis XIV., according to the well-known anecdote\r\nwhen Teniers’ tavern-scenes were exhibited before him, let fall\r\nthe indignant and disdainful comment, ‘Take away these grotesque\r\nthings!’ He would not have condemned an artistic method and manner\r\nof representation, but the baseness of the subject only would have\r\noffended his Olympian eye. This explanation of the term ‘realism’ is\r\na little more comprehensible than the others; but I have no need to\r\nshow how grossly external and how philosophically and æsthetically\r\nworthless it is. We have seen, in fact, above, how the simplest\r\nfeelings and ideas of peasants may be attributed to gods and to\r\nkings; and, conversely, there is no lack of works in which a royal\r\ncrown or a saintly halo hovers invisibly over the heads of human\r\nbeings in the lowest social position. In Gregory Samarow’s novels,\r\nemperors and kings disport themselves who feel, think, and speak like\r\nthe commercial travellers of a third-rate wine business; in Berthold\r\nAuerbach’s village stories we see peasants who in heart and head are\r\nof the highest nobility, sometimes even semi-divine. The one kind is\r\nas unreal as the other, only in the first we discern the craft of\r\nthe sensation-monger, in the second there speaks to us the refined\r\nand tender-souled poet. In _The Mill on the Floss_, by George Eliot,\r\nwe find a farm-servant, Luke, and a miller’s daughter, Maggie, who\r\nwould do honour to any Pantheon in the grandeur of their character and\r\nmorals; in Thackeray’s _Vanity Fair_ we are shown a Marquis of Steyne,\r\nvery magnificent and very proud, and another such, Earl Bareacres,\r\nwith neither of whom would any decent man shake hands. Those are as\r\ntrue as these; but whereas the former betray the heart of a poet full\r\nof love and pity, the latter reveal the soul of an artist overflowing\r\nwith bitterness and wrath. Which, now, is noble--the emperors and\r\nkings of Samarow or the Black Forest peasants of Auerbach? Which is\r\nplebeian--the farming men of George Eliot or the powerful English peers\r\nof Thackeray? And which of these works must be qualified as realistic,\r\nwhich as idealistic, if realism signifies being occupied with inferior\r\npersons and conditions, idealism with those that are superior?\r\n\r\nHence to serious investigation, which does not stop at the mere jingle\r\nof words, the expressions ‘realism’ and ‘idealism’ convey no meaning.\r\nWe will now see what the partisans of M. Emile Zola give out as his\r\noriginality, in what he himself claims to be a model and a pioneer, and\r\nhow he justifies his pretension of impersonating a totally new epoch in\r\nthe history of literature.\r\n\r\nM. Zola’s disciples boast of his art of description and his\r\n‘impressionism.’ I make a great difference between the two. Description\r\nendeavours to seize upon the characteristic features of the phenomenon\r\nby all the senses at once, and convey them in words; impressionism\r\nshows the conscious state of a person receiving impressions in the\r\ndomain of one sense only, seeing things only, hearing them only,\r\nfeeling them only, etc. Description is the work of a brain which\r\ncomprehends the things it perceives in their connection and their\r\nessence; impressionism is the work of a brain which receives from the\r\nphenomenon only the sensuous elements--and by a one-sided aspect--of\r\nknowledge, but not knowledge itself. The describer recognises in a\r\ntree, a tree, with all the ideas which this concept includes. The\r\nimpressionist sees before him merely a mass of colour composed of\r\nspots of different greens, on which the sun flashes here and there\r\npoints and rays of light. Description for its own sake, as well as\r\nimpressionism, are, in poetry, an æsthetic and psychological error,\r\nas will be demonstrated as briefly as possible; but even this error\r\nwas not invented by M. Zola, for long before him the romanticists,\r\nand Théophile Gautier particularly, cultivated the broad style of\r\ndescription, inorganically interpolated into literary composition; and,\r\non the subject of impressionism, the brothers De Goncourt showed M.\r\nZola the way.\r\n\r\nThe purely objective description of objects is science, when it is\r\nworth anyone’s while to acquire of them as clear a representation\r\nas may be communicated by words without the assistance of image or\r\nnumber. Such description is simply child’s play and waste of time,\r\nwhen no one is interested to pause and look at the things described,\r\neither because they are too well known or because they are without\r\nimportance.[436] Finally, it rises into art while remaining of an\r\ninferior species, when it chooses words so well that it follows the\r\nmost delicate peculiarities of the objects, and at the same time calls\r\nout the emotions that the observer experiences during his observations,\r\n_i.e._, when the words employed have not only the value of a just\r\nportrayal of sensuously perceptible properties, but have an emotional\r\ncolouring, and appear accompanied by images and metaphors. We may\r\ncite as examples of art of portrayal all good descriptions of travel,\r\nfrom the _Voyage to the Equinoxial Regions of the New Continent_,\r\nby Alexander Humboldt, to _Sahara and Soudan_, by Nachtigal, _Im\r\nHerzen Afrikas_, by Schweinfurth, or Edmond de Amicis’ books on\r\n_Constantinople_, _Morocco_, _Spain_, _Holland_, etc. But these have\r\nnothing in common with imaginative writing, which always has for its\r\nobject man, with his ideas and sentiments, not excepting fables of\r\nanimals, parables, allegories, fairy-tales, all the hybrid forms in\r\nwhich the human element of all imagination appears disguised as an\r\nanthropomorphism applied to animals, and even to inanimate objects. The\r\nmaterial frame, the scene and surrounding, have no importance in an\r\nimaginative work, except in so far as they affect the person or persons\r\nof whom it treats. The imaginative writer may be regarded either as a\r\nspectator who narrates human events as they develop before his eyes,\r\nor as an actor in these events, which he looks upon and feels with the\r\nconsciousness of one of the personages concerned. In both cases he can\r\nnaturally only perceive in the material surroundings whatever plays a\r\npart in the events themselves. If he is a spectator, he will certainly\r\nnot let his eyes wander over the field of vision indifferently, but\r\nwill pause before a scene which attracts his attention, and for which\r\nhe seeks to arouse our interest. If he has himself adopted the disguise\r\nof one of the actors, he will be even more completely absorbed by the\r\nhuman events in which he himself co-operates, and will preserve still\r\nless any inclination to stroll indifferently by the side of scenes\r\nwhich have nothing to do with his given state of mind, and divert him\r\nfrom acts and feelings with which he is preoccupied at the moment.\r\nHence an imaginative work which is true to human nature will only\r\ncontain descriptions of such material surroundings as a spectator\r\n(absorbed in the actual events which form the subject of the work, or\r\nas one of its actors) is in a state to perceive, _i.e._, only what\r\nis directly connected with the events. If the description includes\r\nextraneous matter, it is psychologically false; it disturbs moods,\r\ninterrupts events, diverts the attention from what ought to be the\r\nessential point in the work of art, and transforms the latter into a\r\npatchwork; showing signs that its author lacked artistic earnestness,\r\nthat the work is not born from the need to give poetic expression to a\r\ngenuine emotion.\r\n\r\nA very much worse error than desultory, cold-blooded description\r\nin imaginative writing is impressionism. In painting it has its\r\nauthorization. The latter reproduces the impressions of the visual\r\nsenses, and the painter is within the limits of his art when he\r\npresents his purely optical perceptions without composing, or without\r\nrelating a story, _i.e._, without introducing any idea into the scene\r\nhe reproduces, without combining any activity of his highest centres of\r\nideation with the activity of the centres of perception. The picture\r\nproduced according to this method will be very inferior from an\r\næsthetic point of view, but it will be a picture, and can be defended\r\nas such. Poetical impressionism, on the other hand, is a complete\r\nmisconception of the essence of imaginative work; it is the negation\r\nand suppression of it. The medium of poetry is language. Now this is\r\nan activity, not of the centres of perception, but of the centres of\r\nideation and judgment. The immediate phonetic reaction upon sensory\r\nexcitations is merely an exclamation. Without the co-operation of the\r\nhighest centres a perception cannot express itself phonetically except\r\nby an ‘Ah!’ or an ‘Oh!’ But in the same ratio that the purely emotional\r\ncry of an animal rises to the height of intelligible grammatically\r\narticulated human speech, the purely sensuous perception rises also to\r\nthe height of concept and judgment, and it is psychologically quite\r\nfalse so to depict the language of the external world as if it set free\r\nonly a sensation of colour or of sound, and provoked neither ideas,\r\nconcepts, nor judgments. Impressionism in literature is an example of\r\nthat atavism which we have noticed as the most distinctive feature\r\nin the mental life of degenerates. It carries back the human mind to\r\nits brute-beginnings, and the artistic activity of its present high\r\ndifferentiation to an embryonic state; that state in which all the arts\r\n(which were later to emerge and diverge) lay side by side inchoate and\r\ninseparate. Consider, as an example, these impressionist descriptions\r\nby the brothers De Goncourt: ‘Above it a great cloud lowered, a heavy\r\nmass of a sombre purple, a scud from the north.... This cloud rose and\r\nended in sharp rents against a brightness where pale green merged\r\ninto rose. Then the sky became dull, of the colour of tin, swept by\r\nfragments of other gray clouds.... Beyond the softly-swaying pinetops,\r\nunder which the broad garden walk could be seen bare, leafless, red,\r\nalmost carmine, ... the eye took in the whole space between the dome\r\nof the Salpétrière and the mass of the Observatory; first, a great\r\nplane of shadow resembling a wash of Indian ink on a red ground, a\r\nzone of warm bituminous tones, burnt with those frost-touched reds and\r\nthose wintry glows that are found on an English artist’s water-colour\r\npalette; then, in the infinite delicacy of a degraded tint, a whitish\r\nstreak arose, a milky nacreous vapour, pierced by the bright tones of\r\nnew buildings.’ ‘The delicate tones of an old man’s complexion played\r\non the yellowish and bluish pink of his face. Through his tender,\r\nwrinkled ears--ears of paper interwoven by filaments--the day in\r\npassing became orange.’ ‘The air, streaked with water, had an over-wash\r\nof that violet blue with which the painter imitates the transparency\r\nof thick glass.... The first vivid smile of green began on the black\r\nbranches of the trees, where, like strokes from a brush, touches of\r\nspring could be discerned leaving behind it light coatings of green\r\ndust.’[437]\r\n\r\nSuch is the procedure of impressionism. The writer gives himself the\r\nair of a painter; he professes to seize the phenomenon, not as a\r\nconcept, but to feel it as simple sense-stimulation. He writes down the\r\nnames of colours as an artist lays on his washes, and he imagines that\r\nhe has herewith given the reader a particularly strong impression of\r\nreality. But it is a childish illusion, for the reader, nevertheless,\r\ncomes to see no colours, but merely words. He has to transform these\r\nnames of colours, like every other word, into images, and with the same\r\nmental effort he would procure himself a much livelier impression if,\r\ninstead of heavily enumerating to him one after another of the optical\r\nelements of the phenomenon, the phenomenon were presented to him ready\r\nelaborated into a concept. M. Zola has borrowed this absurdity from\r\nthe De Goncourt brothers with some exactitude, but it was not he who\r\ninvented it.\r\n\r\nAnother of his originalities is said to be the observation and\r\nreproduction of the _milieu_, the environment, human and material,\r\nof the persons represented. Coming after the indulgence in useless\r\ndescription, and after impressionism, the theory of the ‘milieu’\r\nproduces a most comical effect, since it is the exact contrary of\r\nthe psychological theory which forms the point of departure of\r\nimpressionism and of the mania for description. The impressionist\r\nplaces himself over against some phenomenon as a mere sense, as\r\nphotographer or phonographist, etc. He registers the nerve-vibrations.\r\nHe denies himself all higher comprehension, the elaboration of\r\nperceptions into concepts, and the classification of the concepts\r\nin the experiences which, as general knowledge, pre-exist in his\r\nconsciousness. The theorist of the ‘milieu,’ on the contrary,\r\nsystematically attributes the chief importance, not to the phenomenon,\r\nbut to its causal connection; he is not a sense which perceives, but\r\na philosopher who endeavours to interpret and explain according to a\r\nsystem. What, in fact, does the theory of the ‘milieu’ mean? It means\r\nthat the imaginative writer asserts that the individuality and mode\r\nof conduct of any person are a consequence of the influences that his\r\nenvironment, living or dead, exert upon him, and that he is trying\r\nto discover these influences, and the nature of their action on that\r\nperson. The theory in itself is right, but, again, it is not M. Zola\r\nwho invented it, for it is as old as philosophic thought itself. In\r\nour own times, Taine has distinctly conceived and established it,\r\nand, long before M. Zola, Balzac and Flaubert sought to introduce its\r\noperation into their novels. And yet this theory, extremely fertile as\r\nit is in anthropology and sociology, and giving, as it does, an impulse\r\nto meritorious research, is in imaginative writing but another error,\r\nand constitutes a confusion of kinds engendered by vague thought. The\r\ntask of the man of science is to investigate the causes of phenomena.\r\nSometimes he finds them, frequently he does not; often he believes he\r\nhas discovered them, till more exact observation subsequently tells\r\nhim he has deceived himself and must rectify his hypotheses. The\r\ninvestigation of the conditions under which man acquires his various\r\nphysical and mental qualities is in full progress, but is only at its\r\ncommencement, and has as yet furnished extremely few positive facts.\r\nWe do not even know why one human race is tall or another short in\r\nstature; why this one has blue eyes and fair hair, that one dark\r\neyes and hair; and yet these are incomparably simpler, more external\r\nand more accessible properties than the subtle peculiarities of mind\r\nand character. On the causes of these peculiarities we know nothing\r\ndefinite. We can make conjectures on this subject, but, meanwhile, even\r\nthe most plausible of these have still the character of hypotheses, of\r\nprobable, but not of verified, truth. And here the imaginative writer\r\nwould like to come upon the scene, carry off unfinished scientific\r\nhypotheses, complete them by means of his own fantastic conceits,\r\nand teach: ‘Do you see? this man whom I show you has become what he\r\nis because his parents have had such and such attributes, because he\r\nhas lived here or there, because when a child he received such and\r\nsuch impressions, because he has been thus nurtured, thus educated,\r\nhas had such and such intercourse, etc.’ He is here doing what is\r\nnot his office. Instead of an artistic creation he attempts to give\r\nus science, and he gives us false science, since he has no suspicion\r\nof the influences which really form the man, and the details of the\r\n‘milieu’ which he throws into relief as being the causes of individual\r\npeculiarities are probably the least essential, and, in any case, only\r\na minimum portion of what, in the formation of the personality, has\r\nplayed a really determining part. Think of it for a moment. The one\r\nquestion as to the origin of the criminal has produced in these last\r\ntwenty years thousands of books and pamphlets; hundreds of medical men,\r\njurists, economists, and philosophers of the first rank, have devoted\r\nto it the most profound and assiduous research, and we are still far\r\nfrom being able to indicate with certainty what share heredity, social\r\ninfluences (_i.e._, the ‘milieu,’ properly so called) and unknown\r\nbiological peculiarities of the individual, have in the formation of\r\nthe criminal type. And then there comes a wholly ignorant writer,\r\nwho, quite by himself, with the sovereign infallibility claimed for\r\nhimself by the author in his own province, decides a question which\r\nthe combined ten years’ labour of a whole generation of professional\r\ninvestigators has brought but very little nearer to a solution! This is\r\nan audacity only explicable by this fact, that the writer has not the\r\nvery smallest idea of the weight of the task which he undertakes with\r\nso light a heart.\r\n\r\nIf, in spite of this, Balzac and Flaubert seem to have produced\r\nexcellent works with this theory of the ‘milieu,’ it is an optical\r\nillusion. They have devoted great attention and detailed descriptions\r\nto the environment of their characters (especially Flaubert in _Madame\r\nBovary_), and the superficial reader thereby receives the impression\r\nthat there exists a connection of causality between the environment\r\nand the being and doing of the personages, it being one of the most\r\nelementary and tenacious peculiarities of human thought to link\r\ncausally one with another all phenomena which present themselves\r\nsimultaneously or successively. This peculiarity is one of the most\r\nfruitful sources of defective conclusions, and it cannot be overcome\r\nexcept by the most attentive observation, often even only with the help\r\nof experiment. In the novels of Balzac and Flaubert, where the ‘milieu’\r\nplays so great a part, the ‘milieu,’ in fact, explains nothing. For the\r\npersonages who move in the same ‘milieu’ are, notwithstanding, wholly\r\ndifferent. Everyone reacts on the influences of the ‘milieu’ in his\r\nown particular way. This distinctive character must be the datum, it\r\ncannot be the result, of the ‘milieu.’ The latter has, at most, the\r\nsignificance of an immediate proximate cause, but the most remote\r\ncauses of the effect in question are found in the distinctive character\r\nof the personality, and on the latter, the ‘milieu’ that the poet\r\ndepicts gives us no real enlightenment.\r\n\r\nOn the pretension of M. Zola and his partisans, that his novels\r\nare ‘slices from real life’ (_tranches de vie_), it is useless to\r\nlinger. We have seen above that M. Zola is far from being capable\r\nof transcribing in his novels life as real and as a whole. Like all\r\nthe imaginative writers before him, he also makes a choice; from a\r\nmillion thoughts of his personages, he reproduces one only; from\r\nten thousand functions and actions, one only; from years of their\r\nlife, some minutes, or merely seconds; his supposed ‘slice from\r\nlife’ is a condensed and rearranged conspectus of life, artificially\r\nordered according to a definite design, and full of gaps. Like all\r\nother imaginative writers, he also makes his choice according to his\r\nparticular personal inclinations, and the only difference is that these\r\ninclinations, which we shall at once recognise, are very dissimilar\r\nfrom those of other writers.\r\n\r\nM. Zola calls his novels ‘human documents’ and ‘experimental novels.’\r\nI have already, thirteen years ago, expressed myself so fully on this\r\ndouble pretension, that I have now nothing more to add to what I\r\nsaid then. Does he think that his novels are serious documents from\r\nwhich science can borrow facts? What childish folly! Science can have\r\nnothing to do with fiction. She has no need of invented persons and\r\nactions, however _ben trovati_ they may be; but she wants beings who\r\nhave lived, and actions which have taken place. The novel treats of\r\nindividual destinies, or at most those of families; science has need\r\nof information on the destinies of millions. Police reports, lists\r\nof imposts, tables of commerce, statistics of crimes and suicides,\r\ninformation on the prices of provisions, salaries, the mean duration\r\nof human life, the marriage rate, the birth rate, legitimate and\r\nillegitimate--these are ‘human documents.’ From them we learn how\r\npeople live, whether they progress, whether they are happy or unhappy,\r\npure or corrupt. The history of civilization, when it wants facts,\r\nputs M. Zola’s entertaining novels aside as of no account, and has\r\nrecourse to tedious statistical tables. And a very much more singular\r\nwhim still is his ‘experimental novel.’ This term would prove that M.\r\nZola, if he employs it in good faith, does not even suspect the nature\r\nof scientific experiment. He thinks he has made an experiment when he\r\ninvents neuropathic personages, places them in imaginary conditions,\r\nand makes them perform imaginary actions. A scientific experiment is\r\nan intelligent question addressed to Nature, and to which Nature must\r\nreply, and not the questioner himself. M. Zola also puts questions.\r\nBut to whom? To Nature? No; to his own imagination. And his answers\r\nare to have the force of proof. The result of scientific experiment is\r\nconstraining. Every man in possession of his senses can perceive it.\r\nThe results at which M. Zola arrives in his pretended ‘experiment’ do\r\nnot exist objectively; they exist only in his imagination; they are\r\nnot facts, but assertions, in which every man can believe, or not, at\r\nhis pleasure. The difference between experiments, and what M. Zola\r\ncalls such, is so great that it is difficult for me to impute the\r\nabusive application of the term to ignorance only, or to incapacity\r\nfor thought. I believe rather in a conscious premeditated snare. The\r\nappearance of M. Zola occurred at a time when mysticism was not yet the\r\nfashion in France, and when the favourite catch-words of the writing\r\nand gossiping gang were positivism and natural science. In order to\r\nrecommend himself to the masses, a man had to represent himself as a\r\npositivist and as scientific. Grocers, hotel-keepers, small inventors,\r\netc., have everywhere and always the habit of decorating their\r\nsign-boards or their produce with a name which is connected with an\r\nidea dominant with the public. At the present day a hotel-keeper or\r\na tradesman recommends his house or his shop by such titles as ‘The\r\nProgress’ or ‘International Commerce;’ and a manufacturer extols his\r\ngoods as ‘Electric’ braces or ‘Magnetic’ ink. We have seen that the\r\nNietzscheans designate their tendency as ‘psycho-physiological.’ In\r\nthe same way Zola long before them hung out the catch-word sign to his\r\nnovels--‘Y^e scientificke experimente.’ But his novels had no more\r\nvisible connection with natural science and experiment than the ink\r\nabove mentioned with magnetism, and the braces with electricity.\r\n\r\nM. Zola boasts of his method of work; all his books emanate from\r\n‘observation.’ The truth is that he has never ‘observed;’ that he has\r\nnever, following Goethe, ‘plunged into the full tide of human life,’\r\nbut has always remained shut up in a world of paper, and has drawn\r\nall his subjects out of his own brain, all his ‘realistic’ details\r\nfrom newspapers and books read uncritically. I need only recall a few\r\ncases in which his sources have been placed within his reach. All the\r\ninformation on the life, manners, habits, and language of the Parisian\r\nworkmen in _L’Assommoir_ are borrowed from a study by M. Denis Poulot,\r\n_Le Sublime_. The adventure of _Une Page d’Amour_ is taken from the\r\n_Mémoires de Casanova_. Certain features in which the masochism or\r\npassivism of Count Muffat is declared in _Nana_, M. Zola found in a\r\nquotation from Taine relative to the _Venice Preserved_ of Thomas\r\nOtway.[438] The scene of the confinement, in _La Joie de Vivre_, the\r\ndescription of the Mass, in _La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret_, etc., are\r\ncopied word for word from an obstetric manual and a Mass-book. One\r\nreads sometimes in the newspapers very pretentious statements of the\r\n‘studies’ to which M. Zola gives himself up when he undertakes a new\r\nnovel. These ‘studies’ consist, on his part, in making a visit to the\r\nBourse when he wishes to write on speculation, in undertaking a trip\r\non a locomotive when he desires to describe the working of a railway,\r\nin once casting a glance round some available bedroom when he means\r\nto depict the mode of life of the Parisian _cocottes_. Such a manner\r\nof ‘observation’ resembles that of a traveller who passes through a\r\ncountry in an express train. He may perceive some external details, he\r\nmay notice some scenes and arrange them later in descriptions rich in\r\ncolour, if wholly inaccurate; but he learns nothing of the real and\r\nessential peculiarities of the country, and the life and ways of its\r\ninhabitants. Like all degenerates, M. Zola, too, is a complete stranger\r\nto the world in which he lives. His eyes are never directed towards\r\nnature or humanity, but only to his own ‘Ego.’ He has no first-hand\r\nknowledge of anything, but acquires, by second or third hand, all that\r\nhe knows of the world or life. Flaubert has created, in _Bouvard et\r\nPécuchet_, the characters of two blockheads, who, with unsuspecting\r\ningenuousness, attack all the arts and sciences, and imagine they have\r\nacquired them when they have dipped into, or, more correctly, have\r\nskimmed through, the first book on the subject which falls into their\r\nhands. Zola is an ‘observer’ of the Bouvard et Pécuchet species, and on\r\nreading Flaubert’s posthumous novel one is tempted to believe in places\r\nthat when describing the ‘studies’ of his heroes he was thinking, at\r\nleast amongst others, of Zola.\r\n\r\nI think I have shown that M. Zola has not the priority in any one of\r\nthe peculiarities which constitute his method. For all of them he\r\nhas had models, and some few are as old as the world. The supposed\r\nrealism, mania for description, impressionism, the emphasis on the\r\n‘milieu,’ the human document, the slices of life--all these are so many\r\næsthetic and psychological errors, but Zola has not even the doubtful\r\nmerit of having conceived them. The only thing he has invented is the\r\nword ‘naturalism,’ substituted by him for ‘realism’ (the sole term\r\nin vogue till then), and the expression ‘experimental novel,’ which\r\nmeans absolutely nothing, but possesses a piquant little smattering of\r\nscience which Zola’s public, at the period when this novelist made his\r\nappearance, felt as an agreeable seasoning.\r\n\r\nThe only real and true things contained in M. Zola’s novels are the\r\nlittle traits borrowed by him from the items of news in the daily\r\npapers and from technical works. But these also become false from the\r\nlack of criticism and taste with which he employs them. In fact, in\r\norder that the borrowed detail should remain faithful to reality, it\r\nmust preserve its right relation to the whole phenomenon, and this\r\nis what never happens with M. Zola. To quote only two examples. In\r\n_Pot-Bouille_, among the inhabitants of a single house in the Rue\r\nde Choiseul, he brings to pass in the space of a few months all the\r\ninfamous things he has learnt in the course of thirty years, by reports\r\nfrom his acquaintances, by cases in courts of law, and various facts\r\nfrom newspapers about apparently honourable bourgeois families; in\r\n_La Terre_, all the vices imputed to the French peasantry or rustic\r\npeople in general, he crams into the character and conduct of a few\r\ninhabitants of a small village in Beauce; he may in these cases have\r\nsupported every detail by cuttings from newspapers or jottings, but the\r\nwhole is not the less monstrously and ridiculously untrue.\r\n\r\nThe self-styled innovator who, it is asserted, has invented hitherto\r\nunknown methods of construction and exposition in the province of the\r\nnovel, is in reality a pupil of the French romanticists, from whom he\r\nhas appropriated and employed all the tricks of the trade, and whose\r\ntradition he carries on, walking in the straight road of historical\r\ncontinuity, without interruption and without deviation. This is what\r\nis most clearly proved by the descriptions, which reflect not the\r\nworld, but the view that the poet is capable of taking of the world. I\r\nwill quote, for the sake of comparison, some characteristic passages\r\nfrom _Notre Dame de Paris_, by Victor Hugo, and from different novels\r\nby Zola, which will show the reader that both could be very easily\r\nconfounded, the self-styled inventor of ‘naturalism’ and the extreme\r\nromanticist. ‘The broom ransacked the corners with an irritated\r\ngrowling.’ ‘The Kyrie Eleison ran like a shiver into this kind of\r\nstable.’ ‘The pulpit ... stood in front of a clock with weights,\r\nenclosed in a walnut wood case, and the hollow vibrations of which\r\nshook the whole church, like the beatings of an enormous heart,\r\nhidden somewhere beneath the flag-stones.’ ‘The rays [of the sun],\r\nmore and more horizontal, withdraw slowly from the pavement of the\r\nsquare, and mount perpendicularly along the gabled front, making its\r\nthousand bas-reliefs spring out from their shadow, while the great\r\ncentral rose-window blazes like a Cyclop’s eye inflamed by the glow\r\nof the forge.’ ‘When the priest ... quitted the altar ... the sun\r\nremained sole master of the church. It had rested in its turn on the\r\naltar cloth, illuminated the door of the tabernacle with splendour,\r\ncelebrating the fruitful promise of May. A warmth arose from the\r\nflag-stones. The whitewashed walls, the great Virgin, the great Christ\r\nhimself, took on a shiver of vital sap [!], as if death had been\r\nvanquished by the eternal youth of the earth.’ ‘In a crevice of this\r\nspout two pretty gilliflowers in blossom, shaken and animated by the\r\nbreath of the air, made sportive salutations to each other.’ ‘At one of\r\nthe windows a great service-tree reared itself, throwing its branches\r\nacross the broken panes, extending its shoots as if to look within.’\r\n‘Towards the east, the morning breeze chased some white flocks of\r\ndown across the sky, torn from the foggy fleece of the hills.’ ‘The\r\nclosed windows slept. Some few, here and there, brightly lit, opened\r\ntheir eyes, and seemed to make certain corners squint.’ ‘Already some\r\nwhiffs of smoke were disgorged here and there over all that surface of\r\nroofs, as by the fissures of an immense sulphur-kiln.’ ‘A miserable\r\nguillotine, furtive, uneasy, ashamed, which seems always afraid of\r\nbeing caught _in flagrante delicto_, so quickly does it disappear after\r\nhaving given its blow.’ ‘The alembic went on dully, without a flame, or\r\nany gaiety in the extinct reflexions of its coppers, letting flow its\r\nalcoholic sweat, like a slow and obstinate spring, which should end by\r\ninvading the rooms, spreading over the boulevards without inundating\r\nthe immense hollow of Paris.’ ‘At the barrier, the herd-like trampling\r\nwent on in the cold of the morning.... This crowd, from a distance, was\r\na chalky blur, a neutral tone, in which a faded blue and dirty gray\r\npredominated. Occasionally, a workman stopped short ... while around\r\nhim the others walked on, without a smile, without a word to a comrade,\r\nwith cadaverous cheeks, faces turned towards Paris, which, one by one,\r\ndevoured them by the gaping street of the Faubourg Poissonnière.’ ‘And\r\nthen, as he dived farther into the street, legless cripples, blind\r\nand lame men multiplied around him; the one-armed and the one-eyed,\r\nand the lepers with their wounds, some coming from the houses, some\r\nfrom the adjacent small streets, some from the air-holes of cellars,\r\nhowling, bellowing, screaming, all limpingly, lamely, rushing towards\r\nthe light, and wallowing in the mire like snails after rain.’ ‘The\r\nsquare ... presented ... the appearance of a sea, in which five or six\r\nstreets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged new waves of heads\r\nat every instant.... The great stairs, ascended and descended without\r\nintermission by a double stream ... flowed incessantly into the square,\r\nlike a cascade into a lake.’ ‘The flickering brightness of the flames\r\nmade them appear to move. There were serpents which had the appearance\r\nof laughing, gargoyles that one seemed to hear yelping, salamanders\r\nwhich breathed in the fire, dragons which sneezed in the smoke.’ ‘And\r\nthe steam-engine, ten paces off, went on steadily breathing, steadily\r\nspitting from its scorched metal throat.’ ‘These were no longer the\r\ncold windows of the morning; now they appeared as if warmed and\r\nvibrating with internal tremor. There were people looking at them,\r\nwomen, standing still, squeezing against the plate-glass, quite a crowd\r\nbrutalized by covetousness. And the stuffs seemed alive in this passion\r\nof the pavement: the laces shivered, fell back and hid the depths of\r\nthe shop, with a disquieting air of mystery.’ It would be easy to\r\nextend these comparisons to some hundreds of pages. I have indulged in\r\nthe little joke of not adding the author’s name to the passages quoted.\r\nBy the nature of the object described the specially attentive reader\r\nwill perhaps be able to guess in one or another of these quotations,\r\nwhether they are from Victor Hugo or from Emile Zola; I have tried to\r\nfacilitate the matter by borrowing the passages by Victor Hugo from the\r\n_Notre Dame de Paris_ alone; but the greatest number he will certainly\r\nnot know to whom to attribute until I tell him that examples three,\r\nfive, seven, nine, ten, thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen, are from\r\nVictor Hugo, and all the others from Zola.\r\n\r\nThis is because the latter is an out-and-out romanticist in his way\r\nof envisaging the world and in his artistic method. He constantly\r\npractises in the most extensive and intensive fashion that atavistic\r\nanthropomorphism and symbolism, consequent on undeveloped or mystically\r\nconfused thought, which is found among savages in a natural form, and\r\namong the whole category of degenerates in an atavistic form of mental\r\nactivity. Like Victor Hugo, and like second-class romanticists, M. Zola\r\nsees every phenomenon monstrously magnified and weirdly distorted. It\r\nbecomes for him, as for the savage, a fetish to which he attributes\r\nevil and hostile designs. Machines are horrible monsters dreaming of\r\ndestruction; the streets of Paris open the jaws of Moloch to devour\r\nthe human masses; a _magasin de modes_ is an alarming, supernaturally\r\npowerful being, panting, fascinating, stifling, etc. Criticism has\r\nlong since declared, though without comprehending the psychiatrical\r\nsignificance of this trait, that in every one of M. Zola’s novels\r\nsome phenomenon dominates, like an obsession, forms the main feature\r\nof the work, and penetrates, like an appalling symbol, into the\r\nlife and actions of all the characters. Thus, in _L’Assommoir_, the\r\nstill; in _Pot-Bouille_, the ‘solemn staircase’; in _Au Bonheur des\r\nDames_, the draper’s shop; in _Nana_, the heroine herself, who is\r\nno ordinary harlot, but ‘_je ne sais quel monstre géant à la croupe\r\ngonflée de vices, une enorme Vénus populaire, aussi lourdement bête\r\nque grossièrement impudique, une espèce d’idole hindoue qui n’a\r\nseulement qu’à laisser tomber ses voiles pour faire tomber en arrêt\r\nles vieillards et les collégiens, et qui, par instants, se sent\r\nelle-même planer sur Paris et sur le monde_.’[439] This symbolism we\r\nhave encountered among all degenerates, among symbolists properly so\r\ncalled, and other mystics, as well as among diabolists, and principally\r\nin Ibsen. It never fails in the madness of doubt or negation.[440]\r\nThe would-be ‘realist’ sees the sober reality as little as a\r\nsuperstitiously timid savage, or a lunatic afflicted by hallucinations.\r\nHe puts into it his own mental dispositions. He disposes of phenomena\r\narbitrarily, so that they appear to express an idea which is\r\ndominating him. He gives to inanimate objects a fantastic life, and\r\nmetamorphoses them into so many goblins endowed with feeling, will,\r\ncunning and ideas; but of human beings he makes automata through whom\r\na mysterious power declares itself, a fatality in the ancient sense, a\r\nforce of Nature, a principle of destruction. His endless descriptions\r\ndelineate nothing but his own mental condition. No image of reality\r\nis ever obtained by them, for the picture of the world is to him like\r\na freshly varnished oil-painting to which one stands too close in a\r\ndisadvantageous light, and in which the reflection of one’s own face\r\nmay be discerned.\r\n\r\nM. Zola calls his series of novels ‘The Natural and Social History\r\nof a Family under the Second Empire,’ and he seeks in this way to\r\nawaken the double idea that the Rougon-Macquarts are a typical average\r\nfamily of the French middle class, and that their history represents\r\nthe general social life of France in the time of Napoleon III. He\r\nexpressly asserts, as the fundamental principle of art, that the\r\nnovelist should only relate the everyday life observed by himself.[441]\r\nI allowed myself for thirteen years to be led astray by his swagger,\r\nand credulously accepted his novels as sociological contributions to\r\nthe knowledge of French life. Now I know better. The family whose\r\nhistory Zola presents to us in twenty mighty volumes is entirely\r\noutside normal daily life, and has no necessary connection whatever\r\nwith France and the Second Empire. It might just as well have lived in\r\nPatagonia, and at the time of the Thirty Years’ War. He who ridicules\r\nthe ‘idealists’ as being narrators of ‘exceptional cases,’ of that\r\nwhich ‘never happened,’ has chosen for the subject of his _magnum opus_\r\nthe most exceptional case he could possibly have found--a group of\r\ndegenerates, lunatics, criminals, prostitutes, and ‘mattoids,’ whose\r\nmorbid nature places them apart from the species; who do not belong\r\nto a regular society, but are expelled from it, and at strife with\r\nit; who conduct themselves as complete strangers to their epoch and\r\ncountry, and are, by their manner of existence, not members of any\r\nmodern civilized people whatever, but belong to a horde of primitive\r\nwild men of bygone ages. M. Zola affirms that he describes life as\r\nhe has observed it, and persons he has seen. He has in reality seen\r\nnothing and observed nothing, but has drawn the idea of his _magnum\r\nopus_, all the details of his plan, all the characters of his twenty\r\nnovels, solely from one printed source, remaining hitherto unknown\r\nto all his critics, a characteristic circumstance due to the fact\r\nthat not one of them possesses the least knowledge of the literature\r\nof mental therapeutics. There is in France a family of the name of\r\nKérangal, who came originally from Saint-Brieuc, in Brittany, and whose\r\nhistory has for the last sixty years filled the annals of criminal\r\njustice and mental therapeutics. In two generations it has hitherto\r\nproduced, to the knowledge of the authorities, seven murderers and\r\nmurderesses, nine persons who have led an immoral life (one the keeper\r\nof a disorderly house, one a prostitute who was at the same time an\r\nincendiary, committed incest, and was condemned for a public outrage on\r\nmodesty, etc.), and besides all these, a painter, a poet, an architect,\r\nan actress, several who were blind, and one musician.[442] The history\r\nof this Kérangal family has supplied M. Zola with material for all\r\nhis novels. What would never have been afforded him in the life he\r\nreally knows he found ready to his hand in the police and medical\r\nreports on the Kérangals, viz., an abundant assortment of the most\r\nexecrable crimes, the most unheard-of adventures, and the maddest and\r\nmost disordered careers, permeated by artistic inclinations which make\r\nthe whole particularly piquant. If any common fabricator of newspaper\r\nnovels had had the luck to discover the treasure he would probably\r\nhave made a hash of the subject. M. Zola, with his great power and his\r\nsombre emotionalism, has known how to profit very effectively by it.\r\nNevertheless, the subject he broaches is the _roman du colportage_,\r\n_i.e._, of a perishing romanticism which transports his dreams into\r\nno palaces like the flourishing romanticism, but into dens, prisons,\r\nand lunatic asylums, which are quite as far from the middle stratum\r\nof sane life as the latter, only in an opposite direction, tending\r\nnot upwards, but downwards. But if M. Zola has infinitely more talent\r\nthan the German romanticists, to whom we owe such works as _Rinaldo\r\nRinaldini_, _Die blutige Nonne um Mitternacht_, _Der Scharfrichter\r\nvom Schreckenstein_, etc., he has, on the other hand, infinitely less\r\nhonesty than they. For they, at least, admit that they relate the most\r\nmarvellous and unique horrors of their kind, while Zola issues his\r\nchronicles of criminals and madmen, the fruits of his reading, as a\r\nnormal account of French society, drawn from the observation of daily\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBy choosing his subject in the domain of the most extraordinary\r\nand most exceptional, by the childish or crazy symbolism and\r\nanthropomorphism displayed in his extremely unreal survey of the world,\r\nthe ‘realist’ Zola proves himself to be the immediate descendant in\r\na direct line of the romanticists. His works are distinguished from\r\nthose of his literary ancestors by only two peculiarities, which M.\r\nBrunetière has well discerned, viz., by ‘pessimism and premeditated\r\ncoarseness.’[443] These peculiarities of M. Zola furnish us finally\r\nwith a characteristic sign also of so-called realism or naturalism,\r\nwhich we should have in vain attempted to discover by psychological,\r\næsthetic, historical, and literary inquiries. Naturalism, which has\r\nnothing to do with Nature or reality, is, taken all in all, the\r\npremeditated worship of pessimism and obscenity.\r\n\r\nPessimism, as a philosophy, is the last remains of the superstition of\r\nprimitive times, which looked upon man as the centre and end of the\r\nuniverse. It is one of the philosophic forms of ego-mania. All the\r\nobjections of pessimist philosophers to Nature and life have but one\r\nmeaning, if their premise be correct as to the sovereignty of man in\r\nthe Cosmos. When the philosopher says, Nature is irrational, Nature is\r\nimmoral, Nature is cruel, what is this, in other words, but: I do not\r\nunderstand Nature, and yet she is only there that I may understand her;\r\nNature does not consider what is for my utility alone, and yet she has\r\nno other task than to be useful to me; Nature grants me but a short\r\nperiod of existence, often crossed by troubles, and yet it is her duty\r\nto make provision for the eternity of my life and my continual joys?\r\nWhen Oscar Wilde is indignant that Nature makes no difference between\r\nhimself and the grazing ox, we smile at his childishness. But have\r\nSchopenhauer, Hartmann, Mainländer, Bahnsen, done anything more than\r\ninflate into thick books Oscar Wilde’s ingenuous self-conceit? and that\r\nwith terrible seriousness. Philosophic pessimism has the geocentric\r\nconception of the world as its postulate. It stands and falls with\r\nthe Ptolemaic doctrine. As soon as we recognise the Copernican point\r\nof view we lose the right, and also the desire to apply to Nature the\r\nmeasure of our logic, our morals, and our own advantage, and there\r\nceases to be any meaning in calling it irrational, immoral, or cruel.\r\n\r\nBut what is also true is that pessimism is not a philosophy, but a\r\ntemperament. ‘The systemic or organic sensations which arise from the\r\nsimultaneous states of the several organs, digestive, respiratory,\r\netc.,’ says Professor James Sully, ‘appear, as Professor Ferrier\r\nhas lately pointed out, to be the basis of our emotional life. When\r\nthe condition of these organs is a healthy one, and their functions\r\nvigorous, the psychical result is an undiscriminated mass of agreeable\r\nfeeling. When the state of the organs is unhealthy, and their\r\nfunctions feeble or impeded, the psychical result is a similar mass of\r\ndisagreeable feeling.’[444] Pessimism is always the form under which\r\nthe patient becomes conscious of certain morbid conditions, and first\r\nand foremost of his nervous exhaustion. _Tædium vitæ_, or disgust of\r\nlife, is an early premonition of insanity, and constantly accompanies\r\nneurasthenia and hysteria. It is evident that a period which suffers\r\nfrom general organic fatigue must necessarily be a pessimistic period.\r\nWe recognise also the constant habit which consciousness has of\r\ninventing, _post facto_, apparently plausible motives, borrowed from\r\nits store of representations, and in conformity with the rules of its\r\nformal logic, to justify the emotional states of which it has acquired\r\nthe knowledge. Thus, for the datum of the pessimistic disposition\r\nof mind, which is the consequence of organic fatigue, there arises\r\nthe pessimist philosophy as an ulterior creation of interpretative\r\nconsciousness. In Germany, in conformity with the speculative tendency\r\nand high intellectual culture of the German people, this state of\r\nmind has sought expression in philosophical systems. In France it has\r\nadopted an artistic form in accordance with the predominating æsthetic\r\ncharacter of the national mind. M. Emile Zola and his naturalism are\r\nthe French equivalent of the German Schopenhauer and his philosophical\r\npessimism. That naturalism should see nothing in the world but\r\nbrutality, infamy, ugliness, and corruption, corresponds with all\r\nthat we know of the laws of thought. We know that the association\r\nof ideas is strongly influenced by emotion. A Zola, filled from the\r\noutset with organically unpleasant sensations, perceives in the world\r\nthose phenomena alone which accord with his organically fundamental\r\ndisposition, and does not notice or take into consideration those which\r\ndiffer from or contradict it. And from the associated ideas which\r\nevery perception awakens in him, consciousness likewise only retains\r\nthe disagreeable, which are in sympathy with the fundamentally sour\r\ndisposition, and suppresses the others. Zola’s novels do not prove that\r\nthings are badly managed in this world, but merely that Zola’s nervous\r\nsystem is out of order.\r\n\r\nHis predilection also for coarseness is a well-known morbid phenomenon.\r\n‘They’ (the imbeciles), says Sollier, ‘love to talk of obscenities....\r\nThis is a peculiar tendency of mind observable specially among\r\ndegenerates; it is as natural to them as a wholesome “tone” is\r\nto normal minds.’[445] Gilles de la Tourette has coined the word\r\n‘coprolalia’ (mucktalk) for obsessional explosions of blasphemies and\r\nobscenities which characterize a malady described most exhaustively\r\nby M. Catrou, and called by him ‘disease of convulsive tics.’[446]\r\nM. Zola is affected by coprolalia to a very high degree. It is a\r\nnecessity for him to employ foul expressions, and his consciousness is\r\ncontinually pursued by representations referring to ordure, abdominal\r\nfunctions, and everything connected with them. Andreas Verga described\r\nsome years ago a form of onomatomania, or word-madness, which he\r\ncalled _mania blasphematoria_, or oath-madness. It is manifested when\r\nthe patient experiences an irresistible desire to utter curses or\r\nblasphemies. Verga’s diagnosis applies completely to Zola. It can only\r\nbe interpreted as _mania blasphematoria_, when in _La Terre_ he gives\r\nthe nickname of Jesus Christ to a creature afflicted with flatulency,\r\nand that without any artistic necessity or any aiming thereby at\r\næsthetic effect either of cheerfulness or of local colour. Finally, he\r\nhas a striking predilection for slang, for the professional language of\r\nthieves and bullies, etc., which he does not only employ when making\r\npersonages of this kind speak, but makes use of himself, as an author,\r\nin descriptions or reflections. This inclination for slang is expressly\r\nnoticed by Lombroso as an indication of degeneration in the born\r\ncriminal.[447]\r\n\r\nThe confusion of thought which is shown in his theoretic writings,\r\nin his invention of the word ‘naturalism,’ in his conception of\r\nthe ‘experimental novel,’ his instinctive inclination to depict\r\ndemented persons, criminals, prostitutes, and semi-maniacs,[448] his\r\nanthropomorphism and his symbolism, his pessimism, his coprolalia,\r\nand his predilection for slang, sufficiently characterize M. Zola as\r\na high-class degenerate. But he shows in addition some peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic stigmata, which completely establish the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThat he is a sexual psychopath is betrayed on every page of his\r\nnovels. He revels continually in representations from the region of\r\nthe basest sensuality, and interweaves them in all the events of his\r\nnovels without being able in any way to assign an artistic reason for\r\nthis forced introduction. His consciousness is peopled with images of\r\nunnatural vice, bestiality, passivism, and other aberrations, and he\r\nis not satisfied with lingering libidinously over human acts of such\r\na nature, but he even produces pairing animals (see _La Terre_, pp.\r\n9, 10). The sight of a woman’s linen produces a peculiar excitation\r\nin him, and he can never speak without betraying, by the emotional\r\ncolouring of his descriptions, that representations of this kind\r\nare voluptuously accentuated in him. This effect of female linen on\r\ndegenerates affected by sexual psychopathy is well known in mental\r\ntherapeutics, and has often been described by Krafft-Ebing, Lombroso,\r\nand others.[449]\r\n\r\nConnected with the sexual psychopathy of M. Zola is the part played\r\nin him by the olfactory sensations. The predominance of the sense\r\nof smell and its connection with the sexual life is very striking\r\namong many degenerates. Scents acquire a high importance in their\r\nworks. Tolstoi (in _War and Peace_) represents to us Prince Pierre\r\nsuddenly deciding on marrying the Princess Hélène when he smells her\r\nfragrance at a ball.[450] In the narrative entitled _The Cossacks_\r\nhe never mentions the uncle Ieroschka without speaking of the smell\r\nhe emitted.[451] We have seen in the previous chapters with what\r\nsatisfaction the Diabolists and Decadents, Baudelaire, Huysmans, etc.,\r\nlingered on odours, and especially on bad odours. M. Barrès makes his\r\nlittle princess say, in _L’Ennemi des Lois_: ‘I go every morning to the\r\nstables. Oh, that little stabley smell, so warm and pleasant! And she\r\ninhaled with a pretty[!] sensual expression....’[452] M. de Goncourt\r\ndescribes, in _La Faustin_, how the actress lets her Lord Annandale\r\nsmell her bosom: ‘“Smell! What do you smell?” she asked Lord Annandale.\r\n“Why, carnations!” he replied, tasting it with his lips. “And what\r\nelse?” “Your skin!”’[453] M. A. Binet declares that ‘it is the odours\r\nof the human body which are the causes responsible for a certain\r\nnumber of marriages contracted by clever men with female subordinates\r\nbelonging to their households. For certain men, the most essential\r\nthing in a woman is not beauty, mind, or elevation of character; it is\r\nher smell. The pursuit of the beloved odour determines them to pursue\r\nsome ugly, old, vicious, degraded woman. Carried to this point, the\r\npleasure in smell becomes a malady of love’[454]--a malady, I will\r\nadd, from which only the degenerate suffer. The examples that Binet\r\nquotes in the course of his work, and which can be there referred to,\r\nas I have no inclination to repeat them here, prove this abundantly;\r\nand Krafft-Ebing, while insisting on the ‘close connection between\r\nthe sexual and the olfactory sense,’ nevertheless expressly declares:\r\n‘At all events, the perceptions of smell play a very subordinate\r\npart within the physiological limits (_i.e._, within the limits of\r\nthe healthy life).[455] Even after the abstraction of its sexual\r\nsignificance, the development of the sense of smell among degenerates,\r\nnot only of the higher, but even of the lowest type, has struck many\r\nobservers. Séguin speaks of ‘idiots who discriminated species of woods\r\nand stones merely by smell without having recourse to sight, and who,\r\nnevertheless, were not disagreeably affected by the smell and taste of\r\nhuman ordure, and whose sense of touch was obtuse and unequal.’[456]\r\n\r\nM. Zola’s case belongs to this series. He shows at times an unhealthy\r\npredominance of the sensations of smell in his consciousness, and\r\na perversion of the olfactory sense which make the worst odours,\r\nespecially those of all human excretions, appear to him particularly\r\nagreeable and sensually stimulating. The inspector of the Montpellier\r\nAcademy, Leopold Bernard, has taken the trouble, in an elaborate\r\nwork--which, curiously, has remained almost unknown[457]--to bring\r\ntogether all the passages in Zola’s novels which touch on the question\r\nof odours, and to show that men and things do not present themselves to\r\nhim as to normal individuals, viz., in the first instance as optical\r\nand acoustic phenomena, but as olfactory perceptions. He characterizes\r\nall his personages by their smell. In _La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret_,\r\nAlbine appears ‘like a great nosegay of strong scent.’ Serge, at the\r\nseminary, was ‘a lily whose sweet scent charmed his masters’(!!)\r\nDésirée ‘smells of health.’ Nana ‘_dégage une odeur de vie, une\r\ntoute-puissance de femme_.’ In _Pot-Bouille_, Bachelard exhales ‘une\r\nodeur de débauche canaille’; Madame Campardon has ‘a good fresh\r\nperfume of autumn fruit.’ In _Le Ventre de Paris_, Françoise ‘smells\r\nof earth, hay, the open air, the open sky.’ In the same novel the\r\n‘cheese-symphony’ occurs, as celebrated among Zola’s enthusiasts as\r\nthe minute description of the variety of offensive smells of the dirty\r\nlinen in _L’Assommoir_.\r\n\r\nTo the ‘comprehensives’ whom we have learnt to know, this insistence\r\non the odours emitted by men and things is naturally one more merit\r\nand perfection. A poet who scents so well and receives through the\r\nnose such rich impressions of the world, is ‘a more keenly vibrating\r\ninstrument of observation,’ and his art in representing things is more\r\nmany-sided than that of poets who reproduce their impressions from\r\nfewer senses. Why should the sense of smell be neglected in poetry?\r\nHas it not the same rights as all the other senses? And thereupon\r\nthey rapidly built an æsthetic theory which, as we have seen, induces\r\nHuysmans’ Des Esseintes to compose a symphony of perfumes, and prompts\r\nthe Symbolists to accompany the recital of their compositions on the\r\nstage with odours, which they pretend are assorted to the contents of\r\nthe verses. The ‘comprehensive’ drivellers do not for a moment suspect\r\nthat they are simply fencing with the march of organic evolution in\r\nthe animal kingdom. It does not depend on the good pleasure of a being\r\nto construct for himself his idea of the external world with the help\r\nof a group of such or such sense-perceptions. In this respect he is\r\ncompletely subservient to the conformation of his nervous system.\r\nThe senses which predominate are those which his being utilizes in\r\nacquiring knowledge. The undeveloped or insufficiently developed\r\nsenses help the brain little or not at all, to know and understand\r\nthe world. To the vulture and condor the world is a picture; to\r\nthe bat and the mole it is a sound and a tactile sensation; to the\r\ndog it is a collection of smells. Concerning the sense of smell in\r\nparticular, it has its central seat in the so-called olfactory lobe\r\nof the brain, which diminishes in proportion as the frontal lobe is\r\ndeveloped. The more we descend in the vertebrates the greater is the\r\nolfactory, the smaller the frontal, lobe. In man the olfactory lobe is\r\nquite subordinated, and the frontal lobe, the presumable seat of the\r\nhighest mental functions, including language, greatly predominates.\r\nThe consequence of these anatomical relations, which evade our\r\ninfluence, is that the sense of smell has scarcely any further share in\r\nman’s knowledge. He obtains his impressions of the external world no\r\nlonger by the nose, but principally by the eye and ear. The olfactory\r\nperceptions only furnish a minimum contribution to the concepts which\r\nare formed out of ideational elements. It is only in the most limited\r\ndegree that smells can awaken abstract concepts, _i.e._, a higher and\r\ncomplex mental activity, and stimulate their accompanying emotions; a\r\n‘symphony of perfumes’ in the Des Esseintes sense can, therefore, no\r\nlonger give the impression of moral beauty, this being an idea which\r\nis elaborated by the centres of conception. In order to inspire a man\r\nwith logical sequences of ideas and judgments, with abstract concepts\r\nby scents alone; to make him conceive the phenomenon of the world, its\r\nchanges and causes of motion, by a succession of perfumes, his frontal\r\nlobe must be depressed and the olfactory lobe of a dog substituted\r\nfor it, and this, it must be admitted, is beyond the capacity of\r\n‘comprehensive’ imbeciles, however fanatically they may preach their\r\næsthetic folly. Smellers among degenerates represent an atavism going\r\nback, not only to the primeval period of man, but infinitely more\r\nremote still, to an epoch anterior to man. Their atavism retrogrades\r\nto animals amongst whom sexual activity was directly excited by\r\nodoriferous substances, as it is still at the present day in the\r\nmuskdeer, or who, like the dog, obtained their knowledge of the world\r\nby the action of their noses.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary success of Zola among his contemporaries is not\r\nexplained by his high qualifications as an author, that is, by the\r\nextraordinary force and power of his romantic descriptions, and by\r\nthe intensity and truth of his pessimistic emotion, which makes his\r\nrepresentation of suffering and sorrow irresistibly impressive; but\r\nby his worst faults, his triviality and lasciviousness. This can be\r\nproved by the surest of methods, that of figures. Let us consult as\r\nto the diffusion of his different novels, the printed indications,\r\nfor example, at the beginning of the last edition of _L’Assommoir_\r\n(bearing the date 1893). They have been put down as follows: Of _Nana_,\r\n160,000; _La Débâcle_, 143,000; _L’Assommoir_, 127,000; _La Terre_,\r\n100,000; _Germinal_, 88,000; _La Bête humaine_ and _Le Rêve_, each\r\n83,000; _Pot-Bouille_, 82,000; as a contrast, _L’[Œuvre_, 55,000; _La\r\nJoie de Vivre_, 44,000; _La Curée_, 36,000; _La Conquête de Plassans_,\r\n25,000; of the _Contes à Ninon_ not even 2,000 copies, etc. Thus, the\r\nnovels which have had the greatest sale are those in which lust and\r\nbestial coarseness appear most flagrantly, and the demand diminishes\r\nwith mathematical exactitude in proportion as the layer of obscenity,\r\nspread by Zola over his work as with a mason’s trowel, becomes more\r\nthin and less ill-smelling. Three novels appear as an exception to this\r\nrule: _La Débâcle_, _Germinal_, and _Le Rêve_. Their high position as\r\nregards the number of the editions is explained by the fact that the\r\nfirst treats of the war of 1870, the second of socialism, the third of\r\nmysticism. These three works appeal to the frame of mind of the period.\r\nThey swim with the fashionable current. But all the rest have owed\r\ntheir success to the lowest instincts of the masses, to its brutish\r\npassion for the sight of crime and voluptuousness.\r\n\r\nM. Zola was bound to make a school--first, because of his successes\r\nin the book trade, which drove into his wake the whole riff-raff of\r\nliterary intriguers and plagiarists, and then because of the facility\r\nwith which his most striking peculiarities can be imitated. His art\r\nis accessible to every bungler of the day who dishonours the literary\r\nvocation by his slovenly hand. An empty and mechanical enumeration of\r\ncompletely indifferent aspects under the pretext of description exacts\r\nno effort. Every porter of a brothel is capable of relating a low\r\ndebauch with the coarsest expressions. The only thing which might offer\r\nsome difficulty would be the invention of a plot, the construction of a\r\nframe of action. But M. Zola, whose strength does not lie in the gift\r\nof story-telling, boasts of this imperfection as a special merit, and\r\nproclaims as a rule of art that the poet must have nothing to relate.\r\nThis rule suits excellently the noxious insects who crawl behind him.\r\nTheir impotence becomes their most brilliant qualification. They know\r\nnothing, they can do nothing, and they are on that account particularly\r\nadapted to ‘_die Moderne_,’ as they say in Germany. Their so-called\r\n‘novels’ depict neither human beings, nor characters, nor destinies;\r\nbut, thou poor Philistine who canst not see it, it is precisely this\r\nwhich constitutes their value!\r\n\r\nMoreover, justice exacts that among Zola’s imitators two groups should\r\nbe distinguished. The one cultivates chiefly his pessimism, and\r\naccepts his obscenities into the bargain, though without enthusiasm,\r\nand often even with visible embarrassment and secret repugnance. It\r\nconsists of hysteric and degenerate subjects who are _bonâ fide_,\r\nwho, in consequence of their organic constitution, actually feel\r\npessimistic, and have found in Zola the artistic formula which\r\ncorresponds most truly with their sentiments. I place in this group\r\nsome dramatic authors of the ‘Théâtre-Libre’ in Paris, directed by M.\r\nAntoine; and the Italian ‘Verists.’ The naturalistic theatre is the\r\nmost untrue thing that has been seen hitherto, even more untrue than\r\nthe operetta and the fairy-play. It cultivates the so-called ‘cruel\r\nterms,’ _i.e._, phrases in which the persons openly make a display\r\nof all the pitiable, infamous and cowardly ideas and feelings which\r\nsurge through their consciousness, and systematically neglect this\r\nmost primitive and palpable fact, that by far the most widespread and\r\ntenacious characteristic of man is hypocrisy and dissimulation. The\r\nforms of customs survive incalculably longer than morality, and man\r\nsimulates the greater honesty, and hides his baseness under appearances\r\nso much the more seeming-pious, as his instincts are more crafty and\r\nmean. The Verists, among whom are many powerful literary natures, are\r\none of the most surprising and distressing phenomena in contemporary\r\nliterature. One understands pessimism in sorely-tried France; one\r\ncomprehends it also in the insupportable narrowness of social life in\r\nthe crepuscular North, with its cloudy gray skies and its scourge of\r\nalcoholism. Eroticism, too, is comprehensible among the overexcited\r\nand exhausted Parisian population, and in the Scandinavian North, as\r\na kind of revolt against the zealous discipline and morose constraint\r\nof a bigotry without joy, and mortifying to the flesh. But how could\r\npessimism spring up under the radiant sunshine and eternally blue sky\r\nof Italy, in the midst of a handsome and joyous people who sing even in\r\nspeaking (invalids like Leopardi might naturally appear as exceptions\r\neverywhere)? and how did Italians arrive at insane lubricity, when in\r\ntheir country there still exists, living in the temples and in the\r\nfields, a souvenir of the artlessly robust sensuality of the pagan\r\nworld, with its symbols of fecundity; where also natural and healthy\r\nsexuality has always preserved through centuries the right to express\r\nitself innocently in art and literature? If Verism is anything else but\r\nan example of the propagation of intellectual epidemics by imitation,\r\nthe task devolves upon the scientific Italian critic to explain this\r\nparadox in the history of manners.\r\n\r\nThe other group of Zola’s imitators is not composed of superior\r\ndegenerates, unhealthy persons who sincerely give themselves out for\r\nwhat they are, and express often with talent what they feel; but of\r\npeople who morally and mentally stand on a level with supporters of\r\nevil, who, instead of the trade of night-birds, have chosen the less\r\ndangerous and hitherto more esteemed vocation of authors of novels\r\nand dramas, when the theory of naturalism had made it accessible\r\nto them. This brood has only taken immodesty from M. Zola, and\r\nconformably with the degree of culture has carried it into obscenity\r\nwithout circumlocution. To this group belong the professional Parisian\r\npornographers, whose daily and weekly papers, stories, pictures, and\r\ntheatrical representations in M. de Chirac’s style, continually give\r\nemployment to the correctional tribunals; the Norwegian authors of\r\nnovels on street-walkers; and, unhappily, also a portion of our ‘Young\r\nGerman’ realists. This group stands outside of literature. It forms a\r\nportion of that riff-raff of great towns who professionally cultivate\r\nimmorality, and have chosen this trade with full responsibility, solely\r\nfrom horror of honest work and greed for lucre. It is not mental\r\ntherapeutics, but criminal justice, which is competent to judge them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ‘YOUNG-GERMAN’ PLAGIARISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS chapter is not, properly, within the scope of this book. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that I did not wish to write a history of literature,\r\nnor to indulge in current æsthetic criticism, but to demonstrate the\r\nunhealthy mental condition of the imitators of fashionable literary\r\ntendencies. It does not enter into my plan to deal with those\r\ndegenerates or lunatics who evolve their works from their own morbid\r\nconsciousness, and themselves discover the artistic formula for their\r\nown eccentricities--in other words, with those leaders who go their\r\nown way because they choose or because they must. Mere imitators I\r\nhave neglected on principle throughout the whole of my inquiry, first\r\nbecause the genuine degenerates only form a feeble minority among\r\nthem, while the great majority is a perfectly responsible rabble of\r\nswindlers and parasites, and next because even the few diseased persons\r\nwho are found in their ranks do not belong to the class of ‘higher’\r\ndegenerates, but are poor weak minds who, taken separately, possess no\r\nimportance whatever, and at most only deserve a fleeting mention in so\r\nfar as they testify to the influence of their masters on ill-balanced\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nIf, then, in spite of this, I devote a special chapter to the so-called\r\n‘Young-German’ ‘realists,’ while I have despatched in a few words the\r\nItalian and Scandinavian Zolaists, it is verily and by no means because\r\nthe former are any more worthy than the latter. On the contrary, some\r\nof the Italian ‘Verists,’ the Dane, J. P. Jakobsen, the Norwegian, Arne\r\nGarborg, the Swede, Auguste Strindberg, devoid as they are of real\r\noriginality, possess, nevertheless, more vigour and talent in their\r\nlittle finger than all ‘Young-Germany’ put together. I only dwell on\r\nthe latter because the history of the propagation of a mental contagion\r\nin his own country is not without importance for the German reader, and\r\nalso because the way in which this group has appeared and permeated\r\nshows up certain traits in which we can detect the neurosis of the age,\r\nand, lastly, because some few of their members are good examples of\r\nintensive hysteria, having, in addition to complete incapacity and a\r\ngeneral feebleness of mind, that malicious and anti-social ego-mania,\r\nthat moral obtuseness, that irresistible need of attracting attention\r\nto themselves, no matter by what means, that facetious vanity and\r\nself-approbation, which characterizes the complaint.\r\n\r\nI will not deny that when I turn towards the ‘Young-German’ movement\r\nI can scarcely maintain the cool equanimity with which, according to\r\nscientific method, I have hitherto observed any given phenomena. As\r\na German writer I feel deep shame and sorrow at the spectacle of the\r\nliterature which has been so long and so brutally proclaimed, with\r\nflourish of trumpets, and with systematic disdain of all that did not\r\nbear its seal, as the unique and exclusively German literature of the\r\npresent time, and even that of the future.[458]\r\n\r\nSince genius was congregated at Weimar, German literature has ever\r\ntaken the lead in civilized humanity. We were the inventors, foreigners\r\nwere the imitators. We provisioned the world with poetic forms and\r\nideas. Romanticism originated among us, and only became a literary\r\nand artistic fashion in France a good many years later, whence it\r\npassed on into England. Görres, Zacharias Werner, Novalis, and Oscar\r\nVon Redwitz, created lyric mysticism and neo-Catholicism among us,\r\nand these have only just reached France. Our poet-precursors of the\r\nrevolution of 1848, Karl Beck, George Herwegh, Freiligrath, Ludwig\r\nSeeger, Friedrich von Sallet, R. E. Prutz, etc., had even then sung\r\nof the misery, the uprisings, and the hopes of the disinherited,\r\nbefore the Walt Whitmans, the William Morrises, and the Jules Jouys,\r\nwere born, men whom to-day people in America, England, and France,\r\nwould like to consider as the discoverers of the Fourth Estate for\r\nlyric poetry. Pessimism was embodied almost at the same time in Italy\r\n(in Leopardi) and among us in Nicholas Lenau, more than a generation\r\nbefore French naturalism built its art upon it. Goethe created symbolic\r\npoetry in the second part of _Faust_ half a century before Ibsen and\r\nthe French Symbolists parodied this tendency. Every healthy current\r\nand every pathological current in contemporary poetry and art can be\r\ntraced back to a German source, every progress and every decadence in\r\nthis sphere have their point of departure in Germany. The philosophical\r\ntheory of every novel method of thought, as well as of every new error,\r\nwhich, during a hundred years, have gained a hold over civilized\r\nhumanity, has been furnished by the Germans. Fichte gave us the theory\r\nof romanticism; Feuerbach (almost at the same time as Auguste Comte),\r\nthat of the mechanical conception of the world; Schopenhauer, that of\r\npessimism; the Hegelians, Max Stirner, and Karl Marx, that of the most\r\nrigid ego-mania and the most rigid collectivism, etc. And now we suffer\r\nthe humiliation of seeing a heap of contemptible plagiarists hawking\r\nabout the dullest and coarsest counterfeit of French imitations (which\r\nall the clever men in France have already abandoned and repudiated)\r\nas ‘the most modern’ production offered by Germany, as the flower of\r\nGerman literature, present and future. We even permit foreign critics\r\nto say: ‘Ancient fashions disdained in France even by village beauties,\r\nare to be seen exhibited in German shop-windows as the greatest\r\nnovelties, and credulously accepted by the public.’ The realists\r\nnaturally deny that they are mere repeaters and limping belated\r\nfollowers.[459] But he who knows a little more of art and poetry\r\nthan is learnt in a Berlin tavern frequented by realists, or in a low\r\nnewspaper informed by this sort of company; he who contemplates in its\r\nentire range the contemporary movement of thought without stopping\r\non the frontiers of his own country, can have no doubt whatever that\r\nGerman realism, as a local phenomenon, may have for Germany itself\r\na melancholy importance, but does not exist at all for universal\r\nliterature, because all trace of personal or national originality is\r\nlacking. To the chorus in which the voices of humanity express its\r\nfeelings and thoughts, not the faintest new note has been added by it.\r\n\r\nPlagiarists so low down in the scale as the German realists are not in\r\nthe least entitled to a detailed individual examination. To do this\r\nwould be to make one’s self both ridiculous in the eyes of competent\r\njudges and of a piece with strolling players, to whom it is a matter\r\nof small importance whether they are praised or blamed, provided they\r\nare mentioned. Other motives also warn me to be prudent in the choice\r\nof examples I propose to lay before the reader. I am firmly convinced\r\nthat in a few years all this movement will be forgotten even to the\r\nname itself. The lads who now pretend to be the future of German\r\nliterature will discover little by little that the business to which\r\nthey have devoted themselves is less agreeable and lucrative than they\r\nhad imagined.[460] Those among them who yet possess a last remnant of\r\nhealth and strength will find the way to their natural vocation, and\r\nbecome restaurant-waiters or servants, night-watchmen or peddlers, and\r\nI should fear to injure their advancement in these honest professions\r\nif I nailed here the remembrance of their aberration of past days,\r\nwhich would otherwise be forgotten by all. The feebler and weaker\r\namong them, who could not manfully resolve to earn their bread by a\r\ndecent occupation, will disappear probably as drunkards, vagabonds,\r\nbeggars, perhaps even in a house of correction, and if, after the\r\nlapse of years, a serious reader happened to come across their names\r\nin this book, he would be right in exclaiming, ‘What sort of bad joke\r\nis this? What does the author want to make me believe? There never\r\nhave been such men!’ Finally, an absolutely incapable pseudo-writer\r\nis individually deprived of all importance, and only acquires it as\r\none of a number. He cannot therefore be treated critically, but merely\r\nstatistically. For all these reasons I shall only draw from the whole\r\nnumber a few characters and works, to show with their help what German\r\n‘realism’ really is.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the realist school is Karl Bleibtreu. He accomplished\r\nthis work of foundation by publishing a brochure of which the principal\r\nfeature was a cover of brilliant red furrowed by black lightning in\r\nzigzags, and which bore this title like the roll of a kettledrum,\r\n_Revolution in Literature_. In this literary ‘tout’ Bleibtreu, without\r\nthe slightest attempt at substantiation, but with a brazen brow,\r\ndepreciated a whole series of esteemed and successful authors, swore\r\nwith great oaths that they were dead and buried, and announced the dawn\r\nof a new literary epoch, which already counted a certain number of\r\ngeniuses, at the head of whom he himself stood.\r\n\r\nAs an author Bleibtreu, in spite of the many and various works he has\r\nalready published, does not yet count for much. It would, however, be\r\nunjust to ignore his great ability as a book-maker. In this respect\r\n_Revolution in der Literatur_ is a model production. With skilful\r\naddress, he mingled authors of repute whom he hacked into sausage-meat\r\nwith a few shallow scribblers in vogue, whom it was no doubt rather\r\nfoolish to fight, with the grand airs of a gladiator, but whom no one\r\nwould have defended against a smiling disdain. The presence of these\r\nunwarranted intruders into the group whom he undertook to extirpate\r\nfrom literature, may give to his raising of the standard a semblance\r\nof reason in the eyes of superficial readers. Not less cleverly chosen\r\nwere the people whom he presented to readers as the new geniuses. With\r\nthe exception of two or three decent mediocrities, for whom there is\r\nalways a little modest corner in the literature of a great people,\r\nthese were complete nullities from whom he himself never had to fear a\r\ndangerous competition. The greatest of his geniuses is, for example,\r\nMax Kretzer, a man who writes, in the German of a Cameroon-Negro,\r\nsome professedly ‘Berlin’ novels, of which the best known, _Die\r\nVerkommenen_, is ‘Berlinish’ to such a degree that it simply dilutes\r\nthe history of the widow Gras and the workman Gaudry, which took\r\nplace in Paris in 1877. This event, celebrated as the first adventure\r\nwith cocottes in which vitriol played a part, could only happen in\r\nParis, and under the conditions of Parisian life. It is specifically\r\nParisian. But Kretzer calmly removed the Paris trade-mark, replacing\r\nit with that of Berlin, and he thus created a ‘Berlin’ novel, vaunted\r\nby Bleibtreu as the ideal of a ‘genuine’ and ‘true’ exposition. He\r\nreclothes his newly-discovered ‘geniuses,’ who recall Falstaff’s\r\nrecruits, Mouldy, Shadow, Wart, Feeble, and Bullcalf (_King Henry\r\nIV._, Part II.), in a uniform which he could not have chosen more\r\neffectively. He dressed them out in the costume of Schiller’s brigands\r\nin the Bohemian forests; he pronounced them to be a troop of rebels,\r\nfighters at barricades, Lützow huntsmen in the struggle for freedom\r\nagainst hypocrisy perukes, and pig-tails, and all obstructionists; and\r\nhe hoped that youth and the friends of progress would take him for\r\nsomething serious, on seeing him march at the head of his poor, infirm\r\ncripples and knockknees, thus disguised.\r\n\r\nHis plan, although excellently contrived and conducted, was only\r\npartially successful. Scarcely had he in a certain measure organized\r\nand drilled his little troop, when it mutinied and drove him away.\r\nIt did not choose another captain, for each private soldier wished\r\nhimself to be chief, and the feeblest and most timid of the band\r\nalone recognised any other genius outside his own. Bleibtreu has not\r\nto this day got over the ingratitude of the people who had taken his\r\nmystification seriously, and had really looked upon themselves as the\r\ngeniuses he had proclaimed them to be, without, as he thought, running\r\nany risks; and in his last publication he still utters his sorrow in\r\nthese bitter verses (_Aus einem lyrischen Tagebuch_):\r\n\r\n ‘For what purpose this long struggle? ’Tis vain! And my hand is\r\n paralyzed. Long live falsehood, stupidity, folly! Adieu, thou German\r\n piggery! The earth of the tomb will extinguish the conflagration.\r\n I have been, as long as I could think, a veritable booby. I was no\r\n honest German, I was a wounded swan.’\r\n\r\nBleibtreu could not give any talent to the realists invented by him,\r\nbut the latter borrowed from him a few of his turns of expression.\r\nTo make an impression on the ignorant, they have associated with\r\nthemselves as honorary members some respectable authors whom one is\r\nsurprised to meet with _dans ce galère_. Thus the realists include\r\namong their numbers, for example, Théodore Fontane, a true poet, whose\r\nnovels honourably hold their place among the best productions of the\r\nkind in any literature of Europe; H. Heiberg, of vigorous although\r\nunequal talent; unfortunately compelled, as it would seem, by external\r\ncircumstances to hasty and excessive work, against which, perhaps, his\r\nartistic conscience vainly protests; and Detlev von Liliencron, who\r\nis by no means a genius, but a good lyric poet with a sense of style,\r\nand who may rank by the side of _epigoni_ such as a Hans Hopfen, a\r\nHermann Lingg, a Martin Greif. Considering the high level that German\r\nlyric poetry--the first in the world even in the judgment of foreign\r\nnations--has occupied uninterruptedly since Goethe, it is giving a\r\nGerman poet no small praise if one can say he is not inferior to the\r\naverage of the last seventy years. Liliencron, however, does not\r\nsurpass it, and I do not see how he can be fairly placed above Rudolf\r\nBaumbach, for example, whom the realists affect to despise, probably\r\nbecause he has disdained to join their gang. It is not incomprehensible\r\nthat a Fontane or a Heiberg should consent to suffer the importunate\r\npromiscuousness of the realists. The Church, too, admits sometimes\r\nto serve in the Mass young rogues from the street, who have only to\r\nswing the censer. The sole thing that is demanded of them as realists\r\n_honoris causâ_, is to bear silently and smilingly this compromise of\r\nan honourable name. Liliencron alone thinks himself obliged to make\r\nsome concessions to his new companions, in using here and there in his\r\nlast poems, not his own language, but theirs.\r\n\r\nBesides the smuggling in of some esteemed names among theirs, the\r\nrealists have carefully practised and cultivated another business-trick\r\nof Bleibtreu’s--that of effective disguise. They assumed (in the\r\ncollection of lyric poetry entitled _Young Germany_, Friedenau and\r\nLeipzig, 1886) the name of ‘Young Germany,’ which calls up a faint\r\nremembrance of the great and bold innovators of 1830, as well as ideas\r\nof blooming youth and spring, with a false nose of modernism tied on.\r\nBut let us here at once remark that the realists, plagiarists to the\r\nbackbone, do not even possess sufficient independence to find a name\r\npeculiarly their own, but have quietly plagiarized the denomination\r\nunder which the Heine-Boerne-Gutzkow group has become renowned.\r\n\r\nAs the first specimen of ‘realist’ literature of ‘Young Germany,’\r\nI will quote the novel by Heinz Tovote, _Im Liebesrausch_.[461]\r\nHe relates the history of a landed proprietor and former officer,\r\nHerbert von Düren, who makes the acquaintance of a certain Lucy,\r\nformerly a waitress at an inn, and the mistress of quite a number of\r\nyoung men in succession. He makes her his mistress, and indulges in\r\nhis passion until, being unable to live without her, he induces her\r\nto marry him. Herbert, who is only partially acquainted with Lucy’s\r\npast, presents her to his mother. The latter, who very soon perceives\r\nthe relations existing between her son and this person, nevertheless\r\ngives her consent, and the marriage takes place. In the aristocratic\r\nand military society of Berlin, in which the couple move for a time,\r\nLucy’s antecedents soon become known, and she is ‘cut’ by all the\r\nworld. Herbert himself remains faithfully attached to her, until he\r\ndiscovers one day by accident, at the house of one of his friends--of\r\ncourse a ‘realist’ painter--a picture representing the nude figure of\r\nLucy bathing in the sea! He very logically concludes that his wife had\r\nposed as a model to the painter, and he drives her away. As a matter\r\nof fact, however, the ‘realist’ had painted the nude figure from\r\nimagination, and involuntarily given it Lucy’s features, because of\r\nthe respectful admiration he secretly cherishes for her. (Judge for a\r\nmoment how that could be if she had been disreputable!) Then Herbert,\r\nsmitten with remorse, seeks the vanished Lucy, whom he discovers, after\r\nheart-breaking efforts, in his own house, where she has lived for\r\nmonths unknown to him. The reconciliation of husband and wife takes\r\nplace amid general pathos, and the young wife dies in giving birth to a\r\nchild, and uttering affecting sentiments.\r\n\r\nI will not waste time by pointing out the silliness of this story.\r\nThe essential part in a novel, moreover, is not the plot, but the\r\nform, in both the narrower and the broader sense--language, style,\r\ncomposition--and these I will examine a little later.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing we have a right to expect of a man who assumes\r\nto write for the public, _i.e._, for the educated people of his own\r\nnation, is evidently that he should be master of his own language. Now,\r\nHeinz Tovote has no idea whatever of German. He commits the grossest\r\nerrors every moment--solecisms, mistakes of syntax, ignorance of the\r\nvalue of words--which make one’s hair stand on end. Some few of these\r\nabominable faults of language are tolerably widespread, others belong\r\nto the jargon of the roughest class of the people; but there are some\r\nthat Tovote could never have heard. They are the result of his personal\r\nignorance of German grammar.\r\n\r\nNext as to his style. When Tovote writes a description, in order to\r\ndetermine and strengthen the substantive, he chooses, on principle,\r\nthe adjective naturally contained in that substantive. Here are some\r\nexamples of this intolerable tautology: ‘An icy January storm.’ ‘In the\r\nFriedrichstrasse light elegant equipages were crowded.’ ‘Incarnation of\r\nthe most lovable grace.’ ‘A slowly creeping fever’ ‘A lazy somnolence.’\r\n‘They glowed fiery in the last light.’ ‘She suffered cruel torments,’\r\netc. I doubt if any author, having but little respect for himself,\r\nhis vocation, his maternal tongue or his readers, would put such\r\nwords together. There is no necessity, in hunting for the ‘rare and\r\nprecious epithet,’ to go so far as the French stylists, but such a\r\nsweeping together of the stalest, most useless, and most inexpressive\r\nadjectives is not literature; it is properly, to echo the French\r\ncritic, the work of scavengers. Another characteristic of this style is\r\nits silliness. The author relates that Herbert von Düren was ‘keenly\r\ninterested, from its first appearance,’ in Sullivan’s operetta _The\r\nMikado_. ‘Now that it had cast off its English garb, it seemed to him\r\nstill more indigenous.’ Thus he seriously declares that an English\r\noperetta has seemed to a German more indigenous in the German language\r\nthan in English. ‘Suddenly he was seized with a senseless fury against\r\nthis man who saluted him so politely, whereby he, who was habitually\r\npoliteness itself to everyone, did not return the salute, and turned\r\naway.’ Not to respond to a salute by way of expressing his ‘senseless\r\nfury’ is truly not very ferocious on the part of an old officer.\r\n‘The horses were hanging their heads sadly, and sleeping.’ That it\r\nis possible to sleep sadly or gaily is a discovery by Tovote. ‘Like\r\nwalls, the colossi of houses stood crowding against each other.’ Like\r\nwalls? One would think that houses really have walls. It is exactly as\r\nif Tovote had said: ‘Like men, the people stood crowding against each\r\nother.’\r\n\r\nWhen Tovote strives to write in a sublime and beautiful style, the\r\nresult we get is as follows: ‘Yet there lay in the slender perfectly\r\nlevelled lines a slumbering strength.’ (What can the lines be which\r\nare ‘slender,’ _i.e._, not thick and ‘perfectly levelled’?) ‘She\r\nwas already smiling through her tears, and her face resembled a\r\nsummer landscape which, while the rain still falls on the corn, is\r\nbathed again in the bright rays of the sun emerging from clouds.’\r\nThus, what we are first to think of when contemplating a face is a\r\nsummer landscape. ‘He felt how her lips clung [_sich klammerten!_]\r\nto his.’ ‘It must be granted that, considering his youth, he has the\r\nincontestable genius of a lively conception,’ etc.\r\n\r\nTovote seeks to plagiarize the diffuse descriptions of the French\r\nnaturalists, and unfolds pictures the novelty, clearness, and vigour\r\nof which the following quotations will enable us to admire. (End\r\nof a theatrical representation:) ‘In the stalls the seats clapped\r\nback with a muffled sound.... The audience rose, doors were opened,\r\ncurtains were drawn back, and the theatre emptied slowly, while a few\r\nisolated spectators alone remained in their places.’ ‘Unceasingly,\r\nthe whole night the snowflakes fell. In thick bales [!] it lay on\r\nthe bare branches of the trees, which threatened to break down in\r\nwinterly weakness. The pines and low bushes were enveloped in a thick\r\nmantle of snow. To the straw, wound round the standard roses, the snow\r\nclung, and formed strange figures; it lay a foot high on the walls,\r\nand delicately veiled the points of the iron railings. All tracks\r\nwere effaced. The wind, which drove the flakes before it, threw them\r\ninto all the hollows, so that all the corners and all the unevennesses\r\ndisappeared.’ ‘They stood high above the sea, which spread around them\r\nlike an infinite plain.’ ‘The sun had set.... The clouds, heavily\r\nencamped on the horizon, still glowed with flaming crimson purple;\r\nthen they passed into violet, which changed into a colourless gray [so\r\nthere is a coloured gray also?] until night descended, and all colours\r\ngradually died out.’ (Compare this pitiable attempt to counterfeit\r\n‘impressionism’ with the French models quoted in the preceding\r\nchapter.) ‘The night had completely closed in--a dark, profoundly black\r\nnight.’ (Consider the juxtaposition of these two adjectives.) ‘The moon\r\nalone hung mournfully above the waters [the moon in a night both ‘dark’\r\nand ‘profoundly black!’], and the lighthouse threw its flood of light\r\ninto the distance. Deep at their feet the sea raved with muffled roar\r\nin the spite of a thousand years[!], and licked the creviced rocks.’\r\nA ‘raving spite’ which ‘licks’ does not appear to be a very dangerous\r\nspite. ‘She retained the deep wound over her eye as a little scar all\r\nher life long.’ If she had a ‘little scar,’ she did not therefore\r\nkeep a deep wound ‘all her life long.’ ‘Above them, in the blue sky,\r\na vulture wheeled in circles with outspread wings, lost like a black\r\npoint in this sea of light.’ In a vulture which is only seen as ‘a\r\nblack point,’ it is not possible to distinguish the ‘outspread wings.’\r\nHere is the description of a face: ‘Two full fresh lips, chaste[!],\r\nbright red, a graceful little nose, imperceptibly tilted, but parting\r\nin a narrow straight line from the forehead.’ We will leave the reader\r\nthe trouble of imagining for himself this ‘little nose imperceptibly\r\ntilted’ in ‘the narrow straight line.’ ‘The engine of the express train\r\npanted across the level plain which stretched all round like a burning\r\ndesert. Right and left, field after field of corn, fruitful orchards\r\nand verdant meadows.’ Fields, orchards, meadows, and yet a ‘burning[?]\r\ndesert’? ‘The half-closed eyes, with their white membranes, look at him\r\nso steadily.’ This does not mean, as one might suppose, the eyes of a\r\nbird, but those of a human being, in which our novelist professes to\r\nhave discovered these incomprehensible ‘white membranes.’\r\n\r\nWe have seen what impressionism and the descriptive _tic_ of naturalism\r\nhave become in the hands of Tovote. I will now show how this ‘realist’\r\ncan observe and reproduce reality in the smallest as in the greatest\r\nthings. Herbert, the first evening of his acquaintance with Lucy,\r\ntakes her to a restaurant and orders, among other things, a bottle of\r\nburgundy. ‘The waiter placed the pot-bellied bottle on the table, in a\r\nflourishing curve.’ Burgundy in ‘pot-bellied’ bottles! They eat soup,\r\nserved in ‘silver bowls’(!), green peas and a capon, the excellence\r\nof which forms the subject of their incredible conversation at table,\r\nand when this repast is disposed of, and Lucy has lighted a cigarette,\r\nshe asks for oysters, which are brought and eaten by her ‘served\r\naccording to the rules of art.’ I should certainly not reproach anyone\r\nfor not knowing a bottle of burgundy by sight, nor at which stage of\r\na repast one eats oysters. I myself did not grow up amongst oysters\r\nand burgundy, but it would be more honest not to speak of these good\r\nthings till one knows something of them. Let us give a passing notice\r\nto the unconscious respect, mingled with envy, for the difficult and\r\ndistinguished occupation of eating oysters, deliciously revealed in\r\nthis admiring declaration, that Lucy has oysters ‘served’(?) ‘according\r\nto the rules of art,’ and the backwoodsman’s ignorance of the most\r\nelementary good breeding which Tovote betrays in making a man of the\r\nworld talk incessantly at table about the food. To continue. Lucy’s\r\nlover has travelled, viâ Brussels, ‘from Havre to Egypt.’ In that\r\ncase he must have chartered a steamer on his own account, as there is\r\nno regular line of steamers between Havre and Egypt. For some months\r\nHerbert has had on his writing-table some unfinished manuscripts. ‘He\r\nrummaged through this heap of yellow manuscripts.’ Under shelter the\r\nworst ligneous fibre paper itself would certainly not turn yellow in\r\nthe space of a few months. The bed-chamber, arranged with all possible\r\ncare by Herbert for his Lucy, has ‘blue silk curtains,’ and ‘pale pink\r\nsatin’ seats. Such a wild combination of colours would be avoided by\r\nthe better second-hand dealers even in their shop windows.\r\n\r\nI grant that all these blunders, although amusing, are insignificant.\r\nThey must not be passed over, however, when committed by a ‘realist,’\r\nwho boasts of ‘observation’ and ‘truth.’ Graver still are the\r\nimpossible actions and characters of the men. In a moment of grief Lucy\r\nlets ‘fall her arms on the table-napkin in her lap, and looks vacantly\r\nbefore her, biting her under lip.’ Has anyone ever seen or done such\r\na thing in this state of mind? Wild ecstasy of love Lucy expresses\r\nthus: ‘“Kiss me,” she implored, and her whole being seemed to wish to\r\nlose itself in him--“kiss me!”’ Herbert had made her acquaintance in\r\nHeligoland, where she lived with an Englishman named Ward, and had\r\ntaken her to be Ward’s betrothed. A German officer of good family,\r\nbeing considerably over thirty, was actually able to look upon a woman\r\nliving with a rich young foreigner alone at a watering-place as his\r\nbetrothed! The latter, an absolutely neglected child of the working\r\nclass, learnt English with Ward in less than a year so perfectly that\r\nshe was everywhere mistaken for an Englishwoman, and played the piano\r\nso well that she could execute pieces from operettas, etc.\r\n\r\nI do not consider it a crime when Tovote, in using French words,\r\nconfounds _tourniquet_ with _moulinet_, and speaks of _cabinets\r\nséparés_ instead of _cabinets particuliers_. A German does not require\r\nto know French. It would be a good thing indeed if he knew German.\r\nGood taste, however, would prevent his making a display of scraps of a\r\nlanguage of which he knows absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThe obscenities with which the novel swarms are incomparably weaker\r\nthan in analogous passages by Zola, but they are peculiarly repulsive\r\nbecause, in spite of the absolute incapacity of Tovote to rise above\r\nthe coarseness of commercial travellers relating their love adventures\r\nin hotels, they, nevertheless, betray his determination to be violently\r\nsensational and subtly sensual.\r\n\r\nIf I have lingered thus long over this bungling piece of work, so far\r\nbelow the level of literature, it is because of its being thoroughly\r\ntypical of German realism. The language transgresses the simplest\r\nrules of grammar. Not one expression is accurately chosen, and really\r\ncharacterizes the object or the concept that is brought before\r\nthe reader. That an author should speak not only accurately, but\r\nexpressively, that he should be able to reproduce impressions and ideas\r\nin an original and powerful way, that he must have a feeling for the\r\nvalue and delicate sense of words; of this Tovote has not the slightest\r\nidea. His descriptions are shabby enough to raise a blush on the cheek\r\nof the police reporter of a low class paper. Nothing is seen, nothing\r\nis felt; the whole is but a droning echo of reading of the worst sort.\r\n‘Modernism’ consists finally in this, that a pitiable commonplace is\r\npartly located in Berlin, with here and there vague talk of socialism\r\nand realism. German criticism in the seventies demanded, very justly,\r\nthat the German novel should rest on a solid basis, that it should be\r\nworked out in some well-known period, amid real surroundings, in the\r\nGerman capital of our day. This demand has produced the ‘Berlinese’\r\nnovel of the plagiarists. The especial and characteristic Berlinism\r\nof this novel consists in this, that the author whenever he has to\r\nmention a street, displays the boundless astonishment of a Hottentot at\r\nthe ‘Panoptikum’ (the Grévin Museum in Berlin), because he finds the\r\nstreet full of people, carriages, and shops, and seeks opportunities to\r\nquote the names of the streets in this capital. This method is within\r\nthe reach of every hotel porter. In order to introduce such Berlinism\r\ninto a bad novel, the author need only possess a plan of the town, and\r\nperhaps a guide-book. The peculiarities of life in the capital are\r\nrepresented by passages such as this: ‘On both sides of the pavement\r\n[he meant to say, on the pavement on both sides of the street] a dense\r\ncrowd of people surged, and in the middle of the avenue, under the\r\ntrees, just bursting into leaf, a scattered multitude, resembling the\r\nirregular [?] waves of a flood, pushed on to get out of the town.’ Or:\r\n‘On all the pavements people walking and pushing against each other\r\nin confusion and haste, which increased to a run, in order to avoid\r\nfalling under the wheels, while escaping to a place of refuge from the\r\ndeafening clatter of cabs, tramways, and large heavy omnibuses, with\r\ntheir roofs fully occupied,’ etc. Thus, the only thing Tovote sees in\r\nBerlin is what a peasant from Buxtehude would remark, who has left his\r\nvillage for the first time, and cannot recover from his astonishment\r\nin finding more people and carriages than in his own village street.\r\nThis is just the view which a resident in a town no longer notices,\r\nand which need not be specially described, because it is implied in\r\nthe concept of a ‘town,’ and, above all, of a ‘large town,’ and is,\r\nnotably, in no way characteristic of Berlin, since Breslau, Hamburg,\r\nCologne, etc., present exactly the same sight.\r\n\r\nSocialism enters into the ‘modern’ novel like Pilate into the\r\nCreed. Tovote relates, _e.g._, how Herbert seeks for Lucy, who has\r\ndisappeared; he arrives at last at the workman’s quarter in Berlin,\r\nwhich supplies the author with this fine picture: ‘Everywhere the blue\r\nand gray-red blouse of the workman, which is never seen _Unter den\r\nLinden_, who stands, day after day, near the panting machine, at the\r\nwork-table, where he carries on, during long years, as if asleep, the\r\nsame manual labours, until the callosities on his hands become as hard\r\nas iron.’ Either Herbert, despairingly seeking his mistress, or the\r\nnarrator, wishing to awaken our interest in these events, has thought\r\nof the callosities of the workmen!\r\n\r\nThe automata who in the ‘realist’ novel execute mock-movements, and\r\nbetween whom the dullest and most miserable back-stair sentimentality\r\nis played off, are always the same: a gentleman, an ex-officer\r\nwhenever possible, who, we are assured, is engaged upon ‘works on\r\nsocialism’ (of what kind we never learn, it is simply asserted that\r\nthey are ‘very important’); a waitress at an inn, as the embodiment\r\nof the _ewig-Weibliche_; and a realist painter who plans or executes\r\npictures destined to regenerate humanity, and to establish the\r\nmillennium on earth. Here is the recipe for the ‘modernism’ of the\r\n‘Young-German’ realism: quotation of the names of the Berlin streets,\r\nrapture at the sight of some cabs and omnibuses, a little Berlinese\r\ndialect in the mouth of the characters, coarse and stupid eroticism,\r\nunctuous allusions to socialism and phrases on painting, such as a\r\ngoose-fattener grown rich might make if she wished to pass herself off\r\nas a lady. Of the three persons who are always the supporters of this\r\n‘modernity’ the waitress is the only really original one. The merit\r\nof this treasure belongs to Bleibtreu, who first presented her to the\r\nadmiration and imitation of his little band in his collection of novels\r\nentitled _Schlechte Gesellschaft_. She is a conglomeration of all the\r\nfabulous beings that have hitherto been imagined in poetry: a winged\r\nchimæra, a sphinx with lion’s claws, and a siren with a fish’s tail,\r\nall at one and the same time. She contains in herself every charm and\r\nevery gift, love and wisdom, virtue and love-glowing paganism. It is by\r\nthe waitress at the inn that the talent for observation and creative\r\npower of the German ‘realist’ can be most accurately gauged.\r\n\r\nIf Tovote is a representative type--by no means diseased, but merely\r\nincapable beyond conception--of intruders into literature with which\r\nthey will at most be connected as peddling hawkers of trashy novels,\r\nwe meet in Hermann Bahr with a clearly pathological individuality.\r\nBahr is an advanced hysteric who wants at all hazards to get himself\r\ntalked about, and has had the unfortunate idea of achieving this result\r\nby books. Devoid of talent to an almost impossible degree, he seeks\r\nto captivate attention by the maddest eccentricities. Thus, he calls\r\nthe book most characteristic of his method among those he has hitherto\r\npublished, _Die gute Schule; Seelenstände_.[462] _Seelenstände_\r\nliterally means ‘states of soul.’ He had read and not understood the\r\nterm _états d’âme_ in the new French authors, _état_ having been used\r\nin the political sense which it has in _tiers-états_.\r\n\r\nIn the story related in the _Seelenstände_, a part at least of the\r\nrecipe previously mentioned is utilized. The hero is an Austrian\r\npainter living in Paris. One day, weary of living alone, he picks up a\r\ngirl in the street, who, contrary to the orthodox procedure, is not a\r\nwaitress, but a dressmaker, possessing, nevertheless, all the mythical\r\nexcellence of the ‘Young German’ barmaid; he lives with her for a time,\r\nthen wearies of her, and torments her to such a degree that she leaves\r\nhim one fine day and goes off with a rich negro, whom she induces to\r\nbuy pictures at a high price from her abandoned lover.\r\n\r\nThis fine story is the frame in which Bahr reveals the ‘state’ of his\r\nhero’s ‘soul.’ This author is a plagiarist of an inveterate type,\r\nsuch as is only met with in serious cases of hysteria. Not a single\r\nauthor of any individuality who has passed before his eyes has been\r\nable to escape his rage for servile imitation. The principle of\r\nthe ‘Good School’--the misery of a painter who struggles with the\r\nconception of a work of art intended to express his whole soul, and\r\nwho recognises with despair his impotence to realize it--is subtilized\r\nfrom Zola’s _L’[Œuvre_, All the details, as we shall see, he has taken\r\nfrom Nietzsche, Stirner, Ibsen, the Diabolics, Decadents, and French\r\nImpressionists. But all he plagiarizes becomes, under his pen, a parody\r\nof inimitably exquisite absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe painter’s distress of mind is ‘the lyrism of red. His whole soul\r\nwas steeped in red, all his feelings, all his aims, all his desires, in\r\nsonnets of lament and hope; and in general a complete biography of red,\r\nwhat took place in him and usually whatever could happen to him.... But\r\nthis lofty canticle of the red fulfilled itself in the real, simple\r\ntones of daily life.... It was a large well-boiled lobster, in which\r\nhe embodied the masterful spirit and the violence of the red, his\r\nlanguor in a salmon on one side, and his mischievousness and gaiety\r\nof disposition in many radishes in cheerful variations. But the great\r\nand supreme confession of his whole soul hung on a purple tablecloth\r\nwith heavy folds, on which the sun shone, a narrow shaft, but with all\r\nthe more fiery glow.’ If the struggle with the ‘biography of the red’\r\nwas a torture to him, even worse things were about to happen. One day\r\n‘the curse struck him behind, coming from an excellent salmon, juicy\r\nand sweet, which one would never have suspected of perfidy as it lay\r\ncradling itself in a rosy shimmer in its rich herb sauce.’ (A cooked\r\nsalmon cradling itself! This must have produced a ghostly effect. And\r\nthis uncanny salmon struck him ‘behind,’ although it was on the table\r\nbefore him!) But it was precisely this sauce, this sauce of green\r\nherbs, the pride of the cook--yes, it was this that did it. It was this\r\nthat conquered him. He had never seen anything like it--never before,\r\nas far back as he could remember, a softer and sweeter green, at once\r\nso languishing and so joyous that one could have sung and shouted for\r\njoy. The whole rococo was in it, only in a much more gracious, yearning\r\nnote. It had to go into his picture. But he could never hit off that\r\ngreen sauce, and this was the tragedy of his life. He ‘kept the truth\r\nlocked up cowardly and idle, he who alone could grant it; he did not\r\ngive it to them to assuage thirst, this healing and redeeming work of\r\nhis breast,’ namely, the green sauce! ‘He would have liked to make a\r\ngigantic gimlet revolve in his flesh with a burning screw ... deep,\r\nvery deep, till there was a great hole ... an immense triumphal gate of\r\nhis art, through which the internals could spit it out.’\r\n\r\nWhat makes this struggle with the green sauce, for the purpose\r\nof overcoming it in a ‘healing and redeeming’ work of art, so\r\nirresistibly comic is that the whole passage is written in an entirely\r\nserious view, and without the least idea of joking!\r\n\r\nBahr describes his own style in these words: ‘A wild, feverish,\r\ntropical style, which calls nothing by its usual name in the ordinary\r\nidiom, but which racks itself in the hope of finding unheard-of,\r\nobscure, and strange neologisms, in a forced and singular combination.’\r\n\r\nThe painter’s mistress must have been a superb creature, to judge\r\nby the description. When a stranger spoke to her in the street ‘she\r\nslightly quickened her steps, and with eyelids haughtily raised,\r\nand her little head thrown back sideways, she began to hum softly,\r\nsharply snapping her fingers with impatience, in such a way as to\r\nrouse his desire to persevere in his useless suit.’ This behaviour\r\ninduces Bahr to call her a ‘majestically inaccessible young lady.’\r\nBut she is far more remarkable at her morning toilet at home than she\r\nis in the street. ‘Often, when under the greetings of the morning,\r\nwhich enamelled with gold [!] her hyacinthine flesh, she plaited her\r\nhair while standing before her mirror, surrounded by his desires, and\r\nstretched, moistened, and slowly curved, with twitching fingers which\r\nglittered like swift serpents, quite gently and persistently, her\r\ntangled [!] eyelashes, her dishevelled eyebrows, while her lips grew\r\nround with silent whistling, between which the rapid, restless tongue\r\nhissed, shot out, and clacked, and then, with closed eyelids, leant\r\nforward as in submissive adoration, the powder-puff passed slowly,\r\ncautiously, fervently, over the bent cheeks, while the little nose,\r\nfearful of the dust, turned aside,’ the painter, as may be imagined,\r\nbecame so amorous that ‘he licked the soap from her fingers to refresh\r\nhis fevered gums.’ ‘Suddenly standing upright on one leg, with a swing\r\nof the other she kicked her shoe into the air, to catch it again by\r\na nimble, firm movement. In this graceful attitude she remained.’\r\n‘Sometimes she bent down languorously towards herself, very gently,\r\nvery slowly, remaining voluptuously in the curve of her breasts, deep\r\ninto her knees, while her lips moved; sometimes, while her hips turned\r\nin a circle, her neck glided lasciviously into swan-like [!] curves\r\ntowards her obsequious image.’ This sight filled her lover with such\r\nenthusiasm that it seemed to him ‘as if from a thousand springs blasted\r\n[!] torrents blazed through his veins.’\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, I think, to multiply specimens of this style,\r\nwhich simulates insanity, and which is not German, either in formation,\r\nuse of terms, or construction. I wish merely to show to what degree\r\nBahr is a plagiarist. Here we see a copy of Nietzsche: ‘Always the\r\nsame. He ought to do this, and not to do that; the same litany from\r\nhis first infancy--always and only; he should and he shouldn’t. What\r\nhe would was the only thing never demanded of him; and thus, in this\r\nfrightful servitude, he felt himself possessed by an immense desire\r\nto be for once himself at last, and an immense anguish at being\r\nalways someone else eternally.’ ‘To say that everyone only came out\r\nof himself to penetrate into another ... to dominate him! That a man\r\ncould never, should never, he himself, not have one hour of bliss, but\r\neverlastingly renounce, transform, annihilate himself for another’s\r\ngratification.... Alone--alone; why would they not leave one alone?’\r\n... ‘To make a desert for himself--a still silent desert.’ ‘Others had\r\nnot this sentiment of the “I” to such an exuberant and immeasurable\r\nextent.’ ‘The joyous hatred of men and the world.’ Here we have Ibsen:\r\n‘He wished to go into the country--he himself, precisely as proposed by\r\nthe other, certainly. But he wished to go into the country in virtue\r\nof his free resolve, because it was his will, and not the proposal of\r\nanother.... And rather than bend to another’s will he renounced his\r\nown. Moreover, since another wished it, the pleasure of wishing it\r\nhimself was lost to him.’ Here the De Goncourts: ‘There was around\r\nher out of the sorrowful violet and bright gold a misty shimmer.’\r\n‘His feeling was always something inconceivable, and also on a yellow\r\nground--dirty yellow--gasping, ecstatic, faint, pining away with a\r\ndeath-rattle, and with violet tones, but very soft.’ ‘It was chaste\r\nvoluptuousness. He had it there in his brain, pearly gray, melting into\r\nfaint violet.’ Villiers de l’Isle-Adam: ‘He was bound to establish the\r\nnew love.... The question was of doing it in the style of electricity\r\nand steam. An Edison-love ... yes, a machine-like love.’ A mixture of\r\nBaudelaire and Huysmans: ‘In the undulating silver dust of the light\r\na lovely quivering sheen, woven of blue-black and pale green vapour,\r\nbathed her rosy flesh, exhaled by its soft down.... He wished utterly\r\nto destroy and flay her. Nothing but blood--blood. He only felt at ease\r\nwhen it streaked [!] down.... He established a theory according to\r\nwhich this was the way towards the new love, viz., by torture.’ ‘There\r\nlay the meadows red as fire spread out in lovely slopes ... and hopes,\r\nthe blue vampires, grew listless. But upright in its pride and with\r\nimperial mourning walked a huge gray sunflower, silent and pale, on the\r\narm of an awkward fat stinking thistle, which trailed noisily afar with\r\nlarge rough gold.’ ‘This now became for him true art, the art which\r\nalone could redeem and make happy--the art of odours.... From pale and\r\nmoaning fumes of the white rose, in which the suicide triumphs, he\r\nawakened the eternal doctrine of Buddha,’ etc. The rehardness, ainder\r\nis better expressed in the original, in Huysmans’ novel, _A Rebours_.\r\nAs to the passages full of a heat which clamours for a strait-jacket,\r\nand simulates satyriasis and Sadism; as to the quaint confusions and\r\northographical errors in French names which the author, who poses as a\r\nParisian, commits at every step; and as to his frequent manifestation\r\nof megalomania, it is enough to refer to them. These things are not\r\nessential, but they contribute to make Bahr’s book the only product of\r\nhysterical mental derangement hitherto existing in German literature.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of Young-German plagiarists have not yet risen to\r\nthe monumental productions of a Tovote or a Bahr, and have stopped at\r\nshort pieces of lyric poetry.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention ought to be accorded to Gerhart Hauptmann, who has,\r\nunfortunately, permitted himself to be enrolled among the ‘Young\r\nGermans.’ It is difficult to confuse him with them, for if he makes\r\nconcessions to their æsthetics of the commonplace with a carelessness\r\nwhich of itself betrays a disquieting obtuseness of artistic taste and\r\nconscience, he nevertheless may be distinguished from them by some\r\ngreat qualities. He possesses a luscious, vivid vocabulary, full of\r\nexpression and feeling, even though it is a dialect. He knows how to\r\nsee reality, and he has the power to render it in poetry.\r\n\r\nIt will not occur to anyone to pronounce any final judgment on this\r\nauthor of thirty years of age. As yet only his début can be mentioned,\r\nand hopes be formed for his future development. What he has hitherto\r\nproduced has been surprisingly unequal. Side by side with originality\r\nhis works present a barren imitation; with high artistic insight, a\r\nschoolboy’s awkwardness and ingenuousness; with flights of genius,\r\nthe most afflicting commonplaces. One scarcely knows if he is a\r\nnovelist or a dramatic writer. In two of his pieces, in fact, _Vor\r\nSonnenaufgang_ and _College Crampton_, there is such a complete absence\r\nof progressive action, a condition of things so purely stationary and\r\ndevoid of development, that even the instinct of a natural talent for\r\nthe stage could never have so forgotten itself. Perhaps Hauptmann is\r\nonly temporarily under the spell of an æsthetic theory, from which\r\nhe will free himself later. He desires, indeed, to describe the\r\n‘milieu’ faithfully and closely, and loses sight in so doing of the\r\nprincipal thing in poetry--of the characters and their fate. His dramas\r\nfrequently fall asunder for this reason into a series of episodes,\r\nin themselves well observed and characteristic, but only distantly,\r\nor it may be not at all, connected with the plot, as, _e.g._, in the\r\nplay _Vor Sonnenaufgang_, the appearance of Hopslabär, the servant\r\nMary who is leaving, the coachman’s wife stealing the milk, etc. All\r\nare pictures of manners, but at the same time cease to form united\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nIf Hauptmann has borrowed from the French realists the excessive and\r\nuseless accentuation of the ‘milieu,’ he has taken from Ibsen the\r\ncharlatanism of ‘modernity’ and the affectation of the ‘thesis.’ On the\r\nmodel of the Norwegian poet he suddenly inserts into some commonplace\r\nhistory belonging exclusively to no particular period or locality, some\r\nintrusive phrase containing an obscure allusion to ‘the great times\r\nin which we live,’ or the ‘mighty events which are coming to pass,’\r\netc. For example, _Einsame Menschen_ (Lonely Folk) is the needlessly\r\npretentious title of a drama in which we are shown a really Ibsenian\r\nidiot, who fancies himself misunderstood by his excellent wife, and\r\nbecomes enamoured of a Russian girl-student, who is their visitor. As\r\nis generally the case with such feeble wights, he desires to possess\r\nthe Russian, while not losing his wife; he has neither the courage\r\nto wound his wife by openly separating from her, nor the strength to\r\nconquer his guilty passion for the stranger. In his torment he tries\r\nto deceive himself, to persuade himself that his feelings towards\r\nthe Russian are only those of friendship and of gratitude, that she\r\nhas understood him and intellectually stimulated him. The Russian,\r\nhowever, is more clear-sighted, and is about to leave the house. The\r\nend of the story is that the idiot drowns himself. The conception of a\r\nweak man vacillating between two women, of whom one is the embodiment\r\nof duty, and the other of presumptive happiness, is as old as the\r\ntheatre itself. It has nothing to do with the times. It can only be\r\nmade to pass as ‘modernism’ by prevarication. And in this feeble drama\r\nHauptmann makes his characters hold learned conversations full of\r\nallusions, such as the following:\r\n\r\n FRÄULEIN ANNA (_the Russian_). These are, indeed, great times in which\r\n we are living. I seem to feel as if something close and oppressive\r\n were gradually lifting off from us. Do you not agree with me, Doctor?\r\n\r\n JOHANNES (_the idiot_). In what way?\r\n\r\n FRÄULEIN ANNA. On one side, a stifling dread was mastering us; on\r\n the other, a gloomy fanaticism. The excessive strain seems now to be\r\n straightened. Something like a breath of fresh air, let us say from\r\n the twentieth century, has come in upon us.[463]\r\n\r\nThe same swagger of modernity made the author decide on this title,\r\n_Vor Sonnenaufgang_ (Before Sunrise), for his first work, and to\r\nqualify it as a ‘social drama.’ It is no more ‘social’ than any other\r\ndrama, and has no connection whatever with ‘sunrise’ in a metaphorical\r\nsense. It reveals the state of affairs in a Silesian village, where\r\nthe discovery of coal-mines on their land has made the peasants\r\nmillionaires. The contrast between the coarseness of the rustics and\r\ntheir opulence furnishes good scenes for a farce; but what has it to\r\ndo with the age and its problems? A fragment of thesis is dovetailed\r\ninto the farce. The peasant millionaire is a drunkard. The daughter may\r\nhave inherited her father’s vice. And so a man who has become attached\r\nand engaged to her leaves her with sorrowful determination on learning\r\nthat the old man drinks. This thesis is an absurdity. A drunkard can\r\ntransmit his vice to his children, but is not bound to do so, and,\r\nin the instance in point, the grown-up daughter does not betray the\r\nslightest inclination to drink. His thesis is worked out on the model\r\nof Ibsenian maunderings, and is as little taken from life as the lover\r\nwho subordinates his love to a very uncertain theory. In this man we\r\nrecognise our old friend, the type of the recipe for realist novels,\r\nwho makes vague allusions to socialistic studies which he is reputed to\r\npursue,[464] and proves himself, by these shadowy indications, to be a\r\n‘modern’ man.\r\n\r\nHauptmann is true and strong only when he makes the poor of the\r\nlowest class speak in their own dialect. The maidservants in _Vor\r\nSonnenaufgang_ are excellent. The nurse, who sings the baby to sleep;\r\nthe laundress, Frau Lehmann, who laments her domestic troubles, are\r\nby far the most successful characters in _Einsame Menschen_. And if\r\n_Die Weber_ is the best work he has hitherto produced, it is because\r\nonly the poorest people, speaking only their own dialect, appear in\r\nit. But as soon as he has to deal with more complex human beings\r\nof the educated classes--beings who are not perishing with hunger\r\nnor suffering from poverty, who speak high German, and have a wider\r\nintellectual horizon--he becomes uncertain and flat, and catches up the\r\npattern-album of realism instead of taking reality as his model.\r\n\r\n_Die Weber_ (The Weavers) is the only real drama among the five which\r\nHauptmann has hitherto written.[465] There is not much action in this\r\npiece; but it is sufficient, and it progresses. First, we see the\r\nprofound misery in which the weavers are perishing; then we behold\r\nthe rousing of their fury at their intolerable condition, and then\r\ntheir passion gradually developed before our eyes in ever-deepening\r\nintensity, rising into frenzy, destructive madness, tumults and riots,\r\nwith all their tragic consequences. The extraordinary part of this\r\ndrama is that the author has triumphed, with a genius which entitles\r\nhim to our respect, over the enormous difficulty of captivating and\r\nstirring our human feelings, without making any individual character\r\nthe centre-point of his piece, and of distributing the action between a\r\ngreat number of persons and a multitude of individual traits, without\r\nits ever ceasing to be a united and compact whole. These features,\r\nrevealing a painfully minute observation, necessarily belong to\r\nindividuals; nevertheless, they excite a very lively interest, sympathy\r\nand pity, not for the person, but for a whole class of men. We reach\r\nthrough emotion a generalization which usually is only a work of the\r\nintellect, through a poetic composition to a feeling which usually\r\nis excited only by history. In making this possible, Hauptmann rises\r\ninfinitely above the bog of barren imitation, and creates a truly new\r\nform, viz., the drama in which the hero is not an individual, but\r\nthe crowd; he succeeds, by artistic means, in presenting us with the\r\nhallucination that we are constantly seeing before us the nameless\r\nmillions, while naturally there are never more than a few persons in\r\nthe scene who suffer, speak, and act. Besides this great and radical\r\ninnovation, other burning æsthetic questions are solved in the piece\r\nwith overpowering beauty and sobriety. We have here a drama without\r\nlove, and at the same time a proof that other sentiments besides\r\nthe one instinct of sex can powerfully stir the soul of the reader.\r\nThe piece is, moreover, a curious contribution to the wholly new\r\n‘psychology of the masses,’ with which Sighele, Fournial, and others\r\nhave been occupied,[466] and it gives an absolutely exact picture of\r\nthe delirium and hallucinations which take possession of the individual\r\nin the midst of an excited crowd, and transforms his character and\r\nall his instincts after the model of the usually criminal leaders. It\r\ncomprises, finally, this demonstration, which I have nowhere found so\r\nfully in all the international literature with which I am acquainted,\r\nviz., that beautiful effects, when rightly employed, can be obtained\r\neven with repulsive subjects. A poor weaver, who has not touched\r\nmeat for two years, asks a comrade--not having the heart to do it\r\nhimself--to kill a pretty little dog which had run up to him, and his\r\nwife roasts it for him. He cannot control his craving, and begins\r\ndipping into the saucepan almost before the meat is done. His stomach,\r\nhowever, cannot bear the dainty, and to his great despair he is forced\r\nto reject it.[467] The incident in itself is not appetizing. But here\r\nit becomes beautiful and deeply affecting, for it describes with\r\nincomparably tragic power the misery of these woebegone starving people.\r\n\r\nThis piece, apparently so realistic in the sense attached to this\r\nword by superficial talkers, is, on the whole, the most convincing\r\nrefutation of the theory of realism. For it is incredible that all\r\nthe incidents which mark the dreadful position of the weavers could\r\nhave been condensed into exactly one hour of the day, and into one\r\nsingle room of the workman Dreissiger’s house; it is, if not wholly\r\nimpossible, at all events very improbable, that the soldier’s murderous\r\nbullet should happen to kill the weaver Hilse, the only man trusting\r\nin God and resigned to his fate, who remained quietly at his work\r\nwhen all the others rushed out to pillage and riot in the streets.\r\nThe poet has not depicted ‘real’ life here, but has freely utilized\r\nthe materials which he has gained through his observation of life in\r\norder to give artistic expression to his personal ideas. His desire was\r\nto excite our pity as vividly as that felt by himself for a definite\r\nform of human misery. With this object he collected with the sure hand\r\nof an artist, into a narrow compass, events which in life would be\r\ndistributed over months or years, and at long intervals, and he has\r\nguided the flight of a blindly unconscious bullet in such a way that\r\nit commits, like a villain endowed with reason, a peculiarly dastardly\r\ncrime, thus raising our compassion for the poor weavers to the height\r\nof indignation. The piece, then, shows us the ideas and designs of the\r\npoet, his manner of viewing and interpreting reality; it enables us\r\nto discern the sentiments aroused in him by the drama of life. It is,\r\nthen, in the highest degree a ‘subjective’ work, _i.e._, the opposite\r\nof a ‘realistic’ copy of fact, which would have to be photographically\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nHow does it happen that an artist, who applies his means with so fine\r\na taste and with so skilful a calculation of the effect, can commit at\r\nthe same time such naïvetés as, for example, these stage-directions in\r\n_Vor Sonnenaufgang_: ‘Frau Krause, at the moment of seating herself,\r\nremembers [!] that grace has not yet been said, and mechanically folds\r\nher hands, though without otherwise controlling her malice.’ ‘It is\r\nthe peasant Krause who, as always [!], is the last to leave the inn.’\r\n‘He embraces her with the awkwardness of a gorilla,’ etc. How is an\r\nactor to set to work by his awkwardness to make a spectator think\r\nprecisely of a gorilla, or to show him that, ‘as always,’ he is the\r\nlast to leave the inn? More especially, how is it to be explained\r\nthat this same Hauptmann, who has created _Die Weber_, should after\r\nthis lofty composition have written the novels _Der Apostel_ and\r\n_Bahnwärter Thiel_?[468] Here we fall back into the lowest depths of\r\nYoung-German incapacity. The idea is nonsensical and a plagiarism,\r\nthe story has not a ray of truth, and the language (so original and\r\nlifelike, and so exactly rendering the lightest shades of thought when\r\nthe author has recourse to patois) is commonplace and slipshod enough\r\nto make one weep. No words must be wasted on _Der Apostel_. A dreamer,\r\nmanifestly touched by insanity, perambulates the streets of Zürich in\r\nthe costume of an Oriental prophet, and is taken to be Christ by the\r\ncrowd who worship him. This is the whole story. It is represented in\r\nsuch a way that we never know whether the narrative is telling what\r\nthe Apostle dreamed or what really happened. His ideas and sentiments\r\nare an echo of Nietzsche. _Zarathustra_ has incontestably got into\r\nHauptmann’s head, and left him no peace till he had himself produced\r\na second infusion of this idiocy. The railway signalman, Thiel, has\r\nlost his wife at the birth of their first child. Constantly away from\r\nhome on duty, he is obliged to marry again that his child may be cared\r\nfor. The second wife, who soon gives her husband a child of her own,\r\nill-treats the motherless one. In spite of Thiel’s warnings, she one\r\nday leaves her stepchild on the rails untended, and it is crushed\r\nby a train. The signalman then murders his wife and her child with\r\na hatchet in the most horrible manner at night, and is shut up in a\r\nlunatic asylum as a furious madman. Let me quote just a few of his\r\ndescriptions: ‘In the obscurity ... the signalman’s hut was transformed\r\ninto a chapel. A faded photograph of the dead woman on the table before\r\nhim, his Psalm-book and Bible open, he read and sang alternately the\r\nwhole night through, interrupted only by the trains tearing past at\r\nintervals, and fell into an ecstasy so intense that he saw visions\r\nof the dead woman standing before his eyes.’ ‘The [telegraphic] pole,\r\nat the southern extremity of the section, had a particularly full and\r\nbeautiful chord.... The signalman experienced a solemn feeling--as at\r\nchurch. And then in time he came to distinguish a voice which recalled\r\nto him his dead wife. He imagined that it was a chorus of blessed\r\nspirits in which her voice was mingled, and this idea awakened in him a\r\nlonging, an emotion amounting to tears.’ The ‘Young German’ speaks with\r\ncontempt of Berthold Auerbach, because he depicts sentimental peasants.\r\nIs there a single one of Auerbach’s Black Forest folk impregnated with\r\nsuch a rose-watery sentimentality as this signalman of the ‘realist’\r\nHauptmann, who leans against a telegraph-pole, and is moved to tears\r\nat its sound? Again, the passage (pp. 22, 23) which shows us Thiel\r\nin amorous excitement at the sight of his wife (‘from the woman an\r\ninvincible, inevitable power seemed to emanate, which Thiel felt\r\nhimself impotent to resist’) Hauptmann has drawn from Zola’s novels,\r\nand not from the observations of German signalmen. Or has he rather\r\ndesired to depict in a general way a madman who has always been such\r\nlong before his furious insanity broke out? In this case he has drawn\r\nthe picture very falsely.\r\n\r\nAnd the style of this unhappy book! ‘The Scotch firs ... rubbed their\r\nbranches squeaking against each other,’ and ‘a noisy squeaking,\r\nrattling, clattering, and clashing [of a train with the brake on] broke\r\nupon the stillness of the evening.’ One and the same word to describe\r\nthe noise of branches rubbing each other, and of a train with the brake\r\non! ‘Two red round lights [those of a locomotive] pierced the darkness\r\nlike the fixed and staring eyes of a gigantic monster.’ ‘The sun ...\r\nsparkling at its rising like an enormous blood-red jewel.’ ‘The sky\r\nwhich caught, like a gigantic and stainlessly blue bowl of crystal,\r\nthe golden light of the sun.’ And once again: ‘The sky like an empty\r\npale-blue bowl of crystal.’ ‘The moon hung, comparable to a lamp,\r\nabove the forest.’ How can an author who has any respect for himself\r\nemploy comparisons which would make a journeyman tailor who dabbled in\r\nwriting blush? Besides, what countless slovenlinesses! ‘Before his eyes\r\nfloated pell-mell little yellow points like glow-worms.’ Glow-worms do\r\nnot give out a yellow, but a bluish, light. ‘His glassy pupils moved\r\nincessantly.’ This is a phenomenon which no one has yet seen. ‘The\r\ntrunks of the fir-trees stretched like pale decayed bones between the\r\nsummits.’ Bones are that part of the body which does not decay. ‘The\r\nblood which flowed was the sign of combat.’ Truly a reliable sign! Even\r\ngreat faults in grammar are not wanting, but I consent to take these\r\nas printer’s mistakes. If Gerhart Hauptmann has true friends, their\r\nimperative duty is to rouse his conscience. Having shown what excellent\r\nthings he is capable of producing, he has not the right to scribble\r\ncarelessly like the first paltry ‘Young-German’ writer. He must be\r\nstrict with himself, and endeavour always to remain the artist he has\r\nshown himself in _Die Weber_.\r\n\r\nHauptmann’s successes have not let Arno Holz and Johannes Schlaf rest,\r\nand both have joined to imitate his _Vor Sonnenaufgang_. Their united\r\nefforts produced the _Familie Selicke_, a drama in which nothing\r\nhappens, of which alcohol is likewise the subject, and where the\r\npersonages also speak in dialect. For ‘modernity’s’ sake they have\r\nintroduced a theological candidate who has become a free-thinker,\r\nyet none the less wishes to obtain an incumbency. I mention this\r\ninsignificant patchwork play only because the realists usually quote it\r\nas one of their _magna opera_.\r\n\r\nSuch are the Young-German realists, among whose number I will not\r\ninclude, as I said before, a sterling author like Gerhart Hauptmann.\r\nThey do not know German, are incapable of even observing life, still\r\nmore of understanding it; they know nothing, learn nothing, and\r\nexperience nothing whatsoever; have nothing to say, have neither a true\r\nsentiment nor a personal thought to express, yet never cease writing;\r\nand their scribbling, in the eyes of a great number, passes as the\r\nsole German literature of the present and future. They plagiarize\r\nthe stalest of foreign fashions, and call themselves innovators and\r\noriginal geniuses. They append on the signboard before their shops,\r\n‘At the Sign of Modernity,’ and nothing is to be found in them but the\r\ndiscarded breeches of bygone poetasters. If the few lines in which\r\nthey mutter about the obscure Socialistic ‘studies’ and ‘works’ of the\r\nhero be excluded from all they have published up to the present time,\r\nthere will remain a miserable balderdash, without colour, taste, or\r\nconnection with time and space, and which a tolerably conscientious\r\neditor of a newspaper even half a century ago would have thrown into\r\nthe waste-paper basket as altogether too musty. They know that very\r\nwell, and to be beforehand with those who would reproach them with\r\ntheir charlatanism, they audaciously attribute it to those respectable\r\nauthors whom they cover with their slaver. Thus, Hans Merian dares to\r\nsay: ‘Spielhagen makes it appear as though he had drawn the fundamental\r\nideas and conflicts in his novels from the great questions which are\r\nstirring the present time. But closely examined, all this magnificence\r\nevaporates into a vain phantasmagoria.’ And: ‘To the fabricators of\r\nnovels _à la_ Paul Lindau, recently dealing with realism, we address\r\nthe reproach of false realism.’[469] And this same Hans Merian finds\r\nthat the realism of Max Kretzer and of Karl Bleibtreu is genuine,\r\nand that their Parisian cocotte-stories, transported contraband into\r\nBerlin, and their adventures of mythical waitresses, are ‘drawn from\r\nthe great questions of the day’! Is not this the practice of thieves\r\nwho scamper away at full speed before a policeman, shouting as they\r\nrun louder than anyone else, ‘Stop thief!’ The movement of the Young\r\nGerman is an incomparable example in literature of that tendency to\r\nform cliques which I described in the first volume of this work. It\r\nbegan by a foundation in due form. A man arrogated to himself the\r\nrank of captain, and enrolled armed companions in order to repair\r\nwith them into the Bohemian forests. The purpose was the same as that\r\nof every other band of criminals--the ‘Maffia,’ the ‘Mala Vita,’ the\r\n‘Mano negra,’ etc., viz., that of living well without working, by\r\nplundering the rich, by blackmailing the poor, by favouring acts of\r\nvengeance by the members on persons whom they envy, hate, or fear, by\r\nsatisfying with impunity the leaning to license and crime, kept down\r\nby custom and law. Like the ‘Mala Vita’ and analogous associations,\r\nthis band palliates its acts and deeds by stock phrases intended to\r\nsecure the favour, or at least the indulgence, of the crowd, incapable\r\nof judgment and easy to move. Brigands always profess that they are\r\nguided by the desire to repair, to the utmost of their power, the\r\ninjustice of fate, by relieving the rich of their superfluities, and\r\nby then alleviating the misery of the poor. Thus, this band asserts\r\nthat it defends the cause of truth, liberty, and progress, with the\r\nindecent love adventures of tavern-maidservants and prostitutes!\r\nMembership is acquired by formal admission after predetermined tests\r\nhave been undergone. He must first publicly bespatter a well-known\r\nand meritorious author with mud. With the predominance of low and bad\r\nemotions in members of the band, they experience more gratification in\r\nmaligning a man they envy than in being praised themselves. Next, the\r\ncandidate must worship as geniuses one or more members of the band,\r\nand finally give proof, in verse or prose, that he also is able to\r\nexpress, in the language of a _souteneur_, the ideas of a convict, and\r\nthe sensations of a noisome beast. Having undergone these three ordeals\r\nwith success, he is received into the band and declared a genius. Just\r\nas the bands of brigands have their haunts, their receivers of stolen\r\ngoods, and their secret or affiliated allies among the tradespeople, so\r\nthis band possesses its own newspaper, its appointed editors (who, at\r\nfirst at least, accepted everything from it), and secret understandings\r\nwith the critics of respectable papers. Its influence extends even to\r\nforeign countries--a phenomenon frequently observed in the formation of\r\nbands, and expressly confirmed by Lombroso. ‘The Mattoids,’ he says,\r\n‘as opposed to geniuses and fools, are linked together by a sympathy\r\nof interests and hatred; they form a kind of freemasonry so much the\r\nmore powerful that it is less regular. It is founded on the need of\r\nresistance to ridicule which is common to all, and inexorably pursues\r\nthem everywhere on the necessity of uprooting, or at least combating,\r\nthe natural antithesis, which, for them, is the man of genius;\r\nand, in spite of their hating each other, they stand firmly by one\r\nanother.’[470]\r\n\r\nHe who from a height surveys a horizon of a certain extent can easily\r\nobserve the labour of the apostles of this international freemasonry.\r\nM. Téodar de Wyzewa, already mentioned, who introduced to the French\r\nthe insane Nietzsche as the most remarkable author that Germany has\r\nproduced in the second half of this century, speaks in _La Revue bleue_\r\nand in _Le Figaro_ of Conrad Alberti as the ‘poet’ who will dominate\r\nGerman literature in the twentieth century. The ‘new reviews’ of the\r\nSymbolists and Instrumentists, _La Revue blanche_, _La Plume_, etc.,\r\ntranslate the ‘Erlebte Gedichte’ of O. J. Bierbaum. On the other\r\nhand, O. E. Hartleben offers the German public the so-called ‘poetry’\r\nof the Belgian Symbolist, Albert Giraud, _Pierrot lunaire_, and H.\r\nBahr mutters with transport over the Parisian mystics. Ola Hansson is\r\nenthusiastic before German readers over the realists of the North, and\r\ncarries into Sweden the good news of Young-German realism, etc.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the band have not done much good to itself, but they\r\nhave caused serious injuries to German literature. It has necessarily\r\nexerted a baneful attraction over the young who have come to the\r\nfront in the last seven or eight years. If we consider the enormous\r\ndifficulties to which a beginner is exposed, who without protection or\r\ninfluence, depending wholly on himself, enters into the _Via Crucis_\r\nleading to literary success, we shall find it quite comprehensible that\r\nthe tyros should be eager to join themselves to a society possessing\r\na powerful organization, its own periodicals and publishers, as well\r\nas a definite public, and always ready to take the part of its members\r\nwith the unscrupulousness and pugnacity of cut-throats. As members\r\nof the band, they are freed from all the difficulties of beginners.\r\nThe most vigorous talents alone--such, for example, as Hermann\r\nSudermann--disdained to lighten their struggles with the help of such\r\nallies. The others willingly allowed themselves to be affiliated.\r\nThe result was, on the one hand, that wholly incompetent lads were\r\ndrawn into the profession of authors, who would never have come before\r\nthe public if they had not had special depôts to which they could\r\ncart all their rubbish; and, on the other hand, that of procuring for\r\nothers, who were perhaps not wholly devoid of talent, periodicals and\r\npublishers for their childish effusions, the appearance of which in\r\nprint would have been inconceivable before the formation of the band.\r\nSome threw themselves into the literary profession at an age when\r\nthey should have been studying for a long time to come, and thereby\r\nremained ignorant, immature, and superficial; others acquired slipshod\r\nand slovenly habits into which they would never have fallen if, in\r\nthe absence of the conveniences which the organization of the band\r\noffered them, they had been obliged to submit to some discipline, and\r\ndevelop their capacities with care. The existence of this literary\r\n‘Maffia’ assisted the plagiarists against independent minds, the common\r\nherd against the solitary, the scribbler against the artist, and\r\nthe obscene against the refined, so powerfully that competition was\r\nalmost out of the question. The luxuriant growth of silly, boyish, and\r\ncrude book-making is the result of this fostering of incapacity and\r\nimmaturity, and this premium granted to vulgarity. I will demonstrate\r\nin one instance only the disastrous effect of the band. The case of\r\nthe Darmstadt Gymnasium (public school) boy may be remembered, who\r\nwrote under the pseudonym of Hans G. Ludwigs, and committed suicide in\r\n1892 at the age of seventeen. For two years he had offered incense to\r\nthe realist ‘geniuses,’ and published idiotic novels in the official\r\nperiodicals of Young Germany, and he committed suicide because, as he\r\nwrote, ‘this cursed boxed-in life,’ _i.e._, the obligation to learn\r\nand work regularly in class, ‘broke down his strength.’ A good many\r\ngymnasium boys write trumpery things and send them to the papers; but\r\nas these are not printed, they gradually recover their reason. Their\r\nheads do not get turned, and they do not come to imagine that they are\r\nmuch too good to do their lessons, and diligently prepare for their\r\nexaminations. Ludwigs would perhaps have been cured of his folly; he\r\nmight have lived till the present day, and become a useful man, if the\r\ncriminal realist periodicals had not printed his twaddle, and thus\r\ndiverted him from his studies, and intensified his unwholesome boyish\r\nvanity into megalomania.\r\n\r\nThat this invasion by main force, this revolt of slaves into\r\nliterature, to use Nietzsche’s expression, was to a certain extent\r\nsuccessful, can be accounted for by the state of Germany. Its\r\nliterature after 1870 had, in fact, become stagnant. It could not be\r\notherwise. The German people had been obliged to exert their whole\r\nstrength to conquer their unity in terrible wars. Now, it is not\r\npossible simultaneously to make history on a great scale and lead a\r\nnourishing artistic life; it must be one or the other. In the France\r\nof Napoleon I. the most celebrated authors were Delille, Esménard,\r\nParseval de Grandmaison, and Fontanes. The Germany of William I., of\r\nMoltke and Bismarck, could not produce a Goethe or a Schiller. This can\r\nbe explained without any mysticism. From the mighty events of which\r\nthey are witnesses and collaborators the nation obtains a standard of\r\ncomparison, by the side of which all works of art shrink together, and\r\npoets and artists, especially those most gifted and conscientious,\r\nfeel depressed and discouraged, often even paralyzed, by the double\r\nperception that their compatriots only peruse their works distractedly\r\nand superficially, and that their creations absolutely cannot attain\r\nto the grandeur of the historical events passing before their eyes.\r\nIn this critical period of transient mental collapse the Young-German\r\nband made its appearance, and profited greatly by what even honest\r\nand sensible people were obliged to acknowledge as well-founded\r\nattacks--even while they condemned the form of them--on many of the\r\nthen reigning literary senators.\r\n\r\nBut another and weightier ground is the anarchy which reigns at present\r\nin German literature. Our republic of letters is neither governed nor\r\ndefended. It has neither authorities nor police, and that is the reason\r\na small but determined band of evildoers can make a great stir at their\r\npleasure. Our masters do not concern themselves about their posterity\r\nas used to be the case. They have no sense of the duty which success\r\nand glory impose upon them. Let me not be misunderstood. Nothing\r\nis further from my thoughts than the wish to transform literature\r\ninto a closed corporation, and to require the new arrivals to become\r\napprentices and journeymen (although, in fact, every new generation\r\nunconsciously forms itself on the works of its intellectual ancestors).\r\nBut they have not the right to be indifferent to what will come after\r\nthem. They are the intellectual leaders of the people. They have their\r\near. On them is the task incumbent of facilitating the first steps of\r\nthe beginner, and presenting them to the public. By this much would be\r\nobtained--continuity of development, formation of a literary tradition,\r\nrespect and gratitude for predecessors, severe and early suppression of\r\nindividuals of absolutely unjustifiable pretensions, economy of power,\r\nwhich in these days a young author must fritter away in order to come\r\nout of his shell. But our literary chiefs have no understanding for\r\nall this. Each one thinks only of himself, and is furiously jealous\r\nof his colleagues and his followers. Not one of them says that in the\r\nintellectual concert of a great people there is room enough for dozens\r\nof different artists, each one of whom plays his own instrument. Not\r\none takes into consideration that after him new talent will be born,\r\nthat this is a fact he cannot prevent, and that he is preparing for\r\nhimself a better old age by levelling the paths, instead of viciously\r\ntrying to close them to those who, whatever he may do, will still be\r\nhis successors in public favour. Who amongst us has ever received\r\na word of encouragement from one of our literary grandees? To whom\r\namongst us have they testified their interest and benevolence? Not one\r\nof us owes them anything whatsoever; not one feels obliged to be just\r\ntowards them, nor to make himself their champion; and when the band\r\nfell upon them like a lot of brigands, to drive them off with blows,\r\nand put themselves in their place, not a hand was raised to defend\r\nthem, and they were cruelly punished for having lived and acted in\r\nisolation and secret mutual hostility, sternly repulsing the young, and\r\nindifferent to the tastes of the people whenever their own works were\r\nnot in question.\r\n\r\nAnd as we have no Council of Ancients, so we lack also all critical\r\npolice. The reviewer may praise the most wretched production, kill by\r\nsilence or drag through the mire the highest masterpiece, state as the\r\ncontents of a book things of which there is not the slightest mention,\r\nand no one calls him to account, no one stigmatizes his ineptitude,\r\nhis effrontery, or his falsehood. Thus a public that is neither led\r\nnor counselled by its ancients, nor protected by its critical police,\r\nbecomes the predestined prey of all charlatans and impostors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n_THE TWENTIETH CENTURY._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR long and sorrowful wandering through the hospital--for as such\r\nwe have recognised, if not all civilized humanity, at all events the\r\nupper stratum of the population of large towns to be--is ended. We\r\nhave observed the various embodiments which degeneration and hysteria\r\nhave assumed in the art, poetry, and philosophy of our times. We have\r\nseen the mental disorder affecting modern society manifesting itself\r\nchiefly in the following forms: Mysticism, which is the expression of\r\nthe inaptitude for attention, for clear thought and control of the\r\nemotions, and has for its cause the weakness of the higher cerebral\r\ncentres; Ego-mania, which is an effect of faulty transmission by\r\nthe sensory nerves, of obtuseness in the centres of perception,\r\nof aberration of instincts from a craving for sufficiently strong\r\nimpressions, and of the great predominance of organic sensations over\r\nrepresentative consciousness; and false Realism, which proceeds from\r\nconfused æsthetic theories, and characterizes itself by pessimism and\r\nthe irresistible tendency to licentious ideas, and the most vulgar and\r\nunclean modes of expression. In all three tendencies we detect the\r\nsame ultimate elements, viz., a brain incapable of normal working,\r\nthence feebleness of will, inattention, predominance of emotion,\r\nlack of knowledge, absence of sympathy or interest in the world and\r\nhumanity, atrophy of the notion of duty and morality. From a clinical\r\npoint of view somewhat unlike each other, these pathological pictures\r\nare nevertheless only different manifestations of a single and unique\r\nfundamental condition, to wit, exhaustion, and they must be ranked\r\nby the alienist in the genus melancholia, which is the psychiatrical\r\nsymptom of an exhausted central nervous system.\r\n\r\nSuperficial or unfair critics have foisted on me the assertion\r\nthat degeneration and hysteria are the products of the present age.\r\nThe attentive and candid reader will bear witness that I have never\r\ncirculated such an absurdity. Hysteria and degeneration have always\r\nexisted; but they formerly showed themselves sporadically, and had no\r\nimportance in the life of the whole community. It was only the vast\r\nfatigue which was experienced by the generation on which the multitude\r\nof discoveries and innovations burst abruptly, imposing upon it organic\r\nexigencies greatly surpassing its strength, which created favourable\r\nconditions under which these maladies could gain ground enormously, and\r\nbecome a danger to civilization. Certain micro-organisms engendering\r\nmortal diseases have always been present also--for example, the\r\nbacillus of cholera; but they only cause epidemics when circumstances\r\narise intensely favourable for their rapid increase. In the same way\r\nthe body constantly harbours parasites which only injure it when\r\nanother bacillus has invaded and devastated it. For example, we are\r\nalways inhabited by staphylococcus and streptococcus, but the influenza\r\nbacillus must first appear for them to swarm and produce mortal\r\nsuppurations. Thus, the vermin of plagiarists in art and literature\r\nbecomes dangerous only when the insane, who follow their own original\r\npaths, have previously poisoned the _Zeitgeist_, weakened by fatigue,\r\nand rendered it incapable of resistance.\r\n\r\nWe stand now in the midst of a severe mental epidemic; of a sort of\r\nblack death of degeneration and hysteria, and it is natural that we\r\nshould ask anxiously on all sides: ‘What is to come next?’\r\n\r\nThis question of eventuality presents itself to the physician in\r\nevery serious case, and however delicate and rash, above all,\r\nhowever little scientific any prediction may be, he cannot evade the\r\nnecessity of establishing a prognosis. For that matter, this is not\r\npurely arbitrary, not a blind leap into the dark; the most attentive\r\nobservation of all the symptoms, assisted by experience, permits a\r\ngenerally just conclusion on the ulterior evolution of the evil.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the disease may not have yet attained its\r\nculminating point. If it should become more violent, gain yet more\r\nin breadth and depth, then certain phenomena which are perceived as\r\nexceptions or in an embryo condition would henceforth increase to a\r\nformidable extent and develop consistently; others, which at present\r\nare only observed among the inmates of lunatic asylums, would pass into\r\nthe daily habitual condition of whole classes of the population. Life\r\nwould then present somewhat the following picture:\r\n\r\nEvery city possesses its club of suicides. By the side of this exist\r\nclubs for mutual assassination by strangulation, hanging, or stabbing.\r\nIn the place of the present taverns houses would be found devoted to\r\nthe service of consumers of ether, chloral, naphtha, and hashish. The\r\nnumber of persons suffering from aberrations of taste and smell has\r\nbecome so considerable that it is a lucrative trade to open shops for\r\nthem where they can swallow in rich vessels all sorts of dirt, and\r\nbreathe amidst surroundings which do not offend their sense of beauty\r\nnor their habits of comfort the odour of decay and filth. A number of\r\nnew professions are being formed--that of injectors of morphia and\r\ncocaine; of commissioners who, posted at the corners of the streets,\r\noffer their arms to persons attacked by agoraphobia, in order to\r\nenable them to cross the roads and squares; of companies of men who by\r\nvigorous affirmations are charged to tranquillize persons afflicted\r\nwith the mania of doubt when taken by a fit of nervousness, etc.\r\n\r\nThe increase of nervous irritability, far beyond the present standard,\r\nhas made it necessary to institute certain measures of protection.\r\nAfter it has frequently come to pass that overexcited persons, being\r\nunable to resist a sudden impulsion, have killed from their windows\r\nwith air-guns, or have even openly attacked, the street boys who have\r\nuttered shrill whistles or piercingly sharp screams without rhyme or\r\nreason; that they have forced their way into strange houses where\r\nbeginners are practising the piano or singing, and there committed\r\nmurder; that they have made attempts with dynamite against tramways\r\nwhere the conductor rings a bell (as in Berlin) or whistles--it has\r\nbeen forbidden by law to whistle and bawl in the street; special\r\nbuildings, managed in such a way that no sound penetrates to the\r\noutside, have been established for the practice of the piano and\r\nsinging exercises; public conveyances have no right to make a noise,\r\nand the severest penalty is at the same time attached to the possession\r\nof air-guns. The barking of dogs having driven many people in the\r\nneighbourhood to madness and suicide, these animals cannot be kept in a\r\ntown until after they have been made mute by severing the ‘recurrent’\r\nnerve. A new legislation on subjects connected with the press forbids\r\njournalists, under severe penalties, to give detailed accounts of\r\nviolence, or suicides under peculiar circumstances. Editors are\r\nresponsible for all punishable actions committed in imitation of their\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nSexual psychopathy of every nature has become so general and so\r\nimperious that manners and laws have adapted themselves accordingly.\r\nThey appear already in the fashions. Masochists or passivists, who form\r\nthe majority of men, clothe themselves in a costume which recalls, by\r\ncolour and cut, feminine apparel. Women who wish to please men of this\r\nkind wear men’s dress, an eye-glass, boots with spurs and riding-whip,\r\nand only show themselves in the street with a large cigar in their\r\nmouths. The demand of persons with the ‘contrary’ sexual sentiment that\r\npersons of the same sex can conclude a legal marriage has obtained\r\nsatisfaction, seeing they have been numerous enough to elect a majority\r\nof deputies having the same tendency.[471] Sadists, ‘bestials,’\r\nnosophiles, and necrophiles, etc., find legal opportunities to gratify\r\ntheir inclinations. Modesty and restraint are dead superstitions of the\r\npast, and appear only as atavism and among the inhabitants of remote\r\nvillages. The lust of murder is confronted as a disease, and treated by\r\nsurgical intervention, etc.\r\n\r\nThe capacity for attention and contemplation has diminished so greatly\r\nthat instruction at school is at most but two hours a day, and no\r\npublic amusements, such as theatres, concerts, lectures, etc., last\r\nmore than half an hour. For that matter, in the curriculum of studies,\r\nmental education is almost wholly suppressed, and by far the greater\r\npart of the time is reserved for bodily exercises; on the stage only\r\nrepresentations of unveiled eroticism and bloody homicides, and to\r\nthis, flock voluntary victims from all the parts, who aspire to the\r\nvoluptuousness of dying amid the plaudits of delirious spectators.\r\n\r\nThe old religions have not many adherents. On the other hand, there are\r\na great number of spiritualist communities who, instead of priests,\r\nmaintain soothsayers, evokers of the dead, sorcerers, astrologers, and\r\nchiromancers, etc.\r\n\r\nBooks such as those of the present day have not been in fashion for\r\na very long time. Printing is now only on black, blue, or golden\r\npaper; on another colour are single incoherent words, often nothing\r\nbut syllables, nay, even letters or numbers only, but which have a\r\nsymbolical significance which is meant to be guessed by the colour and\r\nprint of the paper and form of the book, the size and nature of the\r\ncharacters. Authors soliciting popularity make comprehension easy by\r\nadding to the text symbolical arabesques, and impregnating the paper\r\nwith a definite perfume. But this is considered vulgar by the refined\r\nand connoisseurs, and is but little esteemed. Some poets who publish no\r\nmore than isolated letters of the alphabet, or whose works are coloured\r\npages on which is absolutely nothing, elicit the greatest admiration.\r\nThere are societies whose object it is to interpret them, and their\r\nenthusiasm is so fanatical that they frequently have fights against\r\neach other ending in murder.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to augment this picture still further, no feature of\r\nwhich is invented, every detail being borrowed from special literature\r\non criminal law and psychiatria, and observations of the peculiarities\r\nof neurasthenics, hysterics, and mattoids. This will be, in the near\r\nfuture, the condition of civilized humanity, if fatigue, nervous\r\nexhaustion, and the diseases and degeneration conditioned by them, make\r\nmuch greater progress.\r\n\r\nWill it come to this? Well, no; I think not. And this, for a reason\r\nwhich scarcely perhaps permits of an objection: because humanity has\r\nnot yet reached the term of its evolution; because the over-exertion\r\nof two or three generations cannot yet have exhausted all its vital\r\npowers. Humanity is not senile. It is still young, and a moment of\r\nover-exertion is not fatal for youth; it can recover itself. Humanity\r\nresembles a vast torrent of lava, which rushes, broad and deep, from\r\nthe crater of a volcano in constant activity. The outer crust cracks\r\ninto cold, vitrified scoriæ, but under this dead shell the mass flows,\r\nrapidly and evenly, in living incandescence.\r\n\r\nAs long as the vital powers of an individual, as of a race, are not\r\nwholly consumed, the organism makes efforts actively or passively\r\nto adapt itself, by seeking to modify injurious conditions, or by\r\nadjusting itself in some way so that conditions impossible to modify\r\nshould be as little noxious as possible. Degenerates, hysterics, and\r\nneurasthenics are not capable of adaptation. Therefore they are fated\r\nto disappear. That which inexorably destroys them is that they do not\r\nknow how to come to terms with reality. They are lost, whether they are\r\nalone in the world, or whether there are people with them who are still\r\nsane, or more sane than they, or at least curable.\r\n\r\nThey are lost if they are alone: for anti-social, inattentive, without\r\njudgment or prevision, they are capable of no useful individual effort,\r\nand still less of a common labour which demands obedience, discipline,\r\nand the regular performance of duty. They fritter away their life in\r\nsolitary, unprofitable, æsthetic debauch, and all that their organs,\r\nwhich are in full regression, are still good for is enervating\r\nenjoyment. Like bats in old towers, they are niched in the proud\r\nmonument of civilization, which they have found ready-made, but they\r\nthemselves can construct nothing more, nor prevent any deterioration.\r\nThey live, like parasites, on labour which past generations have\r\naccumulated for them; and when the heritage is once consumed, they are\r\ncondemned to die of hunger.\r\n\r\nBut they are still more surely and rapidly lost if, instead of being\r\nalone in the world, healthy beings yet live at their side. For in that\r\ncase they have to fight in the struggle for existence, and there is no\r\nleisure for them to perish in a slow decay by their own incapacity\r\nfor work. The normal man, with his clear mind, logical thought, sound\r\njudgment, and strong will, sees, where the degenerate only gropes;\r\nhe plans and acts where the latter dozes and dreams; he drives him\r\nwithout effort from all the places where the life-springs of Nature\r\nbubble up, and, in possession of all the good things of this earth, he\r\nleaves to the impotent degenerate at most the shelter of the hospital,\r\nlunatic asylum, and prison, in contemptuous pity. Let us imagine the\r\ndrivelling Zoroaster of Nietzsche, with his cardboard lions, eagles,\r\nand serpents, from a toyshop, or the noctambulist Des Esseintes of\r\nthe Decadents, sniffing and licking his lips, or Ibsen’s “solitary\r\npowerful” Stockmann, and his Rosmer lusting for suicide--let us imagine\r\nthese beings in competition with men who rise early, and are not weary\r\nbefore sunset, who have clear heads, solid stomachs and hard muscles:\r\nthe comparison will provoke our laughter.\r\n\r\nDegenerates must succumb, therefore. They can neither adapt themselves\r\nto the conditions of Nature and civilization, nor maintain themselves\r\nin the struggle for existence against the healthy. But the latter--and\r\nthe vast masses of the people still include unnumbered millions of\r\nthem--will rapidly and easily adapt themselves to the conditions\r\nwhich new inventions have created in humanity. Those who, by marked\r\ndeficiency of organization, are unable to do so, among the generation\r\ntaken unawares by these inventions, fall out of the ranks; they become\r\nhysterical and neurasthenical, engender degenerates, and in these end\r\ntheir race;[472] but the more vigorous, although they at first also\r\nhave become bewildered and fatigued, recover themselves little by\r\nlittle, their descendants accustom themselves to the rapid progress\r\nwhich humanity must make, and soon their slow respiration and their\r\nquieter pulsations of the heart will prove that it no longer costs them\r\nany effort to keep pace and keep up with the others. The end of the\r\ntwentieth century, therefore, will probably see a generation to whom it\r\nwill not be injurious to read a dozen square yards of newspapers daily,\r\nto be constantly called to the telephone, to be thinking simultaneously\r\nof the five continents of the world, to live half their time in a\r\nrailway carriage or in a flying machine, and to satisfy the demands\r\nof a circle of ten thousand acquaintances, associates, and friends.\r\nIt will know how to find its ease in the midst of a city inhabited\r\nby millions, and will be able, with nerves of gigantic vigour, to\r\nrespond without haste or agitation to the almost innumerable claims of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the new civilization should decidedly outstrip the powers\r\nof humanity, if even the most robust of the species should not in the\r\nlong-run grow up to it, then ulterior generations will settle with\r\nit in another way. They will simply give it up. For humanity has a\r\nsure means of defence against innovations which impose a destructive\r\neffort on its nervous system, namely, ‘misoneism,’ that instinctive,\r\ninvincible aversion to progress and its difficulties that Lombroso has\r\nstudied so much, and to which he has given this name.[473] Misoneism\r\nprotects man from changes of which the suddenness or the extent would\r\nbe baneful to him. But it does not only appear as resistance to the\r\nacceptation of the new; it has another aspect, to wit, the abandonment\r\nand gradual elimination of inventions imposing claims too hard on man.\r\nWe see savage races who die out when the power of the white man makes\r\nit impossible for them to shut out civilization; but we see also some\r\nwho hasten with joy to tear off and throw away the stiff collar imposed\r\nby civilization, as soon as constraint is removed. I need only recall\r\nthe anecdote, related in detail by Darwin, of the Fuegian Jemmy Button,\r\nwho, taken as a child to England and brought up in that country,\r\nreturned to his own land in the patent-leather shoes and gloves and\r\nwhat not of fashionable attire, but who, when scarcely landed, threw\r\noff the spell of all this foreign lumber for which he was not ripe,\r\nand became again a savage among savages.[474] During the period of the\r\ngreat migrations, the barbarians constructed block-houses in the shadow\r\nof the marble palaces of the Romans they had conquered, and preserved\r\nof Roman institutions, inventions, arts and sciences, only those\r\nwhich were easy and pleasant to bear. Humanity has, to-day as much\r\nas ever, the tendency to reject all that it cannot digest. If future\r\ngenerations come to find that the march of progress is too rapid for\r\nthem, they will after a time composedly give it up. They will saunter\r\nalong at their own pace or stop as they choose. They will suppress the\r\ndistribution of letters, allow railways to disappear, banish telephones\r\nfrom dwelling-houses, preserving them only, perhaps, for the service\r\nof the State, will prefer weekly papers to daily journals, will quit\r\ncities to return to the country, will slacken the changes of fashion,\r\nwill simplify the occupations of the day and year, and will grant the\r\nnerves some rest again. Thus, adaptation will be effected in any case,\r\neither by the increase of nervous power or by the renunciation of\r\nacquisitions which exact too much from the nervous system.\r\n\r\nAs to the future of art and literature, with which these inquiries are\r\nchiefly concerned, that can be predicted with tolerable clearness. I\r\nresist the temptation of looking into too remote a future. Otherwise\r\nI should perhaps prove, or at least show as very probable, that in\r\nthe mental life of centuries far ahead of us art and poetry will\r\noccupy but a very insignificant place. Psychology teaches us that the\r\ncourse of development is from instinct to knowledge, from emotion to\r\njudgment, from rambling to regulated association of ideas. Attention\r\nreplaces fugitive ideation; will, guided by reason, replaces caprice.\r\nObservation, then, triumphs ever more and more over imagination and\r\nartistic symbolism--_i.e._, the introduction of erroneous personal\r\ninterpretations of the universe is more and more driven back by an\r\nunderstanding of the laws of Nature. On the other hand, the march\r\nfollowed hitherto by civilization gives us an idea of the fate which\r\nmay be reserved for art and poetry in a very distant future. That which\r\noriginally was the most important occupation of men of full mental\r\ndevelopment, of the maturest, best, and wisest members of society,\r\nbecomes little by little a subordinate pastime, and finally a child’s\r\namusement. Dancing was formerly an extremely important affair. It was\r\nperformed on certain grand occasions, as a State function of the first\r\norder, with solemn ceremonies, after sacrifices and invocations to\r\nthe gods, by the leading warriors of the tribe. To-day it is no more\r\nthan a fleeting pastime for women and youths, and later on its last\r\natavistic survival will be the dancing of children. The fable and the\r\nfairy-tale were once the highest productions of the human mind. In them\r\nthe most hidden wisdom of the tribe and its most precious traditions\r\nwere expressed. To-day they represent a species of literature only\r\ncultivated for the nursery. The verse which by rhythm, figurative\r\nexpression, and rhyme trebly betrays its origin in the stimulations\r\nof rhythmically functioning subordinate organs, in association of\r\nideas working according to external similitudes, and in that working\r\naccording to consonance, was originally the only form of literature.\r\nTo-day it is only employed for purely emotional portrayal; for all\r\nother purposes it has been conquered by prose, and, indeed, has almost\r\npassed into the condition of an atavistic language. Under our very eyes\r\nthe novel is being increasingly degraded, serious and highly cultivated\r\nmen scarcely deeming it worthy of attention, and it appeals more and\r\nmore exclusively to the young and to women. From all these examples,\r\nit is fair to conclude that after some centuries art and poetry will\r\nhave become pure atavisms, and will no longer be cultivated except by\r\nthe most emotional portion of humanity--by women, by the young, perhaps\r\neven by children.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, I merely venture on these passing hints as to\r\ntheir yet remote destinies, and will confine myself to the immediate\r\nfuture, which is far more certain.\r\n\r\nIn all countries æsthetic theorists and critics repeat the phrase that\r\nthe forms hitherto employed by art are henceforth effete and useless,\r\nand that it is preparing something perfectly new, absolutely different\r\nfrom all that is yet known. Richard Wagner first spoke of ‘the art-work\r\nof the future,’ and hundreds of incapable imitators lisp the term after\r\nhim. Some among them go so far as to try to impose upon themselves and\r\nthe world that some inexpressive banality, or some pretentious inanity\r\nwhich they have patched up, is this art-work of the future. But all\r\nthese talks about sunrise, the dawn, new land, etc., are only the\r\ntwaddle of degenerates incapable of thought. The idea that to-morrow\r\nmorning at half-past seven o’clock a monstrous, unsuspected event will\r\nsuddenly take place; that on Thursday next a complete revolution will\r\nbe accomplished at a single blow, that a revelation, a redemption, the\r\nadvent of a new age, is imminent--this is frequently observed among\r\nthe insane; it is a mystic delirium. Reality knows not these sudden\r\nchanges. Even the great revolution in France, although it was directly\r\nthe work of a few ill-regulated minds like Marat and Robespierre, did\r\nnot penetrate far into the depths, as has been shown by H. Taine and\r\nproved by the ulterior progress of history; it changed the outer more\r\nthan the inner relations of the French social organism. All development\r\nis carried on slowly; the day after is the continuation of the day\r\nbefore; every new phenomenon is the outcome of a more ancient one,\r\nand preserves a family resemblance to it. ‘One would say,’ observes\r\nRenan with quiet irony, ‘that the young have neither read the history\r\nof philosophy nor Ecclesiastes: “the thing that hath been, it is\r\nthat which shall be.”’[475] The art and poetry of to-morrow, in all\r\nessential points, will be the art and poetry of to-day and yesterday,\r\nand the spasmodic seeking for new forms is nothing more than hysterical\r\nvanity, the freaks of strolling players and charlatanism. Its sole\r\nresult has hitherto been childish declamation, with coloured lights and\r\nchanging perfumes as accompaniments, and atavistic games of shadows and\r\npantomimes, nor will it produce anything more serious in the future.\r\n\r\nNew forms! Are not the ancient forms flexible and ductile enough to\r\nlend expression to every sentiment and every thought? Has a true poet\r\never found any difficulty in pouring into known and standard forms\r\nthat which surged within him, and demanded an issue? Has form, for\r\nthat matter, the dividing, predetermining, and delimitating importance\r\nwhich dreamers and simpletons attribute to it? The forms of lyric\r\npoetry extend from the birthday-rhyming of the ‘popular poet of the\r\noccasion,’ who works to order and publishes his address in the paper,\r\nto Schiller’s _Lay of the Bell_; dramatic form includes at the same\r\ntime the _Geschundener Raub-ritter_ (The Highwayman Fleeced), acted\r\nsome time ago at Berlin, and Goethe’s _Faust_; the epic form embraces\r\nKortum’s _Jobsiade_ and Dante’s _Divina Commedia_, Heinz Tovote’s\r\n_Im Liebesrauche_ and Thackeray’s _Vanity Fair_. And yet there are\r\nbleatings for ‘new forms’? If such there be, they will give no talent\r\nto the incapable, and those who have talent know how to create\r\nsomething even within the limits of old forms. The most important thing\r\nis the having something to say. Whether it be said under a lyric,\r\ndramatic, or epic form is of no essential consequence, and the author\r\nwill not easily feel the necessity of leaving these forms in order to\r\ninvent some dazzling novelty in which to clothe his ideas. The history\r\nof art and poetry teaches us, moreover, that new forms have not been\r\nfound for three thousand years. The old ones have been given by the\r\nnature of human thought itself. They would only be able to change if\r\nthe form of our thought itself became changed. There is, of course,\r\nevolution, but it only affects externals, not our inmost being. The\r\npainter, for example, discovers the picture on the easel after the\r\npicture on the wall; sculpture, after the free figure, discovers high\r\nrelief, and still later low relief, which already intrenches in a\r\nway not free from objection on the domain of the painter; the drama\r\nrenounces its supernatural character, and learns to unfold itself in\r\na more compact and condensed exposition; the epos abandons rhythmic\r\nlanguage, and makes use of prose, etc. In these questions of detail\r\nevolution will continue to operate, but there will be no modification\r\nin the fundamental lines of the different modes of expression for human\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nAll amplifications of given artistic frames have hitherto consisted in\r\nthe introduction of new subjects and figures, not in the invention of\r\nnew forms. It was an advance when, instead of the gods and heroes which\r\ntill that time alone had peopled the epic poem, Petronius introduced\r\ninto narrative poetry (_The Banquet of Trimalchio_) the characters of\r\ncontemporary Roman life, or when the Netherlanders of the seventeenth\r\ncentury discovered for painting--which knew of naught save religious\r\nand mythological events, or great proceedings of state--the world of\r\nfairs, popular festivals, and rustic taverns. Quevedo and Mendoza,\r\nwho represent the beggars in the ‘Picaresque’ novel--the model of the\r\nGerman Grimmelshausen writings--Richardson, Fielding, J. J. Rousseau,\r\nwho take as the subject of their novels, instead of extraordinary\r\nadventures, the reflections and emotions of ordinary average beings;\r\nDiderot, who in _Le Fils naturel_ and _Le Père de Famille_ places\r\nhis townspeople on the arrogant French stage, which till then had\r\nonly known insignificant people as figuring in comedies and farces,\r\nbut in serious drama, kings and great lords alone--all these authors\r\ninvented, it is true, no new forms, but gave to old forms a different\r\ncontent from that of tradition. We observe also an advance of this\r\nkind in the poetry and art of our own day. They have given to the\r\nproletariat the rights of citizenship in art and literature. They\r\nshow the labourer, not as a coarse or ridiculous figure, not with\r\nthe object of producing a comic or coarse effect, but as a serious,\r\nfrequently tragic being, worthy of our sympathy. Art is hereby enriched\r\nin the same way as it once was by the introduction of rascals and\r\nadventurers, of a Clarissa, a Tom Jones, a Julie (_Nouvelle Héloïse_),\r\na Werther, a Constance (_Le Fils naturel_), etc., into the circle of\r\nits representations. Nevertheless, when many people in bewilderment\r\nexclaim hereupon, ‘The art of to-morrow will be socialistic!’ they\r\nutter unfathomable nonsense. Socialism is a conception of the laws\r\nwhich ought to determine the production and distribution of property.\r\nWith this, art has nothing to do. Art cannot take any side in politics,\r\nnor is it its business to find and propose solutions to economic\r\nquestions. Its task is to represent the eternally human causes of the\r\nsocialist movement, the suffering of the poor, their yearning after\r\nhappiness, their struggle against hostile forces in Nature and in\r\nthe social mechanism, and their mighty elevation from the abyss into\r\na higher mental and moral atmosphere. When art fulfils this task,\r\nwhen it shows the proletariat how it lives and suffers, how it feels\r\nand aspires, it awakens in us an emotion which becomes the mother of\r\nprojects for alteration, transformation, and reform. It is in exciting\r\nsuch fruitful emotions, and by them the desire to heal the hurt, that\r\nart co-operates with progress, and not by socialist declamations, and\r\nperhaps still less by executing pictures of the state and the society\r\nof the future. Bellamy’s patchwork, _Looking Backward_, is outside art,\r\nand the twentieth century will surely not favour books of this quality.\r\nThe glorification of the proletariat by a Karl Henckell, who practises\r\nwith regard to the fourth estate a more shocking Byzantinism than\r\nwas ever displayed by a tail-wagging courtier to a king, is entirely\r\nincapable of awakening interest and sympathy for the working man.\r\nNeither is true and useful emotion to be expected either by such false\r\nnonsense as, for example, Ludwig Fulda’s _Verlorene Paradies_,[476] or\r\nErnst von Wildenbruch’s _Haubenlerche_.[477] A brave woman like Minna\r\nWettstein-Adelt,[478] who obtains employment as a daily workwoman in a\r\nfactory, and simply relates what she experienced there; a plucky man\r\nof sound sense and a warm heart like Gœhre, who depicts the life of a\r\nfactory-hand according to his own experience;[479] a Gerhart Hauptmann,\r\ntoo, with his closely-observed details in _Die Weber_, do more for the\r\nproletariat than all the Emile Zolas, with their empty theorizing in\r\n_Germinal_ and _L’Argent_, than all the William Morrises, with their\r\nhigh-flown rhymings on the noble workman, who becomes under their\r\npen a caricature of the ‘noble savage’ so much laughed at in the old\r\nnovel-writers on the primeval forests, and yet more still than all the\r\nscribblers who strew their pottage with socialist phrases by way of\r\n‘modern’ seasoning. Mrs. Beecher-Stowe’s _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ did not\r\npreach against slavery, nor risk projects in favour of its suppression.\r\nBut this book has drawn tears from millions of readers, and caused\r\nnegro slavery to be felt as a disgrace to America, and thus contributed\r\nessentially to its abolition. Art and poetry can do for the proletariat\r\nwhat Mrs. Beecher-Stowe has done for the negroes of the United States.\r\nThey cannot and will not do more.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual at present to meet this sentence: ‘The art and\r\npoetry of the future will be scientific.’ Those who say this assume\r\nextraordinarily conceited attitudes, and consider themselves\r\nunmistakably as extremely progressive and ‘modern.’ I ask myself in\r\nvain what these words can mean. Do the good people who mean so well by\r\nscience imagine that sculptors will in the future chisel microscopes\r\nin marble, that painters will depict the circulation of the blood, and\r\nthat poets will display in rich rhymes the principles of Euclid? Even\r\nthis would not be science, but merely a mechanical occupation with the\r\nexternal apparatus of science. But this will surely not occur. In the\r\npast a confusion between art and science was possible; in the future\r\nit is unimaginable. The mental activity of man is too highly developed\r\nfor such an amalgamation. Art and poetry have emotion for their object,\r\nscience has knowledge. The former are subjective, the latter objective.\r\nThe former work with the imagination, _i.e._, with the association of\r\nideas directed by emotion; the latter works with observation, _i.e._,\r\nwith the association of ideas determined by sense-impressions, of which\r\nthe acquisition and reinforcement are the work of attention. Province,\r\nobject, and method in art and science are so different, and in part\r\nso opposed, that to confuse them would signify a retrogression of\r\nthousands of years. One thing only is correct: the images issuing from\r\nthe old anthropomorphic conception, the allusions to obsolete states of\r\nthings and ideas which Fritz Mauthner has called ‘dead symbols’--all\r\nthis will disappear from art. I think that in the twentieth century\r\nit will no longer occur to any painter to compose pictures like\r\nGuido Reni’s _Aurora_ in the Rospigliosi Palace, and that a poet\r\nwould be laughed at who should represent the moon looking amorously\r\ninto a pretty girl’s room. The artist is the child of his times, the\r\nconception dominant in the world is his also, and in spite of all\r\nhis tendency to atavism his method of expression is that with which\r\ncontemporary culture furnishes him. No doubt the art of the future will\r\navoid more than hitherto the great errors in universally recognised\r\ndoctrines of science, but it will never become science.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of pleasure which a man receives from art result from the\r\ngratification of three different organic inclinations or tendencies. He\r\nneeds the incitement which the variety offers him; he takes pleasure\r\nin recognising the originals in the imitations; he represents to\r\nhimself the feelings of his fellow-creatures, and shares in them. He\r\nfinds variety in works transporting him into wholly different scenes\r\nfrom those he knows, and which are familiar to him. The pleasurable\r\nfeeling of recognition he obtains by the careful imitations of familiar\r\nrealities. His sympathy makes him share with lively personal emotions\r\nevery strongly and clearly expressed emotion of the artist. There\r\nwill always be in the future, as heretofore, amateurs of works of\r\nimagination, which transport the reader or spectator into remote times\r\nand countries, or relate extraordinary adventures; others will prefer\r\nworks in which the faithful observation of the known will prevail; the\r\nmost refined and the most advanced will find pleasure only in those\r\nin which a soul, with its most secret feelings and thoughts, reveals\r\nitself. The art of the future will not be wholly romantic, wholly\r\nrealistic, or wholly individualistic, but will appeal from first to\r\nlast as much by its story to curiosity, as by imitation to the pleasure\r\nof recognition, and by the externalism of the artist’s personality to\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nTwo tendencies which have long been rivals will presumably contend\r\nstill more violently in the future for supremacy, viz., observation\r\nand the free flight of imagination, or, to speak more briefly, though\r\nmore inaccurately, realism and romanticism. Good artists, doubtless,\r\nin consequence of their higher mental development, will always be more\r\nprone and more apt accurately to perceive and accurately to interpret\r\nthe phenomena of the world. But the crowd will no less certainly demand\r\nof artists in the future something different from the average reality\r\nof the world. Among creators, the desire for realism will exist, as\r\namong recipients, the need of romanticism. For--and this seems to be\r\nan important point--the task of art in the coming century, will be\r\nto exert over men that charm of variety which reality will no longer\r\noffer, and which the brain cannot relinquish. All that is called\r\n‘picturesque’ will necessarily disappear more and more from the earth.\r\nCivilization ever becomes more uniform. The distinctive is felt as an\r\ninconvenience by those who are marked by it, and got rid of. Ruins\r\ndelight a foreigner’s eye, but they inconvenience the native, and he\r\nsweeps them away. The traveller is disgusted at seeing the beauty of\r\nVenice profaned by steamers, but for the Venetian it is a benefit\r\nto cover long distances quickly for ten centesimi. Soon the last\r\nRedskin will wear a frock-coat and tall hat; the regulation railway\r\nbuildings will display their prosaic outlines and hues along the great\r\nwall of China and under the palm-trees of Tuggurt in the Sahara; and\r\nMacaulay’s celebrated Maori will no longer contemplate the ruins of\r\nWestminster, but a trashy imitation of the palace at Westminster will\r\nserve as a Maori House of Parliament. The unique Yosemite Park, which\r\nthe Americans in their very wise foresight wish to preserve intact in\r\nits prehistoric wildness, will not satisfy the craving for something\r\nnew, different, picturesque, romantic, which humanity demands, and\r\nthe latter will claim from art what civilization--clean, curled, and\r\nsmart--will no longer offer.\r\n\r\nI can now sum up in a few words my prognosis. The hysteria of the\r\npresent day will not last. People will recover from their present\r\nfatigue. The feeble, the degenerate, will perish; the strong will\r\nadapt themselves to the acquisitions of civilizations, or will\r\nsubordinate them to their own organic capacity. The aberrations of\r\nart have no future. They will disappear when civilized humanity shall\r\nhave triumphed over its exhausted condition. The art of the twentieth\r\ncentury will connect itself at every point with the past, but it will\r\nhave a new task to accomplish--that of introducing a stimulating\r\nvariety into the uniformity of civilized life, an influence which\r\nprobably science alone will be in a position to exert, many centuries\r\nlater, over the great majority of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS it possible to accelerate the recovery of the cultivated classes\r\nfrom the present derangement of their nervous system?\r\n\r\nI seriously believe it to be so, and for that reason alone I undertook\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nNo one, I hope, will think me childish enough to imagine that I can\r\nbring degenerates to reason by incontrovertibly and convincingly\r\ndemonstrating to them the derangement of their minds. He whose\r\nprofession brings him into frequent contact with the insane knows\r\nthe utter hopelessness of attempting by persuasion or argument to\r\nbring them to a recognition of the unreality and morbidness of their\r\ndelusions. The only result attained is that they regard the physician\r\neither as an enemy and persecutor, and fiercely hate him, or as a\r\nblockhead devoid of reason on whom they vent their derision.\r\n\r\nIt is equally vain to preach to fanatics of the insane tendencies\r\nof fashions in art and literature, on their enthusiasm for error\r\nand foolishness. These fanatics, without being actually momentarily\r\ndiseased, are yet on the border-line of insanity. They do not and\r\ncannot believe it. For the works, the madness of which is at the\r\nfirst glance apparent to every rational being, actually afford them\r\nfeelings of pleasure. These works are an expression of their own mental\r\nderangement, and of the perversion of their own instincts. In the\r\nperusal, or contemplation of these productions, the half-witted fall\r\ninto a state of excitation which they hold to be æsthetic, but which is\r\nreally sensual; and this sensation is so genuine and immediate, they\r\nare so sure of it, that they can feel only annoyance at or pity for him\r\nwho would make it plain to them that these works evoke no pleasure,\r\nbut only disgust and contempt. To an habitual drinker it is possible\r\nto prove that absinthe is pernicious, but it is absolutely impossible\r\nto convince him that it has a disagreeable taste. To him, indeed, it\r\ntastes seductively delicious. It is in vain that the psychiatrical\r\ncritic assures the patient that this book, that picture, are horrible\r\ndeliriums; the invalid will in good faith reply: ‘Deliriums? That may\r\nbe. But abhorrent? That I can never believe. I know better. They move\r\nme deeply and delightfully, and nothing you can say can prevent their\r\ndoing so!’ Those whose minds are more unhinged go still further, and\r\nsay bluntly: ‘We feel in all our nerves the beauty of these works. You\r\ndo not; so much the worse for you. Instead of perceiving that you are a\r\nbarbarian, devoid of intelligence, and an obtuse Philistine, you wish\r\nto argue us out of our most positive sensations. The only delirious\r\nperson here is yourself.’\r\n\r\nThe history of civilization teaches to satiety, that delusions awaken\r\nardent enthusiasm, and during hundreds or thousands of years obtain\r\nan invincible mastery of the thought and feeling of millions, because\r\nthey vouchsafe a satisfaction, unhealthy though it be, to an existing\r\ninstinct. Against that which procures feelings of pleasure for man, the\r\nobjections of reason are unavailing.\r\n\r\nThose degenerates, whose mental derangement is too deep-seated, must be\r\nabandoned to their inexorable fate. They are past cure or amelioration.\r\nThey will rave for a season, and then perish. This book is obviously\r\nnot written for them. It is, however, possible to reduce the disease\r\nof the age ‘to its anatomical necessity’ (to use the excellent\r\nexpression of German medical science), and to this end every effort\r\nmust be directed. For in addition to those whose organic constitution\r\nirrevocably condemns them to such a fate, the present degenerate\r\ntendencies are pursued by many who are only victims to fashion and\r\ncertain cunning impostures, and these misguided ones we may hope to\r\nlead back to right paths. If, on the other hand, they were to be\r\npassively abandoned to the influences of graphomaniacal fools and their\r\nimbecile or unscrupulous bodyguard of critics, the inevitable result of\r\nsuch a neglect of duty would be a much more rapid and violent outspread\r\nof the mental contagion, and civilized humanity would with much greater\r\ndifficulty, and much more slowly, recover from the disease of the age\r\nthan it might under a strong and resolute combat with the evil.\r\n\r\nThose persons, on whose minds it is above all necessary to impress the\r\nfact that the current tendencies are a result of mental degeneration\r\nand hysteria, are the slightly affected and the healthy, who allow\r\nthemselves to be deluded by cunningly-devised catch-words, or who,\r\nthrough heedless curiosity, flock where they see a crowd. Certain\r\ncritics have thought to intimidate me into speechlessness by saying:\r\n‘If the indications cited are a proof of degeneration and mental\r\ndisease, then is art and poetry in general the work of fools and\r\ndegenerates, even such as has, without reservation, been hitherto\r\nadmired, for in this likewise there are to be met the marks of\r\ndegeneration.’ To which I reply: If scientific criticism, which tests\r\nworks of art according to the principles of psychiatry and psychology,\r\nshould result in showing that all artistic activity is diseased, that\r\nwould still prove nothing against the correctness of my critical\r\nmethod. It would only be the acquisition of fresh knowledge. It would,\r\ndoubtless, destroy a charming delusion, and prove painful to many;\r\nbut science ought not to be checked by the consideration that its\r\nresults annihilate agreeable errors, and frighten the easy-going out\r\nof comfortable habits of thought. Faith, again, is another sovereign\r\nbesides art; it has rendered quite other services to humanity at a\r\ncertain stage of evolution, has otherwise consoled and raised it, given\r\nit other ideals, and advanced it morally in a different way from even\r\nthe greatest geniuses of art. Science, nevertheless, has not hesitated\r\nto pronounce faith a subjective error of man, and would, therefore,\r\nsuffer far fewer scruples in characterizing art as something morbid\r\nif facts should convince it that such was the case. Moreover, not all\r\nthat is morbid is necessarily ugly and pernicious. The expectoration\r\nof a sufferer from lung disease is quite as much a diseased secretion\r\nas the pearl. Is the pearl made more ugly or the expectoration more\r\nbeautiful by the fact that they have the same origin? The toxine of\r\nsausage-meat is the excretion of a bacterium, that of ethyl-alcohol the\r\nsecretion from a fungus. Is the similarity of genesis the condition\r\nof equal value for enjoyment in a poisoned sausage and a glass of old\r\nRhine wine? It would prove nothing in regard to Tolstoi’s _Kreutzer\r\nSonata_ or Ibsen’s _Rosmersholm_ if it were of necessity admitted\r\nthat Goethe’s _Werther_ suffers from irrational eroticism, and that\r\nthe _Divina Commedia_ and _Faust_ are symbolic poems. The whole\r\nobjection, indeed, proceeds from a non-recognition of the simplest\r\nbiological facts. The difference between disease and health is not one\r\nof kind, but of quantity. There is only one kind of vital activity\r\nof the cells and of the cell-systems or organs. It is the same in\r\ndisease and in health. It is sometimes accelerated, and sometimes\r\nretarded; and when this deviation from the rule is detrimental to\r\nthe ends of the whole organism, we call it disease. As it is here a\r\nquestion of more or less, it is impossible to define their limits\r\nsharply. Extreme cases are naturally easily recognised. But who shall\r\ndetermine with accuracy the exact point at which deviation from the\r\nnormal, _i.e._, from health, begins? The insane brain performs its\r\nfunctions according to precisely the same laws as the rational brain,\r\nbut it obeys these laws either imperfectly or excessively. In every\r\nhuman being there exists the tendency to interpret sense-impressions\r\nfalsely. It is diseased only when exhibited in extraordinary strength.\r\nThe traveller in a railway carriage has an illusory perception of\r\nthe landscape flying by him while he is sitting still. The sufferer\r\nfrom the delusion of persecutions imagines that someone is wafting\r\nhim evil odours, or hurling currents of electricity at him. Both of\r\nthese ideas rest on sense-illusions. Are both for that reason marks\r\nof insanity? The traveller and the paranoist commit the same error\r\nof thought, and, nevertheless, the former is perfectly sane, and the\r\nlatter deranged in mind. It may therefore with perfect security be\r\naffirmed that certain peculiarities--such as intense emotionalism,\r\nthe tendency to symbolism, the predominance of imagination--are to\r\nbe met with in all true artists. That all should be degenerates is\r\nvery far from being a necessary consequence of this. It is only the\r\nexaggeration of these peculiarities which constitutes a disease. The\r\nsole conclusion justified by their regular appearance in artists would\r\nbe that art, without being properly a disease of the human mind, is yet\r\nan incipient, slight deviation from perfect health; and I should raise\r\nno objection to this conclusion, the less so because it in no way helps\r\nthe case of real degenerates and their distinctly diseased works. But\r\nit is not enough to prove that mysticism, ego-mania, and the pessimism\r\nof realism are forms of mental derangement. All the seductive masks\r\nmust be torn from these tendencies, and their real aspect be shown in\r\nits grinning nakedness.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to healthy art, which they deride as musty and\r\nantiquated, they pretend to represent youth. An ill-advised criticism\r\nhas actually been caught by their lime, and emphasizes their youth\r\nwith constant irony. What clumsiness! As if any effort in the world\r\ncould deprive of its charm the word ‘young,’ this essential notion\r\nof all that is blooming and fresh, this note of the dawn and the\r\nspring, and transform it into a term of reproach and insult! The truth\r\nis, however, that degenerates are not only not young, but that they\r\nare weirdly senile. Senile is their splenetic calumniation of the\r\nworld and life; senile are their babblings, drivellings, ravings and\r\ndivagations; senile their impotent appetites, and their cravings for\r\nall the stimulants of exhaustion. To be young is to hope; to be young\r\nis to love simply and naturally; to be young is to rejoice in one’s\r\nown health and strength, and in that of all human beings, and of the\r\nbirds of the air and the beetles in the grass; and of these qualities\r\nthere is not one to be met with among the youth-simulating, decayed\r\ndegenerates.\r\n\r\nThey have the name of liberty on their lips when they proclaim as their\r\ngod their corrupt self, and call it progress when they extol crime,\r\ndeny morality, raise altars to instinct, scoff at science, and hold\r\nup loafing æstheticism as the sole aim of life. But their invocation\r\nof liberty is shameless blasphemy. How can there be a question of\r\nliberty when instinct is to be almighty? Let us remember Count Muffat\r\nin Zola’s _Nana_ (p. 491): ‘At other times he was a dog. She threw her\r\nscented handkerchief to the end of the room for him, and he had to run\r\non all fours to pick it up with his teeth. “Fetch it, Cæsar!... Look\r\nout; I’ll give it to you if you’re lazy!... Very good, Cæsar! mind!\r\nnicely!... Sit up!” And as for him, he loved his abasement, revelled\r\nin the joy of being a brute. He wanted to sink still lower; he cried:\r\n“Hit harder.... Bow wow! I am mad; hit me then!”’ That is the liberty\r\nof one who is ‘emancipated’ in the sense of the degenerates! He may\r\nbe a dog, if his crazed instinct commands him to be a dog! And if the\r\n‘emancipated’ one is named Ravachol, and his instinct commands him to\r\nperpetrate the crime of blowing up a house with dynamite, the peaceable\r\ncitizen sleeping in this house is free to fly into the air, and fall\r\nagain to the ground in a bloody rain of shreds of flesh and splinters\r\nof bone. Progress is possible only by the growth of knowledge; but this\r\nis the task of consciousness and judgment, not of instinct. The march\r\nof progress is characterized by the expansion of consciousness and\r\nthe contraction of the unconscious; the strengthening of will and the\r\nweakening of impulsions; the increase of self-responsibility and the\r\nrepression of reckless egoism. He who makes instinct man’s master does\r\nnot wish for liberty, but for the most infamous and abject slavery,\r\nviz., enslavement of the judgment of the individual by his most\r\ninsensate and self-destructive appetites; enslavement of the inflamed\r\nman by the craziest whims of a prostitute; enslavement of the people\r\nby a few stronger and more violent personalities. And he who places\r\npleasure above discipline, and impulse above self-restraint, wishes not\r\nfor progress, but for retrogression to the most primitive animality.\r\n\r\nRetrogression, relapse--this is in general the ideal of this band who\r\ndare to speak of liberty and progress. They wish to be the future.\r\nThat is one of their chief pretensions. That is one of the means by\r\nwhich they catch the largest number of simpletons. We have, however,\r\nseen in all individual cases that it is not the future but the most\r\nforgotten, far-away past. Degenerates lisp and stammer, instead of\r\nspeaking. They utter monosyllabic cries, instead of constructing\r\ngrammatically and syntactically articulated sentences. They draw and\r\npaint like children, who dirty tables and walls with mischievous hands.\r\nThey compose music like that of the yellow natives of East Asia. They\r\nconfound all the arts, and lead them back to the primitive forms they\r\nhad before evolution differentiated them. Every one of their qualities\r\nis atavistic, and we know, moreover, that atavism is one of the most\r\nconstant marks of degeneracy. Lombroso has convincingly demonstrated\r\nthat many peculiarities of the born criminals described by him are\r\nalso atavisms. Over-hasty critics believed that they had discovered a\r\nvery subtle objection when, with a smile of self-satisfaction, they\r\nobjected: ‘You assert that criminal instinct is at once degeneracy\r\nand atavism. These two dicta are mutually exclusive. Degeneracy is\r\na pathological state; the most convincing proof of this is, that\r\nthe degenerate type does not propagate itself, but becomes extinct.\r\nAtavism is a return to an earlier state, which cannot have been\r\ndiseased, because the men who existed under those conditions have\r\ndeveloped themselves and progressed. Return to a healthy, albeit\r\nremote, state cannot possibly be disease.’ All this verbiage has its\r\nsource in the stubborn superstition which sees in disease a state\r\ndiffering essentially from that of health. This is a good example\r\nof the confusion which a word is capable of producing in muddled or\r\nignorant brains. As a matter of fact there exists no activity and\r\nno state of the living organism which can in itself be designated\r\nas ‘health’ or ‘disease.’ But they become these in respect of the\r\ncircumstances and purposes of the organism. According to the time of\r\nits appearance, one and the same state may very well be at one time\r\ndisease and at another health. In the human fœtus, at the sixth week,\r\nhare-lip is a regular and healthy phenomenon. In the newly-born child\r\nit is a malformation. In the first year of its life the child cannot\r\nwalk. Why? Because its legs are too weak to support it? Decidedly\r\nnot. The well-known experiments of Dr. L. Robinson on sixty new born\r\ninfants have proved that they are able to hang by their hands from a\r\nstick for thirty seconds, a performance implying muscular strength\r\nquite as considerable, relatively to their respective ages, as is\r\npossessed by the adult. It is not from weakness that they are unable\r\nto walk, but because their nervous system has not yet learned so to\r\nregulate and combine the activity of the different groups of muscles,\r\nas to produce a purposive movement. Infants cannot yet ‘co-ordinate.’\r\nIncapacity of co-ordination of muscular activity is called by medical\r\nscience ataxy. Hence in infants this is the natural and healthy\r\ncondition. But ataxy precisely is a serious disease when it appears in\r\nadults, as the chief symptom of inflammation of the spinal cord. The\r\nidentity of the ataxy of spinal disease with healthy infantine ataxy\r\nis so complete, that Dr. S. Frenkel[480] was able to found upon it a\r\ntreatment of spinal ataxy, which consisted, essentially, in teaching\r\nthe patients anew, like children, to walk and stand. It is seen,\r\nthen, that a state may be at the same time diseased and yet the mere\r\nreturn to what was primitively a perfectly healthy state of things;\r\nand it was with culpable frivolity that Lombroso was reproached with\r\ncontradiction because he saw in criminal instincts at once degeneracy\r\nand atavism. The disease of degeneracy consists precisely in the fact\r\nthat the degenerate organism has not the power to mount to the height\r\nof evolution already attained by the species, but stops on the way at\r\nan earlier or later point. The relapse of the degenerate may reach to\r\nthe most stupendous depth. As, in reverting to the cleavage of the\r\nsuperior maxillary peculiar to insects with sextuple lips, he sinks\r\nsomatically to the level of fishes, nay to that of the arthropoda, or,\r\neven further, to that of rhizopods not yet sexually differentiated; as\r\nby fistulæ of the neck he reverts to the branchiæ of the lowest fishes,\r\nthe selacious; or by excess in the number of fingers (polydactylia)\r\nto the multiple-rayed fins of fishes, perhaps even to the bristles of\r\nworms; or, by hermaphrodism, to the asexuality of rhizopods--so in the\r\nmost favourable case, as a higher degenerate, he renews intellectually\r\nthe type of the primitive man of the most remote Stone Age; or, in the\r\nworst case, as an idiot, that of an animal far anterior to man.\r\n\r\nThis is the subject in regard to which it is our duty untiringly and by\r\nevery means to enlighten the weak in judgment, and the inexperienced.\r\nThe fine names appropriated to themselves by degenerates, their\r\nimitators, and their critical hirelings, are lies and deceit. They are\r\nnot the future, but an immeasurably remote past. They are not progress,\r\nbut the most appalling reaction. They are not liberty, but the most\r\ndisgraceful slavery. They are not youth and the dawn, but the most\r\nexhausted senility, the starless winter night, the grave and corruption.\r\n\r\nIt is the sacred duty of all healthy and moral men to take part in\r\nthe work of protecting and saving those who are not already too deeply\r\ndiseased. Only by each individual doing his duty will it be possible\r\nto dam up the invading mental malady. It is not seemly simply to shrug\r\nthe shoulders and smile contemptuously. While the easy-going console\r\nthemselves by saying, ‘No rational being takes this idiocy seriously,’\r\nmadness and crime are doing their work and poisoning a whole generation.\r\n\r\nMystics, but especially ego-maniacs and filthy pseudo-realists, are\r\nenemies to society of the direst kind. Society must unconditionally\r\ndefend itself against them. Whoever believes with me that society is\r\nthe natural organic form of humanity, in which alone it can exist,\r\nprosper, and continue to develop itself to higher destinies; whoever\r\nlooks upon civilization as a good, having value and deserving to be\r\ndefended, must mercilessly crush under his thumb the anti-social\r\nvermin. To him who, with Nietzsche, is enthusiastic over the\r\n‘freely-roving, lusting beast of prey,’ we cry, ‘Get you gone from\r\ncivilization! Rove far from us! Be a lusting beast of prey in the\r\ndesert! Satisfy yourself! Level your roads, build your huts, clothe and\r\nfeed yourself as you can! Our streets and our houses are not built for\r\nyou; our looms have no stuffs for you; our fields are not tilled for\r\nyou. All our labour is performed by men who esteem each other, have\r\nconsideration for each other, mutually aid each other, and know how to\r\ncurb their selfishness for the general good. There is no place among us\r\nfor the lusting beast of prey; and if you dare return to us, we will\r\npitilessly beat you to death with clubs.’\r\n\r\nAnd still more determined must the resistance be to the filth-loving\r\nherd of swine, the professional pornographists. These have no claim\r\nto the measure of pity which may still be extended to degenerates\r\nproperly so called, as invalids; for they have freely chosen their\r\nvile trade, and prosecute it from cupidity, vanity, and hatred of\r\nlabour. The systematic incitation to lasciviousness causes the gravest\r\ninjury to the bodily and mental health of individuals, and a society\r\ncomposed of individuals sexually over-stimulated, knowing no longer\r\nany self-control, any discipline, any shame, marches to its certain\r\nruin, because it is too worn out and flaccid to perform great tasks.\r\nThe pornographist poisons the springs whence flows the life of future\r\ngenerations. No task of civilization has been so painfully laborious as\r\nthe subjugation of lasciviousness. The pornographist would take from\r\nus the fruit of this, the hardest struggle of humanity. To him we must\r\nshow no mercy.\r\n\r\nThe police cannot aid us. The public prosecutor and criminal judge\r\nare not the proper protectors of society against crime committed\r\nwith pen and crayon. They infuse into their mode of proceeding too\r\nmuch consideration for interests not always, not necessarily, those\r\nof cultivated and moral men. The policeman is so often compelled to\r\nintervene in the service of a privileged class, of the insupportable\r\narrogance of administrations, of the assumption of infallibility of\r\nministers and other government officials of the most unworthy byzantism\r\nand of the most stupid superstition, that he does not dishonour the\r\nman on whose shoulder he lays his heavy hand. Hence it comes to this,\r\nthat the pornographist must be branded with infamy. But the punitive\r\nsentence of a judge does not with certainty have this effect.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of works trading on unchastity must emanate from men\r\nof whose freedom from prejudice and freedom of mind, intelligence\r\nand independence, no one entertains a doubt. The word of such men\r\nwould be of great weight among the people. There already exists an\r\n‘Association of Men for the Suppression of Immorality.’ Unfortunately\r\nit allows itself to be guided not only by solicitude for the moral\r\nhealth and purity of the multitude, and especially of the young\r\nbut by considerations which to the majority of the people seem to\r\nbe prejudices. The association pursues disbelief almost more than\r\nimmorality. An outspoken word against revelation or the Church inspires\r\nthis association with as much horror as an act of obscenity. To this\r\nnarrow-minded confessionalism is it due that its work is less rich\r\nin blessing than it might be. But in spite of this, we can take\r\nthis ‘Association of Men’ as a pattern. Let us do what it does, but\r\nwithout mummeries. Here is a great and grateful task, _e.g._, for\r\nthe new ‘Society for Ethical Culture’ of Berlin: Let it constitute\r\nitself the voluntary guardian of the people’s morality. Doubtless the\r\npornographists will attempt to turn it into ridicule. But the scorn\r\nwill soon enough stick in their own throats. An association composed of\r\nthe people’s leaders and instructors, professors, authors, members of\r\nParliament, judges, high functionaries, has the power to exercise an\r\nirresistible boycott. Let the ‘Society for Ethical Culture’ undertake\r\nto examine into the morality of artistic and literary productions.\r\nIts composition would be a guarantee that the examination would not\r\nbe narrow-minded, not prudish, and not canting. Its members have\r\nsufficient culture and taste to distinguish the thoughtlessness of\r\na morally healthy artist from the vile speculation of a scribbling\r\nruffian. When such a society, which would be joined by those men from\r\nthe people who are the best fitted for this task, should, after serious\r\ninvestigation and in the consciousness of a heavy responsibility, say\r\nof a man, ‘He is a criminal!’ and of a work, ‘It is a disgrace to our\r\nnation!’ work and man would be annihilated. No respectable bookseller\r\nwould keep the condemned book; no respectable paper would mention it,\r\nor give the author access to its columns; no respectable family would\r\npermit the branded work to be in their house; and the wholesome dread\r\nof this fate would very soon prevent the appearance of such books\r\nas Bahr’s _Gute Schule_, and would dishabituate the ‘realists’ from\r\nparading a condemnation based on a crime against morality as a mark of\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nMedical specialists of insanity have likewise failed to understand\r\ntheir duty. It is time for them to come to the front. ‘It is a\r\nprejudice,’ Bianchi most justly says,[481] ‘to believe that psychiatry\r\nmust be enclosed within a sanctuary like that at Mecca.’ It is no\r\ndoubt meritorious to indurate sections of the spinal cord in chromic\r\nacid, and tint them in a neutrophyllic solution, but this should not\r\nexhaust the activity of a professor of psychiatry. Neither is it\r\nsufficient that he should in addition give a few lectures to jurists,\r\nand publish observations in technical journals. Let him speak to the\r\nmass of cultivated persons who are neither physicians nor learned in\r\nlaw. Let him enlighten them in general publications and in accessible\r\nconferences concerning the leading facts in mental therapeutics. Let\r\nhim show them the mental derangement of degenerate artists and authors,\r\nand teach them that the works in fashion are written and painted\r\ndelirium. In all other branches of medical science it is discerned\r\nthat hygiene is of more importance than therapeutics, and that the\r\npublic health has much more to expect from prophylactics than from\r\ntreatment. With us in Germany the psychiatrist alone fails as yet to\r\nconcern himself with the hygiene of the mind. It is time that he should\r\npractise his profession in this direction also. A Maudsley in England,\r\na Charcot, a Magnan in France, a Lombroso, a Tonnini in Italy, have\r\nbrought to vast circles of the people an understanding of the obscure\r\nphenomena in the life of the mind, and disseminated knowledge which\r\nwould make it impossible in those countries for pronounced lunatics\r\nwith the mania for persecution to gain an influence over hundreds of\r\nthousands of electoral citizens,[482] even if it could not prevent\r\nthe coming into fashion of the degenerate art. In Germany alone no\r\npsychiatrist has as yet followed this example. It is time to atone\r\nfor this negligence. Popularized expositions from the pens of experts\r\nwhose prominent official status would recommend them to the reader\r\nwould restrain many healthy spirits from affiliating themselves with\r\ndegenerate tendencies.\r\n\r\nSuch is the treatment of the disease of the age which I hold to be\r\nefficacious: Characterization of the leading degenerates as mentally\r\ndiseased; unmasking and stigmatizing of their imitators as enemies to\r\nsociety; cautioning the public against the lies of these parasites.\r\n\r\nWe in particular, who have made it our life’s task to combat antiquated\r\nsuperstition, to spread enlightenment, to demolish historical ruins and\r\nremove their rubbish, to defend the freedom of the individual against\r\nState oppression and the mechanical routine of the Philistine; we must\r\nresolutely set ourselves in opposition to the miserable mongers who\r\nseize upon our dearest watchwords, with which to entrap the innocent.\r\nThe ‘freedom’ and ‘modernity,’ the ‘progress’ and ‘truth,’ of these\r\nfellows are not ours. We have nothing in common with them. They wish\r\nfor self-indulgence; we wish for work. They wish to drown consciousness\r\nin the unconscious; we wish to strengthen and enrich consciousness.\r\nThey wish for evasive ideation and babble; we wish for attention,\r\nobservation, and knowledge. The criterion by which true moderns may\r\nbe recognised and distinguished from impostors calling themselves\r\nmoderns may be this: Whoever preaches absence of discipline is an enemy\r\nof progress; and whoever worships his ‘I’ is an enemy to society.\r\nSociety has for its first premise, neighbourly love and capacity for\r\nself-sacrifice; and progress is the effect of an ever more rigorous\r\nsubjugation of the beast in man, of an ever tenser self-restraint, an\r\never keener sense of duty and responsibility. The emancipation for\r\nwhich we are striving is of the judgment, not of the appetites. In the\r\nprofoundly penetrating words of Scripture (Matt. v. 17), ‘Think not\r\nthat I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets; I am not come to\r\ndestroy, but to fulfil.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n           BILLING AND SONS, PRINTERS, GUILDFORD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This passage has been misunderstood. It has been taken to mean\r\nthat all the French nation had degenerated, and their race was\r\napproaching its end. However, from the concluding paragraph of this\r\nchapter, it may be clearly seen that I had in my eye only the upper\r\nten thousand. The peasant population, and a part of the working\r\nclasses and the _bourgeoisie_, are sound. I assert only the decay of\r\nthe rich inhabitants of great cities and the leading classes. It is\r\nthey who have discovered _fin-de-siècle_, and it is to them also that\r\n_fin-de-race_ applies.\r\n\r\n[2] ‘My thought I hasten to fulfil.’\r\n\r\n[3] A four-act comedy, by H. Micard and F. de Jouvenot, named\r\n_Fin-de-Siècle_, which was played in Paris in 1890, hardly avails to\r\ndetermine the sense of the word as the French use it. The authors were\r\nconcerned, not to depict a phase of the age or a psychological state,\r\nbut only to give an attractive title to their piece.\r\n\r\n[4] _Traité des Dégénérescences physiques, intellectuelles et morales\r\nde l’Espèce humaine et des Causes qui produisent ces Variétés\r\nmaladives._ Par le Dr. B.

The murderer was an\r\nepileptic, and a ‘degenerate,’ in the Morelian sense. His family\r\nsummoned Morel from Normandy to Munich, for the purpose of proving\r\nto the jury, before whom the case (1868) was tried, that the accused\r\nwas irresponsible. The latter was singularly indignant at this; and\r\nthe Attorney-General also contradicted, in the most emphatic manner,\r\nthe evidence of the French alienist, and supported himself by the\r\napprobation of the most prominent alienists in Munich. Chorinsky\r\nwas pronounced guilty. Nevertheless, only a short time after his\r\nconviction, insanity developed itself in him, and a few months later he\r\ndied, in the deepest mental darkness, thus justifying all the previous\r\nassertions of the French physician, who had, in the German tongue,\r\ndemonstrated to a German jury the incompetence of his professional\r\nconfrères in Munich.\r\n\r\n[6] Morel, _op. cit._, p. 683.\r\n\r\n[7] _L’Uomo delinquente in rapporto all’ Antropologia, Giurisprudenza\r\ne alle Discipline carcerarie._ 3ª edizione.

In this\r\nvery remarkable study by the Parisian Professor, the following\r\npassage appears: ‘What will these [those remaining stationary in\r\ntheir development] young Parisians become by-and-by? Incapable of\r\naccomplishing a long and conscientious work, they excel, as a rule, in\r\nartistic activities. If they are painters they are stronger in colour\r\nthan in drawing. If they are poets, the flow of their verses assures\r\ntheir success rather than the vigour of the thought.’\r\n\r\n[57] The 26 German towns which to-day have more than 100,000\r\ninhabitants, numbered altogether, in 1891, 6,000,000, and in 1835,\r\n1,400,000. The 31 English towns of this category, in 1891, 10,870,000;\r\nin 1841, 4,590,000; the 11 French towns, in 1891, 4,180,000; in 1836,\r\n1,710,000. It should be remarked that about a third of these 68 towns\r\nhad not in 1840 as many generally as 100,000 inhabitants. To-day,\r\nin the large towns in Germany, France, and England, there reside\r\n21,050,000 individuals, while in 1840 only 4,800,000 were living under\r\nthese conditions.

The case, nevertheless, is not so simple as Ferrier\r\nsees it to be. A portion of the energy which is set free by the\r\nperipheral stimulus in the cells of the cortex of the frontal lobes\r\ncertainly transmutes itself into a motor impulse, even if the immediate\r\nstimulation of the anterior brain releases no muscular contractions.\r\nBut this is not the place to defend this point against Ferrier.\r\n\r\n[70] A. Herzen is the author of the hypothesis that consciousness\r\nis connected with the destruction of organic connections in the\r\nbrain-cells, and the restoration of this connection with rest, sleep,\r\nand unconsciousness. All we know of the chemical composition of the\r\nsecretions in sleeping and waking points to the correctness of this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n[71]\r\n\r\n  ‘One tread moves a thousand threads,\r\n  The shuttles dart to and fro,\r\n  The threads flow on invisible,\r\n  One stroke sets up a thousand ties.’\r\n\r\n\r\n[72] Karl Abel, _Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworte_.

It has been lately denied that\r\nthere are any nerves of vascular dilatation (_inter alia_ by Dr. Morat,\r\n_La Semaine médicale_, 1892, p. 112). But the effect may be the same\r\nin both cases. For through the contraction of the vessels in a single\r\nbrain-circuit, the dislodged blood would be driven to other portions of\r\nthe brain, and these would experience a greater access of blood, just\r\nas if their vessels were actively dilated.\r\n\r\n[76] When I wrote these words I was under the impression that I was\r\nthe sole originator of the physiological theory of attention therein\r\nset forth. Since the appearance of this book, however, I have read\r\nAlfred Lehmann’s work, _Die Hypnose und die damit verwandten normalen\r\nZustände_, Leipzig, 1890, and have there (pp. 27 _et seq._) found\r\nmy theory in almost identical words. Lehmann, then, published it\r\ntwo years before I did, which fact I here duly acknowledge. That we\r\narrived at this conclusion independently of each other would testify\r\nthat the hypothesis of vaso-motor reflex action is really explanatory.\r\nWundt (_Hypnotismus und Suggestion_, Leipzig, 1892, pp. 27-30), it\r\nis true, criticises Lehmann’s work, but he seems to agree with this\r\nhypothesis--which is also mine--or, at least, raises no objection to it.\r\n\r\n[77] _Brain_, January, 1886, quoted by Ribot, _Psychologie de\r\nl’Attention_, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[78] Ribot, _op. cit._, pp. 106 and 119.\r\n\r\n[79] Legrain, _op. cit._, p. 177.\r\n\r\n[80] _Ibid._, p. 156.\r\n\r\n[81] In the chapter which treats of French Neomystics, I shall give a\r\ncluster of such disconnected and mutually exclusive expressions, which\r\nare quite parallel with the instances cited by Legrain, of the manner\r\nof speech among those acknowledged to be of weak mind. In this place\r\nonly one passage may be repeated from the V^{te} E. M. de Vogué, _Le\r\nRoman Russe_, Paris, 1888, in which this mystical author, unconsciously\r\nand involuntarily, characterizes admirably the shadowiness and\r\nemptiness of mystic diction, while praising it as something superior.\r\n‘One trait,’ he says (p. 215), ‘they’ (certain Russian authors) ‘have\r\nin common, viz., the art of awakening series of feelings and thoughts\r\nby a line, a word, by endless re-echoings [_résonnances_].... The words\r\nyou read on this paper appear to be written, not in length, but in\r\ndepth. They leave behind them a train of faint reverberations, which\r\nare gradually lost, no one knows where.’ And p. 227: ‘They see men\r\nand things in the gray light of earliest dawn. The weakly indicated\r\noutlines end in a confused and clouded “perhaps.” ...’\r\n\r\n[82] ‘It is certain that the Beautiful never has such charms for\r\nus as when we read it attentively in a language which we only half\r\nunderstand. It is the ambiguity, the uncertainty, _i.e._. the\r\npliability of words, which is one of their greatest advantages, and\r\nrenders it possible to make an exact [!] use of them.’--Joubert, quoted\r\nby Charles Morice, _La Littérature de tout-à-l’heure_. Paris, 1889, p.\r\n171.\r\n\r\n[83] Gérard de Nerval, _Le Rêve et la Vie_, Paris, 1868, p. 53:\r\n‘Everything in Nature assumed a different aspect. Mysterious voices\r\nissued from plants, trees, animals, the smallest insects, to warn and\r\nto encourage me. I discerned mysterious turns in the utterances of my\r\ncompanions, and understood their purport. Even formless and inanimate\r\nthings ministered to the workings of my mind.’ Here is a perfect\r\ninstance of that ‘comprehension of the mysterious’ which is one of the\r\nmost common fancies of the insane.\r\n\r\n[84] An imbecile degenerate, the history of whose illness is related by\r\nDr. G. Ballet, said: ‘Il y a mille ans que le monde est monde. Milan,\r\nla cathédrale de Milan’ (_La Semaine médicale_, 1892, p. 133). ‘Mille\r\nans’ (a thousand years) calls up in his consciousness the like-sounding\r\nword ‘Milan,’ although there is absolutely no rational connection\r\nbetween the two ideas. A graphomaniac named Jasno, whose case is\r\ncited by Lombroso, says ‘la main se mène’ (the hand guides itself).\r\nHe then begins to speak of ‘semaine’ (week), and continues to play\r\nupon the like-sounding words ‘se mène,’ ‘semaine,’ and ‘main’ (_Genie\r\nund Irsinn_, p. 264). In the book of a German graphomaniac entitled\r\n_Rembrandt als Erzieher_, Leipzig, 1890 (a book which I shall have to\r\nrefer to more than once, as an example of the lucubrations of a weak\r\nmind), I find, on the very first pages, the following juxtaposition\r\nof words according to their resemblance in sound: ‘Sie verkünden eine\r\nRückkehr ... zur Einheit und Feinheit’ (p. 3). ‘Je ungeschliffener\r\nJemand ist, desto mehr ist an ihm zu schleifen’ (p. 4). ‘Jede rechte\r\nBildung ist bildend, formend, schöpferisch, und also künstlerisch’ (p.\r\n8). ‘Rembrandt war nicht nur ein protestantischer Künstler, sondern\r\nauch ein künstlerischer Protestant’ (p. 14). ‘Sein Hundert guldenblatt\r\nallein könnte schon als ein Tausendgüldenkraut gegen so mancherlei\r\nSchäden ... dienen’ (p. 23). ‘Christus und Rembrandt haben ... darin\r\netwas Gemeinsames, dass Jener die religiöse, dieser die künstlerische\r\nArmseligkeit--die Seligkeit der Armen--zu ... Ehren bringt’ (p. 25.),\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[85] Dr. Paul Sollier, _Psychologie de l’Idiot et de l’Imbécile_.\r\nParis, 1891, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[86] _Poems by Dante Gabriel Rossetti._ With a memoir of the author by\r\nFranz Hüffer.

It is only when the art of\r\nsculpture no longer exists, or has followed another tendency than that\r\nof representing human bodies--when it has passed, as sculpture, into\r\n_architecture_--when the rigid solitude of this _one_ man carved in\r\nstone will have been resolved into the infinitely flowing plurality of\r\nveritable, living men ... it is only then, too, that _real plastic_\r\nwill exist.’ And on p. 182: ‘That which it [painting] _honestly_ exerts\r\nitself to attain, it attains in ... greatest perfection ... when it\r\ndescends from canvas and chalk to ascend to the _tragic stage_....\r\nBut landscape-painting will become, as the last and most finished\r\nconclusion of all the fine arts, the life-giving soul, properly\r\nspeaking, of architecture; it will teach us thus to organize the\r\n_stage_ for works of the dramatic art of the future, in which, itself\r\nliving, it will represent the warm _background_ of _nature_ for the use\r\nof the _living_, and not for the imitated _man_.’\r\n\r\n[190] Richard Wagner, _Gesammelte Schriften und Dichtungen_.

A French admirer of\r\nWhitman, Gabriel Sarrazin (_La Renaissance de la Poésie anglaise_,\r\n1798-1889; Paris, 1889, p. 270, foot-note), palliates this proof of\r\norganic instability and weakness of will in the following manner:\r\n‘This American facility of changing from one calling to another goes\r\nagainst our old European prejudices, and our unalterable veneration for\r\nthoroughly hierarchical, bureaucratic routine-careers. We have remained\r\nin this, as in so many other respects, essentially narrow-minded, and\r\ncannot understand that diversity of capacities gives a man a very\r\nmuch greater social value.’ This is the true method of the æsthetic\r\nwind-bag, who for every fact which he does not understand finds\r\nroundly-turned phrases with which he explains and justifies everything\r\nto his own satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[227] Walt Whitman, _Leaves of Grass_; a new edition.

Jena, 1889.\r\n\r\n[238] ‘Certain [sick] persons enjoy keenly a sense of the lightness of\r\ntheir body, feel themselves hovering in the air, believe they could\r\nfly; or else they have a feeling of weight either in the whole body, in\r\nmany limbs, or in one single limb, which seems to them huge and heavy.\r\nA young epileptic sometimes felt his body so extraordinarily heavy that\r\nhe could scarcely raise it. At other times he felt himself so light\r\nthat he believed he did not touch the ground. Sometimes it seemed to\r\nhim that his body had assumed such proportions that it was impossible\r\nfor him to pass through a door.

Although he receives nothing\r\nmore from outside, and his personality is completely isolated from\r\nthe surroundings in which he is placed, he may be seen to go, come,\r\ndo, act, as if he had his senses and intelligence in full exercise.’\r\nThis, it is true, is the description of a patient, but what he says of\r\nthe latter applies equally, with a difference of degree only, to the\r\nego-maniac. Féré has communicated to the Biological Society of Paris,\r\nin the séance of November 12, 1892, the results of a great number of\r\nexperiments made by him, whence it appears ‘that among the greater\r\npart of epileptics, hysterical and degenerate subjects, cutaneous\r\nsensibility is diminished.’ See _La Semaine médicale_, 1892, p. 456.\r\n\r\n[245] Alfred Binet, _Les Altérations de la Personnalité_.

Binet, _Les\r\nAltérations de la Personnalité_, p. 208.\r\n\r\n[247] This is not merely a simple hypothesis, but a well-demonstrated\r\nfact. Hundreds of experiments by Boeck, Weill, Moebius, Charrin,\r\nMairet, Bosc, Slosse, Laborde, Marie, etc., have established that\r\namong the deranged, during periods of excitation and afterwards, the\r\nurine is more toxic, _i.e._, more full of waste and excreted organic\r\nmatter, while after the periods of depression it is less toxic, _i.e._,\r\npoorer in disaggregated matter, than among sane individuals, which\r\nproves that, among the former, the nutrition of the tissues is morbidly\r\nincreased or retarded.\r\n\r\n[248] Dr. Paul Moreau, of Tours, describes perversion (_l’aberration_)\r\nin these somewhat obscure terms: ‘Perversion constitutes a deviation\r\nfrom the laws which rule the proper sensibility of the organs and\r\nfaculties. By this word we mean to designate those cases in which\r\nobservation testifies to an unnatural, exceptional, and wholly\r\npathological change, a change carrying palpable disturbance into the\r\nregular working of a faculty.’--_Des Aberrations du Sens génésique_.\r\n4^e édition. Paris, 1887, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[249] ‘The vices of the psycho-physical organization manifesting\r\nthemselves by acts prohibited, not only by morality--that aggregate of\r\nnecessary rules elaborated by the secular experience of peoples--but\r\nalso by their penal codes, are in discord with life in society,\r\nin the midst of which humanity can alone make progress.... A man,\r\nfrom his birth adapted to social life, can only acquire such vices\r\nas a consequence of certain pernicious conditions, through which\r\nhis psycho-physical powers are set in opposition to the necessary\r\nexigencies of social life.’--Drill, _Les Criminels mineurs_, quoted by\r\nLombroso in _Les Applications de l’Anthropologie criminelle_. Paris,\r\n1892, p. 94. See also G. Tarde, _La Philosophie pénale_, Lyon, 1890,\r\n_passim_; ‘The morally deranged are not true lunatics. A Marquise de\r\nBrinvilliers, a Troppmann, a being born without either compassion or\r\nsense of shame--can it be said of such an one that he is not himself\r\nwhen he commits his crime? No. He is only too much himself. But his\r\nexistence, his person, are hostile to society. He does not feel the\r\nsame sentiments which we civilized people regard as indispensable. It\r\nis useless to think of curing him or of reforming him.’\r\n\r\n[250] Darwinism explains adaptation only as the result of the struggle\r\nfor existence, and of selection which is a form of this struggle. In\r\none individual a quality appears accidentally, which makes it more\r\ncapable of preserving itself and of conquering its enemies than those\r\nindividuals not born with this quality. It finds more favourable\r\nconditions of existence, leaves behind it more numerous descendants\r\ninheriting this advantageous quality, and by the survival of the\r\nfittest and the disappearance of the less fit, the whole species comes\r\ninto the possession of this advantageous quality. I do not at all deny\r\nthat an accidental individual deviation from the type of the species,\r\nwhich proves an advantage in the struggle for existence, can be a\r\nsource of transformations having as their result a better adaptation\r\nof the species to given and unmodifiable circumstances. But I do not\r\nbelieve that such an accident is the only source, or even the most\r\nfrequent source, of such transformations. The process of adaptation\r\nappears to me to be quite otherwise, viz., the living being experiences\r\nin some situation feelings of discomfort from which he wishes to\r\nescape, either by change of situation (movement, flight), or by trying\r\nto act vigorously on the causes of these feelings of discomfort\r\n(attack, modification of natural conditions). If the organs possessed\r\nby the living being, and the aptitude these organs have acquired,\r\nare not sufficient to furnish the counteractions felt and wished for\r\nas necessary to those feelings of discomfort, the weaker creatures\r\nsubmit to their destiny, and suffer or even perish. More vigorous\r\nindividuals, on the contrary, make violent and continuous efforts in\r\norder to attain their design, of flight, defence, attack, suppression\r\nof natural obstacles; they give strong nervous impulses to their organs\r\nto increase to the highest degree their functional capacity, and these\r\nnervous impulses are the immediate cause of transformations, giving\r\nto the organs new qualities, and rendering them more fit to make\r\nthe living creature thrive. That the nervous impulse produces, as a\r\nconsequence, an increase in the flow of blood, and a better nutrition\r\nfor the organ in play, is a positive biological fact. In my opinion,\r\nthen, adaptation is most frequently an act of the will, and not the\r\nresult of qualities accidentally acquired. It has as premise the clear\r\nperception and representation of the external causes of the feelings\r\nof discomfort, and a keen desire to escape from them, or, again, that\r\nof procuring feelings of pleasure, _i.e._, an inorganic appetite. Its\r\nmechanism consists in the elaboration of an intense representation of\r\nserviceable acts of certain organs, and in the sending of adequate\r\nimpulses to these organs. That such impulses can modify the anatomical\r\nstructure of the organs, Kant already anticipated when he wrote his\r\ntreatise, _Von der Macht des Gemüthes_; and modern therapeutics\r\nhas fully confirmed this, by showing that the stigmata of a Louise\r\nLateau, the healing of tumours on the tomb of the Deacon Paris, the\r\nmodifications induced by suggestion on the skin of hysterical subjects,\r\nthe formation of birth-marks by eventualities and emotions, are the\r\neffect of presentations on the bodily tissues. It was wrong to laugh at\r\nLamarck for teaching that the giraffe has a long neck because it has\r\ncontinually stretched it in order to be able to feed off the topmost\r\nfoliage of plants with tall stems. When the animal elaborates the clear\r\nidea that he ought to elongate his neck as much as possible in order\r\nto reach the elevated foliage, this presentation will influence in the\r\nstrongest manner the circulation of the blood in all the tissues of the\r\nneck; these will be quite differently nourished from what they would\r\nbe without this presentation, and the changes desired by the animal\r\nwill certainly take place little by little, if his general organization\r\nmakes them possible. Knowledge and will are therefore causes of\r\nadaptation--not the will in the mystical sense of Schopenhauer, but\r\nthe will that is the dispenser of nervous impulses. This summary must\r\nsuffice for the reader; this is not the place to develop it more, and\r\nto demonstrate in detail how fertile these ideas are for the theory of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\n[251] H. Taine, _Les Origines de la France contemporaine: La\r\nRévolution_, vol. ii., ‘La Conquête jacobine,’ Paris, 1881, pp. 11-12:\r\n‘Neither exaggerated self-esteem nor dogmatic argument is rare in the\r\nhuman species. In every country these two roots of the Jacobin spirit\r\nsubsist indestructible beneath the surface. Everywhere they are kept in\r\ncheck by established society, and everywhere they try to upheave the\r\nold historical structure which presses on them with all its weight....\r\nAt twenty years old, when a young man enters the world, his reason is\r\nhurt at the same time as his pride. In the first place, of whatever\r\nsociety he may be a member, it is a scandal to pure reason, for it\r\nhas not been constructed on a simple principle by a philosophical\r\nlegislator; it has been arranged by successive generations according\r\nto their multiple and varying needs.... In the second place,\r\nhowever perfect institutions, laws, and manners may be, since they\r\nhave preceded him he has not assented to them at all; others, his\r\npredecessors, have chosen for him, and have enclosed him, in advance,\r\nin a moral, political, and social mould which pleased them. It matters\r\nlittle if it displeases him; he is forced to submit to it, and, like a\r\nharnessed horse, he must walk between the shafts in the harness put on\r\nhim.... It is not surprising, then, if he is tempted to kick against\r\nthe framework in which, _nolens volens_, he is enclosed, and in which\r\nsubordination will be his lot. Thence it comes that the majority of\r\nyoung men--above all, those who have their careers to make--are more or\r\nless Jacobins on leaving college; it is _an infirmity of growth_.’\r\n\r\n[252] Dr. Paul Sollier, _Psychologie de l’Idiot et de l’Imbécile_, p.\r\n109 _et seq._: ‘There exists among idiots another instinct which is met\r\nwith, nevertheless, to a certain degree among normal children. This\r\nis destructiveness, which shows itself among all children as a first\r\nmanifestation of their powers of movement, under the form of a desire\r\nto strike, break, and destroy.... This tendency is much more pronounced\r\namong idiots.... It is not the same with imbeciles. Their malicious and\r\nmischievous spirit drives them to destroy, not only for the purpose of\r\nexpending their strength, but with the object of injuring.

He was for it not a word, not a symbol, not an\r\nabstraction, but a Being, in whose company the soul lived as we live\r\nwith a father who loves us.’\r\n\r\n[280] Théophile Gautier, who was himself a member of a hashish club,\r\ntries to make us believe (_Les Fleurs du Mal_, p. 57 _et seq._), that\r\nBaudelaire was addicted to the use of narcotic poisons only with the\r\nobject of ‘physiological experiment’; but we know the tendency of\r\nthe degenerate to represent the impulsions of which they are ashamed\r\nas acts of free will, for which they have all sorts of palliating\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\n[281] Dr. E. Régis, _Manuel pratique de Médecine mentale_. 2e édition.\r\nParis, 1892, p. 279.\r\n\r\n[282] _Les Fleurs du Mal_, p. 5--‘le culte de soi-même.’ This is\r\nThéophile Gautier’s own term.\r\n\r\n[283] Paul Bourget, _op. cit._, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[284] Ch. J. J. Sazaret, _Etude sur la Simulation de la Folie_. Nancy,\r\n1888. This pamphlet by a beginner, which contains a useful collection\r\nof clinical observations, is particularly amusing, in that all the\r\nobservations cited by the author demonstrate exactly the reverse of\r\nwhat he proposes to prove. After having himself asserted (p. 22)\r\nthat ‘the victims of hysteria are much given to simulate all sorts\r\nof maladies,’ he says (p. 29): ‘Persons mentally affected now and\r\nthen simulate madness; the case is rare, but it has nevertheless been\r\nverified, and if it has not been oftener recorded, it is, we believe,\r\nthat observers have limited themselves to a superficial examination,\r\nand certain actions have not been analyzed.’ The case is so far from\r\nrare that it is pointed out in every observation quoted by the author.\r\nIn the case of Baillarger (2nd observation), the so-called simulatrix\r\nhad been in a lunatic asylum eight years before, as a fully confirmed\r\nmadwoman; in the case of Morel (4th observation), the simulator ‘had a\r\nnervous attack at the sight of a lancet,’ which is clearly aichmophobia\r\nand a certain stigma of degeneration; in the 6th observation Morel\r\nadmits that ‘the extravagance of the subject, his fear of poison’\r\n(thus a case of pronounced iophobia), ‘and the fact of picking up\r\nfilth, indicate a possible mental disorder’; the case of Foville (10th\r\nobservation) ‘had a certain number of insane in his family’; the case\r\nof Legrand du Saulle (18th observation) was ‘the son of a hysterical\r\nwoman and grandson of a madman’; the case of Bonnet and Delacroix\r\n(19th observation) ‘numbers some insane among his ancestors’; the\r\ncase of Billod (22nd observation) ‘has often manifested disturbance\r\nand delirium,’ etc. All these supposed simulators were insane quite\r\nunmistakably, and the fact that they intentionally exaggerated the\r\nsymptoms of their delirium was only a further proof of their alienation.\r\n\r\n[285] Fr.

This atrophied creature has retained so few marks\r\nof an independent animal that it was looked upon for a long time as a\r\ndiseased excrescence of its host’s intestines.\r\n\r\n[294] Maurice Barrès, _Trois Stations de Psycho-thérapie_.

H. v. Kirchmann_); Berlin,\r\n1869, p. 65: ‘All interest spoils the judgment in matters of taste,\r\nand deprives it of its impartiality, especially if it does not, as\r\nrational interest does, make the feeling of utility paramount to that\r\nof pleasure, but bases it upon the latter, which always happens in\r\nan æsthetic judgment in so far as a thing causes pleasure or pain.’\r\nModern psycho-physiology has recognised this notion of Kant’s as\r\nerroneous, and has demonstrated that ‘the feeling of pleasure’ in\r\nitself is originally a feeling of organic ‘utility,’ and that ‘judgment\r\nin matters of taste’ does not exist at all without ‘interest.’\r\nPsycho-physiology makes use of the terms ‘organic tendency’ or\r\n‘proclivity,’ instead of ‘interest.’ Moreover Wilde, who does not mind\r\ncontradicting his own loose assertions, says (p. 186): ‘A critic cannot\r\nbe fair in the ordinary sense of the word. It is only about things that\r\ndo not interest one that one can give a really unbiased opinion, which\r\nis no doubt the reason why an unbiased opinion is always absolutely\r\nvalueless. The man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees\r\nabsolutely nothing at all.’ Hence Hecuba must be something to the\r\ncritic, that he may be able to criticise at all.\r\n\r\n[306] See in my _Paradoxe_ the chapters ‘Inhalt der poetischen\r\nLiteratur’ and ‘Zur Naturgeschichte der Liebe.’\r\n\r\n[307] S.

Freund, in\r\nhis _Blicken ins Culturleben_; Breslau, 1879, p. 9: ‘Idealization\r\nconsists ... in the removal of accidental accessories disturbing the\r\ntrue expression of the essential;’ p. 11: ‘All [eminent artists]\r\nraise that which they see to a purified image, purged of all that is\r\nunessential, accidental, disturbing; from that image springs up in\r\nall of them the idea lying at the base of the vision;’ p. 13: ‘He\r\n[the artist] comprehends the essential ... from which the accidental\r\ndisturbing accessories of the external phenomenon fall off like\r\nwithered leaves, so that to his inner eye the truth appears as a living\r\nidea,’ etc.\r\n\r\n[316] See foot-note to p. 38.\r\n\r\n[317] Wilhelm Loewenthal makes the feeling and need of religion spring\r\nfrom the same presentient emotion. For the author of _Grundzüge einer\r\nHygiene des Unterrichts_, religion is the form assumed in man’s\r\nconsciousness by the ideal, _i.e._, the presentient knowledge of the\r\naim of evolution. ‘The instinct of development--the indispensable\r\nbase of all life and all knowledge--is identical with the religious\r\nneed.’ Thus he writes in a memoir, unfortunately only ‘printed as a\r\nmanuscript,’ but most worthy of being made accessible to all the world.\r\n\r\n[318] NORA (_the children talk all at once to her during the\r\nfollowing_).

I do not look upon this designation\r\nas a happy one. Krafft-Ebing himself shows that Zola and, long before\r\nhim, Rousseau (he might have added Balzac in Baron Hulot in _Parents\r\npauvres_, part i.: _La cousine Bette_) have embodied this condition\r\nquite as clearly as Sacher-Masoch.

There is none of all this in Nietzsche. No\r\nsingle work of his forms a finished whole, or is wholly intelligible\r\nwithout the others. Each book, moreover, is totally wanting in organic\r\nstructure. Nietzsche writes almost exclusively in aphorisms, which,\r\nfilling sometimes two lines, sometimes several pages, are complete\r\nin themselves, and seldom manifest any direct connection with each\r\nother.... With proud indifference to the reader, the author has\r\navoided cutting even _one_ gap in the hedge with which he has closely\r\nsurrounded his intellectual creations. Access to him must be gained\r\nby fighting,’ etc. In spite of its seeming obscurity, Nietzsche has\r\nhimself given such pointed information concerning his method of work\r\nas amounts to an avowal. ‘All writing makes me angry or ashamed; for\r\nme, writing is a necessity.’ ‘But why, then, do you write?’ ‘Yes, my\r\ndear friend, let me say it in confidence: I have hitherto found no\r\nother means of _ridding_ myself of my thoughts.’ (The italics are\r\nNietzsche’s.) ‘And why do you wish to rid yourself of them?’ ‘Why\r\nI wish?

See _Die conventionellen Lügen\r\nder Kulturmenschheit_, 14 Aufl., pp. 211, 212: ‘This expression [of\r\nProudhon’s, that property is theft] can be regarded as true only from\r\nthe sophistical standpoint that everything existing exists for itself,\r\nand from the fact of its existence derives its right to belong to\r\nitself. According to this view, forsooth, a man steals the blade of\r\ngrass he plucks, the air he breathes, the fish he catches; but, then,\r\nthe martin, too, is stealing when it swallows a fly, and the grub when\r\nit eats its way into the root of a tree; then Nature is altogether\r\npeopled by arch-thieves, and, in general, everything steals that\r\nlives, _i.e._, absorbs from without materials not belonging to it,\r\nand organically elaborates them, and a block of platinum, which does\r\nnot even pilfer from the air a little oxygen with which to oxidize\r\nitself, would be the sole example of honesty on our globe. No; property\r\nresulting from earning, that is, from the exchange of a determined\r\namount of labour for a corresponding amount of goods, is not theft.’\r\nIf, throughout this passage, ‘theft’ be substituted for the word\r\n‘exploitation,’ used by Nietzsche, his sophism is answered.\r\n\r\n[376] _The Sacred Books of the East._ Translated by various Oriental\r\nscholars, and edited by F.

What? Has all the world’s\r\nrepose embarked here?’ ‘What use has the inspired one for wine? What?\r\nGive the mole wings and proud imaginings?’ ‘In so far as he says Yes\r\nto this other world, what? must he not then say No to its counterpart,\r\nthis world?’ ‘Round about God all becomes--what? perhaps world?’ ‘A\r\npessimist ... who says Yes to morality ... to _læde-neminem_-morality;\r\nwhat? is that really--a pessimist?’ ‘Fear and pity: with these feelings\r\nhas man hitherto stood in the presence of woman. What? Is there now\r\nto be an end of this?’ I will content myself with these examples, but\r\nlet it be remarked once for all, that all the specimens I adduce here\r\nfor the purpose of examining Nietzsche’s mental state could easily be\r\nmultiplied a hundredfold, as the characteristic peculiarities recur in\r\nhim hundreds of times. On one occasion he plainly becomes conscious of\r\nthis living note of interrogation, always present in his mind as an\r\nobsession. In _Also sprach Zarathustra_, pt. iii., p. 55, he calls the\r\npassion for rule, ‘the flashing note of interrogation by the side of\r\npremature answers.’ In this connection, this expression has absolutely\r\nno sense; but it at once becomes intelligible when it is remembered\r\nthat the insane are in the habit of suddenly giving utterance to the\r\nideas springing up in their consciousness. Nietzsche plainly _saw_\r\nin his mind ‘the flashing note of interrogation,’ and suddenly, and\r\nwithout transition, spoke of it.\r\n\r\n[408] ‘A Greek life, to which he said, No.’ ‘A pessimist who not\r\nmerely says, No, wishes No [!] but who ... does No’ [!!]. ‘An inward\r\nsaying No to this or that thing.’ ‘Free for death, and free in death,\r\na holy No-sayer.’ Then as a complementary counterpart: ‘Pregnant with\r\nlightnings, who say, Yes! laugh Yes!’ ‘While all noble morality grows\r\nto itself out of a triumphant saying Yea.’ (He feels himself to be\r\nsomething) ‘at least saying Yea to life.’ ‘To be able to say Yea to\r\nyourself, that is ... a ripe fruit.’ (Disinterested wickedness is felt\r\nby primitive humanity to be something) ‘to which conscience valiantly\r\nsays Yea.’ We see what use Nietzsche makes of his saying ‘Nay’ and\r\n‘Yea.’ It stands in the place of nearly all verbs joining subject with\r\npredicate. The thought ‘I am thirsty’ would, by Nietzsche, be thus\r\nexpressed, ‘I say Yes to water.’ Instead of ‘I am sleepy,’ he would\r\nsay, ‘I say Nay to wakefulness,’ or, ‘I say Yes to bed,’ etc. This is\r\nthe way in which invalids in incomplete aphasia are in the habit of\r\nparaphrasing their thoughts.\r\n\r\n[409] Dr. Hermann Türck, _Fr.

I have shown you some examples of\r\nthis delirium pushed to the extreme bounds of insanity, without the\r\nintermixture of a single idea foreign to the domain of platonic\r\naffection.’\r\n\r\n[411] In one passage of _Zur Genealogie der Moral_, p. 132, Nietzsche\r\nspeaks of the ‘species of moral onanists and self-indulgers.’ He\r\ndoes not apply the expression to himself; but it was unquestionably\r\nsuggested by an obscure suspicion of his own state of mind.\r\n\r\n[412] Dr. R. von Krafft-Ebing, _Neue Forschungen_, u. s. w., p. 45\r\n_ff._: ‘The complete contrary of masochism is Sadism. While in the\r\nformer the subject desires to suffer sorrows, and to feel himself in\r\nsubjection to violence, in the latter his aim is to cause sorrows, and\r\nto exercise violence.... All the acts and situations carried out in the\r\nactive part played by Sadism constitute, for masochism, the object of\r\nlonging, to be attained passively. In both perversions these acts form\r\na progression from purely symbolic events to grievous misdeeds.... Both\r\nare to be considered as original psychopathies of mentally abnormal\r\nindividuals, afflicted in particular with psychic _Hyperæsthesia\r\nsexualis_, but also, as a rule, with other anomalies.... The pleasure\r\nof causing sorrow and the pleasure of experiencing sorrow appear only\r\nas two different sides of the same psychic event, the primary and\r\nessential principle in which is the consciousness of active and passive\r\nsubjection respectively.’ See Nietzsche, _Also sprach Zarathustra_, pt.\r\ni., p. 95: ‘Thou art going to women? Forget not the whip!’ _Jenseits\r\nvon Gut und Böse_, p. 186: ‘Woman unlearns the fear of man,’ and thus\r\n‘exposes her most womanly instincts.’\r\n\r\n[413] Krafft-Ebing, _Neue Forschungen_, u. s. w., p. 108. (A\r\nsexual-psychopath thus writes): ‘I take great interest in art and\r\nliterature. Among poets and authors, those attract me most who describe\r\nrefined feelings, peculiar passions, choice impressions: an artificial\r\n(or ultra-artificial) style pleases me. In music, again, the nervous,\r\nstimulating music of a Chopin, a Schumann, a Schubert[!], a Wagner,\r\netc., appeal to me most. In art, all that is not only original, but\r\nbizarre, attracts me.’ P. 128 (another patient): ‘I am passionately\r\nfond of music, and am an enthusiastic partisan of Richard Wagner, for\r\nwhom I have remarked a predilection in most of us [sufferers from\r\ncontrary-sexual-feeling]; I find that this music accords so very much\r\nwith our nature,’ etc.\r\n\r\n[414] See, in _Paradoxe_, the chapter on ‘Evolutionistische Æsthetik.’\r\n\r\n[415] Dr. Max Zerbst, _Nein und Ja!_ Leipzig, 1892, p. vii.: ‘It is\r\nnot impossible that this little book may fall into the hands of some\r\nwho are nearly connected with the invalid ... whom every indelicate\r\ntreatment of his affliction must wound most deeply.’ The very last\r\nperson having the right to complain of indelicate treatment, and\r\nto demand consideration, is surely a partisan of Nietzsche’s, who\r\nclaims for himself the ‘joy in wishing to cause woe,’ and ‘grand\r\nunscrupulousness’ as the ‘privilege of the over-man’! Zerbst calls\r\nhis book a reply to that by Dr. Hermann Türck; but it is nothing but\r\na childishly obstinate and insolent repetition of all Nietzsche’s\r\nassertions, the insanity of which has been proved by Dr. Türck. It\r\nis exceedingly droll that Zerbst, appealing to a feeble compilation\r\nby Ziehen, wishes to demonstrate to Türck that there are no such\r\nthings as psychoses of the will. Now, Türck has not said a single word\r\nabout a psychosis of the will in Nietzsche; but Nietzsche, indeed, in\r\n_Fröhliche Wissenschaft_, p. 270, does speak of ‘monstrous disease of\r\nthe will,’ and of a ‘will-disease.’ Zerbst’s objection, therefore,\r\napplies, not to Türck, but to his own master--Nietzsche.\r\n\r\n[416] Dr. Hugo Kaatz, _op. cit._, pt. i., p. 6.\r\n\r\n[417] Ola Hansson, _Das junge Skandinavien.

(The hero of\r\nthe story entitled _Die missbrauchten Liebesbriefe_ [the misused\r\nlove-letters] suddenly conceives the notion of becoming an author.)\r\n‘He laid aside the book of commercial notes, and drew forth a smaller\r\none provided with a little steel lock. Then he placed himself before\r\nthe first tree he came to, examined it attentively, and wrote: “A\r\nbeech-trunk. Pale gray, with still paler flecks and transverse stripes.\r\nTwo kinds of moss cover it, one almost blackish, and one of a sheeny,\r\nvelvety green. In addition, yellowish, reddish and white lichen, which\r\noften run one into another.... Might perhaps be serviceable in scenes\r\nwith brigands.” Next he paused before a stake driven into the earth,\r\non which some child had hung a dead slow-worm. He wrote: “Interesting\r\ndetail. A small staff driven into the ground. Body of a silver-gray\r\nsnake wound round it.... Is Mercury dead, and has he left his stick\r\nwith dead snakes sticking here? This last allusion serviceable,\r\nabove all, for commercial tales. N.B.--The staff or stake is old and\r\nweather-beaten; of the same colour as the snake; in places where the\r\nsun shines upon it it is covered with little silver-gray hairs.

The\r\nlaity have greatly admired his description of the assassin Lantier in\r\n_La Bête humaine_. The most competent judge in such matters, however,\r\nLombroso, says of this character, which has been inspired in M. Zola,\r\naccording to his own declaration, by _L’Uomo delinquente_: ‘M. Zola, in\r\nmy opinion, has never observed criminals in real life.... His criminal\r\ncharacters give me the impression of the wanness and inaccuracy of\r\ncertain photographs which reproduce portraits, not from Nature, but\r\nfrom pictures.’--_Le piu recenti scoperte ed applicazioni della\r\npsichiatria ed antropologia criminale.

Montpellier, 1889.\r\n\r\n[458] _Le Temps_, N^o du 13 Février, 1892: ‘Current literature ...\r\nis, at present, at an inconceivably low ebb in Germany. From one end\r\nof the year to the other it is becoming an impossibility to discover\r\na novel, a drama, or a page of criticism worthy of notice. The\r\n_Deutsche Rundschau_ itself recently admitted this in despair. It is\r\nnot only the talent and the style which are deficient--all is poor,\r\nweak and flat; one might imagine one’s self in France, in the time of\r\nBouilly.... Even the desire to rise above a certain level of ordinary\r\nwriting seems wanting. One ends by being thankful to any contemporary\r\nGerman author who is seen to be making ... the simplest effort not\r\nto write like a crossing-sweeper.’ Every German who observes all the\r\nliterary productions of his contemporaries will see that this is the\r\nopinion of a spiteful enemy. This opinion, nevertheless, is explained\r\nand justified by the fact that at the present day it is only the\r\n‘realists’ who make enough stir to be heard in certain places abroad,\r\nand that there the natives are delighted to be able to consider them as\r\nrepresenting all the German literature of the day.\r\n\r\n[459] Arno Holz--Johannes Schlaf, _Die Familie Selicke_, 3^e Auflage;\r\nBerlin, 1892, p. vi.: ‘In fact, nothing so provokes us to smile ... as\r\nwhen they, in their anxiety to find models, label us as plagiarists\r\nof the great foreign authors. Let them say it, then.... It will be\r\nacknowledged some day that there has never yet been in our literature\r\na movement less influenced from without, more strongly originated from\r\nwithin--in one word, more _national_--than this movement, even at the\r\nfurther development of which we look to-day, and which has had for its\r\nvisible point of departure our _Papa Hamlet_. _Die Familie Selicke_ is\r\nthe most thoroughly German piece of writing our literature possesses,’\r\netc. This passage may serve the reader as a model both of the style\r\nin which these lads write, and of the tone in which they speak of\r\nthemselves and their productions.\r\n\r\n[460] The complaint of want of money is a constant refrain among the\r\n‘Young Germans.’ Listen to Baron Detlev von Liliencron: ‘You had\r\nnothing to eat again to-day; as a set-off, every blackguard has had his\r\nfill.’ ‘The terror of infernal damnation is--A garden of roses under\r\nthe kisses of spring,--When I think of how heart and soul fret,--To be\r\nhourly bitten by the need of money.’ And Karl Bleibtreu: ‘Brass reigns,\r\ngold reigns,--Genius goes its way a-begging.’ ‘To call a ton of gold\r\none’s own,--Sublime end, unattainable to man!’ etc.\r\n\r\n[461] Heinz Tovote, _Im Liebesrausch_, Berliner Roman, 6^e Auflage.\r\nBerlin, 1893.\r\n\r\n[462] Hermann Bahr, _Die gute Schule; Seelenstände._ Berlin, 1890.\r\n\r\n[463] _Einsame Menschen_; Drama. 1891, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[464] Gerhart Hauptmann, _Vor Sonnenaufgang_; Soziales Drama, 6^e\r\nAuflage; Berlin, 1892, p. 14: ‘During the two years of my imprisonment,\r\nI wrote my first book on political economy.’ p. 42: ‘The Icarians ...\r\nshare equally all work and all desert.
