The book has therefore\r\nbeen written with a view to showing the drift of American thought as\r\nillustrated by major writers or groups and as revealed by a careful\r\nstudy of one or two cardinal works by each. In this sequence of thought\r\nthe growth of American self-consciousness and the changing ideals of\r\nAmerican patriotism have been kept in mind throughout. The attempt\r\nis made to induce _study_ of representative classics and _extensive\r\nreading_ of the American literature which illuminates the past of the\r\ncountry--chiefly, of course, in reminiscent fiction, drama, and poetry.\r\n\r\nAs an aid to the student, there are appended to each chapter (except\r\nthe last three) topics and problems for study, and book lists which\r\nsummarize the output of each man, indicate available editions, and\r\npoint to the critical material which may be used as a supplement, but\r\nnot as a substitute, for first-hand study. This critical material\r\nhas been selected with a view, also, to suggesting books which might\r\nreasonably be included in libraries of normal schools and colleges, as\r\nwell as in universities.\r\n\r\nAs further aids to the student, there have been included two\r\nmaps, three chronological charts, and, in an appendix, a brief\r\ncharacterization of the American periodicals which have been most\r\nsignificant in stimulating American authorship by providing a market\r\nfor fiction, poetry, and the essay.\r\n\r\nIn the writing of the book the author's chief obligation has naturally\r\nbeen to the many university classes who have stimulated its\r\npreparation, not only by their attention but by their free discussion.\r\nSpecial acknowledgment is gratefully made to Mr. William W. Ellsworth\r\nfor a careful reading of all the manuscript and to Miss Marie\r\nGulbransen for the initial work in formulating the appendix on the\r\nAmerican magazines.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment is due to the publishers of _The Nation_ and _The New\r\nRepublic_ for portions of the chapters on Crèvecoeur, the Poetry of\r\nthe Revolution, Emerson, Lowell, Whitman, Sill, and Miller, which\r\noriginally appeared in these weeklies.\r\n\r\n                                                       PERCY H.

It sprang\r\nin a way like Minerva, full-armed from the head of Jove,--Jove in\r\nthis case being England, and the armor being the heritage which the\r\naverage American colonist had secured in England before he crossed\r\nthe Atlantic. In contrast, Greek, Roman, French, German, English,\r\nand the other less familiar literatures can all be more or less\r\nsuccessfully traced back to primitive conditions. Their early life was\r\ninterwoven with the growth of the language and the progress of a rude\r\ncivilization, and their earliest products which have come down to us\r\nwere not results of authorship as we know it to-day. They were either\r\nfolk poetry, composed perhaps and certainly enjoyed by the people in\r\ngroups and accompanied by group singing and dancing,--like the psalms\r\nand the simpler ballads,--or they were the record of folk tradition,\r\nslowly and variously developed through generations and finally\r\ncollected into a continuous story like the Iliad, the Æneid, the \"Song\r\nof Roland,\" the \"Nibelungenlied,\" and \"Beowulf.\" They were composed by\r\nword of mouth and not reduced to writing for years or generations, and\r\nthey were not put into print until centuries after they were current in\r\nspeech or transcribed by monks and scholars.\r\n\r\nThe one great story-poem of this sort in American literature is the\r\n\"Song of Hiawatha,\" but this is the story of a conquered and vanishing\r\nrace; it has nothing basic to do with the Americans of to-day; it is\r\nfar less related to them than the earlier epics of the older European\r\nnations to whom we trace our ancestry. Except for a few place-names\r\neven the language of America owes nothing to that of the Indians,\r\nfor the English tongue is a compound of Greek and Latin and French\r\nand German. Our literary beginnings, then, go back to two groups of\r\neducated English colonists, or immigrants, and our knowledge of them\r\nto conditions in the divided England from which they first came to\r\nJamestown, Virginia, in 1607 and to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe English of the early seventeenth century were an eager, restless,\r\ndriving people. The splendid reign of Queen Elizabeth was just past.\r\nThe country was secure from foreign enemies and confident in its\r\nstrength. Great naval leaders had brought new honors to her name;\r\ngreat explorers had planted her flag on mysterious and new-discovered\r\ncoasts; a group of dramatists had made the theater as popular as the\r\nmoving-picture house of to-day; a great architect was adorning London\r\nwith his churches; poets and novelists, preachers and statesmen,\r\nscientists and scholars, were all working vividly and keenly. There\r\nwas an active enthusiasm for the day's doings, a kind of living assent\r\nto Hamlet's commentary, on \"this goodly frame, the earth, ... this\r\nmost excellent canopy, the air, ... this brave o'erhanging firmament,\r\nthis majestical roof fretted with golden fire\"; and to the exclamation\r\nthat follows: \"What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how\r\ninfinite in faculty! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in\r\naction, how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the beauty\r\nof the world! the paragon of animals!\" And under a strong and tactful\r\nmonarch the nation had been kept at peace with itself.\r\n\r\nYet in this fallow soil the seeds of controversy had been steadily\r\ntaking root; and when Elizabeth was followed on the throne by the vain\r\nand unregal James I, the crop turned out to be a harvest of dragons'\r\nteeth. Puritan democrats and cavalier Royalists fought with each other\r\nover the body of England till it was prostrate and helpless. What\r\nfollowed was the rise of Puritan power, culminating with the execution\r\nof Charles II and the establishment of the Commonwealth under the\r\nCromwells from 1649 to 1660, and the peaceful restoration of monarchy\r\nat the latter date. It was during the mid-stages of these developments\r\nthat the first settlements were made in English America. Both factions\r\nincluded large numbers of vigorous individuals of the pioneer type.\r\nThe Puritans were technically called \"dissenters\" and \"nonconformists\"\r\nbecause of their attitude toward the established Church of England; but\r\nthe Royalists who came over to America were simply nonconformists of\r\nanother type who preferred doing things out on the frontier to living\r\nconventional lives at home.\r\n\r\nThe Royalists, who settled in the South, came away, like other\r\ntravelers and explorers of their day, to settle new English territory\r\nas a landed aristocracy. They were a mixed lot, but on the whole they\r\nwere not an irreligious lot. They believed in the established church\r\nas they did in the established government, and they persecuted with a\r\ngood will those who tried to follow other forms of worship than their\r\nown. They were, however, chiefly fortune hunters, just as were the\r\nmen who surged out to California in 1849 or those who went to Alaska\r\nfifty years later; they hoped to make their money in the west and to\r\nspend it back in the east, and they had little thought of literature,\r\neither as a thing to enjoy or as a thing to create. When they wrote\r\nthey did so to give information about the country, the Indians, and the\r\nnew conditions of living, or to keep in touch with relatives, legal\r\nauthorities, or sources of money supply; and always they had in mind\r\nthe thought of attracting new settlers, for they needed labor more than\r\nanything else. They made no attempt at general education, adopting\r\nthe now-abandoned aristocratic theory that too much knowledge would\r\nbe a dangerous source of discontent among the working people. Some\r\nfew individuals wrote accounts and descriptions that are interesting\r\nto the modern reader, but these were not representative of the people\r\nas a whole. They were Englishmen away from home, living temporarily\r\nin _Virgin_-ia (the province of the virgin queen, Elizabeth), in\r\n_James_-town, in the _Carolinas_ (from the Latin for Charles), in\r\n_Mary_-land, and, even as late as 1722, in _George_-ia.\r\n\r\nThe nonconformists whom adverse winds drove to the North in 1620 were\r\na very different folk. They were predominantly Puritan in prejudice\r\nand in upbringing. Many of their leaders were graduates of Cambridge\r\nUniversity who had gone into the Church of England, only to be driven\r\nout of it because of their unorthodox preaching--born leaders who\r\nwere brave enough to risk comfort and safety for conscience' sake.\r\nThey came over to America in order, as Mrs. Hemans put it, to have\r\n\"freedom to worship God,\" but not to give this freedom to others.\r\nThey had endured so much for their religious faith that they wanted\r\na place where this, and this only, should be tolerated. So they\r\nbecame, not illogically, the fiercest kind of persecutors, practicing\r\nwith a vengeance the lessons in oppression that they had learned in\r\nEngland at the cost of blood and suffering. They settled in compact\r\ntowns where they could believe and worship together; they put up\r\n\"meetinghouses\" where they could listen to the preacher on the Lord's\r\nDay and where they could transact public business, with the same man\r\nas \"moderator,\" on week days. He was the controlling power--\"pastor,\"\r\nor shepherd, and \"dominie,\" or master, of the community. And when the\r\nmeetinghouses were finished, the settlers erected as their next public\r\nbuildings the schoolhouses, where the children might learn to read the\r\nScriptures so that they could \"foil the ould deluder, Satan.\" Education\r\nbecame compulsory as well as public. The Puritans' place-names were\r\nIndian--Massachusetts and Agawam; derived from England of Puritan\r\nassociations, like Boston, Plymouth, and Falmouth; or quaintly\r\nScriptural, like Marthas Vineyard, Providence, and Salem. These people,\r\nunlike the settlers in the South, came over to live and die here. They\r\nwrote for the same social and business reasons that the Virginians did,\r\nbut they also wrote much about their religion, compiled the \"Bay Psalm\r\nBook,\" published sermons, and recorded their struggles, which began\r\nvery early and were doomed to final failure, to keep their New England\r\nfree from \"divers religions.\" At first their writings were sent to\r\nEngland for publication, but before long, in 1638, they had their own\r\nprinting press, and the things that were printed on it were not so much\r\nthe sayings of individual men as the opinions of the community.\r\n\r\nThe history of the migrations to the North and to the South during\r\nthe seventeenth century is one with the history of the civil struggle\r\nin England. Up to 1640 colonization was slow and consistent at both\r\npoints. From 1640 to 1660 it increased rapidly in the South and\r\ndeclined in the North, for in those years the grip of the Puritans\r\non the old country relieved them from persecution there and from the\r\nconsequent need to avoid it and, at the same time, made many Royalists\r\nglad of a chance to escape to some more peaceful spot. From 1660\r\non, with the return of the Royalists to power in England, Puritan\r\nmigration was once more started to the North, and the home country was\r\nagain secure for the followers of the king. But the real characters\r\nof the two districts were unchanged. They were firmly established in\r\nthe earliest years, and they have persisted during the intervening\r\ncenturies clear up to the present time. The America of to-day is a\r\ncompound whose basic native qualities are inherited from the oldest\r\ntraditions of aristocratic Virginia and the oldest traits of democratic\r\nand Puritan Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the early periods of any literature the exercise\r\nof artistic judgment is always very charitable. Rough, uncouth,\r\nfragmentary pieces are taken into account because they serve as\r\na bridge to the remoter past. Harsh critics of colonial American\r\nliterature seem to forget this practice when they rule out of court\r\neverything produced in this country before the days of Irving and\r\nCooper. A great deal of the earlier writing should, of course, be\r\nconsidered only as source material for the historian; but some of it\r\nhas the same claim to attention as the old chronicles, plays, and\r\nballads in English literary history. It deserves study if it portrays\r\nor criticizes or even unconsciously reflects the life and thought of\r\nthe times, and it is significant as an American product if in form\r\nor content or point of view it clearly belongs to this side of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThe nature of settlement and the neglect of popular education led to an\r\nearly lapse in authorship in the Southern colonies, so that in a survey\r\nas brief as this chapter their writers do not come into view until they\r\nfind expression in the oratory and statesmanship of the Revolutionary\r\nperiod. Their narratives and descriptions of colonial life, as long as\r\nthey wrote them at all, were quite like most of the earliest Northern\r\nwritings of the sort. The one outstanding difference is that in\r\nwhatever they wrote, the religious motive for settlement and the belief\r\nin a personal Providence were less insistently recorded than by the\r\nPuritans. Thus where John Smith was content with the general phrase \"it\r\npleased God,\" Anthony Thacher, saved from shipwreck in Boston Harbor,\r\nwrote devoutly, \"the Lord directed my toes into a crevice in the rock\";\r\nand where Smith's companions hoped for the benevolent favor of the\r\nMost High, Thacher's fellow-worshipers were perfectly certain that\r\nevery step they took was ordained by God, so that even their apparent\r\nmisfortunes were His punishments for misconduct.\r\n\r\nIn all the great mass of Puritan writing in the first century of\r\nresidence in America one definite current appears, and that is the\r\nquiet but irresistible current of change in human thought. The Puritans\r\nhad made the profound but constantly repeated mistake of assuming\r\nthat after thousands of years of groping by mankind, they had at last\r\ndiscovered the \"ultimate truth\"; that for the rest of time men need do\r\nnothing but follow the precepts which God had revealed to them about\r\nlife here and life hereafter. They were, in their own serious way,\r\nhappy in their confident possession of truth and sternly resolved to\r\nbestow it or, if necessary, impose it on all whom they could control.\r\nTheir failure was recorded with their earliest attempts, and it came,\r\nnot because of their particular weakness or the strength of their\r\nparticular adversaries, but because they were trying to obstruct the\r\nprogress of human thought, which is as inexorable as any other force\r\nof nature. They might as well have entered into an argument with\r\ngravitation or the tides. The most interesting and the best-written\r\npieces of seventeenth-century New England literature all give evidence\r\nof this rearguard action against the advancing forces of truth.\r\n\r\nThe Puritanism against which this rising tide of dissent developed was\r\nadmirably embodied in William Bradford (1590-1657), the _Mayflower_\r\nPilgrim who was more than thirty times governor of his colony and the\r\nauthor of \"A History of Plimouth Plantation.\" He was a brave, sober,\r\ndevout leader with an abiding sense of the holy cause in which he was\r\nenlisted. His journal of the first year in America and his history\r\nare clearly and sometimes finely written, and give ample proof of his\r\nstalwart character--\"fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,\" and free\r\nfrom the personal narrowness which is often mistakenly ascribed to all\r\nPuritans. In his account, for example, of the reasons for the Pilgrims'\r\nremoval from Leyden the chronicle tells of the hardships under which\r\nthey had lived there, the encroachments of old age, the disturbing\r\neffects of the life on the children, and, lastly, the great hope they\r\nentertained of advancing the church of Christ in some remote part\r\nof the world. It recounts many of the objections advanced against\r\nattempting settlement in America, and concludes:\r\n\r\n  It was answered, that all great and honorable actions are accompanied\r\n  with great difficulties, and must be both enterprised and overcome\r\n  with answerable courages. It was granted the dangers were great, but\r\n  not desperate; the difficulties were many, but not invincible. For\r\n  though there were many of them likely, yet they were not certain; it\r\n  might be sundry of the things feared might never befall; others, by\r\n  provident care and the use of good means, might in a great measure\r\n  be prevented; and all of them, through the help of God, by fortitude\r\n  and patience, might either be borne or overcome. True it was, that\r\n  such attempts were not to be made and undertaken without good ground\r\n  and reason; not rashly or lightly, as many have done for curiosity\r\n  or hope of gain, etc. But their condition was not ordinary; their\r\n  ends were good and honorable; their calling lawful and urgent; and\r\n  therefore they might expect the blessing of God in their proceeding.\r\n  Yea, though they should lose their lives in this action, yet might\r\n  they have comfort in the same, and their endeavors would be honorable.\r\n\r\nUnhappily this heroic trait of Puritanism was coupled with a desperate\r\nreligious bigotry which the world is even yet slow to forgive.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest local dissenters was Thomas Morton (1575?-1646),\r\nauthor of the \"New English Canaan,\" published in London, 1637. It is a\r\nhalf-pathetic fact that this should stand out to-day beyond anything\r\nelse written in the same decade in America, for the best of it--the\r\nthird book--is a savage satire on the Puritans in Massachusetts.\r\nMorton, it is needless to say, was not a Puritan himself. He was a\r\nrestless, dishonest, unscrupulous gentleman-adventurer from London\r\nwho gave the best part of his life to fighting the Puritans on their\r\nown grounds. He started a fur-trading post at \"Merry Mount,\" just\r\nsoutheast of Boston, sold the Indians liquor and firearms, consorted\r\nwith their women, and in wanton mockery set up a Maypole there and\r\ntaught the Indians the English games and dances which were particularly\r\noffensive to the grave residents of Plymouth and Boston. If he had\r\nnot written his book, he would be remembered now only as one of the\r\nchief trouble-makers whom the Puritans had to fight down; but he did\r\nthem more damage with his pen than with all his active misbehavior.\r\nHe undermined their influence by not treating them soberly. He made\r\nfun of their costume, derided their speech, ridiculed their religious\r\nformalities, and held the valiant Miles Standish up to scorn by\r\nnicknaming him Captain Shrimp. He went further, and questioned their\r\nmotives and their honesty, their integrity in business, and their\r\nsincerity in religion. A great deal of what he wrote about them was\r\nlibelously unfair; he should never be taken as an authority for facts\r\nunless supported by other writers of his day. But underneath all his\r\nclever abuse of them and their ways, there is an evident basis of truth\r\nwhich is confirmed by the sober study of history. Although the Puritans\r\nwere brave, strong, self-denying servants of the stern God whom they\r\nworshiped, they were sometimes sanctimonious, sometimes cruelly\r\nvengeful, and all too often so eager to achieve His ends on earth that\r\nthey were regardless of the means they took. At the very beginning of\r\ntheir life in America, Thomas Morton held these characteristics up to\r\npublic scorn; and in so doing he made his book an omen of the long,\r\nlosing battle they were destined to fight. Morton's effectiveness as\r\na writer lies in the fact that however ill-behaved he may have been,\r\nhe was attractively--maybe dangerously--genial in character. He was in\r\ntruth \"a cheerful liar\"; but he lied like the writer of fiction who\r\ndisregards the exact facts because he is telling a good story as well\r\nas he can and because that good story is based on real life. The next\r\nNew Englander to give proof that the Puritans were not having an easy\r\ntime in their \"new English Canaan\" was Nathaniel Ward (1578-1652?),\r\nauthor of \"The Simple Cobler of Aggawam.\" In character and convictions\r\nhe was as different from Morton as a man could be. When he wrote this\r\nbook, which was published in London in 1647, he was an irascible old\r\nPuritan who had suffered much for his faith, and was still fighting\r\nfor it, although very near to his threescore years and ten. He had been\r\ngraduated at Cambridge, gone into the Church of England, been hounded\r\nthere for his liberalism, come to America, and served a pastorate\r\nat Agawam (now Ipswich), Massachusetts. He had withdrawn on account\r\nof ill health, but later had served the state so well that he was\r\ngranted six hundred acres as a reward, and had lived on there until his\r\nreturn to England at the age of seventy. He believed fiercely in the\r\nrighteousness of the Puritan doctrines and in the wickedness of any\r\ndeparture from them; and his book was a valiant protest against any\r\nrelaxation on the part of the faithful. It was written with reference\r\nto conditions in England, but it was composed after fifteen years'\r\nresidence in America, and showed his unrest at conditions in the new\r\ncountry as well as in the old.\r\n\r\nThe book is a strange compound. In thought it is a piece of\r\ndyed-in-the-wool old fogyism, but in form and literary style it is\r\nvigorous, jaunty, and amusing. The full title is \"The Simple Cobler of\r\nAggawam in America; willing to help Mend his Native Country, lamentably\r\ntattered, both in the upper-Leather and sole, with all the honest\r\nstitches he can take. And as willing never to be paid for his work by\r\nOld English wonted pay. It is his Trade to patch all the year long,\r\ngratis. Therefore I Pray Gentlemen keep your Purses.\" He feared all\r\ninnovations, but most of all the doctrine that men should enjoy liberty\r\nof conscience. \"Let all the wits under the Heavens lay their heads\r\ntogether and find an Assertion worse than this [and] I will Petition\r\nto be chosen the universal Ideot of the World.\" \"Since I knew what\r\nto fear, my timorous heart hath dreaded three things: a blazing Star\r\nappearing in the Air; a State Comet, I mean a favourite, rising in a\r\nkingdom; a new Opinion spreading in Religion.\" The second section of\r\nthe book is devoted to fashions of dress, an evergreen subject for the\r\nsatirist. Ward's attitude toward woman as an inferior creature was\r\nalmost as primitive as that of the cave man, and apparently he would\r\nhave liked it better if the \"bullymong drossock\" had dressed with\r\nthe simplicity of a cave woman. As it was he felt that the lady of\r\nfashion was \"the very gizzard of a trifle, the product of the quarter\r\nof a cypher, the epitome of Nothing\"; and he had equal contempt for\r\ntailors who \"spend their lives in making fidle-cases for futulous\r\nWomen's phansies; which are the very pettitoes of Infirmity, the\r\ngiblets of perquisquilian toyes.\" The remainder of the work is given\r\nto a discussion of affairs of English state, written with the same\r\naggressive positiveness. The most interesting bit of it is the portion\r\nwhich proclaims his belief in savage oppression of the Irish, summing\r\nup the essence of the wrong-headed stupidity which has made the history\r\nof Ireland so lamentable a story even to the present time. What the\r\nold gentleman wrote is striking at points, because it seems so timely.\r\nBut Ward was never up to date, in the sense of being prophetic. When\r\nhe said things that apply to the twentieth century, they apply either\r\nbecause, like the question of extravagance in dress, the topic is a\r\npersistent trait in human nature or because, like the Irish problem,\r\nmatters which should long ago have been settled have been allowed for\r\ncenturies to confuse and complicate life. Yet Ward wrote with odd and\r\nstriking effectiveness; and his book is far more than the \"curiosity\"\r\nwhich many critics have agreed to call it, for it is one of the best\r\nsurviving records of the Puritan attempt to maintain a strangle hold on\r\nhuman thought.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the righteousness of persecuting dissenters was the\r\nparticular ground for attack by a younger and equally vigorous man,\r\nRoger Williams (1604-1683). Williams, before he was forty years\r\nold, had been thrown out of two church establishments--first in\r\nProtestant England and then in Puritan Massachusetts. He represented\r\nwhat Macaulay termed the very \"dissidence of dissent.\" And now, in a\r\nlong and laborious argument lasting from 1644 to 1652, he fought out\r\nthe issue with the Reverend John Cotton. Only by the most generous\r\ninterpretation can the lengthening chain of this printed controversy\r\nbe considered as literature, yet it has the same right to inclusion as\r\nthe English disquisitions of Wyclif, Jeremy Taylor, and John Wesley.\r\nAn English prisoner in Newgate, assailing persecution for cause of\r\nconscience, had been answered by John Cotton. Then followed Williams's\r\n\"The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for cause of Conscience, discussed\r\nin a Conference between Truth and Peace\" (1644); Cotton's reply \"The\r\nBloody Tenent washed and made white in the Blood of the Lamb\" (1647);\r\nand Williams's rejoinder, \"The Bloody Tenent yet More Bloody: by Mr.\r\nCottons endeavor to wash it white in the Blood of the Lambe\" (1652).\r\nThe whole process of argument by both the reverend gentlemen was to\r\nset their literal English minds to work at analyzing and expounding\r\nBiblical passages which were full of oriental richness of imagery.\r\nIt was, all things considered, rather less reasonable than it would\r\nbe for the chancellors of the British and German empires to base an\r\nargument about the freedom of the seas upon definite citations from the\r\n\"Rubaiyat\" of Omar Khayyam.\r\n\r\nThe chief grounds of offense in the sinful unorthodoxy of Roger\r\nWilliams were that he asserted two things which have become axioms\r\nto-day, and two more which will be admitted by every thoughtful and\r\nhonest person. The first two were that religion should not be professed\r\nby those who did not believe it in their hearts, and that the power of\r\nthe magistrates extended only to the bodies and the property of the\r\nsubjects and not to their religious convictions. The second two were\r\nthat America belonged to the Indians and not to the king of England,\r\nand that the established church was necessarily corrupt. By this last\r\nhe meant simply that any human organization that is given complete\r\nauthority, and need not fear either competition or overthrow by public\r\nopinion, is certain to decay from within. It was the idea beneath\r\nTennyson's lines\r\n\r\n      The old order changeth, yielding place to new,\r\n      And God fulfils himself in many ways,\r\n      Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.\r\n\r\nYet these opinions, preached and practiced by Williams, resulted in\r\nhis being expelled from the community. The attempt was made to send\r\nhim back to England, but he managed to get a permanent foothold in\r\nRhode Island, where he opposed the still more liberal Quakers almost as\r\nviolently as the churchmen of old and new England had opposed him. To\r\nhis credit be it said, however, that he did not invoke the law against\r\nthem. In action as well as in belief he marked the progress of liberal\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  EGGLESTON, EDWARD.

They wrote memorial verses of the most intricate and ingenious\r\nsorts, sometimes carving them in stone as epitaphs. There is less verse\r\nsprinkled through the unregenerate Morton's \"Canaan\" than there is in\r\nthe intolerant Ward's \"Cobler.\" The old conservative never wrote more\r\nwisely than in this so-called \"song\":\r\n\r\n      They seldom lose the field, but often win,\r\n      Who end their Warres, before their Warres begin.\r\n\r\n      Their Cause is oft the worse, that first begin,\r\n      And they may lose the field, the field that win.\r\n\r\n      In Civil Warres 'twixt Subjects and their King,\r\n      There is no conquest got, by conquering.\r\n\r\n      Warre ill begun, the onely way to mend,\r\n      Is t'end the Warre before the Warre do end.\r\n\r\n      They that will end ill Warres, must have the skill,\r\n      To make an end by Rule, and not by Will.\r\n\r\n      In ending Warres 'tween Subjects and their Kings,\r\n      Great things are sav'd by losing little things.\r\n\r\nThe first whole volume in English printed in the Western Hemisphere\r\n(printing of Spanish books in Mexico had long preceded) was \"The Bay\r\nPsalm Book,\" Cambridge, 1640. This represented a conscientious attempt\r\nto put into the service of worship a literal translation of the Psalms.\r\nThe worst passages are all too frequently cited as evidence of the\r\ninability of the Puritans to compose or appreciate good verse. And this\r\nin spite of the often-quoted and charmingly written prose comment in\r\nthe editors' preface:\r\n\r\n  If therefore the verses are not alwayes so smooth and elegant as\r\n  some may desire or expect; let them consider that God's Altar needs\r\n  not our pollishings: Ex. 20. for wee have respected rather a plaine\r\n  translation, then to smooth our verses with the sweetness of any\r\n  paraphrase, and soe have attended Conscience rather than Elegance,\r\n  fidelity rather then poetry, in translating the hebrew words into\r\n  english language, and David's poetry into english meetre; that soe\r\n  wee may sing in Sion the Lords songs of prayse according to his owne\r\n  will; untill hee take us from hence and wipe away all our teares, &\r\n  bid us enter into our masters joye to sing eternall Halleluliahs.\r\n\r\nSome historians, moreover, seem to derive satisfaction from quoting\r\npassages from Michael Wigglesworth's (1631-1705) \"Day of Doom\" as\r\nadded proof that the Puritans were never able to write verse that was\r\nbeautiful or even graceful. It must be admitted that this grave and\r\npretentious piece of work was hardly more lovely than the name of the\r\nauthor. Wigglesworth was a devoted Puritan who came to America at the\r\nage of seven; graduated from Harvard College; qualified to practice\r\nmedicine; and then became a preacher, serving, with intermissions of\r\nill health, as pastor in Malden, Massachusetts, from 1657 until his\r\ndeath in 1705. He was a gentle, kindly minister, unfailing in his care\r\nfor both the bodies and the souls of his parishioners.\r\n\r\nHe had the \"lurking propensity\" for verse-writing which was common\r\namong the men of his time, but instead of venting it merely in the\r\ncomposing of acrostics, anagrams, and epitaphs, he dedicated it to the\r\nLord in the writing of a sort of rimed sermon on the subject of the Day\r\nof Judgment. The full title reads, \"The Day of Doom or, a Description\r\nOf the Great and Last Judgment with a short discourse about Eternity.\r\nEccles. 12. 14. For God shall bring every work into judgment with\r\nevery secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\" It\r\nwas printed, probably in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1662. The poem\r\nis composed of two hundred and twenty-four eight-line stanzas. After\r\nan invocation and the announcement of the day of doom, the dead come\r\nfrom their graves before the throne of Christ. There the \"sheep\" who\r\nhave been chosen for salvation are placed on the right, and the wicked\r\n\"goats\" come in groups to hear the judge's verdict. These include\r\nhypocrites, civil, honest men, those who died in youth before they were\r\nconverted, those who were misled by the example of the good, those who\r\ndid not understand the Bible, those who feared martyrdom more than\r\nhell-torment, those who thought salvation was hopeless, and, finally,\r\nthose who died as babes. All are sternly answered from the throne, and\r\nall are swept off to a common eternal doom except the infants, for whom\r\nis reserved \"the easiest room in hell.\"\r\n\r\nTwo facts should be remembered in criticizing \"The Day of Doom\" as\r\npoetry. The first is that Wigglesworth wrote it consciously as a\r\nteacher and preacher and not as a poet. In his introduction he said:\r\n\r\n          Reader, I am a fool\r\n          And have adventurèd\r\n          To play the fool this once for Christ,\r\n          The more his fame to spread.\r\n          If this my foolishness\r\n          Help thee to be more wise,\r\n          I have attainèd what I seek,\r\n          And what I only prize.\r\n\r\nThe second point is that in writing a rimed sermon for Christian\r\nworshipers he had a model supplied him in the popular \"Bay Psalm Book,\"\r\nwhich had appeared some twenty years before and which was familiar to\r\nall the people who were likely to be his readers. The translators of\r\nthe 121st Psalm wrote, for example:\r\n\r\n          1  I to the hills lift up mine eyes,\r\n               from whence shall come mine aid\r\n          2  Mine help doth from Jehovah come,\r\n               which heav'n and earth hath made.\r\n\r\nAnd Wigglesworth took up the strain with\r\n\r\n          No heart so bold, but now grows cold,\r\n            and almost dead with fear;\r\n          No eye so dry but now can cry,\r\n            and pour out many a tear.\r\n\r\nTo any modern reader the use of this light-footed meter for so grave\r\na subject seems utterly ill-considered, and the whole idea of the day\r\nof doom as he presented it seems so unnatural as to be amusing. But\r\nWigglesworth was trying to write a rimed summary of what everybody\r\nthought, in a meter with which everybody was familiar, and he was\r\nunqualifiedly successful. A final verdict on Michael Wigglesworth is\r\noften superciliously pronounced on the basis of this one poem, or,\r\nif any further attention is conceded him, the worst of his remaining\r\noutput is produced for evidence that he and all Puritan preachers were\r\nclumsy and prosaic verse-writers.\r\n\r\nYet in the never-quoted lines immediately following \"The Day of\r\nDoom\"--a poem without a title, on the vanity of human wishes--Michael\r\nWigglesworth gave proofs of human kindliness and of poetic power. In\r\nthese earnest lines Wigglesworth showed a mastery of fluent verse, a\r\ncontrol of poetic imagery, and a gentle yearning for the souls' welfare\r\nof his parishioners which is the utterance of the pastor rather than\r\nof the theologian. For a moment God ceases to be angry, Christ stands\r\npleading without the gate, and the good pastor utters a poem upon the\r\nneglected theme \"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you\":\r\n\r\n      Fear your great Maker with a child-like awe,\r\n      Believe his Grace, love and obey his Law.\r\n      This is the total work of man, and this\r\n      Will crown you here with Peace and there with Bliss.\r\n\r\n\"The Day of Doom,\" however, was far more popular than the better poetry\r\nthat Wigglesworth wrote at other times. It was the most popular book\r\nof the century in America. People memorized its easy, jingling meter\r\njust as they might have memorized ballads or, at a later day, Mother\r\nGoose rimes; and the grim description became \"the solace,\" as Lowell\r\nsays, \"of every fireside, the flicker of the pine-knots by which\r\nit was conned perhaps adding a livelier relish to its premonitions\r\nof eternal combustion.\" The popularity of \"The Day of Doom\" shows\r\nthat in the very years when the Royalists were returning to power in\r\nEngland the Puritans were greatly in the majority in New England. The\r\nreaction marked by Morton, Ward, and Roger Williams was only beginning.\r\nMoreover, if it had been the only \"poetry\" of the period, we should\r\nhave to admit that the Puritans were almost hopelessly unpoetical.\r\n\r\nAnne Bradstreet (1612-1672) proves the contrary, and in doing so she\r\nproves how the love of beauty can manage to bloom under the bleakest\r\nskies. Her talent was assuredly a \"flower in a crannied wall.\" She\r\nwas born in England in 1612 and was married at the age of sixteen, as\r\ngirls often were in those days, to a man several years older, Simon\r\nBradstreet. In 1630 she came to Massachusetts with her husband and\r\nher father. Both became eminent in the affairs of the colony. In the\r\nfamily they were doubtless sober and probably dull. Mrs. Bradstreet\r\nkept house under pioneer conditions in one place after another, and\r\nwhen still less than forty years old had become the mother of eight\r\nchildren. Yet somewhere in the rare moments of her crowded days--and\r\none can imagine how far apart those moments must have been--she put\r\ninto verse \"a compleat Discourse and Description of The Four Elements,\r\nConstitutions, Ages of Man, Seasons of the Year; Together with an exact\r\nEpitome of the four Monarchies, viz., the Assyrian, Persian, Grecian,\r\nRoman\" [this means _five_ long poems, and not two]; \"also a dialogue\r\nbetween Old England and New concerning the late troubles; with divers\r\nother pleasant and serious poems.\" All these she wrote without apparent\r\nthought of publication, for the purely artistic reason that she enjoyed\r\ndoing so; and in 1650--halfway between \"The Bay Psalm Book\" and \"The\r\nDay of Doom\"--they were taken over to London by a friend, and there put\r\ninto print as the work of \"The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America.\"\r\n\r\nPoetry was more than a diversion for Anne Bradstreet; it must have been\r\na passion. As a girl she had been allowed to read in the library of\r\nthe Puritan Earl of Lincoln, over whose estate her father was steward.\r\nAnd here she had fallen under the spell of the lesser poets of her\r\nage, naturally not the dramatists, whom the Puritans opposed. So,\r\nafter their fashion, and particularly in the fashion of a Frenchman,\r\nDu Bartas, whose works were popular in an English translation, she\r\nwrote her quaint \"quarternions,\" or poems on the four elements, the\r\nfour seasons, the four ages, and the four \"humours,\" and capped them\r\nall with the four monarchies. These are interesting to the modern\r\nreader only as examples of how the human mind used to work. Chaucer\r\nhad juggled with the same materials; Ben Jonson had been fascinated\r\nwith them. It was a literary tradition to develop them one by one, to\r\nset them in debate against each other, and to interweave them into\r\ncorresponding groups: childhood, water, winter, phlegm; youth, air,\r\nspring, blood; manhood, fire, summer, choler; and old age, earth,\r\nautumn, melancholy.\r\n\r\nYet her chief claim on our interest is founded on the shorter poems,\r\nin which she took least pride. In these she showed her real command\r\nof word and measure to express poetic thought. Her \"Contemplations,\"\r\nfor example, is as poetic in thought as Bryant's \"Thanatopsis,\" or\r\nas Lanier's \"The Marshes of Glynn,\" to which it stands in suggestive\r\ncontrast (see pp. 161 and 357). The former two are on the idea that\r\nnature endures but man passes away. This was never long absent from the\r\nPuritan mind, but when it came to the ordinary Puritan it was likely to\r\nbe cast into homely and prosaic verse, as in the epitaph:\r\n\r\n      The path of death it must be trod\r\n      By them that wish to walk with God.\r\n\r\nAnne Bradstreet, taking the same observation, wrote with noble dignity:\r\n\r\n      O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things,\r\n      That draws oblivions curtain over kings,\r\n      Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not,\r\n      Their names without a Record are forgot,\r\n      Their parts, their ports, their pomp's all laid in th' dust\r\n      Nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings, scape time's rust;\r\n      But he whose name is grav'd in the white stone[1]\r\n      Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.\r\n\r\n  [1] Rev. ii, 17.\r\n\r\nYet as a strictly Puritan poetess she did only one part of her work.\r\nShe was even more interesting as an early champion of her sex. She did\r\nnot go so far as to assert equality of the sexes; that was too far in\r\nadvance of the age for her imagination. But she did contend that women\r\nshould be given credit for whatever was worth \"small praise.\" This\r\nappears again and again in her shorter poems.\r\n\r\n      Let Greeks be Greeks, and women what they are\r\n      Men have precedency and still excell,\r\n      It is but vain unjustly to wage warre;\r\n      Men can do best, and women know it well;\r\n      Preheminence in all and each is yours;\r\n      Yet grant some small acknowledgment of ours.\r\n\r\nNaturally she was full of pride in the achievements of Queen Elizabeth,\r\na pride which she expressed in a fine song \"In Honour of that High and\r\nMighty Princess\":\r\n\r\n      From all the Kings on earth she won the prize.\r\n      Nor say I more then duly is her due,\r\n      Millions will testifie that this is true.\r\n      She hath wip'd off th' aspersion of her Sex,\r\n      That women wisdom lack to play the Rex:\r\n      Spains Monarch, sayes not so, nor yet his host:\r\n      She taught them better manners, to their cost.\r\n      The Salique law, in force now had not been,\r\n      If France had ever hop'd for such a Queen.\r\n      But can you Doctors now this point dispute,\r\n      She's Argument enough to make you mute.\r\n      Since first the sun did run his nere run race,\r\n      And earth had once a year, a new old face,\r\n      Since time was time, and man unmanly man,\r\n      Come shew me such a _Phoenix_ if you can?\r\n\r\nThen follows a recital of Elizabeth's proudest triumphs, and assertions\r\nof how far she surpassed Tomris, Dido, Cleopatra, Zenobya, and the\r\nconclusion:\r\n\r\n      Now say, have women worth? or have they none?\r\n      Or had they some, but with our Queen is't gone?\r\n      Nay Masculines, you have thus taxt us long,\r\n      But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong.\r\n      Let such as say our Sex is void of Reason,\r\n      Know tis a Slander now, but once was Treason.\r\n\r\nAnne Bradstreet foreshadowed the \"woman's movement\" of to-day by two\r\nfull centuries, and thus showed how even the daughter of one Puritan\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts and the wife of another could be thinking and\r\naspiring far in advance of her times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  OTIS, W.

Government in America has always, in\r\nits broad aspects, reflected the will of the people. If legislators\r\nand legislation have been vicious, it has been because the majority of\r\nthe people have not cared enough about it to see that good men were\r\nchosen. If stupid and blundering laws have been passed, it has been\r\nbecause the people were not wide awake enough to analyze them. On the\r\nother hand old laws, unadjusted to modern conditions, have often become\r\n\"dead letters\" because the majority did not wish to have them enforced,\r\neven though they were on the statute books; and new and progressive\r\nlegislation has been imposed on reluctant lawmakers by the pressure\r\nof public opinion. Now the Puritan uprising in England had been a\r\ndemocratic movement by a people who wanted to have a hand in their own\r\ngovernment. It was a religious movement, because in England Church\r\nand State are one and because the oppression in religious matters had\r\nbeen particularly offensive. And in England it had been on the whole\r\nsuccessful in spite of the restoration of kingship in 1660, for from\r\nthat time on the arbitrary power of king and council were steadily and\r\nincreasingly curbed. As a consequence there was a parallel movement\r\nin the democracy across the sea. American colonists with a highly\r\ndeveloped sense of justice resented a bad royal governor like Andros,\r\nand were able to force his withdrawal; and they resented unreasonable\r\ndomination by the clergy, and were independent enough to shake it\r\noff. Between 1690 and 1700 Harvard College became for the first time\r\nsomething more than a training school for preachers; the right to vote\r\nin Boston was made to depend on moral character and property ownership\r\ninstead of on membership in the church; and in the midst of the Salem\r\nwitchcraft hysteria judges and grand-jurymen caught their balance and\r\nrefused any longer to act as cat's-paws of the clergy. The passage to\r\nthe eighteenth century was therefore a time of transition in common\r\nthinking; and the record of the change is clearly discernible in the\r\nliterary writings of the old-line conservatives Cotton and Increase\r\nMather, in the Diary of Samuel Sewall, who was able to see the light\r\nand to change slowly with his generation, and in the Journal of Sarah\r\nKemble Knight, who represented the silent unorthodoxy of hundreds of\r\nother well-behaved and respectable people.\r\n\r\nThe Mathers, Increase (1639-1723) and Cotton (1663-1728), were the\r\nsecond and third of a succession of four members of one family who\r\nwere so popular and influential as to deserve the nickname which is\r\nsometimes given them of the \"Mather Dynasty.\" These two were both born\r\nin America, educated in Boston and at Harvard, and made church leaders\r\nwhile still young men. In age they were only twenty-four years apart,\r\nand from 1682 to 1723 they worked together to uphold and increase the\r\npower of the church in New England. Because of their prominence as\r\npreachers they inherited the \"good will\" which had belonged to their\r\ngreatest predecessors, and by their own industry, learning, eloquence,\r\nand general vigor they added to their ecclesiastical fortunes like\r\nskillful business men. Their congregations were large and respectfully\r\nattentive; scores of their sermons were reprinted by request; on\r\nall public occasions and in all public discussions they were at the\r\nforefront. They were great popular favorites, and in the end they\r\nsuffered the fate of many another popular favorite. For the deference\r\nwhich was given to them year after year made them vain and domineering;\r\nthey talked too much and too long and too confidently, and they made\r\nthe mistakes of judgment which men who talk all the time are bound to\r\nmake. When Increase Mather lost the presidency of Harvard in 1701 they\r\nboth acted like spoiled children; their prestige was already on the\r\nwane, for when the reaction had followed the witchcraft delusion, to\r\nwhich they had fanned the flames, the caution which they had advised\r\nwas forgotten, and the encouragement which they had given was held\r\nup against them. To the ends of their lives, in 1723 and 1728, they\r\nwere proudly unrelenting, but their last years were embittered by the\r\nknowledge that their power was departed from them.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of their authorship was prodigious, even though most of\r\nit was in the form of pamphlets or booklets, for it amounted in\r\nthe case of Increase to about one hundred and fifty titles, and in\r\nthe case of Cotton to nearly four hundred. But they are chiefly\r\nremembered for three books: \"An Essay for the recording of Illustrious\r\nProvidences,\" by the elder; and \"The Wonders of the Invisible World\"\r\nand the \"Magnalia Christi Americana: Or the Ecclesiastical History of\r\nNew-England,\" by the younger. The first two of these are unintended\r\nexplanations to the twentieth-century reader as to how a whole\r\ncommunity could ever have been swept into the Salem witchcraft excesses\r\nof 1692. Any educated man who should advance the theories to-day which\r\nwere soberly expounded by these two really learned men would be held up\r\nto scorn and very possibly be made subject of a sanity investigation.\r\nYet two hundred years ago the world was ignorant of the commonplaces\r\nof science. Popular superstition therefore ran riot; and the belief\r\nthat God would interpose in the affairs of daily individual life, and\r\nthat a personal devil was walking up and down the earth seeking whom\r\nhe might devour, added to the confusion. Medicine in those days was\r\nhardly a science even in the broadest sense of the word. Physicians\r\ndepended for honest effects on a few simple herb remedies and on\r\npowerful emetics and the letting of blood. The populace believed in\r\ncuratives which still are resorted to only by children and the most\r\nignorant of grown-ups--like anointing implements with which they had\r\nbeen injured, in order to heal cuts and bruises, or like being touched\r\nby the monarch as a remedy for scrofula, the \"king's evil.\" Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, a well-known subject of Charles II, reported that he overcame a\r\npersistent illness by having the fumes of camomile poured into his ear.\r\nThe same sort of speculation prevailed in all the other sciences; and\r\nside by side with it superstition flourished. Between 1560 and 1600 in\r\nthe little kingdom of Scotland, which had a population no larger than\r\nthat of Massachusetts to-day, there were eight thousand executions for\r\nwitchcraft,--an average of nearly four a week; and James I, who was\r\nScotland's gift to England, was the author of a work on demonology.\r\n\r\nWhat the New Englanders, and among them the Mathers, believed was,\r\ntherefore, not unusual at the time. In fact the Mathers were both\r\nsomewhat less credulous than their fellows, but they only substituted\r\none superstition for another. Their way of casting off the old and\r\nvulgar beliefs which were pagan in origin was to contend that these\r\nvain and foolish ideas were put into Christian minds by Satan and his\r\nemissaries. Said Increase Mather in his \"Illustrious Providences\":\r\n\r\n  Some also have believed that if they should cast Lead into the Water,\r\n  then _Saturn_ would discover to them the thing they inquired after.\r\n  It is not _Saturn_ but _Satan_ that maketh the discovery, when\r\n  anything is in such a way revealed. And of this sort is the foolish\r\n  Sorcery of those Women that put the white of an Egg into a Glass of\r\n  Water, so that they may be able to divine of what Occupation their\r\n  future husbands shall be. It were much better to remain ignorant\r\n  than thus to consult with the Devil. These kind of practices appear\r\n  at first blush to be Diabolical; so that I shall not multiply Words\r\n  in evincing the evil of them. It is noted that _the Children of\r\n  Israel did secretly those things that are not right against the Lord\r\n  their God_ 2 King. 17. 9. I am told there are some who do secretly\r\n  practice such Abominations as these last mentioned, unto whom the\r\n  Lord in mercy give deep and unfeigned Repentance and pardon for their\r\n  grievous Sin.\r\n\r\nThese preachers thus turned superstition into an enemy of the true\r\nreligion, as it assuredly is; but they regarded it not as the fruit\r\nof ignorance, to be remedied by education and intelligence, but as a\r\ndevice of Satan which could be offset by preaching and prayer. The\r\ntwo books are cut from the same cloth, so that an indication of the\r\ncontents of the one just mentioned will give an idea of them both.\r\nThe chapter headings run as follows: Of Remarkable Sea Deliverances;\r\nPreservations; Lightening; Philosophical Meditations; Things\r\nPreternatural [voices of invisible speakers and doings of mysterious\r\nmischief-makers]; That there are Daemons and Possessed Persons [three\r\nmain arguments: (1) Scripture forbade witchcraft, therefore there must\r\nbe such a thing; (2) experience has made it manifest; (3) convicted\r\nmaldoers have confessed it]; Apparitions; Conscience; Deaf and Dumb\r\nPersons; Tempests; Earthquakes; and Judgments. As a whole the book is a\r\ncollection of curious anecdotes taken on almost any hearsay, but almost\r\nall at second or third hand. They resemble some of the most popular of\r\nthe atrocity stories which have been told during every war that history\r\nchronicles, but which no investigator has been able to run down in\r\nany single instance. In point of superstition the Mathers, to repeat,\r\nshould be considered in two lights: compared with educated men of the\r\ntwentieth century they were almost incredibly primitive in what they\r\nwere willing to believe, but considered with reference to their own\r\ngeneration they fought the wiles of the devil as soldiers of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe most ambitious work that either produced was Cotton Mather's\r\n\"Magnalia,\" a history of the Church in New England. This was a bulky\r\ntwo-volume effort, divided into seven parts, or books. As a matter\r\nof fact it was really a general history of the region by a man who\r\nregarded the existence of New England as identical with the existence\r\nof the Church. In this basic assumption as well as in many of his\r\ndetails Cotton Mather revealed himself as a hopeless conservative of\r\nhis day--hopeless because it was already evident to all but him and his\r\nkind that the State was shaking off the control of the Church leaders.\r\nOne can get a fair idea of the bias of the book from the opening\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n  It is the Opinion of some, though 'tis _but_ an _Opinion_, and\r\n  _but_ of _some_ Learned Men, That when the Sacred Oracles of Heaven\r\n  assure us, _The Things under the Earth_ are some of those, _whose\r\n  Knees are to bow in the Name of Jesus_, by those _Things_ are meant\r\n  the Inhabitants of _America_, who are Antipodes to those of the\r\n  other _Hemispheres_. I would not quote any words of _Lactantius_,\r\n  though there are _some_ to countenance this Interpretation, because\r\n  of their being so _Ungeographical_: nor would I go to strengthen\r\n  the Interpretation by reciting the Words of the _Indians_ to the\r\n  first _White Invaders_ of their Territories, _We hear you are come\r\n  from under the World, to take our World from us._ But granting the\r\n  _uncertainty_ of such an Exposition, I shall yet give the Church of\r\n  God a certain account of these _Things_, which in _America_ have\r\n  been Believing and Adoring the glorious _Name_ of Jesus; and of that\r\n  Country in America, where those _Things_ have been attended with\r\n  Circumstances most remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe \"Magnalia\" is really an attempt at a general history of New England\r\nfrom 1620 to 1698, containing classified material on the governors,\r\nmagistrates, and preachers, a history of Harvard, a collection of\r\nreports of church transactions, an account of the Indian Wars, and \"A\r\nFaithful Record of many Illustrious Wonderful Providences.\" Yet for\r\nhistorical data it is almost as unreliable as the libelous \"New English\r\nCanaan\" of Thomas Morton. For Morton was no more eager to turn the\r\nfacts to the discredit of the Puritans than Mather was to interpret\r\nthem to the glory of the Church; and the consequence was that neither\r\ncould be absolutely trusted. The historians have abandoned Mather as a\r\nsafe authority. His sin has found him out, even though he committed it\r\nin the name of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe man in this period in whom complete faith can be put is Samuel\r\nSewall, who did not profess to be an author except in an incidental\r\nway. He lived from 1652 to 1730 and kept a very full diary from 1673\r\nto 1729. This was written with no thought of publication, and actually\r\nwas not printed until a hundred and fifty years later, when it was\r\ngiven to the world by the Massachusetts Historical Society. In American\r\nliterature Sewall's Diary occupies a place almost exactly parallel to\r\nthat of John Evelyn's in English letters. Their lives and their long\r\ndiaries covered about the same years, and they held corresponding\r\npositions in the communities. Both were educated men--Sewall was a\r\ngraduate of Harvard--and both were highly respected and trusted.\r\nSewall held a minor position at Harvard connected with the library,\r\nwas prominent in church affairs, and was a judge, officiating at the\r\ntime of the Salem witchcraft trials. An informal journal written\r\nwithout prejudice, by such a man as he, gives material of the greatest\r\nvalue for a picture of the times. It is material of course and not\r\nthe picture itself, for it lacks anything in the way of composition,\r\njust as do the facts of ordinary daily life in the order of their\r\noccurrence. But out of it two main threads of interest may be unwoven.\r\nOne is the sober but not unrelieved background of the times, itself a\r\ncomposite of various strands. Religion was its strongest fiber. Few\r\nweeks pass in which there is no record of sermon, fast, christening,\r\nwedding, funeral, or special celebration. These were among the chief\r\nsocial happenings of the calendar. Funerals as well as more festive\r\noccasions were accompanied with gifts of gloves and rings; refreshments\r\nwere ample if not lavish; and the bill for strong drinks was always a\r\nheavy item, for it must be remembered that prohibition is of recent\r\norigin, and that among the Puritans self-control made drunkenness as\r\ninfrequent as drinking was common. Against frivolity too they set their\r\nminds; and Sewall's Diary gives a protest at \"tricks\" and dancing and\r\nMay festivals, and even Christmas and Easter, which were triply hated\r\nbecause they had their origins in pagan tradition and had come to the\r\npresent through the Church of Rome and the Church of England. Yet the\r\nobjections to these practices and festivals show that they were real\r\ndisturbances in Sewall's Boston, as were the roistering of sailors and\r\nother strangers in town.\r\n\r\nThe other and more important thread is the revelation of the inner\r\nmind of a flesh-and-blood colonial American. It takes patient reading\r\nto recreate the real man; but he is here in these pages, with all the\r\ninconsistencies that make up life out of story-books. He was all in all\r\na fine, devout, broad-gauge man--and this is what any biographer would\r\ntell of him--with a moderate supply of littleness and petty vanity,\r\nwhich the biographer would be almost certain to suppress. And he was\r\nin himself a record of the public opinion of his generation. He wrote\r\ntwo other things besides his Diary. One is a theological treatise which\r\nwas as uninspired as the quoted paragraph from Mather's \"Magnalia,\"\r\nand on much the same theme. It shows him to be an apparently hopeless\r\nold fogy. The other is a pamphlet called \"The Selling of Joseph,\"\r\nwhich was probably the first antislavery utterance printed in America,\r\nand implies that Samuel Sewall was centuries ahead of the times.\r\nThere is at second glance nothing perplexing in this contradiction.\r\nSewall was a normal man who stood between the oldest-fashioned and the\r\nnewest-fashioned thinkers. Sometimes he leaned backward, and sometimes\r\nforward; but on the whole he was inclined to advance. Of this he gave\r\none famous proof. Five years after the Salem trials he had the honesty\r\nto admit to himself that he had been all wrong in his judgment, and the\r\ncourage to make a public confession of his repentance. He chose one of\r\nthe hardest ways of doing it. Among the \"curious punishments of bygone\r\ndays,\" one was the humiliation of disreputable persons by forcing\r\nthem to sit at the foot of the church pulpit while the minister read\r\na public reproof. On Fast Day, 1697, Samuel Sewall of his own choice\r\nposted a bill which could be read by any who would, and, giving a copy\r\nof it to the Reverend Mr. Willard, stood up at the reading before the\r\ncongregation. The method of atoning for his mistake proves that he was\r\nstill a devout and faithful Puritan worshiper, but the fact that he did\r\nso at all shows that he could confess errors, even when they had been\r\ncommitted in behalf of the Church. The Mathers could neither have seen\r\nnor acknowledged such mistakes. They were too cocksure of being always\r\nright. So life passed on, leaving them by the wayside; and Samuel\r\nSewall was with the quiet majority who sadly left them behind.\r\n\r\nA third representative of the attitudes of mind at the changing of the\r\ncenturies was a genial woman, Mrs. Sarah Kemble Knight (1666-1727).\r\nShe was not in any sense a public figure, like the preachers and\r\nthe judge just mentioned, nor did she pursue the habit of writing a\r\ncontinued diary like Sewall's. Most emphatically she was not given\r\nto the unwholesome recording, like many other women in her day, of\r\n\"itineraries of daily religious progress, aggravated by overwork,\r\nindigestion, and a gospel of gloom.\" But there was one itinerary which\r\nshe did record for her own satisfaction and which was published more\r\nthan a century later, in 1825,--her \"Journal of a Journey from Boston\r\nto New York in 1704.\" At this time a vigorous woman of thirty-eight,\r\na wife and a mother, she set out alone on the ten-day journey, taking\r\nsuch guides as she could engage from one stage to the next. The\r\nhardships were considerable and the discomforts and inconveniences\r\nvery great; and the striking fact about them is that she bore up under\r\nthem in a good-humored, matter-of-fact, sort of twentieth-century\r\nway. An accident was an accident and not a visitation from on high; a\r\ndisagreeable or churlish or even a dishonest person was somebody to\r\nbe put up with and not to be moralized on as unscriptural. The worst\r\ninnkeeper she encountered was a man to avoid in the future rather than\r\na man to convert; she did not seem shocked by a drunken quarrel late\r\none night, but she was annoyed, because she wanted to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nShe was at times positively frivolous and irreverent in her allusions.\r\nCrossing a river one day she was very near to being tipped over.\r\n\r\n  The canoe was very small and shallow, so that when we were in [it]\r\n  seemed ready to take in water, which greatly terrified me, and caused\r\n  me to be very circumspect, sitting with my hands fast on each side,\r\n  my eyes steady, not daring so much as to lodge my tongue a hair's\r\n  breadth more on one side of my mouth than t' other, nor so much as to\r\n  think on Lot's wife; for a wry thought would have overset our wherry.\r\n\r\nHer jests about the name of the innkeeper, Mr. Devil, would have landed\r\nher in the stocks had she made them publicly in Boston.\r\n\r\n  The post encouraged me by saying we should be well accommodated at\r\n  Mr. Devil's, a few miles further; but I questioned whether we ought\r\n  to go to the Devil to be helped out of affliction. However, like the\r\n  rest of the deluded souls that post to the infernal den, we made all\r\n  possible speed to this Devil's habitation; where, alighting in good\r\n  assurance of good accommodations, we were going in.\r\n\r\nThe accommodations turned out to be anything but good; and she left her\r\nhost with a sigh of relief, and the thought \"He differed only in this\r\nfrom the old fellow in t' other country--he let us depart,\" following\r\nthe observation with a rimed warning for subsequent travelers to avoid\r\nthis earthly hell. These are quoted not because they are admirable or\r\nworthy of imitation but because they give an indication of what was\r\ngoing on under one very respectable bonnet when Mrs. Knight was sitting\r\ndecorously in her Boston pew. She was a highly respected woman in the\r\nPuritan community. She was accustomed to its ways. There is no word of\r\nmotherly regret that she was away from her little daughter on Christmas\r\nDay, for Christmas was not a festal day in her calendar. Of the people\r\nwho were coming into manhood and womanhood when Sarah Kemble Knight\r\nwas born, Hawthorne wrote in \"The Scarlet Letter\": \"The generation\r\nnext to the early immigrants wore the blackest shade of Puritanism,\r\nand so darkened the national visage with it, that all the subsequent\r\nyears have not sufficed to clear it up. We have yet to learn again the\r\nforgotten art of gayety.\"\r\n\r\nIt was men like the author of the \"Magnalia\" who had darkened the\r\nnational visage, but women here and there, like the writer of this\r\nJournal, who had already returning gleams of gayety. Of the three\r\npeople whom we have taken as types of New-England thought at this\r\nperiod, Cotton Mather may fairly be regarded as representing the\r\nfaith of a declining theology, Samuel Sewall the hope of a broader\r\nand more generous civic attitude, and Mrs. Knight as the flicker of\r\ncharity or warm-hearted and genial fellow-feeling which had been almost\r\nextinguished in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  CHAMBERLAIN, N.

This may best be selected from promising suggestions in\r\nthe first few pages of reading. If none appears, look for any of the\r\nfollowing or others like them: Sunday observance; funerals, weddings,\r\nand christenings; the pastor and his people; holidays; parents\r\nand children; self-analysis; religious discipline; law and order.\r\nComparisons on a given topic with the entries for the same period in\r\nEvelyn or for an equal number of pages in Pepys are fruitful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA similar approach may be made to Mrs. Knight's compact and consecutive\r\nJournal.

White and\r\nHackett in the _New Republic_, May 17, 1919. Do either or both throw\r\nlight on the chief characters discussed in this chapter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                 JONATHAN EDWARDS AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe danger in drawing conclusions about a whole century, as we have\r\nbeen doing, is that the facts may be forced to seem far simpler than\r\nthey were. It should be kept in mind that these are only certain broad\r\ncurrents of thought, tendencies which were obscured by all sorts of\r\ncross waves and chop seas. And it should be mentioned that the Puritan\r\nwith the greatest mind of them all, Jonathan Edwards, was only a year\r\nold when Mrs. Knight made her journey to New York, and that to the end\r\nof his life, in 1758, he struggled in vain to keep alive the logic of\r\nthe old religious doctrines.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1703 with a rich heritage from the learned aristocracy.\r\nAs a youth he showed extraordinary precocity, which appeared in his\r\nearly excursions into philosophy and natural science and developed\r\nfurther in the unfulfilled promise of religious radicalism.\r\n\r\n  From my childhood up, my mind had been full of objections against\r\n  the doctrine of God's sovereignty, in choosing whom he would to\r\n  eternal life, and rejecting whom he pleased; leaving them eternally\r\n  to perish, and be everlastingly tormented in hell. It used to appear\r\n  like a horrible doctrine to me. But I remember the time very well,\r\n  when I seemed to be convinced, and fully satisfied, as to this\r\n  sovereignty of God.... I have often, since that first conviction,\r\n  had quite another kind of sense of God's sovereignty than I had\r\n  then. I have often since had not only a conviction, but a delightful\r\n  conviction. The doctrine has very often appeared exceedingly\r\n  pleasant, bright, and sweet. Absolute sovereignty is what I love to\r\n  ascribe to God. But my first conviction was not so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POINTS OF LITERARY INTEREST IN NEW ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n  The first instance that I remember of that sort of inward, sweet\r\n  delight in God and divine things that I have lived much in since, was\r\n  on reading those words, 1 Tim. i. 17, _Now unto the King eternal,\r\n  immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever\r\n  and ever, Amen._ As I read the words, there came into my soul, and\r\n  was as it were diffused through it, a sense of the glory of the\r\n  Divine Being....\r\n\r\n  Not long after I first began to experience these things, I gave an\r\n  account to my father of some things that had passed in my mind. I was\r\n  pretty much affected by the discourse we had together; and when the\r\n  discourse was ended, I walked abroad alone, in a solitary place in my\r\n  father's pasture, for contemplation. And as I was walking there, and\r\n  looking up on the sky and clouds, there came into my mind so sweet a\r\n  sense of the glorious _majesty_ and _grace_ of God, that I know not\r\n  how to express. I seemed to see them both in a sweet conjunction;\r\n  majesty and meekness joined together; it was a sweet and gentle, and\r\n  holy majesty; and also a majestic meekness; an awful sweetness; a\r\n  high, and great, and holy gentleness.\r\n\r\nThe striking fact about Edwards's later development, however, is\r\nthat he passed entirely from poetic mysticism to a championship of\r\nthe theology of Calvin. His great period of influence was during\r\nhis pastorate in Northampton, Massachusetts, from 1727 to 1750, and\r\nduring his following six years at Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He was\r\na preacher of extraordinary power--the more extraordinary because his\r\ncommand of audiences was obtained by the sheer quality of his discourse\r\nand not, as in the case of John Cotton and the Mathers, by pulpit\r\npresence or flights of eloquence. His sermons were at once irresistible\r\nin their logic (provided his auditors were willing to start with his\r\nassumptions) and, at the same time, irresistibly cogent in their\r\nsimple, concrete methods of illustration. His most famous discourse,\r\n\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\" is a complete illustration\r\nof his method. Notwithstanding his sincerity and his talents as a\r\npreacher his ministerial experience was ended with a tragic downfall.\r\nHis parishioners could not endure the rigor of his teachings, agreeing\r\nperversely with Dr. Johnson's later dictum on his \"Freedom of the\r\nWill\"--that all theory might be for it but all experience was against\r\nit. During his residence in Stockbridge he continued with the writing\r\nof discourses which philosophers have agreed at once to applaud and\r\nreject. He died in 1758 shortly after his inauguration as president of\r\nthe College of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nHis failure lay in the fact that his religion was a religion of logic\r\nrather than of faith. It was based on what learned men had theorized\r\nout from the Bible, and in a great many cases from the least important\r\npassages of the Bible, and it sternly rejected what many other equally\r\nlearned men had found in the same book. Moreover, it was concerned\r\nwith life on earth chiefly as a prelude to a future life of reward\r\nor punishment. In all the tide of human event which was making the\r\neighteenth century each year more interesting as a matter of present\r\nliving, men could not go on indefinitely looking everywhere but at life\r\nitself. Oliver Wendell Holmes summed up the situation in his \"Wonderful\r\n'One-Hoss Shay'\" (see p. 305). This is a pleasant story for children,\r\nbut a comment on life for grown-ups; and to the grown-ups Holmes\r\naddressed his concluding couplet:\r\n\r\n      End of the wonderful one-hoss shay:\r\n      _Logic_ is _logic_. That's all I say.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790) is the man who reflected better and\r\nearlier than other Americans the complete change from the Puritan point\r\nof view--reflecting it so unqualifiedly that he must be understood as\r\nan extreme case and not a typical one. In education and character he\r\noffered a succession of contrasts to the leaders of seventeenth-century\r\nNew England. He did not come of a cultured family; he was not a college\r\nman; he did not enter any of the learned professions--ministry, law, or\r\nteaching; he was not an active supporter of the church; he did not live\r\nin the New England where he was born. In fact he was one of the first\r\nto act on the much-quoted principle, \"Boston is a very good place--to\r\ncome from.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin was born in Boston in 1706, the youngest son of a\r\ntallow-chandler and the fifteenth of seventeen children. He was\r\nindustrious and bookish as a boy, and before he was seventeen years\r\nold he had trained himself to write in the fashion of the English\r\nessayist Joseph Addison, had been apprenticed in his brother's printing\r\nshop, and had written many articles published in his brother's paper,\r\n_The New England Courant_. In 1723, as the result of troubles with his\r\nbrother, he ran away to Philadelphia. From there he went to London\r\nfor two years, on the promise of the irresponsible Governor Keith\r\nto set him up in the printing business on his return. The failure\r\nof the governor to keep his word did him no harm in the end, for he\r\nestablished his own printing house in 1728, and in 1748, at the age of\r\nforty-two, he was able to retire with a moderate fortune. During this\r\ntime he had not only succeeded in Philadelphia but had combined with\r\npartners in New York, Newport, Lancaster (Pennsylvania), Charleston\r\n(South Carolina), Kingston, Jamaica, and Antigua.\r\n\r\nThe activities of his life were so crowded and interwoven that they\r\nmay best be summarized under a few simple heads. As a public-spirited\r\ncitizen of Philadelphia he organized a debating society, the Junto, in\r\n1727; published _The Pennsylvania Gazette_ in 1729; founded the first\r\ncirculating library in America in 1731; conducted _Poor Richard's\r\nAlmanac_ from 1732 to 1748; organized the American Philosophical\r\nSociety in 1744; and in 1749 founded the academy which developed\r\ninto the University of Pennsylvania. As an inventor he perfected the\r\nFranklin stove in 1742 and contrived methods of street paving and\r\nlighting which were widely adopted. As a scientist he proved the\r\nidentity of lightning and electricity in 1752, and went on from that to\r\nfurther investigations which sooner or later brought him election to\r\nthe Royal Academy of London and their Copley gold medal, an appointment\r\nas one of the eight foreign associates of the French Academy of\r\nSciences, and medals and diplomas from other societies in St.\r\nPetersburg, Madrid, Edinburgh, Padua, and Turin. As a holder of public\r\ntrusts and offices he became clerk of the Assembly of Pennsylvania in\r\n1736; postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737; deputy postmaster-general\r\nof the colonies in 1753; commissioner from Pennsylvania to the Albany\r\nCongress in 1754; colonial agent to London from Pennsylvania in\r\n1757 and 1764 and for Massachusetts in 1770; one of the framers of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence; minister to the French court from\r\nthe United States in 1778; a signer of the Peace Articles in 1783;\r\npresident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1785-1787; and a\r\nframer of the Constitution of the United States. Such a catalogue is\r\nnot a thing to be exactly memorized. Its value is like that of an\r\nentry in \"Who's Who in America\"--it should be referred to when needed.\r\nYet it is worth reading and rereading as an evidence of the almost\r\nunparalleled variety and usefulness of occupations which filled this\r\nman's life.\r\n\r\nUsefulness is, without question, the idea which Franklin most\r\nemphasized in his writings and exemplified in his conduct. In\r\ncomparison with the Puritan fathers he was more interested in the\r\neighteenth century than in eternity, more actively concerned with\r\nPhiladelphia and Pennsylvania and the United States of America than\r\nwith the mansions prepared above. This attitude of mind was not a\r\nfreakish or accidental one; it can be accounted for in the influences\r\nwhich affected him when he was a boy and in the kind of English and\r\nAmerican thinking which characterized his whole century.\r\n\r\nHe came of what he himself called an \"obscure family,\" his ancestors\r\nin the near generations having been hard-working, intelligent English\r\nclerks and artisans. They were nonconformists, and independent enough\r\nto take their chances in the new world for the sake of liberty of\r\nconscience. But the lesson that he learned from his parents was rather\r\nmore practical than theological and was, perhaps unconsciously,\r\nattested to in the epitaph which he wrote for them. At two points in it\r\nhe recorded his belief that God helps them who help themselves, laying\r\nspecial stress on the degree to which they help themselves:\r\n\r\n          By constant labor and industry,\r\n            With God's blessing,\r\n\r\nhe says, and again:\r\n\r\n          Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling\r\n            And distrust not Providence.\r\n\r\nCotton Mather, whom Franklin quoted with respect, would have reversed\r\nthe ideas in order and importance; but it was Cotton Mather's \"Essays\r\nto Do Good\" that Franklin quoted, and his ability to draw a practical\r\ninference from some slight event (\"Be not too proud,\" he said, when he\r\nbumped his head against a beam), and not any of his sermons. Franklin's\r\nearly reading was almost wholly in the field of what might be called\r\ncommon-sense literature--discussions of different aspects of daily\r\nlife and how to get on in it. He read \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" which\r\nof all religious books is one of the most definite on questions of\r\nearthly conduct. He read a great deal of history and biography: Defoe\r\n\"Upon Projects,\" Locke \"Concerning Human Understanding\" and \"The Art\r\nof Thinking,\" and Addison on all the common-sense subjects that make\r\nup the contents of the _Spectator_. He read the rimed \"Essays\" of\r\nAlexander Pope, too, using a quotation from one of them to confirm his\r\nbelief in a system of arguing by means of asking questions, which is\r\nknown as the \"Socratic method.\"\r\n\r\nIn a word, he filled his boyish mind with the special kind of writing\r\nwhich belonged to the first half of the eighteenth century in England,\r\nand this was exactly the kind to be valuable to a youth who was\r\ndestined to work his way unaided to prosperity. For this period was a\r\nparticularly prosaic and practical one. In the two generations just\r\ngone England had passed through the Puritan uprising against Charles\r\nI, the return of the Stuarts to the throne, and the further rebellion\r\nagainst James II. Religious enthusiasm had risen to its height in the\r\nmiddle of the century, but had already waned by the years when John\r\nMilton received only ten pounds for the manuscript of \"Paradise Lost.\"\r\nBy the end of the century politics had definitely overthrown religion\r\nas a subject of popular discussion. Little newspapers had sprung\r\nup in surprising numbers, the coffeehouses had provided centers for\r\nconversation, and a common-sense age was settling down to a rather\r\nsordid and common-sense existence. Sometimes under the impulse of a\r\nworld movement a few leaders of thought have a great deal to do with\r\nactually molding the character of the period in which they live, but\r\nin less inspiring times the popular writers produce just about \"what\r\nthe public wants.\" The period of Franklin's youth was one of the\r\nlatter kind, and Addison, Pope, and their followers were writing for\r\na public who wanted to keep on the surface of life. It was as if the\r\npeople had said: \"All this religious zeal of the last century only\r\nmade England uncomfortable. Just see what confusion it threw us into!\r\nNow we are back about where we were when the trouble started. Let's be\r\nsensible and stick to facts, and stop quarreling with each other.\" So\r\nthe populace, who began reading in greater numbers than ever before,\r\nread the little newspapers; and the various groups of congenial people\r\ntalked things over in the coffeehouses; and Addison made it his\r\nambition to bring \"philosophy\" (by which he meant a simple theory of\r\neveryday living) down from the clouds and into the field of ordinary\r\nthinking. The plays of Shakespeare would have helped Franklin very\r\nlittle in the early stages of the printing business; so would the poems\r\nof Milton; but the essays of Addison, Pope, and Defoe made for him what\r\nwould be called to-day \"excellent vocational reading.\" And he profited\r\nby it to the limit.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if literature helped to make him a good printer, printing was\r\nno less helpful toward making him a good writer. There are few trades\r\nor crafts which demand so high a degree of accuracy. A boy or girl who\r\nachieves a grade of 95 per cent in any study, even in mathematics, is\r\nwell above the average; but a typesetter or proofreader who avoids\r\nerror in only nineteen out of every twenty operations will have a short\r\ncareer in any printing house. Most people do not know of the extreme\r\ncare which is given to assure correctness in the simplest product\r\nwhich is put into type. A textbook, for example, after being written,\r\nrevised, recopied, and revised is criticized by a special expert and\r\nonce more revised before the publisher's editor goes over it word by\r\nword. Then when it goes to the printer it is set up in long strips,\r\nor galleys, from these into pages (still in type), and from these is\r\ncast into plates, and after each of these three operations is read\r\nover with microscopic care by both an editorial proofreader and the\r\nauthor. During the printing experience a liberal allowance is made to\r\nthe author for actual changes from his original copy, but the printer\r\nis held responsible for any slightest departure from the manuscript\r\nthat is supplied him. The boy who, like Franklin, has spent some years\r\nin the printing room and the editorial office has received a discipline\r\nwhich is miles beyond that which can ever be given in any school or\r\ncollege composition course.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] This same discipline was enjoyed--among later American\r\n      authors--by Mark Twain, Bret Harte, William Dean Howells, and\r\n      Walt Whitman, all of whom were scrupulously careful writers.\r\n\r\nTo this important training Franklin added a conscious attempt to\r\ndevelop his own powers. Printing and the love of books led the horse\r\nto water, but his desire for self-expression made him drink. Of this\r\nhe tells in an early passage of the \"Autobiography.\" His daily work\r\nhad taught him to spell and punctuate correctly, but he was faulty in\r\nchoice of words and in \"perspicuity,\" or clearness of construction. So\r\nhe took Addison's _Spectator_ as his model, put paragraphs into his own\r\nwords, then tried to set them back into the original form, compared\r\nthe two products, and made up his mind wherein Addison's versions were\r\nbetter than his and wherein, as he sometimes thought, his were better\r\nthan his teacher's. He also followed up the art of discussion both\r\nin speech and in writing, making it always a point to convince his\r\nopponents without antagonizing them. These things he did, not in order\r\nto become a professional writer but solely in order to utter or write\r\nhis ideas to the best effect. \"It has ever since,\" he says, \"been a\r\npleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools; and it has been\r\nuseful to me, having learned so much by it as to be able to do little\r\njobs myself.\" Prose writing was simply a tool for him--the most useful\r\none that he ever mastered and, as he says elsewhere, the principal\r\nmeans of his advancement.\r\n\r\nAs long as he was a printer (until he was forty-two years old) he\r\nemployed his prose composition in writing copy which was clear and\r\ninteresting and therefore salable--chiefly in the _Pennsylvania\r\nGazette_ and in _Poor Richard's Almanac_; but during and after that\r\ntime he put his powers to even greater use as a speaker and as a writer\r\nof articles and pamphlets on affairs of public interest. He was almost\r\nalways simple, definite, and practical, for he wrote to the mass of\r\npeople with little education. He realized that if he was to bring his\r\npoints home to them he must not write \"over their heads,\" and that he\r\nmust appeal to their common sense and their self-interest; and he was\r\ninvariably good-humored, for he knew that good humor makes more friends\r\nthan enemies.\r\n\r\nOut of the great mass of Franklin's published writings--and they run\r\nto a dozen large volumes--two deserve special attention as pieces of\r\nAmerican literature: _Poor Richard's Almanac_ and the \"Autobiography.\"\r\nThe former of these was a commercial undertaking; it was written to\r\nsell. The almanac, an annual publication of which the calendar was\r\na very small part, had been popular in England and America for many\r\ngenerations before Franklin started his own. It preceded the newspaper\r\nand until 1800, or even later, reached a wider public. The second\r\npiece of printing in this country was _Pierce's Almanack_, printed in\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, in 1639. Others followed: in Boston, 1676;\r\nin Philadelphia, 1676; in New York, 1697; in Rhode Island, 1728; and\r\nin Virginia, 1731. There had been, however, only one great almanac\r\neditor to precede Franklin in America--Nathaniel Ames, who began\r\npublishing his series in Dedham, Massachusetts, in 1726. Besides the\r\ncalendar, the astronomical data for the year, and the half-jocular\r\nweather predictions, the chief feature of Ames's was the poetry, very\r\nconsiderable in bulk, and the \"interlined wit and humor,\" which was\r\nbrief and usually rather pointless. Franklin, realizing the fondness\r\nof his generation for the wise sayings of which Alexander Pope was\r\nthen the master-hand in the English-speaking world, dropped the poetry\r\nand studied to expand the interlined material of Ames into the chief\r\ncontribution of his \"Richard Saunders.\" \"I endeavored to make it\r\nboth entertaining and useful,\" he said in the \"Autobiography,\" \"and\r\nit accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reaped considerable\r\nprofit from it; vending annually near ten thousand. And observing\r\nthat it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the province\r\nbeing without it, I considered it as a proper vehicle for conveying\r\ninstruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any other\r\nbooks. I therefore filled all the little spaces, that occurred between\r\nthe remarkable days in the Calendar with proverbial sentences, chiefly\r\nsuch as inculcated industry and frugality, as the means of procuring\r\nwealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult for a man\r\nin want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs,\r\n_it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Almanac of 1757 he collected the sayings of the last twenty-five\r\nyears into a timely essay on \"The Way to Wealth,\" making an old man\r\ndeliver a speech filled with quotations from \"Poor Richard.\" This\r\ncontained not only sound practical advice for any time but was also\r\npertinent to a political issue of the moment, and so applied to the\r\nstate as well as to all the people in it. It was reprinted by itself\r\nand had an immense circulation in America and abroad, in the original\r\nand in several translations. Very likely since \"The Day of Doom,\" in\r\n1662, nothing had been so influential in the colonies as \"The Way to\r\nWealth,\" in 1757; and no contrast could better indicate the change\r\nthat had taken place between those two dates. Said Father Abraham, the\r\nold speaker:\r\n\r\n  It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People\r\n  one-tenth Part of their Time, to be employed in its Service. But\r\n  _Idleness_ taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent\r\n  in absolute _Sloth_, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent\r\n  in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by\r\n  bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. _Sloth, like rust,\r\n  consumes faster than Labour wears; while the used Key, is always\r\n  bright_, as _Poor Richard_ says. _But dost thou love life, then do\r\n  not squander Time, for that's the stuff Life is made of_, as _Poor\r\n  Richard_ says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep,\r\n  forgetting that _The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry_, and that\r\n  _There will be sleeping enough in the Grave_, as _Poor Richard_ says.\r\n\r\nThis was the sort of workaday advice that was shouldering the old-time\r\ntheology into modest Sabbath-day retirement.\r\n\r\nFranklin's \"Autobiography\" is the greatest of his writings if not\r\nthe greatest of all his achievements. \"Poor Richard\" and \"The Way\r\nto Wealth\" are full of good common sense, but they belong only to\r\nthe \"efficiency\" school of ideas and morality; they are neither\r\ndistinguished in form nor inspiring in content, and they are\r\nchiefly interesting because they so well mirror what was in the\r\neighteenth-century mind. The \"Autobiography\" has a larger claim to\r\nattention than these, for by general consent it has come to be regarded\r\nas one of the great classics of literature. Several features have\r\ncombined to make it deserve this high place. Simply stated they are\r\nall nothing more than ways of explaining that this book is the simple,\r\ndefinite, honest life-story of an eminent man, as he recalled it in his\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is simple and uncalculated. It was not composed,\r\nlike \"Poor Richard,\" to sell, nor, like many of Franklin's speeches\r\nand pamphlets, to convince by skillful argument. As a matter of fact,\r\nFranklin did not want to write it at all, and consented only when\r\nthe insistence of his friends and relatives made it easier to do it\r\nthan to leave it undone. Moreover, he dropped it for the thirteen\r\nyears from 1771 to 1784, took it up again when wearied, old, and ill,\r\nand left it at his death hardly more than well started, with all the\r\nmost celebrated part of his life still to be recounted. It is simple\r\ntherefore because it was done with no desire to create an impression\r\nor to be \"literary,\" and is the unadorned narrative of an old man\r\nfamiliarly told to those who knew him best.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason it is definite and homely in what he chose to\r\nrecord. It is the \"little, nameless, unremembered\" episodes not set\r\ndown in more pretentious histories for which the \"Autobiography\" is\r\nitself best remembered. Some of the details make real the conditions of\r\nliving in those simple times--the invention of the stove named after\r\nhim, the improvements in street lighting and paving, the organization\r\nof a fire company. Others are typical of human nature in any age,\r\nas his portrait of the croaker, Samuel Mickle, who sadly predicted\r\nFranklin's failure as a printer, or as his jocular account of the\r\nentrance of luxury into his own household.\r\n\r\n  We have an English proverb that says, _He that would thrive, must\r\n  ask his wife_. It was lucky for me that I had one as much disposed\r\n  to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me cheerfully\r\n  in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop,\r\n  purchasing old linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc. We kept\r\n  no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of\r\n  the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time bread and\r\n  milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer,\r\n  with a pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and\r\n  make a progress, in spite of principle: being called one morning to\r\n  breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They\r\n  had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost\r\n  her the enormous sum of three and twenty shillings, for which she\r\n  had no other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought _her_\r\n  husband deserved a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his\r\n  neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our\r\n  house, which afterward in a course of years, as our wealth increased,\r\n  augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.\r\n\r\nMany and many of the simplest episodes reveal how shrewd, penetrating,\r\nand, above all, how clear headed he invariably was. Such, for example,\r\nwas the hour when he was listening to the great evangelist, Whitefield,\r\nand while all his other auditors were being thrilled by the speaker's\r\neloquence, Franklin was backing away from him step by step, in order\r\nto estimate how far his voice would carry, and thus to verify the\r\nnewspaper accounts of his having preached to twenty-five thousand\r\npeople in the fields. Franklin went away full of admiration for the\r\npreacher's voice, but with no word of comment on his sermon. He went\r\noften to hear Whitefield, but always as a very human public speaker and\r\nnever as a \"divine.\" A biographer, even one of his associates, could\r\nnot have known many of the intimate facts that Franklin included, and\r\nhe would almost surely have left out other details as irrelevant or\r\nimpertinent. Franklin himself, in contrast, wrote the things which\r\nstill clung in his old man's memory and which must have been important\r\nin his development, or he would have forgotten them.\r\n\r\nAnother striking feature of the \"Autobiography\" is its honesty, for he\r\ndid not hesitate to record happenings which revealed defects in his\r\ncharacter--defects which nine out of ten admiring biographers would\r\nhave been inclined to omit or even actually to cover up. Franklin knew\r\nthat his life had not been all admirable, that many times it had not\r\nbeen above reproach; but, all things considered, he was willing to let\r\nit stand for what it was. In consequence, if one reads his story as\r\nhonestly as Franklin wrote it,--and few people do,--it will appear that\r\nnot only was he disorderly and unmethodical but that he was not always\r\ntruthful, that he was sometimes unscrupulous in business, and that he\r\nwas at times self-indulgent and immoral. In fact too often the editing\r\nof Franklin's life-story seems to have been done on the principle\r\nlaid down by Dr. Samuel Johnson about Chesterfield's \"Letters to his\r\nSon\"--that they should be put into the hands of every young man after\r\nthe immorality had been taken out of them. This is not honest teaching\r\nand does not lead to honest habits of study.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Franklin was like other people in being a combination\r\nof virtues and defects. He was unlike other people in having\r\nextraordinary talents and virtues and in owning up to his defects. For\r\nthe two great \"errata\" of his life--the use of money intrusted to him\r\nfor Mr. Vernon and his unfaithfulness while in London to Miss Read, his\r\nbetrothed--he afterward made the fullest possible atonement. In his\r\nglorification of usefulness at every turn he was at once the greatest\r\nexpounder and the greatest example of his century. He made a religion\r\nof usefulness, putting it into a simple creed which gives less heed to\r\nthe spirit of worship than many of us need, but far more to the spirit\r\nof service than most of us follow:\r\n\r\n  It is expressed in these words, viz.:\r\n\r\n  That there is one God, who made all things.\r\n\r\n  That he governs the world by his providence.\r\n\r\n  That he ought to be worshipped by adoration, prayer and thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n  But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\r\n\r\n  That the soul is immortal.\r\n\r\n  And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either\r\n  here or hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the third of these articles Franklin recommended a worship which he\r\ndid not practice, but in the fourth he presented a doctrine of service\r\nof which his life was a remarkable fulfillment. In his theory of life\r\nFranklin seemed to make no claims for the finer emotions, but in his\r\nactual citizenship in all its public aspects he was so far above the\r\naverage man as to serve as a pretty safe \"working model\" for this and\r\ncoming generations.\r\n\r\nIf he had not written this uncompleted life-story we should not know\r\nthe man as intimately as we do, for to read the \"Autobiography\" is to\r\nread Franklin himself.\r\n\r\nSince the \"Autobiography\" brings the story of Franklin only up to 1757,\r\nit gives no hint of the Revolutionary struggle in which as negotiator\r\nand diplomat he was hardly less important than was Washington as\r\nmilitary leader. The America presented in these pages is loyal and\r\ncontented. The rising voices of discomfort from 1765 to 1775, of doubt\r\nduring the next year, and of decision for revolt in 1776 were all\r\nechoed and often led by Franklin in his political writings. Moreover,\r\nit is of especial significance in these days to recall another fact\r\nunrecorded in his own story--that he was the first American to\r\nrepresent his nation among other nations, and that in his feeling for\r\nAmerica as a member of the great world-family he was a hundred years\r\nand more ahead of his countrymen. The new marshaling of forces in 1917\r\nwhich brought about the celebration of the Fourth of July in London and\r\nthe arrival of allied American troops in Paris recalled from hour to\r\nhour the name of Franklin as our first great international figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  BROOKS, VAN WYCK.

It is quite worth study\r\nto read at first-hand one or two sermons about which so many careless\r\ngeneralizations have been made. The chief points of interest are the\r\ntheology as it stands in his own living words, and his rhetorical\r\nmethod, which is an admirable exercise of forensic discourse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRead Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"The Minister's Wooing\" and \"Oldtown\r\nFolks\" (especially chap. ) for a faithful portrait of one of Edwards's\r\nchief successors (see pp. 305-308).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRead Franklin's \"Autobiography\" for its revelation of personal\r\ncharacteristics: his continued emphasis on usefulness; his refusal to\r\nallow his emotions to carry him away (whether anger, love, religious\r\nfervor, or desire for revenge); his willingness to act unscrupulously\r\nfor what he felt was a good end; his self-analysis (in other places\r\nthan the passage on the virtues); his public spirit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRead Franklin's \"Autobiography\" for its literary characteristics:\r\nhis emulation of Addison's style (compare passages of this and\r\nthe _Spectator_); his respect for Pope and his likeness in use of\r\napothegms; his similarity to Chesterfield in point of view and use of\r\nhomely detail. Contrast Franklin's style with Irving's or Cooper's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                    CRÈVECOEUR, THE \"AMERICAN FARMER\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1750 the thirteen colonies had all been long established, and the\r\nstraggling community on the Atlantic seaboard from Maine to Georgia\r\nhad an individuality of its own. The America-to-be was at once young\r\nand old. There were old towns, old churches, old homes, old families.\r\nThere was an aristocracy with memories that went back to England, but\r\nwith roots firmly planted in American soil. Yet, withal, the country\r\nwas so vast and the people on it so few that there was unlimited\r\nchance for the energetic man of real ability. It was a new land of\r\nuntold opportunities; all its apparent maturity was the maturity of a\r\nwell-born young gentleman who has just become of age and whose real\r\ncareer is all before him. The old age of the Old World was something\r\nvery different, for it was based chiefly on the control of the land--of\r\nthe actual soil and stream and forest. Edmund Burke in 1775 said in\r\nhis \"Speech on Conciliation of the American Colonies\" that if the\r\nattempt were made to restrict the population of the colonies the\r\npeople could swarm over the mountain ranges and resettle there in a\r\nvast plain _five hundred miles square_. However fair the estimate was\r\nto the land in actual English possession, that statement was about\r\nas far as the imagination of an Englishman accustomed to smaller\r\ndimensions could then go, or as big a figure as he could dare to hope\r\nhis fellow-members of Parliament would believe; for in those days, as\r\nto-day, there were not in England or France five square miles of land\r\nout of ownership, and very little that was not in the possession of\r\na few great proprietors. As the control of government was largely in\r\nthe same hands, the great mass of the people could neither freely\r\nenjoy the fruits of their own labor, which were pitilessly reduced by\r\nrents and taxes, nor make any effective peaceful protest in behalf of\r\npolitical change. The American Revolution was the voice of the colonies\r\nprotesting against the possible repetition of such conditions on this\r\nside the water, and the French Revolution was the harsh voice of a\r\ndowntrodden people calling for redress.\r\n\r\nNo man could better appreciate the promise of life in America than one\r\nwho had felt the oppression of the old conditions and had then enjoyed\r\nthe freedom of the new ones. In the same years when the wiser leaders\r\nin the colonies were viewing with alarm the aggressive and mistaken\r\npolicies of George III and his ministers, a young Frenchman, educated\r\nin England, came over to this country, settled and prospered on his own\r\nland, and was so delighted with his life as a farmer and a citizen that\r\nhe could not refrain from making a record of his happy circumstances.\r\nThis was Michel Guillaume St. John de Crèvecoeur, and his book was\r\nthe \"Letters from an American Farmer,\" published in London in 1782,\r\nthough written almost entirely before the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\nIt is made up of twelve so-called letters addressed to an imaginary\r\nEnglish friend. Two of these are about his direct experience on his own\r\nacres in the middle colonies; five are on the people and the country\r\nin northern colonies, as he found them in Marthas Vineyard, Nantucket,\r\nand Cape Cod; one is drawn from observations in South Carolina; and the\r\nother four are less related to definite places, three being on nature\r\nthemes, and one--the most important of all--on the ever-new question,\r\n\"What is an American?\"\r\n\r\nWith industry and frugality hardly less than Franklin's, Crèvecoeur\r\nhad also a certain power of poetic imagination and fresh enthusiasm.\r\nHe was writing from a kind of earthly paradise. Seen against the\r\nbackground of unhappy France, the rights to own, to earn, and to have\r\na voice in governing himself seemed almost too good to be true. He had\r\nno misconceptions about the hard labor which was necessary to make\r\na farm productive; but he enjoyed work because he knew that he could\r\nenjoy the fruits of it, and he enjoyed it all the more because he knew\r\nthat in making an ear of corn grow where none had grown before he was\r\nthe best kind of pioneer. To his sorrow he knew much about the ugliness\r\nof an old civilization; it was with the zest of a youthful lover that\r\nhe wrote about the beauty of this new country's inexperience.\r\n\r\nHe felt a perfect satisfaction in his own state of mind and body.\r\nAlthough he was a newcomer, he had a sense of belonging to the district\r\nas complete as Emerson, with two centuries of ancestry, was later\r\nto have; and, with a pride equal to Emerson's in \"Hamatreya,\" could\r\n\"affirm, my actions smack of the soil.\" With his baby boy ingeniously\r\nrigged before him on the plow, he reckoned the increase of his fields,\r\nherds, flocks,--even his hives,--and acknowledged his inferiority \"only\r\nto the Emperor of China, ploughing as an example to his kingdom.\" Then,\r\nlooking beyond his own little acreage, he hinted at future industries.\r\nHe was tilling the surface; there must be further treasures below. He\r\nand his neighbors were weaving the natural wool; some chemist must\r\nmake and prepare colors. Commerce must follow on the heels of abundant\r\nproduction; \"the avenues of trade are infinite.\" And in time the\r\ndeep vast of the West, about which men had yet such feeble and timid\r\nfancies, must be explored and subjugated in its turn.\r\n\r\n  Here we have, in some measure, regained the ancient dignity of our\r\n  species: our laws are simple and just; we are a race of cultivators;\r\n  our cultivation is unrestrained, and therefore everything is\r\n  prosperous and flourishing. For my part I had rather admire the ample\r\n  barn of one of our opulent farmers, who himself felled the first\r\n  tree in his plantation, and was first founder of his settlement,\r\n  than study the dimension of the temple of Ceres. I had rather record\r\n  the progressive steps of this industrious farmer, throughout all the\r\n  stages of his labor and other operations, than examine how modern\r\n  Italian convents can be supported without doing anything but singing\r\n  and praying.\r\n\r\nMoreover, above all the material resources of field, forest, and\r\nmountain, he was glad for the human stream which was flowing into\r\nAmerica to fertilize them. The thrifty people who were shrewd and bold\r\nenough to come over from Great Britain and northern Europe were to\r\nprofit by nature's gifts, and in the experience were to be welded \"into\r\none of the finest systems of population which has ever appeared.\" If it\r\nis fair to say that the history of immigration to America falls into\r\nthree general periods, Crèvecoeur was writing about the very midst\r\nof the middle period, from 1675 to 1875. First had been a half century\r\nwhen only the strongest spirit of adventure or the strongest desire\r\nfor freedom could impel men to attempt the conquest of an untried\r\nworld. Every Englishman who came over and every American born here was\r\nconscious of the need of more hands to work, and all were eager for\r\nmore Englishmen, and yet more, to help in the gigantic undertaking. In\r\nthe last forty years, with the taking up of all the available land and\r\nthe manning of the industries, the millions who have flooded in, not\r\nalone from England or Great Britain but mainly from southern Europe and\r\nthe near East, have arrived as new mouths to feed. The problem has been\r\nnot so much how they could help America as how America could take care\r\nof them; and with their arrival a feeling of perplexity and alarm has\r\narisen such as was expressed in 1892 by Thomas Bailey Aldrich in his\r\n\"Unguarded Gates\":\r\n\r\n      ... Wide open and unguarded stand our gates,\r\n      And through them presses a wild motley throng--\r\n      Men from the Volga and the Tartar steppes,\r\n      Featureless figures of the Hoang-Ho,\r\n      Malayan, Scythian, Teuton, Kelt, and Slav,\r\n      Flying the Old World's poverty and scorn;\r\n      These bringing with them unknown gods and rites,\r\n      Those, tiger passions here to stretch their claws.\r\n      In street and alley what strange tongues are loud,\r\n      Accents of menace alien to our air,\r\n      Voices that once the Tower of Babel knew!\r\n\r\n          O Liberty, white Goddess! is it well\r\n      To leave the gates unguarded? ...\r\n                                Have a care\r\n      Lest from thy brow the clustered stars be torn\r\n      And trampled in the dust....\r\n\r\nBut Crèvecoeur was living between these two periods. The first conquest\r\nof the Eastern woods and fields had been made. America was known to be\r\na land of plenty, and as yet there was more than plenty for all the\r\nnewcomers from England and the neighboring countries of northern Europe.\r\nThere seemed to be no limit to its resources. And so he wrote:\r\n\r\n  What, then, is the American, this new man? He is neither a European,\r\n  nor the descendant of a European: hence that strange mixture of\r\n  blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out\r\n  to you a family, whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife\r\n  was Dutch, whose son married a Frenchwoman, and whose present four\r\n  sons have now four wives of different nations. He is an American,\r\n  who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners,\r\n  receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the\r\n  new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds. He becomes an\r\n  American by being received in the broad lap of our great \"alma\r\n  mater.\" Here individuals are melted into a new race of men, whose\r\n  labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world.\r\n  Americans are the western pilgrims, who are carrying along with them\r\n  that great mass of arts, sciences, vigor and industry, which began\r\n  long since in the East. They will finish the great circle.\r\n\r\nThere was an artistic strain in this man who could so easily kindle\r\nwith enthusiasm and who could express his enthusiasms with such\r\nrhythmic eloquence. The special subjects on which he could best vent\r\nhis poetic powers were found in his passages and his occasional whole\r\nchapters on nature themes--in particular the letters on \"John Bartram,\r\nBotanist,\" and \"The Snakes and the Humming Bird.\" In these it is\r\nimpossible not to feel the resemblances between this early naturalist\r\nand his successor, Thoreau (see pp. 222-229). While neither was a\r\nscientist in the strict sense of the word, neither was content to\r\ndismiss nature subjects with mere words of general appreciation. Both\r\nwere interested enough to observe in detail and to record with some\r\nexactness the ways of plants, flowers, birds, and insects; but both\r\nwere at their best when they were giving way to the real zest they had\r\nin the enjoyment of the out of doors.\r\n\r\n  Who can listen unmoved to the sweet love-tales of our robins, told\r\n  from tree to tree, or to the shrill cat-birds? The sublime accents\r\n  of the thrush, from on high, always retard my steps, that I may\r\n  listen to the delicious music.... The astonishing art which all birds\r\n  display in the construction of their nests, ill-provided as we may\r\n  suppose them with proper tools, their neatness, their convenience,\r\n  always make me ashamed of the slovenliness of our houses. Their love\r\n  to their dame, their incessant, careful attention, and the peculiar\r\n  songs they address to her while she tediously incubates their eggs,\r\n  remind me of my duty, could I ever forget it. Their affection to\r\n  their helpless little ones is a lovely precept; and, in short, the\r\n  whole economy of what we call the brute creation, is admirable in\r\n  every circumstance; and vain man, though adorned with the additional\r\n  gift of reason, might learn from the perfection of instinct, how to\r\n  regulate the follies, and how to temper the errors, which this second\r\n  gift often makes him commit.... I have often blushed within myself,\r\n  and been greatly astonished, when I have compared the unerring path\r\n  they all follow,--all just, all proper, all wise, up to the necessary\r\n  degree of perfection--with the coarse, the imperfect, systems of men.\r\n\r\nFor generations the beauties of nature had held small place in English\r\nliterature, because the English men of letters were a completely\r\ncitified set of writers; and they had received little attention in\r\nAmerica, partly because England gave American writers no reminder and\r\npartly because nature in America had been chiefly something to struggle\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nSo enthusiastic was Crèvecoeur over conditions in America, and so\r\ncertain was he that they never would be disturbed in any unfortunate\r\nway, that the twentieth-century reader looks over his pre-Revolution\r\npages with a kind of wistful impatience. About many aspects of the\r\nmaterial development of the country Crèvecoeur was keenly prophetic.\r\nThroughout eleven of the letters, evidently written before 1775, he\r\ncontinued in an exalted and confident mood. Whether he was presenting\r\nthe \"provincial situations, manners and customs\" of Nantucket and\r\nMarthas Vineyard, or of the central Atlantic, or of the Southern\r\ncolonies, his senses and his judgment were equally satisfied. Industry\r\nprevailed. The wilderness was being converted into towns, farms, and\r\nhighways. \"A pleasing uniformity of decent competence\" was a rule of\r\nthe democracy. The indulgent laws were fair to the laborer and the\r\nvoter. He seemed to feel that the era of prosperity would last till\r\nthe end of the world. His vision of the future was the vision of a man\r\nperched in the small end of an infinite horn of plenty, with a vista\r\nunclouded by the hint of any limit to the supply or of any possible\r\nconflict between gluttony and hunger.\r\n\r\nIn fact, along the whole coast there was only one practice which\r\ndeserved the name of a problem, and that was the institution of\r\nslavery. Against this, which existed both North and South, Crèvecoeur\r\nprotested just as Samuel Sewall and John Woolman had done before him,\r\nand as Timothy Dwight and Joel Barlow in Connecticut and William\r\nPinkney and other lawmakers and abolitionists in Maryland and Virginia\r\nwere to do soon after him. Yet, however sincere he was, he regarded\r\nslavery only as an external blemish rather than as a national danger.\r\nIt was a mistake, but not a menace. It was typical of the America\r\nof the future that Crèvecoeur should have had so unquestioning a\r\nconfidence in the prospect. The belief in a \"manifest destiny\" for\r\nAmerica, which is finely inspiring for all who will work to bring\r\nabout a glorious future, has been demoralizing to millions who have\r\nused a lazy belief in it to excuse them from feeling or exercising any\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWith the twelfth letter came a total change of key. It was evidently\r\nwritten long after all the others, after the outburst of war, perhaps\r\nafter his New Jersey property had been burned, possibly even during\r\nhis return voyage to France in the autumn of 1780. As a naturalized\r\nsubject of King George, when well on in middle life he had been\r\nforced to choose between his sworn allegiance and the interests of\r\nhis fellow-colonists. He sympathized with the American cause, though\r\nhe did not enlist. And then in the years that followed he learned\r\n(the perennial lesson of war time) of the \"vanity of human wishes.\"\r\nUnhappily for the moral of the tale, the latter part of his life was\r\nfar from heroic. In the concluding letter, written quite after the\r\nfashion of the most sentimental and unreal eighteenth-century nature\r\nlovers, Crèvecoeur decided to abandon the struggle in the war zone\r\nand to take up life anew with his family among the Indians in the West.\r\nHe would forswear all talk of politics, \"contemplate nature in her\r\nmost wild and ample extent,\" and formulate among his adopted neighbors\r\na new system of happiness. As a matter of fact, however, his retreat\r\nwas even more complete than this; for he returned permanently to the\r\nContinent, lived contentedly in Paris, London, and Munich, married his\r\ndaughter to a French count, wrote volumes on Pennsylvania and New York,\r\nand memorialized his career as a farmer by inditing a paper on potato\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nAlthough such a turn of events resulted in very much of an anticlimax,\r\nthis fact should not make one forget the prophetic quality in his\r\n\"Letters,\" nor should his failure to predict every aspect of modern\r\nlife throw any shadow on the clearness with which he foretold some of\r\nthe most important of them. It is true, of course, that he did not\r\nappreciate how tragic were to be the fruits of slavery; that he saw\r\nimmigration only as a desirable supply of labor to a continent which\r\ncould never be overpopulated; that, writing before the earliest chapter\r\nof the factory era, he did not dream of the industrial complexities of\r\nthe present. But when he said that the American, sprung from Europe but\r\nhere adopted into a new nation, \"ought therefore to love this country\r\nmuch better than that wherein either he or his forefathers were born,\"\r\nhe was saying something that has been repeated with new conviction\r\nten thousand times since the outbreak of the Great War. And when he\r\ndeclared that \"the American is a new man, who acts upon new principles\"\r\nhe was foreshadowing national policies which the world has been slow\r\nto understand. The possibility of a nation's being too proud to fight\r\nat the first provocation, and the subordination of national interest\r\nto the interest of mankind--this is the language of the new principles\r\nthat Crèvecoeur was invoking. It is nearly a century and a half\r\nsince he tried to answer the question \"What is an American?\" Much has\r\nhappened since then. Internally the country has developed to the extent\r\nof his farthest dreams, and in the world-family, after five great wars,\r\nit has become one of the greatest of the powers, fulfilling so much of\r\nhis predictions that one speculates in all humility on what may be the\r\nnext steps \"for that new race of men whose labours and posterity will\r\none day cause great changes in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  MICHEL GUILLAUME ST.

Controversial pamphlets, state papers, diaries,\r\nletters, and journals, plays (with prologues and epilogues), songs,\r\nballads and satires, all swelled the total. No one can fully understand\r\nthe Revolution or the period after it who does not read extensively in\r\nthis material; yet, taken in its length and breadth, the prose and most\r\nof the verse are important as history rather than as literature. Out of\r\nthe numerous company of writers who were producing while Franklin was\r\nan aging man and while Crèvecoeur was an American farmer, one, Philip\r\nFreneau, may be considered as chief representative, and two others,\r\nFrancis Hopkinson and John Trumbull, deserve a briefer comment.\r\n\r\nFrancis Hopkinson (1737-1791), the Philadelphian, was well\r\ncharacterized in a much-quoted letter from John Adams to his wife in\r\nAugust, 1776:\r\n\r\n  At this shop I met Mr. Francis Hopkinson, late a mandamus councillor\r\n  of New Jersey, now a member of the Continental Congress, who ... was\r\n  liberally educated, and is a painter and a poet.... He is one of your\r\n  pretty little, curious, ingenious men.... He is genteel and well-bred\r\n  and is very social. I wish I had leisure and tranquillity of mind\r\n  to amuse myself with those elegant and ingenious arts of painting,\r\n  sculpture, statuary, architecture and music. But I have not.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Hopkinson's work savors of the dilettante throughout; yet\r\npart of its historical significance is inherent in this fact, for\r\nHopkinson is one of the earliest examples of talented versatility in\r\nAmerican life. He had virtues to complement the accomplishments half\r\nenviously cited by John Adams. He was a learned judge, a stalwart\r\nrevolutionist, a practical man of affairs, and a humorist.\r\n\r\nHis collected writings in three volumes were done in the best manner\r\nof eighteenth-century England. Five sixths of them are essays,\r\nwritten not in series, but quite of the _Spectator_ type. Three prose\r\nsatires--\"A Pretty Story\" (1774), \"A Prophecy\" (1776), and \"The New\r\nRoof\" (1778)--are as important a trio as any written by one man in the\r\nRevolutionary days. The other sixth--his verse--belonged no less to the\r\npolite literature of the period. There are Miltonic imitations, songs,\r\nsentiments, hymns, a fable, and a piece of advice to a young lady.\r\nThere are occasional poems, including birthday and wedding greetings,\r\ndramatic prologues and epilogues, elegies, and rimed epitaphs. Verses\r\nof these kinds, if they were all Hopkinson had written, would indicate\r\na hopeless subservience to prevailing English fashions. But Hopkinson\r\nwas nobody's vassal. When he wrote\r\n\r\n      My generous heart disdains\r\n        The slave of love to be,\r\n      I scorn his servile chains,\r\n        And boast my liberty,\r\n\r\nhe might as truly have asserted his refusal to submit to any sort of\r\ntrammels except at his own option. Into a few imitation ballads he\r\npoured the new wine of Revolutionary sentiment, one of which, \"The\r\nBattle of the Kegs,\" with its mocking jollity, put good cheer in all\r\ncolonial hearts in the times that tried men's souls. It was his jaunty\r\nself-control, the quality of heroism without its pompous mannerisms,\r\nthat set Hopkinson off in contrast with his fellows. He was almost the\r\nleast pretentious of them all, yet few were more effective.\r\n\r\nJohn Trumbull (1750-1831), most talented of the \"Hartford Wits,\" tried\r\nhis hand, like Hopkinson, at the conventional poetical subjects, but,\r\nunlike him, the bulk of his verse was contained in two long satirical\r\nessays: \"The Progress of Dulness\" (1772 and 1773) and \"M'Fingal\" (1776\r\nand 1782). Apparently he had no further ambition for himself or other\r\nAmerican poets than to\r\n\r\n          bid their lays with lofty Milton vie;\r\n      Or wake from nature's themes the moral song,\r\n      And shine with Pope, with Thompson and with Young.\r\n      This land her Swift and Addison shall view,\r\n      The former honors equalled by the new;\r\n      Here shall some Shakspeare charm the rising age,\r\n      And hold in magic chains the listening stage;\r\n      A second Watts shall strike the heavenly lyre,\r\n      And other muses other bards inspire.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in these two satires he wrote first from a provincial and\r\nthen from an early national point of view. \"The Progress of Dulness\"\r\nis a disquisition on how not to bring up children. He chose for his\r\nexamples Tom Brainless, Dick Hairbrain, and Harriet Simper. He put the\r\nboys through college (Trumbull was a graduate of Yale), making one a\r\ndull preacher and the other a rake. Harriet, the American counterpart\r\nof Biddy Tipkin in Steele's \"Tender Husband\" or Arabella in Mrs.\r\nLennox's \"The Female Quixote,\" is fed on flattery, social ambition, and\r\nthe romantic fiction of the hour (see p. 103), becomes a coquette and a\r\njilt, and, thrown over by Dick, sinks into obscurity as the faded wife\r\nof Parson Tom. This was homemade satire, democratic in its choice and\r\ntreatment of character, and clearly located in and about New Haven,\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nSo also, and much more aggressively, was the rimed political\r\ndocument \"M'Fingal,\" an immensely popular diatribe at the Tory of\r\nthe Revolution--his attitude, his general demeanor, and his methods\r\nof argument. It recounts the events of a day in a New England town\r\nwhich was torn by the dissensions between the rival factions in the\r\nopening days of the conflict, and describes in detail the ways in\r\nwhich this particularly offensive Tory was driven to cover. The modern\r\nreader must bring to it a good deal of student interest if he expects\r\nto complete the reading and understand it, even with the aid of\r\nTrumbull's copious footnotes. For the moment it was a skillful piece\r\nof journalistic writing. Trumbull knew how to appeal to the prejudices\r\nof his sympathizers (for controversial war writing confirms rather\r\nthan convinces); he knew how to draw on their limited store of general\r\nknowledge; and he knew how to lead them on with a due employment of\r\nliterary ingenuities like puns, multiple rimes, and word elisions,\r\nand a judicious resort to rough jocosity and vituperation. \"M'Fingal\"\r\nwas war literature with all its defects of passion, uncandor, and\r\nspeciousness, but the score or more of editions through which it ran\r\nbefore 1800 are evidence that it reached the low mark at which it was\r\naimed. If it had the faults of its kind, so in later years did \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin\" and \"Mr. Britling sees it Through.\"\r\n\r\nThis most representative poet of the Revolutionary period was Philip\r\nFreneau, who lived from 1752 to 1832 and who was active in authorship\r\nfor forty-five years, from 1770 on. He was a graduate of Princeton\r\nCollege in 1771, gained a sudden reputation as a political satirist in\r\n1775, and lived a strangely varied life from then till well into the\r\nnineteenth century. For three years he lived in Santa Cruz and Bermuda.\r\nIn 1779 he sailed to the Azores, and for a six-year period at a later\r\ntime he was engaged in Atlantic coast trade. From 1784 to 1807 he went\r\nthe circle in five stages as editor, seaman, editor, farmer, and seaman\r\nagain. Everything he did he seems to have done hard, and nothing held\r\nhim long. It is a kind of life which does not seem surprising in a\r\nman who has often been called \"Poet of the Revolution,\" for he wrote\r\nas vigorously as he sailed or farmed or edited, and he plowed his\r\npolitical satires quite as deep and straight as he plowed the seas and\r\nthe furrows of his fields. After his bitter experience of three months\r\non a British prison ship, he blazed out with a savage flame of verse\r\nwhich has carried the horrors of this particular form of war brutality\r\ndown the centuries to greet the \"atrocities\" of the present. When\r\nthe editors of rival papers and rival parties annoyed him he scourged\r\nthem with a savageness of attack which was notable even in a day when\r\njournalism knew no restraint and recognized no proprieties. Freneau had\r\nat least one title to the friendship of Dr. Samuel Johnson, who loved\r\n\"a good hater.\"\r\n\r\nThis vehement side of his life resulted in a generous amount of war\r\npoetry which would be remembered--or forgotten--with the best of the\r\nrest of its kind if it were all that he had written. In a brief survey\r\nlike the present chapter it can therefore serve the double purpose of\r\nillustrating the verse of the Revolution and of representing a less\r\nimportant aspect of his whole work. In this respect it is comparable\r\nto the Civil-War and antislavery poetry of Whittier. Sometimes this\r\nverse is full of scorn, as in \"The Midnight Consultations,\" in which\r\nLord Howe is ridiculed as presiding over a council which arrives at the\r\nfollowing heroic conclusion:\r\n\r\n      Three weeks--ye gods!--nay, three long years it seems\r\n      Since _roast beef_ I have touched, except in dreams,\r\n      In sleep, choice dishes to my view repair,\r\n      Waking, I gape and champ the empty air,--\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      On neighbouring isles uncounted cattle stray,\r\n      Fat beeves, and swine, an ill-defended prey--\r\n      These are fit victims for my noonday dish,\r\n      These, if my soldiers act as I would wish,\r\n      In one short week should glad your maws and mine;\r\n      On mutton we will sup--on roast beef dine.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is full of the hate which war always engenders. Freneau\r\nwrote no more bitterly about the king, Lord North, and the leading\r\ngenerals in active service against the colonists than did Jonathan\r\nOdell--the foremost Tory satirist--about Washington and his associates.\r\nAs the war went on, and the likelihood of American success became\r\nstronger, Freneau's tone softened, as he could well afford to have it,\r\nand in such a product as \"The Political Balance\" he wrote with nothing\r\nmore offensive than the mockery of a rather ungenerous victor. This\r\npoem, characterized by well-maintained humor, is one of the best of\r\nits kind. It represents Jove as one day looking over the book of Fate\r\nand of coming to an incomplete account of Britain, for the Fates had\r\nneglected to reveal the outcome of the war. In order to find out for\r\nhimself, he directs Vulcan to make an exact model of the globe, borrows\r\nthe scales from Virgo, and plans to foretell the future by setting\r\nthe mother country on one side and the States on the other. When,\r\nafter many difficulties, the experiment is tried, of course the States\r\noverbalance the little island. Then, to make sure, he adds the foreign\r\ndominions on Britain's side,\r\n\r\n      But the gods were confounded and struck with surprise,\r\n      And Vulcan could hardly believe his own eyes!\r\n\r\n      For (such was the purpose and guidance of fate)\r\n      Her foreign dominions diminish'd her weight--\r\n      By which it appeared, to Britain's disaster,\r\n      Her foreign possessions were changing their master.\r\n\r\n      Then as he replac'd them, said Jove with a smile--\r\n      \"Columbia shall never be rul'd by an isle--\r\n      But vapours and darkness around her shall rise,\r\n      And tempests conceal her a while from our eyes;\r\n\r\n      \"So locusts in Egypt their squadrons display,\r\n      And rising, disfigure the face of the day;\r\n      So the moon, at her full, has a frequent eclipse,\r\n      And the sun in the ocean diurnally dips.\r\n\r\n      \"Then cease your endeavors, ye vermin of Britain--\r\n      (And here, in derision, their island he spit on)\r\n      'T is madness to seek what you never can find,\r\n      Or think of uniting what nature disjoin'd;\r\n\r\n      \"But still you may flutter awhile with your wings,\r\n      And spit out your venom, and brandish your stings,\r\n      Your hearts are as black, and as bitter as gall,\r\n      A curse to yourselves, and a blot on the Ball.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the successful completion of the war it was only natural that\r\nAmericans in their rejoicing should imagine the glorious future that\r\nawaited their new independence. The more vivid their imaginations were,\r\nthe more splendid were the prophecies they indulged in. As we read\r\nover the records of their lofty hopes we are reminded of commencement\r\noratory; and the likeness is not unreal, for these post-Revolution\r\npoets were in fact very like eager college graduates, diploma in hand,\r\nlooking forward to vague but splendid careers. It was in these poems\r\ntoo that the germs of Fourth of July oratory first took root--the\r\noratory described by James Fenimore Cooper in his \"Home as Found\"\r\n(chap. xxi):\r\n\r\n  There were the usual allusions to Greece and Rome, between the\r\n  republics of which and that of this country there exists some such\r\n  affinity as is to be found between a horse-chestnut and a chestnut\r\n  horse, or that of mere words; and a long catalogue of national\r\n  glories that might very well have sufficed for all republics, both\r\n  of antiquity and of our own time. But when the orator came to speak\r\n  of the American character, and particularly of the intelligence of\r\n  the nation, he was most felicitous, and made the largest investments\r\n  in popularity. According to his account of the matter, no other\r\n  people possessed a tithe of the knowledge, or a hundredth part of the\r\n  honesty and virtue of the very community he was addressing; and after\r\n  laboring for ten minutes to convince his hearers that they already\r\n  knew everything, he wasted several more in trying to persuade them to\r\n  undertake further acquisitions of the same nature.\r\n\r\nThese elephantine poems were written each in several \"books,\" to each\r\none of which was prefixed an outline which, in the language of the day,\r\nwas called \"the argument.\" Here is a part of the outline for Book VII\r\nof Timothy Dwight's \"Greenfield Hill\" (1794):\r\n\r\n  Happiness of U. S. contrasted to Eastern Despotism. Universal\r\n  Prevalence of Freedom. Unfortified, and therefore safe, state\r\n  of U. S. Influence of our state of Society on the Mind. Public\r\n  Property employed for the Public Benefit. Penal Administrations\r\n  improved by Benevolence. Policy enlarges its scope. Knowledge\r\n  promoted. Improvements in Astronomical and other Instruments\r\n  of Science. Improvements of the Americans, in Natural\r\n  Philosophy--Poetry--Music--and Moral Science. State of the American\r\n  Clergy. Manners refined. Artificial Manners condemned. American\r\n  Women. Cultivation advanced. Other Nations visit this country, and\r\n  learn the nature, and causes, of our happiness. Conclusion.\r\n\r\nAnd here is a part of the argument to Book IX of Joel Barlow's\r\n\"Columbiad,\" in which he demonstrates that the present government of\r\nAmerica is a culmination of all human progress:\r\n\r\n  ... the ancient and modern states of the arts and of society,\r\n  Crusades, Commerce, Hanseatic League, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton,\r\n  Galileo, Herschel, Descartes, Bacon, Printing Press, Magnetic Needle,\r\n  Geographic Discoveries, Federal System in America.\r\n\r\nFreneau had shared all this prophetic enthusiasm, and had expressed\r\nit even before the war, partly in an actual commencement poem on \"The\r\nRising Glory of America\" and partly in a series of eighteen \"Pictures\r\nof Columbus.\" Just after graduation he had written:\r\n\r\n                                        I see, I see\r\n      A thousand Kingdoms rais'd, cities and men\r\n      Num'rous as sand upon the ocean shore;\r\n      Th' Ohio then shall glide by many a town\r\n      Of note; and where the Mississippi stream\r\n      By forests shaded now runs weeping on,\r\n      Nations shall grow, and States not less in fame\r\n      Than Greece and Rome of old; we too shall boast\r\n      Our Alexanders, Pompeys, heroes, kings,\r\n      That in the womb of time yet dormant lye\r\n      Waiting the joyful hour of life and light.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, however, he did not rejoin the increasing choir who were\r\nsinging this kind of choral. His most interesting bit of prophecy,\r\nwhich must have seemed to his contemporaries to be a piece of the\r\nairiest fancy, has been amazingly verified more than a century after he\r\nwrote it. This is \"The Progress of Balloons,\" written in the jaunty tone\r\nof \"The Political Balance\":\r\n\r\n      The stagemen, whose gallopers scarce have the power\r\n      Through the dirt to convey you ten miles in an hour,\r\n      When advanc'd to balloons shall so furiously drive\r\n      You'll hardly know whether you're dead or alive.\r\n      The man who at Boston sets out with the sun,\r\n      If the wind should be fair, may be with us at one,\r\n      At Gunpowder Ferry drink whiskey at three\r\n      And at six be at Edentown, ready for tea.\r\n      (The machine shall be order'd, we hardly need say,\r\n      To travel in darkness as well as by day)\r\n      At Charleston by ten he for sleep shall prepare,\r\n      And by twelve the next day be the devil knows where.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      If Britain should ever disturb us again,\r\n      (As they threaten to do in the next George's reign)\r\n      No doubt they will play us a set of new tunes,\r\n      And pepper us well from their fighting balloons.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Such wonders as these from balloons shall arise--\r\n      And the giants of old that assaulted the skies\r\n      With their Ossa on Pelion, shall freely confess\r\n      That all they attempted was nothing to this.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was newspaper poetry, and Freneau, for long years\r\nof his life, was a newspaper man. Even his lines \"To Sir Toby,\" a\r\nslaveholding sugar-planter in Jamaica, spirited as they are, are in\r\neffect an open letter in protest against human slavery, and they were\r\nprinted in the _National Gazette_ in 1792.\r\n\r\nThe really poetical work of Freneau, however, which entitles him to an\r\nattention greater than that for his fellows, had nothing to do with\r\npolitical or military events of the day. They were his shorter poems on\r\nAmerican nature and American tradition; and a distinguishing feature\r\nof them was that they were different from the English poetry of the\r\ntime, in form as well as in content. As a young man Freneau had set\r\nout on his career by writing after the style of Milton and Dryden and\r\nPope and their lesser imitators. This was absolutely natural. Until\r\nafter the Revolution, America was England; and it was more nearly like\r\nEngland in speech and in thought than much of Scotland and Ireland\r\nare to-day. All the refinements of America were derived from English\r\nsources; practically all the colonists' reading was from English\r\nauthors. But after the Revolution there came a strong reaction of\r\nfeeling. We can look to Freneau's own rimes (journalistic ones again)\r\nfor an explanation of the new and native quality of his later verse;\r\nthey are called \"Literary Importation,\" and they conclude as follows:\r\n\r\n      It seems we had spirit to humble a throne,\r\n      Have genius for science inferior to none,\r\n      But hardly encourage a plant of our own:\r\n          If a college be planned\r\n          'Tis all at a stand\r\n      'Till to Europe we send at a shameful expense,\r\n      To send us a bookworm to teach us some sense.\r\n\r\n      Can we never be thought to have learning or grace\r\n      Unless it be brought from that horrible place\r\n      Where tyranny reigns with her impudent face;\r\n          And popes and pretenders\r\n          And sly faith-defenders\r\n      Have ever been hostile to reason and wit,\r\n      Enslaving a world that shall conquer them yet.\r\n\r\n      'Tis a folly to fret at the picture I draw:\r\n      And I say what was said by a Doctor Magraw;\r\n      \"If they give us their Bishops, they'll give us their law.\"\r\n          How that will agree\r\n          With such people as we,\r\n      Let us leave to the learned to reflect on awhile,\r\n      And say what they think in a handsomer stile.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this feeling that America should be different,\r\nthe tendency grew to seek out native subject matter and to cease\r\nconscious imitation of English literary models. For the next half\r\ncentury American authors were contending, every now and then, that\r\nnative themes should occupy their attention, and a good deal of\r\nverse and prose was written with this idea in mind. Most of it was\r\nmore conscientious than interesting, for literature, to be genuinely\r\neffective, must be produced not to demonstrate a theory but to express\r\nwhat is honestly in the author's mind. The first step toward achieving\r\nnationality in American writing was, therefore, to achieve new and\r\nindependent habits of national thinking. The Irish mind, for example,\r\nis basically different from the English mind, and Irish literature has\r\ntherefore a long and beautiful history of its own, in spite of the fact\r\nthat Ireland is near to England and subject to it. But the Australian\r\nis simply a transplanted English-speaking, English-thinking mind, and\r\nAustralia has consequently produced no literature of which the world is\r\nyet aware.\r\n\r\nNow Freneau was a naturally independent thinker. He was educated and\r\nwell read in the best of English and classical literature. But unlike\r\nmost of his fellow authors, he was not a city man, nor a teacher,\r\npreacher, or lawyer. His hands were hardened by the steersman's\r\nwheel and the plow, and doubtless much of his verse--or at least the\r\ninspiration for it--came to him on shipboard or in the field rather\r\nthan in the library. In the midst of the crowd he was an easy man to\r\nstir up to fighting pitch. All his war verse shows this. Yet when he\r\nwas alone and undisturbed he inclined to placid meditation, and he\r\nexpressed himself in the simplest ways. As a young man he wrote a\r\nlittle poem called \"Retirement.\" It is the kind of thing that many\r\nother eighteenth-century poets--confirmed city dwellers--wrote in\r\nmoments of temporary world-weariness; but Freneau's life-story shows\r\nthat he really meant it:\r\n\r\n      A cottage I could call my own\r\n        Remote from domes of care;\r\n      A little garden, wall'd with stone,\r\n      The wall with ivy overgrown,\r\n        A limpid fountain near,\r\n      Would more substantial joys afford,\r\n        More real bliss impart\r\n      Than all the wealth that misers hoard,\r\n      Than vanquish'd worlds, or worlds restor'd--\r\n        Mere cankers of the heart!\r\n\r\nAnd there was another poem of his youth which told a secret of his\r\nreal character. This was \"The Power of Fancy,\" an imitation of Milton\r\nin its form, but genuinely Freneau's in its sentiment. The best of his\r\nlater work is really a compound of these suggestions--poems of fancy\r\ncomposed in retirement. Thus he wrote on \"The Indian Burying Ground,\"\r\ninterpreting the fact that\r\n\r\n      The Indian, when from life releas'd,\r\n        Again is seated with his friends\r\n      And shares again the joyous feast,\r\n\r\ninstead of being buried recumbent as white men are. And thus he wrote\r\nin \"To a Caty-did,\" \"The Wild Honeysuckle,\" and \"On a Honey Bee,\"\r\nlittle lyrics of nature and natural life, which were almost the first\r\nverse written in America based on native subject matter and expressed\r\nin simple, direct, and unpretentious form.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Ames, in one of his early almanacs, recorded soberly:\r\n\r\n                         MAY\r\n\r\n      Now Winters rage abates, now chearful Hours\r\n      Awake the Spring, and Spring awakes the Flowers.\r\n      The opening Buds salute the welcome Day,\r\n      And Earth relenting, feels the genial Ray.\r\n      The Blossoms blow, the Birds on Bushes sing;\r\n      And Nature has accomplish'd all the Spring.\r\n\r\nThis was perfectly conventional and perfectly indefinite; not a single\r\nflower, bud, blossom, bird, or bush is specified. The six lines amount\r\nto a general formula for spring and would apply equally well to\r\nPatagonia, Italy, New England, or northern Siberia. Mr. R. Lewis, who\r\nwrote on \"A Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis\" in 1730, improves on\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n      First born of _Spring_, here the _Pacone_ appears.\r\n      Whose golden Root a silver Blossom rears.\r\n      In spreading Tufts see there the _Crowfoot_, blue,\r\n      On whose green Leaves still shines a globous Dew;\r\n      Behold the _Cinque-foil_, with its dazling Dye\r\n      Of flaming Yellow, wounds the tender Eye.\r\n      But there enclos'd the grassy Wheat is seen\r\n      To heal the aching Sight with cheerful Green.\r\n\r\nLewis mentions definite flowers, colors, and characteristics, but\r\nhe never misses a chance to tuck in a conventional adjective or\r\nparticiple, and he is led by them into weaving the extravagant fancy\r\nof an eye made to ache by flaming and dazzling colors, and healed by\r\nthe cheerful green of the wheat field. In contrast to these, Freneau's\r\nlittle nature poems are as exact as the second and as simple as the\r\nsubject on which he writes:\r\n\r\n        In a branch of willow hid\r\n      Sings the evening Caty-did:\r\n      From the lofty locust bough\r\n      Feeding on a drop of dew.\r\n      In her suit of green array'd\r\n      Hear her singing in the shade,\r\n        Caty-did, Caty-did, Caty-did.\r\n\r\nSuch simplicity as this does not seem at all remarkable to-day, but if\r\nit be compared with the fixed formalities that belonged to almost all\r\nthe verse of Freneau's time it will stand out as a remarkable exception.\r\n\r\nOn account of the two kinds of poetry which Freneau published he has\r\noften been given misleading titles by his admirers. Those who have been\r\ninterested in him mainly or exclusively from the historical point of\r\nview have christened him the \"Poet of the American Revolution.\" This\r\nis unfair because of the implication that he gave his best energy to\r\nthis and had no other right to distinction. Even as a journalist he was\r\nmore than poet of the Revolution, since he wrote on local and timely\r\nthemes for many years after its close. This designation does not claim\r\nenough for him. The other title is defective for the opposite reason,\r\nthat it claims too much. This is the \"Father of American Poetry.\" Such\r\na sweeping phrase ought to be avoided resolutely. It is doubly false,\r\nin suggesting that there was no American poetry before he wrote and\r\nthat everything since has been derived from him. The facts are that he\r\nhad a native poetic gift which would have led to his writing poetry\r\nhad there never been a war between the colonies and England, but that\r\nwhen the war came on he was one of the most effective penmen on his\r\nside; that entrance into the field of public affairs diverted him from\r\nthe paths of quiet life; that after the war he continued both kinds of\r\nwriting. He never ceased wholly to think and write about \"affairs,\" but\r\nmore and more he speculated on the future, dreamed of the picturesque\r\npast, and played with themes of graceful and tender sentiment. He is\r\nvery much worth reading as a commentator on his own times, and he is no\r\nless worth reading for the beauty of many poems quite without reference\r\nto the time or place in which they were written.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long and fruitful colonial period must not be overlooked by any\r\nhonest student of American literature, yet it may fairly be regarded\r\nas no more than a preparatory stage. It has the same relationship to\r\nthe whole story as do the ancestry, boyhood, and education to the\r\ndevelopment of an individual. In the broad and brief survey attempted\r\nin these chapters a few leading facts have been reviewed about the\r\nyouth of America: (1) Everything characteristic of the early settlers\r\nwas derived directly from England, those in the South representing\r\nthe aristocratic traditions of king and court, and those in the\r\nNorth reflecting the democratic revolt of the Puritans. As a natural\r\nconsequence of these differences the writing of books soon waned in\r\nVirginia and the neighboring colonies, but developed consistently in\r\nMassachusetts and New England. (2) The attempt of the Puritans to\r\nforce all New Englanders to think the same thoughts and worship in the\r\nsame way was unsuccessful from the start, and the most interesting\r\nwriters of the seventeenth century reveal the spread of disturbing\r\ninfluences. The first three chosen as examples are Thomas Morton, the\r\nfrank and unscrupulous enemy of the Puritans; Nathaniel Ward, a sturdy\r\nPuritan who was alarmed at the growth of anti-Puritan influences; and\r\nRoger Williams, a deeply religious preacher, who rebelled against the\r\ncontrol of the Church in New England just as he and others had formerly\r\nrebelled in the mother country. (3) Even in the first half century a\r\ngood deal of verse was written: sometimes, as in the case of \"The Day\r\nof Doom,\" as a mere rimed statement of Puritan theology; but sometimes,\r\nas in the case of Anne Bradstreet and her followers, as an expression\r\nof real poetic feeling. (4) With the passage to the eighteenth century\r\nthe community was clearly slipping from the grasp of the Puritans.\r\nEvidence is ample from three types of colonists: the Mathers, who\r\nwere fighting a desperate but losing battle to retain control; Samuel\r\nSewall, who, although a Puritan, was willing to accept reasonable\r\nchanges; and Mrs. Sarah Kemble Knight, who said little at the time,\r\nbut in her private journals showed the existence of growing disrespect\r\nfor the old habits of thought. (5) Benjamin Franklin, whose work is\r\nmore valuable than that of any of his predecessors, is also completely\r\nrepresentative of the complete swing away from religious enthusiasm\r\nto a hard-headed worldliness which was prevailing in England in the\r\neighteenth century. (6) On the other hand, Crèvecoeur, writing just\r\nbefore the Revolution, sounded the note of thanksgiving to the Lord\r\nthat America was different from the Old World, and emphasized what were\r\nthe conditions of life that were worth fighting to save. (7) Finally,\r\nout of all the roster of talented writers during the Revolutionary War,\r\nFreneau was selected as the most gifted poet of the period, both as an\r\nindirect recorder of the conflict and as an author of poetry on native\r\nthemes in no way related to the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  ADAMS, H.

The only reprint available of Lewis's\r\ninteresting \"Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis\" is in \"American\r\nPoetry\" (P. H. Boynton, editor), pp. 24-29. These poems are chiefly\r\nsignificant for the combination of English form and American subject\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompare Trumbull's comments on the education of girls with the\r\ncorresponding passage by Mrs. Malaprop, in Sheridan's \"The Rivals,\" and\r\nwith Fitz-Greene Halleck's comments on the education of Fanny, in the\r\npoem of that name (see \"American Poetry,\" pp. 127, 128, and 155, 156).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompare Dwight's \"Farmer's Advice to the Villagers,\" \"Greenfield Hill,\"\r\nPt. VI, with Benjamin Franklin's \"The Way to Wealth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompare the nationalistic note in the seventh and ninth books of\r\nBarlow's \"Vision of Columbus\" with that in Timrod's \"Ethnogenesis\" and\r\nthat in Moody's \"Ode in Time of Hesitation.\" Do the dates of the three\r\npoems suggest a progressive change? (See \"American Poetry,\" pp. 123,\r\n349, and 577.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRead Freneau's more bitter war satires in comparison with Jonathan\r\nOdell's \"Congratulation\" and \"The American Times,\" for which see\r\n\"American Poetry,\" pp. 78-83.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRead Freneau's more jovial war satires in comparison with Whittier's\r\n\"Letter from a Missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church\" (\"American\r\nPoetry,\" p. 255); John R. Thompson's \"On to Richmond\" (\"American\r\nPoetry,\" p. 325); Edmund C. Stedman's \"How Old Brown took Harper's\r\nFerry\" (\"American Poetry,\" p. 317); and Lowell's \"Biglow Papers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRead Freneau's \"Pictures of Columbus\" in comparison with Lowell's\r\n\"Columbus\" (\"American Poetry,\" p. 382); Lanier's \"Sonnets on Columbus\"\r\n(\"American Poetry,\" p. 458); and Joaquin Miller's \"Columbus\" (\"American\r\nPoetry,\" p. 564).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Progress of Balloons\" derives its title from a whole series of\r\npreceding \"progress\" poems. Cite others and compare them as you can.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith reference to Freneau's diction in nature passages as compared with\r\nthat of Ames and Lewis in the text, read Wordsworth's essay on \"Poetic\r\nDiction\" prefatory to the lyrical ballads of 1798, with which Freneau\r\nagreed and which he anticipated in certain of his poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                            THE EARLY DRAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the growth of most national literatures the theater has developed\r\nside by side with the drama, the stage doing for the play what the\r\nprinting press did for the essay, poem, and novel. But in America,\r\nthe land of a transplanted civilization, the order was changed and\r\nthe first plays were supplied from abroad just as the other forms of\r\nliterature were. In the history of the American stage, therefore, the\r\nsuccessive steps were the presentation of English plays by American\r\namateurs in regular audience rooms with improvised stages; then the\r\ndevelopment of semiprofessional and wholly professional companies\r\nwho played short seasons at irregular intervals; then the erection\r\nof special playhouses; and finally the formation of more permanent\r\nprofessional companies, both English and American,--all of which took\r\nplace in the course of nearly two generations before the emergence of\r\nany native American drama. Recent investigations have so frequently\r\npushed back the years of first performances, playhouses, and plays that\r\nnow one can offer such dates only as subject to further revision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n          CHRONOLOGICAL CHART I.

Cullen Bryant                                           (1794->1878)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Cambridge History of American Literature,\" \"there\r\nseem to have been theatrical performances in this country since 1703.\"\r\nPaul Leicester Ford in his \"Washington and the Theater\" says, \"that\r\nthere was play-acting in New York, and in Charleston, South Carolina,\r\nbefore 1702, are unquestioned facts.\" In 1718 Governor Spottswood of\r\nVirginia gave an entertainment on the king's birthday, the feature of\r\nwhich was a play, probably acted by the students of William and Mary\r\nCollege, as there are references to later events of this sort. The\r\nVirginia governor's patronage bore different fruit from the early\r\nindorsement of playing in staid Massachusetts, for Samuel Sewall\r\nrecorded in his diary of March 2, 1714, a protest at the acting of a\r\nplay in the council chamber. \"Let not Christian Boston,\" he admonished,\r\n\"goe beyond Heathen Rome in the practice of Shamefull Vanities.\" On the\r\nother hand, Williamsburg, Virginia, had its own theater before 1720,\r\nNew York enjoyed professional acting and a playhouse by 1732, and in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, the use of the courtroom was frequent in\r\nthe two seasons before the opening of a theater in the winter of 1736.\r\nThese slight beginnings, with further undertakings in Philadelphia,\r\ndoubtless gave Lewis Hallam, the London actor, courage to venture\r\nover with his company in 1752. With his twelve players he brought a\r\nrepertory of twenty plays and eight farces, the majority of which had\r\nnever been presented in America; and since the year of their arrival\r\nthe American theater has had a consecutive and broadening place in the\r\nlife of the people.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of drama in America, to distinguish them from the\r\nearly life of the theater, are not quite clearly known. The first\r\nromantic drama, and the first play written by an American and\r\nproduced by a professional company, was Thomas Godfrey's \"The Prince\r\nof Parthia,\" completed by 1759 and acted in 1767 at the Southwark\r\nTheater, Philadelphia. The first drama on native American material--an\r\nunproduced problem play--was Robert Rogers's \"Ponteach,\" published\r\nin London in 1766. The first American comedy to be produced by a\r\nprofessional company was Royall Tyler's \"The Contrast,\" acted in 1787\r\nat the John Street Theater, New York. The first professional American\r\nplaywright was William Dunlap (1766-1839), author and producer, who\r\nwrote, adapted, and translated over sixty plays, operas, sketches,\r\nfarces, and interludes, of which at least fifty were produced and\r\nnearly thirty have been published. The first actor and playwright of\r\nmore than local prominence was John Howard Payne (1791-1852), more\r\noriginal than Dunlap and equally prolific, with one or two great\r\nsuccesses and eighteen published plays to his credit. The history\r\nof the American drama, as yet unwritten, will be a big work when it\r\nis fully done, for the output has been very large. Three hundred and\r\nseventy-eight plays are known to have been published by 1830 and\r\nnearly twice that number to have been played by 1860. In the remainder\r\nof this chapter, the aim of which is to induce study of plays within\r\nthe reach of the average college class, four dramas will be discussed\r\nbecause they are interesting in themselves and because they are early\r\nrepresentatives of types which still prevail.\r\n\r\nThe first is \"The Prince of Parthia,\" a romantic tragedy by Thomas\r\nGodfrey (1736-1763). He was the son of a scientist, a youth of cultured\r\ncompanions, West the painter and Hopkinson the poet-composer, and his\r\nalmost certain attendance at performances of the American company\r\nof actors led him, in addition to his juvenile poems, to make his\r\nambitious attempt at drama. \"The Prince of Parthia\" is evidently\r\nimitative, and yet no more so than most American poems, essays, novels,\r\nand plays written in the generation to which Godfrey belonged until\r\nhis early death at the age of twenty-seven. The Hallam and American\r\ncompanies had played more of Shakespeare than any other one thing,\r\nsomewhat of Beaumont and Fletcher, and more or less of Restoration\r\ndrama; and these combined influences appear in Godfrey's work. There\r\nare traces from \"Hamlet,\" signs of \"Macbeth,\" evidences of \"The Maid's\r\nTragedy,\" and responses to the Restoration interest in pseudo-oriental\r\nsubjects. Yet the play should not be dismissed with these comments\r\nas though they were a condemnation. What is more to the point is the\r\nfact that \"The Prince\" is very admirable as a piece of imitative\r\nwriting. The verse is fluent and at times stately. The construction\r\nas a whole is well considered. The characters are consistent, and\r\ntheir actions are based on sufficient motives. Many a later American\r\ndramatist fell far short of Godfrey both in excellence of style and in\r\nfirmness of structure and characterization. Had Godfrey lived and had\r\nhe passed out of his natural deference for models, he might have done\r\ndramatic writing quite equal to that of many a well-known successor.\r\nThe twentieth-century mind is unaccustomed to the \"tragedy of blood.\"\r\nA play with a king and two princely sons at once in love with the\r\nsame captive maiden, a jealous queen, a vengeful stepson, and a court\r\nfull of intriguing nobles, a story which ends with the accumulating\r\ndeaths of the six leading characters, hardly appeals to theatergoers\r\naccustomed to dramas which are more economical in their material. But\r\nGodfrey should be compared with his own contemporaries, and, all things\r\nconsidered, he stands the comparison well. The type of poetic drama\r\nhe attempted reoccurs later in the work of Robert Montgomery Bird,\r\nNathaniel Parker Willis, George Henry Boker, and Julia Ward Howe, and\r\nreappears in the present generation in plays by such men as Richard\r\nHovey and Percy Mackaye.\r\n\r\nThe second notable play was Robert Rogers's (1730?-1795) \"Ponteach: or\r\nthe Savages of America,\" published in London in 1766. The fact that\r\nit was not produced at the time must be laid to managerial timidity\r\nrather than to defects in the play, for it has some of the merits of\r\nGodfrey's work in the details and construction. Two reasons sufficient\r\nto put a cautious manager on guard were its criticism of the English\r\nand its treatment of the churchman. For the play as a whole is a\r\nsharp indictment of the white man's avarice in his transactions with\r\nthe Indians, in the course of which a Roman Catholic priest is by no\r\nmeans the least guilty. Traders, hunters, and governors combine in\r\nmalice and deceit, undermining the character of the Indians and at\r\nthe same time embittering them against their English conquerors. A\r\nplay with this burden, written so soon after the Seven Years' War,\r\nhad no more chance of being produced than a pacifist production did\r\nfrom 1914 to 1918. Godfrey's treatment of the Indians seems at first\r\nglance unconvincing, but this is chiefly because of the way he made\r\nthem talk. All the savages and all the different types of white rascal\r\nhold forth in the same elevated rhetorical discourse. This fact, which\r\nconstitutes a valid criticism, should be tempered by the recollection\r\nthat generations were yet to pass before anything lifelike was to be\r\nachieved in dialect writing. Cooper's Indians are quite as stately\r\nin speech as Rogers's. Yet, like Cooper, Rogers endowed them with\r\nnative dignity, self-control, tribal loyalty, and reverence for age\r\nas well as with treachery and the lust for blood. If \"Ponteach\" had\r\nbeen an indictment of the French instead of the English, it is a\r\nfair guess that American audiences would have seen it and greeted it\r\n\"with universal applause.\" As an Indian play it was followed by many\r\nsuccessors--Pocahontas alone was the theme of four plays between 1808\r\nand 1848. As a race play it broke the trail not only for these but for\r\nothers which branched off to the negro theme--from \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\r\nand \"The Octoroon,\" before the Civil War, to Sheldon's \"The Nigger,\" of\r\n1911. As a problem-purpose play it was the first American contribution\r\nto a long series which never flags entirely and which always multiplies\r\nin years when class or political feeling runs high.\r\n\r\nThe third notable American play--a success of 1787 and the first of\r\nmany successes in its field--was \"The Contrast,\" a comedy by Royall\r\nTyler (1757-1826). Its purport is indicated in the opening lines of the\r\nprologue:\r\n\r\n      Exult each patriot heart!--this night is shewn\r\n      A piece, which we may fairly call our own;\r\n      Where the proud titles of \"My Lord! Your Grace!\"\r\n      To humble Mr. and plain Sir give place.\r\n      Our Author pictures not from foreign climes\r\n      The fashions, or the follies of the times;\r\n      But has confin'd the subject of his work\r\n      To the gay scenes--the circles of New York.\r\n\r\nThere is a complacency of pioneership in this and a hint at servility\r\namong other playwrights which are not strictly justified by the facts,\r\nbut the prologue is none the less interesting for this. It is quite\r\nas true to its period as the content of the play is, for it displays\r\nthe independence of conscious revolt, exactly the note of Freneau's\r\n\"Literary Importation\" written only two years earlier (see p. 78) and\r\na constantly recurrent one in American literature for the next fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTyler's play is a comedy of manners setting forth \"the contrast between\r\na gentleman who has read Chesterfield and received the polish of Europe\r\nand an unpolished, untraveled American.\" This is reënforced by the\r\nantithesis between an unscrupulous coquette and a feminine model of all\r\nthe virtues, and between a popinjay servant and a crude countryman,\r\nthe original stage Yankee. As far as the moral is concerned the play\r\nmakes its point not because the good characters are admirable but\r\nbecause the bad ones are so vapid. Manly, the hero, is well disposed\r\nof by his frivolous sister's statement: \"His conversation is like\r\na rich, old-fashioned brocade, it will stand alone; every sentence\r\nis a sentiment\"; and Maria, the heroine, is revealed by her own\r\nobservation that \"the only safe asylum a woman of delicacy can find\r\nis in the arms of a man of honor.\" Yet the contrasts lead to good\r\ndramatic situations and to some amusing comedy, and the play is further\r\ninteresting because of the fund of allusion to what Tyler considered\r\nboth worthless and worthy English literary influences. The extended\r\nreference to \"The School for Scandal\" as seen at the theater by\r\nJonathan is acknowledgment enough of Tyler's debt to an English master.\r\n\"The Contrast\" is the voice of young America protesting its superiority\r\nto old England and old Europe. It had been audible before the date of\r\nTyler's play, and it was to be heard again and again for the better\r\npart of a century and in all forms of literature. In drama the most\r\nfamous play of the type in the next two generations was Anna C. O.\r\nMowatt's \"Fashion\" of 1845. \"Contrast\" was furthermore a forerunner\r\nof many later plays which were descriptive without being satirical,\r\na large number of which carried New York in their titles as well as\r\nin their contents. These doubtless looked back quite directly to the\r\nrepeated successes of Pierce Egan's \"Life in London,\" but they had all\r\nto acknowledge that Tyler was the early and conspicuous playwright who\r\nhad\r\n\r\n                confin'd the subject of his work\r\n      To the gay scenes--the circles of New York.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last play for any detailed comment here is \"André\"\r\n(1798) by William Dunlap (1766-1839). Dunlap asked for recognition, as\r\nTyler had done, on nationalistic grounds,\r\n\r\n      A Native Bard, a native scene displays,\r\n      And claims your candour for his daring lays;\r\n\r\nand he took heed, as Rogers seems not to have done, of the risk he was\r\nrunning in entering the perilous straits of political controversy in\r\nwhich \"Ponteach\" was stranded before it had reached the theater:\r\n\r\n      O, may no party spirit blast his views,\r\n      Or turn to ill the meanings of the Muse;\r\n      She sings of wrongs long past, Men as they were,\r\n      To instruct, without reproach, the Men that are;\r\n      Then judge the Story by the genius shown,\r\n      And praise, or damn it, for its worth alone.\r\n\r\nParty feeling was high at the time over the opposing claims of France\r\nand England--\"The Rival Suitors for America,\" as Freneau called them\r\nin his verses of 1795. \"Hail Columbia,\" by Joseph Hopkinson, made an\r\nimmediate hit when sung at an actors' benefit less than four weeks\r\nafter the production of \"André,\" and made it by an appeal to broad\r\nnational feeling. And Dunlap, after a slip of sentiment in the first\r\nperformance, kept clear of politics, and showed tact as well as daring\r\nby making the Briton heroic, though a spy, and by his fine treatment\r\nof the unnamed \"General,\" who was evidently Washington. Dunlap's play\r\nshowed a ready appreciation of theatrical effectiveness. It was the\r\nwork of a playmaker rather than a poet, and the verse had none of\r\nthe elevation of Godfrey's or Rogers's. It was far better than the\r\ndeclamatory stage efforts of the Revolutionary years by Brackenridge,\r\nLeacock, Low, and Mercy Warren, and it was the best early specimen of\r\nthe historical romance for which there is always a ready patronage.\r\n\r\nDunlap is more significant as an all-round man in the early history\r\nof the American theater than as a pure dramatist. He was a good judge\r\nof what the public wanted, and fairly able to achieve it. What he\r\ncould not write he could translate or adapt. He turned Schiller's \"Don\r\nCarlos\" into English, and it failed; but he made a great success of\r\nZschokke's \"Abaellino\" and translated no less than thirteen plays of\r\nKotzebue. A comic opera, a dramatic satire, a farce, or an interlude\r\nseemed all one to him in point of ease or difficulty. From 1796 to 1803\r\nhe produced more than four plays a year under his own management at the\r\nPark Theater in New York. He continued as a manager till 1805 and was\r\nconnected with the theater again in 1810-1811. Finally, to cap all, in\r\n1832 he published in two volumes his \"History of the American Theater,\"\r\nwhich, though inaccurate in many details, is full of the personal\r\nrecollections of men and events that no amount of exact scholarship\r\ncould now unearth.\r\n\r\nThe really auspicious beginnings in American play-writing up to 1800\r\nwere hardly followed up in the period before the interruption of\r\nthe drama by the Civil War. One man stands out, John Howard Payne\r\n(1791-1852). Starting as a precocious boy actor and a dramatist whose\r\nfirst play was staged at the age of fifteen, he developed into a\r\nreputation greater than that of Dunlap, but in the perspective of time\r\nlittle more enduring. His \"Brutus\" was played for years by well-known\r\ntragedians, and his \"Charles II,\" in which Washington Irving had a\r\nhand, was long successful as a comedy. But he was too prolific for\r\nhigh excellence, and he did nothing new. Now and then men who wrote\r\nabundantly produced single plays of rather high merit though of\r\nimitative quality, such as Robert Montgomery Bird's \"Broker of Bogota.\"\r\nThere was a generous output, but a low level of production; tragedies,\r\nhistorical plays, comedies of manners, local dramas, social satires,\r\nmelodramas, and farces followed in steady flow. Successful novels of\r\nCooper, Simms, Mrs. Stowe, and writers of lesser note were quickly\r\nstaged, but no one of undoubted distinction came to the fore. Writers\r\nin other fields, like Nathaniel Parker Willis, the essayist, George\r\nHenry Boker, the poet, and Julia Ward Howe, turned their hands at times\r\nto play-writing with moderate success. But it is significant that the\r\nconspicuous names of the period were names of actors and producers\r\nrather than of playwrights. The history of the American stage has been\r\nunbroken up to the present time, but it was not until near the end of\r\nthe century that the literary material presented on the stage became\r\nmore than a vehicle for the enterprise of managers and the talents\r\nof actors. This later stage will be briefly discussed in one of the\r\nclosing chapters of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  CRAWFORD, M. C.

His\r\nshort life, from 1771 to 1810, was almost exactly contemporary with\r\nthe productive middle half of Freneau's long career. That he earned\r\nhis living by his pen is a matter of incidental interest in American\r\nliterary history; the more important facts are that he looms large in\r\nthe chronicles of the American novel and that he was a factor in the\r\ndevelopment of the American periodical.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Philadelphia. \"His parents,\" says Dunlap, whose whole\r\nbiography is written with the same labored elevation, \"were virtuous,\r\nreligious people, and as such held a respectable rank in society; and\r\nhe could trace back a long line of ancestry holding the same honorable\r\nstation.\" He was a delicate, precocious child, and under the prevalent\r\nforcing process of the day was cultivated into an infant prodigy. By\r\nthe time that he was sixteen he was well schooled in the classics; he\r\nhad versified parts of Job, the Psalms, and Ossian; he had sketched\r\nplans for three epic poems; and he had permanently undermined his\r\nhealth. At eighteen he was studying law, indulging in debate and in\r\nphilosophical speculation, and was the author of his first published\r\nmagazine article. In the next few years--the dates are not exactly\r\nrecorded--he abandoned the law; at one time gave thanks that because\r\nof his feeble health he was free from the ordinary temptations of\r\nyouth, and at another, for the same reason, contemplated suicide;\r\nand finally, to escape the urgent counsels of his advisers, he left\r\nhis home city for New York. Here he fell in with congenial literary\r\ncompanions, joined the Friendly Club, in which among other benefits\r\nhe was the recipient of friendly criticism for his \"disputatiousness\r\nand dogmatism,\" and in the stirring period of the '90's began to dream\r\nUtopian dreams of a new heaven on the old earth.\r\n\r\nHis active authorship, which began with 1797, was varied and incessant.\r\nIt included between then and 1810 a large number of magazine\r\ncontributions (many of them serials), six novels (all published between\r\n1798 and 1801), several other volumes more or less in the nature of\r\nhack work, and nine years of periodical editorship. He wrote with the\r\nconfidence of youth for a youthful and uncritical reading public, with\r\nthe natural result that his output was more bulky than distinguished.\r\nHe was immensely communicative: filled with \"the rapture with which he\r\nheld communion with his own thoughts\"--committing them to paper in a\r\ncopious journal, in circumstantial letters, and in the rivulet which\r\nflowed from his pen into the forgotten gulf of magazinedom. In 1799 he\r\nwas working on five different novels, although from April until the\r\nend of the next year he was editing _The Monthly Magazine and American\r\nReview_. Before he was thirty his reputation was established and his\r\nimportant work was done. In 1801 he returned to Philadelphia with\r\nachieved success as a reply to the friends who had tried to dissuade\r\nhim from professional writing. There he undertook in 1803 another\r\neditorial venture in _The Literary Magazine and American Register_.\r\nFrom the excited young radical of a half-dozen years earlier, disciple\r\nof William Godwin, he had become by some reaction a fulfiller of his\r\npious ancestry. In his statement of principles he made it clear that\r\nhe would rather be respectable than disturbing in his sentiments. He\r\nreferred to the recent bold attacks on \"the foundations of religion\r\nand morality,\" declared that he would conserve these and proscribe\r\neverything that offended against them, and concluded (using the\r\neditorial third person): \"His poetical pieces may be dull, but they at\r\nleast shall be free from voluptuousness or sensuality; and his prose,\r\nwhether seconded or not by genius and knowledge, shall scrupulously\r\naim at the promotion of public and private virtue.\" Even under the\r\nweight of this unmitigated morality the magazine was continued for\r\nfour years. Brown had, however, stepped down from the level of an\r\nauthor who was in any degree creative to a platform for dispensing\r\ncommonplace conservatism and useful knowledge. The decline is further\r\nproven by the nature of his last industrious ventures: \"The American\r\nRegister, or General Repository of History, Politics and Science\"\r\n(Philadelphia, 1807-1811, seven vols.) and a prospectus in 1809 of an\r\nunfinished \"System of General Geography; containing a Topographical,\r\nStatistical and Descriptive Survey of the Earth.\" With the handicap\r\nof his early impaired health and under the burden of his self-imposed\r\nschedule his strength failed him, and he died in 1810, an overworked\r\nconsumptive. It is quite evident, however, that his distinctive work\r\nwas done. If old age had been granted him, unless some amazing reversal\r\nof form had taken place, it would have been a long, industrious, and\r\nultraconventional anticlimax to the rather brilliant promise of his\r\nyoung manhood.\r\n\r\nIn entering the field of fiction-writing Brown took his place in the\r\nnewest literary movement in America. For nearly two centuries, as the\r\npreceding chapters have shown, poetry and expository prose had been\r\nthe only accepted forms. Some years after the beginnings of a native\r\ntheater in the middle of the eighteenth century the first attempts\r\nwere made in a native drama, but they were faint and scant and were\r\nlooked on with indifference, if not with disapproval, by most of the\r\ncountry. The chief tide of composition after the war for independence\r\nwas controlled by the twin moons of Pope and Addison. The triumph of\r\nthe English novel had occurred in the twenty-five years after the death\r\nof Pope, however, and its influence could not be long unfelt. In fact\r\nthe six years of controversy which led to the dismissal of Jonathan\r\nEdwards from his Northampton church in 1750 (see p. 43) suggest\r\nthat Richardson achieved a furtive reading almost at once; for it\r\nwas Edwards's protest against certain books which led to \"lascivious\r\nand obscene discourse\" among the young people that started the whole\r\ntrouble--and \"Pamela\" was the sensation of the day. A later disapproval\r\nof Richardson was based merely on his encouragement of frivolity. Says\r\nTrumbull of Harriet Simper, in \"The Progress of Dulness\" of 1773:\r\n\r\n      Thus Harriet reads, and reading really\r\n      Believes herself a young Pamela,\r\n      The high-wrought whim, the tender strain\r\n      Elate her mind and turn her brain:\r\n      Before her glass, with smiling grace,\r\n      She views the wonders of her face;\r\n      There stands in admiration moveless,\r\n      And hopes a Grandison, or Lovelace.\r\n\r\nAnd by 1804 so strait a conservative as President Dwight of Yale could\r\nrefer with complacency to novelists in general, and to Sterne in\r\nparticular: \"Our progress resembled not a little that of my Uncle Toby;\r\nfor we could hardly be said to advance at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest American novels were tentative beginnings of several\r\nsorts. The first was \"The Power of Sympathy,\" by a Lady of Boston\r\n(Mrs. Sarah Wentworth Morton), in 1789. It was soon overshadowed\r\nby Susanna Rowson's extremely popular \"Charlotte\" in 1790. Both\r\nwere highly-seasoned love stories. Of a different kind was H. H.\r\nBrackenridge's \"Modern Chivalry\" (1792-1793-1797), a rollicking satire\r\non democracy carried on a narrative thread, with about the same right\r\nto be termed a novel as Pierce Egan's \"Life in London\" of a generation\r\nlater. Different again was G. Imlay's \"The Emigrants\" (1793), a tale\r\nof the West with a conventional London plot and set of characters. And\r\ndifferent again was Royall Tyler's \"The Algerine Captive\" (1797), a\r\ncontemporary story combining social satire, travel, and international\r\npolitics, with significant witness in the preface to the growing\r\nAmerican vogue of the novel.\r\n\r\nWhen Brown came to the point of telling his own stories, however,\r\nhe did not follow in the footsteps of any American predecessors,\r\nbut turned to a type for which he was especially fitted--the Gothic\r\nromance. This was the first extravagant contribution of fiction to\r\nthe Romantic movement,--the tale of wonder and horror, of alternating\r\nmoonlit serenities and midnight storms, of haunted castles and secret\r\nchambers, of woods and vales and caves and precipices, of apparent\r\nsupernaturalism which was explained away in a conscientious anticlimax,\r\nand of the same seraphic heroine and diabolical villain who had played\r\nthe leading roles for Richardson. It had been developed by Horace\r\nWalpole and Mrs. Anne Radcliffe and \"Monk\" Lewis and finally by William\r\nGodwin, who combined all this machinery into a kind of literary \"tank\"\r\nfor the conveyance of a didactic gun crew, for his \"Caleb Williams\" was\r\nin fact little more than \"Political Justice\" in narrative camouflage.\r\nThis was a formula exactly to Brown's taste, since he had both a\r\nstrong ethical bias and a liking for the mysterious. His particular\r\nundertaking was to translate it into American terms, a task that he\r\ncarried through in his extraordinary output of 1798 to 1801.\r\n\r\nThe first to be published was \"Wieland,\" a gradually increasing\r\nsuccession of horrors which are brought about through the influence\r\nof a mysterious voice. By the oracular commands of the unseen speaker\r\nWieland's double tendency to superstition and melancholy is deepened\r\ninto a calm and steady fanaticism. At the end, in obedience to what\r\nhe thinks is the voice of God, he murders his wife and children and,\r\nconfessing, is acquitted on grounds of insanity. The horrid chapter of\r\nmishaps is explained by the repentant villain, Carwin, a ventriloquist,\r\nwho accounts for the stupendous wickedness of his achievement by\r\nnothing more convincing than an irresistible inclination to practice\r\nhis talent. \"Ormond,\" of the next year, is a story of feminine virtue\r\ntriumphant over obstacles, which is complicated by the employment of\r\ntwo heroines, two victimized fathers, and two villains. The element\r\nof horror is supplied in the background of the yellow-fever plague;\r\nand the mystery, by the apparent omniscience of the worse of the\r\nmalefactors, who is simply an ingenious resorter to false doors and\r\nsecret partitions.\r\n\r\nBrown's most ambitious novel was \"Arthur Mervyn,\" which appeared in\r\ntwo volumes in 1799 and 1800. It carries as a subtitle \"The Memoirs\r\nof 1793.\" These days, according to the preface, were suggestive to\r\n\"the moral observer, to whom they have furnished new displays of the\r\ninfluence of human passions and motives.\" He has used \"such incidents\r\nas appeared to him most instructive and remarkable,\" believing that\r\n\"it is every one's duty to profit by all opportunities of inculcating\r\nupon mankind the lessons of justice and humanity.\" He believes in\r\ntragic realism on account of the \"pity\" which it may inspire. As a\r\nmatter of fact the plague seems rather incidental than integral to the\r\nstory. It gives rise to the introduction of Arthur Mervyn on the scene\r\nand to the long piece of retrospective narrative which occupies all\r\nof the first volume. This tells of the experiences of Arthur, three\r\ndays long, with a consummate villain, Welbeck, just as the sins of the\r\nlatter return to him in a dozen ways. The second volume pursues certain\r\nunfinished stories begun in the first, the general motives being to\r\nshow how completely the innocent Arthur Mervyn is misunderstood and to\r\npresent his efforts to atone in some degree for the offenses of the\r\nreal sinner. The structure is by no means as firm even as this analysis\r\nwould seem to indicate. It is an endless ramification of stories within\r\nstories, and stops at last without any sufficient conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur Mervyn\" is evidently indebted to William Godwin, of whose\r\n\"transcendent powers\" in \"Caleb Williams\" Brown was an ardent admirer.\r\nBut it as hard for the modern reader to see why either book is\r\nstrikingly individual. Godwin's feelings about the travesties on\r\njustice indulged in by the English courts had been anticipated by\r\nSmollett in \"Roderick Random\" (chap. lxi ff.); and Caleb's hard times\r\nas a fugitive from a false charge are very similar to Roderick's. In\r\nthe light of history it seems apparent that Brown was impressed by\r\nthe book because it was widely popular when he was writing, and that\r\nits popularity was due not so much to its merits as to its political\r\ntimeliness at a moment of revolutionary excitement. Of Brown's three\r\nremaining novels only one, \"Edgar Huntly,\" is of any importance.\r\nThis is a good detective story, fresher than any of his others. A\r\nsomnambulist who murders while walking in his sleep supplies the\r\nhorror and creates the mystery; and certain pictures of frontier life\r\nand Allegheny Mountain scenery, with an Indian massacre and a panther\r\nfight, are effectively homemade.\r\n\r\nBrown's novels should naturally be estimated in comparison with the\r\nworks of his contemporaries rather than with the crisp and clean-cut\r\nnarrative of the present, but even so they are burdened with very\r\nevident defects. The most flagrant of these are the natural fruits\r\nof hasty writing. He is quoted as saying to one of his friends,\r\n\"Sir, good pens, thick paper, and ink well diluted, would facilitate\r\nmy composition more than the prospect of the broadest expanse of\r\nclouds, water or mountains rising above the clouds.\" This suggests\r\nthe steady craftsmanship of Anthony Trollope with his thousand words\r\nan hour. Yet he was in no respect of style or construction the equal\r\nof Trollope. His novels are full of loose ends and inconsequences. He\r\nis unblushing in his reliance on \"the long arm of coincidence.\" Even\r\nwhen one untangles the plots from the maze of circumstance in which\r\nhe involves them, they are unconvincing because they are so deficient\r\nin human motive. Moreover, in style they are expressed in language\r\nwhich is dizzily exalted even for the formal period in which they were\r\nwritten. \"I proceeded to the bath, and filling the reservoir with\r\nwater, speedily dissipated the heat that incommoded me.\" \"I had been\r\na stranger to what is called love. From subsequent reflection I have\r\ncontracted a suspicion that the sentiment with which I regarded the\r\nlady was not untinctured from this source and that hence arose the\r\nturbulence of my feelings.\"\r\n\r\nAs he never wrote--never had time to write--with painstaking care, his\r\nbest passages are those which he set down with passionate rapidity.\r\nWhen the subject in hand rapt him clean out of himself so that he\r\nbecame part of the story, he could transmit his thrill to the reader.\r\nThe horrors of a plague-stricken city such as he had survived in New\r\nYork made him forget to be \"literary.\" And the tense excitement of\r\nan actor in moments of suspense he could recreate in himself and on\r\npaper. His gifts, therefore, were such as to strengthen the climaxes of\r\nhis stories and to emphasize the flatness of the long levels between.\r\nHe had the weakness of a dramatist who could write nothing but \"big\r\nscenes,\" but his big scenes were thrillers of the first magnitude.\r\nHe was a journalist with a ready pen; his best work was done in the\r\nmood and manner of a gifted reporter. He had neither the constructive\r\nimagination nor the scrupulous regard for details of the creative\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nAlthough in his Gothic tales Brown was a pioneer among American\r\nnovelists, he was like many another American of early days in trailing\r\nalong after a declining English fashion. By 1800 the great day of the\r\nGothic romance was over. Within a few years it was to become a literary\r\noddity. Scott was to continue in what he called the \"big bow-wow\"\r\nstrain but was to make his romances rational and human, and Jane Austen\r\nwas to describe the feelings and characters of ordinary life with the\r\nhearty contempt for the extravagances of the Radcliffe school which\r\nshe expressed throughout \"Northanger Abbey\" (chaps. 1, xx ff.). Yet in\r\nhis own period Brown was recognized in England as well as in America.\r\nThe best reviews took him seriously, Godwin owed a return influence\r\nfrom him, Shelley read him with absorbed attention, Scott borrowed the\r\nnames of two of his characters. In these facts there is evidence that\r\nhe was American not only in his acceptance of foreign influence but in\r\nhis conversion of what he received into a product that was truly his\r\nown and truly American. There are more or less distinct hints of Cooper\r\nand Poe and Hawthorne in the material and the temper of his writings,\r\nand there is more than a hint of Mrs. Stowe and Lew Wallace and the\r\nmodern purpose-novelists in the grave intention to inculcate \"upon\r\nmankind the lessons of justice and morality\" with which he undertook\r\nhis labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  CROSS, W.

This is not to say that what they wrote was utterly and\r\ndramatically different from what had been written in the colonial\r\nperiod; yet there are many points of clear distinction to be marked.\r\nWith them, for one thing, New York City first assumed the literary\r\nleadership of the country. It was not a permanent conquest, but it was\r\nnotable as marking the fact that the new country had a dominating city.\r\nAs a rule the intellectual and artistic life of a country centers about\r\nits capital. Athens, Rome, Paris, London, are places through which\r\nthe voices of Greece, Italy, France, and England have uttered their\r\nmessages. These cities have held their preëminence, moreover, because,\r\nin addition to being the seats of government, they have been the great\r\ncommercial centers and usually the great ports of their countries.\r\nIn the United States, then, the final adoption of Washington in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia as the national capital was a compromise step;\r\nthis could not result in bringing to it the additional distinction\r\nwhich natural conditions gave to New York. Washington has never been\r\nmore than the city where the national business of government is carried\r\non; locating the center for art and literature has been beyond the\r\ncontrol of legislative action. For the first third of the nineteenth\r\ncentury New York was the favored city. Here Irving was born, and here\r\nCooper and Bryant came as young men, rather than to the Philadelphia of\r\nFranklin and his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nFor these men of New York, America was an accomplished fact--a nation\r\nslowly and awkwardly taking its place among the nations of the world.\r\nTo be sure, the place that Americans wanted to take, following the\r\nadvice of George Washington, was one of withdrawal from the turmoil of\r\nthe Old World and of safety from \"entangling alliances\" which could\r\never again bring it into the warfare from which it was so glad to be\r\nescaping. The Atlantic was immensely broader in those days than now,\r\nfor its real breadth is to be measured not in miles but in the number\r\nof days that it takes to cross it. When Irving went abroad for the\r\nfirst time in 1803 he was fifty-nine days in passage. To-day one can\r\ngo round the world in considerably less time, and the average fast\r\nAtlantic steamship passage is one tenth of that, while the aëroplane\r\nflight has divided the time by ten again. So the early Americans\r\nrejoiced in their \"magnificent isolation\" and wanted to grow up as\r\ndignified, respected, but very distant neighbors of the Old World.\r\n\r\nIt was an unhappy fact, however, that America--or the United\r\nStates--was not notable for its dignity in the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century; for the finest dignity, like charity, \"is not\r\npuffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly,\" whereas the new nation\r\nwas very self-conscious; quickly irritated at foreign criticism,\r\nand uncomfortably aware of its own crudities in manner and defects\r\nin character. As far as foreign criticism was concerned, there were\r\nample reasons for annoyance in America. Even as early as 1775 John\r\nTrumbull[4] had felt that it was hopeless to expect fair treatment at\r\nthe hands of English reviewers, warning his friends Dwight and Barlow,\r\n\r\n        Such men to charm could Homer's muse avail,\r\n      Who read to cavil, and who write to rail;\r\n      When ardent genius pours the bold sublime,\r\n      Carp at the style, or nibble at the rhyme;\r\n\r\nand the mother country, after the Revolution and the War of 1812, was\r\nless inclined than before to deal in compliment. Man after man came\r\nover,\r\n\r\n        Like Fearon, Ashe, and others we could mention;\r\n      Who paid us friendly visits to abuse\r\n      Our country, and find food for the reviews.[5]\r\n\r\n  [4] Lines addressed to Messrs. Dwight and Barlow.\r\n\r\n  [5] Fitzgreene Halleck, \"Fanny,\" stanza lviii.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all the time that England was criticizing her runaway child,\r\nshe was maddeningly complacent as to her own virtues. Americans could\r\nnot strike back with any effect, because they could not make the\r\nEnglish feel their blows. So they fretted and fumed for half a century,\r\ntheir discomfort finding its clearest expression in Lowell's lines[6]:\r\n\r\n      She _is_ some punkins, thet I wun't deny\r\n      (For ain't she some related to you 'n' I?)\r\n      But there's a few small intrists here below\r\n      Outside the counter o' John Bull an' Co,\r\n      An' though they can't conceit how't should be so,\r\n      I guess the Lord druv down Creation's spiles\r\n      'thout no _gret_ helpin' from the British Isles,\r\n      An' could contrive to keep things pooty stiff\r\n      Ef they withdrawed from business in a miff;\r\n      I ha'n't no patience with sech swellin' fellers ez\r\n      Think God can't forge 'thout them to blow the bellerses.\r\n\r\n  [6] Mason and Slidell, ll. 155-165.\r\n\r\nA further reason for uneasiness in the face of foreign comment was\r\nthat honest Americans were aware that their country suffered from the\r\ncrudities of youth. It is unpleasant enough for \"Seventeen\" to be\r\nnagged by an unsympathetic maiden aunt, but it is intolerable if she\r\nhas some ground for her naggings. In small matters as well as great\r\n\"conscience doth make cowards of us all.\" In a period of such rapid\r\nexpansion as prevailed in the young manhood of Irving, Cooper, and\r\nBryant it was unavoidable that most of the population were drawn into\r\nbusiness undertakings that were usually eager and hurried and that were\r\noften slipshod or even shady. The American colleges and their graduates\r\nwere not as distinguished as they had been in the earlier colonial\r\ndays, and the new influence of European culture from the Old World\r\nuniversities was yet to come. In the cities, and notably in New York,\r\nthe vulgar possessors of mushroom fortunes multiplied rapidly, bringing\r\nup vapid daughters like Halleck's \"Fanny,\"[7] who in all the modern\r\nlanguages was\r\n\r\n        Exceedingly well-versed; and had devoted\r\n      To their attainment, far more time than has,\r\n        By the best teachers, lately been allotted;\r\n      For she had taken lessons, twice a week,\r\n      For a full month in each; and she could speak\r\n\r\n      French and Italian, equally as well\r\n        As Chinese, Portuguese, or German; and,\r\n      What is still more surprising, she could spell\r\n        Most of our longest English words off-hand;\r\n      Was quite familiar in Low Dutch and Spanish,\r\n      And thought of studying modern Greek and Danish;\r\n\r\nand whose father, a man of newly affected silence that spoke\r\n\"unutterable things,\" was established in a mortgaged house filled\r\nwith servants and \"whatever is necessary for a 'genteel liver'\" and\r\nbuttressed with a coach and half a dozen unpaid-for horses. At the\r\nsame time the countryside was developing a native but not altogether\r\nadmirable Yankee type. At their best, Halleck[8] wrote,\r\n\r\n                      The people of today\r\n      Appear good, honest, quiet men enough\r\n        And hospitable too--for ready pay;\r\n      With manners like their roads, a little rough,\r\n      And hands whose grasp is warm and welcoming, though tough.\r\n\r\n  [7] \"Fanny,\" stanzas cxxi, cxxii.\r\n\r\n  [8] \"Wyoming,\" stanza iv.\r\n\r\nAnd at their worst Whittier[9] looked back a half century, to 1818, and\r\nrecalled them as\r\n\r\n      Shrill, querulous women, sour and sullen men,\r\n      Untidy, loveless, old before their time,\r\n      With scarce a human interest save their own\r\n      Monotonous round of small economies,\r\n      Or the poor scandal of the neighborhood;\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Church-goers, fearful of the unseen Powers,\r\n      But grumbling over pulpit tax and pew-rent,\r\n      Saving, as shrewd economists, their souls\r\n      And winter pork, with the least possible outlay\r\n      Of salt and sanctity; in daily life\r\n      Showing as little actual comprehension\r\n      Of Christian charity and love and duty\r\n      As if the Sermon on the Mount had been\r\n      Outdated like a last year's almanac.\r\n\r\nA natural consequence of such criticism from without, and such raw and\r\ndefective culture within the country, was that American writers of any\r\nmoment bided their time as patiently as they could, recognizing that\r\nfor the moment America must be a nation of workers who were\r\n\r\n          rearing the pedestal, broad-based and grand,\r\n      Whereon the fair shapes of the Artist shall stand,\r\n      And creating, through labors undaunted and long,\r\n      The theme for all Sculpture and Painting and Song.[10]\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth noting that the first three eminent writers in\r\nnineteenth-century America were themselves not university products.\r\nBryant withdrew from Williams College at the end of the first year,\r\nand Cooper from Yale toward the end of the second. The real education\r\nof these two and of Irving, who did not even enter college, was in the\r\nworld of action rather than in the world of books, and their associates\r\nwere for the most part men of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [9] \"Among the Hills\" (Prelude, 71 ff.).\r\n\r\n  [10] Lowell, \"Fable for Critics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WASHINGTON IRVING\r\n\r\nMany of the facts about the boyhood and youth of Washington Irving\r\n(1783-1859) are typical of his place and his period as well as true\r\nof himself. The first is that he was born (in New York City) of\r\nBritish-American parents, his father a Scotch Presbyterian from the\r\nOrkney Islands and his mother an Englishwoman. His father's rigid\r\nreligious views dominated in the upbringing of himself and his six\r\nbrothers and sisters. Two nearly inevitable results followed: one, that\r\nas a boy he grew to believe that almost everything that was enjoyable\r\nwas wicked, and the other, that as he came toward manhood he was\r\nparticularly fond of the pleasures of life. A boy of his capacities in\r\nBoston at this time would have been more than likely to go to Harvard\r\nCollege, which was a dominating influence in eastern Massachusetts,\r\nbut King's College (Columbia) occupied no such position in New York.\r\nIrving's higher education began in a law office, and then, when his\r\nhealth seemed to be failing, was continued by travel abroad. The long\r\njourney, or series of journeys, that he took from 1804 to 1806 were\r\nof the greatest importance. They were important to Irving because he\r\nwas peculiarly fitted to get the greatest good from such informal\r\neducation. He was an attractive young fellow, so that it was easy for\r\nhim to make and to hold friends; and he was blessed with his father's\r\nmoral balance, so that he did not fall into bad habits. He was so far\r\ninclined to laziness that it is doubtful if he would have achieved much\r\nif he had gone to college, but he was wide-awake and receptive, so that\r\nhe absorbed information wherever he went. Furthermore, he had a mind as\r\nwell as a memory, and he came back to America stocked not merely with\r\na great lot of miscellaneous facts but with a real knowledge of human\r\nnature and of human life.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of his return to New York in 1806 to the day of his death,\r\nin 1859, Washington Irving had an international point of view and\r\ndeveloped steadily into an international character. His first piece\r\nof writing was that of a very young man, but a young man of promise.\r\nLike the other Americans of his day he had read a good deal of English\r\nliterature written in the eighteenth century; and among the essayists\r\nof that century who had attracted his attention one was Oliver\r\nGoldsmith. New York supplied him with his subjects and Goldsmith with\r\nhis method of attack, for he wrote, in company with one of his brothers\r\nand a mutual friend, a series of amusing criticisms on the ways of his\r\ntownsmen, modeling his _Salmagundi Papers_ after Goldsmith's _Citizen\r\nof the World_. This was at once independent and imitative. The youthful\r\nauthors blithely announced in their introductory number that they\r\nproposed to \"instruct the young, reform the old, correct the town, and\r\ncastigate the age.\" In the twenty-two papers that came out at irregular\r\nintervals between January, 1807, and January, 1808, they criticized\r\neverything that struck their attention, and they had their eyes wide\r\nopen. The American love of display, the inclination to indulge in\r\nfruitless discussion which made the country a \"logocracy\" rather than\r\na democracy, the lack of both judgment and order which marked their\r\npolitical elections, and their social and literary fashions make just\r\na beginning of the list of subjects held up to genial ridicule. Yet,\r\nthough the criticism was fair and to the point, it was an old-fashioned\r\nkind of comment, the kind that England had been feeding on for the\r\nbetter part of a century, ever since Addison and Steele had made it\r\npopular in the _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_. Moreover, it was done in\r\nan old-fashioned way, for in making Mustapha Rub-a-Dub Keli Khan, the\r\nTripolitan, the foreign commentator on American life as he saw it with\r\na stranger's eyes, they were using a device that was old even before\r\nit was employed by the Englishman from whom they borrowed it. The\r\n_Salmagundis_ are interesting, however, as early representatives of a\r\nlongish succession of satires on the life of New York, all pleasant\r\nand rather pleasantly superficial. Three years later Irving, this time\r\nalone, followed up this initial success with his \"Knickerbocker's\r\nHistory of New York,\" not as serious a piece of work as its title at\r\nfirst suggests, for it was a burlesque of a heavy and pretentious\r\nhistory on the same subject which had appeared just before. Like the\r\n_Salmagundis_ it was vivacious and impertinent, the very clever work of\r\na very young man.\r\n\r\nNow for ten years Washington Irving produced nothing as a writer. He\r\nwas engaged in business with his brothers, and proved himself the most\r\nlevel-headed member of a pretty unbusinesslike combination. In 1815, in\r\nconnection with one of their many ambitious and unsuccessful schemes,\r\nhe went abroad, probably without the least suspicion that he would\r\nbe absent from his own country for seventeen years and that he would\r\nreturn to it as a celebrated writer widely read in two continents.\r\nThe first step toward his wider reputation came in 1819 with the\r\npublication in London of \"The Sketch Book,\" the best known of all his\r\nworks. This was followed in 1822 by \"Bracebridge Hall\" and in 1824\r\nby \"Tales of a Traveller,\" both similar in tone and contents to \"The\r\nSketch Book.\" With a reputation as a graceful writer of sketches and\r\nstories now thoroughly established, he turned to a more substantial\r\nand ambitious form of work in the composition of \"The History of the\r\nLife and Voyages of Christopher Columbus,\" living and writing in\r\nMadrid for the two years before its publication in 1828; and this book\r\nhe followed quickly, as in the case of \"The Sketch Book,\" with two\r\nother productions of the same kind--\"The Conquest of Granada\" in 1829\r\nand \"The Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of Columbus\" in\r\n1831. For three years before his return to America, Irving served as\r\nSecretary of Legation to the court of St. James, London, and then came\r\nback to enjoy at home a popularity which had been almost wholly earned\r\nabroad. Out of his career thus far four main facts deserve attention.\r\nFirst, that his literary work began with two pieces of social satire,\r\nwritten in a boyish, jovial manner which he largely abandoned in later\r\nyears; second, that his fame was established on works of \"The Sketch\r\nBook\" type, made up of short units, gracefully written, and full\r\nof quiet humor and tender sentiment (now and again he continued in\r\nthis sort of composition up to the end of his life); third, that in\r\nhis maturer years he resorted to the writing of formal history, and\r\nthat he followed the first three studies, done in Spain, with \"Oliver\r\nGoldsmith\" in 1849, \"Mahomet and his Successors\" in 1850, and \"The Life\r\nof Washington,\" completed in 1859, the year of his death. To these\r\nliterary facts should be added a fourth which is both literary and\r\npolitical and of no small significance in history--the fact of Irving's\r\nappointment to a post in the foreign diplomatic service. This was to\r\nbe followed in his own life by his four years as Minister to Spain in\r\n1842-1846, under President Harrison, and in the next fifty years by a\r\ndistinguished list of other appointments to the consular and diplomatic\r\nstaffs. No single group has done more to bring honor to the United\r\nStates in the courts of Europe during the nineteenth century than\r\nwriters like Irving, Hawthorne, Motley, Howells, Bayard Taylor, Lowell,\r\nHay, and their successors down to Thomas Nelson Page and Brand Whitlock.\r\n\r\nTo return to \"The Sketch Book.\" By 1818, three years after Irving had\r\ngone abroad for the second time, the business in which he had been\r\nengaged with his brothers had utterly failed, and he was forced to\r\nregard writing not merely as an attractive way of diverting himself but\r\nas a possible source of income. The new articles which he then wrote,\r\ntogether with many which had been accumulating in the leisure of his\r\nyears in England, were soon ready for publication, but they found no\r\nEnglish publisher ready to risk putting them out. Even the powerful\r\ninfluence of Sir Walter Scott, Irving's cordial friend, could not\r\nprevail at first with John Murray, \"the prince of publishers.\" In 1819\r\nSidney Smith's contemptuous and famous query, \"Who reads an American\r\nbook?\" was fairly representative of the English-reading public. Murray\r\nwas interested in Irving's manuscript, but did not see any prospect of\r\nselling enough books to justify the risk of publication. Irving had\r\nwanted the indorsement of Murray's imprint to offset the severity of\r\nthe kind of English criticism deplored years earlier by John Trumbull\r\n(see p. 111). As soon, however, as the sketches were printed in New\r\nYork in a set of seven modest installments, the attention of English\r\nreaders was attracted to them, and Irving heard rumors that a \"pirated\"\r\nEnglish edition was to appear. There was no international copyright\r\nin those days, and no adequate one until as late as 1899; so that a\r\nbook printed on one side of the Atlantic was fair game for anyone who\r\nchose to steal it on the other. If an author wanted his works to appear\r\ncorrectly and to get his full money return for them, it was necessary\r\nfor him to go through all the details of publishing independently\r\nin both countries. After a great deal of difficulty, therefore,\r\nIrving contrived to get out an English edition through an inefficient\r\npublisher, but the success of it was so marked that Murray soon saw\r\nthe light and from then on was eager to get the English rights for\r\neverything that Irving wrote and to pay him in advance five, ten, and,\r\nin one case, as much as fifteen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of \"The Sketch Book\" England arrived at a new\r\nanswer for Sidney Smith's question. Irving was sought as a celebrity\r\nby the many, in addition to being loved as a charming gentleman by his\r\nolder friends. Few tributes are more telling than that contained in a\r\nletter written many years later by Charles Dickens in which he refers\r\nto the delight he took in Irving's pages when he was \"a small and not\r\nover particularly well taken care of boy.\" Even the austere _Edinburgh\r\nReview_ indorsed the American as a writer of \"great purity and beauty\r\nof diction.\" From the most feared critic in the English-speaking\r\nworld to the neglected boy whose father was in debtors' prison Irving\r\nreceived enough applause quite to turn the head of a less modest man.\r\n\r\n\"The Sketch Book\" includes over thirty papers of four or five\r\ndifferent kinds. About fifteen are definite observations on English\r\nlife and habits as seen in country towns and on country estates. Of\r\nthe remainder six are literary essays of various kinds; four are in\r\nthe nature of personal traveling reminiscences; three are the famous\r\nshort stories--\"Rip Van Winkle,\" \"Sleepy Hollow,\" and the \"The Spectre\r\nBridegroom\"; and five so far defy classification as to fall under the\r\nconvenient category of \"miscellaneous.\"\r\n\r\nAs a document in literary history the sixth paper deserves far more\r\nnotice than is usually conceded to it, for as a rule it is totally\r\nneglected. This is entitled \"British Writers on America.\" The tone of\r\nEnglish literary criticism has already been referred to. Irving called\r\nattention to the fact that all English writings on America and the\r\nAmericans were equally ill-natured. He pointed out that ordinarily\r\nEnglish readers demanded strictest accuracy from author-travelers;\r\nthat if a man who wrote a book on the regions of the Upper Nile or the\r\nunknown islands of the Yellow Sea was caught in error at a few minor\r\npoints, he was held up to scorn as careless and unreliable, and another\r\nEnglish traveler who could convict him of mistakes or misstatements\r\ncould completely discredit him. But in marked contrast to this, no such\r\nscrupulousness was demanded of visitors to the United States. Books on\r\nthe new nation in the Western World were written and read to satisfy\r\nunfriendly prejudice rather than to supply exact information and honest\r\nopinion. Against a continuation of such a practice Irving gave warning,\r\nnot merely because it was uncharitable but because in time it would\r\nestrange the two peoples and lose for England a friend with whom she\r\ncould not afford to be at loggerheads.\r\n\r\n  Is all this to be at end? Is this golden band of kindred sympathies,\r\n  so rare between nations, to be broken forever? Perhaps it may be\r\n  for the best. It may dispel an illusion which might have kept us in\r\n  mental vassalage; which might have interfered occasionally with our\r\n  true interests, and prevented the growth of proper national pride.\r\n  But it is hard to give up the kindred tie! and there are feelings\r\n  dearer than interest--closer to the heart than pride--that will make\r\n  us cast back a look of regret as we wander farther and farther from\r\n  the paternal roof, and lament the waywardness of the parent that\r\n  would repel the affections of the child.\r\n\r\nThere were probably many other Americans capable of making the warning\r\nprophecy so notably fulfilled nearly a hundred years later, though few,\r\nperhaps, who would have put it in such temperate language; but Irving\r\nwent further in following with a warning to his fellow-countrymen:\r\n\r\n  Shortsighted and injudicious, however, as the conduct of England\r\n  may be in this system of aspersion, recrimination on our part would\r\n  be equally ill-judged.... Let us guard particularly against such a\r\n  temper, for it would double the evil instead of redressing the wrong.\r\n  Nothing is so easy and inviting as the retort of abuse and sarcasm,\r\n  but it is a paltry and unprofitable contest.... The members of a\r\n  republic, above all other men, should be candid and dispassionate.\r\n  They are, individually, portions of the sovereign mind and sovereign\r\n  will, and should be enabled to come to all questions of national\r\n  concern with calm and unbiased judgments.... Let it be the pride of\r\n  our writers, therefore, discarding all feelings of irritation, and\r\n  disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of British authors, to speak\r\n  of the English nation without prejudice and with determined candor.\r\n\r\nIf there is any justification for calling an American essay \"The\r\nAmerican Declaration of Literary Independence\" the title should be\r\nconferred on this neglected number in \"The Sketch Book.\" It was long\r\nbefore either English or American writers were wise enough to follow\r\nIrving's counsels, but he himself was always as tactful as he was\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\n\"The Sketch Book\" as a whole, then, can best be understood as an\r\nAmerican's comments on English life and custom, made at a time when\r\n\"the retort of abuse and sarcasm\" would have been quite natural.\r\nIn the opening paper, as well as in the sixth, there is a gentle\r\nreminder that the literary east wind had felt rather sharp and nipping\r\nin New York. Irving is describing himself after the fashion of the\r\neighteenth-century essayists at the introduction of a series, and at\r\nthe end indulges in this little nudge of irony:\r\n\r\n  A great man of Europe, thought I, must ... be as superior to a great\r\n  man of America, as a peak of the Alps to a highland of the Hudson;\r\n  and in this idea I was confirmed by observing the comparative\r\n  importance and swelling magnitude of many English travelers among us,\r\n  who, I was assured, were very little people in their own country. I\r\n  will visit this land of wonders, thought I, and see the gigantic race\r\n  from which I am degenerated.\r\n\r\nHis summarized impressions of the typical Englishman are contained\r\nin the thirtieth paper, on \"John Bull.\" This keen analysis will bear\r\nthe closest reading and study, and the more one knows of English\r\nhistory the more interesting it becomes. In this respect it is like\r\n\"Gulliver's Travels,\" for it is full of double meanings. To the\r\ninattentive or the immature it is simply a picture of a bluff, hearty,\r\nquick-tempered, over-conservative average English country gentleman,\r\nbut to the intelligent and attentive reader this gentleman turns out\r\nto be the embodiment of the English government and the British Empire.\r\nThe character of Parliament, the relation between Church and State, the\r\ncondition of the national treasury, the attitude of the rulers toward\r\nreform legislation and toward the colonies, dependencies, and dominions\r\nare all treated with kindly humor by the visiting critic. The picture\r\nis by no means a flattering one, but it was Irving's happy gift to be\r\nable to indulge in really biting satire and yet to do so in such a\r\ncourteous and friendly way that his words carried little sting. Part of\r\nthe concluding paragraph to this essay will illustrate his method of\r\ncombining justice with mercy:\r\n\r\n  Though there may be something rather whimsical in all this, yet I\r\n  confess I cannot look upon John's situation without strong feelings\r\n  of interest. With all his odd humors and obstinate prejudices, he is\r\n  a sterling-hearted old blade. He may not be so wonderfully fine a\r\n  fellow as he thinks himself, but he is at least twice as good as his\r\n  neighbors represent him. His virtues are all his own; all plain,\r\n  home-bred, and unaffected. His very faults smack of the raciness of\r\n  his good qualities. His extravagance savors of his generosity; his\r\n  quarrelsomeness of his courage; his credulity of his open faith; his\r\n  vanity of his pride; and his bluntness of his sincerity. They are all\r\n  the redundancies of a rich and liberal character.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit Irving wrote the other sketches of John Bull as he\r\nappears in \"Rural Life,\" \"The Country Church,\" \"The Inn Kitchen,\" and\r\nthe group of five Christmas pictures.\r\n\r\nTo judge from these eight scenes of English country life, Irving, a\r\nvisitor from a new and unsettled land, was chiefly fascinated by the\r\nevidences of old age and tradition on every side. For this reason, if\r\nfor no other, he delighted in the customs of the country squires who\r\nhad not been swept out of their ancient order by the tide of modern\r\ntrade. Even the English scenery was in his mind \"associated with ideas\r\nof order, of quiet, of sober, well-established principles, of hoary\r\nusage and reverend custom. Everything seems to be the growth of ages\r\nof regular and peaceful existence.\" As Irving observed it, it was\r\nstill the \"Merrie England\" of song and story, an England, therefore,\r\nbeautifully typified in the celebration of the Christmas festivities.\r\nThere is a touch of autobiography in his comment on the good cheer that\r\nprevailed at Bracebridge Hall,--a home that Squire Bracebridge tried\r\nto make his children feel was the happiest place in the world,--it\r\nwas so utterly different from the suppressed family circle over which\r\nhis Presbyterian father had ruled. As a guest he enjoyed all the\r\npicturesque and quaint merrymaking at the Hall, and re-conjured up\r\npictures like those which Addison had previously drawn at Sir Roger\r\nde Coverley's. Yet all the while he was aware that the old English\r\ngentleman was a costly luxury for England to maintain, that Squire\r\nBracebridge was after all nothing but John Bull, and that John Bull\r\nwas inclining to lag behind his age. As a student of Goldsmith, Irving\r\nhad read \"The Deserted Village\"; the thought of it seems to have come\r\nback to him while writing \"Rural Life\"; for a moment the usurpation of\r\nthe land by the wealthy disquieted him, but then he consoled himself\r\nwith the comforting thought that abuses of this sort were \"but casual\r\noutbreaks in the general system.\" Irving was writing as an observer who\r\nfound much to admire in the external beauty of the old order of things,\r\nbut at the bottom of his American mind it is quite apparent that\r\nthere was a silent approval of gradual reform in \"the good old ways.\"\r\nSquire Bracebridge was delightful to Irving, but on the whole he was a\r\ndelightful old fogy.\r\n\r\nIrving's papers on London--\"The Boar's Head Tavern,\" \"Westminster\r\nAbbey,\" and \"Little Britain\"--are full of a similar reverence for old\r\nage in the life of the community. In the same mood in which he laughed\r\nat the pranks of the Christmas Lord of Misrule, he made his way to\r\nEastcheap, \"that ancient region of wit and wassail, where the very\r\nnames of the streets relished of good cheer, as Pudding Lane bears\r\ntestimony even at the present day\"; and he took much more evident\r\nsatisfaction in his recollection of Shakespearean revelries than in his\r\nhours in Westminster, the \"mingled picture of glory and decay.\" Once\r\nagain in \"Little Britain\" Irving was in more congenial surroundings,\r\nfor he preferred to smile at the echoes of dead laughter than to\r\nshudder at the reminders of vanished greatness.\r\n\r\n  Little Britain may truly be called the heart's core of the city;\r\n  the strong-hold of true John Bullism. It is a fragment of London as\r\n  it was in its better days, with its antiquated folks and fashions.\r\n  Here flourish in great preservation many of the holiday games and\r\n  customs of yore. The inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on\r\n  Shrove Tuesday, hot-cross-buns on Good Friday, and roast goose at\r\n  Michaelmas; they send love-letters on Valentine's Day, burn the\r\n  Pope on the fifth of November, and kiss all the girls under the\r\n  mistletoe at Christmas. Roast beef and plum-pudding are also held in\r\n  superstitious veneration, and port and sherry maintain their grounds\r\n  as the only true English wines.\r\n\r\nIn more than casual respect for such traditions Irving goes on to\r\nintroduce the rival oracles of Little Britain, to escort us to\r\nWagstaff's and the Roaring Lads, to act as personal conductor to\r\nBartholomew Fairs and a Lord Mayor's Day, and finally to lament the\r\nbaleful influence of the socially ambitious Misses Lamb and the decline\r\nof the choice old games All-Fours, Pope Joan, and Tom-come-tickle-me.\r\nIt is no wonder that the youthful Dickens loved these papers, for the\r\nsame England appealed to both Irving and Dickens throughout their\r\nlives. It was a rough, boisterous, jolly England, with a good deal of\r\nvulgarity which they were ready to forgive and a good many vices which\r\nthey chose to overlook in favor of its chief virtues--a blunt honesty,\r\na hearty laugh, and a full stomach.\r\n\r\nThere is another side of old England that was dear to those two--that\r\nJohn Bull could \"easily be moved to a sudden tear\" (see p. 109, first\r\ntopic). In the old days of even a hundred years ago men of Saxon stock\r\nwere much more ready to express themselves than they are to-day, for\r\nthe accepted manners of the present are comparatively reserved and\r\nimpassive. If a man was amused he laughed loud and long; if he was\r\nangered he came up with \"a word and a blow\"; and if his deeper feelings\r\nwere touched he was not ashamed of a tear. In fact he seemed almost\r\nto feel a certain pride in his \"sensibility,\" as if his power to weep\r\nproved that his nature was not destitute of finer feeling and made\r\nup for his quickness to wrath and his fondness for a broad joke. In\r\nperhaps unconscious recognition of this habit of mind the literature\r\nof a century ago contained a great many frank appeals to the reader's\r\nfeeling for pathos, appeals which the modern reader would be likely to\r\ncondemn as unworthily sentimental.\r\n\r\nIn the history of literature a distinction is made between\r\n\"sentiment\"--the ability to respond to the finer emotions, such as\r\nlove, sorrow, reverence, patriotism, worship--and \"sentimentalism\"--the\r\nunrestricted expression of these emotions by eloquence, tears, and\r\nfeminine sighs, blushes, and swoonings. For this sentimentalism,\r\nwhich was a literary fashion of his period, Irving found an outlet\r\nin sketches like \"The Wife,\" \"The Broken Heart,\" \"The Widow and her\r\nSon,\" and \"The Pride of the Village.\" The first is on \"the fortitude\r\nwith which women sustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune,\"\r\na sketch in which the husband is the sentimentalist. He has lost his\r\nmoney and is afraid to shock his wife with the revelation, but his\r\n\"altered looks and stifled sighs\" half betray him. In \"an agony of\r\ntears\" he tells a friend, and by him is persuaded to be honest with\r\nher. Her latent heroism comes out in the face of his announcement; and\r\non her welcome to him at his first homecoming to the modest cottage\r\nhe is rendered speechless, and tears once more gush into his eyes.\r\nThe second is a direct attempt to shame \"those who have outlived the\r\nsusceptibility of early feeling, or have been brought up ... to laugh\r\nat all love stories.\" The third, on \"The Widow and her Son,\" is more\r\nconvincing to the reader of to-day, for it is on the tragic picture of\r\na fond parent's bereavement. The fourth is the best example of all.\r\nThe pride of the village is introduced as \"blushing and smiling in all\r\nthe beautiful confusion of girlish diffidence and delight.\" She falls\r\nin love with a gallant young soldier, who begs her to accompany him\r\nwhen he is ordered to the front. Shocked at his perfidy she clasps\r\nher hands in agony, then succumbs to \"faintings and hysterics,\" and\r\nthen goes into a decline. After some time her lover returns to her and\r\nrushes into the house. \"She was too faint to rise--she attempted to\r\nextend her trembling hand--her lips moved as if she spoke, but no word\r\nwas articulated--she looked down upon him with a smile of unutterable\r\ntenderness--and closed her eyes forever!\" If these sketches seem unreal\r\nand even amusing to the student, it is partly because they are actually\r\noverdrawn and partly because the present generation has repressed, if\r\nit has not \"outlived, the susceptibility of early feeling.\"\r\n\r\nTwo other types of work remain to be mentioned. The first is the\r\nliterary essay, in which the chief interest arises from Irving's\r\nsympathetic appreciation of his English masters. From these\r\nessays--there are five of distinct importance--it appears that he was\r\nespecially well-read in the writings of a much earlier period and that\r\nhe took pleasure in dwelling on passages which were characterized,\r\nas his own work came to be, by \"great purity and beauty of diction.\"\r\nThe other group is the most famous in \"The Sketch Book,\" the three\r\nstories of which \"Rip Van Winkle\" is the best known. This is extremely\r\ninteresting for several reasons. The first is that it is a good story,\r\nwhich will long be read for its own sake, and as such it needs no\r\ncomment, for it is familiar to everyone. But it is also a milestone in\r\nliterary history. One reason for this is that it carries into practice\r\na principle that American authors had long been talking and writing\r\nabout--the principle of using native material. It is located in the\r\nCatskill Mountains and in the years before and after the Revolutionary\r\nWar. It introduces real colonial and early American people. Although\r\nit is a far-fetched romance in its theme, it makes use of homely,\r\nrealistic details. Jonathan Doolittle's hotel was just the sort of\r\nshabby boarding house that marred the countryside during the slipshod\r\nyears after the Revolution and that survived into Irving's youth. \"A\r\nlarge rickety wooden building ... with great gaping windows, some of\r\nthem broken and mended with old hats and petticoats.\" The sign was\r\nstrangely changed from pre-Revolution days. \"The red coat was changed\r\nfor one of blue and buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a\r\nsceptre, the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was\r\npainted in large characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON.\" The fact that the\r\nfolk story about Hendrick Hudson and his crew had some basis in a\r\nGerman superstition does not affect the fact that Irving completely\r\nlocalized it and gave it its enduring fame as an American tale.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why this story stands out in literary history is that\r\nit is one of the first really successful examples of the modern\r\nshort story, and that in this sense it represents America's chief\r\ncontribution to the types of literature. We are likely to take for\r\ngranted that all the popular forms of literature have existed since the\r\nbeginning of time. Yet prose stories of any kind were comparatively\r\nmodern a hundred years ago, and most of them were long narratives in\r\ntwo or three and sometimes as many as six or seven volumes. What short\r\nstories existed were merely condensed novels, not limited to any brief\r\nperiod and not developed with any definite detail. \"Rip Van Winkle\" was\r\nstrikingly different from its vague and shapeless forerunners. After\r\nthe introduction it was limited to two short passages of time--the\r\nfew hours just before and the few hours just after Rip went to sleep\r\non the mountain. And the whole story was composed to lead up to the\r\nmain point,--the chief point of this history and of all history,--the\r\nrelentless way in which life moves on, regardless of the individual\r\nwho falls asleep and is left behind. All the details in the story help\r\nto develop this idea. Rip, the ne'er-do-well, was the sort of man to\r\nserve as the central character, for he was more anxious to escape life\r\nthan to take his part in it. His eager, querulous, sharp-tongued wife\r\nreminded him of the burden of living only to make him avoid it the\r\nmore; her loss was the only one which he did not regret on his return.\r\nHis dog and gun, which he missed first and missed most keenly, were\r\nthe pride of the old-fashioned trapper out of place in the up-to-date\r\nAmerican village. The years bridging the Revolution were the most\r\nnatural and effective ones to mark the kind of change that is always\r\ntaking place; and Rip's experience in finding that loyalty to a\r\ndiscarded monarchy was treason to a new republic was simply an emphatic\r\nillustration of what will usually happen to a man who lives in the past\r\ninstead of in the present. It is not at all necessary to assume that\r\nIrving chose the old folk-legend in order to expound this theme, or\r\neven that he was conscious of the completeness with which he was doing\r\nit. The fact remains that it was remarkable in its day for its clear\r\ncompactness, and that it meets one of the tests of enduring fiction in\r\ntelling a good story well and of building that story out of elements\r\nthat convey some truth about life.\r\n\r\n\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is comparable to \"Rip Van Winkle\" only\r\nin its use of native American character, scenes, and tradition. It is\r\nhardly a short story at all, but rather a prolonged sketch full of\r\n\"local atmosphere\" and partly strung on a narrative thread. Ichabod\r\nCrane and his townsmen, except for Brom Bones and his gang, are\r\nlike Rip in one respect, for they are representative citizens in a\r\ntown where \"population, manners and customs remain fixed; while the\r\ngreat torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such\r\nincessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by\r\nthem unobserved.\" Ichabod was an interesting survival, too, because\r\nhis combination of learning and superstition had come to him from a\r\ndistinguished source, for he \"was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's\r\nhistory of New England witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most\r\nfirmly and potently believed. He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small\r\nshrewdness and simple credulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and\r\nhis powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary, and both had\r\nbeen increased by his residence in this spellbound region. No tale was\r\ntoo gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often his\r\ndelight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch\r\nhimself on the rich bed of clover, bordering the little brook that\r\nwhimpered by his schoolhouse, and there con over old Mather's direful\r\ntales, until the gathering dusk of the evening made the printed page\r\na mere mist before his eyes.\" Ichabod, moreover, is a comic type in\r\nAmerican life in the early nineteenth century, who seems to have been\r\nequally disliked by all the New Yorkers--the Puritan descendant\r\nstrayed from home. Cooper's David Gamut is one of the same crop. The\r\nstory of the Headless Horseman, like that of the Spectre Bridegroom,\r\nis, of course, only a make-believe ghost story, neither important nor\r\nwell told. The real interest in the sketch lies in its picture of\r\nsimple country life. The whole scene at Baltus Van Tassel's house is\r\nas clear and vivid as the contrasting scenes at Bracebridge Hall or as\r\nWhittier's picture of another family scene in \"Snow-Bound.\" The third\r\nwell-known story in \"The Sketch Book,\" \"The Spectre Bridegroom,\" is,\r\nlike \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\" more of a sketch than a story, and\r\ndoes not pretend to be laid on American soil.\r\n\r\nIt is a common experience of schoolboys and schoolgirls to feel on\r\nreading Irving for the first time that his way of writing is stiff and\r\nunnatural. Compared with the fashion of to-day the wording and sentence\r\nstructure of \"The Sketch Book\" deserve such a verdict. But to render it\r\nagainst the writing of a hundred years ago, without comparing the book\r\nin question with others of its own generation, is to ignore the very\r\npoint of \"Rip Van Winkle\"--that fashions change. Assuming, then, that\r\nstyles do change, and that Irving was no more formal than other authors\r\nof his day, it is still worth while to see what some of the main points\r\nof contrast are between 1819 and 1919. Here are two passages that\r\nwill serve as a basis for comparison. The first is from \"Philip of\r\nPokanoket,\" one of the two \"Sketch Book\" essays written in America.\r\n\r\n  It is to be regretted that those early writers, who treated of\r\n  the discovery and settlement of America, have not given us more\r\n  particular and candid accounts of the remarkable characters that\r\n  flourished in savage life. The scanty anecdotes which have reached\r\n  us are full of peculiarity and interest; they furnish us with nearer\r\n  glimpses of human nature, and show what man is in a comparatively\r\n  primitive state, and what he owes to civilization. There is something\r\n  of the charm of discovery in lighting upon these wild and unexplored\r\n  tracts of human nature; in witnessing, as it were, the native growth\r\n  of moral sentiment, and perceiving those generous and romantic\r\n  qualities which have been artificially cultivated by society,\r\n  vegetating in spontaneous hardihood and rude magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe second is from G. S. Lee's \"Crowds,\" Bk. I, chap, viii:\r\n\r\n  The future in America cannot be pictured. The only place it can be\r\n  seen is in people's faces. Go out into the street, in New York, in\r\n  Chicago, in San Francisco, in Seattle; look eagerly as you go into\r\n  the faces of the men who pass, and you feel hundreds of years--the\r\n  next hundred years--like a breath swept past. America, with all\r\n  its forty-story buildings, its little play Niagaras, its great\r\n  dumb Rockies, is the unseen country. It can only as yet be seen in\r\n  people's eyes. Some days, flowing sublime and silent through our\r\n  noisy streets, and through the vast panorama of our towers, I have\r\n  heard the footfalls of the unborn, like sunshine around me.\r\n\r\nThese passages have almost exactly the same number of words,--the\r\nformer one hundred and fifteen and the latter one hundred and\r\nseventeen,--but a glance at the printed page shows that Irving's words\r\ntake up one fifth more space than Lee's do. The reason is that Irving\r\nuses twenty-six words of more than two syllables, and Lee, aside\r\nfrom place-names, only two. Although both passages are written in\r\nanalysis of American conditions, Irving, who is discussing the past,\r\nemploys abstract or general words--to use the nouns alone, words like\r\n_discovery_, _anecdotes_, _peculiarity_, _civilisation_, _sentiment_,\r\n_qualities_, _magnificence_; Lee, who is looking to the future, uses\r\ndefinite and picturesque terms like _faces_, _street_, _buildings_,\r\n_eyes_, _panorama_, _towers_, _footfalls_,--uses these words even\r\nthough he admits the idea he is dealing with cannot be pictured. Again,\r\nIrving cast his one hundred and fifteen words into three sentences\r\naveraging nearly forty words in length, and Lee put his into six,\r\naveraging a fraction less than twenty. Finally, all Irving's sentences\r\nare \"loose,\" or so built that the reader may rest or even stop with\r\na completed sense before he comes to the end; but four out of six in\r\nLee's passage are \"periodic,\" or so constructed that you must read to\r\nthe end or be left hanging in mid-air.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be forcing the issue absurdly far to insist or\r\neven suggest that so broad a comparison would apply without exception\r\nto the writers of a hundred years ago and of to-day, but in general\r\nthere is a fair deduction to be drawn. Irving belonged to a group who\r\nwere still addressing an eighteenth-century audience, an audience\r\nmade up of \"gentle readers\"--men who enjoyed the rhythmical flow of a\r\ncourtly and elegant style, who felt that there was a virtue in purity\r\nand beauty of diction apart from any idea the diction was supposed to\r\nexpress; but the modern reader esteems literature as a means rather\r\nthan an end. It must catch and hold his attention; it must be clear and\r\nforcible first, and elegant as a secondary matter; and its words and\r\nsentences must be chosen and put together as a challenge to a reader in\r\nthe midst of a restless, driving, twentieth-century world. With these\r\nfacts in mind one may say, if he will, that Washington Irving was stiff\r\nand formal, but he should say this as marking a difference and not a\r\nnecessary inferiority in Irving.\r\n\r\nIrving lived until 1859, but the richly fruitful part of his life was\r\nfrom 1819, the year in which the serial publication of \"The Sketch\r\nBook\" began, to 1832, the year of his return from abroad. In this\r\nperiod he published ten books and all the best known of his works\r\nbut the lives of Goldsmith and Washington. When he came back after\r\nseventeen years' absence he was known and admired in England, France,\r\nand Germany, and the most popular of American authors. Irving was one\r\nof the first to profit, American fashion, by a European reputation\r\nreflected and redoubled at home. At the dinner of welcome tendered him\r\nsoon after his arrival he showed how absence had made the heart grow\r\nfonder:\r\n\r\n  I come from gloomier climes to one of brilliant sunshine and\r\n  inspiring purity. I come from countries lowering with doubt and\r\n  danger, where the rich man trembles and the poor man frowns--where\r\n  all repine at the present and dread the future. I come from these\r\n  to a country where all is life and animation; where I hear on every\r\n  side the sound of exultation; where everyone speaks of the past\r\n  with triumph, the present with delight, the future with growing and\r\n  confident anticipation.\r\n\r\nAnd here, he went on to say, he proposed to remain as long as he lived.\r\nThese last twenty-seven years were filled with honors. He had already\r\nreceived the gold medal from the Royal Society of Literature and the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Laws from Oxford University. Now he was to have\r\nthe refusal of a whole succession of public offices and the leadership\r\nof a whole \"school\" of writers. Diedrich Knickerbocker had become\r\na household word, which was applied to the Knickerbocker school of\r\nIrving's followers and used in the christening of the _Knickerbocker\r\nMagazine_ (1833-1865). Irving was in truth a connecting link between\r\nthe century of his birth and the century of his achievements. He\r\ncarried over the spirit and the manners of Addison and Goldsmith into\r\nthe New World and into the age of steam. With him it was a natural\r\nmode of thought and way of expression, but with his imitators it was\r\naffected and superficial--so much so that the Knickerbocker school\r\ndeclined and the _Knickerbocker Magazine_ went out of existence shortly\r\nafter Irving's death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe leading figure in the Knickerbocker school was Fitz-Greene Halleck,\r\nwho was born in Connecticut in 1790 but spent his active life in\r\nNew York. When he came up to the city, at the age of twenty-one, he\r\nfell in with the literary people of the town and shared their eager\r\ninterest in the current English output. According to his biographer\r\nthey were absorbed in \"The Lady of the Lake\" and \"Marmion,\" in\r\nCampbell's \"Pleasures of Hope,\" Rogers's \"Pleasures of Memory,\"\r\nMoore's \"Melodies,\" Miss Porter's \"Scottish Chiefs\" and \"Thaddeus of\r\nWarsaw,\" and, a little later, in \"Waverley,\" \"Guy Mannering,\" and \"The\r\nAntiquary\"--works that in Halleck's opinion produced \"a wide-spread\r\nenthusiasm throughout Great Britain and this country which has probably\r\nnever been equalled in the history of literature.\"\r\n\r\nHalleck (as already cited on page 113) was uncomfortably conscious of\r\nthe prosaic commercial drive of American life and disposed to lament\r\nthe wane of romance. His regret for the passage of \"the good old days\"\r\nhe frequently expressed in the poems he wrote between the ages of\r\ntwenty-five and thirty--\"Alnwick Castle,\" \"Red-Jacket,\" \"A Sketch,\" \"A\r\nPoet's Daughter\"; and in \"Wyoming\" he sometimes grieved for the old and\r\nsometimes protested at the new. When in 1823 he wrote \"Marco Bozzaris,\"\r\nhe lived up to his own thesis, taking an heroic episode of immediate\r\ninterest--August 20, 1823--and putting it into a ballad for freedom\r\nthat has probably been declaimed as often as \"The Charge of the Light\r\nBrigade\" or \"How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile he had become the intimate of the talented young\r\nJoseph Rodman Drake. Their friendship had sprung from a common love\r\nof romantic poetry, but the joint work which they undertook was a\r\nseries of contemporary satires. These were printed in _The National\r\nAdvocate_ and the New York _Evening Post_ between March and July,\r\n1819. Thirty-five of them appeared over the signature of \"Croaker,\"\r\nfrom which they became known as the \"Croaker Papers.\" They were both\r\npertinent and impertinent, aided by the mystery of their authorship\r\nand accumulating in interest through the uncertainty as to when the\r\nnext would appear and whom it would assail. The more general in theme\r\nhad the same underlying good sense which belonged to the earlier\r\n_Salmagundis_ (see p. 116), and in their simple and often brutal\r\ndirectness they must have offered then, as they do now, a relief from\r\nthe fashionable echoes of secondary English poets. Later in 1819\r\nHalleck resumed the same strain in \"Fanny\"--the account in about a\r\nthousand lines of the rise and fall of Fanny and her father in New\r\nYork finance and society.[11] Among many efforts of the sort Stedman's\r\n\"Diamond Wedding\" and Butler's \"Nothing to Wear\" have been the only\r\nlater approach, and all have been true not merely of New York but of\r\nthe same stage in most quick-growing American cities.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Drake died at the age of twenty-five, leaving as his literary\r\nbequest the inspiration for Halleck's memorial verses,\r\n\r\n      Green be the turf above thee\r\n        Friend of my better days!\r\n\r\nas well as his share in the \"Croaker Papers,\" and \"The Culprit Fay,\"\r\nand certain shorter poems which give promise of things much greater\r\nthan this overrated attempt. The \"Fay,\" according to a letter by\r\nHalleck, was a three-day production of 1816, written to demonstrate\r\nthat the Hudson River scenery could be turned to literary account.\r\nWhether or no the anecdote is true, Drake wrote to this point in his\r\n\"To a Friend,\" and in \"Niagara\" and \"Bronx.\" Yet the fact is worth\r\nremark that nothing in \"The Culprit Fay\" is any more explicitly true\r\nof the Hudson region than of the Rhine country or the Norwegian\r\nfiords. The poem reads like a pure fantasy, hurriedly and carelessly\r\nwritten by an inexperienced hand. Nevertheless, when published it was\r\nextravagantly praised. Halleck said, \"It is certainly the best thing of\r\nthe kind in the English language, and is more strikingly original than\r\nI had supposed it was possible for a modern poem to be.\"[12]\r\n\r\n  [11] An interesting tribute is paid this poem by Ezra Pound in\r\n       a footnote to \"L'Homme Moyen Sensuel,\" in \"Pavannes and\r\n       Divisions,\" p. 33. \"I would give these rhymes now with\r\n       dedication 'To the Anonymous Compatriot Who Produced the Poem\r\n       \"Fanny\" Somewhere About 1820,' if this form of centennial homage\r\n       be permitted me. It was no small thing to have written, in\r\n       America, at that distant date, a poem of over forty pages which\r\n       one can still read without labor.\"\r\n\r\n  [12] It was reserved for Poe to write a genuinely critical estimate\r\n       of it. See _The Southern Literary Messenger_, Vol. II, pp. 326\r\n       ff. Reprinted in \"The Literati,\" p. 374.\r\n\r\nIn Halleck's exclamatory surprise at originality in any modern poem\r\nis to be found the vital difference between the two friends. Halleck\r\nseemed to believe that the final canons for art had been fixed, and\r\ncould hardly conceive of originality in a nineteenth-century poet;\r\nbut Drake tried new things and rebelled at the old. His best efforts,\r\nhowever qualified their success, were strainings at the leash of\r\neighteenth-century convention.\r\n\r\n      Go! kneel a worshipper at nature's shrine!\r\n      For you her fields are green, and fair her skies!\r\n      For you her rivers flow, her hills arise!\r\n      And will you scorn them all, to pour forth tame\r\n      And heartless lays of feigned or fancied sighs?\r\n      And will you cloud the muse? nor blush for shame\r\n      To cast away renown, and hide your head from fame?\r\n\r\nAs \"The Culprit Fay\" shows, Drake's idea was to escape from the\r\ndrawing-room into the open, but when in the open to weave, as it were,\r\nGobelin tapestries for drawing-room use. He saw no gleam of essential\r\npoetry in democracy or the crowded town, yet in his vague craving for\r\nsomething better than Georgian iterations he showed that the revival of\r\nindividualism was at work in him. The story is told that his intimacy\r\nwith Halleck began in his accord with the latter's wish that he could\r\n\"lounge upon the rainbow, and read 'Tom Campbell.'\" In his aspirations\r\nhe seems to have been nearer to the spirit of Keats and Shelley.\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, the more independent of the two was taken\r\noff before his prime, and Halleck, the survivor, settled down into\r\ncomplacent Knickerbockerism. With his nicety of taste, his keen\r\neye, his fund of humor, and his frankness, he was an established\r\nliterary and social favorite. He was the kind of handsome and courtly\r\ngentleman of the old school, as Irving was also, who became a friend\r\nand associate of the leading financier of the day. There was nothing\r\nrestless or disconcerting about him. He was a critic of manners, but\r\nnot of the social order. He probably knew little of Emerson, and he\r\ncertainly disapproved of Whitman. In 1848, when less than sixty years\r\nof age, he went back to his native town in Connecticut and lived there\r\ntill after the Civil War, totally unaffected as a man of letters,\r\nexcept as the conflict seems to have silenced him. But he was not\r\nalone, for when he sank into eclipse all the Knickerbockers disappeared\r\nwith him. Their vogue was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Authors_=\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON IRVING. First posthumous complete edition.

Close attention will reveal obligations not merely in the\r\nuse of a foreign observer, a slight narrative thread, and the kind of\r\ntopics treated, but also in actual detail passages.\r\n\r\nRead passages covering the education of Goldsmith in Irving's Life, in\r\nMacaulay's essay, and in Thackeray's \"English Humourists,\" and compare\r\nthe degrees of sympathy with which Goldsmith is presented.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the problems of international copyright, see\r\npassages indicated in the table of contents or index of the following\r\nvolumes: \"Matthew Carey, Publisher,\" by E.

B. Paine, 1912.\r\n\r\nRead \"John Bull\" in \"The Sketch Book\" for the passages in specific\r\nreference to the English government.\r\n\r\nRead \"Rural Life\" in \"The Sketch Book\" for a further obligation to\r\nGoldsmith--the influence of \"The Deserted Village.\"\r\n\r\nRead \"Bracebridge Hall\" for a further development of English life and\r\ncharacter begun in the \"Sketch Book\" essays discussed in the text.\r\n\r\nRead \"The Alhambra\" for a comparison in subject matter, method, and\r\ntone with the three stories in \"The Sketch Book.\"\r\n\r\nPick out the five essays in literary criticism in \"The Sketch Book\" for\r\nthe light they throw on Irving's literary likings and critical acumen.\r\n\r\nRead in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" the description of the domestic\r\ngroup at the Van Tassels for comparison with similar pictures in the\r\nEnglish sketches.\r\n\r\nCompare the \"Croaker Papers\" with the \"Salmagundi Papers.\"\r\n\r\nRead Halleck's \"Fanny\" (see Boynton, \"American Poetry,\" pp. 154-158)\r\nfor comparison in method with the \"Croaker Papers.\"\r\n\r\nRead Joseph Rodman Drake's \"To a Friend\" for an appeal for originality\r\ncharacteristic of the period and then read \"The Culprit Fay\" (\"American\r\nPoetry,\" pp. 136-146) for a nonfulfillment of the authors' own appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                         JAMES FENIMORE COOPER\r\n\r\n\r\nCooper's life (1789-1851) was inclosed by Irving's, for he was born\r\nsix years later and died eight years earlier. When he was a little\r\nmore than a year old his father took his large family--Cooper was\r\nthe eleventh of twelve children--to the shore of Otsego Lake, New\r\nYork, where he had bought a tract, after the Revolution. It was\r\nuncleared country, but here Judge Cooper laid out what developed into\r\nCooperstown, established a big estate, and built a pretentious house.\r\nHis scheme of life was aristocratic, more like that of the first\r\nVirginia settlers than like that of the Massachusetts Puritans. Here\r\nthe boy grew up in an ambitious home, but among primitive frontier\r\nsurroundings, until he needed better schooling than Cooperstown could\r\noffer. To prepare for Yale College he was sent to Albany and put in\r\ncharge of the rector of St. Peter's Church. Under this gentleman he\r\ngained not only the \"book learning\" for which he went but also a\r\nfurther sense of the gentry's point of view--a point of view which\r\nthroughout his life made him frankly critical of the defects in America\r\neven while he was passionately loyal to it. At thirteen he was admitted\r\nto Yale. This sounds as if he were a precocious child, but there was\r\nnothing unusual in the performance, for the colleges were hardly more\r\nthan advanced academies where most of the students received their\r\ndegrees well before they were twenty. This was the institution which\r\nJohn Trumbull--who had passed his examinations at seven!--had held\r\nup to scorn in his \"Progress of Dulness,\" and where his hero, Tom\r\nBrainless,\r\n\r\n      Four years at college dozed away\r\n      In sleep, and slothfulness and play,\r\n\r\nbut even from here Cooper's unstudious and disorderly ways caused his\r\ndismissal in his second year. His formal education was now ended, and\r\nin his development as a writer it was doubtless much less important\r\nthan his earlier years in the wilderness west of the Hudson River or\r\nthose that were to follow on the ocean. In 1806 he was sent to sea\r\nfor a year on a merchant vessel, and on his return was commissioned\r\na midshipman in the United States Navy. His service lasted for three\r\nyears, from January 1, 1808, to May, 1811, and was ended by his\r\nmarriage to the daughter of a Tory who had fought on the British side\r\nin the Revolutionary War. Then for nine years he settled down to what\r\nseemed like respectable obscurity, living part of the time at his\r\nfather-in-law's home, part of the time at Cooperstown, and the last\r\nthree years at Scarsdale, New York.\r\n\r\nFrom these first thirty years of his life there seemed to be little\r\nprospect that he was to become a novelist of world-wide and permanent\r\nreputation. There is no record that anyone, even himself, expected him\r\nto be a writer. Yet it is quite evident, as one looks back over it,\r\nthat his preparation had been rich and varied. He had lived on land and\r\non sea, in city and country, in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\r\nHe had breathed in the stories of the Revolutionary days, grown up on\r\nthe frontier, and been a part of America in the making. And from his\r\nfather, his tutor, and his wife and her family, as well as from his\r\ntravel, he had learned to see America through critical eyes. He had the\r\nmaterial to write with and the experience to make him use it wisely.\r\nThe one apparently missing factor was the most important of all--there\r\nwas not the slightest indication that he had either the will or the\r\npower to use his pen.\r\n\r\nThe story of how he began to write is a familiar one. Out of patience\r\nwith the crudity of an English society novel that he had been reading,\r\nhe said boastfully that he could write a better one himself. Many\r\nanother novel-reader and playgoer has talked with equal recklessness\r\nafter a literary disappointment in the library or the theater, but the\r\nremarkable part of the story is that in 1820 Cooper made his boast\r\ngood. The resultant novel, \"Precaution,\" was successful in only one\r\nrespect--that it started Cooper on his career. It was a colorless\r\ntale with an English plot, located in English scenes of which he had\r\nno first-hand knowledge. It made so little impression on public or\r\npublishers that when his next novel was ready, in 1821, he had to issue\r\nit at his own expense; and he made this next venture, \"The Spy,\" in\r\npart at least because of his friends' comment--characteristic of that\r\nself-conscious period--that he would have been more patriotic to write\r\non an American theme. To let Cooper tell his own story:\r\n\r\n  The writer, while he knew how much of what he had done was purely\r\n  accidental, felt the reproach to be one that, in a measure, was just.\r\n  As the only atonement in his power, he determined to inflict a second\r\n  book, whose subject should admit no cavil, not only on the world,\r\n  but on himself. He chose patriotism for his theme; and to those who\r\n  read this introduction and the book itself, it is scarcely necessary\r\n  to add that he [selected his hero] as the best illustration of his\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\nBy means of this story of war times, involving the amazing adventures\r\nof Harvey Birch, the spy, Cooper won his public; a fact which is amply\r\nproven by the sale of 3500 copies of his third novel, \"The Pioneer,\" on\r\nthe morning of publication. This story came nearer home to him, for the\r\nscenery and the people were those among whom he had lived as a boy at\r\nCooperstown. Working with this familiar material, based on the country\r\nand the developing life which was a part of his very self, Cooper wrote\r\nthe first of his famous \"Leatherstocking\" series. The five stories,\r\ntaken together, complete the long epic of the American Indian to which\r\nLongfellow was later to supply the earlier cantos in \"Hiawatha.\" For\r\nCooper took up the chronicle where Longfellow was to drop it (see p.\r\n276):\r\n\r\n            Then a darker, drearier vision\r\n          Passed before me, vague and cloud-like;\r\n          I beheld our nation scattered,\r\n          All forgetful of my counsels,\r\n          Weakened, warring with each other:\r\n          Saw the remnants of our people\r\n          Sweeping westward, wild and woful,\r\n          Like the cloud-rack of a tempest,\r\n          Like the withered leaves of Autumn.\r\n\r\nIt was not a deliberate undertaking, planned from start to finish; it\r\nwas not written in the order in which the stories occurred--like the\r\nlong series by Winston Churchill; it did not even conceive of the scout\r\nas the central character of the first book, much less of the four which\r\nwere to follow it. Cooper did not even seem to appreciate after he had\r\nwritten \"The Pioneer,\" how rich a vein he had struck, for within the\r\nnext two years he wrote \"The Pilot\" a sea story, and \"Lionel Lincoln,\r\nor the Leaguers of Boston,\" supposed to be the first of a series of\r\nthirteen colonial stories which were never carried beyond this point.\r\nHowever, in 1826 he came back to Leatherstocking in \"The Last of the\r\nMohicans,\" second both in authorship and in order of reading, and in\r\n1827 he wrote \"The Prairie,\" the last days of the scout. It was not\r\ntill 1840 and 1841 that he completed the series with the first and\r\nthird numbers, \"The Deerslayer\" and \"The Pathfinder.\" To summarize:\r\nthe stories deal in succession with Deerslayer, a young woods-man in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century; then Hawkeye, the hero of \"The\r\nLast of the Mohicans,\" a story of the French and Indian War; next,\r\nPathfinder; fourth, Leatherstocking, the hero of \"The Pioneer,\" in the\r\ndecade just before 1800; and finally, with the trapper, who in 1803\r\nleft the farming lands of New York to go westward with the emigrants\r\nwho were attracted by the new government lands of \"The Prairie.\"\r\n\r\nWith the writing of the second of the series, Cooper concluded the\r\nopening period in his authorship. In a little over six years he had\r\npublished six novels and had shown promise of all that he was to\r\naccomplish in later life. He had attempted four kinds: stories of\r\nfrontier life in which he was always successful; sea tales, for which\r\nhe was peculiarly fitted; historical novels, which he did indifferently\r\nwell; and studies in social life, in which he had started his career\r\nwith a failure but to which he returned again and again like a moth to\r\nthe flame.\r\n\r\nTo \"The Last of the Mohicans\" the verdict of time has awarded first\r\nplace in the long roster of his works. It is the one book written\r\nby Cooper that is devoted most completely to the vanishing race.\r\nThree passages set and hold the key to the story. The first is from\r\nthe author's introduction: \"Of all the tribes named in these pages,\r\nthere exist only a few half-civilized beings of the Oneidas on the\r\nreservation of their people in New York. The rest have disappeared,\r\neither from the regions in which their fathers dwelt, or altogether\r\nfrom the earth.\" The second is a speech from Chingachgook to Hawkeye\r\nin the third chapter, where they are first introduced: \"Where are the\r\nblossoms of these summers?--fallen, one by one: so all of my family\r\ndeparted, each in his turn, to the land of the spirits. I am on the\r\nhilltop, and must go down into the valley; and when Uncas follows in my\r\nfootsteps, there will no longer be any of the blood of the Sagamores,\r\nfor my boy is the last of the Mohicans.\" The third is the last speech\r\nof the book, by the sage Tamenund: \"It is enough,\" he said. \"Go,\r\nchildren of the Lenape, the anger of the Manitou is not done. Why\r\nshould Tamenund stay? The pale-faces are masters of the earth, and the\r\ntime of the red-men has not yet come again. My day has been too long.\r\nIn the morning I saw the sons of Unamis happy and strong; and yet,\r\nbefore the night has come, have I lived to see the last warrior of the\r\nwise race of the Mohicans.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years it was a habit of critics to scoff at Cooper's Indian\r\ncharacters as romantic and idealized portraits of the red man.\r\nThis judgment may have arisen during the period of Cooper's great\r\nunpopularity, when nothing was too unfair to please the American\r\npublic; but, once said, it persisted and was quoted from decade to\r\ndecade by people who cannot have read his books with any attention.\r\nIt was insisted that the woodcraft with which Cooper endowed the\r\nIndians was beyond possibility, yet later naturalists have recorded\r\ntime and again marvels quite as incredible as any in Cooper's pages.\r\nIt was reiterated that their dignity, self-control, tribal loyalty,\r\nand reverence for age were overdrawn, yet many another authority\r\nhas testified to the existence of these virtues. And, finally, it\r\nwas charged that they were never such a heroic and superior people\r\nas Cooper made them, though study of his portraits will show that\r\nCooper did not make them half as admirable as he is said to have\r\ndone. Tamenund is simply a mouthpiece; Uncas and Chingachgook are the\r\nonly living Indian characters whom he makes at all admirable, but he\r\nacknowledges the differences between their standards and the white\r\nman's in the murder and scalping of the French sentinel after he had\r\nbeen passed in safety: \"'Twould have been a cruel and inhuman act for\r\na white-skin; but 'tis the gift and natur' of an Indian, and I suppose\r\nit should not be denied.\" All the other Indians, beneath their formal\r\nways in family, camp, and council, Cooper presents as treacherous and\r\nbloodthirsty at bottom, a savage people who show their real natures\r\nin the Massacre of Fort William Henry, the chief historical event in\r\nthe book. On this ground he partly explains and partly justifies the\r\nconquest of the red men by the white.\r\n\r\nThe other people of the story are types who appear in all Cooper's\r\nnovels. Most important is the unschooled American:\r\n\r\n      He has drawn you _one_ character, though, that is new,\r\n      One wildflower he's plucked that is wet with the dew\r\n      Of this fresh Western world.\r\n\r\nHe is an out-of-door creature, intolerant of town life, skeptical of\r\nany book but the book of nature, a lover of the woods and mountains,\r\nand a worshiper of the God who made them. He has no \"theory of life\"\r\nor of government or of America, but he is just as truly a product of\r\nAmerican conditions as the mountain laurel or the goldenrod. Natty\r\nBumppo, central figure of the \"Leatherstocking\" series, is blood\r\nbrother to Harvey Birch in \"The Spy,\" to Long Tom Coffin in \"The\r\nPilot,\" to Captain Truck in \"Homeward Bound\" and \"Home as Found,\" and\r\nto a similar man in almost every one of the other stories. Quite in\r\ncontrast to this \"wildflower\" is a potted plant, of whom Cooper is\r\nalmost equally fond. This is the polished gentleman of the world, such\r\nas Montcalm, who embodies the culture and manners that the New World\r\nneeded. Cooper admired such a man almost to the point of infatuation,\r\nbut presented him very badly; he made an idea of him rather than a\r\nliving character, a veneer of manners without any solid backing,\r\nsuperficial, complacent, and hollow. One feels no affection for him and\r\nvery little respect. He annoys one by so evidently thanking God that he\r\nis not as other men. Another type is the pedant David Gamut, a man who\r\nis made grotesque by his fondness for his own narrow specialty, David,\r\na teacher of psalm-singing, bores the other characters by continually\r\n\"talking shop,\" and breaks into melody in and out of season, capping\r\nthe climax by chanting so vociferously during the massacre that the\r\nIndians regard him as a harmless lunatic and spare him then and\r\nthereafter. Dr. Sitgreaves of \"The Spy,\" and Owen Bat, the doctor of\r\n\"The Prairie,\" are struck from the same die. Finally, among the leading\r\ntypes, must be mentioned the \"females.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of this word, which sounds odd and uncouth to-day, was general\r\na hundred years ago, when \"lady\" was reserved to indicate a class\r\ndistinction, and \"woman\" had not become the common noun; but the\r\nchange is not merely one of name, for the women of books and the women\r\nof life were far less self-reliant than the women of the twentieth\r\ncentury. Then they were frankly regarded not only as dependents but as\r\ninferiors. A striking evidence of this can be found in the appropriate\r\npages in Bartlett's \"Familiar Quotations.\" The majority of the quoted\r\npassages are culled from poets who wrote before the rise of the woman's\r\nmovement, and the tone of the passages taken as a whole is distinctly\r\nsupercilious and condescending. \"Women are lovely at their best,\" the\r\npoets seemed to agree, \"but after all, they are merely--women. And at\r\nless than their best, the least said about them the better.\" Cooper\r\nwas by no means behind his time in his attitude; indeed, he was, if\r\nanything, rather ahead of it. His feeling for them seems to have been\r\nthat expressed in the famous passage from \"Marmion\" of which the first\r\nhalf is usually all that is quoted:\r\n\r\n      O woman! in our hours of ease\r\n      Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      When pain and anguish wring the brow,\r\n      A ministering angel thou!\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary situations in Cooper's novels his \"females\" were things\r\nto patronize and flatter,--for flattery never goes unattended by her\r\nsardonic companion,--but in times of stress they showed heroic powers\r\nof endurance. The three introduced in the first chapter of \"The Spy\"\r\nwere endowed, according to the text, with \"softness and affability,\"\r\n\"internal innocence and peace,\" and expressed themselves by blushes and\r\ntimid glances. The two \"lovely beings\" of \"The Last of the Mohicans\"\r\nare even more fulsomely described. \"The flush which still lingered\r\nabove the pines in the western sky was not more bright nor delicate\r\nthan the bloom\" on Alice's cheeks; and Cora was the fortunate possessor\r\nof \"a countenance that was exquisitely regular and dignified, and\r\nsurpassingly beautiful.\" In the passage that follows they are not\r\nreferred to simply, but always with a bow and a smile--\"the reluctant\r\nfair one,\" \"the dark-eyed Cora,\" and as they finally disappear on\r\nhorseback through the woods, the reader is expected not to laugh at\r\nthe final ridiculous tableau of \"the light and graceful forms of the\r\nfemales waving among the trees.\" Of course the readers to whom Cooper\r\naddressed this did not laugh. They realized that in speaking of women\r\nhe was simply using the conventional language of the day, which was\r\nnot intended to mean what it said; that he was introducing a pair of\r\nnormal, lovely girls, and that the best to be required of a normal girl\r\nwas that she should be lovely--\"only this and nothing more.\" There was\r\nno evidence that Cora and Alice had minds; they were not expected to;\r\ninstead they had warm hearts and \"female beauty.\" Lowell was probably\r\nnot unfair in his comment:\r\n\r\n      And the women he draws from one model don't vary,\r\n      All sappy as maples and flat as a prairie.\r\n\r\nBut it must be admitted that in Cooper's time the model was a\r\nprevailing one, and that it was only in his old age that women began in\r\nany large numbers to depart from it.\r\n\r\nCooper was all his life a more and more conscious observer and critic\r\nof American character and American conditions. As a result his\r\nstories take hold of the reader for the very simple reason that they\r\nare based on actual life, and real people. They had, moreover, and\r\nstill have, the added advantage that they are based on a life that\r\nwas fascinatingly unfamiliar to the great majority of his readers,\r\nand so, though realistic in their details, they exert the appeal of\r\ndistant romance. All through the eighteenth century, and particularly\r\nthrough the last third of it, literature had been inclining to dwell\r\non the joys of life in field and forest. Addison and his followers\r\nhad handed on the spell of the old ballads of primitive adventure.\r\nPope had dabbled with the \"poor Indian\" and Goldsmith had written his\r\ncelebrated line about \"Niagara's ... thundering sound.\" Collins and\r\nGray had harked back to the romantic past, and Burns and Wordsworth\r\nhad confined their poems to the peasantry among whom they lived.\r\nIrving's reply to \"English Writers on America\" (see p. 120) alluded to\r\nthe frequency of books on distant lands and peoples. So when Cooper\r\nbegan publishing his stories of adventure in untrodden lands, he found\r\nan attentive public not only in America but in England, and not only\r\nin England but all over Europe, where, as soon as his novels appeared,\r\nthey were reprinted in thirty-four different places.\r\n\r\nWith the literary asset of this invaluable material Cooper combined\r\nhis ability to tell an exciting story. There is nothing intricate or\r\nskillful about his plots as pieces of composition. In fact they seldom\r\nif ever come up to any striking finish. They do not so much conclude\r\nas die, and as a rule they \"die hard.\" They are made up of strings of\r\nexciting adventures, in which characters whom the reader likes are put\r\ninto danger and then rescued from it. \"The Last of the Mohicans\" has\r\nits best material for a conclusion in the middle of the book, with the\r\nthrilling restoration of Alice and Cora to their father's arms at Fort\r\nWilliam Henry; but the story is only half long enough at that point, so\r\nthe author separated them again by means of the massacre and carried\r\nit on more and more slowly to the required length and the deaths of\r\nCora and the last of the Mohicans. For \"The Spy,\" the last chapter was\r\nactually written, printed, and put into page form some weeks before\r\nthe latter part had even been planned. Cooper's devices for starting\r\nand ending the exciting scenes seem often commonplace, partly because\r\nso many later writers have imitated him in using them. Mark Twain,\r\nin \"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses,\" said derisively that the\r\n\"Leatherstocking Tales\" might well have been named \"The Broken Twig\"\r\nseries, because villain and hero so often discover each other as the\r\nresult of a misstep on a snapping branch. He might have substituted \"A\r\nShot Rang Out\" as his title, on account of the frequency with which\r\nepisodes are thus started or finished. Bret Harte's burlesque in his\r\n\"Condensed Novels\" shows how broadly Cooper laid his methods open to\r\nattack from the scoffers. Yet the fact remains that few who have come\r\nto scoff could have remained to rival Cooper. He has enlisted millions\r\nof readers in dozens of languages; he has fascinated them by the doings\r\nof woodsmen who were as mysteriously skillful as the town-bred Sherlock\r\nHolmes; he has thrilled by the genuine excitement of deadly struggles\r\nand hairbreadth 'scapes; and the sale of his books, a hundred years\r\nafter he first addressed the public, would gladden the heart of many a\r\nmodern novelist.\r\n\r\nAs a chapter in the literary history of America there is another side\r\nof Cooper's career which is intensely interesting. It has already been\r\nmentioned that he did not abandon the writing of novels on social life\r\nwith the unsuccessful \"Precaution.\" Lowell refers to this fact in the\r\n\"Fable for Critics\":\r\n\r\n      There is one thing in Cooper I like, too, and that is\r\n      That on manners he lectures his countrymen gratis:\r\n      Not precisely so either, because, for a rarity,\r\n      He is paid for his tickets in unpopularity.\r\n      Now he may overcharge his American pictures,\r\n      But you'll grant there's a good deal of truth in his strictures;\r\n      And I honor the man who is willing to sink\r\n      Half his present repute for the freedom to think,\r\n      And, when he has thought, be his cause strong or weak,\r\n      Will risk t'other half for the freedom to speak,\r\n      Caring naught for what vengeance the mob has in store,\r\n      Let that mob be the upper ten thousand or lower.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Cooper went abroad with his family, staying on the other side\r\nfor nearly six and a half years. His reputation was well established,\r\nand he left with the best wishes of his countrymen and the respect of\r\nthe many foreigners who knew him through his books. He was an ardent\r\nbeliever in his own land and in the theory of its government, and at\r\nthe same time he was an admirer, as he had been taught to be, of the\r\ndignity and the traditions of the Old World. It was to be expected\r\nthat he would grow wiser with travel and that his later works, while\r\nretaining all their interest as stories, would be enriched by a deeper\r\nand mellower feeling for humankind. But he had already displayed one\r\nweakness which was destined to increase in him until it almost wholly\r\noffset his virtues with his readers. He was positive to the last\r\ndegree in the opinions he held, and brutally untactful in expressing\r\nthem. If he had ever heard of the soft answer that turneth away wrath,\r\nhe felt contempt for it. Thus, for example, in the preface to \"The\r\nPioneer\" he referred to the least of authors' ills, the contradiction\r\namong critics: \"There I am, left like an ass between two locks of\r\nhay; so that I have determined to relinquish my animate nature, and\r\nremain stationary, like a lock of hay between two asses.\" The fruit\r\nof travel was naturally a more vivid sense of the differences between\r\nAmerican and European ways, a fertile crop of opinions, a belligerent\r\nassertion of them, and an unhappy series of quarrels with all sorts of\r\nAmericans--business men, editors, naval officers, congressmen, and the\r\nmajority of his readers, a vast army of representatives of the upper\r\nten thousand and the lower.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three years abroad he went on, under the headway\r\ngained at home, with three novels of American themes--one in the\r\n\"Leatherstocking\" series, one on Puritan life in New England, and one\r\nsea story. Then he went off on a side issue and sacrificed the next ten\r\nyears to controversial books which are very interesting side lights\r\non literary history but very defective novels. The whole sequence\r\nstarted with Cooper's resentment at the \"certain condescension in\r\nforeigners\" which was to make Lowell smart nearly forty years later.\r\nTo meet this, and particularly the condescension of the English, he\r\nleft the field of fiction to write \"Notions of the Americans; Picked\r\nup by a Traveling Bachelor.\" It failed of its purpose because it was\r\ntoo complacent about America and now and then too offensive about\r\nEngland, but the underlying trouble with it was its aggressive tone.\r\nA man could hardly make friends for America when he was in the temper\r\nto write of Englishmen, \"We have good reason to believe, there exists a\r\ncertain querulous class of readers who consider even the most delicate\r\nand reserved commendations of this western world as so much praise\r\nunreasonably and dishonestly abstracted from themselves.\" Cooper never\r\ncould refrain from \"the retort of abuse\" against which Irving had\r\nadvised in \"The Sketch Book.\" Then followed three novels located in\r\nVenice, Germany, and Switzerland,--\"The Bravo,\" \"The Headsman,\" and\r\n\"The Heidenmauer,\"--all designed to show how charming was Old World\r\ntradition and how mistaken was its undemocratic scheme of life. They\r\nwere failures, like \"Precaution,\" because Cooper could not write an\r\neffective novel which attempted to prove anything. It was his gift to\r\ntell a good story well and to build it out of the material in the midst\r\nof which he had grown up.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was ready to come back to America he had become kinked\r\nand querulous. The story of his controversies is too long for detailing\r\nin this chapter. The chief literary result of it is the pair of stories\r\n\"Homeward Bound\" and \"Home as Found.\" The point of them, for they\r\nagain were written to prove something, was to expose the crudities of\r\na commercialized America. There is no question that the country was\r\ncrude and raw (see pp. 111-114). A period of such rapid development was\r\nbound to produce for the time poor architecture, bad manners, shifty\r\nbusiness, superficial learning, and questionable politics. Many other\r\ncritics, home and foreign, were telling the truth about America to its\r\ngreat discomfort. Cooper's picture of Aristabulus Bragg was probably\r\nnot unfair to hundreds of his contemporaries:\r\n\r\n  This man is an epitome of all that is good and all that is bad,\r\n  in a very large class of his fellow citizens. He is quick-witted,\r\n  prompt in action, enterprising in all things in which he has\r\n  nothing to lose, but wary and cautious in all things in which he\r\n  has a real stake, and ready to turn not only his hand, but his\r\n  heart and his principles, to anything that offers an advantage.\r\n  With him, literally, \"Nothing is too high to be aspired to, nothing\r\n  too low to be done.\" He will run for governor or for town clerk,\r\n  just as opportunities occur, is expert in all the practices of his\r\n  profession, has had a quarter's dancing, with three years in the\r\n  classics, and turned his attention toward medicine and divinity,\r\n  before he finally settled down to law. Such a compound of shrewdness,\r\n  impudence, common-sense, pretension, humility, cleverness, vulgarity,\r\n  kind-heartedness, duplicity, selfishness, law-honesty, moral fraud,\r\n  and mother wit, mixed up with a smattering of learning and much\r\n  penetration in practical things, can hardly be described, as any one\r\n  of his prominent qualities is certain to be met by another quite as\r\n  obvious that is almost its converse. Mr. Bragg, in short, is purely a\r\n  creature of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Cooper's criticisms on America is not that they were\r\nunjust, but that they were so evidently ill-tempered and bad-mannered.\r\nHe made the utter mistake of locating the returning Europeans, the\r\naccusers of America, in Templeton Hall, which was the name of his own\r\ncountry place. He involved them in his own quarrel with the villagers\r\nover the use of a picnic ground belonging to him, and thus loaded on\r\nhimself all the priggishness which he ascribed to them. The public was\r\nonly too ready to take it as a personal utterance when he made one of\r\nthem say:\r\n\r\n  I should prefer the cold, dogged domination of English law, with\r\n  its fruits, the heartlessness of a sophistication without parallel,\r\n  to being trampled on by every arrant blackguard that may happen to\r\n  traverse this valley in his wanderings after dollars.\r\n\r\nIt is a misfortune that most men and women who are willing to risk\r\nrepute for the freedom to think and speak are eccentric in other\r\nrespects. They are unusual first of all in having minds so independent\r\nthat they presume to disagree with the majority even in silence. They\r\nare more unusual still in having the courage to disagree aloud. When\r\nthey have said their say, however, their neighbors begin to carp\r\nat them, respectable people to pass by on the other side, and the\r\nnewspapers to distort what they have said and then abuse them for what\r\nthey never uttered. The honest and truly reckless talkers, stung to\r\nthe quick, feel injured and innocent, talk extravagantly, rely more\r\nand more on their own judgments and less and less on the facts, and\r\nsooner or later lose their influence, if they do not become outcasts.\r\nIn the end they have the courage and honesty with which they started,\r\na few deploring friends, and a thousand enemies who hate them with an\r\nhonest and totally unjustified hatred. It is a tragic round which all\r\nbut the most extraordinary of free speakers seem doomed to travel. And\r\nCooper did not escape it. Yet he did have the remarkable strength and\r\ngood fortune to pass out of this vale of controversy toward the end of\r\nhis life. With 1842 his campaign against the public ceased--and theirs\r\nagainst him. He spent his last years happily at Cooperstown and slowly\r\nreturned into an era of good feeling. It was in these later years\r\nthat Lowell paid him the well-deserved tribute quoted above. He was\r\nreally a great patriot. If his love of America led him into this sea of\r\ntroubles, it was the same love that made him the successful writer of a\r\nmasterly series of American stories.

As a matter of fact they\r\nseem not to have had any more contact than any other three educated\r\nresidents of the city. They were not unsociable men, but each went his\r\nown social way. Until his period of controversy Cooper was leading\r\nmember of a literary club of which he had been the founder. Irving,\r\nwithout going to the pains of organizing a group, was the natural\r\ncenter of one which delighted in his company and emulated his ways of\r\nthinking and writing. Bryant, instead of being drawn after either of\r\nthese older men, stepped into journalism, becoming a friend of the\r\ngreat editors and the political leaders. Irving was the only one of the\r\nthree who was born and bred in town. Cooper and Bryant were not sons of\r\nNew York; they were among the first of its long list of eminent adopted\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nBryant (1794-1878) was born at Cummington, Massachusetts. His descent\r\ncan be traced to the earliest Plymouth families, and, on his mother's\r\nside, to Priscilla Alden. His father was a much-loved country\r\ndoctor, the third of the family in recent generations to follow\r\nthis budding profession. He was a man of dignities in his town, a\r\nstate representative and senator, and a welcome friend of the Boston\r\nbook-lovers. His services were so freely given, however, that he had\r\nlittle money to spend on his boy's education. This was carried on,\r\naccording to a common custom, under charge of clergymen, though not\r\nthe least important teaching came direct from the father's guidance\r\nof his reading and criticism of his writing. Bryant's talents began\r\nto show promise while he was still a boy, for he read eagerly, and in\r\nhis early 'teens wrote a number of \"pieces\" which were more or less\r\nwidely circulated in print. One of these, \"The Embargo,\" a political\r\nsatire addressed to President Jefferson, ran to two editions and\r\nroused so much doubt as to its authorship that his father's friends\r\nsoberly certified to it as the work of a boy of thirteen. In these\r\nyears Bryant made Alexander Pope his adored model, and for so young an\r\nimitator he succeeded remarkably well. A little later he fell under the\r\ninfluence of a group of minor Englishmen who have rather wickedly been\r\nnicknamed the \"Graveyard Poets\" because of the persistency with which\r\nthey versified on death, the grave, and the after-life. \"Thanatopsis,\"\r\nwritten before he was eighteen, was a reflection of and a response to\r\ncertain lines of Kirke White, who had deeply stirred his imagination.\r\n\r\nOnce again it was hard to persuade the literary world that young\r\nBryant was the actual author. \"Thanatopsis\" and the \"Inscription for\r\nthe Entrance to a Wood\" were published in the _North American Review_\r\nwithout signature, according to the usual custom. The editors had\r\nrequested contributions from the elder Bryant, and he had found these\r\nverses unfinished at home and had sent them on after copying them in\r\nhis own handwriting. The more famous poem so impressed the editors\r\nthat, far from believing it the work of an American boy, Richard H.\r\nDana, on hearing it read aloud, said to his colleague, \"Ah, Phillips,\r\nyou have been imposed upon; no one on this side the Atlantic is capable\r\nof writing such verses.\" In the meantime Bryant had been admitted at\r\nfifteen to the sophomore class at Williams College, had withdrawn at\r\nthe end of a year intending to enter Yale the next autumn, had been\r\nunable to carry out the plan through lack of funds, and had studied law\r\nand been admitted to the bar. While still in doubt as to his choice\r\nof profession he had written the \"Lines to a Waterfowl,\" which were\r\nlater published in the _North American_, following the acceptance\r\nof \"Thanatopsis.\" He became a lawyer not through any love of the\r\nprofession but because it seemed a reasonable way to earn a living in a\r\nperiod when one could not hope for support from his pen. He practiced\r\nfor nine years, never with any real enthusiasm, describing himself in\r\nthe midst of these years as\r\n\r\n        forced to drudge for the dregs of men,\r\n      And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen,\r\n      And mingle among the jostling crowd,\r\n      Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud.\r\n\r\nHis discontent was increased by the applause which came with his\r\nmagazine poems and by the compliment of an invitation to deliver the\r\nPhi Beta Kappa poem at Harvard in 1821. Finally, in 1825, he went down\r\nto New York in the hope of making a success of a new periodical there.\r\nIn spite of his associate editorship _The New York Review and Athenæum\r\nMagazine_ was as shortlived as scores of others. It was a bad time\r\nin America for such a venture. The country was flooded with English\r\npublications and American pirated editions of English works. The public\r\nwas not educated to the idea of magazines, nor the publishers to the\r\nmethods of financing them. They were unattractive in form and as heavy\r\nin contents as the labored name of Bryant's ill-fated experiment. After\r\nthe collapse he returned for a short time to the practice of law, but\r\nin 1826 he accepted the assistant editorship of the New York _Evening\r\nPost_, three years later became editor, and continued with it until\r\nhis death in 1878. He was the first nineteenth-century man of letters\r\nto enter the field of American journalism, and he played a highly\r\ndistinguished part in its history.\r\n\r\nWhen Bryant became editor in chief of the New York _Evening Post_ he\r\nwas thirty-five years old. He had written about one third of the\r\npoetry saved in the collected editions and about one half of the\r\nbetter-known poems on which his reputation rests. This much is worth\r\nconsidering by itself, because it has a character of its own and is\r\nquite different from the output of the latter fifty years. In the first\r\nplace it was consciously religious in tone. Bryant came from Puritan\r\nancestry. He was brought up to believe in a stern God who had doomed\r\nall mankind to eternal destruction and who ruled them relentlessly,\r\nsometimes in sorrow but more often in anger. To the Puritans life on\r\nearth was a prelude to eternity, and eternity was to be spent possibly\r\nin bliss, but probably in torment. They were truly a people \"whose\r\nminds had derived a peculiar character from the daily contemplation\r\nof superior beings and eternal interests.\" His mind and imagination\r\nwere therefore wide open to the influence of Kirke White and the\r\nother \"Graveyard Poets.\" \"Thanatopsis,\" or \"a glimpse of death,\" was\r\ncomposed under the eye of God as Bryant knew him. In setting down \"When\r\nthoughts of the last bitter hour come like a blight over thy spirit,\"\r\nhe was not indulging in any far-fetched fancy; he was alluding to what\r\nthe minister brought home to him in two sermons every Sunday and to\r\nthe unfailing subject of discussion at the mid-week prayer meeting.\r\nAnd when he wrote of approaching the grave \"sustained and soothed by\r\nan unfaltering trust,\" he was writing of a trust which needed to be\r\nespecially strong to face the thought of possible damnation.\r\n\r\nIn a broad sense all true poetry is religious, for it deals with truths\r\nthat lie beneath life and leads to higher thinking and better living,\r\nbut the religion of the youthful Bryant was specialized to a single\r\ncreed. The point is strikingly illustrated by the \"Hymn to Death.\" The\r\nfirst four fifths of this poem were written when he was twenty-five\r\nyears old, a meditation based on Puritan theology. All men die, he\r\nsaid, even those one loves; but death is really God's instrument\r\nto punish the wicked. Oppressors, idolaters, atheists, perjurers,\r\nrevelers, slanderers, the sons of violence and fraud are struck down.\r\n\r\n        Thus, from the first of time, hast thou been found\r\n      On virtue's side; the wicked, but for thee,\r\n      Had been too strong for the good; the great of earth\r\n      Had crushed the weak for ever.\r\n\r\nThen, with the poem left at this stage, Bryant's father died while\r\nstill in the height of his powers and as the result of exposure in\r\nmeeting his duties as a country doctor. In the face of this calamity\r\nthe young poet's verses seemed to him a bitter mockery:\r\n\r\n                  Shuddering I look\r\n      On what is written, yet I blot not out\r\n      The desultory numbers; let them stand,\r\n      The record of an idle revery.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the second characteristic of Bryant's earlier verse--more\r\noften than not it was self-conscious and self-applied. He wrote to \"The\r\nYellow Violet\" and devoted five stanzas to it, but ended with three\r\nmore of self-analysis. The stanzas \"To a Waterfowl\" have a general and\r\nbeautiful application, but they were pointed in his mind by the thought\r\nthat he needed aid to \"lead my steps aright\" in the choice of his\r\nlife's vocation. Even the modest autumn flower, the \"Fringed Gentian,\"\r\nreminded him of the autumn of his own life and the hope that he might\r\ndo as the flower, and look to heaven when the hour of death drew near.\r\nThis was the voice of youth which takes life as a personal matter and\r\nassumes, out of sheer inexperience, that to his concrete wants \"the\r\nconverging objects of the universe perpetually flow.\" Maturity makes\r\nthe wise man lift his eyes unto the hills whence cometh his help,\r\ninstead of continually brooding on his own hopes and fears. But this\r\nhabit of self-examination was natural not only to the young Puritan,\r\nvaguely dissatisfied with the barren existence of a country lawyer;\r\nit was closely akin to the sentimentalism of the age (see pp. 125\r\nand 148). Bryant was like many of the late eighteenth-century poets,\r\ndramatists, and novelists in his belief that quickness of emotion\r\nwas admirable in itself and that the tenderer emotions were marks of\r\nrefinement. After he had settled in the city he looked back with a\r\nglance of approval to the days when the springs of feeling were filled\r\nto the brim.\r\n\r\n      I cannot forget with what fervid devotion\r\n        I worshipped the visions of verse and of fame;\r\n      Each gaze at the glories of earth, sky, and ocean,\r\n        To my kindled emotions was wind over flame.\r\n\r\n      And deep were my musings in life's early blossom,\r\n        Mid the twilight of mountain-groves wandering long;\r\n      How thrilled my young veins, and how throbbed my full bosom,\r\n        When o'er me descended the spirit of song.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight touch of self-commendation in his continual\r\nreferences to his thrills and awes and adorations and in the\r\n\"pleasurable melancholy,\" as Poe called it, with which he enjoyed life,\r\nbut we shall see that life in the city changed this for something more\r\npositive.\r\n\r\nBefore turning away from this period, however, the student should take\r\nheed of its poetic form. The remarkable thing about \"Thanatopsis\" was\r\nnot that Bryant should have entertained the thoughts it contains or\r\nthat he should have aspired to write them, but that he expressed them\r\nin verses that were so beautiful and so different from anything ever\r\nwritten before in America. It was their form at which Dana exclaimed\r\nin his much-quoted remark to Phillips in the _North American Review_\r\noffice. When Bryant was a boy our native writers were, all but Freneau,\r\nin the habit of imitating the English poets and essayists who had set\r\nthe style a full hundred years before. The young American who felt a\r\ndrawing to literature saturated himself in the writings of Addison,\r\nPope, Goldsmith, Johnson, and their followers (see pp. 70, 93, 116,\r\netc.). The verses of these men were neat, clean-cut, and orderly, and\r\nfiled down their pages like regiments of soldiers on dress parade.\r\nThey went along in rimed pairs, with a place to draw breath near the\r\nmiddle of each line, a slight pause at the end of the first, and a\r\nfull stop at the end of the second. As a fashion, to be sure, it was\r\nno more natural than the high, powdered headdresses and hoop skirts\r\nwhich prevailed with the ladies at the same time, but it was a courtly\r\nliterary convention, and it could be acquired by any writer who was\r\npatient and painstaking. In 1785 the best that John Trumbull could hope\r\nfor America was that it might produce copyists of these Englishmen,\r\nand he expressed his hope in the usual set style--like a boy scout in\r\nuniform dreaming of the day when he and his fellows may develop into\r\nLeonard Woodses and Pershings (see p. 70). And Joseph Rodman Drake,\r\nwriting in one of the years when \"Thanatopsis\" was lying unpublished in\r\nDr. Bryant's desk, put his desire into an even more complex measure, a\r\nmodification of the Spenserian stanza (see p. 136).\r\n\r\nBryant, it will be remembered, made his first poetic flights in the\r\nstyle of Pope, and he did well enough to be apparently on the highroad\r\nof old-fashioned imitation. Then suddenly, while still a boy, he lifted\r\nhimself out of the rut of rime and began writing a free, fluent \"blank\r\nverse.\" It is the same five-stressed measure which Pope used,--the\r\nmeasure of Shakespeare too, \"If _mus_ic _be_ the _food_ of _love_, play\r\n_on_\"--but it is without rime, and the pauses come where the sense\r\ndemands instead of where the versification dictates. In the passages\r\njust cited from Trumbull and Drake there is only one line where the\r\nsense runs on without a slight pause,--the sense is forced to conform\r\nto the rhythm; but in \"Thanatopsis,\" although the rhythm is quite\r\nregular, the pauses occur at all sorts of places, and seldom at the\r\nline-ends. As Bryant set down the first seven and four-fifth lines, for\r\nexample, they read:\r\n\r\n        To him who in the love of Nature holds\r\n      Communion with her visible forms, she speaks\r\n      A various language; for his gayer hours\r\n      She has a voice of gladness, and a smile\r\n      And eloquence of beauty, and she glides\r\n      Into his darker musings, with a mild\r\n      And healing sympathy, that steals away\r\n      Their sharpness, ere he is aware;\r\n\r\nbut broken into groups, as one would read them, they fall:\r\n\r\n        To him who in the love of Nature\r\n      Holds communion with her visible forms,\r\n      She speaks a various language;\r\n      For his gayer hours she has a voice of gladness,\r\n      And a smile and eloquence of beauty,\r\n      And she glides into his darker musings,\r\n      With a mild and healing sympathy,\r\n      That steals away their sharpness, ere he is aware.\r\n\r\nThis was nothing new in poetry. Shakespeare had written his plays\r\nalmost entirely in this way, and Milton all of \"Paradise Lost\" and\r\n\"Paradise Regained,\" and the later English poets, most notably\r\nWordsworth, had just returned to it; but in America it was as\r\nunfamiliar as the \"free verse\" which is puzzling a good many readers\r\nto-day partly because it is printed in units of meaning instead of\r\nunits of measure. No wonder that Dana was surprised, \"on this side the\r\nAtlantic.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Bryant went down into the crowded activity of New York City the\r\ngeneral tone of his work began to change. The things that he was doing\r\ninterested him as the practice of law never had done. The editorship\r\nof the _Evening Post_ made him not merely a news vender but a molder\r\nof public thought, and his entrance into the world of opinion gave him\r\nmore of an interest in life itself and less in his own emotions. Very\r\nsoon he wrote the \"Hymn of the City\" to record his discovery that God\r\nlived in the town as well as in the country and that he was the God of\r\nlife quite as much as the God of death.\r\n\r\n                  Thy Spirit is around,\r\n      Quickening the restless mass that sweeps along;\r\n                  And this eternal sound--\r\n      Voices and footfalls of the numberless throng--\r\n                  Like the resounding sea,\r\n      Or like the rainy tempest, speaks of Thee.\r\n\r\nThen in \"The Battle Field\" (1837) and \"The Antiquity of Freedom\"\r\n(1842) he moved on to what was a new thought in his verse. He was\r\nstill interested in beauty, whether it were the beauty of nature or\r\nthe beauty of holiness; but as a man who had plunged into the thick of\r\nthings he became for the first time wide-awake to the idea that as the\r\nworld grows older it grows wiser and that the well-rounded life cannot\r\nbe content simply to contemplate the beauties of June, for it must also\r\nhave some part in the struggle for justice. He had grown into nothing\r\nless than a new idea of God. As a young Puritan he had felt Him to be\r\na power outside, who managed things. He had been content to pray, \"Thy\r\nwill be done on earth as it is in heaven,\" and then he had turned his\r\nback on earth and meditated about heaven. But now he aspired to do with\r\nheaven what Addison had attempted to do with \"philosophy,\" and bring\r\nit down from the clouds into the hearts of men. When he wrote, in \"The\r\nBattle Field,\" \"Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,\" he meant,\r\nas the rest of the poem shows, not the old truth of centuries but the\r\nunfamiliar truth which the new age must set on its throne.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more striking illustration of the adoption of\r\nso-called new truth than in the world's attitude toward the holding of\r\nproperty in human life. Up to the time of Bryant's birth slaveholding\r\nhad been practiced in all the United States, by the Puritans of New\r\nEngland as well as by the Cavaliers of the South. During the colonial\r\ndays in both regions the Bible had been accepted as final authority.\r\nWhat it counseled and what it did not prohibit was right, and what\r\nit condemned was wrong; and, judged on these grounds, slavery was\r\napparently sanctioned in the Bible. In spite of this, many leaders,\r\nboth North and South, protested against the practice before 1800. As\r\ntime went on, largely on account of the climate and the nature of the\r\nindustries, slavery waned in the North and thrived in the South. Then\r\nin New England the great agitation arose; but still, in Massachusetts\r\nas well as in Virginia, the men whose bank accounts were involved\r\ndefended human bondage on Scriptural grounds, protesting violently\r\nagainst\r\n\r\n                      creeds that dare to teach\r\n      What Christ and Paul refrained to preach.\r\n\r\nYet in the end the principle for which the Revolution was fought was\r\nreaffirmed in behalf of the slaves who were serving the sons of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nBryant became painfully conscious of the many issues to be fought out\r\nin the cause of liberty, and in \"The Antiquity of Freedom\" he wrote of\r\nthe eternal vigilance and the eternal conflict needed to maintain it.\r\n\r\n                                      Oh! not yet\r\n      May'st thou unbrace thy corslet, nor lay by\r\n      Thy sword; nor yet, O Freedom! close thy lids\r\n      In slumber; for thine enemy never sleeps,\r\n      And thou must watch and combat till the day\r\n      Of the new earth and heaven.\r\n\r\nThat combat is still on; the right of the subject--including woman--to\r\na voice in the government, the right of the laborer to a fair return\r\non his work, and the right of the smaller nation to undisturbed\r\nindependence are among the uppermost problems that occupy the mind of\r\nthe world to-day.\r\n\r\nLike many of his thoughtful countrymen Bryant founded his loyalty to\r\nAmerica on the hope that in this new land the seed of new truth would\r\nfall on fertile soil. In \"Earth,\" composed when he was in Italy, he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n                                O thou,\r\n      Who sittest far beyond the Atlantic deep,\r\n      Among the sources of thy glorious streams,\r\n      My native Land of Groves! a newer page\r\n      In the great record of the world is thine;\r\n      Shall it be fairer? Fear, and friendly Hope,\r\n      And Envy, watch the issue, while the lines\r\n      By which thou shalt be judged, are written down.\r\n\r\nThe number and bulk of his poems dedicated to America are not so great\r\nas those by Freneau or Whittier and Lowell or Timrod and Lanier,\r\nbut his smaller group are as distinguished and as representative\r\nas an equal number by any of the others except, possibly, Lowell.\r\nIn \"O Mother of a Mighty Race\" he alluded again to the envy and\r\nunfriendliness of the older nations, which disturbed him as it did\r\nIrving and Cooper. In the face of it he tried, with less success than\r\nIrving, to keep his own temper, taking comfort in the thought that\r\nthe downtrodden and oppressed of Europe could find shelter here and a\r\nchance to live. As a journalist he was a strong champion of Abraham\r\nLincoln long before the conservative East had given him unreserved\r\nsupport; and when the Civil War came on he sounded \"Our Country's Call\"\r\nand encouraged all within sound of his voice in \"the grim resolve to\r\nguard it well.\" During the war he wrote from time to time verses that\r\nwere full of devotion to the right and quite free from the note of hate\r\nthat poisons most war poetry; and at the end he mourned the death of\r\nLincoln no less fervently than he rejoiced at \"The Death of Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAside from these poems and others of their kind, which make the\r\nconnection between Bryant the editor and Bryant the poet, he continued\r\nto write on his old themes--nature and the individual life. There\r\nwas no complete reversal of attitude; some of the later poems were\r\nreminders of some of the earlier ones. Yet a real change came after\r\nhe had mixed with the world. At first he was inclined to lament the\r\nloss of the old life, seeming to forget how irksome it had been when\r\nhe was in the midst of it. In such personal verses as \"I cannot forget\r\nwith what fervid devotion\" and \"I broke the spell that held me long\"\r\nhe was indulging in the luxury of mild self-pity. \"In my younger days\r\nI had lots of time, but no money and few friends. Now I have friends\r\nand an income, but alas, I have no time.\" This was but a temporary\r\nmood, however. It is quite clear from his later poems that he enjoyed\r\nlife more in town than in country. This is proven by the fact that\r\nnature did not continue to suggest mournful thoughts. \"The Planting of\r\nthe Apple Tree\" is serenely recorded in \"quaint old rhymes.\" Instead\r\nof saying, as in his earlier manner: \"We plant this apple tree, but\r\nwe plant it only for a few short years. Then it will die, like all\r\nmankind. Perhaps I may be buried beneath its shade,\" he said: \"Come,\r\nlet us plant it. It will blossom and bear fruit which will be eaten in\r\ncottage and palace, here and abroad. And when it is old, perhaps its\r\naged branches will throw thin shadows on a better world than this is\r\nnow. Who knows?\" The stanzas on \"Robert of Lincoln\" are not merely free\r\nfrom sadness; they are positively jolly.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of his long career--he lived to be eighty-four--he\r\nseems at first glance to have gone back to his youthful sadness;\r\nbut this is not really the case, for thoughts which are premature\r\nor affected in youth are natural to old age. At eighty-two, in \"A\r\nLifetime\" and \"The Flood of Years\" he actually looked back over many\r\nbereavements and forward but a very short way to the life after death.\r\nThe two poems taken together are an old man's farewell to the world.\r\nLike the poem with which he won his first fame, they present another\r\nglimpse of death, but this time it is a fair prospect of\r\n\r\n      A present in whose reign no grief shall gnaw\r\n      The Heart, and never shall a tender tie\r\n      Be broken.\r\n\r\nWhen Bryant came to his seventieth birthday there was a notable\r\ncelebration at the Century Club in New York City. At that time three\r\npoems were read by three of his fellow-poets--Holmes, Lowell, and\r\nWhittier. What they said throws a great deal of light on Bryant's part\r\nin American life and literature. Holmes sang his praises as a poet of\r\nnature, a journalist of high ideals, a writer of solemn and majestic\r\nverse whose later works fulfilled the promise of his first great poem.\r\nLowell went a step farther in paying his tribute to Bryant as a poet\r\nof faith and freedom and as a citizen who gave life and courage to the\r\nnation during the crisis of the Civil War. In this respect the author\r\nof \"The Battle Field\" was quite as much of a pioneer as in his poems\r\nabout birds and flowers. He was far ahead of most of his countrymen\r\nin his feeling for America as a nation among nations--not merely in\r\nthe slightly indignant mood of \"O Mother of a Mighty Race,\" but better\r\nin his feeling that new occasions bring new duties. Finally, Whittier\r\nrevered Bryant as a man. With all admiration for his art,\r\n\r\n      His life is now his noblest strain,\r\n        His manhood better than his verse!\r\n\r\nIn his later years Bryant was one of the best citizens of New York. His\r\nstriking presence on the streets, with his white hair and beard and his\r\nfine vigor, made poetry real to the crowds who were inclined to think\r\nof it as something impersonal that existed only in books. On account\r\nof his powers as a public speaker and his place in literature he was\r\noften called on to deliver memorial addresses, and was affectionately\r\nnamed \"the old man eloquent.\" His orations on Cooper and Irving were\r\namong the first of these. His last was in 1878, at the unveiling of a\r\nstatue to the Italian patriot Mazzini. As he was returning into his\r\nhome he fell, receiving injuries from which he died shortly after.\r\nIt was fitting that his last words should have been in praise of a\r\nchampion of freedom and that he should have died with the echoes of his\r\ncountrymen's applause still ringing in his ears.\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.

For an explanation see his verses on \"The\r\nPoet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                            EDGAR ALLAN POE\r\n\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is one of the two American poets regarded\r\nwith greatest respect by authors and critics in England and on the\r\nContinent. To Whitman respect is paid because he is so essentially\r\nAmerican in his subject matter and point of view, it is yielded to\r\nPoe because his subject matter is so universal--located out of space\r\nand out of time--and because he was such a master craftsman in his\r\nart. Whitman was intensely national and local, looking on life,\r\nhowever broadly he may have seen it, always from his American vantage\r\npoint. Poe was utterly detached in his creative writing, deriving his\r\nmaturer tales and poems neither from past nor present, neither from\r\nbooks nor life, but evolving them out of his perfervid imagination\r\nand casting the best of them into incomparable form. Poe is therefore\r\nsometimes said to have been in no way related to the course of American\r\nliterature; but this judgment mistakenly overlooks his unhappily varied\r\ncareer as a magazine contributor and editor. He has a larger place in\r\nthe history of periodicals than any other American man of letters. His\r\nconnection with at least four is the most distinguished fact that can\r\nnow be adduced in their favor; and his frustrated ambition to found\r\nand conduct a monthly in \"the cause of a Pure Taste\" was a dream for a\r\nthing which his country sorely needed.\r\n\r\nPoe was born in Boston, January 19, 1809. His parents were actors--his\r\nfather a somewhat colorless professionalized amateur, his mother\r\nbrought up as the daughter of an actress and moderately successful in\r\nlight and charming rôles. By 1811 the future poet, a brother two years\r\nolder, and a sister a year younger were orphans. Each was adopted into\r\na different home--Edgar into that of Mr. John Allan, a well-to-do\r\nRichmond merchant, to whom he owed, more permanently than any other\r\ngift, his middle name. The boy was given the generous attention of an\r\nonly child. From 1815 to 1820, while his foster father's business held\r\nhim in residence across the Atlantic, he was in English schools. Then\r\nfor five years he was in a Richmond academy, and during 1825 apparently\r\nstudied under private tutors. Up to the time of his admission to the\r\nUniversity of Virginia he was handsome, charming, active-minded, and\r\nperhaps somewhat \"spoiled.\" Although only seventeen he had passed\r\nthrough a love affair culminating in an engagement, which was very\r\nnaturally broken by the father of the other contracting party.\r\n\r\nWith his year at the university Poe entered on the unfortunate\r\nsuccession of eccentricities that blighted all the rest of his\r\ntumultuous career and hastened him to an early and tragic death. He\r\ndid everything intensely, though he was methodical and industrious;\r\nbut his method was not equal to his intensity, and from time to time,\r\nwith increasing frequency, unreasoned or foolish or mad impulses\r\ncarried him off his balance and into all sorts of trouble. Thus, at\r\nthe university he stood well in his classes, but he drank to excess\r\n(and he was so constituted that a very little was too much) and he\r\nplayed cards recklessly and very badly, so that at the year's end his\r\n\"debts of honor\" amounted to over two thousand dollars. Thus again,\r\nafter a creditable year and a half in the army he had earned the office\r\nof sergeant major and had secured honorable discharge and admission\r\nto West Point, but in this coveted academy he neglected his duties\r\nand courted the dismissal which came to him within six months. Thus\r\nin one editorial position after another he met his obligations well\r\nand brilliantly until he came to the inevitable breaking point with\r\nhis less talented employers. And thus, finally, in the succession of\r\nlove affairs which preceded and followed his married life the violence\r\nof his feelings made him irresponsible and intolerable. Again and\r\nagain just at the times when he most needed full control of himself he\r\nbecame intoxicated; yet he was not an habitual drinker, and in the long\r\nintervals between his lapses he doubtless deserved from many another\r\nthe famous testimony of Nathaniel Parker Willis:\r\n\r\n  With the highest admiration for his genius, and a willingness to\r\n  let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by\r\n  common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties,\r\n  and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,\r\n  however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With his\r\n  pale, beautiful and intellectual face, as a reminder of what genius\r\n  was in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him with\r\n  deferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request that he would\r\n  not probe too deep in a criticism, or that he would erase a passage\r\n  colored too highly with his resentments against society and mankind,\r\n  he readily and courteously assented--far more yielding than most men,\r\n  we thought, on points so excusably sensitive.\r\n\r\nWillis, however, was more considerate and far more intelligent than\r\nothers, giving Poe no new ground for the \"resentments against society\r\nand mankind\" which he cherished against all too many with whom he\r\nhad differed. On the whole he was a victim not of friends or foes\r\nor \"circumstances over which he had no control\" but of the erratic\r\ntemperament with which fate had endowed him. He was like Byron and\r\nShelley in his youthful enjoyment of privilege and good fortune, in his\r\nviolent rejection of conventional ease and comfort, in his unhappy life\r\nand his early death. It is impossible to conceive that any devisable\r\nset of conditions would in the end have served Poe better. He was one\r\nof the very few who have been truly burdened with \"the eccentricities\r\nof genius.\"\r\n\r\nThe first milestone in his literary career was in 1827. Mr. Allan's\r\nrefusal to honor his gambling debts resulted in withdrawal from the\r\nuniversity and the first clear-cut break with his patron. Shortly after\r\nappeared \"Tamerlane and Other Poems. By a Bostonian. Boston: Calvin F.\r\nS. Thomas ... Printer, 1827, pp. 40.\" It was a little book in which\r\nthe passion and the pathos of his whole life were foreshadowed in the\r\nearly couplet,\r\n\r\n      Know thou the secret of a spirit\r\n        Bowed from its wild pride into shame.\r\n\r\n\"Tamerlane,\" the title poem, was a Byronic effusion without either\r\nstructure or a rational theme, but with a kind of fire glowing through\r\nin occasional gleams of poetry and flashes of power. It was the sort\r\nof thing that had already been done by the youthful Drake in \"Leon\"\r\nand that Timrod was to attempt in \"A Vision of Poesy,\" but though all\r\nthree were boyishly imitative, Poe's was the most genuine as a piece of\r\nself-revelation. This volume was followed by \"Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and\r\nMinor Poems\" in 1829, shortly before his admission to West Point, and\r\nby the \"Poems\" of 1831 just after his dismissal, each largely inclusive\r\nof what had appeared before, with omissions, changes, and some new\r\npoems but no distinctively new promise.\r\n\r\nThen for a while he settled in Richmond, receiving an allowance from\r\nMr. Allan, with whom he had experienced two estrangements and two\r\nreconciliations. In 1832 five of his prose tales were printed in\r\nthe _Philadelphia Saturday Courier_. The fruits of his unwearying\r\ndevotion to authorship began to mature in 1833, when he was awarded\r\na hundred-dollar prize for a short story in the Baltimore _Saturday\r\nVisiter_, and when the first prize for a poem in the same competition\r\nwas withheld from him only because of his success with the \"MS. Found\r\nin a Bottle.\" From then on his literary activities were interwoven with\r\nthe development of American journalism. His poems, tales, and critical\r\narticles appeared in no less than forty-seven American periodicals,\r\nfrom dailies to annuals, and he served in the editorial offices of five.\r\n\r\nFirst of these was the _Southern Literary Messenger_, with which he was\r\nconnected in Richmond, Virginia, from July, 1835, till January, 1837.\r\nThis monthly had already printed some fifteen poems and stories by Poe,\r\nand during his editorship included eleven more; but in that year and a\r\nhalf he discovered and developed his powers as a critic--powers which,\r\nthough of secondary value, had more to do with advancing his reputation\r\nand building up the _Messenger_ circulation than his creative verse\r\nand prose. He was writing in a period when abject deference to English\r\nsuperiority was giving way to a spirit of provincial puffery. In April,\r\n1836, he wrote:\r\n\r\n  We are becoming boisterous and arrogant in the pride of a too\r\n  speedily assumed literary freedom. We throw off with the most\r\n  presumptuous and unmeaning hauteur _all_ deference whatever to\r\n  foreign opinion ... we get up a hue and cry about the necessity\r\n  of encouraging native writers of merit--we blindly fancy that we\r\n  can accomplish this by indiscriminate puffing of good, bad, and\r\n  indifferent, without taking the trouble to consider, that what\r\n  we choose to denominate encouragement is thus, by its general\r\n  application, precisely the reverse. In a word, so far from being\r\n  ashamed of the many disgraceful literary failures to which our own\r\n  inordinate vanities and misapplied patriotism have lately given\r\n  birth, and so far from deeply lamenting that these daily puerilities\r\n  are of home manufacture, we adhere pertinaciously to our original\r\n  blindly conceived idea, and thus often find ourselves involved in\r\n  the gross paradox of liking a stupid book the better because, sure\r\n  enough, its stupidity is American.\r\n\r\nThe fresh honesty of this point of view was doubtless reënforced by the\r\nlocal gratification which Poe afforded a body of Southern readers in\r\nlaying low the New York Knickerbockers and worrying the complacent New\r\nEnglanders. At all events, the circulation of the _Messenger_ rose from\r\nseven hundred to five thousand during his editorship.\r\n\r\nAfter his break with the proprietor, which came suddenly and\r\nunaccountably, there was a lapse of a year and a half before he took\r\nup his duties with _Burton's Gentleman's Magazine_, continuing in a\r\nperfunctory way for about a year (July, 1839-June, 1840) when, with\r\nmuch bitter feeling, the connection was severed. In the following\r\nApril _Burton's_ was bought out and combined with Graham's feeble\r\nmonthly, _The Casket_, as _Graham's Magazine_, and Poe gave over his\r\nown design to found the _Penn Magazine_ to join forces with a new\r\nemployer. In the year that ensued he wrote and published several\r\nanalytical tales and continued his aggressive criticism, while the\r\nmagazine, under good management, ran its circulation up from eight to\r\nforty thousand. Then suddenly, in May, 1842, he was a free lance once\r\nmore, facing this time two years of duress before he secured another\r\nsalaried position, now with the _Evening Mirror_ and the tactful\r\nWillis, as a \"mechanical paragraphist.\" The months of quiet routine\r\nwith this combination daily-weekly were marked by one overshadowing\r\nevent, the burst of applause with which \"The Raven\" was greeted. It was\r\nthe literary sensation of the day, it was supplemented by the chance\r\npublication in the same month of a tale in _Godey's_ and a biographical\r\nsketch in _Graham's_, and it was reprinted in scores of papers. Such\r\ngeneral approval, dear to the heart of any artist, seems for the moment\r\nto have lifted Poe out of his usual saturnine mood. \"I send you an\r\nearly number of the _B. Journal_,\" he wrote to his friend F. W. Thomas,\r\n\"containing my 'Raven.' It was copied by Briggs, my associate, before I\r\njoined the paper. The 'Raven' has had a great 'run' ...--but I wrote it\r\nfor the express purpose of running--just as I did the 'Gold Bug,' you\r\nknow. The bird has beat the bug, though, all hollow.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to his new associate records another editorial shift.\r\nPoe's position on the _Mirror_ had been too frankly subordinate to last\r\nlong, and with the best of good feelings he changed to an associate\r\neditorship of the _Broadway Journal_ in February, 1845. With the next\r\nOctober he had realized his long-cherished ambition by obtaining\r\nfull control; yet before the year was out, for lack of money and of\r\nbusiness capacity, his house of cards had fallen and the _Journal_ was\r\na thing of the past. One more magazine contribution of major importance\r\nremained for him. This was the publication in _Godey's_, from May to\r\nOctober, 1846, of \"The Literati,\" a series of comments on thirty-eight\r\nNew York authors, done in his then well-known critical manner. His\r\nstory-writing was nearly over; \"The Cask of Amontillado\" was the only\r\nimportant one of the last half dozen, but of the twelve poems later\r\nthan the \"Raven,\" four--\"Ulalume,\" \"To Helen,\" \"Annabel Lee,\" and \"The\r\nBells\"--are among his best known.\r\n\r\nThe personal side of Poe's life after his last breach with Mr. Allan,\r\nin 1834, is largely clouded by poverty and bitterness and a relaxing\r\ngrip on his own powers. His marriage to his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in\r\n1836 was unqualifiedly happy only until the undermining of her health,\r\nthree years later, and from then on was the cause of a shattering\r\nsuccession of hopes and fears ending with her death in 1847. His\r\nrelations to most other men and women were complicated by his erratic,\r\njealous, and too often abusive behavior. Only those friendships endured\r\nwhich were built on the magnanimous tolerance or the insuperable\r\namiability of his friends and associates. His nature, which was\r\nself-centered and excitable to begin with, became perverted by mishaps\r\nof his own making until the characterization of his latest colleague\r\nwas wholly justified. Said C. F. Briggs to James Russell Lowell:\r\n\r\n  He cannot conceive of anybody's doing anything, except for his own\r\n  personal advantage; and he says, with perfect sincerity, and entire\r\n  unconsciousness of the exposition which it makes of his own mind and\r\n  heart, that he looks upon all reformers as madmen; and it is for this\r\n  reason that he is so great an egoist.... Therefore, he attributes all\r\n  the favor which Longfellow, yourself, or anybody else receives from\r\n  the world as an evidence of the ignorance of the world, and the lack\r\n  of that favor in himself he attributes to the world's malignity.\r\n\r\nUnder the accumulating distresses of his last two years the decline\r\nof will-power and self-control terminated with his tragic death in\r\nBaltimore in 1849. The gossip which pursued him all his life has\r\ncontinued relentlessly, even to the point of coloring the prejudices\r\nof his biographers,--commonly classified as \"malignants\" and\r\n\"amiables,\"--but only such facts and reports have been mentioned here\r\nas have some legitimate bearing on his habits of mind as an author.\r\n\r\nPoe was first a writer of poems, then of prose tales, and then\r\nof analytical criticisms, and one may take a cue from his famous\r\ndiscussion of the \"Raven\" by considering them in reverse order. His\r\ntheory of art can be derived from the seventy-odd articles on his\r\ncontemporaries which he printed and reprinted, from the days of the\r\n_Southern Literary Messenger_ to those of _Godey's_, and from the\r\nsummarized essays which he formulated in the three latest years. \"The\r\nPhilosophy of Composition\" and \"The Poetic Principle\" are equally well\r\nillustrated by his own poems and his comments on the poems of others.\r\nHe accepts the division of the world of mind into Intellect, which\r\nconcerns itself with Truth; Taste, which informs us of the Beautiful;\r\nand the Moral Sense, which is regardful of Duty. He defines poetry\r\nof words as \"The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. Its sole arbiter is\r\nTaste. With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral\r\nrelations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either\r\nwith Duty or with Truth.\" In the moods aroused by the contemplation\r\nof beauty man's soul is elevated most nearly to the level of God;\r\nand the privilege of Poetry--one refrains from using such a word as\r\n\"function\"--is to achieve an elevation of soul which springs from\r\nthought, feeling, and will, but which is above them all.\r\n\r\nFor the composition of poetry, thus limited in its province, he\r\ndeveloped a fairly rigid formula, a Procrustes bed on which he laid\r\nout his several contemporaries. Poems, he said, should be brief; they\r\nshould start with the adoption of a novel and vivid effect; they should\r\nbe pitched in a tone of sadness; they should avail themselves of\r\nfitting refrains; they should be presented, in point of setting, within\r\na circumscribed space; and always they should be scrupulously regardful\r\nof conventional poetic rhythms. These artistic canons are largely\r\nobserved in his poems and severely insisted on in his criticisms. He\r\nwas immensely interested in detail effects, and hardly less so in\r\nthe isolated details themselves. All the fallacious and inconsistent\r\nmetaphors of Drake's \"Culprit Fay,\" for example, by which the reader\r\nis distracted, he assembled into a final indictment of that hasty\r\npoem; and in the works of Elizabeth Barrett, of whom he was one of the\r\nearliest champions, he discussed diction, syntax, prosody, and lines of\r\ndistinguished merit in the minutest detail. Seldom in these critiques\r\ndoes he rise to the task of expounding principles, and more seldom\r\nstill does he discuss any principles of life. Always it is the cameo,\r\nthe gold filigree, the miniature on ivory under the microscope.\r\n\r\nIt is not unfair to apply his own method to him, with reference, for\r\ninstance, to poetic passages he most admired, by quoting a few of his\r\nquotations. From Anna Cora Mowatt:\r\n\r\n      Thine orbs are lustrous with a light\r\n        Which ne'er illumes the eye\r\n      Till heaven is bursting on the sight\r\n        And earth is fleeting by.\r\n\r\nFrom Fitz-Greene Halleck:\r\n\r\n      They were born of a race of funeral flowers\r\n      That garlanded in long-gone hours,\r\n        A Templar's knightly tomb.\r\n\r\nFrom Bayard Taylor:\r\n\r\n      In the red desert moulders Babylon\r\n        And the wild serpent's hiss\r\n      Echoes in Petra's palaces of stone\r\n        And waste Persepolis.\r\n\r\nFrom William Wallace:\r\n\r\n      The very dead astir within their coffined deeps.\r\n\r\nFrom Estelle Anna Lewis:\r\n\r\n                    Ætna's lava tears--\r\n      Ruins and wrecks and nameless sepulchres.\r\n\r\nAnd from Bryant the concluding familiar lines of \"Thanatopsis.\" These\r\nare the natural selections of the mind which evolved \"The Masque of the\r\nRed Death\" and \"The Cask of Amontillado\" and \"The Fall of the House of\r\nUsher.\" His readiness to indulge in a \"pleasurable melancholy\" led him\r\nto delight chiefly in the mortuary beauties of his fellow-poets.\r\n\r\nAt times, to be sure, he responded to the beauties of entire\r\ncompositions. \"Thanatopsis,\" \"To a Waterfowl,\" \"June,\" all appealed\r\nto him for the \"elevation of soul\" on which he laid critical stress,\r\nand so did poems hither and yon by others than Bryant. But for the\r\nmost part even those productions which stirred or pleased him resulted\r\nin detailed technical comments on defects of unity or structure or\r\nstyle, and for the most part what he commended was not so much ideas\r\nas poetic concepts. He could lose himself in the chromatic tints from\r\none facet of a diamond to the extent of quite forgetting the stone in\r\nits entirety. Hence it was that Poe was a poet in the limited sense of\r\none who is highly and consciously skilled in the achievement of poetic\r\neffects, but by his own definition of poetry wholly uninspired toward\r\nthe presentation of poetic truth. If the creative gift is \"to see life\r\nsteadily and to see it whole,\" Poe was as far from fulfilling the\r\nequation as mortal could be--as far, let us say, as William Blake was.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that Poe failed to appreciate or to write the kind\r\nof poetry in which he believed. It is an estimate of his own sense\r\nof values rather than for the moment of his performance. A letter to\r\nLowell written in 1844 presents the negative background against which\r\nhis theory and practice are thrown into relief.\r\n\r\n  I really perceive that vanity about which most men merely prate,--the\r\n  vanity of the human or temporal life. I live continually in a reverie\r\n  of the future. I have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that\r\n  human exertion will have no appreciable effect on humanity.... I\r\n  cannot agree to lose sight of man the individual in man the mass.--I\r\n  have no belief in spirituality. I think the word a _mere_ word....\r\n  You speak of \"an estimate of my life,\"--and, from what I have already\r\n  said, you will see that I have none to give. I have been too deeply\r\n  conscious of the mutability and evanescence of temporal things to\r\n  give any continuous effort to anything--to be consistent in anything.\r\n  My life has been _whim_--impulse--passion--a longing for solitude--a\r\n  scorn of all things present, in an earnest desire for the future.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of his own plays and poems can be fairly made only in the\r\nlight of this thing that he set out to do, a fairness of treatment, by\r\nthe way, which he often withheld from the objects of his criticism.\r\nNot to paraphrase Poe's minute analysis of \"The Raven,\" we may select\r\nthe \"Ulalume\" of a year or two later as a production which satisfies\r\nthe formula of \"The Philosophy of Composition\" and which is richer in\r\nmeaning and in self-revelation than any other. In length and tone and\r\nsubject and treatment it is according to rule. In ninety-four lines of\r\nincreasing tension the ballad of the bereaved lover is told. The effect\r\ntoward which it moves is the shocked moment of discovery that grief\r\nfor the lost love is not yet \"pleasurable,\" but on this anniversary\r\nnight is still a source of poignant bitterness. It is built around a\r\nseries of unheeded warnings--as \"The Cask of Amontillado\" is--which\r\nfall with accumulated weight when the lover's cry explains at last\r\nthe mistrusts and agonies and scruples of the pacified Psyche. The\r\neffect is intensified by use of the whole ominous first stanza in a\r\ncomplex of refrains throughout the rest of the ballad. The employment\r\nof onomatopoeia, or \"sound-sense\" words, is more subtle and more\r\neffective than in \"The Bells\" or \"The Raven\"; and the event occurs in\r\nthe usual circumscribed space--the cypress-lined alley which is blocked\r\nby the door of the tomb.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are the mere externals of the poem; the amount of\r\ndiscussion to which it has been subjected shows that, as a poem\r\nof any depth should, it contains more than meets the eye. It is a\r\nbit of life history, for it refers to Poe's own bereavement, but\r\nit is, furthermore, a piece of analysis with a general as well\r\nas a personal application. The \"I\" of the ballad is one half of a\r\ndivided personality, what, for want of a better term, may be called\r\nthe masculine element. He is self-confident, blundering, slow to\r\nperceive, perfectly brave, in his blindness to any cause for fear.\r\nPsyche, the soul, is the complementary, or feminine, element in human\r\nnature--intuitive, timid, eager for the reassurance that loquacious\r\nmale stupidity can afford her. They are the elements incarnate in\r\nMacbeth and Lady Macbeth in the early half of the play, and the\r\nstory in \"Ulalume\" is parallel to the story of Macbeth up to the\r\ntime of the murder. Yet, and here is the defect in Poe, true as the\r\nanalysis may be, in Poe's hands it becomes nothing more than that.\r\nIt is like a stage setting by Gordon Craig or Leon Bakst--very\r\nsomber, very suggestive, very artistic, but so complete an artifice\r\nthat it could never be mistaken for anything but an analogy to\r\nlife. It is, in a word, the product of one whose \"life has been\r\n_whim_--impulse--passion--a longing for solitude--a scorn of all things\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nPoe's briefer lyrics are written to a simpler formula, modified from\r\nthat for the narratives. The resemblance is mainly to be found in the\r\nscrupulous care and nicety of measure, in the adjustment of diction to\r\ncontent, and in the heightened dream tone prevailing in them. As they\r\nare not attached to any scenic background, the appeals to the mind's\r\neye are unencumbered by any obligations to continuity. Poe's technique\r\nin some of the best is quite in the manner of the twentieth-century\r\nimagists, and no less effective than in the best of these poets at\r\ntheir best. The earlier of the two poems entitled \"To Helen\" is quite\r\nmatchless in its beauty of sound and of suggestion, but it is utterly\r\nvulnerable before the kind of searching analysis to which he subjected\r\nthe verse of the luckless contemporary who stirred his critical\r\ndisapproval. One has not the slightest objective conception of what\r\n\"those Nicéan barks\" may have been nor why the beauty which attracts\r\na wanderer homeward should be likened to a ship which bears him to\r\nhis native shore. The two fine lines from Byron in the second stanza\r\nreverberate splendidly in their new setting, but again they seem to\r\nhave small likeness to the beauty of Helen. And the last pair of lovely\r\nlines are altogether beyond understanding. Read in the dream mood,\r\nhowever, which is utterly unreasonable but utterly unexacting, \"To\r\nHelen\" is as captivating as the sound of a distant melody.\r\n\r\nPoe's tales are of two very different sorts: those that are in the\r\nlikeness of his poetry and those that were done in the analytical\r\nspirit of his criticism. \"Ligeia\" is an example of the poet's work,\r\nand, indeed, includes, as some others do, one of his own lyrics, \"The\r\nConqueror Worm.\" This is cast in the misty mid-region between life and\r\ndeath, with none of the pleasures of the one except as foils to the\r\nreduplicated horrors of the other. In all the laws of construction it\r\nis one with \"The Raven\" and \"Ulalume,\" as it is also in general effect.\r\nLike the poems, too, these narratives contain no human interest, unless\r\nthis is derived from the consciousness that the \"I\" narrator is made\r\nin the image of Poe and hence is partly his spokesman,--a claim on the\r\nattention to which the stories, if considered as works of art, have no\r\ntitle. Once again these tales and poems are of the same family in the\r\ndegree to which they subordinate any kind of event to the dominant mood\r\nand in the painstaking use of every accessory that will contribute to a\r\nsense of shivery horror.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, to indulge in the type of classification that is after the\r\nmanner of Poe, a connecting group should be mentioned between the two\r\nextreme types. This includes the kind of story that substitutes the\r\nhorrors of crime and its consequences for the horrors of death, giving\r\nover any elevation of soul for the thrill derived from the malignance\r\nof fear or hatred. They deal with crime as quite distinct from sin,\r\nand when they involve conscience at all, introduce the conscience\r\nthat doth make cowards of us, rather than the voice of guidance or\r\ncorrection. Of this sort are \"The Imp of the Perverse\"--less a tale\r\nthan an essaylet with an illustrative anecdote--and \"The Black Cat\"\r\nand \"The Cask of Amontillado.\" In some ways this story of cold-blooded\r\nvengeance comes nearer than any other of Poe's tales to completely\r\nrepresenting its author's artistic designs. In the matter of its\r\ncontrivance it is cut on the pattern of \"The Raven.\" One can apply \"The\r\nPhilosophy of Composition\" by replacing each allusion to the poem with\r\na parallel from the story. Montresor, the avenger, is an incarnate\r\ndevil; Fortunato, the victim, is a piece of walking vanity not worth\r\nbothering to destroy. The slow murder is conceived during \"the supreme\r\nmadness of the carnival season,\" is pursued in a tone of grim mockery,\r\nand concluded with ironic laughter and the jingling of the fool's-cap\r\nbells. And finally, to free the tale from any least relation to life,\r\nthe assassination does \"trammel up the consequence, and catch with his\r\nsurcease, success.\"\r\n\r\nThe stories that show the mind of the critic--and the greatest of them\r\ncome in his later career--are in different fashions riddle-solutions,\r\nthe most famous being \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" \"The Mystery\r\nof Marie Roget,\" \"The Gold Bug,\" and \"The Purloined Letter,\" pioneers\r\nin the field of the detective story. In the elaboration of these Poe\r\ncombined his gift as a narrator with the powers which appeared equally\r\nin deciphering codes, discrediting Maelzel's chess player, dealing\r\nwith the complications of \"Three Sundays in a Week,\" or foreseeing the\r\noutcome of \"Barnaby Rudge\" from the opening chapter. Still, as in the\r\nearlier types, they are composed of the things that life is made of,\r\nbut themselves are uninformed with the breath of life. It has been\r\nwell said by a recent critic that the detective story is in a way a\r\nconcession to the moral sense of the reading public, following the\r\npaths of the older romance of roguery, but pursuing the wrongdoer to\r\nthe prison or the gallows instead of sharing in his defiance of the\r\nsocial order. But this concession is one in which Poe had no hand. For\r\nhim detection is an end in itself; he is like the sportsman who is\r\nstirred by the zest of the hunt and shoots to kill, but at the day's\r\nend, with fine disregard, hands over his bag to the gamekeeper. It\r\nshould be said as a last word in the classification of Poe's stories\r\nthat the best work in the threescore and ten can be found in one fourth\r\nof that number, that the remainder are in varying degrees overburdened\r\nby exposition, and that the least successful, unredeemed by technical\r\nexcellence and unanimated by any vital meaning, trail off into \"sound\r\nand fury, signifying nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAs a contemporary figure, to summarize, Poe was a vigorous agent in the\r\nupbuilding of the American magazine, a stimulator of honest critical\r\njudgment, a writer of a few poems and a few tales of the finest but\r\nthe most attenuated art. At his lowest he is a purveyor of thrills\r\nto readers of literary inexperience, people with just a shade more\r\nmaturity than the habitual matinée-goer; and at the other end of the\r\nscale he serves as a stimulant to the decadents who are weary of actual\r\nlife and real romance, whose minds are furnished like the apartment in\r\n\"The Assignation,\" in the embellishment of which \"the evident design\r\nhad been to dazzle and astound.\" At his highest, however, he has\r\nexerted an extraordinary influence not only on those who have fallen\r\ncompletely into his ways but on several prose writers of distinction\r\nwho have bettered their instructions. Wilkie Collins, Conan Doyle,\r\nStevenson, Chesterton, are only the beginning of a list, and in only\r\none language, who have taken up the detective story where Poe laid it\r\ndown. Wells and Jules Verne have developed the scientific wonder-tales.\r\nBierce, Stevenson, Kipling, Hardy, have written stories of horror\r\nand fantasy; and the touch of his art is suggested by many who have\r\nabsorbed something from it without becoming disciples or imitators of\r\nit or refiners upon it.\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  EDGAR ALLAN POE.

Indeed, by 1850, while all\r\nthis trio were living, four men in eastern Massachusetts were in full\r\ncareer,--Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, and Whittier; and before the\r\ndeath of Irving, in 1859, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Holmes came into\r\ntheir full powers. The New Yorkers had done a very distinguished work.\r\nThe two prose writers in particular had shown talents of which their\r\ncountrymen could be proud and had introduced the New World to the Old.\r\nYet, though their fame was destined to live, their influence on other\r\nauthors was bound to die with them because they both were looking\r\nbackward. The roots of these men were struck deep in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Cooper's strength lay in his ability to write stories of\r\nthe romantic past. Even when he brought them up to date, as in \"The\r\nPioneer\" and \"The Prairie,\" he presented the decline of a passing type\r\nof American life. When he wrote of the present pointing to the future,\r\nas in \"Homeward Bound\" and \"Home as Found,\" he was filled with distress\r\nand alarm. He was bred in the traditions of aristocracy; he believed\r\nin the theories of democracy, but he was very much afraid that they\r\nwould not turn out well in practice. Irving was a gentleman of the old\r\nschool. He was loyal to the ideals of his country and confident of its\r\nfuture, but he was fascinated by the traditions of England and Europe.\r\nWhen he wrote of the weaknesses of his city and his fellow-citizens he\r\ncast his gentle satires into the form made popular by two Englishmen\r\nof a bygone day, and limited himself, as they had done, to commenting\r\non customs, manners, recreations--the external habits of daily life.\r\nOf the three Bryant was the only modern man. His later life was finely\r\nadmirable; but, though his thinking was wise and just, he influenced\r\nmen less as a thinker than as a stalwart citizen. The New Yorkers, in a\r\nword, all wrote as men who were educated in the world of action; they\r\nwere almost untouched by the deeper currents of human thought which in\r\nthe nineteenth century were to make great changes in the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, the year of the fifth edition of \"The Sketch Book\" and \"The\r\nSpy\" and Bryant's first volume, there was growing up in the quieter\r\nsurroundings of Boston a generation of New England boys with a\r\ndifferent training. They all went to and through college, most of them\r\nto Harvard, and after college they set to reading philosophy. Many of\r\nthem came from a long line of Puritan ancestry, as Bryant did. Unlike\r\nBryant several of them felt a distrust and dislike for the sternness\r\nof the old creeds. Yet they had the strength of Puritan character in\r\nthem and the born habit of thinking deeply on \"the things that are not\r\nseen and eternal.\" What was new in them was that they were prepared to\r\nthink independently and to come to their own conclusions. The reading\r\nof these boys was no longer chiefly in Pope, Addison, and Goldsmith.\r\nIt was in the great English writers who were just arriving at\r\nfame--Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle--or in the French and German\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nIn the Concord group--Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne--the contrast\r\nwith the New Yorkers is particularly striking. They were anything but\r\nmen of the world. When they began to write they stayed in the seclusion\r\nof little villages and waited patiently. They matured slowly. Emerson\r\nwas past middle life before America heeded him; Hawthorne was forty-six\r\nat the time of his first marked success; Thoreau's fame did not come\r\ntill after his death. They were not \"team workers.\" Emerson was a\r\nclergyman for a short while, but retired in the very year when Bryant\r\nbegan his long service with the _Evening Post_; Hawthorne was a recluse\r\nfor fourteen years after college and then held positions reluctantly\r\nfor only half of his remaining life; Thoreau never put on the harness.\r\nThey were not swept into the current of city life,--\"warped out of\r\ntheir own orbits,\"--but, instead, they made Concord, whose \"chief\r\nproduct\" was literature, more famous than any center of shipping or\r\nbanking or manufacture.\r\n\r\n\"Concord is a little town,\" Emerson wrote in his Journal, \"and yet has\r\nits honors. We get our handful of every ton that comes to the city.\"\r\nIn his address at the two hundredth anniversary he dwelt on his pride\r\nin its history and character. He traced the earliest settlement, the\r\npartitioning of the land, the events leading up to the Revolution,\r\nand, in the presence of some of the aged survivors, the firing by the\r\nembattled farmers of \"the shot heard round the world\" in 1775. The\r\ninstitution in Concord that most appealed to him was the town meeting,\r\nwhere the whole body of voters met to transact the public business. The\r\nmeetings of those two hundred years had witnessed much that was petty,\r\nbut on the whole they had made for good.\r\n\r\n  It is the consequence of this institution that not a school-house, a\r\n  public pew, a bridge, a pound, a mill-dam hath been set up, or pulled\r\n  down, or altered, or bought, or sold, without the whole population\r\n  of this town having a voice in the affair. A general contentment is\r\n  the result. And the people truly feel that they are lords of the\r\n  soil. In every winding road, in every stone fence, in the smokes of\r\n  the poor-house chimney, in the clock on the church, they read their\r\n  own power, and consider at leisure the wisdom and error of their\r\n  judgments.\r\n\r\nEmerson noted that the English government had recently given to certain\r\nAmerican libraries copies of a splendid edition of the \"Domesday Book\"\r\nand other ancient public records of England. A suitable return gift, he\r\nthought, would be the printed records of Concord, not simply because\r\nConcord was Concord but because Concord was America. \"Tell them the\r\nUnion has twenty-four states, and Massachusetts is one. Tell them that\r\nMassachusetts has three-hundred towns, and Concord is one; that in\r\nConcord are five hundred rateable polls [that is, taxable voters] and\r\nevery one has an equal vote.\" In closing his address Emerson gave his\r\nreason for choosing when thirty-one years old to come back to \"the\r\nfields of his fathers\" and spend his life there.\r\n\r\n  I believe this town to have been the dwelling place at all times\r\n  since its planting of pious and excellent persons, who walked meekly\r\n  through the paths of common life, who served God, and loved man,\r\n  and never let go the hope of immortality. The benediction of their\r\n  prayers, and of their principles lingers around us.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal he carries this general indorsement down to particulars\r\nthat would have been out of place in a public memorial address.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps in the village we have manners to paint which the city life\r\n  does not know. Here we have Mr. S., who is man enough to turn away\r\n  the butcher, who cheats in weight, and introduces another into\r\n  town. The other neighbors couldn't take such a step.... There is\r\n  the hero who will not subscribe to the flag-staff, or the engine,\r\n  though all say it is mean. There is the man who gives his dollar,\r\n  but refuses to give his name, though all other contributors are set\r\n  down. There is Mr. H., who never loses his spirits, though always in\r\n  the minority.... Here is Mr. C., who says \"honor bright,\" and keeps\r\n  it so. Here is Mr. S., who warmly assents to whatever proposition\r\n  you please to make, and Mr. M., who roundly tells you he will have\r\n  nothing to do with the thing. Here, too, are not to be forgotten our\r\n  two companies, the Light Infantry and the Artillery, who brought up\r\n  one the Brigade Band and one the Brass Band from Boston, set the\r\n  musicians side by side under the great tree on the Common, and let\r\n  them play two tunes and jangle and drown each other, and presently\r\n  got the companies into active hustling and kicking.\r\n\r\nThus Concord was a little community with a noble and dignified past and\r\nat the same time with the homely virtues, oddities, and weaknesses of a\r\nNew England village. In these respects it was a fit dwelling place for\r\nthe man who made it famous, for they were like the town in being both\r\nfinely idealistic and very human. The contrast with the New York of\r\nthese same years is vivid (see pp. 110, 113, 190 et al.).\r\n\r\nCentering about Concord, but by no means located within it, was\r\na \"Transcendental Movement\" of which Emerson is considered the\r\nchief exponent. When the proper nouns \"Transcendentalist\" and\r\n\"Transcendentalism\" are used they are made to refer to this movement\r\nin eastern Massachusetts. In any critical sense, however, the thing\r\nthat they stood for was only an expression of world thought and was\r\none of the many out-croppings of the movement toward independence of\r\nspirit which had been developing for generations. The refusal of the\r\nnineteenth-century mind to submit to a philosophy which limited man's\r\nfaith to the knowledge derived through the senses had already brought\r\nabout in Germany, France, and England a reaction which insisted on the\r\nright of man to believe much which he could not prove. Thus developed\r\ntranscendentalism, a system of thought \"based on the assumption of\r\ncertain fundamental truths not derived from experience, not susceptible\r\nof proof, which transcend human life, and are perceived directly and\r\nintuitively by the human mind.\"\r\n\r\nThis stood in complete contrast with the faith of the Puritans and yet\r\nin strong resemblance to it. Like the Calvinists the Transcendentalists\r\nproceeded from a set of assumptions rather than a set of facts, but\r\nunlike the Calvinists the Transcendentalists drew these assumptions\r\nfrom their own inner conviction instead of from a set of dogmas which\r\nhad been distorted out of the Scriptures. They believed in God, and\r\nthey found his clearest expression in the spirit of man and in the\r\nnatural surroundings in which God had placed him. They believed that\r\nin each man was a spark of divinity. They were assailed because they\r\ndid not acknowledge an utter difference between Jesus Christ and the\r\naverage man, though their sin lay not in degrading Christ to the level\r\nof man, but in exalting man potentially to the level of Christ. They\r\ninsisted that it was the duty of each individual to develop the best\r\nthat was in him on earth, thinking more of the life here than of the\r\nlife hereafter. They were inspired by the love of God rather than\r\nthreatened by his wrath, and so they \"substituted for a dogmatic dread\r\nan illimitable hope.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for the influence of this group they inherited the sound\r\nqualities of Puritan character. They therefore did not lay themselves\r\nopen to attack on account of any wild vagaries of conduct. Emerson\r\nwas a saint, Thoreau an ascetic, Bronson Alcott a pure philosopher,\r\nTheodore Parker a great preacher and reformer, Margaret Fuller a\r\nhigh-minded woman of letters, and the scores of their associates just\r\nas devoted to a high religious ideal as any equal number of the early\r\nPilgrims.\r\n\r\nTwo undertakings chiefly focused the group activity of the\r\nTranscendentalists. The first of these was the _Dial_, a quarterly\r\npublication which ran for sixteen numbers, 1840-1844. The so-called\r\nTranscendental Club, an informal group of kindred spirits, came\r\ntoward the end of the thirties to the point where they felt the need\r\nof an \"organ\" of their own. After much discussion they undertook the\r\npublication of this journal of one hundred and twenty-eight pages\r\nto an issue. For the first two years it was under the editorship of\r\nMargaret Fuller. When her strength failed under this extra voluntary\r\ntask, Emerson, with the help of Thoreau, took charge for the remaining\r\ntwo years. Its paid circulation was very small, never reaching two\r\nhundred and fifty, and finally, when in the hands of its third set of\r\npublishers, it had to be discontinued, Emerson personally meeting the\r\nfinal small deficit. It contained chiefly essays of a philosophical\r\nnature, but included in every issue a rather rare body of verse.\r\nThe essays reflected and expounded German thought and literature\r\nand oriental thought, and discussed problems of art, literature,\r\nand philosophy. The section given to critical reviews is extremely\r\ninteresting for its quick response to the new writings which later\r\nyears have proved and accepted. Possibly the nearest analogy of to-day\r\nto the old _Dial_ is the _Hibbert Journal_,--the first journal of its\r\nkind to achieve an international circulation and self-support. _The\r\nDial_ is in a way the literary journal or diary of the Transcendental\r\nMovement in America from 1840 to 1844.\r\n\r\nThe other undertaking associated with the Transcendentalists is less\r\nformally their own venture. This was the Brook Farm Institute of\r\nAgriculture and Education in West Roxbury, nine miles out from Boston.\r\nIt was financially the undertaking of a small group of stockholders of\r\nwhom the Reverend George Ripley was the chief and Nathaniel Hawthorne\r\nthe man of widest later fame. It was an attempt at the start to combine\r\n\"plain living and high thinking,\" the theory being that the group could\r\ndo their own work and pursue their own intellectual life. During the\r\nfirst three years, from 1841 to 1844, it was carried on as a quiet\r\nassembling of idealists who were withdrawing slightly from the hubbub\r\nof the world. Agriculture was supplemented by several other simple\r\nindustries, a school was successfully maintained, and the people who\r\nlived there were viewed and visited with interest by many who looked\r\non in sympathetic amusement. The number of actual residents never\r\nexceeded one hundred and fifty. Of the leading Transcendentalists\r\nMargaret Fuller was the only one to settle. Parker was occupied with\r\nhis multitudinous duties at Boston; Thoreau attempted his own solution\r\nat Walden; Alcott was at his short-lived and ill-fated Fruitlands;\r\nand Emerson stayed in Concord with the comment: \"I do not wish to\r\nremove from my present prison to a prison a little larger.... I have\r\nnot yet conquered my own house. It irks and repents me. Shall I raise\r\nthe siege of this hen coop, and march baffled away to a pretended\r\nsiege of Babylon?\" In the latter half of its life Brook Farm was drawn\r\ninto the communistic movement which the French philosopher Charles\r\nFourier had elaborated, and was made the first \"phalanx\" in America.\r\nWith this movement its whole nature changed, as it became a part of\r\na great social project with a mission to transform the world. An\r\nambitious central building was erected in 1846, and by an irony of\r\nfate the uninsured \"phalanstery\" was burned down at the very moment\r\nwhen its completion was being celebrated. This last financial burden\r\nbroke the back of the enterprise, which was discontinued in 1847. It is\r\nsignificant of Brook Farm that however unqualified a material failure\r\nit was, it served as a gathering spot for a group of idealists who\r\nnever ceased to recall their life on the Farm as a happy and fruitful\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n     =Bibliography=\r\n\r\n       In GODDARD, H.

He came from old\r\nPuritan stock, several of his direct ancestors being clergymen. He\r\nwas one of eight children, of whom six were living when his father,\r\nthe Reverend William Emerson, died in 1811. Mr. Emerson had been so\r\nbeloved by his parishioners that they continued to pay his salary for\r\nseven years, and for three years gave the use of the parish house to\r\nthe family. The nature of these years is presented in the essay on\r\n\"Domestic Life\":\r\n\r\n  Who has not seen, and who can see unmoved, under a low roof, the\r\n  eager, blushing boys discharging as they can their household\r\n  chores, and hastening into the sitting-room to the study of\r\n  to-morrow's merciless lesson, yet stealing time to read one chapter\r\n  more of the novel hardly smuggled into the tolerance of father\r\n  and mother--atoning for the same by some passages of Plutarch or\r\n  Goldsmith; the warm sympathy with which they kindle each other\r\n  in school-yard, or barn, or wood-shed, with scraps of poetry or\r\n  song, with phrases of the last oration or mimicry of the orator;\r\n  the youthful criticism, on Sunday, of the sermons; the school\r\n  declamation, faithfully rehearsed at home.... Ah, short-sighted\r\n  students of books, of nature, and of man, too happy could they know\r\n  their advantages, they pine for freedom from that mild parental yoke;\r\n  they sigh for fine clothes, for rides, for the theatre, and premature\r\n  freedom and dissipation which others possess. Woe to them if their\r\n  wishes were crowned. The angels that dwell with them, and are weaving\r\n  laurels of life for their youthful brows, are Toil, and Want, and\r\n  Truth, and Mutual Faith.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of work for the young Emersons in the day, but\r\nthe spirit of play and playfulness survived it all, as this bit of\r\nverse shows. It was written by Ralph to his brother Edward.\r\n\r\n      So erst two brethren climb'd the cloud-capp'd hill,\r\n      Ill-fated Jack, and long-lamented Jill,\r\n      Snatched from the crystal font its lucid store,\r\n      And in full pails the precious treasure bore.\r\n      But ah, by dull forgetfulness oppress'd\r\n      (Forgive me, Edward) I've forgot the rest.\r\n\r\nIn due time Emerson went to Harvard, entering the class of 1821. Here\r\nhe earned part of his expenses and profited by scholarships, which must\r\nhave been given him more on account of his character than because of\r\nhis actual performance as a student, for he stood only in the middle\r\nof his class. He was almost hopelessly weak in mathematics, but he won\r\nthree prizes in essay-writing and declamation. He was a regular member\r\nof one of the debating societies, crossing swords with his opponents on\r\nthe vague and impossible subjects which lure the minds of youth. His\r\nappointment as class poet at graduation argues no special distinction,\r\nfor it was conferred on him after seven others had refused it. All the\r\nwhile, however, his mind had been active, and he came out from college\r\nwith the fruits of a great amount of good reading which had doubtless\r\nsomewhat distracted him from the assigned work. Emerson's experience\r\nat college should not be confused with that of many budding geniuses\r\nwho showed their originality by mere eccentricity. With Emerson, as\r\nwith Hawthorne and Thoreau too, the independence appeared simply in his\r\nchoosing the things at which he should do his hardest work. He was full\r\nof ambition. An entry in the Journal of 1822 proves that at this age he\r\nwas more like the Puritan Milton than the care-free Cooper: \"In twelve\r\ndays I shall be nineteen years old, which I count a miserable thing.\r\nHas any other educated person lived so many years and lost so many\r\ndays?\" He blamed himself for dreaming of greatness and doing little to\r\nachieve it, but he decided not yet to give up hope of belonging to the\r\n\"family of giant minds.\" Already, too, he was in thought joining his\r\nown future with the future of the country in such jottings as these.\r\n\"Let those who would pluck the lot of immortality from Fate's urn, look\r\nwell to the future of America.\" \"To America, therefore, monarchs look\r\nwith apprehension and the people with hope.\" If his countrymen could\r\nboast no great accomplishment in the arts, \"We have a government and a\r\nnational spirit that is better than persons or histories.\" The judges\r\nof his own future utterances were to be a nation of free minds, \"for in\r\nAmerica we have plucked down Fortune and set up Nature in his room.\"\r\nThese comments, of course, reveal the sentiment and the lofty rhetoric\r\nof the commencement orator, for they were all written before he was\r\ntwenty-two. In later years he wrote more simply and less excitedly, but\r\nhe never forgot that his own life was always part of the life of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe five years just after graduation were not encouraging. He taught\r\nin his brother's school for a while, but loathed it because he taught\r\nso badly. Ill-health harassed him. While he was studying in the\r\nDivinity School his eyes failed him, so that he was excused from the\r\nregular examinations at the end. And a month after he was admitted\r\nto the ministry his doctor advised him to spend the winter in the\r\nSouth. It was not until 1829, when he was twenty-six years old, that\r\nhe was settled in a pastorate. Then the future seemed assured for\r\nhim. The church was an old and respected one, the congregation made\r\nup of \"desirable\" people. If the young preacher was able to prepare\r\nacceptable sermons and make friends among his parishioners, he could\r\nbe sure of a permanent and dignified position in his native city. But\r\nalthough the flock were perfectly satisfied with their shepherd, in\r\nthree years he resigned. He had found that certain of the forms of\r\nchurch worship embarrassed him because he could not always enter into\r\nthe spirit of them. Sometimes when the moment for the \"long prayer\"\r\ncame, he did not feel moved to utter it, and he felt that to \"deliver\"\r\nit as a piece of elocution was dishonest and irreverent. Administering\r\nthe holy communion troubled him still more, because he felt afraid\r\nthat to the literal Yankee mind this symbolical ceremony was either\r\nmeaningless or tinged with superstition. So he expressed his honest\r\ndoubts to his congregation, explaining that if these features of\r\nworship were necessary he could no longer continue to be their pastor,\r\nand they reluctantly let him go.\r\n\r\nTwo years were yet to pass in the preparatory stage of Emerson's life.\r\nFor the first seven months of 1833 he was abroad, traveling slowly from\r\nItaly up to England. In reading his daily comments on what he saw, one\r\nfinds no trace of the eager zest for the novelties of travel enjoyed\r\nby Irving and Cooper; he seems rather to have gone through with the\r\ntour as a sober and conscientious process of education. His most vivid\r\nexperiences were not in seeing places but in meeting English authors,\r\nand with one of these, Thomas Carlyle, he made the beginning of a\r\nlifelong friendship. It was like Emerson to be especially attracted to\r\nCarlyle, who was almost unknown at the time, to seek him out on his\r\nlonely Scotch farm, and to feel a deeper sympathy and admiration for\r\nhim than for famous men like Wordsworth and Coleridge and De Quincey.\r\nNo single man and no amount of public opinion ever made up this young\r\nAmerican's mind for him. When, after a year of preaching and lecturing\r\nin America he went late in 1834 to settle in Concord, the richest\r\nmemory he treasured from his travel was the founding of this new\r\ncompanionship. In the fabric of the long life that remained to him no\r\ntwo threads are more important than those of Concord and Carlyle--the\r\nplace he loved most and the greatest of his friends.\r\n\r\nRightly considered, these thirty-one years are a piece not only of\r\nEmerson's life; they are a piece of American history. They exhibit\r\nthe life in Boston of a boy and young man with a fine Puritan\r\ninheritance. Among all the traits which came down to him from the\r\npast, none were more dominant than his rectitude and his independence.\r\nLike the boys of earliest Pilgrim families, he was trained at home\r\nin \"the uses of adversity,\" given a careful schooling, and sent to\r\ncollege to be prepared for the ministry. His mind, like that of his\r\nancestors, \"derived a peculiar character from the daily contemplation\r\nof superior beings and eternal interests\"; but like some of the\r\nstrongest of these--like Roger Williams, for example (p. 11), he was\r\nbent on arriving at his own conclusions. Fortunately men were no\r\nlonger persecuted for their religious beliefs in the old savage ways.\r\nEmerson's withdrawal from the pulpit did not forfeit him the love\r\nof the people whom he had been serving. Though men could still feel\r\nbitterly on the subject of religious differences, the new century was\r\nmore generous than the old had been. Travel along the Atlantic seaboard\r\nand in Europe enriched his knowledge of the world, but only deepened\r\nhis love of the home region; and here as a full-grown man he settled\r\ndown with his books and among an increasing circle of congenial friends\r\nto think about life and to record what he had thought.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore no accident that in three successive years--1836,\r\n1837, and 1838--Emerson made three statements in summary of his\r\nchief ideas on men and things. In all of them there was a central\r\nthought--that life had become too much a matter of unconsidered\r\nroutine and that people must stop long enough to make up their minds\r\nwhat it was all about. He offered no \"system.\" He pleaded only that\r\npeople begin to think again, so that if they followed in the footsteps\r\nof their fathers they should do so with their eyes open, or if they\r\ndecided to strike off into new paths they should not be blind men led\r\nby the blind.\r\n\r\nThe first of the trio[13] was the essay on \"Nature,\" published as a\r\nslender little book in 1836. He opened with an appeal for his readers\r\nto look at the wonders around them. \"If the stars should appear but\r\none night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and\r\npreserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God\r\nwhich had been shown.\" He went on to discuss nature as Commodity, or\r\nsource of all the things man may use or own; as Beauty, or source of\r\ndelight to body, spirit, and mind; as Language, or source of the images\r\nand comparisons by means of which man attempts to express abstract\r\nideas; and as a Discipline, or source of training to the intellect\r\nin understanding nature's laws and to the moral sense in obeying and\r\ninterpreting them. In all these respects he contended that the man who\r\nwill truly understand nature must combine the exactness of observation\r\nwhich belongs to science with the reverence of feeling which is the\r\nbasis of religion.\r\n\r\n  [13] Found in the volume \"Nature, Addresses and Lectures.\"\r\n\r\n  No man ever prayed heartily without learning something. But when\r\n  a faithful thinker, resolute to detach every object from personal\r\n  relations, and see it in the light of thought, shall, at the same\r\n  time, kindle science with the fire of the holiest affections, then\r\n  will God go forth anew into the creation.... So shall we come to look\r\n  at the world with new eyes.... The kingdom of man over nature, which\r\n  cometh not with observation,--a dominion such as now is beyond his\r\n  dream of God,--he shall enter into without more wonder than the blind\r\n  man feels who is gradually restored to perfect sight.\r\n\r\nSuch was Emerson's gospel of beauty. It did not attract any wide\r\nattention; but across the sea it was hailed with admiration by Carlyle,\r\nwho showed it to his friends, and it attracted the attention of Harvard\r\nCollege, so that Emerson was invited to speak before the Phi Beta Kappa\r\nsociety in the following summer.\r\n\r\nThe result of this invitation was his famous address on \"The American\r\nScholar.\" It was an appeal this time for independence in the realm\r\nof the intellect. It has frequently been described as the American\r\nDeclaration of Intellectual Independence; and the comparison to\r\nJefferson's document stands in the fact that it did not contain a new\r\nidea in America, but that it stated memorably what had been uttered\r\nagain and again by other Americans. \"Our day of dependence, our long\r\napprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The\r\nmillions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed\r\non the sere remains of foreign harvests.\" To make his point, Emerson\r\nheld that the American scholar must not continue to be \"a delegated\r\nintellect\" but must become _Man Thinking_. Unlike most of the later\r\nessays the address is clear and orderly in structure. After a brief\r\nintroduction the scholar is discussed in terms of the chief influences\r\nwhich surround him. The first is nature, and this section is brief\r\nbecause of its full treatment in the essay of the preceding year. The\r\nsecond is the spirit of the past as it is best recorded in books.\r\nEmerson accepted without qualification the books which contain the\r\nstory of history and the explanation of exact science. Yet, as science\r\nis ever advancing and the interpretations of history are continually\r\nchanging, he might have said of these what he said of books which\r\nattempt to explain life: \"Each age, it is found, must write its own\r\nbooks; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding. The books of\r\nan older period will not fit this.\" The third great influence on the\r\nscholar is participation in life.\r\n\r\n  Only so much do I know as I have lived.... If it were only for a\r\n  vocabulary, the scholar would be covetous of action. Life is our\r\n  dictionary. Years are well spent in country labors; in town; in the\r\n  insight into trades and manufactures; in frank intercourse with many\r\n  men and women; in science; in art; to the one end of mastering in\r\n  all their facts a language by which to illustrate and embody our\r\n  perceptions.... Life lies behind us as the quarry from whence we get\r\n  tiles and copestones for the masonry of to-day.\r\n\r\nWith these influences affecting him the scholar must perform his\r\nduties without thought of reward in money or praise. He must feel all\r\nconfidence in himself. \"Let him not quit his belief that a popgun is a\r\npopgun, though the ancient and honorable of the earth affirm it to be\r\nthe crack of doom.\" Signs of the interest that the scholar is showing\r\nin life (as a combination of all sorts of people with common interests\r\nbut diverse fortunes) comfort Emerson. These _will redeem_ scholarship.\r\nAnd so he concludes to the young college men:\r\n\r\n  We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we\r\n  will speak our own minds. The study of letters shall be no longer\r\n  a name for pity, for doubt, and for sensual indulgence. The dread\r\n  of man and the love of man shall be a wall of defence and a wreath\r\n  of joy around all. A nation of men will for the first time exist,\r\n  because each believes himself inspired by the divine soul which also\r\n  inspires all men.\r\n\r\nThis address was inspiring to all who heard it. The young scholars went\r\nout with a new feeling for the dignity of learning as an equipment\r\ntoward leadership, and the older Harvard professors felt in Emerson's\r\nwords some reward for a college that had helped to produce such a man\r\nas he. An immediate consequence of the address was a further invitation\r\nto speak the next year before the students of the Divinity School;\r\nand in 1838 he talked in a similar vein to the budding clergymen.\r\nThis address in a way rounded out his \"philosophy\" by applying the\r\nrule of self-reliance to the third aspect of man's life; after beauty\r\nin \"Nature\" and truth in \"The American Scholar\" came the moral sense\r\nin \"The Divinity School Address.\" He started, as in the former two,\r\nwith a kind of prose poem on the wonder of life. He went on to speak\r\nof the need of religion that was fresh, vivid, and personal. Then he\r\nreferred to the defects of \"historical Christianity,\" which was his\r\nname for the church embodiment of Christ's teaching. These, in his\r\nopinion, were two: that modern Christianity was a system of belief very\r\ndifferent from the simple teachings of Jesus and that this system was\r\ndangerous because it had become fixed. \"Men have come to speak of the\r\nrevelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead.\"\r\nThe remedy for these defects was the same as for the deadened attitude\r\ntoward Nature and Truth--that man should be self-reliant. To the\r\nyoung divinity student he declared, \"Yourself a newborn bard of the\r\nHoly Ghost, cast behind you all conformity, and acquaint men at first\r\nhand with Deity.\" Christianity has given mankind two great gifts: the\r\nSabbath and the institution of preaching.\r\n\r\n  What hinders that now, everywhere, in pulpits, in lecture-rooms,\r\n  in houses, in fields, wherever the invitation of men or your own\r\n  occasions lead you, you speak the very truth, as your life and\r\n  conscience teach it, and cheer the waiting, fainting hearts of men\r\n  with new hope and revelation?\r\n\r\nAlthough the Harvard authorities might have foreseen that he would\r\nspeak as frankly as this, they were shocked when he presumed to\r\nadvocate independence in religion. Two hundred years earlier he would\r\nhave been banished from Massachusetts for saying less. As it was,\r\nhowever, Harvard closed its lecture rooms to him for nearly thirty\r\nyears, and the conservative clergy expressed their outraged feelings\r\nin speech and print. Emerson was undisturbed. To one of them, his\r\nfriend the Reverend Henry Ware, he wrote a seldom-quoted letter that\r\ncompletely represents him. It deserves careful study.\r\n\r\n      Concord, October 8, 1838.\r\n\r\n      My dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n  I ought sooner to have acknowledged your kind letter of last week,\r\n  and the Sermon it accompanied. The latter was right manly and noble.\r\n  The Sermon, too, I have read with great attention. If it assails any\r\n  doctrines of mine--perhaps I am not so quick to see it as writers\r\n  generally--certainly I did not feel any disposition to depart from my\r\n  habitual contentment, that you should say your thought, whilst I say\r\n  mine.\r\n\r\n  I believe I must tell you what I think of my new position. It strikes\r\n  me very oddly, that good and wise men at Cambridge and Boston should\r\n  think of raising me into an object of criticism. I have always\r\n  been--from my very incapacity of methodical writing--\"a chartered\r\n  libertine\" free to worship and free to rail,--lucky when I could make\r\n  myself understood, but never esteemed near enough to the institution\r\n  and mind of society to deserve the notice of the masters of\r\n  literature and religion. I have appreciated fully the advantages of\r\n  my position; for I well know, that there is no scholar less willing\r\n  or less able to be a polemic. I could not give account of myself, if\r\n  challenged. I could not possibly give you one of the \"arguments\" you\r\n  cruelly hint at, on which any doctrine of mine stands. For I do not\r\n  know what arguments mean, in reference to any expression of thought.\r\n  I delight in telling what I think; but if you ask me how I dare say\r\n  so, or, why it is so, I am the most helpless of mortal men. I do not\r\n  even see, that either of these questions admits of an answer. So\r\n  that, in the present droll posture of my affairs, when I see myself\r\n  suddenly raised into the importance of a heretic, I am very uneasy\r\n  when I advert to the supposed duties of such a personage, who is to\r\n  make good his thesis against all comers.\r\n\r\n  I certainly shall do no such thing. I shall read what you and other\r\n  good men write, as I have always done,--glad when you speak my\r\n  thoughts, and skipping the page that has nothing for me. I shall go\r\n  on, just as before, seeing whatever I can, and telling what I see;\r\n  and, I suppose, with the same fortune that has hitherto attended\r\n  me; the joy of finding, that my abler and better brothers, who work\r\n  with the sympathy of society, loving and beloved, do now and then\r\n  unexpectedly confirm my perceptions, and find my nonsense is only\r\n  their own thought in motley.\r\n\r\n                                   And so I am,\r\n                                      Your affectionate servant,\r\n                                               Ralph Waldo Emerson.\r\n\r\nThus far it is clear that Emerson's message to the world was almost\r\nunqualifiedly personal: an attempt to shake men out of their lazy ways\r\nof drifting with the current into active swimming--with the current\r\nif they thought best, but usually against it. The whole problem was\r\nsummarized in his single defiant essay on \"Self-Reliance,\"[14]--defiant\r\nbecause in this protest he was almost entirely concerned with telling\r\nmen what they should _not_ do. They should not pray, not be consistent,\r\nnot travel, not imitate, not conform to society; but should be Godlike,\r\nindependent, searching their own hearts, and behaving in accord with\r\nthe truth they found there. It is an anarchy he was preaching, an\r\nelevated lawlessness. And the first reaction to such teaching is to\r\nask with shocked disapproval, \"What would happen to the world if all\r\nmen followed his advice?\" There are two very simple answers. The first\r\nis that if all men followed Emerson's advice, completely as he gave\r\nit, the world would be peopled with saints, for what he asked was that\r\nmen should disregard the laws of society only that they might better\r\nobserve the laws of God. And the second answer is that such a query\r\nsets an impossible condition, for the pressure of custom is so strong\r\nand the human inclination to do as others do is so prevailing that\r\ncounsel like Emerson's will never be adopted, at the most, by more than\r\na very small and courageous minority.\r\n\r\n  [14] \"Self-Reliance\" Essays, First Series.\r\n\r\nOne fact to keep in mind in reading all Emerson is that he regularly\r\nexpresses himself in emphatic terms. In consequence, what he says in\r\none mood he is likely in another to gainsay, and in a third, though\r\nwithout any deliberate intention to defend himself, he may reconcile\r\nthe apparent contradiction. He simply follows out his own ideas on\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n  But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about\r\n  this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have\r\n  stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict\r\n  yourself; what then?... A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of\r\n  little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\r\n\r\nThis sort of balancing of his views of independence is to be found in\r\nan essay of thirty years later on \"Society and Solitude.\" The first\r\ntwo thirds of this seem to be quite as unqualified as anything in the\r\nearly declarations. He quotes Swedenborg: \"There are angels who do not\r\nlive consociated, but separate, house and house; these dwell in the\r\nmidst of heaven, because they are the best of angels.\" He says for\r\nhimself: \"We pray to be conventional. But the wary Heaven takes care\r\nyou shall not be, if there is anything good in you.\" \"We sit and muse,\r\nand are serene and complete; but the moment we meet with anybody, each\r\nbecomes a fraction.\" Then, however, comes the corrective note: \"But\r\nthis banishment to the rocks and echoes no metaphysics can make right\r\nor tolerable. This result is so against nature, such a half view, that\r\nit must be corrected by a common sense and experience.\" In the earlier\r\nessays and addresses Emerson had said repeatedly that a man's education\r\ncould not be complete unless it included contact with people, and in\r\nthis essay he came round to the reverse of the medal, that no man could\r\nfully express himself who was not useful to his fellows. \"Society\r\ncannot do without cultivated men.\" This idea was, of course, always\r\nin Emerson's mind, but it was in the later years, after he himself\r\nhad seen more and more of life, that he expressed it in definite\r\nassertions instead of taking it for granted as something the wise man\r\nwould assume. The concluding paragraph in this essay not only sums up\r\nEmerson's views on society and solitude but illustrates the kind of\r\nbalance which he often strikes between statements which little minds\r\ncould erect into hobgoblins of inconsistency:\r\n\r\n  Here again, as so often, Nature delights to put us between extreme\r\n  antagonisms, and our safety is in the skill with which we keep the\r\n  diagonal line. Solitude is impracticable, and society fatal. We must\r\n  keep our head in the one and our hands in the other. The conditions\r\n  are met, if we keep our independence, yet do not lose our sympathy.\r\n  These wonderful horses need to be driven by fine hands. We require\r\n  such a solitude as shall hold us to its revelations when we are in\r\n  the street and in palaces; for most men are cowed in society, and say\r\n  good things to you in private, but will not stand to them in public.\r\n  But let us not be the victims of words. Society and solitude are\r\n  deceptive names. It is not the circumstance of seeing more or fewer\r\n  people, but the readiness of sympathy that imports; and a sound mind\r\n  will derive its principles from insight, with ever a purer ascent to\r\n  the sufficient and absolute right, and will accept society as the\r\n  natural element in which they are to be applied.\r\n\r\nThroughout the most fruitful years of Emerson's life he lived quietly\r\nin Concord, writing without hurry in the mornings, walking and talking\r\nwith his friends who lived there and with the increasing number of\r\nmore and less distinguished men who came to receive his inspiration.\r\nBut three winter months of each year he gave to lecturing, giving\r\nfrequent series in New York and Boston and going out into the West as\r\nfar as Wisconsin and Missouri. In these months, as a combined prophet\r\nand man of business, he earned a fair share of his income and exerted\r\nhis widest influence. What he meant to his auditors has been best said\r\nby Lowell in his brief essay on \"Emerson the Lecturer.\" Recalling the\r\ndays when he was a college student, sixteen years younger than Emerson,\r\nLowell wrote:\r\n\r\n  We used to walk in from the country [Cambridge, four miles out from\r\n  Boston] to the Masonic Temple (I think it was) through the crisp\r\n  winter night, and listen to that thrilling voice of his, so charged\r\n  with subtle meaning and subtle music, as shipwrecked men on a raft to\r\n  the hail of a ship that came with unhoped-for food and rescue.... And\r\n  who that saw the audience will ever forget it, where everyone still\r\n  capable of fire, or longing to renew in himself the half-forgotten\r\n  sense of it, was gathered?... I hear again that rustle of sensation,\r\n  as they turned to exchange glances over some pithier thought, some\r\n  keener flash of that humor which always played about the horizon\r\n  of his mind like heat-lightning.... To some of us that long-past\r\n  experience remains as the most marvellous and fruitful we have ever\r\n  had.... Did they say he was disconnected? So were the stars, that\r\n  seemed larger to our eyes, as we walked homeward with prouder stride\r\n  over the creaking snow. And were not _they_ knit together by a higher\r\n  logic than our mere senses could master? Were we enthusiasts? I hope\r\n  and believe we were, and am thankful to the man who made us worth\r\n  something for once in our lives. If asked what was left? what we\r\n  carried home? we should not have been careful for an answer. It would\r\n  have been enough if we had said that something beautiful had passed\r\n  that way.\r\n\r\nIf people were puzzled to follow the drift of Emerson's lectures--and\r\nthey often were--it was because most of them were so vague in outline.\r\nThey literally did drift. There were two or three explanations for\r\nthis defect. One was that Emerson seldom set himself the task of\r\n\"composing\" a complete essay. His method of writing was to put down in\r\nhis morning hours at the desk the ideas that came to him. As thoughts\r\non subjects dear to him flitted through his mind he captured some\r\nof them as they passed. These were related,--like the moon and the\r\ntides and the best times for digging clams,--but when he assembled\r\nvarious paragraphs into a lecture he took no pains to establish \"theme\r\ncoherence\" by explaining the connections that were quite clear in his\r\nown mind. It happened further, as the years went on, that in making up\r\na new discourse he would select paragraphs from earlier manuscripts,\r\nrelying on them to hang together with a confidence that was sometimes\r\nmisplaced. And auditors of his lectures in the last years recall how,\r\nas he passed from one page to the next, a look of doubt and slight\r\namusement would sometimes confess without apology to an utter lack of\r\nconnection even between the parts of a sentence.\r\n\r\nIn his sentences and his choice of words, however, there were perfect\r\nsimplicity and clearness. Here is a passage to illustrate, drawn by\r\nthe simplest of methods--opening the first volume of Emerson at hand\r\nand taking the first paragraph. It happens to be in the essay on\r\n\"Compensation.\"\r\n\r\n  Commit a crime, and the earth is made of glass. Commit a crime, and\r\n  it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground, such as reveals\r\n  in the wood the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and\r\n  mole. You cannot recall the spoken word, you cannot wipe out the\r\n  foot-track, you cannot draw up the ladder, so as to leave no inlet\r\n  or clew. Some damning circumstance always transpires. The laws\r\n  and substances of nature--water, snow, wind, gravitation--become\r\n  penalties to the thief.\r\n\r\nIn this passage of ninety words more than seventy are words of one\r\nsyllable, and only one of the other eighteen--_transpires_--can baffle\r\nthe reader or listener even for a moment. The general idea in Emerson's\r\nmind is expressed by a series of definite and picturesque comparisons.\r\n\"Be sure your sin will find you out,\" he said. \"You commit the wicked\r\ndeed, creep, dodge, run away, come to your hiding place, climb the\r\nladder, and hope for escape. But nature or God--has laid a trap for\r\nyou. Your footprints are on the new-fallen snow; human eyes follow them\r\nto the tell-tale ladder leading to your window; and you are caught. The\r\nlaws of the universe have combined against you in the snowfall, the\r\nimpress of your feet, and the weight of the ladder which you could not\r\nraise.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no great difference in the language used by Emerson\r\nand that in the paraphrase, but in the way the sentences are put\r\ntogether Emerson's method of composing is once more illustrated.\r\nEmerson suggests; the paraphrase explains. Emerson assumes that the\r\nreader is alert and knowing; the paraphraser, that he is a little\r\ninattentive and a little dull. Lowell again has summed up the whole\r\nmatter: \"A diction at once so rich and homely as his I know not where\r\nto match in these days of writing by the page; it is like home-spun\r\ncloth-of-gold. The many cannot miss the meaning, and only the few\r\ncan find it.\" This is another way of saying, \"Anybody can understand\r\nhim sentence by sentence, but the wiser the reader the more he can\r\nunderstand of the meaning as a whole.\" What is said of his prose\r\napplies in still greater degree to his poetry, as it does to all real\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nAbout his poetry, however, because common agreement has made poetry\r\nso much more dependent upon form and structure than prose, there has\r\nbeen wide disagreement, swinging all the way from the strictures of\r\nMatthew Arnold to the unqualified praise of George Edward Woodberry.\r\nOn the whole, a good deal of the argument has been beside the mark\r\nbecause it has been a condemnation of Emerson for writing in an unusual\r\nfashion rather than an appraisal of the actual value of his verse. In\r\n\"Merlin\" Emerson stated his poetic thesis and in a measure threw out\r\nhis challenge:\r\n\r\n      Thy trivial harp will never please\r\n      Or fill my craving ear;\r\n      Its chords should ring as blows the breeze,\r\n      Free, peremptory, clear.\r\n      No jingling serenader's art,\r\n      Nor tinkle of piano strings,\r\n      Can make the wild blood start\r\n      In its mystic springs.\r\n      The kingly bard\r\n      Must smite the chords rudely and hard,\r\n      As with hammer or with mace....\r\n\r\nThe natural result was that there is the closest of resemblances\r\nbetween much of Emerson's verse and some of his most elevated prose.\r\nHis prose frequently contains poetic flashes; his verse not seldom is\r\nspirited prose both in form and substance. In his Journal he sometimes\r\nwrote in prose form what with a very few changes he transcribed into\r\nverse, and in his essays there are many passages which are closely\r\nparalleled in his poems.[15] They are the poems of a philosopher whose\r\nfirst concern is with truth and whose truth is all-embracing. Emerson\r\nwrote no narratives, no dramatic poems, no formal odes, almost no poems\r\nfor special occasions, and when he did write such as the \"Concord Hymn\"\r\nhe made the occasion radiate out into all time and space when the\r\nembattled farmers \"fired the shot heard round the world.\" The utter\r\ncompactness and simplicity of his verse made it at times not only\r\nrugged but difficult of understanding. \"Brahma,\" which bewildered many\r\nof its first readers, is hard to understand only so long as one fails\r\nto realize that God is the speaker of the stanzas. The poems are like\r\nBacon's essays in their meatiness and unadornment. Had they been more\r\nstrikingly different from the ordinary measures they would probably\r\nhave been both blamed and praised more widely. Few of his poems have\r\npassed into wide currency, but many of his brief passages are quoted by\r\nspeakers who have little idea as to their source.\r\n\r\n  [15] Such abstruse poems as the following are really expounded\r\n       in corresponding essays: \"Written in Naples\" and \"Written\r\n       in Rome\"--the essay on \"History\"; \"Each and All\"--the essay\r\n       on \"Compensation\"; \"The Problem\"--the essays on \"Art\" and\r\n       \"Compensation\"; \"Merlin\"--the essay on \"The Poet\"; \"The\r\n       World-Soul\"--the essays on \"Nominalist and Realist\" and\r\n       \"The Over-Soul\"; \"Hamatreya\"--the essay on \"Compensation\";\r\n       \"Musketaquid\"--the essay on \"Nature\"; \"Étienne de la Boéce\"--the\r\n       essay on \"Friendship\"; \"Brahma\"--the essays on \"Circles\" and\r\n       \"The Over-Soul.\"\r\n\r\n      Not for all his faith can see\r\n      Would I that cowled churchman be.\r\n\r\n      Wrought in a sad sincerity.\r\n\r\n      Earth proudly wears the Parthenon\r\n      As the best gem upon her zone.\r\n\r\n        ... if eyes were made for seeing,\r\n      Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.\r\n\r\n      Oh, tenderly the haughty day\r\n        Fills his blue urn with fire!\r\n\r\nThose who are fortunate enough to have known him--he died in 1882--all\r\nagree that the real Emerson can be known only in part through his\r\nprinted pages. His life was after all his greatest work. He was serene,\r\nnoble, dignified. His portraits, at whatever age, testify to his fine\r\nloftiness. Every hearer speaks of the music of his voice. Withal he\r\nwas friendly, full of humor, a good neighbor, a loyal townsman, and\r\nan engaging host to those who were worthy of his hospitality. Charles\r\nEliot Norton, returning from Europe with him in 1873, when Emerson was\r\nsixty-nine years old, wrote in his journal: \"Emerson was the greatest\r\ntalker in the ship's company. He talked with all men, yet was fresh and\r\nzealous for talk at night. His serene sweetness, the pure whiteness\r\nof his soul, the reflection of his soul in his face, were never more\r\napparent to me.\" No single quotation nor any group of them can make\r\nreal to the young student that quiet refrain of reverent affection\r\nwhich is sounded in the recollections of scores and hundreds who knew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis almost unparalleled beauty of character is the final guarantee\r\nof the line upon line of his poetry and the precept upon precept of\r\nhis prose. What he taught must be understood partly in the light\r\nof himself and partly in the light of the years in which he was\r\nteaching. Let us take, for example, his two chief contentions. First,\r\nhis insistence that the truth can be found only by searching one's\r\nown mind and conscience. Testing this doctrine by an examination of\r\nthe man who preached it, one sees that he inherited a power to think\r\nfrom generations of educated ancestry. He had an \"inquiring mind\"\r\nand an inclination to use it. Furthermore, he inherited from this\r\nsame ancestry a complete balance of character. He did not tend to\r\nselfishness or self-indulgence, and was free from thinking that the\r\n\"voice of God\" counseled him to ignoble courses. Puritan restraint\r\nwas so ingrained in him that he needed no outward discipline and did\r\nnot see the need of it for others. Freedom for him was always liberty\r\nunder the law of right; and this freedom he championed in a period\r\nand among a people who for two centuries had been accepting without\r\nthought what the clergy had been telling them to believe. It had been\r\nfor them to do what they were told, rather than to think what they\r\nshould do. Now in Emerson's day there was a general restlessness. The\r\ndomination of the old church was relaxed, and all sorts of new creeds\r\nwere being propounded. The theory of democratic government was on\r\ntrial, and no man was quite certain of its outcome. The expansion of\r\nWestern territory and the development of the factory system were making\r\nmany quick fortunes and creating discontent with quiet and settled\r\nfrugality. Men needed to be told to keep their heads, to combine wisely\r\nbetween the old and the new, and to accept no man's judgment but their\r\nown. The \"standpatter\" would be left hopelessly behind the current of\r\nhuman thought; the wild enthusiast would just as certainly run on a\r\nsnag or be cast up on the shore.\r\n\r\nThis led to the second of Emerson's leading ideas--that a man should\r\nnot be \"warped clean out of his own orbit.\" Reasoning from the evident\r\nworking of a natural law in the universe, he was convinced that there\r\nwas a spiritual law which controlled human affairs. He was certain that\r\nin the end all would be well with the world. It was his duty and every\r\nother man's to be virtuous and to encourage virtue, but as the times\r\nwere \"in God's hand\" no man need actively fight the forces of evil. It\r\nwas the \"manifest destiny\" theory cropping out again, a belief easy\r\nto foster in a new country like America, where wickedness could be\r\nexplained on the ground that in a period of national youth temporary\r\nmistakes were sure to be committed,--and equally sure to be rectified.\r\n\"My whole philosophy,\" he said, \"is compounded of acquiescence and\r\noptimism.\" Hence there was more of sympathy than coöperation in\r\nEmerson's attitude toward life. Like Matthew Arnold in these same\r\nyears, he distrusted all machinery, even the \"machinery\" of social\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nTo some of his younger friends, and particularly to those who were more\r\nfamiliar than he with the unhappy conditions in the older European\r\nnations, Emerson's \"acquiescence and optimism\" seemed wholly mistaken.\r\nWe may return to Norton's comment (p. 215), which was unfairly\r\ninterrupted: \"But never before in intercourse with him had I been\r\nso impressed with the limits of his mind.... His optimism becomes a\r\nbigotry, and though of a nobler type than the common American conceit\r\nof the preëminent excellence of American things as they are, had\r\nhardly less of the quality of fatalism. To him this is the best of\r\nall possible worlds, and the best of all possible times. He refuses\r\nto believe in disorder or evil.\" This comment is not utterly fair to\r\nEmerson, but it represents the view of the practical idealist who feels\r\nthat for all Emerson's insistence on the value of learning from life,\r\nhe had drawn more from solitude than from society. One may quote with\r\ncaution what the pragmatic Andrew D. White said of Tolstoi:\r\n\r\n  He has had little opportunity to take part in any real discussion\r\n  of leading topics; and the result is that his opinions have been\r\n  developed without modification by any rational interchange of thought\r\n  with other men. Under such circumstances any man, no matter how\r\n  noble or gifted, having given birth to striking ideas, coddles and\r\n  pets them until they become the full-grown, spoiled children of\r\n  his brain. He can see neither spot nor blemish in them, and comes\r\n  virtually to believe himself infallible.\r\n\r\nThose who most admire Emerson to-day have perhaps as much optimism\r\nas he but very much less acquiescence. For certain vital things\r\nhave happened since he did his work. Time,--Emerson's \"little gray\r\nman,\"--who could perform the miracle of continual change in life,\r\nhas done nothing more miraculous than making men share the burden of\r\ncreating a better world. Millions are now trying to follow Emerson's\r\ninstruction to retain their independence and not to lose their\r\nsympathy, but they are going farther than he in expressing their\r\nsympathy by work. They are fighting every sort of social abuse, as\r\nEmerson's Puritan ancestors fought the devil; they are adopting\r\nEmerson's principles and Bryant's tactics; they are subscribing to\r\nWhittier's line:\r\n\r\n      O prayer and action, ye are one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n  RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

Read also his poem\r\n\"Threnody\" and the corresponding passage in the Journal for the winter\r\nof 1842.\r\n\r\nRead the essay on Goethe and see whether in Emerson's judgment of\r\nGoethe as a German national character he agrees with or dissents\r\nfrom the judgment of the twentieth century. Compare with Santayana's\r\nestimate of Goethe in \"Three Philosophical Poets.\"\r\n\r\nA sense of the ecclesiastical and theological unrest in Emerson's day\r\ncan be secured through the reading of Mrs. Stowe's \"Oldtown Folks,\"\r\nCharles Kingsley's \"Yeast,\" Anthony Trollope's \"Barchester Towers\"; or\r\nin poetry, in the poems of doubt of Arnold and Clough and Tennyson's\r\n\"In Memoriam.\"\r\n\r\nRead \"The American Scholar\" with reference to the three influences\r\nsurrounding the scholar, and then read Wells's \"The Education of Joan\r\nand Peter.\" Are there any points in common? Compare the section on\r\nBeauty in Emerson's \"Nature\" and Poe's discussion of beauty in \"The\r\nPoetic Principle\" and \"The Philosophy of Composition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                          HENRY DAVID THOREAU\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry D. Thoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1817. His\r\ngrandfather, John Thoreau, a Frenchman, had crossed to America in\r\n1773 and had married a woman of Scotch birth in 1781. His mother came\r\nfrom a Connecticut family of much earlier settlement in America, but\r\nhis more striking traits seem to have passed to him from the father's\r\nside. He was a normal, out-of-door, fun-loving boy, though with more\r\nthan average fondness for books. At Harvard, where he was a graduate\r\nin 1837, he was able but unconventional. He was more or less out of\r\npatience with the narrow limits of the course of study and the spirit\r\nof rivalry among the boys which made them work quite as much for\r\nclass ranking as for the value of what they learned. Toward the end\r\nof senior year this contempt for college honors came to a head. He\r\nhad been ill, and on his return, as the wise President Quincy put it,\r\nrevealed \"some notions concerning emulation and college rank, which had\r\na natural tendency to diminish his zeal, if not his exertions.\" When\r\nthe faculty resented this, even to the extent of planning to withdraw\r\nscholarship support, the president took up his cause and backed him for\r\nhis character rather than for his performance. It was appropriate that\r\nEmerson should have written in his young townsman's behalf, for his own\r\nexperience had not been altogether different.\r\n\r\nThe story of Thoreau's remaining years is quickly told. He lived,\r\nunmarried, a kind of care-free, independent life that in an uneducated\r\nlaboring man would be called shiftless. Many of his townsmen\r\ndisapproved of his eccentricities--his brusque manners, abrupt speech,\r\nand radical opinions, and his unwillingness to work for money unless\r\nhe had an immediate need for it. Yet he was less irregular than he was\r\nreputed to be. From 1838 to 1841 he conducted a very successful school\r\nin Concord with his brother John, giving it up only with the failure of\r\nJohn's health, and--in spite of Emerson's statement to the contrary--he\r\nhad throughout his life a hand in the family business first of\r\npencil-making and later of preparing fine plumbago for electrotyping.\r\nHowever, he was not an ordinary routine man. Like Crèvecoeur, whom he\r\nvariously suggests, he was a surveyor and a handy man with all sorts\r\nof tools. Ten years after graduation he wrote to the secretary of his\r\ncollege class:\r\n\r\n  I don't know whether mine is a profession, or a trade, or what\r\n  not.... I am a schoolmaster, a private Tutor, a Surveyor, a Gardener,\r\n  a Farmer, a Painter (I mean a House Painter), a Carpenter, a Mason,\r\n  a Day-laborer, a Pencil-maker, a Glass-paper-maker, a Writer, and\r\n  sometimes a Poetaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LITERARY MAP OF CONCORD]\r\n\r\nSo as he was able to turn an honest penny whenever he needed one, and\r\nas his needs were few, he worked at intervals and betweenwhiles shocked\r\nmany of his industrious townsfolk by spending long days talking with\r\nhis neighbors, studying the ways of plants and animals in the near-by\r\nwoods and waters, and occasionally leaving the village for trips to\r\nthe wilds of Canada, to the Maine woods, to Cape Cod, to Connecticut,\r\nand, once or twice on business, to New York City. After college he\r\nbecame a devoted disciple and friend of Emerson. From the outset\r\nEmerson delighted in his \"free and erect mind, which was capable of\r\nmaking an else solitary afternoon sunny with his simplicity and clear\r\nperception.\" They differed as good friends should, Emerson acquiescing\r\nin laws and practices which he could not approve, and Thoreau defying\r\nthem. The stock illustration is on the issue of tax-paying. Emerson,\r\nas a property-holder, paid about two hundred dollars and refused to\r\nprotest at what was probably an undue assessment. Thoreau, outraged at\r\nthe national policy in connection with the Mexican War, refused on\r\nprinciple to pay his few dollars for poll tax and had to be shut up by\r\nhis good friend, Sam Staples, collector, deputy sheriff, and jailer,\r\nwho tried in vain to lend him the money. Emerson visited him at the\r\njail, where ensued the historic exchange of questions: \"Henry, why are\r\nyou here?\" \"Waldo, why are you not here?\"\r\n\r\nThe records of the rambles of the two men are many. In his memorial\r\nessay on Thoreau, Emerson wrote:\r\n\r\n  It was a pleasure and a privilege to walk with him. He knew the\r\n  country like a fox or a bird, and passed through it as freely by\r\n  paths of his own. He knew every track in the snow or on the ground,\r\n  and what creature had taken this path before him.... On the day I\r\n  speak of he looked for the Menyanthes, detected it across the wide\r\n  pool, and on examination of its florets, decided it had been in\r\n  flower five days.\r\n\r\nEmerson's records after walks with Thoreau are full of wood lore. He\r\nmay have recognized the plants himself, but he seldom recorded them\r\nexcept when he had been with his more expert friend.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Thoreau, in company with his brother, spent \"A Week on the\r\nConcord and Merrimac Rivers,\" from which he drew the material published\r\nten years later in a volume with that title. It is a meandering record\r\nof the things he saw during the seven days and the thoughts suggested\r\nby them. In his lifetime the book was so complete a commercial failure\r\nthat after some years he took back seven hundred of the thousand copies\r\nprinted. In the meanwhile, from 1845 to 1847, he indulged in his\r\nbest-known experience--his \"hermitage\" at Walden Pond, a little way\r\nout from Concord. This gave him the subject matter for his most famous\r\nbook, \"Walden,\" published in 1854 and much more successful in point of\r\nsales. These two volumes, together with a few prose essays and a modest\r\nnumber of poems, were all that was given to the public during his\r\nlifetime. Since his death a large amount of the manuscript he left has\r\nbeen published, as shown in the list at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\"Walden\" is externally an account of the two years and two months of\r\nhis residence at the lakeside, but it is really, like his sojourn\r\nthere, a commentary and criticism on life. In the chapter on \"Where I\r\nlived and What I lived for\" he wrote:\r\n\r\n  I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front\r\n  only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what\r\n  it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not\r\n  lived.... I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\r\n  to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was\r\n  not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into\r\n  a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to\r\n  be mean, why then, to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and\r\n  publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it\r\n  by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next\r\n  excursion.\r\n\r\nThe actual report of his days by the lakeside can be separated from his\r\ndecision as to what they were worth. He went out near the end of March,\r\n1845, to a piece of land owned by Emerson on the shore of the pond.\r\nHe cut his own timber, bought a laborer's shanty for the boards and\r\nnails, during the summer put up a brick chimney, and counting sundry\r\nminor expenses secured a tight and dry--and very homely--four walls and\r\nceiling for a total cost of $28.12-1/2. Fuel he was able to cut. Food\r\nhe largely raised. His clothing bill was slight. So that his account\r\nfor the first year runs as follows:\r\n\r\n      House                         $28.12-1/2\r\n      Farm, one year                 14.72-1/2\r\n      Food, eight months              8.74\r\n      Clothing, etc., eight months    8.40-3/4\r\n      Oil, etc., eight months         2.00\r\n                                     ---------\r\n                                    $61.99-3/4\r\n\r\nTo offset these expenses he recorded:\r\n\r\n      Farm produce sold             $23.44\r\n      Earned by day labor            13.34\r\n                                    ------\r\n                                    $36.78\r\n\r\nleaving $25.21-3/4, which was about the cash in hand with which he\r\nstarted. The expense of the second year did not, of course, include the\r\nheaviest of the first-year items--the cost of the house.\r\n\r\n  I learned from my two years' experience that it would cost incredibly\r\n  little trouble to obtain one's necessary food, even in this\r\n  latitude.... In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience,\r\n  that to maintain oneself on this earth is not a hardship but a\r\n  pastime, if we will live simply and wisely; as the pursuits of the\r\n  simpler nations are still the sports of the more artificial. It is\r\n  not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his\r\n  brow, unless he sweats easier than I do.\r\n\r\nSo much for the external account of the Walden years. The last words\r\nof the quotation give a cue to the criticism with which he accompanies\r\nthe bare statement. This is contained chiefly in chapters I, \"Economy\"\r\n(the longest, amounting to one fourth of the book); II, \"Where I\r\nlived and What I lived for\"; V, \"Solitude\"; VIII, \"The Village\"; and\r\nXVIII, \"Conclusion.\" He contended that life had been made complex and\r\nburdensome because of the mistaken notion that property was much to\r\nbe desired. This idea had led men to buy land and build houses, go\r\ninto trade, construct railways and ships, and to set up government and\r\nrival governments, in order to protect the things men owned and those\r\nthey were buying and selling. Being who he was, he asserted boldly and\r\nsometimes savagely a large number of charges against organized society\r\nand the men who submitted to it. \"The laboring man has not leisure for\r\na true integrity.\" \"The civilized man's pursuits are not worthier than\r\nthe savage's.\" \"The college student obtains an ignoble and unprofitable\r\nleisure, defrauding himself.\" \"Thank God, I can sit and I can stand\r\nwithout the aid of a furniture warehouse.\" \"Men say a stitch in time\r\nsaves nine, so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine\r\nto-morrow.\" \"Society is commonly too cheap.\" \"Wherever a man goes, men\r\nwill pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they\r\ncan, constrain him to belong to their desperate, odd-fellow society.\"\r\nAt this point he challenges comparison again with Crèvecoeur (see\r\np. 60). To the hearty immigrant of the eighteenth century the common\r\nright to own the soil and to enjoy the fruits of labor seemed almost\r\nmillennial in view of the Old World conditions which denied these\r\nprivileges to the masses. To the New England townsman the ownership of\r\nproperty was oppressive in view of the aboriginal right to traverse\r\nfield and forest without any obligation to maintain an establishment\r\nor \"improve\" an acreage. In Crèvecoeur's France, where for centuries\r\nthe people had lived on sufferance, tenure of the land seemed an\r\ninestimable privilege. Thoreau's America seemed so illimitable that\r\nhe apparently supposed land would always be \"dirt cheap.\" Yet though\r\none prized property and the other despised it, they were alike in not\r\nforeseeing the economic changes that the nineteenth century was to\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe more positive side of Thoreau's criticism lies in the passages in\r\nwhich he told how excellent was his way of living, how full of freedom\r\nand leisure and how blest with solitude. There is no question that he\r\ndid live cheaply, easily, happily, and independently, nor is there\r\nany question that the love of money and what it represents has made\r\nlife more of a burden than a joy for millions of people; but there is\r\nthis immense difference between the independence of Thoreau and the\r\nindependence of Emerson--that Emerson discharged his duties in the\r\nfamily and in the state and that Thoreau protested at his obligations\r\nto the group even while he was reaping the benefits of other men's\r\nindustry. At Walden he lived on land owned by Emerson, who bought it\r\nand paid the taxes on it. The bricks and glass and nails in his shanty\r\nand the tools he borrowed to build it with were the products of mines\r\nand factories and kilns brought to him on the railroads and handled by\r\nthe shopkeepers whom he scorned. He was therefore in the ungraceful\r\nposition of being a beneficiary of society while he was carrying on a\r\nkind of guerrilla warfare against it.\r\n\r\nAs a citizen and as a critic of society Thoreau lacked the sturdy\r\nPuritan conscience which is the bone and sinew of Emerson's character,\r\nand he lacked the \"high seriousness\" of his greater townsman. In\r\nconsequence, instead of being serenely self-reliant he was often\r\npetulant; and instead of being nobly dignified he was nervously on\r\nguard against deserved rebuke. Emerson frequently uttered and wrote\r\nstriking sentences which surprise one into pleased attention, Thoreau\r\ncame out with smart and clever sayings like an eager and half-naughty\r\nboy who is trying to shock his elders. Almost the only rejoinder that\r\nhis protests called forth must have been disturbing to him, because\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes was so unruffled as he wrote his \"Contentment.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is an interesting argument from a well-meaning young man,\" Holmes\r\nseems to have said:\r\n\r\n      Little _I_ ask, _my_ wants are few;\r\n\r\nand then in playful satire he told about the hut--of stone--on Beacon\r\nStreet that fronts the sun, where he too could live content with a\r\nwell-set table, the best of clothes, furniture, jewelry, paintings, and\r\na fast horse when he chose to take an airing. This was the attitude of\r\nmany good-humored men and women of the world who were inclined to smile\r\nindulgently at whatever came out of Concord.\r\n\r\nHowever, a fair estimate of Thoreau and his case against the world\r\nshould steer the wise course between taking him too seriously and\r\nliterally and not taking him seriously at all, between Stevenson's\r\nscathing attack in \"Familiar Portraits\" and Holmes's supercilious\r\n\"Contentment.\" If one elects to act as a prosecuting attorney, one can\r\nsay of him what Thoreau quotes a friend as saying of Carlyle, that he\r\n\"is so ready to obey his humour that he makes the least vestige of\r\ntruth the foundation of any superstructure, not keeping faith with his\r\nbetter genius nor truest readers.\" But if one choose to value him as a\r\nfriend might, one can exonerate him in the light of a warning and a\r\nconfession of his own: \"I trust that you realize what an exaggerator\r\nI am,--that I lay myself out to exaggerate whenever I have an\r\nopportunity,--pile Pelion upon Ossa, to reach heaven so.\" This is the\r\nvery point of his title-page inscription to \"Walden\": \"I do not propose\r\nto write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in\r\nthe morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up.\"\r\nIt is easy to compare Emerson and Thoreau to the disadvantage of the\r\nyounger man. But at one point they were quite alike, and that is in the\r\nfact that both were more social in their lives than in their writings.\r\nThoreau was not an unmitigated anarchist, or hermit, or loafer. He was\r\nmore capable and industrious than he admits; he was devoted to his\r\nfamily and a loyal friend. In his protest at the ways of the world\r\nhe was, in a manner, \"whistling to keep his courage up,\" and often\r\nhis whistling became rather shrill. The greater part of \"Walden\" and,\r\nindeed, of his writing as a whole is the work of a naturalist--the work\r\nincluded in such chapters as \"Sounds,\" \"The Ponds,\" \"Brute Neighbors,\"\r\n\"Former Inhabitants,\" and \"Winter Visitors,\" \"Winter Animals,\" and \"The\r\nPond in Winter.\" In the two generations since Crèvecoeur's \"Letters\r\nfrom an American Farmer\" no one on this side the Atlantic had written\r\nabout the out of doors with such fullness and intimate knowledge. In\r\nthis respect, moreover, Thoreau, instead of being a student or imitator\r\nof Emerson, was his guide and instructor. Although modern science owes\r\nlittle to him and has corrected many of his findings, it recalls his\r\nhelp to Agassiz in collecting specimens; and modern literature has\r\nproduced only one or two men, like John Burroughs and John Muir, who\r\nwrite of nature with the same sympathy and beauty. The title of his\r\nfriend Channing's book \"Thoreau: the Poet-Naturalist\" tells the whole\r\nstory. He was fascinated by growing things. He could not learn enough\r\nabout their ways. The life in Concord's rivers, ponds, fields, and\r\nwoods by day and night and during the changing seasons was an endless\r\nstudy and pleasure. In his journal he kept a detailed record of the\r\npageant of the year, which after his death was assembled in the four\r\nvolumes \"Spring in Massachusetts,\" \"Summer,\" \"Autumn,\" and \"Winter.\"\r\nWhen he went to other parts of the country he carried his knowledge of\r\nConcord as a sort of reference book. From Staten Island he wrote: \"The\r\nwoods are now full of a large honeysuckle in full bloom, which differs\r\nfrom ours.... Things are very forward here compared with Concord.\" In\r\nthe Maine woods he recognized his old familiars but in more massively\r\nprimitive surroundings than those at home. The sandy aridity of\r\nCape Cod furnished him daily with fascinating contrasts, in natural\r\nsurroundings and in their effect on the residents. On his trip to Mount\r\nWashington he found forty-two of the forty-six plants he expected,\r\nadding one to his list when, after falling and spraining his ankle, he\r\nlimped a few steps and said, \"Here is the arnica, anyhow,\" reaching for\r\nan _arnica mollis_, which he had not found before. And when he chose\r\nto put into essay form some of the information he had gleaned, he was\r\nexact without being technical and never for long repressed his lively\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nThe poet in him brought him back continually to the beauty in what he\r\nsaw. He did not particularly incline to philosophize about creation\r\nlike Emerson, the sheer facts of it meant so much more to him. Nor did\r\nhe care to expound the beauties of nature; he simply held them up to\r\nview. Take, for example, this bit from \"The Pond in Winter,\" in which\r\nthe last twelve words are quite as beautiful as the thing they describe:\r\n\r\n  Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the\r\n  hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot\r\n  of ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink,\r\n  I look down into the quiet parlor of fishes, pervaded by a softened\r\n  light as through a window of ground glass, with its bright sanded\r\n  floor the same as in summer; there a perennial waveless serenity\r\n  reigns as in the amber, twilight sky.\r\n\r\nOr, again, this prose poem quoted in Channing's book:\r\n\r\n  One more confiding heifer, the fairest of the herd, did by degrees\r\n  approach as if to take some morsel from our hands, while our hearts\r\n  leaped to our mouths with expectation and delight. She by degrees\r\n  drew near with her fair limbs (progressive), making pretence of\r\n  browsing; nearer and nearer, till there was wafted to us the bovine\r\n  fragrance,--cream of all the dairies that ever were or will be: and\r\n  then she raised her gentle muzzle toward us, and snuffed an honest\r\n  recognition within hand's reach. I saw it was possible for his herd\r\n  to inspire with love the herdsman. She was as delicately featured\r\n  as a hind. Her hide was mingled white and fawn-color, and on her\r\n  muzzle's tip there was a white spot not bigger than a daisy; and on\r\n  her side turned toward me, the map of Asia plain to see.\r\n\r\nThe following passages fulfill the main tenets of the contemporary\r\nImagists:\r\n\r\n  I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud,\r\n  or than Walden pond itself. What company has that lonely lake, I\r\n  pray?... I am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a\r\n  pasture, or a bean-leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumble-bee.\r\n  I am no more lonely than the Mill Brook, or a weather-cock, or the\r\n  north star, or the south wind, or an April shower, or a January thaw,\r\n  or the first spider in a new house.\r\n\r\n  The wind has gently murmured through the blinds, or puffed with\r\n  feathery softness against the windows, and occasionally sighed like\r\n  a summer zephyr, lifting the leaves along, the livelong night. The\r\n  meadow-mouse has slept in his snug gallery in the sod, the owl has\r\n  sat in a hollow tree in the depth of the swamp; the rabbit, the\r\n  squirrel and the fox have all been housed. The watch-dog has lain\r\n  quiet on the hearth, and the cattle have stood silent in their\r\n  stalls.... But while the earth has slumbered, all the air has been\r\n  alive with feathery flakes descending, as if some northern Ceres\r\n  reigned, showering her silvery grain over all the fields.\r\n\r\n  No yard; but unfenced Nature reaching to your very sills. A young\r\n  forest growing up under your windows, and wild sumachs and blackberry\r\n  vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy pitch-pines rubbing\r\n  and creaking against the shingles for want of room, their roots\r\n  reaching quite under the house. Instead of a scuttle or a blind blown\r\n  off in the gale,--a pine tree torn up by the roots behind your house\r\n  for fuel. Instead of no path to the front-yard gate in the Great\r\n  Snow,--no gate--no front yard, and no path to the civilized world.\r\n\r\nHis manner of writing was so like Emerson's that the comments on the\r\nstyle of the elder man (see pp. 212-215) apply for the most part to\r\nthat of the younger.\r\n\r\nFrom the year of \"Walden's\" appearance to the end of Thoreau's life, in\r\n1862, three matters are specially worthy of record. The first is that\r\nrecognition began at last to come. This probably did not hasten his\r\nwriting, but it released some of the great accumulation of manuscript\r\nin his possession. Several of the magazines accepted his papers,\r\nnotably _The Atlantic Monthly_, which took eight of his articles,\r\nalthough seven of them were not published until the two years just\r\nafter his death. The second is his eager friendship for two of the most\r\nstrikingly unconventional men of his day--Walt Whitman and John Brown\r\n\"of Harper's Ferry.\" Of Whitman he wrote, when few were reading him and\r\nfew of these approving:\r\n\r\n  I have just read his second edition (which he gave me), and it has\r\n  done me more good than any reading for a long time.... I have found\r\n  his poems exhilarating, encouraging.... We ought to rejoice greatly\r\n  in him. He occasionally suggests something a little more than human.\r\n  You can't confound him with the other inhabitants of Brooklyn or New\r\n  York. How they must shudder when they read him!... Since I have seen\r\n  him, I find I am not disturbed by any brag or egoism in his book. He\r\n  may turn out the least of a braggart of all, having a better right to\r\n  be confident.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown he had met in Concord only a few weeks before the Harper's\r\nFerry raid. Two weeks after the capture of Brown he delivered an\r\naddress on the issues, first in Concord and later in Worcester and in\r\nBoston, defying his friends who advised him to silence. And after the\r\nexecution of the old Kansan he arranged funeral services in Concord.\r\n\r\n  It turns what sweetness I have to gall, to hear, or hear of, the\r\n  remarks of some of my neighbors. When we heard at first that he was\r\n  dead, one of my townsmen observed that \"he died as the fool dieth\";\r\n  which, pardon me, for an instant suggested a likeness in him dying to\r\n  my neighbor living.... This event advertises me that there is such a\r\n  fact as death,--the possibility of a man's dying. It seems as if no\r\n  man had ever lived before; for in order to die you must first have\r\n  lived.... I hear a good many pretend that they are going to die; or\r\n  that they have died, for aught that I know. Nonsense! I'll defy them\r\n  to do it. They haven't got life enough in them. They'll deliquesce\r\n  like fungi; and keep a hundred eulogists mopping the spot where they\r\n  left off. Only a half a dozen or so have died since the world began.\r\n\r\nThe final fact of these later years is the breakdown of his own health.\r\nIn spite of the moderation and sanity of his out-of-door habits his\r\nstrength began to fail him before he had reached what should be the\r\nprime of life. From the ages of thirty-eight to forty he had to\r\nexercise the greatest care, avoiding any heavy exertion. A severe cold\r\ncaught in 1860 developed soon into consumption, which carried him off\r\nin the spring of 1862 at the age of forty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n  HENRY DAVID THOREAU.

He did not belong to Concord\r\nin any literal or figurative sense, he was not an intimate of those\r\nwho did, he lived there for only seven years at two different periods\r\nin his career, and, wherever he lived, he was in thought and conduct\r\nanything but a group man. Yet he was a resident there for the first\r\nthree years after his marriage (1842-1846), and he developed enough of\r\na liking for the town to return to it for the closing four years of his\r\nlife. What the town was by tradition and what it had become through\r\nEmerson's influence made it the most congenial spot in America for\r\nHawthorne.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he lived far longer in Salem--all but twelve out of\r\nhis first forty-six years--and he belonged to the town of his heritage\r\nboth far more and far less. Through instinctive feelings which were\r\nquite beyond his control he belonged to Salem from the bottom of his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n  This old town of Salem--my native place, though I have dwelt much\r\n  away from it, both in boyhood and maturer years--possesses, or did\r\n  possess, a hold on my affections, the force of which I have never\r\n  realized during my seasons of actual residence here.... And yet,\r\n  though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling\r\n  for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content\r\n  to call affection. The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep\r\n  and aged roots which my family has struck into the soil. It is now\r\n  nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original Briton, the\r\n  earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and\r\n  forest-bordered settlement, which has since become a city. And here\r\n  his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled their\r\n  earthy substance with the soil; until no small portion of it must\r\n  necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little\r\n  while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment which\r\n  I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few of my\r\n  countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is\r\n  perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know.\r\n\r\nYet, strong as this unreasoned feeling was, to his mind the traditions\r\nof Salem were repellent, and it offered him no attractions as a place\r\nto live in.\r\n\r\n  But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that\r\n  first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky\r\n  grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can\r\n  remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home feeling for\r\n  the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase\r\n  of the town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on\r\n  account of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned\r\n  progenitor ... than for myself, whose name is seldom heard and my\r\n  face hardly known. He was a soldier, legislator, judge; he was a\r\n  ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and\r\n  evil. He was likewise a better persecutor.... His son, too, inherited\r\n  the persecuting spirit.... I know not whether these ancestors of\r\n  mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of heaven for\r\n  their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the heavy\r\n  consequences of them, in another state of being. At all events, I,\r\n  the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon\r\n  myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them--as\r\n  I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the\r\n  race, for many a long year back, would argue to exist--may be now and\r\n  henceforth removed.\r\n\r\nOn this side Hawthorne's attitude toward Salem--but really toward New\r\nEngland and all America--was like that of a man who has inherited debts\r\nof honor which he feels bound to discharge, though he never would have\r\nincurred them himself.\r\n\r\nHawthorne was born in this town of his affection and his distrust\r\non the Fourth of July, 1804. When he was four years old his father,\r\na shipmaster, died during a foreign voyage. The sobering effect of\r\nthis loss was increased by the way in which Mrs. Hawthorne solemnized\r\nit, for she dedicated her life to mourning, not only withdrawing from\r\nthe outer world but even taking all her meals apart from her little\r\ndaughters and her son. An accident to the boy when he was nine years\r\nold robbed him of healthy companionship with playmates by keeping\r\nhim out of active sports for the next three years. So he developed,\r\na bookish child in a muffled household. At this time he was reading\r\nShakespeare, Milton, and the eighteenth-century poets; later he was\r\nto transfer allegiance to the romantic novelists. In his fifteenth\r\nyear the family lived together for several months at Raymond, Maine, a\r\n\"town\" of a half-dozen houses on the shore of Sebago Lake. \"There,\" he\r\ntold his publisher, James T. Fields, late in life, \"I lived ... like a\r\nbird of the air, so perfect was the freedom I enjoyed. But it was there\r\nI first got my cursed habits of solitude.\" The need of proper tutoring\r\nfor college preparation caused his reluctant return to Salem, and he\r\nwas glad to escape from it again when he went back in Maine to Bowdoin\r\nCollege at the age of seventeen. He was not at all eager for college,\r\nbut regarded it as an unavoidable step in his training. At the same\r\ntime he rejected the prospect of entering the church, the law, or the\r\npractice of medicine, and even as a freshman he wrote to his mother,\r\n\"What do you think of my becoming an author, and relying for support\r\nupon my pen?\" With such a point of view he did no better work than\r\ncould have been expected. He was more interested in the reading of his\r\nown choice than in the assigned studies. He was somewhat frivolous, and\r\neven incurred discipline for minor offenses concerning which he wrote\r\nto his mother with amused and amusing frankness. He finished a shade\r\nbelow the middle of his class, and left Bowdoin with no more college\r\ninterest than he had brought to it.\r\n\r\nHawthorne's life for the twelve years which followed graduation\r\nexplains why he later referred so bitterly to his \"cursed habits of\r\nsolitude.\" The household to which he returned from Bowdoin was almost\r\nutterly unsocial. His mother's way of life had been adopted by his two\r\nsisters as well. The four members of the family--one is tempted to\r\nrefer to them as \"inmates\"--saw very little of each other as the days\r\nwent on. The young author neither gave nor received open sympathy. His\r\nwriting, done in solitude, was not read to the rest. Conditions would\r\nhave been sufficiently abnormal if he had daily come back to this sort\r\nof negative family experience from busy activity in the outer world,\r\nbut of the outer world he knew nothing. Not twenty people in all Salem,\r\nhe said, were even aware of his existence. If he left the house during\r\nsunlight hours, it was to take long walks in the country. He swam in\r\nthe near-by sea before the town was stirring; he walked the streets in\r\nthe shadows of evening. His vital energy was drawn from reading and was\r\nvented on his own manuscripts.\r\n\r\nHis writing during these years was done with patient persistence and\r\nwithout any reward of applause from the public. His first novel,\r\n\"Fanshawe,\" was published in 1828 at his expense, was a failure,\r\nand was subsequently suppressed--as far as the discouraged author\r\ncould recover the copies issued. From 1829 to 1836 _The Token_, an\r\nannual put out by S. G. Goodrich of Boston, was his main channel of\r\npublication, taking in these years about twenty-five stories and\r\nsketches. Through Goodrich he had also found a market for his wares in\r\nthe _New England Magazine_, and toward the end of the period in the\r\n_American Monthly Magazine_ of New York, and, best of all, with the\r\n_Knickerbocker Magazine_, which was the periodical embodiment of the\r\nIrving tradition and point of view. But though he was not unsuccessful\r\nin getting his work into print, he enjoyed no reputation from it, for\r\nonly a few discriminating critics took any notice of it, and none of\r\nthese was fully aware of the author's output, since he wrote not under\r\none but under several pseudonyms. The lack of wholesome human contact\r\neither at home or abroad told inevitably on Hawthorne's nerves and\r\ntemper--he had become abnormally thin-skinned--and resulted in the\r\ntouch of querulousness which the student finds from time to time in his\r\naccounts of himself. And it also resulted in the deep self-distrust\r\nand discouragement which grew steadily on him. \"I have made a captive\r\nof myself,\" he wrote finally to his old college classmate, Longfellow,\r\n\"and put me into a dungeon, and now I cannot find the key to let myself\r\nout,--and if the door were open, I should be almost afraid to come out.\r\nYou tell me that you have met with troubles and changes. I know not\r\nwhat these may have been, but I can assure you that trouble is the next\r\nbest thing to enjoyment, and that there is no fate in this world so\r\nhorrible as to have no share in either its joys or sorrows.\"\r\n\r\nWith 1837 the friendship of two college associates, Horatio Bridge, a\r\nman of political influence and a large heart, and Franklin Pierce, soon\r\nto be the president of the country, began to assert itself. Through\r\nBridge the publication of \"Twice-Told Tales\" was effected in 1838.\r\nThrough the influence these men were able to exert, Hawthorne was\r\nappointed weigher and gauger in the Boston Customhouse. With this post\r\nHawthorne for the first time entered into active life, yet when he lost\r\nit as a result of a change of administration in 1841 he was somewhat\r\nrelieved at the hardship. His engagement to Sophia Peabody led him next\r\nto attempt a living solution through residence and partnership in the\r\nBrook Farm enterprise during 1841. Again he was oppressed by having\r\nthe world too much with him, and in 1842, on his marriage, he settled\r\nin the seclusion of Concord for his first residence of something over\r\nthree years. At the end of this time the needs of his growing family\r\nmade an assured income imperative, and once more through the political\r\ninfluence at his command he was given a federal office, this time as\r\nhead of the customhouse at Salem. He held this position, like the one\r\nat Boston, until a political reverse took it away from him in 1849.\r\n\r\nHawthorne was now nearly forty-six years of age. For the twelve years\r\nfollowing the publication of \"Twice-Told Tales\" he had accomplished\r\nalmost nothing in creative authorship. The human sympathy and\r\ncompanionship of his marriage, much as it meant to him, was offset as\r\nfar as authorship went by the distracting need for money. With the loss\r\nof the post at Salem the outlook was almost desperate. In the dark\r\nhour, however, it appeared that his wife had saved a little from his\r\nslender earnings, and in the following months he wrote what appeared,\r\nthrough the friendly insistence of James T. Fields, as his first widely\r\nrecognized work--\"The Scarlet Letter.\" The first edition of this was\r\nexhausted in two weeks. The stimulus of popular attention encouraged\r\nhim to a rapidity of production wholly out of proportion to anything\r\nin his earlier experience. In 1851 \"The House of the Seven Gables\"\r\nwas issued; in 1852 \"The Blithedale Romance\"; and in the meanwhile\r\nvarious lesser narratives were produced. At this stage his political\r\nfriendships once more proved of value, and through the influence of\r\nPierce, now president, he was enabled to go abroad in the consular\r\nservice, first to Liverpool and then to Rome. His foreign residence\r\ncontinued until 1860 and resulted, in authorship, in the last of his\r\ngreat romances, \"The Marble Faun,\" the book of English reminiscences,\r\n\"Our Old Home,\" and the \"Italian Notebooks.\" With his return to America\r\nhe went back to Concord, but though he was quite free and undistracted\r\nby financial worries, his major period as an author was over, and he\r\ndied in 1864, leaving behind him only the unimportant stories \"Doctor\r\nGrimshaw's Secret,\" \"Septimius Felton,\" and the uncompleted \"Dolliver\r\nRomance.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the most obvious ways Hawthorne's literary output was a fruit\r\nof his peculiar heritage and surroundings and his consequent manner of\r\nlife. A reading of his \"American Notebooks,\" the product of the late\r\n30's and the 40's, reveals how definite was the preparation for the\r\nharvest to come. It was the gift of Hawthorne's imagination to shroud\r\nwith a kind of unreality characters and backgrounds that were drawn\r\nfrom close observation. His interpretation made them his own, though\r\nthey were evidently derived from the life about him. This process\r\nis in utter contrast, for example, with the invention of Poe. There\r\nnever were such individuals as Arthur Gordon Pym or Monsieur Dupin\r\nor Fortunato or Roderick Usher. They are essentially human, but they\r\nbelong to no time or place. But Arthur Dimmesdale, Jaffrey Pyncheon,\r\nHollingsworth and Kenyon, Hester, Phoebe, Zenobia, and Miriam were\r\nportraits, made in the image of people who had walked the streets\r\nfamiliar to Hawthorne. Poe's settings are convincingly real. One can\r\nvisualize every detail of the City in the Sea or the ghoul-haunted\r\nwoodland of Weir, although one realizes that they never existed in\r\nfact; but Boston, Salem, Brook Farm, and Rome supply actual backgrounds\r\nfor Hawthorne. Had the Puritans builded as securely as the Romans,\r\n\"The Scarlet Letter,\" \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" and \"The\r\nBlithedale Romance\" could be illustrated--as \"The Marble Faun\" often\r\nhas been--from photographs of surviving structures. Again, these actual\r\nscenes and people were put into stories for which there were historical\r\nbases, and the symbols around which they were constructed--like\r\nthe letter of scarlet and the many-gabled house--had been seen and\r\ntouched by the author. The Maypole of Merry Mount once stood on the\r\nWollaston hilltop, the great stone face is not yet weathered beyond all\r\nrecognition, and the legends of the Province House are amply documented.\r\n\r\nIn the Notebooks, particularly for 1835-1845, there is abundant record\r\nof how Hawthorne's fancy was continually at play with the material\r\nwithin his reach. He made definite entries as to past events and\r\nvital associations of old buildings. He made detailed studies of odd\r\ncharacters seen in his occasional little journeys into the world.\r\nHe even saved proper names, phrases, similes, epigrams which some\r\nday might be of use: \"Miss Asphyxia Davis,\" \"A lament for life's\r\nwasted sunshine,\" \"A scold and a blockhead,--brimstone and wood,--a\r\ngood match,\" \"Men of cold passions have quick eyes.\" But far more\r\nsignificant than these explicit items are the many which are suggestive\r\nof whole sketches or stories later to be written. Among these the\r\nfollowing may easily be identified: \"To make one's own reflection in a\r\nmirror the subject of a story\"; \"A snake taken into a man's stomach and\r\nnourished there from fifteen years to thirty-five, tormenting him most\r\nhorribly. A type of envy or some other evil passion.\" \"A person to be\r\nin the possession of something as perfect as mortal man has a right to\r\ndemand; he tries to make it better, and ruins it entirely.\" \"Some very\r\nfamous jewel or other thing, much talked of all over the world. Some\r\nperson to meet with it, and get possession of it in some unexpected\r\nmanner, amid homely circumstances.\" \"The influence of a peculiar mind,\r\nin close communion with another, to drive the latter to insanity.\"\r\n\"Pandora's Box for a child's story.\" \"A person to be the death of his\r\nbeloved in trying to raise her to more than mortal perfection; yet this\r\nshould be a comfort to him for having aimed so highly and holily.\"\r\n\"To make a story out of a scarecrow, giving it odd attributes....\" \"A\r\nphantom of the old royal governors, or some such shadowy pageant, on\r\nthe night of the evacuation of Boston by the British.\" What Hawthorne\r\nattempted was essentially what Wordsworth did: to lift the material of\r\neveryday life out of the realm of the commonplace.\r\n\r\nIn another and more important way Hawthorne's writings show the effect\r\nof these long years of preparation, and that is in the self-reflection\r\nin the majority of them, and especially in the four major romances.\r\nIn the quarter century between his graduation from Bowdoin and the\r\npublication of \"The Marble Faun,\" the most striking and the most\r\ndangerous feature had been his long isolation and the resultant\r\neffects of it. He had not withdrawn from the world in contempt; he had\r\ninsensibly drifted out of it. He was by no means indifferent to it; on\r\nthe contrary, he was increasingly sensitive to it. He needed to fill\r\nhis purse and he needed encouragement to write. Yet when he went out\r\ninto the market place he was cruelly ignored by many and shouldered\r\nabout by the hustling crowds, who were so used to their own rude ways\r\nthat they were often quite innocent of the affronts they put upon him.\r\nIt is a consequence of this unhappy experience that in the famous\r\nromances and in many of the shorter sketches the narrative is woven\r\naround two types--a shrinking, hypersensitive character and a rude or\r\ninsidious but always malevolent man who stands for the incarnation of\r\nthe outer world. For Hester and for Arthur Dimmesdale, for Hepzibah\r\nand Clifford Pyncheon, for Priscilla and for Donatello, no complete\r\nisolation is possible. No deed which involves them, whether committed\r\nby themselves or by others, can be committed without regard to the\r\nfuture. Always there is a knocking at the gate, as the outer world\r\ninsists on obtruding itself into the holiest of holies. And this\r\ninvasion is the more cruel as it is the less deserved. Chillingworth's\r\nmalign and subtle revenge on Arthur Dimmesdale is an exercise of poetic\r\njustice. It is a horrible but not undeserved visitation. But Priscilla,\r\nDonatello, and the two pitiful Pyncheons are innocent victims. Hepzibah\r\nand Clifford are hounded out of life by a bland representative of the\r\nlaw and the church, a wolf in the sheep's clothing of respectability.\r\nPriscilla falls in love with a reformer, one of the type who Thoreau\r\ncomplained pursued and pawed him with their \"dirty institutions\" and\r\ntried to constrain him into their \"desperate, odd-fellow society\"; she\r\nwilts at his touch. Donatello, the embodiment of innocent happiness, is\r\nenmeshed in the web of society and destroyed by the fell spirit at its\r\ncenter. Hawthorne never could have presented this view in its repeated\r\ntableaux if he had not for years seen the concourse of life rush by\r\nhim, and for years made his successive efforts to reënter its currents.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation is summarized in Hawthorne's introduction of\r\nSeptimius Felton, hero of the last work of his pen. \"I am dissevered\r\nfrom it,\" he says in the opening scene. \"It is my doom to be only a\r\nspectator of life; to look on as one apart from it. Is it not well,\r\ntherefore, that, sharing none of its pleasures and happiness, I should\r\nbe free of its fatalities, its brevity? How cold I am now, while this\r\nwhirlpool is eddying all around me.\" Yet, a moment later he snatches\r\na gun and rushes out of the house to where he can see the British\r\nredcoats passing the Concord house. He refrains from shooting, only to\r\nbe seen by a flanking party, and against his will is forced to fire\r\na deadly bullet. \"I have seen and done such things,\" he says an hour\r\nlater, \"as change a man in a moment.... I have done a terrible thing\r\nfor once ... one that might well trace a dark line through all my\r\nfuture life.\" To this degree, then, Hawthorne's surroundings and his\r\nown unfolding experience had supplied him with themes and materials.\r\n\r\nMuch of the remainder of his work had its source in his Puritan\r\ninheritance. To this the already quoted passage on old Salem (p. 237)\r\nbears witness. To this heritage is due in large measure the essential\r\ngravity of his nature, which has been unfairly but suggestively\r\ndescribed as a compound of \"seven eighths conscience and the rest\r\nremorse\"; and to this is partly attributable his absorption with the\r\npresence and the problem of sin in the world. \"The Scarlet Letter\"\r\ndeals with its immediate effect on the transgressor; \"The House of\r\nthe Seven Gables,\" with its effect on succeeding generations; \"The\r\nBlithedale Romance,\" with its blighting effect on the reformer, who\r\nis selfish and heartless even in his fight against social wrong;\r\n\"The Marble Faun,\" with the basic reasons for the existence of evil.\r\nYet though the Puritan strain in him could determine the direction\r\nof his thoughts, it could not determine their goal, for Hawthorne\r\nrecoiled from the Puritan acceptance of sin as a devil's wile to be\r\natoned for only through the sufferings of a mediator or the tortures\r\nof the damned. He rejected the Calvinistic fear of eternal punishment\r\nfor the Miltonic conclusion that the mind is its own place, and of\r\nitself can make a heaven of hell; at which point he was at one with\r\nthe Transcendentalists in substituting \"for a dogmatic dread, an\r\nillimitable hope.\" His indictment of the Puritans themselves was more\r\ninsistent than his charges against their theology. He condemned them\r\nfor their cruel intolerance and for the arid bleakness of their lives.\r\nSo he was at once a product of his ancestry and a living protest\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nBut Hawthorne was more than a Puritan apostate; he was in accord with\r\nmost of the rising individualism of his day. He felt that as the result\r\nof multitudinous changes in government, church, and industry, the\r\nworld had for the moment \"gone distracted through a morbid activity\"\r\nand needed above all things a period of quiet in which to recover\r\nits balance of judgment. So he distrusted the schemes of \"young\r\nvisionaries,\" \"gray-headed theorists,\" \"uncertain, troubled, earnest\r\nwanderers through the midnight of the moral world.\" Yet he acknowledged\r\nthat as long as the world could not be put to sleep, restlessness was\r\nbetter than inertia. The radical Holgrave, in \"The House of the Seven\r\nGables,\" is his most sympathetic portrait of young America. A colloquy\r\nwith Phoebe Pyncheon represents him as spokesman for the future, and\r\nPhoebe as the voice of the placidly thoughtless present. Her remarks,\r\nthough brief, are quite as significant as his.\r\n\r\n\"'Just think a moment [he exclaims] and it will startle you to see what\r\nslaves we are to bygone times,--to Death, if we give the matter the\r\nright word!'\r\n\r\n\"'But I do not see it,' observed Phoebe.\r\n\r\n\"'For example then,' continued Holgrave, 'a dead man, if he happen to\r\nhave made a will, disposes of wealth no longer his own; or, if he die\r\nintestate, it is distributed in accordance with the notions of men much\r\nlonger dead than he. A dead man sits on all our judgment seats; and\r\nliving judges do but search out and repeat his decisions. We read in\r\ndead men's books! We laugh at dead men's jokes, and cry at dead men's\r\npathos!--We are sick of dead men's diseases, physical and moral, and\r\ndie of the same remedies with which dead doctors killed their patients!\r\nWe worship the living deity according to dead men's forms and creeds.\r\nWhatever we seek to do, of our own free motion, a dead man's icy hand\r\nobstructs us. Turn our eyes to what point we may, a dead man's white\r\nimmitigable face encounters them, and freezes our very heart! And we\r\nmust be dead ourselves before we can begin to have our proper influence\r\non our own world, which will then be no longer our world, but the world\r\nof another generation with which we shall have no shadow of a right\r\nto interfere. I ought to have said, too, that we live in dead men's\r\nhouses; as, for instance, this of the Seven Gables.'\r\n\r\n\"'And why not?' said Phoebe, 'so long as we can be comfortable in\r\nthem.'\"\r\n\r\nProperly interpreted, this conversation implies vigorous criticism\r\nof both the youthful speakers. Holgrave's sweeping protests are too\r\ndrastic, but Phoebe's placid acquiescence is deadening. As if\r\nHawthorne were afraid his sympathy with Holgrave would not appear,\r\nhe goes on to say that in the course of time the youth will have to\r\nconform his faith to the facts without losing his hopes for the future,\r\n\"discerning that man's best directed effort accomplishes a kind of\r\ndream, while God is the sole worker of realities.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this breadth of view, combined with his technical gifts as a\r\nteller of tales, that made Hawthorne a great artist; for no degree of\r\nskill or cleverness can give lasting significance to the work of a man\r\nwho has not in spirit been taken up to a high mountain and shown the\r\nuttermost kingdoms of the world. Granted a \"philosophy of life\" which\r\ninspires a man to high endeavor and enables him to see the relation\r\nbetween the things that are seen and are temporal and the things that\r\nare not seen and are eternal, the creative artist need not be always\r\npreaching a moral or adorning a tale. The implications that he finds in\r\nhis material and the abiding convictions he has about life and death\r\nneed no labeling. They appear as a man's character does, from his daily\r\ntalk and conduct. Let the romancer state this in his own words:\r\n\r\n  When romances really do teach anything, or produce any effective\r\n  operation, it is usually through a far more subtile process than\r\n  the ostensible one. The author has considered it hardly worth his\r\n  while, therefore, relentlessly to impale the story with its moral,\r\n  as with an iron rod,--or, rather, as by sticking a pin through a\r\n  butterfly,--thus at once depriving it of life, and causing it to\r\n  stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude. A high truth, indeed,\r\n  fairly, finely, and skilfully wrought out, brightening at every step,\r\n  and crowning the final development of a work of fiction, may add an\r\n  artistic glory, but is never any truer, and seldom any more evident,\r\n  at the last page than at the first.\r\n\r\nNow and again Hawthorne forgot this, and stopped to expound and\r\nexplain, which was unnecessary. And now and again he used his powers to\r\nvent his feelings by contemptuous portrayal of living people, holding\r\nthem up to scorn, which was unworthy. But even though he lacked the\r\nOlympian serenity of the supreme story-tellers, he wrote as a wise\r\nman, and he wrote surpassingly well. It remains, then, to speak of his\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" from which the above\r\npassage is quoted, Hawthorne discusses his methods as a romancer: how\r\nhe combines materials at hand, but makes them present the truth of\r\nthe human heart not as the realist but under circumstances of his own\r\nchoosing and with a \"slight, delicate and evanescent flavor\" of the\r\nmarvelous. And this shadowy unreality, he points out, comes from the\r\nconnection of \"a bygone time with the very present that is flitting\r\naway from us. It is a legend, prolonging itself, from an epoch now gray\r\nin the distance, down into our own broad daylight, and bringing along\r\nwith it some of its legendary mist.\" It is a cue to every one of the\r\nlonger tales and to most of the short ones. Always the outreaching hand\r\nof the past plucking at the garments of the present,--the traditions of\r\nan elder day or the consequences of a deed committed before the opening\r\nof the story.\r\n\r\nIn a misty, twilight atmosphere, starting where stories frequently\r\nend,--with a momentous act already performed,--Hawthorne's romances\r\nproceed almost by formula. Each is dominated by a physical symbol,\r\nitself a suggestion of some connection with the past, continually\r\nrecurrent, always half mysterious. Each is told in terms of a very\r\nsmall group of characters, of whom three usually emerge farthest\r\nfrom the shadows. The best of his longer works are not put into the\r\n\"well-made plot\" strait-jacket; and on this point Mrs. Hawthorne's\r\ntestimony is on record that the plots grew out of the people instead\r\nof being imposed upon them. Each is made up mostly of analytic\r\ninterpretation of moods, and each is garnished with many a meditative\r\ncommentary on the story-text. Finally, each and all of Hawthorne's\r\nwritings are characterized by a scrupulous nicety of style, a\r\nleisureliness of sentence, a precision of diction that become the\r\ncourtly manners of the old régime. He was as simple as formality will\r\nallow, as formal as simplicity will permit. If we are to liken him to\r\nother writers, it will not be to any contemporaries, not even to Mr.\r\nHowells. The comparison will take us back to Goldsmith or Jane Austen\r\nor to those passages in Thackeray which are most reminiscent of the\r\nelder day. Moreover, the book style of Hawthorne was something quite\r\napart from his letter writing, which had a masculine directness and\r\nvigor. He was a late member of Irving's generation. When he wrote\r\nhe \"took his pen in hand\" to address \"the gentle reader.\" All such\r\nliterary amenities are now the oldest of old fashions; but when they\r\nwere the vogue Hawthorne was a master of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n  NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.

All the\r\nrest were college men, graduates of either Bowdoin or Harvard between\r\n1821 and 1838, and all were familiar from youth with the world of\r\nbooks. Whittier was a farm boy, sprung from untutored farming stock,\r\nand in the way of formal schooling had only two terms at Haverhill\r\nAcademy, paid for with his own hard earnings. He was no less retiring\r\nin disposition than the Concord group, yet he was early drawn into\r\nthe antislavery conflict, and through all his middle years (from 1833\r\nto 1865) he was an untiring man of affairs. Emerson's interest in\r\npolitics ended with the symbolical value of the Concord town meeting;\r\nThoreau's was registered in his spectacular protest (see p. 224) at a\r\npernicious national policy; Hawthorne's was limited to the performance\r\nof duties in posts at the disposal of his political friends; but\r\nWhittier undertook the achievement of national ideals through the\r\nadoption of wise political measures. The same American to whom Emerson\r\nspoke as a thinker Whittier addressed as a voter. In consequence of\r\nthis his immediate social value became greater, though the verse\r\nwritten in behalf of reform was inferior.[16] In spite of his active\r\nrôle in public life, however, Whittier was very much less a man of the\r\nworld than Lowell, Holmes, or Longfellow. These latter were all men of\r\nfamily, with advantages of college training and foreign travel. They\r\nwere conscious members of the intellectual aristocracy, bred in polite\r\nusages and steeped in polite literature. When Whittier came to Boston\r\nfor his first brief editorial experience it was not to the Boston of\r\nthe charmed circle to which they and their like belonged. It was not\r\nuntil he had won independent fame that he became their honored friend.\r\nBy birth he represented an old and stalwart element in New England\r\nlife--the comparatively unlettered pioneers who made up the silent\r\nmajority of the population.\r\n\r\n  [16] See his own acknowledgment in the \"Proem\" to the poems of 1842.\r\n\r\nHe was in every sense an Essex County man. He was born in 1807 in the\r\ntownship of Haverhill, to which his ancestors had come in 1638, on the\r\nfarm they had owned since 1647, in the house they had built in 1688. He\r\nlived in the little three-mile strip between the Merrimac and the New\r\nHampshire line for all his eighty-five years, first at his birthplace,\r\nand for the last fifty-six years at Amesbury, a few miles nearer the\r\nAtlantic. He thus became in a way an embodiment of local tradition. He\r\nfelt the strong attachment to his small part of the world that develops\r\nin a group whose memories and interests are almost wholly local, and he\r\nfelt an allegiance to the soil that could respond to Emerson's \"Earth\r\nSong\":\r\n\r\n      They called me theirs,\r\n      Who so controlled me;\r\n      Yet every one\r\n      Wished to stay, and is gone,\r\n      How am I theirs,\r\n      If they cannot hold me,\r\n      But I hold them?\r\n\r\nAs a consequence he described the homely beauties that surrounded him,\r\nrecorded the traditions of the region, and quite unconsciously, as his\r\nrimes often prove, wrote in its dialect (see p. 263). His sense of the\r\nreality of his state's division into counties is best indicated in the\r\nstirring roster which he calls in \"Massachusetts to Virginia\" (ll.\r\n67-80).\r\n\r\nTwo other fundamental conditions prevailed in Essex County, though no\r\nmore strongly than throughout the entire state. It was a time and place\r\nof splendid opportunities. In the colonial centuries, hardly more than\r\ncompleted when Whittier was born, pioneer America had barely coped\r\nwith the elementary problems of settlement. There still remained almost\r\neverything that had to do with the alleviations of life--with the nicer\r\nrefinements, material, intellectual, and æsthetic. For any young man\r\nwho could combine the will to do with some degree of action, the chance\r\nfor achievement was exhilarating,--as the Essex boys Garrison and\r\nWhittier were to prove. The religious impulse of the day was closely\r\nrelated to these other stimulating conditions. It had the momentum of\r\nthe generations behind it and the stir of the nineteenth century in it.\r\nIt was old like the country and new like the period. It was dedicated\r\nto a high purpose, but its purpose was more than the personal salvation\r\nof the communicant; it was the salvation of Church and State, the\r\nbringing of God's kingdom \"on earth as it is in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nWhittier grew up, then, in simple and unlettered surroundings,\r\ncomparable to those of Carlyle, much more propitious than those of\r\nLincoln. Like many another boy of the time when \"child hygiene\"\r\nwas undreamed of, he probably suffered from insufficient clothing,\r\nunsuitable food, and undue exertion on the farm. At any rate his vigor\r\nwas impaired and he matured, as often has happened, with just the\r\nfragility of health that responded to enforced care and resulted in\r\nlong life. The reading supplied at home was arid,--a few narratives of\r\nfrontier adventure, a few religious books, \"the Bible towering o'er the\r\nrest,\" and a number of biographies.\r\n\r\n      The Lives of Franklin and of Penn,\r\n      Of Fox and Scott, all worthy men.\r\n      The Lives of Pope, of Young, and Prior,\r\n      Of Milton, Addison and Dyer;\r\n      Of Doddridge, Fénelon and Gray,\r\n      Armstrong, Akenside and Gay.\r\n      The Life of Burroughs, too, I've read,\r\n      As big a rogue as e'er was made;\r\n      And Tufts, who, I will be civil,\r\n      Was worse than an incarnate devil.\r\n\r\nPoetry came to Whittier through the chance visit of a Yankee gypsy,\r\n\"'a pawky auld carle' of a wandering Scotchman. To him I owe my first\r\nintroduction to the songs of Burns. After eating his bread and cheese\r\nand drinking his mug of cider he gave us Bonny Doon, Highland Mary,\r\nand Auld Lang Syne.\" When the boy was fourteen his first schoolmaster,\r\nJoshua Coffin, brought a volume of Burns one day to the house and\r\nwas persuaded to leave it for a while as a loan. With that closer\r\nintroduction to the world of poetry Whittier's own verse-writing began.\r\n\r\nAt eighteen he composed the first bit that was destined to appear in\r\nprint. It was an imitation of Moore, \"The Exile's Departure,\" which was\r\nsent without his knowledge to William Lloyd Garrison's _Free Press_\r\nat Newburyport and published in June, 1826. The young editor, himself\r\nonly twenty-one, was greatly impressed by the promise of these lines\r\nand hunted up the author, coming to the farm just when the embarrassed\r\nyouth was hunting out a stolen hen's nest under the barn. Garrison's\r\ninterest was of the greatest importance. Whittier was encouraged\r\nto write the nearly one hundred pieces of verse which appeared in\r\nthe _Haverhill Gazette_ in 1827 and 1828, and to earn by shoemaking\r\nthe money necessary for his first summer term in the new Haverhill\r\nAcademy in 1827. The little learning he thus secured he converted by\r\nschool-teaching into enough to take him for another term the next year,\r\nand then in 1828, through the continuing influence of Garrison, he was\r\ngiven his first position as an editor, on the _American Manufacturer_\r\nin Boston. He was still a simple country boy, and his published\r\naddress, \"to the young mechanics of New England,\" suggests that he had\r\nnot been encouraged to forget this fact during his first four months in\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n  He has felt, in common with you all, the injustice of that illiberal\r\n  feeling, which has been manifested toward mechanics by the wealthy\r\n  and arrogant of other classes. He has felt his cheeks burn, and his\r\n  pulse quicken, when witnessing the open, undisguised contempt with\r\n  which his friends have been received--not from any defect in their\r\n  moral character, their minds, or their persons, but simply because\r\n  they depended upon their own exertions for their means of existence,\r\n  and upon their own industry and talents for a passport to public\r\n  favor.\r\n\r\nHe held his post here only from January to August, 1829, when he was\r\nsummoned home by his father's illness. Editorship of the _Haverhill\r\nGazette_ followed for the first half of 1830, when he was called to\r\nthe _New England Review_ in Hartford, Connecticut. This position he\r\noccupied with one interruption until the end of 1831, at which time he\r\ntook his leave of journalism.\r\n\r\nHe was twenty-four years old--in the restless period between youth and\r\nreal manhood. He had known little but hardship and had come out of\r\nit with impaired health. There was little to cheer him in the tragic\r\ncareer of Burns, in the almost desperate enthusiasm of Garrison, or in\r\nthe cynicism of Byron, to which he had lately become subject. To cap\r\nall, he had been \"crossed in love.\" He could not even have the grim\r\ncomfort of realizing that he was passing through a youthful phase when\r\nhe wrote to a friend:\r\n\r\n  Disappointment in a thousand ways has gone over my heart, and left it\r\n  dust. Yet I still look forward with high anticipations. I have placed\r\n  the goal of my ambitions high--but with the blessing of God it shall\r\n  be reached. The world has at last breathed into my bosom a portion\r\n  of its own bitterness, and I now feel as if I would wrestle manfully\r\n  in the strife of men. If my life is spared, the world shall know me\r\n  in a loftier capacity than _as a writer of rhymes_. There--is not\r\n  that boasting?--But I have said it with a strong pulse and a swelling\r\n  heart, and I shall strive to realize it.\r\n\r\nThis temporary abandonment of poetry was after all only an evidence\r\nof his regard for it. With all the other young writers of his day, he\r\nwas hoping for new achievement in American literature and wondering in\r\nthe back of his mind if he were not to be a contributor to it. At the\r\nmoment Bryant had turned to journalism the New England group were not\r\nyet articulate, and the call of politics was loud. \"There was nowhere\r\nin America a writer of verse with more immediate promise than Whittier,\r\n[yet] he was a sick man in the old house at the back of Job's Hill,\r\ndisgusted with poetry and planning how he could best get to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Garrison's influence was to determine him. The general\r\ninclination toward humanitarian reform had stirred him to the\r\nestablishment of the _Liberator_, and when he declared, \"I am in\r\nearnest--I will not equivocate--I will not excuse--I will not retreat\r\na single inch--AND I WILL BE HEARD,\" he found a natural ally\r\nin Whittier. The great step came in 1833 with the poet's publication\r\nat his own expense of the pamphlet \"Justice and Expediency,\" with\r\nits wider circulation through reprints by sympathizers, with the\r\ncontroversial sequels, and with his share in the founding of the\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society. In the years to come he said, \"I set a\r\nhigher value on my name as appended to the Anti-Slavery Declaration\r\nof 1833, than on the title-page of any book.\" It was the deepest test\r\nof courage. In the first place it meant that a sensitive young poet\r\nwho had already felt the injustice of the conservative classes must\r\nlay himself open to their contempt and ridicule. It was a bitter time\r\nto do this, for never was a day when the miscellaneous inclination\r\nto reform offered so great an array of amusing causes and champions.\r\nEmerson's derisive list, \"Madmen, madwomen, men with beards, Dunkers,\r\nMuggletonians, Come-outers, Groaners, Agrarians, Seventh-Day-Baptists,\r\nQuakers, Abolitionists, Calvinists, Unitarians and Philosophers,\" is\r\nevidence of the degree to which the general idea of reform had been\r\ndiscredited even in the most liberal minds. For there is no doubt that\r\nmany of the projects were foolish or that the hopes reposed in them as\r\nsocial cure-alls were ridiculous. But the adoption of the abolition\r\ncause involved far more than ridicule--nothing less than the completest\r\ndisapproval of most good citizens. Considered in the large, lawyers\r\nand clergymen are conservatives by profession, deeply committed to\r\nthe past; and here was slavery sanctioned in the law and the gospel.\r\nThe prosperous merchant and banker are never markedly eager for a\r\nchange from the conditions which have fostered their prosperity; and\r\nhere was a whole economic system, from the plantations of the South\r\nto the financial houses of Wall Street and State Street, erected on\r\na foundation of slave labor. According to Emerson cotton thread held\r\nthe Union together. Men might devote their lives to the substitution\r\nof hooks and eyes for buttons or the adoption of a vegetarian diet,\r\nand get their pay in laughter, but when they threatened to disturb\r\nthe industrial system they were pelted and hated and cursed. All this\r\nWhittier foresaw when he followed his own counsel of later years,\r\n\"My lad, if thou wouldst win success, join thyself to some unpopular\r\nbut noble cause.\" The history of his participation in the abolition\r\nmovement does not belong to such a chapter as this except for a record\r\nof how he used his literary powers for the good of the cause, and for a\r\ncomment on the kind of poetry that inevitably resulted from such use.\r\n\r\nBetween 1831 and 1833 Whittier had become intelligently interested\r\nin politics; indeed, had he been a few months older in the autumn of\r\n1832 it is possible that he might have been elected to Congress as a\r\ncompromise candidate when Caleb Cushing was unable to secure the seat\r\nfor himself, though strong enough to prevent the choice of an opponent.\r\nThe young poet had thus learned a good deal about the value of public\r\nopinion and about the power of publicity in molding and wielding it.\r\nWhen the American Anti-Slavery Society was formed he had at his hand\r\na great megaphone that could project his voice to the far districts\r\nof the country. As a writer of propagandist verse he was endowed with\r\nwhat in an orator would be a \"natural speaking voice.\" His convictions\r\nwere deep and sincere, he had an easy command of simple rhythms, and\r\nhe was used to thinking and speaking in the language of the people. He\r\nwas in no danger of falling into academic subtlety or erudition. So,\r\nlike his greatest American predecessor in this field--Freneau (see pp.\r\n72-77)--he spoke again and again and always with telling effect.\r\n\r\nAs a good journalist and rhetorician he made his issues plain\r\nand simple--much simpler in fact than they really were, avoiding\r\nembarrassing qualifications. He appealed to the Northerners as a\r\npeople unanimously opposed to human bondage and not as a half-hearted\r\nand divided group. In a generation when the sense of statehood was\r\ninfinitely stronger than it is now he assumed a high level of altruism\r\nin Massachusetts, while he stimulated a sense of state resentment\r\nagainst Virginia or South Carolina. With the memories of the Revolution\r\nrefreshed by a series of recent semicentennials, he employed the\r\nconventional language of protest against tyranny; the antislavery\r\nverses resound with vituperative allusions to chains, fetters, yokes,\r\nrods, manacles, and gyves, with Scriptural idiom and with scorn for\r\nthe repudiation of Revolutionary principles of freedom. In the opening\r\nlines of \"The Crisis\" he was skillfully suggestive by his paraphrase\r\nof the missionary hymn \"From Greenland's Icy Mountains,\" and in the\r\n\"Letter from a Missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,\r\nin Kansas to a Distinguished Politician\" he turned to contempt the\r\nperversion of the Scriptures in defense of slavery.\r\n\r\n      \"Go it, old hoss!\" they cried, and cursed the niggers--\r\n      Fulfilling thus the word of prophecy,\r\n      \"Cursed be Canaan.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was justifiable, though it frequently was anything but high\r\nart. At times, however, the heat of passion led Whittier to write\r\nlines for which there was little or no excuse. His disappointment at\r\nWebster's famous \"Seventh of March\" compromise speech in 1850 led him\r\nto the extreme of reproach which was felt by most of the North--an\r\nextreme from which he shared the common reaction of later years and for\r\nwhich he made the manly atonement of \"The Lost Occasion,\" moved by\r\n\"the consciousness of a common inheritance of frailty and weakness.\"\r\nThe lowest level of his war verse is reached in the most familiar\r\n\"Barbara Frietchie.\" This has all the attributes that are usually to\r\nbe found in popular favorites. It is conventional in form, easily\r\nintelligible, a narrative of picturesque tableaux, and capped with an\r\napplied moral. The only charge that can be fairly brought against it\r\nis, however, a fundamental one--that it is essentially false to the\r\nfacts. The middle third of the poem that has to do explicitly with\r\nStonewall Jackson is partly libelous and partly ridiculous. Jackson\r\nwas an honest and devoted man, but he is represented as coming through\r\nthe town like a stock-melodrama villain, blushing with remorse at the\r\nchallenge of Barbara and capping the climax with a burst of cheap and\r\nunsoldierly rhetoric. No doubt it expressed at the moment what the\r\npassions of war could lead even a gentle Quaker to believe; no doubt\r\nalso it was good war journalism; but granting these concessions, it\r\nstands as a deplorable evidence of the depths to which noble talents\r\ncan be degraded in the times that try men's souls.\r\n\r\n\"The Waiting,\" a poem of 1862, is in the loftier vein of one who does\r\nnot reënforce himself through disparagement of his enemies. It is\r\na lament of unfulfilled endeavor in behalf of an ideal cause. As a\r\nreally great lyric should be, it is both personal and general in its\r\napplication. It expresses the despondency of the enfeebled and aging\r\npoet that he could not join \"the shining ones with plumes of snow\" in\r\nthe good fight; and in its reference to \"the harder task of standing\r\nstill\" it alludes not only to his resignation at the moment but also to\r\nthe patient policy which in former years had estranged the extremest\r\nabolitionists from him. It also must have been an immediate source of\r\nconsolation to thousands who have been confronted by urgent duties\r\nthey could not perform; while at the same time in a broader way it has\r\nexpressed the faith of \"Ulysses\" and \"Abt Vogler,\" of \"In Memoriam\"\r\nand \"Saul\" and \"Asolando,\" that \"good but wished with God is done.\"\r\n\r\nLike Freneau (see pp. 71-81), but to a more marked degree, Whittier\r\nwas most popular at first for his journalistic, controversial poems,\r\nthough his most permanent work has nothing to do with either noble or\r\nignoble strife. He followed the example of Burns, who inspired his\r\nfirst literary passion, in writing simple lyrics and narratives of his\r\nown countryside. These included many of the legends of Boston, like\r\n\"Cassandra Southwick,\" of Hartford; like \"Abraham Davenport,\" or of\r\nhis beloved district north of Boston; like \"The Wreck of Rivermouth,\"\r\n\"The Garrison of Cape Ann,\" and \"Skipper Ireson's Ride.\" As a rule he\r\nwas not inclined to tell stories without some clear moral implication,\r\nand all too often he expounded this implication, sermon-wise, at the\r\nend. Thus he tells with dignity and fine effect the story of the Indian\r\nspecters of Cape Ann, who were finally driven away by the prayers\r\nof the devout garrison after repeated volleys from their musketry\r\nhad failed. In eighty lines the tale is told; an added stanza calls\r\nattention to the fact that there is a moral in the ancient fiction;\r\nand two more in a sort of sub-postscript indulge in a final burst of\r\npoetical exegesis. \"Skipper Ireson,\" the best of Whittier's ballads, is\r\nno less moralistic, but is done with more art, for the ethical point is\r\ndeveloped within the account instead of being tacked on after it.\r\n\r\nIn poems such as \"Hampton Beach,\" \"The Lakeside,\" \"The Last Walk in\r\nAutumn,\" and \"At Eventide\" Whittier pictures the nature surroundings\r\nof his long lifetime; and in a generous succession, from \"Memories\" of\r\n1841 to \"In School-Days,\" of nearly thirty years later, he takes his\r\nreaders along the borderlands of autobiography. Preëminent among his\r\nrecollections of persons and places is \"Snow-Bound.\" The snowstorm,\r\nwhich Emerson celebrated as a thing in itself, Whittier adopted as the\r\nbackground for a winter idyl. The \"Flemish pictures of old days\" which\r\nhe drew of his Haverhill homestead were annotated in great detail by\r\nthe poet, but their virtue lies not so much in the fact that they are\r\ntrue to a given set of conditions, as that they are essentially true\r\nto the rural life of Whittier's New England--just as the pictures in\r\n\"The Cotter's Saturday Night\" are true to the Scotland of Burns, and\r\nthe pictures of \"The Deserted Village\" to the landlord-ridden Ireland\r\nof Goldsmith. And to the attentive reader the contrasts between the\r\npeasant life of Great Britain and the nearest thing to it that can be\r\nfound in America are abiding witnesses to the practical virtues of a\r\ndemocracy. In this simple idyl, written with \"intimate knowledge and\r\ndelight,\" Whittier combined truth and beauty as in no other of his\r\npoems.\r\n\r\nFor summarized criticism of Whittier's poetry there are few better\r\npassages than his own \"Proem\" to the collected poems of 1849 and\r\nthe comment in Lowell's \"Fable for Critics,\" of the preceding year.\r\nWhittier acknowledges the lack in his lines of \"mystic beauty, dreamy\r\ngrace\" or of psychological analysis converted into poetry; Lowell\r\nconfirms the judgment with\r\n\r\n      Let his mind once get head in its favorite direction\r\n      And the torrent of verse bursts the dams of reflection,\r\n      While, borne with the rush of his metre along,\r\n      The poet may chance to go right or go wrong,\r\n      Content with the whirl and delirium of song.\r\n\r\nWhittier lays his best gifts on the shrine of freedom with an avowal of\r\nhis love for mankind and his hearty and vehement hatred of all forms of\r\noppression, and Lowell properly qualifies the value of these gifts with\r\nthe statement that the Quaker's fervor has sometimes dulled him to the\r\ndistinction between \"simple excitement and pure inspiration.\" Whittier\r\ndeprecates the harshness and rigor of the rhythms which beat \"Labor's\r\nhurried time, or Duty's rugged march,\" but Lowell says that at his best\r\nthe reformer-poet has written unsurpassable lyrics. And both pronounce\r\nstrictures on his rimes which have been conventionally repeated by most\r\nof the later critics who have commented on them at all.\r\n\r\nMany of Whittier's apparently false rimes, however,--as the author of\r\nthe \"Biglow Papers\" should have recognized--are perfect if uttered\r\naccording to the prevailing pronunciation of his district. Lowell\r\npasses for a scrupulous dialect expert when he writes, \"This heth my\r\nfaithful shepherd ben,\" but Whittier is derided for allowing the same\r\nfinal verb to rime with \"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,\" whereas\r\nthe sole difference is that one recognized the pronunciation in his\r\nspelling and the other took it for granted. If Whittier had employed\r\nLowell's method, in transcribing \"Barbara Frietchie,\" for example, he\r\nwould have written,\r\n\r\n      Quick, as it fell, from the broken sta'af\r\n      Dame Barbara snatched the silken sca'af,\r\n\r\nand he would have concluded with\r\n\r\n      Peace and odda and beauty drawr\r\n      Reound thy symbol of light and lawr;\r\n\r\n      And evva the stahs above look deown\r\n      On thy stahs below in Frederick teown!\r\n\r\nFor the _ou_ sounds belong to Essex County, and all the others to\r\nBoston and even to hallowed Cambridge. False rimes Whittier wrote in\r\nabundance, but by no means all of the apparently bad ones should be\r\ncondemned at first glance.\r\n\r\nUntil the publication of \"Snow-Bound\" in 1866 Whittier's verse, though\r\nwidely circulated, had brought him in but little money return. For\r\ntwenty years, he later recalled, he had been given the cold shoulder\r\nby editors and publishers; but as the hottest prejudices began to wane\r\nthey could no longer afford to neglect his manuscripts, for these\r\nhad in them the leading characteristics of \"fireside favorites,\" the\r\nonly sort of poetry that is always certain of the sales to which no\r\npublisher is indifferent. In the first place, their form is simple;\r\ncommon words and short sentences are cast in conventional rhythms with\r\nfrequent rime. They are therefore easy to commit to memory. In content\r\nthey are easy to understand, not given to subtleties of analysis or\r\nto philosophical abstractions. More often than not they are either\r\nnarratives like the war ballads and the New England chronicles or\r\nstrung on a narrative thread like \"Snow-Bound.\" Almost always they\r\ncontain vivid pictures; mention of \"Skipper Ireson\" or \"Telling the\r\nBees\" or \"The Huskers\" or \"Maud Muller\" recalls tableaux first and then\r\nthe ideas connected with them. And finally they contain the applied\r\nmoral which the immature or the unliterary mind dearly loves, the\r\nvery feature which proves irksome to the bookish reader serving as an\r\nadded attraction to the unsophisticated one. It is not difficult to\r\nadduce popular favorites which do not include all of these traits,\r\nbut beyond doubt the great majority of poems that are beloved by the\r\nmultitude contain most if not all of them. When, in addition to these\r\nfeatures, poems are essentially and permanently true to life and to the\r\nbest there is in life their vogue is likely to be lasting as well as\r\nwidespread. People cherish them as they do the melodies to which some\r\nof them are fortunately set, or as they do certain bits from Beethoven,\r\nMendelssohn, Chopin, and Schubert, which belong to the repertory of\r\nevery pianola or talking machine. On the other hand, the intricate\r\nbeauties of Browning and Wagner or the austerities of Milton and Brahms\r\nwill always be \"caviar to the general.\"\r\n\r\nThe last third of Whittier's life brought him the rewards he had\r\nearned and the serenity he deserved. He lived quietly at Amesbury\r\nunder his own roof or with his cousins at near-by Danvers. He was on\r\nfriendly terms with the eminent literary men and women of his day.\r\nA long protraction of ill-health from boyhood on had developed him\r\ninto a fragile, gentle old man, a little shy and reticent and to all\r\nappearances quite without the fighting powers which he had displayed\r\nwhen there was need for them. If one chooses to recall Whittier from a\r\nsingle portrait, it should be from one taken in his middle rather than\r\nin his later life, for the earlier ones are far more rugged.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed they were marked by a succession of public\r\ntributes. At seventy the most famous of the annual \"_Atlantic Monthly_\r\nDinners\" was arranged in his honor. At eighty his home state officially\r\ncelebrated his birthday. The anniversaries that followed were\r\nrecognized in the public schools of many states; and so with \"honor,\r\nlove, obedience, troops of friends\" he came to the end in 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.

Yet there was no such oneness\r\nof mind among Longfellow, Lowell, and Holmes as among Emerson and his\r\nyounger associates. Between Longfellow and Lowell the real point of\r\ncontact was their scholarship, and particularly their enthusiasm for\r\nthe writings of Dante; between Lowell and Holmes there was neighborly\r\nregard but no real intimacy of feeling. The Cambridge men, to be sure,\r\nwere different from the men of Concord. The fathers of all three\r\nwere professional gentlemen of some distinction, all were college\r\nbred, ripened by residence abroad, and holders of professorships in\r\nHarvard College. All enjoyed and deserved social position as members\r\nof the \"Brahmin caste,\"[17] all were frequenters of the celebrated\r\nSaturday Club, and all contributed to the early and lasting fame of the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_. But as far as their deeper interests in life were\r\nconcerned they went their several ways. Lowell was a representative\r\nfirst of New England and the North and later of the country as a whole;\r\nHolmes belonged far more to Boston than to the college town across\r\nthe Charles; so that, of the three, Longfellow, the only one not born\r\nthere, was most closely associated with Cambridge, less clearly allied\r\nwith any other part of the world. In the literary vista, therefore, the\r\nlocal relationship should not loom too large. Longfellow should be\r\nconsidered as belonging to the same decades with Poe and Hawthorne; his\r\ngreatest productive period was at its height when Poe was living, and\r\nwas over before the death of Hawthorne, and his attitude toward life\r\nwas similar to theirs in its sentimental fervor and in its artistic\r\ndetachment. Lowell, in contrast, was a factor in the issues leading\r\ninto and out of the Civil War, and Holmes's richest years bridged the\r\n'60's.\r\n\r\n  [17] See the first chapter of Holmes's \"Elsie Venner\" for a\r\n       discussion of this New England aristocracy of birth and learning\r\n       rather than of wealth.\r\n\r\nLongfellow was born in Portland, Maine, in 1807, the second of eight\r\nchildren. The matters of conventional record are that on his mother's\r\nside he was descended from John and Priscilla Alden, and that his\r\nfather was a lawyer with a good practice and a modestly well-equipped\r\nlibrary. Able tutoring fitted the boy to matriculate as a sophomore in\r\nBowdoin, in the class with Hawthorne, who was three years older. For a\r\ncoming man of letters his record as a student was exceptionally good.\r\nInstead of being unsettled by vague dreams, he was stirred by a very\r\ndefinite ambition for \"future eminence in literature.\" His whole soul,\r\nhe wrote to his father at the age of seventeen, burned most ardently\r\nfor it, and every earthly thought centered in it. Then, just at the\r\ntime when he was resigning himself to the law, in order not to be,\r\nlike Goldsmith, \"equally irreclaimable from poetry and poverty,\" the\r\ntrustees of Bowdoin, emulating the example of Harvard, established a\r\nprofessorship of modern languages, offered it to Longfellow, and set\r\nas a condition that he should prepare himself by study abroad. In the\r\nthree years from 1826 to 1829 his mastering of the Romance languages\r\nwas perhaps less important than his breathing the cultural atmosphere\r\nof the Old World. Life in America up to the nineteenth century had\r\nbeen a busy and self-centered experience. The chief consciousness of\r\nEngland and Europe had been a consciousness of other governments and\r\nof unsympathetic and conflicting loyalties; and now was beginning to\r\narise an awareness not only of how other peoples were ruled but also of\r\nhow they lived and what they were thinking about. Longfellow had little\r\nto say of foreign unfriendliness which was still disturbing Irving\r\nand Cooper and Bryant (see pp. 111-114). In preparing to teach foreign\r\nlanguages and literatures he yielded to the spell of their richly\r\npicturesque traditions; and his first work, \"Outre-Mer\" (1833), was an\r\neffort to expound these to his countrymen. This, too, Irving and Cooper\r\nhad done, and from now on the refrain was to be taken up by most of the\r\nwidely read American writers.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] A short list of the chief titles will include Longfellow's\r\n       \"Hyperion\" (1839), Willis's \"Loiterings of Travel\" (1840),\r\n       Taylor's \"Views Afoot\" (1846), Curtis's \"Nile Notes of a\r\n       Howadji\" (1851), Mrs. Stowe's \"Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands\"\r\n       (1854), Emerson's \"English Traits\" (1856), Bryant's \"Letters\r\n       from Spain and Other Countries\" (1859), Norton's \"Notes of\r\n       Travel and Study in Italy\" (1859), Hawthorne's \"Our Old\r\n       Home\" (1863), Howells's \"Venetian Life\" (1866), Mark Twain's\r\n       \"Innocents Abroad\" (1869), and so on down to and beyond Holmes's\r\n       \"Our Hundred Days in Europe\" (1887).\r\n\r\nAs an impressionable young American he fell into the declining\r\nsentimentalism of the period and wrote characteristically to his\r\nmother: \"I look forward to the distant day of our meeting until my\r\nheart swells into my throat and tears into my eyes. I cannot help\r\nthinking that it is a pardonable weakness.\" He was so absorbed by all\r\nhe was seeing and learning that he wrote no verse, letting the days go\r\nby until he concluded with the overwhelming seriousness of twenty-two\r\nthat his poetic career was finished. As a matter of fact he was just\r\ncomplementing his native American feeling with a sense of the glamour\r\nof Old World civilization, and was on the way toward combining the two\r\nas poet and professor. Returning to his old college he taught there\r\nuntil in 1836 he was invited to succeed Professor George Ticknor at\r\nHarvard, again with the condition--implied if not imposed--that he go\r\nabroad for study. On his second sojourn he extended his knowledge to\r\nthe Germanic languages, mastering them as thoroughly as he had French,\r\nSpanish, and Italian. In the end he is said to have had a fluent\r\nspeaking control of eight tongues, with the power to \"get along in\"\r\nsix more, and to read yet another six. Until 1854 he was engaged in\r\nhis duties at Harvard, giving no little instruction, engaging all\r\nhis assistants, and personally supervising their teaching. It was an\r\nirksome routine against which he began to rebel many years before he\r\nshook himself free. \"It is too much to do for one's daily bread, when\r\none can live on so little,\" he wrote in 1839. \"I must learn to give up\r\nsuperfluous things and devote myself wholly to literature.\" And in the\r\nsame year he referred in another letter to \"poetic dreams shaded by\r\nFrench irregular verbs.\"\r\n\r\nIf the distractions of his professorship had actually prevented all\r\nwriting, he would doubtless not have held it eighteen years; but\r\nin spite of handicaps his output was fairly steady throughout, and\r\nhis most richly productive period--1847-1863--half overlapped his\r\nHarvard service. Aside from his fruitful activities in formulating\r\nbooks and methods for language study, and aside from his unimpressive\r\nprose volumes \"Outre-Mer,\" \"Hyperion,\" and \"Kavanagh,\" his poetry was\r\nabundant and in a way progressive. Most memorable among the early types\r\nwas a sizeable group to which he referred in his diary and letters as\r\n\"psalms.\" Of these, of course, \"A Psalm of Life\" is best known. Like\r\nall the others of its sort, it has the traits that are sure to endear\r\nit to the multitude. It is in a conventional ballad meter, alternating\r\nlines of four and three stresses with alternating rimes, it is easy to\r\nunderstand, it is constructed around one vivid picture, and it conveys\r\na wholesome moral lesson. It is a general counsel to industry and\r\nfortitude. Its message is formulated in a closing stanza of \"The Light\r\nof Stars,\"\r\n\r\n      And thou, too, whosoe'er thou art,\r\n        That readest this brief psalm,\r\n      As one by one thy hopes depart,\r\n        Be resolute and calm,\r\n\r\nand its \"act in the living present\" is echoed in the daily achievement\r\nof the village blacksmith.\r\n\r\nLongfellow's labors as a translator began early and continued\r\nthroughout his career, but it is interesting to see that in the\r\nearlier efforts a sober ethical note prevails, whereas many of the\r\nlater translations are marked by simple charm and some by sheer\r\nfrivolity. \"The Coplas de Don Jorge Manrique\" is a transparently\r\nveiled homily on the vanity of human wishes; others from the Spanish\r\nare on \"The Good Shepherd\" and \"The Image of God\" and from Dante on\r\n\"The Celestial Pilot\" and \"The Terrestrial Paradise\"; there is an\r\nAnglo-Saxon passage on \"The Grave\" and a fragment from a German ballad\r\nin which a ribald discussion of \"The Happiest Land\" is interrupted by\r\nthe landlord's daughter who points to heaven and says:\r\n\r\n            ... \"Ye may no more contend,--\r\n      There lies the happiest land!\"\r\n\r\nIn January, 1840, the poet wrote to his friend George Greene:\r\n\r\n  I have broken ground in a new field; namely, ballads; beginning with\r\n  the \"Wreck of the Schooner Hesperus\" on the reef of Norman's Woe....\r\n  I think I shall write more. The _national ballad_ is a virgin soil\r\n  here in New England; and there are great materials. Besides, I have a\r\n  great notion of working on the _people's_ feelings.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, consequently, there appeared his \"Ballads and Other Poems.\"\r\nLongfellow had first intended calling the volume \"The Skeleton\r\nin Armor,\" but the collection grew in number until this poem was\r\noverbalanced by the weight of the whole, and until--which is more\r\nsignificant--the native ballads were crowded by the introduction of\r\npoems from the German and Swedish and Danish. The change of plan,\r\nthough slight, was indicative of what was taking place in Longfellow's\r\ndevelopment. He inclined, in the fashion of his day, to foster American\r\nsubject matter, but he was full of the spirit and content of European\r\nliterature which was unknown to his countrymen. Some years were to pass\r\nbefore he could hold his gaze away from \"outre-mer.\" Another letter to\r\nGeorge Greene shows how he was vacillating at this time.\r\n\r\n  A national literature is the expression of national character and\r\n  thought; and as our character and modes of thought do not differ\r\n  essentially from those of England, our literature cannot. Vast\r\n  fields, lakes and prairies cannot make great poets. They are but\r\n  the scenery of the play, and have much less to do with the poetic\r\n  character than has been imagined.... I do not think a \"Poets'\r\n  Convention\" would help the matter. In fact the matter needs no\r\n  helping.\r\n\r\n\"Excelsior\" is a complete poetic fulfillment of this idea. There is\r\nnothing essentially American in the aspiration of youth. Longfellow\r\ntherefore \"staged\" the ballad in the Alps, partly because the Alps\r\ndoubtless first occurred to mind and partly because in America no\r\nmountain heights were topped by the symbolic monastery from which\r\nthe traveler could be found still aspiring in death. Again, lyrics\r\nlike \"The Day is Done,\" \"The Old Clock on the Stairs,\" and \"The Arrow\r\nand the Song\" belong to no time or place but are meditative moments\r\nin the life of any thoughtful man. And finally, \"The Bridge\" is a\r\nrepresentative combination of native and foreign material. The bridge\r\nwith wooden piers used to stand exactly as described over the Charles\r\nRiver between Boston and Cambridge. It was so near the ocean that the\r\ntides swept back and forth under it as they do not under any bridge in\r\nLondon or Paris or on the German Rhine. Yet in the second stanza the\r\nlikeness of the moonlight to \"a golden goblet falling and sinking into\r\nthe sea\" is evidently an allusion to a picture in Schiller's \"König\r\nvon Thule,\" a literary allusion but not a false one, for the moonlight\r\nmight well look the same on the tide-tossed Charles as on the streaming\r\nRhine. In his \"Seaweed\" Longfellow seems to have been half explaining\r\nand half defending such poetic processes:\r\n\r\n      So when storms of wild emotion\r\n        Strike the ocean\r\n      Of the poet's soul, erelong\r\n      From each cave and rocky fastness,\r\n        In its vastness,\r\n      Floats some fragment of a song.\r\n\r\nThe one point to accept with caution from all Longfellow's poems of\r\nself-analysis is the oft-recurring reference to heroic strife. Whatever\r\nheroism he felt or displayed \"in the world's broad field of battle\" was\r\nmore quietly enduring than spectacular. The real Longfellow learned \"to\r\nlabor and to wait\"; if wild emotion ever struck the ocean of his soul\r\nhe possessed himself for the tumult to subside. The finest of all his\r\nlyrics, \"Victor and Vanquished,\" cannot be confirmed from the visible\r\nevidences of his career. The \"Poems on Slavery,\" for example, attest\r\nonly to the passive courage of his convictions. In 1842 it was no small\r\nmatter to come out clearly in public opposition to human bondage (see\r\np. 257). Longfellow did not hesitate to risk his growing popularity by\r\nissuing this little volume. He was, and he continued to be, the devoted\r\nfriend of Charles Sumner. Yet his antislavery heroism began and ended\r\nwith these seven poems, and their value lay more in the bare fact that\r\nhe had written them than in any ethical or emotional appeal.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1847 to 1863 was, all things considered, quite the most\r\nfruitful for Longfellow; and this contained no five titles to rival\r\n\"Evangeline\" (1847), \"The Song of Hiawatha\" (1855), \"The Courtship\r\nof Miles Standish\" (1858), \"The New England Tragedy\" (first form,\r\n1860), and \"Tales of a Wayside Inn\" (1863). Thus, although he by no\r\nmeans abandoned Europe and the thoughts of Europe, he came at last\r\nand altogether naturally to the development of American tradition and\r\nthe American scene. The immediate success of \"Evangeline\" (for five\r\nthousand copies were sold within two months) is easy to understand.\r\nThe material was fresh and the story was lovely. Longfellow's\r\nreading-public, accustomed to certain charms and qualities in his work,\r\nfound these no less attractively displayed in the long story than in\r\nhis brief lyrics. The pastoral scene at the start, the dramatic episode\r\nof the separation, the long vista of American scenes presented in\r\nEvangeline's vain search, and the final rounding out of the story plot,\r\nall belong to a \"good seller\"; and as it happened there was in America\r\nin 1847 no widely popular novelist. The field belonged to the author of\r\n\"Evangeline\" even more completely then a half century earlier it had\r\nbelonged to the author of \"Marmion,\" on the other side of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the journal of 1849 appears the entry, \"And now I hope to try a\r\nloftier strain, the sublimer Song whose broken melodies have for so\r\nmany years breathed through my soul in the better hours of life.\" This\r\nwas a reference to \"The Golden Legend,\" which appeared in 1851, and\r\nwhich was in the end to become part of \"Christus,\" completed not until\r\n1872. In a sense this was the most ambitious and least effective of\r\nall his undertakings. It was too scholastic for the public; it was not\r\na fit avenue to the feelings of \"the _people_\" whom in 1840 he had\r\nresolved to stir. By 1854 Longfellow entered in the journal, \"I have at\r\nlength hit upon a plan for a poem on the American Indians, which seems\r\nto me the right one and the only.\" This was to do with the traditions\r\nof the red man what Malory had done with the Arthurian story and what\r\nTennyson was soon to be reweaving into the \"Idylls of the King.\"\r\nSchoolcraft's Indian researches put the material into his hands, and\r\nthe Finnish epic \"Kalevala\" supplied the suggestion for the appropriate\r\nmeasure. It appeared in 1855 and was demanded by the public in repeated\r\nprintings.\r\n\r\n\"Hiawatha\" has a double assurance of wide and lasting fame in the\r\nfact that it appeals to young and old in different ways. It appeals\r\nto children because it is made up of a succession of picturesque\r\nstories of action. Their lack of plots is no defect to the youthful\r\nreader--nothing could be more plotless then the various parts of\r\n\"Gulliver's Travels\"--and on the other hand few children detect\r\nor care for the scheme underlying them as a whole. They are as\r\nvivid and circumstantial as \"Gulliver\" or as \"Pilgrim's Progress.\"\r\nFurthermore they deal with human types which belong to all romantic\r\nlegend: Hiawatha, the hero; Minnehaha, the heroine; Chibiabos, the\r\nsweet singer, or artist; Kwasind, the strong man, or primitive\r\nforce; Pau-Puk-Keewis, the mischief-maker, or the comic spirit,--any\r\nchild will recognize them for example in Robin Hood, Maid Marian,\r\nAllan-a-Dale, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck. Again, these human types\r\nare extended over into the animal world and even to the forces of\r\nnature, the latter, by the way, supplying frequently the place of the\r\nindispensable villain or obstacle between the hero and the achievement\r\nof his purposes.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the average adult who has read it in early life assumes\r\nthat he has advanced beyond \"Hiawatha,\" that he can put it away with\r\nother childish things, not realizing how much more than meets the eye\r\nresides within its lines. Moreover, some grown-ups who do attempt\r\na second reading are dissatisfied because their minds have stopped\r\nbetween childhood and maturity, stunted by too heavy a diet on obvious\r\nfiction and the daily newspapers. For the later reading of \"Hiawatha\"\r\ndemands the kind of intellectual maturity that can cope with \"Paradise\r\nLost\" or \"Sartor Resartus\" or \"In Memoriam\" or the classics which are\r\nquite beyond the child. The genuinely mature reader appreciates that\r\nthe legends and the ballads of a people are never limited to external\r\nsignificance and that, whoever may happen to be the hero, it is the\r\npeople who are represented through him. So the epic note emerges for\r\nhim who can hear it. A peace is declared among the warring tribes;\r\nHiawatha is sent by Mudjekeewis back to live and toil among his people;\r\nhe is commended by Mondamin because he prays \"For advantage of the\r\nnations\"; he fights the pestilence to save the people; he divides\r\nhis trophies of battle with them; and he departs when the advent of\r\nthe white man marks the doom of the Indian. And so the ordering of\r\nthe parts is ethnic, tracing the Indian chronicle through the stages\r\nthat all peoples have traversed, from the nomad life of hunting and\r\nfishing to primitive agriculture and community life; thus come song and\r\nfestival, a common religion and a common fund of legend, and finally,\r\nin the tragic life of this people, come the decline of strength, in\r\nthe death of Kwasind, the passing of song with Chibiabos, and the\r\ndeparture of national heroism as Hiawatha is lost to view,\r\n\r\n      In the glory of the sunset,\r\n      In the purple mists of evening.\r\n\r\nIt is no mean achievement to write a children's classic, but the\r\nenduring fact about \"Hiawatha\" is that it is a genuine epic as well.\r\n\r\nNo other poem of Longfellow's is so well adjusted in form and content.\r\nThe fact of first importance is not that Longfellow derived the measure\r\nfrom a Finnish epic but that the primitive epic form is perfect because\r\nit is the natural, unstudied way of telling a primitive story. The\r\nforms of literature that go back nearest to the people in their origins\r\nare simple in rhythm and built up of parallel repetitions. This marks\r\na distinction between the epics about nations written in a later age,\r\nsuch as the Iliad and the Æneid and the works of Milton, and the epics\r\nof early and unknown authorship, such as the \"Nibelungenlied\" and\r\n\"Beowulf.\" It was Longfellow's gift to combine the old material with a\r\nfittingly primitive measure, joining as only poet and scholar could\r\n\r\n          ... legends and traditions\r\n      With the odors of the forest,\r\n      With the dew and damp of meadows,\r\n      With the curling smoke of wigwams,\r\n      With the rushing of great rivers,\r\n      With their frequent repetitions,\r\n      And their wild reverberations,\r\n      As of thunder in the mountains.\r\n\r\nWith \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" Longfellow returned to New\r\nEngland and told his first long story of his own district and of his\r\nown immediate people. Both \"Evangeline\" and \"Hiawatha\" were narratives\r\nthat ended with themselves. The glory of the Acadians and of the\r\nIndians was departed. But \"Miles Standish\" was like the \"New England\r\nTragedies\" in dealing with a people who were very much alive. For the\r\nearly Puritan, Longfellow felt a thorough and abiding respect which was\r\nnot untinged with humor. For his self-righteousness, his stridency,\r\nand his arid lack of feeling for beauty the poet showed an amused\r\ncontempt, but for the essential qualities of rectitude and abiding\r\npersistence he was quite ready to acknowledge his admiration. There\r\nis a pleasant personal application in this story which he who runs is\r\nlikely to overlook. Miles Standish was a worthy man, says Longfellow;\r\nhe was stalwart, vigorous, practical, and when put to the test he was\r\nmagnanimous, too. But he was sadly one-sided. It was not enough to be\r\nlike his own howitzer,\r\n\r\n      Steady, straightforward, and strong, with irresistible logic,\r\n      Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.\r\n\r\nHe was of the sort who banished the birds of Killingworth with costly\r\nconsequence. The worthier character was John Alden--\"my ancestor\"--who\r\nwas like the Preceptor of Killingworth in his feeling for beauty in\r\nnature and in poetry and in song. \"Miles Standish\" is his most amiable\r\npicture of the Puritans. In \"The New England Tragedies\" Governor\r\nEndicott's death is a poetic and divine retribution for his persecution\r\nof the Quakers, and Giles Corey's sacrifice to the witchcraft mania is\r\na horrid indictment of bigotry unbridled.\r\n\r\nFrom 1863 on Longfellow continued in the various paths which he had\r\nalready marked out, but his work in the main was in sustained narrative\r\nand in translation. His rendering of Dante is the preëminent piece\r\nof American translation, at once more poetic and more scholarly than\r\nBryant's \"Iliad\" or Bayard Taylor's \"Faust.\" It was a labor of love,\r\nextending over many years, the fruit of his teaching as well as of his\r\nstudy, and in its final form the product of nightly counsels with his\r\nlearned neighbors, Charles Eliot Norton and James Russell Lowell. Age,\r\nfame, and the affectionate respect of the choicest friends saw him\r\nbroaden and deepen in his philosophy of life. Little psalms and ballads\r\nno longer expressed him. Life had become a great outreaching drama at\r\nwhich he hinted in his cyclic \"Christus: a Mystery.\" His last lyrics\r\nopened vistas instead of supplying formulas, and quite appropriately\r\nhe left behind as an uncompleted fragment his dramatic poem on the\r\ngreatest of dreamers and workers, Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of debate as to Longfellow's immense\r\npopularity. The evidence of the number of editions in English and in\r\ntranslation, the number of works in criticism, the number of titles in\r\nthe British Museum catalogue, the number of poems included in scores of\r\n\"Household\" and \"Fireside\" collections, and the confidence with which\r\nbooksellers stock up in anticipation of continued sales,[19] tells the\r\nstory. But these facts in themselves do not establish Longfellow's\r\nclaim to immortality, for there is no necessary connection between\r\nsuch popularity and greatness. There was little evidence in him of\r\nthe genius which takes no thought for the things of the morrow. Until\r\nafter the height of his career he never wrote in disregard of the\r\npublic. \"The fact is,\" he sent word to his father, when he was but\r\nseventeen, \"I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature.\"\r\nAnd even earlier he had laid down his program when he wrote, \"I am\r\nmuch better pleased with those pieces which touch the feelings and\r\nimprove the heart, than with those which excite the imagination only.\"\r\nHe had the good sense and the honesty not to pretend to inspiration.\r\nOn the contrary he was continually projecting poems and continually\r\nsitting down, not to write what he had thought but to think what he\r\nshould write. He was an omnivorous but acquiescent reader, and what\r\nhis reading yielded him was literary stuff rather than vital ideas. He\r\naccepted and reflected the ways of his own time and did not modify them\r\nin any slightest degree. He was never iconoclastic, rarely even fresh.\r\nHe had something of Pope's gift for well-rounded utterances on life,\r\nsomething of Scott's ability to tell a good story well, and withal his\r\nown benevolent serenity.\r\n\r\n  [19] See pages 2-7 in T. W. Higginson's \"Longfellow,\" _American Men\r\n       of Letters Series_.\r\n\r\nThis was not a supreme endowment, but it was a very large one, and\r\nhe developed it to a lofty degree. There will always be a case for\r\nLongfellow in the hands of those who value the inspirer of the many\r\nabove the inspirer of the wise. There are ten who read Longfellow\r\nto every one who reads Whitman or Emerson. His wholesomeness, his\r\nlucidity, his comfortable sanity, his very lack of intense emotion,\r\nendear him to those who wish to be entertained with a story or soothed\r\nand reassured by a gentle lyric. Edmund Clarence Stedman wrote finely\r\nof him: \"His song was a household service, the ritual of our feastings\r\nand mournings; and often it rehearsed for us the tales of many lands,\r\nor, best of all, the legends of our own. I see him, a silver-haired\r\nminstrel, touching melodious keys, playing and singing in the twilight,\r\nwithin sound of the rote of the sea. There he lingers late; the curfew\r\nbell has tolled and the darkness closes round, till at last that tender\r\nvoice is silent, and he softly moves unto his rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.

His father, the Reverend Charles Lowell, a Harvard\r\ngraduate, was pastor of the West Church in Boston, three miles away.\r\nElmwood was an ample New England mansion with the literary atmosphere\r\nindoors that is generated by the presence of good books and good talk.\r\nThe boy was one of a few day scholars at an excellent boarding school\r\nin town, from which he entered college in the class of 1838. Like many\r\nanother man of later distinction in letters, he was more industrious\r\nthan regular as a student, wasting little time in fact, but often\r\nneglecting his assigned work and sometimes lapsing into mild disorder\r\nto the extent of falling under college discipline. Toward the end of\r\nsenior year he was actually \"rusticated\" for a combination of petty\r\noffenses. Under this form of punishment the boy, who was for a time\r\nsuspended from college, was assigned to a clergyman in some country\r\ntown and required to keep up in his studies until his reinstatement.\r\nIt happened that Lowell was sent to Concord, and that here (while in\r\ncharge of a clergyman with the ominous name of Barzillai Frost) he\r\nwas fretting over the class poem, in which he commented with youthful\r\ncynicism on Carlyle, Emerson, the abolitionists, and the champions of\r\ntotal abstinence and of woman's rights. It was an outburst on which he\r\nlooked back with quiet amusement in later years:\r\n\r\n      Behold the baby arrows of that wit\r\n        Wherewith I dared assail the woundless Truth!\r\n      Love hath refilled the quiver, and with it\r\n        The man shall win atonement for the youth.\r\n\r\nAnd the proof that the boyish gibes were hardly more than a result of\r\nthe impatience at his ungrateful weeks in Concord is contained in his\r\nrecord of the inspiration which he owed in student days to Emerson the\r\nlecturer (see p. 211).\r\n\r\nIn the first years out of college, from which he graduated in 1838, he\r\npassed through the oft-trod vale of troubled indecision as to what he\r\nshould do with his life. He rejected at once his father's profession\r\nof preaching and abandoned thoughts of the law after he had earned\r\nhis LL.B. degree in 1840. And then, following a brief and frustrated\r\nromance, he entered upon an acquaintance which culminated in his\r\nmarriage to Maria White and resulted in his becoming a soberer and a\r\nwiser man. She was already deeply interested in the social movements\r\ntoward which his mind was maturing. His devotion to her took permanent\r\nform in his first volumes of poems, \"A Year's Life\" (1841) and \"Poems\"\r\n(1843), and her influence on him is shown in his zeal for the very\r\nreforms which he had derided in his class poem three years earlier. He\r\nfounded a new magazine, _The Pioneer_, which lived for three months in\r\n1843; he contributed copiously to _The Boston Miscellany_, _Graham's\r\nMagazine_, and _Arcturus_; and, what was much more momentous, he threw\r\nin his lot with the abolitionists by becoming a regular contributor to\r\n_The Pennsylvania Freeman_. In the meanwhile, also, in addition to his\r\npurely poetic work and to his reform enthusiasm, he took his first step\r\ntoward scholastic achievement with his \"Conversations on Some of the\r\nOld Poets,\" which appeared in a volume of 1844. From now to the end of\r\nhis life Lowell continued to distribute his energies among the fields\r\nof poetry, civics, and scholarship.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, 1846, and 1847 he wrote abundantly, widening his relations\r\nwith the magazines of the day and apparently finding no trouble in\r\nmarketing his wares. One piece of verse is preëminent in this period\r\nfor both immediate and lasting appeal--\"The Present Crisis.\" It was\r\nLowell's way of protesting at the national policy in the war with\r\nMexico and, in its contrast with Thoreau's method (see p. 224),\r\nthrows light on the reformer's later strictures upon the recluse. It\r\nwas repeated on every hand during the next twenty years and was given\r\nspecial emphasis through its frequent use by such orators as Wendell\r\nPhillips and Charles Sumner. It was in 1848, however, that he came to\r\nthe fullness of his powers, contributing some forty articles to four\r\nBoston periodicals and publishing four books \"Poems (Second Series),\"\r\n\"A Fable for Critics,\" \"The Biglow Papers,\" and \"The Vision of Sir\r\nLaunfal.\" He was only ten years out of college, and at that was only\r\ntwenty-nine years old, but he showed secure taste, confident judgment,\r\nand a seasoned ease of humor which belong to middle life. In the first\r\nand last, the more literary volumes, there is perhaps more evidence\r\nof youth. It appears in the effusive grief on the loss of his little\r\ndaughter, and in \"Sir Launfal\" Lowell seems to be working too clearly\r\nafter the somewhat confused formula laid down in the introduction\r\nto _The Pioneer_. Americans were to attempt a natural rather than a\r\nnational literature. They were to remember that \"new occasions teach\r\nnew duties.\" \"To be the exponent of a young spirit which shall aim at\r\npower through gentleness ... and in which freedom shall be attempered\r\nto love by a reverence for all beauty wherever it may exist, is our\r\nhumble hope.\" So in order not to be too aggressively national, he\r\nderived a theme from the literature of chivalry and adorned it with a\r\ndemocratic, nineteenth-century moral.\r\n\r\n\"A Fable for Critics\" is less consciously ambitious and more mature.\r\nJust how remarkable a piece of discrimination it was can be seen from\r\na comparison of the writers criticized in it with those in Poe's\r\n\"Literati\" of two years earlier. Lowell's subjects are familiar to\r\nthe modern general reader; he omitted no man of permanent reputation\r\nand included almost no one who has been forgotten. Poe's selections,\r\non the other hand, are quaintly unfamiliar as a whole to all but the\r\nprofessed student of literary history. His judgments on them are mostly\r\nsound, but his judgment in choosing them for treatment is open to one\r\nof two criticisms: either that he could not recognize permanent values\r\nor that, for personal and editorial reasons, he preferred to ignore\r\nthem. In the \"Fable\" Lowell for the first time put to public use his\r\nready command of impromptu verse. His pen was a little erratic, but\r\nwhen it would work at all, it was likely to work with happy fluency.\r\nThe jaunty treatment of his contemporaries was quite literally a\r\nseries of running comments, trotting along in genial anapæstic gait,\r\nstumbling sometimes on a pun, scampering with light foot across\r\nextended metaphors, and taking the barriers of double and triple rime\r\nwithout a sign of exertion. In point of method the \"Fable\" was a single\r\nexercise in writing the journalistic verse of which Lowell proved\r\nhimself master in the two series of \"Biglow Papers\" (1846-1848 and\r\n1862-1866). It was exactly deserving of Holmes's friendly comment, \"I\r\nthink it is capital--crammed full and rammed down hard--powder (lots\r\nof it)--shot--slugs--very little wadding, and that is guncotton--all\r\ncrowded into a rusty-looking sort of a blunderbuss barrel, as it\r\nwere--capped with a percussion preface--and cocked with a title-page as\r\napropos as a wink to a joke.\" Different as it is from \"The Literati\"\r\nin scale, tone, individual subjects, and method of circulation, the\r\ntwo deserve mention together as antidotes both to Anglomania and to\r\nwholesale praise of everything American.\r\n\r\nWith \"The Biglow Papers\" Lowell returned to the attack which he had\r\nbegun in \"The Present Crisis.\" He wrote in 1860:\r\n\r\n  I believed our war with Mexico (though we had as just ground for it\r\n  as a strong nation ever has against a weak one) to be essentially\r\n  a war of false pretences, and that it would result in widening the\r\n  boundaries and so prolonging the life of slavery.... Against these\r\n  and many other things I thought all honest men should protest. I was\r\n  born and bred in the country, and the dialect was homely to me. I\r\n  tried my first \"Biglow Paper\" and found that it had a great run. So I\r\n  wrote the others from time to time in the year which followed, always\r\n  very rapidly, and sometimes (as with \"What Mr. Robinson Thinks\") at\r\n  one sitting.\r\n\r\nHe wrote the nine numbers of the series not only in the dialect of\r\nthe countryside but from the viewpoint of a forthright, hard-headed,\r\nPuritan-tinged Yankee; and he put them out as the compositions of Hosea\r\nBiglow under the encouragement of Parson Wilbur, without the use of\r\nhis own name. He was surprised by the cordial reception of the volume,\r\nfifteen hundred copies of which were sold in the first week. If he\r\nhad put on the cap and bells to play fool to the public, he said, it\r\nwas less to make the people laugh than to win a hearing for certain\r\nserious things which he had deeply at heart. \"The Biglow Papers\" were\r\nundoubtedly Lowell's great popular success. They carried the fight\r\ninto the enemies' camp in the abolition struggle, they were resumed\r\nwith new success with the outbreak of the Civil War, and they widened\r\nthe reading public for his more sober political prose and for his more\r\nelevated verse.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lowell was not satisfied to be only a fighter. In a letter of\r\nJanuary, 1850, he wrote to a friend:\r\n\r\n  My poems hitherto have been a true record of my life, and I mean that\r\n  they shall continue to be.... I begin to feel that I must enter on a\r\n  new year of my apprenticeship. My poems thus far have had a regular\r\n  and natural sequence. First, Love and the mere happiness of existence\r\n  beginning to be conscious of itself, then Freedom--both being the\r\n  sides which Beauty presented to me--and now I am going to try more\r\n  _wholly_ after Beauty herself.... I have preached sermons enow, and\r\n  now I am going to come down out of the pulpit and _go about among\r\n  my parish_.... I find that Reform cannot take up the whole of me,\r\n  and I am quite sure that eyes were given us to look about us with\r\n  sometimes, and not to be always looking forward.... I am tired of\r\n  controversy.\r\n\r\nOut of such a mood as this came the natural decision to make his\r\nfirst and long-deferred trip to Europe, a sojourn of fifteen months\r\nin 1851-1852 with his wife and children. His wide reading of foreign\r\nliteratures gave the keys to an understanding of the peoples among whom\r\nhe traveled, and especially to an understanding of Roman culture.\r\nHis comments from Rome furnish an interesting contrast with Emerson's\r\n(\"Written at Rome,\" 1833). The reaction of the Concord philosopher had\r\nbeen wholly personal. Lowell's was wholly national.\r\n\r\n  Surely the American (and I feel myself more intensely American\r\n  every day) is last of all at home among ruins--but he is at home\r\n  in Rome.... Our art, our literature, are, as theirs, in some sort\r\n  exotics; but our genius for politics, for law, and, above all, for\r\n  colonization, our instinct for aggrandizement and for trade, are all\r\n  Roman. I believe we are laying the basis of a more enduring power and\r\n  prosperity, and that we shall not pass away until we have stamped\r\n  ourselves upon the whole western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOn his return to America he plunged eagerly into writing, but the\r\nsprings of utterance were soon sealed by the death of his wife.\r\nFollowing on the losses of his mother and two of his children this\r\nwas the fourth and most crushing bereavement within a very few years.\r\nHis recovery of working powers was aided by the distraction that came\r\nfrom an invitation to deliver the distinguished Lowell Lecture Series\r\nin Boston in the winter of 1854-1855. These were to be twelve in\r\nnumber, on poetry in general and English poetry in particular. The task\r\nappealed to him as combining the beauty and truth to which he inclined\r\nto turn after his years of conflict. He threw himself whole-heartedly\r\ninto the preparation and delivery of the lectures and succeeded\r\nadmirably with his hearers; but the greater result was an indirect\r\none. While they were in progress Longfellow offered his resignation\r\nof the Smith Professorship \"of the French and Spanish Languages and\r\nLiteratures ... and of Belles Lettres in Harvard College,\" a post he\r\nhad filled since 1836. Seven candidates of no mean ability presented\r\nthemselves for the vacant position, but the appointment was offered to\r\nLowell, who had not applied for it, in preference to them all. He spent\r\nanother year abroad before undertaking the work in the autumn of 1856,\r\nand held the position actively until 1877 and as emeritus professor\r\nuntil his death in 1891. In this work he was a scholar and a critic\r\nrather than a teacher. He gave almost no elementary instruction in the\r\nlanguages, and his methods with his classes were casual to the neglect\r\nof the usual college traditions. What he did for his students was to\r\nshare with them his own broad experience of life and letters and to\r\nshow them how the study of foreign literatures was one with the study\r\nof history and philosophy.\r\n\r\nLowell's course of life, however, could never be restricted to any\r\nsingle channel. If he had found in 1850 that reform could not take\r\nup the whole of him, he now discovered that scholarship was not\r\nall-absorbing. As early as 1853 the question of establishing a new\r\nBoston magazine had been in the air. When its chief promoter, Francis\r\nH. Underwood,[20] had made certain of its start, Lowell was secured as\r\nfirst editor and carried it through the most critical period, until\r\nin 1861 it passed into the publishing hands of Ticknor and Fields\r\nand under the editorship of the junior member of that firm, James T.\r\nFields. In the editorial office, as at Cambridge, Lowell was relieved\r\nfrom the heaviest humdrum labor (especially of correspondence) and\r\nwas enabled to give his best energies to creative planning, yet it is\r\ninteresting to see how effective were some of the detail criticisms\r\naccepted by poets like Emerson and Whittier and how vigilant he was in\r\nhis reading of manuscripts and proof sheets. Throughout it all he kept\r\nup a spring-flow of boyish jollity, no different in spirit from that in\r\nhis letters of college days.\r\n\r\n  [20] See Bliss Perry's \"Park Street Papers,\" \"The Editor who Never\r\n       was Editor,\" pp. 205-277.\r\n\r\nAn unpremeditated bit in one of his letters shows how the mind of\r\nprofessor and literary editor reverted to the excitement of politics\r\non the eve of the war. It is in a fragment of burlesque on the type\r\nof love story submitted to the _Atlantic_: \"Meanwhile the elder of\r\nthe two, a stern-featured man of some forty winters, played with the\r\nhilt of his dagger, half drawing and then sheathing again the Damascus\r\nblade _thin as the eloquence of Everett and elastic as the conscience\r\nof Cass_.\" From 1858 to 1866 he printed some sixteen vigorous and\r\nsubstantial political articles, besides many shorter notes and reviews,\r\nand during the latter four years resumed the \"Biglow Papers,\" repeating\r\nand building upon his original success. The aggressive fighting spirit\r\nwhich he carried into the discussion of definite men and measures did\r\nnot blind him to the permanent values of the matters in dispute. The\r\nconsequence was that his political writings were limited to the Civil\r\nWar only in the facts he cited, and that they apply to any war in\r\nthe principles to which he appealed. There is no better illustration\r\nthan \"Mason and Slidell: a Yankee Idyll.\" In this the Concord Bridge\r\nand Bunker Hill Monument bring the spirit of the Revolution to the\r\ndiscussion of a Civil War issue, and between them they utter almost\r\nall the basic contentions of the World War which broke out fifty\r\nyears later. They anticipate the vital things that have recently been\r\nsaid for and against military preparedness, international jealousies,\r\nthe changes made necessary in international law by the progress of\r\ninvention, the appeals to national hatred and to a tribal or national\r\nGod, the viciousness of an indeterminate peace, and the essential\r\nvalues of democracy.\r\n\r\nFrom this ordeal by battle Lowell seems to have risen into a broader\r\nand nobler serenity. He balanced the prose essay on \"The Rebellion: its\r\nCause and Consequences\" with the Harvard \"Commemoration Ode\"; the next\r\nprose volumes, \"Among my Books\" (1870 and 1876) and \"My Study Windows\"\r\n(1871), with the odes on \"Agassiz\" (1874) and \"The Concord Centennial\"\r\n(1875) and the \"Three Memorial Poems\" of 1877. In all the poems he\r\nlooked to the past, the struggle being over, for some evidences of\r\nstrength and beauty in American life and for some assurances for its\r\nfuture; and in the literary essays he looked beyond nationalism to the\r\npermanent and universal values in literature. His political writings\r\nhad appeared mainly in the _North American Review_, which he had\r\nedited (1864-1872) in coöperation with Charles Eliot Norton; and at\r\nthis point younger admirers called him into public appearances as\r\npresiding officer, as committee chairman, as delegate to a Republican\r\nnational convention, and as presidential elector. It even took some\r\ninsistence to carry through his refusal to run for Congress. Finally,\r\nin 1877 he entered as foreign minister on eight years of the highest\r\nservice to his country, the first two and a half at Madrid and the\r\nremainder at London. Few men in America could have equaled him in his\r\nqualifications for the Spanish mission. He had taught the language\r\nand the literature and was especially well-versed in the drama, and\r\ntemperamentally there was much in him which responded to the national\r\ncharacter. He wrote to Mr. Putnam, \"I like the Spaniards very well as\r\nfar as I know them, and have an instinctive sympathy with their want\r\nof aptitude for business\"; and to Professor Child, \"There is something\r\noriental in my own nature which sympathizes with this 'let her slide'\r\ntemper of the hidalgos.\" Both of which statements should be taken as\r\npartly true to the letter and partly indicative of the adjustability\r\nwhich distinguishes the American from the Englishman.\r\n\r\nThe most compact tribute to his five and a half years at the court of\r\nSt. James was the remark of a Londoner that he found all the Britons\r\nstrangers and left them all cousins. Lowell was one of the two extreme\r\ntypes of American whom Victorian England chose to like and admire. One,\r\nof the Mark Twain and Joaquin Miller sort, was free and easy, smacking\r\nof the wild West, completely in contrast with the English gentleman;\r\nthe other, in the persons of men like Lowell and Charles Eliot\r\nNorton, was the nearest American approach to cultivated John Bull. In\r\ndiplomatic circles Lowell's tact always mollified his firmness, even\r\nleading to criticism from some of his countrymen because he never\r\ndefied nor blustered. And in his immensely important appearances as the\r\nrepresentative of the United States at all manner of social occasions,\r\nhe charmed his hosts by the grace and pertinence of his public speech.\r\n\r\n  His speech was the happiest, easiest, most graceful conceivable,\r\n  with just the right proportion of play to seriousness, the ideal\r\n  combination of ingredients for a post-prandial confection.... He was\r\n  pithy without baldness and full without prolixity. He never said too\r\n  much, nor said what he had to say with too much gravity. His manner,\r\n  in short, was perfection; but the real substance that his felicity of\r\n  presentation clothed counted for still more.... And in England his\r\n  unexampled popularity was very largely due to this gift.[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] W. C. Brownell, \"American Prose Masters,\" pp. 271, 272.\r\n\r\nIn the years remaining to him after his return from London in 1885 he\r\nliterally uttered much of the best that he wrote. He was no longer\r\nan eager producer, but he could be stimulated to speak by special\r\ninvitations. So he delivered addresses out of the fullness of his\r\nexperience at Birmingham University, at Westminster Abbey, at the\r\ncelebration of Forefathers' Day in Plymouth, at the 250th Anniversary\r\nof the founding of Harvard, before the reform leagues of Boston and\r\nNew York, and at a convention of the Modern Language Association of\r\nAmerica. These, with his last volume of verse, \"Heartsease and Rue\"\r\n(1888), became his valedictory. He died in 1891.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature of Lowell's career is that he was a poet in\r\naction. His first and last volumes were lyrics. In the forty-seven\r\nyears between their issues he was always the artist. He brought his\r\nemotional fervor and his sense of phrase to his essays, addresses, and\r\noccasional poems and to his pursuit of scholarship. His natural first\r\ninterests were in the printed page and in the wielding of the pen;\r\nmeasured by weeks and months his life was largely lived in retirement,\r\nbut the step from reading and writing to active citizenship was an\r\neasy one, and in the world of action he seemed to make few waste\r\nmotions. What he did not only counted in itself but it enriched\r\nhis mind as much as what he read. And back of all his activity were\r\ncertain qualities that contributed to his effectiveness. He was a\r\nrepresentative man, a fact acknowledged by his classmates who elected\r\nhim their poet. He had the journalistic gift of saying excellently what\r\nothers were on the verge of thinking. He did little thinking of his own\r\nthat was original but much that was independent, and as a sane radical\r\nhe was sure of the hearing he richly deserved. He was clever and\r\ncharming, with a glint of errant unexpectedness, which was ingratiating\r\neven when it was far-fetched or even wantonly malapropos. His quips are\r\nlike the gifts and favors of old-time children's parties--hidden all\r\nover the house and just as likely to defy search as to turn up under a\r\nnapkin or in the umbrella of a departing guest. And behind all, Lowell\r\nwas prevailingly American, with the combined trust in democracy and\r\nfear for it that belonged to his group in his generation.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 on, Irving, Cooper, Bryant, and their followers had protested\r\nmore and more frequently (see pp. 111-114) at the certain condescension\r\nin foreigners to which Lowell addressed himself in his essay of 1865.\r\nYet all these men, and cultured America as a whole, played up to this\r\ncondescension and encouraged it by evidently expecting it--stimulating\r\nit by the peevish feebleness of their protests. Lowell, though loyal,\r\nwas always apologetic, always hoping to gain confidence in his\r\ncountrymen. His intimate friend, Charles Eliot Norton, was deferent\r\ntoward all things British or European, and, while working valiantly\r\nto establish sound canons of taste, felt a distress for the crudities\r\nof American life that was only a refinement upon the snobbishness of\r\nthe Effinghams in Cooper's \"Homeward Bound\" and \"Home as Found.\" The\r\nfact is that the refined American of the mid-nineteenth century was\r\nafraid to contemplate the incarnation of America. He knew that Uncle\r\nSam was too mature for it; he feared that it was like Tom Sawyer; he\r\ndid what he could to mold it into the image of Little Lord Fauntleroy;\r\nand he apologized for Whitman. When Mark Twain visited William Dean\r\nHowells in Cambridge in 1871 they were both young sojourners from\r\nwhat was to Cambridge an undiscriminated West. Young Mr. Clemens did\r\nnot care at all, and young Mr. Howells did not care as far as he was\r\nconcerned, though he cared a great deal in behalf of his friend, who\r\nwas so incorrigibly Western. And in recording his anxiety he recorded a\r\nstriking fact of that generation: that American culture was afraid even\r\nof the rough-and-ready Americans whom Europe was applauding. \"I did not\r\ncare,\" said Mr. Howells of Mr. Clemens, \"to expose him to the critical\r\nedge of that Cambridge acquaintance which might not have appreciated\r\nhim at, say, his transatlantic value. In America his popularity was\r\nas instant as it was vast. But it must be acknowledged that for a\r\nmuch longer time here than in England polite learning hesitated his\r\npraise.... I went with him to see Longfellow, but I do not think\r\nLongfellow made much of him, and Lowell made less.\"[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] W. D. Howells, \"My Mark Twain,\" p. 46.\r\n\r\nIn habits of intellectual nicety, in manners, and in social inclination\r\nLowell was an aristocrat; yet in spite of these tendencies, and quite\r\nevidently in spite of them, he was in principle a stanch democrat,\r\nand when put to the test that sort of democrat is the most reliable.\r\nThe conflict is interestingly apparent throughout his writings. The\r\naddress on \"Democracy\" of 1888 need not be gravely cited as proof of\r\nLowell's belief in government by the people; it is only the final\r\niteration of what he had all his life been saying. Yet after his usual\r\nleisurely introduction he approached his subject with the smile of\r\nhalf apology which had become a habit to him: \"I shall address myself\r\nto a single point only in the long list of offences of which we are\r\nmore or less gravely accused, because that really includes all the\r\nrest.\" It crops out in the Thoreau essay, apropos of Emerson: \"If it\r\nwas ever questionable whether democracy could develop a gentleman, the\r\nproblem has been affirmatively solved at last\"; and in the Lincoln\r\nessay: \"Mr. Lincoln has also been reproached with Americanism by some\r\nnot unfriendly British critics; but, with all deference, we cannot say\r\nthat we like him any the worse for it.\" In the ode on Agassiz he heaved\r\na sigh of relief that the great naturalist was willing to put up with\r\nNew England conditions; and even in the Harvard \"Commemoration Ode\" he\r\nbroke out suddenly with:\r\n\r\n          Who now shall sneer?\r\n      Who dare again to say we trace\r\n      Our lines to a plebeian race?\r\n\r\nThe point is not in the least that Lowell did not believe in democracy;\r\nevery deprecating remark of this sort was prefatory to a fresh defense\r\nof it. The point is that, as with a quarrel, it takes two to make a\r\ncondescension and that Lowell did his part. It is difficult to imagine\r\nthe young foreigner of \"German-silver aristocracy\" condescending with\r\nsuccess to Lincoln or Emerson or to Mark Twain or Whitman.\r\n\r\nThe frequent expression of this self-defensive mood is an illustration\r\nof another leading trait in Lowell--his spontaneity. Since he felt as\r\nhe did there would have been no virtue in concealing the fact, and\r\nLowell seldom concealed anything. He wrote readily and fully, often\r\nbeyond the verge of prolixity. He gave his ideas free rein as they\r\nfiled or crowded or raced into his mind, not only welcoming those\r\nthat came but often seeming to invite those that were tentatively\r\napproaching. Only in a few of his lyrics did he compact his utterance.\r\nMost of the introductions to essays and longer poems proceed in\r\nthe manner of the \"musing organist\" of the first stanza in \"Sir\r\nLaunfal,\" \"beginning doubtfully and far away,\" and what follows is\r\nin most cases somewhat lavishly discursive. The consequences of this\r\nmanner of expression of a richly furnished mind are not altogether\r\nfortunate. Much of his writing could have been more quickly started\r\nand more compactly stated, and practically all of it could have\r\nbeen more firmly constructed. Emerson's essays lack firm structure\r\nbecause they were not written to a program, but were aggregations of\r\nparagraphs already set down in his journals. Lowell's essays, although\r\ndeliberately composed, were equally without design. His method was\r\nto fill himself with his subject of the moment and then to write\r\neagerly and rapidly, letting \"his fingers wander as they list.\" His\r\nproductions were consequently poured out rather than built up. They\r\nhave the character of most excellent conversation which circles about a\r\nsingle theme, allows frequent digression, admits occasional brilliant\r\nsallies, includes various \"good things,\" and finally stops without\r\nany definitive conclusion. In this respect, while Lowell was by no\r\nmeans artless in the sense of being unsophisticated, he was also by no\r\nmeans artful in the sense of calculating his effects upon the reader.\r\nThe only reader of whom he seems to have been distinctly conscious\r\nwas the bookish circle of his own associates. He would fling out\r\nrecondite allusions as though in challenge, and he wrote in a flowing,\r\npolysyllabic diction which was nicely exact but which rarely would\r\nconcede the simpler word.\r\n\r\nThis same surging spontaneity was both the strength and weakness of his\r\npoetry. He inclined too much to foster the theory of inspiration. \"'Tis\r\nonly while we are forming our opinions,\" he once wrote, \"that we are\r\nvery anxious to propagate them\"; and as he indited most of his poems\r\nwhile he was in this state of \"anxiety\" they became effusions rather\r\nthan compositions. His first drafts, in fact, were fulfillments of\r\nBryant's injunction in \"The Poet\":\r\n\r\n      While the warm current tingles through thy veins\r\n      Set forth the burning words in fluent strains.\r\n\r\nBut in his revisions he was unable to follow the instructions to the\r\nend:\r\n\r\n      Then summon back the original glow, and mend\r\n      The strain with rapture that with fire was penned.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence his poems when published were as invertebrate as when\r\nhe first wrote them, and of the revisions in detail many were shifted\r\nback to their original form. The degree to which he tempered the wind\r\nof self-criticism to his own poetical lambs is the more noteworthy on\r\naccount of the acumen with which he commented as editor on the work of\r\nhis fellow-poets.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his easy command of versification, his gift of\r\nphrasing, and his rich poetic imagination resulted in very many\r\npassages of beauty and feeling, particularly in the later odes like the\r\nCommemoration and Agassiz poems, into which he poured the fine fervor\r\nof his patriotism. In these his sincerity, his intellectual solidity,\r\nhis idealism, and his nature-feeling combined with \"the incontrollable\r\npoetic impulse which is the authentic mark of a new poem\" and which\r\nEmerson ascribed to him in a journal entry of 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.

Yet relatively\r\nfew have read her other novels, and to-day those who turn to them do\r\nso not so much for their own sakes as because they contribute a minor\r\nchapter in the history of the American novel. She entered literature\r\nby the pathway of reform. \"The heroic element was strong in me, having\r\ncome down by ordinary generation from a long line of Puritan ancestry,\r\nand ... it made me long to do something, I knew not what: to fight for\r\nmy country, or to make some declaration on my own account.\" Then, when\r\nthe story-telling gift was developed and the reform was accomplished,\r\nshe continued to hold her mirror up to nature--a kind of Claude\r\nLorraine glass with a strong tint of moralistic blue in it.\r\n\r\nShe was born in 1811 at Litchfield, Connecticut, one of the five\r\nchildren of the Reverend Lyman Beecher by his first marriage. Her\r\nfamous brother, Henry Ward Beecher, was two years younger. The death\r\nof her mother when she was but four years old resulted in her having a\r\nsuccession of homes during girlhood: first with an aunt, then for some\r\nyears under her father's roof after his remarriage in 1817, and next\r\nfrom 1824 to 1832 with her older sister, Catherine, who had established\r\na school in Hartford. In all these experiences she lived under kindly\r\nprotection and in somewhat literary surroundings, and in all of them\r\nshe breathed an atmosphere which was heavy with the exhalations of the\r\nold-school Calvinistic theology. In 1832, when Harriet was twenty-one\r\nyears old, her father, after a six-year pastorate of a Boston church,\r\nwent to Cincinnati as president of the Lane Theological Seminary, and\r\nthe two sisters joined him there.\r\n\r\nThis move into what was then the Far West was not, however, a\r\nbanishment into the wilds, for Cincinnati was in those days a sort of\r\noutpost of Eastern culture. The Ohio River, which flowed by its doors,\r\nserved as the great highway from the East to the Mississippi Valley.\r\nThe city attracted early travelers like Mrs. Trollope and Harriet\r\nMartineau as visitors, and stimulated them to ungracious comment, which\r\nwas offset by longer or shorter residence of a distinguished succession\r\nof Massachusetts men. There were literary clubs, good and prolific\r\npublishing houses, and, in the _Western Monthly_, the beginning of a\r\nsuccession of magazines. Catherine wrote back from an advance trip of\r\ninspection:\r\n\r\n  I have become somewhat acquainted with those ladies we shall have\r\n  most to do with, and find them intelligent, New England sort of\r\n  folks. Indeed, this is a New England city in all its habits, and\r\n  its inhabitants are more than half from New England.... I know of\r\n  no place in the world where there is so fair a prospect of finding\r\n  everything that makes social and domestic life pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe seminary, a new institution, and Mr. Beecher, its first president,\r\nwere located together at Walnut Hills, about two miles out of the city;\r\nand while the father was occupied in his pioneer work the two daughters\r\nstarted a school for girls, with the double promise of Catherine's\r\nHartford experience and the type of people among whom they were\r\nsettling. But Harriet was not to be a schoolmistress for long. In 1833\r\nshe was the winner of a fifty-dollar prize in a short-story competition\r\nconducted by the _Western Monthly_, and in 1836 she married the\r\nReverend Calvin E. Stowe, her father's colleague in Lane Seminary. How\r\nshe persisted to combine authorship and maternity in the next sixteen\r\nyears is a marvel; none the less so because since the days of Anne\r\nBradstreet an occasional woman has succeeded. In 1842 her husband wrote\r\nto her: \"My dear, you must be a literary woman. It is so written in\r\nthe book of fate. Get a good stock of health and brush up your mind.\"\r\nIn the next year her first volume, a book of selected stories, was\r\npublished by Harpers; but by 1848 she was the mother of six children,\r\nthe oldest only eleven, and no more books had appeared.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she was not to sink under the tide of home drudgery.\r\nShe had visited in the South, witnessing the more kindly aspects of\r\nslavery, and in her own town she had seen the pursuit of fugitives, the\r\nconscientious defiance of law by devoted abolitionists, the violence\r\nof proslavery mobs, and had feared for the life of her brother, who\r\nwas reported to have suffered death with his friend Lovejoy, when the\r\nlatter was shot in Alton by a band of Missourians. In these exciting\r\ntimes it came to her more and more insistently that her writing must\r\nbe turned to good account. Lane Seminary was a seat of antislavery\r\ndoctrine and was very likely saved from destruction by its fortunate\r\nremoteness from the town. But \"Uncle Tom\" was not to be written from\r\nhere. In 1850, impelled by ill-health, Professor Stowe accepted a call\r\nto Bowdoin College, in which he had been a student. With three children\r\nshe preceded him, and for the two months before the birth of her\r\nseventh child, in Brunswick, she carried the entire responsibility of\r\nchoosing, equipping, and settling in their new home. In the meanwhile\r\nthe family bank account was disturbingly low, and she was attempting to\r\nwrite. And in the meanwhile, too, Webster's \"Seventh of March Speech\"\r\non compromise with the slavery forces had stirred the North as nothing\r\nbefore and carried the country one step nearer to the Civil War. In\r\nthe winter that followed Mrs. Stowe came to her great resolve to write\r\nsomething that would arouse the whole nation; and at a communion\r\nservice in February of 1851 there appeared to her, as in a vision, the\r\nscene of the death of Uncle Tom.\r\n\r\nThe story began its appearance in the _National Era_, June 5, 1851,\r\nand was announced to run for three months, but as it was allowed to\r\ntake its own course it was not actually concluded until April of the\r\nnext year. Although it had already attracted the widest attention, the\r\nquestion of publication in book form was in some doubt until it was\r\nundertaken by an obscure Boston firm, and the outcome was so uncertain\r\nthat the Stowes did not dare to assume half the risk of publication\r\nfor a prospect of half the proceeds. Three thousand copies were sold\r\non the day of issue, and three hundred thousand in America within the\r\nfirst year. In England, also, after an initial hesitation, reprinting\r\nwas soon started, and by the close of the year eighteen different\r\nhouses had put on forty editions, and in the end a million and a half\r\ncopies were circulated in Great Britain and the colonies.[23] Mrs.\r\nStowe's \"fortune was made\" of course; but of quite as much moment to\r\nher was the fact that her influence was made in the great fight in\r\nwhich she was enlisted. In 1853 she sailed for what turned out to be a\r\nsort of triumphal tour in Great Britain, in the course of which large\r\nsums of money were given her for use in antislavery outlay. Leading\r\nmen and women, who had been formerly indifferent, became through her\r\nbook secondary sources of influence. Moreover, there was value even\r\nin the opposition she had aroused. Whittier wrote to Garrison: \"What\r\na glorious work Harriet Beecher Stowe has wrought. Thanks for the\r\nFugitive Slave Law! Better would it be for slavery if that law had\r\nnever been enacted; for it gave occasion for 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'\"\r\nAnd Garrison wrote in turn to Mrs. Stowe: \"I estimate the value of\r\nanti-slavery writing by the abuse it brings. Now all the defenders of\r\nslavery have let me alone and are abusing you.\" The volume of objection\r\nwas so great and so much of it was directed at the honesty of the work\r\nthat the author reluctantly compiled soon after a \"Key to Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin,\" in which she presented documentary evidence for every kind of\r\nfact used in the story; and of this she was able to write: \"Not one\r\nfact or statement in it has been disproved as yet. I have yet to learn\r\nof even an _attempt_ to disprove.\"\r\n\r\n  [23] In view of the lack of any copyright protection it is\r\n       interesting to record that three of the London publishers\r\n       offered Mrs. Stowe an interest in the sales of their editions.\r\n\r\nThe only fair basis for criticizing \"Uncle Tom\" is as a piece of\r\npropagandist literature. It was not even a \"problem novel.\" It was a\r\nstory with an avowed \"purpose\": \"to awaken sympathy and feeling for the\r\nAfrican race, as they exist among us; to show their wrongs and sorrows,\r\nunder a system so necessarily cruel and unjust as to defeat and do\r\naway the good effects of all that can be attempted for them, by their\r\nbest friends, under it.\" Mrs. Stowe felt no pride in it as a story,\r\nreferring with perfect composure to the criticisms on its artistry.\r\nBut as a popular document she composed it with the greatest of art. It\r\nwas based on a profound conviction and on unassailable facts. It was a\r\npassionate assault on slavery, but it was candid in its acknowledgments\r\nthat many a slaveholder was doing his best to alleviate the system. Far\r\nmore than half the book is devoted to kindly masters and well-treated\r\nbondsmen; the tragedy of Uncle Tom is emphasized by the frustrated\r\nor careless benevolence of the Shelbys and St. Clare. The appeals to\r\nantislavery prejudice, moreover, could not have been more effective.\r\nThe democratic movement which had swept Europe in 1848 was fresh in\r\nthe minds of all thinking people. The challenge to Biblical Christian\r\nprinciple was made in a day when the citation of Scriptural authority\r\nwas almost universally effective. The natural resentment at beholding\r\nvirtue thwarted by viciousness was stimulated at every turn in the\r\nstory. And the frank association of beauty of character with beauty\r\nof form served its purpose. \"Let it be considered, for instance,\"\r\nwrote Ruskin in \"Modern Painters,\" \"exactly how far in the commonest\r\nlithograph of some utterly popular subject--for instance, the teaching\r\nof Uncle Tom by Eva--the sentiment which is supposed to be excited\r\nby the exhibition of Christianity in youth, is complicated by Eva's\r\nhaving a dainty foot and a well-made slipper.\" This was a chance\r\nillustration for Ruskin, who was writing about pictorial art, but the\r\npoint of it is fully illustrated by the visible charms of Eliza, Eva,\r\nEmmeline, and Cassie, as well as of George Harris, George Shelby, and\r\nSt. Clare. Uncle Tom was almost the only good character who needed\r\nthe defense \"Handsome is that handsome does.\" It is not at all likely\r\nthat Mrs. Stowe calculated on these various appeals--democratic,\r\ntheological, sentimental. In fact we have her word for it that the book\r\n\"wrote itself.\" With a moderately developed talent for story-writing\r\nshe happened to have just the tone of mind and the level of culture\r\nwhich were attuned to the temper of her day, and she employed them to\r\nthe utmost effect. Moreover, she used them just as Whittier used his\r\npowers in some of his moralistic poetry, not relying on her narrative\r\nto carry its own burdens but expounding it as she went along and\r\nappending a chapter of \"Concluding Remarks\" with various odds and\r\nends of afterthought--matters which do not belong in a novel and\r\nwhich do not even belong together in any well-organized chapter, but\r\nmatters which in a persuasive document doubtless were of great value\r\nin bringing back to the application the minds of those readers who may\r\nhave been diverted by the sheer human interest of the tale.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Tom\" was a success which, of course, could not be duplicated.\r\nThe second antislavery novel, \"Dred, a Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp,\"\r\nsold enormously on the strength of its predecessor and on its own\r\nmerits, but it could only fan the embers which had previously been\r\ninflamed. The task had been done; and though it was well repeated,\r\nand though the application pointed this time to the degrading effects\r\nof slavery on the master class, \"Dred\" could never be anything but an\r\naftermath to \"Uncle Tom.\"\r\n\r\nWith a removal to Andover, Massachusetts, in 1852, Mrs. Stowe\r\naccompanied her husband to his last post in another theological school,\r\nsettling into a congenial New England village in comfort at last\r\nand among cultured and orthodox neighbors. And here she continued to\r\nwrite until her final move to Hartford, doing her best work in the\r\nfield of provincial stories of New England life and character. The\r\nfirst of these, \"The Minister's Wooing,\" was her contribution to the\r\nnewly established _Atlantic Monthly_. With her recent successes fresh\r\nin the public mind, she was an indispensable \"selling feature\" for\r\nthe ambitious magazine. With this novel she made her first attempt,\r\nsince the forgotten \"Mayflower\" volume, to write a story in which the\r\nmoral should take care of itself. There was a moral, to be sure, and\r\na striking one, for it pointed to a distrust of the older New England\r\nCalvinism and made clear the distinction between a religion that\r\nuplifts and a theology that turns to scorn the religion it assumes to\r\nfortify. In Simeon Brown she developed the obnoxious professor of the\r\ndeclining faith.\r\n\r\n  He was one of that class of people who, of a freezing day, will plant\r\n  themselves directly between you and the fire, and there stand and\r\n  argue to prove that selfishness is the root of all moral evil.... He\r\n  was one of those men who suppose themselves submissive to the divine\r\n  will, to the uttermost extent demanded by the extreme theology of\r\n  that day, simply because they have no nerves to feel, no imagination\r\n  to conceive what endless happiness or suffering is, and who deal\r\n  therefore with the great problem of the salvation or damnation of\r\n  myriads as a problem of theological algebra, to be worked out by\r\n  their inevitable _x_, _y_, _z_.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] See \"Theological Tea,\" chap. iv.\r\n\r\nIt answers to the refrain of \"The Deacon's Masterpiece,\" which appeared\r\nwhile she was writing the book: \"Logic is logic. That's all I say.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no accident, therefore, that she represents Simeon, this piece\r\nof corrugated inflexibility, as equally far from Dr. Hopkins, the\r\nlarge-hearted Puritan who was bigger than his creed, and from young\r\nJames Marvin, who wanted to be better than he was but had no creed at\r\nall. In the chapter \"Which Treats of Romance\" Mrs. Stowe perhaps did\r\nnot let the moral wholly take care of itself, since she came into court\r\nas a special pleader for beauty as an ally of religion and brought an\r\nindictment against the niggardliness of a life founded on a dogmatic\r\ndread of eternal fire. The moral of the book, if one must be given in a\r\nsentence, is that love realized is even finer than love renounced.\r\n\r\nLike \"Uncle Tom\" and \"Dred,\" \"The Minister's Wooing\" has its element of\r\ninstruction as well as of edification, for it is a studied and faithful\r\npicture of Rhode Island life just after the Revolution--a period about\r\nas remote from Mrs. Stowe as the slave-story epoch is from the modern\r\nreader. And because it is less of an allegory the characters are more\r\nlifelike, not having to carry each his Christian's pack of argument on\r\nhis shoulders. As Lowell stated,[25] they were set in contrast not by\r\nthe simple and obvious method in fiction of putting them in different\r\nsocial ranks--aristocrat and commoner, master and man, Roundhead and\r\nCavalier, pioneer, Indian and townsman. Between Mrs. Stowe's village\r\nfolk caste distinctions were of little moment; a careful realism was\r\ntaxed to show the vital and homely differences between one individual\r\nand another. Her success in this respect is what gives any distinction\r\nto \"The Pearl of Orr's Island\" (1862). The Pearl herself, who is a bit\r\nof labeled symbolism (chap. xxviii),--a Little Eva transported to the\r\nMaine coast and thence to heaven,--is almost the only insignificant\r\ncharacter. Moses Pennell, an exotic, is comparatively lifelike, and the\r\nactual village people are as real as can be.\r\n\r\n  [25] _New York Tribune_, June 13, 1859.\r\n\r\n\"Oldtown Folks\" (1869) is Mrs. Stowe's most effective and least\r\nadulterated novel. The people of the story are many and varied, ranging\r\nfrom Sam Lawson, the village Rip Van Winkle, to the choicest of Old\r\nBoston adornments of society. While the book had no social purpose it\r\nhad the avowed narrative \"object ... to interpret to the world the New\r\nEngland life and character in that particular time in its history\r\nwhich may be called the seminal period\"--a statement followed by the\r\ncomplacent and thoroughly provincial assertion that \"New England was\r\nthe seed-bed of this great American Republic, and of _all_ that is\r\nlikely to come of it.\" It should be remembered in Mrs. Stowe's defense\r\nthat when she wrote these words the cleavage between North and South\r\ncould account for many asperities from both sides and that to most\r\nEasterners \"Trans-Mississippi\" meant territory rather than people. In\r\n\"breadth of canvas,\" to resort to the slang of criticism, \"Oldtown\r\nFolks\" is in Mrs. Stowe's whole output what \"Middlemarch\" is in George\r\nEliot's. It is filled with popular tableaux--in the old Meeting House,\r\nin the Grandmother's Kitchen, at the Manor House, in the coach on its\r\ngrave progress to Boston, in the school and its surroundings; and it is\r\nred-lettered with festivals in which the richest flavor of social life\r\nin the early nineteenth century is developed.\r\n\r\nAs a life story of the four youthful characters it does not linger\r\nvividly in mind. One does not recall them and their subjective\r\nexperiences half so clearly as one does their intellectual and social\r\nand material surroundings. Yet the shape of their life experience was\r\ndetermined by just these external influences; and how clearly they\r\nbelonged to a bygone period appears at a glance of comparison with any\r\nsimilar twentieth-century story.[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] This distinction is valid even though the Oldtown folks belonged\r\n       to Mrs. Stowe's childhood. The Andover of her later years was\r\n       Oldtown in all essential respects.\r\n\r\nMargaret Deland's \"The Iron Woman,\" for example, is a companion\r\npicture of four young people, but with how great a difference! The\r\nnew industrialism, the decline of a theology which is only a relic\r\nin the iron woman, Mrs. Maitland, the post-Victorian attitude toward\r\nsex and the family, suggest the vast change in the fashions of human\r\nthought in a half century; and this is no less convincing because the\r\nconclusions of Mrs. Deland's characters are practically identical\r\nwith those of Mrs. Stowe's. With Mrs. Stowe marriage is a finality and\r\nsexual sin a damnation in the sight of God. With Mrs. Deland marriage\r\nis an expedient and a protection for the woman who may otherwise be\r\nabandoned, and sin is punished in remorse and loss of reputation. Mrs.\r\nStowe is moved by the thought of hell; Mrs. Deland, by the possibility\r\nof Promethean tortures from within. And in the later book capital and\r\nlabor loom up to afford the background supplied in the earlier story by\r\nthe church and its communicants.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter century remaining to her after the writing of \"Oldtown\r\nFolks,\" Mrs. Stowe's life was a quiet fulfillment of her earlier\r\ncareer. From a Florida plantation on which she spent her winters\r\nshe worked for the welfare of the negro and the upbuilding of the\r\nSouth. She labored as before in coöperation with the church, but\r\nher repugnance for the grimness of Calvinism had led her to become\r\nan Episcopalian. As a novelist she kept on in the exposition of New\r\nEngland and Northern life to the mild gratification of the reading\r\npublic which she had already won--a reading public who enjoyed what\r\nLowell almost too cleverly called \"water gruel of fiction, thinned\r\nwith sentiment and thickened with morality.\" Her enduring fame will\r\ndoubtless rest on the fact that she was a story-writer of moderate\r\ntalent who in one memorable instance devoted her gift to the making of\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n\r\n  HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.

His whole lifetime was\r\npassed in two neighborhoods--that of Harvard College in old Cambridge\r\nand that of Beacon Hill in oldest Boston. He was born in the college\r\ntown in 1809, the same year with Lincoln. His father, the Reverend\r\nAbiel Holmes, was a fine exponent of the old orthodoxy and of the\r\nold breeding and a historian of the American Revolution. He was an\r\ninheritor of the blood of the Bradstreet, Phillips, Hancock, Quincy,\r\nand Wendell families, a kind of youth whose \"aspect is commonly\r\nslender,--his face is smooth, and apt to be pallid,--his features are\r\nregular and of a certain delicacy,--his eye is bright and quick,--his\r\nlips play over the thought he utters as a pianist's fingers dance over\r\ntheir music.\"[27] It was a type for whose aptitudes Holmes felt the\r\ngreatest respect. He thanked God for the republicanism of nature which\r\nevery now and then developed a \"large, uncombed youth\" who strode\r\nawkwardly into intellectual leadership. He acknowledged a Lincoln when\r\nhe came to maturity, but he expected more of a Chauncey or an Ellery or\r\nan Edwards because of his inheritance.\r\n\r\n  [27] \"Elsie Venner,\" chap. i, \"The Brahmin Caste of New England.\"\r\n\r\nA prevailing alertness of mind in Holmes's generation offset the\r\nnatural conservatism which belongs to an aristocracy. For a hundred\r\nyears Harvard had been more liberal than Yale. The cleavage was already\r\ntaking place between Unitarian and Trinitarian or Congregational\r\nbelievers. To be sure, the eyes of Abiel Holmes were focused on the\r\npast, and he sent his son to be schooled under the safe influences\r\nof Phillips Andover Academy, which were fostered by the orthodox\r\ntheological seminary just across the road. But even here Wendell--as\r\nhe was called--decided against entering the ministry because a certain\r\nclergyman \"looked and talked so like an undertaker.\" And when he\r\nentered college in his home town, while he faced the traditional\r\nrequired course of classical languages, history, mathematics, and moral\r\nphilosophy, the wind from over the sea was blowing through it, and he\r\nbreathed the atmosphere which was passing into the blood of Emerson and\r\nThoreau and George Ripley and the other Transcendentalists-to-be.\r\n\r\nIn his college days he was a little cheerful student of average\r\nperformance who refused then as always to take himself soberly,\r\nalthough he did not lack inner seriousness. He practised his gift for\r\nwriting and was rewarded by the acceptance of some of his efforts\r\nin the fashionable Annuals of the day--repositories of politely\r\nsentimental tales, sketches, and poems in fancy bindings which\r\nornamented the marble-topped tables in the \"best rooms.\" Under his\r\napparently aimless amiability, however, there was an independence of\r\njudgment which twice recorded itself, in 1829 and '30. The first time\r\nwas on the occasion of an issue in his father's church when the son\r\nwas forced to agree with the liberal majority, who literally took the\r\npastor's pulpit from him, so that he had to reëstablish himself in\r\nNorth Cambridge. Few harder tests could be devised than one between\r\nloyalty to conviction and loyalty to family interests. The other sign\r\nof independence was his choice of a profession. A boy of his heritage\r\nwas socially if not divinely predestined for some sort of intellectual\r\nlife. If he went to college, assurance was made doubly sure that he\r\nwould not become a business man. From the outset he rejected the\r\nministry as his \"calling.\" He shrank from the formal complexities of\r\nthe law as he did from the logic of the theologians. The thought of\r\nteaching did not seem to enter his mind. Literature could not afford\r\nhim a livelihood. By elimination, then, only medicine was left to him,\r\nbut in his day medicine did not occupy a position of dignity equal with\r\nthe other professions. Medical science was still in earliest youth,\r\nand the practice of \"physic\" was jointly discredited by the barber,\r\nthe veterinary, the midwife, the \"yarb doctor,\" and the miscellaneous\r\nquack. This young \"Brahmin,\" however, saw the chance for contributing\r\nto the progress of a budding science, and made his decision with quiet\r\ndisregard of social prejudice.\r\n\r\nStudy in Paris, successful research work, practice in Boston, and\r\na year's teaching at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire led to an\r\nappointment on the medical faculty at Harvard which he held actively\r\nfrom 1847 to 1882 and as emeritus until his death. As a practitioner\r\nhe was not remarkably successful. At the first his extremely youthful\r\nappearance and his jocosity of manner stood in the way. People could\r\nnot be expected to flock to the office of a young man who was known to\r\nhave said that \"all small fevers would be gratefully received.\" And\r\nlater his interest in things literary was regarded with distrust by\r\nprospective patients. As a teacher, on the other hand, he was unusually\r\neffective because of the traits which made him a poor business-getter.\r\nHe was vivacious and deft in his methods. He knew how to put his ideas\r\nin order, he was a master hand at expounding them, and he was ingenious\r\nin providing neat formulas for memorizing the myriad details of\r\nphysiology and anatomy.\r\n\r\nHis profession supplied Holmes with a background of thought which was\r\ndifferent from any of his contemporaries. It supplied him with titles\r\nand whole poems, such as \"Nux Postcoenatica,\" \"The Stethoscope\r\nSong,\" and \"The Mysterious Illness,\" with literary essays, such\r\nas \"The Physiology of Versification,\" and with a whole volume of\r\nmedical essays. It furnished the motives for his three \"medicated\r\nnovels,\"--prenatal influence in \"Elsie Venner,\" physical magnetism\r\n(by its opposite) in \"A Mortal Antipathy,\" and telepathy in \"The\r\nGuardian Angel.\" It was the basis for scores of passages and hundreds\r\nof allusions in the four volumes of the \"Breakfast Table\" series. And,\r\nfurthermore, in the natural sympathy which it generated in him for\r\nevery branch of progressive science it gave ground for the felicitous\r\ntoast:[28] \"The union of Science and Literature--a happy marriage,\r\nthe fruits of which are nowhere seen to better advantage than in our\r\nAmerican Holmes.\" This is not to say that Holmes was alone in his\r\nconsciousness of science. Thoreau was fully as aware of it in the field\r\nof plant and animal study; all things considered, Emerson and Whitman\r\nwere more responsive to its deeper spiritual implications. It is rather\r\nthat Holmes had his special avenue of approach through the lore of the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n  [28] Meeting of the American Medical Association, May, 1853. The\r\n       response was a poem.\r\n\r\nThe Boston to which Holmes removed when he began his professional\r\ncareer was all-sufficing to him for the rest of his life. On Beacon\r\nHill, the stronghold of the old social order, there was an eager,\r\noutreaching intellectual life. On its slope was the Boston Athenæum;\r\njust below were the Old Corner Book Store and the little shop\r\nmaintained by Elizabeth Peabody. The theaters were rising at its\r\nfoot. Music was being fostered under the wise persistence of James S.\r\nDwight, Washington Allston was doing the best of his painting, and\r\nthe traditions of good statesmanship were being maintained by men\r\nlike Wendell Phillips and Charles Sumner. To cap all, good-fellowship\r\nreigned and many a quiet dinner became a feast of reason and a flow\r\nof soul. \"Nature and art combined to charm the senses; the equatorial\r\nzone of the system was soothed by well-studied artifices; the faculties\r\nwere off duty, and fell into their natural attitudes; you saw wisdom\r\nin slippers and science in a short jacket.\" Although Holmes discounted\r\nit in the moment of utterance, he was not unfriendly to the dictum:\r\n\"Boston State-house is the Hub of the Solar System. You couldn't\r\npry that out of a Boston man if you had the tire of all creation\r\nstraightened out for a crowbar.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, as the half century of his Boston residence progressed\r\nthere was no waning in the intellectual life. The obvious leaders,\r\nwhose names are known to everyone, were surrounded by a large circle\r\nof thinking men and women. At the corner of the Common, just across\r\nfrom the Statehouse, was the mansion of George Ticknor, then retired\r\nfrom his Harvard professorship but hospitable in the offer of his rich\r\nlibrary to the new generation of scholars. William Ticknor founded a\r\npublishing business into which he soon took young James T. Fields,\r\na house which under various firm names has had a distinguished and\r\nunbroken career. Elizabeth Peabody was a radioactive center of all\r\nsorts of enterprises and enthusiasms--the Pestalozzian Temple School,\r\nthe \"conversations\" on history, the book shop, and the temporary\r\npublishing of the _Dial_. Francis H. Underwood was the untiring\r\nchampion of the idea which with perfect unselfishness he handed over to\r\nthe abler founders of the _Atlantic Monthly_. And scores of others with\r\nless definite fruits of no less definite interest in life talked well\r\nand listened well and wrote well for the passing reader of the day.\r\n\r\nIn this community Holmes early took his place as the accepted humorist,\r\nand for the first twenty-five years he wrote almost entirely in verse.\r\nThe fact that two of his earliest and most famous poems were anything\r\nbut funny reënforces the point rather than gainsays it. For the\r\nhumorist, in contrast to the joker, is a serious man with a special\r\nmethod which he employs usually but not always. If Holmes had not been\r\ncapable of blazing with the indignation of \"Old Ironsides\" or glowing\r\nwith the sympathy of \"The Last Leaf,\" he would have been a clever\r\ndispenser of jollities but not a commentator on life. Much of his\r\nyouthful composition was of the lighter variety--pleasant extravagances\r\non the level of the \"Croaker Papers,\" not quite up to _Salmagundi_ (see\r\npp. 116, 134). \"The Music Grinders,\" \"The Comet,\" \"Daily Trials,\" and\r\n\"The Stethoscope Song\" belong in this class. More humorous and less\r\njocose are the verse with a definite satirical turn. \"The Ballad of the\r\nOysterman\" was a gibe at the sentimental lays to be found in all the\r\nAnnuals. \"My Aunt\" hit off the Apollinean Institute type of Young Lady\r\nFinishing School to which he returned in a chapter of \"Elsie Venner\";\r\nthe sort of subject to which he returned too in his shafts at the\r\nLatter-Day Adventists, in \"Latter-Day Warnings,\" and at the decline of\r\nCalvinism, in \"The Deacon's Masterpiece.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time Holmes won a place as the local laureate,--for his\r\nclass of 1829, for Harvard, and for every kind of occasion, grave and\r\ngay, on which some appropriate verse could point a moral and adorn the\r\nprogram. This is an easy accomplishment for those who have the gift,\r\nbut both difficult and dull in the hands of many a poet who is capable\r\nof higher things. It demands fluency of pen, ready inventiveness,\r\ninformality, and a confident good humor in its oral delivery. These all\r\nbelonged to Holmes, and not least of them a gracious social manner.\r\nIt is far easier to depreciate this kind of verse than it is to be\r\nconsistently effective in it.\r\n\r\nTwice in his early maturity he wrote in verse on the theory of poetry.\r\nThe first, in 1836, when he was entering the medical profession, was\r\nhis Phi Beta Kappa poem \"Poetry\"; the second was \"Urania,\" in 1846,\r\nshortly before he accepted his Harvard professorship. The object of\r\n\"Poetry,\" he wrote in a preface for its publication, was \"to express\r\nsome general truths on the sources and the machinery of poetry; to\r\nsketch some changes which may be said to have taken place in its\r\nhistory, constituting four grand eras; and to point out some less\r\nobvious manifestations of the poetic principle.\" In old age he looked\r\nback on this ambitious early effort with kindly indulgence, and\r\nallowed it to stand as a matter of biographical interest, although\r\nit was so evidently the product \"of a young person trained after the\r\nschools of classical English verse as represented by Pope, Goldsmith,\r\nand Campbell, with whose lines his memory was early stocked.\" When,\r\nhowever, he wrote \"Urania, a Rhymed Lesson\" he wore a friendly smile\r\nand did his teaching in a less didactic way. He knew his audience, he\r\nsaid, and he knew that they all expected to be amused.\r\n\r\n      I know a tailor, once a friend of mine,\r\n      Expects great doings in the button line,--\r\n      For mirth's concussions rip the outward case,\r\n      And plant the stitches in a tenderer place,\r\n      I know my audience,--these shall have their due;\r\n      A smile awaits them ere my song is through!\r\n\r\nBut, he went on to say, he knew himself, too, and he proposed no more\r\nto be the buffoon than to be the savage satirist. Beneath his smiles\r\nthere was a kindly seriousness. A dozen years later, in the fifth of\r\nthe \"Autocrat\" papers, he put the case in a little allegory, the end of\r\nwhich is worth quoting in full:\r\n\r\n  The stone is ancient error. The grass is human nature borne down\r\n  and bleached of all its color by it. The shapes which are found\r\n  beneath are the crafty beings which thrive in darkness, and the\r\n  weaker organisms kept helpless by it. He who turns the stone over is\r\n  whosoever puts the staff of truth to the old lying incubus, no matter\r\n  whether he do it with a serious face or a laughing one. The next year\r\n  stands for the coming time. Then shall the nature which had lain\r\n  blanched and broken rise in its full stature and native hues in the\r\n  sunshine. Then shall God's minstrels build their nests in the hearts\r\n  of a new-born humanity. Then shall beauty--Divinity taking outlines\r\n  and color--light upon the souls of men as the butterfly, image of the\r\n  beatified spirit rising from the dust, soars from the shell that held\r\n  a poor grub, which would never have found wings, had not the stone\r\n  been lifted.\r\n\r\nBy these stages, then, Holmes concluded that he was an essayist and\r\ndeveloped into one. The \"Poetry\" of 1836 was entitled \"A Metrical\r\nEssay,\" and it was, without intending to be, distinctly prosaic.\r\n\"Urania,\" of 1846, was self-described as \"A Rhymed Lesson\" and\r\naffected to be nothing more. At last \"The Autocrat of the Breakfast\r\nTable\"--adopting the title and the form of an unsuccessful beginning\r\nin the _New England Magazine_ of 1831-1832--resorted frankly to prose\r\nand achieved a wider reputation for Holmes than all the foregoing verse\r\nhad done.[29] The young person trained through the reading of Pope,\r\nGoldsmith, and Campbell was in the end fitted to do his best work after\r\nthe manner of Addison, Goldsmith, and Lamb. From the appearance of \"The\r\nAutocrat\" Holmes's verse was subordinated in bulk and importance to his\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n  [29] For a direct statement on the resumption of the old attempt,\r\n       see \"The Autocrat's Autobiography\" printed as a foreword to\r\n       the volume. For an indirect account, see the passages on Byles\r\n       Gridley and his \"Thoughts on the Universe\" in Holmes's \"The\r\n       Guardian Angel.\"\r\n\r\nWith his assumption of the _Atlantic_ editorship, Lowell had set the\r\nprime condition that Holmes should become a regular contributor, and\r\nit is evident from the motto on the title page, \"Every man his own\r\nBoswell,\" that Holmes's conversation had furnished the suggestion\r\nfor the series. The vehicle was perfectly adapted to the load it was\r\ndevised to carry. The introduction of a chief spokesman in a loosely\r\norganized group made way for the casual drift from topic to topic.\r\nThe accident of a boarding-house selection justified the domination\r\nby one speaker which would have been unnatural in any social group.\r\nThe continuity of the group gave a chance for characterization and for\r\nthe spinning of a slight narrative thread comparable to those on which\r\nthe _Citizen of the World_ and the \"De Coverley Papers\" were strung.\r\nAnd the chief speaker, autocrat that he was, could give vent to his\r\nthoughts on the universe without let or hindrance, and when the whim\r\nseized him could impose his latest poems upon his always tolerant and\r\nusually deferential fellow-boarders. From the publication of the first\r\nnumber Lowell's judgment was vindicated, with the result not only that\r\nthe Autocrat spoke through twelve issues, but that the thread of his\r\ndiscourse was continued with \"The Professor at the Breakfast-Table,\" in\r\n1859, was resumed with \"The Poet at the Breakfast-Table,\" in 1871, and\r\nwas not concluded until the conversations \"Over the Teacups,\" in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe range of topics cannot be better shown than by reference to the\r\nindex--and the original edition was extraordinary in its day for having\r\none. The \"A's,\" for example, include abuse of all good attempts,\r\naffinities, and antipathies, age, animal under air-pump, the American a\r\nreënforced Englishman, the effect of looking at the Alps, the power of\r\nseeing analogies, why anniversaries are dreaded by the professor, the\r\narguments which spoil conversation, the forming American aristocracy,\r\nthe use of stimulants by artists, the effect of meeting one of heaven's\r\nassessors, and so on. The order in which they fall is hardly more\r\ncasual than in the index. Witness the eleventh paper: puns, \"The\r\nDeacon's Masterpiece,\" slang, dandies, aristocracy, intellectual green\r\nfruit, Latinized diction (with the verses \"Æstivation\"), seashore and\r\nmountains, summer residences, space, the Alps, moderate wishes (with\r\nthe verses \"Contentment\"), faithfulness in love, picturesque spots in\r\nBoston, natural beauties in a city, dusting a library, experiencing\r\nlife, a proposal of marriage. The difference between their structure\r\nand that of the formal essay is simply that they meander like a stream\r\ninstead of following a predetermined course like a canal.\r\n\r\nIn the later members of the series, and particularly in the\r\nthird and fourth, there is an evident response to the current of\r\nnineteenth-century thinking. By nature Holmes was a liberal but not a\r\nreformer. He took no active part in \"movements,\" though he sympathized\r\nwith many of them and with the intentions of their wiser promoters.\r\nAt the same time he preferred for his own part to induce and persuade\r\npeople into new paths rather than to shock and offend them while they\r\nwere still treading the old ones. There is a note of considerate\r\ncaution in his espousal of new ideas. He was the type of man who will\r\nalways be unsatisfactory to extremists,--a dangerous person to the\r\nhidebound conservative and a tentative trifler to the ultraradical.\r\nHis open-mindedness is charmingly demonstrated in the book of his old\r\nage, \"Over the Teacups.\" Few men of eighty succeed in keeping their\r\neyes off the past and their voices from decrying the present, but\r\nHolmes in his latest years was as interested in the developments of the\r\nday as he had been in the prime of life.\r\n\r\nThe issues of the Civil War--to return from the tea table to the\r\nbreakfast room--showed that Holmes had not lost the spark for righteous\r\nindignation in the thirty years since the writing of \"Old Ironsides.\"\r\n\"The Statesman's Secret\" was not as effective a protest at Webster's\r\n\"Seventh of March Speech\" (1850) as Whittier's \"Ichabod,\" but it was\r\nquite as sincerely outspoken. \"Non-Resistance\" and \"The Moral Bully\"\r\nprove that Holmes was as little of a peace-at-any-price man as Lowell.\r\n\"Brother Jonathan's Lament for Sister Caroline\" was written in deep\r\nsorrow that the war had been precipitated, but \"To Canaan\" was militant\r\nto the highest degree. Two other poems, written in the years of the\r\nAutocrat and the Poet, both in lofty seriousness, came from \"flowering\r\nmoments of the mind\" which lost fewest petals as they were recorded in\r\nverse. These were \"The Chambered Nautilus\" and \"A Sun-Day Hymn.\"\r\n\r\nIn all Holmes's writing, whatever the mood or the form, the prevailing\r\nmethod is cumulative. He is likely to start with an idea, proceed to a\r\nsimple analysis of it, and expound it by a single analogy elaborated at\r\nlength or a whole series of them more briefly presented. In the sixth\r\n\"Autocrat\" paper he says, with some show of self-restraint, \"There are\r\nsome curious observations I should like to make ... but I think we are\r\ngetting rather didactic.\" Yet as a matter of fact Holmes's method was\r\nseldom anything but didactic, and his content was frequently such. He\r\nevidently saw at a flash how to communicate the idea, but, as he must\r\nhave done hundreds of times in the classroom, he developed it with\r\nwhat was at once spontaneous and painstaking detail. His most famous\r\nsatires, \"My Aunt,\" \"Contentment,\" and \"The Deacon's Masterpiece,\" are\r\nall illustrations of this method. Thus in his \"Farewell to Agassiz,\"\r\nbefore the naturalist left for South America, Holmes mentioned that\r\nthe mountains were awaiting his approval, as were also five other\r\nnatural objects. He wished the traveler safety from the tropical sun\r\nand twenty-two other dangers and that he might succeed in finding\r\nfossils and seven other things of interest. \"Bill and Joe\" contains\r\nsixty lines built up by the enumerative method on the truth that\r\nworldly distinctions disappear for a moment in the light of college\r\nfriendships. \"Dorothy Q\" devotes thirty-two lines to the quaint\r\nfancy \"What would I be if one of my eight great, great grandmothers\r\nhad married another man?\" and \"The Broomstick Train\" a hundred and\r\nforty-six lines to the conceit \"The Salem Witches furnish the power for\r\nthe trolley cars.\" In prose, as a final illustration, his well-known\r\ndiscussion of the typical lecture audience in the sixth \"Autocrat\" is\r\nabout eight hundred words long: Audiences help formulate lectures.\r\nThe average is not high. They are awful in their uniformity--like\r\ncommunities of ants or bees--whether in New York, Ohio, or New\r\nEngland--unless some special principle of selection interferes. They\r\ninclude fixed elements--in age (four)--and in intelligence (the dull\r\nelaborated)--making up a compound vertebrate (biological analogy).\r\nKindly elements conceded, but on the whole depressing.\r\n\r\nHolmes gave the final epithet to his novels when he referred to them\r\nas \"medicated.\" For the other and more eminent American physician,\r\nWeir Mitchell, fiction was a resort to another world, but the\r\nauthor of \"Elsie Venner\" (1861), \"The Guardian Angel\" (1867), and\r\n\"The Mortal Antipathy\" (1885) was the essayist-physician extending\r\nthe narrative process a little farther than in the conversational\r\nseries. The plots were supplied by Dr. Holmes and developed by the\r\nAutocrat-Professor-Poet. Several chapters of medical lore were\r\ninterpolated in each book, and several more of genial exposition.\r\nThese latter are like the work of Mrs. Stowe except that their\r\nrelation to story development is tenuous or imperceptible, and in\r\ncharacterization his successes, like Mrs. Stowe's, are with the\r\nhomelier New England types.\r\n\r\nIn the best sense of the word Holmes was a provincial New Englander. He\r\nwas proud of the traditions of his district, devoted to its welfare,\r\ncertain of its capacity for improvement, but sure of its contribution\r\nto the integrity of American character. Although he did not share the\r\ndeeper enthusiasms of Emerson or even fully understand them, he had\r\nmuch more of the milk of human kindness in him. His \"message\" and his\r\nmanner of delivering it were popular with the reading public. He was\r\nnot a leader, but he kept up to the times, and he explained the drift\r\nof them to many who might not otherwise have perceived what was going\r\non in the world or in themselves. In the tributes which came from every\r\nquarter after his death his geniality was the highest common factor--a\r\nwholesome and homely trait which will always be sure of affectionate\r\nregard in American literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.

Other conspicuous\r\nrepresentatives were Bayard Taylor (1825-1878), Richard Henry Stoddard\r\n(1825-1903), Edmund Clarence Stedman (1833-1908), Thomas Bailey Aldrich\r\n(1836-1907) in his early career, and--with a difference--Richard Watson\r\nGilder (1844-1909). None of these men was born and brought up in New\r\nYork, and none but Gilder partook of the nature of the town as Irving\r\nand even Bryant and Halleck had been able to do in the preceding\r\ngeneration when it was more compact and unified. Taylor clung to the\r\nidea of establishing a manorial estate at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania,\r\nbut lived more or less in New York and buzzed restlessly about the\r\nliterary market until he died a victim of overwork in 1878. Stoddard,\r\nmore stable and unexcited than Taylor or than Stedman, was occupied\r\nin a succession of uninspired literary ventures. Aldrich, after a\r\nfew years, returned to Boston, where he was happier, although always\r\nconsciously a newcomer. Stedman devoted as much time and energy to\r\npoetry as his unsuccessful efforts to become independently rich would\r\nallow him. These men were in a way the first American literary victims\r\nto \"Newyorkitis.\" Only Richard Watson Gilder succeeded in coping with\r\nthe great city. The others were not only unable to impress their stamp\r\non the city of their adoption but were engulfed by it. In the midst of\r\nthe turmoil they could not enjoy the serenity which prevailed in those\r\nsame days in the Boston or the Charleston where cultural pursuits were\r\nheld in higher esteem than commercial activity.\r\n\r\nThey were in the midst of a different cultural atmosphere. Bryant,\r\nIrving, Halleck, and Greeley led the way for a succeeding group of\r\nself-educated men. The New England writers of the day had been schooled\r\nat Harvard and Bowdoin and certain German universities, and the\r\ncultured men of Charleston were going abroad for study and travel in\r\nincreasing numbers. In the midst of all the hurly-burly of New York\r\nthere was no dominant circle who were disposed to take time for the\r\nleisurely contemplation of the finer things in art and life, and the\r\nart and life of New York suffered in consequence. In spite of all that\r\nhad been said for generations about the employment of American subject\r\nmatter, these men turned away from either the romance or the realities\r\nof the town. Except in rare instances they did not even satirize it.\r\nInstead they took refuge in sentimentalism and in remote times and\r\nplaces. \"The Ballad of Babie Bell,\" \"Ximen, or the Battle of the\r\nSierra Morena, and Other Poems,\" \"Poems of the Orient,\" \"The Blameless\r\nPrince,\" \"Poems Lyric and Idyllic,\" \"Königsmark, and Other Poems,\" \"The\r\nKing's Bell,\" and \"The Book of the East\" were the natural output of\r\nsuch a group. Moreover, the plays were of the same sort. \"Tortesa the\r\nUsurer,\" \"The Merchant of Bogota,\" \"Francesca da Rimini,\" and \"Leonora,\r\nor the World's Own\" represented the majority. \"Fashion\" and \"Rip Van\r\nWinkle\" were quite the exceptions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf his generation Stoddard was perhaps more devoted than any other\r\nin his worship of a fanciful and unvitalized Muse. The criticisms of\r\nLowell and Holmes served as correctives for the artificialities of\r\nStedman and Aldrich, but Stoddard made no poetic response either to the\r\nCivil War or to the march of science or to the religious changes that\r\nattended it. To the end of his career he was the complete product of\r\nthe influences surrounding his youth. He had been brought to New York\r\nat the age of ten by his widowed mother and kept in school only until\r\nhe was fifteen. For nine years he worked as an artisan, cultivating\r\nliterature and literary people in his leisure hours. From 1853 to 1870\r\nhe held a post in the New York Customhouse, and from 1860 on, literary\r\neditorships with the _New York World_, the _Aldine_ and the _New York\r\nMail and Express_.\r\n\r\nStoddard's poetry is altogether detached from this life, ignoring or\r\navoiding the facts of daily existence; and even in the little lyrics of\r\npleasure there is the lovely detachment of the orchid. Though now and\r\nagain they show signs of becoming mildly erotic, they have no passion\r\nin them. Rather they exhibit the chaste delights of the virtuoso, who\r\ntakes up one object after another from the glass-covered cabinets in\r\nthe museum which his fancy has furnished, looks it over fondly, admires\r\nits form and color, and sets it back with even pulse until such time as\r\nhe shall choose to gaze on it again. These lyrics are sometimes nature\r\ndescriptions and sometimes nature fantasies. Often they are about the\r\nidea of love--rather than about love itself--and about wine--but not\r\nabout conviviality. In the philosophical ones there is a negative tone,\r\nas in\r\n\r\n      Man loses but the life he lives\r\n        And only lives the life he loses.\r\n\r\nor in\r\n\r\n      There is no life on land or sea\r\n      Save in the quiet moon and me;\r\n      Nor ours is true, but only seems\r\n      Within some dead old World of Dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd this dream world was an abandoned unreality and not a hope for\r\nsomething better.\r\n\r\nTaken at its best, his verse is chiefly excellent for its form. As it\r\ndoes not spring from any vivid experiencing of life, it is conventional\r\nand reminiscent rather than spontaneous and original. It suggests many\r\nmeasures from many periods. In only a few poems, which purport to be\r\nthemselves imitations from the East, he writes what seems fresh and\r\nnew. His real gift was in the composition of little poetic cameos,\r\nbits of from four to a dozen lines, the dainty ornaments of literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe career of Thomas Bailey Aldrich was closely interwoven with the\r\nwhole fabric of professional authorship in America. Like Bryant and\r\nWillis before him, and like Stedman, Stoddard, and Winter of his own\r\ngeneration, he established himself in New York, although he was a\r\nNew England boy; but unlike all the others he fulfilled his career\r\nin Boston. It was an accident of dollars and cents that kept him out\r\nof Harvard and put him into a New York office. A love of literature\r\nled him then successively into the adventurous byways of Bohemian New\r\nYork, the secure dignity of magazine editorship in Boston, and the fair\r\nprospects of independent literary success as enjoyed on Beacon Hill.\r\n\r\nTo be explicit, he was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1836. His\r\nfather's pursuit of fortune took Aldrich as a child to many parts of\r\nthe country, but brought him back to Portsmouth at the age of thirteen.\r\nFor the next three years he lived there the life which provided the\r\nbasic facts for \"The Story of a Bad Boy.\" Lack of funds prevented\r\nhis entering Harvard, and in 1852 he undertook a clerkship in the\r\noffice of a New York uncle. In 1855, when he was still only nineteen,\r\nhe published his first volume of poetry and became junior literary\r\ncritic on the _Evening Mirror_. In the next several years he held a\r\nsub-editorship in New York on the _Home Journal_ and the _Saturday\r\nPress_ and literary adviserships to several minor publishing houses,\r\ncapping off with the editorship of the _Illustrated News_, which had\r\nbecome a thing of the past when, in 1866, he was called to Boston to\r\nbecome editor of _Every Saturday_. This post he held for nine years.\r\nFor the six years up to 1881 he was an abundant contributor to the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_ and for the next nine, 1881-1890, he was the editor.\r\nDuring the remainder of his life he held no literary position.\r\n\r\nDuring his fifteen years in New York, Greeley and Bryant, two newspaper\r\neditors, were perhaps the dominant figures in the literary and\r\nintellectual stratum, Willis and Halleck the most popular, Henry Clapp,\r\nJr., and Charles T. Congdon the cleverest, and \"Bohemia,\" with its\r\nrallying point at Pfaff's restaurant, the visible rallying place for\r\nthe authors.[30] Aldrich gravitated toward this group, but never really\r\nbelonged to it. Just why he did not can be inferred from a sentence by\r\nHowells, whose nature was very like his own: \"I remember that, as I sat\r\nat that table, under the pavement, in Pfaff's beer-cellar, and listened\r\nto the wit that did not seem very funny, I thought of the dinner with\r\nLowell, the breakfast with Fields, the supper at the Autocrat's, and\r\nfelt that I had fallen very far.\"[31]\r\n\r\n  [30] For varying sentiments about \"Bohemia\" see the following\r\n       passages: Ferris Greenslet, \"Life of Thomas Bailey Aldrich,\" pp.\r\n       37-47; W. D. Howells, \"Literary Friends and Acquaintances,\" pp.\r\n       68-76; Stedman and Gould, \"Life of Edmund Clarence Stedman,\" pp.\r\n       208, 209; William Winter, \"Old Friends,\" pp. 291-297.\r\n\r\n  [31] In reply to this and like passages William Winter wrote:\r\n       \"No literary circle comparable with the Bohemian group of\r\n       that period, in ardor of genius, variety of character, and\r\n       singularity of achievement, has since existed in New York, nor\r\n       has any group of writers anywhere existent in our country been\r\n       so ignorantly and grossly misrepresented and maligned\" (\"Old\r\n       Friends,\" p. 138).\r\n\r\nThe men who gathered at Pfaff's were very conscious of Boston, though\r\ntheir consciousness came out in various ways. The most violent said\r\nthat the thought of it made them as ugly as sin; others loved it\r\nthough they left it, as Whitman did \"the open road\"; and some, on the\r\noutskirts of \"Bohemia,\" were not too aggressively like Stedman, who\r\nadmitted much later, \"I was very anxious to bring out my first book\r\nin New York in Boston style, having a reverence for Boston, which I\r\ncontinued to have.\" Aldrich was of like mind, and readily accepted\r\nOsgood's invitation to \"the Hub\" and to the editorship of _Every\r\nSaturday_. Years after he wrote to Bayard Taylor, who could understand:\r\n\"I miss my few dear friends in New York--but that is all. There is a\r\nfiner intellectual atmosphere here than in our city.... The people of\r\nBoston are full-blooded _readers_, appreciative, trained.\" And later,\r\nto Stedman: \"In the six years I have been here, I have found seven or\r\neight hearts so full of noble things that there is no room in them for\r\nsuch trifles as envy and conceit and insincerity. I didn't find more\r\nthan two or three such in New York, and I lived there fifteen years. It\r\nwas an excellent school for me--to get out of!\" Boston was his native\r\nheath, in spite of his own saying: \"Though I am not genuine Boston, I\r\nam Boston-plated.\"\r\n\r\nAldrich's literary career began and ended with the writing of poetry,\r\nbut what he did in the interims of poetical silence contributed to\r\nthe peculiar character of his work even though it was a source of\r\ndistraction and sometimes of prolonged interruption. As a reader and\r\neditor he was schooled from very young manhood in the exercise of a\r\npeculiarly fine artistic taste, a taste so exacting in detail that the\r\n_Atlantic_ under his direction was described by a foreign critic as\r\n\"the best edited magazine in the English language.\" He did not reserve\r\nthe exercise of this rectitude of judgment for the work of others,\r\nbut applied it with perhaps increased austerity to himself. His verse\r\nwill consequently endure close examination, and the later collections\r\nwill show the virtues and defects of scrupulous rejection and of the\r\nrevision in each succeeding publication of the work which he chose to\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of work so carefully perfected are evident. His effects\r\nare, in the end, all calculated, for he gave no quarter to what he had\r\nproduced with zest if it did not ring true to his critical ear. His\r\npoetic machinery is therefore well oiled and articulated. His metaphors\r\nare sound and his diction happily adjusted. \"The vanilla-flavored\r\nadjectives and the patchouli-scented participles\" criticized by his\r\nkindly senior, Dr. Holmes, are pared away. So in the little steel\r\nengravings that are the best expressions of his peculiar talent there\r\nis a fine simplicity, but it is the simplicity of an accomplished\r\nwoman of the world rather than of a village maid. And herein lie\r\nthe shortcomings of Aldrich's poetry--that it is the poetry of\r\naccomplishment. As a youth in New York, writing while Halleck's\r\npopularity was at its height, he was not independent enough to be more\r\noriginal than his most admired townsman. The verses in \"The Bells: a\r\nCollection of Chimes\" are most of them clearly imitative; and from the\r\nday of \"Babie Bell\" on, whatever of originality was Aldrich's belonged\r\nto the library and the drawing-room and the literary club rather than\r\nto the seas, woods, and mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is logical, then, that his longer narrative poems have least of his\r\nown stamp in them. From a literary point of view they are well enough,\r\nbut they are literary grass of the field and have no more claim on the\r\nprimary attention of a modern reader than do the bulk of prose short\r\nstories written in the same years by Aldrich and his fellows. The\r\nonly one that stands out is \"Pauline Pavlovna,\" and that because it\r\nhas the dramatic vigor and the startling unexpectedness of conclusion\r\nwhich mark the best of his prose tales. It is logical, too, that in\r\nhis more ambitious odes--such as \"Spring in New England\" and the \"Shaw\r\nMemorial Ode,\" which open and close the second volume of his poems--he\r\ndid not appear to the best advantage. Memorials of the Civil War are\r\nadequate only if written with epic vision, but the best that Aldrich\r\ndid with such material was to make it the ground for heartfelt tributes\r\nto the nobility of his fallen friends. Read Moody's \"Ode in Time of\r\nHesitation\" beside Aldrich's slender lyric based on the same man and\r\nthe same memorial, and the difference is self-evident. Aldrich's\r\nbiographer has commented on the rarity of his æsthetic sense, \"among\r\nmodern poets with their preoccupations, philosophical, religious and\r\npolitical.\" In this not unjust criticism of Aldrich--which marks a\r\ndistinction rather than a superiority--lies the reason why he should\r\nhave left the writing of national odes to poets who were sometimes\r\ncapable of such preoccupation.\r\n\r\nIn writing on personal and local and occasional themes Aldrich dealt\r\nwith more congenial material. When celebrating his fellow-authors and\r\nthe places he loved he could invoke beauty with an unpreoccupied mind;\r\nand he did so with unvarying success, addressing the choicest of the\r\nlimited public in which he was really interested. The kind of folk he\r\ncared for \"Drank deep of life, _new books_ and hearts of men,\" like\r\nHenry Howard Brownell. As a youth he wrote delightedly of a certain\r\nmonth when he could see \"her\" every day and browse in a library of\r\nten thousand volumes. He was a literary poet for literary people. As\r\nsuch he was most successful in poems which ranged in length from the\r\nsonnet to the quatrain. In the tiny bits like \"Destiny,\" \"Heredity,\"\r\n\"Identity,\" \"Memory,\" \"I'll not confer with Sorrow,\" \"Pillared Arch\r\nand Sculptured Tower,\" he achieved works as real as Benvenuto's jewel\r\nsettings. It was a fulfillment of the wish recorded in his \"Lyrics and\r\nEpics\":\r\n\r\n      I would be the lyric\r\n      Ever on the lip,\r\n      Rather than the epic\r\n      Memory lets slip.\r\n      I would be the diamond\r\n      At my lady's ear\r\n      Rather than a June rose\r\n      Worn but once a year.\r\n\r\nNo more charming tribute was ever paid Aldrich than this of Whittier's\r\nnarrated by a friend who had been visiting for a week with the poet in\r\nhis old age: \"Every evening he asked me to repeat to him certain short\r\npoems, often 'Destiny,' and once even 'that audacious \"Identity,\"'\r\nas he called it; but at the end he invariably said, 'Now thee knows\r\nwithout my saying so that I want \"Memory,\"' and with his wonderful\r\nfar-off gaze he always repeated after me: 'Two petals from that\r\nwild-rose tree.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his address at a meeting held in memory of Edmund Clarence Stedman\r\nin January, 1909, Hamilton Mabie struck the main note in two\r\ncomplementary statements: \"Mr. Stedman belongs with those who have not\r\nonly enriched literature with works of quality and substance, but who\r\nhave represented it in its public relationships,\" and, \"Stedman was\r\nby instinct and temperament a man of the town.\" He elected to live in\r\nManhattan just as deliberately as Aldrich elected to live in Boston;\r\nand in this distinction lies something much broader than the mere\r\ndifference between the two men.\r\n\r\nStedman was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1833. After the death\r\nof his father and the remarriage of his mother, he was brought up\r\nfrom 1839 to 1850 under charge of an uncle. A member of the class of\r\n1853 at Yale, he was \"rusticated\" (see p. 282) and then expelled for\r\npersistent misbehavior. Until 1863 he was in journalism, as petty\r\nproprietor in two Connecticut towns, and later as member of the _New\r\nYork Tribune_ staff, ending with two years as war correspondent. In\r\n1863 he went into Wall Street, and in 1869 became a member of the New\r\nYork Stock Exchange. From this date to the end of his life in 1908 he\r\nknew little real repose, oscillating from over-exertion in business to\r\nover-exertion in writing, with occasional enforced vacations. His work\r\nas poet was inseparable from his labors as editor and critic. In this\r\nfield he wrote \"Victorian Poets,\" 1875, \"Poets of America,\" 1885, and\r\n\"The Nature and Elements of Poetry,\" 1892; and edited the \"Library of\r\nAmerican Literature\" (with Ellen Hutchinson) 1888-1889, \"A Victorian\r\nAnthology,\" 1895, and \"An American Anthology,\" 1900.\r\n\r\nStedman took the consequences of settling in the commercial capital\r\nof the United States. While the members of the Saturday Club were\r\nlending distinction to Boston, the members of the Ornithorhyncus Club\r\nand the Bohemians were receiving the impress of New York. Men came\r\nto the Saturday luncheons from Salem and Haverhill, Concord, and\r\nCambridge as well as near-by Brookline and Boston itself, but the New\r\nYork groups congregated into literary neighborhoods in the \"Unitary\r\nHome\" or \"on the south side of Tenth Street.\" Thus it came about that\r\nAldrich contributed to Boston what he brought there, but that Stedman\r\nwas \"made in New York.\" As a result Aldrich was more frankly absorbed\r\nin the concerns of the enlightened reader, and Stedman relatively\r\nmore interested in a broader society. Both were war correspondents,\r\nbut Aldrich admitted the war into his poetry only rarely, and then\r\nwithout much success. On the other hand, the first eighth of Stedman's\r\ncollected poems are entitled \"In War Time,\" and with the poems of\r\nManhattan, of New England, and of special occasions amount to nearly\r\none half the volume. Moreover, of the poems by Stedman which are\r\ngenerally known and quoted, quite the larger portion are included\r\nin utterances which are representative of literature \"in its public\r\nrelationships.\"\r\n\r\nA timely admonition from Lowell, as valuable as the one from Holmes to\r\nAldrich, helped keep him out of the byways in which he was inclined to\r\nstray. In 1866 Stedman was proud of his \"Alectryon,\" a blank-verse poem\r\non a classic theme which had appeared in one of his books three years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n  When Mr. Lowell praised the volume in _The North American Review_ I\r\n  was chagrined that he did not allude to my _pièce de résistance_,\r\n  and finally hinted as much to him. He at once said that it was my\r\n  \"best piece of work,\" but \"no addition to poetic literature,\" since\r\n  we already have enough masterpieces of that kind--from Landor's\r\n  \"Hamadryad\" and Tennyson's \"OEnone\" down to the latest effort\r\n  by Swinburne or Mr. Fields. So I have never written since upon an\r\n  antique theme. Upon reflection, I thought Lowell right. A new land\r\n  calls for new song.\r\n\r\nThe best of Stedman's nature poems are directly drawn from boyhood\r\nreminiscence or from a voyage and vacation in the West Indies, and many\r\nof his songs and ballads are derived from contemporary backgrounds and\r\nepisodes.\r\n\r\nStedman did his work as a poet, however, in full consciousness of all\r\nthe wealth of continental literature and the splendors of Old World\r\ntradition. Perhaps there was no single work into which he put more\r\nambition than into his uncompleted metrical version from the Greek of\r\nthe Sicilian Idyllists. His \"Victorian Poets\" and the anthology which\r\nfollowed were undertaken by way of making a workmanlike approach to the\r\npoetry of his own countrymen. As a reader he had the scholar's attitude\r\ntoward literature; as a poet he felt a respect approaching reverence\r\nfor the established traditions of his art. And yet--and in this respect\r\nStedman is lamentably rare among critics and artists--his conviction\r\nthat the centuries had achieved permanent canons for the poetic art\r\ndid not lead him into slashing abuse of those who dissented from his\r\nviews. He wrote no single essay which better demonstrated his wisdom,\r\nhis sanity, and his charming suavity of mind and manner than his\r\ndiscussion of Walt Whitman. Although he felt a native distaste for much\r\nof Whitman's writing and for the way most of it was done, he succeeded\r\nin applying a fair mode of criticism, and he did it in the manner of\r\nan artist and not as a counsel for the plaintiff. Instead of beginning\r\nwith cleverness and ending with truculence Stedman did himself the\r\nhonor of coming out magnanimously with \"... there is something of the\r\nGreek in Whitman, and his lovers call him Homeric, but to me he shall\r\nbe our old American Hesiod, teaching us works and days.\" The measure\r\nof Stedman's poetry should therefore be made in the light of two\r\ncharacteristics: his instinctive and temperamental love of the town,\r\nas this determined his choice of subject matter, and his widely read\r\nappreciation of the older poets, as this affected his sense of artistic\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of it was very popular at the moment and not altogether\r\nnegligible to-day, his less important work was the succession of verses\r\nwhich were written in the spirit and, in some cases, at the speed of\r\nthe journalist. \"The Diamond Wedding,\" for example, was done in an\r\nevening and was the talk of the town thirty-six hours later. But, more\r\nthan that, it was actually good satire,--as good a piece of its kind\r\nas had appeared in New York since Halleck's \"Fanny.\" So, too, \"Israel\r\nFreyer's Bid for Gold\" was published three days after the idea had\r\nfirst occurred to him. These, like the \"Ballad of Lager Bier\" and \"The\r\nPrince's Ball\" and even \"How Old Brown Took Harper's Ferry\" represented\r\nthe high spirit of youth rollicking on paper in the fashion of the\r\nyoung authors of the \"Salmagundi\" and \"Croaker\" satires.\r\n\r\n\"Bohemia\" and \"Pan in Wall Street,\" though composed in this same\r\ngeneral period, are far more sober, deliberate, and genuinely\r\npoetical. In both Stedman dealt with the romantic rather than with the\r\nridiculous or contemptible in city life. From the years of his work\r\non \"The Victorian Poets\" to the end two developments took place. He\r\ninclined more to refine on the form of his poems, giving over at last\r\nall fluent satire, and he progressed in subject matter, first to what\r\nliterature and the past suggested and then, with advancing years, to\r\nconsiderations of age and death. The changes are not abrupt, but they\r\nare pervasive and evident.\r\n\r\nDuring the last dozen years of his life poetry could not be his natural\r\nform of expression, for the world was too much with him. A great deal\r\nof the time when he was not getting or losing on Change (he seems to\r\nhave lost rather more than he spent) he devoted to service on all\r\nsorts of boards and councils of good works, speaking and versifying\r\nfor special occasions, editing miscellaneously,--even a \"Pocket Guide\r\nto Europe,\"--and giving advice and encouragement to younger poets.\r\nHe was admirably representing literature in its public relationships\r\nand paying the price which is always exacted of an ambassador of\r\nany sort in the complete sacrifice of independent leisure. There is\r\nsomething pathetic in his oft-repeated protests in these latter years\r\nat being called a \"banker-poet\" or \"broker-poet,\" for he had failed\r\nto become rich as he had hoped, and he had enjoyed on the whole less\r\nsecurity than many of his acquaintances who had attached themselves to\r\nliterature in some professional way. This, however, had been a mistake\r\nnot so much of judgment as of temperament. Unless his voluminous\r\nbiography utterly misrepresents him he had no true capacity for\r\nleisure. He was an intellectual flagellant; and his poetry, although\r\nhe was in theory devoted to it, was in reality a proof of the love of\r\nart which continually tantalized and distracted him but never won his\r\ncomplete allegiance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRichard Watson Gilder was born in Bordentown, New Jersey, in 1844. He\r\nstudied there in Bellevue Seminary, founded by his father, intending\r\nto practice law. He was in brief active service during the war when\r\nPennsylvania was invaded. On his father's death he entered journalistic\r\nwork, first with two Newark newspapers and then with _Hours at Home_\r\nin New York. From its founding in 1870 he was associate editor of the\r\nold _Scribner's Monthly_ (since 1881 _The Century_) and from 1881 was\r\nits editor in chief. He became increasingly important in New York\r\nas contributor to civic welfare, and at the same time held his own\r\nas editor and poet. Thus he was first president of the Kindergarten\r\nAssociation of New York and a founder of the Authors' Club. He was\r\nidentified with the leading agencies for cultural and humanitarian\r\nends, was in demand as laureate on special occasions, and was recipient\r\nof many honorary degrees.\r\n\r\nGilder was almost exclusively a lyric poet. His units are very\r\nbrief,--there are more than five hundred in the one-volume \"Complete\"\r\nedition,--very few extending to the one hundred lines ordained by Poe.\r\nEven among lyrics, moreover, he set distinct boundaries to his field.\r\nAmong his metropolitan fellows--Taylor, Stoddard, Aldrich, Stedman, and\r\nthe others--he was notable in not writing imitative and reminiscent\r\npoetry. These men must have been rather definitely in the back of his\r\nmind when he wrote:\r\n\r\n      Some from books resound their rhymes--\r\n        Set them ringing with a faint,\r\n        Sorrowful, and sweet, and quaint\r\n      Memory of the olden times,\r\n      Like the sound of evening chimes.\r\n\r\nAnd too many of his contemporaries did not follow as well as he the\r\nadmonition,\r\n\r\n            Tell to the wind\r\n      Thy private woes, but not to human ear.\r\n\r\nThere was still a world of beauty left for him, first of all in songs\r\nof love. It is a chaste and disembodied passion that he celebrated in\r\nfrequent groups of song. The lady is a delight to the eye, modest,\r\ntimid, and yet all-generous; the lover eager, gentle, adoring, and\r\ninspired to nobility. What Gilder recorded in one of the earliest of\r\nthese lyrics seems in large measure to hold true of them all. After an\r\nenumeration of the lady's charms and the charm she bestowed upon earth\r\nand sky, he continued:\r\n\r\n      I love her doubting and anguish;\r\n        I love the love she withholds;\r\n      I love my love that loveth her\r\n        And anew her being molds.\r\n\r\nA poet of so rarefied a sentiment as this hangs on the brink of\r\nsentimentalism, but Gilder seldom fell over, for his nicety of feeling\r\ncould not easily be led into mawkishness.\r\n\r\nHis regard for nature was refined and sophisticated. One passes\r\nfrom the exquisite \"Dawn\" with which his first volume opened, past\r\n\"Thistle-Down\" and \"The Violet\" to the poems of Tyringham, his summer\r\nhome; and then to \"Home Acres\" and \"The Old Place,\" which had no rival;\r\nand ends \"In Helena's Garden\" between \"The Marble Pool\" and \"The\r\nSundial,\" to drink tea with eleven pretty girls at a round table made\r\nfrom a granite millstone. The sun shines brightly, the flowers are in\r\nbloom, their odor mingling with that of the souchong, the conversation\r\nis facile, and everybody is amiable and complacent. From such a\r\ncatalogue one might expect sappy and emasculated nature poems, but once\r\nagain Gilder's sanity rescues him. Even in Helena's garden he is rather\r\na strong man at ease than a sybarite.\r\n\r\nIn his enjoyment of the allied arts his taste was generous. Music\r\nappealed to him most of all. He chanted the praises of Handel and\r\nChopin, Rubinstein and Tschaikowsky, but of Beethoven still more,\r\nand of Wagner most of all. He told of the thrill he caught from the\r\nvarious instruments, but of the deeper thrill from the singer and from\r\nthe chorus. The art of \"Madame Butterfly\" appealed to him, but not so\r\ndeeply as the power of the drama, even if played \"In a little theater,\r\nin the Jewry of the New World.\" Naturally he wrote much of his own art,\r\nrevealing his high seriousness in his poems about the poet. Poetry was\r\nnot solely the record or the evidence of beauty for him. Although his\r\nonly markedly personal allegiance in poetry was an allegiance to Keats,\r\nit was a fealty to Keats taken off before his prime. Gilder lamented\r\nthe wrong fate had done the youthful genius and did not content himself\r\nwith reiterating that \"a thing of beauty is a joy forever.\"\r\n\r\nFor Gilder never, even in his most ecstatic moods, indulged in the\r\nfallacy of setting art above life. Though his work does not show the\r\nmarked changes which have developed in many evolving careers, there is\r\na clear emergence of philosophic and then social and civic interest in\r\nhis progressive volumes. His sense for the need of a brave integrity\r\ncomes to the surface in such poems as \"Reform,\" \"The Prisoner's\r\nThought,\" \"The Heroic Age,\" \"The Demagogue,\" \"The Tool,\" \"The New\r\nPolitician,\" \"The Whisperers,\" and \"In Times of Peace.\" To such themes\r\nas these and to his poems of heroism and of the reunited country Gilder\r\nbrought the same delicacy of touch as to his poems of love and art and\r\nnature, and he brought into view in them the latent vigor which saved\r\nthe others from being merely pink and mellifluous.\r\n\r\nIn poetry written on the scale of Gilder's there is need of finest\r\nworkmanship. There is no chance for Turneresque effects:\r\n\r\n        The foreground golden dirt,\r\n      The sunshine painted with a squirt.\r\n\r\nThese paintings are like miniatures which must submit to scrutiny\r\nunder the reading glass. In this connection his craftsmanship becomes\r\ninteresting in the history of versification. For Gilder was at once\r\na master of the more complex forms of traditional verse and an early\r\nexperimenter in the free, rhythmic forms which are the subject of\r\nspirited controversy to-day. Some rhythmic prose appears in his\r\nearliest volume, but the sonnet prevails at the beginning of his\r\nauthorship, and at the end it almost utterly disappears in favor of\r\nthe freest sort of blank verse, irregular and unrimed iambic measures,\r\npoems which are suggestive of but distinct from Whitman's, and frank\r\nprose-poetry, not even \"shredded prose\"--in the language of Mr.\r\nHowells--but printed in solid paragraphs. Except for the sonnet, Gilder\r\nhad no favorite measure or stanza in his earlier volumes. Few poems are\r\nin exactly similar measures. There are lines of from three to seven\r\nfeet, quatrains of various sorts, and rhythms from that of the heroic\r\ncouplet to that of the so-called Pindaric ode. But whatever the measure\r\nhe adopted, he was scrupulously consistent to it, though he employed\r\nit easily, seldom conceding an awkward or prosaic locution to the\r\nexigencies of lilt or rime. So he seems to have been equally at home in\r\nthe use of sundry forms--in the antiphonal ballad like \"The Voyager,\"\r\nwithin the pale of \"The Sonnet,\" in the anapæstic flow of \"A Song of\r\nEarly Autumn,\" in the swift-moving iambics of \"A Woman's Thought,\" with\r\nits intricate double and triple rimes, or in the psalmlike sibilations\r\nof \"The Whisperers.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Gilder was the philosophy of his most enlightened\r\ncontemporaries. There is in it much of Emerson, whom he called the\r\n\"shining soul\" of the New World, and there is much of Whitman, though\r\nit is not clear whether their likeness does not lie in their common\r\naccord with Emerson rather than in a direct influence from \"the good\r\ngray poet\" to Gilder. The immanence of God in nature and in the heart\r\nof man (see \"The Voice of the Pine\"); the unity of all natural law\r\n(see \"Destiny\"); the conflict between religion and theology (see\r\n\"Credo\"); and a faith in the essentials of democratic life,--these\r\nare the wholesome fundamentals of modern thinking shared alike by\r\nEmerson and Whitman and Gilder. Gilder is not their most impressive\r\nor prophetic expositor. He is a lesser voice in the choir. The\r\npoint of real distinction for him is that he combined so finely the\r\ndiscriminating work of a literary editor with the unwearying life of\r\na good and courageous citizen and still kept the current of his song\r\nserene and clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Authors_=\r\n\r\n  RICHARD HENRY STODDARD.

Certain qualifying facts should be reckoned with in drawing\r\nany deductions. The first and most specific is that Poe, although born\r\nin Boston and largely active in Philadelphia and New York, belongs\r\nto the South. His poems and tales are without time and space, but\r\nhis criticisms are often vigorously sectional; yet he was really\r\nan isolated character, speaking for himself without associates or\r\ndisciples.\r\n\r\nFor the comparative withdrawal of the South during a long period from\r\nthe writing and publishing of poems, essays, and stories, there are\r\ntwo main reasons. One is the general nature of the early settlement\r\n(see pp. 3, 4, 6). The spread of the population over a wide area and\r\nthe consequent lack of large towns gave no encouragement to printers\r\nand publishers before the Revolution and furnished no such gathering\r\nplaces as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Literature, like all the\r\nother arts, thrives best in fellowship. With the Revolution and after\r\nit the richest culture of the South devoted itself to statesmanship\r\nand expressed itself in oratory. John Adams, governmental specialist,\r\nregretted that he had no leisure for the arts (see p. 69), but Thomas\r\nJefferson, his successor in the White House, was a creative educator, a\r\nlinguist, an architect, and not unversed in music. Southern gentlemen\r\nfrom the days of Jefferson and Madison to those of Abraham Lincoln read\r\n\"Mr. Addison\" and \"Mr. Steele\" and \"Mr. Pope,\" fashioned their speech\r\nand writing after those courtly models, and, when they wrote at all,\r\ncirculated their efforts among friends, not submitting them to the\r\nsordid touch of the publisher.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the literary consciousness of the South is shown in the\r\nhistory of the American theater. The earliest performances of which\r\nthere is record were given on Southern estates in the second quarter\r\nof the eighteenth century. The Hallam company of players, arriving\r\nfrom England in 1752, secured their first hearing in Maryland and\r\nVirginia. Smaller Southern communities held their own with New York and\r\nPhiladelphia in the patronage of the stage, while surviving Puritan\r\nprejudice made New England an arid field for the drama until well into\r\nthe next century. Again, the founding of the University of Virginia,\r\npreëminent though not the oldest among Southern colleges, was a doubly\r\nimportant event in American education, for it was first among state\r\nuniversities, with a curriculum recognizing the demands of citizenship,\r\nand it was unique in the beauty of its housing. Finally, journalism was\r\nnot neglected in the South, keeping pace with the progress in the rest\r\nof the country; and the _Southern Literary Messenger_ (1834-1865) held\r\nan enviable place among American periodicals during its thirty years of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 the natural course of events in the South began to develop\r\nliterary centers, of which Charleston, South Carolina, was the most\r\nnotable. At this date William Gilmore Simms (1806-1870) was in the\r\nhigh prime of life and was the unchallenged leader by virtue of age,\r\nliterary achievement, and force of personality. He had appeared before\r\nthe public with two volumes of poems in 1827, without foregoing poetry\r\nhad gone on to prolific writing of adventure stories, and had produced\r\nat the rate of more than a book a year. He was an aboundingly vigorous,\r\nsomewhat turbulent man, with a stimulating gift for talk and a very\r\ngenerous interest in all men of literary feeling and especially in\r\nyounger aspirants. Around him and John Russell, the bookseller, there\r\ngathered by social gravitation a group who became for Charleston\r\nwhat the frequenters of the Old Corner Book Store were to Boston and\r\nrather more than what the \"Bohemians\" of Pfaff's restaurant were to\r\nNew York. Russell's became a rendezvous for the best people during the\r\ndaytimes--perhaps to buy, perhaps only to talk--and in the evenings\r\nthe men gathered in the spirit of a literary club, though without\r\norganization or name. _Russell's Magazine_ was the natural fruit of the\r\ngroup-spirit thus engendered, just as the _Atlantic Monthly_ (see p.\r\n288) was of similar associations in Boston or as the _Dial_ had been of\r\nthe Transcendental Club in 1840 (see p. 195).\r\n\r\nIt was a further consequence of this plowing of the cultural soil that\r\ntwo Charleston boys born in 1829 and 1830 were encouraged as young\r\nmen not only to write but to publish their poems and that one became\r\nthe first editor and the other a frequent contributor to the local\r\nperiodical. These were Henry Timrod and Paul Hamilton Hayne. Of the two\r\nfriends, somewhat as in the case of Halleck and Drake, Timrod, the one\r\nwho showed promise of finer things, was the victim of an early death.\r\nAs a youth he was given to the introspective seriousness and the grave\r\nextravagances of the growing poet--characteristics which are not wholly\r\nsacrificed in the grown poet, as they are in the average \"sensible\"\r\nman. His inclination to extol emotion as an end in itself, however,\r\nwas fostered by a native hospitality toward sentimentalism for which\r\nthere was little to correspond in the more prosaic North. In fact \"the\r\nsusceptibility of early feeling\" which Irving wished to keep alive (see\r\np. 126) and which was the central thread in Jane Austen's \"Sense and\r\nSensibility\" was, and still is, a cue to certain prevailing Southern\r\ntraits. Whatever may have been the origin of Southern speech and\r\nmanners, they have continued in some measure to resemble those which we\r\nassociate with English literature of the mid-eighteenth century. Both\r\nhave a touch of courtly formality, a tendency toward the oratorical\r\nstyle, an explicit insistence on honor and chivalry, a display of\r\ndeference to womanhood and to all beauty, and both are in constant\r\ndanger from the insincerity which besets a speech or a literature which\r\nrelies on conventional phrasing until the original locutions lose their\r\noriginal vitality.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] A corresponding danger on the other hand is that a people who\r\n       abjure all such phrases will abjure also the things for which\r\n       they stand, until they become irredeemably prosaic and matter of\r\n       fact.\r\n\r\nTimrod as a youthful versifier passed through his period of\r\nunconvincing extravagance, and even in his earlier work showed by\r\noccasional flashes that he had his own gift for expression as well\r\nas a receptive mind for poetry. In 1859 his first book of poems was\r\npublished. It had the coveted distinction of the Ticknor and Fields,\r\nBoston, imprint, but it was indubitably the utterance of a Charleston\r\npoet. The sonnet \"I know not why, but all this weary day\" is full of\r\ngenuine feeling, and in its ominous despair foretells the coming war:\r\n\r\n      Now it has been a vessel losing way,\r\n      Rounding a stormy headland; now a gray\r\n      Dull waste of clouds above a wintry main;\r\n      And then, a banner, drooping in the rain,\r\n      And meadows beaten into bloody clay.\r\n\r\nTimrod's two greater poems were dedicated to the Confederacy. They are\r\nthe outpourings of loyalty to the shortlived nation, full of passion,\r\nno freer from hate and recrimination than the average poems from the\r\nNorth, but positive in their ardent faith in the beneficent part the\r\nConfederacy was to play in future history. Like all other war poets\r\nhe suffered from the embittering effects of the conflict. His first\r\ninclination was to think more about his hopes for the South than\r\nabout his hatred of the North; yet even in \"The Cotton Boll\" and in\r\n\"Ethnogenesis\" he saw red at times, as any human partisan was bound to\r\ndo. The newly federated South was to send out from its whitened fields\r\nan idealized cotton crop that \"only bounds its blessings by mankind.\"\r\nThe labors of the planter were to strengthen the sinews of the world.\r\nYet into this finely altruistic mood came the acrid thought of the war\r\nwhich was in progress, and in a moment he was vilifying the \"Goth\" in\r\nthe same breath that he was resolving to be merciful. Timrod endured\r\nwithout flinching as an individual. As a confederate patriot he dreamed\r\n\r\n      Not only for the glories which the years\r\n      Shall bring us; not for lands from sea to sea,\r\n      And wealth, and power, and peace, though these shall be;\r\n      But for the distant peoples we shall bless,\r\n      And the hushed murmurs of a world's distress.\r\n\r\nBut when the war was over, in his \"Address to the Old Year\" (1866) he\r\nwas all for complete and speedy reconciliation.\r\n\r\n      A time of peaceful prayer,\r\n        Of law, love, labor, honest loss and gain--\r\n        These are the visions of the coming reign\r\n      Now floating to them on this wintry air.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in the slow approach toward this millennial conclusion\r\nTimrod was spared the brutal blunders of the Reconstruction period, for\r\nhe died within the next twelvemonth, serene in his hopes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPaul Hamilton Hayne (1830-1886), a man of moderate talents and of\r\nachievement that was greater in bulk than quality, was whole-heartedly\r\ndevoted to literature. With the founding of _Russell's_, while the\r\nbookseller supplied the capital and Simms the general stimulus, Hayne\r\nwas the obviously willing and capable young man to carry the editorial\r\nroutine. If the war had not cut short the life of the magazine within\r\nthree years, Hayne might have fulfilled a long and useful career in\r\nits guidance. Moreover, the kind of criticism to which his work would\r\nhave accustomed him might have refined his own verse and reduced its\r\nquantity as it did for Aldrich and Gilder. But a career like theirs was\r\ndenied him when _Russell's_ was discontinued, and he was forced into\r\nthe precarious existence of living by his pen without the assurance\r\nof any regular salary. Though this may be a sordid detail, it is not\r\na negligible one, for the lack of a certain income not only disturbs\r\nthe artist's mind but goads him to writing for monetary rather than\r\nartistic ends. This result is apparent in Hayne's work. He had to force\r\nhimself, and he wrote in consequence the only kind of poetry that\r\nindustry and good will can produce.\r\n\r\nMuch of it was for special occasions. He wrote on demand for\r\neverything, from art exhibits to cotton expositions, always\r\nconscientiously without any special lightness or felicity. He fell\r\ninto the conventional nineteenth-century habit of writing on romantic\r\nsubjects located in parts of the earth which he knew only from other\r\nmen's poetry. His best work, of course, sprang more directly from his\r\nexperience. Some of his war lyrics are stirring, though seldom up to\r\nTimrod's best. Some of his protests after the war are spirited and\r\nwholly justified by the stupid clumsiness of Northern control. \"South\r\nCarolina to the States of the North\" and \"The Stricken South to the\r\nNorth\" suggest in verse what Page's \"Red Rock\" and Tourgée's \"A Fool's\r\nErrand\" present through the detail of extended novels. Hayne's tributes\r\nto other poets, particularly to Longfellow and Whittier, are full of\r\ngenerous admiration, and his nature poems ring finely true. Most of all\r\nthe Southern pine fascinated him by its perennial grace and strength\r\nand its mysterious voice. A pine-tree anthology could be culled from\r\nhis verse.\r\n\r\nTo be the poet of a class or a district and no more than that\r\nis ordinarily not a notable achievement, but the fact that they\r\nrepresented an epoch as well as a section emphasizes the significance\r\nof Timrod and Hayne. They were products of freshly stimulating\r\nconditions in the South; before the war they began to sing for a\r\nneighborhood that had long been comparatively silent. And when the\r\nwar came on, and after its conclusion, they were not only its best\r\nsingers but they were remarkable in war literature for the fineness of\r\ntheir positive spirit and their relative freedom from abusive rancor.\r\nThey reaped in love and praise the reward that their impoverished\r\nconstituency could not pay them in money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSidney Lanier was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1842. He was therefore\r\ntwelve or thirteen years younger than Hayne or Timrod, and his\r\nproductive period was correspondingly later, namely, in the 70's. He\r\ncould trace his Lanier ancestry back to the court musicians of the\r\nStuarts, and beyond them to a conjectured past in France. His mother\r\nsang and played in the home, and his father, a courtly and refined\r\nlawyer, was a \"gentle reader\" of the old Southern school. Macon was\r\na town of extreme orthodoxy where \"the only burning issues were\r\nsprinkling versus immersion, freewill versus predestination,\" but where\r\nthe rigors of Calvinism were mollified by innocent merrymaking and the\r\namenities of Southern hospitality. From here Lanier went, in 1857, to\r\nOglethorpe University as a member of the sophomore class, graduating\r\nfrom the modest college with first honors in 1860. Though successful\r\nin scholarship, he had found his chief enjoyments in wide reading of\r\nromantic literature and in flute-playing. He was convinced that his\r\ntalents were in music, but his strong ethical bias led him to check\r\nthem because he could not satisfactorily answer the question, What is\r\nthe province of music in the economy of the world? On his appointment\r\nas tutor at Oglethorpe he decided to remain in college-teaching,\r\nrounding out his preparation by two years at Heidelberg. When the war\r\nbroke he seemed to be well started on the path trod by Longfellow and\r\nLowell.\r\n\r\nIn \"Tiger Lilies,\" his early romance, he described how the \"afflatus\r\nof war\" swept the South as it sweeps any land in the first hours of\r\ndecision. \"Its sound mingled with the serenity of the church organs\r\nand arose with the earnest words of preachers praying for guidance\r\nin the matter. It sighed in the half-breathed words of sweethearts,\r\nconditioning impatient lovers with war services. It thundered\r\nsplendidly in the impassioned words of orators to the people. It\r\nwhistled through the streets, it stole into the firesides, it clinked\r\nglasses in barrooms, it lifted the gray hairs of our wise men in\r\nconventions, it thrilled through the lectures in college halls, it\r\nrustled the thumbed book leaves of the schoolrooms.... It offered tests\r\nto all allegiances and loyalties,--of church, of state; of private\r\nloves, of public devotion; of personal consanguinity, of social ties.\"\r\nIn 1861 Lanier enlisted in the first Georgia regiment to leave for the\r\nfront. Four years later he returned with health permanently impaired by\r\nthe hardships of service and of a prison camp.\r\n\r\nEven though wrecked in health, he came out from the war saddened but\r\nnot embittered, and convinced as early as 1867 that the saving of the\r\nUnion had been worth the ordeal. His insistence that hatreds should\r\nbe buried was maintained in face of every influence to the contrary.\r\nThe countryside had been devastated and business brought to a stop.\r\nLibraries had been destroyed and colleges closed. As recuperation\r\nbegan the magnanimous influence of Lincoln waned, and the reign of\r\nthe \"carpetbaggers\" inflamed the worst elements in the South, drove\r\nsome of the better in despair to other parts of the country, and\r\nreduced the rest to bruised and heartsick indignation. Lanier could\r\nnot be unaffected by such conditions. He took refuge in grinding work:\r\nfirst in teaching and then in several years of law practice in the\r\nexamination of title deeds. \"Tiger Lilies\" was published in 1867 by\r\nHurd and Houghton in New York, and a number of poems were printed there\r\nin the _Round Table_ during 1867 and 1868. But depression and drudgery\r\ntended to silence him, and might have done so if the music in him had\r\nsuccumbed with the poetry and if the poetry had not been revived by\r\nthe stimulating friendships of two older men, Paul Hamilton Hayne and\r\nBayard Taylor.\r\n\r\nMusic gained a new hold on him during an enforced health trip to Texas\r\nin the winter of 1872-1873. He had reveled in the concerts he had heard\r\nin different visits to New York after the war, but in San Antonio he\r\nfell in with a group of musicians for whom he was a player as well\r\nas an auditor. Without any formal instruction in the flute he had\r\nachieved such a command of the instrument that it had become a second\r\nvoice for him. In the autumn of '73 he met and played for Hamerick,\r\nDirector of the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, and in\r\nDecember he went in triumph to his initial rehearsal as first flutist\r\nin the newly organized Peabody Symphony Orchestra. For the rest of\r\nhis life music was his most reliable means of support and a source of\r\npleasure that amounted to little less than dissipation. As a performer\r\nhe was in great demand for extra local engagements, from which he\r\nseemed to gain quite as much enjoyment as he gave--for he played in a\r\nkind of ecstasy; he \"felt in his performance the superiority of the\r\n_momentary inspiration_, to all the rules and shifts of mere technical\r\nscholarship.\" As an auditor, whether of his own music or that rendered\r\nby others, his appreciation was almost wholly sensuous, an experience\r\nof raptures, thrills, and swooning joys. \"Divine lamentations, far-off\r\nblowings of great winds, flutterings of tree and flower leaves and\r\nairs troubled with wing-beats of birds or spirits; floatings hither\r\nand thither of strange incenses and odors and essences; warm floods of\r\nsunlight, cool gleams of moonlight, faint enchantments of twilight;\r\ndelirious dances, noble marches, processional chants, hymns of joy and\r\ngrief: Ah, midst all these I lived last night, in the first chair next\r\nto Theodore Thomas' orchestra.\" From such a comment one is prepared for\r\nfrequent references to the more modern composers, few to Beethoven, and\r\nnone at all to Bach and Brahms; and one is helped to understand also\r\nthe mistakenly limited dictum--too often quoted--that \"Music is love in\r\nsearch of a word.\" Music was immensely important in Lanier's emotional\r\nlife; the kind that he most enjoyed, and the kind of enjoyment he\r\nderived from it, furnished the cue for an interpretation of much of his\r\npoetry--a cue which is the clearer when compared with what music meant\r\nto Browning.\r\n\r\nThe development of a Baltimore orchestra in 1873 was an expression\r\nof the reawakening of artistic life from Baltimore to the Gulf. By\r\n1870 the call was repeatedly sounded for a new literature and a new\r\ncriticism in the South. Short-lived magazines sprang up and were\r\nflooded with copy before their early deaths. Much was written that\r\nwas ostentatiously sectional in tone, but much by men like Hayne and\r\nCable and Page that approached the standard set by Joel Chandler\r\nHarris in his appeal for a literature which should be \"intensely local\r\nin feeling, but utterly unprejudiced and unpartisan as to opinions,\r\ntraditions, and sentiment. Whenever we have a genuine Southern\r\nliterature, it will be American and cosmopolitan as well.\" Equally in\r\nthe interest of the South was Hayne's demand for criticism which should\r\nput a quietus on the fatuous scribblers who had nothing to say and said\r\nit badly. \"No foreign ridicule,\" he wrote in the _Southern Magazine_ in\r\n1874, \"can stop this growing evil, until our own scholars and thinkers\r\nhave the manliness and honesty to discourage instead of applauding such\r\nmanifestations of artistic weakness and artistic platitudes as have\r\nhitherto been foisted on us by persons uncalled and unchosen of any of\r\nthe muses.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time a generously enterprising spirit led several of the\r\nleading Northern editors to accept and even solicit contributions from\r\nthe South. In 1873 _Scribner's Monthly_ projected and secured a widely\r\nadvertised series of articles on \"the great South.\" _Harper's_ had a\r\nseries of its own. The _Atlantic_, with Howells as editor, followed\r\nconservatively, and the _Independent_ opened its columns to the poetry\r\nof the men whom it had condemned in most aggressive terms a dozen years\r\nearlier. More important to Lanier than any of these was _Lippincott's_,\r\nin which \"Corn,\" \"The Symphony,\" and \"The Psalm of the West,\" with\r\ncertain shorter poems, were published in 1875, 1876, and 1877--poems by\r\nwhich his wide reputation was established.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement given him by Hayne in the dark days of the law, when\r\nhe had no time to write, was followed by a Northern friendship of even\r\ngreater value to him when the _Lippincott_ poems were brought to the\r\nkindly attention of Bayard Taylor. This busy and large-hearted man of\r\nletters seems to have been the literary friend of his whole generation.\r\nHe was on terms of easy acquaintance with the most renowned of his day.\r\nHe was a companion of publishers, editors, and journalists, and he\r\nshowed a most generous interest in the fortunes of promising younger\r\nmen. His literary status is summarized in his relation to the literary\r\nceremonies of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876. He\r\nwrote the Ode for the Fourth of July celebration after the honor had\r\nbeen declined by Bryant, Lowell, and Longfellow, and he had sufficient\r\ninfluence to gain for Lanier the distinction of writing the Cantata\r\nfor the opening ceremonies. The exchange of letters between the two in\r\nconnection with their efforts is unsurpassed as a record of detailed\r\nprocesses in poetic composition, criticism and rejoinder, and final\r\nrevision.\r\n\r\nLanier's conscious command of a poetic theory was a product of his\r\nhabits of study and led to his appointment by President Daniel\r\nCoit Gilman as lecturer in English literature at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity.[33] From youth Lanier had been an extensive reader of the\r\nearly English classics, and in Baltimore he eagerly used the resources\r\nof the Peabody Library, which was maintained especially for research\r\nstudents. He was keenly interested in stimulating general intelligence\r\nin literature among the adult public and also in promoting exact and\r\ntechnical study by qualified scholars. In 1878 he plunged once more\r\ninto study, planned lecture courses, projected a research program for\r\nhimself, and early in the next year received the Hopkins appointment.\r\nHe approached his work with the utmost zest and, as long as his\r\nstrength lasted, lectured effectively and worked on the critical texts\r\nand treatises which the scholarship of his time was just beginning to\r\nsupply. Now, however, when he had established working relations with\r\nthe orchestra and the university, he sank under the strain of all the\r\npreceding struggle, and in 1881 he died before reaching his fortieth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n  [33] This was the second time that President Gilman had placed a poet\r\n       in the position of teacher, for he had already done this with\r\n       Edward Rowland Sill at the University of California (see p. 397).\r\n\r\nLanier's abiding conviction put the poet on the same plane with the\r\nprophet and the seer. He was far from according with Poe's total\r\nsubordination of intellect and moral sense to the feeling for beauty.\r\nHe seldom or never wrote a didactic poem, but he usually composed over\r\na strong moralistic counterpoint. In \"Corn\" the poet\r\n\r\n            leads the vanward of his timid time\r\n      And sings up cowards with commanding rhyme.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Bee\" he will wage wars for the world. In \"The Marshes of Glynn\"\r\nhe is\r\n\r\n            the catholic man who hath mightily won\r\n      God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain.\r\n\r\nThe poet's judgments are, therefore, certain to surpass those of his\r\nage, certain to reap a harvest of derision and abuse, and certain to\r\napproach the right because they are made in the light of eternity\r\nrather than in the ephemeral shadow of any passing day.\r\n\r\nThe tolling of the bell of time which resounds throughout Lanier's\r\npoems does not deafen him to the harmonies or the discords of the\r\nmoment. With all his consciousness of literary tradition he was far\r\nmore alive to the present than many of his Southern contemporaries, who\r\nwere not so genuinely literary as imitatively bookish. \"Corn\" tells\r\nthe tale of the improvident cotton-grower who becomes \"A gamester's\r\ncatspaw and a banker's slave.\" \"The Symphony\" is an arraignment of the\r\nindustrial system.\r\n\r\n      If business is battle, name it so:\r\n      War-crimes less will shame it so,\r\n      And widows less will blame it so.\r\n\r\n\"Acknowledgment\" (first sonnet) and \"Remonstrance\" were written of the\r\ntroublous period which was wracked between doubts that merely disturbed\r\nand dogmas which were still advocated with all the subtleties of\r\npersecution that--in an enlightened age--will substitute ostracism for\r\nthe stake and social boycott for excommunication.\r\n\r\nIn the modest volume of his collected work--for his writing was mainly\r\ndone in his last eight years, and he was not a garrulous poet--there\r\nis a marked variety. \"The Revenge of Hamish\" is a clear reflection\r\nof his zest for heroic story. It is one of the notably successful\r\nattempts of his day to emulate the old ballad, and it is the better\r\nfor restoring the spirit of balladry without imitating the manner.\r\n\"How Love Looked for Hell,\" without being imitative of anyone, is\r\ndistinctly pre-Raphaelite in tone. Rossetti might have written it.\r\nIn \"The Stirrup-Cup\" there is an Elizabethan note, and \"Night and\r\nDay\" and the \"Marsh Song--at Sunset\" are literary lyrics for the\r\nreaders of \"Othello\" and \"The Tempest.\" These and their like give\r\ntoken of Lanier's versatility, just as the \"Song of the Chattahoochee\"\r\ndisplays his command of certain obvious devices in diction and rhythm;\r\nbut the poems most distinctive of Lanier and most generally quoted\r\nare the longer meditations already mentioned, and, in particular,\r\n\"The Symphony\" and \"The Marshes of Glynn.\" Of these the earlier is\r\nmuch quoted by social reformers for the vigor of its protests at\r\nthe exploitation of labor; by musicians, because of the sustained\r\nmetaphor--though it might better have been named \"The Orchestra\"; and\r\nby those who love a certain fulsomeness of sensuous appeal in verse.\r\nThis last trait gains friends also for \"The Marshes of Glynn,\" though\r\nits supreme passage, the last forty lines, is free from the decorative\r\nelaborations which in the earlier portion distract the reader from the\r\ncontent they adorn.\r\n\r\nIn the development of artistic power the formative period is the most\r\nopen to influence and the most likely to be formal and self-conscious.\r\nEarly and full maturity bring the nicest balance between the thing\r\nsaid and the manner of saying it; and a later period often is marked\r\nby overcompression or over-elaboration, a neglect of form in favor of\r\ncontent. Lanier, who died on the approach to middle life, had just\r\npublished \"The Science of English Verse\" and was studiously aware\r\nof poetic processes, from the ingenious conceits of the \"Paradise\r\nof Dainty Devices\" to the metrical experiments of Swinburne and his\r\ncontemporaries. In the compound of factors which were blending into the\r\nmatured Lanier there was still a good measure of Elizabethan ingenuity.\r\nHe felt a pleasant thrill in riding a metaphor down the page. He played\r\nrepeatedly, for example, with the concept of the passage of time. In\r\nthe second sonnet of \"Acknowledgment\" this age is a comma, and all\r\ntime a complex sentence (four lines); in \"Clover\" the course-of-things\r\nis a browsing ox (twenty-five lines); in \"The Symphony\" the leaves\r\nare dials on which time tells his hours (three lines); in the first\r\nof the \"Sonnets on Columbus\" prickly seconds and dull-blade minutes\r\nmark three hours of suspense (three lines); and in \"The Stirrup-Cup\"\r\ndeath is a cordial compounded by time from the reapings of poets long\r\ndead (twelve lines). These all are picturesquely suggestive, but they\r\nare rather imposed on the idea than derived from it. Other poets,\r\nto be sure, have erred in the same way and then perhaps redeemed\r\nthemselves. Lanier, however, said nothing so fundamentally true and\r\ncompact as Pope's \"Years following years _steal something_ every\r\nday,\" or Shakespeare's \"And that _old common arbitrator_, Time,\" or\r\nhis \"_whirligig_ of time.\" There is a similar reaching for effect in\r\nthe rhythmical quality of many well-known passages. The twelve-line\r\ndescription of the velvet flute-note in \"The Symphony\" is more deft\r\nand intricate than convincing. The figures stumble on each other's\r\nheels, and the alliterations, assonances, and three- and five-fold\r\nrimes are intrusively gratuitous. In like manner the opening lines of\r\n\"The Marshes of Glynn\" illustrate the over-luxuriance of Lanier. He\r\ndelighted in tropical exuberance; he rioted in his letters with less\r\nrestraint than in his verse, and in one written to his wife in 1874\r\nhe confessed parenthetically: \"In plain terms--sweet Heaven, how I do\r\nabhor these same plain terms--I have been playing 'Stradella.'\" When he\r\nwrote this Lanier was thirty-two. Before his death he had approached\r\nthe point of liking the plain term better and employing it oftener.\r\n\r\n\"The Marshes of Glynn\" is a personal utterance of Lanier in its\r\nform, in its sensuous opulence, in its social sympathies, and in its\r\nreligion; but in these latter respects it is emphatically the utterance\r\nalso of the period that produced Lanier. It was written in 1878, the\r\nyear of Bryant's death; it was written in the structural sequence\r\nof Bryant's \"Thanatopsis\"; and in its applications it indicates the\r\nchanges that had taken place in religious thought since Bryant's\r\nyouth. In the earlier poem the various language that Nature speaks is\r\nexpounded in general terms, before \"Thoughts of the last bitter hour\"\r\nlead to the monody on death and the resolve so to live that death shall\r\nhave no fears. The latter poem differentiates the tones of Nature,\r\nlingering first in the cloistral depths of the woods during the heat of\r\na June day. In the cool and quiet the poet's\r\n\r\n   ... heart is at ease from men, and the wearisome sound of the stroke\r\n   Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low,\r\n   And belief overmasters doubt.\r\n\r\nSo, toward sunset, he leaves the protected green colonnades and goes\r\nout unafraid to face the expanse of \"a world of marsh that borders a\r\nworld of sea.\" Here Nature, who has consoled him in the forest, fills\r\nhim with a great exhilaration.\r\n\r\n   Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea?\r\n   Somehow my soul seems suddenly free\r\n   From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,\r\n   By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn.\r\n\r\nFrom the marshes he learns a lesson of life rather than of death--the\r\nspiritual value of aspiration and the emancipating gift of a broad\r\nfaith. \"Thanatopsis\" ends with a nobly stated but restraining\r\nadmonition; \"The Marshes\" with a song of liberty:\r\n\r\n   I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies\r\n   In the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt the marsh and the\r\n       skies:\r\n   By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod\r\n   I will heartily lay me a-hold of the greatness of God.\r\n\r\nThis is written in the positive mood--and in the measure, too--of\r\nBrowning's \"Saul.\" Both poems record the throwing off of paralyzing\r\nrestraint and the substitution of hope for dread that resulted from the\r\nreligious struggles of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nLanier went far toward representing the South by the best of all\r\nmethods, which is to write as a citizen of the world and not as a\r\nsectionalist. He was not at the height of his maturity, and he wrote\r\nat times with the exuberance and at times with the self-consciousness\r\nthat he would in all likelihood have outgrown in the fullness of years.\r\nHe was an aggressive thinker. Only the indifference of his generation\r\nto poetry can account for the fact that he was not persecuted for the\r\ncourage of many utterances. And he was essentially the poet in artistry\r\nas well as in vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n     =Collections=\r\n\r\n       CLARKE, JENNIE T.

They\r\nare in fact more strikingly different from European writers than any\r\nother two in their outer and inner reaction against cultural tradition,\r\nthough it is an error to regard Americanism as an utterly new thing\r\ninstead of a compound of new and old elements. Whitman was born on Long\r\nIsland in 1819:\r\n\r\n  My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,\r\n  Born here of parents born here, from parents the same, and their\r\n        parents the same.\r\n\r\nThey were simple, natural, country people,--the mother, mild-mannered\r\nand competent, and the father, \"strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean,\r\nanger'd, unjust,\"--people with the kind of stalwart naïveté who would\r\nchristen three of their sons Andrew Jackson, George Washington, and\r\nThomas Jefferson. Walt was the second of nine children. From boyhood\r\nhe was quite able to take care of himself--amiable, slow-going, fond\r\nof chatting with the common folk of his own kind, and happy out of\r\ndoors, whether on the beach or among the Long Island hills. At twelve\r\nhe began to work for his living--in a lawyer's office and a doctor's,\r\nin printing shops and small newspaper offices, and in more than one\r\nschool. Newspaper work included writing as well as typesetting and\r\neverything between, and writing resulted in his sending accepted\r\ncontributions to such respected publications as the _Democratic Review_\r\nand George P. Morris's popular _Mirror_.\r\n\r\nFrom 1841 to 1850 he was more steadily using his pen. He wrote some\r\neighteen stories for the periodicals and, though he worked in defiance\r\nof the usual schedule, made his way in journalism to the point of\r\nbecoming editor of the _Brooklyn Daily Eagle_. In 1848 he moved in a\r\nwider orbit, going down to New Orleans through the Ohio valley to work\r\non the new _Crescent_, and coming back by way of the Mississippi and\r\nthe Great Lakes. In 1850 he was living with his family in Brooklyn.\r\nBy this time he had done a great deal of reading, starting with \"The\r\nArabian Nights\" and Scott, and moving on by his own choice through the\r\nclassics. Always, when he could, he read alone and out of doors; but\r\nseldom has man more completely fulfilled Emerson's behest to compensate\r\nfor solitude with society, for he was one of the great comrades of\r\nhistory. He found his society in places of his own selection--on the\r\nBroadway stages, in the Brooklyn ferryboats, and in the gallery at the\r\nItalian opera.\r\n\r\nHere is his own testimony: \"--the drivers--a strange, natural\r\nquick-eyed and wondrous race--(not only Rabelais and Cervantes would\r\nhave gloated upon them, but Homer and Shakspere would)--how well I\r\nremember them, and must here give a word about them.... They had\r\nimmense qualities, largely animal--eating, drinking, women--great\r\npersonal pride, in their way--perhaps a few slouches here and there,\r\nbut I should have trusted the general run of them, in their simple\r\ngood-will and honor, under all circumstances.\" And of the harbor:\r\n\"Almost daily, later ('50 to '60), I cross'd on the boats, often up\r\nin the pilot-houses where I could get a full sweep, absorbing shows,\r\naccompaniments, surroundings.\" There was a time when he affected fine\r\nclothes, but as he matured his dress and the dress of his ideas became\r\nstrikingly informal, more like that of his comrades.\r\n\r\nOf the five years before the \"Leaves of Grass\" appeared too little is\r\nknown. At thirty-one he was a natural Bohemian, independent enough not\r\neven to do the conventional Bohemian things like drinking and smoking,\r\nbut he had shown no marked promise of achieving anything more than\r\nhis own personal freedom. His writing and public speaking had been\r\ncommonplace, and his journalistic work respectably successful. Then\r\nin 1855 came the evidence of an immensely expansive development, a\r\ndevelopment so great and so unusual that it met the fate of its kind,\r\nreceiving from all but a very few neglect, derision, or contempt. John\r\nBurroughs tells of the staff of a leading daily paper in New York,\r\nassembled on Saturday afternoon to be paid off, greeting the passages\r\nthat were read aloud to them with \"peals upon peals of ironical\r\nlaughter.\" Whitman's family were indifferent. His brother George said\r\nhe \"didn't read it at all--didn't think it worth reading--fingered it\r\na little. Mother thought as I did ... Mother said that if 'Hiawatha'\r\nwas poetry, perhaps Walt's was.\" Obscure young men like Thoreau and\r\nBurroughs were moved to early admiration, but their opinion counted for\r\nnothing with the multitude. Emerson was the single man of influence to\r\n\"greet [Whitman] at the beginning of a great career.\" The larger public\r\npaid no attention to him; the smaller, artistic public did what they\r\nalways do to a defiantly independent artist. Whitman determined his own\r\nreception when he wrote,\r\n\r\n      Bearded, sunburnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,\r\n      To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe,\r\n      For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, in a new form and with added material but under the same\r\ntitle, there came a second edition that received more attention and\r\ncorrespondingly more abuse. His frank and often wanton treatment of\r\nsex gave pause to almost every reader, qualifying the approval of his\r\nstrongest champions. Emerson wrote to Carlyle: \"One book, last summer,\r\ncame out in New York, a nondescript monster, which yet had terrible\r\neyes and buffalo strength, and was indisputably American--which I\r\nthought to send you; but the book throve so badly with the few to whom\r\nI showed it, and wanted good morals so much, that I never did. Yet I\r\nbelieve now again I shall.\" In the meanwhile the ultra-respectable--of\r\nthe Jaffrey Pyncheon type--were eager to hound Whitman and his\r\npublishers out of society. Undoubtedly the advertising given by his\r\nenemies contributed no little to the circulation of the third and again\r\nenlarged edition of 1860. Of this between four and five thousand copies\r\nwere sold in due time.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, when his brother George was seriously wounded at\r\nFredericksburg, Whitman became a hospital nurse in Washington. With\r\nhis peculiar gifts of comradeship and his life-long acquaintance with\r\nthe common man, he was able to give thousands of sufferers the kind of\r\npersonal, affectionate attention that helped all, who were not doomed,\r\nto fight their way to recovery. From every side has come the testimony\r\nas to his unique relationship with them. One must be quoted:\r\n\r\n  Never shall I forget one night when I accompanied him on his rounds\r\n  through a hospital, filled with those wounded young Americans whose\r\n  heroism he has sung in deathless numbers. There were three rows of\r\n  cots, and each cot bore its man. When he appeared, in passing along,\r\n  there was a smile of affection and welcome on every face, however\r\n  wan, and his presence seemed to light up the place as it might be\r\n  lit by the presence of the Son of Love. From cot to cot they called\r\n  him, often in tremulous tones or in whispers; they embraced him,\r\n  they touched his hand, they gazed at him.... He did the things for\r\n  them which no nurse or doctor could do, and he seemed to leave a\r\n  benediction at every cot as he passed along. The lights had gleamed\r\n  for hours in the hospital that night before he left it, and as he\r\n  took his way towards the door, you could hear the voice of many a\r\n  stricken hero calling, \"Walt, Walt, Walt, come again! come again!\"\r\n\r\nThe fruits in poetry from these years of duress were in some ways the\r\nrichest of his lifetime. They were included in the edition of 1865\r\nunder the title \"Drum-Taps.\" Here were new poems \"of the body and of\r\nthe soul,\" telling of his vigils on the field and in the hospital,\r\nnot shrinking from details of horror and death; and here also were\r\npoems that dealt with the implications of the war and of nationalism\r\nmilitant. \"Drum-Taps\"--the title poem--and \"Beat! Beat! Drums!\" sound\r\nthe call to arms. \"The Song of the Banner at Daybreak\" contrasts the\r\npatriotism of the philistine with the patriotism of the idealist.\r\n\"Pioneers! O Pioneers!\" sings of America for the world, with its\r\nthrillingly prophetic fourth stanza,\r\n\r\n                  Have the elder races halted?\r\n  Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied, over there beyond\r\n        the seas?\r\n  We take up the task eternal, and the burden, and the lesson,\r\n                  Pioneers! O pioneers!\r\n\r\nAnd \"President Lincoln's Burial Hymn\" (\"When Lilacs last in the\r\nDoor-yard Bloom'd\") with \"O Captain! My Captain!\" are preëminent among\r\nthe multitude of songs in praise of Lincoln. Whitman wrote fairly in a\r\nletter: \"The book is therefore unprecedently sad (as these days are,\r\nare they not?), but it also has the blast of the trumpet and the drum\r\npounds and whirrs in it, and then an undertone of sweetest comradeship\r\nand human love threads its steady thread inside the chaos and is heard\r\nat every lull and interstice thereof. Truly also, it has clear notes of\r\nfaith and triumph.\"\r\n\r\nThere were other fateful fruits of his hospital service. It is the\r\nsalvation of the surgeon and the nurse that they adopt a professional\r\nattitude toward their tasks; they save individual lives in their\r\nstruggle to save human life. But it was the essence of Whitman's\r\nwork among the soldiers that he should pour out his compassion\r\nwithout stint. The drain of energy forced him more than once to leave\r\nWashington for rest at home, and assisting at operations resulted in\r\npoisonous contagions. He seemed to recover from these, only to give\r\nway in 1873 to a consequent attack of paralysis, and, though he had\r\nnineteen years to live, he was never quite free from the shadow of this\r\nmenace.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years, however, public respect increased as his\r\nstrength waned. Popularity this self-elected poet of the people never\r\ngained, but he became a poets' poet. A Whitman vogue developed among\r\nthe consciously literary, just as a Browning vogue did in the same\r\ndecades. It is rather a misfortune than otherwise for any art or artist\r\nto be made the subject of a fad, but the growth of Whitman's repute\r\nwas slow and was rooted in the regard of other artists. In the years\r\nnear 1870 essays and reviews in England and Germany showed how deeply\r\n\"Leaves of Grass\" impressed the small group of men who knew what the\r\nessentials of poetry were and were not afraid to acknowledge their\r\ngreat debt to this strange innovator. The timid culture of America at\r\nfirst shrank as usual from any native work which was un-European in\r\naspect, and lagged behind foreign indorsement of something freshly\r\nAmerican just as it did in the cases of Mark Twain and \"Joaquin\" Miller\r\n(see pp. 293 and 403). When it did begin to take Whitman seriously, the\r\nheartfelt admiration of Freiligrath in Germany and of William Michael\r\nRossetti and John Addington Symonds in England, the published charge\r\nthat America was neglecting a great poet, and the public offer of\r\nassistance from English friends combined to build up for \"the good gray\r\npoet\" a body of support to which the belated interest of the would-be\r\nintellectuals was a negligible addition. From 1881 to his death eleven\r\nyears later the income from his writings was sufficient to maintain him\r\nin \"decent poverty.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Myself and Mine\" Whitman delivered an admonition in spite of which\r\nhe has been discussed in a whole alcoveful of books and in innumerable\r\nlectures:\r\n\r\n      I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends, but\r\n          listen to my enemies--as I myself do;\r\n      I charge you, too, forever reject those who would expound me--for\r\n          I cannot expound myself;\r\n      I charge that there be no theory nor school founded out of me;\r\n      I charge you to leave all free, as I have left all free.\r\n\r\nThe comment and the controversy which have accumulated around his\r\npoems and himself center about two nodal points: one is the relatively\r\nobvious consideration of the objections to his poetic form, his subject\r\nmatter, and his conduct, and the other--far more complex and subtle--is\r\nthe statement and appraisal of his philosophy of life.\r\n\r\nPrejudice and ignorance have had altogether too much to say about\r\nWhitman's versification,--as they still have in connection with the\r\nfreer verse forms of the present day. Two or three simple facts should\r\nbe stated at the outset, by way of clearing the ground. His earliest\r\npoetry was written in conventional form; the form of \"Leaves of Grass\"\r\nwas the result neither of laziness nor of inability to deal with the\r\nestablished measures. Throughout his work there are recurrent passages\r\nin regular rimed meter. \"O Captain! My Captain!\" (1865), \"Ethiopia\r\nSaluting the Colors\" (1870), and the song of \"The Singer in the Prison\"\r\n(1870) are deliberate resorts to the old ways. More likely to escape\r\nthe attention are unlabeled bits scattered through poems in Whitman's\r\nusual manner. The opening of the \"Song of the Broad-Axe\" is in eight\r\nmeasures of trochaic tetrameter with a single rime--it sounds like\r\nEmerson's; and the first four lines of section 14 in \"Walt Whitman,\"\r\nor the \"Song of Myself,\" are iambic heptameters, a perfect stanza.\r\nFurthermore, he was not utterly alone in his generation. Similar\r\nexperiments by some of his contemporaries are almost forgotten, because\r\nthere was no vital relation between form and content; because there was\r\nnothing vital in them; but Whitman's rhythms survive because they are\r\nas alive as the wind in the tree tops.\r\n\r\nHe theorized out his art in detail and referred to his lines as\r\napparently \"lawless at first perusal, although on closer examination a\r\ncertain regularity appears, like the recurrence of lesser and larger\r\nwaves on the sea-shore, rolling in without intermission, and fitfully\r\nrising and falling.\" His feeling,--and this is the right word for a\r\nquestion of artistic form, which should not be determined primarily by\r\nthe intellect,--his feeling was that the idea which is being expressed\r\nshould govern from moment to moment the form into which it is cast,\r\nsince any pattern imposed on a long poem must handicap freedom. In many\r\na descriptive passage there is a succession of nice adjustments of\r\nword and rhythm to the thing being described. The flight of birds, the\r\nplay of waves, the swaying of branches, the thousandfold variations of\r\nmotion, are easy to reproduce and easy to perceive, but Whitman went\r\nfar beyond these to the innate suggestions of things and of ideas.\r\nAt the same time--not to be occupied in a search for variety which\r\nbecomes merely chaos--he adopted a succession of pattern rhythms,\r\ntaking a simple, free measure and modifying it in the reiterative\r\nform frequently used by Emerson and common to \"Hiawatha.\" There was\r\nsome acumen in Mrs. Whitman's comparison, for Longfellow's assumption\r\nof \"frequent repetitions\" was a reverting to the parallelism that\r\nprevails in most folk poetry, the same parallelism which is the warp\r\nof Whitman's patterns. Whitman was just as conscious in his choice\r\nof diction as in his selection of measures. Poetry, he agreed with\r\nWordsworth, was choked with outworn phrases; the language of the people\r\nshould be the source of a poetic tongue. From this he could evolve a\r\n\"perfectly clear, plate-glassy style.\"\r\n\r\nIn execution he was, of course, uneven. He wrote scores upon scores of\r\npassages that were full of splendor, of majesty, of rugged strength,\r\nof tender loveliness. In general it is true that the lines which\r\ndeal with definite aspects of natural and physical beauty are most\r\neffective--lines of which \"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking\" are\r\nthe purest type; but many of the poems and sections in which concrete\r\nimagery is summoned to the explication of a general idea are often\r\nfinely successful--as in his stanzas on the poet, or on himself, \"the\r\ndivine average,\" for example:\r\n\r\n      My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;\r\n      I laugh at what you call dissolution;\r\n      And I know the amplitude of time.\r\n\r\nTo the hostile critic he offered an abundance of lines for unfriendly\r\nquotation, as almost every prolific poet has done. Furthermore, he\r\nopened to attack all the series of \"catalogue,\" or \"inventory,\"\r\npassages, in which he abandoned the artistic habit of selective\r\nsuggestion and overwhelmed the reader with an avalanche of detail.\r\nIt is not necessary to defend these vagaries or excesses; they are\r\nobvious eccentricities in Whitman's workmanship, as are also the wanton\r\nbarbarisms of wording into which he occasionally lapsed. There are good\r\nEnglish equivalents for _omnes_ and _allons_ and _dolce_ and _résumé_,\r\nand better ones than _promulge_, _philosoph_, and _imperturbe_.\r\n\r\nThe most violent objections launched at Whitman were based on his\r\nunprecedented frankness in matters of sex. It was the habit of the\r\nVictorian period, whether in England or in America, to shroud in an\r\nunwholesome silence the impulse to beget life and the facts surrounding\r\nit as if they were shameful matters. In consequence a central element\r\nin social and individual experience tended to become a subject of\r\nmorbid curiosity to young people and one of furtive self-indulgence to\r\nadults. This bred vicious ignorance, distorted half-knowledge, and,\r\namong other things, hysterical protestations at any open violation of\r\nthe code in action or in speech. People seemed to feel that they were\r\nvindicating their own probity by the voluminousness of their invective.\r\nSo Whitman was made a scapegoat, just as Byron was at an earlier date;\r\nand the merits of the controversies are obscured by the fact that\r\nhowever much in error the poets may have been, their accusers were\r\nhardly less in the wrong. Out of the babel of discussion one clearest\r\nnote emerged in the form of a letter from an Englishwoman to W. M.\r\nRossetti, who had lent her \"Leaves of Grass\":\r\n\r\n  I rejoice to have read these poems; and if I or any true woman\r\n  feel that, certainly _men_ may hold their peace about them. You\r\n  will understand that I still think that instinct of silence I\r\n  spoke of a right and beautiful thing; and that it is only lovers\r\n  and poets (perhaps only lovers and _this_ poet) who may say what\r\n  they will--the lover to his own, the poet to all because all are\r\n  in a sense his own. Shame is like a very flexible veil that takes\r\n  faithfully the shape of what it covers--lovely when it hides a lovely\r\n  thing, ugly when it hides an ugly one. There is not any fear that the\r\n  freedom of such impassioned words will destroy the sweet shame, the\r\n  happy silence, that enfold and brood over the secrets of love in a\r\n  woman's heart.\r\n\r\nThis single judgment naturally cannot serve as a universal ultimatum,\r\nbut it should serve as a warning for those who jump to the conclusion\r\nthat only one mood is possible for the writer or reader of such\r\npassages. Those who are disturbed by them should be willing not to read\r\nthe few score lines that are responsible for all the turmoil.\r\n\r\nThe only other charge against Whitman worth mentioning--the complaint\r\nat his \"colossal egotism\"--is a subject more for interpretation than\r\nfor defense. Properly understood, it leads far toward an understanding\r\nof the whole man. In the first place, if all his \"I's\" should be taken\r\nliterally they would amount to no more than an unusual frankness of\r\nartistic expression. Every creative artist is of necessity an egotist.\r\nHe is bound to believe in the special significance of what he is\r\nprivileged to utter in words or tones or lines and colors. The whole\r\nanthology of poems on the poet and his work is a catalogue of supreme\r\negotisms, even though most of them are written in the third person\r\nrather than the first. Whitman cast aside the regular locution without\r\napology. But, as a further caution to the supersensitive, his \"I's\" do\r\nnot always mean the same thing. Sometimes they are explicitly personal,\r\nas in,\r\n\r\n      I, now, thirty-six years old, in perfect health, begin,\r\n      Hoping to cease not till death.\r\n\r\nSometimes they stand just as explicitly for \"the average man.\" This\r\nhe explained in the preface to the 1876 edition: \"I meant 'Leaves of\r\nGrass,' as published, to be the poem of average Identity (of _yours_,\r\nwhoever you are, now reading these lines).... To sing the Song of that\r\nlaw of average Identity, and of Yourself, consistently with the divine\r\nlaw of the universal, is a main purpose of these 'Leaves.'\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the egotistic \"I\" is often a token of the religious mysticism\r\nat the back of his faith. Without an understanding of this factor in\r\nWhitman he cannot be known. \"Place yourself,\" said William James in\r\nhis lecture on Bergson, \"at the center of a man's philosophic vision\r\nand you understand at once all the different things it makes him\r\nwrite or say. But keep outside, use your post-mortem method, try to\r\nbuild the philosophy up out of the single phrases, taking first one\r\nand then another, and seeking to make them fit, and of course you\r\nfail. You crawl over the thing like a myopic ant over a building,\r\ntumbling into every microscopic crack or fissure, finding nothing\r\nbut inconsistencies, and never suspecting that a centre exists.\" It\r\nis James again who gives the exact cue to Whitman's mysticism, this\r\ntime in a chapter of \"Varieties of Religious Experience.\" It is the\r\nexperience of the mystic, he explains, to arrive in inspired moments\r\nat a height from which all truth seems to be divinely revealed. This\r\nrevelation is not a flashlight perception of some single aspect of\r\nlife, but a sense of the entire scheme of creation and a conviction\r\nthat the truth has been imparted direct from God. It is clear, like the\r\nview from a mountain top, but, like such a view, it is incapable of\r\nadequate expression in words,--\"an intuition,\" and now the words are\r\nWhitman's, \"of the absolute balance, in time and space, of the whole\r\nof this multifarious, mad chaos of fraud, frivolity, hoggishness--this\r\nrevel of fools, and incredible make-believe and general unsettledness,\r\nwe call _the world_; a soul-sight of that divine clue and unseen thread\r\nwhich holds the whole congeries of things, all history and time,\r\nand all events, however trivial, however momentous, like a leashed\r\ndog in the hand of the hunter.\" It was the fashion of speech of the\r\nHebrew prophets, when thus inspired, to preface their declarations\r\nwith \"Thus saith the Lord\"; Whitman, with his simpler, \"I say\" or \"I\r\ntell you,\" regarded himself no less as mouthpiece of the Most High.\r\nThe vision made him certain of an underlying unity in all life and of\r\nthe coming supremacy of a law of love; it made him equally certain of\r\nthe mistakenness of human conditions and unqualifiedly direct in his\r\nuttered verdicts.\r\n\r\nThis sense of the wholeness of life--a transcendental doctrine--made\r\nall the parts deeply significant to him who could perceive their\r\nmeaning. The same mystic consciousness is beneath all these passages,\r\nand all the others like them:\r\n\r\n  I celebrate myself,\r\n  And what I assume you shall assume,\r\n  For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night;\r\n  _Ya-honk!_ he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;\r\n  (The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close;\r\n  I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.)\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I believe a leaf of grass no less than the journey-work of the stars,\r\n  And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg\r\n        of the wren,\r\n  And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,\r\n  And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\r\n  And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\r\n  And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,\r\n  And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels,\r\n  And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer's\r\n        girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking short-cake.\r\n\r\nIt explains, too, the otherwise bewildering excesses of the \"inventory\"\r\npassages, which, for all their apparent unrelatedness, are always\r\nbrought up with a unifying, inclusive turn. In the universe, then,--and\r\nWhitman thought of the word in its literal sense of a great and single\r\ndesign,--man was the supreme fact to whom all its objects \"continually\r\nconverge\"; as man was God-created, Whitman was no respecter of\r\npersons, but a lover of the common folk, in whom the destiny of\r\nhuman-kind resided more than in presidents or kings. And since he\r\nconsidered the race in the light of ages upon ages, the generating of\r\nlife seemed to him a matter of holiest import.\r\n\r\nFor the carrying out of such a design the only fit vehicle is the\r\npurest sort of democracy; all other working bases of human association\r\nare only temporary obstacles to the course of things; and as Whitman\r\nsaw the nearest approach to the right social order in his own country,\r\nhe was an American by conviction as well as by the accident of place.\r\nGovernments, he felt, were necessary conveniences, and so-called rulers\r\nwere servants of the public from whom their powers were derived. The\r\ngreatest driving power in life was public opinion, and the greatest\r\npotential molder of public opinion was the bard, seer, or poet. This\r\npoet was to be not a reformer but a preacher of a new gospel; he was,\r\nin fact, to be infinitely patient in face of \"meanness and agony\r\nwithout end\" while he invoked the principles which would one day put\r\nthem to rout.\r\n\r\n  I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions;\r\n  But really I am neither for nor against institutions;\r\n  (What indeed have I in common with them?--Or what with the\r\n        destruction of them?)\r\n  Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and in every city of These\r\n        States, inland and seaboard,\r\n  And in the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large,\r\n        that dents the water,\r\n  Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any argument,\r\n  The institution of the dear love of comrades.\r\n\r\nTo the bard he attributed knowledge of science and history,--the\r\nlearning of the broadly educated man,--but, beyond that, wisdom:\r\n\r\n  He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither more\r\n        nor less....\r\n  He is no arguer, he is judgment--(Nature accepts him absolutely;)\r\n  He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a\r\n        helpless thing:\r\n  As he sees farthest, he has the most faith.\r\n\r\nHe is no writer of \"poems distilled from foreign poems\"; he is the\r\npropounder of\r\n\r\n                      the idea of free and perfect individuals,\r\n  For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,\r\n  The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.\r\n\r\nIn America, whose \"veins are filled with poetical stuff,\" Whitman was\r\ncertain not only of the need for poets but of their ultimate power; for\r\n_in_ America, the cradle of the race, and _through_ the bards God's\r\nwill was to be done.\r\n\r\nWhitman arrived at the acme of self-reliance. With the mystic's sense\r\nof revealed truth at hand, and a devout conviction that it was the\r\npoet's duty--his duty--to show men a new heaven and a new earth, he\r\nwent on his way with perfect faith. Emerson wrote of self-reliance in\r\ngeneral, \"Adhere to your act, and congratulate yourself if you have\r\ndone something strange and extravagant, and broken the monotony of a\r\ndecorous age.\" Yet he remonstrated with Whitman, and in the attempt\r\nto modify his extravagance used arguments which were unanswerable.\r\nNevertheless, said the younger poet, \"I felt down in my soul the clear\r\nand unmistakable conviction to disobey all, and pursue my own way\";\r\nin doing which he bettered Emerson's instructions by disregarding\r\nhis advice. Hostile or brutal criticism left him quite unruffled. It\r\nreënforced him in his conclusions and cheered him with the thought\r\nthat they were receiving serious attention. After Swinburne's fiercest\r\nattack says Burroughs: \"I could not discover either in word or look\r\nthat he was disturbed a particle by it. He spoke as kindly of Swinburne\r\nas ever. If he was pained at all, it was on Swinburne's account and not\r\non his own. It was a sad spectacle to see a man retreat upon himself as\r\nSwinburne had done.\"\r\n\r\nHis daily preoccupation with \"superior beings and eternal interests\"\r\ngave him some of the elevations and some of the contempts of the\r\nPuritan fathers. It leads far to think of Whitman as a Puritan stripped\r\nof his dogma. It accounts for his daily absorption in things of\r\nreligion, for his democratic zeal, his disregard for the adornments\r\nof life, even for his subordination of the sentiment of love to the\r\nperpetuation of the race. In these respects he dwelt on the broad and\r\npermanent factors in human life, regarding the finite and personal\r\nonly as he saw them in the midst of all time and space. And this\r\nleads to the man in his relation to science, with which Puritan dogma\r\nwas at odds. Whitman was not in the usual sense a \"nature poet.\" The\r\nbeauties of nature exerted little appeal on him. He had nothing to\r\nsay in detached observations on the primrose, or the mountain tops,\r\nor the sunset. But nature was, next to his own soul, the source of\r\ndeepest truth to him, a truth which science in his own day was making\r\nsplendidly clear. The dependence of biological science on the material\r\nuniverse did not shake his faith in immortality. He simply took what\r\nknowledge science could contribute and understood it in the light of\r\nhis faith, which transcended any science. Among modern poets he was one\r\nof the earliest to chant the pæan of creative evolution.\r\n\r\n  Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\r\n  Afar down I see the huge first Nothing--I know I was even there,\r\n  I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,\r\n  And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\r\n\r\n  Before I was born out of my mother, generations guided me,\r\n  My embryo has never been torpid--nothing could overlay it.\r\n  For it the nebula cohered to an orb,\r\n  The long, slow strata piled to rest it in,\r\n  Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,\r\n  Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths, and deposited it\r\n        with care.\r\n  All forces have been steadily employed to complete and delight me,\r\n  Now I stand on this spot with my Soul.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, as all critics agree, to compass Whitman in a book\r\nor essay or compress him into a summary. He was an immensely expansive\r\npersonality whose writings are as broad as life itself. It is almost\r\nequally impossible for one who has really read over and through and\r\nunder his poems to speak of him in measured terms. The world is coming\r\nround to Whitman much faster than he expected. Every great step in\r\nhuman progress is a step in the direction he was pointing. His larger\r\nfaith, whether so recognized or not, is yearly the faith of more and\r\nmore thinking people. And in an immediate way his influence on the\r\ngeneration of living poets is incomparably great.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Author_=\r\n\r\n  WALT WHITMAN.

The earliest\r\nwriters came from the East and were only temporary sojourners in the\r\nnew country, Bret Harte and Mark Twain corresponding in different\r\ndegrees to colonists like John Smith and Nathaniel Ward. A more\r\npermanent allegiance developed in a second group who lived out their\r\nlives in the land of their adoption, such, for example, as Joaquin\r\nMiller and Increase Mather. And the final stage is fulfilled by those\r\nwhose whole lives belonged to the maturing frontier, like most of the\r\nsecond generation. The parallel exists too in the fact that the early\r\nauthors wrote usually with one eye on the older community, eager for\r\napproval and half resentful of criticism--an attitude of West toward\r\nEast which still survives in the timider element along the chain from\r\nLondon to New York to Chicago to San Francisco to Honolulu. The obvious\r\ncontrasts between the motives for settlement, the character of the\r\nsettlers, and the nature of their writings only serve to emphasize the\r\nunderlying similarities. Manners change, but human nature changes so\r\nmuch more slowly that it seems almost a constant.\r\n\r\nBret Harte (1839-1902) is the outstanding writer who lived for a\r\nwhile in the far West, turned it to literary account, failed in any\r\ndeep sense either to sympathize with its spirit or to represent it,\r\nand left it permanently and with apparent relief. He was an Eastern\r\ntown-bred boy of cultured parentage who aspired to become a poet. At\r\neighteen he went to California where, before he was twenty-one, he\r\nsaw life as tutor, express messenger, typesetter, teacher, and drug\r\nclerk. During half of the next fourteen years in San Francisco he\r\nwas secretary of the California mint, and during all of them he was\r\nprimarily interested in authorship. He wrote for periodicals East and\r\nWest and had a manuscript accepted by the _Atlantic_ as early as 1863.\r\nWith the founding of the _Overland Monthly_ in 1868 he became editor,\r\nand with the publication of \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" in the second\r\nnumber he jumped into fabulous popularity. In 1871 he went to New York,\r\nand in 1878 he went abroad, where he lived till his death in complete\r\nestrangement from all his old associates. These latter facts deserve\r\nmention only as they stress the lightness of his contact with the\r\nWest. He found fresh material there which he used with great narrative\r\nadroitness, contributing definitely to the progress of short-story\r\ntechnique. But his tales are deftly melodramatic, built on a sort of\r\nparadox formula, and greatly indebted in detail and mannerisms to\r\nthe example of Charles Dickens. Harte was beyond any question a good\r\ncraftsman; his wares would still find a ready magazine market, for they\r\nwould be modern in execution, but there is no soul in what he wrote.\r\nHe was a reporter with a gift for rapid-moving, close-knit narrative.\r\nHe was greatly interested in facts, but very little concerned with the\r\ntruth. He wrote some clever stories, but he seems like a trinket shop\r\nat the foot of Pike's Peak as Mark Twain looms above him.\r\n\r\nThe life of Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835-1910) probably\r\ntouches American life at more points than that of any other author.\r\nThe first half has been very definitely written into his books, and\r\nthe whole has been told with his help in one of the best of American\r\nbiographies.[34] It involves indirectly his Virginia parentage and\r\nthe pioneer experiences of his father and mother in the Tennessee\r\nmountains; his own residence in the Mississippi valley and on both\r\nseacoasts; his activities as printer, river-pilot, journalist,\r\nlecturer, and publisher; his friendships with all sorts and conditions\r\nof men from California miners to the crowned heads of Europe; the\r\njoys and sorrows of a beautiful family life; the making and losing of\r\nseveral fortunes; and an old age crowded with honors and popularity,\r\nyet overshadowed by a tragic cloud of doubts and griefs.\r\n\r\n  [34] \"Mark Twain, a Biography,\" by Albert Bigelow Paine. 3 vols. 1912.\r\n\r\nHis parents, who had been dissatisfied with their attempted settlement\r\nin a Tennessee mountain town, left it in 1835 with four children for\r\nFlorida, Missouri, allured to the move by the optimism of a relative,\r\nas it worked on their own pioneer restlessness. The conditions they\r\nleft are vividly described in the first eleven chapters of \"The Gilded\r\nAge.\" In a little town of twenty-one dwellings the boy was born in\r\nthe autumn of 1835. When he was four years old the family moved to\r\nHannibal, a river town. Sam Clemens was an irresponsible, dreamy,\r\nrather fragile child, a problem to parents and teachers and given to\r\nassociating with the boys presented in \"Tom Sawyer,\" the most notable\r\nof whom was Tom Blankenship, the original of \"Huckleberry Finn.\" His\r\nfather, consistently unsuccessful, was made justice of the peace and\r\nfinally was elected clerk of the circuit court, only to die in 1847\r\nfrom exposure in the campaign. For the next ten years young Clemens\r\nwas engaged in the printing business, first under his brother Orion\r\non a Hannibal journal (see \"My First Literary Venture,\" in \"Sketches,\r\nNew and Old,\" pp. 110-114); then during fifteen months in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Washington, and next in Keokuk, Illinois, and\r\nCincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\nFinally, in April, 1857, he began to \"learn the river\" from Horace\r\nBixby, pilot of the _Paul Jones_. His experience on the river, the\r\nbasis for \"Life on the Mississippi,\" was early marked by the tragic\r\ndestruction of the _Pennsylvania_, on which his younger brother, Henry,\r\nsuffered a fearful death, the first of the personal sorrows which were\r\ndeeply scored into his life. His career as pilot was ended by the\r\nclosing of river traffic in the spring of 1861, but it gave him, with\r\nmany other bequests, his pen name, derived from one of the calls used\r\nin sounding the depth of the ever-shifting channel. Piloting during\r\nwar times did not appeal to him. \"I am not very anxious to get up into\r\na glass perch and be shot at by either side. I'll go home and reflect\r\non the matter.\" And after reflection he chose the better part of valor\r\nand stayed on land. In the next three months there followed his amusing\r\nadventures recorded in \"The Private History of a Campaign that Failed\"\r\n(see \"The American Claimant,\" pp. 243-265); and in July, 1861, he went\r\nwith his brother Orion to serve with J. W. Nye, territorial governor\r\nof Nevada. The life of the next months went into \"Roughing It,\" first\r\nat Carson City, then at Humboldt, until, in August, 1862, he began his\r\njournalistic work in California on _The Virginia City Enterprise_. At\r\ntwenty-five he had secured his first view of the country from coast\r\nto coast and all down the central artery, he had been schooled in the\r\nexacting discipline of the printer's trade (see pp. 47, 48) and in the\r\nstill more rigorous responsibilities of river piloting, and he had\r\nbegun to write for a living. Two more steps remained in the growth of\r\nhis acquaintance with the external world, and these followed after\r\nfive years of shifting fortunes on California newspapers. The first\r\nwas his trip to Honolulu as correspondent for the _Sacramento Union_,\r\non the new steamer _Ajax_, and the second, in 1867, was his trip to\r\nthe Holy Land on the steamship _Quaker City_ for the tour which was to\r\nbe immortalized in \"Innocents Abroad,\" first as a series of newspaper\r\nletters and then in book form.\r\n\r\nWith the publication of \"The Innocents\" in the summer of 1869 Mark\r\nTwain came to the halfway point. Out of his wide experience he had\r\ndeveloped the habits of an observer and he had learned how to write.\r\nHe had earned a reputation as a newspaper man, and he had published\r\nhis most famous short story, \"The Jumping Frog,\" using his talent\r\nin spinning a yarn[35] after his own fashion. His lecturing had\r\nmet with unqualified success; the new book was selling beyond all\r\nexpectation--67,000 copies in the first year; and he was happily\r\nmarried to Olivia Langdon, his balance wheel, his severest critic, and\r\nthe friend of all his closest friends.\r\n\r\n  [35] See his essay \"How to Tell a Story\" in \"The Man that Corrupted\r\n       Hadleyburg,\" pp. 225-230.\r\n\r\nThe story of the rest of his life is a record of varied and spectacular\r\nfortunes. His home from 1871 to 1891 was in Hartford, Connecticut,\r\nwhere he was a neighbor of Charles Dudley Warner and an intimate of\r\nthe Reverend Joseph Twitchell (the original of Harris in \"A Tramp\r\nAbroad\"), and where William Dean Howells, his friend of over forty\r\nyears, often visited him. There was a kind of lavishness in everything\r\nhe did. He built a mansion, made money with ease, spent it profusely,\r\nand invested it with the care-free optimism of Colonel Sellers himself.\r\nNew inventions fascinated him and made him an easy victim for the\r\nfluent promoter, so that what was left from his ventures with the\r\n_Buffalo Express_ and the Webster Publishing Company went into other\r\nenterprises, of which the Paige typesetting machine was the most\r\ndisastrous for this ex-printer. After his failure for a large amount,\r\na later friend, Henry H. Rogers, took his affairs in hand and by good\r\nmanagement enabled Mark Twain to meet all debts and enjoy a very\r\nhandsome income during his later years.\r\n\r\nThe ups and downs of business distracted him but did not baffle him. He\r\ntraveled extensively, living abroad during most of the decade between\r\n1891 and 1901. He made cordial friends wherever he went, but he was\r\nnot weaned by them away from the old cronies of the Mississippi Valley\r\nand the Pacific coast. He accepted honors from Yale twice and from the\r\nUniversity of Missouri, and in 1907 was the subject of a four-weeks'\r\novation from all England when he went over to receive the degree\r\nof Doctor of Letters from Oxford. His opinion was sought on public\r\nquestions and he was importuned for speeches on every sort of occasion;\r\nbut his last years were shadowed by a succession of bereavements. In\r\n1903 Mrs. Clemens died. Two children died in childhood, a third under\r\ntragic circumstances in 1909, and the surviving daughter was married\r\nand far away most of the time. His chief personal solace was found in\r\nhis friendships with several schoolgirls.\r\n\r\n  During those years after my wife's death I was washing about on a\r\n  forlorn sea of banquets and speech-making in high and holy causes,\r\n  and these things furnished me intellectual cheer and entertainment;\r\n  but they got at my heart for an evening only, then left it dry\r\n  and dusty. I had reached the grandfather stage of life without\r\n  grandchildren, so I began to adopt some.\r\n\r\nHe died of angina pectoris in 1910.\r\n\r\nMark Twain's reputation was built on his humor. He came to his maturity\r\nin a fruitful decade just after the Civil War, when a crop of newspaper\r\nmen were coming out with a recklessly fresh, informal jocularity which\r\nwas related to the old American humor, but a great departure from\r\nit. They were all unconscious of making any contribution to American\r\nliterature. They never could have written books which would have won\r\nthe attention of Irving's readers and the perusers of the old Annuals\r\nand the admirers of the Knickerbocker courtliness. They wrote for the\r\nworld of Horace Greeley and the elder James Gordon Bennett, caring\r\nnothing for beauty of style or for any kind of literary tradition. They\r\nwrote under odd pen names like \"John Phoenix,\" who preceded them by\r\nten years--\"Petroleum V. Nasby,\" \"Artemus Ward,\" \"Orpheus C. Kerr,\"\r\n\"Max Adler,\" and \"M. Quad\" serving as fancy dress for Locke, Browne,\r\nNewell, Clark, and Lewis. They drew their material from the common\r\npeople, as Lincoln had done with all his anecdotes, putting it in the\r\nidiom of the common people and frequently distorting it into illiterate\r\nspelling, as Lowell had done in \"The Biglow Papers.\" This disturbed\r\nand shocked the lovers of a refined literature--men like Stedman, for\r\nexample, who wrote to Bayard Taylor, \"The whole country, owing to\r\n_contagion_ of our American newspaper 'exchange' system, is flooded,\r\ndeluged, swamped, beneath a muddy tide of slang, vulgarity, inartistic\r\n[bathos], impertinence, and buffoonery that is not wit.\" But it was an\r\nirresistible tide that threw up on its waves something more than froth\r\nor flotsam, in the shape of a few real treasures from the deep--and the\r\nrarest was Mark Twain.\r\n\r\nHad there been no such journalistic tide this original genius would\r\nstill have gone on his original way. What these other men did was much\r\nmore to put the public into a humor for Mark Twain than to lead Mark\r\nTwain in his approach to the public. He started as the others did,\r\nallowing an undercurrent of seriousness to appear now and then in the\r\nflow of his extravagance. His platform experience taught him by the\r\nimmediate response of the audience what were the most effective methods.\r\n\r\n      All Tully's rules and all Quintilian's too,\r\n      He by the light of listening faces knew.\r\n      And his rapt audience, all unconscious, lent\r\n      Their own roused force to make him eloquent.[36]\r\n\r\nHe was quite deliberate in the employment of them. His essay on \"How\r\nto Tell a Story\" is an evidence of what he knew about structure, and\r\nhis letter to the young London editorial assistant (see Paine's \"Mark\r\nTwain\" pp. 1091-1093) is only the best of many passages which show his\r\nscrupulous regard for diction. He did not indulge in the usual vagaries\r\nof spelling; he had, to paraphrase his own words, \"a singularly fine\r\nand aristocratic respect for homely and unpretending English\"; and he\r\ntreated punctuation as a \"delicate art\" for which he had the highest\r\nrespect. People who carelessly think of Mark Twain as a kind of\r\nliterary swashbuckler can disabuse themselves by an attentive reading\r\nof any few pages.\r\n\r\n  [36] James Russell Lowell, \"Ode on Agassiz.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they are doing it, they can discover in addition to the points\r\njust mentioned that he was essentially clean-minded. Vulgar he\r\nwas, to be sure, at times, in the sense of not indulging always\r\nin drawing-room talk or displaying drawing-room manners, as, for\r\ninstance, in his repeated references to spitting,--to use the homely\r\nand unpretending word,--but he never partook of the nature of his rough\r\nand ready human subjects to quite the extent that Franklin or Lincoln\r\ndid. His pages are utterly free from filth. He drew a line, no doubt\r\nassisted by Mrs. Clemens, between what he wrote for the public and his\r\nprivate speech and correspondence. \"He had,\" Mr. Howells wrote, \"the\r\nSouthwestern, the Lincolnian, the Elizabethan breadth of parlance,\r\nwhich I suppose one ought not to call coarse, without calling one's\r\nself prudish; and I was always hiding away in discreet holes and\r\ncorners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on\r\nrank suggestion; I could not quite bear to burn them, and I could not,\r\nafter the first reading, quite bear to look at them. I shall best give\r\nmy feeling on this point by saying that in it he was Shakespearian, or\r\nif his ghost will not suffer me the word, then he was Baconian.\"\r\n\r\nHis humor relied on his never-failing and often extravagant use of the\r\nincongruous and the irrelevant. Often this came out in his similes and\r\nmetaphors. \"A jay hasn't got any more principles than a Congressman.\"\r\n\"His lectures on Mont Blanc ... made people as anxious to see it as if\r\nit owed them money.\" It emerged in his impertinent personalities, as\r\nin the instance of his first meeting with Grant, when he said after a\r\nmoment of awkwardness: \"General, I seem to be a little embarrassed. Are\r\nyou?\" or as in the case of his reply to a query as to why he always\r\ncarried a cotton umbrella in London, that it was the only kind he could\r\nbe sure would not be stolen there. It appeared too in his sober misuse\r\nof historical facts with which he and his readers or auditors were well\r\nacquainted. And it was developed most elaborately in \"hoax\" passages\r\nwhere, in his violation of both fact and reason, the canny author\r\nlooked like the innocent flower but was the serpent under it.\r\n\r\nA particular charm attached to his work because it was so apparently\r\nuncalculated and spontaneous. What he wrote seemed to be for his own\r\ndelectation, and what he spoke to be the casual improvisation of the\r\nmoment. At times, of course, he did improvise--with all the art of a\r\nmusician whose mastery of technique is no less the result of great\r\nlabor because he has it completely in hand; but often the utterance\r\nwhich his hearers took for an extempore speech had been composed to\r\nthe last syllable and then delivered with an art that concealed its\r\nown artistry. No doubt for the multitudes who bought up the editions\r\nof \"Innocents Abroad\" the salient feature of Mark Twain's writing was\r\nits jovial extravagance. The first feeling of the public was that he\r\nhad out-Phoenixed \"Phoenix\" and beaten \"Petroleum Nasby\" at his\r\nown game. Beyond question he literally \"enjoyed himself\" when he was\r\ngiving hilarious enjoyment to others; the free play of his antic fancy\r\nwas a kind of self-indulgence. The best evidence is offered in \"Joan of\r\nArc.\" The story is approached, pursued, and concluded in a spirit of\r\nadmiration often amounting to reverence. Yet in the character of \"The\r\nPaladin,\" Edmond Aubrey, the old _miles gloriosus_ of Roman comedy, and\r\nin Joan's uncle, the historian reverted to his broadest jocosities.\r\nThere are interpolated pages of pure farce. There are scenes in \"Joan\"\r\nthat are companion pieces with portions of the sardonic \"Man that\r\nCorrupted Hadleyburg.\" On his seventy-third birthday he wrote, \"I like\r\nthe 'Joan of Arc' best of all my books; and it _is_ the best; I know\r\nit perfectly well.\" Yet this serious chronicle, with its occasional\r\noutbursts of fun, was of a piece with his best-known book of nearly\r\nthirty years earlier, the laugh-invoking \"Innocents Abroad.\" The books\r\nare not alien to each other; the difference is simply in the prevailing\r\nmoods.\r\n\r\nFor under all the frolicsome gayety and beneath the surface ironies of\r\nthis log of \"The Quaker City\" there is a solid sense of the realities\r\nof human life. Over against the pure fun of such episodes as the\r\nFourth of July celebration on the high seas is a steady run of satire\r\nat the traditionalized affectations of the American who pretended to\r\nenjoy the things that he ought and attempted to shake off the manners\r\nof Bird City when he registered in his Paris hotel. His gibes at\r\ncultural insincerity, however, did not degenerate into a fusillade\r\nof cheap cynicisms at everything old. Whatever contempt he felt for\r\nthe antiques of the tradesmen was overshadowed by the solemnity with\r\nwhich the evidence of the passing centuries impressed him. He may not\r\nhave rendered the \"old masters\" their full deserts, but he entered a\r\ncathedral with respect, walked in reverent silence among the ruins of\r\nthe Holy Land, and felt in the Alps the presence of the Most High.\r\n\"Notwithstanding it is only the record of a picnic,\" he wrote in the\r\npreface, \"it has a purpose, which is, to suggest to the reader how\r\n_he_ would be likely to see Europe and the East, if he looked at them\r\nwith his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those\r\ncountries before him.\" So he wrote this book out of the fullness of his\r\nheart as well as out of the abundance of his humor. There was in him a\r\nnatural acumen which for want of a better name we may call wisdom. His\r\ninstinctive perceptions were usually right.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental Mark Twain was an increasingly serious man. Before he\r\nwas fifty years old his precocious daughter had written in her journal,\r\n\"He is known to the public as a humorist, but he has much more in\r\nhim that is earnest than that is humorous.\" And again: \"Whenever we\r\nare all alone at home nine times out of ten he talks about some very\r\nearnest subject (with an occasional joke thrown in), and he a good deal\r\nmore often talks upon such subjects than upon the other kind. He is\r\nas much a philosopher as anything, I think.\" There were many external\r\nreasons for his turn of mind. His romantic passage through life from\r\nobscure poverty to wealth and fame, with the depressing chapters of\r\nhis temporary business reverses, heightened his native respect for\r\nthe few blessings that are really worth while. His repeated travels,\r\nculminating with his trip around the world, the honors that came to\r\nhim, the social distinctions that were showered on him, his friendships\r\nwith thinking men, his bereavements, all contributed to the same end of\r\nmaking him consider the ways of the world and of the maker thereof. In\r\na further comment his astute little daughter went near to the heart of\r\nthe matter when she wrote quaintly, \"I think he could have done a great\r\ndeal in this direction if he had studied while young, for he seems\r\nto enjoy reasoning out things, no matter what; in a great many such\r\ndirections he has greater ability than in the gifts which have made him\r\nfamous.\" \"If he had studied while young\" Mark Twain might have gained\r\na knowledge of the progressions in philosophic thought that would have\r\nsteadied him in his own thinking. Yet possibly it would have made\r\nlittle difference, for his thinking was at the same time all his own\r\nand altogether in the drift of nineteenth-century thought.\r\n\r\nWith an initial distrust of conventionalized thinking he came to\r\nhis own analysis of the prevailing religious views. His reason was\r\nalert to challenge theology wherever it was at odds with science. He\r\nfound nothing in the Bible to question the assumption that Man was\r\nthe crowning triumph of his Creator, but everything in evolutionary\r\ndoctrine to suggest that Man was only a link in a far-evolving\r\nsuccession of higher forms. He found a God in the Old Testament who\r\nwas \"an irascible, vindictive, fierce and ever fickle and changeful\r\nmaster,\" though in the ordering of the material universe he appeared to\r\nbe steadfast, beneficent, and fair. His reason thus unseated his faith\r\nin the Scriptures and thereby his confidence in the creeds founded\r\nupon them. He lost the God of the Hebrews only to find his own \"in\r\nthe presence of the benignant serenity of the Alps,\" ... \"a spirit\r\nwhich had looked down, through the slow drift of ages, upon a million\r\nvanished races of men, and judged them; and would judge a million\r\nmore--and still be there, watching unchanged and unchangeable, after\r\nall life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant desolation.\"\r\n\r\nFor the after-life he could find no such assurance as he could for a\r\nCreator. For many men of his generation, and the one just before, the\r\nsolution when they found themselves in such a quandary was to take\r\nrefuge in the authority of the dogmas they had set out to question;\r\nmany of the most radical came back with relief to the protection of the\r\nRoman Catholic faith; but Mark Twain could not find his way into the\r\nharbor, glad as he might have been for the anchorage. There is a deep\r\npathos in the many passages of which the following is a type:\r\n\r\n  To read that in a book written by a monk far back in the Middle Ages\r\n  would surprise no one; it would sound natural and proper; but when it\r\n  is seriously stated in the middle of the nineteenth century, by a man\r\n  of finished education, an LL.D., M.A., and an archæological magnate,\r\n  it sounds strangely enough. Still I would gladly change my unbelief\r\n  for Neligan's faith, and let him make the conditions as hard as he\r\n  pleased.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his yearnings he never could achieve for himself the\r\nassurance \"of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\"; so\r\nthat his most clearly formulated profession of faith was in reality a\r\npathetic profession of doubts:\r\n\r\n  I believe in God the Almighty.... I think the goodness, the justice\r\n  and the mercy of God are manifested in his works; I perceive they\r\n  are manifested toward me in this life; the logical conclusion is\r\n  that they will be manifested toward me in the life to come, if there\r\n  should be one.\r\n\r\nHere again, as in his discrimination between \"antiques\" and antiquity,\r\nMark Twain kept clear of a despairing cynicism and held to the\r\ndistinction between what Emerson called \"historical Christianity\" and\r\nthe ideals from which its adherents have fallen away. He judged the\r\nreligion of his countrymen by its social and national fruits, and he\r\nwas filled with wrath at the indignity of an Episcopal rector's refusal\r\nto perform the burial service of the actor George Holland and at the\r\nextortionate demands of the missionaries for indemnities after the\r\nBoxer Rebellion in China. On the national ideals of Christendom he\r\nspoke in bitter prophecy in 1908:\r\n\r\n  The gospel of peace is always making a deal of noise, always\r\n  rejoicing in its progress but always neglecting to furnish\r\n  statistics. There are no peaceful nations now. All Christendom is\r\n  a soldier camp. The poor have been taxed in some nations to the\r\n  starvation point to support the giant armaments which Christian\r\n  governments have built up, each to protect itself from the rest of\r\n  the Christian brotherhood, and incidentally to snatch any scrap\r\n  of real estate left exposed by a weaker owner. King Leopold II of\r\n  Belgium, the most intensely Christian monarch, except Alexander\r\n  VI, that has escaped hell thus far, has stolen an entire kingdom\r\n  in Africa, and in fourteen years of Christian endeavor there has\r\n  reduced the population from thirty millions to fifteen by murder\r\n  and mutilation and overwork, confiscating the labor of the helpless\r\n  natives, and giving them nothing in return but salvation and a home\r\n  in heaven, furnished at the last moment by the Christian priest.\r\n  Within the last generation each Christian power has turned the bulk\r\n  of its attention to finding out newer and still newer and more\r\n  and more effective ways of killing Christians, and, incidentally,\r\n  a pagan now and then; and the surest way to get rich quickly in\r\n  Christ's earthly kingdom is to invent a kind of gun that can kill\r\n  more Christians at one shot than any other existing kind. All the\r\n  Christian nations are at it. The more advanced they are, the bigger\r\n  and more destructive engines of war they create.\r\n\r\nSuch doubts as to the future and depression at surrounding events have\r\nled many an inquirer to a relaxation in his moral standards and in\r\nhis personal conduct; but in Mark Twain his rectitude was as deeply\r\ngrounded as his humor--both, indeed, flowing from the same source.\r\nThroughout his books he upheld the simple virtues--common honesty;\r\nfidelity to the family; kindness to brutes, to the weak or suffering,\r\nand to the primitive peoples. His ironies and his satires were always\r\ndirected at unworthy objects, the varied forms of selfishness and\r\ninsincerity; and his answer to \"What is Happiness?\" is contained in\r\nthe admonition, \"Diligently train your ideals upward and still upward,\r\ntoward a summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct\r\nwhich, while contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your\r\nneighbor and the community.\"\r\n\r\nNot until the last years of his life did readers begin to take Mark\r\nTwain seriously; now they are coming to appreciate him. He has been\r\nfortunate in his literary champions--biographers, critics, and\r\nexpositors--and incomparably so in the loving interpretation, \"My Mark\r\nTwain,\" by his intimate friend, William Dean Howells. This concludes:\r\n\"Out of a nature rich and fertile beyond any that I have ever known,\r\nthe material given him by the Mystery that makes a man and then leaves\r\nhim to make himself over, he wrought a character of high nobility\r\nupon a foundation of clear and solid truth.... It is in vain that I\r\ntry to give a notion of the intensity with which he pierced to the\r\nheart of life, and the breadth of vision with which he compassed\r\nthe whole world, and tried for the reason of things, and then left\r\ntrying.... Next I saw him dead.... I looked a moment at the face I\r\nknew so well; and it was patient with the patience I had so often seen\r\nin it; something of puzzle, a great silent dignity, an assent to what\r\nmust be from the depths of a nature whose tragical seriousness broke\r\nin the laughter which the unwise took for the whole of him. Emerson,\r\nLongfellow, Lowell, Holmes--I knew them all--and all the rest of our\r\nsages, poets, seers, critics, humorists; they were like one another\r\nand like other literary men; but Clemens was sole, incomparable, the\r\nLincoln of our literature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Authors_=\r\n\r\n  BRET HARTE.

Sill, after an\r\nEastern education, enjoyed two prolonged residences in California, and\r\nin his journeyings back and forth became a kind of cultural medium,\r\nbringing something of Eastern tradition to the Pacific coast and\r\ninterpreting the West to the East. Of the four men Joaquin Miller was\r\nthe most completely and continuously Western. He went out almost as\r\nearly as Mark Twain did, lived during boyhood in far more primitive\r\ncircumstances, and, after varied travels in the East and in Europe and\r\nintimate association with the world of letters, returned to the West\r\nfor his old age, dying \"on the heights\" in sight of the Golden Gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EDWARD ROWLAND SILL (1841-1887)\r\n\r\nSill was born in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1841. In 1861 he was\r\ngraduated from Yale, where he had developed more clearly than anything\r\nelse a dislike for narrowly complacent orthodoxy of thought and conduct\r\nand had acquired a strain of mild misanthropy which characterized him\r\nfor the next several years. His health sent him West, by sailing-vessel\r\naround Cape Horn, and he stayed in California occupied in a variety\r\nof jobs until 1866. A winter's study satisfied him that he should not\r\nenter the ministry, and a shorter experiment that he could not succeed\r\nin New York journalism. In 1868 he published the only volume of poems\r\nduring his lifetime, the little duodecimo entitled \"The Hermitage.\"\r\nFrom this year to 1882 he was occupied in teaching--first in the high\r\nschools at Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and Oakland, California, and from 1874\r\non in the department of English in the University of California. Here\r\nhe had the double distinction of serving under President Daniel C.\r\nGilman and over Josiah Royce, whom he secured as assistant. A letter\r\nof 1882 gives as the reason for his resignation that his \"position\r\nhad become intolerable for certain reasons that are not for pen and\r\nink,\" in spite of which ill health is usually assigned as the cause.\r\nIn 1883 a second volume, \"The Venus of Milo, and Other Poems\" was\r\nprivately printed. For the rest of his life he lived at Cuyahoga Falls\r\nagain, writing frequently under the name of Andrew Hedbrook for the\r\n_Atlantic_, whose pages were opened to his prose and verse through the\r\nappreciative interest of the editor, his fellow-poet, Thomas Bailey\r\nAldrich. He died in 1887.\r\n\r\nDuring his last thirty years, from his entrance to Yale in 1857 to\r\nhis death in 1887, Edward Rowland Sill experienced American life in a\r\nvariety of ways which were not exactly paralleled in the career of any\r\nof his contemporaries. He did not belong to any literary group. Because\r\nof a certain timidity, which was probably more artistic than social, he\r\ndid not even become acquainted with the well-known authors who were his\r\nneighbors while he was in Cambridge and New York City; but his natural\r\ninclination to find his proper place and do his proper work led him to\r\npartake of the life on both coasts and in the Mississippi Valley and\r\nto contribute richly to the leading periodicals of the East and the\r\nWest--the _Atlantic_ and the _Overland Monthly_.\r\n\r\nBy inclination he was from the outset a cultured radical. He loved the\r\nbest that the past had to offer, he wanted to make the will of God\r\nprevail, and he was certain that between lethargy and crassness the\r\nmillennium was being long delayed. It was lethargy which characterized\r\nYale and New Haven for him.[37] The curriculum was dull in itself\r\nand little redeemed by any vital teaching or by reference to current\r\nthought. The faculty, wrote one of his classmates, \"gave us a rare\r\nexample of single-hearted, self-sacrificing, and unswerving devotion\r\nto duty, as they saw it. But they had not the gift to see much of\r\nit, and so their example lacked inspiration. It is astounding that\r\nso much knowledge (one-sided though it was) and so much moral worth\r\ncould have existed side by side with so much obtuseness.\" The natural\r\nconsequence was that Sill picked up what crumbs of comfort he could\r\nfrom miscellaneous reading, was \"rusticated\" for neglect of his routine\r\nduties, wrote Carlylesque essays of discontent, and went out from\r\ngraduation with a deep feeling of protest against what he supposed\r\nwas the world. \"Morning\" and \"The Clocks of Gnoster Town, or Truth by\r\nMajority\" are the chief poetical results of this experience.\r\n\r\n  [37] See chap. ii, \"His Life at College,\" in W. B. Parker's Life.\r\n\r\nCalifornia offered him a relief, but too much of a relief. He was\r\nalways loyal to his closest college friends and to his ideals for Yale.\r\nThe license of a frontier mining country did not in any sense supply\r\nthe freedom which New Haven had denied him. His greatest pleasure out\r\nthere was in the companionship of an intellectual and music-loving\r\n\"Yale\" family. And so his revolt from the world and his return to\r\nit, which are motivated in \"The Hermitage\" by the charms of a lovely\r\nblonde, had a deeper cause in the facts of his spiritual adolescence.\r\nAll this pioneering was in the nature of self-discovery. For a while he\r\ninclined to the study of law because he thought the discipline of legal\r\ntraining would lead him toward the truth. Then after returning to the\r\nEast he came by way of theological study and journalism to his final\r\nwork: \"... only the great schoolmaster Death will ever take me through\r\nthese higher mathematics of the religious principia--this side of his\r\nschooling, in these primary grades, I never can preach.--I shall teach\r\nschool, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nNow that he had left it, however, the charm of California was upon him.\r\nAlthough he was later to write in sardonic comment on the dry season,\r\n\r\n      Come where my stubbly hillside slowly dries,\r\n      And fond adhesive tarweeds gently shade,\r\n\r\nhe was really in love with the great open vistas, the gentleness of the\r\nclimate, and with the Californians' \"independence of judgment; their\r\ncarelessness of what a barbarian might think, so long as he came from\r\nbeyond the border; their apparent freedom in choosing what manner of\r\nmen they should be; their ready and confident speech.\" \"Christmas in\r\nCalifornia,\" \"Among the Redwoods,\" and \"The Departure of the Pilot\" are\r\nexamples of much more California verse and of the spirit of many and\r\nmany of his letters. Yet for this radical thinker institutional life\r\nwas somewhat cramping even here. It is an unhappy fact that colleges\r\nand universities, devised as systems for educating the average by the\r\nslightly more than average, have rarely been flexible enough in their\r\nmanagement to give fair harborage for creative genius either in front\r\nof or behind the desk. Sill's experience was not unusual; it only went\r\nto prove that in academic America East was West and West was East and\r\nthat the two had never been parted. So finally the young poet, still\r\nyoung after two periods of residence on each coast, settled down again\r\nto quiet literary work in the little Ohio town. There were only five\r\nyears left him.\r\n\r\nThroughout his work, but increasingly in these later years, there\r\nis a fine and simple clarity of execution. The something in him\r\nwhich withheld him from calling on Longfellow and the others when in\r\nCambridge, or even on his fellow-collegian Stedman in New York, made\r\nhim slow to publish, rigorous in self-criticism, and eager to print\r\nanonymously or under a pseudonym. He wrote painstakingly, followed his\r\ncontributions to the editors with substituted versions, and revised\r\neven in the proof. Although he was a wide reader, he was usually\r\nindependent of immediate models, and always so in his later work. He\r\navoided the stock phrases of poetry, but often equaled the best of them\r\nhimself: \"the whispering pine, Surf sound of an aërial sea,\" \"Struck\r\nthrough with slanted shafts of afternoon,\" \"When the low music makes a\r\ndusk of sound,\" are representatives of his own fresh coinage.\r\n\r\nA reading of Sill's poetry would reveal much of his life story without\r\nother explanation. An acquaintance with his biography makes most of the\r\nrest clear. The poems relate in succession to his college experience,\r\nhis lifelong search for truth, his Western voyage, his revolt against\r\nthe world and his return to it, his residence in California. They\r\nshow in parts of \"The Hermitage\" and in \"Five Lives\" his rebellion at\r\nthe incursions of science. They show, however, that in his own mind\r\na greater conflict than that between science and religion was the\r\nconflict, as he saw it, between religion and the church.\r\n\r\n  For my part I long to \"fall in\" with somebody. This picket duty is\r\n  monotonous. I hanker after a shoulder on this side and the other.\r\n  I can't agree in belief (or expressed belief--Lord knows what the\r\n  villains really think, at home) with the \"Christian\" people, nor\r\n  in spirit with the Radicals, etc.... Many, here and there, must be\r\n  living the right way, doing their best, hearty souls, and I'd like\r\n  to go 'round the world for the next year and take tea with them in\r\n  succession.\r\n\r\nThe tone of this letter, written in 1870, was to prevail more and\r\nmore in his later years. He had passed out from the rather desperate\r\nseriousness of young manhood. He had found that on the whole life was\r\ngood. He was no less serious at bottom than before, but in the years\r\napproaching the fullness of his maturity he let his natural antic humor\r\nplay without restraint. As a consequence the poems after 1875 tend as a\r\ngroup to deal more often with slighter themes and in lighter vein. The\r\nhuman soul did not cease to interest him, but the human mind interested\r\nSill the husband and the teacher more than they had interested Sill\r\nthe youthful misanthrope. Thus the confidence in \"Force,\" the subtlety\r\nin \"Her Explanation,\" the mockery in \"The Agile Sonneteer,\" and the\r\nwhimsical truth of \"Momentous Words\" were all recorded after he was\r\nforty years of age.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to feel the incompleteness of his career. It was\r\ncut off without warning while Sill was in a state of happy relief from\r\nthe perplexities of earlier years. He was gaining in ease and power of\r\nworkmanship. There was a modest demand, in the economic sense, for his\r\nwork. There was everything to stimulate him to authorship and much to\r\nsuggest that in time he would pass beyond this genial good humor into\r\na period of serene and broadening maturity. Possibly in another decade\r\nhe would have come into some sense of nationalism which would have\r\nilluminated for him the wide reaches of America which he had passed and\r\nrepassed. The Civil War had meant nothing to him: \"What is the grandeur\r\nof serving a state, whose tail is stinging its head to death like a\r\nscorpion!\" Since war times he had passed out of hermitage into society,\r\nand with the Spanish War he might have seen America and the larger\r\nhuman family with opened eyes. But at forty-six the arc of his life was\r\nsnapped off short.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JOAQUIN MILLER (1841-1913)\r\n\r\nCincinnatus Hiner Miller was born in 1841. \"My cradle was a covered\r\nwagon, pointed west. I was born in a covered wagon, I am told, at or\r\nabout the time it crossed the line dividing Indiana from Ohio.\" His\r\nfather was born of Scotch immigrant stock--a natural frontiersman, but\r\na man with a love of books and a teacher among his fellow-wanderers.\r\nIn 1852, moved by the same restlessness that had taken the Clemens\r\nfamily to Missouri seventeen years earlier, the Millers started on the\r\nthree-thousand-mile roundabout journey to Oregon, finding their way\r\nwithout roads over the plains and mountains in a trip lasting more than\r\nseven months. It was from this that the boy gained his lasting respect\r\nfor the first pioneers.\r\n\r\n        O bearded, stalwart, westmost men,\r\n      So tower-like, so Gothic built!\r\n      A kingdom won without the guilt\r\n      Of studied battle, that hath been\r\n      Your blood's inheritance.... Your heirs\r\n      Know not your tombs: The great plough-shares\r\n      Cleave softly through the mellow loam\r\n      Where you have made eternal home,\r\n      And set no sign. Your epitaphs\r\n      Are writ in furrows.\r\n\r\nAfter two years in the new Oregon home the coming poet ran away with a\r\nbrother to seek gold. They seem to have separated, and in the following\r\nyears the one who came to celebrity survived a most amazing series of\r\nprimitive experiences and primitive hardships among the Indians. Part\r\nof his time, however, with \"Mountain Joe\" preserved his contact with\r\nbooks, for this man, a graduate of Heidelberg, helped him with his\r\nLatin. The boy returned to Oregon early enough to earn a diploma at\r\nColumbia University in 1859,--an institution in which the collegiate\r\nquality was doubtless entirely restricted to its name. According to\r\nMiller the eagerness of study there was no less intense than the\r\nzest for every other kind of experience among the early settlers. In\r\nthe next decade he had many occupations. For a while he was express\r\nmessenger, carrying gold dust, but safe from the Indians, who had\r\nbecome his trusted friends. \"Those matchless night-rides under the\r\nstars, dashing into the Orient doors of dawn before me as the sun burst\r\nthrough the shining mountain pass,--this brought my love of song to\r\nthe surface.\" Later he was editor of a pacifist newspaper which was\r\nsuppressed for alleged treason. But the largest proportion of his time\r\nwas spent at the law. From 1866 to 1870 he held a minor judgeship.\r\n\r\nThroughout all this time--he was now nearly thirty--Miller's primary\r\npassion had been for poetry and for casting in poetic form something\r\nof the rich, vivid romance of the great West and Southwest. In 1868\r\na thin booklet, \"Specimens,\" was issued and in San Francisco, in\r\n1869, \"Joaquin et al.\" For naming his book in this fashion instead of\r\n\"Joaquin and Other Poems,\" his legal friends repaid him with a derisive\r\nnickname that finally became the one by which the world knows him. Bret\r\nHarte, then in an influential editorship, gave the book a fair review,\r\nbut in general it was slightingly treated.\r\n\r\nImpulsive in mood and accustomed to little respect for the hardships of\r\ntravel, Miller started East, and three months later, as he records, was\r\nkneeling at the grave of Burns with a definite resolve to complete his\r\nlife in the country of his forefathers. In the volume of poems of his\r\nown selection he wrote of \"Vale! America,\" \"I do not like this bit of\r\nimpatience nor do I expect anyone else to like it, and only preserve it\r\nhere as a sort of landmark or journal in my journey through life.\" But\r\nfor the moment in his sensitiveness he doubtless wrote quite truly:\r\n\r\n                                I starve, I die,\r\n      Each day of my life. Ye pass me by\r\n      Each day, and laugh as ye pass; and when\r\n      Ye come, I start in my place as ye come,\r\n      And lean, and would speak,--but my lips are dumb.\r\n\r\nHe had, of course, no reputation in London, where he soon settled near\r\nthe British Museum, and the period was an unpropitious one for poetry.\r\nA descendant and namesake of the John Murray who had refused to deal\r\nwith \"The Sketch Book\" (see p. 118) gave a like response to Miller's\r\noffer of his \"Pacific Poems.\" But Miller carried the risk-taking spirit\r\nof the pioneer to the point of privately printing one hundred copies\r\nand sending them broadcast for review, with the result of an immediate\r\nand enthusiastic recognition. The \"Songs of the Sierras\" were soon\r\nregularly published in London, and the poet was received in friendliest\r\nfashion as a peer of Dean Stanley, Lord Houghton, Robert Browning, and\r\nall the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1873 to 1887 is distinctly a middle zone in Miller's\r\ncareer. The restless eagerness of his formative years still dominated\r\nhim, but it led him for the most part to rapid changes, most of which\r\nwere in the world of men and many of which were in the largest cities.\r\nHis moves on both continents are difficult to follow and have not been\r\nclearly unraveled by any biographer. One can get a fairly clear idea of\r\ntheir nature if not of their order by an attentive reading of his poems\r\nand particularly of the chatty footnotes with which he accompanied the\r\ncollections he edited. He continued to use the frontier experience\r\nof the early days. His most characteristic poems were stories of\r\nthrilling experience in the open. In \"My Own Story,\" \"Life Amongst the\r\nModocs,\" \"Unwritten History, Paquita,\" and \"My Life Among the Indians\"\r\nhe recorded the same material in prose. In certain other poems,\r\nparticularly the \"Isles of the Amazons\" and \"The Baroness of New York,\"\r\nhe set in contrast the romance of the forest with the petty conventions\r\nof the metropolis, and in \"The Song of the South\" he attempted--not to\r\nhis own satisfaction--to do for the Mississippi what he had done for\r\nthe mountains. Shorter lyrics show his response to world events such as\r\nthe death of Garfield and the American war with Spain. In two poems of\r\n1901 he wrote in withering condemnation of England's policy toward the\r\nBoers.\r\n\r\nIn all the material of this middle period the dominant feature is his\r\npraise of the elemental forces of nature. Nature itself for him was\r\nalways dynamic. The sea and the forest at rest suggested to him their\r\nlatent powers. His best scenes deal with storm, flood, and fire, and\r\nwhen occasionally he painted a calm background, as in the departure of\r\n\"The Last Taschastas,\" the burnished beauty of the setting is in strong\r\ncontrast with the violence of the episode. In human experience he most\r\nadmired the exertion of primitive strength. It is this which endeared\r\nthe early pioneers to him. Man coping with nature thrilled him, but\r\nfor human conflict he had little sympathy. His women were Amazonian\r\nin physique and character--a singularly consistent type, almost a\r\nrecurrence of one woman of various complexions. In the judgment of\r\nWhitman--his Washington intimate of two years--he must have fallen\r\nfrom grace in his treatment of love. If he did not vie (to paraphrase\r\nBurroughs) \"with the lascivious poets in painting it as the forbidden\"\r\npassion, he did compete with the fleshly school in depicting all its\r\ncharms. Yet even here in that strange concluding romance \"Light\" he\r\nstruggled to overcome the sensuous with the spiritual element.\r\n\r\nThe form of all this mid-period work was quite conventional and, in\r\nview of the content, smacked strangely of the library and the drawing\r\nroom. He ran as a rule to four-stressed lines, indulged in insistent\r\nriming, rarely missing a chance, and cast his stanzas into a jogging\r\nand seldom-varied rhythm. In their assault on the ear his verses have\r\nlittle delicacy of appeal. They blare at the reader like the brasses\r\nin an orchestral fortissimo. They clamor at him with the strident\r\nregularity of a Sousa march. This dominant measure accords well with\r\nthe rude subject matter of his poems,--the march of the pioneer, the\r\nplod of oxen yoked to the prairie schooner, the roar of prairie fire or\r\nof the wind through the forest; and, with a difference, the hoof-beat\r\nof galloping horses or of stampeding buffalo. And it expresses the\r\nrhetorical magniloquence which is the natural fruit of life in a\r\ncountry of magnificent distances. At the same time Miller found a\r\npoetical justification for his style in the narrative rhythms of Scott\r\nand Byron and Coleridge, by whom he was often and evidently influenced.\r\nUntil he was well past mid-career he was boyishly open to direct\r\nliterary influences. He had no theory of prosody; his originality was\r\ninherent in the harmony between himself and his wild material; so he\r\ntried his hand at writing in the manner of this, that, and the other\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn his final revisions, however, he was ruthless in rejecting his\r\nimitative passages and in his reduction of earlier work to what was\r\nunqualifiedly his own. This is best illustrated by what he did to \"The\r\nBaroness of New York\" before he had done with it. In its original\r\nform of 1877 it filled a whole volume, a poem--not a novel, as often\r\nerroneously stated--in two parts. The former is a sea-island romance\r\nof love and desertion after the manner of Scott; the sequel presents\r\nAdora in New York as the Baroness du Bois, where she lives in scornful\r\nindifference until the original lover turns up with a title of his own\r\nand carries her off in triumph; this second part is in the manner of\r\nByron. When Miller included this poem in his collected edition of 1897,\r\nhe dropped all the Byronic, metropolitan portion and reduced the rest\r\nto less than half--the fraction that was quite his own.\r\n\r\nSuch a revision was in the fullest sense the work of matured judgment.\r\nMiller was now in his last long period of picturesque retirement on\r\n\"The Heights,\" looking back over his prolific output of former years,\r\nrecognizing the good in it, and depending upon the public to reject\r\nwhat had no right to a long life. At times he still wrote poem-stories\r\nlocated in settings of tumultuous abundance, but he supplemented these\r\nwith more and more frequent short lyrics, and he studied continually\r\nto achieve that simplicity which is seldom the result of anything but\r\nperfected artistry. In 1902 he wrote:\r\n\r\n  Shall we ever have an American literature? Yes, when we leave sound\r\n  and words to the winds. American science has swept time and space\r\n  aside. American science dashes along at fifty, sixty miles an hour;\r\n  but American literature still lumbers along in the old-fashioned\r\n  English stage-coach at ten miles an hour; and sometimes with a\r\n  red-coated outrider blowing a horn. We must leave all this behind us.\r\n  We have not time for words. A man who uses a great, big, sounding\r\n  word, when a short one will do, is to that extent a robber of time. A\r\n  jewel that depends greatly on its setting is not a great jewel. When\r\n  the Messiah of American literature comes, he will come singing, so\r\n  far as may be, in words of one syllable.\r\n\r\nIn the main his hope now was to pass from objective poetry to \"the\r\nvision of worlds beyond,\"--a vision which he more nearly approached in\r\n\"Sappho and Phaon\" than in any other poem, and a vision for which the\r\nmotive is stated in the second stanza of \"Adios\":\r\n\r\n          Could I but teach man to believe--\r\n      Could I but make small men to grow,\r\n      To break frail spider-webs that weave\r\n      About their thews and bind them low;\r\n      Could I but sing one song and slay\r\n      Grim Doubt; I then could go my way\r\n      In tranquil silence, glad, serene,\r\n      And satisfied, from off the scene.\r\n      But ah, this disbelief, this doubt,\r\n      This doubt of God, this doubt of good,--\r\n      The damned spot will not out.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, by way of a practical application of his ideals,\r\nMiller was attempting to lead his life sanely and, by an association\r\nthat suggests the old Greek academy, to point the way for the younger\r\ngeneration of poets. In his final note to the 1902 edition he described\r\nhimself as living on \"a sort of hillside Bohemia.\" No lessons were\r\ntaught there except, by example, the lesson of living. Three or four\r\n\"tenets or principles of life\" were insisted upon: that man is good;\r\nthat there is nothing ugly in nature; that man is immortal; that nature\r\nwastes no thing and no time; and that man should learn the lesson of\r\neconomy. So in a way he returned to the simple conditions in which his\r\nearliest life had grounded his affections.\r\n\r\nMiller naturally invites comparison with Mark Twain and Walt Whitman.\r\nThe likeness starts with the simple origins of all three and with the\r\nrough-and-ready circumstances of their upbringing. It continues with\r\ntheir resultant sympathetic feeling for the common men and women who\r\nmake up the mass of humankind. It is maintained in their conscious\r\npersonal picturesqueness: Whitman gray-bearded, open-collared, wearing\r\nhis hat indoors or out; Mark Twain in his white serge, regardless\r\nof season; and Miller with long hair, velvet jacket, and high\r\nboots,--evidence of the humanizing personal vanity in each which was\r\nquite apart from the genuine bigness of their characters. It follows\r\nin the high seriousness of all three. And it is confirmed in the\r\nfact of their early recognition in England and their less respectful\r\nreception at home (see pp. 293 and 367). Miller, like these others,\r\nwas in the 70's what the Old World chose to think the typical American\r\nought to be. He was fresher to them than those other Americans whom\r\ntheir countrymen were eagerly describing as \"the American Burns,\"\r\n\"the American Wordsworth,\" \"the American Scott,\" and \"the American\r\nTennyson\"; and to this degree--though he was not a representative of\r\nthe prevailing American literature--he was actually a representative\r\nof the country itself and especially of the vast stretch from the\r\nMississippi to the Pacific. For Miller and the America he knew best\r\nwere both full of natural vigor, full of hope and faith, conscious of\r\nuntold possibilities in the nearer and the remoter future, and, withal,\r\nrelatively naïve and unformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Individual Authors_=\r\n\r\n  EDWARD ROWLAND SILL.

From period to\r\nperiod new emphasis is placed on old ideas, and old forms are given the\r\nright of way in literary fashion. In the course of American literature,\r\nroughly speaking, the dominating forms of literature have been in\r\nsuccession: exposition and travel during the colonial period; poetry,\r\nsatirical and epic, in the Revolutionary period; poetry in all its\r\nbroader aspects during the first two thirds of the nineteenth century.\r\nAfter the Civil War for fifty years fiction came to the front; from\r\nabout 1900 on a new emphasis was given to the stage and the playwright;\r\nat present the most striking fact in world literature is the broadening\r\nand deepening of the poetic currents again. Yet all of these forms are\r\nalways existent. To speak of the rise of fiction, then, is simply to\r\nacknowledge the increased attention which for a period it demanded.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said that America's chief contribution to world\r\nliterature has been the short story as developed since the Civil War.\r\nYet in America the ground had been prepared for this development by\r\nmany writers,--among them, as already mentioned in this history,\r\nWashington Irving with \"The Sketch Book\" in 1819 (see pp. 118-131),\r\nHawthorne with \"Twice-Told Tales\" in 1838 (see pp. 240 and 243), Poe\r\nwith his various contributions to periodical literature in the 1840's\r\n(see pp. 185-187), Mark Twain with \"The Jumping Frog\" of 1867, Bret\r\nHarte with \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" of 1870 and the great bulk of\r\nhis subsequent contributions (see p. 381), and Thomas Bailey Aldrich\r\nwith \"Marjorie Daw\" of 1873 and his other volumes of short stories. In\r\nthe meanwhile the novel had had its consecutive history--from Brockden\r\nBrown beginning with 1798 (see pp. 100-109) to Cooper in 1820 (see pp.\r\n141-157), William Gilmore Simms from 1833 (see p. 344), Hawthorne from\r\n1850 on (see pp. 236-251), Mrs. Stowe from 1852 (see pp. 299-309), and\r\nHolmes from 1861 (see pp. 320, 321). And these writers of short and\r\nlong fiction are only the outstanding story-tellers in America between\r\nthe beginning of the century and the years just after the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn a chapter such as this no exhaustive survey is possible, for it\r\ninvolves scores of writers and hundreds of books. The vital movement\r\nstarted with a fresh and vivid treatment of native American material,\r\nand it moved in a great sweeping curve from the West down past the\r\nGulf up through the southeastern states into New England, across to\r\nthe Middle West, and back into the Ohio valley until every part of the\r\ncountry was represented by its expositors. The course of this newer\r\nprovincial fiction is suggested by the mention of Mark Twain's \"Jumping\r\nFrog\" (1867, California), \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" of Bret Harte\r\n(1870, California), G. W. Cable's \"Old Creole Days\" (1879, Louisiana),\r\n\"Nights with Uncle Remus,\" by Joel Chandler Harris (1880, Georgia), \"In\r\nthe Tennessee Mountains,\" by Charles Egbert Craddock (1884), \"In old\r\nVirginia,\" by Thomas Nelson Page (1887), \"A New England Nun,\" by Mary\r\nE. Wilkins Freeman (1891), \"Main-Travelled Roads,\" by Hamlin Garland\r\n(1891, the Middle West), \"Flute and Violin,\" by James Lane Allen (1891,\r\nthe Ohio valley).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n CHRONOLOGICAL CHART II.

Although\r\nhe has been an Easterner by residence for nearly half a century,\r\nhe is the greatest contribution of the West--or what was West in his\r\nyouth--to Eastern life and thought.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1837 at Martins Ferry, Ohio,--the second of eight\r\nchildren. Perhaps the richness of his character is accounted for by the\r\nvaried strains in his ancestry. On his father's side his people were\r\nwholly Welsh except his English great-grandmother, and on his mother's\r\nwholly German except his Irish grandfather. His mother he has described\r\nas the heart of the family, and his father as the soul. The family\r\nfortunes were in money ways unsuccessful. His father's experience as a\r\ncountry editor took him from place to place in a succession of ventures\r\nwhich were harrassed by uncertain income and heavy debts. These were\r\nalways paid, but only by dint of unceasing effort. The Howells family\r\nwere, however, happy in their concord and in their daily enjoyment of\r\nthe best that books could bring them. Unlike many another youth who\r\nhas struggled into literary fame, William Dean found a ready sympathy\r\nwith his ambitions at home. His experience was less like Whitman's than\r\nBryant's. From childhood the printing office was his school and almost\r\nhis only school, for the district teachers had little to offer a child\r\nof literary parentage \"whose sense was open to every intimation of\r\nbeauty.\" Very early his desire for learning led him into what he called\r\n\"self-conducted inquiries\" in foreign languages; and with the help of a\r\n\"sixteen-bladed grammar,\" a nondescript polyglot affair, he acquired in\r\nturn a reading knowledge of Latin, Greek, Spanish, German, French, and\r\nItalian. In the meanwhile he was reading and assimilating the popular\r\nEnglish favorites. It was typical of his experience that Longfellow led\r\nhim to his first studies of the Spanish language, bringing him back\r\nto Spain, where he had traveled in fancy with Irving. Always he was\r\nwriting, for his life was \"filled with literature to bursting,\" and\r\nalways imitating--now Pope, now Heine, now Cervantes, now Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nAs a printer on country journals he had the opportunity to place his\r\nown wares before the public, often composing in type without ever\r\nputting pen to paper. His father encouraged him to contribute to\r\njournals of larger circulation, and the experience naturally led him\r\ninto professional journalism before he was of age. It led him also to\r\nColumbus, the state capital, where he reported the proceedings of the\r\nlegislature and in time rose to the dignity of editorial writer. During\r\nthese years of late youth and early manhood his aspirations were like\r\nBret Harte's, all in the direction of poetry, and his earliest book\r\nwas a joint effort with James J. Piatt, \"Poems of Two Friends,\" 1859.\r\nThis was a typical experience in literary history. Again and again at\r\nthe period of a change to a new form or, better, a revived artistic\r\nform, the literary youth has started to write in the declining fashion\r\nof his day and has been carried over into the rising vogue. \"Paradise\r\nLost\" was first conceived of as a five-act tragedy. \"Amelia\" and \"Tom\r\nJones\" were preceded by twenty-odd unsuccessful comedies. \"The Lay of\r\nthe Last Minstrel\" and \"Marmion\" and \"The Lady of the Lake\" were all\r\npreliminary to \"Waverley\" and the tide of novels that followed. In 1860\r\nHowells had five poems in the _Atlantic_ and had no expectation of\r\nwriting fiction; and it was another full decade, after the publication\r\nof several volumes of sketches and travel observations, before he was\r\nfairly launched on his real career.\r\n\r\nIn Columbus he had come by 1860 to a full enjoyment of an eager,\r\nbook-loving group. He was working enthusiastically as a journalist, but\r\nhis knowledge of politics and statecraft did not bring him to any vivid\r\nsense of the social order. \"What I wished to do always and evermore was\r\nto think and dream and talk literature, and literature only, whether in\r\nits form of prose or of verse, in fiction, or poetry, or criticism. I\r\nheld it a higher happiness to stop at a street corner with a congenial\r\nyoung lawyer and enter upon a fond discussion of, say, De Quincey's\r\nessays than to prove myself worthy the respect of any most eminent\r\ncitizen who knew not or loved not De Quincey.\" There was a succession\r\nof fellow-journalists with whom he could have this sort of pleasure,\r\nand there were houses in town where he could enjoy the finer pleasure\r\nof talking over with the girls the stories of Thackeray and George\r\nEliot and Dickens and Charles Reade as they appeared in rapid sequence\r\nin book or serial form. \"It is as if we did nothing then but read late\r\nnovels and current serials which it was essential for us to know one\r\nanother's minds upon down to the instant; other things might wait, but\r\nthese things were pressing.\" During these years he developed a liking\r\nfor the social amenities, of which an enjoyment of polite literature\r\nwas a natural expression. Literature was an adornment of life and, as\r\nhe saw it, was confined to an interpretation of individual experience.\r\n\r\nWith the presidential candidacy of Lincoln, Howells became one of his\r\ncampaign biographers, and after the election and a period of anxious\r\nwaiting he received the appointment as United States consul to Venice.\r\nUpon his return to this country he became an Easterner, settling\r\nhappily in Boston as assistant editor and then as editor in chief of\r\nthe _Atlantic Monthly_ from 1866 to 1881. This was a fulfillment beyond\r\nhis highest hopes. The great New England group were at the height of\r\ntheir fame, and his connection with the unrivaled literary periodical\r\nof America brought him into contact with them all. He was ready to\r\nbegin his own work as a writer of novels.\r\n\r\nFor the next twenty years he was a thoroughly conventional artist,\r\ngaining satisfaction and giving pleasure through the exercise of his\r\nadmirable technique. In this period he wrote always, to borrow an\r\nexpression originally applied to Tennyson, as though a staid American\r\nmatron had just left the room: a matron who had been nurtured on the\r\nreading which gave rise to his own literary passions--Goldsmith,\r\nCervantes, Irving, Longfellow, Scott, Pope, Mrs. Stowe, Dickens, and\r\nMacaulay; a matron, in short, who was the Lady of the Aroostook at\r\nforty-five, the mother of a numerous family, and aggressively concerned\r\nthat no book which fell into the hands of her daughters should cause\r\nthe blush of shame to rise upon the maiden cheek. He wrote not only\r\non an early experience in the life of this lady but on \"A Modern\r\nInstance,\" \"A Woman's Reason,\" \"Indian Summer,\" and, best of them all,\r\n\"The Rise of Silas Lapham.\" He was giving ground to Mr. Crothers's\r\npale-gray pleasures as a reader in the time when, as he said: \"I turned\r\neagerly to some neutral tinted person who never had any adventure\r\ngreater than missing the train to Dedham, and I ... analyzed his\r\ncharacter, and agitated myself in the attempt to get at his feelings,\r\nand I ... verified his story by a careful reference to the railroad\r\nguide. I ... treated that neutral tinted person as a problem, and I ...\r\nnoted all the delicate shades in the futility of his conduct. When, on\r\nany occasion that called for action, he did not know his own mind, I\r\n... admired him for his resemblance to so many people who do not know\r\ntheir own minds. After studying the problem until I came to the last\r\nchapter ... I ... suddenly gave it up, and agreed with the writer that\r\nit had no solution.\" Had nothing occurred to break the sequence, he was\r\non the way to wasting his energy, as Henry James did, \"in describing\r\nhuman rarities, or cases that are common enough only in the abnormal\r\ngroups of men and women living on the fringe of the great society of\r\nactive, healthy human beings.\"\r\n\r\nThe books of this period, in other words, were all the work of a\r\nwell-schooled, unprejudiced observer whose ambition was to make\r\ntranscripts of life. \"Venetian Life\" and \"Italian Journeys\" were the\r\nfirst logical expression of his desire and his capacities--books of\r\nthe same sort as \"Bracebridge Hall\" and \"Outre-Mer\" and \"Views Afoot\"\r\nand \"Our Old Home\" (see p. 269, note). \"A Foregone Conclusion\" and\r\n\"A Fearful Responsibility\" simply cross the narrow bridge between\r\nexposition and fiction but employ the same point of view and the same\r\ntechnique. Howells was interested in American character and in the\r\nnice distinctions between the different levels of culture. In \"Silas\r\nLapham,\" his greatest novel written before 1890, the blunt Vermonter is\r\nset in contrast with certain Boston aristocrats. He amasses a fortune,\r\nbecomes involved in speculation, in business injustice, and in ruin.\r\nBut whatever Howells had to say then of social and economic forces, he\r\nsaid of powers as impersonal as gravitation. Business was business, and\r\nthe man subjected to it was subjected to influences as capricious but\r\nas inevitable as the climate of New England.\r\n\r\nMore and more as a realist he devoted himself to the presentation of\r\ncharacter at the expense of plot. \"The art of fiction,\" he wrote in his\r\nessay on Henry James in 1882, \"has become a finer art in our day than\r\nit was with Dickens or Thackeray. We could not suffer the confidential\r\nattitude of the latter now nor the mannerism of the former any more\r\nthan we could endure the prolixity of Richardson or the coarseness\r\nof Fielding. These great men are of the past--they and their methods\r\nand interests; even Trollope and Reade are not of the present.\" He\r\ndismissed moving accidents and dire catastrophes from the field of\r\nthe new novel, substituting for fire and flood the slow smolder of\r\nindividual resentment and a burst of feminine tears. With \"April Hopes\"\r\nof 1887 he deliberately wrote an unfinished story, following two young\r\nand evidently incompatible people to the marriage altar, but leaving\r\ntheir subsequent sacrifice to the imagination of the reader, who must\r\nimagine his own sequel or go without.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he was past fifty he underwent a social conversion.\r\nAnd when he wrote his next book about his favorite characters, the\r\nMarches, he and they together risked \"A Hazard of New Fortunes.\" He\r\nand they were no longer content to play at life under comfortable and\r\nprotected circumstances. They went down into the metropolis, competed\r\nwith strange and uncouth people, and learned something about poverty\r\nand something about justice. In fact they learned what went into\r\n\"Annie Kilburn\" and \"The Quality of Mercy\" and \"The World of Chance\"\r\nand \"A Traveler from Altruria\" and \"The Eye of a Needle,\" learning it\r\nall through the new vision given by the belated reading of a great\r\nEuropean. Writing from his heart of this conversion Mr. Howells says,\r\nin \"My Literary Passions\":\r\n\r\n  It is as if the best wine at this high feast, where I have sat so\r\n  long, had been kept for the last and I need not deny a miracle in it\r\n  in order to attest my skill in judging vintages. In fact I prefer to\r\n  believe that my life has been full of miracles, and that the good\r\n  has always come to me at the right time, so that I could profit most\r\n  by it. I believe that if I had not turned the corner of my fiftieth\r\n  year, when I first knew Tolstoy, I should not have been able to know\r\n  him as fully as I did. He has been to me that final consciousness,\r\n  which he speaks of so wisely in his essay on Life. I came in it to\r\n  the knowledge of myself in ways I had not dreamt of before, and began\r\n  at last to discern my relations to the race, without which we are\r\n  nothing. The supreme art in literature had its highest effect in\r\n  making me set art forever below humanity, and it is with the wish to\r\n  offer the greatest homage to his heart and mind which any man can pay\r\n  another, that I close this record with the name of Lyof Tolstoy.\r\n\r\nThis passage we can hardly overvaluate. Taken by itself, it is merely a\r\npunctuation point in one author's autobiography, but seen against its\r\nbackground it records the epoch-marking fact that in the very years\r\nwhen America as one expression of itself was producing such native-born\r\nspokesmen as Whitman and Mark Twain and Joaquin Miller, it was also,\r\nin the spiritual successor to Longfellow and Lowell, making reverent\r\nacknowledgment, not to the splendors of an ancient civilization but\r\nto the newest iconoclasm in the Old World. It is not unworthy of\r\ncomment that the influence of Tolstoy was exerted upon Howells after\r\nhis removal to New York City, where he has been associated with the\r\neditorial staff of _Harper's Magazine_ ever since 1881, and that\r\nthe experiences of the Marches in their hazard of new fortunes is\r\napparently autobiographical.\r\n\r\nThere was no violent change in the material or method of his\r\nfiction-writing. It was simply enriched with a new purpose. To his old\r\npower to portray the individual in his mental and emotional processes\r\nhe added a criticism of the rôle the individual played in society. He\r\nadded a new consciousness of the institution of which the individual\r\nwas always the creator, sometimes the beneficiary, and all too often\r\nthe victim. His maturity as a man and as a writer secured him in his\r\nhuman and artistic equilibrium, and in this degree has distinguished\r\nhim from younger authors who have written with the same convictions\r\nand purposes. He has written no novels as extreme as Sinclair's \"The\r\nJungle,\" which ends with a diatribe on socialism, although he has been\r\na socialist; he has written nothing quite so insistent as Whitlock's\r\n\"The Turn of the Balance,\" although he has been keenly aware of the\r\ndifference between justice and the operation of the legal system. Every\r\nstory has contained a recognition that life is infinitely complex,\r\nwith a great deal of redeeming and a great deal of unintelligent and\r\nbaffling good in it. Furthermore, he has written always out of his own\r\nexperience and with all his old skill as a novelist, so that he has\r\nnever done anything so clumsily commendable as Page's \"John Marvel,\r\nAssistant\" or anything so clearly prepared for by painstaking study as\r\nChurchill's \"The Inside of the Cup.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1894 Howells had come to the point where he wished to present his\r\nsocial thesis as a thesis, and he did so in \"A Traveler from Altruria,\"\r\nwhich is not a novel at all but a series of conversations on the nature\r\nof American life as contrasted with life in an ideal state. Mr. Homos\r\nfrom Altruria (Mr. Man from Other Land) is the traveler who gets his\r\nfirst impressions of America by visiting a conservative novelist, Mr.\r\nTwelvemough, at a summer resort in which the hotel furnishes \"a sort\r\nof microcosm of the American republic.\" Here, in addition to the host,\r\nare an enlightened banker, a complacent manufacturer, an intolerant\r\nprofessor of economics, a lawyer, a minister, and a society woman \"who\r\nas a cultivated American woman ... was necessarily quite ignorant\r\nof her own country, geographically, politically and historically\";\r\nand here also are the hotel keeper, the baggage porter, a set of\r\ncollege-girl waitresses, and a surrounding population of \"natives,\"\r\nas the summer resorter invidiously describes the inhabitants whom he\r\ndoesn't quite dare to call peasants. In the earlier part of the essay\r\nthe social cleavages are embarrassingly revealed,--the ignominy of\r\nbeing a manual laborer or, worse still, a domestic servant, and the\r\nconsequent struggle to escape from toil and all the conditions that\r\nsurround it. This leads quickly to a study of the economic situation in\r\na republic where every man is for himself.\r\n\r\nWhen pinned by embarrassing questions the defenders of the American\r\nfaith take refuge in what they regard as the static quality of human\r\nnature, but are further embarrassed by the Altrurian's innocent\r\nsurprise at their tactics. He does not understand that it is in human\r\nnature for the first-come to be first served, or for every man to be\r\nfor himself, or for a man \"to squeeze his brother man when he gets him\r\nin his grip,\" or for employers to take it out of objecting employees\r\nin any way they can. To Mr. Twelvemough it is a matter of doubt as to\r\nwhether the traveler is ironically astute or innocently simple in his\r\nimplication that even human nature is subject to development.\r\n\r\nThe latter two thirds of the book are a composite indictment of an\r\neconomic system which permits slavery in everything but name and\r\nwhich extols the rights of the individual only as they apply to the\r\nproperty holder. This culminates with the concluding lecture by the\r\nAltrurian--an \"account of his own country, which grew more and more\r\nincredible as he went on, and implied every insulting criticism of\r\nours.\" The book concludes:\r\n\r\n  We parted friends; I even offered him some introductions; but his\r\n  acquaintance had become more and more difficult, and I was not sorry\r\n  to part with him. That taste of his for low company was incurable,\r\n  and I was glad that I was not to be responsible any longer for\r\n  whatever strange thing he might do next. I think he remained very\r\n  popular with the classes he most affected; a throng of natives,\r\n  construction hands, and table-girls saw him off on his train; and he\r\n  left large numbers of such admirers in our house and neighborhood,\r\n  devout in the faith that there was such a commonwealth as Altruria,\r\n  and that he was really an Altrurian. As for the more cultivated\r\n  people who had met him, they continued of two minds upon both points.\r\n\r\nThese are the convictions which dominate in all the later works. On the\r\nwhole it is a significant fact that novels of so radical a thesis have\r\nattracted so little opposition. Never was an iconoclast received with\r\nsuch unintelligent tolerance. The suavity of his manner, the continued\r\nappearance of his books of travel and observation, the recurrence (as\r\nin \"The Kentons\") to his old type of work or the resort (as in the long\r\nunpublished \"Leatherwood God\") to fresh woods and pastures new, and\r\nall the while the humorous presentation of his favorite characters,\r\nparticularly the bumptious young business man and the whimsically\r\nincoherent American woman, beguile his readers into a blind and bland\r\nassumption of Mr. Howells's harmlessness. Possibly because they have\r\nbeen less skillful and more explicit, novel after novel from younger\r\nhands has excited criticism and the healthy opposition which prove\r\nthat the truth has struck home. Perhaps his largest influence being\r\nindirectly exerted, his lack of sensationalism or sentimentalism debar\r\nhim from the \"best-seller\" class; but for fifty years he has been\r\nconsistently followed by the best-reading class, and no novelist of the\r\nnewer generation has been unconscious of his work.\r\n\r\nHenry James (1843-1916), whose work in some respects has been\r\ncomparable to that of Howells, was a writer of so distinct an\r\nindividuality that he has been the subject of much criticism and no\r\nlittle amiable controversy. Born in New York of literary parentage,\r\neducated in the university towns of Europe, and resident most of his\r\nlife abroad, he developed into an international novelist, chiefly\r\ninterested in the various shades of the contrasting cultures in the\r\nOld World and the New. Of his subject matter one story is about as\r\ngood an example as another, for James was remarkably consistent. The\r\nbackgrounds are almost always intercontinental or transatlantic.\r\nThe characters belong to the leisure class. The episodes, where they\r\nexist, are adventures of the mind. In the earlier stories, such as\r\n\"The American\" (1877), plot is more eventful and definitive and style\r\nis more lucid than in the later ones. In these James seemed to be\r\nso fascinated with his intricate discriminations of feeling that he\r\nconfined himself largely to psychological analysis in a style which\r\nbecame increasingly obscured by subtle indirections. Thus \"The Awkward\r\nAge\" (1899) is a narrative in ten short \"books\" centering about the\r\nmarriage and non-marriage of two London girls. Aggie, who has been\r\nbrought up in the fashion of Richard Feverel translated into feminine\r\nterms, is married off to a wealthy and decent man twice her age, and\r\nafter a short experience turns out to be altogether unfitted for his\r\ndegree of sophistication. Nanda, wise from the beginning, fails to\r\nwin the most attractive man of the lot, and in the end is adopted and\r\ncarried off to the country by a charming old Victorian gentleman.\r\nNothing objective happens. The tale is told in ten long conversations,\r\neach entitled for one of the chief characters and occupying most of\r\none of the books. All the characters talk with circuitous elusiveness,\r\nand all employ the same idiom, with the single exception of Aggie\r\nin her first two appearances, when she is supposed to be hopelessly\r\ningenuous. In his attitude toward these people James put himself in a\r\nsomewhat equivocal position. With their general social and spiritual\r\ninsufficiency he had no patience. They represent the world of \"Vanity\r\nFair\" and \"The Newcomes\" done down to date. But at the time he betrayed\r\na lurking admiration for them, their ways, and their attitude toward\r\nlife. Like the rest of his stories, \"The Awkward Age\" has little to do\r\nwith the world of affairs in any group aspect. It is like a piece of\r\nSwiss carving on ivory. It has the same marvelous minuteness of detail,\r\nthe same inutility, the same remote and attenuated relationship to any\r\ndeep emotional experience or vigorous human endeavor. Unless one is\r\ndevoted to the gospel of art for art's sake, one cannot appreciate the\r\ngood of this sort of endeavor. In his narrowly limited field Mr. James\r\nis a master. For more than forty years and in more than thirty volumes\r\nhe did the thing that he elected to without compromise in behalf of\r\npopularity. Yet admire him as much as they may, most readers turn\r\nfrom him with relief to the literature of activity and of the normal,\r\nhealthy human beings who are seldom to be encountered in the pages of\r\nHenry James.\r\n\r\nBefore mentioning in detail the types of American realistic novel which\r\nhave followed on the work of Mr. Howells, something should be said\r\nabout the very considerable output of romantic fiction of which he has\r\nbeen strangely intolerant; for it is strange that a man of his gentle\r\ngenerosity should be so insistent on the wrongness of an artistic point\r\nof view which is complementary to his own, though different from it.\r\nDistinctions between romance and realism often lead into a dangerous\r\n\"no man's land,\" and discussions of the term are harder to close than\r\nto begin. However, Sir Walter Raleigh's contention that the essence of\r\nromance lies in remoteness and the glamour of unfamiliarity--though not\r\ninclusive of all romance--will serve as an index for grouping here.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, 1880, and 1882 three men, the first of whom is still\r\nproducing, set out on long careers of popularity. They were George\r\nW. Cable (1844- ), Joel Chandler Harris (1848-1908), and F. Marion\r\nCrawford (1854-1909). Mr. Cable's contribution has been the\r\ninterpretation of the elusive and fascinating character of the New\r\nOrleans creole. Cable was bred in the river port when the old part of\r\nthe city was less like the decaying heart of a mushroom than it is\r\nto-day. He grew up in an understanding of the courtly, high-spirited\r\ngentry of this exotic people, not studying either the people or their\r\ntraditions for the sake of writing them up. He felt the beauty, but\r\nno less the futility, of their life. He was in no hurry to write for\r\npublication, but when he did so his fame was soon made. His subsequent\r\ndeparture from the South and his settling in New England seemed to\r\nmany critics to be an abandonment of the richest field that life had to\r\noffer him. It was said for years, until it became one of the literary\r\ncommonplaces, that Mr. Cable would never again rise to the level\r\nof \"Old Creole Days\" (1879), \"The Grandissimes\" (1880), or \"Madame\r\nDelphine\" (1881). The fourteen volumes of the next third of a century\r\nseemed to fulfill this dreary prophecy. Yet all the time the South was\r\nthe home of his imagination, and with 1918 he gave the lie to all his\r\nJeremiahs. The \"Lovers of Louisiana\" has quite as fine a touch as the\r\nworks of nearly forty years ago. Mr. Cable sees the old charm in this\r\nlife of an echoing past and the same fatuousness. At this distance\r\ninto the twentieth century he leads his old characters and their\r\nchildren by new paths into the future, but he presents the graces of\r\ntheir obsolescent life in the familiar narrative style of his early\r\nsuccesses--a style as fleeting yet as distinctive as the aroma of old\r\nlace.\r\n\r\nJoel Chandler Harris, like George W. Cable, did his work in presenting\r\nthe life of a vanishing race--the antebellum negro. He finished off his\r\nformal education, which ended when he was twelve, with the schooling\r\nof the printing shop, and passed from this into journalistic work\r\nwith a succession of papers, of which the _Atlanta Constitution_ is\r\nbest known. Boy life on the plantation gave him his material in the\r\nfolklore of the negro, and a chance bit of substituting gave him his\r\nvery casual start as the creator of \"Uncle Remus.\" Northern readers\r\nwere quick to recognize that Harris had given a habitation and a name\r\nto the narrative stuff that folklorists had already begun to collect\r\nand collate. The material goes back to the farthest sources of human\r\ntradition, but \"Uncle Remus\" was a new story-teller with a gift\r\namounting to little short of genius. So his stories have the double\r\ncharm of recording the lore of the negro and of revealing his humor,\r\nhis transparent deceitfulness, his love of parade, his superstition,\r\nhis basic religious feeling, and his pathos. Harris seemed to draw his\r\nmaterial from a bottomless spring. Starting with \"Uncle Remus: his\r\nSongs and Sayings\" in 1881, Harris produced six other volumes in the\r\nnext ten years and brought the total to fourteen in folk stories alone\r\nbefore his death in 1908. As the aptest of criticisms on his own work,\r\none of his admirers has well quoted Harris's comment on a book of Mark\r\nTwain: \"It is history, it is romance, it is life. Here we behold a\r\nhuman character stripped of all tiresome details; we see people growing\r\nand living; we laugh at their humor, share their griefs, and, in the\r\nmidst of it all, behold, we are taught the lesson of honesty, justice\r\nand mercy.\"\r\n\r\nThe fluent romance of Marion Crawford is of a different and a lower\r\norder. He was a sort of professional cosmopolitan,--American by birth,\r\neducated largely abroad, widely traveled, and resident for most of his\r\nmaturity on the Bay of Naples. He could turn off romances of Persia, of\r\nConstantinople, of Arabia, of medieval Venice, of Rome, and of England\r\nwith about equal success. He had no great artistic purpose, admitting\r\ncomplacently that he was not great enough to be a poet or clever enough\r\nto be a successful playwright. He had no ethical purpose. He had not\r\neven a high ideal of craftsmanship, putting out eight volumes in 1903\r\nand 1904 alone. He deserves mention as a prolific and self-respecting\r\nentertainer who converted his knowledge of the world into a salable\r\ncommodity and established a large market for his superficial romances.\r\n\r\nWith the turn of the century--almost two decades after the débuts\r\nof Cable, Harris, and Crawford--a new interest began to spread from\r\nthe collegians to the reading public as a whole, the same influences\r\nwhich were producing as leaders in the scholastic field Von Holst,\r\nChanning, McMaster, Hart, Jameson, and McLaughlin--masters of American\r\nhistory--extending to the people at large. In 1897 appeared Weir\r\nMitchell's \"Hugh Wynne.\" In the spring of 1898 came the war with Spain.\r\nIn 1899 Ford's \"Janice Meredith\" and Churchill's \"Richard Carvel\"\r\nwere published; in 1900, Mary Johnston's \"To Have and to Hold\"; and\r\nin 1901 Churchill's \"The Crisis\"--four novels which by the end of\r\nthe latter year had reached a combined sale of 1,200,000 copies. For\r\na little while the vogue of the historical romance passed all recent\r\nprecedent. The natural zest for stories of olden days was reënforced by\r\nthe revival of national feeling, and the popular authors of the moment\r\nreaped a golden harvest from the public, whom they at once charmed and\r\ninstructed.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, however, the describers and critics of contemporary\r\nAmerican life were by no means on the wane. In the shifting currents\r\nof fiction various types of realism have come to the surface and are\r\nconspicuous in the tide. They all fall under the definition formulated\r\nby Mr. Perry: the sort of fiction that \"does not shrink from the\r\ncommonplace or from the unpleasant in its effort to depict things as\r\nthey are and life as it is\"; but within this definition they may be\r\nseparated into two main classes. The first is the type that begins and\r\nends with portrayal of human life, deals with the individual, and aims\r\nonly to please. The second is written with the intent of pronouncing\r\na criticism on the ways of men as they live together, presents its\r\ncharacters against a social and institutional background, and aims\r\nto influence the opinions of its readers. The difference between the\r\ntwo is, of course, the difference between the earlier and the later\r\nnovels of Mr. Howells. In his later studies Mr. Howells is always\r\ndealing unaggressively but searchingly with the problem of economic\r\njustice, but this is only one of three broad fields. All modern\r\nproblem and purpose novels are devoted, simply or complexly, to the\r\nmarket--property; the altar--religion; and the hearthstone--domestic\r\nlife. This classification, which is useful only as long as it is\r\nemployed cautiously for a general guide, leads to a cross-survey of\r\nrecent fiction by kinds rather than by individual authors.\r\n\r\nThe number of more or less successful portrayers of provincial types\r\nin American fiction defies even enumeration. The most effective have,\r\nhowever, been unsatisfied with depicting the mere idiosyncrasies\r\nof a region heavily propped by dialect and have gone on to the\r\ninterpretation of life as it might express itself anywhere under\r\nsimilar conditions. Thus the \"Old Chester\" of Mrs. Margaret Deland\r\n(1857- ) is a study of isolated conservatisms thrown into relief\r\nby the wise sanity of Dr. Lavendar. Old Chester, we are told, is\r\nin Pennsylvania. It might be in any state or country where narrow\r\nrespectability could intrench itself. It is an American Cranford. In\r\nthe \"Old Chester Tales\" (1898) \"The Promises of Dorothea\" involve her\r\nutterly respectable elopement with Mr. King, whose worst offense in the\r\neyes of her guardian maiden aunts is that he has lived abroad for many\r\nyears. The implied departure from Old Chester customs is sufficient\r\ncondemnation. \"Good for the Soul\" culminates with the doctor's sensible\r\nadvice to Elizabeth Day, who, at the end of twelve years of happy\r\nmarriage, is oppressed by the memory of a Bohemian girlhood of which\r\nher husband is ignorant. \"Suppose,\" said the doctor, \"I hadn't found\r\nher a good woman, should I have told her to hold her tongue?\" \"The\r\nChild's Mother\" is the story of an unregenerate whose baby Dr. Lavendar\r\nkeeps away from her by a process we should call blackmail if it were\r\nnot practiced by a saint. Wide and varied as her output is, Mrs. Deland\r\nhas nowhere shown her artistry more finely than in the two Dr. Lavendar\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThe comments of Edith Wharton (1862- ) on American life are from\r\nthe cosmopolitan point of view and present a series of pictures of\r\nthe American woman which for harshness of uncharity are difficult\r\nto parallel. As a matter of fact America is so vast and varied\r\nthat there is no national type of woman. Mrs. Wharton's women are\r\nrepresentative of one stratum just as Christy's pictorial girls are.\r\nThey are the product of indulgence which makes them hard, capricious,\r\nand completely selfish. Lily Bart of \"The House of Mirth\" (1905)\r\nbegins high in the social scale, compromises reluctantly with moneyed\r\nambition, and in one instance after another defeats herself by delay\r\nand equivocation in a declining series of \"affairs.\" More approachable\r\nthan irreproachable, she suffers from the social beclouding of her\r\nreputation and, in the end, as a consequence of her low standards\r\nbut her lack of shamelessness she succumbs to the circumstances that\r\ncreated her and arrives at a miserable death. Undine Spragg, in \"The\r\nCustom of the Country\" (1913), first married and divorced in a Western\r\ntown is then brought to New York, introduced into society and \"made\"\r\nby her good looks and her brazen ambition. She wrecks the life of her\r\nsecond husband, a refined gentleman, and then as a result of much\r\nforeign residence marries a Frenchman of family. From him she runs\r\naway, finally to remarry Moffatt, who, throughout the story, has been\r\nher familiar spirit, subtly revealing his intimacy of feeling, and\r\nincreasing his hold upon her as he rises in the money world. The title\r\ngives the cue to the story as a whole and to its several parts. By\r\nnature Undine is coarse-grained, showy, and selfish; by upbringing she\r\nbecomes incorrigible. Her first and last husband is one of her own\r\nkind--sufficiently so that he is capable of resuming with her after her\r\nstreaky, intermediate career. The second is broken on her overweening\r\nselfishness; the third, by virtue of his ancient family tradition, is\r\nable to save himself though not to mold or modify her. At the end, with\r\nMoffatt and all his immense wealth, she is still confronted by \"the\r\ncustom of the country.\" Because of her divorces \"she could never be\r\nan ambassador's wife; and as she advanced to welcome her first guest\r\nshe said to herself that it was the one part she was really made for.\"\r\nThis is the Wharton formula: none of her women really triumphs. Lily\r\nBart's downfall is one with her death. She had breathed the stifling\r\natmosphere from her city childhood; what seemed to save Undine was the\r\ninitial vigor of her Western youth, but even she could not successfully\r\ndefy the ways of the world.\r\n\r\nHamlin Garland (1860- ) in 1891 achieved with his \"Main-Traveled\r\nRoads\" as quickly earned a reputation as Cable and Harris had done\r\nwith their first volumes. The son of a sturdy Western pioneer, he had\r\npassed a boyhood of incessant toil before breaking away to earn his\r\nown schooling, which culminated with several years of self-directed\r\nstudy in Boston. A vacation return in 1887 to Wisconsin, Dakota, and\r\nIowa revealed to him the story-stuff of his early life, and during the\r\nnext two years he wrote the realistic studies which won him his first\r\nrecognition. In them, he explained later, he tried to embody the stern\r\ntruth. \"Though conditions have changed somewhat since that time, yet\r\nfor the hired man and the renter farm life in the West is still a stern\r\nround of drudgery. My pages present it--not as the summer boarder or\r\nthe young lady novelist sees it--but as the working farmer endures it.\"\r\nTo the reader of Mr. Garland's work as a whole it is evident that the\r\nrichest part of his life was over with the writing of this book and \"A\r\nSpoil of Office\" (1892) and \"Rose of Dutcher's Coolly\" (1895). With the\r\nadoption of city life his interests became diffuse and miscellaneous,\r\nas his writing did also. The almost startling strength of \"A Son of the\r\nMiddle Border\" (1918) reënforces this conviction, for this late piece\r\nof autobiography is the story of the author's first thirty-three years\r\nand owes its fine power to the fact that in composing it Mr. Garland\r\nrenewed his youth like the eagle's. What he propounded in his booklet\r\nof essays, \"Crumbling Idols\" (1894), he illustrated in his stories\r\nup to that time. In them he made his best contribution to American\r\nliterature, except for this recent reminiscent volume. In almost every\r\nquarter of the country similar expositions of American life were\r\nmultiplied and to such an extent that Mrs. Deland, Mrs. Wharton, and\r\nMr. Garland are chosen simply as illustrations of an output which would\r\nrequire volumes for full treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the field of realism which is concerned with a criticism of\r\ninstitutional life, Mrs. Deland wrote a memorable book in \"John Ward,\r\nPreacher\" (1888). This was the same year in which Mrs. Humphry Ward's\r\n\"Robert Elsmere\" appeared. Both were indexes to the religious unrest of\r\nthe whole Victorian period,--an unrest apparent in America since the\r\nrise of the Unitarians and the activities of the Transcendentalists,\r\nand recorded in such novels as Mrs. Stowe's \"Oldtown Folks\" and Bayard\r\nTaylor's \"Hannah Thurston,\" as well as in the underlying currents\r\nof Holmes's Breakfast-Table series. The explicit story of John Ward\r\nis the tragic history of his love and marriage with Helen Jaffrey.\r\nThe implicit story is based on the insufficiency of religious dogma\r\ndetached from life. Mrs. Deland's convictions resulted later in the\r\ngenuine strength of her best single character, Dr. Lavendar, and in\r\nthe subordinate religious motif of \"The Iron Woman\" (1910) (see p.\r\n307). In recent years the narrative treatment of the problem to attract\r\nwidest attention has been Churchill's \"The Inside of the Cup\" (1913),\r\na story which one is tempted to believe gained its reading more from\r\nits author's reputation and the prevailing interest in the problem\r\nthan from its artistic excellence. Mrs. Stowe and Mrs. Ward wrote out\r\nof long experience in life; Mr. Churchill seems rather to have felt\r\nthe need of introducing this theme into his many-volumed exposition of\r\nAmerica and to have read up on the literature of the subject with the\r\nsame thoroughness that characterized his preparation for more strictly\r\nhistorical stories.\r\n\r\nThe novels of economic life are far more numerous and more urgent in\r\ntone. One of the earliest was John Hay's \"The Breadwinners\" (1883).\r\nIt is significant that this appeared anonymously, the talented poet\r\nand politician preferring not to be known as a story-teller. The labor\r\nunrest of the early 80's disturbed him. Desire for education seemed\r\nto result unfortunately, and with a very clear impatience Mr. Hay\r\nexpounded the hardships of wealth in the midst of a labor uprising.\r\nTo go to the root of the difficulty did not seem to occur to him.\r\nShortly after this early industrial novel Mr. Howells was to attack\r\nthe problem in a broader and deeper way (see pp. 418-421). And while\r\nHowells was still making his successive approaches a whole succession\r\nof younger men joined the assault. With many of them there was no such\r\nvital experience as their senior had passed through; they were rather\r\nwriting as journalists and utilizing the novel, sometimes clumsily and\r\noften feverishly. Few have done work which could at all compare with\r\nthat of Frank Norris (1870-1902). His interrupted trilogy--an epic of\r\nthe wheat--fulfilled the promise of his early efforts, \"Vendover and\r\nthe Brute\" and \"McTeague,\" and made his early death the occasion of a\r\ndeep loss. Of these three novels \"The Octopus\" (1901) forms the story\r\nof a crop of wheat and deals with the war between the wheat-grower\r\nand the railroad trust; the second, \"The Pit\" (1903), is a story of\r\nthe middleman; the third, \"The Wolf\" (never written), was to have\r\ndealt with the consumption in Europe. Norris's aspiration was no less\r\nthan that of his own character Presley, the poet. \"He strove for\r\nthe diapason, the great song which should embrace in itself a whole\r\nepoch, a complete era, the voice of an entire people....\" With a great\r\nimaginative grasp he conceived of the wheat as an enormous, primitive\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n  The Wheat that had killed Cressler, that had ingulfed Jadwin's\r\n  fortune and all but unseated reason itself; the Wheat that had\r\n  intervened like a great torrent to drag her husband from her side\r\n  and drown him in the roaring vortices of the Pit, had passed on,\r\n  resistless, along its ordered and predetermined courses from West to\r\n  East, like a vast Titanic flood, had passed, leaving Death and Ruin\r\n  in its wake, but bearing Life and Prosperity to the crowded cities\r\n  and centres of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe number and the temper of stories written without Norris's breadth\r\nof vision or skill brought down on many of their authors the epithet\r\nof \"muck-raker\" in common with the sensational writers of magazine\r\nexposures. Among the saner and, consequently, more effective purpose\r\nnovels the writings of Winston Churchill and Brand Whitlock have helped\r\nto offset the shrill cries of Upton Sinclair and Jack London.\r\n\r\nThe American novels which center about sex and the family have passed\r\nthrough rapid changes during the twentieth century. In 1902 Mr. Bliss\r\nPerry, discussing tendencies of American novelists in his \"A Study\r\nof Prose Fiction,\" declared that the American novel was free from\r\nequivocal morality, that \"people who want the sex-novel, and want it\r\nprepared with any literary skill, have to import it from across the\r\nwater,\" and concluded with the confident assertion that while American\r\nfiction \"may not be national, and may not be great, it will have at\r\nleast the negative virtue of being clean.\" A few pages later in the\r\nsame chapter he made an observing comment of which he failed to see the\r\nimplication when he noted that conversation between writers of fiction\r\nwas likely to center about men like Turgenieff, and Tolstoi, Flaubert\r\nand Daudet, Björnson and D'Annunzio. The influence of these men was\r\nsoon to be felt, both directly and through the medium of Englishmen\r\nfrom the generation of Hardy to that of Wells and Galsworthy. And\r\nwithin a dozen years it had extended so far that the National Institute\r\nof Arts and Letters went on record in warning and protest against\r\nthe morbid insistency of an increasing number of younger writers.\r\nThis wave was a symptom not only of a literary influence but, more\r\ndeeply, of the world-wide attempt to re-estimate the rights and duties\r\nand privileges of womankind. There are few subjects on which people\r\nof recent years have done more thinking, and few on which they have\r\narrived at less certain conclusions. With the collapse of the great\r\n\"conspiracy of silence\" that has surrounded certain aspects of personal\r\nand family life, it has been natural for the present generation to fall\r\ninto the same errors into which Whitman had fallen. Naturally, too,\r\nthe evil thinker seized on the occasion for evil speech. There has\r\nbeen every shade of expression from blatant wantonness to high-minded\r\nand self-respecting honesty. Thus we can account for Mr. Theodore\r\nDreiser, who seems to feel that freedom of speech should be gratefully\r\nacknowledged by indulgence to the farthest extreme. And thus we can\r\naccount for Mr. Ernest Poole, who, in \"His Family,\" has presented an\r\nextraordinarily fine summary of the broad and perplexing theme.\r\n\r\nThe English novel is nearing the end of its second century of\r\ninfluence. It is a constant in literature which will probably attract\r\nmore readers than any other single form. Yet it will have its times of\r\ngreater and lesser popularity, and it seems to have passed the height\r\nof a wave shortly after 1900. First the drama came forward with a new\r\nchallenge to serious attention, and of late poetry has reëstablished\r\nitself as a living language.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  BESANT, SIR WALTER.

There is no word about it in the substantial volumes\r\nby Richardson and Wendell, none in the ordinary run of textbooks,\r\nnot a mention of playwright, producer, actor, or stage even in the\r\nfour-hundred-odd pages of Pattee's \"American Literature since 1870.\"\r\nThis silence cannot, of course, be accounted for by any conspiracy\r\namong the historians; it must be acknowledged that in itself the period\r\nhad almost no dramatic significance. Quinn's collection of twenty-five\r\n\"Representative American Plays\" includes only three produced between\r\nthese dates. The basic reason for this is that literary conditions did\r\nnot induce or encourage play-writing in the English-speaking world\r\non either side of the Atlantic. The greatest artistry was expressing\r\nitself in poetry, and in America no major poet but Longfellow attempted\r\neven \"closet drama.\" The greatest genius in story-telling was let\r\nloose in the channel of fiction, and many of the successful novels\r\nwere given a second incarnation in play form. The names that stand\r\nout in stage history in these years are the names of controlling\r\nmanagers, like Lester Wallack and Augustin Daly, or of players, like\r\nCharlotte Cushman, Booth, Barrett, Jefferson, and Mansfield; and the\r\nwriters of plays--encouraged by stage demands rather than by literary\r\nconditions--were the theatrical successors of Dunlap and Payne (see\r\npp. 94-96)--men like Dion Boucicault (1822?-1890) with his hundred\r\nand twenty-four plays, and Bronson Howard (1842-1908) with his less\r\nnumerous but no more distinguished array of stage successes. Side\r\nby side with these, and quite on a level with them, rose one eminent\r\ncritic of stagecraft and the drama, William Winter (1836-1917).\r\n\r\nWith the last decade of the nineteenth century, however, a new\r\ngeneration of playwrights began to win recognition--men who knew\r\nliterature in its relation to the other arts and who wrote plays out of\r\nthe fullness of their experience and the depth of their convictions,\r\nhoping to reach the public with their plays but not concerned chiefly\r\nwith immediate \"box-office\" returns. The movement started in England\r\nand on the Continent and--as we can now see--in America as well, but\r\nthe traditional American neglect of American literature[38] led the\r\nfirst alert critics on this side the Atlantic to lay all their emphasis\r\non writers of other nationalities. Thus in 1905 James Huneker's\r\n\"Iconoclasts\" discussed Norwegian, French, German, Russian, Italian,\r\nBelgian, and English dramatists. E. E. Hale's \"Dramatists of To-day\"\r\nof the same year dealt with four from Huneker's list, substituted\r\none Frenchman, and added two Englishmen. This selection was quite\r\ndefensible, for the significant contemporary plays which reached the\r\nstage came from these sources. But by 1910 the drift of things was\r\nsuggested by the contents of Walter Pritchard Eaton's \"At the New\r\nTheatre and Others.\" In this book, of twenty-three plays reviewed, ten\r\nwere by American authors, and in the third section, composed of essays\r\nrelated to the theater, two of the chief units were discussions of\r\nClyde Fitch and William Winter. And the dedication of Eaton's book is\r\nperhaps the single item of greatest historical significance, for it\r\ngives due credit to Professor George P. Baker of Harvard as \"Founder\r\nin that institution of a pioneer course for the study of dramatic\r\ncomposition\" and as \"inspiring leader in the movement for a better\r\nappreciation among educated men of the art of the practical theater.\"\r\n\r\n  [38] See \"American Neglect of American Literature\" by Percy H.\r\n       Boynton. _Nation_ (1916), Vol. CII, pp. 478-480.\r\n\r\nThe field into which we are led is so broad and so near that in a brief\r\nexcursion we can undertake only a rough classification of the main\r\nproducts and the soil in which they are growing. Such a classification\r\nmay be found if we consider in turn first the better play written for\r\na better theater, which began to appear about 1890, then the various\r\nnew types of theater which grew from the people's interest instead of\r\nfrom managerial enterprise, and, finally, the literary drama in poetry\r\nor prose which profits from the coöperation of actor and stage-manager,\r\nbut can survive in print unaided.\r\n\r\n\"The movement for a better appreciation among educated men of the art\r\nof the practical theatre,\" although led by one college professor, was\r\nitself a symptom of fresh developments in the art to which he addressed\r\nhimself. Omitting--but not ignoring--the rise of the modern school of\r\nEuropean dramatists in the 1890's, we must be content for the moment\r\nto note that this decade brought into view in America several men who\r\nwere more than show-makers, even though they were honestly occupied in\r\nmaking plays that the public would care to spend their money for. The\r\nsignificant facts about these playwrights are that they gave over the\r\nimitation and adaptation of French plays, returned to American dramatic\r\nmaterial, and achieved results that are readable as well as actable.\r\nTheir immediate forerunners were Steele MacKaye (1842-1894) and James\r\nA. Herne (1840-1901)--the former devotedly active as a teacher of\r\nbudding players and as a student of stage technique, the latter the\r\nquiet realist of \"Shore Acres\" and other less-known plays of simple\r\nAmerican life. Coming into their first prominence at this time were\r\nAugustus Thomas (1859- ) and Clyde Fitch (1865-1909).\r\n\r\nThey both appeared as theatrical craftsmen of the new generation, and\r\nlike their prototypes in America, Dunlap and Payne (see pp. 96-98),\r\nthey wrote abundantly, for audiences rather than for readers, and\r\nwith definite actors and actresses in mind as they devised situations\r\nand composed lines. Clyde Fitch in twenty years wrote and produced\r\non the stage thirty-three plays and adapted and staged twenty-three\r\nmore--an immense output. In the first ten years the most important\r\nwere all built on historical themes: \"Beau Brummel,\" \"Nathan Hale,\"\r\nand \"Barbara Frietchie.\" It is easy to see and to say that in writing\r\nthese he was carrying on the tradition of Bronson Howard with his\r\nCivil War melodramas,--a half truth, however, since \"Beau Brummel\" in\r\nno way fits the generalization, and other plays of the decade were\r\non contemporary social life. In the second ten years the keynote was\r\nstruck with \"The Climbers,\" a social satire on a shallow city woman\r\nand her two daughters whose social ambition deadens them to any fine\r\nimpulses or natural emotions. In the long roster of Fitch's successes\r\na few constant traits are obvious. He built his stories well, set them\r\ncarefully, combined the resources of the playwright who knows how to\r\ndevise a \"situation\" with those of the stage-manager who knows how\r\nto present it, and cast his stories into simple, rapid-fire, clever\r\ndialogue. He took advantage of up-to-date material for the superficial\r\ndress of his plays, introducing the background of latest allusion,\r\nrecently coined turns of phrase, the newest songs, the quips and turns\r\nof fashion. And he went beneath the surface to the undercurrents\r\nof human motive as in the wifely constancy in \"The Stubbornness of\r\nGeraldine,\" the jealousy of \"The Girl with the Green Eyes,\" and the\r\nweak mendacity of Becky in \"The Truth.\" Fitch was never profound,\r\nnever sought to be; but he was deservedly popular, for he combined no\r\nlittle skill with an alert sense of human values in everyday life,\r\nand he brought an artistic conscience to his work. Because he was so\r\nsuccessful his influence on other dramatists has been far-reaching; and\r\nthose who have been neither too small nor too great to learn from him\r\nhave learned no little on how to write a play.\r\n\r\nMr. Augustus Thomas has lived in the atmosphere of the theater from\r\nboyhood. He began writing plays at fourteen, was directing an\r\namateur company at seventeen, and had his first New York success\r\nin his twenty-eighth year. Since 1887 he has been a professional\r\nplaywright; he has nearly fifty productions to his credit, and he is\r\nnow art director of the Charles Frohman interests. His first widely\r\nknown works were the plays of states: \"Alabama\" (1891), \"In Mizzoura\"\r\n(1893), and \"Arizona\" (1899)--plays which exerted the same general\r\nappeal as \"Shenandoah\" and \"Barbara Frietchie.\" As a practical man of\r\nthe theater he adapted and worked over material, dramatizing novels of\r\nMrs. Burnett, Hopkinson Smith, and Townsend. His attractive \"Oliver\r\nGoldsmith\" was built not only around the character of that whimsical\r\nman of letters but included as its own best portion an act out of the\r\nhero's play \"The Good-Natured Man.\" With the kind of adaptability\r\nwhich belongs equally to the practical man of the theater and to the\r\nenterprising journalist, he undertook in time the type of play that\r\ndeals with questions or problems of modern interest. The same current\r\nof speculation that led Mark Twain to write his essay on \"Mental\r\nTelepathy\" and Hamlin Garland his book on \"The Shadow World\" accounts\r\nfor Thomas's \"The Witching Hour\" (1907), which interweaves the strands\r\nof hereditary influence and mental suggestion; and he contributed his\r\nword on the complex problems of the modern family in \"As a Man Thinks\"\r\n(1911). Up to 1917 he had written and adapted forty-six plays, of which\r\neleven had been published after their production, but his work of real\r\ndistinction belongs to the period opening with \"The Witching Hour.\" In\r\nhis later plays he has coupled his highly developed ability to tell a\r\nstory with a vital feeling for the positive values in life. In \"The\r\nHarvest Moon\" he makes a playwright-character say, \"I would willingly\r\ngive the rest of my life to go back and take from my plays every word\r\nthat has made men less happy, less hopeful, less kind.\" And in \"The\r\nWitching Hour\" he declares through Jack Brookfield the text of that and\r\nsucceeding plays, \"You're a child of _the everlasting God_ and nothing\r\non the earth or under it can harm you in the slightest degree\"--a text\r\nwhich, said of the soul, is immortally true.\r\n\r\nIn a short chapter it is impossible to discuss in detail any other of\r\nthe play-writers who have done with less applause but with no less\r\ndevotion the kind of writing represented by the best of Fitch and\r\nThomas; and it would be invidious to attempt a mere list of the others,\r\nas if a mention of their names would be a sop to their pride. The case\r\nmust rest here with the statement that these two men were the leaders\r\nof an increasing group and that the desire to compose more skillful\r\nand more worthy plays was paralleled by a revival of respect for the\r\nmodern drama and the modern stage. This leads to the middle section\r\nof our survey, and turns from the drama itself to the fifteen-year\r\nstruggle for possession of the American stage--the actual \"boards\" on\r\nwhich the plays could be presented. It is as dramatic as any play,\r\nthis story of the conflict between intelligent idealism,--whether in\r\nplaywright, actor or theatergoer, and commercial greed,--and it is far\r\nfrom concluded, though a happy dénouement seems to be in sight.\r\n\r\nThe first step has already been mentioned: the development of a student\r\nattitude toward the contemporary play and its production. Professor\r\nBaker at Harvard and Professor Matthews at Columbia were looked at by\r\nsome with wonder and by others with amused doubt when they began as\r\nteachers to divide their attention between the ancient and the modern\r\nstage. Yet as the study progressed their students became not only\r\nintelligent theatergoers but constructive contributors, as critics and\r\ncreators, to the literature of the stage; and then in the natural order\r\nof events the whole student body came to realize that the older drama\r\nshould be reduced to its proper place and restored to it; that it was\r\nan interesting chapter in literary and social history because it was\r\nnot a closed chapter, but a preliminary to the events of the present.\r\nAt the same time modest but important beginnings were being made in\r\nthe education of the actor, and men like Franklin Sargent, President of\r\nthe American Academy of Dramatic Arts, opened the way to a professional\r\ntraining for actors that would compare with the training demanded of\r\nand by the singer, painter, or sculptor. These beginnings were full\r\nof promise, but the promise was to be long held in abeyance by the\r\nmachinations of the theatrical syndicate.\r\n\r\nThis commercial trust is the heavy villain of the play, the charge\r\nagainst it being that whereas the business management of the theater\r\nwas called into being in order to serve the drama, it managed so\r\neffectively that by the winter of 1895-1896 it was strong enough to\r\ndemand that henceforth the drama support the business management.\r\nThe six men who were able to assume control handled their business\r\naccording to the approved methods of the trust, trying to get salable\r\ngoods and to multiply the output of what the public wanted, trying to\r\ncontrol all the salesmen (players) and all the distributing points\r\n(playhouses) and to put out of business any player or local manager who\r\nwould not market their choice of goods at their schedule of dates and\r\nprices. For nearly fifteen years the syndicate were as effective in\r\ntheir field as the Standard Oil or United Shoe Machinery Companies were\r\nin theirs. One actress, Mrs. Fiske, endured every sort of discomfort\r\nand, no doubt, heavy losses for the privilege of playing what, when,\r\nand where she pleased; but for a while she had her own way only to the\r\nextent of appearing in theaters so cheap that they were beneath the\r\ncontempt of the monopoly. In the meanwhile, however, discontent spread,\r\na rival firm of managers erected rival theaters, and, conducting\r\ntheir business on principles of more enlightened selfishness, in 1910\r\nenlisted twelve hundred of the smaller revolting theaters with them and\r\nforced the syndicate to share the field. Since that time the theaters\r\nof America have been administered as well, perhaps, as the system\r\nwill allow; but it is a mistaken system that puts a fine art in the\r\nmarket place and demands that it maintain itself because \"business is\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe first really great attempt to ask anything less of the modern\r\ndrama in America, to demand no more of the play than is demanded\r\nof the opera or the symphony, was the founding of the celebrated\r\nand short-lived New Theater in New York (1909-1911). That it failed\r\nwithin two years is not half so important as that it was founded, that\r\nothers on smaller scales have since been founded and have failed,\r\nthat municipal theaters have sprung up here and there and are being\r\nsupported according to various plans, that scores upon scores of little\r\ntheaters, neighborhood playhouses, and people's country theaters have\r\nbeen founded, that producers like Winthrop Ames and Stuart Walker are\r\nestablished in public favor, that the Drama League of America is a\r\ngenuine national organization, and that the printing of plays for a\r\nreading public is many fold its proportions of twenty years ago. The\r\nNapoleonic theatrical managers are still in the saddle in America, and\r\nthe commercial stage of the country is still managed from Broadway, but\r\nthe uncommercial stage is coming to be more considerable every season.\r\nThe leaven of popular intelligence is at work.\r\n\r\nWith developments of this sort taking place and gaining in momentum,\r\nthere is a growing attention to the printed literary drama and an\r\nencouraging prospect for it in the theater. As far back as 1891, when\r\nClyde Fitch and Augustus Thomas were coming into their reputations,\r\nRichard Hovey (1864-1900) published \"The Quest of Merlin,\" the first\r\nunit in his \"Launcelot and Guenevere,\" which he described as a poem in\r\ndramas. It was a splendidly conceived treatment of the conflict between\r\nthe claims of individual love and the intruding demands of the outer\r\nworld. In resorting to the Arthurian legends Hovey \"was not primarily\r\ninterested in them,\" according to his friend and expounder, Bliss\r\nCarman, \"for their historic and picturesque value as poetic material,\r\ngreat as that value undoubtedly is ... the problem he felt called upon\r\nto deal with is a perennial one, old as the world, yet intensely\r\nmodern, and it appealed to him as a modern man.... The Arthurian cycle\r\nprovided Tennyson with the groundwork of a national epic; ... to\r\nRichard Hovey it afforded a modern instance stripped of modern dress.\"\r\nIt was to have been completed in three parts, each containing a masque,\r\na tragedy, and a romantic drama; but only the first was completed--\"The\r\nQuest of Merlin\" (1891), \"The Marriage of Guenevere\" (1891), and \"The\r\nBirth of Galahad\" (1898). Shortly after finishing \"Taliesin,\" the\r\nmasque for the second part, Hovey died.\r\n\r\nAnother and greater cycle of poetic dramas which was interrupted by a\r\npremature death was a trilogy on the Promethean theme by William Vaughn\r\nMoody (1869-1910). The theme is the unity of God and man and their\r\nconsequent mutual dependency. \"The Fire-Bringer\" (1904) presents man's\r\nvictory at the supreme cost of disunion from God through the defiant\r\ntheft of fire from heaven. \"The Masque of Judgment\" (1900) is a no\r\nless fearful triumph of the Creator in dooming part of himself as he\r\noverwhelms mankind. The final part, \"The Death of Eve,\" was to have\r\nachieved the final reconciliation, but it was left a fragment at the\r\npoet's death in 1910 and so stands in the posthumous edition of his\r\nworks. It is significant in the literary history of the day that the\r\nculminating product of both these young poets was an uncompleted poetic\r\nplay-cycle. Moody's connection with the stage, however, was closer\r\nthan Hovey's, for he wrote two prose plays which were successfully\r\nproduced--\"The Great Divide\" (1907) and \"The Faith Healer\" (1909).\r\nIn \"The Great Divide,\" produced first under the title of \"The Sabine\r\nWoman,\" Moody wrote a dramatic story on a fundamental, and hence a\r\nmodern, aspect of life. The problem of the play is stated flippantly\r\nyet truly by the heroine's sister-in-law:\r\n\r\n  Here on the one hand is the primitive, the barbaric woman, falling\r\n  in love with a romantic stranger, who, like some old Viking on a\r\n  harry, cuts her with his two-handed sword from the circle of her\r\n  kinsmen, and bears her away on his dragon ship toward the midnight\r\n  sun. Here on the other hand is the derived, the civilized woman, with\r\n  a civilized nervous system, observing that the creature eats bacon\r\n  with his bowie knife, knows not the manicure, has the conversation\r\n  of a preoccupied walrus, the instincts of a jealous caribou, and the\r\n  endearments of a dancing crab in the mating season.... Ruth is one of\r\n  those people who can't live in a state of divided feeling. She sits\r\n  staring at this cleavage in her life.... All I mean is that when she\r\n  married her man she married him for keeps. And he did the same by her.\r\n\r\nThe play was produced in Chicago, put on for a long run in New York\r\nand on tour, and presented in London, and in 1917 was revived for a\r\nsuccessful run in New York again. \"The Faith Healer,\" the idea for\r\nwhich occurred to Moody in 1898, was completed ten years later, after\r\nthe success of the first play. The theme is not so close to common\r\nexperience as that of \"The Great Divide,\" and perhaps because of this\r\nas well as the subtler treatment it did not draw such audiences. Both\r\nplays end on a high spiritual level, but the second failed to register\r\nin the \"box office\" because the relief scenes are grim rather than\r\namusing and because there is no fleshly element in the love of the hero\r\nand the heroine.\r\n\r\nPercy MacKaye (1875- ) embodies the meeting of the older traditions--his\r\nfather was Steele MacKaye (see p. 439)--and the most recent development\r\nin American drama, the rise of pageantry and the civic festival. As a\r\nprofessional dramatist he has been prolific to the extent of some\r\ntwenty-five plays, pageants, and operas. His acted plays have varied in\r\nrange and subject from contemporary social satire to an interesting\r\nsuccession of echoes from the literary past--plays like \"The Canterbury\r\nPilgrims\" (1903), \"Jeanne D'Arc\" (1906), and \"Sappho and Phaon\" (1907),\r\nwhich he seems to have undertaken, in contrast to Hovey, for their\r\npicturesque and poetic value alone. His special contribution, however,\r\nhas been to the movement for an uncommercialized civic and national\r\ntheater through the preparation of a number of community celebrations.\r\nThese include the Saint Gaudens Pageant at Cornish, New Hampshire\r\n(1905), the Gloucester Pageant (1903), \"Sanctuary, a Bird Masque\"\r\n(1913), \"St. Louis, a Civic Masque\" (1914), and \"Caliban, a Community\r\nMasque\" (New York, 1916, and Boston, 1917). The fusing interest in a\r\ncommon artistic undertaking has brought together whole cities in the\r\nfinest kind of democratic enthusiasm, and the effects have not been\r\nmerely temporary, for in a community such as St. Louis the permanent\r\nbenefits are still evident in the community chorus and in the beautiful\r\ncivic theater which is the annual scene of memorable productions\r\nwitnessed by scores of thousands of spectators.\r\n\r\nCharles Rann Kennedy (1871- ), the last of the dramatists to be\r\nconsidered here, is a man in whom a technical mastery of the play is\r\ncombined with a high degree of poetic fervor. He was born in Derby,\r\nEngland, coming from a family which has been famed for classical\r\nscholarship.[39] His own education was largely pursued outside of\r\nthe schools, and he is not a university man, but no element is more\r\nimportant in his preparation for play-writing than his intimate\r\nknowledge of the classical and, especially, the Greek drama. Between\r\nthe ages of thirteen and sixteen he was office boy, clerk, and\r\ntelegraph operator, but always imaginatively interested in the\r\ntechnical aspects of his jobs. During his early twenties he was a\r\nlecturer and writer, and it is a matter of literary as well as personal\r\nmoment that in 1898 he married Edith Wynne Matthison, widely known for\r\nher work with Irving, with Tree, and at the New Theater and as the\r\ncreator of leading parts in her husband's plays. Since the beginning of\r\nhis authorship Mr. Kennedy has lived in the United States, of which he\r\nis now a citizen.\r\n\r\n  [39] In the \"Sketch Book\" Washington Irving concludes \"Rural Life\r\n       in England\" with a poem by the Reverend Rann Kennedy, A.M., a\r\n       great-uncle of the dramatist.\r\n\r\nHis dramatic work has fallen into two groups: \"The Terrible Meek\" and\r\n\"The Necessary Evil\"--Short Plays for Small Casts--and his Seven Plays\r\nfor Seven Players. As in the cases of Moody and Hovey already cited,\r\nhis plays are part of an inclusive program--a program which is the\r\nmore remarkable on account of the fact that it took definite shape in\r\nthe course of a single discussion with a group of literary friends--G.\r\nB. Shaw, Gilbert Chesterton, and Hilaire Belloc among them--before he\r\ncame to this country. As a result of this discussion he undertook to\r\nwrite seven plays: each for five men and two women, each holding the\r\nmien between a heightened and decorative romance and an objective and\r\nunimaginative realism, each dealing with a separate great central theme\r\nin life, each attempting a new or revived technical difficulty in play\r\nconstruction, and each subjected to the most rigid conformity to the\r\ndramatic unities, being written with no break in time sequence or shift\r\nof scene.\r\n\r\nThe series includes (1) \"The Winterfeast\" (1906), of which the central\r\ntheme is \"The Lie and Hate in Life which destroy\"; (2) \"The Servant\r\nin the House\" (1907), on \"The Truth and Love in Life which preserve\";\r\n(3) \"The Idol-Breaker\" (1913), on \"Freedom\"; (4) \"The Rib of the Man\"\r\n(1916), on \"The New Woman already in the World, and the New Warrior\r\ncoming as fast as the European War will let him\"; (5) \"The Army with\r\nBanners\" (1917), on \"The Coming of the Lord in Power and Glory and the\r\nNew World now culminating.\" Of these five, all but the fourth have been\r\nproduced, \"The Rib of the Man\" having been withheld temporarily because\r\nof its nonmilitant theme and the resultant managerial timidity; and all\r\nbut the fifth have been published. The series will be completed with\r\n\"The Fool from the Hills,\" the central theme being \"The Bread of Life,\r\nor The Food Problem\"; and the last will be \"The Isle of the Blest,\" on\r\n\"The Consummation of Life in what Men call Death.\"\r\n\r\nPlays written in such a progression are clearly approached in a spirit\r\nof high seriousness and with little regard or any expectation of\r\nimmediate applause. But they are also written in a spirit of high\r\ndefiance, with deliberate consciousness of the methods employed, and\r\nan inspired certainty that they will be heard at last. Adam--the\r\nIdol-Breaker--has thrown down the definite challenge:\r\n\r\n\"I've told these people things before. Many times. Why, it was me, six\r\nyears ago, as called them here, and told them of the brotherhood of\r\nman.\" [Cf. \"The Servant in the House.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Well, didn't they listen to you, that time?\" says Naomi.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, at first,\" replies Adam, \"while I was new to them. Then they\r\nturned again to idols; and twisted my plain meaning into tracts for\r\nSunday School. I up and spoke again, and told them of the lies and\r\nhate they lived by. [Cf. \"The Winterfeast.\"] Shewed them the death and\r\nbitterness of it!--Well, they soon let me know about that. I preached\r\ntheir own God's gospel to them, and brought Christ's Murder to their\r\nblood-stained doors. [Cf. \"The Terrible Meek.\"] They spat upon me.\r\nI told them of the lusts as fed their brothels; [cf. \"The Necessary\r\nEvil\"] and every red-eyed wolf among them said I lied. Even when they\r\ndidn't speak, I knew the meaning of their leering silence. This time,\r\nit's freedom--the thing they're always bragging of; and as long as I am\r\nin the world, they'll have it dinned into their heads, as freedom isn't\r\nall a matter of flags and soldiers' pop-guns. It's something they've\r\ngot to sweat for. Don't you think they're going to get off easy, once I\r\nsee them stuck in front of me!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I make them laugh, all right. They want to be amused. Lot of jaded\r\njohnnies! Every one of them thinking I mean his next-door neighbor; and\r\nI mean just him!\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Winterfeast\" there is no laughter; at most only a smile in\r\nthe first meeting of the two young lovers. It is a relentless tale\r\nof Nemesis following on the path of hatred, set in Iceland of the\r\neleventh century, told in the tone and at times plainly in the manner\r\nof Sophocles. All the others of the Seven Plays, however, are put in\r\nthe present day, with characters who are modern examples of perennial\r\ntypes, with abundant \"relief scenes\" in confirmation of Adam's \"I make\r\nthem laugh,\" and with an undertone of irony,--whimsical, derisive,\r\ngrave, or bitter, as the occasions demand. Of these \"The Servant in the\r\nHouse\" has been the preëminent popular success because of its appeal to\r\nthe conventionally religious, who accepted its pervasive beneficence\r\nand ignored its strictures on the church.\r\n\r\nNone of Mr. Kennedy's plays is more completely representative of his\r\nspirit, his purpose, and his method than \"The Rib of the Man.\" It is\r\nlocated on an island in the Ægean, amid \"the never-ending loveliness\r\nof all good Greek things.\" It is dedicated to the New Woman, to whom\r\na recently unearthed altar inscribed \"To the Mother of the Gods\" has\r\ngiven the authority of the ages. The persons of the play are morality\r\ntypes, although intensely human. They are \"David Fleming, an image of\r\nGod, the Man; Rosie Fleming, an help-meet for him, the Rib; Archie\r\nLegge, a gentleman, a Beast of the Earth; Basil Martin, an aviator, a\r\nFowl of the Air; Peter Prout, a scientist, the Subtle One; Ion, the\r\ngardener, the Voice Warning; and Diana Brand, a spare rib, the Flaming\r\nSword.\" And finally, the play is written \"with an inner and an outer\r\nmeaning, symbolical, instinct with paradox and irony, leading deeply\r\nunto truth.\"\r\n\r\nOnly one of Mr. Kennedy's plays has achieved a popular triumph, and\r\nthe success of that one was due to its limited and somewhat perverted\r\ninterpretation. They all, however, repay study and disclose new depths\r\nwith each re-reading. Serious art rarely makes quick conquests.\r\nAudiences of spirit and intellect will develop for them as they have\r\nfor the plays of Ibsen and Maeterlinck. The new audience, the new\r\ntheater, and the new drama--old as the oldest literature--in due time\r\nwill come to their own again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n=_Plays by Individual Men_=\r\n\r\n  CLYDE FITCH.

Among them it is very possible that there was a blazing\r\nof the way for another development of great importance which has taken\r\nplace without any leagues or schools or organized propaganda. This has\r\nbeen the restoration of poetry as a living language. Not only have\r\nauthors' readings taken the place of dramatic interpretations in the\r\nlecture market but the audiences who flock to hear Tagore and Noyes\r\nand Masefield and Gibson and Bynner and Lindsay and Frost go to listen\r\nto poems with which they are already familiar and to get that sense of\r\npersonal acquaintance with poets which ten years ago they coveted with\r\nplaywrights and, further back, with novelists. The dominant fact about\r\nthe contemporary reading public is its reawakened zest for poetry.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the English poetry-reading world was chiefly conscious of the\r\npassing of its leading singers for the last half century. It was a\r\nperiod when they were recalling Emerson's \"Terminus\" and Longfellow's\r\n\"Ultima Thule,\" Whitman's \"November Boughs\" and Whittier's \"A\r\nLifetime,\" Tennyson's \"Crossing the Bar\" and Browning's \"Asolando.\"\r\nThere was no group in the prime of life who were adequate successors\r\nto this greater choir. Stedman, Aldrich, and Stoddard had courted\r\nthe muse as a kind of alien divinity and enjoyed excursions into the\r\ndistant land of her dwelling-place. But their poetry was a poetry of\r\naccomplishment; an embellishment of life, and not an integral part of\r\nit (see pp. 324-326). It was a period when people were tempted with\r\nsome reason to dwell on the \"good old days,\" and for a while it seemed\r\nas though it would be long before the world would see their like again.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the times seemed to be expressed by a group of younger\r\nartists who were in conscious revolt against Victorian literature and\r\nrather noisily assertive on their favorite theme of art for art's sake.\r\nThey were occupied in composing intricate and ingenious poems. They\r\nwere engrossed like Masters's \"Petit, the Poet\" in inditing\r\n\r\n      Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus,\r\n      Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick,\r\n      Tick, tick, tick, what little iambics,\r\n      While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines!\r\n\r\nSome of them did pastels in prose, and many edited transitory little\r\nperiodicals like _The Yellow Book_, _The Chap Book_, _The Lark_,\r\nand _Truth in Boston_. Fourteen of these came into existence in the\r\nUnited States in the first two months of 1897, and almost none of them\r\nsurvived till the Fourth of July of that year. Probably the only lines\r\nin any of them recalled by the readers of to-day are Gelett Burgess's\r\nquatrain on the purple cow. The burden of these young poets was many\r\nwords fairly spoken of \"organic growth,\" \"development,\" \"progress,\"\r\n\"liberalism,\" \"freedom of speech,\" and \"independent thought\"; and the\r\nchief product of their thinking was a frank and free Bohemianism, an\r\nhonest unconventionality much more real than the diluted thing about\r\nwhich Stedman and Aldrich had rimed thirty years before.\r\n\r\nThe most vigorous and enduring of the new group was Richard Hovey\r\n(1864-1900). He was Western-born, schooled at Washington, and a\r\ngraduate of Dartmouth in 1885. His next years included study in the\r\nGeneral Theological Seminary in New York, an assistantship in a New\r\nYork ritualistic church, excursions into journalism and acting, and\r\nthen, after some years as poet and dramatist, a professorship of\r\nEnglish literature in Barnard College, Columbia University. Hovey grew\r\nperceptibly during his eager enjoyment of these various pursuits. For a\r\nwhile he seemed content to sing the praises of convivial comradeship:\r\n\r\n      For we know the world is glorious\r\n        And the goal a golden thing,\r\n      And that God is not censorious\r\n        When his children have their fling;\r\n\r\nbut he passed before long to the stage in which the good fellowship of\r\nyouth was a symbol of something far larger than itself--nothing less\r\nthan the promise of humankind. The ode delivered before his fraternity\r\nconvention in 1896 quite transcends the sort of effusion usually evoked\r\nby such occasions. The spring in the air, in the world, and in the\r\nheart of youth culminate in the oft-sung \"Stein Song\"; and after it the\r\npoem goes on to \"The first low stirring of that greater spring,\"\r\n\r\n      Of something potent burning through the earth,\r\n      Of something vital in the procreant air.\r\n\r\nThis potent something is the \"unceasing purpose\" of Tennyson, but with\r\na difference, for in Hovey's mind it is not the purpose of a detached\r\nGod who imposes his will benevolently on mankind from without, but the\r\ncreative impulse which is inherent in life itself, the evidence of the\r\ndivine spirit in the heart of man. Comradeship, then, became to Hovey\r\na symbol of altruism, and he looked beyond this springtide of the year\r\nand of the youthful collegians to the time when science, art, and\r\nreligion should emancipate men in the truth that should set them free\r\nand bring them, in spite of delays, in the fullness of time to \"the\r\ngreater to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nYet while Hovey was uplifted by the fine fervor of such a faith, he\r\nexperienced a reaction with the outbreak of the Spanish-American\r\nWar. In the sudden self-righteousness of an inflamed patriotism he\r\nnationalized God and deified war. Excited beyond measure by the\r\nimmediate issue, he not only justified America against Spain but,\r\nforgetting all the lessons of evolution, he declared that the race\r\ncould develop only through the repetition of old experiences.\r\n\r\n      By strife as well as loving--strife,\r\n      The Law of Life,--\r\n      In brute and man the climbing has been done\r\n      And shall be done hereafter. Since man was\r\n      No upward-climbing cause\r\n      Without the sword has ever yet been won.\r\n\r\nHis mistake lay in justifying all wars in order to justify the national\r\naltruism of the war with Spain, and his fallacy came in his assumption\r\nthat biological and physical life were governed by the same laws. For\r\nthe moment Hovey turned \"jingo,\" as most of his countrymen did, yet\r\neven then he invoked the sword for the suppression of tyranny and not\r\nin the name of nationalistic ambition.\r\n\r\nThe home of Hovey's imagination was where the true poet's always\r\nis--\"far in the vast of sky, ... too high for sound of strife, or\r\nany violation of the town.\" From this high vantage point he sang\r\nthe glories of the things he loved the best, but with maturity he\r\nmoved from the world of material pleasure to the realms of spiritual\r\nadventure. In 1893 he wrote\r\n\r\n      Down the world with Marna!\r\n      That's the life for me!\r\n      Wandering with the wandering wind,\r\n      Vagabond and unconfined!\r\n\r\nFive years later he could no longer catalogue his places on the map,\r\nfor his goal was \"the unknown\" and \"the wilderness\" in pursuit of the\r\nhigh human adventure which Moody was to celebrate in his \"Road Hymn for\r\nthe Start.\" In a parallel way Hovey's first conception of fellowship\r\nrose from the early relish for beer and song to the fellowship of\r\nkindred souls of which the fine flowering is the love of man and woman.\r\n\r\n      Spirit to spirit finds its voiceless way,\r\n      As tone melts meeting in accordant tone,--\r\n      Oh, then our souls, far in the vast of sky,\r\n        Look from a tower, too high for sound of strife\r\n        Or any violation of the town,\r\n      Where the great vacant winds of God go by,\r\n        And over the huge misshapen city of life\r\n        Love pours his silence and his moonlight down.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirty-six, just on the threshold of maturity, Hovey died.\r\n\r\nWilliam Vaughn Moody (1869-1910) was another son of the Middle West.\r\nBorn in southern Indiana, he lost his mother in his fifteenth year and\r\nhis father, a river-steamboat captain, in his seventeenth. By alternate\r\nstudy and teaching he prepared himself for Harvard, and entering at\r\nsomewhat more than the average age he completed his college work in\r\nthree years and followed these with a year in Europe as private tutor.\r\nIn addition to a receptiveness for learning he had the capacity for a\r\nrich and varied culture which is sometimes mistakenly thought to belong\r\nonly to blue-blooded inheritors of family tradition. From the close\r\nof his residence in Cambridge till his death, seventeen years later,\r\nMoody's life included long and extended travels, varied and profound\r\nstudy, eight years' teaching at the University of Chicago, from\r\nwhich President Harper was reluctant to accept his resignation, and\r\ndistinguished work as painter, poet, and dramatist. Suddenly stricken\r\nwith a fatal illness, he died in 1910.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of his work as playwright (see pp. 445,\r\n446). His lyric and narrative poems all have the same breadth of view\r\nwhich is inherent in his poetic dramas. He was familiar with a wide\r\nrange of the world's art and literature, but in the work which he chose\r\nto collect for republication he was imitative of none. His imagination\r\nroved freely through all time and space. \"Gloucester Moors\" were the\r\nvantage point from which he conceived the earth as a \"vast, outbound\r\nship of souls\"; \"Old Pourquoi\" challenged the scheme of creation\r\nfrom beneath the Norman sky; \"The Death of Eve\" is derived from the\r\nHebrew past, \"The Masque of Judgment\" from the Greek, \"A Dialogue\r\nin Purgatory\" from the Italian, \"The Fountain\" from early American\r\nlegend, \"On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines\" from a current event.\r\nThus he did not maintain his citizenship of the world by any denial\r\nof allegiance to America. In the third section of \"An Ode in Time of\r\nHesitation\" he sketched as splendid a pageant of America as has ever\r\nbeen devised. The Cape Ann children seeking the arbutus, the hill lads\r\nof Tennessee harking to the wild geese on their northern flight, are\r\none with the youth of Chicago, the renewing green of the wheat fields,\r\nthe unrolling of the rivers from the white Sierras, the downward creep\r\nof Alaskan glaciers, and the perennial palm-crown of Hawaii. It is in\r\nvery truth\r\n\r\n            the eagle nation Milton saw,\r\n          Mewing its mighty youth.\r\n\r\nMoody's love of America did not lead him to embrace the \"manifest\r\ndestiny\" illusion. He was quite as conscious of the misdirection of\r\nhuman leadership as he was of the riches with which God had endowed\r\nthe natural land. \"Gloucester Moors\" is deeply solicitous for a future\r\nwhich seems to be insured for the grasping capitalist; \"The Brute\" is\r\nboth more vigorous and more hopeful in its certitude that the factory\r\nsystem in its worst forms is a short-lived social abortion. The demon\r\nof the machine is sure to be caught and subdued:\r\n\r\n  He must give each man his portion, each his pride and worthy place;\r\n  He must batter down the arrogant and lift the weary face.\r\n  On each vile mouth set purity, on each low forehead grace.\r\n\r\nThese poems were of life within America or without it, but in \"An Ode\r\nin Time of Hesitation\" and \"On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines\"\r\nMoody warned the rulers in Washington that the country, now awake to\r\nits duties in the world, would forgive blindness, but baseness it would\r\nsmite. Finally, in \"The Quarry\" he cried out in pride at America's fine\r\npart in preventing the partitioning of helpless China by the grasping\r\nEuropean empires,--the achievement of the poet-diplomat, John Hay.\r\n\r\nThroughout all Moody's work is a constant undercurrent of evolutionary\r\nthought--not the brutal mechanism associated with the term \"Darwinism,\"\r\nbut the aspiring impulse within all life which makes it rise not\r\nthrough struggle against outer forces so much as through the innate\r\nimpulse to develop. In the sardonic \"Menagerie\" the idea is ironically\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n      Survival of the fittest, adaptation,\r\n      And all their other evolution terms,\r\n      Seem to omit one small consideration,\r\n\r\nwhich is no less than the existence of souls:\r\n\r\n      Restless, plagued, impatient things,\r\n      All dream and unaccountable desire;\r\n\r\nand these souls are expressions of the universal soul which finds\r\nits own salvation in unceasing \"groping, testing, passing on,\"--the\r\ncreative struggle described by Raphael in \"The Masque of Judgment\" as\r\n\r\n      The strife of ripening suns and withering moons,\r\n      Marching of ice-floes, and the nameless wars\r\n      Of monster races laboring to be man.\r\n\r\nIn his attitude toward and his literary treatment of woman Moody was\r\nemphatically modern. He was far beyond the supercilious and hollow\r\namenities with which eighteenth-century poetry was filled, and he\r\nwas not satisfied with the sincerer expression of deep personal\r\ntributes to individual women. In his philosophy woman was the dominant\r\ninfluence in the development of humankind. Eve and Prometheus were one\r\nin seeking the knowledge and power to lift man above brute creation\r\nand in producing the clash between God and man which was the price\r\nof knowledge and the cost of progress. But Prometheus was a poor and\r\ndefeated character in comparison; for Moody, in Eve and Pandora,\r\npresented woman not only as the donor and the fulfillment of love but\r\nas the final agent of reconciliation between the human and the divine.\r\nIn the various poems there are acknowledgments of awe, of reverence,\r\nof spiritual love, and of passion; taken together they show the same\r\nbreadth of view that belongs to the human equation in which Moody\r\nregards woman as the greatest factor. It is most significant that the\r\ndramatic trilogy was planned to conclude with a song of Eve, and that\r\ntwice--in \"I am the Woman\" and part five of \"The Death of Eve\"--Moody\r\ncomposed studies toward that final song that was never perfected.\r\nBoth progress through the ages when woman was subtly molded by man's\r\nconception of her, so that her happiness and her very being consisted\r\nin conforming herself to him.\r\n\r\n      Still, still with prayer and ecstasy she strove\r\n      To be the woman they did well approve,\r\n      That narrowed to their love,\r\n      She might have done with bitterness and blame.\r\n\r\nAnd in both she appears as the indomitable Promethean spirit who in the\r\nend was to fulfill that plan which in the beginning she had endangered.\r\nThere is no reference to any woman in any of Moody's poems which is out\r\nof harmony with this dominating and progressive idea.\r\n\r\nFor several reasons Moody's poetry is not easy to read and is therefore\r\nundestined to wide popularity (see pp. 263, 264). He was not interested\r\nto compose simple lyrics or narratives. Seldom does he aid the reader\r\nby means of even an implied narrative thread. The poems inspired by\r\nhistory are not self-explanatory nor accompanied by footnotes. Moody\r\nconsistently employed events, whether actual or imagined, as mere\r\navenues of approach to emotional and spiritual experiences, and he\r\nexpected the reader to contribute to the poems from his own resourceful\r\nimagination. It is because the whole meaning is not laid out on the\r\nsurface of his verses--like Christmas-card sentiments--that Moody\r\nhas become very largely a poet's poet. Their instinctive grasp of\r\nthe figurative deeper meanings, their immediate response to elusive\r\nmetaphor, and their understanding of his vigorous, exact, but sometimes\r\nrecondite diction make them his best audience. For they too can most\r\nnearly appreciate the distinguished beauties of his work--his wide and\r\nintimate knowledge of world literature, the opulence of his style, the\r\nfirmness of his structure, the scrupulousness of his detail. Through\r\nthe rising and the risen poets of the present generation Moody's\r\ninfluence is exerted on thousands who are all unconscious of it.\r\n\r\nAn approach to contemporary American poetry in a fraction of a chapter\r\nat the end of a general history can be justified on only one ground:\r\nit serves the purpose of a guideboard on a transcontinental highway.\r\nAmerican literature was not concluded with the deaths of the great New\r\nEngland group nor has it come to an end since then. The student should\r\nrecognize this in his respect for the fine promise of what is now being\r\nwritten, and he should recognize that the study of our past literature\r\ncan bear no richer fruit than a sane understanding of the literature\r\nof the day. Furthermore he should be intelligent enough to see that\r\nliterature need not be old to be fit for study--that it is not only\r\nabsurd but vicious to assume (as used to be said, with a difference, of\r\nthe Indian) that there is no good poet but a dead poet. These few pages\r\nare therefore devoted to a half-dozen writers who represent tendencies.\r\nThey are arbitrarily selected as the contemporary dramatists in the\r\npreceding chapter were. Yet their weight is greatly reënforced by the\r\nmany others to whom no allusion can be made. A comparison of the three\r\nbooks on recent American poetry suggests the speed of the literary\r\ncurrent. Miss Rittenhouse's \"The Younger American Poets\" (1904)\r\nincludes eighteen poets of whom thirteen were born before 1865. Miss\r\nLowell's \"Tendencies in Modern American Poetry\" (1917) includes six\r\npoets, none of whom were mentioned in the earlier book, and the oldest\r\nof whom was born in the closing days of 1869. Of the sixteen poets\r\nindicated by name in the chapter headings of Mr. Louis Untermeyer's\r\n\"New Era in American Poetry\" (1919), only three were born before 1875.\r\n\r\nThe reading of contemporary poetry should be done with zest and without\r\ncalculation, but the study of the same material must be approached with\r\nself-conscious deliberateness and with a definite resolve not to be\r\ncarried away by the cheap and easy generalizations current on the lips\r\nof the careless talker. Contemporary poetry is not all of one kind nor\r\nis it chiefly characterized by defiant revolt against old forms and\r\nold ideas. It is true that in all branches of artistic endeavor new\r\nmethods and new points of view are being advanced. In music Debussy and\r\nSchoenberg, in painting Cézanne and Matisse, in sculpture Rodin and\r\nhis disciples, in stage setting and costuming Gordon Craig and Leon\r\nBakst, have shocked and surprised quite as many as they have edified,\r\nand have given rise to the same sort of querulous protest indulged in\r\nby those who talk as if all modern poetry were typified by the most\r\nextravagant verses of Alfred Kreymborg, or \"Anne Knish.\" But in poetry\r\nmost of the recent work has not been wantonly bizarre, most of the\r\nmore distinguished verse has not been \"free,\" and most of the men and\r\nwomen who have written free verse have shown and have practiced a firm\r\nmastery of the established forms. The point, then, is to maintain an\r\nopen mind and to make sure of conclusions before adopting them, and\r\nthe surest method of doing these two student-like things is to read\r\nand study authors by the bookful and not by the pseudo-royal road of\r\nanthologies and eclectic magazines. If you want to become acquainted\r\nwith a man you will sit down at leisure with him in his study, instead\r\nof forming snapshot judgments from contact at afternoon teas, and\r\nyou will form your own opinion in preference to gleaning it from the\r\nconversation of others.\r\n\r\nEdwin Arlington Robinson (1869- ), the oldest of this latter group,\r\nwas born in the same year with Moody and is now in the prime of\r\nlife. The Tilbury of many of his poems is really the town of his\r\nupbringing--Gardiner, Maine. It is an unusual but not a unique village\r\nin America--a colonial old-world village. The atmosphere of Puritanism\r\nhad not been blown away from it, and it still felt the subtle influence\r\nof a preëminent family. When \"the squire\" passed,\r\n\r\n      We people on the pavement looked at him;\r\n      He was a gentleman from sole to crown,\r\n      Clean-favored, and imperially slim.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to think of Tilbury as an English town; it is utterly\r\ndifferent from Lindsay's Springfield or Masters's Spoon River. It is\r\nnot without significance that the clearest single picture presents a\r\nlittle boy of twelve as the companion of \"Isaac and Archibald,\" two old\r\nmen on the ominous verge of superannuation. It was life in Gardiner\r\nthat gives so real a sense of the town on the Avon in \"Ben Jonson\r\nEntertains a Man from Stratford.\" In 1891 Mr. Robinson entered Harvard,\r\nwithdrawing at the end of two years and entering business in New York\r\nCity. Here he remained till 1910, the last five years as an appointee\r\nof President Roosevelt in the New York Customhouse, and since the\r\nlatter date he has lived again in Gardiner, bearing some resemblance\r\nin his mellowed maturity, perhaps, to Larry Scammon in his play \"The\r\nPorcupine.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of literary history the most striking fact about Mr.\r\nRobinson is that the poetry-reading public has been redeveloped since\r\nhe began to write. Although his first volume, \"The Children of the\r\nNight,\" appeared in 1897, and his second, \"Captain Craig,\" in 1902, it\r\nwas possible for him to be omitted from \"The Younger American Poets\" of\r\n1904. With \"The Town down the River\" in 1910 his recognition began to\r\ncome, and with the republication of \"Captain Craig\" the public became\r\naware of a volume which they could have been reading for full thirteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMiss Lowell displays a mild contempt for the title poem of this book,\r\nand Mr. Phelps--in his \"Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth\r\nCentury\"--echoes her verdict. Yet for many readers there is a splendor\r\nin it and a richness that brings them back to it again and again.\r\nIt is doubtless long, discursive, and condensible. In fact it is\r\nalready condensed in such a bit as \"Flammonde.\" It is an elaboration\r\nof the title lyric for \"The Children of the Night\"; but only a wanton\r\nperversion of criticism will discount a philosophical poem for not\r\nsubmitting to lyric standards. It is a poem of childhood, sunlight,\r\nlaughter, and hope declaimed by an indomitable old vagabond of eternity\r\nwho is invincible in death and is fittingly borne to the grave while\r\nthe trombones of the Tilbury band blare the Dead March in \"Saul.\"\r\nCaptain Craig is a character who would not be his complete self\r\nwithout his verbosity. His type, in fact, is never succinct. They are\r\nextravagant of time, of gesture, of vocal and rhetorical emphasis, of\r\nwords themselves. Out of the abundance of their hearts their mouths\r\nspeak all sorts of irresponsible, whimsical, exalted, and splendid\r\nextravagance. They give voice to the dumb, and they amuse and stimulate\r\nthe good listeners, but they bore the cleverly communicative, who\r\ndislike any consecutive talk but their own. Thus, for example, the\r\ncaptain writes on one May day:\r\n\r\n                             I have yearned\r\n      In many another season for these days,\r\n      And having them with God's own pageantry\r\n      To make me glad for them,--yes, I have cursed\r\n      The sunlight and the breezes and the leaves\r\n      To think of men on stretchers and on beds,\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Or of women working where a man would fall--\r\n      Flat-breasted miracles of cheerfulness\r\n      Made neuter by the work that no man counts\r\n      Until it waits undone; children thrown\r\n      To feed their veins and souls with offal....\r\n        Yes,\r\n      I have had half a mind to blow my brains out\r\n      Sometimes; and I have gone from door to door\r\n      Ragged myself, trying to do something--\r\n      Crazy, I hope.--But what has this to do\r\n      With Spring? Because one half of humankind\r\n      Lives here in hell, shall not the other half\r\n      Do any more than just for conscience' sake\r\n      Be miserable? Is this the way for us\r\n      To lead these creatures up to find the light,\r\n      Or the way to be drawn down to find the dark\r\n      Again?\r\n\r\nCaptain Craig, in a word, is self-expression in very being and condemns\r\nin joyous scorn the man who believes that life is best fulfilled\r\nthrough discipline and renunciation. Instead he offers something\r\npositive:\r\n\r\n                             Take on yourself\r\n      But your sincerity, and you take on\r\n      Good promise for all climbing; fly for truth,\r\n      And hell shall have no storm to crush your flight,\r\n      No laughter to vex down your loyalty.\r\n\r\nThis is the note throughout all Robinson's poems and plays. His\r\ndisbelief in negativism leads him often to be impatient and caustic\r\nand leads the cloudy minded to timid deprecation of his cynicism,\r\nnot knowing the difference between this and irony; but Mr. Robinson\r\nis never cynical toward the things that are more excellent. He is\r\nonly convinced that people's Puritan convictions as to what is more\r\nexcellent result in a perverted estimate; he is only attempting to\r\nsubstitute light for shadow, laughter for gloom; he is only saying with\r\nLarry Scammon:\r\n\r\n  \"Stop me if I am too cheerful; but at the same time, if I can instil\r\n  the fertile essence of Hope into this happy household, for God's\r\n  sake, let me do it.... You had far better--all of you--begin to\r\n  get yourselves out of your own light, and cease to torment your\r\n  long-bedevilled heads with the dark doings of bogies that have no\r\n  real existence.\"\r\n\r\nAs a craftsman Mr. Robinson has won distinction by his simple, direct\r\nrealism. He employs for the most part the old iambic measures, a\r\nsentence structure which is often conversational, and a diction which\r\nis severe in its restraint. There are few \"purple patches\" in his\r\npoetry, but there are many clear flashes of incisive phrasing. His work\r\nis like a May day in his own seacoast town--not balmy, but bracing,\r\nwith lots of sparkle on the blue, and the taste of the east wind\r\nthrough it all.\r\n\r\nRobert Frost (1875- ) is known as the author of three books of verse:\r\n\"A Boy's Will,\" 1913, \"North of Boston,\" 1914, and \"Mountain Interval,\"\r\n1916. He is known also--and rightly--as the voice and embodiment of\r\nrural New England. Yet he was born in San Francisco, his mother was\r\nborn in Edinburgh, he first came to New England at the age of ten, and\r\nhe lived for the next eight schoolboy years in a mill town, Lawrence,\r\nMassachusetts. Nevertheless, in his capacity for receiving impressions,\r\nhe seemed to have a selective memory which made him sensitive to the\r\naspects of country life in the regions north of Boston--the regions\r\ntrod by nine generations of forbears on his father's side of the\r\nfamily. And so it was that though his first two volumes were published\r\nin London, there is no local trace of the old country in them, nothing\r\nin them that he had not known in farm or village between 1885 and 1912,\r\nwhen he set sail with his wife and children toward a residence of two\r\nand a half years in England. On his return to America he bought a farm\r\nin New Hampshire. Since 1916 he has taught in Amherst College.\r\n\r\nThe common statement that Mr. Frost is content solely to present the\r\nappearances of New England life should be given distinct qualifications\r\nin two respects: the first is that his earliest book, \"A Boy's Will,\"\r\nis wholly subjective and analytical, completely falling outside the\r\ngeneralization. And the second is that while \"North of Boston\" and\r\n\"Mountain Interval\" are objective pictures of New England life, the\r\ntruth in them is by no means limited to New England, but is pertinent\r\nto human kind, although deeply tinged with the hue of that particular\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\"A Boy's Will,\" a little volume, is made up of thirty-two lyrics,\r\neach of them complete and most of them lovely. They are not, however,\r\ndetached, although it is an open question how many readers would\r\nsee their relationship if this were not indicated in the table of\r\ncontents. It is the record of a young artist's experience who marries,\r\nwithdraws to the country, revels in the isolation of winter, in the\r\ncoming of spring, and in the farm beauties of summer. This isolation,\r\nhowever, cannot satisfy him long. Let the contents for Part Two show\r\nwhat happens: \"'Revelation'--He resolves to become intelligible,\r\nat least to himself, since there is no help else--'The Trial by\r\nExistence'--and to know definitely what he thinks about the soul; 'In\r\nEqual Sacrifice'--about love; 'The Tuft of Flowers'--about fellowship;\r\n'Spoils of the Dead'--about death; 'Pan with Us'--about art (his own);\r\n'The Demiurge's Laugh'--about science.\" With the five lyrics of Part\r\nThree, the youth and his bride return to the world with misgivings:\r\n\r\n          Out through the fields and the woods\r\n            And over the walls I have wended;\r\n          I have climbed the hills of view\r\n            And looked at the world, and descended;\r\n          I have come by the highway home,\r\n            And lo, it is ended.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          Ah, when to the heart of man\r\n            Was it ever less than a treason\r\n          To go with the drift of things,\r\n            To yield with a grace to reason,\r\n          And bow and accept the end\r\n            Of a love or a season?\r\n\r\nThis book does not represent the work of Frost as it appears in his\r\nlater volumes, but it does represent the poet himself:\r\n\r\n          A lover of the meadows and the woods,\r\n          And mountains; and of all that we behold\r\n          From this green earth.\r\n\r\nThe second volume, \"North of Boston,\" is twice as long as \"A Boy's\r\nWill\" and contains half as many titles. There would be nothing in this\r\nmathematical formula if it did not carry with it a real difference\r\nin content. But this second book is made up not of lyrics, but of\r\nunimpassioned vignettes of New England life. This is the grim New\r\nEngland which the poet attempted to shut out in \"Love and a Question\":\r\n\r\n      But whether or not a man was asked,\r\n        To mar the love of two\r\n      By harboring woe in the bridal house,\r\n        The bridegroom wished he knew.\r\n\r\nThe book presents the death of a farm laborer, the maddened bereavement\r\nof a mother whose child is buried within sight of the house, the black\r\nprospect faced by a household drudge who faces the insanity which is\r\nan inherited blight in her blood. They are not amiable pictures, and\r\nthey offer neither problem nor solution, only the life itself. They\r\nare not, however, all equally grim. \"The Mountain\" tells of a township\r\nof sixty voters with only a fringe of level land around the looming\r\npile. It dominates life, limits it, and rises above it, for few have\r\neither time or curiosity to reach the top. \"The Black Cottage\" presents\r\na widowed relict of the Civil War who knew only her sacrifice and\r\nwhose unthinking orthodoxy was as hazy as her political creed. With\r\nliberalism in the parish, the preacher was inclined to omit \"descended\r\ninto Hades\" from the ritual:\r\n\r\n      ... We could drop them\r\n      Only--there was the bonnet in the pew,\r\n      Such a phrase couldn't have meant much to her.\r\n      But suppose she had missed it from the Creed\r\n      As a child misses the unsaid Good-night,\r\n      And falls asleep with heartache--how should I feel?\r\n\r\nOf another sort are the poems which have most of outdoor in them:\r\n\"Mending Wall,\" the symbol of barriers between properties which the\r\nwinters throw down; \"Blueberries,\" which indicates the complex of\r\nownership in a countryside filled with nature's gifts of uncultivated\r\nfruit; \"After Apple Picking,\" the weariness forced upon the farmer\r\nin his effort to husband an embarrassment of orchard riches; and\r\n\"The Woodpile\" with its suggestion of the slow processes of nature\r\ncontrasted with the temporal efforts of man. The woodpile is discovered\r\nfar out in a swamp, long abandoned and vine-covered:\r\n\r\n      ... I thought that only\r\n      Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\r\n      Could so forget his handiwork on which\r\n      He spent himself, the labour of his axe,\r\n      And leave it there far from a useful fireplace\r\n      To warm the frozen swamp as best it could\r\n      With the slow smokeless burning of decay.\r\n\r\nThe last volume, \"Mountain Interval,\" is something of a composite,\r\nwith elements in both the former two. One reads Mr. Frost's pages\r\nthoughtfully and leaves them in a thoughtful mood. Not all are grim,\r\nbut very few are gay. They have the rock-ribbed austerity of the\r\ncountry from which they spring and some of its beauty, too. They are\r\nsuffused with the smoky haze of an Indian-summer day.\r\n\r\nEdgar Lee Masters (1869- ) was born in Kansas in the same year with\r\nMoody and Robinson. In the next year his family moved to Illinois,\r\nwhich is his real \"native\" state. As a boy he had wide opportunities\r\nfor reading. At the age of twenty-one he entered Knox College and\r\nplunged with zest into the study of the classics, but was forced\r\nto withdraw at the end of the year because Mr. Masters, Sr., would\r\nacknowledge no value in these studies for the practice of law,\r\ntoward which he was directing his son. After a brief experiment in\r\nindependence the young man surrendered and eventually entered on a\r\nsuccessful career as a Chicago attorney. Yet the law did not take\r\ncomplete possession of him; he has always been a devoted reader of\r\nGreek literature. \"Songs and Satires,\" published in 1916, contains\r\na few lyrics from a volume of 1898 which was printed, but through\r\nan accident of the trade never published. One of these ends with the\r\nsignificant stanza:\r\n\r\n      Helen of Troy, Greek art\r\n      Hath made our heart thy heart,\r\n        Thy love our love.\r\n      For poesy, like thee,\r\n      Must fly and wander free\r\n        As the wild dove.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters's next venture was a poetic drama in 1900, \"Maximilian,\" a\r\ntragedy in verse which was accorded a few sympathetic reviews but no\r\nwide reading. Other works followed in the next fifteen years, some in\r\nlaw and some in literature. And finally, in 1915, appeared the \"Spoon\r\nRiver Anthology.\" This is in all probability the most widely circulated\r\nbook of new poems in the history of American literature; others may\r\nhave achieved a greater total of copies during a long career, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether any others have equaled fifty thousand within three\r\nyears of publication.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable single utterance on this much-discussed work is the\r\nrichly compacted preface of Mr. Masters in \"Toward the Gulf,\" with its\r\ninscription to William Marion Reedy. Mr. Masters had submitted various\r\ncontributions to Reedy's _Mirror_, but had received most of them back\r\nwith friendly appeals for something fresh. The first five Spoon River\r\nepitaphs were written almost casually in answer to this repeated\r\nchallenge. At the same time they were a more than casual application\r\nof a hint from the Greek: a \"resuscitation of the Greek epigrams,\r\nironical and tender, satirical and sympathetic,\" assembled into an\r\nultimate collection of nearly two hundred and fifty brief units, each\r\na self-inscribed epitaph by one of the Spoon River townsfolk. These\r\nrepresent the chief types in an American country town and recognize in\r\nparticular the usual line of cleavage between those who choose to be\r\nconsidered virtuous and those who do not care what they are considered.\r\nUnfortunately the first of these classes includes both the idealist\r\nand the hypocrite; and the second, both the conscious radical and\r\nthe confirmed reprobate. A typical issue which might arise in such a\r\ntown, as well as a typical alignment of forces, is described in \"The\r\nSpooniad,\" the closing mock-heroic fragment and the longest unit in the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThe \"Anthology\" has been violently assailed as a wantonly cynical\r\nproduction, each assault on this ground carrying within itself a\r\nproof that the censor either had not read the book through or did not\r\nunderstand it. As a matter of fact the most impressive element in the\r\nbook and the one which bulks largest in the last quarter of it are the\r\nvictorious idealists. There is Davis Matlock, who decided to live life\r\nout like a god, sure of immortality. There is Tennessee Claflin Shope,\r\nwho asserted the sovereignty of his own soul, and Samuel Gardiner,\r\nwho determined to live largely in token of his ample spirit, and the\r\nVillage Atheist, who knew that only those who strive mightily could\r\npossess eternal life, and Lydia Humphrey, who in her church found the\r\nvision of the poets. In spite of the protests of readers who were so\r\ndisgusted with the Inferno of the earlier portion that they never\r\nprogressed to the concluding Paradiso, the book achieved its great\r\ncirculation among a tolerant public and enviable applause from the most\r\ndiscriminating critics.\r\n\r\n\"Spoon River\" established Mr. Masters's reputation and prepared the\r\npublic for further thrills and shocks in the volumes to follow. This\r\nexpectation has been only half fulfilled. The certainty of a public\r\nhearing has naturally encouraged the poet to more rapid production, but\r\nthe subsequent books--\"Songs and Satires\" and \"The Great Valley\" of\r\n1916 and \"Toward the Gulf\" of 1918--have been divided both in tone and\r\ncontent between the caustic informality for which Mr. Masters was known\r\nin his earlier work and the classic finish which is a return to his\r\nunknown, earliest style.\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of sex, however, Mr. Masters has supplied the shocks\r\nand thrills expected, dealing with various aspects of passion with\r\na frank minuteness which is sometimes distasteful and sometimes\r\nmorbid. Unusually his discussions of passion are more analytical than\r\npicturesque. He assumes its existence as a dominant factor in life\r\nand discusses not the experience itself so much as its influence.\r\nFrequently whole poems are concerned with it. He takes for granted\r\npassionate love without benefit of clergy, recording it without either\r\nidealizing it or defending it. Doubtless life has included the material\r\nfor the \"Dialogue at Perko's,\" for \"Victor Rafolski on Art,\" and for\r\n\"Widow La Rue,\" and certainly modern poetry supplies parallels in the\r\nworks of other men. In a more significant way the sex psychology of\r\nFreud crops out in many poems not ostensibly devoted to it, as, for\r\nexample, in \"To-morrow is my Birthday.\" This soliloquy attributed to\r\nShakespeare in his tercentenary year stands in striking contrast to Mr.\r\nRobinson's \"Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford.\" In these two\r\npoems (of about four hundred lines each) Mr. Robinson writes in the\r\nmanner of Ben Jonson, paying his tribute to Shakespeare at the height\r\nof his powers in London, touching on his susceptibility to women but\r\npassing this to dilate on his almost superhuman wisdom; Mr. Masters\r\ndevotes the last two thirds of Shakespeare's monologue on the night of\r\nhis last carousal to sex confessions which become increasingly gross as\r\nthe bard becomes increasingly drunk. Mr. Robinson's passage is only a\r\nfew lines in length and concludes:\r\n\r\n      There's no long cry for going into it,\r\n      However, and we don't know much about it.\r\n\r\nMr. Masters's approaches two hundred and fifty lines, begins with \"The\r\nthing is sex,\" continues with\r\n\r\n      Give me a woman, Ben, and I will pick\r\n      Out of this April, by this larger art\r\n      Of fifty-two, such songs as we have heard,\r\n      Both you and I, when weltering in the clouds\r\n      Of that eternity which comes in sleep,\r\n      Or in the viewless spinning of the soul\r\n      When most intense,\r\n\r\nand ends with common brothel profanity. The popular method of\r\njustifying the Masters treatment is to gibe at the Robinson reticence\r\nas Puritan prudishness, but it is a gibe which for many enforces the\r\nvalue of reticence even in modern art.\r\n\r\nSo much for the negative side of Mr. Masters's work--the so-called\r\ncynicism declaimed at by the inattentive reader and the preoccupation\r\nwith sex which is fairly open to criticism. On the positive side the\r\ngreater weight of his work lies in poems of searching analysis. \"So\r\nWe Grew Together\" is the changing relations of an adopted son for\r\nhis Bohemian father; \"Excluded Middle,\" an inquiry into the mystery\r\nof inheritance; \"Dr. Scudder's Clinical Lecture,\" the study of a\r\nparanoiac--dramatic monologues suggestive of Browning in execution\r\nas well as content. The reader of Mr. Masters as a whole is bound to\r\ndiscover in the end that all these analyses are searchings into the\r\nmystery of life. It appears in \"The Loom\" as it does in \"The Cry\":\r\n\r\n      There's a voice in my heart that cries and cries for tears.\r\n      It is not a voice, but a pain of many years.\r\n      It is not a pain, but the rune of far-off spheres.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Deep in darkness the bulb under mould and clod\r\n      Feels the sun in the sky and pushes above the sod;\r\n      Perhaps this cry in my heart is nothing but God!\r\n\r\nAnd he is bound to confess that Mr. Masters, instead of being a cynic,\r\nis a sober optimist. Take the last lines of the opening and closing\r\npoems in \"Toward the Gulf\":\r\n\r\n      And forever as long as the river flows toward the Gulf\r\n      Ulysses reincarnate shall come\r\n      To guard our places of sleep,\r\n      Till East and West shall be one in the west of heaven and earth!\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          \"And after that?\"\r\n          \"Another spring--that's all I know myself,\r\n          There shall be springs and springs!\"\r\n\r\nNicholas Vachel Lindsay (1879- ), born in Springfield, Illinois, of\r\nwhich he is the most devoted and distinguished citizen since Lincoln,\r\nstudied for three years at Hiram College and then for five years as\r\nan art student in Chicago and New York. Unfortunately his drawings\r\nare accessible only in a quarto pamphlet--\"A Letter to Program\r\nManagers\"--which is not for sale. They show the same vigor and the same\r\nantic play of fancy inherent in his verse. In 1906 he took his first\r\nlong tramp through Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, and in 1908 a\r\nsecond through the northeastern states. During these two, as in his\r\nlatest like excursion through the Western wheat belt, he traveled as a\r\nminstrel, observing the following rules:\r\n\r\n(1) Keep away from the cities.\r\n\r\n(2) Keep away from the railroads.\r\n\r\n(3) Have nothing to do with money. Carry no baggage.\r\n\r\n(4) Ask for dinner about quarter after eleven.\r\n\r\n(5) Ask for supper, lodging and breakfast about quarter of five.\r\n\r\n(6) Travel alone.\r\n\r\n(7) Be neat, truthful, civil and on the square.\r\n\r\n(8) Preach the Gospel of Beauty.\r\n\r\nThese appeared at the head of a little pamphlet entitled \"Rhymes to\r\nbe Traded for Bread,\" the only baggage he carried besides a further\r\nprinted statement called \"The Gospel of Beauty.\" In smiling defense\r\nof his course Mr. Lindsay has said that up to date there has been no\r\nestablished method for implanting beauty in the heart of the average\r\nAmerican. \"_Until such a way has been determined upon by a competent\r\ncommittee_, I must be pardoned for taking my own course and trying\r\nany experiment I please.\" Mr. Lindsay has not limited himself to this\r\nway of circulating his ideas. He has posted his poems on billboards,\r\nrecited them from soap boxes and on the vaudeville stage, and has\r\neven descended to select club audiences. He has, however, not allowed\r\nthe calls of the lyceum managers to convert him from a poet to an\r\nentertainer.\r\n\r\nHis books have been six in number and, according to his own advice,\r\nare to be read in the following order: \"A Handy Guide for Beggars,\"\r\n\"Adventures while Preaching the Gospel of Beauty,\" \"The Art of the\r\nMoving Picture,\" \"General William Booth Enters into Heaven,\" \"The\r\nCongo,\" and \"The Chinese Nightingale.\" The first three are prose\r\nstatements of his social and religious philosophy; the second three\r\nare poems. His seventh volume is announced as \"The Golden Book of\r\nSpringfield.\" In its title it is a reaffirmation of what appears in\r\nmany of his poems and of what he stated in \"The Gospel of Beauty\"\r\n(1912): \"The things most worth while are one's own hearth and\r\nneighborhood. We should make our own home and neighborhood the most\r\ndemocratic, the most beautiful, and the holiest in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe obvious first point about the poetry of Mr. Lindsay is that in it\r\nhe lives up to his own instructions. He keeps quite as close to his own\r\ndistrict as Mr. Masters and Mr. Frost do and he indulges in as wide a\r\nplay of imagination as does Mr. Robinson. In the rôle of an apostle\r\nhe tries to implant beauty in the heart of the average American. Yet\r\n\"implant\" is not the proper word; his own word is \"establish,\" for he\r\nre-enforces a latent sense of beauty in hearts that are unconscious of\r\nit and he reveals it in the lives of those whom the average American\r\noverlooks or despises. On the one hand, he carries whole audiences into\r\nan actual participation in his recitals and, on the other, he discloses\r\nthe \"scum of the earth\" as poets and mystics.\r\n\r\nThus \"General William Booth Enters into Heaven\" tells of Booth's\r\napotheosis as it is seen and felt by a Salvation Army sympathizer.\r\nBooth with his big bass drum, followed by a motley slum crowd, leads to\r\nthe most impressively magnificent place within the ken of a small-town\r\nMiddle Westerner. This is an Illinois courthouse square. As a matter of\r\nfact, it is bleak, treeless, dust-blown, mud-moated--the dome of the\r\ncourthouse in the middle, flanked on all sides with ugly brick blocks\r\nand alternating wooden shacks with corrugated iron false fronts; but\r\nthis is splendor to the mind of the narrator. And so in all reverence\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n      (_Sweet flute music_)\r\n\r\n      Jesus came from out the court-house door,\r\n      Stretched his hands above the passing poor.\r\n      Booth saw not, but led his queer ones there\r\n      Round and round the mighty court-house square.\r\n\r\nFrom this scene General Booth ascends into heaven. \"The Congo\" is a\r\nsimilar piece of interpretation. Few types could seem more hopeless\r\nthan the levee negroes, yet through them Mr. Lindsay makes a study\r\nof their race. In a drunken saloon crowd he sees the basic savagery\r\nwhich back in the Congo forests displays itself in picturesque poetry\r\nstuff. In a group of crapshooters who laugh down a police raid he finds\r\nthe irrepressible high spirits which carry the negroes in imagination\r\nback to a regal Congo cakewalk, and in the exhortations of an African\r\nevangelist he sees the same hope of religion which the slave brought\r\nwith him from his native soil. Once again, \"The Chinese Nightingale\"\r\nis written in the same spirit, this time accounting for the Chinese\r\nlaundry-man's tireless industry through the fact that while his iron\r\npounds in the dead of night he is living in a world of oriental romance.\r\n\r\nMr. Lindsay's poetry has two chief aspects, sometimes separated,\r\nsometimes compounded. One of these is an ethical seriousness. He might\r\nbe called an ideally provincial character. He chooses to express\r\nhimself in terms of his home and neighborhood, but his interests move\r\nout through a series of concentric circles which include his city, his\r\nstate, America, and the world federation. The poems on Springfield,\r\ntherefore, are of a piece with the poems on \"America Watching the\r\nWar\" and those on \"America at War.\" \"The Soul of the City,\" with Mr.\r\nLindsay's own drawings, is quite as interesting as any of the poems\r\nabove mentioned. \"Springfield Magical\" suggests the source of his\r\ninspiration:\r\n\r\n      In this, the City of my Discontent,\r\n      Sometimes there comes a whisper from the grass,\r\n      \"Romance, Romance--is here. No Hindu town\r\n      Is quite so strange. No Citadel of Brass\r\n      By Sinbad found, held half such love and hate;\r\n      No picture-palace in a picture-book\r\n      Such webs of Friendship, Beauty, Greed and Fate!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Proud Farmer,\" \"The Illinois Village,\" and \"On the Building of\r\nSpringfield\"--three poems which conclude the General William Booth\r\nvolume--are all on his favorite thesis and were favorites with his\r\nfarmhouse auditors.\r\n\r\nHis poems related to the war reveal him as an ardent democrat, a hater\r\nof tyranny, a peace-loving socialist, and, in the end, like millions\r\nof his countrymen, a combatant pacifist, but none the less a pacifist\r\nin the larger sense. A pair of stanzas, \"Concerning Emperors,\" are\r\na very pretty cue both to himself and his convictions. The first in\r\nfervent seriousness prays for new regicides; the second states the case\r\nunsmilingly, but as it might be put to any newsboy, concluding:\r\n\r\n      And yet I cannot hate the Kaiser (I hope you understand).\r\n      Yet I chase the thing he stands for with a brickbat in my hand.\r\n\r\nThis leads naturally to his verses of fancy and whimsy, like the\r\ngroup called the \"Christmas Tree,\" \"loaded with pretty toys,\" or the\r\ntwenty poems in which the moon is the chief figure of speech. And\r\nthese lead naturally to his distinctive work in connection with poetic\r\nform, his fanciful and often whimsical experiments in restoring the\r\nhalf-chanted Greek choral odes to modern usage--what W. B. Yeats calls\r\n\"the primitive singing of music\" (expounding it charmingly in the\r\nvolume \"Ideas of Good and Evil\"). Mr. Lindsay, in the \"Congo\" volume\r\nhas indicated on some of the margins ways in which the verses might\r\nbe chanted. Before many audiences he has illustrated his intent with\r\nawkwardly convincing effectiveness. And with the Poem Games, printed\r\nwith \"The Chinese Nightingale,\" he has actually enlisted unsuspecting\r\naudiences as choruses and sent them home thrilled and amused at their\r\nawakened poetic susceptibility. Mr. Lindsay's theories are briefly\r\nindicated in the two books just mentioned, in Miss Harriet Monroe's\r\nintroduction to the former and in the poet's explanation of Poem Games\r\nin the latter. They are briefly stated and should be read by every\r\nstudent of his work. Like most of the developments in modern poetry\r\nthey are very new only in being a revival of something very old, but in\r\ntheir application they are local, and they partake of their author's\r\ngenial, informal, democratic nature in being very American. Among the\r\ncontemporary poets who are likely to leave an individual impress on\r\nAmerican literature, Mr. Lindsay, to use a good Americanism, is one of\r\nthe few who \"will certainly bear watching.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Amy Lowell (1874- ) was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. James\r\nRussell Lowell was a cousin of her grandfather, and she numbers among\r\nher relatives her mother's father, Abbott Lawrence, minister to\r\nEngland, and a brother, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard.\r\nIn her education general reading and wide travel were the most\r\nimportant factors. In 1902, at the age of twenty-eight, she decided\r\nto devote herself to poetry, and for the next eight years she studied\r\nand wrote without attempting publication. Her first verse was printed\r\nin the _Atlantic Monthly_ in 1910, and her first volume, \"A Dome of\r\nMany-Colored Glass,\" was published in 1912. Her further volumes have\r\nbeen \"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\" (1914), \"Six French Poets\" (1915),\r\n\"Men, Women and Ghosts\" (1916), \"Tendencies in Modern American Poetry\"\r\n(1917), and \"Can Grande's Castle\" (1919),--in all, four volumes\r\nof verse and two of prose criticism. She has been a conspicuous\r\npersonality among contemporary poets in France, England, and America,\r\nand though she has not been lacking in self-assertiveness she has been\r\nwithout question chiefly interested in the progress of contemporary\r\npoetry and finely generous in both theory and practice in the support\r\nof her fellow-poets.\r\n\r\nAs one of her most recent critics has pointed out, she has been\r\nnotable and notably American in her zest for argument and in her love\r\nof experiment--\"a female Roosevelt among the Parnassians.\" She has\r\nchampioned the cause of modern poetry and has fought the conventions of\r\nVictorian verse wherever she has encountered them, and in her liking\r\nfor experiment and her absorption in technique she has taken up the\r\ncudgels successively for free verse, for the tenets of Imagism, and\r\nfor polyphonic prose. She has been most closely identified with the\r\nactivities of the Imagist poets,--three Englishmen, two Anglicized\r\nAmericans, and herself,--and it is therefore well to summarize the six\r\nobjects to which they committed themselves: (1) to use the language of\r\ncommon speech, but to employ always the exact word, (2) to create new\r\nrhythms as the expression of new moods, (3) to allow absolute freedom\r\nin the choice of subject (within the limits of good taste), (4) to\r\npresent an image (hence the name \"Imagist\"), (5) to produce poetry that\r\nis hard and clear, (6) to insist on concentration as the essence of\r\npoetry. A stanza from \"Before the Altar,\" the opening poem in her first\r\nbook, serves to illustrate her technique as an Imagist:\r\n\r\n      His sole condition\r\n      Love and poverty.\r\n      And while the moon\r\n      Swings slow across the sky,\r\n      Athwart a waving pine tree,\r\n      And soon\r\n      Tips all the needles there\r\n      With silver sparkles, bitterly\r\n      He gazes, while his soul\r\n      Grows hard with thinking of the poorness of his dole.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of \"Spring Day,\" the poem in \"Men, Women and Ghosts\"\r\nwhich begins with the much-discussed \"Bath,\" is an example of her\r\n\"polyphonic prose\":\r\n\r\n                     MIDDAY AND AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n  Swirl of crowded streets. Shock and recoil of traffic. The\r\n  stock-still brick façade of an old church, against which the waves\r\n  of people lurch and withdraw. Flare of sunshine down side-streets.\r\n  Eddies of light in the windows of chemists' shops, with their blue,\r\n  gold, purple jars, darting colors far into the crowd. Loud bangs and\r\n  tremors, murmurings out of high windows, whirring of machine belts,\r\n  blurring of horses and motors. A quick spin and shudder of brakes\r\n  on an electric car, and the jar of a church-bell knocking against\r\n  the metal blue of the sky. I am a piece of the town, a bit of blown\r\n  dust, thrust along with the crowd. Proud to feel the pavement under\r\n  me, reeling with feet. Feet tripping, skipping, lagging, dragging,\r\n  plodding doggedly or springing up and advancing on firm, elastic\r\n  insteps. A boy is selling papers, I smell them clean and new from\r\n  the press. They are fresh like the air, and pungent as tulips and\r\n  narcissus.\r\n\r\n  The blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold blind the\r\n  shop-windows, putting out their contents in a flood of flame.\r\n\r\nIn her essay on John Gould Fletcher, in \"Tendencies in Modern American\r\nPoetry,\" Miss Lowell has defined the æsthetic intent of this poetic\r\nform: \"'Polyphonic' means--many-voiced--and the form is so-called\r\nbecause it makes use of all the 'voices' of poetry, namely: metre,\r\n_vers libre_, assonance, alliteration, rhyme and return. It employs\r\nevery form of rhythm, even prose rhythm at times, but usually holds\r\nno particular one for long.... The rhymes may come at the ends of the\r\ncadences, or may appear in close juxtaposition to each other, or may\r\nbe only distantly related.\" These two forms, with the aid of the two\r\nformulas, may be tested at leisure from an abundance of passages; they\r\ncorrespond with their recipes, are distinct from each other, and have\r\ncertain distinctive beauties. But a further experiment--the attempt to\r\nmake the cadences of free verse harmonize with the movements of natural\r\nobjects--is by no means so successful. \"If the reader will turn,\" says\r\nMiss Lowell, in the preface to \"Men, Women and Ghosts,\" \"to the poem 'A\r\nRoxbury Garden,' he will find in the first two sections an attempt to\r\ngive the circular movement of a hoop bowling along the ground, and the\r\nup-and-down, elliptical curve of a flying shuttlecock.\" The following,\r\npresumably, is a segment of the circular movement:\r\n\r\n      \"I will beat you Minna,\" cries Stella,\r\n      Hitting her hoop smartly with her stick.\r\n      \"Stella, Stella, we are winning,\" calls Minna,\r\n      As her hoop curves round a bed of clove-pinks.\r\n\r\nIt is an example, in fact, of the fruitlessness of dwelling on a matter\r\nof artistic form till it becomes more important than the artistic\r\ncontent. Miss Lowell admits in this connection that there flashed into\r\nher mind \"the idea of using the movement of poetry.\" The student,\r\ntherefore, should not regard the resultant verses as anything more than\r\nexperiments in technique, and at the same time he should speculate as\r\nto whether a vital artistic form can ever be imposed upon a subject\r\ninstead of springing spontaneously from it.\r\n\r\nYet, although Miss Lowell's reputation rests mainly on her experiments\r\nin novel and striking poetic forms, most of her work has been written\r\nin conformity with classic traditions. The opening volume is all in\r\ncommon rhythms, and so is most of the second, and quite half of the\r\nthird. The last alone is devoted to a new form; \"Can Grande's Castle\"\r\ncontains four long poems in polyphonic prose. The tendency is clearly\r\nin the direction of the innovations, but thus far the balance is about\r\neven between the new and the old.\r\n\r\nAs to subject matter, Miss Lowell's thesis is Poe's: that poetry should\r\nnot teach either facts or morals, but should be dedicated to beauty; it\r\nis a stained-glass window, a colored transparency. And the poet is a\r\nnonsocial being who\r\n\r\n        spurns life's human friendships to profess\r\n      Life's loneliness of dreaming ecstacy.\r\n\r\nLike Poe she limits herself to the production of lyrics and tales and\r\nresorts not infrequently to grotesques and arabesques. Unlike Poe her\r\nresort to horror leads her to the composition of sex infidelities which\r\nare sometimes boring, sometimes foul, and rarely interesting. On this\r\npoint (rule three for the Imagists) Miss Lowell falters awkwardly.\r\n\"'How can the choice of subject be absolutely unrestricted?'--horrified\r\ncritics have asked. The only reply to such a question is that one had\r\nsupposed one were speaking to people of common sense and intelligence.\"\r\nThe bounds of taste are assumed; yet these, she hastens to state,\r\ndiffer for different judges, and she illustrates her contention by\r\nthe extreme extensiveness of her own. Finally, and again like Poe,\r\nMiss Lowell is to a high degree bookishly literary in her choice and\r\ntreatment of subjects.\r\n\r\nAfter all, for the attentive reader of contemporary poetry Miss\r\nLowell's most distinguished service has been in her two books of\r\ncriticism. In the concourse of present-day poets she is a kind of drum\r\nmajor. One cannot see the procession without seeing her or admiring the\r\nskill with which she swings and tosses the baton. But when the parade\r\nis past, one can easily forget her until the trumpets blare again. She\r\nleads the way effectively, and one is glad to have her do it,--glad\r\nthat there are those who enjoy being excellent drum majors. Then one\r\npays farewell to her in the words with which she salutes Ezra Pound in\r\nher verses headed \"Astigmatism\": \"Peace be with you, [Sister]. You have\r\nchosen your part.\"\r\n\r\nWitter Bynner (1881- ) was born in Brooklyn and is a graduate of\r\nHarvard in the class of 1902. He took the impress of his university and\r\nrecorded it not only in an \"Ode to Harvard\" (1907)--reprinted in \"Young\r\nHarvard and Other Poems\"--but also in the two plays that followed,\r\n\"Tiger\" (1913) and \"The Little King\" (1914), neither of which have\r\nanything to do with Harvard, but both of which reflect the intelligent\r\ninterest in drama encouraged at that seat of learning. Aside from\r\n\"Iphigenia in Tauris\" (1915), his remaining work, in which his real\r\ndistinction lies, is the single poem \"The New World\" (1915) and the\r\ncollection \"Grenstone Poems\" (1917). Into both of these are woven\r\nthreads of the same story,--the poet's love and marriage to Celia, the\r\ninspiration which comes to him from her finer nature, the birth and\r\nloss of their child, the death of Celia, his dull bereavement, the\r\ndedication of his life to the democracy which Celia had taught him to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\"Grenstone Poems\" is a series of little idyls comparable in some\r\nrespects to Frost's \"A Boy's Will.\" They are wholly individual in\r\ntone, presenting in brief lyrics, nearly two hundred in number, the\r\nquaint and lovely elements in the humor and the tragedy of life. \"The\r\nNew World,\" in contrast, contains by implication much of this, but is\r\nconstructed in nine sections which trace the progressive steps in the\r\npoet's idealization of America. Always Celia's imagination leads far\r\nin advance of his own. Again and again as he strives to follow, his\r\ntriumphant ascent reaches as its climax what to her is a lower round\r\nin the ladder. Two passages suggest the theme in the abstract, though\r\nthe beauty of the poem lies chiefly in the far implications of definite\r\nscenes and episodes. The first is a speech of Celia's:\r\n\r\n      It is my faith that God is our own dream\r\n      Of perfect understanding of the soul.\r\n      It is my passion that, alike through me\r\n      And every member of eternity,\r\n      The source of God is sending the same stream.\r\n      It is my peace that when my life is whole,\r\n      God's life shall be completed and supreme.\r\n\r\nThe second, with which this volume may well conclude, is in the poet's\r\nown words:\r\n\r\n          In temporary pain\r\n      The age is bearing a new breed\r\n      Of men and women, patriots of the world\r\n      And one another. Boundaries in vain,\r\n      Birthrights and countries, would constrain\r\n      The old diversity of seed\r\n      To be diversity of soul.\r\n          O mighty patriots, maintain\r\n      Your loyalty!--till flags unfurled\r\n      For battle shall arraign\r\n      The traitors who unfurled them, shall remain\r\n      And shine over an army with no slain,\r\n      And men from every nation shall enroll\r\n      And women--in the hardihood of peace!\r\n          What can my anger do but cease?\r\n      Whom shall I fight and who shall be my enemy\r\n      When he is I and I am he?\r\n\r\n          Let me have done with that old God outside\r\n      Who watched with preference and answered prayer,\r\n      The Godhead that replied\r\n      Now here, now there,\r\n      Where heavy cannon were\r\n      Or coins of gold!\r\n      Let me receive communion with all men,\r\n      Acknowledging our one and only soul!\r\n          For not till then\r\n      Can God be God, till we ourselves are whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK LIST\r\n\r\n\r\n=_General References_=\r\n\r\n  The Younger American Poets.

The basis of selection\r\nhas been to include only those which published a generous amount of\r\nliterature which is still remembered or those of which leading men of\r\nletters were editors.\r\n\r\nIt was intended at first to make the list identical with the\r\nperiodicals mentioned in the text, but this proved not to be practical.\r\nOn some of the earlier ones it was not possible to secure exact data\r\nconcerning length of life, editors, and contributors. Some others\r\nmentioned in the text were not of importance enough to justify\r\ninclusion. Still others, though not mentioned in the text, were too\r\nimportant to be omitted. The list as it stands, therefore, represents\r\nthe judgment of the author and would not coincide with that of any\r\nother compiler of a list of equal length. It will serve, however, as a\r\nfairly representative list and will, perhaps, move some other student\r\nof American literature to what is greatly needed--a relatively complete\r\nand compact \"Who's Who\" of American periodicals.\r\n\r\nAs yet such material is very meager and unsatisfactory. The great\r\nnumber of magazines and the bewildering consolidations, changes\r\nof editorship, title, form, period of publication, and place of\r\npublication have apparently discouraged anyone's attempting a\r\ndefinitive piece of work. On this account and with this explanation the\r\nfollowing brief appendix has been prepared.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN MAGAZINE, THE, 1875----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1875. From 1884 to 1888 the _Brooklyn Magazine_, then\r\nresumed its own name, continuing without important developments till it\r\nentered on its present régime in 1905. This came with the absorption of\r\n_Leslie's_ and the assumption of control by Ray Stannard Baker, Lincoln\r\nSteffens, and Ida Tarbell, all former staff writers for _McClure's_.\r\nIn this latter period it has been specially successful in recognizing\r\nyounger authors. It has printed much by Bynner, O. Henry, Lindsay,\r\nWhitlock, and Poole; by Eaton and Hamilton on the drama; by F. P. Dunne\r\n(\"Mr. Dooley\"), George Ade, and Irvin Cobb; and, among foreign authors,\r\nby Wells, Bennett, Kipling, and Locke. It is popular in policy and\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nATLANTIC MONTHLY, THE, 1857----. A Boston monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1857, Francis H. Underwood the prime mover, with the\r\nintention of setting new standards for a literary magazine of American\r\nauthorship. Lowell was first editor; the first notable essay series\r\nHolmes's \"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table\"; the first popular serial\r\nstory, Mrs. Stowe's \"Dred.\" The field has been consistently divided\r\namong fiction, essay, and poetry, and the book reviewing has always\r\nbeen scrupulous. The editors have been Lowell, James T. Fields, W. D.\r\nHowells, T. B. Aldrich, Horace Scudder, W. H. Page, Bliss Perry, and\r\nthe present editor and chief owner, Ellery Sedgwick. Early important\r\ncontributors were Emerson, Holmes, Longfellow, Lowell, Thoreau,\r\nWhittier, Hawthorne, Wendell Phillips. Later issues have included\r\nLafcadio Hearn, Edith Wharton, Frank Norris, Agnes Repplier, Gerald\r\nStanley Lee, S. M. Crothers, William Vaughn Moody, Richard Hovey, and\r\nmost of the contributors to the best traditions in American literature.\r\n(See \"The Atlantic Monthly and its Makers,\" by M. A. De Wolfe Howe.)\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE SATURDAY VISITER, 1833----(?). A Baltimore weekly.\r\n\r\nStarted by Lambert A. Wilmer, who continued with it for only six\r\nmonths. In October of this year Poe's \"MS. Found in a Bottle\" was\r\npublished as the winner of a prize competition. This was Poe's one\r\ncontribution and the _Visiter's_ sole apparent title to fame.\r\n\r\nBROADWAY JOURNAL, 1845. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nFounded by C. F. Briggs (\"Harry Franco\") in January, 1845. So named\r\naccording to the first editorial from \"the first street in the first\r\ncity of the New World.... We shall attempt to make it entirely\r\noriginal, and instead of the effete vapors of English magazines ...\r\ngive such thoughts as may be generated among us.\" Poe and Briggs were\r\nassociate editors in the spring, until in July, 1845, it went under the\r\nsole charge of Poe, who bought it from Briggs for $50. During this year\r\nit was Poe's chief vehicle, printing or reprinting some fifteen of his\r\nprose tales and two poems. Its business failure took place at the end\r\nof the first year. (See \"Life of Poe,\" by George E. Woodberry.)\r\n\r\nBROOKLYN DAILY EAGLE, 1841. A Brooklyn daily.\r\n\r\nIsaac Van Anden, first editor and publisher. A democratic newspaper\r\nwith independent judgment. From 1844 (?) to 1848 Walt Whitman was its\r\neditor. From 1885, until his recent death, it was under charge of St.\r\nClair McKelway, a brilliant writer and speaker and a constructive\r\neducator.\r\n\r\nBURTON'S GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE (see _Gentleman's Magazine_).\r\n\r\nCASKET, THE (_Graham's Magazine_), 1826-1840. A Philadelphia\r\nmonthly.\r\n\r\nCalled _Atkinson's Casket_, 1831-1840. Was combined with _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_ and became _Graham's Magazine_.\r\n\r\nCENTURY MAGAZINE, THE, 1881----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nA continuation of the older _Scribner's Monthly_ (1870-1881) on the\r\nassumption of control by Roswell Smith. R. W. Gilder was editor from\r\nthe second number, till his death in 1907. Its policy was to publish\r\narticles, singly and in series, related to broad aspects of American\r\nlife, exposition and poetry playing a larger part in the earlier\r\nyears than of late. In travel it published Lowell's \"Impressions of\r\nSpain\" and van Dyke's \"Sicily\"; in biography later portions of Hay and\r\nNicolay's \"Lincoln,\" Jefferson's autobiography, and a Napoleon series.\r\nRiis, Bryce, Darwin, Tolstoy, and Burroughs have contributed from their\r\nown fields. Notable fiction series have been contributed by Howells,\r\nMark Twain, Crawford, Weir Mitchell, Garland, London, and Mrs. Wharton;\r\nand verse by Emerson, Whitman, Gilder, Moody, Markham, and Cawein. (See\r\nalso _Scribner's Monthly_, p. 499.)\r\n\r\nCONGREGATIONALIST AND CHRISTIAN WORLD, THE, 1849----. A Boston\r\nweekly.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1816 as the _Boston Recorder_ by Nathaniel Willis, father\r\nof the more famous Nathaniel Parker Willis, and conducted by him until\r\n1844. From then till about 1890 it was the sectarian organ of the\r\nCongregationalists, playing a rôle similar to that of the _Independent_\r\nand the _Christian Union_. In the latter part of the nineteenth century\r\nit was under the editorship of W. A. Dunning, who was succeeded by the\r\npresent editor, Horace Bridgman. It has had a consistent career as a\r\nreligious weekly, changing with the times, but not modifying itself for\r\nthe sake of a secular circulation so frankly as the other two have done.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATOR, THE, 1890. A Philadelphia monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1890 by Horace Traubel, an independent exponent of the\r\nworld movement in ethics. In 1892 W. H. Ketler, Joseph Gilbert, W.\r\nThornton Innes, and James A. Brown added to the editorial staff and\r\nenlarged to contain articles of timely interest, a book-review section,\r\nand a \"Budget\" for the reports of the ethical societies. The chief\r\ncontributors: Stanton Coit, William Salter, Robert Ingersoll, and M.\r\nM. Mangasarian. The magazine gradually dropped its study of ethical\r\nquestions and became an exponent of \"the Whitman argument,\" treated\r\nby Bucke, Harned, Kennedy, Platt, and Helena Born. In 1890 Traubel\r\nadded extensive dramatic criticism and enlarged the book-review\r\ndepartment. Since 1898 the magazine has been an expression of Traubel's\r\nradical theories. It contains a long editorial \"Collect,\" which is an\r\nuncompromising criticism of the times, a long poem by Traubel, and\r\nreviews of current books of socialistic tendencies. During the Great\r\nWar it was frankly pacific, before the entrance of the United States.\r\n\r\nCRITIC, THE, 1881-1906. A New York bi-weekly (1881-1882),\r\nweekly (1883-1898), and monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded as a \"fortnightly review of literature, the fine arts, music,\r\nand the drama.\" The best known of its editors were the latest--J. L.\r\nand J. B. Gilder. After the first four years art and music notes were\r\ndropped and book reviews were made the leading feature, original essays\r\ngiving place to extracts from other magazines. In 1900 the design was\r\nstated to be \"an illustrated monthly review of literature, art, and\r\nlife.\" From 1905 politics and technical science were dropped. In 1906\r\nit was absorbed by _Putnam's_. Best-known contributors: E. C. Stedman,\r\nEdith M. Thomas, R. W. Gilder, John Burroughs, E. E. Hale, F. B.\r\nSanborn, J. C. Harris, Brander Matthews.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC REVIEW, THE UNITED STATES, 1837-1859 (?). A\r\nWashington and New York quarterly.\r\n\r\nA note in Vol. XXXVIII stated that with Vol. XXXIX it would be issued\r\nas a newspaper. At the outset it was the most successful political\r\nmagazine in the country. It was characterized by Carlyle as \"_The Dial_\r\nwith a beard.\" It was at first partisan, until, with payment for its\r\narticles, it became broader. Early contributors and best known were\r\nOrestes Augustus Brownson, Bancroft, Whittier, Bryant, and Hawthorne.\r\n\r\nDIAL, THE, 1840-1844. A Boston quarterly.\r\n\r\nFounded as a quarterly organ for the group of Transcendentalists\r\ncentering about Emerson. Editors: 1840-1842, Margaret Fuller;\r\n1842-1844, Emerson. The issues of 128 pages contained philosophical\r\nessays, discussions of German and oriental thought, comments on\r\ncontemporary art and literature, book reviews, and poetry. The\r\ncirculation never reached 300 copies, and at the end of the fourth year\r\nit was discontinued, the final debts being paid by Emerson. Leading\r\ncontributors were the editors: Thoreau, Bronson Alcott, Theodore\r\nParker, George Ripley, C. P. Cranch, J. F. Clarke, and Ellery Channing.\r\nThere was a reprint by the Rowfant Club, Cleveland, in 1901-1902,\r\nwith the addition of a historical and biographical introduction. (See\r\nintroduction to the reprint of _The Dial_, Vol. II, George Willis\r\nCooke, 1902.)\r\n\r\nDIAL, THE, 1881----. A Chicago (1881-1918) and New York\r\nfortnightly.\r\n\r\nFounded and edited for a third of a century by Francis F. Browne as a\r\nliterary review, and able to refer to itself on its thirtieth birthday\r\nas \"the only journal in America given up to the criticism of current\r\nliterature\" and \"the only literary periodical in the country not owned\r\nor controlled by a book publishing house or a newspaper.\" After one or\r\ntwo changes of control, following the death of its founder, _The Dial_\r\nwas transferred to New York in July, 1918, extending its editorial\r\npolicy to include, besides the literary features, discussions of\r\ninternationalism and of industrial and educational reconstruction.\r\n\r\nEVERYBODY'S MAGAZINE, 1899----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by John Wanamaker and for the first four years a miscellany\r\nbest characterized by the purchasers in 1903. The Ridgway-Thayer\r\nCompany on taking control announced their purpose to do away with the\r\n\"mawkish, morbid, and unreal,\" to repress questionable advertising,\r\nand in general to transform the magazine. Since then _Everybody's_ has\r\nattempted in content to satisfy all sorts of intellectual tastes and at\r\nthe same time to have a hand in the social and economic investigation\r\nof the period. The most celebrated series, which multiplied the\r\ncirculation, was Thomas W. Lawson's \"Frenzied Finance.\" Literary\r\ncontributors in recent years have included Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, O.\r\nHenry, Frank Norris, Booth Tarkington, Ernest Poole, Dorothy Canfield,\r\nand in poetry Margaret Widdemer, Witter Bynner, and others.\r\n\r\nEVERY SATURDAY, 1865-1874. A Boston weekly.\r\n\r\nA Ticknor and Field publication; one of the numerous \"eclectic\"\r\nmid-century periodicals made up of selected materials chiefly from\r\nEnglish magazines. It is of interest partly as a type and partly\r\nbecause Thomas Bailey Aldrich was editor for the nine years of its\r\nlife. In 1874 it was merged with _Littell's Living Age_(see p. 493).\r\n\r\nGALAXY, THE, 1866-1878. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\n\"An illustrated magazine of entertaining reading.\" The first volume\r\nillustrated the practice of the day in featuring English authors with a\r\nleading serial by Anthony Trollope. The American contributors include\r\nBayard Taylor, Howells, Stedman, and William Winter. Later Charles\r\nReade was accompanied by Henry James, John Burroughs, E. R. Sill, and\r\nPaul Hamilton Hayne. With contributors of this substantial secondary\r\nrank, later still supplemented by Sidney Lanier and Joaquin Miller, the\r\n_Galaxy_ completed and died with its twelfth year.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE, Burton's (1837-1841). A Philadelphia\r\nmonthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by William E. Burton, the actor. Poe was an early, important\r\ncontributor and in the second year the editor. Although he and Burton\r\nseparated in 1839, the proprietor saw to it that Poe was reëmployed\r\nwhen in 1841 George R. Graham bought out its circulation of 3500 and\r\nmerged it with _Atkinson's Casket_ as _Graham's Magazine_.\r\n\r\nGODEY'S LADY'S BOOK, 1830-1898. A Philadelphia monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by Louis A. Godey, July, 1830, and managed by him as a monthly\r\nuntil 1877. In 1837 it absorbed the Boston _Lady's Magazine_ and took\r\nover its editor, Sarah J. Hale. Its chief distinction and highest\r\ncirculation (150,000) came under its first manager. It printed much\r\nearly work of Longfellow, Holmes, Poe, Bayard Taylor, Mrs. Sigourney,\r\nand Harriet Beecher Stowe. In its last years it was renamed _Godey's\r\nMagazine_. In 1898 it was absorbed by the _Puritan_.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM'S MAGAZINE, 1841-1859. A Philadelphia monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by George R. Graham by combining his _Atkinson's Casket_\r\nwith his purchase of Burton's _Gentleman's Magazine_. Within a year,\r\nlargely through Poe's editorial work, the circulation rose from 5000\r\nto 30,000. By 1850 it had reached a circulation of 135,000. Among the\r\nlater editors were R. W. Griswold, Bayard Taylor, and Charles Godfrey\r\nLeland, and among the contributors, Cooper, Longfellow, Poe, Hawthorne,\r\nLowell, N. P. Willis, E. P. Whipple, the Cary sisters, William Gilmore\r\nSimms, Richard Penn Smith, and Thomas Dunn English. In January, 1859,\r\n_Graham's_ became the _American Monthly_ (see \"Philadelphia Magazines\r\nand their Contributors,\" A. H. Smyth, 1892, and the _Critic_, Vol. XXV,\r\np. 44).\r\n\r\nHARPER'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 1850----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by Harper Brothers in order \"to place within the reach of\r\nthe great mass of the American people the unbounded treasures of the\r\nperiodical literature of the present day\"; thus it was an \"eclectic\"\r\nmagazine, and in the early years it supplemented this borrowed\r\nmagazine material with serials by the most popular English novelists.\r\nWithin four years it had a circulation of 125,000. During the 1860's\r\nit became more American in content, and in the 1870's it included a\r\nnotable series on the transformed South. In the last thirty years it\r\nhas drawn on the best-known American authors for single articles and\r\nserials: Aldrich, Howells, Lowell, Wister, Mrs. Deland, Mark Twain,\r\nJames, Harte, Mrs. Wharton, Tarkington, Allen; and it has shared in\r\nthe publication of recent significant poetry by Cawein, Le Gallienne,\r\nUntermeyer, Bynner, and the Misses Thomas, Teasdale, Widdemer, and\r\nLowell. (See \"The House of Harper,\" J. H. Harper, 1912, and \"The Making\r\nof a Great Magazine,\" Harper & Brothers, 1889.)\r\n\r\nHOME JOURNAL, THE, 1847----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nJointly founded and conducted by George P. Morris and N. P. Willis as\r\na continuation of their _National Press_ (founded 1845). Both remained\r\nwith it till death--Willis, the survivor, till 1865. \"It was and is,\"\r\nwrote H. A. Beers in his Life of N. P. Willis (1885), \"the organ of\r\n'japonicadom,' the journal of society, and gazette of fashionable\r\nliterature, addressing itself with assiduous gallantry to 'the ladies.'\"\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT, THE, 1848----. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nA periodical \"Conducted by Pastors of Congregational Churches\"; Leonard\r\nBacon, the first editor; Reverend George B. Cheever and Reverend Henry\r\nWard Beecher, contributing editors. Its purpose was to be a progressive\r\nreligious journal, particularly for Congregationalists, who protested\r\nagainst conservatism in theology and proslavery politics. Eventually\r\nit became an open forum for the liberally minded of all sects, being\r\ncarefully nonpartisan in politics. From 1870 to 1890 it printed\r\ngood verse, notably poems by Joaquin Miller and Sidney Lanier. The\r\nreligious and political viewpoints broadened out from 1873. By 1898 an\r\nevident attempt was made to popularize the magazine. Since 1914 it has\r\nabsorbed the _Chautauquan_, the _Countryside_, and _Harper's Weekly_.\r\n\r\nKNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE, THE, 1833-1865. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nThe first editor was Charles Fenno Hoffman. From 1839 to 1841 Irving\r\nwrote monthly articles for a salary of $2000. Bryant, Whittier,\r\nLongfellow, Holmes, Halleck, and most of the secondary writers\r\ncontributed. The second editor, from 1841 to 1861, was Lewis Gaylord\r\nClark. In its later years the magazine declined, chiefly because it was\r\ncarrying the tradition of polite and aimless literature into Civil-War\r\ntimes. During its period it stood in the North for the same interests\r\nthat its contemporary, the _Southern Literary Messenger_, did in the\r\nSouth (see \"The Knickerbocker Gallery,\" 1855, and _Harper's Magazine_,\r\nVol. XLVIII, p. 587).\r\n\r\nLIBERATOR, THE, 1831-1865. A Boston weekly.\r\n\r\nThe most famous and effective abolition journal, founded and edited\r\nthroughout by William Lloyd Garrison. It was proscribed in the South\r\nand denounced in the North. Wendell Phillips and Henry Ward Beecher\r\npraised it, but Mrs. Stowe criticized and Horace Greeley misrepresented\r\nit. The financial straits it passed through were augmented by the\r\nrivalry of other abolition papers. After the Emancipation Proclamation\r\nand Lincoln's second Inaugural, announcement of discontinuance was\r\nmade. The last issue appeared December 29, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIPPINCOTT'S MAGAZINE, 1868-1916. A Philadelphia monthly.\r\n\r\nOne of three magazines founded near 1870--the others _Scribner's\r\nMonthly_ and the _Galaxy_--that made an active market for American\r\nwriters. _Lippincott's_, \"a magazine of literature, science, and\r\neducation,\" made an unpretentious start and throughout its career\r\npublished little prose of distinction. Its poetry, however, was\r\nexcellent. Bayard Taylor and Paul Hamilton Hayne appeared in the\r\nfirst and following numbers. Margaret Preston, Emma Lazarus, Thomas\r\nB. Read, George H. Boker, Thomas Dunn English, and Christopher P.\r\nCranch contributed frequently. Whitman, rare in the magazines, wrote\r\nin prose, and, most important of all, Lanier found here a channel for\r\nmuch of his verse from 1875 on. In later years a feature of many issues\r\nwas a complete short novel. In 1916 _Lippincott's_ was absorbed by\r\n_Scribner's Magazine_.\r\n\r\nLITTELL'S LIVING AGE, 1844----. A Boston monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is the longest-lived of the eclectic, or \"scissors and paste-pot,\"\r\nmagazines. It has been made up of reprints from foreign periodicals,\r\nsometimes quoting from English apparent sources articles which had been\r\nborrowed there from original American publications. In 1874 it absorbed\r\n_Every Saturday_ (see p. 491) and in 1898 the _Eclectic Magazine_. It\r\nstill survives.\r\n\r\nMCCLURE'S MAGAZINE, 1893----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nS. S. McClure publisher and editor. Fiction and poetry have been\r\nthe dominant features. Contributors (fiction): Kipling, Stevenson,\r\nArnold Bennett, Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington, Robert\r\nChambers, O. Henry, Jack London; (verse): Wordsworth, Browning, Walt\r\nWhitman (reprints), Kipling, Witter Bynner, Edgar Lee Masters, Hermann\r\nHagedorn, Louis Untermeyer. It was the first magazine to sell at the\r\npopular price of fifteen cents. The nonliterary articles on affairs\r\nof the day were prepared on assignment by expert writers such as Ida\r\nTarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, and Lincoln Steffens, years sometimes\r\nbeing spent on a single series. In 1905 these three assumed control of\r\nthe _American_, but the policy has been continued to the present.\r\n\r\nMIRROR, THE NEW YORK, 1823-1846. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nFounded by George P. Morris and Samuel Woodworth (remembered\r\nrespectively for \"Woodman, Spare that Tree\" and \"The Old Oaken\r\nBucket\"). In 1831 the _Mirror_ absorbed the _Boston American Monthly_\r\ntogether with its editor, Nathaniel Parker Willis. In the next year\r\nWillis wrote for it the first of his travel series, \"Pencillings by the\r\nWay,\" continuing with weekly letters for four years. In 1839 Hawthorne\r\nbecame a contributor. In 1844-1845 Poe was subeditor and critic, his\r\nmost famous contribution being \"The Raven,\" January, 1845. In 1845\r\nthe weekly became a daily--the _Evening Mirror_--and in 1846 it was\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nNATION, THE, 1865----. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nPublishers: Joseph H. Richards, 1865; Evening Post Publishing Co.,\r\n1871; E. L. Godkin Co., 1874; _Evening Post_, 1881; _New York Evening\r\nPost_, 1902; Nation Press, Inc., New York, 1915. Editors have changed\r\nfrequently, the most famous being the first, E. L. Godkin, who was\r\nin the chair from 1865 to 1881. Oswald Garrison Villard, present\r\neditor. It has been devoted to discussions of politics, art, and\r\nliterature and to reviews of the leading books in these fields.\r\nRepresentative contributors have been Francis Parkman, T. R. Lounsbury,\r\nB. L. Gildersleeve, J. R. Lowell, Carl Schurz, James Bryce, William\r\nJames, Paul Shorey, and Stuart Sherman. (See \"Fifty Years of American\r\nIdealism,\" edited by Gustav Pollak. 1915. Also the \"Semicentenary\r\nNumber,\" 1915.)\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND COURANT, THE, 1721-1727. A Boston weekly.\r\n\r\nFounded by James Franklin and carried on by him and a group of friends\r\nknown as the Hell-Fire Club. The _Courant_ represents a violent and\r\nsomewhat coarse reaction against the domination of the New England\r\nclergy. It was written after the manner of the _Spectator_ with\r\nfrequent paraphrased and a few quoted passages. After the imprisonment\r\nof James the paper was carried on by the youthful Benjamin Franklin,\r\nwho had already contributed the fourteen \"Do-Good Papers.\" The\r\n_Courant_ gave evidence of much wit and enterprise, but quite lacked\r\nthe urbanity of its English model.\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE, THE, 1831-1835. A Boston monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by Joseph T. Buckingham, former editor of the\r\n_Polyanthus_,1805-1807 and 1812-1814, the _Ordeal_,1809, the _New\r\nEngland Galaxy_,1817-1828, and the _Boston Courier,_, a daily,\r\n1814-1848. The _New England Magazine_, superior to any of these, was\r\nthe project of Edwin, a son, who gave it distinction in a single year\r\nof editorship before his death, at the age of twenty-two. The father\r\ncontinued in charge for eighteen months, relinquishing it for the final\r\nyear to Charles Fenno Hoffman and Park Benjamin. These latter took\r\nthe magazine to New York in January, 1836, renaming it the _American\r\nMonthly Magazine_. The younger Buckingham showed enterprise in\r\nenlisting well-known contributors and acuteness in securing copy from\r\nLongfellow, Whittier, Holmes, and Hawthorne before they were widely\r\nknown. It was in the _New England_ that Holmes originated \"The Autocrat\r\nof the Breakfast Table\" in two numbers of 1832, reviving the theme in\r\nhis first _Atlantic_ series twenty-five years later; and here also\r\nHawthorne printed many stories now in \"Twice-Told Tales\" and \"Mosses\r\nfrom an Old Manse.\" (See \"The First _New England Magazine_ and its\r\nEditor,\" by George Willis Cooke, _New England Magazine_ (N. S.), March,\r\n1897.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK EVENING POST, THE, 1801----. A New York daily.\r\n\r\nA Federal paper at first. Alexander Hamilton and John Jay aided in its\r\nestablishment. William Coleman, first editor. Bryant began to write for\r\nthe _Post_ in 1826. He was editor from 1829 to 1878.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK REVIEW AND ATHENÆUM MAGAZINE, THE, (?)-1827. A New\r\nYork monthly.\r\n\r\nA type of the short-lived magazine which rose and then combined with\r\nor absorbed others in a succession of changes. This was first the\r\n_Review_, then in March, 1826, it was merged with another periodical\r\ninto the _New York Literary Gazette or American Athenæum_, and a little\r\nlater it combined with Parson's old paper, the _United States Literary\r\nGazette_, to form the _United Stales Review and Literary Gazette_. It\r\nis mentioned because of Bryant's contributions and his editorship from\r\n1826 until its discontinuation.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK TRIBUNE, THE, 1841----. A New York daily.\r\n\r\nStarted by Horace Greeley as a reform newspaper in support of President\r\nHarrison. In 1847 Greeley enlisted the support of several of the Brook\r\nFarm group--George Ripley, Margaret Fuller, Charles A. Dana, and George\r\nWilliam Curtis--and secured as later contributors Carl Schurz, John\r\nHay, Henry James, William Dean Howells, Bayard Taylor, Whitelaw Reid,\r\nE. C. Stedman, and others. The _Tribune_ made much of its literary\r\nside, not only in book reviews and discussions of contemporary art\r\nand letters but in the inclusion of much significant verse. The\r\n_Tribune_ was an important ally in securing the election of Lincoln and\r\nsupporting his policies. It has continued to be one of the leading New\r\nYork dailies, but its great days were concluded with the resignation of\r\nGreeley in 1872.\r\n\r\nNEW REPUBLIC, THE, 1914----. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nA \"journal of opinion\" founded with the assistance of Mr. Willard\r\nStraight by Herbert Croly and associates. As its subtitle indicates,\r\nit is chiefly concerned with problems of national and international\r\nimport, but, in addition to the articles by editors and contributors\r\non affairs of the day, it includes papers on the art, music, and\r\nliterature of the present and the recent past, occasional light essays,\r\ndiscriminating book reviews, and verse. Representative contributors\r\nhave been John Graham Brooks, John Dewey, William Hard, Elizabeth\r\nShipley Sargent, Louis Untermeyer, Robert Frost, Edwin Arlington\r\nRobinson, and, from England, Norman Angell, H. M. Brailsford, and H. G.\r\nWells.\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW, THE, 1815----. A Boston and New York\r\nquarterly.\r\n\r\nSuccessor to the _Boston Monthly Anthology_, 1803-1811, being founded\r\nby an editor, William Tudor, and several contributors who had been\r\nmembers of the Anthology Club. After three years as a general literary\r\nbimonthly it became a quarterly review. Among early contributors,\r\nbesides well-known leaders in political thinking, were George Ticknor,\r\nGeorge Bancroft, Bryant, and Longfellow. Until the founding of the\r\n_Atlantic_ it was the leading organ of conservative thought in New\r\nEngland. For the decade from 1864 it was under the joint editorship\r\nof James Russell Lowell and Charles Eliot Norton. Since 1878 it has\r\nbeen in New York, changing in editorship and periods of publication.\r\nIt became settled as a monthly under George Harvey. The more purely\r\nliterary American contributors of the last few years have been Howells,\r\nMabie, Matthews, Woodberry, Miss Repplier, Miss Teasdale, Miss Lowell,\r\nHagedorn, Robinson, Mackaye, and Ficke. (See _North American_, Vol. C,\r\np. 315, and Vol. CCI.)\r\n\r\nOUTLOOK, THE, 1870----. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1870 as the _Christian Union_, an undenominational paper,\r\nby Henry Ward Beecher. In 1876 he shared his duties as editor with\r\nLyman Abbott, present editor. In 1884 Hamilton Wright Mabie was added\r\nas associate editor. Title was changed to _The Outlook_ in 1893.\r\nMabie secured contributions from men like James Bryce and Edward\r\nDowden, translations from the works of Daudet and François Coppée.\r\nRecent American literary contributors: Ernest Poole, Vachel Lindsay,\r\nCawein, Oppenheim. New political impetus came with contributions from\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, beginning 1909. The paper has had more or less of\r\necclesiastical character all along, but at present may be characterized\r\nas seeking to mold public opinion and interpret current events. One\r\nnumber of each month is enlarged to contain special departments; called\r\nIllustrated Magazine Number from 1896 to 1905.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE, THE, 1729-1821. A Philadelphia weekly.\r\n\r\nThe new name and new periodical founded by Benjamin Franklin when he\r\npurchased Samuel Keimer's _Universal Instructor_ in October, 1729. The\r\nnews element was slight and unreliable, but the literary, Addisonian\r\nessays gave the paper character at once. These gave way later to essays\r\nmore distinctly peculiar to Franklin's own point of view and kind of\r\nhumor. The book advertisements supplemented this essay material in\r\ncontributing to the broader culture of the readers. After Franklin's\r\npersonal withdrawal the traditions of the _Gazette_ were continued. In\r\n1765 Franklin sold out to his partner David Hall. With the death of his\r\ngrandson, also David Hall, the paper passed into the hands of Atkinson\r\nand Alexander and was renamed the _Saturday Evening Post_ (p. 498).\r\n\r\nPOETRY, 1912----. A Chicago monthly.\r\n\r\nA magazine of verse. Harriet Monroe, editor. Ralph Fletcher Seymour\r\nCo., Chicago, publishers. Advisory committee: H. B. Fuller, Edith\r\nWyatt, and H. C. Chatfield Taylor. It was guaranteed for five years\r\nby endowment fund and contained no advertisements at the beginning.\r\nIt has been a vehicle for poetry from all parts of the world by poets\r\nwith or without fame. Now it contains book-list awards, reviews, and\r\npoetry announcements and advertisements. The original staff is almost\r\nunchanged. It seems to be on a sound financial footing.\r\n\r\nPOOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC, 1733-1748.\r\n\r\nFounded by Benjamin Franklin. Its chief feature was its inclusion in\r\nthe reading matter of the proverbial sayings, the best of which were\r\ncombined in \"The Way to Wealth.\" It was characterized by a French\r\ncritic of the day as \"the first popular almanac which spoke the\r\nlanguage of reason.\" It was conducted by Franklin until 1748.\r\n\r\nPORT FOLIO, THE, 1806-1827. A Philadelphia weekly and monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by Joseph Dennie as a weekly newspaper. From 1806 to 1809,\r\nthough continuing as a weekly, it assumed the character of a literary\r\nmagazine, and in the latter year became a monthly. Its most distinctive\r\nperiod was in the first eleven years before the death of Dennie. While\r\nhe was editor the _Port Folio_ was a vehicle of \"polite letters.\" It\r\nwas imitative in style and reminiscent in point of view, but it was\r\nwholesome in its honesty about American matters and manners and exerted\r\na strong and healthy influence. The best-known contributors were the\r\neditor, \"Oliver Oldschool,\" John Quincy Adams, and Charles Brockden\r\nBrown.\r\n\r\nPUTNAM'S, 1853-1858, 1868-1870, 1906-1910. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nPublishers, G. P. Putnam and Co., New York. _Putnam's Monthly Magazine_\r\nof American literature, science, and art. Established by George P.\r\nPutnam with the assistance of George William Curtis and others.\r\nIn 1857 merged into _Emerson's United States Magazine_, which was\r\ncontinued as _Emerson's Magazine and Putnam's Monthly_. Discontinued\r\nNovember, 1858. January, 1868-November, 1870, _Putnam's Monthly\r\nMagazine_. Original papers on literature, science, art, and national\r\ninterests. Merged into _Scribner's Monthly_, December, 1870. October,\r\n1906-March, 1910, reëstablished and merged with the _Critic_, founded\r\nin 1881; issued by Messrs. Putnam since 1898. An illustrated monthly\r\nof literature, art, and life. Absorbed the _Reader_, March, 1908.\r\nTitles vary during this period. A large number of full-page and smaller\r\nillustrations. One serial running, small proportion of verse, special\r\narticles, comments, and criticisms on literature and the fine arts,\r\nscience, travel, statesmanship. Alternating emphasis with successive\r\nissues on the different arts. Typical contributors and contributions,\r\nwith illustrations concerning: Lafcadio Hearn, Mark Twain, William\r\nDean Howells, Stedman, Stoddard, Henry James, Longfellow, Franklin,\r\nMargaret Deland, Maeterlinck, Thomas Edison, Binet, Corot, Helen\r\nKeller, Nazimova, Gladstone, the Bonapartes. Absorbed by the _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_, April, 1910.\r\n\r\nROUND TABLE, THE, 1864-1869. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nA literary journal founded in New York in emulation of Boston's\r\n_Atlantic_ and supported with great interest by Aldrich, Stedman,\r\nBayard Taylor, and their circle. It was suspended during parts of\r\n1864-1865 and discontinued in July, 1869, in spite of the efforts to\r\nsecure a subsidy for it from the wealthy men of New York.\r\n\r\nRUSSELL'S MAGAZINE, 1857-1860. A Charleston monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by John Russell, Charleston bookseller, with Paul Hamilton\r\nHayne as editor. A monthly periodical for the literary group centering\r\naround William Gilmore Simms. Contained fiction, sketches, addresses,\r\nreviews, and essays on various topics--political, historical, literary,\r\nartistic, scientific. These were mainly unsigned, but the leading\r\ncontributors were Simms, Hayne, Timrod, James L. Petigru, John D.\r\nBruns, and Basil Gildersleeve. With the approach of the Civil War it\r\nwas discontinued March, 1860. (Lives of P. H. Hayne and W. G. Simms.\r\nThree Notable Ante-Bellum Magazines of South Carolina, Sidney J. Cohen,\r\nUniversity of South Carolina, _Bulletin 42_.)\r\n\r\nSATURDAY EVENING POST, THE, 1821----. A Philadelphia weekly.\r\n\r\nA lineal descendant of Franklin's _Pennsylvania Gazette_(see p. 496).\r\nIt was given its present name in 1821 when Samuel C. Atkinson and\r\nCharles Alexander took control, Atkinson being the surviving partner\r\nof David Hall, grandson and namesake of Franklin's partner to whom the\r\n_Gazette_ was sold in 1765. In one hundred and eighty years the only\r\ninterruption to consecutive issues was during the British occupation of\r\nPhiladelphia. The _Post_ of recent years has been one of the American\r\nweeklies of largest circulation. It contains fiction, up-to-date\r\npersonalia, and brisk articles on the affairs of the moment. Its\r\nattitude toward thrift, industry, and the way to wealth is completely\r\nconsistent with the ethics of Franklin. It is conducted by the Curtis\r\nPublishing Company and edited by George H. Lorimer.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY PRESS, THE, 1858-1860. A New York weekly.\r\n\r\nThe special organ of the \"Bohemians\"--a group of New Yorkers who\r\nacknowledged Henry M. Clapp as their leader. Other contributors were\r\nFitz-James O'Brien, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, R. H. Stoddard, William\r\nWinter, and E. C. Stedman, The _Press_ was brilliant but short-lived,\r\nannouncing in its last number in early 1860 that it was \"discontinued\r\nfor lack of funds which [was], by a coincidence, precisely the reason\r\nfor which it was started.\" (See H. M. Clapp in Winter's \"Other Days,\"\r\nand \"The Life of Stedman,\" by Stedman and Gould.)\r\n\r\nSCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE, 1886----. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded December, 1886, by Messrs. Scribner (entirely distinct from old\r\n_Scribner's Monthly_), with E. L. Burlingame as editor. Illustrated.\r\nTypical contributors, in the early years: H. C. Bunner, Joel Chandler\r\nHarris, Sarah Orne Jewett, Barrett Wendell, E. H. Blashford, Richard\r\nHenry Stoddard, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, T. W. Higginson, W. C. Brownell,\r\nCharles Edwin Markham, Robert Louis Stevenson; in recent years: Winston\r\nChurchill, J. L. Laughlin, W. C. Brownell, Meredith Nicholson, John\r\nGalsworthy, etc. Articles of popular interest on art, music, nature,\r\ntravel, and since 1914 a section given to the World War. Aim and policy\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nSCRIBNER'S MONTHLY, 1870-1881. A New York monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded by Roswell Smith, manager, and J. G. Holland, editor,\r\nand published as _Scribner's_, but not like _Harper's_ as a\r\npublishing-house magazine. The design from the first was to deal with\r\nmatters of social and religious opinion from the liberal viewpoint.\r\nAt the outset it absorbed _Hours at Home_ and _Putnam's_ and in 1873\r\nEdward Everett Hale's _Old and New_. It was the first to undertake\r\na series on the new South and to encourage Southern contributors,\r\nincluding Lanier, Thomas Nelson Page, George W. Cable, and Joel\r\nChandler Harris. Most notable among its series were portions of\r\nGrant's Memoirs and Hay and Nicolay's \"Life of Lincoln,\" George\r\nKennan's Siberian papers, and Hay's anonymous novel \"The Breadwinners.\"\r\n_Scribner's Monthly_ was a pioneer in the use of illustrations made by\r\nthe new mechanical methods of reproduction. The magazine never printed\r\nor sold less than 40,000 copies, and when in 1881 it changed ownership\r\nand became the _Century_ it had a circulation of 125,000. (See Tassin's\r\n\"The Magazine in America,\" pp. 287-301.)\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN LITERARY MESSENGER, 1834-1865. A Richmond monthly.\r\n\r\nFounded at Richmond, Virginia, in August, 1834, by Thomas W. White, as\r\na semimonthly, but changed to a monthly almost at once. Poe contributed\r\nto the seventh number and from then on in each number till he became\r\nassistant editor from July, 1835, to January, 1837. During this period\r\nthe circulation increased from 700 to 5000. Well established by this\r\ntime, it continued as the most substantial and longest lived of the\r\nSouthern magazines. A vehicle for literature between the too heavy\r\nand the frivolous, and an honest review. Poe's contributions outrank\r\nthose of any other writer, but the list of contributors includes N. P.\r\nWillis, C. F. Hoffman, R. W. Griswold, J. G. Holland, R. H. Stoddard,\r\nW. M. Thackeray, Charles Dickens, G. P. R. James, John Randolph, R. H.\r\nBird, Philip P. Cooke, J. W. Legare, P. H. Hayne, Henry Timrod, John P.\r\nKennedy, and Sidney Lanier. (See \"The Southern Literary Messenger,\" by\r\nB. B. Minor.)\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN MAGAZINE, THE, 1871-1875. A Baltimore monthly.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished of the several short-lived Southern magazines\r\nestablished in the Civil War reconstruction period. It was a\r\ncontinuation of the _New Eclectic_, but included, in addition to\r\nthe English reprints, original work by many Southern authors. These\r\nwere, among others, Margaret Preston, Malcolm Johnson, Sidney Lanier,\r\nPaul Hamilton Hayne, and Professors Gildersleeve and Price. It\r\ncould pay nothing for manuscript, however, and the new interest in\r\nSouthern writing awakened by _Scribner's_ in 1873, and responded to\r\nby _Harper's_, the _Atlantic_, _Lippincott's_, the _Independent_,\r\nand others, furnished support as well as stimulation to its best\r\ncontributors and hastened its death at the end of five years.\r\n\r\nWESTERN MESSENGER, THE (Cincinnati), 1835-1841.\r\n\r\nBegun by Reverend Ephraim Peabody. Published by Western Unitarian\r\nSociety aided by American Unitarian Association. Purposed to make it\r\na vehicle for clear, rational discussion of important and interesting\r\ntopics. Discussed reform movements, religious questions and creeds,\r\nand encouraged expression of all cultural ideas,--literary articles,\r\npoetry, book reviews, etc. Contributors: Mann Butler, W. D. Gallagher,\r\nJames H. Perkins, R. W. Emerson, J. S. Dwight, Elizabeth P. Peabody,\r\nJones Very, James Freeman Clarke, Dr. Lyman Beecher, Professor Calvin\r\nE. Stowe, Margaret Fuller, C. P. Cranch. Sought to make it Western\r\nin spirit with many Western contributors and articles on history of\r\nthe West. 1836-1839 in Louisville, under J. F. Clarke, then back to\r\nCincinnati, under William H. Channing, till April, 1841.\r\n\r\nWESTERN MONTHLY MAGAZINE, THE (Cincinnati), 1833-1836.\r\n\r\nEdited for two and one-half years by James Hall and for six months\r\nby Joseph R. Foy. Thirty-seven contributors, of whom six were women\r\nand only three from east of the Alleghenies. Harriet Beecher won \"the\r\nprize tale\" in April, 1834, and contributed another story in July.\r\nThe contents made up largely of expository articles on art, history,\r\nbiology, travel, education, economics, and modern sociology. The book\r\nnotices were independent and discriminating.\r\n\r\nYALE REVIEW, THE, 1892-1911, 1911----. Issued quarterly.\r\n\r\nContinued _New Englander and Yale Review_. G. P. Fisher and others,\r\neditors. In 1900 changed from a \"journal of history and political\r\nscience\" to a \"Journal for the Scientific Discussion of Economic,\r\nPolitical, and Social Questions\"; 1911---- \"a quarterly magazine\r\ndevoted to Literature, Science, History, and Public Opinion.\" Yale\r\nPublishing Association, Inc., Wilbur D. Cross, chief editor. Not an\r\nofficial publication of Yale University. Made up of serious articles\r\nand essays, some light essays and verse, and literary criticism.\r\nLeading contributors, prose: W. H. Taft, Norman Angell, Walter\r\nLippman, Simeon Strunsky, Vida D. Scudder; verse: Witter Bynner, Louis\r\nUntermeyer, Sara Teasdale, Edgar Lee Masters, Robert Frost, John\r\nMasefield. Thus its place as a literary periodical has been assumed\r\nonly within the last decade. The old _New Englander_ (1843-1892) was a\r\nsubstantial and dignified journal but included the work of no writer of\r\neven minor literary achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n  \"Abraham Davenport\" (Whittier), 261\r\n\r\n  \"Acknowledgment\" (Lanier), 355, 356\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, 68, 69, 343\r\n\r\n  Addison, Joseph, 45, 47, 48, 102, 116, 123, 163, 166, 191, 254, 317,\r\n          343\r\n\r\n  \"Adios\" (Miller), 407\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, Louis, 229, 294\r\n\r\n  \"Agile Sonneteer, The\" (Sill), 401\r\n\r\n  \"Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems\" (Poe), 176\r\n\r\n  Alcott, Bronson, 195, 196\r\n\r\n  Aldrich, Thomas Bailey, 324, 327-331, 332, 411, 453\r\n\r\n  \"Alectryon\" (Stedman), 333\r\n\r\n  \"Algerine Captive, The\" (Tyler), 103\r\n\r\n  Allan, John, 174, 175, 176, 179\r\n\r\n  Allston, Washington, 313\r\n\r\n  Almanacs, colonial, 50, 51\r\n\r\n  \"American Anthology, An\" (Stedman), 332\r\n\r\n  American Anti-Slavery Society, 257, 258\r\n\r\n  \"American Claimant, The\" (Twain), 383\r\n\r\n  American deference to Old World culture, 70, 78, 79,94, 108, 111-114,\r\n          120, 121, 133, 142, 143, 152, 153, 154, 163, 168, 177, 190,\r\n          201, 204, 268, 272, 292, 333, 336, 367, 389, 419, 433, 438\r\n\r\n  American isolation, 111\r\n\r\n  \"American Literature, Library of\" (Stedman), 332\r\n\r\n  _American Magazine, The_, 487\r\n\r\n  _American Manufacturer, The_, 255\r\n\r\n  _American Monthly Magazine, The_, 239\r\n\r\n  \"American Notebooks\" (Hawthorne), 241\r\n\r\n  \"American Register, The\" (Brown), 102\r\n\r\n  \"American Scholar, The\" (Emerson), 204\r\n\r\n  \"American, The\" (James), 423\r\n\r\n  Ames, Nathaniel, 50, 51\r\n\r\n  Amesbury (Mass.), 253\r\n\r\n  \"Among my Books\" (Lowell), 289\r\n\r\n  \"Among the Redwoods\" (Sill), 399\r\n\r\n  Andover (Mass.), 22, 304\r\n\r\n  \"André\" (Dunlap), 96\r\n\r\n  Andros, Governor, 27\r\n\r\n  \"Annabel Lee\" (Poe), 179\r\n\r\n  \"Annie Kilburn\" (Howells), 419\r\n\r\n  \"Antiquity of Freedom, The\" (Whittier), 166\r\n\r\n  \"April Hopes\" (Howells), 418\r\n\r\n  _Arcturus_, 283\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Matthew, 213, 216\r\n\r\n  \"Arrow and the Song, The\" (Longfellow), 272\r\n\r\n  \"Arthur Mervyn\" (Brown), 105, 106\r\n\r\n  _Atlantic Monthly, The_, 232, 265, 267, 288, 305, 314, 317, 327, 329,\r\n          345, 381, 397, 415, 416, 478, 488\r\n\r\n  Austen, Jane, 107, 249\r\n\r\n  \"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, The\" (Holmes), 316-318\r\n\r\n  \"Autumn\" (Thoreau), 230\r\n\r\n  \"Awkward Age, The\" (James), 423\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bakst, Leon, 184\r\n\r\n  \"Ballad of Babie Bell, The\" (Aldrich), 330\r\n\r\n  \"Ballad of the Oysterman, The\" (Holmes), 315\r\n\r\n  \"Ballads and other Poems\" (Longfellow), 271\r\n\r\n  _Baltimore Saturday Visiter, The_, 176, 488\r\n\r\n  \"Barbara Frietchie\" (Whittier), 260\r\n\r\n  Barlow, Joel 65, 76, 86, 111\r\n\r\n  \"Baroness of New York, The\" (Miller), 404, 406\r\n\r\n  \"Battlefield, The\" (Whittier), 166\r\n\r\n  \"Bay Psalm Book,\" 5, 19, 21\r\n\r\n  \"Beat!
