The publication of the five volumes of General\r\nCunningham’s ‘Archæological Reports’ has thrown new light on many\r\nobscure points, but generally from an archæological rather than from an\r\narchitectural point of view; and Mr. Burgess’s researches among the\r\nwestern caves and the structural temples of the Bombay presidency have\r\nadded greatly not only to our stores of information, but to the\r\nprecision of our knowledge regarding them.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of such a work as this, however, photography has\r\nprobably done more than anything that has been written. There are now\r\nvery few buildings in India--of any importance at least--which have not\r\nbeen photographed with more or less completeness; and for purposes of\r\ncomparison such collections of photographs as are now available are\r\nsimply invaluable. For detecting similarities, or distinguishing\r\ndifferences between specimens situated at distances from one another,\r\nphotographs are almost equal to actual personal inspection, and, when\r\nsufficiently numerous, afford a picture of Indian art of the utmost\r\nimportance to anyone attempting to describe it.\r\n\r\nThese new aids, added to our previous stock of knowledge, are probably\r\nsufficient to justify us in treating the architecture of India Proper in\r\nthe quasi-exhaustive manner in which it is attempted, in the first 600\r\npages of this work. Its description might, of course, be easily extended\r\neven beyond these limits, but without plans and more accurate\r\narchitectural details than we at present possess, any such additions\r\nwould practically contribute very little that was valuable to the\r\ninformation the work already contains.\r\n\r\nThe case is different when we turn to Further India. Instead of only 150\r\npages and 50 illustrations, both these figures ought at least to be\r\ndoubled to bring that branch of the subject up to the same stage of\r\ncompleteness as that describing the architecture of India Proper. For\r\nthis, however, the materials do not at present exist. Of Japan we know\r\nalmost nothing except from photographs, without plans, dimensions, or\r\ndates; and, except as regards Pekin and the Treaty Ports, we know almost\r\nas little of China. We know a great deal about one or two buildings in\r\nCambodia and Java, but our information regarding all the rest is so\r\nfragmentary and incomplete, that it is hardly available for the purposes\r\nof a general history, and the same may be said of Burmah and Siam. Ten\r\nyears hence this deficiency may be supplied, and it may then be possible\r\nto bring the whole into harmony. At present a slight sketch indicating\r\nthe relative position of each, and their relation to the styles of India\r\nProper, is all that can well be accomplished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough appearing as the third volume of the second edition of the\r\n‘General History of Architecture,’ the present may be considered as an\r\nindependent and original work. In the last edition the Indian chapters\r\nextended only to about 300 pages, with 200 illustrations,[2] and though\r\nmost of the woodcuts reappear in the present volume, more than half the\r\noriginal text has been cancelled, and consequently at least 600 pages of\r\nthe present work are original matter, and 200 illustrations--and these\r\nby far the most important--have been added. These, with the new\r\nchronological and topographical details, present the subject to the\r\nEnglish reader in a more compact and complete form than has been\r\nattempted in any work on Indian architecture hitherto published. It does\r\nnot, as I feel only too keenly, contain all the information that could\r\nbe desired, but I am afraid it contains nearly all that the materials\r\nat present available will admit of being utilised, in a general history\r\nof the style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I published my first work on Indian architecture thirty years ago,\r\nI was reproached for making dogmatic assertions, and propounding\r\ntheories which I did not even attempt to sustain. The defect was, I am\r\nafraid, inevitable. My conclusions were based upon the examination of\r\nthe actual buildings throughout the three Presidencies of India and in\r\nChina during ten years’ residence in the East, and to have placed before\r\nthe world the multitudinous details which were the ground of my\r\ngeneralisations, would have required an additional amount of description\r\nand engravings which was not warranted by the interest felt in the\r\nsubject at that time. The numerous engravings in the present volume, the\r\nextended letterpress, and the references to works of later labourers in\r\nthe wide domain of Indian architecture, will greatly diminish, but\r\ncannot entirely remove, the old objection. No man can direct his mind\r\nfor forty years to the earnest investigation of any department of\r\nknowledge, and not become acquainted with a host of particulars, and\r\nacquire a species of insight which neither time, nor space, nor perhaps\r\nthe resources of language will permit him to reproduce in their fulness.\r\nI possess, to give a single instance, more than 3000 photographs of\r\nIndian buildings, with which constant use has made me as familiar as\r\nwith any other object that is perpetually before my eyes, and to\r\nrecapitulate all the information they convey to long-continued scrutiny,\r\nwould be an endless, if not indeed an impossible undertaking. The\r\nnecessities of the case demand that broad results should often be given\r\nwhen the evidence for the statements must be merely indicated or greatly\r\nabridged, and if the conclusions sometimes go beyond the appended\r\nproofs, I can only ask my readers to believe that the assertions are not\r\nspeculative fancies, but deductions from facts. My endeavour from the\r\nfirst has been to present a distinct view of the general principles\r\nwhich have governed the historical development of Indian architecture,\r\nand my hope is that those who pursue the subject beyond the pages of the\r\npresent work, will find that the principles I have enunciated will\r\nreduce to order the multifarious details, and that the details in turn\r\nwill confirm the principles. Though the vast amount of fresh knowledge\r\nwhich has gone on accumulating since I commenced my investigations has\r\nenabled me to correct, modify, and enlarge my views, yet the\r\nclassification I adopted, and the historical sequences I pointed out\r\nthirty years since, have in their essential outlines been confirmed, and\r\nwill continue, I trust, to stand good. Many subsidiary questions remain\r\nunsettled, but my impression is, that not a few of the discordant\r\nopinions that may be observed, arise principally from the different\r\ncourses which inquirers have pursued in their investigations. Some men\r\nof great eminence and learning, more conversant with books than\r\nbuildings, have naturally drawn their knowledge and inferences from\r\nwritten authorities, none of which are contemporaneous with the events\r\nthey relate, and all of which have been avowedly altered and falsified\r\nin later times. My authorities, on the contrary, have been mainly the\r\nimperishable records in the rocks, or on sculptures and carvings, which\r\nnecessarily represented at the time the faith and feelings of those who\r\nexecuted them, and which retain their original impress to this day. In\r\nsuch a country as India, the chisels of her sculptors are, so far as I\r\ncan judge, immeasurably more to be trusted than the pens of her authors.\r\nThese secondary points, however, may well await the solution which time\r\nand further study will doubtless supply. In the meanwhile, I shall have\r\nrealised a long-cherished dream if I have succeeded in popularising the\r\nsubject by rendering its principles generally intelligible, and can thus\r\ngive an impulse to its study, and assist in establishing Indian\r\narchitecture on a stable basis, so that it may take its true position\r\namong the other great styles which have ennobled the arts of mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe publication of this volume completes the history of the\r\n‘Architecture in all Countries, from the earliest times to the present\r\nday, in four volumes,’ and there it must at present rest. As originally\r\nprojected, it was intended to have added a fifth volume on ‘Rude Stone\r\nMonuments,’ which is still wanted to make the series quite complete;\r\nbut, as explained in the preface to my work bearing that title, the\r\nsubject was not, when it was written, ripe for a historical treatment,\r\nand the materials collected were consequently used in an argumentative\r\nessay. Since that work was published, in 1872, no serious examination of\r\nits arguments has been undertaken by any competent authority, while\r\nevery new fact that has come to light--especially in India--has served\r\nto confirm me more and more in the correctness of the principles I then\r\ntried to establish.[3] Unless, however, the matter is taken up\r\nseriously, and re-examined by those who, from their position, have the\r\near of the public in these matters, no such progress will be made as\r\nwould justify the publication of a second work on the same subject. I\r\nconsequently see no chance of my ever having an opportunity of taking up\r\nthe subject again, so as to be able to describe its objects in a more\r\nconsecutive or more exhaustive manner than was done in the work just\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buddha preaching. (From a fresco painting at Ajunta.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the great difficulties that meets every one attempting to write\r\non Indian subjects at the present day is to know how to spell Indian\r\nproper names. The Gilchristian mode of using double vowels, which was\r\nfashionable fifty years ago, has now been entirely done away with, as\r\ncontrary to the spirit of Indian orthography, though it certainly is the\r\nmode which enables the ordinary Englishman to pronounce Indian names\r\nwith the greatest readiness and certainty. On the other hand, an attempt\r\nis now being made to form out of the ordinary English alphabet a more\r\nextended one, by accents over the vowels, and dots under the consonants,\r\nand other devices, so that every letter of the Devanagari or Arabic\r\nalphabets shall have an exact equivalent in this one.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to print Sanscrit or Persian books in Roman characters,\r\nsuch a system is indispensable, but if used for printing Indian names in\r\nEnglish books, intended principally for the use of Englishmen, it seems\r\nto me to add not only immensely to the repulsiveness of the subject, but\r\nto lead to the most ludicrous mistakes. According to this alphabet for\r\ninstance, ḍ with dot under it represents a consonant we pronounce as r;\r\nbut as not one educated Englishman in 10,000 is aware of this fact, he\r\nreads such words as Kattiwaḍ, Chîtoḍ, and Himaḍpanti as if spelt\r\nliterally with a d, though they are pronounced Kattiwar, Chittore, and\r\nHimarpanti, and are so written in all books hitherto published, and the\r\ntwo first are so spelt in all maps hitherto engraved. A hundred years\r\nhence, when Sanscrit and Indian alphabets are taught in all schools in\r\nEngland, it may be otherwise, but in the present state of knowledge on\r\nthe subject some simpler plan seems more expedient.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have consequently used the Jonesian system, as\r\nnearly as may be, as it was used by Prinsep, or the late Professor\r\nWilson, but avoiding as far as possible all accents, except over vowels\r\nwhere they were necessary for the pronunciation. Over such words as\r\nNâga, Râjâ, or Hindû--as in Tree and Serpent worship--I have omitted\r\naccents altogether as wholly unnecessary for the pronunciation. An\r\naccent, however, seems indispensable over the â in Lât, to prevent it\r\nbeing read as Lath in English, as I have heard done, or over the î in\r\nsuch words as Hullabîd, to prevent its being read as short bid in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nNames of known places I have in all instances tried to leave as they are\r\nusually spelt, and are found on maps. I have, for instance, left\r\nOudeypore, the capital of the Rajput state, spelt as Tod and others\r\nalways spelt it, but, to prevent the two places being confounded, have\r\ntaken the liberty of spelling the name of a small unknown village, where\r\nthere is a temple, Udaipur--though I believe the names are the same. I\r\nhave tried, in short, to accommodate my spelling as nearly as possible\r\nto the present state of knowledge or ignorance of the English public,\r\nwithout much reference to scientific precision, as I feel sure that by\r\nthis means the nomenclature may become much less repulsive than it too\r\ngenerally must be to the ordinary English student of Indian history and\r\nart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                      Page 3\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nBUDDHIST ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Until it is forced on their attention,\r\nfew are aware how much education does to concentrate attention within a\r\nvery narrow field of observation. We become familiar in the nursery with\r\nthe names of the heroes of Greek and Roman history. In every school\r\ntheir history and their arts are taught, memorials of their greatness\r\nmeet us at every turn through life, and their thoughts and aspirations\r\nbecome, as it were, part of ourselves. So, too, with the Middle Ages:\r\ntheir religion is our religion; their architecture our architecture, and\r\ntheir history fades so insensibly into our own, that we can draw no line\r\nof demarcation that would separate us from them. How different is the\r\nstate of feeling, when from this familiar home we turn to such a country\r\nas India. Its geography is hardly taught in schools, and seldom mastered\r\nperfectly; its history is a puzzle; its literature a mythic dream; its\r\narts a quaint perplexity. But, above all, the names of its heroes and\r\ngreat men are so unfamiliar and so unpronounceable, that, except a few\r\nof those who go to India, scarcely any ever become so acquainted with\r\nthem, that they call up any memories which are either pleasing or worth\r\ndwelling upon.\r\n\r\nWere it not for this, there is probably no country--out of Europe at\r\nleast--that would so well repay attention as India. None, where all the\r\nproblems of natural science or of art are presented to us in so distinct\r\nand so pleasing a form. Nowhere does nature show herself in such grand\r\nand such luxurious features, and nowhere does humanity exist in more\r\nvaried and more pleasing conditions. Side by side with the intellectual\r\nBrahman caste, and the chivalrous Rajput, are found the wild Bhîl and\r\nthe naked Gond, not antagonistic and warring one against the other, as\r\nelsewhere, but living now as they have done for thousands of years, each\r\ncontent with his own lot, and prepared to follow, without repining, in\r\nthe footsteps of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, of course, be for one moment contended that India ever\r\nreached the intellectual supremacy of Greece, or the moral greatness of\r\nRome; but, though on a lower step of the ladder, her arts are more\r\noriginal and more varied, and her forms of civilisation present an\r\never-changing variety, such as are nowhere else to be found. What,\r\nhowever, really renders India so interesting as an object of study is\r\nthat it is now a living entity. Greece and Rome are dead and have passed\r\naway, and we are living so completely in the midst of modern Europe,\r\nthat we cannot get outside to contemplate it as a whole. But India is a\r\ncomplete cosmos in itself; bounded on the north by the Himalayas, on the\r\nsouth by the sea, on the east by impenetrable jungle, and only on the\r\nwest having one door of communication, across the Indus, open to the\r\nother world. Across that stream, nation after nation have poured their\r\nmyriads into her coveted domain, but no reflex waves ever mixed her\r\npeople with those beyond her boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all this, every problem of anthropology or ethnography\r\ncan be studied here more easily than anywhere else; every art has its\r\nliving representative, and often of the most pleasing form; every\r\nscience has its illustration, and many on a scale not easily matched\r\nelsewhere. But, notwithstanding all this, in nine cases out of ten,\r\nIndia and Indian matters fail to interest, because they are to most\r\npeople new and unfamiliar. The rudiments have not been mastered when\r\nyoung, and, when grown up, few men have the leisure or the inclination\r\nto set to work to learn the forms of a new world, demanding both care\r\nand study; and till this is attained, it can hardly be hoped that the\r\narts and the architecture of India will interest a European reader to\r\nthe same extent as those styles treated of in the previous volumes of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks, it may still be possible to present the\r\nsubject of Indian architecture in such a form as to be interesting, even\r\nif not attractive. To do this, however, the narrative form must be\r\nfollowed as far as is compatible with such a subject. All technical and\r\nunfamiliar names must be avoided wherever it is possible to do so, and\r\nthe whole accompanied with a sufficient number of illustrations to\r\nenable its forms to be mastered without difficulty. Even if this is\r\nattended to, no one volume can tell the whole of so varied and so\r\ncomplex a history. Without preliminary or subsequent study it can hardly\r\nbe expected that so new and so vast a subject can be grasped; but one\r\nvolume may contain a complete outline of the whole, and enable any one\r\nwho wishes for more information to know where to look for it, or how to\r\nappreciate it when found.\r\n\r\nWhether successful or not, it seems well worth while that an attempt\r\nshould be made to interest the public in Indian architectural art;\r\nfirst, because the artist and architect will certainly acquire broader\r\nand more varied views of their art by its study than they can acquire\r\nfrom any other source. More than this, any one who masters the subject\r\nsufficiently to be able to understand their art in its best and highest\r\nforms, will rise from the study with a kindlier feeling towards the\r\nnations of India, and a higher--certainly a correcter--appreciation of\r\ntheir social status than could be obtained from their literature, or\r\nfrom anything that now exists in their anomalous social and political\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, many may be inclined to ask, Is it worth while\r\nto master all the geographical and historical details necessary to\r\nunravel so tangled a web as this, and then try to become so familiar\r\nwith their ever-varying forms as not only to be able to discriminate\r\nbetween the different styles, but also to follow them through all their\r\nceaseless changes?\r\n\r\nMy impression is that this question may fairly be answered in the\r\naffirmative. No one has a right to say that he understands the history\r\nof architecture who leaves out of his view the works of an immense\r\nportion of the human race, which has always shown itself so capable of\r\nartistic development. But, more than this, architecture in India is\r\nstill a living art, practised on the principles which caused its\r\nwonderful development in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries; and\r\nthere, consequently, and there alone, the student of architecture has a\r\nchance of seeing the real principles of the art in action. In Europe, at\r\nthe present day, architecture is practised in a manner so anomalous and\r\nabnormal that few, if any, have hitherto been able to shake off the\r\ninfluence of a false system, and to see that the art of ornamental\r\nbuilding can be based on principles of common sense; and that, when so\r\npractised, the result not only is, but must be, satisfactory. Those who\r\nhave an opportunity of seeing what perfect buildings the ignorant\r\nuneducated natives of India are now producing, will easily understand\r\nhow success may be achieved, while those who observe what failures the\r\nbest educated and most talented architects in Europe are constantly\r\nperpetrating, may, by a study of Indian models, easily see why this must\r\ninevitably be the result. It is only in India that the two systems can\r\nnow be seen practised side by side--the educated and intellectual\r\nEuropean always failing because his principles are wrong, the feeble and\r\nuneducated native as inevitably succeeding because his principles are\r\nright. The Indian builders _think_ only of what they are doing, and how\r\nthey can best produce the effect they desire. In the European system it\r\nis considered more essential that a building, especially in its details,\r\nshould be a correct _copy_ of something else, than good in itself or\r\nappropriate to its purpose; hence the difference in the result.\r\n\r\nIn one other respect India affords a singularly favourable field to the\r\nstudent of architecture. In no other country of the same extent are\r\nthere so many distinct nationalities, each retaining its old faith and\r\nits old feelings, and impressing these on its art. There is consequently\r\nno country where the outlines of ethnology as applied to art can be so\r\neasily perceived, or their application to the elucidation of the various\r\nproblems so pre-eminently important. The mode in which the art has been\r\npractised in Europe for the last three centuries has been very\r\nconfusing. In India it is clear and intelligible. No one can look at the\r\nsubject without seeing its importance, and no one can study the art as\r\npractised there without recognising what the principles of the science\r\nreally are.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to these scientific advantages, it will\r\nundoubtedly be conceded by those who are familiar with the subject that\r\nfor certain qualities the Indian buildings are unrivalled. They display\r\nan exuberance of fancy, a lavishness of labour, and an elaboration of\r\ndetail to be found nowhere else. They may contain nothing so sublime as\r\nthe hall at Karnac, nothing so intellectual as the Parthenon, nor so\r\nconstructively grand as a mediæval cathedral; but for certain other\r\nqualities--not perhaps of the highest kind, yet very important in\r\narchitectural art--the Indian buildings stand alone. They consequently\r\nfill up a great gap in our knowledge of the subject, which without them\r\nwould remain a void.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties that exist--perhaps the greatest--in\r\nexciting an interest in Indian antiquities arises from the fact, that\r\nIndia has no history properly so called, before the Mahomedan invasion\r\nin the 13th century. Had India been a great united kingdom, like China,\r\nwith a long line of dynasties and well-recorded dates attached to them,\r\nthe task would have been comparatively easy; but nothing of the sort\r\nexists or ever existed within her boundaries. On the contrary, so far as\r\nour knowledge extends, India has always been occupied by three or four\r\ndifferent races of mankind, who have never amalgamated so as to become\r\none people, and each of these races have been again subdivided into\r\nnumerous tribes or small nationalities nearly, sometimes wholly,\r\nindependent of each other--and, what is worse than all, not one of them\r\never kept a chronicle or preserved a series of dates commencing from any\r\nwell-known era.[4]\r\n\r\nThe absence of any historical record is the more striking, because India\r\npossesses a written literature equal to, if not surpassing in variety\r\nand extent, that possessed by any other nation, before the invention, or\r\nat least before the adoption and use, of printing. The Vedas themselves,\r\nwith their Upanishads and Brahmanas, and the commentaries on them, form\r\na literature in themselves of vast extent, and some parts of which are\r\nas old, possibly older, than any written works that are now known to\r\nexist; and the Puranas, though comparatively modern, make up a body of\r\ndoctrine mixed with mythology and tradition such as few nations can\r\nboast of. Besides this, however, are two great epics, surpassing in\r\nextent, if not in merit, those of any ancient nation, and a drama of\r\ngreat beauty, written at periods extending through a long series of\r\nyears. In addition to those we have treatises on law, on grammar, on\r\nastronomy, on metaphysics and mathematics, on almost every branch of\r\nmental science--a literature extending in fact to some 10,000 or 11,000\r\nworks, but in all this not one book that can be called historical. No\r\nman in India, so far as is known, ever thought of recording the events\r\nof his own life or of repeating the previous experience of others, and\r\nit was only at some time subsequent to the Christian Era that they ever\r\nthought of establishing eras from which to date deeds or events.\r\n\r\nAll this is the more curious because in Ceylon we have, in the\r\n‘Mahawanso,’ and other books of a like nature, a consecutive history of\r\nthat island, with dates which may be depended upon within very narrow\r\nlimits of error, for periods extending from B.C. 250 to the present\r\ntime. At the other extremity of India, we have also in the Raja\r\nTarangini of Kashmir, a work which Professor Wilson characterised as\r\n“the only Sanscrit composition yet discovered to which the title of\r\nHistory can with any propriety be applied.”[5] As we at present,\r\nhowever, possess it, it hardly helps us to any historical data earlier\r\nthan the Christian Era, and even after that its dates for some centuries\r\nare by no means fixed and certain.\r\n\r\nIn India Proper, however, we have no such guides as even these, but for\r\nwritten history are almost wholly dependent on the Puranas. They do\r\nfurnish us with one list of kings’ names, with the length of their\r\nreigns, so apparently truthful that they may, within narrow limits,\r\nbe depended upon. They are only, however, of one range of\r\ndynasties--probably, however, the paramount one--and extend only from\r\nthe accession of Chandragupta--the Sandrocottus of the Greeks--B.C. 325,\r\nto the decline of the Andra dynasty, about A.D. 400 or 408. It seems\r\nprobable we may find sufficient confirmation of these lists as far back\r\nas the Anjana era, B.C. 691, so as to include the period marked by the\r\nlife and labours of Sakya Muni--the present Buddha--in our chronology,\r\nwith tolerable certainty. All the chronology before that period is\r\npurposely and avowedly falsified by the introduction of the system of\r\nYugs, in order to carry back the origin of the Brahmanical system into\r\nthe regions of the most fabulous antiquity. From the 5th century\r\nonwards, when the Puranas began to be put into their present form, in\r\nconsequence of the revival of the Brahmanical religion, instead of\r\nrecording contemporary events, they purposely confused them so as to\r\nmaintain their prophetic character, and prevent the detection of the\r\nfalsehood of their claim to an antiquity equal to that of the Vedas. For\r\nIndian history after the 5th century we are consequently left mainly to\r\ninscriptions on monuments or on copper-plates, to coins, and to the\r\nworks of foreigners for the necessary information with which the natives\r\nof the country itself have neglected to supply us. These probably will\r\nbe found eventually to be at least sufficient for the purposes of\r\nchronology. Already such progress has been made in the decipherment of\r\ninscriptions and the arrangement of coins, that all the dynasties may be\r\narranged consecutively, and even the date of the reigns of almost all\r\nthe kings in the north of India have been already approximately\r\nascertained. In the south of India so much has not been done, but this\r\nis more because there have been fewer labourers in the field than from\r\nwant of materials. There are literally thousands of inscriptions in the\r\nsouth which have not been copied, and of the few that have been\r\ncollected only a very small number have been translated; but they are\r\nsuch as to give us hope that, when the requisite amount of labour is\r\nbestowed upon them, we shall be able to fix the chronology of the kings\r\nof the south with a degree of certainty sufficient for all ordinary\r\npurposes.[6]\r\n\r\nIt is a far more difficult task to ascertain whether we shall ever\r\nrecover the History of India before the time of the advent of Buddha, or\r\nbefore the Anjana epoch, B.C. 691. Here we certainly will find no coins\r\nor inscriptions to guide us, and no buildings to illustrate the arts, or\r\nto mark the position of cities, while all ethnographic traces have\r\nbecome so blurred, if not obliterated, that they serve us little as\r\nguides through the labyrinth. Yet on the other hand there is so large a\r\nmass of literature--such as it is--bearing on the subject, that we\r\ncannot but hope that, when a sufficient amount of learning is brought to\r\nbear upon it, the leading features of the history of even that period\r\nmay be recovered. In order, however, to render it available, it will not\r\nrequire industry so much as a severe spirit of criticism to winnow the\r\nfew grains of useful truth out of the mass of worthless chaff this\r\nliterature contains. But it does not seem too much to expect even this,\r\nfrom the severely critical spirit of the age. Meanwhile, the main facts\r\nof the case seem to be nearly as follows, in so far as it is necessary\r\nto state them, in order to make what follows intelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nARYANS.\r\n\r\nAt some very remote period in the world’s history--for reasons stated in\r\nthe Appendix I believe it to have been at about the epoch called by the\r\nHindus the Kali Yug, or B.C. 3101--the Aryans, a Sanscrit-speaking\r\npeople, entered India across the Upper Indus, coming from Central Asia.\r\nFor a long time they remained settled in the Punjab, or on the banks of\r\nthe Sarasvati, then a more important stream than now, the main body,\r\nhowever, still remaining to the westward of the Indus. If, however, we\r\nmay trust our chronology, we find them settled 2000 years before the\r\nChristian Era, in Ayodhya, and then in the plenitude of their power. It\r\nwas about that time apparently that the event took place which formed\r\nthe groundwork of the far more modern poem known as the ‘Ramayana.’ The\r\npure Aryans, still uncontaminated by admixture with the blood of the\r\nnatives, then seem to have attained the height of their prosperity in\r\nIndia, and to have carried their victorious arms, it may be, as far\r\nsouth as Ceylon. There is, however, no reason to suppose that they at\r\nthat time formed any permanent settlements in the Deccan, but it was at\r\nall events opened to their missionaries, and by slow degrees imbibed\r\nthat amount of Brahmanism which eventually pervaded the whole of the\r\nsouth. Seven or eight hundred years after that time, or it may be about\r\nor before B.C. 1200, took place those events which form the theme of the\r\nmore ancient epic known as the ‘Mahabharata,’ which opens up an entirely\r\nnew view of Indian social life. If the heroes of that poem were Aryans\r\nat all, they were of a much less pure type than those who composed the\r\nsongs of the Vedas, or are depicted in the verses of the ‘Ramayana.’\r\nTheir polyandry, their drinking bouts, their gambling tastes, and love\r\nof fighting, mark them as a very different race from the peaceful\r\nshepherd immigrants of the earlier age, and point much more distinctly\r\ntowards a Tartar, trans-Himalayan origin, than to the cradle of the\r\nAryan stock in Central Asia. As if to mark the difference of which they\r\nthemselves felt the existence, they distinguished themselves, by name,\r\nas belonging to a Lunar race, distinct from, and generally antagonistic\r\nto, the Solar race, which was the proud distinction of the purer and\r\nearlier Aryan settlers in India.\r\n\r\nFive or six hundred years after this, or about B.C. 700, we again find a\r\ntotally different state of affairs in India. The Aryans no longer exist\r\nas a separate nationality, and neither the Solar nor the Lunar race are\r\nthe rulers of the earth. The Brahmans have become a priestly caste, and\r\nshare the power with the Kshatriyas, a race of far less purity of\r\ndescent. The Vaisyas, as merchants and husbandmen, have become a power,\r\nand even the Sudras are acknowledged as a part of the body politic; and,\r\nthough not mentioned in the Scriptures, the Nagas, or Snake people, had\r\nbecome a most influential part of the population. They are first\r\nmentioned in the ‘Mahabharata,’ where they play a most important part in\r\ncausing the death of Parikshit, which led to the great sacrifice for the\r\ndestruction of the Nagas by Janemajaya, which practically closes the\r\nhistory of the time. Destroyed, however, they were not, as it was under\r\na Naga dynasty that ascended the throne of Magadha, in 691, that Buddha\r\nwas born, B.C. 623, and the Nagas were the people whose conversion\r\nplaced Buddhism on a secure basis in India, and led to its ultimate\r\nadoption by Asoka (B.C. 250) as the religion of the State.[7]\r\n\r\nAlthough Buddhism was first taught by a prince of the Solar race, and\r\nconsequently of purely Aryan blood, and though its first disciples were\r\nBrahmans, it had as little affinity with the religion of the Vedas as\r\nChristianity had with the Pentateuch, and its fate was the same. The one\r\nreligion was taught by one of Jewish extraction to the Jews and for the\r\nJews; but it was ultimately rejected by them, and adopted by the\r\nGentiles, who had no affinity of race or religion with the inhabitants\r\nof Judæa. Though meant originally, no doubt, for Aryans, the Buddhist\r\nreligion was ultimately rejected by the Brahmans, who were consequently\r\nutterly eclipsed and superseded by it for nearly a thousand years; and\r\nwe hear little or nothing of them and their religion till they\r\nreappeared at the court of the great Vicramaditya (490-530), when their\r\nreligion began to assume that strange shape which it now still retains\r\nin India. In its new form it is as unlike the pure religion of the Vedas\r\nas it is possible to conceive one religion being to another; unlike\r\nthat, also, of the older portions of the ‘Mahabharata’; but a confused\r\nmess of local superstitions and imported myths, covering up and hiding\r\nthe Vedantic and Buddhist doctrines, which may sometimes be detected as\r\nunderlying it. Whatever it be, however, it cannot be the religion of an\r\nAryan, or even of a purely Turanian people, because it was invented by\r\nand for as mixed a population as probably were ever gathered together\r\ninto one country--a people whose feelings and superstitions it only too\r\ntruly represents.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAVIDIANS.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, as was hinted above, there might be no great\r\ndifficulty in recovering all the main incidents and leading features of\r\nthe history of the Aryans, from their first entry into India till they\r\nwere entirely absorbed into the mass of the population some time before\r\nthe Christian Era, there could be no greater mistake than to suppose\r\nthat their history would fully represent the ancient history of the\r\ncountry. The Dravidians are a people who, in historical times, seem to\r\nhave been probably as numerous as the pure Aryans, and at the present\r\nday form one-fifth of the whole population of India. As Turanians, which\r\nthey seem certainly to be, they belong, it is true, to a lower\r\nintellectual status than the Aryans, but they have preserved their\r\nnationality pure and unmixed, and, such as they were at the dawn of\r\nhistory, so they seem to be now.\r\n\r\nTheir settlement in India extends to such remote pre-historic times,\r\nthat we cannot feel even sure that we should regard them as immigrants,\r\nor, at least, as either conquerors or colonists on a large scale, but\r\nrather as aboriginal in the sense in which that term is usually\r\nunderstood. Generally it is assumed that they entered India across the\r\nLower Indus, leaving the cognate Brahui in Belochistan as a mark of the\r\nroad by which they came, and, as the affinities of their language seem\r\nto be with the Ugrians and northern Turanian tongues, this view seems\r\nprobable.[8] But they have certainly left no trace of their migrations\r\nanywhere between the Indus and the Nerbudda, and all the facts of their\r\nhistory, so far as they are known, would seem to lead to an opposite\r\nconclusion. The hypothesis that would represent what we know of their\r\nhistory most correctly would place their original seat in the extreme\r\nsouth, somewhere probably not far from Madura or Tanjore, and thence\r\nspreading fan-like towards the north, till they met the Aryans on the\r\nVindhya Mountains. The question, again, is not of much importance for\r\nour present purposes, as they do not seem to have reached that degree of\r\ncivilisation at any period anterior to the Christian Era which would\r\nenable them to practise any of the arts of civilised life with success,\r\nso as to bring them within the scope of a work devoted to the history of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIt may be that at some future period, when we know more of the ancient\r\narts of these Dravidians than we now do, and have become familiar with\r\nthe remains of the Accadians or early Turanian inhabitants of\r\nBabylonia, we may detect affinities which may throw some light on this\r\nvery obscure part of history. At present, however, the indications are\r\nmuch too hazy to be at all relied upon. Geographically, however, one\r\nthing seems tolerably clear. If the Dravidians came into India in\r\nhistorical times, it was not from Central Asia that they migrated, but\r\nfrom Babylonia, or some such southern region of the Asiatic continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDASYUS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two great distinct and opposite nationalities,\r\nthere exists in India a third, which, in pre-Buddhist times, was as\r\nnumerous, perhaps even more so, than either the Aryans or Dravidians,\r\nbut of whose history we know even less than we do of the two others.\r\nEthnologists have not yet been even able to agree on a name by which to\r\ncall them. I have suggested Dasyus,[9] a slave people, as that is the\r\nname by which the Aryans designated them when they found them there on\r\ntheir first entrance into India, and subjected them to their sway.\r\nWhoever they were, they seem to have been a people of a very inferior\r\nintellectual capacity to either the Aryans or Dravidians, and it is by\r\nno means clear that they could ever of themselves have risen to such a\r\nstatus as either to form a great community capable of governing\r\nthemselves, and consequently having a history,[10] or whether they must\r\nalways have remained in the low and barbarous position in which we now\r\nfind some of their branches. When the Aryans first entered India they\r\nseem to have found them occupying the whole valley of the Ganges--the\r\nwhole country in fact between the Vindhya and the Himalayan\r\nMountains.[11] At present they are only found in anything like purity in\r\nthe mountain ranges that bound that great plain. There they are known as\r\nBhîls, Coles, Sontals, Nagas, and other mountains tribes. But they\r\ncertainly form the lowest underlying stratum of the population over the\r\nwhole of the Gangetic plain.[12] So far as their affinities have been\r\nascertained, they are with the trans-Himalayan population, and it\r\neither is that they entered India through the passes of that great\r\nmountain range, or it might be more correct to say that the Thibetans\r\nare a fragment of a great population that occupied both the northern and\r\nsouthern slope of that great chain of hills at some very remote\r\npre-historic time.\r\n\r\nWhoever they were, they were the people who, in remote times, were\r\napparently the worshippers of Trees and Serpents; but what interests us\r\nmore in them, and makes the inquiry into their history more desirable,\r\nis that they were the people who first adopted Buddhism in India, and\r\nthey, or their congeners, are the only people who, in historic times, as\r\nnow, adhered, or still adhere to, that form of faith. No purely Aryan\r\npeople ever were, or ever could be, Buddhist, nor, so far as I know,\r\nwere any Dravidian community ever converted to that faith. But in\r\nBengal, in Ceylon, in Thibet, Burmah, Siam, and China, wherever a\r\nThibetan people exists, or a people allied to them, there Buddhism\r\nflourished and now prevails. But in India the Dravidians resisted it in\r\nthe south, and a revival of Aryanism abolished it in the north.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, there is no difficulty in defining the limits of the\r\nDasyu province: wherever a square tower-like temple exists with a\r\nperpendicular base, but a curvilinear outline above, such as that shown\r\nin the woodcut on the following page, there we may feel certain of the\r\nexistence, past or present, of a people of Dasyu extraction, retaining\r\ntheir purity very nearly in the direct ratio to the number of these\r\ntemples found in the district. Were it not consequently for the\r\ndifficulty of introducing new names and obtaining acceptance to what is\r\nunfamiliar, the proper names for the style prevailing in northern India\r\nwould be Dasyu style, instead of Indo-Aryan or Dasyu-Aryan which I have\r\nfelt constrained to adopt. No one can accuse the pure Aryans of\r\nintroducing this form in India, or of building temples at all, or of\r\nworshipping images of Siva or Vishnu, with which these temples are\r\nfilled, and they consequently have little title to confer their name on\r\nthe style. The Aryans had, however, become so impure in blood before\r\nthese temples were erected, and were so mixed up with the Dasyus, and\r\nhad so influenced their religion and the arts, that it may be better to\r\nretain a name which sounds familiar, and does not too sharply prejudge\r\nthe question. Be this as it may, one thing seems tolerably clear, that\r\nthe regions occupied by the Aryans in India were conterminous with those\r\nof the Dasyus, or, in other words, that the Aryans conquered the whole\r\nof the aboriginal or native tribes who occupied the plains of northern\r\nIndia, and ruled over them to such an extent as materially to influence\r\ntheir religion and their arts, and also very materially to modify even\r\ntheir language. So much so, indeed, that after some four or five\r\nthousand years of domination we should not be surprised if we have some\r\ndifficulty in recovering traces of the original population, and could\r\nprobably not do so, if some fragments of the people had not sought\r\nrefuge in the hills on the north and south of the great Gangetic plain,\r\nand there have remained fossilised, or at least sufficiently permanent\r\nfor purposes of investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hindu Temple, Bancorah.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSISUNAGA DYNASTY, B.C. 691 TO 325.\r\n\r\nLeaving these, which must, for the present at least, be considered as\r\npractically pre-historic times, we tread on surer ground when we\r\napproach the period when Buddha was born, and devoted his life to rescue\r\nman from sin and suffering. There seems very little reason for doubting\r\nthat he was born in the year 623, in the reign of Bimbasara, the fifth\r\nking of this dynasty, and died B.C. 543, at the age of eighty years, in\r\nthe eighth year of Ajattasatru, the eighth king. New sources of\r\ninformation are opening out so rapidly regarding these times, that there\r\nseems little doubt we shall before long be able to recover a perfectly\r\nauthentic account of the political events of that period, and as perfect\r\na picture of the manners and the customs of those days. It is too true,\r\nhowever, that those who wrote the biography of Buddha in subsequent\r\nages so overlaid the simple narrative of his life with fables and\r\nabsurdities, that it is now difficult to separate the wheat from the\r\nchaff; but we have sculptures extending back to within three centuries\r\nof his death, at which time we may fairly assume that a purer tradition\r\nand correcter version of the Scriptures must have prevailed. From what\r\nhas recently occurred, we may hope to creep even further back than this,\r\nand eventually to find early illustrations which will enable us to\r\nexercise so sound a criticism on the books as to enable us to restore\r\nthe life of Buddha to such an extent, as to place it among the authentic\r\nrecords of the benefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\nImmense progress has been made during the last thirty or forty years in\r\ninvestigating the origin of Buddhism, and the propagation of its\r\ndoctrines in India, and in communicating the knowledge so gained to the\r\npublic in Europe. Much, however, remains to be done before the story is\r\ncomplete, and divested of all the absurdities which subsequent\r\ncommentators have heaped upon it; and more must yet be effected before\r\nthe public can be rendered familiar with what is so essentially novel to\r\nthem. Still, the leading events in the life of the founder of the\r\nreligion are simple, and sufficiently well ascertained for all practical\r\npurposes.[13]\r\n\r\nThe founder of this religion was one of the last of a long line of\r\nkings, known as the Solar dynasties, who, from a period shortly\r\nsubsequent to the advent of the Aryans into India, had held paramount\r\nsway in Ayodhya--the modern Oude. About the 12th or 13th century B.C.\r\nthey were superseded by another race of much less purely Aryan blood,\r\nknown as the Lunar race, who transferred the seat of power to capitals\r\nsituated in the northern parts of the Doab. In consequence of this, the\r\nlineal descendants of the Solar kings were reduced to a petty\r\nprincipality at the foot of the Himalayas, where Sakya Muni was born\r\nabout 623 B.C. For twenty-nine years he enjoyed the pleasures, and\r\nfollowed the occupations, usual to the men of his rank and position; but\r\nat that age, becoming painfully impressed by the misery incident to\r\nhuman existence, he determined to devote the rest of his life to an\r\nattempt to alleviate it. For this purpose he forsook his parents and\r\nwife, abandoned friends and all the advantages of his position, and, for\r\nthe following fifty-one years, devoted himself steadily to the task he\r\nhad set before himself. Years were spent in the meditation and\r\nmortification necessary to fit himself for his mission; the rest of his\r\nlong life was devoted to wandering from city to city, teaching and\r\npreaching, and doing everything that gentle means could effect to\r\ndisseminate the doctrines which he believed were to regenerate the\r\nworld, and take the sting out of human misery.\r\n\r\nHe died, or, in the phraseology of his followers, obtained Nirvana--was\r\nabsorbed into the deity--at Kusinara, in northern Behar, in the 80th\r\nyear of his age, 543 years[14] B.C.\r\n\r\nWith the information that is now fast accumulating around the subject,\r\nthere seems no great difficulty in understanding why the mission of\r\nSakya Muni was so successful as it proved to be. He was born at a time\r\nwhen the purity of the Aryan races in India had become so deteriorated\r\nby the constant influx of less pure tribes from the north and west, that\r\ntheir power, and consequently their influence, was fast fading away. At\r\nthat time, too, it seems that the native races had, from long\r\nfamiliarity with the Aryans, acquired such a degree of civilisation as\r\nled them to desire something like equality with their masters, who were\r\nprobably always in a numerical minority in most parts of the valley of\r\nthe Ganges. In such a condition of things the preacher was sure of a\r\nwilling audience who proclaimed the abolition of caste, and taught that\r\nall men, of whatever nation or degree, had an equal chance of reaching\r\nhappiness, and ultimately heaven, by the practice of virtue, and by that\r\nonly. The subject races--the Turanian Dasyus--hailed him as a deliverer,\r\nand it was by them that the religion was adopted and proclaimed, and\r\nthat of the Aryan Brahmans was for a time obliterated, or at least\r\novershadowed and obscured.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means clear how far Buddha was successful in converting the\r\nmultitude to his doctrines during his lifetime. At his death, the first\r\nsynod was held at Rajagriha, and five hundred monks of a superior order,\r\nit is said, were assembled there on that occasion,[15] and if so they\r\nmust have represented a great multitude. But the accounts of this, and\r\nof the second convocation, held 100 years afterwards at Vaisali, on the\r\nGunduck, have not yet had the full light of recent investigation brought\r\nto bear upon them. Indeed the whole annals of the Naga dynasty, from the\r\ndeath of Buddha, B.C. 543, to the accession of Chandragupta, 325, are\r\nabout the least satisfactory of the period. Those of Ceylon were\r\npurposely falsified in order to carry back the landing of Vyjya, the\r\nfirst conqueror from Kalinga, to a period coincident with the date of\r\nBuddha’s death, while a period apparently of sixty years at least\r\nelapsed between the two events. All this may, however, be safely left to\r\nfuture explorers. We have annals and coins,[16] and we may recover\r\ninscriptions and sculptures belonging to this period, and, though it is\r\nmost improbable we shall recover any architectural remains, there are\r\nevidently materials existing which, when utilised, may suffice for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe kings of this dynasty seem to have been considered as of a low\r\ncaste, and were not, consequently, in favour either with the Brahman or,\r\nat that time, with the Buddhist; and no events which seem to have been\r\nthought worthy of being remembered, except the second convocation, are\r\nrecorded as happening in their reigns, after the death of the great\r\nAscetic--or, at all events, of being recorded in such annals as we\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURYA DYNASTY, B.C. 325 TO 188.\r\n\r\nThe case was widely different with the Maurya dynasty, which was\r\ncertainly one of the most brilliant, and is fortunately one of the best\r\nknown, of the ancient dynasties of India. The first king was\r\nChandragupta, the Sandrocottus of the Greeks, to whom Megasthenes was\r\nsent as ambassador by Seleucus, the successor of Alexander in the\r\nwestern parts of his Asiatic empire. It is from his narrative--now\r\nunfortunately lost--that the Greeks acquired almost all the knowledge\r\nthey possessed of India at that period. The country was then divided\r\ninto 120 smaller principalities, but the Maurya residing in\r\nPalibothra--the modern Patna--seems to have exercised a paramount sway\r\nover the whole. It was not, however, this king, but his grandson, the\r\ngreat Asoka (B.C. 272 to 236), who raised this dynasty to its highest\r\npitch of prosperity and power. Though utterly unknown to the Greeks, we\r\nhave from native sources a more complete picture of the incidents of his\r\nreign than of any ancient sovereign of India. The great event that made\r\nhim famous in Buddhist history was his conversion to that faith, and the\r\nzeal he showed in propagating the doctrines of his new religion. He\r\ndid, in fact, for Buddhism, exactly what Constantine did for\r\nChristianity, and at about the same distance of time from the death of\r\nthe founder of the faith. From a struggling sect he made it the religion\r\nof the State, and established it on the basis on which it lasted supreme\r\nfor nearly 1000 years. In order to render his subjects familiar with the\r\ndoctrines of his new faith, he caused a series of edicts embodying them\r\nto be engraved on rocks near Peshawur, in Gujerat, in the valley of the\r\nDhoon under the Himalayas, in Cuttack, and in several intermediate\r\nplaces. He held the third and greatest convocation of the faithful in\r\nhis capital at Patna, and, on its dissolution, sent missionaries to\r\nspread the faith in the Yavana country, whose capital was Alexandria,\r\nnear the present city of Cabul. Others were despatched to Kashmir and\r\nGandhara; one was sent to the Himawanta--the valleys of the Himalaya,\r\nand possibly part of Thibet; others were despatched to the Maharatta\r\ncountry, and to three other places in Central and Western India which\r\nhave not yet been identified with certainty. Two missionaries were sent\r\nto the Souverna Bhumi, a place now known as Thatun on the Sitang river,\r\nin Pegu, and his own son and daughter were deputed to Ceylon.[17] All\r\nthose countries, in fact, which might be called foreign, but which were\r\ninhabited by races who might in any way be supposed to be allied to the\r\nDasyus of Bengal, were then sought to be converted to the faith. He also\r\nformed alliances with Antiochus the Great, Antigonus, and with Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, and Magas of Cyrene, for the establishment of hospitals\r\nand the protection of his co-religionists in their countries. More than\r\nall this, he built innumerable topes and monasteries all over the\r\ncountry; and, though none of those now existing can positively be\r\nidentified as those actually built by him, there seems no reason\r\nwhatever for doubting that the sculptured rails at Buddh Gaya and\r\nBharhut, the caves at Bharabar in Behar, some of those at Udyagiri in\r\nCuttack, and the oldest of those in the Western Ghâts were all erected\r\nor excavated during the existence of this dynasty, if not by him\r\nhimself. These, with inscriptions and coins, and such histories as\r\nexist, make up a mass of materials for a picture of India during this\r\ndynasty such as no other can present; and, above all, they offer a\r\ncomplete representation of the religious forms and beliefs of the kings\r\nand people, which render any mistake regarding them impossible. It was\r\nBuddhism, but without a personal Buddha, and with Tree and Serpent\r\nworship cropping up in every unexpected corner.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no dynasty in the whole range of ancient Indian\r\nhistory that would better repay the labour of an exhaustive\r\ninvestigation than that of these Maurya kings. Not only were they the\r\nfirst in historical times who, so far as we know, united the whole of\r\nIndia into one great kingdom, but they were practically the first who\r\ncame in contact with European civilisation and Western politics. More\r\nthan even this, it is probably owing to the action of the third king of\r\nthis dynasty that Buddhism, from being the religion of an obscure sect,\r\nbecame, at one time, the faith of a third of the human race, and has\r\ninfluenced the belief and the moral feelings of a greater number of men\r\nthan any other religion that can be named.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the materials for such a monograph as is required are\r\nabundant, and every day is adding to them. It is to this dynasty, and to\r\nit only, that must be applied all those passages in classical authors\r\nwhich describe the internal state of India, and they are neither few nor\r\ninsignificant. Though the Hindus themselves cannot be said to have\r\ncontributed much history, they have given us, in the ‘Mudra\r\nRakshasa,’[18] a poetical version of the causes of the revolution that\r\nplaced the Mauryas on the throne. But, putting these aside, their own\r\ninscriptions give us dates, and a perfectly authentic contemporary\r\naccount of the religious faith and feelings of the period; while the\r\nnumerous bas-reliefs of the rails at Buddh Gaya and Bharhut afford a\r\npicture of the manners, customs, and costumes of the day, and a gauge by\r\nwhich we can measure their artistic status and judge how far their art\r\nwas indigenous, how far influenced by foreign elements. The dates of the\r\nkings of this dynasty are also perfectly well known,[19] and the whole\r\nframework of their history depends so completely on contemporary native\r\nmonuments, that there need be no real uncertainty regarding any of the\r\noutlines of the picture when once the subject is fairly grasped and\r\nthoroughly handled.\r\n\r\nIt is the firmest standpoint we have from which to judge of Indian\r\ncivilisation and history, whether looking to the past or to the future,\r\nand it is one that gives a very high idea of the position at which the\r\nHindus had arrived before they came practically into contact with the\r\ncivilisation of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SUNGA DYNASTY, B.C. 188 TO 76.\r\n                     KANWA DYNASTY, B.C. 76 TO 31.\r\n\r\nHistory affords us little beyond the dates of the kings’ reigns for the\r\nnext two dynasties, but there seems no reason to doubt the general\r\ncorrectness with which these are recorded in the Puranas, and by degrees\r\nwe are collecting inscriptions and finding caves that certainly belong\r\nto their time, so that we may hope to breathe life into what has\r\nhitherto appeared only a dry list of names. Such inscriptions as bear\r\ntheir names have yet only been discovered on the western caves at Karli,\r\nNassick, and similar places, but there seems no reason for doubting that\r\nthey reigned also in Magadha, and, if so, over Orissa, so that we may\r\nlook for further information regarding them on the eastern as well as on\r\nthe western side of India. These dynasties were not, however, apparently\r\nknown to the Greeks, and, being Buddhist, are passed over in comparative\r\nsilence in the Puranas. It is thus only from their monuments that we can\r\nhope to recover their history. Up to the present time, those identified\r\nas belonging to them are few and far between, but they have not yet been\r\nsystematically searched for, and till this is done there is no reason to\r\ndespair of ultimate success.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDRA DYNASTY, B.C. 31 TO A.D. 429.\r\n\r\nThe dynasty that succeeded to these Rois fainéants is--after the\r\nMauryas--the most important of all those about this period of Indian\r\nhistory. To the classical authors they are known as the Andræ, in the\r\nPuranas as Andrabrityas, and in the inscriptions as Satakarnis or\r\nSatavahanas; but under whatever name, notwithstanding occasional periods\r\nof depression, they played a most important part in the history of\r\nIndia, during more than four centuries and a half. Latterly they have\r\nbeen very much overlooked in consequence of their leaving no coins\r\nbehind them, while it is from numismatic researches, principally, that\r\nprecision has been given to much of the history of the period. The\r\ndynasties in India, however, who practically introduced coinage within\r\nher limits, all came across the Indus as strangers bringing with them an\r\nart they had learnt from the Bactrians, or those who succeeded them in\r\nthe north-west. The Andras, being a native dynasty of Central India, had\r\nno coinage of importance, and have consequently no place in these\r\nnumismatic researches; they have, however, left many and most\r\ninteresting inscriptions in the western caves, and traces of their\r\nexistence occur in many parts of India.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, their history begins with the gateways of the Tope at\r\nSanchi; the southern or oldest of these was almost certainly erected\r\nduring the reign of the first Satakarni in the first quarter of the 1st\r\ncentury--while Christ was teaching at Jerusalem--and the other three in\r\nthe course of that century. It ends with the completion of the rail at\r\nAmravati, which with almost equal certainty was commenced in the first\r\nquarter of the 4th century, and completed about A.D. 450.[20]\r\n\r\nBetween these two monuments there is no great difficulty in filling up\r\nthe architectural picture from the caves, at Nassick and Ajunta, and\r\nother places in western India, and more materials will no doubt\r\neventually be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe history of this dynasty is more than usually interesting for our\r\npurposes, as it embraces nearly the whole period during which Buddhism\r\nreigned almost supreme in India. It became the state religion, it is\r\ntrue, two centuries earlier under Asoka, but there is no reason for\r\nbelieving that the Vedic religion or Brahmanism vanished immediately.\r\nDuring the first four centuries, however, of the Christian Era we have\r\nnot a trace of a Hindu building or cave, and, so far as any material\r\nevidence goes, it seems that Buddhism at the time was the religion of\r\nthe land. It cannot, of course, be supposed that the Hindu faith was\r\nwholly obliterated, but it certainly was dormant, and in abeyance, and,\r\nto use a Buddhist expression, the yellow robes shone over the length and\r\nbreadth of the land.\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of these Andras, though not by them, that the\r\nfourth convocation was held by Kanishka, in the north of India, and the\r\nnew doctrine, the Mahayana, introduced by Nagárjuna--a change similar to\r\nthat made by Gregory the Great when he established the Church, as\r\nopposed to the primitive forms of Christianity, at about the same\r\ndistance of time from the death of the founder of the religion. My\r\nimpression is, that this convocation was held in the last quarter of the\r\nfirst century of our era, probably 79. Certain at least it is, that it\r\nwas about that time that Buddhism was first practically introduced into\r\nChina, Thibet, and Burmah, and apparently by missionaries sent out from\r\nthis as they were from the third convocation.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of the reign of the Andras that Fa Hian visited\r\nIndia (A.D. 400). As his objects in doing so were entirely of a\r\nreligious nature, he does not allude to worldly politics, nor give us a\r\nking’s name we can identify; but the picture we gather from his\r\nnarrative is one of peace and prosperity in so far as the country is\r\nconcerned, and of supremacy for his religion. Heretics are, it is true,\r\nmentioned occasionally, but they are few and far between. Buddhism was\r\nthen certainly the religion of the north, especially in the north-west\r\nof India; but even then there were symptoms of a change, in the central\r\nprovinces and outlying parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GUPTAS, 319 TO 465.\r\n                      BALLABHIS, 465 TO 712 (?).\r\n\r\nAt the time when Fa Hian was visiting the sacred places in India, the\r\npower of the Andra dynasty was passing away. It had culminated with\r\nGautamiputra (312 to 333), and they were fast sinking into a\r\nsecond-class position among Indian princes. The dynasty that superseded\r\nthem was that of the Guptas, who, at the end of the fourth century of\r\nour era, seem to have attained to the position of lords paramount in\r\nnorthern India. They date their inscriptions, which are numerous and\r\ninteresting, from an era established by the Andra king Gautamiputra,\r\nfour cycles of 60 years each, or 240 years after the Saka era of A.D.\r\n79, or in 319; but it was not apparently till under the third king,\r\nSamudra, about 380, that they really obtained the empire of northern\r\nIndia, which they retained till the death of Skandagupta, about the year\r\n465, or it may be a little later.\r\n\r\nIt is during their reign that we first perceive in high places the germs\r\nof that change which was gradually creeping over the religious system of\r\nIndia. That the Guptas were patrons of Buddhism is evident from the\r\ngifts Chandragupta II. made to the tope at Sanchi in the year 400, and\r\nrecorded on the rail of that Monument, but their other inscriptions, on\r\nthe lâts at Allahabad and Bhitari, show a decided tendency towards\r\nHinduism, but a class of Hinduism which was still far removed from the\r\nwild extravagances of the Puranas. There seems little doubt that the\r\nboar at Erun, and the buildings there, belong to this dynasty, and are\r\nconsequently among the earliest if not the very oldest temples in India,\r\ndedicated to the new religion, which was then raising its head in\r\ndefiance to Buddhism.\r\n\r\nFrom their coins and inscriptions, we may feel certain that the Guptas\r\npossessed when in the plenitude of their power the whole of northern\r\nIndia with the province of Gujerat, but how far the boasts of Samudra\r\nGupta on the Allahabad pillar were justified is by no means clear. If\r\nthat inscription is to be believed, the whole of the southern country as\r\nfar as Ceylon, together with Assam and Nepal, were subject to their\r\nsway. However brilliant it may have been, their power was of short\r\nduration. Gujerat and all the western provinces were wrested from them\r\nby the Ballabhis, about the year 465, and a new kingdom then founded by\r\na dynasty bearing that name, which lasted till the great catastrophe,\r\nwhich about two and a half centuries afterwards revolutionised India.\r\n\r\n\r\nUJJAIN DYNASTY.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was becoming evident in the time of the Guptas that a change\r\nwas creeping over the religious belief of India, it was not then that\r\nthe blow was struck which eventually proved fatal, but by a dynasty\r\nwhich succeeded them in Central India. Being Hindus, we know less that\r\nis authentic about their history than about the Buddhist dynasties, who\r\nlived to inscribe their names on rocks and in caves; but there seems\r\nvery little doubt that the great Vicramaditya reigned in Malwa from 495\r\nto 530, though the Hindus, in order to connect his name with an era they\r\nthought fit to establish 56 years B.C., have done all they can to\r\nmystify and obscure the chronology of the period. Notwithstanding this,\r\nit seems perfectly clear that about this time there reigned in central\r\nIndia a king who, by his liberality and magnificence, acquired a renown\r\namong the Hindus, only second to that obtained by Solomon among the\r\nJews. By his patronage of literature and his encouragement of art, his\r\nfame spread over the length and breadth of the land, and to this day his\r\nname is quoted as the symbol of all that is great and magnificent in\r\nIndia. What is more to our present purpose, he was an undoubted patron\r\nof the Brahmanical religion, a worshipper of Siva and Vishnu, and no\r\ntradition associates his name directly or indirectly with anything\r\nconnected with Buddhism. Unfortunately we have no buildings which can be\r\nattributed to him, and no inscriptions. But the main fact of a\r\nBrahmanical king reigning and acquiring such influence in Central India\r\nat that time is only too significant of the declining position of the\r\nBuddhist religion at that period.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Siladitya, seems to have returned to the old faith, and\r\nduring his long reign of sixty years to have adhered to the Buddhist\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the next century, after a short period of anarchy,\r\nwe find a second Siladitya seated on the throne of Canouge as lord\r\nparamount in India, and, during a prosperous reign of thirty-eight to\r\nforty years, exercising supreme sway in that country. It was during his\r\nreign that the Chinese pilgrim, Hiouen Thsang visited India, and gave a\r\nmuch more full and graphic account of what he saw than his predecessor\r\nFa Hian. Nothing can be more characteristic of the state of religious\r\nfeeling, and the spirit of toleration then prevailing, than the fête\r\ngiven by this king at Allahabad in the year 643, at which the kings of\r\nBallabhi and Kamarupa (Assam) were present. The king being himself a\r\nBuddhist, the first days were devoted to the distribution, among the\r\nfollowers of that religion, of the treasures accumulated during the\r\nprevious five years, but then came the turn of the Brahmans, who were\r\ntreated with equal honour and liberality; then followed the fête of the\r\nother sects, among whom the Jains appear conspicuous. All were feasted\r\nand fêted, and sent away laden with gifts and mementos of the\r\nmagnificence and liberality of the great king.\r\n\r\nPleasant as this picture is to look upon, it is evident that such a\r\nstate of affairs could hardly be stable, and it was in vain to expect\r\nthat peace could long be maintained between a rising and ambitious sect,\r\nand one which was fast sinking into decay; apparently beneath the load\r\nof an overgrown priesthood. Accordingly we find that ten years after the\r\ndeath of Siladitya troubles supervened as prophesied,[21] and the\r\ncurtain soon descends on the great drama of the history of northern\r\nIndia, not to be raised again for nearly three centuries. It is true, we\r\ncan still follow the history of the Ballabhis for some little time\r\nlonger, and it would be satisfactory if we could fix the date of their\r\ndestruction with precision, as it was the event which in the Hindu mind\r\nis considered the closing act of the drama. If it was destroyed by a\r\nforeign enemy, it must have been by the Moslem, either before or during\r\nthe time Mohammed Kasim, A.H. 712, 713. It was a flourishing city in\r\n640, when visited by Hiouen Thsang, and from that time, till the death\r\nof Kasim, the Moslems were in such power on the Indus, and their\r\nhistorians tell us the events of these years in such detail, that no\r\nother foreigner could have crossed the river during that period. If it\r\nperished by some internal revolution of convulsion, which is more\r\nprobable, it only shared the fate that overtook all northern India about\r\nthis period. Strange to say, even the Moslems, then in the plenitude of\r\ntheir power during the Khalifat of Bagdad, retired from their Indian\r\nconquests, as if the seething cauldron were too hot for even them to\r\nexist within its limits.\r\n\r\nThe more southern dynasty of the Chalukyas of Kalyan seem to have\r\nretained their power down to about 750, and may, up to that time, have\r\nexercised a partial sway to the north of the Nerbudda, but after that we\r\nlose all sight of them; while, as a closing act in the great drama, the\r\nRaja Tarangini represents the King of Kashmir--Lalitaditya--as\r\nconquering India from north to south, and subjecting all the five\r\nkingdoms, into which it was nominally divided, to his imperious sway.\r\n\r\nWe need not stop now to inquire whether this was exactly what happened\r\nor not. It is sufficient for present purposes to know that about the\r\nmiddle of the 8th century a dark cloud settled over the north of India,\r\nand that during the next two centuries she was torn to pieces by\r\ninternal troubles, which have left nothing but negative evidence of\r\ntheir existence. During that period no event took place of which we have\r\nany record; no dynasty rose to sufficient distinction to be quoted even\r\nin the lists of the bard; no illustrious name appears whose acts have\r\nbeen recorded; no buildings were erected of which we have a trace;[22]\r\nand but few inscriptions engraved. Dark night seems to have settled\r\nover the land, and whether we shall ever be able to penetrate into its\r\nmysteries seems more than doubtful.\r\n\r\nWhen light again appears in the middle of the 10th century the scene is\r\nwonderfully changed. Buddhism had practically disappeared in the north\r\nand west at least, though it still lingered on in Bengal, and Jainism\r\nhad supplanted it in most places; but the mass of the people had become\r\nfollowers of Vishnu or Siva. New dynasties had arisen which, though they\r\ntry to trace their lineage back to the troublous times when Ballabhi\r\nfell, were new to Indian history. Old India had passed away, and the\r\nhistory of modern India was about to open. The old dynasties had become\r\nextinct, and the Rajput races were gaily stepping forward to assume\r\ntheir places--too soon, alas! to be engaged in a life or death struggle\r\nwith the most implacable foe to their race and religion that India has\r\never known. It was a cruel Nemesis that their victories over the\r\nBuddhists should soon have been followed by the fatal siege at Somnath\r\nin 1024, and the fight on the banks of the Ghaghar in 1193, which\r\npractically laid India at the feet of the Moslem invader, and changed\r\nthe whole course of her subsequent career. But, as hinted above, with\r\nthe appearance of the Moslem on the scene, our chronological\r\ndifficulties cease, and the subject need not therefore be further\r\npursued in this introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATIONS.\r\n\r\nFrom the above brief sketch of ancient Indian history it may be gathered\r\nthat it is doubtful whether we shall ever be able to clothe with solid\r\nflesh the skeleton of history which is all we possess anterior to the\r\nadvent of Buddha. It is also possible that pious frauds may have so\r\nconfused the sequence of events between his death and the rise of the\r\nMauryas, that there will be great difficulty in restoring that period to\r\nanything like completeness. But for the thousand years that elapsed\r\nbetween “the revenge of Chanakya” and the fall of Ballabhi the materials\r\nare ample, and when sufficient industry is applied to their elucidation\r\nthere is little doubt that the whole may be made clear and intelligible.\r\nIt does not fall within the scope of this work to attempt such a task;\r\nbut it is necessary to endeavour to make its outlines clear, as, without\r\nthis being done, what follows will be utterly unintelligible; while, at\r\nthe same time, one of the principal objects of this work is to point out\r\nhow the architecture, which is one important branch of the evidence, may\r\nbe brought to bear on the subject.\r\n\r\nNo direct evidence, however, derived only from events that occurred in\r\nIndia itself, would suffice to make the phenomena of her history clear,\r\nwithout taking into account the successive migrations of tribes and\r\npeoples who, in all ages, so far as we know, poured across the Indus\r\nfrom the westward to occupy her fertile plains.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the great master fact that explains almost all we\r\nknow of the ancient history of India is our knowledge that two or three\r\nthousand years before the birth of Christ a Sanscrit-speaking nation\r\nmigrated from the valleys of the Oxus and Jaxartes. They crossed the\r\nIndus in such numbers as to impress their civilisation and their\r\nlanguage on the whole of the north of India, and this to such an extent\r\nas practically to obliterate, as far as history is concerned, the\r\noriginal inhabitants of the valley of the Ganges, whoever they may have\r\nbeen. At the time when this migration took place the power and\r\ncivilisation of Central Asia were concentrated on the lower Euphrates,\r\nand the Babylonian empire never seems to have extended across the\r\nCarmanian desert to the eastward. The road, consequently, between\r\nBactria and India was open, and nations might pass and re-pass between\r\nthe two countries without fear of interruption from any other people.\r\n\r\nIf any of the ancient dynasties of Babylonia extended their power\r\ntowards the East, it was along the coast of Gedrosia, and not in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction. It is, indeed, by no means improbable, as\r\nhinted above, that the origin of the Dravidians may be found among the\r\nAccadian or in some of the Turanian peoples who occupied southern\r\nBabylonia in ancient times, and who may, either by sea or land, have\r\npassed to the western shores of India. Till, however, further\r\ninformation is available, this is mere speculation, though probably in\r\nthe direction in which truth may hereafter be found.\r\n\r\nWhen the seat of power was moved northward to Nineveh, the Assyrians\r\nseem to have occupied the country eastward of the Caspian in sufficient\r\nforce to prevent any further migration. At least, after that time--say\r\nB.C. 1000--we have no further trace of any Aryan tribe crossing the\r\nIndus going eastward, and it seems mainly to have been a consequence of\r\nthis cutting off of the supply of fresh blood that the purity of their\r\nrace in India was so far weakened as to admit of the Buddhist reform\r\ntaking root, and being adopted to the extent it afterwards attained.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the Achemænian sway, the Persians certainly\r\noccupied the countries about the Oxus in sufficient strength to prevent\r\nany movement of the peoples. So essentially indeed had Bactria and\r\nSogdiana become parts of the Persian empire, that Alexander was obliged\r\nto turn aside from his direct route to conquer them, as well as the rest\r\nof the kingdom of Darius, before advancing on India.\r\n\r\nWhether it were founded for that purpose or not, the little Greek\r\nkingdom of Bactria was sufficiently powerful, while it lasted, to keep\r\nthe barbarians in check; but when about the year 127-126 B.C., the\r\nYuechi and other cognate tribes invaded Sogdiana, and finally about 120\r\nB.C. conquered the whole of Bactria,[23] they opened a new chapter in\r\nthe history of India, the effects of which are felt to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet quite clear how soon after the destruction of the Bactrian\r\nkingdom these Turanian tribes conquered Cabul, and occupied the country\r\nbetween that city and the Indus. Certain it is, however, that they were\r\nfirmly seated on the banks of that river before the Christian Era, and\r\nunder the great king Kanishka had become an Indian power of very\r\nconsiderable importance. The date of this king is, unfortunately, one of\r\nthose small puzzles that still remain to be solved. Generally, it is\r\nsupposed he reigned till about twenty to forty years after Christ.[24]\r\nEvidence, however, has lately been brought to light, which seems to\r\nprove that he was the founder of the Saka era, A.D. 79, and that his\r\nreign must be placed in the last quarter of the first century of our\r\nera, instead of in the earlier half.[25]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it seems quite certain that the power of these\r\nTuruska kings spread over the whole Punjab, and extended as far at least\r\nas Muttra on the Jumna, in the first century of the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nAt the same time another horde, known to us only from the coins and\r\ninscriptions in which they call themselves Sahs or Sah kings, crossed\r\nthe Indus lower down, and occupied the whole of the province of Gujerat.\r\nIt is not quite clear whether the first of them, Nahapana, was only the\r\nViceroy of one of these northern kings--probably of Kanishka\r\nhimself--though he and his successors afterwards became independent, and\r\nfounded a kingdom of their own. They seem to date their coins and\r\ninscriptions from the Saka era, A.D. 79, and the series extends from\r\nthat date to A.D. 349, or at latest to 371.[26] It thus happens that\r\nthough Gautamiputra, the Andra king (312-333), boasts of having humbled\r\nthem,[27] they were only in fact finally disposed of by the rise of the\r\nGuptas.\r\n\r\nNo other foreign race, so far as we know, seems to have crossed the\r\nLower Indus into India. But the whole external history of northern\r\nIndia, from the time of Kanishka to that of Ahmed Shah Durani (1761) is\r\na narrative of a continuous succession of tribes of Scythian origin,\r\npouring across the Upper Indus into India, each more Turanian than the\r\none that preceded it, till the whole culminated in the Mogul conquest of\r\nIndia, in the 15th century, by a people as distinct in blood from the\r\nAryans as any that exist.\r\n\r\nOf the older races, it seems probable that the Yavanas must be\r\ndistinguished from the Turanians. It will hardly now be contended that\r\nthey were pure Greeks, though their name may be merely a\r\nmispronunciation of Ionian. The term seems to have been applied by\r\nIndian authors to any foreign race coming from the westward who did not\r\nbelong to one of the acknowledged kingdoms known to them. As such it\r\nwould apply to any western adventurers, who during the existence of the\r\nBactrian kingdom sought to establish settlements in any part of India,\r\nand would also apply to the expatriated Bactrians themselves when driven\r\nfrom their homes by the Yuechi, 120 or 130 years B.C. It is only in this\r\nsense that we can explain their presence in Orissa before and about the\r\nChristian Era, but in the west the term may have been more loosely\r\napplied. The Cambojas seem to have been a people inhabiting the country\r\nbetween Candahar and Cabul, who, when the tide was setting eastward,\r\njoined the crowd, and sought settlements in the more fertile countries\r\nwithin the Indus.\r\n\r\nThe Sakas were well known to classical authors as the Sacæ, or\r\nScythians. They pressed on with the rest, and became apparently most\r\nformidable during the first four centuries of the Christian Era. It was\r\napparently their defeat by the great Vicramaditya in the battle at\r\nKorûr, on the banks of the Indus, A.D. 524 or 544, that raised the\r\npopularity of that monarch to its highest pitch, and induced the Hindus\r\nat a subsequent age to institute the era known by his name 600 years\r\nbefore his time, and another called by his other name, Sri Harsha, 1000\r\nyears before the date of the battle of Korûr.[28]\r\n\r\nAnother important horde were the Ephthalites, or White Huns, who came\r\ninto India apparently in the 4th century, and one of whose kings, if we\r\nmay trust Cosmas Indicopleustes, was the head of a powerful state in\r\nnorthern India, about the year 535. They, too, seem to have been\r\nconquered about the same time by the Hindus, and, as both the Sakas and\r\nHunas were undoubtedly Buddhists, it may have been their destruction\r\nthat first weakened the cause of that religion, and which led to its\r\nultimate defeat a little more than a century afterwards.\r\n\r\nDuring the dark ages, 750 to 950, we do not know of any horde passing\r\nthe Indus. The Mahomedans were probably too strong on the frontier to\r\nadmit of its being done, and after that age they--and they\r\nonly--conducted the various invasions which completely changed the face\r\nand character of northern India. For seven centuries they were\r\ncontinued, with only occasional interruptions, and at last resulted in\r\nplacing the Mahomedan power supreme, practically, over the whole of\r\nIndia, but only to fall to pieces like a house of cards, before the\r\ntouch of Western civilisation. All this, however, is written, and\r\nwritten so distinctly, in so many books, that it need not be\r\nrecapitulated here.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\nIf the records of the ancient history of northern India are\r\nunsatisfactory and untrustworthy, those of the southern part of the\r\npeninsula are at least ten times more so. The Dravidians have no ancient\r\nliterature like that of the Vedas. They have no traditions which point\r\nto any seat of their race out of India, or of their having migrated from\r\nany country with whose inhabitants they can claim any kindred. So far as\r\nthey know, they are indigenous and aboriginal. The utmost extent to\r\nwhich even their traditions extend is to claim for their leading race of\r\nkings--the Pandyas--a descent from Arjuna, one of the heroes of the\r\n‘Mahabharata.’ He, it is said, when on his travels, married a princess\r\nof the land, and she gave birth to the eponymous hero of their race, and\r\nhence their name. It is true, indeed, that they produce long lists of\r\nkings, which they pretend stretch back till the times of the Pandus.\r\nThese were examined by the late Professor Wilson in 1836, and he\r\nconjectured that they might extend back to the 5th or 6th century before\r\nour era.[29] But all that has since come to light has tended to show\r\nthat even this may be an over-estimate of their antiquity. If, however,\r\nas Dr. Kern believes, the Choda, Pada, and Keralaputra of the second\r\nedict of Asoka do really represent the Cholas, Pandyas, Cheras, of\r\nmodern times, this triarchy existed in the third century B.C.; but there\r\nare difficulties in the way of this identification which have not yet\r\nbeen removed. In fact, all we really do know is that, in classical\r\ntimes, there was a Regio Pandionis in the country afterwards known as\r\nthe Pandyan kingdom of Madura, and it has been conjectured that the king\r\nwho sent an embassy to Augustus in 27 B.C.[30] was not a Porus, which\r\nwould indicate a northern race, but this very king of the south. Be\r\nthis, however, as it may, we do know, by the frequent mention of this\r\ncountry by classical authors, that it was at least sufficiently\r\ncivilised in the early centuries of our era to carry on a considerable\r\namount of commerce with the western nations, and there is consequently\r\nno improbability that at least one powerful dynasty may then have been\r\nestablished in the south. If so, that dynasty was certainly the Pandyan.\r\nThe Chola and the Chera became important states only at a much later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to their literature we find nothing to encourage any hope\r\nthat we may penetrate further back into their history than we have\r\nhitherto been able to do. Dr. Caldwell, the best and latest authority on\r\nthe subject, ascribes the oldest work in the Tamil, or any southern\r\nlanguage, to the 8th or 9th century of our era,[31] and that even then\r\ncan hardly be called native, as it undoubtedly belongs to the Jains, who\r\nare as certainly a northern sect. According to the same authority, it\r\nwas superseded by a Vaishnava literature about the 12th or 13th century,\r\nand that again made way for one of Saiva tendency about the latter date.\r\nThere is no trace of any Buddhist literature in the south, and nothing,\r\nconsequently, that would enable us to connect the history of the south\r\nwith the tolerably well-ascertained chronology of Ceylon or Northern\r\nIndia, nor am I aware of the existence of any ancient Buddhist monuments\r\nin the south which would help us in this difficulty.[32]\r\n\r\nNot having passed through Bactria, or having lived in contact with any\r\npeople making or using coins, the Dravidians have none of their own, and\r\nconsequently that source of information is not available. Whatever\r\nhoards of ancient coins have been found in the Madras Presidency have\r\nbeen of purely Roman origin, brought there for the purpose of trade, and\r\nburied to protect them from spoliation.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions, which are literally innumerable all over the\r\nPresidency, are the one source from which we can hope that new light may\r\nbe thrown on the history of the country, but none of those hitherto\r\nbrought to light go further back than the 5th or 6th century, and it is\r\nnot clear that earlier ones may be found.[33] It is, at all events, the\r\nmost hopeful field that lies open to future explorers in these dark\r\ndomains. There is nothing, however, that would lead us to expect to find\r\nany Tamil or native inscription in the country extending so far back as\r\nthe age of Constantine. Those on the raths at Mahavellipore, or the\r\ncaves at Badami, which may be as old as the age of Justinian, are in\r\nSanscrit, and consequently look more like an evidence of the northern\r\nraces pushing southward than of the southern races extending themselves\r\nnorthward, or being sufficiently advanced in civilisation to erect for\r\nthemselves the monuments on which these inscriptions are found.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the architecture of the south we arrive at precisely the\r\nsame conclusions as to the antiquity of Dravidian civilisation that Dr.\r\nCaldwell arrived at from a study of their literature. The only important\r\nBuddhist monument yet discovered in the Presidency is that at Amravati,\r\non the Kistnah,[34] but that is avowedly a foreign intrusion. It was a\r\ncolony or settlement formed by the northern Buddhists at or near their\r\nport of departure for Java and their eastern settlements. The rock-cut\r\ntemples at Mahavellipore and Badami seem to be the works of northern\r\nHindus advancing southward in the 5th or 6th century, and engraving the\r\nevidence of their religion on the imperishable rock. So far as is yet\r\nknown, no indigenous native temple has been brought to light, built by\r\nany native king, or with inscriptions in any southern tongue, whose date\r\ncan be carried further back than the 8th century. From that time forward\r\ntheir building activity was enormous. The style culminated in the 16th\r\nand 17th centuries, to perish in the 18th, under the influence of a\r\nforeign and unsympathetic invader. It is, however, by no means\r\nimpossible that future investigation may enable us to fill up a portion\r\nat least of the gap that exists between the 5th and the 8th century.\r\nThere may be buildings yet undescribed which are older than any we now\r\nknow. But if they do carry us back to the 5th century, which is more\r\nthan can reasonably be expected, they are still seven or eight centuries\r\nbehind what we know for certainty to have existed in the north. There we\r\nhave buildings and caves certainly, extending back to B.C. 250, and it\r\nseems by no means impossible that with sculptures, coins, and\r\ninscriptions, and written documents, we may some day be able to bridge\r\nover the gulf that exists between the death of Buddha and the accession\r\nof the Mauryas. In other words, the materials for history in the North\r\nof India carry us back with the same relative degree of certainty for\r\nmore than a thousand years beyond what those found in the south enable\r\nus to trace of her history or her arts.\r\n\r\nWhen the history of the south does acquire something like consistency it\r\ntakes the form of a triarchy of small states. The eldest and most\r\nimportant, that of Mádura--so called after Muttra on the Jumna--was also\r\nthe most civilised, and continued longest as a united and independent\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Chola rose into power on the banks of the Cauvery, and to the\r\nnorthward of it, about the year 1000, though no doubt they existed as a\r\nsmall state about Conjeveram for some centuries before that time. The\r\nthird, the Chera, were located in the southern Mysore country, and\r\nprobably extending to the coast as early as the 4th or 5th century, and\r\ngradually worked their way northward, and became so powerful that there\r\nis reason for believing that during the dark ages of the north (750 to\r\n950) their power extended to the Nerbudda, and it may be to them that we\r\nowe the Kylas and other excavations at Ellora, erected in the southern\r\nstyle about that time. They were, however, superseded, first by the\r\nCholas, about A.D. 1000, and finally eclipsed by the Hoisala Bellalas, a\r\ncentury or so afterwards. These last became the paramount power in the\r\nsouth, till their capital--Hullabîd--was taken, and their dynasty\r\ndestroyed by the Mahomedan, in the year 1310.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of the Mahomedans on the scene the difficulties of\r\nIndian chronology disappear in the south, as well as in the north. From\r\nthat time forward the history of India is found in such works as those\r\nwritten by Ferishta or Abul Fazl, and has been abstracted and condensed\r\nin numerous works in almost every European language. There are still, it\r\nmust be confessed, slight discrepancies and difficulties about the\r\nsequence of some events in the history of the native principalities.\r\nThese, however, are not of such importance as at all to affect, much\r\nless to invalidate, any reasoning that may be put forward regarding the\r\nhistory or affinities of any buildings, and this is the class of\r\nevidence which principally concerns what is written in the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCULPTURES.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the subject treated of in the following pages quite\r\ncomplete, it ought, no doubt, to be preceded by an introduction\r\ndescribing first the sculpture and then the mythology of the Hindus in\r\nso far as they are at present known to us. There are in fact few works\r\nconnected with this subject more wanted at the present day than a good\r\ntreatise on these subjects. When Major Moor published the ‘Hindu\r\nPantheon’ in 1810, the subject was comparatively new, and the materials\r\ndid not exist in this country for a full and satisfactory illustration\r\nof it in all its branches. When, in 1832, Coleman published his\r\n‘Mythology of the Hindus,’ he was enabled from the more recent\r\nresearches of Colebroke and Wilson, to improve the text considerably,\r\nbut his illustrations are very inferior to those of his predecessor.\r\nMoor chose his from such bronzes or marbles as existed in our museums.\r\nColeman’s were generally taken from modern drawings, or the tawdry\r\nplaster images made for the Durga puja of Bengali Babus. By the aid of\r\nphotography any one now attempting the task would be able to select\r\nperfectly authentic examples from Hindu temples of the best age. If this\r\nwere done judiciously, and the examples carefully engraved, it would not\r\nonly afford a more satisfactory illustration of the mythology of the\r\nHindus than has yet been given to the public, but it might also be made\r\na history of the art of sculpture in India, in all the ages in which it\r\nis known to us. It is doubtful, however, whether such a work could be\r\nsuccessfully carried through in this country at the present day. The\r\nphotographs that exist of the various deities have generally been taken\r\nrepresenting them only as they appear as ornaments of the temples,\r\nwithout special reference to their mythological character. They are\r\nsufficient to show what the sculptor intended, but not so detailed as to\r\nallow all their emblems or characteristics being distinctly perceived.\r\nTo be satisfactory as illustrations of the mythology, it is\r\nindispensable that these points should all be made clear. At the same\r\ntime it is to be feared that there is hardly any one in this country so\r\nfamiliar with all the details of emblems and symbols as to be able to\r\ngive the exact meaning of all that is represented. It would require the\r\nassistance of some Pandit brought up in the faith, and who is familiar\r\nwith the significance of all the emblems, to convey to others the true\r\nmeaning of these innumerable carvings. In India it could easily be\r\naccomplished, and it is consequently hoped it may before long be\r\nattempted there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom its very nature, it is evident that sculpture can hardly ever be so\r\nimportant as architecture as an illustration of the progress of the\r\narts, or the affinities of nations. Tied down to the reproduction of the\r\nimmutable human figure, sculpture hardly admits of the same variety, or\r\nthe same development, as such an art as architecture, whose business it\r\nis to administer to all the varied wants of mankind and to express the\r\nmultifarious aspirations of the human mind. Yet sculpture has a history,\r\nand one that can at times convey its meaning with considerable\r\ndistinctness. No one, for instance, can take up such a book as that of\r\nCicognara,[35] and follow the gradual development of the art as he\r\ndescribes it, from the first rude carvings of the Byzantine school, till\r\nit returned in the present day to the mechanical perfection of the old\r\nGreek art, though without its ennobling spirit, and not feel that he\r\nhas before him a fairly distinct illustration of the progress of the\r\nhuman mind during that period. Sculpture in India may fairly claim to\r\nrank, in power of expression, with mediæval sculpture in Europe, and to\r\ntell its tale of rise and decay with equal distinctness; but it is also\r\ninteresting as having that curious Indian peculiarity of being written\r\nin decay. The story that Cicognara tells is one of steady forward\r\nprogress towards higher aims and better execution. The Indian story is\r\nthat of backward decline, from the sculptures of the Bharhut and\r\nAmravati topes, to the illustrations of Coleman’s ‘Hindu Mythology.’\r\n\r\nWhen Hindu sculpture first dawns upon us in the rails at Buddh Gaya, and\r\nBharhut, B.C. 200 to 250, it is thoroughly original, absolutely without\r\na trace of foreign influence, but quite capable of expressing its ideas,\r\nand of telling its story with a distinctness that never was surpassed,\r\nat least in India. Some animals, such as elephants, deer, and monkeys,\r\nare better represented there than in any sculptures known in any part of\r\nthe world; so, too, are some trees, and the architectural details are\r\ncut with an elegance and precision which are very admirable. The human\r\nfigures, too, though very different from our standard of beauty and\r\ngrace, are truthful to nature, and, where grouped together, combine to\r\nexpress the action intended with singular felicity. For an honest\r\npurpose-like pre-Raphaelite kind of art, there is probably nothing much\r\nbetter to be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe art certainly had declined when the gateways at Sanchi were executed\r\nin the first century of the Christian Era. They may then have gained a\r\nlittle in breadth of treatment, but it had certainly lost much in\r\ndelicacy and precision. Its downward progress was then, however,\r\narrested, apparently by the rise in the extreme north-west of India of a\r\nschool of sculpture strongly impregnated with the traditions of\r\nclassical art. It is not yet clear whether this arose from a school of\r\nart implanted in that land by the Bactrian Greeks, or whether it was\r\nmaintained by direct intercourse with Rome and Byzantium during the\r\nearly centuries of the Christian Era. Probably both causes acted\r\nsimultaneously, and one day we may be able to discriminate what is due\r\nto each. For the present it is sufficient to know that a quasi-classical\r\nschool of sculpture did exist in the Punjab, and to the west of the\r\nIndus during the first five centuries after Christ, and it can hardly\r\nhave flourished there so long, without its presence being felt in India.\r\n\r\nIts effects were certainly apparent at Amravati in the 4th and 5th\r\ncenturies, where a school of sculpture was developed, partaking of the\r\ncharacteristics of both those of Central India and of the west. Though\r\nit may, in some respects, be inferior to either of the parent styles,\r\nthe degree of perfection reached by the art of sculpture at Amravati\r\nmay probably be considered as the culminating point attained by that art\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nWhen we meet it again in the early Hindu temples, and later Buddhist\r\ncaves, it has lost much of its higher æsthetic and phonetic qualities,\r\nand frequently resorts to such expedients as giving dignity to the\r\nprincipal personages by making them double the size of less important\r\ncharacters, and of distinguishing gods from men by giving them more\r\nheads and arms than mortal man can use or understand.\r\n\r\nAll this is developed, it must be confessed, with considerable vigour\r\nand richness of effect in the temples of Orissa and the Mysore, down to\r\nthe 13th or 14th century. After that, in the north it was checked by the\r\npresence of the Moslems; but, in the south, some of the most remarkable\r\ngroups and statues--and they are very remarkable--were executed after\r\nthis time, and continued to be executed, in considerable perfection down\r\nto the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see in the sequel, the art of architecture continues to be\r\npractised with considerable success in parts of India remote from\r\nEuropean influence; so much so, that it requires a practised eye to\r\ndiscriminate between what is new and what is old. But the moment any\r\nfigures are introduced, especially if in action, the illusion vanishes.\r\nNo mistake is then possible, for the veriest novice can see how\r\npainfully low the art of sculpture has fallen. Were it not for this,\r\nsome of the modern temples in Gujerat and Central India are worthy to\r\nrank with those of past centuries; but their paintings and their\r\nsculptured decorations excite only feelings of dismay, and lead one to\r\ndespair of true art being ever again revived in the East.\r\n\r\nTo those who are familiar with the principles on which these arts are\r\npractised, the cause of this difference is obvious enough. Architecture\r\nbeing a technic art, its forms may be handed down traditionally, and its\r\nprinciples practised almost mechanically. The higher phonetic arts,\r\nhowever, of sculpture and painting admit of no such mechanical\r\ntreatment. They require individual excellence, and a higher class of\r\nintellectual power of expression, to ensure their successful\r\ndevelopment. Architecture, may, consequently, linger on amidst much\r\npolitical decay; but, like literature, the phonetic arts can only be\r\nsuccessfully cultivated where a higher moral and intellectual standard\r\nprevails than, it is feared, is at present to be found in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYTHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nWhenever any one will seriously undertake to write the history of\r\nsculpture in India, he will find the materials abundant and the sequence\r\nby no means difficult to follow; but, with regard to mythology, the case\r\nis different. It cannot, however, be said that the materials are not\r\nabundant for this branch of the inquiry also; but they are of a much\r\nless tangible or satisfactory nature, and have become so entangled, that\r\nit is extremely difficult to obtain any clear ideas regarding them; and\r\nit is to be feared they must remain so, until those who investigate the\r\nsubject will condescend to study the architecture and the sculpture of\r\nthe country as well as its books. The latter contain a good deal, but\r\nthey do not contain all the information available on the subject, and\r\nthey require to be steadied and confirmed by what is built or carved,\r\nwhich alone can give precision and substance to what is written.\r\n\r\nMuch of the confusion of ideas that prevails on this subject no doubt\r\narises from the exaggerated importance it has of late years been the\r\nfashion to ascribe to the Vedas, as explaining everything connected with\r\nthe mythology of the Hindus. It would, indeed, be impossible to\r\nover-estimate the value of these writings from a philological or\r\nethnological point of view. Their discovery and elaboration have\r\nrevolutionised our ideas as to the migrations of races in the remote\r\nages of antiquity, and establish the affiliation of the Aryan races on a\r\nbasis that seems absolutely unassailable; but it cannot be too strongly\r\ninsisted upon that the Aryans are a race of strangers in India, distinct\r\nfrom the Indian people themselves. They may, as hinted above, have come\r\ninto India some three thousand years before Christ, and may have\r\nretained their purity of blood and faith for two thousand years; but\r\nwith the beginning of the political Kali Yug--or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, at the time of the events detailed in the ‘Mahabharata,’ say\r\n1200 years B.C.--they had lost much of both; while every successive wave\r\nof immigration that has crossed the Indus during the last three thousand\r\nyears has impaired the purity of their race. From this cause, and from\r\ntheir admixture with the aborigines, it may probably be with confidence\r\nasserted that there is not now five per cent.--perhaps not one--of pure\r\nAryan blood in the present population of India, nor, consequently, does\r\nthe religion of the Vedas constitute one-twentieth part of the present\r\nreligion of the people.\r\n\r\nThough this may be absolutely so, it must not be overlooked that there\r\nare few things more remarkable, as bearing on this subject, than the\r\nextraordinary intellectual superiority of the Aryans over the Dasyus, or\r\nwhatever we may call the people they found in India when they entered\r\nit. This superiority was sufficient to enable them to subdue the\r\ncountry, though they were probably infinitely inferior in numbers to the\r\nconquered people, and to retain them in subjection through long ages of\r\ntime. Even now, when their purity of blood has become so diluted that\r\nthey are almost lost among the people, their intellect, as embalmed in\r\ntheir writings, has left its impress on every corner of the land, and is\r\nstill appealed to as a revelation of the will of God to man.\r\n\r\nWith the Vedas, however, we have very little to do in the present work.\r\nThe worship they foreshadow is of a class too purely intellectual to\r\nrequire the assistance of the stonemason and the carver to give it\r\nexpression. The worship of the Aryans was addressed to the sun and moon.\r\nThe firmament and all its hosts; the rain-bearing cloud; the\r\nsun-ushering dawn; all that was beautiful in the heavens above or\r\nbeneficent on earth, was sung by them in hymns of elevated praise, and\r\naddressed in terms of awe or endearment as fear or hope prevailed in the\r\nbosom of the worshipper.[36] Had this gone on for some time longer than\r\nit did, the objects worshipped by the Aryans in India might have become\r\ngods, like those of Greece and Rome, endowed with all the feelings and\r\nall the failings of humanity. In India it was otherwise; the deities\r\nwere dethroned, but never were degraded. There is no trace in Vedic\r\ntimes, so far as at present known, of Indra or Varuna, of Agni or Ushas,\r\nbeing represented in wood or stone, or of their requiring houses or\r\ntemples to shelter them. It is true indeed that the terms of endearment\r\nin which they are addressed are frequently such as mortals use in\r\nspeaking of each other; but how otherwise can man express his feeling of\r\nlove or fear, or address his supplication to the being whose assistance\r\nhe implores?\r\n\r\nThe great beauty of the Veda is, that it stops short before the powers\r\nof nature are dwarfed into human forms, and when every man stood\r\nindependently by himself and sought through the intervention of all that\r\nwas great or glorious on the earth, or in the skies, to approach the\r\ngreat spirit that is beyond and above all created things.\r\n\r\nHad the Aryans ever been a numerical majority in India, and consequently\r\nable to preserve their blood and caste in tolerable purity, the religion\r\nof India never could have sunk so low as it did, though it might have\r\nfallen below the standard of the Veda. What really destroyed it was,\r\nthat each succeeding immigration of less pure Aryan or Turanian races\r\nrendered their numerical majority relatively less and less, while their\r\ninevitable influence so educated the subject races as to render their\r\nmoral majority even less important. These processes went on steadily and\r\nuninterruptedly till, in the time of Buddha, the native religions rose\r\nfairly to an equality with that of the Aryans, and afterwards for a\r\nwhile eclipsed it. The Vedas were only ultimately saved from absolute\r\nannihilation in India, by being embedded in the Vaishnava and Saiva\r\nsuperstitions, where their inanimate forms may still be recognised, but\r\npainfully degraded from their primitive elevation.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from the Vedas, and try to investigate the origin of those\r\nreligions that first opposed and finally absorbed the Vedas in their\r\nabominations, we find our means of information painfully scanty and\r\nunsatisfactory. As will appear in the sequel, all that was written in\r\nIndia that is worth reading was written by the Aryans; all that was\r\nbuilt was built by the Turanians, who wrote practically nothing. But the\r\nknown buildings extend back only to the 3rd century B.C., while the\r\nbooks are ten centuries earlier, or possibly even more than that, while,\r\nas might be expected, it is only accidentally and in the most\r\ncontemptuous terms that the proud Aryans even allude to the abject\r\nDasyus or their religion. What, therefore, we practically know of them\r\nis little more than inferences drawn from results, and from what we now\r\nsee passing in India.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the admitted imperfection of materials, it seems to be\r\nbecoming every day more and more evident, that we have in the north of\r\nIndia one great group of native or at least of Turanian religions, which\r\nwe know in their latest developments as the Buddhist, Jaina, and\r\nYaishnava religions. The first named we only know as it was taught by\r\nSakya Muni before his death in 543 B.C., but no one I presume supposes\r\nthat he was the first to invent that form of faith, or that it was not\r\nbased on some preceding forms. The Buddhists themselves, according to\r\nthe shortest calculation, admit of four preceding Buddhas--according to\r\nthe more usual accounts, of twenty-four. A place is assigned to each of\r\nthese, where he was born, and when he died, the father and mother’s name\r\nis recorded, and the name, too, of the Bodhi-tree under whose shade he\r\nattained Buddhahood. The dates assigned to each of these are childishly\r\nfabulous, but there seems no reason for doubting that they may have been\r\nreal personages, and their dates extend back to a very remote\r\nantiquity.[37]\r\n\r\nThe Jains, in like manner, claim the existence of twenty-four\r\nTirthankars, including Mahavira the last. Their places of birth and\r\ndeath are equally recorded, all are in northern India, and though little\r\nelse is known of them, they too may have existed. The series ends with\r\nMahavira, who was the contemporary--some say the preceptor--of Sakya\r\nMuni.\r\n\r\nThe Vaishnava series is shorter, consisting of only nine Avatars, but it\r\ntoo, closes at the same time, Buddha himself being the ninth and last.\r\nIts fifth Avatur takes us back to Rama, who, if our chronology is\r\ncorrect, may have lived B.C. 2000; the fourth,--Narasinha, or man\r\nlion--points to the time the Aryans entered India. The three first deal\r\nwith creation and events anterior to man’s appearance on earth. In this\r\nrespect the Vaishnava list differs from the other two. They only record\r\nthe existence of men who attained greatness by the practice of virtue,\r\nand immortality by teaching the ways of God to man. The Vaishnavas\r\nbrought God to earth, to mix and interfere in mundane affairs in a\r\nmanner that neither the Aryan nor the Buddhist ever dreamt of, and so\r\ndegraded the purer religion of India into the monstrous system of\r\nidolatry that now prevails in that country.\r\n\r\nNo attempt, so far as I know, has been made to explain the origin of the\r\nSaiva religion, or even to ascertain whether it was a purely local\r\nsuperstition, or whether it was imported from abroad. The earliest\r\nauthentic written allusion to it seems to be that of the Indian\r\nambassador to Bardasanes (A.D. 218, 222), who described a cave in the\r\nnorth of India which contained an image of a god, half-man,\r\nhalf-woman.[38] This is beyond doubt the Ardhanari form of Siva, so\r\nfamiliar afterwards at Elephanta and in every part of India. The\r\nearliest engraved representations of this god seem to be those on the\r\ncoins of Kadphises (B.C. 80 to 100[39]), where the figure with the\r\ntrident and the Bull certainly prefigure the principal personage in this\r\nreligion. Curiously enough, however, he or she is always accompanied by\r\nthe Buddhist trisul emblem, as if the king, or his subjects at least,\r\nsimultaneously professed both religions. Besides all this, it seems now\r\ntolerably well ascertained, that the practice of endowing gods with an\r\ninfinity of limbs took an earlier, certainly a greater development in\r\nThibet and the trans-Himalayan countries than in India, and that the\r\nwildest Tantric forms of Durga are more common and more developed in\r\nNepal and Thibet than they are even in India Proper. If this is so, it\r\nseems pretty clear, as the evidence now stands, that Saivism is a\r\nnorthern superstition introduced into India by the Yuechi or some of the\r\nnorthern hordes who migrated into India, either immediately before the\r\nChristian Era, or in the early centuries succeeding it.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem at first to have made much progress in the valley of\r\nthe Ganges, where the ground was preoccupied by the Vaishnava group, but\r\nto have been generally adopted in Rajputana, especially among the Jats,\r\nwho were almost certainly the descendants of the White Huns or\r\nEphthalites, and it seems also to have been early carried south by the\r\nBrahmans, when they undertook to instruct the Dravidians in the religion\r\nof the Puranas. That of the Vedas never seems to have been known in the\r\nsouth, and it was not till after the Vedas had been superseded by the\r\nnew system, that the Brahmanical religion was introduced among the\r\nsouthern people. It is also, it is to be feared, only too true that no\r\nattempt has yet been made to ascertain what the religion of the\r\nDravidians was before the northern Brahmans induced them to adopt either\r\nthe Jaina or the Vaishnava or Saiva forms of faith. It is possible that\r\namong the Pandu Kolis, and other forms of ‘Rude Stone Monuments’ that\r\nare found everywhere in the south, we may find the fossil remains of the\r\nold Dravidian faith before they adopted that of the Hindus. These\r\nmonuments, however, have not been examined with anything like the care\r\nrequisite for the solution of a problem like this, and till it is done\r\nwe must rest content with our ignorance.[40]\r\n\r\nIn the north we have been somewhat more fortunate, and enough is now\r\nknown to make it clear that, so soon as the inquirers can consent to put\r\naside personal jealousies, and apply themselves earnestly to the task,\r\nwe may know enough to make the general outline at least tolerably clear.\r\nWhen I first published my work on ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ seven\r\nyears ago, no one suspected, at least no one had hinted in type, that\r\nsuch a form of religion existed in Bengal. Since that time, however, so\r\nmuch has been written on the subject, and proof on proof has accumulated\r\nwith such rapidity, that few will now be bold enough to deny that Trees\r\nwere worshipped in India in the earliest times, and that a Naga people\r\ndid exist, especially in the north-west, who had a strange veneration\r\nfor snakes. It may be too bold a generalisation to assert, at present,\r\nthat no people became Buddhists who had not previously been serpent\r\nworshippers, but it certainly is nearer the truth than at first sight\r\nappears. It is, at all events, quite certain that underlying Buddhism we\r\neverywhere find evidence of a stratum of Tree and Serpent Worship.\r\nSometimes it may be repressed and obscured, but at others it crops up\r\nagain, and, to a certain extent, the worship of the Tree and the\r\nSerpent, at some times and in certain places, almost supersedes that of\r\nthe founder of the religion himself.\r\n\r\nThe five, or seven, or one thousand-headed Naga is everywhere present in\r\nthe temples of the Jains, and pervades the whole religion of the\r\nVaishnavas. In the great act of creation the Naga performs the principal\r\npart in the churning of the ocean, and in almost every representation of\r\nVishnu he appears either as supporting and watching over him, or as\r\nperforming some subsidiary part in the scene. It is, in fact, the Naga\r\nthat binds together and gives unity to this great group of religions,\r\nand it is the presence of the Tree and Serpent worship underlying\r\nBuddhism, Jainism, and Vishnuism that seems to prove almost\r\nincontestably that there existed a people in the north of India, whether\r\nwe call them Dasyus, Nishadhas, or by any other name, who were Tree and\r\nSerpent worshippers, before they adopted any of the Hindu forms of\r\nfaith. Nothing can be more antagonistic to the thoughts and feelings of\r\nany Aryan race than such forms of worship, and nothing more completely\r\nante-Vedic than its rites. It seems also to have no connection with\r\nSaivism.[41] Nor is there any trace of it found among the Dravidians.\r\nThere appears, in fact, no solution of the riddle possible, but to\r\nassume that it was an aboriginal superstition in the north of India, and\r\nit was the conversion of the people to whom it belonged that gave rise\r\nto that triarchy of religions that have succeeded each other in the\r\nnorth during the last two thousand years.\r\n\r\nThis solution of the difficulty has the further advantage that it steps\r\nin at once clearly to explain what philology is only dimly guessing at,\r\nthough its whole tendency now seems in the same direction. If this view\r\nof the mythology be correct, it seems certain that there existed in the\r\nnorth of India, before the arrival of the Aryans, a people whose\r\naffinities were all with the Thibetans, Burmese, Siamese, and other\r\ntrans-Himalayan populations, and who certainly were not Dravidians,\r\nthough they may have been intimately connected with one division at\r\nleast of the inhabitants of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBoth the pre-Aryan races of India belonged, of course, to the Turanian\r\ngroup; but my present impression is, as hinted above, that the\r\nDravidians belong to that branch of the great primordial family of\r\nmankind that was developed in Mesopotamia and the countries to the\r\nwestward of the Caspian. The Dasyus, on the contrary, have all their\r\naffinities with those to the eastward of that sea, and the two might\r\nconsequently be called the Western and the Eastern, or the Scythian and\r\nMongolian Turanians. Such a distinction would certainly represent our\r\npresent knowledge of the subject better than considering the whole as\r\none family, which is too often the case at the present day.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are speculations which hardly admit of proof in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge, and would consequently be quite out of\r\nplace here, were it not that some such theory seems indispensable to\r\nexplain the phenomena of the architectural history of India. That of the\r\nnorth is so essentially different from that of the south that they\r\ncannot possibly belong to the same people. Neither of them certainly are\r\nAryan; and unless we admit that the two divisions of the country were\r\noccupied by people essentially different in blood, though still\r\nbelonging to the building races of mankind, we cannot possibly\r\nunderstand how they always practised, and to the present employ, styles\r\nso essentially different. Until these various ethnographical and\r\nmythological problems are understood and appreciated, the styles of\r\narchitecture in India seem a chaos without purpose or meaning. Once,\r\nhowever, they are grasped and applied, their history assumes a dignity\r\nand importance far greater than is due to any merely æsthetic merits\r\nthey may possess. Even that, however, is in many respects remarkable,\r\nand, when combined with the scientific value of the styles, seem to\r\nrender them as worthy of study as those of any other people with whose\r\narts we are acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS.\r\n\r\nIt would add very much to the clearness of what follows if it were\r\npossible to compile any statistical tables which would represent with\r\nanything like precision the mode in which the people of India are\r\ndistributed, either as regards their religious beliefs or their\r\nethnographical relations. The late census of 1871-72 has afforded a mass\r\nof new material for this purpose, but the information is distributed\r\nthrough five folio volumes, in such a manner as to make it extremely\r\ndifficult to abstract what is wanted so as to render it intelligible to\r\nthe general reader. Even, however, if this were done, the result would\r\nhardly, for several reasons, be satisfactory. In the first place, the\r\ncensus is a first attempt, and the difficulty of collecting and\r\narranging such a mass of new materials was a task of the extremest\r\ndifficulty. The fault of any shortcomings, however, lay more with the\r\nenumerated than with the enumerators. Few natives know anything of\r\nethnography, or can give a distinct answer with regard to their race or\r\ndescent; and even with regard to religion their notions are equally\r\nhazy. Take for instance the table, page 93 of the Bombay Report. The\r\ncompilers there divide the Hindus of that Presidency into three\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\n 3,465,349 Saivas.\r\n 1,419,233 Vaishnavas.\r\n 8,029,989 Mixed.\r\n----------\r\n12,914,571\r\n\r\nThe mixed class they proceed to define as “all who simply worship some\r\ngod or goddess, without knowing anything of theology”--a description\r\nthat probably applies with equal truth to two-thirds of the Hindu\r\npopulation of the other presidencies. The upper and educated classes do\r\nknow now what sect they belong to, and the sects are so distinctly\r\nmarked as to admit of no doubt; but even that was not so clear in former\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe great defect, however, of the census is, that it does not include\r\nthe population of the Native States, estimated at 46,245,000, or\r\none-fifth of the whole population of India; and, though it may be fair\r\nto assume that the proportions of races and their beliefs are the same\r\nas those of the adjacent states under British rule, this is only an\r\nassumption, and as such must vitiate any attempt at precision in\r\nstatements regarding the whole of India.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these difficulties or defects, it may be useful to state\r\nhere that the population of the whole of India--exclusive, of course, of\r\nBritish Burmah--was ascertained by the late census to amount to\r\n235,000,000 of souls. Of these, about 7-10ths--or, more nearly,\r\n15-20ths--or 175,000,000, belonged to the various branches of the Hindu\r\nreligion; more than 1-5th or 4-20ths or 50,000,000, professed the\r\nMahomedan faith; and the remaining 1-20th was made up principally of the\r\nuncivilised hill tribes, and various minor sects which cannot correctly\r\nbe classified with the followers of Siva and Vishnu. In this last group\r\nof 11,000,000 are the Jains and the Christians, who, though so\r\ninfluential from their wealth or intellect, form numerically but a very\r\nsmall fraction of the entire population.\r\n\r\nThe tables of the census, unfortunately, afford us very little\r\ninformation that is satisfactory with regard to the distribution of\r\nraces among the people. From the new edition of Caldwell’s ‘Dravidian\r\nGrammar,’ we learn that upwards of 45,000,000 are Dravidian or speak\r\nTamil, or languages allied to that dialect.[42] This may be somewhat of\r\nan over-estimate, but, taking it as it stands, it accounts for only\r\n1-5th of the population; and what are we to say regarding the other\r\n4-5ths, or 190,000,000 of souls? Four or five millions may be put on one\r\nside as Koles, Bhîls, Sontals, Nagas, &c.--hill tribes of various\r\nclasses, whose affinities are not yet by any means settled, but whose\r\nethnic relations are of very minor importance compared with those of the\r\n185,000,000 remaining.\r\n\r\nAs the census leaves us very much in the dark on this subject, supposing\r\nwe assume that one-half, or 90,000,000 more or less, of the inhabitants\r\nof northern India are the descendants of the original inhabitants of the\r\ncountry--Dasyus, Nishadhas, or whatever we may call them. Let us further\r\ndivide the remaining 90,000,000 into three parts, and assume that\r\none-third are lineal descendants of the Aryans who entered India before\r\nthe time of Buddha; one-third the descendants of Yavanas, Sakas, Hunas,\r\nand other Scythian tribes who crossed the Indus between the Christian\r\nEra and the time of the Mahomedan invasion; and that the remainder are\r\nthe Moslem races, or their descendants, who have entered India during\r\nthe last 800 years. Such a scheme may nearly represent the facts of the\r\ncase; but it seems almost certainly to exaggerate the importance of the\r\nforeign immigrant element. Taking, for instance, the last, about which\r\nwe know most, it seems hardly probable that since the time of Mahmood of\r\nGuzni any such number of tribes professing the Mahomedan religion could\r\nhave entered India so as to be able to procreate a population of\r\n30,000,000 of souls, even supposing they had brought their women with\r\nthem--which they certainly did not, except in the most exceptional\r\ncases. Two or three millions of warriors may have crossed the Indus in\r\nthat time and settled in India, and, marrying the females of the\r\ncountry, may have had a numerous progeny; but thirty millions is a vast\r\npopulation by direct descent, especially as we know how many of the\r\nMoslems of India were recruited from slaves purchased and brought up in\r\nthe faith of their masters. In Bengal especially, where they are most\r\nnumerous, they are Bengalis pure and simple, many, perhaps most, of whom\r\nhave adopted that faith quite recently from motives it is not difficult\r\nto understand or explain. Though there may consequently be 50,000,000 of\r\nMussulmans in India at the present day, we may feel quite certain that\r\nnot one-half of this number are immigrants or the descendants of\r\nemigrants who entered India during the last eight centuries.\r\n\r\nThe same is probably true of the Turanian races, who entered India in\r\nthe first ten centuries after our era. It is most improbable that they\r\nwere sufficiently numerous to be the progenitors of thirty millions of\r\npeople, and, if they were so, the mothers, in nine cases out of ten,\r\nwere most probably natives of India.\r\n\r\nOf the Aryans we know less; but, if so great a number as thirty millions\r\ncan trace anything like a direct descent from them at the present day,\r\nthe amount of pure Aryan blood in their veins must be infinitesimally\r\nsmall. But, though their blood may be diluted, the influence of their\r\nintellect remains so powerfully impressed on every institution of the\r\ncountry that, had they perished altogether, their previous presence is\r\nstill an element of the utmost importance in the ethnic relations of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnother census may enable us to speak with more precision with regard to\r\nthese various divisions of the mass of the people of Hindustan, but\r\nmeanwhile the element that seems to be most important, though the least\r\ninvestigated hitherto, is the extent of the aboriginal race. It has\r\nhitherto been so overlooked, that putting it at ninety millions may seem\r\nto many an exaggeration. Its intellectual inferiority has kept it in the\r\nbackground, but its presence everywhere seems to me the only means of\r\nexplaining most of the phenomena we meet continually, especially those\r\nconnected with the history of the architecture of the country. Except on\r\nsome such hypothesis as that just shadowed forth, I do not know how we\r\nare to account for the presence of certain local forms of buildings we\r\nfind in the north, or to explain the persistence with which they were\r\nadhered to.\r\n\r\nWhen from these purely ethnographic speculations we turn to ask how far\r\nreligion and race coincide, we are left with still less information of a\r\nreliable character. As a rule, the Dravidians are Saiva, and Saiva in\r\nthe exact proportion of the purity of their blood. In other words, in\r\nthe extreme south of India they are immensely in the majority. In\r\nTanjore, 7 to 1 of the followers of Vishnu; in Mádura, 5 to 1; in\r\nTrichinopoly, 4 to 1; and Salem, and generally in the south, 2 to 1;[43]\r\nbut as we proceed northward they become equal, and in some of the\r\nnorthern districts of the Madras Presidency the proportions are\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal, and wherever Buddhism once prevailed, the Vaishnava sects\r\nare, as might be expected, the most numerous. Indeed if it were not that\r\nso much of the present Hindu religion is an importation into the south,\r\nand was taught to the Dravidians by Brahmans from the north, it would be\r\ndifficult to understand how the Vaishnava religion ever took root there,\r\nwhere Buddhism itself only existed to a slight extent, and where it,\r\ntoo, was an importation. If, however, it is correct to assume that\r\nSaivism had its origin to the northward of the Himalayas, among the\r\nTartar tribes of these regions, there is no difficulty in understanding\r\nits presence in Bengal to the extent to which it is found to prevail\r\nthere. But, on the other hand, nothing can be more natural than that an\r\naboriginal Naga people, who worshipped trees and serpents, should become\r\nBuddhists, as Buddhism was originally understood, and, being Buddhists,\r\nshould slide downwards into the corruptions of the present Vaishnava\r\nform of faith, which is avowedly that most fashionable and most\r\nprevalent in the north of India.\r\n\r\nOne of the most startling facts brought out by the last census, is the\r\ndiscovery that nearly one-third of the population of Eastern Bengal are\r\nMahomedan--20,500,000 out of 66,000,000--while in the north-west\r\nprovinces the Mahomedans are less than 1-6th--4,000,000 among\r\n25,000,000; and in Oude little more than 1-10th. It thus looks more like\r\na matter of feeling than of race; it seems that as the inhabitants of\r\nBengal were Buddhists, and clung to that faith long after it had been\r\nabolished in other parts of India, they came in contact with the Moslem\r\nreligion before they had adopted the modern form of Vishnuism, and\r\nnaturally preferred a faith which acknowledged no caste, and freed them\r\nfrom the exactions and tyranny of a dominant priesthood. The Mahomedan\r\nreligion is in fact much more like Buddhism than are any of the modern\r\nHindu forms, and when this non-Aryan casteless population came in\r\ncontact with it, before they had adopted the new faith, and were free to\r\nchoose, after the mysterious evaporation of their old beliefs, they\r\nnaturally adopted the religion most resembling that in which they had\r\nbeen brought up. It is only in this way that it seems possible to\r\naccount for the predominance of the Moslem faith in Lower Bengal and in\r\nthe Punjab, where the followers of the Prophet outnumber the Hindus, in\r\nthe proportion of 3 to 2, or as 9,000,000 to 6,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhere Buddhism had prevailed the choice seemed to lie between Vishnu or\r\nMahomet. Where Saivism crept in was apparently among those races who\r\nwere Turanians, or had affinities with the Tartar races, who immigrated\r\nfrom the north between the Christian era, and the age of the Mahomedan\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nTo most people these may appear as rash generalisations, and at the\r\npresent stage of the inquiry would be so in reality, if no further proof\r\ncould be afforded. After reading the following pages, I trust most of\r\nthem at least will be found to rest on the firm basis of a fair\r\ninduction from the facts brought forward. It might, consequently, have\r\nappeared more logical to defer these statements to the end of the work,\r\ninstead of placing them at the beginning. Unless, however, they are read\r\nand mastered first, a great deal that is stated in the following pages\r\nwill be unintelligible, and the scope and purpose of the work can be\r\nneither understood nor appreciated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1.

Stone, in those days, seems to have been employed only for the\r\nfoundations of buildings, or in engineering works, such as city walls\r\nand gates, or bridges or embankments; all else, as will appear from the\r\nsequel, were framed in carpentry. Much as we may now regret this, as all\r\nthese buildings have consequently perished, it is not so clear, as it\r\nmay at first appear, that the Indians were wrong in this, inasmuch as,\r\nin all respects, except durability, wood is a better building material\r\nthan stone. It is far more easily cut and carved, larger spaces can be\r\ncovered with fewer and less cumbrous points of support than is possible\r\nwith stone, and colour and gilding are much more easily applied to wood\r\nthan to stone. For the same outlay twice the space can be covered, and\r\nmore than twice the splendour obtained by the use of the more perishable\r\nmaterial, the one great defect being that it is ephemeral. It fails also\r\nin producing that impression of durability which is so essential to\r\narchitectural effect; while, at the same time, the facility with which\r\nit can be carved and adorned tends to produce a barbaric splendour far\r\nless satisfactory than the more sober forms necessitated by the\r\nemployment of the less tractable material.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it will, if I mistake not, become quite clear when we\r\nexamine the earliest “rock-cut temples” that, whether from ignorance or\r\nfrom choice, the Indians employed wood, and that only in the\r\nconstruction of their ornamental buildings, before Asoka’s time.[44]\r\nFrom this the inference seems inevitable that it was in consequence of\r\nIndia being brought into contact with the western world, first by\r\nAlexander’s raid, and then by the establishment of the Bactrian kingdom\r\nin its immediate proximity, that led to this change. We do not yet know\r\nprecisely how early the Bactrian kingdom extended to the Indus, but we\r\nfeel its influence on the coinage, on the sculpture, and generally on\r\nthe arts of India, from a very early date, and it seems as if before\r\nlong we shall be able to fix with precision not only the dates, but the\r\nforms in which the arts of the Western world exerted their influence on\r\nthose of the East. This, however, will be made clearer in the sequel. In\r\nthe meanwhile it may be sufficient to state here that we know absolutely\r\nnothing of the temples or architecture of the various peoples or\r\nreligions who occupied India before the rise of Buddhism,[45] and it is\r\nonly by inference that we know anything of that of the Buddhists before\r\nthe age of Asoka. From that time forward, however, all is clear and\r\nintelligible; we have a sufficient number of examples whose dates and\r\nforms are known to enable us to write a perfectly consecutive history of\r\nthe Buddhist style during the 1000 years it was practised in India, and\r\nthence to trace its various developments in the extra Indian countries\r\nto which it was carried, and where it is still practised at the present\r\nday.[46]\r\n\r\nIf our ethnography is not at fault, it would be in vain to look for any\r\nearlier architecture of any importance in India before Asoka’s time. The\r\nAryans, who were the dominant people before the rise of Buddhism, were\r\nessentially a non-artistic race. They wrote books and expressed their\r\nideas in words like their congeners all the world over, but they nowhere\r\nseem successfully to have cultivated the æsthetic arts, or to have\r\nsought for immortality through the splendour or durability of their\r\nbuildings. That was always the aspiration of the less intellectual\r\nTuranian races, and we owe it to this circumstance that we are enabled\r\nto write with such certainty the history of their rise and fall as\r\nevidenced in their architectural productions.\r\n\r\nThere is no _à priori_ improbability that the Dravidian races of the\r\nsouth of India, or the indigenous races of the north, may not have\r\nerected temples or other buildings at a very early date, but if so, all\r\nthat can be said is that all trace of them is lost. When we first meet\r\nthe Buddhist style it is in its infancy--a wooden style painfully\r\nstruggling into lithic forms--and we have no reason to suppose that the\r\nother styles were then more advanced. When, however, we first meet them,\r\nsome six or seven centuries afterwards, they are so complete in all\r\ntheir details, and so truly lithic in their forms, that they have\r\nhitherto baffled all attempts to trace them back to their original\r\ntypes, either in the wood or brick work, from which they may have been\r\nderived. So completely, indeed, have all the earlier examples been\r\nobliterated, that it is now doubtful whether the missing links can ever\r\nbe replaced. Still, as one single example of a Hindu temple dating\r\nbefore the Christian Era might solve the difficulty, we ought not to\r\ndespair of such being found, while the central provinces of India remain\r\nso utterly unexplored as they now are. Where, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, we ought to look for them, would be among the ruins of\r\nthe ancient cities which once crowded the valley of the Ganges; but\r\nthere the ruthless Moslem or the careless Hindu have thoroughly\r\nobliterated all traces of any that may ever have existed. In the remote\r\nvalleys of the Himalaya, or of Central India, there may, however, exist\r\nremains which will render the origin and progress of Hindu architecture\r\nas clear and as certain as that of the Buddhist; but till these are\r\ndiscovered, it is with the architecture of the Buddhist that our history\r\nnaturally begins. Besides this, however, from the happy accident of the\r\nBuddhists very early adopting the mode of excavating their temples in\r\nthe living rock, their remains are imperishably preserved to us, while\r\nit is only too probable that those of the Hindu, being in less durable\r\nforms, may have disappeared. The former, therefore, are easily\r\nclassified and dated, while the origin of the latter, for the present,\r\nseems lost in the mist of the early ages of Indian arts. Meanwhile, the\r\nknowledge that the architectural history of India commences B.C. 250,\r\nand that all the monuments now known to us are Buddhist for at least\r\nfive or six centuries after that time, are cardinal facts that cannot be\r\ntoo strongly insisted upon by those who wish to clear away a great deal\r\nof what has hitherto tended to render the subject obscure and\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of description it will probably be found expedient to\r\nclassify the various objects of Buddhist art under the five following\r\ngroups, though of course it is at times impossible to separate them\r\nentirely from one another, and sometimes two or more of them must be\r\ntaken together as parts of one monument.\r\n\r\n1st. _Stambhas, or Lâts._--These pillars are common to all the styles of\r\nIndian architecture. With the Buddhists they were employed to bear\r\ninscriptions on their shafts, with emblems or animals on their capitals.\r\nWith the Jains they were generally Deepdans, or lamp-bearing pillars;\r\nwith the Vaishnavas they as generally bore statues of Garuda or Hunaman;\r\nwith the Saiva they were flag-staffs; but, whatever their destination,\r\nthey were always among the most original, and frequently the most\r\nelegant, productions of Indian art.\r\n\r\n2nd. _Stupas, or Topes._--These, again, may be divided into two classes,\r\naccording to their destination: first, the true Stupas or towers erected\r\nto commemorate some event or mark some sacred spot dear to the followers\r\nof the religion of Buddha: secondly, Dagobas, or monuments containing\r\nrelics of Buddha, or of some Buddhist saint.[47] If it were possible,\r\nthese two ought always to be kept separate, but no external signs have\r\nyet been discovered by which they can be distinguished from one another,\r\nand till this is so, they must be considered, architecturally at least,\r\nas one.\r\n\r\n3rd. _Rails._--These have recently been discovered to be one of the most\r\nimportant features of Buddhist architecture. Generally they are found\r\nsurrounding Topes, but they are also represented as enclosing sacred\r\ntrees, temples, and pillars, and other objects. It may be objected that\r\ntreating them separately is like describing the peristyle of a Greek\r\ntemple apart from the cella. The Buddhist rail, however, in early ages\r\nat least, is never attached to the tope, and is used for so many other,\r\nand such various purposes, that it will certainly tend to the clearness\r\nof what follows if they are treated separately.\r\n\r\n4th. _Chaityas,[48] or Assembly Halls._--These in Buddhist art\r\ncorrespond in every respect with the churches of the Christian\r\nreligion. Their plans, the position of the altar or relic casket, the\r\naisles, and other peculiarities are the same in both, and their uses are\r\nidentical, in so far as the ritual forms of the one religion resemble\r\nthose of the other.\r\n\r\n5th. _Viharas, or Monasteries._--Like the Chaityas, these resemble very\r\nclosely the corresponding institutions among Christians. In the earlier\r\nages they accompanied, but were detached from, the Chaityas or churches.\r\nIn later times they were furnished with chapels and altars in which the\r\nservice could be performed independently of the Chaitya halls, which may\r\nor may not be found in their proximity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. Sri seated on a Lotus, with two Elephants pouring\r\nwater over her. (From a modern sculpture from Indore.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSTAMBHAS OR LÂTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether we ought to claim a wooden origin for these, as\r\nwe can for all the other objects of Buddhist architecture. Certain it\r\nis, however, that the lâts of Asoka, with shafts averaging twelve\r\ndiameters in height, are much more like wooden posts than any forms\r\nderived from stone architecture, and in an age when wooden pillars were\r\ncertainly employed to support the roofs of halls, it is much more likely\r\nthat the same material should be employed for the purposes to which\r\nthese stambhas were applied, than the more intractable material of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThe oldest authentic examples of these lâts that we are acquainted with,\r\nare those which King Asoka set up in the twenty-seventh year after his\r\nconsecration--the thirty-first of his reign--to bear inscriptions\r\nconveying to his subjects the leading doctrines of the new faith he had\r\nadopted. The rock-cut edicts of the same king are dated in his twelfth\r\nyear, and convey in a less condensed form the same information--Buddhism\r\nwithout Buddha--but inculcating respect to parents and priests, kindness\r\nand charity to all men, and, above all, tenderness towards animals.[49]\r\n\r\nThe best known of these lâts is that set up by Feroze Shah, in his\r\nKotila at Delhi, without, however, his being in the least aware of the\r\noriginal purpose for which it was erected, or the contents of the\r\ninscription. A fragment of a second was recently found lying on\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. Lât at Allahabad.]\r\n\r\nthe ground near Hindu Rao’s house, north of Delhi.[50] Two others exist\r\nin Tirhoot at Radhia, and Mattiah, and a fragment of another was\r\nrecognised utilised as a roller for the station roads, by an utilitarian\r\nmember of the Bengal Civil Service. The most complete, however, is that\r\nwhich, in 1837, was found lying on the ground in the fort at Allahabad,\r\nand then re-erected with a pedestal, from a design by Captain Smith.[51]\r\nThis pillar is more than usually interesting, as in addition to the\r\nAsoka inscriptions it contains one by Samudra Gupta (A.D. 380 to 400),\r\ndetailing the glories of his reign, and the great deeds of his\r\nancestors.[52] It seems again to have been thrown down, and was\r\nre-erected, as a Persian inscription tells us, by Jehangir (A.D. 1605),\r\nto commemorate his accession. It is represented without the pedestal\r\n(Woodcut No. 3). The shaft, it will be observed, is more than 3 ft. wide\r\nat the base, diminishing to 2 ft. 2 in. at the summit, which in a length\r\nof 33 ft.[53] looks more like the tapering of the stem of a tree--a\r\ndeodar pine, for instance--than anything designed in stone. Like all the\r\nothers of this class, this lât has lost its crowning ornament, which\r\nprobably was a Buddhist emblem--a wheel or the trisul ornament[54]--but\r\nthe necking still remains (Woodcut No. 4), and is almost a literal\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. Assyrian honeysuckle ornament from capital of Lât, at\r\nAllahabad.]\r\n\r\ncopy of the honeysuckle ornament we are so familiar with as used by the\r\nGreeks with the Ionic order. In this instance, however, it is hardly\r\nprobable that it was introduced direct by the Greeks, but is more likely\r\nto have been borrowed from its native country Assyria, whence the\r\nGreeks also originally obtained it. The honeysuckle ornament, again,\r\noccurs as the crowning member of a pillar at Sankissa, in the Doab,\r\nhalf-way between Muttra and Canouge (Woodcut No. 5), and this time\r\nsurmounting a capital of so essentially Persepolitan a type, that there\r\ncan be little doubt that the design of the whole capital came from\r\nCentral Asia. This pillar, which is of a much stouter and shorter\r\nproportion than the edict lâts, is surmounted by an elephant, but so\r\nmutilated that even in the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen\r\nThsang mistook it for a lion, if this is indeed the effigy he was\r\nlooking at, as General Cunningham supposes,[55] which, however, is by no\r\nmeans so clear as might at first sight appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. Capital at Sankissa. (From a Drawing by Gen.\r\nCunningham.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. Capital of Lât in Tirhoot. (From a Drawing by the late\r\nCapt. Kittoe.)]\r\n\r\nAnother capital of a similar nature to that last described crowns a lât\r\nat Bettiah in Tirhoot--this time surmounted by a lion of bold and good\r\ndesign (Woodcut No. 6). In this instance, however, the honeysuckle\r\nornament is replaced by the more purely Buddhist ornament of a flock of\r\nthe sacred hansas or geese. In both instances there are cable ornaments\r\nused as neckings, and the bead and reel so familiar to the student of\r\nclassical art. The last named form is also, however, found at\r\nPersepolis. These features it may be remarked are only found on the lâts\r\nof Asoka, and are never seen afterwards in India, though common in\r\nGandhara and in the Indus for long afterwards, which seems a tolerably\r\nclear indication that it was from Persia, though probably on a\r\nsuggestion from the Greeks, that he obtained those hints which in India\r\nled to the conversion of wooden architecture into stone. After his\r\ndeath, these classical features disappear, and wooden forms resume their\r\nsway, though the Persian form of capital long retained its position in\r\nIndian art.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that each of these Asoka lâts stood in front\r\nof, or in connection with some stupa, or building of some sort; but all\r\nthese have disappeared, and the lâts themselves have--some of them at\r\nleast--been moved more than once, so that this cannot now be proved. So\r\nfar, however, as can now be ascertained, one or two stambhas stood in\r\nfront of, or beside each gateway of every great tope, and one or two in\r\nfront of each chaitya hall. At least we know that six or seven can now\r\nbe traced at Sanchi, and nearly an equal number at Amravati,[56] and in\r\nthe representation of topes at the latter place, these lâts are\r\nfrequently represented both outside and inside the rails.\r\n\r\nAt Karli, one still stands in front of the great cave surmounted by four\r\nlions, which, judging from analogy, once bore a chakra or wheel,\r\nprobably in metal.[57] A corresponding pillar probably once stood on the\r\nopposite side of the entrance bearing some similar emblem. Two such are\r\nrepresented in these positions in front of the great cave at Kenheri,\r\nwhich is an exact but debased copy of the great Karli cave.[58]\r\n\r\nThe two lâts at Erun and the iron pillar at Delhi, though similar in\r\nmany respects to those just described, seem certainly to belong to the\r\nera of the Guptas at the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth\r\ncentury of our era, and to be dedicated to the Vaishnava faith, and in\r\nconsequence belong to a subsequent chapter. That at Pathari is not\r\ninscribed or is at least unedited, and though it looks old, may also be\r\nof the Gupta times.\r\n\r\nThis is a meagre account, it must be confessed, of Buddhist lâts, which\r\nprobably at one time could be counted by hundreds in the important\r\nBuddhist localities in Bengal; but it is feared we shall hardly be able\r\nto add many more to our list. They are so easily overthrown and so\r\nreadily utilised in populous localities, that all trace of most of them\r\nhas probably been irrecoverably lost, though one or two more examples\r\nmay probably be found in remote, out-of-the-way places.\r\n\r\nThere is no instance, so far as I am aware, of a built monumental pillar\r\nnow standing in India. This is sufficiently accounted for by the ease\r\nwith which they could be thrown down and their materials removed, when\r\nthey had lost the sanctity which alone protected them. There are,\r\nhowever, two such pillars among the topes of Cabul, and evidently coeval\r\nwith them, now called the Surkh Minar (Woodcut No. 7), and the Minar\r\nChakri. These are ascribed by the traditions of the place to Alexander\r\nthe Great, though they are evidently Buddhist monuments, meant to mark\r\nsome sacred spot, or to commemorate some event, the memory of which has\r\npassed away. There can be little doubt that their upper members are\r\nmeant to be copies of the tall capitals of the Persepolitan pillars,\r\nwhich were probably common also in Assyria, and throughout this part of\r\nAsia, but their shape and outline exhibit great degeneracy from the\r\npurer forms with which that architecture commenced in India, and which\r\nwere there retained in their purity to a much later period than in this\r\nremote province. No reliable data seem to exist for ascertaining what\r\nthe age of these monuments may be. It probably was the third or fourth\r\ncentury of our era, or it may be even earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. Surkh Minar, Cabul. (From a Drawing by Mr. Masson, in\r\nWilson’s ‘Ariana Antiqua.’)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSTUPAS.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nBhilsa Topes--Topes at Sarnath and in Behar--Amravati Tope--Gandhara\r\nTopes--Jelalabad Topes--Manikyala Tope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few subjects of like nature that would better reward the\r\nlabour of some competent student than an investigation into the origin\r\nof Relic Worship and its subsequent diffusion over the greater part of\r\nthe old world. So far as is at present known, it did not exist in Egypt,\r\nnor in Greece or Rome in classical times, nor in Babylon or Assyria. In\r\nsome of these countries the greatest possible respect was shown to the\r\nremains of departed greatness, and the bones and ashes of persons who\r\nwere respected in life were preserved with care and affection; but there\r\nwas no individual so respected that a hair of his head, a tooth, or a\r\ntoe-nail, even a garment or a utensil he had used, was considered as a\r\nmost precious treasure after his death. In none of these countries does\r\nit appear to have occurred to any one that a bone or the begging-pot of\r\na deceased saint was a thing worth fighting for; or that honour done to\r\nsuch things was a meritorious act, and that prayers addressed to them\r\nwere likely to be granted. Yet so ingrained do these sentiments appear\r\nto be among the followers of Buddha, that it is difficult to believe\r\nthat the first occasion on which this sentiment arose, was at the\r\ndistribution of his remains on his attaining Nirvana at Kusinagara, B.C.\r\n543. On that occasion, eight cities or kingdoms are said to have\r\ncontended for the honour of possessing his mortal remains, and the\r\ndifficulty was met by assigning a portion to each of the contending\r\nparties, who are said to have erected stupas to contain them in each of\r\ntheir respective localities.[59] None of these can now be identified\r\nwith certainty--everything in future ages being ascribed to Asoka, who,\r\naccording to popular tradition, is said to have erected the fabulous\r\nnumber of 84,000 relic shrines, or towers to mark sacred spots.[60] Some\r\nof these may be those we now see, or are encased within their domes; but\r\nif so, they, like everything else architectural in India, are the\r\nearliest things we find there. It is true, the great pagoda--the Shewé\r\nDagon--at Rangoon is said to contain relics of all the four Buddhas of\r\nthe present Kalpa, the staff of Kakasanda; the water-dipper of\r\nKonagamma; the bathing garment of Kasyapa, and eight hairs from the head\r\nof Gautama Buddha;[61] but supposing this to be true, we only now see\r\nthe last and most modern, which covers over the older erections. This is\r\nat least the case with the great Dagoba at Bintenne, near Kandy, in\r\nCeylon, in which the thorax-bone of the great ascetic lies enshrined.\r\nThe ‘Mahawanso,’ or great Buddhist history of Ceylon, describes the mode\r\nin which this last building was raised, by successive additions, in a\r\nmanner so illustrative of the principle on which these relic shrines\r\narrived at completion, that it is well worth quoting:--“The chief of the\r\nDevos, Sumano, supplicated of the deity worthy of offerings for an\r\noffering. The Vanquisher, passing his hand over his head, bestowed on\r\nhim a handful of his pure blue locks from the growing hair of the head.\r\nReceiving and depositing it in a superb golden casket, on the spot where\r\nthe divine teacher had stood, he enshrined the lock in an emerald\r\ndagoba, and bowed down in worship.\r\n\r\n“The thero Sarabhu, at the demise of the supreme Buddha, receiving at\r\nhis funeral pile the Thorax-bone, brought and deposited it in that\r\nidentical dagoba. This inspired personage caused a dagoba to be erected\r\n12 cubits high to enshrine it, and thereon departed. The younger brother\r\nof King Devenampiatisso (B.C. 259), having discovered this marvellous\r\ndagoba, constructed another encasing it, 30 cubits in height. King\r\nDuttagamini (B.C. 161), while residing there, during his subjugation of\r\nthe Malabars, constructed a dagoba, encasing that one, 80 cubits in\r\nheight.” This was the “Mahiyangana dagoba completed.”[62] It is possible\r\nthat at each successive addition some new deposit was made; at least\r\nmost of the topes examined in Afghanistan and the Punjab, which show\r\nsigns of these successive increments, seem also to have had successive\r\ndeposits, one above the other.\r\n\r\nOf all the relics of Buddha, the most celebrated is the left canine\r\ntooth. At the original distribution it is said to have fallen to the lot\r\nof Orissa, and to have been enshrined in a town called from that\r\ncircumstance “Dantapura.” This, most probably, was the modern town of\r\nPuri, and the celebrated temple of Juggernath, which now flourishes\r\nthere, not only in all probability occupies the same spot, but the\r\nworship now celebrated there is the same, _mutato nomine_, as that which\r\nwas once performed in honour of this tooth. Be this as it may, it seems\r\nto have remained there in peace for more than eight centuries, when the\r\nking of the country, being attracted by some miracles performed by it,\r\nand the demeanour of the priests, became converted from the Brahmanical\r\nfaith, to which he had belonged, to the religion of Buddha. The\r\ndispossessed Brahmans thereon complain to his suzerain lord, resident at\r\nPalibothra, in the narrative called only by his title Pandu, but almost\r\ncertainly the Gautamiputra of the Andrabhitya dynasty. He ordered the\r\ntooth to be brought to the capital, when, from the wonders it exhibited,\r\nhe was converted also; but this, and the excitement it caused, led to\r\nits being ultimately conveyed surreptitiously to Ceylon, where it\r\narrived about the year 311;[63] and in spite of various vicissitudes\r\nstill remains in British custody, the Palladium of the kingdom, as it\r\nhas done during the last fifteen centuries and a half.[64]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time (A.D. 324[65]) another tooth of Buddha was enshrined\r\nin a tope on the island of Salsette, in Bombay harbour, apparently in\r\nthe time of the same Gautamiputra, but what its subsequent fate was is\r\nnot known.[66] When the tope was opened for Dr. Bird, it was not there,\r\nbut only a copper plate, which recorded its enshrinement, by a noble\r\nlayman called Pushyavarman.[67]\r\n\r\nAlmost as celebrated as these was the begging-pot of Sakya Muni, which\r\nwas long kept in a dagoba or vihara erected by Kanishka at Peshawur, and\r\nworshipped with the greatest reverence.[68] After paying a visit to\r\nBenares,[69] it was conveyed to Kandahar, and is still said to be\r\npreserved there by the Mussulmans, and looked upon even by them as a\r\nmost precious relic.[70]\r\n\r\nAll this will become plainer as we proceed, for we shall find every\r\nBuddhist locality sanctified by the presence of relics, and that these\r\nwere worshipped apparently from the hour of the death of the founder of\r\nthe religion to the present day. Were this the place to do it, it would\r\nbe interesting to try and trace the path by which, and the time when,\r\nthis belief in the efficacy of relics spread towards the west, and how\r\nand when it was first adopted by the early Christian Church, and became\r\nwith them as important an element of worship as with the Buddhists. That\r\nwould require a volume to itself; meanwhile, what is more important for\r\nour present purpose is the knowledge that this relic-worship gave rise\r\nto the building of these great dagobas, which are the most important\r\nfeature of Buddhist architectural art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo one can, I fancy, hesitate in believing that the Buddhist dagoba is\r\nthe direct descendant of the sepulchral tumulus of the Turanian races,\r\nwhether found in Etruria, Lydia, or among the Scyths of the northern\r\nsteppes. The Indians, however, never seem to have buried, but always to\r\nhave burnt, their dead, and consequently never, so far as we know, had\r\nany tumuli among them. It may be in consequence of this that the\r\ndagobas, even in the earliest times, took a rounded or domical form,\r\nwhile all the tumuli, from being of earth, necessarily assumed the form\r\nof cones. Not only out of doors, but in the earliest caves, the forms of\r\ndagobas are always rounded; and no example of a straight-lined cone\r\ncovering a dagoba has yet been discovered. This peculiarity, being so\r\nuniversal, would seem to indicate that they had been long in use before\r\nthe earliest known example, and that some other material than earth had\r\nbeen employed in their construction; but we have as yet no hint when the\r\nrounded form was first employed, nor why the conical form of the tumulus\r\nwas abandoned when it was refined into a relic shrine. We know, indeed,\r\nfrom the caves, and from the earliest bas-reliefs, that all the roofs of\r\nthe Indians were curvilinear; and if one can fancy a circular chamber\r\nwith a domical roof--not in stone, of course--as the original receptacle\r\nof the relic, we may imagine that the form was derived from this.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nBHILSA TOPES.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive, and taking it altogether, perhaps the most\r\ninteresting, group of topes in India is that known as the Bhilsa Topes,\r\nfrom a town of that name in the kingdom of Bhopal, near which they are\r\nsituated. There, within a district not exceeding ten miles east and west\r\nand six north and south, are five or six groups of topes, containing\r\naltogether between twenty-five and thirty individual examples. The\r\nprincipal of these, known as the great tope at Sanchi, has been\r\nfrequently described, the smaller ones are known from General\r\nCunningham’s descriptions only;[72] but altogether they have excited so\r\nmuch attention that they are perhaps better known than any group in\r\nIndia. We are not however, perhaps, justified in assuming, from the\r\ngreater extent of this group, as now existing, that it possessed the\r\nsame pre-eminence in Buddhist times. If we could now see the topes that\r\nonce adorned any of the great Buddhist sites in the Doab or the Behars,\r\nthe Bhilsa group might sink into insignificance. It may only be, that\r\nsituated in a remote and thinly-peopled part of India, they have not\r\nbeen exposed to the destructive energy of opposing sects of the Hindu\r\nreligion, and the bigoted Moslem has not wanted their materials for the\r\nerection of his mosques. They consequently remain to us, while it may be\r\nthat nobler and more extensive groups of monuments have been swept from\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been written about them, we know very\r\nlittle that is certain regarding their object and their history. Our\r\nusual guides, the Chinese Pilgrims, fail us here. Fa Hian never was\r\nwithin some hundreds of miles of the place; and if Hiouen Thsang ever\r\nwas there, it was after leaving Ballabhi, when his journal becomes so\r\nwild and curt that it is always difficult, sometimes impossible, to\r\nfollow him. He has, at all events, left no description by which we can\r\nnow identify the place, and nothing to tell us for what purpose the\r\ngreat tope or any of the smaller ones were erected. The ‘Mahawanso,’ it\r\nis true, helps us a little in our difficulties. It is there narrated\r\nthat Asoka, when on his way to Ujjéni (Ujjain), of which place he had\r\nbeen nominated governor, tarried some time at Chétyagiri, or, as it is\r\nelsewhere called, Wessanagara, the modern Besnagar, close to Sanchi. He\r\nthere married Devi, the daughter of the chief, and by her had twin sons,\r\nUjjenio and Mahindo, and afterwards a daughter, Sanghamitta. The two\r\nlast named entered the priesthood, and played a most important part in\r\nthe introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon. Before setting out on this\r\nmission, Mahindo visited his royal mother at Chétyagiri, and was lodged\r\nin “a superb vihara,” which had been erected by herself.[73] In all this\r\nthere is no mention of the great tope, which may have existed before\r\nthat time; but till some building is found in India which can be proved\r\nto have existed before that age, it will be safe to assume that this is\r\none of the 84,000 topes said to have been erected by him. Had Sanchi\r\nbeen one of the eight cities which obtained relics of Buddha at the\r\nfuneral pyre, the case might have been different; but it has been dug\r\ninto, and found to be a stupa, and not a dagoba. It consequently was\r\nerected to mark some sacred spot or to commemorate some event, and we\r\nhave no reason to believe that this was done anywhere before Asoka’s\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. Relic Casket of Moggalana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. Relic Casket of Sariputra.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand two smaller topes on the same platform contained\r\nrelics of an undoubted historical character. That called No. 2 Tope\r\ncontained those of ten Buddhist teachers who took part in the third\r\ngreat convocation held under Asoka, and some of whom were sent on\r\nmissions to foreign countries, to disseminate the doctrines then\r\nsettled, and No. 3 Tope contained two relic caskets, represented in the\r\naccompanying woodcuts (Nos. 8 and 9). One of these contained relics of\r\nMaha Moggalana, the other of Sariputra, friends and companions of Buddha\r\nhimself, and usually called his right and left hand disciples.[74] It\r\ndoes not of course follow from this that this dagoba is as old as the\r\ntime of Buddha; on the contrary, some centuries must elapse before a\r\nbone or rag belonging to any mortal becomes so precious that a dome is\r\nerected to enshrine it. The great probability seems to be that these\r\nrelics were deposited there by Asoka himself, in close proximity to the\r\nsacred spot, which the great tope was erected to commemorate. The tope\r\ncontaining relics of his contemporaries must of course be much more\r\nmodern, probably contemporary with the gateways, which are subsequent to\r\nthe Christian Era.[75]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. View of the great Tope at Sanchi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. Plan of great Tope at Sanchi.\r\n\r\nScale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. Section of great Tope at Sanchi.\r\n\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the Sanchi Tope will be understood from the\r\nview of it on Woodcut No. 10, and its shape and arrangement from the\r\nplan and section, Nos. 11 and 12. From these it will be observed that\r\nthe principal building consists of a dome somewhat less than a\r\nhemisphere, 106 ft. in diameter, and 42 ft. in height.[76]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. Tee cut in the rock on a Dagoba at Ajunta.]\r\n\r\nOn the top of the tope is a flat space about 34 ft. in diameter,\r\nformerly surrounded by a stone railing, some parts of which are still\r\nlying there; and in the centre of this once stood a feature known to\r\nIndian archæologists as a Tee. The woodcut (No. 13), from a rock-cut\r\nexample at Ajunta, represents the usual form at this age. The lower part\r\nis adorned with the usual Buddhist rail (to be described hereafter), the\r\nupper by the conventional window, two features which are universal. It\r\nis crowned by a lid of three slabs, and no doubt either was or simulated\r\na relic casket. No tope, and no representation of a tope--and we have\r\nhundreds--are without this feature, and generally it is or was\r\nsurmounted by one or more discs representing the umbrellas of state; in\r\nmodern times by as many as nine of these. The only ancient wooden one\r\nnow known to exist is that in the cave at Karli (Woodcut No. 56), but\r\nthe representations of them in stone and painting are literally\r\nthousands in number.\r\n\r\nThe dome rests on a sloping base, 14 ft. in height by 120 ft. in\r\ndiameter, having an offset on its summit about 6 ft. wide. This, to\r\njudge from the representations of topes on the sculptures, must have\r\nbeen surrounded by a balustrade, and was ascended by a broad double ramp\r\non one side. It was probably used for processions round the monument,\r\nwhich seem to have been among the most common Buddhist ceremonials. The\r\ncentre of this great mound is quite solid, being composed of bricks laid\r\nin mud; but the exterior is faced with dressed stones. Over these was\r\nlaid a coating of cement nearly 4 inches in thickness, which was, no\r\ndoubt, originally adorned either with painting or ornaments in relief.\r\n\r\nBeside the group at Sanchi, which comprises six or seven topes, there\r\nare at Sonari, six miles distant, another group of eight topes. Two of\r\nthese are important structures, enclosed in square courtyards, and one\r\nof these yielded numerous relics to the explorers.\r\n\r\nAt Satdhara, three miles further on, is a great tope 101 ft. in\r\ndiameter, but which, like that at Sanchi, seems to have been a stupa,\r\nand yielded no relics. No. 2, however, though only 24 ft. in diameter,\r\nwas found to contain relics of Sariputra and Moggalana, like No. 3 at\r\nSanchi. Besides these there are several others, all small, and very much\r\nruined.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous group, however, is situated at Bhojpur, seven miles\r\nfrom Sanchi, where thirty-seven distinct topes are grouped together on\r\nvarious platforms. The largest is 66 ft. in diameter, but No. 2 is\r\ndescribed as one of the most perfect in the neighbourhood, and, like\r\nseveral others in this group, contained important relics.\r\n\r\nAt Andher, about five miles west of Bhojpur, is a fine group of three\r\nsmall, but very interesting topes. With those above enumerated, this\r\nmakes up about sixty distinct and separate topes, in this small\r\ndistrict, which certainly was not one of the most important in India in\r\na religious point of view, and consequently was probably surpassed by\r\nmany, not only in the number but in the splendour of its religious\r\nedifices.[77]\r\n\r\nWithout more data than we at present possess, it is of course impossible\r\nto speak with certainty with regard to the age of this group of topes,\r\nbut, so far as can be at present ascertained, there seems no reason for\r\nassuming that any of them are earlier than the age of Asoka, B.C. 250,\r\nnor is it probable that any of them can be of later date than the era of\r\nSalivahana, A.D. 79, or say after the first century of our era. Their\r\nrails may be later, but the topes themselves seem all to be included\r\nwithin these three centuries and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPES AT SARNATH AND IN BEHAR.\r\n\r\nNot only is there no other group of topes in India Proper that can be\r\ncompared, either in extent or in preservation, to those of Bhilsa, but\r\nour knowledge of the subject is now so complete that it is probably safe\r\nto assert that only two, or at most three, topes exist between the\r\nSutlej and the sea, sufficiently perfect to enable their form and\r\narchitectural features to be distinguished. There are, of course,\r\nnumerous mounds near all the Buddhist cities which mark the site, and\r\nmany of which probably hide the remains, of some of the hundreds of\r\nstupas or dagobas mentioned by the Chinese Pilgrims, besides many that\r\nthey failed to distinguish. All, however, with the fewest possible\r\nexceptions, have perished; nor is it difficult to see why this should be\r\nso. All, or nearly all, were composed of brick or small stones, laid\r\neither without mortar, or with cement that was little better than mud.\r\nThey consequently, when desecrated and deserted, formed such convenient\r\nquarries for the villagers, that nearly all have been utilised for\r\nbuilding huts and houses of the Hindus, or the mosques of the\r\niconoclastic Mussulmans. Their rails, being composed of larger stones\r\nand not so easily removed, have in some instances remained, and some\r\nwill no doubt be recovered when looked for; and as these, in the earlier\r\nages at least, were the iconostasis of the shrine, their recovery will\r\nlargely compensate for the loss of the topes which they surrounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. Tope at Sarnath, near Benares. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe best known, as well as the best preserved of the Bengal topes, is\r\nthat at Sarnath, near Benares (Woodcut No. 14). It was carefully\r\nexplored by General Cunningham in 1835-36, and found to be a stupa:\r\nviz., containing no relics, but erected to mark some spot sanctified by\r\nthe presence of Buddha, or by some act of his during his long residence\r\nthere. It is situated in the Deer Park, where he took up his residence\r\nwith his five disciples when he first removed from Gaya on attaining\r\nBuddhahood, and commencing his mission as a teacher. What act it\r\ncommemorates we shall probably never know, as there are several mounds\r\nin the neighbourhood, and the descriptions of the Chinese Pilgrims are\r\nnot sufficiently precise to enable us now to discriminate between them.\r\n\r\nThe building consists of a stone basement, 93 ft. in diameter, and\r\nsolidly built, the stones being clamped together with iron to the height\r\nof 43 ft. Above that it is in brickwork, rising to a height of 110 ft.\r\nabove the surrounding ruins, and 128 ft. above the plain.[78] Externally\r\nthe lower part is relieved by eight projecting faces, each 21 ft. 6 in.\r\nwide, and 15 ft. apart. In each is a small niche, intended apparently to\r\ncontain a seated figure of Buddha, and below them, encircling the\r\nmonument, is a band of sculptured ornament of the most exquisite beauty.\r\nThe central part consists--as will be seen by the cut on the next\r\npage--of geometric patterns of great intricacy, but combined with\r\nsingular skill; and, above and below, foliage equally well designed, and\r\nso much resembling that carved by Hindu artists on the earliest\r\nMahomedan mosques at Ajmir and Delhi, as to make us feel sure they\r\ncannot be very distant in date.\r\n\r\nThe carvings round the niches and on the projections have been left so\r\nunfinished--in some instances only outlined--that it is impossible to\r\nguess what ultimate form it may have been intended to give them. The\r\nupper part of the tower seems never to have been finished at all, but\r\nfrom our knowledge of the Afghanistan topes we may surmise that it was\r\nintended to encircle it with a range of pilasters, and then some bold\r\nmouldings, before covering it with a hemispherical dome.\r\n\r\nIn his excavations, General Cunningham found, buried in the solid\r\nmasonry, at the depth of 10½ ft. from the summit, a large stone on\r\nwhich was engraved the usual Buddhist formula, “Ye dharmma hetu,” &c.,\r\nin characters belonging to the 7th century, from which he infers that\r\nthe monument belongs to the 6th century. To me it appears so extremely\r\nimprobable that men should carefully engrave such a formula on a stone,\r\nand then bury it ten or twelve feet in a mass of masonry which they must\r\nhave hoped would endure for ever, that I cannot accept the conclusion.\r\nIt seems to me much more probable that it may have belonged to some\r\nbuilding which this one was designed to supersede, or to have been the\r\npedestal of some statue which had been disused, but which from its age\r\nhad become venerable, and was consequently utilised to sanctify this\r\nnew erection. I am consequently much more inclined to adopt the\r\ntradition preserved by Captain Wilford,[79] to the effect that the\r\nSarnath monument was erected by the sons of Mohi Pala, and destroyed\r\n(interrupted?) by the Mahomedans, in 1017, before its completion.[80]\r\nThe form of the monument, the character of its sculptured ornaments, the\r\nunfinished condition in which it is left, and indeed the whole\r\ncircumstances of the case, render this date so much the most probable\r\nthat I feel inclined to adopt it almost without hesitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. Panel on the Tope at Sarnath. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe other Bengal tope existing nearly entire is known as Jarasandha Ka\r\nBaithak. General Cunningham state its dimensions to be 28 ft. in\r\ndiameter by 21 ft. in height, resting on a basement 14 ft. high, so that\r\nits total height, when complete, may have been about 55 ft.[81] As it\r\nwas not mentioned by Fa Hian, A.D. 400, and is by Hiouen Thsang, A.D.\r\n640, its age is probably, as General Cunningham states, intermediate\r\nbetween these dates, or about A.D. 500.[82] It is a bold, fine tower,\r\nevidently earlier than that at Sarnath, and showing nothing of the\r\ntendency towards Hindu forms there displayed. It has, too, the remains\r\nof a procession-path, or extended basement, which is wholly wanting at\r\nSarnath, but which is always found in the earlier monuments. It was\r\nerected, as Hiouen Thsang tells us, in honour of a Hansa--goose--who\r\ndevoted itself to relieve the wants of a starving community of\r\nBhikshus.[83]\r\n\r\nThe third stupa, if it may be so called, is the celebrated temple at\r\nBuddh Gaya, which stands immediately in front of the celebrated\r\nBodhi-tree (_Ficus religiosa_)[84] under whose shade Buddha attained\r\ncomplete enlightenment in the thirty-fifth year of his age, B.C. 588.\r\nIts history is told in such detail by Hiouen Thsang[85] that there seems\r\nlittle doubt as to the main facts of the case. According to this\r\nauthority, Asoka built a small vihara here, but long afterwards this was\r\nreplaced by a temple 160 ft. high and 60 ft. (20 paces) wide, which are\r\nthe exact dimensions of the present building, according to\r\nCunningham,[86] and we are further told that it was erected by a\r\nBrahman, who was warned by Maheswara (Siva), in a vision, to execute\r\nthis work. In this temple there was a cella corresponding with the\r\ndimensions of that found there, in which the Brahman placed a statue of\r\nBuddha, seated cross-legged, with one hand pointing to the earth. Who\r\nthis Brahman was we learn from an inscription translated by Mr. Wilkins\r\nin vol. i. of the ‘Asiatic Researches’ (p. 284), for it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that the Brahman of the Chinese pilgrim is identical with the\r\nAmara Deva of the inscription, who was one of the ornaments of the court\r\nof Vicramaditya of Malwa, A.D. 495-530. From a Burmese inscription on\r\nthe spot, first translated by Colonel Burney, we further learn that the\r\nplace, having fallen into decay, was restored by the Burmese in the year\r\n1306-1309.[87]\r\n\r\nFrom the data these accounts afford us we gather, with very tolerable\r\ncertainty, that the building we now see before us (Woodcut No. 16) is\r\nsubstantially that erected by Amara the Brahman, in the beginning of the\r\n6th century, but the niches Hiouen Thsang saw, containing golden statues\r\nof Buddha, cannot be those now existing, and the sculptures he mentions\r\nfind no place in the present design; and the amalakas of gilt copper\r\nthat crowned the whole, as he saw it, have disappeared. The changes in\r\ndetail, as well as the introduction of radiating arches in the interior,\r\nI fancy must belong to the Burmese restoration in the beginning of the\r\n14th century. Though these, consequently, may have altered its\r\nappearance in detail, it is probable that we still have before us a\r\nstraight-lined pyramidal nine-storeyed temple of the 6th century,\r\nretaining all its essential forms--anomalous and unlike anything else we\r\nfind in India, either before or afterwards, but probably the parent of\r\nmany nine-storeyed towers found beyond the Himalayas, both in China and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. Temple at Buddh Gaya with Bo-tree. (From a Photograph\r\nby Mr. Peppe, C.E.)]\r\n\r\nEventually we may discover other examples which may render this noble\r\ntower less exceptional than it now appears to be; but perhaps its\r\nanomalous features may be due to the fact that it was erected by\r\nBrahmans for Buddhist purposes in an age of extremest toleration,[88]\r\nwhen it was doubtful whether the balance would incline towards Buddhist\r\nor Brahmanical supremacy. In less than a century and a half after its\r\nerection the storm burst (A.D. 648) which eventually sealed the fate of\r\nBuddhism in Central India, with only a fitful flickering of the lamp\r\nafterwards during lulls in the tempest.\r\n\r\nAt Keseriah, in Tirhoot, about 20 miles north of Bakra, where one of the\r\npillars of Asoka mentioned above is found, are the ruins of what appears\r\nto have been a very large tope. It is, however, entirely ruined\r\nexternally, and has never been explored, so that we cannot tell what was\r\nits original shape or purpose.[89] All along this line of country\r\nnumerous Buddhist remains are found, all more or less ruined, and they\r\nhave not yet been examined with the care necessary to ascertain their\r\nforms. This is the more to be regretted as this was the native country\r\nof the founder of the religion, and the place where his doctrines appear\r\nto have been originally promulgated. If anything older than the age of\r\nAsoka is preserved in India, it is probably in this district that it\r\nmust be looked for.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMRAVATI.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a vestige remains _in situ_ of the central dagoba at\r\nAmravati, there is no great difficulty, by piecing together the\r\nfragments of it in the India Museum--as is done in Plate 93 of ‘Tree and\r\nSerpent Worship’--in ascertaining what its dimensions and general\r\nappearance were. It was small, only 30 ft. to 35 ft. in diameter, or\r\nabout 100 ft. in circumference, and 50 ft. high. The perpendicular part,\r\n34 ft. high, was covered with sculptures in low relief, representing\r\nscenes from the life of Buddha. The domical part was covered with\r\nstucco, and with wreaths and medallions either executed in relief or\r\npainted. No fragment of them remains by which it can be ascertained\r\nwhich mode of decoration was the one adopted.\r\n\r\nAltogether, there seems no doubt that the representation of a tope on\r\nthe following page (Woodcut No. 17), copied from the inner rail at\r\nAmravati, fairly represents the central building there. There were\r\nprobably forty-eight such representations of dagobas on this rail. In\r\neach the subject of the sculpture is varied, but the general design is\r\nthe same throughout; and, on the whole, the woodcut may be taken as\r\nrepresenting the mode in which a Buddhist dagoba was ornamented in the\r\n4th or 5th century, which is the time at which the style seems to have\r\nreached its highest point of elaboration, in India at least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. Representation of a Tope from the Rail at Amravati.\r\n(From a bas-relief in the India Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nGANDHARA TOPES.\r\n\r\nThe extreme paucity of examples retaining their architectural form, in\r\nthe valley of the Ganges, is, to some extent, compensated for by the\r\nexistence of a very extensive range of examples in Afghanistan and the\r\nwestern Punjab. In his memoir of these topes, published by Professor\r\nWilson, in his ‘Ariana Antiqua,’ Mr. Masson enumerates and describes, in\r\nmore or less detail, some sixty examples, or almost exactly the same\r\nnumber which General Cunningham described as existing at Bhilsa. In this\r\ninstance, however, they extend over a range of 200 miles, from Cabul to\r\nthe Indus, instead of only 16 or 17 miles from Sonari to Andher. To\r\nthese must be added some fifteen or twenty examples, found at Manikyala\r\nor in its neighbourhood, and it is probable about the same number still\r\nexist undescribed, making altogether perhaps 100 stupas in this\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this wealth of examples, we miss one, which was probably\r\nthe finest of all. When Fa Hian passed through the province in A.D. 400,\r\nhe describes the dagoba which King Kanishka had erected at Peshawur as\r\n“more than 470 ft. in height, and decorated with every sort of precious\r\nsubstance, so that all who passed by, and saw the exquisite beauty and\r\ngraceful proportions of the tower and the temple attached to it,\r\nexclaimed in delight that it was incomparable for beauty;” and he adds,\r\n“Tradition says this was the highest tower in Jambudwipa.”[90] When\r\nHiouen Thsang passed that way more than two hundred years afterwards, he\r\nreports the tower as having been 400 ft. high, but it was then\r\nruined--“the part that remained, a li and a half in circumference (1500\r\nft.) and 150 ft. high;” and he adds, in twenty-five stages of the tower\r\nthere were a “ho”--10 bushels of relics of Buddha.[91] No trace of this\r\nmonument now exists.\r\n\r\nThese north-western topes are so important for our history, and all have\r\nso much that is common among them, and are distinguished by so many\r\ncharacteristics from those of India Proper, that it would be extremely\r\nconvenient if we could find some term which would describe them without\r\ninvolving either a theory or a geographical error. The term Afghanistan\r\ntopes, by which they are generally designated, is too modern, and has\r\nthe defect of not including Peshawur and the western Punjab. “Ariana,”\r\nas defined by Professor Wilson, describes very nearly the correct limits\r\nof the province; for, though it includes Bactria and the valley of the\r\nUpper Oxus, where no topes have yet been found, we know from the Chinese\r\nPilgrims that in the 5th and 7th centuries these countries, as far as\r\nKhoten, were intensely Buddhist, and monuments must exist, and will, no\r\ndoubt, be found when looked for. The name, however, has the defect that\r\nit seems to imply the existence in that region of an Aryan people, and\r\nconsequently an Aryan religion. At the time to which he was referring,\r\nthat was no doubt the case, and therefore from the Professor’s point of\r\nview the name was correctly applied.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sanscrit-speaking races first broke up from their original\r\nsettlements in the valley of the Oxus, they passed through the valley of\r\nthe Cabul river on their way to India, and lingered, in all probability,\r\nboth there and in the Punjab before reaching their first permanent\r\nposition on the Saraswati--the true “Arya Varta”--between the Sutlej\r\nand the Jumna. It is also nearly certain that they remained the dominant\r\ncaste in these countries down to the time of Alexander’s invasion, and\r\nduring the supremacy of the Bactrian kingdom. About 130 years, however,\r\nbefore the Christian Era, if we may trust the Chinese accounts,[92] the\r\nYuechi, and other tribes of Tartar origin, were on the move in this\r\ndirection. About that time they struck down the Bactrian monarchy, and\r\nappear from thenceforward to have permanently occupied their country. It\r\nis not clear whether they immediately, or at what interval they\r\npenetrated into the Cabul valley; but between that time and the\r\nChristian Era successive hordes of Yuechi, Sakas, Turuskas, and Hunas,\r\nhad poured into the valley and the western Punjab to such an extent as\r\nto obliterate, or at least for the time supersede the Aryan population,\r\nand supplant it by one of Turanian origin, and with this change of race\r\ncame the inevitable change of religion. Turania would therefore for our\r\npurposes be a more descriptive name than Ariana; but it is not\r\nsufficiently precise or well defined. No people, so far as is known,\r\never adopted and adhered to the Buddhist religion who had not a large\r\nproportion of Turanian blood in their veins, and the name would\r\nconsequently include all the people who adopted this faith. Gandhara is,\r\non the contrary, a local name, which certainly, in early times, included\r\nthe best part of this province, and in Kanishka’s time seems to have\r\nincluded all he reigned over, and, if so, would be the most appropriate\r\nterm we could find.\r\n\r\nIt has, moreover, this advantage, that it is essentially Buddhist. In\r\nthe time of Asoka, it was Kashmir and Gandhara to which he sent his\r\nmissionaries, and from that time forward Gandhara is the term by which,\r\nin all Buddhist books, that kingdom is described, of which Taxila was\r\nthe capital, and which is, as nearly as can now be ascertained,\r\nconterminous with our architectural province.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether Kanishka was or was not the first Buddhist king\r\nof this country; but, so far as is at present known, he seems to have\r\ndone for Buddhism in Gandhara exactly what Asoka did for that religion\r\nin central India. He elevated it from its position as a struggling sect\r\nto that of being the religion of the State. We know, however, that Asoka\r\nhimself sent missionaries to this country;[93] and, more than this, that\r\nhe engraved a complete set of his edicts on a rock at Kapurdigiri, 30\r\nmiles north-east from Peshawur, but we do not know what success they or\r\nhe attained. Certain it is, as Professor Wilson remarks, that “no coin\r\nof a Greek prince of Bactria has ever been met with in any tope.”[94]\r\nThe local coins that are found in them all belong to dynasties\r\nsubsequent to the destruction of the Bactrian kingdom, and, according\r\nto the same authority (p. 322), “were selected from the prevailing\r\ncurrency, which was not of any remotely previous issue;” “while the\r\nGreek Bactrian coins had long ceased to be current, though they had not,\r\nperhaps, become so scarce as to be enshrined as rarities” (p. 44). Under\r\nthese circumstances, Professor Wilson arrives at the conclusion that the\r\ntopes “are undoubtedly all subsequent to the Christian Era” (p. 322). It\r\nis true that some of the kings whose coins are found in the topes, such\r\nas Hermæus, Azes, Kadphises, and others, may have lived prior to that\r\nepoch, but none of their coins show a trace of Buddhism. On those of the\r\nlast-named king, it is also true that we find the trisul emblem of the\r\nBuddhists on the reverse, but it is coupled with the bull and trident of\r\nSiva in so remarkable a manner that it can hardly be doubted that the\r\nmonarch was a follower of the Hindu religion, though acknowledging the\r\npresence of Buddhism in his realm.[95] With Kanishka, however, all this\r\nis altered. He was a Buddhist, beyond all doubt; he held the convocation\r\ncalled the third by the northern Buddhists--the fourth according to the\r\nsouthern--at which Nagárjuna was apparently the presiding genius. From\r\nthat time the Thibetans, Burmese, and Chinese date the introduction of\r\nBuddhism into their countries: not, however, the old simple Buddhism,\r\nknown as the Hinayana, which prevailed before, but the corrupt Mahayana,\r\nwhich was fabled to have been preserved by the Nagas from the time of\r\nBuddha’s death, and from whom Nagárjuna received it, and spread it from\r\nPeshawur over the whole of northern and eastern Asia. It was precisely\r\nthe same revolution that took place in the Christian Church, about the\r\nsame time after the death of its founder. Six hundred years after\r\nChrist, Gregory the Great established the hierarchical Roman Catholic\r\nsystem, in supersession of the simpler primitive forms. Six hundred\r\nyears after the Nirvana, Nagárjuna introduced the complicated and\r\nidolatrous Mahayna,[96] though, as we learn from the Chinese Pilgrims, a\r\nsmall minority still adhered in after times to the lesser vehicule, or\r\nHinayana system.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, we are probably safe in asserting that none of the\r\nGandhara topes date before the Christian Era, it is not because there is\r\nany inherent, _à priori_ improbability that they should date before\r\nKanishka, as there is that those of India Proper cannot extend beyond\r\nAsoka. There is no trace of wooden construction here. All is stone and\r\nall complete, and copied probably from Bactrian originals that may have\r\nexisted two centuries earlier. Their dates depend principally on the\r\ncoins, which are almost invariably found deposited with the relics, in\r\nthese topes. No coins so far as I know have been found in any Indian\r\ntope. They are found in hundreds in these north-western ones, and always\r\nfix a date beyond which the tope cannot be carried back, and generally\r\nenable us to approximate very nearly to the true date of the monument in\r\nquestion. If those of Kanishka are the earliest, which appears to be the\r\ncase, the great one which he commenced, at Manikyala, is probably also\r\nthe last to be finished in its present form, inasmuch as below 12 ft. of\r\nsolid masonry, a coin of Yasoverma of Canouge was found, and his date\r\ncannot be carried back beyond A.D. 720. Between these dates, therefore,\r\nmust be ranged the whole of this great group of Buddhist monuments.\r\n\r\nThere probably were no great Buddhist establishments in Gandhara before\r\nKanishka, and as few, if any, after Yasoverma, yet we learn that between\r\nthese dates this province was as essentially Buddhist as any part of\r\nIndia. Fa Hian tells us, emphatically, that the law of Buddha is\r\nuniversally honoured, and enumerates 500 monasteries,[97] and Hiouen\r\nThsang makes no complaint of heretics, while both dilate in ecstasies on\r\nthe wealth of relics everywhere displayed. Part of the skull, teeth,\r\ngarments, staffs, pots of Buddha--impressions of his feet, even his\r\nshadow--was to be seen in this favoured district, which was besides\r\nsanctified by many actions which had been commemorated by towers erected\r\non the spot where these meritorious acts were performed. Many of these\r\nspots have been identified, and more will no doubt reward the industry\r\nof future investigators, but meanwhile enough is known to render this\r\nprovince one of the most interesting of all India for the study of the\r\ntraditions or art of Mediæval Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThe antiquities of the western part of the province were first\r\ninvestigated by Dr. Honigberger, in the years 1833-34,[98] and the\r\nresult of his numismatic discoveries published in Paris and elsewhere;\r\nbut the only account we have of the buildings themselves is that given\r\nby Mr. Masson, who, with singular perseverance and sagacity, completed\r\nwhat Dr. Honigberger had left undone.[99] Those of the eastern district\r\nand about Manikyala were first investigated by General Ventura and M.\r\nCourt, officers in the service of Runjeet Sing, and the result of their\r\nresearches published by Prinsep in the third volume of his ‘Journal’ in\r\n1830; but considerably further light has been thrown on them by the\r\nexplorations of General Cunningham, and published in his ‘Archæological\r\nReports’ for 1863-1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nJELALABAD TOPES.\r\n\r\nThe topes examined and described by Mr. Masson as existing round\r\nJelalabad are thirty-seven in number, viz., eighteen distinguished as\r\nthe Darunta group, six at Chahar Bagh, and thirteen at Hidda. Of these\r\nabout one-half yielded coins and relics of more or less importance,\r\nwhich proved the dates of their erection to extend from the Christian\r\nEra, or it may be a few years before it, to the 7th or 8th century.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of these is No. 10 of Hidda, which contained,\r\nbesides a whole museum of gems and rings, five gold solidi of the\r\nemperors Theodosius (A.D. 408), Marcian and Leo (474); two gold Canouge\r\ncoins; and 202 Sassanian coins extending to, if not beyond, the\r\nHegira.[100] This tope, therefore, must belong to the 7th century, and\r\nwould be a most convenient landmark in architectural history, were it\r\nnot that the whole of its exterior is completely peeled off, so that no\r\narchitectural mouldings remain, and, apparently from the difficulty of\r\nascertaining them, no dimensions are quoted in the text.[101] About\r\none-half of the others contained relics, but none were found to be so\r\nrich as this.\r\n\r\nIn general appearance they differ considerably from the great Indian\r\ntopes just described, being all taller in proportion to their breadth,\r\nand having a far more tower-like appearance, than any found in India,\r\nexcept the Sarnath example. They are also smaller, the largest at\r\nDarunta being only 160 ft. in circumference. This is about the usual\r\nsize of the first-class topes in Afghanistan, the second class being a\r\nlittle more than 100 ft., while many are much smaller.\r\n\r\nIn almost every instance they seem to have rested on a square base,\r\nthough in many this has been removed, and in others it is buried in\r\nrubbish. Above this rises a circular base or drum, crowned by a belt\r\nsometimes composed merely of two architectural string-courses, with\r\ndifferent coloured stones disposed as a diaper pattern between them.\r\nSometimes a range of plain pilasters occupies this space. More generally\r\nthe pilasters are joined by arches sometimes circular, sometimes of an\r\nogee form. In one instance--the Red Tope--they are alternately circular\r\nand three-sided arches. That this belt represents the enclosing rail at\r\nSanchi and the pilastered base at Manikyala cannot be doubted. It\r\nshows, however, a very considerable change in style to find it elevated\r\nso far up the monument as it here is, and so completely changed from its\r\noriginal purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18. Tope at Bimeran. (From a Drawing by Mr. Masson, in\r\nWilson’s ‘Ariana Antiqua.’)]\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the dome or roof rises immediately above this, but\r\nno example in this group retains its termination in a perfect state.\r\nSome appear to have had hemispherical roofs, some more nearly conical,\r\nof greater or less steepness of pitch; and some (like that represented\r\nin Woodcut No. 18) were probably flat, or with only a slight elevation\r\nin the centre. It seems probable there may have been some connection\r\nbetween the shape of the roof and the purpose for which the tope was\r\nraised. But we have no evidence to lead us to any decision of this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19. Tope, Sultanpore. (From a Drawing by Mr. Masson, in\r\nWilson’s ‘Ariana Antiqua.’)]\r\n\r\nOne interesting peculiarity was brought to light by Mr. Masson in his\r\nexcavation of the tope at Sultanpore, and is shown in the annexed\r\nsection (Woodcut No. 19). It is proved that the monument originally\r\nconsisted of a small tope on a large square base, with the relic placed\r\non its summit. This was afterwards increased in size by a second tope\r\nbeing built over it.\r\n\r\nBesides those already mentioned there are about twenty or thirty topes\r\nin the neighbourhood of Cabul, but all much ruined, and few of any\r\nstriking appearance. So at least we are led to infer from Mr. Masson’s\r\nvery brief notice of them. No doubt many others still remain in spots\r\nhitherto unvisited by Europeans.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of all these topes are found caves and tumuli,\r\nthe former being the residences of priests, the latter for the most part\r\nburying-places, perhaps in some instances smaller relic-shrines. Their\r\nexact destination cannot be ascertained without a careful investigation\r\nby persons thoroughly conversant with the subject. There are still,\r\nhowever, many points of great interest which require to be cleared up by\r\nactual examination. When this has been done we may hope to be able to\r\njudge with some certainty of their affinity with the Indian buildings on\r\nthe one hand, and those of Persia on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANIKYALA.\r\n\r\nThe most important group, however, of the Gandhara topes is that at\r\nManikyala in the Punjab, situated between the Indus and the Jelum or\r\nHydaspes. Fifteen or twenty examples are found at this place, most of\r\nwhich were opened by General Ventura and M. Court about the year 1830,\r\nwhen several of them yielded relics of great value, though no record has\r\nbeen preserved of the greater part of their excavations. In one opened\r\nby M. Court, a square chamber was found at a height of 10 ft. above the\r\nground level. In this was a gold cylinder enclosed in one of silver, and\r\nthat again in one of copper. The inner one contained four gold coins,\r\nten precious stones and four pearls. These were, no doubt, the relics\r\nwhich the tope was intended to preserve. The inscription has only\r\npartially been read, but certainly contains the name of Kanishka,[102]\r\nso that we may feel assured it was erected during his reign. Some Roman\r\ncoins were found much worn, as if by long use,[103] before they reached\r\nthis remote locality; and, as they extend down to a date 33 B.C.,[104]\r\nit is certain the monument was erected after that date. The gold coins\r\nwere all those of Kanishka. This tope, therefore, could hardly have been\r\nerected earlier than twenty years before Christ; how much later, we will\r\nbe able to say only when we know more of the date and history of the\r\nmonarch to whom it owes its origin. To the antiquary the inquiry is of\r\nconsiderable interest, but less so to the architect, as the tope is so\r\ncompletely ruined that neither its form nor its dimensions can now be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nAnother was recently opened by General Cunningham, in the relic chamber\r\nof which he found a copper coin, belonging to the Satrap Zeionises, who\r\nis supposed to have governed this part of the country about the\r\nChristian Era, and we may therefore assume that the tope was erected by\r\nhim or in his time. This and other relics were enclosed in a glass\r\nstoppered vessel, placed in a miniature representation of the tope\r\nitself, 4½ in. wide at base, and 8½ in. high (Woodcut No. 20),\r\nwhich may be considered as a fair representation of what a tope was or\r\nwas intended to be, in that day. It is, perhaps, taller, however, than\r\na structural example would have been; and the tee, with its four\r\numbrellas, is, no doubt, exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20. Relic casket from Tope at Manikyala. (Found and drawn\r\nby Gen. Cunningham.[105])]\r\n\r\nThe principal tope of the group is, perhaps, the most remarkable of its\r\nclass in India, though inferior in size to several in Ceylon. It was\r\nfirst noticed by Mountstuart Elphinstone, and a very correct view of it\r\npublished by him, with the narrative of his mission to Cabul in 1815. It\r\nwas afterwards thoroughly explored by General Ventura, in 1830, and a\r\ncomplete account of his investigations published by Prinsep in the third\r\nvolume of his ‘Journal.’ Since then its basement has been cleared of the\r\nrubbish that hid it to a depth of 12 ft. to 15 ft. all round by the\r\nofficers of the Public Works Department. They also made careful plans\r\nand sections of the whole, manuscript copies of which are now before me.\r\n\r\nFrom those it appears that the dome is an exact hemisphere, 127 ft. in\r\ndiameter, and consequently, as nearly as may be, 400 ft. in\r\ncircumference. The outer circle measures in like manner 159 ft. 2 in.,\r\nor 500 ft. in circumference, and is ascended by four very grand flights\r\nof steps, one in each face, leading to a procession-path 16 ft. in\r\nwidth, ornamented both above and below by a range of dwarf pilasters,\r\nrepresenting the detached rail of the older Indian monuments. It is,\r\nindeed, one of the most marked characteristics of these Gandhara topes,\r\nthat none of them possess, or ever seem to have possessed, any trace of\r\nan independent rail; but all have an ornamental belt of pilasters,\r\njoined generally by arches simulating the original rail. This can hardly\r\nbe an early architectural form, and leads to the suspicion that, in\r\nspite of their deposits, their outward casing may be very much more\r\nmodern than the coins they contain.\r\n\r\nThe outward appearance of the Manikyala tope, in its present half-ruined\r\nstate, may be judged of from the view (Woodcut No. 21). All that it\r\nreally requires to complete its outline is the tee, which was an\r\ninvariable adjunct to these buildings; no other feature has wholly\r\ndisappeared. The restored elevation, half-section, half-elevation\r\n(Woodcut No. 22), to the usual scale, 50 ft. to 1 in., will afford the\r\nmeans of comparison with other monuments; and the section and elevation\r\nof the base (Woodcut No. 23, next page) will explain its architectural\r\ndetails in so far as they can be made out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21. View of Manikyala Tope. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22. Restored Elevation of the Tope at Manikyala. Scale 50\r\nft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nOn digging into this monument, General Ventura found three separate\r\ndeposits of relics, deposited at apparently equal distances of 25 ft.\r\nfrom the surface of the finished monument and from each other, and each\r\napparently increasing in value or importance as it descended. The first\r\nwas at the base of a solid cubical mass of squared masonry, and\r\ncontained, _inter alia_, some Sassanian coins and one of Yasoverma (A.D.\r\n720), and one of Abdullah ben Hassim, struck at Merv A.H. 66, or A.D.\r\n685.[106] The second, at a depth of 50 ft., contained no coins. The\r\nprincipal deposit, at a depth of 75 ft., was on the exact level of the\r\nprocession-path outside. It consisted of a copper vessel, in which was a\r\nrelic casket in brass, represented in the annexed woodcut (No. 24),\r\ncontaining a smaller vessel of gold, filled with a brown liquid, and\r\nwith an inscription on the lid which has not yet been fully deciphered,\r\nbut around it were one gold and six copper coins of the Kanishka type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23. Elevation and Section of Portion of Basement of Tope\r\nat Manikyala.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24. Relic Casket, Manikyala.]\r\n\r\nIf this were all, it would be easy to assert that the original smaller\r\ntope, as shown in the section (Woodcut No. 22), was erected by Kanishka,\r\nor in his age, and that the square block on its summit was the original\r\ntee, and that in the 8th century an envelope 25 ft. in thickness, but\r\nfollowing the original form, was added to it, and with the extended\r\nprocession-path it assumed its present form, which is very much lower\r\nthan we would otherwise expect from its age.\r\n\r\nAgainst this theory, however, there is an ugly little fact. It is said\r\nthat a fragment[107] or, as it is printed, three Sassanian coins were\r\nfound at a depth of 64 ft. (69 ft. from the finished surface); and if\r\nthis were so, as the whole masonry was found perfectly solid and\r\nundisturbed from the surface to the base, the whole monument must be of\r\nthe age of this coin. As engraved, however, it is such a fragment[108]\r\nthat it seems hardly sufficient to base much upon it. Unless the General\r\nhad discovered it himself, and noted it at the time, it might so easily\r\nhave been mislabelled or mixed up with other Sassanian fragments\r\nbelonging to the upper deposits that its position may be wrongly\r\ndescribed. If, however, there were three, this explanation will not\r\nsuffice. It may, however, be that the principal deposit was accessible,\r\nas we know was sometimes the case[109] in this instance, at the bottom\r\nof an open well-hole or side gallery, before the time of the rebuilding\r\nin the 8th century, and was then, and then only, built up solid. If,\r\nhowever, neither of these explanations suffice, the Manikyala tope is a\r\nmystery and a riddle I cannot unravel. If we may disregard this deposit,\r\nits story seems self-evident as above explained. But whatever its\r\ninternal arrangements may have been, it seems perfectly certain that its\r\npresent external appearance is due to a rebuilding in the early part of\r\nthe 8th century.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cunningham identifies M. Court’s tope as the Huta Murta, one of\r\nthe most celebrated topes in the province, erected to commemorate\r\nBuddha, in a previous stage of existence, offering his body to appease\r\nthe hunger of a tiger, and--according to another version--of its seven\r\nfamishing cubs;[110] but, as before remarked, nothing of its exterior\r\ncoating now remains. Unfortunately, the same is true of all the other\r\nfifteen topes at this place, and, what is worse, of all the fifty or\r\nfifty-five which can still be identified at Taxila. As General\r\nCunningham remarks, of all these sixty or seventy stupas there is not\r\none, excepting the great Manikyala tope, that retains in its original\r\nposition a single wrought stone of its outer facing;[111] none,\r\nconsequently, are entitled to a longer notice in a work wholly devoted\r\nto architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRAILS.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nRails at Bharhut, Muttra, Sanchi, and Amravati.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only recently that our rapidly-increasing knowledge has enabled us\r\nto appreciate the important part which Rails play in the history of\r\nBuddhist architecture. The rail of the great Tope at Sanchi has, it is\r\ntrue, been long known; but it is the plainest of those yet discovered,\r\nand without the inscriptions which are found on it, and the gateways\r\nthat were subsequently added to it, presents few features to interest\r\nany one. There is a second rail at Sanchi which is more ornamented and\r\nmore interesting, but it has not yet been published in such a manner as\r\nto render its features or its history intelligible. The same is at least\r\npartially true of the great rail at Buddh Gaya, though it is one of the\r\noldest and finest of its kind. When, however, the Amravati sculptures\r\nwere brought to light and pieced together,[112] it was perceived that\r\nthe rail might, and in that instance did, become one of the most\r\nelaborate and ornamental features of the style. Since then General\r\nCunningham has found two or three buried rails at Muttra, and his\r\ncrowning discovery of the great rail at Bharhut, has made it clear that\r\nthis was the feature on which the early Buddhist architects lavished all\r\nthe resources of their art, and from the study of which we may\r\nconsequently expect to learn most.\r\n\r\nThe two oldest rails of which we have any knowledge in India are those\r\nat Buddh Gaya and that recently discovered at Bharhut. The former,\r\nGeneral Cunningham thinks, cannot be of much later date than Asoka.[113]\r\nThe latter, in his ‘Memorandum,’[114] he ascribes to the age of that\r\nmonarch. These determinations he founds principally on the form of the\r\ncharacters used in the inscriptions on them, which certainly are nearly\r\nidentical with those used on the lâts. From them, and the details of the\r\nsculptures, it is quite evident they cannot be far removed in age from\r\nthe dates so assigned to them. On the whole, however, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that the Buddh Gaya rail was really erected by Asoka, or during\r\nhis reign. At all events, we know from the fifteenth chapter of the\r\n‘Mahawanso’ that even if he did not worship this tree, he certainly\r\nreverenced it to such an extent that when he sent his daughter\r\nSangamitta to aid in the conversion of Ceylon to the true faith, he cut\r\noff and entrusted her with a branch of this tree planted in a golden\r\nvessel. That tree was replanted with infinite ceremony at Anuradhapura,\r\nand it, or its lineal descendant, remains the principal _numen_ of the\r\nisland to this day. Hiouen Thsang tells us that Asoka built a small\r\nvihara to the east of the tree on the spot where the present temple\r\nstands;[115] and nothing is consequently more probable than he should\r\nhave added this rail, which is concentric with his vihara, but not with\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nThere certainly is no inherent improbability that he should have done\r\nso, for it seems hardly doubtful that this was the tree under whose\r\nshade Sakya Muni attained “complete enlightenment,” or, in other words,\r\nreached Buddhahood; and no spot consequently could be considered more\r\nsacred in the eyes of a Buddhist, or was more likely to be reverenced\r\nfrom the time forward.\r\n\r\nThe Bharhut rail, according to the inscription on it, was erected by a\r\nPrince Vâdha Pala, son of Raja Dhanabhuti,--a name we cannot recognise\r\nin any list, but hardly could have been contemporary with the\r\nall-powerful and all-pervading rule of Asoka, and must consequently have\r\nbeen subsequent, as no such works were, so far as we now know, erected\r\nin India before his day. The ultimate determination of the relative\r\ndates of these two monuments will depend on a careful comparison of\r\ntheir sculptures, and for that the materials do not exist in this\r\ncountry. I have, thanks to the kindness of General Cunningham, a nearly\r\ncomplete set of photographs of the Bharhut sculptures, but not one of\r\nthe Buddh Gaya rail. It is true the drawings by Major Kittoe, in the\r\nIndia House Library, are very much better than those published by\r\nGeneral Cunningham in his report;[116] but they do not suffice for this\r\npurpose. In so far, however, as the evidence at present available\r\nenables us to judge, it seems nearly certain that the Bharhut sculptures\r\nare half a century nearer those of the gateways at Sanchi than those at\r\nBuddh Gaya are; and consequently we may, for the present at least,\r\nassume the Buddh Gaya rail to be 250 B.C., that at Bharhut 200 B.C., and\r\nthe gateways at Sanchi to range from 10 to say 70 or 80 A.D.[117]\r\n\r\nThe Buddh Gaya rail is a rectangle, measuring 131 ft. by 98 ft., and is\r\nvery much ruined. Its dimensions were, indeed, only obtained by\r\nexcavation. The pillars are apparently only 5 ft. 11 in. in height, and\r\nare generally ornamented with a semi-disc top and bottom, containing a\r\nsingle figure, or a group of several. They have also a central circular\r\ndisc, with either an animal or bust in the centre of a lotus. No part of\r\nthe upper rail seems to have been recovered, and none of the\r\nintermediate rails between the pillars are sculptured. As the most\r\nancient sculptured monument in India, it would be extremely interesting\r\nto have this rail fully illustrated,[118] not so much for its artistic\r\nmerit as because it is the earliest authentic monument representing\r\nmanners and mythology in India. Its religion, as might be expected, is\r\nprincipally Tree and Serpent worship, mingled with veneration for\r\ndagobas, wheels, and Buddhist emblems. The domestic scenes represent\r\nlove-making, and drinking,--anything, in fact, but Buddha or Buddhism,\r\nas we afterwards come to understand the term.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25. Tree Worship: Buddh Gaya Rail.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26. Relic Casket: Buddh Gaya Rail.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBHARHUT.\r\n\r\nWhatever interest may attach to the rail at Buddh Gaya, it is surpassed\r\nten times over by that of the newly-discovered rail at Bharhut,\r\nwhich, taking it all in all, is perhaps the most interesting\r\nmonument--certainly in a historical point of view--known to exist in\r\nIndia. The tope itself, which seems to have been 68 ft. in diameter, has\r\nentirely disappeared, having been utilised by the natives to build their\r\nvillages; but about one-half of the rail, which was partly thrown down\r\nand buried in the rubbish, still remains. Originally it was 88 ft. in\r\ndiameter, and consequently some 275 ft. in length. It was divided into\r\nfour quadrants by the four entrances, each of which was guarded by\r\nstatues 4½ ft. high, carved in relief in the corner pillars of\r\nYakshas and Yakshinis, and Naga Rajas--the representatives, in fact, of\r\nthose peoples who afterwards became Buddhists. The eastern gateway only\r\nseems to have been adorned with a Toran--or, as the Chinese would call\r\nit, a “Pailoo”--like those at Sanchi. One pillar of it is shown in the\r\nfollowing woodcut, (No. 27), and sufficient fragments were found in the\r\nexcavations to enable General Cunningham to restore it with almost\r\nabsolute certainty. From his restoration it appears to have been 22 ft.\r\n6 in. in height from the ground to the top of the chakra, or wheel,\r\nwhich was the central emblem on the top of all, supported by a\r\nhoneysuckle ornament of great beauty. The beams had no human figures on\r\nthem, like those at Sanchi. The lower had a procession of elephants,\r\nbringing offerings to a tree; the middle beam, of lions similarly\r\nemployed; the upper beam has not been recovered, but the beam-ends are\r\nornamented with conventional crocodiles, and show elevations of\r\nbuildings so correctly drawn as to enable us to recognise all their\r\nfeatures in the rock-cut edifices now existing.\r\n\r\nThe toran, most like this one, is that which surmounted the southern\r\nentrance at Sanchi, which, for reasons given elsewhere,[119] I believe\r\nto be not only the oldest of the four found there, but to have been\r\nerected in the first quarter of the first century of our era (A.D. 10 to\r\n28). This one, however, is so much more wooden than even that and\r\nconstructively so inferior, that I would, on architectural grounds\r\nalone, be inclined to affirm that it was at least a century older, and\r\nsee no reason why it should not be two centuries more ancient. The age\r\nof the rail, however, does not depend on this determination, as the\r\ntoran may have been added afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe rail was apparently 9 ft. in height, including the coping, and had\r\nthree discs on intermediate rails. The inner side of the upper rail was\r\nornamented by a continuous series of bas-reliefs, divided from each\r\nother by a beautiful flowing scroll. The inside also of the discs was\r\nsimilarly ornamented, and some of the pillars had bas-reliefs in three\r\nstoreys on three of their sides. Altogether, I fancy not less than one\r\nhundred separate bas-reliefs have been recovered, all representing some\r\nscene or legend of the time, and nearly all inscribed not only with the\r\nnames of the principal persons represented, but with the title of the\r\njataka or legend, so that they are easily recognised in the books now\r\ncurrent in Buddhist countries.\r\n\r\nIt is the only monument in India that is so inscribed, and it is this\r\nthat consequently gives it such value for the history not only of art\r\nbut of Buddhist mythology.[120]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27. Portion of Rail at Bharhut, as first uncovered. (From\r\na Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nIf this work professed to be a history of Indian art, including\r\nsculpture, it would be necessary to illustrate this rail to a much\r\ngreater extent than is attempted; but as architecturally it is hardly\r\nmore important than others, that task may well be left to its\r\ndiscoverer. Meanwhile, however, it cannot be too strongly insisted upon\r\nthat the art here displayed is purely indigenous. There is absolutely no\r\ntrace of Egyptian influence. It is, indeed, in every detail antagonistic\r\nto that art; nor is there any trace of classical art; nor can it be\r\naffirmed that anything here exhibited could have been borrowed directly\r\nfrom Babylonia or Assyria. The capitals of the pillars do resemble\r\nsomewhat those at Persepolis, and the honeysuckle ornaments point in the\r\nsame direction; but, barring that, the art, especially the\r\nfigure-sculpture belonging to the rail, seems an art elaborated on the\r\nspot by Indians, and by Indians only.[121]\r\n\r\nAssuming these facts to be as stated, they give rise to one or two\r\ninferences which have an important bearing on our investigations. First,\r\nthe architecture of this rail, with its toran, are more essentially\r\nwooden than even those at Sanchi, and, so far as it goes, tends to\r\nconfirm the conclusion that, at the period they were erected, the style\r\nwas passing from wood to stone. On the other hand, however, the\r\nsculpture is so sharp and clean, and every detail so well and so\r\ncleverly expressed in the hard sandstone in which it is cut, that it is\r\nequally evident the carvers were perfectly familiar with the material\r\nthey were using. It is far from being a first attempt. They must have\r\nhad chisels and tools quite equal to carving the hardest stone, and must\r\nhave been perfectly familiar with their use. How long it may have taken\r\nthem to acquire this degree of perfection in stone carving, it is of\r\ncourse impossible to guess, without further data; but it must have been\r\ncenturies. Though, therefore, we may despair of finding any\r\narchitectural buildings older than the time of Asoka, it is by no means\r\nimprobable that we may find images or bas-reliefs, and inscriptions of a\r\nmuch earlier date, and for the history of India and her arts they would\r\nbe as useful as the larger examples. They, like this rail, are probably\r\nburied under some neglected mound or the ruins of some forsaken city,\r\nand will only be recovered by excavation or by accident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28. Tree and Serpent Worship at Bharhut. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nFor the present we must be content with the knowledge, that we now know\r\nperfectly what the state of the arts was in India when the Greeks first\r\nvisited it. Neither the Buddh Gaya nor the Bharhut rails were, it is\r\ntrue, in existence in Alexander’s time; but both were erected within the\r\nlimits of the century in which Megasthenes visited the country, as\r\nambassador from Seleucus, and it is principally from him that we know\r\nwhat India was at that time. If he did not see these monuments he must\r\nhave seen others like them, and at all events saw carvings executed in\r\nthe same style, and wooden chaityas and temples similar to those\r\ndepicted in these sculptures. But one of the curious points they bring\r\nout is, that the religious observances he witnessed at the courts of the\r\nBrahmanical king, Chandragupta, are not those he would have witnessed\r\nhad he been deputed to his Buddhist grandson the great Asoka. There, as\r\neverywhere else at this age, everything is Buddhist, but it is Buddhism\r\nwithout Buddha. He nowhere appears, either as a heavenly person to be\r\nworshipped, or even as an ascetic. The nearest indication of his\r\npresence is in a scene where Ajatasatra--the king in whose reign he\r\nattained Nirvana--kneels before an altar in front of which are\r\nimpressions of his feet. His feet, too, seem impressed on the step of\r\nthe triple ladder, by which he descended from Heaven at Sankissa; Maya’s\r\ndream, and the descent of the white Elephant can be recognised, and\r\nother indications sufficient to convince an expert that Buddhism is the\r\nreligion indicated. But, as at Sanchi, by far the most numerous objects\r\nto which worship is addressed in these sculptures, are trees, one of\r\nwhich, the inscription tells us, is the Bodhi-tree of Sakya Muni.\r\nBesides this, the Bo-trees of six or seven of his predecessors are\r\nrepresented in these sculptures, and both by their foliage and their\r\ninscriptions we can easily recognise them as those known at the present\r\nday as belonging to these previous Buddhas.[122]\r\n\r\nNaga people, and kings with their five-headed serpent-hoods are common;\r\nbut only one instance has yet been brought to light in which the serpent\r\ncan be said to be worshipped. Making love and drinking are not\r\nrepresented here as at Sanchi--nor are females represented nude as they\r\nare at Muttra. All are decently clothed, from the waist downwards at\r\nleast, and altogether the manners and customs at Bharhut are as much\r\npurer as the art is better than it is in the more modern example at\r\nSanchi.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTRA.\r\n\r\nWhen excavating at Muttra, General Cunningham found several pillars of a\r\nrail, which, judging from the style, is most probably of about the same\r\nage as that at Bharhut, or it may be a little more modern, but still\r\ncertainly anterior to the Christian Era. The pillars, however, are only\r\n4½ ft. high, and no trace of the top rail nor of the intermediate\r\ndiscs has been found. Each pillar is adorned by a figure of a naked\r\nfemale in high relief, singularly well executed, richly adorned with\r\nnecklaces and bangles, and a bead belt or truss round their middles.\r\nEach stands on a crouching dwarf, and above each, in a separate\r\ncompartment, are the busts of two figures, a male and female, on a\r\nsomewhat smaller scale, either making violent love to each other, or\r\ndrinking something stronger than water.[123]\r\n\r\nThough the sculptures at Sanchi and Cuttack have made us familiar with\r\nsome strange scenes, of what might be supposed an anti-Buddhistical\r\ntendency, this rail can hardly be Buddhist. We do not, indeed, know if\r\nit was straight or circular, or to what class of building it was\r\nattached. If part of a palace, it would be unobjectionable. But if it\r\nbelonged to a temple, it ought to have been dedicated to Krishna, not to\r\nBuddha. It is not, indeed, impossible that a form of Vishnuism may have\r\nco-existed with Buddhism in the neighbourhood of Bindrabun, even at this\r\nearly age. But these are problems, the existence of which is only just\r\ndawning upon us, and which cannot be investigated in a work like the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANCHI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 29. Rail at Sanchi. (From a Drawing by Gen. Cunningham.)]\r\n\r\nThough the rails surrounding the topes at Sanchi are not, in themselves,\r\nso interesting as those at Buddh Gaya and Bharhut, still they are useful\r\nin exhibiting the various steps by which the modes of decorating rails\r\nwere arrived at, and the torans or gateways of the great rail are quite\r\nunequalled by any other examples known to exist in India. The rail that\r\nsurrounds the great tope may be described as a circular enclosure 140\r\nft. in diameter, but not quite regular, being elliptical on one side, to\r\nadmit of the ramp or stairs leading to the berm or procession-path\r\nsurrounding the monument. As will be seen from the annexed woodcut (No.\r\n29), it consists of octagonal pillars 8 ft. in height, and spaced 2 ft.\r\napart. These are joined together at the top by a rail 2 ft. 3 in. deep,\r\nheld in its position by a tenon cut on the top of the pillars, as at\r\nStonehenge; between the pillars are three intermediate rails, which are\r\nslipped into lens-shaped holes, on either side, the whole showing how\r\nessentially wooden the construction is. The pillars, for instance, could\r\nnot have been put up first, and the rails added afterwards. They must\r\nhave been inserted into the right or left hand posts, and supported\r\nwhile the next pillar was pushed laterally, so as to take their ends,\r\nand when the top rail was shut down the whole became mortised together\r\nas a piece of carpentry, but not as any stone-work was done, either\r\nbefore or afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30. Rail, No. 2 Tope, Sanchi. (From a Drawing by Colonel\r\nMaisey.)]\r\n\r\nThe next stage in rail design is exemplified in that of No. 2 Tope,\r\nSanchi (Woodcut No. 30); there circular discs are added in the centre of\r\neach pillar, and semicircular plates at top and bottom. In carpentry the\r\ncircular ones would represent a great nail meant to keep the centre bar\r\nin its place; the half discs, top and bottom, metal plates to strengthen\r\nthe junctions--and this it seems most probably may really have been the\r\norigin of these forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 31. Representation of Rail. (From a Bas-relief at\r\nAmravati.)]\r\n\r\nIf from this we attempt to follow the progress made in the ornamentation\r\nof these rails, it seems to have been arrived at by placing a circular\r\ndisc in each of the intermediate rails, as shown in the woodcut (No.\r\n31), copied from a representation of the outer face of the Amravati\r\nrail, carved upon it. In the actual rail the pillars are proportionally\r\ntaller and the spaces somewhat wider, but in all other respects it is\r\nthe same--it has the same zöophorus below, and the same conventional\r\nfigures bearing a roll above, both which features are met with almost\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32. Rail in Gautamiputra Cave, Nassick.]\r\n\r\nA fourth stage was reached in that shown in the next woodcut (No. 32),\r\nfrom a representation of a rail in the Gautamiputra cave at Nassick,\r\nA.D. 312 to 333, where there are three full discs on the pillars as well\r\nas on the rails, and no doubt other variations may yet be found; but\r\nthese are sufficient to show how the discs were multiplied till the\r\npillars almost become evanescent quantities in the composition.\r\n\r\nThe greatest innovation, however, that took place, was the substitution\r\nof figure-sculpture for the lotus or water leaves of the discs, if that\r\ncan be called an innovation, which certainly took place in the wooden\r\nage of architecture, before it was thought of translating these things\r\ninto stone. The earliest rails we know, those at Buddh Gaya and Bharhut,\r\nshow these changes already completed in the manner above described. The\r\nplainness of the rail, or the absence of figure-sculpture, is\r\nconsequently no test of its greater or less antiquity, though the\r\nextreme multiplication of discs, as shown in the last example, seems\r\nonly to have taken place just before their discontinuance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return, however, from this digression. The rail that surrounds the\r\ngreat tope at Sanchi was probably commenced immediately after its\r\nerection, which, as explained above, was probably in Asoka’s time, B.C.\r\n250; but as each rail, as shown by the inscription on it, was the gift\r\nof a different individual,[124] it may have taken 100 or 150 years to\r\nerect. The age of the torans is more easily ascertained. There is an\r\ninscription on the south gateway, which is certainly integral, which\r\nstates that the gateway was erected during the reign of a Sat Karni\r\nking, and it is nearly certain that this applies to a king of that name\r\nwho reigned A.D. 10 to 28. As this gateway is certainly the oldest of\r\nthe four, it gives us a starting-point from which to determine the age\r\nof the others. The next that was erected was the northern. That was\r\nfollowed by the eastern--the one of which there is a cast at South\r\nKensington--and the last erected was the western. The style and details\r\nof all those show a succession and a progress that could hardly have\r\ntaken place in less than a century, and, with other reasons, enable us\r\nto assert without much hesitation, that the four gateways were added to\r\nthe rail of the great tope during the first century of the Christian\r\nEra, and their execution spread pretty evenly over that period.[125] The\r\nnorthern gateway is shown in the general view of the building (Woodcut\r\nNo. 10), but more in detail in the cut (No. 33) on the following page.\r\n\r\nIn design and dimensions these four gateways are all very similar to one\r\nanother. The northern is the finest,[126] as well as somewhat larger\r\nthan the others. Its pillars, to the underside of the lower beam,\r\nmeasure 18 ft., including the elephant capitals, and the total height to\r\nthe top of the emblem is 35 ft. The extreme width across the lower beam\r\nis 20 ft. The other gateways are somewhat less in dimensions, the\r\neastern being only 33 ft. in height. The other two having fallen, it is\r\nnot easy to be sure what their exact dimensions may have been while\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nAll these four gateways, or torans as they are properly called, were\r\ncovered with the most elaborate sculptures both in front and\r\nrear--wherever, in fact, their surface was not hidden by being attached\r\nto the rail behind them. Generally the sculptures represent scenes from\r\nthe life of Buddha when he was the Prince Siddharta, rarely, if ever,\r\nafter he became an ascetic, and nowhere is he represented in the\r\nconventional forms either standing or seated cross-legged, which\r\nafterwards became universal. In addition to these are scenes from the\r\njatakas or legends, narrating events or actions that took place during\r\nthe five hundred births through which Sakya Muni had passed before he\r\nbecame so purified as to reach perfect Buddhahood. One of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33. Northern Gateway of Tope at Sanchi. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nthese, the Wessantara, or “alms-giving Jataka,” occupies the whole of\r\nthe lower beam of the northern gateway, and reproduces all the events of\r\nthat wonderful tale exactly as it is narrated in Ceylonese books at the\r\npresent day. Besides these historical scenes, the worship of trees is\r\nrepresented at least seventy-six times; of dagobas or relic shrines,\r\nthirty-eight times; of the chakra, or wheel, the emblem of Dharma--the\r\nlaw--ten times; and of Devi or Sri, the goddess, who afterwards, in the\r\nHindu Pantheon, became the consort of Vishnu, ten times. The trisul or\r\ntrident emblem which crowns the gateways may be, and I am inclined to\r\nbelieve does, represent Buddha himself. On the left-hand pillar of the\r\nnorth gateway it crowns a pillar, hung with wreaths and emblems, at the\r\nbottom of which are the sacred feet (Woodcut No. 34). The whole looking\r\nlike a mystic emblem of a divinity, it was forbidden to represent it\r\nunder a human form. The corresponding face of the opposite pillar is\r\nadorned with architectural scrolls, wholly without any esoteric meaning\r\nso far as can be detected, but of great beauty of design (Woodcut No.\r\n35).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34. Bas-relief on left-hand Pillar, Northern Gateway.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 35. Ornament on right-hand Pillar, Northern Gateway.]\r\n\r\nOther sculptures represent sieges and fighting, and consequent triumphs,\r\nbut, so far as can be seen, for the acquisition of relics or subjects\r\nconnected with the faith. Others portray men and women eating and\r\ndrinking and making love, and otherwise occupied, in a manner as unlike\r\nanything we have hitherto been accustomed to connect with Buddhism as\r\ncan well be imagined. Be this as it may, the sculptures of these\r\ngateways form a perfect picture Bible of Buddhism as it existed in India\r\nin the first century of the Christian Era, and as such are as important\r\nhistorically as they are interesting artistically.[127]\r\n\r\nThe small tope (No. 3), on the same platform as the great tope at\r\nSanchi, was surrounded by a rail, which has now almost entirely\r\ndisappeared. It had, however, one toran, the pillars and one beam of\r\nwhich are still standing. It is only about half the size of those of the\r\ngreat tope, measuring about 17 ft. to the top of the upper beam, and 13\r\nft. across its lower beam. It is apparently somewhat more modern than\r\nthe great gateways, and its sculptures seem to have reference to the\r\nacts of Sariputra and Moggalana, whose relics, as above mentioned, were\r\ndeposited in its womb.\r\n\r\nThis tope was only 40 ft. in diameter, which is about the same dimension\r\nas No. 2 Tope, containing the relics of the ten apostles who took part\r\nin the third convocation under Asoka, and afterwards in the diffusion of\r\nthe Buddhist religion in the countries bordering on India.\r\n\r\nAs above pointed out, the rails at Buddh Gaya and Bharhut afford a\r\nsimilar picture of Buddhism at a time from two to three centuries\r\nearlier. At first sight the difference is not so striking as might be\r\nexpected, but on a closer examination it is only too evident that both\r\nthe art and the morals had degenerated during the interval. There is a\r\nprecision and a sharpness about the Bharhut sculptures which is not\r\nfound here, and drinking and love-making do not occur in the earlier\r\nsculptures--they do, however, occur at Buddh Gaya--to anything like the\r\nextent they do at Sanchi. There is no instance at Bharhut of any figure\r\nentirely nude; at Sanchi nudity among the females is rather the rule\r\nthan the exception. The objects of worship are nearly the same in both\r\ninstances, but are better expressed in the earlier than in the later\r\nexamples. Till, however, the Bharhut sculptures are published in the\r\nsame detail as those of Sanchi, it is hardly fair to insist too strongly\r\non any comparison that may be instituted between them. I believe I know\r\nnearly all, but till the publication of General Cunningham’s work the\r\npublic will not have the same advantage.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these torans, it may be well to draw attention again to\r\nthe fact of their being, even more evidently than the rails, so little\r\nremoved from the wooden originals out of which they were elaborated. No\r\none can look at them, however carelessly, without perceiving that their\r\nforms are such as a carpenter would imagine, and could construct, but\r\nwhich could not be invented by any process of stone or brick masonry\r\nwith which we are familiar. The real wonder is that, when the new\r\nfashion was introduced of repeating in stone what had previously been\r\nexecuted only in wood, any one had the hardihood to attempt such an\r\nerection in stone; and still more wonderful is it that, having been\r\ndone, three of them should have stood during eighteen centuries, till\r\none was knocked down by some clumsy Englishmen, and that only one--the\r\nearliest, and consequently the slightest and most wooden--should have\r\nfallen from natural causes.\r\n\r\nAlthough these Sanchi torans are not the earliest specimens of their\r\nclass executed wholly in stone, neither are they the last. We have, it\r\nis true, no means of knowing whether those represented at Amravati[128]\r\nwere in stone or in wood, but, from their different appearances, some of\r\nthem most probably were in the more permanent material. At all events,\r\nin China and Japan their descendants are counted by thousands. The\r\npailoos in the former country, and the toris in the latter, are copies\r\nmore or less correct of these Sanchi gateways, and like their Indian\r\nprototypes are sometimes in stone, sometimes in wood, and frequently\r\ncompounded of both materials, in varying proportions. What is still more\r\ncurious, a toran with five bars was erected in front of the Temple at\r\nJerusalem, to bear the sacred golden vine, some forty years before these\r\nSanchi examples. It, however, was partly in wood, partly in stone, and\r\nwas erected to replace one that adorned Solomon’s Temple, which was\r\nwholly in bronze, and supported by the celebrated pillars Jachin and\r\nBoaz.[129]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMRAVATI.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rail at Bharhut is the most interesting and important in\r\nIndia in an historical sense, it is far from being equal to that at\r\nAmravati, either in elaboration or in artistic merit. Indeed, in these\r\nrespects, the Amravati rail is probably the most remarkable monument in\r\nIndia. In the first place it is more than twice the dimensions of the\r\nrail at Bharhut, the great rail being 195 ft. in diameter, the inner 165\r\nft., or almost exactly twice the dimensions of that at Bharhut; between\r\nthese two was the procession-path, which in the earlier examples was on\r\nthe tope itself. Externally, the total height of the great rail was\r\nabout 14 ft.; internally, it was 2 ft. less, while the inner rail was\r\nsolid, and only 6 ft. in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 36. External Elevation of Great Rail at Amravati.]\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the great rail may be judged of from the\r\nannexed woodcut (No. 36), representing a small section of it. The lower\r\npart, or plinth, was ornamented by a frieze of animals and boys,\r\ngenerally in ludicrous and comic attitudes. The pillars, as usual, were\r\noctagonal, ornamented with full discs in the centre, and half discs top\r\nand bottom, between which were figure sculptures of more or less\r\nimportance. On the three rails were full discs, all most elaborately\r\ncarved, and all different. Above runs the usual undulating roll\r\nmoulding, which was universal in all ages,[130] but is here richly\r\ninterspersed with figures and emblems. The inside of the rail was very\r\nmuch more richly ornamented than the outside shown in the woodcut; all\r\nthe central range of discs, both on the pillars and on the rails, being\r\ncarved with figured subjects, generally of very great elaboration and\r\nbeauty of detail, and the upper rail was one continuous bas-relief\r\nupwards of 600 ft. in length. At the returns of the gateways another\r\nsystem was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37. Angle pillar at Amravati.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 38. Slab from Inner Rail, Amravati.]\r\n\r\nadopted, as shown in the above woodcut (No. 37). The pillars being\r\nnarrower, and the discs smaller, the principal sculpture was on the\r\nintermediate space: in this instance a king on his throne receives a\r\nmessenger, while his army in front defends the walls; lower down the\r\ninfantry, cavalry, and elephants sally forth in battle array, while one\r\nof the enemy sues for peace, which is probably the information being\r\ncommunicated to the king.\r\n\r\nThe inner rail, though lower, was even more richly ornamented than the\r\ngreat rail, generally with figures of dagobas--apparently twelve in each\r\nquadrant--most elaborately carved with scenes from the life of Buddha or\r\nfrom legends. One of these dagobas has already been given (Woodcut No.\r\n17). Between these were pillars and slabs ornamented, either as shown in\r\nWoodcuts Nos. 38 and 39, or with either Buddhist designs or emblems, but\r\nall as rich, at least, as these; the whole making up a series of\r\npictures of Buddhism, as it was understood in the 4th and 5th centuries,\r\nunsurpassed by anything now known to exist in India. The slab\r\nrepresented in Woodcut No. 38 (p. 101), though now much ruined, is\r\ninteresting as showing the three great objects of Buddhist worship at\r\nonce. At the top is the dagoba with its rail, but with the five-headed\r\nNaga in the place usually occupied by Buddha. In the central compartment\r\nis the chakra or wheel, now generally acknowledged to be the emblem of\r\nDharma, the second member of the Buddhist Trinity; below that the tree,\r\npossibly representing Sanga or the congregation; and in front of all a\r\nthrone, on which is placed what I believe to be a relic, wrapt up in a\r\nsilken cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 39. Dagoba (from a Slab), Amravati.]\r\n\r\nThis combination is repeated again and again in these sculptures, and\r\nmay be almost designated as the shorter Buddhist catechism, or rather\r\nthe confession of faith, Buddha, Dharma, Sanga. The last woodcut (No.\r\n39) is also interesting, as showing, besides the three emblems, the form\r\nof pillars with its double animal capitals so common in structures of\r\nthis and an earlier age.\r\n\r\nThe age of these rails does not seem doubtful.[131] The outer or great\r\nrail seems to have been commenced about A.D. 319, at the time when the\r\ntooth relic paid this place a visit on its way from Puri to Ceylon, and\r\nits erection may have occupied the whole of the rest of that century.\r\nThe inner rail is more modern, and seems to have been begun about A.D.\r\n400, and, with some other detached fragments, carry the history of the\r\nmonument down, it may be, to 500. At the same time it is clear that an\r\nolder monument existed on the spot. The fragments that exist of the\r\ncentral tope are certainly of an earlier age, and some of the slabs of\r\nthe inner rail exhibit sculptures of a much earlier date on their backs.\r\nIt seems as if they had belonged to some disused earlier building, and\r\nbeen re-worked when fitted to their new places.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiouen Thsang visited this place in the year 639 it had already\r\nbeen deserted for more than a century, but he speaks of its magnificence\r\nand the beauty of its site in more glowing terms than he applies to\r\nalmost any other monument in India. Among other expressions he uses one\r\nnot easily understood at first sight, for he says, “It was ornamented\r\nwith all the magnificence of the palaces of Bactria”[132] (Tahia). Now,\r\nhowever, that we know what the native art of India was from the\r\nsculptures at Bharhut and Sanchi, and as we also know nearly what the\r\nart of Bactria was from those recently dug up near Peshawur, especially\r\nat Jamalgiri, we see at once that it was by a marriage of these two arts\r\nthat the Amravati school of sculpture was produced, but with a stronger\r\nclassical influence than anything of its kind found elsewhere in India.\r\nIt is now also tolerably evident that the existence of so splendid a\r\nBuddhist establishment so far south must have been due to the fact of\r\nthe mouths of the Kistnah and Godavery being ports of departure from\r\nwhich the Buddhists of the north-west and west of India, in early times,\r\nconquered or colonised Pegu and Cambodia, and eventually the island of\r\nJava.\r\n\r\nAll this will be clearer as we proceed. Meanwhile it seems probable that\r\nwith this, which is certainly the most splendid specimen of its class,\r\nwe must conclude our history of Buddhist rails. No later example is\r\nknown to exist; and the Gandhara topes, which generally seem to be of\r\nthis age or later, have all their rails attached to their sides in the\r\nshape of a row of pilasters. If they had any figured illustrations, they\r\nmust have been in the form of paintings on plaster on the panels between\r\nthe pilasters. This, indeed, was probably the mode in which they were\r\nadorned, for it certainly was not with sculptures, but we cannot\r\nunderstand any Buddhist monument existing anywhere, without the jatakas\r\nor legends being portrayed on its walls in some shape or other.\r\n\r\nAt Sarnath all reminiscences of a rail had disappeared, and a new mode\r\nof ornamentation introduced, which bore no resemblance to anything found\r\non the earlier topes.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, our history of the rails may finish about A.D. 500,\r\nit by no means follows that many examples may not yet be brought to\r\nlight belonging to the seven and a half centuries that elapsed between\r\nthat date and the age of Asoka. As they all certainly were sculptured to\r\na greater or less extent, when they are examined and published we may\r\nhope to have an ancient pictorial history of India for those ages nearly\r\nas complete as that possessed by any other country in the world. At\r\npresent, however, we only know of ten or twelve examples, but they are\r\nso easily thrown down and buried that we may hope to find many more\r\nwhenever they are looked for, and from them to learn the whole story of\r\nBuddhist art.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The central crowning ornament in Woodcut No. 33, page 96, is\r\n     a chakra or wheel in the centre, with trisul emblems right and\r\n     left. On the upper beam, five dagobas and two trees are worshipped;\r\n     on the intermediate blocks, Sri and a chakra; on the middle beam\r\n     are seven sacred trees, with altars; on the intermediate blocks,\r\n     Sri and the chakra again. The lower beam is wholly occupied by the\r\n     early scenes in the Wessantara jataka, which is continued in the\r\n     rear. The subjects on the pillars have all been described in ‘Tree\r\n     and Serpent Worship,’ but are on too small a scale to be\r\n     distinguishable in the woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 40. Trisul Emblem. (From a sculpture at Amravati.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCHAITYA HALLS.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nBehar Caves--Western Chaitya Halls, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, if looked at from a merely artistic point of view, it will\r\nprobably be found that the rails are the most interesting Buddhist\r\nremains that have come down to our time, still, in an historical or\r\narchitectural sense, they are certainly surpassed by the chaitya halls.\r\nThese are the temples of the religion, properly so called, and the exact\r\ncounterpart of the churches of the Christians, not only in form, but in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nSome twenty or thirty of these are known still to exist in a state of\r\ngreater or less preservation, but, with one exception, all cut in the\r\nrock. In so far as the interior is concerned this is of little or no\r\nconsequence, but it prevents our being able to judge of their external\r\nform or effect,[133] and, what is perhaps worse, it hides from us\r\nentirely the mode in which their roofs were constructed. We know that\r\nthey were formed with semicircular ribs of timber, and it is also nearly\r\ncertain that on these ribs planks in two or three thicknesses were laid,\r\nbut we cannot even guess what covered the planks externally. It could\r\nhardly have been metal, or any kind of felt, and one is unwilling to\r\nbelieve that they were thatched with grass, though I confess, as the\r\nevidence at present stands, this seems to me the most probable\r\nsuggestion.[134]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 41. Plan of Chaitya Hall, Sanchi. Scale 30 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe only structural one is at Sanchi, and is shown in plan in the\r\naccompanying woodcut (No. 41). It does not however, suffice to show us\r\nhow the roofs of the aisles were supported externally. What it does\r\nshow, which the caves do not, is that when the aisle which surrounded\r\nthe apse could be lighted from the exterior, the apse was carried up\r\nsolid. In all the caves the pillars surrounding the dagoba are different\r\nfrom and plainer than those of the nave. They are, in fact, kept as\r\nsubdued as possible, as if it was thought they had no business there,\r\nbut were necessary to admit light into the circumambient aisle of the\r\napse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs almost all our information regarding these chaityas, as well as the\r\nviharas, which form the next group to be described, is derived from the\r\nrock-cut examples in Western India, it would be convenient, if it were\r\npossible, to present something like a statistical account of the number\r\nand distribution of the groups of caves found there. The descriptions\r\nhitherto published do not, however, as yet admit of this.\r\n\r\nI have myself visited and described all the most important of them;[135]\r\nand in an interesting paper, communicated to the Bombay branch of the\r\nAsiatic Society by the Rev. Dr. Wilson, he enumerated thirty-seven\r\ndifferent groups of caves, more or less known to Europeans.[136] This\r\nnumber is exclusive of those in Bengal and Madras, and new ones are\r\ndaily being discovered; we may therefore fairly assume that certainly\r\nmore than forty, and probably nearly fifty, groups of caves exist in\r\nIndia Proper.\r\n\r\nSome of these groups contain as many as 100 different and distinct\r\nexcavations, many not more than ten or a dozen; but altogether I feel\r\nconvinced that not less than 1000 distinct specimens are to be found. Of\r\nthese probably 100 may be of Brahmanical or Jaina origin; the remaining\r\n900 are Buddhist, either monasteries or temples, the former being\r\nincomparably the more numerous class; for of the latter not more than\r\ntwenty or thirty are known to exist. This difference arose, no doubt,\r\nfrom the greater number of the viharas being grouped around structural\r\ntopes, as is always the case in Afghanistan and Ceylon; and,\r\nconsequently, they did not require any rock-cut place of worship while\r\npossessed of the more usual and appropriate edifice.\r\n\r\nThe façades of the caves are generally perfect, and form an exception to\r\nwhat has been said of our ignorance of the external appearance of Indian\r\ntemples and monasteries, since they are executed in the rock with all\r\nthe detail that could have graced the buildings of which they are\r\ncopies. In the investigation of these objects, the perfect immutability\r\nof a temple once hewn out of the living rock is a very important\r\nadvantage. No repair can add to, or indeed scarcely alter, the general\r\nfeatures of what is once so executed; and there can be no doubt that we\r\nsee them now, in all essentials, exactly as originally designed. This\r\nadvantage will be easily appreciated by any one who has tried to grope\r\nfor the evidence of a date in the design, afforded by our much-altered\r\nand often reconstructed cathedrals of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the caves is somewhat singular, more\r\nthan nine-tenths of those now known being found within the limits of the\r\nBombay Presidency. The remainder consist of two groups in Bengal; those\r\nof Behar and Cuttack, neither of which is important in extent; one only\r\nis known to exist in Madras, that of Mahavellipore; and two or three\r\ninsignificant groups, which have been traced in Afghanistan and the\r\nPunjab.\r\n\r\nAt one time some were inclined to connect this remarkable local\r\ndistribution with the comparative proximity of the west side of India to\r\nthe rock-cutting Egyptians and Ethiopians. But the coincidence can be\r\nmore simply accounted for by the existence in both countries of rocks\r\nperfectly adapted to such works. The great cave district of western\r\nIndia is composed of horizontal strata of amygdaloid and other cognate\r\ntrap formations, generally speaking of very considerable thickness and\r\ngreat uniformity of texture, and possessing besides the advantage that\r\ntheir edges are generally exposed in perfectly perpendicular cliffs. No\r\nrock in any part of the world could either be more suited for the\r\npurpose or more favourably situated than these formations. They were\r\neasily accessible and easily worked. In the rarest possible instances\r\nare there any flaws or faults to disturb the uniformity of the design;\r\nand, when complete, they afford a perfectly dry temple or abode,\r\nsingularly uniform in temperature, and more durable than any class of\r\ntemple found in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Asoka, who, two hundred and fifty years before Christ,\r\nexcavated the first cave at Rajagriha, till the great cataclysm in the\r\n8th century, the series is uninterrupted; and, if properly examined and\r\ndrawn, the caves would furnish us with a complete religious and artistic\r\nhistory of the greater part of India during ten or eleven centuries, the\r\ndarkest and most perplexing of her existence. But, although during this\r\nlong period the practice was common to Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains, it\r\nceased before the Mahomedan conquest. Hardly any excavations have been\r\nmade or attempted since that period, except, perhaps, some rude Jaina\r\nmonoliths in the rock at Gualior, and it may be one or two in southern\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEHAR CAVES.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from what we know of the history of the localities,\r\nthe oldest caves in India are situated in Behar, in the neighbourhood of\r\nRajagriha, which was the capital of Bengal at the time of the advent of\r\nBuddha. There is, indeed, one cave there which claims to be the\r\nSatapanni cave, in front of which the first convocation was held B.C.\r\n543. It is, however, only a natural cave very slightly improved by art,\r\nand of no architectural importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 42. Nigope Cave, Sat Ghurba group.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting group is situated at a place called Barabar,\r\nsixteen miles north of Gaya. One there, called the Karna Chopar, bears\r\nan inscription which records the excavation of the cave in the\r\nnineteenth year of Asoka (B.C. 245).[137] It is very simple, and, except\r\nin a doorway with sloping jambs, has no architectural feature of\r\nimportance. A second, called the Sudama or Nigope cave (Woodcut No. 42),\r\nbears an inscription by Asoka in the twelfth year of his reign, the same\r\nyear in which most of his edicts are dated, 260 or 264 B.C., and,\r\nconsequently, is the oldest architectural example in India. It consists\r\nof two apartments: an outer, 32 ft. 9 in. in length, and 19 ft. 6 in. in\r\nbreadth, and beyond this a circular apartment, 19 ft. in diameter, in\r\nthe place usually occupied by the solid dagoba;[138] in front of which\r\nthe roof hangs down and projects in a manner very much as if it were\r\nintended to represent thatch. The most interesting of the group is that\r\ncalled Lomas Rishi, which, though bearing no contemporary inscription,\r\ncertainly belongs to the same age. The frontispiece is singularly\r\ninteresting as representing in the rock the form of the structural\r\nchaityas of the age. These, as will be seen from the woodcut (No. 43),\r\nwere apparently constructed with strong wooden posts, sloping slightly\r\ninwards, supporting a longitudinal rafter morticed into their heads,\r\nwhile three small blocks on each side are employed to keep the roof in\r\nform. Between the pillars was a framework of wood, which served to\r\nsupport five smaller rafters. Over these lies the roof, apparently\r\nformed of three thicknesses of plank, or probably two of timber planks\r\nlaid reverse ways, and one of metal or some other substance externally.\r\nThe form of the roof is something of a pointed arch, with a slight ogee\r\npoint on the summit to form a watershed. The door, like all those of\r\nthis series, has sloping jambs[139]--a peculiarity arising, as we shall\r\nafterwards see, from the lines of the openings following, as in this\r\ninstance, those of the supports of the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 43. Façade of Lomas Rishi Cave. (From a Photograph by Mr.\r\nPeppe, C.E.)]\r\n\r\nThe interior, as will be seen from the annexed plan (No. 44), is quite\r\nplain in form, and does not seem to have been ever quite completed. It\r\nconsists of a hall 33 ft. by 19 ft., beyond which is an apartment of\r\nnearly circular form, evidently meant to represent a tope or dagoba, but\r\nat that early age the architects had not quite found out how to\r\naccomplish this in a rock-cut structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 44. Lomas Rishi Cave.]\r\n\r\nJudging from the inscriptions on these caves, the whole were excavated\r\nbetween the date of the Nigope and that of the Milkmaid’s Cave, so\r\ncalled (which was excavated by Dasaratha, the grandson of Asoka),\r\nprobably within fifty years of that date. They appear to range,\r\ntherefore, from 260 to 200 B.C., and the Lomas Rishi is probably the\r\nmost modern[140]--it certainly is the most richly ornamented. No great\r\namount of elaboration, however, is found in these examples, inasmuch as\r\nthe material in which they are excavated is the hardest and most\r\nclose-grained granite; and it was hardly to be expected that a people\r\nwho so recently had been using nothing but wood as a building material\r\nwould have patience sufficient for labours like these. They have\r\npolished them like glass in the interior, and with that they have been\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN CHAITYA HALLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 45. Chaitya Cave, Bhaja. (From a Plan by Mr. Burgess.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThere are in the Western Ghâts in the Bombay Presidency five or six\r\nimportant chaitya caves whose dates can be made out, either from\r\ninscriptions, or from internal evidence, with very fair approximate\r\ncertainty, and all of which were excavated, if I am not very much\r\nmistaken, before the Christian Era. The oldest of these is situated at a\r\nplace called Bhaja, four miles south of the great Karli cave in the\r\nBhore Ghât. There is no inscription upon it, but I have a plan and\r\nseveral photographs. From the woodcut (No. 45), it will be perceived\r\nthat it is a chaitya hall of the usual plan, but of no great dimensions,\r\nbeing only 60 ft. from the back of the apse to the mortices (_a_ _a_),\r\nin which the supports of the wooden screen once stood. From the woodcut\r\n(No. 46), taken from one of these photographs, it will be perceived that\r\nthe pillars of the interior slope inwards at a considerable and most\r\nunpleasing angle. The rood-screen which closes the front of all other\r\ncaves of this class is gone. In all other examples it is in stone, and\r\nconsequently remains; but in this instance, being in wood, it has\r\ndisappeared, though the holes to receive its posts and the mortices by\r\nwhich it was attached to the walls are still there. The ogee fronton was\r\ncovered with wooden ornaments, which have disappeared; though the\r\npin-holes remain by which they were fastened to the stone. The\r\nframework, or truss that filled the upper part of the great front\r\nopening, no longer exists, but what its appearance was may be judged of\r\nby the numerous representations of itself with which it is covered, or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 46. Façade of the Cave at Bhaja. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 47. Front of a Chaitya Hall. (From a Bas-relief at Buddh\r\nGaya.)]\r\n\r\nfrom the representation of a chaitya façade from the contemporary rail\r\nat Buddh Gaya (Woodcut No. 47), and there are several others on the rail\r\nat Bharhut, which are not only correct elevations of such a façade as\r\nthis, but represent the wooden carved ornaments which--according to that\r\nauthority--invariably adorned these façades. The only existing example\r\nof this wooden screen is that at Karli, but the innumerable small\r\nrepetitions of it, not only here but in all these caves, shows not only\r\nits form, but how universal its employment was. The rafters of the roof\r\nwere of wood, and many of them, as may be seen in the woodcut, remain to\r\nthe present day. Everything, in fact, that could be made in wood\r\nremained in wood, and only the constructive parts necessary for\r\nstability were executed in the rock.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that, the first time men undertook to repeat in\r\nstone forms they had only been accustomed to erect in wood, they should\r\nhave done so literally. The sloping inwards of the pillars was requisite\r\nto resist the thrust of the circular roof in the wooden building, but it\r\nmust have appeared so awkward in stone that it would hardly be often\r\nrepeated. As, however, it was probably almost universal in structural\r\nbuildings, the doorways and openings naturally followed the same lines,\r\nhence the sloping jambs. Though these were by no means so objectionable\r\nin practice, they varied with the lines of the supports, and, as these\r\nbecame upright, the jambs became parallel. In like manner, when it was\r\ndone, the architects could hardly fail to perceive that they had wasted\r\nboth time and labour in cutting away the rock to make way for their\r\nwooden screen in front. Had they left it standing, with far less expense\r\nthey could have got a more ornamental and more durable feature. This was\r\nso self-evident that it never, so far as is known, was repeated, but it\r\nwas some time before the pillars of the interior got quite\r\nperpendicular, and the jambs of the doors quite parallel.\r\n\r\nThere is very little figure-sculpture about this cave; none in the\r\ninterior, and what there is on the façade seems to be of a very domestic\r\ncharacter. But on the pillars in the interior at _g_ and _h_ in the plan\r\n(Woodcut No. 45), we find two emblems, and at _a_, _e_, and _f_ three\r\nothers are found somewhat rudely formed, but which occur again so\r\nfrequently that it may be worth while to quote them here. They are known\r\nas the trisul, or trident, the central point being usually more\r\nimportant than here shown, the shield, and the chakra, or wheel. The two\r\nfirst are generally found in combination, as in Woodcut No. 33, and the\r\nwheel is frequently found edged with trisul ornaments, as in the central\r\ncompartment of Woodcut No. 38 from Amravati. The fourth emblem here is\r\nthe trisul, in combination with a face, and the fifth is one which is\r\nfrequently repeated on coins and elsewhere, but to which no name has yet\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 48. Trisul. Shield. Chakra. Trisul.]\r\n\r\nThe next group of caves, however, that at Bedsa, ten or eleven miles\r\nsouth of Karli, shows considerable progress towards lithic construction.\r\nThe screen is in stone; the pillars are more upright,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 49. Plan of Cave at Bedsa. (From a Plan by Mr. Burgess.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 50. Capital of Pillar in front of Cave at Bedsa. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nthough still sloping slightly inwards, the jambs more nearly parallel,\r\nand in fact we have nearly all the features of a well-designed chaitya\r\ncave. The two pillars in front, however, as will be seen from the plan\r\n(Woodcut No. 49), are so much too large in proportion to the rest, that\r\nthey are evidently stambhas, and ought to stand free instead of\r\nsupporting a verandah. Their capitals (Woodcut No. 50, p. 113) are more\r\nlike the Persepolitan than any others in India, and are each surmounted\r\nby horses and elephants bearing men\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 51. View on Verandah of Cave at Bedsa. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nand women of bold and free execution. From the view (Woodcut No. 51) it\r\nwill be seen how much the surface is covered with the rail decoration, a\r\nrepetition on a small scale of the rails described in the last section,\r\nand which it may here be mentioned is a fair test of the age of any\r\nbuilding. It gradually becomes less and less used after the date\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 52. Chaitya Cave at Nassick. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nof these two chaitya caves, and disappears wholly in the 4th or 5th\r\ncenturies, but during that period its greater or less prevalence in any\r\nbuilding is one of the surest indications we have of the relative age of\r\nany two examples. In this cave, as will be observed, nearly the whole of\r\nthe ornamentation is made up of miniature rails, and repetitions of\r\nwindow fronts or façades. It has also a semicircular open-work moulding,\r\nlike basket-work, which is only found in the very oldest caves, and is\r\nevidently so unsuited for stone-work that it is no wonder it was dropped\r\nvery early. No example of it is known after the Christian Era. There is\r\nan inscription in this cave in an ancient form of letter, but not\r\nsufficiently distinct to fix its age absolutely without further\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe third cave is the chaitya at Nassick. Its pillars internally are so\r\nnearly perpendicular that their inclination might escape detection, and\r\nthe door jambs are nearly parallel.\r\n\r\nThe façade, as seen in the woodcut (No. 52, p. 115), is a very perfect\r\nand complete design, but all its details are copied from wooden forms,\r\nand nothing was executed in wood in this cave but the rafters of the\r\nroofs internally, and these have fallen down.\r\n\r\nOutside this cave, over the doorway, there is an inscription, stating\r\nthat the cave was the gift of a citizen of Nassick,[141] in the reign of\r\nKing Krishna, the second of the Andrabritya kings, who reigned just\r\nbefore the Christian Era,[142] and inside, on the pillars, another in an\r\nolder form of character, stating that it was excavated in honour of King\r\nBadrakaraka,[143] who was almost certainly the fifth king of the Sunga\r\ndynasty, and who ascended the throne about B.C. 129. It may be possible\r\nthat a more critical examination of these inscriptions may render their\r\ntestimony less absolute than it now appears, but, taking them in\r\nconjunction with the architecture, the age of this cave hardly seems\r\ndoubtful. For myself, I see no reason for hesitating to accept B.C. 129\r\nas the date of its inception, though its completion may be a century\r\nlater, and, if this is so, it carries back the caves of Bhaja and Bedsa\r\nto a period considerably before that time, while, on the other hand, it\r\nas certainly is older than the Karli cave, which appears to come next to\r\nit in age.\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLI.\r\n\r\nThe fourth cave mentioned above, known as that at Karli, is situated on\r\nthe road between Bombay and Poonah, and is the finest of all--the\r\nfinest, indeed, of its class. It is certainly the largest as well as the\r\nmost complete chaitya cave hitherto discovered in India, and was\r\nexcavated at a time when the style was in its greatest purity. In it all\r\nthe architectural defects of the previous examples are removed; the\r\npillars of the nave are quite perpendicular. The screen is ornamented\r\nwith sculpture--its first appearance apparently in such a position--and\r\nthe style had reached a perfection that was never afterwards surpassed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 53. Section of Cave at Karli. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 54. Plan of Cave at Karli.]\r\n\r\nIn this cave there is an inscription on the side of the porch, and\r\nanother on the lion-pillar in front, which are certainly integral, and\r\nascribe its excavation to the Maharaja Bhuti or Deva Bhuti,[144] who,\r\naccording to the Puranas, reigned B.C. 78, and, if this is so, they fix\r\nthe age of this typical example beyond all cavil.\r\n\r\nThe building, as will be seen by the annexed illustrations (Nos. 53, 54,\r\n55), resembles, to a very great extent, an early Christian church in its\r\narrangements: consisting of a nave and side-aisles, terminating in an\r\napse or semidome, round which the aisle is carried. The general\r\ndimensions of the interior are 126 ft. from the entrance to the back\r\nwall, by 45 ft. 7 in. in width. The side-aisles, however, are very much\r\nnarrower than in Christian churches, the central one being 25 ft. 7 in.,\r\nso that the others are only 10 ft. wide, including the thickness of the\r\npillars. As a scale for comparison, it may be mentioned that its\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 55. View of Cave at Karli. (From a Drawing by Mr. Salt,\r\ncorrected by the Author.)]\r\n\r\narrangement and dimensions are very similar to those of the choir of\r\nNorwich Cathedral, or of the Abbaye aux Hommes at Caen, omitting the\r\nouter aisles in the latter buildings. The thickness of the piers at\r\nNorwich and Caen nearly corresponds to the breadth of the aisles in the\r\nIndian temple. In height, however, Karli is very inferior, being only 42\r\nft. or perhaps 45 ft. from the floor to the apex, as nearly as can be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nFifteen pillars on each side separate the nave from the aisles; each\r\npillar has a tall base, an octagonal shaft, and richly ornamented\r\ncapital, on which kneel two elephants, each bearing two figures,\r\ngenerally a man and a woman, but sometimes two females, all very much\r\nbetter executed than such ornaments usually are. The seven pillars\r\nbehind the altar are plain octagonal piers, without either base or\r\ncapital, and the four under the entrance gallery differ considerably\r\nfrom those at the sides. The sculptures on the capitals supply the place\r\nusually occupied by frieze and cornice in Grecian architecture; and in\r\nother examples plain painted surfaces occupy the same space. Above this\r\nsprings the roof, semicircular in general section, but somewhat stilted\r\nat the sides, so as to make its height greater than the semi-diameter.\r\nIt is ornamented even at this day by a series of wooden ribs, probably\r\ncoeval with the excavation, which prove beyond the shadow of a doubt\r\nthat the roof is not a copy of a masonry arch, but of some sort of\r\ntimber construction which we cannot now very well understand.\r\n\r\nImmediately under the semidome of the apse, and nearly where the altar\r\nstands in Christian churches, is placed the dagoba, in this instance a\r\nplain dome slightly stilted on a circular drum. As there are no\r\nornaments on it now, and no mortices for woodwork, it probably was\r\noriginally plastered and painted, or may have been adorned with\r\nhangings, which some of the sculptured representations would lead us to\r\nsuppose was the usual mode of ornamenting these altars. It is surmounted\r\nby a Tee, the base of which is similar to the one shown on Woodcut No.\r\n13, and on this still stand the remains of an umbrella in wood, very\r\nmuch decayed and distorted by age.\r\n\r\nOpposite this is the entrance, consisting of three doorways, under a\r\ngallery exactly corresponding with our roodloft, one leading to the\r\ncentre, and one to each of the side-aisles; and over the gallery the\r\nwhole end of the hall is open as in all these chaitya halls, forming one\r\ngreat window, through which all the light is admitted. This great window\r\nis formed in the shape of a horseshoe, and exactly resembles those used\r\nas ornaments on the façade of this cave, as well as on those of Bhaja,\r\nBedsa, and at Nassick described above, and which are met with everywhere\r\nat this age. Within the arch is a framework or centering of wood\r\nstanding free (Woodcut No. 55). This, so far as we can judge, is, like\r\nthe ribs of the interior, coeval with the building;[145] at all events,\r\nif it has been renewed, it is an exact copy of the original form, for it\r\nis found repeated in stone in all the niches of the façade, over the\r\ndoorways, and generally as an ornament everywhere, and with the Buddhist\r\n“rail,” copied from Sanchi, forms the most usual ornament of the style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 56. View of Interior of Cave at Karli. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the woodwork is an additional proof, if any were wanted,\r\nthat there were no arches of construction in any of these Buddhist\r\nbuildings. There neither were nor are any in any Indian building\r\nanterior to the Mahomedan Conquest, and very few indeed in any Hindu\r\nbuilding afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to Karli, the outer porch is considerably wider\r\nthan the body of the building, being 52 ft. wide, and is closed in front\r\nby a screen composed of two stout octagonal pillars, without either base\r\nor capital, supporting what is now a plain mass of rock, but which was\r\nonce ornamented by a wooden gallery forming the principal ornament of\r\nthe façade. Above this a dwarf colonnade or attic of four columns\r\nbetween pilasters admitted light to the great window, and this again was\r\nsurmounted by a wooden cornice or ornament of some sort, though we\r\ncannot now restore it, since only the mortices remain that attached it\r\nto the rock.\r\n\r\nIn advance of this screen stands the lion-pillar, in this instance a\r\nplain shaft with thirty-two flutes, or rather faces, surmounted by a\r\ncapital not unlike that at Kesariah (Woodcut No. 6), but at Karli\r\nsupporting four lions instead of one, and, for reasons given above (p.\r\n55), they seem almost certainly to have supported a chakra or Buddhist\r\nwheel. A similar pillar probably stood on the opposite side, but it has\r\neither fallen or been taken down to make way for the little temple that\r\nnow occupies its place.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the wooden ornaments of the external porch, as well as\r\nour ignorance of the mode in which this temple was finished laterally,\r\nand the porch joined to the main temple, prevents us from judging what\r\nthe effect of the front would have been if belonging to a free-standing\r\nbuilding. But the proportions of such parts as remain are so good, and\r\nthe effect of the whole so pleasing, that there can be little hesitation\r\nin ascribing to such a design a tolerably high rank among architectural\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nOf the interior we can judge perfectly, and it certainly is as solemn\r\nand grand as any interior can well be, and the mode of lighting the most\r\nperfect--one undivided volume of light coming through a single opening\r\noverhead at a very favourable angle, and falling directly on the altar\r\nor principal object in the building, leaving the rest in comparative\r\nobscurity. The effect is considerably heightened by the closely set\r\nthick columns that divide the three aisles from one another, as they\r\nsuffice to prevent the boundary walls from ever being seen, and, as\r\nthere are no openings in the walls, the view between the pillars is\r\npractically unlimited.\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities are found more or less developed in all the other\r\ncaves of the same class in India, varying only with the age and the\r\ngradual change that took place from the more purely wooden forms of\r\nthese caves to the lithic or stone architecture of the more modern ones.\r\nThis is the principal test by which their relative ages can be\r\ndetermined, and it proves incontestably that the Karli cave was\r\nexcavated not very long after stone came to be used as a\r\nbuilding-material in India.\r\n\r\nThere are caves at Ajunta and probably at Junir which are as old as the\r\nfour just described, and, when the history of cave architecture comes\r\nto be written _in extenso_, will supply details that are wanting in the\r\nexamples just quoted. Meanwhile, however, their forms are sufficient to\r\nplace the history on a firm basis, and to explain the origin and early\r\nprogress of the style with sufficient distinctness.\r\n\r\nFrom the inscriptions and literary evidence, it seems hardly doubtful\r\nthat the date of the Karli cave is about 78 B.C., and that at Nassick\r\nabout 129 B.C. We have no literary authority for the date of the two\r\nearlier ones, but the archæological evidence appears irresistible. The\r\nBhaja cave is so absolutely identical in style with the Lomas Rishi cave\r\nat Behar (Woodcut No. 43) that they must be of very nearly the same age.\r\nTheir pillars and their doorways slope so nearly at the same angle, and\r\nthe essential woodenness--if the expression may be used--of both is so\r\nexactly the same, that, the one being of the age of Asoka, the other\r\ncannot be far removed from the date of his reign. The Bedsa cave\r\nexhibits a degree of progress so nearly halfway between the Bhaja and\r\nNassick examples, that it may safely be dated 150 to 200 B.C., and the\r\nwhole four thus exhibit the progress of the style during nearly two\r\ncenturies in the most satisfactory manner, and form a basis from which\r\nwe may proceed to reason with very little hesitation or doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAJUNTA.[146]\r\n\r\nThere are four chaitya caves in the Ajunta series which, though not so\r\nmagnificent as some of the four just mentioned, are nearly as important\r\nfor the purposes of our history. The oldest there (No. 9) is the lowest\r\ndown on the cliff, and is of the smallest class, being only 45 ft. by 23\r\nft. in width. All its woodwork has perished, though it would not be\r\ndifficult to restore it from the mortices left and the representations\r\nof itself on the façade. There are several inscriptions, but they do not\r\nseem integral. They are painted on the walls, and belong, from the form\r\nof their characters, to the 2nd or 3rd century of our era, when the\r\nfrescoes seem to have been renewed, so that the real tests of its age\r\nare, first, its position in the series, which make it, with its\r\naccompanying vihara (No. 12), undoubtedly the oldest there; the other\r\ntest is the architecture of its façade, which so much resembles that of\r\nthe Nassick chaitya (B.C. 129) that it cannot be far off in date. It\r\nmay, however, be somewhat earlier, as the pillars in the interior slope\r\ninwards at a somewhat greater angle, and, in so far as that is a test of\r\nage, it indicates a greater antiquity in the Ajunta example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 57. Interior of Chaitya Cave No. 10 at Ajunta. (From a\r\nSketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThe next chaitya (No. 10) is situated very near to the last, a little\r\nhigher up in the rock, however, and of nearly twice its dimensions. It\r\nis 94 ft. 6 in. in depth by 41 ft. 3 in. in width internally. As may be\r\nseen from the annexed view (Woodcut No. 57), the nave is separated from\r\nthe aisles by a range of plain octagonal shafts, perfectly upright, but\r\nwithout capitals or bases. The triforium belt is of unusual height, and\r\nwas originally plastered and painted. Traces of this can still be seen,\r\nthough the design cannot be made out (Woodcut No. 58). One of the most\r\nremarkable characteristics of the cave is that it shows signs of\r\ntransition from wood to stone in its architectural details. The ribs of\r\nthe aisle are in stone cut in rock, but copied from the wooden forms of\r\nprevious examples. The vault of the nave was adorned with wooden ribs,\r\nthe mortices for which are still there, and their marks can still be\r\ntraced in the roof, but the wood itself is gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 58. Cross-Section of Cave No. 10 at Ajunta. No scale.]\r\n\r\nThere are two inscriptions in this cave which seem to be integral, but\r\nunfortunately neither of them contain names that can be identified; but\r\nfrom the form of their characters a palæographist would almost\r\ncertainly place them anterior to the Christian Era.[147] Taking,\r\nhowever, all the circumstances of the case into consideration, and so as\r\nto avoid stretching any point too far, it would, perhaps, be better to\r\nassume for the present that the cave belongs to the 1st century of our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nThe façades of both these caves are so much ruined by the rock falling\r\naway that it is impossible to assert that there was no sculpture on the\r\nlower parts. None, certainly, exists in the interior, where everything\r\ndepends on painting; and it is, to say the least of it, very improbable\r\nthat any figure-sculpture ever adorned the oldest, while it seems likely\r\nthat even No. 10 depended wholly on conventional architectural forms for\r\nits adornment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 59. Chaitya No. 19 at Ajunta. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe next chaitya cave in this series (No. 19) is separated from these\r\ntwo by a very long interval of time. Unfortunately, no inscription\r\nexists upon it which would assist in assigning it any precise date; but\r\nit belongs to a group of viharas, Nos. 16 and 17, whose date, as we\r\nshall afterwards see, can be fixed with tolerable certainty as belonging\r\nto the 5th century of our era. The cave itself, as will be seen from the\r\nplan (Woodcut No. 59), is of the smallest size, nearly the same as No.\r\n9, or 46 ft. 4 in. by 23 ft. 7 in., and its arrangements do not differ\r\nmuch, but its details belong to a totally different school of art. All\r\ntrace of woodwork has disappeared, but wooden forms are everywhere\r\nrepeated in stone, like the triglyphs and mutules of the Doric order,\r\nlong after their original meaning was lost. More than this, painting in\r\nthe interval had to a great extent become disused as a means of\r\ndecoration, both internally and externally, and sculpture substituted\r\nfor it in all monumental works; but the greatest change of all is that\r\nBuddha, in all his attitudes, is introduced everywhere. In the next\r\nwoodcut (No. 60)--the view of the façade--it will be seen how completely\r\nfigure-sculpture had superseded the plainer architectural forms of the\r\nearlier caves. The rail ornament, too, has entirely disappeared; the\r\nwindow heads have been dwarfed down to mere framings for masks; but,\r\nwhat is even more significant than these, is that from a pure theism or\r\nrather atheism we have passed to an overwhelming idolatry. At Karli, the\r\neight figures that originally adorned the porch are chiefs with their\r\nwives, in pairs. All the figures of Buddha that appear there now are\r\nlong subsequent additions. None but mortals were sculptured in the\r\nearlier caves, and among these mortals Sakya Muni nowhere appears. Here,\r\non the contrary, he is Bhagavat--the Holy One--the Deity--the object of\r\nworship, and occupies a position in the front of the dagoba or altar\r\nitself (Woodcut No. 61, p. 126), surmounted by the triple umbrella and\r\nas the Numen of the place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60. View of Façade, Chaitya Cave No. 19 at Ajunta. (From\r\na Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAt a future stage of our inquiries we may be able to fix more nearly the\r\ntime in which this portentous change took place in Buddhist ritual. For\r\nthe present it is sufficient to remark that images of Buddha, and their\r\nworship, were not known in India in the 1st century of our era, and that\r\nthe revolution was complete in the 5th century.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this cave, however, it may be well to remark on the\r\nchange that had taken place in the form of the dagoba during these 500\r\nyears. If Woodcut No. 61 is compared with the dagobas in Nos. 56 and 57,\r\nit will be seen how much the low rounded form of the early examples had\r\nbeen conventionalised into a tall steeple-like object. The drum had\r\nbecome more important than the dome, and was ornamented with\r\narchitectural features that have no meaning as applied. But more curious\r\nstill is the form the triple umbrella had assumed. It had now become a\r\nsteeple reaching to the roof of the cave, and its original form and\r\nmeaning would hardly be suspected by those who were not familiar with\r\nthe intermediate steps.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of more than three umbrellas being found surmounting any\r\ndagoba in the caves, but the annexed representation of a model of one\r\nfound at Sultanpore, near Jelalabad (Woodcut No. 62), probably of about\r\nthe same age, has six such discs; and in Behar numerous models are found\r\nwith seven, making with the base and finial nine storeys,[148] which\r\nafterwards in China became the conventional number for the nine-storeyed\r\ntowers of that land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 61. Rock-cut Dagoba at Ajunta. (From a Drawing by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 62. Small Model found in the Tope at Sultanpore. (From\r\nWilson’s ‘Ariana Antiqua.’)]\r\n\r\nThe last chaitya at Ajunta (No. 26) is of a medium size, 66 ft. by 36,\r\nand has a long inscription, but which unfortunately contains nothing to\r\nenable us to fix its date with certainty. It is certainly more modern\r\nthan the last-named, its sculptures are coarser, and their meaning more\r\nmythological. We shall probably not err in assuming that it was\r\nexcavated towards the end of the 6th or beginning of the 7th century;\r\nand that the year 600 is not far from its true date. Its chief interest\r\nis in showing how nearly Buddhism was approximating to Brahmanism when\r\nthe catastrophe took place which expelled the former from the country of\r\nits birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nELLORA.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Viswakarma cave at Ellora is a chaitya of the first\r\nclass, intermediate in age between the two last-described caves at\r\nAjunta, or it may be as modern as the last. There are unfortunately no\r\ninscriptions nor any traditions[149] that would assist in fixing its\r\nage, which must consequently depend wholly on its position in the series\r\nand its architectural peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of this cave are considerable, 85 ft. by 43 ft., and the\r\ninner end is entirely blocked up by the dagoba which, instead of being\r\ncircular as in all the older examples, has a frontispiece attached to it\r\nlarger than that in cave No. 19 at Ajunta, which, as shown in Woodcut\r\nNo. 60, makes it square in front. On this addition is a figure of Buddha\r\nseated with his feet down, and surrounded by attendants and flying\r\nfigures in the latest style of Buddhist art. In the roof, all the ribs\r\nand ornaments are cut in the rock, though still copied from wooden\r\nprototypes, and the triforium has sculptured figures as in Nos. 19 and\r\n26 of Ajunta. Its most marked characteristic, however, is the façade,\r\nwhere for the first time we miss the great horseshoe opening, which is\r\nthe most marked feature in all previous examples. We can still trace a\r\nreminiscence of it in the upper part of the window in the centre\r\n(Woodcut No. 63, p. 128); but it was evidently considered necessary, in\r\nthis instance, to reduce the size of the opening, and it is easy to see\r\nwhy this was the case. At Bedsa, Karli, Kenheri and elsewhere, there was\r\na verandah or porch with a screen in front of the great window, which\r\nprevented the direct rays of the sun from reaching it, and all the older\r\ncaves had wooden screens, as at Karli, from which curtains could be hung\r\nso as to modify the light to any desired extent. At Ellora, no screen\r\ncould ever have existed in front, and wooden additions had long ceased\r\nto be used, so that it consequently became necessary to reduce the size\r\nof the opening. In the two later chaityas at Ajunta, this is effected by\r\nsimply reducing their size. At Ellora it was done by dividing it. If we\r\nhad the structural examples in which this change was probably first\r\nintroduced, we might trace its progress; but, as this one is the only\r\nexample we have of a divided window, we must accept it as one of the\r\nlatest modifications of the façades of these chaityas. Practically, it\r\nmay be an improvement, as it is still sufficiently large to light the\r\ninterior in a satisfactory manner; but artistically it seems rather to\r\nbe regretted. There is a character and a grandeur about the older design\r\nwhich we miss in this more domestic-looking arrangement, though it is\r\nstill a form of opening not destitute of beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 63. Façade of the Viswakarma Cave at Ellora. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nOwing to the sloping nature of the ground in which it is excavated this\r\ncave possesses a forecourt of considerable extent and of great elegance\r\nof design, which gives its façade an importance it is not entitled to\r\nfrom any intrinsic merit of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENHERI.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known and most frequently described chaityas in India is\r\nthat on the island of Salsette, in Bombay Harbour, known as the great\r\nKenheri cave. In dimensions it belongs to the first rank, being 88 ft. 6\r\nin. by 39 ft. 10 in., and it has the advantage that its date is now\r\nalmost absolutely fixed. In the verandah there is an inscription\r\nrecording that the celebrated Buddhaghosha dedicated one of the\r\nmiddle-sized statues in the porch to the honour of the lord\r\nBhagawan,[150] and in the same porch another inscription records the\r\nexecution of the great statues of Buddha by “Gotamiputra’s imperial\r\ndescendant Sri Yadnya Sat Karni.”[151] Now we know that the first-named,\r\nBuddhaghosha, went on his mission to Ceylon, B.C. 410,[152] and he is\r\nnot known ever to have returned to India; and Yadnya Sri has always been\r\nassumed to have lived 408-428, generally it must be confessed on the\r\nmistaken etymology of confounding his name with that of Yuegai of the\r\nChinese. That, however, is apparently only a translation of the “Moon\r\nbeloved king,” and more applicable, consequently, to Chandra Sri or\r\nChandragupta, who was his contemporary. The true basis for the\r\ndetermination of his date is the Puranic chronology, which, for this\r\nperiod seems indisputable.[153] Be all this as it may, the conjunction\r\nof these two names here in this cave settles their date, and settles\r\nalso the age of the cave as belonging to the early years of the 5th\r\ncentury, at the time when Fa Hian was travelling in India.\r\n\r\nThis being so, one would naturally expect that the architecture of the\r\ncave should exhibit some stage of progress intermediate between cave No.\r\n10 and cave No. 19 of Ajunta, but nothing of the sort is apparent here;\r\nthe Kenheri cave is a literal copy of the great cave at Karli, but in so\r\ninferior a style of art that, when I first saw it, I was inclined to\r\nascribe it to an age of Buddhist decrepitude, when the traditions of\r\ntrue art had passed away, and men were trying by spasmodic efforts to\r\nrevive a dead art. This being now proved not to be the case, the\r\narchitecture of this cave can only be looked upon as an exceptional\r\nanomaly, the principles of whose design are unlike anything else to be\r\nfound in India, emanating probably from some individual caprice, the\r\norigin of which we may probably never now be able to recover.\r\n\r\nInternally the roof was ornamented with timber rafters, and though these\r\nhave fallen away, the wooden pins by which they were fastened to the\r\nrock still remain; and the screen in front has all the mortices and\r\nother indications, as at Karli, proving that it was intended to be\r\ncovered with wooden galleries and framework. What is still more curious,\r\nthe figures of chiefs with their wives, which adorn the front of the\r\nscreen at Karli, are here repeated literally, but copied so badly as not\r\nat first sight to be easily recognisable. This is the more strange as it\r\noccurred at an age when their place was reserved for figures of Buddha,\r\nand when, at Karli itself, they were cutting away the old sculptures and\r\nold inscriptions, to introduce figures of Buddha, either seated\r\ncross-legged, or borne on the lotus, supported by Naga figures at its\r\nbase.[154]\r\n\r\nIn front of this cave is a dwarf rail which, with the knowledge we now\r\nhave, would in itself be almost sufficient to settle the age, in spite\r\nof these anomalies (Woodcut No. 64). Unfortunately it is so weather-worn\r\nthat it is difficult to make out all its details; but comparing it with\r\nthe Gautamiputra rail (Woodcut No. 32) and the Amravati rail (Woodcut\r\nNo. 36), it will be seen that it contains all those complications that\r\nwere introduced in the 3rd and 4th centuries, but which were\r\ndiscontinued in the 5th and 6th, when the rail in any shape fell into\r\ndisuse as an architectural ornament.[155]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 64. Rail in front of Great Cave, Kenheri. (From a Drawing\r\nby Mr. West.)]\r\n\r\nThe evidence in fact seems complete that this cave was excavated in the\r\nearly years of the 5th century; but, admitting this, it remains an\r\nanomaly, the like of which only occurs once again so far as I know in\r\nthe history of Indian architecture, and that in a vihara at Nassick of\r\nthe same age, to be described hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDHUMNAR.\r\n\r\nAbout half way between Kotah and Ujjain, in Rajputana, there exists a\r\nseries of caves at a place called Dhumnar which are of considerable\r\nextent, but the interest that might be felt in them is considerably\r\ndiminished by their being cut in a coarse laterite conglomerate, so\r\ncoarse that all the finer architectural details had to be worked out in\r\nplaster, and that, having perished with time, only their plans and\r\noutlines can now be recognised. Among the sixty or seventy excavations\r\nhere found one is a chaitya of some extent, and presenting peculiarities\r\nof plan not found elsewhere. It is practically a chaitya cella situated\r\nin the midst of a vihara (Woodcut No. 65). The cell in which the dagoba\r\nis situated is only 35 ft. by 13 ft. 6 in., but to this must be added\r\nthe porch, or ante-chapel, extending 25 ft. further, making the whole 60\r\nft. On two sides, and on half the third, it is surrounded by an open\r\nverandah leading to the cells. The third side never was finished, but in\r\ntwo of the side cells are smaller dagobas--the whole making a confused\r\nmass of chambers and chaityas in which all the original parts are\r\nconfounded, and all the primitive simplicity of design and arrangement\r\nis lost, to such an extent that, without previous knowledge, they would\r\nhardly be recognisable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 65. Cave at Dhumnar. (From a Plan by Gen. Cunningham.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThere are no exact dates for determining the age of this cave, but like\r\nall of the series it is late, probably between the years 500 and 600\r\nA.D., or even later, and its great interest is that, on comparing it\r\nwith the chaitya and vihara at Bhaja or Bedsa (Woodcuts Nos. 46 and 49),\r\nwe are enabled to realise the progress and changes that took place in\r\ndesigning these monuments during the seven or eight centuries that\r\nelapsed between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nKHOLVI.\r\n\r\nNot far from Dhumnar is another series of caves not so extensive, but\r\ninteresting as being probably the most modern group of Buddhist caves in\r\nIndia. No very complete account of them has yet been published,[156] but\r\nenough is known to enable us to feel sure how modern they are. One,\r\ncalled Arjun’s House, is a highly ornamented dagoba, originally\r\napparently some 20 ft. in height, but the upper part being in masonry\r\nhas fallen away. Inside this is a cell open to the front, in which is a\r\ncross-legged seated figure of Buddha, showing an approach to the Hindu\r\nmode of treating images in their temples, which looks as if Buddhism was\r\non the verge of disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe same arrangement is repeated in the only excavation here which can\r\nbe called a chaitya hall. It is only 26 ft. by 13 ft. internally; but\r\nthe whole of the dagoba, which is 8 ft. in diameter, has been hollowed\r\nout to make a cell, in which an image of Buddha is enshrined. The\r\ndagobas, in fact, here--there are three standing by themselves--have\r\nbecome temples, and only distinguishable from those of the Hindus by\r\ntheir circular forms.[157]\r\n\r\nIt is probably hardly necessary to say more on this subject now, as most\r\nof the questions, both of art and chronology, will be again touched upon\r\nin the next chapter when describing the viharas which were attached to\r\nthe chaityas, and were, in fact, parts of the same establishments. As\r\nmere residences, the viharas may be deficient in that dignity and unity\r\nwhich characterises the chaityas, but their number and variety make up\r\nto a great extent for their other deficiencies; and altogether their\r\ndescription forms one of the most interesting chapters in our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nVIHARAS,[158] OR MONASTERIES.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nStructural Viharas--Bengal and Western Vihara Caves--Nassick, Ajunta,\r\nBagh, Dhumnar, Kholvi, and Ellora Viharas--Circular Cave at Junir.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL VIHARAS.\r\n\r\nWe are almost more dependent on rock-cut examples for our knowledge of\r\nthe Viharas or monasteries of the Buddhists than we are for that of\r\ntheir Chaityas or churches: a circumstance more to be regretted in this\r\ninstance than in the other. In a chaitya hall the interior is naturally\r\nthe principal object, and where the art of the architect would be\r\nprincipally lavished. Next would come the façade. The sides and apse are\r\ncomparatively insignificant and incapable of ornament. The façades and\r\nthe interior can be as well expressed in the rock as when standing free;\r\nbut the case is different with the viharas. A court or hall surrounded\r\nwith cells is not an imposing architectural object. Where the court has\r\ngalleries two or three storeys in height, and the pillars that support\r\nthese are richly carved, it may attain an amount of picturesqueness we\r\nfind in our old hostelries, or of that class of beauty that prevails in\r\nthe courts of Spanish monasteries.[159] Such was, I believe, the form\r\nmany of the Indian structural viharas may have taken, but which could\r\nhardly be repeated in the rock; and, unless some representations are\r\ndiscovered among the paintings or sculptures, we shall probably never\r\nknow, though we may guess, what the original appearances may have been.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 66. Great Rath at Mahavellipore. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 67. Diagram Explanatory of the Arrangement of a Buddhist\r\nVihara of Four Storeys in Height.]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, I believe, another form of Vihara even less capable\r\nof being repeated in the rock. It was pyramidal, and is the original of\r\nall the temples of southern India. Take, for instance, a description of\r\none mentioned both by Fa Hian and Hiouen Thsang,[160] though neither of\r\nthem, it must be confessed, ever saw it, which accounts in part for some\r\nabsurdities in the description:--“The building,” says Fa Hian, “has\r\naltogether five storeys. The lowest is shaped into the form of an\r\nelephant, and has 500 stone cells in it; the second is in the form of a\r\nlion, and has 400 chambers; the third is shaped like a horse, and has\r\n300 chambers; the fourth is in the form of an ox, and has 200 chambers;\r\nand the fifth is in the shape of a dove, and has 100 chambers in\r\nit”--and the account given of it by Hiouen Thsang is practically the\r\nsame.[161] At first sight this looks wild enough; but if we substitute\r\nthe assertion that the several storeys were adorned with elephants,\r\nlions, horses, &c., we get a mode of decoration which began at Karli,\r\nwhere a great range of elephants adorn the lower storey, and was\r\ncontinued with variations to Hullabîd, where, as we shall see further\r\non, all these five animals are, in the 13th century, superimposed upon\r\none another exactly as here recounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n68.      69.\r\n\r\nSquare and oblong Cells from a Bas-relief at Bharhut.]\r\n\r\nThe opposite woodcut (No. 66), taken from one of the raths at\r\nMahavellipore, probably correctly represents such a structure, and I\r\nbelieve also the form of a great many ancient viharas in India. The\r\ndiagram (No. 67) is intended to explain what probably were the internal\r\narrangements of such a structure. As far as it can be understood from\r\nthe rock-cut examples we have, the centre was occupied by halls of\r\nvarying dimensions according to height, supported by wooden posts above\r\nthe ground-floor, and used as the common day-rooms of the monks. The\r\nsleeping-cells (Woodcuts Nos. 68, 69) were apparently on the terraces,\r\nand may have been such as are frequently represented in the bas-reliefs\r\nat Bharhut and elsewhere. Alternately they seem to have been square and\r\noblong, and with smaller apartments between. Of course we must not take\r\ntoo literally a representation of a monastery, carried out solidly in\r\nthe rock for a different purpose, as an absolutely correct\r\nrepresentation of its original. The importance, however, of this form,\r\nas explaining the peculiarities of subsequent Buddhist and Dravidian\r\narchitecture, is so great that it is well worth quoting here, though\r\nthis will be more evident in the sequel than it can be at present. In\r\nconstruction the breadth, in a structural building, would probably have\r\nbeen greater in proportion to the height than in this example, but that\r\nis of little consequence for our present purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, always difficult, sometimes impossible, to realise the\r\nform of buildings from verbal descriptions only, and the Chinese\r\nPilgrims were not adepts at architectural definitions. Still Hiouen\r\nThsang’s description of the great Nalanda monastery is important, and so\r\ngermane to our present subject that it cannot well be passed over.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated monastery, which was the Monte Cassino of India for the\r\nfirst five centuries of our era, was situated thirty-four miles south of\r\nPatna, and seven miles north of the old capital of Rajagriha. If not\r\nfounded under the auspices of the celebrated Nagárjuna in the 1st\r\ncentury, he at all events resided there, introducing the Mahayana or\r\ngreat translation, and making it the seat of that school for Central\r\nIndia. After his time six successive kings had built as many viharas on\r\nthis spot, when one of them surrounded the whole with a high wall, which\r\ncan still be traced, measuring 1600 ft. north and south, by 400 ft., and\r\nenclosing eight separate courts. Externally to this enclosure were\r\nnumerous stupas or tower-like viharas, ten or twelve of which are easily\r\nrecognised, and have been identified, with more or less certainty, by\r\nGeneral Cunningham, from the Pilgrim’s description.[162] The general\r\nappearance of the place may be gathered from the following:--“In the\r\ndifferent courts the houses of the monks were each four storeys in\r\nheight. The pavilions had pillars ornamented with dragons, and had beams\r\nresplendent with all the colours of the rainbow--rafters richly\r\ncarved--columns ornamented with jade, painted red and richly chiselled,\r\nand balustrades of carved open work. The lintels of the doors were\r\ndecorated with elegance, and the roofs covered with glazed tiles of\r\nbrilliant colours, which multiplied themselves by reflection, and varied\r\nthe effect at every moment in a thousand manners.” Or as he\r\nenthusiastically sums up:--“The Sangharamas of India are counted by\r\nthousands, but there are none equal to this in majesty or richness, or\r\nthe height of their construction.”[163]\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of the effects of Burmese monasteries at the present\r\nday this is probably no exaggeration; and with its groves of\r\nMango-trees, and its immense tanks, which still remain, it must have\r\nbeen, as he says, “an enchanting abode.” Here there resided in his\r\ntime--within and without the walls--10,000 priests and neophytes, and\r\nreligion and philosophy were taught from a hundred chairs, and here\r\nconsequently our Pilgrim sojourned for five years, imbibing the\r\ndoctrines of the Law of Buddha. What Cluny and Clairvaux were to France\r\nin the Middle Ages, Nalanda was to Central India, the depository of all\r\ntrue learning, and the foundation from which it spread over all the\r\nother lands of the faithful; but still, as in all instances connected\r\nwith that strange parallelism which existed between the two religions,\r\nthe Buddhists kept five centuries in advance of the Christians in the\r\ninvention and use of all the ceremonies and forms common to both\r\nreligions.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be satisfactory if the architecture of this celebrated\r\nmonastery could be restored and its arrangements made clear. Something\r\nhas been done by Cunningham[164] towards this, and excavations have been\r\nmade by Mr. Broadley and Captain Marshall. The former it is feared has\r\ndestroyed more than he has restored, and his drawings are so imperfect\r\nas to be utterly unintelligible. The latter has not yet published his\r\ndiscoveries. Nothing, however, would probably better repay a systematic\r\nexploration than this celebrated spot, if undertaken by some one\r\naccustomed to such researches, and capable of making detailed\r\narchitectural drawings of what is found.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it should turn out, as hinted above, that the whole of the\r\nsuperstructure of these viharas was in wood, either fire or natural\r\ndecay may have made such havoc among all that remains of them, as to\r\nleave little to reward the labours of the explorer. What has been done\r\nin this direction certainly affords no great encouragement to hope for\r\nmuch. At Sultangunge, near Monghyr, a large vihara was cut through by\r\nthe railway, but except one remarkable bronze statue of Buddha[165]\r\nnothing was found of importance. The monastery apparently consisted of\r\ntwo large courtyards surrounded by cells. What was found, however, could\r\nonly have been the foundations, as there were no doorways to the\r\napartments or means of communication between each other or with the\r\nexterior.[166]\r\n\r\nThe vihara excavated by Captain Kittoe and Mr. Thomas, at Sarnath, seems\r\ncertainly to have been destroyed by fire. All that remained was a series\r\nof some twenty cells and four larger halls surrounding a pillared court\r\n50 ft. square. On one side were three cells evidently forming a\r\nsanctuary, as is frequently found in the later rock-cut examples.[167]\r\n\r\nThe excavations conducted by General Cunningham, at the same place, are\r\nhardly more satisfactory in their result. The two buildings he explored\r\nseem to bear the relation to one another of a vihara 60 ft. square over\r\nall, and a temple of little more than half these dimensions with a\r\nprojecting porch on each face.[168] Only the foundation of these\r\nbuildings now remains, and nothing to indicate how they were originally\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nWe may eventually hit on some representation which may enable us to form\r\ndefinite ideas on this subject, but till we do this we probably must be\r\ncontent with the interiors as seen in the rock-cut examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENGAL CAVES.\r\n\r\nNone of the Behar caves can, properly speaking, be called viharas, in\r\nthe sense in which the word is generally used, except perhaps the Son\r\nBhandar, which, as before mentioned, General Cunningham identifies with\r\nthe Sattapanni cave, in front of which the first convocation was held\r\n543 B.C. It is a plain rectangular excavation, 33 ft. 9 in. long by 17\r\nft. wide, and 11 ft. 7 in. to the springing of the curved roof.[169] It\r\nhas one door and one window, but both, like the rest of the cave,\r\nwithout mouldings or any architectural features that would assist in\r\ndetermining its age. The jambs of the doorway slope slightly inwards,\r\nbut not sufficiently to give an idea of great antiquity. In front there\r\nwas a wooden verandah, the mortice holes for which are still visible in\r\nthe front wall.\r\n\r\nThe other caves, at Barabar and Nagárjuna, if not exactly chaityas in\r\nthe sense in which that term is applied to the western caves, were at\r\nleast oratories, places of prayer and worship, rather than residences.\r\nOne Arhat or ascetic may have resided in them, but for the purpose of\r\nperforming the necessary services. There are no separate cells in them,\r\nnor any division that can be considered as separating the ceremonial\r\nfrom the domestic uses of the cave, and they must consequently, for the\r\npresent at least, be classed as chaityas rather than viharas.\r\n\r\nThe case is widely different when we turn to the caves in Orissa, which\r\nare among the most interesting, though at the same time the most\r\nanomalous, of all the caves in India. They are situated in two isolated\r\nhills of sandstone rock, about twenty miles from Cuttack and five from\r\nBhuvaneswar. The oldest are in the hill called Udayagiri; the more\r\nmodern in that portion designated Khandagiri. They became Jaina about\r\nthe 10th or 11th century, and the last-named hill is crowned by a Jaina\r\ntemple, erected by the Maharattas in the end of the last century.\r\n\r\nWhat we know of the age of the older caves is principally derived from a\r\nlong inscription on the front of the oldest, known as the Hathi Gumpha,\r\nor Elephant Cave.[170] From it we learn that it was engraved by a king\r\ncalled Aira, who ascended the throne of Kalinga in his twenty-fourth\r\nyear, and spread his power by conquest over neighbouring rajas. He seems\r\nat first to have vacillated between the Brahmanical and Buddhist faiths,\r\nbut finally to have adopted the latter and distributed infinite alms.\r\nAmong other good works, he is said “to have constructed subterranean\r\nchambers--caves containing a chaitya temple, and pillars.”\r\n\r\nPalæographically, the forms of the letters used in this inscription are\r\nidentical with those used by Asoka in the copy of his edicts on the\r\nAswatama rock close by, and that recently found at Aska, near the\r\nnorthern corner of the Chilkya lake. The first presumption, therefore,\r\nis that they may be of about the same date. This is justified by the\r\nmention of Nanda in the past tense, while there seems no reason for\r\ndoubting that he was one of the kings of that name who immediately\r\npreceded the revolution that placed Chandragupta on the throne. Beside\r\nthese, there are other indications in this inscription which seem to\r\nmake it almost certain that Aira was contemporary with the great Mauryan\r\ndynasty of Magadha; but whether he preceded or followed Asoka is not\r\nquite so clear. Still it appears unlikely that Asoka would have been\r\nallowed to set up two copies of his edicts in the dominions of such\r\npowerful kings as Aira and his father seem to have been, and as unlikely\r\nthat Aira should make such a record without some allusion to the\r\npreviously promulgated edicts, had they then existed. On the whole, I am\r\ninclined to believe that Aira lived before Asoka, and, if so, that this\r\nis the oldest inscription yet found in India. Be this as it may, the\r\ncave in which it is found is certainly the oldest here. It is a great\r\nnatural cavern, the brow of which has been smoothed to admit of this\r\ninscription, but all the rest remains nearly in a state of nature. Close\r\nto it is a small cave, the whole “fronton” of which over the doorway is\r\noccupied by a great three-headed Naga, and may be as old as the Hathi\r\ncave. The inscription on it merely says that it is the unequalled\r\nchamber of Chulakarma, who seems also to have excavated another cave,\r\nhere called the Pawan Gabha,[171] or Purification Cave.\r\n\r\nBesides these, and smaller caves to be noticed hereafter, the great\r\ninterest of the Udayagiri caves centres in two--the so-called Ganesa\r\ncave, and that called the Raj Rani, or Rani Hanspur, from a\r\ntradition--Hindu--that it was excavated by the Rani of Lelat Indra\r\nKesari, the celebrated builder of the Bhuvaneswar temple in the 7th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 70. Ganesa Cave. (From a Plan by Mr. Locke.) Scale 50 ft.\r\nto 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe former is a small cave, consisting of two cells, together 30 ft.\r\nlong by 10 ft. wide, in front of which is a verandah, slightly longer,\r\nthat was once adorned with five pillars, though only three are now\r\nstanding (Woodcut No. 70). There is an inscription on this cave in the\r\nKutila characters, dedicating it to Jaganath; but this is evidently an\r\naddition in modern times.[172] The style of the architecture may be\r\njudged of from the annexed woodcut, representing one of its pillars\r\n(Woodcut No. 71). They are of extreme simplicity, being square piers,\r\nchanging into octagons in the centre only, and with a slight bracket of\r\nvery wooden construction on each face. The doorways leading into the\r\ncells are adorned with the usual horseshoe formed canopies copied from\r\nthe fronts of the chaitya halls, and which we are now so familiar with\r\nfrom the Bharhut sculptures, and from the openings common to all wooden\r\nbuildings of that age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 71. Pillar in Ganesa Cave, Cuttack. (From a Sketch by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 72. Upper Storey, Rani Gumpha. (From a Plan by H. H.\r\nLocke.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe other cave is very much larger, being two storeys in height, both of\r\nwhich were originally adorned by verandahs: the upper 62 ft. long,\r\nopening into four cells (Woodcut No. 72), the lower, 44 ft., opening\r\ninto three. All the doors leading into these cells have jambs sloping\r\nslightly inwards, which is itself a sufficient indication that the cave\r\nis anterior to the Christian Era, it may be, by a century or\r\nthereabouts. Of the nine pillars of the upper verandah only two remain\r\nstanding, and these much mutilated, while all the six of the lower\r\nstorey have perished. It seems as if from inexperience the excavators\r\nhad not left sufficient substance to support the mass of rock above; and\r\nprobably, in consequence of some slight shocks of an earthquake, the\r\nmass above fell in, bearing everything before it. Either then, or at\r\nsome subsequent period, an attempt has been made to restore the lower\r\nverandah in wood, and for this purpose a chase has been cut through the\r\nsculptures that adorned its back wall, and they have been otherwise so\r\nmutilated that it is almost impossible to make out their meaning.\r\nFortunately, those of the upper verandahs are tolerably entire, though\r\nin some parts they, too, have been very badly treated.\r\n\r\nBesides this, which may be called the main body of the building, two\r\nwings project forward; that on the left 40 ft., that on the right 20\r\nft.; and, as these contained cells on both storeys, the whole afforded\r\naccommodation for a considerable number of inmates.\r\n\r\nThe great interest of these two caves, however, lies in their\r\nsculptures. In the Ganesa cave there are two bas-reliefs. The first\r\nrepresents a man asleep under a tree, and a woman watching over him. To\r\nthem a woman is approaching leading a man by the hand, as if to\r\nintroduce him to the sleeper. Beyond them a man and a woman are fighting\r\nwith swords and shields in very close combat, and behind them a man is\r\ncarrying off a naked female in his arms.[173]\r\n\r\nThe second bas-relief comprises fifteen figures and two elephants. There\r\nmay be in it two successive scenes, though my impression is, that only\r\none is intended, while I feel certain this is the case regarding the\r\nfirst. In the Raj Rani cave the second bas-relief is identical, in all\r\nessential respects, with the first in the Ganesa, but the reliefs that\r\nprecede and follow it represent different scenes altogether. It is,\r\nperhaps, in vain to speculate what episode this rape scene represents,\r\nprobably some local tradition not known elsewhere; its greatest interest\r\nfor our present purposes is that the first named is singularly classical\r\nin design and execution, the latter wilder, and both in action and\r\ncostume far more purely Indian. Before the discovery of the Bharhut\r\nsculptures, it is hardly doubtful that we would have pronounced those in\r\nthe Ganesa cave the oldest, as being the most perfect. The Bharhut\r\nsculptures, however, having shown us how perfect the native art was at a\r\nvery early date, have considerably modified our opinions on this\r\nsubject; and those in the Rani cave, being so essentially Indian in\r\ntheir style, now appear to me the oldest. Those in the Ganesa Gumpha, as\r\nmore classical, may have been executed by some Yavana artist at a\r\nsubsequent age, but still both seem anterior to the Christian Era.[174]\r\nThe other bas-reliefs in the Raj Rani cave represent scenes of hunting,\r\nfighting, dancing, drinking, and love-making--anything, in fact, but\r\nreligion or praying in any shape or form. From the sculptures at Sanchi\r\nand Bharhut, we were prepared to expect that we should not find any\r\ndirect evidence of Buddhism in any sculptures anterior to the first\r\ncentury of the Christian Era; but those at this place go beyond these in\r\nthat respect. Nothing here can be interpreted as referring to any scenes\r\nin the life of Sakya Muni, or to any known jataka, and it is by no means\r\nclear whether we shall ever discover the legends to which they refer.\r\nBesides these bassi-relievi, there is in the Rani cave a figure, in high\r\nrelief, of a female (?) riding on a lion. Behind him or her, a soldier\r\nin a kilt, or rather the dress of a Roman soldier, with laced boots\r\nreaching to the calf of the leg--very similar, in fact, to those\r\nrepresented Plate 28, fig. 1, of ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ as\r\nstrangers paying their addresses to the three-storeyed dagoba--and\r\nbehind this, again, a female of very foreign aspect.\r\n\r\nIn another cave of the same group, called the Jodev Garbha, and of about\r\nthe same age, between the two doorways leading to the cell, a sacred\r\ntree is being worshipped. It is surrounded by the usual rail, and\r\ndevotees and others are bringing offerings.[175]\r\n\r\nIn another, probably older than either of the two last-mentioned, called\r\nAnanta Garbha, are two bassi-relievi over the two doorways: one is\r\ndevoted, like the last, to Tree worship, the other to the honour of Sri\r\n(_vide ante_, p. 51). She is standing on her lotus, and two elephants,\r\nstanding likewise on lotuses, are pouring water over her.[176] The same\r\nrepresentation occurs once, at least, at Bharhut, and ten times at\r\nSanchi, and, so far as I know, is the earliest instance of honour paid\r\nto god or man in Indian sculptures.\r\n\r\nOne other cave deserves to be mentioned before leaving Udayagiri. It is\r\na great boulder, carved into the semblance of a tiger’s head, with his\r\njaws open, and his throat, as it should be, is a doorway leading to a\r\nsingle cell (Woodcut No. 73). It is a caprice, but one that shows that\r\nthose who conceived it had some experience in the plastic arts before\r\nthey undertook it. From the form of the characters which are engraved\r\nupon it, it is undoubtedly anterior to the Christian Era, but how much\r\nearlier it is difficult to say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 73. Tiger Cave, Cuttack.]\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view they are looked at, these Orissan caves are\r\nso unlike anything that we have previously been in the habit of\r\nconsidering Buddhist, that it may well be asked whether we are justified\r\nin ascribing their excavation to the followers of that religion at all.\r\nNot only is there no figure of Buddha, in the conventional forms and\r\nattitudes by which he was afterwards recognised, but there is no scene\r\nwhich can be interpreted as representing any event in his life, nor any\r\nof the jatakas in which his future greatness was prefigured. There is no\r\ndagoba in the caves[177] or represented in the sculptures, no chaitya\r\ncave, no wheel emblem, nor anything in fact that is usually considered\r\nemblematical of that religion.\r\n\r\nWhen we look a little more closely into it, however, we do detect the\r\nSwastica and shield emblem attached to the Aira inscription, and the\r\nshield and trisul ornament over the doorways in the older caves, and\r\nthese we know, from what we find at Bharhut and Sanchi, and at Bhaja\r\n(_ante_, p. 112), were considered as Buddhist emblems in these places.\r\nBut were they exclusively so? The trisul ornament is found on the coins\r\nof Kadphises, in conjunction with the bull and trident of Siva,[178] and\r\nwe have no reason for assuming that the Swastica, and it may be even the\r\nshield, were not used by other and earlier sects.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter appears to be that hitherto our knowledge of\r\nBuddhism has been derived almost exclusively from books, which took\r\ntheir present form only in the fourth or fifth century of our era, or\r\nfrom monuments erected after the corruptions of the Mahayana introduced\r\nby Nagárjuna, and those who assisted at the fourth convocation held by\r\nKanishka in the first century of our era. We now are able to realise\r\nfrom the sculptures of Bharhut, of these caves, and of the Sanchi\r\ngateways, and the older western caves, what Buddhism really was between\r\nthe ages of Asoka and Kanishka, and it is a widely different thing from\r\nanything written in the books we possess, or represented afterwards in\r\nsculptures or paintings. Whether we shall ever recover any traces of\r\nwhat Buddhism was between the death of Sakya Muni and Asoka, is more\r\nthan doubtful. If found, it would probably be even more unlike the\r\npresent Buddhism than that of the intermediate period. Judging from what\r\nwe have hitherto found, it looks as if it would turn out to be a pure\r\nworship of trees by a Naga or serpent-reverencing race, on whose\r\nprimitive faith Asoka engrafted the teachings of Sakya Muni. There were\r\nBuddhists, of course, in India before Asoka’s time, but it seems\r\ndoubtful if they were sufficiently powerful to dig caves or erect\r\nmonuments. None at least have yet been discovered, and till they are we\r\nmust be content to stop our backward researches with such a group of\r\nmonuments as these Udayagiri caves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN VIHARA CAVES.\r\n\r\nThere are at least four Viharas which we know for certainty were\r\nexcavated before the Christian Era. There are probably forty, but they\r\nhave not yet been edited with such care as to enable us to feel\r\nconfident in affixing dates to them. The four that are known are those\r\nattached to the chaityas at Bhaja and Bedsa (Woodcuts Nos. 45, 49), and\r\nthe two oldest at Ajunta, Nos. 12 and 11. Those at Karli are probably\r\ncoeval with the great chaitya itself, but, strange to say, they have\r\nnever been drawn or investigated, so that we really know little or\r\nnothing about them. At Junir there are several, which are very old, and\r\nat Sana and Tulaja, in Gujerat, there are several of very ancient date,\r\nbut they, like those at Junir, are too imperfectly known to be quoted as\r\nauthenticated examples of the period.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these is that attached to the chaitya at Bhaja (_ante_,\r\nWoodcut No. 45). It is five-celled; three of these have single stone\r\nbeds in them, one is double-bedded, and one, apparently the residence of\r\nthe superior, is without that uncomfortable piece of furniture. In front\r\nof these are two long stone benches at either end of a hall 33 ft. in\r\nlength. It is not clear whether this hall was always open as at present,\r\nbut, if it was closed, it was by a wooden screen like the chaitya beside\r\nit, which is undoubtedly of the same age. They are indeed parts of one\r\ndesign. The same may be said of the Bedsa vihara, though placed a little\r\nfurther apart. In this case, however, there are three cells with stone\r\nbeds in the verandah of the chaitya, and a fourth was commenced when\r\napparently it was determined to remove the residence a little further\r\noff, and no instance, I believe, occurs afterwards in which they were so\r\nconjoined, till at least a very late date, when, as at Dhumnar (Woodcut\r\nNo. 65), all the parts got again confounded together. As will be seen\r\nfrom the plan (Woodcut No. 49) it is exceptional in form, being apsidal\r\nlike the chaitya itself. It is not clear whether this is a copy of any\r\nexisting wooden erection, or whether it was that, being the first\r\nattempt at an independent vihara in the rock, they thought it ought to\r\nresemble a chaitya in plan. My impression is that the latter is the true\r\nexplanation; such an arrangement in a free-standing structure intended\r\nfor a residence would be absurd, but we are here assisting at the\r\n“incunabula” of the style, and must not be surprised at anomalies.\r\n\r\nNumber 12 at Ajunta is merely a square hall, measuring 36 ft. 7 in. each\r\nway. It has no pillars, and its only ornament consists of seven\r\nhorseshoe arches, four of which are over the doors of cells, the other\r\nthree only ornamental. Unfortunately, the rock over its front has given\r\nway, and carried with it the façade, which probably was the most\r\nornamental part of the design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 74. Cave No. 11, at Ajunta. (From a Plan by the Author.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nNumber 11 is a step in advance of this one, there being four pillars in\r\nits centre (Woodcut No. 74). It has nine cells, but is without any\r\nsanctuary or ritual arrangement. In age, it seems to be contemporary\r\nwith the chaitya No. 10, to which it evidently belongs, and like it may\r\nbe considered as a transitional example, dating about the Christian Era,\r\nor rather before that time.\r\n\r\nThe most marked characteristic of these early viharas on the western\r\nside of India, is that unlike their eastern contemporaries, they are\r\nwholly devoid of figure-sculpture: no bassi-relievi, not even an emblem,\r\nrelieves the severity of their simplicity. Over the doorways of the\r\ncells there are the usual horseshoe arches, copied from the windows of\r\nthe great chaityas, and the invariable Buddhist rail repeated everywhere\r\nas a stringcourse, with an occasional pillar or pilaster to relieve the\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\nThere do not at present seem to exist any data sufficient to account\r\nsatisfactorily for this curious difference between the exuberance of\r\nfigure-sculpture in the east, and its total absence in the west in the\r\npre-Christian Era caves, and the problem must be relegated for further\r\ninquiries. Looking, however, at the progress made of late years in these\r\nsubjects, there is little doubt that its solution is not far off, and\r\nwill, when reached, throw fresh light on the early history of Buddhism.\r\nMeanwhile, it may be worthy of remark, that the only living\r\nrepresentation that is common to both sides of India, is the presence of\r\nthe three-headed Naga on the façade of the Nassick chaitya (Woodcut No.\r\n52), and its appearance in a similar position on the Chulakarma and\r\nAnanta caves at Udayagiri in Orissa. It points to an important feature\r\nin early Buddhist history, but not exactly what we are now looking for.\r\nBesides this the three, five, or seven-headed Naga occurs so frequently\r\nat Bharhut, Sanchi and elsewhere, that his presence here can hardly be\r\ncalled a distinctive peculiarity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 75. Cave No. 2, at Ajunta. (From a Plan by the Author.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe next step after the introduction of four pillars to support the\r\nroof, as in cave No. 11 at Ajunta (Woodcut No. 74), was to introduce\r\ntwelve pillars to support the roof, there being no intermediate number\r\nwhich would divide by four, and admit of an opening in the centre of\r\nevery side. This arrangement is shown in the woodcut (No. 75),\r\nrepresenting the plan of the cave No. 2 at Ajunta. Before this stage of\r\ncave architecture had been reached, the worship had degenerated\r\nconsiderably from its original purity; and these caves always possess a\r\nsanctuary containing an image of Buddha. There are frequently, besides\r\nthis, as in the instance under consideration, two side chapels, like\r\nthose in Catholic churches, containing images of subordinate saints,\r\nsometimes male, sometimes female.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 76. Cave at Bagh. (From a Plan, by Captain Dangerfield,\r\nin the ‘Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society.’) Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nThe next and most extensive arrangement of these square monastery-caves\r\nis that in which twenty pillars are placed in the floor, so as to\r\nsupport the roof, six on each side, counting the corner pillars twice.\r\nThere are several of these large caves at Ajunta and elsewhere; and one\r\nat Bagh, on the Tapty, represented in the last woodcut (No. 76), has,\r\nbesides the ordinary complement, four additional pillars in the centre;\r\nthese were introduced evidently in consequence of the rock not being\r\nsufficiently homogeneous and perfect to support itself without this\r\nadditional precaution.\r\n\r\nThese--which might be classed, according to the terms used in Greek\r\narchitecture, as astyle, when having no pillars; distyle, when with two\r\npillars in each face; tetrastyle, with four; and hexastyle with\r\nsix--form the leading and most characteristic division of these\r\nexcavations, and with slight modification are to be found in all the\r\nmodern series.\r\n\r\nThe forms, however, of many are so various and so abnormal, that it\r\nwould require a far more extended classification to enable us to\r\ndescribe and include them all. In many instances the great depth of the\r\ncave which this square arrangement required was felt to be inconvenient;\r\nand a more oblong form was adopted, as in the Durbar cave at Salsette\r\n(Woodcut No. 77), where, besides, the sanctuary is projected forward,\r\nand assists, with the pillars, to support the roof. In some examples\r\nthis is carried even further, and the sanctuary, standing boldly forward\r\nto the centre of the hall, forms in reality the only support. This,\r\nhowever, is a late arrangement, and must be considered more as an\r\neconomical than an architectural improvement. Indeed by it the dignity\r\nand beauty of the whole composition are almost entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 77. Durbar Cave, Salsette. (From a Plan by the Author.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNASSICK VIHARAS.\r\n\r\nThe two most interesting series of caves for the investigation of the\r\nhistory of the later developments of the Vihara system, are those at\r\nNassick and Ajunta. The latter is by far the most extensive, consisting\r\nof twenty-six first-class caves, four of which are chaityas. The latter\r\ngroup numbers, it is true, seventeen excavations, but only six or seven\r\nof these can be called first-class, and it possesses only one chaitya.\r\nThe others are small excavations of no particular merit or interest.\r\nAjunta has also the advantage of retaining the greater portion of the\r\npaintings which once adorned the walls of all viharas erected\r\nsubsequently to the Christian Era, while these have almost entirely\r\ndisappeared at Nassick, though there seems very little doubt that the\r\nwalls of all the greater viharas there were once so ornamented. This\r\nindeed was one of the great distinctions between them and the earlier\r\nprimitive cells of the monks before the Christian Era. The Buddhist\r\nchurch between Asoka and Kanishka was in the same position as that of\r\nChristianity between Constantine and Gregory the Great. It was the\r\nlast-named pontiff who inaugurated the Middle Ages with all their pomp\r\nand ceremonial. It might, therefore, under certain circumstances be\r\nexpedient to describe the Ajunta viharas first; but they are singularly\r\ndeficient in well-preserved inscriptions containing recognisable names.\r\nNassick, on the other hand, is peculiarly rich in this respect, and the\r\nhistory of the series can be made out with very tolerable approximative\r\ncertainty.[179]\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty is at the beginning of the series. If the chaitya\r\ncave was, as above stated, commenced 129 years before Christ, there\r\nought to have been a vihara of the same age attached to it, but such\r\ndoes not seem to exist. There is indeed a small vihara close to it, and\r\non a lower level than those now on each side of it, and consequently\r\nmore likely to be what we are looking for, than they are. It is a simple\r\nsquare hall measuring 14 ft. each way, with two square cells in three of\r\nits sides, the fourth opening on a verandah with two octagon pillars in\r\nfront. The only ornament of the interior is a horseshoe arch over each\r\nopening, connected with a simple Buddhist rail. In every detail it is in\r\nfact identical with the two old viharas Nos. 12 and 11 Ajunta, and\r\ncertainly anterior to the Christian Era; but it bears an inscription of\r\nKrishna Raja, and he seems almost certainly to be the second of the\r\nAndrabritya race, and he ascended the throne B.C. 8, or 120 years after\r\nthe time we are looking for.[180] But for this the architectural\r\ndetails would accord perfectly with those of the chaitya, and the age\r\nascribed to it; but the inscriptions may have been added afterwards. If\r\nthis is not so, the only suggestion that occurs to me is that, as\r\noriginally executed, the chaitya had a forecourt, and that the cells\r\nwere in this, as at Bedsa and Sana, but that having fallen away, from\r\nsome flaw in the rock, was entirely removed, and at a subsequent time\r\nthat on the right was added at a height of 6 ft. above the level of the\r\nfloor of the chaitya, that on the left at 12 ft., about the same\r\ndatum,[181] which could hardly have been the case if they were part of\r\nthe original conception.\r\n\r\nTurning from these, which practically belong to the last chapter rather\r\nthan to this, the interest is centred in three great viharas, the oldest\r\nof which bears the name of Nahapana (Woodcut No. 78), the second that of\r\nGautamiputra, and the third that of Yadnya Sri--if my chronology is\r\ncorrect, their dates are thus fixed, in round numbers, as A.D. 100, 300,\r\nand 400.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 78. Nahapana Vihara, Nassick. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe two principal viharas at Nassick, Nos. 3 and 8, are so similar in\r\ndimensions and in all their arrangements, that it is almost impossible\r\nto distinguish between their plans on paper. They are both square halls\r\nmeasuring more than 40 ft. each side, without any pillars in the centre,\r\nand are surrounded on three sides by sixteen cells of nearly the same\r\ndimensions. On the fourth side is a six-pillared verandah, in the one\r\ncase with a cell at each end, in the other with only one cell, which is\r\nthe most marked distinction between the two plans. The architecture,\r\ntoo, is in some respects so similar that we can hardly hesitate in\r\nassuming that the one is an intentional copy of the other. It is in fact\r\nthe problem of the great cave at Kenheri, being a copy of that at Karli\r\nrepeated here.[182] Only the difference in age between the two chaityas\r\nbeing five centuries, the degradation in style is greater than here,\r\nwhere it appears to be little more than two.\r\n\r\nThe pillars in the verandah of cave No. 8 (Woodcut No. 79, p. 150) are\r\nso similar to those in the great Karli chaitya, that if it should turn\r\nout, as Justice Newton[183] supposes, that Nahapana was the founder of\r\nthe Samvat era, 56 B.C., there would be nothing in the architecture to\r\ncontradict such a date. According to Mr. West, “the pillars are shorter\r\nin proportion, and the human figures more rudely designed;”[184] but\r\nwhether to such an extent as to justify an interval of nearly two\r\ncenturies is not quite clear. On the other hand no vihara I know of on\r\nthis side of India has a facade so richly ornamented as this. Those at\r\nBhaja and Bedsa are quite plain, and those around Karli, though richer,\r\nare far inferior to this, so that on the whole the architectural\r\nevidence tends strongly to a date subsequent to the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on this cave says, that it was excavated by Ushavadata,\r\nson-in-law of Nahapana, viceroy under King Kshaharatra,[185] evidently a\r\nforeigner, whose proper name has not yet been discovered, but for\r\nreasons given in the Appendix, there seems little doubt but that the\r\nSaka era (A.D. 78-9) dates from his coronation, and as some years must\r\nhave elapsed before the son-in-law of the viceroy could have been in a\r\nposition to undertake such a work as this, I presume A.D. 100 is not far\r\nfrom the date of the cave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 79. Pillar in Nahapana Cave, Nassick. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. Pillar in Gautamiputra Cave, Nassick. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe pillars of the Gautamiputra cave No. 3 have, as will be seen from\r\nthe last woodcut (No. 80), lost much of the elegance of those last\r\ndescribed. Instead of the graceful bell-shaped Persian capitals, we have\r\nthe pudding forms that afterwards became so prevalent. The shafts are\r\nstraight posts, and have no bases, and the whole shows an inferiority\r\nnot to be mistaken. The richly carved and sculptured doorway also\r\nbelongs to a much more modern age. Besides this, there are three things\r\nhere which prove almost incontestably that it belongs to the same age as\r\nthe Amravati tope erected in the 4th century--the rail in front, already\r\ngiven (Woodcut No. 36), the pilaster at the end of the verandah,[186]\r\nand the bas-relief of a dagoba, which occupies the same position on the\r\nback wall in this cave that the man with the club occupies in No. 8. It\r\nhas the same attendants, and the same superfluity of umbrellas, as are\r\nfound there,[187] so that altogether the age of the excavation can\r\nhardly be considered doubtful.\r\n\r\nCave No. 12 is a small vihara, the central hall being 30 ft. by 23 ft.,\r\nand with only four cells on one side. Considerable alterations have been\r\nattempted in its interior at some date long subsequent to its first\r\nexcavation, to adapt it apparently to Hindu worship. Its verandah,\r\nhowever, consisting of two attached and two free-standing columns, is\r\nundoubtedly of the same age as the Nahapana cave No. 8. An inscription\r\nupon it states that it was excavated by Indragnidatta, prince regnant\r\nunder Patamitraka of the northern region.[188] None of these names can\r\nbe recognised, but they point to an age when foreign kings, possibly of\r\nthe Punjab, ruled this country by satraps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 81. Yadnya Sri Cave, Nassick. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe great vihara beyond the chaitya cave, and 12 ft. above its level, is\r\none of the most important of the series, not only from its size, but\r\nfrom its ordinance and date (Woodcut No. 81). The hall is 60 ft. in\r\ndepth by 40 ft. wide at the outer end, increasing to 45 ft. at the\r\ninner, and with eight cells on either side. The most marked peculiarity,\r\nhowever, is that it has a regular sanctuary at its inner end, with two\r\nrichly-carved pillars in front (Woodcut No. 82, p. 152), and within, a\r\ncolossal figure of Buddha, seated, with flying and standing attendants,\r\ndwarpals, dwarfs, and all the usual accompaniments usually found in the\r\nfifth and subsequent centuries, but never, so far as I know, before.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have in this cave an inscription containing a well-known\r\nname. It is said to have been excavated by the wife of the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Emperor Yadnya Sri, Sat Karni, descendant of\r\nKing Gautamiputra, in the seventh year.[189] We are not able to fix the\r\nexact year to which this date refers; probably it was only regnal, but\r\nit does not seem doubtful that this king reigned in the first quarter of\r\nthe 5th century, and we consequently have in this cave a fixed point on\r\nwhich to base our calculations for the period about the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 82. Pillar in Yadnya Sri Cave. (From a Drawing by Mr.\r\nBurgess.)]\r\n\r\nBeyond this there is still another excavation, No. 17--it can hardly be\r\ncalled a vihara--of very irregular shape, and covered with sculpture of\r\na date at least a century more modern than that of the cave last\r\ndescribed. Buddha is there represented in all his attitudes, standing or\r\nsitting, accompanied by chowrie bearers, flying figures, dwarfs, &c. On\r\none side is a colossal recumbent figure of him attaining Nirvana, which\r\nis a sure sign of a very modern date. Besides these, there are Dyani\r\nBuddhas, Bodhisatwas, and all the modern pantheon of Buddhism, arranged\r\nin most admired confusion, as in all the most modern caves. There is no\r\ninscription, but from its sculpture and the form of its pillars we may\r\nsafely ascribe it to the last age of Buddhist art, say about the year\r\n600 or later. The pillars approximate closely in style to those found at\r\nElephanta, and in the Brahmanical caves at Ellora, which from other\r\nevidence have been assigned to dates varying from 600 to 800 years of\r\nour era.\r\n\r\nMore has perhaps been said about the Nassick caves than their\r\narchitectural importance would seem at first sight to justify, but they\r\nare one of the most important of the purely Buddhist groups, and they\r\nhave hardly yet been alluded to in European books. Their great merit,\r\nhowever, is that they belong to one of the most important of the older\r\nIndian dynasties, known as the Andrabrityas, Sata Karnis, or\r\nSatavahanas. Being of purely Indian extraction, they, however, did not\r\ncoin money like the Punjab dynasties, nor their contemporaries and\r\nrivals the Sah kings of Gujerat, who brought the art with them when they\r\ncame as conquerors from the north-west, where they had learnt the art\r\nfrom the Greeks. This dynasty has, consequently, been overlooked by\r\nnumismatists and others, and can only be rehabilitated by their\r\ninscriptions and their architectural work, on which these are found\r\ninscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAJUNTA VIHARAS.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the central group of the four oldest caves at\r\nAjunta forms the nucleus from which the caves radiate north and\r\nsouth--eight in one direction, and fourteen in the other. It seems,\r\nhowever, that there was a pause in the excavation of caves after the\r\nfirst great effort, and that they were then extended, for some time at\r\nleast, in a southern direction. Thus caves Nos. 13 to 20 form a\r\ntolerably consecutive series, without any violent break. After that, or\r\nit may be contemporaneously with the last named, may be grouped Nos. 8,\r\n7, and 6; and, lastly, Nos. 21 to 26 at one end of the series, and Nos.\r\n1 to 5 at the other, form the latest and most ornate group of the whole\r\nseries.[190]\r\n\r\nAs above explained of the central four, three are certainly anterior to\r\nthe Christian Era. One, No. 10, being transitional in some of its\r\nfeatures, may belong to the 1st century, and be consequently\r\ncontemporary with the gateways at Sanchi. After this first effort,\r\nhowever, came the pause just alluded to, for Nos. 13, 14, and 15, which\r\nare the only caves we can safely assign to the next three centuries, are\r\ncomparatively insignificant, either in extent or in richness of detail.\r\n\r\nLeaving these, we come to two viharas, Nos. 16 and 17, which are the\r\nmost beautiful here, and, taken in conjunction with their paintings,\r\nprobably the most interesting viharas in India.\r\n\r\nNo. 16 is a twenty-pillared cave, measuring about 65 ft. each way\r\n(Woodcut No. 83, p. 154), with sixteen cells and a regular sanctuary, in\r\nwhich is a figure of Buddha, seated, with his feet down. The general\r\nappearance of the interior may be judged of by the following woodcut\r\n(No. 84) in outline, but only a coloured representation in much\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 83. Plan of Cave No. 16, at Ajunta. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 84. View of Interior of Vihara No. 16, at Ajunta. (From a\r\nSketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\ngreater detail could give an idea of the richness of effect produced by\r\nits decoration. All the walls are covered with frescoes representing\r\nscenes from the life of Buddha, or from the legends of saints, and the\r\nroof and pillars by arabesques and ornaments, generally of great beauty\r\nof outline, heightened by the most harmonious colouring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 85. View in Cave No. 17, at Ajunta. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nNo. 17, which is very similar in plan, is generally known as the Zodiac\r\ncave, from the figure of a Buddhist chakra or wheel painted at one end\r\nof its verandah, which was mistaken by early visitors for a celestial\r\nemblem. The general effect of its architecture internally may be\r\ngathered from the above woodcut (No. 85) from a photograph, or from the\r\nnext woodcut (No. 86) representing one of its pillars to a larger scale,\r\nfrom which the curiously wooden construction of the roof will be better\r\nobserved than from the photograph. It is, in fact, the usual mode of\r\nforming flat or terraced roofs at the present day throughout India, and\r\nwhich consequently does not seem to have\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 86. Pillar in Vihara No. 17, at Ajunta. (From a Sketch by\r\nthe Author.)]\r\n\r\nvaried from the 5th century at all events. As may be gathered from these\r\nillustrations the pillars in these caves are almost indefinitely varied,\r\ngenerally in pairs, but no pillars in any one cave are at all like those\r\nin any other. In each cave, however, there is a general harmony of\r\ndesign and of form, which prevents their variety from being unpleasing.\r\nThe effect on the contrary is singularly harmonious and satisfactory.\r\nThe great interest of these two caves lies, however, in their frescoes,\r\nwhich represent Buddhist legends on a scale and with a distinctness\r\nfound nowhere else in India. The sculptures of Amravati--some of which\r\nmay be contemporary, or only slightly earlier--are what most nearly\r\napproach them; but, as in most cases, painting admits of greater freedom\r\nand greater variety of incident than sculpture ever does, and certainly\r\nin this instance vindicates its claim to greater phonetic power. Many of\r\nthe frets and architectural details painted on the roofs and pillars of\r\nthese and in viharas are also of great elegance and appropriateness,\r\nand, when combined with the architecture, make up a whole unrivalled in\r\nIndia for its ethnographic as well as for its architectural beauty.\r\n\r\nFortunately the age of these two caves is not doubtful; there is a long\r\ninscription on each, much mutilated it must be confessed, but of which\r\nenough can be made out to show that they were excavated by kings of the\r\nVindhyasacti race, one of whom, Pravarasena, whose name appears in the\r\ninscription on No. 16, married a daughter of Maharaja Deva, alias\r\nChandra-gupta.[191] We have inscriptions of the last king dated 82 and\r\n93 of the Gupta era, or in A.D. 400 and 411, and his son-in-law may\r\nprobably have reigned a few years later. We may consequently safely\r\nplace these two caves in the first half of the 5th century. They are\r\nthus slightly more modern than the Yadnya Sri cave, No. 15, at Nassick,\r\nwhich is exactly the result we would expect to arrive at from their\r\narchitecture and the form of their sanctuaries.\r\n\r\nTheir great interest, therefore, from a historical point of view,\r\nconsists in their being almost unique specimens of the architecture and\r\narts of India during the great Gupta period, when Theodosius II. was\r\nemperor of the East, and at a time when Bahram Gaur, the Sassanian, is\r\nsaid to have visited India. He reigned 420 to 440; if he did visit\r\nIndia, it must have been while they were in course of being\r\nexcavated.[192]\r\n\r\nNos. 18, 19, and 20 succeed this group, both in position and in style,\r\nand probably occupied the remaining half of the 5th century in\r\nconstruction, bringing down our history to about A.D. 500.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further in this direction, the cave-diggers seem to\r\nhave turned back and excavated Nos. 8, 7, and 6. The last named is the\r\nonly two-storeyed cave at Ajunta, and would be very interesting if it\r\nwere not so fearfully ruined by damp and decay, owing to the faulty\r\nnature of the rock in which it is excavated. No. 7 has a singularly\r\nelegant verandah, broken by two projecting pavilions.[193] Internally,\r\nit is small, and occupied by a whole pantheon of Buddhas. It resembles,\r\nin fact, in almost every respect, No. 17 at Nassick, with which it is,\r\nno doubt, contemporary.\r\n\r\nThere still remain the five first caves at the northern end, and the six\r\nlast at the southern: one of these is a chaitya, the other ten are\r\nviharas of greater or less dimensions. Some are only commenced, and\r\ntwo, Nos. 4 and 24, which were intended to have been the finest of the\r\nseries, are left in a very incomplete state: interesting, however, as\r\nshowing the whole process of an excavation from its commencement to its\r\ncompletion. Both these were intended to be 28-pillared caves, and the\r\nhall of No. 4 measures 84 ft. by 89 ft.\r\n\r\nCaves Nos. 1 and 2 are among the most richly-sculptured of the caves.\r\nThe façade, indeed, of No. 1 is the most elaborate and beautiful of its\r\nclass at Ajunta, and with the corresponding caves at the opposite end\r\nconveys a higher idea of the perfection to which decorative sculpture\r\nhad attained at that age than anything else at Ajunta. With the last\r\nchaitya, which belongs to this group, these caves carry our history down\r\ncertainly into the 7th century. The work in the unfinished caves, I\r\nfancy, must have been arrested by the troubles which took place in\r\nCentral India about the year 650, or shortly afterwards, when, I fancy,\r\nthe persecution of the Buddhists commenced, and after which it is hardly\r\nprobable that any community of that faith would have leisure or means to\r\ncarry out any works, on such a scale at least, as these Ajunta viharas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible, without a much greater amount of\r\nillustration than is compatible with the nature of this work, to convey\r\nto those who have not seen them any idea of the various points of\r\ninterest found in these caves; but it is to be hoped that a complete\r\nseries of illustrations of them may be one day given to the world. The\r\nmaterials for this nearly existed when the disastrous fire at the\r\nCrystal Palace, in 1860, destroyed Major Gill’s facsimiles of the\r\npaintings, which can hardly now be replaced.[194] A good deal, however,\r\nmay be, and it is hoped will be, done, as they afford a complete series\r\nof examples of Buddhist art without any admixture from Hinduism, or any\r\nother religion extending from 200 years before Christ to 600 or 700\r\nyears after his era; and besides illustrating the arts and feelings of\r\nthose ages, they form a chronometric scale by which to judge of, and\r\nsynchronise other known series with which, however, they differ in\r\nseveral important particulars. For instance, at Ajunta there is no\r\nsingle example of those bell-shaped Persian capitals to pillars, with\r\nwaterpot bases; nor is there any example of animals with riders crowning\r\nthe capitals, such as are found at Bedsa, Karli, Nassick, Salsette, and\r\nelsewhere in the Ghâts. These differences seem to point to a western\r\ninfluence, Persian, Saka, or Scythian, or by whatever name we like to\r\ndesignate it, which did not penetrate so far inland as Ajunta or Ellora,\r\nbut was confined to those regions where we know the foreign influence\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nThese, and many more ethnographic distinctions in architecture will, no\r\ndoubt, be brought out by careful examination and comparisons, from\r\nwhich, when made, it can hardly be doubted that the most important\r\nresults will be derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAGH.\r\n\r\nAt a distance about 150 miles a little west of north from Ajunta, and\r\nthirty miles west of Mandu, near a little village of the name of Bagh,\r\nthere exists a series of viharas only little less interesting than the\r\nlater series at Ajunta. They are situated in a secluded ravine in the\r\nside of the range of hills that bounds the valley of the Nerbudda on the\r\nnorth, and were first visited or at least first described by Lieutenant\r\nDangerfield, in the second volume of the ‘Transactions of the Literary\r\nSociety of Bombay.’ They have since been described more in detail by Dr.\r\nImpey in the fifth volume of the ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society.’ Unfortunately the plates that were to accompany that\r\npaper were not published with it, but being deposited by the author in\r\nthe library of the India Office, they are now before me, and from them\r\nand from this paper the principal details that follow have been gleaned.\r\n\r\nThe series consists of eight or nine viharas, some of them of the very\r\nfirst class, but no chaitya hall, nor does any excavation of that class\r\nseem ever to have been attempted here. On the other hand, the larger\r\nviharas seem to have had a shala or schoolroom attached to them, which\r\nmay also have been employed for divine service. The fact, however, that\r\nthe sanctuaries of the viharas generally have a dagoba in them, instead\r\nof an image of Buddha, points to a distinction which may hereafter prove\r\nof value. On the whole they are purer and simpler than the latest at\r\nAjunta, though most probably of about the same age.\r\n\r\nThe plan of one has already been given, but it is neither so large nor\r\narchitecturally so important as the great vihara, shown in plan, Woodcut\r\nNo. 87. Its great hall is 96 ft. square, and would at Ajunta rank as a\r\ntwenty-eight pillared cave, like No. 4 there, but inside this are eight\r\npillars ranged octagonally; and at a later age, apparently in\r\nconsequence of some failure of the roof, four structural\r\npillars--shaded lighter--were introduced. It is not clear from Dr.\r\nImpey’s description how the central octagon was originally roofed. He\r\nseems to have believed that a dagoba originally stood in the centre, and\r\nhaving been destroyed brought down the roof with it. As, however, there\r\nis a dagoba in the sanctuary, this is hardly probable, and it seems much\r\nmore likely that it was a copy of a structural octagonal dome, such as\r\nwe find the Jains invariably employing a few centuries afterwards. If\r\nthis is so, it would be highly interesting that it should be examined by\r\nsome architect capable of restoring it constructively from such\r\nindications as remain. We have hundreds, almost thousands, of these\r\ndomes supported on eight pillars after the revival in the 10th century,\r\nbut not one before. If this is one, it might help to restore a missing\r\nlink in our chain of evidence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 87. Great Vihara, at Bagh. (From a Plan by Dr. Impey.)]\r\n\r\nThe shala connected with this vihara measures 94 ft. by 44 ft., and the\r\ntwo are joined together by a verandah measuring 220 ft. in length,\r\nadorned by twenty free-standing pillars. At one time the whole of the\r\nback wall of this gallery was adorned with a series of frescoes,\r\nequalling in beauty and in interest those of Ajunta. As in those at\r\nAjunta, the uninitiated would fail to trace among them any symptoms of\r\nBuddhism as generally understood. The principal subjects are processions\r\non horseback, or on elephants. In the latter the number of women exceeds\r\nthat of the men. Dancing and love-making are as usual prominently\r\nintroduced, and only one small picture, containing two men, can be said\r\nto be appropriated to worship.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, no man or woman has any covering on their heads, and\r\nthe men generally have the hair cropped short, and with only very small\r\nmoustaches on the face. Some half-dozen are as dark as the Indians of\r\nthe present day. The rest are very much fairer, many as fair as\r\nSpaniards, and nearly all wear coloured dresses.\r\n\r\nWe are not at present in a position to say, and may not for a long time\r\nbe able to feel sure, who the races are that are represented in these\r\nfrescoes or in those at Ajunta. Negatively we may probably be justified\r\nin asserting that they are not the ancestors of the present inhabitants\r\nof Rajputana, nor of any of the native races--Bhîls, Gonds, or such\r\nlike. Are they Sakas, Yavanas, or any of the trans-Indus tribes who, in\r\nthe first centuries of the Christian Era flowed into India across that\r\nriver, bringing with them their arts and religious forms? The style of\r\nart, especially at Bagh, is very similar to that of Persia at about the\r\nsame date.\r\n\r\nThe date of this group of caves seems hardly doubtful. The earliest\r\ncould not well have been commenced much before A.D. 500; the date of the\r\nlatest, if our chronology is correct, could not well be carried down\r\nbeyond 650 or 700, unless it was, that the troubles that convulsed the\r\nrest of India after that date did not reach those remote valleys in\r\nRajputana till some time afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALSETTE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive, but one of the least satisfactory of all the\r\ngroups of Indian caves, is that generally known as the Kenheri Caves on\r\nthe Island of Salsette in Bombay Harbour. The great chaitya cave there,\r\nas mentioned above, is only a bad copy of the Karli cave, and was\r\nexcavated in the beginning of the 5th century, and none of the viharas\r\nseem to be earlier. The place, however, must have had some sanctity at\r\nan earlier date, for there seems no doubt that a tooth of Buddha was\r\nenshrined here in the beginning of the 4th century, when these relics\r\nwere revolutionising the Buddhist world at least at two diametrically\r\nopposite points of the coast of India, at Puri, and in this island.[195]\r\nIt may have been in consequence of the visit of this relic that the\r\nisland became holy, and it may have been because it was an island, that\r\nit remained undisturbed by the troubles of the mainland, and that the\r\npractice of excavating caves lasted longer here than in any series above\r\ndescribed. Be this as it may, the caves here go straggling on till they\r\nfade by almost imperceptible degrees into those of the Hindu religion.\r\nThe Hindu caves of Montpezir, Kundoty, and Amboli are so like them, and\r\nthe change takes place so gradually, that it is sometimes difficult to\r\ndraw the line between the two religions.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, we have not at Salsette any viharas that can\r\ncompare with those of Nassick, Ajunta, or Bagh, and they nowhere form a\r\nseries which might assist us in guessing their dates, yet, just because\r\nthey are so late, and because they do fade so gradually into the next\r\nphase, are they worthy of more attention than has been bestowed upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs these caves are so near Bombay, and so easily accessible, it seems\r\nstrange that they have lately been so much neglected, and no one seems\r\nto have visited, or at least described, the outlying groups. What we\r\nknow of those of Montpezir or Amboli is derived from Daniell’s\r\ndrawings,[196] made at the end of the last century, or from the travels\r\nof Lord Valentia or Niebuhr.[197] The Kenheri group is better known, and\r\nI can speak of them from personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nA plan of one has already been given (Woodcut No. 77). It is a\r\ntwo-storeyed vihara, and one of the finest here, though it would not be\r\nconsidered remarkable anywhere else. Another, of which a representation\r\nis given in my ‘Rock-cut Temples,’ plate 19, represents Avalokiteswara\r\nwith ten heads,--the only instance I know of in India, though it is\r\ncommon in Thibet in modern times.[198] The others are generally mere\r\ncells, or natural caverns slightly improved by art, and hardly worthy of\r\nillustration in a general history, though a monograph of these caves\r\nwould be a most valuable addition to our scanty stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nDHUMNAR AND KHOLVI.\r\n\r\nThere are no viharas at either of these places which can at all compare,\r\neither in dimensions or in interest, with those already described. The\r\nlargest, at Dhumnar, is that already given in combination with the\r\nchaitya, Woodcut No. 65, and, though important, is evidently\r\ntransitional to another state of matters. Next to this is one called the\r\nGreat Kacheri; but it is only a six-celled vihara, with a hall about 25\r\nft. square, encumbered by four pillars on its floor; and near the\r\nchaitya above alluded to is a similar hall, but smaller and without\r\ncells. At Kholvi there is nothing that can correctly be called a vihara\r\nat all. There is, indeed, one large hall, called Bhim’s home, measuring\r\n42 ft. by 22 ft.; but it has no cells, and is much more like what would\r\nbe called a shala at Bagh than a vihara. The others are mere cells, of\r\nno architectural importance.[199]\r\n\r\nThe fact seems to be that when these two groups of caves were being\r\nexcavated Buddhism was fast losing its original characteristics, and\r\nfading into the bastard Brahmanism that succeeded it. When that took\r\nplace, we cannot at present exactly say; but I cannot help fancying that\r\nthis religion may have lingered on, and flourished in the remote wilds\r\nof Rajputana[200] or in the island of Salsette long after it had been\r\ndriven from the neighbourhood of the great cities and from the populous\r\nand well-cultivated plains; and these caves, especially those of Kholvi,\r\nmay have been excavated in the 8th or even in the 9th century of our\r\nera.\r\n\r\n\r\nELLORA.\r\n\r\nAt Ellora there are numerous viharas attached to the Viswakarma, or the\r\ngreat chaitya above described (p. 128). Like it, however, they are all\r\nmodern, but on that very account interesting, as showing more clearly\r\nthan elsewhere the steps by which Buddhist cave-architecture faded into\r\nthat of the Hindus. Every step of the process can be clearly traced\r\nhere, though the precise date at which the change took place cannot yet\r\nbe fixed with certainty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 88. Plan of Dehrwarra, Ellora. (From Daniel’s ‘Views.’)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe great vihara, which is also evidently contemporary with the chaitya,\r\nis known as the Dehrwarra, and, as will be seen from the plan (Woodcut\r\nNo. 88), differs considerably from any of those illustrated above. Its\r\ndimensions are considerable, being 110 ft. in depth by 70 ft. across the\r\ncentral recesses, its great defect being the lowness of its roof. Its\r\nform, too, is exceptional. It looks more like a flat-roofed chaitya,\r\nwith its three aisles, than an ordinary vihara; and such it probably was\r\nintended to be, and, if so, it is curious to observe that at Bedsa\r\n(Woodcut No. 49) we had one of the earliest complete viharas, looking\r\nlike a chaitya in plan; and here we have one of the latest, showing the\r\nsame confusion of ideas; a thing very common in architectural history,\r\nwhere a new style or a new arrangement generally hampers itself with\r\ncopying some incongruous form, which it casts off during its vigorous\r\nmanhood, but to which it returns in its decrepitude--a sure sign that it\r\nis passing away.\r\n\r\nClose to the Viswakarma is a small and very pretty vihara, in which the\r\nsanctuary stands free, with a passage all round it, as in some of the\r\nSaiva caves further on; and the appearance of the warders on each side\r\nof the door would lead one rather to expect an image of Siva inside than\r\nthe Buddha which actually occupies it. The details, however, of its\r\narchitecture are the same as in the great cave.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with this one is a small square vihara, the roof of which\r\nis supported by four pillars of the same detail as the Dookya Ghur,\r\nwhich is the cave next it on the north; but though surrounded by cells\r\nit has no sanctuary or images.\r\n\r\nHigher up the hill than these are two others containing numerous cells,\r\nand one with a very handsome hall, the outer half of which has\r\nunfortunately fallen in; enough, however, remains to show not only its\r\nplan, but all the details, which very much resemble those of the last\r\ngroup of viharas at Ajunta.\r\n\r\nIn the sanctuaries of most of these caves are figures of Buddhas sitting\r\nwith their feet down. On each side of the image in the principal one are\r\nnine figures of Buddhas, or rather Bodhisatwas, seated cross-legged, and\r\nbelow them three and three figures, some cross-legged, and others\r\nstanding, probably devotees, and one of them a woman.\r\n\r\nNeither of these caves have been entirely finished.\r\n\r\nThere is still another group of these small viharas, called the\r\nChumarwarra, or (if I understand correctly) the Chumars’ (or\r\n‘shoe-makers’) quarter. The first is square, with twelve pillars on the\r\nsame plan as those at Ajunta, though the detail is similar to the\r\nViswakarma. There are cells, and in the sanctuary Buddha sitting with\r\nthe feet down; it never has been finished, and is now much ruined.\r\n\r\nThe second is similar in plan, though the pillars are of the cushion\r\nform of Elephanta and the Dehrwarra, but the capitals are much better\r\nformed than in the last example, and more ornamented; the lateral\r\ngalleries here contain figures of Buddha, all like the one in the\r\nsanctuary, sitting with their feet down, and there are only two cells on\r\neach side of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe last is a small plain vihara with cells, but without pillars, and\r\nmuch ruined.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the caves in this group resemble one another so much in\r\ndetail and execution that it is difficult to make out any succession\r\namong them, and it is probable that they were all excavated within the\r\nsame century as the Viswakarma.\r\n\r\nThe next three temples are particularly interesting to the antiquarian,\r\nas pointing out the successive steps by which the Buddhistical caves\r\nmerged into the Brahmanical.\r\n\r\nThe first is the Do Tal, or Dookya Ghur, a Buddhist vihara of two\r\nstoreys; most of its details are so similar to those above described\r\nthat it may be assumed to be, without doubt, of the same age. It is\r\nstrictly Buddhistic in all its details, and shows no more tendency\r\ntowards Brahmanism than what was pointed out in speaking of the\r\nViswakarma. It apparently was intended to have had three storeys, but\r\nhas been left unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe next, or Teen Tal, is very similar to the last in arrangement and\r\ndetail, and its sculptures are all Buddhistical, though deviating so far\r\nfrom the usual simplicity of that style as almost to justify the\r\nBrahmans in appropriating them as they have done.\r\n\r\nThe third, the Das Avatar, is another two-storeyed cave, very similar in\r\nall its architectural details to the two preceding, but the sculptures\r\nare all Brahmanical. At first sight, it seems as if the excavation had\r\nbeen made by the Buddhists, and appropriated and finished by their\r\nsuccessors. This may be true to a certain extent, but on a more careful\r\nexamination it appears more probable that we owe it entirely to the\r\nBrahmans. It is evidently the earliest Brahmanical temple here, and it\r\nis natural to suppose that when the Saivites first attempted to rival\r\ntheir antagonists in cave-temples they should follow the only models\r\nthat existed, merely appropriating them to their own worship. The\r\ncircumstance, however, that makes this most probable, is the existence\r\nof a pseudo-structural mantapa, or shrine of Nundi, in the courtyard;\r\nthis evidently must have been a part of the original design, or the rock\r\nwould not have been left here for it, and it is a model of the usual\r\nstructural building found in Saiva temples in different parts of India.\r\nThis is a piece of bad grammar the Buddhists never were guilty of; their\r\nexcavations always are caves, whilst the great characteristic of\r\nBrahmanical excavations, as distinguished from that of their\r\npredecessors, is that they generally copied structural buildings: a\r\nsystem that rose to its greatest height in the Kylas, to be described\r\nfurther on. The Buddhist excavations, on the contrary, were always caves\r\nand nothing else.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, in the present state of our knowledge, to determine\r\nwhether the Ellora Buddhist group is later or earlier than those of\r\nDhumnar and Kholvi. It is certainly finer than either, and conforms more\r\nclosely with the traditions of the style in its palmiest days; but that\r\nmay be owing to local circumstances, of which we have no precise\r\nknowledge. The manner, however, in which it fades into the Hindu group\r\nis in itself sufficient to prove how late it is. If we take A.D. 600 as\r\nthe medium date for the Viswakarma and its surroundings, and A.D. 750 as\r\na time when the last trace of Buddhism had disappeared from western\r\nIndia, we shall probably not err to any great extent; but we must wait\r\nfor some inscriptions or more precise data before attempting to speak\r\nwith precision on the subject.\r\n\r\nA great deal more requires to be done before this great cartoon can be\r\nfilled up with anything like completeness; but in the meanwhile it is\r\nsatisfactory to know that in these “rock-cut temples,” eked out by the\r\nfew structural examples that exist, we have a complete history of the\r\narts and liturgies of the Buddhists for the thousand years that ranged\r\nfrom B.C. 250 to A.D. 750; and that, when any one with zeal and\r\nintelligence enough for the purpose will devote himself to the task, he\r\nwill be able to give us a more vivid and far more authentic account of\r\nthis remarkable form of faith than can be gathered from any books whose\r\nexistence is now known to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIR.\r\n\r\nWhen the history of the cave-temples of western India comes to be\r\nwritten in anything like a complete and exhaustive manner, the groups\r\nsituated near and around the town of Junir, about half-way between\r\nNassick and Poonah, will occupy a prominent position in the series.\r\nThere are not, it is true, in this locality any chaityas so magnificent\r\nas that at Karli, nor any probably so old as those at Bhaja and Bedsa;\r\nbut there is one chaitya, both in plan and dimensions, very like that at\r\nNassick and probably of the same age, and one vihara, at least, quite\r\nequal to the finest at that place. The great interest of the series,\r\nhowever, consists in its possessing examples of forms not known\r\nelsewhere. There are, for instance, certainly two, probably three,\r\nchaitya caves, with square terminations and without internal pillars,\r\nand one circular cave which is quite unique so far as we at present\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThese caves have long been known to antiquarians. In 1833 Colonel Sykes\r\npublished a series of inscriptions copied from them, but without any\r\ndescription of the caves themselves.[201] In 1847, Dr. Bird noticed them\r\nin his ‘Historical Researches,’ with some wretched lithographs, so bad\r\nas to be almost unintelligible; in 1850, Dr. Wilson described them in\r\nthe ‘Bombay Journal;’ and in 1857 Dr. Stevenson republished their\r\ninscriptions, with translations, in the eighth volume of the same\r\njournal; and lastly Mr. Sinclair of the Bombay Civil Service, wrote an\r\naccount of them in the ‘Indian Antiquary’ for February, 1874.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, we are still without drawings or photographs\r\nwhich would enable us to understand their peculiarities. The late Dr.\r\nBhau Daji had a set of negatives taken, but never would allow any prints\r\nto be made from them; and, when Mr. Burgess visited the caves last\r\nautumn, he did not take a photographic apparatus with him, as he\r\ndepended on obtaining, through Government, the use of Dr. Bhau Daji’s\r\nnegatives. This has not yet been effected, and till it is this series is\r\nhardly available for the purposes of our history, yet it can hardly be\r\npassed over in silence.\r\n\r\nThe great peculiarity of the group is the extreme simplicity of the\r\ncaves composing it. They are too early to have any figures of Buddha\r\nhimself, but there are not even any of these figures of men and women\r\nwhich we meet with at Karli and elsewhere. Everything at Junir wears an\r\naspect of simplicity and severity, due partly to the antiquity of the\r\ncaves of course, but, so far as at present known, unequalled elsewhere.\r\nOne exception--but it is in the most modern cave here--is that Sri, with\r\nher two elephants pouring water over her, occupies the frontispiece of a\r\nchaitya cave.[202] Though so ubiquitous and continuous through all ages,\r\nit is seldom this goddess occupies so very important a position as she\r\ndoes here; but her history has still to be written.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 89. Circular Cave, Junir. (From a Plan by Mr. Burgess.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 90. Section of Circular Cave, Junir. (From a Drawing by\r\nMr. Burgess.) Scale 25 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed plan and section (Woodcuts Nos. 89, 90) will explain the\r\nform of the circular cave above alluded to. It is not large, only 25 ft.\r\n6 in. across, while its roof is supported by twelve plain octagonal\r\npillars which surround the dagoba. The tee has been removed from the\r\ndagoba to convert it into a lingam of Siva, in which form it is now\r\nworshipped; a fact that suggests the idea--I fancy a very probable\r\none--that the lingam is really a miniature dagoba, though bearing a\r\ndifferent meaning now, and that it was really originally copied from\r\nthat Buddhist emblem. The interest of the arrangement of this cave will\r\nbe more apparent when we come to describe the dagobas at Ceylon, which\r\nwere encircled with pillars in the same manner as this one. Meanwhile\r\nthe annexed representation (Woodcut No. 91) of a circular temple from\r\nthe Buddhist sculptures at Bharhut may enable us to realise, to some\r\nextent at least, the external form of these temples, which probably were\r\nmuch more common in ancient times than any remains we now possess would\r\njustify us in assuming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 91. Round Temple and part of Palace, from a bas-relief at\r\nBharhut.]\r\n\r\nBesides this group at Junir, there is one apparently equally extensive\r\nnear Aurungabad, and two others, still more extensive, at Daraseo, or\r\nDarasinha, and at Hazar Kotri, in the Nizam’s territories; but they are\r\neven less known than the Junir group, and there are several others whose\r\nexistence is only known to us by hearsay. If Mr. Burgess is enabled to\r\ncontinue his explorations a few years longer, they may be brought within\r\nthe domain of history. At present, like those at Junir, they are not\r\navailable for any historical or scientific purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGANDHARA MONASTERIES.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nMonasteries at Jamalgiri, Takht-i-Bahi, and Shah Dehri.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew of the recent discoveries in India promise to be more fruitful of\r\nimportant results for the elucidation of the archæology of India than\r\nthose obtained from the recent excavations of ruined monasteries in the\r\nneighbourhood of Peshawur. A great deal still remains to be done before\r\nwe can speak with certainty with regard either to their age or origin,\r\nbut enough is known of them to make it certain that the materials there\r\nexist for settling not only the question of the amount of influence\r\nclassical art exercised on that of India, but also for solving many\r\nproblems of Buddhist archæology and art.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, it is from their coins, and from them only, that the\r\nnames of most of the kings of Bactria and their successors have been\r\nrecovered; but we have not yet found a vestige of a building that can be\r\nsaid to have been erected by them or in their age, nor one piece of\r\nsculpture that, so far as we now know, could have been executed before\r\ntheir downfall, about B.C. 130. This, however, may be owing to the fact\r\nthat Bactria proper has long been inhabited by fanatic Moslems, who\r\ndestroy any representations of the human form they meet with, and no\r\nexcavations for hidden examples have yet been undertaken in their\r\ncountry; while it is still uncertain how far the influence of the true\r\nBactrians extended eastward, and whether, in fact, they ever really\r\npossessed the valley of Peshawur, where all the sculptures yet\r\ndiscovered have been found. No one, in fact, suspected their existence\r\nin our own territory till Lieutenants Lumsden and Stokes, in 1852,\r\npartially explored the half-buried monastery at Jamalgiri, which had\r\nbeen discovered by General Cunningham in 1848. It is situated about\r\nthirty-six miles north-east from Peshawur, and from it these officers\r\nexcavated a considerable number of sculptures, which afterwards came\r\ninto the possession of the Hon. E. Clive Bayley. He published an account\r\nof them in the ‘Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society,’ in 1853, and\r\nbrought the collection itself over to this country. Unfortunately, they\r\nwere utterly destroyed in the disastrous fire that occurred at the\r\nCrystal Palace, where they were being exhibited in 1860, and this\r\nbefore they had been photographed, or any serious attempt made to\r\ncompare them with other sculptures.\r\n\r\nSince that time other collections have been dug out of another monastery\r\neight miles further westward, at a place called Takht-i-Bahi, and by Dr.\r\nBellew at a third locality, ten miles southward, called Sahri Bhalol,\r\nsome of which have found their way to this country; and two years ago\r\nDr. Leitner brought home an extensive collection, principally from\r\nTakht-i-Bahi. The bulk of the sculptures found in these places have been\r\ndeposited in the Lahore Museum, where upwards of 800 specimens of this\r\nclass of art now exist, and many are being added every season. Some of\r\nthese have been photographed,[203] and these representations, together\r\nwith the specimens brought home, are sufficient to enable a student to\r\nobtain a fair general idea of the art they represent. The worst thing\r\nis, that the excavations have been so unsystematically carried on that\r\nit is impossible to ascertain in most instances where the sculptures\r\ncame from,[204] and in almost no instance can the position of any one\r\npiece of sculpture be fixed with anything like certainty.[205]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following plans (Woodcuts Nos. 92, 93), of the two principal\r\nmonasteries which have been excavated in the vicinity of Peshawur, will\r\nexplain their arrangements in so far as they have yet been made out. As\r\nwill be seen at a glance, they are very similar to each other,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 92. Plan of Monastery at Jamalgiri. Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 93. Plan of Monastery at Takht-i-Bahi. Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nor at least consist of the same parts. First a circular or square court,\r\nAA, surrounded by cells, too small for residence, and evidently intended\r\nto contain images, though none were found _in situ_. In the centre of\r\neach stands a circular or square platform or altar, approached by steps.\r\nThe circular one at Jamalgiri is adorned with cross-legged,\r\nconventional, seated figures of Buddha, the square one at Takht-i-Bahi\r\nby two rows of pilasters one over the other.[206] Beyond this is an\r\noblong court, BB, called the pantheon, from the number of images, small\r\nmodels of topes, and votive offerings of all sorts, that are found in\r\nit. It, like the last court, is surrounded by niches for images. Beyond\r\nthis again the vihara or residence, CC, with the usual residential\r\ncells. At Takht-i-Bahi there is a square court, D, surrounded by a high\r\nwall with only one door leading into it. A corresponding court exists at\r\nJamalgiri; but so far detached that it could not be included in the\r\nwoodcut. It is called the cemetery, and probably not without reason, as\r\nTurner in his ‘Embassy to Thibet’[207] describes a similar enclosure at\r\nTeshoo Loomboo in which the bodies of the deceased monks were exposed to\r\nbe devoured by the birds, and what happened there in 1800 may very well\r\nhave been practised at Peshawur at a much earlier age.\r\n\r\nWhen we attempt to compare these plans with those of our rock-cut\r\nexamples in India, we at once perceive the difficulty of comparing\r\nstructural with rock-cut examples. The monastery or residential parts\r\nare the only ones readily recognised. The pantheon does not apparently\r\nexist at Ajunta, nor is anything analogous to it attached to other\r\nseries of caves, but a group of small rock-cut dagobas exists just\r\noutside the cave at Bhaja, and a much more extensive one at\r\nKenheri,[208] and similar groups may have existed elsewhere. Numbers of\r\nsmall models of topes and votive offerings are found in the\r\nneighbourhood of all Buddhist establishments, and were originally no\r\ndoubt deposited in some such place as this. The circular or square altar\r\nis, however, a feature quite new to us, and takes the place of the\r\ndagoba in all the rock-cut chaitya halls. From its having steps to\r\nascend to it, it seems as if it was intended either for a platform from\r\nwhich either a congregation could be addressed, or a prayer offered up\r\nto a deity. If, however, it was really a dagoba, as General Cunningham\r\nsupposes, that difficulty disappears, and on the whole I am inclined to\r\nbelieve he may be right in this decision.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable ornamental features that adorn this monastery\r\nis a series of bas-reliefs that adorn the front of the steps of the\r\nstairs leading from the so-called Pantheon to the circular court at\r\nJamalgiri. They are sixteen in number, and each is adorned with a\r\nbas-relief containing twenty, thirty, or forty figures according to the\r\nsubject.[209] Among these the Wessantara and Sama jatakas can easily be\r\nrecognised,[210] and so may others when carefully examined. Besides\r\nthese there are representations of the chase, processions, dancing, and\r\ndomestic scenes of various kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 94. Corinthian Capital from Jamalgiri. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 95. Corinthian Capital from Jamalgiri. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)[211]]\r\n\r\nIn fact such a series of sixteen bas-reliefs, one over another, is\r\nhardly known to exist anywhere else, but is here only an appropriate\r\npart of an exuberance of sculptural ornamentation hardly to be matched,\r\nas existing in so small a space, in any other building of its class.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of this monastery seems to have been of singular\r\nrichness. General Cunningham brought away a dozen of capitals of the\r\nCorinthian order, and others exist in the Lahore Museum. As will be seen\r\nfrom the last two illustrations (Nos. 94, 95), they are unmistakably\r\nclassical, but of a form to which it is not at first sight easy to\r\nassign a date. They are more Greek than Roman in the character of their\r\nfoliage, but more Roman than Greek in the form of their volutes and\r\ngeneral design. Perhaps it would be correct to say they are more\r\nByzantine than either, but, till we have detailed drawings and know more\r\nof their surroundings, it is difficult to give a positive opinion as to\r\ntheir age.\r\n\r\nNot one of these was found _in situ_, nor, apparently, one quite entire,\r\nso that their use or position is not at first sight apparent. Some of\r\nthem were square, and it is consequently not difficult to see they may\r\nhave formed the caps of the antæ on each side of the cells, and are so\r\nrepresented in General Cunningham’s plate (15). If this is so, the\r\ncircular ones must have been placed on short circular pillars, one on\r\neach side, forming a porch to the cells. One at least seems to have\r\nstood free--like a stambha--and, as the General represents it on plate\r\n48, may have carried a group of elephants on its head.\r\n\r\nAll these capitals were apparently originally richly gilt, and most of\r\nthem, as well as some of the best of the sculptures, show traces of\r\ngilding at the present day,[212] and, as others show traces of colour,\r\nthe effect of the whole must have been gorgeous in the extreme. From the\r\nanalogy of what we find in the contemporary caves at Ajunta and Bagh, as\r\nwell as elsewhere, there can be little doubt that fresco-painting was\r\nalso employed: but no gilding, as far as I know, has been found in\r\nIndia, nor indeed any analogue to the Corinthian capital. All the\r\ncapitals found in India are either such as grew out of the necessities\r\nof their own wooden construction, or were copied from bell-shaped forms\r\nwe are familiar with at Persepolis, where alone in Central Asia they\r\nseem to have been carried out in stone. There is little doubt, however,\r\nthat before the time of the Achæmenians the same forms were used in wood\r\nby the Assyrians;[213] and they may have been so employed down to the\r\ntime of Alexander, if not later. Certain it is, at all events, that this\r\nwas the earliest form we know of employed in lithic architecture in\r\nIndia, and the one that retained its footing there certainly till long\r\nafter the Christian Era, and also among the Gandhara sculptures probably\r\nto a very late date.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to restore, approximately, the front of the cells in\r\nthese monasteries, from the numerous representations of them found\r\namong the ruins, where they are used as conventional frames for\r\nsculptures. It probably was owing to the fact that their fronts may have\r\nbeen adorned with paintings representing scenes from the life of Buddha,\r\nor emblems of various sorts, that these miniature representations of\r\nthem were used to convey the same design in sculpture. The form of the\r\nwooden framework which filled the upper part of all the great windows of\r\nthe chaitya halls, from the earliest known examples, is also used for\r\nthe same purpose in these Gandhara monasteries. Few things among these\r\nsculptures are more common than these semicircular frames, filled with\r\nsculpture of the most varied design. They are in fact the counterparts\r\nof what would have been carried out in painted glass had they possessed\r\nsuch a material.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that it is hardly likely we shall now recover one of\r\nthese cells or chapels in so perfect a state as to feel sure of its form\r\nand ornamentation. It would, however, be an immense gain to our\r\nknowledge of the subject if one were found, for it is hardly safe to\r\ndepend on restorations made from conventional representations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there is one monument in India which--_mutatis\r\nmutandis_--reproduces them with considerable exactness. The small\r\ndetached rath at Mahavellipore is both in plan and dimensions, as well\r\nas in design, an almost exact reproduction of these Jamalgiri cells. Its\r\nlower front is entirely open, flanked by two detached pillars. Above\r\nthis are two roofs, with a narrow waist between them--somewhat\r\ndifferently arranged it must be confessed, but still extremely similar.\r\nIn the Jamalgiri representations of these cells everything is simplified\r\nto admit of the display of sculpture. At Mahavellipore all the\r\narchitectural features are retained, but they are still marvellously\r\nalike, so much so, that there seems no doubt this little rath (Woodcut\r\nNo. 181, p. 328), with its circular termination, is as exact a copy of\r\nwhat a Buddhist chaitya hall was at the time it was carved, as that the\r\ngreat rath (Woodcut No. 66) is a correct reproduction of a Buddhist\r\nvihara at the same period.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, these Gandhara sculptures and these raths represent the\r\nchaitya hall of the Buddhists in a much more complicated and elaborate\r\nform than we find it in the simple but majestic examples at Karli,\r\nNassick, or Ajunta. The Jamalgiri cells need not be so modern as the\r\nrath at Mahavellipore, but they are certainly approaching to it[214] as\r\nnearly in date as they are in form.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, General Cunningham has dug out a small vihara at Shah\r\nDehri, the ancient Taxila, which seems more ancient than these Peshawur\r\nmonasteries. As will be seen from the plan (Woodcut No. 96), it is not\r\nonly small in dimensions, but simple in its arrangements--as simple,\r\nindeed, as any of those at Cuttack or in the western Ghâts. Like them it\r\nhas a raised bench, not however divided into beds as there, but more\r\nlike a continuous seat. It no doubt, however, was used for both\r\npurposes. Its most remarkable peculiarity, however, is its Ionic order.\r\nAs will be seen, the bases of the pillars are of the usual form, and as\r\ncorrect as any that could be found in Greece or Rome, from before the\r\nChristian Era to the age of Constantine, and, though the capital is not\r\nfully made out, there can be little doubt what was intended (Woodcut No.\r\n97); twelve coins of Azes were found close by, from which it may be\r\ninferred the building was of his age, or belonging to the first century\r\nB.C.,[215] and there is nothing in the architecture to militate against\r\nthis idea. It seems the oldest thing yet found in this province.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 96. Plan of Ionic Monastery, Shah Dehri. (From a Plan by\r\nGeneral Cunningham.)

(From a Drawing by General\r\nCunningham.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary classical character and the beauty of the sculptures\r\nfound in these Gandhara monasteries is of such surpassing interest for\r\nthe history of Indian art, that it is of the utmost importance their age\r\nshould be determined, if it is possible to do so. At present, sufficient\r\nmaterials do not exist in this country to enable the general public to\r\nform even an opinion on any argument that may be brought forward on the\r\nsubject; nor will they be in a position to do so till the Government can\r\nbe induced to spend the trifling sum required to bring some of them\r\nhome. They are quite thrown away where they now are; here, they would\r\nhardly be surpassed in interest by any recent discoveries of the same\r\nclass. Pending this, the reader must be content with such a statement\r\nof the argument as may be put forward by those who have access to\r\nphotographs and such materials as are not available to the general\r\npublic.[216] It it is understood that General Cunningham intends to\r\npublish photographs of the 165 objects in his collection. When this is\r\ndone, it will supply the want to a certain extent, but a really correct\r\njudgment can only be formed on an actual inspection of the objects\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAmong Indian antiquaries there are two different views as to the age of\r\nthese sculptures, regarding either of which a great deal may be urged\r\nwith a considerable degree of plausibility. The first is, that the\r\nBactrian Greeks carried with them into Asia the principles of Grecian\r\nsculpture and the forms of Grecian architecture, and either during their\r\nsupremacy or after their expulsion from Bactria established a school of\r\nclassical art in the Peshawur valley. It further assumes that, when\r\nBuddhism was established there under Kanishka and his successors, it\r\nbloomed into that rich and varied development we find exhibited in these\r\nGandhara monasteries. This is the view adopted by General Cunningham,\r\nwho, however, admits that, as all the sculptures are Buddhist, the\r\nearliest must be limited to the age of Kanishka, which he assumes to be\r\nabout B.C. 40,[217] and that they extend to A.D. 100, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe other theory equally admits the presence of the classical element,\r\nderived from the previous existence of the Bactrian Greeks, but spreads\r\nthe development of the classical feeling through Buddhist art over the\r\nwhole period during which it existed in the valley, or from the 1st to\r\nthe 7th or 8th century of our era, and ascribes its peculiar forms as\r\nmuch, if not more, to constant communication with the West, from the age\r\nof Augustus to that of Justinian, rather than to the original seed\r\nplanted there by the Bactrians.\r\n\r\nConfining the argument as much as possible to the instances above\r\nquoted, either it is that these Corinthian capitals are a local\r\ndevelopment of forms the Greeks took with them to Bactria, or they were\r\nexecuted under Western influence when the classical orders had lost\r\ntheir original form, after the age of Constantine. We know perfectly the\r\nhistory of the Corinthian capitals in Italy, in Greece, and in Syria,\r\nbetween the ages of Augustus and Aurelian at all events (A.D. 270); and\r\nwe know that it requires a practised and well-educated eye to\r\ndistinguish between the capitals of the Pantheon of Agrippa and those\r\nlast executed at Baalbec or Palmyra. The entablatures show considerable\r\nprogress, but the capitals were so stereotyped that it is evident, if\r\nany Greek or Roman artists had designed capitals in Gandhara during the\r\nperiod just alluded to, we could predicate exactly what they would have\r\nbeen. After Constantine, however, the design of the capitals went wild,\r\nif the expression may be used. The practice of springing arches from\r\nthem, instead of their supporting horizontal architraves, required a\r\ntotal change, and in the West it produced exactly the same effects that\r\nwe find in Gandhara. The capitals, for instance, in the churches of St.\r\nDemetrius and that now known as the Eski Jouma at Salonica, both built\r\nin the early part of the 5th century, are almost identical in design\r\nwith these;[218] and many in the churches in Syria and Asia Minor[219]\r\nshow the same “abandon” of design, though frequently in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe presence of little cross-legged figures of Buddha among the foliage\r\nof the capitals is another sign of a comparatively modern age. The first\r\nprominent example of the practice, I believe, in classical art, seems to\r\nbe found in the Baths of Caracalla, at Rome (A.D. 312-330);[220] but it\r\ncertainly did not become common till long afterwards, and only general\r\nin what may be called mediæval art.[221] It is not, however, so much in\r\nthe presence of figures of Buddha on these capitals that I would insist\r\non as an indication of age, as on their presence in the monastery at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I believe it is correct to state that no statue of\r\nBuddha, in any of his conventional attitudes, has been found in India\r\nexecuted as early as the Christian Era. Those on the façade at Karli and\r\nin the western caves are avowedly insertions of the 4th or 5th centuries\r\nor later. There are none belonging to the eastern caves; nor any found\r\nat Buddh Gaya, Bharhut, or Sanchi; nor do I know of any one in India\r\nthat can be dated before A.D. 100. In these Gandhara monasteries they\r\nare very frequent, and of a type which in India would be assumed to be\r\ncertainly as late as the 4th or 5th century; some of them very much\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIt is true Buddhist books tell us frequently of statues of Buddha\r\nhaving been made at much earlier dates.[222] But Indian books have this\r\nfatal defect, that they represent facts and beliefs at the time they\r\nwere written, or acquired the forms in which we now find them, without\r\nmuch reference to contemporary authorities or facts at the time at which\r\nthey are supposed to have happened. Consequently, till we get some book\r\nthat assumed its present shape before A.D. 400,[223] their testimony is\r\nof very little avail in the controversy.\r\n\r\nBesides these figures of Buddha, there are a great number of figures\r\nwhich General Cunningham supposes represent kings. This can hardly be\r\nthe case, as they have all got nimbuses or glories at the back of their\r\nheads. All have the tika on their foreheads, as Buddha has, and none\r\nhave any kingly attributes, but all wear the same ornaments and amulets.\r\nThe first impression was, they may represent Bodhisatwas, or Buddhist\r\nsaints; but, as no similar figures occur anywhere in India, it is not\r\neasy to feel certain on this point. If I may be allowed to hazard a\r\nguess, I would suggest that they may represent the patriarchs who\r\npresided over the Church from the time of Amanda till it ceased to be a\r\nliving institution in India. Nagárjuna was one of the most important of\r\nthese, and, if this theory is correct, his statue will certainly be\r\nfound among the series; but this is, I fear, a point that must be left\r\nfor future investigation.[224] The misfortune is, that no inscribed\r\nstatue has yet been found in Gandhara, and, till it is, all\r\nidentification must be more or less guess-work or conjecture.\r\n\r\nA more important point than the mere presence of these conventional\r\nfigures of Buddha or of saints in these monasteries, is their excessive\r\nreduplication, which renders it probable that they are very much more\r\nmodern than is generally assumed.\r\n\r\nIn India, no building or cave is known with a date anterior to, say,\r\nA.D. 300 or 400, in which more than one such figure is represented.\r\nEven at Amravati they do not occur on the great rail which was erected\r\nin the beginning of the 4th century (_ante_, p. 100), but appear first\r\non the inner rail which was added a century afterwards: and they first\r\noccur in such caves as No. 19 and No. 26 at Ajunta, and in the later\r\ncaves in the island of Salsette, none of which seem to be earlier than\r\nA.D. 500, if so early.\r\n\r\nIn the Gandhara monasteries they exist literally in hundreds--on the\r\nbase of the altars or stupas, on the walls, and in the cells. The latter\r\nis, indeed, the most remarkable peculiarity of any. In no Buddhist\r\nmonument in India, so far as is known, have the monks been thrust out of\r\ntheir cells to make way for images. The practice is universal with the\r\nJains, and in the latest Buddhist monuments the cells are ignored; but\r\nhere we have what in all earlier Buddhist monuments would be cells\r\nsurrounding courts or halls, but all filled with images of Buddha or\r\nsaints. To such an extent is this carried, that if the plans of these\r\nmonasteries had been submitted to me, with merely a verbal or written\r\ndescription of their sculptures, I would unhesitatingly have pronounced\r\nthem to be Jaina temples of the 9th or 10th century. The sculptures, of\r\ncourse, negative any such adscription, but the similarity of their plans\r\nis most striking.\r\n\r\nConsiderable allowance must also be made for the fact that the Mahayana,\r\nor Greater Translation, introduced in the north of India by Nagárjuna,\r\nwas considerably in advance of the Hinayana school of Central India in\r\nall complications of ritual observances. Making, however, an allowance\r\nof one or even two centuries for this, it is difficult to believe that\r\nany of these monasteries yet brought to light are earlier than the 4th\r\nor 5th century.\r\n\r\nIf I am correct in assigning the outer casing of the Manikyala tope to\r\nthe beginning of the 8th century (_ante_, p. 83), there is certainly no\r\n_à priori_ improbability in this view. The pilasters that surround its\r\nbase are so similar to those represented in the bas-reliefs of the\r\nmonasteries[225] that they must belong nearly to the same age. Those of\r\nthe tope are less classical, it is true, than those of the bas-reliefs,\r\nand may, therefore, be more modern; but they cannot be very far apart.\r\n\r\nAll these statues of Buddha, or of Buddhist saints, in the Gandhara\r\nmonasteries, have a peculiarity which will interest the Christian\r\narchæologist. Without exception, they have a nimbus or circular disc\r\nbehind their heads. This does not occur at Sanchi in the 1st century of\r\nour era, nor, so far as is known, in any sculpture, on any rail, or in\r\nany cave, before it appears at Amravati on the great rail, in the 4th\r\ncentury of our era. Earlier examples may be found, but till they are,\r\nits presence militates against the idea that these sculptures can be so\r\nearly as the 1st century after Christ, and, with the other evidence,\r\nwould seem to indicate a much more modern date.\r\n\r\nOne other argument seems to bear directly on this point. From what has\r\nbeen said above (_ante_, p. 76), it appears that the erection of the\r\ntopes in Gandhara was spread pretty evenly over the whole time that\r\nelapsed from the Christian Era till Buddhism ceased to be the religion\r\nof the country, in the 7th or 8th century; and that the most flourishing\r\nperiod was about the year A.D. 400, when Fa Hian visited the country. It\r\nseems reasonable to suppose that the erection of the monasteries would\r\nfollow the same course, and that we might expect their greatest\r\ndevelopment to be simultaneous. To compress the monasteries and their\r\nsculptures within the limits of the first century after Christ would\r\nseem to violate all the probabilities of the case.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this local evidence, when we come to compare these\r\nsculptures with those of the western world, especially with those of\r\nsarcophagi or the ivories of the lower empire, it seems impossible not\r\nto be struck with the many points of resemblance they present. There are\r\nmany of the Gandhara bas-reliefs which, if transferred to the Lateran\r\nMuseum, and labelled as “Early Christian,” would pass muster with\r\nninety-nine people out of one hundred who visit that collection. There\r\nmay be one or two that might be described as belonging to as early an\r\nage as that of Hadrian, but generally they would seem of later date.\r\n\r\nAmong the ivories, those about the time of Constantine present about the\r\nsame jumble of the classical orders, the same reminiscence of classical\r\nart in the figure-sculpture, mixed up with the incongruities borrowed\r\nfrom extraneous sources which it is difficult to account for; but both\r\nin their perfections and their faults they seem so distinctly to belong\r\nto the same class of art that it is difficult to believe they do not\r\nbelong to the same age. The great difficulty here is to know what\r\nequation we ought to allow for distance in space which may have the same\r\neffect as time in producing apparent differences; but this hardly seems\r\nto have been of much importance here.\r\n\r\nAgainst all this may be urged the difficulty of understanding how such\r\ndirect and important influence could have been exercised by the\r\nByzantines in this remote province without its leaving any trace of its\r\nexistence on the arts of the Parthians or Sassanians, whose kingdom lay\r\nbetween, and without our having any written record of such intimate\r\nrelations. It is difficult, of course, but, if the facts are as stated\r\nabove, such negative inferences must make way before the positive\r\ntestimony of the sculptures themselves. Till within the last very few\r\nyears no one dreamt of classical art having any such influence at any\r\nage on the arts of Gandhara. That being established in contradiction of\r\nall previously conceived ideas, the time at which it took place ought to\r\nbe ascertainable with comparative facility; and, in so far as any\r\nwritten evidence is concerned, may have been as probably at or after the\r\ntime of Constantine, as at or after that of Augustus.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to extend this argument to any length; but without\r\nproducing the data on which it is based, or giving references to\r\ndrawings and photographs which have not been published, it would hardly\r\ncarry conviction to the minds of those who have not access to means of\r\ninformation not yet made public.[226] To avoid, therefore, being\r\ntedious, perhaps I may be allowed to state that, having given the best\r\nattention to the materials at my command, the conclusion I have arrived\r\nat is, that though some of these Gandhara sculptures probably are as\r\nearly as the 1st century of the Christian Era, the bulk of those at\r\nJamalgiri and more especially those at Takht-i-Bahi, are subsequent to\r\nthe 3rd and 4th, and that the series extends down to the 8th--till, in\r\nfact, the time when Buddhism was obliterated in these countries.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of some new fact, or of an inscription on a piece of\r\nsculpture either with a date or a king’s name that can be recognised,\r\nmay any day settle beyond dispute which of these views is the correct\r\none. Meanwhile, however, as the evidence at present stands, it seems\r\nhardly doubtful that the theory which assigns the more modern date to\r\nthese sculptures, is that which accords best with all that has hitherto\r\nbeen brought to light, or with the history of the Buddhist religion as\r\nat present known.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, it is evident that the term Græco-Bactrian, or\r\nGræco-Buddhist, which has been applied to these sculptures, is a\r\nmisnomer. The Bactrians may have sown the seeds of a classical style in\r\nthese parts, but the art we now find there would be more properly called\r\nIndo-Roman or Indo-Byzantine, and must have been nourished and kept up\r\nby constant communication between the East and the West during the\r\nperiod at which it was most flourishing, which may be described as that\r\nintervening between the age of Constantine and that of Justinian.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above regarding the sculptures of Bharhut and\r\nSanchi, it appears evident that the Indians had a school of art of their\r\nown before they knew anything of the arts of the western world; but that\r\nnative art seems to have had very little influence on the arts of\r\nGandhara. The western arts, on the contrary, acting through that\r\ncountry, seem to have had considerable influence on those of India at\r\nperiods subsequent to the Christian Era. It seems at least almost\r\nimpossible to escape the conviction that the arts of Amravati and the\r\nlater caves, say of the Gupta period, betray most marked evidence of\r\nWestern influence, and it seems that it is only through Gandhara that it\r\ncan have reached them.\r\n\r\nSo strongly marked is all this that it may become a subject of an\r\ninteresting investigation to inquire whether the Greeks were not the\r\nfirst who taught the Indians idolatry. There is no trace of images in\r\nthe Vedas or in the laws of Manu, or any of the older books or\r\ntraditions of the Hindus. As repeatedly mentioned, there is as little\r\ntrace of any image of Buddha or Buddhist figures being set up for\r\nworship before the Christian Era, or for a century after it. But the\r\nearliest, the finest, and the most essentially classical figures of\r\nBuddha are to be found in Gandhara, and, so far as we at present know,\r\nof an earlier date there than any found in India Proper.\r\n\r\nIf General Cunningham’s sculptures or the contents of the Lahore Museum\r\ncould only be made available to the learned in Europe, with the\r\nrequisite local information, they would, I fancy, at once supersede the\r\nmeagre and most unsatisfactory written details which have alone come\r\ndown to us, and would throw a flood of light on one of the most\r\ninteresting but most obscure chapters of the history of the commerce and\r\nof the early intercourse between the western and the eastern world.\r\n\r\nPending this being done, we already know enough to open our eyes to many\r\nthings that promise to result in the most interesting discoveries, and\r\nto teach us to cease to wonder at many things which hitherto appeared\r\ninexplicable. If, for instance, it is not true that the King of Taxila,\r\nin the first century, spoke good Greek, as Apollonius of Tyana would\r\npersuade us he did, we know at least that he practised Greek\r\narchitecture. If St. Thomas did not visit Gondophares, king of Gandhara,\r\nin the same century, many, at least, of his countrymen did, and there is\r\nno _à priori_ reason why he should not have done so also. If there are\r\ntraces of Christian doctrine in the ‘Bhagavat Gita,’ and of classical\r\nlearning in other poetic works of the Hindus, we now know at least where\r\nthey may have come from. In short, when we realise how strongly European\r\ninfluence prevailed in Gandhara in the first five or six centuries after\r\nChrist, and think how many thousands, it may be millions, crossed the\r\nIndus, going eastward during that period, and through that country, we\r\nought not to be surprised at any amount of Western thought or art we\r\nmay find in India. These, however, are problems that are only just\r\ndawning upon us, and which are certainly not yet ripe for solution,\r\nthough it may be most important they should be stated as early as\r\npossible, as it seems evident that the materials certainly exist from\r\nwhich an early answer may be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the question that bears most directly on the subject\r\nnow in hand is the inquiry, how far the undoubted classical influence\r\nshown in these Gandhara sculptures is due to the seed sown by the\r\nBactrian Greeks during the existence of their kingdom there, and how\r\nmuch to the direct influence of Rome and Byzantium between the times of\r\nAugustus and Justinian? Both, most probably, had a part in producing\r\nthis remarkable result; but, so far as we at present know, it seems that\r\nthe latter was very much more important than the former cause, and that\r\nin the first centuries of the Christian Era the civilisation of the West\r\nexercised an influence on the arts and religion of the inhabitants of\r\nthis part of India far greater than has hitherto been suspected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Feet of Buddha.

It alone, of all known countries, contains a\r\ncomplete series of Buddhist monuments extending from the time of Asoka\r\nto the present day, and in the ‘Mahawanso’ it alone possesses a history\r\nso detailed and so authentic, that the dates and purposes of the earlier\r\nbuildings can be ascertained with very tolerable precision. Besides its\r\nown intrinsic interest, if it were possible to compare this unbroken\r\nseries with its ascertained dates with the fragmentary groups on the\r\ncontinent of India, its parallelisms might throw much light on many\r\nquestions that are obscure and uncertain, and the whole acquire a\r\nconsistency that is now only too evidently wanting. Unfortunately, no\r\none has yet visited the island who was possessed of the necessary\r\nqualifications to supply the information necessary for these purposes.\r\nSir Emerson Tennent’s book, published in 1859, is still the best work on\r\nthe subject. He had, however, no special qualifications for the task,\r\nbeyond what were to be expected from any well-educated gentleman of\r\ntalent, and his description of the buildings[227] is only meant for\r\npopular reading.\r\n\r\nThe two papers by Captain Chapman, in the third volume of the\r\n‘Transactions,’ and thirteenth volume of the ‘Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ are still the best account of the ruins of Anuradhapura, and\r\nbeyond these a few occasional notices are nearly all the printed matter\r\nwe have to depend upon. Some seven or eight years ago, a series of\r\nphotographs, by the late Mr. Lawton, threw some light on the matter, and\r\nquite recently a second series by Captain Hogg, R.E., have added\r\nsomething to our knowledge. But photographs without plans or dimensions\r\nor descriptions are most deceptive guides, and, as none of these have\r\nbeen supplied, they add little to our scientific knowledge of the\r\nsubject. This is the more to be regretted, as quite recently some\r\nexcavations have been undertaken at Anuradhapura which are calculated to\r\nthrow considerable light on the structure of the great dagobas there,\r\nbut regarding which no information, except what is afforded by these\r\nphotographs, has reached this country.[228]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking peculiarities of Ceylonese art, as compared\r\nwith that of the continent, is the almost total absence of sculpture\r\nwhich it exhibits, and may be a peculiarity that may render it much less\r\nuseful for comparison than might at first sight appear. The most obvious\r\nsuggestion to meet this difficulty is to assume that the sculptures are\r\nburied in the accumulated ruins, in the cities where the great monuments\r\nare found, and will be discovered when excavations are made. It is to be\r\nfeared, however, that this theory is hardly tenable; Ceylon has never\r\nbeen occupied by Mahomedans, or other hostile races, and there is no\r\nreason to suppose that at any time statues would be thrown down, or\r\nbas-reliefs destroyed; besides this, such excavations as have been\r\nmade--and they are in the most likely places--have revealed nothing that\r\nwould lead us to hope for better results elsewhere. Perhaps this ought\r\nnot to surprise us, as nearly the same thing occurs in Burmah. In that\r\ncountry there is an unlimited amount of painting and carving, but no\r\nsculpture properly so called; and the same thing may have occurred in\r\nCeylon. So far as we can now see, all the great topes were covered with\r\nchunam, which may have been painted to any extent, and all the viharas,\r\nas in Burmah, were in wood, and consequently unfitted for permanent\r\nsculpture. Besides this, such information as we have would lead us to\r\nsuppose that painting was a more favoured art with the islanders than\r\nsculpture. When Fa Hian, for instance, visited the island in 412-413,\r\nhe describes an accompaniment to the procession of the tooth relic as\r\nfollows:--“The king next causes to be placed on both sides of the road\r\nrepresentations of the 500 bodily forms which Bôdisatwa assumed during\r\nhis successive births” (the jataka in fact). “These figures,” he adds,\r\n“are all beautifully painted in divers colours, and have a very\r\nlife-like appearance.”[229] It was not that they could not sculpture in\r\nstone, for, as we shall presently see, some of their carvings are of\r\ngreat delicacy and cleverness of execution, but they seem to have\r\npreferred colour to the more permanent forms of representation. If this\r\nis so, it certainly is remarkable, when we think of the wealth of\r\nsculpture exhibited by such monuments as Bharhut, Sanchi, or Amravati.\r\nIn so far as our present information goes, one single monastery in\r\nGandhara, such as Jamalgiri, for instance, possessed more sculpture than\r\nis to be found in the whole island of Ceylon. The form, too, of such\r\nsculptures as have been discovered, is almost as curious as its rarity.\r\nOnly one ancient figure of Buddha has yet been discovered at\r\nAnuradhapura. It may be of the 3rd or 4th century, and is placed\r\nunsymmetrically in a chapel in front of the Ruanwelli dagoba.\r\nEverywhere, however, there are statues of five or seven-headed serpents,\r\nor of men with serpent-hoods, which may be of any age, and at the foot\r\nof every important flight of steps there are two dwarpals or doorkeepers\r\nwith this strange appendage,[230] and attached to each flight of steps\r\nof all the larger and older dagobas are figures of the great Naga\r\nhimself. In fact, in so far as the testimony of the sculptures alone is\r\nconcerned, we would be forced to conclude that all the great monuments\r\nof the capital were devoted to Serpent worship instead of that of\r\nBuddha, with one exception, however; that one is dedicated to the\r\nBo-tree, which is supposed to be the tree originally sent by Asoka from\r\nBuddh Gaya more than 2000 years ago. We know, of course, that all this\r\nis not so, but it is a testimony to the early prevalence of Tree and\r\nSerpent worship in the island, as strange as it was unexpected.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the Ceylonese monuments is their situation in the\r\ntwo capitals of the island, for, it will have been observed, none of the\r\nremains of Buddhist architecture described in the previous chapters are\r\nfound in the great capital cities of the Empire. They are detached\r\nmonuments, spared by accident in some distant corner of the land, or\r\nrock-cut examples found in remote and secluded valleys. Buddhist\r\nPalibothra has entirely perished--so has Sravasti and Vaisali; and it is\r\nwith difficulty we can identify Kapilawastu, Kusinara, and other famous\r\ncities, whose magnificent monasteries and stupas are described by the\r\nChinese travellers in the fifth or seventh century of our era. In a\r\ngreat measure, this may be owing to their having been built of brick and\r\nwood; and, in that climate, vegetation is singularly destructive of the\r\nfirst, and insects and decay of the second. But much is also due to the\r\ncountry having been densely peopled ever since the expulsion of the\r\nBuddhists. It may also be remarked that the people inhabiting the plains\r\nof Bengal since the expulsion of the Buddhists, were either followers of\r\nthe Brahmanical or Mahomedan religions--both inimical to them, or, at\r\nleast, having no respect for their remains.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon the case is different. Though the great capitals were early\r\ndeserted, the people are now Buddhists, as they have been for the last\r\n2000 years, and there, consequently, cities are still found adorned with\r\nmonuments, which, though in ruins, convey a sufficient impression of\r\nwhat those of India must have been in the days of her glory.\r\n\r\nAnuradhapura seems to have become the capital of Ceylon about 400 years\r\nbefore Christ, or about a century and a half after the death of Buddha,\r\nand the fabled introduction of his religion into the island. It was not,\r\nhowever, till after the lapse of another 150 years that it became a\r\nsacred city, and one of the principal capitals of Buddhism in the East,\r\nwhich it continued to be till about the year 769, when, owing to the\r\nrepeated and destructive invasions of the Malabars, the capital was\r\nremoved to Pollonarua. That city reached its period of greatest\r\nprosperity and extension, apparently in the reign of Prakrama Bahu,\r\n1153-1186, and then sank during a long and disastrous period into decay.\r\nThe seat of government was afterwards moved hither and thither, till the\r\ncountry fell into the hands of the Portuguese and Dutch, and finally\r\nsuccumbed to our power.\r\n\r\n\r\nANURADHAPURA.\r\n\r\nThe city of Anuradhapura is now totally deserted in the midst of an\r\nalmost uninhabited jungle. Its public buildings must have suffered\r\nseverely from the circumstances under which it perished, exposed for\r\ncenturies to the attacks of foreign enemies. Besides this, the rank\r\nvegetation of Ceylon has been at work for 1000 years, stripping off all\r\ntraces of plaster ornaments, and splitting the masonry in many places.\r\n\r\nThe very desolation, however, of its situation has preserved these\r\nancient monuments from other and greater dangers. No bigoted Moslem has\r\npulled them down to build mosques and monuments of his own faith; no\r\nindolent Hindu has allowed their materials to be used for private\r\npurposes or appropriated as private plunder; and no English magistrate\r\nhas yet rendered them available for mending station roads and bridges.\r\nWe may be sure, therefore, that these ruins deserve the greatest\r\nattention from the student of Buddhist architecture, and that a vast\r\nfund of information may be drawn from them when sufficiently explored\r\nand described.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar fortune of Anuradhapura is that it continued the capital of\r\nCeylon for ten centuries; and, alone of all Buddhist cities, it retains\r\nsomething like a complete series of the remains of its greatness during\r\nthat period. We possess, moreover, in the ‘Mahawanso’ and other\r\nCeylonese scriptures, a tolerably authentic account of the building of\r\nall these monuments, and of the purposes to which they were dedicated.\r\nAmong the vestiges of its former grandeur still to be found, are the\r\nruins of seven dome-shaped topes or dagobas, of one monastery, of a\r\nbuilding erected to contain the sacred Bo-tree, and several other ruins\r\nand antiquities. Among these is the great mound called the tomb of the\r\nusurper Elaala, but more probably it is a tope erected by the king\r\nDuttagaimuni to commemorate the victory over that intruder which he\r\ngained on this spot about the year B.C. 161. As it is now a mere mound,\r\nwithout any distinguishable outline, it will not be again alluded to.\r\n\r\nTwo of the topes are of the largest size known: one, the Abhayagiri, was\r\nerected B.C. 88; its dome is exactly hemispherical, and described with a\r\nradius of 180 ft., being thus more than 1100 ft. in circumference, and\r\nwith the base and spire making up a total elevation of 244 ft., which is\r\nonly 16 ft. less than the traditional height of 120 cubits assigned to\r\nit in the ‘Mahawanso.’[231] It was erected by a king Walagambahu, to\r\ncommemorate his reconquest of his kingdom from a foreign usurper who had\r\ndeposed him and occupied his throne for about sixteen years.\r\n\r\nThe second tope is the Jetawana, erected by a king Mahasena A.D. 275. In\r\nform and dimensions it is almost identical with the last described,\r\nthough somewhat more perfect in outline, and a few feet higher, owing\r\nprobably to its being more modern than its rival. These two were\r\ncommemorative monuments, and not relic shrines.\r\n\r\nNext to these, but far more important from its sacredness, is the\r\nRuanwelli dagoba, erected by king Duttagaimuni, between the years 161\r\nand 137 B.C., over a very imposing collection of relics, of which a full\r\naccount is given in the 31st chapter of the ‘Mahawanso.’ Its dimensions\r\nare very similar to those of the two last described, but it has been so\r\nmuch defaced, partly by violence, and partly, it seems, from a failure\r\nof the foundations, that it is not easy to ascertain either its original\r\nshape or size. The same king erected another smaller tope, 260 ft. in\r\ndiameter. It is now known as the Mirisiwellya. Like the last described\r\nit is very much ruined, and not particularly interesting either from its\r\nform or history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 98. Elevation of front of Staircase, Ruanwelli Dagoba. No\r\nscale.]\r\n\r\nSome excavations that have recently been undertaken have disclosed the\r\nfact that the Ruanwelli dagoba had at its base three offsets, or\r\nprocession paths, rising like steps, one behind and above the other, but\r\nwith no ornament now apparent, except a plain Buddhist rail of two bars\r\non the outer edge of the two lower ones, and of an elephant cornice to\r\nthe upper. It can hardly, however, be doubted that the inner faces were\r\noriginally plastered, and painted with historical scenes. On each of the\r\nfour fronts of this dagoba was an ornamental projection containing and\r\npartially concealing the flights of steps by which access was had to\r\nthese galleries.[232] From the photographs, it is not clear where the\r\nsteps were that lead to the first, but those leading from the first to\r\nthe second and third were arranged like those at Sanchi (Woodcut No. 11)\r\nbehind this frontispiece. Without a plan, however, it is difficult to\r\nmake out exactly what the arrangement may have been.\r\n\r\nA precisely similar arrangement of stairs exists on the four faces of\r\nthe Abhayagiri and Jetawana dagobas, to that shown in the two Woodcuts\r\nNos. 98, 99, and consists first of a plain base, above which is a frieze\r\nof elephants’ heads with pateræ between them, very like those used in\r\nthe metopes of the Roman Doric order; above this are three plain faces\r\ndivided by ornamental string courses. Then a bracket cornice with pateræ\r\nagain, and above this two or three more cornices. Above this there was\r\nprobably a parapet simulating a Buddhist rail.\r\n\r\nAt each end of this projecting arrangement were two stelæ--at the\r\nRuanwelli the inner covered by a foliaged pattern, the outer by a\r\nseven-headed Naga, as will be observed in the Woodcut No. 99; at the\r\nAbhayagiri, the inner stele is adorned with a pattern so nearly\r\nidentical with that on the pillars of the western gateway at\r\nSanchi,[233] that we have no difficulty in recognising them as belonging\r\nto about the same age; though this one, of course, is the older of the\r\ntwo (B.C. 104). On the other stele in this tope (Woodcut No. 100), we\r\nrecognise the shield, the Swastica, the trisul, the conch (of Vishnu?)\r\nand all the other Buddhist emblems with which we are already familiar.\r\nThe Naga here has a stele of his own and detached from the other two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 99. View of Frontispiece of Stairs, Ruanwelli Dagoba.\r\n(From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAll this is architecturally so unlike anything we find of the same age\r\non the continent of India, while its sculptured details are so nearly\r\nidentical, that, when we come to know more about it, these differences\r\nand similarities may lead to most important inferences; but we must at\r\npresent wait for the requisite information to enable us to see the\r\nbearing of these peculiarities.\r\n\r\nBesides these four large buildings there are two smaller ones, known as\r\nthe Thuparamaya and Lankaramaya, very similar to one\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 100. Stelæ at the end of Stairs, Abhayagiri Dagoba. (From\r\na Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 101. Thuparamaya Tope. (From an unpublished Lithograph by\r\nthe late James Prinsep.)]\r\n\r\nanother in size and arrangement. The first-named is represented in\r\nWoodcut No. 101. The tope itself, though small and somewhat ruined, is\r\nof a singularly elegant bell-shaped outline.[234] Its diameter and\r\nheight are nearly the same, between 50 ft. and 60 ft., and it stands on\r\na platform raised about 9 ft. from the ground, on which are arranged\r\nthree rows of pillars, which form by far the most important\r\narchitectural ornament of the building. The inner circle stands about 2\r\nft. from the dagoba, and the other two about 10 ft. from each other. The\r\npillars themselves are monoliths 26 ft. in height, of which the lower\r\npart, to the height of 9 ft., is left square, each side being about 1\r\nft. The next division, 14 ft. 6 in. in length, has the angles cut off,\r\nas is usual in this style, so as to form an octagon; the two parts being\r\nof one piece of granite. These sustain a capital of the same material, 2\r\nft. 6 in. in height.\r\n\r\nAccounts differ as to the number of the pillars, as Mr. Knighton says\r\nthey were originally 108;[235] whereas Captain Chapman counted 149, and\r\nstates the original number to have been 184.[236]\r\n\r\nThis relic-shrine was erected by the celebrated king Devenampiatissa,\r\nabout 250 years B.C., to contain the right jawbone of Buddha, which--say\r\nthe Buddhist chroniclers--descending from the skies, placed itself on\r\nthe crown of the monarch. As contemporary with Asoka it belongs to the\r\nmost interesting period of Buddhist history, and is older, or, at least,\r\nas old, as anything now existing on the continent of India; and there is\r\nevery reason to suppose it now exists, as nearly as may be, in the form\r\nin which it was originally designed, having escaped alteration,[237]\r\nand, what is more unusual in a Buddhist relic-shrine, having escaped\r\naugmentation. When the celebrated tooth relic was brought hither from\r\nIndia at the beginning of the 4th century, it was deposited in a small\r\nbuilding erected for the purpose on one of the angles of the platform of\r\nthis building, instead of being placed, as seems generally to have been\r\nthe case, in a shrine on its summit, and eventually made the centre of a\r\nnew and more extended erection. Perhaps it was an unwillingness to\r\ndisturb the sacred circle of pillars that prevented this being done, or\r\nit may have been that the tooth relic, for some reason we do not now\r\nunderstand, was destined never to be permanently hid from the sight of\r\nits adorers. It is certain that it has been accessible during the last\r\n2000 years, and is the only relic of its class that seems to have been\r\nsimilarly preserved and exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe Lankaramaya (Woodcut No. 102) is extremely similar to the\r\nlast--though considerably more modern, having been erected A.D.\r\n221--and looks of even more recent date than it really is, in\r\nconsequence of a thorough repair some time ago, which has nearly\r\nobliterated its more ancient features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 102. Lankaramaya Dagoba, A.D. 221. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAs will be observed the two last-mentioned dagobas present us with a\r\npeculiarity not found on any example we have yet met with, inasmuch as\r\nthey are surrounded by three circles of slender monolithic columns, of\r\nvery elegant design. It can hardly be doubted that these represent, and\r\ntake the place of, the rail of the northern topes, and subserve the same\r\npurpose, but in what manner is not at first sight very apparent.\r\nReferring, however, to what was said above, about the Ceylonese\r\npreferring painting to sculpture, it does not seem difficult to explain\r\nthe anomaly. These pillars were originally, I fancy, connected with one\r\nanother by beams of wood on their capitals, and from these, frames or\r\ncurtains may have been suspended covered with the paintings which are so\r\nindispensable a part of Buddhist decoration. But it may be objected why\r\nthree? or, as I believe, the Lankaramaya had originally, four such\r\nranges of pillars? It is true the northern dagobas had generally only\r\none rail, but that at Amravati had two, and as the great dagobas here\r\nhad three procession-paths, while none of the northern ones had more\r\nthan one, we should not be surprised if the smaller dagobas had three\r\npaths also, though differently arranged, and even then hardly capable of\r\ndisplaying the same amount of painting. When we come to describe the\r\ngreat temple of Boro Buddor in Java it will be seen that it had five\r\nprocession-paths, and that their walls were sculptured, both inside and\r\noutside, with an amount of stone decoration which none of these\r\nCeylonese topes could display, even in painting, by any arrangement we\r\ncan now understand.\r\n\r\nThere is still another--the Saila dagoba--within the limits of the city,\r\nbut so ruined that its architectural features are undistinguishable,\r\nthough tradition would lead us to suppose it was the oldest in the\r\nplace, belonging to a period even anterior to Sakya Muni. The spot at\r\nall events is said to have been hallowed by the presence of Kasyapa, the\r\npreceding Buddha.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are on the hill of Mehentele, a few miles to the\r\nnorth-east of the city, two important relic-shrines: one of the first\r\nclass, erected on its summit to cover a hair that grew on the forehead\r\nof Buddha over his left eyebrow. The other, on a shoulder of the hill\r\nimmediately below this, is of the same class as the Thuparamaya; a small\r\ncentral building surrounded by concentric rows of granite pillars,\r\nwhich, as appears to have been usual when this mode of decoration was\r\nemployed, rose to half the height of the central mound.\r\n\r\nThere are, in addition to these, a great number of topes of various\r\nsorts scattered over the plain, but whether any of them are particularly\r\ninteresting, either from their architecture or their history, has not\r\nbeen ascertained, nor will it be till the place is far more carefully\r\nsurveyed than it has yet been.\r\n\r\nThere is another ruin at Anuradhapura, which, if a little more perfect,\r\nwould be even more interesting than those topes. It goes by the name of\r\nthe Lowa Maha Paya, or Great Brazen Monastery. We have a full account in\r\nthe ‘Mahawanso’ of its erection by the pious king Duttagaimuni (B.C.\r\n161),[238] according to a plan procured from heaven for the purpose--as\r\nwell as a history of its subsequent destruction and rebuildings.\r\n\r\nWhen first erected it is said to have been 100 cubits or 225 ft. square,\r\nand as high as it was broad; the height was divided into nine storeys,\r\neach containing 100 cells for priests, besides halls and other\r\nindispensable apartments. Nearly 200 years after its erection (A.D. 30)\r\nit required considerable repairs, but the first great disaster occurred\r\nin the reign of Mahasena, A.D. 285, who is said to have destroyed it\r\nutterly.[239] It was re-erected by his son, but with only five storeys\r\ninstead of nine; and it never after this regained its pristine\r\nmagnificence, but gradually fell into decay even before the seat of\r\ngovernment was removed to Pollonarua. Since that time it has been\r\ncompletely deserted, and all that now remains are the 1600 pillars which\r\nonce supported it. These generally consist of unhewn blocks of granite\r\nabout 12 ft. high; some of the central ones are sculptured, and many\r\nhave been split into two, apparently at the time of the great rebuilding\r\nafter its destruction by Mahasena; as it is, they stand about 6 ft.\r\napart from centre to centre in a compact phalanx, forty on each face,\r\nand covering a space of 250 ft. or 260 ft. each way. Upon the pillars\r\nmust have been placed a strong wooden framing from which the remaining\r\neight storeys rose, as in the modern Burmese monasteries, in a manner to\r\nbe explained in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nThere is only one difficulty, so far as I can see, in understanding the\r\narrangement of the superstructure of this building, and that is the\r\nassertion of the ‘Mahawanso’ that it consisted of nine\r\nstoreys--afterwards of five--each containing 100 apartments. For myself\r\nI have no hesitation in rejecting this statement as impossible, not only\r\nfrom the difficulty of constructing and roofing such a building, but\r\nbecause its form is so utterly opposed to all the traditions of Eastern\r\nart. If we turn back to Fa Hian or Hiouen Thsang’s description of the\r\ngreat Dekhani monastery (page 135) or to the great rath at Mahavellipore\r\n(Woodcut No. 66), or, indeed, to any of the 1001 temples of southern\r\nIndia, all of which simulate three, five, or nine-storeyed residences,\r\nwe get a distinct idea of what such a building may have been if erected\r\nin the Indian style. It would, too, be convenient and appropriate to the\r\nclimate, each storey having its terrace for walking or sleeping in the\r\nopen air, and the whole easily constructed and kept in order. All this\r\nwill be clearer in the sequel, but in the meanwhile it hardly appears\r\ndoubtful that the Lowa Maha Paya was originally of nine, and\r\nsubsequently of five storeys, each less in dimension than the one below\r\nit. The top one was surmounted as at Mahavellipore by a dome, but in\r\nthis instance composed of brass--whence its name; and, gilt and\r\nornamented as it no doubt was, it must have been one of the most\r\nsplendid buildings of the East. It was as high as the topes, and, though\r\nnot covering quite so much ground, was equal, in cubical contents, to\r\nthe largest of our English cathedrals, and the body of the building was\r\nhigher than any of them, omitting of course the spires, which are mere\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides these there are scattered about the ruins of Anuradhapura some\r\nhalf dozen, it may be a dozen, groups of pillars, whose use and purpose\r\nit would be extremely interesting to know something about. They all seem\r\nraised on a platform or stylobate, and approached by one or more flights\r\nof steps, of a highly ornamental character. One of these, leading to a\r\ngroup of pillars attached to the Ruanwelli dagoba, will convey some idea\r\nof their general character (Woodcut No. 103). At the foot of the flight\r\nof steps is a semicircular stone, popularly known in Ceylon as a moon\r\nstone (Woodcut No. 104). At least a dozen of these are known to exist at\r\nAnuradhapura and as many probably at Pollonarua. Some are large and some\r\nsmaller than others, but they\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 103. Pavilion with Steps at Anuradhapura. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 104. Moon Stone at Foot of Steps leading to the Platform\r\nof the Bo-tree, Anuradhapura. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nare all nearly identical in design and quite peculiar to Ceylon--nothing\r\nof the sort having yet been found on the continent of India or\r\nelsewhere. Inside an outer ornamental ring is a procession of animals,\r\ndivided from the next compartment by a richly elaborated scroll; within\r\nthat again a row of birds bearing lotus buds, and then a lotus flower\r\nwith a disc ornamented with circles. The animals are always elephants,\r\nlions, horses, and bulls, the birds either hansas, or sacred geese, or\r\nit may be pigeons. These, it will be recollected, are the animals which\r\nFa Hian and Hiouen Thsang describe as ornamenting the five storeys of\r\nthe great Dekhani monastery, and which, as we shall afterwards see, were\r\nalso arranged at Hullabîd in the 13th century in precisely the same\r\nmanner. For 1500 years they, and they only, seem to have been selected\r\nfor architectural purposes, but why this was so we are yet unable to\r\nexplain.[240]\r\n\r\nThe risers of these stairs, though not adorned with storeyed\r\nbas-reliefs, like those of the Jamalgiri monastery in Gandhara, are all\r\nrichly ornamented, being divided generally into two panels by figures of\r\ndwarfs and framed by foliaged borders, while the jambs or flanking\r\nstones are also adorned by either figures of animals or bas-reliefs.\r\n\r\nIf we had plans or any architectural details of the pavilions to which\r\nthese steps led, it probably would be easy to say to what purpose they\r\nwere dedicated and how they were roofed. The photographs do not enable\r\nus to do either, but from them we gather that some of these halls were\r\ncertainly enclosed by walls, as the outer side of the pillars is left\r\nrough and unsculptured, while those in the centre are sculptured all\r\nround. Meanwhile my impression is that they are the buildings Fa Hian\r\ndescribes as preaching halls--the chaitya or ceremonial halls attached\r\nto the great dagobas. In India the form these take is that of halls with\r\nsimulated dagobas inside them, towards which the worship was addressed,\r\nbut when a real dagoba existed 200 ft. to 400 ft. in diameter, what was\r\nwanted was a hall in which the priests could assemble to chant their\r\nliturgies, and from which to address their prayers to the great object\r\nof their reverence. If this were so, the axis of these halls ought to be\r\nturned towards the dagobas, but whether this was so or not is not yet\r\nascertained.[241]\r\n\r\nBesides these there is at Anuradhapura a temple called Isurumuniya,\r\npartly cut in the rock, partly structural, regarding which some\r\ninformation would be extremely interesting. Till within the last few\r\nyears the pillars of its porch still carried the wooden beams of a roof,\r\nbut whether it was the original one or a subsequent addition is by no\r\nmeans clear. From the mortises in the face of the rock I would be\r\ninclined to believe that it was at least in the original form, but the\r\nbuilding has been so knocked about and altered in modern times, that it\r\nis impossible to speak with certainty regarding it. So far as can be\r\njudged from such photographs as have come home, I would be inclined to\r\nascribe the original excavation to the 6th or 7th century. The\r\narchitecture of the steps and the Naga dwarpals are all of the old\r\npattern, but coarser and showing unmistakable signs of decadence.\r\n\r\nTo us these are the most interesting of the remains of the ancient city,\r\nbut to a Buddhist the greatest and most sacred of the vestiges of the\r\npast is the celebrated Bo-tree. This is now reverenced and worshipped\r\neven amidst the desolation in which it stands, and has been worshipped\r\non this spot for more than 2000 years; and thus, if not the oldest, is\r\ncertainly among the most ancient of the idols that still command the\r\nadoration of mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen Asoka sent his son Mahindo, and his daughter Sangamitta, to\r\nintroduce Buddhism into Ceylon, one of the most precious things which\r\nthey brought was a branch of the celebrated tree which still grows at\r\nGaya[242] (Woodcut No. 16). The branch, so says the legend,\r\nspontaneously severed itself from the parent stem, and planted itself in\r\na golden vase prepared for its reception. According to the prophecy, it\r\nwas to be “always green, never growing nor decaying,” and certainly\r\npresent appearances would go far to confirm such an assertion, for,\r\nnotwithstanding its age, it is small, and, though healthy, does not seem\r\nto increase. Its being evergreen is only a characteristic of its\r\nspecies, the _Ficus religiosa_; our acquaintance with it, however, must\r\nextend over a longer series of years than it yet does, before we can\r\nspeak with certainty as to its stationary qualities.\r\n\r\nIt grows from the top of a small pyramid, which rises in three terraces,\r\neach about 12 ft. in height, in the centre of a large square enclosure\r\ncalled the Maha Vihara. But though the place is large, sacred, and\r\nadorned with gates of some pretension, none of the architectural\r\nfeatures which at present surround it are such as to require notice in a\r\nwork like the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLONARUA.[243]\r\n\r\nAlthough very much more modern in date, and consequently less pure in\r\nstyle, the ruins at Pollonarua are scarcely less interesting than those\r\nof the northern capital to which it succeeded. They form a link between\r\nthe ancient and modern styles at a time when the Buddhists had ceased to\r\nexist, or at least to build, on the continent of India, and, when\r\nproperly illustrated, will enable us to speak with confidence of much\r\nthat we find beyond the Ganges. Almost all we know at present of these\r\nruins is due to the publications of Sir Emerson Tennent,[244] which,\r\nthough most valuable contributions, are far from exhausting the subject.\r\nAccording to this authority, the principal ruins extend in a line nearly\r\nnorth and south for about a mile and a half from the palace to the Gal\r\nVihara, and comprise two dagobas, besides a number of smaller edifices.\r\nThe greater part seem to have been erected during the reign of Prakrama\r\nBahu, 1153-86, though, as the city became the capital of the kingdom in\r\nthe 8th century, it is probable that an intelligent search would reveal\r\nsome of earlier date; while, as it was not deserted till 1235, some of\r\nthem may also be more modern.\r\n\r\nIf not the oldest, certainly the most interesting group at Pollonarua is\r\nthat of the rock-cut sculptures known as the Gal Vihara. They are not\r\nrock-cut temples in the sense in which the term is understood in India,\r\nbeing neither residences nor chaitya halls. On the left, on the face of\r\nthe rock, is a figure of Buddha, seated in the usual cross-legged\r\nconventional attitude, 16 ft. in height, and backed by a throne of\r\nexceeding richness: perhaps the most elaborate specimen of its class\r\nknown to exist anywhere. Next to this is a cell, with two pillars in\r\nfront, on the back wall of which is another seated figure of Buddha, but\r\ncertainly of a more modern aspect than that last described; that\r\nappearance may, however, be owing to whitewash and paint, which have\r\nbeen most liberally applied to it. Beyond this is a figure of Buddha,\r\nstanding in the open air; and still further to the right another of him,\r\nlying down in the conventional attitude of his attaining Nirvana. This\r\nfigure is 45 ft. long, while the standing one is only 25 ft. high.[245]\r\nThese Nirvana figures are rare in India, but there is one in the most\r\nmodern cave at Ajunta, No. 26, and others in the latest caves at Nassick\r\nand Salsette. None of these, however, so far as I know, ever attained in\r\nIndia such dimensions as these. In another century or two they might\r\nhave done so, but the attainment of such colossal proportions is a sure\r\nsign of their being very modern.\r\n\r\nIn front of the Gal Vihara stands the principal religious group of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 105. The Jayta Wana Rama--Ruins of Pollonarua. (From\r\nTennent’s ‘Christianity in Ceylon.’)]\r\n\r\nthe city, consisting first of the Jayta Wana Rama Temple, 170 ft. long\r\nby 70 ft. wide (Woodcut No. 105), containing an erect statue of Buddha\r\n58 ft. in height. On one side of it is the Kiri dagoba--on the right of\r\nthe woodcut--with two smaller topes, standing on raised platforms, the\r\nwhole space measuring 577 ft. by 500 ft., and was apparently at one time\r\nentirely filled with objects of religious adoration. The whole\r\ncertainly belongs to the age of Prakrama-Bahu. It was, however, built of\r\nbrick, and plastered, which gives it an appearance of inferiority even\r\nbeyond what is due to the inferior style of that age.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to this is the Rankot Dagoba, 180 ft. in diameter.\r\nThis, though only half that of some of those in the older capital, is\r\nstill larger than any known to exist on the continent of India. Its base\r\nis surrounded, like those in Burmah, by a number of small shrines, which\r\nat this age supplied the place of the pillars or of the rails which\r\nformed so important a part of the structure of the older examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 106. Sat Mehal Prasada. (From Sir J. E. Tennent’s\r\n‘Ceylon.’)]\r\n\r\nAt some distance from this, and near the palace, stands the Sat Mehal\r\nPrasada (Woodcut No. 106), which is one of the most interesting\r\nbuildings of the place, as it is one of the most perfect representations\r\nexisting of the seven-storeyed temples of Assyria already described,\r\nvol. i. page 152, _et seqq._ That this is a lineal descendant of the\r\nBirs Nimroud can hardly be doubted. It is also interesting as affording\r\na hint as to the appearance of the five or nine-storeyed monasteries\r\nmentioned in a previous page (196). This one, however, never was a\r\nresidence, nor does it simulate one, like the raths at Mahavellipore or\r\nother buildings in the Dravidian style, which will be described in a\r\nsubsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nIn front of it lies a splendid dolmen, or stone table, 26 ft. long, 4\r\nft. broad, and 2 ft. thick. It would be interesting to know if the\r\ndolmen rests on the ground, or is supported on three or more upright\r\nstones--most probably the latter. Like most of the Indian examples, it\r\nappears to be a squared and carved repetition of what in Europe we find\r\nonly rough and unhewn. The carving on its border represents a number of\r\nhansas or sacred geese--always a favourite subject of the Buddhist\r\nsculptors.[246] At one end of this stone is engraved a representation of\r\nSri, with her two elephants with their water-pots (Woodcut No. 2); and I\r\nfancy I can detect her also in other photographs elsewhere in Ceylon,\r\nbut not so distinctly as to feel sure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 107. Round House, called Watté Dajê, in Pollonarua. (From\r\nSir J. E. Tennent.)]\r\n\r\nClose to the Sat Mehal is a circular building, which, so far as is at\r\npresent known, is unique. It may almost be described as a hollow dagoba,\r\nbeing a circular enclosure surrounded by a wall, but empty in the\r\ncentre, at least containing nothing now. Originally, it may have had a\r\nshrine in its centre, or tabernacle of some sort, containing a relic or,\r\nmore probably, a sacred Tree. It is surrounded by a procession-path,\r\nenclosed by a highly-ornamental screen, and beyond this by a second\r\ngallery adorned with a range of slender pillars, like those which\r\nsurround the dagobas at Anuradhapura (Woodcut No. 107); below this,\r\nagain, is a richly-carved stylobate.\r\n\r\nFour flights of steps lead up to its procession-paths, more magnificent\r\nand elaborate than any others that have yet been discovered in Ceylon.\r\nThey all have most elaborate moon stones to start from. Their risers are\r\neach adorned with twelve figures of dwarfs, and their side-pieces, or\r\njambs, are also of exceptional richness, and each has a pair of\r\nNaga-headed dwarpals on each side of its upper flight. The photographs\r\nare sufficient to show that this is one of the most interesting\r\nbuildings in Ceylon, as well as one of the richest in sculptural\r\ndecorations; but unless the antiquities of Java throw some light on the\r\nsubject, we must be content with ignorant admiration till some one\r\ncapable of investigating its history visits the place.[247]\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are in Pollonarua several of those groups of\r\npillars, without roofs or walls, which we tried to describe in speaking\r\nof Anuradhapura. One, called the Audience Hall, seems to be very similar\r\nto those of the northern capital; another, known as the Hetti Vihara, is\r\nmore extensive, and may really be the foundation of a vihara; but till\r\nwe have plans and more details it is needless speculating on what they\r\nmay or may not have been.\r\n\r\nAlthough built in brick, and very much ruined, there still exist in\r\nPollonarua a palace and a vihara--the Abhayagiri--which was really a\r\nresidence, and whose examination would, no doubt, throw considerable\r\nlight on the arrangement of similar buildings in India. That information\r\nmight, however, be difficult to obtain, and, till the simpler and more\r\nmonumental buildings are examined and drawn, its investigation may well\r\nbe postponed.\r\n\r\nBesides these, Pollonarua possesses another point of interest of\r\nconsiderable importance, though hardly germane to our present subject.\r\nAmong its ruins are several buildings in the Dravidian style of\r\narchitecture, whose dates could easily, I fancy, be at least\r\napproximately ascertained. One of these is called the Dalada Maligawa,\r\napparently from its possessing at one time the tooth relic; for it is\r\nhardly probable that when migrating southward for fear of the Tamils\r\nthey would have left their cherished palladium behind them. If it was\r\nsheltered here, and this was the first building erected to receive it,\r\nit would be a most important landmark in the very vague chronology of\r\nthat style. Another, though called the Vishnu Deyanne Dewala, was\r\ncertainly either originally, or is now, dedicated to the worship of\r\nSiva, as is testified by the presence of the bull alongside of it, and\r\nalso apparently on its roof. But be this as it may, it is the lowest and\r\nflattest of those buildings I have yet met with, and more like a direct\r\nliteral copy from a constructive vihara than even the raths at\r\nMahavellipore (Woodcut No. 181). This may arise either from its being a\r\ncopy of an actual vihara existing at the time it was built, or to its\r\nbeing very old. Those at Mahavellipore, even if older than this one,\r\nmay have gone through certain stages towards their present conventional\r\nforms before they were cut in the rock. But more of this hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate for the history of architecture in Ceylon that the\r\noldest and finest of her rock-cut temples--as those, for instance, at\r\nDambul and Dunumadala Kanda--are only natural caverns, slightly improved\r\nby art; and those mentioned above, as the Isurumuniya at Anuradhapura,\r\nand Gal Vihara at Pollonarua, besides being comparatively modern, have\r\nvery little architecture about them, and that little by no means of a\r\ngood class. Generally speaking, what architecture these Ceylonese caves\r\ndo possess is developed on applied façades of masonry, never of the same\r\nage as the caves themselves, and generally more remarkable for\r\ngrotesqueness than beauty. Besides, the form of these caves being\r\naccidental, they want that interest which attaches so strongly to those\r\nof India, as illustrating the religious forms and ceremonies of the\r\nearly Buddhists. Indeed, their only point of interest seems to consist\r\nin their being still used for the celebration of the same rites to which\r\nthey were originally dedicated 2000 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above sketch cannot pretend to be anything like a complete\r\nand exhaustive treatise on the subject, it may probably be accepted, as\r\nfar as it goes, as a fairly correct and intelligible description of\r\nBuddhist architecture in India. We certainly know the beginning of the\r\nstyle, and as certainly its end. The succession of the buildings hardly\r\nadmits of doubt, and their dates are generally ascertained within very\r\nnarrow limits of error. A great deal more must, of course, be done\r\nbefore all the examples are known and all the _lacunæ_ filled up; but\r\nthis is being rapidly done, and in a few years from this time all that\r\nis necessary to complete the history may be available for the purpose.\r\nIt is hardly probable, however, that anything will be now discovered in\r\nIndia which will materially alter the views put forward in the preceding\r\npages. Another discovery like General Cunningham’s at Bharhut may reward\r\nthe industry of explorers; but even that, though it has given breadth\r\nand precision to our inquiries, and added so much to our stores of\r\nknowledge, has altered little that was known before. What was written in\r\nmy work on ‘Tree and Serpent Worship’ before the discovery was made,\r\nhas, in almost every instance, been confirmed, and in no important\r\nparticular modified or changed; and our knowledge is now so extended, it\r\nprobably will be the same in other cases. It is difficult, however, to\r\nform an opinion on the chances of any such discoveries being now made.\r\nThe one important building we miss of which accounts have reached us, is\r\nthe rock-cut monastery described by the Chinese Pilgrims (_ante_, p.\r\n135). If it was rock-cut, it almost certainly exists, and may yet be\r\nfound in some of the unexplored parts of the Nizam’s territory. If it is\r\ndiscovered, it will throw more light on Buddhist architecture in the\r\nfirst century of our era than anything yet brought to light. That it did\r\nexist seems hardly doubtful, inasmuch as we have in the great rath at\r\nMahavellipore (Woodcut No. 66) a literal copy of it--on a small scale,\r\nit is true--but so perfect that it certainly is not a first attempt to\r\nrepeat, in a monolithic form, a class of building that must have been\r\nvery common at the time this was attempted.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, even such a sketch as that contained in the preceding\r\npages is sufficient to prove that it is almost impossible to overrate\r\nthe importance of architecture and its associated arts in elucidating\r\nand giving precision to our knowledge of Buddhist history and mythology,\r\nfrom the time when it became the religion of the state till it perished\r\nin so far as India was concerned. In the rails at Buddh Gaya and\r\nBharhut, with the eastern caves, we have a complete picture of Buddhism\r\nas it existed during the great Mauryan dynasty (B.C. 325 to B.C. 188).\r\nAt Sanchi and the western caves we have as complete a representation of\r\nthe form it took from the first century before our era to the third or\r\nfourth after it. At Amravati, and from the Gandhara monasteries, we\r\nlearn what modifications had been introduced before and during the 4th\r\ncentury; and from the Ajunta and later caves we trace its history\r\ndownward through its period of decay till it became first almost Jaina\r\nand then faded away altogether.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of this thousand years we have no contemporary\r\nrecords except those written in stone, and during the latter we have no\r\nbooks we can depend upon; but the architecture, with its sculptures and\r\npaintings, remain, and bear the indelible impress of the thoughts, the\r\nfeelings, and the aspirations of those who executed them, and supply us\r\nwith a vast amount of exact knowledge on the subject which is not\r\nattainable by any other means now known to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nJAINA ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few of the problems connected with this branch of our subject\r\nso obscure and so puzzling as those connected with the early history of\r\nthe Architecture of the Jains. When we first practically meet with it in\r\nthe early part of the 11th century at Abu, or at Girnar, it is a style\r\ncomplete and perfect in all its parts, evidently the result of long\r\nexperience and continuous artistic development. From that point it\r\nprogresses during one or two centuries towards greater richness, but in\r\ndoing so loses the purity and perfection it had attained at the earlier\r\nperiod, and from that culminating point its downward progress can be\r\ntraced through abundant examples to the present day. When, however, we\r\ntry to trace its upward progress the case is widely different. General\r\nCunningham has recently found some Jaina statues at Muttra, with dates\r\nupon them apparently of 99 and 177 A.D.[248] If this is so, it is the\r\nearliest material trace of Jainism that has yet been discovered, and\r\nthey must have been associated with buildings which may yet reward the\r\nexplorer. From this time forward, till the 11th century, we have only\r\nfragments of temples of uncertain origin and date, and all in so very\r\nruined a condition that they hardly assist us in our researches. Yet we\r\ncannot doubt that the Jains did exist in India, and did build temples,\r\nduring the whole of this interval, and the discovery of some of them may\r\nyet reward the industry of some future investigator.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one thing seems tolerably clear, that the religions of the\r\nBuddhists and that of the Jains were so similar to one another both in\r\ntheir origin, and their development and doctrines, that their\r\narchitecture must also at one time have been nearly the same. In\r\nconsequence of this, if we could trace back Jaina art from about the\r\nyear 1000, when practically we first meet it, to the year 600 or 700,\r\nwhen we lose sight of Buddhist art, we should probably find the two very\r\nmuch alike. Or if, on the other hand, we could trace Buddhist art from\r\nA.D. 600 to A.D. 1000, we should as probably find it developing itself\r\ninto something very like the temples on Mount Abu, and elsewhere, at\r\nthat period of time.\r\n\r\nA strong presumption that the architecture of the two sects was similar\r\narises from the fact of their sculptures being so nearly identical that\r\nit is not always easy to distinguish what belongs to the one and what to\r\nthe other; and in all instances it requires some experience to do this\r\nreadily. The Tirthankars are generally represented seated in the same\r\ncross-legged attitude as Buddha, with the same curly hair, and the same\r\nstolid contemplative expression of countenance. Where, however, the\r\nemblems that accompany the Jaina saints can be recognised, this\r\ndifficulty does not exist. Another, but less certain test arises from\r\nthe fact that the Jaina saints are generally represented as\r\nnaked--Digambaras or Sky-clad, which in ancient times seems to have been\r\nthe most numerous sect, though another division or the Swetambaras, or\r\nWhite-robed, were clothed much like the Buddhist. When, therefore, a\r\nfigure of the class is represented as naked it may certainly be assumed\r\nto belong to the sect of the Jains, but the converse is by no means so\r\ncertain. If clad it may belong to either, and in consequence it is\r\nfrequently difficult to distinguish between late Buddhist and early\r\nJaina bas-reliefs and sculptures.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can at present see, the most hopeful source of information\r\nregarding Jaina architecture seems to be the ruined monasteries of the\r\nGandhara country (Woodcuts Nos. 92, 93, 96). The square or polygonal\r\ncourt of these viharas surrounded by cells containing images is what is\r\nfound in all Jaina temples. The square or circular altar, or place of\r\nworship, may easily be considered as the prototype of the Sikra\r\nsurrounded by cells of the Jains; and altogether these viharas, though\r\nprobably as early as the fourth or fifth century of our era, are more\r\nlike the temples at Abu and Girnar than anything intermediate. It is\r\nindeed every day becoming more and more apparent that, in consequence of\r\nour knowledge of Buddhist architecture being derived almost exclusively\r\nfrom rock-cut examples, we miss a great deal which, if derived from\r\nstructural buildings, would probably solve this among other problems\r\nthat are now perplexing us.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply equally to the Jaina caves. Those at Ellora and\r\nBadami do not help us in our investigation, because they are not copies\r\nof structural buildings, but are imitations of the rock-cut examples of\r\nthe Hindus, which had grown up into a style of their own, distinct from\r\nthat of structural edifices. These, being interposed between the\r\nBuddhist and Jaina styles, separate the two as completely as if no\r\nexamples existed, and prevent our tracing any connexion that may have\r\nexisted between the two forms of art.\r\n\r\nThe earliest hint we get of a twelve-pillared dome, such as those\r\nuniversally used by the Jains, is in a sepulchre at Mylassa,[249]\r\nprobably belonging to the 4th century. A second hint is found in the\r\ngreat cave at Bagh (Woodcut No. 87) in the 6th or 7th century, and there\r\nis little doubt that others will be found when looked for--but where? In\r\nthe valley of the Ganges, and wherever the Mahomedans settled in force,\r\nit would be in vain to look for them. These zealots found the slender\r\nand elegant pillars, and the richly carved horizontal domes of the\r\nJains, so appropriate and so easily re-arranged for their purposes, that\r\nthey utilised all they cared not to destroy. The great mosques of Ajmir,\r\nDelhi, Canouge, Dhar and Ahmedabad, are all merely reconstructed temples\r\nof the Jains. There is, however, nothing in any of them that seems to\r\nbelong to a very remote period--nothing in fact that can be carried back\r\nto times long, if at all, anterior to the year 1000. So we must look\r\nfurther for the cause of their loss.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the introduction the curtain drops on the drama of\r\nIndian history about the year 650, or a little later, and for three\r\ncenturies we have only the faintest glimmerings of what took place\r\nwithin her boundaries. Civil wars seem to have raged everywhere, and\r\nreligious persecution of the most relentless kind. When the curtain\r\nagain rises we have an entirely new scene and new dramatis personæ\r\npresented to us. Buddhism had entirely disappeared, except in one corner\r\nof Bengal, and Jainism had taken its place throughout the west, and\r\nVishnuism had usurped its inheritance in the east. On the south the\r\nreligion of Siva had been adopted by the mass of the people, and these\r\nthree religions had all assumed new and complex forms from the adoption\r\nof local superstitions, and differed widely from the simpler forms of\r\nthe earlier faiths. My impression is that it was during these three\r\ncenturies of misrule that the later temples and viharas of the Buddhists\r\ndisappeared, and the earlier temples of the Jains; and there is a gap\r\nconsequently in our history which may be filled up by new discoveries in\r\nremote places,[250] but which at present separates this chapter from the\r\nlast in a manner it is by no means pleasant to contemplate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nArches--Domes--Plans--Sikras.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHES.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the arrangements of Jaina or Hindu\r\ntemples, it may add to the clearness of what follows if we first explain\r\nthe peculiar modes of constructing arches and domes which they\r\ninvariably employed.\r\n\r\nAs remarked above, although we cannot assert with absolute certainty\r\nthat the Buddhists never employed a true arch, this at least is\r\ncertain--that no structural example has yet been found in India, and\r\nthat all the arched or circular forms found in the caves are without one\r\nsingle exception copies of wooden forms, and nowhere even simulate stone\r\nconstruction. With the Hindus and Jains the case is different: they use\r\nstone arches and stone domes which are not copied from wooden forms at\r\nall; but these are invariably horizontal arches, never formed or\r\nintended to be formed with radiating voussoirs.\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained, in speaking of Pelasgic art,[251] how\r\nprevalent these forms were in ancient Greece and Asia Minor, and how\r\nlong they continued to be employed even after the principles of the true\r\narch were perfectly understood. In India, however, the adherence to this\r\nform of construction is even more remarkable. As the Hindus quaintly\r\nexpress it, “an arch never sleeps;” and it is true that a radiating arch\r\ndoes contain in itself a _vis viva_ which is always tending to thrust\r\nits haunches outwards, and goes far to ensure the ultimate destruction\r\nof every building where it is employed: while the horizontal forms\r\nemployed by the Hindus are in stable equilibrium, and, unless disturbed\r\nby violence, might remain so for ever.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Hindus carried their horror of an arch to\r\nan excess which frequently led them to worse faults on the other side.\r\nIn city walls for instance, where there is a superabundant abutment on\r\neither hand to counteract any thrust, the horizontal principle is\r\nentirely misplaced. If we take, for instance, one of the city gates at\r\nBijanagur (Woodcut No. 108), we cannot help perceiving that with much\r\nsmaller stones and less trouble a far more stable construction could\r\nhave been obtained, so long as the wall on either hand remained entire.\r\nWhat the Hindu feared was that if the wall were shattered, as we now\r\nfind it, the arch would have fallen, though the horizontal layers still\r\nremain in their places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 108. View of City Gateway, Bijanagur. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 109. Gateway, Jinjûwarra. (From Kinloch Forbes’ ‘Ras\r\nMala.’)]\r\n\r\nInstead of a continuous bracket like that shown in the last example, a\r\nmore usual form, in modern times at least, is that of several detached\r\nbrackets placed a little distance apart the one from the other. When\r\nused in moderation this is the more pleasing form of the two, and in\r\nsouthern India it is generally used with great success. In the north\r\nthey are liable to exaggerate it, as in the gateway from Jinjûwarra in\r\nGujerat (Woodcut No. 109, p. 211), when it becomes unpleasing, though\r\nsingularly characteristic of the style.\r\n\r\nIt is this horizontal or bracket mode of construction that is the\r\nformative principle of the Dravidian or Southern style of Hindu\r\narchitecture, every form and every ornament depending almost wholly upon\r\nit. In the north, however, another development of the same principle is\r\nfound in the horizontal dome, which is unknown in the south, but which\r\nhas given a new character to the style, and, as one of its most\r\nbeautiful features, demands a somewhat detailed explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMES.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that, while so much has been written on the\r\nhistory of the pointed arch, so little should have been said regarding\r\nthe history of domes: the one being a mere constructive peculiarity that\r\nmight very well have been dispensed with; the other being the noblest\r\nfeature in the styles in which it prevails, and perhaps the most\r\nimportant acquisition with which science has enriched the art of\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Treasuries of Mycenæ and Orchomenos, as well as the\r\nchambers in Etruscan tombs, prove that as early as ten or twelve\r\ncenturies before Christ the Pelasgic races had learned the art of\r\nroofing circular chambers with stone vaults, not constructed, as we\r\nconstruct them, with radiating vaults, on the principle of the common\r\narch, but by successive layers of stones converging to a point, and\r\nclosed by one large stone at the apex.\r\n\r\nWhoever invented the true or radiating arch, the Romans were the first\r\nwho applied it as a regular and essential architectural feature, and who\r\nat the same time introduced its complement, the radiating dome, into\r\narchitectural construction; at what period it is not now known. The\r\nearliest example, the Pantheon, is also the finest and largest; but we\r\nhave lost entirely the innumerable steps by which the architects must\r\nhave slowly progressed to so daring an experiment.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a vast difference between these two classes of domes,\r\nwhich it is necessary to bear in mind in order to understand what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe Roman arch and Roman dome are always constructed (Woodcut No. 110)\r\non the principle of voussoirs, or truncated wedges, radiating from a\r\ncentre. This enabled the Romans to cover much larger spaces with their\r\ndomes than perhaps was possible on the horizontal principle; but it\r\ninvolved the inconvenience of great lateral thrusts, continually tending\r\nto split the dome and tear the building in pieces, and requiring immense\r\nand massive abutments to counteract their destructive energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 110. Radiating Arch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 111. Horizontal Arch.]\r\n\r\nThe Indian or horizontal dome never can be made circular in section,\r\nexcept when used on the smallest scale, but almost always takes a form\r\nmore or less pointed (Woodcut No. 111). From the time of the building of\r\nthe Treasury of Mycenæ[252] to the birth of Christ we have a tolerably\r\ncomplete series of arches and vaults constructed on this principle, but\r\nfew domes properly so called. After the Christian Era the first example\r\nis found in a singular tomb at Mylassa,[253] near Halicarnassus,[254]\r\nwhere the dome exhibits all the peculiarities of construction found in\r\nthe Jaina temples of India. After this we lose the thread of its history\r\ntill the form reappears in porches like those of the 11th century on\r\nMount Abu, where it is a perfectly established architectural feature,\r\nthat must have been practised long before it could be used as we find it\r\nin that building. Whether we shall ever be able to recover the lost\r\nlinks in this chain is more than doubtful, but it would be deeply\r\ninteresting to the history of art if it could be done. In the meantime,\r\nthere is no difficulty in explaining the constructive steps by which the\r\nobject is now attained in India. These may also throw some light on the\r\nhistory of the invention, though this is not, of course, capable of\r\ndirect proof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 112. Diagram of Roofing.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest mode of roofing a small square space supported by four\r\npillars is merely to run an architrave or stone beam from each pillar,\r\nand cover the intermediate opening by a plain stone slab. Unless,\r\nhowever, slabs of great dimensions are available, this mode of\r\nconstruction has a limit very soon arrived at. The next step therefore\r\nis to reduce the extent of the central space to be covered by cutting\r\noff its corners; this is done by triangular stones placed in each angle\r\nof the square, as in Woodcut No. 112, thus employing five stones\r\ninstead of one. By this means, the size of the central stone remaining\r\nthe same, the side of the square space so roofed is increased in the\r\nratio of ten to seven, the actual area being doubled. The next step in\r\nthe process (Woodcut No. 113) is by employing three tiers and nine\r\nstones instead of two tiers and five stones, which quadruples the area\r\nroofed. Thus, if the central stone is 4 ft., by the second process the\r\nspace roofed will be about 5 ft. 8 in.; by the third 8 ft. square; by a\r\nfourth process (Woodcut No. 114)--with four tiers and thirteen\r\nstones--the extent roofed may be 9 ft. or 10 ft., always assuming the\r\ncentral stone to remain 4 ft. square. All these forms are still\r\ncurrently used in India, but with four pillars the process is seldom\r\ncarried further than this; with another tier, however, and eight pillars\r\n(as shown in Woodcut No. 115), it may be carried a step further--exactly\r\nthe extent to which it is carried in the tomb at Mylassa above referred\r\nto. In this, however, as in all instances of octagonal domes in this\r\nstyle, instead of the octagonal form being left as such, there are\r\nalways four external pillars at the angles, so that the square shape is\r\nretained, with twelve pillars, of which the eight internal pillars may\r\nbe taken as mere insertions to support the long architrave between the\r\nfour angular pillars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n113.      Diagrams of Roofing.      114.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 115. Diagram of Roofing.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that here again we come to a limit beyond which we cannot\r\nprogress without using large and long stones. This was sometimes met by\r\ncutting off the angles of the octagon, and making the lower course of\r\nsixteen sides. When this has been done an awkwardness arises in getting\r\nback to the square form. This was escaped from, in all the instances I\r\nam acquainted with, by adopting circular courses for all above that with\r\nsixteen sides. In many instances the lower course with sixteen sides is\r\naltogether omitted, and the circles placed immediately on the octagon,\r\nas in the temple at Vimala Sah (Woodcut No. 130, p. 236). It is\r\ndifficult to say how far this system might be carried constructively\r\nwithout danger of weakness. The Indian domes seldom exceed 30 ft. in\r\ndiameter, but this may have arisen more from the difficulty of getting\r\narchitraves above 12 ft. or 13 ft. in length to support the sides, than\r\nfrom any inability to construct domes of larger diameter in themselves.\r\nThis last difficulty was to some extent got over by a system of\r\nbracketing, by which more than half the bearing of the architrave was\r\nthrown on the capital of the column, as shown in Woodcut No. 116. Of\r\ncourse this method might have been carried to any extent, so that a very\r\nshort architrave would suffice for a large dome; but whether this could\r\nbe done with elegance is another matter. The Indians seem to have\r\nthought not; at least, so far as I know, they never carried it to any\r\nextent. Instead of bracketing, however, they sometimes used struts, as\r\nshown in Woodcut No. 116, but it is questionable whether that could ever\r\nbe made a really serviceable constructive expedient in stone\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 116. Diagram of Indian construction.\r\n\r\nB. Form of bracket capital in the angle of an octagonal dome.]\r\n\r\nThe great advantage to be derived from the mode of constructing domes\r\njust described was the power it gave of placing them on pillars without\r\nhaving anything to fear from the lateral thrust of the vault. The Romans\r\nnever even attempted this, but always, so to speak, brought their vaults\r\ndown to the ground, or at least could only erect them on great\r\ncylinders, which confined the space on every side. The Byzantine\r\narchitects, as we have seen, cut away a great deal of the substructure,\r\nbut nevertheless could never get rid of the great heavy piers they were\r\nforced to employ to support their domes, and in all ages were forced to\r\nuse either heavy abutments externally, or to crowd their interiors with\r\nmasses of masonry, so as in a great measure to sacrifice either the\r\nexternal effect or the internal convenience of their buildings to the\r\nconstructive exigencies of their domes. This in India never was the\r\ncase; all the pressure was vertical, and to ensure stability it only\r\nrequired sufficient strength in the support to bear the downward\r\npressure of the mass--an advantage the importance of which is not easily\r\nover-estimated.\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of this mode of construction was, that all the\r\ndecoration of the Indian domes was horizontal, or, in other words, the\r\nornaments were ranged in concentric rings, one above the other, instead\r\nof being disposed in vertical ribs, as in Roman or Gothic vaults. This\r\narrangement allows of far more variety without any offence to good\r\ntaste, and practically has rendered some of the Indian domes the most\r\nexquisite specimens of elaborate roofing that can anywhere be seen.\r\nAnother consequence of this mode of construction was the employment of\r\npendants from the centres of the domes, which are used to an extent that\r\nwould have surprised even the Tudor architects of our own country. With\r\nthem, however, the pendant was an architectural _tour de force_,\r\nrequiring great constructive ingenuity and large masses to\r\ncounterbalance it, and is always tending to destroy the building it\r\nornaments; while the Indian pendant, on the contrary, only adds its own\r\nweight to that of the dome, and has no other prejudicial tendency. Its\r\nforms, too, generally have a lightness and elegance never even imagined\r\nin Gothic art; it hangs from the centre of a dome more like a lustre of\r\ncrystal drops than a solid mass of marble or of stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 117. Diagram of the arrangement of the pillars of a Jaina\r\nDome.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 118. Diagram Plan of Jaina Porch.]\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, the eight pillars that support the dome are almost\r\nnever left by themselves, the base being made square by the addition of\r\nfour others at the angles. There are many small buildings so constructed\r\nwith only twelve pillars, as shown in the annexed diagram (No. 117), but\r\ntwo more are oftener added on each face, making twenty altogether, as\r\nshown on the upper side of the annexed diagram (No. 118); or four on\r\neach face, making twenty-eight; or again, two in front of these four, or\r\nsix on each face, so as to make thirty-six; and the same system of\r\naggregation is carried on till the number of pillars reaches fifty-six\r\n(Woodcut No. 119), which is the largest number I ever saw surrounding\r\none dome; but any number of these domes may surround one temple, or\r\ncentral dome, and the number consequently be multiplied _ad infinitum_.\r\nWhen so great a number of pillars is introduced as in the last instance,\r\nit is usual to make the outmost compartment on each face square, and\r\nsurmount it with a smaller dome. This is occasionally though rarely done\r\neven with the smallest number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 119. Diagram of Jaina Porch.]\r\n\r\nThe first result of this arrangement is, that the Hindus obtained\r\nsingularly varied outline in plan, producing the happiest effects of\r\nlight and shade with every change in the sun’s position. Another result\r\nwas, that by the accentuation of the salient and re-entering angles,\r\nthey produced those strongly-marked vertical lines which give such an\r\nappearance of height to Gothic designs. To accomplish this, however, the\r\nWestern architects were obliged to employ buttresses, pinnacles, and\r\nother constructive expedients. The Hindus obtained it by a new\r\ndisposition of the plan without anywhere interrupting the composition.\r\nThis form of outline also expresses the internal arrangements of the\r\nporch better than could be done by the simpler outline of either a\r\nsquare or circle, such as is usually employed in Europe. Its greatest\r\nmerit, however, is, that the length of the greater aisles is exactly\r\nproportioned to their relative width as compared with that of the\r\nsubordinate aisles. The entrance being in the angle, the great aisle\r\nforms the diagonal, and is consequently in the ratio of 10 to 7, as\r\ncompared to what it would be if the entrance were in the centre of the\r\nside, where we usually place it. From the introduction of the octagonal\r\ndome in the centre the same proportion (correctly 707 to 1000) prevails\r\nbetween the central and side aisles, and this again is perhaps the most\r\npleasing that has yet been introduced anywhere. In Gothic churches the\r\nprincipal aisles are generally twice as wide as the side ones, but they\r\nare also twice as high, which restores the proportion. Here, where the\r\nheight of all is the same, or nearly so, this gradation just suffices to\r\ngive variety, and to mark the relative importance of the parts, without\r\nthe one overpowering the other: and neither has the appearance of being\r\ntoo broad nor too narrow.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, difficult for those who have never seen a building of\r\nthe class just described to judge of the effect of these arrangements;\r\nand they have seldom been practised in Europe. There is, however, one\r\nbuilding in which they have accidentally been employed to a considerable\r\nextent, and which owes its whole beauty to the manner in which it\r\nfollows the arrangement above described. That building is Sir\r\nChristopher Wren’s church of St. Stephen’s, Walbrook. Internally its\r\nprincipal feature is a dome supported on eight pillars, with four more\r\nin the angles, and two principal aisles crossing the building at right\r\nangles, with smaller square compartments on each side. This church is\r\nthe great architect’s masterpiece, but it would have been greatly\r\nimproved had its resemblance to a Hindu porch been more complete. The\r\nnecessity of confining the dome and aisles within four walls greatly\r\ninjures the effect as compared with the Indian examples. Even the Indian\r\nplan of roofing, explained above, might be used in such a building with\r\nmuch less expense and less constructive danger than a Gothic vault of\r\nthe same extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANS.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time only one temple has been discovered in India\r\nwhich gives us even a hint of how the plans of the Buddhist Chaitya\r\nHalls became converted into those of the Jaina and Hindu temples.\r\nFortunately, however, its evidence is so distinct that there can be very\r\nlittle doubt about the matter. The temple in question is situated in the\r\nvillage of Aiwulli, in Dharwar, in western India, not far from the place\r\nwhere the original capital of the Chalukyan sovereigns is supposed to\r\nhave been situated, and near the caves of Badami on the one hand and the\r\ntemples of Pittadkul on the other. Its date is ascertained by an\r\ninscription on its outer gateway, containing the name of Vicramaditya\r\nChalukya, whom we know from inscriptions certainly died in A.D. 680, and\r\nwith less certainty that he commenced to reign A.D. 650.[255] The temple\r\nitself may possibly be a little older, but the latter may fairly be\r\ntaken as a medium date representing its age. It is thus not only the\r\noldest structural temple known to exist in western India, but in fact\r\nthe only one yet discovered that can with certainty be said to have been\r\nerected before the great cataclysm of the beginning of the 8th century.\r\n\r\nMr. Burgess is of opinion that it was originally dedicated to\r\nVishnu,[256] but this does not seem quite clear. There certainly are\r\nJaina figures among those that once adorned it;[257] and it seems to be\r\na fact that though the Jains admitted Siva, Vishnu, and all the gods of\r\nthe Hindu Pantheon into their temples, there is no evidence of the\r\nreverse process. The Hindus never admitted the human Tirthankars of the\r\nJains among their gods. Its original dedication is fortunately, however,\r\nof very little importance for our present purposes. The religions of the\r\nJains and Vaishnavas, as pointed out above (p. 40), were, in those days\r\nand for long afterwards, so similar that it was impossible to\r\ndistinguish between them.[258] Besides this, the age when this temple\r\nwas erected was the age of toleration in India. The Chinese traveller\r\nHiouen Thsang has left us a most vivid description of a great\r\nquinquennial festival, at which he was present at Allahabad in A.D. 643,\r\nat which the great King Siladitya presided, and distributed alms and\r\nhonours, on alternate days, to Buddhists, Brahmans, and heretics of all\r\nclasses, who were assembled there in tens of thousands, and seem to have\r\nfelt no jealousy of each other, or rivalry that led, at least, to any\r\ndisturbance.[259] It was on the eve of a disruption that led to the most\r\nviolent contests, but up to that time we have no trace of dissension\r\namong the sects, nor any reason to believe that they did not all use\r\nsimilar edifices for their religious purposes, with only such slight\r\nmodifications as their different formulæ may have required (Woodcut No.\r\n120).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 120. Old Temple at Aiwulli. (From a Plan by Mr. Burgess.)\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, any one who will compare the plan of the chaitya at\r\nSanchi (Woodcut No. 40), which is certainly Buddhist, with that of this\r\ntemple at Aiwulli, which is either Jaina or Vaishnava, can hardly fail\r\nto perceive how nearly identical they must have been when complete. In\r\nboth instances, it will be observed, the apse is solid, and it appears\r\nthat this always was the case in structural free-standing chaityas. At\r\nleast, in all the rock-cut examples, so far as is known, the pillars\r\nround the apse are different from those that separate the nave from the\r\naisles; they never have capitals or bases, and are mere plain\r\nmakeshifts. From the nature of their situation in the rock, light could\r\nnot be admitted to the aisle behind the apse from the outside, but must\r\nbe borrowed from the front, and a solid apse was consequently\r\ninadmissible; but in free-standing examples, as at Aiwulli, it was easy\r\nto introduce windows there or anywhere. Another change was necessary\r\nwhen, from an apse sheltering a relic-shrine, it became a cell\r\ncontaining an image of a god; a door was then indispensable, and also a\r\nthickening of the wall when it was necessary it should bear a tower or\r\nsikra to mark the position of the cella on the outside. Omitting the\r\nverandah, the other changes introduced between the erection of these two\r\nexamples are only such as were required to adapt the points of support\r\nin the temple to carry a heavy stone roof, instead of the light wooden\r\nsuperstructure of the Buddhist chaitya. (Woodcut No. 121.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 121. Temple at Aiwulli. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nIt may be a question, and one not easy to settle in the present state of\r\nour knowledge, whether the Buddhist chaityas had or had not verandahs,\r\nlike the Aiwulli example. The rock-cut examples naturally give us no\r\ninformation on this subject, but the presumption certainly is, looking\r\nat their extreme appropriateness in that climate, that they had this\r\nappendage, sometimes at least, if not always.\r\n\r\nIf from this temple at Aiwulli we pass to the neighbouring one at\r\nPittadkul, built probably a couple of centuries later, we find that we\r\nhave passed the boundary line that separates the ancient from the\r\nmediæval architecture of India, in so far at least as plans are\r\nconcerned (Woodcut No. 122). The circular forms of the Buddhists have\r\nentirely disappeared, and the cell has become the base of a square\r\ntower, as it remained ever afterwards. The nave of the chaitya has\r\nbecome a well defined mantapa or porch in front of, but distinct from,\r\nthe cell, and these two features in an infinite variety of forms, and\r\nwith various subordinate adjuncts, are the essential elements of the\r\nplans of the Jaina and Hindu temples of all the subsequent ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 122. Plan of Temple at Pittadkul. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe procession-path round the cell--called Pradakshina--as that round\r\nthe apse, remained for some centuries as a common but not a universal\r\nfeature. The verandah disappeared. Round a windowless cell it was\r\nuseless, and the pillared porches contained in themselves all the\r\nelements of shelter or of shadow that were required.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIKRAS.\r\n\r\nThere is one other peculiarity common to both Jaina and Hindu\r\narchitecture in the north of India that requires notice, before\r\nproceeding to describe particular examples. It is the form of the towers\r\nor spires called Sikras, or Vimanas, which invariably surmount the cells\r\nin which the images are placed. It is probably correct to assert that\r\nthe images of the Tirthankars or of the Hindu deities are invariably\r\nplaced in square, generally cubical cells, of no great dimension, and\r\nthat these cells receive their light from the doorway only. It seems\r\nalso an invariable rule that the presence and position of the cell\r\nshould be indicated externally by a tower or spire, and that these\r\ntowers, though square or nearly so in plan, should have a curvilinear\r\noutline in elevation. If the tower at Buddh Gaya (_ante_, p. 70) retains\r\nunaltered the original form given to it when erected in the 5th or 6th\r\ncentury, this dictum would not apply to Buddhist architecture. As it is,\r\nhowever, the only Buddhist sikra yet discovered it is hardly fair to\r\ndraw any decided inference from one single example, while with Jaina or\r\nHindu towers I know of no exception. Take for instance the tower\r\nrepresented in the following woodcut (No. 123), which purports to be an\r\nelevation of the celebrated Black Pagoda at Kanaruc in Orissa, and may\r\nbe looked upon as a typical example of the style, and of which it may be\r\nconsidered as a fair medium example. The upper part of the tower, to\r\nsome extent, overhangs its base. It bends inward towards the summit, and\r\nis surmounted by what is called an Amalaka from its supposed resemblance\r\nto a fruit of the name--_Phyllanthus emblica_. This, however, is\r\ncertainly a mistake. Had it been said it was copied from a melon or any\r\nlarge gourd that was divided into pips externally--if there are any\r\nsuch--there are some early examples that might seem to countenance such\r\nan idea; but the _Phyllanthus_ is so insignificant a berry that it could\r\nhardly ever have been adopted as an architectural model. Besides this\r\nits peculiar nicked form occurs frequently in old examples as a sort of\r\nblocking course dividing the sikras horizontally into numerous small\r\ncompartments, and it seems as if what is used there in a straight-lined\r\nform, was employed as a circular ornament at the summit. It is a very\r\nbeautiful architectural device, and was, as far as I can see, adopted\r\nonly because it was so, and contrasted brilliantly with the flat\r\nornaments with which it was employed. At present we do not seem to be in\r\na position to explain its origin, or that of a great many other details\r\nthat are frequently met with in Hindu architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 123. Restored Elevation of the Black Pagoda at Ranaruc.\r\n(From a Drawing by the Author.) No scale.]\r\n\r\nWhatever its origin, this amalaka is generally surmounted by a flat dome\r\nof reverse curvature, in the centre of which stands the kullus, or\r\npinnacle, in the form of a vase, generally of very beautiful and\r\ngraceful design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 124. Diagram Plan and Section of the Black Pagoda at\r\nKanaruc, designed to explain the construction of Hindu Temples.]\r\n\r\nThe great and at first sight puzzling question is, from what original is\r\nthis curious combination of forms derived? It is like nothing found\r\nanywhere out of India, and like no utilitarian form in India that we now\r\nknow of. It cannot be derived from the dome-like forms of the topes.\r\nThey are circular both in plan and elevation. The sikras are\r\nstraight-lined in plan, and their section is never a segment of a\r\ncircle; it is not derived from any many-storeyed buildings, as the\r\nsikras or vimanas of the Dravidian architecture of the south of India,\r\nwhich seem certainly to have been copied from the many-storeyed viharas\r\nof the Buddhists, and we cannot fancy any class of domestic building\r\nwhich could have formed a model out of which they could have been\r\nelaborated. One curious thing we do know, which is that all the ancients\r\nroofs in India, whether represented in the bas-reliefs or copied in the\r\ncaves, were invariably curvilinear--generally circular or rather\r\nogee--having a ridge added externally to throw off the rain from that\r\nweakest part; but nothing on any bas-relief or painting gives us a hint\r\nof any building like these sikras.\r\n\r\nAnother curious and perplexing circumstance regarding the sikras is that\r\nwhen we first meet them, at Bhuvaneswar for instance, or the Bay of\r\nBengal, or at Pittadkul in the 7th century, on the west coast of India,\r\nthe style is complete and settled in all its parts. There was no\r\nhesitation then, nor has there been any since. During the twelve or\r\nthirteen centuries that have elapsed since the erection of these\r\nearliest known examples, they have gone on becoming more and more\r\nattenuated, till they are almost as pointed as Gothic spires, and their\r\ndegree of attenuation is no bad test of their age; but they never\r\nchanged in any essential feature of the design. All the parts found in\r\nthe oldest examples are retained in the most recent, and are easily\r\nrecognisable in the buildings of the present century.\r\n\r\nThe one hypothesis that occurs to me as sufficient to account for this\r\npeculiarity is to assume that it was a constructive necessity. If we\r\ntake for instance an assumed section of the diagram (Woodcut No. 124, p.\r\n223), it will be seen how easily a very tall pointed horizontal arch,\r\nlike that of the Treasury at Mycenæ (Woodcut No. 122, vol. i.), would\r\nfit its external form. In that case we might assume that the tower at\r\nBuddh Gaya took a straight-lined form like that represented in Woodcuts\r\nNos. 128, 129, vol. i., while the Hindus took the more graceful\r\ncurvilinear shape, which certainly was more common in remote classical\r\nantiquity,[260] and as it is found in Assyria may have reached India at\r\na remote period.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis does not account for the change from the square to the\r\ncircular form in the upper part, nor for its peculiar ornamentation; but\r\nthat may be owing to our having none of the earlier examples. When we\r\nfirst meet with the form, either in Dharwar or Orissa, it is complete in\r\nall its parts, and had evidently reached that state of perfection\r\nthrough long stages of tentative experience. The discovery of some\r\nearlier examples than we now know may one day tell us by what steps that\r\ndegree of perfection was reached, but in the meanwhile I fear we must\r\nrest content with the theory just explained, which, on the whole, may be\r\nconsidered sufficient for present purposes at least.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN JAINA STYLE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nPalitana--Girnar--Mount Abu--Parisnath--Gualior--Khajurâho.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALITANA.\r\n\r\nThe grouping together of their temples into what may be called “Cities\r\nof Temples” is a peculiarity which the Jains practised to a greater\r\nextent than the followers of any other religion in India. The Buddhists\r\ngrouped their stupas and viharas near and around sacred spots, as at\r\nSanchi, Manikyala, or in Peshawur, and elsewhere; but they were\r\nscattered, and each was supposed to have a special meaning, or to mark\r\nsome sacred spot. The Hindus also grouped their temples, as at\r\nBhuvaneswar or Benares, in great numbers together; but in all cases, so\r\nfar as we know, because these were the centres of a population who\r\nbelieved in the gods to whom the temples were dedicated, and wanted them\r\nfor the purposes of their worship. Neither of these religions, however,\r\npossess such a group of temples, for instance, as that at Sutrunjya, or\r\nPalitana, as it is usually called, in Gujerat, about thirty miles from\r\nGogo, on its eastern coast (Woodcut No. 125). No survey has yet been\r\nmade of it, nor have its temples been counted; but it covers a very\r\nlarge space of ground, and its shrines are scattered by hundreds over\r\nthe summits of two extensive hills and in the valley between them. The\r\nlarger ones are situated in tûks, or separate enclosures, surrounded by\r\nhigh fortified walls; the smaller ones line the silent streets. A few\r\nyatis, or priests, sleep in the temples and perform the daily services,\r\nand a few attendants are constantly there to keep the place clean, which\r\nthey do with the most assiduous attention, or to feed the sacred\r\npigeons, which are the sole denizens of the spot; but there are no human\r\nhabitations, properly so called, within the walls. The pilgrim or the\r\nstranger ascends in the morning, and returns when he has performed his\r\ndevotions or satisfied his curiosity. He must not eat, or at least must\r\nnot cook his food, on the sacred hill, and he must not sleep there. It\r\nis a city of the gods, and meant for them only, and not intended for the\r\nuse of mortals.\r\n\r\nJaina temples and shrines are, of course, to be found in cities, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 125. The Sacred Hill of Sutrunjya, near Palitana.]\r\n\r\nwhere there are a sufficient number of votaries to support a temple, as\r\nin other religions; but, beyond this, the Jains seem, almost more than\r\nany sect, to have realised the idea that to build a temple, and to place\r\nan image in it, was in itself a highly meritorious act, wholly\r\nirrespective of its use to any of their co-religionists. Building a\r\ntemple is with them a prayer in stone, which they conceive to be\r\neminently acceptable to the deity and likely to secure them benefits\r\nboth here and hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt is in consequence of the Jains believing to a greater extent than the\r\nother Indian sects in the efficacy of temple-building as a means of\r\nsalvation, that their architectural performances bear so much larger a\r\nproportion to their numbers than those of other religions. It may also\r\nbe owing to the fact that nine out of ten, or ninety-nine in a hundred,\r\nof the Jaina temples are the gifts of single wealthy individuals of the\r\nmiddle classes, that these buildings generally are small and deficient\r\nin that grandeur of proportion that marks the buildings undertaken by\r\nroyal command or belonging to important organised communities. It may,\r\nhowever, be also owing to this that their buildings are more elaborately\r\nfinished than those of more national importance. When a wealthy\r\nindividual of the class who build these temples desires to spend his\r\nmoney on such an object, he is much more likely to feel pleasure in\r\nelaborate detail and exquisite finish than on great purity or grandeur\r\nof conception.\r\n\r\nAll these peculiarities are found in a more marked degree at Palitana\r\nthan at almost any other known place, and, fortunately for the student\r\nof the style, extending through all the ages during which it flourished.\r\nSome of the temples are as old as the 11th century, and they are spread\r\npretty evenly over all the intervening period down to the present\r\ncentury. But the largest number and some of the most important are now\r\nerecting or were erected in the present century or in the memory of\r\nliving men. Fortunately, too, these modern examples by no means disgrace\r\nthe age in which they are built. Their sculptures are inferior, and some\r\nof their details are deficient in meaning and expression; but, on the\r\nwhole, they are equal, or nearly so, to the average examples of earlier\r\nages. It is this that makes Palitana one of the most interesting places\r\nthat can be named for the philosophical student of architectural art,\r\ninasmuch as he can there see the various processes by which cathedrals\r\nwere produced in the Middle Ages, carried on on a larger scale than\r\nalmost anywhere else, and in a more natural manner. It is by watching\r\nthe methods still followed in designing buildings in that remote\r\nlocality that we become aware how it is that the uncultivated Hindu can\r\nrise in architecture to a degree of originality and perfection which has\r\nnot been attained in Europe since the Middle Ages, but which might\r\neasily be recovered by following the same processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRNAR.\r\n\r\nThe hill of Girnar, on the south coast of Gujerat, not far from Puttun\r\nSomnath, is another shrine of the Jains, as sacred, but somehow not so\r\nfashionable in modern times as that at Palitana. It wants, consequently,\r\nthat bewildering magnificence arising from the number and variety of\r\nbuildings of all ages that crowd that temple city. Besides this, the\r\ntemples themselves at Girnar lose much of their apparent size from being\r\nperched on the side of a hill rising 3500 ft. above the level of the\r\nsea, composed of granite rocks strewn about in most picturesque\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no Girnar Mahatmya to retail fables and falsify dates,\r\nas is done at Sutrunjya, we have at Girnar inscriptions which prove that\r\nin ancient times it must have been a place of great importance. On a\r\nrock outside the town at its foot, called _par excellence_ Junaghar--the\r\nOld Fort--Asoka, B.C. 250, carved a copy of his celebrated edicts.[262]\r\nOn the same rock, in A.D. 151, Rudra Dama, the Sah king of Saurastra,\r\ncarved an inscription, in which he boasted of his victories over the Sat\r\nKarni, king of the Dekhan, and recorded his having repaired the bridge\r\nbuilt by the Maurya Asoka.[263] The embankment of the Sudarsana lake\r\nagain burst and carried away this bridge, but was again repaired by\r\nSkanda, the last of the great Guptas, in the year A.D. 457,[264] and\r\nanother inscription on the same rock records this event.\r\n\r\nA place where three such kings thought it worth while to record their\r\ndeeds or proclaim their laws must, one would think, have been an\r\nimportant city or place at that time; but what is so characteristic of\r\nIndia occurs here as elsewhere. No material remains are found to testify\r\nto the fact.[265] There are no remains of an ancient city, no temples or\r\nruins that can approach the age of the inscriptions, and but for their\r\nexistence we should not be aware that the place was known before the\r\n10th century. There are, it is true, some caves in the Uparkot which may\r\nbe old; but they have not yet been examined by any one capable of\r\ndiscriminating between ancient and modern things, and till so visited\r\ntheir evidence is not available.[266] My impression is that they may\r\nbelong to the age of the Guptas, which was a great age for excavating\r\ncaves of this class in India, but we must await further information\r\nbefore deciding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 126. Temple of Neminatha, Girnar. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe principal group of temples at Girnar, some sixteen in number, is\r\nsituated on a ledge about 600 ft. below the summit, and still\r\nconsequently nearly 3000 ft. above the level of the sea. The largest,\r\npossibly also the oldest of these, is that of Neminatha (Woodcut No.\r\n120). An inscription upon it records that it was repaired in A.D. 1278,\r\nand unfortunately a subsequent restorer has laid his heavy hand upon it,\r\nso that it is difficult now to realise what its original appearance may\r\nhave been. This unfortunately is only too often the case with Jaina\r\ntemples. If a Hindu temple or Mahomedan mosque is once deserted and goes\r\nto decay, no one ever after repairs it, but its materials are ruthlessly\r\nemployed to build a new temple or mosque according to the newest fashion\r\nof the day. With the Jains it is otherwise. If a man is not rich enough\r\nto build a new fane, he may at least be able to restore an old one, and\r\nthe act with them seems equally meritorious, as it usually is considered\r\nto be with us; but the way they set about it generally consists in\r\ncovering up the whole of the outside with a thick coating of chunam,\r\nfilling up and hiding all the details, and leaving only the outline. The\r\ninterior is generally adorned with repeated coats of whitewash, as\r\ndestructive to artistic effect, but not so irreparable.\r\n\r\nThe plan and the outline are generally, however, left as they were\r\noriginally erected, and that is the case with the temple of Neminatha.\r\nIt stands in a courtyard measuring 195 ft. by 130 ft. over all\r\nexternally. The temple itself has two porches or mantapas, one of which\r\nis called by Hindu architects the Maha Mantapa, the other the Ard’ha\r\nMantapa,[267] though it is not quite clear to which of the two the term\r\nMaha, or great, should be applied in this instance; I would say the\r\ninner, though that is certainly not the sense in which the term is\r\nusually understood.\r\n\r\nAround the courtyard are arranged seventy cells with a covered and\r\nenclosed passage in front of them, and each of these contains a\r\ncross-legged seated figure of the Tirthankar to whom the temple is\r\ndedicated, and generally with a bas-relief or picture representing some\r\nact in his life. But for the fall of the rock there would have been nine\r\nor ten more cells, and indeed this repetition of the images of the\r\nsaint, like the multiplication of temples, seems to have been the great\r\naim of the Jaina architects. As we shall presently see in a Jaina temple\r\nat Brambanam in Java, there were 236 small temples or cells surrounding\r\nthe great one, and there, as here, each of them was intended to contain\r\na similar image of one of the Tirthankars.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the temple of Neminatha is a triple one erected by\r\nthe brothers Tejpala and Vastupala, who also erected one of the\r\nprincipal temples in Abu. From inscriptions upon its walls it seems to\r\nhave been erected in A.D. 1177. The plan is that of three temples joined\r\ntogether, an arrangement not unfrequently found in the south, but rare\r\nin the north, which is to be regretted, as it is capable of great\r\nvariety of effect, and of light and shade to a greater extent than\r\nplainer forms. In this instance there is an image of Mallinatha, the\r\n19th Tirthankar, in the central cell, but the lateral ones each contain\r\na remarkable solid pile of masonry called a Samosan, that on the north\r\nside named Mera or Sumera--a fabled mountain of the Jains and\r\nHindus--having a square base (Woodcut No. 127); that on the south,\r\ncalled Samet Sikhara--Parisnath, in Bengal--with a nearly circular base.\r\nEach rises in four tiers of diminishing width, nearly to the roof, and\r\nis surmounted by a small square canopy over the images.[268] From this\r\nit would appear that with the Jains, the Mounts Girnar, Sutrunjya, Abu,\r\n&c., were not only holy places, but holy things, and that with them--as\r\nwith the Syrians--the worship of high places was really a part of their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 127. Plan of Temple of Tejpala and Vastupala. (From a\r\nPlan by Mr. Burgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nSome of the other temples at Girnar are interesting from their history,\r\nand remarkable from fragments of an ancient date that have survived the\r\ntoo constant repairs; but without illustrating them it would only be\r\ntedious to recapitulate their names, or to attempt to describe by words\r\nobjects which only the practised eye of the Indian antiquary can\r\nappreciate. Not far from the hill, however, on the sea-shore, stands the\r\ntemple of Somnath, historically perhaps the most celebrated in India,\r\nfrom the campaign which Mahmood of Gazni undertook for its destruction\r\nin 1025, and the momentous results that campaign had eventually on the\r\nfate of India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 128. Plan of Temple at Somnath. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the annexed plan (Woodcut No. 128) the temple\r\nitself never could have been remarkable for its dimensions, probably it\r\nnever exceeded about 130 ft. over all, but the dome of its porch, which\r\nmeasures 33 ft. across, is as large as any we know of its age. From the\r\naccounts, however, which we have of the siege, it is evident that it was\r\nenclosed like the temple of Neminatha (Woodcut No. 126) in a courtyard,\r\nand that may have been of surpassing magnificence. Though very similar\r\nin plan, it is nearly twice the dimensions of that of Neminatha, and if\r\nits court was proportionately large, it may really have justified all\r\nthat has been said regarding its splendour. From what fragments of its\r\nsculptured decorations remain, they too must have been of great beauty,\r\nquite equal to anything we know of this class, or of their age. It has\r\nnot yet been determined, however, whether what we now see are fragments\r\nof the temple attacked by Mahmood, and consequently whether they belong\r\nto the 10th or even the 9th century, or whether they may be due to a\r\nrepair which was effected in the 12th. As the story is now told, after\r\nMahmood’s departure it was restored by Bhima Deva of Anhilwarra Puttun,\r\nwho reigned 1021-1073, and adorned by Siddha Raja, 1093-1143, and lastly\r\nby Kumara Pala in 1168. Generally it is thought that what we now see\r\nbelongs to the last-named king. Any one on the spot, thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the subject, might discriminate among these and tell us\r\nits story. In so far as photographs enable us to judge, it would appear\r\nthat a considerable portion of what we now see belongs to the original\r\nfane, though very much altered and knocked about by subsequent\r\nrestorers.\r\n\r\nAnother point of dispute is the name of the god to whom the temple was\r\ndedicated when the Moslem marched against it. From the name Someswara,\r\nit is generally assumed to have been Siva. If, however, that had been\r\nthe case, the image in the sanctuary would almost certainly have been a\r\nlingam. The Mahomedan historians, however, represent it distinctly as\r\nhaving a head with eyes, arms, and a belly.[269] In that case it must\r\neither have been Vishnu or one of the Tirthankars. I can find no trace\r\nof Vishnuism in Gujerat at this period, but what seems to me to settle\r\nthe case is, that all the kings above mentioned, who took part in the\r\nrepairs after the departure of Mahmood, were undoubtedly Jains, and they\r\nwould hardly have repaired or rebuilt a temple belonging to another\r\nsect.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT ABU.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be wondered at that Mount Abu was early fixed upon by\r\nthe Hindus and Jains as one of their sacred spots. Rising from the\r\ndesert as abruptly as an island from the ocean, it presents on almost\r\nevery side inaccessible scarps 5000 ft. or 6000 ft. high, and the summit\r\ncan only be approached by ravines cut into its sides. When the summit is\r\nreached, it opens out into one of the loveliest valleys imaginable, six\r\nor seven miles long by two or three miles in width, cut up everywhere by\r\ngranite rocks of the most fantastic shapes, and the spaces between them\r\ncovered with trees and luxuriant vegetation. The little Nucki Talao, or\r\nPearl Lake, is one of the loveliest gems of its class in all India, and\r\nit is near to it, at Dilwarra, that the Jains selected a site for their\r\nTirth, or sacred place of rendezvous. It cannot, however, be said that\r\nit has been a favourite place of worship in modern times. Its distance\r\nand inaccessibility are probably the causes of this, and it consequently\r\ncannot rival either Palitana or Girnar in the extent of its buildings;\r\nbut during the age of Jaina supremacy it was adorned with several\r\ntemples, two of which are unrivalled for certain qualities by any\r\ntemples in India. They are built wholly of white marble, though no\r\nquarries of that material are known to exist within 300 miles of the\r\nspot, and to transport and carry it up the hill to the site of these\r\ntemples must have added immensely to the expense of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe more modern of the two was built by the same brothers, Tejpala and\r\nVastupala, who erected the triple temple at Girnar (Woodcut No. 127).\r\nThis one, we learn from inscriptions, was erected between the years 1197\r\nand 1247, and for minute delicacy of carving and beauty of detail stands\r\nalmost unrivalled even in the land of patient and lavish labour.[270]\r\n\r\nThe other, built by another merchant prince, Vimala Sah, apparently\r\nabout the year A.D. 1032,[271] is simpler and bolder, though still as\r\nelaborate as good taste would allow in any purely architectural object.\r\nBeing one of the oldest as well as one of the most complete examples\r\nknown of a Jaina temple, its peculiarities form a convenient\r\nintroduction to the style, and among other things serve to illustrate\r\nhow complete and perfect it had already become when we first meet with\r\nit in India.\r\n\r\nThe annexed plan (Woodcut No. 129) will suffice to explain the general\r\narrangements of the temple of Vimala Sah, which, as will be observed,\r\nare similar to some we have already met, though of course varying\r\nconsiderably in extent and detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 129. Temple of Vimala Sah, Mount Abu. (From a Plan by the\r\nAuthor.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe principal object here, as elsewhere, is a cell lighted only from the\r\ndoor, containing a cross-legged seated figure of the saint to whom the\r\ntemple is dedicated, in this instance Parswanatha. The cell, as in all\r\nother examples, terminates upwards in a sikra, or pyramidal spire-like\r\nroof, which is common to all Hindu and Jaina temples[272] of the age in\r\nthe north of India. To this, as in almost all instances, is attached a\r\nportico, generally of considerable extent, and in most examples\r\nsurmounted by a dome resting on eight pillars, which forms indeed the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the style, as well as its most\r\nbeautiful feature. In this example the portico is composed of\r\nforty-eight free-standing pillars, which is by no means an unusual\r\nnumber; and the whole is enclosed in an oblong courtyard, about 140 ft.\r\nby 90 ft., surrounded by a double colonnade of smaller pillars, forming\r\nporticos to a range of cells, fifty-five in number, which enclose it on\r\nall sides, exactly as they do in Buddhist viharas. In this case,\r\nhowever, each cell, instead of being the residence of a monk, is\r\noccupied by one of those cross-legged images which belong alike to\r\nBuddhism and Jainism, and between which so many find it difficult to\r\ndistinguish. Here they are, according to the Jaina practice, all\r\nrepetitions of the same image of Parswanatha, and over the door of each\r\ncell, or on its jambs, are sculptured scenes from his life.\r\n\r\nIn other religions there may be a great number of separate similar\r\nchapels attached to one building, but in no other would fifty-five be\r\nfound, as in this example, or the seventy that surround the temple of\r\nNeminatha at Girnar (Woodcut No. 126), each containing an image of the\r\nsame saint, and all so identical as to be undistinguishable. With the\r\nJains it seems to be thought the most important point that the deity or\r\nsaint is honoured by the number of his images, and that each image\r\nshould be provided with a separate abode. In other examples, however, it\r\nis only a separate niche. On some Jaina monuments the image of the\r\nTirthankar is repeated hundreds, it may almost be said a thousand times\r\nover, all the images identical, and the niches arranged in rows beside\r\nand above each other, like pigeon-holes in a dovecote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 130. Temple of Vimala Sah, Mount Abu. (From a Sketch by\r\nthe Author.)]\r\n\r\nExternally the temple is perfectly plain, and there is nothing to\r\nindicate the magnificence within, except the spire of the cell peeping\r\nover the plain wall, though even this is the most insignificant part of\r\nthe erection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 131. Pendant in Dome of Vimala Sah Temple at Abu. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe woodcut (No. 130) will give some idea of the arrangement of the\r\nporch, but it would require a far more extensive and elaborate drawing\r\nto convey a correct impression of its extreme beauty of detail and\r\ndiversity of design. The great pillars, as will be seen, are of the same\r\nheight as those of the smaller external porticos; and like them they\r\nfinish with the usual bracket-capital of the East; upon this an upper\r\ndwarf column or attic, if it may be so called, is placed to give them\r\nadditional height, and on these upper columns rest the great beams or\r\narchitraves which support the dome; as, however, the bearing is long, at\r\nleast in appearance, the weight is relieved by the curious angular strut\r\nor truss of white marble, mentioned above (p. 215), which, springing\r\nfrom the lower capital, seems to support the middle of the beam.\r\n\r\nThat this last feature is derived from some wooden or carpentry\r\noriginal, can, I think, scarcely be doubted; but in what manner it was\r\nfirst introduced into masonry construction is unknown; probably it might\r\neasily be discovered by a more careful examination of the buildings in\r\nthis neighbourhood. It continues as an architectural feature down almost\r\nto the present day, but gradually becoming more and more attenuated,\r\ntill at last, except in one example at Delhi, to be mentioned hereafter,\r\nit loses all its constructive significance as a supporting member, and\r\ndwindles into a mere ornament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 132. Pillars at Chandrávati. (From Tod’s ‘Western\r\nIndia.’)]\r\n\r\nOn the octagon so formed rests the dome, the springing of which is shown\r\nin Woodcut No. 130 (p. 236). In this instance a single block in the\r\nangles of the octagon suffices to introduce the circle. Above the second\r\nrow of ornaments sixteen pedestals are introduced supporting statues,\r\nand in the centre is a pendant of the most exquisite beauty; the whole\r\nis in white marble, and finished with a delicacy of detail and\r\nappropriateness of ornament which is probably unsurpassed by any similar\r\nexample to be found anywhere else. Those introduced by the Gothic\r\narchitects in Henry VII.’s chapel at Westminster, or at Oxford, are\r\ncoarse and clumsy in comparison. It is difficult, by any means of\r\nillustration, to convey a correct idea of the extreme beauty and\r\ndelicacy of these pendant ornaments, but the woodcut on page 237 (No.\r\n131) from a photograph will explain their form, even if it cannot\r\nreflect their beauty.\r\n\r\nAs before hinted, there never seems to have been any important town on\r\nMount Abu. It was too inaccessible for that purpose; but a few miles to\r\nthe southward on the plain are the remains of an extensive city, called\r\nChandrávati, where there are extensive remains of Jaina temples of the\r\nsame age and style as those on the mount, some of them probably more\r\nmodern, but still all of the best age. The place, however, was destroyed\r\nat the time of the Mahomedan conquest in the middle of the 14th century,\r\nand has since remained wholly deserted. It has in consequence been used\r\nas a quarry by the neighbouring towns and villages, so that few of its\r\nbuildings remain in a perfect state. The fragment, however, shown in\r\nWoodcut No. 132, may serve to illustrate the style in which they were\r\nerected, but as no two pillars are exactly alike, it would require\r\nhundreds to represent their infinite variety of detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARISNATH.\r\n\r\nThe highest point of the Bengal range of hills, south of Rajmahal, has\r\ncharacteristically been appropriated by the Jains as one of their most\r\nfavourite Tirths. Its original name apparently was Mount Síkhar, and no\r\nless than nineteen of their twenty-four Tirthankars are said to have\r\ndied and been buried there, among others Parswanatha, the last but one,\r\nand he consequently gave the hill the name it now bears.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no photographer has yet visited the hill, nor any one who\r\nwas able to discriminate between what was new and what old. Such\r\naccounts, however, as we have are by no means encouraging, and do not\r\nlead us to expect any very remarkable architectural remains. The temples\r\non the hill are numerous, but they seem all modern, or at least to have\r\nbeen so completely repaired in modern times that their more ancient\r\nfeatures cannot now be discerned. Something may also be due to the fact\r\nthat, since the revival of that religion, Bengal has never been\r\nessentially a Jaina country. The Pala dynasty of Bengal seem to have\r\nremained Buddhist nearly to the Mahomedan conquest (A.D. 1203), when\r\nthey seem suddenly to have dropped that religion and plunged headlong\r\ninto the Vaishnava and Saiva superstitions. Whether from this, or from\r\nsome other cause we cannot now explain, Jainism never seems to have\r\ntaken root in Bengal. At the time that it, with Buddhism, took its rise\r\nin the 6th century B.C., Behar was the intellectual and the political\r\ncentre of India, and Buddhism long held its sway in the country of its\r\nbirth. Before, however, Jainism became politically important, the centre\r\nof power had gravitated towards the West, and Jainism never seems to\r\nhave attained importance in the country where it first appeared. Were it\r\nnot for this, there seems little doubt but that Parisnath would have\r\nbeen more important in their eyes than Palitana or Girnar; but it is not\r\nso, and it consequently occupies only a very slight corner in an\r\narchitectural history of India.\r\n\r\nBesides the effect the Jains sought to obtain by grouping their temples\r\non hill-tops, the love of the picturesque, which they seem to have\r\ncultivated more than any other sect in India, led them to seek it in an\r\nexactly opposite direction. Some of their favourite Tirths are found in\r\ndeep and secluded valleys. One at Muktagiri, for instance, near\r\nGawelghur, is situated in a deep well-wooded valley, traversed by a\r\nstream that breaks in its course into numerous picturesque waterfalls.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this love of the picturesque is found at Sadri. In a\r\nremote valley piercing the western flank of the Aravulli, there is a\r\ngroup of temples, neither so numerous nor perhaps so picturesquely\r\nsituated as those at Muktagiri, but of more interest architecturally,\r\nand situated in a spot evidently selected for its natural beauties.\r\n\r\nThe principal temple here was erected by Khumbo Rana of Oudeypore. He\r\nseems to have been a zealous promoter of the Jaina religion, and during\r\nhis long and prosperous reign filled his country with beautiful\r\nbuildings, both civil and ecclesiastical. Amongst others, he built this\r\ntemple of Sadri, situated in a lonely and deserted glen, running into\r\nthe western slope of the Aravulli, below his favourite fort of\r\nKomulmeer. Notwithstanding long neglect, it is still nearly perfect, and\r\nis the most complicated and extensive Jaina temple I have myself ever\r\nhad an opportunity of inspecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 133. Plan of Temple at Sadri. (From a Plan by the\r\nAuthor.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nFrom the plan (Woodcut No. 133) it will be perceived that it is nearly\r\na square, 200 ft. by 225 ft., exclusive of the projections on each face.\r\nIn the centre stands the great shrine, not, however, occupied, as usual,\r\nby one cell, but by four; or rather four great niches, in each of which\r\nis placed a statue of Adinatha, or Rishabdeva, the first and greatest of\r\nthe Jaina saints. Above this are four other niches, similarly occupied,\r\nopening on the terraced roofs of the building. Near the four angles of\r\nthe court are four smaller shrines, and around them, or on each side of\r\nthem, are twenty domes, supported by about 420 columns; four of these\r\ndomes--the central ones of each group--are three storeys in height, and\r\ntower over the others; and one--that facing the principal entrance--is\r\nsupported by the very unusual number of sixteen columns, and is 36 ft.\r\nin diameter, the others being only 24 ft. Light is admitted to the\r\nbuilding by four uncovered courts, and the whole is surrounded by a\r\nrange of cells, many of them now unoccupied, each of which has a\r\npyramidal roof of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 134. View in the Temple at Sadri. (From a sketch by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\nThe internal effect of this forest of columns may be gathered from the\r\nview (Woodcut No. 134) taken across one of its courts; but it is\r\nimpossible that any view can reproduce the endless variety of\r\nperspective and the play of light and shade which results from the\r\ndisposition of the pillars, and of the domes, and from the mode in which\r\nthe light is introduced. A wonderful effect also results from the\r\nnumber of cells, most of them containing images of the Tirthankar, which\r\neverywhere meet the view. Besides the twelve in the central sikras there\r\nare eighty-six cells of very varied form and size surrounding the\r\ninterior, and all their façades more or less adorned with sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 135. External View of the Temple at Sadri.]\r\n\r\nThe general external effect of the Sadri Temple may be judged of by\r\nWoodcut No. 135; owing to its lofty basement, and the greater elevation\r\nof the principal domes, it gives a more favourable impression of a Jaina\r\ntemple than is usually the case--the greatest defect of these buildings\r\nas architectural designs being the want of ornament on their exterior\r\nfaces; this, however, is more generally the case in the older than in\r\nthe more modern temples.\r\n\r\nThe immense number of parts in the building, and their general\r\nsmallness, prevents its laying claim to anything like architectural\r\ngrandeur; but their variety, their beauty of detail--no two pillars in\r\nthe whole building being exactly alike--the grace with which they are\r\narranged, the tasteful admixture of domes of different heights with flat\r\nceilings, and the mode in which the light is introduced, combine to\r\nproduce an excellent effect. Indeed, I know of no other building in\r\nIndia, of the same class, that leaves so pleasing an impression, or\r\naffords so many hints for the graceful arrangement of columns in an\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nBesides its merits of design, its dimensions are by no means to be\r\ndespised; it covers altogether about 48,000 sq. ft., or nearly as much\r\nas one of our ordinary mediæval cathedrals, and, taking the basement\r\ninto account, is nearly of equal bulk; while in amount of labour and of\r\nsculptural decorations it far surpasses any.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUALIOR.\r\n\r\nThe rock at Gualior is, and must always have been, one of the most\r\nremarkable high places in Central India, and seems, as such, early to\r\nhave been appropriated by the Jains. Its position and its scarps,\r\nhowever, led to its being fortified, and, as one of the strongest places\r\nin India, it was attacked and taken by storm by Altumsh, the first\r\nMoslem emperor of Delhi, in A.D. 1232; and from that time till the fall\r\nof the Mogul empire it was held by the Mahomedans, or by Hindu kings\r\nsubject to their suzerainty. Under these circumstances, we should hardly\r\nexpect to find any extensive ancient Hindu remains in the place. There\r\nare, however, two very remarkable temples: one, known as the Sas Bahu,\r\nis generally understood to be a Jaina erection, and seems to be so\r\ndesignated and dedicated to Padmanatha, the sixth Tirthankar. General\r\nCunningham doubts this adscription,[273] in consequence of the walls\r\nbeing adorned with bas-reliefs, belonging certainly to the Vaishnava and\r\nSaiva sects. As in the case of the Aiwulli temple, it is extremely\r\ndifficult sometimes to say for what sect a temple was originally\r\nerected. In the times of which we are now speaking the sects had not\r\nbecome distinct and antagonistic as they afterwards were. The different\r\ndeities were, like those of the Greeks and Romans, parts of one\r\nreligion, which all shared in, and the temples were frequently of a most\r\npantheistic character. Be this as it may, this temple was finished\r\napparently in A.D. 1093, and, though dreadfully ruined, is still a most\r\npicturesque fragment. What remains is the cruciform porch of a temple\r\nwhich, when complete, measured 100 ft. from front to rear, and 63 ft.\r\nacross the arms of the porch. Of the sanctuary, with its sikra, nothing\r\nis left but the foundation; but the porch which is three storeys in\r\nheight, is constructively entire, though its details--and principally\r\nthose of its roof--are very much shattered (Woodcut No. 136, next page).\r\n\r\nAn older Jaina temple is described by General Cunningham, but as it was\r\nused as a mosque it is more likely that it is a Mahomedan building\r\nentirely, though made up of Jaina details.[274] The most striking part\r\nof the Jaina remains at Gualior are a series of caves or rock-cut\r\nsculptures that are excavated in the rock on all sides, and amount, when\r\ntaken together, to hardly less than a hundred, great and small. They\r\nare, however, very unlike the chaityas or viharas of the Buddhists,\r\nstill less do they resemble the Brahmanical caves, to be mentioned\r\nhereafter. Most of them are mere niches to contain statues, though some\r\nare cells that may have been originally intended\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 136. Jaina Temple at Gualior. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nfor residences. One curious fact regarding them is, that, according to\r\ninscriptions, they were all excavated within the short period of about\r\nthirty-three years, between A.D. 1441 and A.D. 1474. Some of the figures\r\nare of colossal size: one, for instance, is 57 ft. high, which is\r\ngreater than any other in the north of India, though in the south there\r\nare several which equal or surpass it, and, as free-standing figures are\r\nmore expressive and more difficult to execute.\r\n\r\n\r\nKHAJURÂHO.\r\n\r\nThe city of Khajurâho, the ancient capital of the Chandels, is situated\r\nabout 125 miles W.S.W. from Allahabad, and about 150 miles S.E. from\r\nGualior. It is now a wretched deserted place, but has in and around it a\r\ngroup of some thirty temples, which, so far as is at present known, are\r\nthe most beautiful in form as well as the most elegant in detail of any\r\nof the temples now standing in India.[275]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 137. Temple of Parswanatha at Khajurâho. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nSo far as can be made out from such inscriptions as exist, as well as\r\nfrom their style, it appears that all these temples, with two\r\nunimportant exceptions, were executed simultaneously and within the\r\nlimits of the 11th century: and, what is also curious, they seem to be,\r\nas nearly as possible, equally divided between the three religions. In\r\neach group there is one greater than the rest--a cathedral in\r\nfact--round which the smaller ones are clustered. In the Saiva group it\r\nis the Kandarya Mahadeva, of which a representation will be given\r\nfurther on; in the Vaishnava group it is the Ramachandra; and in the\r\nJaina the Jinanatha: all three so like one another that it requires very\r\ngreat familiarity with the photographs to distinguish the temple of one\r\nreligion from those of the others. It looks as if all had been built by\r\none prince, and by some arrangement that neither sect should surpass or\r\nbe jealous of the other. Either from this, or from some cause we do not\r\nquite understand, we lose here all the peculiarities we usually assign\r\nto Jaina temples of this age. The vimana or sikra is more important than\r\nthe porch. There are no courtyards with circumambient cells; no\r\nprominent domes, nor, in fact, anything that distinguishes Jaina from\r\nHindu architecture. If not under the sway of a single prince, they must\r\nhave been erected in an age of extreme toleration, and when any rivalry\r\nthat existed must only have been among the architects in trying who\r\ncould produce the most beautiful and most exquisitely adorned building.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of one of the three great temples will be given\r\nfurther on, a view of one of the smaller Jaina temples, that of\r\nParswanatha (Woodcut No. 137), will suffice to illustrate the style of\r\nart here employed. Its porch either never was added or has been removed\r\nand replaced in modern times by a brick abomination with pointed arches.\r\nThis, however, hardly interferes with the temple itself. There is\r\nnothing probably in Hindu architecture that surpasses the richness of\r\nits three-storeyed base combined with the extreme elegance of outline\r\nand delicate detail of the upper part.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 138. Chaonsat Jogini, Khajurâho. (From a Plan by Gen.\r\nCunningham.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe two exceptional temples above alluded to are, first, one called the\r\nChaonsat Jogini, or sixty-four female demons. It consists merely of a\r\ncourtyard, measuring 105 ft. by 60 ft. and surrounded by sixty-four\r\nsmall cells each of which is surmounted by a small spire, as shown in\r\nthe woodcut (No. 138). This is so essentially a Jaina arrangement (see\r\nTemple of Neminatha, for instance--Woodcut No. 126), that I have very\r\nlittle doubt this was originally a temple belonging to that religion.\r\nThe temple itself it is true has gone, but if it was as old as I\r\nbelieve it is,[276] nothing is more probable than that it was of wood,\r\nlike the old chaityas of the Buddhists, and has perished. If this view\r\nis correct it is probably the oldest Jaina temple yet discovered.\r\n\r\nThe other exceptional building is one of totally different character,\r\nand is as remarkable for its extreme elegance, even at Khajurâho, as the\r\nother is for its rudeness. It is called Ganthai, either from the bells\r\nsculptured on its pillars, or for some other cause unknown.\r\nUnfortunately it is only a fragment--a skeleton without flesh--a few\r\npillars of a double portico now standing alone without the walls that\r\nonce enclosed them (Woodcut No. 139, next page).\r\n\r\nFrom the form of several letters in an inscription, found among these\r\nruins, General Cunningham is inclined to believe that this temple may\r\nbelong to the sixth or seventh century of our era; which is, as near as\r\nmay be, the date I would ascribe to it, from the character of its\r\narchitectural details. But when at the same time from finding a Buddhist\r\nstatue and a short Buddhist inscription near them (p. 431), he is\r\ninclined to assign them to that religion, I beg leave to differ. Till,\r\nhowever, we know more than we now do of what the differences or\r\nsimilarities between the architecture of the Jains and Buddhists were at\r\nthe age when the temple was erected, it is impossible to argue the\r\nquestion. Almost all we know of Buddhist art at that time being derived\r\nfrom rock-cut examples, we have no pillars so slender as these, but it\r\nby no means follows that they may not have existed. They are not known\r\nhowever, while many Jaina examples are known so nearly like these as to\r\nestablish a strong presumption that they belong to that religion. The\r\nplan too of the building, so far as it can be made out, is utterly\r\nunlike anything we know that is Buddhist, but very similar to many that\r\ncertainly are Jaina.[277]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, these pillars are singularly graceful in their form,\r\nand elegant in their details, and belong to a style which, if there were\r\nmore examples of it, I would feel inclined to distinguish as the “Gupta\r\nstyle.” Except, however, some fragments at Erun and these pillars, we\r\nhave very little we can ascribe with anything like certainty to their\r\nage, 400 to 600. It would be most interesting, however, if something\r\nmore could be discovered, as it is the age when the great Vicramaditya\r\nlived, and when Hindu literature reached its highest point of\r\nperfection, and one Hindu temple of that age would consequently throw\r\nlight on many problems. Some Buddhist caves\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 139. The Ganthai, Khajurâho. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nand these Jaina fragments are all, however, that have yet come to light.\r\nThere seems, nevertheless, very little doubt that more exist in\r\nRajputana and Central India. At Gyraspore, near Bhilsa, 140 miles\r\nsouth-west from this, there is a group of columns arranged like these,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 140. Temple at Gyraspore. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nand like them deprived of their walls (Woodcut No. 140). In the Mokundra\r\npass there is a third example.[278] Was it that their walls were of\r\nsun-burnt bricks? or merely of small square stones which, being easily\r\nremoved, were utilised? My impression is, the latter was the case; but\r\nbe this as it may, these Gyraspore pillars are undoubtedly the remains\r\nof a Jaina edifice, but of an age considerably more modern than the\r\nGanthai. They can hardly under any circumstances be ascribed to an age\r\nanterior to the great civil war which commenced A.D. 650; but they are\r\nalmost certainly anterior to the great revival in the 10th century. In\r\nthe same town of Gyraspore is a very grand old temple apparently of\r\nabout the same age as these pillars. Its details at least are old, but\r\nit has been so ruined and repaired, and almost rebuilt, that it is\r\nextremely difficult to say what the form or purpose of the original\r\nerection may have been. There is also a toran of great beauty in the\r\nvillage, probably of the 11th century, and in fact throughout this\r\nregion there are numberless remains partially made known to us by\r\nphotography, but which if scientifically examined would probably suffice\r\nto fill up some of the largest gaps in our history, and especially in\r\nthat of Jaina architecture.\r\n\r\nAt Bhanghur for instance, in the Alwar territory, there are some very\r\nbeautiful Jaina temples. One in that neighbourhood, photographed by\r\nCaptain Impey, belongs to the 10th or 11th century, and is as beautiful\r\nas any of its class, either at Khajurâho or elsewhere, and near it again\r\nis a colossal Jaina image, called Nan Gûngi, some 20 ft. in height,\r\nwhich is apparently of the same age as the temples, and consequently\r\nsuperior to any of the colossi at Gualior or in the south of India.[279]\r\nThe Jains as a sect are hardly now known in Rajputana, and their temples\r\nare consequently neglected and falling into decay; though some of them,\r\nbeing of the best age and unrestored, are of extreme interest to the\r\ninvestigator of Indian art.\r\n\r\nAmong these, few are more pleasing than the little temple at Amwah, near\r\nAjunta (Woodcut No. 141). It is only a fragment. The sanctuary with its\r\nspire are gone, only the portico remaining; and its roof externally is\r\nso ruined, that its design can with difficulty be made out. Yet it\r\nstands so well on its stylobate, and the thirty-two small columns that\r\nsupport the roof externally are so well proportioned and so artistically\r\narranged, as to leave little to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of the interior is a dome 21 ft. in diameter,\r\nsupported on twelve richly carved pillars, with eight smaller ones\r\ninterspersed. Like all Indian domes, it is horizontal in construction,\r\nand consequently also in ornamentation, but as that is done here, it is\r\nas elegant or more so than the ribbed domes of western art. This one is\r\nplain in the centre, having no pendant--which, however, is one of the\r\nmost marked and pleasing features of Jaina domes, as may be gathered\r\nfrom the example in the temple of Vimala Sah at Mount Abu (Woodcut No.\r\n131).\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the Buddhists, though always employing circular\r\nroofs, and in all ages building topes with domical forms externally,\r\nnever seem to have attempted an internal dome, in stone at least. The\r\nHindus occasionally essayed a timid imitation of those of the Jains, but\r\nin no instance with much success. It is essentially a feature of Jaina\r\narchitecture, and almost exclusively so among the northern Indians,\r\nthough, why this particular sect should have adopted it, and why they,\r\nand they only, should have persevered in using it through so long a\r\nperiod, are questions we are not yet in a position to answer. It was an\r\nessential feature in the architecture of the Moslems before they came\r\ninto India, and they consequently eagerly seized on the domes of the\r\nJains when they first arrived there, and afterwards from them worked out\r\nthat domical style which is one of the most marked characteristics of\r\ntheir art in India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 141. Porch of Jaina Temple at Amwah, near Ajunta. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Major Gill.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting Jaina monuments of the age is the tower of\r\nSri Allat,[280] which still adorns the brow of Chittore (Woodcut No.\r\n142, next page), and is one probably of a great number of similar\r\nmonuments that may at one time have existed. From their form, however,\r\nthey are frail, and trees and human violence so easily overthrow them,\r\nthat we ought not to wonder that so few remain. This one is a singularly\r\nelegant specimen of its class, about 80 ft. in height, and adorned with\r\nsculpture and mouldings from the base to the summit.[281] An inscription\r\nonce existed at its base, which gave its date as A.D. 896, and though\r\nthe slab was detached this is so nearly the date we would arrive at from\r\nthe style that there seems little doubt that it\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 142. Jaina Tower of Sri Allat, Chittore. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nwas of that age. It was dedicated to Adnath, the first of the Jaina\r\nTirthankars, and his figure is repeated some hundreds of times on the\r\nface of the tower, but, so far as I could perceive, not that of any of\r\nthe other Jaina saints.\r\n\r\nThe temple in the foreground is of a more modern date, being put\r\ntogether principally of fragments of older buildings which have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 143. Tower of Victory erected by Khumbo Rana at Chittore.\r\n(From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nMost of the buildings above described belong to the first or great age\r\nof Jaina architecture, which extended down to about the year 1300, or\r\nperhaps a little after that. There seems then to have been a pause, at\r\nleast in the north of India, but a revival in the 15th century,\r\nespecially under the reign of Khumbo, one of the most powerful of the\r\nkings of the Mewar dynasty whose favourite capital was Chittore. His\r\nreign extended from 1418 to 1468, and it is to him that we owe the other\r\nof the two towers that still adorn the brow of Chittore. The older one\r\nhas just been described and illustrated. This one was erected as a\r\npillar of victory to commemorate his victory over Mahmúd of Malwa, in\r\nthe year 1439. It is therefore in Indian phraseology a _Jaya Stambha_,\r\nor pillar of victory, like that of Trajan at Rome, but in infinitely\r\nbetter taste as an architectural object than the Roman example, though\r\nin sculpture it may be inferior. As will be seen from the last woodcut\r\n(No. 143), it is nine storeys in height, each of which is distinctly\r\nmarked on the exterior. A stair in the centre communicates with each,\r\nand leads to the two upper storeys, which are open, and more ornamental\r\nthan those below. It is 30 ft. wide at the base, and more than 120 ft.\r\nin height; the whole being covered with architectural ornaments and\r\nsculptures to such an extent as to leave no plain parts, while at the\r\nsame time this mass of decoration is kept so subdued, that it in no way\r\ninterferes either with the outline or the general effect of the\r\npillar.[282]\r\n\r\nThe Mahomedans, as we shall afterwards see, adopted the plan of erecting\r\ntowers of victory to commemorate their exploits, but the most direct\r\nimitation was by the Chinese, whose nine-storeyed pagodas are almost\r\nliteral copies of these Jaina towers, translated into their own peculiar\r\nmode of expression.\r\n\r\nOther examples of this middle style of Jaina architecture are to be\r\nfound at Palitana, Girnar, and all the fashionable tirths of the Jainas,\r\nbut they have not yet been described or illustrated to that extent that\r\nenables us always to feel sure that what we see really belongs to this\r\ndate, and may not be a repair or a modification of some pre-existing\r\nbuilding. The Chaumúk--or Four-faced--at Palitana seems certainly to\r\nhave been erected in its present form in 1618, and is a very grand and\r\nbeautiful example of the style.[283] The temple too of Ardishur Bagavan,\r\nwhich is the largest single temple on that hill, seems to have assumed\r\nits present form in 1530,[284] though parts of it may be older. At\r\nleast, it is certain that an older temple stood on the spot, though not\r\nwith the fabulous antiquity ascribed to it by the priests, and\r\ncredulously repeated by Colonel Tod.[285]\r\n\r\nThough deficient in the extreme grace and elegance that characterised\r\nthe earlier examples, those of the middle style are bold and vigorous\r\nspecimens of the art, and still show an originality and an adherence to\r\nthe traditions of the style, and a freedom from any admixtures of\r\nforeign elements, which cannot be predicated of the modern style that\r\nsucceeded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMODERN JAINA STYLE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nJaina Temple, Delhi--Jaina Caves--Converted Mosques.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two places in northern India where the most modern styles of Jaina\r\narchitecture can probably be studied to most advantage are Sonaghur,\r\nnear Dutteah, in Bundelcund, and Muktagiri, near Gawelghur, in Berar.\r\nThe former is a granite hill, covered with large loose masses of\r\nprimitive rock, among which stand from eighty to one hundred temples of\r\nvarious shapes and sizes (Woodcut No. 144, p. 256). So far as can be\r\nmade out from photographs or drawings,[286] not one of these temples\r\nassumed its present form more than one hundred years ago. Their original\r\nfoundation may be earlier, but of that we know nothing, no traveller\r\nhaving yet enlightened us on the subject, nor explained how and when\r\nthis hill became a sacred mount.\r\n\r\nLike most Hindu buildings of the period, all these temples show very\r\ndistinctly the immense influence the Mahomedan style of architecture had\r\non that of the native styles at this age. Almost all the temples here\r\nare surmounted by the bulbous dome of the Moguls. The native sikra\r\nrarely appears, and the openings almost invariably take the form of the\r\nMahomedan foliated pointed arch. The result is picturesque, but not\r\nsatisfactory when looked closely into, and generally the details want\r\nthe purity and elegance that characterised the earlier examples.\r\n\r\nMuktagiri, instead of being situated on a hill, as the tirths of the\r\nJains usually are, is in a deep romantic valley, and the largest group\r\nof temples are situated on a platform at the foot of a waterfall that\r\nthunders down from the height of 60 ft. above them. Like those of\r\nSonaghur, they are all of the modern domed style, copied from Moslem\r\nart, and none of them, so far as can be ascertained from such\r\nillustrations as exist, remarkable for beauty of design. It would,\r\nhowever, be difficult to find another place in India where\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 144. View of Jaina Temples, Sonaghur, in Bundelcund.\r\n(From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 145. View of the Temple of Shet Huttising at Ahmedabad.\r\n(From a Photograph by Colonel Biggs.)]\r\n\r\narchitecture is so happily combined with the beauties of nature, and\r\nproduces so pleasing an impression on the lover of the picturesque,\r\nthough nearer acquaintance may result in disappointment to the\r\nantiquarian student of the style.\r\n\r\nIn remote parts of the empire, and especially in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the older shrines, this Mahomedan influence was much less felt than\r\nin the places just mentioned. The modern temples, for instance, at\r\nPalitana have domes, it is true, but they are much more directly the\r\nlineal descendants of the old Jaina domes than copies of those of the\r\nMoguls, and the foliated pointed arch rarely, if ever, occurs in the\r\nwalls of that old city. It requires, indeed, a practised eye to\r\ndiscriminate between what is old and what is new, and without the too\r\nmanifest inferiority of modern sculpture this would not always be easy\r\neven to the most accomplished antiquary.\r\n\r\nOne example must for the present suffice to show the effect aimed at by\r\nthis style in recent times, as well as to illustrate how little it has\r\ndegenerated from its ancient excellence. For, though this woodcut (No.\r\n145) does not prove it, there are photographs in this country which do\r\nexhibit the marvellous details of this temple in a manner not to be\r\nmistaken. It was erected about thirty years ago by Huttising, a rich\r\nJaina merchant, and dedicated to Dharmanath, the 15th Tirthankar. In\r\nthis instance the external porch between two circular towers is of great\r\nmagnificence and most elaborately ornamented, and leads to an outer\r\ncourt with sixteen cells on either side. In the centre of this is a\r\ndomed porch of the usual form, with twenty pillars (see Woodcut No.\r\n117). This leads to an inner porch of twenty-two pillars, two storeys in\r\nheight, and with a roof of a form very fashionable in modern Jaina\r\ntemples, though by no means remarkable for beauty, and difficult to\r\nrender intelligible without more illustration than it merits. This leads\r\nto a triple sanctuary, marked by three sikras, or spires, externally.\r\nBehind this is a smaller court with two groups of eight cells, one in\r\neach angle, with a larger cell in the centre, and two, still more\r\nimportant, at the point of junction between it and the first court. To\r\nthe eye of a European, unaccustomed to its forms, some of them may seem\r\nstrange; but its arrangement, at least, will probably be admitted to be\r\nvery perfect. Each part goes on increasing in dignity as we approach the\r\nsanctuary. The exterior expresses the interior more completely than even\r\na Gothic design; and whether looked at from its courts or from the\r\noutside, it possesses variety without confusion, and an appropriateness\r\nof every part to the purpose for which it was intended.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAINA TEMPLE, DELHI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 146. Upper part of Porch of Jaina Temple at Delhi. (From\r\na Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThere is one other example that certainly deserves notice before leaving\r\nthis branch of the subject, not only on account of its beauty, but its\r\nsingularity. In the preceding pages it has frequently been necessary to\r\nremark upon that curious wooden strut by which the Jains sought to\r\nrelieve the apparent weakness of the longer beams under their domes. It\r\noccurs at Abu (Woodcut No. 129), at Girnar, at Oudeypore, and many other\r\nplaces we shall have to remark upon in the sequel; everywhere, in fact,\r\nwhere an octagonal dome was used. It was also employed by the Hindus in\r\ntheir torans, and so favourite an ornament did it become that Akbar used\r\nit frequently both at Agra and Futtehpore Sikri. For centuries it\r\ncontinued without much alteration, but at last, in such an example as\r\nthe great Bowli at Bundi,[287] we find it degenerating into a mere\r\nornament. It was left, however, for a Jaina architect of the end of the\r\nlast or beginning of this century, in the Mahomedan city of Delhi, to\r\nsuggest a mode by which what was only conventionally beautiful might\r\nreally become an appropriate constructive part of lithic architecture.\r\n\r\nAs will be observed in the last cut (No. 146), the architect has had the\r\nhappy idea of filling in the whole of the back of the strut with pierced\r\nfoliaged tracery of the most exquisite device--thus turning what, though\r\nelegant, was one of the feeblest parts of Jaina design into a thoroughly\r\nconstructive stone bracket; one of the most pleasing to be found in\r\nIndian architecture, and doing this while preserving all its traditional\r\nassociations. The pillars, too, that support these brackets are of great\r\nelegance and constructive propriety, and the whole makes up as elegant a\r\npiece of architectural design as any certainly of its age. The weak part\r\nof the composition is the dome. It is elegant, but too conventional. It\r\nno longer has any constructive propriety, but has become a mere\r\nornament. It is not difficult, however, to see why natives should admire\r\nand adopt it. When the eyes of a nation have been educated by a gradual\r\nsuccession of changes in any architectural object, persevered in through\r\nfive or six centuries, the taste becomes so accustomed to believe the\r\nlast fashion to be the best, the change has been so gradual, that people\r\nforget how far they are straying from the true path. The European, who\r\nhas not been so educated, sees only the result, without having followed\r\nthe steps by which it has been so reached, and is shocked to find how\r\nfar it has deviated from the form of a true dome of construction, and,\r\nfinding it also unfamiliar, condemns it. So, indeed, it is with\r\nnine-tenths of the ornaments of Hindu architecture. Few among us are\r\naware how much education has had to do with their admiration of\r\nclassical or mediæval art, and few, consequently, perceive how much\r\ntheir condemnation of Indian forms arises from this very want of gradual\r\nand appropriate education.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAINA CAVES.\r\n\r\nThe Jains never were great cave-diggers; the nature of their religion\r\ndid not require great assembly halls like the chaityas of the Buddhists,\r\nnor was it necessary that their priests should live apart in monasteries\r\nlike those of their predecessors, and their ceremonial affected light\r\nand air rather than gloom or mystery. Like the Brahmans, however, during\r\nthe stage of transition they could hardly refuse entirely to follow a\r\nfashion set by the Buddhists, to which all India had been accustomed for\r\nnearly 1000 years, and which was in reality a singularly impressive form\r\nof temple-building. We find them, consequently, excavating caves at\r\nKhandagiri, near Cuttack, in succession to the older ones in the\r\nUdayagiri. At Ellora they followed immediately after the Buddhists; and\r\nelsewhere there are caves which may be claimed by either religion, so\r\nlike are they to each other in their transitional state.\r\n\r\nGreat light has recently been thrown on the history of these excavations\r\nby the discovery of a Jaina cave at Badami, in Dharwar, with a\r\nwell-ascertained date.[288] There is no inscription on the cave itself,\r\nbut there are three other Brahmanical caves in the same place, one of\r\nwhich has an inscription with an undoubted date, 500 Saka or A.D. 579;\r\nand all four caves are so like one another in style that they must have\r\nbeen excavated within the same century. The Jaina cave is probably the\r\nmost modern; but if we take the year A.D. 650 as a medium date, we may\r\nprobably consider it as certain within an error of twenty years either\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe cave itself is very small, only 31 ft. across and about 19 ft. deep,\r\nand it is a little uncertain whether the groups of figures at either end\r\nof the verandah are integral, or whether they may not have been added at\r\nsome subsequent period. The inner groups, however, are of the age of the\r\ncave, and the architecture is unaltered, and thus becomes a fixed\r\nstanding-point for comparison with other examples; and when we come to\r\ncompare it with the groups known as the Indra Subha and Jaganât Subha at\r\nEllora, we cannot hesitate to ascribe them to about the same age.\r\nHitherto, the Jaina group at Ellora has been considered as the most\r\nmodern there: an impression arising partly from the character of the\r\nsculptures themselves, which are neither purely Jaina nor purely\r\nHindu--more, however, from the extreme difficulty of comparing rock-cut\r\nexamples with structural ones. Our knowledge of the architecture of\r\ntemples is, in nine cases out of ten, derived from their external forms,\r\nto which the interiors are quite subordinate. Cave-temples, however,\r\nhave practically no exteriors, and at the utmost façades modified to\r\nadmit more light than is usual in structural edifices, and then\r\nstrengthened and modified so as to suit rock-cut architecture. As no\r\nancient Jaina temple hitherto known had a dated inscription upon it, nor\r\na tolerably authenticated history, it is no wonder that guesses might be\r\nwide of the truth. Now, however, that we know positively the age of one\r\nexample, all this can be rectified, and there seems no doubt that all\r\nthe Indra Subha group were finished before the cataclysm--say before\r\nA.D. 750.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 147. Entrance to the Indra Subha Cave at Ellora. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nWhen with this new light we come to examine with care the architecture\r\nof these façades, we find the Ellora group exhibits an extraordinary\r\naffinity with the southern style. The little detached shrine in the\r\ncourtyard of the Indra Subha, and the gateway shown in the above woodcut\r\n(No. 147), are as essentially Dravidian in style as the Kylas itself,\r\nand, like many of the details of these caves, so nearly identical that\r\nthey cannot possibly be distant in date. May we, therefore, assume from\r\nthis that the Chalukyan kingdom of Kalian, in the 7th century of our\r\nera, extended from Ellora on the north to Badami on the south, and that\r\nall these rock-cut examples, with the temple at Aiwulli (Woodcut No.\r\n120), were excavated or erected under their auspices?\r\n\r\nTo this we shall have occasion to revert presently, when describing the\r\nDravidian style; but meanwhile it may be assumed that this theory\r\nrepresents the facts of the case more nearly than any hitherto brought\r\nforward. The Chalukyas of Kalian were situated on the border-line,\r\nhalfway between the north and the south, and they, or their subjects,\r\nseemed to have practised the styles of architecture belonging to those\r\ntwo divisions indiscriminately--it might almost be said alternately--and\r\nwe consequently find them mixed up here and at Dhumnar in a manner that\r\nis most puzzling.\r\n\r\nThe last king of this race, Vicramaditya II., ascended the throne A.D.\r\n733,[289] and died probably in or about the year A.D. 750. It was\r\nprobably, therefore, before that date that these Dravidian temple-forms\r\nwere introduced by the Jains at Ellora. The Kylas and other great Saiva\r\ntemples were, I believe, excavated by the Cheras or Cholas, who were the\r\nDravidian races, and, if I mistake not, superseded the Chalukyas on the\r\ndeath of Vicramaditya, their last king, and carried their power, as will\r\npresently be explained, up to the Nerbudda. The Jains, however, seem to\r\nhave been earlier in the field, and this little shrine in the court of\r\nthe Indra Subha looks very much as if it may have been the model that\r\nsuggested the Kylas, the greatest of all Indian rock-cut examples of its\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERTED MOSQUES.\r\n\r\nAnother form in which we can study the architecture of the Jains in the\r\nnorth of India is the courtyards of the early mosques which the\r\nMahomedans erected on their first entry into India. So essentially do\r\nsome of these retain their former features that it might be convenient\r\nto describe them here. It is doubtful, however, in some instances\r\nwhether the pillars are--some or all of them--in their original\r\nposition, or to what extent they have been altered or eked out by the\r\nconquerors. Be this as it may, for our present purposes the one fact\r\nthat is certain is, that none of them are now Jaina temples. All are\r\nMahomedan mosques, and it will, therefore, be more logical, as well as\r\nmore convenient, to group them with the latter rather than with the\r\nformer class of buildings.\r\n\r\nWere it not for this, the Arhaí-dín-ka Jomphra, at Ajmir--so\r\ncalled--might be, and has been, described as a Jaina temple.[290] So\r\nmight a great part of the mosque at the Kutub, Delhi. That at Canouge,\r\nhowever, was originally a rearrangement, and has been much altered since\r\nI knew it; that at Dhar, near Mandu, is of comparatively recent date;\r\nwhile the Jaina pillars, so frequently used at Ahmedabad in the 15th\r\ncentury, are all imported, and used in positions for which they never\r\nwere intended.\r\n\r\nThe astylar temples of the Hindus were useless to the Moslems except as\r\nquarries--a purpose to which they were frequently applied; but the light\r\ncolumnar style of the Jains not only supplied materials more easily\r\nadapted to their purposes, but furnished hints of which the Moslem\r\narchitects were not slow to avail themselves. The architecture of\r\nAhmedabad, for instance (A.D. 1396 to 1572), is derived far more\r\ndirectly from the Jaina than from any style familiar to their\r\nco-religionists in any other part of the world. The same may be said of\r\nthat of Juanpore, though in the last-named city there is hardly a stone\r\nthat can be said to be derived direct from any previously existing\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe process by which this conversion of a Jaina temple to a Moslem\r\nmosque was effected will be easily understood by referring to the plan\r\nof that of Vimala Sah, on Mount Abu (Woodcut No. 129, p. 235). By\r\nremoving the principal cell and its porch from the centre of the court,\r\nand building up the entrances of the cells that surround it, a courtyard\r\nwas at once obtained, surrounded by a double colonnade, which always was\r\nthe typical form of a mosque. Still one essential feature was wanting--a\r\nmore important side towards Mecca; this they easily obtained by removing\r\nthe smaller pillars from that side, and re-erecting in their place the\r\nlarger pillars of the porch, with their dome in the centre; and, if\r\nthere were two smaller domes, by placing one of them at each end. Thus,\r\nwithout a single new column or carved stone being required, they\r\nobtained a mosque which, for convenience and beauty, was unsurpassed by\r\nanything they afterwards erected from their own original designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nJAINA STYLE IN SOUTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nBettus--Bastis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good deal has been done lately in the way of photographing the\r\nmonuments of the Jains in southern India, but nothing, so far as I am\r\naware, has recently been written that gives any statistical account of\r\ntheir present position in the country, nor any information when their\r\nestablishments were first formed in Mysore and Canara.[291] What is even\r\nmore to be regretted for our present purposes is, that no plans have\r\nbeen made of their buildings and no architectural details drawn, so that\r\naltogether our knowledge of the subject is somewhat superficial; but it\r\nis interesting from its extent, and curious from the unexpected\r\nrelationship it reveals with other styles and countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Burgess’s report has proved that Jains did exist at Aiwulli and\r\nBadami (_supra_, p. 261) as early as the end of the 6th, or certainly in\r\nthe 7th century; but after that there is a pause or break of four or\r\nfive centuries, when the style reappears in strength at Belgaon and in\r\nthat neighbourhood in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the same manner\r\nsouthern Jains seem to have pressed northward as far as Ellora in the\r\n7th or 8th century, taking their Dravidian style with them (_supra_, p.\r\n261); but there again we stop, in so far as any direct evidence has been\r\nfound, till the great outburst of Jaina magnificence at the end of the\r\n10th century, which then seems to have continued in the north till\r\ndisturbed by the Mahomedan invasion. It is by no means clear whether the\r\ndestruction of their temples, as at Ajmir and Delhi, and the persecution\r\nof their faith generally, may not have been the cause that induced the\r\nJains to migrate southward. It certainly was about that time when its\r\ngreatest development in the south took place. Of course it existed there\r\nbefore, and some of the early kings of Hoisala Bellalas were Jains\r\nnominally at least. All their buildings, however, so far as we know\r\nthem, either at Somnathpur, Bellûr, or Hullabîd, belong to the Vaishnava\r\nor Saiva faiths.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which is perplexing, or at least unusual, is, that\r\nthe Jainism of the south does not seem to be founded on any pre-existing\r\nBuddhism. No important Buddhist remains have yet been discovered south\r\nof Poona, with the single exception of the Amravati tope and a few caves\r\nin its immediate neighbourhood. More may probably exist, or have\r\nexisted; but the rapid manner in which Hiouen Thsang passes through\r\nthese countries, and the slight mention he makes of Buddhist\r\nestablishments,[292] render it doubtful if any important communities\r\nbelonging to that faith existed in Dravida-desa.[293] In the capital,\r\nindeed, Konkanapura, which seems to have been situated somewhere in\r\nNorthern Mysore, there may have been some extensive Buddhist\r\nestablishments; but as they have left no memorials on the spot, and no\r\nmonuments, we may be allowed to suspect they were not so important as he\r\ndescribes them to be in the 7th century.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there was no Buddhism in the south on which Jainism could\r\nbe based, there are everywhere traces of the prevalence of Serpent\r\nworship in those districts where the religion of Jaina now prevails.\r\nSculptured serpents, with many heads and in all their conventional\r\nforms, are found everywhere about and in the temples; and Subramuni,\r\nbelow the Ghâts, is still one of the principal seats of Serpent worship\r\nin southern India. It is not, unfortunately, easy to say how far Tree\r\nworship was mixed up with the latter faith. Trees perish more easily and\r\nquickly than sculptured stones, and when the worship ceases its traces\r\ndisappear more readily. There are some indications that it did prevail\r\nhere also, but, till purposely inquired after, it is impossible to say\r\nto what extent or how far the indications can be relied upon. Enough,\r\nhowever, is known, even now, to justify the assertion that Tree and\r\nSerpent worship did exist antecedently in those districts in which\r\nJainism prevailed in the south, but did not appear in the more purely\r\nDravidian countries where the people are now devoted to the worship of\r\nSiva and the Hindu Pantheon.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter appears to be, that until the numerous Jaina\r\ninscriptions which exist everywhere in the south are collected and\r\ntranslated, and until plans are made of their buildings, and statistics\r\ncollected about them, it is idle to speculate either about the time of\r\nthe introduction of Jainism into the south, or its vicissitudes during\r\nits existence there. It is a task which, it is to be feared, few in that\r\nPresidency are capable of undertaking, and that fewer still are willing\r\nto devote the time and labour requisite for its successful\r\naccomplishment; but it is worthy of being attempted, for, if\r\nsuccessfully carried out, it would add to our scant stores of knowledge\r\none of the most interesting chapters still available for the religious\r\nand artistic history of the people of India.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTUS.\r\n\r\nThe first peculiarity that strikes one as distinguishing the Jaina\r\narchitecture of the south from that of the north, is the division of the\r\nsouthern temples into two classes, called Bastis and Bettus.[294] The\r\nformer are temples in the usual acceptance of the word, as understood in\r\nthe north, and, as there, always containing an image of one of the\r\ntwenty-four Tirthankars, which is the object there worshipped. The\r\nlatter are unknown in the north; and are courtyards open to the sky and\r\ncontaining images, not of a Tirthankar, but of a Gômati or Gômata Raja\r\nso called, though who he was, and why worshipped, no one seems exactly\r\nto know. He is not known to the Jains in the north. All the images on\r\nthe rock at Gualior are of one or other of the Tirthankars, and even the\r\nUlwar colossus, Nan Gûngi, can hardly be identified with these southern\r\nimages. It looks almost as if some vague tradition of Gautama Buddha the\r\nprince, as distinguished from Mahavira the last of the Tirthankars, and\r\nwho is said to have been his preceptor, had in late times penetrated to\r\nthe south, and given rise to this peculiar form. Be this, however, as it\r\nmay, the images of this king or Jaina saint are among the most\r\nremarkable works of native art in the south of India. Three of them are\r\nknown, and have long been known to Europeans,[295] and it is doubtful if\r\nany more exist. They are too remarkable objects not to attract the\r\nattention of even the most indifferent Saxon. That at Sravana Belgula\r\nattracted the attention of the late Duke of Wellington when, as Sir A.\r\nWellesley, he commanded a division at the siege of Seringapatam. He,\r\nlike all those who followed him, was astonished at the amount of labour\r\nsuch a work must have entailed, and puzzled to know whether it was a\r\npart of the hill or had been moved to the spot where it now stands. The\r\nformer is the more probable theory. The hill called Indra Giri is one\r\nmass of granite about 400 ft. in height, and probably had a mass or Tor\r\nstanding on its summit--either a part of the subjacent mass or lying on\r\nit. This the Jains undertook to fashion into a statue 70 ft. 3 in. in\r\nheight, and have achieved it with marvellous success. The task of\r\ncarving a rock standing in its place the Hindu mind never would have\r\nshrunk from, had it even been twice the size; but to move such a mass up\r\nthe steep smooth side of the hill seems a labour beyond their power,\r\neven with all their skill in concentrating masses of men on a single\r\npoint. Whether, however, the rock was found _in situ_ or was moved,\r\nnothing grander or more imposing exists anywhere out of Egypt, and even\r\nthere no known statue surpasses it in height, though, it must be\r\nconfessed, they do excel it in the perfection of art they exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe image at Kârkala, which is next--its size being 41 ft. 5 in. in\r\nheight, and weighs about 80 tons[296]--was moved certainly to the place\r\nwhere it now stands, and its date luckily is engraved upon it, A.D.\r\n1432, and it is so like that at Belgula, that there can hardly be much\r\ndifference between their ages.\r\n\r\nThe third at Yannûr is smaller, about 35 ft. high apparently,[297] but\r\nfrom the style of art in which it is executed it is probably the oldest\r\nof the three (Woodcut No. 148).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 148. Colossal Statue at Yannûr. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAll these three figures belong to the Digambara sect of Jains, being\r\nentirely naked; and all possess the peculiarity of having twigs of the\r\nBo-tree of Sakya Muni--the _Ficus religiosa_--twisted round their arms\r\nand legs in a manner found nowhere else, and in having serpents at\r\ntheir feet. In the Jaina cave at Badami a similar figure has two\r\nserpents wound round its arms and legs precisely as these twigs are\r\nhere, and the Bo-tree is relegated to the background.[298] This figure,\r\nthough probably not so old as the cave in which it is found--say A.D.\r\n600--is certainly much older than the three great monoliths, and with\r\nother indications renders it probable that the greater prominence of the\r\nserpent or the tree is no unfair indication of the relative age of any\r\ntwo statues. In that at Yannûr, the serpents are three-headed and very\r\nprominent beside the statue, on steles alongside the legs. At Kârkala\r\nthey are less so,[299] and at Belgula they are relegated to the base,\r\nwhile the tree with its leaves is there thickly spread over the whole\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASTIS.\r\n\r\nThe principal group of the Bastis of the Jains, at present known at\r\nleast, above the Ghâts, is that at Sravana Belgula. There are there two\r\nhills--the Indragiri, on whose summit the colossal image just described\r\nstands, and dominates the plain. On a shoulder of the other, called\r\nChandragiri, stand the Bastis, fifteen in number. As might be expected\r\nfrom their situation, they are all of the Dravidian style of\r\narchitecture, and are consequently built in gradually receding stories,\r\neach of which is ornamented with small simulated cells, as was explained\r\nabove, p. 134, and will be more fully described presently. No instance\r\noccurs among them of the curvilinear sikra or spire, which is universal\r\nwith the northern Jains, except in the instance of Ellora above alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no one has yet thought it worth while to make a plan of\r\nany of these temples, nor even to describe them in detail, so that it is\r\ndifficult to feel sure of anything regarding them. The following woodcut\r\n(No. 149) conveys, however, an idea of the general external appearance,\r\nwhich is more ornamental than that of the generality of northern Jaina\r\ntemples. The outer wall of those in the north is almost always quite\r\nplain. The southern ones are as generally ornamented with pilasters and\r\ncrowned with a row of ornamental cells. Inside is a court probably\r\nsquare and surrounded by cloisters, at the back of which rises the\r\nvimana over the cell, which contains the principal image of the\r\nTirthankar. It always is surmounted by a small dome, as is universally\r\nthe case with every vimana in Dravidian architecture, instead of with\r\nthe mysterious amalaka ornament of northern sikras.\r\n\r\nIt may be a vain speculation, but it seems impossible to look at this\r\nwoodcut, and not be struck with its resemblance to the temples of\r\nsouthern Babylonia (Woodcuts Nos. 47 and 48 of vol. i.). The same\r\ndivision into stories, with their cells; the backward position of the\r\ntemple itself; the panelled or pilastered basement, are all points of\r\nresemblance it seems difficult to regard as purely accidental. The\r\ndistance of time would seem to bar such an idea, but the combinations of\r\nmen with bulls and lions, and the many similarities between the\r\nPantheons of Babylonia and India, render the fact of the architecture of\r\nthe one country influencing that of the other, far from being\r\nimpossible, though by some it may be considered improbable. I have long\r\ntried to shake off the idea as an untenable hypothesis, but every time I\r\nreturn to the study of the subject, its likelihood recurs with\r\nincreasing strength. Its verification, however, or refutation must\r\ndepend on our possessing greater knowledge of the subject than we do at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 149. Jaina Basti at Sravana Belgula. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we descend the Ghâts into Canara, or the Tulava country, we come on\r\na totally different state of matters. Jainism is the religion of the\r\ncountry, and all or nearly all the temples belong to this sect, but\r\ntheir architecture is neither the Dravidian style of the south, nor that\r\nof northern India, and indeed is not known to exist anywhere else in\r\nIndia Proper, but recurs with all its peculiarities in Nepal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 150. Jaina Temple at Moodbidri. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe annexed two views (Woodcuts Nos. 150-51) of one of the largest of\r\nthese temples, found at a place called Moodbidri,[300] in Canara, will\r\ngive a fair idea of the general aspect of these temples externally. They\r\nare much plainer than Hindu temples usually are. The pillars look like\r\nlogs of wood with the angles partially chamfered off, so as to make them\r\noctagons, and the sloping roofs of the verandahs are so evidently\r\nwooden that the style itself cannot be far removed from a wooden\r\noriginal. In many places, indeed, below the Ghâts the temples are still\r\nwholly constructed in wood without any admixture of stone, and almost\r\nall the features of the Moodbidri temples may be found in wood at the\r\npresent day. The blinds between the pillars, which are there executed in\r\nstone, are found in wood in every city in India, and with very little\r\nvariation are used by Europeans in Calcutta to a greater extent,\r\nperhaps, than they were ever used by the natives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 151. Jaina Temple at Moodbidri. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe feature, however, which presents the greatest resemblance to the\r\nnorthern styles, is the reverse slope of the eaves above the verandah. I\r\nam not aware of its existence anywhere else south of Nepal, and it is so\r\npeculiar that it is much more likely to have been copied than\r\nre-invented.\r\n\r\nThe interiors of the Canarese temples are in marked contrast with the\r\nplainness of the exteriors. Nothing can exceed the richness or the\r\nvariety with which they are carved. No two pillars seem alike, and many\r\nare ornamented to an extent that may seem almost fantastic. This again\r\nseems an indication of their recent descent from a wooden\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 152. Pillar in Temple, Moodbidri. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\noriginal. Long habit of using stone would have sobered their forms, and\r\nthey are now of great thickness--it may even be said massiveness--and\r\nthis is just such an excess of strength as a people accustomed to wooden\r\narchitecture would employ when first called upon to replace in stone\r\nsupports which in wood would have appeared necessary to carry a heavy\r\nstone roof (Woodcut No. 152, p. 273).\r\n\r\nTheir plans, as far as can be made out from photographs, are those usual\r\nin Jaina temples--spacious, well-lighted porches, leading to a dark cell\r\nin which the image of one of the Tirthankars is placed, naked of course,\r\nas all the southern Jains seem to have belonged to the Digambara sect.\r\n\r\nTheir age has not yet been determined with certainty, as no inscriptions\r\nfrom them have yet been published or translated, but, in so far as\r\ninformation can be gathered from the various sources available, three or\r\nfour hundred years seems to be about the limit of their age. Some may go\r\nback as far as 1300, but it looks as if the kingdom of the Zamorin was\r\nat the height of its prosperity about the time it was first visited by\r\nthe Portuguese, and that the finest temples may belong to that age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 153. Pavilion at Gurusankerry. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nBesides the greater temples, there are several varieties of smaller ones\r\nwhich seem peculiar to the style--such, for instance, as the\r\nfive-pillared shrine at Gurusankerry (Woodcut No. 153). Four-pillared\r\npavilions are not uncommon in front of Hindu temples in the south. There\r\nis a very famous one, for instance, on the opposite shore of India at\r\nMahavellipore, but not one, that I know of, with five pillars, or with\r\naccess to the upper chambers. There are three of these upper chambers in\r\nthis instance--the two lower now closed, but apparently originally open;\r\nbut to what use they were devoted, or what purpose they were intended to\r\nsubserve, is by no means clear. At the base of the temple are a number\r\nof stones bearing images of serpents; seven or eight are now there, and\r\nthe serpents themselves are some with one, others three, five, or seven\r\nheads. It may be that this is a serpent temple, and that the living form\r\nof this strange divinity, when alive, inhabited the upper storey. But\r\nit may also be, that the stones were brought there in modern times, so\r\nthat till some one on the spot will take the trouble to ascertain the\r\nfacts of the case, it is not safe to speculate regarding them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 154. Tombs of Priests, Moodbidri. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nA third feature, even more characteristic of the style, is found in the\r\ntombs of the priests, a large number of which are found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Moodbidri. Three of these are illustrated in the\r\nannexed Woodcut (No. 154). They vary much in size and magnificence, some\r\nbeing from three to five or seven storeys in height, but they are not,\r\nlike the storeys of Dravidian temples, ornamented with simulated cells\r\nand finishing with domical roofs. The division of each storey is a\r\nsloping roof, like those of the pagodas at Katmandhu, and in China or\r\nThibet. In India they are quite anomalous. In the first place, no tombs\r\nof priests are known to exist anywhere else, and their forms, too, are\r\nquite unlike any other building now known to be standing in any other\r\npart of India.\r\n\r\nThough not the grandest, certainly the most elegant and graceful objects\r\nto be found in Canara belonging to the Jaina style of architecture are\r\nthe stambhas, which are found attached to almost every temple. These are\r\nnot, however, peculiar to the place or style. They are used sometimes by\r\nthe Hindus, but then generally as deepdans, or lamp-bearing pillars, and\r\nin that case have some arrangement for exhibiting light from their\r\nsummit. With the Jains this does not appear ever to have been the case.\r\nTheir pillars are the lineal descendants of those of the Buddhists,\r\nwhich bore either emblems or statues--generally the former--or figures\r\nof animals; with the Jains or Vaishnavas they as generally bore statues.\r\nBe this as it may, they seem nowhere to have been so frequent or so\r\nelaborately adorned as among the Jains in the south, and especially in\r\nCanara. The example here given of one at Gurusankerry is a fair average\r\nspecimen of its class (Woodcut No. 155). The sub-base is square and\r\nspreading; the base itself square, changing into an octagon, and thence\r\ninto a polygonal figure approaching a circle; and above a wide-spreading\r\ncapital of most elaborate design. To many this may at first sight appear\r\ntop-heavy, but it is not so in reality. If you erect a pillar at all, it\r\nought to have something to carry. Those we erect are copied from pillars\r\nmeant to support architraves, and are absurd solecisms when merely\r\nsupporting statues; we have, however, got accustomed to them, and our\r\neye is offended if anything better proportioned to the work to be done\r\nis proposed; but, looking at the breadth of the base and the strength of\r\nthe shaft, anything less than here exhibited would be found\r\ndisproportionately small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 155. Stambha at Gurusankerry. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nOn the lower or square part of these stambhas, as well as on the pillars\r\ninside the temples at Moodbidri (Woodcut No. 152) and elsewhere in\r\nCanara, we find that curious interlaced basket-pattern, which is so\r\nfamiliar to us from Irish manuscripts or the ornaments on Irish crosses.\r\nAs pointed out in a former volume (ii. p. 475), it is equally common in\r\nArmenia, and can be traced up the valley of the Danube into central\r\nEurope; but how it got to the west coast of India we do not know, nor\r\nhave we, so far as I know, any indication on which we can rely for its\r\nintroduction. There was at all times for the last fifteen centuries a\r\nlarge body of Christians established on this coast who were in\r\nconnection with Persia and Syria, and are so now. It would be strange,\r\nindeed, if it were from them the Jains obtained this device. But\r\nstranger things have happened than even this in the history of\r\narchitecture, and few things can be more interesting when the means\r\nexist of tracing any connection that may be detected between them.\r\n\r\nIf any one wished to select one feature of Indian architecture which\r\nwould illustrate its rise and progress, as well as its perfection and\r\nweakness, there are probably no objects more suited for this purpose\r\nthan these stambhas, or free-standing pillars. They are found of all\r\nages, from the simple and monolithic lâts which Asoka set up to bear\r\ninscriptions or emblems, some 250 years B.C. down to the seventeenth or\r\nperhaps even eighteenth century of our era. During these 2000 years they\r\nwere erected first by the Buddhists, then by the Jains, and occasionally\r\nby the other sects in all parts of India; and notwithstanding their\r\ninherent frailty, some fifty--it may be a hundred--are known to be still\r\nstanding. After the first and most simple, erected by Asoka, it may be\r\nsafely asserted that no two are alike though all bear strongly the\r\nimpress of the age in which they were erected, and all are thoroughly\r\noriginal and Indian in design.\r\n\r\nIt may be owing to the styloclastic propensities of the Moslems that\r\nthese pillars are not found so frequently where they have held sway, as\r\nin the remoter parts of India; but, whether from this cause or not, they\r\nseem to be more frequent in Canara and among the southern Jains than in\r\nany other part of India. In the north we depend mainly on the rock-cut\r\nexamples for their forms, but they are so usual there that it seems\r\nhardly doubtful they were relatively as frequent in connection with\r\nstructural examples, though these have generally disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that there may be some connection between these\r\nstambhas and the obelisks of the Egyptians. The time that elapsed,\r\nhowever, between the erection of the monoliths in the valley of the Nile\r\nand those in India seems to render this doubtful, though they were\r\ncertainly erected for similar purposes and occupied the same position\r\nrelatively to the temples. When, however, we look at the vast difference\r\nbetween their designs, it is evident, even assuming a connection, that\r\nvast ages must have elapsed before the plain straight-lined forms of the\r\nobelisks could have been changed into the complicated and airy forms of\r\nthe Jaina stambhas. The two are the Alpha and Omega of architectural\r\ndesign--the older, simple and severe, beyond any other examples of\r\npurely ornamental objects; the latter, more varied and more highly\r\nornamented than almost any others of their class that can be named.\r\n\r\nWe are hardly yet in a position to push these speculations to their\r\nlegitimate issue, and must wait for further information before any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion can be derived from them; but meanwhile it may\r\nbe pointed out how curiously characteristic of Indian art it is that\r\nthis little remote province of Tulava, or Canara, should have a style of\r\nits own, differing essentially from that found in any other part of the\r\nIndian continent, but still having affinities with outlying and distant\r\ncountries, with which one would hardly suspect any connection but for\r\nthe indications derived from their architecture.\r\n\r\nI cannot offer even a plausible conjecture how or at what time a\r\nconnection existed between Nepal and Thibet and Canara; but I cannot\r\ndoubt that such was the case, and that some one with better\r\nopportunities will hereafter explain what now seems so mysterious. It is\r\nless difficult to conjecture how early and frequent intercourse may have\r\nexisted between the Persian Gulf and the western shores of India, and\r\nhow the relations between these two countries may have been so intimate\r\nas to account for the amount of Assyrian, or, as we now call them\r\nArmenian, forms we now find in the Jaina architecture of southern India,\r\nespecially in that below the Ghâts. It will require, however, that the\r\nIndian branch of the subject should be much more fully and more\r\nscientifically investigated than has hitherto been the case before it is\r\nworth while to do more than indicate how rich a field lies open to\r\nreward the industry of any future explorer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of\r\n\r\nINDIA,\r\n\r\nShewing the Principal\r\n\r\nINDO-ARYAN\r\n\r\nCHALUKYAN & DRAVIDIAN\r\n\r\nLOCALITIES.\r\n\r\nVincent Brooks, Day & Son lith.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE IN THE HIMALAYAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nKASHMIR.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nTemples--Marttand--Avantipore--Bhaniyar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough neither so beautiful in itself, nor so interesting either from\r\nan artistic or historical point of view as many others, the architecture\r\nof the valley of Kashmir has attracted more attention in modern times\r\nthan that of any other styles in India, and a greater number of special\r\ntreatises have been written regarding it than are devoted to all the\r\nother styles put together. This arises partly from the beauty of the\r\nvalley in which the Kashmiri temples are situated. The beauty of its\r\nscenery has at all times attracted tourists to its verdant\r\nsnow-encircled plains, and the perfection of its climate has induced\r\nthem to linger there, and devote their leisure to the investigation of\r\nits treasures, natural and artistic. In this respect their fate is\r\nwidely different from that of temples situated on the hot and dusty\r\nplains of India, where every official is too busy to devote himself to\r\nsuch a task, and travellers too hurried to linger for a leisurely and\r\nloving survey of their beauties.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from this adventitious advantage, the temples of Kashmir\r\ndo form a group well worthy of attention. When one or two spurious\r\nexamples are got rid of, they form a complete and homogeneous group,\r\nextending through about six centuries (A.D. 600 to A.D. 1200),\r\nsingularly uniform in their development and very local, being unlike any\r\nother style known in India. They have besides this a certain classical\r\nelement, which can hardly be mistaken, and is sufficient in itself to\r\nattract the attention of Europeans who are interested in detecting their\r\nown familiar forms in this remote valley in the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the modern investigators of the subject were Messrs.\r\nMoorcroft and Trebeck, who visited the valley in 1819-25.[301] They were\r\nboth acute and intelligent observers, but, having no special knowledge\r\nof the subject, their observations on the architecture of the valley do\r\nnot add much to our knowledge of its history.\r\n\r\nThey were followed by G. T. Vigne in 1833, who being an artist drew the\r\nbuildings with wonderful correctness, so as to bring out the\r\npeculiarities of the style, and also to approximate their history with\r\nvery tolerable exactness.[302] About the same time Baron Hügel gave his\r\nimpression on the subject to the public, but in a manner much less\r\ncritical than his predecessors.[303]\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Captain (now General) A. Cunningham published in the September\r\nnumber of the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society’ an essay on what he\r\ncalled the Aryan order of architecture, but which was wholly devoted to\r\nthat of Kashmir. It was illustrated by fifteen folding plates,\r\ncontaining plans, elevations, and views, and in fact all that was\r\nrequired for settling the history of the style, and, but for one or two\r\nunfortunate mistakes, would have left little to be done by his\r\nsuccessors in this field of inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the Rev. W. C. Cowie, Chaplain on duty in Kashmir, published in\r\nthe same journal an essay on the same subject, as a supplement to\r\nGeneral Cunningham’s paper, describing several temples he had not\r\nvisited, and adding considerably to our knowledge of those he had\r\ndescribed. This paper was also extensively illustrated.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all this wealth of literature, very little remained to\r\nbe done, when in 1868 Lieutenant Cole, R.E., obtained an appointment as\r\nsuperintendent of the Archæological Survey of India, and proceeded to\r\nKashmir with a staff quite sufficient to settle all the remaining\r\noutstanding questions.[304] Unfortunately, however, Lieutenant Cole had\r\nno previous knowledge of Indian antiquities in general, and had not\r\nqualified himself by any special study for the investigation he was\r\ndeputed to undertake. All, therefore, he could do was to adopt blindly\r\nGeneral Cunningham’s dates, and in this there would have been no great\r\nharm, but, when he came across a temple which had escaped his\r\npredecessor’s attention, he arbitrarily interpolated it, with a date of\r\nhis own, into the General’s series. As all these dates are given as if\r\nperfectly ascertained without any of the reasoning on which they are\r\nbased, they would, if accepted, lead to the most erroneous conclusions.\r\nPutting these, however, aside, Lieutenant Cole’s plans and architectural\r\ndetails are a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the subject, and\r\nwith his photographs and those now available by others, enable those who\r\nhave not had an opportunity of visiting the valley to form an opinion of\r\ntheir own, and with all these lights there seems little difficulty in\r\nascertaining all the really important facts connected with this style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first and most misleading mistake that has been made with reference\r\nto Kashmiri architecture, was the assumption by General Cunningham that\r\nthe enclosure to Zein-ul-ab-ud-dín’s tomb in Srinagar originally\r\nbelonged to an ancient Kashmiri temple. Lieutenant Cole boldly prints on\r\nhis plates, “probable date A.D. 400 to 500,” a mistake as nearly as may\r\nbe of 1000 years, as it is hardly doubtful that it was erected for or by\r\nthe prince whose name it bears, and who in A.D. 1410 succeeded his\r\nfather Sikandar, who bore the ill-omened nickname of Butshikan, the\r\nidol-breaker. As will be seen from the woodcut (No. 156), it consists of\r\na series of small pointed arches in rectangular frames, such as are very\r\nfrequently found in Mahomedan art, and the peculiarities of the gateways\r\nand other parts are just such as are found in all contemporary Moslem\r\nart in India. All the mosques and tombs for instance at Ahmedabad, A.D.\r\n1396-1572, are made up of details borrowed from the architecture of the\r\nJains, and the bases of their minarets and their internal pillars can\r\nonly be distinguished from those of the heathen by their position, and\r\nby the substitution of foliage for human figures in the niches or places\r\nwhere the Hindus would have introduced images of their gods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 156. Tomb of Zein-ul-ab-ud-dín. Elevation of Arches.\r\n(From a drawing by Lieut. Cole.)]\r\n\r\nIn this instance there is no incongruity, no borrowed features; every\r\nstone was carved for the place where it is found. There are niches it is\r\ntrue on each side of the gateway, like those found at Marttand and other\r\nPagan temples; but like those at Ahmedabad they are without images, and\r\nthe arch in brick which surmounts this gateway is a radiating arch,\r\nwhich appears certainly to be integral, but, if so, could not possibly\r\nbe erected by a Hindu.[305] When General Cunningham visited the valley\r\nin 1848, he was not so familiar as he has since become with the ruins of\r\nGour, Juanpore, Ahmedabad, and other Moslem cities where the\r\narchitectural forms adopted by the Moslems are with difficulty\r\ndistinguished from those of the Hindus. With the knowledge we now\r\npossess it is not likely that any one can mistake the fact, that this\r\nenclosure was erected by the prince whose name it bears to surround his\r\ntomb, in the Mahomedan cemetery of the city in which it is found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 157. Takt-i-Suleiman. Elevation of Arches.\r\n(From a drawing by Lieut. Cole.)]\r\n\r\nAssuming this for the present, it gives us a hint as to the age of the\r\nother anomalous building in Kashmir--the temple that crowns the hill,\r\ncalled the Takt-i-Suleiman, near the capital. Inside the octagonal\r\nenclosure that surrounds the platform on which the temple stands is a\r\nrange of arches (Woodcut No. 157), similar to those of the tomb of\r\nZein-ul-ab-ud-dín (Woodcut No. 156), not so distinctly pointed, nor so\r\nSaracenic in detail, but still very nearly resembling them, only a\r\nlittle more debased in style. At the bottom of the steps is a\r\nround-headed doorway, not it is true surmounted by a true arch, but by a\r\ncurved lintel of one stone, such as are universal in the Hindu\r\nimitations of Mahomedan architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries. The\r\nsame is the case in the small temples alongside, which are evidently of\r\nthe same age.[306] The temple too, itself, is far from having an ancient\r\nlook. The one most like it, that I am acquainted with, is that erected\r\nby Cheyt Sing at Rannuggur, near Benares, at the end of the last\r\ncentury. I know of no straight-lined pyramid of a much older date than\r\nthat, and no temple with a polygonal plan, combined with a circular\r\ncell, as is the case here, that is of ancient date. The four pillars in\r\nthe cell, with the Persian inscriptions upon them, are avowedly of the\r\n17th century. It is suggested, however, that they belong to a repair; my\r\nconviction, however, is, from a review of the whole evidence, that the\r\ntemple, as it now stands, was commenced by some nameless Hindus, in\r\nhonour of Siva, during the tolerant reign of Jehangir, and that the\r\nbuilding was stopped at the date engraved on the staircase, A.H. 1069\r\n(A.D. 1659), the first year of the reign of the bigot Aurungzebe. It was\r\nthen unfinished, and has consequently remained a ruin ever since, which\r\nmay give it an ancient look, but not such as to justify any one putting\r\nit 1879 years before what seems to be its true date, as is done by\r\nGeneral Cunningham and his follower Lieutenant Cole.\r\n\r\nIf we may thus get rid of these two anomalous and exceptional examples,\r\nthe history of all the remaining temples in the valley is more than\r\nusually homogeneous and easily intelligible. The date of the principal\r\nexample--the temple at Marttand--is hardly doubtful (A.D. 750); and of\r\nthe others, some may be slightly older, but none can be carried further\r\nback than the reign of Ranaditya, A.D. 578 to 594. Nor can any one be\r\nbrought down below, say 1200, which is probably the date of that of\r\nPayech. Between these dates, with a very little local knowledge, the\r\nwhole might easily be arranged. Such a classification is, however, by no\r\nmeans necessary at present. The style during these six centuries is so\r\nuniform that it may be taken as one, for the purposes of a general\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLES.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to speak of the temples themselves, it may add to the\r\nclearness of what follows if we first explain what the peculiarities of\r\nthe styles are. This we are able to do from a small model in stone of a\r\nKashmiri temple (Woodcut No. 158), which was drawn by General\r\nCunningham; such miniature temples being common throughout India, and in\r\nall instances exact copies of their larger prototypes.\r\n\r\nThe temple in this instance is surmounted by four roofs (in the built\r\nexamples, so far as they are known, there are only two or three), which\r\nare obviously copied from the usual wooden roofs common to most\r\nbuildings in Kashmir, where the upper pyramid covers the central part of\r\nthe building, and the lower a verandah, separated from the centre either\r\nby walls or merely by a range of pillars.[307] In the wooden examples\r\nthe interval between the two roofs seems to have been left open for\r\nlight and air; in the stone buildings it is closed with ornaments.\r\nBesides this, however, all these roofs are relieved by dormer windows,\r\nof a pattern very similar to those found in mediæval buildings in\r\nEurope; and the same steep, sloping lines are used also to cover\r\ndoorways and porches, these being virtually a section of the main roof\r\nitself, and evidently a copy of the same wooden construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 158. Model of Temple in Kashmir.]\r\n\r\nThe pillars which support the porticoes and the one on which the model\r\nstands are by far the most striking peculiarity of this style, their\r\nshafts being almost identical with those of the Grecian Doric, and\r\nunlike anything of the class found in other parts of India. Generally\r\nthey are from three to four diameters in height, diminishing slightly\r\ntowards the capital, and adorned with sixteen flutes, rather shallower\r\nthan those of the Grecian order. Both the bases and capitals are, it is\r\ntrue, far more complicated than would have been tolerated in Greece, but\r\nat Pæstum and in Rome we find with the Doric order a complexity of\r\nmouldings by no means unlike that found here. These peculiarities are\r\nstill more evident in the annexed representation of a pillar found in\r\nSrinagar (Woodcut No. 159), which is a far more highly ornamented\r\nexample than the last, but equally classical in its details, and, if\r\nanything, more unlike any known examples of true Hindu architecture.\r\nNowhere in Kashmir do we find any trace of the bracket capital of the\r\nHindus, nor of the changes from square to octagon, or to the polygon of\r\nsixteen sides, and so on. Now that we are becoming familiar with the\r\nextent of classical influence that prevailed in Gandhara (_ante_, p.\r\n176) down to the 7th or 8th century, we have no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding whence these quasi-Grecian forms were derived, nor why\r\nthey should be found so prevalent in this valley. It adds, however, very\r\nconsiderably to our interest in the subject to find that the\r\ncivilization of the West left so strong an impress on the arts of this\r\npart of India that its influence can be detected in all the Kashmiri\r\nbuildings down to the time when the local style perished under Mahomedan\r\ninfluence in the beginning of the 14th century. Although, therefore,\r\nthere can be no mistake about the principal forms of the architecture of\r\nKashmir being derived from the classical styles of the West, and as\r\nlittle doubt as to the countries through which it was introduced into\r\nthe valley, it must not be overlooked that the classical influence is\r\nfainter and more remote from its source in Kashmir than in Gandhara.\r\nNothing resembling the Corinthian capitals of the Jamalgiri monastery\r\nare found in the valley. The classical features in Kashmir are in degree\r\nmore like those of the Manikyala tope and the very latest examples in\r\nthe Peshawur valley. The one style, in fact, seems to commence where the\r\nother ends, and to carry on the tradition for centuries after it had\r\nbeen lost in the country from which it was introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 159. Pillar at Srinagar. (From a drawing by W. Carpenter,\r\nEsq.)]\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, of a quasi-Doric order being currently used in the\r\nvalley from the 8th to the 12th century is one of the many arguments\r\nthat tend to confirm the theory that the Corinthian order of the\r\nGandhara monasteries is not so ancient as might at first sight appear.\r\nAt all events, if a Doric order was the style of the Kashmiri valley at\r\nso late a date, there is no _à priori_ improbability in a Corinthian\r\norder being used at Peshawur in the 5th or 6th century. On the contrary,\r\nas both were evidently derived from the same source, it seems most\r\nunlikely that there should be any break in the continuity of the\r\ntradition. Strange though it may at first sight appear, it seems as if\r\nthe impulse first given by Bactria three centuries before the Christian\r\nEra continued without a break to influence the architecture of that\r\ncorner of India for twelve centuries after that epoch.\r\n\r\nNo example of the Doric order has yet been found in Gandhara, but, as\r\nboth Ionic and Corinthian capitals have been found there, it seems more\r\nthan probable that the Doric existed there also; but as our knowledge,\r\nup to this date, is limited practically to two monasteries out,\r\nprobably, of a hundred, we ought not to be surprised at any deficiencies\r\nin our series that may from time to time become apparent.\r\n\r\nThere is still one other peculiarity of this style which it is by no\r\nmeans easy to account for. This is the trefoiled arch, which is\r\neverywhere prevalent, but which in our present state of knowledge cannot\r\nbe accounted for by any constructive necessity, nor traced to any\r\nforeign style from which it could have been copied. My own impression\r\nis, that it is derived from the façades of the chaitya halls of the\r\nBuddhists. Referring, for instance, to Woodcut No. 46 or to No. 58,[308]\r\nit will be perceived that the outline of the section of the cave at\r\nAjunta, which it represents, is just such a trefoil as is everywhere\r\nprevalent in Kashmir; and, as both there and everywhere else in India,\r\narchitectural decoration is made up of small models of large buildings\r\napplied as decorative features wherever required, it is by no means\r\nimprobable that the trefoiled façade may have been adopted in Kashmir as\r\ncurrently as the simple horse-shoe form was throughout the Buddhist\r\nbuildings of India Proper. All these features, however, mark a local\r\nstyle differing from anything else in India, pointing certainly to\r\nanother race and another religion, which we are not as yet able to trace\r\nto its source.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTTAND.\r\n\r\nBy far the finest and most typical example of the Kashmiri style is the\r\ntemple of Marttand, situated about five miles east of Islamabad, the\r\nancient capital of the valley. It is the architectural lion of Kashmir,\r\nand all tourists think it necessary to go into raptures about its beauty\r\nand magnificence, comparing it to Palmyra or Thebes, or other wonderful\r\ngroups of ruins of the old world. Great part, however, of the admiration\r\nit excites is due to its situation. It stands well on an elevated\r\nplateau, from which a most extensive view is obtained, over a great part\r\nof the valley. No tree or house interferes with its solitary grandeur,\r\nand its ruins--shaken down apparently by an earthquake--lie scattered as\r\nthey fell, and are unobscured by vegetation, nor are they vulgarised by\r\nany modern accretions. Add to this the mystery that hangs over their\r\norigin, and a Western impress on its details unusual in the East, but\r\nwhich calls back the memory of familiar forms and suggests memories that\r\nthrow a veil of poetry over its history more than sufficient to excite\r\nadmiration in the most prosaic spectators. When, however, we come to\r\nreduce its dimensions to scale (Woodcut No. 160), and to examine its\r\npretensions to rank among the great examples of architectural art, the\r\nrhapsodies of which it has been the theme seem a little out of place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 160. Temple of Marttand. (From a drawing by General A.\r\nCunningham.) Scale 100 feet to 1 inch.]\r\n\r\nThe temple itself (Woodcut No. 161) is a very small building, being only\r\n60 ft. in length by 38 ft. in width. The width of the façade, however,\r\nis eked out by two wings or adjuncts, which make it 60 ft. As General\r\nCunningham estimates that its height, when complete, was 60 ft. also, it\r\nrealises the problem the Jews so earnestly set themselves to solve--how\r\nto build a temple with the three dimensions equal, but yet should not be\r\na cube. Small, however, as the Jewish temple was, it was more than twice\r\nas large as this one. At Jerusalem the temple was 100 cubits, or 150 ft.\r\nin length, breadth, and height.[309] At Marttand these dimensions were\r\nonly 60 ft. But it is one of the points of interest in the Kashmiri\r\ntemple that it reproduces in plan, at least, the Jewish temple more\r\nnearly than any other known building.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the temple has so entirely disappeared that Baron Hügel\r\ndoubted if it ever possessed one.[310] General Cunningham, on the other\r\nhand, has no doubts on the subject, and restores it in stone on his\r\nplate No. 14. The absence, however, of any fragments on the floor of the\r\ntemple that could have belonged to the roof, militates seriously against\r\nthis view; and, looking at the tenuity of the walls and the large voids\r\nthey include, I doubt extremely if they ever could have supported a\r\nstone roof of the usual design. When, too, the plan is carefully\r\nexamined, it will be seen that none of the masses are square; and it is\r\nvery difficult to see how the roof of the porch could, if in stone, be\r\nfitted to that over the cella. Taking all these things into\r\nconsideration, my impression is, that its roof--it certainly had\r\none--was in wood; and knowing how extensively the Buddhists used wooden\r\nroofs for their chaitya halls, I see no improbability of this being the\r\ncase here at the time this temple was erected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 161. View of Temple at Marttand. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe courtyard that surrounds and encloses this temple is, in its state\r\nof ruin, a more remarkable object than the temple itself. Its internal\r\ndimensions are 220 ft. by 142 ft.,[311] which are respectable, though\r\nnot excessive; they are not much more than those of the temple of\r\nNeminatha at Girnar (Woodcut No. 126), which are 165 ft. and 105 ft.,\r\nthough that is by no means a large Jaina temple. On each face is a\r\ncentral cell, larger and higher than the colonnade in which it is placed\r\n(Woodcut No. 162), but even then only 30 ft. in height to the summit of\r\nthe roof, supposing it to be completed, and the pillars on each side of\r\nit are only 9 ft. high, which are not dimensions to go wild about,\r\nthough their strongly-impressed Grecian aspect is certainly curious and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 162. Central Cell of Court at Marttand. (From a drawing\r\nby General A. Cunningham.) No scale.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features of the courtyard, though it is\r\ncommon to all true Kashmiri temples, is thus described by General\r\nCunningham:--“I have a suspicion also that the whole of the interior of\r\nthe quadrangle was originally filled with water to a level within one\r\nfoot of the bases of the columns, and that access to the temple was\r\ngained by a raised pathway of slabs, supported on solid blocks at short\r\nintervals, which connected the gateway flight of steps with that leading\r\nto the temple. The same kind of pathway must have stretched right across\r\nthe quadrangle from one side doorway to the other. Similar pathways\r\nstill exist in the Shalimar gardens, as passages across the different\r\nreservoirs and canals. On the outside of the quadrangle, and close by\r\nthe northern side of the gateway, there is a drain by which the surplus\r\nwater found its exit, thus keeping the surface always at the same level.\r\nThe temples at Pandrethan Ledari, and in the Barahmula Pass, are still\r\nstanding in the midst of water. A constant supply of fresh water was\r\nkept up by a canal or watercourse from the River Lambadari, which was\r\nconducted alongside of the mountain for the service of the neighbouring\r\nvillage of Sinharotsika,” &c. “The only object,” the General goes on to\r\nremark, “of erecting temples in the midst of water must have been to\r\nplace them more immediately under the protection of the Nagas, or\r\nhuman-bodied and snake-tailed gods, who were zealously worshipped for\r\nages throughout Kashmir.”[312]\r\n\r\nThere are no inscriptions on this temple which would enable us to fix\r\nits date with certainty, but all authorities are agreed that the\r\nenclosure at least was erected by Lalitaditya,[313] who reigned A.D. 725\r\nto 761; and my conviction is that he also erected the temple itself.\r\nGeneral Cunningham, however, on the strength of a passage in the ‘Raja\r\nTarangini,’ ascribes the building of the temple to Ranaditya,[314] who\r\nreigned A.D. 578 to 594. He may have local information which enables him\r\nto identify the village Sinharotsika with this place which he has not\r\ngiven to the public; but even then it is only said he erected a temple\r\nto the sun at that place,[315] but nothing to show that it was this\r\ntemple. Whether also it was dedicated to the sun is not clear. I never\r\nsaw a sun temple, or a drawing of one, and can, therefore, give no\r\nopinion on that head. Be this, therefore, as it may, it seems to me\r\nextremely improbable that the temple should have stood naked for 150\r\nyears, and then that a far greater king than its founder should have\r\nadded the indispensable adjunct of a court. If, like all Kashmiri\r\ntemples, it was intended to stand in the water, something of the sort\r\nmust have existed from the beginning, and very little have been left for\r\nthe great Lalitaditya to add. In addition to this, many of the details\r\nof the temple itself are so nearly identical with those of the temple at\r\nAvantipore, erected A.D. 852 or 853, that it is very much more likely\r\nthat only 100 instead of 250 years intervened between the dates of the\r\nMarttand and Avantipore temples.\r\n\r\nThe question as to what deity this temple was dedicated to is more\r\ndifficult to determine than its date. According to the ‘Raja\r\nTarangini,’[316] especially as summarised by Wilson,[317] Lalitaditya\r\nwas at the same time Buddhist, Jaina, or Vaishnava--three religions that\r\nwere undistinguishable in that time of tolerance, but which, after 200\r\nyears of persecution and wars, came out distinct and antagonistic in the\r\n10th century. If only the plan were submitted to me, I would\r\nunhesitatingly declare it Jaina; when its water arrangements were\r\nexplained, it would as clearly appear Naga[318] (Woodcut No. 163), but\r\nnot at all necessarily antagonistic to either Buddhism or Vishnuism at\r\nthat age. As I have just said, I know nothing of sun temples, and\r\ncannot, therefore, say whether this resembles them or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 163. Niche with Naga Figure at Marttand.\r\n\r\n(From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the stone of which the temple is built is of so friable a\r\nnature that the sculptures are now barely recognisable, but, so far as\r\ncan be made out from such photographs as exist, all the principal\r\nfigures in the niches have snake-hoods--are Nagas, in fact, with three\r\nor five-headed snakes at the backs of their heads. Any one on the spot,\r\nwith his attention turned to this, could easily determine in a few\r\nminutes how far this was the case or not; but no one has yet visited it\r\nwith the preparation necessary to settle this and many other uncertain\r\npoints regarding the architecture and mythology of the place. A\r\nmonograph, however, of this temple would be a work well worthy of any\r\npains that might be bestowed upon it by any Indian archæologist; for,\r\nbesides its historical and mythological importance, many of its details\r\nare of great beauty, and they have never been drawn with the care they\r\nso well merit. (Woodcut No. 164.) As the typical example of a\r\nquasi-classical style, a perfect knowledge of its peculiarities would be\r\na landmark in the history of the style both before and after its date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 164. Soffit of Arch at Marttand. (From a Sketch by the\r\nlate Mr. Wilson, B.C.S.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAVANTIPORE.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to Marttand, among Kashmiri temples, are those of\r\nAvantipore, all erected certainly within the limits of the reign of\r\nAvantiverma, the first king of the Utpala dynasty, and who reigned from\r\nA.D. 875 to A.D. 904. The stone with which they are erected is so\r\nfriable, and the temples themselves are so ruined, that there might be a\r\ndifficulty in ascertaining to what religion they were dedicated if the\r\n‘Raja Tarangini’ were not so distinct in describing this monarch as a\r\ndevoted follower of Siva,[319] and naming these temples as dedicated to\r\nvarious forms of that god.\r\n\r\nThe two principal ruins stand in courtyards of nearly the same size,\r\nabout 200 ft. by 100 ft. or 170 ft. internally. One, called Avantiswami,\r\nhas pillars all round, like Marttand, and almost identical in design and\r\ndimensions. The other is astylar, but the temple itself was much more\r\nimportant than in the first example.[320]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic that seems most clearly to distinguish the style of\r\nthe temples at Marttand from that of those at Avantipore is the greater\r\nrichness of detail which the latter exhibit; just such a tendency, in\r\nfact, towards the more elaborate carvings of the Hindu style as one\r\nmight expect from their difference in date. Several of these have been\r\ngiven by the three authors to whose works I have so often had occasion\r\nto allude, and to which the reader is referred; but the annexed fragment\r\n(Woodcut No. 165) of one of its columns is as elegant in itself, and\r\nalmost as interesting historically, as the Doric of the examples quoted\r\nabove, inasmuch as if it is compared with the pillars of the tomb of\r\nMycene (Woodcut No. 117, vol. i.) it seems difficult to escape the\r\nconviction that the two forms were derived from some common source. At\r\nall events, there is nothing between the Peloponnesus and Kashmir, so\r\nfar as we now know, that so nearly resembles it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 165. Pillar at Avantipore. (From a drawing by Mr. Wilson,\r\nC.S.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBHANIYAR.\r\n\r\nAt a place near the remote village of Bhaniyar, on the road between Uri\r\nand Naoshera, there stands one of the best-preserved temples in the\r\nvalley. Like all the older temples, it was supplied with the means of\r\nkeeping its courtyard full of water, and during the long ages of neglect\r\nthese brought down silt and mud sufficient to half bury the place. It\r\nwas recently, however, excavated by order of the Raja of Kashmir, and\r\nhence its nearly perfect state.[321] Its dimensions are less than those\r\nof the temples last described, being only 145 ft. by 120 ft., but,\r\nexcept from natural decay of the stone, it is nearly perfect, and gives\r\na very fair idea of the style of these buildings. The trefoiled arch,\r\nwith its tall pediment, the detached column and its architrave, are as\r\ndistinctly shown here as in any other existing example of a Kashmiri\r\ncolonnade, and present all those quasi-classical features which we now\r\nknow were inherited from the neighbouring province of Gandhara. The\r\ncentral temple is small, only 26 ft. square, and its roof is now covered\r\nwith wooden shingles; but whether that was the original covering is not\r\ncertain. Looking, however, at the central side-cell of the colonnade\r\n(Woodcut No. 166), it seems to me extremely doubtful whether General\r\nCunningham is justified in restoring the roof of the temple, or of the\r\ncentral cell at Marttand in stone. My impression rather is, as hinted\r\nabove, that the temple-roof was in wood; that of the side-cell in stone,\r\nbut flat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 166. View in Court of Temple at Bhaniyar. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nAt a place called Waniyat are two groups of temples, which were\r\ncarefully examined and described by the Rev. Mr. Cowie,[322] and plans\r\nand photographs are found in Lieutenant Cole’s book.[323] They differ\r\nsomewhat from those we have been describing, inasmuch as they do not\r\nseem to have been enclosed in colonnaded courts, and consist each of one\r\nlarge and several smaller temples, unsymmetrically arranged. The larger\r\nones are 30 ft. and 32 ft. square in plan over all; the smaller 10 ft.\r\nor 12 ft.\r\n\r\nThere are no inscriptions, nor any historical indications that would\r\nenable us to fix the date of the Waniyat temples with certainty, and the\r\nstone has decayed to such an extent that the details cannot be defined\r\nwith the precision necessary for comparison with other examples; but\r\nwhether this decay arises from time or from the nature of the stone\r\nthere are no means of knowing. Lieutenant Cole, basing his inferences on\r\ncertain similarities he detects between them and the temple of the\r\nTakt-i-Suleiman, which he believes was erected B.C. 220, ascribes their\r\nerection to the first century after Christ. Reasoning from the same\r\nbasis, if the temple on the Takt belongs to the 17th century, I would\r\ninfer that they were among the most modern temples in this style in the\r\nvalley. Besides this, they are purely Hindu temples, without any of\r\nthose Naga or Jaina peculiarities that distinguish the older ones, and\r\nalmost certainly, therefore, may be placed after the year A.D. 1000. How\r\nmuch more modern they may be must be left for future inquiry.\r\n\r\nAmong the remaining examples, perhaps the one that most clearly exhibits\r\nthe characteristics of the style is that at Pandrethan (Woodcut No.\r\n167). It still stands, as it has always stood, in the centre of its\r\ntank; but the overflow drains, which originally served to keep the water\r\nat the same level, having become choked by neglect, it can now only be\r\napproached by swimming or in a boat. Originally, it seems to have had a\r\nthird storey or division to its roof, but that has fallen; the lower\r\npart of the building, however, exhibits all the characteristic features\r\nof the style in as much perfection as almost any other known example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 167. Temple at Pandrethan.\r\n\r\n(From a Drawing by General Cunningham.)]\r\n\r\nOne last example must conclude our illustrations of Kashmiri\r\narchitecture. The temple at Payech, though one of the smallest, is among\r\nthe most elegant, and also one of the most modern examples of the style\r\n(Woodcut No. 168). Its dimensions are only 8 ft. square for the\r\nsuperstructure, and 21 ft. high, including the basement; but with even\r\nthese dimensions it acquires a certain dignity from being erected with\r\nonly six stones--four for the walls and two for the roof.[324] It stands\r\nby itself on a knoll, without any court, or any of the surroundings of\r\nthe older temples, and, being dedicated wholly to the gods of the Hindu\r\nPantheon, it certainly belongs to an age when their worship had\r\nsuperseded the older faiths of the valley. It would be interesting if\r\nits date could be ascertained, as it carries with it that of the caves\r\nof Bhaumajo and of several other temples. So far as can at present be\r\nmade out, it seems to belong to the 13th century of our era, but is\r\nprobably of a more modern rather than of a more ancient date.\r\n\r\nIn order to write a complete monography of the Kashmiri style, we ought\r\nto be able to trace it very much further back than anything in the\r\nprevious pages enables us to do, and by some means to connect it with\r\nthe other styles of India. In order to do this, however, we must\r\ndiscover some Buddhist remains in Kashmir. We know from history that\r\nAsoka, B.C. 250, sent missionaries to convert the inhabitants of the\r\nvalley to the Buddhist faith, and that in the 1st century Kanishka, a\r\nBuddhist king, reigned here absolutely;[325] and we know that in the 7th\r\ncentury Hiouen Thsang found Buddhism, if not the only religion, at least\r\none of the dominant faiths of the people. The details he mentions, and\r\nthe fact of his lingering here for two whole years (A.D. 633 to A.D.\r\n634) to study its forms and scriptures, proves how important this\r\nreligion then was.[326] But not one vestige of a chaitya or of a vihara\r\nhas yet come to light; and though there are mounds which may contain\r\nstupas, it is most improbable that they will contain any architectural\r\nforms that may be of any use for our purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 168. Temple at Payech. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nWhen we know more of the forms and ages of the Gandhara monasteries\r\n(_ante_, pages 169, _et seqq._), they may supply some of the missing\r\nlinks required to connect the Kashmiri style to that of the outer world;\r\nbut till the temples in Salt Range, and other little-frequented parts of\r\nthe Punjab are examined, we shall not know all that we desire.\r\nMeanwhile the annexed woodcut (No. 169), representing a temple at Mûlot,\r\nshows how nearly the Punjabi style resembled that of Kashmir. There are\r\nthe same trefoil-headed openings; the fluted pillars, with\r\nquasi-classical bases and capitals; and a general similarity of style\r\nnot to be mistaken. There is another temple very similar, but smaller,\r\nat Kathwai; both are near Pind Dadan Khan, and from what I can learn\r\nthere are others which may form a connecting link between the Gandhara\r\nmonasteries and the Kashmiri temples. It may be that Mahomedan bigotry\r\nhas defaced them all; but, looking at the immense strides that have been\r\nmade during the last few years in this direction, I feel confident that\r\nso soon as they are looked for all that is still wanting will certainly\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 169. Temple at Mûlot, in the Salt Range. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo many and so various are the points of interest connected with the\r\nstyle of the ancient buildings in Kashmir, that they deserve much fuller\r\nillustration than is compatible with the scope of the present work.\r\nThough not magnificent, they are very pleasing and appropriate examples\r\nof art, and they have this advantage over most of the Indian styles,\r\nthat Kashmir possesses, in the ‘Raja Tarangini,’ what may be said to be\r\nthe only Indian history in existence. Any one familiar with that work,\r\nand with the actual buildings, could without much difficulty fix their\r\ndates, and from the buildings illustrate the history. This has not yet\r\nbeen accomplished, but there is no doubt that it can be done.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest connected with this style is the strange but\r\nundoubted affinity which exists between it and the architectural forms\r\nof ancient Greece. This, when fully investigated, may reveal to us\r\nrelations between the two countries or their outlying dependencies which\r\nare not now suspected.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest point of interest is that arising out of the connexion\r\nwhich at one time seems to have existed between Kashmir and Cambodia,\r\nwhich will form the subject of a subsequent chapter. Between the two we\r\nshall probably be able to gather up the threads of the long-lost form of\r\nSerpent superstition, and learn to know what were the arrangements of\r\nthe temples, and what the worship addressed to that mysterious deity.\r\n\r\nI have already, in my work on Tree and Serpent worship, and in the\r\nIntroduction, entered so fully into this subject, and said all that I\r\nhave at present to say about it, that I need not do more here than\r\nrecapitulate the results, but they can hardly be too often repeated in\r\norder to render the context intelligible. So far as I can ascertain, the\r\npeople who adopted Buddhism in India were neither the Aryans nor the\r\nDravidians, but a native aboriginal race in the north, whom the Aryans\r\ncalled Dasyus. Before their conversion they worshipped trees and\r\nserpents, and after their adoption of the higher and purer form of\r\nworship they continually relapsed to their old faith and old feelings\r\nwhenever the influence of Buddhism became weak, or its discipline\r\nrelaxed. This was especially the case in Kashmir, with Taxila, and\r\nGandhara; it was the head-quarters of Naga worship in northern India;\r\nand though the inhabitants embraced Buddhism with avidity, there are\r\neverywhere signs of their backslidings. In Kashmir the oldest temples,\r\nif not exclusively Naga, certainly show an unmistakable tendency in that\r\ndirection, and continued to do so till the Hindu revival in the 11th\r\ncentury. After that they were dedicated to Siva and Vishnu, and the\r\npeople of the valley seem to have been completely converted to the Hindu\r\nreligion, when they fell under the influence of the followers of\r\nMahomet, and adopted the faith of the Arabian Prophet in or about the\r\n14th century.\r\n\r\nIt is between the fall of Buddhism and the rise of Mahomedanism that all\r\nthe temples in the true Kashmiri style must be ranged. Before that we\r\nhave nothing--after that, only the tomb of Zein-ul-ab-ud-dín and the\r\ntemple on the Takt-i-Suleiman can be classed as examples of the style,\r\nthough the latter can hardly even claim a title to that affiliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNEPAL.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nStupas or Chaityas--Wooden Temples--Thibet--Temples at Kangra.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one looking at the map, and the map only, would probably be inclined\r\nto fancy that, from their similarity of situation and surroundings, the\r\narts and archæology of Nepal must resemble those of Kashmir. It would\r\nnot, however, be easy to make a greater mistake, for there are no two\r\nprovinces of India which are more diametrically opposed to one another\r\nin these respects than these two Himalayan states. Partly this is due to\r\nlocal peculiarities. The valley of Nepal proper--in which the three\r\ncapitals, Patan, Bhatgaon, and Khatmandu, are situated--is only twelve\r\nmiles north and south, by nine in width east and west. It is true, the\r\nbulk of the population of the Gorkha state live in the valleys that\r\nsurround this central point; but they are sparse and isolated\r\ncommunities, having very little communication with each other. Kashmir,\r\non the other hand, is one of the most beautiful and fertile valleys in\r\nthe world, measuring more than one hundred miles in one direction and\r\nmore than seventy in another, without any ridges or interruptions of any\r\nsort, and capable of maintaining a large population on one vast,\r\nunbroken, fertile plain.\r\n\r\nAnother point of difference is, that Kashmir never was a thoroughfare.\r\nThe population who now possess it entered it from the south, and have\r\nretained possession of it--in all historical times, at least--in\r\nsufficient numbers to keep back any immigration from the north. In\r\nNepal, on the contrary, the bulk of the population are Thibetans, a\r\npeople from the north, left there apparently in their passage southward;\r\nand, so far as we can gather from such histories as exist, the southern\r\nraces who are found there only entered the valley in the beginning of\r\nthe 14th century, and never in such numbers as materially to modify the\r\nessentially Turanian character of the people.\r\n\r\nNepal also differs from Kashmir from the fact that the Mahomedans never\r\nhad possession of their valley, and never, consequently, influenced\r\ntheir arts or their religions. The architectural history of the two\r\nvalleys differs, consequently, in the following particulars:--In Kashmir\r\nwe have a Buddhist period, superseded in the 8th century by an original\r\nquasi-classical style, that lasted till it, in its turn, was supplanted\r\nby that of the Moslem in the 15th century. In Nepal we have no\r\nsuccession of styles--no history in fact--for we do not know when any of\r\nthe three religions was introduced; but what we find is the Vaishnava,\r\nSaiva, and Buddhist religions existing side by side at the present day,\r\nand flourishing with a rank luxuriance unknown on the plains of Bengal,\r\nwhere probably their exuberance was checked by the example of the\r\nMoslems, who, as just remarked, had no influence in the valley.\r\n\r\nOwing to all the principal monuments in Nepal being modern--all,\r\ncertainly, subsequent to the 14th century--and to the people being too\r\npoor to indulge in such magnificence as is found on the plains, the\r\nbuildings of Nepal cannot compare, as architectural objects, with those\r\nfound in other parts of India. But, on the other hand, the very fact of\r\ntheir being modern gives them an interest of their own, and though it is\r\nan exaggeration, it is a characteristic one, when it is said that in\r\nNepal there are more temples than houses, and more idols than men; it is\r\ntrue to such an extent that there is an unlimited field for inquiry, and\r\neven if not splendid, the buildings are marvellously picturesque.\r\nJudging from photographs and such materials as are available, I have no\r\nhesitation in asserting that there are some streets and palaces in\r\nKhatmandu and Bhatgaon which are more picturesque, and more striking as\r\narchitectural compositions, than are to be found in any other cities in\r\nIndia. The style may be called barbarous, and the buildings have the\r\ndefect of being principally in wood; but their height, their variety of\r\noutline, their wealth of carving and richness of colour, are such as are\r\nnot to be found in Benares or any other city of the plains.\r\n\r\nThe real point of interest in the architecture of Nepal to the true\r\nstudent of the art lies in its ethnographic meaning. When fully\r\nmastered, it presents us with a complete microcosm of India as it was in\r\nthe 7th century, when Hiouen Thsang visited it--when the Buddhist and\r\nBrahmanical religions flourished side by side; and when the distinctive\r\nfeatures of the various races were far more marked than they have since\r\nbecome under the powerful solvent of the Mahomedan domination.\r\n\r\nFrom all these causes I believe that if the materials existed, and it\r\nwere possible to write an exhaustive history of the architecture of the\r\nvalley of Nepal, it would throw more light on most of the problems that\r\nare now perplexing us than that of any other province in India. It only,\r\nhowever, can be done by some one on the spot, and perfectly familiar not\r\nonly with the Nepalese buildings but with all the phases of the\r\nquestion;[327] but even then its value would be more ethnographic than\r\næsthetic. If this were an ethnographic history of architecture, to which\r\nthe æsthetic question were subordinate, it would be indispensable that\r\nit should be attempted, however incomplete the materials might be; but\r\nthe contrary being the case, it must suffice here to point out the forms\r\nof the architecture, merely indicating the modes in which the various\r\nstyles are divided among the different races.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike that of so many other countries of India, the mythic history of\r\nNepal commences with that of the heroes of the ‘Mahabarata,’ but with\r\nsome more reasons in this case than in most others, for it seems\r\nprobable that it was through the Himalayas that the Pandus entered\r\nIndia, and certain, at all events, that the poem represents the\r\nsurvivors of the great war returning to their homes, accompanied by\r\ntheir dogs, across these mountains, through the dominion of the Gorkhas,\r\nif not actually through the valley of Nepal. The long lists of names,\r\nhowever, that connect these events with modern events, if not purely\r\nfabulous, are at least barren of all interest, and no event is recorded\r\nbetween 1300 years B.C. and A.D. 1300 that need arrest attention. What\r\nwe do gather is, that at some remote period, probably the first century\r\nof our era, Buddhism did penetrate into the valley, and, finding it\r\ninhabited by a people of Thibetan origin, it was, of course, easily\r\nadopted, and has since remained the religion of that section of the\r\npopulation.[328]\r\n\r\nThere are two accounts of the mode in which the Hindu or Rajput element\r\nwas introduced into the valley. The favourite one is, that after the\r\nsack of Chittore by Ala-u-dîn, in 1306, the conqueror sought the hand of\r\nthe proud Rajput’s daughter, and to avoid the contamination he and his\r\nfollowers fled and sought refuge in Nepal.[329] Another account\r\nrepresents the Rajas of Mithila and Semrun--descendants of the Surya\r\nVansa kings of Ayodhya--and the Rajputs of Canouge flying in like\r\nmanner, in 1326, to avoid the tyranny of the Delhi emperors; and that it\r\nwas these tribes, and not the fugitives from Chittore, who conquered and\r\ncolonised a part of the valley.[330] Both accounts are probably to some\r\nextent true, and they and their followers form the Parbuttya or Hindu\r\nelement in the population at the present day, and make up the bulk of\r\nthose who profess the Hindu religion and worship Siva and Vishnu and the\r\nother gods of the Hindu Pantheon.\r\n\r\nBefore they entered the valley, however, it seems to have been occupied\r\nby Kiratas, Bhotyas, Newars, and other tribes of impure origin,[331]\r\naccording to the Hindu idea of purity--in other words, Tartars or\r\nThibetans--and they are those who had early adopted the doctrines of\r\nBuddha and still adhere to them. The Newars seem to have been the\r\ngoverning caste till the year 1768, when a weak sovereign having called\r\nin the assistance of a neighbouring Gorkha Raja, he seized the kingdom,\r\nand his successors still rule in Nepal. They apparently were originally\r\nof the Magar tribe,[332] but having mixed with the immigrant Hindus call\r\nthemselves Rajputs, and have adopted the Hindu religion, though in a\r\nform very different from that known in the plains, and differing in a\r\nmanner we would scarcely be inclined to expect. When the religion of the\r\ndestroyer was introduced into a country that professed the mild religion\r\nof Buddha, it might naturally be supposed that its most savage features\r\nwould be toned down, so as to meet, to some extent at least, the\r\nprejudices of the followers of the religion it was superseding. So far\r\nfrom this being the case in this instance, it is said that when first\r\nintroducing the religion the Gorkhas propitiated the deity with human\r\nsacrifices, till warned in a dream to desist and substitute\r\nanimals.[333] Besides this, the images of Durga or Kali, though hideous\r\nand repulsive enough in the plains, are ten times more so in Nepal; and,\r\nin fact, throughout there is an exaggeration of all the most prominent\r\nfeatures of the religion, that would lead to the belief that it found a\r\nsingularly congenial soil in the valley and blossomed with unusual\r\nexuberance there. This, in fact, is one of the reasons that lead to the\r\nbelief that the religion of Siva is a northern Tartar superstition,\r\nwhich, when introduced into India, was softened and modified to suit the\r\nmilder genius of the people; but among the hill tribes, with northern\r\naffinities, it was practised with all the Tantric devil-worshipping\r\npeculiarities that characterise its original birthplace. So far, too, as\r\nthe architecture of the Saiva temples in Nepal is concerned, it seems to\r\nindicate that the worship came into the valley from the north, and not\r\nfrom the plains of Bengal. The architecture of the temples of Vishnu, on\r\nthe contrary, seems evidently to be an offshoot of the art of the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUPAS OR CHAITYAS.\r\n\r\nThe two oldest and most important Buddhist monuments in the valley of\r\nNepal are those of Swayambunath and Bouddhama:[334] the former,\r\nbeautifully situated on a gentle eminence about a mile from Khatmandu,\r\nthe latter at Kasachiel, at some distance off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 170. Temple of Swayambunath, Nepal. (From a Drawing in\r\nthe Hodgson Collection.)]\r\n\r\nNo very precise information is to be had about the date of either, but,\r\nin their present form at least, they are not the oldest in the valley.\r\nAccording to Brian Hodgson, there are several low, flat, tumuli-like\r\nchaityas, with very moderate tees, which are older, and may be of any\r\nage; but, as will be seen from the previous woodcut (No. 170), that at\r\nSwayambunath is of an irregular clumsy form, and chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe exaggerated form of its tee. This is, in fact, the most marked\r\ncharacteristic of the modern Thibetan dagoba, which in China is carried\r\nfrequently to such an extent that the stupa becomes evanescent, and the\r\ntee changes into a nine or thirteen storeyed tower. According to\r\nKirkpatrick (p. 151), “this temple is chiefly celebrated for its\r\nperpetual fire, the two principal wicks having preserved their flames\r\nfrom time immemorial.” The continual presence of the fire-altar, in\r\nconnexion with statues of Buddha in Gandhara, would lead us to suspect a\r\nconnexion between fire-worship and Buddhism in that province, but hardly\r\nso intimate as this would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 171. Nepalese Kosthakar. No scale.]\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Hodgson’s collection there are nearly one hundred drawings of\r\nchaityas in Nepal, all different, most of them small, and generally\r\nhighly ornamented; but none of them grand, and none exhibiting that\r\nelegance of form or beauty of detail which characterises the buildings\r\nof the plains. From a low, flat mound, one-tenth of its diameter in\r\nheight, they rise to such a tall building as this, which is a common\r\nform, bearing the name of Kosthakar (Woodcut No. 171), in which the\r\ndagoba is only the crowning ornament, and between these there is every\r\nconceivable variety of shape and detail. Among others, there is the\r\nfour-faced lingam of Siva, with a corresponding emblem with four\r\nBuddhas; and altogether such a confusion of the two\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 172. Devi Bhowani Temple, Bhatgaon. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nreligions as to confirm the idea hinted at above, that the lingam is\r\nreally a diminutive dagoba, and not the emblem it is usually supposed\r\nto represent, though, no doubt, in modern times understood to have that\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nBy far the most characteristic and beautiful temples of the Nepalese are\r\nthose possessing many storeys divided with sloping roofs. They are\r\nunlike anything found in Bengal, and all their affinities seem with\r\nthose in Burmah or China. Usually, they seem to be dedicated to the\r\nSaiva faith, but Mr. Hodgson mentions one at Patan, where “Sakya\r\noccupies the basal floor, Amitabha the second storey, a small stone\r\nchaitya the third, the Dharmadatu Mandala the fourth; the fifth, or apex\r\nof the building, externally consisting of a small churamani, or\r\njewel-headed chaitya.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most elegant of this class is the Bhowani temple at Bhatgaon,\r\nrepresented in the previous woodcut (No. 172). It is five storeys in\r\nheight, but stands particularly well on a pyramid of five steps, which\r\ngives it a greater dignity than many of its congeners. Another,\r\ndedicated to Mahadeo, is seen in the centre of the next woodcut (No.\r\n173). It is only two storeys in height, but has the same characteristic\r\nform of roof, which is nearly universal in all buildings, civil or\r\necclesiastical, which have any pretension to architectural design. The\r\ntemple on the left of the last cut is dedicated to Krishna, and will be\r\neasily recognised by any one familiar with the architecture of the\r\nplains from its sikra or spire, with the curvilinear outline, and its\r\nclustering pavilions, not arranged quite like the ordinary types, but\r\nstill so as to be unmistakably Bengali.\r\n\r\nOne other example must complete our illustration of the architecture of\r\nNepal. It is a doorway leading to the durbar at Bhatgaon, and is a\r\nsingularly characteristic specimen of the style, but partaking much more\r\nof China than of India in the style of its ornaments (Woodcut No. 174,\r\np. 307). It is indeed so like an archway in the Nankau Pass, near\r\nPekin--given further on--that I was at first inclined to ascribe them to\r\nthe same age. The Chinese example, however, is dated in 1345;[335] this\r\none, according to Mr. Hodgson, was erected as late as 1725, yet their\r\nornamentation is the same. In the centre is Garuda, with a seven-headed\r\nsnake-hood; and on either hand are Nagas, with seven-headed hoods also;\r\nand the general character of the foliaged ornaments is so similar that\r\nit is difficult to believe in so great a lapse of time between them; but\r\nI dare not question Mr. Hodgson’s evidence. Since he was in Nepal the\r\nbuilding on the left-hand side of the cut has been “improved.” His\r\ndrawings show it to have been one of the most picturesque buildings in\r\nthe valley. It certainly is not so now.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that in speaking of the architecture of Canara\r\n(_ante_, p. 272), I remarked on the similarity that existed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 173. Temple of Mahadeo and Krishna, Patan. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nbetween that of that remote province and the style that is found in this\r\nHimalayan valley; and I do not think that any one can look at the\r\nillustrations quoted above, especially Woodcuts Nos. 150 and 153, and\r\nnot perceive the similarity between them and the Nepalese examples,\r\nthough it might require a familiarity with all the photographs\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 174. Doorway of Durbar, Bhatgaon. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nto make it evident, without its being pointed out. This being the case,\r\nit is curious to find Colonel Kirkpatrick stating, more than seventy\r\nyears ago, that “it is remarkable enough that the Newar women, like\r\nthose among the Nairs, may, in fact, have as many husbands as they\r\nplease, being at liberty to divorce them continually on the slightest\r\npretence.”[336] Dr. Buchanan Hamilton also remarks that “though a small\r\nportion of the Newars have forsaken the doctrine of Buddha and adopted\r\nthe worship of Siva, it is without changing their manners, which are\r\nchiefly remarkable for their extraordinary carelessness about the\r\nconduct of their women;” and he elsewhere remarks on their\r\npromiscuousness and licentiousness.[337] In fact, there are no two\r\ntribes in India, except the Nairs and Newars, who are known to have the\r\nsame strange notions as to female chastity, and that, coupled with the\r\narchitecture and other peculiarities, seems to point to a similarity of\r\nrace which is both curious and interesting; but how and when the\r\nconnexion took place I must leave it to others to determine. I do not\r\nthink there is anything in the likeness of the names, but I do place\r\nfaith in the similarity of their architecture combined with that of\r\ntheir manners and customs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODEN TEMPLES.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalayan districts between Kashmir and Nepal, in Kulû, Kangra,\r\nand Kumaon, there are a vast number of temples, regarding which it would\r\nbe extremely interesting to have more information than we now possess.\r\nThey are all in wood, generally Deodar pine, and, like most buildings in\r\nthat material, more fantastic in shape, but at the same time more\r\npicturesque and more richly carved than buildings in more permanent and\r\nmore intractable materials. What we now know of them, however, is mainly\r\nderived from photographs, taken without any system, only as pictures,\r\nbecause the buildings were either picturesque in themselves or so\r\nsituated as to improve the landscape. No one yet has thought of\r\nmeasuring them, nor of asking to what divinities they are dedicated, and\r\nstill less of inquiring into their age or traditions; and till this is\r\ndone it is impossible to treat of them in anything like a satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nWhenever this chapter of Indian architectural history comes to be\r\nwritten, it will form a curious pendant to that of the wooden\r\narchitecture of Sweden and Norway, the similarities between the two\r\ngroups being both striking and instructive. It can hardly be expected\r\nthat any ethnographical or political connexion can be traced between\r\npeoples so remote from one another which could influence their\r\narchitectural forms; but it is curious, if this is so, to observe how\r\npeople come independently to adopt the same forms and similar modes of\r\ndecoration when using the same materials for like purposes, and under\r\nsimilar climatic influences. Although it may, consequently, be\r\nimpossible to trace any influence that the people of the Himalayas could\r\nhave exerted on the peoples of the north-west of Europe, it is by no\r\nmeans clear that in these wooden structures we may not find the germ of\r\nmuch that is now perplexing us with regard to the earlier forms of Hindu\r\nstone architecture. Like Buddhist architecture, there can hardly be a\r\ndoubt that much of it was derived from wooden originals, and it is\r\ndifficult to see any locality where wooden styles were likely to be\r\nearlier adopted and longer practised than in those valleys where the\r\nDeodar pine is abundant, and forms so excellent and so lasting a\r\nbuilding material.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 175. Monoliths at Dimapur. (From a Drawing by Major\r\nGodwin Austen.)]\r\n\r\nAn exploration of these valleys, would, no doubt, bring to light many\r\ncurious monuments, which would not only be interesting in themselves,\r\nbut might throw considerable light on many now obscure points of our\r\ninquiries. One monument, for instance, has recently been discovered by\r\nMajor Godwin Austen near the foot of the Naga hills in Assam, which is\r\nunlike any other known to exist anywhere else.[338] The temple--if\r\ntemple it may be called--consists of a long corridor, about 250 ft. in\r\nlength and 21 ft. wide, the roof of which was supported by pillars\r\nrichly carved, spaced 15 ft. to 21 ft. apart; but its most remarkable\r\nfeatures are two rows--one of sixteen, the other of seventeen\r\nmonoliths--standing in front of this. The tallest is 15 ft., the\r\nsmallest 8 ft. 5 in., the general range being from 12 to 13 ft. in\r\nheight, and 18 ft. to 20 ft. in circumference. No two are exactly alike,\r\nthough all have a general similarity of design to those represented in\r\nthe preceding woodcut (No. 175), which may be considered as typical of\r\nthe style. Another similar monolith was found a small distance off,\r\nmeasuring 16 ft. 8 in. in height, and 23 ft. in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe natives were quite unable to give any account of these curious\r\nmonuments, nor is it easy to guess why they were placed where they are.\r\nSo far as I know, no similar monument exists anywhere, for the pillars\r\nseem perfectly useless, though attached to two rows of stones that may\r\nhave borne a roof; otherwise they look like those rows of rude stone\r\nmonuments which we are familiar with in this country and in Brittany,\r\nbut which a more artistic people may have adorned with rude carvings,\r\ninstead of leaving them quite plain, as our forefathers did. As for\r\ntheir carving, the only things the least like them, so far as I know, in\r\nIndia, are the pillars in the temple at Moodbidri (Woodcut No. 152), and\r\nin other places in Canara, but there the pillars are actual supports of\r\nroofs; these are round-headed, and evidently never were intended for any\r\nutilitarian purpose.\r\n\r\nJudging from the gateway and other remains of the town of Dimapur, in\r\nwhich these pillars are found, they cannot be of any great age. The\r\ngateway is of the Gaur type, with a pointed arch, probably of the 16th\r\nor 17th century; and, if Major Austen’s observation is correct, that the\r\nsandstone of which they are composed is of a friable and perishable\r\nnature, they cannot be of any remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting if a few more similar monuments could be\r\nfound, and Assam is one of the most promising fields in India for such\r\ndiscoveries. When Hiouen Thsang visited it, in the 7th century, it was\r\nknown as the kingdom of Kamrup, one of the three principal states of\r\nNorthern India, and continued populous and important till the Pathan\r\nsovereigns of Delhi attempted its conquest in the 15th century. Owing to\r\nthe physical difficulties of the country, they never were able to\r\nsucceed in this attempt; but they blockaded the country for many years,\r\nand, cut off from the rest of the world, the savage hill tribes on\r\neither hand, aided by famine, so depopulated the country that the jungle\r\noverpowered the feeble remnant that survived, and one of the richest\r\nvalleys in the world is now one of the most sparsely inhabited. A good\r\nand liberal government might, in a few years, go far to remedy this\r\nstate of affairs, and, if so blessed, the jungle might again be cleared\r\nand rendered fit for human population. When this is done there can be no\r\ndoubt but that the remains of many ancient cities will be found. Already\r\nCaptain Dalton has given an account of the ruins of Gohati, which was\r\nalmost certainly the ancient capital of the province. “Its former\r\nimportance,” the Commissioner says, “is well attested by the immense\r\nextent of its fortifications, and the profusion of carved stones which\r\nevery excavation of the modern town brings to light. The remains of\r\nstone gateways and old stone bridges are found both within and without\r\nthe old city walls.”[339] Captain Hannay gives a view of one of these\r\nbridges. Like all the rest, it is constructed without arches, on the\r\nhorizontal principle,[340] but it may be as old as the time of the\r\nChinese Pilgrims. Besides these, other ruins have been found and\r\ndescribed, in more or less detail, in the pages of the ‘Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal.’ When more fully known they will certainly be\r\nof considerable historic and ethnographic value, though they hardly can\r\ncompare with the vast monuments of such provinces as Orissa or Gujerat,\r\nand other parts of India Proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIBET.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely interesting if, before leaving this part of the\r\nworld, it were possible to compile anything like a satisfactory account\r\nof the Buddhist style in Thibet, for it is there that Buddhism exists in\r\nits greatest purity at the present moment, and there only is it entirely\r\nand essentially a part of the system of the people. We would gladly,\r\ntherefore, compare the existing state of things in Thibet with our\r\naccounts of India in the days of the supremacy of the same religion. The\r\njealousy of the Chinese, however, who are now supreme over that nation\r\nof priests, prevents free access to the country, and those who have\r\npenetrated beyond its forbidden barriers have either done so in the\r\ndisguise of mendicants, and, consequently, dared neither to draw nor\r\nexamine minutely what they saw, or else had little taste for portraying\r\nwhat was unintelligible, and, consequently, of very little interest to\r\nthem.[341]\r\n\r\nSo far as can be made out from such narratives as we have, there does\r\nnot seem to be in Thibet a single relic-shrine remarkable either for\r\nsanctity or size, nor does relic-worship seem to be expressed either in\r\ntheir architecture or their religious forms. But as no country in the\r\nworld possesses a larger body of priests in proportion to its\r\npopulation, and as all these are vowed to celibacy and live together,\r\ntheir monasteries are more extensive than any we know of elsewhere--some\r\ncontaining 2000 or 3000 lamas, some, if we may trust M. Huc, as many as\r\n15,000.[342] The monasteries do not seem to be built with any\r\nregularity, or to be grouped into combinations of any architectural\r\npretension, but to consist of long streets of cells, mostly surrounding\r\nsmall courtyards, three or four on each side, and sometimes two or even\r\nthree storeys high; generally, perhaps always, with a small shrine or\r\naltar in the centre. The monastery of Bouddha La, outside the city of\r\nLassa, where the Delai Lama resides, seems to be of more magnificence\r\nthan all the rest--the centre being occupied by a building four storeys\r\nhigh, crowned by a dome (making the fifth) covered entirely with sheets\r\nof gold (rather, perhaps, merely gilt), and surrounded by a peristyle of\r\ncolumns, which are gilt also. Around this central palace are grouped a\r\nnumber of smaller ones, where the inferior members of this great\r\necclesiastical order reside; but of all this it is difficult to form a\r\ndistinct idea without some better drawings than the native ones, which\r\nare at present alone available.\r\n\r\nThe Delai Lama, who resides in this palace, is believed by the Thibetans\r\nto be the living incarnation of the Deity, and, in consequence, is the\r\nprincipal, if not the only, object of worship in Lassa. There are,\r\nhowever, four or five subordinate incarnations in different parts of\r\nThibet and Mongolia, who, though inferior to this one, are still objects\r\nof worship in the places where they reside, and by particular sects of\r\nBuddhists.\r\n\r\nIt is this worship of a living rather than of a dead deity that seems to\r\nbe the principal cause of the difference of the architectural forms of\r\nIndia and Thibet. In the countries we have hitherto been describing no\r\nactual incarnation of the Deity is believed to have taken place since\r\nthe death of Sakya Muni, though the spirit of God has descended on many\r\nsaints and holy men; in India, therefore, they have been content to\r\nworship images of the departed deity, or relics which recall His\r\npresence. In Thibet, where their deity is still present among them,\r\ncontinually transmigrating, but never dying, of course such a form of\r\nworship would be absurd; no relic of a still living god can exist, nor\r\nis the semblance or the memory of any past manifestation thought worth\r\npreserving. _A priori_, therefore, we should scarcely look here for the\r\nsame class of sacred edifices as we find in India or Ceylon.\r\n\r\nOwing to the jealousy with which the country is guarded against the\r\nintrusion of Europeans, we may probably have to wait some time before\r\nThibet itself, or even the valleys dependent upon it in the Himalayas,\r\nare so accessible to European travellers as to enable them to supply the\r\ndata requisite for the purpose. In the meanwhile, however, the view\r\n(Woodcut No. 176) of the doorway of the temple at Tassiding is curious\r\nas showing a perseverance in the employment of sloping jambs, which we\r\ndo not meet with in the plains. It will be recollected that this feature\r\nis nearly universal in the Behar and early western caves (Woodcuts Nos.\r\n43, 45, and 50), but there we lose it. It may have continued to be\r\ncommonly employed during the Middle Ages, though the examples have\r\nperished; but it is curious to find it cropping up here again after a\r\nlapse of 2000 years.[343]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 176. Doorway of the Temple at Tassiding. (From Dr.\r\nHooker’s ‘Himalayan Journals.’)]\r\n\r\nAnother view in the porch of the temple at Pemiongchi is also\r\ninteresting, as showing the form of roof which we are familiar with in\r\nthe rock examples, and also as illustrating the extent to which the\r\nbracket capital of India may be carried under the influence of wooden\r\narchitecture (Woodcut No. 177). It hardly seems doubtful that the idea\r\nwas originally derived from wooden construction, but was equally\r\nappropriate to masonic forms, and is used in masonry so judiciously by\r\nIndian architects that we lose sight of its origin in most instances\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nInteresting as these minor styles undoubtedly are from their variety,\r\nand valuable though they may be for the hints they afford us in\r\nunderstanding the history of the other styles, they never can be so\r\nimportant as the greater architectural groups that are found on the\r\nplains of India itself. A monograph of the styles of Kashmir or Nepal,\r\nor of the intermediate valleys, would be an invaluable addition to our\r\nknowledge; but hardly more is required in a general history than that\r\ntheir places should be indicated, and their general characteristics so\r\ndefined as to render them recognisable. Even these minor styles,\r\nhowever, will become more intelligible when studied in connexion with\r\nthe Dravidian and northern styles, which are those it is next proposed\r\nto define and describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 177. Porch of the Temple at Pemiongchi. (From Hooker.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLES AT KANGRA.\r\n\r\nThough a little out of their place in the series, there are two small\r\ntemples in one of the Himalayan valleys which it may be expedient to\r\ndescribe here before leaving this part of the subject, as their\r\npeculiarities will assist us in understanding much that has just been\r\nsaid, or that will be presently advanced. Besides this, they do not\r\nexactly fit into any other series, but they can hardly be passed over,\r\nas they possess what is so rare in Indian temples--a well-ascertained\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe temples are situated in the village of Kiragrama, not far from Kote\r\nKangra, and, as an inscription on them records, were built by two\r\nbrothers, Baijnath and Siddhnath, in the year 804 A.D.[344] Neither of\r\nthem are large. The larger has a porch 20 ft. square inside by 28 ft.\r\n(not 48 ft.) over all externally, and the whole length of the temple,\r\nfrom front to rear, is 50 ft. The smaller one is only 33 ft. over all,\r\nincluding the sanctuary. In 1786, the large temple underwent a thorough\r\nrepair at the hands of a Raja Sinsarchand, which has obliterated many of\r\nits features; but it is easy to see at a glance what was done in the\r\nbeginning of the 9th century, and what 1000 years afterwards. The small\r\ntemple, though ruinous, is more interesting, because it has escaped the\r\nhand of the spoiler. As will be seen from the woodcut (No. 178), it has\r\nall the features of a very old temple--great simplicity of outline, no\r\nrepetitions of itself, and the whole surface of the upper part covered\r\nwith that peculiar horseshoe diaper which was so fashionable in those\r\nearly days. It looks here as if it must be copied from some brick or\r\nterra-cotta construction; otherwise its repetition over a whole surface\r\nseems unaccountable. The amalaka stringcourses are subdued and in good\r\ntaste, and the crowning ornament well proportioned.[345]\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the sikra of the larger temple was similarly\r\nadorned, but all its details are so completely obliterated by the\r\ncoating of plaster it has received that it has lost its interest. The\r\npillars, however, of its porch retain their forms up to their capitals,\r\nat least. The architraves, as may be seen from the woodcut, belong to\r\nthe repair in 1786. The shafts of the pillars are plain cylinders, of\r\nvery classical proportions, and the bases also show that they are only\r\nslightly removed from classical design. The square plinth, the two\r\ntoruses, the cavetto, or hollow moulding between, are all classical, but\r\npartially hidden by Hindu ornamentation, of great elegance, but unlike\r\nanything found afterwards. The capitals are, however, the most\r\ninteresting parts, though their details are considerably obliterated by\r\nwhitewash. They belong to what may be styled the Hindu-Corinthian order,\r\nthough the principles on which\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 178. Temples at Kiragrama, near Kote Kangra. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nthey are designed is diametrically opposed to those of the classical\r\norder of the same name. The object of both--as is well-known--is to\r\nconvert a circular shaft into a square architrave-bearing capital in a\r\ngraceful and pleasing manner. We all know the manner in which the Ionic\r\nand Corinthian capitals effect this; pleasingly, it is true, but not\r\nwithout effort and some little clumsiness, which it required all the\r\nskill and taste of classical architects to conquer. To effect this\r\nobject, the Hindus placed a vase on the top of their column, the bowl of\r\nwhich was about the same diameter as that of the pillar on which it was\r\nplaced, or rather larger; but such an arrangement was weak, because the\r\nneck and base of the vase were necessarily smaller than the shaft of the\r\npillar, and both were still circular. To remedy these defects, they\r\ndesigned a very beautiful class of foliaged ornament, which appears to\r\ngrow out of the vase, on each of its four faces, and, falling downwards,\r\nstrengthens the hollows of the neck and leg of the vase, so as to give\r\nthem all the strength they require, and at the same time to convert the\r\ncircular form of the shaft into the required square for the abacus of\r\nthe capital. The Hindus, of course, never had sufficient ability or\r\nconstructive skill to enable them to produce so perfect a form as the\r\nCorinthian or Ionic capitals of the Greeks or Romans; but it is probable\r\nthat if this form were taken up at the present day, a capital as\r\nbeautiful as either of these might even now be produced. It is, indeed,\r\nalmost the only suggestion that Indian architecture seems to offer for\r\nEuropean use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 179. Pillar at Erun of the Gupta age.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 180. Capital of Half Column from a temple in Orissa.\r\n(From a Lithograph.)]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means clear when this form of capital was first introduced.\r\nIt first appears, but timidly it must be confessed, in such late\r\nBuddhist caves as were excavated after the beginning of the 5th\r\ncentury:--as, for instance, in the Yadnya Sri cave at Nassick (Woodcut\r\nNo. 81); in the courtyard of the Viswakarma, at Ellora (Woodcut No. 63);\r\nand in some of the later caves at Ajunta--the twenty-fourth for\r\ninstance. It is found at Erun (Woodcut No. 179), among some fragments\r\nthat I believe to be of the age of the Guptas, about A.D. 400, and it is\r\ncurrently employed in the middle group of Hindu caves at Ellora, such as\r\nthe Ashes of Ravana, and other caves of that age, say about A.D. 600. It\r\nafterwards became frequent, almost universal, with the Jains, down to\r\nthe time of the Mahomedan conquest. The preceding representation of one\r\n(Woodcut No. 180), from a half column of a temple in Orissa, shows it in\r\na skeleton form, and therefore more suited to explain its construction\r\nthan a fuller capital would do. On its introduction, the bell-shaped or\r\nPersepolitan capital seems to have gone out of fashion, and does not\r\nagain appear in Indian art.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression: there can be no doubt that the temple of\r\nBaijnath is dedicated to Siva, not only from the presence of the bulls\r\nin front of it, in pavilions of the same architecture as the porch, but\r\nalso because Ganesa appears among its integral sculptures; yet, strange\r\nto say, the back niche, is occupied by a statue of Mahavira, the last\r\nJaina Tirthankar, with a perfectly legible inscription, dated in A.D.\r\n1240.[346] It looks as if the age of toleration had not passed even\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nDRAVIDIAN STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe limits within which the Dravidian style of architecture prevailed in\r\nIndia are not difficult to define or understand. Practically they are\r\nthose of the Madras Presidency, or, to speak more correctly, they are\r\nidentical with the spread of the people speaking Tamil, or any of the\r\ncognate tongues. Dr. Caldwell, in his ‘Grammar,’ estimates these at\r\nforty-five or forty-six millions,[347] but he includes among them a\r\nnumber of tribes, such as the Tudas and Gonds, who, it is true, speak\r\ndialects closely allied to the Tamil tongues, but who may have learnt\r\nthem from the superior races, in the same manner that all the nations of\r\nthe south-west of Europe learnt to speak Latin from the Romans; or as\r\nthe Cornish men have adopted English, and the Irish and northern Scots\r\nare substituting that tongue for their native Gaelic dialects. Unless we\r\nknow their history, language is only a poor test of race, and in this\r\ninstance architecture does not come to our aid. It may do so hereafter,\r\nbut in so far as we at present know, these tribes are in too rude a\r\nstate to have any architecture of their own in a sufficiently advanced\r\nstate for our purposes. Putting them aside, therefore, for the present,\r\nwe still have, according to the last census, some thirty millions of\r\npeople speaking Tamil, Telugu, Canarese, and Malayalam, whom we have no\r\nreason for doubting are practically of the same race, and who, in so far\r\nas they are Hindus--not Jains, but followers of Siva and\r\nVishnu--practise one style of architecture, and that known as the\r\nDravidian. On the east coast the boundaries of the style extend as far\r\nnorth as the mouth of the Kistnah, and it penetrates sporadically and\r\nirregularly into the Nizam’s territories, but we cannot yet say to what\r\nextent, nor within what limits.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast its natural boundary northwards is the Kistnah, but it\r\ndid at one time (A.D. 700?) reach as far as Ellora, in latitude 20°; but\r\nit seems to have been a spasmodic effort, and it took no permanent root\r\nthere, while the reflex wave brought the northern styles into the Mysore\r\nor other southern countries, where their presence was as little to be\r\nexpected as that of the Dravidian so far north.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough considerable progress has lately been made in the right\r\ndirection, no satisfactory solution has yet been arrived at of the\r\nproblem of the origin of the Dravidians. The usual theory is that,\r\ncoming from the westward, they crossed the Lower Indus, passed through\r\nScinde and Gujerat, and, keeping to the right, sought the localities in\r\nwhich we now find them; or rather, that they were pushed into that\r\ncorner, first by the Aryans, who almost certainly crossed the Upper\r\nIndus, and passed through the Punjab into the valley of the Ganges, and\r\nafterwards by the Rajputs, who followed nearly in their footsteps.\r\n\r\nIn favour of this view is the fact first pointed out by Dr.\r\nCaldwell,[348] that the Brahuis in Belochistan speak a Dravidian tongue,\r\nand may consequently be considered as a fragment of the race dropped\r\nthere _in transitu_. But against this view it may be urged that between\r\nthe Brahuis and the northern Tamils we have a tract of civilized country\r\nextending over 1000 miles in which we have no evidence of the passage of\r\nthe Dravidians, and where it is nearly certain, if it were a national\r\nmigration, we should find their traces.\r\n\r\nSo far as history is concerned, in such glimmerings of tradition as we\r\npossess, they certainly do not favour this view of matters. Not only to\r\nthey fail to afford us any trace of such a migration or conquest, but at\r\nthe earliest time at which we find any mention of them the most\r\ncivilized and important of their communities occupied the extreme\r\nsouthern point of the peninsula.[349] North of them all was forest, but\r\nbetween the Christian Era and the Mahomedan invasion we find the jungle\r\ngradually disappearing, and the southern races pushing northwards, till,\r\nin the 14th century, they were checked and driven back by the Moslems.\r\nBut for their interference it looks as if, at that time, the Dravidians\r\nmight eventually have driven the Aryans through the Himalayas back to\r\ntheir original seats, as the Maharattas, who are half Dravidians, nearly\r\ndid at a subsequent period.\r\n\r\nIf any clear or direct relationship could be discovered between the\r\nTamil and the Median or Accadian languages of Turanian origin, which the\r\ndecipherment of arrow-headed inscriptions is revealing to us, it might\r\nhelp a good deal in explaining the original introduction of the\r\nDravidians into India, and the numerous Assyrianisms that exist in the\r\nmythology and architecture of southern India. Till, however, more\r\nprogress is made in that direction, it seems it would be more expedient\r\nfor the present to assume that the Tamil-speaking races are practically\r\naboriginal, and that the evidences of connexion between them and\r\nBabylonia are due to continued and close commercial intercourse between\r\nthe Persian Gulf and the Malabar coast. That such did exist from very\r\nremote ages we may feel certain, and its extent seems such as to justify\r\nand explain any similarities that are now found existing in southern\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBe all this as it may, as far back as their traditions reach, we find\r\nthe Dravida Desa, or southern part of India, divided into three kingdoms\r\nor states, the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Cheras, forming a little\r\ntriarchy of powers, neither interfered with by the other nations of the\r\nearth, nor interfering with those beyond their limits. During the\r\ngreater part of their existence all their relations of war and peace\r\nhave been among themselves, and they have grown up a separate people, as\r\nunlike the rest of the world as can well be conceived.\r\n\r\nOf the three, the most southern was called the Pandyan kingdom; it was\r\nthe earliest civilized, and seems to have attained sufficient importance\r\nabout the time of the Christian Era to have attracted the special\r\nattention of the Greek and Roman geographers. How much earlier it became\r\na state, or had a regular succession of rulers, we know not,[350] but it\r\nseems certainly to have attained to some consistency as early as five or\r\nsix centuries before the Christian Era, and maintained itself within its\r\noriginal boundaries till in the middle of the last century, when it was\r\nswallowed up in our all-devouring aggression.\r\n\r\nDuring this long period the Pandyas had several epochs of great\r\nbrilliancy and power, followed by long intervening periods of depression\r\nand obscurity. The 1st century, and afterwards the 5th or 6th, seem to\r\nhave been those in which they especially distinguished themselves. If\r\nbuildings of either of these epochs still exist, which is by no means\r\nimprobable, they are utterly unknown to us as yet, nor have we any\r\nknowledge of buildings of the intervening periods down to the reign of\r\nTirumulla Nayak, A.D. 1624. This prince adorned the capital city of\r\nMádura with many splendid edifices, some of which have been drawn by\r\nDaniell and others. What more ancient remains there may be will not be\r\nknown till the place has been carefully and scientifically explored.\r\n\r\nThe Chola kingdom extended northwards from the valley of the Cauvery and\r\nColeroon rivers, whose banks seem always to have been its principal\r\nseat, nearly to Madras, all along the eastern coast, called after them\r\nCholomandalam or Coromandel. The date of the origin of their kingdom is\r\nnot known, but their political relations with Kashmir can be traced as\r\nearly as the 6th century, and probably earlier.[351] Their epoch of\r\ngreatest glory, however, was between the 10th and 12th centuries, when\r\nthey seem to have conquered not only their neighbours the Pandyas and\r\nCheras, but even to have surpassed the bounds of the triarchy, and\r\ncarried their arms into Ceylon, and to have maintained an equal struggle\r\nwith the Chalukyas in the north. After this period they had no great\r\nrevival like that of the Pandyas under Tirumulla Nayak, but sank step by\r\nstep under the Mahomedans, Mahrattas, and English, to their present\r\nstate of utter political annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe Cheras occupied the country northward of the kingdom of Pandya, and\r\nwestward of Chola, including a considerable part of what is now known as\r\nMysore. Their rise according to their own annals took place nearly at\r\nthe time of the Christian Era, but this most probably is an\r\nexaggeration; but there are inscriptions which prove that they were\r\npowerful in the 4th and 5th centuries. From this time they seem\r\ngradually to have extended their conquest northwards. Their sixteenth\r\nking boasts of having conquered Andhra and Kalinga,[352] and their\r\ntwentieth king, Kongani Raya III., boasts of having conquered Chola,\r\nPandya, Dravida, Andhra, Kalinga, Varada, and Maharastra desas as far as\r\nthe Nerbudda river.[353] According to the dates in the Kongadesa\r\nRajakal, this must have taken place in the 7th century, but from what we\r\nknow of history, it could not have taken place till after the overthrow\r\nof the Chalukyan dynasty, and consequently hardly before 750. That a\r\nsouthern conquest did take place about that time seems almost certain\r\nfrom the eclipse of the Chalukyas between 750 and 1000,[354] and from\r\nthe excavation of the Kylas and other temples of Dravidian architecture\r\nat Ellora about that time, and there seems no race but the Cheras who\r\ncould have effected this.\r\n\r\nVira Chola (A.D. 927-977) seems first to have checked their victorious\r\ncareer, and Ari Vara Deva, another Chola king (1004), to have completed\r\ntheir destruction. He also boasts of having carried his victorious\r\nstandard to the Nerbudda, and to have been a benefactor to Chillambaram,\r\nthe then famed temple of his race.\r\n\r\nThis was the last great effort of the early triarchy; after this the\r\nrise of the Bellalas in Mysore, and the revival of the Chalukyas in\r\ncentral India, seem to have checked them to such an extent, that they\r\nnever regained a perfect independence, though at times wealthy and\r\npowerful and capable of embarking in the most splendid architectural\r\nundertakings.[355]\r\n\r\nAlthough, politically, these three states always remained distinct, and\r\ngenerally antagonistic, the people belonged to the same race. Their\r\narchitecture is different from any other found in India, but united in\r\nitself, and has gone through a process of gradual change from the\r\nearliest times at which we become acquainted with it, until we lose\r\nsight of it altogether in the last century. This change is invariably\r\nfor the worse, the earlier specimens being in all instances the most\r\nperfect, and the degree of degradation forming, as mentioned above, a\r\ntolerably exact chronometric scale, by which we may measure the age of\r\nthe buildings.\r\n\r\nBuddhism, as before hinted, does not seem to have ever gained a footing\r\nof much importance among any of the Dravidian races of India, and as\r\nearly as the 7th century the few votaries of Buddha that existed in the\r\nsouth of India were finally expelled.[356] So completely was it\r\nextirpated that I do not know of one single Buddhist monument south of\r\nthe Kistnah, except the tope at Amravati described above, and am\r\ninclined very much to doubt if any really important ones ever existed.\r\n\r\nThe Jaina religion, on the contrary, continued to nourish at Conjeveram\r\nand in the Mysore, and seems to have succeeded Buddhism in these places,\r\nand to have attracted to itself whatever tendency there may have been\r\ntowards the doctrines of Buddhism on the part of the southern people.\r\nThough influential from their intelligence, the Jains never formed more\r\nthan a small numerical fraction of the people among whom they were\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu religion, which thus became supreme, is now commonly\r\ndesignated the Brahmanical, in order to distinguish it from the earlier\r\nVedic religion, which, however, never seems to have been known in the\r\nsouth. The two sects into which it is divided consist of the worshippers\r\nof Siva and of Vishnu, and are now quite distinct and almost\r\nantagonistic; but both are now so overloaded with absurd fables and\r\nmonstrous superstitions, that it is very difficult to ascertain what\r\nthey really are or ever were. Nor are we yet in a position to speak\r\nconfidently of their origin.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries in Assyria seem, however, to point to that country as\r\nthe origin of much that we find underlying the local colouring of the\r\nVaishnava faith. Garuda, the eagle-headed Vahana, and companion of\r\nVishnu, seems identical with the figure now so familiar to us in\r\nAssyrian sculpture, probably representing Ormazd. The fish-god of the\r\nAssyrians, Dagon, prefigures the “Fish-Avatar,” or incarnation of\r\nVishnu. The man-lion is not more familiar to us in Assyria than in\r\nIndia, and tradition generally points to the West for the other figures\r\nscarcely so easily recognised--more especially Bali, whose name alone is\r\nan index to his origin; and Maha Assura, who, by a singular inversion,\r\nis a man with a bull’s head,[357] instead of a bull with a man’s head,\r\nas he is always figured in his native land. It is worthy of remark that\r\nthe ninth Avatar of Vishnu is always Buddha himself, thus pointing to a\r\nconnexion between these two extremes of Indian faith; and we are told by\r\ninscriptions of the 14th century that there was then no appreciable\r\ndifference between the Jains and Vaishnavas.[358] Indeed, as pointed out\r\nin the introduction, it seems impossible to avoid considering these\r\nthree faiths as three stages of one superstition of a native\r\nrace--Buddhism being the oldest and purest; Jainism a faith of similar\r\norigin, but overlaid with local superstitions; and Vishnuism a third\r\nform, suited to the capacity of the natives of India in modern times,\r\nand to compete with the fashionable worship of Siva.\r\n\r\nBoth these religions have borrowed an immense amount of nomenclature\r\nfrom the more abstract religions of the Aryan races, and both profess to\r\nvenerate the Vedas and other scriptures in the Sanscrit language. Indeed\r\nit is all but impossible that the intellectual superiority of that race\r\nshould not make itself felt on the inferior tribes, but it is most\r\nimportant always to bear in mind that the Sanscrit-speaking Aryan was a\r\nstranger in India. It cannot indeed be too often repeated that all that\r\nis intellectually great in that country--all, indeed, which is\r\nwritten--belongs to them; but all that is built--all, indeed, which is\r\nartistic--belongs to other races, who were either aboriginal or\r\nimmigrated into India at earlier or subsequent periods, and from other\r\nsources than those which supplied the Aryan stock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be any essential difference either in plan or\r\nform between the Saiva and Vaishnava temples in the south of India. It\r\nis only by observing the images or emblems worshipped, or by reading\r\nthe stories represented in the numerous sculptures with which a temple\r\nis adorned, that we find out the god to whom it is dedicated. Whoever he\r\nmay be, the temples consist almost invariably of the four following\r\nparts, arranged in various manners, as afterwards to be explained, but\r\ndiffering in themselves only according to the age in which they were\r\nexecuted:--\r\n\r\n1. The principal part, the actual temple itself, is called the _Vimana_.\r\nIt is always square in plan, and surmounted by a pyramidal roof of one\r\nor more storeys; it contains the cell in which the image of the god or\r\nhis emblem is placed.\r\n\r\n2. The porches or _Mantapas_, which always cover and precede the door\r\nleading to the cell.\r\n\r\n3. Gate pyramids, _Gopuras_, which are the principal features in the\r\nquadrangular enclosures which always surround the _Vimanas_.\r\n\r\n4. Pillared halls or _Choultries_, used for various purposes, and which\r\nare the invariable accompaniments of these temples.\r\n\r\nBesides these, a temple always contains tanks or wells for water--to be\r\nused either for sacred purposes or the convenience of the priests,---\r\ndwellings for all the various grades of the priesthood attached to it,\r\nand numerous other buildings designed for state or convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDRAVIDIAN ROCK-CUT TEMPLES.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nMahavellipore--Kylas, Ellora.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be possible to point out the origin of the Dravidian\r\nstyle, and trace its early history with the same precision as we can\r\nthat of Buddhist architecture, there is nothing so mysterious about it,\r\nas there is regarding the styles of northern India, nor does it burst on\r\nus full blown at once as is the case with the architecture of the\r\nChalukyas. Hitherto, the great difficulty in the case has been, that all\r\nthe temples of southern India have been found to be of so modern a date.\r\nThe great building age there was the 16th and 17th centuries of our era.\r\nSome structural buildings, it is true, could be traced back to the 12th\r\nor 13th with certainty, but beyond that all was to a great extent\r\nconjecture; and if it were not for rock-cut examples, we could hardly go\r\nback much further with anything like certainty. Recent investigations,\r\nhowever, combined with improved knowledge and greater familiarity with\r\nthe subject, have now altered this state of affairs to a great extent.\r\nIt seems hardly doubtful now that the Kylas at Ellora, and the great\r\ntemples at Purudkul (Pattadkul), are anterior to the 10th century.[359]\r\nIt may, in fact, be that they date from the 8th or 9th, and if I am not\r\nvery much mistaken the “raths,” as they are called, at Mahavellipore are\r\nas early, if not indeed earlier, than the 5th or 6th, and are in reality\r\nthe oldest examples of their class known, and the prototypes of the\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance which has prevented the age of the Mahavellipore raths\r\nbeing before detected is, that being all cut in granite and in single\r\nblocks, they show no sign of wearing or decay, which is so frequently a\r\ntest of age in structural buildings, and being all in the same material\r\nproduces a family likeness among them, which makes it at first sight\r\ndifficult to discriminate between what is old and what new. More than\r\nthis, they all possess the curious peculiarity of being unfinished,\r\nwhether standing free, as the raths, or cut in the rock, as caves, or on\r\nits face, as the great bas-relief; they are all left with one-third or\r\none-fourth merely blocked out, and in some instances with the intention\r\nmerely indicated. It looks as if the workmen had been suddenly called\r\noff while the whole was in progress, and native traditions, which always\r\nare framed to account for what is otherwise most unintelligible, have\r\nseized on this peculiarity, and make it the prominent feature in their\r\nmyths. Add to this that it is only now we are acquiring that knowledge\r\nof the subject and familiarity with its details, which will enable us to\r\ncheck the vagaries of Indian speculation. From all these causes it is\r\nnot difficult to understand how easily mistakes might be made in\r\ntreating of such mysterious objects.\r\n\r\nIf we do not know all we would wish about the antiquities of\r\nMahavellipore, it is not because attempts have not been made to supply\r\nthe information. Situated on an open sea-beach, within one night’s easy\r\ndâk from Madras, it has been more visited and oftener described than any\r\nother place in India. The first volume of the ‘Asiatic Researches’\r\n(1788) contained an exhaustive paper on them by W. Chambers. This was\r\nfollowed in the fifth (1798) by another by Mr. Goldingham. In the second\r\nvolume of the ‘Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society’ there appeared\r\nwhat was then considered a most successful attempt to decipher the\r\ninscriptions there, by Dr. Guy Babington, accompanied by views of most\r\nof the sculptures. The ‘Madras Journal,’ in 1844, contained a guide to\r\nthe place by Lieutenant Braddock, with notes by the Rev. W. Taylor and\r\nSir Walter Elliot; and almost every journal of every traveller in these\r\nparts contains some hint regarding them, or some attempt to describe and\r\nexplain their peculiarities or beauties. Most of these were collected in\r\na volume in 1869 by a Lieutenant Carr, and published at the expense of\r\nthe Madras Government, but unfortunately the editor selected had no\r\ngeneral knowledge of the subject, nor had he apparently any local\r\nfamiliarity with the place. His work in consequence adds little to our\r\nprevious stores.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, Colonel Mackenzie undertook to illustrate the\r\nplace, and employed his staff to make detailed drawings of all the\r\nsculptures and architectural details, and a volume containing\r\nthirty-seven drawings of the place is in his collection in the India\r\nOffice, and Daniell has also published some faithful representations of\r\nthe place. Quite recently it has been surveyed by the revenue surveyors,\r\nand photographed by Dr. Hunter, Captain Lyon, and others, so that the\r\nmaterials seem ample; but the fact is, they have been collected at such\r\ndistant times, and by individuals differing so essentially in capability\r\nor instruction, that it is almost impossible, except on the spot, to\r\nco-ordinate the whole. Any accomplished architect or archæologist could\r\ndo it easily in a month, and tell us the whole story. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, the main features seem tolerably distinct, and ascertained\r\nwithin limits sufficient for our present purposes.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and most interesting group of monuments at Mahavellipore, are\r\nthe so-called five raths or monolithic temples standing on the\r\nsea-shore--one of these, that with the apsidal termination in the centre\r\nof the annexed woodcut (No. 181), stands a little detached from the\r\nrest. The other four stand in a line north and south, and look as if\r\nthey had been carved out of a single stone or rock, which originally, if\r\nthat were so, must have been between 85 ft. and 40 ft. high at its\r\nsouthern end, sinking to half that height at its northern extremity, and\r\nits width diminishing in a like proportion.\r\n\r\nThe first on the north is a mere Pansala or cell 11 ft. square\r\nexternally, and 16 ft. high. It is the only one too that seems finished\r\nor nearly so, but it has no throne or image internally from which we\r\nmight guess its destination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 181. Raths, Mahavellipore. (From a Sketch by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\nThe next is a small copy of the last to the southward, and measures 11\r\nft. by 16 ft. in plan, and 20 ft. in height. The third, seen partially\r\nin the above woodcut, is very remarkable: it is an oblong building with\r\na curvilinear shaped roof with a straight ridge. Its dimensions are 42\r\nft. long, 25 ft. wide, and 25 ft. high. Externally, it seems to have\r\nbeen completely carved, but internally only partially excavated, the\r\nworks being apparently stopped by an accident. It is cracked completely\r\nthrough, so that daylight can be seen through it, and several masses of\r\nthe rock have fallen to the ground--this has been ascribed to an\r\nearthquake and other causes. My impression is, the explanation is not\r\nfar to seek, but arose from unskilfulness on the part of workmen\r\nemployed in a first attempt. Having completed the exterior, they set to\r\nwork to excavate the interior so as to make it resemble a structural\r\nbuilding of the same class, leaving only such pillars and supports as\r\nwere sufficient to support a wooden roof of the ordinary construction.\r\nIn this instance it was a mass of solid granite which, had the\r\nexcavation been completed, would certainly have crushed the lower storey\r\nto powder. As it was, the builders seem to have taken the hint of the\r\ncrack and stopped the further progress of the works.\r\n\r\nThe last, however, is the most interesting of the series. A view of it\r\nhas already been given (Woodcut No. 66), and it is shown on the right\r\nhand of the last woodcut. Its dimensions are 27 ft. by 28 ft. in plan,\r\n34 ft. in height. Its upper part is entirely finished with its\r\nsculptures, the lower merely blocked out. It may be, that frightened by\r\nthe crack in the last-named rath, or from some other cause, they\r\ndesisted, and it still remains in an unfinished state.\r\n\r\nThe materials for fixing the age of this rath are, first, the\r\npalæographical form of the characters used in the numerous inscriptions\r\nwith which it is covered.[360] Comparing these with Prinsep’s alphabets,\r\nallowing for difference of locality, they seem certainly to be anterior\r\nto the 7th century.[361] The language, too, is Sanscrit, while all the\r\nChola inscriptions of the 10th and subsequent centuries are in Tamil,\r\nand in very much more modern characters.[362] Another proof of antiquity\r\nis the character of the sculpture. We have on this rath most of the\r\nHindu Pantheon, such as Brahma and Vishnu; Siva too appears in most of\r\nhis characters, but all in forms more subdued than are to be found\r\nelsewhere. The one extravagance is that the gods generally have four\r\narms--never more--to distinguish them from mortals; but none of these\r\ncombinations or extravagances we find in the caves here, or at Ellora or\r\nElephanta. It is the soberest and most reasonable version of the Hindu\r\nPantheon yet discovered, and consequently one of the most interesting,\r\nas well, probably, as the earliest.\r\n\r\nNone of the inscriptions on the raths have dates, but from the mention\r\nof the Pallavas in connexion with this place, I see no reason for\r\ndoubting the inference drawn by Sir Walter Elliot from their\r\ninscriptions--“that the excavations could not well have been made later\r\nthan the 6th century.”[363] Add to all this, that these raths are\r\ncertainly very like Buddhist buildings, as we learn to know them from\r\nthe early caves, and it seems hardly to admit of doubt that we have\r\nhere petrifactions of the last forms of Buddhist architecture,[364] and\r\nof the first forms of that of the Dravidians.\r\n\r\nThe want of interiors in these raths makes it sometimes difficult to\r\nmake this so clear as it might be. We cannot, for instance, tell whether\r\nthe apsidal rath in the centre of woodcut No. 181 was meant to reproduce\r\na chaitya hall, or a vihara like that of woodcut No. 48. From its being\r\nin several storeys I would infer the latter, but the whole is so\r\nconventionalised by transplantation to the south, and by the different\r\nuses to which they are applied for the purposes of a different religion,\r\nthat we must not stretch analogies too far.[365]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 182. Arjuna’s Rath, Mahavellipore. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThere is one other rath, at some distance from the others, called\r\nArjuna’s rath, represented in the above woodcut (No. 182), which,\r\nstrange to say, is finished, or nearly so, and gives a fair idea of the\r\nform these oblong temples took before we have any structural buildings\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 183. Perumal Pagoda, Mádura. (From a MS. Drawing in the\r\npossession of the late General Monteith, Madras Engineers.) No scale.]\r\n\r\nof the class. This temple, though entering in the side, was never\r\nintended to be pierced through, but always to contain a cell. The large\r\noblong rath, on the contrary, was intended to be open all round, and\r\nwhether, consequently, we should consider it as a choultrie or a gopura\r\nis not quite clear. One thing, at all events, seems certain--and it is\r\nwhat interests us most here--that the square raths are copies of\r\nBuddhist viharas, and are the originals from which all the vimanas in\r\nsouthern India were copied, and continued to be copied nearly unchanged\r\nto a very late period. Woodcut No. 183, for instance, represents one\r\nfrom Mádura, erected in the 18th century. It is changed, it is true, and\r\nthe cells and some of the earlier features are hardly recognisable; but\r\nthe wonder rather is that twelve centuries should not have more\r\ncompletely obliterated all traces of the original. There is nothing,\r\nhowever, in it which cannot be easily recognised in intermediate\r\nexamples, and their gradual transformation detected by any one familiar\r\nwith the subject. On the other hand, the oblong raths were halls or\r\nporticoes with the Buddhists, and became the gopuras or gateways which\r\nare frequently--indeed generally--more important parts of Dravidian\r\ntemples than the vimanas themselves. They, too, like the vimanas, retain\r\ntheir original features very little changed to the present day, as may\r\nbe seen from the annexed example from a modern Tamil temple on the\r\nopposite shore of the Gulf of Manaar (Woodcut No. 184). To all this,\r\nhowever, we shall have frequent opportunities of referring in the\r\nsequel, and it will become much plainer as we proceed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 184. Entrance to a Hindu Temple, Colombo. (From Sir J. E.\r\nTennent’s ‘Ceylon.’)]\r\n\r\nThe other antiquities at Mahavellipore, though very interesting in\r\nthemselves, are not nearly so important for our history as the raths\r\njust described. The caves are generally small, and fail architecturally,\r\nfrom the feebleness and tenuity of their supports. The southern cave\r\ndiggers had evidently not been grounded in the art, like their northern\r\ncompeers, by the Buddhists. The long experience of the latter in the art\r\ntaught them that ponderous masses were not only necessary to support\r\ntheir roofs, but for architectural effect; and neither they nor the\r\nHindus who succeeded them in the north ever hesitated to use pillars of\r\ntwo or three diameters in height, or to crowd them together to any\r\nrequired extent. In the south, on the contrary, the cave diggers tried\r\nto copy literally the structural pillars used to support wooden roofs.\r\nHence, I believe, the accident to the long rath, and hence certainly the\r\npoor and modern look of all the southern caves, which has hitherto\r\nproved such a stumbling-block to all who have tried to guess their age.\r\nTheir sculpture is better, and some of their best designs rank with\r\nthose of Ellora and Elephanta, with which they were, in all\r\nprobability, contemporary. Now, however, that we know that the\r\nsculptures in cave No. 3 at Badami were executed in the 6th century[366]\r\n(A.D. 579), we are enabled to approximate the date of those in the\r\nMahavellipore caves with very tolerable certainty. The Badami sculptures\r\nare so similar in style with the best examples there that they cannot be\r\nfar distant in date, and if placed in the following century it will not\r\nprobably be far from the truth.\r\n\r\nThe great bas-relief on the rock, 90 ft. by 40 ft., is perhaps the most\r\nremarkable thing of its class in India. Now that it is known to be\r\nwholly devoted to Serpent worship,[367] it acquires an interest it had\r\nnot before, and opens a new chapter in Indian mythology.[368] There\r\nseems nothing to enable us to fix its age with absolute certainty; it\r\ncan hardly, however, be doubted that it is anterior to the 10th century,\r\nand may be a couple of centuries earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 185. Tiger Cave at Saluvan Kuppan. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThere is one other antiquity in a place called Saluvan Kuppan, two miles\r\nnorth of Mahavellipore, which has not yet been drawn or described, but\r\ndeserves notice as a lineal descendant of the tiger cave at Cuttack\r\n(Woodcut No. 73). Here not one but a dozen of tiger heads welcome the\r\nanchorite to his abode. Here, too, they are conventionalised as we\r\nalways find them in Chalukyan art; and this example serves, like every\r\nother, to show how the Hindu imagination in art runs wild when once\r\nfreed from the trammels of sober imitation of natural things, which we\r\nfind to be its characteristic in the early stages of Buddhist art.\r\n\r\n\r\nKYLAS, ELLORA.\r\n\r\nFrom the raths at Mahavellipore to the Kylas at Ellora the transition is\r\neasy, but the step considerable. At the first-named place we have\r\nmanifest copies of structures intended originally for other purposes,\r\nand used at Mahavellipore in a fragmentary and disjointed manner. At\r\nEllora, on the contrary, the whole is welded together, and we have a\r\nperfect Dravidian temple, as complete in all its parts as at any future\r\nperiod, and so far advanced that we might have some difficulty in\r\ntracing the parts back to their originals without the fortunate\r\npossession of the examples on the Madras shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 186. Kylas at Ellora. (Corrected from a Plan in Daniell’s\r\n‘Views in Hindostan.’) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nIndependently, however, of its historical or ethnographical value, the\r\nKylas is in itself one of the most singular and interesting monuments of\r\narchitectural art in India. Its beauty and singularity always excited\r\nthe astonishment of travellers, and in consequence it is better known\r\nthan almost any other structure in that country, from the numerous views\r\nand sketches of it that have been published. Unlike the Buddhist\r\nexcavations we have hitherto been describing, it is not a mere interior\r\nchamber cut in the rock, but is a model of a complete temple, such as\r\nmight have been erected on the plain. In other words, the rock has been\r\ncut away, externally as well as internally. The older caves are of a\r\nmuch more natural and rational design than this temple, because, in\r\ncutting away the rock around it to provide an exterior, the whole has\r\nnecessarily been\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 187. Kylas, Ellora. (From a Sketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nplaced in a pit. In the cognate temples at Mahavellipore (Woodcut No.\r\n181) this difficulty has been escaped by the fact that the boulders of\r\ngranite out of which they are hewn were found lying free on the shore;\r\nbut at Ellora, no insulated rock being available, a pit was dug around\r\nthe temple in the sloping side of the hill, about 100 ft. deep at its\r\ninmost side, and half that height at the entrance or gopura, the floor\r\nof the pit being 150 ft. wide and 270 ft. in length. In the centre of\r\nthis rectangular court stands the temple, as shown in the preceding plan\r\n(Woodcut No. 186), consisting of a vimana, between 80 ft. and 90 ft. in\r\nheight, preceded by a large square porch, supported by sixteen columns\r\n(owing probably to the immense weight to be borne); before this stands a\r\ndetached porch, reached by a bridge; and in front of all stands the\r\ngateway, which is in like manner connected with the last porch by a\r\nbridge, the whole being cut out of the native rock. Besides these there\r\nare two pillars or deepdans (literally lamp-posts) left standing on each\r\nside of the detached porch, and two elephants about the size of life.\r\nAll round the court there is a peristylar cloister with cells, and some\r\nhalls not shown in the plan, which give to the whole a complexity, and\r\nat the same time a completeness, which never fail to strike the\r\nbeholder with astonishment and awe.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the view (Woodcut No. 187) the outline of the\r\nvimana is at first sight very similar to that of the raths at\r\nMahavellipore, but on closer inspection we find everything so modified\r\nat Ellora as to make up a perfect and well understood design. The vimana\r\nwith its cells, and the porch in front of it with its side cells, make a\r\ncomplete Hindu temple such as are found in hundreds in southern India,\r\nand instead of the simulated cells that surround the hall in the Madras\r\nexample, they again become realities, but used for widely different\r\npurposes. Instead of being the simulated residences of priests, the five\r\nor rather seven cells that surround the central object here are each\r\ndevoted to a separate divinity of the Hindu Pantheon, and group most\r\npleasingly with the central vimana. It is, however, so far as is now\r\nknown, the last reminiscence of this Buddhist arrangement in Hindu\r\narchitecture; after the year 1000 even these cells disappear or become\r\nindependent erections, wholly separated from the temple itself.\r\n\r\nThough considerably damaged by Moslem violence, the lower part of the\r\ngopura shows a considerable advance on anything found at Mahavellipore,\r\nand a close approach to what these objects afterwards became, in so far,\r\nat least, as the perpendicular parts are concerned; instead, however, of\r\nthe tall pyramids which were so universal afterwards, the gopura in the\r\nKylas exhibits only what may be called the germ of such an arrangement.\r\nIt is only the upper member of a gopura placed in the flat roof of the\r\ngateway, and so small as not to be visible except from above. In more\r\nmodern times from five to ten storeys would have been interposed to\r\nconnect these two parts. Nothing of the kind however exists here.[369]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the porch are the two square pillars called deepdans,\r\nor lamp-posts, before alluded to, the ornament at the top of which\r\npossibly represents a flame, though it is difficult to ascertain what it\r\nreally is, while the temptation to consider them as representatives of\r\nthe lion pillars of the Buddhists (Woodcut No. 6) is very great (Woodcut\r\nNo. 188).\r\n\r\nIn the south of India, however, among the Jains, as mentioned above (p.\r\n276), such pillars are very common, standing either singly or in pairs\r\nin front of the gopuras, and always apparently intended to carry lamps\r\nfor festivals. They generally consist of a single block of granite,\r\nsquare at base, changing to an octagon, and again to a figure of sixteen\r\nsides, with a capital of very elegant shape. Some, however, are\r\ncircular, and, indeed, their variety is infinite. They range from 30\r\nft. to 40 ft. and even 50 ft. in height, and, whatever their dimensions,\r\nare among the most elegant specimens of art in southern India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 183. Deepdan in Dharwar. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no inscription or other date from which the age\r\nof the Kylas can be ascertained with precision. It is safe, however, to\r\nassert that it was erected by the southern Dravidians, either the Cheras\r\nor the Cholas who held sway here during the eclipse of the Chalukyas, or\r\nbetween A.D. 750 and 950; and Mr. Burgess’s recent researches in Dharwar\r\nenable us to assert with tolerable confidence that its age must be\r\nnearer the first than the second of these dates. The great temple at\r\nPurudkul--his Pattadkal--is covered with inscriptions, none of which\r\nunfortunately are dated, but from their import and the form of their\r\ncharacters, both Bhau Daji[370] and himself ascribe to the 8th or 9th\r\ncentury,[371] and I see no reason for doubting the correctness of the\r\ndate assigned by Mr. Burgess to this temple, which, according to him was\r\nerected during the 8th century. In plan it is almost exactly a duplicate\r\nof the Kylas, as may be gathered from the annexed woodcut (No. 189), but\r\nthere is some little difficulty in instituting such a comparison of\r\ntheir architecture as would enable us to feel sure of their relative\r\ndates[372]--in the first place, because the one is structural the other\r\nrock-cut, but also because we hardly know what allowance to make for\r\ndistance of locality. On the whole, however, I am inclined to believe\r\nthe southern temple is the elder of the two, but certainly not distant\r\nin date. If, consequently, it were necessary to fix on a date which\r\nshould correctly represent our present knowledge of the age of the\r\nKylas, I would put down A.D. 800, with considerable confidence that it\r\nwas not many years from the truth either way, allowing, of course, some\r\nthirty to fifty years for the execution of so important a monument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 189. Plan of Great Temple at Purudkul. (From a Plan by Mr\r\nBurgess.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nConsiderable misconception exists on the subject of cutting temples in\r\nthe rock. Almost every one who sees these temples is struck with the\r\napparently prodigious amount of labour bestowed on their excavation, and\r\nthere is no doubt that their monolithic character is the principal\r\nsource of the awe and wonder with which they have been regarded, and\r\nthat, had the Kylas been an edifice of masonry situated on the plain, it\r\nwould scarcely have attracted the attention of European travellers. In\r\nreality, however, it is considerably easier and less expensive to\r\nexcavate a temple than to build one. Take, for instance, the Kylas, the\r\nmost wonderful of all this class. To excavate the area on which it\r\nstands would require the removal of about 100,000 cubic yards of rock,\r\nbut, as the base of the temple is solid and the superstructure massive,\r\nit occupies in round numbers about one-half of the excavated area, so\r\nthat the question is simply this--whether it is easier to chip away\r\n50,000 yards of rock, and shoot it to spoil (to borrow a railway term)\r\ndown a hillside, or to quarry 50,000 cubic yards of stone, remove it,\r\nprobably a mile at least to the place where the temple is to be built,\r\nand then to raise and set it. The excavating process would probably cost\r\nabout one-tenth of the other. The sculpture and ornament would be the\r\nsame in both instances, more especially in India, where buildings are\r\nalways set up in block, and the carving executed _in situ_. Nevertheless\r\nthe impression produced on all spectators by these monolithic masses,\r\ntheir unalterable character, and appearance of eternal durability, point\r\nto the process as one meriting more attention than it has hitherto\r\nreceived in modern times; and if any rock were found as uniform and as\r\neasily worked as the Indian amygdaloidal traps, we might hand down to\r\nposterity some more durable monument than many we are now erecting at\r\nfar greater cost.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this branch of the subject there is one other rock-cut\r\nexample which deserves to be quoted, not either for its size or\r\nantiquity, but from the elegance of its details. It is situated at a\r\nplace called Kûmûlûlû,[373] thirty-five miles south-west from\r\nShivelliputtun, and consequently twice that distance north from Cape\r\nComorin. Like the examples at Mahavellipore, this one never was\r\nfinished, probably because the person who commenced it did not live to\r\ncomplete it, and it was nobody’s business to finish what was of no use,\r\nand intended only to glorify him who made it. It is not cut out of a\r\nseparate boulder, but out of a ridge, as I fancy those at Mahavellipore\r\nto have been, and if successful, any number of others of any dimensions\r\nmight have followed. The other side of the hill had been occupied by the\r\nJains, and numerous images of their Tirthankars are carved upon it, with\r\ninscriptions that could easily be read if any one cared to do so. It was\r\nevidently to mark the triumph of Siva over Mahavira that this little\r\nshrine was undertaken, probably in the 10th or 11th century, and if it\r\nhad been completed it would have been one of the most perfect gems of\r\nthe style. For some reason unexplained it was only blocked out, and the\r\nupper part only carved, when it was abandoned, and is now entirely\r\nforsaken. From its details, it certainly is more modern than the\r\nKylas--how much we cannot yet say with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDRAVIDIAN TEMPLES.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nTanjore--Tiruvalur--Seringham--Chillambaram--Ramisseram--\r\nMádura--Tinnevelly--Combaconum--Conjeveram--Vellore\r\nand Peroor--Vijayanagar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from these few scattered rock-cut examples to the great\r\nstructural temples of the style, we find their number is so great, their\r\nextent so vast, and their variety so perplexing, that it is extremely\r\ndifficult to formulate any distinct ideas regarding them, and still more\r\nso, as a matter of course, to convey to others any clear idea on the\r\nsubject. To any one at all familiar with the present status of the\r\npopulation of the province, the greatest wonder is how such a people\r\ncould ever have conceived, much less carried out, such vast undertakings\r\nas these, and that so recently that some of the greatest and boldest\r\nwere only interrupted by our wars with the French little more than a\r\ncentury ago. The cause of this, however, is not far to seek. Ever since\r\nwe took possession of the country, our countrymen have been actuated by\r\nthe most beneficent intentions of protecting the poor against the\r\noppression of the rich. By every means we have sought to secure the ryot\r\nin his holding, and that he should not be called on to pay more than his\r\nfair share of the produce of his land; while to the landowner we have\r\noffered a secure title to what belonged to him, and a fixed income in\r\nmoney in lieu of his portion of the produce. To a people, however, in\r\nthe state of civilization to which India has reached, a secure title and\r\na fixed income only means the power of borrowing on the occasion of a\r\nmarriage, a funeral, or some great family festival, ten times more than\r\nthe borrower can ever pay, and our courts as inevitably give the lender\r\nthe power of foreclosing his mortgage and selling the property. During\r\nthe century in which this communistic process has been going on the\r\nlanded aristocracy have gradually disappeared. All the wealth of the\r\ncountry has passed into the hands of the money-lenders of the cities,\r\nand by them dissipated in frivolities. If the aim of the government is\r\nto reduce the whole population to the condition of peasant proprietors,\r\noccupying the land without capital, and consequently on the verge of\r\nstarvation, they have certainly succeeded. It may be beneficent, and\r\nmay produce the greatest happiness to the greatest number; but in such a\r\ncommunity neither science, nor literature, nor art have any place, and\r\nreligion itself becomes degraded by the status of its votaries.\r\n\r\nBefore we interfered, the condition of things was totally different. The\r\npractical proprietorship of the land was then in the hands of a few\r\nprinces or feudal lords, who derived from it immense revenues they had\r\nno means of spending, except in works of ostentation, which in certain\r\nstages of civilization are as necessary for the employment of the masses\r\nas for their own glorification. In such a country as India the\r\nemployment of one-half of the population in agriculture is sufficient to\r\nproduce food for the whole, while the other half are free for any\r\nemployment that may be available. We in this country employ our\r\nnon-agricultural half in manufactures and commerce. The southern Indians\r\nhad neither, and found no better occupation for the surplus population\r\nthan in temple-building. Whether this was more profitable or beneficial\r\nthan hammering iron or spinning cotton is not a question it is necessary\r\nto enter on here. It is enough to know the fact, and to mark its\r\nconsequences. The population of southern India in the 17th and 18th\r\ncentury was probably hardly less than it is now--some thirty\r\nmillions--and if one-third or one-fourth of such a population were to\r\nseek employment in building, the results, if persevered in through\r\ncenturies, would be something astonishing. A similar state of affairs\r\nprevailed apparently in Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs, but with very\r\ndifferent results. The Egyptians had great and lofty ideas, and a\r\nhankering after immortality, that impressed itself on all their works.\r\nThe southern Indians had no such aspirations. Their intellectual status\r\nis, and always was, mediocre; they had no literature of their own--no\r\nhistory to which they could look back with pride, and their religion\r\nwas, and is, an impure and degrading fetishism. It is impossible that\r\nanything very grand or imposing should come out of such a state of\r\nthings. What they had to offer to their gods was a tribute of labour,\r\nand that was bestowed without stint. To cut a chain of fifty links out\r\nof a block of granite and suspend it between two pillars, was with them\r\na triumph of art. To hollow deep cornices out of the hardest basalt, and\r\nto leave all the framings, as if of the most delicate woodwork, standing\r\nfree, was with them a worthy object of ambition, and their sculptures\r\nare still inexplicable mysteries, from our ignorance of how it was\r\npossible to execute them. All that millions of hands working through\r\ncenturies could do, has been done, but with hardly any higher motive\r\nthan to employ labour and to conquer difficulties, so as to astonish by\r\nthe amount of the first and the cleverness with which the second was\r\novercome--and astonished we are; but without some higher motive true\r\narchitecture cannot exist. The Dravidians had not even the constructive\r\ndifficulties to overcome which enabled the mediæval architects to\r\nproduce such noble fabrics as our cathedrals. The aim of architects in\r\nthe Middle Ages was to design halls which should at the same time be\r\nvast, but stable, and suited for the accommodation of great multitudes\r\nto witness a lofty ritual. In their struggle to accomplish this they\r\ndeveloped intellectual powers which impress us still through their\r\nworks. No such lofty aims exercised the intellectual faculties of the\r\nHindu. His altar and the statue of his god were placed in a dark cubical\r\ncell wholly without ornament, and the porch that preceded that was not\r\nnecessarily either lofty or spacious. What the Hindu architect craved\r\nfor, was a place to display his powers of ornamentation, and he thought\r\nhe had accomplished all his art demanded when he covered every part of\r\nhis building with the most elaborate and most difficult designs he could\r\ninvent. Much of this ornamentation, it is true, is very elegant, and\r\nevidences of power and labour do impress the human imagination, often\r\neven in defiance of our better judgment, and nowhere is this more\r\napparent than in these Dravidian temples. It is in vain, however, we\r\nlook among them for any manifestation of those lofty aims and noble\r\nresults which constitute the merit and the greatness of true\r\narchitectural art, and which generally characterise the best works in\r\nthe true styles of the western world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning from these generalities to the temples themselves, the first\r\ngreat difficulty experienced in attempting either to classify or\r\ndescribe them is that no plans of them exist. I know myself upwards of\r\nthirty great Dravidian temples, or groups of temples, any one of which\r\nmust have cost as much to build as an English cathedral, some a great\r\ndeal more; but of all these there are only three, or it may be four, of\r\nwhich even a moderately trustworthy plan is available. Two-thirds of\r\nthese have been sufficiently photographed by Dr. Hunter, Capt.\r\nLyon,[374] and others; the remaining third I know either from personal\r\ninspection or from drawings and descriptions. This is, of course,\r\nirrespective of village temples, and, it may be, of some extensive\r\ngroups which have been overlooked. If these temples had been built like\r\nthose of the Greeks, or even as the Christian churches in the Middle\r\nAges, on one uniform plan, changing only with the progress of time, one\r\nor two plans might have sufficed; but the fact is that, in nine cases\r\nout of ten, Dravidian temples are a fortuitous aggregation of parts,\r\narranged without plan, as accident dictated at the time of their\r\nerection; and, without plans, no adequate idea can be conveyed to those\r\nwho have not seen them. The one great exception to this rule is to be\r\nfound at Tanjore. The great Pagoda there was commenced on a well-defined\r\nand stately plan, which was persevered in till its completion. As will\r\nbe seen from the annexed diagram (Woodcut No. 190) it consists of two\r\ncourts,[375] one a square of about 250 ft., originally devoted to minor\r\nshrines and residences; but when the temple was fortified by the French\r\nin 1777[376] it was converted into an arsenal, and has not been\r\nre-appropriated to sacred purposes. The temple itself stands in a\r\ncourtyard extremely well proportioned to receive it, being about 500 ft.\r\nlong by half that in width, the distance between the gateway and the\r\ntemple being broken by the shrine of the Bull Nundi,[377] which is\r\nsufficiently important for its purpose, but not so much so as to\r\ninterfere with the effect of the great vimana, which stands near the\r\ninner end of the court. The perpendicular part of its base measures 82\r\nft. square, and is two storeys in height, of simple outline, but\r\nsufficiently relieved by niches and pilasters. Above this the pyramid\r\nrises in thirteen storeys to the summit, which is crowned by a dome said\r\nto consist of a single stone, and reaching a height of 190 ft. The porch\r\nin front is kept low, and as will be seen from the woodcut (No. 191) the\r\ntower dominates over the gopuras and surrounding objects in a manner\r\nthat imparts great dignity to the whole composition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 190. Diagram Plan of Tanjore Pagoda. (From a Sketch by\r\nthe Author.) Scale 200 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nBesides the great temple and the Nundi porch there are several other\r\nsmaller shrines in the enclosure, one of which, dedicated to\r\nSoubramanya, a son of Siva’s, is as exquisite a piece of decorative\r\narchitecture as is to be found in the south of India, and though small,\r\nalmost divides our admiration with the temple itself (Woodcut No. 192).\r\nIt is built behind an older shrine, which may be coeval with the great\r\ntemple as originally designed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 191. View of the Great Pagoda at Tanjore. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Middleton Rayne, Esq., C.E.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the Tanjore temple is that all the\r\nsculptures on the gopuras belong to the religion of Vishnu, while\r\neverything in the courtyard is dedicated to the worship of Siva. At\r\nfirst I felt inclined to believe it had been erected wholly in honour of\r\nthe first-named divinity, but am now more inclined to the belief that it\r\nis only an instance of the extreme tolerance that prevailed at the age\r\nat which it was erected, before these religions became antagonistic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 192. Temple of Soubramanya, Tanjore. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was that age? Strange to say, though so complete and\r\nuniform, and standing, as it does, almost alone, its date is not known.\r\nMr. Norman, a competent authority, in the text that accompanied Tripe’s\r\nphotographs, says it was erected by Kadu Vettiya Soran, or Cholan,[378]\r\na king reigning at Conjeveram in the beginning of the 14th century. At\r\none time I hoped it was earlier, but on the whole I am now convinced\r\nthat this must be very nearly the truth.\r\n\r\nThe Soubramanya is certainly one century, probably two centuries, more\r\nmodern. The Bull itself is also inferior in design, and therefore more\r\nmodern than those at Hullabîd, which belong probably to the 13th\r\ncentury, and the architecture of his shrine cannot be carried back\r\nbeyond the 15th century. It may even be considerably more modern. It is\r\ndisappointing to find the whole so recent in date, but there seems no\r\nexcuse for ascribing to this temple a greater antiquity than that just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIRUVALUR.\r\n\r\nThe temple at Tiruvalur, about thirty miles west of Madras, contrasts\r\ncuriously with that at Tanjore in the principles on which it was\r\ndesigned, and serves to exemplify the mode in which, unfortunately, most\r\nDravidian temples were aggregated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 193. Inner Temple at Tiruvalur.\r\n\r\nScale 200 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 194. Temple at Tiruvalur. (From a Drawing in Ram Raz’s\r\n‘Hindu Architecture’.)]\r\n\r\nThe nucleus here was a small village temple (Woodcut No. 193), drawn to\r\nthe same scale as the plan of Tanjore in Woodcut No. 190. It is a double\r\nshrine, dedicated to Siva and his consort, standing in a cloistered\r\ncourt which measures 192 ft. by 156 ft. over all, and has one gopura in\r\nfront. So far there is nothing to distinguish it from the ordinary\r\ntemples found in every village. It, however, at some subsequent period\r\nbecame sacred or rich, and a second or outer court was added, measuring\r\n470 ft. each way, with two gopuras, higher than the original one, and\r\ncontaining within its walls numberless little shrines and porches.\r\nAdditions were again made at some subsequent date, the whole being\r\nenclosed in a court 940 ft. by 701 ft.--this time with five gopuras, and\r\nseveral important shrines. When the last addition was made, it was\r\nintended to endow the temple with one of those great halls which were\r\nconsidered indispensable in temples of the first class. Generally they\r\nhad--or were intended to have--1000 columns; this one has only 688, and\r\nonly about one-half of these carry beams or a roof of any sort. There\r\ncan, however, be very little doubt that, had time and money been\r\navailable, it would have been completed to the typical extent. As it is,\r\nit is probably owing to our management of the revenues of the country\r\nthat the requisite funds were not forthcoming, and the buildings stopped\r\nprobably within the limits of the present century.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of such a design as this may be gathered from the\r\nbird’s-eye view (Woodcut No. 194). As an artistic design, nothing can be\r\nworse. The gateways, irregularly spaced in a great blank wall, lose half\r\ntheir dignity from their positions; and the bathos of their decreasing\r\nin size and elaboration, as they approach the sanctuary, is a mistake\r\nwhich nothing can redeem. We may admire beauty of detail, and be\r\nastonished at the elaboration and evidence of labour, if they are found\r\nin such a temple as this, but as an architectural design it is\r\naltogether detestable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERINGHAM.\r\n\r\nThe temple which has been most completely marred by this false system of\r\ndesign is that at Seringham, which is certainly the largest, and, if its\r\nprinciple of design could be reversed, would be one of the finest\r\ntemples in the south of India (Woodcut No. 195, p. 349). Here the\r\ncentral enclosure is quite as small and as insignificant as that at\r\nTiruvalur, and except that its dome is gilt has nothing to distinguish\r\nit from an ordinary village temple. The next enclosure, however, is more\r\nmagnificent. It encloses the hall of 1000 columns, which measures some\r\n450 ft. by 130 ft. The number of columns is, I believe, sixteen in front\r\nby sixty in depth, or 960 altogether; but I do not feel sure there is\r\nnot some mistake in my observations, and that the odd forty are to be\r\nfound somewhere. They consequently are not spaced more than 10 ft. apart\r\nfrom centre to centre; and as at one end the hall is hardly over 10 ft.\r\nhigh, and in the loftiest place only 15 ft. or 16 ft., and the pillars\r\nspaced nearly evenly over the floor, it will be easily understood how\r\nlittle effect such a building really produces. They are, however, each\r\nof a single block of granite, and all carved more or less elaborately. A\r\nmuch finer portico stretches across this court from gopura to gopura;\r\nthe pillars in it are much more widely spaced, and the central aisle is\r\ndouble that of those on the sides, and crosses the portico in the\r\ncentre, making a transept; its height, too, is double that of the side\r\naisles. It is a pleasing and graceful architectural design; the other is\r\nonly an evidence of misapplied labour. The next four enclosures have\r\nnothing very remarkable in them, being generally occupied by the\r\nBrahmans and persons connected with the temple. Each, however, has, or\r\nwas intended to have, four gopuras, one on each face, and some of these\r\nare of very considerable magnificence. The outer enclosure is,\r\npractically, a bazaar, filled with shops, where pilgrims are lodged, and\r\nfed, and fleeced. The wall that encloses it measures 2475 ft. by 2880\r\nft.,[379] and, had its gopuras been finished, they would have surpassed\r\nall others in the south to the same extent as these dimensions exceed\r\nthose of any other known temple. The northern gopura, leading to the\r\nriver and Trichinopoly, measures 130 ft. in width by 100 ft. in depth;\r\nthe opening through it measures 21 ft. 6 in., and twice that in height.\r\nThe four jambs or gateposts are each of a single slab of granite, more\r\nthan 40 ft. in height, and the roofing-slabs throughout measure from 23\r\nft. to 24 ft. Had the ordinary brick pyramid of the usual proportion\r\nbeen added to this, the whole would have risen to a height of nearly 300\r\nft. Even as it is, it is one of the most imposing masses in southern\r\nIndia, and probably--perhaps because it never was quite finished--it is\r\nin severe and good taste throughout.[380] Its date, fortunately, is\r\nperfectly well known, as its progress was stopped by its being occupied\r\nand fortified by the French during our ten years’ struggle with them for\r\nthe possession of Trichinopoly; and if we allow fifty years for its\r\nprogress, even this would bring the whole within the limits of the 18th\r\ncentury. The other three gopuras of this enclosure are in the same\r\nstyle, and were commenced on the same scale, but not being so far\r\nadvanced when we stopped the work, their gateposts project above their\r\nwalls in a manner that gives them a very singular appearance, and has\r\nled to some strange theories as to their design.\r\n\r\nLooked at from a distance, or in any direction where the whole can be\r\ngrasped at once, these fourteen or fifteen great gate towers cannot fail\r\nto produce a certain effect, as may be gathered from the view in Woodcut\r\nNo. 195; but even then it can only be by considering them as separate\r\nbuildings. As parts of one whole, their arrangement is exactly that\r\nwhich enables them to produce the least possible effect that can be\r\nobtained either from their mass or ornament. Had the four great outer\r\ngopuras formed the four sides of a central hall, and the others gone on\r\ndiminishing, in three or four directions, to the exterior, the effect of\r\nthe whole would have been increased in a surprising degree. To\r\naccomplish this, however, one\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 195. View of the eastern half of the Great Temple at\r\nSeringham. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nother defect must have been remedied: a gateway even 150 ft. wide in a\r\nwall nearly 2000 ft. in extent is a solecism nothing can redeem; but had\r\nthe walls been broken in plan or star-shaped, like the plans of\r\nChalukyan temples, light and shade would have been obtained, and due\r\nproportions of parts, without any inconvenience. But if the Dravidians\r\never had it in them to think of such things, it was not during the 17th\r\nand 18th centuries, to which everything in this temple seems to belong.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILLAMBARAM.\r\n\r\nThe temple at Chillambaram is one of the most venerated, and has also\r\nthe reputation of being one of the most ancient, temples in southern\r\nIndia. It was there, therefore, if anywhere, that I at one time hoped to\r\nfind some remains that would help to elucidate the history of the style.\r\nIt was, besides, so far removed from any capital city or frequented\r\nhaunt of man that one might hope to find its original form unaltered.\r\n\r\nIt is old, but I am afraid the traditions that connect its foundation\r\nwith Hiranya Verma of Kashmir, in the beginning of the 6th century, on\r\nwhich I was at one time inclined to rely,[381] are of too impalpable a\r\nnature to be depended upon. I see no great reason for doubting that\r\nthere may have been a connexion between the kings of Chola and those of\r\nKashmir at the period; but I cannot see anything in this temple either\r\nof so early an age, or any feature in the style of Kashmiri\r\narchitecture. On the other hand, the foundation of the temple appears to\r\nbe clearly described in the following passage of the Kongadesa Raja\r\nKal:--“Vira Chola Raya (A.D. 927 to 977) one day saw on the sea-shore\r\nthe Sabhápati of Chillambara (Siva), attended by Parvati, dancing and\r\nbeating the damaraka (a kind of drum); he therefore expended great sums\r\nof money in building the Kanaka, or Golden Sabha.”[382] A little further\r\non, it is said, “Ari Vari Deva (A.D. 1004), observing that his\r\ngrandfather had built only a Kanaka Sabhá to the Chillambara deity, he\r\nbuilt gopuras, maddals (enclosures), madapanas (image-houses), sabhás\r\n(holy places or apartments), and granted many jewels to the deity.” If\r\nthis last could be applied to the great enclosure, it would be a most\r\nimportant date; but on a careful examination of the whole circumstances\r\nof the case I feel convinced that these passages refer only to the two\r\ninner enclosures, B B, at the west end of the tank (Woodcut No. 196).\r\nThey, indeed, measuring about 320 ft. square, appear to have been the\r\nwhole of the original temple, at least in the 10th and 11th centuries,\r\nalways supposing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 196. Plan of Temple of Chillambaram.\r\n\r\n(From a Plan by Admiral Paris, in ‘Tour du Monde,’ vol. xvi. p. 35.)]\r\n\r\nthat any part of the building is really as old as this. On the whole,\r\nhowever, I am inclined to believe that this inner temple is really the\r\none referred to in the above extract. The temple of Parvati, C, on the\r\nnorth of the tank, was added afterwards, most probably in the 14th or\r\n15th century, and to that age the great gopuras and the second enclosure\r\nalso belong. The hall of 1000 columns, E, was almost certainly erected\r\nbetween 1595 and 1685, at which time, we learn from the Mackenzie MSS.,\r\nthe kings of the locality made many donations to the fane.[383] It was\r\nthen, also, in all probability, the outer enclosure was commenced; but\r\nit never was carried out, being in most places only a few feet above the\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe oldest thing now existing here is a little shrine in the inmost\r\nenclosure (opposite A in the plan), with a little porch of two pillars,\r\nabout 6 ft. high, but resting on a stylobate, ornamented with dancing\r\nfigures, more graceful and more elegantly executed than any other of\r\ntheir class, so far as I know, in southern India. At the sides are\r\nwheels and horses, the whole being intended to represent a car, as is\r\nfrequently the case in these temples. Whitewash and modern alterations\r\nhave sadly disfigured this gem, but enough remains to show how\r\nexquisite, and consequently how ancient, it was. It was dedicated to\r\nVerma, the god of dancing, in allusion, probably, to the circumstance\r\nabove mentioned as leading to the foundation of the temple.\r\n\r\nIn front of it is a shrine of very unusual architecture, with a tall\r\ncopper roof, which, I have no doubt, represents or is the golden sabhá\r\nabove referred to, and in front of this is a gopura and pillared porch,\r\nmaking up what seems to have been the temple of Vira Deva. The outer\r\nenclosure, with the buildings it contains, are, it appears, those of Ari\r\nVari.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Parvati, C, is principally remarkable for its porch, which\r\nis of singular elegance. The following woodcut (No. 197) gives some idea\r\nof its present appearance, and the section (Woodcut No. 198) explains\r\nits construction. The outer aisles are 6 ft. in width, the next 8 ft.,\r\nbut the architect reserved all his power for the central aisle, which\r\nmeasures 21 ft. 6 in. in width, making the whole 50 ft. or thereabouts.\r\nIn order to roof this without employing stones of such dimensions as\r\nwould crush the supports, recourse was had to vaulting, or rather\r\nbracketing, shafts, and these brackets were again tied together by\r\ntransverse purlins, all in stone, and the system was continued till the\r\nwidth was reduced to a dimension that could easily be spanned. As the\r\nwhole is enclosed in a court surrounded by galleries two storeys in\r\nheight, the effect of the whole is singularly pleasing.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this, across the tank, is the hall of 1000 columns, similar\r\nin many respects to that at Seringham, above described, but probably\r\nslightly more modern. Here the pillars are arranged twenty-four in front\r\nby forty-one in depth, making 984; but in order to get a central space,\r\nfour in the porch, then twenty-eight, then two, and again twenty-four,\r\nhave been omitted, altogether fifty-eight; but, on the other hand, those\r\nof the external portico must be added, which nearly balances the loss,\r\nand makes up the 1000.[384] It must be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 197. View of Porch at Chillambaram. (From Drawings by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 198. Section of Porch of Temple at Chillambaram. (From a\r\nSketch by the Author.) No Scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 199. Ruined Temple or Pagoda at Chillambaram. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nconfessed this forest of granite pillars, each of a single stone, and\r\nall more or less carved and ornamented, does produce a certain grandeur\r\nof effect, but the want of design in the arrangement, and of\r\nsubordination of parts, detract painfully from the effect that might\r\nhave been produced. Leaving out the pillars in the centre is the one\r\nredeeming feature, and that could easily have been effected without the\r\nbrick vaults, formed of radiating arches, which are employed\r\nhere--another certain proof of the modern age of the building. These\r\nvaults are certainly integral, and as certainly could not have been\r\nemployed till after the Mahomedans had settled in the south, and taught\r\nthe Hindus how to use them.\r\n\r\nAlthough this temple has been aggregated at different ages, and grown by\r\naccident rather than design like those at Tiruvalur and Seringham just\r\ndescribed, it avoids the great defect of these temples, for though like\r\nthem it has no tall central object to give dignity to the whole from the\r\noutside, internally the centre of its great court is occupied by a tank,\r\nround which the various objects are grouped without at all interfering\r\nwith one another. The temple itself is one important object, to the\r\neastward of it; the Parvati temple another, on the north, and forms a\r\npleasing pendant to the 1000-columned choultrie on the south. Alongside\r\nthe Parvati another temple was commenced (Woodcut No. 199), with a\r\nportico of square pillars, four in front, and all most elaborately\r\nornamented, but in such a manner as not to interfere with their outline\r\nor solidity.\r\n\r\nFrom its unfinished and now ruined state, it is not easy to say to whom\r\nthis temple was dedicated--most probably Soubramanya--nor to feel sure\r\nof its age. From its position, however, and the character of its\r\nornamentation, there seems little doubt that it belongs to the end of\r\nthe 17th and first half of the 18th century. From its style, I would be\r\ninclined to ascribe it to the earlier date, but in that case it is\r\ndifficult to understand its not being finished. When they had money to\r\nerect the great hall, and to commence a new enclosure, they might\r\ncertainly have spared enough to complete this solitary shrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMISSERAM.\r\n\r\nIf it were proposed to select one temple which should exhibit all the\r\nbeauties of the Dravidian style in their greatest perfection, and at the\r\nsame time exemplify all its characteristic defects of design, the choice\r\nwould almost inevitably fall on that at Ramisseram, in the island of\r\nPaumben (Woodcut No. 200). In no other temple has the same amount of\r\npatient industry been exhibited as here, and in none, unfortunately, has\r\nthat labour been so thrown away for want of a design appropriate for its\r\ndisplay. It is not that this temple has grown by successive increments\r\nlike those last described; it was begun and finished on a previously\r\nsettled plan, as regularly and as undeviatingly carried out as that at\r\nTanjore, but on a principle so diametrically opposed to it, that while\r\nthe temple at Tanjore produces an effect greater than is due to its\r\nmass or detail, this one, with double its dimensions and ten times its\r\nelaboration, produces no effect externally, and internally can only be\r\nseen in detail, so that the parts hardly in any instance aid one another\r\nin producing the effect aimed at.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 200. Plan of Great Temple at Ramisseram. Scale 170 ft. to\r\n1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe only part of the temple which is of a different age from the rest is\r\na small vimana, of very elegant proportions, that stands in the garden,\r\non the right hand of the visitor as he enters from the west[385] (D). It\r\nhas, however, been so long exposed--like the temple on the shore at\r\nMahavellipore--to the action of the sea-air, that its details are so\r\ncorroded they cannot now be made out, and its age cannot consequently be\r\nascertained from them. It is safe, however, to assert that it is more\r\nmodern than any of the rock-cut examples above quoted; possibly it may\r\nbe of the 11th or 12th century. Its dimensions may be guessed as 50 ft.\r\nin height, by 30 ft. or 40 ft. in plan, so that it hardly forms a\r\nfeature in so large a temple. From the four bulls that occupy the\r\nplatform under the dome, it is evident it was originally dedicated to\r\nSiva, as the whole temple now apparently is, though the scene of Rama’s\r\nmost celebrated exploit, and bearing his name.\r\n\r\nExternally the temple is enclosed by a wall 20 ft. in height, and\r\npossessing four gopuras, one on each face, which have this peculiarity,\r\nthat they alone, of all those I know in India, are built wholly of stone\r\nfrom the base to the summit. The western one (D) alone, however, is\r\nfinished, and owing apparently to the accident of its being in stone, it\r\nis devoid of figure-sculpture--some half-dozen plaster casts that now\r\nadorn it having been added quite recently. Those on the north and south\r\n(A and C) are hardly higher than the wall in which they stand, and are\r\nconsequently called the ruined gateways. Such a thing is, however, so\r\nfar as I know, unknown in southern India. Partly from their form, and\r\nmore from the solidity of their construction, nothing but an earthquake\r\ncould well damage them, and their age is not such as would superinduce\r\nruin from decay of material. These, in fact, have never been raised\r\nhigher, and their progress was probably stopped in the beginning of the\r\nlast century, when Mahomedan, Mahratta, and other foreign invaders\r\nchecked the prosperity of the land, and destroyed the wealth of the\r\npriesthood. The eastern façade has two entrances and two gopuras. The\r\nsmaller, not shown in the plan, is finished. The larger one (B in the\r\nplan) never was carried higher than we now see it. Had it been\r\nfinished,[386] it would have been one of the largest of its class, and\r\nbeing wholly in stone, and consequently without its outline being broken\r\nby sculpture, it would have reproduced more nearly the effect of an\r\nEgyptian propylon than any other example of its class in India.\r\n\r\nThe glory, however, of this temple resides in its corridors. These, as\r\nwill be seen by the plan, extend to nearly 4000 feet in length. The\r\nbreadth varies from 20 ft. to 30 ft. of free floor space, and their\r\nheight is apparently about 30 ft. from the floor to the centre of the\r\nroof. Each pillar or pier is compound, and richer and more elaborate in\r\ndesign than those of the Parvati porch at Chillambaram (Woodcut No.\r\n197), and are certainly more modern in date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 201. Central Corridor, Ramisseram. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of these corridors may be gathered from the\r\nannexed woodcut (No. 201), but no engraving, even on a much more\r\nextended scale, can convey the impression produced by such a display of\r\nlabour when extended to an uninterrupted length of 700 ft. None of our\r\ncathedrals are more than 500 ft., and even the nave of St. Peter’s is\r\nonly 600 ft. from the door to the apse. Here the side corridors are 700\r\nft. long, and open into transverse galleries as rich in detail as\r\nthemselves. These, with the varied devices and modes of lighting,\r\nproduce an effect that is not equalled certainly anywhere in India. The\r\nside corridors are generally free from figure-sculpture, and\r\nconsequently, from much of the vulgarity of the age to which they\r\nbelong, and, though narrower, produce a more pleasing effect. The\r\ncentral corridor leading from the sanctuary is adorned on one side by\r\nportraits of the rajas of Ramnad in the 17th century, and opposite them,\r\nof their secretaries. Even they, however, would be tolerable, were it\r\nnot that within the last few years they have been painted with a\r\nvulgarity that is inconceivable on the part of the descendants of those\r\nwho built this fane. Not only they, however, but the whole of the\r\narchitecture has first been dosed with repeated coats of whitewash, so\r\nas to take off all the sharpness of detail, and then painted with blue,\r\ngreen, red, and yellow washes, so as to disfigure and destroy its effect\r\nto an extent that must be seen to be believed. Nothing can more\r\npainfully prove the degradation to which our system has reduced the\r\npopulation than this profanity. No upper class, and consequently no\r\nrefinement, now remains, and the priesthood, instead of being high bred\r\nand intellectual Brahmans, must be sunk into a state of debasement from\r\nwhich nothing can now probably redeem them.\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, for the nonce, that this painting never had been\r\nperpetrated, still the art displayed here would be very inferior to that\r\nof such a temple as, for instance, Hullabîd, in the Mysore, to be\r\ndescribed further on. The perimeter, however, of that temple is only 700\r\nft.; here we have corridors extending to 4000 ft., carved on both sides,\r\nand in the hardest granite. It is the immensity of the labour here\r\ndisplayed that impresses us, much more than its quality, and that,\r\ncombined with a certain picturesqueness and mystery, does produce an\r\neffect which is not surpassed by any other temple in India, and by very\r\nfew elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe age of this temple is hardly doubtful. From first to last its\r\nstyle--excepting the old vimana--is so uniform and unaltered that its\r\nerection could hardly have lasted during a hundred years, and if this is\r\nso, it must have been during the 17th century, when the Ramnad rajas\r\nwere at the height of their independence and prosperity, and when their\r\nally or master, Tirumulla Nayak, was erecting buildings in the same\r\nidentical style at Mádura. It may have been commenced fifty years\r\nearlier (1550), and the erection of its gopuras may have extended into\r\nthe 18th century, but these seem the possible limits of deviation. Being\r\nso recent, any one on the spot could easily ascertain the facts. They\r\ncould indeed be determined very nearly from the photographs, were it not\r\nfor the whitewash and paint, which so disfigure the details as to make\r\nthem almost unrecognisable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMÁDURA.\r\n\r\nIf the native authorities consulted by the late Professor Wilson in\r\ncompiling his Historical sketch of the Kingdom of Pándya could be relied\r\nupon, it would seem that the foundation of the dynasty ought to be\r\nplaced some five or six centuries before the Christian Era.[387] Even,\r\nhowever, if this is disputed, the fact of the southern part of the\r\nPeninsula being described as the “Regio Pandionis” by classical\r\nauthorities is sufficient to prove that a kingdom bearing that name did\r\nexist there in the early centuries of the Christian Era. Their first\r\ncapitals, however, seem to have been Kurkhi, possibly the Kolkhi of the\r\nPeriplus, near Ramnad, and Kalyana, near Cape Comorin. The story of Kula\r\nSekhara founding Mádura, and the fabulous incidents with which the tale\r\nis adorned, is one of the favourite legends of the south, and is\r\nabundantly illustrated in sculptures of Tirumulla Nayak’s choultrie and\r\nin other buildings of the capital.\r\n\r\nFor our present purposes it is hardly worth while to attempt to\r\ninvestigate the succession of the dates of the seventy-three kings who\r\nare said to have succeeded one another before the accession of the Nayak\r\nor Naik dynasty, in 1532, inasmuch as no building is now known to exist\r\nin the kingdom that can claim, even on the most shadowy grounds, to have\r\nbeen erected by any of these kings. It may have been that, anterior to\r\nthe rise of the great Chola dynasty, in the 10th and 11th century, that\r\nof Mádura may have had a long period of prosperity and power; but\r\ncertain it is, that if they did build anything of importance, its\r\nexistence cannot now be identified. After that, for a while they seem to\r\nhave been subjected to the Bellala dynasty of the Mysore, and the same\r\nMahomedan invasion that destroyed that power in 1310 spread its baneful\r\ninfluence as far as Ramnad, and for two centuries their raids and\r\noppressions kept the whole of southern India in a state of anarchy and\r\nconfusion. Their power for evil was first checked by the rise of the\r\ngreat Hindu state of Vijayanagar, in the Tongabhadra, in the 14th\r\ncentury, and by the establishment, under its protection, of the Nayak\r\ndynasty by Viswanath Nayak, in the beginning of the 16th. After lasting\r\n210 years, the last sovereign of the race--a queen--was first aided, and\r\nthen betrayed, by Chanda Sahib the Nawaub of the Carnatic, who plays so\r\nimportant a part in our wars with the French in these parts.\r\n\r\nIt may be--indeed, probably is the case--that there are temples in the\r\nprovinces that were erected before the rise of the Nayak dynasty, but\r\ncertain it is that all those in the capital, with the great temple at\r\nSeringham, described above, were erected during the two centuries of\r\ntheir supremacy, and of those in the capital nine-tenths at least were\r\nerected during the long and prosperous reign of the tenth king of this\r\ndynasty, Tirumulla Nayak, or as he is more popularly known, Trimul Naik,\r\nwho reigned from 1621 to 1657.[388]\r\n\r\nOf his buildings, the most important, for our purposes[389] at least,\r\nis\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 202. Plan of Tirumulla Nayak’s Choultrie. (From a Drawing\r\nin the possession of the Royal Asiatic Society.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 203. Pillar in Tirumulla Nayak’s Choultrie. (From a\r\nDrawing in the possession of the Royal Asiatic Society.)]\r\n\r\nthe celebrated choultrie which he built for the reception of the\r\npresiding deity of the place, who consented to leave his dark cell in\r\nthe temple and pay the king an annual visit of ten days’ duration, on\r\ncondition of his building a hall worthy of his dignity, and where he\r\ncould receive in a suitable manner the homage of the king and his\r\nsubjects. As will be seen from the plan (Woodcut No. 202) the hall is\r\n333 ft. long by 105 ft. in width, measured on the stylobate, and\r\nconsists of four ranges of columns, all of which are different, and all\r\nmost elaborately sculptured. An elevation of one is given (Woodcut No.\r\n203), but is not so rich as those of the centre, which have life-sized\r\nfigures attached to them, and are even more elaborate in their details.\r\nIn this instance it will be observed that the detached bracketing shaft\r\nat Chillambaram has become attached to the square central pier, and\r\ninstead of the light elegance that characterised that example, has\r\nbecome a solid pier, five or six feet in depth--richer certainly, but\r\nfar from being either so elegant or so appropriate as the earlier\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe view of the interior (Woodcut No. 204) gives some, but only a faint,\r\nidea of the effect. The sides are now closed with screens, and it is\r\ndifficult to procure good photographs; but in effect, as in detail, it\r\nis identical with the corridors at Ramisseram, where the light is\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nAs the date of this hall is perfectly well known--it took twenty-two\r\nyears to erect it, 1623 to 1645--it becomes a fixed point in our\r\nchronology of the style. We can, for instance, assert with perfect\r\ncertainty that the porch to Parvati’s shrine at Chillambaram (Woodcut\r\nNo. 197) is certainly anterior to this, probably by a couple of\r\ncenturies, and, with equal certainty that the corridors at Ramisseram\r\nare contemporary. From the history of the period we learn that the rajas\r\nof Ramnad were at times independent, at others at war with the Nayaks;\r\nbut in Tirumulla Nayak’s time either his allies or dependants; and the\r\nstyle and design of the two buildings are so absolutely identical that\r\nthey must belong to the same age. It is, indeed, most probable that the\r\nking of Mádura may have assisted in the erection of the temple. If he\r\nhad indeed been allowed any share in making the original design, the\r\ntemple would probably have been a nobler building than it is; for,\r\nthough the details are the same, his three-aisled hall leading to the\r\nsanctuary would have been a far grander feature architecturally than the\r\nsingled-aisled corridors that lead nowhere. The expense of one of the\r\nsingle-aisled corridors at Ramisseram, 700 ft. long, would have been\r\nabout the same as the triple-aisled choultrie at Mádura, which is half\r\ntheir length. If, consequently, the choultrie cost a million\r\nsterling--as is confidently asserted--the temple must have cost between\r\nthree and four millions; and such an estimate hardly seems excessive\r\nwhen we consider the amount of labour expended on it, and that the\r\nmaterial in both is the hardest granite.\r\n\r\nThe façade of this hall, like that of almost all the great halls in the\r\nsouth of India, is adorned either with Yalis--monsters of the lion type\r\ntrampling on an elephant--or, even more generally, by a group consisting\r\nof a warrior sitting on a rearing horse, whose feet are supported on the\r\nshields of foot soldiers, sometimes slaying men, sometimes tigers. These\r\ngroups are found literally in hundreds in southern India, and, as works\r\nexhibiting difficulties overcome by patient labour, they are unrivalled,\r\nso far as I know, by anything found elsewhere. As works of art, they are\r\nthe most barbarous, it may be said the most\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 204. View in Tirumulla Nayak’s Choultrie, Mádura. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nvulgar, to be found in India, and do more to shake one’s faith in the\r\ncivilization of the people who produced them than anything they did in\r\nany other department of art. Where these monstrosities are not\r\nintroduced, the pillars of entrances are only enriched a little more\r\nthan those of the interior, when the ornamentation is in better taste,\r\nand generally quite sufficiently rich for its purpose.\r\n\r\nImmediately in front of his choultrie, Tirumulla Nayak commenced a\r\ngopura, which, had he lived to complete it, would probably have been the\r\nfinest edifice of its class in southern India. It measures 174 ft. from\r\nnorth to south, and 107[390] ft. in depth. The entrance through it is 21\r\nft. 9 in. wide; and if it be true that its gateposts are 60 ft. (Tripe\r\nsays 57 ft.) in height, that would have been the height of the\r\nopening.[391] It will thus be seen that it was designed on even a larger\r\nscale than that at Seringham, described above, and it certainly far\r\nsurpasses that celebrated edifice in the beauty of its details. Its\r\ndoorposts alone, whether 57 ft. or 60 ft. in height, are single blocks\r\nof granite, carved with the most exquisite scroll patterns of elaborate\r\nfoliage, and all the other carvings are equally beautiful. Being\r\nunfinished, and consequently never consecrated, it has escaped\r\nwhitewash, and alone, of all the buildings of Mádura, its beauties can\r\nstill be admired in their original perfection.\r\n\r\nThe great temple at Mádura is a larger and far more important building\r\nthan the choultrie; but, somehow or other, it has not attracted the\r\nattention of travellers to the same extent that the latter has. No one\r\nhas ever attempted to make a plan of it, or to describe it in such\r\ndetail as would enable others to understand its peculiarities. It\r\npossesses, however, all the characteristics of a first-class Dravidian\r\ntemple, and, as its date is perfectly well known, it forms a landmark of\r\nthe utmost value in enabling us to fix the relative date of other\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\nThe sanctuary is said to have been built by Viswanath, the first king of\r\nthe Nayak dynasty, A.D. 1520, which may possibly be the case; but the\r\ntemple itself certainly owes all its magnificence to Tirumulla Nayak,\r\nA.D. 1622-1657, or to his elder brother, Muttu Virappa, who preceded\r\nhim, and who built a mantapa, said to be the oldest thing now existing\r\nhere. The Kalyana mantapa is said to have been built A.D. 1707, and the\r\nTatta Suddhi in 1770. These, however, are insignificant parts compared\r\nwith those which certainly owe their origin to Tirumulla Nayak.\r\n\r\nThe temple itself is a nearly regular rectangle, two of its sides\r\nmeasuring 720 ft. and 729 ft., the other two 834 ft. and 852 ft. It\r\npossessed four gopuras of the first class, and five smaller ones; a very\r\nbeautiful tank, surrounded by arcades; and a hall of 1000 columns, whose\r\nsculptures surpass those of any other hall of its class I am acquainted\r\nwith. There is a small shrine, dedicated to the goddess Minakshi, the\r\ntutelary deity of the place, which occupies the space of fifteen\r\ncolumns, so the real number is only 985; but it is not their number but\r\ntheir marvellous elaboration that makes it the wonder of the place, and\r\nrenders it, in some respects, more remarkable than the choultrie about\r\nwhich so much has been said and written. I do not feel sure that this\r\nhall alone is not a greater work than the choultrie; taken in\r\nconjunction with the other buildings of the temple, it certainly forms a\r\nfar more imposing group.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the great Vaishnava temple at Seringham owes all its\r\nmagnificence to buildings erected during the reign of the Nayak dynasty,\r\nwhose second capital was Trichinopoly, and where they often resided.\r\nWithin a mile, however, of that much-lauded temple is another, dedicated\r\nto Siva, under the title of Jumbúkeswara, which, though not so large as\r\nthat dedicated to Sri Rangam, far surpasses it in beauty as an\r\narchitectural object. The first gateway of the outer enclosure is not\r\nlarge, but it leads direct to the centre of a hall containing some 400\r\npillars. On the right these open on a tank fed by a perpetual spring,\r\nwhich is one of the wonders of the place.[392] The corresponding space\r\non the left was intended to be occupied by the 600 columns requisite to\r\nmake up the 1000, but this never was completed. Between the two gopuras\r\nof the second enclosure is a very beautiful portico of cruciform shape,\r\nleading to the door of the sanctuary, which, however, makes no show\r\nexternally, and access to its interior is not vouchsafed to the\r\nprofane.[393] The age of this temple is the same as that of its great\r\nrival, except that, being all of one design, it probably was begun and\r\ncompleted at once, and from the simplicity of its parts and details may\r\nbe earlier than the great buildings of Tirumulla Nayak. If we assume\r\nA.D. 1600, with a margin of ten or fifteen years either way, we shall\r\nprobably not err much in its date.\r\n\r\nOne of the great charms of this temple, when I visited it, was its\r\npurity. Neither whitewash nor red nor yellow paint had then sullied it,\r\nand the time-stain on the warm-coloured granite was all that relieved\r\nits monotony; but it sufficed, and it was a relief to contemplate it\r\nthus after some of the vulgarities I had seen. Now all this is altered.\r\nLike the pagodas at Ramisseram, and more so those at Mádura, barbarous\r\nvulgarity has done its worst, and the traveller is only too fully\r\njustified in the contempt with which he speaks of these works of a great\r\npeople which have fallen into the hands of such unworthy successors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINNEVELLY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 205. Half-plan of Temple at Tinnevelly. (From a Plan in\r\nthe possession of the Royal Asiatic Society.)\r\n\r\nScale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThough neither among the largest nor the most splendid temples of\r\nsouthern India, that at Tinnevelly will serve to give a good general\r\nidea of the arrangement of these edifices, and has the advantage of\r\nhaving been built on one plan, and at one time, without subsequent\r\nalteration or change. Like the little cell in the Tiruvalur temple\r\n(Woodcut No. 193), it has the singularity of being a double temple, the\r\ngreat square being divided into equal portions, of which one is\r\ndedicated to the god Siva, the other to his consort Parvati. The\r\npreceding plan (Woodcut No. 205) represents one of the halves, which,\r\nthough differing in arrangement from the other, is still so like it as\r\nto make the representation and description of one sufficient for both.\r\n\r\nThe general dimensions of the whole enclosure are 508 ft. by 756 ft.,\r\nthe larger dimension being divided into two equal portions of 378 ft.\r\neach. There are three gateways to each half, and one in the wall\r\ndividing the two; the principal gateway faces the entrance to the\r\ntemple, and the lateral ones are opposite each other. An outer portico\r\nprecedes the great gateway, leading internally to a very splendid porch,\r\nwhich, before reaching the gateway of the inner enclosure, branches off\r\non the right to the intermediate gateway, and on the left to the great\r\nhall of 1000 columns--10 pillars in width by 100 in depth.\r\n\r\nThe inner enclosure is not concentric with the outer, and, as usual, has\r\nonly one gateway. The temple itself consists of a cubical cell,\r\nsurmounted by a vimana or spire, preceded by two porches, and surrounded\r\nby triple colonnades. In other parts of the enclosure are smaller\r\ntemples, tanks of water, gardens, colonnades, &c., but neither so\r\nnumerous nor so various as are generally found in Indian temples of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe great 1000-pillared portico in the temple is one of the least poetic\r\nof its class in India. It consists of a regiment of pillars 10 deep and\r\nextending to 100 in length, without any break or any open space or\r\narrangement. Such a forest of pillars does, no doubt, produce a certain\r\neffect; but half that number, if arranged as in some of the Chalukyan or\r\nJaina temples, would produce a far nobler impression. The aim of the\r\nDravidians seems to have been to force admiration by the mere exhibition\r\nof inordinate patient toil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBACONUM.\r\n\r\nIf the traditions of the natives could be trusted, Combaconum--one of\r\nthe old capitals of the Chola dynasty--is one of the places where we\r\nmight hope to find something very ancient. There are fragments of older\r\ntemples, indeed, to be found everywhere, but none _in situ_. All the\r\nolder buildings seem to have been at some time ruined and rebuilt,\r\nprobably on the same site, but with that total disregard to antiquity\r\nwhich is characteristic of the Hindus in all ages. One portico, in a\r\ntemple dedicated to Sri Rama, is very like that leading\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 206. Gopura at Combaconum. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nfrom the second to the third gopura in the temple of Jumbúkeswara,\r\ndescribed above, but, if anything, it is slightly more modern. There is\r\nalso one fine gopura in the town, represented in the last woodcut (No.\r\n206). It is small, however, in comparison with those we have just been\r\ndescribing, being only 84 ft. across and about 130 ft. in height. Those\r\nof Seringham and Mádura have, or were intended to have, at least double\r\nthese dimensions.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a richly-ornamented example of its class, and the\r\npreceding woodcut conveys a fair impression of the effect of these\r\nbuildings generally. It is not old enough to be quite of the best age,\r\nbut it is still not so modern as to have lost all the character and\r\nexpression of the earlier examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONJEVERAM.\r\n\r\nConjeveram is another city where tradition would lead us to expect more\r\nof antiquity than in almost any city of the south. It is said to have\r\nbeen founded by Adondai, the illegitimate son of Kolotunga Chola, in the\r\n11th or 12th century, and to have succeeded Combaconum as the capital of\r\nthe Chola Mandalam. Even before this, however, it is supposed to have\r\nbeen inhabited by Buddhists,[394] and that they were succeeded by Jains.\r\nIf this is so, all that can be said is, that neither of these religions\r\nhave left any traces of their existence on the spot, and many passages\r\nin the Mackenzie MSS. would lead us to suppose that it was a jungle\r\ninhabited by savage Kurumbars when the Cholas took possession of it.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the two towns, Great and Little Conjeveram, possess\r\ngroups of temples as picturesque and nearly as vast as any to be found\r\nelsewhere. The great temple at the first-named place possesses some\r\nfirst-class gopuras, though no commanding vimana. It has, too, a hall of\r\n1000 columns, several large and fine mantapas, large tanks with flights\r\nof stone steps, and all the requisites of a first-class Dravidian\r\ntemple, but all thrown together as if by accident. No two gopuras are\r\nopposite one another, no two walls parallel, and there is hardly a right\r\nangle about the place. All this creates a picturesqueness of effect\r\nseldom surpassed in these temples, but deprives it of that dignity we\r\nmight expect from such parts if properly arranged.\r\n\r\nThere may be some part I did not see[395] which may be older, but\r\ncertainly none of the principal buildings are so old as Parvati’s shrine\r\nat Chillambaram, but all seem equally to be anterior to the great\r\nbuilding epoch of the Nayak dynasty. They probably are the last efforts\r\nof the Cholas; but here, again, whitewash and red paint have done so\r\nmuch to obliterate the record, that it is not safe to dogmatise\r\nregarding the age of any buildings in either of the two Conjeverams.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELLORE AND PEROOR.\r\n\r\nAlthough the temples at Vellore and at Peroor, near Coimbatore, can only\r\nrank among the second class as regards size, they possess porticos of\r\nextreme interest to architectural history, and are consequently worthy\r\nof more attention than has been bestowed upon them. That at Vellore,\r\nhowever, is unfortunately situated in the fort occupied by the British,\r\nand has consequently been utilised as a store. Walls have been built\r\nbetween its piers, and whitewash and fittings have reduced it to that\r\ncondition which we think appropriate for the noblest works of art in\r\nIndia. Enough, however, still remains to enable us to see that it is one\r\nof the most elegant as well as one of the oldest porches or mantapas in\r\nthe south. As will be seen from the woodcut (No. 207), the Yalis and\r\nrearing horsemen are clearly and sharply cut, and far from being so\r\nextravagant as they sometimes are. The great cornice too, with its\r\ndouble flexures and its little trellice-work of supports, is not only\r\nvery elegant in form, but one of those marvels of patient industry, such\r\nas are to be found hardly anywhere else. There are many such cornices,\r\nhowever, in the south: one at Avadea Covill is deeper and more elaborate\r\nthan even this one. The outer facing there is said to be only about an\r\ninch in thickness, and its network of supports is more elaborate and\r\nmore delicate than those at Vellore, though it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how either was ever executed in so hard a material. The\r\ntraditions of the place assign the erection of the Vellore porch to the\r\nyear 1350, and though this is perhaps being too precise, it is not far\r\nfrom the truth. The bracket shafts (Woodcut No. 208) are similar but\r\neven more elegant than those in Parvati’s porch at Chillambaram; but\r\nthey are--some of them at least--attached to the pier by very elegant\r\nopen-work, such as is found in Pratapa Rudra’s temple at Worangul\r\n(Woodcut No. 217) or in the windows at Hullabîd. As both these examples\r\nare earlier than 1300, it might seem that this one was so also, but it\r\nis difficult to feel certain when comparing buildings so distant in\r\nlocality, and belonging to different styles of art. On the whole,\r\nhowever, I am inclined to believe that between 1300 and 1400 will be\r\nfound the true date of this porch.\r\n\r\nThe date of the porch at Peroor is ascertained within narrow limits by\r\nthe figure of a Sepoy loading a musket being carved on the base of one\r\nof its pillars, and his costume and the shape of his arm are exactly\r\nthose we find in contemporary pictures of the wars of Aurungzebe, or the\r\nearly Mahrattas, in the beginning of the 18th century. As shown in\r\nWoodcut No. 209, the bracket shafts are there attached to the piers as\r\nin Tirumulla Nayak’s buildings, and though the general character of the\r\narchitecture is the same, there is a coarseness in the details, and a\r\nmarked inferiority in the figure-sculpture, that betrays the distance of\r\ndate between these two examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 207. Portico of Temple at Vellore.]\r\n\r\nSlight as the difference may appear to the unpractised eye, it is within\r\nthe four centuries that include the dates of these two buildings (1350\r\nto 1750) that practically the whole history of the Dravidian\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 208. Compound Pillar at Vellore. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 209. Compound Pillar at Peroor. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\ntemple architecture is included. There are rock-cut examples before the\r\nfirst date, and some structural buildings in Dharwar on a smaller scale,\r\nwhich are older, but it is safe to assert that nine-tenths, at least, or\r\nmore, of those which are found south of the Tongabhadra, were erected\r\nbetween these dates.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not meant to assert that, before the first of these\r\ndates, there were not structural temples in the south of India. So far\r\nfrom this being the case, it seems nearly certain that during the six or\r\nseven centuries that elapsed between the carving of the rocks at\r\nMahavellipore and the erection of the Vellore pagoda, numerous buildings\r\nmust have been erected in order that a style should be elaborated and so\r\nfixed that it should endure for five centuries afterwards, with so\r\nlittle change, and with only that degradation in detail, which is the\r\nfatal characteristic of art in India.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible that the horsemen, the Yalis, and above all, the\r\ngreat cornice of double curvature, shown in the woodcut (No. 207), could\r\nhave been brought to these fixed forms without long experience, and the\r\ndifficulty is to understand how they could ever have been elaborated in\r\nstone at all, as they are so unlike lithic forms found anywhere else;\r\nyet they are not wooden, nor is there any trace in them of any of their\r\ndetails being derived from wooden architecture, as is so evidently the\r\ncase with the Buddhist architecture of the north. The one suggestion\r\nthat occurs to me is that they are derived from terra-cotta forms.\r\nFrequently, at the present day, figures of men on horseback larger than\r\nlife, or of giants on foot, are seen near the village temples made of\r\npottery, their hollow forms of burnt clay, and so burnt as to form a\r\nperfect terra-cotta substance. Most of the figures also on the gopuras\r\nare not in plaster as is generally said, but are also formed of clay\r\nburnt. The art has certainly been long practised in the south, and if we\r\nadopt the theory that it was used for many ornamental purposes before\r\nwood or stone, it will account for much that is otherwise unintelligible\r\nin the arts of the south.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIJAYANAGAR.\r\n\r\nThe dates just quoted will no doubt sound strange and prosaic to those\r\nwho are accustomed to listen to the childish exaggerations of the\r\nBrahmans in speaking of the age of their temples. There is, however,\r\nluckily a test besides the evidence above quoted, which, if it could be\r\nperfectly applied, would settle the question at once.\r\n\r\nWhen in the beginning of the 14th century the Mahomedans from Delhi\r\nfirst made their power seriously felt in the south, they struck down the\r\nkingdom of the Hoisala Bellalas in 1310, and destroyed their capital of\r\nHullabîd; and in 1322 Worangul, which had been previously attacked, was\r\nfinally destroyed, and it is said they then carried their victorious\r\narms as far as Ramnad. The Mahomedans did not, however, at that time\r\nmake any permanent settlement in the south, and the consequence was,\r\nthat as soon as the Hindus were able to recover from the panic, Bukka\r\nand Harihara, princes it is said of the deposed house of Worangul,\r\ngathered around them the remnants of the destroyed states, and founded a\r\nnew state in the town of Vijayanagar on the Tongabhadra. An earlier city\r\nit is said had been founded there in 1118, by a Vijaya Rayal, but only\r\nas a dependency of the Mysore Raj, and there is consequently no reason\r\nfor supposing that any of the buildings in the city belong to that\r\nperiod, nor indeed till the new dynasty founded by Bukka had\r\nconsolidated its power, which was certainly not before the beginning of\r\nthe 15th century.\r\n\r\nThe city was finally destroyed by the Mahomedans in 1565, but during the\r\ntwo previous centuries it maintained a gallant struggle against the\r\nBahmuny and Adil Shahi dynasties of Kalburgah and Bijapur, and was in\r\nfact the barrier that prevented the Moslems from taking possession of\r\nthe whole country as far as Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\nIts time of greatest prosperity was between the accession of Krishna\r\nDeva, 1508, and the death of Achutya Rayal, 1542, and it is to their\r\nreigns that the finest monuments in the city must be ascribed. There is,\r\nperhaps, no other city in all India in which ruins exist in such\r\nprofusion or in such variety as in Vijayanagar, and as they are all\r\ncertainly comprised within the century and a half, or at the utmost the\r\ntwo centuries, that preceded the destruction of the city, their\r\nanalogies afford us dates that hardly admit of dispute.\r\n\r\nAmong those in the city the most remarkable is that dedicated to Vitoba,\r\na local manifestation of Vishnu. It was erected by Achutya Rayal, A.D.\r\n1529-1542, and never was finished; and if it were not that no successor\r\never cares in India to complete the works begun by his predecessor, we\r\nmight fancy the works were interrupted by the siege. The principal part\r\nof the temple consists of a porch, represented in the annexed woodcut\r\n(No. 210). It is wholly in granite, and carved with a boldness and\r\nexpression of power nowhere surpassed in the buildings of its\r\nclass.[396] As will be observed, it has all the characteristic\r\npeculiarities of the Dravidian style: the bold cornice of double\r\nflexure, the detached shafts, the Yalis, the richly-carved stylobate,\r\n&c. But what interests us most here is that it forms an exact half-way\r\nhouse in style between such porches as those at Vellore and\r\nChillambaram, and that of Tirumulla Nayak at Mádura. The bracket shafts\r\nare detached here, it is true, but they are mere ornaments, and have\r\nlost their meaning. The cornice is as bold as any, but has lost its\r\ncharacteristic supports, and other changes have been made, which would\r\ninevitably have led in a short time to the new style of the Nayak\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 210. View of Porch of Temple of Vitoba at Vijayanagar.\r\n(From a Photograph by Mr. Neill.)]\r\n\r\nThe little building on the right is the car of the god, formed of a\r\nsingle block of granite, with movable wheels, but they are the only\r\nparts that move. There are, besides, either one or two pavilions,\r\nsmaller, but similar in design to that represented in the woodcut, a\r\ngopura, and other adjuncts, which would be interesting, if we had the\r\nmeans of comparing and describing them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the temple of Vitoba is certainly one of the most remarkable\r\nruins in India, and there are other temples of great beauty and extent\r\nin the capital, it is not quite clear that it is there the\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_ of this dynasty are to be found, but rather at a place\r\ncalled Tarputry, about one hundred miles a little east of south from the\r\ncapital. There are two temples there: the one now in use, dedicated to\r\nVishnu, is the elder, and in so far as whitewash and paint will allow\r\none to judge, ranges with the works of the earliest kings of the\r\nVijayanagar dynasty; but the wonders of the place are two gopuras\r\nbelonging to a now deserted temple on the banks of the river, about a\r\nquarter of a mile from the others. One of these was apparently quite\r\nfinished, the other never carried higher than the perpendicular part. In\r\nalmost all the gopuras of India this part is comparatively plain, all\r\nthe figure-sculpture and ornament being reserved for the upper or\r\npyramidal part. In this instance, however, the whole of the\r\nperpendicular part is covered with the most elaborate sculpture, cut\r\nwith exquisite sharpness and precision, in a fine close-grained\r\nhornblende (?) stone, and produces an effect richer, and on the whole\r\nperhaps in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 211. Entrance through Gopura at Tarputry. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 212. Portion of Gopura at Tarputry. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nbetter taste, than anything else in this style (Woodcuts Nos. 211, 212).\r\nIt is difficult of course to institute a comparison between these\r\ngopuras and such works as Tirumulla Nayak’s choultrie, or the corridors\r\nat Ramisseram; they are so different that there is no common basis of\r\ncomparison but the vulgar one of cost; but if compared with Hullabîd or\r\nBaillûr, these Tarputry gopuras stand that test better than any other\r\nworks of the Vijayanagar Rajas. They are inferior, but not so much so as\r\none would expect from the two centuries of decadence that elapsed\r\nbetween them, and they certainly show a marked superiority over the\r\ngreat unfinished gopura of Tirumulla Nayak, which was commenced, as\r\nnearly as may be, one century afterwards.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty miles still further east, at a place called Diggu Hublum,\r\nthere is a large unfinished mantapa, in plan and design very like that\r\nof the temple of Vitoba at Vijayanagar, but its style and details are so\r\nmuch more like those of the Nayaks, that it must be at least a century\r\nmore modern, and could not therefore have been erected before the\r\ndestruction of that capital in A.D. 1565. The dynasty, however,\r\ncontinued to exist for one or two centuries after that time, till the\r\ncountry was finally conquered by Tipu Sultan. It must have been by one\r\nof the expatriated rajas that this temple was erected, but by whom even\r\ntradition is silent. Whoever may have built it, it is a fine bold\r\nspecimen of architecture, and if the history of the art in the south of\r\nIndia is ever seriously taken up, it will worthily take a place in the\r\nseries as one of the best specimens of its age, wanting the delicacy and\r\nelegance of the earlier examples, but full of character and merit.[397]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe buildings mentioned, and more or less perfectly described, in the\r\npreceding pages are in number rather more than one-third of the great\r\nDravidian temples known to exist in the province. In importance and\r\nextent they certainly are, however, more than one-half. Of the\r\nremainder, none have vimanas, like that of Tanjore, nor corridors, like\r\nthose of Ramisseram; but several have gopuras quite equal to or\r\nexceeding those mentioned above, and many have mantapas of great beauty\r\nand extent. Several--such as Avadea Covill, Veeringepuram, Taramungulam,\r\nand others--possess features unsurpassed by any in the south, especially\r\nthe first-named, which may, perhaps, be considered as one of the most\r\nelegant of its class, as well as one of the oldest. It would, however,\r\nbe only tedious to attempt to describe them without plans to refer to,\r\nor more extensive illustrations than are compatible with a work of this\r\nclass. They are, however, worthy of more attention than has been paid to\r\nthem, and of more complete illustration than has hitherto been bestowed\r\nupon them. Taken altogether, they certainly do form as extensive, and in\r\nsome respects as remarkable, a group of buildings as are to be found in\r\nprovinces of similar extent in any part of the world--Egypt, perhaps,\r\nalone excepted; but they equal even the Egyptian in extent, and though\r\nat first sight so different, in some respects present similarities which\r\nare startling. Without attempting to enumerate the whole, it may be\r\nmentioned that the gopuras, both in form and purpose, resemble the\r\npylons of the Egyptian temples. The courts with pillars and cloisters\r\nare common to both, and very similar in arrangement and extent. The\r\ngreat mantapas and halls of 1000 columns reproduce the hypostyle halls,\r\nboth in purpose and effect, with almost minute accuracy. The absence of\r\nany central tower or vimana over the sanctuary is universal in Egypt,\r\nand only conspicuously violated in one instance in India. Their mode of\r\naggregation, and the amount of labour bestowed upon them for labour’s\r\nsake, is only too characteristic of both styles. There are, besides,\r\nmany similarities that will occur to any one familiar with both styles.\r\n\r\nIs all this accidental? It seems strange that so many coincidences\r\nshould be fortuitous, but, so far as history affords us any information,\r\nor as any direct communication can be traced, we must for the present\r\nanswer that it is so. The interval of time is so great, and the mode in\r\nwhich we fancy we can trace the native growth of most of the features in\r\nIndia seem to negative the idea of an importation; but there certainly\r\nwas intercourse between Egypt and India in remote ages, and seed may\r\nthen have been sown which fructified long afterwards.\r\n\r\nIf we were to trust, however, to either tradition or to mythological or\r\nethnological coincidences, it is rather to Babylonia than to Egypt that\r\nwe should look for the _incunabula_ of what are found in southern India.\r\nBut here the architectural argument is far from having the same\r\ndistinctness; and, in fact, whichever way we turn, we are forced to\r\nconfess that these problems are not yet ripe for solution, though enough\r\nis known to encourage the hope that the time is not distant when\r\nmaterials will be gathered that will make all clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCIVIL ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nPalaces at Mádura and Tanjore--Garden Pavilion at Vijayanagar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, like all nations of Turanian race, the Dravidians were\r\nextensive and enthusiastic builders, it is somewhat singular that till\r\nthey came in contact with the Mahomedans all their efforts in this\r\ndirection should have been devoted to the service of religion. No trace\r\nof any civil or municipal building is to be found anywhere, though from\r\nthe stage of civilization that they had attained it might be expected\r\nthat such must have existed. What is, however, even more remarkable is,\r\nthat kingdoms always at war with one another, and contending for\r\nsupremacy within a limited area, might have been expected to develop\r\nsome sort of military architecture. So far, however, as is now known, no\r\ncastle or fortification of any sort dates from the Pandya, Chera, or\r\nChola days. What is still more singular in a people of Turanian blood\r\nis, that they have no tombs. They seem always to have burnt their dead,\r\nand never to have collected their ashes or raised any mounds or\r\nmemorials to their departed friends or great men. There are, it is true,\r\nnumberless “Rude stone monuments” all over the south of India, but, till\r\nthey are more thoroughly investigated, it is impossible to say whether\r\nthey belong to the Dravidians when in a lower stage of civilization than\r\nwhen they became temple builders, or whether they belong to other\r\nunderlying races who still exist, in scattered fragments, all over the\r\nsouth of India, in a state bordering on that of savages.[398] Whoever\r\nthese Dolmens or stone circles may have belonged to, we know, at least,\r\nthat they never were developed into architectural objects, such as would\r\nbring them within the scope of this work. No Dravidian tomb or cenotaph\r\nis known to exist anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the Dravidians came in contact with the Mussulmans this\r\nstate of affairs was entirely altered, in so far, at least, as civil\r\nbuildings were concerned. The palaces, the kutcherries, the\r\nelephant-stables, and the dependencies of the abodes of the rajas at\r\nVijayanagar and Mádura, rival in extent and in splendour the temples\r\nthemselves, and are not surpassed in magnificence by the Mahomedan\r\npalaces of Bijapur or Bidar.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting peculiarities of these civil buildings is,\r\nthat they are all in a new and different style of architecture from that\r\nemployed in the temples, and the distinction between the civil and\r\nreligious art is kept up to the present day. The civil buildings are all\r\nin what we would call a pointed-arched Moorish style--picturesque in\r\neffect, if not always in the best taste, and using the arch everywhere\r\nand for every purpose. In the temples the arch is never used as an\r\narchitectural feature. In some places, in modern times, when they wanted\r\na larger internal space than could be obtained by bracketing without\r\ngreat expense, a brick vault was introduced,--it may be said\r\nsurreptitiously--for it is always concealed. Even now, in building\r\ngopuras, they employ wooden beams, supported by pillars, as lintels, to\r\ncover the central openings in the upper pyramidal part, and this having\r\ndecayed, many of the most modern exhibit symptoms of decay which are not\r\nobservable in the older examples, where a stone lintel always was\r\nemployed. But it is not only in construction that the Dravidians adhere\r\nto their old forms in temples. There are, especially, some gopuras\r\nerected within the limits of this century, and erecting even now, which\r\nit requires a practised eye to distinguish from older examples; but with\r\nthe civil buildings the case is quite different. It is not, indeed,\r\nclear how a convenient palace could be erected in the trabeate style of\r\nthe temples, unless, indeed, wood was very extensively employed, both in\r\nthe supports and the roofs. My conviction is, that this really was the\r\ncase, and its being so, to a great extent, at least, accounts for their\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nThe principal apartments in the palace at Mádura are situated round a\r\ncourtyard which measures 244 ft. east and west by 142 ft. north and\r\nsouth, surrounded on all sides by arcades of very great beauty. The\r\npillars which support the arches are of stone, 40 ft. in height, and are\r\njoined by foliated brick arcades of great elegance of design. The whole\r\nof the ornamentation is worked out in the exquisitely fine stucco called\r\n“chunan,” or shell lime, which is a characteristic of the Madras\r\nPresidency.[399] On one side of the court stands the Swerga Vilasam, or\r\nCelestial Pavilion, formerly the throne-room of the palace, now used by\r\nthe High Court of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 213. Hall in Palace, Mádura. (From Daniell’s ‘Views in\r\nHindostan.’)]\r\n\r\nJustice. It is an arcaded octagon, covered by a dome 60 ft. in diameter\r\nand 60 ft. in height. On another side of this court is placed the\r\nsplendid hall shown in the annexed woodcut (No. 213), the two\r\ncorresponding with the Dewanni Khas and Dewanni Aum of Mahomedan\r\npalaces. This one, in its glory, must have been as fine as any, barring\r\nthe material. The hall itself is said to be 120 ft. long by 67 ft.\r\nwide,[400] and its height to the centre of the roof is 70 ft.; but, what\r\nis more important than its dimensions, it possesses all the structural\r\npropriety and character of a Gothic building. It is evident that if the\r\nHindus had persevered a little longer in this direction they might have\r\naccomplished something that would have surpassed the works of their\r\nmasters in this form of art. In the meanwhile it is curious to observe\r\nthat the same king who built the choultries (Woodcuts Nos. 202, 203 and\r\n204) built also this hall. The style of the one is as different from\r\nthat of the other as Classic Italian from Mediæval Gothic: the one as\r\nmuch over ornamented as the other is too plain for the purposes of a\r\npalace, but both among the best things of their class which have been\r\nbuilt in the country where they are found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 214. Court in Palace, Tanjore. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe modern dynasty of Tanjore was founded by Eccoji, a brother of\r\nSivagi, the great Máhratta chief, during the decline of the Mádura\r\ndynasty in 1675. The palace was probably commenced shortly afterwards,\r\nbut the greater part of its buildings belong to the 18th century, and\r\nsome extend even into the 19th.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlike the Mádura palace in arrangement--is, indeed, evidently\r\ncopied from it--nor very different in style; but the ornamentation is\r\ncoarser and in more vulgar taste, as might be expected from our\r\nknowledge of the people who erected it (Woodcut No. 214). In some of the\r\napartments this is carried so far as to become almost offensive. One of\r\nthe most striking peculiarities of the palace is the roof of the great\r\nhall externally. As you approach Tanjore, you see two great vimanas, not\r\nunlike each other in dimensions or outline, and at a distance can hardly\r\ndistinguish which belongs to the great temple. On closer inspection,\r\nhowever, that of the palace turns out to be made up of dumpy pilasters\r\nand fat balusters, and ill-designed mouldings of Italian architecture,\r\nmixed up with a few details of Indian art! A more curious and tasteless\r\njumble can hardly be found in Calcutta or Lucknow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 215. Garden Pavilion at Vijayanagar. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe palace buildings at Vijayanagar are much more detached and scattered\r\nthan those either at Tanjore or Mádura, but they are older, and probably\r\nreproduce more nearly the arrangements of a Hindu prince’s residence,\r\nbefore they fell completely under the sway of Moslem influence.\r\nPractically the palace consists of a number of detached pavilions,\r\nbaths, hareems, and other buildings, that may have been joined by wooden\r\narcades. They certainly were situated in gardens, and may consequently\r\nhave had a unity we miss in their present state of desolation. One of\r\nthese pavilions is represented in the preceding woodcut (No. 215). It is\r\na fair specimen of that picturesque mixed style which arose from the\r\nmixture of the Saracenic and Hindu styles.\r\n\r\nEven this mixed style, however, died out wherever the Europeans settled,\r\nor their influence extended. The modern palaces of the Nawabs of the\r\nCarnatic, of the Rajas of Ramnad or Travancore, are all in the bastard\r\nItalian style, adopted by the Nawabs of Lucknow and the Babus of\r\nCalcutta. Sometimes, it must be confessed, the buildings are imposing\r\nfrom their mass, and picturesque from their variety of outline, but the\r\ndetails are always detestable, first from being bad copies of a style\r\nthat was not understood or appreciated, but also generally from their\r\nbeing unsuited for the use to which they were applied. To these defects\r\nit must be added, that the whole style is generally characterised by a\r\nvulgarity it is difficult to understand in a people who have generally\r\nshown themselves capable of so much refinement in former times.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the north of India matters have not sunk so low as in\r\nthe Madras Presidency, but in the south civil architecture as a fine art\r\nis quite extinct, and though sacred architecture still survives in a\r\ncertain queer, quaint form of temple-building, it is of so low a type\r\nthat it would hardly be a matter of regret if it, too, ceased to exist,\r\nand the curtain dropped over the graves of both, as they are arts that\r\npractically have become extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nCHALUKYAN STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nTemple at Buchropully--Kirti Stambha at Worangul--Temples at Somnathpûr\r\nand Baillûr--The Kait Iswara at Hullabîd--Temple at Hullabîd.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three styles into which Hindu architecture naturally divides\r\nitself, the Chalukyan is neither the least extensive nor the least\r\nbeautiful, but it certainly is the least known. The very name of the\r\npeople was hardly recognised by early writers on Indian subjects, and\r\nthe first clear ideas regarding them were put forward, in 1826, in a\r\npaper by Sir Walter Elliot, in the fourth volume of the ‘Journal of the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society.’ To this he added another paper, in the twentieth\r\nvolume of the ‘Madras Journal:’ and since then numerous inscriptions of\r\nthis dynasty and of its allied families have been found, and translated\r\nby General Le Grand, Jacob and others, in the ‘Bombay Journal,’ and by\r\nProfessor Dowson in the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society’\r\nhere.[401]\r\n\r\nFrom all this we gather that early in the sixth century of our era[402]\r\nthis family rose into importance at Kalyan--in what is now the Nizam’s\r\nterritory--and spread eastward as far as the shores of the Bay of\r\nBengal, in the neighbourhood of the mouths of the Kistnah and Godavery.\r\nThey extended, in fact, from shore to shore, right across the peninsula,\r\nand occupied a considerable portion of the country now known as Mysore,\r\nand northward extended as far, at least, as Dowlutabad.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, they seem to have been closely allied with the Ballabhi\r\ndynasty of Gujerat, and afterwards to be the parent stems from which the\r\nHoisala Bellalas of Dwarasamudra took their rise.\r\n\r\nTheir affiliations and descents are more easily traced than their\r\norigin. Jaya Singa, the founder of the Kalyan dynasty (A.D. 500?),\r\nclaims to be of the Solar race of Rajputs, and descended from kings\r\nreigning in Ayodhya 1000 years (fifty-nine generations) before his time.\r\nThis, however, seems as likely to be a reminiscence of the origin of\r\ntheir religion as of their race; for, though we are not yet in a\r\nposition to prove it, it seems likely that the Chalukyas were originally\r\nJains. At all events, it seems clear that the extension of the Jaina\r\nreligion is nearly conterminous with that of Chalukyan sway, and the\r\ntime at which the religion spread over India was also coincident with\r\ntheir rise and fall.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be too much to assert that the Chalukyas were\r\neither the revivors of the Jaina faith or even its principal\r\npropagators; but, during the early part of their history, this form of\r\nfaith is inextricably mixed up with the more orthodox religions as\r\npractised by them, and prevails to the present day, in the countries\r\nwhere they ruled. The style of architecture which they invented when\r\nJains was, it is true, practised afterwards by them both as Vaishnavas\r\nand Saivas; but it seems to have had its origin in the earlier form of\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nLike all dynasties of Central and Northern India, the Chalukyas suffered\r\neclipse in the dark ages that intervened between A.D. 750 and 950;[403]\r\nand the difficulty is to know whether we have any temples in their style\r\nbefore that period. Those at Aiwulli and Purudkul described above\r\n(Woodcuts Nos. 121 and 189), belong to their age, and may have been\r\nerected by early kings of this race; but they do not belong to their\r\nstyle. Their sikras, or towers, either show the curvilinear outline of\r\nthe northern style, or the storeyed pyramids of the Dravidians. It is as\r\nif this intrusive race adopted hesitatingly the styles of earlier\r\ninhabitants of the country, but that it was not till they had\r\nconsolidated their power, and developed peculiar institutions of their\r\nown, that they expressed them in the style to which their name has been\r\naffixed.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that the materials exist for settling these and\r\nall other questions connected with this style; but, unfortunately, if it\r\nis so, they exist in the Nizam’s territory, and that is _terra\r\nincognita_ to us in so far as architecture is concerned. No one has yet\r\npassed through it who had any knowledge of the art, or was even aware\r\nthat any interest attached to the forms or age of the buildings. It thus\r\nhappens that, but for a few stray photographs, it must have been passed\r\nover as a style less known, from an artistic point of view, than that of\r\nalmost any civilized country in the world. The rulers of the Hydrabad\r\nterritory being bigoted Mahomedans, it is to be feared that great\r\ndestruction of native temples may have taken place; but the real cause\r\nof our ignorance on the subject is the indifference and apathy to such\r\nmatters in those who rule the rulers, and who, if they chose, could\r\nclear up the whole mystery in a few months or years, and with little\r\nexpense to themselves, beyond expressing a wish that it should be done.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that the remains have perished. The line of\r\nMahomedan capitals--Bijapur, Kalburgah, Bidar, and Hydrabad--which have\r\nlong occupied the native country of the Chalukyas, is painfully\r\nsuggestive of the destruction of Hindu temples; but still the wealth of\r\nremains that exists in Dharwar on the south and west, and the Berars on\r\nthe north of the Nizam’s territories, is so great that all certainly\r\ncannot have perished, and many will probably be found to solve the\r\nhistorical enigmas, though they may not be sufficient to restore the\r\nstyle in its integrity.\r\n\r\nWhether Kalyani itself has escaped is by no means clear. In a list of\r\nremains in the Bombay Presidency, prepared by Mr. Burgess, dated 1873,\r\nthere are the following entries:--“Three miles to the south-east of\r\ntown, some fine temples and other ruins;” and further on, on the\r\nauthority of the late Bhau Daji, it is stated, “has extensive ruins for\r\nmiles around. There are caves in the hills, called Hazar Khotri, or\r\nThousand Chambers. Pir Padshah Musjid is probably part of a Hindu\r\ntemple.” If this is so, the history of the style is probably all there,\r\nand only awaits the advent of some one capable of reading it.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and most typical example of the style that I know, and the\r\none, consequently, which will serve best to explain its peculiarities,\r\nis at a place called Buchropully, not far from Hydrabad. It probably is\r\nalso one of the oldest, and may even date before the cataclysm; but this\r\nis only a guess. I have no such real knowledge of the early form of the\r\nstyle as would enable me to feel sure on such a subject. As will be\r\nobserved, the temple itself is polygonal, or star-shaped, of twenty-four\r\nsides (Woodcut No. 216). These, however, are not obtained, as in the\r\nnorthern style, by increments added flatly to a square, as will be\r\nexplained hereafter, but are points touching a circle, in this instance\r\napparently right angles, but afterwards were either more acute or\r\nflatter than a right angle. There are four principal faces, however,\r\nlarger than the others: three occupied by niches, the fourth by the\r\nentrance. The roof is in steps, and with a flat band on each face in\r\ncontinuation of the larger face below. The summit ornament is a flower\r\nor vase, in this instance apparently incomplete. The porch is simple,\r\nconsisting only of sixteen pillars, disposed equidistantly, without any\r\nattempt at the octagonal dome of the Jains or the varied arrangements\r\nsubsequently attempted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 216. Temple at Buchropully. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough of no great magnificence in itself, this temple is interesting\r\nas possessing all the features which distinguish the Chalukyan style\r\nfrom those that surround it either on the north or south. Instead of\r\ntheir square plans, this one is practically star-shaped. The sikra is a\r\nstraight-lined cone, and its decorations in steps is as unlike the\r\nDravidian spire in storeys as it is to the curvilinear outline of the\r\nJaina or northern temples. The porch, too, is open, and consists of\r\ncolumns spaced equidistantly over its floor, without either the\r\nbracketing arrangements of the southern or the domical forms of the\r\nnorthern styles. Situated as it was locally, half-way between the\r\nDravidian and northern styles, the Chalukyan borrowed occasionally a\r\nfeature or form from one or from the other, but never to such an extent\r\nas to obliterate its individuality, or to prevent its being recognised\r\nas a separate and distinct style of architecture.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nizam’s territory is examined, we shall probably be able to\r\ntrace all the steps by which this simple village example developed into\r\nthe metropolitan temple of Hammoncondah, the old capital, six miles\r\nnorth of Worangul. According to an inscription on its walls, this temple\r\nwas erected, in A.D. 1163, by Pratapa Rudra,[404]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 217. Doorway of Great Temple at Hammoncondah. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nwho, though not exactly himself a Chalukya in blood, succeeded to their\r\npossessions and their style. The temple itself is triple, having three\r\ndetached cells of very considerable dimensions, in front of which is a\r\nportico, supported by between 240 or 300 pillars, disposed in a varied\r\nand complicated pattern,[405] but without any sign, so far as I can\r\ntrace, of the Jaina octagonal arrangement for a dome. Like most of these\r\nlate temples, this one was never finished. It was too extensive for one\r\nking’s reign, even for one so powerful as he was who undertook it, and\r\nbefore it was heartily taken up again the Mahomedans were upon them (in\r\nA.D. 1309), and there was an end of Hindu greatness and of Hindu art.\r\n\r\nSome of its details, however, are of great beauty, especially the\r\nentrances, which are objects on which the architects generally lavished\r\ntheir utmost skill. The preceding woodcut (No. 217) will explain the\r\nform of those of the great temple, as well as the general ordinances of\r\nthe pillars of the great portico. Nothing in Hindu art is more pleasing\r\nthan the pierced slabs which the Chalukyas used for windows. They are\r\nnot, so far as I recollect, used--certainly, not extensively--in any\r\nother style, but as used by them are highly ornamental and appropriate,\r\nboth externally and internally.\r\n\r\nThe pillars, too, are rich, without being overdone; and as it is only in\r\npairs that they are of the same design, the effect of the whole is\r\nsingularly varied, but at the same time pleasing and elegant.\r\n\r\nThere are at Hammoncondah or Worangul a great number of smaller temples\r\nand shrines, in the same style as the great temple, and, like it,\r\napparently all dedicated to Siva, from the constant presence of his bull\r\neverywhere. Most are ruined; but whether this is owing to Moslem bigotry\r\nor faulty construction, it is difficult to say. Judging from\r\nappearances, I am inclined to believe the latter was the true cause. The\r\nmode of building is without mortar, and the joints are by no means well\r\nfitted. The style is also remarkably free from figure-sculpture, which\r\nis generally the thing that most easily excites the iconoclastic\r\nfeelings of the followers of the Prophet.\r\n\r\nIn Worangul there are four Kirti Stambhas, as they are called, facing\r\none another, as if they formed the entrances to a square enclosure\r\n(Woodcut No. 218). No wall is there, however, nor is there anything\r\ninside; so the object of their erection is by no means apparent. They\r\nwere set up by the same Pratapa Rudra who built the great temple in the\r\nold capital, and built several others in this new city. It cannot be\r\nsaid they are particularly elegant specimens of art. Their main interest\r\nlies in their being the lineal descendants of the four gateways at\r\nSanchi (Woodcut No. 33), and they may have been erected to replace some\r\nwooden or frailer structure which had fallen into decay. Whether this is\r\nso or not, they are curious as exemplifying how, in the course of a\r\nthousand years or thereabouts, a wooden style of building may lose all\r\ntraces of its origin and become as essentially lithic as these, but\r\nstill betray its origin as clearly as they do; for it seems most\r\nunlikely that any such form could have been invented by any one using\r\nstone constructions, and that only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 218. Kirti Stambha at Worangul. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSORE.\r\n\r\nIt is in the province of Mysore, however, that the Chalukyan style\r\nattained its fullest development and highest degree of perfection during\r\nthe three centuries--A.D. 1000 to 1300--in which the Hoisala Bellalas\r\nhad supreme sway in that country. Three temples, or rather groups of\r\ntemples, were erected by them--the first at a place called Somnathpûr,\r\nsouth of Mysore, by Vinaditya Bellala, who ascended the throne A.D.\r\n1043; the second at Baillûr, in the centre of the province, owed its\r\norigin apparently to Vishnu Verddhana, in or about A.D. 1114; the last\r\nand greatest at a place they called Dwarsamudra--the Gate of the\r\nSea--now known as Hullabîd, not far from the last-named, from which the\r\ncapital was removed by Vijaya Narsinha, in 1145. It continued to be the\r\nmetropolis of the kingdom, till it was destroyed and the building of\r\nthe great temple stopped by the Mahomedan invasion in A.D.\r\n1310-1311.[406]\r\n\r\nEven in this short series we see evidence of that downward progress of\r\nart, especially in sculpture, which is everywhere the characteristic of\r\nHindu art. Though the design is the grandest, the sculpture and details\r\nof Hullabîd are inferior to those of Baillûr, and Somnathpûr seems\r\nsuperior to both. We consequently long to trace back the history of the\r\nstyle to some more distant date, when we might find it emerging in\r\npurity and elegance from some unknown prototype. Unfortunately, we are\r\nnot at present able to do this. We are obliged to leap over the dark\r\nages to the caves and temples of Badami and Aiwulli, and have no\r\nintermediate examples to connect the two. It is more than probable that\r\nthey do exist, and will be found when looked for. Meanwhile, however, we\r\ncan only assume that the star-like plans and peculiar details of the\r\nstyle were elaborated between the 6th and the 10th centuries in Central\r\nand Western India, but where and by whom remains still to be discovered.\r\n\r\nLike the great temple at Hammoncondah, that at Somnathpûr is triple, the\r\ncells, with their sikras, being attached to a square pillared hall, to\r\nthe fourth side of which a portico is attached, in this instance of very\r\nmoderate dimensions.[407] The whole stands in a square cloistered court,\r\nand has the usual accompaniments of entrance-porches, stambhas, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following illustration (No. 219) will give an idea--an imperfect\r\none, it must be confessed--of the elegance of outline and marvellous\r\nelaboration of detail that characterises these shrines. Judging from the\r\nfigure of a man in one of the photographs, its height seems to be only\r\nabout 30 ft., which, if it stood in the open, would be almost too small\r\nfor architectural effect; but in the centre of an enclosed court, and\r\nwhere there are no larger objects to contrast with it, it is sufficient,\r\nwhen judiciously treated, to produce a considerable impression of\r\ngrandeur, and apparently does so in this instance.\r\n\r\nThe temple at Somnathpûr is a single but complete whole; that at\r\nBaillûr, on the other hand, consists of one principal temple, surrounded\r\nby four or five others and numerous subordinate buildings, enclosed in a\r\ncourt by a high wall measuring 360 ft. by 440 ft., and having two very\r\nfine gateways or gopuras in its eastern front. As will be seen from the\r\nfollowing plan (Woodcut No. 220), the great temple consists of a very\r\nsolid vimana, with an anterala, or porch; and in front of this a porch\r\nof the usual star-like form, measuring 90 ft. across. The whole length\r\nof the temple, from the east door to the back of cell, is 115 ft., and\r\nthe whole stands on a terrace about 3 ft. high, and from 10 ft. to 15\r\nft. wide. This is one of the characteristic features of Chalukyan\r\ndesign, and adds very considerably to the effect of their temples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 219. Temple at Somnathpûr. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the pillars have much of that pleasing\r\nsubordination and variety of spacing which is found in those of the\r\nJains, but we miss here the octagonal dome, which gives such poetry and\r\nmeaning to the arrangements they adopted. Instead of that, we have only\r\nan exaggerated compartment in the centre, which fits nothing, and,\r\nthough it does give dignity to the centre, it does it so clumsily as to\r\nbe almost offensive in an architectural sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 220. Plan of Great Temple at Baillûr. Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, either to its dimensions, or the disposition of its\r\nplan, that this temple owes its pre-eminence among others of its class,\r\nbut to the marvellous elaboration and beauty of its details. The effect\r\nof these, it is true, has been, in modern times, considerably marred by\r\nthe repeated coats of whitewash which the present low order of priests\r\nconsider the most appropriate way of adding to the beauty of the most\r\ndelicate sculptures. Notwithstanding this, however, their outline can\r\nalways be traced, and where the whitewash has not been applied, or has\r\nbeen worn off, their beauty comes out with wonderful sharpness.\r\n\r\nThe following woodcut (No. 221) will convey some idea of the richness\r\nand variety of pattern displayed in the windows of the porch. These are\r\ntwenty-eight in number, and all are different. Some are pierced with\r\nmerely conventional patterns, generally star-shaped, and with foliaged\r\nbands between; others are interspersed with figures and mythological\r\nsubjects--the nearest one, for instance, on the left, in the woodcut,\r\nrepresents the Varaha Avatar, and others different scenes connected\r\nwith the worship of Vishnu, to whom the temple is dedicated. The pierced\r\nslabs themselves, however, are hardly so remarkable as the richly-carved\r\nbase on which they rest, and the deep cornice which overshadows and\r\nprotects them. The amount of labour, indeed, which each facet of this\r\nporch displays is such as, I believe, never was bestowed on any surface\r\nof equal extent in any building in the world; and though the design is\r\nnot of the highest order of art, it is elegant and appropriate, and\r\nnever offends against good taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 221. View of part of Porch at Baillûr. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe sculptures of the base of the vimana, which have not been\r\nwhitewashed, are as elaborate as those of the porch, in some places more\r\nso; and the mode in which the undersides of the cornices have been\r\nelaborated and adorned is such as is only to be found in temples of this\r\nclass. The upper part of the tower is anomalous. It may be that it has\r\nbeen whitewashed and repaired till it has assumed its present discordant\r\nappearance, which renders it certainly a blot on the whole design. My\r\nown impression rather is, that, like many others of its class, it was\r\nleft unfinished, and the upper part added at subsequent periods. Its\r\noriginal form most probably was that of the little pavilions that adorn\r\nits portals, one of which is represented in the following woodcut (No.\r\n222), which has all the peculiar features of the style--the flat band on\r\neach face, the three star-like projections between, and the peculiar\r\ncrowning ornament of the style. The plan of the great tower, and the\r\npresence of the pavilions where they stand, seems to prove almost beyond\r\ndoubt that this was the original design; but the design may have been\r\naltered as it progressed, or it may, as I suspect, have been changed\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be little or no doubt about the date of this temple. It\r\nwas erected by Vishnu Verddhana, the fourth king of the race, to\r\ncommemorate his conversion by the celebrated Rama Anuja from the Jaina\r\nto the Hindu faith. He ascended the throne A.D. 1114, and his conversion\r\ntook place soon afterwards; but it is possible he did not live to finish\r\nthe temple, and as the capital was removed by the next king to Hullabîd,\r\nit is possible that the vimana of the great temple, and the erection of\r\nsome at least of the smaller shrines, may belong to a subsequent period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 222. Pavilion at Baillûr. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHULLABÎD.\r\n\r\nThe earliest temple known to exist at Hullabîd is a small detached\r\nshrine, known by the inexplicable name of Kait Iswara, dedicated to\r\nSiva, and probably erected by Vijaya, the fifth king of the Bellala\r\ndynasty. Its general appearance will be understood from the next woodcut\r\n(No. 223). It is star-shaped in plan, with sixteen points, and had a\r\nporch, now so entirely ruined and covered up with vegetation that it is\r\ndifficult to make out its plan. Its roof is conical, and from the\r\nbasement to the summit it is covered with sculptures of the very best\r\nclass of Indian art, and these so arranged as not materially to\r\ninterfere with the outlines of the building, while they impart to it an\r\namount of richness only to be found among specimens of Hindu art.[408]\r\nIf it were possible to illustrate this little temple in anything like\r\ncompleteness, there is probably nothing in India which would convey a\r\nbetter idea of what its architects were capable of accomplishing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 223. Kait Iswara, Hullabîd. (From a Photograph by Capt.\r\nTripe.)]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, surpassed in size and magnificence by its neighbour, the\r\ngreat temple at Hullabîd, which, had it been completed, is one of the\r\nbuildings on which the advocate of Hindu architecture would desire to\r\ntake his stand. Unfortunately, it never was finished, the works having\r\nbeen stopped by the Mahomedan conquest in 1310 A.D., after they had been\r\nin progress apparently for eighty-six years. It is instructive to\r\nobserve that the single century that elapsed between the execution of\r\nthe sculpture of the Kait Iswara and of this temple, was sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate the decay in style which we have already noticed as an\r\ninherent characteristic of Indian art. The sculptures of Hullabîd are\r\ninferior to those of the Kait Iswara, and those of that temple, again,\r\nto those at Baillûr.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 224. Plan of Temple at Hullabîd. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe general arrangements of the building are given on the annexed plan\r\n(Woodcut No. 224), from which it will be perceived that it is a double\r\ntemple. If it were cut into halves, each part would be complete with a\r\npillared porch of the same type as that at Baillûr, above referred to,\r\nan anterala or intermediate porch, and a sanctuary containing a lingam,\r\nthe emblem of Siva. Besides this, each half would have in front of it a\r\ndetached, pillared porch as a shrine for the Bull Nundi, which, of\r\ncourse, was not required in a Vaishnava temple. Such double temples are\r\nby no means uncommon in India, but the two sanctuaries usually face each\r\nother, and have the porch between them. Its dimensions may roughly be\r\nstated as 200 ft. square over all, including all the detached pavilions.\r\nThe temple itself is 160 ft. north and south, by 122 ft. east and west.\r\nIts height, as it now remains, to the cornice is about 25 ft. from the\r\nterrace on which it stands. It cannot, therefore, be considered by any\r\nmeans as a large building, though large enough for effect. This,\r\nhowever, can hardly be judged of as it now stands, for there is no doubt\r\nbut that it was intended to raise two pyramidal spires over the\r\nsanctuaries, four smaller ones in front of these, and two more, one over\r\neach of the two central pavilions. Thus completed, the temple would have\r\nassumed something like the outline shown in the woodcut (No. 225), and\r\nif carried out with the richness of detail exhibited in the Kait Iswara\r\n(Woodcut No. 223) would have made up a whole which it would be difficult\r\nto rival anywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 225. Restored View of Temple at Hullabîd.]\r\n\r\nThe material out of which this temple is erected is an indurated\r\npotstone, of volcanic origin, found in the neighbourhood. This stone is\r\nsaid to be soft when first quarried, and easily cut in that state,\r\nthough hardening on exposure to the atmosphere. Even this, however, will\r\nnot diminish our admiration of the amount of labour bestowed on the\r\ntemple, for, from the number of parts still unfinished, it is evident\r\nthat, like most others of its class, it was built in block, and carved\r\nlong after the stone had become hard. As we now see it, the stone is of\r\na pleasing creamy colour, and so close-grained as to take a polish like\r\nmarble. The pillars of the great Nundi pavilion, which look as if they\r\nhad been turned in a lathe, are so polished as to exhibit what the\r\nnatives call a double reflection--in other words, to reflect light from\r\neach other. The enduring qualities of the stone seem to be unrivalled,\r\nfor, though neglected and exposed to all the vicissitudes of a tropical\r\nclimate for more than six centuries, the minutest details are as clear\r\nand sharp as the day they were finished. Except from the splitting of\r\nthe stone arising from bad masonry, the building is as perfect as when\r\nits erection was stopped by the Mahomedan conquest.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to illustrate completely so complicated and\r\nso varied a design; but the following woodcut (No. 226) will suffice to\r\nexplain the general ordonnance of its elevation. The building stands on\r\na terrace ranging from 5 ft. to 6 ft. in height, and paved with large\r\nslabs. On this stands a frieze of elephants, following all the\r\nsinuosities of the plan and extending to some 710 ft. in length, and\r\ncontaining not less than 2000 elephants, most of them with riders and\r\ntrappings, sculptured as only an Oriental can represent the wisest of\r\nbrutes. Above these is a frieze of “shardalas,” or conventional\r\nlions--the emblems of the Hoisala Bellalas who built the temple. Then\r\ncomes a scroll of infinite beauty and variety of design; over this a\r\nfrieze of horsemen and another scroll; over which is a bas-relief of\r\nscenes from the ‘Ramayana,’ representing the conquest of Ceylon and all\r\nthe varied incidents of that epic. This, like the other, is about 700\r\nft. long. (The frieze of the Parthenon is less than 550 ft.) Then come\r\ncelestial beasts and celestial birds, and all along the east front a\r\nfrieze of groups from human life, and then a cornice, with a rail,\r\ndivided into panels, each containing two figures. Over this are windows\r\nof pierced slabs, like those of Baillûr, though not so rich or varied.\r\nThese windows will be observed on the right and left of the woodcut. In\r\nthe centre, in place of the windows, is first a scroll, and then a\r\nfrieze of gods and heavenly apsaras--dancing girls and other objects of\r\nHindu mythology. This frieze, which is about 5 ft. 6 in. in height, is\r\ncontinued all round the western front of the building, and extends to\r\nsome 400 ft. in length. Siva, with his consort Parvati seated on his\r\nknee, is repeated at least fourteen times; Vishnu in his nine Avatars\r\neven oftener. Brahma occurs three or four times, and every great god of\r\nthe Hindu Pantheon finds his place. Some of these are carved with a\r\nminute elaboration of detail which can only be reproduced by\r\nphotography, and may probably be considered as one of the most\r\nmarvellous exhibitions of human labour to be found even in the patient\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be considered that it is only for patient industry\r\nthat this building is remarkable. The mode in which the eastern face is\r\nbroken up by the larger masses, so as to give height and play of light\r\nand shade, is a better way of accomplishing what the Gothic architects\r\nattempted by their transepts and projections. This, however, is\r\nsurpassed by the western front, where the variety of outline, and the\r\narrangement and subordination of the various facets in which it is\r\ndisposed, must be considered as a masterpiece of design in its class. If\r\nthe frieze of gods were spread along a plain surface it\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 226. Central Pavilion, Hullabîd, East Front. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nwould lose more than half its effect, while the vertical angles, without\r\ninterfering with the continuity of the frieze, give height and strength\r\nto the whole composition. The disposition of the horizontal lines of the\r\nlower friezes is equally effective. Here again the artistic combination\r\nof horizontal with vertical lines, and the play of outline and of light\r\nand shade, far surpass anything in Gothic art. The effects are just what\r\nthe mediæval architects were often aiming at, but which they never\r\nattained so perfectly as was done at Hullabîd.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Hullabîd, it may be well again to call attention to the\r\norder of superposition of the different animal friezes, alluded to\r\nalready, when speaking of the rock-cut monastery described by the\r\nChinese Pilgrims (_ante_, p. 135). There, as here, the lowest were the\r\nelephants; then the lions; above these came the horses; then the oxen;\r\nand the fifth storey was in the shape of a pigeon. The oxen here is\r\nreplaced by a conventional animal, and the pigeon also by a bird of a\r\nspecies that would puzzle a naturalist. The succession, however, is the\r\nsame, and, as mentioned above, the same five genera of living things\r\nform the ornaments of the moonstones of the various monuments in Ceylon.\r\nSometimes in modern Hindu temples only two or three animal friezes are\r\nfound, but the succession is always the same, the elephants being the\r\nlowest, next above them are the lions, and then the horses, &c. When we\r\nknow the cause of it, it seems as if this curious selection and\r\nsuccession might lead to some very suggestive conclusions. At present we\r\ncan only call attention to it in hopes that further investigation may\r\nafford the means of solving the mystery.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to illustrate the Hullabîd temple to such an extent\r\nas to render its peculiarities familiar, there would be few things more\r\ninteresting or more instructive than to institute a comparison between\r\nit and the Parthenon at Athens. Not that the two buildings are at all\r\nlike one another; on the contrary, they form the two opposite poles--the\r\nalpha and omega of architectural design; but they are the best examples\r\nof their class, and between these two extremes lies the whole range of\r\nthe art. The Parthenon is the best example we know of pure refined\r\nintellectual power applied to the production of an architectural design.\r\nEvery part and every effect is calculated with mathematical exactness,\r\nand executed with a mechanical precision that never was equalled. All\r\nthe curves are hyperbolas, parabolas, or other developments of the\r\nhighest mathematical forms--every optical defect is foreseen and\r\nprovided for, and every part has a relation to every other part in so\r\nrecondite a proportion that we feel inclined to call it fanciful,\r\nbecause we can hardly rise to its appreciation. The sculpture is\r\nexquisitely designed to aid the perfection of the masonry--severe and\r\ngodlike, but with no condescension to the lower feelings of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Hullabîd temple is the opposite of all this. It is regular, but with\r\na studied variety of outline in plan, and even greater variety in\r\ndetail. All the pillars of the Parthenon are identical, while no two\r\nfacets of the Indian temple are the same; every convolution of every\r\nscroll is different. No two canopies in the whole building are alike,\r\nand every part exhibits a joyous exuberance of fancy scorning every\r\nmechanical restraint. All that is wild in human faith or warm in human\r\nfeeling is found portrayed on these walls; but of pure intellect there\r\nis little--less than there is of human feeling in the Parthenon.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to arrange all the buildings of the world between\r\nthese two extremes, as they tended toward the severe intellectual purity\r\nof the one, or to the playful exuberant fancy of the other; but\r\nperfection, if it existed, would be somewhere near the mean. My own\r\nimpression is, that if the so-called Gothic architects had been able to\r\nmaintain for two or three hundred years more the rate of progress they\r\nachieved between the 11th and the 14th century, they might have hit upon\r\nthat happy mean between severe constructive propriety and playful\r\ndecorative imaginings which would have combined into something more\r\nperfect than the world has yet seen. The system, however, as I have\r\nendeavoured to point out elsewhere, broke down before it had acquired\r\nthe requisite degree of refinement, and that hope was blighted never to\r\nbe revived. If architecture ever again assumes an onward path, it will\r\nnot be by leaning too strongly towards either of the extremes just\r\nnamed, but by grasping somewhere the happy mean between the two.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose, the great value of the study of these Indian\r\nexamples is that it widens so immensely our basis for architectural\r\ncriticism. It is only by becoming familiar with forms so utterly\r\ndissimilar from those we have hitherto been conversant with, that we\r\nperceive how narrow is the purview that is content with one form or one\r\npassing fashion. By rising to this wider range we shall perceive that\r\narchitecture is as many-sided as human nature itself, and learn how few\r\nfeelings and how few aspirations of the human heart and brain there are\r\nthat cannot be expressed by its means. On the other hand, it is only by\r\ntaking this wide survey that we appreciate how worthless any product of\r\narchitectural art becomes which does not honestly represent the thoughts\r\nand feelings of those who built it, or the height of their loftiest\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return, however, from this digression. There are some eight or nine\r\ndifferent temples in this style illustrated by photographs in the great\r\nwork on the ‘Architecture of Dharwar and Mysore,’[409] which exhibit the\r\npeculiarities of this style in more or less detail; but none of these\r\nplates are accompanied by plans or details that throw new light on the\r\nsubject, and none of the temples are either so large or so beautiful as\r\nthose just described, so that the enumeration of their unfamiliar names\r\nwould add very little to the interest of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting, however, if we could adduce some northern\r\nexamples of the style from either the capital city of the Ballabhis, or\r\nsome town in their kingdom. For about two centuries--A.D. 500 to\r\n700--they were a leading power in India, and closely allied to the\r\nChalukyas; and their style, if any examples could be found, would throw\r\ngreat light on that of their southern allies just at the period when it\r\nis most wanted. Unfortunately, however, even the site of their capital\r\nis unknown. If it were at Wulleh, near Gogo, on the shores of the Gulf\r\nof Cambay, as is generally supposed, it has perished root and branch.\r\nNot one vestige of its architecture now remains, and what antiquities\r\nhave been found seem all to belong to a much more modern period, when a\r\ncity bearing that name may have existed on the spot. If it were situated\r\nnear Anhulwarra Puttun, which seems far more probable, it has been\r\nquarried to supply materials for the successive capitals which from that\r\ntime forward have occupied that favoured neighbourhood, and it would\r\nrequire the keen eye of a practised archæologist to detect Chalukyan\r\ndetails in the temples and mosques that have been erected there during\r\nthe last 800 years. Nothing of the sort has yet been attempted, and no\r\nmaterials consequently exist for the elucidation of one of the most\r\ninteresting chapters in the history of Indian art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN OR INDO-ARYAN STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nIntroductory--Dravidian and Indo-Aryan Temples at Badami--Modern Temple\r\nat Benares.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three styles into which Hindu architecture naturally divides\r\nitself, the northern is found spread over a far larger portion of the\r\ncountry than either of the other two. It wants, however, the compactness\r\nand strongly-marked individuality of the Dravidian, and never was\r\ndeveloped with that exuberance which characterised the southern style\r\nfrom the 15th to the 18th century. In many respects it resembles more\r\nthe Chalukyan style, the examples being small and elegant, and found\r\ndispersed over the face of the country, where wanted, without any\r\napparent massing together in particular spots.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have no name which would describe the style in its\r\nethnographical and geographical relations without being open to the\r\nobjection of expressing either too much or too little. In this respect\r\nthe southern style is singularly fortunate: Dravidian correctly limits\r\nit to people speaking Tamil, Telugu, or some cognate dialect; and the\r\ncountry where the people speaking those tongues are to be found is\r\ngenerally and correctly known as Dravida Desa, or country of the\r\nDravidians.\r\n\r\nThe term Chalukyan, applied to the second style, is not so expressive;\r\nbut it is unobjectionable, as it cannot mislead any one. It is only a\r\nconventional term, derived from the principal known dynasty ruling in\r\nthat country, applied to a style occupying a borderland between the\r\nother two, but a land that has not yet been fully surveyed, and whose\r\nboundaries cannot now be fixed with precision. Till they are, a\r\nconventional name that does not mislead is all that can be hoped for.\r\n\r\nIf it were allowable to adopt the loose phraseology of philological\r\nethnography, the term Aryan might be employed, as it is the name by\r\nwhich the people practising this style are usually known in India, and\r\nit would be particularly convenient here, as it is the correct and\r\ndirect antithesis of Dravidian. It is evident, however, that any such\r\nterm, if applied to architecture, ought to be descriptive of some style\r\npractised by that people, wherever they settled, all across Europe and\r\nAsia, between the shores of the Atlantic and the Bay of Bengal;[410] and\r\nit need hardly be said that no such style exists. If used in conjunction\r\nwith the adjective Indian or Indo, it becomes much less objectionable,\r\nand has the advantage of limiting its use to the people who are\r\ngenerally known as Aryans in India--in other words, to all those parts\r\nof the country where Sanscrit was ever spoken, or where the people now\r\nspeak tongues so far derived from Sanscrit as to be distinguishable as\r\noffsets of that great family of languages. Its use, in this respect, has\r\nthe great convenience that any ordinary ethnographical or linguistic map\r\nof India is sufficient to describe the boundaries of the style. It\r\nextends, like the so-called Aryan tongues, from the Himalayas to the\r\nVindhya mountains. On the east, it is found prevalent in Orissa; and on\r\nthe west in Maharastra. Its southern boundary between these two\r\nprovinces will only be known when the Nizam’s territory is\r\narchitecturally surveyed; but meanwhile we may rest assured that\r\nwherever it is traced the linguistic and architectural boundary-lines\r\nwill be found coincident.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the term Aryan should be applied to the style is,\r\nthat the country just described, where it prevails, is, and always has\r\nbeen, called Aryavarta by the natives themselves. They consider it as\r\nthe land of the pure and just--meaning thereby the Sanscrit-speaking\r\npeoples--as contradistinguished from that of the casteless Dasyus, and\r\nother tribes, who, though they may have adopted Brahmanical\r\ninstitutions, could not acquire their purity of race.\r\n\r\nThe great defect of the term, however, is that the people inhabiting the\r\nnorth of India are not Aryans in any reasonable sense of the term,\r\nwhatever philologists may say to the contrary. The Sanscrit-speaking\r\npeople, who came into India 2000 or it may be 3000 years B.C., could\r\nnever have been numerically one-half of the inhabitants of the country,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in some such limited district as that between the\r\nSutlej and the Jumna; and since the Christian Era no Aryan race has\r\nmigrated eastward across the Indus, but wave after wave of peoples of\r\nTuranian race, under the names of Yavanas, Sakas, Hunas, or Mongols,\r\nhave poured into India. This, combined with the ascendancy of the\r\naboriginal races during the period when Buddhism was the religion of the\r\ncountry, has so completely washed out Aryanism from northern India\r\nduring the building ages, that there is probably no community there\r\nwhich could claim one-tenth of pure Aryan blood in its veins, and with\r\nnine-tenths of impurity the term is certainly a misnomer. If it were\r\nnot, we would certainly find some trace of external Aryan affinities in\r\ntheir style; but this is not the case. In fact, no style is so purely\r\nlocal, and, if the term may be used, so aboriginal, as this. The origin\r\nof the Buddhist style is obvious and unmistakeable; that of the\r\nDravidian and Chalukyan nearly as certain, though not quite so obvious;\r\nbut the origin of the northern Hindu style remains a mystery, unless,\r\nindeed, the solution suggested above (_ante_, p. 224) be considered an\r\nexplanation. It may be so, to some extent; but I confess it is to my\r\nmind neither quite satisfactory nor sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe style was adopted by the Jains, who, as the successors of the\r\nBuddhists, certainly were not Aryans, and several examples of the\r\npeculiar forms of their vimanas, or sikras have already been given\r\n(Woodcuts Nos. 137, 145, &c.); but it still remains to be ascertained\r\nfrom what original form the curvilinear square tower could have arisen.\r\nThere is nothing in Buddhist, or any other art, at all like it. It does\r\nnot seem to have been derived from any wooden form we know, nor from any\r\nbrick or stone, or tile mode of roofing found anywhere else. I have\r\nlooked longer, and, perhaps, thought more, on this problem than on any\r\nother of its class connected with Indian architecture, but I have no\r\nmore plausible suggestion to offer than that hinted at above. The real\r\nsolution will probably be found in the accidental discovery of old\r\ntemples--so old as to betray in their primitive rudeness the secret we\r\nare now guessing at in vain. Meanwhile we probably may remain sure that\r\nit was not an imported form, but an indigenous production, and that it\r\nhas no connection with the architecture of any other people Aryan, or\r\nothers outside of India.\r\n\r\nThe view above proposed for the origin of the style derives considerable\r\nsupport from the mode in which the temples are now found distributed.\r\nThere are more temples now in Orissa than in all the rest of Hindustan\r\nput together. They are very frequent in Maharastra, and, if we admit the\r\nJains, who adopted this style, they are ten times more frequent in\r\nGujerat and the valley of the Nerbudda than in the valley of the Ganges,\r\nor in Aryavarta, properly so called. The first and most obvious\r\nexplanation of this fact might be that the last-named country has for\r\n600 years been occupied by a Mahomedan empire, and they, hating idolatry\r\nand idol temples, have destroyed them wherever they were so absolutely\r\nin possession of the country as to be able to do so with impunity. This\r\nmay be so, and it is an argument which, with our present materials, it\r\nis difficult to disprove. My impression, however, is that it does not\r\ncorrectly represent the true state of the case. That the Moslems did\r\nruthlessly destroy Jaina temples at Ajmir, Delhi, Canouge, and\r\nelsewhere, may be quite true, but then it was because their columns\r\nserved so admirably for the construction of their mosques. The astylar\r\ntemples of the followers of Siva or Vishnu could only have served as\r\nquarries, and no stones that had been previously used in Hindu temples\r\nhave been traced to any extent in Moslem buildings. Even admitting that\r\nat Delhi or Allahabad, or any of their capitals, all Hindu buildings\r\nhave been utilised, this hardly would have been the case at such a\r\nprovincial capital as Fyzabad, once Ayodhya, the celebrated capital of\r\nDasaratha, the father of the hero of the ‘Ramayana,’ but where not one\r\ncarved stone or even a foundation can be discovered that belongs to any\r\nancient building.[411] The most crucial instance, however, is the city\r\nof Benares, so long the sacred city, _par excellence_, of the Hindus,\r\nyet, so far as is known, no vestige of an ancient Hindu temple exists\r\nwithin its precincts. James Prinsep resided there for ten years, and\r\nMajor Kittoe, who had a keener eye than even his great master for an\r\narchitectural form, lived long there as an archæologist and architect.\r\nThey drew and measured everything, yet neither of them ever thought that\r\nthey had found anything that was ancient; and it was not till Messrs.\r\nHorne and Sherring[412] started the theory that the buildings around the\r\nBakariya Kund were ancient Buddhist or Hindu remains, that any one\r\npretended to have discovered any traces of antiquity in that city. They\r\ncertainly, however, are mistaken. Every building about the Bakariya Kund\r\nwas not only erected by the Mahomedans, but the pillars and\r\nroofing-stones, with the fewest possible exceptions, were carved by them\r\nfor the purposes for which they were applied. They may have used the\r\nstones of some deserted monasteries, or other Buddhist buildings, in the\r\nfoundations or on their terraces, or for little detached pavilions; but\r\nall the architecture, properly so called, is in a style invented, or at\r\nleast introduced by the Pathans, and brought to perfection under Akbar.\r\nThat the Moslems did destroy Hindu temples may be admitted, but it is\r\nnot clear that this was done wantonly. In all the instances which are\r\nauthenticated, it was to gain ready-made materials for their mosques,\r\nand it was not till the time of Aurungzebe that any of their monarchs\r\nfelt himself sufficiently powerful or was so bigoted as to dare the\r\npower and enmity of the Brahmans of Benares, by erecting a mosque on the\r\nsite of one of the most sacred temples as an insult and a defiance to\r\nthe Hindus. Even then, had such a temple as the great one at Bhuvaneswar\r\never existed in Benares, every stone of which, from the ground to the\r\nkullus, is covered with carving, it seems impossible that all these\r\ncarved stones should be hid away and not one now to be found. I am\r\nmyself personally tolerably familiar with Benares, and the conviction\r\nsuch knowledge as I have forces on my mind is, that though the city was\r\nthe earliest and most important settlement of the Vedic Brahmans--the\r\nsacred city of the Aryan Hindus from the remotest ages--yet just from\r\nthat cause it had fewer temples than any of the cities inhabited by less\r\npure races. What few fragments remain are Buddhist or Jaina, and we must\r\nconsequently ascribe the absence of anything really ancient more to the\r\nnon-building instincts of the Brahmanical Aryans than the iconoclastic\r\nbigotry of the Moslems.\r\n\r\nAll this will be clearer as we proceed; but meanwhile it may be well to\r\npoint to one or two other instances of this. The rock at Gualior was one\r\nof the earliest conquests of the Moslems, and they held it more or less\r\ndirectly for five centuries. They built palaces and mosques within its\r\nprecincts, yet the most conspicuous objects on the hill are Hindu\r\ntemples, that were erected before they obtained possession of it. In\r\nlike manner Chittore was thrice besieged and thrice sacked by the\r\nMahomedans, but its numerous buildings are intact, and I do not\r\nrecollect observing a single instance of wanton destruction in the\r\nplace. An even more striking instance is found at Ellora. Though\r\nAurungzebe, the most bigoted of his race, built his capital in its\r\nneighbourhood, and lies buried within sight of the caves, there is no\r\nproof that he or any of his race were the authors of any of the damage\r\nthat has been done to the idols there. Practically, they are intact, or\r\nhave only received such mutilation as is easily accounted for from other\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to attempt it, but, fortunately, it is not necessary\r\nfor our present purposes to go into the whole evidence; but I may state\r\nthat the impression I have derived from such attention as I have been\r\nable to give to the subject is, that the absence of old temples in\r\nnorthern India is more owing to ethnographic than to religious causes.\r\nIt seems more probable that they never existed than that they were\r\ndestroyed. No temples are mentioned in the Vedas or the older Indian\r\nwritings, and none were required for the simple quasi-domestic rites of\r\ntheir worship; and so long as they remained pure no temples were built.\r\nOn the other hand, it appears as if between the fall of Buddhism and the\r\nadvent of the Moslems the Jains had stepped in with a ready-made\r\nreligion and style, and the followers of Siva and Vishnu had not time to\r\ndevelope anything very important in these northern provinces before it\r\nwas too late.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 227. Dravidian and Indo-Aryan Temples at Badami. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nIf these views are correct, it is evident that though we may use the\r\nterm Indo-Aryan as the most convenient to describe and define the limits\r\nof the northern style, the name must not be considered as implying that\r\nthe Aryans, as such, had anything to do either with its invention or its\r\nuse. All that it is intended to convey is, that it was invented and used\r\nin a country which they once occupied, and in which they have left a\r\nstrong impress of their superior mental power and civilization.\r\n\r\nIf this reservation is always borne in mind, I know of no term that more\r\nconveniently expresses the characteristics of this style, and it is\r\nconsequently proposed to adopt it in the following pages as the name of\r\nthe style that prevailed among the Hindus in northern India, between the\r\nVindhya and Himalayan mountains, from the 7th century to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the northern temples, and the points of\r\ndifference between them and those of the south, will be appreciated from\r\nthe above woodcut (No. 227), representing two very ancient temples,\r\nbuilt in juxtaposition, at Badami, in Dharwar. That on the left is a\r\ncomplete specimen of Dravidian architecture. There is the same pyramidal\r\nform, the same distinction of storeys, the same cells on each, as we\r\nfind at Mahavellipore (Woodcut No. 181), at Tanjore (Woodcut No. 191),\r\nor at Mádura (Woodcut No. 183). In the right-hand temple, the\r\nIndo-Aryan, on the contrary, the outline of the pyramid is curvilinear;\r\nno trace of division of storeys is observable, no reminiscence of\r\nhabitations, and no pillars or pilasters anywhere. Even in its modern\r\nform (Woodcut No. 228), it still retains the same characteristics, and\r\nall the lines of the pyramid or sikra are curvilinear, the base\r\npolygonal. No trace of utilitarianism is visible anywhere. If Woodcut\r\nNo. 228 is compared with that at page 331 (Woodcut No. 183), the two\r\nstyles will be exhibited in their most modern garbs, when, after more\r\nthan 1000 years’ practice, they have receded furthest from the forms in\r\nwhich we first meet them Yet the Madras temple retains the memory of its\r\nstoreys and its cells. The Bengal example recalls nothing known in civil\r\nor domestic architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 228. Modern Temple at Benares.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 229. Diagram Plan of Hindu Temple.]\r\n\r\nNeither the pyramid nor the tumulus affords any suggestion as to the\r\norigin of the form, nor does the tower, either square or circular; nor\r\ndoes any form of civil or domestic architecture. It does not seem to be\r\nderived from any of these; and, whether we consider it as beautiful or\r\notherwise, it seems certainly to have been invented principally at least\r\nfor æsthetic purposes, and to have retained that impress from the\r\nearliest till the present day.\r\n\r\nThe plan of a northern temple is always a square internally, and\r\ngenerally the same form is retained in the exterior; but very rarely, if\r\never, without some addition. In some instances it is only a thin\r\nparallel projection, as at A in the diagram (No. 229). Sometimes it has\r\ntwo such slices added, as at B; but in the oldest examples these are\r\nonly half the thickness shown here. From this they proceeded to three\r\nprojections, as at C, the oldest examples being the thinnest. In more\r\nmodern times the thickness of the projections became equal to their\r\ndistance from each other, as at D; so that the temple became in plan\r\npractically a square, the sides of which were parallel to the diagonal\r\nof the original square or to the line E F G. Even, however, when this\r\nwas the case, the cell always retained its original form and direction,\r\nand the entrance and windows kept their position on what had thus\r\npractically become the angles of the building. This is the case with the\r\ntemple at Benares, shown in Woodcut No. 228, and generally also with the\r\nJaina temples, and especially the case with the temple on the\r\nTakht-i-Suleiman at Kashmir. Although the depth and width of these\r\noffsets vary considerably even in the same design, the original square\r\nis never lost sight of; the four central angles, as at F, being always\r\nlarger and more strongly accentuated than the others, and their line is\r\nalways carried through to the summit of the pyramid.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that by this process we have arrived at the same\r\nform or plan for a solid building that was attained by the arrangement\r\nof pillars described above, page 216. In fact, the two forms were\r\nelaborated simultaneously, and were afterwards constantly used together.\r\nMy impression is, that the pillared arrangement is the oldest, and led\r\nto the deepening of the additions to the solid square till the two\r\nbecame identical in plan. Whether this were so or not, it is one of the\r\nmost distinguishing features of northern Hindu architecture.\r\n\r\nIn the very centre of India, near a place marked Adjmîrghur on the map,\r\nis a sacred tank, from which it is said that the Soane flows to the\r\nnorth, the Mahanuddi to Cuttack in the Bay of Bengal, and the Nerbudda\r\nto the Indian Ocean. All these rivers certainly have their sources in\r\nthe hill. The spot has always been held sacred, and is surrounded by\r\ntemples--as far as can be gathered from the imperfect accounts\r\navailable--of great age. On the south and east of this hill extends the\r\ngreat and fertile table-land of Chutteesghur. This is now, and has\r\nalways been, so far as our knowledge extends, one of the principal seats\r\nof the native tribes. My conviction is, that if that country and the\r\nsurrounding valleys could be examined, much older forms of these temples\r\nmight be discovered--some perhaps so old as to betray the secret of\r\ntheir origin; but, till this is done, the Bengali devala must be\r\nrelegated--like the Irish round towers[413]--to the category of\r\nunexplained architectural puzzles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nORISSA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nHistory--Temples at Bhuvaneswar, Kanaruc, Puri, Jajepur, and Cuttack.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two provinces of India, where the Indo-Aryan style can be studied\r\nwith the greatest advantage, are Dharwar on the west, and Orissa on the\r\neast coast. The former has the advantage of being mixed up with the\r\nDravidian style, so as to admit of synonyms and contrasts that are\r\nsingularly interesting, both from an ethnological and historical point\r\nof view. In Orissa, on the contrary, the style is perfectly pure, being\r\nunmixed with any other, and thus forms one of the most compact and\r\nhomogeneous architectural groups in India, and as such of more than\r\nusual interest, and it is consequently in this province that the style\r\ncan be studied to the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\nOne of the most marked and striking peculiarities of Orissan\r\narchitecture is the marked and almost absolute contrast it presents to\r\nthe style of the Dravidian at the southern end of the peninsula. The\r\ncurved outline of the towers or vimanas has already been remarked upon,\r\nbut, besides this, no Orissan towers present the smallest trace of any\r\nstoreyed or even step-like arrangement, which is so universal further\r\nsouth, and the crowning member is never a dome, nor a reminiscence of\r\none. Even more remarkable than this, is the fact that the Orissan style\r\nis almost absolutely astylar. In some of the most modern examples, as\r\nfor instance in the porches added to the temples at Bhuvaneswar and Puri\r\nin the 12th and 14th centuries, we do find pillars, but it is probably\r\ncorrect to state that, among the 500 or 600[414] original shrines at\r\nBhuvaneswar, not one pillar is to be found. This is the more remarkable,\r\nbecause, within sight of that capital, the caves in the Udayagiri\r\n(_ante_, p. 140) are adorned with pillars to such an extent as to show\r\nthat their forms must have been usual and well known in the province\r\nbefore any of the temples were constructed. When we recollect that no\r\ngreat temple in the south was considered complete without its hall of\r\n1000 columns, and many besides this had hundreds dispersed about the\r\nplace, and used for every conceivable purpose, the contrast is more\r\nstriking, and shows what a complete barrier the Chalukyas, whoever they\r\nwere, interposed between the two races on this side of India, though not\r\non the other. As a rule, every Orissan temple consists of two\r\napartments, similar in plan, as shown in the diagram (Woodcut No. 124).\r\nThe inner one is generally a cube, surmounted by a tower, here called\r\nBara Deul, or Dewul, corresponding with the vimana of the south, and in\r\nit the image or images of the gods are enshrined; in front of this is a\r\nporch, called Jagamohan, equally a cube or approaching it, and\r\nsurmounted by a pyramidal roof of varying pitch. The peculiarities are\r\nillustrated in the diagram (Woodcut No. 124) just referred to, which\r\npurports to be an elevation of the celebrated Black Pagoda at Kanaruc.\r\nIt is only, however, an eye-sketch, and cannot be depended upon for\r\nminute detail and correctness, but it is sufficient to explain the\r\nmeaning of the text. Sometimes one or two more porches were added in\r\nfront of this one, and called Nât and Bhog mandirs (mantapas), but\r\nthese, in almost every instance, are afterthoughts, and not parts of the\r\noriginal design. Be this as it may, in every instance in Orissa the\r\ntower with its porch forms the temple. If enclosed in a wall, they are\r\nalways to be seen outside. There are gateways, it is true, but they are\r\nalways subordinate, and there are none of those accretions of enclosures\r\nand gopuras that form so marked a characteristic of the southern style.\r\nThere generally are other shrines within the enclosures of the great\r\ntemples, but they are always kept subordinate, and the temple itself\r\ntowers over everything to even a greater extent than that at Tanjore\r\n(Woodcut No. 191), giving a unity and purpose to the whole design, so\r\nfrequently wanting in the south.\r\n\r\nOther contrasts will come out as we proceed, but, in the meanwhile, few\r\nexamples bring out more clearly the vast importance of ethnography as\r\napplied to architecture. That two people, inhabiting practically the\r\nsame country, and worshipping the same gods under the guidance of the\r\nsame Brahmanical priesthood, should have adopted and adhered to two such\r\ndissimilar styles for their sacred buildings, shows as clearly as\r\nanything can well do how much race has to do with these matters, and how\r\nlittle we can understand the causes of such contrasts, unless we take\r\naffinities or differences of race into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\nThanks to the industry of Stirling and others, the main outlines of the\r\nhistory of Orissa have been ascertained with sufficient accuracy to\r\nenable us to describe its architecture without the fear of making any\r\nimportant chronological blunders. It is true that the dates of only two\r\nof its temples have been ascertained with tolerable certainty. The great\r\none at Bhuvaneswar is said to have been erected in or about A.D. 637,\r\nand that at Puri in A.D. 1174, nearly the first and the last of the\r\nseries. My impression is that the series may be carried back to about\r\nthe year 500, but in the other direction it can hardly be extended\r\nbeyond the year 1200, but within these limits it seems possible to\r\narrange the sequence of all the temples in the province without much\r\ndifficulty, and to ascertain their dates with at least a fair\r\napproximate certainty.[415]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the great temple of Juganât at Puri, all the\r\nbuildings described in this chapter were erected under the great Kesari\r\ndynasty, or “Lion line,” as Hunter calls them. Few of the particulars of\r\ntheir history have been recorded, but we know at least the date of their\r\naccession, A.D. 473, and that in A.D. 1131 they were succeeded by a new\r\ndynasty, called Ganga Vansa, the third of whom was the builder of the\r\ngreat Puri Temple.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in a previous part of this work, Orissa was principally\r\nBuddhist, at least from the time of Asoka, B.C. 250, till the Gupta era,\r\nA.D. 319, when all India was distracted by wars connected with the tooth\r\nrelic, which was said to have been preserved at Puri--then in\r\nconsequence called Danta Pura--till that time. If the invaders came by\r\nsea, as it is said they did, they probably were either Mughs from\r\nArrakan, or the Burmese of Pegu, and if their object was to obtain\r\npossession of the tooth, they as probably were Buddhists; but as they\r\nhave left no buildings that have yet been identified as theirs, it is\r\nimpossible now to determine this. Whoever they were, they were driven\r\nout, after 146 years’ possession, and were succeeded in or about A.D.\r\n473 by Yayati, the first of the Kesari line.[416] The annals of the race\r\nunfortunately do not tell us who the Kesaris were, or whence they came.\r\nFrom the third king before the Yavana invasion being called Bato Kesari,\r\nit seems probable it may have been only a revival of the old dynasty;\r\nand from the circumstances narrated regarding the expulsion of these\r\nstrangers, it looks as if it were due more to a local rising than to\r\nextraneous aid. If they came from the interior, it was from the\r\nnorth-west, where a similar style seems to have prevailed. Their story,\r\nas told in their own annals, states that the first, or one of the first\r\nkings of the race, imported, about the year A.D. 500, a colony--10,000\r\nBrahmans--from Ayodhya, and they being all bigoted Saivites, introduced\r\nthat religion into the province, and rooted it so firmly there, that it\r\nwas the faith of the land so long as the Kesaris ruled.[417] If we read\r\n100 as the number of the Brahmans, and A.D. 600 as the date of their\r\nadvent, we shall probably be nearer the truth; but be this as it may,\r\nthese Brahmans were settled at Jajepur, not at Bhuvaneswar, and soon\r\ncame into conflict with a class of “Old Brahmans,” who had been\r\nestablished in the province long before their arrival. Mr. Hunter\r\nsupposes them to have been Buddhists--Brahmans converted to the Buddhist\r\nfaith--which seems probable, but if this were so, they would certainly\r\nhave become Vaishnavas on the decline of that religion, and such, I\r\nfancy, was certainly the case in this instance.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the province seems to me to confirm this view of the\r\ncase, for, unless I am very much mistaken, the oldest temple in the city\r\nof Bhuvaneswar is that called Parasurameswara (Woodcut No. 230), which\r\nfrom its name, as well as the subjects portrayed on its walls, I would\r\ntake to be certainly Vaishnava. It may, however, belong to the preceding\r\ndynasty. Its style is certainly different from the early Kesari temples,\r\nand more like what we find in Dharwar and at other places outside the\r\nprovince. If, indeed, it were not found in a city which there seems\r\nevery reason for thinking was founded by the Lion kings, I would not\r\nhesitate to give it a date of A.D. 450, instead of A.D. 500. It is not\r\nlarge, being only 20 ft. square[418] at its base; but its sculptures\r\nare cut with a delicacy seldom surpassed, and there is an\r\nappropriateness about the ornaments greater than is seen in most of the\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 230. Temple of Parasurameswara. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe temple itself is apparently 38 ft. in height, and from the summit to\r\nthe base it is covered with sculptures of the most elaborate character,\r\nbut still without detracting from the simplicity and vigour of its\r\noutline.\r\n\r\nIf I am correct in assigning so early a date to the tower of this\r\ntemple, it is evident that the porch must be a subsequent addition: in\r\nthe first place, because it fits badly to the tower, but more because\r\nthe necessities of its construction require pillars internally, and they\r\ndo not occur in Orissan architecture till a long subsequent date. It\r\nmay, however, be that if this is really the oldest temple of its class\r\nin Orissa, its design may be copied from a foreign example, and\r\nborrowed, with all its peculiarities, from a style practised elsewhere.\r\nBe that as it may, it is interesting as showing the mode by which light\r\nwas sometimes introduced into the porches of these temples between the\r\nends of the beams of the stone roof. As the sloping roofing-stones\r\nproject considerably beyond the openings, a subdued light is introduced,\r\nwithout either the direct rays of the sun, or the rain being able to\r\npenetrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 231. Temple of Mukteswara. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe temple of Mukteswara (Woodcut No. 231) is very similar in general\r\ndesign to that of Parasurameswara, but even richer and more varied in\r\ndetail, and its porch partakes more of the regular Orissan type. It has\r\nno pillars internally, and the roof externally exhibits at least the\r\ngerm of what we find in the porches of the great temple at Bhuvaneswar\r\nand the Black Pagoda. Its dimensions are somewhat less than those of the\r\nlast temple described, but in its class it may be considered the gem of\r\nOrissan architecture.\r\n\r\nThe style of these temples differs so much from that of the next group,\r\nof which the great temple is the typical example, that I was at one time\r\ninclined to believe they may have belonged to different religions--this\r\none to the Vaishnava, that to the Saiva. I have no means, however, of\r\nverifying this conjecture, and it is not always easy to do so even on\r\nthe spot, for in India there is nothing so common as temples originally\r\ndestined for the worship of one deity being afterwards devoted to that\r\nof another. Whatever may be the case in this instance, it is well to\r\nbear this in mind, as, whenever we have a complete history of Orissan\r\narchitecture, these distinctions may lead to most important historical\r\ndeductions.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are several other temples which, from the style of\r\ntheir architecture, I would feel inclined to place as earlier than the\r\ngreat temple. One is known as Sari Dëul, near the great temple, and\r\nanother, a very complete and beautiful example, is called Moitre\r\n(_query_ Mittra) Serai, which is almost a duplicate, on a small scale,\r\nof the great temple, except that it has no repetition of itself on\r\nitself. As above pointed out, almost all the ornaments on the façades of\r\nBuddhist temples are repetitions of themselves; but the Hindus do not\r\nseem to have adopted this system so early, and the extent to which it is\r\ncarried is generally a fair test of the age of Hindu temples. In the\r\ngreat Pagoda there are eight copies of itself on each face, and in the\r\nRaj Rani the system is carried so far as almost to obliterate the\r\noriginal form of the temple.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT TEMPLE, BHUVANESWAR.\r\n\r\nThe great temple at Bhuvaneswar is one of the landmarks in the style. It\r\nseems almost certainly to have been built by Lelat Indra Kesari, who\r\nreigned from A.D. 617 to A.D. 657, and, taking it all in all, it is\r\nperhaps the finest example of a purely Hindu temple in India.\r\n\r\nThough not a building of the largest class, the dimensions of this\r\ntemple in plan are, so far as I can make out, far from contemptible. The\r\nwhole length is nearly 300 ft., with a breadth varying from 60 ft. to 75\r\nft. The original temple, however, like almost all those in Orissa,\r\nconsisted only of a vimana, or Bara Dewul, and a porch or Jagamohan,\r\nshaded darker in the plan (Woodcut No. 232), and they extend only to 160\r\nft. The Nat and Bhog-mandirs, shaded lighter, were added in the\r\nbeginning of the 12th century. Though several temples have all these\r\nfour apartments, so far as I can make out, none were originally erected\r\nwith them. The true Orissan temple is like that represented in Woodcut\r\nNo. 124, a building with two apartments only, and these astylar, or\r\npractically so: the pillars were only introduced in the comparatively\r\nmodern additions.\r\n\r\nThe outline of this temple in elevation is not, at first sight,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 232. Plan of Great Temple at Bhuvaneswar. (Compiled\r\npartly from Plan in Babu Rajendra’s work, but corrected from\r\nPhotographs. (Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.)]\r\n\r\npleasing to the European eye; but when once the eye is accustomed to it,\r\nit has a singularly solemn and pleasing aspect. It is a solid, and would\r\nbe a plain square tower, but for the slight curve at the top, which\r\ntakes off the hardness of the outline and introduces pleasingly the\r\ncircular crowning object (Woodcut No. 233). As compared with that at\r\nTanjore (Woodcut No. 191), it certainly is by far the finer design of\r\nthe two. In plan the southern example is the larger, being 82 ft.\r\nsquare. This one is only 66 ft.[419] from angle to angle, though it is\r\n75 ft. across the central projection. Their height is nearly the same,\r\nboth of them being over 180 ft., but the upper part of the northern\r\ntower is so much more solid, that the cubic contents of the two are\r\nprobably not very different. Besides, however, greater beauty in form,\r\nthe northern example excels the other immeasurably in the fact that it\r\nis wholly in stone from the base to the apex, and--what, unfortunately,\r\nno woodcut can show--every inch of the surface is covered with carving\r\nin the most elaborate manner. It is not only the divisions of the\r\ncourses, the roll-mouldings on the angles, or the breaks on the face of\r\nthe tower: these are sufficient to relieve its flatness, and with any\r\nother people they would be deemed sufficient; but every individual stone\r\nin the tower has a pattern carved upon it, not so as to break its\r\noutline, but sufficient to relieve any idea of monotony. It is, perhaps,\r\nnot an exaggeration to say that if it would take a sum--say a lakh of\r\nrupees or pounds--to erect such a building as this, it would take\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 233. View of Great Temple, Bhuvaneswar. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nthree lakhs to carve it as this one is carved. Whether such an outlay is\r\njudicious or not, is another question. Most people would be of opinion\r\nthat a building four times as large would produce a greater and more\r\nimposing architectural effect; but this is not the way a Hindu ever\r\nlooked at the matter. Infinite labour bestowed on every detail was the\r\nmode in which he thought he could render his temple most worthy of the\r\ndeity; and, whether he was right or wrong, the effect of the whole is\r\ncertainly marvellously beautiful. It is not, however, in those parts of\r\nthe building shown in the woodcut that the greatest amount of carving or\r\ndesign was bestowed, but in the perpendicular parts seen from the\r\ncourtyard (Woodcut No. 234). There the sculpture is of a very high order\r\nand great beauty of design. This, however, ought not to surprise when we\r\nrecollect that at Amravati, on the banks of the Kistnah, not far from\r\nthe southern boundary of this kingdom, there stood a temple more\r\ndelicate and elaborate in its carvings than any other building in\r\nIndia,[420] and that this temple had been finished probably not more\r\nthan a century before the Kesari dynasty was established in Orissa; and\r\nthough the history of art in India is written in decay, there was not\r\nmuch time for decline, and the dynasty was new and vigorous when this\r\ntemple was erected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 234. Lower part of Great Tower at Bhuvaneswar. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nAttached to the Jagamohan of this temple is a Nat-mandir, or\r\ndancing-hall, whose date is, fortunately, perfectly well known, and\r\nenables us to measure the extent of this decay with almost absolute\r\ncertainty. It was erected by the wife of Salini between the years 1099\r\nand 1104.[421] It is elegant, of course, for art had not yet perished\r\namong the Hindus, but it differs from the style of the porch to which it\r\nis attached more than the leanest example of Tudor art differs from the\r\nvigour and grace of the buildings of the early Edwards. All that power\r\nof expression is gone which enabled the early architects to make small\r\nthings look gigantic from the exuberance of labour bestowed upon them. A\r\nglance at the Nat-mandir is sufficient for the mastery of its details.\r\nA week’s study of the Jagamohan would every hour reveal new beauties.\r\n\r\nThe last woodcut may convey some idea of the extent to which the older\r\nparts were elaborated: but even the photograph hardly enables any one\r\nnot familiar with the style to realise how exquisite the combination of\r\nsolidity of mass with exuberance of ornament really is.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the four centuries and a half which elapsed between the erection\r\nof these two porches, Bhuvaneswar was adorned with some hundreds of\r\ntemples, some dozen of which have been photographed, but hardly in\r\nsufficient detail to enable the student to classify them according to\r\ntheir dates. On the spot[422] it probably would be easy for any one\r\ntrained to this class of study, and it would be a great gain if it were\r\ndone. The group nearest in richness and interest is that at Khajurâho,\r\nmentioned above (p. 245); but that group belongs to an age just\r\nsubsequent[423] to that of the Bhuvaneswar group, and only enables us to\r\nsee that some of the most elaborate of the Cuttack temples may extend to\r\nthe year 1000 or thereabouts. It is to this date that I would ascribe\r\nthe erection of the Raj Rani temple. The names of those of which I have\r\nphotographs, with their approximate data, are given in the list at the\r\nend of this chapter; but I refrain from burdening the text with their\r\nunpronounceable names, as I despair, by any reasonable number of\r\nwoodcuts, of illustrating their marvellous details in anything like a\r\nsatisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 235. Plan of Raj Rani Temple. (Compiled from a Plan by\r\nBabu Rajendra, and corrected from Photographs.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe Raj Rani temple, as will be seen from the woodcut (No. 235), is\r\nsmall; but the plan is arranged so as to give great variety and play of\r\nlight and shade, and as the details are of the most exquisite beauty, it\r\nis one of the gems of Orissan art. The following woodcut (No. 236),\r\nwithout attempting to illustrate the art, is quoted as characteristic of\r\nthe emblems of the Kesari line. Below the pillar are three kneeling\r\nelephants, over which domineer three lions, the emblems of the race.\r\nAbove this a Nagni, or female Naga, with her seven-headed snake-hood,\r\nadorns the upper part of the pillar. They are to be found, generally in\r\ngreat numbers, in almost all the temples of the province. Over the\r\ndoorway are the Nava\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 236. Doorway in Raj Rani Temple. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nGraha, or nine planets, which are almost more universal, both in temples\r\ndedicated to Vishnu and in those belonging to the worship of Siva.\r\nIndeed, in so far as any external signs are concerned, there does not\r\nseem to be any means by which the temples of the two religions can be\r\ndistinguished from one another. Throughout the province, from the time\r\nwe first meet it, about A.D. 500, till it dies out about A.D. 1200, the\r\nstyle seems to be singularly uniform in its features, and it requires\r\nconsiderable familiarity with it to detect its gradual progress towards\r\ndecay. Notwithstanding this, it is easy to perceive that there are two\r\nstyles of architecture in Orissa, which ran side by side with one\r\nanother during the whole course. The first is represented by the temples\r\nof Parasurameswara and Mukteswara (Woodcuts No. 230, 231); the second by\r\nthe great temple (Woodcut No. 233). They are not antagonistic, but\r\nsister styles, and seem certainly to have had at least partially\r\ndifferent origins. We can find affinities with that of the Mukteswara\r\ngroup in Dharwar and most parts of northern India: but I know of nothing\r\nexactly like the great temple anywhere else. It seems to be quite\r\nindigenous, and if not the most beautiful, it is the simplest and most\r\nmajestic of the Indo-Aryan styles. It may look like riding a hobby to\r\ndeath, but I cannot help suspecting a wooden origin for it--the courses\r\nlook so much more like carved logs of wood laid one upon another than\r\ncourses of masonry, and the mode and extent to which they are carved\r\ncertainly savours of the same material. There is a mosque built of\r\nDeodar pine in Kashmir, to be referred to hereafter, which certainly\r\nseems to favour this idea; but till we find some older temples than any\r\nyet discovered in Orissa this must remain in doubt. Meanwhile it may be\r\nwell to point out that about one-half of the older temples in Orissa\r\nfollow the type of the great temple, and one-half that of Mukteswara;\r\nbut the two get confounded together in the 8th and 9th centuries, and\r\nare mixed together into what may almost be called a new style in the\r\nRaj Rani and temples of the 10th and 11th centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANARUC.\r\n\r\nWith, perhaps, the single exception of the temple of Juganât at Puri,\r\nthere is no temple in India better known and about which more has been\r\nwritten than the so-called Black Pagoda at Kanaruc; nor is there any one\r\nwhose date and dedication is better known, if the literature on the\r\nsubject could be depended upon. Stirling does not hesitate in asserting\r\nthat the present edifice, “as is well known, was built by the Raja\r\nLangora Narsingh Deo, in A.D. 1241, under the superintendence of his\r\nminister Shibai Sautra;”[424] and every one who has since written on the\r\nsubject adopts this date without hesitation,[425] and the native records\r\nseem to confirm it. Complete as this evidence, at first sight, appears,\r\nI have no hesitation in putting it aside, for the simple reason that it\r\nseems impossible--after the erection of so degraded a specimen of the\r\nart as the temple of Puri (A.D. 1174)--the style ever could have\r\nreverted to anything so beautiful as this. In general design and detail\r\nit is so similar to the Jagamohan of the great temple at Bhuvaneswar\r\nthat at first sight I should be inclined to place it in the same\r\ncentury; but the details of the tower exhibit a progress towards modern\r\nforms which is unmistakeable,[426] and render a difference of date of\r\ntwo or possibly even three centuries more probable. Yet the only written\r\nauthority I know of for such a date is that given by Abul Fazl. After\r\ndescribing the temple, and ascribing it to Raja Narsingh Deo, in A.D.\r\n1241, with an amount of detail and degree of circumstantiality which has\r\ndeceived every one, he quietly adds that it is said “to be a work of 730\r\nyears’ antiquity.”[427] In other words, it was erected in A.D. 850 or\r\nA.D. 873, according to the date we assume for the composition of the\r\nAyeen Akbery. If there were a king of that name among the Rois fainéants\r\nof the Kesari line, this would suffice; but no such name is found in the\r\nlists.[428] This, however, is not final; for in an inscription on the\r\nBrahmaneswar temple the queen, who built it, mentions the names of her\r\nhusband, Udyalaka, and six of his ancestors; but neither he nor any of\r\nthem are to be found in the lists except the first, Janmejaya, and it is\r\ndoubtful whether even he was a Kesari king or the hero of the\r\n‘Mahabharata.’[429] In all this uncertainty we have really nothing to\r\nguide us but the architecture, and its testimony is so distinct that it\r\ndoes not appear to me doubtful that this temple really belongs to the\r\nlatter half of the 9th century.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest connected with this temple is, that all\r\nauthors, apparently following Abul Fazl, agree that it was like the\r\ntemple of Marttand, in Kashmir (_ante_, p. 287), dedicated to the sun. I\r\nhave never myself seen a Sun temple in India, and being entirely\r\nignorant of the ritual of the sect, I would not wish to appear to\r\ndogmatise on the subject; but I have already expressed my doubts as to\r\nthe dedication of Marttand, and I may be allowed to repeat them here.\r\nThe traces of Sun worship in Bengal are so slight that they have escaped\r\nme, as they have done the keen scrutiny of the late H. H. Wilson.[430]\r\n\r\nIn the Vedas it appears that Vishnu is called the Sun, or it may be the\r\nsun bears the name of Vishnu;[431] and this may account, perhaps, for\r\nthe way in which the name has come to be applied to this temple, which\r\ndiffers in no other respect from the other temples of Vishnu found in\r\nOrissa. The architectural forms are identical; they are adorned with the\r\nsame symbols. The Nava Graha, or nine planets, adorn the lintel of this\r\nas of all the temples of the Kesari line. The seven-headed serpent-forms\r\nare found on every temple of the race, from the great one at Bhuvaneswar\r\nto this one, and it is only distinguishable from those of Siva by the\r\nobscenities that disfigure a part of its sculptures. This is,\r\nunfortunately only too common a characteristic of Vaishnava temples all\r\nover India, but is hardly, if ever, found in Saiva temples, and never\r\nwas, so far as I know, a characteristic of the worship of the Sun god.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, the great beauty of this temple arises from the form of\r\nthe design of the roof of the Jagamohan, or porch--the only part now\r\nremaining. Both in dimensions and detail, it is extremely like that of\r\nthe great temple at Bhuvaneswar, but it is here divided into three\r\nstoreys instead of two, which is an immense improvement, and it rises at\r\na more agreeable angle. The first and second storeys consist of six\r\ncornices each, the third of five only, as shown in the diagram Woodcut\r\nNo. 124. The two lower ones are carved with infinite beauty and variety\r\non all their twelve faces, and the antefixæ at the angles and breaks are\r\nused with an elegance and judgment a true Yavana could hardly have\r\nsurpassed. There is, so far as I know, no roof in India where the same\r\nplay of light and shade is obtained with an equal amount of richness and\r\nconstructive propriety as in this instance, nor one that sits so\r\ngracefully on the base that supports it.\r\n\r\nInternally, the chamber is singularly plain, but presents some\r\nconstructive peculiarities worthy of attention. On the floor it is about\r\n40 ft. square, and the walls rise plain to about the same height. Here\r\nit begins to bracket inwards, till it contracts to about 20 ft., where\r\nit was ceiled with a flat stone roof, supported by wrought-iron\r\nbeams--Stirling says nine, nearly 1 ft. square by 12 ft. to 18 ft.\r\nlong.[432] My measurements made the section less--8 in. to 9 in., but\r\nthe length greater, 23 ft.; and Babu Rajendra points out that one, 21\r\nft. long, has a square section of 8 in. at the end, but a depth of 11\r\nin. in the centre,[433] showing a knowledge of the properties and\r\nstrength of the material that is remarkable in a people who are now so\r\nutterly incapable of forging such masses. The iron pillar at Delhi\r\n(Woodcut No. 281) is even a more remarkable example than this, and no\r\nsatisfactory explanation has yet been given as to the mode in which it\r\nwas manufactured. Its object, however, is plain, while the employment of\r\nthese beams here is a mystery. They were not wanted for strength, as the\r\nbuilding is still firm after they have fallen, and so expensive a false\r\nceiling was not wanted architecturally to roof so plain a chamber. It\r\nseems to be only another instance of that profusion of labour which the\r\nHindus loved to lavish on the temples of their gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURI.\r\n\r\nWhen from the capital we turn to Puri, we find a state of affairs more\r\naltered than might be expected from the short space of time that had\r\nelapsed between the building of the Black Pagoda and the celebrated one\r\nnow found there. It is true the dynasty had changed. In 1131, the Kesari\r\nVansa, with their Saiva worship, had been superseded by the Ganga Vansa,\r\nwho were apparently as devoted followers of Vishnu; and they set to work\r\nat once to signalise their triumph by erecting the temple to Juganât,\r\nwhich has since acquired such a world-wide celebrity.\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, to be supposed that the kings of the Ganga line\r\nwere the first to introduce the worship of Vishnu to Orissa. The whole\r\ntraditions, as recorded by Stirling, contradict such an assumption, and\r\nthe first temple erected on this spot to the deity is said to have been\r\nbuilt by Yayati, the founder of the Kesari line.[434] He it was who\r\nrecovered the sacred image of Juganât from the place where it had been\r\nburied 150 years before, on the invasion of the Yavanas, and a “new\r\ntemple was erected by him on the site of the old one, which was found to\r\nbe much dilapidated and overwhelmed with sand.”[435] This, of course,\r\nwas before the arrival of the Ayodhya Brahmans alluded to above, who,\r\nthough they may have retained possession of the capital during the\r\ncontinuance of the dynasty, did not apparently interfere with the rival\r\nworship in the provinces.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be contrary to all experience if, in a country where\r\nBuddhism once existed, those who were followers of that faith had not\r\ndegenerated first into Jainism and then into Vishnuism. At Udayagiri we\r\nhave absolute proof in the caves of the first transition, and that it\r\ncontinued there till the time when the Mahrattas erected the little\r\ntemple on the southern peak. In like manner, there seems little doubt\r\nthat the tooth relic was preserved at Puri till the invasion of the\r\nYavanas, apparently, as before mentioned, to obtain possession of it.\r\nAccording to the Buddhist version, it was buried in the jungle, but dug\r\nup again shortly afterwards, and conveyed to Ceylon.[436] According to\r\nthe Brahmanical account, it was the image of Juganât, and not the tooth,\r\nthat was hidden and recovered on the departure of the Yavanas, and then\r\nwas enshrined at Juganât in a new temple on the sands. The tradition of\r\na bone of Krishna being contained in the image[437] is evidently only a\r\nBrahmanical form of Buddhist relic worship, and, as has been frequently\r\nsuggested, the three images of Juganât, his brother Balbhadra, and the\r\nsister Subhadhra, are only the Buddhist trinity--Buddha, Dharma,\r\nSanga--disguised to suit the altered condition of belief among the\r\ncommon people. The pilgrimage, the Rât Jutra, the suspension of caste\r\nprejudices, everything in fact at Puri, is redolent of Buddhism, but of\r\nBuddhism so degraded as hardly to be recognisable by those who know that\r\nfaith only in its older and purer form.\r\n\r\nThe degradation of the faith, however, is hardly so remarkable as that\r\nof the style. Even Stirling, who was no captious critic, remarks that it\r\nseems unaccountable, in an age when the architects obviously possessed\r\nsome taste and skill, and were in most cases particularly lavish in the\r\nuse of sculptural ornament, so little pains should have been taken with\r\nthe decoration and finishing of this sacred and stupendous edifice.[438]\r\nIt is not, however, only in the detail, but the outline, the\r\nproportions, and every arrangement of the temple, show that the art in\r\nthis province at least had received a fatal downward impetus from which\r\nit never recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 237. Plan of Temple of Juganât at Puri. (From a Plan by\r\nR. P. Mukerji.)\r\n\r\nScale 200 fᵗ. to the Inch]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the annexed plan[439] (Woodcut No. 237), this\r\ntemple has a double enclosure, a thing otherwise unknown in the north.\r\nExternally it measures 670 ft. by 640 ft., and is surrounded by a wall\r\n20 ft. to 30 ft. high, with four gates. The inner enclosure measures 420\r\nft. by 315 ft., and is enclosed by a double wall with four openings.\r\nWithin this last stands the Bara Dewul, A, measuring 80 ft. across the\r\ncentre, or 5 ft. more than the great temple at Bhuvaneswar; with its\r\nporch or Jagamohan, B, it measures 155 ft. east and west, while the\r\ngreat tower rises to a height of 192 ft.[440] Beyond this two other\r\nporches were afterwards added, the Nat-mandir, C, and Bhog-mandir, D,\r\nmaking the whole length of the temple about 300 ft., or as nearly as may\r\nbe the same as that at Bhuvaneswar. Besides this there are, as in all\r\ngreat Hindu temples, numberless smaller shrines within the two\r\nenclosures, but, as in all instances in the north, they are kept\r\nsubordinate to the principal one, which here towers supreme over all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 238. View of Tower of Temple of Juganât. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nExcept in its double enclosure, and a certain irregularity of plan, this\r\ntemple does not differ materially in arrangement from the great ones at\r\nBhuvaneswar and elsewhere; but besides the absence of detail already\r\nremarked upon, the outline of its vimana is totally devoid either of\r\nthat solemn solidity of the earlier examples, or the grace that\r\ncharacterised those subsequently erected; and when we add to this that\r\nwhitewash and paint have done their worst to add vulgarity to forms\r\nalready sufficiently ungraceful, it will easily be understood that\r\nthis, the most famous, is also the most disappointing of northern Hindu\r\ntemples.[441] As may be seen from the preceding illustration (Woodcut\r\nNo. 238), the parts are so nearly the same as those found in all the\r\nolder temples at Bhuvaneswar, that the difference could hardly be\r\nexpressed in words; even the woodcut, however, is sufficient to show how\r\nchanged they are in effect, but the building itself should be seen fully\r\nto appreciate the degradation that has taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAJEPUR AND CUTTACK.\r\n\r\nJajepur, on the Byturni, was one of the old capitals of the province,\r\nand even now contains temples which, from the squareness of their forms,\r\nmay be old, but, if so, they have been so completely disguised by a\r\nthick coating of plaster, that their carvings are entirely obliterated,\r\nand there is nothing by which their age can be determined. The place was\r\nlong occupied by the Mahomedans, and the presence of a handsome mosque\r\nmay account for the disappearance of some at least of the Hindu remains.\r\nThere is one pillar, however, still standing, which deserves to be\r\nillustrated as one of the most pleasing examples of its class in India\r\n(Woodcut No. 239). Its proportions are beautiful, and its details in\r\nexcellent taste; but the mouldings of the base, which are those on which\r\nthe Hindus were accustomed to lavish the utmost care, have unfortunately\r\nbeen destroyed. Originally it is said to have supported a figure of\r\nGaruda--the Vahana of Vishnu--and a figure is pointed out as the\r\nidentical one. It may be so, and if it is the case, the pillar is of the\r\n12th or 13th century. This also seems to be the age of some remarkable\r\npieces of sculpture which were discovered some years ago on the brink of\r\nthe river, where they had apparently been hidden from Mahomedan bigotry.\r\nThey are in quite a different style from anything at Bhuvaneswar or\r\nKanaruc, and probably more modern than anything at those places.\r\n\r\nCuttack became the capital of the country in A.D. 989-1006, when a\r\ncertain Markut Kesari built a stone revêtement to protect the site from\r\nencroachment of the river.[442] It too, however, has suffered, first\r\nfrom the intolerant bigotry of the Moslem, and afterwards from the\r\nstolid indifference[443] of the British rulers, so that very little\r\nremains; but for this the nine-storeyed palace of Mukund Deo, the\r\ncontemporary of Akbar, might still remain to us in such a state at least\r\nas to be intelligible. We hear so much, however, of these nine-storeyed\r\npalaces and viharas, that it may be worth while quoting Abul Fazl’s\r\ndescription of this one, in order to enable us to understand some of the\r\nallusions and descriptions we afterwards may meet with:--“In Cuttack,”\r\nhe says, “there is a fine palace, built by Rajah Mukund Deo, consisting\r\nof nine storeys. The first storey is for elephants, camels, and horses;\r\nthe second for artillery and military stores, where also are quarters\r\nfor the guards and other attendants; the third is occupied by porters\r\nand watchmen; the fourth is appropriated for the several artificers; the\r\nkitchens make the fifth range; the sixth contains the Rajah’s public\r\napartments; the seventh is for the transaction of private business; the\r\neighth is where the women reside; and the ninth is the Rajah’s sleeping\r\napartment. To the south,” he adds, “of this palace is a very ancient\r\nHindu temple.”[444]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 239. Hindu Pillar in Jajepur.\r\n\r\n(From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAs Orissa at the period when this was written was practically a part of\r\nAkbar’s kingdom, there seems little doubt that this description was\r\nfurnished by some one who knew the place. There are seven-storeyed\r\npalaces at Jeypur and Bijapur still standing, which were erected about\r\nthis date, and one of five storeys in Akbar’s own palace at Futtehpore\r\nSikri, but none, so far as I know, of nine storeys, though I see no\r\nreason for doubting the correctness of the description of the one just\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 240. Hindu Bridge at Cuttack. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough it thus consequently happens that we have no more means of\r\nascertaining what the civil edifices of the Indo-Aryans of Orissa were\r\nlike, than we have of those of the contemporary Dravidians, there is a\r\ngroup of engineering objects which throw some light on the arts of the\r\nperiod. As has been frequently stated above, the Hindus hate an arch,\r\nand never will use it except under compulsion. The Mahomedans taught\r\nthem to get over their prejudices and employ the arch in their civil\r\nbuildings in later times, but to the present day they avoid it in their\r\ntemples in so far as it is possible to do so. In Orissa, however, in the\r\n13th century, they built numerous bridges in various parts of the\r\nprovince, but never employed a true arch in any of them. The Atarah\r\nNullah bridge at Puri, built by Kebir Narsingh Deo, about 1250, has been\r\ndrawn and described by Stirling, and is the finest in the province of\r\nthose still in use. Between the abutments it is 275 ft. long, and with a\r\nroadway 35 ft. wide. That shown in the above woodcut (No. 240) is\r\nprobably older, and certainly more picturesque, though constructed on\r\nthe same identical plan. It may be unscientific, but many of these old\r\nbridges are standing and in use, while many of those we have constructed\r\nout of the ruins of the temples and palaces have been swept away as if a\r\ncurse were upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe above may be considered as a somewhat meagre account of one of the\r\nmost complete and interesting styles of Indian architecture. It would,\r\nhowever, be impossible to do it justice without an amount of\r\nillustration incompatible with the scope of this work, and with details\r\ndrawn on a larger scale than its pages admit of. It is to be hoped that\r\nBabu Rajendra’s work may, to some extent, at least, supply this\r\ndeficiency. The first volume can only, however, be considered as\r\nintroductory, being wholly occupied with preliminary matters, and\r\navoiding all dates or descriptions of particular buildings. The second,\r\nwhen it appears, may remedy this defect, and it is to be hoped will do\r\nso, as a good monograph of the Orissan style would convey a more correct\r\nidea of what Indian art really is than a similar account of any other\r\nstyle we are acquainted with in India. From the erection of the temple\r\nof Parasurameswara, A.D. 500, to that of Juganât at Puri, A.D. 1174, the\r\nstyle steadily progresses without any interruption or admixture of\r\nforeign elements, while the examples are so numerous that one might be\r\nfound for every fifty years of the period--probably for every\r\ntwenty--and we might thus have a chronometric scale of Hindu art during\r\nthese seven centuries that would be invaluable for application to other\r\nplaces or styles. It is also in Orissa, if anywhere that we may hope to\r\nfind the _incunabula_ that will explain much that is now mysterious in\r\nthe forms of the temples and the origin of many parts of their\r\nornamentation. An examination, for instance, of a hundred or so of the\r\nruined and half-ruined temples of the province would enable any\r\ncompetent person to say at once how far the theory above enunciated\r\n(Woodcut No. 124)--to account for the curved form of the towers--was or\r\nwas not in accordance with the facts of the case, and, if opposed to\r\nthem, what the true theory of the curved form really was. In like\r\nmanner, it seems hardly doubtful that a careful examination of a great\r\nnumber of examples would reveal the origin of the amalaka crowning\r\nornament. I feel absolutely convinced, as stated above, that it did not\r\ngrow out of the berry of the _Phyllanthus emblica_, and am very doubtful\r\nif it had a vegetable origin at all. But no one yet has suggested any\r\nother theory which will bear examination, and it is only from the\r\nearliest temples themselves that any satisfactory answer can be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nIt is not only, however, that these and many other technical questions\r\nwill be answered when any competent person undertakes a thorough\r\nexamination of the ruins, but they will afford a picture of the\r\ncivilization and of the arts and religion of an Indian community during\r\nseven centuries of isolation from external influences, such as can\r\nhardly be obtained from any other source. So far as we at present know,\r\nit is a singularly pleasing picture, and one that will well repay any\r\npains that may be taken to present it to the English public in a\r\ncomplete and intelligible form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTATIVE LIST OF DATES AND DIMENSIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL ORISSAN TEMPLES.\r\n\r\n                                          External      Internal\r\n                                         Dimensions    Dimensions\r\nDates.                                   of Towers.     of Cells.\r\n\r\n                                          ft.    ft.    ft.    ft.\r\n500-600  { Parasurameswara                20  ×  20     11  ×   9\r\n         { Mukteswara                     14  ×  14      6  ×   6\r\n600-700  { Sari Dewala                    24  ×  22     12  ×  12\r\n         { Moitre Serai\r\n         { Ananta Vasu Deva               26  ×  26     16  ×  14\r\n657        Bhuvaneswar                    66  ×  60     42  ×  42\r\n         { Sideswara\r\n700-850  { Vitala Devi\r\n         { Markandeswara in Puri\r\n         { Brahmeswara\r\n873        Kanaruc                        60  ×  60     40  ×  40 (?)\r\n900-1000 { Kedareswar\r\n         { Raj Rani                       32  ×  25     12  ×  12\r\n1104       Nat Mandir at Bhuvaneswar\r\n1198       Juganât, Puri                  73  ×  73     29  ×  29[445]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWESTERN INDIA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nDharwar--Brahmanical Rock-cut Temples.\r\n\r\n\r\nDHARWAR.\r\n\r\nIf the province of Orissa is interesting from the completeness and\r\nuniformity of its style of Indo-Aryan architecture, that of Dharwar, or,\r\nmore correctly speaking of Maharastra, is almost equally so from exactly\r\nthe opposite conditions. In the western province, the Dravidian style\r\nstruggles with the northern for supremacy during all the earlier stages\r\nof their growth, and the mode in which the one influenced the other will\r\nbe one of the most interesting and instructive lessons we can learn from\r\ntheir study, when the materials exist for a thorough investigation of\r\nthe architectural history of this province. In magnificence, however,\r\nthe western can never pretend to rival the eastern province. There are\r\nmore and far finer buildings in the one city of Bhuvaneswar alone than\r\nin all the cities of Maharastra put together, and the extreme\r\nelaboration of their details gives the Orissan examples a superiority\r\nthat the western temples cannot pretend to rival.\r\n\r\nAmong the oldest and most characteristic of the Dharwar temples is that\r\nof Papanatha, at Purudkul, or Pittadkul, as it is now spelt. As will be\r\nseen from the plan of this temple given above (Woodcut No. 122, page\r\n221), the cell, with its tower, has not the same predominating\r\nimportance which it always had in Orissa; and instead of a mere\r\nvestibule it has a four-pillared porch, which would in itself be\r\nsufficient to form a complete temple on the eastern side of India.\r\nBeyond this, however, is the great porch, Mantapa, or Jagamohan--square,\r\nas usual, but here it possesses sixteen pillars, in four groups, instead\r\nof the astylar arrangements so common in the east. It is, in fact, a\r\ncopy, with very slight alterations, of the plan of the great Saiva\r\ntemple at the same place (Woodcut No. 189), or the Kylas at Ellora\r\n(Woodcut No. 186). These, with others recently brought to light, form a\r\ngroup of early temples wholly Dravidian in style, but having no\r\naffinity, except in plan, with the Temple of Papanatha, which is as\r\nessentially Indo-Aryan in all its architectural arrangements. This, in\r\nfact, may be looked upon as the characteristic difference between the\r\nstyles of Dharwar and Orissa. The western style, from its proximity to\r\nthe Dravidian and admixture with it, in fact, used pillars freely and\r\nwith effect whenever wanted; while their use in Orissa is almost unknown\r\nin the best ages of the style, and their introduction, as it took place\r\nthere, showed only too clearly the necessity that had arisen in the\r\ndecay of the style, to supply with foreign forms the want of originality\r\nof invention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 241. View of Temple of Papanatha at Pittadkul. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe external effect of the building may be judged of from the above\r\nwoodcut (No. 241). The outline of the tower is not unlike that of the\r\nParasurameswara temple at Bhuvaneswar, with which it was probably\r\ncontemporary--circa A.D. 500--but the central belt is more pronounced,\r\nand always apparently was on the west side of India. It will also be\r\nobserved in this tower that every third course has on the angle a form\r\nwhich has just been described as an amalaka in speaking of the crowning\r\nmembers of Orissan temples. Here it looks as if the two intermediate\r\ncourses simulated roofs, or a roof in two storeys, and then this\r\ncrowning member was introduced, and the same thing repeated over and\r\nover again till the requisite height was obtained. In the\r\nParasurameswara there are three intermediate courses (Woodcut No. 230);\r\nin the great tower at Bhuvaneswar, five; and in the more modern temples\r\nthey disappear from the angles, but are supplied by the miniature\r\ntemple-forms applied to the sides. In the temple at Buddh Gaya the same\r\nform occurs (Woodcut No. 16) on the angle of each storey; but there it\r\nlooks more like the capital of a pillar, which, in fact, I believe to be\r\nits real original. But from whatever form derived, this repetition on\r\nthe angles is in the best possible taste; the eye is led upwards by it,\r\nand is prepared for the crowning member, which is thus no longer\r\nisolated and alone, but a part of a complete design.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the repetition of this ornament is, so far as is now\r\nknown, no bad test of the age of a temple. If an example were found\r\nwhere every alternate course was an amalaka, it probably would be older\r\nthan any temple we have yet known. It would then represent a series of\r\nroofs, five, seven, or nine storeys, built over one another. It had,\r\nhowever, passed into conventionalities before we meet with it.\r\n\r\nWhenever the temples of this district are thoroughly investigated, they\r\nwill, no doubt, throw immense light on the early history of the\r\nstyle.[446] As the case now stands, however, the principal interest\r\ncentres in the caves of Badami, which being the only Brahmanical caves\r\nknown that have positive dates upon them, they give us a fixed point\r\nfrom which to reason in respect of other series such as we have never\r\nhad before. For the present, they must make way for other examples\r\nbetter known and of more general architectural interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAHMANICAL ROCK-CUT TEMPLES.\r\n\r\nAlthough the structural temples of the Badami group[447] in Dharwar are\r\nof such extreme interest, as has been pointed out above, they are\r\nsurpassed in importance, for our present purposes at least, by the\r\nrock-cut examples.\r\n\r\nAt Badami there are three caves, not of any great dimensions, but of\r\nsingular interest from their architectural details and sculptures, and\r\nmore so from the fact that one of them, No. 3, contains an inscription\r\nwith an undoubted date upon it. There are, as pointed out above,\r\ninnumerable Buddhist inscriptions on the western caves, but none with\r\ndates from any well-ascertained era, and none, unfortunately, of the\r\nBrahmanical caves at Ellora or elsewhere have inscriptions that can be\r\ncalled integral, and not one certainly with a date on it. The\r\nconsequence is, that the only mode by which their ages could be\r\napproximated was by arranging them in sequences, according to our\r\nempirical or real knowledge of the history of the period during which\r\nthey were supposed to have been excavated. At Ellora, for instance, it\r\nwas assumed that the Buddhist preceded the Brahmanical excavations, and\r\nthat these were succeeded by the Jaina; and various local and\r\narchitectural peculiarities rendered this hypothesis extremely probable.\r\nArguing on this basis, it was found that the one chaitya cave there, the\r\nViswakarma, was nearly identical in style with the last of the four\r\nchaityas at Ajunta (No. 26), and that cave, for reasons given above, was\r\nplaced at the end of the 6th century, say A.D. 600. The caves next it\r\nwere assumed to occupy the 7th century, thus leading on to the Rameswara\r\ngroup, about A.D. 700, and the Jaina group would then have occupied the\r\nnext century. The age of the Kylas or Dravidian group, being\r\nexceptional, could only be determined by extraneous evidence, and, as\r\nalready pointed out, from its extreme similarity with the great temple\r\nat Pittadkul, belongs almost certainly to the 8th century; and from a\r\nsimilar chain of reasoning the Jaina group is brought back to about the\r\nsame age, or rather earlier, say A.D. 650.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the No. 3 cave at Badami is dated in the twelfth year\r\nof the reign of a well-known king, Mangaliswara, in the 500th year after\r\nthe inauguration of the Saka king, or in 79; the date therefore is A.D.\r\n579. Admitting, which I think its architecture renders nearly certain,\r\nthat it is the earliest of the three, still they are so like one\r\nanother, that the latest must be assumed to have been excavated within\r\nthe limits of the next century, say A.D. 575-700. Comparing the\r\narchitecture of this group with that known as the central or Rameswara\r\ngroup at Ellora, it is so nearly identical, that though it may be\r\nslightly more modern, it can hardly now be doubted they too, including\r\nperhaps the cave known as the Ashes of Ravana, must have been excavated\r\nin the 7th century. Instead, therefore, of the sequence formerly\r\nadopted, we are forced to fall back on that marvellous picture of\r\nreligious toleration described by the Chinese Pilgrim as exhibited at\r\nAllahabad in the year A.D. 643. On that occasion the King Siladitya\r\ndistributed alms or gifts to 10,000 priests (_religieux_), the first day\r\nin honour of Buddha, the second of Aditya the Sun (Vishnu?), and the\r\nthird in honour of Iswara or Siva;[448] and the eighteen kings who\r\nassisted at this splendid quinquennial festival seem promiscuously to\r\nhave honoured equally these three divinities. With this toleration at\r\nhead-quarters, we ought not to be surprised if we find the temples of\r\nthe three religions overlapping one another to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is, that one of the greatest difficulties an\r\nantiquary experiences before the 8th century, is to ascertain to what\r\ndivinity any temple or a cave is dedicated. In the three caves, for\r\ninstance, at Badami, the sculptures are wholly Vaishnava, and no one\r\nwould doubt that they were dedicated to that deity, but in the\r\nsanctuaries of all is the lingam or emblem of Siva. It has been\r\nsuggested that this may have been an afterthought, but if so the cave\r\nmust have been without meaning. There is no sinhasan or throne on which\r\nan image of a deity could be placed, nor is the cell large enough for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are no Buddhist buildings or caves so far south as\r\nBadami, and we are consequently deprived of that means for comparison;\r\nand before anything very definite can be laid down, it will require that\r\nsome one familiar with the subject should go over the whole of the\r\nwestern caves, and institute a rigid comparison of their details.\r\nMeanwhile, however, the result of the translations of the inscriptions\r\ngathered by Mr. Burgess, and of his plans and views,[449] is that we\r\nmust compress our history of the western caves within narrower limits\r\nthan originally seemed necessary.[450] The buildings in the Dharwar\r\ndistrict seem all to be comprised between the years 500 and 750 A.D.,\r\nwith probably a slight extension either way, and those at Ellora being\r\ncertainly synchronous, must equally be limited to the same period of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPending a more complete investigation, which I hope may be undertaken\r\nbefore long, I would propose the following as a tentative chronology of\r\nthe far-famed series of caves at Ellora:--\r\n\r\nBuddhist:--Viswakarma to Das Avatara              A.D. 500-600\r\nJaina:--Indra, Juganât, Subhas, &c.                    550-650\r\nHindu:--Rameswara to Dhumnar Lena                      600-750\r\nDravidian:--Kylas                                      725-800\r\n\r\nThe cave at Elephanta follows of course the date here given for the\r\nDhumnar Lena, and must thus date after the middle of the 8th\r\ncentury.[451]\r\n\r\nThese dated caves and buildings have also rendered another service to\r\nthe science of archæology, inasmuch as they enable us to state with\r\nconfidence that the principal caves at Mahavellipore must be\r\ncircumscribed within the same limits. The architecture there being so\r\nlean and poor, is most misleading, but, as hinted above, I believe it\r\narose from the fact that it was Dravidian, and copied literally from\r\nstructural buildings, by people who had not the long experience of the\r\nBuddhists in cave architecture to guide them, for there seems to have\r\nbeen no Buddhists so far south. But be that as it may, a comparison of\r\nthe Hindu sculptures at Badami with those of Ellora on the one hand, and\r\nMahavellipore on the other, renders it almost absolutely certain that\r\nthey were practically contemporary. The famous bas-relief of Durga, on\r\nher lion, slaying Mahasura, the Minotaur,[452] is earlier than one very\r\nsimilar to it at Ellora; and one, the Viratarupa,[453] is later by\r\nprobably a century than the sculpture of the same subject in cave 3 at\r\nBadami.[454] Some of the other bas-reliefs are later, some earlier, than\r\nthose representing similar subjects in the three series, but it seems\r\nnow impossible to get over the fact that they are practically\r\nsynchronous. Even the great bas-relief, which I was inclined to assign\r\nto a more modern period, probably belongs to the 7th or 8th century. The\r\ngreat Naga king, whom all the world are there worshipping, is\r\nrepresented as a man whose head is shaded by a seven-headed\r\nserpent-hood, but also with a serpent-body from the waist downwards.\r\nThat form was not known in the older Buddhist sculptures, but has now\r\nbeen found on all the Orissan temples (for instance Woodcut No. 236),\r\nand nearly as frequently at Badami.[455] This difficulty being removed,\r\nthere seems no reason why this gigantic sculpture should not take the\r\nplace, which its state of execution would otherwise assign to it--say\r\nA.D. 700--as a mean date, subject to subsequent adjustment.\r\n\r\nIn a general work like the present it is of course impossible to\r\nillustrate so extensive a group as that of the Brahmanical caves to such\r\nan extent as to render their history or affinities intelligible to those\r\nwho have not by other means become familiar with the subject.\r\nFortunately, however, in this instance the materials exist by which any\r\none may attain the desired information with very little difficulty.\r\nDaniell’s drawings--or rather Mr. Wales’--made in 1795, have long made\r\nthe public acquainted with the principal caves at Ellora; Sir Charles\r\nMalet’s paper in the sixth volume of the ‘Asiatic Researches;’ Seely’s\r\n‘Wonders of Ellora,’ published in 1820, and numerous other works, with\r\nthe photographs now available, supply nearly all that can be desired in\r\nthat direction. The same may be said of Elephanta, which has been\r\nexhaustively treated by Mr. Burgess in the work above referred to.\r\nChambers’ paper in the second volume of the ‘Transactions of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society,’ supplies, with Dr. Hunter’s photographs, a vast amount\r\nof information regarding the Mahavellipore antiquities; and Mr.\r\nBurgess’s recent report on the Dharwar caves completes, to a great\r\nextent, the information wanted to understand the peculiarities of the\r\ngroup. Notwithstanding this, it is well worthy of a monograph, insomuch\r\nas it affords the only representation of the art and mythology of the\r\nHindus on the revival of their religion, which was commenced by the\r\nGuptas A.D. 318-465, but really inaugurated by the great Vicramaditya,\r\nA.D. 495-530, and which, when once started, continued to nourish till\r\nthe great collapse in the 8th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 242. Pillar in Kylas, Ellora.\r\n\r\n(From a Drawing by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the subject is one more suited to the purposes of\r\nthe mythologist and the sculptor than to the architect. Like all\r\nrock-cut examples, except the Dravidian, the caves have the intolerable\r\ndefect of having no exteriors, and consequently no external\r\narchitectural form. The only parts of them which strictly belong to\r\narchitectural art are their pillars, and though a series of them would\r\nbe interesting, they vary so much, from the nature of the material in\r\nwhich they are carved, and from local circumstances, that they do not\r\npossess the same historical significance that external forms would\r\nafford. Such a pillar, for instance, as this one from the cave called\r\nLanka, on the side of the pit in which the Kylas stands (Woodcut No.\r\n242), though in exquisite taste as a rock-cut example, where the utmost\r\nstrength is apparently required to support the mass of rock above, does\r\nnot afford any points of comparison with structural examples of the same\r\nage. In a building it would be cumbersome and absurd; under a mass of\r\nrock it is elegant and appropriate. The pillars in the caves at\r\nMahavellipore fail from the opposite fault: they retain their structural\r\nform, though used in the rock, and look frail and weak in consequence;\r\nbut while this diversity in practice prevailed, it prevents their use as\r\na chronometric scale being appreciated, as it would be if the practice\r\nhad been uniform. As, however, No. 3 at Badami is a cave with a positive\r\ndate, A.D. 579, it may be well to give a plan and section (Woodcuts Nos.\r\n243 and 244) to illustrate its peculiarities, so as to enable a\r\ncomparison to be made between it and other examples. Its details will be\r\nfound fully illustrated in Mr. Burgess’s report.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 243. Plan of Cave No. 3, Badami. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nBurgess.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 244. Section of Cave No. 3, Badami. (From a Drawing by\r\nMr. Burgess.) Scale 25 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThough not one of the largest, it is still a fine cave, its verandah\r\nmeasuring 70 ft., with a depth of 50 ft., beyond which is a simple plain\r\ncell, containing the lingam. At one end of the verandah is the\r\nNarasingha Avatar; at the other end Vishnu seated on the five-headed\r\nserpent Ananta. The front pillars have each three brackets, of very\r\nwooden design, all of which are ornamented by two or three figures,\r\ngenerally a male and female, with a child or dwarf--all of considerable\r\nbeauty and delicacy of execution. The inner pillars are varied, and more\r\narchitectural in their forms, but in the best style of Hindu art.\r\n\r\nCompared with the style of art found at Amravati, on the opposite coast,\r\nit is curious to observe how nearly Buddha, seated on the many-headed\r\nNaga,[456] resembles Vishnu on Ananta in the last woodcut, and though\r\nthe religion is changed, the art has hardly altered to such an extent as\r\nmight be expected, considering that two centuries had probably elapsed\r\nbetween the execution of these two bas-reliefs. The change of religion,\r\nhowever, is complete, for though Buddha does appear at Badami, it is in\r\nthe very subordinate position of the ninth Avatar of Vishnu.[457]\r\n\r\nSometimes the Hindus successfully conquered one of the main difficulties\r\nof cave architecture by excavating them on the spur of a hill, as at\r\nthe Dhumnar Lena at Ellora, or by surrounding them by courts, as at\r\nElephanta; so that light was introduced on three sides instead of only\r\none, as was too often the case both with Buddhist and Hindu excavations.\r\nThese two, though probably among the last, are certainly the finest\r\nHindu excavations existing, if looked at from an architectural point of\r\nview. The Ellora example is the larger and finer, measuring 150 ft. each\r\nway (Woodcut No. 245). That at Elephanta, though extremely similar in\r\ngeneral arrangement, is less regular in plan, and also somewhat smaller,\r\nmeasuring only 130 ft. by 120 ft. It is easy to see that if these\r\ntemples stood in the open they would only be porches, like that at\r\nBaillûr (Woodcut No. 221), and numberless other examples, which are\r\nfound everywhere; but the necessities of rock-cut architecture required\r\nthat the cella should be placed inside the mantapa, or porch, instead of\r\nexternally to it, as was always the case in structural examples. This,\r\nperhaps, was hardly to be regretted; but it shows how little the\r\npractice of cutting temples in the rock was suited to the temple-forms\r\nof the Hindus, and we need not, therefore, feel surprised how readily\r\nthey abandoned it when any idea of rivalling the Buddhists had ceased to\r\nprompt their efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 245. Dhumnar Lena Cave at Ellora. (From Daniell’s ‘Views\r\nin Hindostan.’) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, there is only one example where the Indo-Aryan\r\narchitects attempted to rival the Dravidian in producing a monolithic\r\nexterior. It is at a place called Dhumnar, in Rajputana, where, as\r\nalready mentioned (_ante_, p. 162), there is an extensive series of late\r\nBuddhist excavations. In order to mark their triumph over that fallen\r\nfaith, the Hindus, apparently in the 8th century, drove an open cutting\r\ninto the side of the hill, till they came to a part high enough for\r\ntheir purpose. Here they enlarged this cutting into a pit 105 ft. by 70\r\nft., leaving a temple of very elegant architecture standing in the\r\ncentre, with seven small cells surrounding it, precisely as was done in\r\nthe case of the Kylas at Ellora. The effect, however, can hardly be said\r\nto be pleasing (Woodcut No. 246). A temple standing in a pit is always\r\nan anomaly, but in this instance it is valuable as an unaltered example\r\nof the style, and as showing how small shrines--which have too often\r\ndisappeared--were originally grouped round the greater shrines. The\r\nvalue of this characteristic we shall be better able to appreciate when\r\nwe come to describe the temples at Brambanam and other places in Java.\r\nWhen the Jains adopted the architecture of the Buddhists, they filled\r\ntheir residential cells with images, and made them into little temples,\r\nand the Hindus seem to some extent to have adopted the same practice as\r\nhere exemplified, but never carried it to the same extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 246. Rock-cut Temple at Dhumnar. (From a plan by Gen.\r\nCunningham.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 247. Saiva Temple near Poonah. (From a Sketch by\r\nDaniell.)]\r\n\r\nWith a sufficient number of examples, it would be easy to trace the rise\r\nand fall of this cellular system, and few things would be more\r\ninteresting; for now that we find it in full force in the Buddhist\r\nmonasteries at Gandhara (_ante_, p. 171), it would be most important to\r\nbe able to say exactly when the monk made way to the image. In India\r\nProper there is no instance of this being done in Buddhist times, or\r\nbefore A.D. 650, and hitherto we have been in the habit of considering\r\nit a purely Jaina arrangement. This must now be modified, but the\r\nquestion still remains--to what extent should this be done?\r\n\r\nOne more illustration must conclude what we have at present to say of\r\nHindu rock-cut temples. It is found near Poonah, and is very little\r\nknown, though much more appropriate to cave architecture than most\r\nexamples of its class. The temple itself is a simple pillared hall, with\r\napparently ten pillars in front, and probably had originally a\r\nstructural sikra built on the upper plateau to mark the position of the\r\nsanctuary. The most original part of it, however, is the Nundi pavilion,\r\nwhich stands in the courtyard in front of the temple (Woodcut No. 247).\r\nIt is circular in plan, and its roof--which is a great slab of rock--is\r\nsupported by, apparently, sixteen square pillars of very simple form.\r\nAltogether it is as appropriate a bit of design as is to be found in\r\nHindu cave architecture. It has, however, the defect only too common in\r\nthose Hindu excavations--that, being in a pit, it can be looked down\r\nupon; which is a test very few buildings can stand, and to which none\r\nought to be exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AND NORTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nTemples at Gualior, Khajurâho, Udaipur, Benares, Bindrabun, Kantonuggur,\r\nAmritsur.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certainly more than one hundred temples in Central and\r\nNorthern India which are well worthy of being described in detail, and,\r\nif described and illustrated, would convey a wonderful impression of the\r\nfertility in invention of the Hindu mind and of the elegance with which\r\nit was capable of expressing itself. None of these temples can make the\r\nsmallest pretension to rival the great southern examples in scale; they\r\nare all, indeed, smaller even than the greater of Orissan examples; and\r\nwhile some of them surpass the Orissan temples in elegance of form, many\r\nrival them in the profuse elaboration of minute ornamental details.\r\n\r\nNone of these temples--none, at least, that are now complete--seem to be\r\nof any great antiquity. At Erun, in the Saugor territory, are some\r\nfragments of columns, and several sculptures that seem to belong to the\r\nflourishing age of the Guptas, say about A.D. 450; and in the Mokundra\r\nPass there are the remains of a choultrie that may be as old, or older,\r\nbut it is a mere fragment,[458] and has no inscription upon it.\r\n\r\nAmong the more complete examples, the oldest I know of, and consequently\r\nthe most beautiful, is the porch or temple at Chandravati, near Jahra\r\nPuttun, in Rajputana. In its neighbourhood Colonel Tod found an\r\ninscription, dated A.D. 691,[459] which at one time I thought might have\r\nbeen taken from this temple, and consequently might give its date, which\r\nwould fairly agree with the style,[460] judged from that of some of the\r\ncaves at Ellora, which it very much resembles. As recent discoveries,\r\nhowever, have forced us to carry their dates further back by at least a\r\ncentury, it is probable that this too must go back to about the year\r\n600, or thereabouts. Indeed, with the Chaöri in the Mokundra Pass, and\r\nthe pillars at Erun, this Chandravati fragment completes the list of all\r\nwe at present can feel sure of having been erected before the dark ages.\r\nThere may be others, and, if so, it would be well they were examined,\r\nfor this is certainly one of the most elegant specimens of architecture\r\nin India (Woodcut No. 248). It has not the poetry of arrangement of the\r\nJaina octagonal domes, but it approaches very nearly to them by the\r\nlarge square space in the centre, which was covered by the most\r\nelegantly designed and most exquisitely carved roof known to exist\r\nanywhere. Its arrangement is evidently borrowed from that of Buddhist\r\nviharas, and it differs from them in style because their interiors were\r\nalways plastered and painted; here, on the contrary, everything is\r\nhonestly carved in stone.[461]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 248. Temple at Chandravati.]\r\n\r\nLeaving these fragments, one of the oldest, and certainly one of the\r\nmost perfect, in Central India is the now desecrated temple at Barrolli,\r\nsituated in a wild and romantic spot, not far from the falls of the\r\nChumbul, whose distant roar in the still night is the only sound that\r\nbreaks the silence of the solitude around them. The principal temple,\r\nrepresented in the Woodcut No. 249, may probably be added to the list of\r\nbuildings enumerated above as erected before 750 A.D. It certainly is at\r\nleast a century more modern than that at Chandravati, and, pending a\r\nmore precise determination, may be ascribed to the 8th or 9th century,\r\nand is one of the few of that age now known which were originally\r\ndedicated to Siva. Its general outline is identical with that of the\r\ncontemporary Orissan\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 249. Temple at Barrolli. (From a Drawing by the Author.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 250. Plan of Temple at Barrolli. (From Drawings by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\ntemples. But instead of the astylar enclosed porch, or mantapa, it has a\r\npillared portico of great elegance, whose roof reaches half-way up the\r\ntemple, and is sculptured with a richness and complexity of design\r\nalmost unrivalled, even in those days of patient prodigality of labour.\r\nIt will be observed in the plan (Woodcut No. 250) that the dimensions\r\nare remarkably small, and the temple is barely 60 ft. high, so that its\r\nmerit consists entirely in its shape and proportions, and in the\r\nelegance and profusion of the ornament that covers it.\r\n\r\nIn front of the temple is a detached porch, here called a Chaöri, or\r\nnuptial hall (the same word, I believe, as Choultrie in the south), in\r\nwhich tradition records the marriage of a Huna (Hun) prince to a\r\nRajputni bride, for which purpose it is said to have been erected;[462]\r\nbut whether this is so or not, it is one of the finest examples of such\r\ndetached halls known in the north. We miss here the octagonal dome of\r\nthe Jains, which would have given elegance and relief to its ceiling,\r\nthough the variety in the spacing of the columns has been attained by a\r\ndifferent process. The dome was seldom if ever employed in Hindu\r\narchitecture, but they seem to have attempted to gain sufficient relief\r\nto their otherwise monotonous arrangement of columns by breaking up the\r\nexternal outline of the plan of the mantapa, and by ranging the aisles\r\ndiagonally across the building, instead of placing them parallel to the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThe other two temples here are somewhat taller and more pointed in their\r\nform, and are consequently either more modern in date, or if of the same\r\nage--which may possibly be the case--would bring the date of the whole\r\ngroup down to the 10th century, which, after all, may be their true\r\ndate, though I am at present inclined to think the more ancient date\r\nmore consistent with our present knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 251. Pillar in Barrolli. (From a Plate in Tod’s ‘Annals\r\nof Rajastan.’)]\r\n\r\nA little way from the great temple are two pillars, one of which is here\r\nrepresented (Woodcut No. 251). They evidently supported one of those\r\ntorans, or triumphal archways, which succeeded the gateways of the\r\nBuddhist topes, and form frequently a very pleasing adjunct to Hindu\r\ntemples. They are, however, frail edifices at best, and easily\r\noverthrown, wherever the bigotry of the Moslems came into play.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUALIOR.\r\n\r\nOne temple, existing in the fortress of Gualior, has been already\r\ndescribed under the title of the Jaina Temple (_ante_, p. 244), though\r\nwhether it is Jaina or Vaishnava is by no means easily determined. At\r\nthe same place there is another, bearing the not very dignified name of\r\nthe Teli ka Mandir, or Oilman’s Temple (Woodcut No. 252). It is a square\r\nof 60 ft. each way, with a portico on the east projecting about 11 ft.\r\nUnlike the other temples we have been describing, it does not terminate\r\nupwards in a pyramid, nor is it crowned by an amalaka, but in a ridge of\r\nabout 30 ft. in extent, which may originally have had three amalakas\r\nupon it. I cannot help believing that this form of temple was once more\r\ncommon than we now find it. There are several examples of it at\r\nMahavellipore (Woodcuts Nos. 181, 182), evidently copied from a form\r\ncommon among the Buddhists, and one very beautiful example is found at\r\nBhuvaneswar,[463] there called Kapila Devi, and dedicated to Siva. The\r\nTeli ka Mandir was originally dedicated to Vishnu, but afterwards\r\nconverted to the worship of Siva. There is no inscription or any\r\ntradition from which its date can be gathered, but on the whole I am\r\ninclined to place it in the 10th or 11th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nKHAJURÂHO.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the finest and most extensive group of temples\r\nbelonging to the northern or Indo-Aryan style of architecture is that\r\ngathered round the great temple at Bhuvaneswar. They are also the most\r\ninteresting historically, inasmuch as their dates extend through five or\r\nsix centuries, and they alone consequently enable us to bridge over the\r\ndark ages of Indian art. From its remote situation, Orissa seems to have\r\nescaped, to a great extent at least, from the troubles that agitated\r\nnorthern and western India during the 8th and 9th centuries; and though\r\nfrom this cause we can find nothing in Central India to fill up the gap\r\nbetween Chandravati and Gualior, in Orissa the series is complete, and,\r\nif properly examined and described, would afford a consecutive history\r\nof the style from say 500 to 1100 or 1200 A.D.\r\n\r\nNext in interest and extent to the Bhuvaneswar group is that at\r\nKhajurâho,[464] in Bundelcund, as before mentioned (p. 245). At\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Teli ka Mandir, Gualior. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nthis place there are now to be found some thirty important temples, all\r\nof which, with the exception of the Chaonsat Jogini and the Ganthai,\r\ndescribed when treating of Jaina architecture, are of the same or nearly\r\nthe same age. Nor is it difficult, from their style and from the\r\ninscriptions gathered by General Cunningham, to see what that age was.\r\nThe inscriptions range from A.D. 954 to A.D. 1001; and though it is not\r\nclear to what particular temple they apply, we shall not probably err\r\nmuch if we assign the whole twenty-eight temples he enumerates to the\r\ncentury beginning 950 and ending 1050, with a margin of a few years\r\neither way. What renders this group more than usually interesting is,\r\nthat the Khajurâho temples are nearly equally divided between the three\r\ngreat Indian religions: one-third being Jaina, one-third Vaishnava, and\r\nthe remainder Saiva; and all being contemporary, it conveys an\r\nimpression of toleration we were hardly prepared for after the struggles\r\nof the preceding centuries, though it might have been expected three\r\ncenturies earlier.\r\n\r\nA curious result of this toleration or community of feeling is, that the\r\narchitecture of all the three groups is so similar that, looking to it\r\nalone, no one could say to which of the three religions any particular\r\ntemple belonged. It is only when their sculptures are examined that\r\ntheir original destination becomes apparent, and even then there are\r\nanomalies which it is difficult to explain. A portion, for instance, of\r\nthe sculptures of the principal Saiva temple--the Kandarya Mahadeo--are\r\nof a grossly indecent character;[465] the only instance, so far as I\r\nknow, of anything of the sort being found in a Saiva temple, that bad\r\npre-eminence being reserved to temples belonging to the worshippers of\r\nVishnu. It is possible that it may originally have belonged to the\r\nlatter sect; but, taking all the circumstances into consideration, this\r\nis most unlikely, and the fact must be added to many others to prove how\r\nmixed together the various sects were even at that time, and how little\r\nantagonistic they then were to each other.\r\n\r\nThe general character of these temples may be gathered from the annexed\r\nrepresentation (Woodcut No. 253) of the principal Saiva temple, the\r\nKandarya Mahadeo. As will be seen from the plan (Woodcut No. 254), it is\r\n109 ft. in length, by 60 ft. in breadth over all, and externally is 116\r\nft. above the ground, and 88 ft. above its own floor. Its basement, or\r\nperpendicular part, is, like all the great temples here, surrounded by\r\nthree rows of sculptured figures. General Cunningham counted 872 statues\r\non and in this temple, ranging from 2½ ft. to 3 ft. in height, or\r\nabout half life-size, and they are mixed up with a profusion of\r\nvegetable forms and conventional details which defy description. The\r\nvimana, or tower, it will be observed, is built\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 253. Kandarya Mahadeo, Khajurâho. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nup of smaller repetitions of itself, which became at this age one of the\r\nfavourite modes of decoration, and afterwards an essential feature of\r\nthe style. Here it is managed with singular grace, giving great variety\r\nand play of light and shade, without unnecessarily breaking up the\r\noutline. The roof of the porch, as seen in front, is a little confused,\r\nbut as seen on the flank it rises pleasingly step by step till it abuts\r\nagainst the tower, every part of the internal arrangement being\r\nappropriately distinguished on the exterior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 254. Plan of Kandarya Mahadeo, Khajurâho. (From a Plan by\r\nGen. Cunningham.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare the design of the Jaina temple (Woodcut No. 136) with that\r\nof this building, we cannot but admit that the former is by far the most\r\nelegant, but on the other hand the richness and vigour of the Mahadeo\r\ntemple redeem its want of elegance and fascinates in spite of its\r\nsomewhat confused outline. The Jaina temple is the legitimate outcrop of\r\nthe class of temples that originated in the Great Temple at Bhuvaneswar,\r\nwhile the Kandarya Mahadeo exhibits a complete development of that style\r\nof decoration which resulted in continued repetition of itself on a\r\nsmaller scale to make up a complete whole. Both systems have their\r\nadvantages, but on the whole the simpler seems to be preferable to the\r\nmore complicated mode of design.\r\n\r\n\r\nUDAIPUR.\r\n\r\nThe examples already given will perhaps have sufficed to render the\r\ngeneral form of the Indo-Aryan temple familiar to the reader, but as no\r\ntwo are quite like one another, their variety is infinite. There is one\r\nform, however, which became very fashionable about the 11th century, and\r\nis so characteristic that it deserves to be illustrated. Fortunately a\r\nvery perfect example exists at a place called Udaipur, near Bhilsa, in\r\nthe Bhopal territory.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the Woodcut (No. 255) the porch is covered with a\r\nlow pyramidal roof, placed diagonally on the substructure, and rising in\r\nsteps, each of which is ornamented with vases or urns of varying shapes.\r\nThe tower is ornamented by four flat bands, of great beauty and elegance\r\nof design, between each of which are thirty-five little repetitions of\r\nitself, placed one above the other in five tiers, the whole surmounted\r\nby an amalaka, and an urn of very elegant design. As every part of this\r\nis carved with great precision and delicacy, and as the whole is quite\r\nperfect at the present day, there are few temples of its class which\r\ngive a better idea of the style than this one. Fortunately, too, its\r\ndate is perfectly well known. From an inscription copied by Lieutenant\r\nBurt, it appears it was erected by a king who was reigning at Malwa, in\r\nthe year 1060 of our era.[466]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 255. Temple at Udaipur.]\r\n\r\nAt Kallian, in Bombay harbour, there is a temple called Ambernath, very\r\nsimilar to this, on making drawings and casts from which the Bombay\r\ngovernment has lately spent a good deal of money.[467] It is, however,\r\nin a very ruinous state, and even when perfect could never have been\r\nequal to this one at Udaipur, and to many others on which the money\r\nmight have been better laid out. In it there is a slab with an\r\ninscription, dated in the Saka year 782, or A.D. 860.[468] It is not\r\nquite clear, however, whether this inscription belongs to the temple\r\nwhich we now see, or to an earlier one, fragments of which are found\r\nbuilt into the vimana of the present one. If the date of the temple is\r\nthat just quoted, as Dr. Bhau Daji would have us believe, all that can\r\nbe said is that it is utterly anomalous. If it is in A.D. 1070, as\r\nanother inscription he quotes found near the place might lead us to\r\ninfer,[469] it accords with all else we know of the style.\r\n\r\nOne other illustration must complete what we now have to say regarding\r\nthese Indo-Aryan temples. It is one of the most modern of the style,\r\nhaving been erected by Meera Baie, the wife of Khumbo Rana of Chittore\r\n(A.D. 1418-1468). Khumbo was, as is well known, devoted to the Jaina\r\nfaith, having erected the temple at Sadri (Woodcut No. 133), and the\r\nPillar of Victory (Woodcut No. 143); yet here we find him and his wife\r\nerecting in their capital two temples dedicated to Vishnu. The king’s\r\ntemple, which is close by, is very much smaller than this one, for which\r\nhis wife gets credit. In plan, the only peculiarity is that the\r\npradakshina, or procession-path round the cell, is here an open\r\ncolonnade, with four little pavilions at the four corners, and this is\r\nrepeated in the portico in the manner shown in the annexed diagram\r\n(Woodcut No. 256).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 256. Diagram explanatory of the Plan of Meera Baie’s\r\nTemple, Chittore. No scale.]\r\n\r\nThe roof of the portico, in the form of a pyramid, is placed diagonally\r\nas at Udaipur, while the tower itself is of so solid and unbroken an\r\noutline, that it might at first sight be ascribed to a much earlier date\r\nthan the 15th century (Woodcut No. 257). When, however, it is closely\r\nlooked at, we miss the frequent amalaka bands and other ornamental\r\nfeatures of earlier times, and the crowning members are more unlike\r\nthose of ancient temples. The curve, too, of its outline is regular from\r\nbase to summit, and consequently feebler than that of the older\r\nexamples; but taking it all in all, it certainly is more like an ancient\r\ntemple than any other of its age I am acquainted with. It was a revival,\r\nthe last expiring effort of a style that was dying out, in that form at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 257. Temple of Vriji, Chittore. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVISHVESHWAR, BENARES.\r\n\r\nIf you ask a Brahman of Benares to point out to you the most ancient\r\ntemple of his city, he inevitably leads you to the Vishveshwar, as not\r\nonly the most holy, but the oldest of its sacred edifices. Yet it is\r\nknown, and cannot be disputed, that the temple, as it now stands, was\r\nerected from the foundation in the last century, to replace one that had\r\nbeen thrown down and desecrated by the bigot Aurungzebe. This he did in\r\norder that he might erect on the most venerated spot of the Hindus his\r\nmosque, whose tall minarets still rear their heads in insult over all\r\nthe Hindu buildings of the city. The strange thing is, that in this\r\nassertion the Brahmans are not so very\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 258. Temple of Vishveshwar. (From Prinsep’s ‘Views in\r\nBenares.’) No scale.]\r\n\r\nfar from representing the true state of the case. There is hardly any\r\ngreat city in Hindustan that can show so few evidences of antiquity as\r\nBenares. The Buddhist remains at Sarnath hardly can be said to belong to\r\nthe city, and even there they are, as above explained, the most modern\r\nexamples of their class in India. The fact is, that the oldest buildings\r\nin the city are the Moslem tombs and buildings about the Bukariya Kund,\r\nand they almost certainly belong to the 15th century. Even the temple of\r\nVishveshwar, which Aurungzebe destroyed, was not erected before the\r\nreign of his predecessor Akbar. The style is so nearly identical with\r\nthat of known buildings of his reign, at Muttra and elsewhere, that\r\nthere can be no doubt on this head. When desecrated it was the\r\nprincipal, and probably the most splendid, edifice of its class in the\r\ncity. It may be, and probably is true, that the Vedic Brahmans erected\r\ntheir fire altars, and worshipped the sun, and paid adoration to the\r\nelements on this spot 4000 years ago. It may be also that the emblem of\r\nSiva has attracted admiring crowds to this spot for the last 1000 years;\r\nbut there is no material evidence that before the time of Akbar (A.D.\r\n1556-1605) any important permanent building was ever erected there to\r\ndignify the locality.\r\n\r\nThe present temple is a double one: two towers or spires almost exactly\r\nduplicates of each other. One of these is represented in the preceding\r\nwoodcut (No. 258), and they are connected by a porch, crowned by a dome\r\nborrowed from the Mahomedan style, which, though graceful and pleasing\r\nin design, hardly harmonises with the architecture of the rest of the\r\ntemple. The spires are each 51 ft. in height, and covered with ornament\r\nto an extent quite sufficient even in this style. The details too are\r\nall elegant, and sharply and cleanly cut, and without any evidence of\r\nvulgarity or bad taste; but they are feeble as compared with the more\r\nancient examples, and the forms of the pyramidal parts have lost that\r\nexpression of power and of constructive propriety which were so evident\r\nin the earlier stages of the art. It is, however, curiously\r\ncharacteristic of the style and place, that a building, barely 50 ft. in\r\nlength, and the same in height, should be the principal temple in the\r\nmost sacred city of the Hindus, and equally so that one hardly 150 years\r\nold should be considered as the most ancient, while it is only that\r\nwhich marks this most holy spot in the religious cosmogony of the\r\nHindus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE OF SCINDIAH’S MOTHER, GUALIOR.\r\n\r\nOne more example must suffice to explain the ultimate form which the\r\nancient towers of the Orissan temples have reached in the present\r\ncentury. It is just finished, having been erected by the mother of the\r\npresent reigning Maharajah of Gualior, and to it has been added a tomb\r\nor cenotaph either by herself or her son. As will be seen from the\r\nwoodcut (No. 259) it is elegant, though feeble as compared with ancient\r\nexamples. The Mahomedan dome appears in the background, and the curved\r\nBengali roof in the pavilion in front. The most striking peculiarity of\r\nthe style is, that the sikras have nearly lost the graceful curved form,\r\nwhich is the most marked peculiarity of all the ancient examples. As has\r\nalready been remarked, the straight-lined pyramid first appears in the\r\nTakht-i-Suleiman’s temple in Kashmir, where its introduction was\r\nprobably hastened by the wooden straight-lined roofs of the original\r\nnative style. It is equally evident, however, in a temple which Cheyt\r\nSing, the Raja of Benares, erected at Ramnugger in the end of the last\r\nor beginning of the present century. Since that time the tendency has\r\nbeen more and more in that direction, and if not checked, the\r\nprobability is that the curve will be entirely lost before the century\r\nis out. To an European eye, accustomed only to our straight-lined\r\nspires, that may seem hardly a matter for regret; but to any one\r\neducated in Eastern forms it can scarcely appear doubtful that these\r\nspires will lose half their charm if deprived of the graceful curved\r\noutline they have so long retained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 259. Temple of Scindiah’s Mother, Gualior. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBINDRABUN.\r\n\r\nIn order not to interrupt the story of the gradual development of the\r\nstyle, the history has been brought down to the present day in as nearly\r\na consecutive manner as possible, thus anticipating the dates of several\r\ntemples. It seems expedient, however, in any history that this should be\r\ndone, for few things of its class are more interesting than to trace the\r\nprogressive changes by which the robust form of the Parasurameswara\r\ntemple at Bhuvaneswar, or of the great temple there, became changed into\r\nthe feeble elegance of the Vishveshwar or Gualior temples. The few\r\nexamples that can be adduced in such a work as this may not suffice to\r\nmake this so clear to others as it is to myself. With twenty or thirty\r\nexamples it could be made self-evident, and that may one day be done,\r\nand this curious chapter in architectural history be thus added to the\r\nestablished sequences which every true style of art affords. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, it is necessary to go back a little to mention one or two\r\naberrant types which still are not without interest.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, it does not appear proven that the Moslems did\r\nwantonly throw down the temples of the Hindus, except when they wanted\r\nthe materials for the erection of mosques or other buildings. But,\r\nwhether this was so or not, it is evident that the first three centuries\r\nof Mahomedan rule in India were singularly unfavourable for the\r\ndevelopment of Hindu art in any part of the country where their rule was\r\nfirmly established. With the tolerant reign of Akbar, however, a new\r\nstate of affairs was inaugurated. Not only was he himself entirely\r\ndevoid of religious bigotry, but most--or at least the most eminent--of\r\nhis ministers and friends were Hindus, and he lent an attentive ear to\r\nthe Christian missionaries who frequented his court. But, besides its\r\ntolerance, his reign was marked by a degree of prosperity and\r\nmagnificence till then unknown during that of any other Indian sovereign\r\nof his faith. Not only are his own buildings unrivalled in their extent\r\nand magnificence, but he encouraged all those around him to follow his\r\nexample, and found, among others, a most apt imitator in the celebrated\r\nMan Singh of Ambêr, afterwards of Jeypore, who reigned A.D. 1592-1615.\r\nHe erected at Bindrabun a temple, which either he left unfinished at his\r\ndeath, or the sikra of which may have been thrown down by Aurungzebe. It\r\nis one of the most interesting and elegant temples in India, and the\r\nonly one, perhaps, from which an European architect might borrow a few\r\nhints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 260. Plan of Temple at Bindrabun. (By the Author.) Scale\r\n100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe temple, as it now stands, consists of a cruciform porch, internally\r\nnearly quite perfect, though externally it is not clear how it was\r\nintended to be finished (Woodcuts Nos. 260, 261). The cell, too, is\r\nperfect internally--used for worship--but the sikra is gone; possibly it\r\nmay never have been completed. Though not large, its dimensions are\r\nrespectable, the porch measuring 117 ft. east and west, by 105 ft. north\r\nand south, and is covered by a true vault, built with radiating\r\narches--the only instance, except one, known to exist in a Hindu temple\r\nin the north of India. Over the four arms of the cross the vault is\r\nplain, and only 20 ft. span, but in the centre it expands to 35 ft., and\r\nis quite equal in design to the best Gothic vaulting known. It is the\r\nexternal design of this temple, however, which is most remarkable. The\r\nangles are accentuated with singular force and decision, and the\r\nopenings, which are more than sufficient for that climate, are\r\npicturesquely arranged and pleasingly divided. It is, however, the\r\ncombination of vertical with horizontal lines, covering the whole\r\nsurface, that forms the great merit of the design. This is, indeed, not\r\npeculiar to this temple; but at Bhuvaneswar, Hullabîd, and elsewhere,\r\nthe whole surface is so overloaded with ornament as to verge on bad\r\ntaste. Here the accentuation is equal, but the surfaces are\r\ncomparatively plain, and the effect dependent on the elegance of the\r\nprofile of the mouldings rather than on the extent of the ornamentation.\r\nWithout elaborate drawings, it would be difficult to convey a correct\r\nimpression of this; but the annexed view (Woodcut No. 262) of a balcony,\r\nwith its accompaniments, will suffice to illustrate what is meant. The\r\nfigures might as well be omitted: being carved where Moslem influences\r\nhad long been strong, they are the weakest part of the design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 261. View of Temple at Bindrabun. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe other vaulted temple, just alluded to, is at Goverdhun, not far off,\r\nand built under the same tolerant influence during the reign of Akbar.\r\nIt is a plain edifice 135 ft. long by 35 ft. in width externally, and\r\nboth in plan and design singularly like those early Romance churches\r\nthat are constantly met with in the south of France, belonging to the\r\n11th and 12th centuries. If, indeed, the details are not too closely\r\nlooked into, it might almost pass muster for an example of Christian art\r\nat that age,[470] while except in scale the plan of the porch at\r\nBindrabun bears a most striking resemblance to that of St. Front at\r\nPerigeux (Woodcut No. 328, vol. i.). The similarity is accidental, of\r\ncourse; but it is curious that architects so distant in time and place\r\nshould hit so nearly on the same devices to obtain certain desired\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 262. Balcony in Temple at Bindrabun. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nKANTONUGGUR.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the great Indo-Aryan style of temple-building described\r\nabove, there are a number of small aberrant types which it might be\r\nexpedient to describe in a more extensive work; but, except one, none of\r\nthem seem of sufficient importance to require illustration in a work\r\nlike the present. The exceptional style is that which grew up in Bengal\r\nproper on the relaxation of the Mahomedan severity of religious\r\nintolerance, and is practised generally in the province at the present\r\nday. It may have existed earlier, but no examples are known, and it is\r\nconsequently impossible to feel sure about this. Its leading\r\ncharacteristic is the bent cornice, copied from the bambu huts of the\r\nnatives. To understand this, it may be as well to explain that the roofs\r\nof all the huts in Bengal are formed of two rectangular frames of\r\nbambus, perfectly flat and rectangular when formed, but when lifted from\r\nthe ground and fitted to the substructure they are bent so that the\r\nelasticity of the bambu, resisting the flexure, keeps all the fastenings\r\nin a state of tension, which makes a singularly firm roof out of very\r\nfrail materials. It is the only instance I know of elasticity being\r\nemployed in building, but is so singularly successful in attaining the\r\ndesired end, and is so common, that we can hardly wonder when the\r\nBengalis turned their attention to more permanent modes of building they\r\nshould have copied this one. It is nearly certain that it was employed\r\nfor the same purposes before the Mahomedan sovereignty, as it is found\r\nin all the mosques at Gaur and Malda; but we do not know of its use in\r\nHindu temples till afterwards, though now it is extremely common all\r\nover northern India.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of a temple in this style is that at\r\nKantonuggur, twelve miles from the station at Dinajepore. It was\r\ncommenced in A.D. 1704 and finished in 1722.[471] As will be seen from\r\nthe annexed illustration (Woodcut No. 263), it is a nine-towered temple,\r\nof considerable dimensions, and of a pleasingly picturesque design. The\r\ncentre pavilion is square, and, but for its pointed form, shows clearly\r\nenough its descent from the Orissan prototypes; the other eight are\r\noctagonal, and must, I fancy, be derived from Mahomedan originals. The\r\npointed arches that prevail throughout are certainly borrowed from that\r\nstyle, but the building being in brick their employment was inevitable.\r\n\r\nNo stone is used in the building, and the whole surface is covered with\r\ndesigns in terra-cotta, partly conventional, and these are frequently\r\nrepeated, as they may be without offence to taste; but the bulk of them\r\nare figure-subjects, which do not ever seem to be repeated, and form a\r\nperfect repository of the manners, customs, and costumes of the people\r\nof Bengal at the beginning of the last century. In execution they\r\ndisplay an immeasurable inferiority to the carvings on the old temples\r\nin Orissa or the Mysore, but for general effect of richness and\r\nprodigality of labour this temple may fairly be allowed to compete with\r\nsome of the earlier examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 263. Temple at Kantonuggur. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThere is another and more ornate temple, in the same style, at Gopal\r\nGunge,[472] in the same district, but in infinitely worse taste; and\r\none known as the Black Pagoda, at Calcutta, and many others all through\r\nLower Bengal; but hardly any so well worthy of illustration as this one\r\nat Kantonuggur.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMRITSUR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 264. The Golden Temple in the Holy Tank at Amritsur.]\r\n\r\nOne other example may serve for the present to complete what we have at\r\npresent to say regarding the temples of modern India. This time,\r\nhowever, it is no longer an idol-shrine, but a monotheistic place of\r\nprayer, and differs, consequently, most essentially from those we have\r\nbeen describing. The religion of the Sîkhs appears to have been a\r\nprotest alike against the gross idolatry of the Hindus and the\r\ninflexible monotheism of the Moslems. It does not, however, seem that\r\ntemples or gorgeous ceremonial formed any part of the religious system\r\npropounded by its founders. Reading the ‘Granth’ and prayer are what\r\nwere insisted upon, but even then not necessarily in public. We, in\r\nconsequence, know nothing of their temples, if they have any; but\r\nRunjeet Singh was too emulous of the wealth of his Hindu and Moslem\r\nsubjects in this respect not to desire to rival their magnificence, and\r\nconsequently we have the Golden Temple in the Holy Tank at Amritsur--as\r\nsplendid an example of its class as can be found in India, though\r\nneither its outline nor its details can be commended (Woodcut No. 264).\r\nIt is useful, however, as exemplifying one of the forms which Indian\r\ntemple-architecture assumed in the 19th century, and where, for the\r\npresent, we must leave it. The Jains and Hindus may yet do great things\r\nin it, if they can escape the influence of European imitation; but now\r\nthat the sovereignty has passed from the Sîkhs we cannot expect their\r\npriests or people to indulge in a magnificence their religion does not\r\ncountenance or encourage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCIVIL ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCenotaphs--Palaces at Gualior, Ambêr, Deeg--Ghâts--Reservoirs--Dams.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENOTAPHS.\r\n\r\nAs remarked above, one of the most unexpected peculiarities of the art,\r\nas practised by the inhabitants of southern India, is the absence of any\r\nattempt at sepulchral magnificence. As the Dravidians were undoubtedly\r\nof Turanian origin, and were essentially builders, we certainly would\r\nexpect that they should show some respect for the memories of their\r\ngreat men. It is, however, even uncertain how far the cromlechs,\r\ndolmens, or sepulchral circles found all over the south of India can be\r\nsaid to belong to the Dravidians in a ruder stage of society, or whether\r\nthey belong to some aboriginal tribes who may have adopted the language\r\nof the superior races without being able to change the instincts of\r\ntheir race. Even after they had seen how much respect the Mahomedans\r\npaid to departed greatness, they failed to imitate them in this\r\npeculiarity. It was otherwise in the north of India--not among the pure\r\nAryans, of course; but in the Rajput states, where blood is less pure,\r\nthey eagerly seized the suggestion offered by Mahomedan magnificence in\r\nthis respect, and erected chuttries on the spots where their bodies had\r\nbeen burnt. Where, too, their widows, with that strange devotion which\r\nis the noblest trait in the Hindu female’s character, had sacrificed\r\nthemselves to what they conceived to be their duty.\r\n\r\nIn Rajputana every native capital has its Maha Sâti, or place where the\r\nsovereigns of the state and their nearest relatives are buried with\r\ntheir wives. Most of these are appropriately situated in a secluded spot\r\nat some little distance from the town, and, the locality being generally\r\nchosen because it is rocky and well-wooded, it forms as picturesque a\r\nnecropolis as is to be found anywhere. Of these, however, the most\r\nmagnificent, and certainly among the most picturesque, is that of\r\nOudeypore, the capital of Mewar and the chief of all the Rajput states\r\nstill existing. Here the tombs exist literally in hundreds, of all\r\nsizes, from the little domical canopy supported by\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 265. Cenotaph of Singram Sing at Oudeypore. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nfour columns to the splendid chuttry whose octagonal dome is supported\r\nby fifty-six, for it has been the burying-place of the race ever since\r\nthey were expelled from the ancient capital at Chittore by Akbar in\r\n1580. All are crowned by domes, and all make more or less pretensions to\r\narchitectural beauty; while as they are grouped together as accident\r\ndictated, and interspersed with noble trees, it would be difficult to\r\npoint out a more beautiful cemetery anywhere. Among the finest is that\r\nof Singram Sing, one of the most illustrious of his race, who was buried\r\non this spot, with twenty-one of his wives, in A.D. 1733. As will be\r\nseen from the annexed Woodcut (No. 265), it is a fifty-six pillared\r\nportico, with one octagonal dome in the centre (_vide ante_, Woodcut No.\r\n119). The dome itself is supported on eight dwarf pillars, which,\r\nhowever, hardly seem sufficient for the purpose. The architect seems to\r\nhave desired to avoid all appearances of that gloom or solemnity which\r\ncharacterise the contemporary tombs of the Moslems, but, in doing this,\r\nto have erred in the other direction. The base here is certainly not\r\nsufficiently solid for the mass it has to support; but the whole is so\r\nelegant, and the effect so pleasing, that it seems hypercritical to find\r\nfault with it, and difficult to find, even among Mahomedan tombs,\r\nanything more beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 266. Cenotaph in Maha Sâti at Oudeypore. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nHe it was, apparently, who erected the cenotaph to the memory of his\r\npredecessor Amera Sing II., for the Hindus do not appear to have gone so\r\nfar in their imitation of the Moslems as to erect their own tombs. In\r\nstyle it is very similar to that last described, except that it\r\npossesses only thirty-two columns instead of fifty-six. It has, however,\r\nthe same lofty stylobate, which adds so much to the effect of these\r\ntombs, but has also the same defect--that the dome is raised on eight\r\ndwarf columns, which do not seem sufficient for the purpose.[473]\r\n\r\nWoodcut No. 266 represents a cenotaph in this cemetery with only twelve\r\ncolumns, which, _mutatis mutandis_, is identical with the celebrated\r\ntomb at Halicarnassus.[474] The lofty stylobate, the twelve columns, the\r\noctagonal dome, and the general mode of construction are the same; but\r\nthe twelve or thirteen centuries that have elapsed between the\r\nconstruction of the two, and the difference of locality, have so altered\r\nthe details that the likeness is not at first sight easily recognisable.\r\nFrom the form of its dome it is evidently considerably more modern than\r\nthat last described; it may, indeed, have been erected within the limits\r\nof the present century.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the same woodcut is another cenotaph with only eight\r\npillars, but the effect is so weak and unpleasing that it is hardly to\r\nbe wondered at that the arrangement is so rare. The angle columns seem\r\nindispensable to give the design that accentuation and firmness which\r\nare indispensable in all good architecture.\r\n\r\nThese last two illustrations, it will be observed, are practically in\r\nthe Jaina style of architecture; for, though adopting a Mahomedan form,\r\nthe Ranas of Oudeypore clung to the style of architecture which their\r\nancestors had practised, and which Khumbo Rana had only recently\r\nrendered so famous. This gives them a look of greater antiquity than\r\nthey are entitled to, for it is quite certain that Oudeypore was not the\r\ncapital of the kingdom before the sack of Chittore in 1580; and nearly\r\nequally so that the Hindus never thought of this mode of commemorating\r\ntheir dead till the tolerant reign of Akbar. He did more than all that\r\nhad been done before or since to fuse together the antagonistic feelings\r\nof the two religions into at least a superficial similarity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFurther north, where the Jaina style never had been used to the same\r\nextent at least as in the south-west, the Hindus adopted quite a\r\ndifferent style in their palaces and cenotaphs. It was much more of an\r\narched style, and though never, so far as I know, using a true arch,\r\nthey adopted the form of the foliated arch, which is so common in the\r\npalaces of Agra and Delhi, and all the Mogul buildings. In the palace at\r\nDeeg, and in the cenotaphs of Goverdhun, this style is seen in great\r\nperfection. It is well illustrated, with all its peculiarities, in the\r\nnext view of the tomb of Baktawar Sing at Ulwar,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 267. Tomb of Rajah Baktawar at Ulwar. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nerected within the limits of the present century (Woodcut No. 267). To a\r\nEuropean eye, perhaps the least pleasing part will be the Bengali curved\r\ncornices alluded to in the last chapter; but to any one familiar with\r\nthe style, its employment gets over many difficulties that a straight\r\nline could hardly meet, and altogether it makes up with its domes and\r\npavilions as pleasing a group of its class as is to be found in India,\r\nof its age at least. The tombs of the Bhurtpore Rajahs at Goverdhun are\r\nsimilar to this one, but on a larger scale, and some of them being\r\nolder, are in better taste; but the more modern ones avoid most of the\r\nfaults that are only too characteristic of the art in India at the\r\npresent day, and some of them are very modern. One was in course of\r\nconstruction when I was there in 1839, and from its architect I learned\r\nmore of the secrets of art as practised in the Middle Ages than I have\r\nlearned from all the books I have since read. Another was commenced\r\nafter the time of my visit, and it is far from being one of the worst\r\nbuildings of its class. If one could only inspire the natives with a\r\nfeeling of pride in their own style, there seems little doubt that even\r\nnow they could rival the works of their forefathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALACES.\r\n\r\nAnother feature by which the northern style is most pleasingly\r\ndistinguished from the southern, is the number and beauty of the\r\npalaces, which are found in all the capitals of the native states,\r\nespecially in Rajputana. These are seldom designed with much reference\r\nto architectural symmetry or effect, but are nevertheless always\r\npicturesque and generally most ornamental objects in the landscape where\r\nthey are found. As a rule, they are situated on rocky eminences, jutting\r\ninto or overhanging lakes or artificial pieces of water, which are\r\nalways pleasing accompaniments to buildings of any sort in that climate;\r\nand the way they are fitted into the rocks, or seem to grow out of them,\r\nfrequently leads to the most picturesque combinations. Sometimes their\r\nbases are fortified with round towers or bastions, on whose terraces the\r\npalace stands; and even when this is not the case, the basement is\r\ngenerally built up solid to a considerable height, in a manner that\r\ngives a most pleasing effect of solidity to the whole, however light the\r\nsuperstructure may be, and often is. If to these natural advantages you\r\nadd the fact that the high caste Hindu is almost incapable of bad taste,\r\nand that all these palaces are exactly what they profess to be, without\r\nany affectation of pretending to be what they are not, or of copying any\r\nstyle, ancient or modern, but that best suited for their purposes--it\r\nwill not be difficult to realise what pleasing objects of study these\r\nRajput palaces really are. At the same time it will be easily understood\r\nhow difficult it must be in such a work as this to convey any adequate\r\nidea of their beauty; without plans explaining their arrangements, and\r\narchitectural details of their interior, neither their elegance nor\r\nappropriateness can be judged of. A palace is not like a temple--a\r\nsimple edifice of one or two halls or cells, almost identical with\r\nhundreds of others; but a vast congeries of public and private\r\napartments grouped as a whole more for convenience than effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew of the palaces of India have escaped the fate of that class of\r\nedifice all the world over. Either they must be deserted and left to\r\ndecay, which in India means rapid obliteration, or they must be altered\r\nand modified to suit the requirements of subsequent occupants, till\r\nlittle if anything remains of the original structure. This fate, so far\r\nas is known, has overtaken all the royal abodes that may have existed\r\nbefore the dark ages; so much so, indeed, that no trace of them has been\r\nfound anywhere. Even after that we look in vain for anything important\r\nbefore the 13th century. At Chittore, for instance, where one of the\r\nearliest Rajput dynasties was established, there are buildings that bear\r\nthe name of the Palace of the Mori, but so altered and remodelled as to\r\nbe unrecognisable as such; nor can the palace of the Khengar at Girnar\r\nexhibit any feature that belongs to the date to which it is assigned.\r\n\r\nAt Chittore the oldest building of this class which can with certainty\r\nbe said to have existed anterior to the sack of the place by Alla-u-dîn\r\nin 1305, is the palace of Bhîm and Pudmandi, which remains unaltered,\r\nand is, though small, a very pleasing example of the style.[475] The\r\npalace of Khumbo Rana (A.D. 1418-1468) in the same place is far more\r\ngrandiose, and shows all that beauty of detail which characterises his\r\nbuildings in general.\r\n\r\nThe palaces at Chittore belonging to this dynasty were however far\r\nsurpassed, in extent at least, by those which Udya Sing commenced at\r\nUdyapur or Oudeypore, to which place he removed his capital after the\r\nthird sack of Chittore by Akbar in 1580. It has not unfrequently been\r\ncompared with the Castle at Windsor, and not inaptly, for both in\r\noutline and extent it is not unlike that palace, though differing so\r\nwonderfully in detail and in situation. In this latter respect the\r\nEastern has the advantage of the Western palace, as it stands on the\r\nverge of an extensive lake, surrounded by hills of great beauty of\r\noutline, and in the lake are two island palaces, the Jug Newas and Jug\r\nMundir, which are more beautiful in their class than any similar objects\r\nI know of elsewhere.[476] It would be difficult to find any scene where\r\nart and nature are so happily blended together and produce so fairy-like\r\nan effect. Certainly nothing I know of so modern a date equals it.\r\n\r\nThe palace at Boondi is of about the same modern age as that at\r\nOudeypore, and almost equals it in architectural effect. It is smaller\r\nhowever, and its lake is less in extent, and has only temples standing\r\non its islets, instead of palaces with their pavilions and gardens.\r\nStill, the mode in which it is placed on its hill, and the way in which\r\nits buildings gradually fade into the bastions of the hill above, are\r\nsingularly picturesque even for this country, and the hills being\r\nhigher, and the valleys narrower, the effect of this palace is in some\r\nrespects even more imposing than that at Oudeypore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 268. Palace at Duttiah. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some twenty or thirty similar royal residences in\r\nCentral India, all of which have points of interest and beauty: some for\r\ntheir extent, others for their locality, and some for their beauty in\r\ndetail, but every one of which would require a volume to describe in\r\ndetail. Two examples, though among the least known, must at present\r\nsuffice to illustrate their general appearance.\r\n\r\nThat at Duttiah (Woodcut No. 268), in Bundelcund, is a large square\r\nblock of building, more regular than such buildings generally are, but\r\nstill sufficiently relieved both in outline, and in the variety of\r\ndetail applied to the various storeys, to avoid monotony, and with its\r\ngardens leading down to the lake, and its tombs opposite, combine to\r\nmake up an architectural scene of a singularly pleasing character.\r\n\r\nThe other is even less known, as it belongs to the little Bundelcund\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 269. Palace at Ourtcha Bundelcund. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nstate of Ourtcha (Woodcut No. 269), but is of a much more varied outline\r\nthan that at Duttiah, and with its domes and gateways makes up as\r\npicturesque a combination as can well be found anywhere. It is too\r\nmodern for much purity of detail, but that in a residence is less\r\nobjectionable than it would be in a temple, or in an edifice devoted to\r\nany higher purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUALIOR.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most historically interesting of these Central Indian\r\npalaces is that of Gualior. The rock on which that fortress stands is of\r\nso peculiar a formation, and by nature so strong, that it must always\r\nhave been occupied by the chiefs of the state in which it is situated.\r\nIts temples have already been described, but its older palaces have\r\nundergone the fate of all similar edifices; it, however, possesses, or\r\npossessed, in that built by Mân Sing (A.D. 1486-1516), the most\r\nremarkable and interesting example of a Hindu palace of an early age in\r\nIndia. The external dimensions of this palace are 300 ft. by 160 ft.,\r\nand on the east side it is 100 ft. high, having two underground storeys\r\nlooking over the country. On all its faces the flat surface is relieved\r\nby tall towers of singularly pleasing design, crowned by cupolas that\r\nwere covered with domes of gilt copper when Baber saw them in 1527.[477]\r\nHis successor, Vicramaditya, added another palace, of even greater\r\nextent, to this one in 1516;[478] and Jehangir and Shah Jehan added\r\npalaces to these two, the whole making up a group of edifices unequalled\r\nfor picturesqueness and interest by anything of their class that exists\r\nin Central India.[479] Among the apartments in the palace was one called\r\nthe Baradurri, supported on twelve columns, and 45 ft. square, with a\r\nstone roof, which was one of the most beautiful apartments of its class\r\nanywhere to be found. It was, besides, singularly interesting from the\r\nexpedients to which the Hindu architect was forced to resort to imitate\r\nthe vaults of the Moslems. They had not then learned to copy them, as\r\nthey did at the end of that century, at Bindrabun and elsewhere, under\r\nthe guidance of the tolerant Akbar.\r\n\r\nOf these buildings, which so excited the admiration of the Emperor\r\nBaber, probably little now remains. The Moslems added to the palaces of\r\nthe Hindus, and spared their temples and the statues of the Jains. We\r\nhave ruthlessly set to work to destroy whatever interferes with our\r\nconvenience, and during the few years we have occupied the fort, have\r\nprobably done more to disfigure its beauties, and obliterate its\r\nmemories, than was caused by the Moslems during the centuries they\r\npossessed or occupied it. Better things were at one time hoped for, but\r\nthe fact seems to be, the ruling powers have no real heart in the\r\nmatter, and subordinates are allowed to do as they please, and if they\r\ncan save money or themselves trouble, there is nothing in India that can\r\nescape the effect of their unsympathising ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBÊR.\r\n\r\nThe palace at Ambêr, the original capital of the Jeypore states, ranks\r\nnext after that of Gualior as an architectural object among the Rajput\r\npalaces. It is, however, a century more modern, having been commenced by\r\nanother Mân Singh, who ascended the throne in 1592, and was completed by\r\nSiwai Jey Sing, who added the beautiful gateway which bears his name\r\nbefore he removed the seat of government to Jeypore in 1728. In\r\nconsequence of this more modern date it has not that stamp of Hindu\r\noriginality that is so characteristic of the Gualior example, and\r\nthroughout it bears a strong impress of that influence which Akbar’s\r\nmind and works stamped on everything that was done in India during his\r\nreign. Its situation, too, is inferior to that of Gualior for\r\narchitectural effect. Instead of standing on a lofty rocky pedestal, and\r\nits pinnacles being relieved boldly against the sky, the Ambêr palace is\r\nsituated in a valley--picturesque, it is true, but where the masonry\r\ncompetes with the rocks in a manner which is certainly unfavourable to\r\nthe effect of the building. Nothing, however, can be more picturesque\r\nthan the way in which the palace grows, as it were, out of a rocky base\r\nor reflects itself in the mirror of the deep lake at its base, and\r\nnothing can be happier than the mode in which the principal apartments\r\nare arranged, so as to afford views over the lake and into the country\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nThe details, too, of this palace are singularly good, and quite free\r\nfrom the feebleness that shortly afterwards characterised the style. In\r\nsome respects, indeed, they contrast favourably with those of Akbar’s\r\ncontemporary palace at Futtehpore Sikri. There the second commandment\r\nconfined the fancy of the decorator to purely inanimate objects; here\r\nthe laxer creed of the Hindus enabled him to indulge in elephant\r\ncapitals and figure-sculpture of men and animals to any extent. The\r\nHindus seem also to have indulged in colour and in mirrors to an extent\r\nthat Akbar did not apparently feel himself justified in employing. The\r\nconsequence is that the whole has a richer and more picturesque effect\r\nthan its Mahomedan rival, but the two together make up a curiously\r\nperfect illustration of the architecture of that day, as seen from a\r\nHindu, contrasted with that from a Mahomedan, point of view.\r\n\r\nIt was the same Mân Sing who erected the Observatory at Benares which\r\nstill bears his name, and though not very architectural in its general\r\nappearance, has on the river-face a balconied window, which is a fair\r\nand pleasing specimen of the architecture of his age (Woodcut No. 270).\r\nHe also was the king who erected the temple at Bindrabun, which has been\r\nillustrated above (pp. 463, 464).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 270. Balcony at the Conservatory, Benares. (From a\r\nDrawing by the late James Prinsep.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEG.\r\n\r\nAll the palaces above described are more or less irregular in their\r\ndisposition, and are all situated on rocky and uneven ground. That at\r\nDeeg, however, is on a perfectly level plain, and laid out with a\r\nregularity that would satisfy the most fastidious Renaissance architect.\r\nIt is wholly the work of Sûraj Mull, the virtual founder of the\r\nBhurtpore dynasty, who commenced it, apparently in 1725, and left it as\r\nwe now see it, when he was slain in battle with Nudjiff Khan in 1763. It\r\nwants, it is true, the massive character of the fortified palaces of\r\nother Rajput states, but for grandeur of conception and beauty of detail\r\nit surpasses them all.\r\n\r\nThe whole palace was to have consisted of a rectangular enclosure twice\r\nthe length of its breadth, surrounded with buildings, with a garden in\r\nthe centre, divided into two parts by a broad terrace, intended to carry\r\nthe central pavilion. Only one of these rectangles has been completed,\r\nmeasuring about 700 feet square,[480] crossed in the centre by ranges of\r\nthe most beautiful fountains and parterres, laid out in the formal style\r\nof the East, and interspersed with architectural ornaments of the most\r\nelaborate finish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 271. Hall at Deeg. (From a Plan by the Author.) Scale 100\r\nft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe pavilion on the north side contains the great audience-hall, 76 ft.\r\n8 in. by 54 ft. 7 in., divided in the centre by a noble range of\r\narcades, behind which are the principal dwelling apartments, two, and in\r\nsome parts three, storeys in height. Opposite this is a pavilion\r\noccupied principally by fountains. On one side stands a marble hall,\r\nattached to an older palace facing the principal pavilion, which was\r\nmeant to occupy the centre of the garden. As will be seen by the plan\r\n(Woodcut No. 271), it is a parallelogram of 152 ft. by 87 ft., each end\r\noccupied by a small but very elegant range of apartments, in two\r\nstoreys; the central hall (108 ft. by 87 ft.) is supported on four rows\r\nof columns, and open at both sides; at each end is a marble reservoir\r\nfor fountains, and a similar one exists externally on each side. The\r\nwhole is roofed with stone, except the central part, which, after being\r\ncontracted by a bold cove, is roofed with a flat ceiling of timber\r\nexquisitely carved. This wooden ceiling seems to have been considered a\r\ndefect, nothing but stone being used in any other part of the palace.\r\nThe architect, therefore, attempted to roof the corresponding pavilion\r\nof the unfinished court with slabs of stone 34 ft. in length, and 18 in.\r\nsquare. Some of these still exist in their places, but their weight was\r\ntoo great for the arcades, which are only 18 in. thick, and not of solid\r\nstone, but of two facings 4 in. or 5 in. thick, and the intermediate\r\nspaces filled in with rubble. Besides this, though the form of the arch\r\nis literally copied from the Mahomedan style, neither here, nor\r\nelsewhere throughout the palace, is there a single true arch, the\r\nopenings being virtually covered by two brackets meeting in the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 272. View from the Central Pavilion in the Palace at\r\nDeeg. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the arcades of these buildings may be gathered\r\nfrom the annexed view (Woodcut No. 272), and may be characterised as\r\nmore elegant than rich. The glory of Deeg, however, consists in the\r\ncornices, which are generally double, a peculiarity not seen elsewhere,\r\nand which for extent of shadow and richness of detail surpass any\r\nsimilar ornaments in India, either in ancient or modern buildings. The\r\nlower cornice is the usual sloping entablature, almost universal in such\r\nbuildings. This was adopted apparently because it took the slope of the\r\ncurtains, which almost invariably hang beneath its projecting shade, and\r\nwhich, when drawn out, seem almost a continuation of it. The upper\r\ncornice, which was horizontal, is peculiar to Deeg, and seems designed\r\nto furnish an extension of the flat roof, which in Eastern palaces is\r\nusually considered the best apartment of the house; but whether designed\r\nfor this or any other purpose, it adds singularly to the richness of the\r\neffect, and by the double shadow affords a relief and character seldom\r\nexceeded even in the East.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the bracket _arcades_ of Deeg are neither so rich\r\nnor so appropriate as the bold bracket _capitals_ of the older styles.\r\nThat the bracket is almost exclusively an original Indian form of\r\ncapital can, I think, scarcely be doubted; but the system was carried\r\nmuch further by the Moguls, especially during the reign of Akbar, than\r\nit had ever been carried by its original inventors, at least in the\r\nNorth. The Hindus, on receiving it back, luxuriated in its picturesque\r\nrichness to an extent that astonishes every beholder; and half the\r\neffect of most of the modern buildings of India is owing to the bold\r\nprojecting balconies and fanciful kiosks that diversify the otherwise\r\nplain walls.\r\n\r\nThe greatest defect of the palace is that the style, when it was\r\nerected, was losing its true form of lithic propriety. The form of its\r\npillars and their ornaments are better suited for wood or metal than for\r\nstone architecture; and though the style of the Moguls, in the last days\r\nof their dynasty, was tending in that direction, it never threw off the\r\nsolidity and constructive propriety to such an extent as is done in\r\nthese modern palaces of the Hindus. It is not at Deeg carried so far as\r\nto be offensive, but it is on the verge of good taste, and in some more\r\nmodern buildings assumes forms more suited for upholstery than for stone\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nSince the time when Sûraj Mull completed this fairy creation, the\r\ntendency, not only with the Rajput princes, but the sovereigns of such\r\nstates as Oude, and even as Delhi, has been to copy the bastard style of\r\nItalian architecture we have introduced into India. It was natural,\r\nperhaps, that they should admire the arts of a race who had shown\r\nthemselves in war and policy superior to themselves; but it was fatal to\r\ntheir arts, and whether a revival is now possible remains to be seen. It\r\nmight be so, if their rulers showed the smallest possible appreciation\r\nof the works of their ancestors, but can hardly be hoped for while a\r\ndepartment of the state is organised, as they must believe, for the\r\nexpress purpose of destroying and obliterating all traces of what was\r\nonce noble and beautiful in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nGHÂTS OR LANDING-PLACES.\r\n\r\nAnother object of architectural magnificence peculiar to northern\r\nHindustan, is the construction of the _ghâts_ that everywhere line the\r\nriver-banks in most of the great cities, more especially those which are\r\nsituated on the Ganges. Benares possesses perhaps the greatest number of\r\nedifices of this class; but from Calcutta to Hurdwar no city is without\r\nsome specimens of this species of architectural display. The Ghoosla\r\nGhât at Benares (Woodcut No. 273), though one of the most modern, may be\r\ntaken as a fair specimen of the class, although many are richer and much\r\nmore elaborately adorned. Their object being to afford easy access to\r\nbathers, the flight of steps in front is in reality the _ghât_, and the\r\nmain object of the erection. These are generally broken, as in this\r\ninstance, by small projections, often crowned by kiosks, which take off\r\nthe monotony inherent in long lines of narrow steps. The flight of\r\nstairs is always backed by a building, which in most instances is merely\r\nan object of architectural display without any particular destination,\r\nexcept to afford shelter from the rays of the sun to such of the idle as\r\nchoose to avail themselves of it. When the bank is high, the lower part\r\nof these buildings is solid, and when, as in this instance, it is nearly\r\nplain, it affords a noble basement to an ornamental upper storey, with\r\nwhich they are generally adorned, or to the temple which frequently\r\ncrowns them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 273. Ghoosla Ghât, Benares. (From Prinsep’s Views.)]\r\n\r\nThough the Ganges is, _par excellence_, the river of ghâts, one of the\r\nmost beautiful in India is that erected by Ahalya Baiee (Holkar’s widow)\r\nat Maheswar, on the Nerbudda; and Ujjain and other ancient cities almost\r\nrival Benares in this respect. Indeed, there is scarcely a tank or\r\nstream in all India that is without its flight of steps, and it is\r\nseldom indeed that these are left without some adornment or an attempt\r\nat architectural display, water being always grateful in so hot a\r\nclimate, and an especially favourite resort with a people so fond of\r\nwashing and so cleanly in their habits as the Hindus.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESERVOIRS.\r\n\r\nThe same fondness for water has given rise to another species of\r\narchitectural display peculiar to India, in the great reservoirs or\r\n_bowlees_, which are found wherever the wells are deep and water far\r\nfrom the surface. In design they are exactly the reverse of the ghâts,\r\nsince the steps are wholly below the ground, and descend to the water\r\noften at a depth of 80 ft. or 100 ft. Externally they make no display,\r\nthe only objects usually seen above ground being two pavilions to mark\r\nthe entrance, between which a bold flight of steps, from 20 ft. to 40\r\nft. in width, leads down to the water. Facing the entrance is a great\r\nscreen, rising perpendicularly from the water to the surface of the\r\nground, and dividing the stairs from a circular shaft or well, up which\r\nthe water is drawn by pulleys by those who prefer that mode of obtaining\r\nit instead of descending the steps. The walls between which the steps\r\ndescend are ornamented by niches, or covered with galleries leading to\r\nthe great screen. Where the depth is great, there is often a screen\r\nacross the stairs about half-way down.\r\n\r\nTo persons not familiar with the East such an architectural object as a\r\nbowlee may seem a strange perversion of ingenuity, but the grateful\r\ncoolness of all subterranean apartments, especially when accompanied by\r\nwater, and the quiet gloom of these recesses, fully compensate, in the\r\neyes of the Hindu, for the more attractive magnificence of the ghâts.\r\nConsequently, the descending flights of which we are now speaking, have\r\noften been made more elaborate and expensive pieces of architecture than\r\nany of the buildings above ground found in their vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMS.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the bunds or dams of the artificial lakes, or great\r\ntanks, which are so necessary for irrigation, are often made works of\r\ngreat architectural magnificence, first by covering them with flights of\r\nsteps, like those of the ghâts, and then erecting temples or pavilions,\r\nand kiosks, interspersed with fountains and statues in breaks between\r\nthese flights. Where all these are of marble, as is sometimes the case\r\nin Rajputana, the whole make up as perfect a piece of architectural\r\ncombination as any the Hindus can boast of.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful of these is that erected by Raj Sing, who\r\nascended the throne of Oudeypore, in 1653, to form the lake of\r\nRajsamundra (Woodcut No. 274), which is one of the most extensive in his\r\ndominions. This bund is 376 paces in length, and wholly covered with\r\nwhite marble steps; and with its beautiful kiosks projecting into the\r\nwater, and the palaces which crown the hills at either end, it makes up\r\na fairy scene of architectural beauty, with its waters and its woods,\r\nwhich is hardly surpassed by any in the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 274. Bund of Lake Rajsamundra. (From a Sketch by the\r\nAuthor.)]\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious, however, to enumerate, without illustrating them,\r\nwhich the limits of this work will not permit, all the modes of\r\narchitectural magnificence of the Hindus. Like all people untrammelled\r\nby rules derived from incongruous objects, and gifted with a feeling for\r\nthe beautiful, they adorn whatever they require, and convert every\r\nobject, however utilitarian in its purposes, into an object of beauty.\r\nThey long ago found out that it is not temples and palaces alone that\r\nare capable of such display, but that everything which man makes may\r\nbecome beautiful, provided the hand of taste be guided by sound\r\njudgment, and that the architect never forgets what the object is, and\r\nnever conceals the constructive exigences of the building itself. It is\r\nsimply this inherent taste and love of beauty, which the Indians seem\r\nalways to have possessed, directed by unaffected honesty of purpose,\r\nwhich enables those who are destitute of political independence, or\r\nknowledge, or power, to erect, even at the present day, buildings that\r\nwill bear comparison with the best of those erected in Europe during the\r\nMiddle Ages. It must be confessed that it would require far more\r\ncomprehensive illustration than the preceding slight sketch of so\r\nextensive a subject can pretend to be, to make this apparent to others.\r\nBut no one who has personally visited the objects of interest with which\r\nIndia abounds can fail to be struck with the extraordinary elegance of\r\ndetail and propriety of design which pervades all the architectural\r\nachievements of the Hindus; and this not only in buildings erected in\r\nformer days, but in those now in course of construction in those parts\r\nof the country to which the bad taste of their European rulers has not\r\nyet penetrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nINDIAN SARACENIC ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a very early period in the world’s history a great group of\r\ncivilized nations existed in Central Asia between the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Indus. They lived apart, having few relations with their neighbours,\r\nexcept of war and hatred, and served rather to separate than to bring\r\ntogether the Indian and European communities which flourished beyond\r\nthem on either hand.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s great raid was the first attempt to break through this\r\nbarrier, and to join the East and West by commercial or social\r\ninterchanges. The steady organisation of the Roman empire succeeded in\r\nconsolidating what that brilliant conqueror had sketched out. During the\r\npermanence of her supremacy the space intervening between India and\r\nEurope was bridged over by the order she maintained among the various\r\ncommunities established in Central Asia, and there seemed no reason why\r\nthe intercourse so established should be interrupted. Unsuspected,\r\nhowever, by the Roman world, two nomade nations, uninfluenced by its\r\ncivilization, hung on either flank of this great line of communication,\r\nready to avail themselves of any moment of weakness that might occur.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, as the most impetuous, and nearest the centre, were the first\r\nto break their bounds; and in the course of the 7th century Syria,\r\nPersia, Egypt, and the north of Africa became theirs. Spain was\r\nconquered, and India nearly shared the same fate. Under Muawiah, the\r\nfirst Khalif of the Ommiahs, two attempts were made to cross the Indus\r\nby the southern route--that which the Scythians had successfully\r\nfollowed a short time before. Both these attempts failed, but under\r\nWalid, Muhamed Kasim, A.H. 99, did effect a settlement in Scinde. It\r\nproved a barren conquest, however; for though a Mahomedan dynasty was\r\nestablished there, it soon became independent of the Khalifat, and\r\neventually died out.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the Khalifat was as brief as it was brilliant. Its hour\r\nof greatest glory was about the year A.D. 800, in the reign of Haroun al\r\nRashid. From that time decay set in; and after two centuries more the\r\neffeminacy and corruption inherent in Eastern dynasties had so far\r\nprogressed as to encourage the Northern hordes to move.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the 11th century the Tartar hordes, who were\r\nhitherto only known as shepherds pasturing their herds on the steppes of\r\nNorthern Asia, first made their appearance south of the Paropamisan\r\nrange as conquerors; and for six centuries their progress was steadily\r\nonwards, till, in the year A.D. 1683, we find the Turks encamped under\r\nthe walls of Vienna, and the Mogul Aurungzebe lord paramount of the\r\nwhole of India Proper, while Egypt and all the intervening countries\r\nowned the rule of sovereigns of Turanian race.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the nations under the Arab Khalifat has already been\r\ndescribed, and is of very minor importance.[481] The ruling people were\r\nof Semitic race, and had no great taste for architectural magnificence;\r\nand unless where they happened to govern a people of another stock, they\r\nhave left few traces of their art.\r\n\r\nWith the Northern hordes the case was widely different; they were,\r\nwithout an exception, of Turanian blood, more or less pure, and wherever\r\nthey went their mosques, and especially their tombs, remain to mark\r\ntheir presence, and to convey an idea of their splendour. In order to\r\nunderstand what follows, it is necessary to bear in mind that the\r\nSemitic conquest, from Mecca as a centre, extended from the mouths of\r\nthe Guadalquivir to those of the Indus, and left but little worthy of\r\nremark in architecture. The Turanian conquest, from Bokhara and Balkh as\r\ncentres, extended from Constantinople to Cuttack, and covered the whole\r\nintervening space with monuments of every class. Those of the west and\r\ncentre have already been described in speaking of Turkey and Persia; the\r\nEastern branch remains to be discussed, and its monuments are those of\r\nwhich this division of the work purports to be a description.\r\n\r\nThe Saracenic architects showed in India the same pliancy in adopting\r\nthe styles of the various people among whom they had settled which\r\ncharacterised their practice in the countries already described. It thus\r\nhappens that in India we have at least twelve or fifteen different\r\nstyles of Mahomedan architecture: and if an attempt were made to exhaust\r\nall the examples, it would be found necessary to enumerate even a\r\ngreater number. Meanwhile, however, the following thirteen divisions\r\nwill probably be found sufficient for present purposes:--\r\n\r\n1. The first of these is that of _Ghazni_, which, though not, strictly\r\nspeaking, in India, had without doubt the most important influence on\r\nthe Indian styles, and formed in fact the stepping-stone by means of\r\nwhich the architecture of the West was introduced into India, and it\r\nlong remained the connecting link between the styles of the Eastern and\r\nthose of the Western world. It would consequently be of the greatest\r\nimportance in enabling us to understand the early examples of the style\r\nin India Proper, if we could describe this one with anything like\r\nprecision, but for that we must wait till some qualified person visits\r\nthe province.\r\n\r\n2. Next to this comes the _Pathan_ style of northern India (A.D.\r\n1193-1554), spreading over the whole of Upper India, and lasting for\r\nabout three centuries and a half. After the death, however, of Ala\r\nud-dîn (A.D. 1316) the central power was at times so weak, that the\r\nrecently conquered outlying provinces were frequently enabled to render\r\nthemselves independent, and when this was the case, exhibited their\r\nindividuality everywhere, by inventing a style of architecture\r\nexpressive of their local peculiarities.\r\n\r\n3. One of the first to exhibit this tendency was the brilliant but\r\nshort-lived Sharki dynasty of _Jaunpore_ (A.D. 1394-1476). Though\r\nexisting for less than a century, they adorned their capital with a\r\nseries of mosques and other buildings which are hardly surpassed by\r\nthose of any city in India for magnificence, and by none for a\r\nwell-marked individuality of treatment.\r\n\r\n4. The style adopted by the kings of _Gujerat_ during their period of\r\nindependence (A.D. 1396-1572) was richer and more varied than that of\r\nJaunpore, though hardly so original or marked by such individuality.\r\nThey borrowed too much, physically as well as intellectually, from the\r\narchitecture of the Jains, among whom they were located, to be entirely\r\nindependent; but the richness of their style is in proportion to the\r\nHindu details they introduced.\r\n\r\n5. _Malwa_ became independent in A.D. 1401, and between that date and\r\nA.D. 1568, when they were absorbed in the Mogul empire, her kings\r\nadorned their capital at Mandu with palaces and mosques of great\r\nmagnificence, but more similar to the parent style at Delhi than the two\r\nlast-named styles, and wanting, consequently, in the local\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\n6. Bengal was early erected into a separate kingdom--in A.D. 1203--more\r\nor less independent of the central power; and during its\r\ncontinuance--till A.D. 1573--the capitals, _Gaur_ and Maldah, were\r\nadorned with many splendid edifices. Generally these were in brick, and\r\nare now so overgrown by jungle as to be either ruined or nearly\r\ninvisible. They are singularly picturesque, however, and display all the\r\nfeatures of a strongly-marked individuality of style.\r\n\r\nThese six divisions are probably sufficient to characterise the\r\nMahomedan styles north of the Nerbudda. To the south of that river there\r\nare three well-marked styles.\r\n\r\n7. First that of the _Bahmani_ dynasty. First at Kalbergah, A.D. 1347,\r\nand afterwards at Bidar, A.D. 1426, they adorned their capitals with\r\nedifices of great magnificence and well-marked individuality, before\r\nthey were absorbed, in A.D. 1525, in the great Mogul empire.\r\n\r\n8. Next to these was the still more celebrated Adil Shahi dynasty of\r\n_Bijapur_ (A.D. 1489-1660). Their style differed most essentially from\r\nall those above enumerated, and was marked by a grandeur of conception\r\nand boldness in construction unequalled by any edifices erected in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n9. The third southern style is that of the Kutub Shahi dynasty of\r\n_Golconda_, A.D. 1512-1672. Their tombs are splendid, and form one of\r\nthe most striking groups in India, but show evident signs of a decadence\r\nthat was too surely invading art at the age when they were erected.\r\n\r\n10. One by one all these brilliant individualities were absorbed in the\r\ngreat _Mogul_ empire, founded by Baber, A.D. 1494, and which, though\r\npractically perishing on the death of Aurungzebe, A.D. 1706, may be\r\nconsidered as existing till the middle of the last century, A.D. 1750.\r\nIt is to this dynasty that Agra, Delhi, and most of the towns in\r\nnorthern India owe their most splendid edifices.\r\n\r\n11. Before leaving this branch of the subject, it may be expedient to\r\nenumerate the style of Moslem art existing in _Scinde_. Practically, it\r\nis Persian both in its form and the style of decoration, and must have\r\nexisted in this province from a very ancient time. All the examples,\r\nhowever, now known of it are comparatively modern, and bring us back,\r\ncuriously enough, to the neighbourhood of Ghazni, from which we started\r\nin our enumeration.\r\n\r\n12. Leaving these, which may be called the true styles of Mahomedan\r\narchitecture, we have two which may be designated as the bastard styles.\r\nThe first of these is that of _Oude_ (A.D. 1756-1847). In its capital\r\nthere are ranges of building equal in extent and richness to those of\r\nany of the capitals above enumerated, but degraded in taste to an extent\r\nit is hardly possible to credit in a people who so shortly before had\r\nshown themselves capable of such noble aspirations.\r\n\r\n13. The style adopted by the short-lived dynasty of _Mysore_ (A.D.\r\n1760-1799), being further removed from the influences of European\r\nvulgarity, is not so degraded as that of Lucknow, but is poor and\r\ninartistic when compared with earlier styles.\r\n\r\nIn an exhaustive treatise on the subject, the styles of Ahmednugger and\r\nArungabad, A.D. 1490-1707, ought, perhaps, to be enumerated, and some\r\nminor styles elsewhere. These have not, however, sufficient\r\nindividuality to deserve being erected into separate styles, and the\r\namount of illustration that can be introduced into a work like the\r\npresent is not sufficient to render the differences sensible to those\r\nwho are not personally acquainted with the examples.\r\n\r\nEven as it is, it would require a much more extensive series of\r\nillustrations than that here given to make even their most marked merits\r\nor peculiarities evident to those who have no other means than what such\r\na work as this affords of forming an opinion regarding them. Each of\r\nthese thirteen styles deserves a monograph; but, except for Bijapur[482]\r\nand Ahmedabad,[483] nothing of the sort has yet been attempted, and even\r\nthe two works in which this has been attempted for these two capitals by\r\nno means exhaust the materials available for the purpose. Let us hope\r\nthat these deficiencies will be supplied, and the others undertaken\r\nbefore long and before it is too late, for the buildings are fast\r\nperishing from the ravages of time and climate and the still more\r\ndestructive exigences of the present governing power in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGHAZNI.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nTomb of Mahmúd--Gates of Somnath--Minars on the Plain.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nSabuktagin, founder     A.D.                  975\r\nMahmúd                                        977\r\nMasúd                                        1030\r\nAbdul-rashid                                 1048\r\nIbrahim                                      1054\r\nShahab ud-dîn (first of Ghori dynasty)       1139\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the latter part of the 9th century the power of the Khalifs of\r\nBagdad was sinking into that state of rapid decline which is the fate of\r\nall Eastern dynasties. During the reign of Al Motamed, A.D. 870-891,\r\nEgypt became independent, and the northern province of Bokhara threw off\r\nthe yoke under the governor appointed by the Khalif, Nasr ben Ahmed, a\r\ndescendant of Saman, a robber chief, who declared and maintained his\r\nindependence, and so formed the Samanian dynasty. After the dynasty had\r\nexisted about a century, Sabuktagin, a Tûrkish slave belonging to a\r\ngeneral of one of the last of the Samanian kings, rendered himself also\r\nindependent of his master, and established himself in Ghazni, of which\r\nhe was governor, founding the well-known dynasty of Ghaznavides. His\r\nsuccessor, Mahmúd, A.D. 977-1030, is one of the best-known kings in\r\nIndian history owing to his brilliant campaigns in India, and more\r\nespecially that in which he destroyed the celebrated temple of Somnath.\r\n\r\nOn his return from an earlier campaign, in which he had sacked the town\r\nof Muttra, we learn from Ferishta that the king ordered a magnificent\r\nmosque to be built of marble and granite, afterwards known by the name\r\nof the Celestial Bride. Near it he founded a university. When the\r\nnobility of Ghazni perceived the taste of their king in architecture,\r\nthey also endeavoured to vie with one another in the magnificence of\r\ntheir palaces, as well as in the public buildings which were raised for\r\nthe embellishment of the city. “Thus,” continues the historian, “the\r\ncapital was in a short time ornamented with mosques, porches, fountains,\r\naqueducts, reservoirs, and cisterns, beyond any city in the East.”[484]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 275. Minar at Ghazni. (From a Drawing by G. T. Vigne,\r\nEsq.)]\r\n\r\nThe plain of Ghazni still shows the remains of this splendour; and, in\r\nthe dearth of information regarding Persian art of that age, an account\r\nof it would be one of the most interesting and valuable pieces of\r\ninformation we could receive. These ruins, however, have not been as yet\r\neither examined or described;[485] and even the tomb of the Great\r\nMahmúd is unknown to us except by name,[486] notwithstanding the\r\ncelebrity it acquired from the removal of its gates to India at the\r\ntermination of our disastrous campaigns in that country.\r\n\r\nThe gates are of Deodar pine,[487] and the carved ornaments on them are\r\nso similar to those found at Cairo, on the mosque of Ebn Touloun and\r\nother buildings of that age, as not only to prove that they are of the\r\nsame date, but also to show how similar were the modes of decoration at\r\nthese two extremities of the Moslem empire at the time of their\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 276. Ornaments from the Tomb of Mahmúd at Ghazni.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time there is nothing in their style of ornamentation that\r\nat all resembles anything found in any Hindu temple, either of their age\r\nor at any other time. There is, in fact, no reason for doubting that\r\nthese gates were made for the place where they were found.[488] If any\r\nother parts of the tomb are ornamented in the same style, it would be of\r\ngreat interest to have them drawn. It probably is, however, from the\r\nJumma Musjid that we shall obtain the best picture of the arts of that\r\nday, when any one will take the trouble of examining it.\r\n\r\nTwo minars still adorn the plain outside the city, and form, if not the\r\nmost striking, at least the most prominent of the ruins of that city.\r\nNeither of them was ever attached to a mosque; they are, indeed, pillars\r\nof victory, or _Jaya Stambhas_, like those at Chittore and elsewhere in\r\nIndia, and are such as we might expect to find in a country so long\r\nBuddhist. One of them was erected by Mahmúd himself; the other was\r\nbuilt, or at least finished, by Masúd, one of his immediate\r\nsuccessors.[489]\r\n\r\nThe lower part of these towers is of a star-like form--the plan being\r\napparently formed by placing two squares diagonally the one over the\r\nother. The upper part, rising to the height of about 140 ft. from the\r\nground, is circular; both are of brickwork, covered with ornaments of\r\nterra-cotta of extreme elaboration and beauty, and retaining their\r\nsharpness to the present day.\r\n\r\nSeveral other minars of the same class are found further west, even as\r\nfar as the roots of the Caucasus,[490] which, like these, were pillars\r\nof victory, erected by the conquerors on their battle-fields. None of\r\nthem have the same architectural merit as those of Ghazni, at least in\r\ntheir present state, though it may be that their ornaments, having been\r\nin stucco or some perishable material, have disappeared, leaving us now\r\nonly the skeleton of what they were.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Mahmúd’s successors left the Indians in repose for more\r\nthan a century and a half; and, like all Eastern dynasties, the\r\nGhaznavides were gradually sinking to inevitable decay, when their fall\r\nwas precipitated by the crimes of one of them, which were fearfully\r\navenged by the destruction of their empire and capital by Ala ud-dîn,\r\nand their race was at length superseded by that of the Ghori, in the\r\nperson of Shahab ud-dîn, in the year 1183.\r\n\r\nThough centuries of misrule have weighed on this country since the time\r\nof the Ghaznavides, it is scarcely probable that all traces of their\r\nmagnificence have passed away; but till their cities are examined by\r\nsome one competent to discriminate between what is good or bad, or old\r\nor new, we must be content merely to indicate the position of the style,\r\nleaving this chapter to be written hereafter when the requisite\r\ninformation shall have been obtained. In the meanwhile it is\r\nsatisfactory to know that between Herat and the Indus there do exist a\r\nsufficient number of monuments to enable us to connect the styles of the\r\nWest with those in the East. They have been casually described by\r\ntravellers, but not in such a manner as to render them available for our\r\npurposes; and in the present unsettled state of the country it may be\r\nsome time yet before their elucidation can be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPATHAN STYLE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nMosque at Old Delhi--Kutub Minar--Tomb of Ala ud-dîn--Pathan\r\nTombs--Ornamentation of Pathan Tombs.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nShahab ud-dîn Ghori                                A.D. 1192\r\nKutub ud-dîn Ibek                                       1206\r\nShum ud-dîn Altumsh                                     1210\r\nAla ud-dîn Khilji                                       1295\r\nTugluck Shah                                            1321\r\nNasar ud-dîn last of the Khiljis                        1393\r\nKhyer Khan under Tamerlane                              1414\r\nBehloli Lodi                                            1450\r\nShere Shah                                              1510\r\nSekunder defeated by Akbar                              1554\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all the vigour of a new race, the Ghorians set about the conquest\r\nof India. After sustaining a defeat in the year 1191, Shahab ud-dîn\r\nagain entered India in A.D. 1193, when he attacked and defeated\r\nPrithiraj of Delhi. This success was followed by the conquest of Canouge\r\nin A.D. 1194; and after the fall of these two, the capitals of the\r\ngreatest empires in the peninsula, India may be said to have been\r\nconquered before his death, which happened in A.D. 1206.\r\n\r\nAt his death his great empire fell to pieces, and India fell to the\r\nshare of Kutub ud-dîn Ibek. This prince was originally a Tûrkish slave,\r\nwho afterwards became one of Shahab ud-dîn’s generals and contributed\r\ngreatly by his talents and military skill to the success of his master.\r\nHe and his successor, Altumsh, continued nobly the work so successfully\r\nbegun, and before the death of the latter, in A.D. 1235, the empire of\r\nnorthern India had permanently passed from the hands of the Hindus to\r\nthose of their Mahomedan conquerors.\r\n\r\nFor a century and a half after the conquest the empire continued a\r\nunited whole, under Tûrkish, or, as they are usually called, Pathan\r\ndynasties. These monarchs exhibited a continued vigour and energy very\r\nunusual in the East, and not only sustained and consolidated, but\r\nincreased by successive conquests from the infidels, that newly-acquired\r\naccession to the dominions of the faithful, and during that time Delhi\r\ncontinued practically the capital of this great empire. In the latter\r\nhalf, however, of the 14th century, symptoms of disintegration\r\nmanifested themselves. One after another the governors of distant\r\nprovinces reared the standard of revolt, and successfully established\r\nindependent kingdoms, rivalling the parent state in power and in the\r\nsplendour of their capitals. Still Delhi remained the nominal head at\r\nleast of this confederation of states--if it may be so called--till the\r\ntime when Baber (A.D. 1494), the fourth in descent from Tamerlane,\r\ninvaded Hindustan. He put an end to the Pathan sway, after it had lasted\r\nfor three centuries and a half, and finally succeeded in establishing\r\nthe celebrated dynasty of the Moguls, which during six successive\r\nreigns, extending over the extraordinary period of more than two\r\ncenturies (A.D. 1494-1707), reconsolidated the Moslem empire into one\r\ngreat whole, which reached a degree of splendour and of power almost\r\nunknown in the East.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more brilliant, and at the same time more\r\ncharacteristic, than the commencement of the architectural career of\r\nthese Pathans in India. So soon as they felt themselves at all sure of\r\ntheir conquest, they set to work to erect two great mosques in their two\r\nprincipal capitals of Ajmir and Delhi, of such magnificence as should\r\nredound to the glory of their religion and mark their triumph over the\r\nidolators. A nation of soldiers equipped for conquest, and that only,\r\nthey had of course brought with them neither artists nor architects,\r\nbut, like all nations of Turanian origin, they had strong architectural\r\ninstincts, and having a style of their own, they could hardly go wrong\r\nin any architectural project they might attempt. At the same time, they\r\nfound among their new subjects an infinite number of artists quite\r\ncapable of carrying out any design that might be propounded to them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they found in the colonnaded courts of the Jaina\r\ntemples nearly all that was wanted for a ready-made mosque. All that was\r\nrequired was the removal of the temple in its centre, and the erection\r\nof a new wall on the west side, adorned with niches--mihrabs--to point\r\nout to the faithful the direction in which Mecca lay, towards which, as\r\nis well known, they were commanded in the Koran to turn when they\r\nprayed. It is not certain, however, that they were ever in India content\r\nwith this only. In the two instances at least to which we are now\r\nreferring, they determined in addition to erect a screen of arches in\r\nfront of the Jaina pillars, and to adorn it with all the richness and\r\nelaboration of carving which their Indian subjects were capable of\r\nexecuting. Nothing could be more successful than the results. There is a\r\nlargeness and grandeur about the plain simple outline of the Mahomedan\r\narches which quite overshadows the smaller parts of the Hindu fanes, and\r\nat the same time the ornamentation, though applied to a greater extent\r\nthan in any other known examples, is kept so flat as never to interfere\r\nwith or break the simple outlines of the architectural construction.\r\nThere may be other examples of surface-decoration as elaborate as this,\r\nbut hardly anywhere on such a scale. Some parts of the interior of Sta.\r\nSophia at Constantinople are as beautiful,[491] but they are only a few\r\nsquare yards. The palace at Meshita, if completed, might have rivalled\r\nit, but it is a fragment;[492] and there may be--certainly\r\nwere--examples in Persia between the times of Chosroes and Harun\r\nal-Rashid, which may have equalled these, but they have perished, or at\r\nleast are not known to us now; and even if they ever existed, must have\r\nbeen unlike these mosques. In them we find a curious exemplification of\r\nsome of the best qualities of the art, as exhibited previously by the\r\nHindus, and practised afterwards by their conquerors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELHI.\r\n\r\nOf the two mosques at Delhi and at Ajmir, the first named is the\r\nearlier, having been begun some seven or eight years before the other,\r\nand is also very much the larger.[493] It is, besides, associated with\r\nthe Kutub Minar, and some of the most beautiful tombs of the age, which\r\naltogether make up a group with which nothing at Ajmir can compare. The\r\nsituation, too, of the Delhi ruins is singularly beautiful, for they\r\nstand on the gentle slope of a hill, overlooking a plain that had once\r\napparently been a lake, but which afterwards became the site of three\r\nsuccessive capitals of the East. In front are the ruins of Tugluckabad,\r\nthe gigantic fort of an old Pathan chief; and further north the plain is\r\nstill covered with the ruins of Old Delhi, the capital of the later\r\nPathans and earlier Moguls. Beyond that, at the distance of nine or ten\r\nmiles, are seen the towers of Shahjehanabad, the modern capital, and\r\ntill recently the seat of the nominal monarchy of the Great Mogul. Still\r\nfurther north are situated the civil stations and cantonments of the\r\nBritish rulers of the country. It is a fortunate circumstance that the\r\nBritish station was not, as at Agra, placed in the midst of the ruins,\r\nsince it is to this that we owe their preservation. But for the\r\ndistance, marble columns would doubtless have been taken for all\r\npurposes for which they might have been available, with a total\r\ndisregard to their beauty, and the interest of the ruins thereby\r\nannihilated. Even as it is, the buildings belonging to the celebrated\r\nShahlimar gardens, which were the only buildings of importance in the\r\nneighbourhood of the English station, have disappeared; but these are\r\nof slight importance as compared with the ruins further south.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the principal ruins will be understood from\r\nthe plan (Woodcut No. 277), which was taken with great care, though the\r\nscale to which it has been necessary to reduce it prevents all its\r\npeculiarities from being seen. To understand it, it is necessary to bear\r\nin mind that all the pillars are of Hindu, and all the walls of\r\nMahomedan, architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 277. Plan of Ruins in Old Delhi. (From a Plan by the\r\nAuthor.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nIt is a little difficult to determine to what extent the pillars now\r\nstand as originally arranged by the Hindus, or how far they have been\r\ntaken down and re-arranged by the conquerors. Even supposing them to be\r\nundisturbed, it is quite evident that the enclosing walls were erected\r\nby the Moslems, since all the stringcourses are covered with ornaments\r\nin their style, and all the openings possess pointed arches, which the\r\nHindus never used. On the whole the probability seems to be that the\r\nentire structure was re-arranged in the form we now see it by the\r\nMahomedans. The celebrated mosque at Canouge is undoubtedly a Jaina\r\ntemple, re-arranged on a plan precisely similar to that of the mosque of\r\nAmrou at Old Cairo (Woodcut No. 921, vol. ii.). The roof and domes are\r\nall of Jaina architecture, so that no trace of the Moorish style is to\r\nbe seen internally; but the exterior is as purely of Mahomedan\r\narchitecture. There is another mosque at Dhar, near Mandu, of more\r\nmodern date, and, without doubt, a re-arrangement of a Jaina temple.\r\nAnother, in the fort at Jaunpore, as well as many other mosques at\r\nAhmedabad and elsewhere, all show the same system of taking down and\r\nre-arranging the materials on a different plan. If, therefore, the\r\npillars at the Kutub were _in situ_, the case would be exceptional;[494]\r\nbut I cannot, nevertheless, help suspecting that the two-storeyed\r\npavilions in the angles, and those behind the screen may be as\r\noriginally erected, and some of the others may be so also; but to this\r\nwe will return when speaking of the Ajmir mosque, where the Jaina\r\npillars are almost certainly as first arranged. It is quite certain,\r\nhowever, that some of the pillars at the Kutub are made up of dissimilar\r\nfragments, and were placed where they now stand by the builders of the\r\nmosque. The only question--and it is not a very important one--is, how\r\nmany were so treated? It may, however, be necessary to explain that\r\nthere could be no difficulty in taking down and rebuilding these\r\nerections, because the joints of the pillars are all fitted with the\r\nprecision that Hindu patience alone could give. Each compartment of the\r\nroof is composed of nine stones--four architraves, four angular and one\r\ncentral slab (as explained in diagram No. 114, p. 214), all so exactly\r\nfitted, and so independent of cement, as easily to be taken down and put\r\nup again. The same is true of the domes, all which being honestly and\r\nfairly fitted, would suffer no damage from the process of removal and\r\nre-erection.\r\n\r\nThe section (Woodcut No. 278) of one half of the principal colonnade\r\n(the one facing the great series of arches) will explain its form\r\nbetter than words can do. It is so purely Jaina, that it should,\r\nperhaps, have been mentioned in speaking of that style; but as forming a\r\npart of the earliest mosque in India, it is more appropriately\r\nintroduced in this place. The pillars are of the same order as those\r\nused on Mount Abu (Woodcut No. 130), except that those at Delhi are much\r\nricher and more elaborate. Most of them probably belong to the 11th or\r\n12th century, and are among the few specimens to be found in India that\r\nseem to be overloaded with ornament. There is not one inch of plain\r\nsurface from the capital to the base, except the pillars behind the\r\nscreen and some others which may belong to older buildings. Still the\r\nornament is so sharp and so cleverly executed, and the effect, in their\r\npresent state of decay and ruin so picturesque, that it is very\r\ndifficult to find fault with what is so beautiful. In some instances the\r\nfigures that were on the shafts of the pillars have been cut off, as\r\noffensive to Mahomedan strictness with regard to idolatrous images; but\r\non the roof and less seen parts, the cross-legged figures of the Jaina\r\nsaints, and other emblems of that religion, may still be detected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 278. Section of part of East Colonnade at the Kutub, Old\r\nDelhi. Scale 25 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe glory of the mosque, however, is not in these Hindu remains, but in\r\nthe great range of arches on the western side, extending north and south\r\nfor about 385 ft., and consisting of three greater and eight smaller\r\narches; the central one 22 ft. wide and 53 ft. high; the larger\r\nside-arches 24 ft. 4 in., and about the same height as the central arch;\r\nthe smaller arches, which are unfortunately much ruined, are about half\r\nthese dimensions (Woodcut No. 279). Behind this, at the distance of 32\r\nft., are the foundations of another wall; but only intended, apparently,\r\nto be carried as high as the roof of the Hindu pillars it encloses. It\r\nseems probable that the Hindu pillars between the two screens were the\r\nonly part proposed to be roofed, since some of them are built into the\r\nback part of the great arches, and all above them is quite plain and\r\nsmooth, without the least trace of any intention to construct a vault or\r\nroof of any sort. Indeed, a roof is by no means an essential part of a\r\nmosque; a wall facing Mecca is all that is required, and in India is\r\nfrequently all that is built, though an enclosure is often added in\r\nfront to protect the worshippers from interruption. Roofed colonnades\r\nare, of course, convenient and ornamental accompaniments, yet far from\r\nbeing indispensable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 279. Central Range of Arches at the Kutub. (From a Sketch\r\nby the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThe history of this mosque, as told in its construction, is as curious\r\nas anything about it. It seems that the Afghan conquerors had a\r\ntolerably distinct idea that pointed arches were the true form for\r\narchitectural openings; but, being without science sufficient to\r\nconstruct them, they left the Hindu architects and builders whom they\r\nemployed to follow their own devices as to the mode of carrying out the\r\nform. The Hindus up to this time had never built arches--nor, indeed,\r\ndid they for centuries afterwards. Accordingly, they proceeded to make\r\nthe pointed openings on the same principle upon which they built their\r\ndomes. They carried them up in horizontal courses as far as they could,\r\nand then closed them by long slabs meeting at the top, the construction\r\nbeing, in fact, that of the arch of the aqueduct at Tusculum, shown in\r\nWoodcut No. 178, vol. i.[495] The same architects were employed by\r\ntheir masters to ornament the faces of these arches; and this they did\r\nby copying and repeating the ornaments on the pillars and friezes on the\r\nopposite sides of the court, covering the whole with a lace-work of\r\nintricate and delicate carving, such as no other mosque except that at\r\nAjmir ever received before or since; and which--though perhaps in a\r\ngreat measure thrown away when used on such a scale--is, without\r\nexception, the most exquisite specimen of its class known to exist\r\nanywhere. The stone being particularly hard and good, the carving\r\nretains its freshness to the present day, and is only destroyed above\r\nthe arches, where the faulty Hindu construction has superinduced\r\npremature decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 280. Minar of Kutub.\r\n\r\n(From a Sketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThe Kutub Minar, or great minaret, is 48 ft. 4 in. in diameter at the\r\nbase, and, when measured in 1794, was 242 ft. in height.[496] Even then,\r\nhowever, its capital was ruined, so that some 10 ft., or perhaps 20 ft.,\r\nmust be added to this to complete its original elevation. It is\r\nornamented by four boldly-projecting balconies; one at 97 ft., the\r\nsecond at 148 ft., the third at 188 ft., and the fourth at 214 ft. from\r\nthe ground; between which are richly-sculptured raised belts containing\r\ninscriptions. In the lower storey the projecting ribs which form the\r\nflutes are alternately angular and circular; in the second circular and\r\nin the third angular only. Above this the minar is plain, and\r\nprincipally of white marble, with belts of the same red sandstone of\r\nwhich the three lower storeys are composed (Woodcut No. 280).\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether the angular flutings are copied from some\r\npeculiarity found in the minarets at Khorasan and further westward, or\r\nwhether they are derived from the forms of the temples of the Jains. The\r\nforms of the bases of the minarets at Ghazni appear to lend probability\r\nto the first hypothesis; but the star-like form of many\r\ntemples--principally Jaina--in Mysore and elsewhere (_ante_, p. 394, _et\r\nseqq._) would seem to countenance the idea of their being of Hindu\r\norigin. No star-like forms have yet, however, been found so far north,\r\nand their destruction has been too complete for us to hope that they may\r\nbe found now. Be this as it may, it is probably not too much to assert\r\nthat the Kutub Minar is the most beautiful example of its class known to\r\nexist anywhere. The rival that will occur at once to most people is the\r\ncampanile at Florence, built by Giotto. That is, it is true, 30 ft.\r\ntaller, but it is crushed by the mass of the cathedral alongside; and,\r\nbeautiful though it is, it wants that poetry of design and exquisite\r\nfinish of detail which marks every moulding of the minar. It might have\r\nbeen better if the slope of the sides had been at a higher angle, but\r\nthat is only apparent when seen at a distance; when viewed from the\r\ncourt of the mosque its form is perfect, and, under any aspect, is\r\npreferable to the prosaic squareness of the outline of the Italian\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe only Mahomedan building known to be taller than this is the minaret\r\nof the mosque of Hassan, at Cairo (p. 389 and Woodcut No. 928, vol.\r\nii.); but as the pillar at Old Delhi is a wholly independent building,\r\nit has a far nobler appearance, and both in design and finish far\r\nsurpasses not only its Egyptian rival, but any building of its class\r\nknown to me in the whole world. This, however, must not be looked at as\r\nif erected for the same purposes as those usually attached to mosques\r\nelsewhere. It was not designed as a place from which the müeddin should\r\ncall the prayers, though its lower gallery may have been used for that\r\npurpose also, but as a Tower of Victory--a Jaya Stambha, in fact--an\r\nemblem of conquest, which the Hindus could only too easily understand\r\nand appreciate.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of 470 ft. north of this one a second minar was\r\ncommenced, by Ala ud-dîn, of twice its dimensions, or 297 ft. in\r\ncircumference. It was only carried up to the height of 40 ft., and\r\nabandoned probably in consequence of the removal of the seat of\r\ngovernment to the new capital of Tugluckabad.\r\n\r\nThe date of all these buildings is known with sufficient exactness from\r\nthe inscriptions which they bear,[497] from which it appears that the\r\ninner court was enclosed by Shahab ud-dîn. The central range of arches\r\n(Woodcut No. 279) was built by Kutub ud-dîn; the wings by Altumsh,\r\nwhose tomb is behind the northern range, and the Kutub Minar was either\r\nbuilt or finished by the same monarch; they extend, therefore, from A.D.\r\n1196-1235, at which date they were left incomplete in consequence of the\r\ndeath of the last-named king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 281. Iron Pillar at Kutub. (From a Photograph.) The\r\ndotted line shows the extent below the ground.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting objects connected with this mosque is the\r\niron pillar which stands--and apparently always has stood--in the centre\r\nof its courtyard (Woodcut No. 281). It now stands 22 ft. above the\r\nground, and as the depth under the pavement is now ascertained to be\r\nonly 20 in., the total height is 23 ft. 8 in.[498] Its diameter at the\r\nbase is 16·4 in., at the capital 12·05 in. The capital is 3½ ft.\r\nhigh, and is sharply and clearly wrought into the Persian form that\r\nmakes it look as if it belonged to an earlier period than it does; and\r\nit has the amalaka moulding, which is indicative of considerable\r\nantiquity. It has not, however, been yet correctly ascertained what its\r\nage really is. There is an inscription upon it, but without a date. From\r\nthe form of its alphabet, Prinsep ascribed it to the 3rd or 4th\r\ncentury;[499] Bhau Daji, on the same evidence, to the end of the 5th or\r\nbeginning of the 6th century.[500] The truth probably lies between the\r\ntwo. My own conviction is that it belongs to one of the Chandra Rajas of\r\nthe Gupta dynasty, either consequently to A.D. 363 or A.D. 400.\r\n\r\nTaking A.D. 400 as a mean date--and it certainly is not far from the\r\ntruth--it opens our eyes to an unsuspected state of affairs to find the\r\nHindus at that age capable of forging a bar of iron larger than any that\r\nhave been forged even in Europe up to a very late date, and not\r\nfrequently even now. As we find them, however, a few centuries\r\nafterwards using bars as long as this lât in roofing the porch of the\r\ntemple at Kanaruc (_ante_, p. 222), we must now believe that they were\r\nmuch more familiar with the use of this metal than they afterwards\r\nbecame. It is almost equally startling to find that, after an exposure\r\nto wind and rain for fourteen centuries, it is unrusted, and the capital\r\nand inscription are as clear and as sharp now as when put up fourteen\r\ncenturies ago.[501]\r\n\r\nAs the inscription informs us the pillar was dedicated to Vishnu, there\r\nis little doubt that it originally supported a figure of Garuda on the\r\nsummit which the Mahomedans of course removed; but the real object of\r\nits erection was as a pillar of victory to record the “defeat of the\r\nBalhikas,[502] near the seven mouths of the Sindhu,” or Indus. It is, to\r\nsay the least of it, a curious coincidence, that eight centuries\r\nafterwards men from that same Bactrian country should have erected a\r\nJaya Stambha ten times as tall as this one, in the same courtyard, to\r\ncelebrate their victory over the descendants of those Hindus who so long\r\nbefore had expelled their ancestors from the country.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the north-west corner of the mosque stands the tomb\r\nof Altumsh, the founder. Though small, it is one of the richest examples\r\nof Hindu art applied to Mahomedan purposes that Old Delhi affords, and\r\nis extremely beautiful, though the builders still display a certain\r\ndegree of inaptness in fitting the details to their new purposes. The\r\neffect at present is injured by the want of a roof, which, judging from\r\nappearance, was never completed, if ever commenced. In addition to the\r\nbeauty of its details it is interesting as being the oldest tomb known\r\nto exist in India. He died A.D. 1236.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 282. Interior of a Tomb at Old Delhi. (From a Sketch by\r\nthe Author.)]\r\n\r\nA more beautiful example than even this is the other, shown on the left\r\nhand of the plan (Woodcut No. 277). It was erected by Ala ud-dîn Khilji,\r\nand the date 1310 is found among its inscriptions. It is therefore\r\nabout a century more modern than the other buildings of the place, and\r\ndisplays the Pathan style at its period of greatest perfection, when the\r\nHindu masons had learned to fit their exquisite style of decoration to\r\nthe forms of their foreign masters. Its walls are decorated internally\r\nwith a diaper pattern of unrivalled excellence, and the mode in which\r\nthe square is changed into an octagon is more simply elegant and\r\nappropriate than any other example I am acquainted with in India. The\r\npendentives accord perfectly with the pointed openings in the four other\r\nfaces, and are in every respect appropriately constructive.[503] True,\r\nthere are defects. For instance, they are rather too plain for the\r\nelaborate diapering which covers the whole of the lower part of the\r\nbuilding both internally and externally; but ornament might easily have\r\nbeen added; and their plainness accords with the simplicity of the dome,\r\nwhich is indeed by no means worthy of the substructure. Not being\r\npierced with windows, it seems as if the architect assumed that its\r\nplainness would not be detected in the gloom that in consequence\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nThis building, though small--it is only 53 ft. square externally, and\r\nwith an internal apartment only 34 ft. 6 in. in plan--marks the\r\nculminating point of the Pathan style in Delhi. Nothing so complete had\r\nbeen done before, nothing so ornate was attempted by them afterwards. In\r\nthe provinces wonderful buildings were erected between this period and\r\nthe Mogul conquest, but in the capital their edifices were more marked\r\nby solemn gloom and nakedness than by ornamentation or any of the higher\r\ngraces of architectural art. Externally it is a good deal damaged, but\r\nits effect is still equal to that of any building of its class in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nAJMIR.\r\n\r\nThe mosque at Ajmir (Woodcut No. 283) was commenced apparently in the\r\nyear 1200 and was certainly completed during the reign of Altumsh, A.D.\r\n1211-1236.[504] According to tradition, it was finished in two days and\r\na half; hence the only name by which it is now known--the “Arhai dîn ka\r\nJhompra,” which, if it means anything, can only apply to the clearing\r\naway of the Pagan temples and symbols, and the dedication of a heathen\r\nshrine to purposes of the Faithful. In this instance it seems almost\r\ncertain, whatever may be the case at Delhi, that the pillars are _in\r\nsitu_. At all events, if they were taken down by the Mahomedans, they\r\ncertainly have been re-erected exactly as they were originally designed\r\nto stand.[505] The pillars, their architraves, the roofing stones, and\r\nthe domes, are all of a piece, and so exactly what we find at Abu and\r\nGirnar as to leave no doubt that we see before us a part of the\r\ncourtyard of a Jaina Temple, which probably had been used by the\r\nfollowers of that religion for a couple of centuries at least before it\r\nwas appropriated by the conquerors. It is only the west side, with its\r\nnine domes, that is now standing. The cloisters on the other three sides\r\nare in ruins, though their plan can easily be traced even now. What\r\nremains, however, is sufficient to show that it must originally have\r\nbeen a singularly elegant specimen of its class. The pillars are taller\r\nand more slender than those of the mosque at Delhi, but purer and more\r\nelegant in design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 283. Mosque at Ajmir. (Compiled from a Plan by Gen.\r\nCunningham.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe glory, however, of this mosque, as of that of the Kutub, is the\r\nscreen of seven arches with which Altumsh adorned the courtyard (Woodcut\r\nNo. 284). Its dimensions are very similar to those of its rival. The\r\ncentral arch is 22 ft. 3 in. wide; the two on either side 13 ft. 6 in.,\r\nand the outer one at each end 10 ft. 4 in. In the centre the screen\r\nrises to a height of 56 ft., and on it are the ruins of two small\r\nminarets 10½ ft. in diameter, ornamented with alternate circular and\r\nangular flutes, as in the lower storey of the Kutub. It is not clear\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 284. Great Arch in Mosque at Ajmir. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nwhether anything of the same sort existed at Delhi--probably not, as the\r\ngreat minar may have served for that purpose, and their introduction\r\nhere looks like an afterthought, and the production of an unpractised\r\nhand working in an unfamiliar style. Wherever and whenever minars were\r\nafterwards introduced, preparations for them were always made from the\r\nfoundations, and their lines are always carried down to the ground, in\r\nsome shape or other, as in true art they ought to be. This solecism, if\r\nit may be so called, evidently arose from the architects being Hindus,\r\nunfamiliar with the style; and to this also is due the fact that all the\r\narches are constructed on the horizontal principle. There is not a true\r\narch in the place; but, owing to their having the command of larger\r\nstones than were available at Delhi, the arches are not here crippled,\r\nas they were there before the late repairs.\r\n\r\nIt is neither, however, its dimensions nor design that makes this screen\r\none of the most remarkable architectural objects in India, but the mode\r\nin which it is decorated. Nothing can exceed the taste with which the\r\nCufic and Togra inscriptions are interwoven with the more purely\r\narchitectural decorations, or the manner in which they give life and\r\nvariety to the whole, without ever interfering with the constructive\r\nlines of the design. As before remarked, as examples of\r\nsurface-decoration, these two mosques of Altumsh at Delhi and Ajmir are\r\nprobably unrivalled. Nothing in Cairo or in Persia is so exquisite in\r\ndetail, and nothing in Spain or Syria can approach them for beauty of\r\nsurface-decoration. Besides this, they are unique. Nowhere else would it\r\nbe possible to find Mahomedan largeness of conception, combined with\r\nHindu delicacy of ornamentation, carried out to the same extent and in\r\nthe same manner. If to this we add their historical value as the first\r\nmosques erected in India, and their ethnographic importance as bringing\r\nout the leading characteristics of the two races in so distinct and\r\nmarked a manner, there are certainly no two buildings in India that\r\nbetter deserve the protecting care of Government; the one has received\r\nits fair share of attention; the other has been most shamefully\r\nneglected, and latterly most barbarously ill-treated.[506]\r\n\r\n\r\nLATER PATHAN STYLE.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Ala ud-dîn (A.D. 1316) a change seems to have come\r\nover the spirit of the Pathan architects, and all their subsequent\r\nbuildings, down to the time of Shere Shah, A.D. 1539, exhibit a stern\r\nsimplicity of design, in marked contrast to the elaborate ornamentation\r\nwith which they began. It is not clear whether this arose from any\r\npuritanical reaction against the quasi-Hinduism of the earlier examples,\r\nor from any political causes, the effect of which it is now difficult to\r\ntrace: but, certain it is, that when that stern old warrior Tugluck\r\nShah, A.D. 1321, founded the New Delhi, which still bears his\r\nname--Tugluckabad--all his buildings are characterised by a severe\r\nsimplicity, in marked contrast with those which his predecessors erected\r\nin the capital that overlooks the plain in which his citadel is\r\nsituated. His tomb, which was finished at least, if not built, by his\r\nsuccessor, instead of being situated in a garden, as is usually the\r\ncase, stands by itself in a strongly-fortified citadel of its own,\r\nsurrounded by an artificial lake. The sloping walls and almost Egyptian\r\nsolidity of this mausoleum, combined with the bold and massive towers of\r\nthe fortifications that surround it, form a model of a warrior’s tomb\r\nhardly to be rivalled anywhere, and in singular contrast with the\r\nelegant and luxuriant garden-tombs of the more settled and peaceful\r\ndynasties that succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe change, however, of most interest from a historical point of view\r\nis, that by the time of Tugluck Shah’s reign, the Moslems had worked\r\nthemselves entirely free from Hindu influence. In his buildings all the\r\narches are true arches; all the details invented for the place where\r\nthey are found. His tomb, in fact, would be as appropriate--more so,\r\nindeed--if found in the valley of the Nile than on the banks of the\r\nJumna; and from that time forward Mahomedan architecture in India was a\r\nnew and complete style in itself, and developed according to the natural\r\nand inevitable sequences of true styles in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is true, nevertheless, that in their tombs, as well as in their\r\nmosques, they frequently, to save themselves trouble, used Hindu\r\nmaterials when they were available, and often with the most picturesque\r\neffect. Many of these compound edifices are composed of four pillars\r\nonly, surmounted by a small dome; but frequently they adopt with the\r\npillars the Jaina arrangement of twelve pillars, so placed as to support\r\nan octagonal framework, easily moulded into a circular basement for a\r\ndome. This, as before observed, is the arrangement of the tomb at\r\nMylassa, and the formative idea of all that is beautiful in the plans of\r\nJaina buildings in India.\r\n\r\nOne example must suffice to explain the effect of these buildings\r\n(Woodcut No. 285). At first sight the dome looks rather heavy for the\r\nsubstructure; but the effect of the whole is so picturesque that it is\r\ndifficult to find fault with it. If all the materials were original, the\r\ndesign would be open to criticism; but, when a portion is avowedly\r\nborrowed, a slight want of balance between the parts may be excused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 285. Pathan Tomb at Shepree, near Gualior. (From a Sketch\r\nby the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThere are several examples of tombs of this sort at the Bakaraya Kund in\r\nBenares, evidently made up from Jaina materials;[507] and, indeed,\r\nwherever the Mahomedans fairly settled themselves on a site previously\r\noccupied by the Jains, such combinations are frequent; but no attempt is\r\never made to assimilate the parts that are Mahomedan with those\r\nbelonging to the Hindu style which they are employing; they are of the\r\nage in which the tomb or mosque was built, and that age, consequently,\r\neasily recognisable by any one familiar with the style.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of a Pathan tomb will be better understood from the\r\nfollowing woodcut (No. 286), representing a nameless sepulchre among the\r\nhundreds that still strew the plains of Old Delhi. It consists of an\r\noctagonal apartment, about 50 ft. in diameter, surrounded by a verandah\r\nfollowing the same form, each face being ornamented by three arches of\r\nthe stilted pointed form generally adopted by the Pathans, and it is\r\nsupported by double square columns, which are almost as universal with\r\nthem as this form of arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 286. Tomb at Old Delhi. (From a Sketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nIt is a form evidently borrowed from the square pier of the Jains, but\r\nso altered and so simplified, that it requires some ingenuity to\r\nrecognise its origin in its new combination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 287. Tomb of Shere Shah at Sasseram. No scale.]\r\n\r\nThe series of Pathan tombs closes with that of Shere Shah (Woodcut No.\r\n287), the last but one and the most illustrious of his race. It is\r\nsituated on a square terrace in the middle of a large tank, near\r\nSasseram, in Shahabad, and, from its locality and its design, is now a\r\nsingularly picturesque object (Woodcut No. 288). Its dimensions too are\r\nconsiderable.[508] Its base is an octagon, 54 ft. on each side\r\nexternally. In the interior a gallery, 10 ft. wide, surrounds the\r\ncentral apartment, which is surmounted by a dome 65 ft. in diameter,\r\nbeneath which stands the tomb of the founder and of some of his\r\nfavourite companions in arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 288. Tomb of Shere Shah. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nOn the exterior, the terrace on which it stands is ornamented by bold\r\noctagonal pavilions in the angles, which support appropriately the\r\ncentral dome, and the little bracketed kiosks between them break\r\npleasingly the outline. In the same manner the octagonal kiosks that\r\ncluster round the drum of the dome, and the dome itself, relieve the\r\nmonotony of the composition without detracting from its solidity or\r\napparent solemnity. Altogether, as a royal tomb of the second class,\r\nthere are few that surpass it in India, either for beauty of outline or\r\nappropriateness of detail. Originally it was connected with the mainland\r\nby a bridge, which fortunately was broken down before the grand trunk\r\nroad passed near. But for this, it would probably have been utilised\r\nbefore now.\r\n\r\nThe mosques of the Pathans bore the same aspect as their tombs. The\r\nso-called Kala Musjid in the present city of Delhi, and finished,\r\naccording to an inscription on its walls, in A.D. 1389, is in a style\r\nnot unlike the tomb (Woodcut No. 286), but more massive, and even less\r\nornamented. This severe simplicity seems to have been the characteristic\r\nof the latter part of the 14th century, and may have been a protest of\r\nthe more puritanical Moslem spirit against the Hindu exuberance which\r\ncharacterised both the 13th and the 15th centuries. A reaction, however,\r\ntook place, and the late Pathan style of Delhi was hardly less rich, and\r\ncertainly far more appropriate for the purposes to which it was devoted\r\nthan the first style, as exhibited in the buildings at the Kutub.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was principally owing to the exceptional splendour of the\r\nreign of Shere Shah, who, however, is so mixed up both in date and in\r\nassociation with the earlier Moguls, that it is difficult to\r\ndiscriminate between them. Though Baber practically conquered India in\r\nA.D. 1494, his successor, Humayun, was defeated and driven from the\r\nthrone by Shere Shah in A.D. 1540, and it was only in A.D. 1554 that the\r\nMogul dynasty was finally and securely established at Delhi. The style\r\nconsequently of the first half of the 16th century may be considered as\r\nthe last expiring effort of the Pathans, or the first dawn of that of\r\nthe great Moguls, and it was well worthy of either.\r\n\r\nAt this age the façades of these mosques became far more ornamental, and\r\nmore frequently encrusted with marbles, and always adorned with\r\nsculpture of a rich and beautiful character; the angles of the buildings\r\nwere also relieved by little kiosks, supported by four richly bracketed\r\npillars, but never with minarets, which, so far as I know, were not\r\nattached to mosques during the Pathan period. The call to prayer was\r\nmade from the roof; and, except the first rude attempt at Ajmir, I do\r\nnot know a single instance of a minaret built for such a purpose, though\r\nthey were, as we know, universal in Egypt and elsewhere long before this\r\ntime, and were considered nearly indispensable in the buildings of the\r\nMoguls very shortly afterwards. The Pathans seem to have regarded the\r\nminar as the Italians viewed the Campanile, more as a symbol of power\r\nand of victory than as an adjunct to a house of worship.\r\n\r\nThe body of the mosque became generally an oblong hall, with a central\r\ndome flanked by two others of the same horizontal dimensions, but not so\r\nlofty, and separated from it by a broad bold arch, the mouldings and\r\ndecorations of which formed one of the principal ornaments of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe pendentives were even more remarkable than the arches for\r\nelaborateness of detail. Their forms are so various that it is\r\nimpossible to classify or describe them; perhaps the most usual is that\r\nrepresented in Woodcut No. 289, where the angle is filled up with a\r\nnumber of small imitations of arches, bracketing out one beyond the\r\nother. It was this form that was afterwards converted into the honeycomb\r\nwork of the Arabs in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 289. Pendentive from Mosque at Old Delhi. (From a Sketch\r\nby the Author.)]\r\n\r\nIf it were not that the buildings of the Pathans are so completely\r\neclipsed by the greater splendour of those of the Mogul dynasty, which\r\nsucceeded them in their own capitals, their style would have attracted\r\nmore attention than has hitherto been bestowed upon it; and its\r\nmonograph would be as interesting as any that the Indian-Saracenic\r\naffords. In its first period the style was characterised by all the\r\nrichness which Hindu elaboration could bestow; in the second by a stern\r\nsimplicity and grandeur much more appropriate, according to our ideas,\r\nto the spirit of the people; and during the latter part of its\r\nexistence, by a return to the elaborateness of the past; but at this\r\nperiod every detail was fitted to its place and its purpose. We forget\r\nthe Hindu except in his delicacy, and we recognise in this last\r\ndevelopment one of the completed architectural styles of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nJAUNPORE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nMosques of Jumma Musjid and Lall Durwaza.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nKhoja Jehan assumes independence at Jaunpore      A.D. 1397\r\nMubarick, his son                                      1400\r\nShems ud-dîn--Ibrahim Shah                             1401\r\nMahmúd                                                 1441\r\nHusain Shah                                            1451\r\n---- deposed and seeks refuge at Gaur                  1478\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just two centuries after the conquest of India by the Moslems\r\nthat Khoja Jehan, the Soubahdar or governor of the province in which\r\nJaunpore is situated, assumed independence, and established a dynasty\r\nwhich maintained itself for nearly a century, from A.D. 1397 to about\r\n1478, and though then reconquered by the sovereign of Delhi, still\r\nretained a sort of semi-independence till finally incorporated in the\r\nMogul empire by the great Akbar. During this period Jaunpore was adorned\r\nby several large mosques, three of which still remain tolerably entire,\r\nand a considerable number of tombs, palaces, and other buildings,\r\nbesides a fort and bridge, all of which are as remarkable specimens of\r\ntheir class of architecture as are to be found anywhere in India.\r\n\r\nAlthough so long after the time when under Ala ud-dîn and Tugluck Shah\r\nthe architecture of the capital had assumed something like completeness,\r\nit is curious to observe how imperfect the amalgamation was in the\r\nprovinces at the time when the principal buildings at Jaunpore were\r\nerected. The principal parts of the mosques, such as the gateways, the\r\ngreat halls, and the western parts generally, are in a complete arcuate\r\nstyle. Wherever indeed wide openings and large internal spaces were\r\nwanted, arches and domes and radiating vaults were employed, and there\r\nis little in those parts to distinguish this architecture from that of\r\nthe capitals. But in the cloisters that surround the courts, and in the\r\ngalleries in the interior, short square pillars are as generally\r\nemployed, with bracket capitals, horizontal architraves, and roofs\r\nformed of flat slabs, as was invariably the case in Hindu and Jaina\r\ntemples. Instead of being fused together, as they afterwards became, the\r\narcuate style of the Moslems stands here, though in juxtaposition, in\r\nsuch marked contrast to the trabeate style of the Hindus, that some\r\nauthors have been led to suppose that the pillared parts belonged to\r\nancient Jaina or Buddhist monuments, which had been appropriated by the\r\nMahomedans and converted to their purposes.[509] The truth of the matter\r\nappears to be, that the greater part of the Mahomedans in the province\r\nat the time the mosques were built were Hindus converted to that\r\nreligion, and who still clung to their native forms when these did not\r\nclash with their new faith; and the masons were almost certainly those\r\nwhose traditions and whose taste inclined them much more to the old\r\ntrabeate forms than to the newly-introduced arched style.\r\n\r\nAs we shall presently see at Gaur, on the one hand, the arched style\r\nprevailed from the first, because the builders had no other material\r\nthan brick, and large openings were then impossible without arches. At\r\nAhmedabad, on the other hand, in an essentially Jaina country, and where\r\nstone was abundant, the pillared forms were not only as commonly\r\nemployed, as at Jaunpore, but were used for so long a time, that before\r\nthe country was absorbed in the Mogul empire, the amalgamation between\r\nthe trabeate and arcuate forms was complete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe oldest mosque at Jaunpore is that in the fort, which we learn from\r\nan inscription on it, was completed in A.D. 1398. It is not\r\nlarge--barely 100 ft. north and south--and consists of a central block\r\nof masonry, with a large archway, of the usual style of the Mahomedan\r\narchitecture of the period, and five openings between pillars on either\r\nhand. The front rows of these pillars are richly sculptured, and were\r\nevidently taken from some temple that existed there, or in the\r\nneighbourhood, before the Moslem occupation, but they seem to have\r\nexhausted the stock, as no other such are found in any of the mosques\r\nbuilt subsequently.[510]\r\n\r\nThere are three great mosques still standing in the city; of these the\r\ngrandest is the Jumma Musjid (Woodcuts Nos. 290, 291), or Friday\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 290. Plan of Western Half of Courtyard of Jumma Musjid,\r\nJaunpore. (From a Plan by the Author.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 291. View of lateral Gateway of Jumma Musjid, Jaunpore.\r\n(From a Drawing by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nMosque, which was commenced by Shah Ibrahim, A.D. 1419, but not\r\ncompleted till the reign of Husain, A.D. 1451-1478. It consists of a\r\ncourtyard 220 ft. by 214 ft., on the western side of which is situated a\r\nrange of buildings, the central one covered by a dome 40 ft. in\r\ndiameter,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 292. Lall Durwaza Mosque, Jaunpore. (From a Drawing by\r\nthe Author.)]\r\n\r\nin front of which stands a gate pyramid or _propylon_,[511] of almost\r\nEgyptian mass and outline, rising to the height of 86 ft. This gate\r\npyramid by its elevation supplied the place of a minaret, which is a\r\nfeature as little known at Jaunpore, as it was, at the same age, in the\r\ncapital city of Delhi. On each side of the dome is a compartment divided\r\ninto two storeys by a stone floor supported on pillars; and beyond this,\r\non each side, is an apartment 40 ft. by 50 ft., covered by a bold\r\npointed vault with ribs, so constructed that its upper surface forms the\r\nexternal roof of the building, which in Gothic vaults is scarcely ever\r\nthe case. The three sides of the courtyard were surrounded by double\r\ncolonnades, two storeys in height internally, but with three on the\r\nexterior, the floor of the courtyard being raised to the height of the\r\nlower storey. On each face was a handsome gateway; one of which is\r\nrepresented in Woodcut No. 291, which gives a fair idea of the style:\r\nthe greater part of the eastern side of the court has been taken down\r\nand removed by the English to repair station-roads and bridges, for\r\nwhich in their estimation these pillars are admirably adapted.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the mosques in the city is the Lall Durwaza or Red Gate.\r\nIt is in the same style as the others; and its propylon--represented in\r\nWoodcut No. 292--displays not only the bold massiveness with which these\r\nmosques were erected, but shows also that strange admixture of Hindu and\r\nMahomedan architecture which pervaded the style during the whole period\r\nof its continuance.\r\n\r\nOf all the mosques remaining at Jaunpore, the Atala Musjid is the most\r\nornate and the most beautiful. The colonnades surrounding its court are\r\nfour aisles in depth, the outer columns, as well as those next the\r\ncourt, being double square pillars. The three intermediate rows are\r\nsingle square columns, supporting a flat roof of slabs, arranged as in\r\nJaina temples. Externally, too, it is two storeys in height, the lower\r\nstorey being occupied by a series of cells opening outwardly. All this\r\nis so like a Hindu arrangement that one might almost at first sight be\r\ntempted, like Baron Hügel, to fancy it was originally a Buddhist\r\nmonastery. He failed to remark, however, that both here and in the Jumma\r\nMusjid the cells open outwardly, and are below the level of the\r\ncourtyard of the mosque--an arrangement common enough in Mahomedan, but\r\nnever found in Buddhist buildings. Its gateways, however, which are the\r\nprincipal ornaments of the outer court, are purely Saracenic, and the\r\nwestern face is adorned by three propylons similar to that represented\r\nin the last woodcut, but richer and more beautiful, while its interior\r\ndomes and roofs are superior to any other specimen of Mahomedan art I am\r\nacquainted with of so early an age. They are, too, perhaps, more\r\nstriking here, because, though in juxtaposition with the quasi-Hinduism\r\nof the court, they exhibit the arched style of the Saracenic architects\r\nin as great a degree of completeness as it exhibited at any subsequent\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe other buildings hardly require particular mention, though, as\r\ntransition specimens between the two styles, these Jaunpore examples are\r\nwell worthy of illustration, and in themselves possess a simplicity and\r\ngrandeur not often met with in this style. An appearance of strength,\r\nmoreover, is imparted to them by their sloping walls, which is foreign\r\nto our general conception of Saracenic art, though at Tugluckabad and\r\nelsewhere it is carried even further than at Jaunpore. Among the Pathans\r\nof India the expression of strength is as characteristic of the style as\r\nmassiveness is of that of the Normans in England. In India it is found\r\nconjoined with a degree of refinement seldom met with elsewhere, and\r\ntotally free from the coarseness which in other countries usually besets\r\nvigour and boldness of design.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of this style are by no means confined to the capital;\r\nthey prevail at Gazeepore, and as far north as Canouge, while at Benares\r\nthe examples are frequent. In the suburbs of that city, at a place\r\ncalled the Bakaraya Kund,[512] there is a group of tombs, as mentioned\r\nabove, and other buildings belonging to the Moslems, which are\r\nsingularly pleasing specimens of the Jaunpore style, and certainly\r\nbelong to the same age as those just described.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Jaunpore is also rich in little tombs and shrines in\r\nwhich the Moslems have used up Hindu and Jaina pillars, merely\r\nrearranging them after their own fashion. These, of course, will not\r\nbear criticism as architectural designs, but there is always something\r\nso indescribably picturesque about them as fairly to extort admiration.\r\nThe principal example of this compound style is a mosque at Canouge,\r\nknown popularly as “Sita ka Rasui,” “Sita’s kitchen.” It is a Jaina\r\ntemple, rearranged as a mosque, in the manner described at pp. 263-4. It\r\nmeasures externally 133 ft. by 120 ft. The mosque itself has four rows\r\nof fifteen columns each, and three domes. The cloisters surrounding the\r\ncourt are only two rows in depth, and had originally sixty-eight\r\npillars, smaller than those of the mosque. Externally it has no great\r\nbeauty, but its pillared court is very picturesque and pleasing.\r\nAccording to an inscription over its principal gateway, its conversion\r\nwas effected by Ibrahim Shah, of Jaunpore, A.D. 1406.[513]\r\n\r\nAt a later age, and even after it had lost its independence, several\r\nimportant buildings were erected in the capital and in other towns of\r\nthe kingdom in the style of the day; but none of these, so far as is now\r\nknown, are of sufficient importance to require notice in such a work as\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGUJERAT.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nJumma Musjid and other Mosques at Ahmedabad--Tombs and Mosques at Sirkej\r\nand Butwa--Buildings in the Provinces.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nMuzaffar Shah, a Rajput, appointed Viceroy             A.D. 1391\r\nAhmed Shah, his grandson, founds Ahmedabad                  1411\r\nMohammed Shah the Merciful                                  1443\r\nKutub Shah; war with Rana Khumbo                            1454\r\nMahmúd Shah Begurra                                         1459\r\nMuzaffar Shah II.                                           1511\r\nBahadur Shah murdered by Portuguese                         1526\r\nMuzaffar Shah III.                                          1561\r\nGujerat becomes a province of Akbar’s kingdom               1583\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the various forms which the Saracenic architecture assumed in India,\r\nthat of Ahmedabad may probably be considered as the most elegant, as it\r\ncertainly is the most characteristic of all. No other form is so\r\nessentially Indian, and no one tells its tale with the same unmistakable\r\ndistinctness.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the Mahomedans, in the first century of the Hejira,\r\nmade a brilliant attempt to conquer Scinde and Gujerat, and apparently\r\nsucceeded; but the country was so populous, and its civilization so\r\ngreat, that the invaders were absorbed, and soon disappeared from the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nMahmúd of Ghazni next overran the province, but left no permanent mark;\r\nand even after the fall of Delhi (A.D. 1196) Gujerat maintained the\r\nstruggle for independence for nearly two centuries longer, till Feroze\r\nTugluck, in A.D. 1391, appointed Muzaffar, a converted Rajput, of the\r\nTak clan, to be his viceroy. This, however, was only on the eve of the\r\ntroubles caused by the invasion of Tamerlane, and, _mutato domino_,\r\nGujerat remained as independent as before.\r\n\r\nThe next two centuries--during which the Ahmed Shahi dynasty occupied\r\nthe throne--were spent in continual wars and struggles with their\r\nrefractory vassals and the neighbouring chiefs. On the whole, however,\r\ntheir power may be said to have been gradually on the increase till the\r\ndeath of Bahadur, A.D. 1536, but they never wholly subdued the\r\nrebellious spirit of their subjects, and certainly never converted the\r\nbulk of them to their faith. As a consequence of this, the principal\r\nbuildings with which this chapter is concerned are to be found in the\r\ncapital and its immediate proximity. Beyond that the Hindus followed\r\ntheir old faith and built temples as before; though in such large cities\r\nas Cambay or Baroach the Mahomedans, of course, possessed places of\r\nworship, some of them of considerable importance, and generally made up\r\nfrom pillars borrowed from Hindu buildings.\r\n\r\nIn Ahmedabad itself, however, the Hindu influence continued to be felt\r\nthroughout. Even the mosques are Hindu, or rather Jaina, in every\r\ndetail; only here and there an arch is inserted, not because it was\r\nwanted constructively, but because it was a symbol of the faith, while\r\nin their tombs and palaces even this is generally wanting. The truth of\r\nthe matter is, the Mahomedans had forced themselves upon the most\r\ncivilized and most essentially building race at that time in India, and\r\nthe Chalukyas conquered their conquerors, and forced them to adopt forms\r\nand ornaments which were superior to any the invaders knew or could have\r\nintroduced. The result is a style which combines all the elegance and\r\nfinish of Jaina or Chalukyan art, with a certain largeness of conception\r\nwhich the Hindu never quite attained, but which is characteristic of the\r\npeople who at this time were subjecting all India to their sway.\r\n\r\nThe first seat of the Mahomedan power was Anhilwarra, the old capital of\r\nthe Rajputs, and which, at the time it fell into their power, must have\r\nbeen one of the most splendid cities of the East. Little now remains of\r\nall its magnificence, if we may trust what is said by recent travellers\r\nwho have visited its deserted palaces. Ahmed, the second king, removed\r\nthe seat of power to a town called Kurnawutti, afterwards known as\r\nAhmedabad, from the name of its second founder, and which, with\r\ncharacteristic activity, he set about adorning with splendid edifices.\r\nOf these the principal was the Jumma Musjid, which, though not\r\nremarkable for its size, is one of the most beautiful mosques in the\r\nEast. Its arrangement will be understood from the next plan (Woodcut No.\r\n293). Its dimensions are 382 ft. by 258 ft. over all externally; the\r\nmosque itself being 210 ft. by 95 ft., covering consequently about\r\n20,000 sq. ft. Within the mosque itself are 260 pillars, supporting\r\nfifteen domes arranged symmetrically, the centre three alone being\r\nsomewhat larger and considerably higher than the others. If the plan is\r\ncompared with that of the temple at Sadri (Woodcut No. 133), which was\r\nbeing erected at the same time by Khumbo Rana within 160 miles of\r\nAhmedabad, it will afford a fair means of comparison between the Jaina\r\nand Mahomedan arrangements of that day. The form of the pillars and the\r\ndetails generally are practically the same in both buildings, the Hindu\r\nbeing somewhat richer and more elaborate. In plan, the mosque looks\r\nmonotonous as compared with the temple; but this is redeemed, to some\r\nextent, by the different heights of the domes, as shown in the elevation\r\n(Woodcut No. 294), and by the elevation of each division being\r\nstudiously varied. My own feeling is in favour of the poetry of the\r\ntemple, but there is a sobriety about the plan of the mosque which,\r\nafter all, may be in better taste. Both plans, it need hardly be\r\nremarked, are infinitely superior to the monotony of the southern halls\r\nof 1000 pillars. The latter are remarkable for their size and the amount\r\nof labour bestowed upon them, but it requires more than this to\r\nconstitute good architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 293. Plan of Jumma Musjid, Ahmedabad. Scale 100 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 294. Elevation of the Jumma Musjid. Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nThe general character of the elevation will be understood from the\r\nwoodcut No. 294, but unfortunately its minarets are gone. When\r\nForbes[514] drew it, they were still standing, and were celebrated in\r\nEastern story as the shaking minarets of Ahmedabad; an earthquake in\r\nA.D. 1818 shook them too much, but there are several others still\r\nstanding in the city from which their form can easily be restored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 295. Plan of the Queen’s Mosque, Mirzapore. Scale 50 ft.\r\nto 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 296. Elevation of the Queen’s Mosque, Mirzapore. Scale 50\r\nft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 297. Section of Diagram explanatory of the Mosques at\r\nAhmedabad.]\r\n\r\nThe plan and lateral extension of the Jumma Musjid are exceptional. The\r\nusual form taken by the mosques at Ahmedabad was that of the Queen’s\r\nMosque at Mirzapore, and consists of three domes standing on twelve\r\npillars each, with the central part so raised as to admit light to the\r\ninterior. The mode in which this was effected will be understood from\r\nthe annexed diagram (Woodcut No. 297). The pillars which support the\r\ncentral domes are twice as high as those of the side domes, and two rows\r\nof dwarf columns stand on the roof to make up the height. In front of\r\nthese internally is a solid balustrade, which is generally most richly\r\nornamented by carving. Thus arranged, it will be perceived that the\r\nnecessary amount of light is introduced, as in the drum of a Byzantine\r\ndome, but in a more artistic manner. The sun’s rays can never fall on\r\nthe floor, or even so low as the head of any one standing there. The\r\nlight is reflected from the external roof into the dome, and perfect\r\nventilation is obtained, with the most pleasing effect of illumination\r\nwithout glare. In order further to guard against the last dreaded\r\ncontingency, in most of these mosques a screen of perforated stonework\r\nwas introduced between the outer dwarf columns. These screens were\r\nfrequently of the most exquisite beauty, and in consequence have very\r\ngenerally been removed.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four mosques at Ahmedabad, built on the same pattern\r\nas that last described, but as the style progressed it became more and\r\nmore Indian. The arches in front were frequently omitted, and only a\r\nscreen of columns appeared, supported by two minarets, one at each\r\nangle. This system was carried to its greatest extent at Sirkej, about\r\nfive miles from the city. Mohammed Shah, in A.D. 1445, commenced\r\nerecting a tomb (A on Woodcut No. 298) here, in honour of Ahmed Gunj\r\nBuksh, the friend and adviser of his father. The style of these\r\nbuildings may be judged of from the woodcut (No. 299, page 532),\r\nrepresenting the pavilion of sixteen pillars in front of this tomb (I in\r\nWoodcut No. 298). They are of the usual simple outline of the style--a\r\ntall, square base; the shafts square, and with no ornament except a\r\ncountersinking on the angles, and crowned with a moderately projecting\r\nbracket-capital. The building is roofed with nine small domes,\r\ninsignificant in themselves, but both internally and externally forming\r\nas pleasing a mode of roofing as ever was applied to such a small\r\ndetached building of this class. The mosque (D) was completed in A.D.\r\n1451, and Mahmúd Begurra added afterwards a tomb for himself (B) and one\r\nfor his wife Rajbaie (C). With their accompanying palaces and tombs\r\nthese make up one of the most important groups in the neighbourhood. The\r\nwhole are constructed without a single arch; all the pillars have the\r\nusual bracket capitals of the Hindus, and all the domes are on the\r\nhorizontal principle. In the large tomb an attempt has been made to get\r\na larger dome than the usual octagonal arrangement would admit of, but\r\nnot quite successfully. The octagon does not accord with the\r\nsubstructure, and either wider spaces ought to have been introduced or a\r\npolygon of a greater number of sides employed. The mosque is the\r\nperfection of elegant simplicity, and is an improvement on the plan of\r\nthe Jumma Musjid. There are five domes in a line, as there, but they are\r\nplaced nearer to one another, and though of greater diameter the width\r\nof the whole is less, and they are only two ranges in depth. Except the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 298. Plan of Tombs and Mosque at Sirkej. (From a Sketch\r\nby T. C. Hope, Esq.) Scale 100 Ft. to 1 in.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\nA. Tomb of Gunj Buksh.\r\n\r\nB.

Pavilion in front of Tomb at Sirkej.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 300. Mosque at Mooháfiz Khan. Scale 25 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nBesides these larger mosques there are several smaller ones of great\r\nbeauty, of which two--those of Mooháfiz Khan and the Rani Sîpri--are\r\npre-eminent. The elevation of the first is by no means happy, but its\r\ndetails are exquisite, and it retains its minarets, which is too seldom\r\nthe case. As will be seen from the woodcut, as well as from those of the\r\nJumma and Queen’s Mosques (Nos. 294, 296), the lower part of the\r\nminarets is of pure Hindu architecture; all the bases at Ahmedabad are\r\nneither more nor less than the perpendicular parts of the basement of\r\nHindu or Jaina temples elongated. Every form and every detail may be\r\nfound at Chandravati or Abu, except in one particular--on the angles of\r\nall Hindu temples are niches containing images. This the Moslem could\r\nnot tolerate, so he filled them with tracery. We can follow the progress\r\nof the development of this form, from the first rude attempt in the\r\nJumma Musjid, through all its stages to the exquisite patterns of the\r\nQueen’s Mosque at Mirzapore. After a century’s experience they produced\r\nforms which as architectural ornaments will, in their own class, stand\r\ncomparison with any employed in any age or in any part of the world; and\r\nin doing this they invented a class of window-tracery in which they were\r\nalso unrivalled. The specimen below (Woodcut No. 301), from a window in\r\na desecrated mosque in the palace (the Bhudder) will convey an idea of\r\nits elaborateness and grace. It would be difficult to excel the skill\r\nwith which the vegetable forms are conventionalised just to the extent\r\nrequired for the purpose. The equal spacing also of the subject by the\r\nthree ordinary trees and four palms, takes it out of the category of\r\ndirect imitation of nature, and renders it sufficiently structural for\r\nits situation; but perhaps the greatest skill is shown in the even\r\nmanner in which the pattern is spread over the whole surface. There are\r\nsome exquisite specimens of tracery in precious marbles at Agra and\r\nDelhi, but none quite equal to this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 301. Window in Bhudder at Ahmedabad. (From a Photograph\r\nby Colonel Biggs.)]\r\n\r\nAbove the roof of the mosques the minarets are always round towers\r\nslightly tapering, as in the mosque of Mooháfiz Khan (Woodcut No. 300),\r\nrelieved by galleries displaying great richness in the brackets which\r\nsupport them as well as in the balustrades which protect them. The tower\r\nalways terminates in a conical top relieved by various disks. They are,\r\nso far as I know, the only minarets belonging to mosques which surpass\r\nthose of Cairo in beauty of outline or richness of detail, excepting\r\nthose of the Rani Sîpri mosque, which are still more beautiful. Indeed,\r\nthat mosque is the most exquisite gem at Ahmedabad, both in plan and\r\ndetail. It is without arches, and every part is such as only a Hindu\r\nqueen could order, and only Hindu artists could carve.[515]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMBS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 302. Tomb of Meer Abu Touráb. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nKnowing the style, it would not be difficult to predicate the form of\r\nthe tombs. The simplest would be that of Abu Touráb; an octagonal dome\r\nsupported on twelve pillars, and this extended on every side, but always\r\nremaining a square, and the entrances being in the centre of the faces.\r\nThe difference between this and the Jaina arrangement is that the latter\r\nis diagonal (Woodcut No. 119), while these are square. The superiority\r\nof the Hindu mode is apparent at a glance. Not, it is true, in so small\r\nan arrangement as that last quoted, but in the tombs at Sirkej (Woodcut\r\nNo. 298), the effect is so monotonous as almost to become unpleasing.\r\nWith the Jains this never is the case, however numerous the pillars may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 303. Plan and Elevation of Tomb of Syad Osmán. Scale 50\r\nft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nBesides the monotony of the square plan, it was felt at Sirkej--as\r\nalready pointed out--that the octagonal dome fitted awkwardly on to its\r\nsupports. This was remedied, to a great extent, in the tomb of Syad\r\nOsmán, built in A.D. 460 by Mahmúd Begurra. In this instance the base\r\nof the dome is a dodecagon, and a very considerable amount of variety is\r\nobtained by grouping the pillars in twos and fours, and by the different\r\nspacing. In elevation the dome looks heavy for the substructure, but not\r\nso in perspective; and when the screens were added to inclose the\r\ncentral square, it was altogether the most successful sepulchral design\r\ncarried out in the pillared style at Ahmedabad.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of their career, the architects of Ahmedabad evinced a\r\nstrong tendency to revert to the arched forms generally used by their\r\nbrethren in other countries. Mahmúd Begurra built himself a tomb near\r\nKaira, which is wholly in the arched style, and remains one of the most\r\nsplendid sepulchres in India.[516] He also erected at Butwa, near\r\nAhmedabad, a tomb over the grave of a saint, which is in every respect\r\nin the same style. So little, however, were the builders accustomed to\r\narched forms, that, though the plan is judiciously disposed by placing\r\nsmaller arches outside the larger, so as to abut them, still all those\r\nof the outer range have fallen down, and the whole is very much\r\ncrippled, while the tomb without arches, that stands within a few yards\r\nof it, remains entire. The scale of the two, however (Plan No. 305),\r\nreveals the secret of the preference accorded to the arch as a\r\nconstructive expedient. The larger piers, the wider spacing, the whole\r\ndimensions, were on a grander scale than could be attained with beams\r\nonly, as the Hindus used them. As the Greeks and Romans employed these\r\nfeatures, any dimensions that were feasible with arches could be\r\nattained by pillars; but the Hindus worked to a smaller modulus, and do\r\nnot seem to have known how to increase it. It must, however, be remarked\r\nthat they generally used pillars only in courts, where there was nothing\r\nto compare them with but the spectator’s own height; and there the forms\r\nemployed by them were large enough. It was only when the Moslems came to\r\nuse them externally, and in conjunction with arches and other larger\r\nfeatures, that their diminutive scale became apparent.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the evidence of a declining age to find size becoming the\r\nprincipal aim. But it is certainly one great and important ingredient in\r\narchitectural design, and so thought the later architects of Ahmedabad.\r\nIn their later mosques and buildings they attained greater dimensions,\r\nbut it was at the expense of all that renders their earlier style so\r\nbeautiful and so interesting.[517]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 304. Tomb of Kutub-ul-Alum, Butwa. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 305. Plans of Tombs of Kutub-ul-Alum and his Son, Butwa.\r\nScale about 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nBesides the buildings of the classes above enumerated, there are several\r\nsmaller objects of art at Ahmedabad which are of extraordinary beauty.\r\nAmong these are several bowlees, or deep wells, with broad flights of\r\nsteps leading down to them, and ornamented with pillars and galleries to\r\nas great an extent as some of the largest buildings above ground. It\r\nrequires a personal experience of the grateful coolness of a\r\nsubterranean apartment in a hot climate to appreciate such a class of\r\nbuildings, and in the rainy West we hardly know how valuable water may\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nAnother object of architectural beauty is found in the inflow and\r\noutflow sluices of the great tanks which abound everywhere around the\r\ncity. Nowhere did the inhabitants of Ahmedabad show how essentially they\r\nwere an architectural people, as in these utilitarian works. It was a\r\nnecessity of their nature that every object should be made ornamental,\r\nand their success was as great in these as in their mosques or palaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS IN THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the numerous edifices that adorn the capital, there are,\r\nas hinted above, several in the provincial capitals that are well worthy\r\nof notice. Among these the Jumma Musjid at Cambay is perhaps the most\r\nsplendid. It was erected in A.D. 1325, in the time of Mohammed Shah\r\nGori, and is only inferior to that of the capital in size. It measures\r\nover all 200 ft. by 210 ft., and its internal court 120 ft. by 135 ft.\r\nExcept being somewhat smaller in scale, its plan and arrangements are\r\nalmost identical with those of the Altumsh Mosque (Woodcut No. 283) at\r\nAjmir: but, when it is looked into, it would be difficult to conceive\r\ntwo buildings more essentially different than these two are. The screen\r\nof arches at Cambay, only three in number, are plain even to baldness,\r\nand low, in order to fit the dimensions of the Jaina pillars of the\r\ninterior. These latter are all borrowed from desecrated temples, and in\r\nthis instance certainly rearranged without much attention to congruity\r\nor architectural effect. Still the effect is picturesque, and the parts\r\nbeing employed for the purposes for which they were designed, there is\r\nno offensive incongruity anywhere.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features in this mosque is the tomb, which\r\nits founder, Imrar ben Ahmed Kajerani erected for himself. It is wholly\r\ncomposed of Hindu remains, and is two storeys in height, and was crowned\r\nwith a dome 28 ft. in diameter. The parts, however--borrowed,\r\napparently, from different buildings--were so badly fitted together\r\nthat, after standing some three centuries, it fell in, and has since\r\nremained a ruin, singularly picturesque in form and exquisite in detail,\r\nbut a monument of the folly of employing building materials for any\r\npurpose but that for which they were designed.[518]\r\n\r\nThere is another mosque at Baroach, not unlike this one in design but\r\nsmaller, being only 135 ft. over all north and south, and it has--now,\r\nat least--no courtyard; but some of its details, borrowed from Hindu\r\ntemples, are very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere are also two very beautiful mosques at Dolka, a city twenty-two\r\nmiles south-west from Ahmedabad, almost identical in size and plan,\r\nbeing each of them squares of about 150 ft., and the mosque-front\r\ncovered with five domes and the screen-wall with three arches each.[519]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 306. Plan of Tomb of Mahmúd Begurra, near Kaira. Scale 50\r\nft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 307. Tomb of Mahmúd Begurra, near Kaira. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful, however, of these provincial examples is the tomb at\r\nMahmúdabad, of its class one of the most beautiful in India (Woodcut No.\r\n306). It was erected by the same Mahmúd Begurra, A.D. 1484, who erected\r\nthe tomb of Kutub-ul-Alum at Butwa, described above (Woodcut No. 304),\r\nand is said to have been designed by the same architect. This is,\r\nhowever, a far more successful example, and though small--it is only 94\r\nft. square, exclusive of the porch--there is a simplicity about its\r\nplan, a solidity and balance of parts in the design, which is not always\r\nfound in these tombs, and has rarely, if ever, been surpassed in any\r\ntomb in India. The details, too, are all elegant and appropriate, so\r\nthat it only wants somewhat increased dimensions to rank among the very\r\nfirst of its class. Its constructive arrangements, too, are so perfect\r\nthat no alterations in them would be required, if the scale had been\r\nvery much increased.\r\n\r\nThe tomb itself is surrounded by a screen of perforated stonework, of\r\nthe very finest tracery, and with its double verandah aids in giving the\r\nsepulchral chamber that seclusion and repose so indispensable in a\r\nmausoleum.[520]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMALWA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nThe Great Mosque at Mandu.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nSultan Dilawar Ghori                            A.D. 1401\r\nSultan Hoshang Ghori                                 1405\r\nGhazni Khan                                          1432\r\nMahmúd Khan, cotemp.

It is,\r\nhowever, to his successor Hoshang, that Mandu owes its greatness and all\r\nthe finest of its buildings. The state continued to prosper as one of\r\nthe independent Moslem principalities till A.D. 1534, when it was\r\nincorporated with Gujerat, and was finally annexed to Akbar’s dominion\r\nin A.D. 1568.\r\n\r\nThe original capital of the state was Dhar, an old Hindu city, twenty\r\nmiles northward of Mandu, to which the seat of government was\r\ntransferred after it became independent. Though an old and venerated\r\ncity of the Hindus, Dhar contains no evidence of its former greatness,\r\nexcept two mosques erected wholly of Jaina remains. The principal of\r\nthese, the Jumma Musjid, has a courtyard measuring 102 ft. north and\r\nsouth, by 131 ft. in the other direction. The mosque itself is 119 ft.\r\nby 40 ft. 6 in., and its roof is supported by sixty-four pillars of\r\nJaina architecture, 12 ft. 6 in. in height, and all of them more or less\r\nrichly carved, and the three domes that adorn it are also of purely\r\nHindu form. The court is surrounded by an arcade containing forty-four\r\ncolumns, 10 ft. in height, but equally rich in carving. There is here no\r\nscreen of arches, as at the Kutub or at Ajmir. Internally nothing is\r\nvisible but Hindu pillars, and, except for their disposition and the\r\nprayer-niches that adorn the western wall, it might be taken for a Hindu\r\nbuilding. In this instance, however, there seems no doubt that there is\r\nnothing _in situ_. The pillars have been brought from desecrated temples\r\nin the town, and arranged here by the Mahomedans as we now find them,\r\nprobably before the transference of the capital to Mandu.\r\n\r\nThe other mosque is similar to this one, and only slightly smaller. It\r\nhas long, however, ceased to be used as a place of prayer, and is sadly\r\nout of repair. It is called the Lât Musjid, from an iron pillar now\r\nlying half-buried in front of its gateway. This is generally supposed to\r\nhave been a pillar of victory, like that at the Kutub; but this can\r\nhardly be the case. If it were intended for an ornamental purpose, it\r\nwould have been either round or octagonal, and had some ornamental form.\r\nAs it is, it is only a square bar of iron, some 20 ft. or 25 ft. in\r\nheight, and 9 in. section, without any ornamental form whatever. My\r\nimpression is, that it was used for some useful constructive purpose,\r\nlike those which supported the false roof in the Pagoda at Kanaruc\r\n(_ante_, page 428). There are some holes through it, which tend further\r\nto make this view of its origin probable. But, be this as it may, it is\r\nanother curious proof of the employment of large masses of wrought-iron\r\nby the Hindus at a time when they were supposed to be incapable of any\r\nsuch mechanical exertion. Its date is probably that of the pillars of\r\nthe mosques where it is found, and from their style they probably belong\r\nto the 10th or 11th centuries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe site on which the city of Mandu is placed is one of the noblest\r\noccupied by any capital in India. It is an extensive plateau, detached\r\nfrom the mainland of Malwa by a deep ravine about 300 to 400 yards\r\nacross, where narrowest, and nowhere less than 200 ft. in depth. This is\r\ncrossed by a noble causeway, defended by three gateways, and flanked by\r\ntombs on either hand. The plateau is surrounded by walls erected on the\r\nbrink of the cliff--it is said 28 miles in extent. This, however,\r\nconveys a very erroneous idea of the size of the place, unless qualified\r\nby the information that the walls follow the sinuosities of the ravines\r\nwherever they occur, and many of these cut into the hill a mile or two,\r\nand are only half a mile across. The plateau may be four or five miles\r\neast and west, and three miles north and south, most pleasingly\r\ndiversified in surface, abounding in water, and fertile in the highest\r\ndegree, as is too plainly evidenced by the rank vegetation, which is\r\ntearing the buildings of the city to pieces or obscuring them so that\r\nthey can hardly be seen.\r\n\r\nThe finest building in the city is the Jumma Musjid, commenced and\r\nnearly completed by Hoshang, the second king, who reigned from A.D. 1405\r\nto A.D. 1432, which, though not very large, is so simple and grand in\r\noutline and details, that it ranks high among the monuments of its\r\nclass. Its dimensions are externally 290 ft. by 275 ft., exclusive of\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\nInternally, the courtyard is almost an exact square of 162 ft., and\r\nwould be quite so, were it not that two of the piers on the east and\r\nwest faces are doubled. In other respects the four sides of the court\r\nare exactly similar, each being ornamented by eleven great arches of\r\nprecisely the same dimensions and height, supported by piers or pillars,\r\neach of one single block of red sandstone. The only variety attempted\r\nis, that the east side has two arcades in depth, the north and south\r\nthree: while the west side, or that facing Mecca, has five, besides\r\nbeing ornamented by three great domes, each 42 ft. in diameter.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen on the plan (Woodcut No. 308), these large domes are\r\nsupported each by twelve pillars. The pillars are all equally spaced,\r\nthe architect having omitted, for the sake of uniformity, to widen the\r\ncentral avenues on the intersection of which the domes stand. It follows\r\nfrom this that the four sides of the octagon supporting the dome, which\r\nare parallel to the sides of the court, are shorter than the four\r\ndiagonal sides. Internally, this produces a very awkward appearance; but\r\nit could not have been avoided except by running into another\r\ndifficulty--that of having oblong spaces at the intersections of the\r\nwider aisles with the narrower, to which the smaller domes must have\r\nbeen fitted. Perhaps, on the whole, the architect took the less\r\ninconvenient course of the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 308. Plan of Mosque at Mandu. No scale.]\r\n\r\nThe interior of the court is represented in Woodcut No. 309, and for\r\nsimple grandeur and expression of power it may, perhaps, be taken as one\r\nof the very best specimens now to be found in India. It is, however,\r\nfast falling to decay, and a few years more may deprive it of most of\r\nthat beauty which so impressed me when I visited it in 1839.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the founder, which stands behind the mosque, though not\r\nremarkable for size, is a very grand specimen of the last resting-place\r\nof a stern old Pathan king. Both internally and externally it is reveted\r\nwith white marble, artistically, but not constructively, applied, and\r\nconsequently in many places peeling off. The light is only admitted by\r\nthe doorway and two small windows, so that the interior is gloomy, but\r\nnot more so than seems suitable to its destination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 309. Courtyard of Great Mosque at Mandu. (From a Sketch\r\nby the Author.)]\r\n\r\nOn one side of the mosque is a splendid Dharmsala, or hall, 230 ft.\r\nlong, supported by three ranges of pillars, twenty-eight in each row.\r\nThese are either borrowed from a Hindu edifice, or formed by some native\r\narchitect from stones originally Hindu, and on the north side is a\r\nporch, which is avowedly only a re-erection of the pillars of a Jaina\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nThe palaces of Mandu are, however, perhaps even more remarkable than its\r\nmosques. Of these the principal is called Jehaj Mehal, from its being\r\nsituated between two great tanks--almost literally in the water, like a\r\n“ship.” It is so covered with vegetation that it is almost impossible to\r\nsketch or photograph it,[521] but its mass and picturesque outline make\r\nit one of the most remarkable edifices of its date; very unlike the\r\nrefined elegance afterwards introduced by the Moguls, but well worthy of\r\nbeing the residence of an independent Pathan chief of a warrior state.\r\n\r\nThe principal apartment is a vaulted hall, some 24 ft. wide by twice\r\nthat length, and 24 ft. in height, flanked by buttresses massive enough\r\nto support a vault four times its section. Across the end of the hall is\r\na range of apartments three storeys in height, and the upper ones\r\nadorned with rude, bold, balconied windows. Beyond this is a long range\r\nof vaulted halls, standing in the water, which were apparently the\r\nliving apartments of the palace. Like the rest of the palace they are\r\nbold, and massive to a degree seldom found in Indian edifices, and\r\nproduce a corresponding effect.\r\n\r\nOn the brink of the precipice overlooking the valley of the Nerbudda is\r\nanother palace, called that of Baz Bahadur, of a lighter and more\r\nelegant character, but even more ruined than the northern palace, and\r\nscattered over the whole plateau are ruins of tombs and buildings of\r\nevery class and so varied as almost to defy description. In their\r\nsolitude, in a vast uninhabited jungle, they convey as vivid an\r\nimpression of the ephemeral splendour of these Mahomedan dynasties as\r\nanything in India, and, if illustrated, would alone suffice to prove how\r\nwonderfully their builders had grasped the true elements of\r\narchitectural design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBENGAL.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nKudam ul Roussoul Mosque, Gaur--Adinah Mosque, Maldah.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL--GAUR.\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to understand why the architects of Malwa should\r\nhave adopted a style so essentially arcuate as that which we find in the\r\ncapital, while their brethren, on either hand, at Jaunpore and\r\nAhmedabad, clung so fondly to a trabeate form wherever they had an\r\nopportunity of employing it. The Mandu architects had the same\r\ninitiation to the Hindu forms in the mosques at Dhar; and there must\r\nhave been innumerable Jaina temples to furnish materials to a far\r\ngreater extent than we find them utilised, but we neither find them\r\nborrowing nor imitating, but adhering steadily to the pointed-arch\r\nstyle, which is the essential characteristic of their art in foreign\r\ncountries. It is easy to understand, on the other hand, why in Bengal\r\nthe trabeate style never was in vogue. The country is practically\r\nwithout stone, or any suitable material for forming either pillars or\r\nbeams. Having nothing but brick, it was almost of necessity that they\r\nemployed arches everywhere, and in every building that had any\r\npretensions to permanency. The Bengal style being, however, the only one\r\nwholly of brick in India Proper, has a local individuality of its own,\r\nwhich is curious and interesting, though, from the nature of the\r\nmaterial, deficient in many of the higher qualities of art which\r\ncharacterise the buildings constructed with larger and better materials.\r\nBesides elaborating a pointed-arched brick style of their own, the\r\nBengalis introduced a new form of roof, which has had a most important\r\ninfluence on both the Mahomedan and Hindu styles in more modern times.\r\nAs already mentioned in describing the chuttrie at Alwar (_ante_, p.\r\n474), the Bengalis, taking advantage of the elasticity of the bambu,\r\nuniversally employ in their dwellings a curvilinear form of roof, which\r\nhas become so familiar to their eyes, that they consider it beautiful\r\n(Woodcut No. 310). It is so in fact when bambu and thatch are the\r\nmaterials employed, but when translated into stone or brick\r\narchitecture, its taste is more questionable. There is, however, so\r\nmuch that is conventional in architecture, and beauty depends to such an\r\nextent on association, that strangers are hardly fair judges in a case\r\nof this sort. Be this as it may, certain it is, at all events, that\r\nafter being elaborated into a feature of permanent architecture in\r\nBengal, this curvilinear form found its way in the 17th century to\r\nDelhi, and in the 18th to Lahore, and all the intermediate buildings\r\nfrom, say A.D. 1650, betray its presence to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 310. Modern Curved Form of Roof.]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious illustration, however, of how much there is in\r\narchitecture that is conventional and how far familiarity may render\r\nthat beautiful which is not so abstractedly, that while to the European\r\neye this form always remains unpleasing, to the native eye--Hindu or\r\nMahomedan--it is the most elegant of modern inventions.[522]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven irrespective, however, of its local peculiarities, the architecture\r\nof Gaur, the Mahomedan capital of Bengal, deserves attention for its\r\nextent and the immense variety of detail which it displays. Bengal,\r\napparently because it was so distant from the capital, was erected into\r\na separate kingdom almost simultaneously with Delhi itself. Mahommad\r\nBakhtiar Khilji, governor of Berar under Kutub ud-dîn, became first king\r\nof the dynasty in A.D. 1203, and was succeeded by a long line of\r\nforty-eight kings, till the state was absorbed into Akbar’s vast kingdom\r\nin A.D. 1573, under Daud Khan ben Suleiman. Though none of these kings\r\ndid anything that entitles them to a place in general history, they\r\npossessed one of the richest portions of India, and employed their\r\nwealth in adorning their capital with buildings, which, when in a state\r\nof repair, must have been gorgeous, even if not always in the best\r\ntaste. The climate of Bengal is, however, singularly inimical to the\r\npreservation of architectural remains. If the roots of a tree of the fig\r\nkind once find a resting-place in any crevice of a building, its\r\ndestruction is inevitable; and even without this, the luxuriant growth\r\nof the jungle hides the building so completely, that it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to discover it--always to explore it. Add to this that Gaur is\r\nsingularly well suited to facilitate the removal of materials by\r\nwater-carriage. During the summer inundation, boats can float up to any\r\nof the ruins, and after embarking stones or bricks, drop down the\r\nstream to any new capital that may be rising. It thus happens that\r\nMoorshedabad, Hoogly, and even Calcutta, are rich in spoils of the old\r\nPathan capital of Bengal, while it has itself become only a mass of\r\npicturesque but almost indistinguishable ruins.\r\n\r\nThe city of Gaur was a famous capital of the Hindus long before it was\r\ntaken possession of by the Mahomedans. The Sên and Bellala dynasties of\r\nBengal seem to have resided here, and no doubt adorned it with temples\r\nand edifices worthy of their fame and wealth. These, however, were\r\nprobably principally in brick, though adorned with pillars and details\r\nin what used to be called black marble, but seems to be an indurated\r\npotstone of very fine grain, and which takes a beautiful polish. Many\r\nfragments of Hindu art in this material are found among the ruins; and\r\nif carefully examined might enable us to restore the style. Its\r\ninterest, however, principally lies in the influence it had on the\r\nMahomedan style that succeeded it. It is neither like that of Delhi, nor\r\nJaunpore, nor any other style, but one purely local, and not without\r\nconsiderable merit in itself; its principal characteristic being heavy\r\nshort pillars of stone supporting pointed arches and vaults, in\r\nbrick--whereas at Jaunpore, for instance, light pillars carried\r\nhorizontal architraves and flat ceilings.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the style will be seen in the example from a\r\nmosque called the Kudam ul Roussoul at Gaur, and is by no means devoid\r\nof architectural merit (Woodcut No. 311). The solidity of the supports\r\ngo far to redeem the inherent weakness of brick architecture, and by\r\ngiving the arches a firm base to start from, prevents the smallness of\r\ntheir parts from injuring the general effect. It also presents, though\r\nin a very subdued form, the curvilinear form of the roof, which is so\r\ncharacteristic of the style.\r\n\r\nIn Gaur itself there are two very handsome mosques--the Golden and the\r\nBarah Durwaza, or twelve-doored. Both their façades are in stone, and\r\ncovered with foliaged patterns in low-relief, borrowed evidently from\r\nthe terra-cotta ornaments which were more frequently employed, and\r\ncontinued a favourite mode of adorning façades down to the time of the\r\nerection of the Kantonuggur temple illustrated above (Woodcut No. 263).\r\nIn the interior their pillars have generally been removed, and the\r\nvaults consequently fallen in, so that it is not easy to judge of their\r\neffect, even if the jungle would admit of the whole area being grasped\r\nat once. Their general disposition may be judged of, however, by the\r\nplan on page 549 (Woodcut No. 312) of the Adinah mosque at Maldah, which\r\nformed at the time it was erected the northern suburb of the capital.\r\nFrom inscriptions upon it, it appears that this mosque was erected by\r\nSikander Shah, one of the most illustrious of his race (A.D. 1358-1367),\r\nwith the intention of being himself buried within its precincts, or in\r\nits immediate neighbourhood. Its dimensions are considerable, being\r\nnearly 500 ft. north and south, and nearly 300 ft. east and west. In the\r\ncentre it contains a courtyard, surrounded on all sides by a thick wall\r\nof brick, divided by eighty-eight similar arched openings, only one of\r\nwhich, that in the centre of the west side facing Mecca, is wider and\r\nmore dignified than the rest. The roof in like manner is supported by\r\n266 pillars of black hornblende, similar in design to those represented\r\nin Woodcut No. 311. They are bold and pleasing in design, but it must be\r\nconfessed wanting in variety. These with the walls support no less than\r\n385 domes, all similar in design and construction. The only variation\r\nthat is made is where a platform, called the Padshah ka Takht, or King’s\r\nThrone, divides a part of the building into two storeys.[523]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 311. Kudam ul Roussoul Mosque, Gaur. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nA design, such as that of the Adinah mosque, would be appropriate\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 312. Plan of Adinah Mosque, Maldah. Scale 100 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nfor a caravanserai; but in an edifice where expression and beauty were\r\nabsolutely required it is far too monotonous. The same defect runs\r\nthrough the whole group; and though their size and elegance of details,\r\njoined with the picturesque state of richly foliaged ruin in which they\r\nare now found, make them charming subjects for the pencil, they possess\r\nall the defects of design we remarked in the great halls of a thousand\r\ncolumns in the south of this country.[524] It seems, indeed, almost as\r\nif here we had again got among the Tamil race, and that their\r\npeculiarities were reappearing on the surface, though dressed in the\r\ngarb of a foreign race.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the antiquities of the place is a minar,\r\nstanding in the fort (Woodcut No. 313). For two-thirds of the height it\r\nis a polygon of twelve sides; above that circular, till it attains the\r\nheight of 84 ft. The door is at some distance from the ground, and\r\naltogether it looks more like an Irish round-tower than any other\r\nexample known, though it is most improbable that there should be any\r\nconnexion between the two forms. It is evidently a pillar of victory--a\r\nJaya Stambha--such as the Kutub Minar at Delhi, and those at Coel,\r\nDowlutabad, and elsewhere. There is, or was, an inscription on this\r\nmonument which ascribed its erection to Feroze Shah. If this is so, it\r\nmust be the king of that province who reigned in Gaur A.H. 702-715, or\r\nA.D. 1302-1315,[525] and the character of the architecture fully bears\r\nout this adscription.[526] The native tradition is, that a saint, Peer\r\nAsa, lived, like Simon Stylites, on its summit!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 313. Minar at Gaur. (From a Photograph by J. H.\r\nRavenshaw, B.C.S.)]\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are several of the gateways of Gaur which are of\r\nconsiderable magnificence. The finest is that called Dhakhal, which,\r\nthough of brick, and adorned only with terra-cotta ornaments, is as\r\ngrand an object of its class as is to be found anywhere. The gate of the\r\ncitadel, and the southern gate of the city, are very noble examples of\r\nwhat can be done with bricks, and bricks only. It is not, however, in\r\nthe dimensions of its buildings or the beauty of their details that the\r\nglory of Gaur resides; it is in the wonderful mass of ruins stretching\r\nalong what was once the high bank of the Ganges, for nearly twenty\r\nmiles, from Maldah to Maddapore--mosques still in use, mixed with mounds\r\ncovering ruins--tombs, temples, tanks and towers, scattered without\r\norder over an immense distance, and half buried in a luxuriance of\r\nvegetation which only this part of India can exhibit. What looks poor,\r\nand may be in indifferent taste, drawn on paper and reduced to scale,\r\nmay give an idea of splendour in decay when seen as it is, and in this\r\nrespect there are none of the ancient capitals of India which produce a\r\nmore striking, and at the same time a more profoundly melancholy,\r\nimpression than these ruins of the old Pathan capital of Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nKALBURGAH.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nThe Mosque at Kalburgah.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nAla ud-dîn Bahmani, a servant in Mahamud Tugluck’s court   A.D. 1347\r\nMuhammad Shah.

It was almost impossible, however, that a state in the\r\nsemi-barbarous condition of the Pathans of that day could so organise a\r\ngovernment as to rule so extensive and varied an empire from one central\r\npoint, and that as remote as Delhi. Tugluck Shah felt this, and proposed\r\nto establish the capital at Dowlutabad. If he had been able to\r\naccomplish this, the whole of the south might have been permanently\r\nconquered. As it was, the Bellala dynasty of Hullabîd was destroyed in\r\nA.D. 1311,[527] and that of Worangul crippled but not finally conquered\r\ntill some time afterwards,[528] while the rising power of Vijayanagar\r\nformed a barrier which shielded the southern states--the Chera, Chola,\r\nPandya--against Mahomedan encroachment for some centuries after that\r\ntime; and but for the establishment of Mahomedan kingdoms independent of\r\nthe central power at Delhi, the Dekhan might have been lost to the\r\nMoslems, and the Hindus held their own for a long time, perhaps for\r\never, to the south of the Vindhya range.\r\n\r\nThe first of those dynasties that successfully established its\r\nindependence was that called the Bahmani, from its founder, Hasan Ganju,\r\nbeing the servant of a Brahman in Mahamud Tugluck’s court, and owing his\r\nrise to his master, he adopted his name as a title in gratitude. He\r\nestablished himself at Kalburgah, an ancient Hindu city of the Dekhan,\r\nand with his immediate successors not only held in check the Hindu\r\nsovereigns of Worangul and Vijayanagar, but actually forced them to pay\r\nhim tribute. This prosperous state of affairs lasted for nearly a\r\ncentury, when Ahmad Shah I. (A.D. 1422-1425), for some reason not\r\nexplained, transferred the seat of power to Bidar. They lingered on for\r\nanother century or more, latterly known as the Berid Shahis, till they\r\nwere absorbed in the great Mogul empire in A.D. 1609. Long before that,\r\nhowever, their place in the Dekhan had been taken by the Bijapur Adil\r\nShahis, who established themselves there A.D. 1489.\r\n\r\nDuring the short supremacy of Kalburgah as capital of the Dekhan (A.D.\r\n1347-1435), it was adorned with several important buildings, among which\r\nwas a mosque, one of the most remarkable of its class in India (Woodcuts\r\nNos. 314, 315). Its dimensions are considerable, though not excessive:\r\nit measures 216 ft. east and west, and 176 ft. north and south, and\r\nconsequently covers 38,016 sq. ft. Its great peculiarity, however, is\r\nthat, alone of all the great mosques in India, the whole of the area is\r\ncovered over. Comparing it, for instance, with the mosque at Mandu,\r\nwhich is the one in other respects most like it, it will be observed\r\nthat the greater part of its area is occupied by a courtyard surrounded\r\nby arcades. At Kalburgah there is no court, the whole is roofed over,\r\nand the light is admitted through the side walls, which are pierced with\r\ngreat arches for this purpose on all sides except the west (Woodcut No.\r\n316).\r\n\r\nHaving only one example of the class, it is not easy to form an opinion\r\nwhich of the two systems of building is the better. There is a repose\r\nand a solemnity which is singularly suited to a place of prayer, in a\r\ncourtyard enclosed by cloisters on all sides, and only pierced by two or\r\nthree doors; but, on the other hand, the heat and glare arising from\r\nreflection of the sun’s rays in these open courts is sometimes most\r\npainful in such a climate as India, and nowhere, so far as I know, was\r\nit ever even attempted to modify this by awnings. On the Kalburgah plan,\r\non the contrary, the solid roof covering the whole space afforded\r\nprotection from the sun’s rays to all worshippers, and every aisle being\r\nopen at one or both ends, prevented anything like gloom, and admitted of\r\nfar freer ventilation than was attainable in the enclosed courts, while\r\nthe requisite privacy could easily have been obtained by a low enclosing\r\nwall at some distance from the mosque itself. On the whole, my\r\nimpression is that the Kalburgah plan is the preferable one of the two,\r\nboth for convenience and for architectural effect, so much so indeed,\r\nthat it is very difficult to understand why, when once tried, it was\r\nnever afterwards repeated. Probably the cause of its being abandoned was\r\nthe difficulty of draining so extensive a flat roof during the rains.\r\nAny settlement or any crack must have been fatal; yet this mosque stands\r\nin seemingly good repair, after four centuries of comparative neglect.\r\nWhichever way the question is decided, it must be admitted that this is\r\none of the finest of the old Pathan mosques of India, at least among\r\nthose which are built wholly of original materials--and in the arcuate\r\nstyle--of Mahomedan art. Those at Delhi and Ajmir are more interesting\r\nof course, but it is from adventitious circumstances. This owes its\r\ngreatness only to its own original merits of design.[529]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 314. Mosque at Kalburgah. (From a Plan by the Hon. Sir\r\nArthur Gordon.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 315. Half elevation half section of the Mosque at\r\nKalburgah. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 316. View of the Mosque at Kalburgah. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nBesides the mosque, there is in Kalburgah a bazaar, 570 ft. long by 60\r\nft. wide, over all, adorned by a range of sixty-one arches on either\r\nhand, supported by pillars of a quasi-Hindu character, and with a block\r\nof buildings of a very ornamental character at either end. I am not\r\naware of anything of its class more striking in any part of India. The\r\narcades that most resemble this are those that line the street called\r\nthe Street of the Pilgrims, at Vijayanagar, which may be contemporary\r\nwith this bazaar.[530]\r\n\r\nThere are other buildings, especially one gigantic archway, in the city\r\nof Kalburgah, the use of which is not apparent, and some very grand old\r\ntombs, with sloping walls; but we must wait for further information\r\nbefore they can be utilised in a history of Indian architecture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the seat of government was removed to Bidar by Ahmad Shah, A.D.\r\n1422-1435, the new capital was adorned by edifices worthy of the\r\ngreatness of the dynasty, but now all apparently ruined. Among these the\r\nmost magnificent appears to be the madrissa erected by Mahomet Gaun, the\r\nfaithful but unfortunate minister of the tyrant Mahmúd II. It appears to\r\nhave been finished two years before his death, in A.D. 1481, and in\r\nFerishta’s time was one of the most complete and flourishing\r\nestablishments of its class in India.[531] Unfortunately, when the place\r\nwas besieged by Aurungzebe, a quantity of gunpowder was stored in its\r\nvaults, and exploded, either accidentally or by design, so as to ruin\r\none wing. Since then the building has been disused, but so far as can be\r\njudged from such imperfect information as is available, it must have\r\nbeen one of the most splendid buildings of its day.[532] The tombs too\r\nof the Berid Shahi dynasty, which reigned in Bidar from A.D. 1492-1609,\r\nare of considerable splendour, and rival those of Golcondah in extent.\r\nBidar, however, has not yet been visited by anyone who has had the power\r\nor opportunity of drawing or describing its monuments in such a manner\r\nas to enable another to utilise them for historical purposes, and till\r\nthis is done, a knowledge of them must remain among the many desiderata\r\nin Indian art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBIJAPUR.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nThe Jumma Musjid--Tombs of Ibrahim and Mahmúd--The Audience Hall--Tomb\r\nof Nawab Amir Khan, near Tatta.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nYusaf Khan Adil Shah     A.D. 1501\r\nIsmail Adil Shah              1511\r\nMullu Adil Shah               1534\r\nIbrahim Adil Shah I.          1535\r\nAli Adil Shah                 1557\r\nIbrahim Adil Shah II.         1579\r\nMuhammad                      1626\r\nAli Adil Shah II.             1660\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the materials existed for the purpose, it would be extremely\r\ninteresting, from a historical point of view, to trace the various\r\nstyles that grew out of each other as the later dynasties of the Dekhan\r\nsucceeded one another and strove to surpass their predecessors in\r\narchitectural magnificence in their successive capitals. With the\r\nexception, however, of Bijapur, none of the Dekhani cities produced any\r\nedifices that, taken by themselves irrespective of their surroundings\r\nand historical importance, seem to be of any very great value in an\r\nartistic sense.\r\n\r\nBurhampur, which was the capital of the Faruki dynasty of Kandeish, from\r\nA.D. 1370-1596, does possess some buildings remarkable for their extent\r\nand picturesque in their decay, but of very little artistic value, and\r\nmany of them--especially the later ones--in very questionable taste.\r\nAhmednugger, the capital of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, A.D. 1490-1607, is\r\nsingularly deficient in architectural grandeur, considering how long it\r\nwas the capital of an important dynasty; while if Golcondah, the chosen\r\nseat of the Kutub Shahi dynasty, A.D. 1512-1672, has any buildings that\r\nare remarkable, all that can be said is that they have not yet been\r\ndrawn or described. The tombs of the kings of this dynasty, and of their\r\nnobles and families, do form as extensive and as picturesque a group as\r\nis to be found anywhere; but individually they are in singularly bad\r\ntaste. Their bases are poor and weak, their domes tall and exaggerated,\r\nshowing all the faults of the age in which they were executed, but still\r\nnot unworthy of a place in history if the materials existed for\r\nillustrating them properly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the Bahmani dynasty of Kalburgah maintained the\r\nstruggle against the Hindu principalities of the south for nearly a\r\ncentury and a half, with very little assistance from either the central\r\npower at Delhi or their cognate states in the Dekhan. Before the end of\r\nthe 15th century, however, they began to feel that decay inherent in all\r\nEastern dynasties; and the Hindus might have recovered their original\r\npossessions, up to the Vindhya at least, but for the appearance of a new\r\nand more vigorous competitor in the field in the person of Yusaf Khan, a\r\nson of Amurath II. of Anatolia. He was thus a Turk of pure blood, and,\r\nas it happens, born in Constantinople, though his mother was forced to\r\nfly thence while he was still an infant. After a varied career he was\r\npurchased for the body-guard at Bidar, and soon raised himself to such\r\npre-eminence that on the defeat of Dustur Dinar, in 1501, he was enabled\r\nto proclaim his independence and establish himself as the founder of the\r\nAdil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur.\r\n\r\nFor the first sixty or seventy years after their accession, the struggle\r\nfor existence was too severe to admit of the Adil Shahis devoting much\r\nattention to architecture. The real building epoch of the city commences\r\nwith Ali, A.D. 1557, and all the important buildings are crowded into\r\nthe 100 years which elapsed between his accession and the wars with\r\nAurungzebe, which ended in the final destruction of the dynasty.\r\n\r\nDuring that period, however, their capital was adorned with a series of\r\nbuildings as remarkable as those of any of the Mahomedan capitals of\r\nIndia, hardly excepting even Agra and Delhi, and showing a wonderful\r\noriginality of design not surpassed by those of such capitals as\r\nJaunpore or Ahmedabad, though differing from them in a most marked\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy now to determine how far this originality arose from the\r\nEuropean descent of the Adil Shahis and their avowed hatred of\r\neverything that belonged to the Hindus, or whether it arose from any\r\nlocal circumstances, the value of which we can now hardly appreciate. My\r\nimpression is, that the former is the true cause, and that the largeness\r\nand grandeur of the Bijapur style is owing to its quasi-Western origin,\r\nand to reminiscences of the great works of the Roman and Byzantine\r\narchitects.\r\n\r\nLike most Mahomedan dynasties, the Adil Shahis commenced their\r\narchitectural career by building a mosque and madrissa in the fort at\r\nBijapur out of Hindu remains. How far the pillars used there by them are\r\n_in situ_, or torn from other buildings, we are not informed. From\r\nphotographs, it would appear that considerable portions of them are used\r\nat least for the purposes for which they were intended; but this is not\r\nincompatible with the idea that they were removed from their original\r\npositions and readapted to their present purposes. Be this as it may, as\r\nsoon as the dynasty had leisure to think really about the matter, they\r\nabandoned entirely all tendency to copy Hindu forms or Hindu details,\r\nbut set to work to carry out a pointed-arched, or domical style of their\r\nown, and did it with singular success.[533]\r\n\r\nThe Jumma Musjid, which is one of the earlier regular buildings of the\r\ncity, was commenced by Ali Adil Shah (A.D. 1557-1579), and, though\r\ncontinued by his successors on the same plan, was never completely\r\nfinished, the fourth side of the courtyard with its great gateway not\r\nhaving been even commenced when the dynasty was overthrown. Even as it\r\nis, it is one of the finest mosques in India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 317. Plan of Jumma Musjid, Bijapur. (From a Drawing by A.\r\nCumming, C.E.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the plan (Woodcut No. 317), it would have been, if\r\ncompleted, a rectangle of 331 ft. by 257 ft. The mosque itself is\r\nperfect, and measures 257 ft. by 145 ft., and consequently covers about\r\n37,000 sq. ft. It consequently is in itself only a very little less than\r\nthe mosque at Kalburgah; but this is irrespective of the wings, which\r\nextend 186 ft. beyond, so that if complete it would have covered about\r\n50,000 sq. ft. to 55,000 sq. ft., or about the usual size of a mediæval\r\ncathedral. It is more remarkable, however, for the beauty of its details\r\nthan either the arrangement or extent of its plan. Each of the squares\r\ninto which it is divided is roofed by a dome of very beautiful form, but\r\nso flat (Woodcut No. 318) as to be concealed externally in the thickness\r\nof the roof. Twelve of these squares are occupied in the centre by the\r\ngreat dome, 57 ft. in diameter in the circular part, but standing on a\r\nsquare measuring 70 ft. each way. The dimensions of this dome were\r\nimmensely exceeded afterwards by that which covers the tomb of Mahmúd,\r\nconstructed on the same plan and 124 ft. in diameter; but the smaller\r\ndimensions here employed enabled the architect to use taller and more\r\ngraceful outlines, and if he had had the courage to pierce the niches at\r\nthe base of his dome, and make them into windows, he would probably have\r\nhad the credit of designing the most graceful building of its class in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 318. Plan and section of smaller Domes of Jumma Musjid.\r\n\r\nScale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 319. Section on the line A B through the Great Dome of\r\nthe Jumma Musjid. (From a Drawing by Mr. Cumming.) Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nIf the plan of this mosque is compared with that of Kalburgah (Woodcut\r\nNo. 314), it will be seen what immense strides the Indian architects had\r\nmade in constructive skill and elegance of detail during the century and\r\na half that elapsed between the erection of these two buildings. If they\r\nwere drawn to the same scale this would be more apparent than it is at\r\nfirst sight; but on half the present scale the details of the Kalburgah\r\nmosque could hardly be expressed, while the largeness of the parts, and\r\nregularity of arrangement can, in the scale adopted, be made perfectly\r\nclear in the Bijapur example. The latter is, undoubtedly, the more\r\nperfect of the two, but there is a picturesqueness about the earlier\r\nbuilding, and a poetry about its arrangements, that go far to make up\r\nfor the want of the skill and the elegance exhibited in its more modern\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nThe tomb which Ali Adil Shah commenced for himself was a square,\r\nmeasuring about 200 ft. each way, and had it been completed as designed\r\nwould have rivalled any tomb in India. It is one of the disadvantages,\r\nhowever, of the Turanian system of each king building his own tomb, that\r\nif he dies early his work remains unfinished. This defect is more than\r\ncompensated in practice by the fact that unless a man builds his own\r\nsepulchre, the chances are very much against anything worthy of\r\nadmiration being dedicated to his memory by his surviving relatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 320. Tomb or Rozah of Ibrahim. (From a Plan by Mr.\r\nCumming.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nHis successor Ibrahim, warned by the fate of his predecessor’s tomb,\r\ncommenced his own on so small a plan--116 ft. square--that as he was\r\nblessed by a long and prosperous reign, it was only by ornament that he\r\ncould render it worthy of himself. This, however, he accomplished by\r\ncovering every part with the most exquisite and elaborate carvings. The\r\nornamental inscriptions are so numerous that it is said the whole Koran\r\nis engraved on its walls. The cornices are supported by the most\r\nelaborate bracketing, the windows filled with tracery, and every part so\r\nrichly ornamented that had his artists not been Indians it might have\r\nbecome vulgar. The principal apartment in the tomb is a square of 40 ft.\r\neach way, covered by a stone roof, perfectly flat in the centre, and\r\nsupported only by a cove projecting 10 ft. from the walls on every\r\nside. How the roof is supported is a mystery which can only be\r\nunderstood by those who are familiar with the use the Indians make of\r\nmasses of concrete, which, with good mortar, seems capable of infinite\r\napplications unknown in Europe. Above this apartment is another in the\r\ndome as ornamental as the one below it, though its only object is to\r\nobtain externally the height required for architectural effect, and\r\naccess to its interior can only be obtained by a dark narrow stair in\r\nthe thickness of the wall.\r\n\r\nBesides the tomb there is a mosque to correspond; and the royal garden,\r\nin which these are situated, is adorned, as usual, internally with\r\nfountains and kiosks, and externally with colonnades and caravansaries\r\nfor strangers and pilgrims, the whole making up a group as rich and as\r\npicturesque as any in India, and far excelling anything of the sort on\r\nthis side of the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 321. Plan of Tomb of Mahmúd at Bijapur. Scale 100 ft. to\r\n1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe tomb of his successor, Mahmúd, was in design as complete a contrast\r\nto that just described as can well be conceived, and is as remarkable\r\nfor simple grandeur and constructive boldness as that of Ibrahim was for\r\nexcessive richness and contempt of constructive proprieties. It is\r\nconstructed on the same principle as that employed in the design of the\r\ndome of the great mosque (Woodcut No. 319), but on so much larger a\r\nscale as to convert into a wonder of constructive skill what, in that\r\ninstance, was only an elegant architectural design.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the plan, it is internally a square apartment, 135\r\nft. each way; its area consequently is 18,225 sq. ft., while that of the\r\nPantheon at Rome is, within the walls, only 15,833 sq. ft.; and even\r\ntaking into account all the recesses in the walls of both buildings,\r\nthis is still the larger of the two.\r\n\r\nAt the height of 57 ft. from the floor-line the hall begins to contract,\r\nby a series of pendentives as ingenious as they are beautiful, to a\r\ncircular opening 97 ft. in diameter. On the platform of these\r\npendentives the dome is erected, 124 ft. in diameter, thus leaving a\r\ngallery more than 12 ft. wide all round the interior. Internally, the\r\ndome is 175 ft. high, externally 198 ft., its general thickness being\r\nabout 10 ft.\r\n\r\nThe most ingenious and novel part of the construction of this dome is\r\nthe mode in which its lateral or outward thrust is counteracted. This\r\nwas accomplished by forming the pendentives so that they not only cut\r\noff the angles, but that, as shown in the plan, their arches intersect\r\none another, and form a very considerable mass of masonry perfectly\r\nstable in itself; and, by its weight acting inwards, counteracting any\r\nthrust that can possibly be brought to bear upon it by the pressure of\r\nthe dome. If the whole edifice thus balanced has any tendency to move,\r\nit is to fall inwards, which from its circular form is impossible; while\r\nthe action of the weight of the pendentives being in the opposite\r\ndirection to that of the dome, it acts like a tie, and keeps the whole\r\nin equilibrium, without interfering at all with the outline of the dome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 322. Pendentives of the Tomb of Mahmúd, looking upwards.\r\n(From a Drawing by Mr. Cumming.) Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nIn the Pantheon and most European domes a great mass of masonry is\r\nthrown on the haunches, which entirely hides the external form, and is a\r\nsingularly clumsy expedient in every respect compared with the elegant\r\nmode of hanging the weight inside.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that this expedient gives the dome a perfectly stable\r\nbasis to stand upon, which no thrust can move, still, looking at the\r\nsection (Woodcut No. 323), its form is such that it appears almost\r\nparadoxical that such a building should stand. If the section\r\nrepresented an arch or a vault, it is such as would not stand one hour;\r\nbut the dome is itself so perfect as a constructive expedient, that it\r\nis almost as difficult to build a dome that will fall as it is to build\r\na vault that will stand. As the dome is also, artistically, the most\r\nbeautiful form of roof yet invented, it may be well, before passing from\r\nthe most extraordinary and complex example yet attempted anywhere, to\r\npause and examine a little more closely the theory of its construction.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the diagram to represent the plan of a perfectly flat\r\ndome 100 ft. in diameter, and each rim consequently 10 ft. wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 323. Section of Tomb of Mahmúd at Bijapur. Scale 50 ft.\r\nto 1 in.]\r\n\r\nFurther assuming for convenience that the whole dome weighs 7850 tons,\r\nthe outer rim will weigh 2826 tons, or almost exactly as much as the\r\nthree inner rims put together; the next will weigh 2204, the next 1568,\r\nthe next 942, and the inner only 314; so that a considerable extra\r\nthickness might be heaped on it, or on the two inner ones, without their\r\npreponderance at all affecting the stability of the dome; but this is\r\nthe most unfavourable view to take of the case. To understand the\r\nproblem more clearly, let us suppose the semicircle A A A (Woodcut No.\r\n324) to represent the section of a hemispherical dome. The first\r\nsegment of this, though only 10 ft. in width, will be 30 ft. in height,\r\nand will weigh 9420 tons; the next, 10 ft. high and 10 ft. wide, will\r\nweigh 3140; the third, 10 ft. by 6 ft., will weigh only 1884; the fourth\r\nwill weigh 942; and the central portion, as before, 316.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 324. Diagram illustrative of Domical Construction.]\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that the first portion, A B, being the most\r\nperpendicular, is the one least liable to disturbance or thrust, and,\r\nbeing also two-thirds of the whole weight of the dome, if steady and\r\nfirmly constructed, it is a more than sufficient abutment for the\r\nremaining third, which is the whole of the rest of the dome.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from an inspection of the figure, or from any section of\r\nthe dome, how easy it must be to construct the first segment from the\r\nspringing; and if this is very solidly built and placed on an immoveable\r\nbasis, the architect may play with the rest; and he must be clumsy\r\nindeed if he cannot make it perfectly stable. In the East they did play\r\nwith their domes, and made them of all sorts of fantastic forms, seeking\r\nto please the eye more than to consult the engineering necessities of\r\nthe case, and yet it is the rarest possible contingency to find a dome\r\nthat has fallen through faults in the construction.\r\n\r\nIn Europe architects have been timid and unskilled in dome-building; but\r\nwith our present engineering knowledge it would be easy to construct far\r\nlarger and more daring domes than even this of Mahmúd’s tomb, without\r\nthe smallest fear of accident.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe external ordonnance of this building is as beautiful as that of the\r\ninterior. At each angle stands an octagonal tower eight storeys high,\r\nsimple and bold in its proportions, and crowned by a dome of great\r\nelegance. The lower part of the building is plain and solid, pierced\r\nonly with such openings as are requisite to admit light and air; at the\r\nheight of 83 ft. a cornice projects to the extent of 12 ft. from the\r\nwall, or nearly twice as much as the boldest European architect ever\r\nattempted. Above this an open gallery gives lightness and finish to the\r\nwhole, each face being further relieved by two small minarets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 325. Audience Hall, Bijapur. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe same daring system of construction was carried out by the architects\r\nof Bijapur in their civil buildings. The great Audience Hall, for\r\ninstance (Woodcut No. 325), opens in front with an arch 82 ft. wide,\r\nwhich, had it been sufficiently abutted, might have been a grand\r\narchitectural feature; as it is, it is too like an engineering work to\r\nbe satisfactory. Its cornice was in wood, and some of its supports are\r\nstill in their places. Indeed, it is one of the peculiarities of the\r\narchitecture of this city that, like the English architects in their\r\nroofs, those of Bijapur clung to wood as a constructive expedient long\r\nafter its use had been abandoned in other parts of India. The Ashur\r\nMoobaruk, one of the most splendid palaces in the city, is entirely open\r\non one side, the roof being supported only by two wooden pillars with\r\nimmense bracket-capitals; and the internal ornaments are in the same\r\nmaterial. The result of this practice was the same at Bijapur as in\r\nEngland--far greater depth of framing and greater richness in\r\narchitectural ornamentation, and an intolerance of constructive\r\nawkwardness which led to the happiest results in both countries.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal edifices in the city is one of those seven-storeyed\r\npalaces which come across us so strangely in all out-of-the-way corners\r\nof the world. Add to this that the Ashur Moobaruk has been converted by\r\nthe Mahomedans into a relic-shrine to contain some hairs of the\r\nProphet’s beard, and we have a picture of the strange difficulty of\r\nweaning a Tartar from the innate prejudices of his race.\r\n\r\nBesides these two there are five other palaces within the walls, some of\r\nthem of great splendour, and numberless residences of the nobles and\r\nattendants of the court. But perhaps the most remarkable civil edifice\r\nis a little gateway, known as the Mehturi Mehal (“the Gate of the\r\nSweeper”)--with a legend attached to it too long to quote here. It is in\r\na mixed Hindu and Mahomedan style, every part and every detail covered\r\nwith ornament, but always equally appropriate and elegant. Of its class\r\nit is perhaps the best example in the country, though this class may not\r\nbe the highest.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic walls of the city itself, 6¼ miles in circumference, are\r\na work of no mean magnitude, and, combined with the tombs of those who\r\nbuilt them, and with the ruins of the suburbs of this once great city,\r\nthey make up a scene of grandeur in desolation, equal to anything else\r\nnow to be found even in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCINDE.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor styles of Mahomedan art in India there is one that would\r\nbe singularly interesting in a historical sense if a sufficient number\r\nof examples existed to elucidate it, and they were of sufficient\r\nantiquity to connect the style with those of the West. From its\r\nsituation, almost outside India, the province of Scinde must always have\r\nhad a certain affinity with Persia and the countries lying to the\r\nwestward of the Indus, and if we knew its architectural history we might\r\nprobably be able to trace to their source many of the forms we cannot\r\nnow explain, and join the styles of the East with those of the West in a\r\nmanner we cannot at present pretend to accomplish.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, whether the materials are in existence for\r\ndoing this. The buildings in this province were always in brick, no\r\nstone being available; and though they are not exposed to the\r\ndestructive agencies of vegetation like those of Bengal, the mortar is\r\nbad, and the bricks are easily picked out and utilised by the natives to\r\nbuild their huts or villages.\r\n\r\nAll we at present know belongs to a series of tombs in the neighbourhood\r\nof Tatta, which were erected under the Mogul dynasty by the governors or\r\ngreat men of the province, during their sway. At least the oldest now\r\nknown is that of Amir Khalleel Khan, erected in or about A.D. 1572, the\r\nyear in which Akbar deposed the Jami dynasty and annexed Scinde to his\r\nempire. No tombs or mosques of the earlier dynasties have yet been\r\nedited, though they may exist. The known series extends from A.D.\r\n1572-1640, and all show a strongly-marked affinity to the Persian style\r\nof the same or an earlier age. One example must for the present suffice\r\nto explain their general appearance, for they are all very much alike.\r\nIt is the tomb of the Nawab Amir Khan, who was governor of the province\r\nin the reign of Shah Jehan, from A.D. 1627-1632, and afterwards A.D.\r\n1641-1650. The tomb was built apparently about A.D. 1640 (Woodcut No.\r\n326). It is of brick, but was, like all the others of its class,\r\nornamented with coloured tiles, like those of Persia generally, of great\r\nbeauty of pattern and exquisite harmony of colouring. It is not a very\r\nmonumental way of adorning a building, but, as carried out on the dome\r\nof the Rock at Jerusalem, in the middle of the 16th or in the mosque at\r\nTabreez in the beginning of the 13th century,[534] and generally in\r\nPersian buildings, it is capable of producing the most pleasing effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 326.

It is the style which was described by Roe and\r\nBernier, and all subsequent travellers. It was rendered familiar to the\r\npublic in Europe by the drawings of Daniell in the beginning of this\r\ncentury, and, since Agra and Delhi became practically British cities,\r\ntheir buildings have been described, drawn, and photographed till they\r\nhave become almost as well known as any found in Europe. It will take a\r\nvery long time before even photography will render the mosques or tombs\r\nof such cities as Ahmedabad or Bijapur as familiar or as easily\r\nunderstood. Yet it is, perhaps, true to assert that the buildings of\r\nother dynasties, commencing with the mosques at the Kutub and at Ajmir,\r\nand continuing till the last Dekhani dynasty was destroyed by\r\nAurungzebe, make up a whole as extensive and more interesting, in a\r\nhistorical point of view, than even all that was done by the Moguls. On\r\nthe other hand, however, there is a unity in the works of that dynasty,\r\nand a completeness in their history, which makes the study of their art\r\npeculiarly fascinating, and some of their buildings will bear\r\ncomparison, in some respects, with any architectural productions in any\r\npart of the world. Their buildings, however, are so original, and so\r\nunlike any of the masterpieces of art that we are generally acquainted\r\nwith, that it is almost impossible to institute any comparison between\r\nthem which shall be satisfactory. How, for instance, can we compare the\r\nParthenon with the Taje? They are buildings of nearly equal size and\r\nmagnificence, both in white marble, both admirably adapted for the\r\npurposes for which they were built; but what else have they in common?\r\nThe one is simple in its outline, and depending on pillars for its\r\nexternal adornment; the other has no pillars, and owes its greatest\r\neffects to its singularly varied outline and the mode in which its\r\nvarious parts are disposed, many of them wholly detached from the\r\nprincipal mass. The Parthenon belongs, it is true, to a higher class of\r\nart, its sculptures raising it into the region of the most intellectual\r\nbranch of phonetic art; but, on the other hand, the exquisite inlay of\r\nprecious stones at the Taje is so æsthetically beautiful as, in a merely\r\narchitectural estimate, almost to bring it on a level with the Grecian\r\nmasterpiece.[535]\r\n\r\nThough their value, consequently, may be nearly the same, their forms\r\nare so essentially different that they hardly look like productions of\r\nthe same art; and in an art so essentially conventional as architecture\r\nalways is and must be, it requires long familiarity with any new form,\r\nand a knowledge of its origin and use, that can only be acquired by\r\nconstant study, which makes it very difficult for a stranger to realise\r\nthe real beauty that often underlies even the strangest forms. When,\r\nhowever, these difficulties are conquered, it will probably be found\r\nthat there are few among the Eastern styles that deserve more attention,\r\nand would better repay any study that might be bestowed upon them, than\r\nthe architecture of the Moguls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome little interruptions are experienced at the beginning of the\r\nnarrative from the interpolation of the reigns of Shere Shah and his son\r\nSelim in the reign of Humayun. He was an Afghan by descent and an Indian\r\nby birth, and, had he been left to follow his own devices, would, no\r\ndoubt, have built in the style of architecture used at Agra and Delhi\r\nbefore his countrymen were disturbed by the Mogul invasion. We have, it\r\nis true, very little to tell us what that style was during the 170 years\r\nthat elapsed between the death of Tugluck Shah and the first invasion of\r\nBaber, but it seems to have been singularly plain and solid, and very\r\nunlike the florid art introduced by the Moguls, and practised by Shere\r\nShah and his son apparently in rivalry to the new master of Hindustan.\r\nSo little difference is there, however, between the architecture of\r\nShere Shah and of Akbar that they must be treated as one style,\r\nbeginning in great sobriety and elegance, and ending in something nearly\r\napproaching to wildness and exuberance of decoration, but still very\r\nbeautiful--in some respects superior to the chaste but feeble elegance\r\nof the later Mogul style that succeeded it.\r\n\r\nThere is, again, a little difficulty and confusion in our having no\r\nexamples of the style as practised by Baber and Humayun. The well-known\r\ntomb of the latter king was certainly built by his son Akbar; Baber was\r\nburied near Cabul, and no building known to be his has yet been\r\nidentified in India. Yet that he did build is certain. In his own\r\n‘Memoirs’ he tells us, “In Agra alone, and of the stone-cutters\r\nbelonging to that place only, I every day employed on my palaces 680\r\npersons; and in Agra, Sikri, Biana, Dhulpur, Gualior, and Koel, there\r\nwere every day employed on my works 1491 stone-cutters.”[536] In the\r\nfollowing pages he describes some of these works, and especially a\r\nBowlee of great magnificence he excavated in the fort of Agra.[537] This\r\nwas in the year 1526, and he lived to carry on these works for five\r\nyears longer. During the ten years that his son retained the empire, we\r\nlearn from Ferishta and other sources that he adorned his capital with\r\nmany splendid edifices: one, a palace containing seven pavilions or\r\naudience-halls--one dedicated to each of the planets, in which he gave\r\naudience on the day of the week dedicated to the planet of the day.[538]\r\nThere are traditions of a mosque he is said to have built on the banks\r\nof the Jumna, opposite where the Taje now stands; and his name is so\r\nfrequently mentioned in connexion with buildings both at Agra and Delhi\r\nthat there can be little doubt that he was a builder to as great an\r\nextent as the troubled character of his reign would admit of. But his\r\nbuildings have perished, so that practically the history of Mogul\r\narchitecture commences with the buildings of an Afghan dynasty who\r\noccupied the throne of India for sixteen years during the last part of\r\nHumayun’s reign.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that before long very considerable light will be thrown\r\nupon the origin of the style which the Moguls introduced into India,\r\nfrom an examination of the buildings erected at Samarcand by Timur a\r\nhundred years before Baber’s time (A.D. 1393-1404). Now that the city is\r\nin the hands of the Russians, it is accessible to Europeans. Its\r\nbuildings have been drawn and photographed, but not yet described so as\r\nto be available for scientific purposes, but sufficiently so to indicate\r\nthe direction in which light may be expected. Though a frightful savage\r\nin most respects, Timur was possessed of a true Turki love for noble\r\narchitecture; and though he generally massacred the inhabitants of any\r\ntown that resisted him, he always spared the architects and artists, and\r\nsent them to work on the embellishment of his capitals. Samarcand was\r\nconsequently filled with splendid edifices, but, so far as can be judged\r\nfrom the materials available, more resembling in style those of Persia\r\nthan anything now known to exist in India. The bulbous dome appears\r\neverywhere, and was not known at that time in India, unless it was in\r\nthe quasi-Persian province of Scinde. Coloured tiles were the favourite\r\nmode of decoration, and altogether their style was gorgeous in the\r\nextreme as compared with the sobriety of the later Pathan buildings in\r\nIndia. A few years hence all this may be made quite clear and\r\nintelligible, meanwhile we must pass on to\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERE SHAH, A.D. 1539-1545.\r\n\r\nCertainly one of the most remarkable men who ever ruled in northern\r\nIndia, though his reign was limited to only five years’ duration; and\r\nduring that brief space, disturbed by all the troubles incident to a\r\nusurpation, he left his impress on every branch of the administration.\r\nThe revenue system, the police, the army administration, all the great\r\nreforms, in fact, which Akbar so successfully carried out, were\r\ncommenced, and to some extent perfected, by this usurper, as the Moguls\r\ncall him. In architecture, too, which most concerns us here, he\r\ncertainly pointed out the path by which his successor reached such\r\neminence.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect of his buildings that I am acquainted with is the\r\nmosque in the Purana Kìlah at Delhi. The walls of this place were\r\nrepaired by Humayun in A.D. 1533, and I do not feel quite sure he had\r\nnot something to do with the mosque. According to the latest\r\nauthorities, however, it is said to have been built--I have no doubt it\r\nwas finished--by Shere Shah in A.D. 1541.[539] It is a single hall, with\r\nfive openings in front through pointed arches of what we would call\r\nTudor form, but beautifully varied in design, and arranged in panels\r\ncarved with the most exquisite designs and ornamented with\r\nparti-coloured marbles. One important dome, pierced with twelve small\r\nwindows, crowns the centre; it has, however, no minarets and no\r\ncourtyard, but even without these adjuncts it is one of the most\r\nsatisfactory buildings of its class in India.[540]\r\n\r\nIn the citadel at Agra there stands--or at least stood when I was\r\nthere--a fragment of a palace built by Shere Shah, or his son Selim,\r\nwhich was as exquisite a piece of decorative art as anything of its\r\nclass in India. Being one of the first to occupy the ground, this palace\r\nwas erected on the highest spot within the fort; hence the present\r\nGovernment, fancying this a favourable site for the erection of a\r\nbarrack, pulled it down, and replaced it by a more than usually hideous\r\nbrick erection of their own. This is now a warehouse, and looms, in\r\nwhitewashed ugliness, over the marble palaces of the Moguls--a fit\r\nstandard of comparison of the tastes of the two races.[541]\r\n\r\nJudging from the fragment that remains, and the accounts received on the\r\nspot, this palace must have gone far to justify the eulogium more than\r\nonce passed on the works of these Pathans--that “they built like giants,\r\nand finished like goldsmiths:” for the stones seem to have been of\r\nenormous size, and the details of most exquisite finish. It has passed\r\naway, however, like many another noble building of its class, under the\r\nruthless barbarism of our rule. Mosques we have generally spared, and\r\nsometimes tombs, because they were unsuited to our economic purposes,\r\nand it would not answer to offend the religious feelings of the natives.\r\nBut when we deposed the kings and appropriated their revenues, there was\r\nno one to claim their now useless abodes of splendour. It was\r\nconsequently found cheaper either to pull them down, or use them as\r\nresidences or arsenals, than to keep them up, so that very few now\r\nremain for the admiration of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Shere Shah has been already described (_ante_, p. 516), as\r\nit is essentially Pathan in style. It was erected at his native place in\r\nBehar, to the south of the Ganges, far from Mogul influence at that\r\ntime, and in the style of severe simplicity that characterised the works\r\nof his race between the times of Tugluck and those of Behlol Lodi (A.D.\r\n1450-1488), the last really independent king of his line.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear how much of the tomb was built by himself, or how\r\nmuch by his son Selim, who certainly finished it. Selim also built the\r\nSelimghur on an island in the Jumna, to which Shah Jehan afterwards\r\nadded his palace in New Delhi. Whether, however, he erected any\r\nbuildings inside is not certain--nothing at least now remains of any\r\nimportance. Generally he seems to have carried on and completed his\r\nfather’s buildings, and between them they have left a group of\r\narchitectural remains which, if collected together and illustrated,\r\nwould form an interesting chapter in the history of Indian-Mahomedan\r\nstyles.[542]\r\n\r\n\r\nAKBAR, 1556-1605.\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to describe all the buildings erected by this\r\nremarkable man during his long reign of forty-nine years, and a hundred\r\nplates would hardly suffice to make known all their peculiarities. Had\r\nAkbar been content to follow in the lines of the style invented by the\r\nPathans and perfected by Shere Shah, it might be easy enough to follow\r\nthe sequence, but nothing in his character is so remarkable as the\r\nspirit of tolerance that pervaded all his acts. He seems to have had as\r\nsincere a love and admiration for his Hindu subjects as he had for those\r\nof his own faith, and whether from policy or inclination, to have\r\ncherished their arts as much as he did those that belonged exclusively\r\nto his own people. The consequence is a mixture throughout all his works\r\nof two styles, often more picturesque than correct, which might, in the\r\ncourse of another half century, have been blended into a completely new\r\nstyle if persevered in. The spirit of tolerance, however, died with him.\r\nThere is no trace of Hinduism in the works of Jehangir or Shah Jehan,\r\nand Aurungzebe would have been horrified at the suggestion that arts of\r\nthe infidels could influence anything he did.\r\n\r\nOne probably of his earliest works was the mausoleum, which he erected\r\nover the remains of his father, Humayun, at Delhi. Though it certainly\r\nwas finished by Akbar, it most probably was designed and commenced by\r\nhis father; for, as frequently remarked in the previous pages of this\r\nwork, the great architectural peculiarity of the Tartar or Mongolian\r\nraces is their tomb-building propensity, in which they are so strongly\r\ndistinguished from the Aryan, and also from the great Semitic families,\r\nwith whom they divide the greater part of the habitable globe. Nowhere\r\nis this more forcibly illustrated than in India--where the tombs of the\r\nPathans and Moguls form a complete and unbroken series of architectural\r\nmonuments from the first years of the Moslem invasion to the present\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe tombs of the Pathans are less splendid than those of the Moguls; but\r\nnevertheless the whole series is singularly interesting, the tombs being\r\nfar more numerous than the mosques. Generally speaking, also, they are\r\nmore artistic in design, and frequently not only larger but more\r\nsplendidly decorated than the buildings exclusively devoted to prayer.\r\n\r\nThe princes of the Tartar races, in carrying out their love of tombs,\r\nmade it the practice to build their own in their lifetime, as all\r\npeople must who are really desirous of sepulchral magnificence. In\r\ndoing this they rejected the Egyptian mode of preparing dark and deep\r\nchambers in the heart of the rock, or of the massive pyramid. The\r\nTartars, on the other hand, built their sepulchres of such a character\r\nas to serve for places of enjoyment for themselves and their friends\r\nduring their lifetime, and only when they could enjoy them no longer\r\nthey became the solemn resting-places of their mortal remains.\r\n\r\nThe usual process for the erection of these structures is for the king\r\nor noble who intends to provide himself a tomb to enclose a garden\r\noutside the city walls, generally with high crenellated walls, and with\r\none or more splendid gateways; and in the centre of this he erects a\r\nsquare or octagonal building, crowned by a dome, and in the more\r\nsplendid examples with smaller and dome-roofed apartments on four of the\r\nsides or angles, the other four being devoted to entrances. This\r\nbuilding is generally situated on a lofty square terrace, from which\r\nradiate four broad alleys, generally with marble-paved canals ornamented\r\nwith fountains; the angular spaces are planted with cypresses and other\r\nevergreens and fruit-trees, making up one of those formal but beautiful\r\ngardens so characteristic of the East. During the lifetime of the\r\nfounder, the central building is called a Barrah Durrie, or festal hall,\r\nand is used as a place of recreation and feasting by him and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAt his death its destination is changed--the founder’s remains are\r\ninterred beneath the central dome. Sometimes his favourite wife lies\r\nbeside him; but more generally his family and relations are buried\r\nbeneath the collateral domes. When once used as a place of burial, its\r\nvaults never again resound with festive mirth. The care of the building\r\nis handed over to priests and cadis, who gain a scanty subsistence by\r\nthe sale of the fruits of the garden, or the alms of those who come to\r\nvisit the last resting-place of their friend or master. Perfect silence\r\ntakes the place of festivity and mirth. The beauty of the surrounding\r\nobjects combines with the repose of the place to produce an effect as\r\ngraceful as it is solemn and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThough the tombs, with the remains of their enclosures, are so numerous\r\nthroughout all India, the Taje Mehal, at Agra, is almost the only tomb\r\nthat retains its garden in anything like its pristine beauty, and there\r\nis not perhaps in the whole world a scene where nature and art so\r\nsuccessfully combine to produce a perfect work of art as within the\r\nprecincts of this far-famed mausoleum.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Humayun Shah, the first of the Moguls who was buried in\r\nIndia, still stands tolerably entire among the ruins of Old Delhi, of\r\nwhich indeed it forms the principal and most striking object. It stands\r\nwell on a lofty square platform, adorned with arches, whose piers are\r\nornamented with an inlay of white marble. The tomb itself is an\r\noctagonal apartment, of considerable dimensions, crowned by a dome of\r\nwhite marble, of very graceful contour externally. Four sides of the\r\noctagon are occupied by the entrances; to the other four smaller\r\noctagonal apartments are attached, making up a building nearly a square\r\nin plan, with only the angles slightly cut away.[543] Its plan is in\r\nfact that afterwards adopted at the Taje (Woodcut No. 338), but used\r\nhere without the depth and poetry of that celebrated building. Its most\r\nmarked characteristic, however, is its purity--it might almost be called\r\npoverty--of design. It is so very unlike anything else that Akbar ever\r\nbuilt, that it is hardly possible it could have been designed by him. It\r\nhas not even the picturesque boldness of the earlier Pathan tombs, and\r\nin fact looks more like buildings a century at least more modern than it\r\nreally is. It is, however, a noble tomb, and anywhere else must be\r\nconsidered a wonder.\r\n\r\nHumayun’s tomb, however, is so well known from drawings and photographs,\r\nthat, in order to illustrate the architecture of the day, it may be\r\npreferable to take the contemporary tomb of Mohammad Ghaus at Gualior,\r\nwhich certainly was erected during the early part of Akbar’s reign, and\r\nis a singularly interesting example of the tombs of the period. It is a\r\nsquare, measuring 100 ft. each way, exclusive of the hexagonal towers,\r\nwhich are attached to the angles (Woodcut No. 327). The chamber of the\r\ntomb itself is a hall 43 ft. square, with the angles cut off by pointed\r\narches so as to form an octagon, on which the dome rests. Around this\r\nsquare building is a gallery, 20 ft. wide between the piers, enclosed on\r\nall sides by a screen of the most exquisite tracery in pierced\r\nstone-work with a projecting porch on each face (Woodcut No. 328).[544]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 327. Plan of Tomb of Mohammad Ghaus, Gualior. Scale 50\r\nft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nOn comparing this with the tomb of Shere Shah at Sasseram, which in many\r\nrespects it resembles to a considerable extent, it will be seen that it\r\nmarks a considerable progress in tomb-building during even the short\r\nperiod that elapsed between the erection of the two. There is an\r\ninherent weakness in an octagonal form as compared with the square, that\r\neven the Pathans never quite successfully conquered; and the outward\r\nscreen of trellis-work is far more elegant than the open arcade of the\r\nSasseram tomb. Something may be due to the fact that Gualior was a city\r\nwhere building of an ornamental character had long been going on, and\r\nwhere consequently a superior school of masons and architects may always\r\nhave existed, while Sasseram was a remote country village, where these\r\nadvantages were unknown. But be this as it may, the progress is such in\r\nso short a time, that we can only ascribe it to the invigorating touch\r\nof Akbar’s genius, which was afterwards to work such wonders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 328. Tomb of Mohammad Ghaus, Gualior. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and characteristic of Akbar’s buildings is\r\nthe old or Red Palace in the fort, so called from being constructed\r\nentirely of red sandstone, unfortunately not a very good quality, and\r\nconsequently much of its ornament has peeled off. It is a square\r\nbuilding, measuring 249 ft. by 260 ft. In the centre is a courtyard, 71\r\nft. by 72 ft., on either side of which are two halls facing one another.\r\nThe largest, 62 ft. by 37 ft., has a flat ceiling of stone, divided into\r\npanels, and supported by struts of purely Hindu design, very similar to\r\nthose used in the palaces of Mân Sing and Vicramaditya at Gualior. Every\r\nfeature around this court is indeed of pure Hindu architecture. No\r\narches appear anywhere, but the horizontal style of construction\r\neverywhere. The ornamentation, too, which is carved on all the flat\r\nsurfaces, is of a class used by Akbar, but not found in the buildings of\r\nothers. Indeed, throughout this palace arches are used so sparingly, and\r\nHindu forms and Hindu construction prevail to such an extent, that it\r\nwould hardly be out of place at Chittore or Gualior, though it still\r\nbears that impress of vigour and originality that he and he only knew\r\nhow to impress on all his works.[545]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, at Futtehpore Sikri that Akbar must be judged of as a\r\nbuilder. During the whole of his reign it was his favourite residence.\r\nHe apparently was the first to occupy the spot, and apparently the last,\r\nat least, to build there, no single building being identified as having\r\nbeen erected by any of his successors.\r\n\r\nAkbar seems to have had no settled plan when he commenced building\r\nthere. The original part of the building seems to be the Khas Mehal, a\r\nsquare block of building measuring about 260 ft. each way, and therefore\r\nof about the same dimensions as the Red Palace in the fort at Agra. Its\r\ncourtyard, however, is larger, about 170 ft. each way, and the buildings\r\nthat surround it very inferior in richness of design and ornamentation.\r\nThis, however, is far more than compensated for by the courts and\r\npavilions that he added from time to time. There is the Dewanni Khas, or\r\nthrone-room, a square building with a throne consisting of an enormous\r\nflower-like bracket, supported on a richly-carved pillar;[546] a\r\nperistylar building, called his office, very similar to one he erected\r\nat Allahabad, to be mentioned hereafter; a five-storeyed open pavilion,\r\nall the pillars of which are most richly carved, and long colonnades and\r\nwalls connecting these with one another. The richest, the most\r\nbeautiful, as well as the most characteristic of all his buildings here\r\nare three small pavilions, said to have been erected to please and\r\naccommodate his three favourite sultanas: hence called Bîr Bul ka Beti\r\nka Mehal, for his Hindu wife, the daughter of his favourite minister,\r\nBîr Bul; Miriam’s House, appropriated to his Christian consort; and the\r\npalace of the Roumi Sultana. They are small, but it is impossible to\r\nconceive anything so picturesque in outline, or any building carved and\r\nornamented to such an extent, without the smallest approach to being\r\noverdone or in bad taste. The two pillars shown in the annexed woodcut,\r\nare from a cast from the last-named pavilion, which is now in the South\r\nKensington Museum. It is, perhaps, the most elaborate of the three; but\r\nthe other two are generally in better taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 329. Carved Pillars in the Sultana’s Kiosk, Futtehpore\r\nSikri. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe glory, however, of Futtehpore Sikri is its mosque, which is hardly\r\nsurpassed by any in India (Woodcut No. 330). It measures 550 ft. east\r\nand west, by 470 ft. north and south over all. The mosque itself, 290\r\nft. by 80 ft., is crowned by three domes. In its courtyard, which\r\nmeasures 350 ft. by 440 ft., stand two tombs: that of Selim Chisti,\r\nwholly in white marble, and the windows with pierced tracery of the most\r\nexquisite geometrical patterns--flowing tracery is a subsequent\r\ninvention. It possesses besides a deep cornice of marble supported by\r\nbrackets of the most elaborate design, so much so indeed as to be almost\r\nfantastic--the only approach to bad taste in the place; the other tomb,\r\nthat of Islam Khan, is soberer and in excellent taste, but quite\r\neclipsed by its surroundings. Even these parts, however, are surpassed\r\nin magnificence by the southern gateway, measuring 130 ft. by 85 ft. in\r\nplan, and of proportionate dimensions in height (Woodcut No. 331). As it\r\nstands on a rising ground, when looked at from below, its appearance is\r\nnoble beyond that of any portal attached to any mosque in India, perhaps\r\nin the whole world. This gateway may also be quoted as a perfectly\r\nsatisfactory solution of a problem which has exercised the ingenuity of\r\narchitects in all ages, but was more successfully treated by the\r\nSaracenic architects than by any others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 330. Mosque at Futtehpore Sikri. (From a Plan by Lieut.\r\nCole, R.E.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 331. Southern Gateway of Mosque, Futtehpore Sikri. (From\r\na Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nIt was always manifest that to give a large building a door at all in\r\nproportion to its dimensions was, to say the least of it, very\r\ninconvenient. Men are only 6 ft. high, and they do not want portals\r\nthrough which elephants might march. The Greeks never ventured,\r\nhowever, to reduce the proportionate size of their portals, though it\r\nmay be they only opened the lower half, and they covered them, in almost\r\nall instances, with porticos to give them a dignity that even their\r\ndimensions failed to impart.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic architects tried, by splaying their deeply-embowed doorways,\r\nand by ornamenting them richly with carving and sculpture, to give them\r\nthe dignity that was indispensable for their situation without\r\nunnecessarily increasing the size of the openings. It was left, however,\r\nfor the Saracenic architects completely to get over the difficulty. They\r\nplaced their portals--one, or three, or five, of very moderate\r\ndimensions--at the back of a semi-dome. This last feature thus became\r\nthe porch or portico, and its dimensions became those of the portal,\r\nwholly irrespective of the size of the opening. No one, for instance,\r\nlooking at this gateway can mistake that it is a doorway and that only,\r\nand no one thinks of the size of the openings which are provided at its\r\nbase. The semi-dome is the modulus of the design, and its scale that by\r\nwhich the imagination measures its magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe same system pervades almost all the portals of the age and style,\r\nand always with a perfectly satisfactory result--sometimes even more\r\nsatisfactory than in this instance, though it may be in less\r\nproportionate dimensions. The principle seems the best that has yet been\r\nhit upon, and, when that is right, failure is as difficult, as it is to\r\nachieve success when the principle of the design is wrong.\r\n\r\nTaking it altogether, this palace at Futtehpore Sikri is a romance in\r\nstone, such as few--very few--are to be found anywhere; and it is a\r\nreflex of the mind of the great man who built it more distinct than can\r\neasily be obtained from any other source.[547]\r\n\r\nAllahabad was a more favourite residence of this monarch than Agra,\r\nperhaps as much so as even Futtehpore Sikri; but the English having\r\nappropriated the fort, its glories have been nearly obliterated. The\r\nmost beautiful thing was the pavilion of the Chalîs Sitûn, or forty\r\npillars, so called from its having that number on the principal floor,\r\ndisposed in two concentric octagonal ranges, one internal of sixteen\r\npillars, the other outside of twenty-four. Above this, supported by the\r\ninner colonnade, was an upper range of the same number of pillars\r\ncrowned by a dome. This building has entirely disappeared, its materials\r\nbeing wanted to repair the fortifications. The great hall, however,\r\nstill remains, represented in the annexed woodcut (No. 332). It is now\r\nthe arsenal; a brick wall has been run up between its outer colonnades\r\nwith windows of English architecture, and its curious pavilions and\r\nother accompaniments removed; and internally, whatever could not be\r\nconveniently cut away is carefully covered up with plaster and\r\nwhitewash, and hid by stands of arms and deal fittings. Still its plan\r\ncan be made out; a square hall supported by eight rows of columns, eight\r\nin each row, thus making in all sixty-four, surrounded by a deep\r\nverandah of double columns, with groups of four at the angles, all\r\nsurmounted by bracket capitals of the most elegant and richest design,\r\nand altogether as fine in style and as rich in ornament as anything in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 332. Hall in Palace at Allahabad. (From a Drawing by\r\nDaniell.)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the most characteristic of Akbar’s buildings is the\r\ntomb he commenced to erect for himself at Secundra, near Agra, which is\r\nquite unlike any other tomb built in India either before or since, and\r\nof a design borrowed, as I believe, from a Hindu, or more correctly,\r\nBuddhist, model. It stands in an extensive garden, still kept up,\r\napproached by one noble gateway. In the centre of this garden, on a\r\nraised platform, stands the tomb itself, of a pyramidal form. The lower\r\nstorey measures 320 ft. each way, exclusive of the angle towers. It is\r\n30 ft. in height, and pierced by ten great arches on each face, and with\r\na larger entrance adorned with a mosaic of marble in the centre\r\n(Woodcuts Nos. 333, 334).[548]\r\n\r\nOn this terrace stands another far more ornate, measuring 186 ft. on\r\neach side, and 14 ft. 9 in. in height. A third and fourth, of similar\r\ndesign, and respectively 15 ft. 2 in. and 14 ft. 6 in. high, stand on\r\nthis, all these being of red sandstone. Within and above the last is a\r\nwhite marble enclosure 157 ft. each way, or externally just half the\r\nlength of the lowest terrace, its outer wall entirely composed of marble\r\ntrellis-work of the most beautiful patterns. Inside it is surrounded by\r\na colonnade or cloister of the same material, in the centre of which, on\r\na raised platform, is the tombstone of the founder, a splendid piece of\r\nthe most beautiful arabesque tracery. This, however, is not the true\r\nburial-place; but the mortal remains of this great king repose under a\r\nfar plainer tombstone in a vaulted chamber in the basement 35 ft.\r\nsquare, exactly under the simulated tomb that adorns the summit of the\r\nmausoleum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 333. Plan of Akbar’s Tomb at Secundra. (From a Plan by\r\nthe Author.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight it might appear that the design of this curious and\r\nexceptional tomb was either a caprice of the monarch who built it, or an\r\nimportation from abroad (Woodcut No. 335). My impression, on the\r\ncontrary, is, that it is a direct imitation of some such building as the\r\nold Buddhist viharas which may have existed, applied to other purposes\r\nin Akbar’s time. Turning back, for instance, to Woodcuts Nos. 66 and\r\n181, representing the great rath at Mahavellipore, it will be seen that\r\nthe number and proportion of the storeys is the same. The pavilions that\r\nadorn the upper storeys of Akbar’s tomb appear distinct reminiscences of\r\nthe cells that stand on the edge of each platform of the rock-cut\r\nexample. If the tomb had been crowned by a domical chamber over the\r\ntombstone, the likeness would have been so great that no one could\r\nmistake it, and my conviction is, that such a chamber was part of the\r\noriginal design. No such royal tomb remains exposed to the air in any\r\nIndian mausoleum; and the raised platform in the centre of the upper\r\ncloister, 38 ft. square, looks so like its foundation that I cannot help\r\nbelieving it was intended for that purpose. As the monument now stands,\r\nthe pyramid has\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 334. Diagram Section[549] of one-half of Akbar’s Tomb at\r\nSecundra, explanatory of its Arrangements. Scale 50 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\na truncated and unmeaning aspect. The total height of the building now\r\nis a little more than 100 ft. to the top of the angle pavilions; and a\r\ncentral dome 30 or 40 ft. higher, which is the proportion that the base\r\ngives, seems just what is wanted to make this tomb as beautiful in\r\noutline and in proportion as it is in detail. Had it been so completed,\r\nit certainly would have ranked next the Taje among Indian\r\nmausolea.[550]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 335. View of Akbar’s Tomb, Secundra. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nJEHANGIR, A.D. 1605-1628.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider how much was done by his father and his son, it is\r\nrather startling to find how little Jehangir contributed to the\r\narchitectural magnificence of India. Partly this may be owing to his not\r\nhaving the same passion for building which characterised these two great\r\nmonarchs; but partly also to his having made Lahore the capital during\r\nhis reign, and to his having generally resided there in preference to\r\nAgra or Delhi. The great mosque there, however, which was built by him,\r\nseems to be equal in magnificence to that built by Shah Jehan at Delhi.\r\nThis mosque, however, seems to have been surpassed by one erected in the\r\ncity of Lahore by his vizir. It is in the Persian style, covered with\r\nenamelled tiles, and resplendent in colours, but not very graceful in\r\nform. His tomb, in which he lies buried with his queen, the imperious\r\nNurjehan, was worthy of its builder, but has been used as a quarry by\r\nthe Sikhs, and half the splendour of the temple at Amritsir is due to\r\nmarbles plundered from this mausoleum. The palace, too, which he\r\nerected, was worthy of his other buildings, but it has suffered as much\r\nas the rest. It has been used as a habitation from that time to this,\r\nand so altered, to adapt it to the wants of its successive occupants,\r\nthat little of its original form remains.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, no measurements and no information about these\r\nmonuments which would enable us to speak with any confidence either\r\nregarding them, or the other buildings of that city, which seems to owe\r\nits principal splendour to the reign of this monarch.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of his dominions also he built a splendid new capital\r\nat Dacca, in supersession to Gaur, and adorned it with several buildings\r\nof considerable dimensions. These, however, were principally in\r\nbrick-work, covered with stucco, and with only pillars and brackets in\r\nstone. Most of them, consequently, are in a state of ruinous decay;\r\nmarvellously picturesque, it must be confessed, peering through the\r\nluxuriant vegetation that is tearing them to pieces, but hardly worthy\r\nto be placed in competition with the stone and marble buildings of the\r\nmore northern capitals.\r\n\r\nThere is one building--the tomb known as that of Eti-mad-Doulah--at\r\nAgra, however, which certainly belongs to this reign, and, though not\r\nerected by the monarch himself, cannot be passed over, not only from its\r\nown beauty of design, but also because it marks an epoch in the style to\r\nwhich it belongs. It is situated on the left bank of the river, in the\r\nmidst of a garden surrounded by a wall measuring 540 ft. on each side.\r\nIn the centre of this, on a raised platform, stands the tomb itself, a\r\nsquare measuring 69 ft. on each side. It is two storeys in height, and\r\nat each angle is an octagonal tower, surmounted by an open pavilion. The\r\ntowers, however, are rather squat in proportion, and the general design\r\nof the building very far from being so pleasing as that of many less\r\npretentious tombs in the neighbourhood. Had it, indeed, been built in\r\nred sandstone, or even with an inlay of white marble like that of\r\nHumayun, it would not have attracted much attention. Its real merit\r\nconsists in being wholly in white marble, and being covered throughout\r\nwith a mosaic in “pietro duro”--the first, apparently, and certainly one\r\nof the most splendid, examples of that class of ornamentation in India.\r\n\r\nIt seems now to be ascertained that in the early part of the 17th\r\ncentury Italian artists, principally, apparently from Florence, were\r\nintroduced into India, and taught the Indians the art of inlaying marble\r\nwith precious stones.[551] No instance of this mode of decoration\r\noccurs, so far as I know, in the reign of Akbar; but in that of Shah\r\nJehan it became the leading characteristic of the style, and both his\r\npalaces and his tombs owe their principal distinction to the beauty of\r\nthe mode in which this new invention was employed.\r\n\r\nIt has been doubted whether this new art was really a foreign\r\nintroduction, or whether it had not been invented by the natives of\r\nIndia themselves. The question never, probably, would have arisen had\r\none of the fundamental principles of architecture been better\r\nunderstood. When we, for instance, having no art of our own, copy a\r\nGrecian or Roman pillar, or an Italian mediæval arch in detail, we do so\r\nliterally, without any attempt to adapt it to our uses or climate; but\r\nwhen a people having a style of their own wish to adopt any feature or\r\nprocess belonging to any other style, they do not copy but adapt it to\r\ntheir uses; and it is this distinction between adopting and adapting\r\nthat makes all the difference. We would have allowed the Italians to\r\nintroduce with their mosaics all the details of their Cinque-cento\r\narchitecture. The Indians set them to reproduce, with their new\r\nmaterials and processes, the patterns which the architects of Akbar had\r\nbeen in the habit of carving in stone or of inlaying in marble. Every\r\nform was adapted to the place where it was to be used. The style\r\nremained the same, so did all the details; the materials only were\r\nchanged, and the patterns only so far as was necessary to adapt them to\r\nthe smaller and more refined materials that were to be used.[552]\r\n\r\nAs one of the first, the tomb of Eti-mad-Doulah was certainly one of the\r\nleast successful specimens of its class. The patterns do not quite fit\r\nthe places where they are put, and the spaces are not always those best\r\nsuited for this style of decoration. Altogether I cannot help fancying\r\nthat the Italians had more to do with the design of this building than\r\nwas at all desirable, and they are to blame for its want of grace. But,\r\non the other hand, the beautiful tracery of the pierced marble slabs of\r\nits windows, which resemble those of Selim Chisti’s tomb at Futtehpore\r\nSikri, the beauty of its white marble walls, and the rich colour of its\r\ndecorations, make up so beautiful a whole, that it is only on comparing\r\nit with the works of Shah Jehan that we are justified in finding fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAH JEHAN, A.D. 1628-1658.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to point out in the whole history of architecture\r\nany change so sudden as that which took place between the style of Akbar\r\nand that of his grandson Shah Jehan--nor any contrast so great as that\r\nbetween the manly vigour and exuberant originality of the first, as\r\ncompared with the extreme but almost effeminate elegance of the second.\r\nCertainly when the same people, following the same religion, built\r\ntemples and palaces in the same locality, nothing of the sort ever\r\noccurred in any country whose history is now known to us.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the contrast between the two styles more strongly marked than\r\nin the palace of Agra--from the red stone palace of Akbar, with its rich\r\nsculptures and square Hindu construction, a door opens into the white\r\nmarble court of the hareem of Shah Jehan, with all its feeble\r\nprettiness, but at the same time marked with that peculiar elegance\r\nwhich is found only in the East. The court is not large, 170 ft. by 235\r\nft., but the whole is finished with the most elaborate care. Three sides\r\nof this are occupied by the residences of the ladies, not remarkable for\r\nsize, nor, in their present state, for architectural beauty; but the\r\nfourth, overhanging the river, is occupied by three white marble\r\npavilions of singular elegance, though it is not easy now to see them,\r\nsome English officer having pitched upon the principal one as a\r\nresidence, and having in consequence covered the polished marble and\r\nelegant arabesques of flowers inlaid in precious stones with thick\r\ncoatings of that whitewash which was indispensable to his idea of\r\ncomfort and elegant simplicity.\r\n\r\nAs in most Moorish palaces, the baths on one side of this court were the\r\nmost elegant and elaborately decorated apartments in the palace. The\r\nbaths have been destroyed, but the walls and roofs still show the\r\nelegance with which they were adorned.[553]\r\n\r\nBehind this, in the centre of the palace, is a great court, 500 ft. by\r\n370 ft. surrounded by arcades, and approached at the opposite ends\r\nthrough a succession of beautiful courts opening into one another by\r\ngateways of great magnificence. One one side of this court is the great\r\nhall of the palace--the Dewanni Aum--208 ft. by 76 ft., supported by\r\nthree ranges of arcades of exquisite beauty. It is open on three sides,\r\nand with a niche for the throne at the back. This, like the hall at\r\nAllahabad, is now an arsenal, and reduced to as near a similarity as\r\npossible to those in our dockyards.[554] Behind it are two smaller\r\ncourts, the one containing the Dewanni Khas, or private hall of\r\naudience, the other the hareem. The hall in the former is one of the\r\nmost elegant of Shah Jehan’s buildings, being wholly of white marble\r\ninlaid with precious stones, and the design of the whole being in the\r\nbest style of his reign.\r\n\r\nOne of the most picturesque features about this palace is a marble\r\npavilion, in two storeys, that surmounts one of the circular bastions on\r\nthe river face, between the hareem and the Dewanni Khas. It looks of an\r\nearlier style than that of Shah Jehan, and if Jehangir built anything\r\nhere it is this. On a smaller scale, it occupies the same place here\r\nthat the Chalîs Sitûn did in the palace at Allahabad; and exemplifies,\r\neven more than in their larger buildings, the extreme elegance and\r\nrefinement of those who designed these palaces.[555]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALACE AT DELHI.\r\n\r\nThough the palace at Agra is perhaps more picturesque, and historically\r\ncertainly more interesting, than that of Delhi, the latter had the\r\nimmense advantage of being built at once, on one uniform plan, and by\r\nthe most magnificent, as a builder, of all the sovereigns of India. It\r\nhad, however, one little disadvantage, in being somewhat later than\r\nAgra. All Shah Jehan’s buildings there, seem to have been finished\r\nbefore he commenced the erection of the new city of Shah Jehanabad with\r\nits palace, and what he built at Agra is soberer, and in somewhat better\r\ntaste than at Delhi. Notwithstanding these defects, the palace at Delhi\r\nis, or rather was, the most magnificent palace in the East--perhaps in\r\nthe world--and the only one, at least in India, which enables us to\r\nunderstand what the arrangements of a complete palace were when\r\ndeliberately undertaken and carried out on one uniform plan (Woodcut No.\r\n336).\r\n\r\nThe palace at Delhi, which is situated like that at Agra close to the\r\nedge of the Jumna, is a nearly regular parallelogram, with the angles\r\nslightly canted off, and measures 1600 ft. east and west, by 3200 ft.\r\nnorth and south, exclusive of the gateways. It is surrounded on all\r\nsides by a very noble wall of red sandstone, relieved at intervals by\r\ntowers surmounted by kiosks. The principal entrance faces the Chandni\r\nChowk, a noble wide street, nearly a mile long, planted with two rows of\r\ntrees, and with a stream of water running down its centre. Entering\r\nwithin its deeply-recessed portal, you find yourself\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 336. Palace at Delhi. (From a native Plan in the\r\npossession of the Author.)]\r\n\r\nbeneath the vaulted hall, the sides of which are in two storeys, and\r\nwith an octagonal break in the centre. This hall, which is 375 ft. in\r\nlength over all, has very much the effect of the nave of a gigantic\r\nGothic cathedral, and forms the noblest entrance known to belong to any\r\nexisting palace. At its inner end this hall opened into a courtyard, 350\r\nft. square, from the centre of which a noble bazaar extended right and\r\nleft, like the hall, two storeys in height, but not vaulted. One of\r\nthese led to the Delhi gate, the other, which I believe was never quite\r\nfinished, to the garden. In front, at the entrance, was the Nobut Khana\r\n(A), or music hall, beneath which the visitor entered the second or\r\ngreat court of the palace, measuring 550 ft. north and south, by 385 ft.\r\neast and west. In the centre of this stood the Dewanni Aum (B), or great\r\naudience hall of the palace, very similar in design to that at Agra, but\r\nmore magnificent. Its dimensions are, as nearly as I can ascertain, 200\r\nft. by 100 ft. over all. In its centre is a highly ornamental niche, in\r\nwhich, on a platform of marble richly inlaid with precious stones,[556]\r\nand directly facing the entrance, once stood the celebrated peacock\r\nthrone, the most gorgeous example of its class that perhaps even the\r\nEast could ever boast of. Behind this again was a garden-court; on its\r\neastern side was the Rung Mehal (C), or painted hall, containing a bath\r\nand other apartments.\r\n\r\nThis range of buildings, extending 1600 ft. east and west, divided the\r\npalace into two nearly equal halves. In the northern division of it were\r\na series of small courts, surrounded by buildings apparently\r\nappropriated to the use of distinguished guests; and in one of them\r\noverhanging the river stood the celebrated Dewanni Khas (D), or private\r\naudience hall--if not the most beautiful, certainly the most highly\r\nornamented of all Shah Jehan’s buildings. It is larger certainly, and\r\nfar richer in ornament than that at Agra, though hardly so elegant in\r\ndesign; but nothing can exceed the beauty of the inlay of precious\r\nstones with which it is adorned, or the general poetry of the design. It\r\nis round the roof of this hall that the famous inscription runs: “If\r\nthere is a heaven on earth it is this, it is this,” which may safely be\r\nrendered into the sober English assertion, that no palace now existing\r\nin the world possesses an apartment of such singular elegance as this.\r\n\r\nBeyond this to the northward were the gardens of the palace, laid out in\r\nthe usual formal style of the East, but adorned with fountains and\r\nlittle pavilions and kiosks of white marble, that render these so\r\nbeautiful and so appropriate to such a climate.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the area between the central range of buildings to the\r\nsouth, and eastward from the bazaar, measuring about 1000 ft. each way,\r\nwas occupied by the hareem and private apartments of the palace,\r\ncovering, consequently, more than twice the area of the Escurial, or, in\r\nfact, of any palace in Europe. According to the native plan I possess,\r\nwhich I see no reason for distrusting, it contained three garden courts,\r\nand some thirteen or fourteen other courts, arranged some for state,\r\nsome for convenience; but what they were like we have no means of\r\nknowing. Not one vestige of them now remains. Judging from the\r\ncorresponding parts of the palace at Agra, built by the same monarch,\r\nthey must have vied with the public apartments in richness and in beauty\r\nwhen originally erected, but having continued to be used as an abode\r\ndown to the time of the mutiny, they were probably very much disfigured\r\nand debased. Taste was, no doubt, at as low an ebb inside the walls of\r\nthe palace during the last hundred years as it was outside, or as we\r\nfind it at Lucknow and elsewhere; but all the essential parts of the\r\nstructure were there, and could easily have been disencumbered from the\r\naccretions that had been heaped upon it. The idea, however, of doing\r\nthis was far from entering into the heads of our governors. The whole of\r\nthe hareem courts of the palace were swept off the face of the earth to\r\nmake way for a hideous British barrack, without those who carried out\r\nthis fearful piece of Vandalism thinking it even worth while to make a\r\nplan of what they were destroying, or preserving any record of the most\r\nsplendid palace in the world.\r\n\r\nOf the public parts of the palace all that now remains is the entrance\r\nhall, the Nobut Khana, the Dewanni Aum and Khas, and the Rung Mehal--now\r\nused as a mess-room--and one or two small pavilions. They are the gems\r\nof the palace, it is true, but without the courts and corridors\r\nconnecting them they lose all their meaning and more than half their\r\nbeauty.[557] Being now situated in the middle of a British barrack-yard,\r\nthey look like precious stones torn from their settings in some\r\nexquisite piece of Oriental jeweller’s work and set at random in a bed\r\nof the commonest plaster.[558]\r\n\r\n\r\nTAJE MEHAL.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to turn from this destroyed and desecrated palace to\r\nthe Taje Mehal, which even more, perhaps, than the palace was always the\r\nchef-d’œuvre of Shah Jehan’s reign (Woodcut No. 337). It, too, has been\r\nfortunate in attracting the attention of the English, who have paid\r\nsedulous attention to it for some time past, and keep it now, with its\r\ngardens, in a perfect state of substantial repair.\r\n\r\nNo building in India has been so often drawn and photographed as this,\r\nor more frequently described; but, with all this, it is almost\r\nimpossible to convey an idea of it to those who have not seen it, not\r\nonly because of its extreme delicacy, and beauty of material employed in\r\nits construction, but from the complexity of its design. If the Taje\r\nwere only the tomb itself, it might be described, but the platform on\r\nwhich it stands, with its tall minarets, is a work of art in itself.\r\nBeyond this are the two wings, one of which is a mosque, which anywhere\r\nelse would be considered an important building. This group of buildings\r\nforms one side of a garden court 880 ft. square; and beyond this again\r\nan outer court, of the same width but only half the depth. This is\r\nentered by three gateways of its own, and contains in the centre of its\r\ninner wall the great gateway of the garden court, a worthy pendant to\r\nthe Taje itself.[559] Beautiful as it is in itself, the Taje would lose\r\nhalf its charm if it stood alone. It is the combination of so many\r\nbeauties, and the perfect manner in which each is subordinated to the\r\nother, that makes up a whole which the world cannot match, and which\r\nnever fails to impress even those who are most indifferent to the\r\neffects produced by architectural objects in general.\r\n\r\nThe plan and section (Woodcuts Nos. 338, 339) explain sufficiently the\r\ngeneral arrangement and structural peculiarities of the tomb or\r\nprincipal building of the group. The raised platform on which it stands\r\nis 18 ft. high, faced with white marble, and exactly 313 ft. square. At\r\neach corner of this terrace stands a minaret 133 ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 337. View of Taje Mehal. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 338. Plan of Taje Mehal, Agra. (From a Plan by the\r\nAuthor.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 339. Section of Taje Mehal, Agra. Scale 110 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nin height, and of the most exquisite proportions, more beautiful,\r\nperhaps, than any other in India. In the centre of this marble platform\r\nstands the mausoleum, a square of 186 ft., with the corners cut off to\r\nthe extent of 33 ft. 9 in. The centre of this is occupied by the\r\nprincipal dome, 58 ft. in diameter and 80 ft. in height, under which is\r\nan enclosure formed by a screen of trellis-work of white marble, a\r\nchef-d’œuvre of elegance in Indian art.[560] Within this stand the\r\ntombs--that of Mûmtaz-i-Mehal in the centre, and that of Shah Jehan on\r\none side. These, however, as is usual in Indian sepulchres, are not the\r\ntrue tombs--the bodies rest in a vault, level with the surface of the\r\nground (as seen in the section) beneath plainer tombstones, placed\r\nexactly underneath those in the hall above.\r\n\r\nIn every angle of the building is a small domical apartment of two\r\nstoreys in height, 26 ft. 8 in. in diameter, and these are connected, as\r\nshown in the plan, by various passages and halls.\r\n\r\nThe light to the central apartment is admitted only through double\r\nscreens of white marble trellis-work of the most exquisite design, one\r\non the outer, and one on the inner face of the walls. In our climate\r\nthis would produce nearly complete darkness; but in India, and in a\r\nbuilding wholly composed of white marble, this was required to temper\r\nthe glare that otherwise would have been intolerable. As it is, no words\r\ncan express the chastened beauty of that central chamber, seen in the\r\nsoft gloom of the subdued light that reaches it through the distant and\r\nhalf-closed openings that surround it. When used as a Barrah Durrie, or\r\npleasure palace, it must always have been the coolest and the loveliest\r\nof garden retreats, and now that it is sacred to the dead it is the most\r\ngraceful and the most impressive of the sepulchres of the world.\r\n\r\nThis building, too, is an exquisite example of that system of inlaying\r\nwith precious stones which became the great characteristic of the style\r\nof the Moguls after the death of Akbar. All the spandrils of the Taje,\r\nall the angles and more important architectural details, are heightened\r\nby being inlaid with precious stones, such as agates, bloodstones,\r\njaspers, and the like. These are combined in wreaths, scrolls, and\r\nfrets, as exquisite in design as beautiful in colour; and, relieved by\r\nthe pure white marble in which they are inlaid, they form the most\r\nbeautiful and precious style of ornament ever adopted in architecture;\r\nthough, of course, not to be compared with the intellectual beauty of\r\nGreek ornament, it certainly stands first among the purely decorative\r\nforms of architectural design. This mode of ornamentation is lavishly\r\nbestowed on the tombs themselves and the screen that surrounds them,\r\nthough sparingly introduced on the mosque that forms one wing of the\r\nTaje, or on the fountains and surrounding buildings. The judgment,\r\nindeed, with which this style of ornament is apportioned to the various\r\nparts is almost as remarkable as the ornament itself, and conveys a high\r\nidea of the taste and skill of the Indian architects of that age.\r\n\r\nThe long rows of cypresses, which line the marble paths that intersect\r\nthe garden at right angles, are now of venerable age; and, backed up by\r\nmasses of evergreen foliage, lend a charm to the whole which the founder\r\nand his children could hardly have realised. Each of the main avenues\r\namong these trees has a canal along its centre studded with marble\r\nfountains, and each vista leads to some beautiful architectural object.\r\nWith the Jumna in front, and this garden with its fountains and gateways\r\nbehind; with its own purity of material and grace of form, the Taje may\r\nchallenge comparison with any creation of the same sort in the whole\r\nworld. Its beauty may not be of the highest class, but in its class it\r\nis unsurpassed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 340. Plan of Mûti Musjid. (From a Plan by Gen.\r\nCunningham.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThough neither so magnificent nor so richly ornamented as some of his\r\nother buildings, the Mûti Musjid, or Pearl Mosque, which Shah Jehan\r\nerected in the fort of Agra, is one of the purest and most elegant\r\nbuildings of its class to be found anywhere (Woodcut No. 340). It is not\r\nlarge, measuring only 187 ft. by 234 ft. over all externally; and though\r\nraised on a lofty stylobate, which ought to give it dignity, it makes no\r\npretentions to architectural effect on the outside; but the moment you\r\nenter by the eastern gateway the effect of its courtyard is surpassingly\r\nbeautiful. The whole is of white marble, and the forms all graceful and\r\nelegant. The only ornament introduced which is not strictly\r\narchitectural, is an inscription in black marble, inlaid in the frieze\r\nof the mosque itself. The courtyard is nearly a square, 154 ft. by 158\r\nft. On three sides it is surrounded by a low colonnade 10 ft. 10 in.\r\ndeep; but on the west, by the mosque itself, 159 ft. by 56 ft.\r\ninternally. It opens on the court by seven arches of great beauty, and\r\nis surmounted by three domes of the bulbous form that became universal\r\nabout this time (Woodcut No. 341). The woodcut cannot do it justice, it\r\nmust be seen to be appreciated; but I hardly know, anywhere, of a\r\nbuilding so perfectly pure and elegant, or one that forms such a\r\nwonderful contrast with the buildings of Akbar in the same palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 341. View in Courtyard of Mûti Musjid, Agra. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe Jumma Musjid at Delhi is not unlike the Mûti Musjid in plan, though\r\nbuilt on a very much larger scale, and adorned with two noble minarets,\r\nwhich are wanting in the Agra example; while from the somewhat\r\ncapricious admixture of red sandstone with white marble, it is far from\r\npossessing the same elegance and purity of effect. It is, however, one\r\nof the few mosques, either in India or elsewhere, that is designed to\r\nproduce a pleasing effect externally. As will be seen from the woodcut\r\n(No. 342), it is raised on a lofty basement, and its three gateways,\r\ncombined with the four angle-towers and the frontispiece and domes of\r\nthe mosque itself, make up a design where all the parts are pleasingly\r\nsubordinated to one another, but at the same time produce a whole of\r\ngreat variety and elegance. Its principal gateway cannot be compared\r\nwith that at Futtehpore Sikri (Woodcut No. 331); but it is a noble\r\nportal, and from its smaller dimensions more in harmony with the objects\r\nby which it is surrounded.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little singular, looking at the magnificent mosque\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 342. Great Mosque at Delhi from the N.E. (From a Sketch\r\nby the Author.)]\r\n\r\nwhich Akbar built in his palace at Futtehpore Sikri, and the Mûti\r\nMusjid, with which Shah Jehan adorned the palace at Agra, that he should\r\nhave provided no place of worship in his palace at Delhi. The little\r\nMûti mosque that is now found there was added by Aurungzebe, and, though\r\npretty enough in itself, is very small, only 60 ft. square over all, and\r\nutterly unworthy of such a palace. There is no place of prayer, within\r\nthe palace walls, of the time of Shah Jehan, nor, apparently, any\r\nintention of providing one. The Jumma Musjid was so near, and so\r\napparently part of the same design, that it seems to have been\r\nconsidered sufficient to supply this apparently anomalous deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURUNGZEBE, A.D. 1658-1707.\r\n\r\nThere are few things more startling in the history of this style than\r\nthe rapid decline of taste that set in with the accession of Aurungzebe.\r\nThe power of the Mogul empire reached its culminating point in his\r\nreign, and there were at least no external signs of decay visible before\r\nthe end of his reign. Even if his morose disposition did not lead him to\r\nspend much money on palaces or civil buildings, his religious fanaticism\r\nmight, one would think, have led him to surpass his predecessors in the\r\nextent or splendour of their mosques or religious establishments. This,\r\nhowever, is far from being the case. He did, indeed, as mentioned above,\r\npull down the temple of Vishveshwar, at Benares, in order to erect a\r\nmosque, whose tall and graceful minarets still form one of the most\r\nprominent features in every view of the city. It was not, however, from\r\nany love of architectural magnificence that this was done, but to insult\r\nhis Hindu subjects and mark the triumph of Islam over Hinduism. The\r\nmosque itself is of no great magnificence, but none more important was\r\nerected, so far as I know, during his reign.\r\n\r\nFew things can show how steadily and rapidly the decline of taste had\r\nset in than the fact that when that monarch was residing at Aurungabad\r\nbetween the years 1650-70, having lost his favourite daughter, Rabia\r\nDûranee, he ordered his architects to reproduce an exact copy of his\r\nfather’s celebrated tomb, the Taje Mehal, in honour of her memory. They\r\nbelieved they were doing so, but the difference between the two\r\nmonuments, even in so short an interval, is startling. The first stands\r\nalone in the world for certain qualities all can appreciate; the second\r\nis by no means remarkable for any qualities of elegance or design, and\r\nnarrowly escapes vulgarity and bad taste. In the beginning of the\r\npresent century a more literal copy of the Taje was erected in Lucknow\r\nover the tomb of one of its sovereigns. In this last, however, bad taste\r\nand tawdriness reign supreme. It is difficult to understand how a thing\r\ncan be so like in form and so unlike in spirit; but so it is, and these\r\nthree Tajes form a very perfect scale by which to measure the decline of\r\nart since the great Mogul dynasty passed its zenith and began its rapid\r\ndownward career.\r\n\r\nAurungzebe himself lies buried in a small hamlet just above the caves of\r\nEllora. The spot is esteemed sacred, but the tomb is mean and\r\ninsignificant beyond what would have sufficed for any of his nobles. He\r\nneglected, apparently, to provide for himself this necessary adjunct to\r\na Tartar’s glory, and his successors were too weak, even had they been\r\ninclined, to supply the omission. Strange to say, the sacred Tulsi-tree\r\nof the Hindus has taken root in a crevice of the brickwork, and is\r\nflourishing there as if in derision of the most bigoted persecutor the\r\nHindus ever experienced.\r\n\r\nWe have scarcely any remains of Aurungzebe’s own works, except, as\r\nbefore observed, a few additions to the palace at Delhi; but during his\r\nreign many splendid palaces were erected, both in the capital and\r\nelsewhere. The most extensive and splendid of these was that built by\r\nhis aspiring but unfortunate son Dara Shekoh. It, however, was converted\r\ninto the English residency; and so completely have improvements, with\r\nplaster and whitewash, done their work, that it requires some ingenuity\r\nto find out that it was not wholly the work of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Delhi many palaces of the age of Aurungzebe have escaped\r\nthis profanation, but generally they are either in ruins or used as\r\nshops; and with all their splendour show too clearly the degradation of\r\nstyle which had then fairly set in, and which is even more apparent in\r\nthe modern capitals of Oude, Hydrabad, and other cities which have risen\r\ninto importance during the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nEven these capitals, however, are not without edifices of a palatial\r\nclass, which from their size and the picturesqueness of their forms\r\ndeserve attention, and to an eye educated among the plaster glories of\r\nthe Alhambra would seem objects of no small interest and beauty. Few,\r\nhowever, are built of either marble or squared stone: most of them are\r\nof brick or rubble-stone, and the ornaments in stucco, which, coupled\r\nwith the inferiority of their design, will always prevent their being\r\nadmired in immediate proximity with the glories of Agra and Delhi.\r\n\r\nIn a history of Mahomedan art in India which had any pretensions to be\r\nexhaustive, it would be necessary to describe before concluding many\r\nminor buildings, especially tombs, which are found in every corner of\r\nthe land. For in addition to the Imperial tombs, mentioned above, the\r\nneighbourhoods of Agra and Delhi are crowded with those of the nobles of\r\nthe court, some of them scarcely less magnificent than the mausolea of\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nBesides the tombs, however, in the capitals of the empire, there is\r\nscarcely a city of any importance in the whole course of the Ganges or\r\nJumna, even as far eastward as Dacca, that does not possess some\r\nspecimens of this form of architectural magnificence. Jaunpore and\r\nAllahabad are particularly rich in examples; but Patna and Dacca possess\r\ntwo of the most pleasing of the smaller class of tombs that are to be\r\nmet with anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUDE AND MYSORE.\r\n\r\nIf it were worth while to engrave a sufficient number of illustrations\r\nto make the subject intelligible, one or two chapters might very easily\r\nbe filled with the architecture of these two dynasties. That of Mysore,\r\nthough only lasting forty years--A.D. 1760-1799--was sufficiently far\r\nremoved from European influence to practise a style retaining something\r\nof true architectural character. The pavilion called the Deriah Doulut\r\nat Seringapatam resembles somewhat the nearly contemporary palace at\r\nDeeg in style, but is feebler and of a much less ornamental\r\ncharacter.[561] The tomb, too, of the founder of the dynasty, and the\r\nsurrounding mausolea, retain a reminiscence of former greatness, but\r\nwill not stand comparison with the Imperial tombs of Agra and Delhi.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the tomb of Saftar Jung, the founder of the Lucknow\r\ndynasty, situated not far from the Kutub at Delhi, is not quite unworthy\r\nof the locality in which it is found. Though so late in date (A.D.\r\n1756), it looks grand and imposing at a distance, but it will not bear\r\nclose inspection. Even this qualified praise can hardly be awarded of\r\nany of the buildings in the capital in which his dynasty was finally\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIf mass and richness of ornamentation were in themselves sufficient to\r\nconstitute architecture, few capitals in India could show so much of it\r\nas Lucknow. It is, in fact, amazing to observe to what an extent this\r\ndynasty filled its capitals with gorgeous buildings during the one short\r\ncentury of its existence, but all--or with the fewest possible\r\nexceptions--in the worst possible taste. Whatever may be said of the\r\nRenaissance, or revival of classical architecture in Europe in the 16th\r\ncentury, in India it was an unmitigated misfortune. The unintelligent\r\nvulgarity with which the “Orders” are there used, by a people who were\r\ncapable of such noble things in their own styles, is one of the most\r\nstartling phenomena in the history of architecture. The subject hardly\r\nbelongs to this work, and has already been treated of in the ‘History of\r\nModern Architecture.’[562]\r\n\r\nEven at Lucknow, however, there are some buildings into which the\r\nEuropean leaven has not penetrated, and which are worthy of being\r\nmentioned in the same volume as the works of their ancestors. Among\r\nthese is the great Imambara, which, though its details will not bear too\r\nclose an examination, is still conceived on so grand a scale as to\r\nentitle it to rank with the buildings of an earlier age.\r\n\r\nAs seen by the plan of the Imambara (Woodcut No. 343), the principal\r\napartment is 162 ft. long by 53 ft. 6 in. wide. On the two sides are\r\nverandahs, respectively 26 ft. 6 in. and 27 ft. 3 in. wide, and at each\r\nend an octagonal apartment, 53 ft. in diameter, the whole interior\r\ndimensions being thus 263 ft. by 145 ft. This immense building is\r\ncovered with vaults of very simple form and still simpler construction,\r\nbeing of a rubble or coarse concrete several feet in thickness, which is\r\nlaid on a rude mould or centering of bricks and mud, and allowed to\r\nstand a year or two to set and dry. The centering is then removed, and\r\nthe vault, being in one piece, stands without abutment or thrust,\r\napparently a better and more durable form of roof than our most\r\nscientific Gothic vaulting; certainly far cheaper and far more easily\r\nmade, since it is literally cast on a mud form, which may be moulded\r\ninto any shape the fancy of the architect may dictate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 343. Plan of Imambara at Lucknow. (From Measurements by\r\nthe Author.) Scale 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious and instructive subject of speculation to try to\r\nascertain what would have been the fate of Mahomedan architecture in\r\nIndia had no European influence been brought to bear upon it. The\r\nmaterials for the inquiry are not abundant, but we can perceive that the\r\ndecadence had set in long before the death of Aurungzebe. It is also\r\nevident that in such buildings as were erected at Agra or Delhi during\r\nthe lapse of the 18th century, even where no European influence can be\r\ntraced, there is a feebleness and want of true perception, though\r\noccasionally combined with a considerable degree of elegance. There,\r\nhowever, the inquiry fails, because European influence made itself felt\r\nbefore any actual change had developed itself, but in remote\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 344. Tomb of the late Nawab of Junaghur. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\ncorners the downward progress became apparent without any extraneous\r\nassistance. This is partially the case, as just mentioned, in the\r\nMysore; but there is a cemetery at Junaghur, in Gujerat, where there\r\nexists a group of tombs, all erected within this century, some within\r\nthe last twenty or thirty years, which exhibit more nearly than any\r\nothers I am acquainted with the forms towards which the style was\r\ntending. The style is not without a certain amount of elegance in detail\r\n(Woodcut No. 344). The tracery of the windows is frequently fascinating\r\nfrom its beauty, and all the carving is executed with precision and\r\nappropriateness--but it is all wooden, or, in other words, every detail\r\nwould be more appropriate for a sideboard or a bedstead, or any article\r\nof upholstery, than for a building in stone. The domes especially can\r\nhardly be traced back to their grand and solemn form as used by the\r\nPathan architects. The pinnacles are fanciful, and the brackets designed\r\nmore for ornament than work. It is a style, in fact, broken loose from\r\nthe true principles of constructive design, and when this is the case,\r\nno amount of ornament, however elegant it may be, will redeem the want\r\nof propriety it inevitably exhibits.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, however, and instructive, in concluding our history of\r\narchitecture as practised within the limits of India properly so called,\r\nto observe how completely we have been walking in a circle. We began by\r\ntracing how, two hundred years before Christ, a wooden style was\r\ngradually assuming lithic forms, and by degrees being elaborated into a\r\nstyle where hardly a reminiscence of wood remained. We conclude with\r\nfinding the style of Hullabîd and Bijapur, or Delhi, returning to forms\r\nas appropriate to carpentry but as unsuited to masonry as the rails or\r\ngateways at Bharhut or Sanchi. It might some time ago have been a\r\nquestion worth mooting whether it was likely it would perish by\r\npersevering in this wrong direction. That enquiry, however, seems idle\r\nnow, as it is to be feared that the death-blow will be given, as at\r\nLucknow and elsewhere, by the fatal imitation of a foreign style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWOODEN ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nMosque of Shah Hamadan, Srinugger.\r\n\r\n\r\nKASHMIR.\r\n\r\nTurning for the nonce from this quasi-wooden style--which is only an\r\nindication of decadence and decrepitude--it would be pleasing if we\r\ncould finish our narrative with the description of a true wooden style\r\nas it exists in Kashmir. The Jumma Musjid, in the city of Srinugger, is\r\na large and important building, and if not so magnificent as some of\r\nthose described in the preceding pages, is of great interest from being\r\ndesigned to be constructed in wood, and wood only. A knowledge of its\r\npeculiarities would, consequently, help us much in understanding many\r\nproblems that arise in investigating the history of architecture in\r\nIndia. Unfortunately it is not a fashionable building, and of the 1001\r\ntourists who visit the valley no one mentions it, and no photographer\r\nhas yet set up his camera within its precincts.[563]\r\n\r\nIts plan apparently is the usual one: a courtyard surrounded by\r\ncloisters, longer and loftier on the side towards Mecca, its peculiarity\r\nbeing that all the pillars that support its roofs are of Deodar\r\npine--not used, of course, to imitate stone or stone construction, but\r\nhonest wooden forms, as in Burmese monasteries and elsewhere. The\r\ncarving on them is, I believe, rich and beautiful, and though\r\ndilapidated, the effect is said to be still singularly pleasing.\r\n\r\nThere is one other mosque in the same city, known as that of Shah\r\nHamadan (Woodcut No. 345), which is equally erected wholly in wood, and\r\nthough very much smaller than the Jumma Musjid, is interesting, in the\r\nfirst place, because its roof is probably very similar to that which\r\nonce covered the temple at Marttand (Woodcut No. 161), and the crowning\r\nornament is evidently a reminiscence of a Buddhist Tee, very much\r\naltered, it must be confessed, but still not so very unlike some found\r\nin Nepal, as at Swayambunath (Woodcut No. 170), for instance, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 345. Mosque of Shah Hamadan, Srinugger. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe walls, too, are of interest to us, because the mode in which the\r\nlogs are disposed and ornamented resembles the ornamentation of the\r\nOrissan temples more clearly than any stone forms we can call to mind.\r\nThe courses of the stone work in the tower of the great temple at\r\nBhuvaneswar (Woodcut No. 233), the Moitre Serai, and other temples\r\nthere, produce so nearly the same effect, that it does not seem\r\nimprobable they may have been derived from some such original. The mode,\r\ntoo, in which the Orissan temples are carved, and the extent to which\r\nthat class of ornamentation is carried, is much more suggestive of a\r\nwooden than of a lithic origin.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are questions that can only be profitably discussed when\r\nwe have more knowledge of this Kashmiri style than we now possess. When\r\nthe requisite materials are available for the purpose, there are few\r\nchapters that will be of greater interest, or that will more worthily\r\nconclude the Architectural History of India than those that treat of the\r\ntrue and false styles of wooden art, with which the narrative begins,\r\nand with which it also ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nFURTHER INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBURMAH.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nIntroductory--Ruins of Thatún, Prome, and Pagan--Circular\r\nDagobas--Monasteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nThe styles of architecture described in the preceding chapters of this\r\nvolume practically exhaust the enumeration of all those which were\r\npractised in India Proper, with its adjacent island of Ceylon, from the\r\nearliest dawn of our knowledge till the present day. It might,\r\ntherefore, be possible to treat their description as a work complete in\r\nitself, and to conclude without reference to other styles practised in\r\nneighbouring countries. It will add, however, immensely not only to the\r\ninterest but to the completeness of the work, if the history is\r\ncontinued through the architectural forms of those countries which\r\nadopted religions originating in India, and borrowed with them\r\narchitectural forms which expressed, with more or less distinctness, how\r\nfar their religious beliefs differed from, or agreed with, those of the\r\ncountry from which they were derived.\r\n\r\nThe first of these countries to which we naturally turn is Burmah, which\r\nadopted the religion of Sakya Muni at a very early period, and borrowed\r\nalso many of the Indian forms of architecture, but with differences we\r\nare now at a loss to account for. It may be, that, as we know nothing\r\npractically of the architectural forms of the Lower Bengal provinces\r\nbefore the beginning of the 6th century, these forms may have been taken\r\nto Prome and Pegu before that time; or it may be that a northern or\r\nThibetan element crept into Burmah across the northern mountains by some\r\nroute we cannot now follow. These are interesting problems we shall not\r\nbe able to solve till we have a more critical knowledge than we now\r\npossess of Burmese buildings. Thanks to the zeal and intelligence of\r\nsome recent English travellers, we do know a great deal about Burmese\r\nart. The works of Symes,[564] Crawfurd,[565] and, above all, of Colonel\r\nYule,[566] are replete with information; but what they did was done in\r\nthe intervals they were able to snatch from pressing public duties. What\r\nis really wanted is, that some qualified person should take up the\r\nsubject specially, and travel through the country with no other object\r\nthan to investigate its antiquities. With the knowledge we now have, six\r\nmonths spent on such a mission ought to tell us all, or nearly all, we\r\nnow want to know.[567] Pending that being done, we must be content to\r\nleave a good deal still to be explained by future investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHATÚN.\r\n\r\nThe earliest really authentic notice we have of these countries is in\r\nthe ‘Mahawanso.’ It is there related that, after the third\r\nconvocation--B.C. 246--Asoka despatched two missionaries, Sono and\r\nUttaro, to Souverna Bhumi, the Golden Land, to carry the glad tidings of\r\nthe religion of the Vanquisher.[568] It is now perfectly ascertained\r\nthat this place was almost certainly the Golden Chersonese of classical\r\ngeographers, situated on the Sitang river, and now called Thatún, about\r\nforty miles’ travelling distance north from Martaban.[569] Since it\r\nceased to be a place of importance, either by the silting up from the\r\nriver or the elevation of the land, it is now no longer a port; but\r\nthere can be little doubt that for some centuries before and after the\r\nChristian Era it was the emporium through which a very considerable\r\nportion of the trade between China and the western world was carried on.\r\nThe line of passage was apparently across the Bay of Bengal from the\r\ndelta of the Kistnah and Godavery; and it was to this trade route that\r\nwe probably owe the rise and importance of Amravati till it was\r\nsuperseded by the direct sea-voyage from Gujerat and the west coast of\r\nIndia in the 6th century. The place was sacked and entirely destroyed,\r\naccording to Sir A. Phayre, in A.D. 1080, by Anauratha, king of Pegu;\r\nbut long before that time it had been dwindling, from the growing\r\nimportance of Pegu, which was founded in A.D. 517 or A.D. 573.[570]\r\n\r\nThe only description of its ruins is by St. Andrew St. John, in the\r\nsecond volume of the ‘Phœnix’ above referred to; but they seem even now\r\nto be very extensive, in spite of neglect and consequent decay. The\r\nwalls can still be traced for 7700 ft. in one direction by 4000 ft. in\r\nanother, enclosing a regular oblong of more than 700 acres. In this\r\nenclosure are several old pagodas, some, unfortunately, recently\r\nrepaired, but all of a form we have not yet met with, though we shall\r\npresently when we come to speak of Java.\r\n\r\nThe principal pagoda here, like all the others, is built of hewn\r\nlaterite. Its base is a square, measuring 104 ft. each way, and 18 ft.\r\nhigh; the second storey is 70 ft. square and 16½ ft. high; the third\r\n48 ft. square and 12 ft. high. On this now stands a circular pagoda,\r\nmaking up the whole height to 85 ft. Mr. St. John fancies this circular\r\npart may be much more modern than the rest, but he adds, “the whole face\r\nof the pagoda has been carved in patterns; but the most remarkable part\r\nis the second storey, to which access is given by four flights of steps,\r\none in the centre of each face. The whole was apparently adorned with\r\nsculptures of the most elaborate character.”\r\n\r\nThere seem to be no data to enable us to fix with certainty the date of\r\nthis or of other similar pagodas in this place, and no photographs to\r\nenable us to speak with certainty as to their details, which is to be\r\nregretted, as it is just in such an old city as this that we may expect\r\nto find those early forms which may explain so much that is now\r\nunintelligible in subsequent examples. Thatún was coeval with\r\nAnuradhapura in Ceylon, and if examined with care, might do as much for\r\nthe square form of temple as the island capital may do for the round\r\nform. Their greatest interest would, however, arise from the light they\r\nmight throw on the square temples of Pagan and other Burmese cities,\r\nwhose origin it has hitherto been impossible to explain. Meanwhile it is\r\na fact worth bearing in mind that we find here square three-storeyed\r\npagodas, which certainly were erected before A.D. 1080, when the city\r\nwas destroyed, and probably before the 6th century, when it was\r\npractically superseded by the rise of the new city and kingdom of Pegu.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROME.\r\n\r\nIf we might trust the Burmese annals, Prome was a capital city as early\r\nas the year 101 of Faith, or after the Nirvana of Buddha.[571] In other\r\nwords, it seems probable that Buddhist missionaries from the second\r\nconvocation held under Kalasoka, in the previous year (B.C. 433),\r\nestablished themselves here, and introduced the new religion into the\r\ncountry.[572] The real political capital of the country at that time\r\nseems to have been Tagoung, half-way between Ava and Bhamo, on the Upper\r\nIrawaddi.[573] Prome, however, seems to have continued the religious\r\ncapital till A.D. 107, when the two capitals were amalgamated, under the\r\nname of Old Pagan on the northern site, to be again transferred to New\r\nPagan, below Ava, about the year 847.[574] Upper Pagan seems to have\r\nbeen visited by Captain Hannay, in A.D. 1835, and by others\r\nsubsequently, and the remains are described as extensive, but too much\r\nruined and obscured by jungle to admit of any scientific investigation.\r\nThose of Prome would probably be even more interesting; but I know of no\r\ndescription that enables us to ascertain what they really are. I have\r\nphotographs of some dagobas--rather too tall to be very old--but,\r\nwithout some mouldings or architectural details, it is impossible to\r\nguess even what their age may be; so that practically the architectural\r\nhistory of Burmah begins with the foundation of Pagan in the middle of\r\nthe 9th century, and as it was destroyed by the Chinese, or rather the\r\nTartar army of Kublai Khan, in 1284,[575] its glory lasted little more\r\nthan four centuries. During that period, however, it was adorned by a\r\nvery extensive series of monuments, most of which still remain in a\r\nstate of very tolerable preservation.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be observed that the rise and fall of Pagan are, as nearly\r\nas may be, coincident with that of Pollonarua, in Ceylon; but the\r\nBurmese city seems to have excelled the Ceylonese capital both in the\r\nextent of its buildings and in their magnificence. Their differences,\r\ntoo, both in form and detail, are very remarkable, but, if properly\r\ninvestigated, would throw light on many religious and ethnographical\r\nproblems that are now very obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGAN.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Pagan extend about eight miles in length along the river,\r\nwith an average breadth of about two miles, and within that space\r\nColonel Yule estimates there may still be traced the remains of 800 or\r\n1000 temples. Several of these are of great magnificence, and are kept\r\nin a state of repair; but the bulk of them are in ruins, and the forms\r\nof the greater part hardly distinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 346. Plan of Ananda Temple. (From Yule.) Scale 100 ft. to\r\n1 in.]\r\n\r\nOf these, one of the most remarkable is that of Ananda. As will be seen\r\nfrom the annexed plan (Woodcut No. 346), it is a square of nearly 200\r\nft. on each side, with projecting porticos on each face, so that it\r\nmeasures 280 ft. across each way. Like all the great pagodas of the\r\ncity, it is seven storeys in height; six of these are square and flat,\r\neach diminishing in extent, so as to give the whole a pyramidal form;\r\nthe seventh, which is or simulates the cell of the temple, takes the\r\nform of a Hindu or Jaina temple, the whole in this instance rising to\r\nthe height of 183 ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 347. Plan of Thapinya. (From Yule.) Scale 100 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nInternally, the building is extremely solid, being intersected only by\r\ntwo narrow concentric corridors; but in rear of each projecting transept\r\nis a niche most artificially lighted from above, in which stands a\r\nstatue of Buddha more than 30 ft. in height. This is the arrangement we\r\nfind in the Chaumuk temple at Palitana and at Sadri (Woodcut No. 133),\r\nboth Jaina temples of the 15th century, and which it is consequently\r\nrather surprising to find here as early as the 11th century (A.D.\r\n1066[576]); but the form and the whole of the arrangement of these\r\ntemples are so unlike what we find elsewhere that we must be prepared\r\nfor any amount of anomalies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 348. Section of Thapinya. (From Yule.) Scale 50 ft. to 1\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nNext in rank to this is the Thapinya--the Omniscient--erected about the\r\nyear 1100 by the grandson of the king who built the Ananda. It is very\r\nsimilar to the Ananda both in dimensions and in plan, except that it has\r\nonly one porch instead of four, and consequently only one great statue\r\nin its cell instead of four standing back to back. Its height is 201\r\nft., and it is the highest in the place (Woodcuts Nos. 347, 348).\r\n\r\nThe third in importance is called the Gaudapalen, built in 1160. This\r\ntemple is smaller than those just mentioned, but makes up in richness\r\nand beauty of detail for its more diminutive dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe Dhamayangyee, now in ruins, is quite equal in dimensions to the\r\nAnanda, and very much resembles it in plan and design; while one called\r\nthe Sem Byo Koo, is, in its details, the most beautiful of any.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 349. View of the Temple of Gaudapalen. (From Yule.)]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of these temples will be understood from the\r\nannexed view (Woodcut No. 349) of that called Gaudapalen, and their\r\ngeneral arrangements from the section of the Thapinya, of which a plan\r\nis given (Woodcut No. 347). They are all so similar that it is needless\r\nto multiply illustrations, the only real difference being in the greater\r\nor less amount of ornament in stucco which has been applied to each.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes the inquirer on examining these temples is\r\ntheir remarkable dissimilarity with anything on the continent of India.\r\nThey are not topes in any sense of the term, nor are they viharas. The\r\none building we have hitherto met with which they in any way resemble is\r\nthe seven-storeyed Prasada at Pollonarua (Woodcut No. 106), which, no\r\ndoubt, belongs to the same class. It is possible that the square\r\npagodas at Thatún, when properly examined, may contain the explanation\r\nwe are searching for. They evidently were not alone, and many other\r\nexamples may still be found when looked for. On the whole, however, I am\r\ninclined to believe, improbable as it may at first sight appear, that\r\ntheir real synonyms are to be found in Babylonia, not in India. The Birs\r\nNimroud is, like them, a seven-storeyed temple, with external stairs,\r\nleading to a crowning cell or sanctuary. Of course, during the seventeen\r\ncenturies which elapsed between the erection of the two buildings,\r\nconsiderable changes have taken place. The lowest stairs in Burmah have\r\nbecome internal; in Babylonia they were apparently external. At the head\r\nof the third flight at the Birs, Sir Henry Rawlinson found the remains\r\nof three recesses. At Pagan these had been pushed into the centre of the\r\nthird storey. The external flights were continued on the upper three\r\nstoreys at both places; but in Babylonia they lead to what seems to have\r\nbeen the real sanctuary, in Burmah to a simulated one only, but of a\r\nform which, in India, always contained a cell and an image of the deity\r\nto whom the temple was dedicated.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, How is it possible that a Babylonian form should reach\r\nBurmah without leaving traces of its passage through India? It is hardly\r\na sufficient answer to say it must have come _viâ_ Thibet and Central\r\nAsia; because, in the present state of our knowledge, we do not know of\r\nsuch a route being used. It is a more probable explanation to say that\r\nsuch monuments may have existed in the great Gangetic cities, but, like\r\nthese Burmese examples, in brick and plaster; and have perished, as they\r\nwould be sure to do in that climate, and where hostile races succeeded\r\nthe Buddhists. But, however it may be eventually accounted for, it\r\nhardly appears to me doubtful that these Burmese seven-storeyed temples\r\nare the lineal descendants of the Babylonian examples, and that we shall\r\nsome day be able to supply the gaps which exist in their genealogy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one thing must be borne in mind. The earliest capital of the\r\nBurmese was Tagoung in the north, and their real affinities are with the\r\nnorth. They got their religion by the southern route from Bengal, but it\r\nwas engrafted on a stem of which we know very little, and all whose\r\naffinities have yet got to be traced to their source.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these square temples, it may be well to point out some\r\npeculiarities which are new to us. In the first place it is a purely\r\nbrick style, and, as such, using true radiating arches, not only to span\r\nthe openings but to roof their passages and halls. This is so unlike\r\nwhat we find in any part of India Proper, that it seems to point with\r\ncertainty to some foreign--most probably a northern--country for its\r\norigin. As frequently mentioned above, no Buddhist arch is known to\r\nexist in India,[577] and, except in the reign of Akbar, hardly a Hindu\r\none, in any temple down to the present day. It could hardly, in\r\nconsequence, be derived from that country, but there is no reason for\r\nbelieving that the Chinese or Tartar nations ever showed any aversion to\r\nthese forms. We know, at all events, that the Assyrians and Babylonians\r\nused brick arches long before the Christian Era, and the art may have\r\nbeen communicated by them to the nations of Northern Asia, and from them\r\nit may have come down the Irawaddi.\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious speculation to try and find out what the Jains in\r\nwestern India would have done had they been forced to use brick instead\r\nof stone during the 11th and 12th centuries, which was the great\r\nbuilding epoch on the Irawaddi and in Gujerat. Possibly they would have\r\narrived at the same conclusion, in which case we can only congratulate\r\nourselves that the westerns were not tempted with the fatal facility of\r\nbricks and mortar.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity is, that these square Burmese pagodas adopt the\r\ncurvilinear sikra of the Indo-Aryan style. This may be considered a\r\nsufficient indication that they derived some, at least, of their\r\narchitectural features, as well as their religion, from India; but as\r\nthis form was adopted by both Jains and Hindus in the north of India,\r\nfrom the mouths of the Indus to the Bay of Bengal in that age, it hardly\r\nenables us to point out the particular locality from which it was\r\nderived, or the time at which it was first introduced. It is, however,\r\nso far as we at present know, the only instance of its being found out\r\nof India Proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR DAGOBAS.\r\n\r\nLeaving these square quasi-Jaina temples, which are clearly exceptional,\r\nthe dagobas of Burmah are found to be generally much more like those\r\nwhich are found in India and Ceylon, though many, having been erected\r\nonly in the present century, are of forms more complex and attenuated\r\nthan those in India Proper.\r\n\r\nThe one most like the Indian type is that known as the Kong Madú, not\r\nfar from Mengûn, on the same side of the river. The mass of the dome,\r\naccording to Colonel Yule,[578] is about 100 ft. diameter. It is taller\r\nthan a semicircle--which would indicate a modern date--and stands on\r\nthree concentric bases, each wider than the other. Round the whole is a\r\nrailing, consisting of 784 stone pillars, each standing about 6 ft. out\r\nof the ground, and divided into four quadrants by four stone gateways\r\n(Woodcut No. 350). An inscription, on a white marble slab, records the\r\nerection of this pagoda between the years 1636 and 1650. I, at one time,\r\nthought it must be older; but the evidence of recent explorations\r\nrenders this date more probable than it formerly appeared. If correct,\r\nit is curious as showing how little real change had occurred during the\r\nsixteen centuries which elapsed between the erection of the tope at\r\nSanchi (Woodcuts Nos. 10-12) and the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 350. Kong Madú Dagoba. (From Yule.)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important pagoda in the Burmese empire is the great\r\nShoëmadu[579] at Pegu, of which a plan and elevation are given from\r\nthose published by Colonel Symes in his account of his embassy to Ava.\r\nAs will be seen from the woodcuts (Nos. 351, 352), the plan deviates\r\nconsiderably from the circular form, which is exclusively used in the\r\nedifices of this class hitherto described, and approaches more nearly to\r\nthose elaborately polygonal forms which are affected by all the Hindu\r\nbuilders of modern date. It returns, however, to the circular form\r\nbefore terminating, and is crowned, like all Burmese buildings of this\r\nclass, by an iron spire or tee richly gilt.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity is strongly indicative of its modern date: namely,\r\nthat instead of a double or triple range of pillars surrounding its\r\nbase, we have a double range of minute pagodas--a mode of ornamentation\r\nthat subsequently became typical in Hindu architecture--their temples\r\nand spires being covered, and, indeed, composed of innumerable models of\r\nthemselves, clustered together so as to make up a whole. As before\r\nremarked, something of the same sort occurs in Roman art, where every\r\nwindow and opening is surmounted by a pediment or miniature temple end,\r\nand in Gothic art, where a great spire is surrounded by pinnacles or\r\nspirelets; but in these styles it is never carried to the same excess as\r\nin Hindu art. In the present instance it is interesting, as being one of\r\nthe earliest attempts at this class of decoration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 351. Shoëmadu Pagoda, Pegu. (From Col. Symes’ ‘Embassy to\r\nAva.’)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 352. Half-plan of Shoëmadu Pagoda. (From Symes.) Scale\r\n100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nThe building stands on two terraces, the lower one about 10 ft. high,\r\nand 1391 ft. square; the upper one, 20 ft. in height, and 684 ft.\r\nsquare; from the centre rises the pagoda, the diameter of whose base is\r\n395 ft. The small pagodas are 27 ft. high, and 108 or 110 in number;\r\nwhile the great pagoda itself rises to the height of 331 ft. above its\r\nterrace, or 361 ft. above the country, thus reaching a height about\r\nequal to that of St. Paul’s Cathedral: while the side of the upper\r\nterrace is only 83 ft. less than that of the great Pyramid.\r\n\r\nTradition ascribes its commencement to two merchants, who raised it to\r\nthe height of 12 cubits, at an age slightly subsequent to that of Buddha\r\nhimself. Successive kings of Pegu added to it from time to time, till at\r\nlast it assumed its present form, most probably about three or four\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\nThe next in importance, so far as we know, is the more generally known\r\nShoëdagong pagoda at Rangûn, a building very similar in dimensions to\r\nthe last named, and by no means unlike it, except that the outline of\r\nthe base is cut up to even a greater extent, and the spire more\r\nattenuated--both signs of a comparatively modern date. The base is even\r\nmore crowded by little temples than that at Pegu, and its whole height\r\nis somewhat less. There is, however, no essential difference between the\r\ntwo buildings, and this is principally interesting as leading us one\r\nstep further in the series from the solid hemispherical mound to the\r\nthin spire, which, both in Burmah and Siam, is the modern form usually\r\nassumed by these edifices, till they lose all but a traditional\r\nresemblance to the buildings from which they originally sprang.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of their spires may be gathered from the three\r\nshown on the left of the annexed woodcut (No. 353), which is precisely\r\nthat of the Great Pagoda. This illustration is also valuable as showing\r\nthe last lineal descendant of these great human-headed winged lions that\r\nonce adorned the portals of the palaces at Nineveh; but after nearly\r\n3000 years of wandering and ill-treatment have degenerated into these\r\nwretched caricatures of their former selves.\r\n\r\nThe Shoëdagong pagoda, like all the more important ones, is fabled to\r\nhave been commenced about 2300 years ago, or about the era of Buddha\r\nhimself; its sanctity, however, is owing to its containing relics, not\r\nonly of the last Buddha, but also of his three predecessors--Buddha\r\nhaving vouchsafed eight hairs of his head to its two founders, on the\r\nunderstanding that they were to be enshrined with the relics of the\r\nthree former Buddhas, where and when found.[580] After numerous\r\nmiraculous indications, on this spot were discovered the staff of\r\nKakusanda, believed to have lived some 3000 years before Christ, the\r\nwater-dipper of Konagamma, and the bathing garment of Kasyapa, which,\r\nwith the eight hairs above mentioned, are enshrined within this great\r\npagoda.[581] Originally, however, notwithstanding the value of its\r\ndeposit, the building was small, and it is probably not more than a\r\ncentury since it assumed its present form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 353. View of Pagoda in Rangûn. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nA crowd of smaller pagodas surrounds the larger one, of all sizes, from\r\n30 ft. to 200 ft. in height, and even more. There is scarcely a village\r\nin the country that does not possess one or two, and in all the more\r\nimportant towns they are numbered by hundreds; indeed, they may almost\r\nbe said to be innumerable. They are almost all quite modern, and so much\r\nalike as not to merit any distinct or separate mention. They indicate,\r\nhowever, a great degree of progressive wealth and power in the nation,\r\nfrom the earliest times to the present day, and an increasing prevalence\r\nof the Buddhistical system. This is a direct contrast to the history of\r\nCeylon, whose glory was greatest in the earliest centuries of the\r\nChristian Era, and was losing its purity at the time when the\r\narchitectural history of Burmah first dawns upon us. Thus the buildings\r\nof one country supplement those of the other, and present together a\r\nseries of examples of the same class, ranging over more than 2000 years,\r\nif we reckon from the oldest topes in Ceylon to the most modern in\r\nBurmah.\r\n\r\nAt a place called Mengûn, about half-way between the former capital of\r\nAmîrapura and the present one at Mandalé, are two pagodas, which are not\r\nwithout considerable interest for our present purposes; if for no other\r\nreason, at least for this--that both were erected within the limits of\r\nthe present century, and show that neither the forms nor aspirations of\r\nthe art were wholly extinguished even in our day. The first is circular\r\nin form, and was erected in the year 1816, in the reign of a king of\r\nBurmah called Bodo Piyah, who is also the author of the second. As will\r\nbe seen from the woodcut (No. 354), it is practically a dagoba, with\r\nfive concentric procession-paths. Each of these is ornamented by a\r\ncurious serpent-like balustrade, interspersed with niches containing, or\r\nintended to contain, statues of Buddha, and is accessible by four\r\nflights of steps facing the four cardinal points. The whole is\r\nsurrounded by a low circular wall, 750 ft. in diameter, said to\r\nrepresent the serpent Ananta. Within this is a basement, measuring about\r\n400 ft. across, and this, with the procession-paths and dagoba on the\r\nsummit, make up seven storeys, intended, it is said, to symbolise the\r\nmythical Mount Meru.[582]\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that, when speaking of the great dagobas of\r\nAnuradhapura in Ceylon, it was pointed out (_ante_, p. 190) that they\r\nhad three procession-paths round their bases, ascended in like manner by\r\nflights of steps opposite the four cardinal points of the compass. It is\r\ninteresting to observe here, after a lapse of 2000 years, and at a\r\ndistance of nearly 1500 miles, the changes have been so small. It is\r\ntrue the number of procession-paths has increased from three to five,\r\nand the terraces become relatively much more important than in the older\r\nexamples; but, barring this and some changes in detail, the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 354. Circular Pagoda at Mengûn. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nmonuments are practically the same, notwithstanding all the curious\r\nvarieties that have sprung up in the interval.\r\n\r\nThe other pagoda at this place was commenced by the same king, called\r\nMentara Gyé, or Bodo Piyah, who died in 1819, and seems to have been an\r\nattempt to revive the old square forms of Pagan, in the same manner as\r\nthe other was intended to recall memories of the older forms of early\r\nIndian Buddhism. “It stands on a basement of five successive terraces,\r\nof little height, the lower terrace forming a square of 450 ft. From the\r\nupper terrace starts the vast cubical pile of the pagoda, 230 ft. square\r\nin plan, and rising, in a solid mass, to the height of about 100 ft.,\r\nwith slightly sloping walls. Above this it contracts in successive\r\nterraces, three of which had been completed, raising the mass to a\r\nheight of 165 ft., at the time the work was abandoned.”[583] From a\r\nmodel standing near, it is inferred that, if completed, it would have\r\nrisen to the height of 500 ft.; it is even now a solid mass containing\r\nbetween 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 cubic feet of brickwork. Had it been\r\ncarried out, it would have been the tallest building in the world. It\r\nwas, however, shattered by an earthquake in 1839; but, even in its\r\nruined state, is as large and imposing a mass of brickwork as is to be\r\nfound anywhere.[584] Since the pyramids of Egypt, nothing so great has\r\nbeen attempted, and it belongs to the 19th century!\r\n\r\n\r\nMONASTERIES.\r\n\r\nAs Burmah is a country in which the monastic system of Buddhism\r\nflourishes at the present day to the fullest extent, if we had more\r\ninformation regarding its monasteries, or _kioums_ as they are called,\r\nit might enable us to understand the arrangement of the older ones. The\r\ntravellers who have visited the country have been silent on the subject,\r\nprincipally because the monasteries are, in almost all instances, less\r\nmagnificent than the pagodas to which they are attached, and are, with\r\nscarcely an exception, built of wood--a practice destructive of their\r\narchitectural character, and also depriving them wholly of that\r\nmonumental appearance of stability which is so essential to true\r\narchitectural expression.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity is not confined to the monasteries; all residences,\r\nfrom that of the poorest peasant to the palace of the king, having been\r\nconstructed from time immemorial of this perishable material. The custom\r\nhas now passed into a law, that no one shall have the power of erecting\r\nbuildings of stone or brick, except it be the king himself, or unless\r\nthe edifices be of a purely religious character. Even this exception is\r\nnot always taken advantage of, for the king’s palace itself is as\r\nessentially a wooden erection as the dwelling of any of his subjects. It\r\nis, however, not the less magnificent on this account--rather, perhaps,\r\nmore so--immense sums being spent on the most elaborate carvings, and\r\nthe whole being lacquered, painted, and gilt, to an extent of which we\r\nhave no conception in our more sober clime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 355. Façade of the King’s Palace, Burmah. (From a Sketch\r\nby Col. Yule.)]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the façade may be realised from the annexed\r\nview (Woodcut No. 355); but its real magnificence consists in the\r\nprofusion of gilding and carving with which every part is covered, and\r\nto which it is impossible to do justice on so small a scale.\r\n\r\nThe same profuse decorations are bestowed upon the monasteries, one of\r\nwhich is represented in the annexed woodcut (No. 356), showing a\r\nbuilding in which all the defects arising from the use of so easily\r\ncarved a material, are carried to excess. If the colouring and gilding\r\ncould be added, it would represent a building such as the West never\r\nsaw, and, let us hope, never will see; for, however dazzling its\r\nsplendour, such barbaric magnificence is worthy only of a half-civilized\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 356. Burmese Kioum. (From Col. Symes’ ‘Embassy to Ava.’)]\r\n\r\nThe naked form of these monasteries--if the expression may be used--will\r\nbe understood from the following woodcut (No. 357) of one recently\r\nerected at Mandalé, and, though inhabited, not quite finished. It is\r\nfive storeys in height, and, if I mistake not, as nearly reproduces the\r\nLowa Maha Paya of Anuradhapura, as the circular Mengûn pagoda does the\r\nAbhayagiri or Ruanwelli dagobas there. Here, however, the storeys have\r\nlost their meaning; only one storey is used as a residence[585]--the\r\nfirst, or “piano nobile,” as we would call it. The upper storeys are\r\nonly ornamental reminiscences of past utilitarian forms, but which\r\nevidently once had a meaning. Had the building been completed--perhaps\r\nit is now--it would have been ornamented with carving as richly as that\r\nrepresented in the preceding woodcut, for it is one of the advantages\r\nof wooden architecture, that its decorative features may be added after\r\nthe fabric is practically complete in all essential points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 357. Monastery at Mandalé. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThese many-storeyed kioums, with the tall seven-storeyed spires (shown\r\nin Woodcuts Nos. 353 and 356), bring us back to the many-storeyed\r\ntemples in Nepal, which are in all essential respects so nearly\r\nidentical, that it can hardly be doubted they had a common origin. We\r\nare not yet in a position to point out the connecting links which will\r\nfuse the detached fragments of this style into a homogeneous whole, but\r\nit is probably in China that they must be looked for, only we know so\r\nlittle of the architectural history of the western portion of that great\r\ncountry, that we must wait for further information before even venturing\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nThe fact that all the buildings of Burmah are of wood, except the\r\npagodas, may also explain how it is that India possesses no\r\narchitectural remains anterior to the age of Asoka. Except the\r\ncomparatively few masonry pagodas, none of which existed prior to his\r\nera, there is nothing in Burmah that a conflagration of a few hours\r\nwould not destroy, or the desertion of a few years entirely obliterate.\r\nThat the same was the practice of India is almost certain, from the\r\nessentially wooden forms still found prevailing in all the earlier cave\r\ntemples; and, if so, this fully accounts for the disappearance of all\r\nearlier monuments.\r\n\r\nWe know that wooden architecture was the characteristic of Nineveh,\r\nwhere all the constructive parts were formed in this perishable\r\nmaterial; and from the Bible we learn that Solomon’s edifices were\r\nchiefly so constructed. Persepolis presents us with the earliest\r\ninstance in Asia of this wooden architecture being petrified, as it\r\nwere--apparently in consequence of the intercourse its builders\r\nmaintained with Egypt and with Greece.\r\n\r\nIn Burmah these wooden types still exist in more completeness than,\r\nperhaps, in any other country. Even if the student is not prepared to\r\nadmit the direct ethnographic connexion between the buildings of Burmah\r\nand Babylon--which seems hardly to admit of doubt--he will at any rate\r\nbest learn in this country to appreciate much in ancient architecture,\r\nwhich, without such a living illustration, it is hard to understand.\r\nSolomon’s House of the Cedars of Lebanon is, with mere difference of\r\ndetail, reproduced at Ava or Amîrapura; and the palaces of Nineveh and\r\nPersepolis are rendered infinitely more intelligible by the study of\r\nthese edifices. Burmah is almost equally important in enabling us to\r\nunderstand what an active, prosperous Buddhist community may have been\r\nin India at a time when that religion flourished there; and altogether,\r\nif means were available for its full elucidation, it would form one of\r\nthe most interesting chapters in the History of Architecture in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSIAM.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nPagodas at Ayuthia and Bangkok--Hall of Audience at Bangkok--General\r\nRemarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the architecture of Siam is very much less important than that\r\nof Burmah on the one hand, or Cambodia on the other, it is still\r\nsufficiently so to prevent its being passed over in a general summary of\r\nstyles. Its worst feature, as we now know it, is, that it is so\r\nextremely modern. Up to the 14th century the capital of the country was\r\nSokotay, a city on the Menam, 200 miles from the sea in a direct line,\r\nand situated close to the hills. This city has not been visited by any\r\ntraveller in modern times, so we do not know what buildings it may\r\ncontain. About the year 1350 the Siamese were successful in their wars\r\nwith the Cambodians, and eventually succeeded in capturing their\r\ncapital, Intha patha puri, or Indra prestha (Delhi), and practically\r\nannexing Cambodia to their kingdom.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished this, they moved their capital down to Ayuthia, a\r\nlittle more than fifty miles from the sea; and three centuries\r\nafterwards Bangkok succeeded it, and is now the capital. It is by no\r\nmeans certain whether this migration downwards was caused by political\r\nevents and increasing commerce, or from the country gradually becoming\r\ndrier and more fit for human habitation. Judging from what happened in\r\nBengal in historical times, I should fancy it was the latter.\r\n\r\nIn India we find civilized nations first established in the Punjab and\r\non the watershed between the Sutlej and the Jumna. Between 2000 and 3000\r\nyears B.C. Oude seems to have become dry enough for human habitation,\r\nand Ayodhya[586] (from which the Siamese capital took its name) became\r\nthe chief city. Between 1000 and 500 B.C. Janakpore on the north, and\r\nRajagriha on the south, were the capital cities of Bengal; but both\r\nbeing situated on the hills, it was not till Asoka’s time (250 B.C.)\r\nthat Patna on the Soane and Vaisali on the Gunduck, became capitals; and\r\nstill another 1000 years elapsed before Gaur and Dacca became important,\r\nwhile Moorshedabad, Hooghly, and Calcutta, are cities of\r\nyesterday.[587] The same phenomenon seems to have occurred in Siam, and,\r\nwhat is of still more interest, as we shall presently see, in Cambodia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 358. Ruins of a Pagoda at Ayuthia.]\r\n\r\nAs Ayuthia was for three centuries the flourishing capital of one of the\r\ngreat building races of the world, we should, of course, look for\r\nconsiderable magnificence having been displayed in its architecture.\r\nFrom the accounts of the early Portuguese and Dutch travellers who\r\nvisited it in the days of its glory, it seems to have merited the title\r\nthey bestowed upon it of the “Venice of the East,” and the remains\r\njustify their eulogiums. The buildings, however, seem to have been\r\nprincipally constructed of brick and wood; and as the city has now been\r\npractically deserted for more than a century, the wild fig-trees have\r\neverywhere inserted their roots into the masonry, and decay has\r\nprogressed rapidly among the wooden erections. As described by recent\r\nvisitors, nothing can be more wildly picturesque than this once splendid\r\ncity, now overgrown with jungle; but such a stage of decay is, of all\r\nconditions, the least favourable to the researches of the antiquary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe form which the older pagodas took at Ayuthia differs in many\r\nessential respects from those which we find either in India or in\r\nBurmah. The top or upper part has a rounded domical shape, which we can\r\neasily fancy to be derived from the tope, but the upright part looks\r\nmore like the sikra of a Hindu temple than anything Buddhist. If we had\r\na few earlier examples, perhaps we might trace the steps by which the\r\none passed into the other; at present the gaps in the series are too\r\ngreat to be bridged over with anything approaching certainty. One link,\r\nhowever, seems to be supplied by the temples of Nakhon Wat in Cambodia,\r\nof which more hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 359. Ruins of a Pagoda at Ayuthia. (From Mouhot.)]\r\n\r\nThe same outline is found in the crowning members of the pagodas of\r\nBangkok, but they are covered with an elaboration of detail and\r\nexuberance of coloured ornament that has seldom been surpassed, nor is\r\nit desirable it should be, for it is here carried to an extent truly\r\nbarbarous (Woodcut No. 360).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the bad taste which they display, these Bangkok pagodas\r\nare interesting in the history of architecture as exemplifying the\r\ninstinctive mode in which some races build, and the innate and\r\nirrepressible love of architecture they display. But it also shows how\r\neasily these higher aspirations degenerate into something very\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 360. The Great Tower of the Pagoda Wat-ching at Bangkok.\r\n(From Mouhot.)]\r\n\r\nlike vulgarity, when exercised by a people in so low a stage of\r\ncivilization as the modern Siamese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 361. Hall of Audience at Bangkok. (From Mouhot.)]\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to their civic buildings: palaces and porticos,\r\nand even dwelling-houses, are all as rich as carving and gilding, and\r\npainting, can make them; but, as in the pagodas, it is overdone, and\r\nfails to please, because it verges on vulgarity.\r\n\r\nThe typical design of all these halls and minor buildings will be\r\nunderstood from the preceding woodcut, representing the Hall of Audience\r\nat Bangkok. Like all the others, it has two roofs intersecting one\r\nanother at right angles, and a spire of greater or less elevation on the\r\nintersection. Sometimes one, two, or three smaller gables are placed in\r\nfront of the first, each lower than the one behind it, so as to give a\r\npyramidal effect to the whole. Generally, the subordinate gables are of\r\nthe same width as those in the centre; but sometimes the outer one is\r\nsmaller, forming a porch. In the audience hall just quoted there are\r\nthree gables each way. These may be seen on the right and left of the\r\ncentral spire in the view, but the first and second towards the front\r\nare hidden by the outer gable. The point of sight being taken exactly in\r\nfront, it looks in the view as if there were only one in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe Burmese adopt the same arrangement in their civil buildings, and in\r\nSiam and Burmah the varieties are infinite, from the simple pavilion\r\nwith four gables, supported on four pillars,[588] to those with twelve\r\nand sixteen gables, combined with a greater complication of walls and\r\npillars for their support.\r\n\r\nAs the Siamese are certainly advancing in civilization, it may be asked,\r\nWill not their architecture be improved and purified by the process? The\r\nanswer is, unfortunately, too easy. The new civilization is not\r\nindigenous, but an importation. The men of progress wear hats, the\r\nladies crinolines, and they build palaces with Corinthian porticos and\r\nsash-windows. It is the sort of civilization that is found in the Bazar\r\nin Calcutta, and it is not desirable, in an architectural point of view,\r\nat all events, if, indeed, it is so in any other respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nJAVA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nHistory--Boro Buddor--Temples at Mendoet and Brambanam--Tree and Serpent\r\nTemples--Temples at Djeing and Suku.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no chapter in the whole history of Eastern art so full of\r\napparent anomalies, or which so completely upsets our preconceived ideas\r\nof things as they ought to be, as that which treats of the architectural\r\nhistory of the island of Java. In the Introduction, it was stated that\r\nthe leading phenomenon in the history of India was the continued influx\r\nof race after race across the Indus into her fertile plain, but that no\r\nreflex wave had ever returned to redress the balance.[589] This seems\r\nabsolutely true as regards the west, and practically so in reference to\r\nthe north, or the neighbouring countries on the east. Thibet and Burmah\r\nreceived their religion from India, not, however, either by conquest or\r\ncolonisation, but by missionaries sent to instruct and convert. This\r\nalso is true of Ceylon, and partially so at least of Cambodia. These\r\ncountries being all easily accessible by land, or a very short sea\r\npassage, it is there that we might look for migrations, if any ever took\r\nplace, but it is not so. The one country to which they overflowed was\r\nJava, and there they colonised to such an extent as for nearly 1000\r\nyears to obliterate the native arts and civilization, and supplant it by\r\ntheir own. What is still more singular is, that it was not from the\r\nnearest shores of India that these emigrants departed, but from the\r\nwestern coast. We have always been led to believe that the Indians hated\r\nthe sea, and dreaded long sea voyages, yet it seems almost certain that\r\nthe colonists of Java came not from the valley of the Ganges, but from\r\nthat of the Indus, and passed round Ceylon in thousands and tens of\r\nthousands on their way to their distant sea-girt home. The solution of\r\nthis difficulty may perhaps be found in the suggestion that the\r\ncolonists were not Indians after all, in the sense in which we usually\r\nunderstand the term, but nations from the north-west--the inhabitants in\r\nfact of Gandhara and Cambodia, who, finding no room for new settlements\r\nin India Proper, turning to their right, passed down the Indus, and\r\nsought a distant home on this Pearl of Islands.\r\n\r\nWhoever they were, they carried with them the bad habit of all their\r\ncognate races, of writing nothing, so that we have practically no\r\nauthentic written record of the settlement and of its subsequent\r\nhistory, and were it not that they made up for this deficiency to a\r\ngreat extent by their innate love of building, we should hardly know of\r\ntheir existence in the island. They did, however, build and carve, with\r\nan energy and to an extent nowhere surpassed in their native lands, and\r\nhave dignified their new home with imperishable records of their art and\r\ncivilization--records that will be easily read and understood, so soon\r\nas any one will take the trouble to devote to them the attention with\r\nwhich they deserve to be studied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and not without reason, that the English did more for\r\nthe elucidation of the arts and history of Java during the five years\r\nthey held the island (1811 to 1816) than the Dutch had done during the\r\nprevious two centuries they had practically been in possession. The work\r\nof the governor, Sir Stamford Raffles, is a model of zealous energy and\r\ncritical acumen, such as is rarely to be found of its class in the\r\nEnglish language, and is the storehouse from which the bulk of our\r\nknowledge of the subject must still be derived. His efforts in this\r\ndirection were well seconded by two Scotchmen, who took up the cause\r\nwith almost equal zeal. One of these, John Crawfurd, noted down\r\neverything he came across with patient industry, and accumulated vast\r\nstores of information--but he could not draw, and knew nothing of\r\narchitecture or the other arts, with which he had no sympathy. The\r\nother, Colin Mackenzie--afterwards Surveyor-General of India--drew\r\neverything he found of any architectural importance, and was the most\r\nindustrious and successful collector of drawings and manuscripts that\r\nIndia has ever known; but he could not write. The few essays he\r\nattempted are meagre in the extreme, and nine-tenths of his knowledge\r\nperished with him. Had these two men been able to work together to the\r\nend, they would have left little for future investigation. There was,\r\nhowever, still a fourth labourer in the field--Dr. John Leyden--who, had\r\nhis life been spared, could have easily assimilated the work of his\r\ncolleagues, and with his own marvellous genius for acquiring languages\r\nand knowledge of all sorts, would certainly have lifted the veil that\r\nnow shrouds so much of Javan history in darkness, and left very little\r\nto be desired in this respect. He died, however, almost before his work\r\nwas begun, and the time was too short, and the task too new, for the\r\nothers to do all that with more leisure and better preparation they\r\nmight have accomplished.\r\n\r\nDuring the last sixty years the Dutch have done a good deal to redeem\r\nthe neglect of the previous centuries, but, as has happened in the\r\nsister island of Ceylon, it has been without system, and no master mind\r\nhas arisen to give unity to the whole, or to extract from what is done\r\nthe essence, which is all the public care to possess. The Dutch\r\nGovernment have, however, published, in four great folio volumes, 400\r\nplates, from Mr. Wilsen’s drawings, of the architecture and sculptures\r\nof Boro Buddor; and the Batavian Society[590] have published sixty-five\r\nphotographic plates of the same monument; and as Dr. Leemans of Leyden\r\nhas added a volume of text, historical and descriptive, there is no\r\nmonument in the East so fully and so well illustrated as this one, and\r\nprobably none that better deserves the pains that have been bestowed\r\nupon it.[591] The same Society have also published 332 photographs of\r\nother Javan antiquities and temples, but, unfortunately, for the most\r\npart without any accompanying text. A thoroughly well qualified\r\nantiquary, Heer Brumund, was employed to visit the localities, and write\r\ndescriptions, but unfortunately he died before his task was half\r\ncomplete. A fragment of his work is published in the 33rd volume of the\r\n‘Transactions’ of the Society, but it is only a fragment, and just\r\nsufficient to make us long for more. At the same time an Oriental\r\nscholar, Dr. Friederich, was employed by Government to translate the\r\nnumerous inscriptions that abound in the island, and which, without\r\ndoubt, would explain away all the difficulties in the history of the\r\nisland and its monuments. Some of these were published in the 26th\r\nvolume of the ‘Verhandelingen’ in 1856, and more were promised, but\r\nill-health and accidents have hitherto prevented this being done, and if\r\nhe should happen to die before publishing the results, the accumulations\r\nof half a century may perish with him.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it may be gathered that a considerable amount of\r\ninformation exists in English and Dutch publications regarding the\r\nantiquities of Java, but it is _rudis indigestaque moles_--descriptions\r\nwithout illustration, and drawings and photographs without description,\r\nvery few plans, and, except for Boro Buddor, very few architectural\r\ndetails; no statistical account, and no maps on which all the places can\r\nbe recognised. It is provoking to think when so much has been done, how\r\nlittle more is required to bring order out of chaos, and fuse the whole\r\ninto one of the most interesting and most easily intelligible chapters\r\nof architectural history.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\nAmidst the confusion of their annals, it is rather fortunate that the\r\nJavans make no claim to more remote political history than the fabled\r\narrival in the island of Adji Saka, the founder of the Saka era of the\r\nBuddhists, in A.D. 79. It is true that in the 8th or 9th century they\r\nobtained an abridged translation of the ‘Mahabharata,’ and, under the\r\ntitle of the ‘Brata Yudha,’ adopted it as a part of their own history,\r\nassigning sites on the island for all the principal scenes of that\r\ncelebrated struggle which took place in the neighbourhood of Delhi and\r\nHastinapura, adding only their own favourite Gendara Desa (Gandhara), to\r\nwhich they assigned a locality on the north of the island.[592] It is\r\nthus, unfortunately, that history is written in the East, and because it\r\nis so written, the Javans next thought it necessary to bring Salivahana,\r\nthe founder of the Saka era, to their island also. Having, as Buddhists,\r\nadopted his era, their childish vanity required his presence there, but\r\nas it is certain he never saw the island, his visit is fabled to have\r\nresulted in failure, and said to have left no traces of his presence.\r\n\r\nThe next person who appears on the scene is one of the most mysterious\r\nin Indian history. In the annals of Siam,[593] of Cambodia,[594] of\r\nJava,[595] and at Amravati,[596] a prince of Rom, or Rum, coming from\r\nTaxila, plays a most important part, but without apparently any very\r\npermanent result. Nowhere is his name given, nor any particulars; most\r\nprobably it is only a reminiscence of King Commerce. Nothing is more\r\nlikely than that the ships of the Roman or Byzantine emperors, with\r\ntheir disciplined crews, should have made an impression on the\r\nsemi-civilized communities of these remote lands, and the memory be\r\nperpetuated in fabled exploits to modern times.[597]\r\n\r\nLeaving these fabulous ages, we at last come to a tradition that seems\r\nto rest on a surer foundation. “In the year 525 (A.D. 603), it being\r\nforetold to a king of Kuj’rat, or Gujerat, that his country would decay\r\nand go to ruin, he resolved to send his son to Java. He embarked with\r\nabout 5000 followers in six large and about 100 small vessels, and after\r\na voyage of four months, reached an island they supposed to be Java; but\r\nfinding themselves mistaken, re-embarked, and finally settled at\r\nMatarem, in the centre of the island they were seeking.” “The prince\r\nnow found that men alone were wanting to make a great and flourishing\r\nstate; he accordingly applied to Gujerat for assistance, when his\r\nfather, delighted at his success, sent him a reinforcement of 2000\r\npeople.” “From this period,” adds the chronicle, “Java was known and\r\ncelebrated as a kingdom; an extensive commerce was carried on with\r\nGujerat and other countries, and the bay of Matarem was filled with\r\nadventurers from all parts.”\r\n\r\nDuring the sovereignty of this prince and his two immediate successors,\r\n“the country advanced in fame and prosperity. The city of Mendang\r\nKumulan, since called Brambanan, increased in size and splendour:\r\nartists, particularly in stone and metals, arrived from distant\r\ncountries, and temples, the ruins of which are still extant, were\r\nconstructed both at this place and at Boro Buddor, in Kedu, during this\r\nperiod by artists invited from India.”[598]\r\n\r\nAll this is fully confirmed by an inscription found at Menankabu, in\r\nSumatra, wherein a king, who styles himself Maha Raja Adiraja\r\nAdityadharma King of Prathama--the first or greatest Java--boasts of his\r\nconquests and prowess, and he proclaims himself a Buddhist, a worshipper\r\nof the five Dyani Buddhas, and records his having erected a great\r\nseven-storeyed vihara in honour of Buddha.[599] This inscription is\r\ndated fifty years later, or in A.D. 656, but its whole tone is so\r\ncompletely confirmatory of the traditions just quoted from Sir S.\r\nRaffles, that there seems little doubt the two refer to events occurring\r\nabout the same time.\r\n\r\nThe only other event of importance in these early times bearing on our\r\nsubject is Fa Hian’s visit to the island in A.D. 414, on his way from\r\nCeylon to China by sea. The more, however, I think of it, the more\r\nconvinced I am that Java the Less, or Sumatra, was really the island he\r\nvisited. It certainly was the Iabadius, or Yavadwipa, of Ptolemy, and\r\nthe Java the Less of the Arab geographers and of Marco Polo;[600] and\r\nall the circumstances of the voyage seem to point rather to this island\r\nthan to Java proper. His testimony is, however, valuable, as they seem\r\nto have been united under one emperor in A.D. 656, and may have been so\r\ntwo centuries earlier. “In this country,” he says, “Heretics and\r\nBrahmans flourish; but the Law of Buddha is not much known.”[601] As he\r\nresided there five months, and had been fourteen years in India, he knew\r\nperfectly what he was speaking about.\r\n\r\nThat there were Brahmans in these islands before the advent of the\r\nBuddhist emigrants in the 7th century seems more than probable from the\r\ntraditions about Tritrésta collected by Sir S. Raffles[602] and others;\r\nbut, if so, they were Aryan Brahmans, belonging to some of the\r\nnon-building races, who may have gone there as missionaries, seeking\r\nconverts, but hardly as colonists or conquerors. Indeed, all over the\r\nisland circles of stone are found, either wholly unfashioned or carved\r\ninto rude representations of Hindu deities--so rude that even Ganesa can\r\nhardly sometimes be recognised; and it frequently requires an almost\r\nHindu trustfulness to believe that these rude stones sometimes represent\r\neven Siva and Vishnu and other gods of the Hindu Pantheon.[603] It seems\r\nas if the early Brahmans tried to teach their native converts to fashion\r\ngods for themselves, but, having no artistic knowledge of their own to\r\ncommunicate, failed miserably in the attempt. The Buddhists, on the\r\ncontrary, were artists, and came in such numbers that they were able to\r\ndispense with native assistance, nearly if not altogether.\r\n\r\nThe next recorded event that seems to bear on our investigations is the\r\nmission of the children of Dewa Kusuma to Kling or India, in order that\r\nthey might be educated in the Brahmanical religion.[604] This event took\r\nplace in A.D. 924, and seems to point distinctly to a time when the\r\nBuddhist religion, as evidenced by the erection of Boro Buddor, had died\r\nout, and the quasi-Hindu temples of Brambanam and Singa Sari had\r\nsuperseded those of the Buddhists. Those at Brambanam are said to have\r\nbeen completed in A.D. 1097, which seems an extremely probable date for\r\nthe Chandi Sewa, or “1000 temples,” which, however, are much more Jaina\r\nthan Hindu. From that period till the beginning of the 15th century, the\r\nseries of monuments--many of them with dates upon them[605]--are\r\ntolerably complete, and there will be no difficulty in classifying them\r\nwhenever the task is fairly undertaken.\r\n\r\nAt this time we find the island divided into two kingdoms; one, having\r\nits capital at Pajajaram, about forty miles east of Batavia, occupied\r\nthe whole of the western or Sunda part of the island. The Sundas,\r\nhowever, were not a building race, and the portion occupied by them\r\nneed not be again referred to here. It contains no buildings except the\r\nrude Hindu remains above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe eastern portion of the island was occupied by the kingdom of\r\nMajapahit, founded, apparently, about the year 1300. It soon rose to a\r\nhigher pitch of power and splendour than any of the preceding kingdoms,\r\nand the capital was adorned with edifices of surpassing magnificence,\r\nbut mostly in brick, so that now they are little more than a mass of\r\nindistinguishable ruins. When, however, it had lasted little more than a\r\ncentury, Mahomedan missionaries appeared on the island, and\r\ngradually--not by conquest or the sword, but by persuasion--induced the\r\ninhabitants of the island to forsake the religion of their forefathers\r\nand adopt that of the Arabian Prophet. In the year 1479 the Mahomedans\r\nhad become so powerful that the city of Majapahit was taken by them by\r\nstorm, and the last Hindu dynasty of the island overthrown, and those\r\nthat remained of the foreign race driven to take refuge in the island of\r\nBali.[606]\r\n\r\nThen occurred what was, perhaps, the least-expected event in all “this\r\nstrange eventful history.” It is as if the masons had thrown away their\r\ntools, and the chisels had dropped from the hands of the carvers. From\r\nthat time forward no building was erected in Java, and no image carved,\r\nthat is worth even a passing notice. At a time when the Mahomedans were\r\nadorning India with monuments of surpassing magnificence no one in Java\r\nthought of building either a mosque, or a tomb, or a palace that would\r\nbe deemed respectable in any second-class state in any part of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFor nearly nine centuries (A.D. 603-1479) foreign colonists had\r\npersevered in adorning the island with edifices almost unrivalled\r\nelsewhere of their class; but at the end of that time, as happened so\r\noften in India, their blood had become diluted, their race impure, their\r\nenergy effete, and, as if at the touch of a magician’s wand, they\r\ndisappear. The inartistic native races resumed their sway, and art\r\nvanished from the land, never, probably, again to reappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORO BUDDOR.\r\n\r\nThere may be older monuments in the island of Java than Boro Buddor,\r\nbut, if so, they have not yet been brought to light. The rude stone\r\nmonuments of the western or Sunda end of the island may, of course, be\r\nolder, though I doubt it; but they are not architectural, and of real\r\nnative art we know nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir S. Raffles and J. Crawfurd wrote their works, no means existed\r\nof verifying dates by comparison of styles, and it is, therefore, little\r\nto be wondered at if the first gives A.D. 1360,[607] and the second A.D.\r\n1344,[608] as the date of this building. The former, however, was not\r\ndeceived by this date, inasmuch as at page 67 he says, “The edifices at\r\nSinga Sari were probably executed in the 8th or 9th century. They nearly\r\nresemble those of Brambanam and Boro Boddor. It is probable the whole\r\nwere constructed about the same period, or within the same century; at\r\nany rate, between the sixth and ninth century of the Christian Era.”\r\nThis, perhaps, errs a little the other way. Heer Brumund, on historical\r\ngrounds, places Boro Buddor “in the ninth, perhaps even in the eighth\r\ncentury of the Christian Era.”[609] On architectural grounds I would\r\nalmost unhesitatingly place it a century earlier. The style and\r\ncharacter of its sculptures are so nearly identical with those of the\r\nlatest caves at Ajunta (No. 26, for instance), and in the western Ghâts,\r\nthat they look as if they were executed by the same artists, and it is\r\ndifficult to conceive any great interval of time elapsing between the\r\nexecution of the two. If I am correct in placing the caves in the first\r\nhalf of the 7th century, we can hardly be far wrong in assigning the\r\ncommencement, at least, of the Javan monument to the second half of that\r\ncentury. This being so, I am very much inclined to believe that Boro\r\nBuddor may be the identical seven-storeyed vihara, mentioned by Aditya\r\nDharma in his inscription at Menankabu.[610] Its being found in Sumatra\r\ndoes not appear to me to militate against this view. Asoka’s\r\ninscriptions are found in Gandhara, Saurastra, and Orissa, but not in\r\nBehar. At home he was known: but it may be that he desired to place a\r\npermanent record of his greatness in the remote portions of his\r\ndominions. The date of the inscription, A.D. 656, accords so exactly\r\nwith the age I would assign to it from other sources, that it may at\r\nleast stand for the present. Of course, it was not completed at once, or\r\nin a few years. The whole group, with Chandi Pawon and Mendout, may\r\nprobably extend over a century and a half--down, say, to A.D. 800, or\r\nover the whole golden age of Buddhism in the island.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is fortunate for the student of Buddhist art in India that\r\nBoro Buddor (Woodcuts Nos. 362 and 363) has attracted so much attention;\r\nfor, even now, the five folio volumes of plates recently devoted to its\r\nillustration do not contain one figure too many for the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 362. Half-plan of Temple of Boro Buddor. (From a Plate in\r\nthe second edition of Sir Stamford Raffles’ ‘History of Java.’) Scale\r\n100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 363. Elevation and Section of Temple of Boro Buddor.\r\n(From an unpublished Plate intended for Sir Stamford Raffles’ ‘History\r\nof Java.’)]\r\n\r\npurpose of rendering its peculiarities available for scientific\r\npurposes: the fact being that this monument was erected just at the time\r\nwhen the Buddhist system attained its greatest development, and just\r\nbefore its fall. It thus contains within itself a complete epitome of\r\nall we learn from other sources, and a perfect illustration of all we\r\nknow of Buddhist art or ritual. The 1000 years were complete, and the\r\nstory that opened upon us at Bharhut closes practically at Boro Buddor.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental formative idea of the Boro Buddor monument is that of a\r\ndagoba with five procession-paths. These, however, have become square in\r\nplan instead of circular; and instead of one great domical building in\r\nthe centre we have here seventy-two smaller ones, each containing the\r\nstatue of a Buddha (Woodcut No. 364), visible through an open cage-like\r\nlattice-work; and one larger one in the centre, which was quite solid\r\nexternally (Woodcut No. 365), but had a cell in its centre, which may\r\nhave contained a relic or some precious object. There is, however, no\r\nrecord of anything being found in it when it was broken into. All this\r\nis, of course, an immense development beyond anything we have hitherto\r\nmet with, and a sort of half-way house between the majestic simplicity\r\nof the Abhayagiri at Anuradhapura, and the somewhat tawdry complexity of\r\nthe pagoda at Mengûn (Woodcut No. 354).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 364. Section of one of the smaller Domes at Boro Buddor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 365. Elevation of principal Dome at Boro Buddor. (From\r\nSir S. Raffles’ ‘History of Java.’)]\r\n\r\nWith the idea of a dagoba, however, Boro Buddor also combines that of a\r\nvihara, such as that illustrated by Woodcuts Nos. 66, 67. There the\r\ncells, though only copied solid in the rock, still simulated the\r\nresidences of the monks, and had not yet advanced to the stage we find\r\nin the Gandhara monasteries, where the cells of monks had become niches\r\nfor statues. Here this is carried further than in any example found in\r\nIndia. The cells of the Mahavellipore example are here repeated on every\r\nface, but essentially as niches, and are occupied by 436 statues of\r\nBuddha, seated in the usual cross-legged attitude. In this respect Boro\r\nBuddor is in advance of the Takht-i-Bahi, which is the monument in India\r\nthat most nearly approaches to it in mythological significance. So\r\ngreat, indeed, is the similarity between the two, that whatever date we\r\nassign to the one drags with it that of the other. It would, indeed, be\r\nimpossible to understand how, in the 7th century, Buddhism had been so\r\nfar developed towards the modern Nepalese and Thibetan systems if we had\r\nnot these Gandhara monasteries to fall back upon. On the other hand,\r\nhaving so similar a Buddhist development in Java in the 7th century, it\r\nseems difficult to separate the monuments of the north-west of India\r\nfrom it by any very long interval of time.\r\n\r\nAs will be observed from the plan and elevation (Woodcuts Nos. 362, 363,\r\npage 645), the monument may be described either as a seven or a\r\nnine-storeyed vihara, according as we reckon the platform on which the\r\nseventy-two small dagobas stand as one or three storeys. Its basement\r\nmeasures over 400 ft. across, but the real temple is only 300 ft. from\r\nangle to angle either way. It is not, however, either for its dimensions\r\nor the beauty of its architectural design that Boro Buddor is so\r\nremarkable, as for the sculptures that line its galleries. These extend\r\nto nearly 5000 ft.--almost an English mile--and as there are sculptures\r\non both faces, we have nearly 10,000 lineal ft. of bas-reliefs; or, if\r\nwe like to add those which are in two storeys, we have a series of\r\nsculptures, which, if arranged consecutively in a row, would extend over\r\nnearly three miles of ground. Most of them, too, are singularly well\r\npreserved; for when the Javans were converted to Mahomedanism it was not\r\nin anger, and they were not urged to destroy what they had before\r\nreverenced; they merely neglected them, and, except for earthquakes,\r\nthese monuments would now be nearly as perfect as when first erected.\r\n\r\nThe outer face of the basement, though extremely rich in architectural\r\nornaments and figure-sculptures, is of comparatively little historical\r\nimportance. The first enclosed--or, as the Dutch call it, the\r\nsecond--gallery is, of all the five, the most interesting historically.\r\nOn its inner wall the whole life of Sakya Muni is pourtrayed in 120\r\nbas-reliefs of the most elaborate character. The first twenty-four of\r\nthese are occupied with scenes in the Tusita heavens, or events that\r\ntook place before the birth. In the twenty-fifth we have Maya’s dream,\r\ndepicted exactly as it is at Bharhut or Sanchi, 700 or 800 years\r\nearlier. In the following sculptures it is easy to recognise all the\r\nfamiliar scenes of his life, his marriage, and domestic happiness, till\r\nhe meets the four predictive signs; his subsequent departure from home,\r\nand assumption of the ascetic garb; his life in the forest; his\r\npreaching in the Deer-garden at Benares--the whole Lalita Vistara, in\r\nshort, pourtrayed, with very few variations from the pictures we already\r\npossess from Gandhara to Amravati, with this singular exception: in all\r\nIndian examples the birth and the Nirvana are more frequently repeated\r\nthan any other events; for some reason, not easily guessed, they are\r\nomitted here, though all the events that preceded and followed them are\r\nminutely detailed.[611] Below these bas-reliefs depicting the life of\r\nBuddha is an equally extensive series of 120 bas-reliefs of subjects\r\ntaken from the Jataka, all of which might, no doubt, be easily\r\nidentified, though this has not yet been attempted.\r\n\r\nIn the three galleries above this Buddhism is represented as a religion.\r\nGroups of Buddhas--three, five or nine--are repeated over and over\r\nagain, mixed with Bodhisatwas and saints of all sorts. Among these, the\r\nfive Dhyani Buddhas are conspicuous in all, perhaps more than all, the\r\nvariety of manifestations which are known in Nepal and Thibet,[612]\r\nwhich, as Lassen points out, almost inevitably leads to the conclusion\r\nthat this form of faith was introduced from Nepal or Western\r\nThibet.[613]\r\n\r\nWhether this is exactly so or not, no one probably who is familiar with\r\nBuddhist art in its latest age on the western side of India will\r\nprobably doubt that it was from these parts that the builders of Boro\r\nBuddor migrated. The character of the sculptures, and the details of the\r\nornamentation in cave 26 at Ajunta, and 17 at Nassick, and more\r\nespecially in the later caves at Salsette, at Kondoty, Montpezir, and\r\nother places in that neighbourhood, are so nearly identical with what is\r\nfound in the Javan monument, that the identity of the workmen and\r\nworkmanship is unmistakeable. It is true we have no monument in that\r\npart of India to which we can point that at all resembles Boro Buddor in\r\ndesign, but then it must be borne in mind that there is not a single\r\nstructural Buddhist building now existing within the limits of the cave\r\nregion of Western India. It seems absurd, however, to suppose that so\r\nvast a community confined themselves to caves, and caves only. They must\r\nhave had structural buildings of some sort in their towns and elsewhere,\r\nbut not one fragment of any such now exists, and we are forced to go to\r\nGandhara, in the extreme north-west, for our nearest examples. As\r\nalready pointed out, there are many points of similarity between\r\nJamalgiri, and more especially between Takht-i-Bahi and Boro Buddor; and\r\nif any architect, who was accustomed to such work, would carefully draw\r\nand restore these northern monasteries, many more might become\r\napparent.[614] We know enough even now to render this morally certain,\r\nthough hardly sufficient to prove it in the face of much that may be\r\nbrought forward by those who care to doubt it. Meanwhile, my impression\r\nis, that if we knew as much of these Gandhara monasteries as we know of\r\nBoro Buddor, we could tell the interval of time that separated them,\r\nprobably within half a century at least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 366. View of Central Entrance and Stairs at Boro Buddor.\r\n(From a Lithographic Plate.)]\r\n\r\nStretching such evidence as we at present have, as far as it will bear,\r\nwe can hardly bring the Takht-i-Bahi monastery within one century of\r\nBoro Buddor. It may be two--and Jamalgiri is still one or two centuries\r\nmore distant in time. But, on the other hand, if we had not these\r\nGandhara monasteries to refer to, it would be difficult to believe that\r\nthe northern system of Buddhism could have been so completely developed,\r\neven in the 8th century, as we find it at Boro Buddor. It is this\r\nwonderful progress that has hitherto made the more modern date of that\r\nmonument probable--it looks so much in advance of anything we know of in\r\nIndian Buddhism. But all this we must now revise by the light these\r\nJavan monuments throw on the subject.\r\n\r\nBeing merely a pyramid, situated on the summit of a hill, there were no\r\nconstructive difficulties encountered in the erection of Boro Buddor,\r\nand it is consequently no wonder that it now remains so entire, in spite\r\nof its being, like all Javan buildings, erected wholly without mortar.\r\nIt is curious to observe, however, how faithfully its architects adhered\r\nto the Indian superstition regarding arches. They did not even think it\r\nnecessary to cut off the angles of the corbel-stones, so as to simulate\r\nan arch, though using the pointed-arched forms of the old chaitya caves\r\nof the west. The two systems are well exemplified in the preceding\r\nWoodcut (No. 366), but it runs throughout. All the niches are surmounted\r\nby arch forms--circular, elliptical, or pointed--but all are constructed\r\nhorizontally, and it may be added that, in nine cases out of ten, the\r\nkeystones are adorned with a mask, as in this last example.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENDOET.\r\n\r\nAt a place called Mendoet, about two and a half miles from Boro Buddor,\r\nthere is a temple of a very different class, which, though small, is of\r\nextreme interest for the history of Javan architecture. It stands on a\r\nbasement 70 ft. square, and 15 ft. to 16 ft. high. The temple itself is\r\nabout 45 ft. square, including a projection on each face, which gives it\r\na slightly cruciform shape. Inside is a cell, about 20 ft. square,\r\nroofed by an inverted pyramid of steps, in which are three colossal\r\nimages seated, and about 11 ft. high each. The central one is Buddha,\r\ncurly headed of course, and clad in a diaphanous robe.[615] The two\r\nother colossi, though having only two arms each, are almost certainly\r\nintended for Vishnu and Siva. On one of the faces, externally, is\r\nLaksmi, eight-armed, seated on a lotus, with attendants. On another face\r\nis a figure, four-armed, seated cross-legged on a lotus, the stem of\r\nwhich is supported by two figures with seven-headed snake-hoods. It is\r\nin fact a slightly altered repetition of a group inserted among the\r\nolder sculptures on the façade of the cave at Karli.[616] That insertion\r\nI have always believed to be of the 6th or 7th century; this group is\r\ncertainly slightly more modern. The curious part of the matter is, that\r\nthe Mendoet example is so very much more refined and perfect than that\r\nat Karli. The one seems the feeble effort of an expiring art; the Javan\r\nexample is as refined and elegant as anything in the best ages of Indian\r\nsculpture. The same remarks apply to the sacred tree under which the\r\nfigure is seated. Like all the similar conventional trees at Boro\r\nBuddor, they are complicated and refined beyond any examples known in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe great interest, however, of this little temple arises from the fact\r\nthat it almost certainly succeeded immediately to Boro Buddor. If it is\r\ncorrect to assume A.D. 650-750 as the period during which that temple\r\nwas erected, this one must have been built between A.D. 750 and A.D.\r\n800. It shows, too, a progress in design at a time when Buddhist art in\r\nIndia was marked by decay; and it exhibits such progress in mythology,\r\nthat though there can be no doubt as to the purity of the Buddhism of\r\nBoro Buddor, anyone might fairly argue that this temple belonged either\r\nto that religion or to Hinduism. It is in fact one of those compromises\r\nthat in India would be called Jaina; in other words, one of those\r\ntransitional examples of which we have many in Java, but the want of\r\nwhich leaves such a gap in our history of architecture in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAMBANAM.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of twenty miles south-east from Boro Buddor is a group of\r\ntemples, marking the site of the old Hindu capital of the island, which\r\nare almost as interesting as that great temple itself. They are\r\nunfortunately much less known, or, at all events, have not been\r\nillustrated to anything like the same extent. They are, however, so much\r\nmore ruined, that it may be owing to this that their details have not\r\nbeen so completely made out; but from whatever cause, we cannot speak of\r\nthem with the same confidence as of Boro Buddor.\r\n\r\nThe oldest group at Brambanam seems to be that known as Loro Jongram,\r\nconsisting of six larger temples, enclosed in a wall, and surrounded by\r\nfourteen smaller cells.[617] They may be of the age of Deva Kosuma, or\r\nof the beginning of the 9th century, and possibly are not the earliest\r\nHindu temples here, but till we have more illustrations it is impossible\r\nto speak of this with confidence.\r\n\r\nThe great interest of the place centres in a temple known as the Chandi\r\nSiwa, or, “thousand temples,” which is, or was, when complete, only\r\nsecond to Boro Buddor in interest. The general character of the great\r\ntemple will be understood from the annexed plan of a smaller one at the\r\nsame place (Woodcut No. 367). Both consist of a central temple,\r\nsurrounded by a number of smaller detached cells. In this instance there\r\nare only sixteen such, each of which is supposed to have contained an\r\nimage--Buddha--Jaina, or Saiva, according to the dedication of the\r\ncentral cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 367. Small Temple at Brambanam. (From a Drawing at the\r\nIndia Office.) No scale.]\r\n\r\nIn the great temple the central cell measured 45 ft. each way, and with\r\nthe four attached cells, one of which served as an entrance porch, it\r\nformed a cross 90 ft. each way, the whole being raised on a richly\r\nornamented square base. This building is richly and elaborately\r\nornamented with carving, but with a singular absence of\r\nfigure-sculpture, which renders its dedication not easy to be made out;\r\nbut the most remarkable feature of the whole group is the multitude of\r\nsmaller temples which surround the central one, 238 in number.\r\nImmediately beyond the square terrace which supports the central temple\r\nstand twenty-eight of these--a square of eight on each side, counting\r\nthe angular ones both ways. Beyond these, at a distance of 35 ft., is\r\nthe second square, forty-four in number; between this and the next row\r\nis a wide space of above 80 ft., in which there are only six temples,\r\ntwo in the centre of the north and south faces, and one on each of the\r\nothers. The two outer rows of temples are situated close to one another,\r\nback to back, and are 160 in number, and form a square, each face of\r\nwhich is about 525 ft. All these 238 temples are similar to one another,\r\nabout 12 ft. square at the base, and 22 ft. high,[618] all richly\r\ncarved and ornamented, and in every one is a small square cell, in which\r\nwas originally placed a cross-legged figure, probably of one of the\r\nJaina saints, though the drawings which have been hitherto published do\r\nnot enable us to determine whom they represent--the draughtsmen not\r\nbeing aware of the distinction between Buddhist and Jaina images.\r\n\r\nWhen looked a little closely into, it is evident that the Chandi Siwa is\r\nneither more nor less than Boro Buddor taken to pieces, and spread out,\r\nwith such modifications as were necessary to adapt it to that compromise\r\nbetween Buddhism and Brahmanism which we call Jaina.\r\n\r\nInstead of a central dagoba, with its seventy-two subordinate ones, and\r\nits five procession-paths, with their 436 niches containing figures of\r\nBuddha, we have here a central cell, with four subordinate ones, each\r\ncontaining no doubt similar images, and surrounding these 236 cells,\r\ncontaining images arranged in five rows, with paths between, but not\r\njoined together with sculpture-bearing screens, as in the earlier\r\nexamples, nor joined side by side with the sculpture on their fronts, or\r\ninside, as was invariably the case in similar temples in Gujerat of the\r\nsame age.\r\n\r\nSir Stamford Raffles states A.D. 1098[619] for the completion of this\r\ntemple which, from the internal evidence, I fancy cannot be far from the\r\ntruth. It would, however, be extremely interesting if it could be fixed\r\nwith certainty, as these Javan monuments will probably be found to be\r\nthe only means we have of bridging over the dark ages in India. Already\r\nwe can see that Takht-i-Bahi, Boro Buddor, and Chandi Siwa form\r\nlandmarks in a series extending over at least 500 years, which we may\r\nhope some day to fill up, though the materials for it do not at present\r\nexist. We have not even correct drawings of the pickle-bottle-like cells\r\nof the Gandhara monasteries, and those at Chandi Siwa are so ruined,\r\nthat it is difficult to make out their form. It seems, however, quite\r\nclear that they, with the domes and spires that crown the cells of the\r\nBoro Buddor façade, form parts of one connected series. They are, in\r\nfact, merely developments of one form which, with a little information,\r\nit would be very easy to trace back to its original source.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE AND SERPENT TEMPLES.\r\n\r\nThere is still another class of temples in Java which, when properly\r\ninvestigated, promises to throw great light on some vexed questions of\r\nIndian mythology and art. They are found principally in the provinces\r\nof Kediri and Malang, in the eastern part of the island, and, from dates\r\non some of them, seem to be among the most modern examples of Javan art,\r\nall hitherto known being dated in the century preceding the overthrow of\r\nMajapahit in A.D. 1479.\r\n\r\nFour of these are described by Heer Brumund,[620] but only one, so far\r\nas I know, that of Panataram in Kediri, has been photographed, and no\r\nplans or architectural details of any have yet been published. It is\r\nconsequently difficult to speak with certainty regarding them, but they\r\nare too interesting to be passed over in silence. The annexed woodcut\r\nwill convey some idea of that at Panataram, though necessarily on too\r\nsmall a scale to render all its details recognisable. Generally they may\r\nbe described as three-storeyed pyramids, having a flat platform on the\r\ntop, with a well-hole in its centre open to the sky. In this instance\r\nthe lower platform, so far as I can make out, is about 100 ft. square,\r\nwith a projection or bastion on each face, behind which the stairs\r\nleading to its summit are arranged, as in the great Ceylonese dagobas\r\n(_ante_, p. 190). From this a flight of sixteen steps leads direct to\r\nthe platform of the second, and a similar flight to that of the third\r\nstorey. The basement here is ornamented with numerous bas-reliefs on\r\npanels, representing subjects, taken principally from the ‘Ramayana,’\r\nbut many also from local legends. Each of these is separated from that\r\nnext it, by a panel, with a circular medallion, containing a\r\nconventional animal, or a foliaged ornament. The bas-reliefs of the\r\nsecond storey are better executed, and, from their extent, more\r\ninteresting; their subjects, however, seem to be all taken from local\r\nlegends not yet identified. The third is ornamented by panels, with\r\nwinged figures, griffons, Garudas, and flying monsters, more spirited\r\nand better executed than any similar figures are in any examples of\r\nHindu art I am acquainted with.\r\n\r\nAccording to Heer Brumund, the temple of Toempang is quite equal to\r\nthis. “It is,” he says, “the most beautiful in Melang. It leaves those\r\nof Singa Sari far behind, and may be called the Boro Buddor of\r\nMelang.”[621] Unfortunately we have nothing but verbal descriptions of\r\nthese temples, and of those on the mountain of Sangraham, so it is\r\nimpossible to feel quite sure about their arrangement or appearance; but\r\nas those who have seen them, all describe them as similar, we must be\r\ncontent with this assurance till some photographer visits the place, or,\r\nwhat would be better, till some one goes there who is capable of making\r\na plan and drawing and a few architectural details.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable peculiarity of these terraced temples is that all\r\nhave a well-hole in the centre of their upper platform, extending\r\napparently to their basement. Sometimes it appears to be square, at\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 368. Three-storeyed Terraced Temple at Panataram. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nothers circular, and enlarging as it descends, being 7 ft. or 10 ft.\r\nwide at top.\r\n\r\nBoth Heer Brumund and Dr. Leemans expend a considerable amount of\r\ningenuity in trying to explain the mystery of these well-temples.[622]\r\nBoth assume that the wells were covered with pavilions or cell-temples\r\n(Kamer tempels), but without any warrant, so far as I can make out. At\r\nPanataram, for instance, the parapet of the upper terrace is a frail\r\nstructure, that any man with a crowbar might destroy in a morning, or\r\nany earthquake would certainly shake down; yet neither it nor a single\r\nstone elsewhere in this temple has been displaced; but of this central\r\npavilion not one vestige now remains, either _in situ_ or strewn around.\r\nBesides this, a temple without a floor, and with nothing inside but a\r\n_facilis descensus_ of 20 ft. or 30 ft., and no means _revocare gradum_,\r\ndoes not seem likely to have been popular either with priests or people,\r\nand in fact no form of worship can be suggested that would be suitable\r\nto them. Neither here nor elsewhere does there seem anything to\r\ncontrovert the theory that these wells were always open to the upper\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion that occurs to me as at all likely to meet the case\r\nis that they were Tree-temples; that a sacred tree was planted in these\r\nwell-holes, either on the virgin soil, or that they were wholly or\r\npartially filled with earth and the tree planted in them. The Bo-tree at\r\nBuddh Gaya is planted on a terrace, and raised 30 ft. above the plain,\r\nascended on one side by steps; but no excavations have been made, or at\r\nleast published, which would show whether or not there were three\r\nstoreys on the three other sides. The Naha Vihara at Ceylon, or the\r\ntemple of the Bo-tree, is, in reality, just such a temple as that at\r\nPanataram. It is apparently in five--practically, in three--storeys,\r\nwith the tree planted in a well-hole on its summit. We have,\r\nunfortunately, no plan of it or of the Javan temples; but if any one\r\nwill read Captain Chapman’s description of the Maha Vihara,[623] and\r\ncompare it with Heer Brumund’s of temples in Malang and Kediri,\r\nabstracted by Dr. Leemans,[624] I do not think he can fail to see the\r\nresemblance. No plan has yet been made of the Ceylonese vihara, and such\r\nphotographs as exist have been taken with no higher aim than to make\r\npretty pictures; so that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any\r\ncorrect notions as to its form. Meanwhile the following woodcut (No.\r\n369), copied literally from one in Sir Emerson Tennent’s book, will\r\nconvey an idea of its general appearance. The structure is wholly in\r\nbrick, and its ornamentation was consequently painted on plaster, which\r\nhas wholly[625] disappeared, so that no means of comparison exist\r\nbetween the two modes of decoration. With regard to the Javanese\r\nsculptures on these temples, it is safe to assert that not one of them\r\nshows any trace of Buddhism--none even that could be called Jainism--nor\r\nany trace of the Hindu religion as now known to us. We are, for\r\ninstance, perfectly familiar with the Hindu Pantheon, as illustrated by\r\nthe sculptures of the nearly contemporary temple of Hullabîd (_ante_, p.\r\n402); but not a trace of these gods or goddesses, nor of any of the\r\nmyths there pourtrayed, is to be found in these well-temples. Whatever\r\nthey are, they belong to a religion different from any whose temples we\r\nhave hitherto met with in this volume, but one whose myths pervade the\r\nwhole story of Indian mythology. The worship of trees seems to have been\r\ntaken up in succession by the Buddhists, Jainas, and Vaishnavas, but may\r\nbe earlier than either, and may, in like manner, have survived all\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 369. View of the Maha Vihara, Anuradhapura. (From Sir E.\r\nTennent’s ‘Ceylon.’)]\r\n\r\nIn India, at the present day, there is nothing so common as to see in\r\nthe villages of Bengal little three-storeyed pyramids of mud--exact\r\nmodels of these Javan temples--on the top of which is planted the Tulsi\r\nshrub, the sacred plant of the Vaishnavas (_Ocymum sanctum_, or Sweet\r\nBasil), which succeeded the _Ficus religiosa_ in the affections of the\r\nHindus. Frequently, however, this emblem is planted in vases, or little\r\nmodels of ordinary temples, the top of which is hollowed out for the\r\npurpose. Numbers of these exist also in Java; but no one--at least in\r\nrecent times--having visited the island who was familiar with the\r\nordinary domestic religion of the Hindus, the Dutch antiquarians have\r\nmistaken every model of a dagoba--of which thousands exist in India--and\r\ndescribed it as a lingam, and every Tulsi vase as a Yoni. In most cases\r\nthey are neither the one nor the other. Even this mistake, however, is\r\ninstructive, as it shows how much of their emblems, at least, these\r\nreligions interchanged in the ages of toleration. They are distinct\r\nenough now, but before A.D. 750 it is difficult to draw a line anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt Panataram there is another temple, which, if any one in the island is\r\nentitled to be called a Serpent temple, certainly merits that\r\nappellation. The Batavian Society have devoted twenty-two photographs to\r\nthe illustration of its sculptures, but have given no plan and not one\r\nsyllable of description. There is not even a general view from which its\r\noutline might be gathered, and no figure is introduced from which a\r\nscale might be guessed. Its date appears to be A.D. 1416. The figures,\r\nhowever, from which this is inferred are not on the temple itself but on\r\na bath or tank attached to it, though, from the character of its\r\nsculptures, it is almost certainly coeval.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it is called a Serpent temple is, that the whole of the\r\nbasement-moulding is made up of eight great serpents, two on each face,\r\nwhose upraised heads in the centre form the side pieces of the steps\r\nthat lead up to the central building, whatever that was. These serpents\r\nare not, however, our familiar seven-headed Nagas that we meet with\r\neverywhere in India and Cambodia, but more like the fierce crested\r\nserpents of Central America. The seven-headed serpent does occur very\r\nfrequently among the sculptures at Boro Buddor--never independently,\r\nhowever, nor as an object to be worshipped, but as adorning the heads of\r\na Naga people who come to worship Buddha or to take a part in the\r\nvarious scenes represented there. Even then they are very unlike the\r\nIndian Naga, whose hood is unmistakably that of an expanded cobra. Those\r\nat Boro Buddor and Panataram are crested snakes, like that represented\r\nin the Japanese woodcut in ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ page 56.\r\n\r\nThe sculptures on these monuments are not of a religious or mythological\r\ncharacter, but either historical or domestic. What they represent may\r\neasily be ascertained, for above each scene is a short descriptive\r\ninscription, quite perfect, and in a character so modern that I fancy\r\nany scholar on the spot might easily read them. It, probably, has been\r\ndone, but our good friends the Dutch are never in a hurry, and we must,\r\nconsequently, wait.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is curious to observe that we know of only two monuments in\r\nour whole history which are so treated, and these the earliest and the\r\nlast of the great school:[626] that at Bharhut, so often alluded to\r\nabove, erected two centuries before Christ; and this one, erected in\r\nthe 15th century, while the struggle with the Mahomedan religion was\r\ngathering around it that strength, which, within half a century from\r\nthat time, finally extinguished the faith to which it belonged.\r\n\r\nThere is one other temple of this class at a place called Matjanpontih,\r\nregarding which some more information would be interesting. It is\r\ndescribed by Heer Brumund as partly of brick, partly of stone, but\r\nsingularly rich in ornamentation. “The sub-basement,” he says, “is\r\ncomposed of a tortoise and two serpents; the heads of these three\r\nanimals unite on the west face and form the entrance.”[627]\r\n\r\nThis and many others of the description are nearly unintelligible\r\nwithout illustrations, but many of them seem to point to a class of\r\nSerpent temples, which, if better known, might throw considerable light\r\non the mystery that still shrouds that form of faith in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nDJEING PLATEAU.\r\n\r\nOn an elevated plateau, near the centre of the island, on the back of\r\nMount Prahu, there exists a group of some five or six small temples.\r\nThey are not remarkable either for the size or the beauty of their\r\ndetails, when compared with those of the buildings we have just been\r\ndescribing; but they are interesting to the Indian antiquary, because\r\nthey are Indian temples pure and simple and dedicated to Indian gods. So\r\nfar, we feel at home again; but what these temples tell us further is,\r\nthat if Java got her Buddhism from Gujerat and the mouths of the Indus,\r\nshe got her Hinduism from Telingana and the mouths of the Kistnah. These\r\nDjeing temples do not show a trace of the curved-lined sikras of Orissa\r\nor of the Indo-Aryan style. Had the Hindus gone to Java from the valley\r\nof the Ganges, it is almost impossible they should not have carried with\r\nthem some examples of this favourite form. It is found in Burmah and\r\nSiam, but no trace of it is found anywhere in Java.\r\n\r\nNor are these temples Dravidian in any proper sense of the word. They\r\nare in storeys, but not with cells, nor any reminiscences of such; but\r\nthey are Chalukyan, in a clear and direct meaning of the term. The\r\nbuilding most like these Javan temples illustrated in the preceding\r\npages is that at Buchropully (Woodcut No. 216), which would pass\r\nwithout remark in Java if deprived of its portico. It, however, like all\r\nthe Chalukyan temples we know of in India, especially in the Nizam’s\r\nterritory, is subsequent to the 10th century. Most of them belong to the\r\n13th century, and pillars may probably have been less frequently used at\r\nthe time of Deva Kosuma’s visit in A.D. 816. Be this as it may, it is a\r\nremarkable fact that there is not a single pillar in Java: at least no\r\nbook I have had access to, no drawing, and no photograph gives a hint of\r\nthe existence of even one pillar in the island. When we think of the\r\nthousands that were employed by the Dravidians in the south of India,\r\nand the Jains in the north-west, it is curious they escaped being\r\nintroduced here. The early style of Orissa, as mentioned above, is\r\nnearly astylar; but in Java this is absolutely so, and, so far as I\r\nknow, is the only important style in the world of which this can be\r\npredicated. What is not so curious, but is also interesting, is, that\r\nthere is not a true arch in the whole island. In the previous pages, the\r\nHindu horror of an arch has often been alluded to; but then they\r\nfrequently got out of the difficulty by the use of wood or iron. There\r\nis no trace of the use of these materials in the island, and no\r\npeculiarly Javan feature can be traced to a wooden original. All is in\r\nstone, but without either the pillars or the arches which make up\r\nnine-tenths of the constructive expedients of the mediæval architects,\r\nand figure so largely in all the western styles of architectural art.\r\n\r\nIt may also be mentioned here, while describing the negative\r\ncharacteristics of Javan art, that no mortar is ever used as a cement in\r\nthese temples. It is not that they were ignorant of the use of lime, for\r\nmany of their buildings are plastered and painted on the plaster, but it\r\nwas never employed to give strength to construction. It is owing to this\r\nthat so many of their buildings are in so ruinous a state. In an island\r\nwhere earthquakes are frequent, a very little shake reduces a tall\r\ntemple to a formless heap in a few seconds. If cemented, they might have\r\nbeen cracked, but not so utterly ruined as they now are.[628]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the Javan style of architecture is probably the only\r\none of which it can be said that it reached a high degree of perfection\r\nwithout using either pillars, or arches, or mortar in any of its\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUKU.\r\n\r\nAt a place called Suku, not far from Mount Lawu near the centre of the\r\nisland, there is a group of temples, which, when properly illustrated,\r\npromises to be of great importance to the history of architecture in\r\nJava.[629] They are among the most modern examples of the style, having\r\ndates upon them of A.D. 1435 and A.D. 1440,[630] or less than forty\r\nyears before the destruction of Majapahit and the abolition of the Hindu\r\nreligion of Java. So far as can be made out, they are coarser and more\r\nvulgar in execution than any of those hitherto described, and belonged\r\nto a degraded form of the Vaishnava religion. Garuda is the most\r\nprominent figure among the sculptures; but there is also the tortoise,\r\nthe boar, and other figures that belong to that religion. The\r\nsculptures, too, are said, many of them, to be indecent, which is only\r\ntoo characteristic a feature of Vishnuism.[631]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature connected with the remains at Suku, as well\r\nas of all the later buildings in Java, is their extraordinary likeness\r\nto the contemporary edifices in Yucatan, and Mexico. It may be only\r\naccidental, but it is unmistakable. No one, probably, who is at all\r\nfamiliar with the remains found in the two provinces, can fail to\r\nobserve it, though no one has yet suggested any hypothesis to account\r\nfor it. When we look at the vast expanse of ocean that stretches between\r\nJava and Central America, it seems impossible to conceive that any\r\nmigration can have taken place eastward--say after the 10th\r\ncentury--that could have influenced the arts of the Americans; or, if it\r\nhad taken place, that the Javans would not have taught them the use of\r\nalphabetical writing, and of many arts they cultivated, but of which the\r\nAmericans were ignorant when discovered by the Spaniards. It seems\r\nequally improbable or impossible that any colonists from America could\r\nhave planted themselves in Java so as to influence the arts of the\r\npeople. But there is a third supposition that may be possible, and, if\r\nso, may account for the observed facts. It is possible that the building\r\nraces of Central America are of the same family as the native\r\ninhabitants of Java. Many circumstances lead to the belief that the\r\ninhabitants of Easter Island belong to the same stock,[632] and, if this\r\nis so, it is evident that distance is no bar to the connexion. If this\r\nhypothesis may be admitted, the history of the connexion would be\r\nthis:--The Javans were first taught to build monumental edifices by\r\nimmigrants from India, and we know that their first were their finest\r\nand also the most purely Indian. During the next five centuries (A.D.\r\n650-1150) we can watch the Indian influence dying out; and during the\r\nnext three (A.D. 1150-1450) a native local style developing itself,\r\nwhich resulted at last in the quasi-American examples at Panataram and\r\nSuku. It may have been that it was the blood and the old faith and\r\nfeelings of these two long dissevered branches of one original race that\r\ncame again to the surface, and produced like effects in far distant\r\nlands. If this or something like it were not the cause of the\r\nsimilarity, it must have been accidental, and, if so, is almost the only\r\ninstance of its class known to exist anywhere; and, strangely enough,\r\nthe only other example that occurs is in respect to the likeness that is\r\nunmistakable between certain Peruvian buildings and the Pelasgic remains\r\nof Italy and Greece. These, however, are even more remote in date and\r\nlocality, so the subject must remain in its present uncertainty till\r\nsome fresh discovery throws new light upon it.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the place, even if space were available, to\r\nattempt to investigate and settle such questions; but it is well to\r\nbroach them even here, for, unless attention is directed to the subject,\r\nthe phænomena are not observed with that intelligent care which is\r\nindispensable for the elucidation of so difficult a problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe above is, it must be confessed, only a meagre outline of what might\r\nbe made one of the most interesting and important chapters in the\r\nHistory of Indian Architecture. To do it justice, however, it would\r\nrequire at least 100 illustrations and 200 pages of text, which would\r\nswell this work beyond the dimensions within which it seems at present\r\nexpedient to restrict it. Even, however, were it determined to attempt\r\nthis, the materials do not exist in Europe for performing it in a\r\nsatisfactory manner. We know all we want, or are ever likely to know,\r\nabout Boro Buddor and one or two other monuments, but with regard to\r\nmost of the others our information is most fragmentary, and in respect\r\nto some, absolutely deficient. Any qualified person might, by a six\r\nmonths’ tour in the island, so co-ordinate all this as to supply the\r\ndeficiencies to such an extent as to be able to write a full and\r\nsatisfactory History of Architecture in Java. But it is not probable\r\nthat the necessary information for this purpose will be available in\r\nEurope for some years to come, and it may be many--very many--unless the\r\nwork is undertaken on a more systematic plan than has hitherto been the\r\ncase. Both in this island and in Ceylon the intentions have been good,\r\nbut the performance disappointing and unsatisfactory. The Dutch have,\r\nhowever, far outstripped our colonial authorities, not only in the care\r\nof their monuments, but in the extent to which they have published them.\r\nIt is only to be hoped that a wholesome rivalry will, before long,\r\nrender the architectural productions of both islands available for the\r\npurposes of scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCAMBODIA.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nIntroductory--Temples of Nakhon Wat, Ongcor Thom, Paten ta Phrohm, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nSince the exhumation of the buried cities of Assyria by Mons. Botta and\r\nMr. Layard nothing has occurred so startling, or which has thrown so\r\nmuch light on Eastern art, as the discovery of the ruined cities of\r\nCambodia. Historically, they are infinitely less important to us than\r\nthe ruins of Nimroud and Nineveh; but, in an architectural point of\r\nview, they are more astonishing; and, for the elucidation of certain\r\nIndian problems, it seems impossible to overrate their importance.\r\n\r\nThe first European who visited these ruins in modern times was M.\r\nMouhot, a French naturalist, who devoted the last four years of his life\r\n(1858-1861) to the exploration of the valleys of the Mekong and Menam\r\nrivers. Though the primary object of his travels was to investigate the\r\nnatural productions of the country, he seems to have been so struck with\r\nthe ruins of Ongcor Wat that he not only sketched and made plans of\r\nthem, but wrote descriptions of all the principal buildings.\r\nUnfortunately for science and art he never returned to Europe, being\r\nstruck down by fever while prosecuting his researches in the northern\r\npart of the country; and, though his notes have been published both in\r\nthis country[633] and in France, they were not prepared for publication\r\nby himself, and want the explanatory touches which only an author can\r\ngive to his own work. Though his melancholy death prevented M. Mouhot\r\nfrom obtaining all the credit he was entitled to for his discovery, it\r\nhas borne rich fruit as far as the public are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe next person who visited these ruins was the very learned Dr. Adolph\r\nBastian;[634] who has written a most recondite but most unsatisfactory\r\nwork on the Indo-Chinese nations, in five volumes. He has also written\r\nan account of the ruins in the ‘Journal of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety’ (Vol. xxxv.), and four papers in the ‘Ausland’ (Nos. 47-50). It\r\nis impossible to find out from all these whether Dr. Bastian has\r\nsatisfied himself who built these temples, what their age is, or to what\r\nworship they are dedicated. If he does know anything about these\r\nmatters, he has carefully concealed it from the uninitiated, under a\r\nconfused mass of undigested learning that it is impossible to fathom.\r\n\r\nHis visit to these ruins was followed by that of Mr. J. Thomson, a\r\nprofessional photographer at Singapore, who, at considerable expense and\r\nrisk, carried his photographic apparatus to the spot, and brought away a\r\nplan of the great temple of Nakhon Wat, with some thirty photographs of\r\nit, besides views of other places in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSince that time the French have sent two thoroughly well equipped\r\nexpeditions to the place: the first under a Captain Doudart de la Grée\r\nin 1866, the second in 1873. As the main object of the first was the\r\nexploration of the Mekong river, they were able to devote only a portion\r\nof their time to antiquarian researches, and the unfortunate death of\r\ntheir chief on the frontiers of China prevented his ever working out his\r\nresults to the extent he no doubt would have done had he lived to return\r\nhome. They were, however, published as he left them, by Lieutenant J.\r\nGarnier, the second in command of the expedition, with notes and\r\nadditions of his own.[635]\r\n\r\nAs they, however, could not complete the investigation, a second\r\nexpedition was fitted out, under Captain Delaporte, who had taken part\r\nin the previous expedition.\r\n\r\nThey returned to France in 1874, bringing with them not only detailed\r\nplans of most of the temples, but copies of nearly all the inscriptions\r\nthey could find, and a large collection of antiquities and casts. The\r\nlatter are now arranged in the Château of Compiègne, and accessible to\r\nthe public. The drawings and inscriptions are in course of publication,\r\nand, when available, they will supply materials from which we may reason\r\nwith confidence, not only as to the arts but as to the history of this\r\nwonderful people.[636] At present we are hardly in a position to do so.\r\nWhat has hitherto been collected has been got together in too\r\nfragmentary a manner, and it has not yet gone through the sifting\r\nprocess which is indispensable before it is possible to separate the\r\nwheat from the chaff.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these sources of information there is a most interesting\r\naccount, written by a Chinese traveller, who spent two years in the\r\ncountry when the kingdom was in its most flourishing state, between the\r\nyears 1295-97. He was a Buddhist, and, like his predecessors in India,\r\nFa Hian and Hiouen Thsang, sees things a little too much through\r\nBuddhist spectacles; but, with this slight defect, nothing can be more\r\ngraphic than his account of the country and the people.[637]\r\n\r\nThere are also two papers, by Col. James Low, in the ‘Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal’ (Vol. xvii.), which are replete with\r\ntraditional information extracted from Siamese books.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first assertion in the traditions of the Cambodians, as gathered by\r\nDr. Bastian, is sufficiently startling. “In the country of Rome or\r\nRomaveisei, not far from Takkhasinla (Taxila), reigned a great and wise\r\nking. His son, the Vice King--Phra Thong by name--having done wrong, was\r\nbanished, and, after many adventures, settled in Cambodia,” &c.[638] The\r\ntime is not indicated, but we gather from the context that it must have\r\nbeen about the 4th century. It may, at first sight, look like catching\r\nat a nominal similarity, but the troubles which took place in Kashmir in\r\nthe reign of Tungina, and generally in western India about the year 319,\r\nlook so like what is recorded further east, that, at present, that seems\r\nthe most probable date for the migration, assuming it to have taken\r\nplace. Many would be inclined to doubt the possibility of any\r\ncommunication between the two countries; but it must be borne in mind,\r\nthat the country around Taxila in ancient times was called Camboja; that\r\nit was the head-quarters of Serpent-worship; that the architecture of\r\nKashmir bears very considerable resemblance to that of Cambodia; while\r\nthere is a general consent that the Cambodians came from India. If this\r\nwere so, it seems certain that it was not from the east coast that they\r\nmigrated. As pointed out above, the Indians who introduced Buddhism and\r\nBuddhist architecture into Java went there from Gujerat or the countries\r\non the west coast. This hardly seems doubtful, and there is no greater\r\nimprobability of a migration from the Indus to Cambodia than of one from\r\nGujerat to Java.\r\n\r\nCeylon was always addicted to Snake-worship, and may have formed a\r\nhalf-way house. On the other hand, it is by no means improbable that the\r\ncommunication may have taken place behind the Himalayas; in fact, that\r\nthe religion of the two countries was derived from some common centre in\r\nNorthern Asia.\r\n\r\nAll this will require careful elaboration hereafter, in some place where\r\nit can be more fully treated than is possible here. All that is wanted\r\nnow is to insist on the fact that there must have been a connexion\r\nbetween the two countries, and that the traditions of Cambodia point to\r\nTaxila as their parent seat.\r\n\r\nFor six centuries from this time we have nothing but stories of\r\ndragon-kings and their beautiful but troublesome daughters; of the\r\ntreasures and relics they guarded; and of the spells and enchantments\r\nwhich were had recourse to to vanquish and rob them. All this is common\r\nto all the nations between Cambodia and the North Cape of Norway, but\r\ndoes not concern us here.\r\n\r\nAt last we come to a fact. “In the year 957 Inthapathapuri was founded\r\nby King Pathummasurivong.”[639] In the same manner as the name of the\r\nold capital of Siam was the mispronunciation of Ayodhya, so this is only\r\nthe Cambodian way of spelling Indraprastha, or the old Delhi of the\r\n‘Mahabharata.’\r\n\r\nLeaping over the intermediate space from this initial date we have a\r\nfinal one in the conquest of the country by the Siamese (A.D.\r\n1351-1374), after which time the old capital was deserted, and no more\r\ntemples were erected there. Our architectural history is thus confined\r\nto the four centuries which elapsed between 951 and 1357. For the first\r\nthree of these, at least, Nakhon[640] Thom--the Great City--was the\r\ncapital. About the middle, however, of the 13th century, the king was\r\nafflicted with leprosy “because he had forsaken the Snake-worship of his\r\nforefathers,” and taken to the Brahmanical or Buddhist heresy, it is not\r\nquite clear which; and the capital was then transferred to a site some\r\nfifteen miles further east, and a city built, known as Paten ta Phrohm\r\n(the City of Brahma?).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we have at least three centuries during which Naga-worship\r\nprevailed--giving rise to the erection of a series of temples as large\r\nand as richly ornamented as any to be found in any other part of the\r\nworld. The last of these--that known as Nakhon Wat--was, if not the\r\ngreatest, at least the best from an architectural point of view, and is\r\nthe only one of which we have at present sufficient information to speak\r\nwith confidence.\r\n\r\nFrom the little we know of the others it does not seem that there would\r\nbe any difficulty in arranging them all in a chronological series, from\r\nthe gradations of style they exhibit; nor of ascertaining their dates,\r\nsince they are covered with inscriptions in a character that could be\r\nread without serious trouble; and these probably contain the names of\r\nthe kings, which would enable this to be done, approximatively at least,\r\neven if there should be no dates.\r\n\r\nThe buildings of Paten ta Phrohm (the Brahmanical) are of a much more\r\nvaried but less perfect style. They seem, from the descriptions of M.\r\nMouhot and Dr. Bastian, to be Buddhist, Jaina, or Hindu, or all these\r\nstyles mixed up together as in Java. In fact, they seem very much to\r\nresemble the buildings in that island, and their date is about the same,\r\nomitting only the Buddhist series, which does not seem to occur here;\r\nbut, as no detailed drawings or good photographs of them have yet been\r\npublished, there is very little to be said about them now. For the\r\npresent our attention must be principally confined to the city of\r\nOngcor--or Ongon, as it is popularly named, but more correctly known as\r\nNakhon Thom--the great city--and especially to the suburban monastery of\r\nNakhon Wat.\r\n\r\nIt is now not difficult to point out the situation of this city, as the\r\nlake near which it is situated and the hills that approach it have\r\ngenerally now found their way into most atlases. Generally it may be\r\nsaid that about half-way between the great rivers of Siam and Cambodia\r\nis a lake, the Tali Sab, about 120 miles long, and varying in width from\r\n30 to 60. In the dry weather its average depth is only 4 ft., but in the\r\nrains it is fed by the Mekong, of which it is a backwater, and rises 30\r\nft. or 40 ft. more, so that it is easily navigable for large boats. At a\r\nlittle distance from the northern shore of this lake, in 103° 50´ East\r\nlongitude and 13° 30´ North latitude, the ruins are to be found,\r\nsituated in a great plain extending some fifty miles in width between\r\nthe lake and the hills on its northern boundary.[641]\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE OF NAKHON WAT.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Nakhon Wat, literally “the temple of the city,” or “of the\r\ncapital,” as it is now called by the Siamese, is situated in a sandy\r\nplain, about four miles to the southward of the city of Ongcor itself,\r\nand between it and the lake Tali Sab. As will be seen from the small\r\nplan (figure 2, Woodcut No. 370) it is almost an exact square, and\r\nmeasures nearly an English mile each way. The walled\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 370. Plan of Temple of Nakhon Wat. (From a Survey by Mr.\r\nJ. Thomson.) Scale 155 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\nenclosure of the temple measures 1080 yards by 1100, and is surrounded\r\nby a moat or ditch 230 yards wide. The moat is crossed on the west by a\r\nsplendid causeway, adorned by pillars on either side. This leads to the\r\ngreat gateway, not unlike the gopura of a Dravidian temple, five storeys\r\nin height, but extended by lateral galleries and towers to a façade more\r\nthan 600 ft. in extent. Within this a second raised causeway, 370 yards\r\nlong, leads to a cruciform platform in front of the temple (shown in\r\nfigure 1, Woodcut No. 370). On either side of this, about half-way down,\r\nis a detached temple, which anywhere else would be considered of\r\nimportance, but here may be passed over.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the temple will be understood from the woodcut (No.\r\n370). It consists of three enclosures, one within the other, each raised\r\nfrom 15 ft. to 20 ft. above the level of that outside it, so as to give\r\nthe whole a pyramidal form. The outer enclosure measures 570 ft. by 650\r\nft., and covers, therefore, about 370,000 sq. ft. The great temple at\r\nKarnac (Thebes) covers 430,000 sq. ft. There are three portals, adorned\r\nwith towers on each face, and on either side of these are open galleries\r\nor verandahs, which, with their bas-reliefs, are probably the most\r\nremarkable features of this temple. Their external appearance will be\r\nunderstood from the Woodcut No. 373; that of the interior from Woodcut\r\nNo. 374; though these illustrations are on too small a scale to do\r\njustice to their magnificence.\r\n\r\nIts appearance in elevation may be gathered from Woodcut No. 371, which\r\nshows it to be a pyramid more than 600 ft. in breadth across its\r\nshortest width north and south, and rising to 180 ft. at the summit of\r\nthe central tower. It is, consequently, both larger and higher than Boro\r\nBuddor, and notwithstanding the extraordinary elaboration of that temple\r\nit is probably surpassed by this one, both in the extent of its\r\nornamentation as well as in the delicacy of its carvings. There may have\r\nbeen as much, or nearly as much, labour bestowed on the colonnades at\r\nRamisseram as on this temple; but otherwise the Indian example cannot\r\ncompare with either of these two. It has literally no outline, and\r\npractically no design; while both Nakhon Wat and Boro Buddor are as\r\nremarkable for their architectural designs as for their sculptural\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical arrangements of the galleries or colonnades above\r\nreferred to are as perfect as their artistic design. These will be\r\nunderstood from the diagram, Woodcut No. 372. On one side is a solid\r\nwall of the most exquisite masonry, supporting the inner terrace of the\r\ntemple. It is built of large stones without cement, and so beautifully\r\nfitted that it is difficult to detect the joints between two stones. At\r\na distance of 10 ft. 6 in. in front of this stands a range of square\r\npiers, very much in the proportion of the Roman Doric order, with\r\ncapitals also similar to the classical examples, but more ornamented.\r\nThese pillars have no bases, but on each face is carved a figure of a\r\ndevotee or worshipper, surmounted by a canopy of incised ornament, which\r\nis also carried along the edge of the shafts. The pillars carry an\r\narchitrave and a deep frieze, which, in the inner part of the temple, is\r\nornamented with bas-reliefs of the most elaborate character, and above\r\nthis is a cornice of very classical outline. Above the cornices is a\r\npointed arch, not formed with voussoirs, but of stones projecting one\r\nbeyond the other, as with the old Pelasgi and the Indians to the present\r\nday. This is quite plain, and was probably originally intended to be\r\nhidden by a wooden ceiling, as indicated in the diagram; at least, Mr.\r\nThomson discovered the mortises which were intended to secure some such\r\nadornment, and in one place the remains of a teak-wood ceiling\r\nbeautifully and elaborately carved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 371. Elevation of the Temple of Nakhon Wat. (From a\r\ndrawing by Lieutenant Garnier.)]\r\n\r\nOutside this gallery, as shown in the Woodcuts Nos. 372, 373, is a\r\nsecond, supported by shorter pillars, with\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 372. Diagram Section of Corridor, Nakhon Wat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 373. View of Exterior of Nakhon Wat. (From a Photograph\r\nby Mr. J. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nboth base and capital. This outer range supports what may be called a\r\ntie-beam, the one end of which is inserted into the inner column just\r\nbelow the capital. So beautifully, however, is this fitted that M.\r\nMouhot asserts the inner columns are monoliths, and, like the other\r\njoints of the masonry, the junction cannot be detected even in the\r\nphotograph unless pointed out. The beauty of this arrangement will at\r\nonce strike anyone who knows how difficult it is to keep the sun out and\r\nlet in the light and air, so indispensable in that climate. The British\r\nhave tried to effect it in India for 100 years, but never hit on\r\nanything either so artistic or convenient as this. It is, in fact, the\r\nsolution of a problem over which we might have puzzled for centuries,\r\nbut which the Cambodians resolved instinctively. The exterior cornice\r\nhere, as throughout the temple, is composed of infinite repetitions of\r\nthe seven-headed snake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 374. View of Interior of Corridor, Nakhon Wat. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Mr. J. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful parts, however, of these colonnades of Nakhon Wat,\r\nare the sculptures that adorn their walls, rather than the architecture\r\nthat shelters them. These are distributed in eight compartments, one on\r\neach side of the four central groups of entrances, measuring each from\r\n250 ft. to 300 ft. in length, with a height of about 6½ ft. Their\r\naggregate length is thus at least 2000 ft., and assuming the parts\r\nphotographed to be a fair average, the number of men and animals\r\nrepresented extends from 18,000 to 20,000. The relief is so low that in\r\nthe photograph it looks at first sight as if incised--_intagliato_--like\r\nthe Egyptian sculptures; but this is not the case. Generally speaking,\r\nthese reliefs represent battle-scenes of the most animated description,\r\ntaken from the ‘Ramayana,’ or ‘Mahabharata,’ which the immigrants either\r\nbrought with them, or, as the Siamese annals say, received from India in\r\nthe 4th or 5th century. These, Pathammasurivong, the founder of the\r\ncity, caused to be translated into Cambodian, with considerable\r\nvariations, and here they are sculptured almost _in extenso_.[642]\r\n\r\nOne bas-relief, however, is occupied by a different subject--popularly\r\nsupposed to represent heaven, earth, and hell. Above is a procession so\r\nclosely resembling those in Egyptian temples as to be startling. The\r\nking is borne in a palanquin very like those seen in the sculptures on\r\nthe banks of the Nile, and accompanied by standards and emblems which go\r\nfar to complete the illusion. In the middle row sits a judge, with a\r\nnumerous body of assessors, and the condemned are thrown down to a lower\r\nregion, where they are represented as tortured in all the modes which\r\nEastern ingenuity has devised. It is not clear, however, that this is a\r\ntheological hell; it seems more probable that it represents the mode in\r\nwhich the Indian immigrants “improved” the natives. One subject alone\r\ncan be called mythological, and it wears an old familiar face; it\r\nrepresents the second Avatar of Vishnu, the world-supporting tortoise,\r\nand the churning of the ocean with the great snake Naga. No legend in\r\nHindu mythology could be more appropriate for a snake-temple; but,\r\nnotwithstanding this, it is out of place, and I cannot help fancying\r\nthat it was his choice of this subject that gave rise to the tradition\r\nthat the king was afflicted with leprosy because he had deserted the\r\nfaith of his forefathers. This relief is evidently the last attempted,\r\nand still remains unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe only other temples that I am aware of where sculpture is used in\r\nanything like the same profusion are those at Boro Buddor in Java and\r\nthat at Hullabîd, described above, page 401. In the Indian example,\r\nhowever, the principles on which it is employed are diametrically\r\nopposed to those in vogue in Cambodia. There all the sculptures are in\r\nhigh relief, many of the figures standing free, and all are essential\r\nparts of the architecture--are, in fact, the architecture itself. Here,\r\nhowever, the two arts are kept quite distinct and independent, each\r\nmutually aiding the other, but each perfect by itself, and separate in\r\nits aim. The Gothic architects attempted to incorporate their sculpture\r\nwith the architecture in the same manner as the Indian architects. The\r\nGreeks, on the contrary, kept them distinct; they provided a plain wall\r\noutside the cella of the temple for their paintings and sculpture, and\r\nprotected it by screens of columns precisely as the Cambodians did; and\r\nit is difficult to say which was the best principle. A critic imbued\r\nwith the feelings of mediæval art would side with the Indians; but if\r\nthe Greeks were correct in their principle, so certainly were the\r\nCambodians.\r\n\r\nLeaving these outer peristyles for the present, and entering by the west\r\ndoor, we find ourselves in an ante-naos measuring 180 ft. by 150 ft.,\r\nsupported by more than 100 columns, and lighted by four small courts\r\nopen to the sky above; but the floors, as in all Naga temples, are tanks\r\nor reservoirs for water. The whole of this part is arranged most\r\nartistically, so as to obtain the most varied and picturesque effects,\r\nand is as well worthy of study as any part of the temple. Beyond this,\r\non either hand, is a detached temple, similar in plan to those that\r\nstand on either side of the causeway, half-way between the entrance and\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\nAscending from this we enter the middle court, in the centre of which\r\nstands what may be considered as the temple itself. It measures 200 ft.\r\nby 213 ft., and is crowned by five towers or spires, one on each angle,\r\nand one, taller than the others, in the centre, rising to a height of\r\n180 ft. The central tower has four cells, like that at Sadri, one facing\r\neach way. The general appearance of these towers may be gathered from\r\nthe elevation (Woodcut No. 371), and from Woodcut No. 375. They are very\r\nIndian in character and outline, but, when looked closely into, are\r\nunlike anything known in that country. The building which resembles the\r\ninner temple most, so far as at present known, is that at Sadri (Woodcut\r\nNo. 133). Its dimensions are nearly the same, 200 ft. by 225 ft.; like\r\nthis, it has five spires similarly disposed, and four open courts; and\r\nat Sadri, as here, there are a certain number of snake-images, which\r\nsuggest a connexion between the two. But there the similarity ceases.\r\nThe extraordinary amount of richness and exuberance of detail in the\r\nCambodian temple far surpasses that of the Indian example; and the\r\ncourts at Nakhon Wat are not courts but water-tanks. How far the lower\r\ncourts were also capable of being flooded is not clear, nor whether the\r\nwhole area, 1100 yards square, in which the temple stands, was not also\r\ncapable of being turned into a lake.[643] Judging from the analogy of\r\nthe Kashmiri temples, it would seem probable that this may have been the\r\ncase. If it were, it is difficult to conceive a more fairy-like scene\r\nthan this temple would have presented, rising from the lake which\r\nreflected its forms in the calm stillness of a tropical sunset.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious circumstances connected with the architecture of\r\nthis temple is, that all its pillars are as essentially of the Roman\r\nDoric order, as those of Kashmir are of the Grecian Doric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 375. General View of Temple of Nakhon Wat. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Mr. J. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nEven if this is disputed, one thing at least is certain, that no such\r\npillars occur anywhere in India. At Nakhon Wat there is not a single\r\nbracket-capital nor an Indian base. The pillars nowhere change into\r\noctagons or polygons of sixteen or thirty-two sides,[644] and all the\r\nentablatures are as unlike Indian forms as can well be conceived. At\r\nNakhon Wat, also, there are intersecting vaults and ingenious\r\nroofing-contrivances of all sorts, but no dome, and no hint that the\r\narchitects were aware of the existence of such a form. On the contrary,\r\ntake such a pillar as that shown in Woodcut No. 376: the proportion of\r\ndiameter to height; the entasis; the proportion between the upper and\r\nlower diameter; the capital with its abacus; the base with its plinth;\r\nthe architrave, &c., are so like the Roman order that it is difficult to\r\nconceive the likeness being accidental.\r\n\r\nBut whoever gave the design for these pillars--and, according to M.\r\nMouhot, there are 1532 of them in this single building--we have abundant\r\nevidence to show that the people for whom it was erected were of pure\r\nTuranian blood. Without insisting on other facts, there are in every\r\npart of the building groups of female figures in alto-relievo. They are\r\nsometimes in niches or in pairs, as in the Woodcut No. 377, attached to\r\npilasters, or in groups of four or more. There are a hundred or more in\r\nvarious parts of the building, and all have the thick lips and the flat\r\nnoses of true Tartars, their eyes forming an angle with one another like\r\nthose of the Egyptians, or any other of the true building-races of the\r\nworld. Unfortunately, no statues of men are so attached, though there\r\nare several free-standing figures which tell the same tale. The\r\nbas-reliefs do not help in the inquiry, as the artist has taken pains to\r\ndistinguish carefully the ethnographic peculiarities of all the nations\r\nrepresented, and, till the inscriptions are read, and we know who are\r\nintended for Indians or who for Chinese or Cambodians, we cannot use the\r\nevidence they supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 376. Pillar of Porch, Nakhon Wat.\r\n\r\n(From a Photograph by Mr. J. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that, wherever Serpent-worship prevailed in any\r\npart of the world, it was the custom to devote the most beautiful young\r\ngirls to the service of the temple. This would not only account for\r\nthese numerous female statues, but their presence affords a hint of the\r\nworship to which it was dedicated. This, however, is not required; for,\r\nthough the god is gone, and the Buddhists have taken possession of the\r\ntemple, everywhere the Snake-god appears. Every angle of every roof is\r\nadorned with an image of the seven-headed snake, and there are hundreds\r\nof them; every cornice is composed of snakes’ heads; every convolution\r\nof the roofs, and there are thousands, terminates in a five or\r\nseven-headed snake. The balustrades are snakes, and the ridge of every\r\nroof was apparently adorned with gilt dragons. These being in metal,\r\nhave disappeared, but the holes into which they were fixed can still be\r\nseen on every ridge.\r\n\r\nThere is no image in the sanctuary, of course, because it is the\r\npeculiarity of this religion that the god is a living god, and dies, or\r\nis eaten up by his fellow divinities, so that no trace of him remains.\r\nBut, beyond all this, the water-arrangements which pervade every part of\r\nthe great temple are such as belong to the worship of the Serpent, and\r\nto that only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 377. Lower Part of Pilaster, Nakhon Wat. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Mr. F. J. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nAt present this temple has been taken possession of by Siamese bonzes,\r\nwho have dedicated it to the worship of Buddha. They have introduced\r\nimages of him into the sanctuaries and other places, and, with the usual\r\nincuriousness of people of their class, assert that it was always so;\r\nwhile, unfortunately, no one who has yet visited the place has been so\r\nfamiliar with Buddhist architecture as to be able to contradict them.\r\nIf, however, there is one thing more certain than another in this\r\nhistory, it is that Nakhon Wat was not originally erected by Buddhists\r\nor for Buddhist purposes. In the first place, there is no sign of a\r\ndagoba or of a vihara, or of a chaitya hall in the whole building, nor\r\nanything that can be called a reminiscence of any feature of Buddhist\r\narchitecture. More than this, there is no trace of Buddha, of any scene\r\nfrom his life, or from the jatakas to be found among the sculptures. In\r\nformer days it might be excusable to doubt this; but it is not so now\r\nthat any man may make himself familiar with the sculptures at Bharhut,\r\nat Sanchi, or Amravati, or with those from the Gandhara monasteries or\r\nat Boro Buddor. It is just as easy to recognise a Buddhist scene or\r\nlegend in these representations, as it is to identify a Christian scene\r\nin the Arena chapel at Padua, or at Monreale near Palermo. What may\r\nhereafter turn up I do not know, but meanwhile I most unhesitatingly\r\nassert that there is not a trace of Buddhism in any of the bas-reliefs\r\nyet brought to light from Nakhon Wat, nor an integral statue of Buddha\r\nor of any Buddhist saint about the place.\r\n\r\nI am, of course, aware that there are traditions of Asoka having sent\r\nmissionaries there, and of Buddhaghosha having visited the place,[645]\r\nbut they are the merest of traditions, imported, apparently, from Siam,\r\nand resting on no authenticated basis. Had Buddhists ever come here _en\r\nmasse_, or the country ever been converted to that religion, as was the\r\ncase in Java, it seems impossible the fact should not be observable in\r\nthe buildings. But there seems no trace of it there. There is no Eastern\r\ncountry, in fact, where that religion seems to have been so little known\r\nin ancient times. The testimony of the Chinese traveller, who visited\r\nthe country in A.D. 1295,[646] is sufficient to prove it did exist in\r\nhis time; but, like his predecessors Fa Hian and Hiouen Thsang, he saw\r\nhis own faith everywhere, and, with true Chinese superciliousness, saw\r\nno other religion anywhere.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be at present ascertained, it seems as if the migrations\r\nof the Indians to Java and to Cambodia took place about the same time\r\nand from the same quarter; but with this remarkable difference: they\r\nwent _en masse_ to Java, and found a _tabula rasa_--a people, it may be,\r\nnumerous, but without arts or religion, and they implanted there their\r\nown with very slight modifications. In Cambodia the country must have\r\nbeen more civilized, and had a religion, if not an art. The Indians seem\r\nslowly, and only to a limited extent, to have been able to modify their\r\nreligion towards Hinduism, probably because it was identical, or at\r\nleast sympathetic; but they certainly endowed the Cambodians with an art\r\nwhich we have no reason to suppose they before possessed. Now that we\r\nknow to what an extent classical art prevailed in the country these\r\nIndians are reputed to have come from, and to how late a date that art\r\ncontinued to be practised in the north-west, we are no longer puzzled to\r\nunderstand the prevalence of classical details in this temple; but to\r\nwork out the connexion in all its variations is one of the most\r\ninteresting problems that remain to exercise the ingenuity of future\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAION.\r\n\r\nThere is a temple within the city walls which, when as well known, may\r\nprove to be a grander and more splendid temple than Nakhon Wat itself.\r\nWhen Mr. Thomson visited the place, it was so overgrown with jungle that\r\nhe could not make out its plan or even count its towers. Garnier could\r\nonly form a diagram of its plan (plate 21), but he gave two views--one a\r\nwoodcut in the text (page 67), the other a lithograph in his atlas. It\r\nis understood, however, that M. Delaporte has cleared out the place, and\r\nmade careful plans and drawings of the whole, so that in a short time we\r\nmay expect to know all about it. It is a rectangle, measuring about 400\r\nft. by 433 ft., and its general appearance may be gathered by imagining\r\nthe effect of Nakhon Wat with fifty-two towers instead of nine, and the\r\nwhole perhaps more richly and elaborately ornamented than even that\r\ntemple. It certainly appears to be older--probably it belongs to the\r\n11th or 12th century; and its sculptures are consequently better in\r\nexecution, though whether they are equal in design we have yet to learn.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature in the design is, that each of the towers is\r\nadorned by four great masks. One of the smaller of these is shown in the\r\nnext woodcut (No. 378), and gives an idea of the style of their\r\ndecorations, but cannot of the larger towers, nor of the effect of a\r\ngreat number of them grouped together, and dominated by one in the\r\ncentre 60 ft. in diameter, and of proportionate height.\r\n\r\nThe question still remains, to what deity, or for what form of worship,\r\nwas this strange temple erected? We know of nothing like it elsewhere.\r\nIt certainly is not Buddhist, nor Jaina, nor, so far as known, is it\r\nHindu. Neither Siva nor Vishnu, nor any of the familiar gods of that\r\nPantheon, appear anywhere. It may turn out to be otherwise, but at\r\npresent there seems no escape from the hypothesis that it was dedicated\r\nto Brahma. We have no temple belonging to this god in India Proper, but\r\nhe does appear with the other two in sculptures at Hullabîd, and in\r\nother places, completing the trinity. His images are found much more\r\nfrequently in Java than in India, though I am not aware that any temple\r\nhas yet been found in the island dedicated to him. In Cambodia, however,\r\nhe plays a most important part in all the local traditions. When, for\r\ninstance, the sovereign who married the Snake-king’s daughter got tired\r\nof his father-in-law, he set up an image of the four-faced Brahma over\r\nthe gates of the city, which so terrified the old man that he fled to\r\nhis dark abode cursing his ungrateful children. Such an image does still\r\nexist over the principal gate of the city; but the Chinese traveller,\r\nwho visited the place in 1295,[647] calls it a five-faced image of\r\nBuddha! The traveller was a Buddhist, and, as before mentioned, saw his\r\nown religion everywhere, and that only in every temple and in every\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 378. One of the Towers of the Temple at Ongcor Thom.\r\n(From a Photograph by Mr. J. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nAll the traditions collected by Bastian, and the numerous images of Ta\r\nPhrohm or Brahma found by the French at Mount Kromi and elsewhere, fully\r\nbear out this assignment of the temple to Brahma. But if it should\r\neventually prove to be correct, what a wide door it opens for\r\nspeculation, and what a flood of light it would throw on many questions\r\nthat are now perplexing us. Is it that a worship of Brahma really\r\nexisted in the north-west, in the original seats of the immigrant races\r\nbefore they passed into India, and that it was left to vegetate there\r\nwhile the settlers adopted the more fashionable religious of Siva and\r\nVishnu in the countries of their adoption? If this were so, a later\r\nmigration may have taken place by a northern route through Yunan, taking\r\nwith them the older form of the faith and planting it in this far-off\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt was not by accident that the knowledge either of Brahma or of these\r\nstrangely classical forms of art were imported into this country. We\r\ncannot yet explain how all this happened, but we see enough to feel sure\r\nthat in a very few years the solution will be possible--perhaps easy. It\r\nwould indeed be a triumph if we could track Brahma back to the cave\r\nwhere he has been so long hidden, and connect his worship with some of\r\nthe known religions of the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRather more than a mile to the eastward of the city is another\r\nfirst-class temple, called Ta Proum, or Paten ta Phrohm, the residence\r\nof Phrohm or Brahma.[648] It is a square, measuring about 400 ft. each\r\nway, and, so far as can be made out from M. Mouhot’s plan, was of the\r\nsame class as Nakhon Wat; but, as Lieutenant Garnier says, it is so\r\nruined that its plan can hardly be made out,[649] and it is so choked\r\nwith vegetation, that in a few years not one stone of it will remain\r\nupon another.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles further eastward is another temple of the same class,\r\nbut much more perfect, called Melea, and at seventy miles a third,\r\ncalled Preacan. These were only imperfectly explored by the first French\r\nexpedition, but have been thoroughly investigated by the second,[650]\r\nand we may hope soon to have plans and all the details necessary to\r\nenable us to speak with confidence with regard to this curious but most\r\ninteresting group of temples. They are evidently very numerous, and all\r\nmost elaborately adorned, and, it need hardly be added, very unlike\r\nanything we have met with in any part of India described in the previous\r\nchapters of this work. They certainly are neither Buddhist, Jaina, nor\r\nHindu, in any sense in which we have hitherto understood these terms,\r\nand they as certainly are not residences or buildings used for any civil\r\npurposes. It is possible that, when we become acquainted with the\r\nancient architecture of Yunan, or the provinces of Central and Western\r\nChina, we may get some hints as to their origin. At present I am\r\ninclined to look further north and further west for the solution of the\r\nriddle; but, till we are in possession of the results of the French\r\nexpedition, it is premature to speculate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese great galleried temples may be considered as the most typical, as\r\nthey certainly are the most magnificent, of the temples of the\r\nCambodians; but, besides these, there are ten or twelve great temples in\r\nOngcor Thom and its neighbourhood, which anywhere else would be\r\nconsidered worthy of attention. Of these, one at Mount Bakeng, to the\r\nsouth of the city, is a five-storeyed pyramid, with sixty small\r\npavilions on its steps, and a platform on its summit, which is now only\r\nencumbered with some débris; but whether they are the remains of a\r\nSikra, or whether it was a well-temple like those in Java, is by no\r\nmeans clear.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the city is another somewhat similar--a pyramid, with\r\nthree storeys, rising to a height of about 50 ft. It, however, is\r\nenclosed in a gallery, measuring 250 ft. each way, and seems to have had\r\nfive pavilions on its summit.[651]\r\n\r\nThe other temples are not of such magnificence as to justify their being\r\ndescribed here; their interest would be great in a monograph of the\r\nstyle, but, without illustrations, their dimensions, coupled with their\r\nunfamiliar names, would convey very little information to the\r\nreader.[652]\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nThe palaces and public buildings of Ongcor seem to be quite worthy of\r\nits temples, either as regards extent or richness of decoration. They\r\nare, however, as might be expected, in a more ruinous state; being less\r\nmonumental in their mode of construction, and, what is more to our\r\npresent purpose, they have neither been drawn nor photographed to such\r\nan extent as to render them intelligible.\r\n\r\nA view of one of the gates of Ongcor Thom is given by Lieutenant\r\nGarnier, Plate 8; and as it is as remarkable as anything about the\r\nplace, it is to be hoped that full details will be brought home by the\r\npresent expedition. Fortunately, it is the gateway described by the\r\nChinese visitor, in 1295,[653] as at the end of the great bridge, which\r\nwas, and is, adorned by fifty-two giants, bearing on their arms the\r\ngreat seven-headed Naga that formed the parapet of the bridge.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the gate are three elephants, and on each angle the head\r\nof a great seven-headed Naga. Above these are figures of men and women,\r\nbut the great feature is the four-faced mask of Brahma, as on the spires\r\nof the Baion (Woodcut No. 378). The details of the upper part also so\r\nfar resemble those of that temple that they must be nearly the same age.\r\nThis, therefore, cannot well be the four-faced figure of Brahma, which\r\nhis ungrateful children set up to frighten their parent when they were\r\ntired of him (_ante_, page 680); but it is curious to find the legend\r\nrepeated in stone and standing at this day. It may, however, be that the\r\nstone gave rise to the legend; but, whichever way it arose, it is\r\nequally interesting as material evidences of a history and of a religion\r\nof which, up to this time, we know little or nothing.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the cities were also of very great extent, and of\r\ndimensions commensurate with their importance. They seem generally to\r\nhave been constructed of a coarse ferruginous stone in large blocks, and\r\nonly the gates and ornamental parts were of the fine-grained sandstone\r\nof which the temples and palaces are built. Wonderful as these temples\r\nand palaces are, the circumstance that, perhaps, after all gives the\r\nhighest idea of the civilization of these ancient Cambodians is the\r\nperfection of their roads and bridges. One great trunk road seems to\r\nhave stretched for 300 miles across the country from Korat, in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction, to the Mekong river. It was a raised causeway,\r\npaved throughout like a Roman road, and every stream that it crossed was\r\nspanned by a bridge, many of which remain perfect to the present day.\r\nDr. Bastian describes two of these: one, 400 ft. in length, and 50 ft.\r\nin breadth, richly ornamented by balustrades and cornices, and\r\nrepresentations of snakes and the Snake king.[654] The extraordinary\r\nthing is, that it is constructed without radiating arches, but like\r\nevery structure in the place, by a system of bracketing or horizontal\r\narches, and without cement. Yet it has withstood, for five centuries at\r\nleast, the violence of the tropical torrent which it spans.\r\n\r\nEven if no vestiges of these roads or bridges remained, the sculptures\r\nof Nakhon Wat are sufficient to prove the state of perfection which the\r\nart of transport had reached in this community. In these there are\r\nnumerous representations of chariots, all with wheels from 3 ft. to 5\r\nft. in height, and with sixteen spokes, which must be of metal, for no\r\nLondon coachmaker at the present day could frame anything so delicate in\r\nwood. The rims, too, are in metal, and, apparently, the wheel turns on\r\nthe axle. Those who are aware how difficult a problem it is to make a\r\nperfect wheel will appreciate how much is involved in such a perfect\r\nsolution of the problem as is here found. But it requires a knowledge of\r\nthe clumsiness of the Romans and our mediæval forefathers in this\r\nrespect, and the utter barbarism of the wheels represented in Indian\r\nsculptures and still used in India, to feel fully its importance as an\r\nindex of high civilization.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Cambodians were the only people who before the 13th\r\ncentury made such wheels as these, it is also probably true that their\r\narchitects were the only ones who had sufficient mechanical skill to\r\nconstruct their roofs wholly of hewn stone, without the aid either of\r\nwood or concrete, and who could dovetail and join them so beautifully\r\nthat they remain watertight and perfect after five centuries of neglect\r\nin a tropical climate. Nothing can exceed the skill and ingenuity with\r\nwhich the stones of the roofs are joggled and fitted into one another,\r\nunless it is the skill with which the joints of their plain walls are so\r\npolished and so evenly laid without cement of any kind. It is difficult\r\nto detect their joints even in a sun-picture, which generally reveals\r\nflaws not to be detected by the eye. Except in the works of the old\r\npyramid-building Egyptians, I know of nothing to compare with it.\r\n\r\nWhen we put all these things together, it is difficult to decide whether\r\nwe ought most to admire the mechanical skill which the Cambodian\r\narchitects displayed in construction or the largeness of conception and\r\nartistic merit which pervades every part of their designs. These alone\r\nought to be more than sufficient to recommend their study to every\r\narchitect. To the historian of art the wonder is to find temples with\r\nsuch a singular combination of styles in such a locality--Indian temples\r\nconstructed with pillars almost purely classical in design, and\r\nornamented with bas-reliefs so strangely Egyptian in character. To the\r\nethnologist they are almost equally interesting, in consequence of the\r\nreligion to which they are dedicated. Taken together, these\r\ncircumstances render their complete investigation so important that it\r\nis hoped it will not now be long delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nCHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nPeriod of Hea                                     B.C.  2100\r\nWoo Wong period of Chow                                 1100\r\nConfucius died                                           477\r\nChy hoang-ty built Great Wall                            240\r\nHan dynasty                                              201\r\nHoty, seventeenth king; Buddhism introduced       A.D.    90\r\nTsin dynasty                                             260\r\nWootae dynasty; China divided into two kingdoms          416\r\nChina reunited, capital Honan                            585\r\nTang dynasty                                             897\r\nNorthern China conquered by Mongols                     1234\r\nKublai Khan                                             1281\r\nMing dynasty; Mongol expelled                           1366\r\nManchow Tartar dynasty; now on the throne               1644\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to\r\nwrite anything, either conclusive or satisfactory, about the\r\narchitecture of China. This may arise partly from the incuriousness of\r\ntravellers, and partly because there really are no buildings in the\r\ncountry worthy of the people or their civilization. Till very recently,\r\nthe latter would have appeared to be the true cause of our ignorance;\r\nbut lately the photographic camera has penetrated even within the walls\r\nof the imperial city of Pekin, and has brought away impressions which go\r\nsome way to modify this opinion. Unfortunately, the camera has not been\r\naccompanied by the measuring-tape or the notebook, and our information\r\nis therefore, in some respects, vague; but it seems certain that there\r\nare buildings worthy of more attention than has hitherto been bestowed\r\nupon them. Even these, however, are not such as we might expect to find\r\namong a people whose history and whose civilization seems so exact a\r\ncounterpart of that of Egypt. In both countries we have the same long\r\nsuccession of dynasties with dates, extending through 3000 or 4000\r\nyears, interrupted only by shepherd invasions which in both countries\r\nlasted about five centuries, when the words of Manetho are as literally\r\napplicable to the Taeping rebellion as they are to the overthrow of the\r\nHyksos by the uprising of the native Egyptian races. During all this\r\nlong period the same patriarchal form of government prevailed in both\r\ncountries--the king being not only the head of the secular government,\r\nbut the chief priest of the people. Both people early attained a certain\r\nstage of civilization, and maintained it without change or progress\r\nduring the whole period of their existence. The syllabic symbols of the\r\nChinese are the exact counterpart of the hieroglyphic writing of the\r\nEgyptians, as clumsy and as unlike that of any other contemporary\r\nnation, and as symbolic of their exclusive segregation from the rest of\r\nmankind. In both countries there was always the same calm contemplation\r\nof death, the same desire for an honourable funeral and a splendid tomb,\r\nand the same reverence for the dead. In these and fifty other\r\nparticulars, the manners and customs of the two peoples seem identical,\r\nand the perfect parallelism only breaks down when we come to speak of\r\ntheir buildings. There are no tombs in China to be compared with the\r\nPyramids, and no temples that approach those of Thebes in dimensions or\r\nin splendour.\r\n\r\nIf the Chinese were as closely allied to the Tartar or Mongolian tribes\r\non their north-eastern frontier as is generally supposed, this\r\ndifference could not have existed. It may therefore be, as has been\r\nsuspected, that the true Chinese are more closely allied to the\r\nPolynesian races, especially on the sea-board, which is the only part of\r\nthe country we are really acquainted with. When the inner country has\r\nbeen more carefully examined, it is probable that we may see cause to\r\nmodify our opinion as to the architectural character of the Chinese\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis will be especially the case if, as is highly probable, the\r\nso-called Indo-Chinese inhabitants of Cambodia are very much more\r\nclosely allied in blood to the Chinese than they are to any of the races\r\ninhabiting India; since, by the erection of the buildings described in\r\nthe last division of this work, the Cambodians have nobly vindicated\r\ntheir title to be considered as one of the great building races of the\r\nworld. Considering the short time of their existence and the limited\r\narea they occupied, they may in fact lay claim to having surpassed even\r\nthe Egyptians in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt will be strange if in Honan and Quang-si we do not eventually find\r\nthe links which will confirm the connexion of the two races of Cambodia\r\nand China, and explain what at present can only be regarded as one of\r\nthe unsolved problems of architectural history.\r\n\r\nA little well-directed industry on the spot would very soon clear all\r\nthis doubt away. Meanwhile there are other minor causes which may have\r\ncontributed to the absence of monumental buildings in China, and which\r\nit may be as well to allude to before proceeding further. In the first\r\nplace, the Chinese never had either a dominant priesthood or a\r\nhereditary nobility. The absence of the former class is a very important\r\nconsideration, because, in all countries where architecture has been\r\ncarried to anything like perfection, it is to sacred art that it has\r\nowed its highest inspiration, and sacred art is never so strongly\r\ndeveloped as under the influence of a powerful and splendid hierarchy.\r\nAgain, religious and sectarian zeal is often a strong stimulus to sacred\r\narchitecture, and this is entirely wanting in this remarkable people.\r\nThough the Chinese are bigoted to a greater extent than we can well\r\nconceive in all political matters, they are more tolerant than any other\r\nnation we know of in all that concerns religion. At the present moment\r\nthree great religious sects divide the empire nearly equally between\r\nthem. For though Buddhism is the religion of the reigning family, and\r\nperhaps numbers more followers than either of the other two, still the\r\nfollowers of the doctrines of Confucius--the contemporary and rival of\r\nSakya Sinha--are a more purely Chinese sect than the other, and hold an\r\nequal place in public estimation; while, at the present time, the sect\r\nof Laou Tse, or the Doctors of Reason, is more fashionable, and\r\ncertainly more progressive, than the others.[655] Christianity, too,\r\nmight at one time have encroached largely on either of these, and become\r\na very prevalent religion in this tolerant empire, had the Jesuits and\r\nDominicans understood that the condition of religious tolerance here is\r\na total abstinence from interference in political matters. This,\r\nhowever, the Roman Catholic priesthood never could be brought to\r\nunderstand; hence their expulsion from the realm, and the proscription\r\nof their faith, which otherwise would not only have been tolerated like\r\nall others, but bid fair to find more extensive favour than any. Such\r\ntoleration is highly laudable in one point of view; but the want of\r\nfervour and energy from which it arises is fatal to any great exertions\r\nfor the honour of religion.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the want of an hereditary nobility, and indeed of any\r\nstrong family pride, is equally unfavourable to domestic architecture of\r\na durable description. At a man’s death his property is generally\r\ndivided equally among his children. Consequently the wealthiest men do\r\nnot build residences calculated to last longer than their own lives. The\r\nroyal palaces are merely somewhat larger and more splendid than those\r\nof the mandarins, but the same in character, and erected with the same\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThere is no country where property has hitherto been considered so\r\nsecure as China. Private feuds and private wars were till lately\r\nunknown; foreign invasion was practically impossible, and little\r\ndreaded. Hence they have none of those fortalices, or fortified\r\nmansions, which by their mass and solidity give such a marked character\r\nto a certain class of domestic edifices in the western world. Equality,\r\npeace, and toleration, are blessings whose value it would be difficult\r\nto overestimate; but on the dead though pleasing level where they exist,\r\nit is in vain to look for the rugged sublimity of the mountain, or the\r\nterrific grandeur of the storm. The Chinese have chosen the humbler path\r\nof life, and with singular success. There is not perhaps a more\r\nindustrious or, till the late wars, happier people on the face of the\r\nglobe; but they are at the same time singularly deficient in every\r\nelement of greatness, either political or artistic.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, it certainly is curious to find the oldest\r\ncivilized people now existing on the face of the globe almost wholly\r\nwithout monuments to record the past, or any desire to convey to\r\nposterity a worthy idea of their present greatness. It is no less\r\nremarkable to find the most populous of nations, a nation in which\r\nmillions are always seeking employment, never thinking of any of those\r\nhigher modes of expression which would serve as a means of multiplying\r\noccupation, and which elevate while feeding the masses; and still more\r\nstartling to find wealth, such as the Chinese possess, never invested in\r\nself-glorification, by individuals erecting for themselves monuments\r\nwhich shall astonish their contemporaries, and hand down their names to\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes it may be that Chinese architecture is not worthy of\r\nmuch attention. In one respect, however, it is instructive, since the\r\nChinese are the only people who now employ polychromy as an essential\r\npart of their architecture: indeed, with them, colour is far more\r\nessential than form; and certainly the result is so far pleasing and\r\nsatisfactory, that for the lower grades of art it is hardly doubtful\r\nthat it should always be so. For the higher grades, however, it is\r\nhardly less certain that colour, though most valuable as an accessary,\r\nis incapable of that lofty power of expression which form conveys to the\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPAGODAS.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nTemple of the Great Dragon--Buddhist\r\nTemples--Taas--Tombs--Pailoos--Domestic Architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we had the requisite knowledge, or if the known examples of Chinese\r\ntemples were sufficiently numerous, we ought, before describing them, to\r\nclassify the buildings, apportioning each to that one of the three\r\nreligions to which it belongs. For the present this must be left to some\r\none on the spot. Meanwhile there is no difficulty in recognising those\r\nwhich belong to the religion of Fo or Buddha. These are generally the\r\nnine-storeyed towers or taas, which, as will be explained hereafter, are\r\nmerely exaggerated tees of the Indian dagobas. The temples, properly\r\nso-called, of this religion, are not very magnificent, nor are they\r\ngenerally built in a permanent style of architecture. This is still more\r\nthe case, apparently, with the temples of Confucius. The only one that\r\nhas been carefully described and photographed is that at Pekin, which is\r\nalso probably the most magnificent. Judging from our present\r\ninformation, it more resembles a university than a temple. There are\r\nneither images nor altars, but great halls, on which are hung up the\r\nnames of the emperors and of the most distinguished literates of the\r\nkingdom. There are no priests; and though ceremonies are there performed\r\nannually by the emperor in honour of the great philosopher, these\r\nscarcely can be called worship, or the hall a temple.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE OF THE GREAT DRAGON.\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent temple in the capital, so far as we know in the\r\nempire, is that known as the Temple of Heaven, or the Great Dragon.[656]\r\nIt is situated close to the southern wall of the city in a square\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 379. Temple of the Great Dragon. (From a Photograph by\r\nBeato.)]\r\n\r\nenclosure measuring about a mile each way. From the outer gate a raised\r\ncauseway leads to the temple, on either side of which are numerous\r\nbuildings for the accommodation of the priests, which are approached by\r\nfrequent flights of steps leading down to a park beautifully planted. At\r\nits inner extremity stands the temple itself, a circular building, three\r\nstoreys in height, with broad projecting roofs, the upper terminating in\r\na gilt ball, directly under which stands the altar.\r\n\r\nThe temple is raised on a circular pyramid, the three terraces of which\r\nare seen in the woodcut. There are several handsome gateways at\r\nintervals across the causeway, so arranged that from the entrance the\r\ncircular temple itself can be seen through the long vista, framed as it\r\nwere by them; and as the whole of the upper part is covered with blue\r\ntiles and gilding, the effect is said to be very pleasing.\r\n\r\nIn the same enclosure is another temple called that of the Earth, where\r\nsacrifices of animals are annually offered to the gods, whoever they may\r\nbe, to whom this temple is dedicated.\r\n\r\nThese temples are said to have been erected about the year 1420, and, if\r\nso old, seem to be in a very fair state of preservation, considering the\r\nmanner in which they are now neglected.\r\n\r\nIn reading Mr. Michie’s, or any other description of the Dragon Temple\r\nof Pekin, it seems impossible to avoid feeling that there are so many\r\npoints of resemblance between it and the Serpent Temple of Nakhon Wat,\r\nthat the coincidence can hardly be accidental. The variations are hardly\r\ngreater than might be expected from difference of age, and the fact that\r\nthe one was erected by Chinese at the northern extremity of their\r\nempire, the other by Cambodians near the southern limit of theirs. All\r\nthe links, however, which connect the two temples are still wanting;\r\nyet, as we have the assertion of the Chinese traveller in 1295 that the\r\nTao-tze religion[657] existed in Cambodia while he was there, we should\r\nnot feel surprise at any similarity that may be traced between the\r\ntemples of the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDDHIST TEMPLES.\r\n\r\nThe only Buddhist temple in China of which any plans have been made, or\r\nwhich I have myself had an opportunity of inspecting, is that at Honan,\r\nopposite Canton. Unfortunately it is very modern, and by no means\r\nmonumental. It is a parallelogram enclosed by a high wall, measuring 306\r\nft. by 174 ft. In the shorter front facing the river is a gateway of\r\nsome pretension. This leads to a series of halls opening into each\r\nother, and occupying the whole of the longer axis of the internal court.\r\nThe first and second of these are porches or antechapels. The central\r\none is the largest, and practically the choir of the building. It\r\ncontains the altar, adorned by gilt images of the three precious\r\nBuddhas, with stalls for the monks and all arrangements necessary for\r\nthe daily service. Behind this, in the next compartment, is a dagoba,\r\nand in its rear another apartment devoted to the goddess Kuan yin,\r\nprincipally worshipped by women--in fact, the Lady Chapel of the church.\r\nAround the court are arranged the cells of the monks, their kitchen,\r\nrefectory, and all the necessary offices of the convent. These are\r\ngenerally placed against the outer wall, and open into the court.\r\n\r\nAny person familiar with the rock-cut examples in India will easily\r\nrecognise in this temple all the features he is accustomed to in the\r\nearlier Chaityas and Viharas, though strangely altered by their Chinese\r\ndisguise. The figure which stood in front of the dagoba (Woodcut No. 61)\r\nis moved forward and placed on an altar by itself, with two companions\r\nadded, in accordance with modern Chinese theology; but the general\r\narrangements remain the same. The most interesting part, however, is the\r\narrangement of the cells, &c., relatively to the temple. In one of the\r\ncaves at Dhumnar (Bhim ka Bazar) something like this has been attempted,\r\nbut it is evidently so difficult of execution in the rock, that we are\r\nnot surprised to find it not repeated. It is evidently what was intended\r\nto be represented on the central rath of Mahavellipore (Woodcut No.\r\n181), and must indeed have been the general arrangement of Buddhist\r\necclesiastical establishments. What is now wanted is, that some one\r\nshould supply information regarding the earlier temples of the Chinese,\r\nsay of the 12th to the 16th centuries. They no doubt exist, and would\r\nthrow great light on the earlier Indian examples. In the meanwhile,\r\nhowever, it is curious to refer back to the Woodcut No. 129. From it it\r\nwill be perceived that as early as the 11th century the Buddhist Chaitya\r\nin India, standing in the centre of its Vihara, had already been\r\nsublimated into an idol temple, surrounded by a series of idol niches,\r\nsince there cannot be a doubt that the Jaina temple of Vimala Sah is a\r\nreproduction for another purpose of an old Buddhist monastery. The\r\ncurious point is, that the 18th-century temple of Honan reproduces, for\r\ntheir original purpose, forms which in India had, seven centuries\r\nearlier, passed away to another faith, and became wholly conventional.\r\nIt is still more strange that, if we leap over the intermediate period,\r\nand go seven centuries further back, we shall find in India the same\r\nceremonies performed in the same form of temples as those at which any\r\none may assist in China at the present day.\r\n\r\nAt Pekin there are several Lamaseries or Buddhist monasteries, of a much\r\nmore monumental character than that at Honan, but it is very difficult\r\nindeed to guess at their arrangement from mere verbal descriptions\r\nwithout dimensions. The gateway of one, represented in Woodcut No. 380,\r\ngives a fair idea of the usual mode of constructing gateways in China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 380. Monumental Gateway of Buddhist Monastery, Pekin.\r\n(From a Photograph by Beato.)]\r\n\r\nIt has three openings of pleasing proportions, and is as well designed\r\nas any to be found in China. Behind it is to be seen the dagoba, to\r\nwhich it leads: a tall form, with a reverse slope, and an exaggerated\r\ntee, so altered from those we are accustomed to in the earlier days of\r\nIndian architecture, that it requires some familiarity with the\r\nintermediate forms in Nepal and Burmah to feel sure that it is the\r\ndirect lineal descendant of the topes at Sanchi or Manikyala. Around it\r\nare minarets, with a cross-legged seated figure of Buddha on each face.\r\nBut without a plan or description it is impossible to say whether they\r\ncome down to the ground, or on what kind of basement they rest.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary form of a temple, as seen in the villages or towns in\r\nChina, is extremely simple, and seems to be the same, whether dedicated\r\nto Buddha, or to the Queen of Heaven, or to any other deity of the\r\nstrange pantheon of the Celestial Empire. It generally consists of a\r\nsquare apartment with a highly ornamented roof, and with one of the\r\nside-walls removed. The entrance is never at the end, nor the end wall\r\never removed, as would be the case in the West, but always the side; and\r\nit is by no means clear that this is not the right and reasonable way of\r\narranging matters. In very small temples a single beam supports the\r\neaves, and a screen inside forms the back of the porch and the front of\r\nthe temple. In larger temples two or more pillars are introduced, but\r\nthe other arrangements remain the same. Both these may be seen in the\r\nannexed woodcut (No. 381), and when arranged as picturesquely as in this\r\ngroup, and with their gateways and subsidiary adjuncts, they become very\r\npleasing features in the landscape. As architectural objects, they\r\ndepend for their effect principally on colour, which is applied with an\r\nunsparing hand in the form of glazed tiles, painted ornaments, and\r\nfrequently also paintings, such as landscapes and figure subjects.\r\nGilding is also employed to a great extent, and with good effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 381. Temple at Macao. (From a Sketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTAAS.\r\n\r\nThe objects of Chinese architecture with which the European eye is most\r\nfamiliar are the taas, or nine-storeyed pagodas, as they are usually\r\ncalled. In the south they generally have that number of storeys, but not\r\nalways, and in the north it ranges from three to thirteen. As before\r\nhinted, these are nothing but exaggerated tees of dagobas, and it is\r\neasy to trace them through all the stages of the change. In India we can\r\neasily trace the single wooden chattah or umbrella of Karli (Woodcut No.\r\n56) to the nine-storeyed tower at Chittore (Woodcut No. 143), and from\r\nthat the transition is easy to the Chinese examples, although the\r\nelaboration of the two was simultaneous, and the Chinese had probably\r\nerected tall towers as early as the Jains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 382. Porcelain Tower, Nankin.]\r\n\r\nOf those which existed in China in our own time the best known is the\r\ncelebrated porcelain tower at Nankin.[658] Commenced in the year 1412,\r\nand finished in 1431, it was erected as a monument of gratitude to an\r\nempress of the Ming family, and was, in consequence, generally called\r\nthe Temple of Gratitude. It was octagonal in form, 236 ft. in height, of\r\nwhich, however, about 30 ft. must be deducted for the iron spire that\r\nsurmounted it, leaving little more than 200 ft. for the elevation of the\r\nbuilding, or about the height of the Monument of London. From the summit\r\nof the spire eight chains depended, to each of which were attached nine\r\nbells, and a bell was also attached to each angle of the lower roofs,\r\nmaking 144 bells in all, which, when tinkling in harmony to the evening\r\nbreeze, must have produced an effect as singular as pleasing. It was\r\nnot, however, either to its dimensions or its bells that the tower owed\r\nits celebrity, but to the coating of porcelain which clothed its brick\r\nwalls, as well as the upper and under sides of the projecting roofs,\r\nwhich mark the division of each storey. The porcelain produced a\r\nbrilliancy of effect which is totally lost in all the representations of\r\nit yet published, but which was, in fact, that on which the architect\r\nalmost wholly relied for producing the effect he desired, and without\r\nwhich his design is a mere skeleton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 383. Pagoda in Summer Palace, Pekin. (From a Photograph\r\nby Beato.)]\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated pagoda is that known as “Second Bar Pagoda,” on the\r\nCanton river. It is a pillar of victory, erected to commemorate a naval\r\nbattle which the Chinese claim to have gained near the spot. It is, in\r\ndesign, nearly identical with that of Nankin, but of smaller dimensions,\r\nand is now fast falling to ruin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 384. Tung Chow Pagoda. (From a Photograph by Beato.)]\r\n\r\nThese two are of the usual and most typical form, and so like hundreds\r\nof others, that it is impossible to deduce any sequence from them with\r\nsuch representations as we now possess. Though pleasing and purposelike,\r\nas well as original, they are somewhat monotonous in design. A tower\r\ndivided into nine equal and similar storeys is a very inferior design to\r\nthat of the minars of the Mahomedans, or the ordinary spires of\r\nChristian churches; and, if all were like these, we should be forced to\r\ndeny the Chinese the faculty of invention in architecture. In the north,\r\nhowever, the forms seem much more various. One in the Summer Palace\r\n(Woodcut No. 383) is divided into either three or seven storeys, as you\r\nchoose to count them. Four of the sides of the octagon are longer than\r\nthe other four, and altogether there is a play of light and shade, and a\r\nvariety about the ornaments in this tower, which is extremely pleasing.\r\nIt is much more like an Indian design than any other known in China, and\r\nwith the circle of pillars round its base, and the Lât or Stambha, which\r\nusually accompany these objects further west, it recalls the original\r\nforms as completely as any other object in this country.\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to this is the Pagoda of Tung Chow (Woodcut No. 384).\r\nIts thirteen storeys are almost more monotonous than those of the Nankin\r\nPagoda; but they are merely architectural ornaments, string-courses, in\r\nfact; and as the tower is not pierced with windows above the base, it\r\nbecomes, like an Orissan temple, an imposing object of architectural art\r\nwithout any apparent utilitarian object. It thus escapes the charge of\r\nlittleness in design, which only too justly applies to most of its\r\ncompeers.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to form a correct estimate of the artistic\r\nmerits of these towers. Edifices so original and so national must be\r\ninteresting from that circumstance alone, and it seems almost impossible\r\nto build anything in a tower-like form of great height, whether as a\r\nsteeple, a minar, or a pagoda, which shall not form a pleasing object\r\nfrom its salience and aspiring character alone, even without any real\r\nartistic merit in itself. Besides these qualifications, I cannot but\r\nthink that the tapering octagonal form, the boldly-marked divisions, the\r\ndomical roof, and general consistence in design and ornament of these\r\ntowers, entitle them to rank tolerably high among the tower-like\r\nbuildings of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMBS.\r\n\r\nLike all people of Tartar origin, one of the most remarkable\r\ncharacteristics of the Chinese is their reverence for the dead, or as it\r\nis usually called, their ancestral worship. In consequence of this,\r\ntheir tombs are not only objects of care, but have frequently more\r\nornament bestowed upon them than graces the dwellings of the living.\r\n\r\nTheir tombs are of different kinds; often merely conical mounds of\r\nearth, with a circle of stones round their base, like those of the\r\nEtruscans or ancient Greeks, as may be seen from the woodcut (No. 385)\r\nborrowed from Fortune’s ‘China’--which would serve equally well for a\r\nrestoration of those of Tarquinia or Vulci. More generally they are of a\r\nhemispherical shape, surmounted with a spire, not unlike the Indian and\r\nCeylonese examples, but still with a physiognomy peculiarly Chinese. The\r\nmost common arrangement is that of a horseshoe-shaped platform, cut out\r\nof the side of a hill. It consequently has a high back, in which is the\r\nentrance to the tomb, and slopes off to nothing at the entrance to the\r\nhorseshoe, where the wall generally terminates with two lions or\r\ndragons, or some fantastic ornament common to Chinese architecture. When\r\nthe tomb is situated, as is generally the case, on a hillside, this\r\narrangement is not only appropriate, but elegant. When the same thing is\r\nimitated on a plain, it is singularly misplaced and unintelligible. Many\r\nof the tombs are built of granite, finely polished, and carved with a\r\nprofusion of labour that makes us regret that the people who can employ\r\nthe most durable materials with such facility should have so great a\r\npredilection for ephemeral wooden structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 385. Chinese Grave. (From Fortune’s ‘Wanderings in\r\nChina.’)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 386. Chinese Tomb. (From Fortune’s ‘Wanderings in\r\nChina.’)]\r\n\r\nWhen the rock is suitable for the purpose, which, however, seems to be\r\nrarely the case in China, their tombs are cut in the rock, as in Etruria\r\nand elsewhere; and tombs of the class just described seem to be a device\r\nfor converting an ordinary hillside into a substitute for the more\r\nappropriate situation.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, however, the Chinese do erect tombs, which, though\r\nornamental, are far from being in such good taste as the two forms just\r\nquoted. A tumulus is considered appropriate for this purpose all the\r\nworld over, and so is the horseshoe form under the circumstances in\r\nwhich the Chinese employ it; but what can be said in favour of such an\r\narray of objects as those shown in the Woodcut No. 387? Judged by the\r\nstandard of taste which prevails in China at the present day, they may\r\nbe considered by the natives as both elegant and ornamental, but it\r\nwould be difficult to conceive anything which spoke less of the\r\nsepulchre, even from a Chinaman’s point of view; while, on the other\r\nhand, their dimensions are such as to deprive them of all dignity as\r\narchitectural objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 387. Group of Tombs near Pekin. (From a Photograph by\r\nBeato.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAILOOS.\r\n\r\nThe Pailoos, or “triumphal gateways,” as they are most improperly\r\ncalled, are another class of monument almost as frequently met with in\r\nChinese scenery as the nine-storeyed pagodas, and consequently nearly as\r\nfamiliar to the European eye. Their origin is as distinctly Indian as\r\nthe other, though, from their nature, being easily overthrown, but few\r\nexamples can be found in a country that has so long ceased to be\r\nBuddhist. Fortunately, however, we still possess in the gateway of\r\nSanchi (Woodcut No. 10) the typical example of the whole class; and we\r\nfind them afterwards represented in bas-reliefs and in frescos in a\r\nmanner to leave no doubt of the frequency of their application.\r\n\r\nIn China they seem almost universally to be employed as honorific\r\nmonuments of deceased persons--either men of distinction, or widows who\r\nhave not married again, or virgins who have died unmarried. Frequently\r\nthey are still constructed in wood, and when stone is used they retain\r\nto this hour the forms and details of wooden construction. Whatever the\r\nmaterial, they consist of either two or four posts, set either on the\r\nground, so as to allow a passage through, or on a platform, as in\r\nWoodcut No. 388. This is as usual a form as the other, and shows how\r\ninapplicable the term gateway is to these monuments. The posts always\r\ncarry a rail or frieze, bearing an inscription, which is, in fact, the\r\nobject for which the monument was erected. Above this are various\r\narchitectural details, which complete the design in a manner both\r\noriginal and artistic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 388. Pailoo near Canton. (From a Sketch by the Author.)]\r\n\r\nOne serving as the portal to a dagoba has already been given (Woodcut\r\nNo. 380), and though rich, can hardly be considered as superior to that\r\nin Woodcut No. 389, which spans a street in Amoy. Instead of leading to\r\na dagoba, as was the case at Sanchi, and generally in India, we have, in\r\nthis instance, what appears to be a simulated coffin placed under a\r\ncanopy, and above the principal cornice, which is an essentially Chinese\r\nidea. With them a handsome coffin is an object of the highest ambition,\r\nand is, consequently, a luxury which the rich take care to provide\r\nthemselves with during their lifetime. So far as we know, no great\r\nstructural dagobas ever existed in China, so that their form is\r\ngenerally unfamiliar to the people.\r\n\r\nProbably the Chinese would have spent more pains on their tombs had they\r\nnot hit on the happy device of separating the monument from the\r\nsepulchre. We do so in exceptional cases, when we erect statues and\r\npillars or other monuments to our great men on hill-tops or in\r\nmarket-places; but as a rule, a man’s monument is placed where his body\r\nis laid, though it would probably be difficult to assign a good logical\r\nreason for the practice. The great peculiarity of China is that in nine\r\ncases out of ten they effect these objects by processes which are\r\nexactly the reverse of those of Europe, and in most cases it is not easy\r\nto decide which is best. In erecting the Pailoo, or monument, in a\r\nconspicuous place apart from the sepulchre, they seem to have shown\r\ntheir usual common sense, though an architect must regret that the\r\ndesigns of their tombs suffered in consequence, and have none of that\r\nmagnificence which we should expect among a people at all times so\r\naddicted to ancestral worship as the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 389. Pailoo at Amoy. (From Fisher’s ‘China\r\nIllustrated.’)]\r\n\r\nIn an historical point of view, the most curious thing connected with\r\nthese Pailoos seems to be, that at Sanchi, about the Christian Era, we\r\nfind them used as gateways to a simulated tomb. In India both the\r\ntumulus and the Pailoo had at that time passed away from their original\r\nsepulchral meaning; the one had become a relic-shrine, the other an\r\niconostasis. Two thousand years afterwards in China we find them both\r\nstill used for the purposes for which they were originally designed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nIt is in their domestic architecture, if in any, that the Chinese excel;\r\nthere we do not look either for monumental grandeur or for durability,\r\nand it is almost impossible to resist being captivated by the gaiety and\r\nbrilliancy of a Chinese dwelling of the first class, and the exuberant\r\nrichness and beauty of the carvings and ornaments that are heaped on\r\nevery part of it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable peculiarities of their houses is the almost\r\nuniversal concave form of roof, which writers on the subject have\r\ngenerally referred to as a reminiscence of the tent of the Tartars, who\r\nare supposed to have introduced it. The authors of this theory, however,\r\nforgot that the Chinese have been longer out of tents, and know less of\r\nthem, than any other people now on the face of the globe. The Tartar\r\nconquest, like our Norman one, has long been a fusion rather than a\r\nsubjection, and does not seem to have produced any visible effect on the\r\nmanners or customs of the original inhabitants of China. It may also be\r\nobserved that the typical form of the roof of a Tartar tent was and is\r\ndomical, like those represented in the Assyrian sculptures, and seldom,\r\nif ever, constructed with a hollow curve; so that the argument tells the\r\nother way. Be this as it may, the form of roof in question arose from a\r\nconstructive exigence, which others would do well to imitate. In a\r\ncountry like China, where very heavy rains fall at one season of the\r\nyear, tiled roofs, such as they almost universally use, require a high\r\npitch to carry off the water; but the glaring sunshine of another season\r\nrenders shade to walls and windows absolutely necessary. If (as on the\r\nleft of the annexed diagram) the slope of the roof is continued so far\r\nout as to be effective for the last purpose, the upper windows are too\r\nmuch darkened, and it is impossible to see out of them. To remedy this\r\ndefect, the Chinese carry out their eaves almost horizontally from the\r\nface of the walls, where a leak becomes of slight importance; and then,\r\nto break the awkward angle caused by the meeting of these two slopes,\r\nthey ease it off with a hollow curve, which not only answers the double\r\npurpose of the roof more effectually, but produces what the Chinese\r\nthink--and perhaps rightly--the most pleasing form of roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 390. Diagram of Chinese construction.]\r\n\r\nThe only parts of such a roof that admit of decoration by carving are\r\nevidently either the central or angular ridges; and here they exaggerate\r\ntheir favourite hollow curve to an extent unpleasing to a European\r\neye--the angles being, in some instances, actually turned back, and the\r\nridge being also ornamented by upturned ornaments at its ends, to an\r\nextent we cannot reconcile with our notions; nor indeed is it possible\r\nwe should, when they are overloaded with grotesque ornaments to the\r\nextent too often found.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity that gives a very local character to their\r\narchitecture is their mode of framing a roof, so unlike that of any\r\nother people. This arises from the timber most easily available for the\r\npurpose being a small pine, which has the peculiarity of being soft and\r\nspongy in the inside, while the outer rims of wood, just under the bark,\r\nretain their hardness and strength; it is thus practically a hollow\r\nwooden cylinder, which, if squared to form a framing as we do, would\r\nfall to pieces; but merely cleaned and used whole, it is a very strong\r\nand durable building-material, though one which requires all a\r\nChinaman’s ingenuity and neatness to frame together with sufficient\r\nrigidity for the purposes of a roof.\r\n\r\nThe uprights which support these roofs are generally formed of the same\r\nwood, though not unfrequently they are granite posts--they cannot be\r\ncalled pillars--of the same dimensions, and strengthened, or rather\r\nsteadied, by transverse pieces of wood, the space between which and the\r\nroof is generally filled with open-work carving, so as to form a species\r\nof frieze.\r\n\r\nThe roof is usually constructed (as shown in diagram No. 390) by using\r\nthree or four transverse pieces or tie-beams, one over the other, the\r\nends of each beam being supported on that below it by means of a framed\r\npiece of a different class of wood. By this method, though to us it may\r\nlook unscientific, they make up a framing that resists the strongest\r\nwinds uninjured. Sometimes, as shown in the dotted lines of the same\r\nwoodcut, they carry the curve across the top of the roof; but, when this\r\nis done, they are obliged to have recourse to metal roofing, or to tiles\r\nof a greater length than are usually found or easily made.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, however, it is not so much on its forms that Chinese\r\narchitecture depends as on its colours--the pillars being generally\r\npainted red, the friezes and open work green; blue marks the floors and\r\nstronger lines, and gilding is used profusely everywhere. Whether this\r\nwould improve a finer or more solid style of art may admit of doubt; but\r\nit is certainly remarkably pleasing in China, and singularly appropriate\r\nto the architecture we have been describing; and grouped as these\r\nbuildings usually are around garden courts, filled with the gayest\r\nflowers, and adorned with rock-work and fountains more fantastic than\r\nthe buildings themselves, the fancy may easily be charmed with the\r\nresult, though taste forbids us to approve of the details.\r\n\r\nThe same ephemeral system of construction which prevailed in dwellings\r\nof the rich merchants and mandarins was carried out in the royal palaces\r\nwithout any increase of monumental character, but, of course, with\r\ngreater richness of ornament, and upon a larger scale. Like most\r\nOriental palaces, however, those at Pekin consist of a number of\r\ndetached pavilions, rather than of numerous suites of apartments grouped\r\nunder one roof, as is usually the case in Europe; and they consequently\r\nnever attain the magnitude essential to architectural dignity. In the\r\nSummer Palace at Pekin there were many detached pavilions similar to\r\nthat represented in Woodcut No. 391, which, when interspersed with trees\r\nand water and rocky scenery, aid in making up a very fairy-like\r\nlandscape, but in themselves can hardly be considered as objects of\r\ndignified architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 391. Pavilion in the Summer Palace, Pekin. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Beato.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 392. Pavilion in the Summer Palace, Pekin. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Beato.)]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, however, the Chinese attempted something more monumental,\r\nbut without much success. Where glass is not available of sufficient\r\nsize and in sufficient quantities to glaze the windows, there is a\r\ndifficulty in so arranging them that the room shall not be utterly dark\r\nwhen the shutters are closed, and that the rain shall not penetrate when\r\nthey are open. In wooden construction these difficulties are much more\r\neasily avoided; deep projecting eaves, and light screens, open at the\r\ntop, obviate most of them: at least, so the Chinese always thought, and\r\nthey have consequently so little practice, that when they tried solid\r\narchitecture in a palace they could only produce such a pavilion as that\r\nfigured in Woodcut No. 392, which, though characteristic of the style,\r\ncannot be praised either for the elegance of its form or the\r\nappropriateness of its ornamentation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps their most successful efforts in this direction were when they\r\ncombined a solid basement of masonry with a light superstructure of\r\nwood, as in the Winter Palace at Pekin (Woodcut No. 393). In this\r\ninstance the height and solidity of the basement give sufficient dignity\r\nto the mass, and the light superstructure is an appropriate termination\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 393. View in the Winter Palace, Pekin. (From a\r\nPhotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThis last illustration is interesting, because it enables us to realise\r\nmore distinctly than any other example yet known, what must have been\r\nthe effect of the palaces of Nineveh and Khorsabad in the days of their\r\nsplendour. Like this palace, they were raised on a solid basement of\r\nmasonry, and were themselves composed of pavilions of light and\r\nornamental woodwork; the great difference being that they had\r\nflat-terraced roofs instead of those covered with tiles, as in snowy\r\nPekin; but the resemblance is curious, and examples even more nearly\r\nakin might probably be found if looked for.\r\n\r\nThe engineering works of the Chinese have been much extolled by some\r\nwriters, but have less claim to praise as works of science than their\r\nbuildings have as works of art. Their canals, it is true, are extensive;\r\nbut with 300 millions of inhabitants this is small praise, and their\r\nconstruction is most unscientific. Their bridges, too, are sometimes of\r\ngreat length, but generally made up of a series of small arches\r\nconstructed on the horizontal-bracket principle, as nine-tenths of the\r\nbridges in China are, and consequently narrow and unstable. When they\r\ndo use the true arch, it is timidly, and without much knowledge of its\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nTheir most remarkable engineering work is certainly the Great Wall,\r\nwhich defends the whole northern frontier of the country, extending over\r\nhill and dale for more than 1200 miles as the crow flies. It is,\r\nhowever, of very varying strength in different places, and seems to be\r\nstrongest and highest in the neighbourhood of Pekin, where it has\r\ngenerally been seen by Europeans. There it is 20 ft. in height, and its\r\naverage thickness is 25 ft. at the base, tapering to 15 ft. at the\r\nsummit. There are also towers at short distances whose dimensions are\r\ngenerally about double those just quoted for the wall.\r\n\r\nHowever absurd such a wall may be as a defensive expedient, it proves\r\nthat 200 years B.C. the Chinese were capable of conceiving and executing\r\nworks on as great a scale as any ever undertaken in Egypt. The wonder\r\nis, that a people who 2000 years ago were competent to such undertakings\r\nshould have attempted nothing on the same scale since that time. With\r\ntheir increasing population and accumulating wealth we might have\r\nexpected their subsequent works to have far surpassed those of the\r\nEgyptians. It, however, remains a problem to be solved, why nothing on\r\nso grand a scale was ever afterwards attempted.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the Great Wall, in the Nankau Pass, there is an archway\r\nof some architectural pretension, and which is interesting as having a\r\nwell-ascertained date, A.D. 1345.[659] Its dimensions are considerable,\r\nand it is erected in a bold style of masonry (Woodcut No. 394). The\r\nupper part is a true arch, though it was thought necessary to disguise\r\nthis by converting its form into that of a semi-octagon, or three-sided\r\narch. On the keystone is a figure of Garuda, and on either side of him a\r\nNaga figure, with a seven-headed snake hood, and beyond that a class of\r\nflowing tracery we are very familiar with in India about the period of\r\nits erection. Its similarity to the Nepalese gateway at Bhatgaon\r\n(Woodcut No. 174) has already been remarked upon, and altogether it is\r\ninteresting, as exemplifying a class of Indian ornamentation that came\r\ninto China from the North. If we had a few specimens of art penetrating\r\nfrom the south, we might find out the secret of the history of Buddhist\r\nart in China.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few years hence it may be possible to attempt to write a history of\r\narchitecture in China. At present, all that can be done is to describe\r\nthe style as practised at the present day, and to point out in what\r\nrespect it differs from the styles prevailing in neighbouring countries.\r\nBeyond this we shall not be able to advance till some qualified person,\r\naccompanied by a photographer, is enabled to visit the central and\r\nwestern provinces of the empire. Even then his visit will be of very\r\nlittle use, unless he is sufficiently familiar with the style as now\r\nknown, to be able to discriminate between what is new and what is old,\r\nand by an extended series of inductions to check the absurdities of\r\nnative tradition, and form his own opinion on the facts presented to\r\nhim. Assuming all this, it is still doubtful whether the materials exist\r\nin China for any extended history of the art. Such facts as have come to\r\nlight are not encouraging. Wood has been far too extensively used\r\nthroughout for any very permanent style of architecture ever having been\r\nemployed. But there are things in Cambodia, and other neighbouring\r\nstates, which seem to have come neither from India, nor from any other\r\ncountry we are acquainted with, but are nevertheless of foreign origin,\r\nand must have been imported from some extraneous land; and it is\r\ndifficult to say where we are to look for their originals if not in\r\ncentral or western China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 394. Archway in the Nankau Pass. (From a Photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to Japan. So far as our knowledge at present\r\nextends, there is not a single permanent building in the island of so\r\nmonumental a character to deserve being dignified by being classed among\r\nthe true architectural examples of other countries. It may be that the\r\ndread of earthquakes has prevented them raising their buildings to more\r\nthan one or two storeys in height, or constructing them of more solid\r\nmaterials than wood. It may be, however, that the Japanese do not belong\r\nto one of the building races of mankind, and have no taste for this mode\r\nof magnificence. It is the same story as in China; we shall not know\r\nwhether it is true that there are no objects worthy to be styled\r\narchitecture in Japan till the island is more scientifically explored\r\nthan it has been; nor, if they do not exist, shall we till then be able\r\nto say to which of the two above causes their absence is to be ascribed.\r\nSuch information as we have is very discouraging; and it is to be feared\r\nthat, though quaint and curious in itself, and so far worthy of\r\nattention, it is of little interest beyond the shores of the islands\r\nthemselves. On the other hand, it is to be feared that the extent of our\r\nknowledge is sufficient to make it only too clear that the art, as\r\npractised in Japan, has no title to rank with that already described in\r\nthe preceding pages, and consequently no claim to a place in a general\r\nhistory of architectural art.\r\n\r\nHowever admirable and ingenious the modern Chinese may be, it is in the\r\nminor arts--such as carving in wood and ivory, the manufacture of\r\nvessels of porcelain and bronze, and all that relates to silk and cotton\r\nmanufactures. In these they certainly excel, and reached a high degree\r\nof perfection while Europe was still barbarous, but in all the higher\r\nbranches of art they take a very low position, and seem utterly\r\nunprogressive.\r\n\r\nThey have no poetry, properly so called, and no literature worthy of the\r\nname. Their painting never rose much above the scale of decoration,\r\ntheir sculpture is more carving than anything we know by the higher\r\nname, and their architecture stands on the same low level as their other\r\narts. It is rich, ornamental, and appropriate for domestic purposes, but\r\nephemeral and totally wanting in dignity and grandeur of conception.\r\nStill it is pleasing, because truthful; but after all, its great merit\r\nin the eyes of the student of architecture will probably turn out to\r\nrest on the light it throws on the earlier styles, and on the\r\nethnographic relations of China to the surrounding nations of Eastern\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nON SOME DISPUTED POINTS OF INDIAN CHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the preceding pages the dates of kings’ reigns, where quoted,\r\nhave been assumed as known, and the eras from which they are calculated\r\nas ascertained. This has been done in order not to interrupt the\r\nnarrative of events by introducing a chronological disquisition at every\r\npoint where a date occurs; but no one at all familiar with the subject\r\nneeds to be told that the dates of mediæval dynasties in India are far\r\nfrom settled, and that few are universally acquiesced in. Great progress\r\nhas, it is true, been made in the last ten or twenty years in clearing\r\naway the difficulties that surround the subject. So much is this the\r\ncase, that there are only one or two dates of sufficient importance to\r\naffect our reasoning which still remain in doubt; but though this may be\r\ntrue, there are many others about which the world in general feel\r\nconsiderable hesitation. It consequently becomes almost indispensable to\r\nstate briefly the grounds on which the chronology used throughout this\r\nwork is based, in order that the correctness of most of the inductions\r\nstated in it may be estimated at their true value.[660]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earliest reasonable statement bearing on the subject which we\r\npossess is in the 9th chapter of Arrian’s ‘Indica.’ It is there\r\nstated--quoting from Megasthenes--“That from Bacchus (Ixwaku) to\r\nSandrocottus (Chandragupta), the Indians reckon one hundred and\r\nfifty-three monarchs, who reigned during the space of six thousand and\r\nforty-two years.”\r\n\r\nThe first part of this statement is eminently satisfactory, as it seems\r\nclear from it that we possess in the Puranas the same lists as were\r\nsubmitted to the Greeks in the fourth century B.C. In the Solar lists,\r\nwe have in the Treta Yug sixty-two reigns, from Ixwaku to Rama.[661]\r\nThere is no complete Lunar list in that age. For the Dwapar age we have\r\nthree Solar lists: one for Kusha to Vrihadsana, thirty-five reigns;\r\nanother from Dishta to Janamejaya, thirty-three reigns; and a third,\r\nfrom the son of Swadhaja, the father of Sita, wife of Rama, to Mahabasi,\r\nthirty-four reigns. In the Kali Yug we have no complete Solar list, but\r\nthe Lunar list gives fifty descents from Jarasandha to the last Nanda.\r\nThis gives 145 or 146 reigns, or rather too few. But the Lunar lists,\r\nfrom the Dwapar Yug, give forty-four from Puru to Yudhishihira, and\r\nfifty from Yadu to Krishna, so that the average is as nearly as may be\r\nthat stated by Megasthenes.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the statement, giving these kings’ reigns an average\r\nduration of nearly forty years, must of course be rejected, but it is\r\nsatisfactory to find that, at that early age, the falsification of the\r\nchronology had only gone to the extent of duplication, and that the\r\nmonstrous system of Yugs, with all their attendant absurdities, had not\r\nthen been invented.\r\n\r\nThough it may not at present be capable of direct proof, I have myself\r\nno doubt that the date assigned by the Hindus for the Kali Yug (3101\r\nB.C.) is a true date, though misapplied. It either was the date when the\r\nAryans assumed that their ancestors had first crossed the Indus, or when\r\nthey had first settled on the banks of the Saraswati or the Ghoghra. It\r\nforms no part of any subsequently invented system, and seems the only\r\none fixed point in a sea of falsification. Assuming it for the present,\r\nand deducting Chandragupta’s date from it, we have 3101-325 = 2776 years\r\nfrom Ixwaku to Chandragupta, which, divided by 153, gives the reasonable\r\nnumber of eighteen years for the duration of each king’s reign. Of\r\ncourse it is not contended that these lists are absolutely to be\r\ndepended upon--many names may be lost, and many misplaced, from the\r\ncarelessness of copyists, or from other causes; but, on the whole, when\r\ntreated in this manner, they afford a reasonable framework for the\r\nreconstruction of the ancient history of India, and one that accords\r\nperfectly with all we at present know about the ancient history of the\r\nimmigrant Aryans.\r\n\r\nIf this view can be sustained, the events which are described in the\r\nRamayana--not of course the poem, which is comparatively modern--took\r\nplace about 2000 years before Christ. Adhering to the above average, we\r\ngather that the events described in the ‘Mahabharata,’ in like manner,\r\noccurred 900 years before Chandragupta, or 1225, or more precisely,\r\naccording to the Puranic chronology, thus--\r\n\r\n                                                 B.C.\r\nChandragupta                                     325\r\nSisunagas, 360 years                             360\r\nSunakas                                          128\r\nSabadeva to Ripunjaya, 23 reigns at 18 years     414\r\n                                                ----\r\n                                                1227\r\n                                                ----\r\n\r\nwhich may probably be taken as very near the true date.\r\n\r\nIt must for the present remain an open question whether the dates just\r\nquoted can be so established as to stand the test of the exigencies of\r\nmodern critical acumen. It would be very satisfactory if this could be\r\nso accomplished. In the first place, because it would afford a firm\r\nbasis for all our reasoning regarding the ancient history and\r\nethnography of India, but also because it would prove that the Puranas\r\ndo contain the germs of truths which, when properly investigated, may\r\nlead to the most important deductions. My own impression is entirely in\r\nfavour of the existence of the requisite materials for the purpose; but\r\nthe fashion has been lately to pooh-pooh the whole thing, and no attempt\r\nhas been made--so far as I know--by any competent scholar, to\r\ninvestigate the matter on scientific principles.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, when we come to the Anjana era, 691 B.C.,[662] and\r\nthe life of Buddha, we tread on surer ground; and it is fortunate for\r\nour purposes that it so, as with the life of Buddha the mediæval history\r\nof India may be said to commence, and unless his date and that of his\r\nsuccessors can be established with at least approximate certainty, the\r\nhistory of architecture in India must remain unintelligible. In this\r\ninstance, however, the materials, I believe, exist in abundance. They\r\nhave not, it is true, been as yet investigated to such an extent as to\r\nrender any point certain, but the difficulties are daily disappearing,\r\nand as every point gained adds materially in throwing light on others\r\nthat have hitherto been considered unsettled, we may hope before long to\r\nsee the whole satisfactorily resolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no single point in the whole early history of India on\r\nwhich the chronicles of Ceylon and Further India are so distinct and\r\nunanimous than that Buddha died--as they express it, attained\r\nNirvana--at the age of eighty years, in the year 543 B.C., or in the\r\nyear 148 of the Eetzana[663] or Anjana epoch.[664]\r\n\r\nAttempts have recently been made, it appears to me on the most illogical\r\nand insufficient data, to invalidate this conclusion. There is an\r\nadmitted falsification in the Ceylonese annals, as set forth in the\r\n‘Mahawanso,’ of sixty years about this date; but as Turnour, who first\r\npointed it out, explained also the reason for it,[665] the rectification\r\nis easy, and the result clear. It seems that Vijaya, the first Indian\r\nimmigrant or conqueror of Ceylon, landed in the island 483 years B.C.,\r\nor thereabout; and the reigns of his successors, down to\r\nDevenampiyatisso, the contemporary of Asoka, when added together, amount\r\nto only 236 years. When the annals came to be expounded in the\r\n‘Mahawanso,’ it was thought expedient, for the good of religion, that\r\nthe coming of Vijaya should be coincident with the death of Buddha; and\r\nas the sacred era could not be disturbed, Asoka’s reign was carried back\r\nso as to admit of the adjustment. This was effected principally by\r\nreducing the epoch of the nine Nandas from 100 years, at which the\r\nPuranas place them, to forty-four, and by other slight alterations. The\r\nsixty years was afterwards recovered by small increments to subsequent\r\nreigns, not of much consequence, but injuriously affecting the\r\ncorrectness of the whole chronology of the ‘Mahawanso,’ down to about\r\nA.D. 400, when it was compiled in its present form. As the date of\r\nAsako’s reign is perfectly well known (272-236 B.C.), we have only to\r\nreject the most improbable coincidence of Vijaya landing on the day of\r\nBuddha’s Nirvana, which there is nothing to support, and the whole\r\nbecomes clear, and everything falls into its place.[666]\r\n\r\nBesides the Ceylonese lists, and those quoted by Crawfurd from the\r\nBurmese annals,[667] the Puranas afford us two, quoted below, which are\r\nof great interest to us, and the whole are so marvellously coincident,\r\nthat there seems very little doubt of their general authenticity.\r\n\r\n           SOLAR LIST.          |             LUNAR LIST.\r\n                                |\r\n                                |_Saisunaga Dynasty reigned 360 years._\r\n                                |\r\n                           B.C. |                                 B.C.\r\nKritanjaya                 691  | Sisunaga                        685\r\nRananjaya                   --  | Kakavarna                        --\r\nSanjaya                     --  | Kshemadharman                    --\r\nSakya                       --  | Kshetranjas                      --\r\nSuddhodana                  --  | Bimbisara                       603\r\n                                |        _Kanwapana_, 9.\r\n                                |        _Bhumiputra_, 14.\r\nRatula                      --  | Ajatasatru                      551\r\nPrasenajit                  --  | Udayaswa                        519\r\nKshudraka                   --  | Dasaka                          503\r\nKundaka                     --  | Nagadasoka                      495\r\nSuratha                     --  | Sisunaga                        471\r\nSumitra                    451? | Kalasoka                        453\r\n                                | Maha Nanda                      425\r\n                                | Sumalya                          --\r\n                                | 7 Nandas                         --\r\n                                |   _Interregnum Kautilya ending_ 325\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first or Solar list, Professor Wilson remarks, that\r\n“Sakya is no doubt the name of the author or reviver of Buddhism, but is\r\nout of place, as he was the son and not the father of Suddhodana.”[668]\r\nThis, however, is only one of the numerous instances in which the\r\ngrandson takes his grandfather’s name, and which is an interminable\r\ncause of confusion in Indian chronological inquiries.[669] Gautama, as\r\nwe know, never ascended the throne, but devoted himself to his religious\r\nduties, but his son Ratula succeeded his grandfather. In like manner,\r\nthe Prasenajit in the list is not the cousin and companion of Buddha,\r\nbut the grandson, or grand-nephew of that earlier king of the same name.\r\nSumitra, the last name mentioned in the Bhagavat Purana, seems to have\r\nascended the throne about 451. There are no exact dates for fixing this\r\nevent, and with him perished the long line of Solar monarchs, who for\r\nmore than twenty-six centuries--if our chronology is correct--had\r\ninfluenced in so marked a manner the destinies of India.\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of Kalasoka, the eleventh king of this dynasty,\r\nthat the second convocation was held, 100 years after the Nirvana. This,\r\ntoo, it has recently become the fashion to doubt. The accounts, however,\r\nin the ‘Mahawanso,’ and the pointed mode in which it is referred to in\r\nthe Burmese annals, seem sufficient to settle the point. Like Vijaya’s\r\nlanding in Ceylon on the day of Buddha’s Nirvana, Prome is said to have\r\nbeen founded 443, the year of this convocation.[670] They must have\r\nbelieved strongly, or they would not have attempted the adjustment.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, we have neither buildings, nor coins, nor\r\ninscriptions belonging to this period, nor indeed any material facts\r\nthat would enable us to verify the chronological data. It is, however,\r\nso near the time when these became abundant, that it does not seem\r\nunreasonable to hope that some such evidences may turn up. Till\r\nsomething is found, the absence of all such materials must remain as a\r\ncurious piece of evidence regarding the important influence that the\r\ncontact of the nations of the West had on the arts and civilization of\r\nIndia at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURYA, SUNGA, AND KANWA DYNASTIES.\r\n\r\n         CHRONOLOGY.

The whole, too, is\r\nnow found to be so perfectly in accord with the architecture of their\r\nage, and with such inscriptions as have been found, that I see no reason\r\nwhatever for doubting its general correctness.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal point on which the whole hinges is the twelfth year of\r\nAsoka’s reign after his consecration--the sixteenth from his\r\ninauguration. In that year he published his rock-cut edicts, in which he\r\nmentions his allies, Antiochus and Antigonus, Ptolemy (Philadelphus),\r\nMagas (of Cyrene), and Alexander (of Macedonia).[671] As it happens, all\r\nthese five names are mentioned together in Justin’s abridgment of Trogus\r\nPompeius (xxvi. 2, 3 and xxvii. 1), though without giving any date. As\r\nMagas, however, died B.C. 257, and the only year in which all five were\r\nalive together was either that year or the preceding, we may safely\r\nassume that the sixteenth of Asoka was B.C. 256 or B.C. 257. If that is\r\nso it seems impossible to bring down the date of the accession of\r\nChandragupta to a time more modern than one or two years after B.C. 325.\r\nThe Ceylonese annals allow him thirty-four years,[672] but our knowledge\r\nof what happened in India in Alexander’s time forbids any such\r\nextension. On the other hand, his accession happening in the year, or\r\nthe year after, the defeat of Porus, is not exactly what we would expect\r\nfrom the context; but there is nothing, so far as I know, to controvert\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEven if it were not so certain as it appears to be from the statements\r\njust quoted, there can be no doubt that the chronology of this period\r\ncan easily be settled from the numerous inscriptions found in the\r\nrock-cut excavations quoted in the table, as well as from coins and\r\nother materials that exist. These dynasties thus become a fixed\r\nstarting-point for all our inquiries, either backwards or forwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDRA, OR ANDRABRITYA DYNASTY.\r\n\r\n       CHRONOLOGY.

There are slight\r\ndiscrepancies of course, not only as to names but as to the duration of\r\nthis dynasty in the different Puranas. Thus the Vishnu Parana, according\r\nto Wilson, enumerates thirty kings, reigning 456 years; the Vayu and\r\nBhagavat the same. The Matsya gives only twenty-nine kings, but makes\r\nthem reign 460 years; but none of them give all the names, nor does the\r\naddition of the longest list extend beyond 435 years.[673] The whole,\r\nfrom Chandragupta to the last, are also added together (p. 232), and\r\nmake up 751 years, or bringing the last of the Andras down to A.D. 426.\r\nThe actual fixation of these dates will probably be found in Nassick\r\ncave inscriptions. Two of these bear dates: one, apparently in the reign\r\nof Pulomavi, or Padma, is dated nineteen from an unspecified era; the\r\nother is in the twenty-fourth year of the “modern era,” and the act\r\nrecorded is, apparently, by order of Gautamiputra.[674] As it is,\r\nhowever, almost certain that the Gupta era, A.D. 319, was established in\r\nthe reign of the last-named king, it seems probable that when these\r\ninscriptions are more carefully examined than they hitherto have been,\r\nthey will fix these reigns with even greater certainty than we obtain\r\nfrom the Puranic dates; the one element of uncertainty being that the\r\nnew era does not seem to be dated either from the accession of the king\r\nor from any great event, but four cycles of sixty years, or 240 years\r\nfrom the Saka era it was intended to supersede.[675]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be settled, it cannot disturb either the initial or the\r\nfinal dates of this dynasty, nor affect to a greater extent than say ten\r\nor twelve years the period of 751, which extended from the accession of\r\nChandragupta to the final overthrow of the Andras in or about A.D. 426.\r\n\r\nThis being so, it is evident that these four dynasties form the backbone\r\nof our mediæval chronology of India to which all minor events must be\r\nfitted, and fortunately most of them do so without any difficulty. It\r\nwas the great period of Buddhist supremacy in India. There were, it is\r\ntrue, Buddhists in India before Asoka, but they were then only a sect,\r\nand Buddhism was a religion for two centuries after the fall of the\r\nAndras. It was then, however, a struggling faction. The modern Hindu\r\nreligion was gradually raising its head under the Gupta and Ujjain\r\nprinces, and in the 8th century it superseded Buddhism in most parts of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nA great part of the uncertainty that of late years has crept into the\r\nchronology of this period is owing to the neglect with which these\r\ndynasties have been treated by modern investigators. This has arisen\r\nprincipally from the extreme rarity of their coins, while it has been\r\nprincipally from numismatic researches that progress has been made in\r\nthe elucidation of many dark passages of Indian history. Coinage was,\r\nhowever, a most distinctly foreign importation into India. The Bactrian\r\nGreeks were the coiners _par excellence_, and it is through their coins,\r\nand those only, that complete lists of their kings down to 130 B.C. have\r\nbeen compiled. It is only from their coins also that we know the names\r\nof the barbarian kings who succeeded them, or those of the Sah kings,\r\nwho appear next in our list. But the four dynasties from Chandragupta\r\nto Chandrasri were of native kings, who had only indirectly, if at all,\r\ncome in contact with the Greeks, and had never learnt the art of\r\ncoining, or, at least, used it to a sufficient extent to enable us to\r\nidentify their names or succession from their coins. Their caves, and\r\nthe inscriptions with which they covered their walls, are fast supplying\r\nthe information their coins, if they had existed, would have afforded;\r\nbut the investigation has not been taken up by those who have the ear of\r\nthe public to the same extent as the numismatists. Enough, however, has\r\nbeen done to show that the materials exist for establishing the history\r\nof these dynasties on a sure basis; and when this is done from\r\ninscriptions combined with architecture, the results are more\r\nsatisfactory than when dependent on numismatic evidence alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAH KINGS OF SAURASTRA.\r\n\r\n                 COIN DATES.

It is almost wholly numismatic. The founder of the dynasty,\r\nNahapana, describes himself as the viceroy or satrap of King\r\nKshaharata,[677] certainly a foreigner, who conquered the country and\r\nheld it in subjection for nearly 300 years.\r\n\r\nThe one point that interests us here is to ascertain from what era the\r\ndates on the coins are to be calculated. When I previously wrote on the\r\nsubject,[678] I felt inclined to adopt a suggestion that Nahapana was\r\nthe founder of the era known afterwards as that of Vicramaditya, B.C.\r\n56. I did this principally because I felt certain that no king of that\r\nname reigned in the first century B.C., and I could discover no event\r\noccurring about that time so important as to deserve to be commemorated\r\nby an era.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a foreign conquest and the foundation of a new\r\ndynasty were just such events as would be so celebrated; and, pending\r\nfurther evidence, this assumption seemed to account for what was\r\notherwise inexplicable in the foundation of this era. Since then,\r\nhowever, a more careful study of Rudra Daman’s Bridge inscription,[679]\r\nand the architectural evidence detailed in the preceding pages, have\r\nconvinced me that such a theory was untenable. The Bridge inscription is\r\ndated in the year 72, from the same era from which all the coins of\r\nthese kings are dated. In it he boasts “that, after twice conquering the\r\nSata Karni, Lord of Dakshinapatha, he did not completely destroy him on\r\naccount of their near connexion, and thus obtained glory.” And he boasts\r\nof conquering, among other countries, Anupa, Saurastra, Asva Kutcha,\r\nKukura, Aparanta, &c.[680]\r\n\r\nA little further on in our history, Gautamiputra, in whose reign the era\r\nwas established which was afterwards adopted by the Guptas and\r\nBallabhis, boasts, in an inscription in a cave at Nassick, that he had\r\nconquered, among others, all the countries above enumerated, and as\r\nhaving re-established the glory of the Satavahana dynasty, and destroyed\r\nthe race of Khagarata.[681] All this reveals a state of matters that\r\nwill not accord with the Vicramaditya era, but does perfectly agree with\r\nthat of Salivahana.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the Sata Karni dynasty is correctly represented in the\r\nPuranas, as enumerated above, Rudra Dama would, on the assumption that\r\nthe dates were Samvat, have been reigning A.D. 16 (72-56), immediately\r\nafter the establishment of the dynasty, and before the long and\r\nprosperous reign of Sata Karni II., which could hardly have taken place\r\nhad his family been smitten so early in their career. But if we assume\r\nthat it was A.D. 151 (79+72), it would coincide with the reign of the\r\nthird king of that name, and at a time when, so far as we can judge from\r\nthe length of the reigns, and the careless way they are enumerated in\r\nthe Puranas, the fortunes of the family were considerably depressed; and\r\nit is little more than a century and a half after this time that\r\nGautamiputra restored the fortunes of his family. Had 300 years elapsed\r\nbetween these two events, the family could hardly ever have attained the\r\nposition it did.\r\n\r\nAnother point of more importance is, that the dates on the Sah\r\ncoins--from whatever era calculated--extend only to 270-271, or\r\ndoubtfully to 292.[682] If these are calculated from the Vicramaditya\r\nSamvat, they must have ceased to reign in A.D. 214, or at the latest\r\nA.D. 236, and there would have been no Khagaratas for Gautamiputra to\r\nhumble after A.D. 312. On the other hand, if calculated from A.D. 79,\r\ntheir final extinction would have been in A.D. 349, or at latest A.D.\r\n371. So that, though humbled by Gautamiputra, they overlap the Gupta era\r\nto some extent, which it seems is almost indispensable to account for\r\nthe mode in which the Sah coins overlap and run into those of the Gupta\r\nseries, on which Mr. Thomas so strongly and, it appears to me, so\r\ncorrectly insists.[683]\r\n\r\nOne of two things seems necessary: either that the Guptas shall be\r\ncarried back so as to overlap the Sahs, dating either from the\r\nVicramadityan or Selucidan eras, or that the Sahs be brought down so as\r\nto overlap them, if dating from the era bearing their name. Mr. Thomas\r\nand General Cunningham prefer the former hypothesis. For the reasons\r\njust stated, and others to be given further on, I feel convinced that\r\nthe latter hypothesis is the only one that is in accordance with the\r\nfacts of the case as we now know them.\r\n\r\nThis substitution of the Saka era for the Samvat brings what we know of\r\nthe history, with what we learn from the inscriptions, and gather from\r\nthe coins, so completely into accordance, that I can hardly doubt now\r\nthat it is the correct view of the matter, and certainly more in\r\naccordance with the facts than that I previously adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUPTAS.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Puranas conduct us in so reasonable and satisfactory a\r\nmanner to the end of the Andrabritya dynasty, their guidance forsakes us\r\nthere. After that, all the subsequent contemporary dynasties were thrown\r\ninto hotch-pot--to use a legal expression--and a system of fraud and\r\nfalsification commenced which is the reproach of Indian history. It is\r\nnot, however, difficult to see the causes of this new and monstrous\r\ninvention. For six centuries and a half Buddhism had reigned supreme in\r\nIndia, and the system of the Brahmans, though probably never extinct,\r\nwas at least subdued and subordinate. With the decline of the Andras\r\nthis state of affairs was altered. The Guptas, who immediately succeeded\r\nthem, are shown, both by their coins and inscriptions, to have been\r\nfollowers of Vishnu and Siva,[684] and their buildings at Erun tell the\r\nsame story.[685]\r\n\r\nThough the Guptas may have inaugurated the new system, it was by the\r\ngreat Vicramaditya of Ujjain that it was established, A.D. 515-550. He\r\ndid for the new religion what Asoka had done for Buddhism some seven and\r\na half centuries before his time. He made a state religion in India, and\r\nestablished it so firmly that little more than a century after his death\r\nit seems to have superseded Buddhism altogether. It is in his reign,\r\napparently, that the Puranic system was invented--not that the Puranas\r\nwere written or all the falsifications of history invented in his day,\r\nbut a commencement was then made, and by the 10th or 11th century of our\r\nera it was brought to the complete perfection of fraud in which it is\r\nnow found.\r\n\r\nOne of the first necessities of the new system was to throw back the\r\nperiod when India was Buddhist, and to place a gulf between them and\r\ntheir successors. To effect this, the Puranas enumerate the\r\nfollowing:--“After these” (the Andrabrityas) “various races will\r\nreign--seven Abhiras, ten Gardabhilas, sixteen Sakas, eight Yavanas,\r\nfourteen Tusharas, thirteen Mandas, eleven Maunas or\r\nHunas[686]--seventy-nine princes will be sovereigns of the earth for\r\n1399 years. Then eleven Pauras will be kings for 300 years; when they\r\nare destroyed, Kailakila Yavanas will be kings, the chiefs of whom will\r\nbe Vindhya Sacti, &c.--106 years.” After various others: “The nine Nagas\r\nwill reign in Padmavati, Kantipura, and Mathura; and the Guptas of\r\nMagadha along the Ganges to Pryaga.”[687] Although we cannot identify\r\nall these dynasties with certainty, we know, at all events, that,\r\ninstead of succeeding one another during more than 2000 years, they were\r\nall more or less contemporary--certainly that none were earlier than the\r\nGupta era (A.D. 319)--and that none of them survived Vicramaditya (A.D.\r\n550). The Sakas and Maunas, or Hunas, may be those destroyed by him, but\r\nof this hereafter. The Vindhya Sactis were contemporary with the Guptas,\r\nand the Gardabhilas are somehow connected with Bahram Gaur the\r\nSassanian; and others we recognise dimly, but they are not sufficiently\r\nimportant to be discussed here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all these the most important are the Guptas, and fortunately their\r\ndate is one of the most clearly established facts in mediæval Indian\r\nchronology.[688]\r\n\r\n    DYNASTY.

It was only Chandra Gupta I.,\r\nA.D. 401, who assumed the title of Maharaja adhiraja, and founded the\r\ngreatness of his race on the ruins of that of the Andrabrityas.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above chronology, compiled from coins and dated\r\ninscriptions, Major Watson has recently supplied a most important item\r\nto their history from written records existing in Gujerat.\r\n\r\nFrom this we learn that Chandra Gupta II. reigned twenty-three years\r\nafter the conquest of Saurastra by his son; that Kumara Pal Gupta\r\nreigned twenty years; and that Skanda Gupta succeeded him, but lost\r\nSaurastra by the rebellion of his Senapati Bhatarka, the founder of the\r\nBallabhi family. Two years after this event Skanda Gupta died, and, as\r\nwe are informed, “at this time the Gupta race were dethroned by foreign\r\ninvaders.”[689]\r\n\r\nThe era from which these dates are taken never appeared to me doubtful;\r\nand this confirms more and more the conviction that it was from the era\r\nthat bears their name, A.D. 319. It could not be from the Saka era, as\r\nhas generally been assumed, from the fact that Albiruni asserts that the\r\nera that bears their name, was “apparently” that of their\r\ndestruction,[690] because in that case Skanda Gupta must have lived and\r\nreigned for ninety-four years in addition to the sixteen we already\r\nknow, from inscriptions, he occupied the throne. A reign of 110 years\r\nseems impossible; and, if it is not so, it seems certain, for the\r\nreasons stated in my previous paper, that the Gupta era, 319, is that\r\nfrom which their coins and inscriptions are dated.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there is an inscription on the rock at Junaghar, engraved\r\nby the same Skanda, the last of the great Guptas. This was not\r\ntranslated by Prinsep, though a copy of it was in his hands before his\r\nlast illness.[691] Had he lived to translate it, my impression is that\r\nthe controversy as to the age of the Guptas never would have arisen--its\r\nevidence seems so absolute. Be this as it may, it never appeared, so far\r\nas I know, in a complete form and translated, till this was accomplished\r\nby the late Bhau Daji in the sixth volume of the Bombay Journal of 1862.\r\nIn it we have three dates--the Sadarsana lake is said to have burst its\r\nbanks in 130, to have been repaired in 137, and a temple to Vishnu built\r\nin 138, and twice it is repeated “_counting from the era of the Guptas_”\r\n(Guptasya Kala). The stone is worn where the middle date occurs, but\r\nthere is just space enough for these words. The same king, on the Kuhaon\r\npillar, dates his inscription in 141,[692] but without mentioning the\r\nera, which seems to have been so usual in Bengal as not to require being\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the 146[693] years from 319, which we know from their\r\ndated inscriptions that they reigned, is just the interval that is\r\nrequired to fill up the gap between the Ballabhis and their era which\r\nthey adopted on usurping the inheritance of the Guptas, two years before\r\nSkanda Gupta’s death.[694]\r\n\r\nOne other point of considerable importance to Indian history which\r\narises from the fixation of this date (A.D. 465-70) for the destruction\r\nof the Guptas is, that it was almost certainly the White Huns who were\r\nthe “foreign invaders” that struck the blow that stopped their career.\r\nAt least, we learn from Cosmas Indicopleustes, writing seventy years\r\nafter this time, that the Huns were a powerful nation in the north of\r\nIndia in his day, and we may infer, from what he says of them, had been\r\nsettled there some time.[695]\r\n\r\nOn the Bhitari Lât, Bhau Daji reads--somewhat doubtfully, it must be\r\nconfessed--the fact that Skanda Gupta had fought, apparently with\r\nsuccess, against the Hunas.[696] But the great point is that it was just\r\nabout this time that the White Huns broke loose and extended their\r\nincursions east and west, so that there is not only no improbability of\r\ntheir being the “foreign invaders” alluded to, but every likelihood they\r\nwere so. No one, indeed, can, I believe, with the knowledge we now\r\npossess, read De Guignes’ chapter on the White Huns,[697] without\r\nperceiving that it contains the key to the solution of many mysterious\r\npassages in Indian history. It is true India is not mentioned there; but\r\nfrom the time of Bahram Gaur in 420, till the defeat of Feroze in 475,\r\nthe Persians were waging an internecine war with these Huns, and nothing\r\ncan be more likely than that the varying fortunes of that struggle\r\nshould force them to seek the alliance of the then powerful Guptas, to\r\nassist them against their common foe.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same impression is conveyed by what is said by Ferishta\r\nand the Persian historians[698] of the history of that time. Nothing can\r\nnow, however, be more easily intelligible than the visit of Bahram Gaur\r\nto India when first attacked by the White Huns. His marriage with an\r\nIndian (? Gupta) princess of Canouge; the tribute or assistance claimed\r\nby Feroze and his successors on the Persian throne, are all easily\r\nexplicable, on the assumption that the two nations were at that time\r\nengaged in a struggle against a common enemy. This, too, explains the\r\nmention of the Shah in Shahi on Samudra Gupta’s Allahabad\r\ninscription.[699] Hence, too, the decided Persian influence on the gold\r\ncoinage of the Canouge Guptas,[700] and the innumerable Sassanian coins\r\nof that period found in all parts of the north of India.[701] In all\r\nthis the Sassanians seem inseparably mixed with the Guptas. The\r\nPersians, however, came eventually victorious out of the war. The great\r\nGuptas were struck down at some date between 465-70, or very shortly\r\nafterwards. The struggle, however, was apparently continued for some\r\ntime longer by a subordinate branch of their successors; inasmuch as we\r\nlearn from an inscription found at Aphsar in Behar,[702] that the fourth\r\nof that dynasty, Damodara Gupta, “successfully encountered, at the\r\nbattle of Maushari, the fierce army of the Western Huns.” This event may\r\nhave stopped the career of the Huns in India, in which case it could not\r\nwell have taken place before the year 535, when Cosmas Indicopleustes is\r\nsupposed to have written his ‘Topographia Christiana;’ but it is by no\r\nmeans clear that he was not describing events that took place when he\r\nwas himself in India some time previously. But be this as it may, it\r\nbrings us to the time when the battles of Korûr--of which more\r\nhereafter--and Maushari freed India from the Sakas and Hunas, who had\r\nlong held her in hated subjection. As I shall presently attempt to show,\r\nit appears to me hardly doubtful that these two battles were fought\r\nbetween 524 and 544; and they thus fix one of the most important epochs\r\nin mediæval Indian history. Indeed, so near each other are these two\r\nevents in date, that I sometimes feel almost inclined to fancy they may\r\nbe only different names for the same battle. At all events, they almost\r\ncertainly represent parts of the same campaign which freed India in that\r\nage from the Yavanas; and that it was to commemorate the glories of\r\nthese struggles that the Vicramaditya Samvat was instituted. This\r\nexpulsion of the Yavanas was, too, the first serious blow that was\r\nstruck at Buddhist supremacy, and from the effects of which it never\r\nafterwards completely recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLABHI DYNASTY.\r\n\r\n                      DATES ON INSCRIPTIONS.

Apparemment\r\nBallabha suivit immédiatement les Gouptas, car l’ère des Gouptas\r\ncommence aussi 241 de l’ère de Saca.”[703] This we learn also, with the\r\nparticulars how it happened, from Colonel Watson’s account of the\r\ntransaction; while Colonel Tod’s celebrated Puttun Somnath inscription\r\nmakes it also certain that the Ballabhi era commenced A.D. 319.[704]\r\nThis being so, it seems difficult to understand why the era should have\r\nbeen called that of Ballabhi as well as that of the Guptas, unless it\r\nwere that it was adopted by the first-named dynasty, and that they dated\r\nfrom it their acts and inscriptions, which are extremely numerous. There\r\nmay be reasons why this should be otherwise; but, though the point has\r\nbeen generally and fiercely contested by eminent Indian chronologists, I\r\nfail to appreciate the arguments brought forward in favour of either the\r\nVicramaditya or Saka eras,[705] and look upon their own era (A.D. 319)\r\nas certainly the one from which all the Gupta inscriptions are dated.\r\n\r\nMy impression is, that this would never have been considered doubtful\r\nbut for an incautious statement by Colonel Tod that Ballabhi was\r\ndestroyed by the Parthians A.D. 524,[706] in the reign of a Siladitya,\r\nits last king. Its inhabitants were, according to this account,\r\nslaughtered with the usual romantic incidents; but after a while a\r\nremnant established themselves in Sidhapore, and finally built a new\r\ncapital, which they called Anhilwarra.\r\n\r\nThe utter falsity of the information so supplied to Colonel Tod is\r\nproved by the fact that when Ballabhi was visited by Hiouen Thsang, 115\r\nyears after its reputed destruction, he found it not only standing, and\r\nneither Sidhapore nor Anhilwarra thought of, but the old capital still\r\nremaining one of the richest and most prosperous cities of India, and\r\nits king one of the three greatest kings of northern India. The king’s\r\nname was Dhruvapaton, and he was a nephew or grand-nephew of Siladitya\r\nof Malwa, and the son-in-law of Siladitya, the reigning king of\r\nCanouge.[707] Lastly, we have the dates in copper-plates of a\r\nDhruvasena, one in 310+319=629; the other 322+ 319, or 641,[708] the\r\nvery year that Hiouen Thsang met him at Allahabad, if we assume them\r\ndated from the Ballabhi Samvat.\r\n\r\nIt would be satisfactory if we could determine the date of the\r\ndestruction of Ballabhi with precision, as it is one of these events\r\nthat mark an epoch in Indian history. It was one of the concluding acts\r\nof the old drama that closed the mediæval period of Indian history, and\r\nushered in the dark ages which lasted more than two centuries from that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe materials for this hardly exist at present, though it may be\r\napproximated. We have numerous inscriptions of this dynasty, dated 310,\r\n326, 338, 348, &c.,[709] or A.D. 629, 645, 657, 667 respectively, if the\r\nfigures are all correctly read, which is not quite clear; and lastly,\r\nMr. Burgess reports one dated 400, or A.D. 719, belonging to the last\r\nSiladitya, and consequently approaching very nearly to the event. Two\r\naccounts are current as to the mode in which the destruction was\r\neffected: one, that it was caused by an earthquake, which may have\r\nhappened at any time;[710] the other (by Tod), that the city was\r\ndestroyed by the Parthians. If it was by a foreign foe, it could only\r\nhave been by the Mahomedans. They were on the Indus in strength in 22\r\nHegira,[711] or A.D. 644, or before Hiouen Thsang had left India, and no\r\nforeigner could have crossed the Indus or attacked Ballabhi after that\r\ntime, or for some years before it, without being noticed by Mahomedan\r\nhistorians. They remained there in strength till after Mahomed Kasim,\r\n711-715,[712] and it was to him that I was at one time inclined to\r\nascribe the destruction. If, however, Mr. Burgess’s date is correct, his\r\ndeath was three years too early. But I do not think it at all improbable\r\nthat Ballabhi is one of the cities--Barus and Uzain--said to be\r\nplundered by Junaid in A.D. 725 or 726.[713] Barus looks very like\r\nBaroach, and Uzain is almost certainly Ujjain--but whether Maliba is\r\nBallabhi, I must leave others to determine.\r\n\r\nAll the accounts agree that Anhilwarra Puttun was founded Samvat 802, or\r\nA.D. 746,[714] which may be correct within a year or two; but from the\r\naccounts we have, it is clear that an interval of from twenty to thirty\r\nyears must have elapsed between the two events, during which the\r\ninhabitants of the destroyed city sought refuge at Punchâsur and\r\nSidhapore before they undertook the building of their new capital. If,\r\ntherefore, we assume 725 as the date of the destruction of Ballabhi, we\r\nshall probably not err more than a year or two either way.\r\n\r\nThe earliest date of this family yet discovered is one on a copperplate\r\nof Dharasena II., which has been read by Professor Bhandarkar as\r\n272,[715] or, according to the views here adopted, 591. It is hardly\r\nprobable that any much earlier will be found; for it must be borne in\r\nmind that though the Ballabhis wrested the sovereignty of Gujerat from\r\nthe Guptas two years before Skanda’s death (_ante_, p. 724), neither the\r\nfirst nor second of the race ventured to assume even the modest title of\r\nRaja; they were content to remain Senâpatis, or Generals. The third\r\ncalls himself Maharaja; but their greatness only culminated in or about\r\nA.D. 650, when one of them, Sri Dharasena III., became Maharaja\r\nAdhiraja--King of kings or Emperor of Northern India.[716] The reason of\r\nthis, as we shall presently see, was that the family that really\r\nsucceeded the Guptas in the place of supreme authority in India was that\r\nof Ujjain, the second or third monarch of this race being the celebrated\r\nVicramaditya, whose date, for reasons to be given hereafter, seems\r\nalmost certainly to have been from 515 to 550. Be this as it may, as we\r\nshall presently see, it seems quite certain that a great Brahmanical\r\nrevival took place in the beginning of the 6th century, which quite\r\novershadowed all the Buddhist dynasties in northern India. For a while\r\nthese were again eclipsed by a reflex wave of Buddhism, which for a\r\ncentury--A.D. 550-650--again illumined India. It was a last expiring\r\neffort, however, and after the last-named date it was only a struggle\r\nfor existence on the part of the Buddhists, and in another century they\r\nare known no longer in those central countries where they had so long\r\nreigned supreme.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALUKYA DYNASTIES.\r\n\r\n         WESTERN BRANCH.                  |    EASTERN BRANCH.\r\n        CAPITAL KALYAN.                   |  CAPITAL RAJMEHENDRI.\r\n1.

The latest of their inscriptions is\r\ndestruction by the Mahomedans in 1310.    |dated A.D. 1336.\r\n\r\nThe two lists in the preceding page are among the most interesting and\r\nmost important of those we possess, inasmuch as they contain the\r\nbackbone of all we know regarding the Chalukyas, and are, in fact, what\r\njustify us, historically, in erecting their style into a separate\r\ndivision, different from the other forms of architecture known in India.\r\n\r\nWhat we know of these dynasties is almost wholly due to the intelligent\r\nzeal of Sir Walter Elliot, who, during his residence in India, made a\r\ncollection of 595 inscriptions from various parts of the Dekhan. From\r\nthese he abstracted the lists he first published in the fourth volume of\r\nthe Royal Asiatic Society; but afterwards much more in detail in the\r\n‘Madras Journal,’ in 1858, from which these lists are copied\r\nverbatim.[717] Some of the inscriptions were translated and published\r\nwith those papers, and others by Major--now General--- Le Grand Jacob,\r\nin the Bombay Journal (vol. iii. p. 206, _et seqq._), and other notices\r\nof them are found among Mr. Wathen’s inscriptions in various volumes of\r\nthe ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.’ But we shall not know more\r\nthan a fraction of what we ought to, and might know, till Sir Walter\r\nElliot’s inscriptions are translated and published.[718] When this is\r\ndone, and the architecture of the Nizam’s territory explored, the\r\nChalukyan style will take its place worthily between the Dravidian and\r\nIndo-Aryan styles, and will, if I mistake not, be found equal to either,\r\nboth in importance and in artistic merit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortunately there is no mistake or doubt about the era from which the\r\nChalukyan inscriptions are dated: the Ballabhi branch succeeding to the\r\npossessions of the Guptas in Gujerat, naturally adopted their era, but\r\nthe southern branch being entirely detached from any such association,\r\nadopted the Saka era (A.D. 79), which was then, so far as is known, the\r\nonly other era at that time in use in India. What is equally important\r\nis, that there seems only one doubtful date among all those quoted in\r\nthe lists--that of 411 Saka (A.D. 490), attached to the name of Pulakesi\r\nI. In his first paper,[719] Sir Walter Elliot thought it so improbable,\r\nthat he rejected it altogether; and Professor Eggeling tells me he has\r\nstrong reasons for suspecting the copperplate on which it is found to be\r\na forgery.\r\n\r\nAs an initial date it does not appear impossible, if my views are\r\ncorrect, though certainly improbable. If Bhatarka Senapati wrested\r\nGujerat from Skanda Gupta two years before his death, or in 463 or 468,\r\nit is by no means impossible that the fourth from him may have been\r\nreigning in A.D. 490, but the difficulty is the other way. There seems\r\nno doubt, from Mr. Burgess’s Badami inscriptions,[720] that Mangalisa\r\nsucceeded his brother Kirtti Varma in 567, and it does seem impossible\r\nthat he should have been the son of one who was reigning in 490,\r\nespecially if he continued to reign till 609. If Mangalisa was the son\r\nof Pulakesi, which there seems no reason for doubting, it is evident\r\nthat the central figure of his date must be altered to a higher number;\r\nbut to what extent we shall not know till it is ascertained whether\r\nVijaya was the son or grandson of Bhatarka Senapati. In the meanwhile,\r\nhowever, if we, as an hypothesis, add fifty years to the date of 411,\r\nand make it 461, or A.D. 540, it will allow Pulakesi a reign of\r\ntwenty-seven years before the accession of Mangalisa in 567, which will\r\nbring the whole within the limits of probability, and seems perfectly\r\nconsistent with the context.\r\n\r\nWith the seventh king we tread on surer ground. He was the king who,\r\nwhen bearing his grandfather’s name, Pulakesi, Hiouen Thsang visited in\r\n640,[721] and was, as his inscriptions tell us,[722] the hero of those\r\nwars with Harsha Verddhana, or Siladitya of Malwa, which Ma-twan-lin so\r\ngraphically describes as occurring in 618 to 627. From that time the\r\ndynasty seems to have flourished till the death of Vicramaditya II. He\r\nascended the throne 733, and died about 750, or twenty-five years more\r\nor less after the destruction of the Ballabhi branch. After this, as Sir\r\nWalter Elliot expresses it, “the power of the Chalukyas was alienated\r\nfor a time, or had suffered a partial obscuration, till the time of\r\nTeila, who is described as restoring the monarchy in 973.”[723] After\r\nthis it enjoyed two centuries of prosperity, till it was finally\r\nextinguished--their northern possessions passing to the\r\nKalabhuryas--their southern to the Hoisala Bellalas of Dwarasamudra or\r\nHullabîd.\r\n\r\nThe history of the younger branch of this family will be more\r\ninteresting to some future historian of Indian architecture than it is\r\nto us at the present day. Their possessions lay principally below the\r\nEastern Ghâts, on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, in what are generally\r\nknown as the three Circars, extending from Gangam--in their day I\r\nbelieve--to Mahavellipuram; but of their architecture we know nothing.\r\nNo traveller educated in architectural matters has yet visited that\r\ncountry; and though it sounds like a paradox to say so, what we do know\r\nof it we learn from buildings not erected by them, and in a country they\r\nnever seem to have possessed. It is only from the buildings of Pratapa\r\nRudra at Worangul and elsewhere above the Ghâts that we can appreciate\r\nthe perfection to which they had brought their style.\r\n\r\nFrom the meagre extracts from the inscriptions of Pulakesi I., which Sir\r\nWalter Elliot gives in his first essay on this subject,[724] there seems\r\nlittle doubt that he was the king who, 100 years before Hiouen Thsang’s\r\ntime, harried the monastery at Amravati,[725] and abolished Buddhism in\r\nthose parts. It seems also more than probable, as he conquered the\r\nChola, and burnt Conjeveram, that he also expelled the Pallavas, and\r\ncommenced the works at Mahavellipur. If the rock-cut monastery mentioned\r\nby Fa Hian and Hiouen Thsang, and so often referred to above, existed at\r\nall, it was in his territories, and may still exist in the Nizam’s. If\r\nit did so, nothing seems more probable than that he should seek to mark\r\nthe boundary of his southern conquest by similar works. Knowing all\r\nthis, we see also why there should be so much similarity between\r\nMangalisa’s cave at Badami, and the nearly contemporary caves at\r\nMahavellipur. We know, too, that there is a vast tract of country in\r\nCentral India, extending east and west from shore to shore, and north\r\nand south from Sadras to Ellora, which is covered with buildings of\r\ngreat beauty and interest, but which nobody cares to explore. We know\r\nalso that there exists in the Asiatic Society’s rooms a volume which\r\ncontains their history, and that of the dynasties who built them, but\r\nwhich nobody cares to read. Knowing how easily all this could be\r\nremedied, it is tantalising to close this history with so meagre a\r\nsketch of the Chalukyan style as that contained in the preceding pages,\r\nbut as the principles of the Indian Council seem fixed, its description\r\nmust in all probability be relegated to a subsequent generation.\r\n\r\n     UJJAIN AND CANOUGE DYNASTIES.\r\n------------------------------------+-------+------------\r\n                                    |REIGN. | DATE.\r\n                                    +-------+--------\r\nVasu Deva                           |       |\r\nVicramaditya I. of Ujjain           |   25  |   470?\r\nSri Harsha                          |   20  |   495?\r\nVicramaditya II. the Great          |   35  |   515\r\nSiladitya I. of Malwa               |   30  |   550\r\nPrabhukara                          |   25  |   580\r\nRaja Verddhana                      |    5  |   605\r\nSiladitya II. of Canouge            |   40  |   610\r\n        Died and troubles commenced |   --  | 648-650\r\n------------------------------------+-------+------------\r\n\r\nAlthough the Ballabhis wrested the province of Gujerat from the failing\r\nhands of Skanda, the last of the Great Guptas, two years before his\r\ndeath, in or about 470, they remained long in a subordinate position.\r\nTheir earliest inscription yet found dates only in 593, and their one\r\nEmperor or Raja Adhiraja, Sri Dharasena III., only ascended the throne\r\nafter the Canouge dynasty were struck down in 648-50.\r\n\r\nThe interval between these two events we are now happily able to fill up\r\nwith two of the most illustrious dynasties of India--the first including\r\nthe reign of the great Vicramaditya of Ujjain, who is to the Hindus what\r\nSolomon is to the Jews, or Asoka to the Buddhists. The last-named\r\nreligion, as mentioned above, was becoming effete about the middle of\r\nthe 5th century, and the Guptas were introducing the modern Brahmanical\r\nfaith in its place. What, however, they were only feebly attempting, the\r\nUjjain dynasty accomplished with a brilliancy that has eclipsed\r\neverything that happened before or since in India, in the eyes of the\r\nHindus at least. All that is great in science, or in poetry, or the\r\narts, shone forth around his wonderful throne--the exact counterpart of\r\nSolomon’s--and all that subsequently took place in India bears the stamp\r\nof his greatness. It seems, however, to have been too bright to last.\r\nThe four succeeding monarchs were Buddhists--of a singularly tolerant\r\ntype it is true--but still certainly favourers of that religion. The\r\nlast of them, Siladitya, was the king at whose court Hiouen Thsang\r\nsojourned in 636, and afterwards in 642, and where he witnessed the\r\nfestival of the distribution of alms so often alluded to above. Hiouen\r\nThsang gives the date of his death categorically, 650, and adds, though\r\nin the form of a prophecy, that after that, “l’Inde entière sera en\r\nproie à des troubles affreux--et des hommes pervers se feront une guerre\r\nacharnée.”[726] This is more than confirmed by Ma-twan-lin, but with an\r\napparent discrepancy of date, to the extent, it may be, of two\r\nyears.[727] It was in fact the commencement of those troubles which\r\nextinguished Buddhism, then in Central India, and a century later\r\nabolished it wholly, except in some remote corners of the land.\r\n\r\nWhether he died in 648 or 650, there is no doubt, from the numerous\r\nincidents our Chinese traveller recounts, that this Siladitya ascended\r\nthe throne 610, one year after his great rival, Pulakesi II., of Kalyan,\r\nwho, as pointed out above, began to reign in 609, and fought with him\r\nwith varying success in 618-627.\r\n\r\nFor the chronology of the four preceding reigns we have nothing but the\r\nassertion of Hiouen Thsang, that “suivant la tradition”[728]--and in\r\nanother place, “on lit dans l’histoire de ce royaume,[729] que le trône\r\nétait occupé il y a soixante ans par un roi nommé Siladitya;” and\r\nfurther, that he reigned fifty years, which would carry us back to 530\r\nfor the accession of this king, supposing the passage was written in\r\n640.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the confidence with which it is stated, I have no\r\nhesitation in rejecting as excessive 110 for the length of the reign of\r\nthree kings, two of whom were brothers. I do so with the more\r\nconfidence, as our author, though so exact a geographer, and recorder of\r\nthings he saw, is in no one instance to be depended upon for his dates.\r\nHe resided, for instance, for five years at Nalanda, and must have had\r\naccess to its records, yet he tells us that the convent existed for 700\r\nyears,[730] and then gives the names of the five kings by whom the\r\nvarious parts were built from that time to his day, but sees no\r\nabsurdity in representing these in all instances as the son of the one\r\nnext named previously. Each, according to his account, must have reigned\r\nmore than 100 years! To what extent this date of the accession of\r\nSiladitya must be curtailed can only be ascertained from subsequent\r\ndiscoveries or investigations. For the present it will suffice to\r\nabridge it by twenty years, which will bring it in accord with all that\r\nwe at present know from other sources.[731]\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the other end of our list, we have certainly\r\nthree--probably four kings--for whom we must find room in eighty years\r\nand one of the three, the great Vicramaditya, must have had a long\r\nreign. Professor Wilson ascribes to him thirty-five years,[732] and I\r\nknow of no authority better than his, especially for the history or\r\nchronology of this period. The Hindus themselves, with their usual\r\ncarelessness, have forgotten to record it; and though there are certain\r\ndates in the Puranas and elsewhere, there are no means of testing their\r\naccuracy; for his accession, however, there are one or two that are\r\nworth recording. Thus, Wilford reports that this Vicramaditya ascended\r\nthe throne of Malwa 441,[733] reckoning from the first of Salivahana,\r\nor, 520; or, according to the Agni Purana, 437 years after the same\r\nepoch, or 516,[734] which, I believe, may be the exact year; and there\r\nare several other dates which might be used to confirm this assumption,\r\nbut there are no means of testing the genuineness.\r\n\r\nAssuming this for the present, it leaves only forty-five years for the\r\ntwo or three preceding reigns; and it seems hardly sufficient for the\r\npurpose, for, as we shall presently see from the ‘Raja Tarangini,’ there\r\nwere nine descents between Pratapaditya, the friend of the first\r\nVicramaditya, and Matrigupta, the protégé of the second. Of course there\r\nmay be considerable overlapping among the first and last of these nine\r\nkings, but it seems impossible to compress the whole within a shorter\r\nperiod than has been allowed.\r\n\r\nHowever the small discrepancies of this dynasty may hereafter be\r\nadjusted, it is satisfactory to know that there is probably no date that\r\nwill admit of a greater correction than say ten years, if so much, and\r\nthe age of the last king, Hiouen Thsang’s friend, enables us to feel\r\nperfectly certain as to the dates of his son-in-law, Dhruvasena, of\r\nBallabhi, of Sasanka, of Pundra Verddhana, of Kumara, of Kamarupa, and\r\nof Pulakesi II. of Kalyan. We have thus at least one fixed point in our\r\nmediæval history which is quite certain, and from which we can calculate\r\nbackwards and forwards without difficulty, and is also an interesting\r\none, as its final date, 650, is the beginning of the end which was\r\nconsummated, as we shall see in the next section, by Laladitya just one\r\ncentury later.\r\n\r\n\r\nKASHMIR.\r\n\r\nAsoka, 276 to 240 B.C.\r\nJaloka.\r\nDamodara.\r\nHushka  }\r\nJushka  } Tartar Princes established Buddhism.\r\nKanishka}\r\nAbhimanu, 79 A.D.?\r\n\r\n          GONARDYA DYNASTY.\r\n\r\nGonarda.    _Naga worship restored._\r\nVibhishana.\r\nIndrajita.\r\nRavana.\r\nVibhishana.\r\nNara.\r\nSiddha.\r\nUtpalaksha.\r\nHiranyaksha.\r\nHiranyakula.\r\nVasukulo.\r\nMihirakula, invaded Ceylon 250?\r\nVaka.\r\n\r\nKshitinanda.\r\nVasunanda.\r\nNara.\r\nAksha.\r\nGopaditya, 330?\r\nGokarna.\r\nNarendraditya.\r\nYudhishthira.\r\n\r\n          ADITYA DYNASTY.\r\n\r\nPratapaditya, kinsman of Vicramaditya I., 390.\r\nJalaukas.\r\nTunjina.\r\nVijaya.\r\nJayendra.\r\nArya Raja.\r\n\r\n      GONARDYA LINE _restored_.\r\n\r\nMeghavahana invaded Ceylon, 472.\r\nPravarasena I.\r\nHiranya }\r\nToramana} Contemporaries of Vicramaditya.\r\nMatrigupta, viceroy under Vicramaditya II., 515.\r\nPravarasena II., invaded Siladitya of Gujerat, 560.\r\nYudhishthira II.\r\nNandravat.\r\nRanaditya.\r\nVikramaditya.\r\nBaladitya.\r\n\r\n      NAGA OR KARKOTA DYNASTY.\r\n\r\nDurlabhaverddhana, 627.\r\nPratapaditya, 663.\r\nChandrapira, 713.\r\nParapira, 721.\r\nLalataditya, 725; died 761.

Some of the few events it narrates are interesting and\r\nimportant, but they lose much of their value from the chronology to\r\nwhich they are attached being wilfully and systematically falsified.\r\nEven they, however, may become more valuable than they now appear, when\r\nthe work is better edited than it has been hitherto. The earliest and\r\nbest account we have of it is that of Professor Wilson, in the fifteenth\r\nvolume of the ‘Asiatic Researches.’ The translation, afterwards\r\npublished by Troyer in French, is fuller, no doubt, but is made from a\r\nless perfect manuscript, and is far less critical. Dr. Geo. Bühler, who\r\nis now in the valley, is said to have collected several additional and\r\nmore complete MSS., from which it is understood he is preparing a new\r\nedition of the work. When this is done, we may be able to use it more\r\nprofitably; meanwhile, for chronological purposes, we can only try and\r\nfind an initial and final date, and with one or two intermediate\r\nsynchronisms, try to bring the whole into an intelligible sequence; but\r\nso hopelessly is the chronology confused by its author, that this at\r\npresent can only be effected by the application of a system of averages,\r\nwhich is, and always must be, a most unsatisfactory mode of procedure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRejecting at once as worthless or hopelessly lost all those parts of the\r\nhistory before the third century B.C., the first name we come to is the\r\nfamiliar one of Asoka, but here placed 1394 B.C., or more than 1000\r\nyears too early. It was in order to recover what was lost by this first\r\nerror that Kalhana Pandit was forced to falsify all the dates up to the\r\naccession of the Karkota dynasty (A.D. 627), when they were known, even\r\nin his day, as certain within ten or twenty years. To effect this, he\r\nadded ten, twenty, or thirty years here and there, as caprice dictated,\r\ntill at last, losing patience, he gave one king, Ranaditya, in the 6th\r\ncentury, 300 years, instead of a possible thirty, and so made both ends\r\nmeet! So history is written in the East!\r\n\r\nAfter Asoka’s, the next name we meet in the lists with which we are\r\nfamiliar is that of Kanishka, and he plays so important a part in the\r\nhistory of Kashmir and Gandhara, that it would be of extreme interest if\r\nhis date could be fixed with even approximate certainty. The ‘Raja\r\nTarangini’ gives us no help in this matter. Generally, it has been\r\nassumed, principally on numismatic evidence, that he reigned either\r\nimmediately before or immediately after the Christian Era;[735] but\r\nbetween him and Asoka our lists afford only two names. If, therefore, we\r\nare to apply to this history the same logic the very learned have\r\nattempted to apply to dates of the Nirvana in the ‘Mahawanso,’ we must\r\neither bring down Asoka to the first century B.C., or take back Kanishka\r\nto the third. As neither process is admissible, nothing remains to be\r\ndone but to admit that the record is imperfect, and that it is only from\r\nexternal evidence that these dates can be fixed with anything like\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nEven admitting that Hushka and Jushka were the father and grandfather of\r\nKanishka, which I am inclined to think may be the case, instead of his\r\nbrothers, as is usually supposed, it will hardly help us much--four\r\nreigns of insignificant princes in 200 years is nearly equally\r\ninadmissible, and will not help us to fix Kanishka’s date from Asoka’s.\r\n\r\nRecently the question has been very much narrowed by the discovery of a\r\nnumber of dated inscriptions at Muttra and elsewhere, in which the name\r\nof Kanishka and his successor Huvishka frequently occur--the latter\r\nalways following, never preceding, the former name. It is this that\r\nmakes me believe that the Hushka of the chronicle was the father of\r\nKanishka, and nothing in that case is so probable as that his successor\r\nshould take his grandfather’s name. It is almost impossible he should\r\ntake his uncle’s, and as the name of Jushka appears nowhere in the\r\ninscriptions, it is natural to assume that he had passed away some time\r\nbefore they were written.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the following table gives the inscriptions as they\r\nwere found by General Cunningham:[736]--\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Indo-Pali Alphabet._\r\n\r\n          { KANISHKA.

Their purport, however, and the form of the characters used, he\r\nconsiders sufficient to show that they form a connected series dating\r\nfrom one and the same era, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we have an era, which we may safely assume was\r\nestablished by Kanishka, either from the beginning of his reign, or to\r\nmark some important event in it, and which was used after his time for\r\ntwo or three centuries at least. The question is, was that the era since\r\nknown as that of Vicramaditya, dating from 56 B.C., or was it the Saka\r\nera of King Salivahana, dating 135 years after that? General Cunningham\r\nunhesitatingly adopts the former; and though it is not a subject to\r\ndogmatise upon, I am much more inclined to adopt the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, because I can find no trace of any such era being in\r\nuse before the cataclysm in A.D. 750. Bhau Daji states that he knows no\r\ninscription dated in it before the 11th century.[737] General Cunningham\r\nsays it was not used as early as 826,[738] but, in another place, quotes\r\nan inscription in 754.[739] I know of none earlier; and can trace no\r\nallusion to any king of the name of Vicramaditya in the first century\r\nB.C., and no events that could have given rise to an era in 56 B.C. No\r\ntrace of it is found in Thibet, in Burmah, or Cambodia, and it never was\r\nheard of in Ceylon or Java. In all these countries the Saka era is known\r\nand was used, and it seems strange that an era established by so\r\npowerful a Buddhist king as Kanishka should have endured for two or\r\nthree centuries, and then perished, without leaving a trace in any\r\nBuddhist country, and then, after the 8th century, been revived and\r\nadopted by the Brahmans for their chronology. It may be so; but it is so\r\nstrange, it seems to require some strong evidence to make it credible,\r\nand none such has yet been advanced.\r\n\r\nHitherto Kanishka’s date has been assumed almost wholly on numismatic\r\nevidence, but it seems to me without sufficient grounds. In all the\r\nlists hitherto published,[740] there are at least a dozen barbarian\r\nkings, several of whom, from the extent of their mintages, must have had\r\nlong and prosperous reigns. To compress the whole into the sixty-four\r\nyears that elapsed for the destruction of the Bactrian kingdom (120\r\nB.C.), and the era of Vicramaditya (56 B.C.), seems to me a very strong\r\nmeasure, for which I can see no justification. To allow each, on an\r\naverage, sixteen years’ reign, seems very much more probable, especially\r\nas many more names may yet be discovered--and even without them this\r\nwould take us on to the Saka era (A.D. 79) without difficulty. One of\r\nthem, Gondophares, as we shall presently see, reigned for twenty-six\r\nyears at least.\r\n\r\nThe Roman consular coins found by M. Court, above referred to (_ante_,\r\np. 79), were so worn as to be hardly legible, and though, therefore,\r\nthey limit the antiquity of his reign certainly to this side of 44 B.C.,\r\nthey by no means prove that he was so early. On the contrary, the coins\r\nbeing worn, seems to prove that they were old before being buried; the\r\nprobability is that they may have belonged to some pilgrim, or\r\nmissionary, in the West, and had become sacred relics before they were\r\nenshrined. If Kanishka had merely wanted foreign coins, Greek or Roman,\r\nhe might have had hundreds of perfect ones at his command. There must\r\nhave been some other and holier motive for their deposit than merely to\r\nmark a date.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the legend of St. Thomas the Apostle visiting the\r\ncourt of Gondophares, and, some add, being beheaded by his order. It may\r\nbe a legend, and not one word of truth in it, but those who invented it\r\nin the second or third century must at least have had the means of\r\nknowing what was the name of the king who was on the throne of Gandhara\r\nat, or immediately after, the time of the Crucifixion. This name appears\r\nfrequently on coins and inscriptions, and, from the numismatic evidence,\r\nhas been placed by all as anterior to Kanishka, and I fancy that no one\r\nlooking at the coins can well arrive at any other conclusion. If this is\r\nso, and he was reigning at any time between A.D. 33 and 50, Kanishka\r\ncertainly belongs to the latter half of that century.\r\n\r\nAgainst this it must be stated that both General Cunningham and\r\nProfessor Dowson read an inscription of this king found at Takht-i-Bahi,\r\nas dated in his twenty-sixth year--one says in the 103rd,[741] the other\r\n100th,[742] of the same Samvat as the inscription of Kanishka--a date\r\nwhich would answer perfectly for the legend. If this is so, there is an\r\nend of the controversy; but the stone is so worn, and the writing so\r\nindistinct, that I cannot see in the photographs of it what these\r\ngentlemen find there, and others are equally unable to do so; and\r\nbesides this, it is such a wrench to all numismatic evidence to place\r\nthe coins of Gondophares 100 years after those of Kanishka, that we must\r\nhave more evidence than this imperfect inscription affords before we\r\nadopt its epochal date. The regnal date seems quite clear.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point of view from which this question may be\r\nregarded, but which it is difficult to express clearly without going to\r\na greater length than our limits will admit of. It is the date of the\r\nthird convocation, as the northern Buddhists call it--the fourth,\r\naccording to the southern. It was held certainly under Kanishka’s\r\nauspices, and I cannot help fancying about the year 70 or 80 A.D. At\r\nthat time, at least, Buddhism seems to have made a great stride in\r\nThibet, in Burmah, and the East generally. It was about this time that\r\nit was fabled to have been first carried to Java, and about the time\r\nwhen it was first introduced in China.[743] It looks so like one of\r\nthose outbursts of missionary zeal that followed all the three previous\r\nconvocations, that I cannot help fancying that this one was held in the\r\nlatter half of the first century, and that the era of the king who held\r\nit was allowed in all Buddhist countries to supersede that of the\r\nNirvana, which, as far as I can see, was the only one that had existed\r\npreviously in India.\r\n\r\nTo argue this out fully would require more space than its importance for\r\narchitectural purposes would justify; but its bearing on the age of the\r\nGandhara monasteries is in some respects considerable. If they are as\r\nmodern as I suspect them to be, the more modern date for Kanishka would\r\naccord better with the known facts than carrying his date up before the\r\nChristian era.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProceeding onward, the next name we come to of any importance is\r\nMahiracula, who is said to have invaded Ceylon. There is, however, no\r\ntrace of any such invasion at that time, which, by the application of\r\naverages would be about 180 A.D., if Kanishka ruled before, and 250 if\r\nafter, the Christian Era. His date would be interesting if it could be\r\nascertained from his connexion with Baladitya, the king of Magadha,\r\nwhose story Hiouen Thsang tells in such minute detail.[744]\r\n\r\nThe Aditya dynasty opens with a king who is said to have been a kinsman\r\nof Vicramaditya, and is evidently the grandfather of the great king of\r\nthat name, who figures prominently in the next dynasty as the patron of\r\nMatrigupta. The story of the latter is told in great detail in the ‘Raja\r\nTarangini,’ and is one of the most curious episodes in the history. He\r\nwas sent to Kashmir four years before the death of Vicramaditya (550),\r\nand on hearing of his patron’s decease, resigned his viceroyalty, and\r\nretired to Benares, leaving the throne to his successor, Pravarasena.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the dynasty of Malwa, only twenty or twenty-five years\r\nwere allowed for the reign of Sri Harsha, and only eighty for the whole\r\nduration, from the fall of the Guptas, 470, to the death of the great\r\nVicramaditya, 550, a period, it seems from the evidence of the ‘Raja\r\nTarangini,’ it is impossible to contract. Pratapaditya, the kinsman of\r\nthe first, was, we are told, the great-grandfather of Megavahana, the\r\nfirst king of the next dynasty, and then we have one more king before we\r\nreach Hiranya, who is said to have been contemporary with the second\r\nVicramaditya. Of course there may have been considerable overlapping at\r\nboth ends, and the lives of the Kashmiri kings may have been short; but\r\nas we have six intermediate kings in the one list between the two\r\nVicramadityas, and only one in the other, it seems that the last could\r\nhardly have ascended the throne before 515, if so early.\r\n\r\nOne of the acts of Pravarasena was to invade Siladitya, the first\r\nBallabhi king of that name ruling in Gujerat. We have not, it is true,\r\nany dated coins or inscriptions belonging to him, but we have of his\r\nnext successor but one, Sri Dharasena II., 593 (_ante_, p. 730), so that\r\nany date between 550 and 570 would answer perfectly well for this war,\r\nand the fact of its being so is in itself almost sufficient to establish\r\nthe correctness of the chronology we are now trying to explain.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote last on the subject, a passage has been pointed out to\r\nme[745] in Rémusat’s ‘Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques’ (vol. i. p. 197),\r\nwhich enables us to fix the chronology of the Naga dynasty within a year\r\nor two for extreme deviation. It seems that the third king, Chandrapira,\r\napplied to the Chinese Emperor for assistance against the Arabs in 713,\r\nand that the Emperor conferred the title of King on him in or about 720.\r\nAs he was on the throne only eight years and eight months, there is no\r\nroom for deviation in this date, and it carries with it those of his\r\npredecessors and followers. It thus becomes clear that Durlabha I. was\r\nthe king who was on the throne when Hiouen Thsang resided in the valley,\r\n631-633, and also when he passed near it on his return home in 643, all\r\nwhich is perfectly consonant with what we find in his text; and it also\r\nfixes the date of Lalitaditya, one of the most important kings in the\r\nlist, with almost absolute certainty, as 725-762.[746]\r\n\r\nWithout placing implicit reliance on all that is said in the ‘Raja\r\nTarangini,’ with regard to the exploits of this king, or of his having\r\noverrun and conquered all India, from beyond the Himalayas to Cape\r\nComorin, still a sufficient residuum of fact must remain to enable us to\r\nsee that the troubles which had begun in 650, on the death of Siladitya\r\nof Canouge, had laid India prostrate at the feet of any daring\r\nadventurer.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side we approach it, we can hardly fail to perceive that a\r\ngreat revolution took place in India about the year 750. All the old\r\ndynasties are then swept away, and for 200 years we have nothing but\r\ndarkness, and when light again dawns, about two centuries afterwards,\r\nthe map is re-arranged, and new dynasties and new religions have taken\r\nthe place of the old.\r\n\r\nThis reign, too, forms a most appropriate termination to the principal\r\ndivision of our architectural history. The coins of his rival,\r\nYasoverman of Canouge, found in the great Tope at Manikyala, prove the\r\ncompletion of that great Buddhist monument, just 1000 years after the\r\nstyle had been inaugurated by the great Asoka, and in that thousand\r\nyears all that is important in Buddhist architecture is included. The\r\nfact, too, of his being the builder of the great Naga temple at\r\nMarttand, the earliest, so far as I know, in Kashmir, marks the\r\ncommencement of a new architectural era, the fruits of which we see when\r\nthe curtain again rises. The Jaina religion, with its new style of\r\ntemples, had entirely replaced Buddhist forms over the greater part of\r\nIndia, and the Vaishnava and Saiva religions reigned supreme everywhere\r\nelse, in the forms in which we now find them, after the lapse of nearly\r\nanother 1000 years’ duration. As, however, there are no chronological\r\ndifficulties with regard to these later dynasties, the discussion of the\r\ndates of the kings’ reigns who built them has evidently no place in this\r\nAppendix.[747]\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF VICRAMADITYA.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this Appendix, I would like to be allowed to explain\r\nan hypothesis which, if it can be sustained, not only clears up what has\r\nhitherto been a great mystery, but gets rid of a quantity of rubbish\r\nwhich obscures the chronology of the period. It does not, however, alter\r\nany date, nor affect them further than, if true, it confirms some,\r\nwhich, if it prove groundless, are deprived of its support.\r\n\r\nNo one has yet been able to point to the name of Vicramaditya as\r\nbelonging to any king in the first century B.C., or to any event likely\r\nto give rise to an era being dated from it.[748] What, then, was the\r\norigin of the era dating from 56 B.C., and how did it arise and obtain\r\nits name?\r\n\r\nMy belief is that the solution of the mystery will be found in a passage\r\nin Albiruni, the meaning of which he did not profess to understand,\r\ncombined with two or three passages in the ‘Raja Tarangini.’\r\n\r\nThe passage in Albiruni is to the following effect:--“L’ère de Saca,\r\nnommée par les Indiens Sacakala, est postérieure à celle de Vicramaditya\r\nde 135 ans. Saca est le nom d’un prince qui a régné sur les contrées\r\nsituées entre l’Indus et la mer (le Golfe du Bengale). Sa résidence\r\nétait placée au centre de l’Empire (Muttra?), dans la contrée nommée\r\nAryavartha. Les Indiens le font naître dans une classe autre que celle\r\ndes (Kchatrias?): quelques-uns prétendent qu’il était Soudra et\r\noriginaire de la ville de Mansoura. Il y en a même qui disent qu’il\r\nn’était pas de race indienne, et qu’il tirait son origine des régions\r\noccidentales. Les peuples eurent beaucoup à souffrir de son despotisme,\r\njusqu’à ce qu’il leur vînt du secours de l’Orient. Vicramaditya marcha\r\ncontre lui, mit son armée en déroute, et le tua sur le territoire de\r\nKorour, situé entre Moultan et le Château de Louny. Cette époque devint\r\ncélèbre, à cause de la joie que les peuples ressentirent de la mort de\r\nSaca, et on la choisit pour ère, principalement chez les\r\nastronomes.”[749]\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to apply this narrative to any events happening in\r\nthe first century B.C., not to mention the inherent absurdity of\r\nVicramaditya establishing an era 56 B.C., and then 135 years afterwards\r\ndefeating the Saka king on the banks of the Indus. If it meant anything,\r\nit might point to the origin of the Saka era, not that of Vicramaditya.\r\n\r\nTurning from this to the ‘Raja Tarangini,’ we find the following\r\npassages in Troyer’s translation:--\r\n\r\n“Ayant fait venir ensuite, d’un autre pays, Pratapaditya, parent du roi\r\nVicramaditya, ils le sacrèrent souverain de l’Empire.\r\n\r\n“D’autres induits en erreur ont écrit que ce Vicramaditya fut le même\r\nqui combattit les Çakas; mais cette version est rejetée.”[750]\r\n\r\nA little further on we have: “Dans le même temps--the death of\r\nHiranya--l’heureux Vicramaditya, appelé d’un autre nom Harcha, réunit\r\ncomme empereur à Udjdjayini l’Empire de l’Inde sous un seul parasol....\r\n\r\n“Employant la fortune comme moyen d’utilité, il fit fleurir les talents:\r\nc’est ainsi qu’encore aujourd’hui les hommes de talent se trouvent la\r\ntête haute au milieu des riches.\r\n\r\n“Ayant d’abord détruit les Çakas, il rendit léger le fardeau de l’œuvre\r\nde Hari, qui doit descendre sur la terre pour exterminer les\r\nMletchhas.”[751]\r\n\r\nBefore going further, it may be as well to point out what appears to be\r\na fair inference from the above. That the first Vicramaditya, the friend\r\nof Pratapaditya, was so near in date to the second--he, in fact, appears\r\nto have been his grandfather--as to be confounded with him, and to have\r\nthe name of Sakari applied to him, which in fact belonged to his\r\ngrandson, the real destroyer of the Sakas.\r\n\r\nMy conviction is, that these paragraphs refer to one and the same event;\r\nand, assuming that the battle of Korûr was fought 544--the year before\r\nVicramaditya sent Matrigupta to be his viceroy in Kashmir--what I\r\nbelieve happened was this: Some time after 750, when the Hindus were\r\nremodelling their history and their institutions, so as to mark their\r\nvictory over the Buddhists, they determined on establishing two eras,\r\nwhich should be older than that of the Buddhists, A.D. 79, and for this\r\npurpose instituted one, ten cycles of sixty years each, before the\r\nbattle of Korûr, and called it by the name of the hero of that battle,\r\nthe most illustrious of their history; the other ten centuries, or 1000\r\nyears before the same date, and called it by the name of his father, Sri\r\nHarsha--a title he himself often bore in conjunction with his own\r\nname--the first consequently dated for 56 B.C., the second from 456. It\r\nneed hardly be added that no Sri Harsha existed in the fifth century\r\nB.C., any more than a Vicramaditya in the first.\r\n\r\nThe co-existence of these eras may be gathered from the following\r\npassage in Albiruni:--\r\n\r\n“On emploie ordinairement les ères de Sri Harscha, de Vicramaditya, de\r\nSaca, de Ballabha, et des Gouptas.” “D’après cela, en s’en tenant à l’an\r\n400 de l’ère de Yezderdjed, on se trouve sous l’année 1488 de l’ère de\r\nSri Harscha--l’an 1088 de l’ère de Vicramaditya--l’an 953 de l’ère de\r\nSaca--l’an 712 de l’ère de Ballabha, et de celle des Gouptas (A.D.\r\n1032).”--‘Journal Asiatique,’ series iv. vol. iv. pp. 280, 286.\r\n\r\nThe Sri Harsha era, exactly 400 years before that of Vicramaditya, was\r\navowedly conventional, and seems never to have come into use, and no\r\nfurther mention is made of it afterwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this view of the matter can be sustained, the advantage will be not\r\nonly that the date of the battle of Korûr, and of the expulsion of the\r\nSakas, Hunas, Yavanas, &c., from India will be fixed with mathematical\r\nprecision in 544, but that one of the greatest mysteries connected with\r\nthe history of the period will be cleared up, and the revival of the\r\nHindu religion relegated to a much later period. If, on the other hand,\r\nit can be shown that this view of the matter is not tenable, we shall\r\nlose these advantages, but it will require a great deal more than that\r\nto prove that Vicramaditya, or any Hindu king, reigned in the first\r\ncentury B.C. Buddhism was then in its palmiest state, and there is no\r\ntrace of the Hindu religion then existing, and the expulsion of Sakas,\r\nYavanas, and Hunas did not take place for long afterwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, having now cursorily run through the whole\r\nchronology, in so far as it admits of controversy, I feel very\r\nconfident, on a calm review of the whole, that none of the important\r\ndates quoted above can be disturbed to a greater extent than say ten, or\r\nat the utmost twenty years--except, perhaps, that of Kanishka. From the\r\nAnjana epoch, 691 B.C., to the death of Lalitaditya, A.D. 761, all seems\r\nnow tolerably clear and fixed, and, with a very little industry, minor\r\nblemishes might easily be swept away. If this were done, the chronology\r\nof mediæval India for the Buddhist period might be considered as fixed\r\non a secure and immoveable basis of ascertained facts. The advantages of\r\nthis being done can hardly be over-estimated for improving our knowledge\r\nof India generally, while, among other things, it would give a precision\r\nand solidity to all our speculations about that country, which, for want\r\nof it, have hitherto been generally so vague and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nThe following are the last of the twenty-four Buddhas, beginning with\r\nDipankara I., who appeared to instruct and enlighten mankind, and to\r\nwhom Sakya Muni succeeds in the present Kalpa:\r\n\r\n22.

ed. Murray, 1867.\r\n\r\n[2] ‘History of Architecture,’ vol. ii. pp. 445-756, Woodcuts 966-1163.\r\n\r\n[3] A distinguished German professor, Herr Kinkel of Zürich, in his\r\n‘Mosaik zur Kunstgeschichte, Berlin, 1876,’ has lately adopted my views\r\nwith regard to the age of Stonehenge without any reservation, though\r\narriving at that conclusion by a very different chain of reasoning from\r\nthat I was led to adopt.\r\n\r\n[4] The following brief résumé of the principal events in the ancient\r\nhistory of India has no pretensions to being a complete or exhaustive\r\nview of the subject. It is intended only as such a popular sketch\r\nas shall enable the general reader to grasp the main features of\r\nthe story to such an extent as may enable him to understand what\r\nfollows. In order to make it readable, all references and all proofs\r\nof disputed facts have been postponed. They will be found in the body\r\nof the work, where they are more appropriate, and the data on which\r\nthe principal disputed dates are fixed will be found in an Appendix\r\nespecially devoted to their discussion. Unfortunately no book exists\r\nto which the reader could with advantage be referred; and without some\r\nsuch introductory notice of the political history and ethnography the\r\nartistic history would be nearly, if not wholly, unintelligible.\r\n\r\n[5] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. i.\r\n\r\n[6] Almost the only person who has of late done anything in this\r\ndirection is Sir Walter Elliot. His papers in the ‘Journal of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society’ and the ‘Madras Journal’ throw immense light on the\r\nsubject, but to complete the task we want many workers instead of only\r\none.\r\n\r\n[7] All this has been so fully gone into by me in my work on ‘Tree and\r\nSerpent Worship,’ pp. 63, _et seqq._, that it will not be necessary to\r\nrepeat it here.\r\n\r\n[8] Dr. Caldwell, the author of the ‘Dravidian Grammar,’ is the\r\ngreatest and most trustworthy advocate of this view.\r\n\r\n[9] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ pp. 244-247.\r\n\r\n[10] In Arrian there is a curious passage which seems certainly to\r\nrefer to this people. “During the space,” he says, “of 6042 years in\r\nwhich the 153 monarchs reigned, the Indians had the liberty of being\r\ngoverned by their own laws only twice, once for about 200 years, and\r\nafter that for about 120 years.”--‘Indica,’ ch. ix. The Puranas, as may\r\nbe supposed, do not help us to identify these two periods.\r\n\r\n[11] I cannot help fancying that they occupied some part of southern\r\nIndia, and even Ceylon, before the arrival of the Dravidians. It seems\r\ndifficult otherwise to account for the connection between Behar and\r\nCeylon in early ages, and the spread of Buddhism in that island leaping\r\nover the countries which had been Dravidianised.\r\n\r\n[12] I cannot help suspecting that the Gonds also belong to this\r\nnorthern race. It is true they speak a language closely allied to the\r\nTamil; but language, though invaluable as a guide, is nearly useless\r\nas a test of affinity. The Romans imposed their language on all the\r\ndiverse nationalities of Italy, France, and Spain. We have imposed ours\r\non the Cornish, and are fast teaching the Irish, Welsh, and Highlanders\r\nof Scotland to abandon their tongue for ours, and the process is\r\nrapidly going on elsewhere. The manners and customs of the Gonds are\r\nall similar to those of the Coles or Khonds, though, it is true, they\r\nspeak a Dravidian tongue.\r\n\r\n[13] The most pleasing of the histories of Buddha, written wholly from\r\na European point of view, is that of Barthélemy St. Hilaire, Paris. Of\r\nthose partially native, partly European, are those of Bishop Bigandet,\r\nfrom the Burmese legends, and the ‘Romantic History of Buddha,’\r\ntranslated from the Chinese by the Rev. S. Beal. The ‘Lalita Vistara,’\r\ntranslated by Foucaud, is more modern than these, and consequently more\r\nfabulous and absurd.\r\n\r\n[14] There may possibly be an error of forty to sixty years in this\r\ndate; but, on the whole, that here given is supported by the greatest\r\namount of concurrent testimony, and may, after all, prove to be\r\nminutely correct.\r\n\r\n[15] ‘Foé Koué Ki,’ xxv. ch. 11; ‘Mahawanso,’ v. p. 20; ‘Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. 527.\r\n\r\n[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne coin at least of the period is well known. It belongs to a king\r\ncalled Kunanda or Krananda, generally assumed to be one of the nine\r\nNandas with whom this dynasty closed. In the centre, on one side, is\r\na Dagoba with the usual Buddhist Trisul emblem over it, and a serpent\r\nbelow it; on the right the Sacred Tree, on the left a Swastica with\r\nan altar? on the other side a lady with a lotus (Sri?) with an animal\r\nusually called a deer, but from its tail more probably a horse, with\r\ntwo serpents standing on their tails over its head, which have been\r\nmistaken for horns. Over the animal is an altar, with an umbrella over\r\nit. In fact, a complete epitome of emblems known on the monuments of\r\nthe period, but savouring much more of Tree and Serpent worship than of\r\nBuddhism, as it is now known. ‘Journal of the Koyal Asiatic Society,’\r\nvol. i. (N.S.) p. 447, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[17] All these particulars, it need hardly be said, are taken from\r\nthe 12th and 15th chapters of the ‘Mahawanso,’ confirmed by the\r\ninscriptions themselves and the relics found at Sanchi, to all which\r\nreference will be made hereafter.\r\n\r\n[18] Wilson’s ‘Hindu Drama,’ vol. xii. p. 151, _et seqq._, edition 1871.\r\n\r\n[19] Lassen, it is true, brings these dates down by ten years below\r\nwhere I have placed it. But he overlooks the fact that according to his\r\nhypothesis Asoka, in the sixteenth year of his reign, would claim Magas\r\nas his ally ten or twelve years after his death, which is improbable.\r\n\r\n[20] For complete details of these two monuments and the dates,\r\nthe reader is referred to my ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ which is\r\npractically devoted to a description of these two monuments.\r\n\r\n[21] ‘Vie et Voyages de Hiouen Thsang,’ i. p. 215. It need hardly\r\nbe said that all these particulars are taken from the three volumes\r\nrelating his Indian experiences, translated by Stanislas Julien.\r\n\r\n[22] This does not apply to Orissa, which, from its remote situation,\r\nand having at that time no resident Buddhist population, seems to have\r\nescaped being drawn into the vortex of these troubles.\r\n\r\n[23] The best and most accepted account of these events is found in\r\nVivien de St. Martin’s ‘Les Huns blancs,’ Paris, 1849.\r\n\r\n[24] Cunningham’s ‘Numismatic Chron.,’ viii. 175; ‘Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal,’ vii. 704; Lassen’s ‘Indische Alterth.,’ ii.\r\np. 24.\r\n\r\n[25] I wrote a paper stating the evidence in favour of this last view,\r\nwhich I intended should appear in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society.’\r\nThe evidence being, however, incomplete, it has only been printed for\r\nprivate circulation.\r\n\r\n[26] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. viii.\r\np. 28.\r\n\r\n[27] Ibid., vol. v. p. 42.\r\n\r\n[28] The argument on which these assertions are founded is stated at\r\nlength in the privately printed pamphlet alluded to on preceding page.\r\nIt is too long to insert here, but, if not published before this work\r\nis complete, an abstract will be inserted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[29] ‘Journal of the Koyal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii. p. 202.\r\n\r\n[30] For an exhaustive description of this subject see Priaulx, ‘India\r\nand Rome,’ London, 1873. My own impressions are, I confess, entirely in\r\nfavour of the northern origin of the embassy. We are now in a position\r\nto prove an intimate connection between the north of India and Rome at\r\nthat time. With the south it seems to have been only trade, but of this\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n[31] ‘Dravidian Grammar,’ second edition, London, 1875, p. 129, _et\r\nseqq._\r\n\r\n[32] Sir Walter Elliot and others frequently speak of Buddhist\r\nmonuments in the south. I have never, however, been able to see\r\na photograph or drawing of any one except at Amravati and its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[33] In his ‘Elements of South Indian Palæography,’ Mr. Burnell, the\r\nlast and best authority on the subject, divides the South Indian\r\nalphabet into Chera, Chalukya, and Vengi. The first, he states, appears\r\nin Mysore in the second half of the 5th century. The oldest specimen of\r\nthe second he dates from the first half of that century. The third is\r\nmore modern.\r\n\r\n[34] I am, of course, aware of the existence of a so-called Buddhist\r\npagoda at Negapatam. It was, however, utilised by the British--for\r\nrailway purposes, I believe--before it was photographed, so its history\r\nmay for ever remain a mystery. On the spot it was apparently known as\r\nthe Jaina (hence China) pagoda, which it may have been. To me it looks\r\nlike the gopura of a small Hindu temple, but I have no real knowledge\r\non the subject. See Yule’s ‘Marco Polo,’ vol. ii. p. 320, second\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[35] ‘Storia della Scultura, dal suo risorgimento in Italia sino al\r\nsecolo di Napoleone,’ Venezia, 1813.\r\n\r\n[36] “The ritual of the Veda is chiefly, if not wholly, addressed\r\nto the elements, particularly to fire.”--H. H. Wilson, ‘Asiatic\r\nResearches,’ xvii. p. 194; ibid., p. 614.\r\n\r\n[37] A list of the twenty-four Buddhas, with these particulars,\r\nis given in the introduction to Tumour’s ‘Mahawanso,’ p. 32.\r\nRepresentations of six or seven of these Bodhi-trees, with the names\r\nattached, have been found at Bharhut, showing at least that more than\r\nfour were recognised in the time of Asoka. If the rail there were\r\nentire, it is probable representations of the whole might be found.\r\n\r\n[38] Stobæus, ‘Physica,’ Gaisford’s edition, p. 54. See also Priaulx,\r\n‘India and Rome,’ p. 153.\r\n\r\n[39] Wilson’s ‘Ariana Antiqua,’ plates 10, 11.\r\n\r\n[40] A book has recently been published by the late Mr. Breeks, of the\r\nMadras Civil Service, on the primitive tribes of the Nilagiris, which\r\ngives a fuller account of these ‘rude stone monuments’ than any other\r\nyet given to the public. It can hardly, however, be accepted as a\r\nsolution of the problem, which requires a wider survey than he was able\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n[41] The serpent of Siva is always a cobra, or poisonous snake, and\r\nused by him as an awe-inspiring weapon, a very different animal from\r\nthe many-headed tutelary Naga, the guardian angel of mankind, and\r\nregarded only with feelings of love and veneration by his votaries. It\r\nmay also be remarked that no tree is appropriated to Siva, and no trace\r\nof tree worship mingled with the various forms of adoration paid to\r\nthis divinity--a circumstance in itself quite sufficient to distinguish\r\nthis form of faith from that of the Dasyu group which pervaded the\r\nvalley of the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[42] Page 41. Dr. Cornish, in the introduction to the ‘Madras\r\nStatistical Tables,’ p. 67, states this at only 30,000,000--a very\r\nconsiderable difference; but on the whole I am inclined to place faith\r\nin Dr. Caldwell’s figures.\r\n\r\n[43] ‘Madras Report,’ p. 90.\r\n\r\n[44] These remarks must not be taken as applying to sculpture also.\r\nIt is quite true that no stone sculptures have yet been found in\r\nIndia of an earlier date than the age of Asoka; but, as will be\r\nseen in the sequel, the perfection the Indian artists had attained\r\nin stone sculpture when they executed the bas-reliefs at\r\nBharhut (B.C. 200), shows a familiarity with the material that\r\ncould only be attained by long practice.\r\n\r\n[45] No mention of temples, or, indeed, of buildings is, I believe,\r\nfound in the Vedas, and though both are frequently alluded to, and\r\ndescribed in the Epic Poems and the Puranas, this hardly helps us;\r\nfirst because, like all verbal descriptions of buildings, they are\r\ntoo vague to be intelligible, and secondly, because there is no proof\r\nthat the passages containing these descriptions may not have been\r\ninterpolated after--probably long after--the Christian Era.\r\n\r\n[46] I believe I was the first to ascertain these facts from a personal\r\ninspection of the monuments themselves. They were communicated to the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society in a paper I read on the ‘Rock-cut Temples of\r\nIndia,’ in 1842. Every subsequent research, and every increase of our\r\nknowledge, has tended to confirm those views to such an extent that\r\nthey are not now disputed by any one acquainted with the literature of\r\nthe subject, though some writers do still indulge in rhapsodies about\r\nthe primæval antiquity of the caves, and their connection with those\r\nof Egypt, &c. Till all this is put on one side, no clear idea can be\r\nobtained of the true position of the art in India.\r\n\r\n[47] From two Sanscrit words, Dhatu, a relic, and Garbha (Pali,\r\nGabbhan), the womb, receptacle, shrine of a relic. (Turnour,\r\n‘Mahawanso,’ p. 5.) The word Pagoda is probably a corruption of Dagoba.\r\n\r\n[48] In Nepal, according to Hodgson, and, I believe, in Thibet, the\r\nmonuments which are called Stupas in India are there called Chaityas.\r\nEtymologically, this is no doubt the correct designation, as Chaitya,\r\nlike Stupa, means primarily a heap or tumulus, but it also means a\r\nplace of sacrifice or religious worship--an altar from Chíta, a heap,\r\nan assemblage, a multitude, &c. (Monier Williams’ ‘Sanscrit Dictionary’\r\n_sub voce_). Properly speaking, therefore, these caves ought perhaps to\r\nbe called “halls containing a chaitya,” or “chaitya halls,” and this\r\nlatter term will consequently be used wherever any ambiguity is likely\r\nto arise from the use of the simple term Chaitya.\r\n\r\n[49] These inscriptions have been published in various forms and\r\nat various times by the Asiatic Societies of Calcutta and London\r\n(‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 566, _et\r\nseqq._; ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. xii. p. 153, _et\r\nseqq._) and in various other publications, but always mixed up with\r\nextraneous matters. It is, however, very much to be regretted that\r\na carefully-edited translation is not issued in some separate form\r\neasily accessible to the general public. An absolutely authentic and\r\nunaltered body of Buddhist doctrine, as it stood 250 years before\r\nthe birth of Christ, would be one of the most valuable contributions\r\npossible to the religious history of the modern world, and so much has\r\nbeen already done that the task does not seem difficult. Among other\r\nthings, they explain to us negatively why we have so little history\r\nin India in these days. Asoka is only busied about doctrines. He does\r\nnot even mention his father’s name; and makes no allusion to any\r\nhistorical event, not even those connected with the life of the founder\r\nof the religion. Among a people so careless of genealogy, history is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[50] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 794.\r\n\r\n[51] Ibid., plate 40.\r\n\r\n[52] Ibid., p. 969, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[53] These dimensions are taken from Capt. Burt’s drawings published in\r\nthe ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. iii. plate 3.\r\n\r\n[54] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plates 9, 10, 10a, _et passim_.\r\n\r\n[55] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 274, plate 46.\r\n\r\n[56] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plates 1 and 5, and plates 89 and 90.\r\n\r\n[57] Ibid., plate 42.\r\n\r\n[58] In the description accompanying Daniell’s view of this cave he\r\nsays: “On the pillars to the right, above the capital, is a group of\r\nlions, from the centre of which a few years since arose the chacra, or\r\nwar disk of Vichnou, though not the least appearance of it at present\r\nremains.” On the left he remarked a figure of Buddha, which he mistook\r\nfor Mahadeva, and in another part a row of bulls, and he adds: “The\r\nChacra of Vichnou, the Mahadeva, and the bulls, seem not to favour the\r\nopinion of its being a temple of the Bhoods.” He was not aware how\r\ninextricably these religions were mixed up at the time when this cave\r\nwas excavated, about A.D. 400.\r\n\r\n[59] Turnour in ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vii.,\r\np. 1013.\r\n\r\nThe fame of this distribution seems to have reached Europe at least as\r\nearly as the 1st century of the Christian Era, inasmuch as Plutarch\r\n(‘Moralia,’ p. 1002, Dübner edition, Paris, 1841) describes a similar\r\npartition of the remains of Menander, among eight cities who are said\r\nto have desired to possess his remains; but as he does not hint that it\r\nwas for purposes of worship, the significance of the fact does not seem\r\nto have been appreciated.\r\n\r\n[60] ‘Mahawanso,’ p. 26, ‘Hiouen Thsang,’ vol. ii. p. 417.\r\n\r\n[61] Account of the great bell at Rangoon, Hough, ‘Asiatic Researches,’\r\nvol. xiv. p. 270.\r\n\r\n[62] Abstracted from Turnour’s ‘Mahawanso,’ p. 4.\r\n\r\n[63] There may be an error in this date to the extent of its being from\r\nfifteen to twenty years too early.\r\n\r\n[64] The principal particulars of this story are contained in a\r\nCingalese work called the ‘Daladavamsa,’ recently translated by Sir\r\nMutu Comara Swamy. I have collected the further evidence on this\r\nsubject in a paper I read to the Asiatic Society, and published in\r\ntheir ‘Journal’ (N.S.), vol. iii p. 132, _et. seqq._, and again in\r\n‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p. 174, _et. seqq._\r\n\r\n[65] The date being given as 245, Samvat has generally been assumed to\r\nbe dated from the era of Vicramaditya. I am not aware, however, of any\r\ninscription of so early an age being dated from that era, nor of any\r\nBuddhist inscription in which it is used either then or thereafter.\r\n\r\n[66] The same fate had overtaken another tooth relic at Nagrak in\r\nnorthern India. Fa Hian, B.C. 400, describes it as perfect in his 13th\r\nchapter. ‘Hiouen Thsang,’ vol. ii. p. 97, describes the stupa as ruined,\r\nand the tooth having disappeared.\r\n\r\n[67] For a translation, &c., see ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society,’ vol. v. p. 33. See also Bird, ‘Historical\r\nResearches,’ Bombay, 1847.\r\n\r\n[68] ‘Foé Koué Ki,’ ch. xii. p. 77.\r\n\r\n[69] ‘Hiouen Thsang,’ vol. i. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[70] ‘Foé Koué Ki,’ p. 353. A detailed account of its transference from\r\nthe true Gandhara--Peshawur--to the new Gandhara in Kandahar will be\r\nfound in a paper by Sir Henry Rawlinson, ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ vol. xi. p. 127.\r\n\r\n[71] Among the bas-reliefs of the Bharhut tope is one representing just\r\nsuch a domical roof as this (Woodcut No. 90). It is not, however, quite\r\neasy to make out its plan, nor to feel sure whether the object on the\r\naltar is a relic, or whether it may not be some other kind of offering.\r\n\r\n[72] ‘Bhilsa Topes, or Buddhist Monuments in Central India,’ Smith,\r\nElder, and Co., 1854. One half of my work on ‘Tree and Serpent\r\nWorship,’ and forty-five of its plates, besides woodcuts, are devoted\r\nto the illustration of the great Tope; and numerous papers have\r\nappeared on the same subject in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society’\r\nand elsewhere. A cast of the eastern gateway is in the South Kensington\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[73] ‘Mahawanso,’ p. 76. See also ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p. 99,\r\n_et seqq._, where all this is more fully set out than is necessary here.\r\n\r\n[74] Cunningham, ‘Bhilsa Topes,’ p. 299, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[75] The Chandragupta inscription on the rail near the eastern\r\ngateway (‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. ii. p.\r\n454) is evidently a subsequent addition, and belongs to the year\r\nA.D. 400.\r\n\r\n[76] These views, plans, &c., are taken from a Memoir by Capt. J. D.\r\nCunningham, ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ August, 1847.\r\n\r\n[77] As all the particulars regarding all these topes, except the great\r\none and No. 3 of Sanchi, are taken from Gen. Cunningham’s work entitled\r\n‘Bhilsa Topes,’ published by Smith and Elder, in one volume 8vo., in\r\n1854, it has not been thought necessary to repeat the reference at\r\nevery statement.\r\n\r\n[78] These dimensions and details are taken from Gen.

A tope cannot be earlier than\r\nthe coins deposited in it, but, as in this case, it may be one or two\r\nhundred years more modern.\r\n\r\n[101] ‘Ariana Antiqua,’ p. 109.\r\n\r\n[102] Thomas in ‘Prinsep,’ vol. i. p. 144.\r\n\r\n[103] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. iii. p. 559.\r\n\r\n[104] Thomas in ‘Prinsep,’ p. 148.\r\n\r\n[105] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 167, plate 65.\r\n\r\n[106] Thomas’s ‘Prinsep,’ vol. i. p. 94.\r\n\r\n[107] In the text it is certainly printed “three” with a reference to\r\n19 in the plate 21 of vol. iii.

I observe that\r\nGeneral Cunningham, in his volume just received, adopts the same views.\r\nAt p. 78, vol. v., he says: “I have a strong suspicion that General\r\nVentura’s record of three Sassanian coins having been found below\r\ndeposit B may be erroneous.”\r\n\r\n[108] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. iii. plate 21,\r\nfig. 18.\r\n\r\n[109] ‘Foé Koué Ki,’ chap. xiii.\r\n\r\n[110] ‘Fa Hian,’ Beal’s translation, p. 32. ‘Hiouen Thsang,’ vol. i. p.\r\n89.\r\n\r\n[111] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 172.\r\n\r\n[112] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ Preface to the First Edition.\r\n\r\n[113] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 10.\r\n\r\n[114] ‘Memorandum,’ dated 13th April, 1874, printed by the Bengal\r\nGovernment, but not published.\r\n\r\n[115] ‘Voyages dans les Contrées Occidentales,’ vol. i. p. 465.\r\n\r\n[116] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. plates 8 to 11.\r\n\r\n[117] For this last determination, see ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p.\r\n99, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[118] It is to be hoped that when Gen. Cunningham publishes the volume\r\nhe is preparing on the Bharhut Tope, he will add photographs of the\r\npillars of this rail. It would add immensely to the value of his work\r\nif it afforded the means of comparing the two. Some illustrations of\r\nthe sculpture from Major Kittoe’s drawings will be found in ‘Tree and\r\nSerpent Worship,’ woodcuts 7, 20, 24. Two of them are reproduced here,\r\nthe first representing a man on his knees before an altar worshipping\r\na tree, while a flying figure brings a garland to adorn it. The other\r\nrepresents a relic casket, over which a seven-headed Naga spreads\r\nhis hood, and over him an umbrella of state. There are, besides, two\r\ntrees in a sacred enclosure, and another casket with three umbrellas\r\n(Woodcuts Nos. 25, 26). They are from drawings by Major Kittoe.\r\n\r\n[119] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p. 99, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[120] When I wrote my work on ‘Tree and Serpent Worship’ nothing was\r\npractically known as to the age of the jatakas, or the early form in\r\nwhich they were represented; much, therefore, that was then advanced\r\nwas, or at least appeared to others to be, mere guess work, or daring\r\nspeculation. It is, consequently, no small satisfaction to me to find\r\nthat this subsequent discovery of a monument 200 years earlier does\r\nnot force me to unsay a single word I then said. On the contrary,\r\neverything I then advanced is confirmed, and these inscriptions render\r\ncertain what before their discovery was necessarily sometimes deficient\r\nin proof.\r\n\r\n[121] The following outline (Woodcut No. 28, on the next page) of\r\none of the bas-reliefs on a pillar at Bharhut may serve to convey an\r\nidea of the style of art and of the quaint way in which the stories\r\nare there told. On the left, a king with a five-headed snake-hood is\r\nrepresented, kneeling before an altar strewn with flowers, behind\r\nwhich is a tree (_Sirisa Accasia_?) hung with garlands. Behind him is\r\nan inscription to this effect, “Erapatra the Naga Raja worships the\r\nDivinity (Bhagavat).” Above him is the great five-headed Naga himself,\r\nrising from a lake. To its right a man in the robes of a priest\r\nstanding up to his middle in the water, and above the Naga a female\r\ngenius, apparently floating in the air. Below is another Naga Raja,\r\nwith his quintuple snake-hood, and behind him two females with a single\r\nsnake at the back of their heads--an arrangement which is universal\r\nin all Naga sculpture. They are standing up to their waists in water.\r\nIf we may depend on the inscription below him, this is Erapatra twice\r\nover, and the females his two wives. I should, however, rather be\r\ninclined to fancy there were two Naga Rajas represented with their two\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nThis bas-relief is further interesting as being an epitome of my work\r\non ‘Tree and Serpent Worship.’ As expressing in the shortest possible\r\ncompass nearly all that is said there at length, it will also serve\r\nto explain much that is advanced in the following pages. As it is 200\r\nyears older than anything that was known when that book was written, it\r\nis a confirmation of its theories, as satisfactory as it is complete.\r\n\r\n[122] ‘Mahawanso,’ Introduction, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[123] Outlines of these sculptures are given in General Cunningham’s\r\nthird volume of his ‘Reports,’ plate 6. I have photographs of the\r\nwhole, which represent what is omitted in the lithographs.\r\n\r\n[124] General Cunningham collected and translated 196 inscriptions from\r\nthis tope, which will be found in his work on the Bhilsa Topes, p. 235,\r\n_et seqq._, plates 16-19.\r\n\r\n[125] The details from which these determinations are arrived at\r\nwill be found in ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p. 98, _et seqq._ It is\r\nconsequently not necessary to repeat them here.\r\n\r\n[126] It is very much to be regretted that when Lieut. Cole had the\r\nopportunity he did not take a cast of this one instead of the eastern.\r\nIt is far more complete, and its sculptures more interesting.\r\n\r\n[127] For details of these sculptures and references, I must refer the\r\nreader to my work on ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ where they are all\r\nrepresented and described in great detail. Sculptures do not, strictly\r\nspeaking, belong to this work, and, except for historical purposes, are\r\nnot generally alluded to.\r\n\r\n[128] They must certainly have been very common in India, for, though\r\nonly one representation of them has been detected among the sculptures\r\nat Sanchi (‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plate 27, fig. 2), at least ten\r\nrepresentations of them are found at Amravati, plates 59 (fig. 2), 60\r\n(fig. 1), 63 (fig. 3), 64 (fig. 1), 69, 83 (fig. 2), 85 (figs. 1 and\r\n2), 96 (fig. 3), 98 (fig. 2), and no doubt many more may yet be found.\r\n\r\n[129] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ Appendix I. p. 270.\r\n\r\n[130] In Burmah at the present day a roll precisely similar to this,\r\nformed of coloured muslin, distended by light bamboo hoops, is borne\r\non men’s shoulders in the same manner as shown here, on each side of\r\nthe procession that accompanies a high priest or other ecclesiastical\r\ndignitary to the grave.\r\n\r\n[131] For the reasons of the following determination and other\r\nparticulars, the reader is referred to my work on ‘Tree and Serpent\r\nWorship,’ where the whole are set out at length. A short account of the\r\ntope will also be found in the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’\r\nvol. iii. (N. S.) p. 132, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[132] ‘Histoire de Hiouen Thsang,’ traduite par Julien, vol. i. p. 188.\r\n\r\n[133] It is probable that a tolerably correct idea of the general\r\nexterior appearance of the buildings from which these caves were copied\r\nmay be obtained from the _Raths_ (as they are called) of Mahavellipore\r\n(described further on, p. 328). These are monuments of a later\r\ndate, and belonging to a different religion, but they correspond so\r\nnearly in all their parts with the temples and monasteries now under\r\nconsideration, that we cannot doubt their being, in most respects,\r\nclose copies of them. Curiously enough, the best illustrations of some\r\nof them are to be found among the unpublished sculptures of the Bharhut\r\nTope.\r\n\r\n[134] The only buildings in India I know of that gave the least hint of\r\nthe external forms or construction of these halls are the huts of the\r\nTodas on the Nilgiri Hills. In a work recently published by the late\r\nMr. Breeks, of the Madras Civil Service, he gives two photographs of\r\nthese dwellings, plates 8 and 9. Their roofs have precisely the same\r\nelliptical forms as the chaitya with the ridge, giving the ogee form\r\nexternally, and altogether, whether by accident or design, they are\r\nminiature chaitya halls. Externally they are covered with short thatch,\r\nneatly laid on. Such forms may have existed in India two thousand years\r\nago, and may have given rise to the peculiarities of the chaitya halls,\r\nbut it is, of course, impossible to prove it.\r\n\r\n[135] ‘Illustrations of the Rock-cut Temples of India,’ 1 vol., text\r\n8vo., with folio plates. Weale, London, 1845.\r\n\r\n[136] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii.\r\npt. ii. p. 36, _et seqq._, and vol. iv. p. 340, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[137] Cunningham, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 45.\r\n\r\n[138] At Kondooty, near Bombay, there is a chaitya cave of much more\r\nmodern date, which possesses a circular chamber like this. In the older\r\nexamples it is probable a relic or some sacred symbol occupied the\r\ncell; in the later it may have been an image of Buddha. No plans or\r\ndetails of the Kondooty temple have, so far as I know, been published.\r\nI speak from information derived from MS. drawings.\r\n\r\n[139] General Cunningham (‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 45) and\r\nothers are in the habit of calling this an Egyptian form. This it\r\ncertainly is not, as no Egyptian doorway had sloping jambs. Nor can it\r\nproperly be called Pelasgic. The Pelasgi did use that form, but derived\r\nit from stone constructions. The Indians only obtained it from wood.\r\n\r\n[140] A very detailed account of all these caves will be found in Gen.\r\nCunningham’s ‘Archæological Report’ for 1861-62.\r\n\r\n[141] From a photograph and an unpublished paper by Professor\r\nBhandarkur, read before the Oriental Congress.\r\n\r\n[142] From Bhandarkur’s paper, _ubi supra_.\r\n\r\n[143] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. v. p.\r\n55.\r\n\r\n[144] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. v. pp.\r\n152-3.\r\n\r\n[145] A few years ago it was reported that this screen was in danger\r\nof falling outwards, and I wrote repeatedly to India begging that\r\nsomething might be done to preserve it; but I have never been able\r\nto learn if this has been attended to. Only a small portion of the\r\noriginal ribbing of the Bhaja cave now remains. That of the Bedsa cave\r\nhas been destroyed within the last ten or twelve years (‘Journal Bombay\r\nBranch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. ix. p. 223); and it would be\r\na thousand pities if this, which is the only original screen in India,\r\nwere allowed to perish when a very small outlay would save it. Like the\r\nIron pillar at Delhi which never rusts, teak wood that does not decay\r\nthough exposed to the atmosphere for 2000 years, is a phenomenon worth\r\nthe attention not only of antiquaries, but of natural philosophers.\r\n\r\n[146] For further particulars regarding the Ajunta caves, the reader\r\nis referred to a paper I wrote in the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ 1842, and republished afterwards with a folio volume of\r\nplates to illustrate it.\r\n\r\n[147] These inscriptions are translated in Bhau Dajis’ paper on the\r\nAjunta inscriptions, ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ vol. viii. p. 63, as if found in cave 2. On the accompanying\r\nplate they are described as one on cave 10, the other on cave 12.\r\n\r\n[148] Kittoe in ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ March,\r\n1847, plate 6.\r\n\r\n[149] Sir Charles Mallet, in the second volume of the ‘Bombay Literary\r\nTransactions,’ quotes a tradition that the Ellora caves were excavated\r\nby a Raja Eelu, 1000 years before his day. This might be true if\r\napplied to the Brahmanical Kailas, but hardly to any Buddhist cave in\r\nthe series.\r\n\r\n[150] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. v. p.\r\n14.\r\n\r\n[151] Loc. cit. p. 25.\r\n\r\n[152] Introduction to ‘Mahawanso,’ p. 30.\r\n\r\n[153] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[154] A tolerably correct representation of these sculptures is\r\nengraved in Langle’s ‘Hindostan,’ vol. ii. p. 81, after Niebuhr. The\r\ncurious part of the thing is, that the Buddhist figures of the Karli\r\nfaçade are not copied here also, from which I would infer, as well as\r\nfrom their own intrinsic evidence, that they were more modern than even\r\nthis cave.\r\n\r\n[155] For further particulars regarding this cave, the reader is\r\nreferred to my work on the ‘Rock-cut Temples of India,’ p. 36, plates\r\n11 and 12.\r\n\r\n[156] The plates in Gen. Cunningham’s ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii.\r\npl. 70 and 74, are on too small a scale to be of much use. I have not\r\nmyself visited these caves.\r\n\r\n[157] The particulars of the architecture of these caves are taken from\r\nGen. Cunningham’s report above alluded to. I entirely agree with him as\r\nto their age, and am surprised Dr. Impey could be so mistaken regarding\r\nthem. ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. v. p.\r\n336, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[158] Throughout this work the term “Vihara” is applied only to\r\nmonasteries, the abodes of monks or hermits. It was not, however, used\r\nin that restricted sense only, in former times, though it has been so\r\nby all modern writers. Hiouen Thsang, for instance, calls the Great\r\nTower at Buddh Gaya a vihara, and describes similar towers at Nalanda,\r\n200 and 300 feet high, as viharas. The ‘Mahawanso’ also applies the\r\nterm indiscriminately to temples of a certain class, and to residences.\r\nMy impression is that all buildings designed in storeys were called\r\nviharas, whether used for the abode of priests or to enshrine relics or\r\nimages. The name was used to distinguish them from stupas or towers,\r\nwhich were always relic shrines, or erected as memorials of places or\r\nevents, and never were residences or simulated to be such, or contained\r\nimages, till the last gasp of the style, as at Kholvi. At present this\r\nis only a theory; it may, before long, become a certainty. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the residences ought probably to be called Sangharamas,\r\nbut, to avoid multiplication of terms, vihara is used in this work as\r\nthe synonym of monastery, which is the sense in which it is usually\r\nunderstood by modern authors.\r\n\r\n[159] Vol. iv., Woodcuts Nos. 89, 90.\r\n\r\n[160] Beal’s ‘Fa Hian,’ p. 139, ‘Hiouen Thsang,’ vol. iii. p. 102.\r\n\r\n[161] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. vi.

Kittoe.\r\n\r\n[170] This inscription first attracted the attention of Stirling, and\r\na plate representing it very imperfectly is given in the 15th volume\r\nof the ‘Asiatic Researches.’ It was afterwards copied by Kittoe, and a\r\ntranslation, as far as its imperfection admitted, made by Prinsep, with\r\nthe assistance of his pundits, and published. ‘Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 1080, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[171] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 1073,\r\nplate 54.\r\n\r\n[172] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 1075.\r\n\r\n[173] There is a very faithful drawing of this bas-relief by Kittoe in\r\nthe ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vii. plate 44.\r\nBut casts of all these sculptures were taken some three years ago by\r\nMr. Locke, of the School of Design, Calcutta, and photographs of these\r\ncasts, with others of the caves, are now before me. Reduced copies of\r\nsome of these were published on plate 100, ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’\r\n2nd edition, 1873.\r\n\r\n[174] That there were Yavanas in Orissa about this time is abundantly\r\nevident, from the native authorities quoted by Stirling--‘Asiatic\r\nResearches,’ vol. xv. p. 258, _et seqq._ These represent them as\r\ncoming from Kashmir, and Babul Des, or Persia, and one account\r\nnames the invader as Hangsha Deo, which looks very like Hushka, or\r\nHuvishka (the brother of Kanishka), whose inscriptions are found at\r\nMuttra.--Cunningham, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 32, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[175] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vii. plate 42.\r\n‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plate 100.\r\n\r\n[176] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plate 100, p. 105.\r\n\r\n[177] There may have been a structural dagoba attached to the series,\r\nwhich may have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[178] Wilson, ‘Ariana Antiqua,’ plate 10.\r\n\r\n[179] These inscriptions were first published by Lieut. Brett, with\r\ntranslations by Dr. Stevenson, in the fifth volume of the ‘Journal\r\nBombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ p. 39, _et seqq._, plates\r\n1 to 16. They were afterwards revised by Messrs. E. W. and A. A. West\r\nin the eighth volume of the same journal, p. 37, _et seqq._, and\r\ntranslated by Professor Bhandarkar in a paper not yet published, but to\r\nwhich I have had access. I have also been assisted by manuscript plans\r\nand notes by Mr. Burgess; and, though I have not seen the caves myself,\r\nI fancy that I can realise all their main features without difficulty.\r\n\r\n[180] Professor Bhandarkar, in his paper on these inscriptions, passes\r\nover the inscriptions in the interior of the chaitya, without alluding\r\nto them in any way. Is it that there is any mistake about them? and\r\nthat the cave is a century more modern than they would lead us to\r\nsuppose? The answer is probably to be obtained on the spot, and there\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n[181] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. viii.\r\np. 40.\r\n\r\n[182] _Ante_, p. 129.

See also, ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. v. p.\r\n726.\r\n\r\n[192] Curiously enough, on the roof of this cave there are four square\r\ncompartments representing the same scene, in different manners--a\r\nking, or very important personage, drinking out of a cup with male and\r\nfemale attendants. What the story is, is not known, but the persons\r\nrepresented are not Indians, but Persians, and the costumes those of\r\nthe Sassanian period. Copies of these pictures by Mr. Griffith are now\r\nexhibited in the India Museum at Kensington.\r\n\r\n[193] ‘Rock cut Temples,’ pl. 8.\r\n\r\n[194] Eight large lithographic plates illustrating these caves will\r\nbe found in my work on the ‘Rock-cut Temples of India,’ 1843. In\r\n1864 I published a small volume containing fifty-eight photographic\r\nillustrations of the same series. Reductions of some of the more\r\nimportant frescoes, copied by Major Gill, were fortunately published\r\nby Mrs. Speir in her ‘Life in Ancient India,’ in 1856; and since then\r\nMr. Griffith, of the School of Arts at Bombay, has been employed to\r\nrecover, as far as it can now be done, the frescoes destroyed in the\r\nCrystal Palace fire. If he is successful, these curious paintings\r\nmay still be made available for the history of art in India. It is\r\nfeared, however, that the means taken by Major Gill to heighten their\r\ncolour before copying them, and the destructive tendencies of British\r\ntourists, have rendered the task to a great extent a hopeless one.\r\n\r\n[195] _Ante_, p. 59.\r\n\r\n[196] I possess a large collection of MS. drawings of these caves, made\r\nfor Daniell by his assistants in 1795-6.\r\n\r\n[197] ‘Voyage en Arabie et d’autres pays circonvoisins,’ 1776-80.

Those of Dhumnar I have seen\r\nmyself, but till those of Kholvi are photographed we shall not be able\r\nto speak positively regarding them; the General’s drawings are on too\r\nsmall a scale for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[200] The Kholvi group is situated more than sixty miles north of\r\nUjjain, that of Dhumnar about twenty-five further north, and deeper\r\ninto the Central Indian jungles.\r\n\r\n[201] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv. pp. 287-291.\r\n\r\n[202] There is a representation of this cave in Dr. Bird’s book, plate\r\n16, but so badly done that it requires being told what is intended in\r\norder to find it out.\r\n\r\n[203] I have for some time possessed photographs of about one hundred\r\nobjects obtained in these excavations, principally those in the Lahore\r\nMuseum; and latterly I have received from Gen. Cunningham twenty\r\nlarge photographic plates, representing 165 separate objects recently\r\nobtained in a more methodical manner by himself, principally from\r\nJamalgiri. These plates are, as I understand, to form part of the\r\nillustrations of a work he intends publishing on the subject. When it\r\nis in the hands of the public there will be some data to reason upon.\r\nAt present there is scarcely anything to which a reference can be made.\r\n\r\n[204] When Gen. Cunningham was selecting specimens in the Lahore\r\nMuseum, to be photographed for the Vienna Exhibition, he complains\r\nthat he could only ascertain the “find spot” of five or six out of the\r\nwhole number--500 or 600. It is therefore to be regretted that, when\r\npublishing a list with descriptions of the 165 objects discovered by\r\nhimself (‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. v. pp. 197-202), he does not\r\nmention where they came from, and gives the dimensions of a few only.\r\n\r\n[205] The mode in which the excavations have recently been conducted by\r\nGovernment has been to send out a party of sappers in the cold weather\r\nto dig, but the officer in charge of the party has been the subaltern\r\nwho happened to be in command of the company at the time. A new\r\nofficer is consequently appointed every year, and no one has ever been\r\nselected because he had any experience in such matters or any taste\r\nfor such pursuits. What has been done has been done wonderfully well,\r\nconsidering the circumstances under which it was undertaken; but the\r\nresult on the whole is, as might be expected, painfully disappointing.\r\nQuite recently, however, it is understood that Gen. Cunningham has\r\ntaken charge of the excavations, and we may consequently hope that in\r\nfuture these defects of arrangement will be remedied.\r\n\r\n[206] In the fifth volume of his ‘Archæological Reports’ just\r\nreceived, Gen. Cunningham assumes that both these were stupas of the\r\nordinary character. They may have been so, but both having steps up\r\nto them would seem to militate against that assumption. The circular\r\none is only 22 ft., the square one 15 ft. in diameter, and there is\r\nconsequently no room on either for a procession-path round the dome, if\r\nit existed; and, if this is so, of what use could the steps be? Lieut.\r\nCrompton, who excavated the Jamalgiri monastery, is clearly of opinion\r\nthat it was a platform--see page 2 of his report, published in the\r\n‘Lahore Gazette,’ 30th August, 1873. To prevent misunderstanding, I may\r\nmention that Gen. Cunningham, in his plate No. 14, by mistake, ascribes\r\nthe plan to Sergt. Wilcher, instead of to Lieut. Crompton.\r\n\r\n[207] ‘Embassy to Thibet,’ p. 317.\r\n\r\n[208] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. vii.,\r\nNo. 21, p. 116, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[209] These have been removed, and are now in Gen. Cunningham’s\r\npossession at Simla, I believe. He has sent me photographs of twelve of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[210] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plates 24 (fig. 3) and 36 (fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[211] The modillion cornice, though placed on the capital in the\r\nphotograph, belongs in reality to another part of the building.\r\n\r\n[212] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. v. pp. 49 and 196.\r\n\r\n[213] ‘The Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored.’ By the Author.\r\nPart II. sect. i., _et passim_.\r\n\r\n[214] One curious peculiarity of these Gandhara sculptures is that they\r\ngenerally retain the sloping jamb on each side of their openings. In\r\nIndia and in a structural building this peculiarity would certainly\r\nfix their age as anterior to the Christian Era. In Gandhara it is\r\nonly found in decorative sculpture, and retained apparently from\r\nassociation. It does not, at all events, appear as if any argument\r\ncould be based on its use as there employed.\r\n\r\n[215] Assuming that his age has been correctly ascertained, which I am\r\nbeginning, however, to doubt exceedingly.\r\n\r\n[216] I possess photographs of about 300 objects from the Lahore and\r\nother museums, and have had access to about as many actual examples--of\r\nan inferior class, however--in collections in this country, but even\r\nthey barely suffice for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[217] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. v., Introduction, p. vi. See also\r\nAppendix to the same volume, pp. 193-4.\r\n\r\n[218] Texier and Pullan, ‘Byzantine Architecture,’ London, 1864, pls.\r\n22-25 and pl. 44.\r\n\r\n[219] De Voguë, ‘Syrie Centrale,’ _passim_.\r\n\r\n[220] By a curious slip of the pen General Cunningham (‘Archæological\r\nReports,’ vol. v. p. 193) places “These Roman examples in the baths of\r\nCaracalla in the beginning of the first century of the Christian Era,\r\nalmost contemporary,” he adds, “with that which I assign to the finest\r\nIndo-Corinthian examples just described, namely, the latter half\r\nof the first century B.C.” This is so evidently a mere slip\r\nthat I would not allude to it were it not that much of his argument for\r\nthe early age of these sculptures is based upon this coincidence.\r\n\r\n[221] There is a capital at Siah, in Syria, on which a bust is\r\nintroduced, which may be as early as the Christian Era, but it is a\r\nsolitary example not repeated afterwards, so far as I know. See ‘Syrie\r\nCentrale,’ by De Voguë, plate 3.\r\n\r\n[222] In Beal’s introduction to ‘Fa Hian,’ p. 18, he mentions, on\r\nChinese authority, which is much more reliable than Indian, that a\r\nstatue of Buddha was brought to China from Kartchou (?) in B.C. 121. On\r\nasking Mr. Beal to look carefully into the authorities for this\r\nstatement, he reports them to be hazy in the extreme, and not to be\r\nrelied upon.\r\n\r\n[223] I believe it is generally admitted that the _rédaction_ of the\r\n‘Mahawanso,’ and other Ceylonese scriptures made in Buddhaghosha’s time,\r\nA.D. 408-420, is the oldest authentic Buddhist work we now possess.\r\nThey, like the ‘Lalita Vistara,’ and other works, are founded on older\r\nworks of course, but the earlier forms have been lost, and what we have\r\nis what the writers of the 5th and subsequent centuries thought they\r\nought to be.\r\n\r\n[224] Unfortunately no Indian list of these patriarchs has yet come\r\nto light. Those we have are derived from Japanese or Chinese sources,\r\nand are all tainted with the falsification which the Chinese made\r\nin Buddhist chronology by putting Buddha’s date back to\r\nabout 1000 B.C., in order that he might have precedence of\r\nConfucius in antiquity! for so it is that history is written in the\r\nEast. For a list of the twenty-eight known patriarchs, see Lassen,\r\n‘Indische Alterthumskunde,’ vol. ii., Beilage ii. p. 1004.\r\n\r\n[225] The capitals of these pillars are so ruined that it is difficult\r\nto speak very confidently about them. I have drawings of them by Col.\r\nYule and by Mr. W. Simpson, and latterly Gen. Cunningham has published\r\ndrawings of them, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. v. pl. 24. None of them\r\nare quite satisfactory, but this must arise from the difficulty of the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n[226] No complete history of the ivories has been published which is\r\nsufficient for reference on this subject. Gori’s are too badly engraved\r\nfor this purpose; but the first twelve plates in Labarte’s ‘Histoire de\r\nl’Art’ are perfect as far as they go. So are the plates in Maskell’s\r\n‘Catalogue of the South Kensington Museum,’ and those published by\r\nthe Arundel Society; but it is to the collection of casts in these\r\ntwo last-named institutions that the reader should refer for fuller\r\ninformation on the subject.\r\n\r\n[227] I purchased from his artist, Mr. Nicholl, and possess all the\r\noriginal sketches from which the illustrations of his book were\r\nengraved.\r\n\r\n[228] When the present governor was appointed hopes ran high that this\r\nunsatisfactory state of our knowledge would be cleared away. The stars,\r\nhowever, in their courses have warred against archæology in Ceylon\r\never since he assumed sway over the island, and the only residuum of\r\nhis exertions seems to be that a thoroughly competent German scholar,\r\nHerr Goldsmidt, is occupied now in copying the inscriptions, which\r\nare numerous, in the island. These, however, are just what is least\r\nwanted at present. In India, where we have no history and no dates,\r\ninscriptions are invaluable, and are, in fact, our only sources of\r\ncorrect information. In Ceylon, however, they are, for archæological\r\npurposes, comparatively unimportant. What is there wanted are plans and\r\narchitectural details, and these, accompanied by general descriptions\r\nand dimensions, would, with the photographs we possess, supply all we\r\nnow want. Any qualified person accustomed to such work could supply\r\nnearly all that is wanted in twelve months, for the two principal\r\ncities at least; but I despair of seeing it done in my day.\r\n\r\n[229] Beal’s translation, p. 157.\r\n\r\n[230] The artist who made the drawings for Sir E. Tennent’s book, not\r\nknowing what a serpent-hood was, has in almost all instances so drawn\r\nit as to be unrecognisable. The photographs, however, make it quite\r\nclear that all had serpent-hoods.\r\n\r\n[231] The cubit of Ceylon is nearly 2 ft. 3 in.\r\n\r\n[232] In the photographs it is called an altar, which it certainly was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n[233] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ pl. 19. In some respects it resembles\r\nthe Woodcuts Nos. 34 and 35.\r\n\r\n[234] Since the drawing was made from which this cut is taken, it has\r\nbeen thoroughly repaired and made as unlike what it was as can well be\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\n[235] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal’ for March, 1847, p.\r\n218.\r\n\r\n[236] ‘Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii. p. 474,\r\nand ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. xiii. p. 168.\r\n\r\n[237] I am afraid this is no longer true. From what I learn, I fear it\r\nhas been repaired.\r\n\r\n[238] ‘Mahawanso,’ Turnour’s translation, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[239] Loc. cit., p. 235.\r\n\r\n[240] At Amravati the Zoophorus (Woodcut No. 36) consisted of the same\r\nanimals, I believe, but it is not complete, no fragment of the horse\r\nhaving been brought home, and generally, it seems that this limited\r\nmenagerie is to be found in all Buddhist works.\r\n\r\n[241] Any architect of ordinary ability could in a week easily make the\r\nplans and drawings requisite to give us all the information required\r\nrespecting these halls in Anuradhapura. I am not sure that Capt.\r\nHogg has not already done all that is wanted, but he was sent off so\r\nsuddenly to St. Helena that no time was allowed him to communicate his\r\ninformation to others, even if he had it.\r\n\r\n[242] Singularly enough, the natives of Behar ascribe the planting of\r\ntheir Bo-tree to Duttagaimuni, the pious king of Ceylon.--See Buchanan\r\nHamilton’s ‘Statistics of Behar,’ p. 76, Montgomery Martin’s edition.\r\n\r\n[243] According to Mr. Rhys Davids, the proper name of the city is\r\nPulastipura (‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. vii. (N.S.)\r\np. 156), and its modern name Topawœwa or Topawa. As, however, that here\r\ngiven is the only one by which it is known in English literature, it is\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n[244] ‘Christianity in Ceylon,’ Murray, 1850; ‘An Account of the Island\r\nof Ceylon,’ 2 vols., Longmans, 1859. Since then Mr. Lawton’s and Capt.\r\nHogg’s photographs have added considerably to the precision but not\r\nto the extent of our knowledge. Not one plan or dimension, and no\r\ndescription, so far as I know, have reached this country.\r\n\r\n[245] Among Capt. Hogg’s photographs are two colossal statues of\r\nBuddha, one at Seperawa, described as 41 ft. high, the other at a place\r\ncalled Aukana, 40 ft. high; but where these places are there is nothing\r\nto show. They are extremely similar to one another, and, except in\r\ndimensions, to that at the Gal Vihara.\r\n\r\n[246] They occur also on Asoka’s pillars in the earliest known\r\nsculptures in India (Woodcut No. 6). It was the cackling of these\r\nsacred geese which is said to have saved the Capitol at Rome from being\r\nsurprised by the Gauls.\r\n\r\n[247] The preceding woodcut, from Sir E. Tennent’s book, is far from\r\ndoing justice to the building or to Mr. Nicholl’s drawings, which\r\nare before me; but among the half dozen photographs I possess of it\r\nnot one is sufficiently explanatory to convey a correct idea of its\r\npeculiarities, and, after all, without plans or dimensions, it is in\r\nvain to attempt to convey a correct idea of it to others.\r\n\r\n[248] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. iii. p. 31, _et seqq._, plates 13\r\nand 15. As neither photographs nor even drawings of these figures are\r\nyet available, we are still unable to speak of their style of art, or\r\nto feel sure of their authenticity; nor has the era from which these\r\ndates are to be calculated been fixed with anything like certainty. The\r\nevidence, however, as it now stands, is strongly in favour of their\r\nbeing what they are represented to be.\r\n\r\n[249] Vol. i. p. 359, Woodcut No. 241.\r\n\r\n[250] The antiquities of Java will probably, to some extent at least,\r\nsupply this deficiency, as will be pointed out in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n[251] Vol. i. p. 212, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[252] Vol. i. p. 213.\r\n\r\n[253] Ibid., p. 334.\r\n\r\n[254] Fully illustrated in vol. ii. of the Dilettanti Society’s\r\n‘Antiquities of Ionia.’\r\n\r\n[255] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv. p. 1, _et\r\nseqq._; ‘Madras Journal,’ vol. xx. p. 78, _et seqq._; ‘Journal Bombay\r\nBranch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii. p. 206, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[256] ‘Archæological Reports,’ 1874, pp. 41 and 42.\r\n\r\n[257] Loc. cit., plate 54.\r\n\r\n[258] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. ix. p. 270, vol. xvii. p. 285.\r\n\r\n[259] ‘Hiouen Thsang, Vie et Voyages,’ vol. i. p. 253, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[260] See Woodcuts Nos. 99, 112, 122, 124, 127, 172, 177 and 178 of\r\nvol. i. of this work.\r\n\r\n[261] In his work on the ‘Antiquities of Orissa,’ Babu Rajendra Lalâ\r\nMittra suggests at page 31 something of this sort, but if his diagram\r\nwere all that is to be said in favour of the hypothesis, I would feel\r\ninclined to reject it.\r\n\r\n[262] No really satisfactory translation of these Asoka edicts has yet\r\nbeen published. The best is that of Professor Wilson, in vol. xii.\r\n‘Journal of Royal Asiatic Society.’ Mr. Burgess has, however, recently\r\nre-copied that at Girnar, and General Cunningham those in the north of\r\nIndia. When these are published it may be possible to make a better\r\ntranslation than has yet appeared.\r\n\r\n[263] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. viii.\r\np. 120.\r\n\r\n[264] Ibid., vol. vii. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[265] Lieut. Postans’ ‘Journey to Girnar,’ ‘Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal,’ vol. vii. p. 865, _et seqq._ This, with most of the\r\nfacts here recorded, is taken either from Mr. Burgess’s descriptions of\r\nthe photographs in his ‘Visit to Somnath, Girnar, and other places in\r\nKathiawar,’ or Lieut. Postans’ ‘Journey,’ just referred to. Col. Tod’s\r\nfacts are too much mixed up with poetry to admit of their being quoted.\r\n\r\n[266] Mr. Burgess visited this place during the spring of the present\r\nyear, and has brought away plans and sections, from which it appears\r\nthese caves are old, but till his materials are published it is\r\nimpossible to state exactly how old they may be. I am afraid this work\r\nwill be published long before his Report.\r\n\r\n[267] Ram Raj, ‘Architecture of the Hindus,’ p. 49.\r\n\r\n[268] Burgess, ‘Visit to Girnar,’ &c., p. 3.\r\n\r\n[269] ‘Ferishta,’ translated by General Briggs, vol. i. p. 72.\r\nWilson, however (‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xvii. p. 194), is clearly\r\nof opinion that it was a lingam. One slight circumstance mentioned\r\nincidentally by Ferishta (p. 74) convinces me as clearly it was Jaina.\r\nAfter describing the destruction of the great idol, he goes on to say,\r\n“There were in the temple some thousands of small images, wrought\r\nin gold and silver, of various shapes and dimensions.” I know of no\r\nreligion except that of the Jains--and the very late Buddhists--who\r\nindulged in this excessive reduplication of images.\r\n\r\n[270] A view of this temple, not very correct but fairly illustrative\r\nof the style, forms the title-page to Col. Tod’s ‘Travels in Western\r\nIndia.’\r\n\r\n[271] See ‘Illustrations of Indian Architecture,’ by the Author, p. 30,\r\nfrom which work the plan and view are taken.\r\n\r\n[272] See _ante_, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[273] ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 357.\r\n\r\n[274] Ibid., plate 90.\r\n\r\n[275] The only person who has described these temples in any detail is\r\nGen. Cunningham, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 412, _et seqq._,\r\nfrom which consequently all that is here said is taken. I am also\r\nindebted to the General for a very complete set of photographs of these\r\ntemples, which enables me to speak of their appearance with confidence.\r\n\r\n[276] General Cunningham hesitates to adopt its extreme simplicity\r\nand rudeness as a test of its age, because it is built of granite,\r\nthe other in the exquisite stone of the neighbourhood. Its plan,\r\nhowever, and the forms of its sikras, induce me to believe it to be\r\nexceptionally old.\r\n\r\n[277] For plans of similar Jaina temples, see Mr. Burgess’s Report on\r\nBelgâm and Kuladgi, pls. 2, 10 and 45.

The figures thus given do not\r\nconsequently at all represent the facts of the case.\r\n\r\n[292] ‘Vie et Voyages,’ vol. i. p. 201, _et seqq._, vol. iii. p. 146,\r\n_et seqq._\r\n\r\n[293] Sir Walter Elliot and others have told me there are Buddhist\r\nremains in the south, and I know the general opinion is that this is\r\nso. I have never myself seen any, nor been able to obtain photographs\r\nor detailed information regarding them. When they are brought forward\r\nthese assertions may be modified. They, however, express in the\r\nmeanwhile our present knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\n[294] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. ix. p. 285.\r\n\r\n[295] These three were engraved in ‘Moor’s Pantheon,’ plates 73 and 74,\r\nin 1810.

When writing\r\nthe descriptions of these plates, I was struck with, and pointed out,\r\nthe curiously exceptional nature of the style of that temple, and its\r\naffinities with the style of Nepal; but I had no idea then that it was\r\nbelow, and not above, the Ghâts, and far from being exceptional in the\r\ncountry where it was situated. In fact, one of the great difficulties\r\nin writing a book like the present is to avoid making mistakes of this\r\nsort. Photographers are frequently so careless in naming the views they\r\nare making, and mounters frequently more so, in transferring the right\r\nnames to the mounts, that in very many instances photographs come to me\r\nwith names that have no connexion with the subjects; and it is only by\r\ncareful comparison, aided with extraneous knowledge, that grave errors\r\ncan be avoided.\r\n\r\n[301] ‘Travels in the Himalayan Provinces and in Ladakh and Kashmir,’\r\nLondon, Murray, 1841.\r\n\r\n[302] ‘Travels in Kashmir, Ladak,’ &c., two vols. 8vo., London,\r\nColburn, 1842.\r\n\r\n[303] ‘Travels in Kashmir and the Punjab.’ Translated by Major Jervis,\r\nLondon, 1845.\r\n\r\n[304] ‘Illustrations of the Ancient Buildings in Kashmir,’ &c.,\r\nprepared, under the authority of the Secretary of State for India in\r\nCouncil, by Lieut.

True,\r\nthe style of the two temples is different; but when I saw the one I did\r\nnot know of the existence of the other, and did not, as I now should,\r\nexamine the details with that care which alone would enable any one to\r\npronounce definitely regarding their affinities.\r\n\r\n[315] Troyer’s ‘Translation,’ lib. iii., v. 462.\r\n\r\n[316] Troyer’s ‘Translation,’ lib. iv., v. 126-371.\r\n\r\n[317] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. 49.\r\n\r\n[318] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p. 47.\r\n\r\n[319] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. 61.

Hodgson\r\none of the most acute observers that ever graced the Bengal Civil\r\nService. At the time, however, when he was Resident in the valley, none\r\nof the questions mooted in this work can be said to have been started;\r\nand he was mainly engrossed in exploring and communicating to others\r\nthe unsuspected wealth of Buddhist learning which he found in Nepal,\r\nand the services he rendered to this cause are incalculably great. Nor\r\ndid he neglect the architecture. I have before me a short manuscript\r\nessay on the subject, only four sheets foolscap, with about one hundred\r\nillustrations, which, if fully worked out, would be nearly all that is\r\nrequired. Unfortunately there are neither dates nor dimensions, and the\r\nessay is so short, and the drawings, made by natives, so incomplete,\r\nthat it does not supply what is wanted; but, if worked out on the spot\r\nand supplemented by photographs, it might be all that is required.\r\n\r\n[328] A curious mistake occurs in Buchanan Hamilton’s ‘Account of the\r\nKingdom of Nepal.’ At page 57 he says: “Gautama, according to the best\r\nauthorities, lived in the sixth century B.C., and Sakya\r\nin the first century A.D. The doctrines of Sakya Singha\r\ndiffer most essentially from those of Gautama.” In the writings of any\r\nother man this would be put down as a stupid mistake, but he was so\r\ncareful an observer that it is evident that his informers confounded\r\nthe founder of the Saka era--whether he was Kanishka or not--with the\r\nfounder of the religion, though they seem to be perfectly aware of\r\nthe novelty of the doctrines introduced by Nagárjuna and the fourth\r\nconvocation. He adds, page 190, that Buddhism was introduced into Nepal\r\nA.D. 33, which is probably, however, fifty years too early--if, at\r\nleast, it was consequent on the fourth convocation.\r\n\r\n[329] Buchanan Hamilton, ‘Account of the Kingdom of Nepal,’ p. 12.\r\n\r\n[330] Ibid., p. 49.\r\n\r\n[331] Buchanan Hamilton, ‘Account of the Kingdom of Nepal,’ p. 190.\r\n\r\n[332] Ibid., p. 22.\r\n\r\n[333] Ibid., pp. 35 and 211.\r\n\r\n[334] A view of this temple from the frontispiece of Buchanan\r\nHamilton’s volume.\r\n\r\n[335] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. v.

The one at Bharhut seems to have contained the thrones\r\nor altars of the four last Buddhas.\r\n\r\n[365] Among the sculptures of the Gandhara monasteries are several\r\nrepresenting façades of buildings. They may be cells or chaitya halls,\r\nbut, at all events, they are almost exact reproductions of the façade\r\nof this rath. Being used as frameworks for sculpture, the northern\r\nexamples are, of course, conventionalised; but it is impossible to\r\nmistake the identity of intention. They may probably be of about the\r\nsame age.\r\n\r\n[366] Burgess, ‘Report on Belgam,’ &c., p. 24.\r\n\r\n[367] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ p. 73.\r\n\r\n[368] If it were possible to rouse the Madras Government to take any\r\ninterest in such matters, it might be hoped they would replace the head\r\nof the great Naga on his body before it is destroyed by being made a\r\ncockshy for idle Britishers.\r\n\r\n[369] In Daniell’s plates, No. 16, the upper part of this is shown.\r\nBeing cut in the rock no addition or alteration could afterwards have\r\nbeen intended.\r\n\r\n[370] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. ix. p.\r\n314, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[371] ‘Report on Belgam and Kaladji,’ 1874, p. 31, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[372] There are four photographs of this temple in the ‘Architectural\r\nAntiquities of Dharwar and Mysore,’ plates 54-57. One of these is\r\nrepeated in Mr. Burgess’s book, plate 38.\r\n\r\n[373] Several photographs of it will be found in Capt. Lyon’s\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n[374] Capt. Lyon was employed by Government for this purpose, and made\r\n276 photographs of these temples. Fourteen sets were furnished to\r\nGovernment, but, owing to difficulties which occurred in bringing them\r\nout, they can hardly be said to be published--in this country at least.\r\n\r\n[375] As the plan is only an eye-sketch, and the dimensions obtained by\r\npacing, it must not be too much relied on. It is sufficient to explain\r\nthe text, and that is all that is at present required.\r\n\r\n[376] Inscription on gateway.\r\n\r\n[377] The dimensions of this image are 16 ft. from muzzle to rump, by\r\nabove 7 ft. across, 12 ft. 2 in. to top of head, 10 ft. 4 in. to top\r\nof hump, and 7 ft. 5 in. to top of back. It is composed of a single\r\nblock of stone, I believe granite, but it has been so frequently and so\r\nthoroughly coated with oil, which is daily applied to it, that it looks\r\nlike bronze. I tried to remove a portion of this epidermis in order to\r\nascertain what was beneath, but was not successful. No other kind of\r\nstone, however, is used in any other part of the temple.\r\n\r\n[378] Though so very important in Dravidian history, we have not even\r\nnow a correct list of the Chola kings from the year 1000 downwards.\r\nThere certainly is not one among the Mackenzie MSS. The late Mr.\r\nEllis, it is said, had one, but he determined not to publish anything\r\nbefore he was forty years of age, and before that time he swallowed a\r\nbottleful of laudanum by mistake, and was found dead in his bed one\r\nmorning. His papers served his successor’s cook to light fires for some\r\nyears afterwards.\r\n\r\n[379] Except this dimension, which is from a survey, and those of the\r\ngopuras, the dimensions above quoted must be taken _cum grano_. They\r\nwere obtained only by pacing and eye-sketching.\r\n\r\n[380] A drawing of it was published in my ‘Picturesque Illustrations of\r\nIndian Architecture.’ It has since been frequently photographed.\r\n\r\n[381] ‘Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindustan,’\r\np. 60.\r\n\r\n[382] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. viii. p. 7.\r\n\r\n[383] ‘Madras Journal,’ No. 20, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[384] Its dimensions, as nearly as can be ascertained from my paces,\r\nand Admiral Paris’ plans, are 340 ft. by 180 ft.\r\n\r\n[385] The plan of this temple (Woodcut No. 200) is taken from one in\r\nthe ‘Journal of the Geographical Society of Bombay,’ vol. vii., and may\r\nbe depended upon in so far as dimensions and general arrangements are\r\nconcerned. The officers who made it were surveyors, but, unfortunately,\r\nnot architects, and photographs since made reveal certain discrepancies\r\nof detail which prove it to require revision by some one on the spot.\r\n\r\n[386] There is a view of it in the Atlas of plates that accompanies\r\nLord Valentia’s travels; not very correct, but conveying a fair idea of\r\nits proportions.\r\n\r\n[387] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii. p. 202.\r\n\r\n[388] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii. p. 230, _et\r\nseqq._\r\n\r\n[389] Fortunately this choultrie is also one of the best known of\r\nIndian buildings. It was drawn by Daniell in the end of the last\r\ncentury, and his drawings have been repeated by Langles and others. It\r\nwas described by Mr. Blackadder in the ‘Archæologia,’ vol. x. p. 457;\r\nand by Wilson, ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii. p.\r\n232. Volumes of native drawings exist in some collections containing\r\nrepresentations of every pillar. A model in bronze of a porch exists at\r\nSouth Kensington Museum, and it has been abundantly photographed.\r\n\r\n[390] In the description of Tripe’s photograph this dimension is given\r\nas 117 ft.\r\n\r\n[391] Most of these particulars, with those that follow regarding the\r\ntemples, are taken from Capt. Lyon’s description of his photographs of\r\nthe places. He devotes twenty-six photos. to this temple alone.\r\n\r\n[392] The view in this temple in my ‘Picturesque Illustrations of\r\nIndian Architecture,’ No. 21, is taken from the corner of this tank.\r\n\r\n[393] There is a native plan of this temple in the India Museum, which\r\nmakes it very much more extensive than my inspection of the part I was\r\nallowed access to would have led me to suppose. I do not know, however,\r\nhow far the plan can be depended upon.\r\n\r\n[394] It is supposed, erroneously, I believe (‘Journal of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society,’ (N.S.) vol. vi. p. 265), to be the Kanchipuram\r\nvisited by Hiouen Thsang in 640. Nagapatam was more probably the place\r\nhe indicated.\r\n\r\n[395] I was too unwell when I visited Conjeveram to make so careful a\r\nsurvey of its temples as I would have wished to have done.\r\n\r\n[396] I have never been able to ascertain even approximately its\r\ndimensions. Hundreds visit it, many have photographed, some written\r\ndescriptions, but to measure dimensions and make even a sketch plan\r\nseems beyond the educational capacity of our countrymen.\r\n\r\n[397] When I was in Madras, and indeed up to the present year, the\r\ntemple on the hill of Tripetty or Tirupetty was reputed to be the\r\nrichest, the most magnificent, as it was certainly the most sacred\r\nof all those in the Presidency. So sacred, indeed, was it, that no\r\nunbelieving foreigner had ever been allowed to climb the holy hill\r\n(2500 ft. high) or profane its sacred precincts. In 1870, a party of\r\npolice forced their way in, in pursuit of a murderer who had taken\r\nrefuge there, and a Mr. Gribble, who accompanied them, published this\r\nyear (1875) an account of what they saw in the ‘Calcutta Review.’ As he\r\nexclaims, “Another of the illusions of my youth destroyed.” The temple\r\nis neither remarkable for its size nor its magnificence. In these\r\nrespects it is inferior to Conjeveram, Seringham, and many others; and\r\nwhatever may be done with its immense revenues, they certainly are not\r\napplied to its adornment. It is a fair specimen of a Dravidian temple\r\nof the second class, but in a sad state of dilapidation and disrepair.\r\n\r\n[398] What I know on this subject I have already said in my work on\r\n‘Rude Stone Monuments,’ p. 455, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[399] Some money was, I believe, expended during Lord Napier’s\r\nadministration on the repairs of this court and its appurtenances, but\r\nit was quite beyond the purview of an Anglo-Saxon to make a plan of the\r\nplace. It is, consequently, very difficult to describe it.\r\n\r\n[400] Description attached to Tripe’s Photographs.\r\n\r\n[401] Vol. i. (N.S.) p. 247, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[402] Professor Eggeling tells me he has great reason for suspecting\r\nthe date 411 for Palakesi I. (‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’\r\nvol. iv. p. 8) to be a forgery. There is something certainly wrong\r\nabout it, but how the error arose is not yet clear. It seems at least a\r\ncentury too early. See the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol.\r\niv. p. 12; ibid., vol. iv. (N.S.) p. 93.\r\n\r\n[403] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv. p. 10, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[404] Prinsep’s ‘Useful Tables,’ re-edited by Thomas, pp. 267-268.\r\n\r\n[405] If all the quadrants of this portico were equal the numbers ought\r\nto be 300, or 75 in each, but I fancy a considerable portion of two\r\nof them was cut off by the site of the temple. As I have nothing but\r\nphotographs to go by, and they only show the exterior, even this is\r\nuncertain, and the dimensions I cannot even guess at. They are very\r\nlarge, however, for a Hindu temple.\r\n\r\n[406] These dates are taken from a list of this dynasty among the\r\nMackenzie MSS., quoted by Prinsep, ‘Useful Tables,’ xli., and are\r\nconfirmed by the architectural evidence and other indications.\r\n\r\n[407] I regret that I have been unable to get a plan of this temple or,\r\nindeed, of any triple temple. That at Girnar (Woodcut No. 127) belongs\r\nto another religion, and is too far distant in locality to assist us\r\nhere. An imperfect one might be compiled from the photographs, but I\r\nhave not even an approximate dimension.\r\n\r\n[408] In a very few years this building will be entirely destroyed by\r\nthe trees, which have fastened their roots in the joints of the stones.\r\nIn a drawing in the Mackenzie collection in the India Office, made in\r\nthe early part of this century, the building is shown entire. Twenty\r\nyears ago it was as shown at p. 398. A subsequent photograph shows it\r\nalmost hidden; a few years more, if some steps are not taken to save\r\nit, it will have perished entirely. A very small sum would save it;\r\nand, as the country is in our charge, it is hoped that the expenditure\r\nwill not be grudged.\r\n\r\n[409] Plates 1 and 32-40. Published by Murray, 1864.\r\n\r\n[410] In 1848 Gen. Cunningham applied the term Aryan to the\r\narchitecture of Kashmir, apparently on the strength of a pun (‘Journal\r\nof the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ September, 1848, p. 242). This,\r\nhowever, was limiting a term that belongs to two continents to an\r\ninsignificant valley, in one of them. It was, besides, wholly uncalled\r\nfor. The term Kashmiri was amply sufficient, and all that was wanted\r\nfor so strictly local a style.\r\n\r\n[411] ‘Historical Sketch of Tahsil Fyzabad,’ by P. Carnegy, Lucknow,\r\n1870. Gen. Cunningham attempts to identify the various mounds\r\nat this place with those described as existing in Saketu by the\r\nBuddhist Pilgrims (‘Ancient Geography of India,’ p. 401, _et seqq._;\r\n‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 293, _et seqq._) The truth of the\r\nmatter, however, is, that neither Fa Hian nor Hiouen Thsang were ever\r\nnear the place. The city they visited, and where the Toothbrush-tree\r\ngrew, was the present city of Lucknow, which was the capital of the\r\nkingdom in Sakya Muni’s time.\r\n\r\n[412] ‘Sacred City of the Hindus,’ London, 1868, p. 271, _et seqq._;\r\n‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. xxxiv. p. 1, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[413] Curiously enough they make their appearance on the stage about\r\nthe same time, and both then complete and perfect in all their details.\r\n\r\n[414] ‘Hunter’s Orissa,’ vol. i. p. 233.\r\n\r\n[415] I regret very much being obliged to send this chapter to press\r\nbefore the receipt of the second volume of Babu Rajendra Lala Mittra’s\r\n‘Antiquities of Orissa.’ He accompanied a Government expedition to\r\nthat province in 1868 as archæologist, and being a Brahman and an\r\nexcellent Sanscrit scholar, he has had opportunities of ascertaining\r\nfacts such as no one else ever had. Orissa was the first province\r\nI visited in India for the purposes of antiquarian research, and\r\nlike every one else, I was then quite unfamiliar with the forms and\r\naffinities of Hindu architecture. Photographs have enabled me to supply\r\nto some extent the deficiency of my knowledge at that time; but unless\r\nphotographs are taken by a scientific man for scientific purposes,\r\nthey do not supply the place of local experience. I feel confident\r\nthat, on the spot, I could now ascertain the sequence of the temples\r\nwith perfect certainty; but whether the Babu has sufficient knowledge\r\nfor that purpose remains to be seen. His first volume is very learned,\r\nand may be very interesting, but it adds little or nothing to what we\r\nalready knew of the history of Orissan architecture.\r\n\r\nI have seen two plates of plans of temples intended for the second\r\nvolume. They are arranged without reference either to style or dates,\r\nso they convey very little information, and the photographs prove them\r\nto be so incorrect that no great dependence can be placed upon them.\r\nThe text, which I have not seen, may remedy all this, and I hope will,\r\nbut if he had made any great discoveries, such as the error in the date\r\nof the Black Pagoda, they most probably would have been hinted at in\r\nthe first volume, or have leaked out in some of the Babu’s numerous\r\npublications during the last seven or eight years.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter, who was in constant communication with the Babu, adds\r\nvery little in his work on Orissa to what we learnt long ago from\r\nStirling’s, which up to this hour remains the classical work on the\r\nprovince and its antiquities.\r\n\r\n[416] These particulars are taken, of course, from Stirling, ‘Asiatic\r\nResearches,’ vol. xv. pp. 263, 264. The whole evidence was embodied in\r\na paper on the Amravati tope, ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’\r\nvol. iii. (N.S.), p. 149, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[417] Hunter’s ‘Orissa,’ vol. i. p. 238.\r\n\r\n[418] This dimension is from Babu Rajendra’s ‘Orissan Antiquities,’\r\nvol. i. p. 41, but I don’t like it.\r\n\r\n[419] This and the dimensions in plan generally are taken from a\r\ntable in Babu Rajendra’s work, p. 41. I am afraid they are only round\r\nnumbers, and certainly incorrect, but they suffice for comparison.\r\n\r\n[420] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ plates 48-98.\r\n\r\n[421] Hunter’s ‘Orissa,’ vol. i. p. 237.\r\n\r\n[422] It is to be hoped that Babu Rajendra’s book may to some extent\r\nremedy this deficiency.

Even, however, if the case were\r\nmuch less strong than it appears to be, it by no means follows that\r\nwhat was only dimly shadowed forth in the Vedas may not have become an\r\naccepted fact in the Puranas, and an established dogma in Orissa in the\r\n9th century, when this temple was erected.\r\n\r\n[432] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. 330.\r\n\r\n[433] These discrepancies arise from the fact that the beams lie on the\r\nfloor buried under the ruins of the stone roof they once supported,\r\nand it is extremely difficult to get at them so as to obtain correct\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\n[434] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. 316.\r\n\r\n[435] Loc. cit., p. 265.\r\n\r\n[436] Tournour’s abstract of the Dalawanso in the ‘Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 856, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[437] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ v. 1. xv. p. 320.\r\n\r\n[438] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. 315.\r\n\r\n[439] The plan is reduced from one to a scale of 40 feet to 1 in., made\r\nby an intelligent native assistant to the Public Works Department,\r\nnamed Radhica Pursâd Mukerji, and is the only plan I ever found done by\r\na native sufficiently correct to be used, except as a diagram, or after\r\nserious doctoring.\r\n\r\n[440] Hunter, ‘Orissa,’ vol. i. p. 128.\r\n\r\n[441] News has just reached this country of a curious accident having\r\nhappened in this temple. Just after the gods had been removed from\r\ntheir Sinhasan to take their annual excursion to the Gundicha Nûr, some\r\nstones of the roof fell in, and would have killed any attendants and\r\nsmashed the gods had they not fortunately all been absent. Assuming\r\nthe interior of the Bara Dewul to be as represented (Woodcut No. 124),\r\nit is not easy to see how this could have happened. But in the same\r\nwoodcut the porch or Jagamohan of the Kanaruc pagoda is represented\r\nwith a flat false roof, which has fallen, and now encumbers the floor\r\nof the apartment. That roof, however, was formed of stone laid on iron\r\nbeams, and looked as if it could only have been shaken down by an\r\nearthquake. I have little doubt that a similar false roof was formed\r\nsomeway up the tower over the altar at Puri, but formed probably of\r\nstone laid on wooden beams and either decay or the white ants having\r\ndestroyed the timber, the stones have fallen as narrated.\r\n\r\nA similar roof so supported on wooden beams still exists in the\r\nstructural temple on the shore at Mahavellipore, and, I have no doubt,\r\nelsewhere, but it is almost impossible to get access to these cells\r\nwhen the gods are at home, and the places are so dark it is equally\r\nimpossible to see, except when in ruins, how they were roofed.\r\n\r\n[442] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xv. p. 367.\r\n\r\n[443] Ibid., p. 335; Hunter’s ‘Orissa,’ vol. i. p. 266.\r\n\r\n[444] ‘Ayeen Akbery,’ Gladwin’s translation, vol. ii. p. 13.\r\n\r\n[445] These dimensions, except those of Kanaruc, are taken from a table\r\nin Babu Rajendra’s ‘Antiquities of Orissa,’ vol. i. p. 41, and are\r\nsufficient to give an idea of the relative size of the building. So far\r\nas I can make out they are taken from angle to angle of the towers, but\r\nas they all have projections on their faces, when cubed, as is done\r\nin the table referred to, they are much too small. I may also observe\r\nthat I know of no instance in which the two dimensions differ. The four\r\nfaces are always, I believe, alike. The dates are my own; none are\r\ngiven, except for the great temple, in the Babu’s first volume.\r\n\r\n[446] The two works on this subject are the ‘Architectural History of\r\nDharwar and Mysore,’ fol., 100 plates, Murray, 1866, and Burgess’s\r\n‘Report on the Belgam and Kuladgi Districts,’ 1874. Considering the\r\ntime available and the means at his disposal, Mr. Burgess did wonders,\r\nbut it is no dispraise to say that he has not, nor could any man in his\r\nplace, exhaust so vast a subject.\r\n\r\n[447] For architectural purposes the three places may be considered\r\nas one. Aiwulli is five or six miles north of Badami, and Purudkul or\r\nPittadkul as far south. Ten miles covers the whole, which must have\r\nbeen in the 6th or 7th century a place of great importance--possibly\r\nWatipipura, the capital of the Chalukyas in the 5th or 6th century. See\r\n‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv. p. 9.\r\n\r\n[448] ‘Histoire de Hiouen Thsang,’ p. 255; ‘Vie et Voyages,’ vol. i. p.\r\n280.\r\n\r\n[449] ‘Report on the District of Belgam and Kuladgi.’ 1874.\r\n\r\n[450] When I originally wrote on the subject I thought I had the 9th\r\nand 10th centuries at my disposal. It now appears they must be blotted\r\nout as non-existent for any historical or artistic purpose.\r\n\r\n[451] This is the date given by Mr. Burgess in his description in ‘The\r\nCaves at Elephanta,’ Bombay, 1871, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[452] ‘Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. ii. pl. 4.\r\n\r\n[453] Loc. cit., pl. 6.\r\n\r\n[454] Burgess, ‘Report on Belgam,’ &c. pl. 31.\r\n\r\n[455] Loc. cit., pls. 20, 23, 40.\r\n\r\n[456] ‘Tree and Serpent Worship,’ pl. 76.\r\n\r\n[457] Burgess, ‘Report on Belgam and Kuladji,’ pl. 31.\r\n\r\n[458] A view of this was published in my ‘Picturesque Illustrations of\r\nIndian Architecture,’ pl. 5.\r\n\r\n[459] Tod’s ‘Annals of Rajastan,’ vol. ii. p. 734.\r\n\r\n[460] ‘Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindostan,’\r\npl. 6, with description. Gen. Cunningham (‘Archæological Reports,’ vol.\r\nii. p. 264) agrees with me as to the date, but inadvertently adds a\r\nscale to his plan which makes the building ten times larger than I made\r\nit, or than it really is.\r\n\r\n[461] Tod (loc. cit.) gives several plates of the details of the porch\r\nby a native artist--fairly well drawn, but wanting shadow to render\r\nthem intelligible.\r\n\r\n[462] Tod’s ‘Annals of Rajastan,’ vol. ii. p. 712.\r\n\r\n[463] A view of this temple will be found in my ‘Picturesque\r\nIllustrations of Indian Architecture,’ pl. 4.\r\n\r\n[464] We are indebted to Gen. Cunningham for almost all we know about\r\nthis place, and it is from his ‘Reports’ and photographs that the\r\nfollowing account has been compiled.\r\n\r\n[465] Cunningham, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p 420.\r\n\r\n[466] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. ix. p. 548.\r\nThe date is given from four different epochs, so that there can be no\r\nmistake about it.\r\n\r\n[467] A portion of the casts are in the South Kensington Museum.\r\nTranscripts from the drawings were published in the ‘Indian Antiquary,’\r\nvol. iii. p. 316.\r\n\r\n[468] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. ix. p.\r\n219.\r\n\r\n[469] Ibid., vol. ix. p. 221.\r\n\r\n[470] Both these temples are illustrated to a considerable extent in\r\nLieut.

Some\r\nparts have been misunderstood by the engraver, but on the whole it\r\nrepresents the building fairly.\r\n\r\n[476] A view of one of these is given in my ‘Illustrations of Ancient\r\nArchitecture in India,’ plate 15. Other illustrations will be found in\r\n‘L’Inde des Rajahs,’ p. 187, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[477] Erskine’s ‘Memoirs of Baber,’ p. 384.\r\n\r\n[478] These particulars are taken from Cunningham’s ‘Archæological\r\nReports,’ vol. ii. p. 346, _et seqq._, plates 87 and 88.\r\n\r\n[479] How far anything of all this now exists is by no means clear. We\r\noccupied the fort during the mutiny, and have retained it ever since.\r\nThe first thing done was to occupy the Barradurri as a mess-room: to\r\nfit up portions of the palace for military occupation; then to build a\r\nrange of barracks, and clear away a lot of antiquarian rubbish to make\r\na parade ground. What all this means is only too easily understood.\r\nM. Rousselet--no unfriendly critic--observes:--“Les Anglais sont\r\ntrès-activement occupés à simplifier la besogne de l’archéologue, et\r\nà faire disparaître ce précieux document de l’histoire de l’Inde;\r\ndéjà toutes les constructions à la gauche de la porte de l’est sont\r\nlivrées à la pioche et le même sort est réservé au reste” (‘L’Inde des\r\nRajahs,’ p. 362). And, again: “Mais, hélas! l’Ourwahaï lui aussi a\r\nvécu. Quand j’y revins en Décembre, 1867, les arbres étaient coupés,\r\nles statues volaient en éclats, sous les pics des travailleurs, et le\r\nravin se remplissait des talus d’une nouvelle route construite par les\r\nAnglais--talus dans lesquels dorment les palais des Chandelas et des\r\nTomars, les idoles des Bouddhistes et des Jainas.”--Loc. cit. p. 366.\r\n\r\n[480] A plan of it is given in Lieut. Cole’s ‘Report on the Buildings\r\nnear Agra’--correct as far as it goes, but not complete.\r\n\r\n[481] Egypt showed little taste for architectural display till she fell\r\nunder the sway of the Memlook Sultans, and Saracenic architecture in\r\nPersia practically commences with the Seljukians.\r\n\r\n[482] ‘Architecture of Beejapore.

The gate in front is probably modern, and\r\nthe foiled arches in the background appear to be the only parts that\r\nbelong to the 11th century.\r\n\r\n[487] The tradition that these gates were of sandal-wood, and brought\r\nfrom Somnath, is entirely disproved by the fact of their being of the\r\nlocal pine-wood, as well as by the style of decoration, which has no\r\nresemblance to Hindu work.\r\n\r\n[488] An excellent representation of the gates will be found in the\r\nsecond edition of ‘Marco Polo’s Travels,’ by Col. Yule, vol. ii. p. 390.\r\n\r\n[489] See translation of the inscription on these minars, ‘Journal of\r\nthe Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ No. 134, for 1843.\r\n\r\n[490] Two are represented by Dubois de Montpéreux, ‘Voyage autour du\r\nCaucase.’\r\n\r\n[491] _Vide ante_, vol. ii. p. 444, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[492] _Vide ante_, vol. i. p. 387, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[493] I do not know why Gen. Cunningham should go out of his\r\nway to prove that the Ajmir mosque is larger than that at Delhi\r\n(‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 260). His remarks apply only\r\nto the inner court at Delhi, which may have been the whole mosque as\r\noriginally designed; but before the death of Altumsh, who was the real\r\nbuilder of both, the screen of arches at Delhi had been extended to 380\r\nft. as compared with the 200 ft. at Ajmir, and the courtyards of the\r\ntwo mosques are nearly in the same proportion, their whole superficial\r\narea being 72,000 ft. at Ajmir, as compared with 152,000 ft. at Delhi.\r\n\r\n[494] Gen. Cunningham found an inscription on the wall recording that\r\ntwenty-seven temples of the Hindus had been pulled down to provide\r\nmaterials for this mosque (‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 176).\r\nThis, however, proves little, unless we know what the temples were like\r\nwhich were destroyed for this purpose. Twenty-seven temples like those\r\nat Khajurâho, excepting the Ganthai, would not provide pillars for one\r\nhalf the inner court. One temple like that at Sadri would supply a\r\nsufficiency for the whole mosque, and though the latter is more modern,\r\nwe have no reason for supposing that similar temples may not have\r\nexisted before Mahomedan times.\r\n\r\n[495] This mode of construction is only feasible when much larger\r\nstones are used than were here employed. The consequence was that\r\nthe arch had become seriously crippled when I saw and sketched it.\r\nIt has since been carefully restored by Government under efficient\r\nsuperintendence, and is now as sound and complete as when first\r\nerected. The two great side arches either were never completed, or have\r\nfallen down in consequence of the false mode of construction.\r\n\r\n[496] ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. iv. p. 313. Its present height,\r\naccording to Gen. Cunningham, is (after the removal of the modern\r\npavilion) 238 ft. 1 in. (‘Archæological Reports,’ vol i. p. 196).\r\n\r\n[497] Translated by Walter Ewer, ‘Asiatic Researches,’ vol. xiv. p.\r\n480. See also Cunningham, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. i. p. 132, _et\r\nseqq._\r\n\r\n[498] It is a curious illustration how difficult it sometimes is\r\nto obtain correct information in India, that when Gen. Cunningham\r\npublished his ‘Reports’ in 1871, he stated, apparently on the authority\r\nof Mr. Cooper, Deputy Commissioner, that an excavation had been carried\r\ndown to a depth of 26 ft., but without reaching the bottom. “The man\r\nin charge, however”--_témoin oculaire_--“assured him that the actual\r\ndepth reached was 35 ft.”--Vol. i. p. 169. He consequently estimated\r\nthe whole length at 60 ft., but fortunately ordered a new excavation,\r\ndetermined to reach the bottom--_coûte qui coûte_--and found it at\r\n20 inches below the surface.--Vol. iv. p. 28, pl. 5. At a distance\r\nof a few inches below the surface it expands in a bulbous form to a\r\ndiameter of 2 ft. 4 in., and rests on a gridiron of iron bars, which\r\nare fastened with lead into the stone pavement.\r\n\r\n[499] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vii. p. 629.\r\n\r\n[500] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. x. p.\r\n64. These two translations are painfully discrepant in detail, though\r\nagreeing sufficiently as to the main facts. On the whole, I am inclined\r\nto think Bhau Daji’s the most correct, though I agree with Prinsep in\r\nbelieving that the more archaic form of the letters is owing to their\r\nbeing punched with a cold chisel on the iron, instead of being engraved\r\nas those on stone always were.\r\n\r\n[501] There is no mistake about the pillar being of pure iron. Gen.\r\nCunningham had a bit of it analysed in India by Dr. Murray, and another\r\nportion was analysed in the School of Mines here by Dr. Percy. Both\r\nfound it pure malleable iron without any alloy.\r\n\r\n[502] Can these Balhikas be the dynasty we have hitherto known as the\r\nSah kings of Saurastra? They certainly were settled on the lower Indus\r\nfrom about the year A.D. 79, and were expelled, according to their own\r\ndates, A.D. 264 or 371. (See ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ vol. viii. p. 28.) My impression is, that this may ultimately\r\nprove to be the true solution of the riddle.\r\n\r\n[503] The same form of pendentive is found at Serbistan (Woodcut No.\r\n946, vol. ii.), nearly ten centuries before this time.\r\n\r\n[504] Cunningham, ‘Archæological Reports,’ vol. ii. p. 261.\r\n\r\n[505] I am sorry to differ from Gen. Cunningham on this matter. He has\r\nseen the mosque--I have not; but I have photographs and drawings of it,\r\nand directed Mr. Burgess’s attention especially to this point when he\r\nvisited it, and the result is a conviction on my mind that the pillars\r\nnow standing are unaltered in arrangement.\r\n\r\nTod, in his ‘Annals,’ treats it simply as a Jaina temple, without\r\nreferring to any possible alterations, except additions made by Moslem\r\narchitects, vol. i. p. 779, see also his plate, which is singularly\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n[506] Owing to the Hindu part being undisturbed, and the Mahomedan part\r\nbetter built and with larger materials, the mosque is not in the same\r\nruinous condition as that at the Kutub was before the late repairs.\r\nIt is, however, in a filthy and neglected state, and might at a very\r\nslight outlay be preserved from further dilapidation, and its beauties\r\nvery much enhanced. There is, so far as I can judge, no building in\r\nIndia more worthy of the attention of Government than this. The kind\r\nof care, however, that is bestowed upon it may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing extract from a private letter from a gentleman high in the\r\nGovernment service in India, and one perfectly well informed as to\r\nwhat he was writing about: “Have you ever heard that some of the Hindu\r\npillars of the great mosque at Ajmir were dragged from their places (I\r\npresume they were fallen pillars), and set up as a triumphal arch on\r\nthe occasion of Lord Mayo’s visit? and have you heard that they were so\r\ninsecurely converted that nobody dared to go under them, and that Lord\r\nMayo and the inspired---- of architects went round it?” This is more\r\nthan confirmed in a public letter by Sir John Strachey, Lieut.-Governor\r\nof the North-West Provinces, addressed to Lord Northbrook, on 25th\r\nAugust last. In this he speaks of “an over zealous district officer\r\nwho, not long ago, actually pulled down the sculptured columns of a\r\nwell-known temple of great antiquity”--the Arhai din ka Jhompra--“with\r\nthe object of decorating a temporary triumphal arch through which the\r\nViceroy was to pass.” He then proceeds to quote what Rousselet says\r\nregarding our neglect of such monuments, which is not one whit too\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n[507] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. xxxiv. p. 1, _et\r\nseqq._, pls. 1-8. It is to me inconceivable that any one looking at\r\nthese plates, especially the plans, pls. 7 and 8, can see anything in\r\nthem but the usual tomb of a Mahomedan noble of the 15th century with\r\nits accompanying mosque.\r\n\r\n[508] These dimensions are taken from the text and a plan of the\r\nbuilding in Montgomery Martin’s edition of Buchanan Hamilton’s\r\n‘Statistical Account of Shahabad,’ vol. i. p. 425. The plan is,\r\nhowever, so badly drawn that it can hardly be reproduced.\r\n\r\n[509] The first to suggest this was the Baron Hügel, though his\r\nknowledge of the subject was so slight that his opinion would not have\r\nhad much weight. The idea was, however, taken up afterwards and warmly\r\nadvocated by the late Mr. Horne, B.C.S., and the Rev. Mr. Sherring, in\r\na series of papers in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’\r\nvol. xxxiv. p. 1, _et seqq._, and by the latter in his work on ‘The\r\nsacred city of the Hindus,’ p. 283, and elsewhere. They have hitherto\r\nfailed to adduce a single example of similar pillars existing in any\r\nauthentic Buddhist or Jaina building--they mean Jaina, though they say\r\nBuddhist--or any historical or other evidence that will bear a moment’s\r\nexamination. There may have been some Jaina or Hindu buildings at\r\nJaunpore of the 13th or 14th centuries that may have been utilised by\r\nthe Mahomedans, but certainly nine-tenths at least of the pillars in\r\nthese mosques were made at the time they were required for the places\r\nthey now occupy.\r\n\r\n[510] A view of this mosque will be found in Kittoe’s ‘Indian\r\nArchitecture,’ but, unfortunately, no plan or dimensions. That quoted\r\nin the text is from memory.\r\n\r\n[511] A view of it, but not a good one, is given in Daniell’s plates.\r\nIt is partially seen in Woodcut No. 291.\r\n\r\n[512] If the buildings of the Bakaraya Kund had been found within\r\ntwenty miles of Ahmedabad, where there are dozens exactly like them,\r\nthey would hardly have deserved a passing remark. Any one familiar\r\nwith the style would have assigned them a date--A.D. 1450,\r\nor thereabouts--and would hardly have troubled himself to inquire who\r\nbuilt them, they are so like all others of the same age.\r\n\r\n[513] General Cunningham’s ‘Reports’ for 1862-63, vol. i. p. 287. From\r\nthis I learn that the pillars surrounding the court on three sides have\r\nbeen removed since I saw them in 1836--this time, however, not by the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n[514] See plate in Forbes’ ‘Oriental Memoirs,’ vol. iii. ch. xxx.\r\n\r\n[515] As it is impossible by a woodcut to convey an impression of the\r\nbeauty of these mosques, the reader is referred to the photographs of\r\n‘Architecture of Ahmedabad,’ &c.\r\n\r\n[516] Described further on, p. 538, Woodcuts Nos. 306 and 307.\r\n\r\n[517] I understand from Mr. Burgess that, during his recent visit\r\nto Ahmedabad, he copied a number of inscriptions from the mosques\r\nthere which prove that some of the names given to the buildings are\r\nerroneous. When these are published new names and dates must in some\r\ninstances be given to several of the buildings, but the alterations, as\r\nI understand it, are not very important.\r\n\r\n[518] All the particulars above quoted regarding that mosque are\r\nderived from a work published in Bombay in 1868, entitled, ‘Surat,\r\nBaroach, and other old Cities of Goojerat.’ By T. C. Hope, B.C.S.\r\nIllustrated by photographs, plans, and with descriptive text.\r\n\r\n[519] Plans of these are in Mr. Hope’s work.\r\n\r\n[520] There is a very good view of the tomb in Mr. Grindlay’s ‘Views\r\nof the East’; but the plan and details here given are from Mr. Hope’s\r\nwork, sup. cit.\r\n\r\n[521] A view of this palace, but not from the best point of view, will\r\nbe found in Elliot’s ‘Views in the East.’\r\n\r\n[522] In this respect it is something like the curvilinear pediments\r\nwhich Roman and Italian architects employed as window heads. Though\r\ndetestable in themselves, yet we use and admire them because we are\r\naccustomed to them.\r\n\r\n[523] These particulars are taken principally from Buchanan Hamilton’s\r\n‘Statistics of Dinajepore,’ published by Montgomery Martin in his\r\n‘Eastern India,’ 1838, vol. ii. p. 649, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[524] Page 347, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[525] Initial coinage of Bengal, by Edward Thomas, B.C.S. 1866.\r\n\r\n[526] In the woodcut, though not so clearly as in the photograph, will\r\nbe observed the long pendent root of the tree which has been planted by\r\nsome bird in the upper gallery. In another year or two it will reach\r\nthe ground, and then down comes the minar. Any one with a pocket-knife\r\nmight save it by five minutes’ work. But _Cui bono?_ says the Saxon.\r\n\r\n[527] _Ante_, p. 393.\r\n\r\n[528] Elphinstone’s ‘India,’ vol. ii. p. 57.\r\n\r\n[529] For the plan and section of this mosque, and all indeed I know\r\nabout it, I am indebted to my friend the Hon. Sir Arthur Gordon, at\r\npresent governor of the Fiji Islands. He made the plans himself, and\r\nmost liberally placed them at my disposal.\r\n\r\n[530] I have photographs, but no measurements, of this street.\r\n\r\n[531] Brigg’s translation of Ferishta, vol. ii. p. 510.\r\n\r\n[532] There is a view of it from a sketch by Col. Meadows Taylor, in\r\nthe ‘Oriental Annual’ for 1840.\r\n\r\n[533] Bijapur has been singularly fortunate, not only in the\r\nextent, but in the mode in which it has been illustrated. A set\r\nof drawings--plans, elevations, and details--were made by a Mr.\r\nA. Cumming, C.E., under the superintendence of Capt. Hart, Bombay\r\nEngineers, which, for beauty of drawing and accuracy of detail, are\r\nunsurpassed by any architectural drawings yet made in India. These\r\nwere reduced by photography, and published by me at the expense of\r\nthe Government in 1859, in a folio volume with seventy-four plates,\r\nand afterwards in 1866 at the expense of the Committee for the\r\nPublication of the Antiquities of Western India, illustrated further by\r\nphotographic views taken on the spot by Col. Biggs, R.A.\r\n\r\n[534] _Ante_, vol. ii. p. 553.\r\n\r\n[535] Adopting the numerical scale described in the introduction to the\r\n‘True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ p. 140, I estimated the Parthenon\r\nas possessing 4 parts of technic value, 4 of æsthetic, and 4 phonetic,\r\nor 24 as its index number, being the highest known. The Taje I should\r\non the contrary estimate as possessing 4 technic, 5 æsthetic, and 2\r\nphonetic, not that it has any direct phonetic mode of utterance, but\r\nfrom the singular and pathetic distinctness with which every part of it\r\ngives utterance to the sorrow and affection it was erected to express.\r\nIts index number would consequently be 20, which is certainly as high\r\nas it can be brought, and near enough to the Parthenon for comparison\r\nat least.\r\n\r\n[536] ‘Memoirs,’ translated by Erskine, p. 334.\r\n\r\n[537] Loc. cit., pp. 341-2.\r\n\r\n[538] Brigg’s translation, vol. ii. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[539] Cunningham, ‘Reports,’ vol. i. p. 222.\r\n\r\n[540] A description of this mosque is given in Mr. Carllyle’s ‘Report\r\non the Buildings of Delhi,’ forming part of Cunningham’s fourth\r\nvolume, but like everything else most unsatisfactory. Neither plan nor\r\ndimensions are given, mere verbiage conveying no distinct meaning.\r\n\r\n[541] As I cannot find any trace of this building in Keene’s\r\ndescription of the fort in his third book on Agra, I presume it must\r\nhave been utilised since my day. Unless it is the building he calls\r\nthe Nobut Khana of Akbar’s palace (26). I have never seen it in any\r\nphotograph of the place.\r\n\r\n[542] It is not quite clear how much Rhotasgur owes its magnificence\r\nto Shere Shah, how much to Akbar; both certainly built there, and\r\non the spot it might easily be ascertained how much belongs to\r\neach. Unfortunately, the part that belongs to the British is too\r\neasily ascertained. “They converted the beautiful Dewan Khand,\r\nof which Daniell published a drawing, into a stable for breeding\r\nhorses.”--Hamilton’s ‘Gazetteer,’ _sub voce_.\r\n\r\n[543] I have mislaid the measurements and plan I made of this building;\r\nand, as neither Gen. Cunningham nor his assistants give either plan or\r\ndimensions, I am unable to quote any figures in the text.\r\n\r\n[544] The plan is taken from one by Gen. Cunningham (‘Reports,’ vol.\r\nii., plate 91). He omits, however, these square projections. I have\r\nadded them from the photographs.\r\n\r\n[545] An attempt has lately been made by Gen. Cunningham and his\r\nassistants (‘Reports,’ vol. iv. p. 124), to ascribe this palace to\r\nJehangir. On what authority is not stated; but unless it is very clear\r\nand distinct, I must decline to admit it. The whole evidence, so far as\r\nI can judge, is directly opposed to such an hypothesis. There is a plan\r\nof this palace, in his ‘Reports,’ vol. iv., plate 8.\r\n\r\n[546] A cast of this throne is in the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\n[547] Photographs of this palace are now common, and can be obtained\r\nanywhere; and recently Lieut. Cole’s ‘Report on Buildings in the\r\nNeighbourhood of Agra’ supplies some very interesting new ones with\r\nplans, from which the dimensions in the text are quoted.\r\n\r\n[548] No plan or section of this tomb has ever, so far as I know, been\r\npublished, though it has been in our possession for nearly a century.\r\nThose here given are from my own measurements, and, though they may\r\nbe correct as far as they go, are not so detailed as those of such a\r\nmonument ought to be, and would have been, had it been in the hands of\r\nany other European nation.\r\n\r\n[549] The diagram is probably sufficient to explain the text, but must\r\nnot be taken as pretending to be a correct architectural drawing.\r\nThere were parts, such as the height of the lower dome and upper angle\r\nkiosks, I had no means of measuring, and after all, I was merely making\r\nmemoranda for my own satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[550] After the above was written, and the diagram drawn (Woodcut No.\r\n334), I was not a little pleased to find the following entry in Mr.\r\nFinch’s journal. He resided in Agra for some years, and visited the\r\ntomb for the last time apparently in 1609, and after describing most\r\nfaithfully all its peculiarities up to the upper floor, as it now\r\nstands, adds: “At my last sight thereof there was only overhead a rich\r\ntent with a Semaine over the tomb. But it is to be _inarched_ over with\r\nthe most curious white and speckled marble, and to be seeled all within\r\nwith pure sheet gold richly inwrought.”--‘Purchas, his Pilgrims,’ vol.\r\ni. p. 440.\r\n\r\n[551] Although the fact seems hardly now to be doubted, no very\r\ndirect evidence has yet been adduced to prove that it was to\r\nforeign--Florentine--artists that the Indians owe the art of inlaying\r\nin precious stones generally known as work in “pietro duro.” Austin\r\nor Augustin de Bordeaux, is the only European artist whose name can\r\npositively be identified with any works of the class. He certainly was\r\nemployed by Shah Jehan at Delhi, and executed that mosaic of Orpheus\r\nor Apollo playing to the beasts, after Raphael’s picture, which once\r\nadorned the throne there, and is now in the Indian Museum at South\r\nKensington.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, hardly to be expected that natives should record the\r\nnames of those who surpassed them in their own arts; and needy Italian\r\nadventurers were even less likely to have an opportunity of recording\r\nthe works they executed in a strange and foreign country. Had any\r\nItalian who lived at the courts of Jehangir or Shah Jehan written a\r\nbook, he might have recorded the artistic prowess of his countrymen,\r\nbut none such, so far as I am aware, has yet seen light.\r\n\r\nThe internal evidence, however, seems complete. Up to the erection of\r\nthe gates to Akbar’s tomb at Secundra in the first ten years of\r\nJehangir’s reign, A.D. 1605-1615, we have infinite mosaics of coloured\r\nmarble, but no specimen of “inlay.” In Eti-mad-Doulah’s tomb, A.D.\r\n1615-1628, we have both systems in great perfection. In the Taje and\r\npalaces at Agra and Delhi, built by Shah Jehan, A.D. 1628-1668, the\r\nmosaic has disappeared, being entirely supplanted by the “inlay.” It was\r\njust before that time that the system of inlaying called “pietro duro”\r\nwas invented, and became the rage at Florence and, in fact, all\r\nthroughout Europe; and we know that during the reign of the two\r\nlast-named monarchs many Italian artists were in their service quite\r\ncapable of giving instruction in the new art.\r\n\r\n[552] Something of the same sort occurred when the Turks occupied\r\nConstantinople. They adapted the architecture of the Christians to\r\ntheir own purposes, but without copying. _Vide ante_, vol. ii. p. 528,\r\n_et seqq._\r\n\r\n[553] The great bath was torn up by the Marquis of Hastings with the\r\nintention of presenting it to George IV., an intention apparently never\r\ncarried out; but it is difficult to ascertain the facts now, as the\r\nwhole of the marble flooring with what remained of the bath was sold by\r\nauction by Lord William Bentinck, and fetched probably 1 per cent. of\r\nits original cost; but it helped to eke out the revenues of India in a\r\nmanner most congenial to the spirit of its governors.\r\n\r\n[554] Since the appointment of Sir John Strachey, the present\r\nenlightened Governor of the North West Provinces, I understand that\r\nthis state of affairs is entirely altered. Both care and money are\r\nnow expended liberally for the protection and maintenance of such old\r\nbuildings that remain in the province.\r\n\r\n[555] Perfect plans of this palace exist in the War Department of\r\nIndia. It is a great pity the Government cannot afford the very few\r\nrupees it would require to lithograph and publish them. Without such\r\nplans it is very difficult to make any description intelligible. That\r\nin Keene’s ‘Handbook of Agra,’ though useful as far as it goes, is\r\non too small a scale and not sufficiently detailed for purposes of\r\narchitectural illustration.\r\n\r\n[556] When we took possession of the palace every one seems to have\r\nlooted after the most independent fashion. Among others, a Captain\r\n(afterwards Sir John) Jones tore up a great part of this platform, but\r\nhad the happy idea to get his loot set in marble as table tops. Two of\r\nthese he brought home and sold to the Government for £500, and they\r\nare now in the India Museum. No one can doubt that the one with the\r\nbirds was executed by Florentine, or at least Italian artists; while\r\nthe other, which was apparently at the back of the platform, is a bad\r\ncopy from Raphael’s picture of Orpheus charming the beasts. As is well\r\nknown, that again was a copy of a picture in the Catacombs. There\r\nOrpheus is playing on a lyre, in Raphael’s picture on a violin, and\r\nthat is the instrument represented in the Delhi mosaic. Even if other\r\nevidence were wanting, this would be sufficient to set the question at\r\nrest. It certainly was not put there by the bigot Aurungzebe, nor by\r\nany of his successors.\r\n\r\n[557] It ought in fairness to be added that, since they have been in\r\nour possession, considerable sums have been expended on the repair of\r\nthese fragments.\r\n\r\n[558] The excuse for this deliberate act of Vandalism was, of course,\r\nthe military one, that it was necessary to place the garrison of Delhi\r\nin security in the event of any sudden emergency. Had it been correct\r\nit would have been a valid one, but this is not the case. Without\r\ntouching a single building of Shah Jehan’s there was ample space within\r\nthe walls for all the stores and matériel of the garrison of Delhi,\r\nand in the palace and Selim Ghur ample space for a garrison, more than\r\ndoubly ample to man their walls in the event of an émeute. There was\r\nample space for larger and better ventilated barracks just outside\r\nthe palace walls, where the Sepoy lines now are, for the rest of the\r\ngarrison, who could easily have gained the shelter of the palace walls\r\nin the event of any sudden rising of the citizens. It is, however,\r\nridiculous to fancy that the diminished and unarmed population of the\r\ncity could ever dream of such an attempt, while any foreign enemy with\r\nartillery strong enough to force the bastioned enceinte that surrounds\r\nthe town would in a very few hours knock the palace walls about the\r\nears of any garrison that might be caught in such a trap.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter appears to be this: the engineers perceived\r\nthat by gutting the palace they could provide at no trouble or expense\r\na wall round their barrack-yard, and one that no drunken soldier could\r\nscale without detection, and for this or some such wretched motive of\r\neconomy the palace was sacrificed!\r\n\r\nThe only modern act to be compared with this is the destruction of the\r\nsummer palace at Pekin. That, however, was an act of red-handed war,\r\nand may have been a political necessity. This was a deliberate act of\r\nunnecessary Vandalism--most discreditable to all concerned in it.\r\n\r\n[559] A plan of this garden, with the Taje and all the surrounding\r\nbuildings, will be found in the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’\r\nvol. vii. p. 42.\r\n\r\n[560] From its design I cannot help fancying that this screen was\r\nerected after Shah Jehan’s death. It certainly looks more modern.\r\n\r\n[561] There are eight photographs of it in Capt. Lyon’s collection, and\r\nmany also by others.\r\n\r\n[562] Page 478, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[563] If Lieut. Cole, instead of repeating plans and details of\r\nbuildings which had already been published by Gen. Cunningham, had\r\ngiven us a plan and details of this unknown building, he might have\r\nrendered a service all would have been grateful for.

Montgomerie,\r\nR.E.\r\n\r\n[564] ‘Embassy to Ava in 1795.’ London, 1800, 4to., 27 plates.\r\n\r\n[565] ‘Journal of Embassy to Court of Ava,’ 1827. 4to., plates.\r\n\r\n[566] ‘Mission to Court of Ava in 1855.’ 4to., numerous illustrations.\r\n\r\n[567] If any of our 1001 idle young men who do not know what to do with\r\nthemselves or their money would only qualify themselves for, and carry\r\nout such a mission, it is wonderful how easily and how pleasantly they\r\nmight add to our stores of knowledge. I am afraid it is not in the\r\nnature of the Anglo-Saxon to think of such a thing. Fox-hunting and\r\npheasant-shooting are more congenial pursuits.\r\n\r\n[568] ‘Mahawanso,’ p. 71.\r\n\r\n[569] R.

It is curious that there is a\r\ndiscrepancy between the native and the European authorities as to the\r\nnumber of storeys--not mechanical, of course, but symbolical; whether,\r\nin fact, the basement should be counted as a storey, or not. The above\r\nI believe to be the correct enumeration. We shall presently meet with\r\nthe same difficulty in describing Boro Buddor in Java.\r\n\r\n[583] ‘Mission to the Court of Ava,’ p. 169.\r\n\r\n[584] A view of this ruin will be found in Yule’s ‘Mission to Ava,’\r\nplate 23.\r\n\r\n[585] Yule’s ‘Mission to Ava,’ p. 163.\r\n\r\n[586] The Siamese invariably change the Indian _d_ into _th_.\r\n\r\n[587] For the particulars of this desiccation of the Valley of the\r\nGanges, see the ‘Journal of the Geological Society,’ April, 1863.\r\n\r\n[588] This form is interesting to us as it is that adopted for the\r\nAlbert Memorial in Hyde Park, the style of decoration of which is also\r\nmuch more like that employed in Siam than anything yet attempted out of\r\ndoors in Europe.\r\n\r\n[589] “As for the Indian kings none of them ever led an army out of\r\nIndia to attempt the conquest of any other country, lest they should be\r\ndeemed guilty of injustice.”--Arrian, ‘Indica,’ ch. ix.\r\n\r\n[590] ‘Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen.’ They\r\nhave done me the honour of electing me an honorary member of their\r\nSociety--an honour I feel all the more as it was quite unsolicited and\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n[591] There are twelve plates illustrating the same monument in Sir\r\nStamford Raffles’ ‘History of Java.’\r\n\r\n[592] Sir S.

Raffles’ ‘History of Java,’ vol. ii., 8vo. edition, p. 87,\r\n_et seqq._\r\n\r\n[599] I am perfectly aware that this is not borne out by the\r\ntranslation of this inscription given by Dr. Friederich in vol. xxvi.\r\nof the ‘Verhandelingen;’ but being dissatisfied with its unmeaningness,\r\nI took it to my friend, Professor Eggeling, who is perhaps a better\r\nSanscrit scholar than Friederich, and he fully confirms my view as\r\nabove expressed.\r\n\r\n[600] Yule’s ‘Marco Polo,’ vol. ii. p. 264, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[601] Beal’s translation, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[602] Raffles, vol. ii. p. 77, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[603] About half of the photographs of the Batavian Society are filled\r\nwith representations of these rude deities, which resemble more the\r\nimages of Easter Island than anything Indian.\r\n\r\n[604] Raffles, ‘History of Java,’ vol. ii. p. 93.\r\n\r\n[605] The compilers of the catalogue of the photographs of the Batavian\r\nSociety use 53 instead of 78 or 79 as the factor for converting Saka\r\ndates into those of the Christian Era. As, however, they give no reason\r\nfor this, and Brumund, Leemans and all the best modern authors use the\r\nIndian index, it is here adhered to throughout.\r\n\r\n[606] These latter dates are taken from Raffles and Crawfurd, but as\r\nthey are perfectly well ascertained, no reference seems needful.\r\n\r\n[607] ‘History of Java,’ vol. ii. p. 85.\r\n\r\n[608] ‘Dictionary of Indian Archipelago,’ p. 66.\r\n\r\n[609] ‘Boro Boudour,’ par Dr. C.

It was inadvertently packed among his\r\nbaggage when he went to Fiji.\r\n\r\n[610] _Ante_, p. 641. Also ‘Verhandelingen,’ &c., vol. xxvi. p. 31, _et\r\nseqq._ One of his inscriptions--the fourth--was found in Java proper.\r\n\r\n[611] All these, or nearly all, have been identified by Dr. Leemans in\r\nthe text that accompanies the plates.\r\n\r\n[612] If Brian Hodgson would attempt it, he perhaps alone could\r\nexplain all this vast and bewildering mythology. At present our means\r\nof identification is almost wholly confined to his representation in\r\nthe second volume of the ‘Transactions’ of the Royal Asiatic Society,\r\nplates 1-4, and to the very inferior work of Schlagintweit, ‘Buddhismus\r\nin Thibet.’\r\n\r\n[613] ‘Indische Alterthumskunde,’ vol. iv. p. 467.\r\n\r\n[614] General Cunningham’s drawings, though nearly sufficient for\r\nanyone as familiar with all the styles as I have become, are not enough\r\nfor anyone who is a stranger to the subject. I do not, indeed, know any\r\nEnglishman who has the knowledge, combined with the powers of drawing,\r\nto be entrusted with this task. A Frenchman might be found who could do\r\nit, if he would be content to restrain his imagination.\r\n\r\n[615] Col. Yule, from whose account most of these particulars are taken\r\n(‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ 1862), calls it “nearly\r\nnaked;” but a drawing by Wilsen (‘Verhandelingen,’ vol. xix. p. 166) I\r\nthink settles the question, that he is intended to be represented as\r\nclothed.\r\n\r\n[616] An imperfect representation of this sculpture will be found in\r\nthe ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. plate 53.\r\n\r\n[617] Sir S. Raffles’ ‘History of Java,’ vol. ii. plate 32.\r\n\r\n[618] The information here given is taken from Sir Stamford Raffles’\r\n‘History of Java,’ second edition, vol. ii. p. 17, _et seqq._ His\r\nplans, however, do not quite agree with the measurements in the\r\ntext, a mistake arising, I believe, from the scales in the original\r\ndrawings--now before me--being in Rheinland roods, which are not always\r\nconverted into English feet.\r\n\r\n[619] ‘History of Java,’ vol. ii. p. 85. Crawfurd makes it 1266 to\r\n1296; but no confidence can be placed on his dates for buildings.\r\n\r\n[620] ‘Boro Boeddoer,’ p. 433.\r\n\r\n[621] ‘Verhandelingen,’ &c., vol. xxxiii. p. 222.\r\n\r\n[622] ‘Boro Boeddoer,’ p. 439. ‘Verhandelingen,’ vol. xxxiii. p. 222.\r\n\r\n[623] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. xiii. p. 166.\r\n\r\n[624] ‘Boro Boeddoer,’ pp. 433-439.\r\n\r\n[625] This is by no means so certain; but till some one capable of\r\nobserving visits the place, we must assume it.\r\n\r\n[626] Not however, of the more modern class of temples, inasmuch as\r\nwhen John Crawfurd visited Ava in 1826, he describes (p. 162, 2nd ed.)\r\nhis visit to a temple just finished by the reigning monarch, which was\r\nadorned with a series of paintings on plaster representing scenes from\r\nthe life of Buddha. Each of these had a legend in the modern Burmese\r\ncharacter written over it; and it is curious to observe how nearly\r\nidentical the descriptions are with those which might be written over\r\nany Buddhist series. All the scenes there depicted are not perhaps to\r\nbe found at Bharhut or Sanchi, but all are at Amravati, and in the\r\nGandhara monasteries, or are to be found among the sculptures at Boro\r\nBuddor.\r\n\r\n[627] ‘Boro Boeddoer,’ p. 433.\r\n\r\n[628] Col.

Raffles and Crawfurd seem to be mistaken in ascribing\r\nthem to the Saivites; they seem to have been misled by the appearance\r\nof a Phallus, but there is no lingam.\r\n\r\n[632] In the first three volumes of the photographs published by the\r\nBatavian Society are numerous examples of rude sculptures, which are\r\nindistinguishable from those of Easter Island. Crawfurd and other\r\nethnologists do not seem to feel the least difficulty in extending\r\nthe Malay race from Easter Island to Madagascar; and if this is so,\r\nit diminishes the improbabilities of another nearly allied family,\r\nextending through the Pacific Islands from Java to the American\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n[633] ‘Travels in Indo-China, Cambodia, and Laos,’ by Henri Mouhot. 2\r\nvols. 8vo.

Had we exercised a tithe of the energy and\r\nintelligence in the investigation of Indian antiquities or history,\r\nduring the 100 years we have possessed the country, that the French\r\ndisplayed in Egypt during their short occupation of the valley of the\r\nNile, or now in Cambodia, which they do not possess at all, we should\r\nlong ago have known all that can be known regarding that country.\r\nSomething, it is true, has been done of late years to make up for past\r\nneglect. General Cunningham’s appointment to the post of Archæological\r\nSurveyor of India, and that of Mr. Burgess to a similar office in\r\nthe Bombay Presidency, are steps in the right direction, which, if\r\npersevered in, may lead to most satisfactory results. Many years must,\r\nhowever, elapse before the good work can be brought up to the position\r\nin which it ought to have been long ago, and meanwhile much that was\r\nmost important for the purpose has perished, and no record of it now\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n[637] The work is translated _in extenso_ in Abel Rémusat’s ‘Nouveaux\r\nMélanges Asiatiques,’ vol. i. p. 78, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[638] Bastian, _loc cit._, vol. i. p. 393.\r\n\r\n[639] Bastian, vol. i. p. 429.\r\n\r\n[640] Nakhon is only the Siamese pronunciation of the Indian Nagara,\r\nNuggur. Thom means “great.”\r\n\r\n[641] The French have navigated the lake in a large steamer, and\r\npublished detailed charts of the river. Maps are also found in Mouhot’s\r\n‘Travels;’ but the best are those which are found in the Atlas of\r\nLieut. Garnier’s work above referred to.\r\n\r\n[642] Bastian, vol. i. p. 402.\r\n\r\n[643] Mr. Thomson was informed that during the rains the whole was\r\nflooded, and the temple could be reached in boats.\r\n\r\n[644] Outside the temple the sides of the causeways are in places\r\nornamented with dwarf columns of circular form. They seem to simulate a\r\nbundle of eight reeds, and have tall capitals.\r\n\r\n[645] Garnier, loc. cit., vol. i. p. 120. Bastian, vol. i. pp. 400,\r\n415, 438, &c.\r\n\r\n[646] In the extracts from the ‘Chinese Annals,’ translated by Abel\r\nRémusat, in the first volume of the ‘Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques,’ he\r\nfinds the earliest mention of the Cambodian kingdom in A.D. 616. From\r\nthat period the accounts are tolerably consecutive to A.D. 1295, but\r\nbefore that nothing.\r\n\r\n[647] ‘Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques,’ vol. i. p. 103.\r\n\r\n[648] Bastian, vol. i. p. 404.\r\n\r\n[649] Garnier, ‘Voyage,’ &c., vol. i. p. 74.\r\n\r\n[650] ‘L’Art Khmer,’ p. 38.\r\n\r\n[651] It would be interesting if among these we could identify that one\r\nof which the Chinese traveller gives the following description:--“A\r\nl’est de la ville est un autre temple de l’esprit nommé _Pho-to-li_,\r\nauquel on sacrifie des hommes. Chaque année le roi va dans ce temple\r\nfaire lui-même un sacrifice humain pendant la nuit.”--‘Nouveaux\r\nMélanges Asiatiques,’ vol. i. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[652] At Buribun, on the other side of the lake, Dr. Bastian informs\r\nme there is a complete copy of the Nakhon Wat sculptures, carved in\r\nwood in the 16th century. The place was the residence of the kings of\r\nCambodia after the fall of the capital, and as original art had then\r\nperished, they took this mode of adorning their palace. What a prize\r\nfor any European museum!\r\n\r\n[653] ‘Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques,’ vol. i. p. 103. Garnier, woodcuts\r\npp. 61 and 62.\r\n\r\n[654] ‘Journal of the Royal Geographical Society,’ vol. xxxv. p. 75.\r\n\r\n[655] The population of China is generally estimated at 400 millions of\r\nsouls. This I believe to be a gross exaggeration, and would feel very\r\nmuch more inclined to put it at 300 millions, and of that number to\r\nestimate the Buddhists at 100 millions of souls. This, however, in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge, is, and must be, mere guess-work. If we\r\nput down 50 millions for the Buddhist population of Thibet, Manchuria,\r\nBurmah, Siam, Cambodia, and Ceylon, we shall probably not err on the\r\nside of underestimating them, making 150 millions the total number\r\nof followers of this religion in the whole world, or one-eighth or\r\none-tenth of the human race--not one-third or one-fourth, at which they\r\nare usually estimated.\r\n\r\n[656] The following description is abridged from that by Mr. A. Michie\r\nin his work entitled ‘The Siberian Overland Route,’ Murray, 1864. It\r\nis by far the most distinct I have met with. The larger woodcuts in\r\nthis chapter are generally borrowed from his work. It must, however, be\r\nobserved that his descriptions differ sometimes essentially from those\r\nhitherto current in European books, which were generally derived from\r\nthe accounts of the Jesuits, who probably obtained their information\r\nfrom Chinese sources. It is generally safer to trust to the account of\r\nan educated gentleman describing what he saw, than to the essay of a\r\nmere scholar compiling from information conveyed in a foreign tongue.\r\n\r\n[657] ‘Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques,’ vol. i. p. 110.\r\n\r\n[658] The tower was destroyed in the recent Taeping rebellion.\r\n\r\n[659] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. vii. p. 331 (N.S.),\r\nvol. v. p. 14, _et. seqq._\r\n\r\n[660] In the year 1870 I published in the ‘Journal of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society’ (N.S.), vol. iv. p. 81, _et seqq._, an article on\r\nIndian chronology, in which my views on the subject were stated at\r\ngreater length and more detail than it is proposed to do here. Being\r\naddressed to those who were supposed to be more or less familiar with\r\nthe subject, the paper took the form of an argument, rather than of a\r\nstatement, and is, consequently, difficult to follow by those to whom\r\nthe subject is new. The following is an abstract of that paper, with\r\nsuch corrections as have occurred to me in the meanwhile, and stated in\r\na consecutive form, and with only those details that seem necessary to\r\nrender it intelligible. For further particulars on special points the\r\nreader is referred to the article itself.\r\n\r\n[661] The lists used for this statement of pre-Buddhist chronology are\r\nthose compiled by James Prinsep, and published in his ‘Useful Tables’\r\nin 1836. They were afterwards revised and republished by Ed. Thomas,\r\nin his edition of Prinsep’s works, in 1858. In a regular treatise\r\non chronology it would be indispensable to refer to the Puranas\r\nthemselves; in a mere statement of results these tables are amply\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n[662] Crawfurd’s ‘Embassy to Ava,’ vol. ii. p. 274.\r\n\r\n[663] Bigandet’s ‘Life of Gaudama,’ p. 323.\r\n\r\n[664] ‘Embassy to Ava,’ loc. cit.\r\n\r\n[665] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 715.\r\n\r\n[666] Unfortunately the Chinese annals, to which we generally look for\r\nassistance in our difficulties, are not likely to afford us any in this.\r\nConfucius was born 551 B.C., and died 478; he was consequently only\r\neight years old when Buddha died, and in order to give Buddha the\r\nnecessary precedence in date, the Buddhists boldly added five centuries\r\nto this, placing him about 1000 B.C. This struggle between truth and\r\nfalsehood led to such confusion that in the 7th century Hiouen Thsang\r\nwrote: “Depuis le Nirvana jusqu’aujourd’hui les uns comptent 1200 ans,\r\nles autres 1500 ans: il y en a qui affirment qu’il s’est écoulé plus de\r\n900, mais que le nombre de 1000 n’est pas encore complet.” (‘Histoire,’\r\np. 131. ‘Vie et Voyages,’ i. 335.) The first is the nearest, according\r\nto our ideas. He was writing apparently in 1190 A.B. It may be 1200, if\r\nit was written after his return to China; but from this confusion it is\r\nevident no reliance can be placed on any dates he may quote from the\r\nNirvana.\r\n\r\n[667] ‘Embassy to Ava.’ Appendix.\r\n\r\n[668] Vishnu Purana, p. 463.\r\n\r\n[669] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv.

Throughout this work I\r\nhave used the latter figure as that more generally in use.\r\n\r\n[676] This list is abstracted principally from one in vol. viii. p. 27,\r\n‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ quoting only such\r\ndates as appear certain.

Some indeed of the most eminent among them place the\r\nGuptas considerably earlier. My conviction, however, is that they\r\nnever would have done so, had it not been that they place a mistaken\r\nconfidence on a passage in a foreign author of the 11th century,\r\ntranslated by Rémusat to the following effect: “Quant au Goupta Kala\r\n(ère des Gouptas), on entend par le mot Goupta des gens qui, dit-on,\r\nétaient méchants et puissants, et l’ère qui porte leur nom est l’époque\r\nde leur extermination. Apparemment Ballabha suivit immédiatement les\r\nGouptas, car l’ère des Gouptas commence aussi l’an 241 de l’ère de\r\nSaca.” (‘Journal Asiatique,’ 4me série, tom. iv. p. 286.)\r\n\r\nAlbiruni, from whom this passage is taken, lived at the court of Mahmúd\r\nof Ghazni, in the 11th century, and was learned beyond his compeers in\r\nthe learning of the Hindus. He collected facts and dates with industry,\r\nand recorded them faithfully. But he would have been a magician if he\r\ncould have unravelled the tangled meshes with which the Hindus had\r\npurposely obscured their chronology, and could have seen through all\r\nthe falsifications invented six centuries earlier. We could not do\r\nso now without the aid of coins, dated inscriptions, and buildings.\r\nNone of these were available in his day, and without their aid, the\r\nwonder is, not that he blundered in his inductions, but that he went\r\nso near the truth as he did. His facts and figures are valuable, and\r\nmay generally be relied upon. His mode of putting them together and his\r\ninductions are, as generally, worthless--not from any fault of his, but\r\nbecause they had been purposely falsified by those who presented them\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n[689] ‘Indian Antiquary,’ vol. ii. p. 312.\r\n\r\n[690] ‘Journal Asiatique,’ series iv. vol. iv. p. 285.\r\n\r\n[691] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vii. p. 634.\r\n\r\n[692] Thomas’s ‘Prinsep,’ i. p. 250.\r\n\r\n[693] This date is from an unpublished copper-plate grant, in the\r\npossession of Gen.

It seems, however, that the finances of India could\r\nnot bear the strain, for in August last a reply was received to the\r\neffect that “His Lordship regrets that he cannot consent to charge the\r\npublic revenues of India with the cost of such an undertaking.” As the\r\nIndian Council are responsible, and know best what should be done and\r\nwhat refused, there is no more to be said about the matter, though to\r\noutsiders this seems slightly inconsistent with their grant of £2000 to\r\nMax Müller for doing nothing that he had not been well paid for doing\r\nbeforehand. As no other means are available in this country, it is to\r\nbe hoped that either the French or German Governments will take it up.\r\nThey have always abundance of funds for such purposes; and had these\r\ninscriptions been collected by one of their countrymen, they would have\r\nbeen published without a year’s delay after having been brought home,\r\nalthough they have no interest in India that can for one moment be\r\ncompared with ours.\r\n\r\n[719] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv. p. 12.\r\n\r\n[720] ‘Report on Belgam and Kuladgi.’ p. 24.\r\n\r\n[721] ‘Mémoires des Contrées,’ &c., vol. ii. p. 150.\r\n\r\n[722] ‘Journal Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iii.\r\np. 206, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n[723] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 68.\r\n\r\n[724] ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ vol. iv. p. 9.\r\n\r\n[725] ‘Vie et Voyages,’ p. 188.\r\n\r\n[726] ‘Vie et Voyages,’ p. 215.\r\n\r\n[727] ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol. vi. p. 69.\r\n\r\n[728] ‘Vie et Voyages,’ p. 204.\r\n\r\n[729] ‘Relations,’ &c., vol. ii. p. 156.\r\n\r\n[730] Loc. cit., vol. ii. p. 42.\r\n\r\n[731] When I wrote last on the subject (‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety,’ vol. iv.
