Yet the word comic seems to\r\nme hardly to express all the parts of the subject which I have sought\r\nto bring together in my book. Moreover, the field of this history is\r\nvery large, and, though I have only taken as my theme one part of it,\r\nit was necessary to circumscribe even that, in some degree; and my\r\nplan, therefore, is to follow it chiefly through those branches which\r\nhave contributed most towards the formation of modern comic and satiric\r\nliterature and art in our own island.\r\n\r\nThus, as the comic literature of the middle ages to a very great\r\nextent, and comic art in a considerable degree also, were founded\r\nupon, or rather arose out of, those of the Romans which had preceded\r\nthem, it seemed desirable to give a comprehensive history of this\r\nbranch of literature and art as it was cultivated among the peoples of\r\nantiquity. Literature and art in the middle ages presented a certain\r\nunity of general character, arising, probably, from the uniformity of\r\nthe influence of the Roman element of society, modified only by its\r\nlower degree of intensity at a greater distance from the centre, and\r\nby secondary causes attendant upon it. To understand the literature\r\nof any one country in Western Europe, especially during what we may\r\nterm the feudal period--and the remark applies to art equally--it\r\nis necessary to make ourselves acquainted with the whole history of\r\nliterature in Western Europe during that time. The peculiarities in\r\ndifferent countries naturally became more marked in the progress of\r\nsociety, and more strongly individualised; but it was not till towards\r\nthe close of the feudal period that the literature of each of these\r\ndifferent countries was becoming more entirely its own. At that period\r\nthe plan I have formed restricts itself, according to the view stated\r\nabove. Thus, the satirical literature of the Reformation and pictorial\r\ncaricature had their cradle in Germany, and, in the earlier half of\r\nthe sixteenth century, carried their influence largely into France and\r\nEngland; but from that time any influence of German literature on these\r\ntwo countries ceases. Modern satirical literature has its models in\r\nFrance during the sixteenth century, and the direct influence of this\r\nliterature in France upon English literature continued during that and\r\nthe succeeding century, but no further. Political caricature rose to\r\nimportance in France in the sixteenth century, and was transplanted\r\nto Holland in the seventeenth century, and until the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century England owed its caricature, indirectly or directly,\r\nto the French and the Dutch; but after that time a purely English\r\nschool of caricature was formed, which was entirely independent of\r\nContinental caricaturists.\r\n\r\nThere are two senses in which the word history may be taken in regard\r\nto literature and art. It has been usually employed to signify a\r\nchronological account of authors or artists and their works, though\r\nthis comes more properly under the title of biography and bibliography.\r\nBut there is another and a very different application of the word, and\r\nthis is the meaning which I attach to it in the present volume. During\r\nthe middle ages, and for some period after (in special branches),\r\nliterature--I mean poetry, satire, and popular literature of all\r\nkinds--belonged to society, and not to the individual authors, who\r\nwere but workmen who gained a living by satisfying society's wants;\r\nand its changes in form or character depended all upon the varying\r\nprogress, and therefore changing necessities, of society itself. This\r\nis the reason why, especially in the earlier periods, nearly the whole\r\nmass of the popular--I may, perhaps, be allowed to call it the social\r\nliterature of the middle ages, is anonymous; and it was only at rare\r\nintervals that some individual rose and made himself a great name by\r\nthe superiority of his talents. A certain number of writers of fabliaux\r\nput their names to their compositions, probably because they were names\r\nof writers who had gained the reputation of telling better or racier\r\nstories than many of their fellows. In some branches of literature--as\r\nin the satirical literature of the sixteenth century--society still\r\nexercised this kind of influence over it; and although its great\r\nmonuments owe everything to the peculiar genius of their authors, they\r\nwere produced under the pressure of social circumstances. To trace all\r\nthese variations in literature connected with society, to describe the\r\ninfluences of society upon literature and of literature upon society,\r\nduring the progress of the latter, appears to me to be the true meaning\r\nof the word history, and it is in this sense that I take it.\r\n\r\nThis will explain why my history of the different branches of popular\r\nliterature and art ends at very different periods. The grotesque and\r\nsatirical sculpture, which adorned the ecclesiastical buildings,\r\nceased with the middle ages. The story-books, as a part of this social\r\nliterature, came down to the sixteenth century, and the history of\r\nthe jest-books which arose out of them cannot be considered to extend\r\nfurther than the beginning of the seventeenth; for, to give a list of\r\njest-books since that time would be to compile a catalogue of books\r\nmade by booksellers for sale, copied from one another, and, till\r\nrecently, each more contemptible than its predecessor. The school of\r\nsatirical literature in France, at all events as far as it had any\r\ninfluence in England, lasted no longer than the earlier part of the\r\nseventeenth century. England can hardly be said to have had a school of\r\nsatirical literature, with the exception of its comedy, which belongs\r\nproperly to the seventeenth century; and its caricature belongs\r\nespecially to the last century and to the earlier part of the present,\r\nbeyond which it is not a part of my plan to carry it.\r\n\r\nThese few remarks will perhaps serve to explain what some may consider\r\nto be defects in my book; and with them I venture to trust it to the\r\nindulgence of its readers. It is a subject which will have some novelty\r\nfor the English reader, for I am not aware that we have any previous\r\nbook devoted to it. At all events, it is not a mere compilation from\r\nother people's labours.\r\n\r\n                                             THOMAS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n  ORIGIN OF CARICATURE AND GROTESQUE--SPIRIT OF CARICATURE\r\n     IN EGYPT--MONSTERS: PYTHON AND GORGON--GREECE--THE\r\n     DIONYSIAC CEREMONIES, AND ORIGIN OF THE DRAMA--THE OLD\r\n     COMEDY--LOVE OF PARODY--PARODIES ON SUBJECTS TAKEN\r\n     FROM GRECIAN MYTHOLOGY: THE VISIT TO THE LOVER;

Laughter appears to be almost a\r\nnecessity of human nature, in all conditions of man's existence,\r\nhowever rude or however cultivated; and some of the greatest men of\r\nall ages, men of the most refined intellects, such as Cicero in the\r\nages of antiquity, and Erasmus among the moderns, have been celebrated\r\nfor their indulgence in it. The former was sometimes called by his\r\nopponents _scurra consularis_, the \"consular jester;\" and the latter,\r\nwho has been spoken of as the \"mocking-bird,\" is said to have laughed\r\nso immoderately over the well-known \"Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum,\"\r\nthat he brought upon himself a serious fit of illness. The greatest of\r\ncomic writers, Aristophanes, has always been looked upon as a model of\r\nliterary perfection. An epigram in the Greek Anthology, written by the\r\ndivine Plato, tells us how, when the Graces sought a temple which would\r\nnot fall, they found the soul of Aristophanes:--\r\n\r\n       Ἁι χάριτες τέμενός τι λαβεῖν ὁπερ οὐχὶ πεσεῖται\r\n            Ζητοῦσαι, ψυχὴν εὔρον Ἀριστοφάνους.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the men who never laughed, the ἀγέλαστοι, were\r\nlooked upon as the least respectable of mortals.\r\n\r\nA tendency to burlesque and caricature appears, indeed, to be a feeling\r\ndeeply implanted in human nature, and it is one of the earliest talents\r\ndisplayed by people in a rude state of society. An appreciation of, and\r\nsensitiveness to, ridicule, and a love of that which is humorous, are\r\nfound even among savages, and enter largely into their relations with\r\ntheir fellow men. When, before people cultivated either literature or\r\nart, the chieftain sat in his rude hall surrounded by his warriors,\r\nthey amused themselves by turning their enemies and opponents into\r\nmockery, by laughing at their weaknesses, joking on their defects,\r\nwhether physical or mental, and giving them nicknames in accordance\r\ntherewith,--in fact, caricaturing them in words, or by telling stories\r\nwhich were calculated to excite laughter. When the agricultural slaves\r\n(for the tillers of the land were then slaves) were indulged with a\r\nday of relief from their labours, they spent it in unrestrained mirth.\r\nAnd when these same people began to erect permanent buildings, and\r\nto ornament them, the favourite subjects of their ornamentation were\r\nsuch as presented ludicrous ideas. The warrior, too, who caricatured\r\nhis enemy in his speeches over the festive board, soon sought to give\r\na more permanent form to his ridicule, which he endeavoured to do by\r\nrude delineations on the bare rock, or on any other convenient surface\r\nwhich presented itself to his hand. Thus originated caricature and\r\nthe grotesque in art. In fact, art itself, in its earliest forms, is\r\ncaricature; for it is only by that exaggeration of features which\r\nbelongs to caricature, that unskilful draughtsmen could make themselves\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 1. An Egyptian Lady at a Feast._]\r\n\r\nAlthough we might, perhaps, find in different countries examples of\r\nthese principles in different states of development, we cannot in any\r\none country trace the entire course of the development itself: for in\r\nall the highly civilised races of mankind, we first become acquainted\r\nwith their history when they had already reached a considerable\r\ndegree of refinement; and even at that period of their progress, our\r\nknowledge is almost confined to their religious, and to their more\r\nseverely historical, monuments. Such is especially the case with\r\nEgypt, the history of which country, as represented by its monuments\r\nof art, carries us back to the remotest ages of antiquity. Egyptian\r\nart generally presents itself in a sombre and massive character, with\r\nlittle of gaiety or joviality in its designs or forms. Yet, as Sir\r\nGardner Wilkinson has remarked in his valuable work on the \"Manners\r\nand Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,\" the early Egyptian artists\r\ncannot always conceal their natural tendency to the humorous, which\r\ncreeps out in a variety of little incidents. Thus, in a series of grave\r\nhistorical pictures on one of the great monuments at Thebes, we find\r\na representation of a wine party, where the company consists of both\r\nsexes, and which evidently shows that the ladies were not restricted\r\nin the use of the juice of the grape in their entertainments; and,\r\nas he adds, \"the painters, in illustrating this fact, have sometimes\r\nsacrificed their gallantry to a love of caricature.\" Among the\r\nfemales, evidently of rank, represented in this scene, \"some call the\r\nservants to support them as they sit, others with difficulty prevent\r\nthemselves from falling on those behind them, and the faded flower,\r\nwhich is ready to drop from their heated hands, is intended to be\r\ncharacteristic of their own sensations.\" One group, a lady whose\r\nexcess has been carried too far, and her servant who comes to her\r\nassistance, is represented in our cut No. 1. Sir Gardner observes that\r\n\"many similar instances of a talent for caricature are observable in\r\nthe compositions of the Egyptian artists, who executed the paintings\r\nof the tombs\" at Thebes, which belong to a very early period of the\r\nEgyptian annals. Nor is the application of this talent restricted\r\nalways to secular subjects, but we see it at times intruding into the\r\nmost sacred mysteries of their religion. I give as a curious example,\r\ntaken from one of Sir Gardner Wilkinson's engravings, a scene in the\r\nrepresentation of a funeral procession crossing the Lake of the Dead\r\n(No. 2), that appears in one of these early paintings at Thebes, in\r\nwhich \"the love of caricature common to the Egyptians is shown to have\r\nbeen indulged even in this serious subject; and the retrograde movement\r\nof the large boat, which has grounded and is pushed off the bank,\r\nstriking the smaller one with its rudder, has overturned a large table\r\nloaded with cakes and other things, upon the rowers seated below, in\r\nspite of all the efforts of the prowman, and the earnest vociferations\r\nof the alarmed steersman.\" The accident which thus overthrows and\r\nscatters the provisions intended for the funeral feast, and the\r\nconfusion attendant upon it, form a ludicrous scene in the midst of a\r\nsolemn picture, that would be worthy of the imagination of a Rowlandson.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 2. Catastrophe in a Funeral Procession._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 3. An Unfortunate Soul._]\r\n\r\nAnother cut (No. 3), taken from one of the same series of paintings,\r\nbelongs to a class of caricatures which dates from a very remote\r\nperiod. One of the most natural ideas among all people would be to\r\ncompare men with the animals whose particular qualities they possessed.\r\nThus, one might be as bold as a lion, another as faithful as a dog,\r\nor as cunning as a fox, or as swinish as a hog. The name of the\r\nanimal would thus often be given as a nickname to the man, and in\r\nthe sequel he would be represented pictorially under the form of the\r\nanimal. It was partly out of this kind of caricature, no doubt, that\r\nthe singular class of apologues which have been since distinguished\r\nby the name of fables arose. Connected with it was the belief in\r\nthe metempsychosis, or transmission of the soul into the bodies of\r\nanimals after death, which formed a part of several of the primitive\r\nreligions. The earliest examples of this class of caricature of mankind\r\nare found on the Egyptian monuments, as in the instance just referred\r\nto, which represents \"a soul condemned to return to earth under the\r\nform of a pig, having been weighed in the scales before Osiris and\r\nbeen found wanting. Being placed in a boat, and accompanied by two\r\nmonkeys, it is dismissed the sacred precinct.\" The latter animals, it\r\nmay be remarked, as they are here represented, are the cynocephali, or\r\ndog-headed monkeys (the _simia inuus_), which were sacred animals among\r\nthe Egyptians, and the peculiar characteristic of which--the dog-shaped\r\nhead--is, as usual, exaggerated by the artist.\r\n\r\nThe representation of this return of a condemned soul under the\r\nrepulsive form of a pig, is painted on the left side wall of the long\r\nentrance-gallery to the tomb of King Rameses V., in the valley of\r\nroyal catacombs known as the Biban-el-Molook, at Thebes. Wilkinson\r\ngives the date of the accession of this monarch to the throne as 1185,\r\nB.C. In the original picture, Osiris is seated on his throne\r\nat some distance from the stern of the boat, and is dismissing it from\r\nhis presence by a wave of the hand. This tomb was open in the time of\r\nthe Romans, and termed by them the \"Tomb of Memnon;\" it was greatly\r\nadmired, and is covered with laudatory inscriptions by Greek and Roman\r\nvisitors. One of the most interesting is placed beneath this picture,\r\nrecording the name of a _daduchus_, or torch-bearer in the Eleusinian\r\nmysteries, who visited this tomb in the reign of Constantine.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 4. The Cat and the Geese._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 5. The Fox turned Piper._]\r\n\r\nThe practice having been once introduced of representing men under the\r\ncharacter of animals, was soon developed into other applications of the\r\nsame idea--such as that of figuring animals employed in the various\r\noccupations of mankind, and that of reversing the position of man and\r\nthe inferior animals, and representing the latter as treating their\r\nhuman tyrant in the same manner as they are usually treated by him.\r\nThe latter idea became a very favourite one at a later period, but\r\nthe other is met with not unfrequently among the works of art which\r\nhave been saved from the wrecks of antiquity. Among the treasures\r\nof the British Museum, there is a long Egyptian picture on papyrus,\r\noriginally forming a roll, consisting of representations of this\r\ndescription, from which I give three curious examples. The first (see\r\ncut No. 4) represents a cat in charge of a drove of geese. It will be\r\nobserved that the cat holds in her hand the same sort of rod, with a\r\nhook at the end, with which the monkeys are furnished in the preceding\r\npicture. The second (No. 5) represents a fox carrying a basket by means\r\nof a pole supported on his shoulder (a method of carrying burthens\r\nfrequently represented on the monuments of ancient art), and playing on\r\nthe well-known double flute, or pipe. The fox soon became a favourite\r\npersonage in this class of caricatures, and we know what a prominent\r\npart he afterwards played in mediæval satire. Perhaps, however, the\r\nmost popular of all animals in this class of drolleries was the monkey,\r\nwhich appears natural enough when we consider its singular aptitude\r\nto mimic the actions of man. The ancient naturalists tell us some\r\ncurious, though not very credible, stories of the manner in which this\r\ncharacteristic of the monkey tribes was taken advantage of to entrap\r\nthem, and Pliny (Hist. Nat. lib. viii. c. 80) quotes an older writer,\r\nwho asserted that they had even been taught to play at draughts. Our\r\nthird subject from the Egyptian papyrus of the British Museum (No. 6)\r\nrepresents a scene in which the game of draughts--or, more properly\r\nspeaking, the game which the Romans called the _ludus latrunculorum_,\r\nand which is believed to have resembled our draughts--is played by two\r\nanimals well known to modern heraldry, the lion and the unicorn. The\r\nlion has evidently gained the victory, and is fingering the money; and\r\nhis bold air of swaggering superiority, as well as the look of surprise\r\nand disappointment of his vanquished opponent, are by no means ill\r\npictured. This series of caricatures, though Egyptian, belongs to the\r\nRoman period.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 6. The Lion and the Unicorn._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 7. Typhon._]\r\n\r\nThe monstrous is closely allied to the grotesque, and both come within\r\nthe province of caricature, when we take this term in its widest\r\nsense. The Greeks, especially, were partial to representations of\r\nmonsters, and monstrous forms are continually met with among their\r\nornaments and works of art. The type of the Egyptian monster is\r\nrepresented in the accompanying cut (No. 7), taken from the work of\r\nSir Gardner Wilkinson before quoted, and is said to be the figure\r\nof the god Typhon. It occurs frequently on Egyptian monuments, with\r\nsome variation in its forms, but always characterised by the broad,\r\ncoarse, and frightful face, and by the large tongue lolling out. It is\r\ninteresting to us, because it is the apparent origin of a long series\r\nof faces, or masks, of this form and character, which are continually\r\nrecurring in the grotesque ornamentation, not only of the Greeks and\r\nRomans, but of the middle ages. It appears to have been sometimes given\r\nby the Romans to the representations of people whom they hated or\r\ndespised; and Pliny, in a curious passage of his \"Natural History,\"[1]\r\ninforms us that at one time, among the pictures exhibited in the Forum\r\nat Rome, there was one in which a Gaul was represented, \"thrusting\r\nout his tongue in a very unbecoming manner.\" The Egyptian Typhons had\r\ntheir exact representations in ancient Greece in a figure of frequent\r\noccurrence, to which antiquaries have, I know not why, given the name\r\nof Gorgon. The example in our cut No. 8, is a figure in terra-cotta,\r\nnow in the collection of the Royal Museum at Berlin.[2]\r\n\r\n [1] Plin. Hist. Nat., lib. xxxv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n [2] Panoska Terracotten des Museums Berlin, pl. lxi. p. 154.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 8. Gorgon._]\r\n\r\nIn Greece, however, the spirit of caricature and burlesque\r\nrepresentation had assumed a more regular form than in other\r\ncountries, for it was inherent in the spirit of Grecian society.\r\nAmong the population of Greece, the worship of Dionysus, or Bacchus,\r\nhad taken deep root from a very early period--earlier than we can\r\ntrace back--and it formed the nucleus of the popular religion and\r\nsuperstitions, the cradle of poetry and the drama. The most popular\r\ncelebrations of the people of Greece, were the Dionysiac festivals,\r\nand the phallic rites and processions which accompanied them, in\r\nwhich the chief actors assumed the disguise of satyrs and fawns,\r\ncovering themselves with goat-skins, and disfiguring their faces by\r\nrubbing them over with the lees of wine. Thus, in the guise of noisy\r\nbacchanals, they displayed an unrestrained licentiousness of gesture\r\nand language, uttering indecent jests and abusive speeches, in which\r\nthey spared nobody. This portion of the ceremony was the especial\r\nattribute of a part of the performers, who accompanied the procession\r\nin waggons, and acted something like dramatic performances, in which\r\nthey uttered an abundance of loose extempore satire on those who\r\npassed or who accompanied the procession, a little in the style of\r\nthe modern carnivals. It became thus the occasion for an unrestrained\r\npublication of coarse pasquinades. In the time of Pisistratus, these\r\nperformances are assumed to have been reduced to a little more order by\r\nan individual named Thespis, who is said to have invented masks as a\r\nbetter disguise than dirty faces, and is looked upon as the father of\r\nthe Grecian drama. There can be no doubt, indeed, that the drama arose\r\nout of these popular ceremonies, and it long bore the unmistakable\r\nmarks of its origin. Even the name of tragedy has nothing tragic in\r\nits derivation, for it is formed from the Greek word _tragos_\r\n(τράγος), a goat, in the skins of which animal the satyrs clothed\r\nthemselves, and hence the name was given also to those who personated\r\nthe satyrs in the processions. A _tragodus_ (τραγῳδὸς) was the singer,\r\nwhose words accompanied the movements of a chorus of satyrs, and the\r\nterm _tragodia_ was applied to his performance. In the same manner,\r\na _comodus_ (κωμωδὸς) was one who accompanied similarly, with chants\r\nof an abusive or satirical character, a _comus_ (κῶμος), or band of\r\nrevellers, in the more riotous and licentious portion of the\r\nperformances in the Bacchic festivals. The Greek drama always betrayed\r\nits origin by the circumstance that the performances took place\r\nannually, only at the yearly festivals in honour of Bacchus, of which\r\nin fact they constituted a part. Moreover, as the Greek drama became\r\nperfected, it still retained from its origin a triple division, into\r\ntragedy, comedy, and the satiric drama; and, being still performed\r\nat the Dionysiac festival in Athens, each dramatic author was expected\r\nto produce what was called a _trilogy_, that is, a tragedy, a satirical\r\nplay, and a comedy. So completely was all this identified in the\r\npopular mind with the worship of Bacchus, that, long afterwards, when\r\neven a tragedy did not please the audience by its subject, the common\r\nform of disapproval was, τί ταῦτα πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον--\"What has this\r\nto do with Bacchus?\" and, οὐδὲν πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον--\"This has nothing\r\nto do with Bacchus.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no perfect remains of the Greek satiric drama, which was,\r\nperhaps, of a temporary character, and less frequently preserved; but\r\nthe early Greek comedy is preserved in a certain number of the plays\r\nof Aristophanes, in which we can contemplate it in all its freedom of\r\ncharacter. It represented the waggon-jesting, of the age of Thespis, in\r\nits full development. In its form it was burlesque to a wanton degree\r\nof extravagance, and its essence was personal vilification, as well as\r\ngeneral satire. Individuals were not only attacked by the application\r\nto them of abusive epithets, but they were represented personally on\r\nthe stage as performing every kind of contemptible action, and as\r\nsuffering all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful treatment. The drama\r\nthus bore marks of its origin in its extraordinary licentiousness\r\nof language and costume, and in the constant use of the mask. One\r\nof its most favourite instruments of satire was parody, which was\r\nemployed unsparingly on everything which society in its solemn moments\r\nrespected--against everything that the satirist considered worthy of\r\nbeing held up to public derision or scorn. Religion itself, philosophy,\r\nsocial manners and institutions--even poetry--were all parodied in\r\ntheir turn. The comedies of Aristophanes are full of parodies on the\r\npoetry of the tragic and other writers of his age. He is especially\r\nhappy in parodying the poetry of the tragic dramatist Euripides. The\r\nold comedy of Greece has thus been correctly described as the comedy of\r\ncaricature; and the spirit, and even the scenes, of this comedy, being\r\ntransferred to pictorial representations, became entirely identical\r\nwith that branch of art to which we give the name of caricature in\r\nmodern times. Under the cover of bacchanalian buffoonery, a serious\r\npurpose, it is true, was aimed at; but the general satire was chiefly\r\nimplied in the violent personal attacks on individuals, and this became\r\nso offensive that when such persons obtained greater power in Athens\r\nthan the populace the old comedy was abolished.\r\n\r\nAristophanes was the greatest and most perfect poet of the Old Comedy,\r\nand his remaining comedies are as strongly marked representations of\r\nthe hostility of political and social parties in his time, as the\r\ncaricatures of Gillray are of party in the reign of our George III.,\r\nand, we may add, even more minute. They range through the memorable\r\nperiod of the Peloponnesian war, and the earlier ones give us the\r\nregular annual series of these performances, as far as Aristophanes\r\ncontributed them, during several years. The first of them, \"The\r\nAcharnians,\" was performed at the Lenæan feast of Bacchus in the sixth\r\nyear of the Peloponnesian war, the year 425 B.C., when it gained the\r\nfirst prize. It is a bold attack on the factious prolongation of the\r\nwar through the influence of the Athenian demagogues. The next, \"The\r\nKnights,\" brought out in B.C. 424, is a direct attack upon Cleon, the\r\nchief of these demagogues, although he is not mentioned by name; and\r\nit is recorded that, finding nobody who had courage enough to make a\r\nmask representing Cleon, or to play the character, Aristophanes was\r\nobliged to perform it himself, and that he smeared his face with lees\r\nof wine, in order to represent the flushed and bloated countenance of\r\nthe great demagogue, thus returning to the original mode of acting\r\nof the predecessors of Thespis. This, too, was the first of the\r\ncomedies of Aristophanes which he published in his own name. \"The\r\nClouds,\" published in 423, is aimed at Socrates and the philosophers.\r\nThe fourth, \"The Wasps,\" published in B.C. 422, presents a satire on\r\nthe litigious spirit of the Athenians. The fifth, entitled \"Peace\"\r\n(Ἔιρηνη), appeared in the year following, at the time of the peace of\r\nNicias, and is another satire on the bellicose spirit of the Athenian\r\ndemocracy. The next in the list of extant plays comes after an interval\r\nof several years, having been published in B.C. 414, the first year of\r\nthe Sicilian war, and relates to an irreligious movement in Athens,\r\nwhich had caused a great sensation. Two Athenians are represented as\r\nleaving Athens, in disgust at the vices and follies of their fellow\r\ncitizens, and seeking the kingdom of the birds, where they form a new\r\nstate, by which the communication between the mortals and the immortals\r\nis cut off, and is only opened again by an arrangement between all\r\nthe parties. In the \"Lysistrata,\" believed to have been brought out\r\nin 411, when the war was still at its height, the women of Athens are\r\nrepresented as engaging in a cunning and successful plot, by which\r\nthey gain possession of the government of the state, and compel their\r\nhusbands to make peace. \"The Thesmophoriazusæ,\" appears to have been\r\npublished in B.C. 410; it is a satire upon Euripides, whose writings\r\nwere remarkable for their bitter attacks on the character of the\r\nfemale sex, who, in this comedy, conspire against him to secure his\r\npunishment. The comedy of \"The Frogs\" was brought out in the year\r\n405 B.C., and is a satire on the literature of the day; it\r\nis aimed especially at Euripides, and was perhaps written soon after\r\nhis death, its real subject being the decline of the tragic drama,\r\nwhich Euripides was accused of having promoted. It is perhaps the most\r\nwitty of the plays of Aristophanes which have been preserved. \"The\r\nEcclesiazusæ,\" published in 392, is a burlesque upon the theories of\r\nrepublican government, which were then started among the philosophers,\r\nsome of which differed little from our modern communism. The ladies\r\nagain, by a clever conspiracy, gain the mastery in the estate, and they\r\ndecree a community of goods and women, with some laws very peculiar\r\nto that state of things. The humour of the piece, which is extremely\r\nbroad, turns upon the disputes and embarrassments resulting from this\r\nstate of things. The last of his comedies extant, \"Plutus,\" appears to\r\nbe a work of the concluding years of the active life of Aristophanes;\r\nit is the least striking of them all, and is rather a moral than a\r\npolitical satire.\r\n\r\nIn a comedy brought out in 426, the year before \"The Archarnians,\"\r\nunder the title of \"The Babylonians,\" Aristophanes appears to have\r\ngiven great offence to the democratic party, a circumstance to which\r\nhe alludes more than once in the former play. However, his talents and\r\npopularity seem to have carried him over the danger, and certainly\r\nnothing can have exceeded the bitterness of satire employed in his\r\nsubsequent comedies. Those who followed him were less fortunate.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest writers of the Old Comedy was Anaximandrides,\r\nwho cast a reflection on the state of Athens in parodying a line of\r\nEuripides. This poet had said,--\r\n\r\n                ἡ φύσις ἐβούλεθ’ ἦ νόμων οὐδεν μέλει\r\n       (Nature has commanded, which cares nothing for the laws);\r\n\r\nwhich Anaximandrides changed to--\r\n\r\n                ἡ πόλις ἐβούλεθ’ ἦ νόμων οὐδεν μέλει\r\n      (The state has commanded, which cares nothing for the laws).\r\n\r\nNowhere is oppression exercised with greater harshness than under\r\ndemocratic governments; and Anaximandrides was prosecuted for this\r\njoke as a crime against the state, and condemned to death. As may be\r\nsupposed, liberty of speech ceased to exist in Athens. We are well\r\nacquainted with the character of the Old Comedy, in its greatest\r\nfreedom, through the writings of Aristophanes. What was called the\r\nMiddle Comedy, in which political satire was prohibited, lasted from\r\nthis time until the age of Philip of Macedon, when the old liberty of\r\nGreece was finally crushed. The last form of Greek comedy followed,\r\nwhich is known as the New Comedy, and was represented by such names as\r\nEpicharmus and Menander. In the New Comedy all caricature and parody,\r\nand all personal allusions, were entirely proscribed; it was changed\r\nentirely into a comedy of manners and domestic life, a picture of\r\ncontemporary society under conventional names and characters. From this\r\nNew Comedy was taken the Roman comedy, such as we now have it in the\r\nplays of Plautus and Terence, who were professed imitators of Menander\r\nand the other writers of the new comedy of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 9. A Greek Parody._]\r\n\r\nPictorial caricature was, of course, rarely to be seen on the public\r\nmonuments of Greece or Rome, but must have been consigned to objects\r\nof a more popular character and to articles of common use; and,\r\naccordingly, modern antiquarian research has brought it to light\r\nsomewhat abundantly on the pottery of Greece and Etruria, and on the\r\nwall-paintings of domestic buildings in Herculaneum and Pompeii. The\r\nformer contains comic scenes, especially parodies, which are evidently\r\ntransferred to them from the stage, and which preserve the marks and\r\nother attributes--some of which I have necessarily omitted--proving the\r\nmodel from which they were taken. The Greeks, as we know from many\r\nsources, were extremely fond of parodies of every description, whether\r\nliterary or pictorial. The subject of our cut No. 9 is a good example\r\nof the parodies found on the Greek pottery; it is taken from a fine\r\nEtruscan vase,[3] and has been supposed to be a parody on the visit of\r\nJupiter to Alcmena. This appears rather doubtful, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that it is a burlesque representation of the visit of a lover\r\nto the object of his aspirations. The lover, in the comic mask and\r\ncostume, mounts by a ladder to the window at which the lady presents\r\nherself, who, it must be confessed, presents the appearance of giving\r\nher admirer a very cold reception. He tries to conciliate her by a\r\npresent of what seem to be apples, instead of gold, but without much\r\neffect. He is attended by his servant with a torch, to give him light\r\non the way, which shows that it is a night adventure. Both master and\r\nservant have wreaths round their heads, and the latter carries a third\r\nin his hand, which, with the contents of his basket, are also probably\r\nintended as presents to the lady.\r\n\r\n [3] Given in Panofka, \"Antiques du Cabinet Pourtalès,\" pl. x.\r\n\r\nA more unmistakable burlesque on the visit of Jupiter to Alcmena is\r\npublished by Winckelmann from a vase, formerly in the library of the\r\nVatican, and now at St. Petersburg. The treatment of the subject is\r\nnot unlike the picture just described. Alcmena appears just in the\r\nsame posture at her chamber window, and Jupiter is carrying his ladder\r\nto mount up to her, but has not yet placed it against the wall. His\r\ncompanion is identified with Mercury by the well-known caduceus he\r\ncarries in his left hand, while with his right hand he holds a lamp\r\nup to the window, in order to enable Jupiter to see the object of his\r\namour.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing with how much boldness the Greeks parodied and\r\nridiculed sacred subjects. The Christian father, Arnobius, in writing\r\nagainst his heathen opponents, reproached them with this circumstance.\r\nThe laws, he says, were made to protect the characters of men from\r\nslander and libel, but there was no such protection for the characters\r\nof the gods, which were treated with the greatest disrespect.[4] This\r\nwas especially the case in their pictorial representations.\r\n\r\n [4] Arnobius (_contra Gentes_), lib. iv. p. 150. Carmen malum\r\n     conscribere, quo fama alterius coinquinatur et vita, decemviralibus\r\n     scitis evadere noluistis impune: ac ne vestras aures convitio\r\n     aliquis petulantiore pulsaret, de atrocibus formulas constituistis\r\n     injuriis. Soli dii sunt apud vos superi inhonorati, contemtibiles,\r\n     viles: in quos jus est vobis datum quæ quisque voluerit dicere\r\n     turpitudinem, jacere quas libido confinxerit atque excogitaverit\r\n     formas.\r\n\r\nPliny informs us that Ctesilochus, a pupil of the celebrated Apelles,\r\npainted a burlesque picture of Jupiter giving birth to Bacchus, in\r\nwhich the god was represented in a very ridiculous posture.[5] Ancient\r\nwriters intimate that similar examples were not uncommon, and mention\r\nthe names of several comic painters, whose works of this class were\r\nin repute. Some of these were bitter personal caricatures, like a\r\ncelebrated work of a painter named Ctesicles, described also by Pliny.\r\nIt appears that Stratonice, the queen of Seleucus Nicator, had received\r\nthis painter ill when he visited her court, and in revenge he executed\r\na picture in which she was represented, according to a current scandal,\r\nas engaged in an amour with a common fisherman, which he exhibited in\r\nthe harbour of Ephesus, and then made his escape on ship-board. Pliny\r\nadds that the queen admired the beauty and accuracy of the painting\r\nmore than she felt the insult, and that she forbade the removal of the\r\npicture.[6]\r\n\r\n [5] Pliny, Hist. Nat., lib. xxxv. c. 40.\r\n\r\n [6] Pliny, Hist. Nat., lib. xxxv. c. 40.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 10. Apollo at Delphi._]\r\n\r\nThe subject of our second example of the Greek caricature is better\r\nknown. It is taken from an oxybaphon which was brought from the\r\nContinent to England, where it passed into the collection of Mr.\r\nWilliam Hope.[7] The _oxybaphon_ (ὀξύβαφον), or, as it was called\r\nby the Romans, _acetabulum_, was a large vessel for holding vinegar,\r\nwhich formed one of the important ornaments of the table, and was\r\ntherefore very susceptible of pictorial embellishment of this\r\ndescription. It is one of the most remarkable Greek caricatures\r\nof this kind yet known, and represents a parody on one of the most\r\ninteresting stories of the Grecian mythology, that of the arrival of\r\nApollo at Delphi. The artist, in his love of burlesque, has spared\r\nnone of the personages who belonged to the story. The Hyperborean\r\nApollo himself appears in the character of a quack doctor, on his\r\ntemporary stage, covered by a sort of roof, and approached by wooden\r\nsteps. On the stage lies Apollo's luggage, consisting of a bag, a\r\nbow, and his Scythian cap. Chiron (ΧΙΡΩΝ) is represented as labouring\r\nunder the effects of age and blindness, and supporting himself by the\r\naid of a crooked staff, as he repairs to the Delphian quack-doctor for\r\nrelief. The figure of the centaur is made to ascend by the aid of a\r\ncompanion, both being furnished with the masks and other attributes of\r\nthe comic performers. Above are the mountains, and on them the nymphs\r\nof Parnassus (ΝΥΜΦΑΙ), who, like all the other actors in the scene, are\r\ndisguised with masks, and those of a very grotesque character. On the\r\nright-hand side stands a figure which is considered as representing the\r\n_epoptes_, the inspector or overseer of the performance, who alone wears\r\nno mask. Even a pun is employed to heighten the drollery of the scene,\r\nfor instead of ΠΥΘΙΑΣ, the Pythian, placed over the head of the\r\nburlesque Apollo, it seems evident that the artist had written ΠΕΙΘΙΑΣ,\r\nthe consoler, in allusion, perhaps, to the consolation which the\r\nquack-doctor is administering to his blind and aged visitor.\r\n\r\n [7] Engraved by Ch. Lenormant et J. de Witt, \"Elite des Monuments\r\n     Céramographiques,\" pl. xciv.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 11. The Flight of Æneas from Troy._]\r\n\r\nThe Greek spirit of parody, applied even to the most sacred subjects,\r\nhowever it may have declined in Greece, was revived at Rome, and we\r\nfind examples of it on the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum. They\r\nshow the same readiness to turn into burlesque the most sacred and\r\npopular legends of the Roman mythology. The example given (cut No. 11),\r\nfrom one of the wall-paintings, is peculiarly interesting, both from\r\ncircumstances in the drawing itself, and because it is a parody on\r\none of the favourite national legends of the Roman people, who prided\r\nthemselves on their descent from Æneas. Virgil has told, with great\r\neffect, the story of his hero's escape from the destruction of Troy--or\r\nrather has put the story into his hero's mouth. When the devoted\r\ncity was already in flames, Æneas took his father, Anchises, on his\r\nshoulder, and his boy, Iulus, or, as he was otherwise called, Ascanius,\r\nby the hand, and thus fled from his home, followed by his wife--\r\n\r\n    _Ergo age, care pater, cervici imponere nostræ;\r\n    Ipse subibo humeris, nec me labor iste gravabit.\r\n    Quo res cumque cadent, unum et commune periclum,\r\n    Una salus ambobus erit. Mihi parvus Iulus\r\n    Sit comes, et longe servat vestigia conjux._\r\n                                          --Virg. Æn., lib. ii. l. 707.\r\n\r\nThus they hurried on, the child holding by his father's right hand, and\r\ndragging after with \"unequal steps,\"--\r\n\r\n                                _dextræ se parvus Iulus\r\n    Implicuit sequiturque patrem non passibus æquis._\r\n                                          --Virg. Æn., lib. ii. 1. 723.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Æneas bore away both father and son, and the penates, or\r\nhousehold gods, of his family, which were to be transferred to another\r\ncountry, and become the future guardians of Rome--\r\n\r\n    _Ascanium, Anchisemque patrem, Tencrosque penates._--Ib., 1. 747.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 12. The Flight of Æneas._]\r\n\r\nIn this case we know that the design is intended to be a parody, or\r\nburlesque, upon a picture which appears to have been celebrated at the\r\ntime, and of which at least two different copies are found upon ancient\r\nintaglios. It is the only case I know in which both the original and\r\nthe parody have been preserved from this remote period, and this is so\r\ncurious a circumstance, that I give in the cut on the preceding page\r\na copy of one of the intaglios.[8] It represented literally Virgil's\r\naccount of the story, and the only difference between the design on the\r\nintaglios and the one given in our first cut is, that in the latter\r\nthe personages are represented under the forms of monkeys. Æneas,\r\npersonified by the strong and vigorous animal, carrying the old monkey,\r\nAnchises, on his left shoulder, hurries forward, and at the same time\r\nlooks back on the burning city. With his right hand he drags along\r\nthe boy Iulus, or Ascanius, who is evidently proceeding _non passibus\r\næquis_, and with difficulty keeps up with his father's pace. The boy\r\nwears a Phrygian bonnet, and holds in his right hand the instrument\r\nof play which we should now call a \"bandy\"--the pedun. Anchises has\r\ncharge of the box, which contains the sacred penates. It is a curious\r\ncircumstance that the monkeys in this picture are the same dog-headed\r\nanimals, or cynocephali, which are found on the Egyptian monuments.\r\n\r\n [8] These intaglios are engraved in the Museum Florentinum of Gorius,\r\n     vol. ii. pl. 30.

In Italy, as in Greece, the first\r\ngerms of comic literature may be traced in the religious festivals,\r\nwhich presented a mixture of religious worship and riotous festivity,\r\nwhere the feasters danced and sung, and, as they became excited with\r\nwine and enthusiasm, indulged in mutual reproaches and abuse. The\r\noldest poetry of the Romans, which was composed in irregular measure,\r\nwas represented by the _versus saturnini_, said to have been so called\r\nfrom their antiquity (for things of remote antiquity were believed to\r\nbelong to the age of Saturn). Nævius, one of the oldest of Latin poets,\r\nis said to have written in this verse. Next in order of time came the\r\nFescennine verses, which appear to have been distinguished chiefly\r\nby their license, and received their name because they were brought\r\nfrom Fescennia, in Etruria, where they were employed originally in the\r\nfestivals of Ceres and Bacchus. In the year 391 of Rome, or 361 B.C.,\r\nthe city was visited by a dreadful plague, and the citizens hit upon\r\nwhat will appear to us the rather strange expedient of sending for\r\nperformers (_ludiones_) from Etruria, hoping, by employing them, to\r\nappease the anger of the gods. Any performer of this kind appears to\r\nhave been so little known to the Romans before this, that there was\r\nnot even a name for him in the language, and they were obliged to adopt\r\nthe Tuscan word, and call him a _histrio_, because _hister_ in that\r\nlanguage meant a player or pantomimist. This word, we know, remained\r\nin the Latin language. These first Etrurian performers appear indeed\r\nto have been mere pantomimists, who accompanied the flute with all\r\nsorts of mountebank tricks, gestures, dances, gesticulations, and the\r\nlike, mixed with satirical songs, and sometimes with the performance of\r\ncoarse farces. The Romans had also a class of performances rather more\r\ndramatic in character, consisting of stories which were named _Fabulæ\r\nAtellanæ_, because these performers were brought from Atella, a city of\r\nthe Osci.\r\n\r\nA considerable advance was made in dramatic Art in Rome about the\r\nmiddle of the third century before Christ. It is ascribed to a freedman\r\nnamed Livius Andronicus, a Greek by birth, who is said to have brought\r\nout, in the year 240 B.C., the first regular comedy ever performed in\r\nRome. Thus we trace not only the Roman comedy, but the very rudiments\r\nof dramatic art in Rome, either direct to the Greeks, or to the Grecian\r\ncolonies in Italy. With the Romans, as well as with the Greeks, the\r\ntheatre was a popular institution, open to the public, and the state\r\nor a wealthy individual paid for the performance; and therefore the\r\nbuilding itself was necessarily of very great extent, and, in both\r\ncountries open to the sky, except that the Romans provided for throwing\r\nan awning over it. As the Roman comedy was copied from the new comedy\r\nof the Greeks, and therefore did not admit of the introduction of\r\ncaricature and burlesque on the stage, these were left especially to\r\nthe province of the pantomime and farce, which the Romans, as just\r\nstated, had received from a still earlier period.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 13. A Scene from Terence._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 14. Geta and Demea._]\r\n\r\nWhether the Romans borrowed the mask from the Greeks, or not, is\r\nrather uncertain, but it was used as generally in the Roman theatres,\r\nwhether in comedy or tragedy, as among the Greeks. The Greek actors\r\nperformed upon stilts, in order to magnify their figures, as the area\r\nof the theatre was very large and uncovered, and without this help\r\nthey were not so well seen at a distance; and one object of utility\r\naimed at by the mask is said to have been to make the head appear\r\nproportionate in size to the artificial height of the body. It may\r\nbe remarked that the mask seems generally to have been made to cover\r\nthe whole head, representing the hair as well as the face, so that\r\nthe character of age or complexion might be given complete. Among the\r\nRomans the stilts were certainly not in general use, but still the\r\nmask, besides its comic or tragic character, is supposed to have served\r\nuseful purposes. The first improvement upon its original structure\r\nis said to have been the making it of brass, or some other sonorous\r\nmetal, or at least lining the mouth with it, so as to reverberate, and\r\ngive force to the voice, and also to the mouth of the mask something\r\nof the character of a speaking-trumpet.[9] All these accessories could\r\nnot fail to detract much from the effect of the acting, which must in\r\ngeneral have been very measured and formal, and have received most of\r\nits importance from the excellence of the poetry, and the declamatory\r\ntalents of the actors. We have pictures in which scenes from the Roman\r\nstage are accurately represented. Several rather early manuscripts of\r\nTerence have been preserved, illustrated with drawings of the scenes\r\nas represented on the stage, and these, though belonging to a period\r\nlong subsequent to the age in which the Roman stage existed in its\r\noriginal character, are, no doubt, copied from drawings of an earlier\r\ndate. A German antiquary of the last century, Henry Berger, published\r\nin a quarto volume a series of such illustrations from a manuscript of\r\nTerence in the library of the Vatican at Rome, from which two examples\r\nare selected, as showing the usual style of Roman comic acting, and\r\nthe use of the mask. The first (No. 13) is the opening scene in the\r\n_Andria_. On the right, two servants have brought provisions, and on\r\nthe left appear Simo, the master of the household, and his freedman,\r\nSosia, who seems to be entrusted with the charge of his domestic\r\naffairs. Simo tells his servants to go away with the provisions, while\r\nhe beckons Sosia to confer with him in private:--\r\n\r\n      Si. _Vos istæc intro auferte; abite. Sosia,\r\n      Adesdum; paucis te volo._ So. _Dictum puta\r\n      Nempe ut curentur recte hæc._ Si. _Imo aliud_.\r\n                                       Terent. Andr., Actus i., Scena 1.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare these words with the picture, we cannot but feel\r\nthat in the latter there is an unnecessary degree of energy put into\r\nthe _pose_ of the figures; which is perhaps less the case in the\r\nother (No. 14), an illustration of the sixth scene of the fifth act\r\nof the _Adelphi_ of Terence. It represents the meeting of Geta, a\r\nrather talkative and conceited servant, and Demea, a countryfied and\r\nchurlish old man, his acquaintance, and of course superior. To Geta's\r\nsalutation, Demea asks churlishly, as not at first knowing him, \"Who\r\nare you?\" but when he finds that it is Geta, he changes suddenly to an\r\nalmost fawning tone:--\r\n\r\n        G. ... _Sed eccum Demeam. Salvus fies._\r\n        D. _Oh, qui vocare?_ G. _Geta._ D. _Geta, hominem maximi\r\n      Pretii esse te hodie judicavi animo mei._\r\n\r\n [9] It is said to have received its Latin name from this circumstance,\r\n     _persona, a personando_. See Aulus Gellius, Noct. Att., lib. v.\r\n     c. 7.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 15. Comic Scene from Pompeii._]\r\n\r\nThat these representations are truthful, the scenes in the\r\nwall-paintings of Pompeii leave us no room to doubt. One of these is\r\nproduced in our cut No. 15, which is no doubt taken from a comedy\r\nnow lost, and we are ignorant whom the characters are intended to\r\nrepresent. The _pose_ given to the two comic figures, compared with\r\nthe example given from Berger, would lead us to suppose that this\r\nover-energetic action was considered as part of the character of comic\r\nacting.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 16. Cupids at Play._]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Roman masks is the more interesting, because they\r\nwere probably the origin of many of the grotesque faces so often met\r\nwith in mediæval sculpture. The comic mask was, indeed, a very popular\r\nobject among the Romans, and appears to have been taken as symbolical\r\nof everything that was droll and burlesque. From the comic scenes of\r\nthe theatre, to which it was first appropriated, it passed to the\r\npopular festivals of a public character, such as the Lupercalia, with\r\nwhich, no doubt, it was carried into the carnival of the middle ages,\r\nand to our masquerades. Among the Romans, also, the use of the mask\r\nsoon passed from the public festivals to private supper parties. Its\r\nuse was so common that it became a plaything among children, and was\r\nsometimes used as a bugbear to frighten them. Our cut No. 16, taken\r\nfrom a painting at Resina, represents two cupids playing with a mask,\r\nand using it for this latter purpose, that is, to frighten one another;\r\nand it is curious that the mediæval gloss of Ugutio explains _larva_,\r\na mask, as being an image, \"which was put over the face to frighten\r\nchildren.\"[10] The mask thus became a favourite ornament, especially on\r\nlamps, and on the antefixa and gargoyls of Roman buildings, to which\r\nwere often given the form of grotesque masks, monstrous faces, with\r\ngreat mouths wide open, and other figures, like those of the gargoyls\r\nof the mediæval architects.\r\n\r\n [10] \"Simulacrum ... quod opponitur faciei ad terrendos parvos.\"\r\n      (Ugutio, ap. Ducange, v. _Masca_.)\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 17. The Roman Sannio, or Buffoon._]\r\n\r\nWhile the comic mask was used generally in the burlesque\r\nentertainments, it also became distinctive of particular characters.\r\nOne of these was the _sannio_, or buffoon, whose name was derived from\r\nthe Greek word σάννος, \"a fool,\" and who was employed in performing\r\nburlesque dances, making grimaces, and in other acts calculated to\r\nexcite the mirth of the spectator. A representation of the _sannio_\r\nis given in our cut No. 17, copied from one of the engravings in the\r\n\"Dissertatio de Larvis Scenicis,\" by the Italian antiquary Ficoroni,\r\nwho took it from an engraved gem. The sannio holds in his hand what is\r\nsupposed to be a brass rod, and he has probably another in the other\r\nhand, so that he could strike them together. He wears the _soccus_, or\r\nlow shoe peculiar to the comic actors. This buffoon was a favourite\r\ncharacter among the Romans, who introduced him constantly into their\r\nfeasts and supper parties. The _manducus_ was another character of this\r\ndescription, represented with a grotesque mask, presenting a wide mouth\r\nand tongue lolling out, and said to have been peculiar to the Atellane\r\nplays. A character in Plautus (Rud., ii. 6, 51) talks of hiring himself\r\nas a _manducus_ in the plays.\r\n\r\n           \"_Quid si aliquo ad ludos me pro manduco locem?_\"\r\n\r\nThe mediæval glosses interpret _manducus_ by _joculator_, \"a jogelor,\"\r\nand add that the characteristic from which he took his name was the\r\npractice of making grimaces like a man gobbling up his food in a vulgar\r\nand gluttonous manner.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 18. Roman Tom Fool._]\r\n\r\nFicoroni gives, from an engraved onyx, a figure of another burlesque\r\nperformer, copied in our cut No. 18, and which he compares to the\r\nCatanian dancer of his time (his book was published in 1754), who was\r\ncalled a _giangurgolo_. This is considered to represent the Roman\r\n_mimus_, a class of performers who told with mimicry and action scenes\r\ntaken from common life, and more especially scandalous and indecent\r\nanecdotes, like the jogelors and performers of farces in the middle\r\nages. The Romans were very much attached to these performances, so much\r\nso, that they even had them at their funeral processions and at their\r\nfuneral feasts. In our figure, the _mimus_ is represented naked, masked\r\n(with an exaggerated nose), and wearing what is perhaps intended as a\r\ncaricature of the Phrygian bonnet. In his right hand he holds a bag,\r\nor purse, full of objects which rattle and make a noise when shaken,\r\nwhile the other holds the _crotalum_, or castanets, an instrument in\r\ncommon use among the ancients. One of the statues in the Barberini\r\nPalace represents a youth in a Phrygian cap playing on the _crotalum_.\r\nWe learn, from an early authority, that it was an instrument especially\r\nused in the satirical and burlesque dances which were so popular among\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\nAs I have remarked before, the Romans had no taste for the regular\r\ndrama, but they retained to the last their love for the performances\r\nof the popular _mimi_, or _comædi_ (as they were often called), the\r\nplayers of farces, and the dancers. These performed on the stage, in\r\nthe public festivals, in the streets, and were usually introduced at\r\nprivate parties.[11] Suetonius tells us that on one occasion, the\r\nemperor Caligula ordered a poet who composed the Atellanes (_Attellanæ\r\npoetam_) to be burnt in the middle of the amphitheatre, for a pun. A\r\nmore regular comedy, however, did flourish, to a certain degree, at\r\nthe same time with these more popular compositions. Of the works of\r\nthe earliest of the Roman comic writers, Livius Andronicus and Nævius,\r\nwe know only one or two titles, and a few fragments quoted in the\r\nworks of the later Roman writers. They were followed by Plautus, who\r\ndied B.C. 184, and nineteen of whose comedies are preserved and well\r\nknown; by several other writers, whose names are almost forgotten, and\r\nwhose comedies are all lost; and by Terence, six of whose comedies are\r\npreserved. Terence died about the year 159 B.C. About the same time\r\nwith Terence lived Lucius Afranius and Quinctius Atta, who appear to\r\nclose the list of the Roman writers of comedy.\r\n\r\n [11] See, for allusions to the private employment of these\r\n      performances, Pliny, Epist. i. 15, and ix. 36.\r\n\r\nBut another branch of comic literature had sprung out of the satire of\r\nthe religious festivities. A year after Livius Andronicus produced the\r\nfirst drama at Rome, in the year 239 B.C., the poet Ennius was born\r\nat Rudiæ, in Magna Græcia. The satirical verse, whether Saturnine or\r\nFescennine, had been gradually improving in its form, although still\r\nvery rude, but Ennius is said to have given at least a new polish, and\r\nperhaps a new metrical shape, to it. The verse was still irregular, but\r\nit appears to have been no longer intended for recitation, accompanied\r\nby the flute. The Romans looked upon Ennius not only as their earliest\r\nepic poet, but as the father of satire, a class of literary composition\r\nwhich appears to have originated with them, and which they claimed\r\nas their own.[12] Ennius had an imitator in M. Terentius Varro. The\r\nsatires of these first writers are said to have been very irregular\r\ncompositions, mixing prose with verse, and sometimes even Greek with\r\nLatin; and to have been rather general in their aim than personal. But\r\nsoon after this period, and rather more than a century before Christ,\r\ncame Caius Lucilius, who raised Roman satirical literature to its\r\nperfection. Lucilius, we are told, was the first who wrote satires in\r\nheroic verse, or hexameters, mixing with them now and then, though\r\nrarely, an iambic or trochaic line. He was more refined, more pointed,\r\nand more personal, than his predecessors, and he had rescued satire\r\nfrom the street performer to make it a class of literature which was\r\nto be read by the educated, and not merely listened to by the vulgar.\r\nLucilius is said to have written thirty books of satires, of which,\r\nunfortunately, only some scattered lines remain.\r\n\r\n [12] Quintilian says, \"_Satira quidem tota nostra est_.\" De Instit.\r\n      Orator., lib. x. c. 1.\r\n\r\nLucilius had imitators, the very names of most of whom are now\r\nforgotten, but about forty years after his death, and sixty-five\r\nyears before the birth of Christ, was born Quintus Horatius Flaccus,\r\nthe oldest of the satirists whose works we now possess, and the most\r\npolished of Roman poets. In the time of Horace, the satire of the\r\nRomans had reached its highest degree of perfection. Of the two other\r\ngreat satirists whose works are preserved, Juvenal was born about the\r\nyear 40 of the Christian era, and Persius in 43. During the period\r\nthrough which these writers flourished, Rome saw a considerable number\r\nof other satirists of the same class, whose works have perished.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Juvenal another variety of the same class of literature\r\nhad already sprung up, more artificial and somewhat more indirect\r\nthan the other, the prose satiric romance. Three celebrated writers\r\nrepresent this school. Petronius, who, born about the commencement\r\nof our era, died in A.D. 65, is the earliest and most remarkable of\r\nthem. He compiled a romance, designed as a satire on the vices of the\r\nage of Nero, in which real persons are supposed to be aimed at under\r\nfictitious names, and which rivals in license, at least, anything\r\nthat could have been uttered in the Atellanes or other farces of the\r\n_mimi_. Lucian, of Samosata, who died an old man in the year 200, and\r\nwho, though he wrote in Greek, may be considered as belonging to the\r\nRoman school, composed several satires of this kind, in one of the\r\nmost remarkable of which, entitled \"Lucius, or the Ass,\" the author\r\ndescribes himself as changed by sorcery into the form of that animal,\r\nunder which he passes through a number of adventures which illustrate\r\nthe vices and weaknesses of contemporary society. Apuleius, who was\r\nconsiderably the junior of Lucian, made this novel the groundwork of\r\nhis \"Golden Ass,\" a much larger and more elaborate work, written in\r\nLatin. This work of Apuleius was very popular through subsequent ages.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 19. The Farm-yard in Burlesque._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 20. An Asilla-Bearer._]\r\n\r\nLet us return to Roman caricature, one form of which seems to have\r\nbeen especially a favourite among the people. It is difficult to\r\nimagine how the story of the pigmies and of their wars with the cranes\r\noriginated, but it is certainly of great antiquity, as it is spoken\r\nof in Homer, and it was a very popular legend among the Romans, who\r\neagerly sought and purchased dwarfs to make domestic pets of them. The\r\npigmies and cranes occur frequently among the pictorial ornamentations\r\nof the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum; and the painters of Pompeii\r\nnot only represented them in their proper character, but they made use\r\nof them for the purpose of caricaturing the various occupations of\r\nlife--domestic and social scenes, grave conferences, and many other\r\nsubjects, and even personal character. In this class of caricatures\r\nthey gave to the pigmies, or dwarfs, very large heads, and very small\r\nlegs and arms. I need hardly remark that this is a class of caricature\r\nwhich is very common in modern times. Our first group of these pigmy\r\ncaricatures (No. 19) is taken from a painting on the walls of the\r\nTemple of Venus, at Pompeii, and represents the interior of a farm-yard\r\nin burlesque. The structure in the background is perhaps intended for a\r\nhayrick. In front of it, one of the farm servants is attending on the\r\npoultry. The more important-looking personage with the pastoral staff\r\nis possibly the overseer of the farm, who is visiting the labourers,\r\nand this probably is the cause why their movements have assumed so much\r\nactivity. The labourer on the right is using the _asilla_, a wooden\r\nyoke or pole, which was carried over the shoulder, with the _corbis_,\r\nor basket, suspended at each end. This was a common method of carrying,\r\nand is not unfrequently represented on Roman works of art. Several\r\nexamples might be quoted from the antiquities of Pompeii. Our cut No.\r\n20, from a gem in the Florentine Museum, and illustrating another class\r\nof caricature, that of introducing animals performing the actions and\r\nduties of men, represents a grasshopper carrying the _asilla_ and the\r\n_corbes_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 21. A Painter's Studio._]\r\n\r\nA private house in Pompeii furnished another example of this style\r\nof caricature, which is given in our cut No. 21. It represents the\r\ninterior of a painter's studio, and is extremely curious on account\r\nof the numerous details of his method of operation with which it\r\nfurnishes us. The painter, who is, like most of the figures in these\r\npigmy caricatures, very scantily clothed, is occupied with the portrait\r\nof another, who, by the rather exaggerated fulness of the gathering\r\nof his toga, is evidently intended for a dashing and fashionable\r\npatrician, though he is seated as bare-legged and bare-breeched as the\r\nartist himself. Both are distinguished by a large allowance of nose.\r\nThe easel here employed resembles greatly the same article now in use,\r\nand might belong to the studio of a modern painter. Before it is a\r\nsmall table, probably formed of a slab of stone, which serves for a\r\npalette, on which the painter spreads and mixes his colours. To the\r\nright a servant, who fills the office of colour-grinder, is seated by\r\nthe side of a vessel placed over hot coals, and appears to be preparing\r\ncolours, mixed, according to the directions given in old writers,\r\nwith punic wax and oil. In the background is seated a student, whose\r\nattention is taken from his drawing by what is going on at the other\r\nside of the room, where two small personages are entering, who look as\r\nif they were amateurs, and who appear to be talking about the portrait.\r\nBehind them stands a bird, and when the painting was first uncovered\r\nthere were two. Mazois, who made the drawing from which our cut is\r\ntaken, before the original had perished--for it was found in a state\r\nof decay--imagined that the birds typified some well-known singers or\r\nmusicians, but they are, perhaps, merely intended for cranes, birds so\r\ngenerally associated with the pigmies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 22. Part of a Triumphal Procession._]\r\n\r\nAccording to an ancient writer, combats of pigmies were favourite\r\nrepresentations on the walls of taverns and shops;[13] and, curiously\r\nenough, the walls of a shop in Pompeii have furnished the picture\r\nrepresented in our cut No. 22, which has evidently been intended for\r\na caricature, probably a parody. All the pigmies in this picture\r\nare crowned with laurel, as though the painter intended to turn to\r\nridicule some over-pompous triumph, or some public, perhaps religious,\r\nceremony. The two figures to the left, who are clothed in yellow\r\nand green garments, appear to be disputing the possession of a bowl\r\ncontaining a liquid. One of these, like the two figures on the right,\r\nhas a hoop thrown over his shoulder. The first of the latter personages\r\nwears a violet dress, and holds in his right hand a rod, and in his\r\nleft a statuette, apparently of a deity, but its attributes are not\r\ndistinguishable. The last figure to the right has a robe, or mantle, of\r\ntwo colours, red and green, and holds in his hand a branch of a lily,\r\nor some similar plant; the rest of the picture is lost. Behind the\r\nother figure stands a fifth, who appears younger and more refined in\r\ncharacter than the others, and seems to be ordering or directing them.\r\nHis dress is red.\r\n\r\n [13] ἐπί των καπηλίων. Problem. Aristotelic. Sec. x. 7.\r\n\r\nWe can have no doubt that political and personal caricature flourished\r\namong the Romans, as we have some examples of it on their works of art,\r\nchiefly on engraved stones, though these are mostly of a character\r\nwe could not here conveniently introduce; but the same rich mine of\r\nRoman art and antiquities, Pompeii, has furnished us with one sample\r\nof what may be properly considered as a political caricature. In the\r\nyear 59 of the Christian era, at a gladiatorial exhibition in the\r\namphitheatre of Pompeii, where the people of Nuceria were present,\r\nthe latter expressed themselves in such scornful terms towards the\r\nPompeians, as led to a violent quarrel, which was followed by a pitched\r\nbattle between the inhabitants of the two towns, and the Nucerians,\r\nbeing defeated, carried their complaints before the reigning emperor,\r\nNero, who gave judgment in their favour, and condemned the people of\r\nPompeii to suspension from all theatrical amusements for ten years.\r\nThe feelings of the Pompeians on this occasion are displayed in the\r\nrude drawing represented in our cut No. 23, which is scratched on the\r\nplaster of the external wall of a house in the street to which the\r\nItalian antiquarians have given the name of the street of Mercury. A\r\nfigure, completely armed, his head covered with what might be taken\r\nfor a mediæval helmet, is descending what appear to be intended for\r\nthe steps of the amphitheatre. He carries in his hand a palm-branch,\r\nthe emblem of victory. Another palm-branch stands erect by his side,\r\nand underneath is the inscription, in rather rustic Latin, \"CAMPANI\r\nVICTORIA VNA CVM NVCERINIS PERISTIS\"--\"O Campanians, you perished in\r\nthe victory together with the Nucerians.\" The other side of the picture\r\nis more rudely and hastily drawn. It has been supposed to represent\r\none of the victors dragging a prisoner, with his arms bound, up a\r\nladder to a stage or platform, on which he was perhaps to be exhibited\r\nto the jeers of the populace. Four years after this event, Pompeii\r\nwas greatly damaged by an earthquake, and sixteen years later came\r\nthe eruption of Vesuvius, which buried the town, and left it in the\r\ncondition in which it is now found.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 23. A Popular Caricature._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 24. Early Caricature upon a Christian._]\r\n\r\nThis curious caricature belongs to a class of monuments to which\r\narchæologists have given technically the Italian name of _graffiti_,\r\nscratches or scrawls, of which a great number, consisting chiefly of\r\nwriting, have been found on the walls of Pompeii. They also occur\r\namong the remains on other Roman sites, and one found in Rome itself\r\nis especially interesting. During the alterations and extensions which\r\nwere made from time to time in the palace of the Cæsars, it had been\r\nfound necessary to build across a narrow street which intersected the\r\nPalatine, and, in order to give support to the structure above, a\r\nportion of the street was walled off, and remained thus hermetically\r\nsealed until about the year 1857, when some excavations on the spot\r\nbrought it to view. The walls of the street were found to be covered\r\nwith these _graffiti_, among which one attracted especial attention,\r\nand, having been carefully removed, is now preserved in the museum\r\nof the Collegio Romano. It is a caricature upon a Christian named\r\nAlexamenos, by some pagan who despised Christianity. The Saviour is\r\nrepresented under the form of a man with the head of an ass, extended\r\nupon a cross, the Christian, Alexamenos, standing on one side in the\r\nattitude of worship of that period. Underneath we read the inscription,\r\nΑΛΕΞΑΜΕΝΟΣ CΕΒΕΤΕ (for σεβεται), \"Alexamenos worships God.\" This\r\ncurious figure, which may be placed among the most interesting as well\r\nas early evidences of the truth of Gospel history, is copied in our cut\r\nNo. 24. It was drawn when the prevailing religion at Rome was still\r\npagan, and a Christian was an object of contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE PERIOD OF TRANSITION FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE MIDDLE AGES.--THE\r\n     ROMAN MIMI CONTINUED TO EXIST.--THE TEUTONIC AFTER-DINNER\r\n     ENTERTAINMENTS.--CLERICAL SATIRES; ARCHBISHOP HERIGER AND THE\r\n     DREAMER; THE SUPPER OF THE SAINTS.--TRANSITION FROM ANCIENT\r\n     TO MEDIÆVAL ART.--TASTE FOR MONSTROUS ANIMALS, DRAGONS, ETC.;\r\n     CHURCH OF SAN FEDELE, AT COMO.--SPIRIT OF CARICATURE AND LOVE\r\n     OF GROTESQUE AMONG THE ANGLO-SAXONS.--GROTESQUE FIGURES OF\r\n     DEMONS.--NATURAL TENDENCY OF THE EARLY MEDIÆVAL ARTISTS TO DRAW IN\r\n     CARICATURE.--EXAMPLES FROM EARLY MANUSCRIPTS AND SCULPTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transition from antiquity to what we usually understand by the name\r\nof the middle ages was long and slow; it was a period during which much\r\nof the texture of the old society was destroyed, while at the same\r\ntime a new life was gradually given to that which remained. We know\r\nvery little of the comic literature of this period of transition; its\r\nliterary remains consist chiefly of a mass of heavy theology and of\r\nlives of saints. The stage in its perfectly dramatic form--theatre and\r\namphitheatre--had disappeared. The pure drama, indeed, appears never\r\nto have had great vitality among the Romans, whose tastes lay far more\r\namong the vulgar performances of the mimics and jesters, and among\r\nthe savage scenes of the amphitheatre. While probably the performance\r\nof comedies, such as those of Plautus and Terence, soon went out of\r\nfashion, and tragedies, like those of Seneca, were only written as\r\nliterary compositions, imitations of the similar works which formed\r\nso remarkable a feature in the literature of Greece, the Romans of\r\nall ranks loved to witness the loose attitudes of their _mimi_, or\r\nlisten to their equally loose songs and stories. The theatre and the\r\namphitheatre were state institutions, kept up at the national expense,\r\nand, as just stated, they perished with the overthrow of the western\r\nempire; and the sanguinary performances of the amphitheatre, if the\r\namphitheatre itself continued to be used (which was perhaps the case\r\nin some parts of western Europe), and they gave place to the more\r\nharmless exhibitions of dancing bears and other tamed animals,[14] for\r\ndeliberate cruelty was not a characteristic of the Teutonic race. But\r\nthe mimi, the performers who sung songs and told stories, accompanied\r\nwith dancing and music, survived the fall of the empire, and continued\r\nto be as popular as ever. St. Augustine, in the fourth century, calls\r\nthese things _nefaria_, detestable things, and says that they were\r\nperformed at night.[15] We trace in the capitularies the continuous\r\nexistence of these performances during the ages which followed the\r\nempire, and, as in the time of St. Augustine, they still formed the\r\namusement of nocturnal assemblies. The capitulary of Childebert\r\nproscribes those who passed their nights with drunkenness, jesting,\r\nand songs.[16] The council of Narbonne, in the year 589, forbade\r\npeople to spend their nights \"with dancings and filthy songs.\"[17] The\r\ncouncil of Mayence, in 813, calls these songs \"filthy and licentious\"\r\n(_turpia atque luxuriosa_); and that of Paris speaks of them as\r\n\"obscene and filthy\" (_obscæna et turpia_); while in another they are\r\ncalled \"frivolous and diabolic.\" From the bitterness with which the\r\necclesiastical ordinances are expressed, it is probable that these\r\nperformances continued to preserve much of their old paganism; yet it\r\nis curious that they are spoken of in these capitularies and acts of\r\nthe councils as being still practised in the religious festivals, and\r\neven in the churches, so tenaciously did the old sentiments of the\r\nrace keep their possession of the minds of the populace, long after\r\nthey had embraced Christianity. These \"songs,\" as they are called,\r\ncontinued also to consist not only of general, but of personal satire,\r\nand contained scandalous stories of persons living, and well known to\r\nthose who heard them. A capitulary of the Frankish king Childeric III.,\r\npublished in the year 744, is directed against those who compose and\r\nsing songs in defamation of others (_in blasphemiam alterius_, to use\r\nthe rather energetic language of the original); and it is evident that\r\nthis offence was a very common one, for it is not unfrequently repeated\r\nin later records of this character in the same words or in words to the\r\nsame purpose. Thus one result of the overthrow of the Roman empire was\r\nto leave comic literature almost in the same condition in which it was\r\nfound by Thespis in Greece and by Livius Andronicus in Rome. There was\r\nnothing in it which would be contrary to the feelings of the new races\r\nwho had now planted themselves in the Roman provinces.\r\n\r\n [14] On this subject, see my \"History of Domestic Manners and\r\n      Sentiments,\" p. 65. The dancing bear appears to have been a\r\n      favourite performer among the Germans at a very early period.\r\n\r\n [15] Per totam noctem cantabantur hic nefaria et a cantatoribus\r\n      saltabatur. Augustini Serm. 311, part v.\r\n\r\n [16] Noctes pervigiles cum ebrietate, scurrilitate, vel canticis. See\r\n      the Capitulary in Labbei Concil., vol. v.\r\n\r\n [17] Ut populi.....saltationibus et turpibus invigilant canticis.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic and Scandinavian nations had no doubt their popular\r\nfestivals, in which mirth and frolic bore sway, though we know little\r\nabout them; but there were circumstances in their domestic manners\r\nwhich implied a necessity for amusement. After the comparatively early\r\nmeal, the hall of the primitive Teuton was the scene--especially in the\r\ndarker months of winter--of long sittings over the festive board, in\r\nwhich there was much drinking and much talking, and, as we all know,\r\nsuch talking could not preserve long a very serious tone. From Bede's\r\naccount of the poet Cædmon, we learn that it was the practice of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons in the seventh century, at their entertainments, for all\r\nthose present to sing in their turns, each accompanying himself with a\r\nmusical instrument. From the sequel of the story we are led to suppose\r\nthat these songs were extemporary effusions, probably mythic legends,\r\nstories of personal adventure, praise of themselves, or vituperation\r\nof their enemies. In the chieftain's household there appears to have\r\nbeen usually some individual who acted the part of the satirist, or, as\r\nwe should perhaps now say, the comedian. Hunferth appears as holding\r\nsome such position in Beowulf; in the later romances, Sir Kay held a\r\nsimilar position at the court of king Arthur. At a still later period,\r\nthe place of these heroes was occupied by the court fool. The Roman\r\n_mimus_ must have been a welcome addition to the entertainments of the\r\nTeutonic hall, and there is every reason to think that he was cordially\r\nreceived. The performances of the hall were soon delegated from the\r\nguests to such hired actors, and we have representations of them in\r\nthe illuminations of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.[18] Among the earliest\r\namusements of the Anglo-Saxon table were riddles, which in every form\r\npresent some of the features of the comic, and are capable of being\r\nmade the source of much laughter. The saintly Aldhelm condescended to\r\nwrite such riddles in Latin verse, which were, of course, intended for\r\nthe tables of the clergy. In primitive society, verse was the ordinary\r\nform of conveying ideas. A large portion of the celebrated collection\r\nof Anglo-Saxon poetry known as the \"Exeter Book,\" consists of riddles,\r\nand this taste for riddles has continued to exist down to our own\r\ntimes. But other forms of entertainment, if they did not already\r\nexist, were soon introduced. In a curious Latin poem, older than the\r\ntwelfth century, of which fragments only are preserved, and have been\r\npublished under the title of \"Ruodlieb,\" and which appears to have\r\nbeen a translation of a much earlier German romance, we have a curious\r\ndescription of the post-prandial entertainments after the dinner of a\r\ngreat Teutonic chieftain, or king. In the first place there was a grand\r\ndistribution of rich presents, and then were shown strange animals, and\r\namong the rest tame bears. These bears stood upon their hind legs, and\r\nperformed some of the offices of a man; and when the minstrels (_mimi_)\r\ncame in, and played upon their musical instruments, these animals\r\ndanced to the music, and performed all sorts of strange tricks.\r\n\r\n          _Et pariles ursi....\r\n          Qui vas tollebant, ut homo, bipedesque gerebant.\r\n          Mimi quando fides digitis tangunt modulantes,\r\n          Illi saltabant, neumas pedibus variabant.\r\n          Interdum saliunt, seseque super jaciebant.\r\n          Alterutrum dorso se portabant residendo,\r\n          Amplexando se, luctando deficiunt se._\r\n\r\nThen followed dancing-girls, and exhibitions of other kinds.[19]\r\n\r\n [18] The reader is referred, for further information on this subject,\r\n      to my \"History of Domestic Manners and Sentiments,\" pp. 33-39.\r\n\r\n [19] This curious Latin poem was printed by Grimm and Schmeller, in\r\n      their Lateinische Gedichte des x. und xi. Jh., p. 129.\r\n\r\nAlthough these performances were proscribed by the ecclesiastical laws,\r\nthey were not discountenanced by the ecclesiastics themselves, who, on\r\nthe contrary, indulged as much in after-dinner amusements as anybody.\r\nThe laws against the profane songs are often directed especially at\r\nthe clergy; and it is evident that among the Anglo-Saxons, as well as\r\non the Continent, not only the priests and monks, but the nuns also,\r\nin their love of such amusements, far transgressed the bounds of\r\ndecency.[22] These entertainments were the cradle of comic literature,\r\nbut, as this literature in the early ages of its history was rarely\r\ncommitted to writing, it has almost entirely perished. But, at the\r\ntables of the ecclesiastics, these stories were sometimes told in\r\nLatin verse, and as Latin was not so easily carried in the memory as\r\nthe vernacular tongue, in this language they were sometimes committed\r\nto writing, and thus a few examples of early comic literature have\r\nfortunately been preserved. These consist chiefly of popular stories,\r\nwhich were among the favourite amusements of mediæval society--stories\r\nmany of which are derived from the earliest period of the history of\r\nour race, and are still cherished among our peasantry. Such are the\r\nstories of the Child of Snow, and of the Mendacious Hunter, preserved\r\nin a manuscript of the eleventh century.[21] The first of these was\r\na very popular story in the middle ages. According to this early\r\nversion, a merchant of Constance, in Switzerland, was detained abroad\r\nfor several years, during which time his wife made other acquaintance,\r\nand bore a child. On his return, she excused her fault by telling him\r\nthat on a cold wintry day she had swallowed snow, by which she had\r\nconceived; and, in revenge, the husband carried away the child, and\r\nsold it into slavery, and returning, told its mother, that the infant\r\nwhich had originated in snow, had melted away under a hotter sun. Some\r\nof these stories originated in the different collections of fables,\r\nwhich were part of the favourite literature of the later Roman period.\r\nAnother is rather a ridiculous story of an ass belonging to two sisters\r\nin a nunnery, which was devoured by a wolf.[20] curious how soon the\r\nmediæval clergy began to imitate their pagan predecessors in parodying\r\nreligious subjects and forms, of which we have one or two very curious\r\nexamples. Visits to purgatory, hell, and paradise, in body or spirit,\r\nwere greatly in fashion during the earlier part of the middle ages,\r\nand afforded extremely good material for satire. In a metrical Latin\r\nstory, preserved in a manuscript of the eleventh century, we are\r\ntold how a \"prophet,\" or visionary, went to Heriger, archbishop of\r\nMayence from 912 to 926, and told him that he had been carried in a\r\nvision to the regions below, and described them as a place surrounded\r\nby thick woods. It was the Teutonic notion of hell, and indeed of\r\nall settlements of peoples; and Heriger replied with a sneer that he\r\nwould send his herdsmen there with his lean swine to fatten them. Each\r\n\"mark,\" or land of a family or clan, in the early Teutonic settlements,\r\nwas surrounded by woodland, which was common to all members of the clan\r\nfor fattening their swine and hunting. The false dreamer added, that he\r\nwas afterwards carried to heaven, where he saw Christ sitting at the\r\ntable and eating. John the Baptist was butler, and served excellent\r\nwine round to the saints, who were the Lord's guests. St. Peter was\r\nthe chief cook. After some remarks on the appointments to these two\r\noffices, archbishop Heriger asked the informant how he was received in\r\nthe heavenly hall, where he sat, and what he eat. He replied that he\r\nsat in a corner, and stole from the cooks a piece of liver, which he\r\neat, and then departed. Instead of rewarding him for his information,\r\nHeriger took him on his own confession for the theft, and ordered him\r\nto be bound to a stake and flogged, which, for the offence, was rather\r\na light punishment.\r\n\r\n [20] On the character of the nuns among the Anglo-Saxons, and indeed of\r\n      the inmates of the monastic houses generally, I would refer my\r\n      readers to the excellent and interesting volume by Mr. John\r\n      Thrupp, \"The Anglo-Saxon Home: a History of the Domestic\r\n      Institutions and Customs of England from the fifth to the eleventh\r\n      century.\" London, 1862.\r\n\r\n [21] These will be found in M. Edélestand du Méril's Poésies Populaires\r\n      Latines antérieures au douzième siècle, pp. 275, 276.\r\n\r\n [22] This, and the metrical story next referred to, were printed in\r\n      the \"Altdeutsche Blätter,\" edited by Moriz Haupt and Heinrich\r\n      Hoffmann, vol. i. pp. 390, 392, to whom I communicated them from\r\n      a manuscript in the University Library at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n                    _Heriger illum\r\n                    jussit ad palum\r\n                    loris ligari,\r\n                    scopisque cedi,\r\n                    sermone duro\r\n                    hunc arguendo._\r\n\r\nThese lines will serve as a specimen of the popular Latin verse in\r\nwhich these monkish after-dinner stories were written; but the most\r\nremarkable of these early parodies on religious subjects, is one which\r\nmay be described as the supper of the saints; its title is simply\r\n_Cœna_. It is falsely ascribed to St. Cyprian, who lived in the\r\nthird century; but it is as old as the tenth century, as a copy was\r\nprinted by professor Endlicher from a manuscript of that period at\r\nVienna. It was so popular, that it is found and known to have existed\r\nin different forms in verse and in prose. It is a sort of drollery,\r\nfounded upon the wedding feast at which the Saviour changed water into\r\nwine, though that miracle is not at all introduced into it. It was a\r\ngreat king of the East, named Zoel, who held his nuptial feast at Cana\r\nof Galilee. The personages invited are all scriptural, beginning with\r\nAdam. Before the feast, they wash in the river Jordan, and the number\r\nof the guests was so great, that seats could not be provided for them,\r\nand they took their places as they could. Adam took the first place,\r\nand seated himself in the middle of the assembly, and next to him Eve\r\nsat upon leaves (_super folia_),--fig-leaves, we may suppose. Cain sat\r\non a plough, Abel on a milk-pail, Noah on an ark, Japhet on tiles,\r\nAbraham on a tree, Isaac on an altar, Lot near the door, and so with\r\na long list of others. Two were obliged to stand--Paul, who bore it\r\npatiently, and Esau, who grumbled--while Job lamented bitterly because\r\nhe was obliged to sit on a dunghill. Moses, and others, who came late,\r\nwere obliged to find seats out of doors. When the king saw that all\r\nhis guests had arrived, he took them into his wardrobe, and there, in\r\nthe spirit of mediæval generosity, distributed to them dresses, which\r\nhad all some burlesque allusion to their particular characters. Before\r\nthey were allowed to sit down to the feast, they were obliged to go\r\nthrough other ceremonies, which, as well as the eating, are described\r\nin the same style of caricature. The wines, of which there was great\r\nvariety, were served to the guests with the same allusions to their\r\nindividual characters; but some of them complained that they were badly\r\nmixed, although Jonah was the butler. In the same manner are described\r\nthe proceedings which followed the dinner, the washing of hands, and\r\nthe dessert, to the latter of which Adam contributed apples, Samson\r\nhoney; while David played on the harp and Mary on the tabor; Judith led\r\nthe round dance; Jubal played on the psalter; Asael sung songs, and\r\nHerodias acted the part of the dancing-girl:--\r\n\r\n          _Tunc Adam poma ministrat, Samson favi dulcia.\r\n          David cytharum percussit, et Maria tympana.\r\n          Judith choreas ducebat, et Jubal psalteria.\r\n          Asael metra canebat, saltabat Herodias._\r\n\r\nMambres entertained the company with his magical performances; and\r\nthe other incidents of a mediæval festival followed, throughout which\r\nthe same tone of burlesque is continued; and so the story continues,\r\nto the end.[23] We shall find these incipient forms of mediæval comic\r\nliterature largely developed as we go on.\r\n\r\n [23] The text of this singular composition, with a full account of the\r\n      various forms in which it was published, will be found in M. du\r\n      Méril's \"Poésies Populaires Latines antérieures au douzième\r\n      siècle,\" p. 193.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 25. Saturn Devouring his Child._]\r\n\r\nThe period between antiquity and the middle ages was one of such great\r\nand general destruction, that the gulf between ancient and mediæval art\r\nseems to us greater and more abrupt than it really was. The want of\r\nmonuments, no doubt, prevents our seeing the gradual change of one into\r\nthe other, but nevertheless enough of facts remain to convince us that\r\nit was not a sudden change. It is now indeed generally understood that\r\nthe knowledge and practice of the arts and manufactures of the Romans\r\nwere handed onward from master to pupil after the empire had fallen;\r\nand this took place especially in the towns, so that the workmanship\r\nwhich had been declining in character during the later periods of the\r\nempire, only continued in the course of degradation afterwards. Thus,\r\nin the first Christian edifices, the builders who were employed, or at\r\nleast many of them, must have been pagans, and they would follow their\r\nold models of ornamentation, introducing the same grotesque figures,\r\nthe same masks and monstrous faces, and even sometimes the same\r\nsubjects from the old mythology, to which they had been accustomed. It\r\nis to be observed, too, that this kind of iconographical ornamentation\r\nhad been encroaching more and more upon the old architectural purity\r\nduring the latter ages of the empire, and that it was employed more\r\nprofusely in the later works, from which this taste was transferred\r\nto the ecclesiastical and to the domestic architecture of the middle\r\nages. After the workmen themselves had become Christians, they still\r\nfound pagan emblems and figures in their models, and still went on\r\nimitating them, sometimes merely copying, and at others turning them\r\nto caricature or burlesque. And this tendency continued so long, that,\r\nat a much later date, where there still existed remains of Roman\r\nbuildings, the mediæval architects adopted them as models, and did not\r\nhesitate to copy the sculpture, although it might be evidently pagan in\r\ncharacter. The accompanying cut (No. 25) represents a bracket in the\r\nchurch of Mont Majour, near Nismes, built in the tenth century. The\r\nsubject is a monstrous head eating a child, and we can hardly doubt\r\nthat it was really intended for a caricature on Saturn devouring one of\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\nSometimes the mediæval sculptors mistook the emblematical designs\r\nof the Romans, and misapplied them, and gave an allegorical meaning\r\nto that which was not intended to be emblematical or allegorical,\r\nuntil the subjects themselves became extremely confused. They readily\r\nemployed that class of parody of the ancients in which animals were\r\nrepresented performing the actions of men, and they had a great taste\r\nfor monsters of every description, especially those which were made up\r\nof portions of incongruous animals joined together, in contradiction to\r\nthe precept of Horace:--\r\n\r\n          _Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam\r\n          Jungere si velit, et varias inducere plumas,\r\n          Undique collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum\r\n          Desinet in piscem mulier formosa superne;\r\n          Spectatum admissi risum teneatis, amici?_\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 26. Sculpture from San Fedele, at Como._]\r\n\r\nThe mediæval architects loved such representations, always and in all\r\nparts, and examples are abundant. At Como, in Italy, there is a very\r\nancient and remarkable church dedicated to San Fedele (Saint Fidelis);\r\nit has been considered to be of so early a date as the fifth century.\r\nThe sculptures that adorn the doorway, which is triangular-headed, are\r\nespecially interesting. On one of these, represented in our cut No. 26,\r\nin a compartment to the left, appears a figure of an angel, holding in\r\none hand a dwarf figure, probably intended for a child, by a lock of\r\nhis hair, and with the other hand directing his attention to a seated\r\nfigure in the compartment below. This latter figure has apparently the\r\nhead of a sheep, and as the head is surrounded with a large nimbus,\r\nand the right hand is held out in the attitude of benediction, it\r\nmay be intended to represent the Lamb. This personage is seated on\r\nsomething which is difficult to make out, but which looks somewhat\r\nlike a crab-fish. The boy in the compartment above carries a large\r\nbasin in his arms. The adjoining compartment to the right contains the\r\nrepresentation of a conflict between a dragon, a winged serpent, and a\r\nwinged fox. On the opposite side of the door, two winged monsters are\r\nrepresented devouring a lamb's head. I owe the drawing from which this\r\nand the preceding engraving were made to my friend Mr. John Robinson,\r\nthe architect, who made the sketches while travelling with the medal\r\nof the Royal Academy. Figures of dragons, as ornaments, were great\r\nfavourites with the peoples of the Teutonic race; they were creatures\r\nintimately wrapped up in their national mythology and romance, and they\r\nare found on all their artistic monuments mingled together in grotesque\r\nforms and groups. When the Anglo-Saxons began to ornament their books,\r\nthe dragon was continually introduced for ornamental borders and\r\nin forming initial letters. One of the latter, from an Anglo-Saxon\r\nmanuscript of the tenth century (the well-known manuscript of Cædmon,\r\nwhere it is given as an initial V), is represented in our cut on the\r\nnext page, No. 27.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 27. Anglo-Saxon Dragons._]\r\n\r\nCaricature and burlesque are naturally intended to be heard and seen\r\npublicly, and would therefore be figured on such monuments as were most\r\nexposed to popular gaze. Such was the case, in the earlier periods of\r\nthe middle ages, chiefly with ecclesiastical buildings, which explains\r\nhow they became the grand receptacles of this class of Art. We have few\r\ntraces of what may be termed comic literature among our Anglo-Saxon\r\nforefathers, but this is fully explained by the circumstance that very\r\nlittle of the popular Anglo-Saxon literature has been preserved. In\r\ntheir festive hours the Anglo-Saxons seem to have especially amused\r\nthemselves in boasting of what they had done, and what they could do;\r\nand these boasts were perhaps often of a burlesque character, like the\r\n_gabs_ of the French and Anglo-Norman romancers of a later date, or\r\nso extravagant as to produce laughter. The chieftains appear also to\r\nhave encouraged men who could make jokes, and satirise and caricature\r\nothers; for the company of such men seems to have been cherished, and\r\nthey are not unfrequently introduced in the stories. Such a personage,\r\nas I have remarked before, is Hunferth in Beowulf; such was the Sir\r\nKay of the later Arthurian romances; and such too was the Norman\r\nminstrel in the history of Hereward, who amused the Norman soldiers at\r\ntheir feasts by mimicry of the manners of their Anglo-Saxon opponents.\r\nThe too personal satire of these wits often led to quarrels, which\r\nended in sanguinary brawls. The Anglo-Saxon love of caricature is\r\nshown largely in their proper names, which were mostly significant of\r\npersonal qualities their parents hoped they would possess; and in these\r\nwe remark the proneness of the Teutonic race, as well as the peoples\r\nof antiquity, to represent these qualities by the animals supposed to\r\npossess them, the animals most popular being the wolf and the bear.\r\nBut it is not to be expected that the hopes of the parents in giving\r\nthe name would always be fulfilled, and it is not an uncommon thing\r\nto find individuals losing their original names to receive in their\r\nplace nicknames, or names which probably expressed qualities they did\r\npossess, and which were given to them by their acquaintances. These\r\nnames, though often not very complimentary, and even sometimes very\r\nmuch the contrary, completely superseded the original name, and were\r\neven accepted by the individuals to whom they applied. The second names\r\nwere indeed so generally acknowledged, that they were used in signing\r\nlegal documents. An Anglo-Saxon abbess of rank, whose real name was\r\nHrodwaru, but who was known universally by the name Bugga, the Bug,\r\nwrote this latter name in signing charters. We can hardly doubt that\r\nsuch a name was intended to ascribe to her qualities of a not agreeable\r\ncharacter, and very different to those implied by the original name,\r\nwhich perhaps meant, a dweller in heaven. Another lady gained the name\r\nof the Crow. It is well known that surnames did not come into use\r\ntill long after the Anglo-Saxon period, but appellatives, like these\r\nnicknames, were often added to the name for the purpose of distinction,\r\nor at pleasure, and these, too, being given by other people, were\r\nfrequently satirical. Thus, one Harold, for his swiftness, was called\r\nHare-foot; a well-known Edith, for the elegant form of her neck,\r\nwas called Swan-neck; and a Thurcyl, for a form of his head, which\r\ncan hardly have been called beautiful, was named Mare's-head. Among\r\nmany other names, quite as satirical as the last-mentioned, we find\r\nFlat-nose, the Ugly Squint-eye, Hawk-nose, &c.\r\n\r\nOf Anglo-Saxon sculpture we have little left, but we have a few\r\nilluminated manuscripts which present here and there an attempt at\r\ncaricature, though they are rare. It would seem, however, that the two\r\nfavourite subjects of caricature among the Anglo-Saxons were the clergy\r\nand the evil one. We have abundant evidence that, from the eighth\r\ncentury downwards, neither the Anglo-Saxon clergy nor the Anglo-Saxon\r\nnuns were generally objects of much respect among the people; and their\r\ncharacter and the manner of their lives sufficiently account for it.\r\nPerhaps, also, it was increased by the hostility between the old clergy\r\nand the new reformers of Dunstan's party, who would no doubt caricature\r\neach other. A manuscript psalter, in the University Library, Cambridge\r\n(Ff. 1, 23), of the Anglo-Saxon period, and apparently of the tenth\r\ncentury, illustrated with rather grotesque initial letters, furnishes\r\nus with the figure of a jolly Anglo-Saxon monk, given in our cut No.\r\n28, and which it is hardly necessary to state represents the letter Q.\r\nAs we proceed, we shall see the clergy continuing to furnish a butt for\r\nthe shafts of satire through all the middle ages.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 28. A Jolly Monk._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 29. Satan in Bonds._]\r\n\r\nThe inclination to give to the demons (the middle ages always looked\r\nupon them as innumerable) monstrous forms, which easily ran into the\r\ngrotesque, was natural, and the painter, indeed, prided himself on\r\ndrawing them ugly; but he was no doubt influenced in so generally\r\ncaricaturing them, by mixing up this idea with those furnished by the\r\npopular superstitions of the Teutonic race, who believed in multitudes\r\nof spirits, representatives of the ancient satyrs, who were of a\r\nplayfully malicious description, and went about plaguing mankind in\r\na very droll manner, and sometimes appeared to them in equally droll\r\nforms. They were the Pucks and Robin Goodfellows of later times;\r\nbut the Christian missionaries to the west taught their converts to\r\nbelieve, and probably believed themselves, that all these imaginary\r\nbeings were real demons, who wandered over the earth for people's ruin\r\nand destruction. Thus the grotesque imagination of the converted people\r\nwas introduced into the Christian system of demonology. It is a part of\r\nthe subject to which we shall return in our next chapter; but I will\r\nhere introduce two examples of the Anglo-Saxon demons. To explain the\r\nfirst of these, it will be necessary to state that, according to the\r\nmediæval notions, Satan, the arch demon, who had fallen from heaven\r\nfor his rebellion against the Almighty, was not a free agent who went\r\nabout tempting mankind, but he was himself plunged in the abyss,\r\nwhere he was held in bonds, and tormented by the demons who peopled\r\nthe infernal regions, and also issued thence to seek their prey upon\r\nGod's newest creation, the earth. The history of Satan's fall, and the\r\ndescription of his position (No. 29), form the subject of the earlier\r\npart of the Anglo-Saxon poetry ascribed to Cædmon, and it is one of\r\nthe illuminations to the manuscript of Cædmon (which is now preserved\r\nat Oxford), which has furnished us with our cut, representing Satan\r\nin his bonds. The fiend is here pictured bound to stakes, over what\r\nappears to be a gridiron, while one of the demons, rising out of a\r\nfiery furnace, and holding in his hand an instrument of punishment,\r\nseems to be exulting over him, and at the same time urging on the troop\r\nof grotesque imps who are swarming round and tormenting their victim.\r\nThe next cut, No. 30, is also taken from an Anglo-Saxon manuscript,\r\npreserved in the British Museum (MS. Cotton., Tiberius, C. vi.), which\r\nbelongs to the earlier half of the eleventh century, and contains a\r\ncopy of the psalter. It gives us the Anglo-Saxon notion of the demon\r\nunder another form, equally characteristic, wearing only a girdle\r\nof flames, but in this case the especial singularity of the design\r\nconsists in the eyes in the fiend's wings.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 30. Satan._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 31. The Temptation._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 32. David and the Lion._]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance had no doubt an influence on the mediæval taste\r\nfor grotesque and caricature--the natural rudeness of early mediæval\r\nart. The writers of antiquity tell us of a remote period of Grecian\r\nart when it was necessary to write under each figure of a picture the\r\nname of what it was intended to represent, in order to make the whole\r\nintelligible--\"this is a horse,\" \"this is a man,\" \"this is a tree.\"\r\nWithout being quite so rude as this, the early mediæval artists,\r\nthrough ignorance of perspective, want of knowledge of proportion, and\r\nof skill in drawing, found great difficulty in representing a scene in\r\nwhich there was more than one figure, and in which it was necessary\r\nto distinguish them from each other; and they were continually trying\r\nto help themselves by adopting conventional forms or conventional\r\npositions, and by sometimes adding symbols that did not exactly\r\nrepresent what they meant. The exaggeration in form consisted chiefly\r\nin giving an undue prominence to some characteristic feature, which\r\nanswered the same purpose as the Anglo-Saxon nickname and distinctive\r\nname, and which is, in fact, one of the first principles of all\r\ncaricature. Conventional positions partook much of the character of\r\nconventional forms, but gave still greater room for grotesque. Thus\r\nthe very first characteristics of mediæval art implied the existence\r\nof caricature, and no doubt led to the taste for the grotesque. The\r\neffect of this influence is apparent everywhere, and in innumerable\r\ncases serious pictures of the gravest and most important subjects are\r\nsimply and absolutely caricatures. Anglo-Saxon art ran much into this\r\nstyle, and is often very grotesque in character. The first example we\r\ngive (cut No. 31) is taken from one of the illustrations to Alfric's\r\nAnglo-Saxon version of the Pentateuch, in the profusely illuminated\r\nmanuscript in the British Museum (MS. Cotton., Claudius B iv.), which\r\nwas written at the end of the tenth, or beginning of the eleventh,\r\ncentury. It represents the temptation and fall of man; and the subject\r\nis treated, as will be seen, in a rather grotesque manner. Eve is\r\nevidently dictating to her husband, who, in obeying her, shows a\r\nmixture of eagerness and trepidation. Adam is no less evidently going\r\nto swallow the apple whole, which is, perhaps, in accordance with the\r\nmediæval legend, according to which the fruit stuck in his throat. It\r\nis hardly necessary to remark that the tree is entirely a conventional\r\none; and it would be difficult to imagine how it came to bear apples at\r\nall. The mediæval artists were extremely unskilful in drawing trees;\r\nto these they usually gave the forms of cabbages, or some such plants,\r\nof which the form was simple, or often of a mere bunch of leaves. Our\r\nnext example (cut No. 32) is also Anglo-Saxon, and is furnished by\r\nthe manuscript in the British Museum already mentioned (MS. Cotton.,\r\nTiberius C vi.) It probably represents young David killing the lion,\r\nand is remarkable not only for the strange posture and bad proportions\r\nof the man, but for the tranquillity of the animal and the exaggerated\r\nand violent action of its slayer. This is very commonly the case in the\r\nmediæval drawings and sculptures, the artists apparently possessing\r\nfar less skill in representing action in an animal than in man, and\r\ntherefore more rarely attempting it. These illustrations are both taken\r\nfrom illuminated manuscripts. The two which follow are furnished by\r\nsculptures, and are of a rather later date than the preceding. The\r\nabbey of St. George of Boscherville, in the diocese of Auxerre (in\r\nNormandy), was founded by Ralph de Tancarville, one of the ministers of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, and therefore in the latter half of the eleventh\r\ncentury. A history of this religious house was published by a clever\r\nlocal antiquary--M. Achille Deville--from whose work we take our cut\r\nNo. 33, one of a few rude sculptures on the abbey church, which no\r\ndoubt belonged to the original fabric. It is not difficult to recognise\r\nthe subject as Joseph taking the Virgin Mary with her Child into\r\nEgypt; but there is something exceedingly droll in the unintentional\r\ncaricature of the faces, as well as in the whole design. The Virgin\r\nMary appears without a nimbus, while the nimbus of the Infant Jesus\r\nis made to look very like a bonnet. It may be remarked that this\r\nsubject of the flight into Egypt is by no means an uncommon one in\r\nmediæval art; and a drawing of the same subject, copied in my \"History\r\nof Domestic Manners and Sentiments\" (p. 115), presents a remarkable\r\nillustration of the contrast of the skill of a Norman sculptor and of\r\nan almost contemporary Anglo-Norman illuminator. Our cut also furnishes\r\nus with evidence of the error of the old opinion that ladies rode\r\nastride in the middle ages. Even one, who by his style of art must have\r\nbeen an obscure local carver on stone, when he represented a female on\r\nhorseback, placed her in the position which has always been considered\r\nsuitable to the sex.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 33. The flight into Egypt._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 34. David and Goliah._]\r\n\r\nFor the drawing of the other sculpture to which I allude, I am indebted\r\nto Mr. Robinson. It is one of the subjects carved on the façade of\r\nthe church of St. Gilles, near Nismes, and is a work of the twelfth\r\ncentury. It appears to represent the young David slaying the giant\r\nGoliah, the latter fully armed in scale armour, and with shield and\r\nspear, like a Norman knight; while to David the artist has given a\r\nfigure which is feminine in its forms. What we might take at first\r\nsight for a basket of apples, appears to be meant for a supply of\r\nstones for the sling which the young hero carries suspended from his\r\nneck. He has slain the giant with one of these, and is cutting off his\r\nhead with his own sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THE DIABOLICAL IN CARICATURE.--MEDIÆVAL LOVE OF THE\r\n     LUDICROUS.--CAUSES WHICH MADE IT INFLUENCE THE NOTIONS\r\n     OF DEMONS.--STORIES OF THE PIOUS PAINTER AND THE ERRING\r\n     MONK.--DARKNESS AND UGLINESS CARICATURED.--THE DEMONS IN THE\r\n     MIRACLE PLAYS.--THE DEMON OF NOTRE DAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already stated in the last chapter, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the whole system of the demonology of the middle ages was\r\nderived from the older pagan mythology. The demons of the monkish\r\nlegends were simply the elves and hobgoblins of our forefathers, who\r\nhaunted woods, and fields, and waters, and delighted in misleading\r\nor plaguing mankind, though their mischief was usually of a rather\r\nmirthful character. They were represented in classical mythology by\r\nthe fauns and satyrs who had, as we have seen, much to do with the\r\nbirth of comic literature among the Greeks and Romans; but these\r\nTeutonic elves were more ubiquitous than the satyrs, as they even\r\nhaunted men's houses, and played tricks, not only of a mischievous,\r\nbut of a very familiar character. The Christian clergy did not look\r\nupon the personages of the popular superstitions as fabulous beings,\r\nbut they taught that they were all diabolical, and that they were\r\nso many agents of the evil one, constantly employed in enticing and\r\nentrapping mankind. Hence, in the mediæval legends, we frequently find\r\ndemons presenting themselves under ludicrous forms or in ludicrous\r\nsituations; or performing acts, such as eating and drinking, which are\r\nnot in accordance with their real character; or at times even letting\r\nthemselves be outwitted or entrapped by mortals in a very undignified\r\nmanner. Although they assumed any form they pleased, their natural form\r\nwas remarkable chiefly for being extremely ugly; one of them, which\r\nappeared in a wild wood, is described by Giraldus Cambrensis, who wrote\r\nat the end of the twelfth century, as being hairy, shaggy, and rough,\r\nand monstrously deformed.[24] According to a mediæval story, which\r\nwas told in different forms, a great man's cellar was once haunted by\r\nthese demons, who drank all his wine, while the owner was totally at a\r\nloss to account for its rapid disappearance. After many unsuccessful\r\nattempts to discover the depredators, some one, probably suspecting\r\nthe truth, suggested that he should mark one of the barrels with holy\r\nwater, and next morning a demon, much resembling the description given\r\nby Giraldus, was found stuck fast to the barrel. It is told also of\r\nEdward the Confessor, that he once went to see the tribute called\r\nthe Danegeld, and it was shown to him all packed up in great barrels\r\nready to be sent away--for this appears to have been the usual mode\r\nof transporting large quantities of money. The saintly king had the\r\nfaculty of being able to see spiritual beings--a sort of spiritual\r\nsecond-sight--and he beheld seated on the largest barrel, a devil, who\r\nwas \"black and hideous.\"\r\n\r\n          _Vit un déable saer desus\r\n          Le tresor, noir et hidus._--Life of S. Edward, l. 944.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 35. The Demon of the Treasure._]\r\n\r\nAn early illuminator, in a manuscript preserved in the library of\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge (MS. Trin. Col., B x. 2), has left us a\r\npictorial representation of this scene, from which I copy his notion\r\nof the form of the demon in cut No. 35. The general idea is evidently\r\ntaken from the figure of the goat, and the relationship between the\r\ndemon and the classical satyr is very evident.\r\n\r\n [24] \"Formam quandam villosam, hispidam, et hirsutam, adeoque enormiter\r\n      deformem.\" Girald. Camb., Itiner. Camb., lib. i. c. 5.\r\n\r\nUgliness was an essential characteristic of the demons, and, moreover,\r\ntheir features have usually a mirthful cast, as though they greatly\r\nenjoyed their occupation. There is a mediæval story of a young\r\nmonk, who was sacristan to an abbey, and had the directions of the\r\nbuilding and ornamentation. The carvers of stone were making admirable\r\nrepresentations of hell and paradise, in the former of which the demons\r\n\"seemed to take great delight in well tormenting their victims\"--\r\n\r\n          _Qui par semblant se delitoit\r\n          En ce que bien les tormentoit._\r\n\r\nThe sacristan, who watched the sculptors every day, was at last moved\r\nby pious zeal to try and imitate them, and he set to work to make a\r\ndevil himself, with such success, that his fiend was so black and ugly\r\nthat nobody could look at it without terror.\r\n\r\n          _Tant qu'un déable à fere emprist;\r\n          Si i mist sa poine et sa cure,\r\n          Que la forme fu si oscure\r\n          Et si laide, que cil doutast\r\n          Que entre deus oilz l'esgardast._\r\n\r\nThe sacristan, encouraged by his success--for it must be understood\r\nthat his art was a sudden inspiration (as he had not been an artist\r\nbefore)--continued his work till it was completed, and then \"it was so\r\nhorrible and so ugly, that all who saw it affirmed upon their oaths\r\nthat they had never seen so ugly a figure either in sculpture or in\r\npainting, or one which had so repulsive an appearance, or a devil which\r\nwas a better likeness than the one this monk had made for them\"--\r\n\r\n      _Si horribles fu et si lez,\r\n      Que trestouz cels que le véoient\r\n      Seur leur serement afermoient\r\n      C'onques mès si laide figure,\r\n      Ne en taille ne en peinture,\r\n      N'avoient à nul jor véue,\r\n      Qui si éust laide véue,\r\n      Ne déable miex contrefet\r\n      Que cil moines leur avoit fet._--Meon's Fabliaux, tom. ii. p. 414.\r\n\r\nThe demon himself now took offence at the affront which had been\r\nput upon him, and appearing the night following to the sacristan,\r\nreproached him with having made him so ugly, and enjoined him to break\r\nthe sculpture, and execute another representing him better looking, on\r\npain of very severe punishment; but, although this visit was repeated\r\nthrice, the pious monk refused to comply. The evil one now began to\r\nwork in another way, and, by his cunning, he drew the sacristan into a\r\ndisgraceful amour with a lady of the neighbourhood, and they plotted\r\nnot only to elope together by night, but to rob the monastery of its\r\ntreasure, which was of course in the keeping of the sacristan. They\r\nwere discovered, and caught in their flight, laden with the treasure,\r\nand the unfaithful sacristan was thrown into prison. The fiend now\r\nappeared to him, and promised to clear him out of all his trouble on\r\nthe mere condition that he should break his ugly statue, and make\r\nanother representing him as looking handsome--a bargain to which the\r\nsacristan acceded without further hesitation. It would thus appear that\r\nthe demons did not like to be represented ugly. In this case, the fiend\r\nimmediately took the form and place of the sacristan, while the latter\r\nwent to his bed as if nothing had happened. When the other monks found\r\nhim there next morning, and heard him disclaim all knowledge of the\r\nrobbery or of the prison, they hurried to the latter place, and found\r\nthe devil in chains, who, when they attempted to exorcise him, behaved\r\nin a very turbulent manner, and disappeared from their sight. The\r\nmonks believed that it was all a deception of the evil one, while the\r\nsacristan, who was not inclined to brave his displeasure a second time,\r\nperformed faithfully his part of the contract, and made a devil who\r\ndid not look ugly. In another version of the story, however, it ends\r\ndifferently. After the third warning, the monk went in defiance of the\r\ndevil, and made his picture uglier than ever; in revenge for which the\r\ndemon came unexpectedly and broke the ladder on which he was mounted\r\nat his work, whereby the monk would undoubtedly have been killed. But\r\nthe Virgin, to whom he was much devoted, came to his assistance, and,\r\nseizing him with her hand, and holding him in the air, disappointed\r\nthe devil of his purpose. It is this latter _dénouement_ which is\r\nrepresented in the cut No. 36, taken from the celebrated manuscript in\r\nthe British Museum known as \"Queen Mary's Psalter\" (MS. Reg. 2 B vii.).\r\nThe two demons employed here present, well defined, the air of mirthful\r\njollity which was evidently derived from the popular hobgoblins.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 36. The Pious Sculptor._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 37. The Monk's Disaster._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 38. The Demons Disappointed._]\r\n\r\nThere was another popular story, which also was told under several\r\nforms. The old Norman historians tell it of their duke Richard\r\nSans-Peur. There was a monk of the abbey of St. Ouen, who also held\r\nthe office of sacristan, but, neglecting the duties of his position,\r\nentered into an intrigue with a lady who dwelt in the neighbourhood,\r\nand was accustomed at night to leave the abbey secretly, and repair\r\nto her. His place as sacristan enabled him thus to leave the house\r\nunknown to the other brethren. On his way, he had to pass the little\r\nriver Robec, by means of a plank or wooden bridge, and one night\r\nthe demons, who had been watching him on his errand of sin, caught\r\nhim on the bridge, and threw him over into the water, where he was\r\ndrowned. One devil seized his soul, and would have carried it away,\r\nbut an angel came to claim him on account of his good actions, and\r\nthe dispute ran so high, that duke Richard, whose piety was as great\r\nas his courage, was called in to decide it. The same manuscript from\r\nwhich our last cut was taken has furnished our cut No. 37, which\r\nrepresents two demons tripping up the monk, and throwing him very\r\nunceremoniously into the river. The body of one of the demons here\r\nassumes the form of an animal, instead of taking, like the other, that\r\nof a man, and he is, moreover, furnished with a dragon's wings. There\r\nwas one version of this story, in which it found its place among the\r\nlegends of the Virgin Mary, instead of those of duke Richard. The\r\nmonk, in spite of his failings, had been a constant worshipper of the\r\nVirgin, and, as he was falling from the bridge into the river, she\r\nstepped forward to protect him from his persecutors, and taking hold\r\nof him with her hand, saved him from death. One of the compartments\r\nof the rather early wall-paintings in Winchester Cathedral represents\r\nthe scene according to this version of the story, and is copied in\r\nour cut No. 38. The fiends here take more fantastic shapes than we\r\nhave previously seen given to them. They remind us already of the\r\ninfinitely varied grotesque forms which the painters of the age of the\r\nRenaissance crowded together in such subjects as \"The Temptation of\r\nSt. Anthony.\" In fact these strange notions of the forms of the demons\r\nwere not only preserved through the whole period of the middle ages,\r\nbut are still hardly extinct. They appear in almost exaggerated forms\r\nin the illustrations to books of a popular religious character which\r\nappeared in the first ages of printing. I may quote, as an example, one\r\nof the cuts of an early and very rare block-book, entitled the _Ars\r\nMoriendi_, or \"Art of Dying,\" or, in a second title, _De Tentationibus\r\nMorientium_, on the temptations to which dying men are exposed. The\r\nscene, of which a part is given in the annexed cut (No. 39), is in the\r\nroom of the dying man, whose bed is surrounded by three demons, who\r\nare come to tempt him, while his relatives of both sexes are looking\r\non quite unconscious of their presence. The figures of these demons\r\nare particularly grotesque, and their ugly features betray a degree of\r\nvulgar cunning which adds not a little to this effect. The one leaning\r\nover the dying man suggests to him the words expressed in the label\r\nissuing from his mouth, _Provideas amicis_, \"provide for your friends;\"\r\nwhile the one whose head appears to the left whispers to him, _Yntende\r\nthesauro_, \"think of your treasure.\" The dying man seems grievously\r\nperplexed with the various thoughts thus suggested to him.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 39. A Mediæval Death-bed._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 40. Condemned Souls carried to their Place of\r\n                         Punishment._]\r\n\r\nWhy did the mediæval Christians think it necessary to make the devils\r\nblack and ugly? The first reply to this question which presents itself\r\nis, that the characteristics intended to be represented were the\r\nblackness and ugliness of sin. This, however, is only partially the\r\nexplanation of the fact; for there can be no doubt that the notion\r\nwas a popular one, and that it had previously existed in the popular\r\nmythology; and, as has been already remarked, the ugliness exhibited\r\nby them is a vulgar, mirthful ugliness, which makes you laugh instead\r\nof shudder. Another scene, from the interesting drawings at the foot\r\nof the pages in \"Queen Mary's Psalter,\" is given in our cut No. 40. It\r\nrepresents that most popular of mediæval pictures, and, at the same\r\ntime, most remarkable of literal interpretations, hell mouth. The\r\nentrance to the infernal regions was always represented pictorially\r\nas the mouth of a monstrous animal, where the demons appeared leaving\r\nand returning. Here they are seen bringing the sinful souls to their\r\nlast destination, and it cannot be denied that they are doing the work\r\nright merrily and jovially. In our cut No. 41, from the manuscript in\r\nthe library of Trinity College, Cambridge, which furnished a former\r\nsubject, three demons, who appear to be the guardians of the entrance\r\nto the regions below--for it is upon the brow above the monstrous mouth\r\nthat they are standing--present varieties of the diabolical form. The\r\none in the middle is the most remarkable, for he has wings not only\r\non his shoulders, but also on his knees and heels. All three have\r\nhorns; in fact, the three special characteristics of mediæval demons\r\nwere horns, hoofs--or, at least, the feet of beasts,--and tails, which\r\nsufficiently indicate the source from which the popular notions of\r\nthese beings were derived. In the cathedral of Treves, there is a mural\r\npainting by William of Cologne, a painter of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhich represents the entrance to the shades, the monstrous mouth, with\r\nits keepers, in still more grotesque forms. Our cut No. 42 gives but a\r\nsmall portion of this picture, in which the porter of the regions of\r\npunishment is sitting astride the snout of the monstrous mouth, and\r\nis sounding with a trumpet what may be supposed to be the call for\r\nthose who are condemned. Another minstrel of the same stamp, spurred,\r\nthough not booted, sits astride the tube of the trumpet, playing on\r\nthe bagpipes; and the sound which issues from the former instrument is\r\nrepresented by a host of smaller imps who are scattering themselves\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 41. The Guardians of Hell Mouth._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 42. The Trumpeter of Evil._]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that, in subjects like these, the drollery of\r\nthe scene was accidental; but, on the contrary, the mediæval artists\r\nand popular writers gave them this character purposely. The demons and\r\nthe executioners--the latter of whom were called in Latin _tortores_,\r\nand in popular old English phraseology the \"tormentours\"--were the\r\ncomic characters of the time, and the scenes in the old mysteries or\r\nreligious plays in which they were introduced were the comic scenes,\r\nor farce, of the piece. The love of burlesque and caricature was,\r\nindeed, so deeply planted in the popular mind, that it was found\r\nnecessary to introduce them even in pious works, in which such scenes\r\nas the slaughter of the innocents, where the \"knights\" and the women\r\nabused each other in vulgar language, the treatment of Christ at\r\nthe time of His trial, some parts of the scene of the crucifixion,\r\nand the day of judgment, were essentially comic. The last of these\r\nsubjects, especially, was a scene of mirth, because it often consisted\r\nthroughout of a coarse satire on the vices of the age, especially on\r\nthose which were most obnoxious to the populace, such as the pride and\r\nvanity of the higher ranks, and the extortions and frauds of usurers,\r\nbakers, taverners, and others. In the play of \"Juditium,\" or the day\r\nof doom, in the \"Towneley Mysteries,\" one of the earliest collections\r\nof mysteries in the English language, the whole conversation among\r\nthe demons is exactly of that joking kind which we might expect from\r\ntheir countenances in the pictures. When one of them appears carrying\r\na bag full of different offences, another, his companion, is so joyful\r\nat this circumstance, that he says it makes him laugh till he is out\r\nof breath, or, in other words, till he is ready to burst; and, while\r\nasking if anger be not among the sins he had collected, proposes to\r\ntreat him with something to drink--\r\n\r\n    Primus dæmon. _Peasze, I pray the, be stille; I laghe that I kynke.\r\n  Is oghte ire in thi bille? and then salle thou drynke._\r\n                                        --Towneley Mysteries, p. 309.\r\n\r\nAnd in the continuation of the conversation, one telling of the events\r\nwhich had preceded the announcement of Doomsday says, rather jeeringly,\r\nand somewhat exultingly, \"Souls came so thick now of late to hell, that\r\nour porter at hell gate is ever held so close at work, up early and\r\ndown late, that he never rests\"--\r\n\r\n          _Saules cam so thyk now late unto helle,\r\n                      As ever\r\n          Oure porter at helle gate\r\n          Is halden so strate,\r\n          Up erly and downe late,\r\n                      He rystys never._--Ib., p. 314.\r\n\r\nWith such popular notions on the subject, we have no reason to be\r\nsurprised that the artists of the middle ages frequently chose the\r\nfigures of demons as objects on which to exercise their skill in\r\nburlesque and caricature, that they often introduced grotesque figures\r\nof their heads and bodies in the sculptured ornamentation of building,\r\nand that they presented them in ludicrous situations and attitudes in\r\ntheir pictures. They are often brought in as secondary actors in a\r\npicture in a very singular manner, of which an excellent example is\r\nfurnished by the beautifully illuminated manuscript known as \"Queen\r\nMary's Psalter,\" which is copied in our cut No. 43. Nothing is more\r\ncertain than that in this instance the intention of the artist was\r\nperfectly serious. Eve, under the influence of a rather singularly\r\nformed serpent, having the head of a beautiful woman and the body of\r\na dragon, is plucking the apples and offering them to Adam, who is\r\npreparing to eat one, with evident hesitation and reluctance. But three\r\ndemons, downright hobgoblins, appear as secondary actors in the scene,\r\nwho exercise an influence upon the principals. One is patting Eve\r\non the shoulder, with an air of approval and encouragement, while a\r\nsecond, with wings, is urging on Adam, and apparently laughing at his\r\napprehensions; and a third, in a very ludicrous manner, is preventing\r\nhim from drawing back from the trial.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 43. The Fall of Man._]\r\n\r\nIn all the delineations of demons we have yet seen, the ludicrous is\r\nthe spirit which chiefly predominates, and in no one instance have\r\nwe had a figure which is really demoniacal. The devils are droll but\r\nnot frightful; they provoke laughter, or at least excite a smile,\r\nbut they create no horror. Indeed, they torment their victims so\r\ngood-humouredly, that we hardly feel for them. There is, however, one\r\nwell-known instance in which the mediæval artist has shown himself\r\nfully successful in representing the features of the spirit of evil. On\r\nthe parapet of the external gallery of the cathedral church of Notre\r\nDame in Paris, there is a figure in stone, of the ordinary stature of\r\na man, representing the demon, apparently looking with satisfaction\r\nupon the inhabitants of the city as they were everywhere indulging in\r\nsin and wickedness. We give a sketch of this figure in our cut No. 44.\r\nThe unmixed evil--horrible in its expression in this countenance--is\r\nmarvellously portrayed. It is an absolute Mephistophiles, carrying in\r\nhis features a strange mixture of hateful qualities--malice, pride,\r\nenvy--in fact, all the deadly sins combined in one diabolical whole.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 44. The Spirit of Evil._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  EMPLOYMENT OF ANIMALS IN MEDIÆVAL SATIRE.--POPULARITY OF FABLES;\r\n     ODO DE CIRINGTON.--REYNARD THE FOX.--BURNELLUS AND FAUVEL.--THE\r\n     CHARIVARI.--LE MONDE BESTORNÉ.--ENCAUSTIC TILES.--SHOEING THE\r\n     GOOSE, AND FEEDING PIGS WITH ROSES.--SATIRICAL SIGNS; THE MUSTARD\r\n     MAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of the middle ages appear to have been great admirers\r\nof animals, to have observed closely their various characters and\r\npeculiarities, and to have been fond of domesticating them. They\r\nsoon began to employ their peculiarities as means of satirising and\r\ncaricaturing mankind; and among the literature bequeathed to them by\r\nthe Romans, they received no book more eagerly than the \"Fables of\r\nÆsop,\" and the other collections of fables which were published under\r\nthe empire. We find no traces of fables among the original literature\r\nof the German race; but the tribes who took possession of the Roman\r\nprovinces no sooner became acquainted with the fables of the ancients,\r\nthan they began to imitate them, and stories in which animals acted\r\nthe part of men were multiplied immensely, and became a very important\r\nbranch of mediæval fiction.\r\n\r\nAmong the Teutonic peoples especially, these fables often assumed very\r\ngrotesque forms, and the satire they convey is very amusing. One of the\r\nearliest of these collections of original fables was composed by an\r\nEnglish ecclesiastic named Odo de Cirington, who lived in the time of\r\nHenry II. and Richard I. In Odo's fables, we find the animals figuring\r\nunder the same popular names by which they were afterwards so well\r\nknown, such as Reynard for the Fox, Isengrin for the wolf, Teburg for\r\nthe cat, and the like. Thus the subject of one of them is \"Isengrin\r\nmade Monk\" (_de Isengrino monacho_). \"Once,\" we are told, \"Isengrin\r\ndesired to be a monk. By dint of fervent supplications, he obtained\r\nthe consent of the chapter, and received the tonsure, the cowl, and\r\nthe other insignia of monachism. At length they put him to school,\r\nand he was to learn the 'Paternoster,' but he always replied, 'lamb'\r\n(_agnus_) or 'ram' (_aries_). The monks taught him that he ought to\r\nlook upon the crucifix and upon the sacrament, but he ever directed his\r\neyes to the lambs and rams.\" The fable is droll enough, but the moral,\r\nor application is still more grotesque. \"Such is the conduct of many\r\nof the monks, whose only cry is 'aries,' that is, good wine, and who\r\nhave their eyes always fixed on fat flesh and their platter;\" whence the\r\nsaying in English--\r\n\r\n    _They thou the vulf hore_        _Though thou the hoary wolf_\r\n    _hod to preste,_                 _consecrate to a priest,_\r\n    _they thou him to skole sette_   _though thou put him to school_\r\n    _salmes to lerne,_               _to learn Psalms,_\r\n    _hevere bet hise geres_          _ever are his ears turned_\r\n    _to the grove grene_.            _to the green grove._\r\n\r\nThese lines are in the alliterative verse of the Anglo-Saxons, and\r\nshow that such fables had already found their place in the popular\r\npoetry of the English people. Another of these fables is entitled \"Of\r\nthe Beetle (_serabo_) and his Wife.\" \"A beetle, flying through the\r\nland, passed among most beautiful blooming trees, through orchards\r\nand among roses and lilies, in the most lovely places, and at length\r\nthrew himself upon a dunghill among the dung of horses, and found there\r\nhis wife, who asked him whence he came. And the beetle said, 'I have\r\nflown all round the earth and through it; I have seen the flowers of\r\nalmonds, and lilies, and roses, but I have seen no place so pleasant as\r\nthis,' pointing to the dunghill.\" The application is equally droll with\r\nthe former and equally uncomplimentary to the religious part of the\r\ncommunity. Odo de Cirington tells us that, \"Thus many of the clergy,\r\nmonks, and laymen listen to the lives of the fathers, pass among the\r\nlilies of the virgins, among the roses of the martyrs, and among the\r\nviolets of the confessors, yet nothing ever appears so pleasant and\r\nagreeable as a strumpet, or the tavern, or a singing party, though it\r\nis but a stinking dunghill and congregation of sinners.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 45. The Fox in the Pulpit._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 46. Ecclesiastical Sincerity._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 47. Reynard turned Monk._]\r\n\r\nPopular sculpture and painting were but the translation of popular\r\nliterature, and nothing was more common to represent, in pictures\r\nand carvings, than individual men under the forms of the animals\r\nwho displayed similar characters or similar propensities. Cunning,\r\ntreachery, and intrigue were the prevailing vices of the middle ages,\r\nand they were those also of the fox, who hence became a favourite\r\ncharacter in satire. The victory of craft over force always provoked\r\nmirth. The fabulists, or, we should perhaps rather say, the satirists,\r\nsoon began to extend their canvas and enlarge their picture, and,\r\ninstead of single examples of fraud or injustice, they introduced\r\na variety of characters, not only foxes, but wolves, and sheep,\r\nand bears, with birds also, as the eagle, the cock, and the crow,\r\nand mixed them up together in long narratives, which thus formed\r\ngeneral satires on the vices of contemporary society. In this manner\r\noriginated the celebrated romance of \"Reynard the Fox,\" which in\r\nvarious forms, from the twelfth century to the eighteenth, has enjoyed\r\na popularity which was granted probably to no other book. The plot of\r\nthis remarkable satire turns chiefly on the long struggle between the\r\nbrute force of Isengrin the Wolf, possessed only with a small amount\r\nof intelligence, which is easily deceived--under which character is\r\npresented the powerful feudal baron--and the craftiness of Reynard\r\nthe Fox, who represents the intelligent portion of society, which had\r\nto hold its ground by its wits, and these were continually abused to\r\nevil purposes. Reynard is swayed by a constant impulse to deceive\r\nand victimise everybody, whether friends or enemies, but especially\r\nhis uncle Isengrin. It was somewhat the relationship between the\r\necclesiastical and baronial aristocracy. Reynard was educated in the\r\nschools, and intended for the clerical order; and at different times\r\nhe is represented as acting under the disguise of a priest, of a monk,\r\nof a pilgrim, or even of a prelate of the church. Though frequently\r\nreduced to the greatest straits by the power of Isengrin, Reynard\r\nhas generally the better of it in the end: he robs and defrauds\r\nIsengrin continually, outrages his wife, who is half in alliance\r\nwith him, and draws him into all sorts of dangers and sufferings,\r\nfor which the latter never succeeds in obtaining justice. The old\r\nsculptors and artists appear to have preferred exhibiting Reynard in\r\nhis ecclesiastical disguises, and in these he appears often in the\r\nornamentation of mediæval architectural sculpture, in wood-carvings,\r\nin the illuminations of manuscripts, and in other objects of art. The\r\npopular feeling against the clergy was strong in the middle ages, and\r\nno caricature was received with more favour than those which exposed\r\nthe immorality or dishonesty of a monk or a priest. Our cut No. 45 is\r\ntaken from a sculpture in the church of Christchurch, in Hampshire, for\r\nthe drawing of which I am indebted to my friend, Mr. Llewellynn Jewitt.\r\nIt represents Reynard in the pulpit preaching; behind, or rather\r\nperhaps beside him, a diminutive cock stands upon a stool--in modern\r\ntimes we should be inclined to say he was acting as clerk. Reynard's\r\ncostume consists merely of the ecclesiastical hood or cowl. Such\r\nsubjects are frequently found on the carved seats, or misereres, in the\r\nstalls of the old cathedrals and collegiate churches. The painted glass\r\nof the great window of the north cross-aisle of St. Martin's church in\r\nLeicester, which was destroyed in the last century, represented the\r\nfox, in the character of an ecclesiastic, preaching to a congregation\r\nof geese, and addressing them in the words--_Testis est mihi Deus,\r\nquam cupiam vos omnes visceribus meis_ (God is witness, how I desire\r\nyou all in my bowels), a parody on the words of the New Testament.[25]\r\nOur cut No. 46 is taken from one of the misereres in the church of\r\nSt. Mary, at Beverley, in Yorkshire. Two foxes are represented in the\r\ndisguise of ecclesiastics, each furnished with a pastoral staff, and\r\nthey appear to be receiving instructions from a prelate or personage\r\nof rank--perhaps they are undertaking a pilgrimage of penance. But\r\ntheir sincerity is rendered somewhat doubtful by the geese concealed\r\nin their hoods. In one of the incidents of the romance of Reynard,\r\nthe hero enters a monastery and becomes a monk, in order to escape the\r\nwrath of King Noble, the lion. For some time he made an outward show of\r\nsanctity and self-privation, but unknown to his brethren he secretly\r\nhelped himself freely to the good things of the monastery. One day he\r\nobserved, with longing lips, a messenger who brought four fat capons as\r\na present from a lay neighbour to the abbot. That night, when all the\r\nmonks had retired to rest, Reynard obtained admission to the larder,\r\nregaled himself with one of the capons, and as soon as he had eaten it,\r\ntrussed the three others on his back, escaped secretly from the abbey,\r\nand, throwing away his monastic garment, hurried home with his prey. We\r\nmight almost imagine our cut No. 47, taken from one of the stalls of\r\nthe church of Nantwich, in Cheshire, to have been intended to represent\r\nthis incident, or, at least, a similar one. Our next cut, No. 48, is\r\ntaken from a stall in the church of Boston, in Lincolnshire. A prelate,\r\nequally false, is seated in his chair, with a mitre on his head, and\r\nthe pastoral staff in his right hand. His flock are represented by a\r\ncock and hens, the former of which he holds securely with his right\r\nhand, while he appears to be preaching to them.\r\n\r\n [25] An engraving of this scene, modernised in character, is given in\r\n      Nichols's \"Leicestershire,\" vol. i. plate 43.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 48. The Prelate and his Flock._]\r\n\r\nAnother mediæval sculpture has furnished events for a rather curious\r\nhistory, at the same time that it is a good illustration of our\r\nsubject. Odo de Cirington, the fabulist, tells us how, one day, the\r\nwolf died, and the lion called the animals together to celebrate his\r\nexequies. The hare carried the holy water, hedgehogs bore the candles,\r\nthe goats rang the bells, the moles dug the grave, the foxes carried\r\nthe corpse on the bier. Berengarius, the bear, celebrated mass, the ox\r\nread the gospel, and the ass the epistle. When the mass was concluded,\r\nand Isengrin buried, the animals made a splendid feast out of his\r\ngoods, and wished for such another funeral. Our satirical ecclesiastic\r\nmakes an application of this story which tells little to the credit\r\nof the monks of his time. \"So it frequently happens,\" he says, \"that\r\nwhen some rich man, an extortionist or a usurer, dies, the abbot or\r\nprior of a convent of beasts, _i.e._ of men living like beasts, causes\r\nthem to assemble. For it commonly happens that in a great convent of\r\nblack or white monks (Benedictines or Augustinians) there are none\r\nbut beasts--lions by their pride, foxes by their craftiness, bears by\r\ntheir voracity, stinking goats by their incontinence, asses by their\r\nsluggishness, hedgehogs by their asperity, hares by their timidity,\r\nbecause they were cowardly where there was no fear, and oxen by their\r\nlaborious cultivation of their land.\"[26]\r\n\r\n [26] The Latin text of this and some others of the fables of Odo de\r\n      Cirington will be found in my \"Selection of Latin Stories,\" pp.\r\n      50-52, 55-58, and 80.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 49. The Funeral of the Fox._]\r\n\r\nA scene closely resembling that here described by Odo, differing only\r\nin the distribution of the characters, was translated from some such\r\nwritten story into the pictorial language of the ancient sculptured\r\nornamentation of Strasburg Cathedral, where it formed, apparently,\r\ntwo sides of the capital or entablature of a column near the chancel.\r\nThe deceased in this picture appears to be a fox, which was probably\r\nthe animal intended to be represented in the original, although, in\r\nthe copy of it preserved, it looks more like a squirrel. The bier is\r\ncarried by the goat and the boar, while a little dog underneath is\r\ntaking liberties with the tail of the latter. Immediately before the\r\nbier, the hare carries the lighted taper, preceded by the wolf, who\r\ncarries the cross, and the bear, who holds in one hand the holy-water\r\nvessel and in the other the aspersoir. This forms the first division\r\nof the subject, and is represented in our cut No. 49. In the next\r\ndivision (cut No. 50), the stag is represented celebrating mass, and\r\nthe ass reads the Gospel from a book which the cat supports with its\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 50. The Mass for the Fox._]\r\n\r\nThis curious sculpture is said to have been of the thirteenth century.\r\nIn the fifteenth century it attracted the attention of the reformers,\r\nwho looked upon it as an ancient protest against the corruptions of\r\nthe mass, and one of the more distinguished of them, John Fischart,\r\nhad it copied and engraved on wood, and published it about the year\r\n1580, with some verses of his own, in which it was interpreted as a\r\nsatire upon the papacy. This publication gave such dire offence to the\r\necclesiastical authorities of Strasburg, that the Lutheran bookseller\r\nwho had ventured to publish it, was compelled to make a public apology\r\nin the church, and the wood-engraving and all the impressions were\r\nseized and burnt by the common hangman. A few years later, however, in\r\n1608, another engraving was made, and published in a large folio with\r\nFischart's verses; and it is from the diminished copy of this second\r\nedition--given in Flögel's \"Geschichte des Komisches Literatur\"--that\r\nour cuts are taken. The original Sculpture was still more unfortunate.\r\nIts publication and explanation by Fischart was the cause of no little\r\nscandal among the Catholics, who tried to retort upon their opponents\r\nby asserting that the figures in this funeral celebration were intended\r\nto represent the ignorance of the Protestant preachers; and the\r\nsculpture in the church continued to be regarded by the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities with dissatisfaction until the year 1685, when, to take\r\naway all further ground of scandal, it was entirely defaced.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 51. The Fox Provided._]\r\n\r\nReynard's mediæval celebrity dates certainly from a rather early\r\nperiod. Montflaucon has given an alphabet of ornamental initial\r\nletters, formed chiefly of figures of men and animals, from a\r\nmanuscript which he ascribes to the ninth century, among which is the\r\none copied in our cut No. 51, representing a fox walking upon his hind\r\nlegs, and carrying two small cocks, suspended at the ends of a cross\r\nstaff. It is hardly necessary to say that this group forms the letter\r\nT. Long before this, the Frankish historian Fredegarius, who wrote\r\nabout the middle of the seventh century, introduces a fable in which\r\nthe fox figures at the court of the lion. The same fable is repeated\r\nby a monkish writer of Bavaria, named Fromond, who flourished in the\r\ntenth century, and by another named Aimoinus, who lived about the year\r\n1,000. At length, in the twelfth century, Guibert de Nogent, who died\r\nabout the year 1124, and who has left us his autobiography (_de Vita\r\nsua_), relates an anecdote in that work, in explanation of which he\r\ntells us that the wolf was then popularly designated by the name of\r\nIsengrin; and in the fables of Odo, as we have already seen, this name\r\nis commonly given to the wolf, Reynard to the fox, Teburg to the cat,\r\nand so on with the others. This only shows that in the fables of the\r\ntwelfth century the various animals were known by these names, but it\r\ndoes not prove that what we know as the romance of Reynard existed.\r\nJacob Grimm argued from the derivation and forms of these names, that\r\nthe fables themselves, and the romance, originated with the Teutonic\r\npeoples, and were indigenous to them; but his reasons appear to me to\r\nbe more specious than conclusive, and I certainly lean to the opinion\r\nof my friend Paulin Paris, that the romance of Reynard was native of\r\nFrance,[27] and that it was partly founded upon old Latin legends\r\nperhaps poems. Its character is altogether feudal, and it is strictly\r\na picture of society, in France primarily, and secondly in England and\r\nthe other nations of feudalism, in the twelfth century. The earliest\r\nform in which this romance is known is in the French poem--or rather\r\npoems, for it consists of several branches or continuations--and is\r\nsupposed to date from about the middle of the twelfth century. It soon\r\nbecame so popular, that it appeared in different forms in all the\r\nlanguages of Western Europe, except in England, where there appears\r\nto have existed no edition of the romance of Reynard the Fox until\r\nCaxton printed his prose English version of the story. From that time\r\nit became, if possible, more popular in England than elsewhere, and\r\nthat popularity had hardly diminished down to the commencement of the\r\npresent century.\r\n\r\n [27] See the dissertation by M. Paulin Paris, published in his nice\r\n      popular modern abridgment of the French romance, published in\r\n      1861, under the title \"Les Aventures de Maître Renart et\r\n      d'Ysengrin son compère.\" On the debated question of the origin\r\n      of the Romance, see the learned and able work by Jonckbloet,\r\n      8vo., Groningue, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the story of Reynard caused it to be imitated in a\r\nvariety of shapes, and this form of satire, in which animals acted\r\nthe part of men, became altogether popular. In the latter part of the\r\ntwelfth century, an Anglo-Latin poet, named Nigellus Wireker, composed\r\na very severe satire in elegiac verse, under the title of _Speculum\r\nStultorum_, the \"Mirror of Fools.\" It is not a wise animal like the\r\nfox, but a simple animal, the ass, who, under the name of Brunellus,\r\npasses among the various ranks and classes of society, and notes their\r\ncrimes and vices. A prose introduction to this poem informs us that its\r\nhero is the representative of the monks in general, who were always\r\nlonging for some new acquisition which was inconsistent with their\r\nprofession. In fact, Brunellus is absorbed with the notion that his\r\ntail was too short, and his great ambition is to get it lengthened.\r\nFor this purpose he consults a physician, who, after representing to\r\nhim in vain the folly of his pursuit, gives him a receipt to make\r\nhis tail grow longer, and sends him to the celebrated medical school\r\nof Salerno to obtain the ingredients. After various adventures, in\r\nthe course of which he loses a part of his tail instead of its being\r\nlengthened, Brunellus proceeds to the University of Paris to study and\r\nobtain knowledge; and we are treated with a most amusingly satirical\r\naccount of the condition and manners of the scholars of that time.\r\nSoon convinced of his incapacity for learning, Brunellus abandons the\r\nuniversity in despair, and he resolves to enter one of the monastic\r\norders, the character of all which he passes in review. The greater\r\npart of the poem consists of a very bitter satire on the corruptions of\r\nthe monkish orders and of the Church in general. While still hesitating\r\nwhich order to choose, Brunellus falls into the hands of his old\r\nmaster, from whom he had run away in order to seek his fortune in the\r\nworld, and he is compelled to pass the rest of his days in the same\r\nhumble and servile condition in which he had begun them.\r\n\r\nA more direct imitation of \"Reynard the Fox\" is found in the early\r\nFrench romance of \"Fauvel,\" the hero of which is neither a fox nor\r\nan ass, but a horse. People of all ranks and classes repair to the\r\ncourt of Fauvel, the horse, and furnish abundant matter for satire\r\non the moral, political, and religious hypocrisy which pervaded the\r\nwhole frame of society. At length the hero resolves to marry, and,\r\nin a finely illuminated manuscript of this romance, preserved in the\r\nImperial Library in Paris, this marriage furnishes the subject of a\r\npicture, which gives the only representation I have met with of one of\r\nthe popular burlesque ceremonies which were so common in the middle\r\nages.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 52. A Mediæval Charivari._]\r\n\r\nAmong other such ceremonies, it was customary with the populace, on the\r\noccasion of a man's or woman's second marriage, or an ill-sorted match,\r\nor on the espousals of people who were obnoxious to their neighbours,\r\nto assemble outside the house, and greet them with discordant music.\r\nThis custom is said to have been practised especially in France, and\r\nit was called a _charivari_. There is still a last remnant of it in\r\nour country in the music of marrow-bones and cleavers, with which the\r\nmarriages of butchers are popularly celebrated; but the derivation\r\nof the French name appears not to be known. It occurs in old Latin\r\ndocuments, for it gave rise to such scandalous scenes of riot and\r\nlicentiousness, that the Church did all it could, though in vain, to\r\nsuppress it. The earliest mention of this custom, furnished in the\r\n_Glossarium_ of Ducange, is contained in the synodal statutes of the\r\nchurch of Avignon, passed in the year 1337, from which we learn that\r\nwhen such marriages occurred, people forced their way into the houses\r\nof the married couple, and carried away their goods, which they were\r\nobliged to pay a ransom for before they were returned, and the money\r\nthus raised was spent in getting up what is called in the statute\r\nrelating to it a _Chalvaricum_. It appears from this statute, that\r\nthe individuals who performed the _charivari_ accompanied the happy\r\ncouple to the church, and returned with them to their residence,\r\nwith coarse and indecent gestures and discordant music, and uttering\r\nscurrilous and indecent abuse, and that they ended with feasting.\r\nIn the statutes of Meaux, in 1365, and in those of Hugh, bishop of\r\nBeziers, in 1368, the same practice is forbidden, under the name of\r\n_Charavallium_; and it is mentioned in a document of the year 1372,\r\nalso quoted by Ducange, under that of _Carivarium_, as then existing at\r\nNîmes. Again, in 1445, the Council of Tours made a decree, forbidding,\r\nunder pain of excommunication, \"the insolences, clamours, sounds, and\r\nother tumults practised at second and third nuptials, called by the\r\nvulgar a _Charivarium_, on account of the many and grave evils arising\r\nout of them.\"[28] It will be observed that these early allusions to\r\nthe _charivari_ are found almost solely in documents coming from the\r\nRoman towns in the south of France, so that this practice was probably\r\none of the many popular customs derived directly from the Romans.\r\nWhen Cotgrave's \"Dictionary\" was published (that is, in 1632) the\r\npractice of the _charivari_ appears to have become more general in its\r\nexistence, as well as its application; for he describes it as \"a public\r\ndefamation, or traducing of; a foule noise made, blacke santus rung,\r\nto the shame and disgrace of another; hence an infamous (or infaming)\r\nballad sung, by an armed troupe, under the window of an old dotard,\r\nmarried the day before unto a yong wanton, in mockerie of them both.\"\r\nAnd, again, a _charivaris de poelles_ is explained as \"the carting of\r\nan infamous person, graced with the harmonie of tinging kettles and\r\nfrying-pan musicke.\"[29] The word is now generally used in the sense\r\nof a great tumult of discordant music, produced often by a number of\r\npersons playing different tunes on different instruments at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n [28] \"Insultationes, clamores, sonos, et alios tumultus, in\r\n      secundis et tertiis quorundam nuptiis, quos charivarium vulgo\r\n      appellant, propter multa et gravia incommoda, prohibemus sub pœna\r\n      excommunitationis.\"--Ducange, v. _Charivarium_.\r\n\r\n [29] Cotgrave's Dictionarie, v. _Charivaris_.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 53. Continuation of the Charivari._]\r\n\r\nAs I have stated above, the manuscript of the romance of \"Fauvel\" is in\r\nthe Imperial Library in Paris. A copy of this illumination is engraved\r\nin Jaime's \"Musée de la Caricature,\" from which our cuts Nos. 52 and 53\r\nare taken. It is divided into three compartments, one above another,\r\nin the uppermost of which Fauvel is seen entering the nuptial chamber\r\nto his young wife, who is already in bed. The scene in the compartment\r\nbelow, which is copied in our cut No. 52, represents the street\r\noutside, and the mock revellers performing the _charivari_; and this is\r\ncontinued in the third, or lowest, compartment, which is represented\r\nin our cut No. 53. Down each side of the original illumination is a\r\nframe-work of windows, from which people, who have been disturbed by\r\nthe noise, are looking out upon the tumult. It will be seen that all\r\nthe performers wear masks, and that they are dressed in burlesque\r\ncostume. In confirmation of the statement of the ecclesiastical synods\r\nas to the licentiousness of these exhibitions, we see one of the\r\nperformers here disguised as a woman, who lifts up his dress to expose\r\nhis person while dancing. The musical instruments are no less grotesque\r\nthan the costumes, for they consist chiefly of kitchen utensils, such\r\nas frying-pans, mortars, saucepans, and the like.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 54. The Tables Turned._]\r\n\r\nThere was another series of subjects in which animals were introduced\r\nas the instruments of satire. This satire consisted in reverting\r\nthe position of man with regard to the animals over which he had\r\nbeen accustomed to tyrannise, so that he was subjected to the same\r\ntreatment from the animals which, in his actual position, he uses\r\ntowards them. This change of relative position was called in old French\r\nand Anglo-Norman, _le monde bestorné_, which was equivalent to the\r\nEnglish phrase, \"the world turned upside down.\" It forms the subject\r\nof rather old verses, I believe, both in French and English, and\r\nindividual scenes from it are met with in pictorial representation at\r\na rather early date. During the year 1862, in the course of accidental\r\nexcavations on the site of the Friary, at Derby, a number of encaustic\r\ntiles, such as were used for the floors of the interiors of churches\r\nand large buildings, were found.[30] The ornamentation of these tiles,\r\nespecially of the earlier ones, is, like all mediæval ornamentations,\r\nextremely varied, and even these tiles sometimes present subjects of\r\na burlesque and satirical character, though they are more frequently\r\nadorned with the arms and badges of benefactors to the church or\r\nconvent. The tiles found on the site of the priory at Derby are\r\nbelieved to be of the thirteenth century, and one pattern, a diminished\r\ncopy of which is given in our cut No. 54, presents a subject taken\r\nfrom the _monde bestorné_. The hare, master of his old enemy, the\r\ndog, has become hunter himself, and seated upon the dog's back he\r\nrides vigorously to the chace, blowing his horn as he goes. The design\r\nis spiritedly executed, and its satirical intention is shown by the\r\nmonstrous and mirthful face, with the tongue lolling out, figured on\r\nthe outer corner of the tile. It will be seen that four of these tiles\r\nare intended to be joined together to make the complete piece. In an\r\nillumination in a manuscript of the fourteenth century in the British\r\nMuseum (MS. Reg. 10 E iv.), the hares are taking a still more severe\r\nvengeance on their old enemy. The dog has been caught, brought to trial\r\nfor his numerous murders, and condemned, and they are represented here\r\n(cut No. 55) conducting him in the criminal's cart to the gallows. Our\r\ncut No. 56, the subject of which is furnished by one of the carved\r\nstalls in Sherborne Minster (it is here copied from the engraving\r\nin Carter's \"Specimens of Ancient Sculpture\"), represents another\r\nexecution scene, similar in spirit to the former. The geese have seized\r\ntheir old enemy, Reynard, and are hanging him on a gallows, while two\r\nmonks, who attend the execution, appear to be amused at the energetic\r\nmanner in which the geese perform their task. Mr. Jewitt mentions two\r\nother subjects belonging to this series, one of them taken from an\r\nilluminated manuscript; they are, the mouse chasing the cat, and the\r\nhorse driving the cart--the former human carter in this case taking the\r\nplace of the horse between the shafts.\r\n\r\n [30] Mr. Llewellynn Jewitt, in his excellent publication, the\r\n      _Reliquary_, for October, 1862, has given an interesting paper on\r\n      the encaustic tiles found on this occasion, and on the conventual\r\n      house to which they belonged.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 55. Justice in the Hands of the Persecuted._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 56. Reynard brought to Account at Last._]\r\n\r\n\"The World turned upside down; or, the Folly of Man,\" has continued\r\namongst us to be a popular chap-book and child's book till within a\r\nvery few years, and I have now a copy before me printed in London\r\nabout the year 1790. It consists of a series of rude woodcuts, with a\r\nfew doggrel verses under each. One of these, entitled \"The Ox turned\r\nFarmer,\" represents two men drawing the plough, driven by an ox. In the\r\nnext, a rabbit is seen turning the spit on which a man is roasting,\r\nwhile a cock holds a ladle and bastes. In a third, we see a tournament,\r\nin which the horses are armed and ride upon the men. Another represents\r\nthe ox killing the butcher. In others we have birds netting men and\r\nwomen; the ass, turned miller, employing the man-miller to carry his\r\nsacks; the horse turned groom, and currying the man; and the fishes\r\nangling for men and catching them.\r\n\r\nIn a cleverly sculptured ornament in Beverley Minster, represented\r\nin our cut No. 57, the goose herself is represented in a grotesque\r\nsituation, which might almost give her a place in \"The World turned\r\nupside down,\" although it is a mere burlesque, without any apparent\r\nsatirical aim. The goose has here taken the place of the horse at the\r\nblacksmith's, who is vigorously nailing the shoe on her webbed foot.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 57. Shoeing the Goose._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 58. Food for Swine._]\r\n\r\nBurlesque subjects of this description are not uncommon, especially\r\namong architectural sculpture and wood-carving, and, at a rather\r\nlater period, on all ornamental objects. The field for such subjects\r\nwas so extensive, that the artist had an almost unlimited choice,\r\nand therefore his subjects might be almost infinitely varied, though\r\nwe usually find them running on particular classes. The old popular\r\nproverbs, for instance, furnished a fruitful source for drollery, and\r\nare at times delineated in an amusingly literal or practical manner.\r\nPictorial proverbs and popular sayings are sometimes met with on the\r\ncarved misereres. For example, in one of those at Rouen, in Normandy,\r\nrepresented in our cut No. 58, the carver has intended to represent\r\nthe idea of the old saying, in allusion to misplaced bounty, of\r\nthrowing pearls to swine, and has given it a much more picturesque and\r\npictorially intelligible form, by introducing a rather dashing female\r\nfeeding her swine with roses, or rather offering them roses for food,\r\nfor the swine display no eagerness to feed upon them.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 59. The Industrious Sow._]\r\n\r\nWe meet with such subjects as these scattered over all mediæval\r\nworks of art, and at a somewhat later period they were transferred\r\nto other objects, such as the signs of houses. The custom of placing\r\nsigns over the doors of shops and taverns, was well known to the\r\nancients, as is abundantly manifested by their frequent occurrence\r\nin the ruins of Pompeii; but in the middle ages, the use of signs\r\nand badges was universal, and as--contrary to the apparent practice\r\nin Pompeii, where certain badges were appropriated to certain trades\r\nand professions--every individual was free to choose his own sign,\r\nthe variety was unlimited. Many still had reference, no doubt, to the\r\nparticular calling of those to whom they belonged, while others were of\r\na religious character, and indicated the saint under whose protection\r\nthe householder had placed himself. Some people took animals for their\r\nsigns, others monstrous or burlesque figures; and, in fact, there were\r\nhardly any of the subjects of caricature or burlesque familiar to\r\nthe mediæval sculptor and illuminator which did not from time to time\r\nappear on these popular signs. A few of the old signs still preserved,\r\nespecially in the quaint old towns of France, Germany, and the\r\nNetherlands, show us how frequently they were made the instruments of\r\npopular satire. A sign not uncommon in France was _La Truie qui file_\r\n(the sow spinning). Our cut No. 59 represents this subject as treated\r\non an old sign, a carving in bas-relief of the sixteenth century, on\r\na house in the Rue du Marché-aux-Poirées, in Rouen. The sow appears\r\nhere in the character of the industrious housewife, employing herself\r\nin spinning at the same time that she is attending to the wants of her\r\nchildren. There is a singularly satirical sign at Beauvais, on a house\r\nwhich was formerly occupied by an _épicier-moutardier_, or grocer who\r\nmade mustard, in the Rue du Châtel. In front of this sign, which is\r\nrepresented in our cut No. 60, appears a large mustard-mill, on one\r\nside of which stands Folly with a staff in her hand, with which she\r\nis stirring the mustard, while an ape with a sort of sardonic grin,\r\nthrows in a seasoning, which may be conjectured by his posture.[31] The\r\ntrade-mark of the individual who adopted this strange device, is carved\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n [31] See an interesting little book on this subject by M. Ed. de\r\n      la Quérière, entitled \"Recherches sur les Enseignes des Maisons\r\n      Particulières,\" 8vo., Rouen, 1852, from which both the above\r\n      examples are taken.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 60. Adulteration._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE MONKEY IN BURLESQUE AND CARICATURE.--TOURNAMENTS AND SINGLE\r\n     COMBATS.--MONSTROUS COMBINATIONS OF ANIMAL FORMS.--CARICATURES ON\r\n     COSTUME.--THE HAT.--THE HELMET.--LADIES' HEAD-DRESSES.--THE GOWN,\r\n     AND ITS LONG SLEEVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fox, the wolf, and their companions, were introduced as instruments\r\nof satire, on account of their peculiar characters; but there were\r\nother animals which were also favourites with the satirist, because\r\nthey displayed an innate inclination to imitate; they formed, as it\r\nwere, natural parodies upon mankind. I need hardly say that of these\r\nthe principal and most remarkable was the monkey. This animal must\r\nhave been known to our Anglo-Saxon forefathers from a remote period,\r\nfor they had a word for it in their own language--_apa_, our _ape_.\r\nMonkey is a more modern name, and seems to be equivalent with maniken,\r\nor a little man. The earliest _Bestiaries_, or popular treatises on\r\nnatural history, give anecdotes illustrative of the aptness of this\r\nanimal for imitating the actions of men, and ascribe to it a degree of\r\nunderstanding which would almost raise it above the level of the brute\r\ncreation. Philip de Thaun, an Anglo-Norman poet of the reign of Henry\r\nI., in his _Bestiary_, tells us that \"the monkey, by imitation, as\r\nbooks say, counterfeits what it sees, and mocks people:\"--\r\n\r\n      _Li singe par figure, si cum dit escripture,\r\n      Ceo que il vait contrefait, de gent escar hait._[32]\r\n\r\nHe goes on to inform us, as a proof of the extraordinary instinct of\r\nthis animal, that it has more affection for some of its cubs than for\r\nothers, and that, when running away, it carried those which it liked\r\nbefore it, and those it disliked behind its back. The sketch from the\r\nilluminated manuscript of the Romance of the Comte d'Artois, of the\r\nfifteenth century, which forms our cut No. 61, represents the monkey,\r\ncarrying, of course, its favourite child before it in its flight, and\r\nwhat is more, it is taking that flight mounted on a donkey. A monkey on\r\nhorseback appears not to have been a novelty, as we shall see in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n [32] See my \"Popular Treatises on Science written during the Middle\r\n      Ages,\" p. 107.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 61. A Monkey Mounted._]\r\n\r\nAlexander Neckam, a very celebrated English scholar of the latter part\r\nof the twelfth century, and one of the most interesting of the early\r\nmediæval writers on natural history, gives us many anecdotes, which\r\nshow us how much attached our mediæval forefathers were to domesticated\r\nanimals, and how common a practice it was to keep them in their houses.\r\nThe baronial castle appears often to have presented the appearance\r\nof a menagerie of animals, among which some were of that strong and\r\nferocious character that rendered it necessary to keep them in close\r\nconfinement, while others, such as monkeys, roamed about the buildings\r\nat will. One of Neckam's stories is very curious in regard to our\r\nsubject, for it shows that the people in those days exercised their\r\ntamed animals in practically caricaturing contemporary weaknesses and\r\nfashions. This writer remarks that \"the nature of the ape is so ready\r\nat acting, by ridiculous gesticulations, the representations of things\r\nit has seen, and thus gratifying the vain curiosity of worldly men\r\nin public exhibitions, that it will even dare to imitate a military\r\nconflict. A jougleur (_histrio_) was in the habit of constantly taking\r\ntwo monkeys to the military exercises which are commonly called\r\ntournaments, that the labour of teaching might be diminished by\r\nfrequent inspection. He afterwards taught two dogs to carry these apes,\r\nwho sat on their backs, furnished with proper arms. Nor did they want\r\nspurs, with which they strenuously urged on the dogs. Having broken\r\ntheir lances, they drew out their swords, with which they spent many\r\nblows on each other's shields. Who at this sight could refrain from\r\nlaughter?\"[33]\r\n\r\n [33] Alexander Neckam, De Naturis Rerum, lib. ii. c. 129.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 62. A Tournament._]\r\n\r\nSuch contemporary caricatures of the mediæval tournament, which was\r\nin its greatest fashion during the period from the twelfth to the\r\nfourteenth century, appear to have been extremely popular, and are not\r\nunfrequently represented in the borders of illuminated manuscripts.\r\nThe manuscript now so well known as \"Queen Mary's Psalter\" (MS. Reg.\r\n2 B vii.), and written and illuminated very early in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, contains not a few illustrations of this description. One of\r\nthese, which forms our cut No. 62, represents a tournament not much\r\nunlike that described by Alexander Neckam, except that the monkeys\r\nare here riding upon other monkeys, and not upon dogs. In fact, all\r\nthe individuals here engaged are monkeys, and the parody is completed\r\nby the introduction of the trumpeter on one side, and of minstrelsy,\r\nrepresented by a monkey playing on the tabor, on the other; or,\r\nperhaps, the two monkeys are simply playing on the pipe and tabor,\r\nwhich were looked upon as the lowest description of minstrelsy, and are\r\ntherefore the more aptly introduced into the scene.\r\n\r\nThe same manuscript has furnished us with the cut No. 63. Here the\r\ncombat takes place between a monkey and a stag, the latter having\r\nthe claws of a griffin. They are mounted, too, on rather nondescript\r\nanimals--one having the head and body of a lion, with the forefeet\r\nof an eagle; the other having a head somewhat like that of a lion,\r\non a lion's body, with the hind parts of a bear. This subject may,\r\nperhaps, be intended as a burlesque on the mediæval romances, filled\r\nwith combats between the Christians and the Saracens; for the ape--who,\r\nin the moralisations which accompany the _Bestiaries_, is said to\r\nrepresent the devil--is here armed with what are evidently intended for\r\nthe sabre and shield of a Saracen, while the flag carries the shield\r\nand lance of a Christian knight.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 63. A Feat of Arms._]\r\n\r\nThe love of the mediæval artists for monstrous figures of animals,\r\nand for mixtures of animals and men, has been alluded to in a former\r\nchapter. The combatants in the accompanying cut (No. 64), taken from\r\nthe same manuscript, present a sort of combination of the rider and\r\nthe animal, and they again seem to be intended for a Saracen and a\r\nChristian. The figure to the right, which is composed of the body of\r\na satyr, with the feet of a goose and the wings of a dragon, is armed\r\nwith a similar Saracenic sabre; while that to the left, which is on\r\nthe whole less monstrous, wields a Norman sword. Both have human faces\r\nbelow the navel as well as above, which was a favourite idea in the\r\ngrotesque of the middle ages. Our mediæval forefathers appear to\r\nhave had a decided taste for monstrosities of every description, and\r\nespecially for mixtures of different kinds of animals, and of animals\r\nand men. There is no doubt, to judge by the anecdotes recorded by such\r\nwriters as Giraldus Cambrensis, that a belief in the existence of such\r\nunnatural creatures was widely entertained. In his account of Ireland,\r\nthis writer tells us of animals which were half ox and half man, half\r\nstag and half cow, and half dog and half monkey.[34] It is certain that\r\nthere was a general belief in such animals, and nobody could be more\r\ncredulous than Giraldus himself.\r\n\r\n [34] See Girald. Cambr., Topog. Hiberniæ, dist. ii. cc. 21, 22; and the\r\n      Itinerary of Wales, lib. ii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 64. A Terrible Combat._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 65. Fashionable Dress._]\r\n\r\nThe design to caricature, which is tolerably evident in the subjects\r\njust given, is still more apparent in other grotesques that adorn\r\nthe borders of the mediæval manuscripts, as well as in some of the\r\nmediæval carvings and sculpture. Thus, in our cut No. 65, taken from\r\none of the borders in the Romance of the Comte d'Artois, a manuscript\r\nof the fifteenth century, we cannot fail to recognise an attempt at\r\nturning to ridicule the contemporary fashions in dress. The hat is\r\nonly an exaggerated form of one which appears to have been commonly\r\nused in France in the latter half of the fifteenth century, and which\r\nappears frequently in illuminated manuscripts executed in Burgundy;\r\nand the boot also belongs to the same period. The latter reappeared at\r\ndifferent times, until at length it became developed into the modern\r\ntop-boots. In cut No. 66, from the same manuscript, where it forms the\r\nletter T, we have the same form of hat, still more exaggerated, and\r\ncombined at the same time with grotesque faces.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 66. Heads and Hats._]\r\n\r\nCaricatures on costume are by no means uncommon among the artistic\r\nremains of the middle ages, and are not confined to illuminated\r\nmanuscripts. The fashionable dresses of those days went into far more\r\nridiculous excesses of shape than anything we see in our times--at\r\nleast, so far as we can believe the drawings in the manuscripts;\r\nbut these, however seriously intended, were constantly degenerating\r\ninto caricature, from circumstances which are easily explained, and\r\nwhich have, in fact, been explained already in their influence on\r\nother parts of our subject. The mediæval artists in general were not\r\nvery good delineators of form, and their outlines are much inferior\r\nto their finish. Conscious of this, though perhaps unknowingly,\r\nthey sought to remedy the defect in a spirit which has always been\r\nadopted in the early stages of art-progress--they aimed at making\r\nthemselves understood by giving a special prominence to the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the objects they wished to represent. These were\r\nthe points which naturally attracted people's first attention, and\r\nthe resemblance was felt most by people in general when these points\r\nwere put forward in excessive prominence in the picture. The dresses,\r\nperhaps, hardly existed in the exact forms in which we see them in\r\nthe illuminations, or at least those were only exceptions to the\r\ngenerally more moderate forms; and hence, in using these pictorial\r\nrecords as materials for the history of costume, we ought to make a\r\ncertain allowance for exaggeration--we ought, indeed, to treat them\r\nalmost as caricatures. In fact, much of what we now call caricature,\r\nwas then characteristic of serious art, and of what was considered its\r\nhigh development. Many of the attempts which have been made of late\r\nyears to introduce ancient costume on the stage, would probably be\r\nregarded by the people who lived in the age which they were intended to\r\nrepresent, as a mere design to turn them into ridicule. Nevertheless,\r\nthe fashions in dress were, especially from the twelfth century to the\r\nsixteenth, carried to a great degree of extravagance, and were not only\r\nthe objects of satire and caricature, but drew forth the indignant\r\ndeclamations of the Church, and furnished a continuous theme to the\r\npreachers. The contemporary chronicles abound with bitter reflections\r\non the extravagance in costume, which was considered as one of the\r\noutward signs of the great corruption of particular periods; and they\r\ngive us not unfrequent examples of the coarse manner in which the\r\nclergy discussed them in their sermons. The readers of Chaucer will\r\nremember the manner in which this subject is treated in the \"Parson's\r\nTale.\" In this respect the satirists of the Church went hand in hand\r\nwith the pictorial caricaturists of the illuminated manuscripts,\r\nand of the sculptures with which we sometimes meet in contemporary\r\narchitectural ornamentation. In the latter, this class of caricature is\r\nperhaps less frequent, but it is sometimes very expressive. The very\r\ncurious _misereres_ in the church of Ludlow, in Shropshire, present the\r\ncaricature reproduced in our cut No. 67. It represents an ugly, and, to\r\njudge by the expression of the countenance, an ill-tempered old woman,\r\nwearing the fashionable head-dress of the earlier half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, which seems to have been carried to its greatest extravagance\r\nin the beginning of the reign of Henry VI. It is the style of coiffure\r\nknown especially as the horned head-dress, and the very name carries\r\nwith it a sort of relationship to an individual who was notoriously\r\nhorned--the spirit of evil. This dashing dame of the olden time appears\r\nto have struck terror into two unfortunates who have fallen within\r\nher influence, one of whom, as though he took her for a new Gorgon,\r\nis attempting to cover himself with his buckler, while the other,\r\napprehending danger of another kind, is prepared to defend himself with\r\nhis sword. The details of the head-dress in this figure are interesting\r\nfor the history of costume.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 67. A Fashionable Beauty._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 68. A Man of War._]\r\n\r\nOur next cut, No. 68, is taken from a manuscript in private possession,\r\nwhich is now rather well known among antiquaries by the name of the\r\n\"Luttrell Psalter,\" and which belongs to the fourteenth century. It\r\nseems to involve a satire on the aristocratic order of society--on the\r\nknight who was distinguished by his helmet, his shield, and his armour.\r\nThe individual here represented presents a type which is anything\r\nbut aristocratic. While he holds a helmet in his hand to show the\r\nmeaning of the satire, his own helmet, which he wears on his head, is\r\nsimply a bellows. He may be a knight of the kitchen, or perhaps a mere\r\n_quistron_, or kitchen lad.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 69. A Lady's Head-dress._]\r\n\r\nWe have just seen a caricature of one of the ladies' head-dresses of\r\nthe earlier half of the fifteenth century, and our cut No. 69, from\r\nan illuminated manuscript in the British Museum of the latter half of\r\nthe same century (MS. Harl., No. 4379), furnishes us with a caricature\r\nof a head-dress of a different character, which came into fashion in\r\nthe reign of our Edward IV. The horned head-dress of the previous\r\ngeneration had been entirely laid aside, and the ladies adopted in its\r\nplace a sort of steeple-shaped head-dress, or rather of the form of a\r\nspire, made by rolling a piece of linen into the form of a long cone.\r\nOver this lofty cap was thrown a piece of fine lawn or muslin, which\r\ndescended almost to the ground, and formed, as it were, two wings. A\r\nshort transparent veil was thrown over the face, and reached not quite\r\nto the chin, resembling rather closely the veils in use among our\r\nladies of the present day (1864). The whole head-dress, indeed, has\r\nbeen preserved by the Norman peasantry; for it may be observed that,\r\nduring the feudal ages, the fashions in France and England were always\r\nidentical. These steeple head-dresses greatly provoked the indignation\r\nof the clergy, and zealous preachers attacked them roughly in their\r\nsermons. A French monk, named Thomas Conecte, distinguished himself\r\nespecially in this crusade, and inveighed against the head-dress with\r\nsuch effect, that we are assured that many of the women threw down\r\ntheir head-dresses in the middle of the sermon, and made a bonfire\r\nof them at its conclusion. The zeal of the preacher soon extended\r\nitself to the populace, and, for a while, when ladies appeared in this\r\nhead-dress in public, they were exposed to be pelted by the rabble.\r\nUnder such a double persecution it disappeared for a moment, but when\r\nthe preacher was no longer present, it returned again, and, to use the\r\nwords of the old writer who has preserved this anecdote, \"the women\r\nwho, like snails in a fright, had drawn in their horns, shot them out\r\nagain as soon as the danger was over.\" The caricaturist would hardly\r\noverlook so extravagant a fashion, and accordingly the manuscript in\r\nthe British Museum, just mentioned, furnishes us with the subject of\r\nour cut No. 69. In those times, when the passions were subjected to no\r\nrestraint, the fine ladies indulged in such luxury and licentiousness,\r\nthat the caricaturist has chosen as their fit representative a sow, who\r\nwears the objectionable head-dress in full fashion. The original forms\r\none of the illustrations of a copy of the historian Froissart, and was,\r\ntherefore, executed in France, or, more probably, in Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe sermons and satires against extravagance in costume began at\r\nan early period. The Anglo-Norman ladies, in the earlier part of\r\nthe twelfth century, first brought in vogue in our island this\r\nextravagance in fashion, which quickly fell under the lash of satirist\r\nand caricaturist. It was first exhibited in the robes rather than\r\nin the head-dress. These Anglo-Norman ladies are understood to have\r\nfirst introduced stays, in order to give an artificial appearance of\r\nslenderness to their waists; but the greatest extravagance appeared in\r\nthe forms of their sleeves. The robe, or gown, instead of being loose,\r\nas among the Anglo-Saxons, was laced close round the body, and the\r\nsleeves, which fitted the arm tightly till they reached the elbows,\r\nor sometimes nearly to the wrist, then suddenly became larger, and\r\nhung down to an extravagant length, often trailing on the ground, and\r\nsometimes shortened by means of a knot. The gown, also, was itself\r\nworn very long. The clergy preached against these extravagances in\r\nfashion, and at times, it is said, with effect; and they fell under\r\nthe vigorous lash of the satirist. In a class of satires which became\r\nextremely popular in the twelfth century, and which produced in the\r\nthirteenth the immortal poem of Dante--the visions of purgatory and of\r\nhell--these contemporary extravagances in fashion are held up to public\r\ndetestation, and are made the subject of severe punishment. They were\r\nlooked upon as among the outward forms of pride. It arose, no doubt,\r\nfrom this taste--from the darker shade which spread over men's minds in\r\nthe twelfth century--that demons, instead of animals, were introduced\r\nto personify the evil-doers of the time. Such is the figure (cut No.\r\n70) which we take from a very interesting manuscript in the British\r\nMuseum (MS. Cotton. Nero, C iv.). The demon is here dressed in the\r\nfashionable gown with its long sleeves, of which one appears to have\r\nbeen usually much longer than the other. Both the gown and sleeve are\r\nshortened by means of knots, while the former is brought close round\r\nthe waist by tight lacing. It is a picture of the use of stays made at\r\nthe time of their first introduction.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 70. Sin in Satins._]\r\n\r\nThis superfluity of length in the different parts of the dress was a\r\nsubject of complaint and satire at various and very distant periods,\r\nand contemporary illuminations of a perfectly serious character show\r\nthat these complaints were not without foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  PRESERVATION OF THE CHARACTER OF THE MIMUS AFTER THE FALL OF\r\n     THE EMPIRE.--THE MINSTREL AND JOGELOUR.--HISTORY OF POPULAR\r\n     STORIES.--THE FABLIAUX.--ACCOUNT OF THEM.--THE CONTES DEVOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that, upon the fall of the Roman empire, the\r\npopular institutions of the Romans were more generally preserved to\r\nthe middle ages than those of a higher and more refined character.\r\nThis is understood without difficulty, when we consider that the lower\r\nclass of the population--in the towns, what we might perhaps call the\r\nlower and middle classes--continued to exist much the same as before,\r\nwhile the barbarian conquerors came in and took the place of the ruling\r\nclasses. The drama, which had never much hold upon the love of the\r\nRoman populace, was lost, and the theatres and the amphitheatres, which\r\nhad been supported only by the wealth of the imperial court and of\r\nthe ruling class, were abandoned and fell into ruin; but the _mimus_,\r\nwho furnished mirth to the people, continued to exist, and probably\r\nunderwent no immediate change in his character. It will be well to\r\nstate again the chief characteristics of the ancient _mimus_, before we\r\nproceed to describe his mediæval representative.\r\n\r\nThe grand aim of the _mimus_ was to make people laugh, and he employed\r\ngenerally every means he knew of for effecting this purpose, by\r\nlanguage, by gestures or motions of the body, or by dress. Thus he\r\ncarried, strapped over his loins, a wooden sword, which was called\r\n_gladius histricus_ and _clunaculum_, and wore sometimes a garment\r\nmade of a great number of small pieces of cloth of different colours,\r\nwhich was hence called _centunculus_, or the hundred-patched dress.[35]\r\nThese two characteristics have been preserved in the modern harlequin.\r\nOther peculiarities of costume may conveniently be left undescribed;\r\nthe female mimæ sometimes exhibited themselves unrestricted by dress.\r\nThey danced and sung; repeated jokes and told merry stories; recited\r\nor acted farces and scandalous anecdotes; performed what we now call\r\nmimicry, a word derived from the name of mimus; and they put themselves\r\nin strange postures, and made frightful faces. They sometimes acted\r\nthe part of a fool or zany (_morio_), or of a madman. They added to\r\nthese performances that of the conjurer or juggler (_præstigiator_),\r\nand played tricks of sleight of hand. The mimi performed in the streets\r\nand public places, or in the theatres, and especially at festivals, and\r\nthey were often employed at private parties, to entertain the guests at\r\na supper.\r\n\r\n [35] \"Uti me consuesse tragœdi syrmate, histrionis crotalone ad\r\n      trieterica orgia, aut mimi centunculo.\"--Apuleius, Apolog.\r\n\r\nWe trace the existence of this class of performers during the earlier\r\nperiod of the middle ages by the expressions of hostility towards\r\nthem used from time to time by the ecclesiastical writers, and the\r\ndenunciations of synods and councils, which have been quoted in a\r\nformer chapter.[36] Nevertheless, it is evident from many allusions\r\nto them, that they found their way into the monastic houses, and were\r\nin great favour not only among the monks, but among the nuns also;\r\nthat they were introduced into the religious festivals; and that they\r\nwere tolerated even in the churches. It is probable that they long\r\ncontinued to be known in Italy and the countries near the centre\r\nof Roman influence, and where the Latin language was continued, by\r\ntheir old name of _mimus_. The writers of the mediæval vocabularies\r\nappear all to have been much better acquainted with the meaning of\r\nthis word than of most of the Latin words of the same class, and they\r\nevidently had a class of performers existing in their own times to whom\r\nthey considered that the name applied. The Anglo-Saxon vocabularies\r\ninterpret the Latin _mimus_ by _glig-mon_, a gleeman. In Anglo-Saxon,\r\n_glig_ or _gliu_ meant mirth and game of every description, and as the\r\nAnglo-Saxon teachers who compiled the vocabularies give, as synonyms\r\nof _mimus_, the words _scurra_, _jocista_, and _pantomimus_, it is\r\nevident that all these were included in the character of the gleeman,\r\nand that the latter was quite identical with his Roman type. It was\r\nthe Roman _mimus_ introduced into Saxon England. We have no traces of\r\nthe existence of such a class of performers among the Teutonic race\r\nbefore they became acquainted with the civilisation of imperial Rome.\r\nWe know from drawings in contemporary illuminated manuscripts that the\r\nperformances of the gleeman did include music, singing, and dancing,\r\nand also the tricks of mountebanks and jugglers, such as throwing up\r\nand catching knives and balls, and performing with tamed bears, &c.[37]\r\n\r\n [36] See before, p. 41 of the present volume.\r\n\r\n [37] See examples of these illuminations in my \"History of Domestic\r\n      Manners and Sentiments,\" pp. 34, 35, 37, 65.\r\n\r\nBut even among the peoples who preserved the Latin language, the word\r\n_mimus_ was gradually exchanged for others employed to signify the\r\nsame thing. The word _jocus_ had been used in the signification of a\r\njest, playfulness, _jocari_ signified to jest, and _joculator_ was a\r\nword for a jester; but, in the debasement of the language, _jocus_\r\nwas taken in the signification of everything which created mirth. It\r\nbecame, in the course of time the French word _jeu_, and the Italian\r\n_gioco_, or _giuoco_. People introduced a form of the verb, _jocare_,\r\nwhich became the French _juer_, to play or perform. _Joculator_ was\r\nthen used in the sense of _mimus_. In French the word became _jogléor_,\r\nor _jougléor_, and in its later form _jougleur_. I may remark that, in\r\nmediæval manuscripts, it is almost impossible to distinguish between\r\nthe _u_ and the _n_, and that modern writers have misread this last\r\nword as _jongleur_, and thus introduced into the language a word which\r\nnever existed, and which ought to be abandoned. In old English, as we\r\nsee in Chaucer, the usual form was _jogelere_. The mediæval joculator,\r\nor jougleur, embraced all the attributes of the Roman _mimus_,[38] and\r\nperhaps more. In the first place he was very often a poet himself, and\r\ncomposed the pieces which it was one of his duties to sing or recite.\r\nThese were chiefly songs, or stories, the latter usually told in verse,\r\nand so many of them are preserved in manuscripts that they form a very\r\nnumerous and important class of mediæval literature. The songs were\r\ncommonly satirical and abusive, and they were made use of for purposes\r\nof general or personal vituperation. Out of them, indeed, grew the\r\npolitical songs of a later period. There were female jougleurs, and\r\nboth sexes danced, and, to create mirth among those who encouraged\r\nthem, they practised a variety of performances, such as mimicking\r\npeople, making wry and ugly faces, distorting their bodies into strange\r\npostures, often exposing their persons in a very unbecoming manner, and\r\nperforming many vulgar and indecent acts, which it is not necessary to\r\ndescribe more particularly. They carried about with them for exhibition\r\ntame bears, monkeys, and other animals, taught to perform the actions\r\nof men. As early as the thirteenth century, we find them including\r\namong their other accomplishments that of dancing upon the tight-rope.\r\nFinally, the jougleurs performed tricks of sleight of hand, and were\r\noften conjurers and magicians. As, in modern times, the jougleurs of\r\nthe middle ages gradually passed away, sleight of hand appears to have\r\nbecome their principal accomplishment, and the name only was left in\r\nthe modern word _juggler_. The jougleurs of the middle ages, like\r\nthe mimi of antiquity, wandered about from place to place, and often\r\nfrom country to country, sometimes singly and at others in companies,\r\nexhibited their performances in the roads and streets, repaired to all\r\ngreat festivals, and were employed especially in the baronial hall,\r\nwhere, by their songs, stories, and other performances, they created\r\nmirth after dinner.\r\n\r\n[38] People in the middle ages were so fully conscious of the identity\r\nof the mediæval jougleur with the Roman mimus, that the Latin writers\r\noften use mimus to signify a jougleur, and the one is interpreted by\r\nthe others in the vocabularies. Thus, in Latin-English vocabularies of\r\nthe fifteenth century, we have--\r\n\r\n              _Hic joculator_, }\r\n                               } _Anglice_ jogulour.\r\n              _Hic mimus_,     }\r\n\r\nThis class of society had become known by another name, the origin of\r\nwhich is not so easily explained. The primary meaning of the Latin word\r\n_minister_ was a servant, one who ministers to another, either in his\r\nwants or in his pleasures and amusements. It was applied particularly\r\nto the cup-bearer. In low Latinity, a diminutive of this word was\r\nformed, _minestellus_, or _ministrellus_, a petty servant, or minister.\r\nWhen we first meet with this word, which is not at a very early date,\r\nit is used as perfectly synonymous with _joculator_, and, as the\r\nword is certainly of Latin derivation, it is clear that it was from\r\nit the middle ages derived the French word _menestrel_ (the modern\r\n_ménétrier_), and the English _minstrel_. The mimi or jougleurs were\r\nperhaps considered as the petty ministers to the amusements of their\r\nlord, or of him who for the time employed them. Until the close of the\r\nmiddle ages, the minstrel and the jougleur were absolutely identical.\r\nPossibly the former may have been considered the more courtly of the\r\ntwo names. But in England, as the middle ages disappeared, and lost\r\ntheir influence on society sooner than in France, the word minstrel\r\nremained attached only to the musical part of the functions of the old\r\nmimus, while, as just observed, the juggler took the sleight of hand\r\nand the mountebank tricks. In modern French, except where employed\r\ntechnically by the antiquary, the word _ménétrier_ means a fiddler.\r\n\r\nThe jougleurs, or minstrels, formed a very numerous and important,\r\nthough a low and despised, class of mediæval society. The dulness of\r\nevery-day life in a feudal castle or mansion required something more\r\nthan ordinary excitement in the way of amusement, and the old family\r\nbard, who continually repeated to the Teutonic chief the praises of\r\nhimself and his ancestors, was soon felt to be a wearisome companion.\r\nThe mediæval knights and their ladies wanted to laugh, and to make\r\nthem laugh sufficiently it required that the jokes, or tales, or comic\r\nperformances, should be broad, coarse, and racy, with a good spicing of\r\nviolence and of the wonderful. Hence the jougleur was always welcome\r\nto the feudal mansion, and he seldom went away dissatisfied. But the\r\nsubject of the present chapter is rather the literature of the jougleur\r\nthan his personal history, and, having traced his origin to the Roman\r\nmimus, we will now proceed to one class of his performances.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the mimus and the jougleurs told stories.\r\nOf those of the former, unfortunately, none are preserved, except,\r\nperhaps, in a few anecdotes scattered in the pages of such writers as\r\nApuleius and Lucian, and we are obliged to guess at their character,\r\nbut of the stories of the jougleurs a considerable number has been\r\npreserved. It becomes an interesting question how far these stories\r\nhave been derived from the mimi, handed down traditionally from mimus\r\nto jougleur, how far they are native in our race, or how far they were\r\nderived at a later date from other sources. And in considering this\r\nquestion, we must not forget that the mediæval jougleurs were not the\r\nonly representatives of the mimi, for among the Arabs of the East also\r\nthere had originated from them, modified under different circumstances,\r\na very important class of minstrels and story-tellers, and with these\r\nthe jougleurs of the west were brought into communication at the\r\ncommencement of the crusades. There can be no doubt that a very large\r\nnumber of the stories of the jougleurs were borrowed from the East, for\r\nthe evidence is furnished by the stories themselves; and there can be\r\nlittle doubt also that the jougleurs improved themselves, and underwent\r\nsome modification, by their intercourse with Eastern performers of the\r\nsame class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have traces of the existence of these popular\r\nstories before the jougleurs can have had communication with the East.\r\nThus, as already mentioned, we find, composed in Germany, apparently\r\nin the tenth century, in rhythmical Latin, the well-known story of the\r\nwife of a merchant who bore a child during the long absence of her\r\nhusband, and who excused herself by stating that her pregnancy had been\r\nthe result of swallowing a flake of snow in a snow-storm. This, and\r\nanother of the same kind, were evidently intended to be sung. Another\r\npoem in popular Latin verse, which Grimm and Schmeller, who edited\r\nit,[39] believe may be of the eleventh century, relates a very amusing\r\nstory of an adventurer named Unibos, who, continually caught in his own\r\nsnares, finishes by getting the better of all his enemies, and becoming\r\nrich, by mere ingenious cunning and good fortune. This story is not\r\nmet with among those of the jougleurs, as far as they are yet known,\r\nbut, curiously enough, Lover found it existing orally among the Irish\r\npeasantry, and inserted the Irish story among his \"Legends of Ireland.\"\r\nIt is a curious illustration of the pertinacity with which the popular\r\nstories descend along with peoples through generations from the\r\nremotest ages of antiquity. The same story is found in an oriental form\r\namong the tales of the Tartars published in French by Guenlette.\r\n\r\n [39] In a volume entitled \"Lateinische Gedichte des x. und xi. Jh.\"\r\n      8vo. Göttingen, 1838.\r\n\r\nThe people of the middle ages, who took their word _fable_ from the\r\nLatin _fabula_, which they appear to have understood as a mere term for\r\nany short narration, included under it the stories told by the mimi and\r\njougleurs; but, in the fondness of the middle ages for diminutives, by\r\nwhich they intended to express familiarity and attachment, applied to\r\nthem more particularly the Latin _fabella_, which in the old French\r\nbecame _fablel_, or, more usually, _fabliau_. The fabliaux of the\r\njougleurs form a most important class of the comic literature of the\r\nmiddle ages. They must have been wonderfully numerous, for a very large\r\nquantity of them still remain, and these are only the small portion of\r\nwhat once existed, which have escaped perishing like the others by the\r\naccident of being written in manuscripts which have had the fortune to\r\nsurvive; while manuscripts containing others have no doubt perished,\r\nand it is probable that many were only preserved orally, and never\r\nwritten down at all.[40] The recital of these fabliaux appears to have\r\nbeen the favourite employment of the jougleurs, and they became so\r\npopular that the mediæval preachers turned them into short stories in\r\nLatin prose, and made use of them as illustrations in their sermons.\r\nMany collections of these short Latin stories are found in manuscripts\r\nwhich had served as note-books to the preachers,[41] and out of them\r\nwas originally compiled that celebrated mediæval book called the \"Gesta\r\nRomanorum.\"\r\n\r\n [40] Many of the Fabliaux have been printed, but the two principal\r\n      collections, and to which I shall chiefly refer in the text, are\r\n      those of Barbazan, re-edited and much enlarged by Méon, 4 vols.\r\n      8vo., 1808, and of Méon, 2 vols. 8vo., 1823.\r\n\r\n [41] A collection of these short Latin stories was edited by the author\r\n      of the present work, in a volume printed for the Percy Society in\r\n      1842.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the subjects and language of a large portion\r\nof these fabliaux are such as to make it impossible to present them\r\nbefore modern readers, for they furnish singularly interesting and\r\nminute pictures of mediæval life in all classes of society. Domestic\r\nscenes are among those most frequent, and they represent the interior\r\nof the mediæval household in no favourable point of view. The majority\r\nof these tell loose stories of husbands deceived by their fair spouses,\r\nor of tricks played upon unsuspecting damsels. In some instances the\r\ntreatment of the husband is perhaps what may be called of a less\r\nobjectionable character, as in the fabliau of La Vilain Mire (the\r\nclown doctor), printed in Barbazan (iii. 1), which was the origin of\r\nMolière's well-known comedy of \"Le Médecin malgré lui.\" A rich peasant\r\nmarried the daughter of a poor knight; it was of course a marriage of\r\nambition on his part, and of interest on hers--one of those ill-sorted\r\nmatches which, according to feudal sentiments, could never be happy,\r\nand in which the wife was considered as privileged to treat her husband\r\nwith all possible contempt. In this instance the lady hit upon an\r\ningenious mode of punishing her husband for his want of submission to\r\nher ill-treatment. Messengers from the king passed that way, seeking\r\na skilful doctor to cure the king's daughter of a dangerous malady.\r\nThe lady secretly informed these messengers that her husband was a\r\nphysician of extraordinary talent, but of an eccentric temper, for he\r\nwould never acknowledge or exercise his art until first subjected to\r\na severe beating. The husband is seized, bound, and carried by force\r\nto the king's court, where, of course, he denies all knowledge of the\r\nhealing art, but a severe beating obliges him to compliance, and he is\r\nsuccessful by a combination of impudence and chance. This is only the\r\nbeginning of the poor man's miseries. Instead of being allowed to go\r\nhome, his fame has become so great that he is retained at court for\r\nthe public good, and, with a rapid succession of patients, fearful\r\nof the results of his conscious ignorance, he refuses them all, and\r\nis subjected in every case to the same ill-treatment to force his\r\ncompliance. The examples in which the husband, on the other hand,\r\noutwits the wife are few. A fabliau by a poet who gives himself the\r\nname of Cortebarbe, printed also by Barbazan (iii. 398), relates how\r\nthree blind beggars were deceived by a clerc, or scholar, of Paris, who\r\nmet them on the road near Compiègne. The clerk pretended to give the\r\nthree beggars a bezant, which was then a good sum of money, and they\r\nhastened joyfully to the next tavern, where they ordered a plentiful\r\nsupper, and feasted to their hearts' content. But, in fact, the clerk\r\nhad not given them a bezant at all, although, as he said he did so,\r\nand they could only judge by their hearing, they imagined that they\r\nhad the coin, and each thought that it was in the keeping of one of\r\nhis companions. Thus, when the time of paying came, and the money\r\nwas not forthcoming, in the common belief that one of the three had\r\nreceived the bezant and intended to keep it and cheat the others, they\r\nquarrelled violently, and from abuse soon came to blows. The landlord,\r\ndrawn to the spot by the uproar, and informed of the state of the case,\r\naccused the three blind men of a conspiracy to cheat him, and demanded\r\npayment with great threats. The clerk of Paris, who had followed them\r\nto the inn, and taken his lodging there in order to witness the result,\r\ndelivered the blind men by an equally ingenious trick which he plays\r\nupon the landlord and the priest of the parish.\r\n\r\nSome of these stories have for their subject tricks played among\r\nthieves. In one printed by Méon (i. 124), we have the story of a rich\r\nbut simple villan, or countryman, named Brifaut, who is robbed at\r\nmarket by a cunning sharper, and severely corrected by his wife for\r\nhis carelessness. Robbery, both by force and by sleight of hand and\r\ncraft, prevailed to an extraordinary degree during the middle ages. The\r\nplot of the fabliau of Barat and Haimet, by Jean de Boves (Barbazan,\r\niv. 233), turns upon a trial of skill among three robbers to determine\r\nwho shall commit the cleverest act of thievery, and the result is, at\r\nleast, an extremely amusing story. It may be mentioned as an example\r\nof the numerous stories which the jougleurs certainly obtained from\r\nthe East, that the well-known story of the Hunchback in the \"Arabian\r\nNights\" appears among them in two or three different forms.\r\n\r\nThe social vices of the middle ages, their general licentiousness,\r\nthe prevalence of injustice and extortion, are very fully exposed to\r\nview in these compositions, in which no class of society is spared.\r\nThe villan, or peasant, is always treated very contemptuously; he\r\nformed the class from which the jougleur received least benefit. But\r\nthe aristocracy, the great barons, the lords of the soil, come in for\r\ntheir full share of satire, and they no doubt enjoyed the ridiculous\r\npictures of their own order. I will not venture to introduce the reader\r\nto female life in the baronial castle, as it appears in many of these\r\nstories, and as it is no doubt truly painted, although, of course,\r\nin many instances, much exaggerated. We have already seen how in the\r\nstory of Reynard, the character of mediæval society was represented\r\nby the long struggle between brute force represented by the wolf, the\r\nemblem of the aristocratic class, and the low astuteness of the fox,\r\nor the unaristocratic class. The success of the craft of the human fox\r\nover the force of his lordly antagonist is often told in the fabliaux\r\nin ludicrous colours. In that of Trubert, printed by Méon (i. 192),\r\nthe \"duke\" of a country, with his wife and family, become repeatedly\r\nthe dupes of the gross deceptions of a poor but impudent peasant.\r\nThese satires upon the aristocracy were no doubt greatly enjoyed by\r\nthe good _bourgeoisie_, who, in their turn, furnished abundance of\r\nstories, of the drollest description, to provoke the mirth of the lords\r\nof the soil, between whom and themselves there was a kind of natural\r\nantipathy. Nor are the clergy spared. The priest is usually described\r\nas living with a concubine--his order forbade marrying--and both are\r\nconsidered as fair game to the community; while the monk figures more\r\nfrequently as the hero of gallant adventures. Both priest and monk are\r\nusually distinguished by their selfishness and love of indulgence. In\r\nthe fabliau Du Bouchier d'Abbeville, in Barbazan (iv. 1), a butcher, on\r\nhis way home from the fair, seeks a night's lodging at the house of an\r\ninhospitable priest, who refuses it. But when the former returns, and\r\noffers, in exchange for his hospitality, one of his fat sheep which he\r\nhas purchased at the fair, and not only to kill it for their supper,\r\nbut to give all the meat they do not eat to his host, he is willingly\r\nreceived into the house, and they make an excellent supper. By the\r\npromise of the skin of the sheep, the guest succeeds in seducing both\r\nthe concubine and the maid-servant, and it is only after his departure\r\nthe following morning, in the middle of a domestic uproar caused by\r\nthe conflicting claims of the priest, the concubine, and the maid, to\r\nthe possession of the skin, that it is discovered that the butcher had\r\nstolen the sheep from the priest's own flock.\r\n\r\nThe fabliaux, as remarked before, form the most important class of the\r\nextensive mass of the popular literature of the middle ages, and the\r\nwriters, confident in their strong hold upon public favour, sometimes\r\nturn round and burlesque the literature of other classes, especially\r\nthe long heavy monotony of style of the great romances of chivalry and\r\nthe extravagant adventures they contained, as though conscious that\r\nthey were gradually undermining the popularity of the romance writers.\r\nOne of these poems, entitled \"De Audigier,\" and printed in Barbazan\r\n(iv. 217), is a parody on the romance writers and on their style, not\r\nat all wanting in spirit or wit, but the satire is coarse and vulgar.\r\nAnother printed in Barbazan (iv. 287), under the title \"De Berengier,\"\r\nis a satire upon a sort of knight-errantry which had found its way\r\ninto mediæval chivalry. Berengier was a knight of Lombardy, much given\r\nto boasting, who had a beautiful lady for his wife. He used to leave\r\nher alone in his castle, under pretext of sallying forth in search\r\nof chivalrous adventures, and, after a while, having well hacked his\r\nsword and shield, he returned to vaunt the desperate exploits he had\r\nperformed. But the lady was shrewd as well as handsome, and, having\r\nsome suspicions of his truthfulness as well as of his courage, she\r\ndetermined to make trial of both. One morning, when her husband rode\r\nforth as usual, she hastily disguised herself in a suit of armour,\r\nmounted a good steed, and hurrying round by a different way, met the\r\nboastful knight in the middle of a wood, where he no sooner saw that he\r\nhad to encounter a real assailant, than he displayed the most abject\r\ncowardice, and his opponent exacted from him an ignominious condition\r\nas the price of his escape. On his return home at night, boasting as\r\nusual of his success, he found his lady taking her revenge upon him in\r\na still less respectful manner, but he was silenced by her ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe _trouvères_, or poets, who wrote the fabliaux--I need hardly\r\nremark that _trouvère_ is the same word as _trobador_, but in the\r\nnorthern dialect of the French language--appear to have flourished\r\nchiefly from the close of the twelfth century to the earlier part of\r\nthe fourteenth. They all composed in French, which was a language then\r\ncommon to England and France, but some of their compositions bear\r\ninternal evidence of having been composed in England, and others are\r\nfound in contemporary manuscripts written in this island. The scene of\r\na fabliau, printed by Méon (i. 113), is laid at Colchester; and that\r\nof La Male Honte, printed in Barbazan (iii. 204), is laid in Kent. The\r\nlatter, however, was written by a trouvère named Hugues de Cambrai.\r\nNo objection appears to have been entertained to the recital of these\r\nlicentious stories before the ladies of the castle or of the domestic\r\ncircle, and their general popularity was so great, that the more pious\r\nclergy seem to have thought necessary to find something to take their\r\nplace in the post-prandial society of the monastery, and especially\r\nof the nunnery; and religious stories were written in the same form\r\nand metre as the fabliaux. Some of these have been published under the\r\ntitle of \"Contes Devots,\" and, from their general dulness, it may be\r\ndoubted if they answered their purpose of furnishing amusement so well\r\nas the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  CARICATURES OF DOMESTIC LIFE.--STATE OF DOMESTIC LIFE IN THE MIDDLE\r\n     AGES.--EXAMPLES OF DOMESTIC CARICATURE FROM THE CARVINGS OF THE\r\n     MISERERES.--KITCHEN SCENES.--DOMESTIC BRAWLS.--THE FIGHT FOR\r\n     THE BREECHES.--THE JUDICIAL DUEL BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE AMONG\r\n     THE GERMANS.--ALLUSIONS TO WITCHCRAFT.--SATIRES ON THE TRADES;\r\n     THE BAKER, THE MILLER, THE WINE-PEDLAR AND TAVERN-KEEPER, THE\r\n     ALE-WIFE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of the jougleurs over people's minds generally, with\r\ntheir stories and satirical pieces, their grimaces, their postures,\r\nand their wonderful performances, was very considerable, and may be\r\neasily traced in mediæval manners and sentiments. This influence would\r\nnaturally be exerted upon inventive art, and when a painter had to\r\nadorn the margin of a book, or the sculptor to decorate the ornamental\r\nparts of a building, we might expect the ideas which would first\r\npresent themselves to him to be those suggested by the jougleur's\r\nperformance, for the same taste had to be indulged in the one as in the\r\nother. The same wit or satire would pervade them both.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 71. A Mediæval Kitchen Scene._]\r\n\r\nAmong the most popular subjects of satire during the middle ages, were\r\ndomestic scenes. Domestic life at that period appears to have been in\r\nits general character coarse, turbulent, and, I should say, anything\r\nbut happy. In all its points of view, it presented abundant subjects\r\nfor jest and burlesque. There is little room for doubt that the Romish\r\nChurch, as it existed in the middle ages, was extremely hostile to\r\ndomestic happiness among the middle and lower classes, and that the\r\ninterference of the priest in the family was only a source of domestic\r\ntrouble. The satirical writings of the period, the popular tales,\r\nthe discourses of those who sought reform, even the pictures in the\r\nmanuscripts and the sculptures on the walls invariably represent the\r\nfemale portion of the family as entirely under the influence of the\r\npriests, and that influence as exercised for the worst of purposes.\r\nThey encouraged faithlessness as well as disobedience in wives, and\r\nundermined the virtue of daughters, and were consequently regarded with\r\nanything but kindly feeling by the male portion of the population. The\r\npriest, the wife, and the husband, form the usual leading characters\r\nin a mediæval farce. Subjects of this kind are not very unfrequent in\r\nthe illuminations of manuscripts, and more especially in the sculptures\r\nof buildings, and those chiefly ecclesiastical, in which monks or\r\npriests are introduced in very equivocal situations. This part of the\r\nsubject, however, is one into which we shall not here venture, as we\r\nfind the mediæval caricaturists drawing plenty of materials from the\r\nless vicious shades of contemporary life; and, in fact, some of their\r\nmost amusing pictures are taken from the droll, rather than from the\r\nvicious, scenes of the interior of the household. Such scenes are\r\nvery frequent on the misereres of the old cathedrals and collegiate\r\nchurches. Thus, in the stalls at Worcester Cathedral, there is a droll\r\nfigure of a man seated before a fire in a kitchen well stored with\r\nflitches of bacon, he himself occupied in attending to the boiling pot,\r\nwhile he warms his feet, for which purpose he has taken off his shoes.\r\nIn a similar carving in Hereford Cathedral, a man, also in the kitchen,\r\nis seen attempting to take liberties with the cook maid, who throws a\r\nplatter at his head. A copy of this curious subject is given in cut\r\nNo. 71, and the cut No. 72 is taken from a similar miserere in Minster\r\nChurch, in the Isle of Thanet. It represents an old lady seated,\r\noccupied industriously in spinning, and accompanied by her cats.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 72. An Old Lady and her Friends._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 73. The Lady and her Cat._]\r\n\r\nWe might easily add other examples of similar subjects from the same\r\nsources, such as the scene in our cut No. 73, taken from one of the\r\nstalls of Winchester Cathedral, which seems to be intended to represent\r\na witch riding away upon her cat, an enormous animal, whose jovial\r\nlook is only outdone by that of its mistress. The latter has carried\r\nher distaff with her, and is diligently employed in spinning. A stall\r\nin Sherborne Minster, given in our cut No. 74, represents a scene in a\r\nschool, in which an unfortunate scholar is experiencing punishment of\r\na rather severe description, to the great alarm of his companions, on\r\nwhom his disgrace is evidently acting as a warning. The flogging scene\r\nat school appears to have been rather a favourite subject among the\r\nearly caricaturists, for the scourge was looked upon in the middle ages\r\nas the grand stimulant to scholarship. In those good old times, when a\r\nman recalled to memory his schoolboy days, he did not say, \"When I was\r\nat school,\" but, \"When I was under the rod.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 74. Scholastic Discipline._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 75. A Point in Dispute._]\r\n\r\nAn extensive field for the study of this interesting part of our\r\nsubject will be found in the architectural gallery in the Kensington\r\nMuseum, which contains a large number of calls from stalls and other\r\nsculptures, chiefly selected from the French cathedrals. One of these,\r\nengraved in our cut No. 75, represents a couple of females, seated\r\nbefore the kitchen fire. The date of this sculpture is stated to be\r\n1382. To judge by their looks and attitude, there is a disagreement\r\nbetween them, and the object in dispute seems to be a piece of meat,\r\nwhich one has taken out of the pot and placed on a dish. This lady\r\nwields her ladle as though she were prepared to use it as a weapon,\r\nwhile her opponent is armed with the bellows. The ale-pot was not\r\nunfrequently the subject of pictures of a turbulent character, and\r\namong the grotesque and monstrous figures in the margins of the noble\r\nmanuscript of the fourteenth century, known as the \"Luttrell Psalter,\"\r\none represents two personages not only quarrelling over their pots,\r\nwhich they appear to have emptied, but actually fighting with them. One\r\nof them has literally broken his pot over his companion's head. The\r\nscene is copied in our cut No. 76.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 76. Want of Harmony over the Pot._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 77. Domestic Strife._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 78. A Struggle for the Mastery._]\r\n\r\nIt must be stated, however, that the more common subjects of these\r\nhomely scenes are domestic quarrels, and that the man, or his wife,\r\nenjoying their fireside, or similar bits of domestic comfort, only\r\nmake their appearance at rare intervals. Domestic quarrels and combats\r\nare much more frequent. We have already seen, in the cut No. 75,\r\ntwo dames of the kitchen evidently beginning to quarrel over their\r\ncookery. A stall in the church of Stratford-upon-Avon gives us the\r\ngroup represented in our cut No. 77. The battle has here become\r\ndesperate, but whether the male combatant be an oppressed husband or\r\nan impertinent intruder, is not clear. The quarrel would seem to have\r\narisen during the process of cooking, as the female, who has seized\r\nher opponent by the beard, has evidently snatched up the ladle as\r\nthe readiest weapon at hand. The anger appears to be mainly on her\r\nside, and the rather tame countenance of her antagonist contrasts\r\nstrangely with her inflamed features. Our next cut, No. 78, is taken\r\nfrom the sculpture of a column in Ely Cathedral, here copied from an\r\nengraving in Carter's \"Specimens of Ancient Sculpture.\" A man and\r\nwife, apparently, are struggling for the possession of a staff, which\r\nis perhaps intended to be the emblem of mastery. As is generally\r\nrepresented to be the case in these scenes of domestic strife, the\r\nwoman shows more energy and more strength than her opponent, and she\r\nis evidently overcoming him. The mastery of the wife over the husband\r\nseems to have been a universally acknowledged state of things. A stall\r\nin Sherborne Minster, in Dorset, which has furnished the subject of our\r\ncut No. 79, might almost be taken as the sequel of the last cut. The\r\nlady has possessed herself of the staff, has overthrown her husband,\r\nand is even striking him on the head with it when he is down. In our\r\nnext cut, No. 80, which is taken from one of the casts of stalls in\r\nthe French cathedrals exhibited in the Kensington Museum, it is not\r\nquite clear which of the two is the offender, but, perhaps, in this\r\ncase, the archer, as his profession is indicated by his bow and arrows,\r\nhas made a gallant assault, which, although she does not look much\r\ndispleased at it, the offended dame certainly resists with spirit.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 79. The Wife in the Ascendant._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 80. Violence Resisted._]\r\n\r\nOne idea connected with this picture of domestic antagonism appears\r\nto have been very popular from a rather early period. There is a\r\nproverbial phrase to signify that the wife is master in the household,\r\nby which it is intimated that \"she wears the breeches.\" The phrase\r\nis, it must be confessed, an odd one, and is only half understood by\r\nmodern explanations; but in mediæval story we learn how \"she\" first\r\nput in her claim to wear this particular article of dress, how it was\r\nfirst disputed and contested, how she was at times defeated, but how,\r\nas a general rule, the claim was enforced. There was a French poet of\r\nthe thirteenth century, Hugues Piaucelles, two of whose _fabliaux_, or\r\nmetrical tales, entitled the \"Fabliau d'Estourmi,\" and the \"Fabliau de\r\nSire Hains et de Dame Anieuse,\" are preserved in manuscript, and have\r\nbeen printed in the collection of Barbazan. The second of these relates\r\nsome of the adventures of a mediæval couple, whose household was not\r\nthe best regulated in the world. The name of the heroine of this\r\nstory, Anieuse, is simply an old form of the French word _ennuyeuse_,\r\nand certainly dame Anieuse was sufficiently \"ennuyeuse\" to her lord\r\nand husband. \"Sire Hains,\" her husband, was, it appears, a maker of\r\n\"cottes\" and mantles, and we should judge also, by the point on which\r\nthe quarrel turned, that he was partial to a good dinner. Dame Anieuse\r\nwas of that disagreeable temper, that whenever Sire Hains told her of\r\nsome particularly nice thing which he wished her to buy for his meal,\r\nshe bought instead something which she knew was disagreeable to him.\r\nIf he ordered boiled meat, she invariably roasted it, and further\r\ncontrived that it should be so covered with cinders and ashes that\r\nhe could not eat it. This would show that people in the middle ages\r\n(except, perhaps, professional cooks) were very unapt at roasting meat.\r\nThis state of things had gone on for some time, when one day Sire Hains\r\ngave orders to his wife to buy him fish for his dinner. The disobedient\r\nwife, instead of buying fish, provided nothing for his meal but a dish\r\nof spinage, telling him falsely that all the fish stank. This leads to\r\na violent quarrel, in which, after some fierce wrangling, especially\r\non the part of the lady, Sire Hains proposes to decide their difference\r\nin a novel manner. \"Early in the morning,\" he said, \"I will take off\r\nmy breeches and lay them down in the middle of the court, and the one\r\nwho can win them shall be acknowledged to be master or mistress of the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n      _Le matinet, sans contredire,\r\n      Voudrai mes braies deschaucier,\r\n      Et enmi nostre cort couchier;\r\n      Et qui conquerre les porra,\r\n      Par bone reson mousterra\r\n      Qu'il ert sire ou dame du nostre._\r\n                                 Barbazan, Fabliaux, tome iii. p. 383.\r\n\r\nDame Anieuse accepted the challenge with eagerness, and each prepared\r\nfor the struggle. After due preparation, two neighbours, friend Symon\r\nand Dame Aupais, having been called in as witnesses, and the object\r\nof dispute, the breeches, having been placed on the pavement of the\r\ncourt, the battle began, with some slight parody on the formalities\r\nof the judicial combat. The first blow was given by the dame, who was\r\nso eager for the fray that she struck her husband before he had put\r\nhimself on his guard; and the war of tongues, in which at least Dame\r\nAnieuse had the best of it, went on at the same time as the other\r\nbattle. Sire Hains ventured a slight expostulation on her eagerness\r\nfor the fray, in answer to which she only threw in his teeth a fierce\r\ndefiance to do his worst. Provoked at this, Sire Hains struck at her,\r\nand hit her over the eyebrows, so effectively, that the skin was\r\ndiscoloured; and, over-confident in the effect of this first blow, he\r\nbegan rather too soon to exult over his wife's defeat. But Dame Anieuse\r\nwas less disconcerted than he expected, and recovering quickly from\r\nthe effect of the blow, she turned upon him and struck him on the same\r\npart of his face with such force, that she nearly knocked him over the\r\nsheepfold. Dame Anieuse, in her turn, now sneered over him, and while\r\nhe was recovering from his confusion, her eyes fell upon the object of\r\ncontention, and she rushed to it, and laid her hands upon it to carry\r\nit away. This movement roused Sire Hains, who instantly seized another\r\npart of the article of his dress of which he was thus in danger of\r\nbeing deprived, and began a struggle for possession, in which the said\r\narticle underwent considerable dilapidation, and fragments of it were\r\nscattered over the court. In the midst of this struggle the actual\r\nfight recommenced, by the husband giving his wife so heavy a blow on\r\nthe teeth that her mouth was filled with blood. The effect was such\r\nthat Sire Hains already reckoned on the victory, and proclaimed himself\r\nlord of the breeches.\r\n\r\n          _Hains fiert sa fame enmi les denz\r\n          Tel cop, que la bouche dedenz\r\n          Li a toute emplie de sancz.\r\n          \"Tien ore,\" dist Sire Hains, \"anc,\r\n          Je cuit que je t'ai bien atainte,\r\n          Or t'ai-je de deux colors tainte--\r\n          J'aurai les braies toutes voies.\"_\r\n\r\nBut the immediate effect on Dame Anieuse was only to render her more\r\ndesperate. She quitted her hold on the disputed garment, and fell upon\r\nher husband with such a shower of blows that he hardly knew which way\r\nto turn. She was thus, however, unconsciously exhausting herself, and\r\nSire Hains soon recovered. The battle now became fiercer than ever,\r\nand the lady seemed to be gaining the upper hand, when Sire Hains gave\r\nher a skilful blow in the ribs, which nearly broke one of them, and\r\nconsiderably checked her ardour. Friend Symon here interposed, with\r\nthe praiseworthy aim of restoring peace before further harm might be\r\ndone, but in vain, for the lady was only rendered more obstinate by\r\nher mishap; and he agreed that it was useless to interfere until one\r\nhad got a more decided advantage over the other. The fight therefore\r\nwent on, the two combatants having now seized each other by the hair\r\nof the head, a mode of combat in which the advantages were rather on\r\nthe side of the male. At this moment, one of the judges, Dame Aupais,\r\nsympathising too much with Dame Anieuse, ventured some words of\r\nencouragement, which drew upon her a severe rebuke from her colleague,\r\nSymon, who intimated that if she interfered again there might be two\r\npairs of combatants instead of one. Meanwhile Dame Anieuse was becoming\r\nexhausted, and was evidently getting the worst of the contest, until at\r\nlength, staggering from a vigorous push, she fell back into a large\r\nbasket which lay behind her. Sire Hains stood over her exultingly,\r\nand Symon, as umpire, pronounced him victorious. He thereupon took\r\npossession of the disputed article of raiment, and again invested\r\nhimself with it, while the lady accepted faithfully the conditions\r\nimposed upon her, and we are assured by the poet that she was a good\r\nand obedient wife during the rest of her life. In this story, which\r\naffords a curious picture of mediæval life, we learn the origin of the\r\nproverb relating to the possession and wearing of the breeches. Hugues\r\nPiaucelles concludes his _fabliau_ by recommending every man who has a\r\ndisobedient wife to treat her in the same manner; and mediæval husbands\r\nappear to have followed his advice, without fear of laws against the\r\nill-treatment of women.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 81. The Fight for the Breeches._]\r\n\r\nA subject like this was well fitted for the burlesques on the stalls,\r\nand accordingly we find on one of those in the cathedral at Rouen, the\r\ngroup given in our cut No. 81, which seems to represent the part of the\r\nstory in which both combatants seize hold of the disputed garment, and\r\nstruggle for possession of it. The husband here grasps a knife in his\r\nhand, with which he seems to be threatening to cut it to pieces rather\r\nthan give it up. The _fabliau_ gives the victory to the husband, but\r\nthe wife was generally considered as in a majority of cases carrying\r\noff the prize. In an extremely rare engraving by the Flemish artist\r\nVan Mecken, dated in 1480, of which I give a copy in our cut No. 82.\r\nthe lady, while putting on the breeches, of which she has just become\r\npossessed, shows an inclination to lord it rather tyrannically over her\r\nother half, whom she has condemned to perform the domestic drudgery of\r\nthe mansion.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 82. The Breeches Won._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 83. A Legal Combat._]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, where there was still more roughness in mediæval life, what\r\nwas told in England and France as a good story of domestic doings,\r\nwas actually carried into practice under the authority of the laws.\r\nThe judicial duel was there adopted by the legal authorities as a\r\nmode of settling the differences between husband and wife. Curious\r\nparticulars on this subject are given in an interesting paper entitled\r\n\"Some observations on Judicial Duels as practised in Germany,\"\r\npublished in the twenty-ninth volume of the Archæologia of the Society\r\nof Antiquaries (p. 348). These observations are chiefly taken from\r\na volume of directions, accompanied with drawings, for the various\r\nmodes of attack and defence, compiled by Paulus Kall, a celebrated\r\nteacher of defence at the court of Bavaria about the year 1400. Among\r\nthese drawings we have one representing the mode of combat between\r\nhusband and wife. The only weapon allowed the female, but that a very\r\nformidable one, was, according to these directions, a heavy stone\r\nwrapped up in an elongation of her chemise, while her opponent had only\r\na short staff, and he was placed up to the waist in a pit formed in\r\nthe ground. The following is a literal translation of the directions\r\ngiven in the manuscript, and our cut No. 83 is a copy of the drawing\r\nwhich illustrates it:--\"The woman must be so prepared, that a sleeve\r\nof her chemise extend a small ell beyond her hand, like a little sack;\r\nthere indeed is put a stone weighing three pounds; and she has nothing\r\nelse but her chemise, and that is bound together between the legs with\r\na lace. Then the man makes himself ready in the pit over against his\r\nwife. He is buried therein up to the girdle, and one hand is bound at\r\nthe elbow to the side.\" At this time the practice of such combats in\r\nGermany seems to have been long known, for it is stated that in the\r\nyear 1200 a man and his wife fought under the sanction of the civic\r\nauthorities at Bâle, in Switzerland. In a picture of a combat between\r\nman and wife, from a manuscript resembling that of Paulus Kall, but\r\nexecuted nearly a century later, the man is placed in a tub instead\r\nof a pit, with his left arm tied to his side as before, and his right\r\nholding a short heavy staff; while the woman is dressed, and not\r\nstripped to the chemise, as in the former case. The man appears to be\r\nholding the stick in such a manner that the sling in which the stone\r\nwas contained would twist round it, and the woman would thus be at\r\nthe mercy of her opponent. In an ancient manuscript on the science of\r\ndefence in the library at Gotha, the man in the tub is represented as\r\nthe conqueror of his wife, having thus dragged her head-foremost into\r\nthe tub, where she appears with her legs kicking up in the air.\r\n\r\nThis was the orthodox mode of combat between man and wife, but it was\r\nsometimes practised under more sanguinary forms. In one picture given\r\nfrom these old books on the science of defence by the writer of the\r\npaper on the subject in the Archæologia, the two combatants, naked\r\ndown to the waist, are represented fighting with sharp knives, and\r\ninflicting upon each other's bodies frightful gashes.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 84. The Witch and the Demon._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 85. The Witch and her Victim._]\r\n\r\nA series of stall carvings at Corbeil, near Paris, of which more will\r\nbe said a little farther on in this chapter, has furnished the curious\r\ngroup represented in our cut No. 84, which is one of the rather rare\r\npictorial allusions to the subject of witchcraft. It represents a\r\nwoman who must, by her occupation, be a witch, for she has so far got\r\nthe mastery of the demon that she is sawing off his head with a very\r\nuncomfortable looking instrument. Another story of witchcraft is told\r\nin the sculpture of a stone panel at the entrance of the cathedral of\r\nLyons, which is represented in our cut No. 85. One power, supposed to\r\nbe possessed by witches, was that of transforming people to animals at\r\nwill. William of Malmesbury, in his Chronicle, tells a story of two\r\nwitches in the neighbourhood of Rome, who used to allure travellers\r\ninto their cottage, and there transform them into horses, pigs, or\r\nother animals, which they sold, and feasted themselves with the money.\r\nOne day a young man, who lived by the profession of a jougleur, sought\r\na night's lodging at their cottage, and was received, but they turned\r\nhim into an ass, and, as he retained his understanding and his power of\r\nacting, they gained much money by exhibiting him. At length a rich man\r\nof the neighbourhood, who wanted him for his private amusement, offered\r\nthe two women a large sum for him, which they accepted, but they warned\r\nthe new possessor of the ass that he should carefully restrain him\r\nfrom going into the water, as that would deprive him of his power of\r\nperforming. The man who had purchased the ass acted upon this advice,\r\nand carefully kept him from water, but one day, through the negligence\r\nof his keeper, the ass escaped from his stable, and, rushing to a pond\r\nat no great distance, threw himself into it. Water--and running water\r\nespecially--was believed to destroy the power of witchcraft or magic;\r\nand no sooner was the ass immersed in the water, than he recovered his\r\noriginal form of a young man. He told his story, which soon reached the\r\nears of the pope, and the two women were seized, and confessed their\r\ncrimes. The carving from Lyons Cathedral appears to represent some such\r\nscene of sorcery. The naked woman, evidently a witch, is, perhaps,\r\nseated on a man whom she has transformed into a goat, and she seems to\r\nbe whirling the cat over him in such a manner that it may tear his face\r\nwith its claws.\r\n\r\nThere was still another class of subjects for satire and caricature\r\nwhich belongs to this part of our subject--I mean that of the trader\r\nand manufacturer. We must not suppose that fraudulent trading, that\r\ndeceptive and imperfect workmanship, that adulteration of everything\r\nthat could be adulterated, are peculiar to modern times. On the\r\ncontrary, there was no period in the world's history in which dishonest\r\ndealing was carried on to such an extraordinary extent, in which there\r\nwas so much deception used in manufactures, or in which adulteration\r\nwas practised on so shameless a scale, as during the middle ages. These\r\nvices, or, as we may, perhaps, more properly describe them, these\r\ncrimes, are often mentioned in the mediæval writers, but they were\r\nnot easily represented pictorially, and therefore we rarely meet with\r\ndirect allusions to them, either in sculpture, on stone or wood, or\r\nin the paintings of illuminated manuscripts. Representations of the\r\ntrades themselves are not so rare, and are sometimes droll and almost\r\nburlesque. A curious series of such representations of arts and trades\r\nwas carved on the _misereres_ of the church of St. Spire, at Corbeil,\r\nnear Paris, which only exist now in Millin's engravings, but they seem\r\nto have been works of the fifteenth century. Among them the first\r\nplace is given to the various occupations necessary for the production\r\nof bread, that article so important to the support of life. Thus we\r\nsee, in these carvings at Corbeil, the labours of the reaper, cutting\r\nthe wheat and forming it into sheaves, the miller carrying it away to\r\nbe ground into meal, and the baker thrusting it into the oven, and\r\ndrawing it out in the shape of loaves. Our cut No. 86, taken from one\r\nof these sculptures, represents the baker either putting in or taking\r\nout the bread with his peel; by the earnest manner in which he looks at\r\nit, we may suppose that it is the latter, and that he is ascertaining\r\nif it be sufficiently baked. We have an earlier representation of a\r\nmediæval oven in our cut No. 87, taken from the celebrated illuminated\r\nmanuscript of the \"Romance of Alexandre,\" in the Bodleian Library at\r\nOxford, which appears to belong to an early period of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. Here the baker is evidently going to take a loaf out of the\r\noven, for his companion holds a dish for the purpose of receiving it.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 86. A Baker of the Fifteenth Century._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 87. A Mediæval Baker._]\r\n\r\nIn nothing was fraud and adulteration practised to so great an\r\nextent as in the important article of bread, and the two occupations\r\nespecially employed in making it were objects of very great dislike and\r\nof scornful satire. The miller was proverbially a thief. Every reader\r\nof Chaucer will remember his character so admirably drawn in that of\r\nthe miller of Trumpington, who, though he was as proud and gay \"as eny\r\npecok,\" was nevertheless eminently dishonest.\r\n\r\n  _A theef he was for soth of corn and mele,\r\n  And that a sleigh_ (sly), _and usyng_ (practised) _for to stele_.\r\n                                                  Chaucer's Reeves Tale.\r\n\r\nThis practice included a large college then existing in Cambridge,\r\nbut now forgotten, the Soler Hall, which suffered greatly by his\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\n          _And on a day it happed in a stounde,\r\n          Syk lay the mauncyple on a maledye,\r\n          Men wenden wisly that he schulde dye;\r\n          For which this meller stal bothe mele and corn\r\n          A thousend part more than byforn.\r\n          For ther biforn he stal but curteysly;\r\n          But now he is a theef outrageously.\r\n          For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare,\r\n          But therof sette the meller not a tare;\r\n          He crakked boost, and swor it was nat so._\r\n\r\nTwo of the scholars of this college resolved to go with the corn to the\r\nmill, and by their watchfulness prevent his depredations. Those who are\r\nacquainted with the story know how the scholars succeeded, or rather\r\nhow they failed; how the miller stole half a bushel of their flour and\r\ncaused his wife to make a cake of it; and how the victims had their\r\nrevenge and recovered the cake.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the baker had in these good old times no better\r\ncharacter than the miller, if not worse. There was an old saying, that\r\nif three persons of three obnoxious professions were put together in a\r\nsack and shaken up, the first who came out would certainly be a rogue,\r\nand one of these was a baker. Moreover, the opinion concerning the\r\nbaker was so strong that, as in the phrase taken from the old legends\r\nof the witches, who in their festivals sat thirteen at a table, this\r\nnumber was popularly called a devil's dozen, and was believed to be\r\nunlucky--so, when the devil's name was abandoned, perhaps for the\r\nsake of euphony, the name substituted for it was that of the baker,\r\nand the number thirteen was called \"a baker's dozen.\" The makers of\r\nnearly all sorts of provisions for sale were, in the middle ages,\r\ntainted with the same vice, and there was nothing from which society in\r\ngeneral, especially in the towns where few made bread for themselves,\r\nsuffered so much. This evil is alluded to more than once in that\r\ncurious educational treatise, the \"Dictionarius\" of John de Garlande,\r\nprinted in my \"Volume of Vocabularies.\" This writer, who wrote in the\r\nearlier half of the thirteenth century, insinuates that the makers\r\nof pies (_pastillarii_), an article of food which was greatly in\r\nrepute during the middle ages, often made use of bad eggs. The cooks,\r\nhe says further, sold, especially in Paris to the scholars of the\r\nuniversity, cooked meats, sausages, and such things, which were not\r\nfit to eat; while the butchers furnished the meat of animals which had\r\ndied of disease. Even the spices and drugs sold by the apothecaries,\r\nor _épiciers_, were not, he says, to be trusted. John de Garlande\r\nhad evidently an inclination to satire, and he gives way to it not\r\nunfrequently in the little book of which I am speaking. He says that\r\nthe glovers of Paris cheated the scholars of the university, by selling\r\nthem gloves made of bad materials; that the women who gained their\r\nliving by winding thread (_devacuatrices_, in the Latin of the time),\r\nnot only emptied the scholars' purses, but wasted their bodies also (it\r\nis intended as a pun upon the Latin word); and the hucksters sold them\r\nunripe fruit for ripe. The drapers, he says, cheated people not only\r\nby selling bad materials, but by measuring them with false measures;\r\nwhile the hawkers, who went about from house to house, robbed as well\r\nas cheated.\r\n\r\nM. Jubinal has published in his curious volume entitled \"Jongleurs et\r\nTrouvères,\" a rather jocular poem on the bakers, written in French\r\nof, perhaps, the thirteenth century, in which their art is lauded as\r\nmuch better and more useful than that of the goldsmith's. The millers'\r\ndepredations on the corn sent to be ground at the mill, are laid to the\r\ncharge of the rats, which attack it by night, and the hens, which find\r\ntheir way to it by day; and he explains the diminution the bakings\r\nexperienced in the hands of the baker as arising out of the charity of\r\nthe latter towards the poor and needy, to whom they gave the meal and\r\npaste before it had even been put into the oven. The celebrated English\r\npoet, John Lydgate, in a short poem preserved in a manuscript in the\r\nHarleian Library in the British Museum (MS. Harl. No. 2,255, fol. 157,\r\nv^o), describes the pillory, which he calls their Bastile, as the\r\nproper heritage of the miller and the baker:--\r\n\r\n      _Put out his hed, lyst nat for to dare,\r\n        But lyk a man upon that tour to abyde,\r\n      For cast of eggys wil not oonys spare,\r\n        Tyl he be quallyd body, bak, and syde.\r\n        His heed endooryd, and of verray pryde\r\n      Put out his armys, shewith abrood his face;\r\n        The fenestrallys be made for hym so wyde,\r\n      Claymyth to been a capteyn of that place._\r\n\r\n      _The bastyle longith of verray dewe ryght\r\n        To fals bakerys, it is trewe herytage\r\n      Severalle to them, this knoweth every wyght,\r\n        Be kynde assygned for ther sittyng stage;\r\n        Wheer they may freely shewe out ther visage,\r\n      Whan they tak oonys their possessioun,\r\n        Owthir in youthe or in myddyl age;\r\n      Men doon hem wrong yif they take hym down._\r\n\r\n      _Let mellerys and bakerys gadre hem a gilde,\r\n        And alle of assent make a fraternité,\r\n      Undir the pillory a letil chapelle bylde,\r\n        The place amorteyse, and purchase lyberté,\r\n        For alle thos that of ther noumbre be;\r\n      What evir it coost afftir that they wende,\r\n        They may clayme, be just auctorité,\r\n      Upon that bastile to make an ende._\r\n\r\nThe wine-dealer and the publican formed another class in mediæval\r\nsociety who lived by fraud and dishonesty, and were the objects of\r\nsatire. The latter gave both bad wine and bad measure, and he often\r\nalso acted as a pawnbroker, and when people had drunk more than they\r\ncould pay for, he would take their clothes as pledges for their money.\r\nThe tavern, in the middle ages, was the resort of very miscellaneous\r\ncompany; gamblers and loose women were always on the watch there to\r\nlead more honest people into ruin, and the tavern-keeper profited\r\nlargely by their gains; and the more vulgar minstrel and \"jogelour\"\r\nfound employment there; for the middle classes of society, and even\r\ntheir betters, frequented the tavern much more generally than at the\r\npresent day. In the carved stalls of the church of Corbeil, the liquor\r\nmerchant is represented by the figure of a man wheeling a hogshead\r\nin a barrow, as shown in our cut No. 88. The graveness and air of\r\nimportance with which he regards it would lead us to suppose that the\r\nbarrel contains wine; and the cup and jug on the shelf above show that\r\nit was to be sold retail. The wine-sellers called out their wines\r\nfrom their doors, and boasted of their qualities, in order to tempt\r\npeople in; and John de Garlande assures us that when they entered,\r\nthey were served with wine which was not worth drinking. \"The criers\r\nof wine,\" he says, \"proclaim with extended throat the diluted wine\r\nthey have in their taverns, offering it at four pennies, at six, at\r\neight, and at twelve, fresh poured out from the gallon cask into the\r\ncup, to tempt people.\" (\"Volume of Vocabularies,\" p. 126.) The ale-wife\r\nwas an especial subject of jest and satire, and is not unfrequently\r\nrepresented on the pictorial monuments of our forefathers. Our cut No.\r\n89 is taken from one of the misereres in the church of Wellingborough,\r\nin Northamptonshire; the ale-wife is pouring her liquor from her jug\r\ninto a cup to serve a rustic, who appears to be waiting for it with\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 88. The Wine Dealer._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 89. The Ale-Wife._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 90. The Ale-Drawer._]\r\n\r\nThe figure of the ale-drawer, No. 90, is taken from one of the\r\nmisereres in the parish church of Ludlow, in Shropshire. The size\r\nof his jug is somewhat disproportionate to that of the barrel from\r\nwhich he obtains the ale. The same misereres of Ludlow Church furnish\r\nthe next scene, cut No. 91, which represents the end of the wicked\r\nale-wife. The day of judgment is supposed to have arrived, and she has\r\nreceived her sentence. A demon, seated on one side, is reading a list\r\nof the crimes she has committed, which the magnitude of the parchment\r\nshows to be a rather copious one. Another demon (whose head has been\r\nbroken off in the original) carries on his back, in a very irreverent\r\nmanner, the unfortunate lady, in order to throw her into hell-mouth, on\r\nthe other side of the picture. She is naked with the exception of the\r\nfashionable head-gear, which formed one of her vanities in the world,\r\nand she carries with her the false measure with which she cheated her\r\ncustomers. A demon bagpiper welcomes her on her arrival. The scene is\r\nfull of wit and humour.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 91. The Ale-Wife's End._]\r\n\r\nThe rustic classes, and instances of their rusticity, are not\r\nunfrequently met with in these interesting carvings. The stalls of\r\nCorbeil present several agricultural scenes. Our cut No. 92 is taken\r\nfrom those of Gloucester cathedral, of an earlier date, and represents\r\nthe three shepherds, astonished at the appearance of the star which\r\nannounced the birth of the Saviour of mankind. Like the three kings,\r\nthe shepherds to whom this revelation was made were always in the\r\nmiddle ages represented as three in number. In our drawing from the\r\nmiserere in Gloucester cathedral, the costume of the shepherds is\r\nremarkably well depicted, even to the details, with the various\r\nimplements appertaining to their profession, most of which are\r\nsuspended to their girdles. They are drawn with much spirit, and even\r\nthe dog is well represented as an especially active partaker in the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 92. The Shepherds of the East._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 93. The Carpenter._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 94. The Shoemaker._]\r\n\r\nOf the two other examples we select from the misereres of Corbeil, the\r\nfirst represents the carpenter, or, as he was commonly called by our\r\nAnglo-Saxon and mediæval forefathers, the _wright_, which signifies\r\nsimply the \"maker.\" The application of this higher and more general\r\nterm--for the Almighty himself is called, in the Anglo-Saxon poetry,\r\n_ealra gescefta wyrhta_, the Maker, or Creator, of all things--shows\r\nhow important an art that of the carpenter was considered in the\r\nmiddle ages. Everything made of wood came within his province. In the\r\nAnglo-Saxon \"Colloquy\" of archbishop Alfric, where some of the more\r\nuseful artisans are introduced disputing about the relative value of\r\ntheir several crafts, the \"wright\" says, \"Who of you can do without\r\nmy craft, since I make houses and all sorts of vessels (_vasa_), and\r\nships for you all?\" (\"Volume of Vocabularies,\" p. 11.) And John de\r\nGarlande, in the thirteenth century, describes the carpenter as making,\r\namong other things, tubs, and barrels, and wine-cades. The workmanship\r\nof those times was exercised, before all other materials, on wood\r\nand metals, and the wright, or worker in the former material, was\r\ndistinguished by this circumstance from the smith, or worker in metal.\r\nThe carpenter is still called a wright in Scotland. Our last cut (No.\r\n94), taken also from one of the misereres at Corbeil, represents the\r\nshoemaker, or as he was then usually called, the cordwainer, because\r\nthe leather which he chiefly used came from Cordova in Spain, and was\r\nthence called _cordewan_, or _cordewaine_. Our shoemaker is engaged\r\nin cutting a skin of leather with an instrument of a rather singular\r\nform. Shoes, and perhaps forms for making shoes, are suspended on pegs\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  GROTESQUE FACES AND FIGURES.--PREVALENCE OF THE TASTE FOR UGLY\r\n     AND GROTESQUE FACES.--SOME OF THE POPULAR FORMS DERIVED\r\n     FROM ANTIQUITY; THE TONGUE LOLLING OUT, AND THE DISTORTED\r\n     MOUTH.--HORRIBLE SUBJECTS: THE MAN AND THE SERPENTS.--ALLEGORICAL\r\n     FIGURES: GLUTTONY AND LUXURY.--OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OF\r\n     CLERICAL GLUTTONY AND DRUNKENNESS.--GROTESQUE FIGURES OF\r\n     INDIVIDUALS, AND GROTESQUE GROUPS.--ORNAMENTS OF THE BORDERS OF\r\n     BOOKS.--UNINTENTIONAL CARICATURE; THE MOTE AND THE BEAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grimaces and strange postures of the jougleurs seem to have had\r\ngreat attractions for those who witnessed them. To unrefined and\r\nuneducated minds no object conveys so perfect a notion of mirth as an\r\nugly and distorted face. Hence it is that among the common peasantry\r\nat a country fair few exhibitions are more satisfactory than that of\r\ngrinning through a horse-collar. This sentiment is largely exemplified\r\nin the sculpture especially of the middle ages, a long period,\r\nduring which the general character of society presented that want\r\nof refinement which we now observe chiefly in its least cultivated\r\nclasses. Among the most common decorations of our ancient churches and\r\nother mediæval buildings, are grotesque and monstrous heads and faces.\r\nAntiquity, which lent us the types of many of these monstrosities,\r\nsaw in her Typhons and Gorgons a signification beyond the surface of\r\nthe picture, and her grotesque masks had a general meaning, and were\r\nin a manner typical of the whole field of comic literature. The mask\r\nwas less an individual grotesque to be laughed at for itself, than\r\na personification of comedy. In the middle ages, on the contrary,\r\nalthough in some cases certain forms were often regarded as typical\r\nof certain ideas, in general the design extended no farther than the\r\nforms which the artist had given to it; the grotesque features, like\r\nthe grinning through the horse-collar, gave satisfaction by their mere\r\nugliness. Even the applications, when such figures were intended to\r\nhave one, were coarsely satirical, without any intellectuality, and,\r\nwhere they had a meaning beyond the plain text of the sculpture or\r\ndrawing, it was not far-fetched, but plain and easily understood. When\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon drew the face of a bloated and disfigured monk, he no\r\ndoubt intended thereby to proclaim the popular notion of the general\r\ncharacter of monastic life, but this was a design which nobody could\r\nmisunderstand, an interpretation which everybody was prepared to give\r\nto it. We have already seen various examples of this description of\r\nsatire, scattered here and there among the immense mass of grotesque\r\nsculpture which has no such meaning. A great proportion, indeed, of\r\nthese grotesque sculptures appears to present mere variations of a\r\ncertain number of distinct types which had been handed down from a\r\nremote period, some of them borrowed, perhaps involuntarily, from\r\nantiquity. Hence we naturally look for the earlier and more curious\r\nexamples of this class of art to Italy and the south of France, where\r\nthe transition from classical to mediæval was more gradual, and the\r\ncontinued influence of classical forms is more easily traced. The\r\nearly Christian masons appear to have caricatured under the form of\r\nsuch grotesques the personages of the heathen mythology, and to this\r\npractice we perhaps owe some of the types of the mediæval monsters.\r\nWe have seen in a former chapter a grotesque from the church of Monte\r\nMajour, near Nismes, the original type of which had evidently been some\r\nburlesque figure of Saturn eating one of his children. The classical\r\nmask doubtless furnished the type for those figures, so common in\r\nmediæval sculpture, of faces with disproportionately large mouths; just\r\nas another favourite class of grotesque faces, those with distended\r\nmouths and tongues lolling out, were taken originally from the Typhons\r\nand Gorgons of the ancients. Many other popular types of faces rendered\r\nartificially ugly are mere exaggerations of the distortions produced on\r\nthe features by different operations, such, for instance, as that of\r\nblowing a horn.\r\n\r\nThe practice of blowing the horn, is, indeed, peculiarly calculated\r\nto exhibit the features of the face to disadvantage, and was not\r\noverlooked by the designers of the mediæval decorative sculpture. One\r\nof the large collection of casts of sculptures from French cathedrals\r\nexhibited in the museum at South Kensington, has furnished the two\r\nsubjects given in our cut No. 95. The first is represented as blowing\r\na horn, but he is producing the greatest possible distortion in his\r\nfeatures, and especially in his mouth, by drawing the horn forcibly\r\non one side with his left hand, while he pulls his beard in the other\r\ndirection with the right hand. The force with which he is supposed to\r\nbe blowing is perhaps represented by the form given to his eyes. The\r\nface of the lower figure is in at least comparative repose. The design\r\nof representing general distortion in the first is further shown by the\r\nridiculously unnatural position of the arms. Such distortion of the\r\nmembers was not unfrequently introduced to heighten the effect of the\r\ngrimace in the face; and, as in these examples, it was not uncommon to\r\nintroduce as a further element of grotesque, the bodies, or parts of\r\nthe bodies, of animals, or even of demons.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 95. Grotesque Monsters._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 96. Diabolical Mirth._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 97. Making Faces._]\r\n\r\nAnother cast in the Kensington Museum is the subject of our cut No.\r\n96, which presents the same idea of stretching the mouth. The subject\r\nis here exhibited by another rather mirthful looking individual, but\r\nwhether the exhibitor is intended to be a goblin or demon, or whether\r\nhe is merely furnished with the wings and claws of a bat, seems rather\r\nuncertain. The bat was looked upon as an unpropitious if not an unholy\r\nanimal; like the owl, it was the companion of the witches, and of the\r\nspirits of darkness. The group in our cut No. 97 is taken from one of\r\nthe carved stalls in the church of Stratford-upon-Avon, and represents\r\na trio of grimacers. The first of these three grotesque faces is\r\nlolling out the tongue to an extravagant length; the second is simply\r\ngrinning; while the third has taken a sausage between his teeth to\r\nrender his grimace still more ridiculous. The number and variety of\r\nsuch grotesque faces, which we find scattered over the architectural\r\ndecoration of our old ecclesiastical buildings, are so great that I\r\nwill not attempt to give any more particular classification of them.\r\nAll this church decoration was calculated especially to produce its\r\neffect upon the middle and lower classes, and mediæval art was, perhaps\r\nmore than anything else, suited to mediæval society, for it belonged to\r\nthe mass and not to the individual. The man who could enjoy a match at\r\ngrinning through horse-collars, must have been charmed by the grotesque\r\nworks of the mediæval stone sculptor and wood carver; and we may add\r\nthat these display, though often rather rude, a very high degree of\r\nskill in art, a great power of producing striking imagery.\r\n\r\nThese mediæval artists loved also to produce horrible objects as well\r\nas laughable ones, though even in their horrors they were continually\r\nrunning into the grotesque. Among the adjuncts to these sculptured\r\nfigures, we sometimes meet with instruments of pain, and very talented\r\nattempts to exhibit this on the features of the victims. The creed of\r\nthe middle ages gave great scope for the indulgence of this taste in\r\nthe infinitely varied terrors of purgatory and hell; and, not to speak\r\nof the more crude descriptions that are so common in mediæval popular\r\nliterature, the account to which these descriptions might be turned by\r\nthe poet as well as the artist are well known to the reader of Dante.\r\nCoils of serpents and dragons, which were the most usual instruments\r\nin the tortures of the infernal regions, were always favourite objects\r\nin mediæval ornamentation, whether sculptured or drawn, in the details\r\nof architectural decoration, or in the initial letters and margins\r\nof books. They are often combined in forming grotesque tracery with\r\nthe bodies of animals or of human beings, and their movements are\r\ngenerally hostile to the latter. We have already seen, in previous\r\nchapters, examples of this use of serpents and dragons, dating from the\r\nearliest periods of mediæval art; and it is perhaps the most common\r\nstyle of ornamentation in the buildings and illuminated manuscripts\r\nin our island from the earlier Saxon times to the thirteenth century.\r\nThis ornamentation is sometimes strikingly bold and effective. In the\r\ncathedral of Wells there is a series of ornamental bosses, formed by\r\nfaces writhing under the attacks of numerous dragons, who are seizing\r\nupon the lips, eyes, and cheeks of their victims. One of these bosses,\r\nwhich are of the thirteenth century, is represented in our cut No. 98.\r\nA large, coarsely featured face is the victim of two dragons, one of\r\nwhich attacks his mouth, while the other has seized him by the eye. The\r\nexpression of the face is strikingly horrible.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 98. Horror._]\r\n\r\nThe higher mind of the middle ages loved to see inner meanings through\r\noutward forms; or, at least, it was a fashion which manifested itself\r\nmost strongly in the latter half of the twelfth century, to adapt these\r\noutward forms to inward meanings by comparisons and moralisations;\r\nand under the effect of this feeling certain figures were at times\r\nadopted, with a view to some other purpose than mere ornament, though\r\nthis was probably an innovation upon mediæval art. The tongue lolling\r\nout, taken originally, as we have seen, from the imagery of classic\r\ntimes, was accepted rather early in the middle ages as the emblem or\r\nsymbol of luxury; and, when we find it among the sculptured ornaments\r\nof the architecture especially of some of the larger and more important\r\nchurches, it implied probably an allusion to that vice--at least the\r\nface presented to us was intended to be that of a voluptuary. Among\r\nthe remarkable series of sculptures which crown the battlements of\r\nthe cloisters of Magdalen College, Oxford, executed a very few years\r\nafter the middle of the fifteenth century, amid many figures of a very\r\nmiscellaneous character, there are several which were thus, no doubt,\r\nintended to be representatives of vices, if not of virtues. I give two\r\nexamples of these curious sculptures.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 99. Gluttony._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 100. Luxury._]\r\n\r\nThe first, No. 99, is generally considered to represent gluttony, and\r\nit is a remarkable circumstance that, in a building the character of\r\nwhich was partly ecclesiastical, and which was erected at the expense\r\nand under the directions of a great prelate, Bishop Wainflete, the\r\nvice of gluttony, with which the ecclesiastical order was especially\r\nreproached, should be represented in ecclesiastical costume. It is an\r\nadditional proof that the detail of the work of the building was left\r\nentirely to the builders. The coarse, bloated features of the face,\r\nand the \"villainous\" low forehead, are characteristically executed;\r\nand the lolling tongue may perhaps be intended to intimate that, in\r\nthe lives of the clergy, luxury went hand in hand with its kindred\r\nvice. The second of our examples, No. 100, appears by its different\r\ncharacteristics (some of which we have been unable to introduce in our\r\nwoodcut) to be intended to represent luxury itself. Sometimes qualities\r\nof the individual man, or even the class of society, are represented in\r\na manner far less disguised by allegorical clothing, and therefore much\r\nmore plainly to the understanding of the vulgar. Thus in an illuminated\r\nmanuscript of the fourteenth century, in the British Museum (MS.\r\nArundel, No. 91), gluttony is represented by a monk devouring a pie\r\nalone and in secret, except that a little cloven-footed imp holds up\r\nthe dish, and seems to enjoy the prospect of monastic indulgence. This\r\npicture is copied in our cut No. 101. Another manuscript of the same\r\ndate (MS. Sloane, No. 2435) contains a scene, copied in our cut No.\r\n102, representing drunkenness under the form of another monk, who has\r\nobtained the keys and found his way into the cellar of his monastery,\r\nand is there indulging his love for good ale in similar secrecy. It\r\nis to be remarked that here, again, the vices are laid to the charge\r\nof the clergy. Our cut No. 103, from a bas-relief in Ely Cathedral,\r\ngiven in Carter's \"Specimens of Ancient Sculpture,\" represents a man\r\ndrinking from a horn, and evidently enjoying his employment, but his\r\ncostume is not sufficiently characteristic to betray his quality.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 101. Monkish Gluttony._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 102. The Monastic Cellarer._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 103. Drunkenness._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 104. A Strange Monster._]\r\n\r\nThe subject of grotesque faces and heads naturally leads us to\r\nthat of monstrous and grotesque bodies and groups of bodies, which\r\nhas already been partly treated in a former chapter, where we have\r\nnoticed the great love shown in the middle ages for monstrous animated\r\nfigures, not only monsters of one nature, but, and that especially,\r\nof figures formed by joining together the parts of different, and\r\nentirely dissimilar, animals, of similar mixtures between animals and\r\nmen. This, as stated above, was often effected by joining the body\r\nof some nondescript animal to a human head and face; so that, by the\r\ndisproportionate size of the latter, the body, as a secondary part\r\nof the picture, became only an adjunct to set off still further the\r\ngrotesque character of the human face. More importance was sometimes\r\ngiven to the body combined with fantastic forms, which baffle any\r\nattempt at giving an intelligible description. The accompanying cut,\r\nNo. 104, represents a winged monster of this kind; it is taken from\r\none of the casts from French churches exhibited in the Kensington\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 105. Rolling Topsy Turvy._]\r\n\r\nSometimes the mediæval artist, without giving any unusual form to\r\nhis human figures, placed them in strange postures, or joined them\r\nin singular combinations. These latter are commonly of a playful\r\ncharacter, or sometimes they represent droll feats of skill, or\r\npuzzles, or other subjects, all of which have been published\r\npictorially and for the amusement of children down to very recent\r\ntimes. There were a few of these groups which are of rather frequent\r\noccurrence, and they were evidently favourite types. One of these is\r\ngiven in the annexed cut, No. 105. It is taken from one of the carved\r\nmisereres of the stalls in Ely cathedral, as given in Carter, and\r\nrepresents two men who appear to be rolling over each other. The upper\r\nfigure exhibits animal's ears on his cap, which seem to proclaim him\r\na member of the fraternity of fools: the ears of the lower figure\r\nare concealed from view. This group is not a rare one, especially on\r\nsimilar monuments in France, where the architectural antiquaries have a\r\ntechnical name for it; and this shows us how even the particular forms\r\nof art in the middle ages were not confined to any particular country,\r\nbut more or less, and with exceptions, they pervaded all those which\r\nacknowledged the ecclesiastical supremacy of the church of Rome;\r\nwhatever peculiarity of style it took in particular countries, the same\r\nforms were spread through all western Europe. Our next cut, No. 106,\r\ngives another of these curious groups, consisting, in fact, of two\r\nindividuals, one of which is evidently an ecclesiastic. It will be seen\r\nthat, as we follow this round, we obtain, by means of the two heads,\r\nfour different figures in so many totally different positions. This\r\ngroup is taken from one of the very curious seats in the cathedral of\r\nRouen in Normandy, which were engraved and published in an interesting\r\nvolume by the late Monsieur E. H. Langlois.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 106. A Continuous Group._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 107. Border Ornament._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 108. A Triumphal Procession._]\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting of the mediæval burlesque drawings are\r\nthose which are found in such abundance in the borders of the pages of\r\nilluminated manuscripts. During the earlier periods of the mediæval\r\nminiatures, the favourite objects for these borders were monstrous\r\nanimals, especially dragons, which could easily be twined into\r\ngrotesque combinations. In course of time, the subjects thus introduced\r\nbecame more numerous, and in the fifteenth century they were very\r\nvaried. Strange animals still continued to be favourites, but they\r\nwere more light and elegant in their forms, and were more gracefully\r\ndesigned. Our cut No. 107, taken from the beautifully-illuminated\r\nmanuscript of the romance of the \"Comte d'Artois,\" of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, which has furnished us previously with several cuts, will\r\nillustrate my meaning. The graceful lightness of the tracery of the\r\nfoliage shown in this design is found in none of the earlier works\r\nof art of this class. This, of course, is chiefly to be ascribed to\r\nthe great advance which had been made in the art of design since the\r\nthirteenth century. But, though so greatly improved in the style of\r\nart, the same class of subjects continued to be introduced in this\r\nborder ornamentation long after the art of printing, and that of\r\nengraving, which accompanied it, had been introduced. The revolution\r\nin the ornamentation of the borders of the pages of books was effected\r\nby the artists of the sixteenth century, at which time people had\r\nbecome better acquainted with, and had learnt to appreciate, ancient\r\nart and Roman antiquities, and they drew their inspiration from a\r\ncorrect knowledge of what the middle ages had copied blindly, but had\r\nnot understood. Among the subjects of burlesque which the monuments\r\nof Roman art presented to them, the stumpy figures of the pigmies\r\nappear to have gained special favour, and they are employed in a manner\r\nwhich reminds us of the pictures found in Pompeii. Jost Amman, the\r\nwell-known artist, who exercised his profession at Nüremberg in the\r\nlatter half of the sixteenth century, engraved a set of illustrations\r\nto Ovid's Metamorphoses, which were printed at Lyons in 1574, and each\r\ncut and page of which is enclosed in a border of very fanciful and\r\nneatly-executed burlesque. The pigmies are introduced in these borders\r\nvery freely, and are grouped with great spirit. I select as an example,\r\ncut No. 108, a scene which represents a triumphal procession--some\r\npigmy Alexander returning from his conquests. The hero is seated on\r\na throne carried by an elephant, and before him a bird, perhaps a\r\nvanquished crane, proclaims loudly his praise. Before them a pigmy\r\nattendant marches proudly, carrying in one hand the olive branch of\r\npeace, and leading in the other a ponderous but captive ostrich, as a\r\ntrophy of his master's victories. Before him again a pigmy warrior,\r\nheavily armed with battle-axe and falchion, is mounting the steps\r\nof a stage, on which a nondescript animal, partaking somewhat of\r\nthe character of a sow, but perhaps intended as a burlesque on the\r\nstrange animals which, in mediæval romance, Alexander was said to have\r\nencountered in Egypt, blows a horn, to celebrate or announce the return\r\nof the conqueror. A snail, also advancing slowly up the stage, implies,\r\nperhaps, a sneer at the whole scene.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 109. The Mote and the Beam._]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these old German, Flemish, and Dutch artists were still\r\nmuch influenced by the mediæval spirit, which they displayed in their\r\ncoarse and clumsy imagination, in their neglect of everything like\r\ncongruity in their treatment of the subject with regard to time and\r\nplace, and their _naïve_ exaggerations and blunders. Extreme examples\r\nof these characteristics are spoken of, in which the Israelites\r\ncrossing the Red Sea are armed with muskets, and all the other\r\naccoutrements of modern soldiers, and in which Abraham is preparing\r\nto sacrifice his son Isaac by shooting him with a matchlock. In\r\ndelineating scriptural subjects, an attempt is generally made to\r\nclothe the figures in an imaginary ancient oriental costume, but the\r\nlandscapes are filled with the modern castles and mansion houses,\r\nchurches, and monasteries of western Europe. These half-mediæval\r\nartists, too, like their more ancient predecessors, often fall into\r\nunintentional caricature by the exaggeration or simplicity with which\r\nthey treat their subjects. There was one subject which the artists of\r\nthis period of regeneration of art seemed to have agreed to treat in\r\na very unimaginative manner. In the beautiful Sermon on the Mount,\r\nour Saviour, in condemning hasty judgments of other people's actions,\r\nsays (Matt. vii. 3-5), \"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy\r\nbrother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\r\nOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of\r\nthine eye, and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite,\r\nfirst cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see\r\nclearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\" Whatever be\r\nthe exact nature of the beam which the man was expected to overlook\r\nin his \"own eye,\" it certainly was not a large beam of timber. Yet\r\nsuch was the conception of it by artists of the sixteenth century.\r\nOne of them, named Solomon Bernard, designed a series of woodcuts\r\nillustrating the New Testament, which were published at Lyons in 1553;\r\nand the manner in which he treated the subject will be seen in our\r\ncut No. 109, taken from one of the illustrations to that book. The\r\nindividual seated is the man who has a mote in his eye, which the\r\nother, approaching him, points out; and he retorts by pointing to the\r\n\"beam,\" which is certainly such a massive object as could not easily\r\nhave been overlooked. About thirteen years before this, an artist of\r\nAugsburg, named Daniel Hopfer, had published a large copper-plate\r\nengraving of this same subject, a reduced copy of which is given in the\r\ncut No. 110. The individual who sees the mote in his brother's eye, is\r\nevidently treating it in the character of a physician or surgeon. It\r\nis only necessary to add that the beam in his own eye is of still more\r\nextraordinary dimensions than the former, and that, though it seems\r\nto escape the notice both of himself and his patient, it is evident\r\nthat the group in the distance contemplate it with astonishment. The\r\nbuilding accompanying this scene appears to be a church, with paintings\r\nof saints in the windows.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 110. The Mote and the Beam--Another Treatment._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  SATIRICAL LITERATURE IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--JOHN DE HAUTEVILLE AND ALAN\r\n     DE LILLE.--GOLIAS AND THE GOLIARDS.--THE GOLIARDIC POETRY.--TASTE\r\n     FOR PARODY.--PARODIES ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS.--POLITICAL\r\n     CARICATURE IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--THE JEWS OF NORWICH.--CARICATURE\r\n     REPRESENTATIONS OF COUNTRIES.--LOCAL SATIRE.--POLITICAL SONGS AND\r\n     POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter I have spoken of a class of satirical literature\r\nwhich was entirely popular in its character. Not that on this account\r\nit was original among the peoples who composed mediæval society, for\r\nthe intellectual development of the middle ages came almost all from\r\nRome through one medium or other, although we know so little of the\r\ndetails of the popular literature of the Romans that we cannot always\r\ntrace it. The mediæval literature of western Europe was mostly modelled\r\nupon that of France, which was received, like its language, from Rome.\r\nBut when the great university system became established, towards the\r\nend of the eleventh century, the scholars of western Europe became\r\nmore directly acquainted with the models of literature which antiquity\r\nhad left them; and during the twelfth century these found imitators\r\nso skilful that some of them almost deceive us into accepting them\r\nfor classical writers themselves. Among the first of these models to\r\nattract the attention of mediæval scholars, were the Roman satirists,\r\nand the study of them produced, during the twelfth century, a number of\r\nsatirical writers in Latin prose and verse, who are remarkable not only\r\nfor their boldness and poignancy, but for the elegance of their style.\r\nI may mention among those of English birth, John of Salisbury, Walter\r\nMapes, and Giraldus Cambrensis, who all wrote in prose, and Nigellus\r\nWireker, already mentioned in a former chapter, and John de Hauteville,\r\nwho wrote in verse. The first of these, in his \"Polycraticus,\" Walter\r\nMapes, in his book \"De Nugis Curialium,\" and Giraldus, in his \"Speculum\r\nEcclesiæ,\" and several other of his writings, lay the lash on the\r\ncorruptions and vices of their contemporaries with no tender hand.\r\nThe two most remarkable English satirists of the twelfth century were\r\nJohn de Hauteville and Nigellus Wireker. The former wrote, in the year\r\n1184, a poem in nine books of Latin hexameters, entitled, after the\r\nname of its hero, \"Architrenius,\" or the Arch-mourner. Architrenius\r\nis represented as a youth, arrived at years of maturity, who sorrows\r\nover the spectacle of human vices and weaknesses, until he resolves to\r\ngo on a pilgrimage to Dame Nature, in order to expostulate with her\r\nfor having made him feeble to resist the temptations of the world,\r\nand to entreat her assistance. On his way, he arrives successively at\r\nthe court of Venus and at the abode of Gluttony, which give him the\r\noccasion to dwell at considerable length on the license and luxury\r\nwhich prevailed among his contemporaries. He next reaches Paris, and\r\nvisits the famous mediæval university, and his satire on the manners of\r\nthe students and the fruitlessness of their studies, forms a remarkable\r\nand interesting picture of the age. The pilgrim next arrives at the\r\nMount of Ambition, tempting by its beauty and by the stately palace\r\nwith which it was crowned, and here we are presented with a satire on\r\nthe manners and corruptions of the court. Near to this was the Hill of\r\nPresumption, which was inhabited by ecclesiastics of all classes, great\r\nscholastic doctors and professors, monks, and the like. It is a satire\r\non the manners of the clergy. As Architrenius turns from this painful\r\nspectacle, he encounters a gigantic and hideous monster named Cupidity,\r\nis led into a series of reflections upon the greediness and avarice\r\nof the prelates, from which he is roused by the uproar caused by a\r\nfierce combat between the prodigals and the misers. He is subsequently\r\ncarried to the island of far-distant Thule, which he finds to be the\r\nresting-place of the philosophers of ancient Greece, and he listens\r\nto their declamations against the vices of mankind. After this visit,\r\nArchitrenius reaches the end of his pilgrimage. He finds Nature in the\r\nform of a beautiful woman, dwelling with a host of attendants in the\r\nmidst of a flowery plain, and meats with a courteous reception, but she\r\nbegins by giving him a long lecture on natural philosophy. After this\r\nis concluded, Dame Nature listens to his complaints, and, to console\r\nhim, gives him a handsome woman, named Moderation, for a wife, and\r\ndismisses him with a chapter of good counsels on the duties of married\r\nlife. The general moral intended to be inculcated appears to be that\r\nthe retirement of domestic happiness is to be preferred to the vain and\r\nheartless turmoils of active life in all its phases. It will be seen\r\nthat the kind of allegory which subsequently produced the \"Pilgrim's\r\nProgress,\" had already made its appearance in mediæval literature.\r\n\r\nAnother of the celebrated satirists of the scholastic ages was\r\nnamed Alanus de Insulis, or Alan of Lille, because he is understood\r\nto have been born at Lille in Flanders. He occupied the chair of\r\ntheology for many years in the university of Paris with great\r\ndistinction, and his learning was so extensive that he gained the\r\nname of _doctor universalis_, the universal doctor. In one of his\r\nbooks, which is an imitation of that favourite book in the middle\r\nages \"Boethius de Consolatione Philosophiæ,\" Dame Nature, in the\r\nplace of Philosophy--not, as in John de Hauteville, as the referee,\r\nbut as the complainant--is introduced bitterly lamenting over the\r\ndeep depravity of the thirteenth century, especially displayed in\r\nthe prevalence of vices of a revolting character. This work, which,\r\nlike Boethius, consists of alternate chapters in verse and prose, is\r\nentitled \"De Planctu Naturæ,\" the lamentation of nature. I will not,\r\nhowever, go on here to give a list of the graver satirical writers, but\r\nwe will proceed to another class of satirists which sprang up among\r\nthe mediæval scholars, more remarkable and more peculiar in their\r\ncharacter--I mean peculiar to the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe satires of the time show us that the students in the universities\r\nin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, who enjoyed a great amount\r\nof independence from authority, were generally wild and riotous, and,\r\namong the vast number of youths who then devoted themselves to a\r\nscholastic life, we can have no doubt that the habit of dissipation\r\nbecame permanent. Among these wild students there existed, probably,\r\nfar more wit and satirical talent than among their steadier and more\r\nlaborious brethren, and this wit, and the manner in which it was\r\ndisplayed, made its possessors welcome guests at the luxurious tables\r\nof the higher and richer clergy, at which Latin seems to have been\r\nthe language in ordinary use. In all probability it was from this\r\ncircumstance (in allusion to the Latin word _gula_, as intimating their\r\nlove of the table) that these merry scholars, who displayed in Latin\r\nsome of the accomplishments which the jougleurs professed in the vulgar\r\ntongue, took or received the name of _goliards_ (in the Latin of that\r\ntime, _goliardi_, or _goliardenses_).[42] The name at least appears\r\nto have been adopted towards the end of the twelfth century. In the\r\nyear 1229, during the minority of Louis IX., and while the government\r\nof France was in the hands of the queen-mother, troubles arose in the\r\nuniversity of Paris through the intrigues of the papal legate, and the\r\nturbulence of the scholars led to their dispersion and to the temporary\r\nclosing of the schools; and the contemporary historian, Matthew Paris,\r\ntells us how \"some of the servants of the departing scholars, or those\r\nwhom we used to call goliardenses,\" composed an indecent epigram on\r\nthe rumoured familiarities between the legate and the queen. But this\r\nis not the first mention of the goliards, for a statute of the council\r\nof Treves, in 1227, forbade \"all priests to permit truants, or other\r\nwandering scholars, or goliards, to sing verses or _Sanctus_ and\r\n_Angelus Dei_ in the service of the mass.\"[43] This probably refers to\r\nparodies on the religious service, such as those of which I shall soon\r\nhave to speak. From this time the goliards are frequently mentioned. In\r\necclesiastical statutes published in the year 1289, it is ordered that\r\nthe clerks or clergy (_clerici_, that is, men who had their education\r\nin the university) \"should not be jougleurs, goliards, or buffoons;\"[44]\r\nand the same statute proclaims a heavy penalty against those _clerici_\r\n\"who persist in the practice of goliardy or stage performance during a\r\nyear,\"[45] which shows that they exercised more of the functions of the\r\njougleur than the mere singing of songs.\r\n\r\n [42] In the mediæval Latin, the word _goliardia_ was introduced to\r\n      express the profession of the goliard, and the verb\r\n      _goliardizare_, to signify the practice of it.\r\n\r\n [43] \"Item, præcipimus ut omnes sacerdotes non permittant trutannos et\r\n      alios vagos scholares, aut goliardos, cantare versus super\r\n     _Sanctus_ et _Angelus Dei_ in missis,\" etc.--Concil. Trevir.,\r\n     an. 1227, ap. Marten. et Durand. Ampliss. Coll., vii. col. 117.\r\n\r\n [44] \"Item, præcipimus quod clerici non sint joculatores, goliardi, seu\r\n      bufones.\"--Stat. Synod. Caduacensis, Ruthenensis, et Tutelensis\r\n      Eccles. ap. Martene, Thes. Anecd., iv. col. 727.\r\n\r\n [45] \"Clerici ... si in goliardia vel histrionatu per annum\r\n      fuerint.\"--Ib. col. 729. In one of the editions of this statute it\r\n      is added, \"after they have been warned three times.\"\r\n\r\nThese vagabond clerks made for themselves an imaginary chieftain,\r\nor president of their order, to whom they gave the name of Golias,\r\nprobably as a pun on the name of the giant who combated against David,\r\nand, to show further their defiance of the existing church government,\r\nthey made him a bishop--_Golias episcopus_. Bishop Golias was the\r\nburlesque representative of the clerical order, the general satirist,\r\nthe reformer of eclesiastical and all other corruptions. If he was not\r\na doctor of divinity, he was a master of arts, for he is spoken of as\r\n_Magister Golias_. But above all he was the father of the Goliards,\r\nthe \"ribald clerks,\" as they are called, who all belonged to his\r\nhousehold,[46] and they are spoken of as his children.\r\n\r\n          _Summa salus omnium, filius Mariæ,\r\n          Pascat, potat, vestiat pueros Golyæ!_[47]\r\n\r\n\"May the Saviour of all, the Son of Mary, give food, drink, and clothes\r\nto the children of Golias!\" Still the name was clothed in so much\r\nmystery, that Giraldus Cambrensis, who flourished towards the latter\r\nend of the twelfth century, believed Golias to be a real personage,\r\nand his contemporary. It may be added that Golias not only boasts of\r\nthe dignity of bishop, but he appears sometimes under the title of\r\n_archipoeta_, the archpoet or poet-in-chief.\r\n\r\n [46] \"Clerici ribaldi, maxime qui vulgo dicuntur _de famila\r\n      Goliæ_.\"--Concil. Sen. ap. Concil., tom. ix. p. 578.\r\n\r\n [47] See my \"Poems of Walter Mapes,\" p. 70.\r\n\r\nCæsarius of Heisterbach, who completed his book of the miracles of his\r\ntime in the year 1222, tells us a curious anecdote of the character\r\nof the wandering clerk. In the year before he wrote, he tells us, \"It\r\nhappened at Bonn, in the diocese of Cologne, that a certain wandering\r\nclerk, named Nicholas, of the class they call archpoet, was grievously\r\nill, and when he supposed that he was dying, he obtained from our\r\nabbot, through his own pleading, and the intercession of the canons\r\nof the same church, admission into the order. What more? He put on\r\nthe tunic, as it appeared to us, with much contrition, but, when the\r\ndanger was past, he took it off immediately, and, throwing it down with\r\nderision, took to flight.\" We learn best the character of the goliards\r\nfrom their own poetry, a considerable quantity of which is preserved.\r\nThey wandered about from mansion to mansion, probably from monastery\r\nto monastery, just like the jougleurs, but they seem to have been\r\nespecially welcome at the tables of the prelates of the church, and,\r\nlike the jougleurs, besides being well feasted, they received gifts of\r\nclothing and other articles. In few instances only were they otherwise\r\nthan welcome, as described in the rhyming epigram printed in my \"Latin\r\nPoems attributed to Walter Mapes.\" \"I come uninvited,\" says the goliard\r\nto the bishop, \"ready for dinner; such is my fate, never to dine\r\ninvited.\" The bishop replies, \"I care not for vagabonds, who wander\r\namong the fields, and cottages, and villages; such guests are not for\r\nmy table. I do not invite you, for I avoid such as you; yet without my\r\nwill you may eat the bread you ask. Wash, wipe, sit, dine, drink, wipe,\r\nand depart.\"\r\n\r\n                          Goliardus.\r\n        _Non invitatus venio prandere paratus;\r\n        Sic sum fatatus, nunquam prandere vocatus._\r\n\r\n                          Episcopus.\r\n        _Non ego curo vagos, qui rura, mapalia, pagos\r\n        Perlustrant, tales non vult mea mensa sodales.\r\n        Te non invito, tibi consimiles ego vito;\r\n        Me tamen invito potieris pane petito.\r\n        Ablue, terge, sede, prande, bibe, terge, recede._\r\n\r\nIn another similar epigram, the goliard complains of the bishop who\r\nhad given him as his reward nothing but an old worn-out mantle. Most\r\nof the writers of the goliardic poetry complain of their poverty, and\r\nsome of them admit that this poverty arose from the tavern and the love\r\nof gambling. One of them alleges as his claim to the liberality of\r\nhis host, that, as he was a scholar, he had not learnt to labour, that\r\nhis parents were knights, but he had no taste for fighting, and that,\r\nin a word, he preferred poetry to any occupation. Another speaks still\r\nmore to the point, and complains that he is in danger of being obliged\r\nto sell his clothes. \"If this garment of vair which I wear,\" he says,\r\n\"be sold for money, it will be a great disgrace to me; I would rather\r\nsuffer a long fast. A bishop, who is the most generous of all generous\r\nmen, gave me this cloak, and will have for it heaven, a greater reward\r\nthan St. Martin has, who only gave half of his cloak. It is needful\r\nnow that the poet's want be relieved by your liberality [addressing\r\nhis hearers]; let noble men give noble gifts--gold, and robes, and the\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\n          _Si vendatur propter denarium\r\n          Indumentum quod porto varium,\r\n          Grande mihi fiet opprobrium;\r\n          Malo diu pati jejunium.\r\n          Largissimus largorum omnium\r\n          Prœsul dedit mihi hoc pallium,\r\n          Majus habens in cælis præmium\r\n          Quam Martinus, qui dedit medium.\r\n          Nunc est opus ut vestra copia\r\n          Sublevetur vatis inopia;\r\n          Dent nobiles dona nobilia,--\r\n          Aurum, vestes, et his similia._\r\n\r\nThere has been some difference of opinion as to the country to which\r\nthis poetry more especially belongs. Giraldus Cambrensis, writing at\r\nthe end of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century,\r\nevidently thought that Golias was an Englishman; and at a later date\r\nthe goliardic poetry was almost all ascribed to Giraldus's contemporary\r\nand friend, the celebrated humourist, Walter Mapes. This was, no doubt,\r\nan error. Jacob Grimm seemed inclined to claim them for Germany; but\r\nGrimm, on this occasion, certainly took a narrow view of the question.\r\nWe shall probably be more correct in saying that they belonged in\r\ncommon to all the countries over which university learning extended;\r\nthat in whatever country a particular poem of this class was composed,\r\nit became the property of the whole body of these scholastic jougleurs,\r\nand that it was thus carried from one land to another, receiving\r\nsometimes alterations or additions to adapt it to each. Several of\r\nthese poems are found in manuscripts written in different countries\r\nwith such alterations and additions, as, for instance, that in the\r\nwell-known \"Confession,\" in the English copies of which we have, near\r\nthe conclusion, the line--\r\n\r\n               _Præsul Coventrensium, parce confitenti;_\r\n\r\nan appeal to the bishop of Coventry, which is changed, in a copy in a\r\nGerman manuscript, to\r\n\r\n                 _Electe Coloniæ, parce pœnitenti,_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O elect of Cologne, spare me penitent.\" From a comparison of what\r\nremains of this poetry in manuscripts written in different countries,\r\nit appears probable that the names Golias and goliard originated in the\r\nuniversity of Paris, but were more especially popular in England, while\r\nthe term _archipoeta_ was more commonly used in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 I collected all the goliardic poetry which I could then find in\r\nEnglish manuscripts, and edited it, under the name of Walter Mapes, as\r\none of the publications of the Camden Society.[48] At a rather later\r\ndate I gave a chapter of additional matter of the same description\r\nin my \"Anecdota Literaria.\"[49] All the poems I have printed in\r\nthese two volumes are found in manuscripts written in England, and\r\nsome of them are certainly the compositions of English writers. They\r\nare distinguished by remarkable facility and ease in versification\r\nand rhyme, and by great pungency of satire. The latter is directed\r\nespecially against the clerical order, and none are spared, from the\r\npope at the summit of the scale down to the lowest of the clergy. In\r\nthe \"Apocalypsis Goliæ,\" or Golias's Revelations, which appears to\r\nhave been the most popular of all these poems,[50] the poet describes\r\nhimself as carried up in a vision to heaven, where the vices and\r\ndisorders of the various classes of the popish clergy are successively\r\nrevealed to him. The pope is a devouring lion; in his eagerness for\r\npounds, he pawns books; at the sight of a mark of money, he treats Mark\r\nthe Evangelist with disdain; while he sails aloft, money alone is his\r\nanchoring-place. The original lines will serve as a specimen of the\r\nstyle of these curious compositions, and of the love of punning which\r\nwas so characteristic of the literature of that age:--\r\n\r\n          _Est leo pontifex summus, qui devorat,\r\n          Qui libras sitiens, libros impignorat;\r\n          Marcam respiciet, Marcum dedecorat;\r\n          In summis navigans, in nummis anchorat._\r\n\r\n [48] The Latin Poems commonly attributed to Walter Mapes, collected and\r\n      edited by Thomas Wright, Esq., 4to., London, 1841.\r\n\r\n [49] \"Anecdota Literaria; a Collection of Short Poems in English,\r\n      Latin, and French, illustrative of the Literature and History of\r\n      England in the Thirteenth Century.\" Edited by Thomas Wright, Esq.\r\n      8vo., London, 1844.\r\n\r\n [50] In my edition I have collated no less than sixteen copies which\r\n      occur among the MSS. in the British Museum, and in the libraries\r\n      at Oxford and Cambridge, and there are, no doubt, many more.\r\n\r\nThe bishop is in haste to intrude himself into other people's pastures,\r\nand fills himself with other people's goods. The ravenous archdeacon\r\nis compared to an eagle, because he has sharp eyes to see his prey\r\nafar off, and is swift to seize upon it. The dean is represented by an\r\nanimal with a man's face, full of silent guile, who covers fraud with\r\nthe form of justice, and by the show of simplicity would make others\r\nbelieve him to be pious. In this spirit the faults of the clergy, of\r\nall degrees, are minutely criticised through between four and five\r\nhundred lines; and it must not be forgotten that it was the English\r\nclergy whose character was thus exposed.\r\n\r\n          _Tu scribes etiam, forma sed alia,\r\n          Septem ecclesiis quæ sunt in Anglia._\r\n\r\nOthers of these pieces are termed Sermons, and are addressed, some to\r\nthe bishops and dignitaries of the church, others to the pope, others\r\nto the monastic orders, and others to the clergy in general. The court\r\nof Rome, we are told, was infamous for its greediness; there all right\r\nand justice were put up for sale, and no favour could be had without\r\nmoney. In this court money occupies everybody's thoughts; its cross--i.\r\ne. the mark on the reverse of the coin--its roundness, and its\r\nwhiteness, all please the Romans; where money speaks law is silent.\r\n\r\n          _Nummis in hac curia non est qui non vacet;\r\n          Crux placet, rotunditas, et albedo placet,\r\n          Et cum totum placeat, et Romanis placet,\r\n          Ubi nummus loquitur, et lex omnis tacet._\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most curious of these poems is the \"Confession of\r\nGolias,\" in which the poet is made to satirise himself, and he thus\r\ngives us a curious picture of the goliard's life. He complains that\r\nhe is made of light material, which is moved by every wind; that he\r\nwanders about irregularly, like the ship on the sea or the bird in the\r\nair, seeking worthless companions like himself. He is a slave to the\r\ncharms of the fair sex. He is a martyr to gambling, which often turns\r\nhim out naked to the cold, but he is warmed inwardly by the inspiration\r\nof his mind, and he writes better poetry than ever. Lechery and\r\ngambling are two of his vices, and the third is drinking. \"The tavern,\"\r\nhe says, \"I never despised, nor shall I ever despise it, until I see\r\nthe holy angels coming to sing the eternal requiem over my corpse. It\r\nis my design to die in the tavern; let wine be placed to my mouth when\r\nI am expiring, that when the choirs of angels come, they may say, 'Be\r\nGod propitious to this drinker!' The lamp of the soul is lighted with\r\ncups; the heart steeped in nectar flies up to heaven; and the wine in\r\nthe tavern has for me a better flavour than that which the bishop's\r\nbutler mixes with water.... Nature gives to every one his peculiar\r\ngift: I never could write fasting; a boy could beat me in composition\r\nwhen I am hungry; I hate thirst and fasting as much as death.\"\r\n\r\n          _Tertio capitulo memoro tabernam:\r\n          Illam nullo tempore sprevi, neque spernam,\r\n          Donec sanctos angelos venientes cernam,\r\n          Cantantes pro mortuo requiem æternam._\r\n\r\n          _Meum est propositum in taberna mori;\r\n          Vindum sit appositum morientis ori,\r\n          Ut dicant cum venerint angelorum chori,\r\n          'Deus sit propitius huic potatori!'_\r\n\r\n          _Poculis accenditur animi lucerna;\r\n          Cor imbutum nectare volat ad superna:\r\n          Mihi sapit dulcius vinum in taberna,\r\n          Quam quod aqua miscuit præsulis pincerna._\r\n\r\n          _Unicuique proprium dat natura munus:\r\n          Ego nunquam potui scribere jejunus;\r\n          Me jejunum vincere posset puer unus;\r\n          Sitim et jejunium odi tanquam funus._[51]\r\n\r\nAnother of the more popular of these goliardic poems was the advice of\r\nGolias against marriage, a gross satire upon the female sex. Contrary\r\nto what we might perhaps expect from their being written in Latin, many\r\nof these metrical satires are directed against the vices of the laity,\r\nas well as against those of the clergy.\r\n\r\n [51] Poems attributed to Walter Mapes, p. 73. The stanzas here quoted,\r\n      with some others, were afterwards made up into a drinking song,\r\n      which was rather popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the celebrated German scholar, Jacob Grimm, published in the\r\n\"Transactions of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin\" a selection of\r\ngoliardic verses from manuscripts in Germany, which had evidently been\r\nwritten by Germans, and some of them containing allusions to German\r\naffairs in the thirteenth century.[52] They present the same form of\r\nverse and the same style of satire as those found in England, but the\r\nname of Golias is exchanged for _archipoeta_, the archpoet. Some of\r\nthe stanzas of the \"Confession of Golias\" are found in a poem in which\r\nthe archpoet addresses a petition to the archchancellor for assistance\r\nin his distress, and confesses his partiality for wine. A copy of the\r\nConfession itself is also found in this German collection, under the\r\ntitle of the \"Poet's Confession.\"\r\n\r\n [52] \"Gedichte des Mittelalters auf König Friedrich I. den Staufar, und\r\n      aus seiner so wie der nächstfolgenden Zeit,\" 4to. Separate copies\r\n      of this work were printed off and distributed among mediæval\r\n      scholars.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Library at Munich contains a very important manuscript of\r\nthis goliardic Latin poetry, written in the thirteenth century. It\r\nbelonged originally to one of the great Benedictine abbeys in Bavaria,\r\nwhere it appears to have been very carefully preserved, but still\r\nwith an apparent consciousness that it was not exactly a book for a\r\nreligious brotherhood, which led the monks to omit it in the catalogue\r\nof their library, no doubt as a book the possession of which was not\r\nto be proclaimed publicly. When written, it was evidently intended\r\nto be a careful selection of the poetry of this class then current.\r\nOne part of it consists of poetry of a more serious character, such\r\nas hymns, moral poems, and especially satirical pieces. In this class\r\nthere are more than one piece which are also found in the manuscripts\r\nwritten in England. A very large portion of the collection consists\r\nof love songs, which, although evidently treasured by the Benedictine\r\nmonks, are sometimes licentious in character. A third class consists\r\nof drinking and gambling songs (_potatoria et lusoria_). The general\r\ncharacter of this poetry is more playful, more ingenious and intricate\r\nin its metrical structure, in fact, more lyric than that of the poetry\r\nwe have been describing; yet it came, in all probability, from the same\r\nclass of poets--the clerical jougleurs. The touches of sentiment, the\r\ndescriptions of female beauty, the admiration of nature, are sometimes\r\nexpressed with remarkable grace. Thus, the green wood sweetly enlivened\r\nby the joyous voices of its feathered inhabitants, the shade of its\r\nbranches, the thorns covered with flowers, which, says the poet, are\r\nemblematical of love, which pricks like a thorn and then soothes like a\r\nflower, are tastefully described in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n              _Cantu nemus avium\r\n              Lascivia canentium\r\n              Suave delinitur,\r\n              Fronde redimitur,\r\n              Vernant spinæ floribus\r\n              Micantibus,\r\n              Venerem signantibus\r\n              Quia spina pungit, flos blanditur._\r\n\r\nAnd the following scrap of the description of a beautiful damsel shows\r\nno small command of language and versification--\r\n\r\n              _Allicit dulcibus\r\n              Verbis et osculis,\r\n              Labellulis\r\n              Castigate tumentibus,\r\n              Roseo nectareus\r\n              Odor infusus ori;\r\n              Pariter eburneus\r\n              Sedat ordo dentium\r\n              Par niveo candori._\r\n\r\nThe whole contents of this manuscript were printed in 1847, in an\r\noctavo volume, issued by the Literary Society at Stuttgard.[53] I had\r\nalready printed some examples of such amatory Latin lyric poetry in\r\n1838, in a volume of \"Early Mysteries and Latin Poems;\"[54] but this\r\npoetry does not belong properly to the subject of the present volume,\r\nand I pass on from it.\r\n\r\n [53] \"Carmina Burana. Lateinische und Deutsche Lieder und Gedichte\r\n      einer Handschrift des XIII. Jahrhunderts aus Benedictbeurn auf\r\n      der K. Bibliothek zu München.\" 8vo. Stuttgart, 1847.\r\n\r\n [54] \"Early Mysteries and other Latin Poems of the Twelfth and\r\n      Thirteenth Centuries,\" edited by Thomas Wright, Esq. 8vo. London,\r\n      1838.\r\n\r\nThe goliards did not always write in verse, for we have some of\r\ntheir prose compositions, and these appear especially in the form\r\nof parodies. We trace a great love for parody in the middle ages,\r\nwhich spared not even things the most sacred, and the examples\r\nbrought forward in the celebrated trial of William Hone, were mild in\r\ncomparison to some which are found scattered here and there in mediæval\r\nmanuscripts. In my Poems, attributed to Walter Mapes,[55] I have\r\nprinted a satire in prose entitled \"_Magister Golyas de quodam abbate_\"\r\n(i.e., Master Golias's account of a certain abbot), which has somewhat\r\nthe character of a parody upon a saint's legend. The voluptuous life of\r\nthe superior of a monastic house is here described in a tone of banter\r\nwhich nothing could excel. Several parodies, more direct in their\r\ncharacter, are printed in the two volumes of the \"Reliquæ Antiquæ.\"[56]\r\nOne of these (vol. ii. p. 208) is a complete parody on the service of\r\nthe mass, which is entitled in the original, \"_Missa de Potatoribus_,\"\r\nthe Mass of the Drunkard. In this extraordinary composition, even the\r\npater-noster is parodied. A portion of this, with great variations, is\r\nfound in the German collection of the Carmina Burana, under the title\r\nof _Officium Lusorum_, the Office of the Gamblers. In the \"Reliquæ\r\nAntiquæ\" (ii. 58) we have a parody on the Gospel of St. Luke, beginning\r\nwith the words, _Initium fallacis Evangelii secundum Lupum_, this last\r\nword being, of course, a sort of pun upon Lucam. Its subject also is\r\nBacchus, and the scene having been laid in a tavern in Oxford, we have\r\nno difficulty in ascribing it to some scholar of that university in the\r\nthirteenth century. Among the Carmina Burana we find a similar parody\r\non the Gospel of St. Mark, which has evidently belonged to one of these\r\nburlesques on the church service; and as it is less profane than the\r\nothers, and at the same time pictures the mediæval hatred towards the\r\nchurch of Rome, I will give a translation of it as an example of this\r\nsingular class of compositions. It is hardly necessary to remind the\r\nreader that a mark was a coin of the value of thirteen shillings and\r\nfourpence:--\r\n\r\n     \"The beginning of the holy gospel according to Marks of silver.\r\n     At that time the pope said to the Romans: 'When the son of man\r\n     shall come to the seat of our majesty, first say, Friend, for what\r\n     hast thou come? But if he should persevere in knocking without\r\n     giving you anything, cast him out into utter darkness.' And it\r\n     came to pass, that a certain poor clerk came to the court of the\r\n     lord the pope, and cried out, saying, 'Have pity on me at least,\r\n     you doorkeepers of the pope, for the hand of poverty has touched\r\n     me. For I am needy and poor, and therefore I seek your assistance\r\n     in my calamity and misery.' But they hearing this were highly\r\n     indignant, and said to him: 'Friend, thy poverty be with thee in\r\n     perdition; get thee backward, Satan, for thou dost not savour of\r\n     those things which have the savour of money. Verily, verily, I say\r\n     unto thee, Thou shalt not enter into the joy of thy lord, until\r\n     thou shalt have given thy last farthing.'\r\n\r\n     \"Then the poor man went away, and sold his cloak and his gown,\r\n     and all that he had, and gave it to the cardinals, and to the\r\n     doorkeepers, and to the chamberlains. But they said, 'And what is\r\n     this among so many?' And they cast him out of the gates, and going\r\n     out he wept bitterly, and was without consolation. After him there\r\n     came to the court a certain clerk who was rich, and gross, and\r\n     fat, and large, and who in a tumult had committed manslaughter. He\r\n     gave first to the doorkeeper, secondly to the chamberlain, third\r\n     to the cardinals. But they judged among themselves, that they\r\n     were to receive more. Then the lord the pope, hearing that the\r\n     cardinals and officials had received many gifts from the clerk,\r\n     became sick unto death. But the rich man sent him an electuary of\r\n     gold and silver, and he was immediately made whole. Then the lord\r\n     the pope called before him the cardinals and officials, and said\r\n     to them: 'Brethren, see that no one deceive you with empty words.\r\n     For I give you an example, that, as I take, so take ye also.'\"\r\n\r\n [55] Introduction, p. xl.\r\n\r\n [56] \"Reliquiæ Antiquæ. Scraps from Ancient Manuscripts, illustrating\r\n      chiefly Early English Literature and the English Language.\" Edited\r\n      by Thomas Wright, Esq., and J. O. Halliwell, Esq. 2 vols. 8vo.\r\n      Vol. i., London, 1841; vol. ii., 1843.\r\n\r\nThis mediæval love of parody was not unfrequently displayed in a\r\nmore popular form, and in the language of the people. In the _Reliquæ\r\nAntiquæ_ (i. 82) we have a very singular parody in English on the\r\nsermons of the Catholic priesthood, a good part of which is so written\r\nas to present no consecutive sense, which circumstance itself implies\r\na sneer at the preachers. Thus our burlesque preacher, in the middle\r\nof his discourse, proceeds to narrate as follows (I modernise the\r\nEnglish):--\r\n\r\n     \"Sirs, what time that God and St. Peter came to Rome, Peter asked\r\n     Adam a full great doubtful question, and said, 'Adam, Adam, why\r\n     ate thou the apple unpared?' 'Forsooth,' quod he, 'for I had no\r\n     wardens (pears) fried.' And Peter saw the fire, and dread him, and\r\n     stepped into a plum-tree that hanged full of ripe red cherries.\r\n     And there he saw all the parrots in the sea. There he saw steeds\r\n     and stockfish pricking 'swose' (?) in the water. There he saw hens\r\n     and herrings that hunted after harts in hedges. There he saw eels\r\n     roasting larks. There he saw haddocks were done on the pillory for\r\n     wrong roasting of May butter; and there he saw how bakers baked\r\n     butter to grease with old monks' boots. There he saw how the fox\r\n     preached,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe same volume contains some rather clever parodies on the old English\r\nalliterative romances, composed in a similar style of consecutive\r\nnonsense. It is a class of parody which we trace to a rather early\r\nperiod, which the French term a _coq-à-l'âne_, and which became\r\nfashionable in England in the seventeenth century in the form of\r\nsongs entitled \"Tom-a-Bedlams.\" M. Jubinal has printed two such poems\r\nin French, perhaps of the thirteenth century,[57] and others are\r\nfound scattered through the old manuscripts. There is generally so\r\nmuch coarseness in them that it is not easy to select a portion for\r\ntranslation, and in fact their point consists in going on through the\r\nlength of a poem of this kind without imparting a single clear idea.\r\nThus, in the second of those published by Jubinal, we are told how,\r\n\"The shadow of an egg carried the new year upon the bottom of a pot;\r\ntwo old new combs made a ball to run the trot; when it came to paying\r\nthe scot, I, who never move myself, cried out, without saying a word,\r\n'Take the feather of an ox, and clothe a wise fool with it.'\"--\r\n\r\n        _Li ombres d'un oef\r\n        Portoit l'an reneuf\r\n        Sur la fonz d'un pot;\r\n        Deus viez pinges neuf\r\n        Firent un estuef\r\n        Pour courre le trot;\r\n        Quant vint au paier l'escot,\r\n        Je, qui onques ne me muef,\r\n        M'escriai, si ne dis mot:--\r\n        'Prenés la plume d'un buef,\r\n        S'en vestez un sage sot.'_--Jubinal, Nouv. Rec., ii. 217.\r\n\r\n [57] \"Achille Jubinal, Jongleurs et Trouvères.\" 8vo., Paris, 1835, p.\r\n      34; and \"Nouveau Recueil de Contes, Dits, Fabliaux,\" &c. 8vo.,\r\n      Paris, 1842. Vol. ii. p. 208. In the first instance M. Jubinal has\r\n      given to this little poem the title _Resveries_, in the second,\r\n      _Fatrasies_.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the goliards continued to exist long after the name\r\nhad been forgotten; and the mass of bitter satire which they had\r\nleft behind them against the whole papal system, and against the\r\ncorruptions of the papal church of the middle ages, were a perfect\r\ngodsend to the reformers of the sixteenth century, who could point\r\nto them triumphantly as irresistible evidence in their favour. Such\r\nscholars as Flacius Illyricus, eagerly examined the manuscripts\r\nwhich contained this goliardic poetry, and printed it, chiefly as\r\ngood and effective weapons in the great religious strife which was\r\nthen convulsing European society. To us, besides their interest as\r\nliterary compositions, they have also a historical value, for they\r\nintroduce us to a more intimate acquaintance with the character of the\r\ngreat mental struggle for emancipation from mediæval darkness which\r\nextended especially through the thirteenth century, and which was only\r\novercome for a while to begin more strongly and more successfully at\r\na later period. They display to us the gross ignorance, as well as\r\nthe corruption of manners, of the great mass of the mediæval clergy.\r\nNothing can be more amusing than the satire which some of these pieces\r\nthrow on the character of monkish Latin. I printed in the \"Reliquæ\r\nAntiquæ,\" under the title of \"The Abbot of Gloucester's Feast,\" a\r\ncomplaint supposed to issue from the mouth of one of the common herd\r\nof the monks, against the selfishness of their superiors, in which all\r\nthe rules of Latin grammar are entirely set at defiance. The abbot and\r\nprior of Gloucester, with their whole convent, are invited to a feast,\r\nand on their arrival, \"the abbot,\" says the complainant, \"goes to sit\r\nat the top, and the prior next to him, but I stood always in the back\r\nplace among the low people.\"\r\n\r\n              _Abbas ire sede sursum,\r\n              Et prioris juxta ipsum;\r\n              Ego semper stavi dorsum\r\n                            inter rascalilia._\r\n\r\nThe wine was served liberally to the prior and the abbot, but \"nothing\r\nwas give to us poor folks--everything was for the rich.\"\r\n\r\n              _Vinum venit sanguinatis\r\n              Ad prioris et abbatis;\r\n              Nihil nobis paupertatis,\r\n                            sed ad dives omnia._\r\n\r\nWhen some dissatisfaction was displayed by the poor monks, which the\r\ngreat men treated with contempt, \"said the prior to the abbot, 'They\r\nhave wine enough; will you give all our drink to the poor? What does\r\ntheir poverty regard us? they have little, and that is enough, since\r\nthey came uninvited to our feast.'\"\r\n\r\n              _Prior dixit ad abbatis,\r\n              'Ipsi habent vinum satis;\r\n              Vultis dare paupertatis\r\n                            noster potus omnia?\r\n              Quid nos spectat paupertatis?\r\n              Postquam venit non vocatis\r\n                            ad noster convivia.'_\r\n\r\nThus through several pages this amusing poem goes on to describe the\r\ngluttony and drunkenness of the abbot and prior, and the ill-treatment\r\nof their inferiors. This composition belongs to the close of the\r\nthirteenth century. A song very similar to it in character, but much\r\nshorter, is found in a manuscript of the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and printed with the other contents of this manuscript in a\r\nlittle volume issued by the Percy Society.[58] The writer complains\r\nthat the abbot and prior drunk good and high-flavoured wine, while\r\nnothing but inferior stuff was usually given to the convent; \"But,\"\r\nhe says, \"it is better to go drink good wine at the tavern, where the\r\nwines are of the best quality, and money is the butler.\"\r\n\r\n              _Bonum vinum cum sapore\r\n              Bibit abbas cum priore;\r\n              Sed conventus de pejore\r\n                          semper solet bibere.\r\n              Bonum vinum in taberna,\r\n              Ubi vina sunt valarna_ (for Falerna),\r\n              _Ubi nummus est pincerna,\r\n                          Ibi prodest bibere._\r\n\r\n [58] \"Songs and Carols, now first printed from a Manuscript of the\r\n      Fifteenth Century.\" Edited by Thomas Wright, Esq. 8vo., London,\r\n      1847, p. 2.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 111. Caricature upon the Jews at Norwich._]\r\n\r\nPartly out of the earnest, though playful, satire described in this\r\nchapter, arose political satire, and at a later period political\r\ncaricature. I have before remarked that the period we call the middle\r\nages was not that of political or personal caricature, because it\r\nwanted that means of circulating quickly and largely which is necessary\r\nfor it. Yet, no doubt, men who could draw, did, in the middle ages,\r\nsometimes amuse themselves in sketching caricatures, which, in general,\r\nhave perished, because nobody cared to preserve them; but the fact of\r\nthe existence of such works is proved by a very curious example, which\r\nhas been preserved, and which is copied in our cut No. 111. It is a\r\ncaricature on the Jews of Norwich, which some one of the clerks of the\r\nking's courts in the thirteenth century has drawn with a pen, on one\r\nof the official rolls of the Pell office, where it has been preserved.\r\nNorwich, as it is well known, was one of the principal seats of the\r\nJews in England at this early period, and Isaac of Norwich, the crowned\r\nJew with three faces, who towers over the other figures, was no doubt\r\nsome personage of great importance among them. Dagon, as a two-headed\r\ndemon, occupies a tower, which a party of demon knights is attacking.\r\nBeneath the figure of Isaac there is a lady, whose name appears to be\r\nAvezarden, who has some relation or other with a male figure named\r\nNolle-Mokke, in which another demon, named Colbif, is interfering. As\r\nthis latter name is written in capital letters, we may perhaps conclude\r\nthat he is the most important personage in the scene; but, without any\r\nknowledge of the circumstances to which it relates, it would be in vain\r\nto attempt to explain this curious and rather elaborate caricature.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 112. An Irishman._]\r\n\r\nSimilar attempts at caricature, though less direct and elaborate, are\r\nfound in others of our national records. One of these, pointed out to\r\nme by an excellent and respected friend, the Rev. Lambert B. Larking,\r\nis peculiarly interesting, as well as amusing. It belongs to the\r\nTreasury of the Exchequer, and consists of two volumes of vellum called\r\nLiber A and Liber B, forming a register of treaties, marriages, and\r\nsimilar documents of the reign of Edward I., which have been very fully\r\nused by Rymer. The clerk who was employed in writing it, seems to have\r\nbeen, like many of these official clerks, somewhat of a wag, and he\r\nhas amused himself by drawing in the margin figures of the inhabitants\r\nof the provinces of Edward's crown to which the documents referred.\r\nSome of these are evidently designed for caricature. Thus, the figure\r\ngiven in our cut No. 112 was intended to represent an Irishman. One\r\ntrait, at least, in this caricature is well known from the description\r\ngiven by Giraldus Cambrensis, who speaks with a sort of horror of the\r\nformidable axes which the Irish were accustomed to carry about with\r\nthem. In treating of the manner in which Ireland ought to be governed\r\nwhen it had been entirely reduced to subjection, he recommends that,\r\n\"in the meantime, they ought not to be allowed in time of peace, on\r\nany pretence or in any place, to use that detestable instrument of\r\ndestruction, which, by an ancient but accursed custom, they constantly\r\ncarry in their hands instead of a staff.\" In a chapter of his\r\n\"Topography of Ireland,\" Giraldus treats of this \"ancient and wicked\r\ncustom\" of always carrying in their hand an axe, instead of a staff,\r\nto the danger of all persons who had any relations with them. Another\r\nIrishman, from a drawing in the same manuscript, given in our cut No.\r\n113, carries his axe in the same threatening attitude. The costume of\r\nthese figures answers with sufficient accuracy to the description given\r\nby Giraldus Cambrensis. The drawings exhibit more exactly than that\r\nwriter's description the \"small close-fitting hoods, hanging a cubit's\r\nlength (half-a-yard) below the shoulders,\" which, he tells us, they\r\nwere accustomed to wear. This small hood, with the flat cap attached to\r\nit, is shown better perhaps in the second figure than in the first. The\r\n\"breeches and hose of one piece, or hose and breeches joined together,\"\r\nare also exhibited here very distinctly, and appear to be tied over\r\nthe heel, but the feet are clearly naked, and evidently the use of the\r\n\"brogues\" was not yet general among the Irish of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 113. Another Irishman._]\r\n\r\nIf the Welshman of this period was somewhat more scantily clothed\r\nthan the Irishman, he had the advantage of him, to judge by this\r\nmanuscript, in wearing at least one shoe. Our cut No. 114, taken from\r\nit, represents a Welshman armed with bow and arrow, whose clothing\r\nconsists apparently only of a plain tunic and a light mantle. This\r\nis quite in accordance with the description by Giraldus Cambrensis,\r\nwho tells us that in all seasons their dress was the same, and that,\r\nhowever severe the weather, \"they defended themselves from the cold\r\nonly by a thin cloak and tunic.\" Giraldus says nothing of the practice\r\nof the Welsh in wearing but one shoe, yet it is evident that at the\r\ntime of this record that was their practice, for in another figure of\r\na Welshman, given in our cut No. 115, we see the same peculiarity,\r\nand in both cases the shoe is worn on the left foot. Giraldus merely\r\nsays that the Welshmen in general, when engaged in warfare, \"either\r\nwalked bare-footed, or made use of high shoes, roughly made of untanned\r\nleather.\" He describes them as armed sometimes with bows and arrows,\r\nand sometimes with long spears; and accordingly our first example of\r\na Welshman from this manuscript is using the bow, while the second\r\ncarries the spear, which he apparently rests on the single shoe of\r\nhis left foot, while he brandishes a sword in his left hand. Both our\r\nWelshmen present a singularly grotesque appearance.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 114. A Welsh Archer._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 115. A Welshman with his Spear._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 116. A Gascon at his Vine._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 117. The Wine Manufacturer._]\r\n\r\nThe Gascon is represented with more peaceful attributes. Gascony was\r\nthe country of vineyards, from whence we drew our great supply of\r\nwines, a very important article of consumption in the middle ages.\r\nWhen the official clerk who wrote this manuscript came to documents\r\nrelating to Gascony, his thoughts wandered naturally enough to its\r\nrich vineyards and the wine they supplied so plentifully, and to\r\nwhich, according to old reports, clerks seldom showed any dislike, and\r\naccordingly, in the sketch, which we copy in our cut No. 116, we have\r\na Gascon occupied diligently in pruning his vine-tree. He, at least,\r\nwears two shoes, though his clothing is of the lightest description. He\r\nis perhaps the _vinitor_ of the mediæval documents on this subject, a\r\nserf attached to the vineyard. Our second sketch, cut No. 117, presents\r\na more enlarged scene, and introduces us to the whole process of making\r\nwine. First we see a man better clothed, with shoes (or boots) of much\r\nsuperior make, and a hat on his head, carrying away the grapes from\r\nthe vineyard to the place where another man, with no clothing at all,\r\nis treading out the juice in a large vat. This is still in some of the\r\nwine countries the common method of extracting the juice from the\r\ngrape. Further to the left is the large cask in which the juice is put\r\nwhen turned into wine.\r\n\r\nSatires on the people of particular localities were not uncommon\r\nduring the middle ages, because local rivalries and consequent local\r\nfeuds prevailed everywhere. The records of such feuds were naturally\r\nof a temporary character, and perished when the feuds and rivalries\r\nthemselves ceased to exist, but a few curious satires of this kind have\r\nbeen preserved. A monk of Peterborough, who lived late in the twelfth\r\nor early in the thirteenth century, and for some reason or other\r\nnourished an unfriendly feeling to the people of Norfolk, gave vent\r\nto his hostility in a short Latin poem in what we may call goliardic\r\nverse. He begins by abusing the county itself, which, he says, was as\r\nbad and unfruitful as its inhabitants were vile; and he suggests that\r\nthe evil one, when he fled from the anger of the Almighty, had passed\r\nthrough it and left his pollution upon it. Among other anecdotes of\r\nthe simplicity and folly of the people of this county, which closely\r\nresemble the stories of the wise men of Gotham of a later date, he\r\ninforms us that one day the peasantry of one district were so grieved\r\nby the oppressions of their feudal lord, that they subscribed together\r\nand bought their freedom, which he secured to them by formal deed,\r\nratified with a ponderous seal. They adjourned to the tavern, and\r\ncelebrated their deliverance by feasting and drinking until night came\r\non, and then, for want of a candle, they agreed to burn the wax of the\r\nseal. Next day their former lord, informed of what had taken place,\r\nbrought them before a court, where the deed was judged to be void for\r\nwant of the seal, and they lost all their money, were reduced to their\r\nold position of slavery, and treated worse than ever. Other stories,\r\nstill more ridiculous, are told of these old Norfolkians, but few of\r\nthem are worth repeating. Another monk, apparently, who calls himself\r\nJohn de St. Omer, took up the cudgels for the people of Norfolk,\r\nand replied to the Peterborough satirist in similar language.[59] I\r\nhave printed in another collection,[60] a satirical poem against\r\nthe people of a place called Stockton (perhaps Stockton-on-Tees in\r\nDurham), by the monk of a monastic house, of which they were serfs.\r\nIt appeared that they had risen against the tyranny of their lord,\r\nbut had been unsuccessful in defending their cause in a court of law,\r\nand the ecclesiastical satirist exults over their defeat in a very\r\nuncharitable tone. There will be found in the \"Reliquæ Antiquæ,\"[61]\r\na very curious satire in Latin prose directed against the inhabitants\r\nof Rochester, although it is in truth aimed against Englishmen in\r\ngeneral, and is entitled in the manuscript, which is of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, \"Proprietates Anglicorum\" (the Peculiarities of Englishmen).\r\nIn the first place, we are told, that the people of Rochester had\r\ntails, and the question is discussed, very scholastically, what\r\nspecies of animals these Rocestrians were. We are then told that the\r\ncause of their deformity arose from the insolent manner in which\r\nthey treated St. Augustine, when he came to preach the Gospel to the\r\nheathen English. After visiting many parts of England, the saint came\r\nto Rochester, where the people, instead of listening to him, hooted\r\nat him through the streets, and, in derision, attached tails of pigs\r\nand calves to his vestments, and so turned him out of the city. The\r\nvengeance of Heaven came upon them, and all who inhabited the city and\r\nthe country round it, and their descendants after them, were condemned\r\nto bear tails exactly like those of pigs. This story of the tails\r\nwas not an invention of the author of the satire, but was a popular\r\nlegend connected with the history of St. Augustine's preaching, though\r\nthe scene of the legend was laid in Dorsetshire. The writer of this\r\nsingular composition goes on to describe the people of Rochester as\r\nseducers of other people, as men without gratitude, and as traitors.\r\nHe proceeds to show that Rochester being situated in England, its\r\nvices had tainted the whole nation, and he illustrates the baseness of\r\nthe English character by a number of anecdotes of worse than doubtful\r\nauthenticity. It is, in fact, a satire on the English composed in\r\nFrance, and leads us into the domains of political satire.\r\n\r\n [59] Both these poems are printed in my \"Early Mysteries, and other\r\n      Latin Poems of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries.\" 8vo.,\r\n      London, 1838.\r\n\r\n [60] \"Anecdota Literaria,\" p. 49.\r\n\r\n [61] \"Reliquæ Antiquæ,\" vol. ii. p. 230.\r\n\r\nPolitical satire in the middle ages appeared chiefly in the form of\r\npoetry and song, and it was especially in England that it flourished,\r\na sure sign that there was in our country a more advanced feeling of\r\npopular independence, and greater freedom of speech, than in France or\r\nGermany.[62] M. Leroux de Lincy, who undertook to make a collection\r\nof this poetry for France, found so little during the mediæval period\r\nthat came under the character of political, that he was obliged to\r\nsubstitute the word \"historical\" in the title of his book.[63] Where\r\nfeudalism was supreme, indeed, the songs which arose out of private\r\nor public strife, which then were almost inseparable from society,\r\ncontained no political sentiment, but consisted chiefly of personal\r\nattacks on the opponents of those who employed them. Such are the four\r\nshort songs written in the time of the revolt of the French during\r\nthe minority of St. Louis, which commenced in 1226; they are all of a\r\npolitical character which M. Leroux de Lincy has been able to collect\r\nprevious to the year 1270, and they consist merely of personal taunts\r\nagainst the courtiers by the dissatisfied barons who were out of power.\r\nWe trace a similar feeling in some of the popular records of our\r\nbaronial wars of the reign of Henry III., especially in a song, in the\r\nbaronial language (Anglo-Norman), preserved in a small roll of vellum,\r\nwhich appears to have belonged to the minstrel who chanted it in the\r\nhalls of the partisans of Simon de Montfort. The fragment which remains\r\nconsists of stanzas in praise of the leaders of the popular party, and\r\nin reproach of their opponents. Thus of Roger de Clifford, one of earl\r\nSimon's friends, we are told that \"the good Roger de Clifford behaved\r\nlike a noble baron, and exercised great justice; he suffered none,\r\neither small or great, or secretly or openly, to do any wrong.\"\r\n\r\n              _Et de Cliffort ly bon Roger\r\n              Se contint cum noble ber,\r\n                    Si fu de grant justice;\r\n              Ne suffri pas petit ne grant,\r\n              Ne arère ne par devant,\r\n                    Fere nul mesprise._\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one of Montfort's opponents, the bishop of Hereford,\r\nis treated rather contemptuously. We are told that he \"learnt well that\r\nthe earl was strong when he took the matter in hand; before that he\r\n(the bishop) was very fierce, and thought to eat up all the English;\r\nbut now he is reduced to straits.\"\r\n\r\n              _Ly eveske de Herefort\r\n              Sout bien que ly quens fu fort,\r\n                    Kant il prist l'affère;\r\n              Devant ce esteit mult fer,\r\n              Les Englais quida touz manger,\r\n                    Mès ore ne set que fere._\r\n\r\nThis bishop was Peter de Aigueblanche, one of the foreign favourites,\r\nwho had been intruded into the see of Hereford, to the exclusion of\r\na better man, and had been an oppressor of those who were under his\r\nrule. The barons seized him, threw him into prison, and plundered his\r\npossessions, and at the time this song was written, he was suffering\r\nunder the imprisonment which appears to have shortened his life.\r\n\r\n [62] I have published from the original manuscripts the mass of the\r\n      political poetry composed in England during the middle ages in my\r\n      three volumes--\"The Political Songs of England, from the Reign\r\n      of John to that of Edward II.\" 4to., London, 1839 (issued by\r\n      the Camden Society); and \"Political Poems and Songs relating to\r\n      English History, composed during the Period from the Accession of\r\n      Edward III. to that of Richard III.\" 8vo., vol i., London, 1859;\r\n      vol. ii., 1861 (published by the Treasury, under the direction of\r\n      the Master of the Rolls.)\r\n\r\n [63] \"Receuil de Chants Historiques Français depuis le xii^e. jusqu'au\r\n      xviii^e.

Première Série, xii^e.,\r\n      xiii^e., xiv^e, et xv^e., Siècles.\" 8vo., Paris, 1841.\r\n\r\nThe universities and the clerical body in general were deeply involved\r\nin these political movements of the thirteenth century; and our\r\nearliest political songs now known are composed in Latin, and in that\r\nform and style of verse which seems to have been peculiar to the\r\ngoliards, and which I venture to call goliardic. Such is a song against\r\nthe three bishops who supported king John in his quarrel with the\r\npope about the presentation to the see of Canterbury, printed in my\r\nPolitical Songs. Such, too, is the song of the Welsh, and one or two\r\nothers, in the same volume. And such, above all, is that remarkable\r\nLatin poem in which a partisan of the barons, immediately after the\r\nvictory at Lewes, set forth the political tenets of his party, and gave\r\nthe principles of English liberty nearly the same broad basis on which\r\nthey stand at the present. It is an evidence of the extent to which\r\nthese principles were now acknowledged, that in this great baronial\r\nstruggle our political songs began to be written in the English\r\nlanguage, an acknowledgment that they concerned the whole English\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWe trace little of this class of literature during the reign of Edward\r\nI.; but, when the popular feelings became turbulent again under the\r\nreign of his son and successor, political songs became more abundant,\r\nand their satire was directed more even than formerly against measures\r\nand principles, and was less an instrument of mere personal abuse. One\r\nsatirical poem of this period, which I had printed from an imperfect\r\ncopy in a manuscript at Edinburgh, but of which a more complete copy\r\nwas subsequently found in a manuscript in the library of St. Peter's\r\nCollege, Cambridge,[64] is extremely curious as being the earliest\r\nsatire of this kind written in English that we possess. It appears to\r\nhave been written in the year 1320. The writer of this poem begins by\r\ntelling us that his object is to explain the cause of the war, ruin,\r\nand manslaughter which then prevailed throughout the land, and why\r\nthe poor were suffering from hunger and want, the cattle perished in\r\nthe field, and the corn was dear. These he ascribes to the increasing\r\nwickedness of all orders of society. To begin with the church, Rome\r\nwas the head of all corruptions, at the papal court false-hood and\r\ntreachery only reigned, and the door of the pope's palace was shut\r\nagainst truth. During the twelfth and following centuries these\r\ncomplaints, in terms more or less forcible, against the corruptions of\r\nRome, are continually repeated, and show that the evil must have been\r\none under which everybody felt oppressed. The old charge of Romish\r\nsimony is repeated in this poem in very strong terms. \"The clerk's\r\nvoice shall be little heard at the court of Rome, were he ever so good,\r\nunless he bring silver with him; though he were the holiest man that\r\never was born, unless he bring gold or silver, all his time and anxiety\r\nare lost. Alas! why love they so much that which is perishable?\"\r\n\r\n    _Voys of clerk shall lytyl be heard at the court of Rome,\r\n    Were he never so gode a clerk, without silver and he come;\r\n    Though he were the holyst man that ever yet was ibore,\r\n    But he bryng gold or sylver, al hys while is forlore\r\n                              And his thowght.\r\n    Allas! whi love thei that so much that schal turne to nowght?_\r\n\r\n [64] \"A Poem on the Times of Edward III., from a MS. preserved in the\r\n      Library of St. Peter's College, Cambridge.\" Edited by the Rev.\r\n      C. Hardwick. 8vo. London, 1849. (One of the publications of the\r\n      Percy Society.)\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, a wicked man presented himself at the pope's\r\ncourt, he had only to carry plenty of money thither, and all went well\r\nwith him. According to our satirist, the bishops were \"fools,\" and the\r\nother dignitaries and officials of the church were influenced chiefly\r\nby the love of money and self-indulgence. The parson began humbly, when\r\nhe first obtained his benefice, but no sooner had he gathered money\r\ntogether, than he took \"a wenche\" to live with him as his wife, and\r\nrode a hunting with hawks and hounds like a gentleman. The priests were\r\nmen with no learning, who preached by rote what they neither understood\r\nnor appreciated. \"Truely,\" he says, \"it fares by our unlearned priests\r\nas by a jay in a cage, who curses himself: he speaks good English, but\r\nhe knows not what it means. No more does an unlearned priest know his\r\ngospel that he reads daily. An unlearned priest, then, is no better\r\nthan a jay.\"\r\n\r\n        _Certes at so hyt fareth by a prest that is lewed,\r\n        As by a jay in a cage that hymself hath beshrewed:\r\n        Gode Englysh he speketh, but he not never what.\r\n        No more wot a lewed prest hys gospel wat he rat\r\n                            By day.\r\n        Than is a lewed prest no better than a jay._\r\n\r\nAbbots and priors were remarkable chiefly for their pride and luxury,\r\nand the monks naturally followed their examples. Thus was religion\r\ndebased everywhere. The character of the physician is treated with\r\nequal severity, and his various tricks to obtain money are amusingly\r\ndescribed. In this manner the songster presents to view the failings of\r\nthe various orders of lay society also, the selfishness and oppressive\r\nbearing of the knights and aristocracy, and their extravagance in\r\ndress and living, the neglect of justice, the ill-management of the\r\nwars, the weight of taxation, and all the other evils which then\r\nafflicted the state. This poem marks a period in our social history,\r\nand led the way to that larger work of the same character, which\r\ncame about thirty years later, the well-known \"Visions of Piers\r\nPloughman,\"[65] one of the most remarkable satires, as well as one of\r\nthe most remarkable poems, in the English language.\r\n\r\nWe will do no more than glance at the further progress of political\r\nsatire which had now taken a permanent footing in English literature.\r\nWe see less of it during the reign of Edward III., the greater part of\r\nwhich was occupied with foreign wars and triumphs, but there appeared\r\ntowards the close of his reign, a very remarkable satire, which I have\r\nprinted in my \"Political Poems and Songs.\" It is written in Latin, and\r\nconsists of a pretended prophecy in verse by an inspired monk named\r\nJohn of Bridlington, with a mock commentary in prose--in fact, a parody\r\non the commentaries in which the scholastics of that age displayed\r\ntheir learning, but in this case the commentary contains a bold though\r\nto us rather obscure criticism on the whole policy of Edward's reign.\r\nThe reign of Richard II. was convulsed by the great struggle for\r\nreligious reform, by the insurrections of the lower orders, and by\r\nthe ambition and feuds of the nobles, and produced a vast quantity of\r\npolitical and religious satire, both in prose and verse, but especially\r\nthe latter. We must not overlook our great poet Chaucer, as one of the\r\npowerful satirists of this period. Political song next makes itself\r\nheard loudly in the wars of the Roses. It was the last struggle of\r\nfeudalism in England, and the character of the song had fallen back\r\nto its earlier characteristics, in which all patriotic feelings were\r\nabandoned to make place for personal hatred.\r\n\r\n [65] \"The Vision and the Creed of Piers Ploughman;\" with Notes and a\r\n      Glossary by Thomas Wright. 2 vols. 12mo.

They belonged generally to a low class of the population,\r\none that was hardly acknowledged by the law, which merely administered\r\nto the pleasures and amusements of others, and, though sometimes\r\nliberally rewarded, they were objects rather of contempt than of\r\nrespect. Of course there were minstrels belonging to a class more\r\nrespectable than the others, but these were comparatively few; and the\r\nordinary minstrel seems to have been simply an unprincipled vagabond,\r\nwho hardly possessed any settled resting-place, who wandered about from\r\nplace to place, and was not too nice as to the means by which he gained\r\nhis living--perhaps fairly represented by the street minstrel, or\r\nmountebank, of the present day. One of his talents was that of mocking\r\nand ridiculing others, and it is not to be wondered at, therefore, if\r\nhe sometimes became an object of mockery and ridicule himself. One of\r\nthe well-known minstrels of the thirteenth century, Rutebeuf, was, like\r\nmany of his fellows, a poet also, and he has left several short pieces\r\nof verse descriptive of himself and of his own mode of life. In one\r\nof these he complains of his poverty, and tells us that the world had\r\nin his time--the reign of St. Louis--become so degenerate, that few\r\npeople gave anything to the unfortunate minstrel. According to his own\r\naccount, he was without food, and in a fair way towards starvation,\r\nexposed to the cold without sufficient clothing, and with nothing but\r\nstraw for his bed.\r\n\r\n        _Je touz de froit, de fain baaille,\r\n        Dont je suis mors et maubailliz,\r\n        Je suis sanz coutes et sans liz;\r\n        N'a si povre jusqu'à Senliz.\r\n        Sire, si ne sai quel part aille;\r\n        Mes costeiz connoit le pailliz,\r\n        Et liz de paille n'est pas liz,\r\n        Et en mon lit n'a fors la paille._\r\n                          --Œuvres de Rutebeuf, vol. i. p. 3.\r\n\r\nIn another poem, Rutebeuf laments that he has rendered his condition\r\nstill more miserable by marrying, when he had not wherewith to keep\r\na wife and family. In a third, he complains that in the midst of his\r\npoverty, his wife has brought him a child to increase his domestic\r\nexpenses, while his horse, on which he was accustomed to travel to\r\nplaces where he might exercise his profession, had broken its leg, and\r\nhis nurse was dunning him for money. In addition to all these causes of\r\ngrief, he had lost the use of one of his eyes.\r\n\r\n              _Or a d'enfant géu ma fame;\r\n              Mon cheval a brisié la jame\r\n                    A une lice;\r\n              Or veut de l'argent ma norrice,\r\n              Qui m'en destraint et me pélice,\r\n                  For l'enfant pestre._\r\n\r\nThroughout his complaint, although he laments over the decline of\r\nliberality among his contemporaries, he nevertheless turns his poverty\r\ninto a joke. In several other pieces of verse he speaks in the same\r\nway, half joking and half lamenting over his condition, and he does not\r\nconceal that the love of gambling was one of the causes of it. \"The\r\ndice,\" he says, \"have stripped me entirely of my robe; the dice watch\r\nand spy me; it is these which kill me; they assault and ruin me, to my\r\ngrief.\"\r\n\r\n              _Li dé que li détier ont fet,\r\n              M'ont de ma robe tout desfet;\r\n                    Li dé m'ocient.\r\n              Li dé m'aguetent et espient;\r\n              Li dé m'assaillent et dessient,\r\n                    Ce poise moi._--Ib., vol. i. p. 27.\r\n\r\nAnd elsewhere he intimates that what the minstrels sometimes gained\r\nfrom the lavish generosity of their hearers, soon passed away at the\r\ntavern in dice and drinking.\r\n\r\nOne of Rutebeuf's contemporaries in the same profession, Colin Muset,\r\nindulges in similar complaints, and speaks bitterly of the want of\r\ngenerosity displayed by the great barons of his time. In addressing one\r\nof them who had treated him ungenerously, he says, \"Sir Count, I have\r\nfiddled before you in your hostel, and you neither gave me a gift, nor\r\npaid me my wages. It is discreditable behaviour. By the duty I owe to\r\nSt. Mary, I cannot continue in your service at this rate. My purse is\r\nill furnished, and my wallet is empty.\"\r\n\r\n              _Sire quens, j'ai vielé\r\n              Devant vos en vostre ostel;\r\n              Si ne m'avez riens donné,\r\n              Ne mes gages acquitez,\r\n                  C'est vilanie.\r\n              Foi que doi sainte Marie,\r\n              Ensi ne vos sieurré-je mie.\r\n              M'aumosnière est mal garnie,\r\n              Et ma male mal farsie._\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to state that when he went home to his wife (for Colin\r\nMuset also was a married minstrel), he was ill received if his purse\r\nand wallet were empty; but it was very different when they were full.\r\nHis wife then sprang forward and threw her arms round his neck; she\r\ntook his wallet from his horse with alacrity, while his lad conducted\r\nthe animal cheerfully to the stable, and his maiden killed a couple of\r\ncapons, and prepared them with piquant sauce. His daughter brought a\r\ncomb for his hair. \"Then,\" he exclaims, \"I am master in my own house.\"\r\n\r\n              _Ma fame va destroser\r\n              Ma male sans demorer;\r\n              Mon garçon va abuvrer\r\n              Men cheval et conreer;\r\n              Ma pucele va tuer\r\n                  Deux chapons por deporter\r\n              A la sause aillie.\r\n              Ma fille m'aporte un pigne\r\n              En sa main par cortoisie.\r\n              Lors sui de mon ostel sire._\r\n\r\nWhen the minstrels could thus joke upon themselves, we need not be\r\nsurprised if they satirised one another. In a poem of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, entitled \"Les deux Troveors Ribauz,\" two minstrels are\r\nintroduced on the stage abusing and insulting one another, and while\r\nindulging in mutual accusations of ignorance in their art, they display\r\ntheir ignorance at the same time by misquoting the titles of the poems\r\nwhich they profess to be able to recite. One of them boasts of the\r\nvariety of instruments on which he could perform:--\r\n\r\n              _Je suis jugleres de viele,\r\n              Si sai de muse et frestele,\r\n              Et de harpes et de chifonie,\r\n              De la gigue, de l'armonie,\r\n              De l'salteire, et en la rote\r\n              Sai-ge bien chanter une note._\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that among all these instruments, the viol, or\r\nfiddle, was the one most generally in use.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 118. A Charming Fiddler._]\r\n\r\nThe mediæval monuments of art abound with burlesques and satires on the\r\nminstrels, whose instruments of music are placed in the hands sometimes\r\nof monsters, and at others in those of animals of a not very refined\r\ncharacter. Our cut No. 118 is taken from a manuscript in the British\r\nMuseum (MS. Cotton, Domitian A. ii.), and represents a female minstrel\r\nplaying on the fiddle; she has the upper part of a lady, and the lower\r\nparts of a mare, a combination which appears to have been rather\r\nfamiliar to the imagination of the mediæval artists. In our cut No.\r\n119, which is taken from a copy made by Carter of one of the misereres\r\nin Ely Cathedral, it is not quite clear whether the performer on the\r\nfiddle be a monster or merely a cripple; but perhaps the latter was\r\nintended. The instrument, too, assumes a rather singular form. Our cut\r\nNo. 120, also taken from Carter, was furnished by a sculpture in the\r\nchurch of St. John, at Cirencester, and represents a man performing on\r\nan instrument rather closely resembling the modern hurdy-gurdy, which\r\nis evidently played by turning a handle, and the music is produced by\r\nstriking wires or strings inside. The face is evidently intended to be\r\nthat of a jovial companion.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 119. A Crippled Minstrel._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 120. The Hurdy-Gurdy._]\r\n\r\nGluttony was an especial characteristic of that class of society to\r\nwhich the minstrel belonged, and perhaps this was the idea intended to\r\nbe conveyed in the next picture, No. 121, taken from one of the stalls\r\nin Winchester Cathedral, in which a pig is performing on the fiddle,\r\nand appears to be accompanied by a juvenile of the same species of\r\nanimal. One of the same stalls, copied in our cut No. 122, represents\r\na sow performing on another sort of musical instrument, which is not\r\nat all uncommon in mediæval delineations. It is the double pipe or\r\nflute, which was evidently borrowed from the ancients. Minstrelsy was\r\nthe usual accompaniment of the mediæval meal, and perhaps this picture\r\nis intended to be a burlesque on that circumstance, as the mother is\r\nplaying to her brood while they are feeding. They all seem to listen\r\nquietly, except one, who is evidently much more affected by the music\r\nthan his companions. The same instrument is placed in the hands of a\r\nrather jolly-looking female in one of the sculptures of St. John's\r\nChurch in Cirencester, copied in our cut No. 123.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 121. A Swinish Minstrel._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 122. A Musical Mother._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 123. The Double Flute._]\r\n\r\nAlthough this instrument is rather frequently represented in mediæval\r\nworks of art, we have no account of or allusion to it in mediæval\r\nwriters; and perhaps it was not held in very high estimation, and was\r\nused only by a low class of performers. As in many other things, the\r\nemployment of particular musical instruments was guided, no doubt, by\r\nfashion, new ones coming in as old ones went out. Such was the case\r\nwith the instrument which is named in one of the above extracts, and\r\nin some other mediæval writers, a _chiffonie_, and which has been\r\nsupposed to be the dulcimer, that had fallen into discredit in the\r\nfourteenth century. This instrument is introduced in a story which is\r\nfound in Cuvelier's metrical history of the celebrated warrior Bertrand\r\ndu Gueselin. In the course of the war for the expulsion of Pedro the\r\nCruel from the throne of Castile, an English knight, Sir Matthew\r\nGournay, was sent as a special ambassador to the court of Portugal. The\r\nPortuguese monarch had in his service two minstrels whose performances\r\nhe vaunted greatly, and on whom he let great store, and he insisted\r\non their performing in the presence of the new ambassador. It turned\r\nout that they played on the instrument just mentioned, and Sir Matthew\r\nGournay could not refrain from laughing at the performance. When the\r\nking pressed him to give his opinion, he said, with more regard for\r\ntruth than politeness, \"in France and Normandy, the instruments your\r\nminstrels play upon are regarded with contempt, and are only in use\r\namong beggars and blind people, so that they are popularly called\r\nbeggar's instruments.\" The king, we are told, took great offence at the\r\nbluntness of his English guest.\r\n\r\nThe fiddle itself appears at this time to have been gradually sinking\r\nin credit, and the poets complained that a degraded taste for more\r\nvulgar musical instruments was introducing itself. Among these we\r\nmay mention especially the pipe and tabor. The French antiquary,\r\nM. Jubinal, in a very valuable collection of early popular poetry,\r\npublished under the title of \"Jongleurs et Trouvères,\" has printed\r\na curious poem of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, intended as\r\na protest against the use of the tabor and the bagpipes, which he\r\ncharacterises as properly the musical instruments of the peasantry. Yet\r\npeople then, he says, were becoming so besotted on such instruments,\r\nthat they introduced them in places where better minstrelsy would be\r\nmore suitable. The writer thinks that the introduction of so vulgar an\r\ninstrument as the tabor into grand festivals could be looked upon in\r\nno other light than as one of the signs which might be expected to be\r\nthe precursors of the coming of Antichrist. \"If such people are to come\r\nto grand festivals as carry a bushel [_i.e._ a tabor made in the form\r\nof a bushel measure, on the end of which they beat], and make such a\r\nterrible noise, it would seem that Antichrist must now be being born;\r\npeople ought to break the head of each of them with a staff.\"\r\n\r\n          _Déussent itiels genz venir à bele feste\r\n          Qui portent un boissel, qui mainent tel tempeste,\r\n          Il samble que Antecrist doie maintenant nestre;\r\n          L'en duroit d'un baston chascun brisier la teste._\r\n\r\nThis satirist adds, as a proof of the contempt in which the Virgin Mary\r\nheld such instruments, that she never loved a tabor, or consented to\r\nhear one, and that no tabor was introduced among the minstrelsy at her\r\nespousals. \"The gentle mother of God,\" he says, \"loved the sound of the\r\nfiddle,\" and he goes on to prove her partiality for that instrument by\r\nciting some of her miracles.\r\n\r\n          _Onques le mère Dieu, qui est virge honorée,\r\n          Et est avoec les angles hautement coronée,\r\n          N'ama onques tabour, ne point ne li agrée,\r\n          N'onques tabour n'i ot quant el fu espousée.\r\n          La douce mère Dieu ama son de viele._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 124. The Tabor, or Drum._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 125. Bruin turned Piper._]\r\n\r\nThe artist who carved the curious stalls in Henry VII.'s Chapel at\r\nWestminster, seems to have entered fully into the spirit displayed by\r\nthis satirist, for in one of them, represented in our cut No. 124, he\r\nhas introduced a masked demon playing on the tabor, with an expression\r\napparently of derision. This tabor presents much the form of a bushel\r\nmeasure, or rather, perhaps, of a modern drum. It may be remarked that\r\nthe drum is, in fact, the same instrument as the tabor, or, at least,\r\nis derived from it, and they were called by the same names, _tabor_\r\nor _tambour_. The English name _drum_, which has equivalents in the\r\nlater forms of the Teutonic dialects, perhaps means simply something\r\nwhich makes a noise, and is not, as far as I know, met with before the\r\nsixteenth century. Another carving of the same series of stalls at\r\nWestminster, copied in our cut No. 125, represents a tame bear playing\r\non the bagpipes. This is perhaps intended to be at the same time a\r\nsatire on the instrument itself, and upon the strange exhibitions of\r\nanimals domesticated and taught various singular performances, which\r\nwere then so popular.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 126. Royal Minstrelsy._]\r\n\r\nIn our cut No. 126 we come to the fiddle again, which long sustained\r\nits place in the highest rank of musical instruments. It is taken\r\nfrom one of the sculptures on the porch of the principal entrance to\r\nthe Cathedral of Lyons in France, and represents a mermaid with her\r\nchild, listening to the music of the fiddle. She wears a crown, and\r\nis intended, no doubt, to be one of the queens of the sea, and the\r\nintroduction of the fiddle under such circumstances can leave no doubt\r\nhow highly it was esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe mermaid is a creature of the imagination, which appears to have\r\nbeen at all times a favourite object of poetry and legend. It holds\r\nan important place in the mediæval bestiaries, or popular treatises\r\non natural history, and it has only been expelled from the domains of\r\nscience at a comparatively recent date. It still retains its place in\r\npopular legends of our sea-coasts, and more especially in the remoter\r\nparts of our islands. The stories of the merrow, or Irish fairy, hold a\r\nprominent place among my late friend Crofton Croker's \"Fairy Legends of\r\nthe South of Ireland.\" The mermaid is also introduced not unfrequently\r\nin mediæval sculpture and carving. Our cut No. 127, representing a\r\nmermaid and a merman, is copied from one of the stalls of Winchester\r\nCathedral. The usual attributes of the mermaid are a looking-glass and\r\ncomb, by the aid of which she is dressing her hair; but here she holds\r\nthe comb alone. Her companion, the male, holds a fish, which he appears\r\nto have just caught, in his hand.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 127. Mermaids._]\r\n\r\nWhile, after the fifteenth century the profession of the minstrel\r\nbecame entirely degraded, and he was looked upon more than ever as a\r\nrogue and vagabond, the fiddle accompanied him, and it long remained,\r\nas it still remains in Ireland, the favourite instrument of the\r\npeasantry. The blind fiddler, even at the present day, is not unknown\r\nin our rural districts. It has always been in England the favourite\r\ninstrument of minstrelsy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT FOOL.--THE NORMANS AND THEIR GABS.--EARLY HISTORY OF COURT\r\n     FOOLS.--THEIR COSTUME.--CARVINGS IN THE CORNISH CHURCHES.--THE\r\n     BURLESQUE SOCIETIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES.--THE FEASTS OF ASSES, AND\r\n     OF FOOLS.--THEIR LICENCE.--THE LEADEN MONEY OF THE FOOLS.--THE\r\n     BISHOP'S BLESSING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the employment of minstrels attached to the family, probably arose\r\nanother and well-known character of later times, the court fool, who\r\ntook the place of satirist in the great households. I do not consider\r\nwhat we understand by the court fool to be a character of any great\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat doubtful whether what we call a jest, was really\r\nappreciated in the middle ages. Puns seem to have been considered\r\nas elegant figures of speech in literary composition, and we rarely\r\nmeet with anything like a quick and clever repartee. In the earlier\r\nages, when a party of warriors would be merry, their mirth appears\r\nto have consisted usually in ridiculous boasts, or in rude remarks,\r\nor in sneers at enemies or opponents. These jests were termed by the\r\nFrench and Normans _gabs_ (_gabæ_, in mediæval Latin), a word supposed\r\nto have been derived from the classical Latin word _cavilla_, a mock\r\nor taunt; and a short poem in Anglo-Norman has been preserved which\r\nfurnishes a curious illustration of the meaning attached to it in the\r\ntwelfth century. This poem relates how Charlemagne, piqued by the\r\ntaunts of his empress on the superiority of Hugh the Great, emperor\r\nof Constantinople, went to Constantinople, accompanied by his _douze\r\npairs_ and a thousand knights, to verify the truth of his wife's story.\r\nThey proceeded first to Jerusalem, where, when Charlemagne and his\r\ntwelve peers entered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, they looked so\r\nhandsome and majestic, that they were taken at first for Christ and\r\nhis twelve apostles, but the mystery was soon cleared up, and they were\r\ntreated by the patriarch with great hospitality during four months.\r\nThey then continued their progress till they reached Constantinople,\r\nwhere they were equally well received by the emperor Hugo. At night\r\nthe emperor placed his guests in a chamber furnished with thirteen\r\nsplendid beds, one in the middle of the room, and the other twelve\r\ndistributed around it, and illuminated by a large carbuncle, which gave\r\na light as bright as that of day. When Hugh left them in their quarters\r\nfor the night, he lent them wine and whatever was necessary to make\r\nthem comfortable; and, when alone, they proceeded to amuse themselves\r\nwith _gabs_, or jokes, each being expected to say his joke in his\r\nturn. Charlemagne took the lead, and boasted that if the emperor Hugh\r\nwould place before him his strongest \"bachelor,\" in full armour, and\r\nmounted on his good steed, he would, with one blow of his sword, cut\r\nhim through from the head downwards, and through the saddle and horse,\r\nand that the sword should, after all this, sink into the ground to the\r\nhandle. Charlemagne then called upon Roland for his _gab_, who boasted\r\nthat his breath was so strong, that if the emperor Hugh would lend him\r\nhis horn, he would take it out into the fields and blow it with such\r\nforce, that the wind and noise of it would shake down the whole city of\r\nConstantinople. Oliver, whose turn came next, boasted of exploits of\r\nanother description if he were left alone with the beautiful princess,\r\nHugh's daughter. The rest of the peers indulged in similar boasts, and\r\nwhen the _gabs_ had gone round, they went to sleep. Now the emperor of\r\nConstantinople had very cunningly, and rather treacherously, made a\r\nhole through the wall, by which all that passed inside could be seen\r\nand heard, and he had placed a spy on the outside, who gave a full\r\naccount of the conversation of the distinguished guests to his imperial\r\nmaster. Next morning Hugh called his guests before him, told them what\r\nhe had heard by his spy, and declared that each of them should perform\r\nhis boast, or, if he failed, be put to death. Charlemagne expostulated,\r\nand represented that it was the custom in France when people retired\r\nfor the night to amuse themselves in that manner. \"Such is the custom\r\nin France,\" he said, \"at Paris, and at Chartres, when the French are\r\nin bed they amuse themselves and make jokes, and say things both of\r\nwisdom and of folly.\"\r\n\r\n        _Si est tel custume en France, à Paris e à Cartres,\r\n        Quand Franceis sunt culchiez, que se giuunt e gabent,\r\n        E si dient ambure e saver e folage._\r\n\r\nBut Charlemagne expostulated in vain, and they were only saved from the\r\nconsequence of their imprudence by the intervention of so many miracles\r\nfrom above.[66]\r\n\r\n [66] \"Charlemagne, an Anglo-Norman Poem of the Twelfth Century, now\r\n      first published, by Francisque Michel,\" 12mo., 8vo., London, 1836.\r\n\r\nIn such trials of skill as this, an individual must continually have\r\narisen who excelled in some at least of the qualities needful for\r\nraising mirth and making him a good companion, by showing himself more\r\nbrilliant in wit, or more biting in sarcasms, or more impudent in his\r\njokes, and he would thus become the favourite mirth-maker of the court,\r\nthe boon companion of the chieftain and his followers in their hours of\r\nrelaxation. We find such an individual not unusually introduced in the\r\nearly romances and in the mythology of nations, and he sometimes unites\r\nthe character of court orator with the other. Such a personage was the\r\nSir Kay of the cycle of the romances of king Arthur. I have remarked\r\nin a former chapter that Hunferth, in the Anglo-Saxon poem of Beowulf,\r\nis described as holding a somewhat similar position at the court of\r\nking Hrothgar. To go farther back in the mythology of our forefathers,\r\nthe Loki of Scandinavian fable appears sometimes to have performed a\r\nsimilar character in the assembly of his fellow deities; and we know\r\nthat, among the Greeks, Homer on one occasion introduces Vulcan acting\r\nthe part of joker (γελωτοποιὸς) to the gods of Olympus. But all these\r\nhave no relationship whatever to the court-fool of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe German writer Flögel, in his \"History of Court Fools,\"[67] has\r\nthrown this subject into much confusion by introducing a great mass\r\nof irrelevant matter; and those who have since compiled from Flögel,\r\nhave made the confusion still greater. Much of this confusion has\r\narisen from the misunderstanding and confounding of names and terms.\r\nThe mimus, the joculator, the ministrel, or whatever name this class\r\nof society went by, was not in any respects identical with what we\r\nunderstand by a court fool, nor does any such character as the latter\r\nappear in the feudal household before the fourteenth century, as\r\nfar as we are acquainted with the social manners and customs of the\r\nolden time. The vast extent of the early French _romans de geste_, or\r\nCarlovingian romances, which are filled with pictures of courts both of\r\nprinces and barons, in which the court fool must have been introduced\r\nhad he been known at the time they were composed, that is, in the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries, contains, I believe, no trace of such\r\npersonage; and the same may be said of the numerous other romances,\r\nfabliaux, and in fact all the literature of that period, one so rich in\r\nworks illustrative of contemporary manners in their most minute detail.\r\nFrom these facts I conclude that the single brief charter published\r\nby M. Rigollot from a manuscript in the Imperial Library in Paris,\r\nis either misunderstood or it presents a very exceptional case. By\r\nthis charter, John, king of England, grants to his _follus_, William\r\nPicol, or Piculph (as he is called at the close of the document), an\r\nestate in Normandy named in the document Fons Ossanæ (Menil-Ozenne in\r\nMortain), with all its appurtenances, \"to have and to hold, to him and\r\nto his heirs, by doing there-for to us once a year the service of one\r\n_follus_, as long as he lives; and after his death his heirs shall\r\nhold it of us, by the service of one pair of gilt spurs to be rendered\r\nannually to us.\"[68] The service (_servitium_) here enjoined means the\r\nannual payment of the obligation of the feudal tenure, and therefore\r\nif _follus_ is to be taken as signifying \"a fool,\" it only means that\r\nPicol was to perform that character on one occasion in the course of\r\nthe year. In this case, he may have been some fool whom king John had\r\ntaken into his special favour; but it certainly is no proof that the\r\npractice of keeping court fools then existed. It is not improbable\r\nthat this practice was first introduced in Germany, for Flögel speaks,\r\nthough rather doubtfully, of one who was kept at the court of the\r\nemperor Rudolph I. (of Hapsburg), whose reign lasted from 1273 to 1292.\r\nIt is more certain, however, that the kings of France possessed court\r\nfools before the middle of the fourteenth century, and from this time\r\nanecdotes relating to them begin to be common. One of the earliest\r\nand most curious of these anecdotes, if it be true, relates to the\r\ncelebrated victory of Sluys gained over the French fleet by our king\r\nEdward III. in the year 1340. It is said that no one dared to announce\r\nthis disaster to the French king, Philippe VI., until a court fool\r\nundertook the task. Entering the king's chamber, he continued muttering\r\nto himself, but loud enough to be heard, \"Those cowardly English! the\r\nchicken-hearted Britons!\" \"How so, cousin?\" the king inquired. \"Why,\"\r\nreplied the fool, \"because they have not courage enough to jump into\r\nthe sea, like your French soldiers, who went over headlong from their\r\nships, leaving those to the enemy who showed no inclination to follow\r\nthem.\" Philippe thus became aware of the full extent of his calamity.\r\nThe institution of the court fool was carried to its greatest degree of\r\nperfection during the fifteenth century; it only expired in the age of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\n [67] \"Geschichte der Hofnarren, von Karl Friedrich Flögel,\" 8vo.\r\n      Liegnitz und Leipzig, 1789.\r\n\r\n [68] The words of this charter, as given by Rigollot, are:--\"Joannes,\r\n      D G., etc. Sciatis nos dedisse et præsenti charta confirmasse\r\n      Willelmo Picol, follo nostro, Fontem Ossanæ, cum omnibus\r\n      pertinenciis suis, habendum et tenendum sibi et hæredibus suis,\r\n      faciendo inde nobis annuatim servitium unius folli quoad vixerit;\r\n      et post ejus decessum hæredes sui eam tenebunt, et per servitium\r\n      unius paris calcarium deauratorum nobis annuatim reddendo.\r\n      Quare volumus et firmiter præcipimus quod prædictius Piculphus\r\n      et hæredes sui habeant et teneant in perpetuum, bene et in\r\n      pace, libere et quiete, prædictam terram.\"--Rigollot, Monnaies\r\n      inconnues des Evêques des Innocens, etc., 8vo., Paris, 1837.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently with the court fool that the costume was introduced\r\nwhich has ever since been considered as the characteristic mark of\r\nfolly. Some parts of this costume, at least, appear to have been\r\nborrowed from an earlier date. The _gelotopœi_ of the Greeks, and\r\nthe _mimi_ and _moriones_ of the Romans, shaved their heads; but the\r\ncourt fools perhaps adopted this fashion as a satire upon the clergy\r\nand monks. Some writers professed to doubt whether the fools borrowed\r\nfrom the monks, or the monks from the fools; and Cornelius Agrippa,\r\nin his treatise on the Vanity of Sciences, remarks that the monks had\r\ntheir heads \"all shaven like fools\" (_raso toto capite ut fatui_).\r\nThe cowl, also, was perhaps adopted in derision of the monks, but\r\nit was distinguished by the addition of a pair of asses' ears, or by\r\na cock's head and comb, which formed its termination above, or by\r\nboth. The court fool was also furnished with a staff or club, which\r\nbecame eventually his bauble. The bells were another necessary article\r\nin the equipment of a court fool, perhaps also intended as a satire\r\non the custom of wearing small bells in the dress, which prevailed\r\nlargely during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, especially among\r\npeople who were fond of childish ostentation. The fool wore also a\r\nparty-coloured, or motley, garment, probably with the same aim--that of\r\nsatirising one of the ridiculous fashions of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 127a. Court Fools._]\r\n\r\nIt is in the fifteenth century that we first meet with the fool in\r\nfull costume in the illuminations or manuscripts, and towards the end\r\nof the century this costume appears continually in engravings. It is\r\nalso met with at this time among the sculptures of buildings and the\r\ncarvings of wood-work. The two very interesting examples given in our\r\ncut No. 127a are taken from carvings of the fifteenth century, in the\r\nchurch of St. Levan, in Cornwall, near the Land's End. They represent\r\nthe court fool in two varieties of costume; in the first, the fool's\r\ncowl, or cap, ends in the cock's head; in the other, it is fitted with\r\nasses' ears. There are variations also in other parts of the dress;\r\nfor the second only has bells to his sleeves, and the first carries\r\na singularly formed staff, which may perhaps be intended for a strap\r\nor belt, with a buckle at the end; while the other has a ladle in\r\nhis hand. As one possesses a beard, and presents marks of age in his\r\ncountenance, while the other is beardless and youthful, we may consider\r\nthe pair as an old fool and a young fool.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 128. A Fool and a Grimace-maker._]\r\n\r\nThe Cornish churches are rather celebrated for their early carved\r\nwood-work, chiefly of the fifteenth century, of which two examples\r\nare given in our cut, No. 128, taken from bench pannels in the church\r\nof St. Mullion, on the Cornish coast, a little to the north of the\r\nLizard Point. The first has bells hanging to the sleeves, and is no\r\ndoubt intended to represent folly in some form; the other appears to be\r\nintended for the head of a woman making grimaces.[69]\r\n\r\n [69] For the drawings of these interesting carvings from the Cornish\r\n      churches, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. J. T. Blight, the\r\n      author of an extremely pleasing and useful guide to the beauties\r\n      of a well-known district of Cornwall, entitled \"A Week at the\r\n      Land's End.\"\r\n\r\nThe fool had long been a character among the people before he became a\r\ncourt fool, for Folly--or, as she was then called, \"Mother Folly\"--was\r\none of the favourite objects of popular worship in the middle ages,\r\nand, where that worship sprang up spontaneously among the people,\r\nit grew with more energy, and presented more hearty joyousness and\r\nbolder satire than under the patronage of the great. Our forefathers\r\nin those times were accustomed to form themselves into associations or\r\nsocieties of a mirthful character, parodies of those of a more serious\r\ndescription, especially ecclesiastical, and elected as their officers\r\nmock popes, cardinals, archbishops and bishops, kings, &c. They held\r\nperiodical festivals, riotous and licentious carnivals, which were\r\nadmitted into the churches, and even taken under the especial patronage\r\nof the clergy, under such titles as \"the feast of fools,\" \"the feast of\r\nthe ass,\" \"the feast of the innocents,\" and the like. There was hardly\r\na Continental town of any account which had not its \"company of fools,\"\r\nwith its mock ordinances and mock ceremonies. In our own island we\r\nhad our abbots of misrule and of unreason. At their public festivals\r\nsatirical songs were sung and satirical masks and dresses were worn;\r\nand in many of them, especially at a later date, brief satirical dramas\r\nwere acted. These satires assumed much of the functions of modern\r\ncaricature; the caricature of the pictorial representations, which were\r\nmostly permanent monuments and destined for future generations, was\r\nnaturally general in its character, but in the representations of which\r\nI am speaking, which were temporary, and designed to excite the mirth\r\nof the moment, it became personal, and, often, even political, and it\r\nwas constantly directed against the ecclesiastical order. The scandal\r\nof the day furnished it with abundant materials. A fragment of one of\r\ntheir songs of an early date, sung at one of these \"feasts\" at Rouen,\r\nhas been preserved, and contains the following lines, written in Latin\r\nand French:--\r\n\r\n              _De asino bono nostro,\r\n              Meliori et optimo,\r\n                      Debemus_ faire fête.\r\n              En revenant _de Gravinaria_,\r\n              Un gros chardon _reperit in via_,\r\n                      Il lui coupa la tête.\r\n\r\n              _Vir monachus in mense Julio\r\n              Egressus est e monasterio_,\r\n                      C'est dom de la Bucaille;\r\n              _Egressus est sine licentia_,\r\n              Pour aller voir dona Venissia,\r\n                      Et faire la ripaille.\r\n\r\n                   TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n              _For our good ass,\r\n              The better and the best,\r\n                      We ought to rejoice.\r\n              In returning from Gravinière,\r\n              A great thistle he found in the way,\r\n                      He cut off its head._\r\n\r\n              _A monk in the month of July\r\n              Went out of his monastery,\r\n                      It is dom de la Bucaille;\r\n              He went out without license,\r\n              To pay a visit to the dame de Venisse,\r\n                      And make jovial cheer._\r\n\r\nIt appears that De la Bucaille was the prior of the abbey of St.\r\nTaurin, at Rouen, and that the dame de Venisse was prioress of St.\r\nSaviour, and these lines, no doubt, commemorate some great scandal of\r\nthe day relating to the private relations between these two individuals.\r\n\r\nThese mock religious ceremonies are supposed to have been derived from\r\nthe Roman Saturnalia; they were evidently of great antiquity in the\r\nmediæval church, and were most prevalent in France and Italy. Under the\r\nname of \"the feast of the sub-deacons\" they are forbidden by the acts\r\nof the council of Toledo, in 633; at a later period, the French punned\r\non the word _sous-diacres_, and called them _Saouls-diacres_ (Drunken\r\nDeacons), words which had nearly the same sound. The \"feast of the\r\nass\" is said to be traced back in France as far as the ninth century.\r\nIt was celebrated in most of the great towns in that country, such as\r\nRouen, Sens, Douai, &c., and the service for the occasion is actually\r\npreserved in some of the old church books. From this it appears that\r\nthe ass was led in procession to a place in the middle of the church,\r\nwhich had been decked out to receive it, and that the procession was\r\nled by two clerks, who sung a Latin song in praise of the animal. This\r\nsong commences by telling us how \"the ass came from the east, handsome\r\nand very strong, and most fit for carrying burthens\":--\r\n\r\n                    _Orientis partibus\r\n                    Adventavit asinus,\r\n                    Pulcher et fortissimus,\r\n                    Sarcinis aptissimus._\r\n\r\nThe refrain or burthen of the song is in French, and exhorts the animal\r\nto join in the uproar--\"Eh! sir ass, chant now, fair mouth, bray, you\r\nshall have hay enough, and oats in abundance:\"--\r\n\r\n                    _Hez, sire asnes, car chantez,\r\n                    Belle bouche, rechignez,\r\n                    Vous aurez du foin assez,\r\n                    Et de l'avoine à plantez._\r\n\r\nIn this tone the chant continues through nine similar stanzas,\r\ndescribing the mode of life and food of the ass. When the procession\r\nreached the altar, the priest began a service in prose. Beleth, one\r\nof the celebrated doctors of the university of Paris, who flourished\r\nin 1182, speaks of the \"feast of fools\" as in existence in his time;\r\nand the acts of the council of Paris, held in 1212, forbid the\r\npresence of archbishops and bishops, and more especially of monks and\r\nnuns, at the feasts of fools, \"in which a staff was carried.\"[70] We\r\nknow the proceedings of this latter festival rather minutely from\r\nthe accounts given in the ecclesiastical censures. It was in the\r\ncathedral churches that they elected the archbishop or bishop of\r\nfools, whose election was confirmed, and he was consecrated, with a\r\nmultitude of buffooneries. He then entered upon his pontifical duties\r\nwearing the mitre and carrying the crosier before the people, on whom\r\nhe bestowed his solemn benediction. In the exempt churches, or those\r\nwhich depended immediately upon the Holy See, they elected a pope of\r\nfools (_unum papam fatuorum_), who wore similarly the ensigns of the\r\npapacy. These dignitaries were assisted by an equally burlesque and\r\nlicentious clergy, who uttered and performed a mixture of follies and\r\nimpieties during the church service of the day, which they attended in\r\ndisguises and masquerade dresses. Some wore masks, or had their faces\r\npainted, and others were dressed in women's clothing, or in ridiculous\r\ncostumes. On entering the choir, they danced and sang licentious songs.\r\nThe deacons and sub-deacons ate black puddings and sausages on the\r\naltar while the priest was celebrating; others played at cards or dice\r\nunder his eyes; and others threw bits of old leather into the censer\r\nin order to raise a disagreeable smell. After the mass was ended, the\r\npeople broke out into all sorts of riotous behaviour in the church,\r\nleaping, dancing, and exhibiting themselves in indecent postures, and\r\nsome went as far as to strip themselves naked, and in this condition\r\nthey were drawn through the streets with tubs full of ordure and filth,\r\nwhich they threw about at the mob. Every now and then they halted,\r\nwhen they exhibited immodest postures and actions, accompanied with\r\nsongs and speeches of the same character. Many of the laity took part\r\nin the procession, dressed as monks and nuns. These disorders seem to\r\nhave been carried to their greatest degree of extravagance during the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries.[71]\r\n\r\n [70] \"A festis follorum ubi baculus accipitur omnino abstineatur....\r\n      Idem fortius monachis et monialibus prohibemus.\"\r\n\r\n [71] On the subject of all these burlesques and popular feasts and\r\n      ceremonies, the reader may consult Flögel's \"Geschichte des\r\n      Grotesk-Komischen,\" of which a new and enlarged edition has\r\n      recently been given by Dr. Friedrich W. Ebeling, 8vo., Leipzig,\r\n      1862. Much interesting information on the subject was collected\r\n      by Du Tilliot, in his \"Memoires pour servir à l'Histoire de la\r\n      Fête des Fous,\" 8vo., Lausanne, 1751. See also Rigollot, in the\r\n      work quoted above, and a popular article on the same subject will\r\n      be found in my \"Archæological Album.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the fifteenth century, lay societies, having apparently\r\nno connection with the clergy or the church, but of just the same\r\nburlesque character, arose in France. One of the earliest of these was\r\nformed by the clerks of the Bazoche, or lawyers' clerks of the Palais\r\nde Justice in Paris, whose president was a sort of king of misrule. The\r\nother principal society of this kind in Paris took the rather mirthful\r\nname of _Enfans sans Souci_ (Careless Boys); it consisted of young men\r\nof education, who gave to their president or chieftain the title of\r\n_Prince des Sots_ (the Prince of Fools). Both these societies composed\r\nand performed farces, and other small dramatic pieces. These farces\r\nwere satires on contemporary society, and appear to have been often\r\nvery personal.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 129. Money of the Archbishop of the Innocents._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 130. Money of the Pope of Fools._]\r\n\r\nAlmost the only monuments of the older of these societies consist of\r\ncoins, or tokens, struck in lead, and sometimes commemorating the\r\nnames of their mock dignitaries. A considerable number of these have\r\nbeen found in France, and an account of them, with engravings, was\r\npublished by Dr. Rigollot some years ago.[72] Our cut No. 129 will\r\nserve as an example. It represents a leaden token of the Archbishop of\r\nthe Innocents of the parish of St. Firmin, at Amiens, and is curious\r\nas bearing a date. On one side the archbishop of the Innocents is\r\nrepresented in the act of giving his blessing to his flock, surrounded\r\nby the inscription, MONETA · ARCHIEPI · SCTI · FIRMINI. On the other\r\nside we have the name of the individual who that year held the office\r\nof archbishop, NICOLAVS · GAVDRAM · ARCHIEPVS · 1520, surrounding a\r\ngroup consisting of two men, one of whom is dressed as a fool, holding\r\nbetween them a bird, which has somewhat the appearance of a magpie.\r\nOur cut No. 130 is still more curious; it is a token of the _pope_ of\r\nfools. On one side appears the pope with his tiara and double cross,\r\nand a fool in full costume, who approaches his bauble to the pontifical\r\ncross. It is certainly a bitter caricature on the papacy, whether that\r\nwere the intention or not. Two persons behind, dressed apparently in\r\nscholastic costume, seem to be merely spectators. The inscription is,\r\nMONETA · NOVA · ADRIANI · STVLTORV [M]· PAPE (the last E being in the\r\nfield of the piece), \"new money of Adrian, the pope of fools.\" The\r\ninscription on the other side of the token is one frequently repeated\r\non these leaden medals, STVLTORV [M] · INFINITVS · EST · NVMERVS, \"the\r\nnumber of fools is infinite.\" In the field we see Mother Folly holding\r\nup her bauble, and before her a grotesque figure in a cardinal's hat,\r\napparently kneeling to her. It is rather surprising that we find so\r\nfew allusions to these burlesque societies in the various classes\r\nof pictorial records from which the subject of these chapters has\r\nbeen illustrated; but we have evidence that they were not altogether\r\noverlooked. Until the latter end of the last century, the misereres of\r\nthe church of St. Spire, at Corbeil, near Paris, were remarkable for\r\nthe singular carvings with which they were decorated, and which have\r\nsince been destroyed, but fortunately they were engraved by Millin.\r\nOne of them, copied in our cut No. 131, evidently represents the bishop\r\nof fools conferring his blessing; the fool's bauble occupies the place\r\nof the pastoral staff.\r\n\r\n [72] \"Monnaies inconnues des Evêques des Innocens, des Fous,\" &c.,\r\n      Paris, 1837.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 131. The Bishop of Fools._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  THE DANCE OF DEATH.--THE PAINTINGS IN THE CHURCH OF LA CHAISE\r\n     DIEU.--THE REIGN OF FOLLY.--SEBASTIAN BRANDT; THE \"SHIP\r\n     OF FOOLS.\"--DISTURBERS OF CHURCH SERVICE.--TROUBLESOME\r\n     BEGGARS.--GEILER'S SERMONS.--BADIUS, AND HIS SHIP OF FOOLISH\r\n     WOMEN.--THE PLEASURES OF SMELL.--ERASMUS; THE \"PRAISE OF FOLLY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still one cycle of satire which almost belongs to the middle\r\nages, though it only became developed at their close, and became most\r\npopular after they were past. There existed, at least as early as the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century, a legendary story of an interview\r\nbetween three living and three dead men, which is usually told in\r\nFrench verse, and appears under the title of \"Des trois vifs et des\r\ntrois morts.\" According to some versions of the legend, it was St.\r\nMacarius, the Egyptian recluse, who thus introduced the living to the\r\ndead. The verses are sometimes accompanied with figures, and these have\r\nbeen found both sculptured and painted on ecclesiastical buildings. At\r\na later period, apparently early in the fifteenth century, some one\r\nextended this idea to all ranks of society, and pictured a skeleton,\r\nthe emblem of death, or even more than one, in communication with an\r\nindividual of each class; and this extended scene, from the manner\r\nof the grouping--in which the dead appeared to be wildly dancing off\r\nwith the living--became known as the \"Dance of Death.\" As the earlier\r\nlegend of the three dead and the three living was, however, still\r\noften introduced at the beginning of it, the whole group was most\r\ngenerally known--especially during the fifteenth century--as the \"Danse\r\nMacabre,\" or Dance of Macabre, this name being considered as a mere\r\ncorruption of Macarius. The temper of the age--in which death in every\r\nform was constantly before the eyes of all, and in which people sought\r\nto regard life as a mere transitory moment of enjoyment--gave to this\r\ngrim idea of the fellowship of death and life great popularity, and it\r\nwas not only painted on the walls of churches, but it was suspended\r\nin tapestry around people's chambers. Sometimes they even attempted\r\nto represent it in masquerade, and we are told that in the month of\r\nOctober, 1424, the \"Danse Macabre\" was publicly danced by living\r\npeople in the cemetery of the Innocents, in Paris--a fit place for so\r\nlugubrious a performance--in the presence of the Duke of Bedford and\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, who came to Paris after the battle of Verneuil.\r\nDuring the rest of the century we find not unfrequently allusions\r\nto the \"Danse Macabre.\" The English poet Lydgate wrote a series of\r\nstanzas to accompany the figures, and it was the subject of some of\r\nthe earliest engravings on wood. In the posture and accompaniments\r\nof the figures representing the different classes of society, and in\r\nthe greater or less reluctance with which the living accept their not\r\nvery attractive partners, satire is usually implied, and it is in\r\nsome cases accompanied with drollery. The figure representing death\r\nhas almost always a grimly mirthful countenance, and appears to be\r\ndancing with good will. The most remarkable early representation of\r\nthe \"Danse Macabre\" now preserved, is that painted on the wall of the\r\nchurch of La Chaise Dieu, in Auvergne, a beautiful fac-simile of which\r\nwas published a few years ago by the well-known antiquary M. Jubinal.\r\nThis remarkable picture begins with the figures of Adam and Eve, who\r\nare introducing death into the world in the form of a serpent with a\r\ndeath's head. The dance is opened by an ecclesiastic preaching from\r\na pulpit, towards whom death is leading first in the dance the pope,\r\nfor each individual takes his precedence strictly according to his\r\nclass--alternately an ecclesiastic and a layman. Thus next after the\r\npope comes the emperor, and the cardinal is followed by the king. The\r\nbaron is followed by the bishop, and the grim partner of the latter\r\nappears to pay more intention to the layman than to his own priest, so\r\nthat two dead men appear to have the former in charge. The group thus\r\nrepresented by the nobleman and the two deaths, is copied in our cut\r\nNo. 132, and will serve as an example of the style and grouping of this\r\nremarkable painting. After a few other figures, perhaps less striking,\r\nwe come to the merchant, who receives the advances of his partner with\r\na thoughtful air; while immediately after him another death is trying\r\nto make himself more acceptable to the bashful nun by throwing a cloak\r\nover his nakedness. In another place two deaths armed with bows and\r\narrows are scattering their shafts rather dangerously. Soon follow\r\nsome of the more gay and youthful members of society. Our cut No. 133\r\nrepresents the musician, who appears also to attract the attentions\r\nof two of the persecutors. In his dismay he is treading under foot\r\nhis own viol. The dance closes with the lower orders of society, and\r\nis concluded by a group which is not so easily understood. Before the\r\nend of the fifteenth century, there had appeared in Paris several\r\neditions of a series of bold engravings on wood, in a small folio\r\nsize, representing the same dance, though somewhat differently treated.\r\nFrance, indeed, appears to have been the native country of the \"Danse\r\nMacabre.\" But in the century following the beautiful set of drawings by\r\nthe great artist Hans Holbein, first published at Lyons in 1538, gave\r\nto the Dance of Death a still greater and wider celebrity. From this\r\ntime the subjects of this dance were commonly introduced in initial\r\nletters, and in the engraved borders of pages, especially in books of a\r\nreligious character.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 132. The Knight in the Dance of Death._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 133. The Musician in Death's Hands._]\r\n\r\nDeath may truly be said to have shared with Folly that melancholy\r\nperiod--the fifteenth century. As society then presented itself to\r\nthe eye, people might easily suppose that the world was running mad,\r\nand folly, in one shape or other, seemed to be the principle which\r\nruled most men's actions. The jocular societies, described in my last\r\nchapter, which multiplied in France during the fifteenth century,\r\ninitiated a sort of mock worship of Folly. That sort of inauguration\r\nof death which was performed in the \"Danse Macabre,\" was of French\r\ngrowth, but the grand crusade against folly appears to have originated\r\nin Germany. Sebastian Brandt was a native of Strasburg, born in 1458.\r\nHe studied in that city and in Bâle, became a celebrated professor in\r\nboth those places, and died at the former in 1520. The \"Ship of Fools,\"\r\nwhich has immortalised the name of Sebastian Brandt, is believed to\r\nhave been first published in the year 1494. The original German text\r\nwent through numerous editions within a few years; a Latin translation\r\nwas equally popular, and it was afterwards edited and enlarged by\r\nJodocus Badius Ascensius. A French text was no less successful; an\r\nEnglish translation was printed by Richard Pynson in 1509; a Dutch\r\nversion appeared in 1519. During the sixteenth century, Brandt's \"Ship\r\nof Fools\" was the most popular of books. It consists of a series of\r\nbold woodcuts, which form its characteristic feature, and of metrical\r\nexplanations, written by Brandt, and annexed to each cut. Taking his\r\ntext from the words of the preacher, \"Stultorum numerus est infinitus,\"\r\nBrandt exposes to the eye, in all its shades and forms, the folly\r\nof his contemporaries, and bares to view its roots and causes. The\r\ncuts are especially interesting as striking pictures of contemporary\r\nmanners. The \"Ship of Fools\" is the great ship of the world, into which\r\nthe various descriptions of fatuity are pouring from all quarters\r\nin boat-loads. The first folly is that of men who collected great\r\nquantities of books, not for their utility, but for their rarity, or\r\nbeauty of execution, or rich bindings, so that we see that bibliomania\r\nhad already taken its place among human vanities. The second class\r\nof fools were interested and partial judges, who sold justice for\r\nmoney, and are represented under the emblem of two fools throwing a\r\nboar into a caldron, according to the old Latin proverb, _Agere aprum\r\nin lebetem_. Then come the various follies of misers, fops, dotards,\r\nmen who are foolishly indulgent to their children, mischief-makers,\r\nand despisers of good advice; of nobles and men in power; of the\r\nprofane and the improvident; of foolish lovers; of extravagant\r\neaters and drinkers, &c., &c. Foolish talking, hypocrisy, frivolous\r\npursuits, ecclesiastical corruptions, impudicity, and a great number\r\nof other vices as well as follies, are duly passed in review, and are\r\nrepresented in various forms of satirical caricature, and sometimes\r\nin simpler unadorned pictures. Thus the foolish valuers of things are\r\nrepresented by a fool holding a balance, one scale of which contains\r\nthe sun, moon, and stars, to represent heaven and heavenly things, and\r\nthe other a castle and fields, to represent earthly things, the latter\r\nscale overweighing the other; and the procrastinator is pictured by\r\nanother fool, with a parrot perched on his head, and a magpie on each\r\nhand, all repeating _cras, cras, cras_ (to-morrow). Our cut No. 134\r\nrepresents a group of disturbers of church service. It was a common\r\npractice in former days to take to church hawks (which were constantly\r\ncarried about as the outward ensign of the gentleman) and dogs. The\r\nfool has here thrown back his fool's-cap to exhibit more fully the\r\nfashionable \"gent\" of the day; he carries his hawk on his hand, and\r\nwears not only a fashionable pair of shoes, but very fashionable clogs\r\nalso. These gentlemen _à la mode, turgentes genere et natalibus altis_,\r\nwe are told, were the persons who disturbed the church service by\r\nthe creaking of their shoes and clogs, the noise made by their birds,\r\nthe barking and quarrelling of their dogs, by their own whisperings,\r\nand especially with immodest women, whom they met in church as in a\r\nconvenient place of assignation. All these forms of the offence are\r\nexpressed in the picture. Our second example cut No. 135, which forms\r\nthe fifty-ninth title or subject in the \"Ship of Fools,\" represents\r\na party of the beggars with which, either lay or ecclesiastical, the\r\ncountry was then overrun. In the explanation, these wicked beggars are\r\ndescribed as indulging in idleness, in eating, drinking, rioting, and\r\nsleep, while they levy contributions on the charitable feelings of the\r\nhonest and industrious, and, under cover of begging, commit robbery\r\nwherever they find the opportunity. The beggar, who appears to be only\r\na deceptive cripple, leads his donkey laden with children, whom he is\r\nbringing up in the same profession, while his wife lingers behind to\r\nindulge in her bibulous propensities. These cuts will give a tolerable\r\nnotion of the general character of the whole, which amount in number to\r\na hundred and twelve, and therefore present a great variety of subjects\r\nrelative to almost every class and profession of life.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 134. Disturbers of Church Service._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 135. Mendicants on their Travels._]\r\n\r\nWe may remark, however, that after Folly had thus run through all the\r\nstages of society, until it had reached the lowest of all, the ranks\r\nof mendicity, the gods themselves became alarmed, the more so as this\r\ngreat movement was directed especially against Minerva, the goddess\r\nof wisdom, and they held a conclave to provide against it. The result\r\nis not told, but the course of Folly goes on as vigorously as ever.\r\nIgnorant fools who set up for physicians, fools who cannot understand\r\njokes, unwise mathematicians, astrologers, of the latter of which the\r\nmoraliser says, in his Latin verse--\r\n\r\n          _Siqua voles sortis prænoscere damna futuræ,\r\n            Et vitare malum, sol tibi signa dabit.\r\n          Sed tibi, stulte, tui cur non dedit ille furoris\r\n            Signa? aut, si dederit, cur tanta mala subis?\r\n          Nondum grammaticæ callis primordia, et audes\r\n            Vim cœli radio supposuisse tuo._\r\n\r\nThe next cut is a very curious one, and appears to represent a\r\ndissecting-house of this early period. Among other chapters which\r\nafford interesting pictures of that time, and indeed of all times, we\r\nmay instance those of litigious fools, who are always going to law,\r\nand who confound blind justice, or rather try to unbind her eyes;\r\nof filthy-tongued fools, who glorify the race of swine; of ignorant\r\nscholars; of gamblers; of bad and thievish cooks; of low men who seek\r\nto be high, and of high who are despisers of poverty; of men who\r\nforget that they will die; of irreligious men and blasphemers; of\r\nthe ridiculous indulgence of parents to children, and the ungrateful\r\nreturn which was made to them for it; and of women's pride. Another\r\ntitle describes the ruin of Christianity: the pope, emperor, king,\r\ncardinals, &c., are receiving willingly from a suppliant fool the cap\r\nof Folly, while two other fools are looking derisively upon them from\r\nan adjoining wall. It need hardly be said that this was published on\r\nthe eve of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the popularity which greeted the appearance of the\r\nwork of Sebastian Brandt, it attracted the special attention of a\r\ncelebrated preacher of the time named Johann Geiler. Geiler was born\r\nat Schaffhausen, in Switzerland, in 1445, but having lost his father\r\nwhen only three years of age, he was educated by his grandfather, who\r\nlived at Keysersberg, in Alsace, and hence he was commonly called\r\nGeiler of Keysersberg. He studied in Freiburg and Bâle, obtained a\r\ngreat reputation for learning, was esteemed a profound theologian, and\r\nwas finally settled in Strasburg, where he continued to shine as a\r\npreacher until his death in 1510. He was a bold man, too, in the cause\r\nof truth, and declaimed with earnest zeal against the corruptions of\r\nthe church, and especially against the monkish orders, for he compared\r\nthe black monks to the devil, the white monks to his dam, and the\r\nothers he said were their chickens. On another occasion he said that\r\nthe qualities of a good monk were an almighty belly, an ass's back,\r\nand a raven's mouth. He told his congregation from the pulpit that a\r\ngreat reformation was at hand, that he did not expect to live to see\r\nit himself, but that many of those who heard him would live to see\r\nit. As may be supposed, the monks hated him, and spoke of him with\r\ncontempt. They said, that in his sermons he took his texts, not from\r\nthe Scriptures, but from the \"Ship of Fools\" of Sebastian Brandt; and,\r\nin fact, during the year 1498, Geiler preached at Strasburg a series of\r\nsermons on the follies of his time, which were evidently founded upon\r\nBrandt's book, for the various follies were taken in the same order.\r\nThey were originally compiled in German, but one of Geiler's scholars,\r\nJacob Other, translated them into Latin, and published them, in 1501,\r\nunder the title of \"Navicula sive Speculum Fatuorum præstantissimi\r\nsacrarum literarum doctoris Johannis Geiler.\" Within a few years this\r\nwork went through several editions both in Latin and in German, some\r\nof them illustrated by woodcuts. The style of preaching is quaint and\r\ncurious, full of satirical wit, which is often coarse, according to the\r\nmanner of the time, sometimes very indelicate. Each sermon is headed\r\nby the motto, \"Stultorum infinitus est numerus.\" Geiler takes for his\r\ntheme in each sermon one of the titles of Brandt's \"Ship of Fools,\" and\r\nhe separates them into subdivisions, or branches, which he calls the\r\nbells (_nolas_) from the fool's-cap.\r\n\r\nThe other scholar who did most to spread the knowledge of Brandt's\r\nwork, was Jodocus Badius, who assumed the additional name of Ascensius\r\nbecause he was born at Assen, near Brussels, in 1462. He was a very\r\ndistinguished scholar, but is best known for having established a\r\ncelebrated printing establishment in Paris, where he died in 1535. I\r\nhave already stated that Badius edited the Latin translation of the\r\n\"Ship of Fools\" of Sebastian Brandt, with additional explanations of\r\nhis own, but he was one of the first of Brandt's imitators. He seems to\r\nhave thought that Brandt's book was not complete--that the weaker sex\r\nhad not received its fair share of importance; and apparently in 1498,\r\nwhile Geiler was turning the \"Stultifera Navis\" into sermons, Badius\r\ncompiled a sort of supplement to it (_additamentum_), to which he gave\r\nthe title of \"Stultiferæ naviculæ, seu Scaphæ, Fatuarum Mulierum,\" the\r\nBoats of Foolish Women. As far as can be traced, the first edition\r\nappears to have been printed in 1502. The first cut represents the\r\nship carrying Eve alone of the female race, whose folly involved the\r\nwhole world. The book is divided into five chapters, according to the\r\nnumber of the five senses, each sense represented by a boat carrying\r\nits particular class of foolish women to the great ship of foolish\r\nwomen, which lies off at anchor. The text consists of a dissertation\r\non the use and abuse of the particular sense which forms the substance\r\nof the chapter, and it ends with Latin verses, which are given as the\r\nboatman's _celeusma_, or boat song. The first of these boats is the\r\n_scapha stultæ visionis ad stultiferam navem perveniens_--the boat of\r\nfoolish seeing proceeding to the ship of fools. A party of gay ladies\r\nare taking possession of the boat, carrying with them their combs,\r\nlooking-glasses, and all other implements necessary for making them\r\nfair to be looked upon. The second boat is the _scapha auditionis\r\nfatuæ_, the boat of foolish hearing, in which the ladies are playing\r\nupon musical instruments. The third is the _scapha olfactionis stultæ_,\r\nthe boat of foolish smell, and the pictorial illustration to it is\r\npartly copied in our cut No. 136. In the original some of the ladies\r\nare gathering sweet-smelling flowers before they enter the boat, while\r\non board a pedlar is vending his perfume. One _folle femme_, with her\r\nfool's cap on her head, is buying a pomander, or, as we should perhaps\r\nnow say, a scent-ball, from the itinerant dealer. Figures of pomanders\r\nare extremely rare, and this is an interesting example; in fact, it\r\nis only recently that our Shakspearian critics really understood the\r\nmeaning of the word. A pomander was a small globular vessel, perforated\r\nwith holes, and filled with strong perfumes, as it is represented in\r\nour woodcut. The fourth of these boats is that of foolish tasting,\r\n_scapha gustationis fatuæ_, and the ladies have their well-furnished\r\ntable on board the boat, and are largely indulging in eating and\r\ndrinking. In the last of these boats, the _scapha contactionis fatuæ_,\r\nor boat of foolish feeling, the women have men on board, and are\r\nproceeding to great liberties with them; one of the gentle damsels,\r\ntoo, is picking the pocket of her male companion in a very unlady-like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 136. The Boat of Pleasant Odours._]\r\n\r\nTwo ideas combined in this peculiar field of satiric literature, that\r\nof the ship and that of the fools, now became popular, and gave rise\r\nto a host of imitators. There appeared ships of health, ships of\r\npenitence, ships of all sorts of things, on the one hand; and on the\r\nother, folly was a favourite theme of satire from many quarters. One of\r\nthe most remarkable of the personages involved in this latter warfare,\r\nwas the great scholar Desiderius Erasmus, of Rotterdam, who was born in\r\nthat city in 1467. Like most of these satirists, Erasmus was strongly\r\nimbued with the spirit of the Reformation, and he was the acquaintance\r\nand friend of those to whom the Reformation owed a great part of its\r\nsuccess. In 1497, when the \"Ship of Fools\" of Sebastian Brandt was in\r\nthe first full flush of its popularity, Erasmus came to England, and\r\nwas so well received, that from that time forward his literary life\r\nseemed more identified with our island than with any other country. His\r\nname is still a sort of household word in our universities, especially\r\nin that of Cambridge. He made here the friendly acquaintance of the\r\ngreat Sir Thomas More, himself a lover of mirth, and one of those whose\r\nnames are celebrated for having kept a court fool. In the earlier years\r\nof the sixteenth century, Erasmus visited Italy, and passed two or\r\nthree years there. He returned thence to England, as appears, early\r\nin the year 1508. It is not easy to decide whether his experience of\r\nsociety in Italy had convinced him more than ever that folly was the\r\npresiding genius of mankind, or what other feeling influenced him,\r\nbut one of the first results of his voyage was the Μωρίας Ἐγκώμιον\r\n(_Moriæ Encomium_), or \"Praise of Folly.\" Erasmus dedicated this\r\nlittle jocular treatise to Sir Thomas More as a sort of pun upon his\r\nname, although he protests that there was a great contrast between\r\nthe two characters. Erasmus takes much the same view of folly as\r\nBrandt, Geiler, Badius, and the others, and under this name he writes\r\na bold satire on the whole frame of contemporary society. The satire\r\nis placed in the mouth of Folly herself (the Mère Folie of the jocular\r\nclubs), who delivers from her pulpit a declamation in which she sets\r\nforth her qualities and praises. She boasts of the greatness of her\r\norigin, claims as her kindred the sophists, rhetoricians, and many of\r\nthe pretentious scholars and wise men, and describes her birth and\r\neducation. She claims divine affinity, and boasts of her influence over\r\nthe world, and of the beneficent manner in which it was exercised.\r\nAll the world, she pretends, was ruled under her auspices, and it was\r\nonly in her presence that mankind was really happy. Hence the happiest\r\nages of man are infancy, before wisdom has come to interfere, and old\r\nage, when it has passed away. Therefore, she says, if men would remain\r\nfaithful to her, and avoid wisdom altogether, they would pass a life\r\nof perpetual youth. In this long discourse of the influence of folly,\r\nwritten by a man of the known sentiments of Erasmus, it would be\r\nstrange if the Romish church, with its monks and ignorant priesthood,\r\nits saints, and relics, and miracles, did not find a place. Erasmus\r\nintimates that the superstitious follies had become permanent, because\r\nthey were profitable. There are some, he tells us, who cherished the\r\nfoolish yet pleasant persuasion, that if they fixed their eyes devoutly\r\non a figure of St. Christopher, carved in wood or painted on the wall,\r\nthey would be safe from death on that day; with many other examples\r\nof equal credulity. Then there are your pardons, your measures of\r\npurgatory, which may be bought off at so much the hour, or the day,\r\nor the month, and a multitude of other absurdities. Ecclesiastics,\r\nscholars, mathematicians, philosophers, all come in for their share of\r\nthe refined satire of this book, which, like the \"Ship of Fools,\" has\r\ngone through innumerable editions, and has been translated into many\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 137. Superstition._]\r\n\r\nIn an early French translation, the text of this work of Erasmus\r\nis embellished with some of the woodcuts belonging to Brandt's\r\n\"Ship of Fools,\" which, it need hardly be remarked, are altogether\r\ninappropriate, but the \"Praise of Folly\" was detained to receive\r\nillustrations from a more distinguished pencil. A copy of the book came\r\ninto the hands of Hans Holbein--it may possibly have been presented to\r\nhim by the author--and Holbein took so much interest in it, that he\r\namused himself with drawing illustrative sketches with a pen in the\r\nmargins. This book afterwards passed into the library of the University\r\nof Bâle, where it was found in the latter part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and these drawings have since been engraved and added to most\r\nof the subsequent editions. Many of these sketches are very slight, and\r\nsome have not a very close connection with the text of Erasmus, but\r\nthey are all characteristic, and show the spirit--the spirit of the\r\nage--in which Holbein read his author. I give two examples of them,\r\ntaken almost haphazard, for it would require a longer analysis of the\r\nbook than can be given here to make many of them understood. The first\r\nof these, our cut No. 137, represents the foolish warrior, who has a\r\nsword long enough to trust to it for defence, bowing with trembling\r\nsuperstition before a painting of St. Christopher crossing the water\r\nwith the infant Christ on his shoulder, as a more certain security for\r\nhis safety during that day. The other, our cut No. 138, represents\r\nthe preacher, Lady Folly, descending from her pulpit, after she has\r\nconcluded her sermon.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 138. Preacher Folly ending her Sermon._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  POPULAR LITERATURE AND ITS HEROES; BROTHER RUSH, TYLL EULENSPIEGEL,\r\n     THE WISE MEN OF GOTHAM.--STORIES AND JEST-BOOKS.--SKELTON, SCOGIN,\r\n     TARLTON, PEELE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people in the middle ages, as well as its superiors, had its\r\ncomic literature and legend. Legend was the literature especially of\r\nthe peasant, and in it the spirit of burlesque and satire manifested\r\nitself in many ways. Simplicity, combined with vulgar cunning, and the\r\ncircumstances arising out of the exercise of these qualities, presented\r\nthe greatest stimulants to popular mirth. They produced their popular\r\nheroes, who, at first, were much more than half legendary, such as\r\nthe familiar spirit, Robin Goodfellow, whose pranks were a source of\r\ncontinual amusement rather than of terror to the simple minds which\r\nlistened to those who told them. These stories excited with still\r\ngreater interest as their spiritual heroes became incarnate, and the\r\nauditors were persuaded that the perpetrators of so many artful acts of\r\ncunning and of so many mischievous practical jokes, were but ordinary\r\nmen like themselves. It was but a sign or symbol of the change from\r\nthe mythic age to that of practical life. One of the earliest of these\r\nstories of mythic comedy transformed into, or at least presented under\r\nthe guise of, humanity, is that of Brother Ruth. Although the earliest\r\nversion of this story with which we are acquainted dates only from the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century,[73] there is no reason for doubt\r\nthat the story itself was in existence at a much more remote period.\r\n\r\n [73] This earliest known version is in German verse, and was printed\r\n      in 1515. An English version, in prose, was printed in 1620, and\r\n      is reprinted in Thoms's \"Collection of Early Prose Romances.\"\r\n\r\nRush was, in truth, a spirit of darkness, whose mission it was\r\nto wander on the earth tempting and impelling people to do evil.\r\nPerceiving that the internal condition of a certain abbey was well\r\nsuited to his purpose, he presented himself at its gates in the\r\ndisguise of a youth who wanted employment, and was received as an\r\nassistant in the kitchen, but he pleased the monks best by the skill\r\nwith which he furnished them all with fair companions. At length he\r\nquarrelled with the cook, and threw him into the boiling caldron, and\r\nthe monks, assuming that his death was accidental, appointed Rush to be\r\ncook in his place. After a service of seven years in the kitchen--which\r\nappears to have been considered a fair apprenticeship for the new\r\nhonour which was to be conferred upon him--the abbot and convent\r\nrewarded him by making him a monk. He now followed still more earnestly\r\nhis design for the ruin of his brethren, both soul and body, and began\r\nby raising a quarrel about a woman, which led, through his contrivance,\r\nto a fight, in which the monks all suffered grievous bodily injuries,\r\nand in which Brother Rush was especially active. He went on in this\r\nway until at last his true character was accidentally discovered. A\r\nneighbouring farmer, overtaken by night, took shelter in a hollow tree.\r\nIt happened to be the night appointed by Lucifer to meet his agents\r\non earth, and hear from them the report of their several proceedings,\r\nand he had selected this very oak as the place of rendezvous. There\r\nBrother Rush appeared, and the farmer, in his hiding-place, heard his\r\nconfession from his own lips, and told it to the abbot, who, being as\r\nit would appear a magician, conjured him into the form of a horse, and\r\nbanished him. Rush hurried away to England, where he laid aside his\r\nequine form, and entered the body of the king's daughter, who suffered\r\ngreat torments from his possession. At length some of the great doctors\r\nfrom Paris came and obliged the spirit to confess that nobody but the\r\nabbot of the distant monastery had any power over him. The abbot came,\r\ncalled him out of the maiden, and conjured him more forcibly than ever\r\ninto the form of a horse.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in mere outline, the story of Brother Rush, which was\r\ngradually enlarged by the addition of new incidents. But the people\r\nwanted a hero who presented more of the character of reality, who,\r\nin fact, might be recognised as one of themselves; and such heroes\r\nappear to have existed at all times. They usually represented a\r\nclass in society, and especially that class which consisted of idle\r\nsharpers, who lived by their wits, and which was more numerous and more\r\nfamiliarly known in the middle ages than at the present day. Folly\r\nand cunning combined presented a never-failing subject of mirth. This\r\nclass of adventurers first came into print in Germany, and it is there\r\nthat we find its first popular hero, to whom they gave the name of\r\nEulenspiegel, which means literally \"the owl's mirror,\" and has been\r\nsince used in German in the sense of a merry fool. Tyll Eulenspiegel,\r\nand his story, are supposed to have belonged to the fourteenth century,\r\nthough we first know them in the printed book of the commencement of\r\nthe sixteenth, which is believed to have come from the pen of the\r\nwell-known popular writer, Thomas Murner, of whom I shall have to speak\r\nmore at length in another chapter. The popularity of this work was very\r\ngreat, and it was quickly translated into French, English, Latin, and\r\nalmost every other language of Western Europe. In the English version\r\nthe name also was translated, and appears under the form of Owleglass,\r\nor, as it often occurs with the superfluous aspirate, Howleglass.[74]\r\nAccording to the story, Tyll Eulenspiegel was the son of a peasant, and\r\nwas born at a village called Kneitlingen, in the land of Brunswick.\r\nThe story of his birth may be given in the words of the early English\r\nversion, as a specimen of its quaint and antiquated language:--\r\n\r\n     \"Yn the lande of Sassen, in the vyllage of Ruelnige, there\r\n     dwelleth a man that was named Nicholas Howleglas, that had a wife\r\n     named Wypeke, that lay a childbed in the same wyllage, and that\r\n     chylde was borne to christening; and named Tyell Howleglass. And\r\n     than the chyld was brought into a taverne, where the father was\r\n     wyth his gosseppes and made good chere. Whan the mydwife had wel\r\n     dronke, she toke the childe to bere it home, and in the wai was a\r\n     litle bridg over a muddy water. And as the mydwife would have gone\r\n     over the lytle brydge, she fel into the mudde with the chylde,\r\n     for she had a lytel dronk to much wyne, for had not helpe come\r\n     quickly, the had both be drowned in the mudde. And whan she came\r\n     home with the childe, the made a kettle of warm water to be made\r\n     redi, and therin they washed the child clen of the mudde. And\r\n     thus was Howleglas thre tymes in one dai cristened, once at the\r\n     churche, once in the mudde, and once in the warm water.\"\r\n\r\n [74] The title of this English translation is, \"Here beginneht a merye\r\n      Jest of a man that was called Howleglas, and of many marveylous\r\n      thinges and jestes that he dyd in his lyfe, in Eastlande, and in\r\n      many other places.\" It was printed by Coplande, supposed about\r\n      1520. An edition of Eulenspiegel in English, by Mr. Kenneth\r\n      Mackenzie, has recently been published by Messrs. Trübner & Co.,\r\n      of Paternoster Row.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the English translator was not very correct in his\r\ngeography or in his names. The child, having thus escaped destruction,\r\ngrew rapidly, and displayed an extraordinary love of mischief, with\r\nvarious other evil propensities, as well as a cunning beyond his age,\r\nin escaping the risks to which these exposed him. At a very early age,\r\nhe displayed a remarkable talent for setting the other children by the\r\nears, and this was his favourite amusement during life. His mother,\r\nwho was now a widow, contemplating the extraordinary cunning of her\r\nchild, which, as she thought, must necessarily ensure his advancement\r\nin the world, resolved that he should no longer remain idle, and put\r\nhim apprentice to a baker; but his wicked and restless disposition\r\ndefeated all the good intentions of his parent, and Eulenspiegel was\r\nobliged to leave his master in consequence of his mal-practices. One\r\nday his mother took him to a church-dedication, and the child drank\r\nso much at the feast on that occasion, that he crept into an empty\r\nbeehive and fell asleep, while his mother, thinking he had gone home,\r\nreturned without him. In the night-time two thieves came into the\r\ngarden to steal the bees, and they agreed to take first the hive which\r\nwas heaviest. This, as may be supposed, proved to be the hive in\r\nwhich Eulenspiegel was hidden, and they fixed it on a pole which they\r\ncarried on their shoulders, one before and one behind, the hive hanging\r\nbetween them. Eulenspiegel, awakened by the movement, soon discovered\r\nthe position in which he was placed, and hit upon a plan for escaping.\r\nGently lifting the lid of the hive, he put out his arm and plucked the\r\nhair of the man before, who turned about and accused his companion of\r\ninsulting him. The other asserted that he had not touched him, and the\r\nfirst, only half satisfied, continued to bear his share of the burthen,\r\nbut he had not advanced many steps when a still sharper pull at his\r\nhair excited his great anger, and from wrathful words the two thieves\r\nproceeded to blows. While they were fighting, Eulenspiegel crept out of\r\nthe hive and ran away.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the baker, Eulenspiegel became a wanderer in the world,\r\ngaining his living by his trickery and deception, and engaging himself\r\nin all sorts of strange and ludicrous adventures. He ended everywhere\r\nby creating discord and strife. He became at different times a\r\nblacksmith, a shoemaker, a tailor, a cook, a drawer of teeth, and\r\nassumed a variety of other characters, but remained in each situation\r\nonly long enough to make it too hot for him, and to be obliged to\r\nsecure his retreat. He intruded himself into all classes of society,\r\nand invariably came to similar results. Many of his adventures, indeed,\r\nare so droll that we can easily understand the great popularity\r\nthey once enjoyed. But they are not merely amusing--they present a\r\ncontinuous satire upon contemporary society, upon a social condition in\r\nwhich every pretender, every reckless impostor, every private plunderer\r\nor public depredator, saw the world exposed to him in its folly and\r\ncredulity as an easy prey.\r\n\r\nThe middle ages possessed another class of these popular satirical\r\nhistories, which were attached to places rather than to persons. There\r\nwere few countries which did not possess a town or a district, the\r\ninhabitants of which were celebrated for stupidity, or for roguery,\r\nor for some other ridiculous or contemptible quality. We have seen,\r\nin a former chapter, the people of Norfolk enjoying this peculiarity,\r\nand, at a later period, the inhabitants of Pevensey in Sussex, and\r\nmore especially those of Gotham in Nottinghamshire, were similarly\r\ndistinguished. The inhabitants of many places in Germany bore this\r\ncharacter, but their grand representatives among the Germans were the\r\nSchildburgers, a name which appears to belong entirely to the domain\r\nof fable. Schildburg, we are told, was a town \"in Misnopotamia, beyond\r\nUtopia, in the kingdom of Calecut.\" The Schildburgers were originally\r\nso renowned for their wisdom, that they were continually invited into\r\nforeign countries to give their advice, until at length not a man was\r\nleft at home, and their wives were obliged to assume the charge of the\r\nduties of their husbands. This became at length so onerous, that the\r\nwives held a council, and resolved on despatching a solemn message\r\nin writing to call the men home. This had the desired effect; all the\r\nSchildburgers returned to their own town, and were so joyfully received\r\nby their wives that they resolved upon leaving it no more. They\r\naccordingly held a council, and it was decided that, having experienced\r\nthe great inconvenience of a reputation of wisdom, they would avoid\r\nit in future by assuming the character of fools. One of the first\r\nevil results of their long neglect of home affairs was the want of a\r\ncouncil-hall, and this want they now resolved to supply without delay.\r\nThey accordingly went to the hills and woods, cut down the timber,\r\ndragged it with great labour to the town, and in due time completed\r\nthe erection of a handsome and substantial building. But, when they\r\nentered their new council-hall, what was their consternation to find\r\nthemselves in perfect darkness! In fact, they had forgotten to make\r\nany windows. Another council was held, and one who had been among the\r\nwisest in the days of their wisdom, gave his opinion very oracularly;\r\nthe result of which was that they should experiment on every possible\r\nexpedient for introducing light into the hall, and that they should\r\nfirst try that which seemed most likely to succeed. They had observed\r\nthat the light of day was caused by sunshine, and the plan proposed was\r\nto meet at mid-day when the sun was brightest, and fill sacks, hampers,\r\njugs, and vessels of all kinds, with sunshine and daylight, which they\r\nproposed afterwards to empty into the unfortunate council-hall. Next\r\nday, as the clock struck one, you might see a crowd of Schildburgers\r\nbefore the council-house door, busily employed, some holding the sacks\r\nopen, and others throwing the light into them with shovels and any\r\nother appropriate implements which came to hand. While they were thus\r\nlabouring, a stranger came into the town of Schildburg, and, hearing\r\nwhat they were about, told them they were labouring to no purpose,\r\nand offered to show them how to get the daylight into the hall. It is\r\nunnecessary to say more than that this new plan was to make an opening\r\nin the roof, and that the Schildburgers witnessed the effect with\r\nastonishment, and were loud in their gratitude to their new comer.\r\n\r\nThe Schildburgers met with further difficulties before they completed\r\ntheir council-hall. They sowed a field with salt, and when the\r\nsalt-plant grew up next year, after a meeting of the council, at\r\nwhich it was stiffly disputed whether it ought to be reaped, or mowed,\r\nor gathered in in some other manner, it was finally discovered that\r\nthe crop consisted of nothing but nettles. After many accidents of\r\nthis kind, the Schildburgers are noticed by the emperor, and obtain a\r\ncharter of incorporation and freedom, but they profit little by it. In\r\ntrying some experiments to catch mice, they set fire to their houses,\r\nand the whole town is burnt to the ground, upon which, in their sorrow,\r\nthey abandon it altogether, and become, like the Jews of old, scattered\r\nover the world, carrying their own folly into every country they visit.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known edition of the history of the Schildburgers was\r\nprinted in 1597,[75] but the story itself is no doubt older. It will\r\nbe seen at once that it involves a satire upon the municipal towns of\r\nthe middle ages. A similar series of adventures, only a little more\r\nclerical, bore the title of \"Der Pfarrherrn vom Kalenberg,\" or the\r\nParson of Kalenberg, and was first, as far as we know, published in the\r\nlatter half of the sixteenth century. The first known edition, printed\r\nin 1582, is in prose. Von der Hagen, who reprinted a subsequent edition\r\nin verse, in a volume already quoted, seems to think that in its first\r\nform the story belongs to the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n [75] It was reprinted by Von der Hagen, in a little volume entitled\r\n      \"Narrenbuch; herausgegeben durch Friedrich Heinrich von der\r\n      Hagen.\" 12mo., Halle, 1811.\r\n\r\nThe Schildburgers of Germany were represented in England by the wise\r\nmen of Gotham. Gotham is a village and parish about seven miles to\r\nthe south-west of Nottingham, and, curiously enough, a story is told\r\naccording to which the folly of the men of Gotham, like that of the\r\nSchildburgers, was at first assumed. It is pretended that one day\r\nking John, on his way to Nottingham, intended to pass through the\r\nvillage of Gotham, and that the Gothamites, under the influence of\r\nsome vague notion that his presence would be injurious to them, raised\r\ndifficulties in his way which prevented his visit. The men of Gotham\r\nwere now apprehensive of the king's vengeance, and they resolved\r\nto try and evade it by assuming the character of simpletons. When\r\nthe king's officers came to Gotham to inquire into the conduct of\r\nthe inhabitants, they found them engaged in the most extraordinary\r\npursuits, some of them seeking to drown an eel in a pond of water,\r\nothers making a hedge round a tree to confine a cuckoo which had\r\nsettled in it, and others employing themselves in similar futile\r\npursuits. The commissioners reported the people of Gotham to be no\r\nbetter than fools, and by this stratagem they escaped any further\r\npersecution, but the character they assumed remained attached to them.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is, of course, very late and very apocryphal; but\r\nthere can be little doubt that the character of the wise men of Gotham\r\nis one of considerable antiquity. The story is believed to have been\r\ndrawn up in its present form by Andrew Borde, an English writer of the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. It was reprinted a great number of times under\r\nthe form of those popular books called chap-books, because they were\r\nhawked about the country by itinerant booksellers or chap-men. The\r\nacts of the Gothamites displayed a greater degree of simplicity even\r\nthan those of the Schildburgers, but they are less connected. Here\r\nis one anecdote told in the unadorned language of the chap-books, in\r\nexplanation of which it is only necessary to state that the men of\r\nGotham admired greatly the note of the cuckoo. \"On a time the men of\r\nGotham fain would have pinn'd in the cuckow, that she might sing all\r\nthe year; and, in the midst of the town, they had a hedge made round in\r\ncompass, and got a cuckow and put her into it, and said, 'Sing here,\r\nand you shall lack neither meat nor drink all the year.' The cuckow,\r\nwhen she perceived herself encompassed with the hedge, flew away. 'A\r\nvengeance on her,' said these wise men, 'we did not make our hedge high\r\nenough.'\" On another occasion, having caught a large eel which offended\r\nthem by its voracity, they assembled in council to deliberate on an\r\nappropriate punishment, which ended in a resolution that it should be\r\ndrowned, and the criminal was ceremoniously thrown into a great pond.\r\nOne day twelve men of Gotham went a-fishing, and on their way home they\r\nsuddenly discovered that they had lost one of their number, and each\r\ncounted in his turn, and could find only eleven. In fact, each forgot\r\nto count himself. In the midst of their distress--for they believed\r\ntheir companion to be drowned--a stranger approached, and learnt the\r\ncause of their sorrow. Finding they were not to be convinced of their\r\nmistake by mere argument, he offered, on certain conditions, to find\r\nthe lost Gothamite, and he proceeded as follows. He took one by one\r\neach of the twelve Gothamites, struck him a hard blow on the shoulder,\r\nwhich made him scream, and at each cry counted one, two, three, &c.\r\nWhen it came to twelve, they were all satisfied that the lost Gothamite\r\nhad returned, and paid the man for the service he had rendered them.\r\n\r\nAs a chap-book, this history of the men of Gotham became so popular,\r\nthat it gave rise to a host of other books of similar character, which\r\nwere compiled at a later period under such titles--formerly well\r\nknown to children--as, \"The Merry Frolicks, or the Comical Cheats of\r\nSwalpo;\" \"The Witty and Entertaining Exploits of George Buchanan,\r\ncommonly called the King's Fool;\" \"Simple Simon's Misfortunes;\" and the\r\nlike. Nor must it be forgotten that the history of Eulenspiegel was\r\nthe prototype of a class of popular histories of larger dimensions,\r\nrepresented in our own literature by \"The English Rogue,\" the work of\r\nRichard Head and Francis Kirkman, in the reign of Charles II., and\r\nvarious other \"rogues\" belonging to different countries, which appeared\r\nabout that time, or not long afterwards. The earliest of these books\r\nwas \"The Spanish Rogue, or Life of Guzman de Alfarache,\" written in\r\nSpanish by Mateo Aleman in the latter part of the sixteenth century.\r\nCuriously enough, some Englishman, not knowing apparently that the\r\nhistory of Eulenspiegel had appeared in English under the name of\r\nOwlglass, took it into his head to introduce him among the family of\r\nrogues which had thus come into fashion, and, in 1720, published as\r\n\"Made English from the High Dutch,\" what he called \"The German Rogue,\r\nor the Life and Merry Adventures, Cheats, Stratagems, and Contrivances\r\nof Tiel Eulespiegle.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century was the period during which mediæval forms\r\ngenerally were changing into forms adapted to another state of society,\r\nand in which much of the popular literature which has been in vogue\r\nduring modern times took its rise. In the fourteenth century, the\r\nfabliaux of the jougleurs were already taking what we may perhaps term\r\na more literary form, and were reduced into prose narratives. This\r\ntook place especially in Italy, where these prose tales were called\r\n_novelle_, implying some novelty in their character, a word which was\r\ntransferred into the French language under the form of _nouvelles_,\r\nand was the origin of our modern English _novel_, applied to a work of\r\nfiction. The Italian novelists adopted the Eastern plan of stringing\r\nthese stories together on the slight framework of one general plot,\r\nin which are introduced causes for telling them and persons who tell\r\nthem. Thus the Decameron of Boccaccio holds towards the fabliaux\r\nexactly the same position as that of the \"Arabian Nights\" to the older\r\nArabian tales. The Italian novelists became numerous and celebrated\r\nthroughout Europe, from the time of Boccaccio to that of Straparola,\r\nat the commencement of the sixteenth century, and later. The taste for\r\nthis class of literature appears to have been introduced into France at\r\nthe court of Burgundy, where, under duke Philippe le Bon, a well-known\r\ncourtier and man of letters named Antoine de La Sale, who had, during\r\na sojourn in Italy, become acquainted with one of the most celebrated\r\nof the earlier Italian collections, the \"Cento Novello,\" or the Hundred\r\nNovels, compiled a collection in French in imitation of them, under the\r\ntitle of \"Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles,\" or the Hundred new Novels,\r\none of the purest examples of the French language in the fifteenth\r\ncentury.[76] The later French story-books, such as the Heptameron of\r\nthe queen of Navarre, and others, belong chiefly to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. These collections of stories can hardly be said to have ever\r\ntaken root in this island as a part of English literature.\r\n\r\n [76] I am obliged to pass over this part of the subject very rapidly.\r\n      For the history of that remarkable book, the \"Cent Nouvelles\r\n      Nouvelles,\" I would refer the reader to the preface to my own\r\n      edition, \"Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, publiées d'après le\r\n      seul manuscrit connu, avec Introduction et Notes, par M. Thomas\r\n      Wright.\" 2 vols, 12mo., Paris, 1858.\r\n\r\nBut there arose partly out of these stories a class of books which\r\nbecame greatly multiplied, and were, during a long period, extremely\r\npopular. With the household fool, or jester, instead of the old\r\njougleur, the stories had been shorn of their detail, and sank into\r\nthe shape of mere witty anecdotes, and at the same time a taste arose\r\nfor what we now class under the general term of jests, clever sayings,\r\nwhat the French call _bons mots_, and what the English of the sixteenth\r\ncentury termed \"quick answers.\" The word _jest_ itself arose from the\r\ncircumstance that the things designated by it arose out of the older\r\nstories, for it is a mere corruption of gestes, the Latin _gesta_, in\r\nthe sense of narratives of acts or deeds, or tales. The Latin writers,\r\nwho first began to collect them into books, included them under the\r\ngeneral name of _facetiæ_. The earlier of these collections of facetiæ\r\nwere written in Latin, and of the origin of the first with which we\r\nare acquainted, that by the celebrated scholar Poggio of Florence,\r\na curious anecdote is told. Some wits of the court of pope Martin\r\nV., elected to the papacy in 1417, among whom were the pope's two\r\nsecretaries, Poggio and Antonio Lusco, Cincio of Rome, and Ruzello of\r\nBologna, appropriated to themselves a private corner in the Vatican,\r\nwhere they assembled to chat freely among themselves. They called\r\nit their _buggiale_, a word which signifies in Italian, a place of\r\nrecreation, where they tell stories, make jests, and amuse themselves\r\nwith discussing satirically the doings and characters of everybody.\r\nThis was the way in which Poggio and his friends entertained themselves\r\nin their buggiale, and we are assured that in their talk they neither\r\nspared the church nor the pope himself or his government. The facetiæ\r\nof Poggio, in fact, which are said to be a selection of the good things\r\nsaid in these meetings, show neither reverence for the church of Rome\r\nnor respect for decency, but they are mostly stories which had been\r\ntold over and over again, long before Poggio came into the world. It\r\nwas perhaps this satire upon the church and upon the ecclesiastics\r\nwhich gave much of their popularity to these facetiæ at a time when\r\na universal agitation of men's minds on religious affairs prevailed,\r\nwhich was the great harbinger of the Reformation; and the next Latin\r\nbooks of facetiæ came from men such as Henry Bebelius, who were zealous\r\nreformers themselves.\r\n\r\nMany of the jests in these Latin collections are put into the mouths of\r\njesters, or domestic fools, _fatui_, or _moriones_, as they are called\r\nin the Latin; and in England, where these jest-books in the vernacular\r\ntongue became more popular perhaps than in any other country, many\r\nof them were published under the names of celebrated jesters, as the\r\n\"Merie Tales of Skelton,\" \"The Jests of Scogin,\" \"Tarlton's Jests,\" and\r\n\"The Jests of George Peele.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Skelton, poet-laureat of his time, appears to have been known in\r\nthe courts of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. quite as much in the character\r\nof a jester as in that of a poet. Poet-laureat was then a title or\r\ndegree given in the university of Oxford. His \"Merye Tales\" are all\r\npersonal of himself, and we should be inclined to say that his jests\r\nand his poetry are equally bad. The former picture him as holding a\r\nplace somewhere between Eulenspiegel and the ordinary court-fool. We\r\nmay give as a sample of the best of them the tale No. 1.--\r\n\r\n     \"_How Skelton came home late to Oxford from Abington._\r\n\r\n     \"Skelton was an Englysheman borne as Skogyn was, and hee was\r\n     educated and broughte up in Oxfoorde, and there was he made a\r\n     poete lauriat. And on a tyme he had ben at Abbington to make mery,\r\n     wher that he had eate salte meates, and hee did com late home to\r\n     Oxforde, and he did lye in an ine named the Tabere, whyche is now\r\n     the Angell, and hee dyd drynke, and went to bed. About midnight\r\n     he was so thyrstie or drye that he was constrained to call to\r\n     the tapster for drynke, and the tapster harde him not. Then hee\r\n     cryed to hys oste and hys ostes, and to the ostler, for drinke,\r\n     and no man would here hym. Alacke, sayd Skelton, I shall peryshe\r\n     for lacke of drynke! What reamedye? At the last he dyd crie out\r\n     and sayd, Fyer, fyer, fyer! When Skelton hard every man bustle\r\n     hymselfe upward, and some of them were naked, and some were halfe\r\n     asleepe and amased, and Skelton dyd crye, Fier, fier! styll, that\r\n     everye man knewe not whether to resorte. Skelton did go to bed,\r\n     and the oste and ostis, and the tapster, with the ostler, dyd\r\n     runne to Skeltons chamber with candles lyghted in theyr handes,\r\n     saying, Where, where, where is the fyer? Here, here, here, said\r\n     Skelton, and poynted hys fynger to hys mouth, saying, Fetch me\r\n     some drynke to quenche the fyer and the heate and the drinesse in\r\n     my mouthe. And so they dyd.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of these \"Merye Tales\" of Skelton contains a satire upon\r\nthe practice which prevailed in the sixteenth and early part of the\r\nseventeenth centuries of obtaining letters-patent of monopoly from the\r\ncrown, and also on the bibulous propensities of Welshmen--\r\n\r\n     \"_How the Welshman dyd desyre Skelton to ayde hym in hys sute to\r\n     the kynge for a patent to sell drynke._\r\n\r\n     \"Skelton, when he was in London, went to the kynges courte,\r\n     where there did come to hym a Welshman, saying, Syr, it is so,\r\n     that manye dooth come upp of my country to the kynges court, and\r\n     some doth get of the kyng by patent a castell, and some a parke,\r\n     and some a forest, and some one fee and some another, and they\r\n     dooe lyve lyke honest men; and I shoulde lyve as honestly as\r\n     the best, if I myght have a patyne for good dryncke, wherefore\r\n     I dooe praye yow to write a fewe woords for mee in a lytle byll\r\n     to geve the same to the kynges handes, and I wil geve you well\r\n     for your laboure. I am contented, sayde Skelton. Syt downe then,\r\n     sayde the Welshman, and write. What shall I wryte? sayde Skelton.\r\n     The Welshman sayde wryte _dryncke_. Nowe, sayde the Welshman,\r\n     write _more dryncke_. What now? sayde Skelton. Wryte nowe, _a\r\n     great deale of dryncke_. Nowe, sayd the Welshman, putte to all\r\n     thys dryncke _a littell crome of breade_, and _a great deale of\r\n     drynke_ to it, and reade once agayne. Skelton dyd reade, _Dryncke,\r\n     more dryncke, and a great deale of dryncke, and a lytle crome of\r\n     breade, and a great deale of dryncke to it_. Than the Welshman\r\n     sayde, Put oute _the litle crome of breade_, and sette in, _all\r\n     dryncke and no breade_. And if I myght have thys sygned of the\r\n     kynge, sayde the Welshman, I care for no more, as longe as I dooe\r\n     lyve. Well then, sayde Skelton, when you have thys signed of the\r\n     kyng, then wyll I labour for a patent to have bread, that you wyth\r\n     your drynke and I with the bread may fare well, and seeke our\r\n     livinge with bagge and staffe.\"\r\n\r\nThese two tales are rather favourable specimens of the collection\r\npublished under the name of Skelton, which, as far as we know, was\r\nfirst printed about the middle of the sixteenth century. The collection\r\nof the jests of Scogan, or, as he was popularly called, Scogin, which\r\nis said to have been compiled by Andrew Borde, was probably given to\r\nthe world a few years before, but no copies of the earlier editions are\r\nnow known to exist. Scogan, the hero of these jests, is described as\r\noccupying at the court of Henry VII. a position not much different from\r\nthat of an ordinary court-fool. Good old Holinshed the chronicler says\r\nof him, perhaps a little too gently, that he was \"a learned gentleman\r\nand student for a time in Oxford, of a pleasant wit, and bent to merrie\r\ndevices, in respect whereof he was called into the court, where, giving\r\nhimselfe to his naturall inclination of mirth and pleasant pastime,\r\nhe plaied manie sporting parts, although not in such uncivil manner\r\nas hath beene of him reported.\" This allusion refers most probably to\r\nthe jests, which represent him as leading a life of low and coarse\r\nbuffoonery, in the course of which he displayed a considerable\r\nshare of the dishonest and mischievous qualities of the less real\r\nEulenspiegel. He is even represented as personally insulting the king\r\nand queen, and as being consequently banished over the Channel, to\r\nshow no more respect to the majesty of the king of France. Scogin's\r\njests, like Skelton's, consist in a great measure of those practical\r\njokes which appear in all former ages to have been the delight of the\r\nTeutonic race. Many of them are directed against the ignorance and\r\nworldliness of the clergy. Scogin is described as being at one time\r\nhimself a teacher in the university, and on one occasion, we are told,\r\na husbandman sent his son to school to him that he might be made a\r\npriest. The whole story, which runs through several chapters, is an\r\nexcellent caricature on the way in which men vulgarly ignorant were\r\nintruded into the priesthood before the Reformation. At length, after\r\nmuch blundering, the scholar came to be ordained, and his examination\r\nis reported as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"_How the scholler said Tom Miller of Oseney was Jacob's father._\r\n\r\n     \"After this, the said scholler did come to the next orders, and\r\n     brought a present to the ordinary from Scogin, but the scholler's\r\n     father paid for all. Then said the ordinary to the scholler, I\r\n     must needes oppose you, and for master Scogin's sake, I will\r\n     oppose you in a light matter. Isaac had two sons, Esau and Jacob.\r\n     Who was Jacob's father? The scholler stood still, and could not\r\n     tell. Well, said the ordinary, I cannot admit you to be priest\r\n     untill the next orders, and then bring me an answer. The scholler\r\n     went home with a heavy heart, bearing a letter to master Scogin,\r\n     how his scholler could not answer to this question: Isaac had\r\n     two sons, Esau and Jacob; who was Jacob's father? Scogin said to\r\n     his scholler, Thou foole and asse-head! Dost thou not know Tom\r\n     Miller of Oseney? Yes, said the scholler! Then, said Scogin, thou\r\n     knowest he had two sonnes, Tom and Jacke; who is Jacke's father?\r\n     The scholler said, Tom Miller. Why, said Scogin, thou mightest\r\n     have said that Isaac was Jacob's father. Then said Scogin, Thou\r\n     shalt arise betime in the morning, and carry a letter to the\r\n     ordinary, and I trust he will admit thee before the orders shall\r\n     be given. The scholler rose up betime in the morning, and carried\r\n     the letter to the ordinary. The ordinary said, For Master Scogin's\r\n     sake I will oppose you no farther than I did yesterday. Isaac had\r\n     two sons, Esau and Jacob; who was Jacob's father? Marry, said the\r\n     scholler, I can tell you now that was Tom Miller of Oseney. Goe,\r\n     foole, goe, said the ordinary, and let thy master send thee no\r\n     more to me for orders, for it is impossible to make a foole a wise\r\n     man.\"\r\n\r\nScogin's scholar was, however, made a priest, and some of the stories\r\nwhich follow describe the ludicrous manner in which he exercised the\r\npriesthood. Two other stories illustrate Scogin's supposed position at\r\ncourt:--\r\n\r\n     \"_How Scogin told those that mocked him that he had a wall-eye._\r\n\r\n     \"Scogin went up and down in the king's hall, and his hosen hung\r\n     downe, and his coat stood awry, and his hat stood a boonjour, so\r\n     every man did mocke Scogin. Some said he was a proper man, and did\r\n     wear his rayment cleanly; some said the foole could not put on his\r\n     owne rayment; some said one thing, and some said another. At last\r\n     Scogin said, Masters, you have praised me wel, but you did not\r\n     espy one thing in me. What is that, Tom? said the men. Marry, said\r\n     Scogin, I have a wall-eye. What meanest thou by that? said the\r\n     men. Marry, said Scogin, I have spyed a sort of knaves that doe\r\n     mocke me, and are worse fooles themselves.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_How Scogin drew his sonne up and downe the court._\r\n\r\n     \"After this Scogin went from the court, and put off his foole's\r\n     garments, and came to the court like an honest man, and brought\r\n     his son to the court with him, and within the court he drew his\r\n     sonne up and downe by the heeles. The boy cried out, and Scogin\r\n     drew the boy in every corner. At last every body had pity on the\r\n     boy, and said, Sir, what doe you meane, to draw the boy about the\r\n     court? Masters, said Scogin, he is my sonne, and I doe it for this\r\n     cause. Every man doth say, that man or child which is drawne up in\r\n     the court shall be the better as long as hee lives; and therefore\r\n     I will every day once draw him up and downe the court, after that\r\n     hee may come to preferment in the end.\"\r\n\r\nThe appreciation of a good joke cannot at this time have been very\r\ngreat or very general, for Scogin's jests were wonderfully popular\r\nduring at least a century, from the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. They passed through many editions, and are frequently\r\nalluded to by the writers of the Elizabethan age. The next individual\r\nwhose name appears at the head of a collection of his jests, was the\r\nwell-known wit, Richard Tarlton, who may be fairly considered as court\r\nfool to Queen Elizabeth. His jests belong to the same class as those\r\nof Skelton and Scogin, and if possible, they present a still greater\r\namount of dulness. Tarlton's jests were soon followed by the \"merrie\r\nconceited jests\" of George Peele, the dramatist, who is described in\r\nthe title as \"gentleman, sometimes student in Oxford;\" and it is added\r\nthat in these jests \"is shewed the course of his life, how he lived;\r\na man very well knowne in the city of London and elsewhere.\" In fact,\r\nPeele's jests are chiefly curious for the striking picture they give\r\nus of the wilder shades of town life under the reigns of Elizabeth and\r\nJames I.\r\n\r\nDuring the period which witnessed the publication in England of these\r\nbooks, many other jest-books appeared, for they had already become\r\nan important class of English popular literature. Most of them were\r\npublished anonymously, and indeed they are mere compilations from the\r\nolder collections in Latin and French. All that was at all good, even\r\nin the jests of Skelton, Scogin, Tarlton, and Peele, had been repeated\r\nover and over again by the story-tellers and jesters of former ages.\r\nTwo of the earlier English collections have gained a greater celebrity\r\nthan the rest, chiefly through adventitious circumstances. One of\r\nthese, entitled \"A Hundred Merry Tales,\" has gained distinction among\r\nShakespearian critics as the one especially alluded to by the great\r\npoet in \"Much Ado about Nothing,\" (Act ii., Sc. 1), where Beatrice\r\ncomplains that somebody had said \"that I had my good wit out of the\r\nHundred Merry Tales.\" The other collection alluded to was entitled\r\n\"Mery Tales, Wittie Questions, and Quicke Answeres, very pleasant\r\nto be readde,\" and was printed in 1567. Its modern fame appears to\r\nhave arisen chiefly from the circumstance that, until the accidental\r\ndiscovery of the unique and imperfect copy of the \"Hundred Merry\r\nTales,\" it was supposed to be the book alluded to by Shakespeare.\r\nBoth these collections are mere compilations from the \"Cent Nouvelles\r\nNouvelles,\" \"Poggio,\" \"Straparola,\" and other foreign works.[77] The\r\nwords put into the mouth of Beatrice are correctly descriptive of the\r\nuse made of these jest-books. It had become fashionable to learn out\r\nof them jests and stories, in order to introduce them into polite\r\nconversation, and especially at table; and this practice continued\r\nto prevail until a very recent period. The number of such jest-books\r\npublished during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries,\r\nwas quite extraordinary. Many of these were given anonymously; but many\r\nalso were put forth under names which possessed temporary celebrity,\r\nsuch as Hobson the carrier, Killigrew the jester, the friend of Charles\r\nII., Ben Jonson, Garrick, and a multitude of others. It is, perhaps,\r\nunnecessary to remind the reader that the great modern representative\r\nof this class of literature is the illustrious Joe Miller.\r\n\r\n [77] A neat and useful edition of these two jest-books, with the\r\n      other most curious books of the same class, published during the\r\n      Elizabethan period, has recently been published in two volumes,\r\n      by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  THE AGE OF THE REFORMATION.--THOMAS MURNER; HIS GENERAL\r\n     SATIRES.--FRUITFULNESS OF FOLLY.--HANS SACHS.--THE TRAP FOR\r\n     FOOLS.--ATTACKS ON LUTHER.--THE POPE AS ANTICHRIST.--THE POPE-ASS\r\n     AND THE MONK-CALF.--OTHER CARICATURES AGAINST THE POPE.--THE GOOD\r\n     AND BAD SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Folly did not pass away with the fifteenth century--on the\r\nwhole the sixteenth century can hardly be said to have been more sane\r\nthan its predecessor, but it was agitated by a long and fierce struggle\r\nto disengage European society from the trammels of the middle ages. We\r\nhave entered upon what is technically termed the _renaissance_, and\r\nare approaching the great religious reformation. The period during\r\nwhich the art of printing began first to spread generally over Western\r\nEurope, was peculiarly favourable to the production of satirical\r\nbooks and pamphlets, and a considerable number of clever and spirited\r\nsatirists and comic writers appeared towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, especially in Germany, where circumstances of a political\r\ncharacter had at an early period given to the intellectual agitation\r\na more permanent strength than it could easily or quickly gain in the\r\ngreat monarchies. Among the more remarkable of these satirists was\r\nThomas Murner, who was born at Strasburg, in 1475. The circumstances\r\neven of his childhood are singular, for he was born a cripple, or\r\nbecame one in his earliest infancy, though he was subsequently healed,\r\nand it was so universally believed that this malady was the effect\r\nof witchcraft, that he himself wrote afterwards a treatise upon this\r\nsubject under the title of \"De Phitonico Contractu.\" The school in\r\nwhich he was taught may at least have encouraged his satirical spirit,\r\nfor his master was Jacob Locher, the same who translated into Latin\r\nverse the \"Ship of Fools\" of Sebastian Brandt. At the end of the\r\ncentury Murner had become a master of arts in the University of Paris,\r\nand had entered the Franciscan order. His reputation as a German\r\npopular poet was so great, that the emperor Maximilian[&nbsp;]I., who\r\ndied in 1519, conferred upon him the crown of poetry, or, in other\r\nwords, made him poet-laureat. He took the degree of doctor in theology\r\nin 1509. Still Murner was known best as the popular writer, and he\r\npublished several satirical poems, which were remarkable for the bold\r\nwoodcuts that illustrated them, for engraving on wood flourished at\r\nthis period. He exposed the corruptions of all classes of society,\r\nand, before the Reformation broke out, he did not even spare the\r\ncorruptions of the ecclesiastical state, but soon declared himself a\r\nfierce opponent of the Reformers. When the Lutheran revolt against the\r\nPapacy became strong, our king, Henry VIII., who took a decided part\r\nagainst Luther, invited Murner to England, and on his return to his\r\nown country, the satiric Franciscan became more bitter against the\r\nReformation than ever. He advocated the cause of the English monarch in\r\na pamphlet, now very rare, in which he discussed the question whether\r\nHenry VIII. or Luther was the liar--\"Antwort dem Murner uff seine\r\nfrag, ob der künig von Engllant ein Lügner sey oder Martinus Luther.\"\r\nMurner appears to have divided the people of his age into rogues and\r\nfools, or perhaps he considered the two titles as identical. His\r\n\"Narrenbeschwerung,\" or Conspiracy of Fools, in which Brandt's idea\r\nwas followed up, is supposed to have been published as early as 1506,\r\nbut the first printed edition with a date, appeared in 1512. It became\r\nso popular, that it went through several editions during subsequent\r\nyears; and that which I have before me was printed at Strasburg in\r\n1518. It is, like Brandt's \"Ship of Fools,\" a general satire against\r\nsociety, in which the clergy are not spared, for the writer had not yet\r\ncome in face of Luther's Reformation. The cuts are superior to those\r\nof Brandt's book, and some of them are remarkable for their design and\r\nexecution. In one of the earliest of them, copied in the cut No. 139,\r\nFolly is introduced in the garb of a husbandman, scattering his feed\r\nover the earth, the result of which is a very quick and flourishing\r\ncrop, the fool's heads rising above ground, almost instantaneously,\r\nlike so many turnips. In a subsequent engraving, represented in our\r\ncut No. 140, Folly holds out, as an object of emulation, the fool's\r\ncap, and people of all classes, the pope himself, and the emperor, and\r\nall the great dignitaries of this world, press forward eagerly to seize\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 139. Sowing a Fruitful Crop._]\r\n\r\nThe same year (1512) witnessed the appearance of another poetical,\r\nor at least metrical, satire by Murner, entitled \"Schelmenzunft,\" or\r\nthe Confraternity of Rogues, similarly illustrated with very spirited\r\nengravings on wood. It is another demonstration of the prevailing\r\ndominion of folly under its worst forms, and the satire is equally\r\ngeneral with the preceding. Murner's satire appears to have been felt\r\nnot only generally, but personally; and we are told that he was often\r\nthreatened with assassination, and he raised up a number of literary\r\nopponents, who treated him with no little rudeness; in fact, he had\r\ngot on the wrong side of politics, or at all events on the unpopular\r\nside, and men who had more talents and greater weight appeared as his\r\nopponents--men like Ulrich von Utten, and Luther himself.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 140. An Acceptable Offering._]\r\n\r\nAmong the satirists who espoused the cause to which Murner was\r\nopposed, we must not overlook a man who represented in its strongest\r\nfeatures, though in a rather debased form, the old spontaneous poetry\r\nof the middle ages. His name was Hans Sachs, at least that was the\r\nname under which he was known, for his real name is said to have\r\nbeen Loutrdorffer. His spirit was entirely that of the old wandering\r\nminstrel, and it was so powerful in him, that, having been apprenticed\r\nto the craft of a weaver, he was no sooner freed from his indentures,\r\nthan he took to a vagabond life, and wandered from town to town,\r\ngaining his living by singing the verses he composed upon every\r\noccasion which presented itself. In 1519, he married and settled in\r\nNüremberg, and his compositions were then given to the public through\r\nthe press. The number of these was quite extraordinary--songs, ballads,\r\nsatires, and dramatic pieces, rude in style, in accordance with the\r\ntaste of the time, but full of cleverness. Many of them were printed\r\non broadsides, and illustrated with large engravings on wood. Hans\r\nSachs joined in the crusade against the empire of Folly, and one of\r\nhis broadsides is illustrated with a graceful design, the greater part\r\nof which is copied in our cut No. 141. A party of ladies have set a\r\nbird-trap to catch the fools of the age, who are waiting to be caught.\r\nOne fool is taken in the trap, while another is already secured and\r\npinioned, and others are rushing into the snare. A number of people of\r\nthe world, high in their dignities and stations, are looking on at this\r\nremarkable scene.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 141. Bird-Traps._]\r\n\r\nThe evil influence of the female sex was at this time proverbial, and,\r\nin fact, it was an age of extreme licentiousness. Another poet-laureat\r\nof the time, Henricus Bebelius, born in the latter half of the\r\nfifteenth century, and rather well known in the literature of his time,\r\npublished, in 1515, a satirical poem in Latin, under the title of\r\n\"Triumphus Veneris,\" which was a sort of exposition of the generally\r\nlicentious character of the age in which he lived. It is distributed\r\ninto six books, in the third of which the poet attacks the whole\r\necclesiastical state, not sparing the pope himself, and we are thereby\r\nperfectly well initiated into the weaknesses of the clergy. Bebelius\r\nhad been preceded by another writer on this part of the subject, and we\r\nmight say by many, for the incontinence of monks and nuns, and indeed\r\nof all the clergy, had long been a subject of satire. But the writer to\r\nwhom I especially allude was named Paulus Olearius, his name in German\r\nbeing Oelschlägel. He published, about the year 1500, a satirical\r\ntract, under the title of \"De Fide Concubinarum in Sacerdotes.\" It\r\nwas a bitter attack on the licentiousness of the clergy, and was\r\nrendered more effective by the engravings which accompanied it. We\r\ngive one of these as a curious picture of contemporary manners; the\r\nindividual who comes within the range of the lady's attractions, though\r\nhe may be a scholar, has none of the characteristics of a priest. She\r\npresents a nosegay, which we may suppose to represent the influence of\r\nperfume upon the senses; but the love of the ladies for pet animals\r\nis especially typified in the monkey, attached by a chain. A donkey\r\nappears to show by his heels his contempt for the lover.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 142. Courtship._]\r\n\r\nFrom an early period, the Roman church had been accustomed to\r\ntreat contemptuously, as well as cruelly, all who dissented from\r\nits doctrines, or objected to its government, and this feeling was\r\ncontinued down to the age of the Reformation, in spite of the tone\r\nof liberalism which was beginning to shine forth in the writings\r\nof some of its greatest ornaments. Some research among the dusty,\r\nbecause little used, records of national archives and libraries would\r\nno doubt bring to light more than one singular caricature upon the\r\n\"heretics\" of the middle ages, and my attention has been called to one\r\nwhich is possessed of peculiar interest. There is, among the imperial\r\narchives of France, in Paris, among records relating to the country of\r\nthe Albigeois in the thirteenth century, a copy of the bull of pope\r\nInnocent IV. giving directions for the proceedings against dissenters\r\nfrom Romanism, on the back of which the scribe, as a mark of his\r\ncontempt for these arch-heretics of the south, has drawn a caricature\r\nof a woman bound to a stake over the fire which is to burn her as an\r\nopen opponent of the church of Rome. The choice of a woman for the\r\nvictim was perhaps intended to show that the proselytism of heresy was\r\nespecially successful among the weaker sex, or that it was considered\r\nas having some relation to witchcraft. It is, by a long period, the\r\nearliest known pictorial representation of the punishment of burning\r\ninflicted on a heretic.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 143. Burning a Heretic._]\r\n\r\nThe shafts of satire were early employed against Luther and his new\r\nprinciples, and men like Murner, already mentioned, Emser, Cochlæus,\r\nand others, signalised themselves by their zeal in the papal cause.\r\nAs already stated, Murner distinguished himself as the literary ally\r\nof our king Henry VIII. The taste for satirical writings had then\r\nbecome so general, that Murner complains in one of his satires that\r\nthe printers would print nothing but abusive or satirical works, and\r\nneglected his more serious writings.\r\n\r\n          _Da sindt die trucker schuld daran,\r\n          Die trucken als die Gauchereien,\r\n          Und lassen mein ernstliche bücher leihen._\r\n\r\nSome of Murner's writings against Luther, most of which are now very\r\nrare, are extremely violent, and they are generally illustrated with\r\nsatirical woodcuts. One of these books, printed without name of place\r\nor date, is entitled, \"Of the great Lutheran Fool, how Doctor Murner\r\nhas exorcised him\" (_Von dem grossen Lutherisschen Narren, wie in\r\nDoctor Murner beschworen hat_). In the woodcuts to this book Murner\r\nhimself is introduced, as is usually the case in these satirical\r\nengravings, under the character of a Franciscan friar, with the head of\r\na cat, while Luther appears as a fat and jolly monk, wearing a fool's\r\ncap, and figuring in various ridiculous circumstances. In one of the\r\nfirst woodcuts, the cat Franciscan is drawing a rope so tight round the\r\ngreat Lutheran fool's neck, that he compels him to disgorge a multitude\r\nof smaller fools. In another the great Lutheran fool has his purse, or\r\npouch, full of little fools suspended at his girdle. This latter figure\r\nis copied in the cut No. 144, as an example of the form under which the\r\ngreat reformer appears in these satirical representations.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 144. Folly in Monastic Habit._]\r\n\r\nIn a few other caricatures of this period which have been preserved,\r\nthe apostle of the Reformation is attacked still more savagely. The\r\none here given (Fig. 145), taken from a contemporary engraving on\r\nwood, presents a rather fantastic figure of the demon playing on the\r\nbagpipes. The instrument is formed of Luther's head, the pipe through\r\nwhich the devil blows entering his ear, and that through which the\r\nmusic is produced forming an elongation of the reformer's nose. It was\r\na broad intimation that Luther was a mere tool of the evil one, created\r\nfor the purpose of bringing mischief into the world.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 145. The Music of the Demon._]\r\n\r\nThe reformers, however, were more than a match for their opponents in\r\nthis sort of warfare. Luther himself was full of comic and satiric\r\nhumour, and a mass of the talent of that age was ranged on his side,\r\nboth literary and artistic. After the reformer's marriage, the papal\r\nparty quoted the old legend, that Antichrist was to be born of the\r\nunion of a monk and a nun, and it was intimated that if Luther himself\r\ncould not be directly identified with Antichrist, he had, at least, a\r\nfair chance of becoming his parent. But the reformers had resolved, on\r\nwhat appeared to be much more conclusive evidence, that Antichrist was\r\nonly emblematical of the papacy, that under this form he had been long\r\ndominant on earth, and that the end of his reign was then approaching.\r\nA remarkable pamphlet, designed to place this idea pictorially before\r\nthe public, was produced from the pencil of Luther's friend, the\r\ncelebrated painter, Lucas Cranach, and appeared in the year 1521 under\r\nthe title of \"The Passionale of Christ and Antichrist\" (_Passional\r\nChristi und Antichristi_). It is a small quarto, each page of which is\r\nnearly filled by a woodcut, having a few lines of explanation in German\r\nbelow. The cut to the left represents some incident in the life of\r\nChrist, while that facing it to the right gives a contrasting fact in\r\nthe history of papal tyranny. Thus the first cut on the left represents\r\nJesus in His humility, refusing earthly dignities and power, while on\r\nthe adjoining page we see the pope, with his cardinals and bishops,\r\nsupported by his hosts of warriors, his cannon, and his fortifications,\r\nin his temporal dominion over secular princes. When we open again we\r\nsee on one side Christ crowned with thorns by the insulting soldiery,\r\nand on the other the pope, enthroned in all his worldly glory, exacting\r\nthe worship of his courtiers. On another we have Christ washing the\r\nfeet of His disciples, and in contrast the pope compelling the emperor\r\nto kiss his toe. And so on, through a number of curious illustrations,\r\nuntil at last we come to Christ's ascension into heaven, in contrast\r\nwith which a troop of demons, of the most varied and singular forms,\r\nhave seized upon the papal Antichrist, and are casting him down into\r\nthe flames of hell, where some of his own monks wait to receive him.\r\nThis last picture is drawn with so much spirit, that I have copied it\r\nin the cut No. 146.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 146. The Descent of the Pope._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 147. The Pope-ass._]\r\n\r\nThe monstrous figures of animals which had amused the sculptors and\r\nminiaturists of an earlier period came in time to be looked upon\r\nas realities, and were not only regarded with wonder as physical\r\ndeformities, but were objects of superstition, for they were believed\r\nto be sent into the world as warnings of great revolutions and\r\ncalamities. During the age preceding the Reformation, the reports\r\nof the births or discoveries of such monsters were very common, and\r\nengravings of them were no doubt profitable articles of merchandise\r\namong the early book-hawkers. Two of these were very celebrated in\r\nthe time of the Reformation, the Pope-ass and the Monk-calf, and were\r\npublished and republished with an explanation under the names of\r\nLuther and Melancthon, which made them emblematical of the Papacy and\r\nof the abuses of the Romish church, and, of course, prognostications\r\nof their approaching exposure and fall. It was pretended that the\r\nPope-ass was found dead in the river Tiber, at Rome, in the year\r\n1496. It is represented in our cut No. 147, taken from an engraving\r\npreserved in a very curious volume of broadside Lutheran caricatures,\r\nin the library of the British Museum, all belonging to the year 1545,\r\nthough this design had been published many years before. The head of\r\nan ass, we are told, represented the pope himself, with his false and\r\ncarnal doctrines. The right hand resembled the foot of an elephant,\r\nsignifying the spiritual power of the pope, which was heavy, and\r\nstamped down and crushed people's consciences. The left hand was that\r\nof a man, signifying the worldly power of the pope, which grasped at\r\nuniversal empire over kings and princes. The right foot was that of\r\nan ox, signifying the spiritual ministers of the papacy, the doctors\r\nof the church, the preachers, confessors, and scholastic theologians,\r\nand especially the monks and nuns, those who aided and supported\r\nthe pope in oppressing people's bodies and souls. The left foot was\r\nthat of a griffin, an animal which, when it once seizes its prey,\r\nnever lets it escape, and signified the canonists, the monsters of\r\nthe pope's temporal power, who grasped people's temporal goods, and\r\nnever returned them. The breast and belly of this monster were those\r\nof a woman, and signified the papal body, the cardinals, bishops,\r\npriests, monks, &c., who spent their lives in eating, drinking, and\r\nincontinence; and this part of the body was naked, because the popish\r\nclergy were not ashamed to expose their vices to the public. The legs,\r\narms, and neck, on the contrary, were clothed with fishes' scales;\r\nthese signified the temporal princes and lords, who were mostly in\r\nalliance with the papacy. The old man's head behind the monster, meant\r\nthat the papacy had become old, and was approaching its end; and\r\nthe head of a dragon, vomiting flames, which served for a tail, was\r\nsignificative of the great threats, the venomous horrible bulls and\r\nblasphemous writings, which the pontiff and his ministers, enraged at\r\nseeing their end approach, were launching into the world against all\r\nwho opposed them. These explanations were supported by apt quotations\r\nfrom the Scriptures, and were so effective, and became so popular, that\r\nthe picture was published in various shapes, and was seen adorning the\r\nwalls of the humblest cottages. I believe it is still to be met with in\r\na similar position in some parts of Germany. It was considered at the\r\ntime to be a masterly piece of satire. The picture of the Monk-calf,\r\nwhich is represented in our cut No. 148, was published at the same\r\ntime, and usually accompanies it. This monster is said to have been\r\nborn at Freyburg, in Misnia, and is simply a rather coarse emblem of\r\nthe monachal character.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 148. The Monk-Calf._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 149. The Head of the Papacy._]\r\n\r\nThe volume of caricatures just mentioned contains several satires on\r\nthe pope, which are all very severe, and many of them clever. One has\r\na movable leaf, which covers the upper part of the picture; when it is\r\ndown, we have a representation of the pope in his ceremonial robes,\r\nand over it the inscription ALEX · VI · PONT · MAX. Pope Alexander VI.\r\nwas the infamous Roderic Borgia, a man stained with all the crimes\r\nand vices which strike most horror into men's minds. When the leaf is\r\nraised, another figure joins itself with the lower part of the former,\r\nand represents a papal demon, crowned, the cross being transformed into\r\nan instrument of infernal punishment. This figure is represented in our\r\ncut No. 149. Above it are inscribed the words EGO · SVM · PAPA, \"I am\r\nthe Pope.\" Attached to it is a page of explanation in German, in which\r\nthe legend of that pope's death is given, a legend that his wicked\r\nlife appeared sufficient to sanction. It was said that, distrusting\r\nthe success of his intrigues to secure the papacy for himself, he\r\napplied himself to the study of the black art, and sold himself to\r\nthe Evil One. He then asked the tempter if it were his destiny to be\r\npope, and received an answer in the affirmative. He next inquired how\r\nlong he should hold the papacy, but Satan returned an equivocal and\r\ndeceptive answer, for Borgia understood that he was to be pope fifteen\r\nyears, whereas he died at the end of eleven. It is well known that\r\nPope Alexander VI. died suddenly and unexpectedly through accidentally\r\ndrinking the poisoned wine he had prepared with his own hand for the\r\nmurder of another man.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 150. The Pope's Nurse._]\r\n\r\nAn Italian theatine wrote a poem against the Reformation, in which\r\nhe made Luther the offspring of Megæra, one of the furies, who is\r\nrepresented as having been sent from hell into Germany to be delivered\r\nof him. This sarcasm was thrown back upon the pope with much greater\r\neffect by the Lutheran caricaturists. One of the plates in the\r\nabove-mentioned volume represents the \"birth and origin of the pope\"\r\n(_ortus et origo papæ_), making the pope identical with Antichrist.\r\nIn different groups, in this rather elaborate design, the child is\r\nrepresented as attended by the three furies, Megæra acting as his\r\nwet-nurse, Alecto as nursery-maid, and Tisiphone in another capacity,\r\n&c. The name of Martin Luther is added to this caricature also.\r\n\r\n          _Hie wird geborn der Widerchrist.\r\n          Megera sein Seugamme ist;\r\n          Alecto sein Keindermeidlin,\r\n          Tisiphone die gengelt in._--M. Luth., D. 1545.\r\n\r\nOne of the groups in this plate, representing the fury Megæra, a\r\nbecoming foster-mother, suckling the pope-infant, is given in our cut,\r\nNo. 150.\r\n\r\nIn another of these caricatures the pope is represented trampling on\r\nthe emperor, to show the manner in which he usurped and tyrannised\r\nover the temporal power. Another illustrates \"the kingdom of Satan and\r\nthe Pope\" (_regnum Satanæ et Papæ_), and the latter is represented\r\nas presiding over hell-mouth in all his state. One, given in our cut\r\nNo. 151, represents the pope under the form of an ass playing on the\r\nbagpipes, and is entitled _Papa doctor theologiæ et magister fidei_.\r\nFour lines of German verse beneath the engraving state how \"the pope\r\ncan alone expound Scripture and purge error, just as the ass alone can\r\npipe and touch the notes correctly.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 151. The Pope giving the Tune._]\r\n\r\n          _Der Bapst kan allein auslegen\r\n          Die Schrifft, und irthum ausfegen;\r\n          Wie der esel allein pfeiffen\r\n          Kan, und die noten recht greiffen._--1545.\r\n\r\nThis was the last year of Luther's active labours. At the commencement\r\nof the year following he died at Eissleben, whither he had gone to\r\nattend the council of princes. These caricatures may perhaps be\r\nconsidered as so many proclamations of satisfaction and exultation in\r\nthe final triumph of the great reformer.\r\n\r\nBooks, pamphlets, and prints of this kind were multiplied to an\r\nextraordinary degree during the age of the Reformation, but the\r\nmajority of them were in the interest of the new movement. Luther's\r\nopponent, Eckius, complained of the infinite number of people who\r\ngained their living by wandering over all parts of Germany, and\r\nselling Lutheran books.[78] Among those who administered largely to\r\nthis circulation of polemic books was the poet of farces, comedies, and\r\nballads, Hans Sachs, already mentioned. Hans Sachs had in one poem,\r\npublished in 1535, celebrated Luther under the title of \"the Wittemberg\r\nNightingale:\"--\r\n\r\n          _Die Wittembergisch' Nachtigall,\r\n          Die man jetzt höret überall_;\r\n\r\nand described the effects of his song over all the other animals; and\r\nhe published, also in verse, what he called a Monument, or Lament, on\r\nhis death (\"Ein Denkmal oder Klagred' ob der Leiche Doktors Martin\r\nLuther\"). Among the numerous broadsides published by Hans Sachs, one\r\ncontains the very clever caricature of which we give a copy in our cut\r\nNo. 152. It is entitled \"Der gut Hirt und böss Hirt,\" the good shepherd\r\nand bad shepherd, and has for its text the opening verses of the tenth\r\nchapter of the gospel of St. John. The good and bad shepherds are,\r\nas may be supposed, Christ and the pope. The church is here pictured\r\nas a not very stately building; the entrance, especially, is a plain\r\nstructure of timber. Jesus said to the Pharisees, \"He that entereth not\r\nby the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the\r\nsame is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is\r\nthe shepherd of the flock.\" In the engraving, the pope, as the hireling\r\nshepherd, sits on the roof of the stateliest part of the building,\r\npointing out to the Christian flock the wrong way, and blessing the\r\nclimbers. Under him two men of worldly distinction are making their\r\nway into the church through a window; and on a roof below a friar is\r\npointing to the people the way up. At another window a monk holds\r\nout his arms to invite people up; and one in spectacles, no doubt\r\nemblematical of the doctors of the church, is looking out from an\r\nopening over the entrance door to watch the proceedings of the Good\r\nShepherd. To the right, on the papal side of the church, the lords\r\nand great men are bringing the people under their influence, till\r\nthey are stopped by the cardinals and bishops, who prevent them from\r\ngoing forward to the door and point out very energetically the way\r\nup the roof. At the door stands, the Saviour, as the good shepherd,\r\nwho has knocked, and the porter has opened it with his key. Christ's\r\ntrue teachers, the evangelists, show the way to the solitary man of\r\nworth who comes by this road, and who listens with calm attention to\r\nthe gospel teachers, while he opens his purse to bestow his charity\r\non the poor man by the road side. In the original engraving, in the\r\ndistance on the left, the Good Shepherd is seen followed by his flock,\r\nwho are obedient to his voice; on the right, the bad shepherd, who has\r\nostentatiously drawn up his sheep round the image of the cross, is\r\nabandoning them, and taking to flight on the approach of the wolf. \"He\r\nthat entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the\r\nporter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his own\r\nsheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own\r\nsheep he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his\r\nvoice.... But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own\r\nthe sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and\r\nfleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.\" (John x.\r\n2-4, 12.)\r\n\r\n [78] \"Infinitus jam erat numerus qui victum ex Lutheranis libris\r\n      quæritantes, in speciem bibliopolarum longe lateque per Germaniæ\r\n      provincias vagabantur.\"--Eck., p. 58.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 152. The Two Shepherds._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 153. Murner and Luther's Daughter._]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Luther is the subject of a rather large and elaborate\r\ncaricature, which is an engraving of great rarity, but a copy of it is\r\ngiven in Jaime's \"Musée de Caricature.\" Leo X. is represented seated\r\non his throne upon the edge of the abyss, into which his cardinals are\r\ntrying to prevent his falling; but their efforts are rendered vain by\r\nthe appearance of Luther on the other side supported by his principal\r\nadherents, and wielding the Bible as his weapon, and the pope is\r\noverthrown, in spite of the support he receives from a vast host of\r\npopish clergy, doctors, &c.\r\n\r\nThe popish writers against Luther charged him with vices for which\r\nthere was probably no foundation, and invented the most scandalous\r\nstories against him. They accused him, among other things, of\r\ndrunkenness and licentiousness. and there may, perhaps, be some\r\nallusion to the latter charge in our cut No. 153, which is taken from\r\none of the comic illustrations to Murner's book, \"Von dem grossen\r\nLutherischen Narren,\" which was published in 1522; but, at all events,\r\nit will serve as a specimen of these illustrations, and of Murner's\r\nfancy of representing himself with the head of a cat. In 1525, Luther\r\nmarried a nun who had turned Protestant and quitted her convent,\r\nnamed Catherine de Bora, and this became the signal to his opponents\r\nfor indulging in abusive songs, and satires, and caricatures, most\r\nof them too coarse and indelicate to be described in these pages.\r\nIn many of the caricatures made on this occasion, which are usually\r\nwoodcut illustrations to books written against the reformer, Luther is\r\nrepresented dancing with Catherine de Bora, or sitting at table with a\r\nglass in his hand. An engraving of this kind, which forms one of the\r\nillustrations to a work by Dr. Konrad Wimpina, one of the reformer's\r\nviolent opponents, represents Luther's marriage. It is divided into\r\nthree compartments; to the left, Luther, whom the Catholics always\r\nrepresented in the character of a monk, gives the marriage ring to\r\nCatherine de Bora, and above them, in a sort of aureole, is inscribed\r\nthe word _Vovete_; on the right appears the nuptial bed, with the\r\ncurtains drawn, and the inscription _Reddite_; and in the middle the\r\nmonk and nun are dancing joyously together, and over their heads we\r\nread the words--\r\n\r\n                        Discedat ab aris\r\n              Cui tulit hesterna gaudia nocte Venus.\r\n\r\nWhile Luther was heroically fighting the great fight of reform in\r\nGermany, the foundation of religious reform was laid in France by\r\nJohn Calvin, a man equally sincere and zealous in the cause, but of\r\na totally different temper, and he espoused doctrines and forms of\r\nchurch government which a Lutheran would not admit. Literary satire\r\nwas used with great effect by the French Calvinists against their\r\npopish opponents, but they have left us few caricatures or burlesque\r\nengravings of any kind; at least, very few belonging to the earlier\r\nperiod of their history. Jaime, in his \"Musée de Caricature,\" has given\r\na copy of a very rare plate, representing the pope struggling with\r\nLuther and Calvin, as his two assailants. Both are tearing the pope's\r\nhair, but it is Calvin who is here armed with the Bible, with which\r\nhe is striking at Luther, who is pulling him by the beard. The pope\r\nhas his hands upon their heads. This scene takes place in the choir of\r\na church, but I give here (cut No. 154) only the group of the three\r\ncombatants, intended to represent how the two great opponents to papal\r\ncorruptions were hostile at the same time to each other.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 154. Luther and Calvin._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  ORIGIN OF MEDIÆVAL FARCE AND MODERN COMEDY.--HROTSVITHA.--MEDIÆVAL\r\n     NOTIONS OF TERENCE.--THE EARLY RELIGIOUS PLAYS.--MYSTERIES AND\r\n     MIRACLE PLAYS.--THE FARCES.--THE DRAMA IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still another branch of literature which, however it may have\r\nbeen modified, has descended to us from the middle ages. It has been\r\nremarked more than once in the course of this book, that the theatre\r\nof the Romans perished in the transition from the empire to the middle\r\nages; but something in the shape of theatrical performances appears\r\nto be inseparable from society even in its most barbarous state, and\r\nwe soon trace among the peoples who had settled upon the ruins of the\r\nempire of Rome an approach towards a drama. It is worthy of remark,\r\ntoo, that the mediæval drama originated exactly in the same way as that\r\nof ancient Greece, that is, from religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ignorance of the ancient stage in the middle ages,\r\nthat the meaning of the word _comœdia_ was not understood. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon glossaries interpret the word by _racu_, a narrative,\r\nespecially an epic recital, and this was the sense in which it was\r\ngenerally taken until late in the fourteenth or the fifteenth century.\r\nIt is the sense in which it is used in the title of Dante's great poem,\r\nthe \"Divina Commedia.\" When the mediæval scholars became acquainted in\r\nmanuscripts with the comedies of Terence, they considered them only as\r\nfine examples of a particular sort of literary composition, as metrical\r\nnarratives in dialogue, and in this feeling they began to imitate them.\r\nOne of the first of these mediæval imitators was a lady. There lived\r\nin the tenth century a maiden of Saxony, named Hrotsvitha--a rather\r\nunfortunate name for one of her sex, for it means simply \"a loud noise\r\nof voices,\" or, as she explains it herself, in her Latin, _clamor\r\nvalidus_. Hrotsvitha, as was common enough among the ladies of those\r\ndays, had received a very learned education, and her Latin is very\r\nrespectable. About the middle of the tenth century, she became a nun\r\nin the very aristocratic Benedictine abbey of Gandesheim, in Saxony,\r\nthe abbesses of which were all princesses, and which had been founded\r\nonly a century before. She wrote in Latin verse a short history of\r\nthat religious house, but she is best known by seven pieces, which are\r\ncalled comedies (_comœdiæ_), and which consist simply of legends of\r\nsaints, told dialogue-wise, some in verse and some in prose. As may\r\nbe supposed, there is not much of real comedy in these compositions,\r\nalthough one of them, the Dulcitius, is treated in a style which\r\napproaches that of farce. It is the story of the martyrdom of the three\r\nvirgin saints--Agape, Chione, and Irene--who excite the lust of the\r\npersecutor Dulcitius; and it may be remarked, that in this \"comedy,\"\r\nand in that of Callimachus and one or two of the others, the lady\r\nHrotsvitha displays a knowledge of love-making and of the language of\r\nlove, which was hardly to be expected from a holy nun.[79]\r\n\r\n [79] Several editions of the writings of Hrotsvitha, texts and\r\n      translations, have been published of late years both in Germany\r\n      and in France, of which I may point out the following as most\r\n      useful and complete--\"Théatre de Hrotsvitha, Religieuse Allemande\r\n      du x^e siècle....par Charles Magnin,\" 8vo., Paris, 1845;\r\n      \"Hrotsvithæ Gandeshemensis, virginis et monialis Germanicæ, gente\r\n      Saxonica ortæ, Comœdias sex, ad fidem codicis Emmeranensis\r\n      typis expressas edidit.... J. Benedixen,\" 16mo., Lubecæ, 1857;\r\n      \"Die Werke der Hrotsvitha: Herausgegeben von Dr. K. A. Barack,\"\r\n      8vo., Nürnberg, 1858.\r\n\r\nHrotsvitha, in her preface, complains that, in spite of the general\r\nlove for the reading of the Scriptures, and contempt for everything\r\nderived from ancient paganism, people still too often read the\r\n\"fictions\" of Terence, and thus, seduced by the beauties of his style,\r\nsoiled their minds with the knowledge of the criminal acts which are\r\ndescribed in his writings. A rather early manuscript has preserved a\r\nvery curious fragment illustrative of the manner in which the comedies\r\nof the Romans were regarded by one class of people in the middle ages,\r\nand it has also a further meaning. Its form is that of a dialogue in\r\nLatin verse between Terence and a personage called in the original\r\n_delusor_, which was no doubt intended to express a performer of some\r\nkind, and may be probably considered as synonymous with _jougleur_. It\r\nis a contention between the new jouglerie of the middle ages and the\r\nold jouglerie of the schools, somewhat in the same style as the fabliau\r\nof \"Les deux Troveors Ribauz,\" described in a former chapter.[80] We\r\nare to suppose that the name of Terence has been in some way or other\r\nbrought forward in laudatory terms, upon which the jougleur steps\r\nforward from among the spectators and expresses himself towards the\r\nRoman writer very contemptuously. Terence then makes his appearance to\r\nspeak in his own defence, and the two go on abusing one another in no\r\nvery measured language. Terence asks his assailant who he is? to which\r\nthe other replies, \"If you ask who I am, I reply, I am better than\r\nthee. Thou art old and broken with years; I am a tyro, full of vigour,\r\nand in the force of youth. You are but a barren trunk, while I am a\r\ngood and fertile tree. If you hold your tongue, old fellow, it will be\r\nmuch better for you.\"\r\n\r\n        _Si rogitas quis sum, respondeo: te melior sum.\r\n        Tu vetus atque senex; ego tyro, valens, adulescens.\r\n        Tu sterilis truncus; ego fertilis arbor, opimus.\r\n        Si taceas, o vetule, lucrum tibi quæris enorme._\r\n\r\n     Terence replies:--\"What sense have you left? Are you, think you,\r\n     better than me? Let me see you, young as you are, compose what\r\n     I, however old and broken, will compose. If you be a good tree,\r\n     show us some proofs of your fertility. Although I may be a barren\r\n     trunk, I produce abundance of better fruit than thine.\"\r\n\r\n        _Quis tibi sensus inest? numquid melior me es?\r\n        Nunc vetus atque senex quæ fecero fac adolescens.\r\n        Si bonus arbor ades, qua fertilitate redundas?\r\n        Cum sim truncus iners, fructu meliore redundo._\r\n\r\nAnd so the dispute continues, but unfortunately the latter part has\r\nbeen lost with a leaf or two of the manuscript. I will only add that I\r\nthink the age of this curious piece has been overrated.[81]\r\n\r\n [80] See p. 191 of the present volume.\r\n\r\n [81] This singular composition was published with notes by M. de\r\n      Montaiglon, in a Parisian journal entitled, \"L'Amateur de\r\n      Livres,\" in 1849, under the title of \"Fragment d'un Dialogue\r\n      Latin du ix^e siècle entre Terence et un Bouffon.\" A few separate\r\n      copies were printed, of which I possess one.\r\n\r\nHrotsvitha is the earliest example we have of mediæval writers in this\r\nparticular class of literature. We find no other until the twelfth\r\ncentury, when two writers flourished named Vital of Blois (_Vitalis\r\nBlesensis_) and Matthew of Vendôme (_Matthæus Vindocinensis_), the\r\nauthors of several of the mediæval poems distinguished by the title of\r\n_comœdiæ_, which give us a clearer and more distinct idea of what\r\nwas meant by the word. They are written in Latin Elegiac verse, a form\r\nof composition which was very popular among the mediæval scholars, and\r\nconsist of stories told in dialogue. Hence Professor Osann, of Giessen,\r\nwho edited two of those of Vital of Blois, gives them the title of\r\neclogues (_eclogæ_). The name comedy is, however, given to them in\r\nmanuscripts, and it may perhaps admit of the following explanation.\r\nThese pieces seem to have been first mere abridgments of the plots of\r\nthe Roman comedies, especially those of Plautus, and the authors appear\r\nto have taken the Latin title of the original as applied to the plot,\r\nin the sense of a narrative, and not to its dramatic form. Of the two\r\n\"comedies\" by Vital of Blois, one is entitled \"Geta,\" and is taken from\r\nthe \"Amphytrio\" of Plautus, and the other, which in the manuscripts\r\nbears the title of \"Querulus,\" represents the \"Aulularia\" of the\r\nsame writer. Independent of the form of composition, the scholastic\r\nwriter has given a strangely mediæval turn to the incidents of the\r\nclassic story of Jupiter and Alcmena. Another similar \"comedy,\" that\r\nof Babio, which I first printed from the manuscripts, is still more\r\nmediæval in character. Its plot, perhaps taken from a fabliau, for the\r\nmediæval writers rarely invented stories, is as follows, although it\r\nmust be confessed that it comes out rather obscurely in the dialogue\r\nitself. Babio, the hero of the piece, is a priest, who, as was still\r\ncommon at that time (the twelfth century), has a wife, or, as the\r\nstrict religionists would then say, a concubine, named Pecula. She has\r\na daughter named Viola, with whom Babio is in love, and he pursues\r\nhis design upon her, of course unknown to his wife. Babio has also a\r\nman-servant named Fodius, who is engaged in a secret intrigue with\r\nhis mistress, Pecula, and also seeks to seduce her daughter, Viola.\r\nTo crown the whole, the lord of the manor, a knight named Croceus, is\r\nalso in love with Viola, though with more honourable designs. Here is\r\nsurely intrigue enough and a sufficient absence of morality to satisfy\r\na modern French novelist of the first water. At the opening of the\r\npiece, amid some by-play between the four individuals who form the\r\nhousehold of Babio, it is suddenly announced that Croceus is on his\r\nway to visit him, and a feast is hastily prepared for his reception.\r\nIt ends in the knight carrying away Viola by force. Babio, after a\r\nlittle vain bluster, consoles himself for the loss of the damsel with\r\nreflections on the virtue of his wife, Pecula, and the faithfulness of\r\nhis man, Fodius, when, at this moment, Fame carries to his ear reports\r\nwhich excite his suspicions against them. He adopts a stratagem very\r\nfrequently introduced in the mediæval stories, surprises the two lovers\r\nunder circumstances which leave no room for doubting their guilt, and\r\nthen forgives them, enters a monastery, and leaves them to themselves.\r\nIn form, these \"comedies\" are little more than scholastic exercises;\r\nbut, at a later period, we shall see the same stories adopted as the\r\nsubjects of farces.[82]\r\n\r\n [82] To judge by the number of copies found in manuscripts,\r\n      especially of the \"Geta,\" these dramatic poems must have enjoyed\r\n      considerable popularity. The \"Geta\" and the \"Querulus\" were\r\n      published in a volume entitled, \"Vitalis Blesensis Amphitryon et\r\n      Aulularia Eclogæ. Edidit Fridericus Osannus, Professor Gisensis,\"\r\n      8vo., Darmstadt, 1836. The \"Geta\" and the \"Babio\" are included\r\n      in my \"Early Mysteries, and other Latin Poems of the Twelfth and\r\n      Thirteenth Centuries.\"\r\n\r\nAlready, however, by the side of these dramatic poems, a real\r\ndrama--the drama of the middle ages--was gradually developing\r\nitself. As stated before, it arose, like the drama of the Greeks,\r\nout of the religious ceremonies. We know nothing of the existence of\r\nanything approaching to dramatic forms which may have existed among\r\nthe religious rites of the peoples of the Teutonic race before\r\ntheir conversion to Christianity, but the Christian clergy felt the\r\nnecessity of keeping up festive religious ceremonies in some form or\r\nother, and also of impressing upon people's imagination and memory by\r\nmeans of rude scenical representations some of the broader facts of\r\nscriptural and ecclesiastical history. These performances at first\r\nconsisted probably in mere dumb show, or at the most the performers\r\nmay have chanted the scriptural account of the transaction they were\r\nrepresenting. In this manner the choral boys, or the younger clergy,\r\nwould, on some special Saint's day, perform some striking act in\r\nthe life of the saint commemorated, or, on particular festivals of\r\nthe church, those incidents of gospel history to which the festival\r\nespecially related. By degrees, a rather more imposing character was\r\ngiven to these performances by the addition of a continuous dialogue,\r\nwhich, however, was written in Latin verse, and was no doubt chanted.\r\nThis incipient drama in Latin, as far as we know it, belongs to the\r\ntwelfth century, and is represented by a tolerably large number of\r\nexamples still preserved in mediæval manuscripts. Some of the earliest\r\nof these have for their author a pupil of the celebrated Abelard, named\r\nHilarius, who lived in the first half of the twelfth century, and is\r\nunderstood to have been by birth an Englishman. Hilarius appears before\r\nus as a playful Latin poet, and among a number of short pieces, which\r\nmay be almost called lyric, he has left us three of these religious\r\nplays. The subject of the first of these is the raising of Lazarus\r\nfrom the dead, the chief peculiarity of which consists of the songs of\r\nlamentation placed in the mouths of the two sisters of Lazarus, Mary\r\nand Martha. The second represents one of the miracles attributed to St.\r\nNicholas; and the third, the history of Daniel. The latter is longer\r\nand more elaborate than the others, and at its conclusion, the stage\r\ndirection tells us that, if it were performed at matins, Darius, king\r\nof the Medes and Persians, was to chant _Te Deum Laudamus_, but if it\r\nwere at vespers, the great king was to chant _Magnificat anima mea\r\nDominum_.[83]\r\n\r\n [83] \"Hilarii Versus et Ludi,\" 8vo., Paris, 1835. Edited by M.\r\n      Champollion Figeac.\r\n\r\nThat this mediæval drama was not derived from that of the Roman is\r\nevident from the circumstance that entirely new terms were applied\r\nto it. The western people in the middle ages had no words exactly\r\nequivalent with the Latin _comœdia_, _tragœdia_, _theatrum_, &c.;\r\nand even the Latinists, to designate the dramatic pieces performed\r\nat the church festivals, employed the word _ludus_, a play. The\r\nFrench called them by a word having exactly the same meaning, _jeu_\r\n(from _jocus_). Similarly in English they were termed _plays_. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon glossaries present as the representative of the Latin\r\n_theatrum_, the compounded words _plege-stow_, or _pleg-stow_, a\r\nplay-place, and _pleg-hus_, a play-house. It is curious that we\r\nEnglishmen have preferred to the present time the Anglo-Saxon words\r\nin _play_, _player_, and _play-house_. Another Anglo-Saxon word with\r\nexactly the same signification, _lac_, or _gelac_, play, appears to\r\nhave been more in use in the dialect of the Northumbrians, and a\r\nYorkshireman still calls a play a _lake_, and a player a _laker_. So\r\nalso the Germans called a dramatic performance a _spil_, _i.e._ a play,\r\nthe modern _spiel_, and a theatre, a _spil-hus_. One of the pieces of\r\nHilarius is thus entitled \"Ludus super iconia sancti Nicolai,\" and the\r\nFrench _jeu_ and the English _play_ are constantly used in the same\r\nsense. But besides this general term, words gradually came into use to\r\ncharacterise different sorts of plays. The church plays consisted of\r\ntwo descriptions of subjects, they either represented the miraculous\r\nacts of certain saints, which had a plain meaning, or some incident\r\ntaken from the Holy Scriptures, which was supposed to have a hidden\r\nmysterious signification as well as an apparent one, and hence the\r\none class of subject was usually spoken of simply as _miraculum_, a\r\nmiracle, and the other as _mysterium_, a mystery. _Mysteries_ and\r\n_miracle-plays_ are still the names usually given to the old religious\r\nplays by writers on the history of the stage.\r\n\r\nWe have a proof that the Latin religious plays, and the festivities\r\nin which they were employed, had become greatly developed in the\r\ntwelfth century, in the notice taken of them in the ecclesiastical\r\ncouncils of that period, for they were disapproved by the stricter\r\nchurch disciplinarians. So early as the papacy of Gregory VIII., the\r\npope urged the clergy to \"extirpate\" from their churches theatrical\r\nplays, and other festive practices which were not quite in harmony\r\nwith the sacred character of these buildings.[84] Such performances are\r\nforbidden by a council held at Treves in 1227.[85] We learn from the\r\nannals of the abbey of Corbei, published by Leibnitz, that the younger\r\nmonks at Heresburg performed on one occasion a \"sacred comedy\" (_sacram\r\ncomœdiam_) of the selling into captivity and the exaltation of\r\nJoseph, which was disapproved by the other heads of the order.[86] Such\r\nperformances are included in a proclamation of the bishop of Worms, in\r\n1316, against the various abuses which had crept into the festivities\r\nobserved in his diocese at Easter and St. John's tide.[87] Similar\r\nprohibitions of the acting of such plays in churches are met with at\r\nsubsequent periods.\r\n\r\n [84] \"Interdum ludi fiunt in ecclesiis theatrales,\" &c.--_Decret\r\n      Gregorii_, lib. iii. tit. i.\r\n\r\n [85] \"Item non permittant sacerdotes ludos theatrales fieri in\r\n      ecclesia et alios ludos inhonestos.\"\r\n\r\n [86] \"Juniores fratres in Heresburg sacram habuere comœdiam de\r\n      Josepho vendito et exalto, quod vero reliqui ordinis nostri\r\n      prælati male interpretati sunt.\"--_Leibn., Script. Brunsv._ tom.\r\n      ii. p. 311.\r\n\r\n [87] The acts of this synod of Worms are printed in Harzheim, tom. iv.\r\n      p. 258.\r\n\r\nWhile these performances were thus falling under the censure of the\r\nchurch authorities, they were taken up by the laity, and under their\r\nmanagement both the plays and the machinery for acting them underwent\r\nconsiderable extension. The municipal guilds contained in their\r\nconstitution a considerable amount of religious spirit. They were\r\ngreat benefactors of the churches in cities and municipal towns, and\r\nhad usually some parts of the sacred edifice appropriated to them,\r\nand they may, perhaps, have taken a part in these performances, while\r\nthey were still confined to the church. These guilds, and subsequently\r\nthe municipal corporations, took them entirely into their own hands.\r\nCertain annual religious festivals, and especially the feast of _Corpus\r\nChristi_, were still the occasions on which the plays were acted, but\r\nthey were taken entirely from the churches, and the performances took\r\nplace in the open streets. Each guild had its particular play, and\r\nthey acted on movable stages, which were dragged along the streets in\r\nthe procession of the guild. These stages appear to have been rather\r\ncomplicated. They were divided into three floors, that in the middle,\r\nwhich was the principal stage, representing this world, while the upper\r\ndivision represented heaven, and that at the bottom hell. The mediæval\r\nwriters in Latin called this machinery a _pegma_, from the Greek word\r\nπῆγμα, a scaffold; and they also applied to it, for a reason which\r\nis not is easily seen, unless the one word arose out of a corruption\r\nof the other, that of _pagina_, and from a further corruption of these\r\ncame into the French and English languages the word _pageant_, which\r\noriginally signified one of these movable stages, though it has since\r\nreceived secondary meanings which have a much wider application. Each\r\nguild in a town had its pageant and its own actors, who performed\r\nin masks and costumes, and each had one of a series of plays, which\r\nwere performed at places where they halted in the procession. The\r\nsubjects of these plays were taken from Scripture, and they usually\r\nformed a regular series of the principal histories of the Old and New\r\nTestaments. For this reason they were generally termed _mysteries_, a\r\ntitle already explained; and among the few series of these plays still\r\npreserved, we have the \"Coventry Mysteries,\" which were performed by\r\nthe guilds of that town, the \"Chester Mysteries,\" belonging to the\r\nguilds in the city of Chester, and the \"Towneley Mysteries,\" so called\r\nfrom the name of the possessor of the manuscript, but which probably\r\nbelonged to the guilds of Wakefield in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nDuring these changes in the method of performance, the plays themselves\r\nhad also been considerably modified. The simple Latin phrases, even\r\nwhen in rhyme, which formed the dialogue of the earlier _ludi_--as in\r\nthe four miracles of St. Nicholas, and the six Latin mysteries taken\r\nfrom the New Testament, printed in my volume of \"Early Mysteries and\r\nother Latin Poems\"--must have been very uninteresting to the mass of\r\nthe spectators, and an attempt was made to enliven them by introducing\r\namong the Latin phrases popular proverbs, or even sometimes a song\r\nin the vulgar tongue. Thus in the play of \"Lazarus\" by Hilarius, the\r\nLatin of the lamentations of his two sisters is intermixed with French\r\nverses. Such is the case also with the play of \"St. Nicholas\" by\r\nthe same writer, as well as with the curious mystery of the Foolish\r\nVirgins, printed in my \"Early Mysteries\" just alluded to, in which\r\nlatter the Latin is intermingled with Provençal verse. A much greater\r\nadvance was made when these performances were transferred to the\r\nguilds. The Latin was then discarded altogether, and the whole play\r\nwas written in French, or English, or German, as the case might be,\r\nthe plot was made more elaborate, and the dialogue greatly extended.\r\nBut now that the whole institution had become secularised, the want\r\nof something to amuse people--to make them laugh, as people liked to\r\nlaugh in the middle ages--was felt more than ever, and this want was\r\nsupplied by the introduction of droll and ludicrous scenes, which are\r\noften very slightly, if at all, connected with the subject of the play.\r\nIn one of the earliest of the French plays, that of \"St. Nicholas,\" by\r\nJean Bodel, the characters who form the burlesque scene are a party\r\nof gamblers in a tavern. In others, robbers, or peasants, or beggars\r\nform the comic scene, or vulgar women, or any personages who could be\r\nintroduced acting vulgarly and using coarse language, for these were\r\ngreat incitements to mirth among the populace.\r\n\r\nIn the English plays now remaining, these scenes are, on the whole,\r\nless frequent, and they are usually more closely connected with\r\nthe general subject. The earliest English collection that has been\r\npublished is that known as the \"Towneley Mysteries,\" the manuscript of\r\nwhich belongs to the fifteenth century, and the plays themselves may\r\nhave been composed in the latter part of the fourteenth. It contains\r\nthirty-two plays, beginning with the Creation, and ending with the\r\nAscension and the Day of Judgment, with two supplementary plays, the\r\n\"Raising of Lazarus\" and the \"Hanging of Judas.\" The play of \"Cain and\r\nAbel\" is throughout a vulgar drollery, in which Cain, who exhibits\r\nthe character of a blustering ruffian, is accompanied by a _garcio_,\r\nor lad, who is the very type of a vulgar and insolent horse-boy, and\r\nthe conversation of these two worthies reminds us a little of that\r\nbetween the clown and his master in the open-air performances of the\r\nold wandering mountebanks. Even the death of Abel by the hand of his\r\nbrother is performed in a manner calculated to provoke great laughter.\r\nIn the old mirthful spirit, to hear two persons load each other with\r\nvulgar abuse, was as good as seeing them grin through a horse-collar,\r\nif not better. Hence the droll scene in the play of \"Noah\" is a\r\ndomestic quarrel between Noah and his wife, who was proverbially a\r\nshrew, and here gives a tolerable example of abusive language, as it\r\nmight then come from a woman's tongue. The quarrel arises out of her\r\nobstinate refusal to go into the ark. In the New Testament series the\r\nplay of \"The Shepherds\" was one of those most susceptible of this sort\r\nof embellishment. There are two plays of the Shepherds in the \"Towneley\r\nMysteries,\" the first of which is amusing enough, as it represents,\r\nin clever burlesque, the acts and conversation of a party of mediæval\r\nshepherds guarding their flocks at night; but the second play of the\r\nShepherds is a much more remarkable example of a comic drama. The\r\nshepherds are introduced at the opening of the piece conversing very\r\nsatirically on the corruptions of the time, and complaining how the\r\npeople were impoverished by over-taxation, to support the pride and\r\nvanity of the aristocracy. After a good deal of very amusing talk, the\r\nshepherds, who, as usual, are three in number, agree to sing a song,\r\nand it is this song, it appears, which brings to them a fourth, named\r\nMak, who proves to be a sheep-stealer; and, in fact, no sooner have\r\nthe shepherds resigned themselves to sleep for the night, than Mak\r\nchooses one of the best sheep in their flocks, and carries it home\r\nto his hut. Knowing that he will be suspected of the theft, and that\r\nhe will soon be pursued, he is anxious to conceal the plunder, and\r\nis only helped out of his difficulty by his wife, who suggests that\r\nthe carcase shall be laid at the bottom of her cradle, and that she\r\nshall lie upon it and groan, pretending to be in labour. Meanwhile the\r\nshepherds awake, discover the loss of a sheep, and perceiving that Mak\r\nhas disappeared also, they naturally suspect him to be the depredator,\r\nand pursue him. They find everything very cunningly prepared in the\r\ncottage to deceive them, but, after a large amount of roundabout\r\ninquiry and research, and much drollery, they discover that the boy of\r\nwhich Mak's wife pretends to have been just delivered, is nothing else\r\nbut the sheep which had been stolen from their flocks. The wife still\r\nasserts that it is her child, and Mak sets up as his defence that the\r\nbaby had been \"forspoken,\" or enchanted, by an elf at midnight, and\r\nthat it had thus been changed into the appearance of a sheep; but the\r\nshepherds refuse to be satisfied with this explanation. The whole of\r\nthis little comedy is carried out with great skill, and with infinite\r\ndrollery. The shepherds, while still wrangling with Mak and his wife,\r\nare seized with drowsiness, and lie down to sleep; but they are aroused\r\nby the voice of the angel, who proclaims the birth of the Saviour. The\r\nnext play in which the drollery is introduced, is that of \"Herod and\r\nthe Slaughter of the Innocents.\" Herod's bluster and bombast, and the\r\nvulgar abuse which passes between the Hebrew mothers and the soldiers\r\nwho are murdering their children, are wonderfully laughable. The plays\r\nwhich represented the arrest, trial, and execution of Jesus, are all\r\nfull of drollery, for the grotesque character which had been given to\r\nthe demons in the earlier middle ages, appears to have been transferred\r\nto the executioners, or, as they were called, the \"tormentors,\" and\r\nthe language and manner in which they executed their duties, must have\r\nkept the audience in a continual roar of laughter. In the play of\r\n\"Doomsday,\" the fiends retained their old character, and the manner\r\nin which they joke over the distress of the sinful souls, and the\r\ndetails they give of their sinfulness, are equally mirth-provoking. The\r\n\"Coventry Mysteries\" are also printed from a manuscript of the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century, and are, perhaps, as old as the \"Towneley\r\nMysteries.\" They consist of forty-two plays, but they contain, on the\r\nwhole, fewer droll scenes than those of the Towneley collection. But\r\na very remarkable example is furnished in the play of the \"Trial of\r\nJoseph and Mary,\" which is a very grotesque picture of the proceedings\r\nin a mediæval consistory court. The sompnour, a character so well\r\nknown by Chaucer's picture of him, opens the piece by reading from his\r\nbook a long list of offenders against chastity. At its conclusion,\r\ntwo \"detractors\" make their appearance, who repeat various scandalous\r\nstories against the Virgin Mary and her husband Joseph, which are\r\noverheard by some of the high officers of the court, and Mary and\r\nJoseph are formally accused and placed upon their trial. The trial\r\nitself is a scene of low ribaldry, which can only have afforded\r\namusement to a very vulgar audience. There is a certain amount of the\r\nsame kind of indelicate drollery in the play of \"The Woman taken in\r\nAdultery,\" in this collection. The \"Chester Mysteries\" are still more\r\nsparing of such scenes, but they are printed from manuscripts written\r\nafter the Reformation, which had, perhaps, gone through the process\r\nof expurgation, in which such excrescences had been lopped off.\r\nHowever, in the play of \"Noah's Flood,\" we have the old quarrel between\r\nNoah and his wife, which is carried so far that the latter actually\r\nbeats her husband in the presence of the audience. There is a little\r\ndrollery in the play of \"The Shepherds,\" a considerable amount of what\r\nmay be called \"Billingsgate\" language in the play of the \"Slaughter\r\nof the Innocents,\" but less than the usual amount of insolence in the\r\ntormentors and demons.[88] It is probable, however, that these droll\r\nscenes were not always considered an integral part of the play in which\r\nthey were introduced, but that they were kept as separate subjects, to\r\nbe introduced at will, and not always in the same play, and therefore\r\nthat they were not copied with the play in the manuscripts.\r\n\r\n [88] The editions of the three principal collections of English\r\n      mysteries are--1. \"The Towneley Mysteries,\" 8vo., London,\r\n      1836, published by the Surtees Society; 2. \"Ludus Coventriæ: a\r\n      Collection of Mysteries, formerly represented at Coventry on the\r\n      Feast of Corpus Christi,\" edited by James Orchard Halliwell,\r\n      Esq., 8vo., London, 1841, published by the Shakespeare Society;\r\n      3. \"The Chester Plays: a Collection of Mysteries founded upon\r\n      Scriptural Subjects, and formerly represented by the Trades of\r\n      Chester at Whitsuntide,\" edited by Thomas Wright, Esq., 2 vols.\r\n      8vo., London, 1843 and 1847, published by the Shakespeare Society.\r\n\r\nIn the Coventry play of \"Noah's Flood,\" when Noah has received the\r\ndirections from an angel for the building of the ark, he leaves the\r\nstage to proceed to this important work. On his departure, Lamech comes\r\nforward, blind and led by a youth, who directs his hand to shoot at a\r\nbeast concealed in a bush. Lamech shoots, and kills Cain, upon which,\r\nin his anger, he beats the youth to death, and laments the misfortune\r\ninto which the latter has led him. This was the legendary explanation\r\nof the passage in the fourth chapter of Genesis: \"And Lamech said ...\r\nI have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt; if Cain\r\nshall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.\" It\r\nis evident that this is a piece of scriptural story which has nothing\r\nto do with Noah's flood, and accordingly, in the Coventry play, we\r\nare told in the stage directions, that it was introduced in the place\r\nof the \"interlude,\"[89] as if there were a place in the machinery of\r\nthe pageant where the episode, which was not an integral part of the\r\nsubject, was performed, and that this part of the performance was\r\ncalled an interlude, or play introduced in the interval of the action\r\nof the main subject. The word _interlude_ remained long in our language\r\nas applied to such short and simple dramatic pieces as we may suppose\r\nto have formed the drolleries of the mysteries. But they had another\r\nname in France which has had a greater and more lulling celebrity.\r\nIn one of the early French miracle-plays, that of \"St. Fiacre,\" an\r\ninterlude of this kind is introduced, containing five personages--a\r\nbrigand or robber, a peasant, a sergeant, and the wives of the two\r\nlatter. The brigand, meeting the peasant on the highway, asks the way\r\nto St. Omer, and receives a clownish answer, which is followed by one\r\nequally rude on a second question. The brigand, in revenge, steals\r\nthe peasant's capon, but the sergeant comes up at this moment and,\r\nattempting to arrest the thief, receives a blow from the latter which\r\nis supposed to break his right arm. The brigand thus escapes, and the\r\npeasant and the sergeant quit the scene, which is immediately occupied\r\nby their wives. The sergeant's wife is informed by the other of the\r\ninjury sustained by her husband, and she exults over it because it will\r\ndeprive him of the power of beating her. They then proceed to a tavern,\r\ncall for wine, and make merry, the conversation turning upon the faults\r\nof their respective husbands, who are not spared. In the midst of\r\ntheir enjoyments, the two husbands return, and show, by beating their\r\nwives, that they are not very greatly disabled. In the manuscript of\r\nthe miracle-play of \"St. Fiacre,\" in which this amusing episode is\r\nintroduced, a marginal stage direction is expressed in the following\r\nwords, \"_cy est interposé une farsse_\" (here a farce is introduced).\r\nThis is one of the earliest instances of the application of the term\r\n_farce_ to these short dramatic facetiæ. Different opinions have been\r\nexpressed as to the origin of the word, but it seems most probable\r\nthat it is derived from an old French verb, _farcer_, to jest, to make\r\nmerry, whence the modern word _farceur_ for a joker, and that it thus\r\nmeans merely a drollery or merriment.\r\n\r\n [89] \"Hic transit Noe cum familia sua pro navi, quo exeunte, _locum\r\n      interludii subintret_ statim Lameth, conductus ab adolescente, et\r\n      dicens,\" &c.\r\n\r\nI have just suggested as a reason for the absence of these interludes,\r\nor farces, in the mysteries as they are found in the manuscripts,\r\nthat they were probably not looked upon as parts of the mysteries\r\nthemselves, but as separate pieces which might be used at pleasure.\r\nWhen we reach a certain period in their history, we find that not only\r\nwas this the case, but that these farces were performed separately and\r\naltogether independently of the religious plays. It is in France that\r\nwe find information which enables us to trace the gradual revolution\r\nin the mediæval drama. A society was formed towards the close of the\r\nfourteenth century under the title of _Confrères de la Passion_, who,\r\nin 1398, established a regular theatre at St. Maur-des-Fossés, and\r\nsubsequently obtained from Charles VI. a privilege to transport their\r\ntheatre into Paris, and to perform in it mysteries and miracle-plays.\r\nThey now rented of the monks of Hermières a hall in the hospital of the\r\nTrinity, outside of the Porte St. Denis, performing there regularly\r\non Sundays and saints' days, and probably making a good thing of it,\r\nfor, during a long period, they enjoyed great popularity. Gradually,\r\nhowever, this popularity was so much diminished, that the _confrères_\r\nwere obliged to have recourse to expedients for reviving it. Meanwhile\r\nother similar societies had arisen into importance. The clerks of\r\nthe Bazoche, or lawyers' clerks of the Palais de Justice, had thus\r\nassociated together, it is said, as early as the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, and they distinguished themselves by composing\r\nand performing farces, for which they appear to have obtained a\r\nprivilege. Towards the close of the fourteenth century, there arose\r\nin Paris another society, which took the name of _Enfans sans souci_,\r\nor Careless Boys, who elected a president or chief with the title\r\nof _Prince des Sots_, or King of the Fools, and who composed a sort\r\nof dramatic satires which they called _Sotties_. Jealousies soon\r\narose between these two societies, either because the sotties were\r\nmade sometimes to resemble too closely the farces, or because each\r\ntrespassed too often on the territories of the other. Their differences\r\nwere finally arranged by a compromise, whereby the Bazochians yielded\r\nto their rivals the privilege of performing farces, and received in\r\nreturn the permission to perform sotties. The Bazochians, too, had\r\ninvented a new class of dramatic pieces which they called _Moralities_,\r\nand in which allegorical personages were introduced. Thus three\r\ndramatic societies continued to exist in France through the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and until the middle of the sixteenth.\r\n\r\nThese various pieces, under the titles of farces, sotties, moralities,\r\nor whatever other names might be given to them, had become exceedingly\r\npopular at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and a very\r\nconsiderable number of them were printed, and many of them are still\r\npreserved, but they are books of great rarity, and often unique.[90]\r\nOf these the farces form the most numerous class. They consist simply\r\nof the tales of the older jougleurs or story-tellers represented in a\r\ndramatic form, but they often display great skill in conducting the\r\nplot, and a considerable amount of wit. The story of the sheep-stealer\r\nin the Towneley play of \"The Shepherds,\" is a veritable farce. As\r\nin the fabliaux, the most common subjects of these farces are love\r\nintrigues, carried on in a manner which speaks little for the morality\r\nof the age in which they were written. Family quarrels frequently\r\nform the subject of a farce, and the weaknesses and vices of women.\r\nThe priests, as usual, are not spared, but are introduced as the\r\nseducers of wives and daughters. In one the wives have found a means of\r\nre-modelling their husbands and making them young again, which they put\r\nin practice with various ludicrous circumstances. Tricks of servants\r\nare also common subjects for these farces. One is the story of a boy\r\nwho does not know his own father, and some of the subjects are of a\r\nstill more trivial character, as that of the boy who steals a tart from\r\nthe pastrycook's shop. Two hungry boys, prowling about the streets,\r\ncome to the shop door just as the pastrycook is giving directions for\r\nsending an eel-pie after him. By an ingenious deception the boys gain\r\npossession of the pie and eat it, and they are both caught and severely\r\nchastised. This is the whole plot of the farce. A dull schoolboy\r\nexamined by his master in the presence of his parents, and the mirth\r\nproduced by his blunders and their ignorance, formed also a favourite\r\nsubject among these farces. One or two examples are preserved, and,\r\nfrom a companion of them, we might be led to suspect that Shakespeare\r\ntook the idea of the opening scene in the fourth act of the \"Merry\r\nWives of Windsor\" from one of these old farces.\r\n\r\n [90] The most remarkable collection of these early farces, sotties,\r\n      and moralities yet known, was found accidentally in 1845, and\r\n      is now in the British Museum. These were all edited in Paris\r\n      as the first three volumes of a work in ten, entitled \"Ancien\r\n      Théatre François, ou Collection des Ouvrages dramatiques les plus\r\n      remarquable depuis les Mystères jusqu'à Corneille, publié ... par\r\n      M. Viollet le Duc,\" 12mo., Paris, 1854. It is right to state that\r\n      these three volumes were edited, not by M. Viollet le Duc, but\r\n      by a scholar better known for his learning in the older French\r\n      literature, M. Anatole de Montaiglon.\r\n\r\nThe sotties and moralities were more imaginative and extravagant\r\nthan the farces, and were filled with allegorical personages. The\r\ncharacters introduced in the former have generally some relation to\r\nthe kingdom of folly. Thus, in one of the sotties, the king of fools\r\n(_le roy des sotz_) is represented as holding his court, and consulting\r\nwith his courtiers, whose names are Triboulet, Mitouflet, Sottinet,\r\nCoquibus, and Guippelin. Their conversation, as may be supposed, is\r\nof a satirical character. Another is entitled \"The Sottie of the\r\nDeceivers,\" or cheats. Sottie--another name for mother Folly--opens\r\nthe piece with a proclamation or address to fools of all descriptions,\r\nsummoning them to her presence. Two, named Teste-Verte and Fine-Mine,\r\nobey the call, and they are questioned as to their own condition, and\r\ntheir proceedings, but their conversation is interrupted by the sudden\r\nintrusion of another personage named Everyone (_Chascun_), who, on\r\nexamination, is found to be as perfect a fool as any of them. They\r\naccordingly fraternise, and join in a song. Finally, another character,\r\nThe Time (_le Temps_), joins them, and they agree to submit to his\r\ndirections. Accordingly he instructs them in the arts of flattery\r\nand deceiving, and the other similar means by which men of that time\r\nsought to thrive. Another is the Sottie of Foolish Ostentation (_de\r\nfolle bobance_). This lady similarly opens the scene with an address\r\nto all the fools who hold allegiance to her, and three of these make\r\ntheir appearance. The first fool is the gentleman, the second the\r\nmerchant, the fourth the peasant, and their conversation is a satire\r\non contemporary society. The personification of abstract principles is\r\nfar bolder. The three characters who compose one of these moralities\r\nare Everything (_tout_), Nothing (_rien_), and Everyone (_chascun_).\r\nHow the personification of Nothing was to be represented, we are not\r\ntold. The title of another of these moralities will be enough to give\r\nthe reader a notion of their general title; it is, \"A New Morality of\r\nthe Children of Now-a-Days (_Maintenant_), who are the Scholars of\r\nOnce-good (_Jabien_), who shows them how to play at Cards and at Dice,\r\nand to entertain Luxury, whereby one comes to Shame (_Honte_), and\r\nfrom Shame to Despair (_Desespoir_), and from Despair to the gibbet of\r\nPerdition, and then turns himself to Good-doing.\" The characters in\r\nthis play are Now-a-Days, Once-good, Luxury, Shame, Despair, Perdition,\r\nand Good-doing.\r\n\r\nThe three dramatic societies which produced all these farces, sotties,\r\nand moralities, continued to flourish in France until the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century, at which period a great revolution in dramatic\r\nliterature took place in that country. The performance of the Mysteries\r\nhad been forbidden by authority, and the Bazochians themselves were\r\nsuppressed. The petty drama represented by the farces and sotties\r\nwent rapidly out of fashion, in the great change through which the\r\nmind of society was at this time passing, and in which the taste for\r\nclassical literature overcame all others. The old drama in France had\r\ndisappeared, and a new one, formed entirely upon an imitation of the\r\nclassical drama, was beginning to take its place. This incipient drama\r\nwas represented in the sixteenth century by Etienne Jodel, by Jacques\r\nGrevin, by Rémy Belleau, and especially by Pierre de Larivey, the most\r\nprolific, and perhaps the most talented, of the earlier French regular\r\ndramatic authors.\r\n\r\nThese French dramatic essays, the farces, the sotties, and the\r\nmoralities, were imitated, and sometimes translated, in English, and\r\nmany of them were printed; for the further our researches are carried\r\ninto the early history of printing, the more we are astonished at the\r\nextreme activity of the press, even in its infancy, in multiplying\r\nliterature of a popular character. In England, as in France, the\r\nfarces had been, at a rather early period, detached from the mysteries\r\nand miracle-plays, but the word _interludes_ had been adopted here\r\nas the general title for them, and continued in use even after the\r\nestablishment of the regular drama. Perhaps this name owed its\r\npopularity to the circumstance that it seemed more appropriate to its\r\nobject, when it became so fashionable in England to act these plays at\r\nintervals in the great festivals and entertainments given at court, or\r\nin the households of the great nobles. At all events, there can be\r\nno doubt that this fashion had a great influence on the fate of the\r\nEnglish stage. The custom of performing plays in the universities,\r\ngreat schools, and inns of court, had also the effect of producing a\r\nnumber of very clever dramatic writers; for when this literature was\r\nso warmly patronised by princes and nobles, people of the highest\r\nqualifications sought to excel in it. Hence we find from books of\r\nhousehold expenses and similar records of the period, that there was,\r\nduring the sixteenth century, an immense number of such plays compiled\r\nin England which were never printed, and of which, therefore, very few\r\nare preserved.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known plays of this description in the English language\r\nbelong to the class which were called in France moralities. They are\r\nthree in number, and are preserved in a manuscript in the possession\r\nof Mr. Hudson Gurney, which I have not seen, but which is said to be\r\nof the reign of our king Henry VI. Several words and allusions in them\r\nseem to me to show that they were translated, or adapted, from the\r\nFrench. They contain exactly the same kind of allegorical personages.\r\nThe allegory itself is a simple one, and easily understood. In the\r\nfirst, which is entitled the \"Castle of Perseverance,\" the hero is\r\n_Humanum Genus_ (Mankynd), for the names of the parts are all given in\r\nLatin. On the birth of this personage, a good and a bad angel offer\r\nthemselves as his protectors and guides, and he chooses the latter, who\r\nintroduces him to _Mundus_ (the World), and to his friends, _Stultitia_\r\n(Folly), and _Voluptas_ (Pleasure). These and some other personages\r\nbring him under the influence of the seven deadly sins, and _Humanum\r\nGenus_ takes for his bedfellow a lady named _Luxuria_. At length\r\n_Confessio_ and _Pœnitentia_ succeed in reclaiming _Humanum Genus_,\r\nand they conduct him for security to the Castle of Perseverance, where\r\nthe seven cardinal virtues attend upon him. He is besieged in this\r\ncastle by the seven deadly sins, who are led to the attack by Belial,\r\nbut are defeated. _Humanum Genus_ has now become aged, and is exposed\r\nto the attacks of another assailant. This is _Avaritia_, who enters\r\nthe Castle stealthily by undermining the wall, and artfully persuades\r\n_Humanum Genus_ to leave it. He thus comes again under the influence\r\nof _Mundus_, until _Mors_ (Death) arrives, and the bad angel carries\r\noff the victim to the domains of Satan. This, however, is not the end\r\nof the piece. God appears, seated on His throne, and Mercy, Peace,\r\nJustice, and Truth appear before Him, the two former pleading for,\r\nand the latter against, _Humanum Genus_, who, after some discussion,\r\nis saved. This allegorical picture of human life was, in one form or\r\nother, a favourite subject of the moralisers. I may quote as examples\r\nthe interludes of \"Lusty Juventus,\" reprinted in Hawkins's \"Origin\r\nof the English Drama,\" and the \"Disobedient Child,\" and \"Trial of\r\nTreasure,\" reprinted by the Percy Society.\r\n\r\nThe second of the moralities ascribed to the reign of Henry VI., has\r\nfor its principal characters Mind, Will, and Understanding. These are\r\nassailed by Lucifer, who succeeds in alluring them to vice, and they\r\nchange their modest raiment for the dress of gay gallants. Various\r\nother characters are introduced in a similar strain of allegory, until\r\nthey are reclaimed by Wisdom. Mankind is again the principal personage\r\nof the third of these moralities, and some of the other characters in\r\nthe play, such as Nought, New-guise, and Now-a-days, remind us of the\r\nsimilar allegorical personages in the French moralities described above.\r\n\r\nThese interludes bring us into acquaintance with a new comic character.\r\nThe great part which folly acted in the social destinies of mankind,\r\nhad become an acknowledged fact; and as the court and almost every\r\ngreat household had its professed fool, so it seems to have been\r\nconsidered that a play also was incomplete without a fool. But,\r\nas the character of the fool was usually given to one of the most\r\nobjectionable characters in it, so, for this reason apparently, the\r\nfool in a play was called the _Vice_. Thus, in \"Lusty Juventus,\" the\r\ncharacter of Hypocrisy is called the Vice; in the play of \"All for\r\nMoney,\" it is Sin; in that of \"Tom Tyler and his Wife,\" it is Desire;\r\nin the \"Trial of Treasure\" it is Inclination; and in some instances the\r\nVice appears to be the demon himself. The Vice seems always to have\r\nbeen dressed in the usual costume of a court fool, and he perhaps had\r\nother duties besides his mere part in the plot, such as making jests of\r\nhis own, and using other means for provoking the mirth of the audience\r\nin the intervals of the action.\r\n\r\nA few of our early English interludes were, in the strict sense of the\r\nword, farces. Such is the \"mery play\" of \"John the Husband, Tyb the\r\nWife, and Sir John the Priest,\" written by John Heywood, the plot of\r\nwhich presents the same simplicity as those of the farces which were so\r\npopular in France. John has a shrew for his wife, and has good causes\r\nfor suspecting an undue intimacy between her and the priest; but they\r\nfind means to blind his eyes, which is the more easily done, because\r\nhe is a great coward, except when he is alone. Tyb, the wife, makes a\r\npie, and proposes that the priest shall be invited to assist in eating\r\nit. The husband is obliged, very unwillingly, to be the bearer of the\r\ninvitation, and is not a little surprised when the priest refuses it.\r\nHe gives as his reason, that he was unwilling to intrude himself into\r\ncompany where he knew he was disliked, and persuaded John that he had\r\nfallen under the wife's displeasure, because, in private interviews\r\nwith her, he had laboured to induce her to bridle her temper, and treat\r\nher husband with more gentleness. John, delighted at the discovery\r\nof the priest's honesty, insists on his going home with him to feast\r\nupon the pie. There the guilty couple contrive to put the husband to a\r\ndisagreeable penance, while they eat the pie, and treat him otherwise\r\nvery ignominiously, in consequence of which the married couple fight.\r\nThe priest interferes, and the fight thus becomes general, and is only\r\nended by the departure of Tyb and the priest, leaving the husband alone.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the moralities in England is, perhaps, to be\r\nexplained by peculiarities in the condition of society, and the\r\ngreater pre-occupation of men's minds in our country at that time\r\nwith the religious and social revolution which was then in progress.\r\nThe Reformers soon saw the use which might be made of the stage, and\r\ncompiled and caused to be acted interludes in which the old doctrines\r\nand ceremonies were turned to ridicule, and the new ones were held up\r\nin a favourable light. We have excellent examples of the success with\r\nwhich this plan was carried out in the plays of the celebrated John\r\nBale. His play of \"Kyng Johan,\" an edition of which was published by\r\nthe Camden Society, is not only a remarkable work of a very remarkable\r\nman, but it may be considered as the first rude model of the English\r\nhistorical drama. The stage became now a political instrument in\r\nEngland, almost as it had been in ancient Greece, and it thus became\r\nfrequently the object of particular as well as general persecution.\r\nIn 1543, the vicar of Yoxford, in Suffolk, drew upon himself the\r\nviolent hostility of the other clergy in that county by composing and\r\ncausing to be performed plays against the pope's counsellors. Six years\r\nafterwards, in 1549, a royal proclamation prohibited for a time the\r\nperformance of interludes throughout the kingdom, on the ground that\r\nthey contained \"matter tendyng to sedicion and contempnyng of sundery\r\ngood orders and lawes, whereupon are growen daily, and are likely\r\nto growe, muche disquiet, division, tumultes, and uproares in this\r\nrealme.\" From this time forward we begin to meet with laws for the\r\nregulation of stage performances, and proceedings in cases of supposed\r\ninfractions of them, and it became customary to obtain the approval of\r\na play by the privy council before it was allowed to be acted. Thus\r\ngradually arose the office of a dramatic censor.\r\n\r\nWith Bale and with John Heywood, the English plays began to approach\r\nthe form of a regular drama, and the two now rather celebrated pieces,\r\n\"Ralph Roister Doister,\" and \"Gammer Gurton's Needle,\" which belong\r\nto the middle of the sixteenth century, may be considered as comedies\r\nrather than as interludes. The former, written by a well-known scholar\r\nof that time, Nicholas Udall, master of Eton, is a satirical picture\r\nof some phases of London life, and relates the ridiculous adventures\r\nof a weak-headed and vain-glorious gallant, who believes that all\r\nthe women must be in love with him, and who is led by a needy and\r\ndesigning parasite named Matthew Merygreeke. Rude as it is as a\r\ndramatic composition, it displays no lack of talent, and it is full\r\nof genuine humour. The humour in \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\" is none\r\nthe less rich because it is of coarser and rather broader cast. The\r\ngood dame of the piece, Gammer Gurton, during an interruption in the\r\nprocess of mending the breeches of her husband, Hodge, has lost her\r\nneedle, and much lamentation follows a misfortune so great at a time\r\nwhen needles appear to have been rare and valuable articles in the\r\nrural household. In the midst of their trouble appears Diccon, who is\r\ndescribed in the _dramatis personæ_ as \"Diccon the Bedlam,\" meaning\r\nthat he was an idiot, and who appears to hold the position of Vice in\r\nthe play. Diccon, however, though weak-minded, is a cunning fellow, and\r\nespecially given to making mischief, and he accuses a neighbour, Dame\r\nChat, of stealing the needle. At the same time, the same mischievous\r\nindividual tells Dame Chat that Gammer Gurton's cock had been stolen in\r\nthe night from the henroost, and that she, Dame Chat, was accused of\r\nbeing the thief. Amid the general misunderstanding which results from\r\nDiccon's successful endeavours, they send for the parson of the parish,\r\nDr. Rat, who appears to unite in himself the three parts of preacher,\r\nphysician, and conjurer, in order to have advantage of his experience\r\nin finding the needle. Diccon now contrives a new piece of mischief.\r\nHe persuades Dame Chat that Hodge intends to hide himself in a certain\r\nhole in the premises, in order, that night, to creep out and kill all\r\nher hens; and at the same time he informs Dr. Rat, that if he will\r\nhide in the same hole, he will give him ocular demonstration of Dame\r\nChat's guilt of stealing the needle. The consequence is that Dame Chat\r\nattacks by surprise, and somewhat violently, the supposed depredator\r\nin the hole, and that Dr. Rat gets a broken head. Dame Chat is brought\r\nbefore \"Master Bayly\" for the assault, and the proceedings in the trial\r\nbring to light the deceptions which have been played upon them all,\r\nand Diccon stands convicted as the wicked perpetrator. In fact, the\r\n\"bedlam\" confesses it all, and it is finally decided by \"Master Bayly\"\r\nthat there shall be a general reconciliation, and that Diccon shall\r\ntake a solemn oath on Hodge's breech, that he will do his best to find\r\nthe lost needle. Diccon has still the spirit of mischief in him, and\r\ninstead of laying his hand quietly on Hodge's breech, he gives him a\r\nsharp blow, which is responded to by an unexpected scream. The needle,\r\nindeed, which has never quitted the breeches, is driven rather deep\r\ninto the fleshy part of Hodge's body, and the general joy at having\r\nfound it again overruling all other considerations, they all agree to\r\nbe friends over a jug of \"drink.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot but feel astonished at the short period which it required\r\nto develop rude attempts at dramatic composition like this into the\r\nwonderful creations of a Shakespeare; and it can only be explained\r\nby the fact that it was an age remarkable for producing men of\r\nextraordinary genius in every branch of intellectual development.\r\nHitherto, the literature of the stage had represented the intelligence\r\nof the mass; it became individualised in Shakespeare, and this fact\r\nmarks an entirely new era in the history of the drama. In the writings\r\nof our great bard, nearly all the peculiarities of the older national\r\ndrama are preserved, even some which may be perhaps considered as its\r\ndefects, but carried to a degree of perfection which they had never\r\nattained before. The drollery, which, as we have seen, could not be\r\ndispensed with even in the religious mysteries and miracle-plays, had\r\nbecome so necessary, that it could not be dispensed with in tragedy.\r\nIts omission belonged to a later period, when the foreign dramatists\r\nbecame objects of imitation in England. But in the earlier drama, these\r\nscenes of drollery seem frequently to have no connection whatever with\r\nthe general plot, while Shakespeare always interweaves them skilfully\r\nwith it, and they seem to form an integral and necessary part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  DIABLERIE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.--EARLY TYPES OF THE DIABOLICAL\r\n     FORMS.--ST. ANTHONY.--ST. GUTHLAC.--REVIVAL OF THE TASTE FOR SUCH\r\n     SUBJECTS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.--THE FLEMISH\r\n     SCHOOL OF BREUGHEL.--THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN SCHOOLS, CALLOT,\r\n     SALVATOR ROSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the popular demonology furnished materials for the\r\nearliest exercise of comic art in the middle ages, and how the taste\r\nfor this particular class of grotesque lasted until the close of the\r\nmediæval period. After the \"renaissance\" of art and literature, this\r\ntaste took a still more remarkable form, and the school of grotesque\r\n_diablerie_ which flourished during the sixteenth century, and the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth, justly claims a chapter to itself.\r\n\r\nThe birthplace of this demonology, as far as it belongs to\r\nChristianity, must probably be sought in the deserts of Egypt. It\r\nspread thence over the east and the west, and when it reached our\r\npart of the world, it grafted itself, as I have remarked in a former\r\nchapter, on the existing popular superstitions of Teutonic paganism.\r\nThe playfully burlesque, which held so great a place in these\r\nsuperstitions, no doubt gave a more comic character to this Christian\r\ndemonology than it had possessed before the mixture. Its primitive\r\nrepresentative was the Egyptian monk, St. Anthony, who is said to have\r\nbeen born at a village called Coma, in Upper Egypt, in the year 251.\r\nHis history was written in Greek by St. Athanasius, and was translated\r\ninto Latin by the ecclesiastical historian Evagrius. Anthony was\r\nevidently a fanatical visionary, subject to mental illusions, which\r\nwere fostered by his education. To escape from the temptations of the\r\nworld, he sold all his property, which was considerable, gave it to\r\nthe poor, and then retired into the desert of the Thebaid, to live a\r\nlife of the strictest asceticism. The evil one persecuted him in his\r\nsolitude, and sought to drive him back into the corruptions of worldly\r\nlife. He first tried to fill his mind with regretful reminiscences\r\nof his former wealth, position in society, and enjoyments; when this\r\nfailed, he disturbed his mind with voluptuous images and desires, which\r\nthe saint resisted with equal success. The persecutor now changed his\r\ntactics, and presenting himself to Anthony in the form of a black and\r\nugly youth, confessed to him, with apparent candour, that he was the\r\nspirit of uncleanness, and acknowledged that he had been vanquished by\r\nthe extraordinary merits of Anthony's sanctity. The saint, however,\r\nsaw that this was only a stratagem to stir up in him the spirit of\r\npride and self-confidence, and he met it by subjecting himself to\r\ngreater mortifications than ever, which of course made him still more\r\nliable to these delusions. Now he sought greater solitude by taking\r\nup his residence in a ruined Egyptian sepulchre, but the farther he\r\nwithdrew from the world, the more he became the object of diabolical\r\npersecution. Satan broke in upon his privacy with a host of attendants,\r\nand during the night beat him to such a degree, that one morning the\r\nattendant who brought him food found him lying senseless in his cell,\r\nand had him carried to the town, where his friends were on the point of\r\nburying him, believing him to be dead, when he suddenly revived, and\r\ninsisted on being taken back to his solitary dwelling. The legend tells\r\nus that the demons appeared to him in the forms of the most ferocious\r\nanimals, such as lions, bulls, wolves, asps, serpents, scorpions,\r\npanthers, and bears, each attacking him in the manner peculiar to its\r\nspecies, and with its peculiar voice, thus making together a horrible\r\ndin. Anthony left his tomb to retire farther into the desert, where he\r\nmade a ruined castle his residence; and here he was again frightfully\r\npersecuted by the demons, and the noise they made was so great and\r\nhorrible that it was often heard at a vast distance. According to the\r\nnarrative, Anthony reproached the demons in very abusive language,\r\ncalled them hard names, and even spat in their faces; but his most\r\neffective weapon was always the cross. Thus the saint became bolder,\r\nand sought a still more lonely abode, and finally established himself\r\non the top of a high mountain in the upper Thebaid. The demons still\r\ncontinued to persecute him, under a great variety of forms; on one\r\noccasion their chief appeared to him under the form of a man, with the\r\nlower members of an ass.\r\n\r\nThe demons which tormented St. Anthony became the general type for\r\nsubsequent creations, in which these first pictures were gradually, and\r\nin the sequel, greatly improved upon. St. Anthony's persecutors usually\r\nassumed the shapes of _bonâ fide_ animals, but those of later stories\r\ntook monstrous and grotesque forms, strange mixtures of the parts of\r\ndifferent animals, and of others which never existed. Such were seen\r\nby St. Guthlac, the St. Anthony of the Anglo-Saxons, among the wild\r\nmorasses of Croyland. One night, which he was passing at his devotions\r\nin his cell, they poured in upon him in great numbers; \"and they filled\r\nall the house with their coming, and they poured in on every side,\r\nfrom above and from beneath, and everywhere. They were in countenance\r\nhorrible, and they had great heads, and a long neck, and lean visage;\r\nthey were filthy and squalid in their beards, and they had rough ears,\r\nand distorted face, and fierce eyes, and foul mouths; and their teeth\r\nwere like horses' tusks, and their throats were filled with flame, and\r\nthey were grating in their voice; they had crooked shanks, and knees\r\nbig and great behind, and distorted toes, and shrieked hoarsely with\r\ntheir voices; and they came with such immoderate noises and immense\r\nhorror, that it seemed to him that all between heaven and earth\r\nresounded with their dreadful cries.\" On another similar occasion, \"it\r\nhappened one night, when the holy man Guthlac fell to his prayers, he\r\nheard the howling of cattle and various wild beasts. Not long after\r\nhe saw the appearance of animals and wild beasts and creeping things\r\ncoming in to him. First he saw the visage of a lion that threatened him\r\nwith his bloody tusks, also the likeness of a bull, and the visage of\r\na bear, as when they are enraged. Also he perceived the appearance of\r\nvipers, and a hog's grunting, and the howling of wolves, and croaking\r\nof ravens, and the various whistlings of birds, that they might, with\r\ntheir fantastic appearance, divert the mind of the holy man.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the suggestions on which the mediæval sculptors and\r\nilluminators worked with so much effect, as we have seen repeatedly\r\nin the course of our preceding chapters. After the revival of art\r\nin western Europe in the fifteenth century, this class of legends\r\nbecame great favourites with painters and engravers, and soon gave\r\nrise to the peculiar school of _diablerie_ mentioned above. At that\r\ntime the story of the Temptation of St. Anthony attracted particular\r\nattention, and it is the subject of many remarkable prints belonging\r\nto the earlier ages of the art of engraving. It employed the pencils\r\nof such artists as Martin Schongauer, Israel van Mechen, and Lucas\r\nCranach. Of the latter we have two different engravings on the same\r\nsubject--St. Anthony carried into the air by the demons, who are\r\nrepresented in a great variety of grotesque and monstrous forms. The\r\nmost remarkable of the two bears the date of 1506, and was, therefore,\r\none of Cranach's earlier works. But the great representative of this\r\nearlier school of _diablerie_ was Peter Breughel, a Flemish painter\r\nwho flourished in the middle of the sixteenth century. He was born at\r\nBreughel, near Breda, and lived some time at Antwerp, but afterwards\r\nestablished himself at Brussels. So celebrated was he for the love of\r\nthe grotesque displayed in his pictures, that he was known by the name\r\nof Peter the Droll. Breughel's \"Temptation of St. Anthony,\" like one\r\nor two others of his subjects of the same class, was engraved in a\r\nreduced form by J. T. de Bry. Breughel's demons are figures of the most\r\nfantastic description--creations of a wildly grotesque imagination;\r\nthey present incongruous and laughable mixtures of parts of living\r\nthings which have no relation whatever to one another. Our cut No. 155\r\nrepresents a group of these grotesque demons, from a plate by Breughel,\r\nengraved in 1565, and entitled _Divus Jacobus diabolicis præstigiis\r\nante magnum sistitur_ (St. James is arrested before the magician by\r\ndiabolical delusions). The engraving is full of similarly grotesque\r\nfigures. On the right is a spacious chimney, and up it witches, riding\r\non brooms, are making their escape, while in the air are seen other\r\nwitches riding away upon dragons and a goat. A kettle is boiling over\r\nthe fire, around which a group of monkeys are seen sitting and warming\r\nthemselves. Behind these a cat and a toad are holding a very intimate\r\nconversation. In the background stands and boils the great witches'\r\ncaldron. On the right of the picture the _magus_, or magician, is\r\nseated, reading his _grimoire_; with a frame before him supporting the\r\npot containing his magical ingredients. The saint occupies the middle\r\nof the picture, surrounded by the demons represented in our cut and by\r\nmany others; and as he approaches the magician, he is seen raising his\r\nright hand in the attitude of pronouncing a benediction, the apparent\r\nconsequence of which is a frightful explosion of the magician's pot,\r\nwhich strikes the demons with evident consternation. Nothing can be\r\nmore _bizarre_ than the horse's head upon human legs in armour, the\r\nparody upon a crawling spider behind it, the skull (apparently of a\r\nhorse) supported upon naked human legs, the strangely excited animal\r\nbehind the latter, and the figure furnished with pilgrim's hood\r\nand staff, which appears to be mocking the saint. Another print--a\r\ncompanion to the foregoing--represents the still more complete\r\ndiscomfiture of the _magus_. The saint here occupies the right-hand\r\nside of the picture, and is raising his hand higher, with apparently\r\na greater show of authority. The demons have all turned against their\r\nmaster the magician, whom they are beating and hurling headlong from\r\nhis chair. They seem to be proclaiming their joy at his fall by all\r\nsorts of playful attitudes. It is a sort of demon fair. Some of them,\r\nto the left of the picture, are dancing and standing upon their heads\r\non a tight-rope. Near them another is playing some game like that\r\nwhich we now call the thimble-rig. The monkeys are dancing to the\r\ntune of a great drum. A variety of their mountebank tricks are going\r\non in different parts of the scene. Three of these playful actors are\r\nrepresented in our cut No. 156.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 156. Strange Demons._]\r\n\r\nBreughel also executed a series of similarly grotesque engravings,\r\nrepresenting in this same fantastic manner the virtues and vices, such\r\nas Pride (_superbia_), Courage (_fortitudo_), Sloth (_desidia_), &c.\r\nThese bear the date of 1558. They are crowded with figures equally\r\ngrotesque with those just mentioned, but a great part of which it\r\nwould be almost impossible to describe. I give two examples from the\r\nengraving of \"Sloth,\" in the accompanying cut (No. 157).\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 155. St. James and his Persecutors._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 157. Imps of Sloth._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 158. The Folly of Hunting._]\r\n\r\nFrom making up figures from parts of animals, this early school of\r\ngrotesque proceeded to create animated figures out of inanimate\r\nthings, such as machines, implements of various kinds, household\r\nutensils, and other such articles. A German artist, of about the same\r\ntime as Breughel, has left us a singular series of etchings of this\r\ndescription, which are intended as an allegorical satire on the follies\r\nof mankind. The allegory is here of such a singular character, that\r\nwe can only guess at the meaning of these strange groups through four\r\nlines of German verse which are attached to each of them. In this\r\nmanner we learn that the group represented in our cut, No. 158, which\r\nis the second in this series, is intended as a satire upon those who\r\nwaste their time in hunting, which, the verses tell us, they will in\r\nthe sequel lament bitterly; and they are exhorted to cry loud and\r\ncontinually to God, and to let that serve them in the place of hound\r\nand hawk.\r\n\r\n          _Die zeit die du verleurst mit jagen,\r\n            Die wirstu zwar noch schmertzlich klagen;\r\n          Ruff laut zu Gott gar oft und vil,\r\n            Das sey dein hund und federspil._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 159. The Wastefulness of Youth._]\r\n\r\nThe next picture in the series, which is equally difficult to describe,\r\nis aimed against those who fail in attaining virtue or honour through\r\nsluggishness. Others follow, but I will only give one more example. It\r\nforms our cut No. 159, and appears, from the verses accompanying it,\r\nto be aimed against those who practice wastefulness in their youth,\r\nand thus become objects of pity and scorn in old age. Whatever may be\r\nthe point of the allegory contained in the engraving, it is certainly\r\nfar-fetched, and not very apparent.\r\n\r\nThis German-Flemish school of grotesque does not appear to have\r\noutlived the sixteenth century, or at least it had ceased to flourish\r\nin the century following. But the taste for the _diablerie_ of the\r\nTemptation scenes passed into France and Italy, in which countries\r\nit assumed a much more refined character, though at the same time\r\none equally grotesque and imaginative. These artists, too, returned\r\nto the original legend, and gave it forms of their own conception.\r\nDaniel Rabel, a French artist, who lived at the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, published a rather remarkable engraving of the \"Temptation of\r\nSt. Anthony,\" in which the saint appears on the right of the picture,\r\nkneeling before a mound on which three demons are dancing. On the\r\nright hand of the saint stands a naked woman, sheltering herself with\r\na parasol, and tempting the saint with her charms. The rest of the\r\npiece is filled with demons in a great variety of forms and postures.\r\nAnother French artist, Nicholas Cochin, has left us two \"Temptations of\r\nSt. Anthony,\" in rather spirited etching, of the earlier part of the\r\nseventeenth century. In the first, the saint is represented kneeling\r\nbefore a crucifix, surrounded by demons. The youthful and charming\r\ntemptress is here dressed in the richest garments, and the highest\r\nstyle of fashion, and displays all her powers of seduction. The body of\r\nthe picture is, as usual, occupied by multitudes of diabolical figures,\r\nin grotesque forms. In Cochin's other picture of the Temptation of St.\r\nAnthony, the saint is represented as a hermit engaged in his prayers;\r\nthe female figure of voluptuousness (_voluptas_) occupies the middle of\r\nthe picture, and behind the saint is seen a witch with her besom.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 160. The Demon Tilter (Callot)._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 161. Uneasy Riding (Callot)._]\r\n\r\nBut the artist who excelled in this subject at the period at which we\r\nnow arrive, was the celebrated Jacques Callot, who was born at Nancy,\r\nin Brittany, in 1593, and died at Florence on the 24th of March, 1635,\r\nwhich, according to the old style of calculating, may mean March,\r\n1636. Of Callot we shall have to speak in another chapter. He treated\r\nthe subject of the Temptation of St. Anthony in two different plates,\r\nwhich are considered as ranking among the most remarkable of his\r\nworks, and to which, in fact, he appears to have given much thought\r\nand attention. He is known, indeed, to have worked diligently at it.\r\nThey resemble those of the older artists in the number of diabolical\r\nfigures introduced into the picture, but they display an extraordinary\r\nvivid imagination in the forms, postures, physiognomies, and even\r\nthe equipments, of the chimerical figures, all equally droll and\r\nburlesque, but which present an entire contrast to the more coarse and\r\nvulgar conceptions of the German-Flemish school. This difference will\r\nbe understood best by an example. One of Callot's demons is represented\r\nin our cut No. 160. Many of them are mounted on nondescript animals,\r\nof the most extraordinary demoniacal character, and such is the case\r\nof the demon in our cut, who is running a tilt at the saint with his\r\ntilting spear in his hand, and, to make more sure, his eyes well\r\nfurnished with a pair of spectacles. In our next cut, No. 161, we give\r\na second example of the figures in Callot's peculiar _diablerie_.\r\nThe demon in this case is riding very uneasily, and, in fact, seems\r\nin danger of being thrown. The steeds of both are of an anomalous\r\ncharacter; the first is a sort of dragon-horse; the second a mixture\r\nof a lobster, a spider, and a craw-fish. Mariette, the art-collector\r\nand art-writer of the reign of Louis XV. as well as artist, considers\r\nthis grotesque, or, as he calls it, \"fantastic and comic character,\"\r\nas almost necessary to the pictures of the Temptation of St. Anthony,\r\nwhich he treats as one of Callot's especially _serious_ subjects.\r\n\"It was allowable,\" he says, \"to Callot, to give a flight to his\r\nimagination. The more his fictions were of the nature of dreams,\r\nthe more they were fitted to what he had to express. For the demon\r\nintending to torment St. Anthony, it is to be supposed that he must\r\nhave thought of all the forms most hideous, and most likely to strike\r\nterror.\"\r\n\r\nCallot's first and larger print of the Temptation of St. Anthony is\r\nrare. It is filled with a vast number of figures. Above is a fantastic\r\nbeing who vomits thousands of demons. The saint is seen at the entrance\r\nof a cavern, tormented by some of these. Others are scattered about in\r\ndifferent occupations. On one side, a demoniacal party are drinking\r\ntogether, and pledging each other in their glasses; here, a devil is\r\nplaying on the guitar; there, others are occupied in a dance; all\r\nsuch grotesque figures as our two examples would lead the reader to\r\nexpect. In the second of Callot's \"Temptations,\" which is dated in\r\n1635, and must therefore have been one of his latest works, the same\r\nfigure vomiting the demons occupies the upper part of the plate, and\r\nthe field is covered with a prodigious number of imps, more hideous in\r\ntheir forms, and more varied in their extraordinary attitudes, than in\r\nthe same artist's first design. Below, a host of demons are dragging\r\nthe saint to a place where new torments are prepared for him. Callot's\r\nprints of the Temptation of St. Anthony gained so great a reputation,\r\nthat imitations of them were subsequently published, some of which so\r\nfar approached his style, that they were long supposed to be genuine.\r\n\r\nCallot, though a Frenchman, studied and flourished in Italy, and\r\nhis style is founded upon Italian art. The last great artist whose\r\ntreatment of the Temptation I shall quote, is Salvator Rosa, an Italian\r\nby birth, who flourished in the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\nHis style, according to some opinions, is refined from that of Callot;\r\nat all events, it is bolder in design. Our cut No. 162 represents St.\r\nAnthony protecting himself with the cross against the assaults of the\r\ndemon, as represented by Salvator Rosa. With this artist the school of\r\n_diablerie_ of the sixteenth century may be considered to have come to\r\nits end.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 162. St. Anthony and his Persecutor._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  CALLOT AND HIS SCHOOL.--CALLOT'S ROMANTIC HISTORY.--HIS\r\n     \"CAPRICI,\" AND OTHER BURLESQUE WORKS.--THE \"BALLI\" AND THE\r\n     BEGGARS.--IMITATORS OF CALLOT; DELLA BELLA.--EXAMPLES OF DELLA\r\n     BELLA.--ROMAIN DE HOOGHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of engraving on copper, although it had made rapid advances\r\nduring the sixteenth century, was still very far from perfection; but\r\nthe close of that century witnessed the birth of a man who was destined\r\nnot only to give a new character to this art, but also to bring in a\r\nnew style of caricature and burlesque. This was the celebrated Jacques\r\nCallot, a native of Lorraine, and descended from a noble Burgundian\r\nfamily. His father, Jean Callot, held the office of herald of Lorraine.\r\nJacques was born in the year 1592,[91] at Nancy, and appears to have\r\nbeen destined for the church, with a view to which his early education\r\nwas regulated. But the early life of Jacques Callot presents a\r\nromantic episode in the history of art aspirations. While yet hardly\r\nmore than an infant, he seized every opportunity of neglecting more\r\nserious studies to practise drawing, and he displayed especially a\r\nvery precocious taste for satire, for his artistic talent was shown\r\nprincipally in caricaturing all the people he knew. His father, and\r\napparently all his relatives, disapproved of his love for drawing, and\r\ndid what they could to discourage it; but in vain, for he still found\r\nmeans of indulging it. Claude Henriet, the painter to the court of\r\nLorraine, gave him lessons, and his son, Israel Henriet, formed for\r\nhim a boy's friendship. He also learnt the elements of the art of\r\nengraving of Demange Crocq, the engraver to the duke of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n [91] This is the date fixed by Meaume, in his excellent work on\r\n      Callot, entitled \"Recherches sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de\r\n      Jacques Callot,\" 2 tom. 8vo., 1860.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the painter Bellange, who had been a pupil of Claude\r\nHenriet, returned from Italy, and gave young Callot an exciting account\r\nof the wonders of art to be seen in that country; and soon afterwards\r\nClaude Henriet dying, his son Israel went to Rome, and his letters\r\nfrom thence had no less effect on the mind of the young artist at\r\nNancy, than the conversation of Bellange. Indeed the passion of the boy\r\nfor art was so strong, that, finding his parents obstinately opposed\r\nto all his longings in this direction, he left his father's house\r\nsecretly, and, in the spring of 1604, when he had only just entered his\r\nthirteenth year, he set out for Italy on foot, without introductions\r\nand almost without money. He was even unacquainted with the road, but\r\nafter proceeding a short distance, he fell in with a band of gipsies,\r\nand, as they were going to Florence, he joined their company. His\r\nlife among the gipsies, which lasted seven or eight weeks, appears to\r\nhave furnished food to his love of burlesque and caricature, and he\r\nhas handed down to us his impressions, in a series of four engravings\r\nof scenes in gipsy life, admirably executed at a rather later period\r\nof his life, which are full of comic humour. When they arrived at\r\nFlorence, Jacques Callot parted company with the gipsies, and was\r\nfortunate enough to meet with an officer of the grand duke's household,\r\nwho listened to his story, and took so much interest in him, that he\r\nobtained him admission to the studio of Remigio Canta Gallina. This\r\nartist gave him instructions in drawing and engraving, and sought to\r\ncorrect him of his taste for the grotesque by keeping him employed upon\r\nserious subjects.\r\n\r\nAfter studying for some months under Canta Gallina, Jacques Callot\r\nleft Florence, and proceeded to Rome, to seek his old friend Israel\r\nHenriet; but he had hardly arrived, when he was recognised in the\r\nstreets by some merchants from Nancy, who took him, and in spite of\r\nhis tears and resistance, carried him home to his parents. He was\r\nnow kept to his studies more strictly than ever, but nothing could\r\novercome his passion for art, and, having contrived to lay by some\r\nmoney, after a short interval he again ran away from home. This time\r\nhe took the road to Lyons, and crossed Mont Cenis, and he had reached\r\nTurin when he met in the street of that city his elder brother Jean,\r\nwho again carried him home to Nancy. Nothing could now repress young\r\nCallot's ardour, and soon after this second escapade, he engraved a\r\ncopy of a portrait of Charles III., duke of Lorraine, to which he put\r\nhis name and the date 1607, and which, though it displays little skill\r\nin engraving, excited considerable interest at the time. His parents\r\nwere now persuaded that it was useless to thwart any longer his natural\r\ninclinations, and they not only allowed him to follow them, but they\r\nyielded to his wish to return to Italy. The circumstances of the moment\r\nwere especially favourable. Charles III., duke of Lorraine, was dead,\r\nand his successor, Henry II., was preparing to send an embassy to Rome\r\nto announce his accession. Jean Callot, by his position of herald,\r\nhad sufficient interest to obtain for his son an appointment in the\r\nambassador's retinue, and Jacques Callot started for Rome on the 1st\r\nof December, 1608, under more favourable auspices than those which had\r\nattended his former visits to Italy.\r\n\r\nCallot reached Rome at the beginning of the year 1609, and now at\r\nlength he joined the friend of his childhood, Israel Henriet, and began\r\nto throw all his energy into his art-labours. It is more than probable\r\nthat he studied under Tempesta, with Henriet, who was a pupil of that\r\npainter, and another Lorrainer, Claude Dervet. After a time, Callot\r\nbegan to feel the want of money, and obtained employment of a French\r\nengraver, then residing in Rome, named Philippe Thomassin, with whom he\r\nworked nearly three years, and became perfect in handling the graver.\r\nTowards the end of the year 1611, Callot went to Florence, to place\r\nhimself under Julio Parigi, who then flourished there as a painter and\r\nengraver. Tuscany was at this time ruled by its duke Cosmo de' Medicis,\r\na great lover of the arts, who took Callot under his patronage, giving\r\nhim the means to advance himself. Hitherto his occupation had been\r\nprincipally copying the works of others, but under Parigi he began to\r\npractise more in original design, and his taste for the grotesque came\r\nupon him stronger than ever. Although Parigi blamed it, he could not\r\nhelp admiring the talent it betrayed. In 1615, the grand duke gave a\r\ngreat entertainment to the prince of Urbino, and Callot was employed\r\nto make engravings of the festivities; it was his first commencement\r\nin a class of designs by which he afterwards attained great celebrity.\r\nIn the year following, his engagement with Parigi ended, and he became\r\nhis own master. He now came out unfettered in his own originality. The\r\nfirst fruits were seen in a new kind of designs, to which he gave the\r\nname of \"Caprices,\" a series of which appeared about the year 1617,\r\nunder the title of \"Caprici di varie Figure.\" Callot re-engraved them\r\nat Nancy in later years, and in the new title they were stated to have\r\nbeen originally engraved in 1616. In a short preface, he speaks of\r\nthese as the first of his works on which he set any value. They now\r\nstrike us as singular examples of the fanciful creations of a most\r\ngrotesque imagination, but they no doubt preserve many traits of the\r\nfestivals, ceremonies, and manners of that land of masquerade, which\r\nmust have been then familiar to the Florentines; and these engravings\r\nwould, doubtless, be received by them with absolute delight. One is\r\ncopied in our cut No. 163; it represents a cripple supporting himself\r\non a short crutch, with his right arm in a sling. Our cut No. 164 is\r\nanother example from the same set, and represents a masked clown, with\r\nhis left hand on the hilt of his dagger, or perhaps of a wooden sword.\r\nFrom this time, although he was very industrious and produced much,\r\nCallot engraved only his own designs.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 163. A Cripple._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 164. A Grotesque Masker._]\r\n\r\nWhile employed for others, Callot had worked chiefly with the graver,\r\nbut now that he was his own master, he laid aside that implement, and\r\ndevoted himself almost entirely to etching, in which he attained the\r\nhighest proficiency. His work is remarkable for the cleanness and ease\r\nof his lines, and for the life and spirit he gave to his figures.\r\nHis talent lay especially in the extraordinary skill with which he\r\ngrouped together great numbers of diminutive figures, each of which\r\npreserved its proper and full action and effect. The great annual fair\r\nof the Impruneta was held with extraordinary festivities, and attended\r\nby an immense concourse of people of all classes on St. Luke's Day,\r\nthe 18th of October, in the outskirts of Florence. Callot engraved\r\na large picture of this fair, which is absolutely wonderful. The\r\npicture embraces an extensive space of ground, which is covered with\r\nhundreds of figures, all occupied, singly or in groups, in different\r\nmanners, conversing, masquerading, buying and selling, playing games,\r\nand performing in various ways; each group or figure is a picture in\r\nitself. This engraving produced quite a sensation, and it was followed\r\nby other pictures of fairs, and, after his final return to Nancy,\r\nCallot engraved it anew. It was this talent for grouping large masses\r\nof persons which caused the artist to be so often employed in drawing\r\ngreat public ceremonies, sieges, and other warlike operations.\r\n\r\nBy the duke of Florence, Cosmo II., Callot was liberally patronised\r\nand loaded with benefits, but on his death the government had to be\r\nplaced in the hands of a regency, and art and literature no longer met\r\nwith the same encouragement. In this state of things, Callot was found\r\nby Charles of Lorraine, afterwards duke Charles IV., and persuaded to\r\nreturn to his native country. He arrived at Nancy in 1622, and began to\r\nwork there with greater activity even than he had displayed before. It\r\nwas not long after this that he produced his sets of grotesques, the\r\nBalli (or dancers), the Gobbi (or hunchbacks), and the Beggars. The\r\nfirst of these sets, called in the title _Balli_, or _Cucurucu_,[92]\r\nconsists of twenty-four small plates, each of them containing two comic\r\ncharacters in grotesque attitudes, with groups of smaller figures in\r\nthe distance. Beneath the two prominent figures are their names, now\r\nunintelligible, but at that time no doubt well known on the comic stage\r\nat Florence. Thus, in the couple given in our cut No. 165, which is\r\ntaken from the fourth plate of the series, the personage to the left\r\nis named Smaraolo Cornuto, which means simply Smaraolo the cuckold;\r\nand the one on the right is called Ratsa di Boio. In the original the\r\nbackground is occupied by a street, full of spectators, looking on at\r\na dance of pantaloons, round one who is mounted on stilts and playing\r\non the tabour. The couple in our cut No. 166, represents another of\r\nCallot's \"Caprices,\" from a set differing from the first \"Caprices,\"\r\nor the Balli. The Gobbi, or hunchbacks, form a set of twenty-one\r\nengravings; and the set of the Gipsies, already alluded to, which was\r\nalso executed at Nancy, was included in four plates, the subjects of\r\nwhich were severally--1, the gipsies travelling; 2, the avant-guard;\r\n3, the halt; and 4, the preparations for the feast. Nothing could be\r\nmore truthful, and at the same time more comic, than this last set of\r\nsubjects. We give, as an example of the set of the Baroni, or beggars,\r\nCallot's figure of one of that particular class--for beggars and rogues\r\nof all kinds were classified in those days--whose part it was to\r\nappeal to charity by wounds and sores artificially represented. In the\r\nEnglish slang of the seventeenth century, these artificial sores were\r\ncalled _clymes_, and a curious account of the manner in which they were\r\nmade will be found in that singular picture of the vicious classes of\r\nsociety in this country at that period, the \"English Rogue,\" by Head\r\nand Kirkman. The false cripple in our cut is holding up his leg to make\r\na display of his pretended infirmity.\r\n\r\n [92] Meaume appears to be doubtful of the meaning of this word; a\r\n      friend has pointed out to me the correction. It was the title\r\n      of a song, so called because the burden was an imitation of the\r\n      crowing of a cock, the singer mimicking also the action of the\r\n      bird. When Bacchus, in Redi's \"Bacco in Toscana,\" is beginning\r\n      to feel the exhilarating effects of his critical investigation\r\n      of the Tuscan wines, he calls upon Ariadne to sing to him \"sulla\r\n      mandola la Cucurucù,\" \"on the mandola the Cucurucu.\" A note\r\n      fully explains the word as we have stated it--\"Canzone cosi\r\n      detta, perchè in esse si replica molte volte la voce del gallo; e\r\n      cantandola si fanno atti e moti simili a quegli di esso gallo.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 165. Smaraolo Cornuto.--Ratsa di Boio._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 166. A Caprice._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 167. The False Cripple._]\r\n\r\nCallot remained at Nancy, with merely temporary absences, during the\r\nremainder of his life. In 1628, he was employed at Brussels in drawing\r\nand engraving the \"Siege of Breda,\" one of the most finished of his\r\nworks, and he there made the personal acquaintance of Vandyck. Early\r\nin 1629, he was called to Paris to execute engravings of the siege of\r\nLa Rochelle, and of the defence of the Isle of Rhé, but he returned to\r\nNancy in 1630. Three years afterwards his native country was invaded\r\nby the armies of Louis XIII., and Nancy surrendered to the French on\r\nthe 25th of September, 1633. Callot was required to make engravings\r\nto celebrate the fall of his native town; but, although he is said\r\nto have been threatened with violence, he refused; and afterwards he\r\ncommemorated the evils brought upon his country by the French invasion\r\nin those two immortal sets of prints, the lesser and greater \"Misères\r\nde la Guerre.\" About two years after this, Callot died, in the prime of\r\nlife, on the 24th of March, 1635.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Callot was great among his contemporaries, and his name\r\nis justly respected as one of the most illustrious in the history of\r\nFrench art. He had, as might be expected, many imitators, and the\r\nCaprices, the Balli, and the Gobbi, became very favourite subjects.\r\nAmong these imitators, the most successful and the most distinguished\r\nwas Stephano Della Bella; and, indeed, the only one deserving of\r\nparticular notice. Della Bella was born at Florence, on the 18th of\r\nMay, 1610;[93] his father, dying two years afterwards, left him an\r\norphan, and his mother in great poverty. As he grew up, he showed, like\r\nCallot himself, precocious talents in art, and of the same kind. He\r\neagerly attended all public festivals, games, &c., and on his return\r\nfrom them made them the subject of grotesque sketches. It was remarked\r\nof him, especially, that he had a curious habit of always beginning\r\nto draw a human figure from the feet, and proceeding upwards to the\r\nhead. He was struck at a very early period of his pursuit of art by the\r\nstyle of Callot, of which, at first, he was a servile imitator, but he\r\nafterwards abandoned some of its peculiarities, and adopted a style\r\nwhich was more his own, though still founded upon that of Callot. He\r\nalmost rivalled Callot in his success in grouping multitudes of figures\r\ntogether, and hence he also was much employed in producing engravings\r\nof sieges, festive entertainments, and such elaborate subjects. As\r\nCallot's aspirations had been directed towards Italy, those of Della\r\nBella were turned towards France, and when in the latter days of\r\nthe ministry of Cardinal Richelieu, the grand duke of Florence sent\r\nAlexandro del Nero as his resident ambassador in Paris, Della Bella\r\nwas permitted to accompany him. Richelieu was occupied in the siege\r\nof Arras, and the engraving of that event was the foundation of Della\r\nBella's fame in France, where he remained about ten years, frequently\r\nemployed on similar subjects. He subsequently visited Flanders and\r\nHolland, and at Amsterdam made the acquaintance of Rembrandt. He\r\nreturned to Florence in 1650, and died there on the 23rd of July, 1664.\r\n\r\n [93] The materials for the history of Della Bella and his works,\r\n      will be found in a carefully compiled volume, by C. A. Jombert,\r\n      entitled, \"Essai d'un Catalogue de l'Oeuvre d'Etienne de la\r\n      Bella.\" 8vo., Paris, 1772.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 168. A Witch Mounted._]\r\n\r\nWhile still in Florence, Della Bella executed four prints of dwarfs\r\nquite in the grotesque style of Callot. In 1637, on the occasion of\r\nthe marriage of the grand duke Ferdinand II., Della Bella published\r\nengravings of the different scenes represented, or performed, on that\r\noccasion. These were effected by very elaborate machinery, and were\r\nrepresented in six engravings, the fifth of which (_scena quinta_)\r\nrepresents hell (_d' Inferno_), and is filled with furies, demons, and\r\nwitches, which might have found a place in Callot's \"Temptation of St.\r\nAnthony.\"\r\n\r\nA specimen of these is given in our cut No. 168--a naked witch seated\r\nupon a skeleton of an animal that might have been borrowed from some\r\nfar distant geological period. In 1642, Della Bella executed a set of\r\nsmall \"Caprices,\" consisting of thirteen plates, from the eighth of\r\nwhich we take our cut No. 169. It represents a beggar-woman, carrying\r\none child on her back, while another is stretched on the ground. In\r\nthis class of subjects Della Bella imitated Callot, but the copyist\r\nnever succeeded in equalling the original. His best style, as an\r\noriginal artist of burlesque and caricature, is shown in a set of five\r\nplates of Death carrying away people of different ages, which he\r\nexecuted in 1648. The fourth of this set is copied in our cut No. 170,\r\nand represents Death carrying off, on his shoulder, a young woman, in\r\nspite of her struggles to escape from him.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 169. Beggary._]\r\n\r\nWith the close of the seventeenth century these \"Caprices\" and\r\nmasquerade scenes began to be no longer in vogue, and caricature and\r\nburlesque assumed new forms; but Callot and Della Bella had many\r\nfollowers, and their examples had a lasting influence upon art.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that a celebrated artist, in another country, at the\r\nend of the same century, the well-known Romain de Hooghe, was produced\r\nfrom the school of Callot, in which he had learnt, not the arts of\r\nburlesque and caricature, but that of skilfully grouping multitudes of\r\nfigures, especially in subjects representing episodes of war, tumults,\r\nmassacres, and public processions.\r\n\r\nOf Romain de Hooghe we shall have to speak again in a subsequent\r\nchapter. In his time the art of engraving had made great advance\r\non the Continent, and especially in France, where it met with more\r\nencouragement than elsewhere. In England this art had, on the whole,\r\nmade much less progress, and was in rather a low condition, one branch\r\nonly excepted, that of portraits. Of the two distinguished engravers\r\nin England during the seventeenth century, Hollar was a Bohemian, and\r\nFaithorne, though an Englishman, learnt his art in France. We only\r\nbegan to have an English school when Dutch and French engravers came in\r\nwith King William to lay the groundwork.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 170.

Society was breaking up, and going through a course of\r\ndecomposition, and it presented to the view on every side spectacles\r\nwhich provoked the mockery, perhaps more than the indignation, of\r\nlookers-on. Even the clergy had learnt to laugh at themselves, and\r\nalmost at their own religion; and people who thought or reflected were\r\ngradually separating into two classes--those who cast all religion\r\nfrom them, and rushed into a jeering scepticism, and those who entered\r\nseriously and with resolution into the work of reformation. The\r\nlatter found most encouragement among the Teutonic nations, while the\r\nsceptical element appears to have had its birth in Italy, and even in\r\nRome itself, where, among popes and cardinals, religion had degenerated\r\ninto empty forms.\r\n\r\nAt some period towards the close of the fifteenth century, a mutilated\r\nancient statue was accidentally dug up in Rome, and it was erected\r\non a pedestal in a place not far from the Ursini Palace. Opposite\r\nit stood the shop of a shoemaker, named Pasquillo, or Pasquino, the\r\nlatter being the form most commonly adopted at a later period. This\r\nPasquillo was notorious as a facetious fellow, and his shop was usually\r\ncrowded by people who went there to tell tales and hear news; and, as\r\nno other name had been invented for the statue, people agreed to give\r\nit the name of the shoemaker, and they called it Pasquillo. It became\r\na custom, at certain seasons, to write on pieces of paper satirical\r\nepigrams, sonnets, and other short compositions in Latin or Italian,\r\nmostly of a personal character, in which the writer declared whatever\r\nhe had seen or heard to the discredit of somebody, and these were\r\npublished by depositing them with the statue, whence they were taken\r\nand read. One of the Latin epigrams which pleads against committing\r\nthese short personal satires to print, calls the time at which it was\r\nusual to compose them Pasquil's festival:--\r\n\r\n          Jam redit illa dies in qua Romana juventus\r\n              Pasquilli festum concelebrabit ovans.\r\n          Sed versus impressos obsecro ut edere omittas,\r\n              Ne noceant iterum quæ nocuere semel.\r\n\r\nThe festival was evidently a favourite one, and well celebrated. \"The\r\nsoldiers of Xerxes,\" says another epigram, placed in Pasquil's mouth,\r\n\"were not so plentiful as the paper bestowed upon me; I shall soon\r\nbecome a bookseller\"--\r\n\r\n          Armigerûm Xerxi non copia tanta papyri\r\n              Quanta mihi: fiam bibliopola statim.\r\n\r\nThe name of Pasquil was soon given to the papers which were deposited\r\nwith the statue, and eventually a _pasquil_, or _pasquin_, was only\r\nanother name for a lampoon or libel. Not far from this statue stood\r\nanother, which was found in the forum of Mars (_Martis forum_), and was\r\nthence popularly called Marforio. Some of these satirical writings were\r\ncomposed in the form of dialogues between Pasquil and Marforio, or of\r\nmessages from one to the other.\r\n\r\nA collection of these pasquils was published in 1544 in two small\r\nvolumes.[94] Many of them are extremely clever, and they are sharply\r\npointed. The popes are frequent objects of bitterest satire. Thus we\r\nare reminded in two lines upon pope Alexander VI. (_sextus_), the\r\ninfamous Borgia, that Tarquin had been a Sextus, and Nero also, and now\r\nanother Sextus was at the head of the Romans, and told that Rome was\r\nalways ruined under a Sextus--\r\n\r\n                         De Alexandro VI. Pont.\r\n            _Sextus Tarquinius, Sextus Nero, Sextus et iste:\r\n                 Semper sub Sextis perdita Roma fuit._\r\n\r\nThe following is given for an epitaph on Lucretia Borgia, pope\r\nAlexander's profligate daughter:--\r\n\r\n            _Hoc tumulo dormit Lucretia nomine, sed re\r\n                Thais, Alexandri filia, sponsa, nurus._\r\n\r\n[94] \"Pasquillorum Tomi duo.\" Eleutheropoli, MDXLIIII.\r\n\r\nIn another of a rather later date, Rome, addressing herself to Pasquil,\r\nis made to complain of two successive popes, Clement VII. (Julio de\r\nMedicis, 1523-1534) and Paul III. (Alexandro Farnese, 1534-1549), and\r\nalso of Leo X. (1513-1521). \"I am,\" Rome says, \"sick enough with the\r\nphysician (_Medicus_, as a pun on the Medicis), I was also the prey of\r\nthe lion (_Leo_), now, Paul, you tear my vitals like a wolf. You, Paul,\r\nare not a god to me, as I thought in my folly, but you are a wolf,\r\nsince you tear the food from my mouth\"--\r\n\r\n          _Sum Medico satis ægra, fui quoque præda Leonis,\r\n              Nunc mea dilaceras viscera, Paule, lupus.\r\n          Non es, Paule, mihi numen, ceu stulta putabam,\r\n              Sed lupus es, quoniam subtrahis ore cibum._\r\n\r\nAnother epigram, addressed to Rome herself, involves a pun in Greek\r\n(in the words _Paulos_, Paul, and _Phaulos_, wicked). \"Once, Rome,\" it\r\nsays, \"lords of lords were thy subjects, now thou in thy wretchedness\r\nart subject to the serfs of serfs; once you listened to the oracles of\r\nSt. Paul, but now you perform the abominable commands of the wicked\"--\r\n\r\n          _Quondam, Roma, tibi suberant domini dominorum,\r\n                Servorum servis nunc miseranda subes;\r\n          Audisti quondam divini oracula Παύλου,\r\n                At nunc των φαύλων jussa nefanda facis._\r\n\r\nThe idea, of course, is the contrast of Rome in her Pagan glory, with\r\nRome in her Christian debasement, very much the same as that which\r\nstruck Gibbon, and gave birth to his great history of Rome's \"decline\r\nand fall.\"[95]\r\n\r\n [95] Pasquil and Pasquin became, during the latter part of the\r\n      sixteenth and the whole of the seventeenth centuries, a\r\n      well-known name in French and English literature. In English\r\n      popular literature he was turned into a jester, and a book was\r\n      published in 1604 under the title \"Pasquil's Jests; with the\r\n      Merriments of Mother Bunch. Wittie, pleasant, and delightfull.\"\r\n\r\nThe pasquils formed a body of satire which struck indiscriminately at\r\neverybody within its range, but satirists were now rising who took for\r\ntheir subjects special cases of the general disorder. Rotten at the\r\nheart, society presented an external glossiness, a mixture of pedantry\r\nand affectation, which offered subjects enough for ridicule in whatever\r\npoint of view it was taken. The ecclesiastical body was in a state of\r\nfermentation, out of which new feelings and new doctrines were about to\r\nrise. The old learning and literature of the middle ages remained in\r\nform after their spirit had passed away, and they were now contending\r\nclumsily and unsuccessfully against new learning and literature of a\r\nmore refined and healthier character. Feudalism itself had fallen, or\r\nit was struggling vainly against new political principles, yet the\r\naristocracy clung to feudal forms and feudal assumptions, with an\r\nexaggeration which was meant for an appearance of strength. Among the\r\nliterary affectations of this false feudalism, was the fashion for\r\nreading the long, dry, old romances of chivalry; while the churchmen\r\nand schoolmen were corrupting the language in which mediæval learning\r\nhad been expressed, into a form the most barbarous, or introducing\r\nwords compounded from the later into the vernacular tongue. These\r\npeculiarities were among the first to provoke literary satire. Italy,\r\nwhere this class of satire originated, gave it its name also, though it\r\nappears still to be a matter of doubt why it was called _macaronic_,\r\nor in its Italian form _maccharonea_. Some have considered this name\r\nto have been taken from the article of food called _macaroni_, to\r\nwhich the Italians were, and still are, so much attached; while others\r\npretend that it was derived from an old Italian word _macarone_, which\r\nmeant a lubberly fellow. Be this, however, as it may, what is called\r\nmacaronic composition, which consists in giving a Latin form to words\r\ntaken from the vulgar tongue, and mixing them with words which are\r\npurely Latin, was introduced in Italy at the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFour Italian writers in macaronic verse are known to have lived before\r\nthe year 1500.[96] The first of these was named Fossa, and he tells\r\nus that he composed his poem entitled \"Vigonce,\" on the second day\r\nof May, 1494. It was printed in 1502. Bassano, a native of Mantua,\r\nand the author of a macaronic which bears no title, was dead in 1499;\r\nand another, a Paduan named Fifi degli Odassi, was born about the\r\nyear 1450. Giovan Georgio Allione, of Asti, who is believed also to\r\nhave written during the last ten years of the fifteenth century,\r\nis a name better known through the edition of his French works,\r\npublished by Monsieur J. C. Brunet in 1836. All these present the\r\nsame coarseness and vulgarity of sentiment, and the same licence in\r\nlanguage and description, which appear to have been taken as necessary\r\ncharacteristics of macaronic composition. Odassi appears to give\r\nsupport to the derivation of the name from macaroni, by making the\r\nprincipal character of his poem a fabricator of that article in Padua--\r\n\r\n          _Est unus in Padua natus speciale cusinus,\r\n          In maccharonea princeps bonus atque magister._\r\n\r\n [96] The great authority on the history of Macaronic literature is my\r\n      excellent friend Monsieur Octave Delepierre, and I will simply\r\n      refer the reader to his two valuable publications, \"Macaronéana,\r\n      ou Mélanges de Littérature Macaronique des differents Peuples de\r\n      l'Europe,\" 8vo., Paris, 1852; and \"Macaronéana,\" 4to., 1863; the\r\n      latter printed for the Philobiblon Club.\r\n\r\nBut the great matter of macaronic poetry was Teofilo Folengo, of whose\r\nlife we know just sufficient to give us a notion of the personal\r\ncharacter of these old literary caricaturists. Folengo was descended\r\nfrom a noble family, which had its seat at the village of Cipada, near\r\nMantua, where he was born on the 8th of November, 1491, and baptised by\r\nthe name of Girolamo. He pursued his studies, first in the university\r\nof Ferrara, under the professor Visago Cocaio, and afterwards in that\r\nof Bologna, under Pietro Pomponiazzo; or rather, he ought to have\r\npursued them, for his love of poetry, and his gaiety of character, led\r\nhim to neglect them, and at length his irregularities became so great,\r\nthat he was obliged to make a hasty flight from Bologna. He was ill\r\nreceived at home, and he left it also, and appears to have subsequently\r\nled a wild life, during part of which he adopted the profession of a\r\nsoldier, until at length he took refuge in a Benedictine convent near\r\nBrescia, in 1507, and became a monk. The discipline of this house\r\nhad become entirely relaxed, and the monks appear to have lived very\r\nlicentiously; and Folengo, who, on his admission to the order, had\r\nexchanged his former baptismal name for Teofilo, readily conformed to\r\ntheir example. Eventually he abandoned the convent and the habit, ran\r\naway with a lady named Girolama Dedia, and for some years he led a\r\nwandering, and, it would seem, very irregular life. Finally, in 1527,\r\nhe returned to his old profession of a monk, and remained in it until\r\nhis death, in the December of 1544. He is said to have been extremely\r\nvain of his poetical talents, and a story is told of him which, even if\r\nit were invented, illustrates well the character which was popularly\r\ngiven to him. It is said that when young, he aspired to excel in\r\nLatin poetry, and that he wrote an epic which he himself believed to\r\nbe _superior_ to the Æneid. When, however, he had communicated the\r\nwork to his friend the bishop of Mantua, and that prelate, intending\r\nto compliment him, told him that he had equalled Virgil, he was so\r\nmortified, that he threw the manuscript on the fire, and from that time\r\ndevoted his talents entirely to the composition of macaronic verse.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who has justly earned the reputation of being the\r\nfirst of macaronic poets. When he adopted this branch of literature,\r\nwhile he was in the university of Bologna, he assumed in writing it\r\nthe name of Merlinus Cocaius, or Coccaius, probably from the name of\r\nhis professor at Ferrara. Folengo's printed poems consist of--1. The\r\nZanitonella, a pastoral in seven eclogues, describing the love of\r\nTonellus for Zanina; 2, the macaronic romance of Baldus, Folengo's\r\nprincipal and most remarkable work; 3, the Moschæa, or dreadful battle\r\nbetween the flies and the ants; and 4, a book of Epistles and Epigrams.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the Baldus appeared in 1517. It is a sort of\r\nparody on the romances of chivalry, and combines a jovial satire upon\r\neverything, which, as has been remarked, spares neither religion nor\r\npolitics, science nor literature, popes, kings, clergy, nobility, or\r\npeople. It consists of twenty-five cantos, or, as they are termed in\r\nthe original, _phantasiæ_, fantasies. In the first we are told of the\r\norigin of Baldus. There was at the court of France a famous knight\r\nnamed Guy, descended from that memorable paladin Renaud of Montauban.\r\nThe king, who showed a particular esteem for Guy, had also a daughter\r\nof surpassing beauty, named Balduine, who had fallen in love with\r\nGuy, and he was equally amorous of the princess. In the sequel of a\r\ngrand tournament, at which Guy has distinguished himself greatly, he\r\ncarries off Balduine, and the two lovers fly on foot, in the disguise\r\nof beggars, reach the Alps in safety, and cross them into Italy. At\r\nCipada, in the territory of Brescia, they are hospitably entertained by\r\na generous peasant named Berte Panade, with whom the princess Balduine,\r\nwho approaches her time of confinement, is left; while her lover goes\r\nforth to conquer at least a marquisate for her. After his departure\r\nshe gives birth to a fine boy, which is named Baldus. Such, as told\r\nin the second canto, is the origin of Folengo's hero, who is destined\r\nto perform marvellous acts of chivalry. The peasant Berte Panade has\r\nalso a son named Zambellus, by a mother who had died in childbirth\r\nof him. Baldus passes for the son of Berte also, so that the two are\r\nsupposed to be brothers. Baldus is successively led through a series of\r\nextraordinary adventures, some low and vulgar, others more chivalrous,\r\nand some of them exhibiting a wild fertility of imagination, which are\r\ntoo long to enable me to take my readers through them, until at length\r\nhe is left by the poet in the country of Falsehood and Charlatanism,\r\nwhich is inhabited by astrologers, necromancers, and poets. Thus\r\nis the hero Baldus dragged through a great number of marvellous\r\naccidents, some of them vulgar, many of them ridiculous, and some,\r\nagain, wildly poetical, but all of them presenting, in one form or\r\nother, an opportunity for satire upon some of the follies, or vices,\r\nor corruptions of his age. The hybrid language in which the whole is\r\nwritten, gives it a singularly grotesque appearance; yet from time to\r\ntime we have passages which show that the author was capable of writing\r\ntrue poetry, although it is mixed with a great amount of coarse and\r\nlicentious ideas, expressed no less coarsely and licentiously. What we\r\nmay term the filth, indeed, forms a large proportion of the Italian\r\nmacaronic poetry. The pastoral of Zanitonella presents, as might be\r\nexpected, more poetic beauty than the romance of Balbus. As an example\r\nof the language of the latter, and indeed of that of the Italian\r\nmacaronics in general, I give a few lines of a description of a storm\r\nat sea, from the twelfth canto, with a literal translation:--\r\n\r\n          _Jam gridor æterias hominum concussit abyssos,\r\n          Sentiturque ingens cordarum stridor, et ipse\r\n          Pontus habet pavidos vultus, mortisque colores.\r\n          Nunc Sirochus habit palmam, nunc Borra superchiat;\r\n          Irrugit pelagus, tangit quoque fluctibus astra,\r\n          Fulgure flammigero creber lampezat Olympus;\r\n          Vela forata micant crebris lacerata balottis;\r\n          Horrendam mortem nautis ea cuncta minazzant.\r\n          Nunc sbalzata ratis celsum tangebat Olympum,\r\n          Nunc subit infernam unda sbadacchiante paludem._\r\n\r\n                              TRANSLATION\r\n\r\n          _Now the clamour of the men shook the ethereal abysses,\r\n          And the mighty crashing of the ropes is felt, and the very\r\n          Sea has pale looks, and the hue of death.\r\n          Now the Sirocco has the palm, now Eurus exults over it;\r\n          The sea roars, and touches the stars with its waves,\r\n          Olympus continually blazes out with flaming thunder,\r\n          The pierced sails glitter torn with frequent thunderbolts;\r\n          All these threaten frightful death to the sailors.\r\n          Now the ship tossed up touched the top of Olympus,\r\n          Now, the wave yawning, it sinks into the infernal lake._\r\n\r\nTeofilo Folengo was followed by a number of imitators, of whom it\r\nwill be sufficient to state that he stands in talent as far above his\r\nfollowers as above those who preceded him. One of these minor Italian\r\nmacaronic writers, named Bartolommeo Bolla, of Bergamo, who flourished\r\nin the latter half of the sixteenth century, had the vanity to call\r\nhimself, in the title of one of his books, \"the Apollo of poets, and\r\nthe Cocaius of this age;\" but a modern critic has remarked of him\r\nthat he is as far removed from his model Folengo, as his native\r\ntown Bergamo is distant from Siberia. An earlier poet, named Guarino\r\nCapella, a native of the town of Sarsina, in the country of Forli, on\r\nthe borders of Tuscany, approached far nearer in excellence to the\r\nprince of macaronic writers. His work also is a mock romance, the\r\nhistory of \"Cabrinus, king of Gagamagoga,\" in six books or cantos,\r\nwhich was printed at Arimini in 1526, and is now a book of excessive\r\nrarity.\r\n\r\nThe taste for macaronics passed rather early, like all other fashions\r\nin that age, from Italy into France, where it first brought into\r\nliterary reputation a man who, if he had not the great talent of\r\nFolengo, possessed a very considerable amount of wit and gaiety.\r\nAntoine de la Sable, who Latinised his name into Antonius de Arena,\r\nwas born of a highly respectable family at Soliers, in the diocese\r\nof Toulon, about the year 1500, and, being destined from his youth\r\nto follow the profession of the law, studied under the celebrated\r\njurisconsult Alciatus. He had only arrived at the simple dignity of\r\n_juge_, at St. Remy, in the diocese of Arles, when he died in the year\r\n1544. In fact, he appears to have been no very diligent student, and we\r\ngather from his own confessions that his youth had been rather wild.\r\nThe volume containing his macaronics, the second edition of which (as\r\nfar as the editions are known) was printed in 1529, bears a title which\r\nwill give some notion of the character of its contents,--\"_Provencalis\r\nde bragardissima villa de Soleriis, ad suos compagnones qui sunt de\r\npersona friantes, bassas dansas et branlas practicantes novellas, de\r\nguerra Romana, Neapolitana, et Genuensi mandat; una cum epistola ad\r\nfalotissimam suam garsam, Janam Rosæam, pro passando tempora_\"--(_i.e._\r\na Provençal of the most swaggering town of Soliers, sends this to his\r\ncompanions, who are dainty of their persons, practising basse dances\r\nand new brawls, concerning the war of Rome, Naples, and Genoa; with an\r\nepistle to his most merry wench, Jeanne Rosée, for pastime). In the\r\nfirst of these poems Arena traces in his burlesque verse, which is an\r\nimitation of Folengo, his own adventures and sufferings in the war in\r\nItaly which led to the sack of Rome, in 1527, and in the subsequent\r\nexpeditions to Naples and Genoa. From the picture of the horrors of\r\nwar, he passes very willingly to describe the joyous manners of the\r\nstudents in Provençal universities, of whom he tells us, that they are\r\nall fine gallants, and always in love with the pretty girls.\r\n\r\n          _Gentigalantes sunt omnes instudiantes,\r\n              Et bellas garsas semper amare solent._\r\n\r\nHe goes on to describe the scholars as great quarrellers, as well as\r\nlovers of the other sex, and after dwelling on their gaiety and love\r\nof the dance, he proceeds to treat in the same burlesque style on the\r\nsubject of dancing; but I pass over this to speak of Arena's principal\r\npiece, the satirical description of the invasion of Provence by the\r\nemperor Charles V. in 1536. This curious poem, which is entitled\r\n\"Meygra Enterprisa Catoloqui imperatoris,\" and which extends to upwards\r\nof two thousand lines, opens with a laudatory address to the king of\r\nFrance, François I., and with a sneer at the pride of the emperor, who,\r\nbelieving himself to be the master of the whole world, had foolishly\r\nthought to take away France and the cities of Provence from their\r\nrightful monarch. It was Antonio de Leyva, the boaster, who had put\r\nthis project into the emperor's head, and they had already pillaged\r\nand ravaged a good part of Provence, and were dividing the plunder,\r\nwhen, harassed continually by the peasantry, the invaders were brought\r\nto a stand by the difficulty of subsisting in a devastated country,\r\nand by the diseases to which this difficulty gave rise. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Spaniards and their allies committed terrible devastation, which\r\nis described by Arena in strong language. He commemorates the valiant\r\nresistance of his native town of Soliers, which, however, was taken\r\nand sacked, and he lost in it his house and property. Arles held the\r\nimperialists at bay, while the French, under the constable Montmorency,\r\nestablished themselves firmly at Avignon. At length disease gained\r\npossession of Antonio de Leyva himself, and the emperor, who had been\r\nmaking an unsuccessful demonstration against Marseilles, came to him\r\nin his sickness. The first lines of the description of this interview,\r\nwill serve as a specimen of the language of the French macaronics:--\r\n\r\n        _Sed de Marsella bragganti quando retornat,\r\n          Fort male contentus, quando repolsat eum,\r\n        Antonium Levam trobavit forte maladum,\r\n          Cui mors terribilis triste cubile parat.\r\n        Ethica torquet eum per costas, et dolor ingens:\r\n          Cum male res vadit, vivere fachat eum.\r\n        Dixerunt medici, speransa est nulla salutis:\r\n          Ethicus in testa vivere pauca potest.\r\n        Ante suam mortem voluit parlare per horam\r\n          Imperelatori, consiliumque dare.\r\n        Scis, Cæsar, stricte nostri groppantur amores,\r\n          Namque duas animas corpus utrumque tenet,\r\n        Heu! fuge Provensam fortem, fuge littus amarum,\r\n          Fac tibi non noceat gloria tanta modo._\r\n\r\n                         TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n        _But when he returns from boasting Marseilles,\r\n          Very ill content, that she had repulsed him,\r\n        He found Antonio de Leyva very ill,\r\n          For whom terrible death is preparing a sorrowful bed.\r\n        Hectic fever tortures him in the ribs, and great pain;\r\n          Since things are going ill, he is weary of life.\r\n        Before his death he wished to speak an hour\r\n          To the emperor, and to give him counsel.\r\n        \"You know, Cæsar, our affections are closely bound together,\r\n          For either body holds the two souls,\r\n        Alas! fly Provence the strong, fly the bitter shore,\r\n          Take care that your great glory prove not an injury to you.\"_\r\n\r\nThus Leyva goes on to persuade the emperor to abandon his enterprise,\r\nand then dies. Arena exults over his death, and over the emperor's\r\ngrief for his loss, and then proceeds to describe the disastrous\r\nretreat of the imperial army, and the glory of France in her king.\r\n\r\nAntonius de Arena wrote with vigour and humour, but his verses are\r\ntame in comparison with his model, Folengo. The taste for macaronic\r\nverse never took strong root in France, and the few obscure writers\r\nwho attempted to shine in that kind of composition are now forgotten,\r\nexcept by the laborious bibliographer. One named Jean Germain, wrote\r\na macaronic history of the invasion of Provence by the imperialists\r\nin rivalry of Arenas. I will not follow the taste for this class of\r\nburlesque composition into Spain or Germany, but merely add that it\r\nwas not adopted in England until the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when several authors employed it at about the same time.\r\nThe most perfect example of these early English macaronics is the\r\n\"Polemo-Middiana,\" _i.e._ battle of the dunghill, by the talented and\r\nelegant-minded Drummond of Hawthornden. We may take a single example of\r\nthe English macaronic from this poem, which will not need an English\r\ntranslation. One of the female characters in the dunghill war, calls,\r\namong others, to her aid--\r\n\r\n        _Hunc qui dirtiferas tersit cum dishclouty dishras,\r\n        Hunc qui gruelias scivit bene lickere plettas,\r\n        Et saltpannifumos, et widebricatos fisheros,\r\n        Hellæosque etiam salteros duxit ab antris,\r\n        Coalheughos nigri girnantes more divelli;\r\n        Lifeguardamque sibi sævas vocat improba lassas,\r\n        Maggyam magis doctam milkare covœas,\r\n        Et doctam suepare flouras, et sternere beddas,\r\n        Quæque novit spinnare, et longas ducere threddas;\r\n        Nansyam, claves bene quæ keepaverat omnes,\r\n        Quæque lanam cardare solet greasy-fingria Betty._\r\n\r\nPerhaps before this was written, the eccentric Thomas Coryat had\r\npublished in the volume of his Crudities, printed in 1611, a short\r\npiece of verse, which is perfect in its macaronic style, but in which\r\nItalian and other foreign words are introduced, as well as English. The\r\ncelebrated comedy of \"Ignoramus,\" composed by George Ruggle in 1615,\r\nmay also be mentioned as containing many excellent examples of English\r\nmacaronics.\r\n\r\nWhile Italy was giving birth to macaronic verse, the satire upon the\r\nignorance and bigotry of the clergy was taking another form in Germany,\r\nwhich arose from some occurrences which it will be necessary to relate.\r\nIn the midst of the violent religious agitation at the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century in Germany, there lived a German Jew named\r\nPfeffercorn, who embraced Christianity, and to show his zeal for his\r\nnew faith, he obtained from the emperor an edict ordering the Talmud\r\nand all the Jewish writings which were contrary to the Christian faith\r\nto be burnt. There lived at the same time a scholar of distinction,\r\nand of more liberal views than most of the scholastics of his time,\r\nnamed John Reuchlin. He was a relative of Melancthon, and was secretary\r\nto the palsgrave, who was tolerant like himself. The Jews, as might\r\nbe expected, were unwilling to give up their books to be burnt, and\r\nReuchlin wrote in their defence, under the assumed name of Capnion,\r\nwhich is a Hebrew translation of his own name of Reuchlin, meaning\r\nsmoke, and urged that it was better to refute the books in question\r\nthan to burn them. The converted Pfeffercorn replied in a book entitled\r\n\"Speculum Manuale,\" in answer to which Reuchlin wrote his \"Speculum\r\nOculare.\" The controversy had already provoked much bigoted ill-feeling\r\nagainst Reuchlin. The learned doctors of the university of Cologne\r\nespoused the cause of Pfeffercorn, and the principal of the university,\r\nnamed in Latin Ortuinus Gratius, supported by the Sorbonne in Paris,\r\nlent himself to be the violent organ of the intolerant party. Hard\r\npressed by his bigoted opponents, Reuchlin found good allies, but one\r\nof the best of these was a brave baron named Ulric von Hutten, of an\r\nold and noble family, born in 1488 in the castle of Staeckelberg,\r\nin Franconia. He had studied in the schools at Fulda, Cologne, and\r\nFrankfort on the Oder, and distinguished himself so much as a scholar,\r\nthat he obtained the degree of Master of Arts before the usual age.\r\nBut Ulric possessed an adventurous and chivalrous spirit, which led\r\nhim to embrace the profession of a soldier, and he served in the wars\r\nin Italy, where he was distinguished by his bravery. He was at Rome\r\nin 1516, and defended Reuchlin against the Dominicans. The same year\r\nappeared the first edition of that marvellous book, the \"Epistolæ\r\nObscurorum Virorum,\" one of the most remarkable satires that the world\r\nhas yet seen. It is believed that this book came entirely from the\r\npen of Ulric von Hutten; and the notion that Reuchlin himself, or\r\nany others of his friends, had a share in it appears to be without\r\nfoundation. Ulric was in the following year made poet-laureat.\r\nNevertheless, this book greatly incensed the monks against him, and he\r\nwas often threatened with assassination. Yet he boldly advocated the\r\ncause and embraced the opinions of Luther, and was one of the staunch\r\nsupporters of Lutheranism. After a very turbulent life, Ulric von\r\nHutten died in the August of the year 1523.\r\n\r\nThe \"Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum,\" or letters of obscure men, are\r\nsupposed to be addressed to Ortuinus Gratius, mentioned above, by\r\nvarious individuals, some his scholars, others his friends, but all\r\nbelonging to the bigoted party opposed to Reuchlin, and they were\r\ndesigned to throw ridicule on the ignorance, bigotry, and immorality\r\nof the clergy of the Romish church. The old scholastic learning\r\nhad become debased into a heavy and barbarous system of theology,\r\nliterary composition consisted in writing a no less barbarous Latin,\r\nand even the few classical writers who were admitted into the schools,\r\nwere explained and commented upon in a strange half-theological\r\nfashion. These old scholastics were bitterly opposed to the new\r\nlearning, which had taken root in Italy, and was spreading abroad,\r\nand they spoke contemptuously of it as \"secular.\" The letters of the\r\nobscure individuals relate chiefly to the dispute between Reuchlin\r\nand Pfeffercorn, to the rivalry between the old scholarship and the\r\nnew, and to the low licentious lives of the theologists; and they\r\nare written in a style of Latin which is intended for a parody on\r\nthat of the latter, and which closely resembles that which we call\r\n\"dog-Latin.\"[97] They are full of wit and humour of the most exquisite\r\ndescription, but they too often descend into details, treated in terms\r\nwhich can only be excused by the coarse and licentious character of\r\nthe age. The literary and scientific questions discussed in these\r\nletters are often very droll. The first in order of the correspondents\r\nof Ortuinus Gratius, who boasts of the rather formidable name, Thomas\r\nLangschneiderius, and addresses master Ortuinus as \"poet, orator,\r\nphilosopher, and theologist, and more if he would,\" propounds to him a\r\ndifficult question:--\r\n\r\n     \"There was here one day an Aristotelian dinner, and doctors,\r\n     licenciates, and masters too, were very jovial, and I was\r\n     there too, and we drank at the first course three draughts of\r\n     Malmsey, ... and then we had six dishes of flesh and chickens\r\n     and capons, and one of fish, and as we passed from one dish to\r\n     another, we continually drunk wine of Kotzburg and the Rhine,\r\n     and ale of Embeck, and Thurgen, and Neuburg. And the masters\r\n     were well satisfied, and said that the new masters had acquitted\r\n     themselves well and with great honour. Then the masters in their\r\n     hilarity began to talk learnedly on great questions, and one\r\n     asked whether it were correct to say _magister nostrandus_, or\r\n     _noster magistrandus_, for a person fit to be made doctor in\r\n     theology.... And immediately Master Warmsemmel, who is a subtle\r\n     Scotist, and has been master eighteen years, and was in his time\r\n     twice rejected and thrice delayed for the degree of master,\r\n     and he went on offering himself, until he was promoted for the\r\n     honour of the university, ... spoke, and held that we should say\r\n     _noster magistrandus_.... Then Master Andreas Delitsch, who is\r\n     very subtle, and half poet, half artist (_i.e._ one who professed\r\n     in the faculty of arts), physician, and jurist; and now he\r\n     reads ordinarily 'Ovid on the Metamorphoses,' and expounds all\r\n     the fables allegorically and literally, and I was his hearer,\r\n     because he expounds very fundamentally, and he also reads at home\r\n     Quintillian and Juvencus, and he held the opposite to Master\r\n     Warmsemmel, and said that we ought to say _magister nostrandus_.\r\n     For as there is a difference between _magister noster_ and _noster\r\n     magister_, so also there is a difference between _magister\r\n     nostrandus_ and _noster magistrandus_; for a doctor in theology\r\n     is called _magister noster_, and it is one word, but _noster\r\n     magister_ are two words, and it is taken for any master; and he\r\n     quoted Horace in support of this. Then the masters much admired\r\n     his subtlety, and one drank to him a cup of Neuburg ale. And\r\n     he said, 'I will wait, but spare me,' and touched his hat, and\r\n     laughed heartily, and drank to Master Warmsemmel, and said,\r\n     'There, master, don't think I am an enemy,' and he drank it off at\r\n     one draught, and Master Warmsemmel replied to him with a strong\r\n     draught. And the masters were all merry till the bell rang for\r\n     Vespers.\"\r\n\r\n [97] This style differs entirely from the macaronic. It consists\r\n      merely in using the words of the Latin language with the forms\r\n      and construction of the vulgar tongue, as illustrated by the\r\n      directions of the professor who, lecturing in the schools, was\r\n      interrupted by the entrance of a dog, and shouted out to the\r\n      doorkeeper, _Verte canem ex_, meaning thereby that he should\r\n      \"turn the dog out.\" It was perhaps from this, or some similar\r\n      occurrence, that this barbarous Latin gained the name of\r\n      dog-Latin. The French call it _Latin de cuisine_.\r\n\r\nMaster Ortuin is pressed for his judgment on this weighty question. A\r\nsimilar scene described in another letter ends less peacefully. The\r\ncorrespondent on this occasion is Magister Bornharddus Plumilegus, who\r\naddresses Ortuinus Gratius as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Wretched is the mouse which has only one hole for a refuge! So\r\n     also I may say of myself, most venerable sir, for I should be poor\r\n     if I had only one friend, and when that one should fail me, then\r\n     I should not have another to treat me with kindness. As is the\r\n     case now with a certain poet here, who is called George Sibutus,\r\n     and he is one of the secular poets, and reads publicly in poetry,\r\n     and is in other respects a good fellow (_bonus socius_). But as\r\n     you know these poets, when they are not theologists like you, will\r\n     always reprehend others, and despise the theologists. And once\r\n     in a drinking party in his house, when we were drinking Thurgen\r\n     ale, and sat until the hour of tierce, and I was moderately drunk,\r\n     because that ale rose into my head, then there was one who was not\r\n     before friendly with me, and I drank to him half a cup, and he\r\n     accepted it. But afterwards he would not return the compliment.\r\n     And thrice I cautioned him, and he would not reply, but sat in\r\n     silence and said nothing. Then I thought to myself, Behold this\r\n     man treats thee with contempt, and is proud, and always wants to\r\n     confound you. And I was stirred in my anger, and took the cup, and\r\n     threw it at his head. Then that poet was angry at me, and said\r\n     that I had caused a disturbance in his house, and said I should go\r\n     out of his house in the devil's name. Then I replied, 'What matter\r\n     is it if you are my enemy? I have had as bad enemies as you, and\r\n     yet I have stood in spite of them. What matters it if you are a\r\n     poet? I have other poets who are my friends, and they are quite as\r\n     good as you, _ego bene merdarem in vestram poetriam_! Do you think\r\n     I am a fool, or that I was born under a tree like apples?' Then he\r\n     called me an ass, and said that I never saw a poet. And I said,\r\n     'You are an ass in your skin, I have seen many more poets than\r\n     you.' And I spoke of you.... Wherefore I ask you very earnestly to\r\n     write me one piece of verse, and then I will show it to this poet\r\n     and others, and I will boast that you are my friend, and you are a\r\n     much better poet than he.\"\r\n\r\nThe war against the secular poets, or advocates of the new learning,\r\nis kept up with spirit through this ludicrous correspondence. One\r\ncorrespondent presses Ortuinus Gratius to \"write to me whether it be\r\nnecessary for eternal salvation that scholars learn grammar from the\r\nsecular poets, such as Virgil, Tullius, Pliny, and others; for,\" he\r\nadds, \"it seems to me that this is not a good method of studying.\" \"As\r\nI have often written to you,\" says another, \"I am grieved that this\r\nribaldry (_ista ribaldria_), namely, the faculty of poetry, becomes\r\ncommon, and is spread through all provinces and regions. In my time\r\nthere was only one poet, who was called Samuel; and now, in this city\r\nalone, there are at least twenty, and they vex us all who hold with the\r\nancients. Lately I thoroughly defeated one, who said that _scholaris_\r\ndoes not signify a person who goes to the school for the purpose of\r\nlearning; and I said, 'Ass! will you correct the holy doctor who\r\nexpounded this word?'\" The new learning was, of course, identified\r\nwith the supporters of Reuchlin. \"It is said here,\" continues the same\r\ncorrespondent, \"that all the poets will side with doctor Reuchlin\r\nagainst the theologians. I wish all the poets were in the place where\r\npepper grows, that they might let us go in peace!\"\r\n\r\nMaster William Lamp, \"master of arts,\" sends to Master Ortuinus\r\nGratius, a narrative of his adventures in a journey from Cologne to\r\nRome. First he went to Mayence, where his indignation was moved by the\r\nopen manner in which people spoke in favour of Reuchlin, and when he\r\nhazarded a contrary opinion, he was only laughed at, but he held his\r\ntongue, because his opponents all carried arms and looked fierce. \"One\r\nof them is a count, and is a long man, and has white hair; and they\r\nsay that he takes a man in armour in his hand, and throws him to the\r\nground, and he has a sword as long as a giant; when I saw him, then I\r\nheld my tongue.\" At Worms, he found things no better, for the \"doctors\"\r\nspoke bitterly against the theologians, and when he attempted to\r\nexpostulate, he got foul words as well as threats, a learned doctor in\r\nmedicine affirming \"_quod merdaret super nos omnes_.\" On leaving Worms,\r\nLamp and his companion, another theologist, fell in with plunderers who\r\nmade them pay two florins to drink, \"and I said _occulte_, Drink what\r\nmay the devil bless to you!\" Subsequently they fell into low amours\r\nat country inns, which are described coarsely, and then they reached\r\nInsprucken, where they found the emperor, and his court and army, with\r\nwhole manners and proceedings Magister Lamp became sorely disgusted.\r\nI pass over other adventures till they reach Mantua, the birthplace\r\nof Virgil, and of a late mediæval Latin poet, named from it Baptista\r\nMantuanus. Lamp, in his hostile spirit towards the \"secular poets,\"\r\nproceeds,--\"And my companion said, 'Here Virgil was born.' I replied,\r\n'What do I care for that pagan? We will go to the Carmelites, and see\r\nBaptista Mantuanus, who is twice as good as Virgil, as I have heard\r\nfull ten times from Ortuinus;' and I told him how you once reprehended\r\nDonatus, when he says, 'Virgil was the most learned of poets, and\r\nthe best;' and you said, 'If Donatus were here, I would tell him to\r\nhis face that he lies, for Baptista Mantuanus is above Virgil.' And\r\nwhen we came to the monastery of the Carmelites, we were told that\r\nBaptista Mantuanus was dead; then I said, 'May he rest in peace!'\" They\r\ncontinued their journey by Bologna, where they found the inquisitor\r\nJacob de Hochstraten, and Florence, to Siena. \"After this there are\r\nsmall towns, and one is called Monte-flascon, where we drunk excellent\r\nwine, such as I never drank in my life. And I asked the host what that\r\nwine is called, and he replied that it is lachryma Christi. Then said\r\nmy companion, 'I wish Christ would cry in our country!' And so we drank\r\na good bout, and two days after we entered Rome.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of these letters the theologists, the poets especially,\r\nthe character of the clergy, and particularly Reuchlin and\r\nPfeffercorn, afford continual subjects for dispute and pleasantry.\r\nThe last mentioned individual, in the opinion of some, had merited\r\nhanging for theft, and it was pretended that the Jews had expelled\r\nhim from their society for his wicked courses. One argued that all\r\nJews stink, and as it was well known that Pfeffercorn continued to\r\nstink like a Jew, it was quite evident that he could not be a good\r\nChristian. Some of Ortuinus's correspondents consult him on difficult\r\ntheological questions. Here is an example in a letter from one Henricus\r\nSchaffmulius, another of his scholars who had made the journey to\r\nRome:--\r\n\r\n     \"Since, before I journeyed to the Court, you said to me that I am\r\n     to write often to you, and that sometimes I am to send you any\r\n     theological questions, which you will solve for me better than\r\n     the courtiers of Rome, therefore now I ask your mastership what\r\n     you hold as to the case when any one on a Friday, or any other\r\n     fast day, eats an egg, and there is a chicken inside. Because\r\n     the other day we sat in a tavern in the Campo-flore, and made a\r\n     collation, and eat eggs, and I, opening an egg, saw that there was\r\n     a young chicken in it, which I showed to my companion, and then he\r\n     said, 'Eat it quickly before the host sees it, for if he sees it,\r\n     then you will be obliged to give a carlino or a julio for a hen,\r\n     because it is the custom here that, when the host places anything\r\n     on the table, you must pay for it, for they will not take it back.\r\n     And when he sees there is a young hen in the egg, he will say,\r\n     Pay me for the hen, because he reckons a small one the same as a\r\n     large one.' And I immediately sucked up the egg, and with it the\r\n     chicken, and afterwards I bethought me that it was Friday, and I\r\n     said to my companion. 'You have caused me to commit a mortal sin,\r\n     in eating flesh on Friday.' And he said that it is not a mortal\r\n     sin, nor even a venial sin, because that embryo of a chicken is\r\n     not reckoned other than an egg till it is born; and he told me\r\n     that it is as in cheeses, in which there are sometimes worms,\r\n     and in cherries, and fresh peas and beans, yet they are eaten on\r\n     Fridays, and also in the vigils of the apostles. But the hosts\r\n     are such rogues, that they say that they are flesh, that they may\r\n     have more money. Then I went away, and thought about it. And, _per\r\n     Deum_! Magister Ortuinus, I am much troubled, and I know not how\r\n     I ought to rule myself. If I went to ask advice of a courtier [of\r\n     the papal court], I know that they have not good consciences. It\r\n     seems to me that these young hens in the eggs are flesh, because\r\n     the matter is already formed and figured in members and bodies of\r\n     an animal, and it has life; it is otherwise with worms in cheeses\r\n     and other things, because worms are reputed for fishes, as I have\r\n     heard from a physician, who is a very good naturalist. Therefore I\r\n     ask you very earnestly, that you will give me your reply on this\r\n     question. Because if you hold that it is a mortal sin, then I will\r\n     purchase an absolution here, before I return to Germany. Also you\r\n     must know that our master Jacobus de Hochstraten has obtained a\r\n     thousand florins from the bank, and I think that with these he\r\n     will gain his cause, and the devil confound that John Reuchlin,\r\n     and the other poets and jurists, because they will be against\r\n     the church of God, that is, against the theologists, in whom is\r\n     founded the church, as Christ said: Thou art Peter, and upon this\r\n     rock I will build my church. And so I commend you to the Lord God.\r\n     Farewell. Given from the city of Rome.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Italy macaronic literature was reaching its greatest\r\nperfection, there arose in the very centre of France a man of great\r\noriginal genius, who was soon to astonish the world by a new form of\r\nsatire, more grotesque and more comprehensive than anything that had\r\nbeen seen before. Teofilo Folengo may fairly be considered as the\r\nprecursor of Rabelais, who appears to have taken the Italian satirist\r\nas his model. What we know of the life of François Rabelais is rather\r\nobscure at best, and is in some parts no doubt fabulous. He was born\r\nat Chinon in Touraine, either in 1483 or in 1487, for this seems to\r\nbe a disputed point, and some doubt has been thrown on the trade or\r\nprofession of his father, but the most generally received opinion is\r\nthat he was an apothecary. He is said to have shown from his youth a\r\ndisposition more inclined to gaiety than to serious pursuits, yet at\r\nan early age he had made great proficiency in learning, and is said to\r\nhave acquired a very sufficient knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew,\r\ntwo of which, at least, were not popular among the popish clergy, and\r\nnot only of the modern languages and literature of Italy, Germany, and\r\nSpain, but even of Arabic. Probably this estimate of his acquirements\r\nin learning is rather exaggerated. It is not quite clear where the\r\nyoung Rabelais gained all this knowledge, for he is said to have been\r\neducated in convents and among monks, and to have become at a rather\r\nearly age a Franciscan friar in the convent of Fontenai-le-Compte, in\r\nLower Poitou, where he became an object of jealousy and ill-feeling to\r\nthe other friars by his superior acquirements. It was a tradition, at\r\nleast, that the conduct of Rabelais was not very strictly conventual,\r\nand that he had so far shown his contempt for monastic rule, and for\r\nthe bigotry of the Romish church, that he was condemned to the prison\r\nof his monastery, upon a diet of bread and water, which, according to\r\ncommon report, was very uncongenial with the tastes of this jovial\r\nfriar. Out of this difficulty he is said to have been helped by his\r\nfriend the bishop of Maillezais, who obtained for him the pope's\r\nlicence to change the order of St. Francis for the much more easy and\r\nliberal order of St. Benedict, and he became a member of the bishop's\r\nown chapter in the abbey of Maillezais. His unsteady temper, however,\r\nwas not long satisfied with this retreat, which he left, and, laying\r\naside the regular habit, assumed that of a secular priest. In this\r\ncharacter he wandered for some time, and then settled at Montpellier,\r\nwhere he took a degree as doctor in medicine, and practised for some\r\ntime with credit. There he published in 1532 a translation of some\r\nworks of Hippocrates and Galen, which he dedicated to his friend the\r\nbishop of Maillezais. The circumstances under which he left Montpellier\r\nare not known, but he is supposed to have gone to Paris upon some\r\nbusiness of the university, and to have remained there. He found\r\nthere a staunch friend in Jean de Bellay, bishop of Paris, who soon\r\nafterwards was raised to the rank of cardinal. When the cardinal de\r\nBellay went as ambassador to Rome from the court of France, Rabelais\r\naccompanied him, it is said in the character of his private medical\r\nadviser, but during his stay in the metropolis of Christendom, as\r\nChristendom was understood in those days by the Romish church, Rabelais\r\nobtained, on the 17th of January, 1536 the papal absolution for all\r\nhis transgressions, and licence to return to Maillezais, and practise\r\nmedicine there and elsewhere as an act of charity. Thus he became again\r\na Benedictine monk. He, however, changed again, and became a secular\r\ncanon, and finally settled down as the curé of Meudon, near Paris, with\r\nwhich he also held a fair number of ecclesiastical benefices. Rabelais\r\ndied in 1553, according to some in a very religious manner, but others\r\nhave given strange accounts of his last moments, representing that,\r\neven when dying, he conversed in the same spirit of mockery, not only\r\nof Romish forms and ceremonies, but of all religions whatever, which\r\nwas ascribed to him during his life, and which are but too openly\r\nmanifested in the extraordinary satirical romance which has given so\r\nmuch celebrity to his name.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of his life, Rabelais was exposed to troubles\r\nand persecutions. He was saved from the intrigues of the monks by\r\nthe friendly influence of popes and cardinals; and the favour of two\r\nsuccessive kings, François I. and Henri II., protected him against the\r\nstill more dangerous hostility of the Sorbonne and the parliament of\r\nParis. This high protection has been advanced as a reason for rejecting\r\nthe anecdotes and accounts which have been commonly received relating\r\nto the personal character of Rabelais, and his irregularities may\r\npossibly have been exaggerated by the hatred which he had drawn upon\r\nhimself by his writings. But nobody, I think, who knows the character\r\nof society at that time, who compares what we know of the lives of\r\nthe other satirists, and who has read the history of Gargantua and\r\nPantagruel, will consider such an argument of much weight against the\r\ndeliberate statements of those who were his contemporaries, or be\r\ninclined to doubt that the writer of this history was a man of jovial\r\ncharacter, who loved a good bottle and a broad joke, and perhaps other\r\nthings that were equally objectionable. His books present a sort\r\nof wild riotous orgy, without much order or plan, except the mere\r\noutline of the story, in which is displayed an extraordinary extent\r\nof reading in all classes of literature, from the most learned to the\r\nmost popular, with a wonderful command of language, great imagination,\r\nand some poetry, intermixed with a perhaps larger amount of downright\r\nobscene ribaldry, than can be found in the macaronics of Folengo,\r\nin the \"Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum,\" or in the works of any of the\r\nother satirists who had preceded him, or were his contemporaries. It\r\nis a broad caricature, poor enough in its story, but enriched with\r\ndetails, which are brilliant with imagery, though generally coarse,\r\nand which are made the occasions for turning to ridicule everything\r\nthat existed. The five books of this romance were published separately\r\nand at different periods, apparently without any fixed intention of\r\ncontinuing them. The earlier editions of the first part were published\r\nwithout date, but the earliest editions with dates belong to the year\r\n1535, when it was several times reprinted. It appeared as the life of\r\nGargantua. This hero is supposed to have flourished in the first half\r\nof the fifteenth century, and to have been the son of Grandgousier,\r\nking of Utopia, a country which lay somewhere in the direction of\r\nChinon, a prince of an ancient dynasty, but a jovial fellow, who loved\r\ngood eating and drinking better than anything else. Grandgousier\r\nmarried Gargamelle, daughter of the king of the Parpaillos, who became\r\nthe mother of Gargantua. The first chapters relate rather minutely\r\nhow the child was born, and came out at its mother's ear, why it was\r\ncalled Gargantua, how it was dressed and treated in infancy, what were\r\nits amusements and disposition, and how Gargantua was put to learning\r\nunder the sophists, and made no progress. Thereupon Grandgousier sent\r\nhis son to Paris, to seek instruction there, and he proceeds thither\r\nmounted on an immense mare, which had been sent as a present by the\r\nking of Numidia--it must be borne in mind that the royal race of Utopia\r\nwere all giants. At Paris the populace assembled tumultuously to\r\ngratify their curiosity in looking at this new scholar; but Gargantua,\r\nbesides treating them in a very contemptuous manner, carried off the\r\ngreat bells of Notre Dame to suspend at the neck of his mare. Great\r\nwas the indignation caused by this theft. \"All the city was risen up\r\nin sedition, they being, as you know, upon any slight occasions, so\r\nready to uproars and insurrections, that foreign nations wonder at the\r\npatience of the kings of France, who do not by good justice restrain\r\nthem from such tumultuous courses.\" The citizens take counsel, and\r\nresolve on sending one of the great orators of the university, Master\r\nJanotus de Bragmardo, to expostulate with Gargantua, and obtain the\r\nrestoration of the bells. The speech which this worthy addresses to\r\nGargantua, in fulfilment of his mission, is an amusing parody on the\r\npedantic style of Parisian oratory. The bells, however, are recovered,\r\nand Gargantua, under skilful instructors, pursues his studies with\r\ncredit, until he is suddenly called home by a letter from his father.\r\nIn fact, Grandgousier was suddenly involved in a war with his neighbour\r\nPicrocole, king of Lerné, caused by a quarrel about cakes between some\r\ncake-makers of Lerné and Grandgousier's shepherds, in consequence of\r\nwhich Picrocole had invaded the dominions of Grandgousier, and was\r\nplundering and ravaging them. His warlike humour is stirred up by the\r\ncounsels of his three lieutenants, who persuade him that he is going\r\nto become a great conqueror, and that they will make him master of the\r\nwhole world. It is not difficult to see, in the circumstances of the\r\ntime, the general aim of the satire contained in the history of this\r\nwar. It ends in the entire defeat and disappearance of king Picrocole.\r\nA sensual and jovial monk named brother Jean des Entommeurs, who has\r\nfirst distinguished himself by his prowess and strength in defending\r\nhis own abbey against the invaders, contributes largely to the victory\r\ngained by Gargantua against his father's enemies, and Gargantua\r\nrewards him by founding for him that pleasant abbey of Thélème, a\r\ngrand establishment, stored with everything which could contribute to\r\nterrestrial happiness, from which all hypocrites and bigots were to be\r\nexcluded, and the rule of which was comprised in the four simple words,\r\n\"Do as you like.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of Gargantua, which was afterwards formed by\r\nRabelais into the first book of his great comic romance. It was\r\npublished anonymously, the author merely describing himself as\r\n\"l'abstracteur de quinte essence;\" but he afterwards adopted the\r\npseudonyme of Alcofribas Nasier, which is merely an anagram of his own\r\nname, François Rabelais. A very improbable story has been handed down\r\nto us relating to this book. It is pretended that, having published\r\na book of medical science which had no sale, and the publisher\r\ncomplaining that he had lost money by it, Rabelais promised to make\r\namends for his loss, and immediately wrote the history of Gargantua,\r\nby which the same book-seller made his fortune. There can be no doubt\r\nthat this remarkable satire had a deeper origin than any casual\r\naccident like this; but it was exactly suited to the taste and temper\r\nof the age. It was quite original in its form and style, and it met\r\nwith immediate and great success. Numerous editions followed each\r\nother rapidly, and its author, encouraged by its popularity, very soon\r\nafterwards produced a second romance, in continuation, to which he\r\ngave the title of Pantagruel. The caricature in this second romance\r\nis bolder even than in the first, the humour broader, and the satire\r\nmore pungent. Grandgousier has disappeared from the scene, and his son,\r\nGargantua, is king, and has a son named Pantagruel, whose kingdom is\r\nthat of the Dipsodes. The first part of this new romance is occupied\r\nchiefly with Pantagruel's youth and education, and is a satire on\r\nthe university and on the lawyers, in which the parodies on their\r\nstyle of pleading as then practised is admirable. In the latter part,\r\nPantagruel, like his father Gargantua, is engaged in great wars. It was\r\nperhaps the continued success of this new production of his pen which\r\nled Rabelais to go on with it, and form the design of making these two\r\nbooks part only of a more extensive romance. During his studies in\r\nParis, Pantagruel has made the acquaintance of a singular individual\r\nnamed Panurge, who becomes his attached friend and constant companion,\r\nholding somewhat the position of brother Jean in the first book, but\r\nfar more crafty and versatile. The whole subject of the third book\r\narises out of Pantagreul's desire to marry, and its various amusing\r\nepisodes describe the different expedients which, at the suggestion of\r\nPanurge, he adopts to arrive at a solution of the question whether his\r\nmarriage would be fortunate or not.\r\n\r\nIn publishing his fourth book, Rabelais complains that his writings\r\nhad raised him enemies, and that he was accused of having at least\r\nwritten heresy. In fact, he had bitterly provoked both the monks and\r\nthe university and parliament; and, as the increasing reaction of\r\nRomanism in France gave more power of persecution to the two latter,\r\nhe was not writing without some degree of danger, yet the satire of\r\neach successive book became bolder and more direct. The fifth, which\r\nwas left unfinished at his death, and which was published posthumously,\r\nwas the most severe of them all. The character of Gargantua, indeed,\r\nwas almost forgotten in that of Pantagruel, and Pantagruelism became\r\nan accepted name for the sort of gay, reckless satire of which he was\r\nlooked upon as the model. He described it himself as a _certaine gaieté\r\nd'esprit confite en mépris des choses fortuites_, in fact, neither\r\nRomanism nor Protestantism, but simply a jovial kind of Epicurianism.\r\nAll the gay wits of the time aspired to be Pantagruelists, and the\r\nremainder of the sixteenth century abounded in wretched imitations of\r\nthe style of Rabelais, which are now consigned as mere rarities to the\r\nshelves of the bibliophilist.\r\n\r\nAmong the dangers which began to threaten them in France in the earlier\r\npart of the sixteenth century, liberal opinions found an asylum at the\r\ncourt of a princess who was equally distinguished by her beauty, by her\r\ntalents and noble sentiments, and by her accomplishments. Marguerite\r\nd'Angoulême, queen of Navarre, was the only sister of François I., who\r\nwas her junior by two years, and was affectionately attached to her.\r\nShe was born on the 11th of April, 1492. She had married, first, that\r\nunfortunate duke d'Alençon, whose misconduct at Pavia was the cause of\r\nthe disastrous defeat of the French, and the captivity of their king.\r\nThe duke died, it was said of grief at his misfortune, in 1525; and\r\ntwo years afterwards, on the 24th of January, 1527, she married Henri\r\nd'Albret, king of Navarre. Their daughter, Jeanne d'Albret, carried\r\nthis petty royalty to the house of Bourbon, and was the mother of Henri\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMarguerite held her court in true princely manner in the castle of Pau\r\nor at Nérac, and she loved to surround herself with a circle of men\r\nremarkable for their character and talents, and ladies distinguished\r\nby beauty and accomplishments, which made it rival in brilliance\r\neven that of her brother François. She placed nearest to her person,\r\nunder the character of her _valets-de-chambre_, the principal poets\r\nand _beaux-esprits_ of her time, such as Clement Marot, Bonaventure\r\ndes Periers, Claude Gruget, Antoine du Moulin, and Jean de la Haye,\r\nand admitted them to such a tender familiarity of intercourse, as to\r\nexcite the jealousy of the king her husband, from whose ill-treatment\r\nshe was only protected by her brother's interference. The poets called\r\nher chamber a \"veritable Parnassus.\" Hers was certainly a great\r\nmind, greedy of knowledge, dissatisfied with what was, and eager for\r\nnovelties, and therefore she encouraged all who sought for them. It\r\nwas in this spirit, combined with her earnest love for letters, that\r\nshe threw her protection over both the sceptics and the religious\r\nreformers. At the beginning of the persecutions, as early as 1523,\r\nshe openly declared herself the advocate of the Protestants. When\r\nClement Marot was arrested by order of the Sorbonne and the Inquisitor\r\non the charge of having eaten bacon in Lent, Marguerite caused him\r\nto be liberated from prison, in defiance of his persecutors. Some of\r\nthe purest and ablest of the early French reformers, such as Roussel\r\nand Le Fèvre d'Etaples, and Calvin himself, found a safe asylum from\r\ndanger in her dominions. As might be supposed, the bigoted party were\r\nbitterly incensed against the queen of Navarre, and were not backward\r\nin taking advantage of an opportunity for showing it. A moral treatise,\r\nentitled \"Le Miroir de l'Ame Pécheresse,\" of which Marguerite was the\r\nauthor, was condemned by the Sorbonne in 1533, but the king compelled\r\nthe university, in the person of its rector, Nicolas Cop, to disavow\r\npublicly the censure. This was followed by a still greater act of\r\ninsolence, for, at the instigation of some of the more bigoted papists,\r\nthe scholars of the college of Navarre, in concert with their regents,\r\nperformed a farce in which Marguerite was transformed into a fury of\r\nhell. François I., greatly indignant, sent his archers to arrest the\r\noffenders, who further provoked his anger by resistance, and only\r\nobtained their pardon through the generous intercession of the princess\r\nwhom they had so grossly insulted.\r\n\r\nMarguerite was herself a poetess, and she loved above all things\r\nthose gay, and seldom very delicate, stories, the telling of which\r\nwas at that time one of the favourite amusements of the evening,\r\nand one in which she was known to excel. Her poetical writings were\r\ncollected and printed, under her own authority, in 1547, by her then\r\n_valet-de-chambre_, Jean de la Haye, who dedicated the volume to her\r\ndaughter. They are all graceful, and some of them worthy of the best\r\npoets of her time. The title of this collection was, punning upon\r\nher name, which means a pearl, \"Marguerites de la Marguerite des\r\nprincesses, très illustre reyne de Navarre.\" Marguerite's stories\r\n(_nouvelles_) were more celebrated than her verses, and are said to\r\nhave been committed to writing under her own dictation. All the ladies\r\nof her court possessed copies of them in writing. It is understood to\r\nhave been her intention to form them into ten days' tales, of ten in\r\neach day, so as to resemble the \"Decameron\" of Boccaccio, but only\r\neight days were finished at the time of her death, and the imperfect\r\nwork was published posthumously by her _valet-de-chambre_, Claude\r\nGruget, under the title of \"L'Heptameron, ou Histoire des Amants\r\nFortunés.\" It is by far the best collection of stories of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. They are told charmingly, in language which is a perfect model\r\nof French composition of that age, but they are all tales of gallantry\r\nsuch as could only be repeated in polite society in an age which was\r\nessentially licentious. Queen Marguerite died on the 21st of December,\r\n1549, and was buried in the cathedral of Pau. Her death was a subject\r\nof regret to all that was good and all that was poetic, not only in\r\nFrance, but in Europe, which had been accustomed to look upon her as\r\nthe tenth Muse and the fourth Grace:--\r\n\r\n        _Musarum decima et Charitum quarta, inclyta regum\r\n              Et soror et conjux, Marguaris illa jacet._\r\n\r\nBefore Marguerite's death, her literary circle had been broken up by\r\nthe hatred of religious persecutors. Already, in 1536, the imprudent\r\nboldness of Marot had rendered it impossible to protect him any\r\nlonger, and he had been obliged to retire to a place of concealment,\r\nfrom whence he sometimes paid a stealthy visit to her court. His\r\nplace of _valet-de-chambre_ was given to a man of talents, even more\r\nremarkable, and who shared equally the personal esteem of the queen of\r\nNavarre, Bonaventure des Periers. Marot's successor paid a graceful\r\ncompliment to him in a short poem entitled \"L'Apologie de Marot\r\nabsent,\" published in 1537. The earlier part of the year following\r\nwitnessed the publication of the most remarkable work of Bonaventure\r\ndes Periers, the \"Cymbalum Mundi,\" concerning the real character\r\nof which writers are still divided in opinion. In it Des Periers\r\nintroduced a new form of satire, imitated from the dialogues of Lucian.\r\nThe book consists of four dialogues, written in language which forms a\r\nmodel of French composition, the personages introduced in them intended\r\nevidently to represent living characters, whose names are concealed\r\nin anagrams and other devices, among whom was Clement Marot. It was\r\nthe boldest declaration of scepticism which had yet issued from the\r\nEpicurean school represented by Rabelais. The author sneers at the\r\nRomish church as an imposture, ridicules the Protestants as seekers\r\nafter the philosopher's stone, and shows disrespect to Christianity\r\nitself. Such a book could hardly be published in Paris with impunity,\r\nyet it was printed there, secretly, it is said, by a well-known\r\nbookseller, Jean Morin, in the Rue St. Jacques, and therefore in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the persecuting Sorbonne. Private information\r\nhad been given of the character of this work, possibly by the printer\r\nhimself or by one of his men, and on the 6th of March, 1538, when it\r\nwas on the eve of publication, the whole impression was seized at the\r\nprinter's, and Morin himself was arrested and thrown into prison. He\r\nwas treated rigorously, and is understood to have escaped only by\r\ndisavowing all knowledge of the character of the book, and giving up\r\nthe name of the author. The first edition of the \"Cymbalum Mundi\" was\r\nburnt, and Bonaventure des Periers, alarmed by the personal dangers\r\nin which he was thus involved, retired from the court of the queen of\r\nNavarre, and took refuge in the city of Lyons, where liberal opinions\r\nat that time found a greater degree of tolerance than elsewhere. There\r\nhe printed a second edition of the \"Cymbalum Mundi,\" which also was\r\nburnt, and copies of either edition are now excessively rare.[98]\r\nBonaventure des Periers felt so much the weight of the persecution in\r\nwhich he had now involved himself, that, in the year 1539, as far as\r\ncan be ascertained, he put an end to his own existence. This event cast\r\na gloom over the court of the queen of Navarre, from which it seems\r\nnever to have entirely recovered. The school of scepticism to which Des\r\nPeriers belonged had now fallen into equal discredit with Catholics and\r\nProtestants, and the latter looked upon Marguerite herself, who had\r\nlatterly conformed outwardly with Romanism, as an apostate from their\r\ncause. Henri Estienne, in his \"Apologie pour Herodote,\" speaks of the\r\n\"Cymbalum Mundi\" as an infamous book.\r\n\r\n [98] A cheap and convenient edition of the \"Cymbalum Mundi,\" edited\r\n      by the Bibliophile Jacob (Paul Lacroix), was published in Paris\r\n      in 1841. I may here state that similar editions of the principal\r\n      French satirists of the sixteenth century have been printed\r\n      during the last twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nBonaventure des Periers left behind him another work more amusing to us\r\nat the present day, and more characteristic of the literary tastes of\r\nthe court of Marguerite of Navarre. This is a collection of facetious\r\nstories, which was published several years after the death of its\r\nauthor, under the title of \"Les Contes, ou Les Nouvelles Récréations et\r\nJoyeux Devis de Bonaventure des Periers.\" They have some resemblance\r\nin style to the stories of the Heptameron, but are shorter, and rather\r\nmore facetious, and are characterised by their bitter spirit of satire\r\nagainst the monks and popish clergy. Some of these stories remind us,\r\nin their peculiar character and tone, of the \"Epistolæ Obscurorum\r\nVirorum,\" as, for an example, the following, which is given as an\r\nanecdote of the curé de Brou:--\r\n\r\n     \"This curé had a way of his own to chant the different offices\r\n     of the church, and above all he disliked the way of saying the\r\n     Passion in the manner it was ordinarily said in churches, and he\r\n     chanted it quite differently. For when our Lord said anything to\r\n     the Jews, or to Pilate, he made him talk high and loud, so that\r\n     everybody could hear him, and when it was the Jews or somebody\r\n     else who spoke, he spoke so low that he could hardly be heard\r\n     at all. It happened that a lady of rank and importance, on her\r\n     way to Châteaudun, to keep there the festival of Easter, passed\r\n     through Brou on Good Friday, about ten o'clock in the morning,\r\n     and, wishing to hear service, she went to the church where the\r\n     curé was officiating. When it came to the Passion, he said it\r\n     in his own manner, and made the whole church ring again when\r\n     he said _Quem quæritis_? But when it came to the reply, _Jesum\r\n     Nazarenum_, he spoke as low as he possibly could. And in this\r\n     manner he continued the Passion. The lady, who was very devout,\r\n     and, for a woman, well informed in the holy scriptures, and\r\n     attentive to the ecclesiastical ceremonies, felt scandalised\r\n     at this mode of chanting, and wished she had never entered the\r\n     church. She had a mind to speak to the curé, and tell him what\r\n     she thought of it; and for this purpose sent for him to come to\r\n     her after the service. When he came, she said to him, 'Monsieur\r\n     le Curé, I don't know where you learnt to officiate on a day like\r\n     this, when the people ought to be all humility; but to hear you\r\n     perform the service, is enough to drive away anybody's devotion.'\r\n     'How so, madame?' said the curé. 'How so?' said she, 'you have\r\n     said a Passion contrary to all rules of decency. When our Lord\r\n     speaks, you cry as if you were in the town-hall; and when it is a\r\n     Caiaphas, or Pilate, or the Jews, you speak softly like a young\r\n     bride. Is this becoming in one like you? are you fit to be a curé?\r\n     If you had what you deserve, you would be turned out of your\r\n     benefice, and then you would be made to know your fault!' When the\r\n     curé had very attentively listened to her, he said, 'Is this what\r\n     you had to say to me, madame? By my soul! it is very true, what\r\n     they say; and the truth is, that there are many people who talk of\r\n     things which they do not understand. Madame, I believe that I know\r\n     my office as well as another, and I beg all the world to know that\r\n     God is as well served in this parish according to its condition,\r\n     as in any place within a hundred leagues of it. I know very well\r\n     that the other curés chant the Passion quite differently; I could\r\n     easily chant it like them if I would; but they do not understand\r\n     their business at all. I should like to know if it becomes those\r\n     rogues of Jews to speak as loud as our Lord! No, no, madame; rest\r\n     assured that in my parish it is my will that God be the master,\r\n     and He shall be as long as I live; and let the others do in their\r\n     parishes according to their understanding.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother story, equally worthy of Ulric von Hutten, is satirical enough\r\non priestly pedantry:--\r\n\r\n     \"There was a priest of a village who was as proud as might be,\r\n     because he had seen a little more than his Cato; for he had read\r\n     _De Syntaxi_, and his _Fauste precor gelida_ [the first eclogue\r\n     of Baptista Mantuanus]. And this made him set up his feathers,\r\n     and talk very grand, using words that filled his mouth, in order\r\n     to make people think him a great doctor. Even at confession, he\r\n     made use of terms which astonished the poor people. One day he\r\n     was confessing a poor working man, of whom he asked, 'Here, now,\r\n     my friend, tell me, art thou ambitious?' The poor man said 'No,'\r\n     thinking this was a word which belonged to great lords, and almost\r\n     repented of having come to confess to this priest; for he had\r\n     already heard that he was such a great clerk, and that he spoke\r\n     so grandly, that nobody understood him, which he now knew by this\r\n     word _ambitious_; for although he might have heard it somewhere,\r\n     yet he did not know at all what it was. The priest went on to\r\n     ask 'Art thou not a fornicator?' 'No,' said the labourer, who\r\n     understood as little as before. 'Art thou not a gourmand?' said\r\n     the priest. 'No.' 'Art thou not superbe [_proud_]?' 'No.' 'Art\r\n     thou not iracund?' 'No.' The priest seeing the man answer always\r\n     'No,' was somewhat surprised. 'Art thou not concupiscent?' 'No.'\r\n     'And what art thou, then?' said the priest. 'I am,' said he, 'a\r\n     mason; here is my trowel!'\"\r\n\r\nAt this time \"Pantagruelism\" had mixed itself more or less largely in\r\nall the satirical literature of France. It is very apparent in the\r\nwritings of Bonaventure des Periers, and in a considerable number of\r\nsatirical publications which now issued, many of them anonymously, or\r\nunder the then fashionable form of anagrams, from the press in France.\r\nAmong these writers were a few who, though far inferior to Rabelais,\r\nmay be considered as not unequal to Des Periers himself. One of the\r\nmost remarkable of these was a gentleman of Britany, Noel du Fail, lord\r\nof La Hérissaye, who was, like so many of these satirists, a lawyer,\r\nand who died, apparently at an advanced age, at the end of 1585, or\r\nbeginning of 1586. In his publications, according to the fashion of\r\nthat age, he concealed his name under an anagram, and called himself\r\nLeon Ladulfil (doubling the _l_ in the name Fail). Noel du Fail has\r\nbeen called the ape of Rabelais, though the mere imitation is not very\r\napparent. He published (as far as has been ascertained), in 1548,\r\nhis \"Discours d'aucuns propos ruftiques facétieux, et de singulière\r\nrécréation.\" This was followed immediately by a work entitled\r\n\"Baliverneries, ou Contes Nouveaux d'Eutrapel;\" but his last, and most\r\ncelebrated book, the \"Contes et Discours d'Eutrapel,\" was not printed\r\nuntil 1586, after the death of its author. The writings of Noel du Fail\r\nare full of charming pictures of rural life in the sixteenth century,\r\nand, though sufficiently free, they present less than most similar\r\nbooks of that period of the coarseness of Rabelais. I cannot say the\r\nsame of a book which is much more celebrated than either of these,\r\nand the history of which is still enveloped in obscurity. I mean the\r\n\"Moyen de Parvenir.\" This book, which is full of wit and humour, but\r\nthe licentiousness of which is carried to a degree which renders it\r\nunreadable at the present day, is now ascribed by bibliographers, in\r\nits present form, to Béroalde de Verville, a gentleman of a Protestant\r\nfamily who had embraced Catholicism, and obtained advancements in the\r\nchurch, and it was not printed until 1610, but it is supposed that in\r\nits present form it is only a revision of an earlier composition,\r\nperhaps even an unacknowledged work of Rabelais himself, which had been\r\npreserved in manuscript in Beroald's family.\r\n\r\nPantagruelism, or, if you like, Rabelaism, did not, during the\r\nsixteenth century, make much progress beyond the limits of France.\r\nIn the Teutonic countries of Europe, and in England, the sceptical\r\nsentiment was small in comparison with the religious feeling, and the\r\nonly satirical work at all resembling those we have been describing,\r\nwas the \"Utopia\" of Sir Thomas More, a work comparatively spiritless,\r\nand which produced a very slight sensation. In Spain, the state of\r\nsocial feeling was still less favourable to the writings of Rabelais,\r\nyet he had there a worthy and true representative in the author of\r\nDon Quixote. It was only in the seventeenth century that the works of\r\nRabelais were translated into English; but we must not forget that our\r\nsatirists of the last century, such as Swift and Sterne, derived their\r\ninspiration chiefly from Rabelais, and from the Pantagruelistic writers\r\nof the latter half of the sixteenth century. These latter were most of\r\nthem poor imitators of their original, and, like all poor imitators,\r\npursued to exaggeration his least worthy characteristics. There is\r\nstill some humour in the writings of Tabourot, the sieur des Accords,\r\nespecially in his \"Bigarrures,\" but the later productions, which\r\nappeared under such names as Bruscambille and Tabarin, sink into mere\r\ndull ribaldry.\r\n\r\nThere had arisen, however, by the side of this satire which smelt\r\nsomewhat too much of the tavern, another satire, more serious,\r\nwhich still contained a little of the style of Rabelais. The French\r\nProtestants at first looked upon Rabelais as one of their towers of\r\nstrength, and embraced with gratitude the powerful protection they\r\nreceived from the graceful queen of Navarre; but their gratitude\r\nfailed them, when Marguerite, though she never ceased to give them her\r\nprotection, conformed outwardly, from attachment to her brother, to the\r\nforms of the Catholic faith, and they rejected the school of Rabelais\r\nas a mere school of Atheists. Among them arose another school of\r\nsatire, a sort of branch from the other, which was represented in its\r\ninfancy by the celebrated scholar and printer, Henri Estienne, better\r\nknown among us as Henry Stephens.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable book called an \"Apologie pour Herodote,\" arose out of\r\nan attack upon its writer by the Romanists. Henri Estienne, who was\r\nknown as a staunch Protestant, published, at great expense, an edition\r\nof Herodotus in Greek and Latin, and the zealous Catholics, out of\r\nspite to the editor, decried his author, and spoke of Herodotus as a\r\nmere collector of monstrous and incredible tales. Estienne, in revenge,\r\npublished what, under the form of an apology for Herodotus, was really\r\na violent attack on the Romish church. His argument is that all\r\nhistorians must relate transactions which appear to many incredible,\r\nand that the events of modern times were much more incredible, if\r\nthey were not known to be true, than anything which is recorded by\r\nthe historian of antiquity. After an introductory dissertation on the\r\nlight in which we ought to regard the fable of the Golden Age, and on\r\nthe moral character of the ancient peoples, he goes on to show that\r\ntheir depravity was much less than that of the middle ages and of his\r\nown time, indeed of all periods during which people were governed by\r\nthe Church of Rome. Not only did this dissoluteness of morals pervade\r\nlay society, but the clergy were more vicious even than the people, to\r\nwhom they ought to serve as an example. A large part of the book is\r\nfilled with anecdotes of the immoral lives of the popish clergy of the\r\nsixteenth century, and of their ignorance and bigotry; and he describes\r\nin detail the methods employed by the Romish church to keep the mass\r\nof the people in ignorance, and to repress all attempts at inquiry.\r\nOut of all this, he says, had risen a school of atheists and scoffers,\r\nrepresented by Rabelais and Bonaventure des Periers, both of whom he\r\nmentions by name.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the end of the sixteenth century, the struggle of\r\nparties became more political than religious, but not less bitter than\r\nbefore. The literature of the age of that celebrated \"Ligue,\" which\r\nseemed at one time destined to overthrow the ancient royalty of France,\r\nconsisted chiefly of libellous and abusive pamphlets, but in the midst\r\nof them there appeared a work far superior to any purely political\r\nsatire which had yet been seen, and the fame of which has never passed\r\naway. Its object was to turn to ridicule the meeting of the Estates\r\nof France, convoked by the duke of Mayenne, as leader of the Ligue,\r\nand held at Paris on the 10th of February, 1503. The grand object of\r\nthis meeting was to exclude Henri IV. from the throne; and the Spanish\r\nparty proposed to abolish the Salic law, and proclaim the infanta of\r\nSpain queen of France. The French ligueurs proposed plans hardly less\r\nunpatriotic, and the duke of Mayenne, indignant at the small account\r\nmade of his own personal pretensions, prorogued the meeting, and\r\npersuaded the two parties to hold what proved a fruitless conference at\r\nSuresne. It was the meeting of the Estates in Paris which gave rise to\r\nthat celebrated _Satyre Ménippée_, of which it was said, that it served\r\nthe cause of Henri IV. as much as the battle of Ivry itself.\r\n\r\nThis satire originated among a party of friends, of men distinguished\r\nby learning, wit, and talent, though most of their names are obscure,\r\nwho used to meet in an evening in the hospitable house of one of\r\nthem, Jacques Gillot, on the Quai des Orfèvres in Paris, and there\r\ntalk satirically over the violence and insolence of the ligueurs.\r\nThey all belonged either to the bar or to the university, or to the\r\nchurch. Gillot himself, a Burgundian, born about the year 1560, had\r\nbeen a dean in the church of Langres, and afterwards canon of the\r\nSainte Chapelle in Paris, and was at this time conseiller-clerc to\r\nthe parliament of Paris. In 1589 he was committed to the Bastille,\r\nbut was soon afterwards liberated. Nicolas Rapin, one of his friends,\r\nwas born in 1535, and was said to have been the son of a priest, and\r\ntherefore illegitimate. He was a lawyer, a poet, and a soldier, for he\r\nfought bravely in the ranks of Henri IV. at Ivry, and his devotion to\r\nthat prince was so well known, that he was banished from Paris by the\r\nligueurs, but had returned thither before the meeting of the Estates in\r\n1593. Jean Passerat, born in 1534, was also a poet, and a professor in\r\nthe Collège Royal. Florent Chrestien, born at Orleans in 1540, had been\r\nthe tutor of Henri IV., and was well known as a man of sound learning.\r\nThe most learned of the party was Pierre Pithou, born at Troyes in\r\n1539, who had abjured Calvinism to return to Romanism, and who held\r\na distinguished position at the French bar. The last of this little\r\nparty of men of letters was a canon of Rouen named Pierre le Roy, a\r\npatriotic ecclesiastic, who held the office of almoner to the cardinal\r\nde Bourbon. It was Le Roy who drew up the first sketch of the \"Satyre\r\nMénippée,\" each of the others executed his part in the composition, and\r\nPithou finally revised it. For several years this remarkable satire\r\ncirculated only secretly, and in manuscript, and it was not printed\r\nuntil Henri IV. was established on the throne.\r\n\r\nThe satire opens with an account of the virtues of the \"Catholicon,\"\r\nor nostrum for curing all political diseases, or the _higuiero\r\nd'infierno_, which had been so effective in the hands of the Spaniards,\r\nwho invented it. Some of these are extraordinary enough. If, we are\r\ntold, the lieutenant of Don Philip \"have some of this Catholicon on\r\nhis flags, he will enter without a blow into an enemy's country, and\r\nthey will meet him with crosses and banners, legates and primates; and\r\nthough he ruin, ravage, usurp, massacre, and sack everything, and carry\r\naway, ravish, burn, and reduce everything to a desert, the people of\r\nthe country will say, 'These are our friends, they are good Catholics;\r\nthey do it for our peace, and for our mother holy church.'\" \"If an\r\nindolent king amuse himself with refining this drug in his escurial,\r\nlet him write a word into Flanders to Father Ignatius, sealed with\r\nthe Catholicon, he will find him a man who (_salva conscientia_) will\r\nassassinate his enemy whom he has not been able to conquer by arms in\r\ntwenty years.\" This, of course, is an allusion to the murder of the\r\nprince of Orange. \"If this king proposes to assure his estates to his\r\nchildren after his death, and to invade another's kingdom at little\r\nexpense, let him write a word to Mendoza, his ambassador, or to Father\r\nCommelet (one of the most seditious orators of the Ligue), and if he\r\nwrite with the _higuiero del infierno_, at the bottom of his letter,\r\nthe words _Yo el Rey_, they will furnish him with an apostate monk, who\r\nwill go under a fair semblance, like a Judas, and assassinate in cold\r\nblood a great king of France, his brother-in-law, in the middle of his\r\ncamp, without fear of God or men; they will do more, they will canonise\r\nthe murderer, and place this Judas above St. Peter, and baptise this\r\nprodigious and horrible crime with the name of a providential event,\r\nof which the godfathers will be cardinals, legates, and primates.\" The\r\nallusion here is to the assassination of Henri III. by Jacques Clement.\r\nThese are but a few of the marvellous properties of the political drug,\r\nafter the enumeration of which the report of the meeting of the Estates\r\nis introduced by a burlesque description of the grand procession\r\nwhich preceded it. Then we are introduced to the hall of assembly, and\r\ndifferent subjects pictured on the tapestries which cover its walls,\r\nall having reference to the politics of the Ligue, are described fully.\r\nThen we come to the report of the meeting, and to the speeches of the\r\ndifferent speakers, each of which is a model of satire. It is not known\r\nwhich of the little club of satirists wrote the open speech of the duke\r\nof Mayenne, but that of the Roman legate is known to be the work of\r\nGillot, and that of the cardinal de Pelvé, a masterpiece of Latin in\r\nthe style of the \"Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum,\" was written by Florent\r\nChrestien. Nicolas Rapin composed the \"harangue\" placed in the mouth\r\nof the archbishop of Lyons, as well as that of Rose, the rector of\r\nthe university; and the long speech of Claude d'Aubray was by Pithou.\r\nPasserat composed most of the verses which are scattered through the\r\nbook, and it is understood that Pithou finally revised the whole. This\r\nmock report of the meeting of the Estates closes with a description of\r\na series of political pictures which are arranged on the wall of the\r\nstaircase of the hall.\r\n\r\nThese pictures, as well as those on the tapestries of the hall of\r\nmeeting, are simply so many caricatures, and the same may be said of\r\nanother set of pictures, of which a description is given in one of the\r\nsatirical pieces which followed the \"Satyre Ménippée,\" on the same\r\nside, entitled, \"Histoire des Singeries de la Ligue.\" It was amid\r\nthe political turmoil of the sixteenth century in France that modern\r\npolitical caricature took its rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  POLITICAL CARICATURE IN ITS INFANCY.--THE REVERS DU JEU DES\r\n     SUYSSES.--CARICATURE IN FRANCE.--THE THREE ORDERS.--PERIOD OF THE\r\n     LEAGUE; CARICATURES AGAINST HENRI III.--CARICATURES AGAINST THE\r\n     LEAGUE.--CARICATURE IN FRANCE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.--GENERAL\r\n     GALAS.--THE QUARREL OF AMBASSADORS.--CARICATURE AGAINST LOUIS\r\n     XIV.; WILLIAM OF FÜRSTEMBERG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that political caricature, in the modern\r\nsense of the word, or even personal caricature, was inconsistent with\r\nthe state of things in the middle ages, until the arts of engraving\r\nand printing became sufficiently developed, because it requires the\r\nfacility of quick and extensive circulation. The political or satirical\r\nsong was carried everywhere by the minstrel, but the satirical picture,\r\nrepresented only in some solitary sculpture or illumination, could\r\nhardly be finished before it had become useless even in the small\r\nsphere of its influence, and then remained for ages a strange figure,\r\nwith no meaning that could be understood. No sooner, however, was\r\nthe art of printing introduced, than the importance of political\r\ncaricature was understood and turned to account. We have seen what a\r\npowerful agent it became in the Reformation, which in spirit was no\r\nless political than religious; but even before the great religious\r\nmovement had begun, this agent had been brought into activity. One\r\nof the earliest engravings which can be called a caricature--perhaps\r\nthe oldest of our modern caricatures known--is represented in our\r\ncut No. 171, is no doubt French, and belongs to the year 1499. It is\r\nsufficiently explained by the history of the time.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 171. The Political Game of Cards._]\r\n\r\nAt the date just mentioned, Louis XII. of France, who had been king\r\nless than twelve months, was newly married to Anne of Britany, and\r\nhad resolved upon an expedition into Italy, to unite the crown of\r\nNaples with that of France. Such an expedition affected many political\r\ninterests and Louis had to employ a certain amount of diplomacy with\r\nhis neighbours, several of whom were strongly opposed to his projects\r\nof ambition, and among those who acted most openly were the Swiss,\r\nwho were believed to have been secretly supported by England and the\r\nNetherlands. Louis, however, overcame their opposition, and obtained a\r\nrenewal of the alliance which had expired with his predecessor Charles\r\nVIII. This temporary difficulty with the Swiss is the subject of our\r\ncaricature, the original of which bears the title \"Le Revers du Jeu\r\ndes Suysses\" (the defeat of the game of the Swiss). The princes most\r\ninterested are assembled round a card-table, at which are seated the\r\nking of France to the right, opposite him the Swiss, and in front the\r\ndoge of Venice, who was in alliance with the French against Milan. At\r\nthe moment represented, the king of France is announcing that he has a\r\nflush of cards, the Swiss acknowledges the weakness of his hand, and\r\nthe doge lays down his cards--in fact, Louis XII. has won the game.\r\nBut the point of the caricature lies principally in the group around.\r\nTo the extreme right the king of England, Henry VII., distinguished\r\nby his three armorial lions, and the king of Spain, are engaged in\r\nearnest conversation. Behind the former stands the infanta Margarita,\r\nwho is evidently winking at the Swiss to give him information of the\r\nstate of the cards of his opponents. At her side stands the duke of\r\nWirtemberg, and just before him the pope, the infamous Alexander VI.\r\n(Borgia), who, though in alliance with Louis, is not able, with all his\r\nefforts, to read the king's game, and looks on with evident anxiety.\r\nBehind the doge of Venice stands the Italian refugee, Trivulci, an able\r\nwarrior, devoted to the interests of France; and at the doge's right\r\nhand, the emperor, holding in his hands another pack of cards, and\r\napparently exulting in the belief that he has thrown confusion into\r\nthe king of France's game. In the background to the left are seen the\r\ncount Palatine and the marquis of Montserrat, who also look uncertain\r\nabout the result; and below the former appears the duke of Savoy, who\r\nwas giving assistance to the French designs. The duke of Lorraine is\r\nserving drink to the gamblers, while the duke of Milan, who was at this\r\ntime playing rather a double part, is gathering up the cards which have\r\nfallen to the ground, in order to make a game for himself. Louis XII.\r\ncarried his designs into execution; the duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza,\r\nnick-named the Moor, played his cards badly, lost his duchy, and died\r\nin prison.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 172. The Three Orders of the State._]\r\n\r\nSuch is this earliest of political caricatures--and in this case it\r\nwas purely political--but the question of religion soon began not only\r\nto mix itself up with the political question, but almost to absorb it,\r\nas we have seen in the review of the history of caricature under the\r\nReformation. Before this period, indeed, political caricature was only\r\nan affair between crowned heads, or between kings and their nobles, but\r\nthe religious agitation had originated a vast social movement, which\r\nbrought into play popular feelings and passions: these gave caricature\r\na totally new value. Its power was greatest on the middle and lower\r\nclasses of society, that is, on the people, the _tiers état_, which was\r\nnow thrown prominently forward. The new social theory is proclaimed\r\nin a print, of which a fac-simile will be found in the \"Musée de la\r\nCaricature,\" by E. J. Jaime, and which, from the style and costume,\r\nappears to be German. The three orders, the church, the lord of the\r\nland, and the people, represented respectively by a bishop, a knight,\r\nand a cultivator, stand upon the globe in an honourable equality, each\r\nreceiving direct from heaven the emblems or implements of his duties.\r\nTo the bishop is delivered his bible, to the husbandman his mattock,\r\nand to the knight the sword with which he is to protect and defend the\r\nothers. This print--see cut No. 172--which bears the title, in Latin,\r\n\"Quis te prætulit?\" (Who chose thee?) belongs probably to the earlier\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century. A painting in the Hôtel de Ville of\r\nAix, in Provence, represents the same subject much more satirically,\r\nintending to delineate the three orders as they were, and not as they\r\nought to be. The divine hand is letting down from heaven an immense\r\nframe in the form of a heart, in which is a picture representing a king\r\nkneeling before the cross, intimating that the civil power was to be\r\nsubordinate to the ecclesiastical. The three orders are represented\r\nby a cardinal, a noble, and a peasant, the latter of whom is bending\r\nunder the burthen of the heart, the whole of which is thrown upon his\r\nshoulders, while the cardinal and the noble, the latter dressed in\r\nthe fashionable attire of the court minions of the day, are placing\r\none hand to the heart on each side, in a manner which shows that they\r\nsupport none of the weight.\r\n\r\nAmid the fierce agitation which fell upon France in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, for a while we find but few traces of the employment of\r\ncaricature by either party. The religious reformation there was rather\r\naristocratic than popular, and the reformers sought less to excite\r\nthe feelings of the multitude, which, indeed, went generally in the\r\ncontrary direction. There was, moreover, a character of gloom in the\r\nreligion of Calvin, which contracted strongly with the joyousness of\r\nthat of the followers of Luther; and the factions in France sought to\r\nslaughter, rather than to laugh at, each other. The few caricatures\r\nof this period which are known, are very bitter and coarse. As far as\r\nI am aware, no early Huguenot caricatures are known, but there are a\r\nfew directed against the Huguenots. It was, however, with the rise of\r\nthe Ligue that the taste for political caricature may be said to have\r\ntaken root in France, and in that country it long continued to flourish\r\nmore than anywhere else. The first caricatures of the ligueurs were\r\ndirected against the person of the king, Henri de Valois, and possess\r\na brutality almost beyond description. It was now an object to keep up\r\nthe bitterness of spirit of the fanatical multitude. In one of these\r\ncaricatures a demon is represented waiting on the king to summon him\r\nto a meeting of the \"Estates\" in hell; and in the distance we see\r\nanother demon flying away with him. Another relates to the murder of\r\nthe Guises, in 1588, which the ligueurs professed to ascribe to the\r\ncouncils of M. d'Epernon, one of his favourites, on whom they looked\r\nwith great hatred. It is entitled, \"Soufflement et Conseil diabolique\r\nde d'Epernon à Henri de Valois pour faccager les Catholiques.\" In the\r\nmiddle of the picture stands the king, and beside him D'Epernon, who\r\nis blowing into his ear with a bellows. On the ground before them lie\r\nthe headless corpses of the _deux frères Catholiques_, the duke of\r\nGuise, and his brother the cardinal, while the executioner of royal\r\nvengeance is holding up their heads by the hair. In the distance is\r\nseen the castle of Blois, in which this tragedy took place; and on the\r\nleft of the picture appear the cardinal de Bourbon, the archbishop of\r\nBlois, and other friends of the Guises, expressing their horror at the\r\ndeed. Henri III. was himself murdered in the year following, and the\r\ncaricatures against him became still more brutal during the period in\r\nwhich the ligueurs tried to set up a king of their own in his place. In\r\none caricature, which has more of an emblematical character than most\r\nof the others, he is pictured as \"Henri le Monstrueux;\" and in others,\r\nentitled \"Les Hermaphrodites,\" he is exhibited under forms which point\r\nat the infamous vices with which he was charged.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 173. The Assembly of Apes._]\r\n\r\nThe tide of caricature, however, soon turned in the contrary direction,\r\nand the coarse, unprincipled abuse employed by the ligueurs found a\r\nfavourable contrast in the powerful wit and talent of the satirists\r\nand caricaturists who now took up pen and pencil in the cause of\r\nHenri IV. The former was, on the whole, the more formidable weapon,\r\nbut the latter represented to some eyes more vividly in picture what\r\nhad already been done in type. This was the case on both sides; the\r\ncaricature last mentioned was founded upon a very libellous satirical\r\npamphlet against Henri III., entitled \"L'Isle des Hermaphrodites.\" It\r\nis the case also with the first caricatures against the ligueurs, which\r\nI have to mention. The Estates held in Paris by the duke of Mayenne\r\nand the ligueurs for the purpose of electing a new king in opposition\r\nto Henri of Navarre, were made the subject of the celebrated \"Satyre\r\nMénippée,\" in which the proceedings of these Estates were turned to\r\nridicule in the most admirable manner. Four large editions were sold\r\nin less than as many months. Several caricatures arose out of or\r\naccompanied this remarkable book. One of these is a rather large print,\r\nentitled \"La Singerie des Estats de la Ligue, l'an 1593,\" in which the\r\nmembers of the Estates and the ligueurs are pictured with the heads\r\nof monkeys. The central part represents the meeting of the Estates,\r\nat which the lieutenant-general of the kingdom, the duke of Mayenne,\r\nseated on the throne, presides. Above him is suspended a large portrait\r\nof the infanta of Spain, _L'Espousée de la Ligue_, as she is called\r\nin the satire, ready to marry any one whom the Estates shall declare\r\nking of France. In chairs, on each side of Mayenne, are the two \"ladies\r\nof honour\" of the said future spouse. To the left are seated in a row\r\nthe celebrated council of sixteen (_les seize_), reduced at this time\r\nto twelve, because the duke of Mayenne, to check their turbulence,\r\nhad caused four of them to be hanged. They wear the favours of the\r\nfuture spouse. Opposite to them are the representatives of the three\r\norders, all, we are told, devoted to the service of \"the said lady.\"\r\nBefore the throne are the two musicians of the Ligue, one described as\r\nPhelipottin, the blind performer on the viel, or hurdy-gurdy, to the\r\nLigue, and his subordinate, the player on the triangle, \"kept at the\r\nexpense of the future spouse.\" These were to entertain the assembly\r\nduring the pauses between the orations of the various speakers. All\r\nthis is a satire on the efforts of the king of Spain to establish a\r\nmonarch of his own choice. On the bench behind the musicians sit the\r\ndeputies from Lyons, Poitiers, Orleans, and Rheims, cities where the\r\ninfluence of the Ligue was strong, discussing the question as to who\r\nshould be king. Thus much of this picture is represented in our cut\r\nNo. 173. There are other groups of figures in the representation of\r\nthe assembly of the Estates; and there are two side compartments--that\r\non the left representing a forge, on which the fragments of a broken\r\nking are laid to be refounded, and a multitude of apes, with hammers\r\nand an anvil, ready to work him into a new king; the other side of\r\nthe picture represents the circumstances of a then well-known act of\r\ntyranny perpetrated by the Estates of the Ligue. Another large and\r\nwell-executed engraving, published at Paris in 1594, immediately after\r\nHenri IV. had obtained possession of his capital, also represents the\r\ngrand procession of the Ligue as described at the commencement of the\r\n\"Satyre Ménippée,\" and was intended to hold up to ridicule the warlike\r\ntemper of the French Catholic clergy. It is entitled, \"La Procession de\r\nla Ligue.\"\r\n\r\nHenri's triumph over the Ligue was made the subject of a series of\r\nthree caricatures, or perhaps, more correctly, of a caricature in three\r\ndivisions. The first is entitled the \"Naissance de la Ligue,\" and\r\nrepresents it under the form of a monster with three heads, severally\r\nthose of a wolf, a fox, and a serpent, issuing from hell-mouth. Under\r\nit are the following lines:--\r\n\r\n        _L'enfer, pour asservir soubs ses loix tout le monde,\r\n        Vomit ce monstre hideux, fait d'un loup ravisseur,\r\n        D'un renard enveilly, et d'un serpent immonde,\r\n        Affublé d'un manteau propre à toute couleur._\r\n\r\nThe second division, the \"Declin de la Ligue,\" representing its\r\ndownfall, is copied in our cut No. 174. Henri of Navarre, in the form\r\nof a lion, has pounced fiercely upon it, and not too soon, for it had\r\nalready seized the crown and sceptre. In the distance, the sun of\r\nnational prosperity is seen rising over the country. The third picture,\r\nthe \"Effets de la Ligue,\" represents the destruction of the kingdom and\r\nthe slaughter of the people, of which the Ligue had been the cause.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 174. The Destruction of the Ligue._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 175. General Galas._]\r\n\r\nThe caricatures in France became more numerous during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, but they are either so elaborate or so obscure, that each\r\nrequires almost a dissertation to explain it, and they often relate to\r\nquestions or events which have little interest for us at the present\r\nday. Several rather spirited ones appeared at the time of the disgrace\r\nof the mareschal d'Ancre and his wife; and the inglorious war with\r\nthe Netherlands, in 1635, furnished the occasion for others, for\r\nthe French, as usual, could make merry in their reverses as well as\r\nin their successes. The imperialist general Galas inflicted serious\r\ndefeat on the French armies, and compelled them to a very disastrous\r\nretreat from the countries they had invaded, and they tried to amuse\r\nthemselves at the expense of their conqueror. Galas was rather\r\nremarkable for obesity, and the French caricaturists of the day made\r\nthis circumstance a subject for their satire. Our cut No. 175 is copied\r\nfrom a print in which the magnitude of the stomach of General Galas\r\nis certainly somewhat exaggerated. He is represented, not apparently\r\nwith any good reason, as puffed up with his own importance, which is\r\nevaporating in smoke; and along with the smoke thus issuing from his\r\nmouth, he is made to proclaim his greatness in the following rather\r\ndoggrel verses:--\r\n\r\n        _Je suis ce grand Galas, autrefois dans l'armée\r\n        La gloire de l'Espagne et de mes compagnons;\r\n        Maintenant je ne suis qu'un corps plein de fumée,\r\n        Pour avoir trop mangé de raves et d'oignons.\r\n        Gargantua jamais n'eut une telle panse, &c._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 176. Batteville Humiliated._]\r\n\r\nCaricatures in France began to be tolerably abundant during the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century, but under the crushing tyranny of Louis\r\nXIV., the freedom of the press, in all its forms, ceased to exist, and\r\ncaricatures relating to France, unless they came from the court party,\r\nhad to be published in other countries, especially in Holland. It will\r\nbe sufficient to give two examples from the reign of Louis XIV. In the\r\nyear 1661, a dispute arose in London between the ambassador of France,\r\nM. D'Estrades, and the Spanish ambassador, the baron de Batteville,\r\non the question of precedence, which was carried so far as to give\r\nrise to a tumult in the streets of the English capital. At this very\r\nmoment, a new Spanish ambassador, the marquis de Fuentes, was on his\r\nway to Paris, but Louis, indignant at Batteville's behaviour in London,\r\nsent orders to stop Fuentes on the frontier, and forbid his further\r\nadvance into his kingdom. The king of Spain disavowed the act of his\r\nambassador in England, who was recalled, and Fuentes received orders\r\nto make an apology to king Louis. This event was made the subject of\r\na rather boasting caricature, the greater portion of which is given in\r\nour cut No. 176. It is entitled \"Batteville vient adorer le Soliel\"\r\n(Batteville comes to worship the sun). In the original the sun is seen\r\nshining in the upper corner of the picture to the right, and presenting\r\nthe juvenile face of Louis XIV., but the caricaturist appears to have\r\nsubstituted Batteville in the place of Fuentes. Beneath the whole are\r\nthe following boastful lines:--\r\n\r\n        _On ne va plus à Rome, on vient de Rome en France,\r\n        Mériter le pardon de quelque grande offence.\r\n        L'Italie tout entière est soumise à ces loix;\r\n        Un Espagnol s'oppose à ce droit de nos rois.\r\n        Mais un Français puissant joua des bastonnades,\r\n        Et punit l'insolent de ses rodomontades._\r\n\r\nFrom this time there sprung up many caricatures against the Spaniards;\r\nbut the most ferocious caricature, or rather book of caricatures, of\r\nthe reign of Louis XIV., came from without, and was directed against\r\nthe king and his ministers and courtiers. The revocation of the edict\r\nof Nantes took place in October, 1685, and was preceded and followed\r\nby frightful persecutions of the Protestants, which drove away in\r\nthousands the earnest, intelligent, and industrious part of the\r\npopulation of France. They carried with them a deep hatred to their\r\noppressors, and sought refuge especially in the countries most hostile\r\nto Louis XIV.--England and Holland. The latter country, where they\r\nthen enjoyed the greatest freedom of action, soon sent forth numerous\r\nsatirical books and prints against the French king and his ministers,\r\nof which the book just alluded to was one of the most remarkable. It\r\nis entitled \"Les Heros de la Ligue, ou la Procession Monacale conduite\r\npar Louis XIV. pour la Conversion des Protestans de son Royaume,\" and\r\nconsists of a series of twenty-four most grotesque faces, intended to\r\nrepresent the ministers and courtiers of the \"grand roi\" most odious\r\nto the Calvinists. It must have provoked their wrath exceedingly. I\r\ngive one example, and as it is difficult to select, I take the first in\r\nthe list, which represents William of Fürstemberg, one of the German\r\nprinces devoted to Louis XIV., who, by his intrigues, had forced him\r\ninto the archbishopric of Cologne, by which he became an elector\r\nof the empire. For many reasons William of Fürstemberg was hated by\r\nthe French Protestants, but it is not quite clear why he is here\r\nrepresented in the character of one of the low merchants of the Halles.\r\nOver the picture, in the original, we read, _Guillaume de Furstemberg,\r\ncrie, ite, missa est_, and beneath are the four lines:--\r\n\r\n        _J'ay quitté mon pais pour servir à la France,\r\n        Soit par ma trahison, soit par ma lacheté;\r\n        J'ay troublé les états par ma méchanceté,\r\n              Une abbaye est ma recompense._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 177. William of Fürstemberg._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  EARLY POLITICAL CARICATURE IN ENGLAND.--THE SATIRICAL WRITINGS\r\n     AND PICTURES OF THE COMMONWEALTH PERIOD.--SATIRES AGAINST\r\n     THE BISHOPS; BISHOP WILLIAMS.--CARICATURES ON THE CAVALIERS;\r\n     SIR JOHN SUCKLING.--THE ROARING BOYS; VIOLENCE OF THE\r\n     ROYALIST SOLDIERS.--CONTEST BETWEEN THE PRESBYTERIANS AND\r\n     INDEPENDENTS.--GRINDING THE KING'S NOSE.--PLAYING-CARDS USED AS\r\n     THE MEDIUM FOR CARICATURE; HASELRIGGE AND LAMBERT.--SHROVETIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century caricature can hardly be said to have\r\nexisted in England, and it did not come much into fashion, until the\r\napproach of the great struggle which convulsed our country in the\r\ncentury following. The popular reformers have always been the first to\r\nappreciate the value of pictorial satire as an offensive weapon. Such\r\nwas the case with the German reformers in the age of Luther; as it was\r\nagain with the English reformers in the days of Charles I., a period\r\nwhich we may justly consider as that of the birth of English political\r\ncaricature. From 1640 to 1661 the press launched forth an absolute\r\ndeluge of political pamphlets, many of which were of a satirical\r\ncharacter, scurrilous in form and language, and, on whatever side\r\nthey were written, very unscrupulous in regard to the truth of their\r\nstatements. Among them appeared a not unfrequent engraving, seldom\r\nwell executed, whether on copper or wood, but displaying a coarse and\r\npungent wit that must have told with great effect on those for whom it\r\nwas intended. The first objects of attack in these caricatures were\r\nthe Episcopalian party in the church and the profaneness and insolence\r\nof the cavaliers. The Puritans or Presbyterians who took the lead\r\nin, and at first directed, the great political movement, looked upon\r\nEpiscopalianism as differing in little from popery, and, at all events,\r\nas leading direct to it. Arminianism was with them only another name\r\nfor the same thing, and was equally detested. In a caricature published\r\nin 1641, Arminius is represented supported on one side by Heresy,\r\nwearing the triple crown, while on the other side Truth is turning away\r\nfrom him, and carrying with her the Bible. It was the indiscreet zeal\r\nof archbishop Laud which led to the triumph of the Puritan party, and\r\nthe downfall of the episcopal church government, and Laud became the\r\nbutt for attacks of all descriptions, in pamphlets, songs and satirical\r\nprints, the latter usually figuring in the titles of the pamphlets.\r\nLaud was especially obnoxious to the Puritans for the bitterness with\r\nwhich he had persecuted them.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Laud was committed to the Tower, an event which was hailed\r\nas the first grand step towards the overthrow of the bishops. As an\r\nexample of the feeling of exultation displayed on this occasion by his\r\nenemies, we may quote a few lines from a satirical song, published in\r\n1641, and entitled \"The Organs Eccho. To the Tune of the Cathedrall\r\nService.\" It is a general attack on the prelacy, and opens with a cry\r\nof triumph over the fall of William Laud, of whom the song says--\r\n\r\n          _As he was in his braverie,\r\n          And thought to bring us all in slaverie,\r\n          The parliament found out his knaverie;\r\n                    And so fell William.\r\n                    Alas! poore William!_\r\n\r\n          _His pope-like domineering,\r\n          And some other tricks appearing,\r\n          Provok'd Sir Edward Deering\r\n                    To blame the old prelate.\r\n                    Alas! poore prelate!_\r\n\r\n          _Some say he was in hope\r\n          To bring England againe to th' pope;\r\n          But now he is in danger of an axe or a rope.\r\n                    Farewell, old Canterbury.\r\n                    Alas! poore Canterbury!_\r\n\r\nWren, bishop of Ely, was another of the more obnoxious of the prelates,\r\nand there was hardly less joy among the popular party when he was\r\ncommitted to the Tower in the course of the year 1641. Another song,\r\nin verse similar to the last, contains a general review of the demerits\r\nof the members of the prelacy, under the title of \"The Bishops Last\r\nGood-night.\" At the head of the broadside on which it is printed stand\r\ntwo satirical woodcuts, but it must be confessed that the words of the\r\nsong are better than the engraving. The bishop of Ely, we are told, had\r\njust gone to join his friend Laud in the Tower--\r\n\r\n          _Ely, thou hast alway to thy power\r\n          Left the church naked in a storme and showre,\r\n          And now for 't thou must to thy old friend i' th' Tower.\r\n                    To the Tower must Ely;\r\n                    Come away, Ely._\r\n\r\nA third obnoxious prelate was bishop Williams. Williams was a Welshman\r\nwho had been high in favour with James I., but he had given offence\r\nto the government of Charles I., and been imprisoned in the Tower\r\nduring the earlier part of that king's reign. He was released by the\r\nparliament in 1640, and so far regained the favour of king Charles,\r\nthat he was raised to the archbishopric of York in the year following.\r\nWhen the civil war began, he retired into Wales, and garrisoned Conway\r\nfor the king. Williams's warlike behaviour was the source of much mirth\r\namong the Roundheads. In 1642 was published a large caricature on the\r\nthree classes to whom the parliamentarians were especially hostile--the\r\nroyalist judges, the prelates, and the ruffling cavaliers; represented\r\nhere, as we are told in writing in the copy among the king's pamphlets,\r\nby judge Mallet, bishop Williams, and colonel Lunsford. These three\r\nfigures are placed in as many compartments with doggrel verses under\r\neach. That of bishop Williams is copied in our cut No. 178. The bishop\r\nis armed cap-à-pie, and in the distance behind him are seen on one\r\nside his cathedral church, and on the other his war-horse. The verses\r\nbeneath it contain an allusion to this prelate's Welsh extraction in\r\nthe orthography of some of the words:--\r\n\r\n          _Oh, sir, I'me ready, did you never heere\r\n          How forward I have byn t'is many a yeare,\r\n          T'oppose the practice dat is now on foote,\r\n          Which plucks my brethren up both pranch and roote?\r\n          My posture and my hart toth well agree\r\n          To fight; now plud is up: come, follow mee._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 178. The Church Militant._]\r\n\r\nThe country had now begun to experience the miseries of war, and to\r\nsmart under them; and the cavaliers were especially reproached for the\r\ncruelty with which they plundered and ill-treated people whenever they\r\ngained the mastery. Colonel Lunsford was especially notorious for the\r\nbarbarities committed by himself and his men--to such a degree that he\r\nwas popularly accused of eating children, a charge which is frequently\r\nalluded to in the popular songs of the time. Thus one of these songs\r\ncouples him with two other obnoxious royalists:--\r\n\r\n          _From Fielding, and from Vavasour,\r\n              Both ill-affected men,\r\n          From Lunsford eke deliver us,\r\n              Who eateth up children._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 179. The Sucklington Faction._]\r\n\r\nIn the third compartment of the caricature just mentioned, we see in\r\nthe background of the picture, behind colonel Lunsford, his soldiers\r\noccupied in burning towns, and massacring women and children. The model\r\nof the gay cavalier of the earlier period of this great revolution,\r\nbefore the war had broken out in its intensity, was the courtly Sir\r\nJohn Suckling, the poet of the drawing-room and tavern, the admired\r\nof \"roaring boys,\" and the hated of rigid Puritans. Sir John outdid\r\nhis companions in extravagance in everything which was fashionable,\r\nand the display of his zeal in the cause of royalty was not calculated\r\nto conciliate the reformers. When the king led an army against the\r\nScottish Covenanters in 1639, Suckling raised a troop of a hundred\r\nhorse at his own expense; but they gained more reputation by their\r\nextraordinary dress than by their courage, and the whole affair was\r\nmade a subject of ridicule. From this time the name of Suckling became\r\nidentified with that gay and profligate class who, disgusted by the\r\noutward show of sanctity which the Puritans affected, rushed into\r\nthe other extreme, and became notorious for their profaneness, their\r\nlibertinism, and their indulgence in vice, which threw a certain degree\r\nof discredit upon the royalist party. There is a large broadside\r\namong the King's Pamphlets in the British Museum, entitled, \"The\r\nSucklington Faction; or (Sucklings) Roaring Boys.\" It is one of those\r\nsatirical compositions which were then fashionable under the title\r\nof \"Characters,\" and is illustrated by an engraving, from which our\r\ncut No. 179 is copied. This engraving, which from its superior style\r\nis perhaps the work of a foreign artist, represents the interior of\r\na chamber, in which two of the Roaring Boys are engaged in drinking\r\nand smoking, and forms a curious picture of contemporary manners.\r\nUnderneath the engraving we read the following lines:--\r\n\r\n          _Much meate doth gluttony produce,\r\n              And makes a man a swine;\r\n          But hee's a temperate man indeed\r\n              That with a leafe can dine._\r\n\r\n          _Hee needes no napkin for his handes,\r\n              His fingers for to wipe;\r\n          He hath his kitchin in a box,\r\n              His roast meate in a pipe._\r\n\r\nWhen the war spread itself over the country, many of these Roaring\r\nBoys became soldiers, and disgraced the profession by rapacity and\r\ncruelty. The pamphlets of the parliamentarians abound with complaints\r\nof the outrages perpetrated by the Cavaliers, and the evil appears to\r\nhave been increased by the ill-conduct of the auxiliaries brought over\r\nfrom Ireland to serve the king, who were especially objects of hatred\r\nto the Puritans. A broadside among the king's pamphlets is adorned\r\nby a satirical picture of \"The English Irish Souldier, with his new\r\ndiscipline, new armes, old stomacke, and new taken pillage; who had\r\nrather eat than fight.\" It was published in 1642. The English Irish\r\nsoldier is, as may be supposed, heavily laden with plunder. In 1646\r\nappeared another caricature, which is copied in our cut No. 180. It\r\nrepresents \"England's Wolfe with Eagles clawes: the cruell impieties\r\nof bloud-thirsty royalists and blasphemous anti-parliamentarians,\r\nunder the command of that inhumane prince Rupert, Digby, and the rest,\r\nwherein the barbarous crueltie of our civill uncivill warres is briefly\r\ndiscovered.\" England's wolf, as will be seen, is dressed in the high\r\nfashion of the gay courtiers of the time.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 180. \"England's Wolf.\"_]\r\n\r\nA few large caricatures, embodying satire of a more comprehensive\r\ndescription, appeared from time to time, during this troubled age. Such\r\nis a large emblematical picture, published on the 9th of November,\r\n1642, and entitled \"Heraclitus' Dream,\" for the scene is supposed to\r\nbe manifested to the philosopher in a vision. In the middle of the\r\npicture the sheep are seen shearing their shepherd; while one cuts his\r\nhair, another treats his beard in the same manner. Under the picture we\r\nread the couplet--\r\n\r\n        _The flocke that was wont to be shorne by the herd,\r\n        Now polleth the shepherd in spight of his beard_.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 181. Folly Uppermost._]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, 1647, a caricature appeared under the title\r\n\"An Embleme of the Times.\" On one side War, represented as a giant in\r\narmour, is seen standing upon a heap of dead and mutilated bodies,\r\nwhile Hypocrisy, in the form of a woman with two faces, is flying\r\ntowards a distant city. \"Libertines,\" \"anti-sabbatarians,\" and others,\r\nare hastening in the same direction; and the angel of pestilence,\r\nhovering over the city, is ready to pounce upon it.\r\n\r\nThe party of the parliament was now triumphant, and the question of\r\nreligion again became the subject of dispute. The Presbyterians had\r\nbeen establishing a sort of tyranny over men's minds, and sought to\r\nproscribe all other sects, till their intolerance gradually raised up\r\na strong and general feeling of resistance. Since 1643 a brisk war of\r\npolitical pamphlets had been carried on between the Presbyterians and\r\ntheir opponents, when, in 1647, the Independents, whose cause had been\r\nespoused by the army, gained the mastery. \"Sir John Presbyter\" or to\r\nuse the more familiar phrase, \"Jack Presbyter,\" furnished a subject\r\nfor frequent satire, and the Presbyterians were not slow in returning\r\nthe blow. In the collection in the British Museum we find a caricature\r\nwhich must have come from the Presbyterian party, entitled \"Reall\r\nPersecution, or the Foundation of a general Toleration, displaied\r\nand portrayed by a proper emblem, and adorned with the same flowers\r\nwherewith the scoffers of this last age have strowed their libellous\r\npamphlets.\" The group which occupies the middle part of this broadside,\r\nis copied in our cut No. 181. It has its separate title, \"The Picture\r\nof an English Persecutor, or a foole-ridden ante-Presbeterian sectary.\"\r\n(I give the spelling as in the original.) Folly is riding on the\r\nsectarian, whom he holds with a bridle, the sectarian having the ears\r\nof an ass. The following homely rhymes are placed in the mouth of\r\nFolly,--\r\n\r\n          _Behould my habit, like my witt,\r\n          Equalls his on whom sitt._\r\n\r\nAnti-Presbyterian is, as will be seen, dressed in the height of the\r\nfashion, and says--\r\n\r\n          _My cursed speeches against Presbetry\r\n          Declares unto the world my foolery._\r\n\r\nThe mortification of the Presbyterians led in Scotland to the\r\nproclamation of Charles II. as king, and to the ill-fated expedition\r\nwhich ended in the battle of Worcester in 1651, when satirical\r\npamphlets, ballads, and caricatures against the Scottish Presbyterians\r\nbecame for a while very popular. One of the best of the latter\r\nis represented in our cut No. 182. Its object is to ridicule the\r\nconditions which the Presbyterians exacted from the young prince\r\nbefore they offered him the crown. It is printed in the middle of the\r\nbroadside, in prose, published on the 14th of July, 1651, with the\r\ngeneral title, \"Old Sayings and Predictions verified and fulfilled,\r\ntouching the young King of Scotland and his gude subjects.\" The\r\npicture has its separate title, \"The Scots holding their young kinges\r\nnose to the grinstone.\" followed by the lines--\r\n\r\n        _Come to the grinstone, Charles, 'tis now to late\r\n        To recolect, 'tis presbiterian fate,\r\n        You covinant pretenders, must I bee\r\n        The subject of youer tradgie-comedie?_\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 182. Conditions of Royalty._]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the picture represents Presbyterianism--Jack\r\nPresbyter--holding the young king's nose to the grindstone, which is\r\nturned by the Scots, personified as Jockey. The following lines are put\r\ninto the mouths of the three actors in this scene:--\r\n\r\n  _Jockey._--I, Jockey, turne the stone of all your plots,\r\n                  For none turnes faster than the turne-coat Scots.\r\n\r\n  _Presbyter._--We for our ends did make thee king, be sure,\r\n                     Not to rule us, we will not that endure.\r\n\r\n  _King._--You deep dissemblers, I kow what you doe,\r\n                And, for revenges sake, I will dissemble too.\r\n\r\nCharles's defeat and flight from Worcester furnished materials for a\r\nmuch more elaborate caricature than most of the similar productions\r\nof this period, and of a somewhat singular design. It was published\r\non the 6th of November, 1651, and bears the title \"A Mad Designe; or\r\na Description of the king of Scots marching in his disguise, after\r\nthe Rout at Worcester.\" A long, and not unnecessary, explanation of\r\nthe several groups forming this picture, enables us to understand it.\r\nOn the left Charles is seated on the globe \"in a melancholy posture.\"\r\nA little to the right, and nearly in front, the bishop of Clogher is\r\nperforming mass, at which lords Ormond and Inchquin, in the shapes of\r\nstrange animals, hold torches, and the lord Taaf, in the form of a\r\nmonkey, holds up the bishop's train. The Scottish army is seen marching\r\nup, consisting, according to the description, of papists, prelatical\r\nmalignants, Presbyterians, and old cavaliers; the latter of whom are\r\nrepresented by the \"fooles head upon a pole in the rear.\" The next\r\ngroup consists of two monkeys, one with a fiddle, the other carrying\r\na long staff with a torch at the end, concerning which we learn that\r\n\"The two ridiculous anticks, one with a fiddle, and the other with\r\na torch, set forth the ridiculousness of their condition when they\r\nmarched into England, carried up with high thoughts, yet altogether\r\nin the darke, having onely a fooles bawble to be their light to walke\r\nby, mirth of their own whimsies to keep up their spirits, and a\r\nsheathed sword to truste in.\" Next come a troop of women, children,\r\nand papists, lamenting over their defeat. Two monkeys on foot, and one\r\non horseback, follow, the latter riding with his face turned to the\r\nhorse's tail, and carrying in his hand a spit with provisions on it.\r\nIt is explained as \"The Scots Kings flight from Worcester, represented\r\nby the foole on horseback, riding backward, turning his face every way\r\nin feares, ushered by duke Hambleton and the lord Wilmot.\" Lastly,\r\na crowd of women with flags bring up the rear. It cannot be said\r\nthat the wit displayed in this satire is of the very highest order.\r\n\r\nAfter this period we meet with comparatively few caricatures until the\r\ndeath of Cromwell, and the eve of the Restoration, when there came\r\na new and fierce struggle of political parties. The Dutch were the\r\nsubject of some satirical prints and pamphlets in 1652; and we find a\r\nsmall number of caricatures on the social evils, such as drunkenness\r\nand gluttony, and on one or two subjects of minor agitation. With the\r\nclose of the Commonwealth a new form of caricature came in. Playing\r\ncards had, during this seventeenth century, been employed for various\r\npurposes which were quite alien to their original character. In France\r\nthey were made the means of conveying instruction to children. In\r\nEngland, at the time of which we are speaking, they were adopted as\r\nthe medium for spreading political caricature. The earliest of these\r\npacks of cards known is one which appears to have been published at the\r\nvery moment of the restoration of Charles II., and which was, perhaps,\r\nengraved in Holland. It contains a series of caricatures on the\r\nprincipal acts of the Commonwealth, and on the parliamentary leaders.\r\nAmong other cards of a similar character which have been preserved is\r\na pack relating to the popish plot, another relating to the Rye House\r\nconspiracy, one on the Mississippi scheme, published in Holland, and\r\none on the South Sea bubble.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 183. Arthur Haselrigg._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 184. General Lambert_.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest of these packs of satirical cards, that on the\r\nCommonwealth, belonged a few years ago to a lady of the name of Prest,\r\nand is very fully described in a paper by Mr. Pettigrew, printed in\r\nthe \"Journal of the British Archæological Association.\" Each of the\r\nfifty-two cards presents a picture with a satirical title. Thus the\r\nace of diamonds represents \"The High Court of Justice, or Oliver's\r\nSlaughter House.\" The eight of diamonds is represented in our cut No.\r\n183; its subject is \"Don Haselrigg, Knight of the Codled Braine.\" It\r\nis hardly necesiary to say that Sir Arthur Haselrigg acted a very\r\nprominent and remarkable part during the whole of the Commonwealth\r\nperiod, and that his manners were impetuous and authoritative, which\r\nwas probably the meaning of the epithet here given to him. The card\r\nof the king of diamonds represents rather unequivocally the subject\r\nindicated by its title, \"Sir H. Mildmay solicits a citizen's wife, for\r\nwhich his owne corrects him.\" It is an allusion to one of the petty\r\nscandals of the republican period. The eight of hearts is a satire on\r\nmajor-general Lambert. This able and distinguished man was remarkably\r\nfond of flowers, took great pleasure in cultivating them, and was\r\nskilful in drawing them, which was one of his favourite amusements.\r\nHe withdrew to Amsterdam during the Protectorate, and there gave\r\nfull indulgence to this love of flowers, and I need hardly say that\r\nit was the age of the great tulip mania in Holland. When, after the\r\nRestoration, he was involved in the fate of the regicides, but had\r\nhis sentence commuted for thirty years of imprisonment, he alleviated\r\nthe dulness of his long confinement in the isle of Guernsey by the\r\nsame amusement. In the card we have engraved, Lambert is represented\r\nin his garden, holding a large tulip in his hand; and it is no doubt\r\nin allusion to this innocent taste that he is here entitled \"Lambert,\r\nKnight of the Golden Tulip.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 185. Shrovetide._]\r\n\r\nThe Restoration furnished better songs than prints, and many years\r\npassed before any caricatures worthy of notice appeared in England.\r\nEven burlesque subjects of any merit occur but rarely, and I hardly\r\nknow of one which is worth describing here. Among the best of those I\r\nhave met with, is a pair of plates, published in 1660, representing\r\nLent and Shrovetide, and these, I believe, are copied or imitated from\r\nforeign prints. Lent is come as a thin miserable-looking knight-errant,\r\nappropriately armed and mounted, ready to give battle to Shrovetide,\r\nwhose good living is pernicious to the whole community, and he abuses\r\nhis opponent in good round terms. In the companion print, of which our\r\ncut No. 185 is a copy, Shrovetide appears as a jolly champion, quite\r\nready to meet his enemy. He is best described in the following lines,\r\nextracted from the verses which accompany the prints:--\r\n\r\n          _Fatt Shrovetyde, mounted on a good fatt oxe,\r\n          Supposd that Lent was mad, or caught a foxe,[99]\r\n          Armed cap-a-pea from head unto the heel,\r\n          A spit his long sword, somewhat worse than steale,\r\n          (Sheath'd in a fatt pigge and a peece of porke),\r\n          His bottles fild with wine, well stopt with corke;\r\n          The two plump capons fluttering at his crupper;\r\n          And 's shoulders lac'd with sawsages for supper;\r\n          The gridir'n (like a well strung instrument)\r\n          Hung at his backe, and for the turnament\r\n          His helmet is a brasse pott, and his flagge\r\n          A cookes foule apron, which the wind doth wagg,\r\n          Fixd to a broome: thus bravely he did ride,\r\n          And boldly to his foe he thus replied._\r\n\r\n [99] _i.e._, was drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  ENGLISH COMEDY.--BEN JONSON.--THE OTHER WRITERS OF HIS\r\n     SCHOOL.--INTERRUPTION OF DRAMATIC PERFORMANCES.--COMEDY AFTER\r\n     THE RESTORATION.--THE HOWARDS BROTHERS; THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM;\r\n     THE REHEARSAL.--WRITERS OF COMEDY IN THE LATTER PART OF\r\n     THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.--INDECENCY OF THE STAGE.--COLLEY\r\n     CIBBER.--FOOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England, as in Athens of old, perfect comedy arose gradually out\r\nof the personalities of the rude dramatic attempts of an earlier\r\nperiod. Such productions as Ralph Roister Doister and Gammer Gurton's\r\nNeedle were mere imperfect attempts at, we may perhaps rather say\r\nfeelers towards, comedy itself--that drama, the object of which was to\r\ncaricature, and thus to dissect and apply correctives to, the vices\r\nand weaknesses of contemporary society. The genius of Shakespeare was\r\nfar too exquisitely poetical to qualify him for a task like this; it\r\nwanted some one who could use the lancet and scalpel skilfully, but\r\nsoberly, and who was not liable to be led astray by too much vigour of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nSuch a one was Ben Jonson, whom we may rightly consider as the father\r\nof English comedy. \"Bartholomew Fair,\" first performed at the Hope\r\nTheatre, on Bankside, London, on the 31st of October, 1614, is the\r\nmost perfect and most remarkable example of the truly English comedy,\r\nremarkable, among many other things, for the extraordinary number of\r\ncharacters who were brought upon the stage in one piece, and who are\r\nall at the same time grouped and individualised with a skill that\r\nreminds us of the pictorial triumphs of a Callot or a Hogarth. London\r\nlife is placed before us in all its more popular forms in one grand\r\ntableau, the one in which it would show itself in its more grotesque\r\nattitudes; the London citizen, his vain or easy wife, sharpers of\r\nevery description, and their victims no less varied in character,\r\nthe petty city officers, all come in for their share of satire. The\r\ndifferent groups are distributed so naturally, that it is difficult\r\nto say who is the principal character of the piece--and who ever was\r\nthe principal character in Bartholomew Fair? Perhaps the character of\r\nCokes, the young booby squire from Harrow--for in those times even\r\nso near London as Harrow, a young squire was considered to be in all\r\nprobability but a young country booby--strikes us most. It is said to\r\nhave been at a later period the favourite character of Charles II.\r\nAmong the other principal characters of the play are a proctor of\r\nthe Arches Court named Littlewit, who imagines himself to be a _bel\r\nesprit_ of the first order; his wife, and her mother, dame Purecraft,\r\nwho is a widow; Justice Overdo, a London magistrate, to whose ward,\r\nGrace Wellborn, Cokes is affianced in marriage; a zealous Puritan,\r\nnamed Zeal-of-the-land Busy, who is a suitor to the widow Purecraft,\r\nherself also a Puritan; Winwife, Busy's rival; and a gamester named\r\nTom Quarlous, who figures as Winwife's friend and companion. All these\r\nmeet in town, on the morning of the fair, Cokes under the care of a\r\nsort of steward or upper servant, named Waspe, who was of a quarrelsome\r\ndisposition, and separate in groups among the crowd which filled\r\nSmithfield and its vicinity, each having their separate adventures, but\r\nmeeting from time to time, and reassembling at the end. Cokes behaves\r\nas a simpleton from the country, longs for everything, and wonders at\r\neverything, buys up toys and gingerbread, is separated from all his\r\ncompanions, robbed of his money and even of his outer garments, and in\r\nthis condition finally settles down at a puppet-show. Meanwhile the\r\nPuritan Busy, by his zeal against the \"heathen abominations\" of the\r\nfair on one hand, and Waspe, by his quarrelsome temper on the other,\r\nfall into a series of scrapes, which end in both being carried to the\r\nstocks. They are there joined by another important personage. Justice\r\nOverdo, who is distinguished by an extraordinary zeal for the right\r\nadministration of justice and the suppression of social vices of all\r\nkinds, has come into the fair in disguise, in order to make himself\r\nacquainted with its various abuses, and he passes among them unknown;\r\nand his inquisitive intermeddling brings him into a variety of mishaps,\r\nin the course of which he also is seized by the constable, and allows\r\nhimself to be taken to the stocks, rather than betray his identity.\r\nThus all three, Busy, Waspe, and Overdo, are placed in the stocks\r\nat the same time; but Waspe, by a clever trick, escapes, and leaves\r\nthe Puritan and the justice confined together, the one looking upon\r\nhimself as a martyr for religion's sake, the other rather glorying in\r\nsuffering through his disinterested zeal for the common good. They,\r\ntoo, after a while make their escape through an accidental oversight of\r\ntheir keepers, and mix again with the mob. The women, likewise, have\r\nbeen separated from their male companions, have fallen among sharpers\r\nand bullies, been made drunk, and escaped but narrowly from still\r\nworse disasters. They all finally meet before the puppet-show, which\r\nhas fixed the attention of Cokes, and there justice Overdo discovers\r\nhimself. Such are the materials of Ben Jonson's \"Bartholomew Fair,\"\r\nthe busiest and most amusing of plays. It is said, when first acted,\r\nto have given great satisfaction to king James, by the ridicule thrown\r\nupon the Puritans, and it continued to be a favourite comedy when\r\nrevived after the Restoration.\r\n\r\n\"The Alchemist,\" by the same author, preceded \"Bartholomew Fair,\" by\r\nfour years, and was designed as a satire upon a class of impostors\r\nwho, in that age, were among the greatest pests of society, and were\r\ninstruments, one way or other, in the greatest crimes of the day.\r\n\"The Alchemist\" belongs, also, to the pure English comedy, but its\r\nplot is more simple and distinct than that of \"Bartholomew Fair.\" It\r\ninvolves events which may have occurred frequently, at periods when the\r\nmetropolis was from time to time exposed to the vicissitudes of the\r\nplague. On one of these occasions, Lovewit, a London gentleman, obliged\r\nto quit the metropolis in order to avoid the plague, leaves his town\r\nhouse to the charge of one man-servant, Face, who proves dishonest,\r\nassociates himself with a rogue named Subtle, and an immoral woman\r\nnamed Dol Common, and introduces them into the house, which is made the\r\nbasis for their subsequent operations. Subtle assumes the character of\r\na magician and alchemist, while Dol acts various female parts, and Face\r\ngoes about alluring people into their snares. Among their dupes are a\r\nknight who lives upon the town, two English Puritans from Amsterdam, a\r\nlawyer's clerk, a tobacco man, a young country squire, and his sister\r\ndame Pliant, a widow. The various intrigues in which these individuals\r\nare involved, show us the way in which the pretended conjurers and\r\nalchemists contributed to all the vices of the town. At length their\r\nbase dealings are on the point of being exposed by the cunning of\r\none upon whom they had attempted to impose, when Truewit, the master\r\nof the house, returns unexpectedly, and all is discovered, but the\r\nalchemist and his female associate contrive to escape. The object of\r\ntheir last intrigue had been to entrap dame Pliant, who was rich, into\r\na marriage with a needy sharper; and Lovewit, finding the lady in the\r\nhouse, and liking her, marries her himself, and, in consideration of\r\nthe satisfaction he has thus procured, forgives his unfaithful servant.\r\nMany have considered the Alchemist to be the best of Jonson's dramas.\r\n\"Epicœne, or the Silent Woman,\" which belongs to the year 1609, is\r\nanother satirical picture of London society, in which the same class of\r\ncharacters appear. Morose, an eccentric gentleman of fortune, who has\r\na great horror for noise, and even obliges his servants to communicate\r\nwith him by signs, has a nephew, a young knight named Sir Dauphine\r\nEugenie, with whom he is dissatisfied, and he refuses to allow him\r\nmoney for his support. A plot is laid by his friends, whereby the uncle\r\nis led into a marriage with a supposed silent woman, named Epicœne,\r\nbut she only sustains the character until the wedding formalities\r\nare completed, and these are followed by a scene of noise and riot,\r\nwhich completely horrifies Morose, and leads to a reconciliation with\r\nhis nephew, to whom he makes over half his fortune. The earliest of\r\nBen Jonson's comedies, \"Every Man in his Humour,\" was composed in\r\nits present form in 1598, and is the first of these dramatic satires\r\non the manners and character of the citizens of London, of whom it\r\nwas fashionable at the courts of James I. and Charles I. to speak\r\ncontemptuously. Kno'well, an old gentleman of respectability, is\r\nhighly displeased with his son Edward, because the latter has taken to\r\nwriting poetry, and has formed a friendship with another gentleman of\r\nhis own age, who loves poetry and frequents the rather gay society of\r\nthe poets and wits of the town. Wellbred has a half-brother, a \"plain\r\nsquire,\" named Downright, and a sister married to a rich city merchant\r\nnamed Kitely. Kitely, the merchant, who is extremely jealous of his\r\nwife, has a great desire to reform Wellbred, and draw him to a steadier\r\nline of life, a sentiment in which Downright heartily joins. Kitely's\r\njealousy, and the steps taken to reform Wellbred, lead to the most\r\ncomic parts of the play, which concludes with the marriage of young\r\nKno'well to Kitely's daughter, Miss Bridget, and his reconciliation\r\nwith his father. Among the other characters in the piece are captain\r\nBobadil, \"a blustering coward,\" justice Clement, \"an old merry\r\nmagistrate,\" his clerk, Roger Formal, and a country gull and a town\r\ngull.\r\n\r\nThese comedies of London life became popular, and continued so\r\nduring this and the following reign--in fact, the mass of those who\r\nattended the theatres could understand and appreciate them better\r\nthan any others, and, what was more, they felt them. Among Jonson's\r\ncontemporaries in the literature of this English comedy were Middleton\r\nand Thomas Heywood, both very prolific writers, Chapman, and Marston.\r\nCertain classes of characters are continually repeated in this comedy,\r\nbecause they belonged especially to the London society of the time,\r\nbut the employment and distribution of these characters admitted of\r\ngreat variations, and they perhaps often had at the time a special\r\ninterest, as representing known individuals, or as being combined in a\r\nplot which was built upon real incidents in London life. Among these\r\nwere usually a country gentleman of fortune, who was very avaricious,\r\nand had a spendthrift son, or who had a daughter, a rich heiress, who\r\nwas the object of the intrigues of spendthrift suitors; young heirs,\r\nwho have just come to their estates, and are spending them in London;\r\nyoung country squires who are easy victims; a needy knight, as poor\r\nin principles as in money, who lived upon the public in every way he\r\ncould; designing and unscrupulous women; bullies and sharpers of every\r\ndescription. In fact, we seem to be always in the smell of the tavern,\r\nand in the midst of dissipation. Then there are fat, sleek, and wealthy\r\ncitizens, whole souls are entirely wrapt up in their merchandise,\r\nwho are proud, nevertheless, of their position; and easy, credulous\r\ncity wives, who are fond of finery and of praise, eager for gaiety\r\nand display, impatient of the rule of husbands, or of the dulness of\r\nhome, and very ready to listen to the advances of the gay gallants\r\nfrom the court end of the town, or from the tavern. The city tradesman\r\nhas generally an apprentice or two, sometimes very sober but perhaps\r\nmore frequently dissipated, who play their parts in the piece; and\r\noften a daughter, who is either a model of modesty and all the domestic\r\nvirtues, and is finally the reward of some hero of good principles,\r\nwho has been temporarily led astray, and his character misinterpreted,\r\nor who is gay and intriguing, and comes to disgrace. But the favourite\r\nidea of excellence, or, to use a technical phrase, the _beau ideal_\r\nof this comedy, appears to have been a wild youth, who goes through\r\nevery scene of dissipation, in a gentlemanly manner (as the term was\r\nthen understood), and comes out at the end of the play as an honest,\r\nvirtuous man, and receives the reward for qualities which he had not\r\npreviously displayed.\r\n\r\nSometimes the writers of this comedy indulged in personal, or even\r\nin political, allusions which brought them into trouble. In the year\r\n1605, Ben Jonson, George Chapman, and John Marston, wrote jointly a\r\ncomedy entitled \"Eastward Hoe.\" It is a very excellent and amusing\r\ncomedy, and was very popular. Touchstone, an honest goldsmith in the\r\ncity, has two apprentices, Golding, a sober and industrious youth, and\r\nQuicksilver, who is an irreclaimable rake. Touchstone has also two\r\ndaughters, the eldest of whom, Gertrude, affects the fine lady, and\r\nis ambitious of finding a husband in the fashionable world, while her\r\nyounger sister, Mildred, is all virtue and humility. An attachment\r\narises between Golding and Mildred. Another character in this drama\r\nis a needy, scheming knight, who lives upon the town, and rejoices in\r\nthe name of Sir Petronel Flash. Sir Petronel is attracted by the rich\r\ndowry which the young lady, Gertrude, had to expect, pays his court\r\nto her, and easily works upon her vanity; and, her mother encouraging\r\nher, they are hastily married, contrary to the wishes of her father.\r\nThe knight is supposed to possess a magnificent castle somewhere to the\r\neast of London, and the young bride and her mother proceed in search of\r\nthis, from which the comedy derives its title of \"Eastward Hoe,\" but\r\nthey are involved in various disagreeable adventures in the search,\r\nwhich ends in the conviction that it is all a fable. Another character\r\nin the play is a greedy and unprincipled usurer, who is so jealous of\r\nhis young and pretty wife, that he keeps her under lock and key; and\r\nthis man is deeply involved in money-lending with Sir Petronel Flash,\r\nand they are engaged in a series of unprincipled transactions, which\r\nlead to the disgrace of them all, and in the course of which the virtue\r\nof the usurer's wife falls a sacrifice. Meanwhile the fortunes of the\r\ntwo apprentices have been advancing in directly opposite directions.\r\nQuicksilver, the unworthy apprentice, leaves his master, proceeds\r\nfrom bad to worse, and finally is committed to prison, for a crime\r\nthe punishment of which was death. On the other hand, Golding has not\r\nonly gained his master's esteem and married his daughter Mildred, and\r\nbeen adopted as the heir to his wealth, but he has merited the respect\r\nof his fellow-citizens, and has been promoted in municipal rank. It\r\nbecomes Golding's duty to preside over the trial of his old fellow\r\napprentice Quicksilver, but the latter escapes through Golding's\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nThere is some sound morality in the spirit of this comedy, and a\r\nvery large amount of immorality in the text. There was, indeed, a\r\ncoarse licence in the relations of society at this period, which are\r\nbut too faithfully represented in its literature. But there are two\r\ncircumstances, accidentally attached to this drama, which give it\r\na peculiar interest. When brought out upon the stage it contained\r\nreflections upon Scotchmen which provoked the anger of king James I.\r\nto such a degree, that all the authors were seized and thrown into\r\nprison, and narrowly escaped the loss of their ears and noses, but they\r\nobtained their release with some difficulty, and only through powerful\r\nintercession. In the copy which has been brought down to us through\r\nthe press, we find no reflections whatever upon Scotchmen, so that it\r\nmust have been altered from the original text. When we consider that,\r\nat this time, the English court and capital were crowded with needy\r\nScottish adventurers, who were looked upon with great jealousy, it is\r\nnot improbable that in the original form of the comedy, Sir Petronel\r\nFlash may have been a Scotchman, and intended not only as a satire upon\r\nthe Scottish adventurers in general, but to have been designed for some\r\none in particular who had the means of bringing upon the authors the\r\nextreme displeasure of the court.\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance which has given celebrity to this comedy, is one\r\nof still greater interest. After the Restoration, it was new modelled\r\nby Nicholas Tate, and brought again upon the stage under the title of\r\n\"Cuckold's Haven.\" Perhaps through this remodelled edition, Hogarth\r\ntook from the comedy of \"Eastward Hoe,\" the idea of his series of\r\nplates of the history of the Idle and Industrious Apprentices.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the ridicule which was continually thrown upon them\r\nin this earlier period of the English comedy, we can easily understand\r\nthe bitterness with which the Puritans regarded the stage and the\r\ndrama. When they obtained power, the stage, as might be expected, was\r\nsuppressed, and for some years England was without a theatre. At the\r\nRestoration, however, the theatres were opened again, and with greater\r\nfreedom than ever. At first the old comedies of the days of James I.\r\nand Charles I. were revived, and many of them, modified and adapted to\r\nthe new circumstances, were again brought upon the stage. The original\r\ncomedies which appeared immediately after the Restoration, were often\r\nmarked with a political tinge; as the stage saw its natural protectors\r\nin the court, and in the court party, it embraced their politics; and\r\nPuritans, Roundheads, Whigs, all whose principles were supposed to be\r\ncontrary to royalty and arbitrary power, fell under its satire. Such\r\nwas the character of the comedy of \"The Cheats,\" by a play-writer of\r\nsome repute named Wilson, which was brought out in 1662. The object\r\nof this play appears to have been, in the first place, to satirise\r\nthe Nonconformists or Puritanical clergy--with whom were classed the\r\nastrologers and conjurers, who had increased in number during the\r\nCommonwealth time, and infested society more than ever--and the city\r\nmagistrates, who were not looked upon as being generally over-loyal.\r\nThe three cheats who are the heroes of this comedy, are Scruple, the\r\nNonconformist, Mopus, a pretender to physic and astrology, and alderman\r\nWhitebroth. Direct personal attacks had been introduced into the comedy\r\nof the Restoration, and it is probable that somebody of influence was\r\nsatirised under the name of Scruple, for the play was suppressed by\r\nauthority, and at a later period, when it was revived, the prologue\r\nannounces this fact in the following words:--\r\n\r\n          _Sad news, my masters; and too true, I fear,\r\n          For us--Scruple's a silenc'd minister.\r\n          Would ye the cause? The brethren snivel, and say,\r\n          'Tis scandalous that any cheat but they._\r\n\r\nMany of the dramatists of the Restoration were men of good and\r\naristocratic families, witty and profligate cavaliers, who had returned\r\nfrom exile with their king. The family of the earl of Berkshire\r\nproduced no less than four writers of comedy, all brothers, Edward\r\nHoward, colonel Henry Howard, sir Robert Howard, and James Howard,\r\nwhile their sister, the lady Elizabeth Howard, was married to the\r\npoet Dryden. Edward Howard's first dramatic piece was a tragi-comedy\r\nentitled \"The Usurper,\" which came out in 1668, and was intended as\r\na satire upon Cromwell. His best known comedies were \"The Man of\r\nNewmarket,\" and \"Woman's Conquest.\" Colonel Henry Howard composed a\r\ncomedy entitled \"United Kingdoms,\" which appears not to have been\r\nprinted. To James Howard, the youngest of the brothers, the play-going\r\npublic, even then rather a large one, owed \"The English Mounsieur,\"\r\nand \"All Mistaken, or the Mad Couple.\" Sir Robert Howard was the best\r\nwriter of the four, and wrote both tragedies and comedies, which were\r\nafterwards published collectively. The best of his comedies is \"The\r\nCommittee,\" which was first brought on the stage in 1665, and through\r\nsome chance, certainly not by its merit, continued to be an acting play\r\nduring the whole of the last century.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee\" is by far the best of the dramatic writings of the\r\nHowards. Its design was to turn to ridicule the Commonwealth men and\r\nthe Puritans. Colonel Blunt and colonel Careless are two royalists,\r\nwhose estates are in the hands of the committee of sequestrations,\r\nand who repair to London for the purpose of compounding for them.\r\nThe chairman of the committee is a Mr. Day, a worldly-minded and\r\nsufficiently selfish Puritan, but who is ruled by his more crafty and\r\nstill less scrupulous wife, a designing and very talkative woman. Both\r\nare of low origin, for Mrs. Day had been a kitchen-woman, and both are\r\nvery proud and very tyrannical. Among the other principal characters\r\nare Abel Day, their son, Obadiah, the clerk to the committee, a man in\r\nthe interest of the Days, and an Irish servant named Teague, who had\r\nbeen the servant of Careless's dear friend, a royalist officer killed\r\nin battle, and whom the colonel finds in great distress, and takes into\r\nhis own service out of charity. The character of Teague is a very poor\r\ncaricature upon an Irishman, and his blunders and bulls are of a very\r\nspiritless description. Here is an example. Teague has overheard the\r\ntwo colonels state that they should be obliged to take the Covenant,\r\nand express their reluctance to do it, and in his inconsiderate zeal,\r\nhe hurries away to try if he cannot take the covenant for them, and\r\nthus save them a disagreeable operation. In the street he meets a\r\nwandering bookseller--a class of pedlars who were then common--and a\r\nscene takes place which is best given in the words of the original:--\r\n\r\n    _Bookseller._--New books, new books! A Desperate Plot and\r\n       Engagement of the Bloody Cavaliers! Mr. Saltmarshe's Alarum\r\n       to the Nation, after having been three days dead! Mercurius\r\n       Britannicus--\r\n\r\n    _Teague._--How's that? They cannot live in Ireland after they are\r\n       dead three days!\r\n\r\n    _Book._--Mercurius Britannicus, or the Weekly Post, or the Solemn\r\n       League and Covenant!\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--What is that you say? Is it the Covenant you have?\r\n\r\n    _Book._--Yes; what then, sir?\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--Which is that Covenant?\r\n\r\n    _Book._--Why, this is the Covenant.\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--Well, I must take that Covenant.\r\n\r\n    _Book._--You take my commodities?\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--I must take that Covenant, upon my soul, now.\r\n\r\n    _Book._--Stand off, sir, or I'll set you further!\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--Well, upon my soul, now, I will take the Covenant for my\r\n       master.\r\n\r\n    _Book._--Your master must pay me for't, then!\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--I must take it first, and my master will pay you\r\n       afterwards.\r\n\r\n    _Book._--You must pay me now.\r\n\r\n    _Teag._--Oh! that I will [_Knocks him down_]. Now you're paid, you\r\n       thief of the world. Here's Covenants enough to poison the whole\r\n       nation.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n    _Book._--What a devil ails this fellow? [_Crying_]. He did not come\r\n       to rob me, certainly; for he has not taken above two-pennyworth\r\n       of lamentable ware away; but I feel the rascal's fingers. I may\r\n       light upon my wild Irishman again, and, if I do, I will fix him\r\n       with some catchpole, that shall be worse than his own country\r\n       bogs.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\nIn the sequel, Teague is caught by the constables, and is liberated\r\nat the interference of his master, who pays twopence for the book.\r\nThe plot of the comedy is but a simple one, and is neither skilfully\r\nnor naturally carried out. Colonel Blunt comes to London from Reading\r\nin the inside of a stage-coach, having for his travelling companions\r\nMrs. Day, her supposed daughter Ruth, and Arabella, a young lady whose\r\nfather is recently dead, leaving his estates in the hands of the\r\ncommittee of sequestrations. Ruth is, in truth, a young lady whose\r\nestates the Days have, under similar circumstances, robbed her of, and\r\nit is their design to treat Arabella in the same manner, under disguise\r\nof forcing her to marry their son Abel, a vain silly lad. To effect\r\nthis, as the committee itself requires some influencing to engage them\r\nin the selfish plans of their chairman, Day and his wife forge a letter\r\nfrom the exiled king, complimenting the former on his great power and\r\ninfluence and talents as a statesman, and offering him great rewards\r\nif he will secretly promote his cause. Day communicates this to the\r\ncommittee under the pretext that it is his duty to make them acquainted\r\nwith all such perfidious designs that might come to his knowledge, and\r\nthey, convinced of his honesty and value to them, give up Arabella's\r\nestates to the Days, and she falls entirely under their power.\r\nMeanwhile, on the one hand, Arabella has gained the confidence of\r\nRuth, who makes her acquainted with the whole plot against her and her\r\nestates, and on the other, Ruth falls in love with colonel Careless,\r\nand colonel Blunt is smitten with the charms of Arabella, and all this\r\ntakes place in the committee room. Various incidents follow, which seem\r\nnot very much to the purpose, but at last, as the marriage of Arabella\r\nto Abel Day is pressed forward, the two young ladies, although as yet\r\nthey have hardly had an interview with the colonels, resolve to make\r\ntheir escape from the house of the chairman of the committee, and fly\r\nto their lovers for protection. A short absence from the house of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Day and their son together, presents the desired opportunity,\r\nand Day having accidentally left his keys behind him, the idea suggests\r\nitself to Ruth to open his cabinet, and gain possession of the deeds\r\nand papers of her own estates and those of Arabella. As she had before\r\nthis secretly observed the private drawer in which they were placed,\r\nshe met with no difficulty in effecting her purpose, and not only found\r\nthese documents, but also with them the forged letter from the king,\r\nand some letters addressed to Day by young women whom he was secretly\r\nkeeping, and who demanded money for the support of children they had by\r\nhim, and alluded to matters of a still more serious character. Ruth\r\ntakes possession of all these, and thus laden, the two damsels hurry\r\naway, and reach without interruption the house where they were to meet\r\nthe colonels. The Days return home immediately after the departure\r\nof their wards, and at once suspect the real state of affairs, which\r\nis fully confirmed, when Mr. Day finds that his most private drawer\r\nhas been opened, and his most important papers carried off. They\r\nimmediately proceed in search of the fugitives, having sent orders for\r\na detachment of soldiers to assist them, and the house in which the\r\nlovers have taken refuge is surrounded before they have had time to\r\nescape. Finding it useless to attempt resistance by force, the besieged\r\ncall for a parley, and then Ruth frightens Day by acquainting him with\r\nthe contents of the private letters she has become possessed of, and\r\nhis wife by the knowledge she has obtained of the forged letter, which\r\nalso she has in her possession. The Days are thus overreached, and the\r\nplay ends with a general reconciliation. The ladies are left with the\r\ntitles of their estates, and with their lovers, and we are left to\r\nsuppose that they afterwards married, and were happy.\r\n\r\nThe plot of \"The Committee,\" it will be seen, is not a very capital\r\none, but the manner in which it is worked out is still worse. The\r\ndialogue is extremely tame, and the incidents are badly interwoven.\r\nWhen I say that the example of wit given above is the best in the play,\r\nand that there are not many attempts at wit in it, it will hardly be\r\nthought that it could be amusing, and we cannot but feel astonished\r\nat the popularity which it once enjoyed. This popularity, indeed, is\r\nonly explained by the fashion of ridiculing the Puritans, which then\r\nprevailed so strongly; and it perhaps retained its place on the stage\r\nduring the last century chiefly from the circumstance of its wanting\r\nthe objectionable qualities which characterised the written plays of\r\nthe latter half of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee\" is, after all, one of the very best comedies of the\r\nschool of dramatists represented by the brothers Howard. Contemporary\r\nwith this school of flat comedies, there was a school of equally\r\ninflated tragedy, and both soon became objects of ridicule to the\r\nsatirists of the day. Of these, one of the boldest was George Villiers,\r\nduke of Buckingham, the son of the favourite of king James I., and\r\nequally celebrated for his talents and his profligacy. Buckingham is\r\nsaid to have planned and begun his satirical comedy of \"The Rehearsal\"\r\nas early as the year 1663, and to have had it ready for representation\r\ntowards the December of 1665, when the breaking out of the great plague\r\ncaused the theatres to be closed. After this interruption its author,\r\nwho was a desultory writer, appears to have laid it aside for some\r\ntime and then, new objects for satire having presented themselves, he\r\naltered and modified it, and it was finally completed in 1671, when it\r\nwas brought out at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden. It is said that\r\nBuckingham was assisted in the composition of this satire, but it is\r\nnot stated in what manner, by Butler, and by Martin Clifford, of the\r\nCharter-house. It is understood that, in the first form of his satire,\r\nBuckingham had chosen the Hon. Edward Howard for its hero, and that he\r\nafterwards exchanged him for Sir William Davenant, but he finally fixed\r\nupon Dryden, whose tragedies and comedies are certainly not the best of\r\nhis writings--possibly some personal pique may have had an influence\r\nin the selection. Nevertheless, with Dryden, the Howards, Davenant,\r\nand one or two other writers of comedy, come in for their share of\r\nridicule. Dryden, under the name of Bayes, has composed a new drama,\r\nand a friend named Johnson goes to witness the rehearsal of this play,\r\ntaking with him a country friend of the name of Smith. The play itself\r\nis a piece of mockery throughout, made up of parodies, often very\r\nhappy, on the different play-writers of the day, and especially upon\r\nDryden; and it is mixed up with a running conversation between Bayes,\r\nthe author, and his two visitors, which is full of satirical humour.\r\nThe first part of the prologue explains to us sufficiently the spirit\r\nin which this satire was written.\r\n\r\n        _We might well call this short mock-play of ours\r\n        A posie made of weeds instead of flowers;\r\n        Yet such have been presented to your noses,\r\n        And there are such, I fear, who thought 'em roses.\r\n        Would some of 'em were here, to see this night\r\n        What stuff it is in which they took delight.\r\n        Here, brisk, insipid rogues, for wit, let fall\r\n        Sometimes dull sense, but oft'ner none at all;\r\n        There, strutting heroes, with a grim-fac'd train,\r\n        Shalt brave the gods, in king Cambyses vein.\r\n        For (changing rules, of late, as if men writ\r\n        In spite of reason, nature, art, and wit)\r\n        Our poets make us laugh at tragedy,\r\n        And with their comedies they make us cry._\r\n\r\nA short account of this satire will, perhaps, be best understood, if I\r\nexplain that the antagonism of two contending kings of Granada having\r\nbeen a favourite idea of Dryden in his tragedies, Buckingham is said to\r\nhave designed to ridicule him in making two, not rival, but associate\r\nkings of Brentford, though others say that these two kings of Brentford\r\nwere intended for a sneer upon king Charles II. and the duke of York.\r\nThese two kings are the heroes of Bayes's play. The first act of\r\n\"The Rehearsal\" consists of a discussion between Bayes, Johnson, and\r\nSmith, on the general character of the play, in which Bayes exhibits\r\na large amount of vanity and self-confidence, said to have been a\r\ncharacteristic of all these play-writers of the earlier period of the\r\nRestoration, and he informs them that he has \"made a prologue and an\r\nepilogue, which may both serve for either; that is, the prologue for\r\nthe epilogue, or the epilogue for the prologue, (do you mark!) nay,\r\nthey may both serve, too, 'egad, for any other play as well as this.\"\r\nSmith observes, \"That's indeed artificial.\" Finally Bayes explains,\r\nthat as other authors, in their prologues, sought to flatter and\r\npropitiate their audience, in order to gain their favourable opinion of\r\nthe plot, he, on the contrary, intended to force their applause out of\r\nthem by mere dint of terror, and for that purpose, he had introduced\r\nas speakers of his prologue, no less personages than Thunder and\r\nLightning. This prologue, disengaged from the remarks of Bayes and his\r\nfriends, runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n                    _Enter_ THUNDER _and_ LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n        _Thun._--I am the bold Thunder.\r\n\r\n        _Light._--The brisk Lightning I.\r\n\r\n        _Thun._--I am the bravest Hector of the sky.\r\n\r\n        _Light._--And I fair Helen, that made Hector die.\r\n\r\n        _Thun._--I strike men down.\r\n\r\n        _Light._--I fire the town.\r\n\r\n        _Thun_.--Let critics take heed how they grumble,\r\n                 For then I begin for to rumble.\r\n\r\n        _Light_.--Let the ladies allow us their graces,\r\n                  Or I'll blast all the paint on their faces,\r\n                  And dry up their peter to soot.\r\n\r\n        _Thun_.--Let the critics look to't.\r\n\r\n        _Light_.--Let the ladies look to't.\r\n\r\n        _Thun_.--For the Thunder will do't.\r\n\r\n        _Light_.--For the Lightning will shoot.\r\n\r\n        _Thun_.--I'll give you dash for dash.\r\n\r\n        _Light_.--I'll give you flash for flash.\r\n                  Gallants, I'll singe your feather.\r\n\r\n        _Thun_.--I'll Thunder you together.\r\n\r\n        _Both_.--Look to't, look to't; we'll do't, we'll do't;\r\n                 look to't; we'll do't. [_Twice or thrice repeated._\r\n\r\nBayes calls this \"but a slash of a prologue,\" in reply to which, Smith\r\nobserves, \"Yes; 'tis short, indeed, but very terrible.\" It is a parody\r\non a scene in \"The Slighted Maid,\" a play by Sir Robert Stapleton,\r\nwhere Thunder and Lightning were introduced, and their conversation\r\nbegins in the same words. But the poet has another difficulty on which\r\nhe desires the opinion of his visitors. \"I have made,\" he says, \"one of\r\nthe most delicate, dainty similes in the whole world, 'egad, if I knew\r\nhow to apply it. 'Tis,\" he adds, \"an allusion to love.\" This is the\r\nsimile--\r\n\r\n          _So boar and sow, when any storm is nigh\r\n          Snuff up, and smell it gathering in the sky;\r\n          Boar beckons sow to trot in chesnut groves,\r\n          And there consummate their unfinished loves:\r\n          Pensive in mud they wallow all alone,\r\n          And snore and gruntle to each others moan._\r\n\r\nIt is a rather coarse, but clever parody on a simile in Dryden's\r\n\"Conquest of Granada,\" part ii.:--\r\n\r\n          _So two kind turtles, when a storm is nigh,\r\n          Look up, and see it gathering in the sky;\r\n          Each calls his mate to shelter in the groves,\r\n          Leaving, in murmurs, their unfinished loves;\r\n          Perch'd on some dropping branch, they sit alone,\r\n          And coo, and hearken to each other's moan._\r\n\r\nIt is decided that the simile should be added to the prologue, for, as\r\nJohnson remarks to Bayes, \"Faith, 'tis extraordinary fine, and very\r\napplicable to Thunder and Lightning, methinks, because it speaks of a\r\nstorm.\" In the second act we come to the opening of the play, the first\r\nscene consisting of whispering, in ridicule of a scene in Davenant's\r\n\"Play-house to Let,\" where Drake senior says--\r\n\r\n          _Draw up your men,\r\n          And in low whispers give your orders out._\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Gentleman-Usher and the Physician of the two kings of\r\nBrentford appear upon the scene alone, and discuss a plot to dethrone\r\nthe two kings of Brentford, which they communicate by whispers into\r\neach other's ears, which are totally inaudible. In Scene ii., \"Enter\r\nthe two kings, hand in hand,\" and Bayes remarks to his visitors,\r\n\"Oh! these are now the two kings of Brentford; take notice of their\r\nstyle--'twas never yet upon the stage; but, if you like it, I could\r\nmake a shift, perhaps, to show you a whole play, writ all just so.\" The\r\nkings begin, rather familiarly, because, as Bayes adds, \"they are both\r\npersons of the same quality:\"--\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--Did you observe their whispers, brother king?\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--I did, and heard, besides, a grave bird sing,\r\n                   That they intend, sweetheart, to play us pranks.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--If that design appears,\r\n                   I'll lay them by the ears,\r\n                   Until I make 'em crack.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--And so will I, i' fack!\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--You must begin, _mon foi_.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--Sweet sir, _pardonnez moi_.\r\n\r\nBayes observes that he makes the two kings talk French in order\r\n\"to show their breeding.\" In the third act, Bayes introduces a new\r\ncharacter, prince Prettyman, a parody upon the character of Leonidas,\r\nin Dryden's \"Marriage-a-la-Mode.\" The prince falls asleep, and then\r\nhis beloved Cloris comes in, and is surprised, upon which Bayes\r\nremarks, \"Now, here she must make a simile.\" \"Where's the necessity of\r\nthat, Mr. Bayes?\" asks the critical Mr. Smith. \"Oh,\" replies Bayes,\r\n\"because she's surprised. That's a general rule. You must ever make\r\na simile when you are surprised; 'tis a new way of writing.\" Now\r\nwe have another parody upon one of Dryden's similes. In the fourth\r\nscene, the Gentleman-Usher and Physician appear again, discussing the\r\nquestion whether their whispers had been heard or not, a discussion\r\nwhich they conclude by seizing on the two thrones, and occupying them\r\nwith their drawn swords in their hands. Then they march out to raise\r\ntheir forces, and a battle to music takes place, four soldiers on each\r\nside, who are all killed. Next we have a scene between prince Prettyman\r\nand his tailor, Tom Thimble, which involves a joke upon the princely\r\nprinciple of non-payment. A scene or two follows in a similar tone,\r\nwithout at all advancing the plot; although it appears that another\r\nprince, Volscius, who, we are to suppose, supports the old dynasty of\r\nBrentford, has made his escape to Piccadilly, while the army which he\r\nis to lead has assembled, and is concealed, at Knightsbridge. This\r\nincident produces a discussion between Mr. Bayes and his friends:--\r\n\r\n    _Smith._--But pray, Mr. Bayes, is not this a little difficult, that\r\n          you were saying e'en now, to keep an army thus concealed in\r\n          Knightsbridge?\r\n\r\n    _Bayes._--In Knightsbridge?--stay.\r\n\r\n    _Johnson._--No, not if inn-keepers be his friends.[100]\r\n\r\n    _Bayes._--His friends? Ay, sir, his intimate acquaintance; or else,\r\n          indeed, I grant it could not be.\r\n\r\n    _Smith._--Yes, faith, so it might be very easy.\r\n\r\n    _Bayes._--Nay, if I don't make all things easy, 'egad, I'll give\r\n          'em leave to hang me. Now you would think that he is going\r\n          out of town; but you will see how prettily I have contrived\r\n          to stop him, presently.\r\n\r\n [100] Knightsbridge, as the principal entrance to London from the west,\r\n       was full of inns.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, prince Volscius yields to the influence of a fair\r\n_demoiselle_, who bears the classical name of Parthenope, and after\r\nvarious exhibitions of hesitation, he does not leave town. Another\r\nscene or two, with little meaning, but full of clever parodies on the\r\nplays of Dryden, the Howards, and their contemporaries. The first scene\r\nof the fourth act opens with a funeral, a parody upon colonel Henry\r\nHoward's play of the \"United Kingdoms.\" Pallas interferes, brings the\r\nlady who is to be buried to life, gets up a dance, and furnishes a very\r\nextempore feast. The princes Prettyman and Volscius dispute about their\r\nsweethearts. At the commencement of the fifth act the two usurping\r\nkings appear in state, attended by four cardinals, the two princes,\r\nall the lady-loves, heralds, and sergeants-at-arms, &c. In the middle\r\nof all this state, \"the two right kings of Brentford descend in the\r\nclouds, singing, in white garments, and three fiddlers sitting before\r\nthem in green.\" \"Now,\" says Bayes to his friends, \"because the two\r\nright kings descend from above, I make 'em sing to the tune and style\r\nof our modern spirits.\" And accordingly they proceeded in a continuous\r\nparody:--\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--Haste, brother king, we are sent from above.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--Let us move, let us move;\r\n                   Move, to remove the fate\r\n                   Of Brentford's long united state.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--Tara, tan, tara!--full east and by south.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--We sail with thunder in our mouth.\r\n                   In scorching noon-day, whilst the traveller stays,\r\n                     Busy, busy, busy, busy, we bustle along,\r\n                   Mounted upon warm Phœbus's rays,\r\n                       Through the heavenly throng,\r\n                         Hasting to those\r\n                   Who will feast us at night with a pig's pettytoes.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--And we'll fall with our plate\r\n                   In an olio of hate\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--But, now supper's done, the servitors try,\r\n                   Like soldiers, to storm a whole half-moon pie.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--They gather, they gather, hot custards in spoons:\r\n                   But, alas! I must leave these half-moons,\r\n                   And repair to my trusty dragoons.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--O stay! for you need not as yet go astray;\r\n                   The tide, like a friend, has brought ships in our way,\r\n                   And on their high ropes we will play;\r\n                   Like maggots in filberts, we'll snug in our shell,\r\n                           We'll frisk in our shell,\r\n                           We'll firk in our shell,\r\n                                 And farewell.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--But the ladies have all inclination to dance,\r\n                   And the green frogs croak out a coranto of France.\r\n\r\nAll this is quite Aristophanic. It is interrupted by a discussion\r\nbetween Bayes and his visitors on the music and the dance, and then the\r\ntwo kings continue:--\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--Now mortals, that hear\r\n                   How we tilt and career,\r\n                   With wonder, will fear\r\n               The event of such things as shall never appear.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--Stay you to fulfil what the gods have decreed.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--Then call me to help you, if there shall be need.\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--So firmly resolved is a true Brentford king,\r\n                   To save the distressed, and help to 'em bring,\r\n                   That, ere a full pot of good ale you can swallow,\r\n                   He's here with a whoop, and gone with a halloo.\r\n\r\nThe rather too inquisitive Smith wonders at all this, and complains\r\nthat, to him, the sense of this is \"not very plain.\" \"Plain!\" exclaims\r\nBayes, \"why, did you ever hear any people in the clouds speak plain?\r\nThey must be all for flight of fancy, at its full range, without the\r\nleast check or control upon it. When once you tie up sprites and people\r\nin clouds to speak plain, you spoil all.\" The two kings of Brentford\r\nnow \"light out of the clouds, and step into the throne,\" continuing the\r\nsame _dignified_ conversation:--\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--Come, now to serious council we'll advance.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--I do agree; but first, let's have a dance.\r\n\r\nThis confidence of the two kings of Brentford is suddenly disturbed\r\nby the sound of war. Two heralds announce that the army, that of\r\nKnightsbridge, had come to protect them, and that it had come _in\r\ndisguise_, an arrangement which puzzles the author's two visitors:--\r\n\r\n      _1st King._--What saucy groom molests our privacies?\r\n\r\n      _1st Herald._--The army's at the door, and, in disguise,\r\n                     Desires a word with both your majesties.\r\n\r\n      _2nd Herald._--Having from Knightsbridge hither march'd by stealth.\r\n\r\n      _2nd King._--Bid 'em attend a while, and drink our health.\r\n\r\n      _Smith._--How, Mr. Bayes? The army in disguise!\r\n\r\n      _Bayes._--Ay, sir, for fear the usurpers might discover them, that\r\n                went out but just now.\r\n\r\nWar itself follows, and the commanders of the two armies, the general\r\nand the lieutenant-general, appear upon the stage in another parody\r\nupon the opening scenes of Dryden's \"Siege of Rhodes:\"--\r\n\r\n     _Enter, at several doors, the_ GENERAL _and_ LIEUTENANT-GENERAL,\r\n     _armed cap-à-pie, with each a lute in his hand, and his sword\r\n     drawn, and hung with a scarlet riband at the wrist_.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--Villain, thou liest.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--Arm, arm, Gonsalvo, arm. What! ho!\r\n              The lie no flesh can brook, I trow.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--Advance from Acton with the musqueteers.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--Draw down the Chelsea cuirassiers.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--The band you boast of, Chelsea cuirassiers,\r\n                     Shall in my Putney pikes now meet their peers.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--Chiswickians, aged, and renowned in fight,\r\n                Join with the Hammersmith brigade.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--You'll find my Mortlake boys will do them right,\r\n                       Unless by Fulham numbers over-laid.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--Let the left wing of Twick'n'am foot advance,\r\n              And line that eastern hedge.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--The horse I raised in Petty France\r\n                     Shall try their chance,\r\n                     And scour the meadows, overgrown with sedge.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--Stand: give the word.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--Bright sword.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--That may be thine,\r\n              But 'tis not mine.\r\n\r\n      _Lieut.-Gen._--Give fire, give fire, at once give fire,\r\n                     And let those recreant troops perceive mine ire.\r\n\r\n      _Gen._--Pursue, pursue; they fly,\r\n              That first did give the lie!             [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\nThus the battle is carried on in talk between two individuals. Bayes\r\nalleges, as an excuse for introducing these trivial names of places,\r\nthat \"the spectators know all these towns, and may easily conceive\r\nthem to be within the dominions of the two kings of Brentford.\"\r\nThe battle is finally stopped by an eclipse, and three personages,\r\nrepresenting the sun, moon, and earth, advance upon the stage, and\r\nby dint of singing and manœuvring, one gets in a line between the\r\nother two, and this, according to the strict rules of astronomy,\r\nconstituted the eclipse. The eclipse is followed by another battle\r\nof a more desperate character, to which a stop is put in an equally\r\nextraordinary manner, by the entrance of the furious hero Drawcansir,\r\nwho slays all the combatants on both sides. The marriage of prince\r\nPrettyman was to form the subject of the fifth act, but while Bayes,\r\nJohnson, and Smith withdraw temporarily, all the players, in disgust,\r\nrun away to their dinners, and thus ends \"The Rehearsal\" of Mr. Bayes's\r\nplay. The epilogue returns to the moral which the play was designed to\r\ninculcate:--\r\n\r\n          _The play is at an end, but where's the plot?\r\n          That circumstance the poet Bayes forgot.\r\n          And we can boast, though 'tis a plotting age,\r\n          No place is freer from it than the stage._\r\n\r\nFormerly people sought to write so that they might be understood, but\r\n\"this new way of wit\" was altogether incomprehensible:--\r\n\r\n          _Wherefore, for ours, and for the kingdom's peace,\r\n          May this prodigious way of writing cease;\r\n          Let's have, at least once in our lives, a time\r\n          When we may hear some reason, not all rhyme.\r\n          We have this ten years felt its influence;\r\n          Pray let this prove a year of prose and sense._\r\n\r\nEnglish comedy was certainly greatly reformed, in some senses of the\r\nword reform, during the period which followed the publication of \"The\r\nRehearsal,\" and, in the hands of writers like Wycherley, Shadwell,\r\nCongreve, and D'Urfey, the dulness of the Howards was exchanged for\r\nan extreme degree of vivacity. The plot was as little considered as\r\never--it was a mere peg on which to hang scenes brilliant with wit\r\nand _repartee_. The small intrigue is often but a frame for a great\r\npicture of society in its forms then most open to caricature, with\r\nall the petty intrigues inseparable from it. \"Epsom Wells,\" one of\r\nShadwell's earlier comedies, and perhaps his best, will bear comparison\r\nwith Jonson's \"Bartholomew Fair.\" The personages represented in it\r\nare exactly those which then shone in such society--three \"men of wit\r\nand pleasure,\" one of the class of country squires whom the wits of\r\nLondon loved to laugh at, and who is described as \"a country justice,\r\na public spirited, politick, discontented fop, an immoderate hater of\r\nLondon, and a lover of the country above measure, a hearty true English\r\ncoxcomb.\" Then we have \"two cheating, sharking, cowardly bullies.\"\r\nThe citizens of London are represented by Bisket, \"a comfit-maker, a\r\nquiet, humble, civil cuckold, governed by his wife, whom he very much\r\nfears and loves at the same time, and is very proud of,\" and Fribble,\r\n\"a haberdasher, a surly cuckold, very conceited, and proud of his\r\nwife, but pretends to govern and keep her under,\" and their wives, the\r\nfirst \"an impertinent, imperious strumpet,\" and the other, \"an humble,\r\nsubmitting wife, who jilts her husband that way, a very ----.\" One\r\nor two other characters of the same stamp, with \"two young ladies of\r\nwit, beauty, and fortune,\" who behave themselves not much better than\r\nthe others, and a full allowance of \"parsons, hectors, constables,\r\nwatchmen, and fiddlers,\" complete the _dramatis personæ_ of \"Epsom\r\nWells.\" With such materials anybody will understand the character of\r\nthe piece, which was brought out on the stage in 1672. \"The Squire of\r\nAlsatia,\" by the same author, brought upon the stage in the eventful\r\nyear 1688, is a vivid picture of one of the wildest phases of London\r\nlife in those still rather primitive times. Alsatia, as every reader of\r\nWalter Scott knows, was a cant name for the White Friars, in London, a\r\nlocality which, at that time, was beyond the reach of the law and its\r\nofficers, a refuge for thieves and rogues, and especially for debtors,\r\nwhere they could either resist with no great fear of being overcome,\r\nor, when resistance was no longer possible, escape with ease. With such\r\na scene, and such people for characters, we are not surprised that the\r\nprinted edition of this play is prefaced by a vocabulary of the cant\r\nwords employed in it. The principal characters in the play are of the\r\nsame class with those which form the staple of all these old comedies.\r\nFirst there is a country father or uncle, who is rich and severe upon\r\nthe vices of youth, or arbitrary, or avaricious. He is here represented\r\nby sir William Belfond, \"a gentleman of about £3000 per annum, who in\r\nhis youth had been a spark of the town; but married and retired into\r\nthe country, where he turned to the other extreme--rigid, morose, most\r\nsordidly covetous, clownish, obstinate, positive, and forward.\" He must\r\nhave a London brother, or near relative, endowed with exactly contrary\r\nqualities, here represented by sir Edward Belfond, sir William's\r\nbrother, \"a merchant, who by lucky hits had gotten a great estate,\r\nlives single with ease and pleasure, reasonably and virtuously, a man\r\nof great humanity and gentleness and compassion towards mankind, well\r\nread in good books, possessed with all gentlemanlike qualities.\" Sir\r\nWilliam Belfond has two sons. Belfond senior, the eldest, is \"bred\r\nafter his father's rustic, swinish manner, with great rigour and\r\nseverity, upon whom his father's estate is entailed, the confidence\r\nof which makes him break out into open rebellion to his father, and\r\nbecome lewd, abominably vicious, stubborn, and obstinate.\" The younger\r\nBelfond, Sir William's second son, had been \"adopted by Sir Edward,\r\nand bred from his childhood by him, with all the tenderness and\r\nfamiliarity, and bounty, and liberty that can be;\" he was \"instructed\r\nin all the liberal sciences, and in all gentleman-like education;\r\nsomewhat given to women, and now and then to good fellowship; but\r\nan ingenious, well-accomplished gentleman; a man of honour, and of\r\nexcellent disposition and temper.\" Then we have some of the leading\r\nheroes of Alsatia, and first Cheatly, who is described as \"a rascal,\r\nwho by reason of debts, dares not stir out of Whitefryers, but there\r\ninveigles young heirs in tail; and helps 'em to goods and money upon\r\ngreat disadvantages; is bound for them, and shares with them, till he\r\nundoes them; a lewd, impudent, debauched fellow, very expert in the\r\ncant about the town.\" Shamwell is \"cousin to the Belfonds, an heir,\r\nwho, being ruined by Cheatly, is made a decoy-duck for others; not\r\ndaring to stay out of Alsatia, where he lives; is bound with Cheatly\r\nfor heirs, and lives upon them, a dissolute, debauch'd life.\" Another\r\nof these characters is captain Hackum, \"a block-headed bully of\r\nAlsatia; a cowardly, impudent, blustering fellow; formerly a sergeant\r\nin Flanders, run from his colours, retreating into Whitefryers for a\r\nvery small debt; where by the Alsatians he is dubb'd a captain; marries\r\none that lets lodgings, sells cherry-brandy, and is a bawd.\" Nor is\r\nAlsatia without a representative of the Puritanical part of society, in\r\nScrapeall, \"a hypocritical, repeating, praying, psalm-singing, precise\r\nfellow, pretending to great piety; a godly knave, who joins with\r\nCheatly, and supplies young heirs with goods and money.\" A rather large\r\nnumber of inferior characters fill up the canvas; and the females,\r\nwith two exceptions, belong to the same class. The plot of this play is\r\nvery simple. The elder son of sir William Belfond has taken to Alsatia,\r\nbut sir William, on his return from abroad, hearing talk of the fame of\r\na squire Belfond among the Alsatians, imagines that it is his younger\r\nson, and out of this mistake a considerable amount of misunderstanding\r\narises. At last sir William discovers his error, and finds his eldest\r\nson in Whitefryers, but the youth sets him at defiance. The father, in\r\ngreat anger, brings tipstaff constables, to take away his son by force;\r\nbut the Alsatians rise in force, the officers of the law are beaten,\r\nand sir William himself taken prisoner. He is rescued by the younger\r\nBelfond, and in the conclusion the elder brother becomes penitent, and\r\nis reconciled with his father. There is an underplot, far from moral\r\nin its character, which ends in the marriage of Belfond junior. It is\r\na busy, noisy play, and was a great favourite on the stage; but it is\r\nnow chiefly interesting as a vivid picture of London life in the latter\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century. \"Bury Fair,\" by Shadwell, is another\r\ncomedy of the same description; with little interest in the plot, but\r\nfull of life and movement. If \"The Squire of Alsatia\" was noisy, \"The\r\nScowrers,\" another comedy by the same author, first brought on the\r\nstage in 1691, was still more so. The wild and riotous gallants who,\r\nin former times of inefficient police regulation, infested the streets\r\nat night, and committed all sorts of outrages, were known at different\r\nperiods by a variety of names. In the reign of James I. and Charles\r\nI. they were the \"roaring boys;\" in the time of Shadwell, they were\r\ncalled the \"scowrers,\" because they scowered the streets at night, and\r\nrather roughly cleared them of all passengers; a few years later they\r\ntook the name of Mohocks, or Mohawks. During the night London lay at\r\nthe mercy of these riotous classes, and the streets witnessed scenes of\r\nbrutal violence, which, at the present day, we can hardly imagine. This\r\nstate of things is pictured in Shadwell's comedy. Sir William Rant,\r\nWildfire, and Tope, are noted scowrers, well known in the town, whose\r\nfame has excited emulation in men of less distinction in their way,\r\nWhachum, \"a city wit and scowrer, imitator of sir William,\" and \"two\r\nscoundrells,\" his companions, Bluster and Dingboy. Great enmity arises\r\nbetween the two parties of rival scowrers. The more serious characters\r\nin the play are Mr. Rant, sir William Rant's father, and sir Richard\r\nMaggot, \"a foolish Jacobite alderman\" (it must be remembered that we\r\nare now in the reign of king William). Sir Richard's wife, lady Maggot,\r\nlike the citizen's wives of the comedy of the Restoration generally,\r\nis a lady rather wanting in virtue, ambitious of mixing with the gay\r\nand fashionable world, and somewhat of a tyrant over her husband. She\r\nhas two handsome daughters, whom she seeks to keep confined from the\r\nworld, lest they should become her rivals. There are low characters\r\nof both sexes, who need not be enumerated. Much of the play is taken\r\nup with street rows, capital satirical pictures of London life. The\r\nplay ends with marriages, and with the reconciliation of sir William\r\nRant with his father, the serious old gentleman of the play. Shadwell\r\nexcelled in these busy comedies. One of the nearest approaches to him\r\nis Mountfort's comedy of \"Greenwich Park,\" which is another striking\r\nsatire on the looseness of London life at that time. As in the others,\r\nthe plot is simply nothing. The play consists of a number of intrigues,\r\nsuch as may be imagined, at a time when morality was little respected,\r\nin places of fashionable resort like Greenwich Park and Deptford Wells.\r\n\r\nAn element of satire was now introduced into English comedy which does\r\nnot appear to have belonged to it before--this was mimicry. Although\r\nthe principal characters in the play bore conventional names, they\r\nappear often to have been intended to represent individuals then well\r\nknown in society, and these individuals were caricatured in their\r\ndress, and mimicked in their language and manners. We are told that\r\nthis mimicry contributed greatly to the success of \"The Rehearsal,\"\r\nthe duke of Buckingham having taken incredible pains to make Lacy, who\r\nacted the part of Bayes, perfect in imitating the voice and manner\r\nof Dryden, whose dress and gait were minutely copied. This personal\r\nsatire was not always performed with impunity. On the 1st of February,\r\n1669, Pepys went to the Theatre Royal to see the performance of \"The\r\nHeiress,\" in which it appears that sir Charles Sedley was personally\r\ncaricatured, and the secretary of king Charles's admiralty has left\r\nin his diary the following entry:--\"To the king's house, thinking to\r\nhave seen the Heyresse, first acted on Saturday, but when we come\r\nthither we find no play there; Kynaston, that did act a part therein\r\nin abuse to sir Charles Sedley, being last night exceedingly beaten\r\nwith sticks by two or three that saluted him, so as he is mightily\r\nbruised, and forced to keep his bed.\" It is said that Dryden's comedy\r\nof \"Limberham,\" brought on the stage in 1678, was prohibited after the\r\nfirst night, because the character of Limberham was considered to be\r\ntoo open a satire on the duke of Lauderdale.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity in the comedies of the age of the Restoration was\r\ntheir extraordinary indelicacy. The writers seemed to emulate each\r\nother in presenting upon the stage scenes and language which no modest\r\near or pure mind could support. In the earlier period coarseness in\r\nconversation was characteristic of an unpolished age--the language put\r\nin the mouths of the actors, as remarked before, smelt of the tavern;\r\nbut under Charles II. the tone of fashionable society, as represented\r\non the stage, is modelled upon that of the brothel. Even the veiled\r\nallusion is no longer resorted to, broad and direct language is\r\nsubstituted in its place. This open profligacy of the stage reached its\r\ngreatest height between the years 1670 and 1680. The staple material\r\nof this comedy may be considered to be the commission of adultery,\r\nwhich is presented as one of the principal ornaments in the character\r\nof the well-bred gentleman, varied with the seducing of other men's\r\nmistresses, for the keeping of mistresses appears as the rule of\r\nsocial life. The \"Country Wife,\" one of Wycherley's comedies, which is\r\nsupposed to have been brought on the stage perhaps as early as 1672,\r\nis a mass of gross indecency from beginning to end. It involves two\r\nprincipal plots, that of a voluptuary who feigns himself incapable of\r\nlove and insensible to the other sex, in order to pursue his intrigues\r\nwith greater liberty; and that of a citizen who takes to his wife a\r\nsilly and innocent country girl, whose ignorance he believes will be\r\na protection to her virtue, but the very means he takes to prevent\r\nher, lead to her fall. The \"Parson's Wedding,\" by Thomas Killigrew,\r\nfirst acted in 1673, is equally licentious. The same at least may be\r\nsaid of Dryden's \"Limberham, or the Kind Keeper,\" first performed in\r\n1678, which, according to the author's own statement, was prohibited\r\non account of its freeness, but more probably because the character\r\nof Limberham was believed to be intended for a personal satire on the\r\nunpopular earl of Lauderdale. Its plot is simple enough; it is the\r\nstory of a debauched old gentleman, named Aldo, whose son, after a\r\nrather long absence on the Continent, returns to England, and assumes\r\nthe name of Woodall, in order to enjoy freely the pleasures of London\r\nlife before he makes himself known to his friends. He takes a lodging\r\nin a house occupied by some loose women, and there meets with his\r\nfather, but, as the latter does not recognise his son, they become\r\nfriends, and live together licentiously so long, that when the son at\r\nlength discovers himself, the old man is obliged to overlook his vices.\r\nOtway's comedy of \"Friendship in Fashion,\" performed the same year, was\r\nnot a whit more moral. But all these are far outdone by Ravenscroft's\r\ncomedy of \"The London Cuckolds,\" first brought out in 1682, which,\r\nnevertheless, continued to be acted until late in the last century. It\r\nis a clever comedy, full of action, and consisting of a great number\r\nof different incidents, selected from the less moral tales of the old\r\nstory-tellers as they appear in the \"Decameron\" of Boccaccio, among\r\nwhich that of the ignorant and uneducated young wife, similar to the\r\nplot of Wycherley's \"Country Wife,\" is again introduced.\r\n\r\nThe corruption of morals had become so great, that when women took\r\nup the pen, they exceeded in licentiousness even the other sex, as\r\nwas the case with Mrs. Behn. Aphra Behn is understood to have been\r\nborn at Canterbury, but to have passed some part of her youth in the\r\ncolony of Surinam, of which her father was governor. She evidently\r\npossessed a disposition for intrigue, and she was employed by the\r\nEnglish government, a few years after the Restoration, as a political\r\nspy at Antwerp. She subsequently settled in London, and gained a living\r\nby her pen, which was very prolific in novels, poems, and plays. It\r\nwould be difficult to point out in any other works such scenes of\r\nopen profligacy as those presented in Mrs. Behn's two comedies of\r\n\"Sir Patient Fancy\" and \"The City Heiress, or Sir Timothy Treat-all,\"\r\nwhich appeared in 1678 and 1681. Concealment of the slightest kind is\r\navoided, and even that which cannot be exposed to view, is tolerably\r\nbroadly described.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the performance of the \"London Cuckolds\" had been the\r\ncause of some scandal, and there were, even among play-goers, some who\r\ntook offence at such outrages on the ordinary feelings of modesty.\r\nThe excess of the evil had begun to produce a reaction. Ravenscroft,\r\nthe author of that comedy, produced on the stage, in 1684, a comedy,\r\nentitled \"Dame Dobson, or the Cunning Woman,\" which was intended to be\r\na modest play, but it was unceremoniously \"damned\" by the audience.\r\nThe prologue to this new comedy intimates that the \"London Cuckolds\"\r\nhad pleased the town and diverted the court, but that some \"squeamish\r\nfemales\" had taken offence at it, and that he had now written a \"dull,\r\ncivill\" play to make amends. They are addressed, therefore, in such\r\nterms as these:--\r\n\r\n          _In you, chaste ladies, then we hope to-day,\r\n          This is the poet's recantation play.\r\n          Come often to 't, that he at length may see\r\n          'Tis more than a pretended modesty.\r\n          Stick by him now, for if he finds you falter,\r\n          He quickly will his way of writing alter;\r\n          And every play shall send you blushing home,\r\n          For, though you rail, yet then we're sure you'll come._\r\n\r\nAnd it is further intimated,--\r\n\r\n          _A naughty play was never counted dull--\r\n          Nor modest comedy e'er pleased you much._\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" says Colley Cibber in his \"Apology,\" looking back to\r\nthese times, \"I remember the ladies were then observed to be decently\r\nafraid of venturing bare-faced to a new comedy, till they had been\r\nassured they might do it without the risk of an insult to their\r\nmodesty; or if their curiosity were too strong for their patience,\r\nthey took care at least to save appearances, and rarely came upon the\r\nfirst days of acting but in masks (then daily worn, and admitted in the\r\npit, the side boxes, and gallery), which custom, however, had so many\r\nill consequences attending it, that it has been abolished these many\r\nyears.\" According to the _Spectator_, ladies began now to desert the\r\ntheatre when comedies were brought out, except those who \"never miss\r\nthe first day of a new play, lest it should prove too luscious to admit\r\nof their going with any countenance to the second.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this abuse, there suddenly appeared a book which\r\ncreated at the time a great sensation. The comedies of the latter half\r\nof the seventeenth century were not only indecent, but they were filled\r\nwith profane language, and contained scenes in which religion itself\r\nwas treated with contempt. At that time there lived a divine of the\r\nChurch of England, celebrated for his Jacobitism--for I am now speaking\r\nof the reign of king William--for his talents as a controversial\r\nwriter, and for his zeal in any cause which he undertook. This was\r\nJeremy Collier, the author of several books of some merit, which are\r\nseldom read now, and who suffered for his zeal in the cause of king\r\nJames, and for his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to king\r\nWilliam. In the year 1698 Collier published his \"Short View of the\r\nImmorality and Profaneness of the English stage,\" in which he boldly\r\nattacked the licentiousness of the English comedy. Perhaps Collier's\r\nzeal carried him a little too far; but he had offended the wits, and\r\nespecially the dramatic poets, on all sides, and he was exposed to\r\nattacks from all quarters, in which Dryden himself took an active part.\r\nCollier showed himself fully capable of dealing with his opponents, and\r\nthe controversy had the effect of calling attention to the immoralities\r\nof the stage, and certainly contributed much towards reforming them.\r\nThey were become much less frequent and less gross at the opening of\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the reign of king Charles II., the stage was more\r\nlargely employed as a political agent, and under his successor, James\r\nII., the Puritans and the Whigs were constantly held up to scorn. After\r\nthe Revolution, the tables were turned, and the satire of the stage\r\nwas often aimed at Tories and Non-jurors. \"The Non-juror,\" by Colley\r\nCibber, which appeared in 1717, at a very opportune moment, gained for\r\nits author a pension and the office of poet-laureate. It was founded\r\nupon the \"Tartuffe\" of Molière, for the English comedy writers borrowed\r\nmuch from the foreign stage. A disguised priest, who passes under the\r\nname of Dr. Wolf, and who had been engaged in the rebellion of 1715,\r\nhas insinuated himself into the household of a gentleman of fortune, of\r\nnot very strong judgment, Sir John Woodvil, whom, under the title of a\r\nNon-juror, he has not only induced to become an abettor of rebels, but\r\nhe has persuaded him to disinherit his son, and he labours to seduce\r\nhis wife and to deceive his daughter. His baseness is exposed only just\r\nsoon enough to defeat his designs. Such a production as this could\r\nnot fail to give great offence to all the Jacobite party, of whatever\r\nshade, who were then rather numerous in London, and Cibber assures us\r\nthat his reward was a considerable amount of adverse criticism in every\r\nquarter where the Tory influence reached. His comedies were inferior in\r\nbrilliance of dialogue to those of the previous age, but the plots were\r\nwell imagined and conducted, and they are generally good acting plays.\r\n\r\nTo Samuel Foote, born in 1722, we owe the last change in the form and\r\ncharacter of English comedy. A man of infinite wit and humour, and\r\npossessed of extraordinary talent as a mimic, Foote made mimicry the\r\nprincipal instrument of his success on the stage. His plays are above\r\nall light and amusing; he reduced the old comedy of five acts to three\r\nacts, and his plots were usually simple, the dialogue full of wit and\r\nhumour; but their peculiar characteristic was their open boldness of\r\npersonal satire. It is entirely a comedy of his own. He sought to\r\ndirect his wit against all the vices of society, but this he did by\r\nholding up to ridicule and scorn the individuals who had in some way\r\nor other made themselves notorious by the practice of them. All his\r\nprincipal characters were real characters, who were more or less known\r\nto the public, and who were so perfectly mimicked on the stage in\r\ntheir dress, gait, and speech, that it was impossible to mistake them.\r\nThus, in \"The Devil upon Two Sticks,\" which is a general satire on the\r\nlow condition to which the practice of medicine had then fallen, the\r\npersonages introduced in it all represented quacks well known about the\r\ntown. \"The Maid of Bath\" dragged upon the stage scandals which were\r\nthen the talk of Bath society. The nabob of the comedy which bears\r\nthat title, had also his model in real life. \"The Bankrupt\" may be\r\nconsidered as a general satire on the baseness of the newspaper press\r\nof that day, which was made the means of propagating private scandals\r\nand libellous accusations in order to extort money, yet the characters\r\nintroduced are said to have been all portraits from the life; and the\r\nsame statement is made with regard to the comedy of \"The Author.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a drama of this inquisitorial character is a\r\ndangerous thing, and that it could hardly be allowed to exist where the\r\nrights of society are properly defined; and we are not surprised if\r\nFoote provoked a host of bitter enemies. But in some cases the author\r\nmet with punishment of a heavier and more substantial description.\r\nOne of the individuals introduced into \"The Maid of Bath,\" extorted\r\ndamages to the amount of £3,000. One of the persons who figured in\r\n\"The Author,\" obtained an order from the lord chamberlain for putting\r\na stop to the performance after it had had a short run; and the\r\nconsequences of \"The Trip to Calais,\" were still more disastrous.\r\nIt is well known that the character of lady Kitty Crocodile in that\r\nplay was a broad caricature on the notorious duchess of Kingston.\r\nThrough the treachery of some of the people employed by Foote, the\r\nduchess obtained information of the nature of this play before it was\r\nready for representation, and she had sufficient influence to obtain\r\nthe lord chamberlain's prohibition for bringing it on the stage. Nor\r\nwas this all, for as the play was printed, if not acted,--and it was\r\nsubsequently brought out in a modified form, with omission of the part\r\nof lady Kitty Crocodile, though the characters of some of her agents\r\nwere still retained,--infamous charges were got up against Foote, in\r\nretaliation, which caused him so much trouble and grief, that they are\r\nsaid to have shortened his days.\r\n\r\nThe drama which Samuel Foote had invented did not outlive him; its\r\ncaricature was itself transferred to the caricature of the print-shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n  CARICATURE IN HOLLAND.--ROMAIN DE HOOGHE.--THE ENGLISH\r\n     REVOLUTION.--CARICATURES ON LOUIS XIV. AND JAMES II.--DR.\r\n     SACHEVERELL.--CARICATURE BROUGHT FROM HOLLAND TO ENGLAND.--ORIGIN\r\n     OF THE WORD \"CARICATURE.\"--MISSISSIPPI AND THE SOUTH SEA; THE YEAR\r\n     OF BUBBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern political caricature, born, as we have seen, in France, may be\r\nconsidered to have had its cradle in Holland. The position of that\r\ncountry, and its greater degree of freedom, made it, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the general place of refuge to the political discontents of\r\nother lands, and especially to the French who fled from the tyranny of\r\nLouis XIV. It possessed at that time some of the most skilful artists\r\nand best engravers in Europe, and it became the central spot from which\r\nwere launched a multitude of satirical prints against that monarch's\r\npolicy, and against himself and his favourites and ministers. This was\r\nin a great measure the cause of the bitter hatred which Louis always\r\ndisplayed towards that country. He feared the caricatures of the Dutch\r\nmore than their arms, and the pencil and graver of Romain de Hooghe\r\nwere among the most effective weapons employed by William of Nassau.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of William with Mary, daughter of the duke of York, in\r\n1677, naturally gave the Dutch a greater interest than they could\r\nhave felt before in the domestic affairs of Great Britain, and a new\r\nstimulus to their zeal against Louis of France, or, which was the\r\nsame thing, against arbitrary power and Popery, both of which had\r\nbeen rendered odious under his name. The accession of James II. to\r\nthe throne of England, and his attempt to re-establish Popery, added\r\nreligious as well as political fuel to these feelings, for everybody\r\nunderstood that James was acting under the protection of the king\r\nof France. The very year of king James's accession, in 1685, the\r\ncaricature appeared which we have copied in our cut No. 186, and which,\r\nalthough the inscription is in English, appears to have been the work\r\nof a foreign artist. It was probably intended to represent Mary of\r\nModena, the queen of James II., and her rather famous confessor, father\r\nPetre, the latter under the character of the wolf among the sheep. Its\r\naim is sufficiently evident to need no explanation. At the top, in the\r\noriginal, are the Latin words, _Converte Angliam_, \"convert England,\"\r\nand beneath, in English, \"It is a foolish sheep that makes the wolf her\r\nconfessor.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 186. A Dangerous Confessor._]\r\n\r\nThe period during which the Dutch school of caricature flourished,\r\nextended through the reign of Louis XIV., and into the regency in\r\nFrance, and two great events, the revolution of 1688 in England, and\r\nthe wild money speculations of the year 1720, exercised especially the\r\npencils of its caricaturists. The first of these events belongs almost\r\nentirely to Romain de Hooghe. Very little is known of the personal\r\nhistory of this remarkable artist, but he is believed to have been born\r\ntowards the middle of the seventeenth century, and to have died in\r\nthe earlier years of the eighteenth century. The older French writers\r\non art, who were prejudiced against Romain de Hooghe for his bitter\r\nhostility to Louis XIV., inform us that in his youth he employed his\r\ngraver on obscene subjects, and led a life so openly licentious, that\r\nhe was banished from his native town of Amsterdam, and went to live\r\nat Haerlem. He gained celebrity by the series of plates, executed in\r\n1672, which represented the horrible atrocities committed in Holland by\r\nthe French troops, and which raised against Louis XIV. the indignation\r\nof all Europe. It is said that the prince of Orange (William III.\r\nof England), appreciating the value of his satire as a political\r\nweapon, secured it in his own interests by liberally patronising the\r\ncaricaturist; and we owe to Romain de Hooghe a succession of large\r\nprints in which the king of France, his _protégé_ James II., and the\r\nadherents of the latter, are covered with ridicule. One, published\r\nin 1688, and entitled \"Les Monarches Tombants,\" commemorates the\r\nflight of the royal family from England. Another, which appeared at\r\nthe same date, is entitled, in French, \"Arlequin fur l'hypogryphe à\r\nla croisade Loioliste,\" and in Dutch, \"Armeé van de Heylige League\r\nvoor der Jesuiten Monarchy\" (_i.e._ \"the army of the holy league for\r\nestablishing the monarchy of the Jesuits\"). Louis XIV. and James II.\r\nwere represented under the characters of Arlequin and Panurge, who are\r\nseated on the animal here called a \"hypogryphe,\" but which is really\r\na wild ass. The two kings have their heads joined together under one\r\nJesuit's cap. Other figures, forming part of this army of Jesuitism,\r\nare distributed over the field, the most grotesque of which is that\r\ngiven in our cut No. 187. Two personages introduced in some ridiculous\r\nposition or other, in most of these caricatures, are father Petre, the\r\nJesuit, and the infant prince of Wales, afterwards the old Pretender.\r\nIt was pretended that this infant was in fact the child of a miller,\r\nsecretly introduced into the queen's bed concealed in a warming-pan;\r\nand that this ingenious plot was contrived by father Petre. Hence the\r\nboy was popularly called Peterkin, or Perkin, _i.e._ little Peter,\r\nwhich was the name given afterwards to the Pretender in songs and\r\nsatires at the time of his rebellion; and in the prints a windmill\r\nwas usually given to the child as a sign of its father's trade. In\r\nthe group represented in our cut, father Petre, with the child in his\r\narms, is seated on a rather singular steed, a lobster. The young prince\r\nhere carries the windmill on his head. On the lobster's back, behind\r\nthe Jesuit, are carried the papal crown, surmounted by a fleur-de-lis,\r\nwith a bundle of relics, indulgences, &c., and it has seized in one\r\nclaw the English church service book, and in the other the book of the\r\nlaws of England. In the Dutch description of this print, the child is\r\ncalled \"the new born Antichrist.\" Another of Romain de Hooghe's prints,\r\nentitled \"Panurge secondé par Arlequin Deodaat à la croisade d'Irlande,\r\n1689,\" is a satire on king James's expedition to Ireland, which led to\r\nthe memorable battle of the Boyne. James and his friends are proceeding\r\nto the place of embarkation, and, as represented in our cut No. 188,\r\nfather Petre marches in front, carrying the infant prince in his arms.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 187. A Jesuit well Mounted._]\r\n\r\nThe drawing of Romain de Hooghe is not always correct, especially in\r\nhis larger subjects, which perhaps may be ascribed to his hasty and\r\ncareless manner of working; but he displays great skill in grouping\r\nhis figures, and great power in investing them with a large amount of\r\nsatirical humour. Most of the other caricatures of the time are poor\r\nboth in design and execution. Such is the case with a vulgar satirical\r\nprint which was published in France in the autumn of 1690, on the\r\narrival of a false rumour that king William had been killed in Ireland.\r\nIn the field of the picture the corpse of the king is followed by a\r\nprocession consisting of his queen and the principal supporters of\r\nhis cause. The lower corner on the left hand is occupied by a view of\r\nthe interior of the infernal regions, and king William introduced in\r\nthe place allotted to him among the flames. In different parts of the\r\npicture there are several inscriptions, all breathing a spirit of very\r\ninsolent exultation. One of them is the--\r\n\r\n                       _Billet d'Enterrement._\r\n\r\n     Vous estes priez d'assister au convoy, service, et enterrement\r\n     du tres haut, tres grand, et tres infame Prince infernal, grand\r\n     stadouter, des Armés diaboliques de la ligue d'Ausbourg, et\r\n     insigne usurpateur des Royaumes d'Angleterre, d'Eccosse, et\r\n     d'Irlande, décédé dans l'Irlande au mois d'Aoust 1690, qui se\r\n     fera le dit mois, dans sa paroisse infernale, ou assisteront Dame\r\n     Proserpine, Radamonte, et les Ligueurs.\r\n\r\n     Les Dames lui diront s'il leur plaist des injures.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 188. Off to Ireland._]\r\n\r\nThe prints executed in England at this time were, if possible, worse\r\nthan those published in France. Almost the only contemporary caricature\r\non the downfall of the Stuarts that I know, is an ill-executed print,\r\npublished immediately after the accession of William III., under the\r\ntitle, \"England's Memorial of its wonderful deliverance from French\r\nTyranny and Popish Oppression.\" The middle of the picture is occupied\r\nby \"the royal orange tree,\" which flourishes in spite of all the\r\nattempts to destroy it. At the upper corner, on the left side, is a\r\nrepresentation of the French king's \"council,\" consisting of an equal\r\nnumber of Jesuits and devils, seated alternately at a round table.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that the titles and inscriptions of nearly all\r\nthese caricatures are in Dutch, seems to show that their influence\r\nwas intended to be exercised in Holland rather than elsewhere. In\r\ntwo or three only of them these descriptions were accompanied with\r\ntranslations in English or French; and after a time, copies of them\r\nbegan to be made in England, accompanied with English descriptions. A\r\ncurious example of this is given in the fourth volume of the \"Poems\r\non State Affairs,\" printed in 1707. In the preface to this volume the\r\neditor takes occasion to inform the reader--\"That having procur'd\r\nfrom beyond sea a Collection of Satyrical Prints done in Holland and\r\nelsewhere, by Rom. de Hoog, and other the best masters, relating to\r\nthe French King and his Adherents, since he unjustly begun this war,\r\nI have persuaded the Bookseller to be at the expense of ingraving\r\nseveral of them; to each of which I have given the Explanation in\r\nEnglish verse, they being in Dutch, French, or Latin in the originals.\"\r\nCopies of seven of these caricatures are accordingly given at the end\r\nof the volume, which are certainly inferior in every respect to those\r\nof the best period of Romain de Hooghe. One of them commemorates the\r\neclipse of the sun on the 12th of May, 1706. The sun, as it might be\r\nconjectured, is Louis XIV., eclipsed by queen Anne, whose face occupies\r\nthe place of the moon. In the foreground of the picture, just under the\r\neclipse, the queen is seated on her throne under a canopy, surrounded\r\nby her counsellors and generals. With her left arm she holds down the\r\nGallic cock, while with the other hand she clips one of its wings\r\n(see our cut No. 189). In the upper corner on the right, is inserted\r\na picture of the battle of Ramillies, and in the lower corner on the\r\nleft, a sea-fight under admiral Leake, both victories gained in that\r\nyear. Another of these copies of foreign prints is given in our cut\r\nNo. 190. We are told that \"these figures represent a French trumpet and\r\ndrum, sent by Louis le Grand to enquire news of several citys lost by\r\nthe Mighty Monarch last campaign.\" The trumpeter holds in his hand a\r\nlist of lost towns, and another is pinned to the breast of the drummer;\r\nthe former list is headed by the names of \"Gaunt, Brussels, Antwerp,\r\nBruges,\" the latter by \"Barcelona.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 189. Clipping the Cock's Wings._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 190. Trumpet and Drum._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 191. The Three False Brethren._]\r\n\r\nThe first remarkable outburst of caricatures in England was caused by\r\nthe proceedings against the notorious Dr. Sacheverell in 1710. It is\r\nsomewhat curious that Sacheverell's partisans speak of caricatures\r\nas things brought recently from Holland, and new in England, and\r\nascribe the use of them as peculiar to the Whig party. The writer of\r\na pamphlet, entitled \"The Picture of Malice, or a true Account of Dr.\r\nSacheverell's Enemies, and their behaviour with regard to him,\" informs\r\nus that \"the chief means by which all the lower order of that sort of\r\nmen call'd Whigs, shall ever be found to act for the ruin of a potent\r\nadversary, are the following three--by the Print, the Canto or Doggrell\r\nPoem, and by the Libell, grave, calm, and cool, as the author of the\r\n'True Answer' describes it. These are not all employed at the same\r\ntime, any more than the ban and arierban of a kingdom is raised, unless\r\nto make sure work, or in cases of great exigency and imminent danger.\"\r\n\"The Print,\" he goes on to say, \"is originally a Dutch talisman\r\n(bequeathed to the ancient Batavians by a certain Chinese necromancer\r\nand painter), with a virtue far exceeding that of the Palladium, not\r\nonly of guarding their cities and provinces, but also of annoying their\r\nenemies, and preserving a due balance amongst the neighbouring powers\r\naround.\" This writer warms up so much in his indignation against this\r\nnew weapon of the Whigs, that he breaks out in blank verse to tell\r\nus how even the mysterious power of the magician did not destroy its\r\nvictims--\r\n\r\n          _Swifter than heretofore the Print effac'd\r\n          The pomp of mightiest monarchs, and dethron'd\r\n          The dread idea of royal majesty;\r\n          Dwindling the prince below the pigmy size.\r\n          Witness the once Great Louis in youthful pride,\r\n          And Charles of happy days, who both confess'd\r\n          The magic power of mezzotinto[101] shade,\r\n          And form grotesque, in manifestoes loud\r\n          Denouncing death to boor and burgomaster.\r\n          Witness, ye sacred popes with triple crown,\r\n          Who likewise victims fell to hideous print,\r\n          Spurn'd by the populace who whilome lay\r\n          Prostrate, and ev'n adored before your thrones._\r\n\r\n [101] The method of engraving called mezzotinto was very generally\r\n       adopted in England in the earlier part of the last century for\r\n       prints and caricatures. It was continued to rather a late period\r\n       by the publishing house of Carrington Bowles.\r\n\r\nWe are then told that \"this, if not the first, has yet been the chief\r\nmachine which his enemies have employ'd against the doctor; they have\r\nexposed him in the same piece with the pope and the devil, and who now\r\ncould imagine that any simple priest should be able to stand before a\r\npower which had levelled popes and monarchs?\" At least one copy of the\r\ncaricature here alluded to is preserved, although a great rarity, and\r\nit is represented in our cut No. 191. Two of the party remained long\r\nassociated together in the popular outcry, and as the name of the third\r\nfell into contempt and oblivion, the doctor's place in this association\r\nwas taken by a new cause of alarm, the Pretender, the child whom we\r\nhave just seen so joyously brandishing his windmill. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that this caricature greatly exasperated Sacheverell and the\r\nparty which supported him.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that the writer just quoted, in using the\r\nterm \"print,\" ignores altogether that of caricature, which, however,\r\nwas about this time beginning to come into use, although it is not\r\nfound in the dictionaries, I believe, until the appearance of that of\r\nDr. Johnson, in 1755. _Caricature_ is, of course, an Italian word,\r\nderived from the verb _caricare_, to charge or load; and therefore,\r\nit means a picture which is charged, or exaggerated (the old French\r\ndictionaries say, \"_c'est la même chose que charge en peinture_\").\r\nThe word appears not to have come into use in Italy until the latter\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century, and the earliest instance I know of\r\nits employment by an English writer is that quoted by Johnson from\r\nthe \"Christian Morals\" of Sir Thomas Brown, who died in 1682, but it\r\nwas one of his latest writings, and was not printed till long after\r\nhis death:--\"Expose not thyself by four-footed manners unto monstrous\r\ndraughts (_i.e._ drawings) and _caricatura_ representations.\" This very\r\nquaint writer, who had passed some time in Italy, evidently uses it as\r\nan exotic word. We find it next employed by the writer of the Essay No.\r\n537, of the \"Spectator,\" who, speaking of the way in which different\r\npeople were led by feelings of jealousy and prejudice to detract from\r\nthe characters of others, goes on to say, \"From all these hands we\r\nhave such draughts of mankind as are represented in those burlesque\r\npictures which the Italians call _caricaturas_, where the art consists\r\nin preserving, amidst distorted proportions and aggravated features,\r\nsome distinguishing likeness of the person, but in such a manner as to\r\ntransform the most agreeable beauty into the most odious monster.\" The\r\nword was not fully established in our language in its English form of\r\n_caricature_ until late in the last century.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 192. Atlas._]\r\n\r\nThe subject of agitation which produced a greater number of caricatures\r\nthan any previous event was the wild financial scheme introduced into\r\nFrance by the Scottish adventurer, Law, and imitated in England in\r\nthe great South Sea Bubble. It would be impossible here, within our\r\nnecessary limits, to attempt to trace the history of these bubbles,\r\nwhich all burst in the course of the year 1720; and, in fact, it is a\r\nhistory of which few are ignorant. On this, as on former occasions, the\r\ngreat mass of the caricatures, especially those against the Mississippi\r\nscheme, were executed in Holland, but they are much inferior to the\r\nworks of Romain de Hooghe. In fact, so great was the demand for these\r\ncaricatures, that the publishers, in their eagerness for gain, not\r\nonly deluged the world with plates by artists of no talent, which were\r\nwithout point or interest, but they took old plates of any subject\r\nin which there was a multitude of figures, put new titles to them,\r\nand published them as satires on the Mississippi scheme; for people\r\nwere ready to take anything which represented a crowd as a satire on\r\nthe eagerness with which Frenchmen rushed into the share-market.\r\nOne or two curious instances of this deception might be pointed out.\r\nThus, an old picture, evidently intended to represent the meeting\r\nof a king and a nobleman, in the court of a palace, surrounded by\r\na crowd of courtiers, in the costume probably of the time of Henri\r\nIV., was republished as a picture of people crowding to the grand\r\nscene of stock-jobbing in Paris, the Rue Quinquenpoix; and the old\r\npicture of the battle between Carnival and Lent came out again, a\r\nlittle re-touched, under the Dutch title, \"Stryd tuszen de smullende\r\nBubbel-Heeren en de aanstaande Armoede,\" _i.e._, \"The battle between\r\nthe good-living bubble-lords and approaching poverty.\"\r\n\r\nBesides being issued singly, a considerable number of these prints\r\nwere collected and published in a volume, which is still met with not\r\nunfrequently, under the title \"Het groote Tafereel der Dwaasheid,\"\r\n\"The great picture of folly.\" One of this set of prints represents a\r\nmultitude of persons, of all ages and sexes, acting the part of Atlas\r\nin supporting on their backs globes, which, though made only of paper,\r\nhad become, through the agitation of the stock exchange, heavier than\r\ngold. Law himself (see our cut No. 192) stands foremost, and requires\r\nthe assistance of Hercules to support his enormous burthen. In the\r\nFrench verses accompanying this print, the writer says--\r\n\r\n          _Ami Atlas, on voit (sans conter vous et moi)\r\n          Faire l'Atlas partout des divers personnages,\r\n          Riche, pauvre, homme, femme, et sot et quasi-sage,\r\n          Valet, et paisan, le gueux s'eleve en roi._\r\n\r\nAnother of these caricatures represents Law in the character of Don\r\nQuixote, riding upon Sancho's donkey. He is hastening to his Dulcinia,\r\nwho waits for him in the _actie huis_ (action or share-house), towards\r\nwhich people are dragging the animal on which he is seated. The\r\ndevil (see our cut No. 193), sits behind Law, and holds up the ass's\r\ntail, while a shower of paper, in the form of shares in companies,\r\nis scattered around, and scrambled for by the eager _actionnaires_.\r\nIn front, the animal is laden with the money into which this paper\r\nhas been turned,--the box bears the inscription, \"_Bombarioos\r\nGeldkist_, 1720,\" \"Bombario's (Law's) gold chest;\" and the flag bears\r\nthe inscription, \"_Ik koom, ik koom, Dulcinia_,\" \"I come, I come,\r\nDulcinia.\" The best, perhaps, of this lot of caricatures is a large\r\nengraving by the well-known Picart, inserted among the Dutch collection\r\nwith explanations in Dutch and French, and which was re-engraved in\r\nLondon, with English descriptions and applications. It is a general\r\nsatire on the madness of the memorable year 1720. Folly appears as\r\nthe charioteer of Fortune, whose car is drawn by the representatives\r\nof the numerous companies which had sprung up at this time, most of\r\nwhich appear to be more or less unsound. Many of these agents have the\r\ntails of foxes, \"to show their policy and cunning,\" as the explanation\r\ninforms us. The devil is seen in the clouds above, blowing bubbles of\r\nsoap, which mix with the paper which Fortune is distributing to the\r\ncrowd. The picture is crowded with figures, scattered in groups, who\r\nare employed in a variety of occupations connected with the great folly\r\nof the day, one of which, as an example, is given in our cut No. 194.\r\nIt is a transfer of stock, made through the medium of a Jew broker.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 193. The Don Quixote of Finance._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 194. Transfer of Stock._]\r\n\r\nIt was in this bubble agitation that the English school of caricature\r\nbegan, and a few specimens are preserved, though others which are\r\nadvertised in the newspapers of that day, seem to be entirely lost. In\r\nfact, a very considerable portion of the caricature literature of a\r\nperiod so comparatively recent as the first half of the last century,\r\nappears to have perished; for the interest of these prints was in\r\ngeneral so entirely temporary that few people took any care to preserve\r\nthem, and few of them were very attractive as pictures. As yet, indeed,\r\nthese English prints are but poor imitations of the works of Picart\r\nand other continental artists. A pair of English prints, entitled\r\n\"The Bubbler's Mirrour,\" represents, one a head joyful at the rise in\r\nthe value of stock, the other, a similar head sorrowful at its fall,\r\nsurrounded in each case with lists of companies and epigrams upon them.\r\nThey are engraved in mezzotinto, a style of art supposed to have been\r\ninvented in England--its invention was ascribed to Prince Rupert--and\r\nat this time very popular. In the imprint of these last-mentioned\r\nplates, we are informed that they were \"Printed for Carington Bowles,\r\nnext y^e Chapter House, in St. Paul's Ch. Yard, London,\" a well-known\r\nname in former years, and even now one quite familiar to collectors,\r\nof this class of prints, especially. Of Carington Bowles we shall have\r\nmore to say in the next chapter. With him begins the long list of\r\ncelebrated English printsellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  ENGLISH CARICATURE IN THE AGE OF GEORGE II.--ENGLISH\r\n     PRINTSELLERS.--ARTISTS EMPLOYED BY THEM.--SIR ROBERT\r\n     WALPOLE'S LONG MINISTRY.--THE WAR WITH FRANCE.--THE NEWCASTLE\r\n     ADMINISTRATION.--OPERA INTRIGUES.--ACCESSION OF GEORGE III., AND\r\n     LORD BUTE IN POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the accession of George II., the taste for political caricatures\r\nincreased greatly, and they had become almost a necessity of social\r\nlife. At this time, too, a distinct English school of political\r\ncaricature had been established, and the print-sellers became more\r\nnumerous, and took a higher position in the commerce of literature\r\nand art. Among the earliest of these printsellers the name of Bowles\r\nstands especially conspicuous. Hogarth's burlesque on the Beggar's\r\nOpera, published in 1728, was \"printed for John Bowles, at the Black\r\nHorse, in Cornhill.\" Some copies of \"King Henry the Eighth and Anna\r\nBullen,\" engraved by the same great artist in the following year,\r\nbear the imprint of John Bowles; and others were \"printed for Robert\r\nWilkinson, Cornhill, Carington Bowles, in St. Paul's Church Yard, and\r\nR. Sayer, in Fleet Street.\" Hogarth's \"Humours of Southwark Fair\" was\r\nalso published, in 1733, by Carington and John Bowles. This Carington\r\nBowles was, perhaps, dead in 1755, for in that year the caricature\r\nentitled \"British Resentment\" bears the imprint, \"Printed for T.\r\nBowles, in St. Paul's Church Yard, and Jno. Bowles & Son, in Cornhill.\"\r\nJohn Bowles appears to have been the brother of the first Carington\r\nBowles in St. Paul's Churchyard, and a son named Carington succeeded to\r\nthat business, which, under him and his son Carington, and then as the\r\nestablishment of Bowles and Carver, has continued to exist within the\r\nmemory of the present generation. Another very celebrated printshop was\r\nestablished in Fleet Street by Thomas Overton, probably as far back\r\nas the close of the seventeenth century. On his death his business was\r\npurchased by Robert Sayers, a mezzotinto engraver of merit, whose name\r\nappears as joint publisher of a print by Hogarth in 1729. Overton is\r\nsaid to have been a personal friend of Hogarth. Sayers was succeeded in\r\nthe business by his pupil in mezzotinto engraving, named Laurie, from\r\nwhom it descended to his son, Robert H. Laurie, known in city politics,\r\nand it became subsequently the firm of Laurie and Whittle. This\r\nbusiness still exists at 53, Fleet Street, the oldest establishment\r\nin London for the publication of maps and prints. During the reign of\r\nthe second George, the number of publishers of caricatures increased\r\nconsiderably, and among others, we meet with the names of J. Smith, \"at\r\nHogarth's Head, Cheapside,\" attached to a caricature published August,\r\n1756; Edwards and Darly, \"at the Golden Acorn, facing Hungerford,\r\nStrand,\" who also published caricatures during the years 1756-7;\r\ncaricatures and burlesque prints were published by G. Bickham, May's\r\nBuildings, Covent Garden, and one, directed against the employment of\r\nforeign troops, and entitled \"A Nurse for the Hessians,\" is stated to\r\nhave been \"sold in May's Buildings, Covent Garden, where is 50 more;\"\r\n\"The Raree Show,\" published in 1762, was \"sold at Sumpter's Political\r\nPrint-shop, Fleet Street,\" and many caricatures on contemporary\r\ncostume, especially on the Macaronis, about the year 1772, were\r\n\"published by T. Bowen, opposite the Haymarket, Piccadilly.\" Sledge,\r\n\"printseller, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden,\" is also met with about\r\nthe middle of the last century. Among other burlesque prints, Bickham,\r\nof May's Buildings, issued a series of figures representing the various\r\ntrades, made up of the different tools, &c., used by each. The house\r\nof Carington Bowles, in St. Paul's Churchyard, produced an immense\r\nnumber of caricatures, during the last century and the present, and of\r\nthe most varied character, but they consisted more of comic scenes of\r\nsociety than of political subjects, and many of them were engraved in\r\nmezzotinto, and rather highly coloured. Among them were caricatures on\r\nthe fashions and foibles of the day, amusing accidents and incidents,\r\ncommon occurrences of life, characters, &., and they are frequently\r\naimed at lawyers and priests, and especially at monks and friars,\r\nfor the anti-Catholic feeling was strong in the last century. J.\r\nBrotherton, at No. 132, New Bond Street, published many of Bunbury's\r\ncaricatures; while the house of Laurie and Whittle gave employment\r\nespecially to the Cruikshanks. But perhaps the most extensive publisher\r\nof caricatures of them all was S. W. Fores, who dwelt first at No. 3,\r\nPiccadilly, but afterwards established himself at No. 50, the corner\r\nof Sackville Street, where the name still remains. Fores seems to have\r\nbeen most fertile in ingenious expedients for the extension of his\r\nbusiness. He formed a sort of library of caricatures and other prints,\r\nand charged for admission to look at them; and he afterwards adopted a\r\nsystem of lending them out in portfolios for evening parties, at which\r\nthese portfolios of caricatures became a very fashionable amusement\r\nin the latter part of the last century. At times, some remarkable\r\ncuriosity was employed to add to the attractions of his shop. Thus, on\r\ncaricatures published in 1790, we find the statement that, \"In Fores'\r\nCaricature Museum is the completest collection in the kingdom. Also\r\n_the head and hand of Count Struenzee_. Admittance, 1_s._\" Caricatures\r\nagainst the French revolutionists, published in 1793, bear imprints\r\nstating that they were \"published by S. W. Fores, No. 3, Piccadilly,\r\nwhere may be seen _a complete Model of the Guillotine_--admittance, one\r\nshilling.\" In some this model is said to be six feet high.\r\n\r\nAmong the artists employed by the print-publishers of the age of\r\nGeorge II., we still find a certain number of foreigners. Coypel, who\r\ncaricatured the opera in the days of Farinelli, and pirated Hogarth,\r\nbelonged to a distinguished family of French painters. Goupy, who\r\nalso caricatured the _artistes_ of the opera (in 1727), and Boitard,\r\nwho worked actively for Carington Bowles from 1750 to 1770, were also\r\nFrenchmen. Liotard, another caricaturist of the time of George II.,\r\nwas a native of Geneva. The names of two others, Vandergucht and\r\nVanderbank, proclaim them Dutchmen. Among the English caricaturists who\r\nworked for the house of Bowles, were George Bickham, the brother of\r\nthe printseller, John Collet, and Robert Dighton, with others of less\r\nrepute. R. Attwold, who published caricatures against admiral Byng in\r\n1750, was an imitator of Hogarth. Among the more obscure caricaturists\r\nof the latter part of the half-century, were MacArdell--whose print\r\nof \"The Park Shower,\" representing the confusion raised among the\r\nfashionable company in the Mall in St. James's Park by a sudden fall\r\nof rain, is so well known--and Darley. Paul Sandby, who was patronised\r\nby the duke of Cumberland, executed caricatures upon Hogarth. Many of\r\nthese artists of the earlier period of the English school of caricature\r\nappear to have been very ill paid--the first of the family of Bowles is\r\nsaid to have boasted that he bought many of the plates for little more\r\nthan their value as metal. The growing taste for caricature had also\r\nbrought forward a number of amateurs, among whom were the countess of\r\nBurlington, and general, afterwards marquis, Townshend. The former, who\r\nwas the lady of that earl who built Burlington House, in Piccadilly,\r\nwas the leader of one of the factions in the opera disputes at the\r\nclose of the reign of George I., and is understood to have designed the\r\nwell-known caricature upon Cuzzoni, Farinelli, and Heidegger, which was\r\netched by Goupy, whom she patronised. It must not be forgotten that\r\nBunbury himself, as well as Sayers, were amateurs; and among other\r\namateurs I may name captain Minthull, captain Baillie, and John Nixon.\r\nThe first of these published caricatures against the Macaronis (as the\r\ndandies of the earlier part of the reign of George III. were called),\r\none of which, entitled \"The Macaroni Dressing-Room,\" was especially\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 195. A Party of Mourners._]\r\n\r\nEnglish political caricature came into its full activity with the\r\nministry of Sir Robert Walpole, which, beginning in 1721, lasted\r\nthrough the long period of twenty years. In the previous period\r\nthe Whigs were accused of having invented caricature, but now the\r\nTories certainly took the utmost advantage of the invention, for,\r\nduring several years, the greater number of the caricatures which\r\nwere published were aimed against the Whig ministry. It is also a\r\nrather remarkable characteristic of society at this period, that the\r\nladies took so great an interest in politics, that the caricatures\r\nwere largely introduced upon fans, as well as upon other objects of\r\nan equally personal character. Moreover, the popular notion of what\r\nconstituted a caricature was still so little fixed, that they were\r\nusually called _hieroglyphics_, a term, indeed, which was not ill\r\napplied, for they were so elaborate, and so filled with mystical\r\nallusions, that now it is by no means easy to understand or appreciate\r\nthem. Towards the year 1739, there was a marked improvement in the\r\npolitical caricatures--they were better designed, and displayed more\r\ntalent, but still they required rather long descriptions to render them\r\nintelligible. One of the most celebrated was produced by the motion in\r\nthe House of Commons, Feb. 13, 1741, against the minister Walpole. It\r\nwas entitled \"The Motion,\" and was a Whig satire upon the opposition,\r\nwho are represented as driving so hurriedly and inconsiderately to\r\nobtain places, that they are overthrown before they reach their object.\r\nThe party of the opposition retaliated by a counter-caricature,\r\nentitled, \"The Reason,\" which was in some respects a parody upon the\r\nother, to which it was inferior in point and spirit. At the same time\r\nappeared another caricature against the ministry, under the title of\r\n\"The Motive.\" These provoked another, entitled, \"A Consequence of the\r\nMotion;\" which was followed the day after its publication by another\r\ncaricature upon the opposition, entitled, \"The Political Libertines;\r\nor, Motion upon Motion;\" while the opponents of the government also\r\nbrought out a caricature, entitled, \"The Grounds,\" a violent and rather\r\ngross attack upon the Whigs. Among other caricatures published on this\r\noccasion, one of the best was entitled, \"The Funeral of Faction,\"\r\nand bears the date of March 26, 1741. Beneath it are the words,\r\n\"Funerals performed by Squire S----s,\" alluding to Sandys, who was the\r\nmotion-maker in the House of Commons, and who thus brought on his party\r\na signal defeat. Among the chief mourners on this occasion are seen the\r\nopposition journals, _The Craftsman_, the creation of Bolingbroke and\r\nPulteney, the still more scurrilous _Champion_, _The Daily Post_, _The\r\nLondon and Evening Post_, and _The Common Sense Journal_. This mournful\r\ngroup is reproduced in our cut No. 195.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 196. British Resentment._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 197. Britannia in a New Dress._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 198. Caught by a Bait._]\r\n\r\nFrom this time there was no falling off in the supply of caricatures,\r\nwhich, on the contrary, seemed to increase every year, until\r\nthe activity of the pictorial satirists was roused anew by the\r\nhostilities with France in 1755, and the ministerial intrigues of\r\nthe two following years. The war, accepted by the English government\r\nreluctantly, and ill prepared for, was the subject of much discontent,\r\nalthough at first hopes were given of great success. One of the\r\ncaricatures, published in the middle of these early hopes, at a time\r\nwhen an English fleet lay before Louisbourg, in Canada, is entitled,\r\n\"British Resentment, or the French fairly coop'd at Louisbourg,\"\r\nand came from the pencil of the French artist Boitard. One of its\r\ngroups, representing the courageous English sailor and the despairing\r\nFrenchman, is given in our cut No. 196, and may serve as an example\r\nof Boitard's style of drawing. It became now the fashion to print\r\npolitical caricatures, in a diminished form, on cards, and seventy-five\r\nof these were formed into a small volume, under the title of \"A\r\nPolitical and Satirical History of the years 1756 and 1757. In a\r\nseries of seventy-five humorous and entertaining Prints, containing\r\nall the most remarkable Transactions, Characters, and Caricaturas of\r\nthose two memorable years.... London: printed for E. Morris, near St.\r\nPaul's.\" The imprints of the plates, which bear the dates of their\r\nseveral publications, inform us that they came from the well-known\r\nshop of \"Darly and Edwards, at the Acorn, facing Hungerford, Strand.\"\r\nThese caricatures begin with our foreign relations, and express the\r\nbelief that the ministers were sacrificing English interests to French\r\ninfluence. In one of them (our cut No. 197), entitled, \"England made\r\nodious, or the French Dressers,\" the minister, Newcastle, in the garb\r\nof a woman, and his colleague, Fox, have dressed Britannia in a new\r\nFrench robe, which does not fit her. She exclaims, \"Let me have my own\r\ncloathes. I cannot stir my arms in these; besides, everybody laughs at\r\nme.\" Newcastle replies, rather imperiously, \"Hussy, be quiet, you have\r\nno need to stir your arms--why, sure! what's here to do?\" While Fox, in\r\na more insinuating tone, offers her a fleur-de-lis, and says, \"Here,\r\nmadam, stick this in your bosom, next your heart.\" The two pictures\r\nwhich adorn the walls of the room represent an axe and a halter; and\r\nunderneath we read the lines,--\r\n\r\n          _And shall the substitutes of power\r\n            Our genius thus bedeck?\r\n          Let them remember there's an hour\r\n            Of quittance--then, ware neck._\r\n\r\nIn another print of this series, this last idea is illustrated more\r\nfully. It is aimed at the ministers, who were believed to be enriching\r\nthemselves at the expense of the nation, and is entitled, \"The Devil\r\nturned Bird-catcher.\" On one side, while Fox is greedily scrambling\r\nfor the gold, the fiend has caught him in a halter suspended to the\r\ngallows; on the other side another demon is letting down the fatal\r\naxe on Newcastle, who is similarly employed. The latter (see our cut\r\nNo. 198) is described as a \"Noddy catching at the bait, while the\r\nbird-catcher lets drop an axe.\" This implement of execution is a\r\nperfect picture of a guillotine, long before it was so notoriously in\r\nuse in France.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 199. British Idolatry._]\r\n\r\nThe third example of these caricatures which I shall quote is entitled\r\n\"The Idol,\" and has for its subject the extravagancies and personal\r\njealousies connected with the Italian opera. The rivalry between\r\nMingotti and Vanneschi was now making as much noise there as that of\r\nCuzzoni and Faustina some years before. The former acted arbitrarily\r\nand capriciously, and could with difficulty be bound to sing a few\r\ntimes during the season for a high salary: it is said, £2,000 for the\r\nseason. In the caricature to which I allude, this lady appears raised\r\nupon a stool, inscribed \"£2,000 per annum,\" and is receiving the\r\nworship of her admirers. Immediately before her an ecclesiastic is seen\r\non his knees, exclaiming, \"Unto thee be praise now and for evermore!\"\r\nIn the background a lady appears, holding up her pug-dog, then the\r\nfashionable pet, and addressing the opera favourite, \"'Tis only pug and\r\nyou I love.\" Other men are on their knees behind the ecclesiastic, all\r\npersons of distinction; and last comes a nobleman and his lady, the\r\nformer holding in his hand an order for £2,000, his subscription to the\r\nopera, and remarking, \"We shall have but twelve songs for all this\r\nmoney.\" The lady replies, with an air of contempt, \"Well, and enough\r\ntoo, for the paltry trifle.\" The idol, in return for all this homage,\r\nsings rather contemptuously--\r\n\r\n                    _Ra, ru, ra, rot ye,\r\n                    My name is Mingotti,\r\n                    If you worship me notti,\r\n                    You shall all go to potti._\r\n\r\nThe closing years of the reign of George II., under the vigorous\r\nadministration of the first William Pitt, witnessed a calm in the\r\ndomestic politics of the country, which presented a strange contrast\r\nto the agitation of the previous period. Faction seemed to have hidden\r\nits head, and there was comparatively little employment for the\r\ncaricaturist. But this calm lasted only a short time after that king's\r\ndeath, and the new reign was ushered in by indications of approaching\r\npolitical agitation of the most violent description, in which satirists\r\nwho had hitherto contented themselves with other subjects were tempted\r\nto embark in the strife of politics. Among these was Hogarth, whose\r\ndiscomforts as a political caricaturist we shall have to describe in\r\nour next chapter.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 200. Fox on Boots._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no name ever provoked a greater amount of caricature and\r\nsatirical abuse than that of Lord Bute, who, through the favour of\r\nthe Princess of Wales, ruled supreme at court during the first period\r\nof the reign of George III. Bute had taken into the ministry, as his\r\nconfidential colleague, Fox--the Henry Fox who became subsequently\r\nthe first Lord Holland, a man who had enriched himself enormously\r\nwith the money of the nation, and these two appeared to be aiming at\r\nthe establishment of arbitrary power in the place of constitutional\r\ngovernment. Fox was usually represented in the caricatures with the\r\nhead and tail of the animal represented by his name rather strongly\r\ndeveloped; while Bute was drawn, as a very bad pun upon his name, in\r\nthe garb of a Scotchman, wearing two large boots, or sometimes a single\r\nboot of still greater magnitude. In these caricatures Bute and Fox are\r\ngenerally coupled together. Thus, a little before the resignation of\r\nthe duke of Newcastle in 1762, there appeared a caricature entitled\r\n\"The State Nursery,\" in which the various members of the ministry, as\r\nit was then formed under Lord Bute's influence, are represented as\r\nengaged in childish games. Fox, as the whipper-in of parliamentary\r\nmajorities, is riding, armed with his whip, on Bute's shoulders (see\r\nour cut No. 200), while the duke of Newcastle performs the more menial\r\nservice of rocking the cradle. In the rhymes which accompany this\r\ncaricature, the first of these groups is described as follows (Fox was\r\ncommonly spoken of in satire by the title of Volpone)--\r\n\r\n                  _First you see old sly Volpone-y,\r\n                  Riding on the shoulders brawny\r\n                  Of the muckle favourite Sawny;\r\n                            Doodle, doodle, doo._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 201. Fanaticism in another Shape._]\r\n\r\nThe number of caricatures published at this period was very great, and\r\nthey were almost all aimed in one direction, against Bute and Fox,\r\nthe Princess of Wales, and the government they directed. Caricature,\r\nat this time, ran into the least disguised licence, and the coarsest\r\nallusions were made to the supposed secret intercourse between the\r\nminister and the Princess of Wales, of which perhaps the most harmless\r\nwas the addition of a petticoat to the boot, as a symbol of the\r\ninfluence under which the country was governed. In mock processions\r\nand ceremonies a Scotchman was generally introduced carrying the\r\nstandard of the boot and petticoat. Lord Bute, frightened at the amount\r\nof odium which was thus heaped upon him, fought to stem the torrent\r\nby employing satirists to defend the government, and it is hardly\r\nnecessary to state that among these mercenary auxiliaries was the great\r\nHogarth himself, who accepted a pension, and published his caricature\r\nentitled, \"The Times, Nov. 1,\" in the month of September, 1762. Hogarth\r\ndid not excel in political caricature, and there was little in this\r\nprint to distinguish it above the ordinary publications of a similar\r\ncharacter. It was the moment of negotiations for Lord Bute's unpopular\r\npeace, and Hogarth's satire is directed against the foreign policy of\r\nthe great ex-minister Pitt. It represents Europe in a state of general\r\nconflagration, and the flames already communicating to Great Britain.\r\nWhile Pitt is blowing the fire, Bute, with a party of soldiers and\r\nsailors zealously assisted by his favourite Scotchmen, is labouring\r\nto extinguish it. In this he is impeded by the interference of the\r\nduke of Newcastle, who brings a wheelbarrow full of _Monitors_ and\r\n_North Britons,_ the violent opposition journals, to feed the flames.\r\nThe advocacy of Bute's mercenaries, whether literary or artistic, did\r\nlittle service to the government, for they only provoked increased\r\nactivity among its opponents. Hogarth's caricature of \"The Times,\" drew\r\nseveral answers, one of the best of which was a large print entitled\r\n\"The Raree Show: a political contrast to the print of 'The Times,' by\r\nWilliam Hogarth.\" It is the house of John Bull which is here on fire,\r\nand the Scots are dancing and exulting at it. In the centre of the\r\npicture appears a great actors' barn, from an upper window of which\r\nFox thrusts out his head and points to the sign, representing Æneas\r\nand Dido entering the cave together, as the performance which was\r\nacting within. It is an allusion to the scandal in general circulation\r\nrelating to Bute and the princess, who, of course, were the Æneas and\r\nDido of the piece, and appear in those characters on the scaffold in\r\nfront, with two of Bute's mercenary writers, Smollett, who edited the\r\n_Briton_, and Murphy, who wrote in the _Auditor_, one blowing the\r\ntrumpet and the other beating the drum. Among the different groups\r\nwhich fill the picture, one, behind the actors' barn (see our cut No.\r\n201), is evidently intended for a satire on the spirit of religious\r\nfanaticism which was at this time spreading through the country.\r\nAn open-air preacher, mounted on a stool, is addressing a not very\r\nintellectual-looking audience, while his inspiration is conveyed to him\r\nin a rather vulgar manner by the spirit, not of good, but of evil.\r\n\r\nThe violence of this political warfare at length drove Lord Bute from\r\nat least ostensible power. He resigned on the 6th of April, 1763. One\r\nof the popular favourites at this time was the duke of Cumberland, the\r\nhero of Culloden, who was regarded as the leader of the opposition\r\nin the House of Lords. People now believed that it was the duke of\r\nCumberland who had overthrown \"the boot,\" and his popularity increased\r\non a sudden. The triumph was commemorated in several caricatures. One\r\nof these is entitled, \"The Jack-Boot kick'd down, or English Will\r\ntriumphant: a Dream.\" The duke of Cumberland, whip in hand, has kicked\r\nthe boot out of the house, exclaiming to a young man in tailor's\r\ngarb who follows him, \"Let me alone, Ned; I know how to deal with\r\nScotsmen. Remember Culloden.\" The youth replies, \"Kick hard, uncle,\r\nkeep him down. Let me have a kick too.\" Nearly the same group, using\r\nsimilar language, is introduced into a caricature of the same date,\r\nentitled, \"The Boot and the Blockhead.\" The youthful personage is no\r\ndoubt intended for Cumberland's nephew, Edward, duke of York, who was\r\na sailor, and was raised to the rank of rear-admiral, and who appears\r\nto have joined his uncle in his opposition to Lord Bute. The \"boot,\" as\r\nseen in our cut No. 202, is encircled with Hogarth's celebrated \"line\r\nof beauty,\" of which I shall have to speak more at length in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 202. The Overthrow of the Boot._]\r\n\r\nWith the overthrow of Bute's ministry, we may consider the English\r\nschool of caricature as completely formed and fully established. From\r\nthis time the names of the caricaturists are better known, and we shall\r\nhave to consider them in their individual characters. One of these,\r\nWilliam Hogarth, had risen in fame far above the group of the ordinary\r\nmen by whom he was surrounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n  HOGARTH.--HIS EARLY HISTORY.--HIS SETS OF PICTURES.--THE HARLOT'S\r\n     PROGRESS.--THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.--THE MARRIAGE A LA MODE.--HIS\r\n     OTHER PRINTS.--THE ANALYSIS OF BEAUTY, AND THE PERSECUTION ARISING\r\n     OUT OF IT.--HIS PATRONAGE BY LORD BUTE.--CARICATURE OF THE\r\n     TIMES.--ATTACKS TO WHICH HE WAS EXPOSED BY IT, AND WHICH HASTENED\r\n     HIS DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1697, William Hogarth was born in the city of\r\nLondon. His father, Richard Hogarth, was a London schoolmaster, who\r\nlaboured to increase the income derived from his scholars by compiling\r\nbooks, but with no great success. From his childhood, as he tells us\r\nin his \"Anecdotes\" of himself, the young Hogarth displayed a taste for\r\ndrawing, and especially for caricature; and, out of school, he appears\r\nto have been seldom without a pencil in his hand. The limited means\r\nof Richard Hogarth compelled him to take the boy from school at an\r\nearly age, and bind him apprentice to a steel-plate engraver. But this\r\noccupation proved little to the taste of one whose ambition rose much\r\nhigher; and when the term of his apprenticeship had expired, he applied\r\nhimself to engraving on copper; and, setting up on his own account, did\r\nconsiderable amount of work, first in engraving arms and shop-bills,\r\nand afterwards in designing and engraving book illustrations, none\r\nof which displayed any superiority over the ordinary run of such\r\nproductions. Towards 1728 Hogarth began to practice as a painter, and\r\nhe subsequently attended the academy of sir James Thornhill, in Covent\r\nGarden, where he became acquainted with that painter's only daughter,\r\nJane. The result was a clandestine marriage in 1730, which met the\r\ndisapproval and provoked the anger of the lady's father. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, sir James became convinced of the genius of his son-in-law,\r\nand a reconciliation was effected through the medium of lady Thornhill.\r\n\r\nAt this time Hogarth had already commenced that new style of design\r\nwhich was destined to raise him soon to a degree of fame as an artist\r\nfew men have ever attained. In his \"Anecdotes\" of himself, the\r\npainter has given us an interesting account of the motives by which\r\nhe was guided. \"The reasons,\" he says, \"which induced me to adopt\r\nthis mode of designing were, that I thought both writers and painters\r\nhad, in the historical style, totally overlooked that intermediate\r\nspecies of subjects which may be placed between the sublime and the\r\ngrotesque. I therefore wished to compose pictures on canvas similar\r\nto representations on the stage; and further hope that they will be\r\ntried by the same test, and criticised by the same criterion. Let it\r\nbe observed, that I mean to speak only of those scenes where the human\r\nspecies are actors, and these, I think, have not often been delineated\r\nin a way of which they are worthy and capable. In these compositions,\r\nthose subjects that will both entertain and improve the mind bid fair\r\nto be of the greatest public utility, and must therefore be entitled to\r\nrank in the highest class. If the execution is difficult (though that\r\nis but a secondary merit), the author has claim to a higher degree of\r\npraise. If this be admitted, comedy, in painting as well as writing,\r\nought to be allotted the first place, though _the sublime_, as it is\r\ncalled, has been opposed to it. Ocular demonstration will carry more\r\nconviction to the mind of a sensible man than all he would find in a\r\nthousand volumes, and this has been attempted in the prints I have\r\ncomposed. Let the decision be left to every unprejudiced eye; let the\r\nfigures in either pictures or prints be considered as players dressed\r\neither for the sublime, for genteel comedy or farce, for high or low\r\nlife. I have endeavoured to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer: my\r\npicture is my stage, and men and women my players, who, by means of\r\ncertain actions and gestures, are to exhibit _a dumb-show_.\"\r\n\r\nThe great series of pictures, indeed, which form the principal\r\nfoundation of Hogarth's fame, are comedies rather than caricatures,\r\nand noble comedies they are. Like comedies, they are arranged, by a\r\nseries of successive plates, in acts and scenes; and they represent\r\ncontemporary society pictorially, just as it had been and was\r\nrepresented on the stage in English comedy. It is not by delicacy\r\nor excellence of drawing that Hogarth excels, for he often draws\r\nincorrectly; but it is by his extraordinary and minute delineation of\r\ncharacter, and by his wonderful skill in telling a story thoroughly. In\r\neach of his plates we see a whole act of a play, in which nothing is\r\nlost, nothing glossed over, and, I may add, nothing exaggerated. The\r\nmost trifling object introduced into the picture is made to have such\r\nan intimate relationship with the whole, that it seems as if it would\r\nbe imperfect without it. The art of producing this effect was that in\r\nwhich Hogarth excelled. The first of Hogarth's great _suites_ of prints\r\nwas \"The Harlot's Progress,\" which was the work of the years 1733 and\r\n1734. It tells a story which was then common in London, and was acted\r\nmore openly in the broad face of society than at the present day; and\r\ntherefore the effect and consequent success were almost instantaneous.\r\nIt had novelty, as well as excellence, to recommend it. This series\r\nof plates was followed, in 1735, by another, under the title of \"The\r\nRake's Progress.\" In the former, Hogarth depicted the shame and ruin\r\nwhich attended a life of prostitution; in this, he represented the\r\nsimilar consequences which a life of profligacy entailed on the other\r\nsex. In many respects it is superior to the \"Harlot's Progress,\" and\r\nits details come more home to the feelings of people in general,\r\nbecause those of the prostitute's history are more veiled from the\r\npublic gaze. The progress of the spendthrift in dissipation and riot,\r\nfrom the moment he becomes possessed of the fruits of paternal avarice,\r\nuntil his career ends in prison and madness, forms a marvellous drama,\r\nin which every incident presents itself, and every agent performs his\r\npart, so naturally, that it seems almost beyond the power of acting.\r\nPerhaps no one ever pictured despair with greater perfection than it\r\nis shown in the face and bearing of the unhappy hero of this history,\r\nin the last plate but one of the series, where, thrown into prison\r\nfor debt, he receives from the manager of a theatre the announcement\r\nthat the play which he had written in the hope of retrieving somewhat\r\nof his position--his last resource--has been refused. The returned\r\nmanuscript and the manager's letter lie on the wretched table (cut No.\r\n203); while on the one side his wife reproaches him heartlessly with\r\nthe deprivations and sufferings which he has brought upon her, and\r\non the other the jailer is reminding him of the fact that the fees\r\nexacted for the slight indulgence he has obtained in prison are unpaid,\r\nand even the pot-boy refuses to deliver him his beer without first\r\nreceiving his money. It is but a step further to Bedlam, which, in the\r\nnext plate, closes his unblessed career.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 203. Despair._]\r\n\r\nTen years almost from this time had passed away before Hogarth gave to\r\nthe world his next grand series of what he called his \"modern moral\r\nsubjects.\" This was \"The Marriage _à la mode_,\" which was published in\r\nsix plates in 1745, and which fully sustained the reputation built upon\r\nthe \"Harlot's Progress\" and the \"Rake's Progress.\" Perhaps the best\r\nplate of the \"Marriage _à la mode_,\" is the fourth--the music scene--in\r\nwhich one principal group of figures especially arrests the attention.\r\nIt is represented in our cut No. 204. William Hazlitt has justly\r\nremarked upon it that, \"the preposterous, overstrained admiration of\r\nthe lady of quality; the sentimental, insipid, patient delight of the\r\nman with his hair in papers, and sipping his tea; the pert, smirking,\r\nconceited, half-distorted approbation of the figure next to him; the\r\ntransition to the total insensibility of the round face in profile, and\r\nthen to the wonder of the negro boy at the rapture of his mistress,\r\nform a perfect whole.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 204. Fashionable Society._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 205. An Old Maid and her Page._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 206. Loss and Gain._]\r\n\r\nIn the interval between these three great monuments of his talent,\r\nHogarth had published various other plates, belonging to much the same\r\nclass of subjects, and displaying different degrees of excellence. His\r\nengraving of \"Southwark Fair,\" published in 1733, which immediately\r\npreceded the \"Harlot's Progress,\" may be regarded almost as an attempt\r\nto rival the fairs of Gallot. \"The Midnight Modern Conversation\"\r\nappeared in the interval between the \"Harlot's Progress\" and the\r\n\"Rake's Progress;\" and three years after the series last mentioned, in\r\n1738, the engraving, remarkable equally in design and execution, of\r\nthe \"Strolling Actresses in a Barn,\" and the four plates of \"Morning,\"\r\n\"Noon,\" \"Evening,\" and \"Night,\" all full of choicest bits of humour.\r\nSuch is the group of the old maid and her footboy in the first of this\r\nseries (cut No. 205)--the former stiff and prudish, whose religion\r\nis evidently not that of charity; while the latter crawls after,\r\nshrinking at the same time under the effects of cold and hunger,\r\nwhich he sustains in consequence of the hard, niggardly temper of his\r\nmistress. Among the humorous events which fill the plate of \"Noon,\" we\r\nmay point to the disaster of the boy who has been sent to the baker's\r\nto fetch home the family dinner, and who, as represented in our cut No.\r\n206, has broken his pie-dish, and spilt its contents on the ground;\r\nand it is difficult to say which is expressed with most fidelity to\r\nnature--the terror and shame of the unfortunate lad, or the feeling\r\nof enjoyment in the face of the little girl who is feasting on the\r\nfragments of the scattered meal. In 1741 appeared the plate of \"The\r\nEnraged Musician.\" During this period Hogarth appears to have been\r\nhesitating between two subjects for his third grand pictorial drama.\r\nSome unfinished sketches have been found, from which it would seem\r\nthat, after depicting the miseries of a life of dissipation in either\r\nsex, he intended to represent the domestic happiness which resulted\r\nfrom a prudent and well-assorted marriage; but for some reason or\r\nother he abandoned this design, and gave the picture of wedlock in\r\na less amiable light, in his \"Marriage _à la mode_.\" The title was\r\nprobably taken from that of Dryden's comedy. In 1750 appeared \"The\r\nMarch to Finchley,\" in many respects one of Hogarth's best works. It\r\nis a striking exposure of the want of discipline, and the low _morale_\r\nof the English army under George II. Many amusing groups fill this\r\npicture, the scene of which is laid in Tottenham Court Road, along\r\nwhich the guards are supposed to be marching to encamp at Finchley, in\r\nconsequence of rumours of the approach of the Pretender's army in the\r\nRebellion of '45. The soldiers in front are moving on with some degree\r\nof order, but in the rear we see nothing but confusion, some reeling\r\nabout under the effects of liquor, and confounded by the cries of women\r\nand children, camp-followers, ballad-singers, plunderers, and the like.\r\nOne of the latter, as represented in our cut No. 207, is assisting a\r\nfallen soldier with an additional dose of liquor, while his pilfering\r\npropensities are betrayed by the hen screaming from his wallet, and by\r\nthe chickens following distractedly the cries of their parent.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 207. A brave Soldier._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 208. A Painter's Amusements._]\r\n\r\nHogarth presents a singular example of a satirist who suffered under\r\nthe very punishment which he inflicted on others. He made many personal\r\nenemies in the course of his labours. He had begun his career with a\r\nwell-known personal satire, entitled \"The Man of Taste,\" which was\r\na caricature on Pope, and the poet is said never to have forgiven\r\nit. Although the satire in his more celebrated works appears to us\r\ngeneral, it told upon his contemporaries personally; for the figures\r\nwhich act their parts in them were so many portraits of individuals\r\nwho moved in contemporary society, and who were known to everybody,\r\nand thus he provoked a host of enemies. It was like Foote's mimicry.\r\nHe was to an extraordinary degree vain of his own talent, and jealous\r\nof that of others in the same profession; and he spoke in terms of\r\nundisguised contempt of almost all artists, past or present. Thus, the\r\npainter introduced into the print of \"Beer Street,\" is said to be a\r\ncaricature upon John Stephen Liotard, one of the artists mentioned in\r\nthe last chapter. He thus provoked the hostility of the greatest part\r\nof his contemporaries in his own profession, and in the sequel had\r\nto support the full weight of their anger. When George II., who had\r\nmore taste for soldiers than pictures, saw the painting of the \"March\r\nto Finchley,\" instead of admiring it as a work of art, he is said to\r\nhave expressed himself with anger at the insult which he believed\r\nwas offered to his army; and Hogarth not only revenged himself by\r\ndedicating his print to the king of Prussia, by which it did become\r\na satire on the British army, but he threw himself into the faction\r\nof the prince of Wales at Leicester House. The first occasion for the\r\ndisplay of all these animosities was given in the year 1753, at the\r\nclose of which he published his \"Analysis of Beauty.\" Though far from\r\nbeing himself a successful painter of beauty, Hogarth undertook in\r\nthis work to investigate its principles, which he referred to a waving\r\nor serpentine line, and this he termed the \"line of beauty.\" In 1745\r\nHogarth had published his own portrait as the frontispiece to a volume\r\nof his collected works, and in one corner of the plate he introduced a\r\npainter's palette, on which was this waving line, inscribed \"The line\r\nof beauty.\" For several years the meaning of this remained either quite\r\na mystery, or was only known to a few of Hogarth's acquaintances, until\r\nthe appearance of the book just mentioned. Hogarth's manuscript was\r\nrevised by his friend, Dr. Morell, the compiler of the \"Thesaurus,\"\r\nwhose name became thus associated with the book. This work exposed\r\nits author to a host of violent attacks, and to unbounded ridicule,\r\nespecially from the whole tribe of offended artists. A great number of\r\ncaricatures upon Hogarth and his line of beauty appeared during the\r\nyear 1754, which show the bitterness of the hatred he had provoked;\r\nand to hold still further their terror over his head, most of them\r\nare inscribed with the words, \"To be continued.\" Among the artists\r\nwho especially signalised themselves by their zeal against him, was\r\nPaul Sandby, to whom we owe some of the best of these anti-Hogarthian\r\ncaricatures. One of these is entitled, \"A New Dunciad, done with a view\r\nof [fixing] the fluctuating ideas of taste.\" In the principal group\r\n(which is given in our cut No. 208), Hogarth is represented playing\r\nwith a _pantin_, or figure which was moved into activity by pulling a\r\nstring. The string takes somewhat the form of the line of beauty, which\r\nis also drawn upon his palette. This figure is described underneath the\r\npicture as \"a painter at the proper exercise of his taste.\" To his\r\nbreast is attached a card (the knave of hearts), which is described\r\nby a very bad pun as \"the fool of arts.\" On one side \"his genius\" is\r\nrepresented in the form of a black harlequin; while behind appears a\r\nrather jolly personage (intended, perhaps, for Dr. Morell), who, we\r\nare told, is one of his admirers. On the table are the foundations, or\r\nthe remains, of \"a house of cards.\" Near him is Hogarth's favourite\r\ndog, named Trump, which always accompanies him in these caricatures.\r\nAnother caricature which appeared at this time represents Hogarth on\r\nthe stage as a quack doctor, holding in his hand the line of beauty,\r\nand recommending its extraordinary qualities. This print is entitled\r\n\"A Mountebank Painter demonstrating to his admirers and subscribers\r\nthat crookedness is y^e most beautifull.\" Lord Bute, whose patronage at\r\nLeicester House Hogarth now enjoyed, is represented fiddling, and the\r\nblack harlequin serves as \"his puff.\" In the front a crowd of deformed\r\nand hump-backed people are pressing forwards (see our cut No. 209), and\r\nthe line of beauty fits them all admirably.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 209. The Line of Beauty exemplified._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 210. Piracy Exposed._]\r\n\r\nMuch as this famous line of beauty was ridiculed, Hogarth was not\r\nallowed to retain the small honour which seemed to arise from it\r\nundisputed. It was said that he had stolen the idea from an Italian\r\nwriter named Lomazzo, Latinised into Lomatius, who had enounced it in\r\na treatise on the Fine Arts, published in the sixteenth century.[102]\r\nIn another caricature by Paul Sandby, with a vulgar title which I will\r\nnot repeat, Hogarth is visited, in the midst of his glory, by the ghost\r\nof Lomazzo, carrying in one hand his treatise on the arts, and with his\r\nother holding up to view the line of beauty itself. In the inscriptions\r\non the plate, the principal figure is described as \"An author sinking\r\nunder the weight of his saturnine analysis;\" and, indeed, Hogarth's\r\nterror is broadly painted, while the volume of his analysis is resting\r\nheavily upon \"a strong support bent in the line of beauty by the mighty\r\nload upon it.\" Beside Hogarth stands \"his faithful pug,\" and behind\r\nhim \"a friend of the author endeavouring to prevent his sinking to his\r\nnatural lowness.\" On the other side stands Dr. Morell, or, perhaps,\r\nMr. Townley, the master of Merchant Taylors' School, who continued\r\nhis service in preparing the book for the press after Morell's death,\r\ndescribed as \"the author's friend and corrector,\" astonished at the\r\nsight of the ghost. The ugly figure on the left hand of the picture\r\nis described as \"Deformity weeping at the condition of her darling\r\nson,\" while the dog is \"a greyhound bemoaning his friend's condition.\"\r\nThis group is represented in our cut No. 210. The other caricatures\r\nwhich appeared at this time were two numerous to allow us to give a\r\nparticular description of them. The artist is usually represented,\r\nunder the influence of his line of beauty, painting ugly pictures from\r\ndeformed models, or attempting historical pictures in a style bordering\r\non caricature, or, on one occasion, as locked up in a mad-house, and\r\nallowed only to exercise his skill upon the bare walls. One of these\r\ncaricatures is entitled, in allusion to the title of one of his most\r\npopular prints, \"The Painter's March through Finchley, dedicated to the\r\nking of the gipsies, as an encourager of arts, &c.\" Hogarth appears in\r\nfull flight through the village, closely pursued by women and children,\r\nand animals in great variety, and defended only by his favourite dog.\r\n\r\n [102] It was translated into English by Richard Haydocke, under the\r\n       title of \"The Artes of Curious Paintinge, Carvinge, Buildinge,\"\r\n       fol. 1598. This is one of the earliest works on art in the\r\n       English language.\r\n\r\nWith the \"Marriage _à la mode_,\" Hogarth may be considered as having\r\nreached his highest point of excellence. The set of \"Industry and\r\nIdleness\" tells a good and useful moral story, but displays inferior\r\ntalent in design. \"Beer Street\" and \"Gin Lane\" disgust us by their\r\nvulgarity, and the \"Four Stages of Cruelty\" are equally repulsive\r\nto our feelings by the unveiled horrors of the scenes which are too\r\ncoarsely depicted in them. In the four prints of the proceedings at\r\nan election, which are the last of his pictures of this description,\r\npublished in 1754, Hogarth rises again, and approaches in some degree\r\nto his former elevation.\r\n\r\nIn 1757, on the death of his brother-in-law, John Thornhill, the office\r\nof sergeant-painter of all his Majesty's works became vacant, and it\r\nwas bestowed upon Hogarth, who, according to his own account, received\r\nfrom it an income of about £200 a-year. This appointment caused another\r\ndisplay of hostility towards him, and his enemies called him jeeringly\r\nthe king's chief panel painter. It was at this moment that a plan for\r\nthe establishment of an academy of the fine arts was agitated, which,\r\na few years later, came into existence under the title of the Royal\r\nAcademy, and Hogarth proclaimed so loud an opposition to this project,\r\nthat the old cry was raised anew, that he was jealous and envious of\r\nall his profession, and that he sought to stand alone as superior to\r\nthem all. It was the signal for a new onslaught of caricatures upon\r\nhimself and his line of beauty. Hitherto his assailants had been found\r\nchiefly among the artists, but the time was now approaching when he\r\nwas destined to thrust himself into the midst of a political struggle,\r\nwhere the attacks of a new class of enemies carried with them a more\r\nbitter sting.\r\n\r\nGeorge II. died on the 17th of October, 1760, and his grandson\r\nsucceeded him to the throne as George III. It appears evident that\r\nbefore this time Hogarth had gained the favour of lord Bute, who,\r\nby his interest with the princess of Wales, was all-powerful in the\r\nhousehold of the young prince. The painter had hitherto kept tolerably\r\nclear of politics in his prints, but now, unluckily for himself,\r\nhe suddenly rushed into the arena of political caricature. It was\r\ngenerally said that Hogarth's object was, by displaying his zeal in the\r\ncause of his patron, lord Bute, to obtain an increase in his pension;\r\nand he acknowledges himself that his object was gain. \"This,\" he says,\r\n\"being a period when war abroad and contention at home engrossed every\r\none's mind, prints were thrown into the background; and the stagnation\r\nrendered it necessary that I should do some _timed thing_ [the italics\r\nare Hogarth's] to recover my lost time, and stop a gap in my income.\"\r\nAccordingly he determined to attack the great minister, Pitt, who had\r\nthen recently been compelled to resign his office, and had gone over to\r\nthe opposition. It is said that John Wilkes, who had previously been\r\nHogarth's friend, having been privately informed of his design, went\r\nto the painter, expostulated with him, and, as he continued obstinate,\r\nthreatened him with retaliation. In September, 1762, appeared the print\r\nentitled \"The Times, No. I,\" indicating that it was to be followed by\r\na second caricature. The principal features of the picture are these:\r\nEurope is represented in flames, which are communicating to Great\r\nBritain, but lord Bute, with soldiers and sailors, and the assistance\r\nof Highlanders, is labouring to extinguish them, while Pitt is blowing\r\nthe fire, and the duke of Newcastle brings a barrowful of _Monitors_\r\nand _North Britons_, the violent journals of the popular party, to\r\nfeed it. There is much detail in the print which it is not necessary\r\nto describe. In fulfilment of his threat, Wilkes, in the number of\r\nthe _North Briton_ published on the Saturday immediately following\r\nthe publication of this print, attacked Hogarth with extraordinary\r\nbitterness, casting cruel reflections upon his domestic as well as his\r\nprofessional character. Hogarth, stung to the quick, retaliated by\r\npublishing the well-known caricature of Wilkes. Thereupon Churchill,\r\nthe poet, Wilkes's friend, and formerly the friend of Hogarth also,\r\npublished a bitter invective in verse against the painter, under the\r\ntitle of an \"Epistle to William Hogarth.\" Hogarth retaliated again:\r\n\"Having an old plate by me,\" he tells us, \"with some parts ready,\r\nsuch as a background and a dog, I began to consider how I could turn\r\nso much work laid aside to some account, so patched up a print of\r\nMaster Churchill in the character of a bear.\" The unfinished picture\r\nwas intended to be a portrait of Hogarth himself; the canonical bear,\r\nwhich represented Churchill, held a pot of porter in one hand, and\r\nin the other a knotted club, each knot labelled \"lie 1,\" \"lie 2,\" &c.\r\nThe painter, in his \"Anecdotes,\" exults over the pecuniary profit he\r\nderived from the extensive sale of these two prints.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 211. An Independent Draughtsman._]\r\n\r\nThe virulence of the caricaturists against Hogarth became on this\r\noccasion greater than ever. Parodies on his own works, sneers at his\r\npersonal appearance and manners, reflections upon his character, were\r\nall embodied in prints which bore such names as Hogg-ass, Hoggart,\r\nO'Garth, &c. Our cut No. 211 represents one of the caricature portraits\r\nof the artist. It is entitled \"Wm. Hogarth, Esq., drawn from the Life.\"\r\nHogarth wears the thistle on his hat, as the sign of his dependence on\r\nlord Bute. At his breast hangs his palette, with the line of beauty\r\ninscribed upon it. He holds behind his back a roll of paper inscribed\r\n\"Burlesque on L--d B--t.\" In his right hand he presents to view two\r\npictures, \"The Times,\" and the \"Portrait of Wilkes.\" At the upper\r\ncorner to the left is the figure of Bute, offering him in a bag a\r\npension of \"£300 per ann.\" Some of the allusions in this picture are\r\nnow obscure, but they no doubt relate to anecdotes well known at the\r\ntime. They receive some light from the following mock letters which are\r\nwritten at the foot of the plate:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Copy of a Letter from Mr. Hog-garth to Lord Mucklemon, w^{th}\r\n     his Lordship's Answer._\r\n\r\n     \"My Lord,--The enclosed is a design I intend to publish; you are\r\n     sensible it will not redound to your honour, as it will expose you\r\n     to all the world in your proper colours. You likewise know what\r\n     induced me to do this; but it is in y^r power to prevent it from\r\n     appearing in publick, which I would have you do immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                 \"WILL^M HOG-GARTH.\r\n\r\n     \"Mais^r Hog-garth,--By my saul, mon, I am sare troobled for what\r\n     I have done; I did na ken y^r muckle merit till noow; say na mair\r\n     aboot it; I'll mak au things easy to you, & gie you bock your\r\n     Pension.\r\n\r\n                                                 \"SAWNEY MUCKLEMON.\"\r\n\r\nIn an etching without a title, published at this time, and copied in\r\nour cut No. 212, the Hogarthian dog is represented barking from a\r\ncautious distance at the canonical bear, who appears to be meditating\r\nfurther mischief. Pugg stands upon his master's palette and the line of\r\nbeauty, while Bruin rests upon the \"Epistle to Wm. Hogarth,\" with the\r\npen and ink by its side. On the left, behind the dog, is a large frame,\r\nwith the words \"Pannel Painting\" inscribed upon it.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 212. Beauty and the Bear._]\r\n\r\nThe article by Wilkes in the _North Briton_, and Churchill's metrical\r\nepistle, irritated Hogarth more than all the hostile caricatures, and\r\nwere generally believed to have broken his heart. He died on the 26th\r\nof October, 1764, little more than a year after the appearance of the\r\nattack by Wilkes, and with the taunts of his political as well as his\r\nprofessional enemies still ringing in his ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n  THE LESSER CARICATURISTS OF THE REIGN OF GEORGE III.--PAUL\r\n     SANDBY.--COLLET; THE DISASTER, AND FATHER PAUL IN HIS\r\n     CUPS.--JAMES SAYER; HIS CARICATURES IN SUPPORT OF PITT, AND\r\n     HIS REWARD.--CARLO KHAN'S TRIUMPH.--BUNBURY; HIS CARICATURES\r\n     ON HORSEMANSHIP.--WOODWARD; GENERAL COMPLAINT.--ROWLANDSON'S\r\n     INFLUENCE ON THE STYLE OF THOSE WHOSE DESIGNS HE ETCHED.--JOHN KAY\r\n     OF EDINBURGH: LOOKING A ROCK IN THE FACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school of caricature which had grown amid the political agitation\r\nof the reigns of the two first Georges, gave birth to a number of men\r\nof greater talent in the same branch of art, who carried it to its\r\nhighest degree of perfection during that of George III. Among them are\r\nthe three great names of Gillray, Rowlandson, and Cruikshank, and a\r\nfew who, though second in rank to these, are still well remembered for\r\nthe talent displayed in their works, or with the effect they produced\r\non contemporaries. Among these the principal were Paul Sandby, John\r\nCollet, Sayer, Bunbury, and Woodward.\r\n\r\nSandby has been spoken of in the last chapter. He was not by profession\r\na caricaturist, but he was one of those rising artists who were\r\noffended by the sneering terms in which Hogarth spoke of all artists\r\nbut himself, and he was foremost among those who turned their satire\r\nagainst him. Examples of his caricatures upon Hogarth have already been\r\ngiven, sufficient to show that they display skill in composition as\r\nwell as a large amount of wit and humour. After his death, they were\r\nrepublished collectively, under the title, \"Retrospective Art, from the\r\nCollection of the late Paul Sandby, Esq., R.A.\" Sandby was, indeed, one\r\nof the original members of the Royal Academy. He was an artist much\r\nadmired in his time, but is now chiefly remembered as a topographical\r\ndraughtsman. He was a native of Nottingham, where he was born in\r\n1725,[103] and he died on the 7th of November, 1809.[104]\r\n\r\n [103] His death is usually placed, but erroneously, in 1732.\r\n\r\n [104] Sandby etched landscapes on steel, and in aquatinta, the latter\r\n       by a method peculiarly his own, besides painting in oil and\r\n       opaque colours. But his fame rests _mainly_ on being the founder\r\n       of the English school of _water-colour painting_, since he was\r\n       the first to show the capability of that material to produce\r\n       finished pictures, and to lead the way to the perfection in\r\n       effect and colour to which that branch of art has since attained.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 213. A Disaster._]\r\n\r\nJohn Collet, who also has been mentioned in a previous chapter, was\r\nborn in London in 1725, and died there in 1780. Collet is said to have\r\nbeen a pupil of Hogarth, and there is a large amount of Hogarthian\r\ncharacter in all his designs. Few artists have been more industrious\r\nand produced a greater number of engravings. He worked chiefly for\r\nCarrington Bowles, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and for Robert Sayers,\r\nat 53, Fleet Street. His prints published by Bowles were engraved\r\ngenerally in mezzotinto, and highly coloured for sale; while those\r\npublished by Sayers were usually line engravings, and sometimes\r\nremarkably well executed. Collet chose for his field of labour that\r\nto which Hogarth had given the title of comedy in art, but he did not\r\npossess Hogarth's power of delineating whole acts and scenes in one\r\npicture, and he contented himself with bits of detail and groups of\r\ncharacters only. His caricatures are rarely political--they are aimed\r\nat social manners and social vanities and weaknesses, and altogether\r\nthey form a singularly curious picture of society during an important\r\nperiod of the last century. The first example I give (No. 213) is taken\r\nfrom a line engraving, published by Sayers in 1776. At this time the\r\nnatural adornments of the person in both sexes had so far yielded to\r\nartificial ornament, that even women cut off their own hair in order to\r\nreplace it by an ornamental _peruque_, supporting a head-dress, which\r\nvaried from time to time in form and in extravagance. Collet has here\r\nintroduced to us a lady who, encountering a sudden and violent wind,\r\nhas lost all her upper coverings, and wig, cap, and hat are caught by\r\nher footman behind. The lady is evidently suffering under the feeling\r\nof shame; and hard by, a cottager and his wife, at their door, are\r\nlaughing at her discomfiture. A bill fixed against a neighbouring wall\r\nannounces \"A Lecture upon Heads.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the \"no-popery\" feeling ran very high. Four years\r\nafterwards it broke out violently in the celebrated lord Gordon riots.\r\nIt was this feeling which contributed greatly to the success of\r\nSheridan's comedy of \"The Duenna,\" brought out in 1775. Collet drew\r\nseveral pictures founded upon scenes in this play, one of which is\r\ngiven in our cut No. 214. It forms one of Carington Bowles's rather\r\nnumerous series of prints from designs by Collet, and represents the\r\nwell-known drinking scene in the convent, in the fifth scene of the\r\nthird act of \"The Duenna.\" The scene, it will be remembered, is \"a room\r\nin the priory,\" and the excited monks are toasting, among other objects\r\nof devotion, the abbess of St. Ursuline and the blue-eyed nun of St.\r\nCatherine's. The \"blue-eyed nun\" is, perhaps, the lady seen through the\r\nwindow, and the patron saint of her convent is represented in one of\r\nthe pictures on the wall. There is great spirit in this picture, which\r\nis entitled \"Father Paul in his Cups, or the Private Devotions of a\r\nConvent.\" It is accompanied with the following lines:--\r\n\r\n          _See with these friars how religion thrives,\r\n          Who love good living better than good lives;\r\n          Paul, the superior father, rules the roast,\r\n          His god's the glass, the blue-eyed nun his toast.\r\n          Thus priests consume what fearful fools bestow,\r\n          And saints' donations make the bumpers flow.\r\n          The butler sleeps--the cellar door is free--\r\n          This is a modern cloister's piety._\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 214. Father Paul in his Cups._]\r\n\r\nFrom Collet to Sayer we rush into the heat--I may say into the\r\nbitterness--of politics, for James Sayer is known, with very trifling\r\nexceptions, as a political caricaturist. He was the son of a captain\r\nof a merchant ship at Great Yarmouth, but was himself put to the\r\nprofession of an attorney. As, however, he was possessed of a moderate\r\nindependence, and appears to have had no great taste for the law, he\r\nneglected his business, and, with considerable talent for satire and\r\ncaricature, he threw himself into the political strife of the day.\r\nSayer was a bad draughtsman, and his pictures are produced more by\r\nlabour than by skill in drawing, but they possess a considerable\r\namount of humour, and were sufficiently severe to obtain popularity\r\nat a time when this latter character excused worse drawing even than\r\nthat of Sayer. He made the acquaintance and gained the favour of the\r\nyounger William Pitt, when that statesman was aspiring to power, and\r\nhe began his career as a caricaturist by attacking the Rockingham\r\nministry in 1782--of course in the interest of Pitt. Sayer's earliest\r\nproductions which are now known, are a series of caricature portraits\r\nof the Rockingham administration, that appear to have been given to\r\nthe public in instalments, at the several dates of April 6, May 14,\r\nJune 17, and July 3, 1782, and bear the name of C. Bretherton as\r\npublisher. He published his first veritable caricature on the occasion\r\nof the ministerial changes which followed the death of lord Rockingham,\r\nwhen lord Shelburne was placed at the head of the cabinet, and Fox\r\nand Burke retired, while Pitt became chancellor of the exchequer.\r\nThis caricature, which bears the title of \"Paradise Lost,\" and is, in\r\nfact, a parody upon Milton, represents the once happy pair, Fox and\r\nBurke, turned out of their paradise, the Treasury, the arch of the\r\ngate of which is ornamented with the heads of Shelburne, the prime\r\nminister, and Dunning and Barré, two of his staunch supporters, who\r\nwere considered to be especially obnoxious to Fox and Burke. Between\r\nthese three heads appear the faces of two mocking fiends, and groups\r\nof pistols, daggers, and swords. Beneath are inscribed the well-known\r\nlines of Milton--\r\n\r\n                      _To the eastern side\r\n          Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,\r\n          Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate\r\n          With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms!\r\n          Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon.\r\n          The world was all before them, where to choose\r\n          Their place of rest, and providence their guide.\r\n          They, arm in arm, with wand'ring steps, and slow,\r\n          Thro' Eden took their solitary way._\r\n\r\nNothing can be more lugubrious than the air of the two friends,\r\nFox and Burke, as they walk away, arm in arm, from the gate of the\r\nministerial paradise. From this time Sayer, who adopted all Pitt's\r\nvirulence towards Fox, made the latter a continual subject of his\r\nsatire. Nor did this zeal pass unrewarded, for Pitt, in power, gave the\r\ncaricaturist the not unlucrative offices of marshal of the court of\r\nexchequer, receiver of the sixpenny duties, and cursitor. Sayer was,\r\nin fact, Pitt's caricaturist, and was employed by him in attacking\r\nsuccessively the coalition under Fox and North, Fox's India Bill, and\r\neven, at a later period, Warren Hastings on his trial.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 215. A Contrast._]\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that Sayer was almost exclusively a political\r\ncaricaturist. The exceptions are a few prints on theatrical subjects,\r\nin which contemporary actors and actresses are caricatured, and a\r\nsingle subject from fashionable life. A copy of the latter forms our\r\ncut No. 215. It has no title in the original, but in a copy in my\r\npossession a contemporary has written on the margin in pencil that\r\nthe lady is Miss Snow and the gentleman Mr. Bird, no doubt well-known\r\npersonages in contemporary society. It was published on the 19th of\r\nJuly, 1783.\r\n\r\nOne of Sayer's most successful caricatures, in regard to the effect\r\nit produced on the public, was that on Fox's India Bill, published on\r\nthe 5th of September, 1783. It was entitled \"Carlo Khan's Triumphal\r\nEntry into Leadenhall Street,\" Carlo Khan being personified by Fox,\r\nwho is carried in triumph to the door of the India House on the back\r\nof an elephant, which presents the face of lord North. Burke, who had\r\nbeen the principal supporter of the bill in debate, appears in the\r\ncharacter of the imperial trumpeter, and leads the elephant on its way.\r\nOn a banner behind Carlo, the old inscription, \"The Man of the People,\"\r\nthe title popularly given to Fox, is erased, and the two Greek words,\r\nΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ \"king of kings,\" substituted in its place. From\r\na chimney above, the bird of ill omen croaks forth the doom of the\r\nambitious minister, who, it was pretended, aimed at making himself more\r\npowerful than the king himself; and on the side of the house just below\r\nwe read the words--\r\n\r\n     _The night-crow cried foreboding luckless time._--Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nHenry William Bunbury belonged to a more aristocratic class in society\r\nthan any of the preceding. He was the second son of sir William\r\nBunbury, Bart., of Mildenhall, in the county of Suffolk, and was\r\nborn in 1750. How he first took so zealously to caricature we have\r\nno information, but he began to publish before he was twenty-one\r\nyears of age. Bunbury's drawing was bold and often good, but he had\r\nlittle skill in etching, for some of his earlier prints, published\r\nin 1771, which he etched himself, are coarsely executed. His designs\r\nwere afterwards engraved by various persons, and his own style was\r\nsometimes modified in this process. His earlier prints were etched and\r\nsold by James Bretherton, who has been already mentioned as publishing\r\nthe works of James Sayer. This Bretherton was in some esteem as an\r\nengraver, and he also had a print-shop at 132, New Bond Street, where\r\nhis engravings were published. James had a son named Charles, who\r\ndisplayed great talent at an early age, but he died young. As early as\r\n1772, when the macaronis (the dandies of the eighteenth century) came\r\ninto fashion, James Bretherton's name appears on prints by Bunbury as\r\nthe engraver and publisher, and it occurs again as the engraver of\r\nhis print of \"Strephon and Chloe\" in 1801, which was published by\r\nFores. At this and a later period some of his designs were engraved\r\nby Rowlandson, who always transferred his own style to the drawings\r\nhe copied. A remarkable instance of this is furnished by a print of a\r\nparty of anglers of both sexes in a punt, entitled \"Anglers of 1811\"\r\n(the year of Bunbury's death). But for the name, \"H. Bunbury, del.,\"\r\nvery distinctly inscribed upon it, we should take this to be a genuine\r\ndesign by Rowlandson; and in 1803 Rowlandson engraved some copies of\r\nBunbury's prints on horsemanship for Ackermann, of the Strand, in which\r\nall traces of Bunbury's style are lost. Bunbury's style is rather\r\nbroadly burlesque.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 216. How to Travel on Two Legs in a Frost._]\r\n\r\nBunbury had evidently little taste for political caricature, and he\r\nseldom meddled with it. Like Collet, he preferred scenes of social\r\nlife, and humorous incidents of contemporary manners, fashionable\r\nor popular. He had a great taste for caricaturing bad or awkward\r\nhorsemanship or unmanageable horses, and his prints of such subjects\r\nwere numerous and greatly admired. This taste for equestrian pieces\r\nwas shown in prints published in 1772, and several droll series of\r\nsuch subjects appeared at different times, between 1781 and 1791,\r\none of which was long famous under the title of \"Geoffrey Gambado's\r\nHorsemanship.\" An example of these incidents of horsemanship is copied\r\nin our cut No. 216, where a not very skilful rider, with a troublesome\r\nhorse, is taking advantage of the state of the ground for accelerating\r\nlocomotion. It is entitled, \"How to travel on Two Legs in a Frost,\" and\r\nis accompanied with the motto, in Latin, \"_Ostendunt terris hunc tantum\r\nfata, neque ultra esse sinent_.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 217. Strephon and Chloe._]\r\n\r\nOccasionally Bunbury drew in a broader style of caricature, especially\r\nin some of his later works. Of our examples of this broader style, the\r\nfirst cut, No. 217, entitled \"Strephon and Chloe,\" is dated the 1st of\r\nJuly, 1801. It is the very acme of sentimental courtship, expressed\r\nin a spirit of drollery which could not easily be excelled. The next\r\ngroup (cut No. 218), from a similar print published on the 21st of\r\nJuly in the same year, is a no less admirable picture of overstrained\r\npoliteness. It is entitled in the original, \"The Salutation Tavern,\"\r\nprobably with a temporary allusion beyond the more apparent design of\r\nthe picture. Bunbury, as before stated, died in 1811. It is enough to\r\nsay that sir Joshua Reynolds used to express a high opinion of him as\r\nan artist.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 218. A Fashionable Salutation._]\r\n\r\nBunbury's prints rarely appeared without his name, and, except when\r\nthey had passed through the engraving of Rowlandson, are easily\r\nrecognised. No doubt his was considered a popular name, which was\r\nalmost of as much importance as the print itself. But a large\r\nmass of the caricatures published at the latter end of the last\r\ncentury and the beginning of the present, appeared anonymously, or\r\nwith imaginary names. Thus a political print, entitled \"The Modern\r\nAtlas,\" bears the inscription \"Mas^r Hook fecit;\" another entitled\r\n\"Farmer George delivered,\" has that of \"Poll Pitt del.\" \"Everybody\r\ndelin^{it},\" is inscribed on a caricature entitled \"The Lover's Leap;\"\r\nand one which appeared under the title of \"Veterinary Operations,\"\r\nis inscribed \"Giles Grinagain fect.\" Some of these were probably\r\nthe works of amateurs, for there appear to have been many amateur\r\ncaricaturists in England at that time. In a caricature entitled\r\n\"The Scotch Arms,\" published by Fores on the 3rd of January, 1787,\r\nwe find the announcement, \"Gentlemen's designs executed gratis,\"\r\nwhich means, of course, that Fores would publish the caricatures of\r\namateurs, if he approved them, without making the said amateurs pay\r\nfor the engraving. But also some of the best caricaturists of the\r\nday published much anonymously, and we know that this was the case\r\nto a very great extent with such artists as Cruikshank, Woodward,\r\n&c., at all events until such time as their names became sufficiently\r\npopular to be a recommendation to the print. It is certain that many\r\nof Woodward's designs were published without his name. Such was the\r\ncase with the print of which we give a copy in our cut No. 219, which\r\nwas published on the 5th of May, 1796, and which bears strongly the\r\nmarks of Woodward's style. The spring of this year, 1796, witnessed a\r\ngeneral disappointment at the failure of the negociations for peace,\r\nand therefore the necessity of new sacrifices for carrying on the war,\r\nand of increased taxation. Many clever caricatures appeared on this\r\noccasion, of which this by Woodward was one. Of course, when war was\r\ninevitable, the question of generals was a very important one, and\r\nthe caricaturist pretends that the greatest general of the age was\r\n\"General Complaint.\" The general appears here with an empty purse in\r\nhis right hand, and in his left a handful of papers containing a list\r\nof bankrupts, the statement of the budget, &c. Four lines beneath, in\r\nrather doggrel verse, explain the situation as follows:--\r\n\r\n      _Don't tell me of generals raised from mere boys,\r\n        Though, believe me, I mean not their laurel to taint;\r\n      But the general, I'm sure, that will make the most noise,\r\n        If the war still goes on, will be General Complaint._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 219. General Complaint._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 220. Desire._]\r\n\r\nThere was much of Bunbury's style in that of Woodward, who had a taste\r\nfor the same broad caricatures upon society, which he executed in a\r\nsimilar spirit. Some of the _suites_ of subjects of this description\r\nthat he published, such as the series of the \"Symptoms of the Shop,\"\r\nthose of \"Everybody out of town\" and \"Everybody in Town,\" and the\r\n\"Specimens of Domestic Phrensy,\" are extremely clever and amusing.\r\nWoodward's designs were also not unfrequently engraved by Rowlandson,\r\nwho, as usual, imprinted his own style upon them. A very good example\r\nof this practice is seen in the print of which we give a copy in our\r\ncut No. 220. Its title, in the original, is \"Desire,\" and the passion\r\nis exemplified in the case of a hungry schoolboy watching through a\r\nwindow a jolly cook carrying by a tempting plum-pudding. We are told in\r\nan inscription underneath: \"Various are the ways this passion might be\r\ndepicted; in this delineation the subjects chosen are simple--a hungry\r\nboy and a plum-pudding.\" The design of this print is stated to be\r\nWoodward's; but the style is altogether that of Rowlandson, whose name\r\nappears on it as the etcher. It was published by R. Ackermann, on the\r\n20th of January, 1800. Woodward is well known by his prolific pencil,\r\nbut we are so little acquainted with the man himself, that I cannot\r\nstate the date either of his birth or of his death.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _No. 221. Looking a Rock in the Face._]\r\n\r\nThere lived at this time in Edinburgh an engraver of some eminence in\r\nhis way, but whose name is now nearly forgotten, and, in fact, it does\r\nnot occur in the last edition of Bryan's \"Dictionary of Engravers.\"\r\nThis name was John Kay, which is found attached to prints, of which\r\nabout four hundred are known, with dates extending from 1784 to 1817.\r\nAs an engraver, Kay possessed no great talent, but he had considerable\r\nhumour, and he excelled in catching and delineating the striking\r\npoints in the features and gait of the individuals who then moved in\r\nEdinburgh Society. In fact, a large proportion of his prints consist of\r\ncaricature portraits, often several figures on the same plate, which is\r\nusually of small dimensions. Among them are many of the professors and\r\nother distinguished members of the university of Edinburgh. Thus one,\r\ncopied in our cut No. 221, represents the eminent old geologist, Dr.\r\nJames Hutton, rather astonished at the shapes which his favourite rocks\r\nhave suddenly taken. The original print is dated in 1787, ten years\r\nbefore Dr. Hutton's death. The idea of giving faces to rocks was not\r\nnew in the time of John Kay, and it has been frequently repeated. Some\r\nof these caricature portraits are clever and amusing, and they are at\r\ntimes very satirical. Kay appears to have rarely ventured on caricature\r\nof any other description, but there is one rare plate by him, entitled\r\n\"The Craft in Danger,\" which is stated in a few words pencilled on the\r\ncopy I have before me, to have been aimed at a cabal for proposing Dr.\r\nBarclay for a professorship in the university of Edinburgh. It displays\r\nno great talent, and is, in fact, now not very intelligible. The\r\nfigures introduced in it are evidently intended for rather caricatured\r\nportraits of members of the university engaged in the cabal, and are in\r\nthe style of Kay's other portraits.[105]\r\n\r\n [105] In the library of the British Museum there is a collection of\r\n       John Kay's works bound in two volumes quarto, with a title and\r\n       table of contents in manuscript, but whether it is one of a few\r\n       copies intended for publication, or whether it is merely the\r\n       collection of some individual, I am not prepared to say. It\r\n       contains 343 plates, which are stated to be all Kay's works down\r\n       to the year 1813, when this collection was made. \"The Craft in\r\n       Danger\" is not among them. I have before me a smaller, but a very\r\n       choice selection, of Kay's caricatures, the loan of which I owe\r\n       to the kindness of Mr. John Camden Hotten, of Piccadilly. I am\r\n       indebted to Mr. Hotten for many courtesies of this description,\r\n       and especially for the use of a very valuable collection of\r\n       caricatures of the latter part of the eighteenth century and\r\n       earlier part of the present, mounted in four large folio volumes,\r\n       which has been of much use to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n  GILLRAY.--HIS FIRST ATTEMPTS.--HIS CARICATURES BEGIN WITH THE\r\n     SHELBURNE MINISTRY.--IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS.--CARICATURES\r\n     ON THE KING; \"NEW WAY TO PAY THE NATIONAL DEBT.\"--ALLEGED\r\n     REASON FOR GILLRAY'S HOSTILITY TO THE KING.--THE KING AND THE\r\n     APPLE-DUMPLINGS.--GILLRAY'S LATER LABOURS.--HIS IDIOTCY AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1757 was born the greatest of English caricaturists,\r\nand perhaps of all caricaturists of modern times whose works are\r\nknown--James Gillray. His father, who was named like himself, James,\r\nwas a Scotchman, a native of Lanark, and a soldier, and, having\r\nlost one arm at the battle of Fontenoy, became an out-pensioner of\r\nChelsea Hospital. He obtained also the appointment of sexton at the\r\nMoravian burial-ground at Chelsea, which he held forty years, and it\r\nwas at Chelsea that James Gillray the younger was born. The latter,\r\nhaving no doubt shown signs of artistic talent, was put apprentice\r\nto letter-engraving; but after a time, becoming disgusted with this\r\nemployment, he ran away, and joined a party of strolling players,\r\nand in their company passed through many adventures, and underwent\r\nmany hardships. He returned, however to London, and received some\r\nencouragement as a promising artist, and obtained admission as a\r\nstudent in the Royal Academy--the then young institution to which\r\nHogarth had been opposed. Gillray soon became known as a designer and\r\nengraver, and worked in these capacities for the publishers. Among\r\nhis earlier productions, two illustrations of Goldsmith's \"Deserted\r\nVillage\" are spoken of with praise, as displaying a remarkable freedom\r\nof effect. For a long time after Gillray became known as a caricaturist\r\nhe continued to engrave the designs of other artists. The earliest\r\nknown caricature which can be ascribed to him with any certainty, is\r\nthe plate entitled \"Paddy on Horseback,\" and dated in 1779, when he\r\nwas twenty-two years of age. The \"horse\" on which Paddy rides is a\r\nbull; he is seated with his face turned to the tail. The subject of\r\nsatire is supposed to be the character then enjoyed by the Irish as\r\nfortune-hunters. The point, however, is not very apparent, and indeed\r\nGillray's earliest caricatures are tame, although it is remarkable\r\nhow rapidly he improved, and how soon he arrived at excellence. Two\r\ncaricatures, published in June and July, 1782, on the occasion of\r\nadmiral Rodney's victory, are looked upon as marking his first decided\r\nappearance in politics.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing characteristic of Gillray's style is, the wonderful\r\ntact with which he seizes upon the points in his subject open to\r\nridicule, and the force with which he brings those points out. In the\r\nfineness of his design, and in his grouping and drawing, he excels all\r\nthe other caricaturists. He was, indeed, born with all the talents of\r\na great historical painter, and, but for circumstances, he probably\r\nwould have shone in that branch of art. This excellence will be the\r\nmore appreciated when it is understood that he drew his picture with\r\nthe needle on the plate, without having made any previous sketch of\r\nit, except sometimes a few hasty outlines of individual portraits or\r\ncharacters scrawled on cards or scraps of paper as they struck him.\r\n\r\nSoon after the two caricatures on Rodney's naval victory, the\r\nRockingham administration was broken up by the death of its chief, and\r\nanother was formed under the direction of Lord Shelburne, from which\r\nFox and Burke retired, leaving in it their old colleague, Pitt, who\r\nnow deserted the Whig party in parliament. Fox and Burke became from\r\nthis moment the butt of all sorts of abuse and scornful satire from the\r\ncaricaturists, such as Sayer, and newspaper writers in the pay of their\r\nopponents; and Gillray, perhaps because it offered at that moment the\r\nbest chance of popularity and success, joined in the crusade against\r\nthe two ex-ministers and their friends. In one of his caricatures,\r\nwhich is a parody upon Milton, Fox is represented in the character of\r\nSatan, turning his back upon the ministerial Paradise, but looking\r\nenviously over his shoulder at the happy pair (Shelburne and Pitt) who\r\nare counting their money on the treasury table:--\r\n\r\n                          _Aside he turned\r\n            For envy, yet with jealous leer malign\r\n            Eyed them askance._\r\n\r\nAnother, also by Gillray, is entitled \"Guy Faux and Judas Iscariot,\"\r\nthe former represented by Fox, who discovers the desertion of his\r\nlate colleague, lord Shelburne, by the light of his lantern, and\r\nrecriminates angrily, \"Ah! what, I've found you out, have I? Who arm'd\r\nthe high priests and the people? Who betray'd his mas--?\" At this\r\npoint he is interrupted by a sneering retort from Shelburne, who is\r\ncarrying away the treasury bag with a look of great self-complacency,\r\n\"Ha, ha! poor Gunpowder's vexed! He, he, he!--Shan't have the bag, I\r\ntell you, old Goosetooth!\" Burke was usually caricatured as a Jesuit;\r\nand in another of Gillray's prints of this time (published Aug. 23,\r\n1782), entitled \"Cincinnatus in Retirement,\" Burke is represented as\r\ndriven into the retirement of his Irish cabin, where he is surrounded\r\nby Popish relics and emblems of superstition, and by the materials\r\nfor drinking whisky. A vessel, inscribed \"Relick No. 1., used by St.\r\nPeter,\" is filled with boiled potatoes, which Jesuit Burke is paring.\r\nThree imps are seen dancing under the table.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 222. A Strong Dose._]\r\n\r\nIn 1783 the Shelburne ministry itself was dissolved, and succeeded\r\nby the Portland ministry, in which Fox was secretary of state for\r\nforeign affairs, and Burke, paymaster of the forces, and Lord North,\r\nwho had joined the Whigs against lord Shelburne, now obtained office\r\nas secretary for the home department. Gillray joined warmly in the\r\nattacks on this coalition of parties, and from this time his great\r\nactivity as a caricaturist begins. Fox, especially, and Burke, still\r\nunder the character of a Jesuit, were incessantly held up to ridicule\r\nin his prints. In another year this ministry also was overthrown, and\r\nyoung William Pitt became established in power, while the ex-ministers,\r\nnow the opposition, had become unpopular throughout the country. The\r\ncaricature of Gillray followed them, and Fox and Burke constantly\r\nappeared under his hands in some ridiculous situation or other. But\r\nGillray was not a hired libeller, like Sayer and some of the lower\r\ncaricaturists of that time; he evidently chose his subjects, in some\r\ndegree independently, as those which offered him the best mark for\r\nridicule; and he had so little respect for the ministers or the court,\r\nthat they all felt his satire in turn. Thus, when the plan of national\r\nfortifications--brought forward by the duke of Richmond, who had\r\ndeserted the Whigs to be made a Tory minister, as master-general of\r\nthe ordnance--was defeated in the House of Commons in 1787, the best\r\ncaricature it provoked was one by Gillray, entitled \"Honi soit qui\r\nmal y pense,\" which represents the horror of the duke of Richmond at\r\nbeing so unceremoniously compelled to swallow his own fortifications\r\n(cut No. 222). It is lord Shelburne, who had now become marquis of\r\nLansdowne, who is represented as administering the bitter dose. Some\r\nmonths afterwards, in the famous impeachment against Warren Hastings,\r\nGillray sided warmly against the impeachers, perhaps partly because\r\nthese were Burke and his friends; yet several of his caricatures on\r\nthis affair are aimed at the ministers, and even at the king himself.\r\nLord Thurlow, who was a favourite with the king, and who supported the\r\ncause of Warren Hastings with firmness, after he had been deserted by\r\nPitt and the other ministers, was especially an object of Gillray's\r\nsatire. Thurlow, it will be remembered, was rather celebrated for\r\nprofane swearing, and was sometimes spoken of as the thunderer. One\r\nof the finest of Gillray's caricatures at this period, published on\r\nthe 1st of March, 1788, is entitled \"Blood on Thunder fording the Red\r\nSea,\" and represents Warren Hastings carried on chancellor Thurlow's\r\nshoulders through a sea of blood, strewed with the mangled corpses\r\nof Hindoos. As will be seen in our copy of the most important part of\r\nthis print (cut No. 223), the \"saviour of India,\" as he was called by\r\nhis friends, has taken care to secure his gains. A remarkably bold\r\ncaricature by Gillray against the government appeared on the 2nd of May\r\nin this year. It is entitled \"Market-Day--every man has his price,\" and\r\nrepresents a scene in Smithfield, where the horned cattle exposed for\r\nsale are the supporters of the king's ministry. Lord Thurlow, with his\r\ncharacteristic frown, appears as the principal purchaser. Pitt, and\r\nhis friend and colleague Dundas, are represented drinking and smoking\r\njovially at the window of a public-house. On one side Warren Hastings\r\nis riding off with the king in the form of a calf, which he has just\r\npurchased, for Hastings was popularly believed to have worked upon king\r\nGeorge's avarice by rich presents of diamonds. On another side, the\r\noverwhelming rush of the cattle is throwing over the van in which Fox,\r\nBurke, and Sheridan are driving. This plate deserves to be placed among\r\nGillray's finest works.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 223. Blood on Thunder._]\r\n\r\nGillray caricatured the heir to the throne with bitterness, perhaps\r\nbecause his dissipation and extravagance rendered him a fair subject\r\nof ridicule, and because he associated himself with Fox's party in\r\npolitics; but his hostility to the king is ascribed in part to personal\r\nfeelings. A large and very remarkable print by our artist, though his\r\nname was not attached to it, and one which displays in a special manner\r\nthe great characteristics of Gillray's style, appeared on the 21st of\r\nApril, 1786, just after an application had been made to the House of\r\nCommons for a large sum of money to pay off the king's debts, which\r\nwere very great, in spite of the enormous income then attached to the\r\ncrown. George was known as a careful and even a parsimonious man, and\r\nthe queen was looked upon generally as a mean and very avaricious\r\nwoman, and people were at a loss to account for this extraordinary\r\nexpenditure, and they tried to explain it in various ways which were\r\nnot to the credit of the royal pair. It was said that immense sums were\r\nspent in secret corruption to pave the way to the establishment of\r\narbitrary power; that the king was making large savings, and hoarding\r\nup treasures at Hanover; and that, instead of spending money on his\r\nfamily, he allowed his eldest son to run into serious difficulties\r\nthrough the smallness of his allowance, and thus to become an object of\r\npity to his French friend, the wealthy duc d'Orleans, who had offered\r\nhim relief. The caricature just mentioned, which is extremely severe,\r\nis entitled \"A new way to pay the National Debt.\" It represents the\r\nentrance to the treasury, from which king George and his queen, with\r\ntheir band of pensioners, are issuing, their pockets, and the queen's\r\napron, so full of money, that the coins are rolling out and scattering\r\nabout the ground. Nevertheless, Pitt, whose pockets also are full,\r\nadds to the royal treasures large bags of the national revenue, which\r\nare received with smiles of satisfaction. To the left, a crippled\r\nsoldier sits on the ground, and asks in vain for relief; while the\r\nwall above is covered with torn placards, on some of which may be\r\nread, \"God save the King;\" \"Charity, a romance;\" \"From Germany, just\r\narrived a large and royal assortment...;\" and \"Last dying speech of\r\nfifty-four malefactors executed for robbing a hen-roost.\" The latter\r\nis a satirical allusion to the notorious severity with which the most\r\ntrifling depredators on the king's private farm were prosecuted. In the\r\nbackground, on the right hand side of the picture, the prince appears\r\nin ragged garments, and in want of charity no less than the cripple,\r\nand near him is the duke of Orleans, who offers him a draft for\r\n£200,000. On the placards on the walls here we read such announcements\r\nas \"Economy, an old song;\" \"British property, a farce;\" and \"Just\r\npublished, for the benefit of posterity, the dying groans of Liberty;\"\r\nand one, immediately over the prince's head, bears the prince's\r\nfeathers, with the motto, \"Ich starve.\" Altogether this is one of the\r\nmost remarkable of Gillray's caricatures.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 224. Farmer George and his Wife._]\r\n\r\nThe parsimoniousness of the king and queen was the subject of\r\ncaricatures and songs in abundance, in which these illustrious\r\npersonages appeared haggling with their tradesmen, and making bargains\r\nin person, rejoicing in having thus saved a small sum of money. It\r\nwas said that George kept a farm at Windsor, not for his amusement,\r\nbut to draw a small profit from it. By Peter Pindar he is described\r\nas rejoicing over the skill he has shown in purchasing his live stock\r\nas bargains. Gillray seized greedily all these points of ridicule,\r\nand, as early as 1786, he published a print of \"Farmer George and his\r\nWife\" (see our cut No. 224), in which the two royal personages are\r\nrepresented in the very familiar manner in which they were accustomed\r\nto walk about Windsor and its neighbourhood. This picture appears to\r\nhave been very popular; and years afterwards, in a caricature on a\r\nscene in \"The School for Scandal,\" where, in the sale of the young\r\nprofligate's effects, the auctioneer puts up a family portrait, for\r\nwhich a broker offers five shillings, and Careless, the auctioneer,\r\nsays, \"Going for no more than one crown,\" the family piece is the\r\nwell-known picture of \"Farmer George and his Wife,\" and the ruined\r\nprodigal is the prince of Wales, who exclaims, \"Careless, knock down\r\nthe farmer.\"\r\n\r\nMany caricatures against the undignified meanness of the royal\r\nhousehold appeared during the years 1791 and 1792, when the king\r\npassed much of his time at his favourite watering-place, Weymouth;\r\nand there his domestic habits had become more and more an object of\r\nremark. It was said that, under the pretence of Weymouth being an\r\nexpensive place, and taking advantage of the obligations of the royal\r\nmail to carry parcels for the king free, he had his provisions brought\r\nto him by that conveyance from his farm at Windsor. On the 28th of\r\nNovember, 1791, Gillray published a caricature on the homeliness of\r\nthe royal household, in two compartments, in one of which the king\r\nis represented, in a dress which is anything but that of royalty,\r\ntoasting his muffins for breakfast; and in the other, queen Charlotte,\r\nin no less homely dress, though her pocket is overflowing with money,\r\ntoasting sprats for supper. In another of Gillray's prints, entitled\r\n\"Anti-saccharites,\" the king and queen are teaching their daughters\r\neconomy in taking their tea without sugar; as the young princesses show\r\nsome dislike to the experiment, the queen admonishes them, concluding\r\nwith the remark, \"Above all, remember how much expense it will save\r\nyour poor papa!\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 225. A Flemish Proclamation._]\r\n\r\nAccording to a story which seems to be authentic, Gillray's dislike\r\nof the king was embittered at this time by an incident somewhat\r\nsimilar to that by which George II. had provoked the anger of Hogarth.\r\nGillray had visited France, Flanders, and Holland, and he had made\r\nsketches, a few of which he engraved. Our cut No. 225 represents\r\na group from one of these sketches, which explains itself, and is\r\na fair example of Gillray's manner of drawing such subjects. He\r\naccompanied the painter Loutherbourg, who had left his native city\r\nof Strasburg to settle in England, and become the king's favourite\r\nartist, to assist him in making sketches for his great painting of\r\n\"The Siege of Valenciennes,\" Gillray sketching groups of figures\r\nwhile Loutherbourg drew the landscape and buildings. After their\r\nreturn, the king expressed a desire to see their sketches, and they\r\nwere placed before him. Loutherbourg's landscapes and buildings\r\nwere plain drawings, and easy to understand, and the king expressed\r\nhimself greatly pleased with them. But the king's mind was already\r\nprejudiced against Gillray for his satirical prints, and when he\r\nsaw his hasty and rough, though spirited sketches, of the French\r\nsoldiers, he threw them aside contemptuously, with the remark, \"I\r\ndon't understand these caricatures.\" Perhaps the very word he used was\r\nintended as a sneer upon Gillray, who, we are told, felt the affront\r\ndeeply, and he proceeded to retort by a caricature, which struck at\r\nonce at one of the king's vanities, and at his political prejudices.\r\nGeorge III. imagined himself a great connoisseur in the fine arts, and\r\nthe caricature was entitled \"A Connoisseur examining a Cooper.\" It\r\nrepresented the king looking at the celebrated miniature of Oliver\r\nCromwell, by the English painter, Samuel Cooper. When Gillray had\r\ncompleted this print, he is said to have exclaimed, \"I wonder if the\r\nroyal connoisseur will understand this!\" It was published on the 18th\r\nof June, 1792, and cannot have failed to produce a sensation at that\r\nperiod of revolutions. The king is made to exhibit a strange mixture\r\nof alarm with astonishment in contemplating the features of this\r\ngreat overthrower of kingly power, at a moment when all kingly power\r\nwas threatened. It will be remarked, too, that the satirist has not\r\noverlooked the royal character for domestic economy, for, as will be\r\nseen in our cut No. 226, the king is looking at the picture by the\r\nlight of a candle-end stuck on a \"save-all.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 226. A Connoisseur in Art._]\r\n\r\nFrom this time Gillray rarely let pass an opportunity of caricaturing\r\nthe king. Sometimes he pictured his awkward and undignified gait, as he\r\nwas accustomed to shuffle along the esplanade at Weymouth; sometimes\r\nin the familiar manner in which, in the course of his walks in the\r\nneighbourhood of his Windsor farm, he accosted the commonest labourers\r\nand cottagers, and overwhelmed them with a long repetition of trivial\r\nquestions--for king George had a characteristic manner of repeating his\r\nquestions, and of frequently giving the reply to them himself.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 227. Royal Affability._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 228. A Lesson in Apple Dumplings._]\r\n\r\n        _Then asks the farmer's wife, or farmer's maid,\r\n        How many eggs the fowls have laid;\r\n        What's in the oven, in the pot, the crock;\r\n        Whether 'twill rain or no, and what's o'clock;\r\n        Thus from poor hovels gleaning information,\r\n        To serve as future treasure for the nation._\r\n\r\nSo said Peter Pindar; and in this _rôle_ king George was represented\r\nnot unfrequently in satirical prints. On the 10th of February Gillray\r\nillustrated the quality of \"Affability\" in a picture of one of these\r\nrustic encounters. The king and queen, taking their walk, have arrived\r\nat a cottage, where a very coarse example of English peasantry is\r\nfeeding his pigs with wash. The scene is represented in our cut No.\r\n227. The vacant stare of the countryman betrays his confusion at the\r\nrapid succession of questions--\"Well, friend, where a' you going,\r\nhay?--What's your name, hay?--Where do you live, hay?--hay?\" In other\r\nprints the king is represented running into ludicrous adventures while\r\nhunting, an amusement to which he was extremely attached. One of the\r\nbest known of these has been celebrated equally by the pen of Peter\r\nPindar and by the needle of Gillray. It was said that one day while\r\nking George was following the chase, he came to a poor cottage, where\r\nhis usual curiosity was rewarded by the discovery of an old woman\r\nmaking apple dumplings. When informed what they were, he could not\r\nconceal his astonishment how the apples could have been introduced\r\nwithout leaving a seam in their covering. In the caricature by Gillray,\r\nfrom which we take our cut No. 228, the king is represented looking\r\nat the process of dumpling making through the window, inquiring\r\nin astonishment, \"Hay? hay? apple dumplings?--how get the apples\r\nin?--how? Are they made without seams?\" The story is told more fully\r\nin the following verses of Peter Pindar, which will serve as the best\r\ncommentary on the engraving:--\r\n\r\n                   _THE KING AND THE APPLE DUMPLING._\r\n\r\n        _Once on a time a monarch, tired with whooping,\r\n          Whipping and spurring,\r\n          Happy in worrying\r\n        A poor, defenceless, harmless buck\r\n          (The horse and rider wet as muck),\r\n        From his high consequence and wisdom stooping,\r\n          Enter'd through curiosity a cot,\r\n          Where sat a poor old woman and her pot._\r\n        _The wrinkled, blear-eyed, good old granny,\r\n          In this same cot, illum'd by many a cranny.\r\n        Had finish'd apple dumplings for her pot.\r\n          In tempting row the naked dumplings lay,\r\n          When lo! the monarch in his usual way\r\n        Like lightning spoke, \"What this? what this? what? what?\"\r\n        Then taking up a dumpling in his hand,\r\n        His eyes with admiration did expand,\r\n          And oft did majesty the dumpling grapple.\r\n        \"'Tis monstrous, monstrous hard, indeed?\" he cried;\r\n        \"What makes it, pray, so hard?\"--The dame replied,\r\n          Low curtseying, \"Please your majesty, the apple.\"\r\n        \"Very astonishing, indeed! strange thing!\"\r\n        Turning the dumpling round, rejoined the king;\r\n          \"'Tis most extraordinary then, all this is--\r\n          It beats Pinetti's conjuring all to pieces--\r\n        Strange I should never of a dumpling dream!\r\n        But, Goody, tell me where, where, where's the seam?\"\r\n        \"Sir, there's no seam,\" quoth she, \"I never knew\r\n        That folks did apple dumplings sew.\"\r\n        \"No!\" cried the staring monarch with a grin,\r\n        \"How, how the devil got the apple in?\"\r\n        On which the dame the curious scheme reveal'd\r\n        By which the apple lay so sly conceal'd,\r\n          Which made the Solomon of Britain start;\r\n        Who to the palace with full speed repair'd\r\n        And queen, and princesses so beauteous, scared,\r\n          All with the wonders of the dumpling art.\r\n        There did he labour one whole week, to show\r\n          The wisdom of an apple dumpling maker;\r\n        And lo! so deep was majesty in dough,\r\n          The palace seem'd the lodging of a baker!_\r\n\r\nGillray was not the only caricaturist who turned the king's weaknesses\r\nto ridicule, but none caricatured them with so little gentleness, or\r\nevidently with so good a will. On the 7th of March, 1796, the princess\r\nof Wales gave birth to a daughter, so well known since as the princess\r\nCharlotte. The king is said to have been charmed with his grandchild,\r\nand this sentiment appears to have been anticipated by the public, for\r\non the 13th of February, when the princess's accouchment was looked\r\nforward to with general interest, a print appeared under the title of\r\n\"Grandpapa in his Glory.\" In this caricature, which is given in our\r\ncut No. 229, king George, seated, is represented nursing and feeding\r\nthe royal infant in an extraordinary degree of homeliness. He is\r\nsinging the nursery rhyme--\r\n\r\n          _There was a laugh and a craw,\r\n            There was a giggling honey,\r\n          Goody good girl shall be fed,\r\n            But naughty girl shall have noney._\r\n\r\nThis print bears no name, but it is known to be by Woodward, though it\r\nbetrays an attempt to imitate the style of Gillray. Gillray was often\r\nimitated in this manner, and his prints were not unfrequently copied\r\nand pirated. He even at times copied himself, and disguised his own\r\nstyle, for the sake of gaining money.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 229. Grandfather George._]\r\n\r\nAt the period of the regency bill in 1789, Gillray attacked Pitt's\r\npolicy in that affair with great severity. In a caricature published\r\non the 3rd of January, he drew the premier in the character of an\r\nover-gorged vulture, with one claw fixed firmly on the crown and\r\nsceptre, and with the other seizing upon the prince's coronet, from\r\nwhich he is plucking the feathers. Among other good caricatures on this\r\noccasion, perhaps the finest is a parody on Fuseli's picture of \"The\r\nWeird Sisters,\" in which Dundas, Pitt, and Thurlow, as the sisters,\r\nare contemplating the moon, the bright side of whose disc represents\r\nthe face of the queen, and the other that of the king, overcast with\r\nmental darkness. Gillray took a strongly hostile view of the French\r\nrevolution, and produced an immense number of caricatures against the\r\nFrench and their rulers, and their friends, or supposed friends, in\r\nthis country, during the period extending from 1790 to the earlier\r\nyears of the present century. Through all the changes of ministry or\r\npolicy, he seems to have fixed himself strongly on individuals, and\r\nhe seldom ceased to caricature the person who had once provoked his\r\nattacks. So it was with the lord chancellor Thurlow, who became the\r\nbutt of savage satire in some of his prints which appeared in 1792,\r\nat the time when Pitt forced him to resign the chancellorship. Among\r\nthese is one of the boldest caricatures which he ever executed. It is a\r\nparody, fine almost to sublimity, on a well-known scene in Milton, and\r\nis entitled, \"Sin, Death, and the Devil.\" The queen, as Sin, rushes to\r\nseparate the two combatants, Death (in the semblance of Pitt) and Satan\r\n(in that of Thurlow). During the latter part of the century Gillray\r\ncaricatured all parties in turn, whether ministerial or opposition,\r\nwith indiscriminate vigour; but his hostility towards the party of\r\nFox, whom he persisted in regarding, or at least in representing,\r\nas unpatriotic revolutionists, was certainly greatest. In 1803 he\r\nworked energetically against the Addington ministry; and in 1806 he\r\ncaricatured that which was known by the title of \"All the Talents;\" but\r\nduring this later period of his life his labours were more especially\r\naimed at keeping up the spirit of his countrymen against the threats\r\nand designs of our foreign enemies. It was, in fact, the caricature\r\nwhich at that time met with the greatest encouragement.\r\n\r\nIn his own person, Gillray had lived a life of great irregularity, and\r\nas he grew older, his habits of dissipation and intemperance increased,\r\nand gradually broke down his intellect. Towards the year 1811 he\r\nceased producing any original works; the last plate he executed was a\r\ndrawing of Bunbury's, entitled \"A Barber's Shop in Assize Time,\" which\r\nis supposed to have been finished in the January of that year. Soon\r\nafterwards his mind sank into idiotcy, from which it never recovered.\r\nJames Gillray died in 1815, and was buried in St. James's churchyard,\r\nPiccadilly, near the rectory house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  GILLRAY'S CARICATURES ON SOCIAL LIFE.--THOMAS ROWLANDSON.--HIS EARLY\r\n     LIFE.--HE BECOMES A CARICATURIST.--HIS STYLE AND WORKS.--HIS\r\n     DRAWINGS.--THE CRUIKSHANKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGillray was, beyond all others, the great political caricaturist of\r\nhis age. His works form a complete history of the greater and more\r\nimportant portion of the reign of George III. He appears to have had\r\nless taste for general caricature, and his caricatures on social life\r\nare less numerous, and with a few exceptions less important, than\r\nthose which were called forth by political events. The exceptions are\r\nchiefly satires on individual characters, which are marked by the same\r\nbold style which is displayed in his political attacks. Some of his\r\ncaricatures on the extravagant costume of the time, and on its more\r\nprominent vices, such as the rage for gambling, are also fine, but his\r\nsocial sketches generally are much inferior to his other works.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the case with his contemporary, Thomas\r\nRowlandson, who doubtlessly stands second to Gillray, and may, in some\r\nrespects, be considered his equal. Rowlandson was born in the Old\r\nJewry in London, the year before that of the birth of Gillray, in the\r\nJuly of 1756. His father was a city merchant, who had the means to\r\ngive him a good education, but embarking rashly in some unsuccessful\r\nspeculations, he fell into reduced circumstances, and the son had to\r\ndepend upon the liberality of a relative. His uncle, Thomas Rowlandson,\r\nafter whom probably he was named, had married a French lady, a\r\nMademoiselle Chatelier, who was now a widow, residing in Paris, with\r\nwhat would be considered in that capital a handsome fortune, and she\r\nappears to have been attached to her English nephew, and supplied him\r\nrather freely with money. Young Rowlandson had shown at an early age\r\ngreat talent for drawing, with an especial turn for satire. As a\r\nschoolboy, he covered the margins of his books with caricatures upon\r\nhis master and upon his fellow-scholars, and at the age of sixteen he\r\nwas admitted a student in the Royal Academy in London, then in its\r\ninfancy. But he did not profit immediately by this admission, for his\r\naunt invited him to Paris, where he began and followed his studies in\r\nart with great success, and was remarked for the skill with which he\r\ndrew the human body. His studies from nature, while in Paris, are said\r\nto have been remarkably fine. Nor did his taste for satirical design\r\nfail him, for it was one of his greatest amusements to caricature the\r\nnumerous individuals, and groups of individuals, who must in that age\r\nhave presented objects of ridicule to a lively Englishman. During\r\nthis time his aunt died, leaving him all her property, consisting of\r\nabout £7,000 in money, and a considerable amount in plate and other\r\nobjects. The sudden possession of so much money proved a misfortune to\r\nyoung Rowlandson. He appears to have had an early love for gaiety, and\r\nhe now yielded to all the temptations to vice held out by the French\r\nmetropolis, and especially to an uncontrollable passion for gambling,\r\nthrough which he soon dissipated his fortune.\r\n\r\nBefore this, however, had been effected, Rowlandson, after having\r\nresided in Paris about two years, returned to London, and continued\r\nhis studies in the Royal Academy. But he appears for some years\r\nto have given himself up entirely to his dissipated habits, and\r\nto have worked only at intervals, when he was driven to it by the\r\nwant of money. We are told by one who was intimate with him, that,\r\nwhen reduced to this condition, he used to exclaim, holding up his\r\npencil, \"I have been playing the fool, but here is my resource!\"\r\nand he would then produce--with extraordinary rapidity--caricatures\r\nenough to supply his momentary wants. Most of Rowlandson's earlier\r\nproductions were published anonymously, but here and there, among\r\nlarge collections, we meet with a print, which, by companion of the\r\nstyle with that of his earliest known works, we can hardly hesitate\r\nin ascribing to him; and from these it would appear that he had begun\r\nwith political caricature, because, perhaps, at that period of great\r\nagitation, it was most called for, and, therefore, most profitable.\r\nThree of the earliest of the political caricatures thus ascribed to\r\nRowlandson belong to the year 1784, when he was twenty-eight years\r\nof age, and relate to the dissolution of parliament in that year,\r\nthe result of which was the establishment of William Pitt in power.\r\nThe first, published on the 11th of March, is entitled \"The Champion\r\nof the People.\" Fox is represented under this title, armed with the\r\nsword of Justice and the shield of Truth, combating the many-headed\r\nhydra, its mouths respectively breathing forth \"Tyranny,\" \"Assumed\r\nPrerogative,\" \"Despotism,\" \"Oppression,\" \"Secret Influence,\" \"Scotch\r\nPolitics,\" \"Duplicity,\" and \"Corruption.\" Some of these heads are\r\nalready cut off. The Dutchman, Frenchman, and other foreign enemies\r\nare seen in the background, dancing round the standard of \"Sedition.\"\r\nFox is supported by numerous bodies of English and Irishmen, the\r\nEnglish shouting, \"While he protects us, we will support him.\" The\r\nIrish, \"He gave us a free trade and all we asked; he shall have our\r\nfirm support.\" Natives of India, in allusion to his unsuccessful India\r\nBill, kneel by his side and pray for his success. The second of these\r\ncaricatures was published on the 26th of March, and is entitled \"The\r\nState Auction.\" Pitt is the auctioneer, and is represented as knocking\r\ndown with the hammer of \"prerogative\" all the valuable articles of\r\nthe constitution. The clerk is his colleague, Henry Dundas, who holds\r\nup a weighty lot, entitled, \"Lot 1. The Rights of the People.\" Pitt\r\ncalls to him, \"Show the lot this way, Harry--a'going, a'going--speak\r\nquick, or it's gone--hold up the lot, ye Dund-ass!\" The clerk replies\r\nin his Scottish accent, \"I can hould it na higher, sir.\" The Whig\r\nmembers, under the title of the \"chosen representers,\" are leaving\r\nthe auction room in discouragement, with reflections in their mouths,\r\nsuch as, \"Adieu to Liberty!\" \"Despair not!\" \"Now or never!\" While Fox\r\nstands firm in the cause, and exclaims--\"I am determined to bid with\r\nspirit for Lot 1; he shall pay dear for it that outbids me!\" Pitt's\r\nTory supporters are ranged under the auctioneer, and are called the\r\n\"hereditary virtuosis;\" and their leader, who appears to be the lord\r\nchancellor, addresses them in the words, \"Mind not the nonsensical\r\nbiddings of those common fellows.\" Dundas remarks, \"We shall get the\r\nsupplies by this sale.\" The third of these caricatures is dated on the\r\n31st of March, when the elections had commenced, and is entitled,\r\n\"The Hanoverian Horse and British Lion--a Scene in a new Play, lately\r\nacted in Westminster, with distinguished applause. Act 2nd, Scene\r\nlast.\" At the back of the picture stands the vacant throne, with the\r\nintimation, \"We shall resume our situation here at pleasure, _Leo\r\nRex_.\" In front, the Hanoverian horse, unbridled, and without saddle,\r\nneighs \"pre-ro-ro-ro-ro-rogative,\" and is trampling on the safeguard of\r\nthe constitution, while it kicks out violently the \"faithful commons\"\r\n(alluding to the recent dissolution of parliament). Pitt, on the back\r\nof the horse, cries, \"Bravo!--go it again!--I love to ride a mettled\r\nsteed; send the vagabonds packing!\" Fox appears on the other side of\r\nthe picture, mounted on the British lion, and holding a whip and bridle\r\nin his hand. He says to Pitt, \"Prithee, Billy, dismount before ye get a\r\nfall, and let some abler jockey take your seat;\" and the lion observes,\r\nindignantly, but with gravity, \"If this horse is not tamed, he will\r\nsoon be absolute king of our forest.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 230. Opera Beauties._]\r\n\r\nIf these prints are correctly ascribed to Rowlandson, we see him here\r\nfairly entered in the lists of political caricature, and siding with\r\nFox and the Whig party. He displays the same boldness in attacking\r\nthe king and his ministers which was displayed by Gillray--a boldness\r\nthat probably did much towards preserving the liberties of the country\r\nfrom what was no doubt a resolute attempt to trample upon them, at a\r\ntime when caricature formed a very powerful weapon. Before this time,\r\nhowever, Rowlandson's pencil had become practised in those burlesque\r\npictures of social life for which he became afterwards so celebrated.\r\nAt first he seems to have published his designs under fictitious names,\r\nand one now before me, entitled \"The Tythe Pig,\" bears the early date\r\nof 1786, with the name of \"Wigstead,\" no doubt an assumed one, which\r\nis found on some others of his early prints. It represents the country\r\nparson, in his own parlour, receiving the tribute of the tithe pig\r\nfrom an interesting looking farmer's wife. The name of Rowlandson,\r\nwith the date 1792, is attached to a very clever and humorous etching\r\nwhich is now also before me, entitled \"Cold Broth and Calamity,\" and\r\nrepresenting a party of skaters, who have fallen in a heap upon the\r\nice, which is breaking under their weight. It bears the name of Fores\r\nas publisher. From this time, and especially toward the close of the\r\ncentury, Rowlandson's caricatures on social life became very numerous,\r\nand they are so well known that it becomes unnecessary, nor indeed\r\nwould it be easy, to select a few examples which would illustrate all\r\nhis characteristic excellencies. In prints published by Fores at the\r\nbeginning of 1794, the address of the publisher is followed by the\r\nwords, \"where may be had all Rowlandson's works,\" which shows how\r\ngreat was his reputation as a caricaturist at that time. It may be\r\nstated briefly that he was distinguished by a remarkable versatility of\r\ntalent, by a great fecundity of imagination, and by a skill in grouping\r\nquite equal to that of Gillray, and with a singular ease in forming his\r\ngroups of a great number of figures. Among those of his contemporaries\r\nwho spoke of him with the highest praise were sir Joshua Reynolds and\r\nBenjamin West. It has been remarked, too, that no artist ever possessed\r\nthe power of Rowlandson of expressing so much with so little effort. We\r\ntrace a great difference in style between Rowlandson's earlier and his\r\nlater works; although there is a general identity of character which\r\ncannot be mistaken. The figures in the former show a taste for grace\r\nand elegance that is rare in his later works, and we find a delicacy\r\nof beauty in his females which he appears afterwards to have entirely\r\nlaid aside. An example of his earlier style in depicting female faces\r\nis furnished by the pretty farmer's wife, in the print of \"The Tythe\r\nPig,\" just alluded to; and I may quote as another example, an etching\r\npublished on the 1st of January, 1794, under the title of \"English\r\nCuriosity; or, the foreigner stared out of countenance.\" An individual,\r\nin a foreign costume, is seated in the front row of the boxes of a\r\ntheatre, probably intended for the opera, where he has become the\r\nobject of curiosity of the whole audience, and all eyes are eagerly\r\ndirected upon him. The faces of the men are rather coarsely grotesque,\r\nbut those of the ladies, two of which are given in our cut No. 230,\r\npossess a considerable degree of refinement. He appears, however,\r\nto have been naturally a man of no real refinement, who easily gave\r\nhimself up to low and vulgar tastes, and, as his caricature became more\r\nexaggerated and coarse, his females became less and less graceful,\r\nuntil his model of female beauty appears to have been represented\r\nby something like a fat oyster-woman. Our cut No. 231, taken from a\r\nprint in the possession of Mr. Fairholt, entitled, \"The Trumpet and\r\nBassoon,\" presents a good example of Rowlandson's broad humour, and of\r\nhis favourite models of the human face. We can almost fancy we hear the\r\ndifferent tones of this brace of snorers.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 231. The Trumpet and Bassoon._]\r\n\r\nA good example of Rowlandson's grotesques of the human figure is given\r\nin our cut No. 232, taken from a print published on the 1st of January,\r\n1796, under the title of \"Anything will do for an Officer.\" People\r\ncomplained of the mean appearance of the officers in our armies, who\r\nobtained their rank, it was pretended, by favour and purchase rather\r\nthan by merit; and this caricature is explained by an inscription\r\nbeneath, which informs us how \"Some school-boys, who were playing at\r\nsoldiers, found one of their number so ill-made, and so much under\r\nsize, that he would have disfigured the whole body if put into the\r\nranks. 'What shall we do with him?' asked one. 'Do with him?' says\r\nanother, 'why make an officer of him.'\" This plate is inscribed with\r\nhis name, \"Rowlandson fecit.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 232. A Model Officer._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 233. Antiquaries at Work._]\r\n\r\nAt this time Rowlandson still continued to work for Fores, but\r\nbefore the end of the century we find him working for Ackermann, of\r\nthe Strand, who continued to be his friend and employer during the\r\nrest of his life, and is said to have helped him generously in many\r\ndifficulties. In these, indeed, he was continually involved by his\r\ndissipation and thoughtlessness. Ackermann not only employed him in\r\netching the drawings of other caricaturists, especially of Bunbury,\r\nbut in furnishing illustrations to books, such as the several series\r\nof Dr. Syntax, the \"New Dance of Death,\" and others. Rowlandson's\r\nillustrations to editions of the older standard novels, such as \"Tom\r\nJones,\" are remarkably clever. In transferring the works of other\r\ncaricaturists to the copper, Rowlandson was in the habit of giving his\r\nown style to them to such a degree, that nobody would suspect that\r\nthey were not his own, if the name of the designer were not attached\r\nto them. I have given one example of this in a former chapter, and\r\nanother very curious one is furnished by a print now before me,\r\nentitled \"Anglers of 1811,\" which bears only the name \"H. Bunbury\r\ndel.,\" but which is in every particular a perfect example of the style\r\nof Rowlandson. During the latter part of his life Rowlandson amused\r\nhimself with making an immense number of drawings which were never\r\nengraved, but many of which have been preserved and are still found\r\nscattered through the portfolios of collectors. These are generally\r\nbetter finished than his etchings, and are all more or less burlesque.\r\nOur cut No. 233 is taken from one of these drawings, in the possession\r\nof Mr. Fairholt; it represents a party of antiquaries engaged\r\nin important excavations. No doubt the figures were intended for\r\nwell-known archæologists of the day.\r\n\r\nThomas Rowlandson died in poverty, in lodgings in the Adelphi, on the\r\n22nd of April, 1827.\r\n\r\nAmong the most active caricaturists of the beginning of the present\r\ncentury we must not overlook Isaac Cruikshank, even if it were only\r\nbecause the name has become so celebrated in that of his more talented\r\nson. Isaac's caricatures, too, were equal to those of any of his\r\ncontemporaries, after Gillray and Rowlandson. One of the earliest\r\nexamples which I have seen bearing the well-known initials, I. C.,\r\nwas published on the 10th of March, 1794, the year in which George\r\nCruikshank was born, and probably, therefore, when Isaac was quite\r\na young man. It is entitled \"A Republican Belle,\" and is an evident\r\nimitation of Gillray. In another, dated the 1st of November, 1795, Pitt\r\nis represented as \"The Royal Extinguisher,\" putting out the flame of\r\n\"Sedition.\" Isaac Cruikshank published many prints anonymously, and\r\namong the numerous caricatures of the latter end of the last century we\r\nmeet with many which have no name attached to them, but which resemble\r\nso exactly his known style, that we can hardly hesitate in ascribing\r\nthem to him. It will be remarked that in his acknowledged works he\r\ncaricatures the opposition; but perhaps, like other caricaturists of\r\nhis time, he worked privately for anybody who would pay him, and was\r\nas willing to work against the government as for it, for most of the\r\nprints which betray their author only by their style are caricatures\r\non Pitt and his measures. Such is the group given in our cut No. 234,\r\nwhich was published on the 15th of August, 1797, at a time when there\r\nwere loud complaints against the burthen of taxation. It is entitled\r\n\"Billy's Raree-Show; or, John Bull En-lighten'd,\" and represents Pitt,\r\nin the character of a showman, exhibiting to John Bull, and picking\r\nhis pocket while his attention is occupied with the show. Pitt, in\r\na true showman's style, says to his victim, \"Now, pray lend your\r\nattention to the enchanting prospect before you,--this is the prospect\r\nof peace--only observe what a busy scene presents itself--the ports are\r\nfilled with shipping, the quays loaded with merchandise, riches are\r\nflowing in from every quarter--this prospect alone is worth all the\r\nmoney you have got about you.\" Accordingly, the showman abstracts the\r\nsame money from his pocket, while John Bull, unconscious of the theft\r\nexclaims with surprise, \"Mayhap it may, master showman, but I canna zee\r\nony thing like what you mentions,--I zees nothing but a woide plain,\r\nwith some mountains and molehills upon't--as sure as a gun, it must be\r\nall behoind one of those!\" The flag of the show is inscribed, \"Licensed\r\nby authority, Billy Hum's grand exhibition of moving mechanism; or,\r\ndeception of the senses.\"\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 234. The Raree-Show._]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 235. Flight across the Herring Pond._]\r\n\r\nIn a caricature with the initials of I. C., and published on the 20th\r\nof June, 1797, Fox is represented as \"The Watchman of the State,\"\r\nironically, of course, for he is betraying the truth which he had\r\nostentatiously assumed, and absenting himself at the moment when his\r\nagents are putting the match to the train they have laid to blow up\r\nthe constitution. Yet Cruikshank's caricatures on the Irish union\r\nwere rather opposed to ministers. One of these, published on the 20th\r\nof June, 1800, is full of humour. It is entitled \"A Flight across the\r\nHerring Pond.\" England and Ireland are separated by a rough sea, over\r\nwhich a crowd of Irish \"patriots\" are flying, allured by the prospect\r\nof honours and rewards. On the Irish shore, a few wretched natives,\r\nwith a baby and a dog, are in an attitude of prayer, expostulating\r\nwith the fugitives,--\"Och, och! do not leave us--consider your old\r\nhouse, it will look like a big wallnut-shell without a kernel.\" On the\r\nEnglish shore, Pitt is holding open the \"Imperial Pouch,\" and welcoming\r\nthem,--\"Come on, my little fellows, there's plenty of room for you\r\nall--the budget is not half full.\" Inside the \"pouch\" appears a host\r\nof men covered with honours and dignities, one of whom says to the\r\nforemost of the Irish candidates for favour, \"Very snug and convenient,\r\nbrother, I allure you.\" Behind Pitt, Dundas, seated on a pile of public\r\noffices united in his person, calls out to the immigrants, \"If you've\r\nony consciences at a', here's enugh to satisfy ye a'.\" A portion of\r\nthis clever caricature is represented in our cut No. 235.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 236. A Case of Abduction._]\r\n\r\nThere is a rare caricature on the subject of the Irish union, which\r\nexhibits a little of the style of Isaac Cruikshank, and a copy of which\r\nis in the possession of Mr. Fairholt. From this I have taken merely\r\nthe group which forms our cut No. 236. It is a long print, dated on\r\nthe 1st of January, 1800, and is entitled \"The Triumphal entry of the\r\nUnion into London.\" Pitt, with a paper entitled \"Irish Freedom\" in his\r\npocket, is carrying off the young lady (Ireland) by force, with her\r\nnatural accompaniment, a keg of whisky. The lord chancellor of Ireland\r\n(lord Clare) sits on the horse and performs the part of fiddler.\r\nIn advance of this group are a long rabble of radicals, Irishman,\r\n&c., while close behind comes Grattan, carried in a sedan-chair, and\r\nearnestly appealing to the lady, \"Ierne, Ierne! my sweet maid, listen\r\nnot to him--he's a false, flattering, gay deceiver.\" Still farther in\r\nthe rear follows St. Patrick, riding on a bull, with a sack of potatoes\r\nfor his saddle, and playing on the Irish harp. An Irishman expostulates\r\nin the following words--\"Ah, long life to your holy reverence's memory,\r\nwhy will you lave your own nate little kingdom, and go to another\r\nwhere they will tink no more of you then they would of an old brogue?\r\nShure, of all the saints in the red-letter calendar, we give you the\r\npreference! och hone! och hone!\" Another Irishman pulls the bull by\r\nthe tail, with the lament, \"Ah, masther, honey, why will you be after\r\nleaving us? What will become of poor Shelagh and all of us, when you\r\nare gone?\" It is a regular Irish case of abduction.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _No. 237. The Farthing Rushlight._]\r\n\r\nThe last example I shall give of the caricatures of Isaac Cruikshank is\r\nthe copy of one entitled \"The Farthing Rushlight,\" which, I need hardly\r\nsay, is a parody on the subject of a well-known song. The rushlight\r\nis the poor old king, George, whom the prince of Wales and his Whig\r\nassociates, Fox, Sheridan, and others, are labouring in vain to blow\r\nout. The latest caricature I possess, bearing the initials of Isaac\r\nCruikshank, was published by Fores, on the 19th of April, 1810, and\r\nis entitled, \"The Last Grand Ministerial Expedition (on the Street,\r\nPiccadilly).\" The subject is the riot on the arrest of sir Francis\r\nBurdett, and it shows that Cruikshank was at this time caricaturing on\r\nthe radical side in politics.\r\n\r\nIsaac Cruikshank left two sons who became distinguished as\r\ncaricaturists, George, already mentioned, and Robert. George\r\nCruikshank, who is still amongst us, has raised caricature in art to\r\nperhaps the highest degree of excellence it has yet reached. He began\r\nas a political caricaturist, in imitation of his father Isaac--in\r\nfact the two brothers are understood to have worked jointly with\r\ntheir father before they engraved on their own account. I have in my\r\nown possession two of his earliest works of this class, published by\r\nFores, of Piccadilly, and dated respectively the 3rd and the 19th of\r\nMarch, 1815. George was then under twenty-one years of age. The first\r\nof these prints is a caricature on the restrictions laid upon the trade\r\nin corn, and is entitled \"The Blessings of Peace, or, the Curse of\r\nthe Corn Bill.\" A foreign boat has arrived, laden with corn at a low\r\nprice--one of the foreign traders holds out a sample and says, \"Here\r\nis de best for 50s.\" A group of bloated aristocrats and landholders\r\nstand on the shore, with a closed storehouse, filled with corn behind\r\nthem; the foremost, warning the boat away with his hand, replies to\r\nthe merchant, \"We won't have it at any price--we are determined to\r\nkeep up our own to 80s., and if the poor can't buy at that price, why\r\nthey must starve. We love money too well to lower our rents again; the\r\nincome tax is taken off.\" One of his companions exclaims, \"No, no, we\r\nwon't have it at all.\" A third adds, \"Ay, ay, let 'em starve, and be\r\nd-- to 'em.\" Upon this another of the foreign merchants cries, \"By\r\ngar, if they will not have it at all, we must throw it overboard!\" and\r\na sailor is carrying this alternative into execution by emptying a\r\nsack into the sea. Another group stands near the closed storehouse--it\r\nconsists of a poor Englishman, his wife with an infant in the arms,\r\nand two ragged children, a boy and a girl. The father is made to say,\r\n\"No, no, masters, I'll not starve; but quit my native country, where\r\nthe poor are crushed by those they labour to support, and retire to one\r\nmore hospitable, and where the arts of the rich do not interpose to\r\ndefeat the providence of God.\" The corn bill was passed in the spring\r\nof 1815, and was the cause of much popular agitation and rioting. The\r\nsecond of these caricatures, on the same subject, is entitled, \"The\r\nScale of Justice reversed,\" and represents the rich exulting over the\r\ndisappearance of the tax on property, while the poor are crushed under\r\nthe weight of taxes which bore only upon them. These two caricatures\r\npresent unmistakable traces of the peculiarities of style of George\r\nCruikshank, but not as yet fully developed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cruikshank rose into great celebrity and popularity as a\r\npolitical caricaturist by his illustrations to the pamphlets of William\r\nHoue, such as \"The Political House that Jack built,\" \"The Political\r\nShowman at Home,\" and others upon the trial of queen Caroline; but this\r\nsort of work suited the taste of the public at that time, and not that\r\nof the artist, which lay in another direction. The ambition of George\r\nCruikshank was to draw what Hogarth called moral comedies, pictures of\r\nsociety carried through a series of acts and scenes, always pointed\r\nwith some great moral; and it must be confessed that he has, through a\r\nlong career, succeeded admirably. He possesses more of the true spirit\r\nof Hogarth than any other artist since Hogarth's time, with greater\r\nskill in drawing. He possesses, even to a greater degree than Hogarth\r\nhimself, that admirable talent of filling a picture with an immense\r\nnumber of figures, every one telling a part of the story, without\r\nwhich, however minute, the whole picture would seem to us incomplete.\r\nThe picture of the \"Camp at Vinegar Hill,\" and one or two other\r\nillustrations to Maxwell's \"History of the Irish Rebellion in 1798,\"\r\nare equal, if not superior, to anything ever produced by Hogarth or by\r\nCallot.\r\n\r\nThe name of George Cruikshank forms a worthy conclusion to the \"History\r\nof Caricature and Grotesque.\" He is the last representative of the\r\ngreat school of caricaturists formed during the reign of George III.\r\nThough there can hardly be said to be a school at the present day, yet\r\nour modern artists in this field have been all formed more or less\r\nunder his influence; and it must not be forgotten that we owe to that\r\ninfluence, and to his example, to a great degree, the cleansing of this\r\nbranch of art from the objectionable characteristics of which I have on\r\nmore than one occasion been obliged to speak. May he still live long\r\namong the friends who not only admire him for his talents, but love him\r\nfor his kindly and genial spirit; and none among them love and admire\r\nhim more sincerely than the author of the present volume.\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Post Office Orders payable                          [DECEMBER, 1874.\r\nat Piccadilly Circus._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                            A List of Books\r\n\r\n                              PUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\n                            CHATTO & WINDUS\r\n\r\n                   74 & 75, _PICCADILLY, LONDON, W._\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                            TURNER GALLERY:\r\n\r\n                      A Series of Sixty Engravings\r\n\r\n       From the Principal Works of JOSEPH MALLORD WILLIAM TURNER.\r\n\r\n                 _With a Memoir and Illustrative Text_\r\n\r\n                       BY RALPH NICHOLSON WORNUM,\r\n\r\n                KEEPER AND SECRETARY, NATIONAL GALLERY.\r\n\r\n      Handsomely half-bound, India Proofs, Royal folio, £10; LARGE\r\n       PAPER copies, Artists' India Proofs, Elephant folio, £20.\r\n\r\n        _A Descriptive Pamphlet will be sent upon application._\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      NEW COPYRIGHT AMERICAN WORK.\r\n\r\n                             LOTOS LEAVES:\r\n\r\n   Comprising Original Stories, Essays, and Poems by <sc>Wilkie\r\n      Collins</sc>, MARK TWAIN, WHITELAW REED, JOHN HAY, NOAH BROOKS,\r\n      JOHN BROUGHAM, EDMUND YATES, P.

Considered\r\n     merely as a composition, it deserves to be classed among the\r\n     best specimens of English prose which our age has produced. It\r\n     contains, indeed, no single passage equal to two or three which\r\n     we could select from the Life of Sheridan; but, as a whole, it\r\n     is immeasurably superior to that work. The style is agreeable,\r\n     clear, and manly, and, when it rises into eloquence, rises\r\n     without effort or ostentation. Nor is the matter inferior to the\r\n     manner. It would be difficult to name a book which exhibits more\r\n     kindness, fairness, and modesty. It has evidently been written,\r\n     not for the purpose of showing--what, however, it often shows--how\r\n     well its author can write, but for the purpose of vindicating,\r\n     as far as truth will permit, the memory of a celebrated man who\r\n     can no longer vindicate himself. Mr. Moore never thrusts himself\r\n     between Lord Byron and the public. With the strongest temptations\r\n     to egotism, he has said no more about himself than the subject\r\n     absolutely required. A great part, indeed the greater part, of\r\n     these volumes consists of extracts from the Letters and Journals\r\n     of Lord Byron; and it is difficult to speak too highly of the\r\n     skill which has been shown in the selection and arrangement....\r\n     It is impossible, on a general survey, to deny that the task has\r\n     been executed with great judgment and great humanity. When we\r\n     consider the life which Lord Byron had led, his petulance, his\r\n     irritability, and his communicativeness, we cannot but admire the\r\n     dexterity with which Mr. Moore has contrived to exhibit so much\r\n     of the character and opinions of his friend, with so little pain\r\n     to the feelings of the living.\"--LORD MACAULAY, in the _Edinburgh\r\n     Review_.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Carols of Cockayne: Vers de Société descriptive of London Life.

It is some consolation, however, to feel that where I\r\n     cannot instruct, I shall certainly not mislead, and that the\r\n     reader will find, under each head, all that is known to, or\r\n     suggested by, the most competent writers I am acquainted with,\r\n     either here or on the Continent.\r\n\r\n     That this work appears in a glossarial form arises from the\r\n     desire of many artists, who have expressed to me the difficulty\r\n     they constantly meet with in their endeavours to ascertain the\r\n     complete form of a garment, or the exact mode of fastening a\r\n     piece of armour, or buckling of a belt, from their study of a\r\n     sepulchral effigy or a figure in an illumination; the attitude of\r\n     the personages represented, or the disposition of other portions\r\n     of their attire, effectually preventing the requisite examination.\r\n\r\n     The books supplying any such information are very few, and the\r\n     best confined to armour or ecclesiastical costume. The only\r\n     English publication of the kind required, that I am aware of,\r\n     is the late Mr. Fairholt's \"Costume in England\" (8vo, London,\r\n     1846), the last two hundred pages of which contain a glossary,\r\n     the most valuable portion whereof are the quotations from old\r\n     plays, mediæval romances, and satirical ballads, containing\r\n     allusions to various articles of attire in fashion at the time\r\n     of their composition. Twenty-eight years have expired since that\r\n     book appeared, and it has been thought that a more comprehensive\r\n     work on the subject than has yet issued from the English press,\r\n     combining the pith of the information of many costly foreign\r\n     publications, and, in its illustrations, keeping in view the\r\n     special requirement of the artist, to which I have alluded, would\r\n     be, in these days of educational progress and critical inquiry, a\r\n     welcome addition to the library of an English gentleman.\r\n\r\n                                                         J.

Crown 8vo,\r\n  cloth extra, pp. 540, 12_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Swinburne's most prejudiced critic cannot, we think, deny\r\n     that 'Bothwell' is a poem of a very high character. Every line\r\n     bears traces of power, individuality, and vivid imagination. The\r\n     versification, while characteristically supple and melodious, also\r\n     attains, in spite of some affectations, to a sustained strength\r\n     and dignity of a remarkable kind. Mr. Swinburne is not only a\r\n     master of the music of language, but he has that indescribable\r\n     touch which discloses the true poet--the touch that lifts from off\r\n     the ground.\"--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n     \"It is not too much to say that, should he never write anything\r\n     more, the poet has by this work firmly established his position,\r\n     and given us a poem upon which his fame may safely rest. He no\r\n     longer indulges in that frequent alliteration, or that oppressive\r\n     wealth of imagery and colour, which gave rhythm and splendour to\r\n     some of his works, but would have been out of place in a grand\r\n     historical poem; we have now a fair opportunity of judging what\r\n     the poet can do when deprived of such adventitious aid,--and the\r\n     verdict is, that he must henceforth rank amongst the first of\r\n     British authors.\"--_Graphic._\r\n\r\n     \"The whole drama flames and rings with high passions and\r\n     great deeds. The imagination is splendid; the style large and\r\n     imperial; the insight into character keen; the blank verse\r\n     varied, sensitive, flexible, alive. Mr. Swinburne has once more\r\n     proved his right to occupy a seat among the lofty singers of our\r\n     land.\"--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n     \"A really grand, statuesque dramatic work.... The reader will\r\n     here find Mr. Swinburne at his very best; if manliness, dignity,\r\n     and fulness of style are superior to mere pleasant singing and\r\n     alliterative lyrics.\"--_Standard._\r\n\r\n     \"Splendid pictures, subtle analyses of passion, and wonderful\r\n     studies of character will repay him who attains the end.... In\r\n     this huge volume are many fine and some unsurpassable things.\r\n     Subtlest traits of character abound, and descriptive passages of\r\n     singular delicacy.\"--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n     \"There can be no doubt of the dramatic force of the poem. It\r\n     is severely simple in its diction, and never dull; there are\r\n     innumerable fine touches on almost every page.\"--_Scotsman._\r\n\r\n     \"'Bothwell' shows us Mr. Swinburne at a point immeasurably\r\n     superior to any that he has yet achieved. It will confirm and\r\n     increase the reputation which his daring genius has already won.\r\n     He has handled a difficult subject with a mastery of art which is\r\n     a true intellectual triumph.\"--_Hour._\r\n\r\n                         *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =Chastelard=: A Tragedy.

A full-length Portrait of each King, whose Charter is\r\n     given--including Edward III., when young, and again at an advanced\r\n     age--adorns the margin. These Portraits, with the exception of\r\n     four which are smaller, and on one sheet of vellum, vary from\r\n     eight to nine inches in length--some in armour, and some in robes\r\n     of state. In addition to these are Portraits of an Archbishop\r\n     in full canonicals, of a Chancellor, and of many of the chief\r\n     Burgesses of the City of Waterford, as well as singularly curious\r\n     Portraits of the Mayors of Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, and\r\n     Cork, figured for the most part in the quaint bipartite costume\r\n     of the Second Richard's reign, though partaking of many of the\r\n     peculiarities of that of Edward III. Altogether this ancient\r\n     work of art is unique of its kind in Ireland, and deserves to\r\n     be rescued from oblivion, by the publication of the unedited\r\n     Charters, and of fac-similes of all the Illuminations. The\r\n     production of such a work would throw much light on the question\r\n     of the art and social habits of the Anglo-Norman settlers in\r\n     Ireland at the close of the fourteenth century. The Charters are,\r\n     many of them, highly important from an historic point of view._\r\n\r\n     _The Illuminations have been accurately traced and coloured for\r\n     the work from a copy carefully made, by permission of the Mayor\r\n     and Corporation of Waterford, by the late George V.
